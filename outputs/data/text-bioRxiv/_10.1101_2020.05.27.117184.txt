ABSTRACT

37

The global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and

38

the associated disease COVID-19, requires therapeutic interventions that can be rapidly

39

identified and translated to clinical care. Traditional drug discovery methods have a >90% failure

40

rate and can take 10-15 years from target identification to clinical use. In contrast, drug

41

repurposing can significantly accelerate translation. We developed a quantitative high-

42

throughput screen to identify efficacious agents against SARS-CoV-2. From a library of 1,425

43

FDA-approved compounds and clinical candidates, we identified 17 dose-responsive

44

compounds with in vitro antiviral efficacy in human liver Huh7 cells and confirmed antiviral

45

efficacy in human colon carcinoma Caco-2, human prostate adenocarcinoma LNCaP, and in a

46

physiologic relevant model of alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (iAEC2s). Additionally, we found

47

that inhibitors of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 infection in

48

vitro. Notably, we discovered that lactoferrin, a glycoprotein classically found in secretory fluids,

49

including mammalian milk, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in the nanomolar range in all cell

50

models with multiple modes of action, including blockage of virus attachment to cellular heparan

51

sulfate and enhancement of interferon responses. Given its safety profile, lactoferrin is a readily

52

translatable therapeutic option for the management of COVID-19.

53

IMPORTANCE

54

Since its emergence in China in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic.

55

Repurposing of FDA-approved drugs is a promising strategy for identifying rapidly deployable

56

treatments for COVID-19. Herein, we developed a pipeline for quantitative high-throughput

57

image-based screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cells that led to the identification of

58

several FDA-approved drugs and clinical candidates with in vitro antiviral activity.

INTRODUCTION

60

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus that

61

emerged in Wuhan, China in November 2019 and rapidly developed into a global pandemic.

62

The associated disease, COVID-19, manifests with an array of symptoms, ranging from flu-like

63

illness and gastrointestinal distress (1, 2) to acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart

64

arrhythmias, strokes, and death (3, 4). Recently, the FDA issued emergency approval of

65

remdesivir, a nucleoside inhibitor prodrug developed for Ebola virus treatment (5). However,

66

there are no established prophylactic strategies or direct antiviral treatments available to limit

67

SARS-CoV-2 infections and to prevent the associated disease COVID-19.

68

Repurposing of FDA-approved drugs is a promising strategy for identifying rapidly deployable

69

treatments for COVID-19. Benefits of repurposing include known safety profiles, robust supply

70

chains, and a short time-frame necessary for development (6). Additionally, approved drugs can

71

serve as chemical probes to understand the biology of viral infection and inform on the

72

molecular targets/pathways that influence SARS-CoV-2 infection. To date, several drug

73

repurposing screening efforts have been reported in various cell systems including non-human

74

primate VeroE6 (7), Huh7.5 (8) and Caco-2 cells (9) with a significant overlap in reported drugs

75

but with wide-ranging potencies. Here, we developed a pipeline for quantitative high-throughput

76

image-based screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection that led to the identification of several FDA-

77

approved drugs and clinical candidates with previously unreported in vitro antiviral activity. We

78

also determined that inhibitors of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway exhibited proviral

79

activity in Huh7. Mechanism of action studies of lactoferrin, the most promising hit, identified

80

that it inhibits viral attachment, enhances antiviral host cell responses, and potentiates the

81

effects of remdesivir.

83

To determine the optimal cell line and assay timing for antiviral drug screening, we assessed

84

SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Vero E6 (African green monkey kidney cells), Caco-2 (human colon

85

adenocarcinoma cells), Huh7 (human hepatocyte carcinoma cells) and LNCaP (human prostate

86

adenocarcinoma). Viral growth kinetics at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.2 revealed that

87

each cell line supported viral infection with peak viral titers at 48 hours post infection (hrs p.i.),

88

except for Caco-2, which took 72 hrs (Fig. S1A). The Huh7 cell line was selected for drug

89

screening because it produced the maximum percentage of infected cells (~20%) at 48 hrs p.i.

90

at a MOI of 0.2, while Caco-2 and LNCaP required higher MOI to show the same infection rates

91

(Fig. S1B). Huh7 also exhibited superior signal to background for N protein staining, and viral

92

infection was detectable at an MOI of as low as 0.004 at 48 hrs p.i. (Fig. S1C).

93

Cell morphological profiling of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells

94

To gain insight into cellular features that are being perturbed upon infection, a cell painting style

95

morphological profiling assay was developed in 384-well plates. A multiplexed fluorescent dye

96

set labeling the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N), nuclei (Hoechst 33342), neutral lipids

97

(HCS LipidTox Green), and cytoplasm (HCS CellMask Orange) was used to capture a wide

98

variety of cellular features relevant to viral infectivity, including nuclear morphology, nuclear

99

texture, and cytoplasmic and cytoskeletal features. Cell level features of infected and uninfected

100

cells were measured using a CellProfiler (7) image analysis pipeline. We observed several

101

prominent features associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the formation of syncytia,

102

cytoplasmic protrusions, multiple cell shapes, and positive/negative N protein staining within the

103

nucleus. Fig. 1A shows multiplexed images of infected and uninfected wells and resulting

104

identification/segmentation of infected cells. To systematically explore the morphologies of

105

infected cells, features were dimensionally reduced via the non-linear uniform manifold

106

approximation and projection (UMAP). The analysis showed five regions of interest (ROI) (Fig.

107

1B) with selected phenotypes. These phenotypes included rounded up cells with intense N

108

staining overlapping with the nuclei (ROI I), diffuse N staining in the cytoplasm of cells with

109

normal shape and size (ROI II), and cells with abnormal cytoplasmic protrusions containing

110

punctate N staining (ROI III) or diffused N staining (ROI IV). Most infected cells, however,

111

clustered in syncytia (ROI V), suggesting that infection in Huh7 propagates primarily through

112

cell-to-cell fusion. Fig. 1C shows split violin plots for prominent features that are perturbed in

113

infected vs. uninfected cells. Viral staining, cytoplasmic intensity (CellMask), and nuclear

114

texture all increase in infected cells. In addition, the neutral lipid droplet content increases and

115

the radial distribution of the lipid droplets shifts outwards from the nucleus towards the plasma

116

membrane. Increased lipid accumulation has been observed previously in Hepatitis C virus-

117

infected Huh7 cells (8). The CellMask intensity is increased in infected cells due to the

118

prevalence of syncytia where the disappearance of cell boundaries increases staining intensity

119

at the cell edge. Collectively, our analysis identifies specific features characteristic of SARS-

120

CoV-2 infected cells.

121
122

Identification of FDA-approved drugs with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2

123

To identify compounds with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, we tested a library of 1,425

124

FDA-approved compounds and rationally included clinical candidates (Supplementary File 1) in

125

Huh7 cells in quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) at five concentrations (50 nM, 250

126

nM, 500 nM, 1000 nM and 2000 nM). Compounds were assessed for their antiviral activity

127

(shown schematically in Fig. 2A) using a CellProfiler (7) image analysis pipeline to: 1) identify

128

infected objects in the N protein image (from a single cell to large syncytia), 2) measure their

129

morphologic features, and then 3) tabulate how many nuclei reside within the infected objects to

130

calculate the total percentage of infected cells per well. To increase the accuracy of identifying

131

true actives and decrease the false negative rate of the assay, a liberal selection criteria was

132

employed to choose drugs for follow-up studies (see methods and Fig. 2A). 132 drugs were

133

selected from qHTS screening or by known activity against SARS, MERS or SARS-CoV-2 and

134

carried forward for triplicate dose-response confirmation. Ultimately, 17 dose-responsive

135

compounds were confirmed with IC50 values of less than 1 µM (Fig. 2B and Supplementary

136

Table 1). These compounds include ten that are novel in vitro observations (domperidone,

137

entecavir, fedratinib, ipratropium bromide, lactoferrin, lomitapide, metoclopramide, S1RA,

138

thioguanine, and Z-FA-FMK), and seven previously reported (amiodarone, bosutinib, verapamil,

139

gilteritinib, clofazimine (9, 10), niclosamide (11), and Remdesivir(12)). The remaining

140

compounds either lacked efficacy, exhibited cytotoxicity (e.g. Digoxin), or were efficacious only

141

at concentrations above 1 µM (e.g. hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine) and were thus not

142

prioritized for follow-up. Collectively, the 17 identified hits could be stratified by compound class

143

as ion channel modulators (amiodarone, verapamil, clofazimine, and S1RA), nucleosides/DNA

144

binders (remdesivir, entecavir, niclosamide, and thioguanine), kinase inhibitors (bosutinib,

145

fedratinib, and gilterinib) and others (Table 1).

146
147

Hit validation in Caco-2, LNCaP, Vero E6 and an iPSC-derived model of alveolar epithelial

148

cells, the iAEC2.

149

To evaluate the translatability of the 17 hits from Huh7 cells in other cell systems, we confirmed

150

activity in LNCaP, Caco-2, and Vero E6 cell lines and in physiologically-relevant iPSC-derived

151

alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (iAEC2s) (13). Antiviral activities across the cell systems are

152

shown in Table 1. iAEC2s were used as a biomimetic model of the human bronchial epithelium

153

that is involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis (14). iAEC2s are permissive to SARS-CoV-2

154

infection, exhibiting 10-20% N protein-positive cells at MOI of 0.2 and 50-60% positivity at MOI

155

of 10. Upon infection, we observed long tubular protrusions that co-stained with viral N protein

156

(Fig. 3A). Additionally, unlike the Huh7 model, the vast majority of infected iAEC2 cells were not

157

present in viral syncytia, suggesting that cell-to-cell spread by cell fusion is limited in this model.

158

Nine out of the 17 hits -amiodarone, lomitapide, ipratropium bromide, gilteritinib, fedratinib, and

159

clofazimine, remdesivir, S1RA and bovine lactoferrin- showed dose-responsive antiviral activity

160

against SARS-CoV-2 in iAECs (Table 1). Remarkably, even at a high MOI of 10, bovine

161

lactoferrin, human lactoferrin, S1RA, and remdesivir (IC50 = 18 nM) retained antiviral activity,

162

reflecting the strong efficacy of these compounds in virus-saturated infection conditions (Fig.

163

3B). Six compounds (Amiodarone, Ipatropium Bromide, Lactoferrin, Lomitapide, Remdesivir, Z-

164

FA-FMK) maintained efficacy across all tested cell systems (Table 1), suggesting the targets are

165

conserved across multiple cell types.

166

Characterization of antiviral hits and identification of compounds that exacerbate viral

167

infection.

168

To stratify compounds, we performed a time-of-addition study with compound added either 4 hrs

169

prior to infection (as done previously in the screen) or 1 hr p.i. (Fig. 4A). We infected Huh7 with

170

SARS-CoV-2 at MOI of 1 and then quantified infection by detecting the positive-strand viral RNA

171

genome by RNAscope (Fig 4B). We found that verapamil, entecavir, and niclosamide lost

172

activity under these experimental conditions (Fig. 4C). Amiodarone, clofazimine, S1RA,

173

lomitapide, Z-FA-FMK, the other nucleoside analogues remdesivir and thioguanine, and the

174

kinase inhibitors bosutinib, fedratinib, and gilterinib retained activity regardless of compound

175

addition pre- or post-infection, suggesting that they inhibit post-binding entry events. Two

176

compounds, ipratropium bromide and metoclopramide, lost activity when added 1 hr p.i.,

177

suggesting a role in viral binding inhibition. Although they share the same molecular target

178

(dopamine D2 receptor), metoclopramide and domperidone seem to exert their antiviral activity

179

with different modes of action, either by directly inhibiting binding or indirect effects on the host.

180

Our screening also identified compounds that exacerbated infection. All Mitogen/Extracellular

181

signal-regulated Kinase (MEK) inhibitors tested (cobimetinib, trametinib, and binimetinib)

182

resulted in a >2-fold increase of viral infection in Huh7 (Fig. 5A, B). To confirm this finding, we

183

performed RNAscope on virus-infected, cobimetinib-treated versus untreated cells 24 and 48

184

hrs p.i. (Fig. 5C). The percentage of viral RNA-positive cells was increased at 48 hrs p.i., but not

185

at 24 hrs p.i., following treatment, suggesting that these compounds could enhance virus

186

spread. In addition, upon treatment with the three MEK inhibitors, and cobimetinib in particular,

187

we observed an increased syncytia size (Fig 5A) and different patterns of localization of viral

188

RNA and S protein within the infected cells (Fig 5C). These immunofluorescence staining

189

patterns suggest a difference in viral compartmentalization and spread in MEK inhibitor-treated

190

cells. The increased infection and the diffuse localization of viral RNA was recapitulated when

191

treating the cells with a molecular probe, U0126 (10 µM), that is commonly used as an inhibitor

192

of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. Taken together, these data highlight the utility of screening

193

FDA-approved compounds as a way of identifying cellular pathways involved in viral infection.

194
195

Lactoferrin blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication at different stages of the viral cycle.

196

The most broadly efficacious hit identified was lactoferrin, a protein found in colostrum and

197

airway epithelium (15). To confirm our previous finding of inhibition of N protein expression by

198

lactoferrin, we infected Huh7 cells with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 0.2) under increasing doses of

199

lactoferrin and measured viral RNA using RT-qPCR at 48 hrs p.i. (Fig. 6A). Lactoferrin exhibited

200

a dose-dependent inhibition of viral replication (Fig. 6A) and retained antiviral activity through a

201

range of MOIs (Fig. 6B). It maintained antiviral activity even when added 1 or 24 hrs after

202

infection, suggesting multiple modes of antiviral action (Fig. 6B). Previous work on lactoferrin in

203

the context of SARS-CoV-1 suggested that lactoferrin blocks viral entry by binding heparan

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.27.117184; this version posted December 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

204

sulfate proteoglycans, which are viral attachment factors (16). Therefore, we performed a viral

205

binding assay by incubating SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 10) in the presence of lactoferrin (1250 nM

206

and 6250 nM) for one hour on ice followed by quantification of viral RNA by RT-qPCR (Fig. 6C).

207

Remdesivir was included as a negative control as it blocks viral infection at a post-binding step.

208

Both concentrations of lactoferrin, but not remdesivir, blocked SARS-CoV-2 attachment to Huh7

209

cells (Fig. 6C). As a positive control, Huh7 cells were treated with NaClO3, a protein sulfation

210

inhibitor that depletes cells of heparan sulfate (17). SARS-CoV-2 binding to cells was reduced

211

in NaClO3-treated cells, and additional lactoferrin treatment did not further reduce binding (Fig.

212

6C). These data suggest that, similar to SARS-CoV-1, lactoferrin blocks viral attachment via

213

neutralizing heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Another potential mechanism of action of lactoferrin

214

is through enhancement of interferon responses, which can then limit viral replication within host

215

cells (18). We therefore evaluated mRNA levels of IFNβ and the interferon-stimulated genes

216

ISG15, MX1, Viperin and IFITM3 in lactoferrin-treated Huh7 cells (Fig. 6D). SARS-CoV-2

217

infection did not result in a robust interferon response consistent with previous studies (19).

218

However, we did detect an upregulation of IFNβ and ISG transcripts in virus-infected and

219

lactoferrin-treated cells, suggesting that the post-entry antiviral activity of lactoferrin is interferon-

220

mediated. To rule out iron chelation as a potential mode of action, iron-saturated hololactoferrin

221

and transferrin were tested in Huh7 cells; the former retained activity and the latter was inactive

222

(Fig. 6E). Given the pronounced single-agent efficacy of lactoferrin, we further tested whether

223

combinations with the FDA-approved agent remdesivir could improve the overall antiviral

224

activity. We found that lactoferrin potentiated the efficacy of remdesivir 8-fold (Fig. 6F),

225

suggesting that lactoferrin could be beneficial in the management of COVID-19 both as a single

226

agent or in combination.

229

In this study, we developed an experimental workflow based on high-content imaging and

230

morphological profiling that allows for rapid screening of FDA-approved compounds, and

231

identified 17 compounds that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Of these, seven were

232

previously reported and serve as a benchmark validation of our endpoints and experimental

233

approach, and ten were hitherto unknown. We evaluated the antiviral activity of the 17 hits

234

identified in Huh7 in three transformed cell lines (VeroE6, Caco-2, and LNcaP) and one non-

235

transformed cell line (iAECs) and observed six compounds (amiodarone, ipratropium bromide,

236

lactoferrin, lomitapide, remdesivir, Z-FA-FMK) exhibiting activity across multiple cell lines.

237

Since the completion of this study (June 2020), over 30 studies reporting SARS-CoV-2 antiviral

238

activity of FDA-approved drugs have been published. A meta-analysis of these in vitro screens

239

(including this effort) show consensus around 11 compounds, with small total overlap between

240

studies (20). This observation suggests that drug screening of FDA-approved compounds is

241

highly dependent on the chosen cell line and infection conditions. It is expected that

242

compounds exerting an antiviral effect through direct binding to viral proteins would be more

243

independent of the chosen cell system rather than drugs modulating host cell factors that can

244

vary widely. For example, we observed conservation of activity across cell systems for

245

remdesivir, which directly inhibits the viral polymerase (21), and also for lomitapide, which is

246

proposed to directly inhibit recombinant SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro)(22).

247

As most FDA-approved drugs are optimized against human molecular targets, active

248

compounds can lead to target identification of host factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Z-

249

FA-FMK is an irreversible cathepsin L inhibitor that exhibits potent antiviral activity in all of the

250

five cell systems tested herein, presumably because cathepsin L has been shown to be an entry

251

factor of SARS-CoV-2 (23, 24). Another hit in our Huh7 screen, fedratinib, was approved by the

252

FDA in 2019 for myeloproliferative neoplasms (25) and is an orally bioavailable semi-selective

253

JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor. JAK inhibitors have been proposed for COVID-19 treatment to specifically

combination with remdesivir was recently granted emergency use authorization by the FDA,

257

while jakotinib (ChiCTR2000030170), and ruxolitinib (ChiCTR2000029580) are currently being

258

evaluated in clinical trials for COVID-19 as potential dual action therapeutics (antiviral and

259

innate immune response).

260

In contrast to the antiviral drug hits, all FDA-approved MEK inhibitors tested exacerbated viral

261

infection, likely by increasing cell-to-cell spread as suggested by the formation of larger syncytia

262

and more diffuse localization of viral RNA and S protein within infected cells (Fig. 5). Intriguingly,

263

in the context of other virus infections, including SARS-CoV-1, pharmacological inhibition of the

264

Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway results in restriction of viral infection (30). This underscores the

265

importance of this pathway during viral infections and warrants further examination into the

266

mechanism of action of this signaling cascade during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

267

This study has generated several clinically testable and readily translatable hypotheses. As an

268

example, we observed potent antiviral activity of ipratropium bromide (Atrovent), a quaternary

269

ammonium salt and muscarinic receptor antagonist that is commonly prescribed for asthma. It is

270

administered via inhalation into the lungs with little systemic absorption. Given its potential

271

mode of action as inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 attachment, prophylaxis or post-exposure treatment

272

with ipratropium bromide may curb infection of the upper respiratory tract and drastically reduce

273

systemic viral spread and development of severe symptoms while achieving beneficial

274

bronchodilation. Similarly, we identified metoclopramide and domperidone, both dopamine D2

275

receptor antagonists used to treat gastrointestinal symptoms, as SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.

276

Gastrointestinal symptoms have been increasingly reported in more than half of the patients

277

infected by SARS-CoV-2 (2). Hence, these compounds may ameliorate GI symptoms during

278

COVID-19 infection, and in addition the reduced viral load in the GI tract could also reduce

279

fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (31).

280

Most noteworthy, our screen identified bovine lactoferrin, a safe and widely available dietary

281

supplement, with multi-modal efficacy in multiple cell systems, including non-transformed and

282

physiologically relevant iAEC2s. Lactoferrin gene expression was shown to be highly

283

upregulated in response to SARS-CoV-1 infection (32) and, in addition to enhancing natural

284

killer cell and neutrophil activity, lactoferrin blocks SARS-CoV-1 attachment through binding to

285

heparan sulfate proteoglycans (15). Here, we showed that lactoferrin has a multi-modal

286

mechanism of action against SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 6). First, it strongly inhibits cellular

287

binding of SARS-CoV-2 to cells via competition with heparan sulfate. Second, it retains antiviral

288

efficacy at 24 hrs p.i. and it modulates host cell immunity through increased expression of

289

interferon and several interferon-stimulated genes. Through heightening the innate immune

290

response of host cells, orally administered lactoferrin could be especially effective in resolving

291

the gastrointestinal symptoms that are present in COVID-19 patients (33) with a mechanism

292

similar to norovirus infection (34). In addition, lactoferrin was previously shown to decrease the

293

production of IL-6 (35), which is one of the key players of the “cytokine storm” produced by

294

SARS-CoV-2 infection (36, 37). Lactoferrin is classified by the FDA as ‘Generally Recognised

295

as Safe’ (GRAS) and therefore may represent a promising therapy for pre- and post-exposure

296

prophylaxis.

297

Combination therapies are likely to be required for effectively treating SARS-CoV-2 infection,

298

and this approach has already shown promise, i.e., combination therapy with interferon β-1b,

299

lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin showed efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in a prospective, open-

300

label, randomized, phase 2 trial (38). Here, we show that lactoferrin potentiates the antiviral

301

activity of remdesivir and could be used in combination therapy with these drugs, which are

302

currently being used or studied for the treatment of COVID-19. Due to its wide availability,

303

limited cost, and strong safety profile, lactoferrin could be a rapidly deployable option for both

304

prophylaxis and the management of COVID-19. Although our findings are promising, further

305

studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of our lead antiviral compounds in animal models

306

and/or clinical studies.

METHODS

309

Cells and virus.

310

Vero E6, Caco-2, LNcaP and Huh7 cells were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s

311

Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Welgene), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal

312

bovine serum (FBS), HEPES, non-essential amino-acids, L-glutamine and 1X Antibiotic-

313

Antimycotic solution (Gibco). iPSC (SPC2 iPSC line, clone SPC2-ST-B2, Boston University)

314

derived alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (iAEC2s) were differentiated and maintained as

315

alveolospheres embedded in 3D Matrigel in "CK+DCI" media, as previously described (Jacob et

316

al. 2019). iAEC2s were passaged approximately every two weeks by dissociation into single

317

cells via the sequential application of dispase (2 mg/ml, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 17105-04) and

318

0.05% trypsin (Invitrogen, 25300054) and re-plated at a density of 400 cells/µl of Matrigel

319

(Corning, 356231), as previously described (39). SARS-CoV-2 WA1 strain was obtained by BEI

320

resources and was propagated in Vero E6 cells. Lack of genetic drift of our viral stock was

321

confirmed by deep sequencing. Viral titers were determined by TCID50 assays in Vero E6 cells

322

(Reed and Muench method) by microscopic scoring. All experiments using SARS-CoV-2 were

323

performed at the University of Michigan under Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) protocols in compliance

324

with containment procedures in laboratories approved for use by the University of Michigan

325

Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and Environment, Health and Safety (EHS).

326

Viral titer determination.

327

Vero E6, Caco-2, LNCaP and Huh7 cells were seeded in a 48-well plate at 2x104 cells/well and

328

incubated overnight at 37°C with 5% CO2. Cells were then infected with SARS-CoV-2 WA1 at a

329

multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.2. One hour after infection, cells were harvested (day 0 of

330

infection) or kept at 37°C for 1, 2 and 3 days p.i.. Viral titer determination was performed by

331

TCID50 assay on Vero E6 cells of the total virus (supernatant and intracellular fraction).

332

Alternatively, cells were harvested with Trizol and total cellular and viral RNA was extracted with

333

the ZymoGen Direct-zol RNA extraction kit. Viral RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR using the

334

2019-nCoV CDC qPCR Probe Assay and the probe set N1 (IDT technologies). IFNβ, viperin,

335

MX1, ISG15, IFITM3 and the housekeeping gene GAPDH mRNA levels were quantified by

336

qPCR with SsoAdvanced™ Universal SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) with specific primers

Viral infectivity assay.

344

384-well plates (Perkin Elmer, 6057300) were seeded with Huh7 cells at 3000 cells/well and

345

allowed to adhere overnight. Compounds were then added to the cells and incubated for 4

346

hours. The plates were then transferred to BSL3 containment and infected with SARS-CoV-2

347

WA1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.2 in a 10 μL addition with shaking to distribute virus.

348

For the final dose-responses curves, porcine trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, T0303) at a final

349

concentration of 2 µg/ml was included during infection. After one hour of absorption, the virus

350

inoculum was removed and fresh media with compound was added. Uninfected cells and

351

vehicle-treated cells were included as positive and negative control, respectively. Two days

352

post-infection, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 minutes at room temperature, permeabilized

353

with 0.3% Triton X-100, and blocked with antibody buffer (1.5% BSA, 1% goat serum and

354

0.0025% Tween 20). The plates were then sealed, surface decontaminated, and transferred to

355

BSL2 for staining with the optimized fluorescent dye-set: anti-nucleocapsid protein (anti-NP)

356

SARS-CoV-2 antibody (Antibodies Online, Cat# ABIN6952432) overnight treatment at 4 °C

357

followed by staining with secondary antibody Alexa-647 (goat anti-mouse, Thermo Fisher,

358

A21235), Hoechst-33342 pentahydrate (bis-benzimide) for nuclei staining (Thermo FIsher,

359

H1398), HCS LipidTOX™ Green Neutral Lipid Stain (Thermo Fisher, H34475), and HCS

360

CellMask™ Orange for cell delineation (Thermo Fisher H32713). iAEC2 maintained in 3D

361

culture were dissociated to single cells and seeded in collagen coated 384-well plates at a

362

seeding density of 8000 cells/well in the presence of 10 µM Y-27632 for the first 72 hours after

363

plating (APExBIO, A3008) to grow to roughly 80% confluence. Infection was performed at MOI

364

of 10 in the presence of 2 µg/ml of trypsin porcine (Sigma-Aldrich, T0303). Staining protocol for

365

the iAEC2s differed slightly with the addition of an anti-acetylated tubulin primary antibody (Cell

366

Signaling, 5335), instead of HCS CellMask Orange, and the use of an additional secondary

367

Alexa 488 antibody (donkey anti-rabbit, Jackson ImmunoResearch, 711-545-152).

368

Compound library.

369

The compound library deployed for drug screening was created using the FDA-Approved Drugs

370

Screening Library (Item No. 23538) from Cayman Chemical Company. This library of 875

371

compounds was supplemented with additional FDA approved drugs and selected clinical

372

candidates from other vendors including MedChemExpress, Sigma Aldrich, and Tocris. Clinical

373

candidates and chemical probes were included if they had any reported antiviral efficacy or had

374

an association with SARS1, MERS or SARS-CoV-2. The library was formatted in five 384-well

compound plates and was dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM. Hololactoferrin (Sigma Aldrich,

376

L4765), apolactoferrin (Jarrow Formulas, 121011), native human lactoferrin (Creative BioMart,

377

LFT-8196H), and transferrin (Sigma Aldrich, T2036) were handled separately and added

378

manually in cell culture media. Dilution plates were generated for qHTS at concentrations of 2

379

mM, 1 mM, 500 μM, 250 μM and 50 μM and compounds were dispensed at 1:1000 dilution.

380

qHTS primary screen and dose response confirmation.

381

For the qHTS screen, compounds were added to cells using a 50 nL pin tool array on a Caliper

382

Life Sciences Sciclone ALH 3000 Advanced Liquid Handling system. Concentrations of 2 μM, 1

383

μM, 500 nM, 250 nM and 50 nM were included for the primary screen. In all dose-response

384

confirmation experiments, compounds were dispensed using an HP D300e Digital Compound

385

Dispenser and normalized to a final DMSO concentration of 0.1% DMSO. Dose response

386

confirmation was performed in triplicate and in 10-point:2-fold dilution. Z-primes for dose

387

response plates ranged between 0.4-0.8.

388

Imaging.

389

Stained cell plates were imaged on both Yokogawa CQ1 and Thermo Fisher CX5 high content

390

microscopes with a 20X/0.45NA LUCPlan FLN objective. Yokogawa CQ1 imaging was

391

performed with four excitation laser lines (405nm/488nm/561nm/640nm) with spinning disc

392

confocal and 100ms exposure times. Laser power was adjusted to yield optimal signal to noise

393

ratio for each channel. Maximum intensity projection images were collected from 5 confocal

394

planes with a 3-micron step size. Laser autofocus was performed and nine fields per well were

395

imaged covering approximately 80% of the well area. The Thermofisher CX5 with LED

396

excitation (386/23nm, 485/20nm, 560/25nm, 650/13nm) was also used and exposure times

397

were optimized to maximize signal/background. Nine fields were collected at a single Z-plane as

determined by image-based autofocus on the Hoechst channel. The primary qHTS screen was

399

performed using CX5 images and all dose-response plates were imaged using the CQ1.

400

Image segmentation and feature extraction and infection score.

401

The open source CellProfiler software (12) was used in an Ubuntu Linux-based distributed

402

Amazon AWS cloud implementation for segmentation, feature extraction, infection scoring and

403

results were written to an Amazon RDS relational database using MySQL. A pipeline was

404

developed to automatically identify infected cells in a field and to enable cell-level morphologic

405

profiling. Infected areas were identified by Otsu thresholding and segmentation using the N-

406

protein image, then all nuclei were identified in a similar manner in the Hoechst-33342 image,

407

and the “relate objects” module was used to relate nuclei to an infected cell area. If a nucleus

408

was found to reside within an infected area, then it and its corresponding cell area was labeled

409

“infected”. The percentage of infected cells was tabulated by dividing the infected cell number

410

by the total cell number summed across all 9 fields per well. To enable morphologic cell

411

profiling, the following regions of interest were defined for feature extraction: nuclei, cell,

412

cytoplasm, nucleoli, neutral lipid droplets and syncytia. Multiple intensity features and radial

413

distributions were measured for each object in each channel and cell size and shape features

414

were measured. Nuclei were segmented using the Hoechst-33342 image and the whole cell

415

mask was generated by expanding the nuclear mask to the edge of the Cell Mask Orange

416

image. Plate-based normalization was performed to account for variability in infection

417

percentage. The assay window was normalized between the positive control wells (32

418

uninfected wells representing 0% inhibition) and the negative control wells (32 infected

419

wells, 0.1% DMSO vehicle treated representing 100% effect). The compound treated wells

420

were scored with the RF model and the efficacy score was normalized to the individual

421

plate.

422

Data pre-processing.

423

Cell level data were pre-processed and analyzed in the open source Knime analytics platform

424

(39). Cell-level data was imported into Knime from MySQL, drug treatment metadata was

425

joined, and features were centered and scaled. Features were pruned for low variance (<5%)

426

and high correlation (>95%) and resulted in 660 features per cell.

427

Statistical methods and hypothesis testing.

428

Dose-response curves were fit and pairwise differences between experimental conditions

429

were tested using Prism (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Other statistical tests

430

including non-parametric Mann-Whitney were performed in the statistical programming

431

language and environment R.

432

UMAP embedding.

433

The embed_umap application of MPLearn (v0.1.0, https://github.com/momeara/MPLearn) was

434

used to generate UMAP embeddings. Briefly, for a set of cells, each feature was per-plate

435

standardized and jointly orthogonalized using sklearn.IncrementalPCA(n_components=379,

436

batch_size=1000). Then, features were embedded into 2 dimensions using umap-learn

437

(v0.4.1)(41). UMAP(n_components=2, n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0, init='spectral',

438

low_memory=True). Embeddings were visualized using Holovies Datashader (v1.12.7) (42),

439

using histogram equalization and the viridis color map.

445

platform (Refactor BioSciences github https://github.com/RefactorBio/acas).

446

Dose-response analysis and compound selection.

447

In qHTS screening, a compound was selected to be carried forward into dose response

448

confirmation when meeting one of the following criteria: 1) Percent infected less than 25% for

449

the median field in at least two concentrations, 2) a dose-response relationship was observed

450

(by inspection) across the five concentrations tested, or 3) compounds of interest not meeting

451

this criteria were carried forward if reported positive in the literature or were being evaluated in

452

clinical trials for COVID-19.

453

Dose response analysis in the confirmation and combinatorial screening.

454

Due to the spatial inhomogeneity of infected cells across a single well, approximately half of the

455

fields were undersaturated, resulting in a reproducible distribution per-well. Total cell and

456

infected cell counts were summed over the 9 fields and percent infected cells was averaged

457

over triplicate wells. Cells treated with known fluorescent compounds, including Clofazimine,

458

were confirmed to not have spectral interference. Dose response curves were fit with Graphpad

459

Prism using a semilog 4-parameter variable slope model.

460

Viral Binding assay.

461

Huh-7 cells were plated in 48-well plates at 100,000 cells per well and allowed to adhere

462

overnight. The following day, compounds were added at the indicated concentration in serum-

463
464

free DMEM and incubated for 1 hour at 4 ℃. Following compound incubation, cells were

465

infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 10 for 1 hour at 4 ℃ to allow for viral binding. Cells were
then washed 3 times with ice cold PBS to remove unbound virus and RNA was extracted by

466

using the Direct-Zol RNA miniprep kit (Zymogen, R2052). Bound virus was then quantified by

Figure 6. Lactoferrin blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication at different stages of the viral cycle. A)
Huh7 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI of 0.2 for 48 hrs and treated with increasing
concentration of lactoferrin (5.75 nM – 5750 nM). Cells were harvested and RNA was extracted.
Viral genome copies were calculated by RT-qPCR with an absolute quantification method. B)
Huh7 were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 1, 5 and 10; MOI of 0 indicates non-infected
cells) and treated with 2.3 μM of lactoferrin at 1 and 24 hrs p.i. Bars indicate the percentage of
infected cells in different conditions. Data is an average of eight replicates. Statistical
significance determined using multiple student’s t-test with the Bonferroni-Dunn method, with
alpha = 0.05. Except for MOI of 0, all conditions (Untreated vs Lactoferrin, 1 hr or Untreated vs
Lactoferrin, 24 hr) differ by p<0.0001. C) Binding assay. Huh7 cells were pre-incubated on ice
with compounds: lactoferrin (100 µg/mL and 500 µg/mL) and remdesivir (10 nM), as a negative
control, for one hour and then infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 10) for 1h on ice. Cells were
then washed thoroughly with PBS to remove unbound virus and viral RNA was quantified by
RT-qPCR. Huh7 cultured in NaClO3 for 7 days, which strips heparan sulfate proteoglycans from
the cell surface, were used as a control for lactoferrin mode of action. Data is shown after
normalization to viral control (100%) and represent an average of N=3 biological replicates with
N=2-3 technical replicates each. Unpaired t-tests with Welch’s correction were performed in
Graphpad Prism to determine significance. *p<0.0001. D) mRNA levels of cellular IFNβ, MX1,
ISG15 and IFITM3 were calculated with ΔΔCt in SARS-CoV-2 infected and lactoferrin (5750
nM)-treated cells over uninfected Huh7. Data are average SD of N=2 biological replicates with
n=3 technical replicates each. Statistical significance was determined using multiple student’s ttest with the Bonferroni-Dunn method with alpha = 0.05. *p<0.001. E) Percentage of SARSCoV-2 infected Huh7 cells upon treatment with bovine apolactoferrin and hololactoferrin, native
human lactoferrin, and transferrin at a concentration of 2.3 μM. F) Dose response of lactoferrin
(0 to 2.3 µM) in combination with remdesivir (0 to 30 nM). Cells were pre-treated with
combination or single therapy and infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 0.2) for 48 hrs.

Supplementary Figure 1: a) Growth kinetics of Vero E6, Huh-7 and Caco-2 cells. Cells were
infected in 48-well plates with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.2 and harvested at day 0 (1h post
adsorption), day 1, 2 and 3. TCID50 determination was performed on the supernatant and cellular
fraction. Graph represents median, SD of N=2 biological replicates with n=3 technical replicate
each. B) Syncytia formation (magenta, anti-SARS-CoV-2 N antibody) in SARS-CoV-2 infected
Vero E6 (left) and Caco2 (right) cells counter stained with Hoechst 33342 (cyan) and anti-SARSCoV-2 N antibody (magenta).[CW1] C) Limit of detection of the assay. Huh-7 cells were infected at
indicated MOI and imaged at 48h p.i. Progressive and more feature-rich syncytia formation was
observed in correlation with an increased MOI and detection was possible with infection as low
as MOI 0.004.
