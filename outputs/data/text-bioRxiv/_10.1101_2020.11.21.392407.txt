ABSTRACT
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing an outbreak of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been undergoing various mutations. The analysis of
the structural and energetic effects of mutations on protein-protein interactions between the
receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or
neutralizing monoclonal antibodies will be beneficial for epidemic surveillance, diagnosis, and
optimization of neutralizing agents. According to the molecular dynamics simulation, a key
mutation N439K in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD region created a new salt bridge which resulted in
greater electrostatic complementarity. Furthermore, the N439K-mutated RBD bound hACE2 with
a higher affinity than wild-type, which may lead to more infectious. In addition, the
N439K-mutated RBD was markedly resistant to the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody
REGN10987, which may lead to the failure of neutralization. These findings would offer guidance
on the development of neutralizing antibodies and the prevention of COVID-19.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, N439K, molecular dynamics, binding free energy, neutralizing

1 INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a single-stranded positive-strand RNA virus
named severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a major threat to public
health worldwide[1-3]. As of 2 August 2020, over 17 million confirmed cases including 675,060
COVID-19 related deaths were reported worldwide according to the World Health Organization
(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports). It has been
reported that SARS-CoV-2 infects humans through the binding of the homo-trimeric spike (S)
glycoprotein to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and this infection mechanism
for viral entry is also used by SARS-CoV[2, 4]. The surface spike glycoprotein including S1 and
S2 subunits is the major antigen of coronaviruses, and S1 binds to host cells whereas S2 mediates
viral membrane fusion. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) mediates the binding of the virus to
host cells, which is a critical step for viral entry[2, 5-7]. According to the high-resolution crystal
structure[8, 9], the receptor-binding motif (RBM) is essential for RBD and contacts highly with

hACE2. The structural characterization of the pre-fusion S protein provides atomic level
information to guide the design and development of antibody[10].
Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies of the immune system, which play an important role in
fighting against viral infections, have been found to target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and exert
neutralization activity by disrupting the virus binding[11-15]. During the virus transmission,
alterations of amino acid in the surface spike protein may significantly alter the virus antigenicity
and the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies. As SARS-CoV-2 spreads around the world, the
mutations in spike protein had been continuously reported[16-20]. There are 930 naturally
occurring missense mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that had been reported in the GISAID
database (Supplementary Table S1), and a key mutation from ASP614 to GLY614 (D614G) in
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein made the virus more infectious than the original strain[21]. However,
most immunogens, testing reagents, and several antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 are based on the S
protein of the Wuhan reference sequence (GenBank: MN908947.3). Among coronaviruses,
missense mutations had been demonstrated to confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies in
MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV[22-24]. In the case of HIV, missense mutations are known to
influence

sensitivity[26], and confer resistance with neutralizing antibodies[27, 28]. The epidemiological
observations have proved the mutations, especially in S protein, provide a plausible mechanism
for the increased observed infectivity and bring challenges to antibody development for
SARS-CoV-2.
Here, we present findings from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the binary
complexes of the RBD domain with the common receptor hACE2 and the neutralizing antibody
CB6/REGN10987, respectively. The structural basics of N439K-mutated RBD-hACE2 complexes
show a new salt bridge and local interaction. The energetic details further indicate that the mutated
RBD-hACE2 complexes show higher affinity than the original strain which are mainly attributed
to the changes in van der Waals and electrostatic energies of some key residues. On the other hand,
N439K reduced the sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies which are mainly attributed to polar
solvation and electrostatic interactions. Taken together, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with
N439K may be more infectious and become resistant to some SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
antibodies.
2 RESULTS
2.1 The diversity of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequence
Our trajectory analysis of SARS-CoV-2 mutations in the COVID-19 pandemic was established on
64039 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences which were downloaded from the Global Initiative for
Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database. The whole-genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 can
be divided into two categories according to their function, the open reading frame (ORF) encoding
non-structural proteins, and the main structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E),
membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). The SARS-CoV-2 sequences were aligned to the Wuhan
reference genome with MAFFT[29], then the amino acid changes were identified based on the
sequence alignment. In general, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is a little low[17], and most
mutations are significantly concentrated in European and North American populations (Fig. 1A).
When observing the frequency of mutations in all genes, the amino acid changes are mostly
distributed in ORF1a, ORF1b, N, and S proteins. Interestingly, the ORF3a protein has a superior

mutation rate in North American and Oceanian populations accounting for 14.81% and 10.22% of
the total protein, respectively (Fig.1A and Supplementary Table S1). The ORF3a protein is also
called “accessory protein”, it can convert the environment inside the infected cell and make holes
on the infected cell membrane. Hence the mutations on ORF3a protein may give virus the ability
to spread efficiently.
Co-mutation may affect the cooperation between the various proteins, which may lead to
meaningful virus evolution and pose challenges to the development of antibodies. To investigate
the co-mutation in SARS-CoV-2, we calculated the co-mutation in all proteins and found most
mutants were not single-site mutations (Fig.1B). Since SARS-CoV-2 infects humans through the
binding of trimeric spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VSB) to hACE2, then we counted all amino
acid variants on S protein (Fig.1C and Supplementary Tab.S1). The variant D614G accounts for
75.92% of 64039 SARS-CoV-2[17], following by D936Y accounts for 1.11%. And more notably,
N439K is the most dominant variant in the RBD region, which accounts for 0.72% of all
SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, there are only 16 mutations on S protein with a mutation rate of more
than 0.16% (Supplementary Tab.S1), and those mutants occur frequently together with the variant
D614G (Fig.1D). All the N439K are included in the D614G interestingly, which is mainly
concentrated in Europe since March 2020 (Supplementary Tab.S1). To conclude, the amino acid
changes seem to have been accumulated progressively over time, among which N439K is the most
dominant variant in the RBD region and should be
to characterize the influence of mutations on pathogen evolution.

2.2 The N439K-Mutated RBD binds hACE2 with higher affinity than wild type
The amino acid sequence of N439K differs from wild-type in that there is a mutation from
Asparagine (N) to Lysine (K) at the 439th amino acid site (Fig.2A). Crystal structures show that
the high contact area of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-hACE2 complex is mainly concentrated in the RBM
region[30, 31], and denoted as CR1, CR2, and CR3[32]. To investigate whether N439K can
influence the interactions between hACE2 and RBD, we exploited 100ns MD simulations of the
binary complexes of hACE2 with RBD (both wild-type and N439K). To further verify the
convergence of MD simulations equilibrium, we estimated the root mean square deviations
(RMSD) of backbone atoms relative to the corresponding crystal structure, and the wild complex
had a relatively smaller average RMSD than the N439K-mutated complex (2.2 vs. 2.4 Å) (Fig.2B
and Tab.1). The structural compactness of each system was elucidated by estimating the radius of
gyration (Rg ), the average Rg values were similar for all the same systems (Tab.1). We also
calculated the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) which indicates the solvent exposure degree,
and SASA values of wild and mutant complexes were 35716 Å2 and 36121 Å2, respectively (Tab.1
and Supplementary Tab.S2). To further investigate the detailed residual atomic fluctuations of
structural elements in wild and mutant complexes, we computed the root mean square fluctuations
(RMSF) for protein Cα atoms and provided insights into the structural fluctuation and flexibility.
Although the flexibility patterns of residues in the N439K-mutated RBD-hACE2 complex display
similar fluctuations with wild-type complex (Fig.2C), certain regions of the two complexes show
differences in flexibility. The wild-type complex showed slightly high fluctuations on hACE2,
while the N439K-hACE2 complex shows much more fluctuation in the RBD domain. Increment
of RMSF values of the N439K RBD domain confirmed that the flexibility changes were
significantly strengthened by the 439th amino acid change. This fluctuation of the variant N439K

might induce structural rearrangements of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-hACE2 complex, possibly
leading to a stronger binding ability.
Subsequently, we performed the hydrogen bond (H-bond) and salt bridge analyses based on
the trajectories in 100ns MD simulations. The results exhibited distinct epitope features between
wild-type and mutant, although they can both engage hACE2. It was observed that the
N439K-mutated RBD-hACE2 complex can form more hydrogen bonds than the wild-type
(Fig.2C). Hydrogen bonds from the N-terminal (CR1) to the central region (CR2) of the interface
were almost the same during MD simulations. However, three additional main-chain hydrogen
bonds forms at Gly496, Gln498, and Val503 in the binding loop (CR3), causing the ridge to take a
more compact conformation and the loop to move closer to hACE2 (Fig.2C). At the SARS-CoV-2
RBD-hACE2 interface, a strong salt bridge[33] between Lys417 of the RBD and Asp30 of hACE2
had been confirmed[8] (Fig.2D). The mutation of N439K in the RBD formed a new salt bridge
with Glu329 of hACE2 (3.6 Å), where Arg426 of SARS-CoV RBD also formed a salt bridge at
the same position[9], and a weak salt bridge between Lys439 and Asp442 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD
(Fig.2D). Burial of these salt bridges in hydrophobic environments on virus binding would
enhance their energy owing to a reduction in the dielectric constant.
To estimate the stabilization of binding systems, We also calculated the molecular mechanics
Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) in both wild and mutant SARS-CoV-2
RBD-hACE2 complexes.[34]. The combination of MD simulation with MM-PBSA incorporated
conformational fluctuations and entropic contributions to the binding energy. The components in
the binding free energy of RBD-hACE2 complexes include ∆Evdw , ∆Eelec , ∆Gpol and ∆Gapol .

Overall, the binding free energy (∆Gbind ) decomposition analysis divulged into various free

energies
(Fig.3B
and
Supplementary
Tab.S3).
The
binding
energy
∆Gbind
(-1526.17+/-133.13kj/mol) of the N439K-hACE2 was higher in magnitude as compared to the
wild-type RBD-hACE2 (-1084.06+/-80.23kj/mol) (Fig.3A), in which the electrostatic energy
between wild and mutant types had a significant difference. Meanwhile, we calculated binding
energy between RBM (residue 438 to 502) and hACE2 using MM-PBSA, and binding energies of
the two complexes were -860.94+/-99.45kj/mol and -398.06+/-111.76kj/mol, respectively (Fig.3C
and Supplementary Tab.S2). Comparing the binding free energy of RBD-hACE2 and
RBM-hACE2, it should be noted that the changes in energy are mainly concentrated in the
RBM-hACE2 region.
Subsequently, we explored the critical residues involved in the RBM-hACE2 binding by
performing the per-residue decomposition of binding free energy (Fig.3D), and the contribution
energy of per-residue to the total binding energy was compared before and after mutation. It is
evident from the line graph (Fig.3D) that Lys439 hotspot residue show more contribution to
binding free energy than ASN439 and its contribution energy changed from -1.93kj/mol to
-249.85kj/mol (Fig.3D). Taken together, comparing the interaction interfaces of the
N439K-mutated and wild RBD-hACE2 complexes reveals the change from ASN439 to LYS439
might result in a tighter association because of the new salt bridge formation and higher affinity.
2.3 N439K became resistant to SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody REGN10987
To investigate the antigenicity of the N439K mutant, we exploited 100ns MD simulations of the
binary complexes of hACE2 with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies REGN10987 and CB6
complexes. Specific neutralizing mAbs can prevent the virus from binding to hACE2 by

neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. Although most of these highly binding sites are in RBM, the two
neutralizing antibodies show different high contact regions with RBD (Fig4.A), REGN10987
binds mainly to CR2 and CR3 regions of RBD where the N439K located, and the main binding
regions of CB6 are CR1 and CR2.
After the 100ns MD simulation, the final conformational distribution indicated the
configuration fluctuations of RBD were mainly concentrated in the CR3, whereas the
REGN10987 antibody was relatively stable (Fig.4B). Overall, SARS-CoV-2 RBD and
REGN10987 undergo symmetric twist and antisymmetric hinge-bending motions about the axis of
the N-terminal helix, corresponding to the lowest quasi-harmonic models, PC1, and PC2, from
principal component analysis (PCA)[35]. Although the overall conformational dynamics were
almost the same between the wild and mutant complexes, the average conformation of the variant
N439K-REGN10987 structure has changed relative to wild complex when the dynamic
configurations are projected onto the two principal vectors (Fig.4C). Interestingly, the comparison
of the crystal structures of two complexes shows a small but significantly conformational
difference, perhaps due to crystal packing restraint. From results of RMSD, the wild and mutant
systems had reached a stable state from their respective MD trajectories, CB6 systems had lower
average RMSD values than the REGN10987 complexes, and a higher RMSD was calculated in
N439K-REGN10987 than wild-type (5.1 vs. 4.1 Å) (Fig.4D). The MD simulation results of the
CB6-RBD complex can be found in Supplementary materials.
To understand the biophysical basis of the molecular recognition of RBD-mAbs complexes,
the MM-PBSA scheme was employed. To further explain the ability of heavy and light chains of
mAbs to neutralize viruses, we had taken 200 structures from the stable region of the last 20ns
trajectories to calculate binding free energy with RBD respectively. It revealed that the estimated
binding free energy of wild-type CB6-RBD complexes (-129.73kj/mol) is higher than
N439K-mutated CB6-RBD complexes (-51.28kj/mol) in the heavy chain, the unfavorable
contribution from ∆Gpol (491.56kj/mol) was relatively higher compared to mutant type
(703.82kj/mol) (Tab.2 and Supplementary Tab.S4). Overall, our research suggested that the
N439K reduced the sensitivity to the CB6 mAb. Subsequently, we have investigated the binding
free energy of REGN10987-RBD complexes, the ∆Gbind of N439K-mutated REGN10987-RBD
complexes (24.10kj/mol) was found to be lower (P=2.22e-16) than wild-type (-85.65kj/mol) in the
heavy chain (Fig.4F). Similarly, the light chain had a little difference in binding free energy with
RBD, but both systems could not form an effective combination (Fig.4E and Tab.2). Furthermore,
the present 100ns trajectory revealed that polar solvation and electrostatic interaction might be the
main factors to lose the ability of the REGN10987 antibody to neutralize COVID-19 (Tab.2).
3 DISCUSSION
The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a severe strain in the public health system in many
countries. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is expected to continue evolving in human populations. Close
monitoring of circulating virus strains is of unquestionable importance to inform research and
development of antibodies and therapeutics. Herein, we have studied the mechanism of binding of
RBD-hACE2 and RBD-mAbs by using an atomistic molecular dynamics simulation of 100ns in
conjunction with molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) scheme. Our
study shows that the variant N439K influences the affinity of both RBD-hACE2 and RBD-mAbs
complexes which is favored by the intermolecular van der Waals, electrostatic interactions and

polar solvation free energy. Our finding may facilitate the development of decoy ligands and
neutralizing antibodies for suppression of viral infection.
It had been reported most amino acid variants in RBD, including the N439K, were less
infectious[21]. However, MD simulations and MM-PBSA results showed that the binding ability
of the N439K-mutated RBD with hACE2 was enhanced, in other words, viral infectivity was
enhanced significantly. Subsequently, we will exploit the contradictory findings from the
following aspects. Firstly, in terms of method, MD simulations and MM-PBSA were widely used
in drug screening, structural analyses, and mutagenesis studies. For instance, a delicate balance of
specific and non-specific hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic networks helped elucidate the
similarities and differences in receptor binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Meanwhile,
these methods can facilitate the ease of finding antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2[36]. In the case of
HIV-1 protease, these were applied to find the loss of flexibility in the mutants which can inhibit
protease activity[37].
Subsequently, the replacement of ARG426 (SARS-CoV RBD) with ASN439 (SARS-CoV-2
RBD) appeared to weaken the interaction by eliminating one important salt bridge with ASP329
on hACE2 and reduced the affinity[8, 9]. Besides, the variant N439K only one amino acid change
from ASN439 to LYS439 (basic amino acid) may result in a tighter association with hACE2 at the
RBD-hACE2 interface because of the formation of a new salt bridge. What’s more, we also found
that the electrostatic interaction may be the main reason for increasing the binding capacity, which
was consistent with the formation of the salt bridge. Finally, we interestingly found the variant
N439K was completely included in the D614G samples (Fig.1D and Supplementary Tab.S1).
D614G was significantly more infectious which had been confirmed, yet there is no report about
the influence of this co-mutation on viral infectivity[17]. To further validate the reliability of MD
simulations, we also exploited another two cryo-EM structures (PDB ID 6LZG and 6VW1) to
simulate and found that the variant N439K still enhanced the infectivity of COVID-19.
Almost all natural variants that affected the reactivity to neutralizing mAbs were located in
the RBD region, we only selected the N439K variant in the RBD region with the most frequent
mutations[11, 13, 14]. The CB6 mAb still could neutralize N439K mutated COVID-19, but
N439K was markedly resistant to the REGN10987 mAb.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is expected to continue evolving, some mutations only appear in a
certain period and other mutations may appear in an unpredictable way. It is necessary to
continuously analyze the SARS-CoV-2 virus according to the mutation frequency and time pattern.
Meanwhile, COVID-19 antibodies are developed based on the Wuhan reference genome, it is
necessary to consider the impact of different mutations on the effectiveness of neutralizing
antibodies. In summary, we have counted the amino acid changes in 64039 COVID-19 and laid
special stress on analyzing the infectivity of the variant N439K in the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the
effectiveness of well-characterized neutralizing mAbs using MD simulations. The variant N439K
enhanced the infectivity of the virus with hACE2 and altered antigenicity to some neutralizing
mAbs. Taken together, our findings shed light on the influence of N439K Variant on SARS-CoV-2
infection efficiency and antigenicity.

4.1 Multi-sequence Alignment and Structure Preparation.
In this study, SARS-CoV-2 sequences were aligned against the Wuhan reference genome

(GenBank: MN908947.3) using MAFFT[29]. The wild-type complexes were directly downloaded
from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6M0J, 6XDG, 7C01) and removed the water molecules
using VMD[38] software. For mutated complexes, firstly wild-type hACE2 and mAbs structures
were obtained by removing the RBD structures from RBD-ACE2 and RBD-mAbs complexes
respectively. Then the mutated SARS-CoV-2 RBD (N439K) structures were constructed using
homology modeling SWISS-MODEL[39]. Finally, the mutated SARS-CoV-2 RBD was aligned
with hACE2 and mAbs based on the RBD-hACE2 and RBD-mAbs structures using PyMOL
software. All structural figures were generated utilizing PyMOL software (https://pymol.org/2/).
4.2 MD Simulation.
For each system, MD simulations were performed using GROMACS 5.14.0, the latest
CHARMM36 force field was selected, an explicit solvent model was used by an explicit TIP3P
(three-point charge) model[40]. Then complexes were solvated in a rectangular periodic box and
had a 10 Å buffer distance from along each side, then a suitable number of Na+ and CL- ions were
added to neutralize the whole system and mimicked a salt solution concentration of 0.15M.
Specifically, the following three stages of MD simulations were performed before the production
simulation: (1) A full 50,000-step energy minimization was performed with all atoms unrestrained.
(2) Each complex was equilibrated with NVT (No. of particles, Volume, and Temperature)
ensemble which temperature of the per-solvated system increased from the 0 to 310K gradually
for 1ns. (3) Subsequently, a 50,000,000-step (100ns) production run was performed after 1ns NPT
using GROMACS. During the MD simulations, the cutoff distances of 12 Å for the long-range
electrostatic through the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME)[41]method and van der Waals interactions
were used, and the time step was set to 2 fs in all MD simulations. The SHAKE algorithm was
employed to calculate the bonds involving hydrogen atoms. Further analyses[42] (RMSD, RMSF,
distances, angles, hydrogen bond calculations, and salt bridge calculations) were performed based
on the resulting trajectories by GROMACS tools. For the H-bond interaction analysis, the two
limiting factors are adopted as follows: (1) donor-acceptor distance is
donor-hydrogen-acceptor angle is

4.3 MM-PBSA Calculation.
Binding free energies of RBDs with hACE2 and mAbs were calculated using MM-PBSA program,
which is the sum of enthalpy (H) and entropy (S) parts. For each binding complex, 200

configurations were taken at an interval of 100ps from the last 20ns simulations. MM-PBSA
was used to calculate the polar solvation energies, nonpolar solvation energies and calculates
the free energy of the complex (the binding free energy of the receptor with ligand in a solvent
medium). The general expression of the term is
