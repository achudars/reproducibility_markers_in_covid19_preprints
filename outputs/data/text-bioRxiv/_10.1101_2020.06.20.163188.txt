Abstract

34

The COVID-19 pandemic has been ongoing since its onset in late November 2019 in

35

Wuhan, China. Understanding and monitoring the genetic evolution of the virus, its

36

geographical characteristics, and its stability are particularly important for controlling the

37

spread of the disease and especially for the development of a universal vaccine covering

38

all circulating strains. From this perspective, we analyzed 30,983 complete SARS-CoV-2

39

genomes from 79 countries located in the six continents and collected from December 24,

40

2019, to May 13, 2020, according to the GISAID database. Our analysis revealed the

41

presence of 3,206 variant sites, with a uniform distribution of mutation types in different

42

geographic areas. Remarkably, a low frequency of recurrent mutations has been

43

observed; only 169 mutations (5.27%) had a prevalence greater than 1% of genomes.

44

Nevertheless, fourteen non-synonymous hotspot mutations (> 10%) have been identified

45

at different locations along the viral genome; eight in ORF1ab polyprotein (in nsp2, nsp3,

46

transmembrane domain, RdRp, helicase, exonuclease, and endoribonuclease), three in

47

nucleocapsid protein and one in each of three proteins: spike, ORF3a, and ORF8.

48

Moreover, 36 non-synonymous mutations were identified in the RBD of the spike protein

49

with a low prevalence (<1%) across all genomes, of which only four could potentially

50

enhance the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the human ACE2 receptor.

51

These results along with mutational frequency dissimilarity and intra-genomic divergence

52

of SARS-CoV-2 could indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 is not yet adapted to its host.

53

Unlike the influenza virus or HIV viruses, the low mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 makes

54

the development of an effective global vaccine very likely.

Introduction

59

The year 2019 ended with the appearance of groups of patients with pneumonia of

60

unknown cause. Initial evidence suggested that the outbreak was associated with a

61

seafood market in Wuhan, China, as reported by local health authorities [1]. The results

62

of the investigations led to the identification of a new coronavirus in affected patients [2].

63

Following its identification on the 7th of January 2020 by the Chinese Center for Disease

64

Control and prevention (CCDC), the new virus and the disease were officially named

65

SARS-CoV-2 (for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2) and COVID-19

66

(for Coronavirus Disease 19), respectively, by the World Health Organization (WHO)

67

[3]. On March 11, 2020, WHO publicly announced the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic as a

68

global pandemic.

69

This virus is likely to remain and continue to spread unless an effective vaccine is

70

developed or a high percentage of the population is infected in order to achieve collective

71

immunity. The development of a vaccine is a long process and is not guaranteed for all

72

infectious diseases. Indeed, some viruses such as influenza and HIV have a high rate of

73

genetic mutations, which makes them prone to antigenic leakage [4,5]. It is therefore

74

important to assess the genetic evolution of the virus and more specifically the regions

75

responsible for its interaction and replication within the host cell. Thus, identifying the

76

conserved and variable regions of the virus could help guide the design and development

77

of anti-SARS- CoV-2 vaccines.

78

The SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the

79

genus Betacoronavirus. The genome size of the SARS-CoV-2 is approximately 30 kb

80

and its genomic structure has followed the characteristics of known genes of the

81

coronavirus [6]. The ORF1ab polyprotein is covering two-thirds of the viral genome and

82

cleaved into many nonstructural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16). The third part of the SARS-

83

CoV-2 genome codes for the main structural proteins; spike (S), envelope (E),

84

nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M). In addition, six ORFs, namely ORF3a, ORF6,

85

ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, and ORF10, are predicted as hypothetical proteins with no

86

known function [7].

87

Protein S is the basis of most candidate vaccines; it binds to membrane receptors in

88

host cells via its RBD and ensures a viral fusion with the host cells [8]. Its main receptor

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.20.163188; this version posted July 31, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

89

is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), although another route via CD147 has

90

also been described [9,10]. The glycans attached to S protein assist the initial attachment

91

of the virus to the host cells and act as a coat that helps the virus to evade the host's

92

immune system. In fact, a previous study has shown that glycans cover about 40% of the

93

surface of the spike protein. However, the ACE2-RBD was found to be the largest and

94

most accessible epitope [11]. Thus, it may be possible to develop a vaccine that targets

95

the spike RBD provided it remains accessible and stable over time. Hence the importance

96

of monitoring the introduction of any mutation that could compromise the potential

97

effectiveness of a candidate vaccine.

98

This study aims to deepen our understanding of the intra-genomic diversity of

99

SARS-CoV-2, by analyzing the mutational frequency and divergence rate in 30,983

100

genomes from six geographic areas (Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America, and

101

Oceania), collected during the first five months after the onset of the virus. These analysis

102

generate new datasets providing a repository of genetic variants from different

103

geographic areas, with particular emphasis on recurrent mutations and their distribution

104

along the viral genome as well as estimating the rate of intraspecific divergence while

105

evaluating the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to its host and the possibility of developing a

106

universal vaccine.

Results

109

Diversity of genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 in six geographic areas

110

A total of 30,983 SARS-CoV2 genomes from 79 countries in six geographic areas

111

(Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America, and Oceania) included in this analysis.

112

According to the GISAID database, the date of collection of the strains was within the

113

first five months following the onset of SARS-CoV-2. A total of 3,206 variant sites were

114

detected compared to the reference genome Wuhan-Hu-1/2019. Then, we analyzed the

115

type of each mutation, highlighting the prevalence of these mutations both in all genomes

116

(worldwide) and in each of the geographic areas studied (Figure 1). Worldwide, 67.96%

117

of mutations had a non-synonymous effect (64.16% have missense effects, 3.77%

118

produce a gain or loss of stop codon and 0.33% produce a loss of start codon), 28.60%

119

were synonymous, while 3.43% of the mutations were localized in the intergenic regions,

120

mainly in the untranslated regions (UTR). Likewise, the comparison between the six

121

geographic areas shows a similar trend with a uniform distribution of the prevalence of

122

each type of mutation.

123

The frequency of mutations in the six geographic areas was estimated by normalizing the

124

number of genomes carrying a given mutation per the total number of genomes recovered

125

by geographic area. Only 169 (5.27%) variant sites were found with a frequency greater

126

than 0.01 (Figure 2A), and were distributed in six geographic areas as follow: 69 in

127

Oceania, 65 in Africa, 54 in Asia, 31 in Europe, 43 in North America, and 43 in South

128

America. Focusing on non-synonymous mutations (with a frequency> 0.01), 3.34% (n =

129

107) of the total mutations were identified (Figure 2B).

130

The polyprotein ORF1ab contained approximately two thirds of these muations (63.55%;

131

n = 68) and distributed in thirteen non-structural proteins; nsp3-Multi-domain: 15.89%,

132

nsp2: 11.21%, nsp12-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp): 8.41%, nsp4-

133

134

endoribonuclease (NendoU): 4.67%, nsp5-main proteinase (Mpro): 3.74%, nsp14-

135

exonuclease (ExoN): 3.74%, nsp6-TM: 2.80%, nsp1: 0.93%, nsp7: 0.93%, nsp8: 0.93%

136

and nsp16-2'-O-ribose methyltransferase (OMT): 0.93%. The rest (36.45%) were

137

distributed in eight proteins, including N (11.21%), S (8.41%), ORF3a (5.61%), ORF8

138

(4.67%), M (1.87%), ORF6 (1.87%), ORF7a (1.87%) and ORF7b (0.93%).

139

Comparative analysis of these non-synonymous mutations shows only nine that have

140

been shared in the six geographic areas,: T265I (nsp2), L3606F (in nsp6-TM) T4847I (in

141

nsp12-RdRp), D614G (in S), R203K-G204R (in N), Q57H-G251V (in ORF3a) and L84S

142

(in ORF8). It is also interesting to note that none of the nine non-synonymous mutations

143

(> 0.01) of S protein was localized in RBD. The 36 non-synonymous mutations (35 with

144

a missense effect and 1 with a stop gain effect) found in this area had a low frequency (<

145

0.01) across all genomes. Among them, only two mutations were shared between

146

genomes of different geographic areas; the V367F mutation was identified in in Europe,

147

Asia, and North America, the V367F mutation has been identified in Europe, Asia and

148

North America, while P491L in Asia and Oceania.

150

Geographical distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 hotspot mutations

151

Comparative genomic analysis of each geographic area revealed fourteen non-

152

synonymous mutations with a frequency greater than 0.1 and considered as hotspot

153

mutations (Figure 3). Eight mutations of them were found in the ORF1ab polyprotein,

154

distributed in seven regions coding for nsp2 (T265I), nsp3-Multi-domain (T2016K),

155

nsp6-TM (L3606F), nsp12-RdRp (T5020I and T4847I), nsp13-helicase (M5865V),

156

nsp14-ExoN (D5932T) and nsp15-NendoU (Ter6668W). Moreover, three mutations in N

157

protein (R203K, G204R, and P13L) and one in each of the three proteins; S (D614G),

158

ORF3a (Q57H) and ORF8 (L84S).

159

Different patterns of these non-synonymous hot spot mutations were observed between

160

the six geographic regions. Only two mutations were common in the six geographical

161

regions: the high-frequency mutation D614G (in S) and the Q57H mutation (in ORF3a).

162

Seven mutations were more frequent in a single geographic region, including two

163

mutations T2016K (in nsp3-Multi-domain) and P13L (in N) in Asia, two mutations

164

M5865V (in nsp13-helicase) and D5932T (in nsp14-ExoN) in North America, one

165

T5020I (in nsp12-RdRp) in Africa, one T4847I (in nsp12-RdRp) in Europe and one

166

Ter6668W (in nsp15-NendoU) in South America. However, the other five non-

167

synonymous hotspot mutations were variable between the six geographical regions,

168

including two R203K and G204R (in N) that were particularly predominant in Africa,

169

Europe, South America, and Oceania. Whereas, L3606F (in nsp6-TM) was common in

170

Africa, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. Thus, L84S (in ORF8) was found in Asia, North

171

America, and Oceania. In addition, T265I (in nsp2) was frequent in Asia, North America,

172

South America, and Oceania.

173
174

The distribution of hotspot mutation patterns of SARS-CoV-2 over time

175

In order to systematically investigate the appearance of each non-synonymous hotspot

176

mutations, we analyzed each genome in each geographical area over time, classifying

177

them per date of sample collection (according to GISAID database). We have noticed that

178

the distribution of the fourteen hotspot mutations patterns is dynamic during the

179

propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in different geographic regions.

180

Among the fourteen hotspot mutations, four first appeared in January 2020, seven in-

181

February 2020, and three in the first two weeks of March 2020, (Figure 4).

182

The high-frequency mutation D614G (in S), appeared on January 24th, 2020, in Asia

183

(China), next it was observed in Europe (Germany) after four days, and then it gained

184

predominance over time due to its spread to many European countries. In late February,

185

this mutation was also reported in Africa (Nigeria and Senegal), South America (Brazil),

186

North America (Mexico and USA), and Oceania (Australia).

187

The L84S mutation (in ORF8) appeared on January 05th, 2020 in Asia (China), then the

188

emergence of this mutation was observed in the second half of February in the North

189

American and Oceanic regions, particularly in the USA and Australia, respectively. For

190

L3606F (in nsp6-TM) emerged in the third week of January in Asia (China), then

191

propagated in late January in Europe (France and Italy), then in the third week of

192

February and March 2020, in Oceania (Australia) and Africa (DRC and Senegal),

193

respectively. While the mutation D5932T (in nsp14-ExoN) appeared on January 19th,

194

2020, particularly in North America (USA).

195

Among the hotspot mutations that first appeared in February 2020, three within the N

196

protein gene (R203K, G204R, and P13L) gained their predominance during the COVID-

197

19 pandemic. Indeed, the double mutations R203K-G204R emerged on the same date in

198

different geographic areas; February 24th in Europe, February 27th in Africa (in Nigeria),

199

March 2nd in Oceania (New Zealand) and March 04th, 2020, in South America (Brazil).

200

Meanwhile the P13L appeared in late February, particularly in Asia (Korea). We also

201

noticed an increase in the frequency of the Q57H mutation (in ORF3a) in late February in

202

Africa (Senegal), Europe (France and Belgium) and North America (USA and Canada). It

203

was also observed in the three other regions at the beginning of March in Asia (Taiwan),

204

Oceania (Australia) and South America (Brazil). Thus, we found that the T265I (in nsp2)

205

mutation first appeared in late February in both Asia (Taiwan) and North America

206

(USA), while it was spread at the beginning of March in South America (Brazil) and

207

Oceania (Australia). In addition, T4847I (in nsp12-RdRp) gained predominance from the

208

second week of February in Europe (United Kingdom), then after one month spread in

209

Oceania (Australia). While the frequency of the M5865V mutation (in nsp13-helicase)

210

has increased particularly in North America (USA).

211

For the three hotspot mutations that appeared during the first two weeks of March 2020,

212

were found with a frequency greater than 0.1 in genomes belonging to a single geo-

213

graphic region, including T2016K (in nsp3-Multi-domain), Ter6668W (in nsp15-Nen-

214

doU) and T5020I (in nsp12-RdRp) in Asia (Taiwan), South America (Chile) and Africa

215

(Senegal), respectively.

216
217

Mutagenesis of D614G and impact of RBD mutations on the binding ability of spike

218

to ACE2

219

As shown the Figure 5, the non-synonymous D614G mutation did not have an impact on

220

the two- or three-dimensional structure of the spike glycoprotein. However, D614 residue

221

in the wild type spike is involved in three hydrogen bonds; one with A647 in the same

222

subunit (S1) and two bonds with THR-859 and LYS-854 located at S2 subunit of the

223

adjacent protomer (Figure 5A). The substitution of D614 by G in the mutant spike

224

resulted in the loss of the two hydrogen bonds with THR-859 and LYS-854 in the S2

225

subunit of the adjacent protomer (Figure 5B). Such modification could result in a weak

226

interaction between S1 and S2 subunits and thus increases the rate of S1/S2 cleavage,

227

which will improve the virus entry to host cells.

228

To evaluate the effect of RBD mutations on the binding affinity of the spike protein to

229

ACE2, the MM-GBSA method was employed to calculate the binding affinity of 35 spike

230

mutants to ACE2 (except for the stop-gain mutation). Four mutations potentially enhance

231

the binding affinity of spike/ACE2 complex by more than -1.0 kcal/mol, while nine were

232

shown to potentially reduce its affinity by more than 1.0 kcal/mol (Table 1). However,

233

the remaining 22 did not significantly affect the binding affinity of spike to ACE2.

234
235

Clustering and divergence of SARS-CoV-2 genomes

236

This section aims to identify countries sharing similar trends in mutational frequencies.

237

The clustering with Jaccard distance between the genomes of each country based on their

238

mutational frequencies showed two main clusters (cluster 1 and cluster 2) (Figure 6),

239

each subdivided into several sub-clusters (SCs) and these two clusters include the

240

countries of the six continents. In addition, the countries in group 2 were closer to each

241

other than those in cluster 1, demonstrating high genetic similarities between strains from

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.20.163188; this version posted July 31, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

242

these countries. We also observed fifteen SCs with a distance of less than 0.5 (Fig 6,

243

Table 2), including ten SCs belonging to Cluster 2. Remarkably, most of the countries

244

grouped in these fifteen SCs are geographically close, of which eleven SCs include

245

countries of the same continent, especially Asia and Europe.

246

Meanwhile, the intraspecific divergence of SARS-CoV-2 was also assessed in the

247

genomes of each country compared to the genome reference Wuhan-Hu-1/2019. As

248

shown in Figure 7A the overall circulating strains in more than 50 countries seem to

249

have a divergence percentage of less than 0.1%, which indicates that the majority of

250

SARS-CoV-2 genomes have developed less than 18 mutations in them.

251

The highest percentage of divergence in Asia, Europe, North America, South America,

252

Oceania, and Africa was observed in Hong Kong (0.45%), Serbia (0.42%) Mexico

253

(0.07%), Colombia (0.05%), Guam (0.05%) and Gambia (0.43%), respectively. While the

254

lowest percentage was shown in Portugal (0.01), Canada (0.05%), Bangladesh (0.02%),

255

Peru (0.01%), New Zealand (0.02%) and DRC (0.03%).

256

Moreover, the phylogenetic divergence tree (Figure 7B) shows that the highest rate was

257

among genomes from Asia, followed by Europe, and North America. In Asia, most

258

strains showed a divergence of 0.0221 to 0.0231. Likewise, European strains clustered

259

between 0.0223 and 0.0231, while North American strains had a divergence of 0.0221 to

260

0.0230. Using the Nextstrain clade nomenclature, we can identify two main clades with

261

different divergence profiles; first and most divergent “A2” clade, although the first strain

262

observed was from China. This clade mainly contains genomes from Europe. The second

263

“B1” clade appears to be less divergent and to a large extent includes Asian strains.

264

Nevertheless, the genomes of Africa, North America, and South America have been

265

scattered across the phylogenetic divergence tree without a specific coating.

266

The rate of divergence also varied within clades, A2 includes three subclades, the sub-c2

267

harboring the Q57H mutation, having a divergence of 0.0224 to 0.0229, and mainly

268

includes strains from North America and North America. 'Asia. The sub-c3 containing

269

mostly European genomes sharing the R203K mutation, in this subclade a low rate of

270

divergence was observed in all continents except Africa, while the greatest divergence

271

was a strain from Taiwan (Asia ) (> 0.0223).

272

On the other hand, clad 2 (B1) harbored mainly genomes from North America and Asia,

273

while the high divergence in this clade observed in Europe (France) with 0.0231. The

274

sub-c2 and sub-c3 of this clade appeared to be the most diverse with the lowest

275

divergence in the United Kingdom and the highest in Australia.

Phylogenetics and spatio-dynamics of SARS-CoV-2

278

The topology of the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree (Figure 8A) shows a clear

279

clustering: one cluster containing mainly Asian strains, while the second containing

280

European strains with a specific clade sharing the D614G mutation. For each cluster, we

281

identified different clades: cluster I containing two main clades A1a and B1 harboring

282

mainly strains from Asia, North America, and Asia, Europe, respectively. However,

283

cluster II harbored three clades: B2, A2, A2a without a specific pattern.

284

The distribution of African genomes across the phylogenetic tree showed a close

285

relationship with different continents. In the first clade, African genomes (mainly from

286

South West Africa) clustered with Asia and showed the lowest divergence rate.

287

Meanwhile, genomes clustering in the European clade sharing the three-pattern mutations

288

mostly common in Europe: G28881A, G28882A, and G28883C.

289

The map (Figure 8B) shows the spatio-dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and provides an

290

insight into the viral strain's potential geographical origin based on the sample used and

291

displays a complex and interconnected network of strains. From these samples, strains

292

from Asia appear to have diverged and resulted in other strains in all the investigated

293

regions. European strains seem to have given rise to those in North America, South

294

America and Africa, with multiple divergent strains within Europe itself. Similarly, with

295

less frequency, strains from South and North America appear to be related to some

296

divergent strains in Europe and Asia.

Discussion

299

Due to the rapid spread and mortality rate of the new SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the

300

development of an effective vaccine against this virus is of a high priority [12]. The

301

availability of the first viral sequence derived during the COVID-19 epidemic, Wuhan-

302

Hu-1, was published on January 5th, 2020. From this date, numerous vaccination

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.20.163188; this version posted July 31, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

303

programs were launched [13,14]. Furthermore, drugs and vaccines should target

304

relatively invariant and highly constrained regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, in order

305

to avoid drug resistance and vaccine escape [15]. For this, monitoring genomic changes

306

in the virus are essential and play a pivotal role in all of the above efforts, due to the

307

appearance of genetic variants, which could have an effect on the efficacy of vaccines. In

308

this study, we investigated the genetic diversity of the 30,983 complete SARS-CoV-2

309

genomes isolated from six geographic areas.

310

Our results showed three different situations of the identified mutations; (i) the mutations

311

that have developed and are gaining a predominance in the six geographic areas; (ii)

312

mutations which were predominant only in certain geographic regions and (iii) mutations

313

apparently expanding, but low in frequency in all isolates studied. From this third

314

situation, it is interesting to note that a low rate of recurrent mutations was found across

315

genomes, with only 5.27% of the total mutations having a frequency greater than 0.01.

316

While 94.73% had a frequency of less than 0.01, of which 49.68% were single mutations

317

(specific to a genome). These results indicate that, so far, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved

318

through a non-deterministic process and that random genetic drift has played the

319

dominant role in the spread of low-frequency mutations worldwide, suggesting that the

320

SARS-CoV-2 is not yet adapted to its host, and epidemiological factors are particularly

321

responsible for the global evolution of this virus. Although some hotspot mutations have

322

increased their frequencies, they have systematically gained their predominance outside

323

Asia. For example, the hotspot mutation Q57H (in ORF3a), on February 21st, 2020, has

324

not yet been observed among isolates from China, while it has emerged in Europe and

325

also spread in isolates from North America. Likewise, seven other mutation hotspots saw

326

their frequencies in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes to be increased over time outside of Asia;

327

including, double mutations R203K-G204R of protein N (in Europe, South America, and

328

Oceania), M5865V of nsp13-helicase and D5932T of nsp14-ExoN (in North America),

329

T5020I of nsp12-RdRp (in Africa), T4847I from nsp12-RdRp (in Europe and Oceania),

330

Ter6668W from nsp15-NendoU (in South America).

331

It is interesting to note that the ORF10 protein was the only invariant protein in recurrent

332

mutations. In our recent study [16], we reported the absence of this protein in certain

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.20.163188; this version posted July 31, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

333

SARS-CoV-2 genomes, which could explain a rate of low-frequency mutations of this

334

protein. Without neglecting also its small size compared to other proteins.

335

A low rate of divergence was found in the genomes of each country compared to the

336

reference genomes Wuhan-Hu-1/2019. Indeed, China was the source of the original

337

variant, it had a high divergence rate among most of the countries in different

338

geographies. This could suggest early and rapid transmission of infections to the worst-

339

affected countries of Europe and America by variants genetically close to the original

340

strain. The rapid transmission meaning a single source leading to multiple infections, thus

341

giving the virus fewer life cycles to change. When the disease spreads slowly, the virus

342

goes through several cycles of spread and is therefore likely to be more different from the

343

original variant. This is consistent with a previous study describing a continued tendency

344

for the virus to diverge over time [17]. In addition, accumulations of mutations have been

345

shown to aid the adaptation of the virus to the human host by optimizing codon use

346

through synonymous mutations [18]. Overall, this study showed an intraspecific SARS-

347

CoV-2 divergence rate of less than 0.5% across the genomes of each country. Comparing

348

all countries the high rate of discrepancy in Asian countries could be due to multiple

349

sources of infection with different strains at the start of the epidemic. Likewise, intra-

350

genomic clustering did not have a clear pattern regarding their geographic distributions,

351

reflecting the effect of migration and globalization as previously indicated [19,20].

352

The phylogenetic tree confirms that disease transmission in Africa probably has three

353

sources. The least divergent variants were grouped with Asia while the most divergent

354

were grouped with Europe and North America. This distribution points to different

355

sources of infection; countries in West and North Africa probably had their carriers from

356

European countries. While South American genomes appear to originate from North

357

America and Europe. While some strains from Oceania and Africa allow poor monitoring

358

of the origin of the infection but show a close relationship with the genomes of Europe.

359

Taken together, the North American and European genomes appear to be responsible for

360

most of the spread of the disease.

361

As the virus spreads more widely around the world, it is important to follow the

362

appearance of new mutations development that could compromise the effectiveness of a

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.20.163188; this version posted July 31, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

363

candidate vaccine. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is the primary target of most vaccine

364

candidates that are under development, due to its key role in mediating entry of the virus

365

and its immunogenic trait [8,21]. Analysis of S protein in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes that

366

we collected in this study revealed a hotspot mutation at position 614 that involves the

367

change from a large amino acid residue (aspartic acid) to a small hydrophobic one

368

(glycine). This mutation was most frequent in the genomes of six geographical areas.

369

Several studies had already indicated its emergence [16,22-25]. The D614G mutation is

370

proximal to the S1 cleavage domain of the spike glycoprotein [26]. Our finding showed

371

that this mutation induces a loss of two hydrogen bonds between the S1 and S2 subunits

372

of neighboring protomers and may, therefore, increase the cleavage rate of these subunits

373

in the pre-fusion state of the spike protein to allow its conformational transition to the

374

post-fusion state that is associated with membrane fusion during virus entry [27].

375

However, our structural modeling of this mutation has shown no substantial impact on

376

the secondary or tertiary structure of the spike protein which makes the likelihood of this

377

variant significantly affect a potential epitope in this region very low. From a clinical

378

perspective, there is no evidence that this mutation affects the transmissibility and

379

virulence of SARS-CoV-2 due to the lack of association between the D614G mutation

380

and patient hospitalization status [28] . With this in mind, we believe that this will not

381

present a serious issue for vaccine development and that a universal candidate vaccine for

382

all circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 may be possible.

383

On the other hand, the RBD of S protein, allows the virus to bind to the ACE2 receptor

384

on host cells [29,30]. Mutations in this receptor are a likely route to escape recognition of

385

antibodies, as described in other viruses [31,32]. In all of the genomes analyzed in this

386

study, only 36 non-synonymous mutations in RBD have been identified. These mutations

387

observed at low frequency (< 0.01) in all genomes, the calculated binding free energy of

388

mutant RBDs of spike protein in complex with ACE -2 demonstrate that in 89% of the

389

cases these mutations decrease or does not significantly affect the ability of the virus to

390

bind to the host cells receptor. While only 11% potentially enhance the binding of the

391

viral spike protein to ACE-2 and therefore could influence the pathogenicity of SARS-

392

CoV-2.

393

SARS-CoV-2 has only been identified recently in the human population; a short time

394

compared to the adaptive processes that could take years to occur. Although we cannot

395

predict whether adaptive selection will be observed in SARS-CoV-2 in the future, the

396

main conclusion is that the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses constitute a

397

homogeneous viral population.

398

This study is a comprehensive report on the amino acid mutations that spread during the

399

SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, from December 24th to May 13th. We can, therefore, be cau-

400

tiously optimistic that, up to now, genetic diversity should not be an obstacle to the devel-

401

opment of a broad protection SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Therefore, ongoing monitoring of

402

the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 will be essential to better understand the host-

403

pathogen interactions that can help inform drug and vaccine design.

Data collection

407

Full-length viral nucleotide sequences of 30,983 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were collected

408

from the GISAID EpiCovTM (update: 26-05-2020) [33], belonging to the six

409

geographical zones (according to GISAID database) and distributed in 79 countries as

410

follow: 214 from Africa, 368 from South America, 1,590 from Oceania, 2,111 from Asia,

411

6,825 from North America and 19,875 from Europe. The genomes were obtained from

412

samples collected from December 24, 2019, to May 13, 2020.

413

For each geographical area the collection date of the samples is from February 27 th to

414

May 01st for Africa, December 24th to May 13th for Asia, January 23th to May 10 th for

415

Europe, January 19th to May 12th for North America, February 25th to April 19th and

Variant calling analysis

419

Genome sequences were mapped to the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 (Genbank

420

ID: NC_045512.2) using Minimap v2.12-r847 [34]. The BAM files were sorted by

421

SAMtools sort [35]. The final sorted BAM files were used to call the genetic variants in

422

variant call format (VCF) by SAMtools mpileup and BCFtools [35]. The final call set of

423

the 30,983 genomes, was annotated and their impact was predicted using SnpEff v 4.3t

424

[36]. For that, the SnpEff databases were first built locally using annotations of the

425

reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 obtained in the GFF format from NCBI database.

426

Then, the SnpEff database was used to annotate SNPs and InDels with putative functional

D614G mutagenesis analysis

431

To investigate the possible impact of the most frequent D614G mutation, we conducted

432

an in-silico mutagenesis analysis based on the CryoEM structure of the spike protein in

433

its pre-fusion conformation (PDB id 6VSB). Modelling of the D614G mutation was done

434

using UCSF Chimera [37]. Then, the mutant structure was relaxed by 1000 steps of

435

steepest descent (SD) and 1000 steps of conjugate gradient (CG) energy minimizations

436

keeping all atoms with more than 5A from G614 fixed. Comparative analysis of D614

437

(wild type) and G614 (mutant) interactions with their surrounding residues was done in

438

PyMOL 2.3 (Schrodinger L.L.C).

439
440

RBD mutations and Spike/ACE2 binding affinity

441

Modelling of RBD mutations was performed by UCSF chimera [37] using the 6M0J

442

structure of the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type spike in complex with human ACE2 as a tem-

443

plate. Mutant models were relaxed by 1000 steps of SD followed by 1000 steps of CG

444

minimizations keeping all atoms far by more than 5A from the mutated residues fixed.

445

Changes in the binding affinity of the spike/ACE2 complex for each spike mutant were

446

estimated by the MM-GBSA method using the HawkDock server [38].

447
448

Clustering and ivergence analysis

449

To evaluate the clustering with jaccrd distance between the genomes of each country

450

based on their mutational frequencies, first the genomes were grouped in their countries

451

of origin, then the mutation frequency was normalized individually (for each country),

452

the matrix distance between countries was then measured using Jaccard Distance.

453

On the other hand, to calculate the intra-specific divergence of SARS-CoV-2, we used

454

the Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 genome as a reference sequence, and the other 30,983 genomes

455

were also sorted by country of origin. . The divergence was first calculated by estimating

456

the similarities of the genomes with the reference sequence by grouping genomes from

457

the same country using CD-Hit. [39]. All SARS-CoV-2 genomes used in this study were

458

included except those from Ghana which were excluded from this analysis due to the

459

high number of Ns. The percentage of similarity was then recovered to 100%. Then the

460

percentage of divergence for each country was calculated using the following formula:

467

Phylogenetic and spatio-dynamic analysis

468

We generated a phylogenetic and divergence tree, as well as a genomic epidemiology

469

map based on the 30,983 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 using NextStrain tools

470

(https://nextstrain.org) [40]. The tree was constructed in IQ-TREE v1.5.5 [41] using the

471

maximum likelihood method under the GTR model. The rate of evolution and the Time

472

to the Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) were estimated using ML dating in the

473

Tree Time package [42].

Figure 5: Comparison of spike wild type residue ASP-614 (A) and the mutated GLY-614
(B). ASP-614 (green sticks) in subunit S1 (yellow) is involved in two hydrogen bonds
with THR-859 and LYS-854 from the S2 subunit (pink). The substitution of ASP by
GLY at position 614 causes the loss of the two hydrogen bonds between S1 subunit and
THR-859 and LYS-854 in the S2 subunit (pink).
