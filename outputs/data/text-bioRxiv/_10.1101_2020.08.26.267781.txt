Abstract

17

COVID-19 and its causative pathogen SARS-CoV-2 have rushed the world into a staggering

18

pandemic in a few months and a global fight against both is still going on. Here, we describe

19

an analysis procedure where genome composition and its variables are related, through the

20

genetic code, to molecular mechanisms based on understanding of RNA replication and its

21

feedback loop from mutation to viral proteome sequence fraternity including effective sites on

22

replicase-transcriptase complex. Our analysis starts with primary sequence information and

23

identity-based phylogeny based on 22,051 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and evaluation of

24

sequence variation patterns as mutation spectrum and its 12 permutations among organized

25

clades tailored to two key mechanisms: strand-biased and function-associated mutations. Our

26

findings include: (1) The most dominant mutation is C-to-U permutation whose abundant

27

second-codon-position counts alter amino acid composition toward higher molecular weight

28

and lower hydrophobicity albeit assumed most slightly deleterious. (2) The second abundance

29

group includes: three negative-strand mutations U-to-C, A-to-G, G-to-A and a positive-strand

30

mutation G-to-U generated through an identical mechanism as C-to-U. (3) A clade-associated

31

and biased mutation trend is found attributable to elevated level of the negative-sense strand

synthesis. (4) Within-clade permutation variation is very informative for associating non-

33

synonymous mutations and viral proteome changes. These findings demand a bioinformatics

34

platform where emerging mutations are mapped on to mostly subtle but fast-adjusting viral

35

proteomes and transcriptomes to provide biological and clinical information after logical

36

convergence for effective pharmaceutical and diagnostic applications. Such thoughts and

37

actions are in desperate need, especially in the middle of the War against COVID-19.

Introduction

42

COVID-19, a novel pneumonia epidemic causing an outbreak first identified and reported in

43

Dec 2019 from China [1] and subsequently spread to other countries swiftly, has been posing

44

enormous professional, economic, and political challenges to global health services and

45

hazardous control systems. As of 12 June 2020, there have been 7,410,510 confirmed cases

46

and 418,294 deaths reported [2]. COVID-19 is of great contagious (even at incubation period)

47

and has lower mortality to our current understanding [3-5]. The novel betacoronavirus

48

identified through de novo sequencing from patients with COVID-19 is designated as “Severe

49

Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)” by International Committee on

50

Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [1, 6, 7].

51

The recent threats from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are different from

52

those of earlier human coronaviruses (CoVs), including alphacoronaviruses, such as hsa-CoV-

53

229E, hsa-CoV-NL63, hsa-CoV-OC43 and hsa-CoV-HKU1 [8-10], in at least two aspects.

54

First, the recent groups of betacoronaviruses appears to come more frequently in the past two

55

decades as compared to the early comers where new members may be discovered as technology

56

become more efficient and accurate [11]. The current SARS-CoV-2 is also different from both

57

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as its genome composition is most closely for “living with

58

mammals and humans”, where a much lower G+C content has been evolved and is closer to

59

two other human-adapted CoVs, hsa-CoV-229E and hsa-CoV-OC43, than its members of the

60

recent group, although it shares higher sequence identities with the two new CoVs, 80.12%

61

and 60.06%, respectively [11]. Second, it has been infecting far larger populations, as

62

compared to the two recent outbreaks, with variable yet more complex symptoms [12]. The

63

causative factors of such an unprecedented disease potency remain to be elucidated for the days

64

and months to come [1, 3–7].

65

Genomes of coronaviruses mutate in a unique way where signatures of DNA pairing and

66

repairing mechanisms are absent completely, and instead, they possess an error-prone synthesis

67

of single-stranded full or partial genomic sequences by multi-component membrane-associated

68

enzymatic structure known as the replicase-transcriptase complexes (RTCs) and double-

69

membrane vesicles (DMVs) although they do have certain enzymatic activity resembling repair

70

mechanisms of cellular organisms, such as proofreading [13], and other possible cellular

71

mechanisms may also be involved, such as RNA editing as recently proposed [14,15]. Here we

72

define a series of displays to understand compositional dynamics or variability that ultimately

73

interconnects to proteomic variability including RTCs and DMVs (of course also other omics)

74

through the organization of the genetic code [16–19]. We subsequently compare SARS-CoV-

75

2 with other human CoVs for between-population variation analysis to point out that it is not a

76

direct descendant of the previous human-infecting CoVs. We finally make efforts to decipher

77

the SARS-CoV-2 clades for its variations and suggest that what we have seen now are not the

78

natural picture of the pandemics and the missing-links are not among human populations but

79

the wildlife close to human habitats in Southeast Asian territories, including islands and

80

shorelines, not just limited to bats and pangolins. We also show how to examine clade-

81

associated permutation variations and relate genetic variations to protein structures and

82

phenotypic data. Nailing down a single animal of human origin of the virus will not be the

83

goals of this genomics-based study but to provide information for smarter drug design,

84

effective vaccine development, accurate diagnostics.

Results and Discussion

87
88

Compositional dynamics and its parameters are essential and useful features for

89

evaluating the evolutionary status and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 towards

90

pandemics

91
92

RNA genomics is very different from DNA genomics in several ways [11]. First, in the RNA

93

genome, the A:U basepair is actually 2 Daltons heavier than that of the G:C basepair due to a

94

larger molecular weight of uridine, whereas in the DNA genome the GC pair is a single Dalton

95

heavier than that of the A:T basepair. In CoVs, the G+C content is actually in a trend of

96

reducing so that the virus is in turn becoming heavier due to the increased U content [11].

97

Second, single-stranded RNA genomes are synthesized without stable double-stranded

98

intermediates that allow mismatch repair albeit existence of short and extremely rare double-

99

stranded RNA fragments involved in interference-based immunity [20, 21]. Third, the

100

existence of Wobble basepairing for secondary structures is of essence for operational

101

functions of all RNA molecules in addition to genetic information inheritance [22]. That said,

102

we can now look at how the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 and related CoVs take advantage

103

of these RNA-centric features.

104

As a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 has a genome length of ~

105

29903 nucleotides (nt) (GenBank: NC_045512.2). It encodes two large polypeptides, ORF1a

106

and ORF1b, along with other 15 non-structure proteins (nsps; Figure 1A). In order to propagate

107

and complete the life cycle, its positive-sense genome is first replicated to synthesize full-

108

length negative-sense antigenomes and 10 shorter subgenomes (sgRNAs), executed by RTCs

109

and DMVs, and the sgRNAs encode four structural proteins (S, spike; E, envelope; M,

110

membrane; and N, nucleocapsid) and six accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b,

111

ORF8, and ORF10) arranged among structural proteins depending on the current annotation

112

(GenBank: NC_045512.2).

113

Traditionally, we use three basic plots to display composition dynamics based on primary

114

genomic parameters over genome length: G+C contents at three codon positions (GC1, GC2

115

and GC3); purine content (A+G content); and GC skew (the content of (G-C)/(G+C)). Here,

116

we use a 300-nt sliding window with a step size of 21 nt, as the majority of viral sequences are

117

protein-coding, to illustrate the dynamics of the composition parameters, G+C and purine

118

contents (Figure 1B). The G+C content of SARS-CoV-2 varies in a narrow but significant

119

window of 18.00% (31.67%–49.67%) and the purine content in a slightly narrower window of

120

15.50% (41.67%–57.17%) in average over the entire genome length. The GC skew of the

121

SARS-CoV-2 genome indicates the G+C ratio is relatively higher in structural proteins than

122

ORF1ab and this imbalance is a signature of distinct mutational biases caused by viral

123

replication machinery, known as RTCs. It is also variable as a frequent shift toward negative

124

values are often seen in individual ORFs and defined proteins. Such minor anomalies suggest

125

either recombination or selection events, which are species- or isolate-specific. The differences

126

become obvious when SARS-CoV-2 is compared to the closely-related bat and pangolin CoVs

127

(raf-betaCoV-RaTG13 and mja-betaCoV-P4L; Figure S1A and S1B), and the authentic within-

128

species variation is exemplified when SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are matched up with civets

129

and camels in similar parameters, respectively (Figure S1C, S1D, S1E and S1F). The G+C

130

content of different codon positions is also very informative, where GC3 is very characteristic

131

of mutation pressure as it is obvious that all GC3 values of the viral proteins are biased toward

132

lower G+C contents. GC3-associated mutations often reflect directional mutation patterns as

133

observed strongly in certain lineages of plants and warm-blooded vertebrates as negative

134

gradients from the transcription starts, and such trends are attributable to a special DNA repair

135

mechanism, transcription-coupled DNA repair [23–25]. The notion here is to remind ourselves

136

that transcription-centric mutations may be accounted for some of the mutation events in RNA

137

viruses in their replication-transcription processes. Occasional twists from the trend often

138

indicate selective pressures, such as in the case of S, M, and N proteins, and weaker GC3 or

139

stronger GC1 or GC2 selections. Codon-associated G+C content trends are less informative for

140

small ORFs, such as the case of ORF10. Most of the sequence signatures are indicative rather

141

than proven functional relevance of proteins but very useful for providing clues of sequence

142

anomaly.

143

For studying RNA viral genomes, in addition to previously-defined parameters, we need to

144

introduce the concept of single nucleotide (A, U, G and C) contents at three codon positions

145

(such as U1, U2 and U3 for uridines) (Figure 2) and to plot out compositional dynamics for

146

positive-sense or the genome and negative-sense strands, which include both templates for

147

synthesizing new positive-sense genomes or antigenome and subgenomes. All viral mRNAs

148

are transcribed from an antigenome and other 9 subgenomes (Figure 2B). For compositional

149

dynamics of RNA genomes, uridine is the star nucleotide, and A+U content becomes the most

150

important. Just for the sake of convenience, we would like to keep the concept of G+C content

151

since it has been known to be a useful variable for DNA compositional dynamics [26] and

152

provide an approximation for less selected nucleotide position. For both DNA and RNA viruses,

153

this variable G+C content remains similar to their hosts mostly, except those that are not well

154

adapted to their hosts, such as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV (Figure S2A; [11]).

155

As shown in a phylogenetic tree constructed based on 15 representative coronaviruses

156

(Figure 2A), the nucleotide content of SARS-CoV-2 is most similar to those of raf-betaCoV-

157

RaTG13 and mja-betaCoV-P4L, which are considered to be distantly related but most closely

158

related so-far-found host of SARS-CoV-2. Other known zoonotic and corresponding human

159

counterpart CoVs are rather close to each other in their compositions. We have made a few

160

interesting observations here. First, the single nucleotide content is more informative than G+C

161

content, especially for genome analysis on RNA viruses. The former points out only how G+C

162

content drifts toward richness or poorness but the latter narrows it down to single nucleotide

163

effect. In our case, U stands out at cp3, which alters the overall nucleotide contents, and it

164

drives the G+C content so low that even its partner A content has gone to the same extremity,

165

so that the low G+C content is a result of both lowering U and A. If the organization principles

166

are considered here, half of the codons are not sensitive to cp3 changes, and most of them are

167

smaller amino acids (Figure S2B; [16–19]). Second, at the cp1, G and C contents are both

168

pulled apart toward extremity but not A or U, while the two pyrimidines and two purines appear

169

stretched to separate directions; these trends suggest strong selective pressure at the first codon

170

position over the entire genome. It is indeed that cp1 codons shoulder the most mutation

171

pressures since they fall into all 4 negative-sense strand permutations (known as R1-derived

172

permutations, C-to-U, G-to-A, U-to-C and A-to-G). Third, the cp2 contents are most row-

173

flipping changes referenced to the genetic code organization [18]. These alterations are very

174

useful for alternating chemical characteristics between related amino acids, and in terms of

175

flexibility, cp2 codons are less stringent than cp3 but more flexible than cp1. The balancing

176

power becomes more obvious when ORFs or proteins are examined individually for their

177

composition dynamics (Figure 1C). Finally, it is conclusive that the more similar the CoVs in

178

composition dynamic parameters, the closer they are genetically and phylogenetically in

179

principle. However, primary parameters, such as G+C and purine contents are necessary but

180

may not be sufficient. For instance, there has been a CoV genome isolate from a wild vole

181

captured in northeastern China, whose G+C and purine contents overlap with SARS-CoV-2

182

completely (Rodent coronavirus isolate RtMruf-CoV-2/JL2014; 0.38, 0.496; [27]) but its

183

genome sequence is different (sharing 61.87% identity with SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, we have

184

yet to find a within-population immediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 albeit best similarity

185

of composition dynamics seen among them.

186

Our subsequent study is focused on composition dynamics within CoV genomes. It is

187

interesting to see uniformity among all codon position contents of all CoV genomes, increased

188

G+C content from antigenomes to subgenomes. However, this trend is an illusion where the

189

real trend is the lower G+C content of antigenomes but higher G+C contents of subgenomes

190

due to stronger selection over structural proteins. This observation becomes clearer when all

191

ORFs and proteins are scrutinized one by one (Figure 1C and Figures S1). SARS-CoV-2 has

192

an exceptionally short subgenome 9 (sg9) which only contains ORF10, but we have no

193

evidence that it is either functional or non-functional. These results collectively remind us that

194

SARS-CoV-2 and its two most-closely-related CoVs, unlike in the case of many other known

195

CoVs, have a unique genome composition and similar dynamics to the early-adapted human

196

CoVs [11], and CoV-borne bats and other mammals may already coexist with ability to jump

197

on to humans and domestic animals but only limited by environmental and geographic

198

constraints.

200

Mutation spectrum is composed of permutations that are distinct according to their

201

strand specificity, order of synthesis, and ratio of positive-sense vs. negative-sense strands

202

during propagation

203

We use 12 permutations to represent directional mutations and classify them according to

204

strand-specific replication mechanisms (Figure 3) since they are readily related to codons [11]

205

(Figure S2B). From a total of 5,054 point mutations, 1,416, 1,497, and 2,141 mutations fall on

206

codon position 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The permutations are categorized into R1 (C-to-U, G-

207

to-A, U-to-C and A-to-G), R2 (C-to-A, U-to-G, A-to-C and G-to-U), and R12 (C-to-G, U-to-

208

A, A-to-U and G-to-C) derived according to their occurrence tailored to RTC-directed strand

209

synthesis: R1 from the first negative-sense strand, R2 from the subsequent positive-sense

210

strand, and R12 from R1 plus R2. The most abundant permutations are four R1 permutations

211

and one R2 permutation, G-to-U (Figure 3A and 3B). What have we shown here is how

212

sensitive are nucleotide content of cp3 to selective pressure, and most cp3 permutations

213

disappear except the R2 G-to-U permutations at cp3, where all changes are transversions and

214

more than half of all codons (all pro-diversity changes) are sensitive to them. Similar results

215

are observed in our analysis on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure S3A and S3B). There are

216

slightly different patterns among SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and their within-population

217

mammals from the SARS-CoVs and close relatives, the higher U-to-C permutations. The

218

predominate C-to-U represents a driving force of variation, and it manifests why both G+C and

219

A+G contents of SARS-CoV-2 appear relatively lower against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV

220

and even more when compared to human CoVs, such as 229E and OC43 (Figure S2A).

221

Since most cp1 and cp2 related permutations are sensitive to selection, we have examined

222

how individual permutations correlated to codon rearrangements in the two halves tables: pro-

223

diversity and pro-robustness (Figure 3C and 3D) [16, 17]. Only two examples, C-to-U and A-

224

to-G, are shown here and the rest are summarized in Figure S3C. Several observations are

225

worthy of in-depth discussion. First, it is known that three amino acids and their codons are

226

unique in balancing one of two purine-sensitive halves; they are Leu (leucine), Arg (arginine),

227

and Ser (serine) [16–19]. The most abundant amino acid in protein coding sequences (known

228

as codon usage) is Leu and it buffers C-to-U|U-to-C mutations at cp1. Arg and Ser are also

229

abundant as they both are 6-fold degenerate codons; Arg appears buffering A-to-G|G-to-A at

230

cp1 and Ser carries two: U-to-A|A-to-U at cp1 and G-to-C|C-to-G at cp2. Second, amino acid

231

exchanges are permissive in physiochemical properties [23–25]. For instance, Ser has a very

232

similar size to Ala (alanine) so that G+C content increase is buffered by the two amino acids

233

as G-to-U|U-to-G permutations. Third, other examples are codon alterations among

234

hydrophobic amino acids as they are mostly C-to-U changes at cp2 among those in the pro-

235

robustness half. The overall effects are displayed together in Figure 3D. It is rather clear that

236

changes toward lower G+C content and near the balanced purine content are both beneficial

237

for CoVs, especially SARS-CoV-2, as these changes are pro-diversity, in favor of larger and

238

more hydrophilic amino acids.

239
240

Clade-associated biased mutation trend in SARS-CoV-2 revealed physiochemical

241

features of replication machinery

242

Difficulties for analyzing CoV genomes are multifold. Since we have yet to identify the natural

243

hosts and mammalian intermediate hosts, if there is any, this massive dataset has to be analyzed

244

by stratifying the data into structured and non-structured clades; the former can be analyzed

245

first and the rest await further ideas. The next is even more troublesome. Assuming that we

246

have 5 or more genome sequences per CoV isolate and variations identified among them are

247

still a miniscule fraction of the total virions produced in a patient body (medians and means of

248

variations per CoV isolate among C01 to C09, see Table S3), since the viral load per patient

249

sample, such as sputum [28, 29], is equivalent to a 5-person or more sampling of the entire

250

human population on earth, 1 out of 109. Even so, we have still been able to find shared

251

variations among patient samples occasionally and even more lucky to have some clade

252

structures, by and large due to the relatedness of the patients in the transmission network.

253

Finally, we have to admit that many assumptions have to be made about these samples and

254

their genome sequences above sequence and assembly errors for phylogeny and genetic studies.

255

Nevertheless, we have constructed a somewhat stable phylogenetic tree-and-branch

256

structure for further analysis (Figure 4A). It is composed of 8 monophyletic clades and 1 non-

257

monophyletic clade based on both orders of sample collection date and highly-shared mutations.

258

Among the clades, C02 shares two landmark mutations, C8782U in ORF1ab and U28144C in

259

ORF8, and earlier date (2019/12/30). C04 shares three more mutations (C17747U, A17858G,

260

and C18060U in ORF1ab) than what C02 have, and a late collection date (2020/02/20). Clades

261

C03, C05, and C07 are also distinguishable by some major mutations, so are C06, C08, and

262

C09; the latter clades are clustered together based on four shared and other clade-associated

263

mutations. The leftover large number of isolates that lack all landmark mutations are grouped

264

into C01, which have the earliest collection date on 2019/12/24. According to the literature and

265

our discussion, we have further grouped the clades into three clusters, S (C02 and C04), G

266

(C06, C08 and C09), and L (all the rest) since phylogeny shows clear divergence among them.

267

We have several notions about this imperfect hierarchical structure. First, our within- and

268

between-clade analysis of high major allele frequency (MAF) variations reveals that some

269

clade-associated signature mutations are also shared among clades. For instance, C14805U in

270

ORF1ab and A24034G in Cluster S have recurred in other clades of different clusters, which

271

are excellent landmarks for subclade definition. Another notion is that higher MAF within-

272

clade mutations (such as MAF>0.2) are mostly non-synonymous mutations, indicating

273

selection at work (Figure S4). Our neighbor-joining tree based on distances from 9 clades

274

suggests that SARS-CoV-2 appears originated from multiple zoonotic reservoirs instead of a

275

single direct ancestor (Figure S4). In addition, our classification rationales are largely in

276

agreement with published reports [30]; for example, Cluster S is in accordance with previously

277

defined S type [31] and Cluster G is in line with GISAID [32] defined the G clade. Cluster L

278

is similar to the V and L clades combined, of GISAID. A maximum likelihood (ML) based

279

unrooted phylogenetic tree is shown in Figure 4B.

280

To look for clade-associated compositional and functional features, we have first built a

281

consensus sequence for each clade and subsequently calculated frequencies for each within-

282

clade permutation (Table S2; Figure 5A and 5B). A key assumption behind this is that certain

283

functional mutations may have clade-specific effects on mutation spectrum, to close a loop

284

where sequence mutations through genetic coding principles alter the viral proteome function.

285

Our observations are of importance in establishing logics about compositional dynamics

286

between nucleic acids and proteins. First, permutations among clades are indeed variable

287

according to their proportions calculated from genome variants, and aside from 5 high-

288

proportion permutations, 4 R1 and 1 R2 permutations, two other R2 and one R12 permutations

289

appear also joining in, which are U-to-G and A-to-C, as well as A-to-U, respectively. Second,

290

the variable permutations, where some may represent effect of mutation pressure and others

291

may exaggerate selection pressure, are unique to clades and clade clusters. For instance, clade

292

cluster S has the lowest G-to-U fraction as compared to those of L and G; in addition, among

293

the S clades, C04 has the lowest value of G-to-U. Similarly, C03, C05, C06, C08, and C09

294

have relatively higher G-to-U permutations. Third, based on the disparity of permutations or

295

simply mutation spectra, we have taken a rather radical step to assume RTC statuses in favor

296

of either tight or loose statuses for binding to purines and pyrimidines (see Figure S5). Since

297

purines are larger than pyrimidines in size, the purine- or R-tight must be different from

298

pyrimidine- or Y-tight. The results are strikingly predictable in that the R-tight status suggests

299

a tighter binding pocket where a descending trend for tight permutations (C-to-U, G-to-U, and

300

U-to-A) reverses into the opposite trend for Y-tight permutations. It indicates that the RTC

301

structure and conformation variables may be definable in principle. At this point, we do not

302

have discrete definitions for these so-called tight statuses but the less trendy R-loose and Y-

303

loose statuses also support a similar idea.

304

We have further examined the compositional subtleties among the clades and clusters with

305

a focus on G+C and purine content variability as both contents appear drifting toward optima

306

in SARS-CoV-2 and its relatives (Figure 5C and 5D). Different clades exhibit distinct

307

compositional features and such dynamics are very indicative for the existence of feedback

308

loops connecting RNA variables to protein variables. Two directions have to be advised for

309

understanding these features albeit in absence of between-clade statistics. The first direction is

310

driven by strong mutations, perhaps coupled to tight-loose switches in the catalytic pocket of

311

RdRPs in RTCs. It is clear that except C01, the G or C06-C08-C09 cluster has the lowest G+C

312

(0.37929, based on a C08 CoV sampled in Australia) and the lowest purine contents (0.49527,

313

based on a C08 CoV collected in Bangladesh and a C09 CoV collected in England). Both lower

314

G+C and purine contents are indicative of mutation pressure and signal this fast-evolving

315

cluster of CoVs. Since this cluster has the largest collection of CoVs, it is also not surprising

316

to see a more complex median diversification within clades (Figure 5C and 5D). The second

317

direction is the drive from selection or both selection and mutation in balance or imbalance, as

318

well as in modes of fine-tuning or quick-escaping. Some results from our analyses are shown

319

here for briefing purposes (Figure 5E to 5G). For instance, G+C and purine contents at cp3 are

320

informative for mutation drives and other measures are less clear cut (Figure 5F), given the

321

evidence that even MAFs among clades are not stably distributed among clades as lower MAF

322

variations are rather sporadic and hard to analyze even binned into groups (data not shown).

323

Based on our clade and clade cluster analysis, it is tempting for us to speculate that there

324

are plenty of rooms for further investigations into mutation spectra among large clades and

325

even smaller clades or closely related individual CoV genomes for several reasons. First, all

326

high-frequency MAFs should be identified and classified and these variations are candidates

327

for highly selected mutations. Second, all within-clade minor but not rare alleles (less than

328

1/10,000), such as those of MAFs in a range of 0.01% to 10% should also be identified; they

329

provide basis of within-clade sequence analysis. Third, all non-structured CoV genomes must

330

be also classified based on shared variations, as they are not only valuable for within-clade but

331

also for clade-cluster analyses since there is a large background of genome variations not yet

332

brought into the databases.

Within-clade variations and their implications for future SARS-CoV surveillance

335

Within-clade compositional dynamics can also be very informative, especially for covering

336

and predicting future functional changes, such as identifying mutated and diversified forms of

337

CoVs for drug and vaccine designs. It is also of essence for nucleic acid-based diagnostics,

338

such as clade-specific identifications. We are in a process of developing an interactive database

339

and mutation-function predicting algorithms based on our results to interpret novel sequence

340

variations in real time. Within-population variations are identified based on clade consensus

341

sequence after alignment and extracted from datasets that have hundreds and thousands of

342

genome sequences. The analysis of within-population variations relies on structured phylogeny

343

and proportion change of permutations. The changes, based on functional relevance, can be

344

classified into either copy number-related or RTC-specificity related, or sometimes both.

345

We have taken two steps to extract information in order to distinguish the underlining

346

mechanisms (Figure 6). In the first approach, we identify key mutations based on MAF of

347

mutations with a consideration of relatively even distribution among subclades and name the

348

subclades in a sequential order based on the absence of a subset (Figure 6A). In the second step,

349

we plot out permutations to track changes among subclades (Figure 6B). For instance, clade

350

C02 can be divided into 8 subclades and its variable permutation fractions are clearly

351

recognizable. An immediate discovery is the trends of descending C-to-U, ascending A-to-G,

352

and wavy G-to-U that initially goes up with A-to-G but rides down with C-to-U afterward.

353

Taking the two smaller clades, such as C03 and C05, as examples (Figure 6D and 6E), we

354

first find that their trends of permutation variables show opposite directions, where the

355

increasing C-to-U accompanies with the decreasing G-to-U. A closer examination reveals that

356

the increasing C-to-U in C03 is also accompanied by descending U-to-C. The only permutation

357

showing an increasing trend in C03 is G-to-A. The take-home message from these trends is

358

that RNA synthesis of this subclade is biased toward producing more negative-sense strands

359

or its mutation spectrum exhibits increasing mutations generated during the negative-sense

360

strand synthesis. Such analysis can be carried out continuously when more CoV genome data

361

become available as other within-clade variations are not as informative as C03 vs. C05 (Figure

362

S6).

363

Several precautions are worth noting in such analysis. The most noticeable weakness is the

364

fact that we assume function-related mutations are discovered in our dataset. As we have

365

proposed an analogy before, chances are slim, dozens out of millions or even billions.

366

Furthermore, even if we see drastic changes in permutations and mutation spectra, the

367

mutations we identified still need validation empirically and based on different data types or

368

sources albeit rare and precious. Finally, most frequently encountered situations are those that

369

multiple mutations exhibit cofounding effects for a phenotypically identified functional or

370

structural feature, and undoubtedly, more and deep-sequencing data are still invaluable and

371

irreplaceable.

373

Conclusion

374

This COVID-19 pandemic provides once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the fields of

375

biomedicine and other life sciences to work together on it as many facets as possible albeit

376

exchanging with lives and other massive losses. If lessons told, we had learned things in serious

377

ways in the last two CoV epidemics and we did prepare ourselves with vaccines and medication

378

since, we would not have suffered this much this time. If one assumes that the last two

379

outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV came surely by chances, this time SARS-CoV-2 is

380

here for real, and a worst-case scenario is that it may stay with us forever or until effective

381

vaccination is developed. Nevertheless, it certainly will stay with us for quite a while for many

382

reasons [11]. First, at least it and other within-population versions of coronaviruses will

383

definitely come again because we have not been able to trace its origin and ways its

384

transmission from the very beginning, neither the Wuhan outbreak nor the recent Beijing

385

outbreak in China even guided with very strict quarantine roles and prompt action plans. Next,

386

this particular virus, SARS-CoV-2, has evolved to a composition status where some of its

387

natural yet genetically distant hosts or possible intermediate mammalian hosts have acquired

388

similar status [33, 34]. Furthermore, we do not yet have enough data to really map out the

389

phylogenetic position that allows us to pinpoint its natural origin and human transmission

390

routes.

391

The number one needs for us is data, genomic and clinical data, which should be as

392

complete as possible and with characteristics including high-quality and high-coverage at

393

single-molecule resolution. We currently have been acquiring genomic data and the specialized

394

databases have collections over ten thousand non-redundant sequence variations, but still not

395

enough to address more than a few possible functional changes of some key protein

396

components [35–38], let alone understanding mutation-centric cellular mechanisms. Based on

397

median and mean estimates, we have on average a mutation accumulation rate of half a dozen

398

per patient. Although there have been data reported from single-molecule sequencing platform

399

but they are low in coverage [39].

400

Our final notion is to emphasize the importance of analysis strategies and supporting

401

platforms. Since questions always overwhelm what we can possibly address [40], prioritizing

12

402

tasks are of essence together with choices of strategies. The first platform to be established

403

concerns mutation-to-function interpretation, where we have present one in this report. Another

404

to be considered is mathematic modeling, such as cellular and disease transmissions [41–46]

405

and viral mutation-selection paradigm, for testing and evaluating different parameters and

406

prioritizing what kind of data to be acquired with high priorities. In addition, cellular and

407

molecular data, including different omics studies [47], all need to be incorporated into a

408

COVID-19 knowledgebase, where information from multi-disciplinary studies are managed,

409

organized, and mined.

410
411

Materials and Methods

412

SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses sequences

413

We used the public-available SARS-CoV-2 data collected worldwide among the major

414

databases, including CNCB/NGDC [48], CNGBdb [49], GISAID [32], GenBank [50] and

415

NMDC [51] on June 12th, 2020. To ensure authenticity and reliability, our datasets must meet

416

the following criteria: (1) The genome sequence is labeled as complete that covers all coding

417

regions of the reference genome (GenBank accession NC_045512.2). (2) It has no more than

418

15 uncertain bases that often substituted as “N”s. (3) It has no more than 50 degenerate bases

419

that often labeled as discrete nucleotides. These high-quality genomes were aligned to the

420

reference using MUSCLE (version 3.8.31) with default parameter settings [52]. Further

421

analyses of SARS-CoV-2 and related CoV genomes are referenced to genome annotation of

422

the same reference genome (NC_045512.2) and other information provided by the RefSeq

423

database at NCBI.

424

Other closely related CoV genome sequences used include hsa-betaCoV-HKU1, hsa-

425

betaCoV-OC43, ave-gamaCoV, mga-gamaCoV, smu-alphaCoV-WS, hsa-alphaCoV-229E,

426

hsa-alphaCoV-NL63, taf-alphaCoV-NL63, MERS-CoV (from human and camel hosts), cdr-

427

betaCoV-B73, SARS-CoV (from human and civet hosts), pla-betaCoV-SZ3 and raf-betaCoV-

428

RaTG13 are retrieved from NCBI and mja-betaCoV-P4L are retrieved from NGDC. A full

429

listing of our sequences dataset including virus genre, strain name, accession number and

430

sources is provided in Table S3.

Calculation of genomic composition parameters

433

We display several genomic composition dynamics and its parameters (G+C content, A+G

434

content and GC skew) using different sliding windows. The first 300 nt are grouped as an initial

435

window, and subsequent windows are uniformly shifted in a 21-nt step. Within these displays,

436

the G+C contents referenced to the three codon positions of each open reading frame or ORF

437

are measured by adjusting the sliding window according to the ORF lengths within viral

438

genomes. As for ORFs longer than 2000 nt, a relatively large window size (300 nt) is adopted,

439

and the step size is calculated via a custom formula 𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 &

440

where 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎABC denotes the length of ORF and 𝑣𝑏 varied from zero to two bases to make

441

sure the window size is divisible by 3; for ORFs with a medium size (longer than 500 bases

442

and shorter than 2000 nt), the window size is defined as 𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 &E ∗ 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎABC 4 − 𝑣𝑏, 0 ≤

443

𝑣𝑏 ≤ 2, while the step size is simply defined as 3 nt; as for those small ORFs (shorter than 500

444

nt) such as structural proteins, a constant 21-nt window size and 3-nt step size is used for

445

calculating genomic composition frequency.

446

The criteria for choosing the representative CoV genome sequences for constructing a

447

representative phylogenetic tree (Figure 2) are multi-fold. First, we include all 7 human-

448

infecting coronaviruses for the analysis, which are SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV,

449

hsa-alphaCoV-229E, hsa-betaCoV-OC43, hsa-betaCoV-HKU1, and hsa-alphaCoV-NL63 (a

450

prefix hsa- standing for Homo sapiens was used to label the unfamiliar human-infecting CoVs).

451

Second, we categorized all human-infecting, for simplicity, into 4 lineages: SARS-CoV-2,

452

SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the older human CoV lineages. Therefore, their related CoVs in

453

the literature were also selected for the analysis, including a single closely-related CoVs for

454

each lineage (based on sequence identity): SARS-CoV-related (pla-betaCoV-SZ3), MERS-

455

CoV-related (cdr-betaCoV-B73), SARS-CoV-2 related (raf-betaCoV-RaTG13), and NL63-

456

related (taf-alphaCoV-NL63; both species and CoV genera were labelled for clarity). Third,

457

we also added more informative CoV genome sequences to enrich lineage-associated

458

information, which are a pangolin coronavirus genome (mja-betaCoV-P4L) reported to be

459

closed to SARS-CoV-2 and 3 non-beta-coronaviruses that infect animals (e.g., ave-gamaCoV

460

from gamma-coronavirus genus and smu-alphaCoV-WS from alpha-coronavirus genus).

461

Fourth, we only used complete protein-coding sequences from the CoVs to construct the

462

phylogenetic tree and to calculate genome parameter contents. The sequences were aligned by

463

using MUSCLE and the UPGMA tree was constructed by using MEGA-X [53]. The G+C

464

content and single nucleotide content of each virus genome at three codon positions was also

465

calculated. Subgenomes of SARS-CoV was obtained from Marra et al [54], and we annotated

466

the subgenomes of SARS-CoV-2, mja-betaCoV-P4L, and raf-betaCoV-RaTG13 based on the

467

annotation of NCBI (GenBank accession NC_045512.2). In addition, G+C and single

468

nucleotide contents of the complete genome and its subgenomes of these four viruses at three

469

codon positions were displayed to serve as sequence composition references.

470
471

Variation calling and categorization

472

All sequence variations are identified and categorized based on comparisons between the query

473

and the reference genomes, and files were generated by using an in-hoc Perl scripts based on

474

alignment results. The tailored annotation (gene, location and consequence on the protein

475

sequence) of each variant is determined with VEP (version 99.0) [55]. Since a large number of

476

gaps and low-quality sequences at the 3’ and 5’ ends, variations (substitutions, insertions and

477

deletions or indels) occurring 50 nt each at 5’- and 3’-ends of the genome are not considered.

478

Since the higher quartile of variations per genome among SARS-CoV-2 populations is 9

479

(based on the 22,051 sequences we analyzed in this study), we filtered out the problematic sites

480

that exceed 50 variations as compared to the reference genome. CoV genome sequences have

481

at least one mutation are used in this study. A full listing of variations among coding regions

482

identified in this study is provided in Table S4.

483

All continuously updated mutation files of the SARS-CoV-2 populations in variant call

484

format (version 4.2) are deposited at the variation page of the 2019nCoVR database contributed

485

by CNCB/NGDC (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/variation/).

486
487

Mutation spectrum analysis

488

A mutation spectrum for within-population variations is composed of two lines of information;

489

one concerns mutations that are referenced to a population consensus built based on the entire

490

collection, and the other contains frequencies of all mutations and their directional changes,

491

i.e., permutations. To reduce pitfalls of sequencing errors, we only selected mutations that

492

occur more than twice in the whole collection of SARS-CoV-2 populations (clades or clade

493

clusters that are often defined based on phylogenetic analysis). In theory, there are 16 possible

494

permutations but 4 of them are unrecognizable so that 12 permutations (C-to-U, A-to-G, U-to-

495

C, G-to-A, G-to-U, U-to-G, A-to-C, C-to-A, U-to-A, G-to-C, C-to-G and A-to-U) are there as

496

an informative set. When the number of CoV genomes collected are limited, such as SARS-

497

CoVs and MERS-CoVs, entire data sets are pooled together without clades. In our analyses on

498

SARS-CoVs and MERS-CoVs (Figure S3A), we aligned sequences from these two lineages to

499

their reference genomes (SARS-CoV: NC_004718.3; MERS-CoV: NC_019843.3) to call

500

variations. When aligned on overlapping sequences, due to large deletions and additional ORFs,

501

are encountered, we always choose the largest or only one of the ORFs to represent the segment,

502

respectively. For example, in SARS-CoV lineage, if a mutation falls into the overlapping

503

region of ORF9a (encoding the N protein) and ORF9b, we have only used the ORF9a

504

annotations to avoid redundancy.

505
506

Phylogeny constructing

507

Given the scale of SARS-CoV-2 sequence collections, we focused on genomes with unique

508

information contributing to phylogenetic analysis. First, mutations (including single-nucleotide

509

substitution and indels) at frequencies equal or greater than 10 in between-clade or –population

510

calls were selected. FastTree (version 2.1.11) [56] is used to construct maximum likelihood

511

phylogeny based on 5,121 genomes that have met our criteria, and iTol [57], an interactive web

512

server was employed for setting an unrooted format and annotating samples.

513

For Figure S4, the neighbor-joining method is used for constructing phylogeny from the

514

Euclidean distance of the mutation frequency matrix of clades, and the tree was generated and

515

visualized by R package phangorn [58] and ggtree [59].

516
517

Estimation of G+C and purine contents of genome sequences

518

G+C and purine (or A+G) contents of CoVs in general vary in a narrow range, and therefore,

519

subtleties among the content changes have to be scrutinized with low-quality sequences

520

excluded. A more sensitive approach is used in this study where two points are assumed; all

521

genomes are full-length and variant alleles in coding sequences are the varied composition.

522

The absolute frequencies of A+G and G+C content are defined as:

523

5492 + 5863 + S𝐺T'+ − 𝐺U(V W + S𝐶T'+ − 𝐶U(V W

and

𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑐 𝐺𝐶 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡 =

528

where 8,954, 5,492, 5,863, and 29,903 are the frequencies of A, G, C and total length of the

529

SARS-CoV-2 reference, respectively. For any sequence compared with the reference, the

530

𝐷𝑒𝑙T'+ and 𝐼𝑛𝑠T'+ measures the deleted and inserted nucleotides of this sequence, respectively,

531

535

G. Similarly, S𝐺T'+ − 𝐺U(V W + S𝐶T'+ − 𝐶U(V W in Equation (2) represents the varied number of G

Clade subgrouping

539

To detect trend followers and disrupters in mutation spectra, a pipeline was developed to select

540

such genomes and mutations within clades iteratively. The first step includes locating high-

541

frequency mutations (major alleles, MA) in a clade and extracting all genomes without this

542

MA mutation to form a subset of the clade. The second step is, within the new subclade, to

543

iterate the process until such mutations are thoroughly identified and no more mutations exceed

544

a manually set threshold of MAF. Since the number of unique variations among clades have

545

been varying significantly over time, the thresholds are 0.05 in C01, C04, C06, C08 and C09;

546

0.1 in C02, C03, C05 and C07. The proportion of permutations in each subclade and the located

547

gene and mutation type (synonymous or non-synonymous) of mutations are provided in Table

548

S5.

730

different shapes: purines, triangles; pyrimidines, open circles. A and U or G and C are colored

733

have very similar codon G+C content as well as base contents. The cp1 (codon position 1) base

relatives. The cp2 (codon position 2) base content of SARS-CoV-2 and all other CoVs has

736

higher and relatively balanced A+U content. The older human CoVs have either lowest or

737

higher G+C content and unbalanced purine contents. Note that G+C contents in three codon

738

positions are labeled differently from those of single nucleotide contents in color codes. G+C

739

content represents a single measure but single nucleotide contents demonstrate trends of all

740

four nucleotides. B. The G+C and single nucleotide contents at different codon positions of

complete genomes and subgenomes of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, mja-betaCoV-P4L, and raf-

betaCoV-RaTG13 are displayed to illustrate the driving force for G+C content decrease toward

743

3’ end of the genome, which is rather a result of, in terms of mechanism, the increased U

744

content and C-to-U permutation. The negative gradient of U is also obvious from the 5’ end to

745

the 3’ end.

746

Figure 3 Mutation spectra of SARS-CoV-2 in a context of G+C contents and codon

747

positions

748

A. The SARS-CoV-2 mutation spectrum is composed of 12 permutations and they are divided

749

by codon positions among all mutations. C-to-U (CU), U-to-C (UC), A-to-G (AG), G-to-A

750

(GA), and G-to-U (GU), are always dominant due to two principles; one is that the first four

751

permutations occur when positive-sense genome is synthesized, and the other is that a G-by-A

752

replacement is always preferred by RTCs so that G-to-U permutation as the most dominant

753

occurring when the antigenome serves as a template. B. C-to-U permutations at cp3 diminish

754

among non-synonymous mutations and this phenomenon indicates that most protein

755

composition relevant variations are cp1 and cp2 variations. The remaining non-synonymous

756

mutations in G-to-U (GU) permutation may be a result of biased strand synthesis. C. Displays

757

of permutation-to-codon changes among non-synonymous mutations. The codon table is

758

divided into two halves: the pro-diversity half (blue) whose cp3 is sensitive to transitional

759

change and the pro-robust half (purple) whose cp3 position is insensitive to any change. Two

760

examples, C-to-U (1051 in counts) and A-to-G (314 in counts) permutations are shown here.

761

When a codon has a C-to-U change, the codon position varies, results of such changes relative

762

to codon positions are summarized on both sides of the codon flow chart. Note that cp1 and

763

cp2 changes appear more than those of cp3. The ratio between codons of pro-robust half and

764

pro-diversity half is displayed on each bar. D. All permutations are plotted against the reference

765

genome sequence to show how changes are related to amino acids. In the molecular weight

766

index, most cp1 and cp2 changes are most obvious, showing an increasing trend. In the

767

hydrophobicity index, most cp1 and cp2 changes increase toward less hydrophobicity.

parentheses) are labeled with positions and nucleotide variations that are all referenced to the

773

SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC_045512.2), its positions, and relative frequencies (thin vertical

774

bars). The dates when each clade started are also indicated. B. The current collection shows 9

775

clades (C01 to C09) in three clusters (S, L and G). An unrooted phylogenic tree of the clades

776

and clusters (color-coded), the tree scale is 0.01.

Figure 5 Mutation spectrum and composition dynamics among 9 SARS-CoV-2 clades

778

A. Plots showing permutation variation of each clade. Aside from the 5 dominant permutations,

779

A-to-C (R2 permutation), U-to-G (R2 permutation) and A-to-U (R12 permutation) changes

780

appear also significant; such an increase in proportion of R2 and R12 permutations often

781

indicates copy number (synthesis) bias between the two strands. B. When permutations are

782

grouped based on structure-conformation model (Figure S5) into tight and loose groups (a four-

783

parameter model), their trends of changes become obvious. The R-tight discourages A-by-G

784

replacement but encourages C-by-U replacement when the genome is replicated. The loose

785

statuses, regardless R-loose or Y-loose, place no pressure on permutation variability. C. Violin

786

plots showing the G+C content among clades. D. Violin plots showing the purine content

787

among the clades. C08 and C09 have been drifting both contents toward lower ends. C03 has

788

also been drifting in a greater extent of its purine content and a lesser extent of its G+C content,

789

comparatively. E. The mean (solid circles) and median (solid triangles) of G+C and purine

790

contents among clades. The same three more expressive clades, as seen in (C) and (D), are

791

indeed obvious (inset). F. The compositional dynamics of cp3 nucleotides that are less selected

792

and with a stringent cutoff value (> or =5). G. Composition distributions based on major alleles,

793

at frequencies equal or greater than 0.01 to emphasize the effect from selection. H.

Composition distributions based on major alleles at frequencies equal or greater than 0.05. I.

798

A. An example of permutation shifting of clade C02 and among its subclades. The number of

799

SARS-CoV-2 genomes is indicated in the parentheses. The clear trends are two-fold. First,

800

decreased C-to-U permutation is coupled with increased A-to-G and decreased G-to-U

801

permutations. Second, A-to-U permutation is also increased as expected based on the model

802

shown in Figure S5. These trends pf permutation changes suggest irrelevant to the ratio of

Supplementary Figure S1 A display of genome compositional dynamics of SARS-CoV,

811

MERS-CoV and their within-population CoVs

812

We use a 300-bp sliding window with a 21-bp step to show dynamic changes of genome G+C,

813

purine, GC1 to GC3, and GC skew (G-C/G+C) contents. The complete genome sequences and

814

data sources are listed in Table S1.

815

Supplementary Figure S2

816

A. G+C and purine content plot to show how these contents distribute among human CoVs.

817

Note that all older human CoVs are drifted toward lower G+C and purine contents, and this

818

phenomenon indicates lower selection pressure or insensitivity on composition changes. Full

819

names of the human CoVs are listed in the legend of Figure 2. B. A genetic code table to show

820

how nucleotide permutations are related to codons. The table is divided into two halves

821

(colored and uncolored backgrounds) and cp1 and cp2 relative to their permutations sensitivity

822

and changes are indicated with half parentheses with color-coding: C-to-U|U-to-C and A-to-

823

G|G-to-A, red; G-to-U|U-to-G and A-to-C and C-to-U, blue; and A-to-U|U-to-A and G-to-C|C-

824

to-G, green. Note that cp1 and cp2 are sensitive to column and row codon swaps, respectively.

825

Cp3 is in a unique position where only half of the codons are sensitive to its changes, and the

826

other half is so organized that some codons are more permissive than others.

Supplementary Figure S3 Mutation spectra of SARS-CoV-2 in a context of codon

828

positions

829

A. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV mutation spectra are composed of 12 permutations and they

830

are divided by codon positions. C-to-U (CU) permutations are always as dominant as what

831

SARS-CoV-2 shows. The mutation counts are partitioned into synonymous and non-

832

synonymous mutations. B. C-to-U permutations at cp3 diminish among non-synonymous

833

mutations and this phenomenon indicates that most protein composition relevant variations are

834

cp1 and cp2 variations. Note that all older human CoVs are drifted toward lower G+C and

835

purine contents, and this phenomenon indicates lower selection or insensitivity on composition

843

Supplementary Figure S5

844

This table illustrates how 12 permutations are related to G+C and purine contents and the subtle

845

RTC specificity of CoVs. Mutations occur when the positive-sense RNA genome (R1,

846

mutation happens when the negative-sense genome is synthesized) or its negative-sense

847

subgenomes are synthesized (R2). The G+C content insensitive permutations occur after two

848

syntheses (R12). CU and A-to-G (AG) are preferred when RTC is in a status that encourages

849

a large-to-small substrate exchange in a higher ratio than the opposite, small-to-large substrate

850

exchange. We term this preferred exchange as “tight” status. This status is also divided into R-

851

tight (R, purine; to indicate that the mechanism is an A-by-G replacement) and Y-tight (Y,

852

pyrimidine; to indicate that the mechanism is a C-by-U replacement). When an exchange of

853

substrate happens from small-to-large, it is referred as a “loose” status that is also divided into

854

two, R-loose and Y-loose. Note that some permutations are not sensitive to G+C and purine

855

contents but others are sensitive. Arrow-headed dashed lines connect R1 permutation to R12

856

permutations, and note that cross-column relationship is rather striking, which re-routes some

857

structural principles, which navigates mutation forces on one hand and leaves room for

858

selection to work on, on the other hand.
