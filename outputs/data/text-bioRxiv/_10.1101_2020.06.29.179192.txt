ABSTRACT

21

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes

22

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread rapidly around the globe since it was first

23

identified in December of 2019 in Wuhan, China. In a race to contain the infection, researchers

24

and healthcare officials have developed several assays to help diagnose individuals with

25

COVID-19. To help laboratories in deciding what assay to bring into testing lines, factors such

26

as assay availability, cost, throughput, and TAT should be considered. Here we validated a

27

modified version of the CDC assay and used it as a reference to evaluate the performance of

28

the NeuMoDxTM SARS-CoV-2 and DiaSorin SimplexaTM Covid-19 Direct assays. In silico

29

analysis and clinical sample testing showed that the primesr/probes designed by the CDC were

30

specific to the SARS-CoV-2 as they accurately detected all reactive samples with an assay LoD

31

of 200 copies/ml. The performance of the three assays were analyzed using 161

32

nasopharyngeal swabs specimen tested within 24 hours or 5 days from routine testing. A 100%

33

agreement was observed between the commercial assays and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2

34

assay. A deeper look at the Ct values showed no significant difference between NeuMoDx and

35

the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, whereas DiaSorin had lower overall Ct values than the

36

modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. NeuMoDx and DiaSorin workflows were much easier to

37

perform. NeuMoDx has the highest throughput and shortest TAT, whereas although the

38

modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay has comparable throughput to DiaSorin, it has the longest

39

hands-on time, and highest TAT.

INTRODUCTION

44

Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped positive-RNA viruses that infect vertebrates

45

and can widely spread among human causing diseases in the respiratory, intestinal, liver and

46

nervous systems (1). Some coronaviruses, namely human coronaviruses OC43, 229E, NL63

47

and HKU1, have been recognized as the etiological agents of common cold. However, others

48

have been associated with severe respiratory illness and outbreaks: Severe acute respiratory

49

syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) resulted in global outbreak in 2002, the Middle East

50

Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) appeared in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 of 2019 pandemic (2-

51

5) . SARS and MERS are closely-related coronaviruses of about 30 kb genome and members of

52

the beta coronavirus clade (5); like MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have been

53

originated from bats. Symptoms associated with COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-

54

2, vary from mild to severe illness depending on the individual’s underlying medical conditions.

57

SARS-CoV-2, which started in Wuhan City in China at the end of December 2019, has

58

spread to over 188 countries and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health

59

Organization (WHO) on March 11th (6). As of June 26, 2020, there were more than 9,680,000

60

confirmed

61

(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). The United States lead the world with over 2,446,000

62

cases of COVID-19 and over 125,000 deaths as of June 26, 2020. The rate of new cases is

63

increasing in the United States, and in countries such as Mexico and Brazil with no apparent

64

end in sight. In addition to the health crisis caused by this pandemic, the economic impact is

65

equally devastated with the world facing the worst recession since the Great Depression of the

66

1930s. Currently, except for Remdesivir which has been authorized by the Food and Drug

Administration (FDA) for emergency use in the USA for Covid-19 treatment, there is no other

70

There has been a race against time to develop tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection so

71

individuals with COVID-19 could be identified and isolated to slow the spread of the disease. In

72

January 2020, the CDC developed a TaqMan probe based molecular test, and at the end of

73

February of the same year, the FDA provided guidance for validation of laboratory develop

74

tests (LDTs) and submission for Emergency Used Authorization of such tests (7). In the

75

following month, several commercially available assays became available and have been used

76

in the laboratory under the FDA’s EUA (8-12). With the rapid development of those tests, came

77

the challenge of assay sensitivity and specificity. The molecular assays for detection of SARS-

78

CoV-2 are based on reverse transcriptase polymerization chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the

79

open reading frame (ORF1ab), RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and genes that

80

encode structural proteins such as nuclear capsid (N), spike (S), envelop (E), and membrane

81

(M) (7, 13, 14). It has been reported that the CDC N2 and WHO E-gene primer/probe sets are

82

among the most sensitive primer/probe sets for SARS-CoV-2 detection (15).

83

Our laboratory at Tampa General Hospital validated a modified version of the CDC

84

assay following the FDA EUA guidelines and brought in commercial assays under the FDA EUA

85

to help respond to the testing demand in our hospital. All three assays are based on real-time

86

RT-PCR to detect the viral RNA. The modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay involves an off-

87

instrument cell lysis step, a nucleic acid extraction step and an amplification step on a different

88

instrument. The assay includes a panel of two primer/probe sets targeting the viral N gene. The

89

NeuMoDxTM SARS-CoV-2 assay and DiaSorin SimplexaTM Covid-19 Direct assays are

90

automated sample-to-answer assays. They are both multiplex assays targeting two different

91

regions of the viral genome. NeuMoDx targets the Nsp2 and the N genes while DiaSorin targets

92

the ORF1ab and S gene. In this study, we sought to describe the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2

93

assay and compare its performance and workflow to that of the NeuMoDxTM SARS-CoV-2 and

94

DiaSorin SimplexaTM Covid-19 Direct assays.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

99

Primers and probes. The primer/probe sets which were designed and described in the

100

CDC protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 were used in this study (Table 1) (16). N1 and

101

N2 amplified regions of the nucleocapsid gene of the virus. An additional primer/probe set to

102

detect the human ribonuclease (RNase) P gene (RP) in clinical specimens was also included in

103

the panel. An in silico analysis of the primer and probe sequences was conducted based on the

104

currently available sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)

105

database as of March 11, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA (strain USA_WA1/2020), 2019-

106

nCoV_N_Positive Control and Hs_RPP30_Positive Control plasmids were included in the study

107

as templates and external controls. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was kindly provided by the University of

108

Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston while the plasmids and primer/probe sets were

109

acquired from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) (Coralville, USA).

110

Specimen enrollment. Residual respiratory specimens submitted for Covid-19 testing

111

at Tampa General Hospital (TGH) Esoteric Testing Laboratory were used in this study according

112

to the standard procedures and in compliance with the TGH Institutional Review Board (IRB)

113

protocols. Those specimens included sputum, nasopharyngeal (NP) or nasal swabs in Copan

114

Universal Transport Media (UTM) (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) or BD Universal Viral

115

Transport (UVT) system (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD). Following routine patient testing,

116

specimens were kept at 2-8ºC and tested within 24 hours or 5 days.

117

Sample processing. For the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, total nucleic acid was

118

extracted from 200 µl of sample on the bioMérieux NucliSens® easyMAG® automated system

119

(bioMerieux, France) and eluted in 50 μl of EasyMag elution buffer. A separate reaction mix

120

containing 5 µl of the eluate, 5 µl of TaqPathTM 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix (4x), 1.5 µl of

121

combined primer/probe Mix (500nM and 125nM final concentration of primers and probes,

122

respectively), 13.5 µl of Nuclease-free Water was made for each of the assay target (N1, N2,

123

and RP). A no-template water control (NTC) and 2019-nCoV_N_ Positive Control (nCoVPC)

124

were used as template for each of the primer/probe set; Hs_RPP30_Positive Control plasmid

125

was used as template for RP primer/probe where necessary. The real-time reverse

126

transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) cycling conditions were set up on the Rotor-Gene 3000

127

thermocycler (Corbett Research, Australia) as followed: 25°C for 2 min, 50°C for 15 min, 95°C

128

for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 3 s and 55°C for 30 s with fluorescence (FAM)

129

detection during the 55°C incubation step. A sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2 if at least

130

one of the two targets (N1, N2) was detected regardless whether RP was amplified, negative if

131

none of the targets was detected and RP was detected, and invalid if RP and the two targets

132

were not detected.

133

Samples were processed for the NeuMoDxTM SARS-CoV-2 assay and the DiaSorin

134

SimplexaTM Covid-19 Direct assay according the manufacturer’s procedures. For NeuMoDxTM

135

SARS-CoV-2 assay, 400 µl of sample was mixed with 400 µl of NeuMoDx Viral Lysis Buffer in a

136

secondary tube before loading it onto the NeuMoDx™ 96 Molecular System (NeuMoDx, Ann

137

Arbor, MI). The NeuMoDx™ 96 Molecular System is a sample in results out random-access

138

platform that incorporates extraction, real-time PCR, and signal detection and analysis. A

139

sample was positive if either or both N or Nsp2 genes were detected, negative if both targets

140

were not amplified and the sample processing control (SPC2) was amplified, and indeterminate

141

or unresolved if there was an instrument error or it failed to produce a valid result. For the

142

DiaSorin SimplexaTM Covid-19 Direct assay, 50 µl of sample and 50 µl of the Reaction Mix were

143

loaded to each well and processed according to the manufacturer’s protocol on the LIASON®

144

MDX instrument (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy). Upon completion of the run, results were

145

automatically analyzed by the LIAISON® MDX Studio software. A sample was positive for

146

SARS-CoV-2 if either ORF1ab or S gene was detected, negative if both targets were not

amplified and the internal control was amplified, and invalid if there was an internal control

148

failure.

149

Analytical sensitivity and specificity of the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. A

150

series of two-fold dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 strain USA_WA1/2020 RNA were spiked in pooled

151

sputum at concentrations of 800 copies/ml to 0.05 copy/ml in order to determine the limit of

152

detection (LoD) of the assay. All samples were processed and tested in triplicate as described

153

above. The LoD was confirmed by further testing in 20 replicates. The analytical specificity was

154

determined by testing 22 samples which include 15 patient samples, 4 ATCC strains, and 3

155

commercially available nucleic acid controls.

156

Clinical evaluation of the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. The performance of the

157

modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay was established by testing 30 contrived NP swabs and

158

sputum specimens and 30 non-reactive specimens. Of the 30 contrived specimens, 20 were

159

spiked with SARS-CoV-2 strain USA_WA1/2020 RNA at 1x-2x LoD concentrations and 10 were

160

spiked at concentrations spanning the assay’s testing range (60,000 copies/ml to 234

161

copies/ml).

162

Performance comparison between NeuMoDx SARS-CoV2 assay, the Simplexa

163

Covid-19 Direct assay and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. A total of 161 NP swabs

164

were used to compare the clinical performance of two commercially available assays against

165

the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. Of those, 118 samples were tested to compare

166

NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 assay with the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, and 43 were tested

167

to compare Simplexa Covid-19 Direct assay with the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay.

168

Statistical analysis. The results obtained from each assay were compared with those

169

obtained using the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. EP Evaluator was used to calculate

170

positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and Cohen’s kappa (k)

171

with 95% confidence intervals.

RESULTS

174

Primer/probe analysis and PCR efficiency testing. The primer/probe sets used in the

175

modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay were designed by the CDC (16). Since the CDC

176

primer/probe panel became available, many SARS-CoV-2 isolates have been sequenced.

177

Therefore, we conducted an analysis based on the currently available sequences in the National

178

Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database as of March 11, 2020. Primer Blast

179

analysis showed that the primer/probe sets were specific to all available sequences for SARS-

180

CoV-2. Multiple sequence alignment (CLUSTAL multiple sequence alignment by MUSCLE) of

181

the nucleocapsid gene of SARS-CoV-2 and the two closely related coronaviruses, SARS-CoV

182

and MERS-CoV, showed the positions of the primer/probe sets (Fig. 1A). The N1 set amplified a

183

72 bp fragment of the nucleocapsid gene, N2 amplified a 67 bp of the same gene, and the

184

primer/probe set for human RP gene internal control produced a 57 bp amplicon (Fig. 1B).

185

The PCR efficiency was determined for each of the primer/probe set by testing a series

186

of 10-fold dilutions of the 200,000 copies/µl concentration of the nCoVPC plasmid. The data

187

showed that the PCR was linearity over 6 orders of magnitude with great PCR efficiency

188

(N1=111% and N2=100) and R2 of 0.99 for each of the primer/probe set (Fig. 2). The standard

189

curve generated using the known concentrations was used to accurately determine the

190

concentration of the USA_WA1/2020 RNA. It was found that the USA_WA1/2020 RNA obtained

191

from UTMB was at a concentration of 1.5 x 108 copies/ml.

192

Analytical sensitivity and specificity of the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. The

193

analytical sensitivity of the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay was determined by testing pooled

194

sputum samples spiked with a series of two-fold dilutions at concentrations of 800 copies/ml to

195

50 copy/ml of SARS-CoV-2 strain USA_WA1/2020. The lowest concentration that produced a

196

threshold cycle (Ct) value for all three replicates was determined to be the LoD; it was estimated

197

to be 200 copies/ml (Table 2A). The LoD was confirmed by further testing 20 replicates that

198

were inoculated with 200 copies/ml; all 20 replicates were tested positive (Table 2B). The

8

199

analytical specificity of the assay was determined by testing 22 samples, which included 15

200

patient samples, 4 ATCC strains, and 3 commercially available nucleic acid controls. The result

201

showed that none of the targets was detected (Table 3).

202

Clinical evaluation of the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. Since there was no

203

available positive COVID-19 specimen at the time, samples were inoculated with a wide range

204

of SARS-CoV-2 strain USA_WA1/2020 RNA to mimic the extent of viral colonization in

205

respiratory specimen. The performance of the assay was evaluated in 60 sputum samples (30

206

contrived positives and 30 negatives). Of the 30 contrived positive samples, 19 were spiked with

207

200 to 400 copies/ml of SARS-CoV-2 and one known positive patient sample; the remaining 10

208

were spiked with 234 copies/ml to 60,000 copies/ml. The results showed that the assay

209

detected SARS-CoV-2 in all 30 reactive samples, whereas no amplification was seen in the 30

210

non-reactive samples (Table 4).

211

Clinical performance comparison of the NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 assay, Simplexa

212

Covid 19 Direct assay compared to the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. One hundred

213

and sixty-one NP samples including those with a wide range of Ct values were used to compare

214

the performance of the three assays. Of those, 67 positive and 51 negative samples were used

215

to compare NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 assay with the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, while 22

216

positive and 21 negative samples were used to compare DiaSorin Simplexa Covid 19 Direct

217

assay with the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. For comparison between modified CDC

218

SARS-CoV-2 assay and Simplexa Covid 19 Direct assay, 37 samples were run within 2 days

219

and 6 were run within 5 days of first testing. For comparison between the modified CDC SARS-

220

CoV-2 assay and NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 assay, 104 samples were run within a day and 14

221

were run within 5 days of first testing. All 89 positive and 72 negative samples tested by the

222

modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay matched the results using the two commercial assays

223

evaluated yielding a 100% PPV and NPV for each assay (Table 5A). Two samples that were

224

negative on the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay resulted in indeterminate on the NeuMoDx

9

225

for the Nsp2. NeuMoDx did not yield a Ct value for one of the two targets in 5 samples: 4 were

226

negative for Nsp2 gene target and 1 was negative for the N gene target. However, they still

227

considered positive as only one detected target was needed for a positive result.

228

Although 100% agreement was observed among the assays, further analysis showed

229

that there were some differences in the Ct values for each assay. The lowest and highest Ct

230

values recorded for the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay were 12.24 and 38.52; for the

231

NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 assay 11.45 and 36.65, and for DiaSorin Simplexa Covid 19 Direct

232

assay 12.0 and 34.3. The average Ct value difference in samples run within 24 hours between

233

NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay was -0.14, and -2.13

234

between samples run within 5 days. The overall Ct value difference for all samples run between

235

the two assays was -0.346. On the other hand, the average Ct values difference between

236

samples run within 2 days between DiaSorin Simplexa Covid 19 Direct assay and the modified

237

CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay was -2.42, and -6.0 between samples run within 5 days. The overall

238

Ct value difference for all samples between the two assays was -3.47.

239

Apart from the clinical performance evaluation, we also assessed the workflow of each

240

assay and compared the time of sample-to-result for each platform. Based on 8 samples/run, it

241

was estimated to be 2 h and 50 min for modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, which included a 35

242

min extraction time, 90 min PCR run, and 45 min of hands-on time. It was estimated to be 1 h

243

and 40 min including 15 min hands-on time for DiaSorin Simplexa Covid 19 Direct assay. The

244

NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 assay resulted samples in 1 h and 25 min which included a 5 min

245

hands-on time (Table 5B). The above estimation was based on 8 samples due to number of

246

samples that could be loaded on the DiaSorin instrument per run. However, the NeuMoDx

247

instrument is a random-access platform that can process and result 24 samples at a time in less

248

than two hours. That enabled the NeuMoDx assay to have a throughput of 96 samples per 8-hr

249

shift compared to 40 samples on the DiaSorin Simplexa Covid 19 Direct assay, and 40 samples

250

on the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay if sample processing and PCR runs were staggered.

DISCUSSION

253

It has been three months since the WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 a global pandemic.

254

Although the overall infection and death rates of COVID-19 has been declining in some

255

countries, it has increased in others. Therefore, the ongoing pandemic still poses great risks for

256

many around the world, and with the easing of certain restrictions, the need for health care

257

facilities to be equipped and accurately test for the virus to limit its spread is as crucial as it will

258

ever be. To that extent, laboratories have brought in SARS-CoV-2 assays and molecular

259

platforms to respond to the need of their communities. There have been a few publications on

260

head-to-head comparisons of those assays, including a couple very recently as we preparing

261

this article, in order to shed light on their performance characteristics and help laboratories

262

make informed decisions on acquiring those assays (9, 17-19).

263

In this study, we validated a modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay and compared its

264

performance to two commercial automated sample-to-answer assays for the detection of SARS-

265

CoV-2 RNA. We confirmed that the primer/probe sets were specific to all SARS-CoV-2 clades

266

based on the available genome sequences including those that were not available at the time

267

when those primer sets were originally designed. Not only were those primers/probe sets

268

specific to SARS-CoV-2 based on in silico study, there were no false positive results in cross-

269

reactivity experiments using a panel of bacterial and closely-related virus targets. We found that

270

the primer/probe sets have high PCR efficiency and a LoD of 200 copies/ml. The clinical

271

sensitivity and specificity of the assay was also evaluated in samples with different

272

concentrations of viral RNA. The results showed that the assay is specific to SARS-CoV-2 as it

273

was only detected in the reactive samples.

274

The other objective of this study was to compare the clinical performance of two

275

commercially available assays in out laboratory, NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 assay and Simplexa

276

Covid-19 Direct assay, to the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. There was an overall

277

agreement of 100% between the results obtained on the commercial assays and those on the

278

modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. It is worth noting that while we found that the modified CDC

279

SARS-CoV-2 assay has an LoD of 200 copies/ml whereas the reported LoD in the package

280

inserts For NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 assay and DiaSorin Simplexa Covid 19 Direct is 250

281

copies/ml and 500 copies/ml for assay, respectively.

282

A closer look at the Ct value differences between the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay

283

and the commercial assays suggests that there is not a significant difference between the

284

modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay and NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2; however, there seems to be a

285

greater difference in Ct values between DiaSorin Simplexa CoV-2 Direct assay and the modified

286

CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, with DiaSorin having lower Ct values. The difference is even greater

287

in samples that were run 5 days after the routine testing on the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2

288

assay. This is in line with previously published data that showed Ct values on DiaSorin was

289

much lower than those on an the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay by an average Ct

290

difference of -2.1 (18). The overall data also suggest that depending on the viral burden in the

291

samples NP samples can be refrigerated for at least 5 days and still maintain the RNA integrity

292

for viral detection by the assays in this study.

293

A limitation of this study was that the same samples were not tested by the three

294

different assays, so a head-to-head comparison of the three assays was not performed. This

295

was due to the limit of available kits for routine testing in patient care. However, we did a head-

296

to-head comparison of the assay’s workflow. The NeuMoDx 96 molecular system is a sample-

297

to-answer and random-access platform that automatically performs nucleic acid extraction,

298

amplification, and signal detection and analysis requiring only very little human interaction for

299

loading and scanning the samples (20). It has the shortest TAT and highest throughput of the

300

three assays. DiaSorin Simplexa CoV-2 Direct assay involves a simple operation procedure that

301

does not include an extraction step; it has, however, much lower throughput than NeuMoDx.

302

The modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay is singleplex; each target must be run in different tubes,

12

303

as opposed to the two commercial assays, which are multiplex. It requires separate extraction

304

steps on the EasyMag which can extract up to 24 samples at a time, longer hands-on time, and

305

has much lower throughput compared to NeuMoDx. It has comparable throughput to DiaSorin if

306

nucleic acid extraction and PCR reaction tubes for the next sample batch are prepared before

307

the PCR cycles of the previous batch ends. Therefore, although the three assays have the

308

same accuracy, the overall workflow favors the commercial platforms.

309

In conclusion, diagnostic laboratories around the world have faced with unprecedented

310

challenges due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Thousands of SARS-CoV-2 tests are being

311

executed in any given laboratory each day. This testing requirement has not only forced

312

laboratory to bring in new technologists to help with testing, but it has also led to the shortage of

313

testing reagents. Consequently, laboratories had to acquire different assays and platforms to

314

meet testing demand. As much as LDT assays, such as the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay,

315

were instrumental at the onset of the pandemic for COVID-19 testing, their overall testing

316

capacity are limited. Therefore, it is necessary for laboratories to acquire multiple high

317

throughput automated instruments that can test high number of samples quickly with almost the

318

same number of qualified laboratory professionals.
