Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered concerns about the emergence of more infectious and
pathogenic viral strains. As a public health measure, efficient screening methods are needed to
determine the functional effects of new sequence variants. Here we show that structural
modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor, the first step in
host-cell entry, predicts many novel variant combinations with enhanced binding affinities. By
focusing on natural variants at the Spike-hACE2 interface and assessing over 700 mutant
complexes, our analysis reveals that high-affinity Spike mutations (including N440K, S443A,
G476S, E484R, G502P) tend to cluster near known human ACE2 recognition sites (K31 and
K353). These Spike regions are conformationally flexible, allowing certain mutations to optimize
interface interaction energies. Although most human ACE2 variants tend to weaken binding
affinity, they can interact with Spike mutations to generate high-affinity double mutant
complexes, suggesting variation in individual susceptibility to infection. Applying structural
analysis to highly transmissible variants, we find that circulating point mutations S447N, E484K

and N501Y form high-affinity complexes (~40% more than wild-type). By combining predicted
affinities and available antibody escape data, we show that fast-spreading viral variants exploit
combinatorial mutations possessing both enhanced affinity and antibody resistance, including
S447N/E484K, E484K/N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y. Thus, three-dimensional modeling of
the Spike/hACE2 complex predicts changes in structure and binding affinity that correlate with
transmissibility and therefore can help inform future intervention strategies.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic poses several interrelated scientific challenges that include
understanding its biological origins and evolutionary trajectory, deciphering the mechanisms of
virus-host interactions, and developing effective intervention strategies. Progress in
understanding viral mutations will impact how we assess virus-host interactions and design
intervention strategies. A major concern of the COVID-19 disease is that its causative virus
SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to increase its ability to infect human hosts, as highlighted by recent
identification of novel viral mutations in COVID-19 patients in multiple countries
(cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov)1. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences suggests that
there are thousands of mutations whose biological and health implications are unknown (CoVGLUE database). It is thus important to develop methods that can effectively identify
biologically significant COVID-19 mutations which can serve as surveillance tools for emerging
infectious strains and guide development of new vaccines.
Advances in understanding the molecular basis of SARS-CoV infection in the last 15 years have
led to the identification of mutations that enable coronaviruses to jump from animal to human
hosts, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying viral entry into human cells2; 3; 4; 5.
Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, are enveloped viruses with a
positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. Several structural proteins are embedded in the
viral envelope, notably the Spike (S) proteins, which are heavily glycosylated and assemble into
homotrimer complexes that bind human cell surface receptors and thereby help the virus gain
entry into its host5; 6. The S protein is composed of S1 and S2 subunits, which respectively form,

the head and stem of the protein. The S1 subunit contains the host receptor-binding domain
(RBD, residues 318-510 for SARS-CoV); the S2 subunit is membrane-associated and anchors the
Spike protein in the viral envelope. Coronaviruses SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 use the S
RBD to enter host cells by binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)
receptors, triggering the subsequent virus-host cell fusion event4; 5; 6; 7; 8. This central
mechanism of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection accounts for the importance of the S protein
in understanding cross-species adaptation4 and current therapeutic development9; 10; 11; 12. In
contrast to SARS-related viruses, the Spike proteins of MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E coronaviruses
use the dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) and aminopeptidase N (APN) receptors, respectively, to
gain entry into host cells5.
Recognition of the ACE2 receptor by S RBD is a limiting step in viral infection and cross-species
adaptation in SARS-CoV strains4; 13. Biochemical and crystallographic studies of SARS-CoV SACE2 complexes have identified key amino acid residues responsible for binding specificity
(Figure 1a). Specifically, the determinants of high-affinity ACE2 association are the interaction
interface residues N479 and T487 in the SARS-CoV S-protein RBD2. On the complementary ACE2
interaction surface, residues K31 and K353 are sensitively influenced by S-protein positions 479
and 487, respectively. Consequently, residues K31 and K353 and their vicinities define the
hACE2 interaction hotspots for SARS-CoV S proteins isolated from animals and humans2; 14.
Analysis of SARS-CoV cross-species adaptations has uncovered specific residues in the S-protein
that are favored by ACE2 from different species (Figure 1a)15. For example, hACE2 prefers
residue N at S-protein position 479, whereas K, N and R residues are found in palm civet ACE2.

At S-protein position 487, both human and civet ACE2 favor residue T, but residue S is much
less preferred in humans. Other S-protein determinants of ACE2 association and cross-species
adaptation include residues Y442, L472, and D48014. Although Y442 is found in civet and human
SARS-CoV, F442 is thought to be preferred in human hosts, as found in the SARS-CoV strain
isolated in 2008. At position 472, F is adapted to hACE2, whereas P to civet; at position 480,
hACE2 favors residue D, whereas civet ACE2 prefers the G residue. Interestingly, enhanced
adaptation to hACE2 can be engineered by simultaneous Y442F and L472F mutations14. Thus,
residue-level analysis sheds light on the vital role of S RBD mutations in receptor recognition,
viral transmission and cross-species infection. Since structural analyses have revealed extensive
similarities between the receptor binding modes of SARS-related viruses, our accumulated
knowledge of SARS-CoV will provide an indispensable guide to analysis of mutations in the
SARS-CoV-2 S-hACE2 receptor complex6; 8; 16; 17; 18.
Single mutations in ACE2 can also have significant impact on host susceptibility to infection.
Rats are resistant to SARS-CoV infection largely because of a single residue difference from
hACE2 at position 353, one of its interaction hotspots. By mutating residue K353 to H found in
rats, the variant human ACE2 has a low affinity for the S protein2. Likewise, for other species,
residue differences in the ACE2 interaction interface lead to varying affinities and
susceptibilities to SARS-CoV13. Moreover, analysis of hACE2 mutations using deep mutagenesis
has provided insights into the specificity of SARS-CoV-2 S-hACE2 interactions and development
of engineered soluble receptors as S decoys19. Thus, a complementary assessment of the role of
hACE2 variants is needed to provide a comprehensive map of SARS-CoV-2 S-hACE2 interactions.

Global surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 using genome sequencing has identified over 5000 amino
acid substitutions, deletions and insertions in the S protein alone (CoV-GLUE). This large pool of
changes poses a significant challenge for functional screening, which will require multi-level
analysis encompassing sequence, structural, cellular and whole animal approaches. Recent
emergence of fast-spreading SARS-CoV-2 lineages in UK, South Africa, Brazil and other countries
reinforces the need for surveillance and to anticipate infectious mutations (nextstrain.org/sarscov-2). Specifically, the recurring S mutations E484K, N501Y, D614G and their combinations
have been implicated in increased viral transmission. The widespread S protein mutation,
D614G, has also been found to increase viral infectivity in cell cultures1; 20; 21. Structural
modeling suggests that D614G promotes an open conformational state, making the S-protein
available for receptor binding22. Thus, concerted efforts to structurally and functionally
characterize the new variants are urgently needed to uncover their contributions to receptor
recognition and impact on the efficacy of current therapeutics and vaccines.
Here we apply a structural modeling approach to enable efficient screening of many mutant
SARS-CoV-2 S-hACE2 complexes by computing their binding affinities, which have been shown
to be a reliable measure of SARS-CoV’s potential to infect host cells2; 3; 4. Our approach,
originally developed for large-scale modeling of microRNA-protein complexes23; 24; 25; 26, aims to
fill the gap between sequence-based analysis and laboratory confirmation of functional
mutations, which is often time consuming and resource-intensive. Importantly, we show that
our method reproduces known affinity trends associated with key SARS-CoV mutations in crossspecies adaptation mutations identified in previous SARS-CoV studies, as well as infectivity data
for SARS-CoV-2 S mutations. We then assess the effects of 731 natural variant combinations at

the interface of SARS-CoV-2 S and hACE2 proteins. We found that 31 high-affinity S mutations,
including N440K, S443A, G476S, E484R, G502P, are clustered in the vicinities of two known
interaction hotspots of hACE2. Significantly, we show that computed binding affinities for
recent fast-spreading variants have high affinities (in decreasing order of affinity, S477N/E484K,
E484K/N501Y, K417T/E484K/N501Y) and are resistant to neutralizing antibodies or overlap
with their binding sites, consistent with their rapid spread and emergence of combinatorial
mutations. Together these results suggest productive regions for future experimental work and
indicate that structural modeling can be an effective surveillance tool for tracking emerging
mutations in infectious COVID-19 strains.

Results
Structural modeling captures key aspects of Spike-hACE2 interactions
To ascertain the accuracy of our structural modeling approach (Figure 1b), we compared
measured and predicted affinities of multiple SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 variants for hACE2. We
modeled the S-ACE2 complex as the interaction between S RBD (residues ~320 to ~520) and the
extracellular N-terminal peptidase domain of ACE2 (residues ~20 to 613). Experimental affinity
measurements using bio-layer interferometry and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) have
shown that hACE2 binds to SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD with a greater affinity than to SARS-CoV S-RBD
(Table 1). Specifically, the measured ratio KD(SARS-CoV)/ KD(SARS-CoV-2) is greater than 4 for
both experimental methods. Our computed binding affinities confirm that hACE2 has a stronger
affinity for SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD than for SARS-CoV S-RBD (-41.1 kcal/mol versus -22.0 kcal/mol,

Table 1). For both native complexes, the favorable solvation (hydrophobic) and van der Waals
interactions are balanced by unfavorable electrostatic and entropic forces.
Since certain mutations at five positions (Y442, L472, N479, D480, and T487) are responsible for
the ability of SARS-CoV to adapt to human from animal ACE2 (Figures 1a)4; 14; 15, a sensitive test
of our structural modeling approach is whether it can reproduce the expected binding affinity
patterns for such mutations. We consider seven cases representing distinct animal-human
adaptive mutations in the SARS-CoV S-protein (Figure 2a)3: adaptations from civet, an
intermediate animal host, to human ACE2 (Y442F, L472F); mutations obtained by reversing
civet to human adaptations (L472P, N479K, D480G); unfavorable mutation (T487S); and a
previously designed double mutant (Y442F/L472F) optimized for hACE2 binding. A plot of the
computed affinities versus measured association constants3, 1/ KD, shows that structural
modeling captures the overall trend in measured affinities produced by the key SARS-CoV S
protein mutations (R2=0.61; Figure 2a). Examining specific examples, the point mutations Y442F
and L472F, which are adapted to hACE2, produced better affinities relative to the WT complex
(-26.0 kcal/mol and -27.8 kcal/mol versus -22.0 kcal/mol). Interestingly, the optimized
Y442F/472F double mutant generated a very high affinity complex (-42.6 kcal/mol), consistent
with association (1/KD value over 3 times greater than that for L472F) and infectivity data3.
When two of the hACE2-adapted mutations in SARS-CoV are reversed to those found in civet
(L472P, N479K), the predicted affinities decreased dramatically (-4.9 kcal/mol and -14.8
kcal/mol, respectively). Lastly, the mutation T487S, which is judged to be less adapted to
human ACE2 based on frequencies of occurrence of these mutants in civet and human SARSCoV, yielded a poorer affinity (-16.5 kcal/mol), in agreement with expectation.

Another test of our method is to compare predicted binding affinities to measured infectivity
data for variants in the SARS-CoV-2 S-hACE2 complex. Quantification of the effects of S variants
using infectivity assays is correlated with their binding affinities, as well as other factors
(dynamics of S and its interactions with other host proteins). A recent work identified 12 natural
variants in the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein at the interface that show significantly lower infectivity
(based on luciferase reporter levels) in comparison with the highest-frequency variant, which
we call “wild type (WT)”27. Predicted affinities for these mutations indicate that 9 out of 12
cases have lower binding affinities compared to WT, and the mean affinity of all cases is
reduced by 40% (-25.8 kcal/mol compare to -41.1 kcal/mol for WT; Figure 2b). Thus, structural
modeling correctly reproduces affinity trends for previously characterized SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 S mutations, suggesting that the approach is sufficiently accurate for general
investigations of SARS-CoV-2 S-hACE2 mutant complexes.
High-affinity SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutations are clustered near hACE2 interaction hotspots
Using 16,083 sequenced genomes (downloaded May 4, 2020), we found 739 SARS-CoV-2 S
single amino acid replacements based on our variant calling pipeline (Suppl. Figure 1). We
chose 42 S and 16 hACE2 interface variants to produce 731 possible combinations of complexes
with zero or one mutation in each protein (Methods). We represent associations for all 731
mutant complexes as a normalized affinity matrix, ∆Gmutant/∆GWT (heatmap in Figure 3a).
There are 31 high-affinity complexes, defined as >20% of ∆GWT (magenta), 111 complexes with
WT-like affinities (±20% of ∆G WT), 435 low-affinity complexes (20% below ∆G WT but <0), and
154 complexes with unfavorable formation energies that are predicted to remain unbound

(∆Gmutant >0, blue). Thus, mutations that produce high affinity complexes are relatively rare
(4%), while low-affinity mutations are relatively common (60%). The unbound complexes
(∆Gmutant >0) can be interpreted to mean that some S-hACE2 mutation combinations are
incompatible with each other and therefore most likely do not occur in COVID19 patients.
Superimpositions of all 31 high-affinity complexes show that their S mutations form two
clusters at opposite ends of S RBD’s concave interaction surface (Figure 3b, magenta spheres).
Solvent-exposed ends of the receptor binding motif (RBM, residues 440-505), a large loop that
directly binds hACE2, are more susceptible to conformational fluctuations; thus, the clustering
of mutations in these regions likely reflects the potential to generate more stable or higher
affinity complexes. An exception to this rule is the high-affinity mutant S494T, which occurs
near the short beta strand in the center of S interaction surface. The rare occurrence of highaffinity mutations in the central RBM interface region could imply that the opposite-facing
hACE2 α1 ridge region does not tolerate S mutations. Overall, our identification of high-affinity
S mutations suggests structural regions at the interface where they are most likely to occur.
Complexes with a single mutation in either the Spike or hACE2 protein
To focus on more common complexes in infected individuals, we analyzed the affinities of
complexes in which one of the proteins represents the WT (highest frequency) genetic variant
(Figure 3a, first row and column). Related experimental studies have focused on random
mutations in either S or hACE2, generated using error-prone polymerases19; 28. Narrowing our
focus to naturally occurring variants at the interaction interface, we find that structural

modeling of hACE2 variants generally result in lower affinity, whereas Spike variants span a
wide affinity range.
We found no high-affinity hACE2 variants (20% above WT affinity) and, with the exception of
D38E and E329G, most hACE2 variants in fact lead to lower binding affinities (Figure 3a). These
results imply that with WT S as the binding partner, most hACE2 variants reduce the ability of
the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter host cells. This is consistent with experimental assessment of 165
natural hACE2 variants from mutagenesis experiments, which showed that only 5% of hACE2
variants have increased affinity for WT S, whereas 65% have decreased affinity and 27% have
similar affinity as WT hACE229.
Two Spike variants (N440K and G476S), both in solvent-exposed residues at opposite ends of
the binding interface, form high-affinity complexes in combination with WT hACE2 (Figure
4a,b). Compared with the WT complex, N440K gains 6 kcal/mol in solvation energy and 18
kcal/mol in van der Waals energy, whereas G476S gains 8 kcal/mol in van der Waals energy and
27 kcal/mol in electrostatic energy. These high-affinity cases indicate that improved affinities
are produced by favorable short-range (van der Waals) and environment-specific (solvation and
electrostatic) interactions.
Among the unfavorable Spike mutations, L452F and P491T occur at or near the antiparallel beta
strands located in the middle of S-RBM’s concave interaction surface, supporting our
observation about the rarity of high-affinity mutations in this region. Compared with the WT
complex, these cases have unfavorable electrostatic interactions (loss of ~30 kcal/mol) and an
increase in entropic energy (~10 kcal/mol). Thus, the effects of S mutations vary across its

binding interface and are influenced by the properties of the opposite-facing hACE2 binding
surface. Even though some S mutations are unlikely to form complexes with WT hACE2, they
can interact favorably with specific hACE2 variants (discussed below), suggesting that
compensatory changes in the partner protein can promote binding.
Complexes with a single mutation each in Spike and hACE2 proteins
Experimental studies of mutations in the S-hACE2 complex have focused on amino acid changes
in either Spike or hACE2 protein19; 28. This limitation is due to the geometric increase of
combinatorial space when mutations in both proteins are considered. Considering only
complexes with mutations at the binding interface (Figure 3a, excluding first row and column),
we find that complexes with a mutation in both proteins account for 29 of the 31 high-affinity
complexes we identified. This suggests there is a nontrivial probability of generating mutuallyreinforcing mutations in the S-hACE2 complex. Indeed, the hACE2 variants N33D, D38E, T92V,
E329G and M383I interact favorably with many S mutations (Figure 3a). The top 7 high-affinity
double mutation cases, in decreasing affinity, are S-S443A/hACE-E329G, S-G502P/hACE2-T92V,
S-T470S/hACE2-W69C, S-N440K/hACE2-T92I, S-S443A/hACE2-D38E, S-Q498N/hACE2-E329G,
and S-G502P/hACE2-M383I (superimposed and individual complexes in Figures 4c and Suppl.
Figure 3). In contrast, three hACE2 variants (A65V, A102P and G377W) interact unfavorably
with most S mutations examined. Using binding affinity as a proxy for viral infectivity at the
cellular level, these results indicate that the patterns of favorable and unfavorable
combinations represented in the affinity matrix can be exploited as a map to predict

susceptibility of individuals or groups with specific hACE2 variants to infection by viral strains
with mutations in the Spike protein.
Conformational changes induced by high-affinity mutations in the Spike-ACE2 complex
To probe the observed mutation patterns more deeply, we examined the conformational
changes induced by high-affinity mutations in the S-hACE2 complex. For this purpose, we
considered the top 9 high-affinity complexes (Figure 4 and Suppl. Figure 3). Relative to the WT
complex (Spike, wheat; hACE2, yellow), the single Spike G476S mutation generated a large
conformational switch in a local RBM loop (residues 475-AGST-478) causing it to orient toward
the N-terminal of hACE2 α1 helix, a region found to have more contacts with the S-protein of
SARS-CoV-2 than with SARS-CoV (Figure 4a)16. This switch dramatically improved the
electrostatic energy of the complex (from 18.2 kcal/mol to -9.0 kcal/mol); the short-range van
der Waals energy also improved by 9 kcal/mol. The single Spike N440K mutation occurs near
the anti-parallel β-sheet core of RBD but produced an extended perturbation in the RBM loop
region facing the hACE2 K353 hotspot (Figure 4b). This mutation improved the solvation (by 6.3
kcal/mol) and van der Waals (18.0 kcal/mol) energy contributions to the binding affinity.
Turning to high-affinity, double mutant complexes (Figure 4c and Suppl. Figure 3), most have
improved contact van der Waals energies (gain of 10-20 kcal/mol), and complexes SG502P/hACE2-T92V and S-T470S/hACE2-W69C also have enhanced electrostatic energies (gain
of ~30 kcal/mol). Superimpositions of these complexes reveal the structural movements
accounting for gains in their energy components (Figure 4c). On the hACE2 interface, variants
T92V/I cause the α1 helix and a loop (residues 87-92) to move closer to the S interface,

reflecting improved van der Waals energies. On the S interface, four mutations (N440K, S443A,
Q498N, G502P) generated significant conformational changes in two loops (437-452, 494-507).
In conclusion, high-affinity mutations in S and hACE2 proteins produce structural changes in
both proteins to optimize the interaction interface.
High-affinity Spike mutations with the potential to increase transmission efficiency
Multiple lines of evidence can be used to suggest the most likely candidates that can potentially
increase SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. To derive high-confidence predictions, we consider the
common S variants from the 10 top-ranked affinities both among all individual variant
combinations and averaged over all hACE2 variants (Figure 3a,d). This criterion ensures
consensus between the two ways (individual and averaged affinities) of assessing high-affinity
complexes. The SARS-CoV-2 S mutations fulfilling this stringent criterion are N440K, S443A,
G476S, E484R and G502P. The affinity ranking of G476S is dominated by its binding to WT
hACE2, whereas the other three S mutants interact favorably with multiple hACE2 variants
(Figure 3a).
The significance of the high-confidence, high-affinity S variants can be analyzed based on
sequence conservation of their residue positions and their proximity to the key residues in
SARS-CoV. Multiple sequence alignment of SARS-CoV strains (from human, civet, and bat) and
SARS-CoV-2 implies that the equivalent receptor recognition residues for SARS-CoV-2 S are
L455, F486, Q493, S494, and N50115. Although the predicted high-affinity S variants do not
overlap with these positions, sequence alignment shows that SARS-CoV-2 S N440 and G502 are
100% conserved and its S443, G476 and E484 positions are conserved in SARS-CoV strains,

suggesting that these interface residues must play a role in receptor recognition and that
certain mutations at these positions optimize virus-host interactions. In particular, at position
443, the corresponding residue in SARS-CoV strains is a conserved A, so the S443A mutation in
SARS-CoV-2 could account for its enhanced binding to hACE2.
The high-confidence mutations are also predicted to alter the interaction interface (Figure 4
and Suppl. Figure 3). The G502P mutation, which is adjacent to the key N501 residue, alters the
local interface conformation, providing structural support for increased S-hACE2 binding (Figure
4a). The N440K mutation involves a charge change and an extended conformation alteration in
the RBM loop (Figure 4b). Thus, combined conservation, energetic, and structural analysis
implies that certain point mutations near the interface have the ability to reprogram the
interface conformations to produce high-affinity S-hACE2 complexes, which is the basis for
efficient transmission of SARS coronaviruses that utilize ACE2 for host entry.
High-affinity Spike mutations N440K and E484K/R coincide with antibody escape mutants
Since solved complexes have shown that some promising neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) for
clinical applications bind to the hACE2 interface region of the S protein30, it is interesting to
determine whether our identified high-affinity variants (Figures 3 and 4) overlap with the
binding sites of NAbs. A recent study has shown that certain S mutations are resistant to three
NAbs (C121, C135 and C144) currently being evaluated for their therapeutic potential28. Among
the antibody escape mutants identified using a cell-based infectivity assay, N440K is resistant to
C135 and E484K to C121. Both of these mutations involve a net change in charge, a likely
determinant of antibody resistance. By our affinity measures N440K is predicted both to be

capable of escaping antibody C134 and to bind hACE2 with high affinity, attributes that make it
a prime candidate for viral surveillance. If electrostatic energy is the deciding factor in C121
antibody resistance, then the E484K variant can be regarded as chemically similar to our top
affinity candidate E484R; indeed, recent deep mutagenesis analysis showed that E484R is
resistant to three neutralizing antibodies (COV2-2050,COV2-2096, COV2-2479; Figure 5b)31.
Structural mapping of N440K and E484R variants confirms that they overlap, respectively, with
the independent binding sites of C135 and C121 on the S protein (Figure 5a,b). Given the
infectivity potential and resistance of N440K and E484K/R variants, there is a need to monitor
their spread.
Structural/energetic basis of fast-spreading Spike variants
The newly identified S interface variants now in wide circulation across the globe include
K417N/T, N439K, Y453F, S477N, E484K, N501Y and their combinations. To correlate affinity
with transmission data, we consider the averaged affinity for all naturally occurring hACE2
variants, in order to account for their conformational repertoire and occurrence in different
populations. Averaged affinities predicted by structural modeling indicate that the mutations
fall into three groups (Figure 6a): very high-affinity (80 to 90% better that WT;
S477N/E484K/N501Y, S477N/E484K and E484K/N501Y), high-affinity (40 to 50% better than
WT; S477N, E484K, N501Y), WT-like (S477N/N501Y, K417T/E484K/N501Y, N439K, Y453F), and
low-affinity (<70% of WT; K417T/E484K, K417T, K417T/N501Y).. The highest affinity group
includes fast-spreading double mutants S477N/E484K and E484K/N501Y in Brazil, South Africa,
US and UK (55587954 (medrxiv.org), cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov); the triple mutant

S477N/E484K/N501Y with the best affinity has not been reported. The high affinity group
consists of single mutants S477N, E484K and N501Y, indicating that the fast-spreading variants
combine these mutations to achieve higher binding affinities; recent molecular dynamics
simulations also predicted that S477N has a higher affinity than WT32. The WT-like group
includes K417T/E484K/N501Y (spreading in South Africa, Brazil), N439K (Denmark) and Y453F
(UK).
Antibody resistance is another crucial determinant of viral transmission.Mutants E484K/R
exhibit high levels of antibody resistance (C121, COV2-2050, COV2-2096) and K417N/T have
some degree of resistance (STE90-C11, COV2-2082), but the other mutations display negligible
antibody resistance (Figure 5a,b). Thus, variants S477N/E484K, E484K/N501Y and
K417T/E484K/N501Y indicate that they combine high affinity and antibody resistant mutations,
which may account for their spread in multiple countries.
In contrast to E484K and N501Y, K417T alone appears not favored for receptor recognition, and
this is reflected in reduced affinities for K417T/N501Y and K417T/E484K combinations, which
are not observed together in sequenced viral genomes; K417N has similar characteristics (not
shown). In vitro selection of optimized Spike RBD repeatedly recovered S477N, E484K and
N501Y mutations but not K417N/T33. This indicates that K417N/T is not a major contributor to
affinity, in agreement with our predicted binding affinities. Thus, the selective advantage of
K417N/T is likely their ability to confer antibody resistance.
Superimposed structure ensembles for all hACE2 variants additionally reveal structural features
that generate favorable complexes (Figure 6a). Although the E484K mutation does not interact

directly with hACE2, it modifies the conformation of Spike RBD’s loop, resulting in a significant
gain of average solvation energy (-11 kcal/mol). Further, K484’s sidechain shows considerable
conformational variability in different hACE2 variant complexes (Figure 6b). In contrast, the
mutant N501Y residue is closely packed in proximity of the K353 hotspot of hACE2 and its
sidechain shows only minimal conformational changes. The favorable affinity for N501Y is
produced by gains in entropic (6 kcal/mol) and van der Waals (7 kcal/mol) energies.
Remarkably, the configurations of the lysine (hACE2 K353) and tyrosine (S Y501) sidechains
suggest they could participate in favorable cation-π interactions, with the lysine being offcenter of the tyrosine’s aromatic ring (Figure 6c). Estimation of the strength of this effect would
require rigorous quantum-mechanical calculations. The high-affinity of the double mutant
E484K/ N501Y is produced by gains in solvation (11 kcal/mol), van der Waals (2 kcal/mol) and
entropic (5 kcal/mol) energies, indicating the approximate additive effect of its energy
components. In sum, our analyses provide structural/energetic insights into the spread of the
new SAR-CoV-2 variants.

Discussion
Surveillance of biologically significant COVID-19 mutations is an important public health
measure. While the implications of the vast majority of the ~5,000 S variants documented so far
are unknown, already a handful of recently identified variants that appear to have increased
transmissibility are spreading rapidly around the globe. As antiviral treatments and vaccines are
being administered on a large scale, it is likely that selection pressures could alter viral

evolutionary dynamics to favor resistant strains. Development of effective surveillance tools is
needed to anticipate emerging mutations and inform treatment strategies.
Since detailed experimental analysis of infectivity for all possible combinations of hACE2 and S
variants is impractical, we used in silico structural modeling of S-hACE2 complexes to predict
structural changes and binding affinities for novel variants. Our exhaustive structural
assessment of all combinations of naturally occurring mutations at the SARS-CoV-2 S-hACE2
interface has uncovered many mutants with significantly higher predicted affinities (>20%)
relative to the WT complex. Surprisingly, many of these cases arise from mutually-reinforcing
mutations in S and hACE2 proteins resulting from their favorable interactions. In biological
terms, this means that carriers of certain hACE2 variants are predicted to be more susceptible
to viral strains with specific mutations in the S protein. The high-confidence, high-affinity S
mutations include N440K, S443A, G476S, E484R and G502P (Figure 5b), and among these
N440K and E484K/R stand out for their ability to escape surveillance of some neutralizing
antibodies (C135 and C121)28.
Our analysis of recently evolved, rapidly expanding strains with S mutations at the interaction
interface provides insights into their relative affinities, molecular interactions, and the role of
combinatorial mutations. We found that highly-transmissible S477N, E484K and N501Y
mutations have greater average affinities than WT over known hACE2 variants. The double
mutants S477N/E484K and E484K/N501Y have very high affinities (~80% above WT), which
correlates well with its rapid spread in multiple countries (e.g., Brazil, South Africa, UK, US).
Our structural analysis suggests that the widespread N501Y mutation likely introduces

stabilizing cation-π interactions between S Y501 and hACE2 K353, whereas E484K enhances the
solvation energy. Interestingly, our models predict that the triple mutation
K417T/E484K/N501Y, which arose in the ancestral lineage E484K/N501Y, has about the same
affinity as WT, although its frequency is increasing around the globe. The overlap of these
positions with antibody binding sites confer robust resistance to neutralizing antibodies (Figure
5a,b)28; 31, thus offsetting the predicted loss of binding affinity to favor transmission of the triple
mutant. Our analysis also predicts that the unobserved triple mutant S477N/E484K/N501Y has
the highest affinity among all combinations of fast-spreading mutations examined.
Mutations outside of the interaction interface can also influence receptor recognition and viral
transmission, as demonstrated by mutations identified in deep mutagenesis and in vitro
evolution studies19; 33; 34. Indeed, identification of a stabilizing D614G mutation in the neck of
the Spike protein that increases its density on viral particles1 highlights the need for further
study of mutations outside of S RBD in the new SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Our predictive modeling
of interface mutations in the S-hACE2 complex complements experimental studies19; 34 and
supports the emerging view that combinatorial mutations in SARS-CoV-2 can simultaneously
maintain high-affinity binding to hACE2 and evade antibodies (e.g., by N440K, E484K/R,
K417N/T) in human hosts. We propose that structural modeling of novel variants as they arise
could help predict which mutations may pose the greatest dangers in the ongoing pandemic
and accelerate the development of new vaccines to protect against the spread of new highly
infectious strains.

Materials and Methods
Computational pipeline
Since the S-hACE2 complexes for SARS-CoV5; 35 and SARS-CoV-26; 8; 16; 17 have been solved,
structural modeling provides a general method for analyzing mutations in these complexes.
Based on previously established methodology, our computational pipeline for assessing
mutations in complexes consists of the following steps (Figure 1b): (1) use bioinformatics
algorithms to analyze SNPs and nonsynonymous mutations in proteins; (2) utilize solved protein
structures to simulate mutations in component proteins, followed by structural refinement of
the all-atom binary complex; and (3) compute the complex’s binding affinity score using
physics-based interaction energies. Steps 2 and 3 are computationally intensive, requiring 3
days per complex on a linux cluster with parallel structure minimization runs.
Bioinformatics analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein mutations
Mutations in the S protein were derived from SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in GISAID, a
publically available database. We used the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 sequence as the
reference, wild-type sequence (NCBI’s NC_045512.2) for subsequent analysis. Genome data for
submitted SARS-CoV-2 isolates were retrieved from GISAID on May 4, 2020, yielding a total of
16,083 sequences. To derive mutations in the S protein, we implemented the following
computational pipeline (flowchart in Suppl. Figure 1). First, we aligned the reference S
sequence to all annotated SARS-CoV-2 CDS sequences using promer, a script in the MUMMER4
package for rapid alignment of large DNA sequences. Second, from the aligned CDS sequences,

we extracted SNPs using show-snps, a MUMMER4 utility program for reporting polymorphisms
(SNPs) and insertions/deletions from promer’s alignment output. Third, we filtered for first
Spike reading frame and removed ambiguous (e.g., nonsense) bases in SNPs. Finally, we
determined the nonsynonymous variants and computed the frequency of each mutation. Our
variant calling code is available on Github (https://github.com/GunsalusPiano/covid-snpanalysis).
Variants in the human ACE2 protein
We used hACE2 variants identified in two previous studies36; 37. Since the variants that are most
likely to influence Spike-hACE2 binding are those in the vicinity of the interaction interface, we
narrowed the list to the following 16 hACE2 variants: I21T, K26R, N33D, D38E, T55A, A65V,
W69C, T92V, T92I, Q102P, E329G, L351V, G377E, G377W, M383I, and P389H.

Structural modeling of mutations in SARS-CoV Spike/hACE2 complexes
For SARS-CoV, we used the X-ray crystallographic complexes in PDB ID 2AJF (resolution of 2.90
Å) and for SARS-CoV-2, cryo-EM complexes in 6M17 (resolution of 2.90 Å). Based on these
solved complexes, we modeled the S-hACE2 complex as the interaction between S RBD
(residues ~320 to ~520) and the N-terminal peptidase domain of ACE2 hACE2 domain (residues
~20 to 613). We do not model the effects of N glycans at two S RBD modification sites (331 and
343), which are outside of the binding interface38, as well as the hACE2 modification site at N90.
From the mutation lists for Spike and hACE2 proteins described above, we focused on those
mutations at the interaction interface since the effects of mutations are expected to diminish

with distance from the interface. The focused mutation sets consist of 42 Spike mutations and
16 hACE2 variants (Suppl. Figure 2). We generated point mutations using the mutate.pl
program in mmtsb package developed by Charles Brooks III’s laboratory. For each protein, the
algorithm rebuilds the structure for the new sequence using the original Cα and side chain
center positions while preserving the coordinates of unmutated residues. To avoid
perturbations introduced by structure refinement, we generated all mutations using the
experimentally solved structures. The reassembled binary complexes with mutations were then
refined using a local minimization (L-BFGS) algorithm as implemented in the Tinker package. To
ensure convergence, we use a cutoff rms gradient of 0.01 kcal/mol/Å or a maximum of 6000
iterations.
The binding free energy of a binary complex (∆G) is expressed as the difference between the
binding energies of the complex and its unbound components: ∆G = GSpike-hACE2 - GSpike - GhACE2.
This formula implies computing ∆G requires minimization of the binary complex and its
unbound components. To efficiently run hundreds of complexes, the minimizations were
computed in parallel. Computationally, ∆G, which is a function temperature (T) and ion
concentration (cion), is decomposed into different interaction types, ∆G(T,cion) = ∆Gsolvation +
∆Gvdw + ∆Gelectrostatics + ∆Gentropy. The ionic effects were computed using the Poisson-Boltzmann
equation solver APBS at cion=150mM NaCl and T=37°C. Electrostatic and entropy computations
required significantly more memory than minimization calculations. Additional computational
efficiency was achieved by separating the memory intensive computations from low-memory
calculations. Each complex typically took about 2-3 days on NYU Abu Dhabi’s Linux clusters. We
have previously reported some of above computational details and protocols23; 24.

Figures

Figure 1 Computational framework for predicting the effects of variants in the SARS-CoV-2
Spike/human ACE2 complex. (a) Top: SARS-CoV S-hACE2 complex showing key S interface
residues and mutations that play a role in cross-species adaptation to hACE2 (listed in table
below). Recognition of hACE2 by the S protein is centered at hACE2 residues K31 in the α1 helix
and K353 (highlighted in blue). Bottom: Known adaptations of selected S protein mutations. (b)
Computational workflow for structural assessment of variants in the S-hACE2 complex. First,
genetic variants are identified bioinformatically from publicly available genome sequence data.
Second, starting from their native conformations, mutations in 3D structures of component
proteins are generated and the mutant complex is then assembled and refined using an energy
minimization algorithm. Third, the binding affinity of each mutant S-hACE2 complex is
computed using physics-based interaction energies, including solvation, van der Waals,
electrostatics with ionic effects, and entropy. (c) Model of a wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 ShACE2 complex highlighting positions of modeled variants at the interface (spheres). Spike
residues, yellow; hACE2 residues, orange.

Figure 2 Comparison of measured and predicted affinities of Spike mutations. (a) Comparison
of measured association constants and predicted affinities of seven key SARS-CoV S mutations
and WT complex (PDB:2AJF, upper left panel); the fitted regression line has R2=0.61. (b)
Conformational changes induced by SARS-CoV S mutations shown in (a). Mutations L472F,
L472P and Y442F/L472F produced local conformational distortions at the interaction interface
(S-cyan, hACE2-green), whereas mutations Y442, N479K, D480G, and T487S do not structurally
perturb the wild-type complex (S, wheat; hACE2, yellow). Red arrows indicate structural
movements. (c) Predicted affinities of natural SARS-CoV-2 S variants that have low measured
infectivity levels relative to WT have significantly lower predicted affinities: -25.8 kcal/mol on
average (black line) versus -41.1 kcal/mol for WT (red line).

Figure 3 Affinities of interface variants in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike/human ACE2 complex. (a)
Binding affinity matrix for SARS-CoV-2 S-hACE2 complexes, representing all pairwise
combinations of 16 hACE2 variants and 42 S mutations. Each component protein has either zero
or one mutation. The affinity heatmap represents affinities normalized by that of the WT
complex (PDB: 6M17). Normalized affinities (relative to WT) are classified into four categories:
high-affinity (>1.2), WT-like (1±0.2), low-affinity (<0.8 but >0), and unbound (<0). (b)
Superimpositions of 31 high-affinity mutant S-hACE2 complexes. Highlighted are the associated
mutations in S (magenta spheres) and hACE2 (orange spheres), as well as hACE2 interaction
“hotspots” at K31 and K353 (blue spheres). On S protein, the high-affinity mutations form two
���� and ∆G
��������
clusters at opposite ends of its binding interface (dashed circles); ∆G
WT are mean
affinities of mutant and WT complexes, respectively. (c) Normalized mean affinities of hACE2
variants averaged over all S mutations. (d) Normalized mean affinities of S mutations averaged
over all hACE2 variants.

Figure 4 Conformational changes induced by high-affinity mutations. Local conformational
distortions induced by single Spike mutations N440K (a) and G476S (b) and their associated
normalized affinities. (c) Superimpositions of seven complexes with a mutation in each protein,
S(mut)-hACE2(mut) and the range of their normalized affinities. These double-mutant
complexes induced conformational changes (red arrows) in hACE2 α1 (labeled in blue font) and
loops in S (437-452, 494-507) to yield enhanced binding affinities. Color scheme: WT complex,
hACE2 in yellow and S in wheat; mutant complexes, hACE2 in green and S in cyan.

RBD superimposed with three neutralizing antibody structures (C121, 7K8X; C135, 7K8Z; STE90C11, 7B3O). Residues predicted to harbor high-affinity variants and fast-spreading mutations
are highlighted, illustrating that mutations in antibody binding sites have the potential to
reduce their efficacy. Bound C135 and STE90-C11 antibody structures partially overlap. (b)
Antibody escape of mutations as measured using the total escape fraction, i.e., the sum of all
