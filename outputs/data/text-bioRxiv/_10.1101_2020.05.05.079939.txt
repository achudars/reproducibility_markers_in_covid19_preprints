ABSTRACT
The rapid development of SARS-CoV-2 mediated COVID-19 pandemic has been the
cause of significant health concern, highlighting the immediate need for the effective
antivirals. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that has an inherent high mutation rate.
These mutations drive viral evolution and genome variability, thereby, facilitating
viruses to have rapid antigenic shifting to evade host immunity and to develop drug
resistance. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) perform viral genome
duplication and RNA synthesis. Therefore, we compared the available RdRp
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Indian isolates and ‘Wuhan wet sea food market
virus’ sequence to identify, if any, variation between them. We report seven
mutations observed in Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates and three unique mutations that
showed changes in the secondary structure of the RdRp protein at region of
mutation. We also studied molecular dynamics using normal mode analyses and
found that these mutations alter the stability of RdRp protein. Therefore, we propose
that RdRp mutations in Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates might have functional
consequences that can interfere with RdRp targeting pharmacological agents.

INTRODUCTION
SARS-CoV-2 (a member of Coronaviruses) outbreak occurred in Wuhan, China in
December 2019 and it became a pandemic by spreading to almost all countries
worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 disease that has created a global
public health problem. As of May 8, 2020, more than 3.9 million confirmed COVID-19
cases were reported worldwide with 0.27 million confirmed deaths. To design
antiviral therapeutics/ vaccines it is important to understand the genetic sequence,
structure and function of the viral proteins. When a virus tries to adapt to a new host,
in a new environment at a distinct geographical location, it makes necessary
changes in its genetic make-up to bring slight modifications in the nature of its
proteins(1). Such variations are known to helpviruses to exploit the host’s cellular
machinery that promotes its survival and proliferation. The β lymphocytes of host’s
adaptive immune system eventually identify the specific epitopes of the pathogenic
antigen and start producing protective antibodies, which in turn results in
agglutination and clearance of the pathogen(2–4). Being an efficient unique
pathogen, a virus, often mutate its proteins in a manner that it can still infect the host
cells, evading the host’s immune system. Even when fruitful strategies are

discovered and engaged, the high rate of genetic change displayed by viruses
frequently leads to drug resistance or vaccine escape(5).
The SARS-CoV-2 has a single stranded RNA genome of approximately 29.8Kb in
length and accommodates 14 ORFs encoding 29 proteins that includes four
structural proteins: Envelope (E), Membrane (M), Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike (S)
proteins, 16 non-structural proteins (nsp) and 9 accessory proteins(6),(7) including
the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (also named as nsp12). RdRp is
comprised of multiple distinct domains that catalyze RNA-template dependent
synthesis of phosphodiester bonds between ribonucleotides. The SARS-CoV-2
RdRp is the prime constituent of the replication/transcription machinery.The structure
of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp has recently been solved(8). This protein contains a “right
hand” RdRp domain (residues S367-F920), and a nidovirus-unique N-terminal
extension domain (residues D60-R249). The polymerase domain and N-terminal
domain are connected by an interface domain (residues A250-R365).
For RNA viruses, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) presents an ideal
target because of its vital role in RNA synthesis and absence of host homolog. RdRp
is therefore, a primary target for antiviral inhibitors such as Remdesivir(9) that is
being considered as a potential drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Since, RNA
viruses constantly evolve owing to the rapid rate of mutations in their genome, we
decided to analyse RdRp protein sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from different
geographical region to see if RdRp also mutate. Here, in the present study, we
identified and characterised three mutations in RdRp protein isolated from India
against that of the ‘Wuhan wet sea food market’(7) SARS-CoV-2. Altogether, our
data strongly suggests the prevalence of mutations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2
needs to be considered to develop new approaches for targeting this virus.

RESULTS:
Identification of mutations in RdRp protein present in Indian isolates
The SARS-COV-2 sequencing data was downloaded from NCBI (NCBI-Virus-SARSCoV-2 data hub). There are 26 SARS-CoV-2 sequences available from India. We
downloaded all Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences and Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 sequence,
which was deposited for the first time after COVID-19 cases started to appear in
Wuhan province, China. We downloaded protein sequence of NSP12/ RdRp from
the database. All these RdRp sequences were first aligned in CLUSTAL Omega to

check for similarities or differences. The Clustal Omega algorithm produces a
multiple sequence alignment by producing pairwise alignments. Using this algorithm,
we identified seven mutations in isolates from Indian SARS-CoV-2 samples
compared to Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 RdRp sequence as shown in figure 1. We
considered the original Wuhan sequence as the wild type for this comparison. These
mutations on RdRp are A97V, A185V, I201L, P323L, L329I, A466V and V880I
respectively. Out of these, one isolate (QJQ28357) have triple mutation, two isolates
(QJQ28429, QJQ28417) have double mutation, and rest have single mutations
(figure 1).

P323L mutation causes the alteration in secondary structure of RdRp
Next, we studied the effect of these mutations on secondary structure of RdRp. Our
data revealed that mutation at four positions have no effect in secondary structure
that includes I201L, L329I, A466V and V880I (figure 2 C, E, F and G). However,
mutation in rest of the three sites causes change in secondary structure (A97V,
A185V and P323L) as shown in figure 2 (panel A, B and D). At two positions (97 and
185) the alanine amino acid is substituted by valine. The valine side chain is larger
than alanine, and substitution of valine at position 97 and 185 impairs packing of the
protein as revealed by our secondary structure predications at these two sites (figure
2A and 2B, compare panel i and ii). Our analysis showed that there is addition of two
sheet at positions 97 and 98 due to mutation of A97V (figure 2A, compare panel i
and ii). Similarly, in A185V mutant, there is a loss of turn at 184 and replacement of
helix with sheet structure at 181, 182, 183 and 184 positions (figure 2B, compare
panel i and ii). Further, our secondary structure prediction also showed changes in
secondary structure when proline is substituted by leucine at 323 position (Figure 2D
and H, compare panel i and ii). The detailed analysis revealed that the mutant RdRp
(P323L) have attained considerable changes in secondary structure at the mutation
site. There is a loss of turn structures from position 323 and 324 and addition of five
sheets at positions 321, 322, 323, 324 and 327 (Figure 2D and H, highlighted in
green box). Proline possesses a unique property, its side chain cyclizes back on to
the backbone amide position, due to which it contributes to the secondary structure
formation because of its bulky pyrrolidine ring that places steric constraints on the
conformation of the preceding residue in the helix. The substitution of proline to
leucine in the mutant RdRp might result in loss of the structural integrity provided by

proline. Leucine is a hydrophobic amino acid and generally buried in the folded
protein structure. Altogether, the substitution of alanine to valine at position 97, 185
and proline to leucine at position 323 in mutant RdRp is changing the secondary
structure of the protein that might have functional consequences.

P323L alters the stability dynamics of tertiary structure of RdRp.
To correlate the reflection of changes in secondary structure, if any, in the dynamics
of the protein in its tertiary structure, we used DynaMut software(10) and performed
normal mode analyses and studied protein stability and flexibility. Our data revealed
that there is change in vibrational entropy energy (ΔΔSVibENCoM) between the wild
type (Wuhan isolate) and the mutant Indian isolate (Figure 3A).Vibration entropy
represents the major configurational-entropy contribution of proteins. By definition, it
is an average of the configurational entropies of the protein within single minima of
the energy landscape, weighted by their occupation probabilities(11). The negative

ΔΔSVibENCoM of mutant RdRp represents the rigidification of the protein structure
and positive ΔΔSVibENCoM represents gain in flexibility. Here, our data show that the
mutation at A185V and P323L lead to rigidification of mutant protein structure Figure
3B and D). However, the mutation at I201L leads to increase in flexibility (Figure 3C).
Further, we also calculated the free energy differences, ΔΔG, between wild-type and
mutant. The free energy differences, ΔΔG, caused by mutation have been correlated
with the structural changes, such as changes in packing density, cavity volume and
accessible surface area and therefore, it measures effect of mutation on protein
stability(12). In general, a ΔΔG below zero means that the mutation causes
destabilization and above zero represents protein stabilization. Here, our analysis
showed positive ΔΔG for A185V and P323L mutations suggesting that P323L
mutation is stabilising protein structure (Figure 3A); however, we observed negative

ΔΔG for I201L mutation indicating its destabilising behaviour (Figure 3A).
We further closely analysed the changes in the intramolecular interactions due to
these three mutations in RdRp. Our data showed that it is affecting the interactions
of the residues which are present in the close vicinity of alanine, isoleucine and
proline. The substitution of wild type residues with mutant residues alters the side
chain leading to change of intramolecular bonds in the pocket, where these amino
acid resides as shown in figure 4A, B and C. Therefore, it can be conclusively stated
that the three mutations namely, A97V, A185V and P323L, in large, are changing the

stability and intramolecular interactions in the protein that might have functional
consequences.

DISCUSSION
RNA viruses exploit all known mechanisms of genetic variation to ensure their
survival. Distinctive features of RNA virus replication include high mutation rates,
high yields, and short replication time (13). Mutation rates determine the amount of
genetic variation generated in a population, which is the material upon which natural
selection that can act (14). For this reason, a higher mutation rate correlates with a
higher evolutionary rate, subject to natural selection. The mutation rates also
determine the probability that a mutation conferring to drug resistance, antibody
escape, or expanded host range may arise (15). Additionally, mutation rates can
decide whether a virus population will become susceptible to drug-induced lethal
mutagenesis.
The SARS-CoV-2 infected humans from Wuhan province in China and quickly
spread to almost all countries worldwide. Since, this virus has already spread to
different demographic areas having different climatic condition, temperature,
humidity and seasonal variations; therefore, we can predict that this virus might be
mutating to adapt to new environments. Towards this, we investigated the mutations
in RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. We focused primarily on RdRp because it is an
indispensable protein of this virus that helps in its replication and transcription. More
importantly, there are many drugs which specifically target RdRp and are potent
antivirals. Our study reports the RdRp mutations present in the Indian isolates of
SARS-CoV-2 and, will help to understand the effect of variations on RdRp protein.
Our data demonstrate that A97V, A185V and P323Lmutations lead to significant
changes in the protein secondary structure (Figure 2). P323L mutation lies in the
interface domain (residues A250-R365) of the RdRp protein. This domain helps in
the coordination of N and C terminal domains of RdRp; therefore, a mutation in the
interface domain might have drastic impact on the function of RdRp. A recent virtual

Interestingly, the mutation identified in our study is very close to the docking site
(P323L and L329I). Therefore, it is reasonable that the substitution of these two
amino acids at 323 and 329 might interfere with the interaction of these drugs with
RdRp. Further, our data also revealed that P323L mutation is causing stabilisation of
the protein structure. The mutations in RdRp have already been linked to drug
resistance in different viruses. Such as a study on RdRp of influenza A virus
demonstrate that a K229R mutation confers resistance to favipiravir(16). Similarly,
mutation in hepatitis C virus RdRp at P495, P496 or V499 & T389 and have been
linked to drug resistance(17). Altogether, it is conceivable that many RNA viruses
acquire drug resistance through mutations in RdRp. However, the functional
characterisation of RdRp mutations investigated in our study needs to be carried out
to understand the exact role of these mutations. These variations might lead to virus
diversification and eventual emergence of variants or antibody escape mutants.
Therefore, elaborate studies on SARS-CoV-2 protein sequence variations needs to
be carried out that will help scientific community in better therapeutic targeting.

METHODS
Sequence retrieval:
We downloaded all SARS-CoV2 sequences from the NCBI virus database as shown
in table 1. As of now, there are 28 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from India have been
deposited in this database, out of which, two sequences are not complete; therefore,
we retrieved 26 datasets of SARS-CoV-2 (samples are from Indian). As a reference,
we downloaded the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 that was first reported genome
sequence deposited in the NCBI virus database from the ‘Wuhan wet sea food
market area’ from the early days of COVID-19 pandemic(7). This virus was formerly
called 'Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus having the accession number
YP_009724390.

Sequence alignments and structure:
All the RdRp protein sequences were aligned by multiple sequence alignment
platform of CLUSTAL Omega(18). Clustal Omega is a multiple sequence alignment
program that uses seeded guide trees and HMM profile-profile techniques to
generate alignments between three or more sequences. The alignment file was
carefully studied and differences in the amino acid changes were recorded.

Secondary structure predictions:
We used CFSSP(19) (Chou and Fasman secondary structure prediction), an online
server, to predict secondary structures of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp protein. This server
predicts the possibility of secondary structure such as alpha helix, beta sheet, and
turns from the amino acid sequence. CFSSP uses Chou-Fasman algorithm, which is
based on analyses of the relative frequencies of each amino acid in secondary
structures of proteins solved with X-ray crystallography.

RdRp dynamics study:
To investigate the effect of mutation on the RdRp protein structural conformation, its
molecular stability and flexibility, we used DynaMut software(10) (University of
Melbourne, Australia). To run this software we first downloaded the known protein
structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp from RCSB (PDB ID: 6M71(8)) and used it for
analysis. Next, the 6M71 structure was uploaded on DynaMut software and effect of
mutation in various protein structure stability parameters such as vibrational entropy;
the atomic fluctuations and deformation energies were determined. DynaMut, a web
server implements well established normal mode approaches that is used to analyse
and visualise protein dynamics. This software samples conformations and measures
the impact of mutations on protein dynamics and stability resulting from vibrational
entropy changes and also predicts the impact of a mutation on protein stability.
