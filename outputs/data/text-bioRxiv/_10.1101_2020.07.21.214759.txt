Abstract
Neutralizing antibodies elicited by prior infection or vaccination are likely to be key for future
protection of individuals and populations against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, passively
administered antibodies are among the most promising therapeutic and prophylactic anti-SARSCoV-2 agents. However, the degree to which SARS-CoV-2 will adapt to evade neutralizing
antibodies is unclear. Using a recombinant chimeric VSV/SARS-CoV-2 reporter virus, we show
that functional SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants with mutations in the receptor binding domain
(RBD) and N-terminal domain that confer resistance to monoclonal antibodies or convalescent
plasma can be readily selected. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 S variants that resist commonly elicited
neutralizing antibodies are now present at low frequencies in circulating SARS-CoV-2
populations. Finally, the emergence of antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants that might limit
the therapeutic usefulness of monoclonal antibodies can be mitigated by the use of antibody
combinations that target distinct neutralizing epitopes.

Introduction
Neutralizing antibodies are a key component of adaptive immunity against many viruses
that can be elicited by natural infection or vaccination (1). Antibodies can also be administered
as recombinantly produced proteins or as convalescent plasma to confer a state of passive
immunity in prophylactic or therapeutic settings. These paradigms are of particular importance
given the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and the devastating COVID19 pandemic that has
ensued. Indeed, interventions to interrupt SAR-CoV-2 replication and spread are urgently
sought, and passively administered antibodies are currently among the most promising
therapeutic and prophylactic antiviral agents. Moreover, an understanding of the neutralizing
antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for the elicitation of effective and durable immunity
by vaccination (2).
Recent studies have shown that related, potently neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that
recognize the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) are often elicited in SARS-CoV-2
infection (3-17). These antibodies have great potential to be clinically impactful in the treatment
and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The low levels of somatic hypermutation and
repetitive manner in which similar antibodies (e.g. those based on IGHV3-53 (3, 18, 19) have
been isolated from COVID19 convalescents suggests that potently neutralizing responses
should be readily elicited. Paradoxically, a significant fraction of COVID19 convalescents,
including some from whom potent neutralizing antibodies have been cloned, exhibit low levels of
plasma neutralizing activity (3, 20, 21). Together, these findings suggest that natural SARSCoV-2 infection may often fail to induce sufficient B-cell expansion and maturation to generate
high titer neutralizing antibodies.
The degree to, and pace at which SARS-CoV-2 might evolve to escape neutralizing
antibodies is unclear. The aforementioned considerations raise the possibility that SARS-CoV-2
evolution might be influenced by frequent encounters with sub-optimal concentrations of
potently neutralizing antibodies during natural infection. Moreover, the widespread use of

convalescent plasma containing unknown, and often suboptimal, levels of neutralizing
antibodies might also increase the acquisition of neutralizing antibody resistance by circulating
SARS-CoV-2 populations (22, 23). Reinfection of previously infected individuals who have
incomplete or waning serological immunity might similarly drive emergence of antibody escape
variants. As human neutralizing antibodies are discovered and move into clinical development
as therapeutics and prophylactics, and immunogens based on prototype SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein sequences are deployed as vaccines, it is important to anticipate patterns of antibody
resistance that might arise. Here, we describe a recombinant chimeric virus approach that can
rapidly generate and evaluate SARS-CoV-2 S mutants that escape antibody neutralization. We
show that mutations conferring resistance to convalescent plasma or RBD-specific monoclonal
antibodies can be readily generated in vitro. Notably, these antibody resistance mutations are
present at low frequency in natural populations. Importantly, the use of candidate monoclonal
antibody combinations that target distinct epitopes on the RBD (and therefore have nonoverlapping resistance mutations) can suppress the emergence of antibody resistance.

Results
Selection of SARS-CoV-2 S variants using a replication competent VSV/SARS-CoV-2
chimeric virus
To select SARS-CoV-2 S variants that escape neutralization by antibodies, we used a
recently described replication-competent chimeric virus based on vesicular stomatitis virus that
encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and green fluorescent protein (rVSV/SARS-CoV2/GFP) (24). Notably, rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP replicates rapidly and to high titers (107 to 108
PFU/ml within 48h), mimics the SARS-CoV-2 requirement for ACE-2 as a receptor, and is
neutralized by COVID19 convalescent plasma and SARS-CoV-2 S-specific human monoclonal
antibodies (24). The replication of rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP can be readily monitored and
measured by GFP fluorescence and the absence of proof-reading activity in the viral

polymerase (VSV-L) results in the generation of virus stocks with greater diversity than
authentic SARS-CoV-2, for an equivalent viral population size. These features facilitate
experiments to investigate the ability S protein variants to escape antibody neutralization.
We used two adapted, high-titer variants of rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP, (namely
rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP1D7 and rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP2E1) (24) in attempts to derive antibodyresistant mutants. Virus populations containing 1x106 infectious particles were incubated with
antibodies to neutralize susceptible variants (Figure 1A). For monoclonal antibodies, viral
populations were incubated with antibodies at 5 μg/ml or 10μg/ml, (~1000 to 10,000 x IC50). For
plasma samples, viruses were incubated with a range of plasma dilutions (see materials and
methods). Neutralized viral populations were then applied to 293T/ACE2(B) cells (24), which
support robust rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP replication and incubated for 48hr. We used three
potent human monoclonal antibodies C121, C135 and C144 (3), that are candidates for clinical
development (Table 1). In addition, we used four convalescent plasma samples, three of which
were from the same donors from which C121, C135 and C144, were obtained (3) (Table 1).
Two of these plasmas (COV-47 and COV-72) were potently neutralizing while the third (COV107) had low neutralizing activity. A fourth convalescent plasma sample (COV-NY) was potently
neutralizing but did not have a corresponding monoclonal antibody (Table 1).
Infection with rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP in the presence of the monoclonal antibodies
C121 or C144 reduced the number of infectious units from 106 to a few hundred, as estimated
by the frequency of GFP-positive cells (Figure 1B) a reduction of >1,000 fold. C135 reduced
infection by ~100 fold. Imaging of wells infected with rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP in the presence of
C121 or C144 revealed a small number of foci (~10 to 20/well), that suggested viral spread
following initial infection (Figure 1B). In the case of C135, a greater number of GFP-positive
cells were detected, obscuring the visualization of focal viral spread following initial infection.
Aliquots of supernatants from these passage-1 (p1) cultures were collected 48h after infection,
diluted in the same concentrations of monoclonal antibodies that were initially employed, and

used to infect fresh (p2) cultures (Figure 1A). For p2 cultures, almost all cells became infected
within 48h, suggesting the possible outgrowth of monoclonal antibody escape variants that were
present in the original viral populations.
For selection in the presence of plasma, p1 supernatants were harvested at 48h after
infection in the presence of the highest concentrations of plasma that permitted infection of
reasonable numbers (approximately 10%) of cells. Then, p2 cultures were established using p1
supernatants, diluted in the same concentrations of plasma used in p1. This approach led to
clear ‘escape’ for the COV-NY plasma with prolific viral growth in p2 as evidenced by a large
increase in the number of GFP positive cells. For COV-47, COV-72 and CO107, plasma clearly
retained at least some inhibitory activity in p2. Thereafter, p3 cultures and p4 cultures were
established for COV-47, COV-72 and COV-107 plasmas at 5-fold higher concentrations of
plasma than were used in p1 and p2 cultures (Figure 1A).
RNA was extracted from p2 supernatants (monoclonal antibodies and COV-NY plasma)
as well as later passages for the COV-47, COV-72 and COV-107 plasma selections. Sequences
encoding either the RBD or the complete S protein were amplified using PCR and analyzed by
Sanger and/or Illumina sequencing. For all three monoclonal antibodies and two of the four
plasmas, sequence analyses revealed clear evidence for selection, with similar or identical
mutants emerging in the presence of monoclonal antibodies or plasma in both rVSV/SARSCoV-2/GFP1D7 and rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP2E1 cultures (Figure 2A-D, Figure 2 - supplement
1A, B, Figure 2 - supplement 2A, B, Table 2). In the case of C121, mutations E484K and
Q493K/R within the RBD were present at high frequencies in both p2 selected populations, with
mutation at a proximal position (F490L) present in one p2 population (Figure 2A, Table 2).
Viruses passaged in the presence of monoclonal antibody C144 also had mutations at positions
E484 and Q493, but not at F490 (Figure 2C, Table 2). In contrast, virus populations passaged
in the presence of monoclonal antibody C135 lacked mutations at E484 or Q493, and instead
had mutations R346K/S/L and N440K at high frequency (Figure 2C, Table 2).

Mutations at specific positions were enriched in viruses passaged in the presence of
convalescent plasma, in 2 out of 4 cases (Figure 2 - supplement 1A, B, Figure 2 supplement 2A, B, Table 2). Specifically, virus populations passaged in the presence of COVNY plasma had mutations within RBD encoding sequence (K444R/N/Q and V445E) that were
abundant at p2 (Figure 2 - supplement 2A, B, Table 2). Conversely, mutations outside the
RBD, specifically at N148S, K150R/E/T/Q and S151P in the N-terminal domain (NTD) were
present at modest frequency in COV-47 p2 cultures and became more abundant at p3 and p4
(Figure 2 - supplement 1A, B, Table 2). Replication in the presence of COV72 or COV107
plasma did not lead to the clear emergence of escape mutations, suggesting that the
neutralization by these plasmas was not due to one dominant antibody specificity. In the case of
COV107, the failure of escape mutants to emerge may simply be due to the lack of potency of
that plasma (Table 1). However, in the case of COV-72, combinations of antibodies may be
responsible for the potent neutralizing properties of the plasma in that case.

Isolation and characterization of rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP antibody escape mutants
Based on the aforementioned analyses, supernatants from C121, C144, and C135 and
COV-NY plasma p2 cultures, or COV47 p4 cultures, contained mixtures of putative rVSV/SARSCoV-2/GFP neutralization escape mutants. To isolate individual mutants, the supernatants were
serially diluted and individual viral foci isolated by limiting dilution in 96 well plates. Numerous
individual rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP1D7 and rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP2E1 derivatives were
harvested from wells containing a single virus plaque, expanded on 293T/ACE2(B) cells, then
RNA was extracted and subjected to Sanger sequencing (Figure 3 - supplement 1). This
process verified the purity of the individual rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP variants and yielded a
number of viral mutants for further analysis (Figure 3 - supplement 1). These mutants all
encoded single amino-acid substitutions in S-coding sequences that corresponded to variants
found at varying frequencies (determined by Illumina sequencing) in the parental viral

populations. Notably, each of the isolated rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP mutants replicated with
similar kinetics to the parental rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP1D7 and rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP2E1
viruses (Figure 3A), suggesting that the mutations that emerged during replication in the
presence of monoclonal antibodies or plasma did not confer a substantial loss of fitness, at least
in the context of rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP. Moreover, for mutants in RBD sequences that arose
in the C121, C135, C144 and COV-NY cultures, each of the viral mutants retained
approximately equivalent sensitivity to neutralization by an ACE2-Fc fusion protein, suggesting
little or no change in interaction with ACE2 (Figure 3B).
We next determined the sensitivity of the isolated RBD mutants to neutralization by the
three monoclonal antibodies. The E484K and Q493R mutants that emerged during replication in
the presence of C121 or C144, both caused apparently complete, or near complete, resistance
to both antibodies (IC50 >10 μg/ml, Figure 4A, B). However, both of these mutants retained full
sensitivity (IC50 <10 ng/ml) to C135. Conversely, the R346S and N440K mutants that emerged
during replication in the presence of C135 were resistant to C135, but retained full sensitivity to
both C121 and C144 (Figure 4A, B). The K444N, K444T, V445G, V445E and V445L mutants
that arose during replication the presence of COV-NY plasma conferred partial resistance to
C135, with IC50 values ranging from 25ng/ml to 700ng/ml, but these mutants retained full
sensitivity to both C121 and C144 (Figure 4A, B). The spatial distribution of these resistanceconferring mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD surface suggested the existence of both
distinct and partly overlapping neutralizing epitopes on the RBD (Figure 4C). The C121 and
C144 neutralizing epitopes appear to be similar, and include E484 and Q493, while a clearly
distinct conformational epitope seems to be recognized by C135, that includes R346 and N440
residues. Antibodies that constitute at last part of the neutralizing activity evident in COV-NY
plasma appear to recognize an epitope that includes and K444 and V445. The ability of
mutations at these residues to confer partial resistance to C135 is consistent with their spatial
proximity to the C135 conformational epitope (Figure 4C).

To test whether neutralization escape mutations conferred loss of binding to the
monoclonal antibodies, we expressed conformationally prefusion-stabilized S trimers (25),
appended at their C-termini with NanoLuc luciferase (Figure 5A). The S-trimers were incubated
in solution with the monoclonal antibodies, complexes were captured using protein G magnetic
beads, and the amount of S-trimer captured was measured using NanoLuc luciferase assays
(Figure 5A). As expected, C121, C135 and C144 monoclonal antibodies all bound the WT S
trimer (Figure 5B). The E484K and Q493R trimers exhibited complete, or near complete loss of
binding to C121 and C144 antibodies but retained WT levels of binding to C135 (Figure 5B).
Conversely, the R346S and N440K mutants exhibited complete loss of binding to C135, but
retained WT levels of binding to C121 and C144. The K444N and V445E mutants retained near
WT levels of binding to all three antibodies, despite exhibiting partial resistance to C135 (Figure
5A, B). Presumably the loss of affinity of these mutants for C135 was sufficient to impart partial
neutralization resistance but insufficient to abolish binding in the solution binding assay.
Analysis of mutants that were isolated from the virus population that emerged during
rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP replication in the presence of COV-47 plasma (specifically N148S,
K150R, K150E, S151P) revealed that these mutants exhibited specific resistance to COV-47
plasma. Indeed, the COV-47 plasma NT50 for these mutants was reduced by 8- to 10-fold
(Figure 6A). This finding indicates that the antibody or antibodies responsible for majority of
neutralizing activity in COV-47 plasma target an NTD epitope that includes amino acids 148151, even though the highly potent monoclonal antibody (C144) isolated from COV-47 targets
the RBD. Mutants in the 148-151 NTD epitope exhibited marginal reductions in sensitivity to
other plasmas (Figure 6A), indicating that different epitopes are targeted by plasmas from the
other donors.
The viral population that emerged during replication in COV-NY plasma yielded mutants
K444N or T and V445G, E or L. Each of these mutations conferred substantial resistance to
neutralization by COV-NY plasma, with ~10- to 30-fold reduction in NT50 (Figure 6B). Thus, the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.21.214759; this version posted July 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

dominant neutralizing activity in COV-NY plasma is represented by an antibody or antibodies
recognizing an RBD epitope that includes K444 and V445. As was the case with COV-47
resistant mutants, viruses encoding the mutations conferring resistance to COV-NY plasma
retained almost full sensitivity to neutralization by other plasmas (Figure 6B).
Interestingly, the mutations that conferred complete or near complete resistance to the
potent RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies C121, C135 and C144 conferred little or no
resistance to neutralization by plasma from the same individual, or other individuals (Figure
6C). These RBD-specific antibodies represent the most potent monoclonal antibodies isolated
from COV-47, COV-72 and COV-107, respectively, but the retention of plasma sensitivity by the
monoclonal antibody-resistant mutants suggests that these antibodies contribute little to the
overall neutralization activity of plasma from the same individual. This finding is consistent with
the observation that memory B cells producing these antibodies are rare (3), and with the
results of the selection experiments in which rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP replication in the
presence of COV-47, COV-72 and COV-107 plasma did not enrich for mutations that
correspond to the neutralization epitopes targeted by the monoclonal antibodies obtained from
these individuals (Figure 2 - supplement 1A,B, Figure 2 - supplement 2A,B. Table 2).
Overall, analysis of even this limited set of monoclonal antibodies and plasmas shows that
potent neutralization can be conferred by antibodies that target diverse SARS-CoV-2 epitopes.
Moreover, the most potently neutralizing antibodies generated in a given COVID19
convalescent individual may contribute in only a minor way to the overall neutralizing antibody
response in that same individual.

Natural occurrence of antibody-resistance RBD mutations
The aforementioned neutralizing antibody escape mutations were artificially generated
during in vitro replication of a recombinant virus. However, as monoclonal antibodies are
developed for therapeutic and prophylactic applications, and vaccine candidates are deployed,

and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection becomes greater, it is important both to
understand pathways of antibody resistance and to monitor the prevalence of resistance
conferring mutations in naturally circulating SARS-CoV-2 populations.
To survey the natural occurrence of mutations that might confer resistance to the
monoclonal and plasma antibodies used in our experiments we used the GISAID (26) and CoVGlue (27) SARS-CoV-2 databases. Among the 55,189 SARS-CoV-2 sequences in the CoV2Glue database at the time of writing, 2175 different non-synonymous mutations were present in
natural populations of SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequences. Consistent with the finding that none
of the mutations that arose in our selection experiments gave an obvious fitness deficit (in the
context of rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP), most were also present in natural viral populations.
For phenotypic analysis of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 S mutations, we focused on
the ACE2 interface of the RBD, as it is the target of most therapeutic antibodies entering clinical
development (3, 17, 28), and is also the target of at least some antibodies present in
convalescent plasmas. In addition to the mutations that arose in our antibody selection
experiments, inspection of circulating RBD sequences revealed numerous naturally occurring
mutations in the vicinity of the ACE2 binding site and the epitopes targeted by the antibodies

(https://www.gisaid.org, http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk) (Figure 7A-D). We tested nearly all of the
mutations that are present in the GISAID database as of June 2020, in the proximity of the
ACE2 binding site and neutralizing epitopes, for their ability to confer resistance to the
monoclonal antibodies, using an HIV-1-based pseudotyped virus-based assay (Figure 7A-C).
Consistent with, and extending our findings with rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP, naturally occurring
mutations at positions E484, F490, Q493, and S494 conferred complete or partial resistance to
C121 and C144 (Figure 7A, C). While there was substantial overlap in the mutations that
caused resistance to C121 and C144, there were also clear differences in the degree to which
certain mutations (e.g. G446, L455R/I/F, F490S/L) affected sensitivity to the two antibodies.

Naturally occurring mutations that conferred complete or partial resistance to C135 were at
positions R346, N439, N440, K444, V445 and G446. In contrast to the C121/C144 epitope,
these amino acids are peripheral to the ACE2 binding site on the RBD (Figure 7D). Indeed, in
experiments where the binding of a conformationally stabilized trimeric S-NanoLuc fusion
protein to 293T/ACE2cl.22 cells was measured, preincubation of S-NanoLuc with a molar
excess of C121 or C144 completely blocked binding (Figure 7E). Conversely, preincubation
with C135 only partly blocked binding to 293T/ACE2cl.22 cells, consistent with the finding that
the C135 conformational epitope does not overlap the ACE2 binding site (Figure 7D). C135
might inhibit S-ACE-2 binding by steric interference with access to the ACE 2 binding site.
These results are also consistent with experiments which indicated that C135 does not compete
with C121 and C144 for binding to the RBD (3).
All of the mutations that were selected in our rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP antibody selection
experiments as well as other mutations that confer resistance to C121, C144 or C135 are found
in naturally circulating SARS-CoV-2 populations at very low frequencies (Figure 8). With one
exception (N439K) that is circulating nearly exclusively in Scotland and is present in ~1% of
COV-Glue database sequences, (and whose frequency may be overestimated due to regional
oversampling) all antibody resistance mutations uncovered herein are present in global SARSCoV-2 at frequencies of <1 in 1000 sequences (Figure 8). The frequency with which the
resistance mutations are present in naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 sequences appeared
rather typical compared to other S mutations, with the caveat that sampling of global SARSCoV-2 is nonrandom. Therefore, these observations do not provide evidence that the
neutralizing activities exhibited by the monoclonal antibodies or plasma samples used herein
have driven strong selection of naturally circulating SARS-CoV-2 sequences thus far (Figure 8).

Selection of combinations of monoclonal antibodies for therapeutic and prophylactic
applications.

The ability of SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies and plasma to select variants that are
apparently fit and that naturally occur at low frequencies in circulating viral populations suggests
that therapeutic use of single antibodies might select for escape mutants. To mitigate against
the emergence or selection of escape mutations during therapy, or during population-based
prophylaxis, we tested whether combinations of monoclonal antibodies could suppress the
emergence of resistant variants during in vitro selection experiments. Specifically, we repeated
antibody selection experiments in which rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP populations containing 106
infectious virions were incubated with 10μg/ml of each individual monoclonal antibody, or
mixtures containing 5μg/ml of each of two antibodies (Figure 9). C121 and C144 target largely
overlapping epitopes, and mutations conferring resistance to one of these antibodies generally
conferred resistance to the other (Figure 6). Therefore, we used mixtures of antibodies
targeting clearly distinct epitopes (C121+C135 and C144+C135). As previously, replication of
rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP in the presence of a single monoclonal antibody enabled the formation
of infected foci in p1 cultures (Figure 9A-C), that rapidly expanded and enabled the emergence
of apparently resistant virus populations. Indeed, rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP yields from p2
cultures established with one antibody (C121, C135 or C144) were indistinguishable from those
established with no antibody (Figure 9D). Conversely, rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP replication in
the presence of mixtures of C121+C135 or C144+C135 led to sparse infection of individual cells
in p1 cultures, but there was little or no formation of foci that would suggest propagation of
infection from these infected cells (Figure 9A-C), Therefore, it is likely that infected cells arose
from rare, non-neutralized, virions that retained sensitivity to at least one of the antibodies in
mixture. Consequently, viral spread was apparently completely suppressed and no replication
competent rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP was detected in p2 cultures established with mixtures of the
two antibodies (Figure 9D).

Discussion
The degree to which resistance will impact effectiveness of antibodies in SARS-CoV-2
therapeutic and vaccine settings is currently unclear (28). Notably, the inter-individual variation
in SARS-CoV-2 sequences is low compared to many other RNA viruses, in part because
coronaviruses encode a 3’-5’ exonuclease activity. The exonuclease activity provides a
proofreading function the enhances replication fidelity and limits viral sequence diversification
(29).
However, replication fidelity is but one of several variables that affect viral population
diversity. One determinant of total viral diversity is population size. Many millions of individuals
have been infected by SARS-CoV-2, and a single swab from an infected individual can contain
in excess of 109 copies of viral RNA (30). It follows that SARS-CoV-2 genomes encoding every
possible single amino-acid substitution are present in the global population, and perhaps in a
significant fraction of individual COVID19 patients. Thus, the frequency with which particular
variants occur in the global SARS-CoV-2 population is strongly influenced by the frequency with
which negative and positive selection pressures that favor their propagation are encountered, as
well as founder effects at the individual patient and population levels.
Fitness effects of mutations will obviously vary and will suppress the prevalence of
deleterious mutations. However, otherwise neutral, or even modestly deleterious, mutations will
rise in prevalence if they confer escape from selective pressures, such as immune responses.
Notably, the neutralizing antibody escape mutations described herein did not detectably alter
rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP replication, did not affect ACE2-Fc sensitivity and were found in natural
populations at unexceptional frequencies, consistent with the notion that they do not have large
effects on fitness in the absence of neutralizing antibodies. The prevalence of neutralizing
antibody escape mutations will also be strongly influenced by the frequency with which SARSCoV-2 encounters neutralizing antibodies. Peak viral burden in swabs and sputum, which likely
corresponds to peak infectiousness and frequency of transmission events, appears to

approximately correspond with the onset of symptoms, and clearly occurs before
seroconversion (30). Thus, it is quite likely that most transmission events involve virus
populations that are yet to experience antibody-imposed selective pressure in the transmitting
individual. Such a scenario would reduce the occurrence of antibody escape mutations in
natural viral populations. It will be interesting to determine whether viral sequences obtained late
in infection are more diverse or have evidence of immunological escape mutations.
There are situations that are anticipated to increase the frequency of encounters
between SARS-CoV-2 and antibodies that could impact the emergence of antibody resistance.
Millions of individuals have already been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and among them,
neutralizing antibody titers are extremely variable (3, 20, 21). It is plausible that those with weak
immune responses or waning immunity can become re-infected, and if so, that encounters
between SARS-CoV-2 and pre-existing but incompletely protective neutralizing antibodies might
drive the selection of escape variants. In a similar manner, poorly immunogenic vaccine
candidates, convalescent plasma therapy, and suboptimal monoclonal antibody treatment,
particularly monotherapy(28), could create conditions to drive the acquisition of resistance to
commonly occurring antibodies in circulating virus populations.
The extent to which SARS-CoV-2 evasion of individual antibody responses would have
pervasive effects on the efficacy of vaccines and monoclonal antibody treatment/therapy will
also be influenced by the diversity of neutralizing antibody responses within and between
individuals. Analysis of potent neutralizing antibodies cloned by several groups indicates that
potent neutralizing antibodies are commonly elicited, and very similar antibodies, such as those
containing IGHV3-53 and IGHV3-66 can be found in different individuals (3, 18, 19). These
findings imply a degree of homogeneity the among neutralizing antibodies that are generated in
different individuals. Nevertheless, each of the four convalescent plasma tested herein had
distinct neutralizing characteristics. In two of the four plasma tested, selection experiments
suggested that a dominant antibody specificity was responsible for a significant fraction of the

neutralizing capacity of the plasma. Nevertheless, the failure of single amino acid substitutions
to confer complete resistance to any plasma strongly suggests the existence of multiple
neutralizing specificities in each donor. The techniques described herein could be adapted to
broadly survey the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing specificities in many plasma samples
following natural infection or vaccination, enabling a more complete picture of the diversity of
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses to be developed. Indeed, the approach described
herein can be used to map epitopes of potent neutralizing antibodies rapidly and precisely. It
has an advantage over other epitope mapping approaches (such as array-based oligo-peptide
scanning or random site-directed mutagenesis), in that selective pressure acts solely on the
naturally formed, fusion-competent viral spike. While mutations outside the antibody binding
sites might lead to resistance, the functional requirement will prohibit mutations that simply
disrupt the native conformation. Indeed, we found that selective constraints caused escape
variants to maintain replicative fitness.
Human monoclonal antibodies targeting both the NTD and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 have
been isolated, with those targeting RBD being especially potent. As these antibodies are used
clinically (17, 28), in therapeutic and prophylactic modes, it will be important to identify
resistance mutations and monitor their prevalence in a way that is analogous to antiviral and
antibiotic resistance monitoring in other infectious diseases. Moreover, as is shown herein, the
selection of antibody mixtures with non-overlapping escape mutations should reduce the
emergence of resistance and prolong the utility of antibody therapies in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Materials and Methods
Plasmid constructs
A replication competent rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP chimeric virus clone, encoding the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein lacking the C-terminal 18 codons in place of G, as well as GFP
immediately upstream of the L (polymerase) has been previously described (24). The pHIV-

1NLGagPol and pCCNG/nLuc constructs that were used to generate SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped
particles have been previously described (24). The pSARS-CoV-2 protein expression plasmid
containing a C-terminally truncated SARS-CoV-2 S protein (pSARS-CoV-2Δ19) containing a
synthetic human-codon optimized cDNA (Geneart) has been previously described (24) and was
engineered to include BamHI, MfeI, BlpI and AgeI restriction enzyme sites flanking sequences
encoding the RBD. Gibson assembly was used to introduce mutant RBD sequences into this
plasmid, that were generated synthetically (g/eBlocks IDT) or by overlap extension PCR with
primers that incorporated the relevant nucleotide substitutions.
Cell lines
HEK-293T cells and derivatives were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37oC and 5% CO2. All cell lines
have been tested negative for contamination with mycoplasma. Derivatives expressing ACE2
were generated by transducing 293T cells with CSIB(ACE2) vector and the uncloned bulk
population 293T/ACE2(B) or a single-cell clone 293T/ACE2.cl22 (24) were used.
Replication competent VSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP chimeric virus
The generation of infectious rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP chimeric viruses stocks has been
previously described (24). Two plaque purified variants designated rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP1D7
and rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP2E1 that encode F157S/R685M (1D7) and D215G/R683G (2E1)
substitutions were used in these studies.

HIV-1/CCNanoLuc2AEGFP-SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype particles
The HIV-1/NanoLuc2AEGFP-SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virions were generated as
previously described (24). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with pHIVNLGagPol,
pCCNanoLuc2AEGFP and a WT or mutant SARS-CoV-2 expression plasmid (pSARS-CoV2Δ19) using polyethyleneimine. At 48h after transfection, the supernatant was harvested,
clarified, filtered, aliquoted and stored at -80oC.
Infectivity assays
To measure the infectivity of pseudotyped or chimeric viral particles, viral stocks were
serially diluted and 100µl of each dilution added to 293T/ACE2cl.22 target cells plated at 1x104
cells/well in 100 µl medium in 96-well plates the previous day. Cells were then cultured for 48h

hours (HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses) or 16h (replication competent rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP),
unless otherwise indicated, and then photographed or harvested for NanoLuc luciferase or flow
cytometry assays.
Selection of viruses in the presence of antibodies
For selection of viruses resistant to plasma or monoclonal antibodies, rVSV/SARS-CoV2/GFP1D7 and rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP2E1 populations containing 106 infectious particles were
incubated with dilutions of monoclonal antibodies (10µg/ml, 5µg/ml) or COVID19 plasma (1:50,
1:250, 1:500) for 1h at 37˚C. Then, the virus antibody mixtures were incubated with 2x105
293T/ACE2(B) cells in 12 well plates. Two days later, the cells were imaged and supernatant
from the wells containing the highest concentration of plasma or monoclonal antibodies that
showed evidence of viral replication (GFP positive foci) or large numbers of GFP positive cells
was harvested. A 100µl of the cleared supernatant was incubated with the same dilution of
plasma or monoclonal antibody and then used to infect 2x105 293T/ACE2(B) cells in 12 well
plates, as before. rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP1D7 and rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP2E1 were passaged in
the presence of C121 or C144 two times before complete escape was apparent. rVSV/SARSCoV-2/GFP1D7 and rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP2E1 were passaged with C135 or plasma samples up
to 5 times.
To isolate individual mutant viruses, selected rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP1D7 and
rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP2E1 populations were serially diluted in medium without antibodies and
individual viral variants isolated by visualizing single GFP-positive plaques at limiting dilutions in
96-well plates containing 1x104 293T/ACE2(B) cells. These plaque purified viruses were
expanded, and further characterized using sequencing, spreading replication and neutralization
assays.
Sequence analyses
For the identification of putative antibody resistance mutations, RNA was isolated from aliquots
of supernatant containing selected viral populations or individual plaque purified variants using
Trizol-LS. The purified RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using random hexamer
primers and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US). The cDNA was
amplified using Phusion (NEB, US) and primers flanking RBD encoding sequences.
Alternatively, a fragment including the entire S-encoding sequence was amplified using primers
targeting VSV-M and VSV-L. The PCR products were gel-purified and sequenced either using
Sanger-sequencing or NGS as previously described (31). Briefly, 1 µl of diluted DNA was used

for the tagmentation reactions with 0.25 µl Nextera TDE1 Tagment DNA enzyme (catalog no.
15027865), and 1.25 µl TD Tagment DNA buffer (catalog no. 15027866; Illumina).
Subsequently, the DNA was ligated to unique i5/i7 barcoded primer combinations using the
Illumina Nextera XT Index Kit v2 and KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (2X; KAPA Biosystems)
and purified using AmPure Beads XP (Agencourt), after which the samples were pooled into
one library and subjected to paired-end sequencing using Illumina MiSeq Nano 300 V2 cycle
kits (Illumina) at a concentration of 12pM.
For analysis of NGS data, the raw paired-end reads were pre-processed to remove adapter
sequences and trim low-quality reads (Phred quality score <20) using BBDuk. Filtered reads
were mapped to the codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 S sequence in rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP
using Geneious Prime (Version 2020.1.2). Mutations were annotated using Geneious Prime,
with a P-value cutoff of 10-6. Information regarding RBD-specific variant frequencies, their
corresponding P-values, and read depth were compiled using the Python programming
language (version 3.7) running pandas (1.0.5), numpy (1.18.5), and matplotlib (3.2.2).
Neutralization assays
To measure neutralizing antibody activity in plasma, serial dilutions of plasma beginning
with a 1:12.5 or a 1:100 (for plasma COV-NY) initial dilution were five-fold serially diluted in 96well plates over six or eight dilutions. For monoclonal antibodies, the initial dilution started at
40µg/ml. Thereafter, approximately 5x104 infectious units of rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP or 5x103
infectious units of HIV/CCNG/nLuc/SARS-CoV-2 were mixed with the plasma or mAb at a 1:1
ratio and incubated for 1 hour at 37oC in a 96-well plate. The mixture was then added to
293T/ACE2cl.22 target cells plated at 1x104 cells/well in 100 µl medium in 96-well plates the
previous day. Thus, the final starting dilutions were 1:50 or 1:400 (for COV-NY) for plasma and
10µg/ml for monoclonal antibodies. Cells were then cultured for 16h (for rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP)
or 48h (for HIV/CCNG/nLuc/SARS-CoV-2). Thereafter, cells were harvested for flow cytometry or
NanoLuc luciferase assays.
Antibody binding and ACE2 binding inhibition assay
A conformationally stabilized (6P) version of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein(25), appended at
its C-terminus with a trimerization domain, a GGSGGn spacer sequence, NanoLuc luciferase,
Strep-tag, HRV 3C protease cleavage site and 8XHis (S-6P-NanoLuc) was expressed and
purified from the supernatant of 293T Expi cells. Mutants thereof were also expressed and purifies

following substitution of sequences encoding the RBD that originated from the unmodified Sexpression plasmids
For antibody binding assays, 20ng, 40ng, or 80ng S-6P-NanoLuc (or mutants thereof)
were mixed with 100ng of antibodies, C121, C135, or C144, \ diluted in LI-COR Intercept blocking
buffer, in a total volume of 60μl/well in 96-well plate. After a 30 min incubation, 10ul protein G
magnetic beads was added to each well and incubated for 1.5 hr. The beads were then washed
3 times and incubated with 30ul lysis buffer (Promega). Then 15μl of the lysate was used to
measure bound NanoLuc activity.
For ACE2-binding inhibition assays, 20ng of S-6P-NanoLuc was mixed with 100ng of
antibodies, C121, C135 or C144, diluted in 3% goat serum/PBS, in a total volume of 50μl. After
30 minutes incubation, the mixture was incubated with 1x105 293T cells, or 293T/ACE2cl.22 cells
for 2 hours at 4oC. The cells were then washed 3 times and lysed with 30μl lysis buffer and 15μl
of the lysate was used to measure bound NanoLuc activity.
Reporter gene assays
For the NanoLuc luciferase assays, cells were washed gently, twice with PBS and lysed
in Lucifersase Cell culture Lysis reagent (Promega). NanoLuc luciferase activity in the lysates
was measured using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and a Modulus II
Microplate Multimode reader (Turner BioSystem) or a Glowmax Navigator luminometer
(Promega), as described previously(24). To record GFP+ cells, 12-well plates were photographed
using an EVOS M7000 automated microscope. For flow cytometry, cells were trypsinized, fixed
and enumerated using an Attune NxT flow cytometer. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations
for plasma (NT50), and monoclonal antibodies (IC50) was calculated using 4-parameter nonlinear
regression curve fit to raw or normalized infectivity data (GraphPad Prism). Top values were
unconstrained, the bottom values were set to zero.
Human plasma samples and monoclonal antibodies
The human plasma samples COV-47, COV-72 and COV-107 and monoclonal antibodies
C144, C135 and C121 used in this study were previously reported (3). The human plasma
sample COV-NY was obtained from the New York Blood Center(21). All plasma samples were
obtained under protocols approved by Institutional Review Boards at both institutions.
