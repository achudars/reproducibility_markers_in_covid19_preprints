Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the
global COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of therapeutics hinders pandemic control1-2. Although
lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients1-3, how SARS-CoV-2 induces
tissue pathology in the lung remains elusive. Here we describe a high-throughput platform to
generate tens of thousands of self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically matched human
lung buds derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) cultured on micropatterned
substrates. Strikingly, in vitro-derived human lung buds resemble fetal human lung tissue and
display in vivo-like proximo-distal coordination of alveolar and airway tissue differentiation whose
3D epithelial self-organization is directed by the levels of KGF. Single-cell transcriptomics
unveiled the cellular identities of airway and alveolar tissue and the differentiation of WNThi
cycling alveolar stem cells, a human-specific lung cell type4. These synthetic human lung buds are
susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell
type-dependent susceptibilities to infection, intercellular transmission and cytopathology in airway
and alveolar tissue in individual lung buds. Interestingly, we detected an increased susceptibility
to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as targets of SARS-CoV-2.
We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies isolated from convalescent plasma that
efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and intercellular transmission. Our platform offers
unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant lung tissue that recapitulate key hallmarks
of human lung development and can be used to track SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify
candidate therapeutics for COVID-19.
Main text
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 sparked an explosive global pandemic of COVID19 disease, with > 75 million confirmed cases and > 1.6 million deaths to date1-2. The rational
design of COVID-19 therapies will require an understanding of the lifecycle of the virus during
infection in human cells. Key infection routes of SARS-CoV-2 involve the nasal passages, lung
airways and alveoli1-3. In particular, the lung is the one of the most vulnerable target organs for
SARS-CoV-2 as acute lung injury and pneumonia-associated complications are primary clinical
outcomes in severe cases of COVID-191-3. In this organ, airway multi-ciliated cells and alveolar
type 2 (AT2) pneumocytes are the primary targets of this virus as they express the receptor ACE2
as well as a myriad of factors that regulate viral entry into host cells3,5-9. How SARS-CoV-2
induces local tissue damage and pathology in the lungs remains elusive.

Current models of SARS-CoV-2 lung infection rely on the in vitro culture of human primary lung
tissue3,10-12, which remains challenging due to its unpredictable quality as well as its high interdonor phenotypic and genetic variability. These features are of particular importance as genetic
heterogeneity plays a large role in SARS-CoV-2 replication and outcome13. To circumvent these
challenges, directed differentiation protocols have been developed to differentiate human
pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into lung airway and alveolar cells as an alternate source of tissue
to study lung biology and disease (Jacob et al. 2017; McCauley et al. 2017; Dye et al. 2015; Miller
et al. 2019). These models recapitulate human development by deploying a set of signals known
to coordinate lung development in vivo14-17. More recently, hPSCs-derived lung cells were used to
study cellular responses upon SARS-CoV-2 infection18-19. Similarly, an organoid-based platform
for generating lung cells from hPSCs was recently used to identify small molecules that halt SARSCoV-2 infection18. This highlights the potential of using hPSC-based platforms for the study of
SARS-CoV-2-associated lung pathology and for high-throughput identification of therapeutics for
COVID-19. Although these stem cell-based models offer an inexhaustible supply of human lung
cells, they lack the controlled tissue organization observed in developing and adult lung tissue such
as the coordinated segregation of alveolar and airway tissues20-21. In addition, current protocols
take 1-3 months to differentiate lung cells from hPSCs underscoring a need to develop fast and
scalable platforms to generate these cells in vitro.
Reconstituting human lung development on confined geometries
To overcome these limitations, we sought to develop a micropattern-based platform to generate
synthetic embryonic tissues that model fetal human lungs. This technology allows us to generate
synthetic tissues that model the in vivo embryonic counterparts by exploiting the self-organizing
capabilities of hPSCs when they are cultured on confined geometries in micropattern chips22-23.
The generation of self-organized lung tissues relies on the stepwise modulation of signaling
pathways that direct lung development in vivo (Fig. 1A)14-17. As lung progenitor cells are derived
from anterior endodermal progenitors in the embryo, we first induce hPSCs to differentiate into
SOX17+ definitive endoderm in standard monolayer cultures, by applying WNT and ACTIVIN
stimulation for three days (Fig. 1B, Extended Data Fig. 1A-B). Endodermal cells were then seeded
on micropattern substrates and exposed to the TGFβ inhibitor SB431542 (SB) and BMP inhibitor
Dorsomorphin (DM) for another 3 days to induce FOXA2+ anterior endoderm (foregut; Fig. 1C,
Extended Data Fig. 1A-B)15-16. Finally, cells were exposed to WNT-activation, KGF, BMP4, and
retinoic acid (RA) stimulation for 7 days, to promote the differentiation of NKX2.1+ multipotent
lung progenitors (Fig. 1D). These progenitors give rise to both airway and alveolar cell types20-21.
We find that compared to standard monolayer differentiation protocols where KGF is
dispensable15-16, a combined induction by KGF and BMP4 together, rather than each alone led to
a significant increase in the proportion of NKX2.1+ cells on lung progenitor micropatterned
colonies (Fig. 1E, Extended Data Fig. 1C-E). Lung progenitor fate depended on the levels of KGF
and BMP4, as we detected a dose-dependent increase in the proportion of NKX2.1+ progenitors
in micropatterned cultures (Fig. 1I-J, Extended Data Fig. 2A-C). This platform allows us to
generate thousands of lung progenitor colonies of defined sizes in a single micropattern chip
(Extended Data Fig. 1F).
During early human development in vivo, fetal lung progenitors arise in epithelial buds that form
from an outpouching of the anterior endoderm, co-expressing NKX2.1 and SOX2, around week 4

of gestation20-21. Later, NKX2.1 expression becomes confined to the alveoli, while SOX2
expression specifically demarcates the airway20-21. Interestingly, we find that upon induction,
multipotent lung progenitors self-organize into three-dimensional (3D) epithelial chords
containing NKX2.1+/SOX2+ progenitors (Fig. 1F-G), reminiscent of fetal lung buds in vivo20-21.
We observed lung progenitor epithelial buds on circular colonies of 225 to 800 µm of diameter
with the number of individual buds forming restricted to only one in 225 µm colonies (Fig. 1F-G,
Extended Data Fig. 1F). We find that the levels of KGF direct the epithelialization and selforganization of lung progenitors as there is a dose-dependent increase in the epithelial area of lung
buds upon KGF modulation (Fig. 1I-K, Extended Data Fig. 2A). High doses of KGF (50 ng/mL),
robustly induce epithelial lung buds that are nearly identical in size and morphology (Fig 1I-K,
Extended Data Fig. 2A). Our model highlights the self-organizing capabilities of stem cell-derived
lung progenitors on confined circular geometries which can be used to quantitatively dissect
morphogenetic events in the embryonic human lungs.
Proximo-distal patterning of fetal-like human lung buds
Upon induction of the lung primordium, epithelial buds are further patterned along their proximodistal axis which leads to a coordinated segregation of proximal SOX2+ airway and distal
NKX2.1+/SOX9+ alveolar progenitors20-21. This initial patterning event is critical for the
coordination of region-specific tissue morphogenesis and the differentiation of airway and alveolar
cells that will ensue20-21. These features that are not faithfully recapitulated in current lung organoid
protocols14-18. Strikingly, lung progenitors grown on small confined geometries (225 µm diameter)
display proximo-distal coordination of progenitor differentiation with a SOX9+ alveolar-like and
a SOX2+ airway-like located in non-overlapping tissue domains (Fig. 2A-B), as in embryonic fetal
lung buds20-21. SOX9+ alveolar-like progenitor cells are positioned proximal to the micropattern
surface whereas SOX2+ airway-like progenitor cells are located more distally forming a
continuous 3D epithelial structure (Fig. 2A-B). These synthetic human lung buds also display
early hallmarks of cellular differentiation and contain airway multi-ciliated cells (AcTub+; Fig.
2C) as well as alveolar type 1 (HOPX+, Fig. 2D) and type 2 pneumocytes (proSFTPC+, Fig. 2C).
In 500 µm lung progenitor colonies, we also detected airway basal stem cells (P63+) and mucusproducing goblet cells (MUC5AC+) in epithelial cords that were less organized compared to 225
µm micropatterns (Extended Data Fig. 3A-E). Thus, lung progenitor cells cultured on confined
geometries self-organize into fetal-like human lung buds with proximal-distal coordination of
tissue differentiation.
Molecular signature of standardized human synthetic lungs
Single cell RNA-sequencing analysis of self-organizing human lung buds grown on circular
micropatterns (225 µm diameter), identified 5 major cell subpopulations including SOX2+ airway
progenitors (AirwayP), early differentiating alveolar cells (AT1/2), stem cell-like alveolar cells
(AT1/2s), type 1 pneumocytes (AT1) as well as mesenchymal (Mes) cells (Fig. 2E-F, Extended
Data Fig. 4A-E). SOX2+ airway cycling progenitors can be identified based on the high expression
of SOX2 and FOXJ1 as well as TOP2A, a cell cycle marker (Fig. 2F, Extended Data Fig. 4D-E).
Early AT1/2 cells can be identified based on the co-expression of the AT1 marker AGER as well
as surfactant proteins SFTPD, SFTPC and SFTPB (Fig. 2F, Extended Data Fig. 4E). AT1 cells
display high levels of SOX9 and NKX2-1 as well as the canonical AT1 markers CAV1 and HOPX
(Fig. 2F, Extended Data Fig. 4D-E). Stem cell-like AT1/2s display high levels of the canonical
AT2 marker ETV5 as well as CTNNB1, CP, WNT5A, TCF7L2 (Fig. 2F, Extended Data Fig. 5A),

which are marker genes of a human-specific stem cell-like alveolar cell type recently identified in
adult lung tissue4. Compared to other alveolar cell subpopulations, AT1/2s display high expression
of the cell cycle marker TOP2A, suggesting that these cells correspond to cycling alveolar stem
cells (Extended Data Fig. 5A). Interestingly, we also identified a population of stromal-like cells
based on the expression of lumican (LUM), collagen (COL3A1, COL1A2), and ACTA2, a marker
of lung mesenchyme (Fig. 2F, Extended Data Fig. 4D-E)24-25.
To ascertain lineage dynamics in synthetic lung buds, we performed RNA velocity analysis that
predict lineage trajectories based on transcriptional dynamics and splicing kinetics among cells2627
. We identified three independent lineages including mesenchymal, airway, and alveolar
differentiation trajectories (Fig. 2G). Among alveolar cells, our analysis suggests that early AT1/2
give rise to both AT1 and stem cell-like AT1/2s (Fig. 2G). We further resolved gene expression
correlates of alveolar lineage bifurcation (Extended Data Fig. 5B-D) and detected hallmarks of
alveolar cellular differentiation including an increase in CAV1 expression, a marker of AT1, along
the AT1 differentiation trajectory, and CTNNB1 (β-catenin) along the AT1/2s differentiation
trajectory (Fig. 2H-K). These results are consistent with recent findings that suggest that high
WNT signaling is a key hallmark of stem cell-like alveolar cells4. Our analysis provides new
insights on early differentiation events in fetal lung buds and resolves unprecedented
developmental relationships among alveolar cells.
Tracking SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in synthetic human lung buds
As our synthetic human lung buds contain the proposed cellular targets of SARS-CoV-23 and
endemic coronaviruses, we sought to determine whether we can track SARS-CoV-2 infection and
pathology in these tissues. We observed viral tropism for endemic coronaviruses HCoV-229E,
HCoV-OC43 and, to a lower extent, HCoV-NL63 (Extended Data Fig. 6), suggesting that human
lung buds are a tractable model to study respiratory infection by human coronaviruses. To
determine if our platform recapitulates COVID-19 pathology, we infected synthetic lung buds at
different stages of lung bud formation with a patient-derived isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (USAWA1/2020; Fig. 3A-C, Extended Data Fig. 7A-C). We detected viral tropism in both SOX2+
airway and SOX9+ alveolar cells (Fig. 3A-C, Extended Data Fig. 7A-C), including in multiciliated cells and type 2 pneumocytes (Figure 3G-H), primary targets of SARS-CoV-23. In contrast
to experiments with primary lung tissue cultured in vitro3, we identified an increased susceptibility
to infection in alveolar cells compared to airway cells (Fig. 3C) and identified type 1 pneumocytes
(HOPX+) as additional targets of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3I). Consistent with these results, we
detected higher expression of the receptor ACE2 as well as proteases TMPRSS2 and FURIN,
which regulate SARS-CoV-2 entry into target cell types1,28-29, in alveolar cell types compared to
airway cells (Extended Data Fig. 5E-F).
Interestingly, we identified tropism in phospho-Histone3 (pH3)-positive cycling SOX9+ alveolar
cells, which correspond to AT1/2s, consistent with the high expression of ACE2 and related
proteases observed in this cell type (Fig. 3D-F, Extended Data Fig. 5E-F). We did not observe
significant differences in the levels of infection between dividing and non-dividing SOX9+
alveolar cells (Fig. 3F). Our analysis suggests that cycling alveolar stem cells may also represent
targets of SARS-CoV-2 in alveoli, with important clinical implications for COVID19.

Following a viral transmission paradigm in which we tracked infection 48- and 96-hours postinfection (Fig. 3J), we observed an increase in the number of infected cells over time in a cell typeindependent manner (Fig. 3K-M). This suggests that intercellular transmission (viral spread) was
occurring in synthetic human lung buds. We also observed high levels of apoptosis upon infection
in both alveolar and airway tissues compared to mock-infected synthetic lung buds mimicking
virus-induced lung pathogenesis (Fig. 3L-P). Using this model, we can recapitulate the entire viral
lifecycle and are now able to track cell type-dependent susceptibilities to infection, intercellular
transmission, and cytopathic effects in hundreds of individual synthetic lung buds grown in a single
micropattern chip.
Synthetic human lungs for comparative therapeutics screens
As our platform mimics in vivo features of lung tissue and is scalable, we next screened
therapeutics that were shown to limit SARS-CoV-2 infection through binding assays and in cell
lines30. We tested human antibodies isolated from convalescent plasma of patients30 and evaluated
the efficiency of the antibodies in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 and preventing infection (Fig. 4A).
Each neutralizing antibody, nAb, compared to a control (Fig. 4B), was tested at a range of dilutions
(Fig. 4C-E). We found that each potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 4C-E) at IC50s
similar to those found for cell lines30. The nAbs also seemed to broadly inhibit SARS-CoV-2
infection, rather than in a cell-type specific manner (Fig. 4F-G). As the initial assay shows that
these nAbs can inhibit infection when incubated with the virus prior to infection, we next wanted
to test how pragmatic therapeutic approaches where the nAb is administered once the patient has
already seroconverted would affect replication (Fig. 4H). We find that nAbs can inhibit SARSCoV-2 spread throughout the organoid, when compared to a nAb control targeting West Nile virus,
highlighting the utility of our system to mimic in vivo situations (Fig 4I). Therefore, these
antibodies may represent biologics to block SARS-CoV-2 infection and intercellular transmission
to treat COVID-19 disease31-32. Moreover, our work highlights the utility of synthetic human lung
buds to test candidate COVID-19 therapeutics in a high-throughput manner.
Conclusion
Our work highlights the self-organizing capabilities of lung progenitors when they are cultured on
confined geometries. Our synthetic human lung bud model recapitulates the earliest events in fetal
lung development which involves the proximo-distal coordination of alveolar and airway cellular
differentiation and region-specific tissue morphogenetic events20-21. It also offers key advantages
to current in vitro models as it displays in vivo-like tissue organization and complexity as well as
it provides inexhaustible access to disease-relevant lung tissue. Our work delineates novel cell
types and cellular ontogeny in fetal human lung buds at the tissue and single cell level. This will
allow for the interrogation of the molecular and genetic mechanisms orchestrating early human
lung differentiation and morphogenesis, in both normal and disease states in which these processes
may go awry such as lung cancer and other diseases. Our work also provides fast and scalable
access to lung tissue for regenerative medicine and modeling lung diseases.
This study also highlights the potential of using synthetic lungs to identify novel therapeutics that
block infection by SARS-CoV-2, endemic coronaviruses as well as other respiratory viruses.
Compared to 3D organoid models where tracking virus-induced cellular responses is challenging
due to inter-organoid variability in cell type complexity and composition18, our platform allows

for the individual tracking of many genetically-matched reproducible organoids at a time to gain
a quantitative understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung pathology. We have established a
highly quantitative platform to assess differential cell type-dependent susceptibilities to infection
and cytopathology as well as to identify key target cell types that are otherwise inaccessible for
experimentation in vivo. Whether our lung model recapitulates infection in fetal and adult tissue
in vivo warrants further investigation. As we have detected tropism of other endemic coronaviruses
(Extended Data Fig. 6), our platform will help gain an understanding of the cellular mechanisms
that lead to the increased pathogenic effects and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to other
related viruses. Importantly, as our approach is also amenable for high-throughput genetic
analysis, it will unveil the complement of host factors that control lung infection which may
represent therapeutic targets for COVID-19 and other emerging diseases as well. We expect our
synthetic human lung model to be transformative for the elucidation of the molecular basis of
respiratory infections and lung diseases for which there are currently no treatments.
Methods
Maintenance of hPSCs
RUES2 (NIHhESC-09-0013), RUES2-GLR33 and HUES8 iCas9 (NIHhESC-09-0021) hPSC lines
were used in this study and maintained in HUESM (DMEM supplemented with 20% knockout
serum replacement, 1×B27 supplement without vitamin A, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids,
2 mM GlutaMax and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) conditioned by mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEF-CM) and supplemented with 20 ng*ml−1 basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The cells
were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 on tissue culture dishes that were coated with Geltrex (Life
Technologies) solution.
Generation of lung buds in micropatterns
hPSCs were first differentiated into definitive endoderm using the STEMDiff Definitive Endoderm
Kit (Stem Cell Technologies), with 1 day addition of supplement CJ and MR and 2 days addition
of supplement CJ only. Upon endoderm induction, cells were washed once with PBS-/- (Gibco)
and dissociated with Accutase (Stem Cell Technologies) for 7 mins. Cells were then dissociated
with a pipette to ensure a single cell suspension and diluted in 4 times complete serum-free
differentiation medium (cSFDM) containing DMEM/F12 (Gibco) with B27 Supplement with
retinoic acid (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA), N2 Supplement (Invitrogen), 0.1% bovine serum
albumin Fraction V (Invitrogen), ß-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), Glutamax (ThermoFisher), 50
µg*mL-1 ascorbic acid (Sigma), and normocin with supplements of 10 µm SB431542 (‘‘SB’’;
Tocris), 2 µm Dorsomorphin (‘‘DS’’; Stemgent) and 10 µm ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632; Abcam).
Cells were further diluted with the same medium and 5 × 105 cells in 3.0 ml of medium were
placed over a laminin-coated micropattern glass coverslips (CYTOOCHIPS Arena A, Arena 500A,
Arena EMB A, Arena 225A)22 in a 35-mm tissue culture dish, left untouched for 10 mins and then
incubated at 37 ° C. After 3 hours, the micropattern was washed once with PBS+/+, which was then
replaced with cSFDM with 10 µm SB and 2 µm DM. 2 days later, the media was replaced with
cSFDM with 10 µm SB and 2 µm DM. The next day, micropattern cultures were fed in lung
induction medium (LIM) which contains cSFDM supplemented with 50 ng*mL-1 KGF (or
indicated in each experiment; R&D systems), 10 ng*mL-1 BMP4 (R&D systems), 100 nM retinoic

acid (“RA”; Sigma Aldrich) and 3 µM CHIR9902 (EMD Millipore). Micropattern cultures were
fed every other day in LIM for 7 days or until tissues were collected for analysis.
To generate synthetic lung buds on 96 well plates, 4x104 definitive endoderm cells were seeded on
laminin-coated 96 well plates (CYTOOPlates, 200A), left untouched for 1 hour and then incubated
at 37 ° C for 3 hours in cSFDM with 10 µm SB, 2 µm DM and 10 µm ROCK inhibitor. After this
point, the protocol described above to generate lung buds on coverslips was followed.
Immunostaining
Micropattern coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformal-dehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences
15713) in warm medium for 30 min, rinsed three times with PBS–/–, and then blocked and
permeabilized with 3% normal donkey serum (Jackson Immunoresearch 017-000-121) with 0.5%
Triton X-100 (Sigma 93443) in PBS–/– for 30 min. Micropatterns were incubated with primary
antibodies for 1.5 h, washed three times in PBS–/– for 5 min each, incubated with secondary
antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488, Alexa 555, Alexa 594 or Alexa 647 (1:1,000 dilution,
Molecular Probes), fluorescently-conjugated phalloidin (1:400; Life Technologies) and 10
ng*ml−1 of DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific D1306) for 30 min and then washed three times with
PBS–/-. Coverslips were mounted on slides using ProLong Gold antifade mounting medium
(Molecular Probes P36934).
The primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-SOX9 (Millipore; AB5535; 1:250), goat
anti-SOX2 (R&D Systems; AF2018; 1:250), rabbit anti-NKX2.1 (Abcam; ab76013; 1:200),
mouse anti-Acetylated Tubulin (Sigma; T7451; 1:1000), goat anti-TP63 (R&D Systems;
BAF1916; 1:250), rabbit anti-proSPC (Seven Hills; WRAB-9337; 1:500), mouse anti-HOPX
(Santa Cruz; sc-398703; 1:250), rabbit anti-nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 (GeneTex; GTX135357;
1;1000); rabbit anti-Active Caspase-3 (R&D Systems; AF835; 1:250); mouse anti-Mucin 5AC
(Abcam; ab3649; 1:250); human anti-Spike SARS-CoV-2 (Robbiani et al., 2020; 1:1,000); antiHNF-3BETA/FOXA2 (Neuromics; GT15186; 1:200); mouse J2 dsRNA (SCICONS; 1;1,000),
phospho Histone H3 (Cell Signaling; 9706S; 1:200) and goat anti-SOX17 (R&D Systems;
AF1924; 1:200). To detect infected cells for HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63, a
mouse monoclonal anti-dsRNA antibody (Scicons: catalog no. 10010500) was used under similar
conditions.
Imaging
All confocal images were acquired on a Zeiss Inverted LSM 780 laser scanning confocal
microscope with a 10X, 20X or 25X oil-immersion objective. 96 well plates were imaged on a
ImageXpress Micro with a 10X objective. Three-dimensional visualization and image processing
was performed in ImageJ.
Imaging analysis
Analysis of confocal Z-stacks was performed using CellProfiler v4.0.4 (https://cellprofiler.org/).

percentage of cells positive for a given marker was calculated as the sum of the number of cells
identified as positive for the marker in each Z section divided by the total number of cells
identified.
96-well plates image analysis was performed using ImageJ. Briefly, nuclei were identified and set
to a mask. The ROIs were then expanded, creating a new mask to interrogate cytoplasmic signals
of virus infection in the SARS-CoV-2 images.
Single cell RNA-sequencing analysis
Micropatterned coverslips with 225-μm diameter synthetic lung buds at day 7 of lung induction
were dissociated with TrypLE Express (Gibco) for 10 min at 37 °C. After dissociation, the cells
were washed three times in PBS–/– (Gibco) with 0.04% BSA and strained through a Flowmi tip 40
μm strainer. Cell count and viability were determined on a Countess II Automated Cell Counter.
Samples were loaded for capture with the Chromium System using the Single Cell 3′ v3 reagents
(10X Genomics). Following cell capture and lysis, cDNA was synthesized and amplified
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (10X Genomics). The resulting libraries were
sequenced on the Nova-seq platform. The Cell Ranger (v.2.0.2) software pipeline was used to
create FASTQ files which were aligned to the hg19 genome using default parameters. These data
are available through the NCBI GEO accession number GSE163698.
Filtered gene expression matrices were generated using Cell Ranger and subsequently used for
downstream analyses using Scanpy (v.1.6.0) (https://pypi.org/project/scanpy/). Data was filtered
to have a minimum of 2000 and a maximum of 8000 detected genes per cell and genes were
filtered to be expressed in at least 3 cells. Cells with over 10% mitochondrial genes were discarded.
Clustering of cells was performed using the Leiden algorithm (resolution=0.4) and visualized using
UMAP plots (n.neighbors = 50, PCA components= 50). Differential gene expression analysis was
performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney-U) test to identify cluster markers.
RNA velocity
Count matrix layered with spliced and unspliced annotations were obtained using Kallisto
Bustools34. In brief, kb-python==0.24.4 was used to capture spliced and unspliced transcripts using
-lamanno function with the GRCm38 human genome. The Kallisto unfiltered count matrix was
imported in Scanpy and further processed for scVelo (v0.2.2) analysis26-27. UMAP coordinates
and clusters annotation from the Scanpy clustering were used.
SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission analysis
SARS-CoV-2 (strain: USA-WA1/2020) and HCoV-NL63 were obtained from BEI Resources
(NR-52281 and NR-470). HCoV-OC43 was obtained from ZeptoMetrix (cat. #0810024CF) and
HCoV-229E was generously provided by Volker Thiel (University of Bern). All viruses were
amplified at 33 °C in Huh-7.5 cells to generate a P1 stock. To generate working stocks, Huh-7.5
cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 plaque forming unit (PFU)/cell
(SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43) and 0.1 PFU/cell (HCoV-229E) and incubated at 33

°C until virus-induced CPE was observed. Supernatants were subsequently harvested, clarified
by centrifugation (3,000 g × 10 min) at 4 dpi (HCoV-229E), 6 dpi (SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43)
and 10 dpi (HCoV-NL63), and aliquots stored at −80 °C.
Viral titers were measured on Huh-7.5 cells by standard plaque assay. Briefly, 500 µL of serial 10fold virus dilutions in Opti-MEM were used to infect 4 × 105 cells seeded the day prior into wells
of a 6-well plate. After 90 min adsorption, the virus inoculum was removed, and cells were overlaid
with DMEM containing 10% FBS with 1.2% microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel). Cells were
incubated for 4 days (HCoV-229E), 5 days (SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43) and 6 days (HCoVNL63) at 33 °C, followed by fixation with 7% formaldehyde and crystal violet staining for plaque
enumeration. All SARS-CoV-2 experiments were performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory.
Antibody treatments
Neutralization assays were performed as previously described30. Briefly, antibodies were serially
diluted in LIM, mixed with a constant amount of SARS-CoV-2 (2 x 105 PFU for the larger chips,
and 5 x 104 PFU in the 96-well plate assays) and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The antibody–
virus mix was then added to the 96-well plates or microchip containing synthetic human lungs.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired two-sided t tests, unless stated otherwise. For all
the experiments included in this study, three or more biological replicates were performed using
stage-matched controls as a reference. No statistical analysis was used to predetermine sample size
and no data were excluded.

minimum (0) infection levels. F-G) Representative images of synthetic lungs infected with SARSCoV-2 and treated with varying doses of C121 human antibody (scale bar: 50µm). H)
Experimental scheme to test the effect on neutralizing antibodies on intercellular transmission.
Synthetic lung buds were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at day 5 of lung bud formation and treated
with neutralizing antibodies 48 hours later. I) Proportion of infected cells in synthetic human lungs
treated with C121 or a West Nile virus (WNV)-specific antibody from day 7 to day 9.
