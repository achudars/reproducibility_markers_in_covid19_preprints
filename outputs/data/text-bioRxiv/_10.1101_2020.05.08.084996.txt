Abstract
The site of SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication critically impacts strategies for COVID-19 diagnosis,
transmission mitigation, and treatment. We determined the cellular location of the SARS-CoV-2
target receptor protein, ACE2, in the human upper airway, finding striking enrichment (200-700
folds) in the olfactory neuroepithelium relative to nasal respiratory or tracheal epithelial cells.
This cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 may underlie its high transmissibility and association with
olfactory

dysfunction,

while

suggesting

a

viral

reservoir

potentially

amenable

to

intranasal

therapy.

Introduction
The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a major threat to global health
[1].

The

mechanism

of

cellular

entry

by

SARS-CoV-2

is

through

binding

to

angiotensin-

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [2, 3], a metalloproteinase ectoenzyme that primarily functions in
the regulation of angiotensin II, but also has non-catalytic roles such as intestinal neutral amino
acid transport. The level of ACE2 protein and its subcellular localization in the respiratory tract
may be a key determinant of susceptibility to infection, symptoms, and outcomes in COVID-19.
In humans, ACE2 protein is broadly expressed in the lung, kidney, and small intestine [4].
Pathological analysis of COVID-19 postmortem samples shows substantial damage in the lung
[5],

suggesting

that

the

airway

is

the

principal

entry

and

target

of

SARS-CoV-2.

However,

analysis of multiple single cell RNA-seq datasets reveal overall low ACE2 RNA transcription in
nasal airway epithelium, with further reduced expression in lower airway club cells and rare
expression

in alveolar

epithelial

type II cells

[6]. This pattern of ACE2 expression

provides

evidence that the upper, rather than the lower, airway is the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

There is growing interest in a presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection characterized by olfactory
loss without concomitant nasal inflammatory symptoms. Disturbances in the sense of smell
have been widely reported in COVID-19 patients internationally, with a reported prevalence as
high as 85% in a large, multicenter European survey [7]. These reports show, importantly, that
some

COVID-19

patients

manifest

olfactory

loss

as

their

initial

or

only

symptom.

As

this

presentation is largely not recognized or thought to mandate isolation, this patient group may
be

a

source

of

continued

viral

spread

and

a

target

population

for

early

intervention

and

mitigation. The loss of the sense of smell suggests the possibility of direct targeting by SARSCoV-2 of the olfactory system. However, the cellular location of ACE2 protein in the olfactory
epithelium has not been previously demonstrated.

that the majority of ACE2 staining is localized to the apical surface of Krt18 sustentacular cells
in the olfactory neuroepithelium (Figure 1A and B). This distribution of ACE2 protein is similar to
that reported in bat nasal epithelium [8]. We further quantified olfactory ACE2 expression and
found the

ACE2 positive cells to

(Figure 1E and F) and PGP9.5 (Figure 1G), respectively.

High intensity ACE2 staining was detected in all 11 olfactory mucosal biopsies. In addition,
ACE2 is frequently observed in Bowman’s glands (Figure 2A). In the adjacent nasal respiratory
epithelium, ACE2 is also located on the apical surface (Figure 2B and C), with a significantly
lower level of expression than the olfactory epithelium (Figure 2D). As shown in Figure 2E in the

+
adjacent area, intensive ACE2 expressed in PGP9.5 olfactory region but can barely be detected
in PGP9.5 respiratory epithelium. Only 47.4% of nasal respiratory epithelial biopsies (9 in 19)
contained ACE2 positive epithelial cells. The intensity of ACE2 fluorescence was 200-700-fold
higher in the olfactory epithelium (Figure 2F).

We further examined ACE2 protein in tracheal epithelium. In 2 of 7 specimens, we detected

+
low expression of ACE2 in Muc5ac
secretory cells (Figure 2G). The expression of ACE2 by
secretory cells is reminiscent of the recent findings that increased ACE2 expression in small
airway epithelium in COPD patients [10], a disease characterized by secretory cell hyperplasia
[11]. Together, the comparatively enhanced human airway expression of ACE2 localized to the
olfactory neuroepithelium (Figure 2D and E) suggests a mechanism of olfactory loss and a
potential entry point of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system and causes neurological
symptoms in COVID-19 patients [12].

Discussion
Understanding of the pattern of

viral load in tissues of COVID-19 patients is critical for

diagnosis, management of transmission, and potential treatment strategies. Detection of SARSCoV-2 in clinical specimens shows that the highest viral copy number is found in nasal swabs

(~200 fold), compared to bronchoalveolar lavage or pharyngeal swabs [13, 14]. In the early
stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral RNA can readily detected in upper respiratory specimens
but not in blood, urine, or stool [15]. These findings, taken together with ACE2 protein cellular
localization presented here, suggests that active virus infection and replication occurs in the
apical layer of nasal and olfactory mucosa. The differential expression of ACE2 in the olfactory
neuroepithelium and respiratory epithelium may help account for the spectrum of nasal-related
symptoms, while also raising the intriguing possibility that COVID-19 may be amenable to novel
therapeutic approaches. Whether nasal saline irrigation, a common treatment for sinonasal

ONLINE METHODS

Human Olfactory and Nasal Tissue

The research protocol involving human specimens was approved by the Johns Hopkins
institutional review board, and all subjects provided signed informed consent. Human olfactory
epithelial or nasal airway epithelial samples were collected from CRS patients and from control
subjects undergoing endonasal surgical approaches for non-CRS disease processes. The
specimen was immediately fixed in 4% PFA for 5h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. After being
washed in PBS, tissues were equilibrated sequentially in 15% and 30% sucrose, the tissue was
then embedded in Optimum Cutting Temperature (OCT, Tissue-Tek) for sectioning.
Immunohistochemistry

After antigen retrieval step, sections were washed in PBS and then blocked in 10% normal
serum containing 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C
overnight. After washing in PBS, the tissue sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor conjugated
secondary antibodies along with DAPI for nuclear counterstaining. The following primary
antibodies were used: Goat anti-ACE2 (1:40, AF933; R&D) Mouse anti-Keratin 18 (1:500, Pierce
MA1-39483), Rabbit anti-DCX (1:500, GeneTex, GTX134052), Mouse anti-Mucin 5AC (1:200, Abcam
ab3649).
Confocal Imaging and Quantification

Immunostaining images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope. For
quantification, at least 3 images were collected from each specimen using 40x objectives under
the z stack scan mode at same depth. Positive cells in olfactory or respiratory mucosa were
quantified per mm of surface epithelium. Quantification of the ACE2 fluorescence intensity was
preformed using Image J software.
Statistical analyses

Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. as indicated. Data analyses were carried out using
GraphPad Prism. For experiments with two groups, P values were calculated using the unpaired
two-tailed Student’s t-test. Differences were considered significant when P < 0.05.
