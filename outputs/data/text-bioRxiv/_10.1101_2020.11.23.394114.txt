1 Introduction
The initial global outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

56

(SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),

57

was initially identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. As of July 2020, there were more

58

than 13.3 million confirmed cases worldwide, with total deaths exceeding 573,000 (Dong et al.,

59

2020). Worldwide concerted efforts have been made in an attempt to characterize the disease and

60

identify effective therapies targeting SARS-CoV-2 including lines of studies focusing on the

61

route of infection, the potential routes of administration of therapeutic agents as well as the

62

potential efficacy of antiseptics (Meister et al., 2020). In this vein, a landmark study found that

63

the coronavirus infects the nasal cavity via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein

64

which appears to be the host-cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Since the

65

nasal epithelium cells have the highest percentage of ACE2 expressing ciliate cells in the

66

proximal airways, it is plausible to suggest that pharmacological agents such as sprays that are

67

used via the intranasal route of administration might be optimal candidates for providing

68

effective therapies against COVID-19 (Jia et al., 2005).

69

In a recent literature review conducted by Higgins et al. it is highlighted that intranasal

70

drug delivery represents an important area of research for viral diseases and COVID-19 (Higgins

71

et al., 2020). They concluded that the intranasal method of drug delivery has potential relevance

72

for future clinical trials in the setting of disease prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in

73

addition to other viral diseases (Higgins et al., 2020). Subsequently, Siddiqi et.al (2020), in a

74

diagram of COVID-19 disease progression, illustrated that the viral response phase is highest

75

during the early infection of the disease process, of which patients manifest mild constitutional

76

symptoms. Taken together the aforementioned studies support our rationale that therapeutic

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.23.394114; this version posted November 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

77

strategies should be aimed at reducing the viral load in the nose by targeting this mild-moderate

78

phase of the disease process, and hence the use of a nasal spray might be an effective means to

79

accomplish this therapeutic strategy.

80

In the present study, we have identified two candidate agents with potential activity

81

against SARS-CoV-2 which can be administered intranasally, namely, xylitol and grape seed

82

fruit extract (GSE). Xylitol, a sweetener with antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties,

83

has been shown effective in decreasing the incidence of dental caries and improving chronic

84

rhinitis as well as important microbiota and immunological modulatory effects (Akgül et al.,

85

2020; Haukioja et al., 2008; Weissman et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2016). Xylitol has been reported to

86

have multiple health benefits as well as is generally safe and well-tolerated for most adults in

87

doses up to 35 grams per day and up to 20 grams per day in children (Salli et al., 2019; Storey et

88

al., 2007; Ur-Rehman et al., 2015). A derivative of grapefruit seeds, GSE, is associated with

89

abundant health benefits due to the presence of antioxidants and proanthocyanidin complexes

90

(Chacón et al., 2009). Also, GSE has been documented to have inhibitory effects against the

91

avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, infections bursal disease virus, as well as other

92

pathogenic enteric viruses (Komura et al., 2019; Su and D'Souza, 2011). A commercially

93

available nasal spray combining xylitol and GSE, marketed as Xlear (American Fork, UT, USA),

94

has been widely used in the United States for several decades, but the antiviral effects of this

95

solution have not been documented. Accordingly, the aim of the present in vitro study was to

96

examine the virucidal effect of Xlear against SARS-CoV-2. To this end, two independent sets of

97

experiments were carried out to test the hypothesis that Xlear is an effective (Experiment I) and

98

replicable (Experiment II) means to deactivate SARS-CoV-2 the causative microorganism of

99

COVID-19.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

102

2.1 Experiment I: Xlear Virucidal Activity Efficacy

103

2.1.1 Procedure

104

SARS-CoV-2, USA-WA1/2020 strain, virus stock was prepared before testing by

105

growing 2 passages in Vero 76 cells. Culture media for prepared stock (test media) was

106

MEM with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 50 µg/mL gentamicin. Human rhinovirus 16,

107

strain 11757 purchased from ATCC (Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA), was grown in 3

108

passages of HeLa cells in MEM with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 25 mM MgCl2, and 50

109

µg/mL gentamicin. Test media is the growth media with 5% FBS.

110

2.1.2 Virucidal Assay

111

Test compounds including commercially available Xlear containing purified water,

112

11% Pure Xylitol (Shandon Lujian, Shandong, China), 0.6%NaCL (Saline), and 0.015%

113

GSE (Chemie Research & Manufacturing Co., Casselberry, FL, USA) were obtained from

114

the manufacturer in liquid form and stored at room temperature. The test compound 11%

115

xylitol in saline was diluted 1:2 with water before testing. Each solution was mixed directly

116

with virus stock so that the final concentration was 90% of each test compound and 10%

117

virus stock. A single concentration was tested in triplicate. Test media without virus was

118

added to duplicate tubes of the compounds to serve as toxicity and neutralization controls.

119

Ethanol (90%) was tested in parallel as a positive control and water only as a virus control.

120

The test solutions were incubated at room temperature (22 ± 2ºC) for 15 minutes with

121

SARS- CoV-2 or Rhinovirus-16. The solutions were then neutralized by a 1/10 dilution in

122

the test media of each specific virus. The virucidal assays were performed in triplicate, then

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.23.394114; this version posted November 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

123

after neutralization, the triplicate samples were pooled, serially diluted, and assayed for

124

infectious virus.

125

2.1.3 Virus Quantification

126

The surviving virus from each sample was quantified by standard end-point

127

dilution assay. Briefly, the neutralized samples were pooled and serially diluted using

128

eight log dilutions in test medium. Then 100 µL of each dilution was plated into

129

quadruplicate wells of 96-well plates containing 80-90% confluent Vero 76 (SARS-CoV-

130

2) or HeLa cells (Rhino-16). The toxicity controls were added to an additional 4 wells of

131

Vero 76 or HeLa cells and 2 of those wells at each dilution were infected with virus to

132

serve as neutralization controls, ensuring that the residual sample in the titer assay plate

133

did not inhibit growth and detection of the surviving virus. Plates were incubated at 37 ±

134

2ºC with 5% CO2 for 5 days and at 33 ± 2ºC with 5% CO2 for 4 days for the SARS-CoV-2

135

assay and the Rhinovirus-16 assay, respectively. Each well was then scored for the

136

presence or absence of an infectious virus. The titers were measured using a standard

137

endpoint dilution 50% cell culture infectious dose (CCID50) assay calculated using the

138

Reed-Muench (1948) equation and the log reduction value (LRV) of each compound

139

compared to the negative (water) control was calculated.

140

2.2 Experiment II: Xlear Virucidal Activity Replication

141

2.2.1 Procedure

142

SARS-CoV2/Switzerland/GE9586/2020 virus stock was amplified and titrated in

143

Vero E6 cells by plaque assay cultured in DMEM HG with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS)

144

and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

145

Dose-response Assay

146

Xlear nasal spray was serially diluted in DMEM HG and incubated with SARS-CoV2

147

(MOI 0.003 corresponding to 200 pfu/well) for 1 hour at 37°C and subsequently added on Vero

148

E6 cells for 1 hour at 37°C. The inoculum was then removed, cells were washed and overlaid

149

with DMEM HG with 5% FBS and Avicel 0.8%. 48hpi cells were fixed with PFA 4% and

150

stained with crystal violet. Plaques were counted and percent of infection calculated in

151

comparison with untreated wells. The experiments were performed twice independently, and

152

each was performed in duplicate.

153

Virucidal Assay

154

Xlear spray was mixed in different concentrations with SARS-CoV2 stock (105pfu). The

155

compound was mixed directly with the virus solution with a final concentration of respectively

156

90%, 80%, 60%, or 20%. PBS was used as control. The solution and virus were incubated at 37

157

°C for 1 hour. The solution was then neutralized by a 1/10 dilution in test media. A 60%

158

condition was repeated in two independent experiments while the other dilutions were performed

159

in a single experiment in duplicate.

160

The infectious virus from each sample was quantified by standard end-point dilution

161

assay. 100 µL of each dilution were plated into quadruplicate wells of 96-well plates containing

162

80-90% confluent Vero 76 cells. Plates were incubated at 37ºC with 5% CO2 for three days.

163

Each well was then scored for the presence or absence of the virus. The end-point titers

164

(TCID50) values were calculated using the Reed- Muench (1948) equation.

165

2.2.2 Toxicity assay

166

Vero-E6 (13000 cells per well) were seeded in 96-well plate. Xlear was serially diluted in

167

DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and added on cells for 1h, followed by a washout, addition

168

of DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS for additional 48h hours. MTT reagent (Sigma Aldrich)

169

was added on cells for 3h at 37°C according to manufacturer instructions, subsequently cells

170

were lysed with pure DMSO and absorbance read at 570 nm. Percentages of viability were

171

calculated by comparing the absorbance in treated wells and untreated.

172

3 RESULTS

173

3.1 Experiment I

174

Virus titers and LRV of Rhinovirus-16 and SARS-CoV-2 when incubated with a

175

single concentration of the Xlear solutions are shown in Table 1. After a 15-minute contact

176

time, the Xlear nasal spray was not effective at reducing the infectious Rhino-16 virus.

177

When tested against SARS-CoV-2, the test compound GSE 0.2% was the only compound

178

effective at reducing >3 log10 CCID50 infectious virus from, 3.67 log10 CCID50/0.1 mL

179

to an undetectable amount of infectious virus (Table 1). The Xlear nasal spray and the

180

GSE 0.2% had some toxicity in the top rows (1/10 dilution of the test sample) which may

181

have contributed to the virucidal effect of the GSE. The 11% xylitol and 11% erythritol

182

had no cytotoxicity. The positive control and neutralization control performed as expected.

183

3.2 Experiment II

184

SARS-Cov2 is inhibited in the dose-response assay (Figure 1) by different concentrations of

185

Xlear spray. However, the dilution 1:2 in medium evidenced damage to the cells with almost

186

complete loss of the cells, while with the dilution 1:6 a partial damage to the cell was evidenced,

187

while no morphologic changes in cells were visible from dilution 1:12 onwards. These results

188

were further confirmed with toxicity assays (Figure 1b).

189

In the virucidal assays (Figure 2), Xlear showed virucidal activity at the different

190

concentrations tested. Complete inhibition of viral infectivity was observed for the 90%, 80%,

191

60% condition, and a reduction of 2.17 log of viral titer in the 20% condition. In this assay, the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.23.394114; this version posted November 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

192

mixture of virus and Xlear was neutralized by a 1/10 dilution before addition on cells, therefore

193

diluting the compound below the toxic doses determined in the toxicity assay (Figure 1b).

4 DISCUSSION
The present study sought to evaluate the in vitro virucidal effects of a solution combining

197

xylitol and GSE in a nasal spray formulation known as Xlear. The novel results of this study

198

support our hypothesis that Xlear displays virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2. The present

199

results validated by two independent sets of experiments, performed by different labs, on

200

different viral strains, provide early evidence to encourage further pilot and clinical studies

201

aimed at investigating the use of Xlear as a potential treatment for COVID-19.

202

Xlear is a solution of xylitol and GSE, in line with previous reports, the latter displayed

203

antiviral activity. Komura et al. demonstrated the efficacy of GSE as an antimicrobial agent on

204

avian pathogens including avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, infectious bursal

205

disease virus, Salmonella Infantis, and Escherichia coli (Komura et al., 2019). Also, GSE has

206

shown similar antiviral activities against human enteric pathogens including Hepatitis A virus in

207

a dose-dependent manner (Su and D'Souza, 2011). Interestingly, GSE antiviral activity seems to

208

be particularly effective on enveloped viruses. Since SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus the

209

GSE characteristics to induced or target the viral envelope should not be overlooked as candidate

210

therapies for COVID-19 emerge (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). On the other hand, xylitol did

211

not show in vitro virucidal properties in the present study. However, it seems that the viral

212

protective effects of xylitol are evident in vivo a suggested by studies demonstrating ameliorating

213

effects against human respiratory syncytial virus and changes in the microbiota when consumed

214

orally (Uebanso et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2016).

215

The precise mechanism of action of GSE is poorly understood. However, according to

216

the present virucidal tests, the active component of the spray is the GSE, which is in line with

217

previous reports demonstrating that the extract was is effective to inactivate different enveloped

218

and non-enveloped viruses (Su and D'Souza, 2011).

219
220

Moreover, it seems that the mechanism of action of GSE targets the viral adsorption (or viral

221

binding) to a greater extent than viral replication. It is worth mentioning that studies of the

222

precise mechanism of action of GSE are beyond the scope of this work.

223

As with any research study, the present experimental design is not free from some

224

limitations. The minimum time required for the Xlear solution to exert the virucidal effect was

225

not investigated. Furthermore, to assess the relevance of the time-dependent effect of Xylitol

226

effect in vivo, it will be important to verify if the addition of the spray-on cells previously

227

infected at nontoxic doses would exert a reduction of the viral titer. Also, whether pre-treating

228

the cells with the spray and subsequently adding the virus would decrease the rate of infection

229

would be needed to assess the possible preventive use of the nasal spray.

230

CONCLUSIONS

231

This study demonstrates the strong virucidal effects against SARS-CoV-2 of the Xlear

232

nasal spray compound with xylitol and GSE. Using a virucidal nasal spray could become a

233

cutting-edge element in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease. To further ascertain

234

the impact of this nasal spray in SARS-CoV-2, we propose to perform further a randomized

235

placebo-controlled study of intranasally delivered Xlear in patients with mild to moderate SARS-

236

CoV-2 and randomized placebo-controlled preventive trial in healthcare workers.

Figure 1. a) SARS-CoV-2 dose-response inhibition. Xlear was incubated at different dilutions

309

with SARS-CoV2 (200 pfu) for 1h at 37 C. At the end of the incubation, mixtures were serially

310

diluted and added for 1h at 37°C on Vero-E6 cells. Mixtures were then removed, and cells

311

overlaid with medium containing 0.8% avicel. Cells were fixed 48hpi and plaques were counted.

312

Results are mean and SEM of 2 independent experiments performed in duplicate. b) Xlear

313

toxicity evaluation. Different dilutions of the nasal spray were incubated for 1h (followed by

314

addition of medium for 47h) or for 48h on cells in DMEM 5% FBS. At the end of the incubation

315

MTT reagent was added on cells and percentages of viability were evaluated by comparing

316

treated and untreated wells.

Figure 2. SARS CoV-2 virucidal assay. Xlear was incubated with SARS-CoV2 (5*105 pfu) for

320

1h at 37 C. At the end of the incubation, mixtures were serially diluted and added on Vero-E6

321

cells. Cells were fixed 48hpi and scored for presence or absence of cytopathic effect and

322

TCID50/ml was determined. Results are mean and SD of two independent experiments.
