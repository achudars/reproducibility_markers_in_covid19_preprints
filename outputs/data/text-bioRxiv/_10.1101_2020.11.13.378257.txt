Highlights:
•

ACIS KEPTIDE stimulates the internalization of ACE-2 receptor (Fig. 2) and buffers the
membrane localization of ACE-2 receptors (Fig. 2, 6 & 8). Intranasal inoculation of SARSCoV2 upregulates the expression of ACE-2 in lung epithelium (Fig.6) and kidney tubular
cells (Fig.8). ACIS KEPTIDE normalizes the expression of ACE-2 in the kidney tubular
cells of virus-treated K18-hACE2mice (Fig. 8).

•

ACIS KEPTIDETM completely prevents the entry of SARS-CoV2 in Bronchiolar
epithelium (Fig.6), alveolar parenchyma (Fig. 6), and kidney tubular cells (Fig.8).

•

ACIS KEPTIDETM improves the pulmonary (Fig. 5) and renal pathological changes (Fig.
7) caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus insult.

•

Intranasal administration of 0.05% Beta-propiolactone (βPL)-inactivated SARS-CoV2 (1
*106) causes significant death (28%) in K18-hACE2 humanized mice after 24 hrs of
intranasal inoculation (Supplemental videos) suggesting that SARS-CoV2 does not
require its infective properties and genetic mechanism to be functional to cause mortality.

•

The peptide backbone of ACIS KEPTIDETM provides much less and insignificant
protection in the prevention of pathological changes in Lungs (Fig.5 & 6) and Kidney
(Fig.7 & 8). Peptide failed to normalize the upscaled expression of ACE-2 in kidney tubular
cells (Fig.8) of SARS-CoV2-treated K18-hACE2 mice.

Abstract: Previously, we have demonstrated that ACIS KEPTIDETM, a chemically modified
peptide, selectively binds to ACE-2 receptor and prevents the entry of SARS-CoV2 virions in vitro
in primate kidney Cells. However, it is not known if ACIS KEPTIDETM attenuates the entry of
SARS-CoV2 virus in vivo in lung and kidney tissues, protects health, and prevent death once

applied through intranasal route. In our current manuscript, we demonstrated that the intranasal
administration of SARS-CoV2 (1*106) strongly induced the expression of ACE-2, promoted the
entry of virions into the lung and kidney cells, caused acute histopathological toxicities, and
mortality (28%). Interestingly, thirty-minutes of pre-treatment with 50 μg/Kg Body weight ACIS
normalized the expression of ACE-2 via receptor internalization, strongly mitigated that viral
entry, and prevented mortality suggesting its prospect as a prophylactic therapy in the treatment of
COVID-19. On the contrary, the peptide backbone of ACIS was unable to normalize the
expression of ACE-2, failed to improve the health vital signs and histopathological abnormalities.
In summary, our results suggest that ACIS is a potential vaccine-alternative, prophylactic agent
that prevents entry of SARS-CoV2 in vivo, significantly improves respiratory health and also
dramatically prevents acute mortality in K18-hACE2 humanized mice.
Introduction: COVID-19, a severe acute respiratory disease [1, 2], is primarily caused by a viral
strain named as Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) [3]. As an entry mechanism of the virus into host
cell, A recent study [4] has demonstrated that SARS-CoV2 employs its membrane-bound “Sglycoprotein” to attach with the host receptor ACE-2. Although, other mechanisms such as
attachment of virus to the polysaccharide molecule heparan sulphate [5] in the cell membrane also
facilitates the infectivity of the virus, until now, the interaction of SARS-CoV2 with ACE-2 protein
has been considered as a primary mechanism of viral entry [6] [7].
In our previous study [8], we reported that ACIS KEPTIDETM, a chemically modified peptide with
a strong affinity towards ACE-2 receptor, efficiently nullified the interaction between ACE-2 and
S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV2. As a result, the entry of the SARS-CoV2 virions into host cells
had been severely impaired. Based on the results derived from different experiments such as
cytopathic effect assay, plaque assay and dual immunofluorescence analyses, we concluded that
3

ACIS KEPTIDETM indeed inhibited the attachment and entry of SARS-CoV2 virions in VEROE6
primate kidney cells. Moreover, our results also demonstrated that the chronic administration of
KEPTIDE through intranasal pathway did not cause the loss of body weight, changes in vitals
including body temperature, oxygen saturation, and heart rate nullifying any health-related toxicity
due to KEPTIDE-treatment. Although that experiment was performed in aged BALB/C mice,
understanding the toxicity of KEPTIDE is warranted in better animal model that express human
ACE-2 receptor.
Therefore, in our current work, we included 6-8 weeks old K18-hACE2 mice. This strain is a
humanized strain that express human ACE-2 receptor under the guidance of K18 promoter. K18hACE2 mice display an acute lung and kidney injuries resulting significant mortality upon
inoculation with SARS-CoV2 [9-11]. Therefore, to avoid significant mortality in these mice and
for the safety of users, we inactivated virus with 0.05% beta-propiolactone (βPL). Although the
treatment with 0.05% β-propiolactone has been reported to substantially reduce the infectivity of
the virus, the ultrastructure of the external capsid remains unaltered and its antigenicity is also
preserved [12, 13] that allows us to perform the entry experiment of SARS-CoV2 in lung tissue.
To explore the effect of ACIS on preventing the entry of virions, we performed an in vivo
experiment with the intranasal treatment of ACIS for 30 minutes followed by the intranasal
inoculation of SARS-CoV2 for another 24 hrs. Next, we performed an array of experiments in
lungs and kidney of these humanized animals to confirm the role of ACIS KEPTIDE in the entry
of virions through ACE-2 receptor, the regulation of ACE-2 receptor, amelioration of acute
histopathological changes, and mortality.

Results:
Exploring toxicity in K18-hACE2 animals after chronic intranasal administration of ACIS
KEPTIDETM. Eight to 10 weeks old K18-hACE2 mice (n=8; 4 males and 4 females) were
intranasally administered with 50 μg/Kg Bwt KEPTIDE every day for 10 days as described under
method section. Average baseline body weights were 18.25±1.4 gms and 15.65± 2.3 gms for males
and females, respectively. Each day animals were recorded for body weight (Fig. 1A), body
temperature (Fig. 1B), heart rate (Fig. 1C), and oxygen saturation (Fig. 1D) as described previously
[8] . As evident from figure 1A, both male and female mice maintained their body weights
throughout the study. On average, there was a decrease in body weight (14.59 ± 2.32) recorded in
female mice on day 9 that happened most likely due to the loss of water-weight. However, that
drop was not statistically significant while comparing with the baseline value (p>0.05; =0.2015).
On contrary, male mice did not display any loss in body weights. Instead, we observed consistent
increase in body weights from day 6. Again that increase was not statistically significant once
compared with the baseline value (p>0.05; =0.0762). Daily administration of KEPTIDE did not
alter body temperature (Fig. 1B), heart rate (Fig. 1C), and oxygen saturation (Fig. 1D). There was
only partial and non-significant elevation of blood pressure on day 9 (baseline value of 448± 12.5
to 489± 10.7) in all females, otherwise all vital parameters were found to be stable. No mortality
was observed across the study in any animal.
ACIS KEPTIDETM prevented the mortality and protected health of SARS-CoV2-infected
K18-hACE2 mice. Since ACIS did not display any mortality and health-related issue in K18hACE2 mice, next we wanted to study if ACIS could also prevent the death and improve healthassociated toxicities in these mice upon exposure to SARS-CoV2 virions. Wuhan-standard SARSCoV2 is highly infectious and therefore complete inactivation of virus is required in order to

minimize the health risk associated with the administration procedure, perfusion, surgery, postsurgical processing of tissue, and histological analyses. Accordingly, the inactivation was
performed with incubating viral stock with 0.05% βPL as described elsewhere [13] and also
mentioned under method section. Based on our plaque assay (Supplementary Fig. 1), we
determined that 0.05% βPL indeed significantly inactivated the SARS-CoV2 virus.
In order to assess the protective role of ACIS KEPTIDE in the entry of SARS-CoV2 in lung
epithelium, 8-10 weeks old K18-hACE2 mice (n=8 per group; 4 males and 4 females) was
inoculated with 50 μg/Kg bwt ACIS intranasally for 30 minutes followed by the administration
inactivated 1X106 SARS-CoV2 virus particles. Thirty minutes of pre-incubation with ACIS was
justified based on our result of immunofluorescence analyses performed in vitro in human lung
epithelial cells Calu-3. We observed that thirty minutes of exposure to 25 μM of ACIS strongly
induced the internalization of ACE-2 receptor in human Calu-3 lung cells and continued to
downregulate the de novo expression of ACE-2 receptor (Fig. 2) for 1, 2 and 6 hours of incubation.
Based on that result, we decided to pre-treat the mice (n=8 per group) with 50 μg/Kg Bwt
KEPTIDE for 30 mins followed by the treatment with 1 *106 virus for 24 hrs. After another 24
hrs, mice were analyzed for the vital signs of health and mortality. After 24 hrs, we observed
following.
First, there was significant mortality (28%; 2 out of 7 animals) in virus-treated animals. Two
females (66%; 2 out of 3 females) died (Supplementary video 1). Second, virus-treatment caused
significant loss of body temperature (Fig. 3A). Third, another striking feature is abrupt loss of body
weight (Fig.3D). One male showed 8 gm loss of body weight (26 gm day 0 to 18 gm day post
inoculation; tail mark1 male). Otherwise, across the virus-treatment group there was average 3.04
± 2.54 gms of body weight loss (Fig. 3D). However, there was no statistical significance (p>0.05)

while measuring significance of mean between groups with paired t test as because the sample size
changed due to mortality. All virus-treated mice are moribund, with low body temperature (Fig.
3A), abnormally low heart rate (Fig. 4A;

saturation less than 95%; ***p<0.005), and motor impairment. All mice displayed severe physical
discomfort as evident with hunched posture, scruffy skin, frequent shivering, and hindlimb
dragging (Supplemental video 1).
Interestingly, KEPTIDE-treated and virus-infected mice displayed no mortality (Supplementary
video 2), normal body temperature (Fig. 3B), body weight (Fig. 3E), heart rate (Fig.4B), and
Oxygen saturation (Fig. 4E). Skin tone is normal with shiny fur. Mice did not show any motor
impairment and no physical discomfort such as frequent shivering, curved posture and hind limb
dragging. Male and female mice dis not display any gender biasness in terms of health and
mortality. There was no change in body weight.
In contrast, peptide-(same amino acid sequence backbone, but no Knock-End tagging and
neutralization) treated & virus-treated mice (n=8) did not display any mortality (Supplementary
video 3) but significant impairment in movement ( 2 out of 4 male and 2 out of 4 female) as
indicated with hunchback posture, frequent shivering, scruffy skin and dizziness. These mice
display decreased body temperature (Fig. 3C;

heart rate (Fig. 4C; *p<0.05), and severe respiratory stress (Fig. 4F; *p<0.05). Taken together our
results suggest that even after significant attenuation of infectivity, βPL-treated SARS-CoV2 virus
is still able to cause acute health issues and mortality.
ACIS KEPTIDE prevented SARS-CoV2-induced acute histopathological changes in lungs
and kidneys of K18-hACE2 mice. Since intranasal inoculation of βPL-inactivated virus caused
significant health toxicity and pre-treatment of ACIS KEPTIDE, but not peptide, dramatically

prevented the health issues, next we wanted to analyze the histopathological abnormalities in lungs
and kidneys in virus-treated animals. We were also interested to analyze if ACIS KEPTIDE
prevented these abnormalities. Therefore, we first performed hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining
in paraffin-embedded lungs and kidney sections of vehicle-, virus-, virus +KEPTIDE, and
virus+peptide-treated groups. A detailed analysis in H&E-stained slides demonstrated that
intranasal inoculation of βPL-treated virus, but not βPL-treated uninfected VERO sup (vehicle;
Fig. 5A), caused the swelling of alveolar parenchyma with increased number of cells (Fig. 5B).
Interestingly, thirty-minutes pre-treatment of 50 μg/Kg Bwt KEPTIDE (Fig. 5C), but not its
peptide backbone (Fig. 5D), significantly protected the alveolar space, thickness of the alveolar
wall and cellularity of alveolar parenchyma. Further analyses of bronchiolar epithelium revealed
that virus treatment (Fig. 5F & Fii), but not vehicle (Fig. 5E & Ei), significantly damaged the
integrity of the epithelial membrane with hemorrhagic response in the surrounding pulmonary
blood vessels. On the other hand KEPTIDE pre-treatment not only protected the integrity of the
bronchiolar epithelium (Fig. 5G & Giii), but also prevented hemorrhagic response. Interestingly,
peptide treatment could not block the virus-mediated damage of bronchiolar epithelium (Fig. 5H
& Hiv) and pulmonary hemorrhagia.
Is this KEPTIDE-mediated protection of acute toxicity due to the prevention of viral entry in lung
epithelium? To address this concern, we performed a dual immunohistochemical analyses of
ACE2 and Spike glycoprotein (Fig. 6). Surprisingly, twenty-four hour treatment with SARS-CoV2
significantly stimulated the expression of ACE-2 in the outer (Fig. 6 Bc) and inner layers (Fig.6
Bd) of bronchiolar epithelium compared to vehicle treatment (Fig, 6Aa & 6 Ab).This upregulation
of ACE-2 expression by SARS-CoV2 was unexpected and might facilitate the entry of virions
through lung epithelium [14]. Thirty-minutes pretreatment with ACIS KEPTIDE (Fig. 6Ce &

6Cf), but not peptide (Fig. 6Dg & 6Dh), strongly downregulated the expression of ACE-2 and
normalized its expression to the basal level. Accordingly, we observed the infiltration of SARSCoV2 in the bronchiolar parenchyma (brown arrow) in virus- and virus + peptide-treated groups,
whereas KETIDE treatment significantly protected the entry of virions (indicated with brown
arrow). The result was corroborated with the quantification of numbers of ACE-2-immunoreactive
(ir) cells in bronchiolar epithelium in all four groups (Supplementary Fig. 2A). To further evaluate
if these brown signals were not artifacts, we confirmed the size of these particles in reference to
eosin-stained nuclei. However, these viral particles were inactivated and therefore lost the
proliferative properties. As a result, the load of virions was not overwhelming in lung parenchyma.
ACIS KEPTIDETM prevents the entry of SARS-CoV2 in the Kidney Tubular Cells.
According to a recent report [15], tubular cells of Kidney strongly express ACE-2 receptors. Next,
we explored pre-treatment of ACIS was able to nullify the entry of SARS-CoV2 virions in renal
tubular cells. We observed that SARS-CoV2 ACIS (Fig. 7A), but not vehicle (Fig. 7B),
significantly altered the integrity of kidney cortex with the formation of vacuoles around
glomeruli, whereas ACIS KEPTIDE protected the integrity of kidney cortex (Fig. 7C) with
unaltered morphology of glomeruli , proximal and distal convoluted tubular cells. Surprisingly,
the kidney cortices of the peptide backbone-treated group displayed a hemorrhagic response (Fig.
7D). However, we did not observe any vacuolization in the kidney cortex of virus +peptide-treated
group. The result was further corroborated with the quantification data (Supplemental figure 2B).
Next, we monitored the regulation of ACE-2 receptor in kidney tubular cells and also evaluated
how that expression could alter the entry of virions in these cells. Interestingly, our dual IHC
analyses revealed that overnight inoculation of SARS-CoV2 virus indeed upregulated the
expression of ACE-2 in tubular epithelia (Fig. 8A & 8B; Supplementary Fig. 2B), whereas pre-

treatment of KEPTIDE (Fig. 8C), but not peptide (Fig. 8D) , normalized the expression of ACE-2
(Supplementary Fig. 2B). In addition to that, we also observed that pre-treatment with KEPTIDE
significantly inhibited the entry of SARS-CoV2-promoted entry of virions in kidney tubular cells
and also through Bowman’s capsule of glomerulus.
Discussion:
ACIS KEPTIDE stimulates the internalization and downregulation of ACE-2 receptor in Lung and
Kidney epithelial cells. Bronchiolar epithelium is composed of tightly attached epithelial cells that
are known to express wide-range of pattern recognition receptors dedicated to innate immune
response for providing defense against invading microbes [16]. Apart from immune protection
against microbes, these epithelial cells also strongly express ACE-2 [17], which is known for its
vasodilative action. Recent studies indicate that ACE-2 is a selective receptor for the entry of
SARS-CoV2 virions in lung epithelial cells. Upon binding to ACE-2, SARS-CoV2 virus gets
internalized to the cytosol of the epithelial cell to initiate the early pathogenic events [17, 18].
ACIS KEPTIDE was designed to selectively inhibit the binding of S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV2
with ACE2 and subsequently block the entry of SARS-CoV2 through ACE-2 receptor [8].
However, the effect of ACIS on the regulation of ACE-2 receptor is not known. In our present
manuscript, we explored the effect of ACIS on the expression and turn-over of ACE-2 receptors
in lung and kidney epithelial cells. First, our immunocytochemical analyses revealed that upon
binding, ACIS stimulated the internalization of ACE-2 receptor in vitro in cultured human lung
epithelial cells Calu-3. The effect was observed as early as 30 minutes treatment of 25 μM of
KEPTIDE resulting the consistent downregulation of ACE-2 expression over longer period of
incubation. Second, our dual IHC analyses indicated that SARS-CoV2 strongly induced the
expression of ACE-2 in bronchiolar epithelial cells and the thirty minutes pre-treatment of ACIS

efficiently normalized the virus-stimulated expression of ACE-2 in vivo in bronchiolar epithelial
cells. Third, similar treatment of ACIS KEPTIDE also dramatically inhibited the expression of
ACE 2 in vivo in renal tubular cells of K18-hACE2 mice. Fourth, pre-treatment with peptide
backbone of ACIS was unable to restore the expression of ACE-2 in virus-inoculated mice.
Combing all results, we confirmed that ACIS is a selective ACE-2 inhibitor that binds, internalizes,
and balances the expression of ACE-2 preventing the entry of SAR-CoV2 in the host cell.
ACIS KEPTIDE improves the pathological outcomes of SARS-CoV2-infected lung and kidney
tissue. Intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV2 virus displayed visible infiltration of SARS-CoV2
cells in the bronchiolar epithelial boundaries, alveolar parenchyma, and renal tubular cells of
kidney. Interestingly, thirty minutes of pretreatment with ACIS not only downregulated the
expression of ACE-2, but also strongly mitigated the entry and cellular load of SARS-CoV2 in
bronchiolar epithelial cells analyzed twenty-four hours post inoculation of virus. In fact, twentyfour hours treatment of SARS-CoV2 caused the thickening alveolar parenchyma with increased
accumulation of mononuclear cells primarily inflammatory monocytes and macrophages. These
are the indices of the onset of lung inflammation. Interestingly, KEPTIDE treatment significantly
prevented the swelling and infiltration of inflammatory cells in small airway epithelium. Partial to
significant degeneration of bronchiolar epithelial cells was also observed in virus-treated group.
Surprisingly, KEPTIDE-treatment prevented the degeneration of these epithelial cells in virusinfected K18-hACE2 mice. We also observed increased vacuolization in kidney cortex with
glomerular swelling after twenty-four hours of virus treatment, which is frequently observed in
degenerative kidney [19, 20]. ACIS KEPTIDE significantly protected the kidney parenchyma with
decreased vacuolization and also protected glomerular swelling.

The infective property of SARS-CoV2 is not required for the death of COVID-19-infected animals.
One most important highlight of this paper is to identify a new mechanism of SARS-CoV2mediated death, which is entirely independent of its infective property. In our current project, we
adopted βPL-mediated attenuation of infectivity in virus. This process strongly minimizes the risk
of infection in users without compromising the purpose of our experiment, which is to measure
the interaction and entry of the virus through ACE-2 receptor. These processes require the
preservation of the 3D-structure of surface S-glycoprotein, that was not altered by βPL-treatment.
SARS-CoV2 virions were thoroughly inactivated with 0.05% βPL-treatment. for 18 hrs in 4°C.
After 18 hrs, the residual activity of βPL was neutralized with additional incubation at 37°C for 2
hrs. That process completely attenuated the infective property of virus. In accordance with the
previous finding [13], our CPE experiment demonstrated that after βPL-treatment, virus
completely lost its infective property. Interestingly, intranasal inoculation of that inactivated virus
(1 *106) significantly caused mortality in 28% of treated animals (2 out of 7) just after 24 hrs. The
death was observed only in female mice. In addition to that, we observed reduced body weight,
lowered body temperature, dropped oxygen saturation, and decreased heart rate in surviving
animals. This dramatic and unexpected toxic effect after 24 hrs of inoculation with inactivated
virus offered a paradigm shift in the molecular action of virus. Bpl-treated Inactivated virus does
not have abilities to infect, replicate and spread, even though our results have demonstrated that it
can cause substantial toxicity. Hence, our study identifies that the binding and modulation of ACE2 receptor with spike protein seem to be the most critical step of SARS-CoV2-mediated death and
toxicity. Upon binding, SARS-CoV2 might alter the physiological activity of ACE-2 receptor that
potentially cause cytotoxicity and death. Our current report suggests that SARS-CoV2 does not
require its traditional infective property to cause death.

The peptide backbone of ACIS KEPTIDE cannot display similar protection. We compared the
effects of KEPTIDE and its peptide backbone in improving lung and kidney pathologies in virusinfected K18-hACE2 mice. Several findings in this paper demonstrated that ACIS KEPTIDETM
displayed much stronger effect than its peptide backbone in terms of amelioration of lung and
kidney pathologies, improving vital parameters of health, and preventing acute death response. In
our previous report [8], we justified the significance of biochemical modification in the core
peptide backbone of ACIS. Our cell-free assays demonstrated that these modifications are critical
in order to enhance its binding affinity to ACE-2, physiological longevity, and robust absorption
through intranasal path. Combining our previous findings with current results, we conclude that
biochemical modifications of ACIS peptide backbone has significantly enhanced its protective
effect in preventing SARS-CoV2-mediated toxicities.
ACIS can be a vaccine alternative that exhibits prophylactic action against SARS-CoV2 infection.
Several lines of our paper demonstrated that ACIS KEPTIDE could be a vaccine alternative. First,
the pre-treatment with 50 μg/Kg Bwt of ACIS KEPTIDE for thirty minutes significantly protected
the acute toxicity by SARS-CoV2. Surprisingly, KEPTIDE treatment not only protected the loss
of body weight, temperature, heart rat, and oxygen saturation; but also prevented mortality.
Second, the pre-treatment with the peptide backbone of ACIS KEPTIDE was found to worsen the
vital signs of health in SARS-CoV2 infected animals. Although, no mortality was observed in
peptide-treated group, 50% mice were moribund with severe motor impairment. Third, our
immunohistochemical analyses of lung tissue revealed that the pre-treatment of ACIS KEPTIDE
significantly prevented virus-driven histopathological alterations such as swelling of alveolar
walls, integrity of bronchiolar epithelial membrane and hemorrhagic response in pulmonary
vessels. Fourth, pre-treatment of ACIS KEPTIDE was also observed to protect glomerular

integrity with decreased vacuolization in kidney cortices in SARS-CoV2-treated K18-hACE2
mice.
In summary, our current manuscript highlights the preventive role of ACIS KEPTIDE in the
protection of acute toxicity and death caused by SARS-CoV2 virus and also demonstrates a novel
mode of toxicity of SARS-CoV2, which does not require its genetic mechanism to be functional.

Materials and Methods:
Acquisition and Handling of Wuhan standard SARS-CoV2. Wuhan standard SARS-CoV-2
(2019-nCoV/USA_WA1/2020) was kindly provided to KK by World Reference Center for
Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (TX, USA). Coppe Healthcare solutions has retained the
approval, license and CDC-certification to handle SARS-CoV2 virus. Handling of viruses was
performed in accordance with CDC-approved guideline. To generate virus stocks, Vero E6 cells
were cultured in complete DMEM (+ 2% FCS), inoculated with virus at a MOI of 0.05. After 72
hrs, the virus-containing media was harvested, aliquoted, and kept at -80°C. Virus stock was
titrated with a routine plaque assay on Vero E6 cells as described previously [8, 21].
Virus inactivation and access to BSL-3 lab: SARS-CoV2 virus is infectious virus that can cause
severe respiratory stress and pneumonia if not inactivated. Our aim is to explore if KEPTIDE
blocks the entry of virus in lung cells. To perform this entry assay, the virus need not be in its
infective state. Additionally, the inactivation also minimizes the health risk of users. Therefore,
before virus administration, we performed the inactivation assay. Briefly, viral cells will be treated
with 0.05% βPL for 18 hrs in 4°C. After 18 hrs, the cells will be kept at 37°C for 2 hrs for complete
hydrolysis of βPL. That process will completely attenuate the infective property of virus and also
completely nullifies the risk of handling SARS-CoV2 virus. This protocol has been optimized and

laboratory. The entire procedure of virus inactivation was performed in BSL-3 laboratory at Coppe
laboratories. Coppe Lab has a dedicated Biosafety level 3 laboratory suite with one dedicated
hoods, centrifuge, cell culture microscope, hot-water bath, two incubators, and a sink built in a
secured containment room. Passage to that lab has entry through two sets of doors from access
corridors. A clothing change room (i.e. anteroom) was located in the passageway between the two
self-closing doors.
Acquisition, justification, treatment, and disposal of K18-hACE2 mice. Six weeks-old K18hACE2 mice (B6. Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J) were purchased from Jackson laboratories (Stock
#034860). Mice were housed in ventilated micro-isolator cages in an environmentally controlled
vivarium (7:00 A.M./7:00P.M. light cycle; temperature maintained at 21-23°C; humidity 35-55%).
Animals are provided standard mouse chow and water ad libitum and closely monitored for health
and overall well-being daily by the investigator and supervised by a certified veterinarian in
accordance with standard animal care guidelines. Before treatment, animals were transported to
Coppe Laboratories in sealed cages covered with drapes as explained in our approved animal
handling protocol. The entire virus inoculation work, perfusion and tissue collection were
performed in a negative-pressure room inside BSL-3 hood. The justification of including eight
animals per groups was derived with the following equation
𝑵 = [𝒛𝟐 × 𝒑(𝟏 − 𝒑] ÷ 𝜺𝟐 = [1.282 × 0.99 (1-0.99)] ÷ 0.052 = 7. N = sample size; Z = the z score,
which is 1.28 for power 0.8; p = population proportion. For 98% confidence interval, p will be
0.98 & (1-p) = 0.02; and 𝜺 is the margin of error =0.05. For unexpected outcome of the experiment,
additional 1 animal was included per group.
Once inactivated, these virus particles (1*106; stock conc = 2.5*107particles/ mL) were stored at
4°C overnight. On the day of experiment, mice were anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg) and

xylazine (5-7 mg/kg) mixture followed by the treatment with 50 μg/Kg Bwt KEPTIDE or peptide
through intranasal route. After 30 minutes, we performed inoculation of 1*106 virus in the nasal
cavity. The virus stock was loaded in a micropipette and then gently disposed in both the nostrils
by micropipette. After 24 hrs, animals were recorded for their vital health signs and then perfused
with PBS followed by 4% PFA.
The removal of biohazard waste product was performed using proper institutional safety
procedures. The perfusion waste was collected in a container that was thoroughly soaked with
bleach and half-filled with concentrated bleach solution. For disposal of animal carcass, BSL-3
containment is strictly adhered to with proper bleach sanitization, locked in bleach-soaked
biohazard bag, sealed with sealing threads, followed by placing into a potentially infectious
material red waste container in the dedicated morgue. Final removal was performed by SteriCycle
bio-waste disposal services.
Anatomy and Histopathological evaluations: The formalin-fixed lung and kidney tissues was
embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 μm thick sections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
method, and evaluated for the histopathological changes by certified pathologist in MacNeal
Hospital of Loyola Medicine. Histopathological changes in lung tissue such as infiltration of
monocytes in alveolar parenchyma, thickening of alveolar walls, hemorrhagic response in and
around pulmonary vessels, changes in bronchiolar epithelia were carefully scrutinized. Changes in
glomerular structure, vacuolization in kidney cortices were monitored while analyzing
pathological changes in Kidney tissue. Results were confirmed after evaluating n = 5-8 animals
per group.
Dual Immunohistochemical analyses: Five micron tissue sections were cut from paraffinembedded lung and kidney tissue, installed in charged slides, deparaffinized in xylene, and then

rehydrated through an ethanol gradient (100%, 95%, 80%, and 70%). The rehydrated slides were
blocked with 2% horse-serum followed by incubation with primary antibodies (Mouse anti-Sglycoprotein antibody, 1:200 dilution, Millipore, Cat # MAB5676; Rabbit anti-ACE2 antibody,
1:200 dilution, Abcam, Cat # ab272690) for 2 hrs. After that, slides were washed with TBS +
Tween (0.05%) solution for three times, incubated with mouse DAB- and rabbit AP-polymers for
1 hr, washed with TBS-T (X 3 ), reacted with DAB and AP substrates for color development, and
finally stained with hematoxylin for nuclei. Slides were mounted with aqueous mounting media to
preserve red color developed after AP reaction. Slides were thoroughly dried under air-blower at
70-80°C and imaged in a LOMO phase-contrast light microscope with ToupView 3.7 software.
The dual immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses was performed as described in manufacturer’s
protocol (Double Stain IHC Kit: M&R on human tissue; DAB & AP/Red; Cat # ab210059;
Abcam).
Immunofluorescence analysis in Calu-3 Cells: Calu-3, human lung epithelial cells, were
cultured in complete DMEM for 72 hrs to achieve 70-80% confluency.

After that, cells were

starved with serum-free media for 1 hr followed by the treatment with 25 μM KEPTIDETM for
different time points such as 30 mins, 60 mins, 2 hrs and 6 hrs. After each time, cells were fixed
with 4% PFA overnight. Next day, cells were thoroughly washed with PBST, incubated with
Rabbit-anti ACE2 antibody (1:200 dilution) for 2 hrs, washed with PBST (X 3), incubated with 2°
antibody [Alexa Fluor® 488 AffiniPure Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L); 1:200 dilution] for 1 hr,
washed , and then mounted with fluoromount media. Our KEPTIDE tag shows autofluorescence
at UV wavelength of 380-400 nm that enabled us to image slide in a dual channel under Olympus
BX51 fluorescence microscope.

Data collection, audiovisual recordings, and statistical analysis. Six to eight weeks old K18hACE2 mice (n=8; 4 males and 4 females) were included to explore the toxic effect of KEPTIDETM
treatment. Mice were administered intranasally with 50 μg/Kg bwt KEPTIDE every day for 10
days and health vitals were measured as described previously [8]. Animals were tail-marked with
marker pen before the treatment. Data of body weight, body temperature, heart rate, and O2
saturation were recorded in the notebook with date. Data were plotted in GraphPad Prism 8
software as XY scatter plots with X axis of “days” and Y axis of health variables.
Similarly, health parameters were recorded in notebook with dates after twenty-four hours of
SARS-CoV2 treatment and also in KEPTIDE- and peptide-treated SARS-CoV2-inoculated in
animals. Total 32 animals were shared in four different groups (vehicle only, virus only, virus +
KEPTIDE, and virus + Peptide) with 8 animals per group.
For video recording, iPhone 7 camera was used. The cage was kept inside BSL-3 hood all the time
with constant suction of air. BSL-3 room itself was located in a negative-pressure room. Users had
performed the recording after wearing the full PPE including, gown, masks, two-layers of gloves
holding cages far from the face. After video recording the phone was cleaned with bleach-soaked
wipes.
Quantitative estimation of ACE-2-ir cells in bronchiolar epithelia and Mean color intensity of CE2 expression in kidney tubular cells were performed in ImageJ software.
Data were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA in a GraphPad Prism 8 software considering the
treatment as a single factor. P-values were indicated with each figure to display the significance of
mean between groups.

Legends to Figures:
Fig.1. The effect of intranasally administered of ACIS KEPTIDE on the health parameters
of K18-hACE2 mice. (A) Eight-to-ten weeks old K18-hACE2 mice were administered
intranasally with ACIS KEPTIDE at a dose of 50 μg/Kg bodyweight for 10 days (n=8 per group;
4 males and 4 females). Different health parameters sch as (A) body temperature, (B) body weight,
(C) heart rate, and (D) oxygen saturation were monitored starting from day 0 to day 10. Results
are mean ± SEM of three different experiments. Significance of mean between two groups were
tested with paired t-test (p = 0.234 for body temperature; p = 0.00109841 for body weight; p =
0.0981 for heart rate and p = 0.7121 for oxygen saturation). Results are mean ± SEM of three
independent experiments.
Fig. 2. Effect of KEPTIDE on the Expression of ACE-2 Receptor on the Membrane of CALU3 Human Lung Cells. Human lung epithelial cells. CALU-3 cells were grown in complete DMEM
cells for 2 days until it reached 70% confluency followed by starving with serum for 2 hrs. After
that, 25 μM of ACIS KEPTIDE were treated for 30 mins, 1 hr, 2 hrs and 6 hrs. After each time
point cells were fixed and stained for ACE-2 (Green; Rabbit anti-ACE-2 antibody; Abcam; 1:250
dilution) and KEPTIDE (blue). Thirty minutes of KEPTIDE treatment significantly stimulated the
internalization of ACE-2 along with KEPTIDE. Subsequent incubation periods displayed
significant down-regulation of ACE-2 receptors. Experiments were confirmed after three different
experiments.

with 0.05% β-propiolactone as mentioned under method section. In group1 mice (n=7) were
inoculated with virus only; in group 2, mice (n=8) were treated with virus +KEPTIDE; and, in
group 3, mice (n=8) were treated with virus +peptide. After 24 hrs, significant mortality ( 2 females
of 7 mice) was observed in group 1, but not other groups. (A-C) Body temperature was monitored.
Both virus only- and virus+peptide-treated animals have significantly low body temperature once
compared with the baseline body temperature recorded one day before the procedure. (D-F) Body
weight was monitored in three groups one day before and after of procedure. No significant change
in body weight observed in group1 and 2, however peptide treatment could not protect the loss of
body weight due to virus inoculation. Mortality is the possible confounder in group1 while
measuring body weight. Results are mean ± SEM of 7-8 animals. Related p value with descriptive
t statistics were mentioned below each histogram.
Fig. 4. Effect of KEPTIDE on the Regulation of Heart Rate and O2 saturation in K18-hACE2 Humanized Mice Infected with SARS-CoV2 Virus for 24 hrs. Eight to ten weeks old K18hACE2 mice were intranasally administered with 50 μg/Kg Bwt KEPTIDE or 50 μg/Kg Bwt
peptide for 30 mins followed by inoculation with βPL-inactivated 1*106 virus. In group1 mice
(n=7) were inoculated with virus only; in group 2, mice (n=8) were treated with virus + KEPTIDE;
and, in group 3, mice (n=8) were treated with virus + peptide. (A-C) Body temperature was
monitored after 24 hrs. Both virus only- and virus+peptide-treated animals have significantly low
heart rate once compared with the baseline heart rate recorded one day before the procedure. (DF) Oxygen (O2) saturation was monitored in three groups one day before and after of procedure.
Significant change in O2 saturation observed in group1 and 3. Interestingly, KEPTIDE treatment
protected the respiratory health even after virus inoculation. Results are mean ± SEM of 7-8
animals. Related p value with descriptive t statistics were mentioned below each histogram.
