Abstract

29
30

Antibodies binding to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike

31

have therapeutic promise, but emerging variants show the potential for virus escape. Thus, there

32

is a need for therapeutic molecules with distinct and novel neutralization mechanisms. Here we

33

isolated a nanobody that potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, including the B.1.351 variant, and

34

cross-neutralizes SARS-CoV. We demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the nanobody in a

35

human ACE2 transgenic mouse model. Using biochemistry and electron cryomicroscopy we

36

show that this nanobody simultaneously interacts with two RBDs from different spike trimers,

37

rapidly inducing the formation of spike trimer-dimers. This naturally elicited bispecific

38

monomeric nanobody establishes a novel strategy for potent immobilization of viral antigens.

Introduction

43

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the vast societal and economic consequences of the connected

44

lockdowns have had devastating consequences for the world's populations. Despite rapid

45

progress in vaccine development, some emerging virus variants appear to be less effectively

46

neutralized by antibodies elicited by the first-generation vaccines 1 and the emergence of further

47

variants is expected. To prepare for different scenarios and to have emergency alternatives at

48

hand, novel ways to inhibit and neutralize the virus and variants of concern are needed. As

49

therapeutic agents in the early phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, camelid-derived single-domain

50

antibody fragments are promising candidates. These so-called 'nanobodies' not only bind their

51

antigen with very high specificity and affinity, but they can also be easily produced to large

52

quantities in E.coli 2 and show favourable biochemical characteristics, including good thermal

53

stability. Importantly, they can easily be combined to form homo- and heterodimers or other

54

multimers to increase potency and target multiple epitopes simultaneously 3–5. This strategy

55

allows the neutralization of multiple known or unknown virus variants and reduces the risk for

56

viral escape 5.

57

The attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to the host cell receptor ACE2 and subsequent membrane

58

fusion is mediated by the viral spike (S) protein 6. In the prefusion conformation, the spike is a

59

large homotrimer. Each S monomer consists of two subunits: S1 and S2. The S1 subunit contains

60

the receptor binding domain (RBD) and S2 contains the fusion peptide, as well as the

61

transmembrane domain. The RBD is responsible for the initial attachment to ACE2 and is found

62

in two distinct conformational states: The receptor-accessible 'up' conformation and the receptor

63

inaccessible 'down' conformation 6,7. Receptor binding induces the rather unstable 3-up state,

64

which leads to shedding of S1 and refolding of S2 thereby presenting the fusion peptide to the

65

opposing membrane 6,8,9. SARS-CoV-2 is easily neutralized by high-affinity binding antibodies

66

and other spike-targeting molecules, including nanobodies 10–13. Many of them bind to, or close

67

to, the receptor binding motif of the RBD and neutralize by directly hindering virus attachment

68

14,15

69

productive fusion 5,16. Still, the emergence of new virus variants that evade antibody-mediated

70

neutralization mandates the identification of molecules with a more diverse set of binding

71

epitopes and neutralization mechanisms allowing for neutralization of a variety of virus variants.

72

Here, we generated a nanobody that has two non-overlapping interaction sites on the SARS-

73

CoV-2 RBD, each targeting a different epitope, which induces the formation of dimers of spike

74

trimers and suppresses SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.

. Other mechanisms include locking the RBDs in the down conformation or preventing

Results

78

Isolation and characterization of a potent RBD-specific nanobody.

79

To identify nanobodies with unique neutralization potential, we immunized one alpaca (Funny)

80

with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and recombinant RBD. We isolated RNA from peripheral blood

81

mononuclear cells and created phagemid libraries. Phage display screens with immobilized RBD

82

yielded one promising nanobody, called Fu2. Since multimerization of nanobodies can

83

substantially improve virus neutralization potency 3,17, we created three different dimers

84

(illustrated in Fig. 1A): One Fu2-Fc fusion, expressed in mammalian cells, the second a

85

chemically linked Fu2 homodimer, and thirdly a heterodimer of Fu2 with a previously described

86

RBD-specific neutralizing nanobody Ty1 14. Chemically linked constructs were generated using

87

a combination of sortase A labelling and Cu-free click-chemistry as described in detail

88

previously 3.

89

Using pseudotyped lentivirus (PSV) neutralization assay (Fig. 1B), we found that monomeric

90

Fu2 was approximately 10-times more potent than Ty1, with an IC50 in the range of 106 ng/ml (7

91

nM). The Fu2-Fc fusion only slightly increased the neutralization potency of this nanobody to 61

92

ng/ml (0.75 nM), and a chemical homo-dimerization to an IC50 of 26 ng/ml (0.8 nM). Thus, the

93

observed enhancement in potency is attributable to dimerization, rather than the Fc-domain itself.

94

Interestingly, the Fu2-Ty1 heterodimer was extremely potent, with an IC50 approximately 6-fold

95

lower than that of the Fu2 homodimer, in the range of 4 ng/ml (140 pM). Fu2 directly prevented

96

spike binding to ACE2 as confirmed by flow cytometry of HEK293T-hACE2 cells stained with

97

recombinant, fluorescently labelled spike (+/- Fu2) (Fig. 1C). Analysis of binding kinetics by

98

surface plasmon resonance (SPR) revealed that Fu2 bound the RBD with sub-nanomolar affinity

99

(Fig. 1D). The 1:1 binding model fit the sensorgrams well at the used concentration range,

100

indicating a single dominant interaction. Analysis of next-generation sequencing data for other

101

members of the Fu2 lineage yielded several Fu2-variants with similar properties (Supplementary

102

Fig. 1A-E).

103

To test the integrity of the recombinant spike protein after the addition of Fu2, we analysed the

104

size-exclusion chromatography elution profiles in combination with different nanobody

105

constructs (Fig. 1E). The SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer eluted in a single peak and the addition of

106

Ty1 14 did not result in a shift in the position of this peak, which is expected given the small

107

relative size addition of the 14 kDa nanobody to the large (>400 kDa) spike trimer. In contrast,

108

the addition of Fu2 resulted in a substantial shift of the peak, suggesting the formation of a larger

109

complex, likely a dimer of the spike trimer. Next, we combined the spike with the Fu2-Ty1

110

heterodimer. This also resulted in earlier elution, and besides a possible spike dimer, this

111

construct gave rise to an even earlier elution peak suggesting the induction of higher-order spike

112

multimers.

113
114

Structural basis for Fu2 induction of spike trimer dimers.

115

To better understand neutralization and the aggregation of spike by Fu2, we used electron

116

cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure of the Fu2-spike complex. The structure

117

revealed a remarkable head-to-head dimerization of the trimeric spike, bound by six molecules of

118

Fu2 (Fig. 2). This distinct structural state appeared as prominent 2D classes in our analyses (Fig.

119

2A). Binding of Fu2 to the RBD is unique as it can simultaneously interact with two different

120

RBDs from different spike trimers in the up conformation (Figs. 2B and 2C). To our knowledge,

121

Fu2 is the only nanobody or spike-binding molecule developed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike

122

to have this property. Our high resolution (2.9Å; 0.143 FSC) localized reconstruction of the

123

RBD-Fu2-RBD-Fu2 interface helped us elucidate the molecular details of this interaction. Each

124

RBD in the complex provides two binding interfaces for two Fu2 molecules, which we call

125

‘interface-major’ and ‘interface-minor’ according to surface area covered (Fig. 2D and

126

Supplementary Fig 2A and Supplementary 2B). The interface-major and interface-minor have a

127

buried surface area of ~740 Å2 and ~495 Å2, respectively. Parts of the Fu2 framework regions

128

drive the dimerization by shape-complementarity and coupled solvent exclusion in the two

129

interfaces. In addition, the interface-major consists of 15 hydrogen bonds and one salt bridge

130

between Fu2 D117 and RBD K378, while the interface-minor comprises five hydrogen bonds.

131

Furthermore, a region around the Fu2 b-turn A40-K43 plays a key role in dimerization through

132

interactions with two proximal RBDs (Supplementary Figs. 2C and 2D). Specifically, one of the

133

two proximal RBDs’ T500-Y505 region packs against the Fu2 A40-K43 b-turn and the RBD

134

Y505 is in addition bound by Fu2 Q39. Meanwhile, the other proximal RBD is bound through a

135

bidentate hydrogen bond between Fu2 E44 and the backbone amides of RBD V503-G504 (Fig.

136

2E and Supplementary Figs. 2C and 2D). Interestingly, the overall structure of Fu2-bound spike

137

had no significant deviations from previous structures (Supplementary Fig. 3) and we did not find

138

any contact between any two Fu2 molecules or between spike trimers suggesting that the

139

observed spike trimer dimerization is solely driven RBD-Fu2 interactions.

140
141

Fu2 blocks the RBD from binding ACE2.

142

Structural alignment of an ACE2-RBD structure to the Fu2-spike structure (single RBD) shows

143

that binding of ACE2 would be hindered by Fu2 bound to any of the two interfaces (Fig. 2F).

144

Fu2 bound to the interface-major would clash with ACE2 residues ~303-331 and the N-glycan at

145

position 322, while Fu2 bound to interface-minor would mask the interaction surface of ACE2,

146

making it sterically impossible for ACE2 to access the RBD. A comparison of the Fu2 and Ty1

147

binding site revealed that interface-minor is partially shared between Ty1 and Fu2 (Supplementary

148

Figs. 2E and 2F), suggesting that in context of the Fu2-Ty1 heterodimer, Ty1 is displaced upon

149

dimerization of the spike trimer. Ty1 can then potentially bind additional spike molecules,

150

explaining the elution profile showing both dimers and higher order spike complexes (Fig. 1E).

151

In the complex, Fu2’s long CDR3 (G99 to Y120) plays a significant role in RBD binding. Here,

152

the Fu2 S107-R111 region adopts a b-strand conformation that binds the RBD T376-Y380 b-

153

strand to give rise to an energetically favourable inter-chain extension of the RBD anti-parallel

154

b-sheet (Figs. 2G and 2H). Interestingly, the Fu2 CDR1 (G26-Y32) and CDR2 (T52-S57) do not

155

participate in RBD binding, and none of the CDRs is directly involved in the formation of the

156

spike dimer.

157
158

Fu2 stabilizes the RBD in the ‘up’ conformation.

159

Cryo-EM analyses, both of the purified spike or of intact virions has revealed that unliganded

160

spike is mostly present in all-down (~60%) or 1-up (~40%) conformation 6. Our Fu2-spike

161

structure shows the presence of two trimeric spike molecules, both in the 3-up conformation.

162

This arrangement allows Fu2 to access all six possible binding sites on RBDs without steric

163

conflict. Alignment of RBD-Fu2 to RBD-down in a 2-up spike structure confirms that binding of

164

Fu2 to RBD in the down conformation is not possible (Supplementary Fig. 2G). Fu2 bound to

165

either interaction interface on an RBD in the down conformation would clash with neighbouring

166

RBDs. Likewise, an alignment of the 2-up spike structure to the Fu2-trimer-dimer shows that

167

RBD-down would clash with the neighbouring Fu2 molecule (Supplementary Fig. 2H). In

168

conclusion, for Fu2 binding and for trimer-dimer assembly, all RBDs must be in the up

169

conformation.

Fu2-Ty1 provides therapeutic relief in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection

172

An important requirement for the development of antivirals is neutralization potential in vivo. To

173

address this, we used K18-hACE2 transgenic mice that express human ACE2 as a model for

174

SARS-CoV-2 infection. To determine if neutralizing nanobodies could prevent infection, or

175

reduce disease severity when administered in early infection, we performed a prophylactic and a

176

therapeutic experiment in vivo (Fig. 3). Mice in the prophylactic treatment group (N=4) were

177

injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 370 µg of the Fu2-Ty1 heterodimer (11-20 mg/kg), 6 h

178

before intranasal challenge with 103 plaque forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2. The

179

therapeutic group (N=4) was injected i.p. with 280 µg (9-14 mg/kg) of Fu2-Ty1 daily, for four

180

days, starting 24 h post infection. Viability and weight change were monitored daily for 12 days

181

post-challenge. Weight loss for infected mice was first observed on day 4. Prophylactic treatment

182

did not greatly alter weight loss or disease severity. In contrast, weight loss was delayed in mice

183

receiving Fu2-Ty1 heterodimers on a therapeutic regimen (10% weight loss endpoint, p<0.05,

184

Cox Proportional Hazard model). One of four mice treated post infection fully recovered from

185

infection with an otherwise-lethal challenge dose, with weight rebounding to pre-infection levels.

186

From day 6 oropharyngeal samples, qPCR of SARS-CoV-2 E-gene showed significantly reduced

187

genomic and subgenomic RNA in the therapeutic group compared to the untreated (Fig. 3C). The

188

data shows that the Fu2-Ty1 dimer suppresses SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.

Fu2 cross-neutralizes SARS-CoV, and clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 including the

191

B.1.351 variant of concern

192

To test the breadth of neutralization, we evaluated cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV PSV (Fig.

193

4A). While Ty1 did not neutralize SARS-CoV, Fu2 and dimeric Fu2 constructs were

194

neutralizing, but less so than against SARS-CoV-2 PSV. Interestingly, the neutralization curves

195

displayed a much flatter slope as compared to those against SARS-CoV-2 PSV. It required 6.1

196

µg /ml of monomeric Fu2 to reach 50% neutralization in this assay, while 570 ng /ml of Fu2-Fc

197

and 57 ng/ml of the Fu2-dimer was sufficient for 50% neutralization.

198

To understand the molecular mechanism of cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV we compared the

199

RBD sequences and performed structural alignments (Figs. 4B, 4C and Supplementary Fig. 4A).

200

Interestingly, the interface-major residues are conserved, while interface-minor has significant

201

differences, suggesting that the divergent interface-minor of SARS-CoV RBD would not permit

202

Fu2 binding. From these analyses we conclude that Fu2 binding would be unlikely to form

203

SARS-CoV trimer dimers.

204

To demonstrate neutralization of replication competent SARS-CoV-2 we performed a plaque

205

reduction neutralization test (PRNT) using infectious SARS-CoV-2, isolated from the first

206

Swedish COVID-19 patient 18 (Fig. 4D). Similar to neutralization of PSV, monomeric Fu2

207

neutralized SARS-CoV-2 much better than Ty1, a dimeric construct of Fu2 provided a 2.8-fold

208

improvement over the monomeric version of Fu2, while the heterodimer of Ty1 and Fu2 showed

209

a 50-fold improvement compared to monomeric Fu2 in this assay.

210

A PRNT using the B.1.351 (501Y.V2) 1 variant showed that Fu2 very potently neutralized this

211

novel variant (Fig. 4E) and that the Fu2 dimer and Fu2-Fc again improved neutralization

212

efficiency. The IC50 values were even slightly better than when using the Swedish isolate, but the

213

difference is within the intraassay variability. Ty1 failed to neutralize this virus, and the Fu2-Ty1

214

heterodimer did not neutralize better than Fu2 alone. The variant B.1.351 harbours four amino

215

acid substitutions in the RBD at position K417N, N439K, E484K and N501Y. Only N501 and

216

E484 are located in proximity of the Fu2 interaction interface. In silico analyses with the PISA

217

server (25) confirmed that the two interfaces do not change in these mutants. Both buried surface

218

areas of the interfaces as well as the number of possible hydrogen bonds remain unchanged (Fig.

9

219

4F). These results and analysis combined suggests that Fu2 likely also neutralizes the recently

220

emerged variants P1 (K417T, E484K, N501Y) and B.1.1.7 (N501Y).

221
222

Discussion

223

Nanobodies represent a valuable alternative to monoclonal antibodies for virus neutralization

224

19,20

225

with straight-forward functionalization and multimerization possibilities, make them suitable

226

candidates for therapeutic applications.

227

The newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant shows nine amino acid changes in the spike

228

protein. While biological properties of this variant remain to be determined, two amino acid

229

substitutions in the receptor binding motif are of potential concern for vaccine efficacy,

230

neutralization efficiency of existing monoclonal antibody therapies, and changed dynamics of

231

virus spread 21–23. The novel nanobody described here, Fu2, can effectively neutralize the

232

B.1.351 variant and has therefore a strong and unique potential to form the basis for development

233

of therapeutic interventions against this emerging variant of concern.

234

Fu2 is also capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV, highlighting its specificity for a more conserved

235

epitope. However, the potency was significantly reduced for the monomeric nanobody, likely

236

because of decreased affinity to the RBD of this virus. That the dimeric constructs significantly

237

increased potency further supports this hypothesis. A similar observation was made for VHH-72

238

originally developed against SARS-CoV, but with some neutralization potential in dimeric form

239

against SARS-CoV-2 24.

240

Nanobodies typically have short serum half-lives, ranging from 1-3 hours 25, compared to 6-8

241

days of IgG1 26. We show that a high dose of nanobody heterodimer is not suitable as a molecule

242

for passive immunization as it did not diminish the severity of disease of hACE2 expressing

. Their ease of production, thermal stability, and robust biochemical behaviour, combined

243

mice. In contrast, if administered daily for four days post challenge, the heterodimer significantly

244

delayed disease onset and severity, suggesting that nanobodies and dimeric nanobody constructs

245

have the potential for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy. Half-life extending strategies such as

246

fusion to serum albumin moieties could be used to extend half-life 27 and reduce the number of

247

infusions.

248

The RBD-specific nanobody Fu2 displays a particularly unique mode of virus neutralization by

249

rapidly inducing stable spike trimer dimers that are incapable of binding to ACE2. In contrast to

250

spike trimer dimers reported for the full-length spike that are based on S1-S1 interactions placing

251

the trimers ‘side-by-side’ 28, Fu2 induced a dimer in a ‘head-to-head’ orientation with the C-

252

termini at the distal ends. Targeting two epitopes increases the binding surface area, but, more

253

importantly, when locked in such a conformation the function of each glycoprotein is sterically

254

blocked both by the nanobody and by the other glycoprotein in such a way that the whole

255

complex must dissociate for the glycoprotein to regain its function.

256

The interaction between Fu2 and the RBD is highly unusual, and for a monomer to induce

257

antigen dimerization in this manner, two copies of an antigen must be bound at different epitopes

258

with precisely the right spatial arrangement. This novel mode of antigen binding may be

259

uncommon in naturally elicited antibody repertoires but could be achievable by structure-based

260

antibody design and might present a general strategy for potent immobilization of viral

261

glycoproteins and other antigens. It remains to be seen whether ‘designer’ bispecific monomer

262

nanobodies can push the potency envelope beyond what is currently attainable.

Materials and Methods

341
342

Cells and viruses.

343

HEK293T cell (ATCC-CRL-3216) and Vero E6 cells (ATCC-CRL-1586) were maintained in

344

DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a

345

humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C. The HEK293T cell line was further engineered to

346

overexpress human ACE2 by lentiviral transduction 14. All cell lines used for the experiments

347

were negative for mycoplasma as determined by PCR. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 18 and the

348

B.1.351 1 isolate were propagated in Vero E6 cells and titrated by plaque assay.

349
350

Proteins and probes.

351

The plasmid for the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized spike (2P) ectodomain

352

was a kind gift from the McLellan lab 6. The plasmid was used for transient transfection of

353

FreeStyle 293F cells using the FreeStyle MAX reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The spike

354

trimer was purified from filtered supernatant on Streptactin XT resin (IBA Lifesciences) or Ni-

355

NTA resin and purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 (Cytiva). For cryo-

356

EM a similar construct with 6 proline substitutions (S6-P) was used 30, and the protein was

357

purified on His-Pur Ni-NTA resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by size-exclusion

358

chromatography.

359

The RBD domain was cloned upstream of a sortase A motif (LPETG) and a 6xHIS tag. The

360

plasmid was used for transient transfection of FreeStyle 293F cells as described above. The

361

protein was purified from filtered supernatant on His-Pur Ni-NTA resin followed by size-

362

exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200.

363

Nanobodies were cloned in the pHEN plasmid with a C-terminal sortase motif (LPETG) and a

364

6xHIS tag. BL21 E. coli were transformed with this plasmid, and expression was induced with 1

365

mM IPTG at OD600 = 0.6 and cells were grown overnight at 30 °C. Nanobodies were retrieved

366

from the periplasm by osmotic shock and purified on Ni-NTA resin and size-exclusion

367

chromatography.

368

Sortase A 5M was produced as described before in BL21 E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA and

369

size exclusion chromatography 3.

370

Fluorescent spike ectodomain was generated by first attaching dibenzocyclooctyine-N-

371

hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (DBCO-NHS) to the spike trimer in a 3:1 molar ratio, before

372

attaching AbberiorStar-635P-azide by click-chemistry. The final product was purified from

373

unreacted DBCO and fluorophore on a PD-10 desalting column.

374

The biotinylated RBD was generated using sortase A and amine-PEG3-biotin as a nucleophile.

375

The reaction was performed with 50 µM RBD, 5 µM sortase A 5M, and 8 mM amine-PEG3-

376

biotin in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, for 6 hours at 4 °C. Sortase A and unreacted RBD

377

was removed on Ni-NTA resin and excess nucleophile was removed by two consecutive

378

purifications on PD-10 desalting columns.

379
380

Dimer generation using click chemistry.

381

To generate homo- and hetero-dimers, the different nanobodies were first site-specifically

382

functionalized on the C-terminus using sortase A with either an azide or a dibenzocyclooctine

383

(DBCO) as described in detail here 3. In brief, for functionalization with DBCO, 70 µM of

384

nanobody was incubated with 5 µM sortase A, 8 mM DBCO-amine (Sigma-Aldrich) in 150 mM

385

NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 and 10 mM CaCl2 for 3 h at 25 °C. To functionalize the nanobody

386

with an azide, 70 µM of nanobody, was incubated with 5 µM sortase A 5M, 10 mM 3-azido-117

387

propanamine (Sigma-Aldrich #762016) in 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 and 10 mM CaCl2

388

for 3 h at 25 °C. In both reactions, unreacted nanobody, sortase A and excess nucleophile were

389

removed using Ni-NTA resin and PD-10 columns or size-exclusion chromatography. The click

390

reaction was initiated by mixing azide and DBCO labeled nanobody in a 1:1 molar ratio for 48 h

391

at 4 °C. Dimers were purified from unreacted monomeric nanobody by size-exclusion

392

chromatography on a Superdex S200 16/600 column (Cytiva).

393
394

Alpaca immunization, library generation and nanobody isolation.

395

One adult female alpaca (Funny) at PreClinics, Germany, was immunized four times in a 60-day

396

immunization schedule. Each immunization consisted of two injections. For the first

397

immunization, 200 µg of prefusion stabilized spike and 200 µg of S1+S2 domain (Sino

398

Biologicals) was used. Remaining immunizations each consisted of one injection with 200 µg

399

RBD and one injection with 200 µg prefusion stabilized spike, both produced in Freestyle 293F

400

cells as described above. Serum from the final bleed at day 60 neutralized SARS-CoV-2

401

pseudoviruses with an ID50 >20 000. The animal study protocol was approved by the PreClinics

402

animal welfare officer commissioner and registered under the registration No. 33.19-42502-05-

403

17A210 at the Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety—LAVES

404

and is compliant with the Directive 2010/63/EU on animal welfare.

405

The nanobody phage library was generated as described 14. Phage display was performed on

406

RBD immobilized on magnetic beads.

411

(Addgene cat#8455), and a plasmid encoding either the SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 spike

412

protein, both harboring a C-terminal truncation of 18 amino acids. Media was changed 12-16 h

413

post-transfection, and pseudotyped viruses were harvested at 48 and 72 hours, filtered through a

414

0.45 µm filter and stored at -80 °C until use. Pseudotyped viruses sufficient to generate 100,000

415

relative light units (RLU) were incubated with serial dilutions of nanobody for 60 min at 37 °C.

416

15,000 HEK293T-ACE2 cells were then added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 48

417

h at 37 °C. Luminescence was measured using Bright-Glo (Promega) on a GM-2000

418

luminometer (Promega) with an integration time of 0.3 s.

419

Plaque reduction neutralization test: One day before the experiment, 100,000 Vero E6 cells were

420

seeded per well of a 24-well plate. A 3-fold serial dilution of the nanobody constructs starting at

421

10 µg/ml were incubated with 100 plaque-forming units (PFU) of the first Swedish clinical

422

isolate of SARS-CoV-2 or variant B.1.351 for 1 h at 37°C. The nanobody-virus mixture was then

423

added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS, and an overlay of

424

1% CMC/DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS was pipetted into the wells. Three days post-

425

infection, cells were fixed in 10% formaldehyde, followed by staining with crystal violet.

426

Plaques were counted and inhibition determined by comparing to control wells on the same

427

plate.

428
429

Flow cytometry

430

HEK293T-hACE2 cells were trypsinized and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. Cells

431

were stained with spike- AbberiorStar-635P not premixed or premixed with Fu2 or control

432

nanobody. Fluorescence was quantified using a BD FACSCelesta and the FlowJo software

433

package.

435

Gel shift assays

436

For gel shift assay, 80 µg of prefusion stabilized spike protein was incubated with or without

437

nanobody for 15 minutes and was run on a Superose 6 increase 10/300 GL (Cytiva), and

438

absorbance at 280 nm was detected. Sample and injection volumes were kept identical between

439

runs to obtain comparable elution profiles.

440
441

Next generation sequencing

442

Next generation sequencing on pre- and post-enrichment nanobody libraries was performed as

443

described in Hanke et al. 2020 14 on an Illumina MiSeq.

444
445
446

Surface plasmon resonance

447

Binding kinetics were determined by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore 2000. All

448

experiments were performed at 25 °C in a running buffer of 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH

449

7.4, and 0.005% Tween-20 (v/v). Site-specifically biotinylated RBD was immobilized on

450

streptavidin sensor chips (Series S sensor Chip SA, GE Healthcare) to a level of ~200 resonance

451

units (RU). A 2-fold dilution series of the nanobodies was injected at a flow rate of 30 µl/min

452

(association 180 s, dissociation 900 s), and the immobilized RBD was regenerated using 0.1 M

453

glycine-HCL buffer pH 2 for 2x 10 seconds. Data were analyzed using BIAevaluation Software

454

and fitted using the 1:1 Langmuir model with mass transfer.

department (KM-F) at Karolinska Institutet. Ethics for studies of virus infection and therapeutic

460

intervention were obtained from Stockholms Jordbruksverket (10513-2020). Mice were

461

prophylactically or therapeutically administered nanobodies as described in the main text and

462

challenged intranasally with 1000 PFU SARS-CoV-2 (Swedish isolate) in 40 µl PBS following

463

isoflurane sedation. Oropharyngeal sampling was performed at the indicated timepoints under

464

light anesthesia with isoflurane. Weight and general body condition was monitored daily until

465

weight drop started, whereupon mice were monitored twice daily. During the experiment, weight

466

loss, changes in general health, breathing, body movement and posture, piloerection and eye

467

health were monitored. Mice were typically sacrificed when they achieved 20% weight loss.

468

However, some mice were sacrificed before losing 20% in body weight, when movement was

469

greatly impaired and/or they experienced difficulty breathing that was considered to reach a

470

severity level of 0.5 on Karolinska Institutet’s veterinary plan for monitoring animal health.

RNA Extraction and RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

473

Viral RNA was isolated from buccal swabs collected on dpi 6 and stored in 500 µl of TRIzol™

474

Reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA extractions from buccal swab samples were performed using

475

an adapted TRIzol™ manufacturers protocol with a 45 min precipitation step at -20° C. RNA

476

pellets were resuspended in 20 µl of RNase-free water.

477

RT-PCR reactions were performed using 4 µl of resuspended RNA in a 20 µl reaction volume

478

using the Superscript III one step RT-qPCR system with Platinum Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen)

479

with 400 nM concentrations of each primer and 200 nM of probe. Primers and probes for the

Cryo-EM sample preparation and imaging

499

Spike trimer (1.8mg/ml) S6-P and Fu2 (2.1mg/ml) were mixed in a 1:6 molar ratio followed by

500

incubation on ice for 10 minutes. Prior to cryo-EM grid preparation, grids were glow-discharged

501

with 25 mA for 2 minutes using an EMS 100X (Electron Microscopy Sciences) glow-discharge

502

unit. CryoMatrix® holey grids with amorphous alloy film (R 2/1 geometry; Zhenjiang Lehua

503

Technology Co., Ltd) were used. 3 μl aliquots of sample solutions were applied to the grids and

504

the grids with sample were then vitrified in a Vitrobot Mk IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4°C

505

and 100% humidity (blot 10 s, blot force 3, 595 filter paper (Ted Pella Inc.)). Cryo-EM data

507

electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 kV in the Karolinska Institutet’s

508

3D-EM facility (https://ki.se/cmb/3d-em). Images were acquired in 165 kx nanoprobe EFTEM

509

SA mode with a slit width of 10 eV using a K3 Bioquantum during 1.5 s during which 60 movie

510

frames were collected with a flux of 0.81 e-/Å2 per frame (Supplementary Table 1). Motion

511

correction, CTF-estimation, Fourier binning (to 1.01 Å/px), picking and extraction in 600-pixel

512

boxes (size threshold 400 Å, distance threshold 100 Å, using the pretrained

513

BoxNet2Mask_20180918 model) were performed on the fly using Warp 34. Due to preferential

514

orientation, we collected a part of the dataset with 25-degree stage tilt.

515

A total of 14,081 micrographs were selected based on an estimated resolution cut-off of 4 Å and

516

defocus below 2 microns as estimated by Warp. Furthermore, Warp picked 1,035,962 particles

517

(dimer of trimeric spike with Fu2) based on above-mentioned criteria. Extracted particles were

518

imported into cryoSPARC v3.0.1 35 for 2D classification, 3D classification and non-uniform 3D

519

refinement. After 2D classification, clean classes with high-resolution features (and with

520

characteristic trimeric spike views) were retained and used to generate ab-initio 3D

521

reconstructions. In total 277,372 particles were retained for refinement steps and these particles

522

were processed with C1 symmetry (image processing scheme Supplementary Fig. 5).

523

These particles were further processed using heterogeneous refinement that resulted in a

524

reconstruction with high-resolution structural features in the core of the spike. One round of

525

homogeneous refinement was followed by non-uniform refinement. All final reconstructions

526

were analysed using 3D-FSC 36 and there were moderate anisotropy in the full map

527

reconstructions while the localized reconstruction displayed no significant anisotropy

528

(Supplementary Fig. 6A and 6B). All CTF refinements were per-particle CTF refinements

529

interspersed with global aberration correction (beamtilt, trefoil, tetrafoil and spherical

530

aberration). Please see Supplementary Table 1 for data collection and processing statistics and

the respective cryo-EM data processing schemes. For the Spike-Fu2 dimer interface we used a

532

particle set with partial-signal subtraction of all parts except for Fu2-RBD dimer interface

533

(containing two RBDs and two Fu2). From this we performed local reconstruction (non-

534

uniform). The local reconstruction resulted in a map with 2.89Å overall resolution as compared

535

to 3.2Å overall resolution for the full map.

537

Cryo-EM model building and structure refinement

538

The structure of the spike protein trimer PDB: 7KSG 5 was used as a starting model for model

539

building. A homology model for Fu2 was generated by swiss model 37 with PDB: 5LHN as

540

template (chain B) 38. Structure refinement and manual model building were performed using

541

COOT 39 and PHENIX 40 in interspersed cycles with secondary structure, Ramachandran,

542

rotamers and bond geometry restrains. Structure figures and EM density-map figures were

543

generated with UCSF ChimeraX 41 and COOT, respectively. Please see Supplementary Table 2

544

for refinement and validation statistics.

Supplementary Figures

Supplementary Fig. 1. Fu2 variants identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS) display
similar neutralization potential and binding kinetics. (A) Average difference of Fu2 variants
is shown as a tree diagram. (B) Fu2 and seven Fu2-variants were expressed in E.coli, purified,
and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. (C) A dilution series of Fu2 and its
variants were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus (PSV) for 1 hour at 37 °C
before infecting HEK293T-hACE2 cells. Neutralization (in %) compared to the untreated PSV is
shown. (D) Binding kinetics of Fu2 and variants to the RBD were measured by surface plasmon
resonance (SPR). Site-specifically biotinylated RBD was immobilized on streptavidin sensor
chips, and kinetics for a dilution series of the indicated monomeric nanobodies were measured.
Sensorgrams are color-coded based on concentration. The fit is based on the 1:1 Langmuir model
and is shown in dark grey solid lines. (E) Kinetic parameters of Fu2 and Fu2 variants binding to
the RBD.
