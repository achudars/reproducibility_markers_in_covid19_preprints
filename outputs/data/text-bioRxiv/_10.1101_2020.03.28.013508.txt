Abstract
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has reached more than 200 countries and territories worldwide.
Given the large requirement of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and considering that RNA extraction kits are in
short supply, we investigated whether two commercial RT-qPCR kits were compatible with direct SARSCoV-2 detection from nasopharyngeal swab samples. We show that one of the tested kits is fully
compatible with direct SARS-CoV-2 detection suggesting that omission of an RNA extraction step
should be considered in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.

Overview
Two coronaviruses, SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and MERS-CoV
(Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) caused large-scale severe respiratory syndromes in
humans in 2002 and 2013, respectively 1, 2. A recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China declared
in December 12th 2019 led to the isolation and identification of a new human coronavirus, 2019-nCoV
(SARS-CoV-2), as the responsible agent of this new acute respiratory syndrome 3. Since, SARS-CoV2 and the Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) have spread to more than 200 countries and territories
worldwide affecting more than 600,000 people (laboratory-confirmed cases) from which around 28,000
have died by COVID-19 4. As such, the WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on March
11th 2020 5. Given the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and that an important fraction of the
infected individuals remains asymptomatic but still spread the virus 6, rapid and extensive diagnosis
together with the isolation of infected individuals remains as one of the most powerful ways to avoid the
spread of new COVID-19 cases. There are several RT-qPCR protocols from different countries that are
currently approved by the WHO in order to detect SARS-CoV-2 7. However, one of the limiting steps of
such protocols is RNA extraction from clinical samples, which is currently performed by the use of a
limited quantity of approved RNA extraction kits. Since the current demand for those kits largely
exceeds their offer, it is necessary to develop alternative strategies allowing a rapid detection of the
virus. This becomes more important in middle- and low-income countries, which will not have massive
access to kit-based diagnosis 8, 9. In this sense, it was recently reported that the detection of SARSCoV-2 by RT-qPCR from a mixed sample could be achieved with non-approved kits but also in the
absence of an RNA extraction process 10. Here, we have extended these preliminary observations by
using an RNA extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 detection protocol from nasopharyngeal swab samples from
two COVID-19 diagnosed individuals using two commercially available and broadly used RT-qPCR kits.
Our data indicate that RNA extraction can be omitted from the protocol at least with one of the tested
kits allowing the rapid and reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 directly from nasopharyngeal swabs
samples.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 detection using RNA or direct nasopharyngeal swabs samples
Nasopharyngeal swabs samples (NSS) from two laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 positive individuals
(both confirmed by the Chilean Institute of Public Health) were obtained from the Servicio de Laboratorio
Clínico, Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile "Dr. José Joaquín Aguirre", Santiago, Chile.
FLOQswabs (Copan Diagnostics Inc) containing the nasopharyngeal samples were added to a 4 ml
tube containing 3 ml of UTM-RT mini transport media (Copan Diagnostics Inc). A volume of 5 µl of the
NSS was used to perform the RT-qPCR detection using the TaqMan™ 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v1
(ThermoFisher) and the 2019-nCoV CDC qPCR Probe Assay (Integrated DNA Technologies). RTqPCR detections using 5 µl of RNA extracted with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) were
processed in parallel in order to perform comparisons. In both cases, the cycling protocol recommended
by each supplier was used in the QuantStudio3 Real Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
using the samples obtained from the two COVID-19 positive individuals, the positive control provided
by each kit together with SARS-CoV-2-free RNA obtained from human embryonic kidney (HEK293T)
cells, which was used as a negative control.
We first tested the suitability of the TaqMan™ 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v1 to detect the SARS-CoV-2
genes Orf1ab, S and N (Fig. 1A and Table 1). We observed that the three viral genes were readily

detected in the NSS of both COVID-19 positive samples and the positive control but not in RNA from
HEK293T cells. Interestingly, detection of SARS-CoV-2 genes from the NSS was as efficient as RNA
samples extracted with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit with differences between 1 to 5 Ct values
depending on the viral gene and the sample (Fig. 1A and Table 1). These results strongly indicate that
the TaqMan™ 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v1 from Thermo Fisher Scientific is fully compatible with the direct
use of NSS without any RNA extraction step.
We then wanted to know whether these observations were extrapolable to the 2019-nCoV CDC qPCR
Probe Assay (Fig. 1B and Table 1). As observed, although we were able to detect the SARS-CoV-2 N
gene from the NSS using the N1 and N2 probes provided by the kit, our data indicate that this kit is
much more performant using RNA extracted samples. This observation was more evident with the N2
probe, in which we observed a difference of 13 Ct values between the NSS and the RNA extracted
samples from both patients (Fig. 1B and Table 1).
Conclusions
In summary, we have assayed the suitability of the TaqMan™ 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v1 from Thermo
Fisher Scientific and the 2019-nCoV CDC qPCR Probe Assay from Integrated DNA Technologies to
directly detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs samples from two COVID-19 positive
individuals diluted in transport media. Our results indicate that the kit from Thermo Fisher Scientific is
fully compatible with an RNA extraction-free protocol allowing the detection of viral RNA with an
efficiency comparable to that obtained using kit-extracted RNA. Our observations will be helpful to
support SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses in places such as the USA and Western Europe where COVID-19
cases have exploded during the last weeks but also in middle- and low-income countries, which would
not have a massive access to kit-based diagnosis.

Ethical statement
Given the important impact that data from this study could have on Public Health, the two
nasopharyngeal samples from COVID-19 positive patients were deidentified and not considered as
Human samples. We are currently, preparing a protocol to be presented at the Ethic Committee of the
Faculty of Medicine at Universidad de Chile in order to improve SARS-CoV-2 detection strategies using
a larger number of Human samples.
