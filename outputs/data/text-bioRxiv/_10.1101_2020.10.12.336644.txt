Abstract

19
20

Unprecedented sequencing efforts have, as of October 2020, produced nearly 200,000

21

genomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus

22

responsible for COVID-19. Understanding the trends in SARS-CoV-2 evolution is

23

paramount to control the pandemic, but analysis of this enormous dataset is a major

24

challenge. We show that the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over the course of the

25

pandemic is characterized primarily by purifying selection but a small set of sites,

26

including spike 614 and nucleocapsid 203-204 appear to evolve under positive

27

selection. In addition to the substitutions in the spike protein, multiple substitutions in the

28

nucleocapsid protein appear to be important for SARS-CoV-2 adaptation to the human

29

host. The positively selected mutations form a strongly connected network of apparent

30

epistatic interactions and are signatures of major partitions in the SARS-CoV-2

31

phylogeny. These partitions show distinct spatial and temporal dynamics, with both

32

globalization and diversification trends being apparent.

Main

36
37

High mutation rates of RNA viruses(1) enable virus adaptation at a staggering pace.

38

Nevertheless, robust sequence conservation indicates that purifying selection is the

39

principal force shaping the evolution of virus populations(2,3,4,5). The fate of a novel

40

zoonotic virus is in part determined by the race between public health intervention and

41

viral diversification. Even intermittent periods of positive selection can result in lasting

42

immune evasion, leading to oscillations in the size of the susceptible population and

43

ultimately a regular pattern of repeating epidemics, as has been demonstrated for

44

Influenza(6,7,8).

45
46

During the current coronavirus pandemic, understanding the degree and dynamics of

47

the diversification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is

48

essential for establishing a practicable, proportionate public health response, from

49

guidelines on isolation and quarantine to vaccination(9). To investigate evolution of

50

SARS-CoV-2, we aggregated all available SARS-Cov-2 genomes as of October 11,

51

2020, from the three principal repositories: Genbank(10), Gisaid(11), and CNCB(12).

52

From the total of 197,453 submissions in these databases, 82,592 unique SARS-Cov-2

53

genome sequences were identified, and 39,695 high quality sequences were

54

incorporated into a global multisequence alignment (MSA) consisting of the

55

concatenated open reading frames with stop codons trimmed. The vast majority of the

56

sequences excluded from the MSA were removed due to a preponderance of

57

ambiguous characters (see Methods). The sequences in the final MSA correspond to

58

73,236 isolates with date and location metadata.

59
60

Several methods for coronavirus phylogenetic tree inference have been tested(13,14).

61

The construction of a single high-quality tree from 40,000 30 kilobase (kb) sequences

62

using any of the existing advanced methods is computationally prohibitive. Therefore,

63

building on the available techniques, we assembled a set of maximally diverse subtrees

64

over a reduced alignment. This alignment was constructed mainly through the removal

65

of sites invariant up to the exception of a single sequence (see Methods). The omission

66

of these sites created additional sequence redundancy which was then eliminated by

67

removing additional sequences. The subtrees generated from the resulting MSA were

68

then used to constrain a single composite tree, both steps requiring a sophisticated

69

phylogeny reconstruction approach (see Methods). This composite tree reflects the

70

correct topology but has incorrect branch lengths and was in turn used to constrain a

71

global tree over the entire MSA (Fig. 1A). A complete reconstruction of ancestral

72

sequences was then performed by leveraging Fitch traceback(15) (see Methods),

73

enabling comprehensive identification of nucleotide and amino acid replacements

74

across the tree.

75
76

We identified 6 principal partitions within this tree, in general agreement with other

77

work(16,17,18), along with two region-specific clades within partitions 3 and 6 (Fig. 1A)

78

that, as discussed below, are important for the interpretation of the metadata. Given the

79

short evolutionary distances between SARS-CoV-2 isolates, the topology of the tree is a

80

cause of legitimate concern(14,19,20,21). For the analyses presented below, we rely on

81

a single, explicit tree topology which is probably one of many equally likely

82

estimates(14). Therefore, we sought to validate the robustness of the major partitions of

83

the virus genomes using a phylogeny-free approach. To this end, pairwise Hamming

84

distances were computed for all sequences in the MSA and the resulting distance

85

matrix was embedded within a 3-dimensional subspace using classical multidimensional

86

scaling (Fig. 1B). In this embedding, all 6 partitions are nearly completely separated,

87

and the optimal clustering, determined by k-means, returned 4 categories (see

88

Methods, Fig. S1), grouping together partitions 1 and 2 as well as 4 and 5. These

89

findings indicate that an alternative tree with a comparable likelihood but a dramatically

90

different coarse-grain topology, most likely, cannot be constructed from this MSA.

91
92

Each of the 6 partitions can be characterized by a specific non-synonymous substitution

93

signature (Figs. 1C, S2), generally, corresponding to the most prominent non-

94

synonymous substitutions across the tree (Table S1), some of which are shared by two

95

or more partitions and appear independently many times, consistent with other

96

reports(22). The well known D614G substitution in the spike protein is part of these

97

signatures, and so are substitutions in two adjacent sites in the nucleocapsid protein

98

(see below). The rest of the signature sites are in the nonstructural proteins 1ab, 3a,

99

and 8 (Fig. 1C). The identification of these prevailing non-synonymous substitutions and

100

an additional set of frequent synonymous substitutions suggested that certain sites in

101

the SARS-CoV-2 genome might be evolving under positive selection. However,

102

uncovering the selective pressures affecting virus evolution was complicated by non-

103

negligible mutational biases. The distributions of the numbers of both synonymous and

104

non-synonymous substitutions across the genome were found to be substantially

105

overdispersed compared to both the Poisson and normal expectations (Fig. S3).

106

Examination of the relative frequencies of all 12 possible nucleotide substitutions

107

indicated a significant genome-wide excess of C to U mutations, approximately 3 fold

108

higher than any other nucleotide substitution, with the exception of G to U, as well as

109

some region-specific trends(Fig. S4).

110
111

Motivated by this observation, we compared the trinucleotide contexts of synonymous

112

and non-synonymous substitutions as well as the contexts of low and high frequency

113

substitutions. The context of high-frequency events, both synonymous and non-

114

synonymous, was found to be dramatically different from the background frequencies.

115

The NCN context (that is, all C->D mutations) harbors substantially more events than

116

other contexts (all 16 NCN triplets are within the top 20 most high-frequency-biased

117

ones, see Methods and Fig. S5) and is enriched in mutations uniformly across the

118

genome including both synonymous and non-synonymous sites as well as low and high

119

frequency sites. This pattern suggests a mechanistic bias of the coronavirus RNA-

120

dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). Evidently, such a bias that increases the

121

likelihood of observing multiple, independent mutations in the NCN context complicates

122

the detection of selection pressures. However, whereas all the sites with an excess of

123

synonymous nucleotide substitutions are NCN and thus can be inferred to originate

124

from the mutational bias, this is not the case for non-synonymous substitutions,

125

suggesting that at least some of these are driven by other mechanisms. Thus, we

126

excluded all synonymous substitutions and the non-synonymous substitutions with the

5

127

NCN context from further consideration as candidate sites evolving under positive

128

selection.

129
130

Beyond this specific context, the presence of any hypervariable sites complicates the

131

computation of the dN/dS ratio, the gauge of protein-level selection(23), which requires

132

enumerating the number of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions within each

133

gene. Hypervariable sites bias this analysis, and therefore, we used two methods to

134

ensure reliable estimation of dN/dS. For each protein-coding gene of SARS-CoV-2

135

(splitting the long orf1ab into 15 constituent non-structural proteins), we obtained both a

136

maximum likelihood estimate of dN/dS across 10 sub-alignments and an approximation

137

computed from the global ancestral reconstruction (see Methods). This approach was

138

required due to the size of the alignment, over which a global maximum likelihood

139

estimation would be computationally prohibitive. Despite considerable variability among

140

the genes, we obtained estimates of substantial purifying selection (0.1<dN/dS<0.5)

141

across the majority of the genome(Fig. S6), with a reasonable agreement between the

142

two methods. This estimate is compatible with previous demonstrations of purifying

143

selection among diverse RNA viruses(3) affecting about 50% of the sites surveyed or

144

more(2).

145
146

Thus, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be primarily driven by substantial

147

purifying selection. However, a small ensemble of non-synonymous substitutions

148

appeared to have emerged multiple times, independently, and were not subject to an

149

overt mechanistic bias. Due to the existence of many equally likely trees, in principle, in

150

one or more of such trees, any of these mutations could resolve to a single event.

151

However, such a resolution would be at the cost of inducing multiple parallel

152

substitutions for other mutations, and thus, we conclude that more than 100 codons in

153

the genome have undergone multiple parallel mutations in the course of SARS-CoV-2

154

evolution.

155
156

One immediate explanation of this observation is that these sites evolve under positive

157

selection. The possible alternatives could be that these sites are mutational hotspots or

158

that the appearance of multiple parallel mutations was caused by numerous

159

recombination events (either real or artifacts caused by incorrect genome assembly

160

from mixed infections) in the respective genomic regions. Contrary to what one would

161

expect under the hotspot scenario, we found that codons harboring many synonymous

162

substitutions tend to harbor few non-synonymous substitutions, and vice versa (Fig. S7

163

A). Although when a moving average with increasing window size was computed, this

164

relationship reversed (Fig. S7 B&C), the correlation between synonymous and non-

165

synonymous substitutions was weak. Most sites in the virus genome are highly

166

conserved, those sites that harbor the highest number of mutations tend to reside in

167

conserved neighborhoods, and the local fraction of sites that harbor at least one

168

mutation strongly correlates with the moving average (Fig. S8). Thus, whereas our

169

observations indicate that SARS-CoV-2 genomes are subject to diverse site-specific

170

and regional selection pressures, we did not detect regions of substantially elevated

171

mutation or recombination.

172
173

Given the widespread purifying selection, substantially relaxed selection at any site is

174

expected to permit multiple, parallel non-synonymous mutations to the same degree

175

that any site harbors multiple, parallel synonymous mutations. Thus, seeking to identify

176

sites subject to positive selection, we focused only on those non-synonymous

177

substitutions that independently occurred more frequently than 95% of all synonymous

178

substitutions excluding the mutagenic NCN context (see Methods). Most if not all sites

179

in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that we found to harbor such frequent, parallel non-

180

synonymous substitutions not subject to the restrictions discussed above are likely to

181

evolve under positive selection(Fig. 1D, Table S2).

182
183

Having identified the set of potential positively selected residues, we examined the tree

184

for evidence of epistasis(24) (see Methods) among these sites and revealed a network

185

of co-occurring substitutions suggestive of epistatic interactions (Fig. 1E, Table S3).

186

Strikingly, both D614G in the spike (S) protein and two adjacent substitutions in the

187

nucleocapsid (N) protein, R203K and G204R, are associated with exceptionally many

188

interactions, forming the two main hubs of the network. Spike D614G appears to boost

189

the infectivity of the virus, possibly, by increasing the binding affinity between the spike

190

protein and the cell surface receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 (25). The non-synonymous

191

mutations S|L54H,Q677H, A879S, and V1176F that are strongly linked to D614G in the

192

network are in the spike protein itself although examination of the spike structure does

193

not reveal direct physical interactions among these residues (Fig. S9). Another

194

substitution, S|H49Y, with a weaker statistical association to S|D614G, involves a site

195

that is close to 614 in the structure (Fig. S9). Conceivably, by increasing the receptor

196

affinity, the D614G substitution in the spike protein opens up new adaptive routes for

197

later steps in the viral lifecycle, but the specific mechanisms remain to be investigated

198

experimentally.

199
200

Of further interest were four substitutions within the spike protein that have been

201

observed in mink populations: H69del/V70del, Y453F, I692V and M1229I(26-27). I692V

202

never occurred within our tree, and this codon harbors many synonymous substitutions

203

atc(I) to att(I), suggestive of a mutational hotspot. In contrast, 69-, 70-, 453F, and 1229I

204

all appeared multiple times independently throughout the tree. These substitutions were

205

widely spread over the tree although all occurred close to tree tips and none passed our

206

criteria for positive selection. Two sites within the receptor-binding domain (RBD), N331

207

and N343, have been shown to be important for the maintenance of infectivity(28). As

208

could be expected, these amino acid residues are invariant. Four more substitutions in

209

the RBD, among others, N234Q, L452R, A475V, and V483A, have been demonstrated

210

to confer antibody resistance(28). We found N234 to be invariant, whereas a few L452R

211

and A475V mutations close to tree tips were detected as well as two independent

212

V483A mutations at the base of slightly larger clades within partition 1. None of these

213

sites passed our criteria for positive selection.

214
215

The two adjacent amino acid replacements in the N protein, R(agg)203K(aaa) and

216

G(gga)204R(cga), appear together 9 times. Both sites are likely to evolve under positive

217

selection and are adjacent to a third such site, S(agt)202N(aat). The replacements

218

R(agg)203K(aaa) and G(gga)204R(cga) occur via three adjacent nucleotide

219

substitutions which strongly suggests a single mutational event. Evolution of beta8

220

coronaviruses with high case fatality rates including SARS-CoV-2 was accompanied by

221

accumulation of positive charges in the N protein that are thought to enhance its

222

transport to the nucleus(29). Although positions 202-204 are outside the known nuclear

223

localization signals, the substitutions in these positions are statistically associated with

224

the Q229H substitution in the N protein which occurs in a site known to be responsible

225

for nuclear shuttling (30). Furthermore, the rapid rise of the A220V substitution in the N

226

protein (excluded from considered as a candidate for positive selection in our analysis

227

due to its NCN context) in a European cohort during the summer of 2020 might be

228

related to a transmission advantage of the variant harboring this substitution(31).

229

Conceivably, the substitutions in these two adjacent sites, in particular

230

G(gga)204R(cga), which increases the positive charge, might contribute to the nuclear

231

localization of the N protein as well. This highly unusual cluster of three putative

232

positively selected amino acid substitutions in the N protein is a strong candidate for

233

experimental study that could illuminate the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity.

234
235

Orf3a|Q57H is a third hub in the network and, although not considered a candidate for

236

positive selection in our analysis due to its NCN context, ORF8 S84L is a hub in the

237

larger epistatic network including all strongly associated residues (Fig. S10). Also of

238

interest in this larger network is S|N439K that is linked to S|D614G and, despite its NCN

239

context, is potentially subject to positive selection having been demonstrated to enable

240

immune escape(32).

241
242

In addition to the recurrent missense mutations that are likely to evolve under positive

243

selection, we identified numerous nonsense mutations (Table S4), the most frequent

244

one, orf8|18(UAA), appearing in 66 unique genome sequences. These nonsense

245

substitutions, apparently, resulting in truncated proteins, occur almost exclusively within

246

the minor SARS-CoV-2 ORFs. ORF8 has been implicated in the modulation of host

247

immunity by SARS-CoV-2, so these truncations might play a role in immune

248

evasion(33-34).

250

Epistasis in RNA virus evolution, as demonstrated for influenza, can constrain the

251

evolutionary landscape as well as promote compensatory variation in coupled sites,

252

providing an adaptive advantage which would otherwise confer a prohibitive fitness

253

cost(35). Because even sites subject to purifying selection(36) can play an adaptive role

254

through interactions with other residues in the epistatic network, the network presented

255

here (Fig. 1E) likely underrepresents the extent of epistatic interactions occurring during

256

SARS-CoV-2 evolution. The early evolutionary events that shaped the epistatic network

257

conceivably laid the foundation for the diversification of the virus relevant to virulence,

258

immune evasion, and transmission. Recent analysis of within-patient genetic diversity

259

has shown that the most common mutations are highly diverse within individuals(37).

260

Such diversity could either result from multiple infections, or otherwise, could present

261

evidence of an even greater role of positive selection affecting a larger number of sites

262

than inferred from our tree (Fig. 1D). Similarly to the case of Influenza, positive selection

263

on these sites could drive virus diversification and might support a regular pattern of

264

repeat epidemics with grave implications for public health. An analysis of the

265

relationships between the sequencing date and location of each isolate and its position

266

within the tree can determine whether diversification is already apparent within the

267

evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2.

268
269

We first demonstrated a strong correlation between the sequencing date of SARS-CoV-

270

2 genomes and the distance to the tree root (Fig. S11), indicating a sufficiently low level

271

of noise in the data for subsequent analyses. Although examination of the global

272

distribution of each of the 6 major SARS-CoV-2 partitions (Figs. S12-13) indicates

273

considerable regional diversification, this variation could partly result from time-

274

dependent fluctuations (Fig. 2). The beginning of the pandemic is primarily

275

characterized by the global extinction of partitions 1 and 2 which were dominant initially,

276

through the beginning of February, in all four regions encompassing the vast majority of

277

the available sequences (United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia/New Zealand).

278

Notably, partitions 1 and 2 lack the substitution S|D614G which is the consensus for all

279

other partitions.

281

The four “late” partitions began rising to prominence thereafter, with different regional

282

trends. A common global trend is the increasing prevalence of partition 6, the only one

283

in which the adjacent substitutions N|R203K and G204R belong to the consensus. From

284

April to August, partition 6 grew in prominence in all four regions, the only partition to do

285

so (Figs. 2 and 3A, S14). This trend is most dramatic in Australia/New Zealand where

286

all other partitions apparently went extinct by the beginning of June. Notably, most

287

sequences from this region form a clade offset by a long branch within partition 6

288

(mutational signature shown in Fig. S15 notably including S|S477N). Although the rise

289

of partition 6 in the US has been slow and unsteady, perhaps, the starkest contrast to

290

the global ascension of partition 6 is the resurgence of partition 3 within Europe.

291

Partition 3 seems to be poised to again become dominant in Europe after partition 6 had

292

risen to greater than 80% frequency in July. In this case, as in the case of partition 6 in

293

Australia/New Zealand, clustering of sequences offset by a long branch within partition

294

3 is observed. The non-synonymous substitution signature of this clade (Fig. S16)

295

includes N|A220V such that nearly all European isolates belong to partition 6 and

296

harbor N|R203K&G204R or belong to partition 3 and harbor N|A220V by the beginning

297

of September. Motivated by this finding, we examined the mutational signature

298

characterizing isolates collected after July 17 from the US, the region with the lowest

fraction of partition 6 isolates, compared with those collected after July 17 from the

300

remaining three regions (Fig. S17). Focusing only on substitutions in the N protein (Fig.

301

S18), three additional mutations in the vicinity of motifs implicated in nuclear

302

localization, N|P199L,S194L,T205I, were identified to be prevalent within the US (Fig.

303

S19). Although only few isolates from Asia after late August are available within this

304

dataset, the rapid decrease in partition 6 frequency corresponds to a rapid increase in

305

N|S194L within the region. Taken together, isolates with at least 1 of these 5 mutations

306

compose the majority in all regions by the beginning of August (Fig. 2E), strongly

307

suggesting that this region of the N protein plays a prominent role in the adaptation of

308

SARS-CoV-2 to human hosts.

309
310

Despite these global trends, regional dynamics make it difficult to assess whether

311

partition 6 or, perhaps, a distinct clade within partition 3 are indeed more fit than the

312

other “late” partitions and whether SARS-CoV-2 is beginning to regionally diversify. To

313

better assess the extent of regional divergence, we constructed two diversity measures,

314

one partition-dependent and the other, partition-independent. First, we considered 3

315

groups of virus genomes: partitions 1&2 (without the consensus substitution S|D614G),

316

partitions 3,4,5, and partition 6 (with consensus substitutions N|R203K&G204R), and

317

computed the Hellinger distance of this three-group frequency distribution between all

318

pairs of regions over a sliding window as a function of time (Fig. 3B). Next, we sampled

319

pairs of isolates both within and between regions, computed the mean tree-distance

320

between pairs over the same sliding window (Figs. 3C, S16), and examined the ratio of

321

inter-regional and intra-regional tree-distances (see Methods).

322
323

Both measures reveal three principal stages of the pandemic. 1) The beginning of the

324

year, through early February, when partitions 1 and 2 were dominant, was marked by

325

regional diversification. 2) The extinction of the two “early” partitions signaled

326

globalization and the spread of the mutation S|D614G from February through the end of

327

May. By June, Australia/New Zealand began diverging from the rest of the globe and

328

the remaining regions began to modestly diverge from one another as well. These

329

trends are superimposed over steady, substantial intra-regional diversification (Fig.

330

S16).

331
332

Such diversification of the virus could potentially pose problems for both testing and

333

vaccine development. Substitutions in the E protein have already been demonstrated to

334

interfere with a common PCR assay(38). Generally, ORF1ab is more conserved than

335

the spike protein, which itself is more conserved than the remaining ORFs (Figs. S3-4).

336

Using our SARS-CoV-2 MSA, we surveyed 10 regions from ORF1ab(5), N(4), and E(1)

337

genes that are commonly used within PCR assays (39) for substitutions relative to the

338

reference sequence. Among the nearly 40,000 genome sequences, there were

339

hundreds to thousands of nucleotide substitutions in each of these regions but those in

340

ORF1ab were markedly less variable than those in N (Supplementary table 5) with one

341

region in N demonstrating variability in nearly half of all isolates. It can be expected that

342

most targets within the polyprotein will remain subject to the fewest polymorphism-

343

induced false negatives even as the virus continues to diversify.

344
345

Of the 9 vaccine candidates currently in phase 3 trials(40), three are inactivated whole-

346

virus (Sinovac, Wuhan Institute of Biological Products/Sinopharm, Beijing Institute of

347

Biological Products/Sinopharm); five utilize the entire spike protein as the antigen

348

(Moderna/NIAID, CanSino Biological Inc./Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, University of

349

Oxford/AstraZeneca, Gamaleya Research Institute, Janssen Pharmaceutical

350

Companies) and one utilizes only the RBD (Pfizer/Fosun Pharma/BioNTech). In addition

351

to the greater sequence conservation of the spike protein relative to all other ORFs

352

outside of the polyprotein, it is the principal host-interacting protein of SARS-CoV-2,

353

making both the whole protein and the RBD obvious antigenic candidates. Most

354

mutations in the RBD were demonstrated to decrease infectivity; however, some

355

conferred resistance to neutralizing antibodies(27). We only identified one mutation in

356

the RBD that was both observed in greater than 1% of the tree branches and passed

357

our criteria for positive selection, S|S477N. Should such mutations become more

358

prominent, the RBD might prove a less effective antigen than the whole spike protein.

359
360

To summarize, from these findings, it is clear that, despite dramatically reduced

361

travel(41), the evolution of SARS-Cov-2 is at least partly shaped by globalizing factors,

362

such as the increased virus fitness conferred by S|D614G, N|R203K&G204R, and other

363

positively selected substitutions. There is no strong evidence of “speciation”, that is,

364

formation of stable, diverging variants, a finding that bodes well for a successful

365

vaccination campaign in the midterm. Nevertheless, it is equally clear that SARS-CoV-2

366

has the capacity to diversify, posing a risk of virus escape from immunity and hence

367

repeat epidemics.

Multiple alignment of SARS-CoV-2 genomes

512
513

515
516
517

All available SARS-CoV-2 genomes as of October 11, 2020 were retrieved from the
Genbank(10), Gisaid(11), and CNCB(12) datasets. Sequences with apparent anomalies
(sequence inversion etc.) were immediately discarded. Sequences were harmonized to
DNA (e.g. U was transformed to T to amend software compatibility) and clustered
according to 100% identity with no coverage threshold using CD-HIT(42-43), with
ambiguous characters masking. All characters excepting ACGT were considered
ambiguous. The least ambiguous sequence from each cluster was selected and
sequences shorter than 25120 nucleotides were discarded.

518
519
520
521
522
523
524
525

Exterior ambiguous characters (preceding/succeeding the first/last defined nucleotide)
were removed and sequences with more than 10 remaining, interior, ambiguous
characters were discarded. The remaining sequences were aligned using multithreaded MAFFT(44) with 220 cores (--thread 220) and 3.8Tb of RAM to maintain
usage of the normal DP algorithm (44) (--nomemsave). Sequences sourced from nonhuman hosts were manually identified from the metadata and those excluded at the
previous step were added to the alignment using MAFFT, maintaining the number of
columns in the original alignment (specifying --keeplength), again on 220 cores.

526
527
528
529
530

Sites corresponding to protein-coding open reading frames were then mapped to the
alignment from the reference sequence NC_045512.2 excluding stop codons as follows:
266-13468+13468-21552, orf1ab; 21563-25381, S; 25393-26217, orf3a; 26245-26469,
E; 26523-27188, M; 27202-27384, orf6; 27394-27756, orf7a; 27756-27884, orf7b;
27894-28256, orf8; and 28274-29530, N. The remaining sites were discarded.

531
532
533
534
535
536

The resulting alignment contained out-of-frame gaps. Gaps in the reference sequence
were found to correspond to gaps in all but fewer than 1% of the remaining sequences.
These sites were discarded. The remaining gaps shorter than three nucleotides were
replaced with the ambiguous character, N. Longer gaps were shifted into frame and
padded with ambiguous characters on either end of the gap, minimizing the number of
sites altered.

A fast, approximate tree was then built using FastTree(45) (parameters: -nt -gtr -gamma
-nosupport -fastest) to unambiguously define two clusters of sequences: an outgroup
consisting of 14 sequences sourced from non-human hosts prior to 2020 and the main
group. The tree construction requires the resolution of very short branch lengths which
makes it necessary to compile FastTree at double precision. Outliers from the remaining
sequences were then identified based on the Hamming distance (excluding gaps and
ambiguous characters) to the nearest neighbor, the Hamming distance to the
consensus, and the degree to which those substitutions relative to consensus were
clustered in the genome. At this step, 21 sequences were removed.

550
551

555

The resulting alignment, consisting of 39,695 sequences and 29,119 sites, was
maintained for the construction of the global tree and ancestral sequence
reconstruction. In an effort to minimize the impact of sequencing error on the tree
topology, as well as to decrease computational costs, a reduced alignment was then
constructed through the removal of 1) invariant sites, 2) sites invariant with the
exception of a single sequence, and 3) sites invariant throughout the main group with
the exception of at most one sequence representing each minority nucleotide.
Removing these sites created substantial redundancy, so a representative sequence
was selected for each cluster of 100% identity to yield an alignment consisting of 34,685
sequences and 10,131 sites.

We sought to optimize tree topology with IQ-TREE(46); however, we found building the
global tree to be computationally prohibitive, and thus, we proceeded to subsample the
main group alignment as follows. First, a core set of maximally diverse sequences is
selected. The set is initialized with a pair of sequences: a sequence maximizing the
number of substitutions relative to consensus and a paired sequence which maximizes
the Hamming distance to itself. Sequences are then added to this core set one at a time
maximizing the minimum Hamming distance to any representative of the set until N
sequences are incorporated. Next, 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐�𝐿𝐿/(𝑀𝑀 − 𝑁𝑁)� resulting sets are initialized with this
core set where M is the target number of sequences and L is the total number of
sequences in the alignment (34,685). Then, sequences that have not yet been
incorporated into any resulting set are added to each resulting set, again one at a time,
maximizing the minimum distance to any representative of the set until M sequences
are incorporated. The order of the resulting sets is randomized at each iteration without
repeats. Once every (main group) sequence has been incorporated into at least one
resulting set, sequences are randomly incorporated into each set until every set
contains M sequences. Finally, the outgroup is added to each resulting set. We chose
M=3,000 in an effort to optimize computational efficiency and N=300. Note that while
increasing N increases the number of sets required for alignment coverage, and thus
compute time, insufficient overlap between the sequences assigned each sub-alignment

greatly affects the results of subsequent steps. We found N=100 to be too low to
effectively constrain the global tree for this dataset.

579
580
581
582
583

A tree was then built, using IQ-TREE, for each resulting set, with the evolutionary model
fixed to GTR+F+G4 and the minimum branch length decreased from the default 10e-6
to 10e-7, according to the results of previous parameter studies(14). These trees were
then converted into constraint files and merged to generate a single global constraint file
for use within FastTree (parameters: -nt -gtr -gamma -cat 4 -nosupport -constraints).

584
585
586
587

The remaining sequences excluded from this tree were then reintroduced as unresolved
multifurcations and a new constraint file from the multifurcated tree was constructed. A
second iteration of FastTree was initiated on the whole alignment including all sites to
produce the final tree. This tree was rooted at the outgroup.

Reconstruction of Ancestral Genome Sequences

Ancestral states were estimated by Fitch Traceback(15). Briefly, character sets were
constructed from leaf to root where each node was assigned the intersection of the
descendant character sets if not empty and the union otherwise. Then, moving from root
to leaf, nodes with more than one character in their set were assigned the consensus
character if present in their set or a randomly chosen representative character
otherwise. Substitutions between states were identified and placed in the middle of the
branch bridging the pair of nodes.

Statistical associations between mutations were computed in a manner similar to that
previously described(24). Briefly, sequences were leaf-weighted based on the branch
lengths of the ultrameterized, tree. Every mutation present across the tree at 50 mean
leaf-weight equivalents or more was considered. The probability of independent cooccurrence between any pair was estimated in two ways. An arbitrary member of the
pair was selected as the ancestral mutation, and the binomial probability:

was computed where N_total is the number of substitutions to the descendant mutation
across the entire ancestral record, N_pair is the number of substitutions to the
descendant which succeed or appear simultaneously with a substitution to the ancestral
mutation, and F is the fraction of the tree (fraction of all applicable branch lengths)
occupied by the ancestral mutation. The ancestral/descendent designation was then
reversed and the “binomial score” was constructed as the negative log of the product of
these two terms. Additionally, for each pair, the observed and expected (product of the

the log-odds ratio) was calculated:

where PCDF(exp,obs) is the cumulative probability of a Poisson distribution with mean
“exp”, the expected value of the data, and evaluated at “obs”, the observed value of the
data. Both scores are reported. Fig. 1E and Table S3 display putative positively
selected mutations with both scores above 5 or at least two simultaneous substitutions.
Fig. S10 has a relaxed score threshold for 2, an increased weight threshold of 100, and
is not restricted to positively selected residues.

Pairwise Hamming distances were computed for all pairs of rows in the global MSA
ignoring gaps and ambiguous characters i.e. the sequences X=”ATN-A” and
Y=”NTAAT” would be assigned a distance of 1. The resulting distance matrix was
embedded in three dimensions with the MATLAB(47) routine “cmdscale”. 100 rounds of
stochastically initiated k-means clustering of the embedding was conducted and the
optimum cluster number was determined to be 4 on the basis of the silhouette score
distribution (Fig S1).

Mutations were divided into four categories: synonymous vs non-synonymous
substitutions and high vs low frequency of independent occurrence. For example,
consider codon X with 3 non-synonymous substitutions gat->ggt and 1 non-synonymous
substitution gat->cgt. In this context, a non-synonymous nucleotide substitution a->g of
frequency 4 would be recorded in nucleotide (X-1)*3+2. The low vs high frequency
threshold was determined by the 95th percentile of the synonymous mutation frequency
distribution (operationally. 5). For each mutation, the trinucleotide contexts from the
ancestral reconstruction at the nodes where the mutation occurred were compared to
the background genome-wide frequencies, computed for the inferred common ancestor
of SARS-CoV-2.

The expected frequencies of the trinucleotides using the background distribution were
tabulated; the Yates correction (+/-0.5 to the original count depending on whether the
count is below or above the expectation) was applied to the observed frequencies; the
log-odds ratios of the (corrected) observed frequencies to the expectation were
computed; and CMDS was applied to the Euclidean distances between the log-odds

vectors to embed the points onto a plane (Fig. S5 A.). This analysis was then repeated,
this time, distinguishing only between high and low frequency substitutions but not N
and S (Fig. S5 B). Finally, the differences in the contexts of high frequency synonymous
vs non-synonymous events were considered in the same manner and the chi-square
statistics ((observed-expected)^2/expected) were compared with the critical chi-square
value (p=0.05/64, df=1, Fig. S5 C.).

For each of the 24 ORFs (splitting orf1ab into 15 segments corresponding to the 15
mature proteins, nsp11 and nsp12 combined), 10 reduced alignments were constructed
as follows. Sequences were ordered based on diversity, in the same order with which
they were included in the constraint trees. The first 10 sequences are conserved across
every alignment and the remaining 40 are unique to each alignment. The reference
sequence, NC_045512.2, was additionally added to each reduced alignment. PAML(48)
was then used to estimate tN, tS, dN/dS, N, S, and N/S for each segment and every
reduced alignment.

Given the global ancestral reconstruction from Fitch traceback, the total number of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions (nN and nS, respectively) as well as these
tallies normalized by the respective segment length (tN, and tS, respectively) were
retrieved for each segment. . A hybrid dN/dS value for each segment was estimated to
be (nN/nS)/(N/S)* where (N/S)* is the median value of N/S across all repeats for the
segment.

Headers for all isolates belonging to CD-HIT clusters with a representative incorporated

extract the sequencing date and location. Sequencing location abbreviations were
matched to full names and the latitude/longitude of a representative city for each
location was retrieved from simplemaps (https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities)(49).

Two approaches, one partition dependent and one partition independent, were used.
First three groups of isolates were constructed belonging to partitions 1&2, partitions
3,4,&5, and partition 6. The Hellinger distance between regions over a sliding time
window was then computed between regions for this three group distribution. Next, 400
isolates were randomly selected from each region over a sliding window and 200 pairs
within each region as well as 200 pairs between each pair of regions were composed.

NCN context (i.e. all mutations C->D) harbors dramatically more mutation events than
the other contexts (all 16 NCN events are within the top 20 most-biased high-frequency
events). The log-odds ratios for low-frequency events are somewhat correlated with
those for high-frequency events (rPearson=0.5, without NCN rPearson=0.64),
suggesting the same mechanism may be responsible for the strong bias observed
among high frequency events and the weaker bias observed among low frequency
events. C. Log odds ratio of high frequency nonsynonymous mutations relative to the
background expectation from the sum of both high synonymous and high
nonsynonymous mutations vs. the sum + 1. There are 12 contexts where synonymous
and non-synonymous events differ significantly. All contexts with an excess of
synonymous events are NCN, suggesting that high-frequency synonymous events
could be driven by mechanistic bias; on the contrary, none of the contexts with an
excess of non-synonymous mutations are NCN (in fact all are NGN:
aga,agt,agg,ggt,agc,tgt,gct vs. aca,tct,tca,tcg,ccg), suggesting that these nonsynonymous events could be driven by other mechanisms. There is no correlation
between the frequency of event context and the log-odds ratio for non-synonymous
events, further suggesting that the log-odds ratio is not biased by hot-spot mutation
context.
