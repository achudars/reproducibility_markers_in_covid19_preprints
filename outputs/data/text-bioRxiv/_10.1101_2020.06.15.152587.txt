Abstract

37

Emergence of the novel pathogenic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and its rapid pandemic

38

spread presents numerous questions and challenges that demand immediate attention. Among

39

these is the urgent need for a better understanding of humoral immune response against the

40

virus as a basis for developing public health strategies to control viral spread. For this, sensitive,

41

specific and quantitative serological assays are required. Here we describe the development of

42

a semi-quantitative high-content microscopy-based assay for detection of three major classes

43

(IgG, IgA and IgM) of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in human samples. The possibility to

44

detect antibodies against the entire viral proteome together with a robust semi-automated image

45

analysis workflow resulted in specific, sensitive and unbiased assay which complements the

46

portfolio of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays. The procedure described here has been used for

47

clinical studies and provides a general framework for the application of quantitative high-

48

throughput microscopy to rapidly develop serological assays for emerging virus infections.

1. Introduction
The recent emergence of the novel pathogenic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2

[1–3]

and the

56

rapid pandemic spread of the virus has dramatic consequences in all affected countries. In the

57

absence of a protective vaccine or a causative antiviral therapy for COVID-19 patients, testing

58

for SARS-CoV-2 infection and tracking of transmission and outbreak events are of paramount

59

importance to control viral spread and avoid the overload of healthcare systems. The sequence

60

of the viral genome became publicly available only weeks after the initial reports on COVID-19

SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels becomes highly important. Many critical aspects of the

70

humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 are currently not well understood [8]. In addition,

71

levels of infection in the general population in different areas remain largely unknown due to

72

proportion of undocumented cases arising from asymptomatic individuals

73

been subjected to RNA testing, or to limitations in testing capacity especially in areas of relatively

74

high prevalence. Public health control strategies aiming at regulating human mobility and social

75

behaviour in order to suppress the infection rate will have to take into account the proportion of

76

seropositive individuals in the general population, or in specific population groups [11]. Information

77

on the level of antiviral antibodies, as well as on the serological response against different viral

78

proteins, is also a key element of understanding the nature, development and durability of the

79

antiviral immune response. Therefore, specific, sensitive and reliable methods for the

80

quantitative detection of virus specific antibodies in human specimens are urgently needed from

81

the beginning of an emerging pandemic.

Compared to approaches for direct virus diagnostics by PCR, development of test

83

systems for detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies proved to be more challenging. In

84

particular, cross reactivity of antibodies against circulating common cold coronaviruses (strains

85

OC43, NL63, 229E and HKU1) are of concern in this respect as it was observed in case of

86

serological tests developed for closely related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [12]. Developments in

89

initially marketed test kits underwent a very rapid development and approval process due to the

emergency of the situation, with low numbers of samples used for validation; consequently,

91

sensitivity and specificity of the test systems often failed to meet the practical requirements

witnessed in the early phases of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Thus, complementary

95

strategies to test for antiviral antibodies that can be rapidly deployed in situations where

96

commercially available kits are either not yet developed or not available are an important addition

97

to the diagnostic toolkit.

98

Immunofluorescence (IF) using virus infected cells as a specimen is a classical

99

serological approach in virus diagnostics and has been applied to coronavirus infections,

100

including the closely related virus SARS-CoV [14–16]. The advantages of IF are (i) that it does not

101

depend on specific diagnostic reagent kits or instruments, (ii) that the specimen contains all viral

102

antigens expressed in the cellular context and (iii) that the method has the potential to provide

103

high information content (differentiation of staining patterns and intensities due to reactivity

104

against various viral proteins). A mayor disadvantage of the IF approach as it is typically used in

105

serological testing is its limited throughput capacity due to the involvement of manual microscopy

106

handling steps and sample evaluation based on visual inspection of micrographs. Furthermore,

107

visual classification is subjective and thus not well standardized and yields only binary results.

108

Here, we address those limitations, making use of advanced automated microscopy and image

109

analysis strategies developed for basic research. We present the establishment and validation

110

of a semi-quantitative, semi-automated workflow for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody detection.

111

With its 96-well format, semi-automated microscopy and automated image analysis workflow it

112

combines advantages of IF with a reliable and objective semi-quantitative readout and high

113

throughput compatibility. The protocol described here was developed in response to the

114

emergence of SARS-CoV-2, but it represents a general approach that can be adapted for the

115

study of other viral infections and is suitable for rapid deployment to support diagnostics of

116

emerging viral infections in the future.

117

2. Results

118

2.1 Setup of the IF assay for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection

119

We decided to use cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 as samples for our IF analyses,

120

since this setup provides the best chance for detection of antibodies targeted at the different

121

viral proteins expressed in the host cell context. African green monkey kidney epithelial cells

122

(VeroE6 cell line) have been used for infection with SARS-CoV-2, virus production and IF[3,17].

123

In preparation for our analyses we compared different cell lines for use in infection and IF

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.152587; this version posted October 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

124

experiments, but all tested cell lines were found to be inferior to VeroE6 cells for our purposes

125

(see Materials and Methods and Fig. S1). All following experiments were thus carried out using

126

the VeroE6 cell line.

127

In order to allow for clear identification of positive reactivity in spite of a variable and

128

sometimes high nonspecific background from human sera, our strategy involves a direct

129

comparison of the IF signal from infected and non-infected cells in the same sample. Preferential

130

antibody binding to infected compared to non-infected cells indicates the presence of specific

131

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the examined serum. Under our conditions, infection rates of ~40-

132

80% of the cell population were achieved, allowing for a comparison of infected and non-infected

133

cells in the same well of the test plate. An antibody that detects dsRNA produced during viral

134

replication was used to distinguish infected from non-infected cells within the same field of view

135

(Fig. 1A).

136

In order to define the conditions for immunostaining using human serum, we selected a

137

small panel of negative and positive control sera. Four sera from healthy donors collected before

138

November 2019 were chosen as negative controls, and eight sera from PCR confirmed COVID-

139

19 inpatients collected at day 14 or later post symptom onset were employed as positive controls.

140

Sera from this test cohort were used for primary staining, and bound antibodies were detected

141

using fluorophore-coupled secondary antibodies against human IgG, IgA or IgM.

142

No difference between infected and non-infected cells in serum IgG antibody binding was

143

observed when sera collected before the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were examined

144

(Fig. 1B, Fig. S2). In contrast, COVID-19 patient sera were clearly characterized by higher serum

145

IgG antibody binding to infected compared to non-infected cells (Fig. 1B). All eight COVID-19

146

patient serum samples yielded higher IgG binding to infected compared to non-infected cells as

147

assessed by visual inspection (Fig. S2). Similar results were obtained when an IgA or IgM

148

specific secondary antibody was used for detection (Fig. S3). In order to allow for the parallel

149

assessment of IgG and IgA or IgM antibodies, we established conditions for the parallel detection

150

of anti-IgG coupled to AlexaFluor488 and anti-IgA or anti-IgM coupled to DyLight650 or

151

AlexaFluor647 secondary antibodies, respectively, without signal bleedthrough. Using this

152

approach, it was possible to implement detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA or IgM

153

antibodies in a single experimental setup (Fig. S4).

154

Titration experiments were performed with positive control sera to determine the optimal

155

range of serum concentration in the IF experiments. All eight positive control samples showed

156

visually detectable specific labelling of infected cells over the range of 1:102 and 1:105,

157

demonstrating robustness of the assay (Fig. S5). Serum concentrations of less than 1:105 did

158

not yield detectable signals in all cases. We decided to employ a dilution of 1:102 in the further

159

experiments

160

2.2 Image analysis

161

Our next aim was to establish a semi-automated analysis workflow for image acquisition and

162

analysis for a medium to high throughput setting. VeroE6 cells were seeded into 96-well plates

163

infected and immunostained using anti-dsRNA antibody and patient serum, followed by indirect

164

detection using a mixture of anti-IgG and anti-IgA/IgM secondary antibodies. Images were

165

acquired using an automated widefield microscope (see Materials and Methods section for more

166

detail).

167

To obtain a measure for specific antibody binding we performed automated

168

segmentation of cells and classified them into infected and non-infected cells based on the

169

dsRNA staining. We then measured fluorescence intensities in the serum channel per cell as a

170

proxy for the amount of bound antibodies for both infected and non-infected cells and calculated

171

the ratio between these values for infected and non-infected cells in a given specimen. To enable

172

training of a machine learning approach for cell segmentation and to directly evaluate infected

173

cell classification, we manually labelled cells and annotated them as infected/non-infected in 10

174

images chosen from 5 positive and 5 control specimens. Fig. 2 presents a graphical overview of

175

all analysis steps; the full description of every step can be found in Materials and Methods.

176

Briefly, our approach works as follows:

177

First, we manually discarded all images that contained obvious artefacts such as large

178

dust particles or dirt and out-of-focus images. Then, images were processed to correct for the

179

uneven illumination profile in each channel. Next, we segmented individual cells with a seeded

180

watershed algorithm

[18]

, using nuclei segmented via StarDist
[20,21]

[19]

as seeds and boundary

181

predictions from a U-Net

as a heightmap. We evaluated this approach using leave-one-

182

image-out cross-validation on the manual annotations and measured an average precision[22] of

183

0.77 +- 0.08 (i.e., on average 77% of segmented cells are matched correctly to the

184

corresponding cell in the annotations). Combined with extensive automatic quality control which

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.152587; this version posted October 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

7
185

discards outliers in the results, the segmentation was found to be of sufficient quality for our

186

analysis, especially since robust intensity measurements were used to reduce the effect of

187

remaining errors.

188

We then classified the segmented cells into infected and non-infected, by measuring

189

the 95th percentile intensities in the dsRNA channel and classifying cells as infected if this value

190

exceeded 4.8 times the noise level, determined by the mean absolute deviation. This factor and

191

the percentile were determined empirically using grid search on the manually annotated images

192

(see above). Using leave-one-out cross validation on the image level, we found that this

193

approach yields an average F1-score of 84.3%.

194

In order to make our final measurement more reliable, we then discarded whole wells,

195

images or individual segmented cells based on quality control criteria that were determined by

196

inspection of initial results. Those criteria include a minimal number of non-infected cells per

197

well; minimal and maximal number of cells per image; minimal cell intensities for images; and

198

minimal and maximal sizes of individual cells (see Materials and Methods for full details).

199

To score each sample, we computed the intensity ratio 𝑟 :
𝑟=

𝑚𝐼
𝑚𝑁

Eq. 1

200

Here, 𝑚𝐼 is the median serum intensity of infected cells and 𝑚𝑁 the median serum intensity of

201

non-infected cells. For each cell, we compute its intensity by computing the mean pixel intensity

202

in the serum channel (excluding the nucleus area where we typically did not observe serum

203

binding) and then subtracting the background intensity, which is measured on two control wells

204

that did not contain any serum.

205

We used efficient implementations for all processing steps and deployed the analysis

206

software on a computer cluster in order to enhance the speed of imaging data processing. For

207

visual inspection, we have further developed an open-source software tool (PlateViewer) for

208

interactive visualization of high-throughput microscopy data [23]. PlateViewer was used in a final

209

quality control step to visually inspect positive hits. For example, PlateViewer inspection allowed

210

identifying a characteristic spotted pattern co-localizing with the dsRNA staining (Fig. S6) that

211

was sometimes observed in the IgA channel upon staining with negative control serum. In

212

contrast, sera from COVID-19 patients typically displayed cytosol, ER-like and plasma

213

membrane staining patterns in this channel (Fig. 1B, Fig. S3). The dsRNA co-localizing pattern

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.152587; this version posted October 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

8
214

observed for sera from the negative control cohort is by definition non-specific for SARS-CoV-2,

215

but would be classified as a positive hit based on staining intensity alone. Using PlateViewer,

216

we performed a quality control on all IgA positive hits and removed those displaying the spotted

217

pattern colocalising with the dsRNA signal from further analysis.

218

2.3 Assay characterization and validation

219

With the immunofluorescence protocol and automated image analysis in place we

220

proceeded to test a larger number of control samples in a high throughput compatible manner

221

for assay validation. All samples were processed for IF as described above, and in parallel

222

analysed by a commercially available semi-quantitative SARS-CoV-2 ELISA approved for

223

diagnostic use (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG

224

and IgA antibodies.

225

As outlined above, a main concern regarding serological assays for SARS-CoV-2

226

antibody detection is the occurrence of false positive results. A particular concern in this case is

227

cross-reactivity of antibodies that originated from infection with any of the four types of common

228

cold Corona viruses (ccCoV) circulating in the population. The highly immunogenic major

229

structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein, have an overall

230

homology of ~30% [3] to their counterparts in ccCoV and subdomains of these proteins display a

231

higher degree homology; cross-reactivity with ccCoV has been discussed as the major reason

232

for false positive detection in serological tests for closely related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [12].

233

Also, acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) may result in

234

unspecific reactivity of human sera

235

consisting of 218 sera collected before the fall of 2019, comprising samples from healthy donors

236

(n=105, cohort B), patients that tested positive for ccCoV several months before the blood

237

sample was taken (n=34, all four types of ccCoV represented; cohort A), as well as patients with

238

diagnosed Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n=22; cohort Z), EBV or CMV infection (n=57, cohort E).

239

We further selected a panel of 57 sera from 29 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients collected

240

at different days post symptom onset as a positive sample set (cohort C, see below).

[24,25]

. We therefore selected a negative control panel

241

Sera were employed as primary antisera for IF staining using IgM, IgA or IgG specific

242

secondary antibodies, and samples were imaged and analysed as described above. This

243

procedure yielded a ratiometric intensity score for each serum sample. Based on the scores

244

obtained for the negative control cohort and the patient sera, we defined the threshold separating

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.152587; this version posted October 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

245

negative from positive scores for each of the antibody channels. For this, we performed ROC

246

curve analysis

247

possible to take the relative importance of sensitivity versus specificity as well as seroprevalence

248

in the population (if known) into account for optimal threshold definition. By giving more weight

249

to false positive or false negative results, one can adjust the threshold dependent on the context

250

of the study. Whereas high sensitivity is of importance for e.g. monitoring seroconversion of a

251

patient known to be infected, high specificity is crucial for population based screening

252

approaches, where large study cohorts characterized by low seroprevalence are tested. Since

253

we envision the use of the assay for screening approaches, we decided to assign more weight

254

to specificity at the cost of sensitivity for our analyses (see Materials and Methods for an in-depth

255

description of the analysis). Optimal separation in this case was given using threshold values of

256

1.39, 1.31 and 1.27 for IgA, IgG and IgM channels respectively (Fig. S7). We validated the

257

classification performance on negative control cohort E (n=57) which was not seen during

258

threshold selection, and detected no positive scores. Results from the analysis of the negative

259

control sera are presented in Fig. 4 and Table 1.

[26–28]

on a subset of the data (cohorts A, B, C, Z). Using this approach, it is

260

While the majority of these samples tested negative in ELISA measurements as well

261

as in the IF analyses, some positive readings were obtained in each of the assays, in particular

262

in the IgA specific analyses (Fig. 4 and Table 1). Since samples from these cohorts were

263

collected between 2015 and 2019, and donors were therefore not exposed to SARS-CoV-2

264

before sampling, these readings represent false positives. Of note, negative control cohort E

265

displayed a particularly high rate of false positives in ELISA measurements, but not in IF (Table

266

1). We conclude that the threshold values determined achieve our goal of yielding highly specific

267

IF results (at the cost of sub-maximal sensitivity).

268

Roughly 10.6% (IgA) or 3% (IgG) of the samples were classified as positive or

269

potentially positive by ELISA (Table 1). The notably lower specificity of the IgA determination in

270

a seronegative cohort observed here is in accordance with findings in other studies

271

information provided by the manufacturer of the test (90,5% for IgA vs. 99,3% for IgG;

272

Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 data sheet, April 24, 2020; in response to these findings, an improved

273

version of the test has been recently developed). The respective proportion of false-positives

274

obtained based on IF, 0% for IgA and 0,9% for IgG, were lower, indicating higher specificity of

275

the IF readout compared to the ELISA measurements. Importantly, however, false positive

276

readings did not correlate between ELISA and IF (Fig. 4). Thus, classifying only samples that

277

test positive in both assays as true positives resulted in the elimination of false positive results

[29,30]

and

10
278

(0 of 218 positives detected). We conclude that applying both methods in parallel and using the

279

‘double positive’ definition for classification notably improves specificity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody

280

detection.

281

In order to determine the sensitivity of our IF assay, we employed 57 sera from 29

282

symptomatic COVID-19 patients that had been RT-PCR confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

283

Archived sera from these patients had been collected in the range between day 5 and 27 post

284

symptom onset. Again, samples were measured both in IF and ELISA, and the correlation

285

between the semi-quantitative values was assessed as shown in Fig. 5. While there were

deviations in the height of the values, positive correlation was evident in both cases, with values

287

for the IgG readout being more congruent than those for the less specific IgA determination

288

(Pearson r: 0,847 for IgG; 0,655 for IgA).

289

For an assessment of sensitivity, we stratified the samples according to the day post

290

symptom onset, as shown in Fig. 6. and Table 2. For both methods, and for all antibody classes,

291

mean values and the proportion of positive samples increased over time. In all cases, only

292

positive values were obtained for samples collected later than day 14 post symptom onset, in

293

accordance with other reports [30–32]. Consistent with other reports [32], SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM

294

was not detected notably earlier than the two other antibody classes in our measurements. At

295

the earlier time points (up to day 14), a similar or higher proportion of positive samples was

296

detected by IF compared to ELISA for IgG. Although the sample size used here is too small to

297

allow a firm conclusion, these results suggest that the sensitivity of IgG detection by the semi-

298

quantitative IF approach is higher than that of an approved semi-quantitative ELISA assay

299

routinely used in diagnostic labs. In the case of IgA detection at earlier time points (< day 11)

300

ELISA performed slightly better (11/17 samples scored positive) compared to IF (9/17 scored

301

positive) however that came with the price of a very low specificity of ELISA IgA assay (10.6%

302

false negative detection) compared to IF (0.5%).

3. Discussion

304
305

Here, we describe the development of a semi-quantitative IF based assay for detection

306

of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in human samples that complements available ELISA-based

307

testing systems

308

situations where those kits are not available either because they are not yet developed in early

309

days of the pandemic or due to high global demands for tests and required reagents. The

310

microscopy-based assay described here has been developed during the early phase of the

311

COVID-19 pandemic to support the serological testing needs of the University Hospital

312

Heidelberg, Germany and is employed as a confirmatory assay in clinical studies [35] and ongoing

313

studies]. The assay displayed comparable or slightly better sensitivity and specificity than a

314

commercially available semi-quantitative SARS-CoV-2 ELISA approved for diagnostic use at the

315

time. More importantly, combining two technically different serological assays, IF and ELISA,

316

and classifying as “positive hits” only those that scored positive in both assays was instrumental

317

to minimize false positive results while maintaining high sensitivity, and thus serves as a principle

318

for serological studies or diagnostics where specificity of detection is of critical importance.

319

Specificity of detection is essential in settings of relatively low SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence

320

[36–38]

321

global population [39].

[33,34]

. Alternatives to ELISA-based commercial test kits are important in

in conjunction with high prevalence of potentially cross-reactive anti-ccCoV antibodies in a

322

One advantage of the IF based assay presented here is that the specimens used for

323

detection present the entire viral proteome, while ELISA or chemiluminescent approaches use

324

a single recombinantly expressed antigen. Both the N and S protein of coronaviruses are highly

325

immunogenic, and antibodies binding to the receptor binding domain on the S1 subunit are

326

considered most relevant for neutralization. However, the relative importance of antibodies

327

directed against the N protein for potential protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and the

328

possible relevance of the overall breadth of the antibody response is currently unclear. Other

329

SARS-CoV-2 structural and non-structural proteins might play a role in immune response as it

330

was shown for proteins 3a and 9b of the closely related SARS-CoV

331

of the viral proteome in permissive cells ensures correct protein folding and post-translational

332

modification patterns. Alterations in post-translational modifications are likely to influence the

333

ability of serum antibodies to bind to different viral epitopes as it was shown for other viruses

334

such as HIV-1

335

permeabilization of cells, which has the potential to affect epitope preservation. However, based

336

on the high sensitivity of antibody detection and the good correlation to ELISA measurements

337

observed we conclude that this was no major concern in this case.

338

Two major disadvantages of typical IF-based serological assays as applied in the past

339

are manual microscopy acquisition steps and evaluation of samples based on a visual

340

inspection. This procedure is incompatible with high throughput approaches and results are

341

subjective, not quantitative and difficult to standardize. We have addressed these disadvantages

342

by implementing automated microscopy acquisition and developing a robust software platform

343

that is able to identify individual cells, classify infected and non-infected cells and take into

344

account specific and non-specific background in order to generate semi-quantitative results.

345

Depending on the context of a study and the questions to be addressed, sensitivity or specificity

346

may be of higher importance. The automated image analysis protocol developed here allows the

347

user to adapt the classification according to the study needs, putting more weight on either one

348

of the parameters.

349

Automated image acquisition and image analysis presented here are compatible with a

350

high throughput approach. Plates with fixed samples of infected cells can be prepared in

351

advance and stored at 4°C for several weeks. In the manual workflow used here, four 96-well

352

plates (384 samples) could easily be analysed within a typical work day (1.5 h for

353

immunofluorescence, 1.5 h for image acquisition, 2 h of image analysis). This is already the

354

throughput in the range of some ELISA-based automated systems used in diagnostics and is

355

sufficient for urgent applications in an early phase of disease response. The major disadvantage

356

of the procedure described here for a virus like SARS-CoV-2 is the requirement of a BSL3

357

containment area to generate virus stocks and produce infected cell specimens. Recombinant

358

cell lines expressing key viral antigens can address this drawback and also allows to easily

359

implement already established automated cell seeding and immunostaining pipelines for a true

360

high-throughput application

361

[44]

362

antibodies (IgM, IgG and IgA), but also identification of the viral antigens recognized, in a single

363

multiplexed approach. The high information content of the IF data (differential staining patterns)

364

together with a machine learning-based approach [45] and the implementation of stable cell lines

365

expressing selected viral antigens in the IF assay will provide additional parameters for

366

classification of patient sera and further improve sensitivity and specificity of the presented IF

367

assay.

[42,43]

. Combining such cell lines with spectral unmixing microscopy

would not only enable simultaneous determination of levels of all three major classes of

368

The described analysis pipeline can be readily applied for serological analysis of other

369

virus infections, provided that an infectable cell line and a staining procedure that allows

370

differentiating between infected and non-infected cells are available. The assay described here

371

thus offers potential as an immediate response to any future virus pandemic, as it can be rapidly

372

deployed from the moment the first isolate of the pathogen has been obtained without requiring

373

information on the expression of immunogenicity of viral proteins.

374

375

4. Materials and Methods

376

4.1 Human material

377

Negative control serum samples (n=218) were collected for various serological testing in the

378

routine laboratory of the Center of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Heidelberg between

379

2015 and 2019, before the start of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Samples used corresponded to

380

pseudonymized remaining material from the archive of the Center of Infectious Diseases

381

Heidelberg. SARS-CoV-2 positive sera were collected from 29 PCR confirmed symptomatic

382

COVID-19 inpatients (n=17) or outpatients (n=12) treated at the University Hospital Heidelberg

383

under general informed consent (ethics votum no S-148/2020, University Hospital Heidelberg).

384

Days post symptom onset were defined based on the anamnesis carried out upon admission.

385

Serum samples were stored at -20°C until use.

386

4.2 Virus stock production

387

VeroE6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Life Technologies)

388

containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin and 1% non-

389

essential amino acids (complete medium).

390

SARS-CoV-2 virus stocks were produced by amplification of the BavPat1/2020 strain (European

391

Virus Archive) in VeroE6 cells. To generate the seed virus (passage 3), VeroE6 cells were

392

infected with the original virus isolate, received as passage 2, at an MOI of 0.01. At 48 h post

393

infection (p.i.), the supernatant was harvested and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at

394

800xg for 10 min. For production of virus stocks (passage 4), 500µl of the seed virus was used

395

to infect 9x106 VeroE6 cells. The resulting supernatant was harvested 48h later as described

396

above. Virus titers were determined by plaque assay. Briefly, 2.5x106 VeroE6 cells were plated

397

into 24 well plates. 24 h later, cells were infected with serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h.

398

Inoculum was then removed and the cells were overlaid with serum free DMEM containing 0.8%

carboxymethylcellulose. At 72 h. p.i., cells were fixed with 5% formaldehyde for 1 h followed by

400

staining with 1% Crystal violet solution. Plaque forming units per ml (PFU/ml) were estimated by

401

manual counting of the viral plaques. Stock solutions were stored in aliquots at -80°C until use

402

for infection experiments.

403

4.3 Infection of cells and immunofluorescence staining

404

In order to find a suitable cell line for our application, we performed pre-experiments comparing

405

different cell lines with respect to their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cells were seeded

406

on glass coverslips and infected on the following day with SARS-CoV-2 strain BavPat1/2020 for

407

16h at MOI 0.01. Cells were fixed with 6%PFA in PBS, followed by permeabilisation with 0.5%

408

Triton X100 in PBS and then subjected to a standard immunofluorescence staining protocol as

409

described in materials and methods. Only very few infected calls were detected in the case of

410

hepatocyte-derived carcinoma cells (HUH-7), human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) and human

411

alveolar basal epithelial (A549) cells (Fig. S1). Calu-3 cells grew in small clumps, often on top of

412

each other which impacted our microscopy-based readout. In contrast, VeroE6 cells grew as a

413

monolayer and were viable for at least 24 h p.i. Based on these results, VeroE6 cells were

414

chosen for all experiments in this manuscript.

415

For serum screening by IF microscopy, VeroE6 cells were seeded at a density of 7,000 cells per

416

well into a black-wall glass-bottom 96 well plates (Corning, Product Number 353219) or on glass

417

coverslips placed in a 24-well plate. 24 h after seeding, cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at

418

an MOI of 0.01 for 16 h. Cells were then fixed with 6% Formaldehyde for 1 h followed by washing

419

3x with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) under biosafety level 3. Afterwards, samples were

420

handled under biosafety level 2. Cells were washed once in PBS containing 0,02% Tween 20

421

(Sigma) and permeabilised using 0,5% Triton X100 (Sigma) for 10 minutes. Samples were

422

washed again and blocked using 2% powdered milk (Roth) in PBS for 20 min followed by two

423

additional washing steps. All washing steps in a 96-well format were performed using the

424

HydroFlex microplate washer (Tecan). Next, cells were incubated with patient serum (prediluted

425

1:1 in 0,4% Triton-X100 in PBS; further dilution 1:50 in PBS if not stated otherwise) and anti-ds-

426

RNA mouse monoclonal J2 antibody (Scicons, 1:4000) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature.

427

After 3 washing steps, cognate secondary antibodies were applied for 20 min at room

428

temperature. Goat anti-human IgG-AlexaFluor 488 (Invitrogen, Thermofisher Scientific), goat

429

anti-human IgA DyLight 650 (Abcam), goat anti-human IgM u chain (Invitrogen, Thermofisher

in PBS, have been used. After incubation with secondary antibodies cells were washed twice,

433

stained with Hoechst (0,002µg/ml in PBS) for 3 minutes, washed again twice and stored at +4°C

434

until imaging.

435

4.4 Microscopy

436

Samples were imaged on motorized Nikon Ti2 widefield microscope using a Plan Apo lambda

437

20x/0.75 air objective and a back-illuminated EM-CCD camera (Andor iXon DU-888). To

438

automatically acquire images in 96-well format, the JOBS module was used. The system was

439

configured to acquire 9 images per well (in a regular 3 x 3 pattern centered in the middle of each

440

well). The Perfect Focus System was used for autofocusing followed by a software-based fine

441

focusing using the Hoechst signal in an axial range of 40um. Images were acquired in 4 channels

442

using the following excitation/emission settings: Ex 377/50, Em 447/60 (Hoechst); Ex 482/35,

443

Em 536/40 (AlexaFluor 488); Ex 562/40, Em 624/40 (AlexaFluor 568) and Ex 628/40, Em 692/40

444

(AlexaFluor 647 and DyLight 650). Exposure times were in the range between 50 and 100ms

445

with EM gain between 50 and 150.

446
447

4.5 Enzyme linked immuno- sorbent assay (ELISA)

448

ELISA measurements for determination of reactivity against the S1 domain of the viral spike

449

protein were carried out using the Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) and Anti-SARS-

450

CoV-2-ELISA (IgG) test kits (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany; EI 2606-9601 A and EI 2606-9601

451

G) run on an Euroimmun Analyzer I instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

452

Optical densities measured for the samples were normalized using the value obtained for a

453

calibrator sample provided in the test kit. The interpretation of the semi-quantitative ratiometric

454

values obtained followed the manufacturer’s protocol: values <0.8 were classified as negative,

455

0.8-1.1 as borderline, and values of 1.1 or higher as positive.

456

4.6 Image Analysis

457

Manual Annotations

458

Two of our processing steps require manually annotated data: in order to train the convolutional

459

neural network used for boundary and foreground prediction, we needed label masks for the

460

individual cells. To determine suitable parameters for the infected cell classification, we needed

461

a set of cells classified as being infected or non-infected. We have produced these annotations

462

for 10 images with the following steps. First, we created an initial segmentation following the

463

approach outlined in the Segmentation subsection, using boundary and foreground predictions

464

from the ilastik

465

annotations. We then corrected this segmentation using the annotation tool BigCat

466

(https://github.com/saalfeldlab/bigcat). After correction, we manually annotated these cells as

467

infected or non-infected. Note that this mode of annotations can introduce two types of bias: the

468

segmentation labels are derived from an initial segmentation. Small systematic errors in the

469

initial segmentation that were not found during correction, could influence the boundary

470

prediction network. More importantly, when annotating the infected / non-infected cells, both the

471

serum channel and the virus marker channel have to be available to the annotators, in order to

472

visually delineate the cells. This may result in subconscious bias, with the observed intensity in

473

the serum channel influencing the decision on the infection status of a cell.

475

Preprocessing

476

On all acquired images, we performed minimal preprocessing (i.e., flat-field correction) in order

477

compensate for uneven illumination of the microscope system

478

CCD camera offset (ccd_offset). Secondly, we correct uneven illumination by dividing each

479

channel by a corresponding corrector image (flatfield(𝑥, 𝑦)), which was obtained as a normalized

480

average of all images of that channel, smoothed by a normalized convolution with a Gaussian

481

filter with a bandwidth of 30 pixels.
processed(𝑥, 𝑦) =

raw(𝑥, 𝑦) − ccd_offset
flatfield(𝑥, 𝑦) − ccd_offset

[47]

. First, we subtract a constant

Eq. 2

482

This corrector image was obtained for all images of a given microscope set-up. Full background

483

subtraction is performed later in the pipeline using either the background measured on wells that

484

(deliberately) do not contain any serum or, if not available, using a fixed value that was

485

determined manually.

486
487

Segmentation

488

Cell segmentation forms the basis of our analysis method. In order to obtain an accurate

489

segmentation, we make use of both the DAPI and the serum channel. First, we segment the

490

nuclei on the DAPI channel using the StarDist method

491

2019

492

assigned a unique ID. In addition, we predict per pixel probabilities for the boundaries between

[19]

trained on data from Caicedo et al.

[48]

. Note that this method yields an instance segmentation: each nucleus in the image is

cells and for the foreground (i.e. whether a given pixel is part of a cell) using a 2D U-Net

494

based on the implementation of Wolny et al. 2020

495

annotated images, see above. The cells are then segmented by the seeded watershed algorithm

496

[18]

497

as the height map. In addition, we threshold the foreground predictions, erode the resulting

498

binary image by 20 pixels and intersect it with the binarised seeds. The result is used as a

499

foreground mask for the watershed. The dilation / erosion is performed to alleviate issues with

500

very small nucleus segments / imprecise foreground predictions. In order to evaluate this

501

segmentation method, we train 9 different networks using leave-one-out cross-validation,

502

training each network on 8 of the manually annotated images and evaluating it on the remaining

503

one. We measure the segmentation quality using average precision

504

union (IoU) threshold of 0.5 as described in https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-

505

2018/overview/evaluation. We measure a value of 0.77 +- 0.08 with the optimum value being

506

1.0.

Quantitation and Scoring

509

Infection classification

510

To distinguish infected cells from control cells we use the dsRNA virus marker channel: infected

511

cells show a signal in this channel while the non-infected control cells should ideally be invisible

512

(see Fig. 3). We classified each cell in the cell segmentation (see above) individually, using the

513

following procedure. First, we denoised the marker channel using a white tophat filter with a

514

radius of 20 pixels. To account for inaccuracies in the cell segmentation (the exact position of

515

cell borders is not always clear), we then eroded all cell masks with a radius of 5 pixels and

516

thereby discard pixels close to segment boundaries. This step does not lead to information loss,

517

since the virus marker is mostly concentrated around the nuclei. On the remaining pixels of each

518

cell, we compute the 0.95 quantile (𝑞) of the intensity in the marker channel. For the pixels that

519

the neural network predicts to belong to the background (𝑏), we compute the median intensity

520

of the virus marker channel across all images in the current plate. Finally, we classify the cell as

521

infected if the 0.95 quantile of its intensity exceeds the median background by more than a given

522

threshold:
𝑞 − median(𝑏) > 𝑡

Eq. 3

18
523

For additional robustness against intensity variations we adapt the threshold based on the

524

variation in the background in the plate. Hence, we define it as a multiple of the mean absolute

525

deviation of all background pixels of that plate with N=4.8:
𝑡 = 𝑁 ∙ mad(𝑏)

Eq. 4

526

To determine the optimal values of the parameters used in our procedure, we used the cells

527

manually annotated as infected / non-infected (see above). We performed grid search over the

528

following parameter ranges:

529

 Quantile: 0.9, 0.93, 0.95, 0.96, 0.97, 0.98, 0.99, 0.995

530

 𝑁: 0 to 10 in intervals of 0.1

531

To estimate the validation accuracy, we performed leave-one-out cross-validation on the image

532

level. This yields an average validation F1 score of 84.3%, precision of 84.3% and recall of

533

84.8%. These values are the arithmetic means of the individual results per split.

534
535

Immunoglobulin intensity measurements

536
537

In order to obtain a relative measure of antibody binding, we determined the mean intensity and

538

the integrated intensity in each segmented cell from images recorded in the IgG, IgA or IgM

539

channel. A comparative analysis revealed that the mean intensity was more robust against the

540

variability of cell sizes, whereas using the integrated intensity as a proxy yielded a higher

541

variance in non-infected cells. Thus, mean intensity per cell was chosen as a proxy for the

542

amount of antibody bound. Non-specific auto-fluorescence signals required a background

543

correction of the measured average serum channel intensities. For background normalization,

544

we used cells (one well per plate) which were not immunostained with primary antiserum. From

545

this we computed the background to be the median serum intensity of all pixels of images taken

546

from this well. This value was subtracted from all images recorded from the respective plate. In

547

case this control well was not available, background was subtracted manually by selecting the

548

area outside of cells in randomly selected wells and measuring the median intensity.

549
550

Scoring

551

The core interest of the assay is to measure the difference of antibody binding to cells infected

552

with the coronavirus in comparison to non-infected control cells. To this end, utilizing the results

553

of the image analysis, we compute the following summary statistics of the background corrected

554

antibody binding of infected cells, 𝐼, and of non-infected cells, 𝑁:

We compute above scores for each well and each image, taking into account only the cells that

556

passed all quality control criteria (see below). While the final readout of the assay is well-based,

557

image scores are useful for quality control.

Decision threshold selection

560

In order to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in patient sera, it was

561

necessary to define a decision threshold r*. If a measured intensity ratio r is above a decision

562

threshold r* than the serum would be characterized as positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. For

563

this an ROC analysis was performed

564

particular sensitivity/specificity pair. By continuously varying the decision threshold, we

565

measured all possible sensitivity/specificity pairs, known as ROC curves (Fig. S7). To determine

566

the appropriate r* we considered two factors [26]:

[28]

. Each possible choice of r* for a test corresponds to a

567
568

●

569
570

The undesirability of errors or relative cost of false-positive and false-negative
classifications

●

The prevalence, or prior probability of disease

571
572

These factors can be combined to calculate a slope in the ROC plot[26–28]
𝑚=

573

(𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡) (1 − 𝑃)
(𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡) 𝑃

Eq. 11

where 𝑃 is the prevalence or prior probability of disease.

574
575

The optimal decision threshold r*, given the false-positive/false-negative cost ratio and

576

prevalence, is the point on the ROC curve where a line with slope m touches the curve. As

discussed in the main text, a major concern regarding serological assays for SARS-CoV-2

578

antibody detection is the occurrence of false-positive results. Therefore, we choose m to be

579

larger than one in our analysis. In particular, we determine r* for the choice of m=10 (see Fig.

580

S7).

581

Quality control

582

We performed quality control of the images and analysis results at the level of wells, images and

583

cells. The entities that did not pass quality control are not taken into account when computing

584

the score during final analysis. We exclude wells that contain less than 100 non-infected cells,

585

that have a median serum intensity of infected cells smaller than 3 times the noise level

586

(measured by the median absolute deviation), or that have negative intensity ratios, which can

587

happen due to the background subtraction. Out of 1.736 wells, 94 did not pass the quality control,

588

corresponding to 5.4 % of wells. At the image level, we visually inspect all images and mark

589

those that contain imaging artifacts using a viewer based on napari

590

following types of artifacts during the visual inspection: empty, unstained or over-saturated

591

images, as well as images covered by a large bright object. In addition, we automatically exclude

592

images that contain less than 10 or more than 1000 cells. These thresholds are motivated by

593

the observation that too few or too many cells often result from a problem in the assay. Thus,

594

296 of the total 15.624 images were excluded from further analysis, corresponding to 1.9 % of

595

images. Out of these, 295 were manually marked as outliers and only a single one did not pass

596

the subsequent automatic quality control. Finally, we automatically exclude segmented cells with

597

a size smaller than 250 pixels or larger than 12.500 pixels that most likely correspond to

598

segmentation errors. These limits were derived by the histogram of cell sizes investigated for

599

several plates. Two percent of the approximate 5.5 million segmented cells did not pass this

600

quality control. In addition, we have also inspected all samples scored as positives. For the IgA

601

channel, we have found a dotty staining pattern in ten cases that produced positive hits based

602

on intensity ratio in negative control cohorts, but does not appear to indicate a specific antibody

603

response. We have also excluded these samples from further analysis.

604

Implementation

605

In order to scale the analysis workflow to the large number of images produced by the assay,

606

we implemented an open-source python library to run the individual analysis steps. This library

607

allows rerunning experiments for a given plate for newly added data on demand and caches

608

intermediate results in order to rerun the analysis from checkpoints in case of errors in one of

[49]

. We distinguish the

609

the processing steps. To this end, we use a file layout based on hdf5 [50] to store multi-resolution

610

image data and tabular data. The processing steps are parallelized over the images of a plate if

611

possible. We use efficient implementations for the U-Net

612

algorithm (http://ukoethe.github.io/vigra/) as well as other image processing algorithms

613

use pytorch (https://pytorch.org/) to implement GPU-accelerated cell feature extraction. The

614

total processing time for a plate (containing around 800 images) is about two hours and thirty

615

minutes using a single GPU and 8 CPU cores. In addition, the results of the analysis as well as

616

meta-data associated with individual plates are automatically saved in a centralized MongoDB

617

database (https://www.mongodb.com) at the end of the workflow execution. Apart from keeping

618

track of the analysis outcome and meta-data, a user can save additional information about a

619

given plate/well/image in the database conveniently using the PlateViewer (see below). All

brightness and contrast settings. In the lower panels the brightness and contrast scales have

847

been expanded in order to visualize cells in the IgG serum channel where only background

848

staining was detected. Scale bar is 20 µm in overview and 10 µm in the insets.

Figure 2: Schematic overview of the image processing pipeline. Initially, images are

853

subjected to the first manual quality control, where images with acquisition defects are

854

discarded. A pre-processing step is then applied to correct for barrel artifacts. Subsequently,

855

segmentation is obtained via seeded watershed, this algorithm requires seeds obtained from

856

StarDist segmentation of the nuclei and boundary evidence computed using a neural network.

857

Lastly, using the virus marker channel we classify each cell as infected or not infected and we

858

computed the scoring. A final automated quality control identifies and automatically discards

859

non-conform results. All intermediate results are saved in a database for ensuring fully

860

reproducibility of the results.

877

black, mycoplasma positive. Bottom panels represent zoomed-in versions of the respective top

878

panel to illustrate the borderline region. (C) IgM values for the indicated negative control cohorts

879

determined by IF. Since a corresponding IgM specific ELISA kit from Euroimmun was not

880

available, correlation was not analysed in this case. In some cases, antibody binding above

881

background was undetectable by IF in non-infected as well as in infected cells, indicating low

882

unspecific cross-reactivity and lack of specific reactivity of the respective serum. In order to allow

883

for inclusion of these data points in the graph, the IF ratio was set to 1,0. Dotted lines indicate

884

the optimal separation cut-off values defined for sample classification, grey areas indicate

885

borderline results in ELISA.
