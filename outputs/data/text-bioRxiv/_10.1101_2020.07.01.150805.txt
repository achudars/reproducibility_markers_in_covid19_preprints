Abstract
Novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is emerging as a pandemic situation and
declared as a global health emergency by WHO. Due to lack of specific medicine and
vaccine, viral infection has gained a frightening rate and created a devastating state across the
globe. Here the authors have attempted to design epitope based potential peptide as a vaccine
candidate using immunoinformatics approach. As of evidence from literatures, SARS-CoV-2
Spike protein is a key protein to initiate the viral infection within a host cell thus used here as
a reasonable vaccine target. We have predicted a 9-mer peptide as representative of both Bcell and T-cell epitopic region along with suitable properties such as antigenic and nonallergenic. To its support, strong molecular interaction of the predicted peptide was also
observed with MHC molecules and Toll Like receptors. The present study may helpful to
step forward in the development of vaccine candidates against COVID-19.

Introduction
The disease COVID-19 outbreak caused due to emergence of novel severe acute respiratory
syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. According to WHO, the novel corona virus has
affected more than 5.5 million people with a fatality of 3, 46,969 across the globe as of May
25, 2020. Respiratory droplets, direct contact and fecal-to-oral transmission are conventional
routs for SARS-CoV-2 [2]. The symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection include fever, dry
cough, shortness of breath, runny nose and sore throat [3, 4]. The rate of transmission and
death is gaining severity due to ignorance of specific drug and vaccine against it.
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus and its genome is around
29.7 kB long with twelve putative open reading frames (ORFs) that encode different
structural and non-structural proteins. The first SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1) genome was
successfully sequenced and submitted to GenBank on January 5, 2020 (Accession no.
MN908947.3) [3]. One-third of the genome is responsible for coding the structural proteins in
SARS-CoV-2, namely, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) of
SARS-CoV-2 are potential antigen for neutralizing antibody preparation and may be
prospective therapeutics [5]. After entering into host body, the virion attaches to the host cell
membrane and the viral Spike protein S1interacts with a functional host cell receptor known
as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thereafter, Spike protein S2 mediates the
fusion of the virion and cellular membranes by acting as a class I viral fusion protein [6].
During this phase, the protein attains at least three conformational states: pre-fusion native
state, pre-hairpin intermediate state, and post-fusion hairpin state [7]. As SARS-CoV-2 S
glycoprotein is surface-attached and has potentiality to initiates the infection thus could be a
promising vaccine target. In this connection, epitope based peptide design have remarkable
privilege than conventional vaccine development. Peptide based vaccine are most popular
since they are specific, generate long lasting immunity, able to avoid undesirable immune
responses and are reasonably cheaper [8]. In addition, epitope based vaccine design has been
aided by robust computational techniques [9]. Therefore, authors have focused on discovery
of epitope from SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein.
The T-cell epitopes are typically peptide fragments, whereas the B-cell epitopes can
be proteins, lipids, nucleic acids or carbohydrates [10, 11, 12]. Based on literature, the
peptide is considered sufficient for activation of the appropriate cellular and humoral
responses as it is the fragment of antigenic protein [13, 14]. Here we have identified peptide
as vaccine candidate as the peptide vaccines are comparatively easy for production,

chemically stable, and absence of infectious potential [15]. The present study would throw
lights on vaccine development against COVID-19.
Materials and method
Sequence retrieval
Protein sequence of S glycoprotein was retrieved from UniProt (ID: P0DTC2) database [16].
The Gene name is “S” which belongs to Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2
(2019-nCoV) (SARS-CoV-2).
B-cell epitope prediction
The B-cell epitopic regions present in SARS-CoV-2 S protein were identified using BcePred
prediction server (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/cgibin/bcepred/) [17]. It helped to predict linear
epitopes from S protein sequence using physico-chemical properties.
T-cell epitope prediction
MHC binding prediction includes the prediction of binding sites for both CD4+ and CD8+.
The IEDB analysis resource (http://tools.iedb.org/main/) predicts specific T-cell epitopes to
bind with MHC class I molecules along with IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration)
values. Similarly, it employs different methods to predict MHC Class II epitopes, including a
consensus approach which combines NN-align, SMM-align and combinatorial library
methods [18].
Interaction with MHC molecules
The crystal structure of HLA-B*35:01 (PDB ID: 4LNR) presenting MHC class I molecule in
complex form with the peptide (RPQVPLRPMTY) was retrieved from PDB database [19].
Similarly, as representative of MHC-II, the crystal structure of HLA-DR1 (PDB ID: 1T5X) in
complex form with a synthetic peptide (AAYSDQATPLLLSPR) was retrieved from PDB.
PepFold server [20, 21] was used to build the tertiary structural model of predicted peptides.
Molecular docking was performed between the predicted peptides and MHC representative
structures using PatchDock web server [22, 23, 24].
Antigenicity and allergenicity prediction
Determination of antigenic and allergenic properties are two important factor related to
peptide based vaccine designing. The antigenicity of predicted peptides was calculated using
VaxiJen tool [25] with the cut off value 0.4. AllerTOP v. 2.0 [26] and AllergenFP v.1.0 tool
[27] was used to predict allergenic property of predicted peptides.
Physico-chemical properties prediction

In order to find the molecular properties of predicted peptides, Innovagen’s peptide calculator
was used. It makes calculations and estimations on physiochemical properties like peptide
molecular weight, peptide extinction coefficient, peptide net charge at neutral pH and peptide
iso-electric point.
Interaction with Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs)
Crystal structures of human Toll-Like receptors such as TLR2 (PDB ID: 6NIG) and TLR4
(PDB ID: 4G8A) was extracted from PDB and subjected for structural preparation.
Interaction of both TLR2 and TLR4 structures with the predicted peptides were performed
using PatchDock web server [22, 23, 24].
Results and Discussion
Sequence retrieval and antigenic property prediction of SARS-CoV-2 ‘S’ protein
The complete sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (UniProt ID: P0DTC2) is of 1,273 amino
acids length. Average antigenic propensity was calculated as 1.0416 from 63 antigenic
determinants within its primary sequence. The antigenic plot (Figure 1) between amino acid
residues with respect to propensity strongly established S protein antigenicity.

B-cell and T-cell epitope prediction
Prediction of B-cell epitope is a crucial step in epitope base vaccine design [28]. Linear Bcell epitope region of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was identified with the help of its physicchemical properties. Similarly the tabular representation of B-cell epitope reveals the amino
acid at 84, 85, 91, 92 in pep-9 and 521, 522, 523, 524, 525 in pep-15 belongs to the B-cell
epitopic region (Figure 2).

protein. (A) and (B) represents the graphical representation of selected amino acid regions.
(C) and (D) represents the epitopic scoring of each amino acid from predicted peptides.

T-cell epitope prediction is also known as a well establish method in vaccine discovery. Here
we identified more than 100 T-cell epitopes with different percentile rank for the whole
protein length. Basically, peptides with least percentile rank indicate their higher binding
affinity against T-cell. therefore only five peptides within 0.01 to 0.03 percentile rank were
found suitable for CD8+. Among them, four peptides with amino acid position 39-47, 4553, 39-47 and 27-35 were suitable for HLA-B27 molecule where as the only peptide (24-32)
suitability attached with HLA-B35 molecules. Further, the 9-mer peptide (Pep-9)
LPFNDGVYF (84-92 amino acid) was represented for both B-cell and CD8+ T-cell
therefore, selected for this study. Similarly, in case of CD4+ T-cell epitope prediction, out of
five top ranked peptides (0.01 percentile) none of them were represented by B-cell thus
discarded. Furthermore, one 15-mer (511-525 amino acid) peptide (VVLSFELLHAPATVC)

(Pep-15) was identified suitable for both B-cell and CD4+ T-cell epitope (percentile rank
0.03) region.
Molecular interaction between peptides and MHC molecules
Structure of MHC-I molecule namely HLA-B*35:01 (PDB ID: 4LNR) was identified as most
suitable for Pep-9 (LPFNDGVYF). Similarly, MHC-II molecule HLA-DR1 (PDB ID: 1T5X)
was found suitable for Pep-15 (AAYSDQATPLLLSPR). The attached synthetic peptides
were removed from their respective crystal structures in order to free the peptide binding
sites. Molecular docking was performed between representative structures of MHC molecules
and suitable peptide candidates in order to inspect their molecular interaction. Independent
dock run was performed in both of the system which produced ten binding complex for each
of docking. Five top ranked docked complexes were reported with atomic contact energy
(ACE) scores (Table 1). The ACE plays an important role in peptide binding efficacy which
is known to be negative in strong interaction. Therefore, model 5 i.e. HLA-B*35:01-Pep9
(dock score: 7394; interaction area: 940.60Å; ACE: -191.22 kcal/mol) and model1 i.e. HLADR1-Pep15 (dock score: 8852; interaction area: 1152.50 Å; ACE: -236.54kcal/mol) were
selected for Pep-9 and Pep-15 peptide binding for further analysis.

Interestingly, Pep-9 was interacted within the known peptide binding site (LYS58, GLU212,
ALA211, SER4, ASP29 and ASP30) of the HLA-B*35:01 structure (PDB ID: 4LNR) where
as Pep-15 was bound within a different functional site (THR77, ARG71, GLU55, GLN57 and
ASN62) of HLA-DR1 structure (PDB ID: 1T5X) (Table 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) which
signified about the suitability of Pep-9 as a potential vaccine candidate.

Analysis of antigenic, allergenic and physico-chemical properties of predicted peptide
candidates
Antigenic peptides increase the immunogenicity of vaccine candidate therefore prediction of
antigenic property is an essential step in immunoinformatics based vaccine design. In this
study, both of the peptide Pep-9 (antigenic score: 0.5593) and Pep-15 (antigenic score:
0.8618) was showed above threshold value (0.4) thus established as suitable antigenic
peptides. In addition, both of the peptides were predicted as non-allergen by AllerTOP v. 2.0
and AllergenFP v.1.0 tools. Further, molecular weight of Pep-9 and Pep-15 were calculated
as 1071.18 g/mol and 1598.91 g/mol respectively. To its support, hydropathy calculation
determined about the hydrophobic nature of both peptides (Figure 5). However, overall
analysis confirmed about the effectiveness of both Pep-9 and Pep-15.

Interaction of peptides with TLR2 and TLR4
The potential role of Toll-Like receptor mediated host-parasites interaction is well
established. Particularly, TLR2 and TLR4 are well known mediums for interaction between
filarial parasites and host innate immune system [11, 14, 15]. Therefore, in this study we
have studied the interaction between predicted peptides (Pep-9 and Pep-15) and Toll-Like
receptors (TLR2 and TLR4). The result suggested Pep-9 more strongly interacted with TLR2
than TLR4 (Table 3, Figure 6). Further, strongest binding affinity (ACE score) was observed
between TLR2-Pep15 docked complex (Table 3, Figure 6). Moreover, Pep-9 is found more
significantly binding with both TLR2 and TLR4 (Table 3, Figure 6).

Conclusion
This study is focused on the prediction of effective epitopes from Spike protein of SARSCoV-2. Among all possible epitopes, Pep-9 and Pep-15 were claimed as more effective
candidates. Again, it was observed that the Pep-9 as more suitable than Pep-15 in order to be
a possible vaccine candidates. Further, in vitro and in vivo validation is required to confirm
the prediction. Overall, this study would be informative towards new vaccine development
for prevention of widespread COVID-19.
