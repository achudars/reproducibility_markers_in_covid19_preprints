Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 and its induced COVID-19 remains as a global health calamity. Severe
symptoms and high mortality, caused by cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress
syndrome in the lower respiratory airway, are always associated with elderly
individuals and those with comorbidities; whereas mild or moderate COVID-19
patients have limited upper respiratory flu-like symptoms. There is an urgent need to
investigate SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses replication and immune responses
in human respiratory systems. The human reconstituted airway epithelial air-liquid
interface (ALI) models are the most physiologically relevant model for the investigation
of coronavirus infection and virus-triggered innate immune signatures. We established
ALI models representing both the upper and the lower respiratory airway to
characterize the coronavirus infection kinetics, tissue pathophysiology, and innate
immune signatures from upper and lower respiratory tract perspective. Our data
suggested these in vitro ALI models maintain high physiological relevance with human
airway tissues. The coronavirus induced immune response observed in these upper
and lower respiratory airway models are similar to what has been reported in COVID19 patients. The antiviral efficacy results of a few promising anti-coronavirus drugs in
these models were consistent with previous reports and could be valuable for the
human dose prediction. Taken together, our study demonstrates the importance of 3D
airway epithelial ALI model for the understanding of coronavirus pathogenesis and the
discovery and development of anti-coronavirus drugs.

Introduction
Global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARSCoV-2 infection is a serious global health threat. As of one year after its outbreak in
Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (WHO COVID-19 weekly epidemiological update),
more than 100 million cases and nearly 2.3 million deaths worldwide have been
confirmed. Most patients with COVID-19 exhibit mild to moderate symptoms of upper
respiratory tract. However, nearly 15% of patients progress to severe lower respiratory
tract symptoms such as pneumonia and about 5% eventually develop lung acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or cytokine storm syndrome (Huang et al., 2020;
Xu et al., 2020b). The odds of severe symptoms are higher with elder people (Meftahi
et al., 2020). The fatality rate for COVID-19 patients aged ≥ 60 years was 63.6% from
the initial data of Wuhan, which is significantly higher than that of patients < 60 years
(Chen et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020).
The human respiratory tract is a highly specialized organ comprising upper and
lower tracts, both of which are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Lui et al., 2020).
A deep understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and its induced clinical features
require comprehensive characterization of the virus infection and the associated host
response. However, Vero E6 cell-based infection assay, the most frequently used
system for the assessment of anti-SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, has limitations in
physiological relevance. Several reported in vitro lung models can complement animal
models for the deep understanding of pathological mechanisms of respiratory viruses
(Miller and Spence, 2017; Takayama, 2020), among which the human reconstituted
airway epithelial air-liquid interface (ALI) models are highly relevant and useful tools
for pre-clinical studies of COVID-19 (Mulay et al., 2020). Human bronchial epithelial
cells (NHBE) or small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) differentiated in the air/liquid

interphase represents the human upper or lower respiratory tract, respectively. These
ALI models reflect similar human respiratory epithelium anatomy features, including
the main structure, function and innate immune responses in the early stages of virus
infection and constitute robust surrogates to study respiratory viral infections (Boda et
al., 2018). A few studies characterized the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the proximal
airway NHBE ALI (Hao et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). In contrast, the investigation of
SARS-CoV-2 replication in the human small airways has not been reported. In line
with the severe symptoms of COVID-19 in lower respiratory tract, the detrimental
outcomes of virus infection often related with immune dysregulation in lower
respiratory tract, termed as “cytokine storm” (Song et al., 2020). Accumulating
evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 might have a
cytokine storm syndrome (Huang et al., 2020; Pedersen and Ho, 2020; Zhou et al.,
2020). Therefore, a thorough characterization of both the upper and lower respiratory
airway in the context of coronavirus infection is in urgent need for the understanding
of COVID-19 immunopathology and anti-coronavirus drug discovery.
Here, we reconstituted the human upper (NHBE) and lower (SAEC) respiratory
airway from primary epithelial cells of bronchial and small airway origin and
characterized their structural, functional and innate immune features. We also
investigated coronavirus infection kinetics, tissue pathology, and transcriptional
immune signatures induced by the coronavirus infection in these ALI models. Our data
suggest that SAEC ALI, a novel 3D airway epithelial ALI model, represents
comparable anatomy features and gene expression profile of human airway tissues.
Besides, innate immune responses and cytokine profile generated from NHBE and
SAEC models are similar to the data from patients in both upper and lower respiratory
tracts. We further validated the potential of SAEC ALI for evaluating antiviral drugs

against SRAS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Our results provide important insights
into coronaviruses kinetics, pathogenesis, and innate immune responses, and suggest
the combination treatment of the polymerase inhibitor and the 3C-like protease
inhibitor would be potential beneficial for the COVID-19.

Results
Characterization of the in vitro 3D airway ALI model of differentiated human
bronchial and small airway epithelial cells
Recent studies focused on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis investigation or antiviral
drug evaluation were mainly rely on cell lines or primary epithelial cells (Choy et al.,
2020). However, these monolayer cultures consist only basal cells and could not fully
sustain viral replication and innate immune activation. Therefore, two ALI models,
NHBE ALI representing part of the upper respiratory tract and SAEC ALI representing
part of the lower respiratory tract, were established to investigate the coronavirus
replication kinetics and innate immune activation in human airways A fully
differentiated pseudostratified epithelial layer was determined to be achieved by 4
weeks post air-lifted (Fig. 1A and 1B). The ALI culture thickness of both SAEC and
NHBE at 4 weeks were around ten times thinner to what was reported for in vivo
human airway epithelium, and NHBE ALI was nearly three times thicker than SAEC
ALI culture (Fig. 1A and 1B) (Weibel, 1990). The differentiation capability of the
primary airway epithelial cells was largely associated with the age of donor. The
younger the donor is, the higher the potential to be differentiated (Fig. 1B). The cilia
beating of SAEC ALI and NHBE ALI indicates the successful differentiation of the
ciliated epithelium (Fig. S1A,). The in vitro airway ALI model has tight junctions and
distinct apical and basolateral membranes. High transendothelial electrical resistance

(TEER) value implies the formation of an impermeable tight junction at the apical side.
The TEER value of SAEC and NHBE ALI was measured every 2-3 days for up to 60
days. The TEER value for NHBE ALI reached to a maximum value of about 1400
Ω*cm2 at 2-3 weeks post air-lifted and gradually dropped to around 300 Ω*cm2 after
35 days post air-lifted. In contrast, the TEER value of SAEC ALI did not decrease after
reaching plateau, and the plateau value is ~300 Ω*cm2, which is 3.6-fold less
compared with NHBE ALI (Fig. 1C). The data demonstrate the upper and lower
respiratory airways differ in morphology and differentiation, which might lead to
differential outcomes upon viral infections.
Next, the transcriptome profile of SAEC and NHBE ALI cultures was
examined by RNA sequencing experiments. To characterize the similarity between the
in vitro ALI model and the in vivo human respiratory airway tissues, we analyzed the
enrichment of the signature genes derived from lung scRNA-seq data (Deprez et al.,
2020; Travaglini et al., 2020), and found that SAEC and NHBE ALI samples were
indeed enriched with the signature genes in human lung epithelial cells (Fig. 1D and
Fig. S2A). Although we could hardly distinguish SAEC from NHBE based on the
signature genes in single/specific cell subtype (Fig. S2B), we could clearly observe
that SAEC samples were significantly closer to distal airways, while NHBE samples
were nearer to proximal airway cells when grouping these cells according to the
locations (Fig. 1E). In summary, our data demonstrate the successful reconstitution of
the in vitro 3D airway ALI model with both upper and lower respiratory airway epithelial
cells.

The replication of coronaviruses in human upper and lower respiratory airways

We next characterized the replicative capacities of three human coronaviruses
SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E in human upper and lower respiratory
airway ALI models. SAEC and NHBE ALIs were infected with SARS-CoV-2 or HCoVOC43 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1, and infected with HCoV-229E at MOI
of 0.0001 to 0.01 from the apical side and the viral yield at the same side was
quantified at different time points post-infection. SARS-CoV-2 displayed a timedependent increase in viral titers and the peak titer was observed at 72 hours post
infection (hpi) in both NHBE and SAEC ALI. (Fig. 2A). The growth kinetics of SARSCoV-2 in these two models was indistinguishable. OC43 showed a similar growth
curve as SARS-CoV-2 in SAEC ALI. However, in NHBE ALI, no increase in viral yield
was observed (Fig. 2B), suggesting the replication of OC43 in NHBE ALI might be
abortive. Compared with SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43, 10 to 1000-fold less
inoculum of HCoV-229E was used because even at the MOI as low as 0.0001, severe
cytopathic effect was observed for SAEC ALI within 48 hrs. At all tested MOIs, HCoV229E viral production at the epithelial apical surface of SAEC ALI increased sharply
upon virus addition, reached the plateau at 48 hpi, and then declined rapidly (Fig. 2C
left panel, Fig. S3A), suggesting the replication of HCoV-229E in SAEC ALI.
Continuous increase of the virus titer was observed for all MOIs in NHBE ALI from day
1 to day 5 post infection (Fig. 2C right panel, Fig. S3B), with a peak viral titer similar
to that in SAEC ALI.
At the end of the experiment, ALI cultures were processed for H&E staining to
understand the morphology remodeling caused by these viral infections. The SARSCoV-2 infected SAEC ALI had dramatically less ciliated cells, reduced thickness (Fig.
2D, left panel), and non-observable cilia beating (data not shown). Interestingly, no
significant morphology changing was observed in NHBE ALI after SARS-CoV-2

infection (Fig. 2D, left panel), suggesting the host response in NHBE ALI might differ
from that in SAEC ALI. HCoV-229E showed very similar pathogenesis as SARS-CoV2 (Fig. 2E). Coincident with the rapid decline in viral titer, the HCoV-229E-infected
SAEC ALI had significantly less ciliated cells, reduced thickness, and a reduction in
TEER (Fig. 2E-F, Fig. S1B, S3C), and no obvious characteristic cytopathic effect was
found in NHBE ALI (Fig. 2E-F, Fig. S3C). The phenotypic differences in NHBE and
SAEC ALI epithelia pathology was not elicited by the viral load difference, because the
apical surface virus titer in NHBE ALI was even higher than that in SAEC ALI (Fig. 2C).
OC43 infection resulted in an opposite phenomenon that the epithelial integrity of
NHBEALI was damaged, but SAEC ALI was intact (Fig. 2D, right panel), which is well
in line with its viral replication kinetics in these two models (Fig. 2B).
Taken together, these data demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E could
efficiently replicate in both NHBE and SAEC ALI and produce infectious virions, and
HCoV-229E shares high degree of pathogenesis similarity with SARS-CoV-2 in both
upper and lower respiratory tract of human airway.

Coronavirus infection elicits differential cytokine profiles in upper and lower
respiratory airway
Next, we evaluated the production of a panel of 33 cytokines in both NHBE and
SAEC ALI infected by HCoV-229E for 24 hours to further understand the
pathophysiological differences between upper and lower respiratory airways. Upon
HCoV-229E infection, 18 cytokines were regulated, among which the number of
cytokines that are either upregulated or downregulated from the apical side were
remarkably less than the basal compartment in both NHBE and SAEC ALI (Table 1),
however most of the pro-inflammatory cytokines were up-regulated at apical whereas

8

down-regulated in the basal compartment (Table 1). These observations indicate the
cytokine release in respiratory tracts is polarized and the level of the proinflammatory
cytokines in the pulmonary side is much higher than the blood circulation at early time
of infection.
When all the upregulated cytokines from the apical side of NHBE and SAEC
ALI were analyzed side by side, we observed that a total of 8 cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-4,
IL-6, IL-9, IL21, IL22, LIF and TNF-ɑ). were upregulated in the apical side of SAEC
ALI after HCoV-229E infection in a MOI-dependent manner (Fig. 3A), however only 2
cytokines (IL-6 and IL21) were upregulated in NHBE ALI (Fig. 3B). These results are
consistent with cytokine analysis data from COVID-19 patients (Huang et al., 2020),
and demonstrate the HCoV-229E infection triggered an aggressive induction of
cellular immune response in SAEC but not in NHBE ALI, which is correlated with the
observation of the differential tissue damage caused by HCoV-229E infection in NHBE
and SAEC ALI. IL-6 appeared to be highly interesting as it was well known to play a
critical role in COVID-19 disease exacerbation. Its production at different time points
were further examined. Although its induction after HCoV-229E infection was
observable in both NHBE and SAEC ALI, the level of IL-6 in both the apical and basal
compartment in NHBE ALI was significantly lower when compared with SAEC ALI at
all time points and all MOIs (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, in HCoV-OC43 infected cultures,
a significantly higher level of IL-6 was also detected in SAEC ALI compared with NHBE
ALI (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data suggest the preferential induction of a more
“inflamed” microenvironment in the lower respiratory tract might be a common feature
of coronaviruses. It will be of interest to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection
induces similar immune signatures in NHBE and SAEC ALI cultures in the future.

HCoV-229E triggered differential transcriptional profile changes in upper and
lower respiratory airways
In order to understand if the coronavirus infection caused differential
transcriptional profile changes in upper and lower respiratory tracts, RNA sequencing
was performed with HCoV-229E -infected NHBE and SAEC ALI. ANPEP, the entry
receptor of HCoV-229E was found highly expressed in uninfected SAEC ALI but its
expression level decreased dramatically after HCoV-229E infection in a timedependent manner (Fig. 4A). This phenomenon is similar to ACE2 downregulation
after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Chung et al., 2020). ANPEP expression level was much
lower in uninfected NHBE ALI and did not change after HCoV-229E infection. Despite
of the low ANPEP expression level, the viral yield in NHBE ALI was comparable with
SAEC ALI (Fig. 2F), suggesting either a minimal level of ANPEP was sufficient for
HCoV-229E entry in both models or there is an alternative entry receptor expressed
on NHBE ALI to facilitate the virus entry. No statistically significant enrichment of IFNinducible genes or apoptosis-related pathways was observed between uninfected
NHBE and SAEC ALI (Fig. S2C), , indicating that in either uninfected NHBE or SAEC
ALI, the interferon signaling and apoptosis were not activated. Therefore, the different
histopathological changes of upper and lower respiratory airway after HCoV-229E
infection are likely due to the differential host responses resulted from the viral
infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection may adopt similar mechanism, considering it showed
similar pathology pattern with HCoV-229E (Fig. 2A, 2C-E).
To further characterize the different host responses induced by HCoV-229E in
the upper and lower respiratory tracts, we performed in-depth transcriptome analysis
of NHBE and SAEC ALI before and after the virus infection. As expected, compared
with the uninfected controls, the infected SAEC ALI showed a significant amount of

differential gene expression at all indicated time points, whereas differential gene
expression in infected NHBE ALI was sparse (Fig. 4B). Also, the abnormalities and
differentiation in the regulation of gene expression in NHBE ALI and SAEC ALI
occurred as early as 4 hpi (Fig. 4C). These analyses confirm that HCoV-229E infection
triggered more aggressive host response in SAEC ALI at very early time of infection.
We next classified these genes with differential expression between NHBE ALI and
SAEC ALI at 4 hpi into three groups (Fig. 4D) and profiled the log transformed
expression fold-changes of these groups using heatmaps (Fig. 4E). Differential gene
expression upregulation was more frequently observed in NHBE ALI compared with
SAEC ALI after virus infection (Fig. 4E). Additionally, the SAEC differential gene
expression maintained the same up- or down-regulated trends as in 4, 24 and 48 hpi
(Fig. 4E), suggesting that the distinct differential gene expression associated with viral
infection in upper and lower respiratory airway is probably very early induced, and may
persist during the infection process.
Furthermore, we conducted pathway enrichment analysis to reveal the
underlying biological functions of the differential expressed genes from group 1 and
group 3 (Fig. 4F). Intriguingly, majority of the top ranked pathways were directly
involved in the releasing or production of cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors in the
Th17 cells and macrophages. We also checked the intracellular RNA expression level
of cytokine/chemokine that were shown to be up-regulated in the apical side of SAEC
ALI after virus infection (Table 1, Fig. 4G), The fold change in intracellular RNA level
was consistent with the amount secreted into the apical compartment and may further
explain the reason why a more “inflamed” microenvironment exists in the lower
respiratory tract. Apart from IL-6, To sum up, core gene sets and functional pathways

that may contribute to the early immune responses during the infection of HCoV-229E
was similar as reported with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SAEC ALI represents a physiologically relevant model for the evaluation of anticoronavirus inhibitors
3D airway epithelial ALI model is well acknowledged as the most physiologically
in vitro model for the evaluation of direct antiviral reagents (Boda et al., 2018). NHBE
ALI has been employed to evaluate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase inhibitors Remdesivir (Pizzorno et al., 2020), EIDD-1931 (Sheahan
et al., 2020) and the main protease inhibitors (Fu et al., 2020; Vuong et al., 2020).
However, their efficacy in SAEC ALI was not reported yet. Because SARS-CoV-2 can
infect lower respiratory tract and trigger extensive epithelium damage and
inflammation in lower respiratory airway, causing life-threatening pneumonia in 14%
of case (Grasselli et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020a),
understanding of the efficacy of the anti-coronavirus drugs in coronavirus-infected
SAEC ALI is crucial.
The anti-HCoV-229E efficacy of the main protease inhibitor GC376 was
investigated in the SAEC ALI model. SAEC ALI was inoculated with HCoV-229E at an
MOI of 0.01, followed by the addition of GC376 to the basal compartment which mimics
intravenous drug administration. Viral replication was monitored through repeated
sampling and TCID50 titration on MRC-5 cells. Treatment with GC376 at the
concentration of 4 µM fully blocked the production of infectious viruses (Fig. 5A) and
protected the cells from HCoV-229E virus-caused cell death, as demonstrated by the
H&E staining of the intact epithelium at 72 hpi and cilia movement observation (Fig.
5B and Fig. S1C). Partial inhibition of the infectious virus production and the epithelium

damage was observed with the treatment of GC376 at 2 µM. To further evaluate the
potential of the combination treatment of coronavirus main protease inhibitor with RNA
polymerase inhibitor, SAEC ALI cultures infected with HCoV-229E were treated with
GC376 and Remdesivir simultaneously in the basal compartment. Although
Remdesivir was reported to have only modest protective effect from CPEs at 0.1 µM
in SAEC ALI (Zhu et al., 2021), combo of Remdesivir and GC376 resulted in sterilizing
additive effect (Fig. 5C-D). All these data validate SAEC ALI model for the investigation
of coronavirus infection and discovery of anti-coronavirus drugs.

Discussion
SARS-CoV-2-induced upper respiratory infection appears to cause mild or
moderate symptoms, similar to conventional human coronaviruses that are a major
cause of common colds. However, in the lower respiratory tract, COVID-19-related
severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine
storm syndrome challenged elderly individuals and those with comorbidities
(Heymann and Shindo, 2020). The putative intrinsic differences between upper and
lower airway epithelia during coronavirus infection may count for the phenotypic and
clinical distinction in patients. Regarding the low physiological and functional relevance
of monolayer epithelial culture to human airway during virus infection, increasing
number of airway infection studies have applied the ALI models (Jazaeri Farsani et al.,
2015; Stelzig et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2016). Besides the frequently used proximal
airway ALIs, we at the first time reconstituted the human small airway ALI and
characterized the pathophysiology and innate immune features induced by the
coronaviruses with the ultimate objective to provide insight in terms of putative
prognostic biomarkers and/or patient management. Our data indicate that in vitro

13

NHBE or SAEC ALI models maintain high physiological relevance with the in vivo
human respiratory airway tissues from proximal or distal part respectively. Also, the
coronavirus induced immune response observed in these upper and lower respiratory
airway models are similar to what has been reported in COVID-19 patients (Catanzaro
et al., 2020).
Hyperactive immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, with the
outcome of excessive release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, was shown to be
correlated with the high mortality and unfavorable prognosis of the COVID-19 patients
(Ragab et al., 2020). In this study, we report the first time that both SARS-CoV-2 and
HCoV-229E elicited pathophysiological and immune feature differences in human
upper and lower respiratory airway. It’s been reported that in patients with COVID-19,
there is upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood, including IL-6, TNF,
and IFN-γ (Gong et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020) and anti-IL6 antibody Tocilizumab
treatment in COVID-19 showed clinical benefits (Conti et al., 2020). In accordance
with these findings, we identified IL-6 associated pro-inflammatory pathways and
expression level of IL-6 were significantly higher in virus-infected lower respiratory
tract. Our findings that both SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E could induce epithelia
damage in the lower respiratory airway (Fig. 2D), is consistent with the reported lung
injury or ARDS associated with severe COVID-19 patients (Chen et al., 2020). and
excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines is considered to be one of the
major contributing factors (Del Valle et al., 2020).
Novel antiviral test in the high physiologically relevant preclinical model could
speed up the whole drug development progress for the COVID-19. Our data support
the SAEC ALI as a promising in vitro model for the coronaviruses drug evaluation as
it showed high physiology and immune feature similarity with severe COVID-19 cases.

Apart from coronaviruses, we also investigated other type of respiratory viruses’
infection in our model, including respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza
viruses, rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus (data not shown). None of them
showed similar pathophysiology effects of coronavirus, further indicating that this
NHBE/SAEC ALI model could be of importance for coronavirus pathogenesis
investigation.
Our data showed validated anti-viral efficacy with references compounds in
SAEC ALI model and suggested the combination possibility of the polymerase inhibitor
and the 3C-like protease inhibitor for the COVID-19 patients. Further investigation on
the drug permeability, epithelia immune cells co-culture of SAEC ALI can be
envisioned for deeper understanding of the coronavirus. In summary, a better
understanding of the molecular mechanisms contributing to the coronavirus
pathological differences may open new approaches for COVID-19 treatment.

models are stable for months and were usually used for virus infection and drug
discovery at week 6-8 to enable the reproducible data.
MucilAir™ and SmallAir™ culturing
AMucilAir™ and SmallAir™ were provided by Epithelix SARL (Geneva, Switzerland)
and cultured at the air–liquid interface (ALI) in MucilAir™ culture medium (EP04MM)
or SmallAir™ culture medium (EP65SA) (Epithelix Sàrl, Geneva, Switzerland), in 24well plates with 6.5-mm Transwell® inserts (cat #3470, Corning Incorporated,
Tweksbury, USA).
Cell lines
The human lung fibroblast MRC5 was purchased from ATCC (USA). Cells were
cultured in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (Cat. 30-2003, ATCC) supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, Hyclone, USA) and 1% pen/strep
(Invitrogen) at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Viruses and inoculation
Human coronavirus 229E (VR-740™) was purchased from ATCC. Coronavirus OC43
was provided by Epithelix Sàrl. Coronavirus SARS-COV-2 (French circulating strain)
was provided by Epithelix Sàrl and the study was performed in VirNext (BSL3 facilities).
Prior to infection, the apical side of the ALI, MucilAir™ or SmallAir™ cultures were
washed once with PBS (with Ca2+/Mg2+) and transferred to a new plate containing
culture medium. 100μL of 229E inoculum (MOI = 0.01, 0.001 or 0.0001), SARS-COV2 inoculum (MOI = 0.1) or OC43 inoculum (MOI = 0.1) was applied to the apical side
of the tissues for 1h at 37°C. Non-infected controls were exposed to 100 μl culture
medium on the apical side for 1 h. Viruses were eliminated after the incubation period
by two rapid PBS washing steps.

Apical washes with 300 μl of culture medium were performed for 10 min at indicated
days. RNA extracted from the apical washes with the QIAamp® Viral RNA kit (Qiagen)
was quantified with SuperScript™ III Platinum™ One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen)
by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) in Roche Light Cycler 480 (Roche). Primers and
probes used for 229E: forward primers 5′ TGG CAC AGG ACC CCA TAA AG 3′;
reverse primers 5′ CAA CCC AGA CGA CAC CTT CA 3′; Probe FAM 5’TGCAAAATTTAGAGAGCGTG-3’ BHQ. (Patent CN103993101A). Primers and
probes used for SARS-Cov-2: forward primer: 5’-TGGGGYTTTACRGGTAACCT-3’;
reverse

TAGTTGTGATGCWATCATGACTAG-TAMRA-3’. Primers and probes used for OC43:
forward primer: 5'-STC GAT CGG GAC CCA AGT AG-3'; reverse primer: 5′- CCT TCC
TGA GCC TTC AAT ATA GTA ACC-3′; Probe: 5′-FAM- AGG CTA TTC CGA CTA
GGT TTC CGC CTG-TAMRA-3’.
Cell culture-based titration
Viral titers of the 229E samples were determined as log10TCID50/ml. Confluent
monolayers of MRC5 cells were inoculated in duplicates with 10-fold serial dilutions of
the apical wash samples and were placed at 34 °C for 3 days. Cell viability was
determined using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) kit (Dojindo, Cat.CK04) and an
Envision reader (PE) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER)
300 μl of culture medium was added to the apical compartment of the tissue cultures,
resistance was measured across cultures with an EVOM2 volt-ohm-meter (World
Precision Instruments, Sarasota, US). Resistance values (Ω) were converted to TEER
(Ω*cm2) by using the following formula: TEER (Ω*cm2) = (resistance value (Ω) -

100(Ω)) x 0.33 (cm2), where 100 Ω is the resistance of the membrane and 0.33 cm 2 is
the total surface of the epithelium of 24-well plate.
H&E stain
ALI tissues were fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde Fix Solution (#AR1068, Boster) at
indicated time points overnight, followed by embedded to paraffin blocks. The paraffinembedded tissue blocks were sectioned at 5 µm thickness on a microtome and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin.
Cytokine profiling
Apical wash and basal medium from infected ALI samples at indicated time points
were measured for the cytokine production by Immune Monitoring 65-Plex Human
ProcartaPlex™ Panel (#EPX650-10065-901) with The Luminex® 100/200™ System.
RNA sample preparation and sequencing
Total RNA from ALI, MucilAir™ or SmallAir™ were extracted using Trizol LS (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 1 μg total RNA with RIN
value above 6.5 was used for library preparation. Libraries with different indices were
multiplexed and loaded on an Illumina HiSeq instrument according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The sequences were processed and
analyzed by GENEWIZ.
RNAseq analysis
Paired-end RNASeq reads were mapped to the human genome (hg38) with STAR
aligner version 2.5.2a using default mapping parameters (Dobin et al., 2013). The
unmapped reads were later aligned to HCoV-229E genome using bowtie2 (v2.3.5) in
sensitive mode (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). Numbers of mapped reads for all
RefSeq transcript variants of a gene (counts) were combined into a single value by
featureCounts software (Dobin et al., 2013; Liao et al., 2014) and normalized as tpm

(transcripts per million). Differentially expressed genes were identified with edgeR
(v3.32.1) at a fold-change >2 and aveExpr >2.(Robinson et al., 2010)
Gene set enrichment analysis
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using R package fgsea
(v1.16.0) (Korotkevich et al., 2021). Gene list was ranked by logFC (NHBE compared
to SAEC) in descending order. Normalized enrichment score (NES) was calculated
with the internalized Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB), MetaBase, and
ImmuneSpace signatures.
BioQC analysis
Quality control based on the enrichment of lung tissue gene signatures was performed
with BioQC (v1.19.3) (Zhang et al., 2017). The BioQC scores used for visualization
are log10-transformed one-sided p-values of Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. The
clustering and annotation of lung tissue cell types were obtained from published
articles (Deprez et al., 2020 and Travaglini et al., 2020).
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. For statistical comparison
one-way or two-way analysis of variance were performed with multiple comparison
tests using GraphPad Prims software (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p <
0.0001).

panel represents the differential gene expression of infected NHBE models compared
to uninfected controls at 4h, 24h and 48h. The x-axis is Log2 fold-change of each gene.
The y-axis shows the -log10(p-value). C, Volcano plots depict the differential gene
expression in NHBE versus SAEC models before (CT) and after virus infection (4h,
24h and 48h). D, Venn diagrams illustrate the overlapping genes before and after virus
infection that regulated in NHBE compared to SAEC models. E, Heatmaps describe
the log(fold-changes) of genes derived from three groups marked in Fig 4D. Red and
blue indicate high and low fold-changes respectively. F, Dot plot describes enriched
pathways of the 2719 strongly regulated genes in NHBE models compared to SAEC
at 4h infection. These genes were derived from group 1 and 3 that marked in Fig 4D.
The x-axis is the normalized enrichment score for each gene set and the y-axis is –

epithelium integrity in 3D airway epithelial ALI model
A, SAEC ALI cultures were infected with 229E at MOI 0.0001 followed by the treatment
of GC376. Apical viral production was assessed in washes of the apical pole at Day 2.
MRC5 cells were incubated with serial dilutions of the collected sample for the
determination of viral titers. Dotted line indicates the TCID50/mL. B, H&E staining of
the Fig. 6A. C, SAEC ALI cultures were infected with 229E at MOI 0.0001 followed by
the treatment of combo of GC376 and Remdesivir. Apical viral production was
assessed in washes of the apical pole at Day 2. MRC5 cells were incubated with serial
dilutions of the collected sample for the determination of viral titers. D, H&E staining
of the ALI cultures from Fig 6C. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments.
