Abstract
The molecular basis for the severity and rapid spread of the COVID-19 disease caused by SARSCoV-2 is largely unknown. ORF8 is a rapidly evolving accessory protein that has been proposed to
interfere with immune responses. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 was determined at
2.04 Å resolution by x-ray crystallography. The structure reveals a ~60 residue core similar to
SARS-CoV ORF7a with the addition of two dimerization interfaces unique to SARS-CoV-2
ORF8. A covalent disulfide-linked dimer is formed through an N-terminal sequence specific to
SARS-CoV-2, while a separate non-covalent interface is formed by another SARS-CoV-2-specific
sequence, 73YIDI76. Together the presence of these interfaces shows how SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 can
form unique large-scale assemblies not possible for SARS-CoV, potentially mediating unique
immune suppression and evasion activities.

The severity of the current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 relative to past
outbreaks of MERS, SARS, and other betacoronaviruses, in humans begs the question as to its
molecular basis. The accessory protein ORF8 is one of the most rapidly evolving betacoronavirus
proteins (1-7). While ORF8 expression is not strictly essential for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
replication, a 29 nucleotide deletion (Δ29) that occurred early in human to human transmission of
SARS-CoV, splitting ORF8 into ORF8a and 8b, is correlated with milder disease (8). A 382
nucleotide deletion (Δ382) in SARS-CoV-2 (9, 10) was also found to correlate with milder disease
and a lower incidence of hypoxia (11).
SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a 121 amino acid protein consisting of an N-terminal signal sequence
followed by a predicted Ig-like fold (12). With <20% sequence identity to SARS-CoV ORF8,
SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is remarkably divergent. ORF8 proteins from both viruses possess a signal
sequence for ER import. Within the lumen of the ER, SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 interacts with a variety
of host proteins, including many factors involved in ERAD (13). Presumably, ORF8 is secreted,
rather than retained in the ER, since ORF8 antibodies are one of the principal markers of SARSCoV-2 infections (14). Several functions have been proposed for SARS-CoV-2 ORF8. ORF8
disrupts IFN-I signaling when exogenously overexpressed in cells (15). It has been shown that
ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2, but not ORF8 or ORF8a/b of SARS-CoV, downregulates MHC-I in cells
(16).
These observations suggest the relationship between ORF8 structure, function, and sequence
variation may be pivotal for understanding the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as a deadly human
pathogen. Yet not only is there no three-dimensional structure of any ORF8 protein from any
coronavirus, there are no homologs of known structure with sequence identity sufficient for a
reliable alignment. SARS and SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a are the most closely related templates of
known structure(17), yet its core is approximately half the size of ORF8 and its primary sequence
identity is negligible. Therefore, we determined the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8. The
structure confirms the expected Ig-like fold and overall similarity of the core fold to SARS-CoV
ORF7a. The structure reveals two novel dimer interfaces for SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 unique relative
to all but its most recent ancestors in bats. Together, our results set the foundation for elucidating
essential aspects of ORF8 biology to be leveraged for the development of novel therapeutics.
We generated SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein by expression in E. coli and oxidative refolding. The
structure of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 was determined by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 2.04
Å (Fig. 1A, B). Side-chain density was visible throughout most of the density map and an atomic
model was built ab initio into the density (Fig. 1C). ORF8 crystallized as a covalent dimer with 3
sets of intramolecular disulfide bonds per monomer and a single intermolecular disulfide bond
formed by Cys20 of each monomer (Fig. 1B). The core of each ORF8 monomer consists of a two
antiparallel β-sheets (Fig. 1D, 1E). The smaller sheet consists of β2 and β5, while the larger is
formed from the remaining five β-strands (Fig. 1D, 1E).
ORF8 has a 14% sequence identity with the SARS-CoV ORF7a protein. The Ig-like fold of
ORF7a (PDB:1XAK) aligns with the ORF8 monomer with a DALI Z-score=4.6 and an
RMSD=2.4 (Fig. 2B). Based on the structural alignment, ORF8 and ORF7a share two sets of
structural disulfide linkages that are central to the Ig-like fold (Fig 2A, C). Punctuated between
what would be β3 and β5 of ORF7a is a ORF8-specific region of ~35AA from residues 46-83 that

are structurally distinct from ORF7a and other Ig-like folds (Fig. 2A, B, D). These residues are
responsible for a third, ORF8-specific, disulfide (Fig 2A, C).
SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 separates into two distinct species when analyzed by size exclusion
chromatography. Comparison of the elution peak volumes with molecular weight standards
suggest dimeric and monomeric forms (Fig. 3A). The asymmetric unit within the crystal contains
the dimeric form (Fig. 3B) and exhibits imperfect two-fold non-crystallographic symmetry. The
dimer is linked by an intermolecular disulfide bridge formed between two copies of Cys20 (Fig.
3B). Generation of the surface electrostatic potential for each monomer shows the interfaces are
complementary (Fig. 3B). The dimeric interface amounts to approximately 1320 Å2 in buried
surface area (18). The intermolecular bonds are primarily contributed by β1 and β7 residues and
the loop joining β3 and β4 (Fig. 3C-D). The intermolecular disulfide bridge orchestrates the noncrystallographic symmetry axis (Fig. 3C). Val117 forms a hydrophobic interaction with its
symmetry-related counterpart. This central hydrophobic region is flanked by salt bridges between
Arg115 and Asp119 (Fig. 3C). The ends of the interface are stabilized by a “clamp” loop which
makes main-chain hydrogen bonding interactions between Phe120 of one subunit and Ala51 and
Arg52 of the other (Fig. 3D). The guanidino group of Arg52 in turn reaches across and forms a
hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of the Ile121 main-chain. An additional hydrogen-bond is
formed between ε-amino group of Lys53 and Ser24. These features are near-identical on the
opposite side of the interface, owing to the symmetry of the dimer.
Sequence alignment of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 and its closely related bat betacoronavirus RaTG13
and SL-CoVZC45 orthologs revealed the six Cys forming intramolecular disulfide bridges are all
conserved. These Cys are also conserved in SARS-CoV and most of its relatives (Fig. 4), and are
also present in the corresponding regions of SARS-CoV ORF8a and b. However, Cys20, is not
conserved in SARS-CoV ORF8 and bat viruses clustering phylogenetically with human SARSCoV (Fig. 4). The residues immediately surrounding Cys20 are also conserved in the most recent
bat precursors of SARS-CoV-2. The features thus required for the overall fold of the ORF8
monomer are well-preserved across SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and related betacoronavirus. The
covalent dimer, is, however, an evolutionarily recent addition among human betacoronaviruses
unique to SARS-CoV-2.
Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains revealed two predominant isoforms of ORF8 in
circulation, containing either Leu84 and Ser84 (4, 7). The structure reported here is of the Leu84
form. In the ORF8 structure, residue Leu84 is flanked by the disulfide-forming Cys83 on one side
and by Pro85 on the other (Fig. 1C). Pro85 adopts the unusual cis-conformation. Both Cys83 and
Pro85 are conserved amongst ORF8 orthologs. Given the position of Leu84, with its solvent
exposed side-chain, it seems unlikely mutation would influence overall tertiary structure. Leu84 is
also distal to both novel SARS-CoV-2-specific dimer interfaces. The biological role of residue 84
remains to be determined, but its unusual positioning controlled by a disulfide and cis-Pro together
suggests its likely role in function.
Another major region of sequence unique to SARS-CoV-2 and its closest relatives begins
immediately after Cys 61 and extends until just before the Cys83-Leu84-Pro85 conserved motif. A
SARS-CoV-2-specific 73YIDI76 motif occurs at the center of this unique region. The YIDI motif is
responsible for stabilizing an extensive non-covalent dimer interface in the crystal, scored as
highly significant (18) on the basis of its 1,700 Å2 of buried surface area and hydrophobicity. This
suggests the non-covalent dimer seen in the crystal is a special feature of SARS-CoV-2 absent in
SARS-CoV. The combination of Leu95, Ile58, Val49, and Pro56 form a hydrophobic interaction

with Tyr73 of the YIDI motif (Fig 5C, 5D). Crystallographic contacts revealed an extensive array
of hydrophobic interactions between residues 71-75 of chain A that interdigitate with the
corresponding residues of a symmetry-related copy of chain B, distinct from the B-subunit of the
covalent dimer (Fig 5E, 5F). The center of the interface comprises a two-stranded parallel β-sheet
that is distinct from the core β-sheets of the monomeric Ig fold. Taken in combination with the
Cys20-mediated covalent dimer interface, the structure shows two sequence regions unique to
SARS-CoV-2 control the oligomerization and crystal packing of ORF8, and potentially mediate
higher-order macromolecular assemblies unique to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 5G). These observations
show how recent evolutionary changes in the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 relative to its more benign
precursors could contribute to a unique higher-order assembly mediating unique functions in
immune evasion and suppression.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression and purification
The gene for wild-type SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 18-121 was subcloned from a cDNA kindly provided
by D. Gordon and N. Krogan (UCSF) into the pET His6 TEV LIC cloning vector (2B-T). The
plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) Rosetta pLysS (QB3 MacroLab, UC
Berkeley), then expressed overnight (0.5 mM IPTG) at 20 °C in Luria Broth (LB) containing
ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris
pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% Triton-X100) supplemented with protease
inhibitors (Roche) and lysed by sonication. Lysate was clarified by centrifugation and the pellet
washed with lysis buffer and sonicated for an additional 10 minutes to homogenize. Suspension
was again clarified by centrifugation, the pellet resuspended in solubilization buffer (100 mM Tris
pH 8.5, 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 10 mM reduced glutathione) followed by Dounce
homogenization and incubated at room temperature with rocking for 1 hour. Insoluble particulates
were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant applied to nickel-charged agarose (GE
Healthcare) preequilibrated in solubilization buffer. The resin was washed with solubilization
buffer and bound His-tagged ORF8 eluted with elution buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8.5, 6 M
guanidine hydrochloride, 10 mM reduced glutathione, 350 mM imidazole). Solubilized ORF8 was
added drop-wise to a 50 fold excess of cold refolding buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM Larginine, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM reduced glutathione, 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione, 0.2 mM PMSF)
over a period of 2 hours with gentle stirring followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. The
refolding solution was filtered, concentrated and applied to a Superdex S75 size-exclusion column
equilibrated in buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Folded ORF8
eluted as two peaks corresponding to monomer and dimer. Both peaks were pooled and incubated
with TEV protease overnight. Cleavage products were passed through nickel-charged agarose (GE
Healthcare) to remove any uncleaved ORF8. The flow-through was concentrated and applied to a
Superdex S75 size-exclusion column equilibrated in buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Both monomer and dimer peaks were pooled and concentrated.
The plasmid containing the ORF8 V32M, L84M double mutant coding sequence was generated by
QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent).
Selenomethionine labeled ORF8 double mutant protein was expressed using SelenoMet Medium
Base according to manufacturer’s instructions (Molecular dimensions). Purification was carried
out in the same manner as wild-type but the TEV-cleavage step was omitted.
The expression construct has been made available at addgene.org.

X-ray crystallography
Crystals of wild-type ORF8 were grown using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at 18 °C.
2 µl of the protein sample (7.8 mg ml-1) was mixed with 2 µl of reservoir solution and suspended
over a 500-µl reservoir of 100 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate pH 6.5, 12 % (w/v) PEG8000.
Crystals appeared after 5 days and continued to grow for approximately one week. Crystals were
transferred into cryoprotectant (100 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate pH 6.5, 12 % (w/v)
PEG8000, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 30 % (v/v) glycerol) and flash-frozen
by plunging into liquid nitrogen. A native dataset was collected from a single crystal of space
group P41212 under cryogenic conditions (100 K) at a wavelength of 1.00001 Å using a Dectris

Pilatus3 S 6M detector (Beamline 5.0.2, Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory).
Crystals of selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled V32M/L84M ORF8 were produced using the same
reservoir condition as wild-type and a lower concentration of protein (2.5 mg ml-1). Crystals
exhibiting a different morphology to wild-type appeared after 2 days and continued to grow for
approximately 4 days. A single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) selenium peak dataset in
space group I4122 was collected at a wavelength of 0.97903 Å.
The diffraction data were indexed and integrated using XDS (19). Integrated reflections were
scaled, merged and truncated using the CCP4 software suit (20). Initial phases were obtained for
the SeMet dataset using the Phenix autosol pipeline (21). This solution led to a map that enabled
the full ORF8 main-chain to be traced which was partially refined and in then used as a search
model for molecular replacement with respect to the native dataset using PHASER (22). The space
group of the native dataset is P41212 with one ORF8 dimer in the asymmetric unit. Iterative rounds
of manual model building and refinement were carried out using Coot (23) and Phenix Refine (21)
respectively. Statistics of the final native structure are shown in Table 1. Structural figures were
produced using the program PyMOL (https://pymol.org).
Sequence alignment
Primary sequences of ORF8 and ORF7 from human and bat isolates were collected from
GenBank. Sequences used for alignment were selected based on previous phylogenetic analyses
(12). Primary sequence alignment of ORF8 homologs was performed using the ClustalOmega
server (24). Sequence alignment of ORF7a and ORF8 and secondary structure annotations were
guided by DSSP through the DALI server (25)and manually adjusted based on visual inspection of
the structures.
