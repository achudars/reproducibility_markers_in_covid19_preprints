Abstract
Small molecule inhibitors have previously been investigated in different studies as possible therapeutics in
the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. In the current drug repurposing study, we identified the leukotriene (D4)
receptor antagonist Montelukast as a novel agent that simultaneously targets two important drug targets of
SARS-CoV-2. We initially demonstrated the dual inhibition profile of Montelukast through multiscale
molecular modeling studies. Next, we characterized its effect on both targets by different in vitro
experiments including the Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based main protease enzyme
inhibition assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, pseudovirus neutralization on HEK293T
/ hACE2, and virus neutralization assay using xCELLigence MP real time cell analyzer. Our integrated in
silico and in vitro results confirmed the dual potential effect of the Montelukast both on virus entry into the
host cell (Spike/ACE2) and on the main protease enzyme inhibition. The virus neutralization assay results
showed that while no cytotoxicity of the Montelukast was observed at 12 µM concentration, the cell index
time 50 (CIT50) value was delayed for 12 hours. Moreover, it was also shown that Favipiravir, a well-known
antiviral used in COVID-19 therapy, should be used by 16-fold higher concentrations than Montelukast in
order to have the same effect of Montelukast. The rapid use of new small molecules in the pandemic is very
important today. Montelukast, whose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties are very well
characterized and has been widely used in the treatment of asthma since 1998, should urgently be completed
in clinical phase studies and if its effect is proven in clinical phase studies, it should be used against COVID19.

1. Introduction
The 2019 new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan (Hubei,
China). It has quickly spread to other countries all around the world and effected more than 67
million people worldwide becoming an urgent global pandemic. Coronaviruses are enveloped,
non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the family of Coronaviridae, the largest
family in Nidovirales and widely distributed in humans, other mammals and birds, causing
respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological diseases. Seven species of coronavirus are known to
cause disease in humans. Four of them (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) are common and they
mostly cause common cold symptoms in immunocompetent individuals while the other three,
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARSCoV-2 cause serious symptoms and death.1 In addition to the
common cold symptoms, SARS-COV-2 shows many clinical signs including severe pneumonia,
clot formation RNAaemia and the incidence of endothelitis, fatigue, neurological and cardiac
consequences.2
All coronaviruses have specific genes in ORF1 downstreams that encode proteins for viral
replication, nucleocapsid and spikes development.3 SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins
which are nucleocapsid, envelope, membrane and spike. These four proteins play a vital role
during the viral infection.4 The Spike glycoprotein (S protein) located on the external surface of
coronaviruses are responsible for the connection and entry of the virus to host cells.1 The S protein
mediates receptor recognition, cell attachment, and fusion during viral infection. While the virus
is in its natural environment, S protein of coronavirus is inactive. During viral infection, target cell
proteases activate the S protein by cleaving it into S1 and S2 subunits, which are required to
activate the membrane fusion domain after viral entry into target cells.5 The S1 subunit includes
the receptor binding domain (RBD). This domain binds directly to the peptidase domain
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). S2 functions during membrane fusion.
The chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease called 3C-like protease (3CLpro) aka main protease
(Mpro) in SARS-CoV-2 is a vital enzyme involved in processes such as the processing, assembly,
and replication of the virus. Thus, Mpro is one of the ideal targets for drug design and development
studies against SARS-CoV-2.6

One of the key characteristics of severe COVID-19 is increased cytokine production. It is thought
that the severity of the disease is primarily associated with the cytokine storm, which is an
aggressive immune response to the virus.7 The number of white blood cells, neutrophils, and levels
of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and other inflammatory indices like IL2, IL7, IL10,
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GSCF), interferon inducible protein -10 (IP10), monocyte
chemotactic protein-1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP1A), and TNF are
significantly higher in severe cases in patients with COVID-19.8,9 Specifically, IL-1β, IL-6, and
IL-10 are the three most elevated cytokines in serious cases.10,11 One result of the cytokine storm
is lung injury that can develop into acute lung injury or its more severe type (acute respiratory
distress syndrome, ARDS).
Studies have shown the relation between COVID-19 and the most common chronic conditions
such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory system diseases, immune system disorders,
etc.7,12 Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are among the diseases of the
respiratory system that are most emphasized. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway condition.
There is significant evidence that represents the relation of asthmatic patients in the population
with viral infections like rhinoviruses.13-15 Virus infections cause upper respiratory tract infection,
like influenza A, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) elevate local leukotriene
levels.16 Leukotrienes, which play a role in the contraction of bronchial muscles, are effective in
initiating and amplifying many biological responses, including mast cell cytokine secretion,
macrophage activation, and dendritic cell maturation and migration. Leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4
and LTE4), activated basophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and products of mast cells are types of
lipids conjugated with peptides.17
LTD4 receptors belong to G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Montelukast is a selective
leukotriene (D4) receptor antagonist which is a member of quinolines and it was approved by FDA
as an oral tablet in 1998. It is a licensed drug used for allergic rhinitis, exercise-induced
bronchospasm and especially prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma. As a result of LTD4
blockage, NF-kB pathway activation and release of the proinflammatory mediators (i.e., IL-6,8
and 10, TNF-a and MCP-1) decrease3. Considering these anti-inflammatory effects by leukotriene
receptor inhibition and possible antiviral effects, Montelukast may be considered for the effective

medication against SARS CoV-2.18,19 Some studies claim that Montelukast may play an
immunomodulatory role as a leukotriene receptor inhibitor in treatment since one of the
pathophysiological steps of severe COVID-19 cases is the cytokine storm resulting from excessive
proinflammatory mediator releasing.20,21
Nowadays the concept of drug repurposing is an evolving technique in which approved drugs are
commonly used to identify potential candidates for different diseases. Developing new drugs from
scratch is a long process and thus impractical to cope with the current global challenge.22 Many
drugs have several protein targets, and many diseases share molecular mechanisms that overlap
each other. In this scenario, reusing drugs for new purposes and discovering their new uses by
using computational approaches will dramatically lower the cost, time and risks of the drug
development processes.23
Here, initially we explored the potential role of Montelukast in the management of SARS-CoV-2
infection with multiscale molecular modeling approaches and its promising results both in main
protease and Spike/ACE2 interface encouraged us to perform further detailed in vitro experiments.
The results of FRET-based biochemical assays, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), pseudovirus
neutralization and virus neutralization experiments demonstrated the effect of Montelukast on
SARS-CoV-2.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1 In Silico Drug Repurposing studies suggest usage of Montelukast against SARS-CoV-2
It has been recognized that the "single target-one molecule" approach is not very effective in treating
complex diseases and alternative combination drugs are not appreciated due to toxicity and / or
unwanted drug-drug interactions.24,40 The promising approach to these complex diseases is to develop
single-multitarget compounds that a molecule may interact with multiple related selected target
proteins simultaneously. As new drugs are expensive and time consuming to develop, repositioning /
reusing drugs has emerged as an alternative approach. Thus, in our recent study24 we have screened
FDA approved drugs and compounds in clinical investigation to identify effective single-multi-target

molecules against HIV-1. For this aim, two important and essential proteins in the HIV-1 life cycle,
CCR5 co-receptor (belongs to GPCR family) and HIV-1 protease (PR) enzyme, were targeted and
about 25 potential hit compounds were identified. Montelukast was among the molecules we
suggested as dual HIV-1 inhibitor with in silico simulations and that we purchased and added to our
molecule library to evaluate in silico results. When Montelukast achieved successful results against
SARS-CoV-2 main protease and Spike/ACE-2 targets in the preliminary virtual screening studies of
our small molecule library belonging to our laboratory, we decided to carry it to further experimental
studies.
Both noncovalent and covalent docking approaches are performed in the SARS-CoV-2 main protease
since recent structural biology studies show that majority of the co-crystallized compounds at the main
protease construct bonded interactions. Top-docking poses of Montelukast at the main protease and
Spike/ACE2 targets were then used in 1 µsec all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Figure
1 shows representative structure of Montelukast at the SARS-CoV-2 main protease target obtained
from saved trajectories throughout the MD simulations initiated from non-covalent docking. Crucial
residues in ligand interaction were found as His41, Met49, Asn142, Met165, Glu166, Leu167, Pro168,
Phe185, Gln189 and Ala191 (Figure 2). In Figure 3, surface representation of representative complex
structure of Montelukast with main protease show crucial interactions. Corresponding interactions
obtained from simulations initiated from covalent docking were Asn142, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145,
His164, Glu166, and Gln189 (Figure 4).
The effect of Montelukast on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike/ACE-2 region is also investigated. Top-docking
pose of Montelukast at the Spike/ACE-2 is used at the all-atom MD simulations. Figures 5 and 6
represent 3D and 2D ligand interaction diagrams. The important residues in ligand interactions were
found as Lys26, Asp30, Val93, Pro389, Arg408, Lys417, Phe555, Asn556, and Arg559.
The binding energies of Montelukast at the main protease and Spike/ACE2 targets were also
investigated. Average MM/GBSA binding energy of Montelukast at the binding cavity of main
protease was measured as -79.60 ±8.66 kcal/mol. When we increased the simulation time (i.e.,
simulations are repeated with 3-fold), 3 µsec simulations also showed that Montelukast maintains its
interactions with the crucial residues at the binding pocket of Mpro. Average MM/GBSA binding

energy was calculated as -84.86 ±9.22 kcal/mol. The corresponding average MM/GBSA value of
Montelukast at the Spike/ACE-2 was calculated as -43.93±7.66 kcal/mol. (Figure 7)
2.2 Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based main protease enzyme
inhibition assay shows 74% loss of enzyme activity when using 100 µM Montelukast
The main protease assay revealed that the Montelukast molecule inhibits the main protease enzyme
activity in concentration dependent manner. The maximum inhibitory concentration was 100 µM
and inhibited the enzyme activity by 74.04%. At 50 µM concentration inhibition the enzyme
activity inhibition was 60.59%. (Figure 8) GC376 is a broad-spectrum antiviral which is used as a
positive control molecule at the used assay and it showed 88.59% enzyme activity inhibition at
100 µM. Nonlinear regression analysis of five different concentrations revealed that 50%
inhibition concentration (IC50) of Montelukast molecule is 28.36 µM (Figure 8). Experiments are
repeated by 6-times in IC50 measurement.
2.3 The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays demonstrate Montelukast binding to SARSCoV-2 main protease
In the present study, together with FRET-based binding analyses of Montelukast at the SARSCoV-2 main protease, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy was also used to evaluate
the binding kinetics and affinity of this interaction. Biosensor technology from SPR has become
an important tool for drug design and discovery. SPR techniques are used for a broad range of
applications including assessing the binding kinetics and affinity of an interaction, specificity tests,
ligand screening, as well as analyte active binding concentration measurements. It can be used for
the aim of drug screening for several diseases including COVID-19. Here, SPR was used to
estimate the potential role of Montelukast in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its
binding kinetics on main protease after analysis of multiscale molecular modeling studies and
FRET-based main protease enzyme inhibition assays.
Solvent correction for 9.2% DMSO was shown in Figure 9. The affinity of Montelukast to
immobilized Mpro was determined using a 1:1 steady-state binding affinity interaction model. A

concentration series ranging from 900 µM to 11 µM (3-fold dilution) was injected over
immobilized Mpro for 60 sec followed by a 120 sec dissociation phase. The responses obtained
from each Montelukast concentration were plotted against concentration using the Biacore T200
evaluation software and was evaluated using a 1:1 steady-state binding model. Montelukast was
identified as a specific binder to main protease (Figure 9). Its KD value was measured as 23.5 µM
which fits well with the FRET-based determined IC50 value. Squared-shape of sensorgrams shows
that both Montelukast binding to MPro and complex dissociation are fast processes. This kind of
binding behaviour is, however, relatively common for small molecules.
The observed concentration-dependent binding responses, from the preliminary results, indicate
that Montelukast molecule interacts with main protease with an affinity in the micro-molar range.
According to the sensorgrams, the interactions do not reach a plateau (equilibrium phase) and also
the small decrease of the sensorgrams at the end of the binding phase indicate that some
aggregation issue might be present. Therefore, the determination of the exact binding affinity
constant of the Montelukast to main protease is restrained.
2.4. Neutralization potential of Montelukast against SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by
pseudovirus neutralization on HEK293T/hACE2
Cell Viability. To investigate the dose-response relationship of Montelukast using the cell lines of
HEK293T, Vero E6, Calu-3, and A549, the cell viability was measured upon 24, 48, and 72 hr
exposure periods by MTT calorimetric assay. As shown in the Figure 10, HEK293T cell
monolayer was found to be the most sensitive cell line across the Montelukast exposure and
followed by the Vero E6, A549 and Calu-3. After 24, 48, and 72 hrs exposure periods, the IC50
value of Montelukast toward the used cell lines were given in the Table 1. The result of the cell
viability assay allows us to determine the concentration ranges for the pseudovirus neutralization
assay.
Pseudovirus neutralization. Pseudovirus neutralization on HEK293T/hACE2 was performed
using Montelukast at the concentration ranges of 1 to 50 µM (Figure 11). Inhibition of entry of
HEK293T/hACE2 cells were pretreated with Montelukast and transduced with SARS-CoV-2 S
pseudovirion. To evaluate the cell viability at the same concentrations which were used for
neutralization, the luciferase activity was measured 72 hr post transduction by CellTiter-Glo

Luminescent Cell Viability Assay Kit (Figure 11A). The entry efficiency of SARS-CoV-2
pseudoviruses without any treatment was taken as 100%. The representative plug formations at
different concentrations was shown in the photos which were taken with magnification 10X during
neutralization period (Figure 11B). The 50% effective neutralization concentration of Montelukast
was found as 54.04 µM, therefore the neutralization potential of montelukast against SARS-CoV2 was confirmed.
Pseudoviruses are useful tools due to especially for emerging and re-emerging viruses, their safety
and versatility. To increase the transfection and infection potency in the development stage of the
pseudovirus, the main factors including selection of plasmids, cell types, cell numbers, virus
inoculum needs to be optimized. In this study, pseudovirus neutralization assay was developed for
screening computationally selected drug, Montelukast, as potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main
protease.
2.5. Virus Neutralization Assay Using xCELLigence MP Real Time Cell Analyzer Demonstrates
the Effective Virus Neutralization Concentration of Montelukast
Neutralization assay was performed based on impedance using xCELLigence MP real time cell
analyzer equipment (RTCA). VERO E6 cells were used. Neutralization assay was performed
based on impedance (resistance to alternating current) using xCELLigence MP RTCA. The
impedance is expressed as arbitrary units called cell index (CI). Real-time cell analysis result of
Montelukast without virus incubation during the 150 hours shows that Montelukast can be used
up to 23 µM without cytotoxic effects (Figure 12) Figure 13 shows real-time cell analysis result
of Montelukast with the SARS-CoV-2. Data was collected for 150 hours with intervals of 15 min.
Results show that compound demonstrates neutralization effect at 12 µM. In this concentration, it
is not cytotoxic. The cell index time 50 (CIT50) is the time required for the CI to decrease by 50%
after virus infection. While no cytotoxicity of the molecule was observed at 12 µM concentration,
the CIT50 value was delayed for 12 hours. (Figure 14) When the same experiment is carried out
for the Favipiravir with same conditions, which is the one of the mostly used antiviral at the
COVID-19, we observed that Favipiravir should be used in 16-fold more higher doses than

Montelukast in order to show the same effect (i.e., around 12 hours delay in CIT50), (Figures 15
and 16).
The investigation of anti-viral activity and pseudovirus and virus neutralization potential
therapeutic agents against the live SARS-CoV-2 has to be performed under biosafety level 3
conditions because of its high pathogenicity and infectivity.25,26 Thus, in the current study, our
integrated in silico and combined in vitro experiments show the effect of Montelukast at the SARSCoV-2.
3. Methods
3.1. Molecular Modeling Studies
Before the molecular docking and MD simulations, both ligand structure and used target protein
structures

were

prepared.

Montelukast

structure

was

downloaded

from

PubChem

(https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and LigPrep module of the Maestro molecular modeling
package was used in ligand preparation with OPLS3e force field. Epik was used in the
determination of the protonation states at neutral pH.27 While the crystal structure of main protease
which is recently solved by our research group (PDB, 7CWB) in near physiological temperature
28

was used in docking and MD simulations, 6M0J coded structure was used in drug docking and

all-atom MD simulations for Spike/ACE-2 region. Protein preparation tool of Maestro was used
in both targets at physiological pH. Bond orders are assigned, and hydrogens were added. Disulfide
bonds were created and missing side chains were fixed using Prime.29 Water molecules beyond 5
Å from hetero groups were removed. PROPKA was used in the protonation states of the residues.
OPLS3e force field 30 was used in the restrain minimization with heavy atom convergence of 0.3
Å.
3.1.1 Noncovalent docking
The prepared target proteins and ligand structure were used for molecular docking simulations.
We performed a grid-based docking method (Glide/SP) at the docking.31 Binding site of the main
protease was defined by centering grids at the centroid of a set of three crucial residues in ligand
binding, namely His41, Cys145, and Glu166. Ali and Vijayan32 stated a very strong and sustained
salt bridge interactions between Lys417 of SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD and Asp30 of ACE-2. Thus,

the corresponding residues at the Spike/ACE-2 were used in grid generation. Top-docking poses
obtained from noncovalent docking are used in all-atom MD simulations.
3.1.2. Covalent docking
When the ligand forms a covalent bond with a binding pocket residue, the binding energy of the
ligand is not only from the construction of a covalent bond but also from stabilizing nonbonding
interactions. Here, we used Covalent Docking module from Maestro which selects the top-covalent
bond poses using Prime energy model.33 In this method, docking starts with Glide docking with
the reactive residue trimmed to Alanine residue. The reactive residue of the target protein is then
added and sampled to form a covalent bond with the ligand in different poses. Formed poses with
covalent bond are minimized using the Prime VSGB2.0 energy model to score the top-covalent
poses. In covalent docking, ligand binding site was detected from three crucial residues at the main
protease namely His41, Cys145, and Glu166. As reaction type “nucleophilic addition to a double
bond” option is selected with the guidance of the covalent bonded co-crystalized structures of
inhibitors at the main protease. In docking process, default parameters were used.
3.1.3 MD Simulations and MM/GBSA analyses
The selected docking poses of Montelukast at the main protease and Spike/ACE-2 targets were
used in MD simulations. The used top-docking poses of complex structures were placed in
simulation boxes with orthorhombic box (box size was calculated based on buffer distance of 10.0
Å) and solvated with TIP3P water models. The simulation systems were neutralized by the addition
of counter ions and 0.15 M NaCl solution was used. Desmond program was used for all-atom MD
simulations.34 Before the production run, the systems were equilibrated using the default relaxation
protocol of the Desmond. Simulations were performed at constant physiological temperature (310
K) and constant pressure (1.01325 bar). For this aim, NPT ensemble was used with Nose–Hoover
thermostat35,36 and Martyna–Tobias–Klein barostat37. Smooth particle mesh Ewald method38 was
used to calculate long-range electrostatic interactions with periodic boundary conditions. The cutoff distance was set to 9.0 Å for short range electrostatics and Lennard-Jones interactions. The
RESPA multi-step integrator was used. The time steps were varied for interaction types (bonded
and near, 2 fs; far, 6 fs). Production time of the simulation was 1 µs for main protease and 0.5 µs
for Spike/ACE-2 simulations. In the Spike/ACE2 target protein (PDB, 6M0J), glycans were

included at the simulations. The OPLS3e force field was used in simulations. 2000 trajectory
frames were recorded with equal intervals during the simulations. The average Molecular
Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy of the Montelukast
were calculated for 200 trajectory frames throughout the simulations. VSGB 2.0 solvation model
was utilized during MM/GBSA calculations.
3.2 The 3CL Protease enzyme inhibition assay
For enzyme inhibition assessment Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based
cleavage assay by using 3CL Protease assay Kit (#79955-1 and #79955-2, BPS Bioscience, San
Diego CA, USA) was used. 100mM stock concentration of Montelukast was solved with dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), then diluted to working concentrations ranging 100nM to 100µM with 1X
assay buffer (20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.3) as manufacturer
suggested. Final DMSO concentrations were below 1% for each tested concentration. 15µl of 3CL
Protease enzyme was distributed to each well except “Blanks”. GC376 was used as an inhibitor
control. 5µl GC376 (50µM) was added to the wells designated as inhibitor control. 5µl of inhibitor
in different concentrations (100nM-10nM-1nM-1µM-10µM-100µM) was added to their relative
wells, and a 1X assay buffer/DMSO mixture was added to blanks and positive controls. 250µM
3CL protease substrate was added to each well to start the reaction, and its final concentration was
50µM in 25µl volume. After 4 hours of incubation at room temperature, fluorescence was
measured by a microtiter plate-reader (Hidex Sense Multi Mode Reader, Finland) at a wavelength
of 360nm for excitation and 460nm for emission. Blank values are subtracted from values of all
other wells. Percentage inhibitory activity of each concentration were calculated, the fluorescence
values from GC376 inhibitor control was set as zero percent activity and the fluorescence value
from no inhibitor control was set as 100% activity. The IC50 (i.e., half-maximal inhibitory
concentration) value was determined by also 3CL inhibitory screening assay. Absorbance values
were recorded and corresponding IC50 value was calculated by dose response – inhibition curve
and nonlinear regression analysis. The results were plotted with GraphPad Prism 8.0 software

3.3 Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)
Biacore T200 spectrometer Cytiva (Uppsala, Sweden) instrument was used. 3C-like proteinase
(Mybiosource), Biacore Amine Coupling Kit (Cytiva), Series S Sensor Chip CM5 (Cytiva), and
PBS containing 9.2% DMSO at pH 7.4 was used as running buffer.
Immobilization pH Scouting. The best immobilization condition for Mpro on CM5 chip was
determined by scouting of a 10 mM sodium acetate buffer at three different pH values, pH 4.0, 4.5
and 5.0. We determined that pH 4.0 was the optimal pH for immobilization.

Surface preparation with immobilization of main protease. Mpro was immobilized on CM5
Sensor Chip by activating the surface with 0.4 mol/L EDC / 0.1 mol/L NHS at a flow rate of 30
µL/min for 7 min. Mpro was dissolved in a 10 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, to yield a 30
µg/mL solution. Following activation, Mpro solution was injected over the activated sensor chip
surface at a flow rate of 30 µL/min for 6 min. Final ligand (Mpro) immobilization levels achieved
were 11330 response units (RUs).

The excess hydroxysuccinimidyl on the surface were

deactivated with 1M ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5, for 7 min at a flow rate of 30 µL/min.
The surface of a reference flow cell was activated with 0.4 mol/L EDC/0.1 mol/L NHS and then
deactivated with 1 mol/L ethanolamine, with respective flow rates and times.
Analyte Injection. Before analyte injection, the sensor chip surface was conditioned with three
12.5 mM NaOH pulses of 30 sec followed by three start-up cycles, allowing the response to
stabilize before analyte injection. We used 8 different percent of DMSO solutions; 10.0%, 9.8%,
9.6%, 9.4%, 9.2%, 9.0%, 8.8% and 8.6% in the solvent correction cycles to correct responses for
variations in the bulk refractive index of the samples. Data were collected at a temperature of 25°C
and 1 Hz rate. Montelukast was tested from lowest to highest concentration. During each sample
cycle, analyte was injected for 60 sec at a flow rate of 30 µL/min. Dissociation period was
monitored for 120 sec after analyte injection before regeneration with 12.5 mM NaOH for 30 sec
at a flow rate of 30 µL/min to wash any remaining analyte from the sensor chip and wash flow
with 50% DMSO before running the next sample.
1:1 Steady-State Binding Affinity Analysis. Responses measured in the blank flow cell (control)
were subtracted from the response measured in the active flow cell. The binding affinity (KD) of
the interaction was obtained by plotting double-referenced binding responses versus Montelukast
concentration and fitting the curve using a 1:1 steady-state affinity with constant Rmax interaction
model.

3.4. Cell Viability Assay
Cell Culture Conditions. The human embryonic kidney (HEK293T CRL-11268) and
Cercopithecus aethiops kidney (Vero E6, CRL1586), human lung adenocarcinoma (Calu-3, HTB55; A549, CCL185) cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,

USA). They were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, p# 41965 Gibco)
including 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, p# 10500 Gibco), 1% antibiotic-antimycotic in the tissue
flasks and incubated at 37 oC and 5% CO2. They were subcultured and used for cell viability and
pseudovirus neutralization assay when they reach 70 - 80% confluency.
Cell Viability Assay. HEK293T, Vero E6, Calu-3, and A549 cells were cultured at a cell density
of 1 x 104 in the 96-well plates incubated at 37 oC, and % 5 CO2 for 24 hrs. Following day, after
aspiration of the medium, Montelukast (p# 1446859 Sigma-Aldrich) was added at concentrations
of 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 µM in DMEM and incubated for 24, 48, and 72 hrs. To measure
the cell viability, MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide, p#
M5655, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in Phosphate Buffer Solution (PBS, 5 mg/ml). After each
incubation periods, MTT at 5 µg/ml in DMEM was added into the each well and incubated at 37
°C and 5 % CO2 for 4 h. The formazan crystals dissolving solution, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO
p# D 8418, Sigma-Aldrich) was added into the each well and incubated for 2 hrs. The absorbance
was measured on an ELISA plate reader with a test wavelength of 570 nm and a reference
wavelength of 630 nm.
3.4.1 Pseudovirus production and infection
Transfection. HEK293T is highly transfectable cell line and widely used for retroviral production.
Lentiviral-based pseudoviruses bearing SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) or VSV-G glycoproteins were
produced based on previous studies.39 Briefly, HEK293T cells were seeded at a cell density of
5x105 cells/well on the 6-well plates. Next day, the cells in each well at approximately 70-80%
confluency were used for transfection. After aspiration of the medium from each well, the
transfection agent Fugene-6 in 10 µl was added on the 100 µl of DMEM basal medium (without
FBS and Pen/Strep) in the 1.5 ml of tube and incubated 5 min at room temperature (RT). In another
tube, 7500 ng of lenti RRL_GFP reporter plasmid, 6750 ng of psPAX2 packaging plasmid
(Addgene plasmid # 12260), and 750 ng of Spike-18aa truncated (Addgene plasmid # 149541)
were mixed. The plasmid mix was added into the fugen-6 tube and incubated 25-30 min at RT and
then placed drop by drop over the cells in the well. After 14-16h of transfection, the media was
removed, and fresh full media (DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep) was added on the cells.
After 48h of transfection, the pseudoviruses were collected, and filtered through 0.45 µm syringe

filters, and stored at +4 oC for short term usage (up to 3-4 days), or stored at -80 oC for long term
storage.
3.4.2 Pseudovirus Neutralization Assay
To render the cells infection by pseudoviruses, HEK293T cells on the wells were co-transfected
with 1250 ng of ACE2 (Addgene plasmid #141185) and 1250 ng of TMPRSS2 expression
plasmids (Addgene plasmid #145843) in the 6-well plate. After 48 hr of transfection period,
HEK293T cells were harvested and seeded at 2x104 cells/well on 96-well black plates and
incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 hr. Following day, 50 µl previously prepared pseudoviruses
and 50 µl of each tested concentration of Montelukast in the conditioned media were mixed in the
tubes and incubated for 60 min at RT then directly used to infect ACE2 and TMPRSS2-expressing
HEK293T cells. The infection rate by pseudoviruses was determined by measuring fluorescence
intensity due to GFP reporter plasmids in the microplate reader. The cell viability at the same wells
was determined by using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay Kit (# G7571, Promega).
Neutralization efficiency was calculated as relative fluorescence to the conditioned media
collected from mock-transfected cells.
3.5. Virus Neutralization Assay Using xCELLigence MP Real Time Cell Analyzer
In the experiment, VERO E6 cell line (passage number: 17) was used. VERO E6 cells were
cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with low glucose (DMEM/LOW GLUCOSE,
HyClone, Cat # SH30021.01, lot # AF29484096) supplemented with final concentration of 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone, Cat # SV30160.03, lot # RE00000002) and
1% penicillin (10,000 Units/ml) - streptomycin (10,000 Units/ml) (HyClone, Cat # SV30010, Lot
# J190007). Sample stocks were diluted in DMEM low glucose supplemented with 2% FBS to
make a concentration range. Neutralization assay was performed based on impedance using
xCELLigence MP real time cell analyzer equipment (RTCA). The impedance is expressed as
arbitrary units called cell index. VERO E6 cells were suspended in DMEM low glucose
supplemented with 10% FBS and seeded into a disposable sterile 96-well E-plate of the
xCELLigence RTCA MP device as final cell concentration of 2.5x104 cells per well. The
instrument has been placed in a CO2 cell culture incubator during the experiment, and controlled
by a cable connected to the control unit located outside the incubator. The cells on 96-well E-Plate
was placed in the xCELLigence RTCA MP device, and incubated for 24 hours. After incubation,

the cells were inoculated with 106 PFU SARS-CoV2 virus for an hour in DMEM low glucose
supplemented with 2% FBS. Then, the Montelukast samples that were prepared in accordance with
the sample preparation protocol in different concentrations (375 µM, 188 µM, 94 µM, 47 µM, 23
µM, 12 µM, 6 µM, 3 µM and 1.5 µM) were added to the wells of the E-Plate. Cells were incubated
in 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Real time measurement for each cell line was collected
for 150 hours with intervals of 15 min. At the end of the period, the experiment was terminated
and the data obtained were analyzed using RTCA Software Pro software.
The electrical conductivity is converted into the unitless cell index (CI) parameter by the
xCELLigence MP device every 15 minutes. The increase in CI indicates cell viability / health,
whereas a decrease indicates cell death / unhealth. It is expected that VERO E6 cells in the presence
of the SARS-CoV2 virus will demonstrate a decrease in CI values. The data obtained in the graphic
in figures are normalized according to the time point when the virus was added to the experiment.
The samples in the figure are indicated according to their color codes.
4. Conclusions
Here, the potential effect of the Montelukast on SARS-CoV-2 is investigated using multiscale
molecular modeling approaches and integrated in vitro experiments including FRET-based
binding assays, SPR, pseudovirus and virus neutralization methods. Our results show that
Montelukast has dual inhibitor effect and exerts its effect on SARS-CoV-2 by interference with
the entry of the virus into the host cell (via Spike/ACE-2) as well as it inhibits the 3C-like protease
which is responsible for functional protein maturation. Our results show that 12 µM Montelukast
concentration delays the CIT50 time by about 12 hours. It has been observed that Favipiravir, which
is one of the mostly used antiviral drugs in COVID-19 therapy, should be used in 16-fold more
doses than Montelukast in order to show the same effect. Since Montelukast is an approved drug
and has been widely used in the market for over 20 years against asthma, its side effects have been
well studied and the results show that it is a well-tolerated drug. Since its patent is expired in 2012,
its clinical usage at COVID19 can be urgently considered.
