Abstract

18

primates is commonly used in research settings. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is also regularly used

19

to determine the local virus production and immune effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the lower respiratory

20

tract. However, the potential interference of those two diagnostic modalities with each other is unknown

21

in non-human primates. The current study investigated the effect and duration of BAL on computed

22

tomography (CT) in both healthy and experimentally SARS-CoV-2-infected female rhesus macaques

23

(Macaca mulatta). In addition, the effect of subsequent BALs was reviewed. Thorax CTs and BALs

24

were obtained from four healthy animals and 11 experimentally SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. From

25

all animals, CTs were obtained just before BAL, and 24 hours post-BAL. Additionally, from the healthy

26

animals, CTs immediately after and four hours post-BAL were obtained. Thorax CTs were evaluated

27

for alterations in lung density, measured in Hounsfield units, and a visual semi-quantitative scoring

28

system. An increase in the lung density was observed on the immediately post-BAL CT but resolved

29

within 24 hours in the healthy animals. In the infected animals, a significant difference in both the lung

30

density and CT score was still found 24 hours after BAL. Furthermore, the differences between

31

timepoints in CT score were increased for the second BAL. These results indicate that the effect of BAL

32

on infected lungs is not completed within the first 24 hours. Therefore, it is of importance to

33

acknowledge the interference between BAL and CT in rhesus macaques.

Introduction

35
36

Infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the development

37

of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) was first described in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China at the end of

38

2019 (1). Since then, SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly across the globe, leading the World Health

39

Organization to officially declare COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by

40

the end of January 2020.

41
42

Animal models to investigate the infection progress, disease development, and to evaluate prophylactic

43

and therapeutic treatment options are important to answer several research questions. Due to the close

44

resemblance of their physiology and immune system to that of man, non-human primates (NHPs) play

45

a pivotal role in those aforementioned research topics (2-4). Multiple studies compared several NHP

46

models to identify their suitability for COVID-19 research, and demonstrated that Old World monkeys,

47

like macaques, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and develop a mild-to-moderate form of

48

disease (5-8).

49
50

Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are diagnostic procedures

51

widely used in clinical pulmonary research and veterinary medicine (9-12). These techniques are also

52

used in COVID-19 research in NHPs to gain more information and to create a bridge between the human

53

and NHP data (6, 13, 14). However, to the authors knowledge, no literature concerning the effect of

54

BAL on CT is available regarding NHPs .

55
56

For SARS-CoV-2, the infection is predominantly found in the respiratory tract. To determine infection

57

and viral load, nasopharyngeal and tracheal swabs are used to sample the upper respiratory tract. With

58

a BAL, samples from the lower respiratory tract can be obtained (12, 15). BAL fluid can be used both

59

as diagnostic tool and for detailed analysis of the infection. This includes a variety of analytical tests

60

such as cell counts and differential, cytopathologic analysis, and cultures in addition to specific

61

molecular and immunologic diagnostic tests (9). In COVID-19 research, it is predominantly used to

62

prove the presence of virus locally in the lungs. By combining swabs with a BAL, the majority of the

63

respiratory tract can be screened. Nevertheless, the utility of BAL in COVID-19 research or as

64

diagnostic procedure, in general, is arguable. A potential drawback of the use of BAL is the possibility

65

of artificial dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 and the impact on the readout of thorax CTs (13). In addition,

66

Geri et al. suggests that when the swabs of the upper respiratory tract and thorax CTs are negative it is

67

likely that the BAL is negative as well (16). Others state that BAL has a place in diagnosis of COVID-

68

19 besides swabs and imaging or that, in vaccine testing, BAL is more robust and specific to demonstrate

69

reduction in viral load than in nasal swabs and more specific than the lesions found on thorax CTs (17-

70

19).

71
72

The basis for successful execution of our COVID-19 infection studies is the use of an optimally-

73

characterized macaque infection model. We investigated the effect of BAL on thorax CTs of rhesus

74

macaques. Additionally, we determined the timeframe of possible interference as during BAL a part of

75

the instilled saline is left unrecovered in the lungs (12). Studies performed in dogs and humans

76

demonstrated that retained saline is correlated with an increase in lung opacity on immediate post-BAL

77

CTs (12, 15). By this the retained saline can mask COVID-19 associated lesions on CT as one of the

78

main groups of those lesions are ground glass opacities (GGOs) which are also characterized by a slight

79

increase in lung opacity (13, 20).

80
81

The aim of this study is to evaluate the time effects and potential impact of subsequent BALs on the

82

visualization and quantification of the lungs with CT in healthy and SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus

83

macaques to appraise possible differences during a viral infection.

Materials and Methods

85
86

Animals & Procedures

87

The study consisted of two groups of rhesus macaques; a non-infected group and a SARS-CoV-2

88

infected group. The study was conducted at the Biomedical Primate Research Centre (BPRC, Rijswijk,

89

The Netherlands). For the non-infected group, four healthy rhesus macaques were included. Three BAL

90

samples were taken to evaluate potential deleterious effects on the lung by using various thorax CTs.

91

For the infected group 11 macaques were analyzed, derived from three different COVID-19 studies.

92

These animals were selected out of those studies of which a CT was obtained before and 24 hours after

93

a BAL during the active phase of the infection. In addition, in four infected macaques an additional BAL

94

at day 2 and an additional CT immediately post-BAL was obtained.

95
96

As a timeline, for the non-infected animals three BALs were performed; on Day 0, 2 and 6 respectively

97

BAL 1, 2 and 3. With each BAL four CTs are obtained; pre-BAL, post-BAL, four hours post-BAL and

98

24 hours post-BAL. For the infected animals one BAL is performed coupled with two CTs: pre-BAL

99

and 24 hours post-BAL. In addition, four of the infected animals underwent a subsequent BAL at day

100

2, 48 hours after the first BAL with a pre-BAL CT, post-BAL CT and 24 hours post-BAL CT.

101
102

All animals were of Indian origin, female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), purpose bred at the

103

BPRC. During the study the animals were socially housed in pairs. All animals were between 7 and 16

104

years old and weighed between 6.2 to 11.5 kg. Cages for each pair of animals measured 1 x 2 x 2 meters

105

and were divided into different compartments that were freely accessible to allow animals the choice

106

where to sit. All cages were provided with bedding to allow foraging, environmental enrichment such

107

as fire hoses, mirrors and toys. Daily, all animals also received additional food enrichment items. All

108

procedures, husbandry, and housing performed in this study were in accordance with the Dutch laws on

109

animal experimentation and the regulations for animal handling as described in EU Directive 63/2010.

BPRC is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care

111

(AAALAC) International. The study was performed under a project license issued by the Competent

112

Authorities (Central Committee for Animal experiments, license no. AVD5020020209404). Before the

113

start of the study, approval was obtained, by the institutional animal welfare body (CCD 028 Evaluation

114

of vaccines and antiviral compounds against emerging coronavirus infections).

115
116

The procedures were all performed in the morning. All macaques were fasted overnight before the

117

procedure while water was freely available throughout. Animals were anesthetized in their home cage

118

with ketamin (10 mg/kg, ketamine hydrochloride, Ketamin 10%; Alfasan Nederland BV, Woerden, the

119

Netherlands) combined with medetomidine hydrochloride (0.05 mg/kg, Sedastart; AST Farma B.V.,

120

Oudewater, the Netherlands) intramuscular (IM) and were transferred to the CT-room. At the end of the

121

procedures, when the macaques returned to their home cage, atipamezole (0.25 mg/kg, Sedastop; AST

122

Farma B.V., Oudewater, the Netherlands) was administered IM. In addition, during every sedation

123

bodyweight was measured.

124
125

Bronchoalveolar lavage

126

Fiber-optic bronchoscopy (FOB) with BAL targeting the left lung was performed at various timepoints.

127

The procedure was executed as described before (21). Three volumes of 20 ml of prewarmed sterile

128

0.9% saline solution (NaCl 0.9%; B. Braun medical B.V., Oss, the Netherlands) were consecutively

129

instilled in the left lung and subsequently aspirated. In all cases at least 85% of the fluid was recovered.

130

After BAL the animals were transported back to the CT-room, located next to the BAL-room, were the

131

CT was immediately obtained. For the time between the subsequent scans, the animals were transferred

132

back to their home cage.

134

Computed tomography

135

Non-invasive, free breathing, CT data were acquired on several timepoints but also always pre-infection

136

using a MultiScan Large Field of View Extreme Resolution Research Imager (LFER) 150 PET-CT

137

(Mediso Medical Imaging Systems Ltd., Budapest, Hungary). The macaques were positioned head first

138

supine (HFS) with the arms up and fixated in a vacuum pillow. A single CT of the thorax takes 35

139

seconds by which respiratory motion is inevitable. To mitigate the impact of respiratory motion and

140

improve the image quality, respiratory gating was applied. The respiratory amplitude was detected with

141

a gating pad placed next to the umbilicus. For the final reconstruction, the inspiration phases were

142

exclusively used and manually selected (22).

143

For five of the SARS-CoV-2 infected animals, the 24 hours post-BAL CT was part of a PET-CT

144

procedure. This procedure is described elsewhere (23).

145
146

SARS-CoV-2 infection

147

A group of 11 animals was exposed to a dose of 1 x 105 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2, diluted in phosphate

148

buffered saline (PBS). The virus was inoculated via a combination of the intratracheal route and

149

intranasal route. During the infection period the animals were checked twice daily by the animal

150

caretakers and scored for clinical symptoms. All animals used in this project had a confirmed SARS-

151

CoV-2 infection as determined by multiple positive RT-PCR scores. RT-PCR scores were determined

152

as described elsewhere (24, 25). The clinical and pathological data will be described separately.

153
154

Data analysis

155

CT scoring

156

A semi-quantitative scoring system for thorax CT evaluation was used to estimate SARS-CoV-2-

157

induced lung disease (7, 13). Quantification of the opacities on the CTs was performed independently

158

by two experienced imaging scientists based on the sum of the lobar scores. The degree of involvement

159

in each zone was scored as: 0 for no involvement, 1 for <5%, 2 for 5-24%, 3 for 25-49%, 4 for 50-74%

160

and 5 for >=75% involvement. An additional increase or decrease of 0.5 was used to indicate alterations

161

in CT density of the lesions. By using this scoring system, a maximum score of 35 could be reached for

162

the combined lobes per time point.

163
164

Lung density

165

In each CT, in two representative planes, in the coronal direction, regions of interest (ROIs) were

166

manually drawn over the left and right lung with a slice thickness of 12 mm using Vivoquant v4.5

167

(InVicro, Boston, USA). The first plane was defined in the center of the carina. The second plane was

168

drawn more ventral at a predefined distance of 50 mm from the first plane ending up roughly in the

169

center of the heart. Of those ROIs a histogram was generated representing the voxel intensity, measured

170

in Hounsfield units (HUs) ranging from -1000 till 0. HUs are linearly correlated with physical density

171

and in this way alterations in the lung density pattern after BAL could be visualized. For analyses the

172

histogram was divided into three parts; -1000/-600, -600/-400, and -400/0, which were defined as low

173

density (LD), medium density (MD) and high density (HD) respectively. The LD was defined as healthy

174

lung based on the average value of the non-infected animals. The HD was characterized as non-healthy

175

lung tissue and the MD as in between, in this range the differences between scans were also captured

176

due to the normal existing differences in respiratory amplitude and pattern. Afterwards absolute values

177

were converted to relative values to compensate for the difference in lung volume both between scans

178

and between animals and calculated as area under the curve (AUC).

179
180

Statistical analysis

181

Statistical tests were performed with SPSS statistics v26 and GraphPad prism v8.4.2. After testing for

182

normal distribution, the t-test was used to compare the results obtained from the histograms and the

183

Wilcoxon test for CT scores. For correlation analysis, respectively a Pearson and Spearman correlation

184

were applied. The level of significance was a=0.05, all tests were performed two-sided and where

185

possible paired.

186

Results

187

Before comparing the different groups and timepoints with each other, the entire group of animals was

188

examined for possible confounding factors in relation to age and weight. In correlation with both visual

189

and quantitative assessment no confounding factors were found for these parameters.

190
191

Visual assessment non-infected group

192

In all non-infected animals, an increase in density was visible in the lavaged lung around the opening of

193

the main bronchus at the CT performed immediately post-BAL. The increased density was more focused

194

in either the middle or the lower lobe. Overall the spread of the BAL fluid was more in the dorsal

195

direction of the lungs than the ventral direction. At the scan obtained four hours post-BAL, the majority

196

of these alterations observed immediately post-BAL were resolved. In addition, the density of the lesions

197

was decreased. At the scan obtained 24 hours after the BAL, the lungs had visually returned to baseline

198

values obtained just before BAL. This pattern was similar in all BALs. The timeline and representative

The individual scores pre-/post-BAL of the CT images on the different timepoints are summarized in

The average difference in CT score for the left lung between the pre-BAL CT and the CT obtained after

212

24 hours was 0.2, confirming that at 24 hours post-BAL the appearance of the lungs is comparable to

213

the situation pre-BAL. Nevertheless, when comparing the subsequent BALs with each other, the CT

214

score pre-BAL 2 and four hours post-BAL 2 were higher compared to the related time points of BAL 1

215

and BAL 3.

216
217

Post-BAL the left lung scored between 8-11, a significantly higher score compared to all pre-BAL

218

timepoints (p<0.001). Four hours post-BAL, the CT scores in the left lung where still increased but the

219

difference was not significant anymore (p=0.19). Additionally, post-BAL two animals showed a positive

220

CT score in the right lung but had returned to baseline values at four hours post-BAL. In two timepoints

221

a positive CT score in the right lung was observed at the CT 24 hours post-BAL, the reason for this is

222

unclear.

228

There was a significant difference for all three BALs visible at the post-BAL CT for the left lung for

229

both the LD and HD range; LD (decrease in AUC of 30.6%, p=0.003), HD (increase in AUC of 86.7%,

230

p= 0.001). At four hours post-BAL, this difference was still significant compared to the pre-BAL values,

231

now also for the MD range (decrease in AUC of 10.0%, p=0.026), but the AUC change reversed for

232

both LD (increase in AUC of 16.5%, p=0.014) and HD (decrease in AUC of 14.4%, p=0.012) for the

233

left lung. There were also differences found within the right lung, for the four hour timepoint, for the

234

entire histogram; LD (increase in AUC of 11.5%, p=0.012), MD (decrease in AUC of 19.8%, p=0.026),

235

HD (decrease in AUC of 9.4%, p=0.079). For 24 hours post-BAL, no significant differences were

236

observed.

Visual assessment SARS-CoV-2 infected group

239

In Figure 3, representative pre-BAL CT and 24 hours post-BAL CT cross sections are shown of two

240

animals, while infected with SARS-CoV-2. The lesions found in the animal visualized in the upper

241

row (RM 13) were minimal and slightly increased on the 24 hours post-BAL timepoint (Video 5-6).

242

For the animal visualized in the bottom row (RM 8), the density of both lungs was increased. For the

243

left lung multiple consolidations were observed on the 24 hours post-BAL CT. On the left side the

244

entire lung, predominantly dorsal, was affected whereas on the pre-BAL CT the majority of the lesions

245

were found in the lower lobe in combination with a ggo in the upper lobe. In addition, in the right lung

246

moderate lesions were detected (Video 7-8).

247

Figure3: CTs of two infected animals. Upper row RM13; bottom row RM8. Pre-BAL on the left side, and 24 hours postBAL on the right.

248

In line with the SARS-CoV-2 infection all animals had a positive CT score in at least one side of the

249

lung at the pre-BAL timepoint. In these animals the CT score of the left lung 24 hours post-BAL was

250

significantly increased (p=0.007) compared to pre-BAL CT score with a positive correlation (r=0.907

251

p<0.0001). For the right lung this difference was not observed. The individual scores of these infected

Quantitative assessment SARS-273 CoV-2 infected group

264

In Figure 4, the histograms of two representative SARS-CoV-2-infected animals are visualized. These

265

histograms illustrate the relative AUC for the HU values, and with this density of the lungs of the CT

266

obtained before BAL and 24 hours after BAL.

267

A significant increase in AUC (19.4%) was found for the right lung in the LD range (p=0.004) and a

268

significant decrease in AUC (16.6%) in the MD range (p=0.002). For the left lung a significant

269

difference was only found in the HD range (increase in AUC of 23.2%, p=0.016).

Comparison BAL 1 versus BAL 2

274

For investigating the impact of subsequent BALs obtained within a time range of a couple of days, we

275

had seven animals (three non-infected and four infected) from which two BALs were taken within 48

276

hours. A significant difference in AUC, for the left lung, at the pre-BAL 2 CT was found for both the

277

LD range (decrease in AUC of 27.3%, p=0.022) and MD range (increase in AUC of 18%, p=0.010) and

278

a trend within the HD range (increase in AUC of 55.2%, p=0.076). Also, for the CT score a significant

279

increase was observed for the left lung (p=0.016) at this pre-BAL 2 timepoint compared to the pre-BAL

280

1 timepoint. To explore whether there are differences in the CT scores between the timepoints in both

281

BALs, the CT scores were subtracted from their respective pre-BAL CT score. In this way, a significant

282

increase in CT score was found for the left lung for the post-BAL timepoint of BAL 1 versus BAL 2

283

(p=0.047) and for the 24 hours post BAL timepoint of BAL 1 versus BAL 2 (p=0.031). In addition, for

284

these values a positive correlation was found (r=0,77). These differences, for the 24 hours post BAL

285

timepoint, were also detected for all ranges of the histogram; LD (p=0.023), MD (p=0.042) and HD

286

(p=0.015). For the right lung, no significant differences were found for lung density and CT scores or

287

subtracted scores.

Discussion

292

In infectious lung diseases, both CT and BAL are valuable diagnostic modalities which are often

293

executed in preclinical and clinical research. However, the possible interference of BAL on CT has not

294

been investigated so far in NHPs. The findings in this study demonstrate that, in general, thorax CT

295

alterations due to BAL seem to be resolved within 24 hours in non-infected macaques. However, for

296

SARS-CoV-2 infected animals, significant differences for both the semi-quantitative CT score and

297

quantitative AUCs were found at the 24 hours post-BAL CT. In addition, the response of the second

298

BAL within 48 hours of the first BAL shows significant alterations supporting the idea that the effect of

299

the BAL is not finished after 24 hours and therefore might influence acquired CT data.

300
301

The pulmonary changes induced by BAL fluid were most pronounced on the immediate post-BAL CT.

302

On those images, increased radiographic opacities were found due to the BAL procedure. The majority

303

of these opacities decreased within four hours after BAL and returned to normal within 24 hours after

304

the procedure. Despite differences in BAL procedure, the changing opacities in time after BAL seen in

305

the macaques are comparable to results obtained in humans (15) and dogs (12). In both studies, a known

306

amount of unrecovered BAL fluid was left in the lung, bilateral in humans and unilateral in dogs. In

307

addition, in dogs no aspiration or repeated instillation was performed. In this study, the procedure was

308

similar to commonly used BAL techniques including repeated fluid instillation and subsequent

309

aspirations. As for the findings in the right lung, the CT score immediately post-BAL was possibly

310

caused by redistribution or a spill of the retained saline due to a change of body posture or by coughing

311

(15). This was supported by the fact that at four hours post-BAL no alterations where found in the right

312

lung anymore. In addition, an explanation for the CT score found 24 hours post-BAL remains unclear.

313
314

The current study does not provide evidence of an increased percentage of retained fluid but

315

redistribution between the lung lobes due to coughing cannot be excluded. The differences found

316

between BAL 1 and BAL 2 suggest that the effect of these procedures is still ongoing 24 hours after

317

subsequent BALs, however not clearly visible. As BAL 3 was obtained four days after BAL 2, it was

15

318

not expected to find ongoing effects that could be related to BAL 2. By comparing all the outcome

319

parameters from BAL 1 with BAL 3 and BAL 2 with BAL 3 significant differences were not found.

320
321

Multiple publications showed that NHPs are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and develop a mild-

322

to-moderate form of disease (5-8), with the discrimination made between mild and moderate based on

323

the presence or absence of imaging findings (26). In the current study, the majority of the infected

324

animals (15/17) showed CT scores above zero at the pre-BAL timepoint. In addition, infection with

325

SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in each animal by RT-PCR. The strong positive correlation that was found

326

between the pre-BAL and 24 hour post-BAL CT scores indicates that a BAL can potentially enhance

327

the visual pathology of infected lung tissue. As COVID-19 is a rapidly developing infection it cannot

328

be excluded that the increase in CT score is due to a worsening of the disease. However, in patients

329

fluctuations in thorax CT abnormalities are not observed during the active phase of the infection. The

330

active phase can be divided in four stages; early (day 0-5), progressive (day 5-8), peak (day 9-13) and

331

late stage (> 14 days) suggesting a Gaussian curve in the temporal evolution of lung abnormalities (27).

332

This is supported by the observation during multiple studies at our facility, that SARS-CoV-2 infected

333

rhesus macaques show an equal or even lower score in subsequent CTs obtained over 24 hours after

334

BAL though before ten days post infection (data not shown). The current study suggests that these

335

fluctuations found are induced by the BAL as all scans are obtained within the first ten days of infection.

336
337

Furthermore, the right lung showed less lesions compared to the left lung. As the number of lesions

338

reflected by the CT score seems to influence the outcome this may be of impact. Since the infection with

339

SARS-CoV-19 went by intratracheal and intranasal route it was expected that both lungs would reveal

340

a similar CT score. However, in the animals included in this study, the left lung showed more lesions

341

compared to the right lung. An unexpected finding, as this was not observed in other SARS-CoV-2

342

infection studies performed at our institute. What was observed is the high level of heterogeneity

343

between the animals in the infectious take of SARS-CoV-2. This is probably coincidence as our animal

344

selection was solely based on availability of BALs coupled with CTs.

346

As expected the animals showed an increase in HD range of the left lung, caused by the remnants of the

347

BAL fluid. More interestingly, an increase in the LD range in their non-lavaged right lung was found.

348

Amigoni et al. showed in mice, that the relative tidal volume of the contralateral lung of an injured lung

349

increased while mechanical ventilated (28). These data support the hypothesis that the contralateral lung

350

will develop a coping mechanism to ensure sufficient oxygenation. The AUC decrease in LD and MD

351

versus increase in HD immediate post-BAL can be explained by the instillation of relative HD saline.

352

These findings are in corroboration with the measured post-BAL non-air volumes in humans (15). At

353

four hours post-BAL, the reversed significant difference, compared to the pre-BAL values for both LD

354

and HD for the left lung, could probably be explained as a similar compensating reaction described

355

above to the initial loss of LD tissue in the lavaged lobe of the lung. This assumption can neither be

356

confirmed nor completely denied with the limited amount of data available on this topic. Further

357

research on lobar regions with more subjects is necessary to confirm these findings.

358
359

Another objective was to investigate the impact of multiple BALs on CT. Therefore, we compared BAL

360

1 and BAL 2, performed within 48 hours in seven animals. It was interesting to find a difference in

361

AUC, for the left lung, in all ranges. These findings confirm the impact of the BAL on the recovery time

362

based on the readout of thorax CTs when multiple BALs are performed in a short period of time (13).

363

As four animals in this group were infected, although unlikely, artificial dissemination of SARS-CoV-

364

2 cannot be excluded.

365
366

Whereas the discussion concerning the diagnostic value of both BAL and CT in human is ongoing (15,

367

18), there is consensus of the value of both procedures in COVID-19 NHP models (6, 13, 14, 19). The

368

current study shows that when using both BAL and CT it is of importance to acknowledge the existing

369

interference between those two valuable techniques in rhesus macaques.
