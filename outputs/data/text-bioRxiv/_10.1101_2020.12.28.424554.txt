SUMMARY

29

SARS-CoV-2 has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Although passively delivered

30

neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 show promise in clinical trials, their mechanism of

31

action in vivo is incompletely understood. Here, we define correlates of protection of neutralizing

32

human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. Whereas Fc effector

33

functions are dispensable when representative neutralizing mAbs are administered as

34

prophylaxis, they are required for optimal protection as therapy. When given after infection,

35

intact mAbs reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden and lung disease in mice and hamsters better than

36

loss-of-function Fc variant mAbs. Fc engagement of neutralizing antibodies mitigates

37

inflammation and improves respiratory mechanics, and transcriptional profiling suggests these

38

phenotypes are associated with diminished innate immune signaling and preserved tissue

39

repair. Immune cell depletions establish that neutralizing mAbs require monocytes for

40

therapeutic efficacy. Thus, potently neutralizing mAbs require Fc effector functions for maximal

41

therapeutic benefit during therapy to modulate protective immune responses and mitigate lung

42

disease.

INTRODUCTION

44

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the recently

45

emerged RNA virus responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that

46

has led to over 52 million infections and over 1.29 million deaths (Dong et al., 2020). Clinical

47

disease is variable, ranging from asymptomatic infection to multi-organ failure and death. The

48

need for effective countermeasures of COVID-19 is urgent, as only dexamethasone and

49

remdesivir have demonstrated clinical efficacy in specific indications. One promising approach

50

for both the prevention and treatment COVID-19 has been the development of SARS-CoV-2-

51

neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from the B cells of individuals with recent

52

SARS-CoV-2 infection (Abraham, 2020; Marovich et al., 2020). Multiple neutralizing mAbs

53

directed against the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified that target non-

54

overlapping epitopes and show differences in neutralization potency (Alsoussi et al., 2020; Cao

55

et al., 2020; Hansen et al., 2020; Ju et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Noy-Porat et al., 2020; Pinto et

56

al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020a). The majority of these mAbs bind to the S1

57

subunit, specifically the receptor binding domain (RBD), and inhibit virus attachment to its

58

principal cell surface receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2.

59

Prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of anti-S mAbs has been demonstrated in vivo in

60

murine, hamster, and non-human primate models of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis (Alsoussi et al.,

61

2020; Baum et al., 2020; Fagre et al., 2020; Hansen et al., 2020; Hassan et al., 2020; Kreye et

62

al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020a), with varying degrees of

63

reduction in viral burden and dampened inflammation of the lung. However, the mechanisms of

64

protection in vivo can be due to multiple factors including direct virus neutralization and

65

engagement of complement or Fc gamma receptors (FcgRs) on leukocytes. Fc effector

66

functions of antibodies can promote immune-mediated clearance mechanisms (by antibody-

67

dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, and complement

68

activation), enhance antigen presentation and CD8+ T cell responses, and reshape inflammation

69

through engagement of individual FcgRs on specific hematopoietic cells (Lu et al., 2018). In

70

contrast, under certain circumstances, Fc-FcgR interactions can promote antibody-dependent

71

enhancement of virus infection (ADE) (Halstead, 1994) or pathological immune skewing (Bolles

72

et al., 2011; Ruckwardt et al., 2019), which is at least a theoretical concern of antibody-based

73

therapies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (Diamond and Pierson, 2020). Thus, a more

74

thorough understanding of the contribution of Fc effector functions in the context of antibody-

75

based therapies is needed.

76

Here, we use the K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis

77

(Golden et al., 2020; Winkler et al., 2020) and a Fc region genetic variant form of IgG (LALA-

78

PG) of a potent RBD-binding neutralizing mAb (COV2-2050) that cannot engage FcgRs or

79

complement to define the role of Fc effector functions in antibody protection. We find that Fc

80

effector functions are dispensable when neutralizing mAbs are administered as prophylaxis, but

81

unexpectedly, they are required for optimal protection when given as post-exposure therapy.

82

When administered after SARS-CoV-2 infection, intact but not LALA-PG mAbs reduce viral

83

burden and lung disease. Fc engagement by antibodies decreases immune cell infiltration and

84

levels of inflammatory cytokines, and this activity is linked to improved respiratory mechanics

85

and outcome. RNA sequencing analysis of lung homogenates reveals distinct gene signatures

86

associated with Fc engagement including decreased innate immune signaling and extracellular

87

matrix remodeling but maintained expression of genes that mediate tissue repair. Immune cell

88

depletions showed that neutralizing mAbs require monocytes for therapeutic efficacy. We

89

confirmed these findings in mice with additional RBD-binding neutralizing mAbs (COV2-3025,

90

COV2-2072, and COV2-2381) as well as in hamsters, a second mammalian species, as Fc

91

effector functions of a neutralizing mAb also are required to prevent weight loss, control viral

92

infection, and limit inflammation. Overall, these studies establish that Fc effector functions of

RESULTS

97

Pre-exposure protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice by a neutralizing

98

mAb does not require Fc effector functions. Passive transfer of neutralizing mAbs targeting

99

the S protein confers protection in multiple pre-clinical models of SARS CoV-2 infection

100

(Alsoussi et al., 2020; Baum et al., 2020; Hansen et al., 2020; Hassan et al., 2020; Kreye et al.,

101

2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020a). However, in vivo antiviral efficacy can be due to

102

multiple mechanisms including Fab-dependent direct virus neutralization and Fc-dependent

103

engagement that promotes opsonization of virus, clearance of virally-infected cells, and

104

modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses (Bournazos et al., 2019; Bournazos et al.,

105

2014b; DiLillo et al., 2016; DiLillo et al., 2014; Fox et al., 2019). To evaluate the contribution of

106

Fc effector functions, we introduced loss-of-function LALA-PG (L234A, L235A, and P329G)

107

mutations into the human IgG1 heavy chain of COV2-2050, a previously described neutralizing

108

human mAb that binds the RBD of S and blocks ACE2 binding (Zost et al., 2020a), to abolish

109

antibody Fc interactions with FcγRs and complement proteins (Lo et al., 2017). Intact or LALA-

110

PG variants of COV2-2050 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 equivalently in cell culture (Fig 1A), and

111

introduction of the LALA-PG mutation prevented binding to mouse FcγRI and FcγRIV (Fig 1B).

112

To test their relative efficacy in vivo, we used the K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model of

113

SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in which human ACE2 expression is driven by the cytokeratin-18

114

gene promoter (McCray et al., 2007; Winkler et al., 2020). In prophylaxis studies, K18-hACE2

115

transgenic mice received decreasing doses of COV2-2050 or COV2-2050 LALA-PG (200 μg (10

116

mg/kg), 40 μg (2 mg/kg), 8 μg (0.4 mg/kg), or 1.6 μg (0.08 mg/kg)) by intraperitoneal injection 16

CoV/USA_WA1/2020). An isotype control human mAb (DENV-2D22) was delivered at a single

119

200 µg dose for comparison. At the time of SARS-CoV-2 challenge, the serum levels of COV2-

120

2050 or COV2-2050 LALA-PG were equivalent (Fig 1C). As expected, lower doses of COV2-

121

2050 resulted in decreasing neutralizing antibody titers in serum at the time of virus inoculation

122

(Fig 1D).

123

Effects on SARS-CoV-2-induced weight loss were comparable between COV2-2050 or

124

COV2-2050 LALA-PG at all doses with a loss of protection observed only at the 1.6 μg (0.08

125

mg/kg) dose (Fig 1E-F). Levels of COV2-2050 correlated with clinical protection (Fig 1G-H),

126

with a minimum serum neutralizing titer (NT50) of 1:104 and concentration of 212 ng/mL required

127

to prevent weight loss in this stringent challenge model. Although weight loss was prevented at

128

a dose of 1.6 μg per animal, a higher 8 μg (0.4 mg/kg) dose was required to reduce viral burden

129

in the lung at 7 days post-infection (dpi) (Fig 1I). Levels of COV2-2050 also correlated inversely

130

with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the lung (Fig 1J-K) with a minimum neutralizing titer of 1:381 and

131

mAb serum concentration of 851 ng/mL required to reduce viral infection at 7 dpi. Notably,

132

differences in viral burden were not observed at several different doses of COV2-2050 and

133

COV2-2050 LALA-PG treatment. Importantly, no evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement

134

of clinical disease or viral burden (Lee et al., 2020; Taylor et al., 2015) was detected even when

135

levels were below the protective dose. Thus, the Fc-dependent effector functions of COV2-2050

136

are dispensable for clinical and virological protection in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice when a

137

potently neutralizing antibody is administered as prophylaxis.

138

Fc effector functions enhance the therapeutic activity of neutralizing antibodies.

139

Although we did not detect a requirement for Fc effector functions when COV2-2050 was

140

administered as prophylaxis, we re-evaluated this observation in the setting of post-exposure

141

administration. We inoculated K18-hACE2 transgenic mice with SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal

142

route and then delivered a single 200 µg (10 mg/kg) dose of COV2-2050 or COV2-2050 LALA-

143

PG mAbs at 1 (D+1) or 2 (D+2) dpi by intraperitoneal injection. Whereas passive transfer of the

144

intact COV2-2050 prevented weight loss compared to isotype control mAb-treated animals, this

145

protection was lost in animals treated with the COV2-2050 LALA-PG variant (Fig 2A). The

146

differences in protection were not due to disparate levels of intact COV2-2050 and COV2-2050

147

LALA-PG variants, as equivalent amounts were detected in serum at 0 and 4 dpi (Fig 2B).

148

Treatment at 1 dpi with COV2-2050, but not COV2-2050 LALA-PG, reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral

149

RNA levels in the lung at 4 and 8 dpi substantially as measured by qRT-PCR (Fig 2C-D). In

150

contrast, D+2 treatment with either intact COV2-2050 or COV2-2050 LALA-PG did not reduce

151

viral RNA levels in the lung when compared to isotype-treated controls. However, COV2-2050

152

and COV2-2050 LALA-PG mAbs both reduced levels of infectious virus in the lung at 4 dpi (Fig

153

2E). Given the disparity in viral RNA levels, this effect might be due in part to ex vivo

154

neutralization after lung tissue homogenization, as reported for other respiratory viruses

155

(Subbarao et al., 2004; Wells et al., 1981). Although D+2 treatment did not reduce viral RNA

156

levels in the lung, K18-hACE2 mice receiving intact COV2-2050 at D+2, but not COV2-2050

157

LALA-PG, showed functional improvement in pulmonary mechanics including inspiratory

158

capacity, respiratory resistance, elastance, tissue damping, and compliance (Fig 2F). These

159

results correlated with a smaller downward deflection of the pressure-volume loop and improved

160

lung compliance and distensibility (Fig 2G).

161

To corroborate these results, we tested the therapeutic activity of additional neutralizing

162

human mAbs that bind the RBD on the S protein, COV2-3025, COV2-2072, and COV2-2381

163

(Zost et al., 2020b), and compared them to corresponding LALA-PG or LALA variants of each

164

mAb. For COV2-2381, we used a LALA variant of COV2-2381, since this version also is

165

commonly used to minimize Fc effector functions (Hessell et al., 2007; Sapparapu et al., 2016).

166

The LALA form lacks the P329G mutation, which is needed to fully abolish binding to all mouse

167

FcgRs (e.g., mouse FcgRII) and prevent complement deposition (Arduin et al., 2015; Lo et al.,

168

2017; Sondermann et al., 2000). COV2-3025, COV2-2072, and COV2-2381 neutralized SARS-

169

CoV-2 equivalently compared to their respective LALA-PG or LALA variants (Fig 2H, S1A, and

170

S1E) and introduction of the LALA mutation abolished binding to mouse FcγRI and FcγRIV (Fig

171

S1B). Administration of intact COV2-3025 at D+1 recapitulated the same pattern of protection

172

observed with COV2-2050 treatment: COV2-3025 LALA-PG failed to protect mice from weight

173

loss or reduce viral titers compared to the intact COV2-3025 (Fig 2I-J).

174

In comparison, COV2-2381 LALA partially protected against weight loss, and viral

175

burden was reduced in mice receiving either COV2-2381 or COV2-2381 LALA compared to

176

isotype-treated controls, although we noted a trend towards lower levels of viral RNA in animals

177

receiving the intact COV2-2381 (Fig S1C-D). Administration of COV2-2072 LALA-PG at D+1

178

partially protected against SARS-CoV-2-induced weight loss compared to the isotype-treated

179

controls, but failed to reduce viral titers, unlike the intact COV2-2072 (Fig S1F-G). The relative

180

differences in therapeutic capacity of COV2-2050 LALA-PG and COV2-3025 LALA-PG

181

compared to COV2-2381 LALA and COV2-2072 LALA-PG antibodies could be due to

182

differential neutralizing activity in vivo, disparate affinity for FcgR or complement, or because

183

these mAbs, which recognize distinct epitopes on RBD (Zost et al., 2020b), variably engage

184

immune effector molecules based on their orientation of binding to the virion (Renner et al.,

185

2018). Regardless, these results indicate that intact Fc effector functions of neutralizing

186

antibodies are needed for optimal therapeutic activity to mitigate clinical disease caused by

187

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notwithstanding this point, some antibodies (e.g., COV2-2381 and

188

COV2-2072) might confer therapeutic protection in the absence of Fc effector functions at least

189

at early time points post-infection, possibly due to differences in neutralizing activity in vivo.

190

Fc effector functions of a neutralizing antibody modulate the immune responses

191

to SARS-CoV-2 infection. An excessive pro-inflammatory host response to SARS-CoV-2

192

infection is hypothesized to contribute to pulmonary pathology and severe COVID-19

193

(Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020). Given that COV2-2050-mediated improvement in

194

pulmonary function was not associated with reduced viral RNA levels in the lung when given at

195

D+2, we speculated that the intact mAb might modulate immune cell and inflammatory

196

responses. Consistent with our previous study (Winkler et al., 2020), analysis of hematoxylin

197

and eosin-stained lung sections from isotype mAb-treated mice at 8 dpi showed perivascular

198

and parenchymal immune cell accumulation with accompanying edema and lung consolidation

199

(Fig 3A). Animals receiving COV2-2050 at D+1 showed markedly reduced lung inflammation

200

but this protection was lost in mice receiving COV2-2050 LALA-PG at D+1 or D+2. While COV2-

201

2050 treatment at D+2 did not completely reduce pathology, immune cell infiltration was more

202

focal in nature with patches of normal-appearing airspaces throughout the lung.

203

Measurements of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokines in the lung at 8 dpi showed

204

decreased levels of CXCL10, G-CSF, IL-6, IFN-g, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL19, and CXCL1

205

following both D+1 and D+2 COV2-2050 treatment, which did not occur in animals receiving

206

COV2-2050 LALA-PG (Fig 3B and S2). Cellular analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid

207

at 4 dpi (Fig S3, using the gating scheme of (Misharin et al., 2013)) showed significantly

208

reduced numbers of CD8+ T cells with a trend towards fewer monocytes after administration of

209

intact COV2-2050 at D+1. Differences in BAL fluid cell numbers were not observed at 4 dpi

210

when treatment with COV2-2050 or COV2-2050 LALA-PG was started at D+2 (Fig 3C).

211

However, at 8 dpi, we observed a significant reduction in the numbers of CD45+ cells,

212

neutrophils, and CD8+ T cells in mice treated at D+1 with COV2-2050 compared to COV2-2050

213

LALA-PG (Fig 3D), consistent with histopathological findings (Fig 3A). However, the only

214

difference in immune cell infiltrates in BAL fluid at D+2 was a reduced number of alveolar

215

macrophages in animals receiving COV2-2050 compared to COV2-2050 LALA-PG (Fig 3D).

216

Given that viral RNA levels were equivalent in mice receiving COV2-2050 and COV2-2050

217

LALA-PG at D+2 (Fig 2C and E) and only small differences in BAL cell number were observed,

218

Fc effector engagement may shape inflammatory immune responses independently of effects

219

on viral burden or the number and type of immune cells recruited.

220

Distinct transcriptional signatures in the lung after treatment with COV2-2050 or

COV2-2050 LALA-PG. To interrogate further the impact of Fc effector functions on protection,

we performed RNA sequencing of lung homogenates at 8 dpi in mice receiving an isotype

223

control mAb, COV2-2050, or COV2-2050 LALA-PG mAbs at 1 (D+1) or 2 (D+2) and compared

224

the results to those from samples from naïve mice. Principal component analysis (PCA)

225

revealed distinct transcriptional signatures associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection when

226

compared to mock-infected naïve animals. Treatment with intact COV2-2050 demonstrated a

227

clear transcriptional shift towards the naive group, whereas the profiles from COV2-2050 LALA-

228

PG-treated mice were more similar to isotype control mAb-treated animals (Fig 4A). Indeed,

229

only 91 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified when comparing the isotype

230

control mAb to the COV2-2050 LALA-PG D+1 group, whereas 2056 and 1975 DEGs were

231

detected when comparing COV2-2050 D+1 to isotype control and COV-2050 LALA-PG D+1,

232

respectively (Fig 4B). A similar large number of DEGs was observed in the lungs at 8 dpi from

233

mice treated at D+2 with COV-2050 or COV2-2050 LALA-PG (Fig 4B). Gene ontology analysis

234

of the top downregulated genes comparing COV2-2050 to COV2-2050 LALA-PG showed

235

immune gene clusters including cytokine-mediated signaling (e.g., Il10ra, Il15, Il17ra, Socs1,

236

and Jak3), type I IFN signaling (e.g., Ifnar2, Stat2, Ifit1, Ifit2, Ifit3, and Irf7), and leukocyte

237

chemotaxis (e.g., Ccl2, Cxcl10, and Ccl7) as well as genes involved in cell proliferation (e.g.,

238

Egfr, Fgfr1, Fosl1, Myc, and Cdkn2b) and metalloproteinase-mediated extracellular matrix

organization (e.g., Adam15, Adam19, Col1a, Mmp14, and Itgam) (Fig S4 and Table S1).

240

We next performed CompBio analysis (v2.0, PercayAI), as we did previously (Adamo et

241

al., 2020; Gehrig et al., 2019), to identify biological themes uniquely enriched in the COV2-2050-

242

treated groups compared to the isotype control and COV2-2050 LALA-PG-treated groups (Fig

243

4C, Table S2). Pathways unique to the COV2-2050 D+1 treatment group compared to the

244

isotype-treated group included genes involved in actinomyosin-associated cell adhesion (e.g.,

245

Kif1c, Ctnnd1, Nectin3, Unc45b, and Prkca) and Rho GTPase signaling (e.g., Rhoq, Mapk3,

246

Prkca, and Cdc42bpa), processes that are typically associated with wound repair programs

247

(Verboon and Parkhurst, 2015) (Fig 4D). The expression pattern of these gene sets in the

248

COV2-2050 D+1 treatment was similar to naïve animals, suggesting that the intact antibody

249

limited virus-induced perturbations in transcription. Pathways uniquely downregulated in the

250

COV2-2050 D+1 group included genes involved in type I IFN and NFkB-dependent signaling

251

(e.g., Irf7, Stat2, Nfkb2, Bst2, Isg15, and Ikbk3), which may in part be due to the lower levels of

252

viral RNA detected (Fig 2C-D and 4D).

253

Pathways that were downregulated in the D+2 COV2-2050-treated group compared to

254

the isotype control or D+2 COV2-2050 LALA-PG-treated animals included S100A8-associated

255

innate immune signaling (e.g., Reg3g, Saa3, Itgma, Mmp8, and S100a8), oncostatin M receptor

256

associated signaling (e.g., Il6, Osmr, Csf1, and Socs3), and extracellular matrix remodeling

257

(e.g., Adamts15, Col5a1, Vcam1, and Lama4) (Fig S5, Table S2). Thus, COV2-2050 treatment

258

at D+2 and the resultant Fc-dependent effector responses may differentially modulate neutrophil

259

activation, gp130 signaling, and tissue damage due to matrix metalloproteinase activation. Of

260

note, we also identified diminished expression of genes involved in immune complex clearance

261

following COV2-2050 versus COV2-2050 LALA-PG administration at D+2, which may reflect a

262

negative feedback loop of this pathway (Daëron and Lesourne, 2006). Collectively, our results

263

with intact COV-2050 suggest that Fc engagement by FcgR and/or complement can induce

264

distinct and protective transcriptional programs in the SARS-CoV-2-infected lung depending on

265

the timing of therapy.

266

Monocytes are required for optimal therapeutic activity of neutralizing mAb. Fc

267

engagement of FcgRs on innate immune cells including macrophages, monocytes, NK cells,

268

and neutrophils can lead to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or phagocytosis

269

(ADCP), modulation of inflammatory mediators produced by these cells, and enhanced adaptive

270

immunity (Bournazos et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2018). To determine which innate immune cells

271

contribute to the antibody-mediated protection observed in vivo, we depleted Ly6hi classical

272

monocytes (anti-CCR2) (Fig 5A and S6), natural killer (NK) cells (anti-NK1.1) (Fig 5B and S6),

273

or neutrophils (anti-Ly6G) (Fig 5C and S6) in combination with COV2-2050 treatment at D+1.

274

Depletion of neutrophils or NK cells did not affect SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in the presence of

275

COV2-2050 or the isotype control mAb (Fig 5B and C). However, when monocytes were

276

depleted, COV2-2050 failed to prevent the weight loss phenotype seen in non-depleted, COV2-

277

2050-treated mice (Fig 5A). Moreover, monocyte depletion in the setting of COV2-2050 therapy

278

was associated with greater immune cell infiltration and lung damage (Fig 5D). Indeed,

279

expression of Ccl2, Cxcl10, and Il6 were increased following COV2-2050 treatment and

280

monocyte depletion compared to treatment with COV2-2050 or an isotype control mAb (Fig 5E).

281

The monocyte depletion phenotype, however, was not associated with changes in viral RNA

282

levels at 8 dpi (Fig 5F). This result suggests that monocytes are a key immune cell type that

283

mediates therapeutic antibody-dependent protection through a mechanism that at least is

284

partially independent of viral clearance.

285

Fc effector functions enhance the therapeutic activity of neutralizing antibodies

286

against SARS-CoV-2 in Syrian hamsters. To validate the requirement for Fc effector functions

287

in optimal therapeutic antibody protection, we used a golden Syrian hamster model. This animal

288

model supports viral replication with corresponding weight loss and interstitial pneumonia

289

(Rosenke et al., 2020; Sia et al., 2020) and has been used to evaluate mAb-based therapies

290

and vaccines (Liu et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Tostanoski et al., 2020) against SARS-CoV-

291

2. We inoculated seven-month-old hamsters with SARS-CoV-2 (5 x 105 PFU, 2019 n-

292

CoV/USA_WA1/2020 strain) by the intranasal route and then delivered a single 1 mg (10 mg/kg)

293

dose of COV2-2050 or COV2-2050 LALA-PG mAbs at 1 dpi (D+1) by intraperitoneal injection.

294

Consistent with observations in mice, passive transfer of intact COV2-2050 prevented weight

295

loss compared to isotype mAb-treated animals at 5 and 6 dpi, and this protection was lost in

296

animals treated with the COV2-2050 LALA-PG variant (Fig 6A). Furthermore, hamsters treated

297

with intact COV2-2050, but not COV2-2050 LALA-PG, showed a reduction in viral RNA levels at

298

6 dpi (Fig 6B). The improved viral burden with COV2-2050 was associated with lower levels of

299

the inflammatory mediators Cxcl10, Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl5, and Ifit3 (Fig 6C). Thus, therapeutic

DISCUSSION

305

Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are a promising option for the

306

treatment of COIVD-19 and have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in a variety of pre-clinical

307

models (Abraham, 2020; Marovich et al., 2020). Antibody programs have reported encouraging

308

results in clinical trials (Chen et al., 2020), and recently, the FDA granted Emergency Use

309

Authorization to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 S mAb bamlanivimab for newly diagnosed, mild-to-

310

moderately ill, high-risk patients. However, the mechanisms of protection in vivo have not been

311

fully investigated and are assumed to be directly related to the neutralizing capacity of the mAb.

312

In this study, we examined the contributions of Fc effector functions for clinical and virological

313

protection in murine and hamster models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis. Whereas

314

intact Fc effector functions were not required when neutralizing mAbs were given as

315

prophylaxis, for several anti-RBD human mAbs tested in mice, a functional Fc region was

316

required for optimal protection as post-exposure therapy. This enhanced therapeutic efficacy of

317

intact COV2-2050 and COV2-3025 compared to their LALA-PG IgG loss-of-function Fc region

318

variants correlated with decreased viral burden, improved pulmonary function, diminished

319

inflammatory responses, and preserved tissue repair processes. In mice, cell depletion studies

320

identified monocytes as a key immune cell type for antibody-dependent clinical protection.

321

Fc effector function interactions were not required when neutralizing mAbs were

322

administered as prophylaxis, suggesting their mechanism of protection in a pre-exposure setting

323

depends largely on the neutralizing capacity of the antibody to prevent initial viral infection and

324

limit dissemination. In the stringent K18-hACE2 transgenic model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis

325

(Golden et al., 2020; Winkler et al., 2020), we defined minimum serum neutralizing titers (NT50)

326

and concentrations of 1:104 and 212 ng/ml for the prevention of weight loss and 1:381 and 851

327

ng/ml for reduction of viral burden in the lung. Establishing serum correlates of protection for

328

mAb- and vaccine-based therapies in pre-clinical models is an important first step for translation

329

and analysis of human studies. Levels of neutralizing antibody required for protection against

15

330

disease in humans might be lower due to the slower kinetics of disease pathogenesis and/or a

331

longer half-life of the antibody. Lastly, even at sub-protective doses of intact COV2-2050 (0.08

332

mg/kg), we did not observe evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection or

333

immune enhancement, consistent with other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and antibody treatment

334

studies (Baum et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Halstead and Katzelnick, 2020; Laczkó et al., 2020;

335

Luo et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2006; Rogers et al., 2020).

336

In contrast to prophylactic administration, Fc effector functions were required for optimal

337

efficacy when neutralizing mAbs were administered as post-exposure therapy. The treatment

338

window to reduce viral RNA levels in the lung in the stringent K18-hACE2 transgenic model was

339

essentially one day, suggesting that antibody therapy optimally should be given prior to the peak

340

of viral replication, which is 2 dpi in this model (Winkler et al., 2020). The narrow therapeutic

341

window for reducing viral load we observed could be related to the stoichiometry of antibody

342

binding required for virus neutralization (Pierson and Diamond, 2015), such that when too much

343

viral antigen is present in the lung, neutralization is limited. Against this hypothesis, infectious

344

virus levels were neutralized and equivalently low at 4 dpi in mice treated with intact or LALA-

345

PG versions of antibodies at 1 or 2 dpi, although it is possible that this effect is due to ex vivo

346

neutralization of virus after tissue homogenization (Subbarao et al., 2004; Wells et al., 1981).

347

More likely, the Fc effector functions of neutralizing antibodies serve to clear SARS-CoV-2

348

infected cells either directly by engagement of FcgR on myeloid cells and subsequent ADCP or

349

ADCC or through enhanced antigen presentation and induction of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell

350

responses (Bournazos et al., 2020). Although the precise mechanism awaits delineation, our

351

data suggests that in the post-exposure therapeutic setting, the neutralizing activity of most

352

RBD-specific antibodies may no longer be sufficient for optimal protection, and additional

353

mechanisms mediated by Fc effector functions are required. We acknowledge that some anti-

354

RBD mAbs with superior neutralizing activity in vivo may confer protection in the absence of Fc

355

effector functions at least at early time points post-infection. However, at later time points, once

16

356

infection is established and high amounts of viral RNA are produced in the lung, Fc effector

357

functions of even ‘elite’ neutralizing mAbs may be needed for immune modulation and the most

358

favorable clinical outcome.

359

With the lower levels of viral RNA in lungs of mice treated at 1 dpi with COV2-2050 but

360

not COV2-2050 LALA-PG, we also found reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, immune

361

cell infiltration, and expression of genes downstream of type I IFN and NFkB-dependent

362

signaling pathways. Transcriptional signatures associated with COV2-2050 therapy also

363

included enrichment of gene sets involved in tissue repair processes. This same pattern of

364

expression was observed in naïve mice, suggesting that Fc effector functions of antibodies may

365

limit virus-induced perturbations and maintain certain reparative homeostatic transcriptional

366

programs. Remarkably, administration of neutralizing mAb at 2 dpi still improved clinical

367

outcome and pulmonary function in an Fc-dependent manner without substantive reduction in

368

viral RNA levels. The gene signatures uniquely associated with intact COV2-2050 mAb

369

administration at 2 dpi differed from those at 1 dpi, as they showed reduced expression of

370

genes involved in neutrophil activation, IL-6 signaling, and metalloproteinase-mediated

371

extracellular matrix remodeling pathways. Altogether, these results suggest that at least some

372

neutralizing mAbs protect in vivo through multiple Fc-dependent mechanisms including viral

373

clearance and modulation of the immune response to enhance resolution of inflammation.

374

The importance of Fc effector functions for antibody efficacy in vivo has been illustrated

375

in other viral models, including HIV, Ebola, West Nile, hepatitis B, chikungunya, and influenza

376

viruses (Bournazos et al., 2020; DiLillo et al., 2016; DiLillo et al., 2014; Fox et al., 2019; Hessell

377

et al., 2007; Li et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; Vogt et al., 2011), although the specific cells

378

mediating this protection have been characterized in relatively few cases (Fox et al., 2019; He et

379

al., 2017). Our immune cell depletion studies showed that monocytes, but not neutrophils or NK

380

cells were necessary for mAb-dependent clinical protection and diminished pro-inflammatory

381

cytokine responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice, although monocyte depletion did

17

382

not affect viral burden. Circulating CCR2+ monocytes can differentiate into a different myeloid

383

cell subsets including interstitial macrophages and monocyte-derived dendritic cells following

384

migration into the lung (Jakubzick et al., 2017). The phenotype of these myeloid cells in the lung

385

can vary widely ranging from TNF/iNOS producing DCs (Tip-DCs) (Serbina et al., 2003) to

386

interstitial macrophages involved in tissue repair, and myeloid cell dysregulation has been linked

387

to severe COVID-19 in humans (Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020). Thus, Fc effector

388

engagement on monocyte-derived cells in the lung may not directly impact viral clearance, but

389

rather limit immunopathology through reprograming of the inflammatory response. Consistent

390

with this idea, administration of intact COV2-2050 but not COV2-2050 LALA-PG improved

391

clinical outcome and mitigated inflammation without decreasing viral RNA levels in the lung.

392

Notwithstanding these points, it remains to be determined which cell type is responsible for the

393

Fc-effector function dependent reductions in viral burden we observed with treatment at D+1;

394

this could occur through phagocytosis of infected cells by alveolar macrophages or other

395

myeloid cells that do not express CCR2 (He et al., 2017) or enhanced antigen presentation,

396

accelerated priming of CD8+ T cells, and cytolysis of virally infected cells (Bournazos et al.,

397

2020). Engineering of the Fc domain sequences to optimize or possibly enhance effector

398

functions (Bournazos et al., 2020; Lazar et al., 2006; Saunders, 2019) could have implications

399

for the therapeutic activity of neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2.

400

Our results highlight the importance of Fc effector functions of antibody in two animal

401

models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. While LALA-PG mutations abrogate binding to both FcγRs

402

and C1q, it remains unknown which of these effector molecules or particular receptors (e.g.,

403

FcgRI, FcgRIII, or FcgRIV) dominantly associate with loss of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb therapeutic

404

activity. Confirmatory studies also are needed in non-human primates, a model that more

405

closely recapitulates human mAb dosing kinetics in vivo. Moreover, we used human IgG1 anti-

406

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in mice and hamsters; FcgR expression patterns on immune cells and

18

407

human IgG-mouse/hamster FcgR interactions may not fully recapitulate patterns observed with

408

human IgG, human FcgRs, and human cells (Bournazos et al., 2014a). While transgenic mice

409

expressing human FcgRs exist (Smith et al., 2012), they are not on a congenic C57BL/6

410

background and have not been crossed to the K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. Future studies with

411

human FcgR mice, mouse-adapted strains of SARS-CoV-2 (Leist et al., 2020), and additional

412

human anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs may be useful for confirmation of the phenotypes described.

413

The requirement of Fc effector functions for protection by other anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs

414

warrants more study. Indeed, in vitro neutralization potency does not uniformly correlate with in

415

vivo protection (Schäfer et al., 2020). Our studies used neutralizing antibodies that bind the

416

RBD on S and block ACE2 receptor engagement (Zost et al., 2020b). Other neutralizing mAbs

417

against the N-terminal domain or some classes of non-neutralizing mAbs also may require Fc

418

effector functions for therapeutic activity. Even among anti-RBD mAbs, we observed variation,

419

as clinical protection with COV2-2381 and COV2-2072 was only partially Fc-dependent when

420

administered as post-exposure therapy at D+1, yet virological protection was lost with COV2-

421

2072 LALA-PG, but not COV2-2381 LALA administration. This result could be due to

422

differences in epitope binding or neutralization potency between different anti-RBD antibodies or

423

the angle of engagement and accessibility of the Fc region for C1q or FcgR binding. In

424

conclusion, our study highlights the contributions of Fc effector functions for therapeutic activity

425

of neutralizing mAbs through reductions in viral burden and/or immunopathology. Accordingly,

426

the design of antibody-based combinations against SARS-CoV-2 likely should optimize both

427

neutralization and Fc effector function activities to enhance the window of treatment and provide

428

the greatest virological and clinical protection.

METHOD DETAILS

739

MAb production and purification. COV2-2050, COV2-2381, COV2-2072, and COV2-

740

3025 were isolated from a B cell from a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patient and described

741

previously (Zost et al., 2020a; Zost et al., 2020b). mAb 2D22 was described previously

742

(Fibriansah et al., 2015). Sequences of mAbs that had been synthesized (Twist Bioscience) and

743

cloned into an IgG1 monocistronic expression vector (designated as pTwist-mCis_G1) or IgG1

744

monocistronic expression vector containing L234A, L235A, and P329G mutations in the Fc

745

region of the heavy chain (designated as pTwist-mCis_LALA-PG) were used for mAb secretion

746

in mammalian cell culture. This vector contains an enhanced 2A sequence and GSG linker that

747

allows the simultaneous expression of mAb heavy and light chain genes from a single construct

748

upon transfection (Chng et al., 2015). mAb proteins were produced after transient transfection

749

using the Gibco ExpiCHO Expression System (ThermoFisher Scientific) following the

750

manufacturer’s protocol. Culture supernatants were purified using HiTrap MabSelect SuRe

751

columns (Cytiva, formerly GE Healthcare Life Sciences) on an AKTA Pure chromatographer

752

(GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Purified mAbs were buffer-exchanged into PBS, concentrated

753

using Amicon Ultra-4 50-kDa centrifugal filter units (Millipore Sigma) and stored at -80 °C until

754

use. Purified mAbs were tested routinely for endotoxin levels (found to be less than 30 EU per

755

mg IgG). Endotoxin testing was performed using the PTS201F cartridge (Charles River), with a

756

sensitivity range from 10 to 0.1 EU per ml, and an Endosafe Nexgen-MCS instrument (Charles

757

River). Chinese hamster ovary cell expressed recombinant forms of COV2-2381 IgG1 or COV2-

758

2381 IgG1 containing L234A, L235A mutations in the Fc region of the heavy chain (COV2-2381-

759

LALA) were kindly provided by Ron Cobb, Ology Bioservices and Chris Earnhart, U.S. Joint

760

Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense.

761

Plaque forming assay. Vero-furin cells (Mukherjee et al., 2016) were seeded at a

762

density of 2.5×105 cells per well in flat-bottom 12-well tissue culture plates. The following day,

763

medium was removed and replaced with 200 μL of 10-fold serial dilutions of the material to be

764

titered, diluted in DMEM+2% FBS. One hours later, 1 mL of methylcellulose overlay was added.

765

Plates were incubated for 72 h, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (final concentration) in

766

phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min. Plates were stained with 0.05% (w/v) crystal violet in 20%

767

methanol and washed twice with distilled, deionized water.

768

Measurement of viral burden. Tissues were weighed and homogenized with zirconia

769

beads in a MagNA Lyser instrument (Roche Life Science) in 1000 μL of DMEM media

770

supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated FBS. Tissue homogenates were clarified by

771

centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and stored at −80°C. RNA was extracted using the

772

MagMax mirVana Total RNA isolation kit (Thermo Scientific) on the Kingfisher Flex extraction

773

robot (Thermo Scientific). RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using the TaqMan RNA-

774

to-CT 1-Step Kit (ThermoFisher). Reverse transcription was carried out at 48°C for 15 min

775

followed by 2 min at 95°C. Amplification was accomplished over 50 cycles as follows: 95°C for

776

15 s and 60°C for 1 min. Copies of SARS-CoV-2 N gene RNA in samples were determined

777

using a previously published assay (Case et al., 2020). Briefly, a TaqMan assay was designed

778

to

a Leica DFC7000T camera, or an Olympus BX51 microscope with attached camera.

817

Flow cytometry analysis of immune cell infiltrates. For analysis of BAL fluid, mice

818

were sacrificed by ketamine overdose, followed by cannulation of the trachea with a 19-G

819

canula. BAL was performed with three washes of 0.8 ml of sterile PBS. BAL fluid was

820

centrifuged, and single cell suspensions were generated for staining. Single cell suspensions of

821

BAL were preincubated with Fc Block antibody (BD PharMingen) in PBS + 2% heat-inactivated

822

FBS for 10 min at room temperature before staining. Cells were incubated with antibodies

823

against the following markers: AF700 anti-CD45 (clone 30 F-11), APC-Cy7 anti-CD11c (clone

824

N418), PE anti-Siglec F (clone E50-2440; BD), PE-Cy7 anti-Ly6G (clone 1A8), BV605 anti-Ly6C

825

(clone HK1.4; BioLegend), BV 711 anti-CD11b (clone M1/70), APC anti-CD103 (clone 2E7;

826

827

CD8 (clone53-6.7), anti-NK1.1 (clone PK136), and BV605 anti-TCR γ/δ (clone GL3). All

828

antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:200. Cells were stained for 20 min at 4°C, washed, fixed

829

and permeabilized for intracellular staining with Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set

830

(eBioscience) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were incubated overnight at 4°C

831

with PE-Cy5 anti-Foxp3 (clone FJK-16s), washed, re-fixed with 4% PFA (EMS) for 20 min and

832

resuspended in permeabilization buffer. Absolute cell counts were determined using Trucount

833

beads (BD). Flow cytometric data were acquired on a cytometer (BD-X20; BD Biosciences) and

840

administered to mice by intraperitoneal injection one day before infection and at D+1, D+3, D+5,

841

and D+7 relative to SARS-CoV-2 infection. For NK cell depletion, anti-NK1.1 (clone PK136; 200

842

843

intraperitoneal injection one day before infection and at D+1, D+3, D+5, and D+7 relative to

844

SARS-CoV-2 infection.

845

For analysis of immune cell depletion, peripheral blood was collected on the day of

846

harvest. Erythrocytes were lysed with ACK lysis buffer (Gibco) and resuspended in RPMI

847

supplemented with 10% FBS. For anti-Ly6G or anti-CCR2 depletion, single-cell suspensions

848

were preincubated with Fc Block antibody (BD PharMingen) in PBS + 2% heat-inactivated FBS

849

for 10 min at room temperature and then stained with antibodies against CD45 BUV395, CD11b

850

PE/Dazzle 594, Ly6C Pacific Blue, Ly6B FITC, Ly6G BV650, and fixable viability dye (eFluor

851

852

with antibodies against CD45 BUV395, CD19 BV711, CD3 BV711, NK1.1 FITC, and Nkp56

853

Pacific Blue.

854

Respiratory mechanics. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg

855

and 10 mg/kg, i.p., respectively). The trachea was isolated by dissection of the neck area and

856

cannulated using an 18-gauge blunt metal cannula (typical resistance of 0.18 cmH2O.s/mL),

857

which was secured in place with a nylon suture. The mouse then was connected to the flexiVent

858

computer-controlled piston ventilator (SCIREQ Inc.) via the cannula, which was attached to the

859

FX adaptor Y-tubing. Mechanical ventilation was initiated, and mice were given an additional

860

100 mg/kg of ketamine and 0.1 mg/mouse of the paralytic pancuronium bromide by

861

intraperitoneal route to prevent breathing efforts against the ventilator and during

862

measurements. Mice were ventilated using default settings for mice, which consisted in a

863

positive end expiratory pressure at 3 cm H2O, a 10 mL/kg tidal volume (Vt), a respiratory rate at

864

150 breaths per minute (bpm), and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.21 (i.e., room air).

865

Respiratory mechanics were assessed using the forced oscillation technique, as previously

866

described (McGovern et al., 2013), using the latest version of the flexiVent operating software

867

(flexiWare v8.1.3). Pressure-volume loops and measurements of inspiratory capacity also were

868

done.

869

Neutralization assay. Serial dilutions of mAbs were incubated with 102 focus-forming

870

units (FFU) of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at 37°C. mAb-virus complexes were added to Vero E6 cell

871

monolayers in 96-well plates and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Subsequently, cells were overlaid

872

with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in MEM supplemented with 2% FBS. Plates were harvested 30 h

873

later by removing overlays and fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min at room temperature.

874

Plates were washed and sequentially incubated with 1 μg/mL of a recombinant IgG based on

875

the sequence of CR3022 (Yuan et al., 2020) anti-S antibody and HRP-conjugated goat anti-

876

human IgG in PBS supplemented with 0.1% saponin and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. SARS-

877

CoV-2-infected cell foci were visualized using TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL) and

878

quantitated on an ImmunoSpot microanalyzer (Cellular Technologies).

879

RNA sequencing. cDNA libraries were constructed starting with 10 ng of total RNA from

880

lung tissues of each sample that was extracted using the MagMax Mirvana kit per

881

manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was generated using the Seqplex kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St.

882

Louis, MO) with amplification of 20 cycles. Library construction was performed using 100 ng of

883

cDNA undergoing end repair, A-tailing, ligation of universal TruSeq adapters, and 8 cycles of

884

amplification to incorporate unique dual index sequences. Libraries were sequenced on the

885

NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) targeting 40 million read pairs and extending 150

886

cycles with paired end reads. RNA-seq reads were aligned to the mouse Ensembl GRCh38.76

887

primary assembly and SARS-CoV-2 NCBI NC_045512 Wuhan-Hu-1 genome with STAR

888

program (version 2.5.1a) (Dobin et al., 2013). Gene counts were derived from the number of

889

uniquely aligned unambiguous reads by Subread:featureCount (version 1.4.6-p5) (Liao et al.,

890

2014). The ribosomal fraction, known junction saturation, and read distribution over known gene

891

models were quantified with RSeQC (version 2.6.2) (Liao et al., 2014). All gene counts were

892

preprocessed with the R package EdgeR (Robinson et al., 2010) to adjust samples for

893

differences in library size using the trimmed mean of M values (TMM) normalization procedure.

894

Viral and ribosomal genes and genes not expressed in at least five samples (the smallest group

895

size) at a level greater than or equal to 1 count per million reads were excluded, resulting

896

12,157 unique genes in further analysis. The R package limma (Ritchie et al., 2015) with

897

voomWithQualityWeights function (Liu et al., 2015) was utilized to calculate the weighted

898

likelihoods for all samples, based on the observed mean-variance relationship of every gene

899

and sample. Differentially expressed genes were defined as those with at least 2-fold difference

900

between two individual groups at the Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate (FDR)

901

(https://www.jstor.org/stable/2346101?seq=1) adjusted P value (i.e. q-value < 0.05).

902
903

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

904

Statistical significance was assigned when P values were < 0.05 using Prism version 8

905

(GraphPad). Tests, number of animals (n), median values, and statistical comparison groups

906

are indicated in the Figure legends. Analysis of weight change was determined by two-way

907

ANOVA. Changes in functional parameters or immune parameters were compared to isotype-

908

treated animals and were analyzed by one-way ANOVA or one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s test.
