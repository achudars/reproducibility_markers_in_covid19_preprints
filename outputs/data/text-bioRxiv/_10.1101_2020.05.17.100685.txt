Abstract
The COVID-2019 pandemic is the most severe acute public health threat of the twenty-first
century. To properly address this crisis with both robust testing and novel treatments, we
require a deep understanding of the life cycle of the causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus. Here, we examine the architecture and self-assembly properties of the SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid protein, which packages viral RNA into new virions. We determined a 1.4 Å
resolution crystal structure of this protein’s N2b domain, revealing a compact, intertwined
dimer similar to that of related coronaviruses including SARS-CoV. While the N2b domain forms
a dimer in solution, addition of the C-terminal spacer B/N3 domain mediates formation of a
homotetramer. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we find evidence that
at least part of this putatively disordered domain is structured, potentially forming an α-helix
that self-associates and cooperates with the N2b domain to mediate tetramer formation.
Finally, we map the locations of amino acid substitutions in the N protein from over 38,000
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. We find that these substitutions are strongly clustered in the
protein’s N2a linker domain, and that substitutions within the N1b and N2b domains cluster
away from their functional RNA binding and dimerization interfaces. Overall, this work reveals
the architecture and self-assembly properties of a key protein in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, with
implications for both drug design and antibody-based testing.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 1,2 is the third coronavirus to cross from an animal reservoir to infect humans in the
21st century, after SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) 3,4 and MERS (MiddleEast respiratory syndrome coronavirus) 5. Isolation and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 was reported
in January 2020, and the virus was found to be highly related to SARS and share a probable
origin in bats 2,6. Since its emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the virus has infected
about 7 million people and caused nearly 400,000 deaths as of early June, 2020
(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu). The high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and the worldwide spread of
this ongoing outbreak highlight the urgent need for public health measures and therapeutics to
limit new infections. Moreover, the severity of the atypical pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2
(COVID-2019), often requiring multi-week hospital stays and the use of invasive ventilators 7–9,
highlights the need for therapeutics to lessen the severity of individual infections.
Current therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 target major points in the life-cycle of the
virus. The antiviral Remdesivir, first developed against Ebola virus 10,11, inhibits the viral RNAdependent RNA polymerases of a range of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 12–14 and has
shown promise against SARS-CoV-2 in small-scale trials in both primates and humans 15,16.
Another target is the viral protease (Mpro/3CLpro), which is required to process viral
polyproteins into their active forms 17. Finally, the transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein
mediates binding to host cells through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and
transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) proteins, and mediates fusion of the viral and
host cell membranes 18–21. As the most prominent surface component of the virus, the spike
protein is the major target of antibodies in patients, and is the focus of several current efforts
at SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. Initial trials using antibody-containing plasma of
convalescent COVID-19 patients has also shown promise in lessening the severity of the disease
22
.
While the above efforts target viral entry, RNA synthesis, and protein processing, there has so
far been less emphasis on other steps in the viral life cycle. One critical step in coronavirus
replication is the assembly of the viral genomic RNA and nucleocapsid (N) protein into a
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which in betacoronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 is thought to
form a helical filament structure that is packaged into virions through interactions with the
membrane-spanning membrane (M) protein 23–28. Despite its location within the viral particle
rather than on its surface, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show higher and earlier antibody
responses to the nucleocapsid protein than the surface spike protein 29,30. As such, a better
understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein’s structure, and structural differences between it
and N proteins of related coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, may aid the development of
sensitive and specific immunological tests.
Coronavirus N proteins possess a shared domain structure with an N-terminal RNA-binding
domain and a C-terminal domain responsible for dimerization. The assembly of N protein
dimers into higher-order complexes is not well understood, but likely involves cooperative
interactions between the dimerization domain and other regions of the protein, plus the bound
RNA 31–39. Here, we present a high-resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 N dimerization
domain, revealing an intertwined dimer similar to that of related betacoronaviruses. We also

analyze the self-assembly properties of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, and show that higher-order
assembly requires both the dimerization domain and the extended, disordered C-terminus of
the protein. Together with other work revealing the structure and RNA-binding properties of
the nucleocapsid N-terminal domain, these results lay the groundwork for a comprehensive
understanding of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid assembly and architecture.
Results
Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid dimerization domain
Betacoronavirus nucleocapsid (N) proteins share a common overall domain structure, with
ordered RNA-binding (N1b) and dimerization (N2b) domains separated by short regions with
high predicted disorder (N1a, N2a, and spacer B/N3; Figure 1A). Self-association of the fulllength SARS-CoV N protein and the isolated C-terminal region (domains N2b plus spacer B/N3;
residues 210-422) was first demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid analysis 31, and the purified fulllength protein was shown to self-associate into predominantly dimers in solution 32. The
structures of the N2b domain of SARS-CoV and several related coronaviruses confirmed the
obligate homodimeric structure of this domain 33–39, and other work showed that the region Cterminal to this domain mediates further self-association into tetramer, hexamer, and
potentially higher oligomeric forms 40–42. Other studies have suggested that the protein’s Nterminal region, including the RNA-binding N1b domain, can also self-associate 43,44,
highlighting the possibility that assembly of full-length N into helical filaments is mediated by
cooperative interactions among several interfaces.
To characterize the structure and self-assembly properties of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, we
first cloned and purified the protein’s N2b dimerization domain (N2b; residues 247-364) 45,46. We
crystallized and determined two high-resolution crystal structures of N2b; a 1.45 Å resolution
structure of His6-tagged N2b at pH 8.5, and a 1.42 Å resolution structure of N2b after His6-tag
cleavage, at pH 4.5 (see Materials and Methods and Table S1). These structures reveal a
compact, tightly intertwined dimer with a central four-stranded β-sheet comprising the bulk of
the dimer interface (Figure 1B). This interface is composed of two β-strands and a short α-helix
from each protomer that extend toward the opposite protomer and pack against its
hydrophobic core. The asymmetric units of both structures contain two N2b dimers, giving four
crystallographically independent views of the N2b dimer. These four dimers differ only slightly,
showing overall Cα r.m.s.d values of 0.15-0.19 Å and with most variation arising from loop
regions (Figure S1A). Our structures also overlay closely with three other recently-deposited
structures of the SARS-CoV-2 N2b domain (PDB IDs 6WJI, 6YUN, and 7C22; all unpublished).
One of these structures (PDB ID 7C22) was crystallized in equivalent conditions as our structure
of untagged N2b. Including all of these structures, there are now eight independent
crystallographic views of the SARS-CoV-2 N2b domain dimer (16 total protomers) in four crystal
forms at pH 4.5, 7.5, 7.8, and 8.5. All of these structures overlay closely, with an overall Cα
r.m.s.d of 0.15-0.31 Å (Figure S1A).
The structure of N2b closely resembles that of related coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV,
Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), MERS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63 33–38. The structure is particularly

similar to that of SARS-CoV, with which the N2b domain shares 96% sequence identity; only five
residues differ between these proteins’ N2b domains (SARS-CoV Gln268  SARS-CoV-2 A267,
D291E290, H335Thr334, Gln346Asn345, and Asn350Gln349), and the structures are
correspondingly similar with an overall Cα r.m.s.d of 0.44 Å across the N2b dimer (Figure 1C).
A crystal structure of the SARS-CoV N protein revealed a helical assembly of N2b domain dimers
that was proposed as a possible structure for the observed helical nucleocapsid filaments in
virions 33. We therefore examined the packing of N2b domain dimers in the five crystal
structures of SARS-CoV-2 N, four of which show distinct space groups and unit cell parameters.
We identified two dimer-dimer packing modes that are observed in four or all five structures,
respectively (Figure S1B). These packing modes do not result in the assembly of a helical
filament, and do not strongly correlate with highly conserved surfaces on the N2b domain. This
evidence, combined with our finding that N2b forms solely dimers in solution (see below),
suggests that packing of N2b domain dimers does not underlie higher-order assembly of SARSCoV-2 N protein filaments.
N protein variation in SARS-CoV-2 patient samples
Since the first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported in January 2020 2,6, over 38,000
full genomic sequences have been deposited in public databases (as of June 4, 2020). To
examine the variability of the N protein in these sequences, we downloaded a comprehensive
list of reported mutations within the SARS-CoV-2 N gene in a set of 38,318 genome sequences
from the China National Center for Bioinformation, 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource. Among
these sequences, there are 10,983 instances of amino acid substitutions spread across 250 of
the 419 amino acids of the N protein (Figure 2A, Table S2). These variants are strongly
clustered in the N2a linker domain, particularly in the serine/arginine-rich subdomain (SR in
Figure 2A). The most common substitutions are R203K and G204R, which occur together as the
result of a common trinucleotide substitution in genomic positions 28881-28883, from GGG to
AAC (~4,100 of the 38,318 sequences in our dataset; Figure S2A-B). While positions 203 and
204 accounted for over two-thirds of the total individual amino acid substitutions in this
dataset, the N2a region shows a strong enrichment of mutations even when these positions are
not considered (Figure 2A). In contrast to the enrichment of missense mutations in the N2a
domain, synonymous mutations were distributed relatively equally throughout the protein
(Figure S2C). Thus, these data suggest that the N2a domain is uniquely tolerant of mutations, in
keeping with its likely structural role as a disordered linker between the RNA-binding N1b
domain and the N2b dimerization domain.
While the majority of N protein mutations are in the N2a domain, we nonetheless identified
345 instances of amino acid variants in the RNA-binding N1b domain, and 315 instances in the
N2b domain. We mapped these onto high-resolution structures of both domains (Figure 2B-C).
Two high-resolution crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 N1b domain have been determined
(PDB ID 6M3M and 6VYO) 47, and a recent NMR study determined a solution structure of the
domain and defined its likely RNA binding surface (Figure 2B) 48. In keeping with its functional
importance, the identified RNA binding surface shows only a single mutation in this dataset
(Figure 2B; middle panel). In the N2b domain, most mutations occur on surface residues,

particularly in loop regions, while the functionally-important dimer interface is largely invariant
(Figure 2C).
Finally, the 38,318 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences contain nine sequences with reported
nonsense/premature stop codons in the N protein. Two of these are located at position 256
within the N2b domain, while the remaining seven are located in the spacer B/N3 region
between positions 372-418 (Figure 2A).
Self-association of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein
Our structures of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein N2b domain reveal that, as in related
coronaviruses, this domain mediates homodimer formation. We next systematically
investigated the molecular basis for higher-order self-assembly of the SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid. We first purified the full-length N protein (NFL) for analysis of its oligomeric state.
While our initial attempts at purification yielded large aggregates significantly contaminated
with nucleic acid (Figure S3A), purification of the protein in high-salt buffer (1M NaCl) and in
the presence of both DNase and RNase yielded pure NFL (Figure S3B). Using size exclusion
chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS), we determined that NFL
on its own assembles into a homotetramer in solution (Figure 3A).
To determine the molecular basis for homotetramer assembly, we purified a series of
truncation constructs encompassing the ordered N1b and N2b domains and their associated
linker domains (N1a, N2a, and spacer B/N3; Figure 1A). We characterized four truncations
encompassing the protein’s N-terminal regions, including N1ab (residues 2-175), N1b (residues
49-175), N1ab2a (residues 2-246), and N1b2a (residues 49-246). All four of these truncations are
monomeric in solution as determined by SEC-MALS (Figure 3B-C, Figure S3C-D). We next
analyzed N2b, which forms a homodimer in our crystal structures. As expected, N2b is dimeric
in solution (Figure 3D).
Finally, we analyzed the contribution of the C-terminal spacer B/N3 region to N protein selfassembly. Prior work with the Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV) N protein showed that this region
can, on its own, incorporate into nucleocapsid structures that lack the associated Membrane
(M) protein, suggesting that the region mediates a homotypic interaction between N proteins
46
. Other work with SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E N proteins also found that the C-terminal spacer
B/N3 region is required for higher-order assembly of tetramers and larger oligomers 40–42. We
purified a construct encoding N2b and the spacer B/N3 region (N2b3, residues 247-419) and
found that it forms a homotetramer (Figure 3E). We also analyzed self-assembly of the spacer
B/N3 region on its own by performing SEC-MALS analysis on this isolated region (N3, residues
365-419) fused to a His6-maltose binding protein (MBP) tag. Initial purification of His6-MBP-N3
yielded two peaks on the final size exclusion column, which we separated pooled and analyzed
by SEC-MALS. We found that these two peaks correspond to a monomer and a dimer,
respectively (Figure 3F). The pooled dimer population also showed a small population of
potentially higher-order oligomers (Figure 3F). Together, these data suggest that assembly of
betacoronavirus N protein filaments likely proceeds through at least three steps, each mediated
by different oligomerization interfaces: (1) dimerization mediated by the N2b domain; (2)
tetramerization mediated by the spacer B/N3 region (Figure 3G-H); and (3) oligomer/filament

assembly mediated by cooperative RNA binding and potential higher-order self-association of N
homotetramers.
To gain structural insight into how the spacer B/N3 region mediates N protein self-association,
we performed hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) on N2b and N2b3
(Figure 4). By probing the rate of exchange of amide hydrogen atoms with deuterium atoms in
a D2O solvent, HDX-MS provides information on the level of secondary structure and solvent
accessibility across an entire protein. We found that H-D exchange rates within N2b largely
agreed with our crystal structure: regions in β-strands or α-helices showed low exchange rates
consistent with high order, while loop regions showed increased exchange rates consistent with
their likely flexibility (Figure 4A, C, D).
Compared to N2b, N2b3 contains an additional 56 amino acids (residues 365-419). While residues
360-394 were not detected in our HDX-MS analysis, we detected spectra for seven overlapping
peptides spanning residues 395-419 at the protein’s extreme C-terminus (Figure 4B). While all
of these peptides exhibited higher levels of exchange than the ordered N2b domain, peptides
spanning the N-terminal part of this region (particularly residues 395-402) showed a degree of
protection compared to those at the extreme C-terminus (residues 404-419; Figure 4E). This
finding suggests that at least part of the spacer B/N3 domain possesses secondary structure
and may mediate N2b3 tetramer formation. Indeed, analysis by the PSI-PRED server 49 suggests
that this region may adopt an α-helical conformation (Figure 1A).
We next compared HDX-MS exchange rates of N2b versus N2b3 for peptides within the N2b
domain. We reasoned that if the C-terminus of N2b3 mediates tetramer formation, it may do so
by docking against a surface in the N2b domain, which may be detectable by reduced
deuterium uptake in the involved region. Contrary to this expectation, we found that the H-D
exchange rates within the N2b domain were nearly identical between the two constructs,
varying at most 2% in fractional deuterium uptake in individual peptides (Figure 4B, D). While
these data do not rule out the possibility that the spacer B/N3 region docks against N2b, they
nonetheless support our SEC-MALS data showing that spacer B/N3 independently selfassociates to mediate N protein tetramer formation. Further supporting this idea, His6-MBP-N3
did not detectably bind N2b in an in vitro pulldown assay using purified proteins (Figure S4B).

Discussion
Given the severity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a deep understanding of the SARS-CoV-2
life cycle is urgently needed. Here, we examine the architecture and self-assembly properties of
the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, a key player in viral replication responsible for packaging
viral RNA into new virions. Through two high-resolution crystal structures, we show that this
protein’s N2b domain forms a compact, strand-swapped dimer similar to that of related
betacoronaviruses. While the N2b domain mediates dimer formation, we find that addition of
the C-terminal spacer B/N3 domain mediates formation of a robust homotetramer. Finally, the
full-length N protein assembles into tetramers on its own and large oligomers in the presence
of nucleic acid, likely assembling through cooperative protein-protein interactions involving
several regions of the protein, plus interactions mediated by nucleic acids.
Given the importance of nucleocapsid-mediated RNA packaging to the viral life cycle, small
molecules that inhibit nucleocapsid self-assembly or mediate aberrant assembly may be
effective at reducing the severity of infections and the infectivity of patients. The high
resolution of our crystal structures will enable their use in virtual screening efforts to identify
such nucleocapsid assembly modulators. Given the high conservation of the N2b domain in
betacoronaviruses, these assembly modulators may also be effective at countering related
viruses including SARS-CoV. As SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be the last betacoronavirus to jump
from an animal reservoir to humans, the availability of such treatments could drastically alter
the course of future epidemics.
The SARS-CoV-2 genome has been subject to unprecedented scrutiny, with over 38,000
individual genome sequences deposited in public databases as of early June, 2020. We used this
set of genome sequences to identify over 10,000 instances of amino acid substitutions in the N
protein, and showed that these variants are strongly clustered in the protein’s N2a linker
domain. The ~650 substitutions we identified in the N1b and N2b domains were clustered away
from these domains’ RNA binding and dimerization interfaces, reflecting the functional
importance of these surfaces. Curiously, the identification of several nonsense mutations in the
protein’s spacer B/N3 region suggests that this region may not be absolutely required for viral
replication; this idea remains to be experimentally validated.
Given the early and strong antibody responses to the nucleocapsid displayed by SARS-CoV-2
infected patients, the distribution of mutations within this protein should be carefully
considered as antibody-based tests are developed. The high variability of the N2a domain
means that individual patient antibodies targeting this domain may not be reliably detected
with tests using the reference N protein; especially if these antibodies recognize residues 203
and 204, which are mutated in a large fraction of infections. At the same time, patient
antibodies targeting the conserved N1b and N2b domains may in fact cross-react with
nucleocapsids of related coronaviruses like SARS-CoV. The availability of a panel of purified N
protein constructs now makes it possible to systematically examine the epitopes of both
patient-derived and commercial anti-nucleocapsid antibodies.

Materials and Methods
Cloning and Protein Purification
SARS-CoV-2 N protein constructs (NFL (residues 2-419), N1ab (2-175), N1ab2a (2-246), N1b (49-175),
N1b2a (49-246), N2b (247-364), N2b3 (247-419)) were amplified by PCR from the IDT 2019-nCoV N
positive control plasmid (IDT cat. # 10006625; NCBI RefSeq YP_009724397) and inserted by
ligation-independent cloning into UC Berkeley Macrolab vector 2B-T (AmpR, N-terminal His6fusion; Addgene #29666) for expression in E. coli. N3 (residues 365-419) was similarly inserted
into UC Berkeley Macrolab vector 2C-T (AmpR, N-terminal His6-MBP fusion; Addgene #29706).
Plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain Rosetta 2(DE3) pLysS (Novagen), and grown in the
presence of ampicillin and chloramphenical to an OD600 of 0.8 at 37°C, induced with 0.25 mM
IPTG, then grown for a further 16 hours at 18°C prior to harvesting by centrifugation. Harvested
cells were resuspended in buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2 10% glycerol, 5 mM βmercaptoethanol, 1 mM NaN3) plus 500 mM NaCl and 5 mM imidazole pH 8.0. For purification,
cells were lysed by sonication, then clarified lysates were loaded onto a Ni2+ affinity column (NiNTA Superflow; Qiagen), washed in buffer A plus 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole pH 8.0,
and eluted in buffer A plus 300 mM NaCl and 400 mM imidazole. For cleavage of His6-tags,
proteins were buffer exchanged in centrifugal concentrators (Amicon Ultra, EMD Millipore) to
buffer A plus 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole, then incubated 16 hours at 4°C with TEV
protease 50. Cleavage reactions were passed through a Ni2+ affinity column again to remove
uncleaved protein, cleaved His6-tags, and His6-tagged TEV protease. Proteins were
concentrated in centrifugal concentrators and purified by size-exclusion chromatography
(Superdex 200; GE Life Sciences) in gel filtration buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5
mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT). Purified proteins were concentrated and stored at 4°C for
analysis.
SEC-MALS
For size exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS), 100 µL
purified proteins at 2-5 mg/mL were injected onto a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column
(GE Life Sciences) in gel filtration buffer. Light scattering and refractive index profiles were
collected by miniDAWN TREOS and Optilab T-rEX detectors (Wyatt Technology), respectively,
and molecular weight was calculated using ASTRA v. 6 software (Wyatt Technology).
HDX-MS
H-D exchange experiments were conducted with a Waters Synapt G2S system. 5 µL samples
containing 10 µM protein in gel filtration buffer were mixed with 55 µL of the same buffer
made with D2O for several deuteration times (0 sec, 1 min, 2 min, 5 min, 10 min) at 15°C. The
exchange was quenched for 2 min at 1°C with an equal volume of quench buffer (3M guanidine
HCl, 0.1% formic acid). Proteins were cleaved with pepsin and separated by reverse-phase
chromatography, then directed into a Waters SYNAPT G2s quadrupole time-of-flight (qTOF)
mass spectrometer. Peptides were identified using PLGS version 2.5 (Waters, Inc.), deuterium
uptake was calculated using DynamX version 2.0 (Waters Corp.), and uptake was corrected for
back-exchange using DECA 51. Uptake plots were generated in Prism version 8.

For crystallization of untagged N2b, protein (40 mg/mL) in crystallization buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl

with well solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 50 mM Ammonium Sulfate, and 38% PEG
3350 at 20°C in hanging drop format. Both untagged and His6-tagged N2b formed large shardlike crystals, and were frozen in liquid nitrogen directly from the crystallization drop without
further cryoprotection.
Diffraction data were collected at beamline 24ID-E at the Advanced Photon Source. Diffraction
datasets were processed with the RAPD pipeline (https://github.com/RAPD/RAPD/), which uses
XDS 52 for indexing and data reduction, and the CCP4 programs AIMLESS 53 and TRUNCATE 54 for
scaling and conversion to structure factors. The structure of untagged N2b was determined by
molecular replacement in PHASER 55 using a dimer of the SARS-CoV N2b domain (PDB ID 2GIB)
34
as a template. The resulting model was manually rebuilt in COOT 56 and refined in
phenix.refine 57 using positional, isotropic B-factor, and TLS (one group per chain) refinement.
The structure of His6-tagged N2b was determined by molecular replacement from the structure
of untagged N2b, then manually rebuilt and refined as above. Data collection statistics,
refinement statistics, and database accession numbers for diffraction data and final structures
can be found in Table S1. All structural figures were generated with PyMOL version 2.3.
Nickel pulldown
Nickel pulldown assays were performed in buffer A plus 300 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole pH
8.0. Ten µg bait (His6-MBP-N3) was mixed with equal weights of each prey protein in 50 µl total
reaction volume and incubated on ice for 30 minutes (5 µl “load” sample removed). 30 µl of a
50% slurry of Ni-NTA Superflow beads (Qiagen) was added and the mixture was incubated with
occasional mixing on ice for 30 minutes. Beads were washed three times with 1 mL buffer, then
bound proteins were eluted with the addition of 30 µl buffer A plus 300 mM NaCl and 250 mM
imidazole pH 8.0. Ten µl of each eluate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE alongside the load samples.
Bioinformatics
To examine variation in SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we downloaded a list of variants in the N gene
in 38,318 genome sequences from China National Center for Bioinformation, 2019 Novel
Coronavirus Resource (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov?lang=en; downloaded June 3, 2020). We
tabulated all mis-sense and nonsense mutations, and graphed the number of amino acid
variants at each codon in Prism version 8 (all variant frequencies are listed in Table S2). To
examine the prevalence of the trinucleotide substitution at genome positions 28881-28883, we
downloaded a set of 200 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the NCBI Virus Resource:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?SeqType_s=Nucleotide&VirusLineage_ss
=SARS-CoV-2,%20taxid:2697049). We selected genomes with and without the substitution to
show in Figure S2A. We used the NextStrain database 58 to visualize the prevalence of the N
protein G204R mutation, which is diagnostic of the GGGAAC trinucleotide substitution in
positions 28881-28883. To visualize SARS-CoV-2 clade identity, we used the URL
“https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global?c=clade_membership&l=unrooted”. To color by N protein

Figure 2. N protein variability in SARS-CoV-2 patient sequences
(A) Top: Plot showing the number of observed amino acid variants at each position in the N gene in 16,975 SARSCoV-2 genomes (details in Table S2). The most highly-mutated positions are R203 and G204, which are each
mutated more than 4,000 times due to a prevalent trinucleotide substitution (Figure S2A-B). Red tick marks
indicate the locations of seven premature stop mutations detected (two sequences contained stop codons at
residue 256; not graphed). Bottom: Plots showing amino acid variants in the N1b and N2b domains.

Figure 3. The C-terminus of N mediates tetramer formation
(A) Size exclusion chromatography (Superose 6) coupled to multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis of fulllength SARS-CoV-2 N. The measured MW of 190.0 kDa closely matches that of a tetramer (182.5 kDa). See Figure
S3B for SDS-PAGE analysis of all purified proteins.
(B) Size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 Increase; used for panels B-F) coupled to multi-angle light
scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis of SARS-CoV-2 N1ab (residues 2-175). The measured MW of 20.8 kDa closely
matches that of a monomer (18.9 kDa). dRI: differential refractive index.
(C) SEC-MALS analysis of SARS-CoV-2 N1ab2a (residues 2-246). The measured MW of 25.0 kDa is slightly less than
that of a monomer (26.2 kDa), reflecting partial proteolysis within the N2a domain (Figure S3B).
(D) SEC-MALS analysis of SARS-CoV-2 N2b. The measured MW (31.5 kDa) closely matches that of a homodimer
(26.5 kDa).
(E) SEC-MALS analysis of SARS-CoV-2 N2b3. The measured MW (75.6 kDa) closely matches that of a homotetramer
(77.4 kDa).
(F) SEC-MALS analysis of MBP-SARS-CoV-2 N3 (“peak 1” black/dark blue; “peak 2” gray/light blue) The measured
MW of peak 1 (101.9 kDa) and peak 2 (48.9 kDa) closely match those of a homodimer (101.7 kDa) and a monomer
(50.9 kDa). The small peak at 10.5 mL suggests higher-order self-assembly.
(G) Schematic summary of size exclusion and SEC-MALS results on N protein constructs. See Figure S3C-D for SECMALS analysis of N1b (residues 49-174) and N1b2a (residues 49-246).
(H) Proposed self-assembly mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 N. Dimerization is mediated by the N2b domain, and these
dimers self-associate through the N3 region to form homotetramers.

Figure 4. HDX-MS analysis of N2b and N2b3
(A) Schematic showing the N2b sequence and structure, plus protein regions detected by HDX-MS. Each peptide is
colored by its fractional deuterium uptake during the course of the experiment (blue-white-magenta = 0-100%
fractional uptake).
(B) Schematic showing the N2b3 sequence and inferred structure (the α-helix spanning residues 400-416 is
predicted by PSI-PRED), plus protein regions detected by HDX-MS. Two sets of exchange rates are shown:
fractional deuterium uptake in N2b3 (upper box) colored as in panel A, and relative uptake comparing N2b and N2b3
(lower box).
(C) Structure of the N2b dimer, with one monomer colored by fractional deuterium uptake (blue-white-magenta =
0-75% fractional uptake).
(D) Uptake plots for two peptides within the ordered N2b domain, with uptake in N2b indicated in blue and uptake
in N2b3 indicated in green. The peptide covering residues 323-329 (located within a loop) is relatively exposed,
while the peptide covering residues 330-336 (within a β-strand) is strongly protected from H-D exchange.
(E) Uptake plots for three peptides in the C-terminal region of N2b3, plotted by fractional deuterium uptake.
Peptides covering residues 395-402 (yellow) and 403-411 (red) show more protection than residues 404-419,
suggesting that this region is partially structured. See Figure S4A for each peptide plotted by absolute deuterium
uptake.

Figure S1. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 N2b domain structures
(A) Overlay of eight independent views of the SARS-CoV-2 N2b domain dimer, including the two structures
determined in this work (dimer 1=untagged N2b chains A+B; dimer 2=untagged N2b chains C+D, dimer 3=His6tagged N2b chains A+B, dimer 4=His6-tagged N2b chains C+D), and two recently-deposited structures of the same
domain (PDB ID 6WJI dimer 5=chains A+B, dimer 6=chains C+D, dimer 7=chains E+F; 6YUN dimer 8). A third
deposited structure (PDB ID 7C22) has equivalent crystal packing as our structure of untagged N2b, so is not
included in this analysis. The overall Cα r.m.s.d values of all dimers overlaid on dimer 1 are shown at bottom.

Figure S3. Purification and characterization of N protein constructs
(A) Size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 Increase) of NFL protein purified with contaminating nucleic acid,
as indicated by an A260/A280 ratio of 1.6. When bound to nucleic acid, NFL assembles into a large oligomer.
(B) SDS-PAGE analysis of purified SARS-CoV-2 N protein constructs: NFL (residues 2-419), N1ab (2-175), N1ab2a (2-246),
N2b (247-364), N2b3 (247-419), N1b (49-174), N1b2a (49-246), and maltose binding protein (MBP)-fused N3 (364-419).
N1ab2a shows evidence of proteolytic cleavage within the N2a region during purification. N1b2a also possesses the
N2a domain and shows evidence of proteolytic cleavage, but we could separate the cleaved and uncleaved
fragments for analysis.
(C) SEC-MALS analysis of SARS-CoV-2 N1b (residues 49-175). The measured MW of 14.0 kDa closely matches that of
a monomer (13.9 kDa).
