Abtsract
The emergence and rapid dissemination worldwide of a novel Coronavirus (SARSCoV-2) results in decrease of swabs availability for clinical samples collection, as well
as, reagents for RT-qPCR diagnostic kits considered a confirmatory test for COVID-19
infection. This scenario, showed the requirement of improve de diagnostic capacity, so
the aim of this study were to verify the possibility of reducing the reaction volume of
RT-qPCR and to test cotton swabs as alternative for sample collection. RT-qPCR
volumes and RNA sample concentration were optimized without affecting the
sensitivity of assays, using both probe-based and intercalation dyes methods. Although
rayon swabs showed better performance, cotton swabs could be used as alternative type
for clinical sample collection. COVID-19 laboratory diagnosis is important to isolate
and restrict the dissemination of virus, so seek for alternatives to decrease the coast of
assays improve the control of disease.

Introduction
On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified

about cases of severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China (WHO, 2020a). The etiological agent
was identified as a coronavirus (Coronaviridae: Betacoronavirus: Sarbecovirus: Severe
acute

respiratory

syndrome-related

coronavirus)

named

as

SARS-CoV-2

(GORBALENYA et al., 2020; LU et al., 2020a) and the disease denominated as
COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) (WHO, 2020b). Confirmed cases are currently
peaking in Latin America and, for instance, on June 13th 2020, more than 850,000 cases
had been confirmed in Brazil (available in https://covid.saude.gov.br/).
The diagnostic test recommended for SARS-CoV-2 is a Real-Time Polymerase
Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR), which can detect active infection by detection of viral
genome. Collection of only nasopharyngeal samples (1 swab used for both nostrils) or
combined with oropharyngeal (1 swab) sample, should be made with synthetic fibers
swabs as more reliable due to a lesser interference with the downstream reactions (CDC,
2020a). Protocols with primers and probes designed at the Charité Virology Institute,
Berlin (CORMAN et al., 2020) or at the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC,2020b; LU et al., 2020b) became one of the standard procedures for SARS-CoV2 detection.
With the increasing demand for RT-qPCR tests for both patients and population
screening, there is an ongoing shortage of both RT-qPCR reagents and rayon swabs;
besides, the relatively high costs of these consumables for poor countries pose a barrier
for a wider use of testing. This manuscript reports on the optimization of the Charité
and the CDC RT-qPCR protocols for SARS-CoV-2 detection regarding concentration
and volumes of reagents for both probe and intercalant agent-based platforms, as well as
on the substitution of rayon swabs for cotton swabs for sample collection.

Materials and Methods and Results
2.1 Probe protocol: optimization of reaction volume and sample concentration
An inactivated SARS-CoV-2 isolate (kindly provided by Prof. Edison L.

Durigon, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São Paulo, Brazil) was used
for total RNA extraction with QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN).
Total RNA concentrations of 10 and 20% for final reactions of 20, 15 and10 µL,
were tested using AgPath-ID One Step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems™) and
StepOne™ Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems™), with primers and probes
for the RdRp and E genes (CORMAN et al., 2020). Amplification conditions were 48
ºC/20 min (reverse transcription), 95 ºC/10 min (for the activation of the DNA
polymerase) followed by 45 cycles at 95 ºC/ 10 seconds and 60 ºC/ 30 seconds.
Though the different total RNA concentrations resulted in 1 Cq difference, no
difference was found for the three final reaction volumes (Table 1).

Performance of E and RdRp genes of SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCRs, based on final
reaction volume of 10 µL with 2 µL of RNA (Table 1), were verified with a relative
standard curve built with 10-2 to 10-8 dilutions of positive RNA control. Respectively for

E and RdRp genes, detection were observed until 10-6 (Cq mean= 33.71, E= 91.2% and
r2= 0.998) and 10-5 dilutions (Cq mean= 31.98, E= 96.82% and r2= 0.998). This lower
sensitivity for RdRp gene is possibly a consequence of a lower transcription of the
corresponding ORF due to a 3-to-5’ attenuation (IRIGOYEN et al., 2016). So, the
results showed that the final volume does not interfere with the sensitivity of this assay.
The kits GoTaq® probe 1-Step RT-qPCR (Promega) and SuperScript III
Platinum One-Step RT-PCR System (ThermoFisher Scientific) were also tested for the
final reaction volumes of 15 and 10 µL, as per manufacturer’s instructions, in a 7500
Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems™), and the same results were found when
compared to the AgPath-ID One Step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems™).
For the CDC protocol (LU et al., 2020b), 2019-nCoV CDC-qualified Probe and
Primer for SARS-CoV-2 kit (Biosearch™ Technologies), which includes primers and
probes for SARS-CoV-2 N gene (N1 and N2) and Human RNase P (endogen control),
were tested with final reaction volume of 20 and 10 µL with 25% concentration of total
RNA, using AgPath-ID One Step RT-PCR (Applied Biosystems™) and StepOne™ RealTime PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems™). Same conditions and relative standard
curve (10-2 to 10-8) were used with E gene reaction (CORMAN et al., 2020) to possibly
the comparison between assays performances.
All reactions resulted in adequate efficiencies and r2 values (Table 2) and
detected the targets up to the 10-8 dilution (Table 2), though the N2 reaction resulted in a
more intense fluorescence for the higher dilutions, allowing an easier visualization of
amplification. The difference between the sensitivities of this last test with the
previously described for the Charité RdRp and E genes protocol is possibly due to
different positive control aliquots used.

2.2 Intercalating dyes: optimization of primers concentration
For the intercalating dyes system, primers targeting human RNAse P, as per the
CDC protocol (LU et al., 2020b), were used at 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 nM each. For
E and RdRp genes from the Charité protocol (CORMAN et al., 2020), primers were
tested at 100 and 200 nM and 100, 200, 300 and 400 nM, respectively.
Reactions were carried out with Power SYBR® Green RNA to Ct 1-Step kit
(Applied Biosystems™) using a StepOne™ and 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied
Biosystems™) equipment, using 3 or 2 µL of RNA for 15 and 10 µL final volume
reactions, respectively. Cycling conditions were 48 ºC/20 min (reverse transcription), 95
ºC/10 min (for the activation of the DNA polymerase) followed by 45 cycles at 95 ºC/
10 seconds and 60 ºC/ 30 seconds and melt curve analyses (95 ºC/15 secs, 60 ºC/15 secs
and 95 ºC/15 secs).
For the RNAse P, the 100 nM primers reaction was found as more efficient
(E=101.8%; r2=0.991), with a specific peak at 81 ºC in the melt curve; at higher primers
concentrations, primers dimers were detected in melt curve analysis and at 50 nM there
was a loss in sensitivity.
E gene reaction was fond as sensitive as the probe-based reaction for this target,
being able to detect up to 10-6 dilution of positive RNA control with primers at both 100
and 200 nM, with a unique melting peak at 77 ºC. At 200 nM primers concentration,
though, a higher efficiency was found (E= 99.3 % and r2=0.998), as well as an earlier
target detection for the 10-6 dilution (Cq mean= 32.53 and 30.07, respectively, for 100
and 200 nM).
The RdRp reaction showed insufficient performance, as, with primers at 200 nM
there was a loss in sensitivity, while, at 400 nM the sensitivity was equal to the probe-

based reaction (detection up to 10-5 dilution), but efficiency could not be evaluated due
to primer dimers formation visualized in melt curve analysis.

2.3 Comparison between cotton and rayon swabs
An inactivated SARS-CoV-2 isolate was 2-fold diluted in sterile saline from 2-1
to 2-9 in 100 µL, in duplicate. For each respective dilution, one rayon (Inlab Diagnóstica,
Brazil) and one cotton (Labor, Brazil) swab, both with plastic stalks, were dipped into
the tube (one swab/tube), being all the content absorbed by the swabs. Undiluted SARSCoV-2 (20) was also included, as well as sterile saline (negative control).
Next, each swab was immersed in a conical tube containing 3 mL sterile saline
and kept at 2-8 ºC for 72 hours, in order to mirror the clinical flow of clinical samples.
All swabs were finally submitted to RNA extraction and tested with the probe-based E
gene RT-qPCR protocol.
Rayon swabs showed more consistency results, with detection through all
dilutions from 20 to 2-9 linearly (Table 4), while cotton swabs failed to detect in two
dilutions (2-5 and 2-6). CDC does not recommend the use of calcium arginate swabs and
swabs with wooden shafts, because these material types may contain PCR inhibitors,
and indicate only use of synthetic fibers swabs for collection of clinical samples (CDC,
2020a). However, some study showed good performance of cotton swabs for detection
of Human norovirus and rhinovirus by RT-qPCR (WARIS et al., 2013; LEE et al.,
2018). Both cotton and rayon swabs have the same chemical structure, with O-H groups
which form hydrogen bonds with nucleic acids, and showed optimal absorption capacity
(above 100 µL), but low extraction and recovery efficiency (BRUIJNS, 2018).
Although the amplification have been failed in some dilutions, in lower and higher

swabs for clinical sample collection.

Conclusions
The consequences of the ongoing shortage of rayon swabs and RT-qPCR

reagents on the sampling and testing of COVID-19 suspected persons will surely have a
negative impact on the control of the disease due to a lower sampling and a higher sub
notification rate. Here, we demonstrated that the decrease of reaction volume not
interferes in sensitivity of assays, allowing the diagnostic capacity increase, and a
choice of the type of swab must be based in the local availability and the urgency of the
sampling and testing.
