Spinal epidural abscess: the importance of early
diagnosis and treatment
A R Mackenzie, R B S Laing, C C Smith, G F Kaar, F W Smith

Abstract
Objectives—To remind clinicians of the
dangers of delayed diagnosis and the
importance of early treatment of spinal
epidural abscess.
Methods—A review of the literature on
spinal epidural abscess and a comparison
of the published literature with local
experience.
Results—Imaging with MRI or CT enables
early diagnosis of spinal epidural abcess
and optimal therapy is surgical evacuation combined with 6–12 weeks (median 8
weeks) of antimicrobial chemotherapy.
Clinical features are fever, pain, and focal
neurological signs and may be associated
with preceding and pre-existing bone or
joint disease. The commonest aetiological
organism is S aureus.
Conclusion—Early diagnosis and appropriate early antimicrobial chemotherapy
with surgery is associated with an excellent prognosis.

Spinal epidural abscess is a rare but potentially
devastating condition. When recognised and
treated early the outcome is excellent.1 Late
diagnosis or inadequate treatment may leave
the patient with long term severe or disabling
incapacity. The need for early diagnosis and the
benefits of appropriate early antimicrobial
chemotherapy with surgery are discussed.
Epidemiology
Spinal epidural abscess is an uncommon
condition with an estimated incidence of
0.2–2.0/10 000 hospital admissions,2 3 and a
peak incidence in the sixth and seventh decades
of life.3 4 At this hospital over a five year period
we have seen eight patients admitted from the
community with spinal epidural abcess, giving
an estimated incidence of 0.25/10 000 admissions. Their median age was 61.5 (range
48–75) The disease is rare in children, with
fewer than 90 cases reported.5 Conditions
commonly associated with spinal epidural
abcess include diabetes mellitus, intravenous
drug misuse, chronic renal failure, alcoholism,
and cancer.2–4
Pathophysiology
Most spinal epidural abcesses are thought to
result from the haematogenous spread of
bacteria usually from a cutaneous or mucosal

source and this occurred in five of our eight
patients. In the series by Baker et al,2
haematogenous spread of infection was identified in 26% of cases, the sources of bacteraemia
including furuncles, pharyngitis, and dental
abscesses. Haematogenous spinal epidural abcess are primarily located in the posterior
aspect of the spinal canal.6 The direct spread of
infection into the epidural space from a source
adjacent to the spine—for example, spondylitis
or discitis—is also well described.7 8 In such
cases the abscesses are often located in the
anterior aspect of the spinal canal and are
thought to originate from the adjacent vertebral body. Direct spread from a paraspinal
abscess may also occur and was the infective
origin in one of our patients. In a recent review
of 43 cases of spinal epidural abcess, 44% had
coexistent vertebral osteomyelitis.9 Vertebral
osteomyelitis was present in one of our eight
patients (12.5%).
Postoperative abscesses account for 16% of
all spinal epidural abcesses2 and epidural catheter insertion is another recognised predisposing factor.10 11 None of our patients had
postoperative abscesses.
Blunt trauma is reported to precede the
symptoms of spinal epidural abcess in 15%35% of cases7 and it is postulated that trauma
may result in the formation of an epidural haematoma
which
subsequently
becomes
infected.12 A history of recent trauma was
recorded in two (25%) of our patients although
the source of bacteraemia, as is often the case,
was neither obvious nor identified in either
patient.
Clinical features
The typical features of spinal epidural abcess
are recognisable clinically—notably fever, spinal pain and tenderness, and radiating root
pain followed by limb weakness. Pain is the
most consistent symptom and occurs in virtually all patients at some time during their
illness. Spinal pain and fever are usually the
only symptoms present before a precipitous
neurological deterioration occurs13 and were
the only features in two of our patients Most
patients have major neurological signs before
surgery5 which are thought to result from a
compromised spinal cord vasculature rather
than direct cord compression.14 When septicaemia dominates the clinical picture, as in two of
our patients, whose presenting features
included jaundice, fever, confusion, and raised fibrinogen degradation products, the
neurological symptoms may go unnoticed.
This may also be the case in patients confined
to bed. In patients with chronic infection,

constitutional symptoms of fever, weight loss,

diagnosis and treatment.

Location
The described sites of spinal epidural abcess
are variable. Only 20% occur anterior to the
spinal cord.4 Our experience suggests that

abscesses in the cervical or upper thoracic
region are not uncommon—three of our eight
patients had cervical or thoracic spinal epidural
abcesses. Larger studies, however, describe a
preponderance of lower thoracic and lumbar
abscesses.15 The patients with lumbar abscesses
may be misdiagnosed as having a herniated
lumbar disc.16
Microbiology
Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in six of our
eight patients (75%). This is the most commonly recognised causative organism and
accounts
for
57%-73%
of
reported
abscesses.2 10 14 17 In a review of five studies
between 1930 and 1982,4 Danner and Hartman found that S aureus was isolated in 62%,
other gram positive cocci cultured in 10%,
gram negative organisms in 18%, and anaerobes in 2%. After S aureus, Mycobacterium
tuberculosis is the most frequent cause and
accounted for 25% of infections in the series
reported by Kaufman et al.18 Streptococcus milleri has previously been reported as a cause of
spinal epidural abscess19 and is recognised as an
organism with a tendency to abscess
formation.20 Haemophilus parainfluenzae,21 Brucella species,22 and Actinomyces israelii23 are
amongst the many other isolates described.
Disseminated fungal infections such as cryptococcosis, aspergillosis, and blastomycosis are
rare causes and usually arise in immunocompromised patients.18 Aspergillus species are
known to cause spinal epidural abcess in
patients with AIDS.24
Imaging
The extent and location of an abscess is best
visualised using MRI. Multiplanar imaging and
visualisation of the soft tissues—including the
spinal cord, paraspinal musculature, and the
disc—confers a distinct advantage of MRI over
CT and myelography25 and where available,
should always be utilised (figure A, B, C).
Antimicrobial therapy
Empirical antimicrobial treatment of spinal
epidural abcess should be bactericidal, start
early, be delivered intravenously in high doses,
and be continued well into the postoperative
period.7 Initial treatment should be broad
spectrum and include a combination of drugs
with bactericidal activity against staphylococci,
anaerobes, and gram negative organisms. If a
methicillin sensitive S aureus is isolated,
successful treatment is possible with a first
generation cephalosporin,4 a penicillinase resistant penicillin,26 combination vancomycin
plus aminoglycoside,27 or trimethoprimsulphamethoxazole.28 Parenteral treatment
should be continued for at least 4 weeks and
may be prolonged for 8 weeks or longer if vertebral osteomyelitis is suspected.4 7 When no
pathogen is isolated, broad “best guess” bactericidal cover is safest and best.
Surgery
Surgical treatment entails emergency evacuation of the pus with decompression of the spinal cord and nerve roots. In the presence of

paraparesis, the outcome depends on the time
that elapses from its onset to surgery.18 The
longer the lapse the greater is the usual long
term legacy.
Prognosis
The prognosis is dependent on the clinical and
neurological condition of the patient at presentation and any delay in the diagnosis4 29 or
instigation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment. Patients who present with overt sepsis do
poorly. All such patients in one series died.30
Patients who are plegic preoperatively also do
poorly, although this is time dependent.29 In the
series of Danner and Hartman,4 patients with
preoperative neurological defects present for
less than 36 hours showed some improvement,
whereas nine of 11 patients with deficits
present for more than 36 hours before surgery
did not. In the review by Maslen et al,29 patients
paralysed preoperatively for greater than 12
hours did not recover neurological function
and those paralysed for greater than 36 hours
often died. In our series, the six patients who
had developed neurological signs underwent
surgery within 8 hours of their onset and had a
good outcome. Some authors have found that
the outcome of cervical abscesses is worse than
those arising in thoracic or lumbar sites.14 In
our series, cervical cases had good outcomes
compared with those with thoracolumbar
abscesses. Two cervical cases had MRI as the
primary spinal investigation and at relatively
early stages.
Although the duration of neurological deficit
before surgery determines, in part, the
neurological outcome, it is not the sole factor.
It has been suggested that permanent axonal or
cell body damage, for which we do not have a
clinical indicator, has prognostic relevance. In
our experience one patient who was paraparetic for only three hours before surgery
remained paraparetic afterwards. By contrast,
another patient who was paraplegic for seven
hours made a virtually complete recovery after
surgery.
Mortality
Although the mortality from spinal epidural
abcess has improved from that described in the
early reports, it has remained surprisingly consistent over the past several decades, at about
14%.4 29 Mortality is clearly related to delay in
instituting appropriate therapy, emphasising
the need for early diagnosis and treatment. In
addition, these patients should be followed up
for several months—even after completion of
antibiotic therapy, because of the spinal
instability which may result from the infection
or the necessary surgical intervention.1 There
were no deaths in our series.
Nutrition
Patients undergoing these procedures often
become malnourished and poor nutritional
status is associated with increased postoperative complications. Close attention should
therefore be paid to the perioperative nutrition
and consideration given to preoperative and
postoperative nutritional supplementation.31

Spinal epidural abscess

Mackenzie, Laing, Smith, et al

Conclusion
The appreciable neurological recovery seen in
some patients reflects the value of prompt
diagnosis and early treatment. The key to successful management is early diagnosis, which
requires that involved clinicians consider the
diagnosis. Repeated spinal and neurological
examinations are essential in any patient with
an unknown focus of infection and when there
is spinal pain or tenderness full investigation is
warranted. The increasing availability of MRI
may mean that earlier diagnosis and lower
morbidity from this condition should become a
reality in the near future.
