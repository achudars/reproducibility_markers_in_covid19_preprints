Abstract

30

COVID-19 pandemic has been extensively studied by many researchers.

31

However, it is still unclear why it was restricted to higher latitudes during the initial

32

days and later cascaded in the tropics. Here, we analyzed 176 SARS-CoV-2

33

genomes across different latitudes and climate (Koppen’s climate) that provided

34

insights about within species virus evolution and its relation to abiotic factors. Two

35

genetically variant groups, named as G1 and G2 were identified, well defined by

36

four mutations. The G1 group (ancestor), is mainly restricted to warm and moist,

37

temperate climate (Koppen’s C climate) while its descendent G2 group surpasses

38

the climatic restrictions of G1, initially cascading into neighboring cold climate (D)

39

of higher latitudes and later into hot climate of the tropics (A). It appears that the

40

gradation of temperate climate (Cfa-Cfb) to cold climate (Dfa-Dfb) drives the

41

evolution of G1 into G2 variant group which later adapted to tropical climate (A) as

42

well. It seems this virus followed inverse latitudinal gradient in the beginning due

43

to its preference towards temperate (C) and cold climate (D). Our work elucidates

44

virus evolutionary studies combined with climatic studies can provide crucial

45

information about the pathogenesis and natural spreading pathways in such

Introduction

51

The first case of Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by

52

(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-2) SARS-CoV-2 pathogen was first reported

53

from Wuhan, China1. In spite of various precautions such as lockdown, social

54

distancing, wearing mask, and sanitization, the disease was able to reach almost

55

every part of the world2. This zoonotic virus is like SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory

56

Syndrome) coronavirus (79% similarity) and MERS (50% similarity) and is closely

57

related to bat derived coronaviruses1. The SARS-CoV-2 can survive up to 3, 4, and

58

24 hours on aerosols, copper, and cardboard respectively, and up to 2-3 days on

59

stainless-steel or plastic1 and spreads faster than its ancestors SARS-CoV-1 and

60

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)1,3. This led it concur a larger

61

geographical region by infecting larger population. Since the social behaviour and

62

travelling of humans have not changed much, what makes few respiratory viruses

63

confined locally and others spread globally is still unclear. COVID-19 outbreak led

64

to a big discussion, that does climate have a role in the spread of the disease? The

65

ancestor SARS-CoV-1 losses its viability at higher temperature (38oC) and

66

relatively higher humidity (>95%)4. Experiments support that SARS-CoV-2 is highly

67

stable at 4oC but is sensitive to heat5. Studies both in favour and against have been

68

published but the topic is still debatable6,7. A recent review compiles 61 studies

69

relating COVID-19 with climate1. Several climatic factors such as humidity,

70

precipitation, radiation, temperature, and wind speed affecting this virus spread

71

have been incorporated. Both positive and negative association of COVID-19 with

72

temperature and humidity have been published1. Recently, Carlson et al.

73

mentioned that COVID-19 transmission could be affected by climate but

74

discouraged the use of SDMs (Species Distribution Models) for COVID-19

75

transmission due to their limitations, which generally takes only climatic parameters

76

as input, as they may not be appropriate tools7. This study was challenged by

77

Araujo et al. mentioning strengths and limitations of the tools and reasoned that R0

78

of COVID-19 depends on several factors, it may also be affected by climate6. Since

79

only climatic parameters are insufficient to capture climatic signatures of COVID-

80

19 spread, such patterns can be recognized by combining phylogenetic and

81

climatic studies8. Such approach enables to probe the similarities or differences in

82

virus genome across similar or different climate types present all over the world.

83

To understand such a behaviour, we have attempted to study the genomic

84

sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 across different latitudes and climates.

85

Till now, pathogens are poorly mapped and little is known about their underlying

86

ecological and evolutionary causes9. Nucleotide substitution has been proposed to

87

be one of the most important mechanisms of viral evolution in nature 10. However,

88

factors responsible for the generation of these mutations are not well understood.

89

One of the possible factors is adaptation to new environments, dictated by natural

90

selection that discriminates among genetic variations and favours survival of the

91

fittest11. Virus evolution as a consequence of climate change is poorly understood.

92

SARS-CoV-2 consists of large single-stranded ~30kb long positive-sense RNA.

93

These viruses majorly have a conserved genomic organization, consisting of a

94

unique 265bp long leader sequence, ORF1ab polyprotein, and structural proteins

95

like S (spike glycoprotein), E (Envelope), M (Membrane), and N (Nucleocapsid).

96

ORF1ab encodes replicase, transcriptase and helicase, essential enzymes

97

required for replication, along with non-structural and accessory proteins.

98

Expression of non-structural proteins is facilitated by ribosomal frameshifting12. All

99

coronaviruses express structural proteins S, E, M, N; spike glycoprotein being the

100

most immunogenic to T-cell response13. Spike glycoprotein of coronaviruses binds

101

to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor for viral fusion and

102

entry and is the main target for neutralizing antibodies and development of

103

vaccines14. Membrane protein is also antigenic as it stimulates a humoral immune

104

response15. E protein is responsible for virus assembly and release of virion

105

particles16. Nucleocapsid protein packages RNA genome into a helical

106

ribonucleocapsid protein (RNP) complex during virion assembly and is capable of

107

eliciting an immune response17. Since it is still not clear whether SARS-CoV-2

108

evolution and spread have relation with climate, our study may act as a missing

109

link between genomic sequence, climate and COVID-19 severity. If SARS-CoV-2

110

is responding towards external climate it can be delineated by superimposing its

111

genomic variants across different latitudes and Koppen’s climate8. The earliest and

112

the most simple classification of Earth’s climate is based on latitudes which divide

113

the Earth’s climate into seven climate zones, North Frigid Zone (NFZ), North

114

Temperate Zone (NTZ), North Subtropical Zone (NSTZ), Tropical Zone (TZ), South

115

Subtropical Zone (SSTZ), South Temperate Zone (STZ) and South Frigid Zone

116

(SFZ) lying between 90°N to 66.5°N, 66.5°N to 30°N, 30°N to 23.5°N, 23.5°N to

117

23.5°S, 23.5°S to 30°S, 30°S to 66.5°S and 66.5°S to 90°S, respectively 18. Based

118

on temperature and precipitation, Wladimir Koppen divided Earth’s climate into five

119

major climates, A (Tropical), B (Arid), C (Temperate), D (Cold or Continental) and

120

E (Polar) which are further subdivided into 30 climate types 19. To understand the

121

effect of climate on SARS-CoV-2 evolution, the present study comprises of two

122

parts: (1) Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains, (2) Mapping SARS-CoV-2

123

strains across different climates. These combined studies can provide insights on

124

within species evolution and preferential distribution of SARS-CoV-2 across

125

different climatic zones which might be difficult to probe through individual studies.

126

Methodology

127

Molecular phylogenetic analysis

128

Approximately, 11,000 full-length genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were

129

available in Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database,

130

accessed till 2nd May 2020. 185 full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences from

131

countries across the globe, with genome length more than 29 kb and high coverage

132

were obtained from GISAID database and the reference genome was retrieved

133

from GenBank24 (Supplementary Table S1). This sample size was selected by

134

taking 95% confidence interval, 0.5 standard deviation and 7% margin of error. To

135

avoid bias related to the geographical area covered by a country, genomic

136

sequence of strains isolated from different locations from each country/ climate

137

type was retrieved, depending on the availability of data. The corresponding

138

location, latitude, Koppen’s climate, Koppen’s Climate type, SARS-CoV-2 variant

139

group, Environment/ Region, Climate zone, temperature, and precipitation of each

140

strain is provided in Supplementary Table S2. These sequences were aligned to

141

the full reference genome20 by using Biomanager and Seqinr packages of R

142

(version 3.6.3). Among 185 genomes, some partial genomes were discarded.

143

Thus, finally 176 genomes were analysed. NC_045512 genome sequence was

144

used as reference and the genomic coordinate in this study is based on this

145

reference genome. Based on protein annotations, nucleotide level variants were

146

converted into amino acid codon variants for alignments when its location within a

147

gene was identified. The amino acid position numbering is according to its position

148

within the specified gene (Coding Sequence) as annotated in reference sequence

149

(NC_045512, NCBI)20. To ensure comparability, we trimmed the flanks of all

150

sequences. The aligned sequences were used to construct a phylogenetic tree

151

using MEGA X21. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining

152

method (500 bootstrap tests)22. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length =

153

0.01116462 is shown. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same

154

units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The

155

evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood

156

method23 and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. All

157

ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion

158

option). A total of 29408 positions were present in the final dataset. The results are

159

presented in the form of DNA sequencing i.e., U (uracil) is read as T (thymine). We

160

have labeled each virus strain by the GISAID Accession ID and the location from

161

which it was isolated in the format “Location|EPI ISL Accession ID”, in the

162

constructed phylogenetic tree. For ease of visualization, we have marked a new

163

Strain ID (1 to 176) against each SARS-CoV-2 isolate in the phylogenetic tree

164

(Figure 1). The same Strain ID is used for the climatic studies in this article. High-

165

frequency SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) distinguishing one virus

166

cluster from the others is referred to as “virus cluster SNPs” throughout this paper.

167

Mapping virus strain on the Koppen’s climate map

168

The location of each SARS-CoV-2 strain is obtained from the METADATA file

169

provided in GISAID database for each viral isolate (Supplementary Table S1). The

170

coordinates of the locations were taken from the official website of USGS Earth

171

Explorer24. The Gieger-Koppen’s climate map is used for climatic studies19. The

172

Koppen’s climate type, temperature, precipitation of each strain is assessed from

173

weatherbase25 and CLIMATE.ORG26. The above information for each strain is

174

tabulated in Supplementary Table S2. The map is georeferenced by using ‘Arc-

175

GIS 10.1’27. The locations of all strains (n=176) were transferred to the

176

georeferenced map27. On the map, the G1 strains were symbolized as ‘Yellow-

177

circle’, and G2 as ‘Square’ (Figure 3). Each strain in the map is labelled as per their

178

Strain ID (1 to 176) (Figure 3), the map combines information of the phylogeny,

179

climate, and global distribution of SARS-CoV-2. These locations were classified

180

into coastal and continental region, we define the coastal region as land region <

181

500 km from the ocean/sea and the continental region as land lying >500 km from

182

the coastline measured through google maps.

183

Statistical analysis

184

Chi-square were performed in Microsoft Excel (2016) to test our null hypothesis.

185

Null hypothesis for these tests are mentioned in the text and its corresponding

186

contingency table is mentioned in Supplementary Table S2. Histograms depicting

187

the distribution of coronavirus in coastal region, continental region, Koppen’s

188

climate and climate type were plotted using R (version 3.6.3). SigmaPlot10 was

189

used to generate box plot, regression plot, and mesh plot to statistically compare

190

frequency distribution of latitude, temperature, and precipitation of G1 and G2

191

strains. We performed one-way ANOVA to estimate statistical differences in the

192

latitude, temperature and precipitation between G1 and G2 virus populations.

193

Various scatterplots between latitude, temperature, and precipitation of G1 and G2

194

strains were plotted in R (version 3.6.3). Values were considered statistically

208

Molecular phylogeny analysis to infer genomic similarities and their

209

210

To probe genomic similarities between SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates, a phylogenetic

211

tree was constructed by aligning 176 virus genomes to the reference genome 20

212

retrieved from GISAID. Interestingly, our Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)

213

results reveal sixty virus cluster Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) (see

214

methodology). Table1 comprises of SNPs of virus clusters across different climatic

215

zones, Koppen’s climate and climate type. Climatic parameters (temperature and

216

precipitation) for each virus strain is mentioned in Supplementary Table S2. Based

217

on phylogenetic clustering, 176 SARS-CoV-2 strains are majorly divided into two

218

groups, we named them as G1 (1-58) and G2 (59-176) (Figure 1). Predominantly

219

four mutations distinguish G2 from G1 group, i.e., 1) a synonymous mutation

220

(C241T) appeared in the unique leader sequence, 2) F924 (C3037T) appeared in

221

nsp3, encoding for papain-like proteinase28, 3) a non-synonymous mutation,

222

P214L (C14408T) arose in ORF1b, that codes for four putative non-structural

223

proteins (nsp13, nsp14, nsp15 and nsp16), functionally involved in replication-

224

transcription complex29, and 4) D614G (A23403G) arose in S gene, encoding spike

225

glycoprotein13 (Figure 2a). Among four mutations in G2, the D614G mutation, lying

226

in spike glycoprotein was widely studied due to its higher infectivity and

227

involvement in entering the host cell through hACE2 receptors30–33. The other three

228

mutations in G2 have co-evolved with D614G making it distinguishable from G1.

229

We explored the extent of genome-wide divergence of G1 and G2 group across

230

different climate zones and Koppen’s climate (Figure 2b). 59% of G1 viruses fall in

231

NTZ, 14% in NSTZ, 12% in TZ, 10% in SSTZ and 5% in STZ. 76% of the virus

232

isolates in G2 group are present in the NTZ, 13.5% in TZ, 7.6% in STZ and

233

remaining 2% is equally distributed in NSTZ and SSTZ, showing G2 strain variants

234

evolved to adapt to temperate zones as their population decreased drastically in

235

the subtropical zones. These results show both G1 and G2 strains have a strong

236

preference towards higher latitudes i.e., NTZ (Figure 2c). Mapping viral strains on

237

Koppen’s map (thoroughly discussed in the next section) reveal their prevalence

238

majorly in the C and D climate (Figure 2d). 71% of G1 lie in C climate, 17% in D

239

and the remaining is equally distributed in the A and B climate. 54% of G2 lie in C

240

climate, 36% in D, 9% in A and 1% in B climate pointing towards a preferential shift

241

of the novel coronavirus towards D climate (Figure 2b), alluding G2 is climatically

242

and genomically more diverse than G1. The analysis suggests that the G1 group

243

is mostly restricted to temperate climate (C) and G2 is climatically and

10

244

geographically widely distributed, it is possible that these mutations were acquired

245

by G1 to stabilize itself in different climates hence allowing it to spread globally.

246

Similar climatic concordance with the temperate climate (C) was also observed for

247

SARS-CoV-1 that was responsible for 2002-2004 epidemic as it prevailed in

248

regions of Australia, Europe, Canada and, China34, having Koppen’s C climate.

249

Such similar occurrence of SARS-CoV-1 and G1 group of SARS-CoV-2 hints

250

towards, why initially G1 variant group (consisting of the reference genome

251

NC_04551220) that has 79% similarity to SARS-CoV-11 was majorly located in the

252

temperate climate (C), and latter it evolved into G2 variant group that allowed it to

253

extend its climatic boundaries into temperate, cold and tropical climate. These

254

results suggest these four SNPs could be the key factors in increasing the

255

virulence, transmission and sustainability of the virus in humans.

256

We further analyzed the order in which the phylogenetic clusters evolved from the

257

ancestor 45-57 cluster (containing the reference genome, Strain ID: 50) based on

258

nodes, mutational branches and branch length. The order in which the virus

259

evolved is 44-47 (G1440A, G392D; G2891A, A876T), 1-22 (C8782T, S2839;

260

T28144C, L84S), 33-43 (G26144T, G251V), 23-32, 58-61 (C15324T, N519), 80-

261

115 (G28881A, G28882A, R203K; G28883C, G204R), 116-125 (A20268G,

262

L2167), 126-176 (G25563T, Q57H) and 62-79 (cluster, acquired genomic mutation

263

and its corresponding amino acid mutation). In Figure 2e, looking at the distribution

264

of the viruses in different climate zones, no such preference was observed as the

265

virus evolved. Virus cluster 58-61, linking G1 and G2 has an equal distribution of

266

virus strains in C and D climate. The virus cluster 80-115 of G2 more closely related

267

to G1, is widely distributed in A, C and D climates. Within 80-115 virus cluster, 106-

268

115 cluster shows distribution in C and A climate. A trend was observed that virus

269

clusters in G2 group gradually evolved to sustain in Koppen’s D climate (80-115 to

270

116-125 to 126-176). Within these major virus clusters, small clusters also exist as

271

shown in Table1 with their mutations along with their climatic distribution.

272

We have examined whether climatic conditions exhibit any selective pressure on

273

each gene (Figure 2f). Since, the present picture of the data shows that SARS-

274

CoV-2 spreads widely in NTZ, as expected all genes are having mutations in NTZ,

275

suggesting the virus is probably using varied mechanisms to adapt to the two main

276

climates of NTZ i.e., temperate (C) and cold or continental (D). Mutations in the M

277

gene are only pertaining to NTZ and NSTZ and are present in C and D climate. In

278

particular, there is a surge in the virus strains carrying SNPs in ORF8 in the NSTZ

279

(20%). 77% of the SNPs in ORF8 lie in the C and 20% in the D climate. Overall,

280

the distribution of virus cluster SNPs of ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, and N gene follows a

281

similar pattern across all the climatic zones and Koppen’s climate, implying no

282

difference in selective pressure of the climate in generating mutations in these

Apart from non-synonymous mutations, synonymous mutations within the gene

can also significantly affect protein function due to codon usage bias 35 and through

mechanisms such as ribosome stalling36 and mRNA secondary structure

Distribution of strains across Koppen’s climate

298

To probe the relation between climate and SARS-CoV-2 strains, we superimposed

299

genomic information along with their geolocations on the climate map of Wladimir

300

Koppen (Figure 3). We carefully examined the distribution of strains on Koppen’s

301

map and an overview of the map shows, the distribution of 176 strains are mainly

302

concentrated in the western coasts of Europe and North America, and eastern

303

coasts of China, North America, Australia and South America (Figure 3).

304

Throughout the text Koppen’s climate type is marked within quotations and its

305

standard symbol is written within brackets e.g., “humid-subtropical” (Cfa). List of

306

Koppen’s symbol of each climate type is given in Supplementary Table S3 and its

307

criteria for classification is given in Supplementary Table S4. Mostly the SARS-

308

CoV-2 strains are distributed in the “humid-subtropical” (Cfa) and “marine-

309

temperate” (Cfb) and “humid-continental” (Dfa-Dfb) climate and, two strains from

310

virus clusters (80-115 and 126-176) belonging to South America, are found in

311

“tropical-savanna” (Aw) of ‘A’ climate (Supplementary Table S5). The map displays

312

~86% (151/176) of virus isolates are distributed in the coastal regions and the

313

remaining in continental region (Chi-square test, P<.001 considering null

314

hypothesis that equal number of virus isolates are found in coastal and continental

315

region, Figure 4a, Supplementary Table S6). Around ~74% (130/176) of the total

316

strains are distributed in “humid-subtropical” (Cfa) and “marine-temperate” (Cfb)

317

climate type of C climate and “humid-continental” (Dfa-Dfb) climate type of D

precipitation) in which these strains lie, were analyzed. Statistically, significant

323

difference was found in the latitudes of G1 ~24.14±3.5 (mean±s.e.) and G2

324

~34.03±2.7 (one-way ANOVA, P=.03251, Figure 5a). Statistically, significant

325

difference was observed in the temperatures of G1 (15.82±0.75 oC (mean±s.e.)

326

and G2 (11.67±0.68 oC) strains (one-way ANOVA, P<.001, Figure 5b). However,

327

the difference in precipitation for G1 (1046.95±80 mm) and G2 (896.64±35.48 mm)

328

strains is statistically not significant (one-way ANOVA, P=.06118, Figure 5c). The

329

latitudes and temperature are inversely related to each other (r = -0.6649,

330

Supplementary Figure S1a), which explains the occurrence of G1 strains in lower

331

and G2 strains in higher latitudes (Figure 5d). Such relation between latitude and

332

precipitation has not been observed (r = -0.3064, Supplementary Figure S1b and

333

Figure 5e). A mesh plot simultaneously evaluates all climatic parameters for both

334

G1 and G2 strains, the results agree to the limited temperature and wider

335

precipitation range of G1 group and interestingly the G2 group appears in a wider

336

temperature and shows a preferential shift towards lower temperature which is

337

evident from the fact that it initially appeared more in higher latitudes

338

(Supplementary Figure S2). A complete description of the distribution of G1 and

339

G2 strains lying in different countries and/or continents of the world is provided in

340

Supplementary Figure S3 and Supplementary Material.

Discussion

342

A pattern observed and discussed by several authors is that SARS-CoV-2

343

predominantly affected higher latitude countries (eg., China, Europe, USA and

The climatic parameters (temperature and

344

Australia, Japan, Turkey etc.) in its preliminary stage (November 2019 to March

345

2020). This led many researchers predict a reduced spread in regions with higher

346

temperature such as tropical countries38,39. Our phylogenetic analysis provides one

347

more dimension to the above observations in which we have identified two groups

348

G1 and G2, similar observations were also reflected in other studies40,41. We have

349

further integrated the genomic information with climatic data and analyzed the

350

spread of these two variant groups across the globe and its climate.

351

There can be many reasons behind the observed pattern of spread. First, it could

352

be because of less testing in tropical countries. However, if this would be true, local

353

media would have reported over-crowding of patients in hospitals. For example,

354

Italy escalated its testing when media reported over-crowding of hospitals with

355

patients having COVID symptoms. But such incidences were not reported from

356

tropical countries. Second, it could be higher human mobility between China US,

357

and China Europe. But mobility between China and South-East Asia is also very

358

high. Thus, no outbreak in tropical countries initially is perplexing (till March 2020).

359

Third, most countries implemented lock-down measures from mid-March. Until

360

March people were working in normal mode. Hence, it is not possible that stringent

361

measures in containing the virus evaded it from cascading into the tropical

362

countries. Fourth, the population density of the tropics could be lower than

363

temperate countries. But this is also not true, in fact most of world population

364

resides in tropical countries and are mostly developing with limited proper health

365

and hygiene facilities compared to temperate countries. In such situation the

366

disease should have equally spread in tropics like that of temperate countries as

367

positive cases of COVID-19 were identified from many tropical countries in January

368

itself. Fifth, our analyses show that G1 group spread largely in temperate climate.

369

A possible reason behind this could be that host-immune response of people

370

residing in the tropical countries resisted the infection. However, no supporting

371

evidence have been found till now and needs detailed investigation.

372

Hence, these reasons negate the fact that the observed patterns could solely be

373

due to community structure, social dynamics, government policies, global

374

connectivity, population density and number of reported cases. Similar

375

observations i.e. more COVID cases in higher latitudes were reflected in COVID-

376

19 growth curves of Yusuf and Bukhari until March 2020 for different countries,

377

which led them interpret that natural factors (temperature and humidity) are

378

responsible for less number of COVID cases in tropical countries42. Thus, we are

379

inclined to say that environmental factors, directly or indirectly play a role to explain

380

the observed pattern of spread in cold countries during the initial stages. Since, in

381

winters mostly people stay indoors, thus climate can indirectly be involved in

382

increased growth rate of virus in cold countries. However, if climate indirectly had

383

a role to play in the spread, spread of the disease would have been limited in

384

summers in tropical countries. On the contrary, the COVID-19 outbreak in tropical

385

countries started in summers, soon after emergence of G2 strains.

386

Results of this study depict that in the initial stages (until March 2020) of the

387

pandemic the G1 group was restricted to temperate climate (Koppen’s C type)

388

whereas G2 group spread all over the world. Our analyses suggest that same

389

regions were affected by G1 variant group and SARS-CoV-1. It is known that

390

SARS-CoV-1 was not able to survive in regions with warm climate as its lipid bilayer

391

was prone to degradation at higher temperature43 and it loses its viability at higher

392

temperature4. A recent study shows the structural stability of SARS-CoV-2 Virus

16

393

Like Particles (VLPs) degrades on increasing temperature44, supporting our

394

observations.

395

Our analyses favor that evolution of G1 into G2 helps to sustain this virus from

396

temperate to cold and tropical climate successively, mainly due to four mutations

397

i.e., in leader sequence, ORF1ab, and S gene. The leader sequence and ORF1ab

398

is involved in replication and transcription, and the S gene is involved in binding to

399

the host cell through hACE2 receptors. Substitutions in the ORF1ab gene may

400

increase the synthesis of replicase-transcriptase complex, thus, increasing the

401

replication rate of the virus and blocking the host innate-immune response. 614

402

position in spike glycoprotein lies near the S1/S2 subunit junction where the furin-

403

cleavage site is present (R667) that enhances virion cell-cell fusion45. This

404

suggests, aspartate to glycine substitution in the vicinity of the furin-recognition site

405

may result in a conformational change of the spike glycoprotein that favors higher

406

affinity of the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) to hACE2. A recent article showed

407

retroviruses pseudotyped with Glycine at 614 position infected ACE2-expressing

408

cells markedly more efficiently than those with Aspartic acid due to less S1

409

shedding and greater incorporation of the S protein into the pseudovirion 30. Several

410

studies reported D614G mutation is increasing at an alarming rate 31,32. Few

411

observed that this alteration correlated with increased viral loads in COVID-19

412

patients31. This is consistent with the epidemiological data showing proportion of

413

viruses bearing G614 is correlated to increased case fatality rate on a country by

414

country basis33. This substitution coevolved with substitution in the leader

415

sequence, nsp3 and RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) proteins,

416

suggesting these mutations allow the virus to transmit more efficiently. This

417

explains these mutations have not emerged merely because of founder’s effect but

418

this virus under selection pressure has made itself more stable and infective. Also,

419

Forster et al. observed in his phylogenetic analysis, the preferential geographical

420

spread of SARS-CoV-2 and provided a plausible cause which could be founders

421

effect or immunological or environmental effect41. Although there is a possibility

422

that the stable variant might have appeared because of host innate immune

423

response or some unknown reason, in such a case it would not show any close

424

association with climate. Through our analysis, we are inclined to say that climate

425

has an effect of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. However, in particular, selective pressure

426

of climate on each gene of SARS-CoV-2 is not visible. Our genomic analysis of

427

virus strains show that the novel coronavirus undergoes both synonymous as well

428

as non-synonymous mutations throughout its genome in various climates,

429

suggesting the novel coronavirus uses multiple mechanisms both at the

430

transcriptional and translational level for evading the immune response, developing

431

drug resistance and increasing pathogenesis. However, the actual role of these

432

mutations is not yet determined, and these studies need to be further enlightened

433

by biophysical and biochemical studies. Such mutational insights will aid the design

434

of efficacious vaccines that can be stored and transported in a wide range of

435

temperature and conditions, thereby minimizing cold storage costs.

436

To delineate the signatures of underlying abiotic factors (temperature,

437

precipitation, and latitude) responsible for evolution of SARS-CoV-2 (n=176),

438

spreading patterns of G1 and G2 strains were carefully examined on Koppen’s

439

climate map. Figure 3 shows an elevated spread of COVID-19 in the western and

440

eastern coasts of the continents and a diminished spread in the hot and cold

441

deserts. The G1 strains are majorly present in the eastern and western coasts of

442

the continents and G2 strains lie in both the coastal regions and continent’s interior.

443

On a closer inspection, the eastern coasts of continents consist of “humid-

444

subtropical” (Cfa) climate while the western coasts of continents consist of “marine-

445

temperate” (Cfb), commonly known as east and west coast climate, respectively.

446

These two climates are very similar to each other and belongs to temperate climate

447

also known as C type climate of Koppen’s classification scheme. A very large

448

portion (~94%) of habitable China consists of temperate climate (C), i.e., humid

449

subtropical climate (Cfa), which explains presence of only G1 strains in China and

450

one strain of G1 is present in cold climate (D) present near the transition of

451

temperate (C) to cold climate (D), thus probably temperate climate was suitable for

452

G1. A similar association of G1 with temperate climate (C) was found in eastern

453

and western coast of North America, eastern coast of South America, western

454

coast of Europe and eastern and western coast of Australia. Statistically,

455

distribution of G1 strains all over the globe is in concordance with the temperate

456

climate and strongly favor C climate (Chi-square test, P<.01 for null hypothesis that

457

G1 strains are equally distributed in all climates, Supplementary Table S6) as

458

compared to any other climate. If climate does not have any role in the evolution

459

and preferential spread of coronavirus, in such a case G1 would have been evenly

460

distributed in all climate types which is not the case. Few exceptions of G1 seen

461

in other climate types are most probably because of travel as they remained

462

subsided in that climate, implying their inability to sustain in other climate types. It

463

appears that the G1 strains existed in temperate climate all over the world but could

464

not extend their geographical territories beyond temperate climate. Contrastingly,

465

the evolved G2 strains can sustain in temperate (C), cold (D) and tropical (A)

466

climate surpassing the climatic restrictions of G1. Map interpretation suggests that

467

G2 strains enters the continent’s interior through D climate (e.g., North America

468

and Russia). Temperate climate (C) generally grades into cold climate (D) and

469

deserts (B) in the northern hemisphere (e.g., C to D: Europe to Russia, and USA

470

to Canada; C to B: China, and USA). In southern hemisphere, gradation of

471

temperate climate (C) into tropical climate (A) and deserts (B) exists (e.g., C to A,

472

Brazil; C to B, Australia), C to A transition is identified by virus cluster 105-115 in

473

phylogenetic tree. In Russia, 91.3% (21/23) of the strains belong to G2 (Figure 3),

474

are mainly present in the ~8500 km long and 600-1700 km wide D climate belt

475

(‘Dfa-Dfb-Dw’), suggesting the G2 strains might have adapted to the D climate

476

(Chi-square test, P<.001 for null hypothesis that both G1 and G2 strains are equally

477

found in D climate of Russia, Supplementary Table S6). Similar observations are

478

seen for North America, South America, and Australia. The eastern and western

479

coasts of North America have temperate climate and are connected by cold climate

480

along USA-Canada boundary (i.e., having humid subtropical (Cfa) in eastern coast

481

and marine temperate climate (Cfb) in western coast) (Figure 3). The G2 strains

482

follows this cold climate (Dfa-Dfb) belt which is ~3800 km long and ~600 to 1000

483

km wide. The dominance of G2 and nearly absence of G1 population in cold climate

484

of North America is similar to the observations of Russia. Our analyses suggests

485

that a fall of temperature from temperate to cold climate might have dictated the

486

evolution of G1 into G2 variant group. Similarly, a change in climate from C to A

487

probably made the strains stable in tropical regions. Overall, our analyses suggest

488

that SARS-CoV-2 has likely evolved to sustain in different climate, thereby

489

increasing its spread. Studies combining genetic information with climate can

490

provides useful information about virus evolution and possible climatic pathways

491

during an outbreak.

Conclusion

494

It is reasonable to assume COVID-19 transmission pathway and evolution is

495

influenced by climate. Phylogenetic network classified 176 SARS-CoV-2 strains

496

into two variant groups G1 and G2. The G1 strains were habituated to C climate

497

that evolved into G2 by undergoing significant mutations (C241T in leader

498

sequence, F924 in ORF1a, P214L in ORF1b and D614G in S gene), plausibly

499

extended its climatic boundaries from C to D climate, displaying role of natural

500

selection on virus evolution. In our analysis SARS-CoV-2, were found resistive to

501

desert climate (B). Gradually, strains are adapting to A climate in South America.

502

The strains adapted to “tropical-savannah” (Aw) climate are a threat to all the

503

tropical countries, which were initially less affected by COVID-19. Nevertheless,

504

due to the uncertainty of COVID-19 data, the results should be carefully interpreted

505

and should not be extrapolated to climate types and climatic conditions other than

506

those analyzed here for the early evolution period. The study agrees that viruses

507

are sensitive to their environment and respond towards naturally occurring abiotic

508

factors such as temperature, latitude and humidity to sustain in different climate of

509

the Earth, which also provides insights about seasonal variations possibly being a

510

strong reason for the spread of other viral diseases as well. Here we showed a

511

more refined description of genes based on phylogenetics and their distribution

512

across different climates. This finer-grained analyses led to highly relevant insights

513

on evolutionary dynamics of poorly understood SARS-CoV-2 genome and

514

provides vital information about the direction of the spread and highlights

515

vulnerable regions of Earth. Such inter-disciplinary studies will play an imperative

516

role in designing antiviral strategies and taking pre-emptive precautionary

517

measures to combat such a pandemic.

Potential caveats

635

We acknowledge that there are few caveats due to uncertainty in the COVID-19

636

data. The data from the tropical regions is limited because at the time of data

637

collection (SARS-CoV-2 strains) from all over the world, the strains from the

638

tropical countries were very limited, from few tropical regions strains were available

639

(e.g., Ghana (Africa); India, Mexico, Nepal, Pakistan) but the data has been

640

discarded due to the travel history of the strains, a large fraction of strains without

641

travel history have large gaps in genomic sequences which were not suitable for

642

the present study. Also, case history of each patient is not reported in the

643

METADATA file as collecting all information from each patient is time-consuming.

644

Hence, there are chances patients from whom these strains were isolated may

645

have a migratory history. Data from different individual locations without travel

646

history and large gaps in genomic sequences have been incorporated in this study.

647

Due to these reasons, our analyses should be carefully interpreted and should not

648

be extrapolated to climate types and climatic conditions other than those analyzed

649

here for the early evolution period.

NOTE: Virus clusters are named by Strain ID as depicted on the tree (Supplementary Table
S1 and S2). Genomic coordinates in this study is based on reference genome20. The SNP
positions are based on the reference genome. Nucleotide T represents nucleotide U in the
SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. Mutation at the protein level is not mentioned for the SNPs arising
in the non-coding region. The amino acid position numbering is according to its position within
the specified gene (CDS). In Climate zone column we have mentioned the major climate zone
for the corresponding virus cluster18. KCT is Koppen’s Climate Type and KC is Koppen’s
Climate columns display the main Koppen’s climate in which most of the virus isolates of the
corresponding virus cluster lie. ‘Mix’ implies no particular climate type is favored19.

Figure 1: Phylogenetic network divides 176 SARS-CoV-2 strains into two variant
groups. Largely, the left side of the tree (1 to 58) constitute the G1 group and the right side
of the tree constitutes the G2 group (59 to 176). Branch length is proportional to the genomic
relatedness of the viral isolates. Closely related virus isolates comprise the same SNP with
respect to the reference genome (Strain ID: 50) and form a cluster. The evolutionary history
of 176 taxa was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method22 (500 bootstrap tests). A total of
29408 positions were analysed with nucleotide position numbering according to the reference
sequence20.

Figure 2: Molecular phylogeny analysis to infer genomic similarities of SARS-CoV-2
and their distribution across different climate zones18 and Koppen’s climate types19. (a)
Genomic architecture of SARS-CoV-2 genome highlighting four positions, substitutions on
these positions probably enabled evolution of G1 into G2 variant group. (b, e-g) Strains found
within a virus cluster (as shown in the phylogenetic tree and mentioned in Table 1) were
analysed for significant mutations that may have arisen due to climatic pressure. Hence,
percentage of such virus strains is plotted according to the geographical location of the climate
zone from where they were isolated. The height of the bar is proportional to percent virus strain
occurring in the specified condition i.e., labelled on the x-axis. Box in the left panel consist of
color code for each climate zone and box in the right panel consist of color code for Koppen’s
climate. Left panel shows distribution of percent virus strains in different climate zones and
right panel shows distribution of percent virus strain in Koppen’s climate (b) Percent virus
strains prevailing in different climate zones, stratified by SARS-CoV-2 variant groups. Width
of curves of violin plot is proportional to the number of SARS-CoV-2 strains (n=176) in varied
(c) climate zones and (d) Koppen’s climate. (e) Abiotic factors influencing evolutionary
dynamics of phylogenetic virus clusters. (f) Percent of virus strains with high frequency SNPs

Figure 3: Global distribution of SARS-CoV-2 strains on the Gieger-Koppen’s map
displaying different climate types19. Each strain is labelled as per the strain ID (1 to 176)
within parenthesis. The G1 strains were symbolized as ‘Yellow-circle’, and G2 as ‘Square’,
pink square denotes strain clusters (80-115) stable across C, D and A climate, purple square
represents strain cluster (126-176) stable majorly in D climate, the remaining G2 strains (blue
squares) are stable across C and D climate. Standard Koppen’s climate-type symbols are
mentioned in the legend, the criteria for distinguishing these climate types, is mentioned in
Table S3. Table S4 contains full form of these symbols. All symbols with initials ‘A’ (Af, Am,
Aw) are of tropical climate, initials with ‘B’ belong to desert climate, ‘C’ to temperate and ‘D’ to
cold and ‘E’ to polar climate. The shades of blue on the map, in North America and Russia
belongs to D climate. The shades of blue in South America, Africa, and South Asia belong to
tropical climate. Shades of yellow and green belongs to C climate. Shades of red, orange and
pink belong to Desert climate.

Figure 5: Comparative analysis of different climatic parameters such as latitude,
temperature and precipitation between G1 and G2 variant groups. (a) Positive values
represent the latitude range falling in Northern Hemisphere and negative values represent
latitude range falling in Southern Hemisphere. The G2 strains preferentially occur towards the
higher latitudes than G1 (P=.032; 95% CI 17.12-31.12 for G1; 95% CI 28.67-68.06 for G2).
(b) The mean annual temperature of G2 is significantly lower than the G1 strains (P<.001;
95% CI 17.32-14.32 for G1; 95% CI 13.02-10.33 for G2) (c) Mean annual precipitation of G1
and G2 strains is nearly same (P=.061; 95% CI 1207.16-886.75 for G1; 95% CI 966.91-826.37
for G2). (a-c) Black horizontal line in the middle of the box is median, upper and lower limits
of the box indicate first and third quartile. Black dots represent outliers. P values is based on
one-way ANOVA. Scatter plot for (d) latitude and annual temperature and (e) latitude and
precipitation for each SARS-CoV-2 strain (n=176) belonging to G1 group (n=58, shown in light
grey) and G2 group (n=118, shown in dark grey).
