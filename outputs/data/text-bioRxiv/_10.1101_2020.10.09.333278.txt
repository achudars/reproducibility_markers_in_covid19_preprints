Abstract

46

Characterization of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of Covid-19,

47

is essential to help control the infection. In this regard, we and others recently reported that the

48

neutralization activity of plasma from COVID-19 patients decreases rapidly during the first

49

weeks after recovery. However, the specific role of each immunoglobulin isotype in the overall

50

neutralizing capacity is still not well understood. In this study, we selected plasma from a cohort

51

of Covid-19 convalescent patients and selectively depleted immunoglobulin A, M or G before

52

testing the remaining neutralizing capacity of the depleted plasma. We found that depletion of

53

immunoglobulin M was associated with the most substantial loss of virus neutralization,

54

followed by immunoglobulin G. This observation may help design efficient antibody-based

55

COVID-19 therapies and may also explain the increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 of

56

autoimmune patients receiving therapies that impair the production of IgM.

Introduction

59
60

Since its discovery in Wuhan in 2019, the causative agent of COVID-19, the SARS-CoV-2

61

virus (Zhu et al., 2020), has become a major global public health problem.

62

understanding of immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to help control

63

the infection. Several studies have shown that the neutralization activity of plasma from

64

COVID-19 patients decreases rapidly during the first weeks after recovery (Beaudoin-Bussières

65

et al., 2020; Long et al., 2020; Prévost et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020; Seow et al., 2020).

66

Although a good correlation between the presence of Spike (S)-specific antibodies and the

67

capacity of plasma from infected individuals to neutralize viral particles was reported, recent

68

data looking at individual immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes revealed a stronger correlation between

69

the decrease in S-specific IgM antibodies and loss of neutralization compared to S-specific IgG

70

and IgA antibodies, suggesting that IgM play an important role in the neutralization activity of

71

plasma from individuals who suffered from COVID-19 (Beaudoin-Bussières et al., 2020;

72

Prévost et al., 2020). To better understand the relative contribution of S-specific IgM, IgA and

73

IgG antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we selectively depleted each Ig isotype from

74

plasma obtained from 25 convalescent donors and assessed the impact of depletion on the

75

capacity of the plasma to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral particles and wild type infectious

76

SARS-CoV-2 viral particles.

83

complete resolution of symptoms for at least 14 days before sampling are presented in Table 1.

84

Selective depletion of IgM, IgA or IgG was achieved by adsorption on isotype-specific ligands

85

immobilized on Sepharose or agarose beads, starting with a five-fold dilution of plasma (see

86

details in Stars Methods). The depletion protocols permitted to efficiently deplete each isotype

87

while leaving the other isotypes nearly untouched, as measured by ELISA (Fig 1A-C).

88

Depletion of IgG had a much higher impact on the total level of SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies

89

than IgM and IgA depletion (Fig 1D), although RBD-specific antibodies of each isotype were

90

selectively removed by the depletion (Fig. 1E-G). The impact of IgG depletion on the level of

91

total antibodies against the full S glycoprotein expressed on 293T cells (measured by flow

92

cytometry) was also noticeable (Fig. 1H) whereas isotype-specific detection of full S antibodies

93

by flow cytometry confirmed the efficacy of selective depletion (Fig. 1I-K).

94
95

Neutralizing activity of depleted plasma

96

We then evaluated the capacity of non-depleted and isotype-depleted plasma samples to

97

neutralize pseudoviral particles expressing the S glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 (Prévost et

98

al., 2020) (Star Methods). Depletion of IgM, IgA or IgG all resulted in a significant decrease of

99

neutralization compared to non-depleted plasma (Fig. 2A-D). However, the loss of

100

neutralization activity was much more pronounced in IgM- and IgG-depleted plasma with a 5.5

101

and 4.5 fold decrease in mean ID50 compared to non-depleted plasma respectively, than in IgA-

102

depleted plasma where a 2.4 fold decrease only was observed (Fig. 2E). To evaluate whether

103

the impact of isotype depletion on neutralization could be extended beyond pseudoviral

104

particles, we tested plasma from eight donors in microneutralization experiments using fully

105

infectious SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, as described in the Star Methods. The neutralizing

106

potency of plasma was greatly reduced following IgM and IgG (4.0 and 2.9 fold respectively)

107

but not IgA (no decrease) depletion (Fig. 2F and G). Despite the limited number of samples

108

tested with the live virus, the impact of IgM and IgG depletion on neutralization was similar to

109

that observed with the same samples in the pseudoviral particles neutralization assay (Fig. 3A-

110

C). This data not only confirms the role of IgG in neutralizing activity of convalescent plasma

111

but also highlights the important contribution of IgM with respect to neutralization activity.

112
113

Discussion

114
115

Our findings detailing the important role of IgM in the neutralizing activity of convalescent

116

plasma has several implications. First, although the therapeutic efficacy of convalescent plasma

117

for the treatment of COVID-19 patients remains to be established, it is likely that neutralizing

118

antibodies will play a role. Because SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibodies rapidly decrease

119

after disease onset (Beaudoin-Bussières et al., 2020; Prévost et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020;

120

Seow et al., 2020), the collection of convalescent plasma with maximal neutralizing activity

121

should be performed early after disease recovery. Second, our results suggest that caution

122

should be taken when using therapeutics that impair the production of IgM. Anti-CD20

123

antibodies (B cell-depleting agents) are used to treat several inflammatory disorders. Their use

124

is associated with IgM deficiency in a substantial number of patients, while their impact on IgG

125

and IgA levels is more limited (Kridin and Ahmed, 2020). In line with our data, recent studies

126

reported that anti-CD20 therapy could be associated with a higher susceptibility to contract

127

SARS-CoV-2 and develop severe COVID-19 (Guilpain et al., 2020; Hughes et al., 2020; Safavi

128

et al., 2020; Schulze-Koops et al., 2020; Sharmeen et al., 2020; Sormani et al., 2020). Whether

129

this is associated to the preferential depletion of IgM-producing B cells by these treatments

130

(Looney et al., 2008) remains to be shown. Nevertheless, our results suggest that IgM levels

131

should be investigated as a biomarker to stratify patients on immunosuppressive therapies at

132

higher risk for COVID-19.

133

In summary, our results extend previous observations showing a strong correlation between

134

neutralization potency and the presence of RBD-specific IgM (Beaudoin-Bussières et al., 2020;

135

Perera et al., 2020; Prévost et al., 2020; Seow et al., 2020). It is intriguing that IgM represents

136

about only 5% of the total antibodies in plasma (Wang et al., 2020), yet plays such an important

137

role in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Whether this is due to the enhanced avidity provided by its

138

pentameric nature remains to be formally demonstrated but is in agreement with recent work

139

demonstrating that dimeric antibodies are more potent than their monomeric counterpart (Wang

140

et al., 2020). The possible establishment of long lived IgM-producing B cells that might

141

contribute to long term immunity of recovered patients has been suggested (Brouwer et al.,

142

2020; Newell et al., 2020). However, how plasma neutralization evolves over prolonged periods

143

of time and the specific role of IgM in this activity remains to be determined.

Ethics statement

223

All work was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki in terms of informed

224

consent and approval by an appropriate Ethics Review board. Convalescent plasmas were

225

obtained from donors who consented to participate in this research project at CHUM (19.381)

226

and at Héma-Québec (REB # 2020-004). The donors met all donor eligibility criteria: previous

227

confirmed COVID-19 infection and complete resolution of symptoms for at least 14 days.

228
229

Plasmids

230

The plasmids expressing the human coronavirus Spike of SARS-CoV-2 was kindly provided

231

by Stefan Pöhlmann and was previously reported (Hoffmann et al., 2020). The pNL4.3 R-E-

232

Luc was obtained from NIH AIDS Reagent Program. The codon-optimized RBD sequence

233

(encoding residues 319-541) fused to a C-terminal hexahistidine tag was cloned into the

234

pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector and was reported elsewhere (Beaudoin-Bussières et al., 2020).

235

The vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G)-encoding plasmid (pSVCMV-IN-VSV-G) was

236

previously described (Lodge et al., 1997).

237
238

Cell lines

239

293T human embryonic kidney cells (obtained from ATCC) and Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-

240

1586™) were maintained at 37°C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium

241

(DMEM) (Wisent) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (VWR), 100 UI/ml of penicillin and

242

100μg/ml of streptomycin (Wisent). The 293T-ACE2 cell line was previously reported (Prévost

243

et al., 2020). For the generation of 293T cells stably expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike, VSV-G

244

pseudotyped lentivirus packaging the SARS-CoV-2 Spike was produced in 293T using a third-

11

245

generation lentiviral vector system. Briefly, 293T cells were co-transfected with two packaging

246

plasmids (pLP1 and pLP2), an envelope plasmid (pSVCMV-IN-VSV-G) and a lentiviral

247

transfer plasmid coding for a GFP-tagged SARS-CoV-2 Spike (pLV-SARS-CoV-2 S C-

248

GFPSpark tag) (SinoBiological). Supernatant containing lentiviral particles was used to infect

249

293T cells in presence of 5µg/mL polybrene. The 293T cells stably expressing SARS-CoV-2

250

Spike (GFP+) were sorted by flow cytometry. SARS-CoV-2 expression was confirmed using

251

the CR3022 mAb and plasma from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals.

252
253

Isotype depletion

254

Selective depletion of IgM, IgA or IgG was done by adsorption on isotype-specific ligands

255

immobilized on sepharose or agarose beads starting with a five-fold dilution of plasma in PBS.

256

IgG and IgA antibodies were depleted from plasma obtained from 25 recovered COVID-19

257

patient using Protein G HP Spintrap (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) and

258

Peptide M / Agarose (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA), respectively, according to the

259

manufacturer’s instructions with the exception that no elution step for the recovery of the

260

targeted antibodies was done. For IgM depletion, anti-human IgM (µ-chain specific, Sigma,

261

St.Louis, MO) was covalently coupled to NHS HP SpinTrap (GE Healthcare) at 815 µg/mL of

262

matrix. Depletion was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions with the

263

exception that no elution step for the recovery of the targeted isotype was done. All non-

264

depleted and isotype-depleted samples were filtered on a 0.22 µm Millex GV filter

265

(SLGV013SL, Millipore, Burlington, MA) to ensure sterility for the virus capture and

266

neutralization assays.

Immunoglobulin isotype ELISA

271

To assess the extent of IgM, IgG and IgA depletion, ELISA were performed on non-depleted

272

as well as IgM-, IgA- and IgG-depleted plasma samples. Each well of a 96-well microplate was

273

filled with either goat anti-human IgM (µ-chain specific) at 5 µg/mL, goat anti-human serum

274

IgA (-chain specific) at 0.3 µg/mL or goat anti-human IgG (γ-chain specific) at 5 µg/mL (all

275

from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Microtiter plates were

276

sealed and stored overnight at 2- 8°C. After four (IgA) to six (IgM and IgG) washes with H2O-

277

0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma), 200 μL of blocking solution (10 mmol/L phosphate buffer, pH 7.4,

278

containing 0.85% NaCl, 0.25% Hammerstein casein (EMD Chemicals Inc., Gibbstown, NJ,)

279

were added to each well to block any remaining binding sites. The blocking solution for the

280

IgG and IgM ELISA also contained 0.05% Tween 20. After 0.5 (IgA) to 1h (IgM and IgG)

281

incubation at 37°C and washes, samples and the standard curves (prepared with human

282

283

triplicates. Plates were incubated for 1h at 37°C. After washes, 100 µL of either goat anti-human

287

for 1h. Wells were washed and bound antibodies were detected by the addition of 100 µL of

288

3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzimidine (TMB, ScyTek Laboratories, Logan, UT). The enzymatic

289

SARS-CoV-2 RBD ELISA

295

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies in the plasma from 25 recovered

296

COVID-19 patients before and after depletion was measured using an ELISA adapted from a

297

recently described protocol (Beaudoin-Bussières et al., 2020; Perreault et al., 2020; Prévost et

298

al., 2020). The plasmid encoding for SARS-CoV-2 RBD was synthesized commercially

299

(Genscript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Recombinant RBD proteins were produced in transfected

300

FreeStyle 293F cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and purified by nickel affinity

301

chromatography. Recombinant RBD was diluted to 2.5 µg/mL in PBS (Thermo Fisher

302

Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 100 µl of the dilution was distributed in the wells of flat-

303

bottom 96-well microplates (Immulon 2HB; Thermo Scientific). The plates were placed

304

overnight at 2-8°C for antigen adsorption. For the assay, the plates were emptied and a volume

305

of 300 µl/well of blocking buffer (PBS-0.1% Tween (Sigma)-2% BSA (Sigma)) was added.

306

The microplates were incubated for one hour at room temperature (RT) followed by washing

307

four times (ELx405 microplate washer, Bio-Tek) with 300 µL/well of washing solution (PBS-

308

0.1% Tween). Because the reaction is time sensitive, samples, negative and positive controls

309

were prepared in triplicates in a plate, then transferred in the RBD coated plate by reverse multi-

310

pipetting. The negative control was prepared from a pool of 23 COVID negative plasmas while

311

the positive control was a characterized plasma from a recovered patient. After transfer, the

312

plates were incubated for 60 minutes at 20-24°C. After four washes, 100 µL of either goat anti-

313

human IgA+G+M (H+L) HRP conjugate (1/30 000) for the detection of all isotypes, goat anti-

314

human IgM (μ-chain specific) HRP conjugate (1/15 000), F(ab')₂ fragment goat anti-human

315

IgA (α-chain specific) HRP conjugate (1/4500) (all from Jackson Immunosearch Laboratories,

316

Inc.) or goat anti-human IgG (-chain specific) HRP conjugate (1/50 000) (Invitrogen) were

317

added and samples were incubated at 20-24°C for 60 minutes. Wells were washed four times

318

and bound antibodies were detected by the addition of 100 µL of 3,3′,5,5′-

tetramethylbenzimidine (ScyTek Laboratories). The enzymatic reaction was stopped by the

320

addition of 100 µL 1 N H2SO4 and the absorbance was measured at 450/630 nm within 5

321

minutes.

Flow cytometry analysis of cell-surface staining

324

293T cells stably expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike with a C-GFP tag (293T-Spike) were mixed

325

at a 1:1 ratio with non-transduced 293T cells and were stained with plasma from SARS-CoV-

326

2-infected individuals (1:250 dilution). Plasma binding to cell-surface Spike was revealed using

327

fluorescent secondary antibodies able to detect all Ig isotypes (anti-human IgM+IgG+IgA;

328

Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) or specific to IgG isotype (Biolegend), IgM

329

isotype

330

ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). The living cell population was gated on the basis of a

331

viability dye staining (Aqua Vivid, Invitrogen). Samples were acquired on a LSRII cytometer

332

(BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada) and data analysis was performed using FlowJo

333

v10.5.3 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). The signal obtained with 293T (GFP- population) was

334

subtracted from the signal obtained with 293T-Spike (GFP+ population) to remove unspecific

335

signal.

Neutralization assay using pseudoviral particles

338

Target cells were infected with single-round luciferase-expressing lentiviral particles as

339

described previously (Prévost et al., 2020). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected by the calcium

340

phosphate method with the lentiviral vector pNL4.3 R-E- Luc (NIH AIDS Reagent Program)

341

and a plasmid encoding for SARS-CoV-2 Spike at a ratio of 5:4. Two days post-transfection,

342

cell supernatants were harvested and stored at –80°C until use. 293T-ACE2 target cells were

343

seeded at a density of 1×104 cells/well in 96-well luminometer-compatible tissue culture plates

(Perkin Elmer) 24h before infection. Recombinant viruses in a final volume of 100μl were

345

incubated with the indicated plasma dilutions (1/50; 1/250; 1/1250; 1/6250; 1/31 250) for 1h at

346

37°C and were then added to the target cells followed by incubation for 48h at 37°C; cells were

347

lysed by the addition of 30μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega) followed by one freeze-thaw

348

cycle. An LB941 TriStar luminometer (Berthold Technologies) was used to measure the

349

luciferase activity of each well after the addition of 100μl of luciferin buffer (15mM MgSO4,

350

15mM KPO4 [pH 7.8], 1mM ATP, and 1mM dithiothreitol) and 50μl of 1mM d-luciferin

351

potassium salt (Prolume). The neutralization half-maximal inhibitory dilution (ID50) represents

352

the sera dilution to inhibit 50% of the infection of 293T-ACE2 cells by recombinant viruses.

353
354

Microneutralization assay using live SARS-CoV-2 viral particles

355

A microneutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2 serology was performed as previously described

356

(Amanat et al., 2020). The assay was conducted with the person blinded to the sample identity.

357

Experiments were conducted with the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 virus strain. This reagent

358

was deposited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and obtained through BEI

359

Resources, NIAID, NIH: SARS-Related Coronavirus 2, Isolate USA-WA1/2020, NR-52281.

360

One day prior to infection, 2x104 Vero E6 cells were seeded per well of a 96 well flat bottom

361

plate and incubated overnight (37°C/5% CO2) to permit Vero E6 cell adherence. On the day of

362

infection, all plasma samples were heat inactivated at 56°C for one hour. Non-depleted plasma

363

from each donor was also included in this assay. Plasma dilutions were performed in a separate

364

96 well culture plate using MEM supplemented with penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100

365

μg/mL), HEPES, L-Glutamine (0.3 mg/mL), 0.12% sodium bicarbonate, 2% FBS (all from

366

Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.24% BSA (EMD Millipore Corporation). Plasma dilutions

367

ranged from 1:50 to 1:31 250. In a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory (ImPaKT Facility, Western

368

University), 103 TCID50/mL SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 virus strain was prepared in MEM

+ 2% FBS and combined with an equivalent volume of respective plasma dilution for one hour

370

at room temperature. After this incubation, all media was removed from the 96 well plate seeded

371

with Vero E6 cells and virus:plasma mixtures were added to each respective well at a volume

372

corresponding to 600 TCID50 per well and incubated for one hour further at 37°C. Both virus

373

only and media only (MEM + 2% FBS) conditions were included in this assay. All virus:plasma

374

supernatants were removed from wells without disrupting the Vero E6 monolayer. Each plasma

375

dilution (100 μL) was added to its respective Vero E6-seeded well in addition to an equivalent

376

volume of MEM + 2% FBS and was then incubated for 48 hours. Media was then discarded

377

and replaced with 10% formaldehyde for 24 hours to cross-link Vero E6 monolayer.

378

Formaldehyde was removed from wells and subsequently washed with PBS. Cell monolayers

379

were permeabilized for 15 minutes at room temperature with PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 (BDH

380

Laboratory Reagents), washed with PBS and then incubated for one hour at room temperature

381

with PBS + 3% non-fat milk. An anti-mouse SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (Clone 1C7,

382

Bioss Antibodies) primary antibody solution was prepared at 1 μg/mL in PBS + 1% non-fat

383

milk and added to all wells for one hour at room temperature. Following extensive washing

384

with PBS, an anti-mouse IgG HRP secondary antibody solution was formulated in PBS + 1%

385

non-fat milk. One hour post-room temperature incubation, wells were washed with PBS,

386

SIGMAFAST™ OPD developing solution (Millipore Sigma) was prepared as per

387

manufacturer’s instructions and added to each well for 12 minutes. Dilute HCl (3.0 M) was

388

added to quench the reaction and the optical density at 490 nm of the culture plates was

389

immediately measured using a Synergy LX multi-mode reader and Gen5™ microplate reader

390

and imager software (BioTek®).
