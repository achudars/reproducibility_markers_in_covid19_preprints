Summary

40

A SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is needed to control the global COVID-19 public health crisis. Atomic-

41

level structures directed the application of prefusion-stabilizing mutations that improved

42

expression and immunogenicity of betacoronavirus spike proteins. Using this established

43

immunogen design, the release of SARS-CoV-2 sequences triggered immediate rapid

44

manufacturing of an mRNA vaccine expressing the prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike

45

trimer (mRNA-1273). Here, we show that mRNA-1273 induces both potent neutralizing antibody

46

and CD8 T cell responses and protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection in lungs and noses of

47

mice without evidence of immunopathology. mRNA-1273 is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial

48

with a trajectory towards Phase 3 efficacy evaluation.

49

Since its emergence in December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

50

(SARS-CoV-2) has accounted for over 7 million cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-

51

19) worldwide in less than 7 months1. SARS-CoV-2 is the third novel betacoronavirus in the last

52

20 years to cause substantial human disease; however, unlike its predecessors SARS-CoV and

53

MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 transmits efficiently from person-to-person. In absence of a vaccine,

54

public health measures such as quarantining newly diagnosed cases, contact tracing, and

55

mandating face masks and physical distancing have been instated to reduce transmission2. It is

56

estimated that until 60-70% population immunity is established, it is unlikely for COVID-19 to be

57

controlled well enough to resume normal activities. If immunity remains solely dependent on

58

infection, even at a 1% mortality rate, >40 million people could succumb to COVID-19 globally3.

59

Therefore, rapid development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is critical for changing the

60

global dynamic of this virus.

61

The spike (S) protein, a class I fusion glycoprotein analogous to influenza hemagglutinin (HA),

62

respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion glycoprotein (F), and human immunodeficiency virus

63

(HIV) gp160 (Env), is the major surface protein on the CoV virion and the primary target for

64

neutralizing antibodies. S proteins undergo dramatic structural rearrangement to fuse virus and

65

host cell membranes, allowing delivery of the viral genome into target cells. We previously

66

showed that prefusion-stabilized protein immunogens that preserve neutralization-sensitive

67

epitopes are an effective vaccine strategy for enveloped viruses, such as RSV4-8. Subsequently,

68

we identified 2 proline substitutions (2P) at the apex of the central helix and heptad repeat 1 that

69

effectively stabilized MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 S proteins in the prefusion

70

conformation9-11. Similar to other prefusion-stabilized fusion proteins, MERS S-2P protein is

71

more immunogenic at lower doses than wild-type S protein11. The 2P has been widely

72

transferrable to other beta-CoV spike proteins, suggesting a generalizable approach for

73

designing stabilized prefusion beta-CoV S vaccine antigens. This is fundamental to the

74

prototype pathogen approach for pandemic preparedness12,13.

75

Coronaviruses have long been predicted to have a high likelihood of spill over into humans and

76

cause future pandemics14,15. As part of our pandemic preparedness efforts, we have studied

77

MERS-CoV as prototype pathogen for betacoronaviruses to optimize vaccine design, to dissect

78

the humoral immune response to vaccination, and identify mechanisms and correlates of

79

protection. Achieving an effective and rapid vaccine response to a newly emerging virus

80

requires the precision afforded by structure-based antigen design but also a manufacturing

81

platform to shorten time to product availability. Producing cell lines and clinical grade subunit

82

protein typically takes more than 1 year, while manufacturing nucleic acid vaccines can be done

83

in a matter of weeks16,17. In addition to advantages in manufacturing speed, mRNA vaccines are

84

potently immunogenic and elicit both humoral and cellular immunity18-20. Therefore, we

85

evaluated mRNA formulated in lipid nanoparticles (mRNA/LNP) as a delivery vehicle for the

86

MERS S-2P and found that transmembrane-anchored MERS S-2P mRNA elicited better

87

neutralizing antibody responses than secreted MERS S-2P (Extended Data Fig. 1a).

88

Additionally, consistent with protein immunogens, MERS S-2P mRNA was more immunogenic

89

than MERS wild-type S mRNA (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Immunization with MERS S-2P

90

mRNA/LNP elicited potent neutralizing activity down to a 0.1 µg dose and protected hDPP4

91

transgenic (288/330+/+21) mice against lethal MERS-CoV challenge in a dose-dependent

92

manner, establishing proof-of-concept that mRNA expressing the stabilized S-2P protein is

93

protective. Notably, the sub-protective 0.01 µg dose of MERS S-2P mRNA did not cause

94

exaggerated disease following MERS-CoV infection, but instead resulted in partial protection

95

against weight loss followed by full recovery without evidence of enhanced illness (Fig. 1).

96

In early January 2020, a novel CoV (nCoV) was identified as the cause of a respiratory virus

97

outbreak occurring in Wuhan, China. Within 24 hours of the release of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.11.145920; this version posted June 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

98

sequences (then known as “2019-nCoV”) on January 10th, the 2P mutations were substituted

99

into S positions aa986 and 987 to produce prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S (S-2P) protein

100

for structural analysis22 and serological assay development23,24 in silico without additional

101

experimental validation. Within 5 days of sequence release, current Good Manufacturing

102

Practice (cGMP) production of mRNA/LNP expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S-2P as a

103

transmembrane-anchored protein with the native furin cleavage site (mRNA-1273) was initiated

104

in parallel with preclinical evaluation. Remarkably, this led to the start of a first in human Phase

105

1 clinical trial on March 16, 2020, 66 days after the viral sequence was released, and a Phase 2

106

began 74 days later on May 29, 2020 (Extended Data Fig. 2). Prior to vaccination of the first

107

human subject, expression and antigenicity of the S-2P antigen delivered by mRNA was

108

confirmed in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 3), and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 was

109

documented in several mouse strains. The results of those studies are detailed hereafter.

110

Immunogenicity was assessed in six-week old female BALB/cJ, C57BL/6J, and B6C3F1/J mice

111

by immunizing intramuscularly (IM) twice with 0.01, 0.1, or 1 µg of mRNA-1273 at a 3-week

112

interval. mRNA-1273 induced dose-dependent S-specific binding antibodies after prime and

113

boost in all mouse strains (Fig. 2a-c). Potent neutralizing activity was elicited by 1 µg of mRNA-

114

1273, reaching 819, 89, and 1115 reciprocal IC50 geometric mean titer (GMT) for BALB/cJ,

115

C57BL/6J, and B6C3F1/J mice, respectively (Fig. 2d-f). These levels are similar to the

116

neutralization activity achieved by immunizing with 1 µg of SAS-adjuvanted S-2P protein

117

(Extended Data Table 1). To further gauge immunogenicity across a wide dose range,

118

BALB/cJ mice were immunized with 0.0025 – 20 µg of mRNA-1273 revealing a strong positive

119

correlation between dose-dependent mRNA-1273-elicited binding and neutralizing antibody

120

responses (Extended Data Fig. 4). BALB/cJ mice that received a single dose of mRNA-1273

121

were evaluated in order to ascertain the utility for a one-dose vaccine regimen. S-binding

122

antibodies were induced in mice immunized with one dose of 1 or 10 µg of mRNA-1273, and the

123

10 µg dose elicited neutralizing antibody activity that increased between week 2 and week 4,

124

reaching 315 reciprocal IC50 GMT (Extended Data Fig. 5a-b). These data demonstrate that

125

mRNA expressing SARS-CoV-2 S-2P is a potent immunogen and neutralizing activity can be

126

elicited with a single dose.

127

Next, we evaluated the balance of Th1 and Th2, because vaccine-

128

associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) has been associated with Th2-biased

129

immune responses in children immunized with whole-inactivated virus vaccines against RSV

130

and measles virus25,26. A similar phenomenon has also been reported in some animal models

131

with whole-inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines27. Thus, we first compared levels of S-specific

132

IgG2a/c and IgG1, which are surrogates of Th1 and Th2 responses respectively, elicited by

133

mRNA-1273 to those elicited by SARS-CoV-2 S-2P protein adjuvanted with the TLR4-agonist

134

Sigma Adjuvant System (SAS). Both immunogens elicited IgG2a and IgG1 subclass S-binding

135

antibodies, indicating a balanced Th1/Th2 response (Fig. 3a-c; Extended Data Fig. 6). The S-

136

specific IgG subclass profile following a single dose of mRNA-1273 (Extended Data Fig. 5c)

137

was similar to that observed following two doses. In contrast, Th2-biased antibodies with lower

138

IgG2a/IgG1 subclass response ratios were observed in mice immunized with SARS-CoV-2 S

139

protein formulated in alum (Extended Data Fig. 7a-b). Following re-stimulation with peptide

140

pools (S1 and S2) corresponding to the S protein, splenocytes from mRNA-1273-immunized

141

mice secreted more IFN-γ than IL-4, IL-5, or IL-13 whereas SARS-CoV-2 S protein with alum

142

induced Th2-skewed cytokine secretion (Extended Data Fig. 7c-d). 7 weeks post-boost, we

143

also directly measured cytokine patterns in vaccine-induced memory T cells by intracellular

144

cytokine staining (ICS); mRNA-1273-elicited CD4+ T cells re-stimulated with S1 or S2 peptide

145

pools exhibited a Th1-dominant response, particularly at higher immunogen doses (Fig. 3d-e).

146

Furthermore, 1 µg of mRNA-1273 induced a robust CD8+ T cell response to the S1 peptide pool

147

(Fig. 3f-g). The Ig subclass and T cell cytokine data together demonstrate that immunization

148

with mRNA-1273 elicits a balanced Th1/Th2 response in contrast to the Th2-biased response

149

seen with S protein adjuvanted with alum, suggesting that mRNA vaccination avoids Th2-biased

150

immune responses that have been linked to VAERD.

151

Protective immunity was assessed in young adult BALB/cJ mice challenged with mouse-

152

adapted (MA) SARS-CoV-2 that exhibits viral replication localized to lungs and nasal

153

turbinates28. BALB/cJ mice that received two 1 μg doses of mRNA-1273 were completely

154

protected from viral replication in lungs after challenge at a 5- (Fig. 4a) or 13-week intervals

155

following boost (Extended Data Fig. 8a). mRNA-1273-induced immunity also rendered viral

156

replication in nasal turbinates undetectable in 6 out of 7 mice (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 8b).

157

Efficacy of mRNA-1273 was dose-dependent, with two 0.1 μg mRNA-1273 doses reducing lung

158

viral load by ~100-fold and two 0.01 μg mRNA-1273 doses reducing lung viral load by ~3-fold

159

(Fig. 4a). Of note, mice challenged 7 weeks after a single dose of 1 μg or 10 μg of mRNA-1273

160

were also completely protected against lung viral replication (Fig. 4c). Challenging animals

161

immunized with sub-protective doses provides an orthogonal assessment of safety signals,

162

such as increased clinical illness or pathology. Similar to what was observed with MERS-CoV S-

163

2P mRNA, mice immunized with sub-protective 0.1 and 0.01 µg mRNA-1273 doses showed no

164

evidence of enhanced lung pathology or excessive mucus production (Fig. 4d). In summary,

165

mRNA-1273 is immunogenic, efficacious, and does not show evidence of promoting VAERD

166

when given at sub-protective doses in mice.

167

Here, we showed that 1 μg of mRNA-1273 was sufficient to induce robust neutralizing activity

168

and CD8 T cell responses, balanced Th1/Th2 antibody isotype responses, and protection from

169

viral replication for more than 3 months following a prime/boost regimen similar to that being

170

tested in humans. Inclusion of lower sub-protective doses demonstrated the dose-dependence

171

of antibody, Th1 CD4 T cell responses, and protection, suggesting immune correlates of

172

protection can be further elucidated. A major goal of animal studies to support SARS-CoV-2

173

vaccine candidates through clinical trials is to not only prove elicitation of potent protective

174

immune responses, but to show that sub-protective responses do not cause VAERD3. Sub-

175

protective doses did not prime mice for enhanced immunopathology following challenge.

176

Moreover, the induction of protective immunity following a single dose suggests that

177

consideration could be given to administering one dose of this vaccine in the outbreak setting.

178

These data, combined with immunogenicity data from nonhuman primates and subjects in early

179

Phase 1 clinical trials, will be used to inform the dose and regimen of mRNA-1273 in advanced

180

clinical efficacy trials.

181

The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 is the Pathogen X event that has long been predicted12,13.

182

Here, we provide a paradigm for rapid vaccine development. Structure-guided stabilization of

183

the MERS-CoV S protein combined with a fast, scalable, and safe mRNA/LNP vaccine platform

184

led to a generalizable beta-CoV vaccine solution that translated into a commercial mRNA

185

vaccine delivery platform, paving the way for the rapid response to the COVID-19 outbreak. This

186

is a demonstration of how the power of new technology-driven concepts like synthetic

187

vaccinology facilitate a vaccine development program that can be initiated with pathogen

188

sequences alone11. It is also a proof-of-concept for the prototype pathogen approach for

189

pandemic preparedness and response that is predicated on identifying generalizable solutions

190

for medical countermeasures within virus families or genera12. Even though the response to the

191

COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in its speed and breadth, we envision a response that

192

could be quicker. There are 24 other virus families known to infect humans, and with sustained

193

investigation of those potential threats, we could be better prepared for future looming

194

pandemics13.

Methods

236

MERS-CoV S-2P and SARS-CoV-2 S-2P mRNA synthesis and lipid nanoparticle formulation

237

For each vaccine, T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription was used in vitro to synthesize

238

the mRNA from a linearized DNA template, which flanked the immunogen open-reading frames

239

with the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions and a poly-A tail as described previously 29. mRNA was

240

then purified, diluted in citrate buffer to the desired concentration and encapsulated into lipid

241

nanoparticles (LNP) by ethanol drop nanoprecipitation. At molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5

242

(ionizable lipid:DSPC:cholesterol:PEG-lipid), lipids were dissolved in ethanol and combined with

243

a 6.25-mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5) containing mRNA at a ratio of 3:1 (aqueous:ethanol).

244

Formulations were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for at least 18 hr,

245

concentrated using Amicon ultracentrifugal filters (EMD Millipore), passed through a 0.22-μm

246

filter and stored at -20°C until use. All formulations underwent quality control for particle size,

RNA encapsulation, and endotoxin. LNP were between 80 – 100 nm in size, with > 90%

248

encapsulation on mRNA and < 10 EU/mL endotoxin.

249

MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV Protein Expression and Purification

250

Vectors encoding MERS-CoV S-2P11 and SARS-CoV S-2P22 were generated as previously

252

plasmids into Expi293 cells using Expifectamine transfection reagent (ThermoFisher) in

253

suspension at 37°C for 4-5 days. Transfected cell culture supernatants were collected, buffer

254

exchanged into 1X PBS, and protein was purified using Strep-Tactin resin (IBA). For proteins

255

used for mouse inoculations, tags were cleaved with addition of HRV3C protease

Expi293 cells were maintained in manufacturer’s suggested media.

279

In vitro mRNA Expression

280

HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with mRNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 WT S or S-2P

281

protein using a TranIT mRNA transfection kit (Mirus). After 24 hr, the cells were harvested and

282

resuspended in FACS buffer (1X PBS, 3% FBS, 0.05% sodium azide). To detect surface protein

283

expression, the cells were stained with 10 µg/mL ACE2-FLAG (Sigma) or CR302230 in FACS

284

buffer for 30 min on ice. Thereafter, cells were washed twice in FACS buffer and incubated with

285

FITC anti-FLAG (Sigma) or Alexafluor 647 goat anti-human IgG (Southern Biotech) in FACS

286

buffer for 30 min on ice. Live/Dead aqua fixable stain (Invitrogen) were utilized to assess

287

viability. Data acquisition was performed on a BD LSRII Fortessa instrument (BD Biosciences)

288

and analyzed by FlowJo software v10 (Tree Star, Inc.)

295

1X PBS, and mice were inoculated IM into the same hind leg for both prime and boost. For all

296

SARS-CoV-2 S-P protein vaccinations, mice were inoculated IM, with SAS, as previously

297

detailed11. For S + alum immunizations, SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Sino Biological) + 250 µg alum

298

hydrogel was delivered IM. For challenge studies to evaluate MERS-CoV-2 vaccines, 16-20-

299

week-old 288/330+/+mice21 were immunized. Four weeks post-boost, pre-challenge sera were

300

collected from a subset of mice, and remaining mice were challenged with 5x105 PFU of a

301

mouse-adapted MERS-CoV EMC derivative, m35c431. On day 3 post-challenge, lungs were

302

harvested, and hemorrhage and viral titer were assessed, per previously published methods32.

303

For challenge studies to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, BALB/cJ mice were challenged with

304

105 PFU of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 MA). On day 2 post-challenge, lungs

305

and nasal turbinates were harvested for viral titer assessment, per previously published

306

methods28.

307

Histology

308

Lungs from mice were collected at the indicated study endpoints and placed in 10% neutral

309

buffered formalin (NBF) until adequately fixed. Thereafter, tissues were trimmed to a thickness

310

of 3-5 mm, processed and paraffin embedded. The respective paraffin tissue blocks

311

were sectioned at 5 µm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). All sections were

312

examined by a board-certified veterinary pathologist using an Olympus BX51 light microscope

313

and photomicrographs were taken using an Olympus DP73 camera.

314

Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)

315

Nunc Maxisorp ELISA plates (ThermoFisher) were coated with 100 ng/well of protein in 1X PBS

316

at 4°C for 16 hr. Where applicable, to eliminate fold-on-specific binding from MERS S-2P- or

317

SARS-CoV-2 S-2P protein-immune mouse serum, 50 µg/mL of fold-on protein was added for 1

318

hr at room temperature (RT). After standard washes and blocks, plates were incubated with

319

serial dilutions of heat-inactivated (HI) sera for 1 hr at RT. Following washes, anti-mouse IgG,

320

IgG1, or IgG2a or IgG2c–horseradish peroxidase conjugates (ThermoFisher) were used as

321

secondary Abs, and 3,5,3′5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (KPL) was used as the substrate to

322

detect Ab responses. Endpoint titers were calculated as the dilution that emitted an optical

323

density exceeding 4X background (secondary Ab alone).

324

Pseudovirus Neutralization Assay

325

We introduced divergent amino acids, as predicted from translated sequences, into the CMV/R-

326

MERS-CoV EMC S (GenBank#: AFS88936) gene33 to generate a MERS-CoV m35c4 S gene31.

327

To produce SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses, a codon-optimized CMV/R-SARS-CoV-2 S (Wuhan-1,

328

Genbank #: MN908947.3) plasmid was constructed. Pseudoviruses were produced by co-

329

transfection of plasmids encoding a luciferase reporter, lentivirus backbone, and S genes into

330

HEK293T/17 cells (ATCC #CRL-11268), as previously described33. For SARS-CoV-2

331

pseudovirus, human transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) plasmid was also co-

332

transfected34. Pseudoneutralization assay methods have been previously described11. Briefly, HI

333

serum was mixed with pseudoviruses, incubated, and then added to Huh7.5 cells or ACE-2-

334

expressing 293T cells, for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 respectively. Seventy-two hr later, cells

335

were lysed, and luciferase activity (relative light units, RLU) was measured. Percent

336

neutralization was normalized considering uninfected cells as 100% neutralization and cells

337

infected with only pseudovirus as 0% neutralization. IC50 titers were determined using a log

338

(agonist) vs. normalized response (variable slope) nonlinear function in Prism v8 (GraphPad).

339

Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT)

340

HI sera were diluted in gelatin saline (0.3% [wt/vol] gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline

341

supplemented with CaCl2 and MgCl2) to generate a 1:5 dilution of the original specimen, which

342

served as a starting concentration for further serial log4 dilutions terminating in 1:81,920. Sera

343

were combined with an equal volume of SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1-

344

F6/2020 in gelatin saline, resulting in an average concentration of 730 plaque-forming units per

345

mL (determined from plaque counts of 24 individual wells of untreated virus) in each serum

346

dilution. Thus, final serum concentrations ranged from 1:10 to 1:163,840 of the original.

347

Virus/serum mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 37 ºC, followed by adsorption of 0.1 mL to

348

each of two confluent Vero E6 cell monolayers (in 10-cm2 wells) for 30 min at 37°C. Cell

349

monolayers were overlaid with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 1%

350

agar and incubated for 3 d at 37°C in humidified 5% CO2. Plaques were enumerated by direct

351

visualization. The average number of plaques in virus/serum (duplicate) and virus-only (24)

352

wells was used to generate percent neutralization curves according the following formula: 1 –

353

(ratio of mean number of plaques in the presence and absence of serum). The PRNT IC50 titer

354

was defined as the reciprocal serum dilution at which the neutralization curve crossed the 50%

355

threshold.

356

Intracellular Cytokine Staining

357

Mononuclear single cell suspensions from whole mouse spleens were generated using a

358

gentleMACS tissue dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) followed by 70 µm filtration and density gradient

359

centrifugation using Fico/Lite-LM medium (Atlanta Biologicals). Cells from each mouse were

360

resuspended in R10 media (RPMI 1640 supplemented with Pen-Strep antibiotic, 10% HI-FBS,

361

Glutamax, and HEPES) and incubated for 6 hr at 37°C with protein transport inhibitor cocktail

362

(eBioscience) under three conditions: no peptide stimulation, and stimulation with two spike

363

peptide pools (JPT product PM-WCPV-S-1). Peptide pools were used at a final concentration of

364

2 µg/mL each peptide. Cells from each group were pooled for stimulation with cell stimulation

365

cocktail (eBioscience) as a positive control. Following stimulation, cells were washed with PBS

366

prior to staining with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain (Invitrogen) for 20 min at RT.

367

Cells were then washed in FC buffer (PBS supplemented with 2% HI-FBS and 0.05% NaN3)

368

and resuspended in BD Fc Block (clone 2.4G2) for 5 min at RT prior to staining with a surface

369

stain cocktail containing the following antibodies purchased from BD and Biolegend: I-A/I-E

370

(M5/114.15.2) PE, CD8a (53-6.7) BUV805, CD44 (IM7) BUV395, CD62L (MEL-14) BV605, and

371

CD4 (RM4-5) BV480 in brilliant stain buffer (BD). After 15 min, cells were washed with FC buffer

372

then fixed and permeabilized using the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm fixation/permeabilization solution

373

kit according to manufacturer instructions. Cells were washed in perm/wash solution and

374

stained with Fc Block (5 min at RT), followed by intracellular staining (30 min at 4°C) using a

375

cocktail of the following antibodies purchased from BD, Biolegend, or eBioscience: CD3e (17A2)

376

BUV737, IFN-γ (XMG1.2) BV650, TNF-α (MP6-XT22) BV711, IL-2 (JES6-5H4) BV421, IL-4

377

(11B11) Alexa Fluor 488, and IL-5 (TRFK5) APC in 1x perm/wash diluted with brilliant stain

378

buffer. Finally, cells were washed in perm/wash solution and resuspended in 0.5% PFA-FC

379

stain buffer prior to running on a Symphony A5 flow cytometer (BD). Analysis was performed

380

using FlowJo software, version 10.6.2 according to the gating strategy outlined in Extended

381

Data Figure 9. Background cytokine expression in the no peptide condition was subtracted from

382

that measured in the S1 and S2 peptide pools for each individual mouse.

383

T Cell Stimulation and Cytokine Analysis

384

Spleens from immunized mice were collected 2 weeks post-boost. 2 x 106 splenocytes/well (96-

385

well plate) were stimulated in vitro with two peptide libraries, JPT1 and JPT2, (15mers with 11

386

aa overlap) covering the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (JPT product PM-WCPV-S-1). Both

387

peptide libraries were used at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL. After 24 hr of culture at 37°C, the

388

plates were centrifuged and supernatant was collected and frozen at -80°C for cytokine

389

detection. Measurements and analyses of secreted cytokines from a murine 35-plex kit were

390

performed using a multiplex bead-based technology (Luminex) assay with a Bio-Plex 200

391

instrument (Bio-Rad) after 2-fold dilution of supernatants.

10% formalin, paraffin-embedded, cut in 5 µm sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Photomicrographs (4X and 10X) are representative of lung sections from groups of mice in which
virus infection was detected. At day 2, lungs from mock-immunized mice demonstrated moderate
to severe, predominantly neutrophilic, inflammation that was present within, and surrounding,
small bronchioles (arrowheads); the surrounding alveolar capillaries were markedly expanded by
infiltrating inflammatory cells. In the 0.01 µg two-dose group, inflammation was minimal to absent.
In the 0.1 µg two-dose group, occasional areas of inflammation intimately associated with small
airways (bronchioles) and their adjacent vasculature (arrowheads) were seen, primarily
composed of neutrophils. In the single-dose 0.1 µg group, there were mild patchy expansion of
the alveolar septae by mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells. At day 4, lungs from mockimmunized mice exhibited moderate to marked expansion of the alveolar septae (interstitial
pattern) with decreased prominence of the adjacent alveolar spaces. In the 0.01 µg two-dose
group, inflammation was minimal to absent. Lungs in the 0.1 µg two-dose group showed mild,
predominantly lymphocytic inflammation, intimately associated with bronchioles and adjacent
vasculature (arrowheads). In the single-dose 0.1 µg group there was mild, predominantly
lymphocytic, inflammation around bronchovascular bundles (arrowheads).

Extended Data Figure 6. mRNA-1273 and SAS-adjuvanted S-2P protein elicit both IgG2a
and IgG1 subclass S-binding antibodies. BALB/cJ (a-c) or C57BL/6J (d-f) mice were
immunized at weeks 0 and 3 with 0.01 (green), 0.1 (blue), or 1 µg (red) of mRNA-1273 SARSCoV-2 S-2P protein adjuvanted with SAS. Sera were collected 2 weeks post-boost and assessed
by ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 S-specific IgG1 and IgG2a or IgG2c for BALB/cJ and C57BL/6J mice,
respectively. Endpoint titers (a-b, d-e) and endpoint titer ratios of IgG2a to IgG1 (c) and IgG2c to
IgG1 (f) were calculated. For mice for which endpoint titers did not reach the lower limit of
detection (dotted line), ratios were not calculated (N/A). IgG1 and IgG2a/c (a-b, d-e) and
immunogens (c, f) were compared at each dose level.

Extended Data Figure 7. mRNA-1273 elicits Th1-skewed responses compared to S protein
adjuvanted with alum. BALB/c mice were immunized at weeks 0 and 2 weeks with 1 (red) or 10
µg (purple) of mRNA-1273 or 10 µg of SARS-CoV-2 S protein adjuvanted with alum hydrogel
(orange). (a-b) Sera were collected 2 weeks post-boost and assessed by ELISA for SARS-CoV2 S-specific IgG1 and IgG2a. Endpoint titers (a) and endpoint titer ratios of IgG2a to IgG1 (b) were
calculated. (c-d) Splenocytes were also collected 4 weeks post-boost to evaluate IFN-γ IL-4, IL5, and IL-13 cytokine levels secreted by T cells re-stimulated with S1 (c) and S2 (d) peptide pools,
measured by Luminex. Dotted line = assay limit of detection. IgG1 and IgG2a/c (a) were compared
at each dose level. (c-d) For cytokines, all comparisons were compared to PBS-immunized mice.

Extended Data Figure 8. mRNA-1273 protects mice from upper and lower airway SARSCoV-2 infection, 13 weeks post-boost. BALB/cJ mice were immunized at weeks 0 and 3 with
0.01 (green), 0.1 (blue), or 1 µg (red) of mRNA-1273. Age-matched naive mice (gray) served as
controls. Thirteen weeks post-boost, mice were challenged with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2.
Two days post-challenge, at peak viral load, mouse lungs (a) and nasal turbinates (b) were
harvested from 5 mice per group for analysis of viral titers. Dotted line = assay limit of detection.
All dose levels were compared.
