Hidden in plain sight: The effects of BCG vaccination in COVID-19 pandemic

Abstract
To investigate the relationship between BCG vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 by bioinformatic approach. Two datasets for
Sars-CoV-2 infection group and BCG-vaccinated group were downloaded. Differentially Expressed Genes were identified.
Gene ontology and pathways were functionally enriched, and networking was constructed in NetworkAnalyst. Lastly,
correlation between post-BCG vaccination and COVID-19 transcriptome signatures were established. A total of 161 DEGs
(113 upregulated DEGs and 48 downregulated genes) were identified in the Sars-CoV-2 group. In the pathway enrichment
analysis, cross-reference of upregulated KEGG pathways in Sars-CoV-2 with downregulated counterparts in the BCGvaccinated group, resulted in the intersection of 45 common pathways, accounting for 86.5% of SARS-CoV-2 upregulated
pathways. Of these intersecting pathways, a vast majority were immune and inflammatory pathways with top significance
in IL-17, TNF, NOD-like receptors, and NF-κB signaling pathways. Our data suggests BCG-vaccination may incur a
protective role in COVID-19 patients until a targeted vaccine is developed.

INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus pandemic now affects over 2 million people with nearly 130,000 deaths reported thus far, resulting in
unprecedented ramifications on global health, social infrastructure, and economic trade. Since its emergence in Wuhan,
China in 2019, SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the disease, has spread rapidly across the globe
to over 185 countries. Curiously, the degree of intensity has varied markedly between countries - even those with similar
climates, geography, and/or healthcare infrastructure. The transmission pattern does not appear to follow previous SARSCoV virus transmission1 or climatic zones based on human transmission2-4 as temperate and tropical countries have reported
the disease5. The incidence of COVID-19 pandemic varies widely with the highest number of cases in the United States,
Italy, China and lowest in regions of the world historically vulnerable to infectious disease such as sub-Saharan Africa. The
disproportionately high morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 infection in some countries has been linked to several factors
including, but not limited to differences in efforts to mitigate the disease spread (i.e. social distancing, travel restrictions),
circulating SARS-CoV strains, and vaccination policies.
In order to confront COVID-19 disease, it is critical to characterize the virus’ biological and immunological pathways.
Recent studies have uncovered the mechanism of viral entry of the SARS-CoV-2 relies on human angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (hACE2) acting as the host cell receptor. hACE2 interacts with the glycoprotein spike (S) of SARS-CoV2 in
order to form a complex structure, a receptor-binding mode motif similar to some related viruses, including the one
responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)6-11. Another study, which analyzed the transcriptional changes
in the immune genes of 3 COVID patients, reported increased inflammatory responses to the virus, revealing increased Tcell activation and cytokine expression, indicating pro-inflammatory pathways may be prognostic markers and/or serve as
potential targets in COVID-19 disease12. Increased IL-6 expression and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) has also been
reported, furthering the notion that cytokines are playing a key role in COVID-induced pneumonia13. Other studies have
hypothesized that protection by the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination, which was originally developed to protect
against Tuberculosis (TB) disease, may be playing a critical immunological role against CoV-Sars-214-19.
The BCG is a century-old vaccine that is given as an attenuated live strain of Mycobacterium bovis used to confer immunity
against some strains of TB. Various studies have indicated that BCG vaccination has a role extending far beyond TB
treatment alone, eliciting non-specific effects (NSEs) within the innate immune system alongside the adaptive immune
response20. BCG vaccination has been identified for its protective role specifically against respiratory viral infections,
including Influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)21, and is the standard therapy for certain types of bladder
cancer. Although the exact mechanism remains elusive, BCG-protection is thought to be conferred by epigenetic and
immunological moderation of the immune response through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and
IFNγ) and the role of Vitamin D22-24. One such proposed mechanism behind the protective effects of BCG-vaccination
heavily implicates the role of Vitamin D. During antimicrobial response (such as in M.tb infection), toll-like receptors
(TLRs) upregulate the expression of VDR on immune cells and pulmonary epithelial cells. VDR then binds to calcitriol, the
active form of Vitamin D, and together regulates the transcriptional activity of several antimicrobial peptides such as
cathelicidin and beta-defensin25-28. Vitamin D alters T-cell activation and IFN-gamma stimulation, increasing the
expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Overall, the non-specific effects following BCG vaccination are

conferred by epigenetic and transcriptional modulation of the innate immune system as evidenced by its far-reaching role in
several viral infections.
Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that countries with nationalized BCG vaccination policies show decreased morbidity
and mortality to COVID-19 when compared to those where no such uniform policy exists (such as the United States or
Italy); however, these preliminary data is limited given it is yet to be peer-reviewed and fails to account for several
confounding factors such as age, testing rates29,30, and the accuracy of the BGC World Atlas31(http://www.bcgatlas.org/).
Nonetheless, given the safety of BCG vaccination and the well characterized role of NSEs, it is theorized that BCG can
serve as a temporary and safe solution until a targeted vaccination becomes available. Currently, four clinical trials are
already underway in Australia, Netherlands, and the United States involving BCG vs placebo-controlled trials in health care
workers involved in Covid-19 patient care (ClinicalTrial.gov; NCT04347876, NCT04327206, NCT04328441,
NCT04348370). Further, there is an additional observational study in Egypt for tuberculin positivity in COVID-19 patients
vs COVID-19 negative, BCG-vaccinated parallel cohort (NCT04350931).
Overall, the far-reaching effects of BCG vaccination testify to its dynamic role: eliciting NSEs, curbing inflammation in
cancer models, and reducing viremia in several distinct pathogens, including RSV, Influenza A, yellow fever, and herpes
simplex virus21,32. Our inclination is that BCG vaccination may provide putative immunity against COVID-19 until a
targeted vaccine can be well studied and mass produced. Altogether, this study aims to elucidate the relationship between
BCG vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 through bioinformatic analysis of biological and immunological pathways underlying
both.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data Source
The microarray data analyzed in this study were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), accession number GSE147507, published on March 25th, 2020. This data set analyzed
gene expression profile of a normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cell line, derived from a 79-year-old Caucasian
female, after SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. The following samples were analyzed; SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE cells
(GSM4432381, GSM4432382, GSM4432383) compared to mock treated NHBE cells (GSM4432378, GSM4432379,
GSM4432380).
To compare the transcriptomic alterations in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection with host immune response following
administration of BCG vaccine, the RNA sequencing data (GSE87186) was retrieved from the SRA database
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE87186) in Biojupies Analysis Notebook
(https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/biojupies/analyze) and processed by ARCHS4 (all RNA-seq and ChIP-seq sample and
signature search) pipeline (https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/archs4)33. In this dataset, the immunogenicity of a recombinant
BCG vaccine in healthy BCG-naïve adults and who were negative for prior exposure to M.tb was evaluated. We analyzed
40 samples of 8 adult vaccine recipients at 5 different timing post-vaccination; representing day 0, day 14, day 28, day 56,
and day 84 (GSM2324141-GSM2324180). Separate analysis was first performed followed by combined analysis.

Data pre‑processing and differential expression analysis
After background correction of raw expression data, mapped multiple probes to the same genes were summarized to gene
levels by using the median. Genes were filtered out if variance percentile rank lower than the threshold (set at 15%) or low
relative abundance (average expression signal) below 5%. To ensure similar expression distributions of each sample across
the entire experiment, normalization by log2 transformation method was performed. The quality of the normalized dataset
was checked with the box plot and density plot, and the Benjamini and Hochberg method was selected for the multiple
testing correction. Using the Limma R package available on Bioconductor
(http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html), differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in
the microarray dataset. Genes with false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 and log 2 -fold change (FC) ≥1.0 were considered as
significantly differentially expressed and subjected to further analysis. For the RNA seq data of BCG vaccine, gene
expression signature was generated by comparing gene expression levels of the post-vaccination groups with the control
group at day 0. Altered patterns of gene expression were defined through each experimental time (FC>1|P<0.05). To
visually identify the similarities and differences between different cell line samples, principal component analysis (PCA)
was plotted to project high-dimensional data into lower dimensions using linear transformation.
Functional Enrichment Analysis
Gene Ontology (GO) database for function annotation of genes was used to analyze the DEGs at the functional level in
terms of biological processes, molecular function, and cellular component domains34. Pathway functional analysis was
performed in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, Wikipathway, and reactome pathways 35.
The significantly overrepresented GO and pathways of the up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs were identified by The
Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database version 11.0 (https://string-db.org/) and validated in
Enrichr website (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/)36 with p value <0.05 as a cut-off criterion.
Protein-protein interaction network construction
The STRING database was used to construct protein interaction pairs of the screened DEGs based on their function and
scores. Setting was adjusted with high confidence (combined score) >0.9 and existence of experimental evidence. The
network was visualized in Network Analyst (https://www.networkanalyst.ca/), a visual analytics platform for
comprehensive gene expression profiling with the following threshold; degree distribution of 20 and betweenness at 10.
The hub nodes in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were then identified based on the connectivity degree in the
network statistics (number of neighbors).
Gene regulatory networks
Gene-miRNA Interactome was constructed from experimentally validated miRNA-gene interaction data collected from
TarBase v7.0 (http://diana.imis.athena-innovation.gr/) and miRTarBase (http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/) databases and
plotted in Network Analyst. Potential transcription factors (TFs) among DEGs were first screened in the Panther
(http://pantherdb.org/), JASPAR TF binding site profile database (http://jaspar.genereg.net/) and the ENCODE ChIP-seq
data (https://www.encodeproject.org/chip-seq/transcription_factor/). In addition, upstream regulatory networks for the
DEGs were built, and inferred networks combining transcription factor enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction
network expansion with kinase enrichment analysis was constructed in Expression2Kinase web application
(http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/X2K/).

Correlations between post-vaccination host immune response and COVID transcriptome signatures
Through KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, down-regulated KEGG signaling pathways following BCG vaccination were
intersected with up-regulated pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infection using Venny 2.1.0
(https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). Deregulated genes in each pathway were explored and the direction of
expression were compared between SARS-CoV-2 and BCG-vaccinated experiments in KEGG mapper
(https://www.genome.jp/kegg/mapper.html).

PCA, Supplementary Figure 1C.
Differentially expressed genes screening
Of 23710 genes screened in the experiment, 7107 genes with constant values were removed. A total of 161 annotated genes
were identified to be differentially expressed, which included 113 upregulated DEGs and 48 downregulated genes
(Supplementary Figure 1D). The top variable genes between the SARS-CoV-2 and mock treated samples is shown in

and (f) PCNA-AS1, the antisense and regulator for Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen gene.
Of the down-regulated genes, (a) hes related family bHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif 2 (HEY2) is a nuclear
transcription factor that represses DNA and negatively regulates miR-146a, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α expression, (b) Protein
Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type Q (PTPRQ) phosphatase which catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine
and phosphatidylinositol and plays roles in cellular proliferation and differentiation and is required for auditory function,
and (c) Taste 1 Receptor Member 3 (TAS1R3) encoding for G-protein coupled receptor involved in taste responses. The

In order to analyze the aberrant gene expression pattern in SARS-CoV-2 infection, further functional analysis and
annotation for DEGs were performed (Figure 1C). Thirteen lncRNAs were deregulated following SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
Annotation analysis revealed that PPT2-EGFL8 readthrough (PPT2-EGFL8, FC=-3.5169|p=5.86E-06) was previously
associated with circulating phospho- and sphingolipid concentrations, some other were associated with gastric, breast, and
prostate cancer as INHBA-antisense RNA 1 (INHBA-AS1, FC=4.0|p=2.41E-07), RHPN1 antisense RNA 1 (RHPN1-AS1,
FC= 3.54|p=4.85E-06), and ST7 overlapping transcript 4 (ST7-OT, FC=4 -4.01|p=2.35E-07).
Genes for four miRNAs were deregulated; miR-936 (FC=3.88|p=5.4E-07), miR-23a (FC=3.32|p=1.8E-05), and miR-4257
(FC=2.79, p=3.1E-04) were upregulated, while miR-29b-2 was downregulated (FC=-3.4|p=1.12E-05). Four small nucleolar
RNA genes were upregulated; including two small nucleolar RNA, C/D box: SNORD42A (FC=4.95|p=1.69E-10) and
SNORD12B (FC=3.51|p=5.86E-06), and two small nucleolar RNA, H/ACA box: SNORA9 (FC=2.90|p=1.8E-04) and
SNORA71C (FC=2.63|p=6.8E-04). In addition, ten pseudogenes (6 upregulated and 4 downregulated DEGs) were identified
to be deregulated. Despite being non-functional DNA segments that resemble functional genes, some might contain
inherited or acquired promoter elements and exert beneficial regulatory function (www.GeneCards.org).
DEGs included 130 protein-coding genes (92 up and 38 down). Annotation of these genes revealed to enclose 7
transcription factors; three were activated; (a) TAL bHLH transcription factor 2 (TAL2), a basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factor (FC=3.74|p=4.7E-04), (b) dachshund family transcription factor 2 (DACH2), a winged helix/forkhead
transcription factor (FC=3.68|p=0.0006), and (c) AF4/FMR2 family member 2 (AFF2), a DNA-binding transcription factor
(FC=3.40|p=0.0023), and four were downregulated, (a) HEY2, basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (FC=5.24|p=3.44E-08), and three C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor, (b) Kruppel like factor 2 (KLF2, FC=-3.85|p=2.6E-04),
(c) early growth response 2 (EGR2, FC=-2.83|p=0.024), and (d) zinc finger and BTB domain containing 16 (ZBTB16, FC=2.74|p=0.0327). Furthermore, three genes for extracellular matrix structural protein were under-expressed; (a) IgGFcbinding protein (FCGBP, FD=-3.46, p=8.26E-06), (b) Collagen alpha-3(VI) chain (COL6A3, FC=-2.93|p=0.00015), and (c)
Complement component C1q receptor (CD93, FC=-2.74, p=0.0004). Additionally, phospholipid-transporting ATPase IM
(ATP8B4), an active transporter (FC=-2.88|p=0.0002) and Retroviral-like aspartic protease 1 (ASPRV1), a viral or
transposable element protein, (FC=-2.83|p=0.0002) were also downregulated. Two serine protease inhibitors were also
downregulated; Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 (IGFBP5, FC=-2.65|p=0.0006) and Serpin B10 (SERPINB10,
FC=-2.81|p=0.00028).
In contrast, multiple proteases were upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to mock-treated samples. Of these,
SENP3-EIF4A1 readthrough gene (SENP3-EIF4A1, FC=4.15|p=8.93E-08), Chymotrypsin-like protease (CTRL-1,
FC=2.88|p=0.00019), T-cell differentiation antigen CD6 (FC=2.88, p=0.00021), HTRA4 (FC=2.92, p=0.00016), ABHD1
(FC=2.83|p=0.0002), and Cytosolic carboxypeptidase 3 AGBL3 (FC=2.85|p=0.00024). Moreover, of the upregulated DEGs,
the active transporter, Aquaporin (AQP7, FC=3.07, p=0.0095), the gap junction protein gamma 2 (GJC2,
FC=3.32|p=1.87E-05), multiple membrane traffic proteins as MX dynamin like GTPase 1 (MX1, FC=2.71|p=0.0004) and
synaptotagmin 5 (SYT5, FC=2.88|p=0.0002), and ion channels as gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit rho2
(GABRR2, FC=2.74|p=0.0004) and bestrophin 4 (BEST4, FC=2.91|p=0.00017) (Supplementary Table S2).

To explore the functions of the DEGs, the 113 upregulated and 48 downregulated genes were subjected to GO and KEGG
pathway enrichment analysis. As shown in Figure 2A-C, the significantly enriched GO terms for upregulated genes were
mainly related to the acute inflammatory response (GO:0002526|FDR=6.46E-08), response to virus
(GO:0009615|FDR=7.27E-08), regulation of immune response (GO:0050776|FDR=2.23E-08 ), negative regulation of viral
genome replication (GO:0045071|FDR=1.60E-07), in addition to cytokine activity (GO:0005125|FDR=2.66E-09),
chemokine activity (GO:0008009|FDR=0.0018), chemotaxis (GO:0006935|FDR=5.07E-07), and response to stress
(GO:0006950|FDR=8.37E-14) (Supplementary Table S3). KEGG pathway analysis (Figure 2D) showed that upregulated
genes were mainly enriched in IL-17 signaling pathway (KEGG ID: hsa04657|FDR=1.39E-15), TNF signaling pathway
(hsa04668|FDR=5.34E-15), NOD-like receptor signaling pathway (hsa04621|FDR=4.07E-10), Cytokine-cytokine receptor
interaction (hsa04060|FDR=2.08E-07), Jak-STAT signaling pathway (hsa04630|FDR=5.38E-06), NF-κB signaling pathway
(hsa04064|FDR=1.33E-07), and Influenza A (hsa05164|FDR=1.10E-07). Other viral pathways included Kaposi's sarcomaassociated herpesvirus infection (hsa05167), Herpes simplex infection (hsa05168), Measles (hsa05162), Hepatitis C
(hsa05160), and Epstein-Barr virus infection (hsa05169) (Supplementary Table S4). In contrast, no significant GO terms
or pathways were significant for the downregulated genes.
As depicted in Figure 2D, upregulated pathways are highly connected with inflammatory cytokines exhibiting significant
crosstalk in particular. IL-6 (also known as B-stimulatory factor-2) is involved in the final differentiation of B cells into
immunoglobulin-secreting cells and the induction of acute-phase reactants. IL-6 has sequence similarity with granulocyte
colony-stimulating factors 2 and 3 (CSF2 and CSF3), which are also highly expressed following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Further, several interleukins (IL17C, IL19, IL36A, and IL36G) noted serve as proinflammatory cytokines for the regulation
of dendritic cells and T cells, as well as Interleukin-2 Receptor Subunit Gamma (IL2RG), which encodes a common gamma
chain essential for IL-receptor function. Overexpression of 2 members of the CC chemokine family were observed: C-C
Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2) and C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL20), which function to induce the migration
of monocytes and lymphocytes, respectively (www.GeneCards.org)
Gene regulatory networks
Gene-miRNA interactions network was constructed (Figure 2E). It consisted of 77 seeds (significant genes), 1136 nodes,
and 1776 edges mapped to the corresponding molecular interaction databases. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the
network was significant for four pathways; namely IL-17 signaling pathway (p=7E-05, Hits=5/93), TNF signaling pathway
(p=0.0017, Hits=4/110), cytokine-cytokine receptor pathway (p=0.012, Hits=5/294), and Influenza A (p=0.044,
Hits=3/167). After extraction of nodes relevant to these immune-related pathways, the densely connected microRNAs in
the cluster module included: miR-26b-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-124-3p, miR-7-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-335-5p, mirR-24-3p, miR203a-3p, and miR-122-5p.
Upstream regulatory cell signaling layers responsible for the observed pattern in gene expression following SARS-CoV-2
infection is depicted in Figure 2F-H. Network included integrated transcription factors and kinases with PPI. The top
enriched transcription factors were RELA proto-oncogene (p=1.55E-06), BCL3 (p=0.0014), TP63 (p=2.9E-05) and VDR
(p=0.0051). RELA, a NF-KB Subunit, has a key role in mediating inflammation, differentiation, cell growth, tumorigenesis
and apoptosis (www.GeneCards.org). It is associated with 12 overlapping targets in the DEGs list (IER3, STAT1, NFKB2,
ICAM1, DRAM1, NEDD9, IL32, NFKBIA, TNFAIP3, NFKBIZ, TNIP1). Another NF-kB regulator, BCL3, which has
paradox effect according to its subcellular localization; regulates transcriptional activation of NF-kappa-B target gene while

being in the nucleus and inhibits the nuclear translocation of the NF-kappa-B p50 subunit when existed in the cytoplasm
(www.GeneCards.org). From the DEGs defined following SARS-CoV-2 infection, six genes (IER3, STAT1, NFKB2,
NFKBIA, IRF9, and BIRC3) were targeted by BCL3. The nuclear receptor for calcitriol, VDR, was also significantly
associated with the up-regulated DEGs (NFKB2, NFKBIA, and IRAK2).
Tuberculosis pathway
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed over-representation of SARS-CoV-2 genes in Tuberculosis pathway (ID:
hsa05152, p=6.09E-04). In this particular pathway, 116 DEGS (of 179 genes) were upregulated (Supplementary Figure
S2). IL6, TLR9, and TNF were at the top of that list. VDR and CEPB are further noted for their critical regulation of
inflammatory and immune responses, including SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.

Transcriptomic changes following BCG vaccine administration
Differential expressed genes
After preprocessing of the expression data from the four different stages post vaccination (Supplementary Figure S3),
696, 66, 49, and 80 DEGs were detected at 14 days, 28 days, 56 days, and 84 days respectively. As depicted in Figure 3,
principal component analysis showed clustering with clear demarcation from the initial stage at day zero. A total of 696, 66,
49, and 80 DEGs respectively were identified (Figure 3D). The altered expression patterns across 4 different time points
showed host immune responses to be constantly changing post-BCG vaccination. Stratified analysis according to the
direction of DEGs showed similar results with no overlapping between up and down DEGs at each stage (Figure 3E-F).
Functional enrichment analysis
GO enrichment analysis was carried out in three categories, including biological processes (BP), molecular functions (MF),
and cellular components (CC). The most significant terms for BP, MF, and CC were the translation
(GO:0006412|FDR=8.59E-10), RNA binding (GO:0003723|FDR=6.98E-08), and Cytosolic ribosome
(GO:0022626|FDR=1.30E-08) at Day 14; short-chain fatty acid catabolic process (GO:0019626|FDR=0.0008), azole
transmembrane transporter activity (GO:1901474|FDR=0.0088), and nucleolar ribonuclease P complex
(GO:0005655|FDR=0.1409) at Day 28; protein import into peroxisome matrix (GO:0016558|FDR=0.0029), beta-1,3galactosyltransferase activity (GO:0048531|FDR=0.0046), and manchette (GO:0002177|FDR=0.0121) at Day 56; and
positive regulation of T-helper 2 cell differentiation (GO:0045630|FDR=0.0088), primary lysosome
(GO:0005766|FDR=0.0246), and alanine transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0022858|FDR=0.0121) at Day 84 post
vaccination.
Pathway enrichment analysis showed multiple activated pathways at different stages. The most significant upregulated
pathways at an early stage (Day 14 and Day 28 groups) were (a) Ribosome (hsa03010, FDR=3.83E-12) including multiple
mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (as MRPL17, MRPS21, RPL23A, MRPL24, MRPL34, MRPL36), and ribosomal proteins
for small subunits (RPS14, RPS15, RPS16, RPS19, RPS28), and large subunits (RPL18A, RPL36, RPLP2, RPL13, RPL15)
and (b) Propionyl-CoA catabolism (R-HSA-71032|FDR= 0.0001) via modulating methylmalonyl CoA epimerase (MCEE),
Methylmalonic aciduria type A (MMAA), and propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCCB) genes. However, at later stages, the top

upregulated pathways were Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (hsa00970|FDR=0.0246), Scavenging of heme from plasma (RHSA-2168880|FDR=0.0056), and Heme Biosynthesis (WP561|FDR=0.020).
In contrast, of the inhibited pathways after 2-weeks of vaccination were Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction
(hsa04060|FDR=2.63E-04), JAK-STAT signaling pathway (hsa04630|FDR=0.047), and ECM-receptor interaction
(hsa04512|FDR=0.05456). Cell adhesion molecules (hsa04514|FDR=0.0055) and Cytokines and Inflammatory Response
(WP530|FDR=0.137) were downregulated in the same cohorts one month after vaccination. However, delayed host immune
response at Day 56 showed downregulation of NOD-like receptor signaling pathway (hsa04621|FDR=0.0029), PI3K-Akt
signaling pathway (hsa04151|FDR=0.0057), and Signaling by Interleukins (R-HSA-449147|FDR=0.0048), while inhibited
Interferon Signaling (R-HSA-913531|FDR=0.0014) and Interferon alpha/beta signaling (R-HSA-909733|FDR=0.0015)
were inactivated in patients at Day 84 post vaccination. Activated and inhibited GO and pathway terms for each stage are
listed in detail in Supplementary Tables S5-S12.
Protein-protein interaction network
On comparing combined post-vaccination samples (days 14, 28, 56, and 84) versus day 0, 76 DEGs (41 up and 35 down)
were defined. Protein-protein interaction network was constructed from the combined DEGs. The clusters with densely
connected nodes in the PPI network were detected (Figure 3G). KEGG enrichment analysis revealed 121 significant
downregulated pathways. Eleven pathways were extracted in a separate subnetwork module; namely Influenza A, IL-17
signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Chemokine signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, PI3KAkt signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, Gap junction,
and Leukocyte transendothelial migration (Figure 3H-I). The number of nodes was 2076, while corresponding edges
counted for 6123. To identify hub genes involved in the host immune response following BCG vaccination, further gene set
enrichment analysis of the cluster was performed. Downregulated genes with high strength of enrichment as NFKB1
(Degree of connectivity with other genes=91), RELA (Degree=95), IKBKB (Degree=60) genes were enriched in 8 (out of
11) pathways, followed by PIK3CA (Degree=119), PIK3CD (Degree=59), PRKCB (Degree=26), RAF1 (Degree=69), AKT1
(Degree=221) and AKT2 (Degree=48) were involved in 6 (out of 11) pathways.

Comparison between transcriptomic signature in SARS-CoV-2 infection and BCG vaccination
Intersecting common pathways
A total of 52 enriched KEGG pathways were upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cross-reference of these upregulated
pathways with downregulated KEGG pathways in BCG vaccination experiment, 45 common pathways were intersected
accounting for 86.5% of SARS-CoV-2 upregulated pathways (Figure 4A-C). These pathways were categorized into the
following groups: (1) cellular processes, (2) organismal systems, (3) environmental information, and (4) human diseases.
The top significant ones in SARS-CoV-2 experiment were IL-17 signaling pathway (FDR=1.39E-15|Hits=14/92;
overlapping genes in the pathway compared to the total gene set in the pathway), TNF signaling pathway (FDR=5.34E15|Hits=14/108 genes), NOD-like receptor signaling pathway (FDR=4.07E-10|Hits=12/166 genes). Other immune-related
pathways were Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (FDR=2.08E-07|Hits=11/263 genes), NF-κB signaling pathway
(FDR=1.33E-07|Hits=8/93 genes), and JAK-STAT signaling pathway (FDR=5.38E-06|Hits=8/160 genes). In the same 45
pathways, viral infectious agents included Influenza A (FDR=1.10E-07|Hits=10/168 genes), Measles (FDR=1.33E9|P a g e

07|Hits=9/133 genes), Herpes simplex virus 1 infection (FDR=1.33E-07|Hits=10/181 genes) and bacterial infections
included Legionellosis (FDR=0.0014|Hits=7/54 genes) and Tuberculosis (FDR=0.0039|Hits=5/172 genes). Overlapping
genes within each pathway that were significantly upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection and downregulated following
BCG vaccination at the four different time points (14, 28, 56, and 84 days), and are demonstrated in Supplementary Table
S13. Although different genes were modified at each time point, the pathways remained constantly downregulated postBCG vaccination.
Comparative enrichment analysis in Tuberculosis pathway
On comparing 116 DEGs in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells which were over-represented in the 179 gene set of Tuberculosis
pathways with their expression pattern after BCG vaccination, the top upregulated inflammatory markers; including
IL6/IL12, TLR1/2/9, TNF, C3, IL1A/B, NFKB1, TGFB2, AKT1, and HLA-DPA1/B1, and transcription factors as NFKB1 and
STAT1 showed reversed direction post-vaccination. Additionally, the down-regulated DEGs in SARS-CoV-2, including
several non-receptor serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT3, CAMK2D, and MAPK10), the monocyte differentiation antigen
(CD14), the membrane trafficking regulatory protein (LAMP2), growth factor (TGFB3), the apoptotic regulator (BCL2),
and proinflammatory cytokines (IL18) switched their direction following BCG vaccine administration (Figure 4D). Similar
paradox directions of expression level in some DEGs for SARS-CoV-2 cells and BCG vaccine samples were also noted in
Supplementary Figure S4-S10.

DISCUSSION
Overview
To gain insight into the engendering mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the gene expression profiles of the virus
were systematically analyzed through bioinformatic techniques. In this study, a total of 161 DEGs, including 113
upregulated and 48 downregulated, were screened. The biological functions of these DEGs were explored based on GO
function and pathway enrichment data. Further analysis indicated significant upregulation in 45 distinct KEGG pathways in
SARS-CoV-2 infection overlapped with pathways down-regulated following the BCG vaccination. In addition to the
pathway analysis, this study describes potential kinases, transcription factors, miRNAs, and lncRNAs differentially
expressed in Sars-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2 and 5). Several candidate DEGs, including IL-6, CCL20, CSF2, ICAM, and
CXCL1/2 were highlighted for their key roles in respiratory viral infection, tuberculosis, and overall immune function. To
elucidate the relationship between COVID-19 infection and BCG-vaccination, the common pathways were categorized into
the following groups: inflammatory and immunoregulatory, signaling, and infectious pathways.
Common Inflammatory and Immunoregulatory Pathways
Of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, analysis implicates several upregulated genes enriched in inflammatory pathways, most
significantly in the IL-17 and NOD-like receptor pathways. Conversely, these same pathways were downregulated in the
BCG-vaccinated group, suggesting BCG vaccination may compensate for aspects of pathway dysregulation in SARS-CoV2 infection. The family of IL-17 mediates protective innate immunity against external pathogens and plays a central role in
the self-clearance of intracellular pathogens37,38. Additionally, T helper cells (Th17), which themselves produce Il-17, are
known to be key players in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases and autoimmune tissue destruction39.

Elevated Th17 responses and IL-17 pathways are seen in COVID-19 patients and have been linked to ‘cytokine storms’, a
surge of pro-inflammatory molecules that are associated with the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) typically
seen in these patients40. BCG vaccination has been shown to confer protective immunity in the Rhesus macaque model by
decreasing Th17 cell maturation, thus suppressing Th17 response and preventing production of IL-1723,41. Further, IL-17A
and IL-17F induce proinflammatory gene expression of NF-𝜅𝜅B, MAPK, in synergy with TNF-𝛼𝛼 and IL-6. IL-17 gene
family also eliminates self-reactive T cells through production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and
several chemokines upregulated in Sars-CoV-2 infected cells, including CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL20 and IL-1739,42 (Figure 9).
The other major upregulated inflammatory pathway, NOD-Like receptor signaling pathway, detects various pathogens and
stimulates innate immune responses against them, driving the subsequent activation of cytokine, NF-𝜅𝜅B, and MAPK
pathways. Upregulation of NOD-like receptor signaling without appropriate negative feedback regulation can contribute to
pathological tissue damage43. Innate and adaptive immune response to an invading pathogen relies on the ability of the
body to recognize foreign elements and is stimulated by inflammasomes, which are intracellular multi-protein complexes
such as NOD-like receptors (NLR)44. NLRC5 (short for NOD-like receptor family CARD domain containing 5) regulates
major histocompatibility complex class I expression in the course of an infection. In accordance with this, a study reported
knockdown of NLRC5 resulted in decreased levels of CD8+ cells in influenza A virus45. Our study identifies significant
upregulation of IL-17 and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways in the immune response of COVID-19, pathways that
were markedly downregulated in BCG-vaccination.
Common Signal Transduction Pathways
Similarly, several signal transduction pathways were up-regulated in Sars-CoV-2 and inversely downregulated in the BCGvaccinated group with TNF, NF-κB, MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways conferring the most statistical significance.
TNF signaling upregulation is heavily involved in the complex regulation of immune cells. Following trimerization with
either TNFR1 (expressed nearly ubiquitously) or TNFR2 (expressed mostly in immune cells), the TNF signaling pathway
can activate NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways downstream of it. Upon viral infection, NF-κB proteins regulate the
transcription of many genes, including antimicrobial peptides, cytokines, chemokines, stress-response proteins and antiapoptotic proteins46. In a study of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), a viral infection caused by a member of
the coronavirus family, researchers found the virus downregulated antiviral cytokines (TNF-alpha) as it induced proinflammatory cytokines (Il-1 beta, Il-6, Il-8) during initial infection47. In a study of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS), yet another member of the coronavirus family, TNF-alpha was similarly downregulated and induced NF-κB
activation46. In the SARS pathogen, ACE2 was determined to be the functional receptor of the virus through the regulation
of TNF-alpha, which ultimately permitted viral entry and promoted respiratory pathogenesis. Altogether, the literature on
other members of the coronavirus family indicates a disruption of TNF-signaling pathway, which is in accordance with the
marked pathway upregulation of TNF pathways signaling noted in our findings. In BCG vaccinated models in vitro,
exposure of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to BCG treatment boosted IL-6 and TNF-α expression in
response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation22. Similarly, BCG-immunized adults produced high TNF-α and IL-1β
expression 3-month post-vaccination23. In addition to sustained cytokine response at 3 months, the production of
heterologous Th1 and Th17 remained elevated 1-year post-BCG vaccination, concluding the vaccine created long-term
immune responses to pathogens besides M.tb alone23.

Downstream of TNF, the NF-κB signaling pathway similarly affects a broad range of biological processes, including
adaptive immune, inflammatory, and stress responses. Upon viral infection, NF-κB proteins regulate the transcription of
many genes, including antimicrobial peptides, cytokines, chemokines, stress-response proteins and anti-apoptotic
proteins46. Of the COVID-19 upregulated genes involved in the NF-κB pathway were CSF-2 and IL-6, transcription factors
and innate immune system mediators55,56. The upregulation of CSF-2, produced by endothelial and immune cells, is
similarly upregulated in other respiratory diseases, including mycoplasma pneumoniae and M.tb, by promoting neutrophil
and macrophage inflammatory response. The upregulation of IL-6 has been noted in other members of the coronavirus
family, including the pathogenic agent responsible for SARS. In murine models, SARS-coronavirus spike protein, which is
evolutionarily conserved in Sars-CoV-2, induced upregulation of IL-6 through the NF-κB pathway. Higher levels of
proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF, CSF-2, IL-1b, and IL-8 are noted in COVID-19 patients with increasing
levels as a predictor of the severity of pneumonia57.
Additionally, MAPK signaling was upregulated in the Sars-CoV-2 infected group while inversely downregulated in the
BCG-vaccinated group. MAPK regulates cellular processes of proliferation, stress responses, as well as immune
defense44,48,49. MAPK signaling cascade is activated in response to external stress signals of the 3 MAP kinases (ERK, JNK,
and p38 isoforms) with the subsequent stimulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines by JNK and p38 signaling50-52. In the
nucleus, activated JNK and p38 promote multiple effector proteins, including NF-κB, c-Jun, STAT153. These effector
proteins have been implicated in viral infections such as influenza A and HSV-1 and their dysregulation by pathogens is
associated with impaired antiviral response by the host53,54. The downregulation of the MAPK pathway in the BCGvaccinated group (Figure 10) may be able to partially reverse the upregulation induced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Additionally, our results indicated the top 3 upregulated kinases in SARS-CoV-2 group were MAKP14, MAPK3, and
MAPK1, further corroborating the central role MAPK plays in viral pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 6).
JAK-STAT signaling, which is a major pathway involved in cytokine signaling and subsequent inflammation, was
upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection as well. IFNs induce the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which in turn activates
transcription of widespread immune protection. For this reason, several viruses have evolved to target the JAK/STAT
pathway themselves58. Several studies have recently advocated for the potential benefit of commercially available Jak 1 and
2 inhibitors as anti-inflammatory treatment in COVID-19 cases58; however, there is concern from the scientific community
that JAK inhibitors may promote the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus as this has been reported in herpes viruses. BCG
vaccination may be key in attenuating the JAK/STAT pathway without entirely impairing interferon-mediated response. In
vitro experiments show that BCG vaccination induces 2 members of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family,
SOCS1/3, eliciting a negative feedback regulator of the JAK/STAT signaling cascade via IFN-gamma regulation59.
Overall, although TNF, NF-κB, MAPK, and JAK/STAT signaling were upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were
markedly downregulated in BCG, suggesting BCG vaccination may be targeting these same pathways. The exact
mechanism remains elusive, but identification of these pathways and their targets are key to mitigating pathogenesis and
merit further investigation.
Infectious and Human Disease Signaling Pathways
Further, in the current study, BCG vaccination down regulated several pathways related to viral and bacterial inflammatory
disease pathways including influenza A, measles, Herpes simplex virus 1, Legionellosis, and tuberculosis, that were up12|P a g e

regulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Prior studies have demonstrated non-specific effects of BCG against viral infection21,
and bacterial infections32, 60. In one study, mice inoculated with BCG displayed overall increased resistance to
encephalomyocarditis, murine hepatitis, type 1 and 2 herpes simplex, foot-and-mouth disease and A0 and A2 influenza
viruses61. Intercellular adhesion molecules (or CD54), included in the upregulated DEGs, are receptors utilized for
pathogen entry into host cells that promote intercellular signaling and survival of virus in the host cell. In human rhinovirus
infection and influenza virus, ICAM-1 is involved in viral protein uncoating, delivering the viral RNA genome into the
cytoplasm of host cells across a lipid bilayer62,63. Other studies corroborate this showing that most viruses interact with and
induce ICAM-1 expression, including HIV, Human Parainfluenza virus, and rhinovirus infection64-66. Presence of cytokines
such as IFN-γ, TGF-beta, and TNF- α induces expression of ICAM on macrophage for activation of T cells, this was
observed in human TB infected macrophages67. BCG immunotherapy of bladder tumors cells showed mycobacteria
infection-induced expression of ICAM-1 molecules, thereby eliciting immune response through improved antigen
presentation to T lymphocytes68. BCG is thought to inhibit inflammasome activation via Zinc metalloproteases in order to
improve immunogenicity60,69 and remains the current standard therapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.
The Role of VDR and Other Enriched Transcription Factors
Compared to mock-treated cells, SARS-CoV-2 infected cells exhibited significant enrichment of VDR transcription factor,
one of the major downstream signaling transduction nuclear receptor in tuberculosis KEGG pathway, and was significantly
associated with the up-regulated DEGs, namely NFKB2, NFKBIA, and IRAK2, which are related to NF-κB and Toll-like
receptor signaling pathways. Normally, VDR binds to calcitriol, the active form of Vitamin D. The VDR-calcitriol complex
interacts with retinoid-X-receptor to form a heterodimer capable of regulating transcriptional activity, leading to several
pleiotropic transcriptional effects. Similarly, VDR gene expression was continuously upregulated during HIV70 and
influenza virus infection71. Previously reported, VDR signaling may repress cytokine gene expression in activated T-cells,
consequently reducing inflammatory response28,72. Part of the mechanism of action of BCG vaccine against tuberculosis is
through increased production of Vitamin D, which binds with its nuclear receptor VDR, resulting in the generation of
antimicrobial peptides (cathelicidin and beta-defensin) and death of intracellular M.tb44. In short, Vitamin D plays an
important role in modulating the innate and adaptive immune response alongside its classically characterized role in bone
health. Long before the scientific basis was understood, Vitamin D was unknowingly and empirically being used to help
tuberculosis patients who were sent to sanatoriums for sun-light exposure and prescribed cod-liver - remedies rich in
Vitamin D73. Since then, Vitamin D has been well characterized for its immuno-modulatory properties, including the
regulation of IFN-gamma, a key activator of macrophage response74 and promoting the production of regulatory T cells75.
In addition to its role in M.tb76, cathelicidin is a highly conserved protein that has been shown to direct antiviral activity in
several respiratory viral infections including respiratory syncytial virus, human Rhinovirus (HRV), and influenza A77-82. In
vitro, Vitamin D has been shown to counteract the M.tb-induced downregulation of cathelicidin by actually recovering
cathelicidin levels and promoting Th1 cell differentiation. Following BCG vaccination, Vitamin D levels remain elevated,
indicating Vitamin D is being upregulated long after the initial inoculation. It has been postulated that increased calcitriol
recruits dendritic cells from the site of inoculation to the lymph nodes, accounting for the sustained response24. This serves
as a possible mechanism of protective effects of BCG vaccination in relation to consistently elevated plasma Vitamin D
concentration present for as long as 9 months as reported by the authors24. A major complication of COVID-19 infection is
inflammation of the air sacs of the lungs resulting in pneumonia. Vitamin D deficiency contributed to the pathogenesis of

acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)83. Biotransformation into the active form of vitamin D-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D (calcitriol) by the 1-α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) enzyme found in liver cells, and immune cells expression of VDR,
confirms major role of Vitamin D in immune regulation; both in innate and adaptive immune responses25-28,72.. Mutation in
the VDR gene single nucleotide polymorphism reported in children was associated with response to viral infection in
children82. Given these findings, the transcriptional upregulation of VDR in SARS-CoV-9 may be contributing to the
dysregulation of this response by upregulating cytokine response, interrupting microbial peptides, and promoting immune
invasion in the lungs; therefore, the well characterized role of VDR in BCG vaccination could serve as a potential
biomarker against COVID-19 disease.
In addition to VDR, our bioinformatic analysis showed deregulation of multiple transcription factors in SARS-CoV-2
infection. Specifically, TAL2, DACH2, and AFF2 were upregulated whose functional role in viral immune response is
unclear, while HEY2, KLF2, EGR2, and ZBTB16 were under-expressed and were previously reported to have eminent role
in fine-tuning immune response. HEY2 was the most downregulated gene in our list. It is a known transcription repressor,
modulating cardiovascular development, neurogenesis, and oncogenesis84. A recent study demonstrated the role of HEY2 in
inflammation, namely chronic periodontitis, via negative regulation of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α expressions85. KLF2 is a key
player in T cell differentiation, trafficking, quiescence, and survival, in addition to the regulation of endothelial function.
Mice with KLF2 deficiency experienced an activated T cell phenotype with severely reduced T cells in the periphery and
increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection86,87. EGR2 transcription factor can control adaptive innate immunity and lead to
functional impairment of T cells88. After infection with influenza virus, EGR2 knockout mice exhibited prolonged viral
shedding, impaired CD4 + T-cell response, infiltration of memory precursor type CD8 + T cells into the lung with
decreased IFN-γ, TNFα, and granzyme B89. ZBTB16 transcription factor can mediate the ubiquitination and subsequent
proteasomal degradation of target proteins90. Transcription factor enrichment analysis unravels multiple transcription
factors modulating the deregulated genes in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. RELA, a well-known antiviral transcription factor,
was the top enriched transcription factor for DEGs following SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is previously reported to promote
the growth of cytopathic RNA viruses by extending the lifespan of infected cells and serve as the replicative niche of
intracellular pathogens91. TP63 was also shown to be a cellular regulator of the HPV life cycle92.
MicroRNAs, small nucleolar RNAs and pseudogenes
In the present study, we observed some deregulated miRNAs and highlighted the relationship between DEGs and miRNAs
networking which may account for the transcriptomic changes evident in SARS-CoV-2 expression. Of particular note, mir26a-5p, miR-26b-5p, and miR-124-3p, which have all been well characterized for their involvement in viral and bacterial
inflammatory pathways, particularly Influenza A, RSV, and M.tb, were noted here for their putative respiratory
pathogenesis. In M.tb infection, miR-26a-5p can modulate macrophage IFN-gamma responsiveness3. In another study, this
same microRNA was shown to be downregulated in Influenza A virus in humans, contributing to viral pathogenesis4. The
other family member, miR-26b-5p, can inhibit viral replication in Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Sendai virus (SeV)
by inducing type-1 IFN expression5. RSV acts to upregulate miR-26b, which in turn inhibits Toll-like receptor TLR4, a key
sentinel in adaptive immune response 6. A similar effect on TLRs is seen in the pathogenesis of M.tb in alveolar
macrophages wherein microRNA-124 negatively regulates TLR signaling. SARS-CoV-2 infected cells exhibited
overexpression of miR-23a, which was previously shown to promote the replication of human herpes simplex virus type 1
via downregulating interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), an innate antiviral molecule97. Altogether, the highlighted cluster

of microRNAs are likely regulating viral pathways relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Post-transcriptional regulation of
some genes altered in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells are therefore worthy of experimental validation.
Small nucleolar RNAs and pseudogenes were found to be deregulated in SARS-CoV-2 cells. SnoRNAs can serve as a
source of short regulatory RNA species involved in the control of processing and translation of various mRNAs. Despite
their exact role in COVID-19 and tuberculosis is unclear and complicated, these ncRNAs were found to be upregulated in
virus-infected human cells. They can guide chemical modifications of structural RNAs and have a role in cell-cell
communication98. SnoRNAs were reported to have a paradox effect; they can act as mediators of host antiviral response,
and on the other hand, are utilized by viruses to evade innate immunity and complete their life cycle98. Furthermore,
different groups of pseudogenes were activated in human cells upon triggering inflammation with known cellular protein,
including virus particles and chunks of bacterial cell walls, highlighting the unique functions of pseudogenes in host
immune response99.
Limitations
To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to dig into the regulatory mechanisms underlying the host immune
response against SARS-CoV-2infection and to provide a putative protective role of BCG vaccination. Altogether, several
DEGs with a high connectivity degree in the PPI network were identified in this study, which showed the strong inverse
correlation in SARS-CoV-2 infection and BCG vaccination with upregulation in the former and downregulation in the
latter. This inverse relationship suggests BCG vaccination may mediate key pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infection through
NSEs. Nevertheless, it is essential to recognize some limitations of administering BCG vaccines, including, the
heterogeneity of BCG response due to pharmacogenomic variation of patients, contraindications of BCG-vaccination for
immunosuppressed patients, and the presence of different strains of BCG vaccines in the market100. Although the exact
mechanisms with which BCG elicits protective effects are not entirely understood, its efficacy in infectious, oncogenic, and
inflammatory disease are well documented and may confer similar effects if COVID-19.
Conclusion
In summary, bioinformatic approach identified key differentially expressed genes involved in the pathogenesis of COVID19. Significant nodes in the PPI network, including high degrees in IL-17 signaling, TNF signaling pathway, NOD-like
receptor, and NF-κB give novel insight into the inflammatory and signal transduction pathways mediating SARS-CoV-2
viral infection. The 45 common pathways upregulated in SARS-CoV-19 and downregulated in BCG vaccination suggest
BCG vaccination may help to mitigate this pathway dysregulation. Although further experimental validation is warranted to
verify our discoveries, the results give insight into potential biomarkers and targeted therapy to address the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic. We sustain BCG vaccination may be a safe and cost-effective alternative in incurring partial
protection against COVID-19 pandemic until more targeted measures can be produced and implemented.

downregulated (blue) DEGs. (B) Gene set enrichment analysis showing the top 100 variable genes between the six samples.
(C) The numbers of the upregulated and downregulated differentially expressed genes. Relative expression level of DEGs
stratified by the type of genes.
Fig. 2. Functional enrichment analysis and gene regulatory networks. (A) Gene ontology analysis for molecular
function, (B) for biological processes, (C) for cellular components, (D) KEGG Pathway enrichment analysis. Nodes
represented pathways, with color based on its significance. Four enlarged highlighted nodes represented the most
significant pathways. Bipartite gene networks with these nodes showed the association with upregulated (red) and
downregulated (green) genes. (E) Gene-microRNAs interaction. Data source for interaction pairs: TarBase and
miRTarBase. Red and green circles represented upregulated and downregulated DEGs respectively. Blue squares
represented the microRNAs. Full network is shown with extracted nodes (ellipse) for four significant KEGG pathways. (F)
Transcription Factor Enrichment Analysis (TFEA) showing putative transcription factors that most likely to regulate the
differences in gene expression. (G) Upstream regulatory network that connects the enriched transcription factors to kinases
through known protein-protein interactions. (H) Kinase Enrichment Analysis (KEA). Candidate enriched protein kinases
that most likely regulate the formation of the identified transcriptional complexes. They are ranked based on overlap
between known kinase–substrate phosphorylation interactions and the proteins in the protein-protein interaction subnetwork
created in Figure 2G.
