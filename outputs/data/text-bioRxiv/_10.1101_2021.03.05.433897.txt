Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic poses a huge problem of public health that requires the implementation
of all available means to contrast it, and drugs are one of them. In this context, we observed an
unmet need of depicting the continuously evolving scenario of the ongoing drug clinical trials
through an easy-to-use, freely accessible online tool. Starting from this consideration, we developed
COVIDrugNet (http://compmedchem.unibo.it/covidrugnet), a web application that allows users to
capture a holistic view and keep up to date on how the clinical drug research is responding to the
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Here, we describe the web app and show through some examples how one can explore the whole
landscape of medicines in clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19 and try to probe the
consistency of the current approaches with the available biological and pharmacological evidence.
We conclude that careful analyses of the COVID-19 drug-target system based on COVIDrugNet
can help to understand the biological implications of the proposed drug options, and eventually
improve the search for more effective therapies.

Introduction
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of 2020 has
shocked the population worldwide. One year later, (February 2021) about 110 million confirmed
cases of COVID-19 have been reported by WHO included more than 2.4 million deaths
(https://covid19.who.int/). As expected, in such a mankind threatening situation, the scientific
community put in place a great effort to help countering the spread of the virus, as evidenced among
the other things by the huge number of papers dealing with various aspects of the disease appeared
in the literature. For instance, the LitCovid literature hub1 has collected more than 100,000 articles
(February 18, 2021 access) covering arguments categorized as overview, disease mechanism,
transmission dynamics, treatment, case report and epidemic forecasting.
As regards the COVID-19 treatment, the race to the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 started
immediately after the isolation of the viral genome2 and gave the first results as soon as December
2020. Moreover, despite the exploration of different approaches like, e.g., the infusion of plasma
from human survivors3, the pharmacological option, namely small molecule drugs and antibodies, is
being actively pursued. However, the route to a new drug is long and costly, and the classical drug
discovery pipeline is not compatible with the needs of rapid intervention on a population of millions
of patients. At the moment, a viable alternative seems to be the repurposing of known drugs4, i.e.,
the use for the treatment of COVID-19 of drugs currently on the market for different therapeutic
purposes.
Known drugs that are currently in clinical or pre-clinical study for the treatment of COVID-19 are
aimed either at inhibiting viral or human targets involved in some of the processes of viral entry and
replication, or at treating inflammation and tissue injury consequent to the viral infection5,6. Even
though it might seem that a direct antiviral approach could lead to a straightforward solution, only
few of the existing antivirals have performed well in the clinic so far. On the other hand, a number
of drugs used for the most disparate therapeutic indications and entered into clinical trials even with

an uncertain rationale7 are showing preliminary promising results. However, as it has been
observed8, a real "repurposing tsunami" has invested the biomedical community, so much so that
today it is difficult not only to keep track of the results of the trials, but also to follow the new
proposals.
With the aim of helping researchers navigate the sea of outcomes and reports coming from the
studies on COVID-19, some institutions and companies have developed online platforms that
collect and organize both literature and data, eventually providing free access to the latter. For
example, the already mentioned LitCovid hub1
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/) is a daily updated source of relevant
articles retrieved from PubMed. Other platforms dealing with data on drugs and chemicals, like,
e.g., CHEMBL9 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/), PubChem10
(https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), or DrugBank11 (https://www.drugbank.ca/), have
introduced special sections dedicated to COVID-19-related information. In addition, more
specialized resources have appeared on the web to help accessing and analyzing COVID-19 data,
mainly in the fields of epidemiology, genomics, interactomics, and, to a lesser extent,
pharmacology. In this class of web tools, it is worth mentioning CORDITE (CORona Drug
InTEractions database)12, a web interface that provides a database of potential drugs, targets,
interactions, and relative publications obtained from a manually curated selection of literature
sources. With the same purpose of facilitating the data analysis, the COVID-19 Drug and Gene Set
Library was built as an online collection of COVID-19 related drugs and genes13. A comprehensive
critical review on this kind of web tools has recently been published by Mercatelli et al.14.
Considering the great amount of valuable scientific information that has already been produced and
published, and that will be presumably produced for some time more on COVID-19 related topics,
it could be useful to look at the whole scenario of results, to foster the acquisition of that knowledge
that can only emerge from consideration of both the totality and the complexity of data. In other

words, and limiting ourselves to the pharmacological treatment issue, one might think of presenting
and analyzing the information on proposed drugs in a way that takes into account not only the
different types of data (chemical, biological, genomic, etc.), but also the relationships among them,
that is on a network basis. The context is that of network medicine15. An attempt in this direction
has recently been proposed by Korn et al.16, who developed a knowledgebase and an online
platform (COVID-KOP) to integrate the existing biomedical information with the newly acquired
knowledge on COVID-19. By means of this web tool, one can easily produce an aggregate graph
connecting, e.g., COVID-19 phenotypic features to a drug studied for treating the disease, through
the genes known to be linked to both. Still in the context of network medicine, CoVex is another
platform that offers the user the possibility to explore the SARS-CoV-2 virus-host-drug interactome
for drug repurposing aims17. In addition, we want to mention CovMulNet1918 that at present looks
like the most thorough network-based tool allowing to integrate the available genotypic and
phenotypic information on COVID-19, like, SARS-CoV-2 proteins, their human partners, as well as
symptoms, diseases, and drugs. Finally, Coronavirus canSAR19 is a freely available resource that
offers druggable interactomes of SARS-Cov-2 proteins and human proteins, as well as reports about
3D structures, drugs, and clinical trials.
In a specifically drug-focused context, the network medicine approach assumes the overcoming of
the old “one drug, one target, one disease” concept in favor of a more outright “multi-drug, multitarget, multi-disease” approach20. The exploration of a such complex system of interactions can be
aided by the construction of a drug-target network21. In reference to the COVID-19 case, drugtarget networks have been previously built and examined22–24 especially with the aim of repurposing
already approved drugs.
Here, we present the COVID-19 Drugs Networker (COVIDrugNet:
http://compmedchem.unibo.it/covidrugnet), a web application that offers a different point of view
on anti-COVID-19 drugs by allowing a network-based analysis of the DrugBank dataset of

potential repurposed drugs currently in clinical trial. The freely accessible application automatically
retrieves the data from DrugBank, builds the drug-target network, and allows the user to carry out
some basic network analysis. Moreover, we show how, using COVIDrugNet, some peculiar aspects
of the proposed pharmacological options against COVID-19, in terms of substances, targets, and
their interrelationships can be revealed. Although what is reported here is an instant analysis based
on current data, the continuous updating of COVIDrugNet will allow us to follow the future
development of the drugs proposed for the treatment of the disease, thus providing an always
updated view of the COVID-19 system pharmacology.

Results and Discussion
COVID-19 Drugs Networker
The COVID-19 Drug Networker (COVIDrugNet, Figure 1) is a web tool designed for the
exploration of the landscape of the drugs currently in clinical trials to combat the SARS-CoV-2
infection. The web app is based on a network approach that supports both visualization and analysis
of the complex scenario of repurposed drugs for the COVID-19 and related conditions. The core of
the web tool are the interactive networks and the additional features that allow one to explore drug
and target data, as well as network properties. The main network is a bipartite Drug-Target network
(DT, Figure 2a), in which the nodes are drugs and targets, and are connected if a relation between
them is reported in DrugBank. Since bipartite networks are usually investigated by compressing
their information into two monopartite networks called projections25, COVIDrugNet provides two
of such networks only having drugs or targets as nodes: in the following, we refer to them as Drug
and Target projections, (DP and TP, respectively; Figures 2b and 2c).
As regards the user interface, it is basically divided into the main and the Advanced Tools blocks.
The first one allows users to immediately access the main body of information, capturing the
holistic view of the current drug repurposing status for COVID-19. However, a more in-depth

examination of the data is possible, by taking advantage of some more specialized graph analysis
tools provided in Advanced Tools.
In detail, the main block includes the graph, and the Charts and Plots and Graph Properties
sections (Figure 1). As mentioned before, the heart of each web page is the interactive graph with
its related information box (Node Info) that provides a summary documentation of single
drug/target nodes hovered over or individually selected. The box contains links to some databases
providing the available information related to individual properties of both drugs and targets. In
addition, a multiple node selection brings up the Inspected Data hidden section that displays
detailed information of the selected nodes in a tabular format. By the way, networks and tables can
be downloaded in different formats to allow an external analysis of the data.
Node coloring options are provided, useful to visualize some node attributes related to therapeutic,
biological, or network-based features. For instance, the user can decide to color the nodes according
to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code in the DP, or protein family, protein class or
cellular location in the TP. Moreover, in the drug-target network and in both projections, it is
possible to color the nodes based on some network attributes - i.e., degree, centrality measures or
node grouping - considering the entire graph or the major component. To examine all these
properties at a glance, the web tool also provides the Chart and Plot section, in which the pie charts
- or bar chart in the case of the ATC code coloring option - are updated accordingly to the node
coloring option to show the relative proportions between the values of that property. In this area of
the projection web pages, the web tool also provides the plot of the nodes’ degree distribution.
Among the graph interactive features, the Highlight a node dropdown menu is useful to find nodes
by name, and the button HIGHLIGHT BY PROPERTY allows a customized filtering on node
properties to highlight and/or download a specific node selection. In the Graph Properties section,
some centrality measures useful to analyze the network topology are displayed in a downloadable
table. A short explanation of each computed property is provided in a Glossary in the Help page.

Regarding the Advanced Tools block, it contains three sections: Clustering, Advanced Degree
Distribution and Current Virus-Host-Drug Interactome. The Clustering section is dedicated to the
node grouping analysis carried out through different methods (see Nodes Grouping section in
Methods). In particular, we thought it could be of interest to examine the grouping of the nodes in
the projection graphs, as, e.g., in perspective it might reveal possible trends in the selection of drugs
to be repurposed or privileged areas of intervention in the biology of the infected cells. To this aim,
the web app allows for three different techniques of investigation of the networks
partitioning: spectral analysis combined with K-means clustering26, Girvan-Newman27 and greedy
modularity community detection28 methods. The plot in this Clustering section reports either the
eigenvalues distribution used in the application of the spectral clustering method, or the modularity
trend in the Girvan-Newman community detection method. Both plots are interactive and allow the
user to choose the level (number) of grouping.
The Advanced Degree Distribution section presents an interactive chart of the degree distribution
and some of its possible distribution fittings compared to those of an Erdős-Rényi equivalent graph
(see Degree Distribution Fitting section in Methods).
Finally, the Current Virus-Host-Drug Interactome section displays a bipartite network built on the
basis of experimental studies and checked for protein targets present in the DT network (see below
for details).

Graphs Analysis
In Figure 2, the graphs representing the networks generated by COVIDrugNet are displayed. The
DT network is a disconnected network with a large connected component accounting for 83.2% of
nodes (1212 out of 1457). This structure reminds that of the general drug-target network reported
elsewhere21, where most drugs have more than one target and several drugs can share the same
target(s). However, from inspection of the graph, it immediately appears that there are two drug
nodes that heavily affect the network topology by showing an exceedingly high degree compared to

all other nodes: Fostamatinib and Artenimol, having 305 and 186 direct neighbors, respectively. For
both drugs, this reflects a number of reported targets that is considerably higher than the
average (<7), being 6.9 and 4.2 times higher, respectively, than that of Cannabidiol that, with 44
targets, is the third in rank for the highest number of neighbors in the DT network. Indeed, these
two drugs show a peculiar behavior strongly affecting the network structure not only in the DT, but
consequently also in the TP graph where they cause the formation of two highly intra-connected
clumps of nodes. To take this aspect under consideration and possibly clarify its role in respect to
the topology of both the whole drug-target network and the projections, in the following, we
compared the results of the network analyses carried out on the entire networks and on the graphs
containing all nodes except Artenimol, Fostamatinib and their exclusive direct neighbors.
As a first step in the analysis, we tried to assess the character of the monopartite projection
networks DP (278 nodes) and TP (1179 nodes), i.e., whether they belong to the random network
category or are scale-free. Scale-free networks have a characteristic organization, in which there is a
limited number of nodes with a high number of neighbors (called hubs) and an abundance of nodes
having a low degree29. This arrangement can be found in plenty of real-world networks,
from the World Wide Web to citations in science, from social interactions to metabolic maps29,30.
Both DP and TP show a significant difference from an equivalent (same number of nodes and
probability of edge creation) Erdős-Rényi graph31 (Figure S1). To further investigate on the scalefreeness of the networks, we considered three properties for each graph: the degree distribution,
the relationship between clustering coefficient and degree, and the ability to withstand targeted
attacks compared to random failures.
In order to address the scale-free character of both networks by evaluating the fitness of the degree
distribution to a power-law, we employed the approach reported by Broido et al.32, which applied a
previously defined rigorous method33. This analysis was carried out on both the entire DP and TP
networks and also in cases where Artenimol and Fostamatinib as well as their exclusive direct
neighbors were removed.

In the Drug Projections, the degree distribution could be described by a power-law, suggesting that
these networks are plausibly scale-free (Figure S2a,b). However, other heavy-tailed distributions
cannot be ruled out. The situation for the Target Projections is less clear-cut (Figure S2c,d), at least
in the case of the entire network. To advance an explanation for these results, we observe that, these
networks are small, such that they would probably not provide enough data for clearly electing a
distribution form. Still, they are unequivocally dissimilar to random networks.
The inspection of both the clustering coefficient and the robustness evaluation is best illustrated
considering the two projections one at a time.
Looking at the DP network and specifically at its clustering coefficient, it shows a tendency to
decrease as the degree increases (Figure S3a,b), implicating the existence of a few hubs connecting
peripheral nodes of high degree. Also, there is an evident distinction between the response to a
targeted attack and to a random failure34 (Figure S4a). In the first case, nodes with the highest
degree are progressively removed from the network, causing it to break apart quickly. On the other
hand, if the nodes to be dismissed are chosen randomly, the connectedness of the network is almost
unaffected. Notably, these findings are strengthened by the fact that carrying out the same
investigation on a network from which Artenimol and Fostamatinib are excluded, leads to almost
identical results (Figure S4b).
The same examination carried out on the TP network does not yield equally unambiguous
conclusions. As stated above, the targets linked to Artenimol and Fostamatinib compose two
almost-clique aggregations, which distort the morphology of the network. The relationship between
clustering coefficient and degree is strongly dependent on the presence of these two exceptionally
connected drugs (Figure S3c,d). When they are not taken into account, the inverse proportionality
is fairly visible. Nevertheless, if they are considered, the scatterplot displaying this relationship is
warped, due to the formation of two separate but remarkably dense groups representing the targets
connected to Artenimol and Fostamatinib. The check of the robustness of the network by comparing
the responses to targeted attacks or random failures gives a result that agrees with that obtained

from the DP network. The communities related to the two “super-spreaders” simply introduce a
delay in the fragmentation of the network, since they are made of a multitude of nodes with equally
high degree (Figure S4c,d). Anyhow, this shift does not alter the network robustness to random
failures and the susceptibility to targeted attacks.
As a final remark on the networks organization, we stress that all results and conclusions presented
here are just a snapshot of the continuously evolving COVID-19 drug repurposing scene, and that it
will be worthwhile to follow the time progression of this system. For instance, in the future, the
growth of the network could smooth out or even hide the effects of Artenimol and Fostamatinib that
now we observe so evidently. In respect of this, we recognize a different response of the DP and
TP networks to the influence of these nodes. The former is less affected, since the vast majority
of the targets related to both drugs are not shared by others, such that the information related to
these proteins vanishes in the projection process. On the contrary, the latter suffers a huge impact,
showing a situation that is antithetical to the previous one. Here, the proteins amass together
constituting two highly intra-connected jumbles, which are poorly linked to the rest of the
network. A continuous growth and the ability of self-organizing are two key features of scale-free
networks, which frequently describe real complex systems29. These characteristics are shown by
both projections, and indeed their scale-freeness is supported by their degree distribution, the
relation of clustering coefficient to degree, and their robustness. Mainly due to the influence
of Artenimol and Fostamatinib, these properties are manifest in the DP network, but not so neat in
the TP one.
Applications to COVID-19 Repurposed Drugs: Network-based Inferences
To illustrate the capabilities of COVIDrugNet, in the following, we report some example
considerations that can be derived from the analysis of the projection graphs of both drugs (DP) and
targets (TP).

Examining the DP network with nodes colored by ATC code
(https://www.whocc.no/atc/structure_and_principles/) (Figure 2b) can reveal at a glance which
therapeutic areas are mostly covered by the repurposed drugs presently in clinical trials. In the
Charts and Plots section of the COVIDrugNet Drug Projection page, the nodes categories
distribution is shown, from which it appears that all the 14 main anatomical/pharmacological groups
(1st level codes) are represented, even though with different numbers of drugs. Not taking into
consideration the 49 substances for which an ATC code is not yet reported, the remaining 229 drugs
are distributed in three top ranked groups: C (Cardiovascular system), A (Alimentary tract and
metabolism), and J (Antiinfectives for systemic use) comprising 40, 38, and 38 active substances,
respectively (Figure 3). Then, two other highly populated ATC groups follow: B (Blood and blood
forming organs), and L (Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents) counting 32 and 30 drugs,
respectively. By considering the composition of the bars that reports the distribution of drugs in the
3rd level groups for each 1st level ATC code (visible in the web tool), one can have a more detailed
picture of the actual pharmacological approaches to COVID-19 treatment. First, it is worth noting
that the drugs belonging to the J group are located mostly out of the main connected component of
the graph, accordingly to the fact that they share a target with a very small number of other drugs.
Conversely, substances of the A and C groups mostly populate the main connected component,
indicating a high level of promiscuity among them as regards the targets. Also, we observe that
most drugs classified in the C, A, J, B, L, N, and P groups show just one ATC code, while drugs in
D, G, R, S, M, and H belong to more than one ATC group.
Even though the ATC system is not aimed at providing direct therapeutic indications and
considering also that more than one code can be assigned to individual medicines, the landscape of
pharmacological interventions against the SARS-CoV-2 infection emerging form the DP network
appears rather intricate. Overall, it mostly confirms that the drugs in clinical trials are aimed at
contrasting both the viral infection process (antivirals in J group, agents acting on the reninangiotensin system in C group), and its pathological consequences at systemic level (substances in
12

A, B, L, and other groups). These approaches are in line with evidence recognizing that, as the
severity of the COVID-19 increases - apparently in consequence of a dysregulated host immune
response - various pathophysiological mechanisms are activated leading to hematological (mainly
thromboembolic) manifestations and, eventually, multi-organ dysfunctions35,36. In addition,
bacterial superinfections have been reported in COVID-19 patients, and even though the issue is
still debated37, antibiotics belonging to the J group are actually in the current treatment guidelines38.
Indeed, even this brief analysis of the ATC codes distribution among the substances currently in
clinical trials highlights a complex and multifaceted drug repurposing scenario consequent to the
fact that the COVID-19 is a multi-systemic disease requiring a well-equipped therapeutic
armamentarium and possibly a combined poly-pharmacological intervention39. However, as it
appears from watching the DT network of Figure 2a, some of the drugs considered for therapy are
reported to hit such a great number of targets, that it becomes difficult to identify a precise
mechanistic hypothesis at the basis of their use. On the other hand, it is conceivable that the
promiscuity of these drugs might help counteract the multiple pathological manifestations
consequent to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the viral infection process itself. For example,
in the case of Fostamatinib, in the next section, we show that it is able to hit multiple targets
involved in critical viral processes, a mechanism that might be at the basis of its favorable preclinical profile40.
Targets
The TP network of Figure 2c is a targetome that shows the relationships among the targets of the
proposed COVID-19 drugs. Here, two nodes (proteins) are linked if they are reported as targets of
at least one of the drugs in the DrugBank COVID-19 database. The network is made by 1179 nodes
and 70794 edges, and shows a main connected component comprising 1011 nodes (85.8%). Human
targets are 1013 (884 in the main connected component).

Looking at this graph provides another point of view on the pharmacological approaches taken to
contrast the COVID-19. The network of the targets involved in the action of the drugs in clinical
trials helps one to obtain a comprehensive view of the biological processes affected by the action of
drugs. Actually, from the analysis of the target proteins and their interactions it could be possible to
trace the cellular pathways influenced by drugs. A study in this regard is currently underway.
Instead, starting from the TP network, we carried out a different analysis that took into
consideration both the data here presented on repurposed drugs now in clinical trials (a top-down
view), and the molecular data on SARS-CoV-2 infection obtained from recent experimental studies
and exploited to propose drugs to be repurposed (a bottom-up view). As regards the latter, we refer
to the human-virus interactomes developed by Gordon et al.23 and more recently by Chen et al.41.
These interactomes are protein-protein interaction networks that show which human proteins are
bound directly by SARS-CoV-2 proteins to allow the virus to enter into the human cells, replicate,
assemble and be released. Both research groups followed an experimental approach to identify the
human proteins, using affinity purification (AP), and AP together with proximity labeling-based
techniques, respectively, coupled with mass spectrometry. Merging the Gordon and Chen results,
we obtained an extended list of 732 human proteins experimentally identified as interactors of the
29 viral proteins. Comparing this list with that of the drug targets of the TP network, we found that
only 45 out of the 732 human proteins able to bind the viral ones are present in the TP as reported
targets of drugs in clinical trials. In Figure 4, we show the integrated host-virus interactome (also
available in the Advanced Tools block of COVIDrugNet), where the 45 proteins common to both
lists are highlighted (yellow circles). We also checked the DT network of Figure 2a for drugs
associated with these 45 targets and found 28 substances acting on them (Table 3). They are shown
in the interactome of Figure 4 (green squares) linked to their targets. Note that these 28 substances
hit direct neighbors of the viral proteins, thus interfering with the related viral processes. Moreover,
we see from Figure 4 that Artenimol and Fostamatinib, seemingly by virtue of their high target

allowing to foresee a better therapeutic efficacy. All in all, if confirmed by clinical results, these
would be clear examples of poly-pharmacological multi-target actions exerted by single substances,
a nice fit into the paradigm of network pharmacology.
Another interesting aspect emerging from inspection of the interactome of Figure 4 is that 20
human proteins (blue circles with pink contour) bind to two viral targets, thus acting as bridges
between two node communities and playing a key role in the formation of the large connected
component of the graph (Table 4). From a drug discovery perspective, such proteins would be ideal
targets to fight the virus, as neutralizing them would help to disrupt the network of interactions
necessary to carry on the viral infection and replication processes. Unfortunately, none of these
proteins appear in the TP network, implying that there is no substance targeting them among those
listed in the DrugBank database of repurposed drugs presently in clinical trial. However, we
browsed some databases (DrugBank11, DrugCentral42 and ChEMBL9) in the search for bioactive
substances reported to bind these 20 proteins and found that 4 of them are reported as targets of
known drugs (Table 5). As can be seen from Table 5, many of the drugs listed therein have not yet
been considered for therapy, while some of them are already in clinical trial for COVID-19
treatment even though their action on the proteins in the interactome is not reported in DrugBank.
The former ones could be further possible candidates for COVID-19 drug repurposing in light of
their ability to interfere with more than one process critical for the virus.

Limitations
Our study is not exempt from some drawbacks that are common in data analysis, and regard mainly
the data availability and quality. We based COVIDrugNet on the DrugBank Dashboard dedicated to
COVID-19 pandemic, and although this public and free resource is known for the high reliability of
the datasets, missing data or delayed updating can occur. This is evident for some drugs under
clinical trial shown in Table 5 that have known targets yet not reported in their DrugBank file.
Moreover, not all the drugs or proteins investigated here are completely characterized and
15

classified, and this adds some uncertainty and noise to our results. Also, some bias could be
incorporated in the knowledge we started from. For instance, the number of targets associated to a
specific drug could considerably depend on the amount of research carried out on that medicine
rather than on the actual biological interactions it has. This issue could be partially mitigated by a
more extensive integration of data from a wider variety of databases. Very similar considerations
can be drawn on the other databases that we exploited to retrieve auxiliary data: STRING43,
DisGeNet44, SWISS-MODEL45, RCSB-PDB46, UniProt47 and ChEMBL9. Furthermore, as
mentioned in the “Methods” section, the drug-target network was built considering only protein
targets, hence nucleic acid targets were not included. However, biomolecular targets other than
proteins are a minority48 and this led us to not integrate them.
Despite the massive efforts of the scientific community, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 continue to
be largely puzzling. Experimental assays are the solid ground on which we all start to build our
hypotheses, yet also these investigations may have bias and a moderate amount of uncertainty. We
have to keep this into consideration, when examining the merged interactomes by Gordon et al.23
and Chen et al.41 given their considerable difference. Additionally, the identification of a proteinprotein interaction in vitro unfortunately does not guarantee that the same interaction occurs also in
vivo.

Conclusions
The COVID-19 pandemic poses a huge problem of public health that requires the implementation
of all available approaches to contrast it, and drugs are one of them. In this context, we observed an
unmet need of depicting the continuous evolving scenario of the ongoing drug clinical trials through
an easy-to-use freely accessible online tool. Starting from this consideration, we developed
COVIDrugNet, a web app that allows one to watch and keep up to date on how the drug research is
responding with its arsenal of known repurposed drugs to the health threat represented by the
16

SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have shown some examples of how one could explore the whole
landscape of medicines currently in clinical trial and try to probe the consistency of actual
treatments with the biological evidence being accumulated on the virus infection and its systemic
pathological consequences in humans. The complex network of protein targets affected by the
repurposed drugs can be confronted with the host-virus interactome, and this may offer new hints
on drugs currently in use or to be proposed for clinical investigation. From this comparison, we
have been able to single out some human proteins that contact two viral counterparts, and that might
be possible new targets for anti-COVID-19 drugs. Finally, given that, as already noticed by others7,
several treatments proposed for COVID-19 are still lacking a known mechanism of viral inhibition
or even a pharmacological rationale, careful analyses of the drug-target data as those reported in the
present work might help to understand the molecular implications of these pharmacological options,
and eventually improve the search for more effective therapies.

Methods
Data Acquisition
The set of drugs in clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19 (659 at January 14th 2021) was
retrieved from the dedicated web page of DrugBank (https://www.drugbank.ca/covid-19). Both
experimental unapproved substances, and drugs in clinical trials were considered, and duplicates
were removed (more than one trial is going on for some drugs). The set was also filtered for
both the number of heavy atoms (to exclude inorganic compounds), and the availability of data (a
drug was not added if it was not present in the PubChem database). This cleaning step reduced the
number of drugs considered to 375. From the same site and from PubChem, we gathered some
features related to structure, as well as pharmacological classification, pharmacodynamics, and
pharmacokinetics of each drug (Table 1). Drugs for which no targets were reported
in DrugBank were discarded (278 remaining). As regards the drug targets, they were retrieved from
DrugBank, and in this case we collected some information on classification, biology, and

pharmacology of each protein. A detailed description of the features and the data sources are
reported in Table 2.
Networks Construction
We chose to inspect the data in the form of a graph. All networks presented in the web app and in
the paper were built by means of the NetworkX software49.
Network Analysis
Node Attributes
Some suitable node attributes (Degree, Closeness Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, Eigenvector
Centrality, Clustering Coefficient, VoteRank) were calculated through NetworkX. The only
property we tweaked was the result of the VoteRank because its algorithm draws up a ranking of
nodes based on an iterative voting system50 without assigning a specific value to each one of them.
Thus, we translated this ranking into a score for each node on the basis of its position and the total
number of nodes with the following method:
IF node in rank
score = length(rank) - index_in_rank(node)
ELSE
score = 0
Nodes Grouping
Dividing a network into groups, clusters, or communities could be useful to unveil not trivial
patterns of interaction. It is accomplished by splitting the network into subgroups that have the
fewest possible number of connections between them51. In this work, we took advantage of (and
provide access to in the webtool) three of the most common algorithms for this purpose: spectral
clustering26, Girvan-Newman community detection27, and greedy modularity community
detection28.
The first one makes use of the spectrum of the graph Laplacian to convey the information about the
18

graph partition26. The division is then carried out on this data by a k-means clustering algorithm
(see the Supplementary Information for more detail). In the second case, communities are
recognized employing the Girvan-Newman method27. It is a hierarchical method based on the
progressive removal of the edges with the highest betweenness centrality from the graph, causing it
to break into sets of smaller constituents. The partition with the best modularity is shown, but the
user can manually choose an arbitrary number of communities in the web tool. The greedy
modularity community detection method28 pursues the graph division through a bottom-up
approach (opposite to the previous one), by exploiting a “greedy” algorithm that progressively
associates the nodes into groups that maximize the modularity. It starts with all nodes separated into
single communities and recursively merges the couple of them that brings to the highest modularity
increasing, until the point that joining two communities would lead to a modularity reduction.
These tasks were accomplished through in-house Python scripts, mainly making use of the packages
NetworkX and Scikit-learn52.
Degree Distribution Fitting
A network is commonly considered to be scale-free if the degree distribution of its nodes follows a
power-law29, which has the form:
𝑝(𝑥) ∝ 𝑥 −𝛼
where the scaling exponent α is higher than 1 (usually between 2 and 3) and the degree value x is
equal or greater than xmin (which is always higher than 1). To the best of our knowledge, the most
severe scale-freeness test is presented by Broido et al.32 that take advantage of a rigorous
mathematical procedure33 to assess the validity of a power-law distribution to describe the
investigated degrees. Here, we followed their approach probing the fitting of a power-law to the
degree distributions of both projected networks DP and TP (with and without the Artenimol and
Fostamatinib nodes). As a first step, the parameters of the best fitting power-law are determined
(xmin with a standard Kolmogorov-Smirnov minimization approach, and then α with a discrete
19

maximum likelihood estimation) employing the Python package Powerlaw53. Then, the fitting is
evaluated considering the p-value of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance (computed with a semiparametric bootstrap), and of the xmin and α (bootstrap). If p ≥ 0.1, the degree distribution is
considered plausibly scale-free. Lastly, the chosen power-law distribution is compared to four nonscale-free alternatives (using loglikelihood ratio tests), to evaluate if it is favored over the others.
Such alternatives are the exponentially truncated power-law, the exponential, the stretched
exponential (Weibull) and the lognormal. This entire procedure was carried out using an in-house
Python script, with a large employment of the Python package Powerlaw. A more thorough
explanation and method validation are provided in the Supplementary Information.
Robustness
Scale-free networks (contrary to random Erdős-Rényi graphs) have an exceptional tolerance against
random failures, but at the same time they are very vulnerable to targeted attacks34. We investigated
the robustness of these networks evaluating their diameter (as a measure of interconnectivity)
throughout a process of node removal. We took into account both targeted attacks and random
failures and compared the results. In the first case, at every iteration the node with the highest
degree was chosen and removed. In the other case, a node was selected randomly and eliminated. In
this latter condition, the average of multiple 100 runs was considered in order to avoid
misinterpretations induced by a single random choice. This procedure was carried out through an
in-house Python script.
COVIDrugNet Implementation and Deployment
COVIDrugNet is mainly composed by the collector and the web tool itself. Both are written in
Python, but the purpose of the former is to collect the data from web databases, build the graphs,
compute some properties, and store everything in pickle format. The latter, instead, retrieves the
data from the created database and sets up the front-end part of COVIDrugNet with Python Dash54.

(anatomical/pharmacological main group). The total count is higher than the number of nodes in the
DP because more than one ATC code can be assigned to a single drug.
Figure 4. Virus-Host-Drug Interactome
The Virus-Host-Drug Interactome built on the basis of the merged datasets from Gordon et al.23 and
Chen et al.41. Proteins (circles) are displayed in red if viral and in blue if human. The human
proteins present in the TP network are shown as yellow circles, and the corresponding drugs
currently in clinical trials against COVID-19 as green squares. The human proteins binding more
than one viral target are highlighted as blue circles with pink contour. The network visualization
was generated through Cytoscape 3.8.256.
