Abstract Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been

13

declared a public health emergency of international concerns. Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is a critical clinical symptom of severe

14

COVID-19 patients, and the macrophage is recognized as the direct host cell of SARS-CoV-2 and potential drivers of CSS. In the present study,

15

peramivir was identified to reduce TNF-α by partly intervention of NF-κB activity in LPS-induced macrophage model. In vivo, peramivir

16

reduced the multi-cytokines in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), alleviated the acute lung injury and prolonged the survival time

in mice. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs), peramivir could also inhibit the release of TNF-α. Collectively, we proposed

18

that peramivir might be a candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 and other infections related CSS.

INTRODUCTION

28

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been reported to

29

infect more than 12 million people worldwide killing 500 thousand people (updated on Jul 10th, 2020).1 World Health Organization (WHO) has

30

declared COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concerns.2 COVID-19 patients show typical clinical symptoms of fever,

31

fatigue, dry cough and pneumonia.3-5 Excessive inflammatory response leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coagulopathy, and

32

septic shock which can be fatal in critical cases.3 Gross anatomy identifies the main pathological features including exudation and hemorrhage,

33

epithelium injuries, infiltration of inflammatory immune cells and fibrosis in the lungs of fatal patients.3, 6-10

34

A syndrome with a distinct cytokine storm was showed in a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19, which has also been reported in

35

SARS-CoV infected patients.11-14 The cytokine storm refers to an uncontrolled excessive inflammatory response, spreading from a local lesion to

36

the whole body through the systemic circulation.15, 16 The plasma concentrations of inflammation related cytokines such as interleukins (IL) -2,

37

-6, -7, and -10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP10), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF),

38

monocyte chemoattractant protein -1 (MCP-1), and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1α) were significantly increased in the

39

COVID-19 patients.3, 17, 18 Specially, the activation of alveolar macrophages was a characteristic abnormality.8

40

The leading cause of mortality is thought to be ARDS-induced respiratory failure, and patients generally receive supportive management in

41

clinic practice.17 However, there is still no well-accepted effective treatment for COVID-19. The development of novel therapeutics has been

42

mainly focused on antivirals19, 20 and vaccines.11 In addition, the cytokine storm is increasingly being recognized as a key node for the patients

43

deteriorating to severe COVID-19.3, 11, 17 Therefore, anti-inflammatory therapy has been considered as one of appropriate clinical adjuvant

treatment options, and the treatments include steroids (e.g., prednisone),21 selective cytokine blockade (e.g., tocilizumab),11 JAK inhibition (e.g.,

45

Baricitinib),22 intravenous immunoglobulin, Chinese medicines and blood purification.11, 21

46

Early in Feb, 2020, 75 of 99 COVID-19 patients received antiviral treatment including oseltamivir.23 Besides, oseltamivir is noted to have

47

been widely used for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases in hospitals in China24 and Thailand (NCT04303299). The other two clinical trials

48

(NCT04261270 and NCT04255017) involving oseltamivir in the treatment of COVID-19 are currently ongoing. However, the FDA-approved

49

neuraminidase inhibitors including oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir were ineffective against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro.25 There has

50

been no exact evidence to date that oseltamivir is effective in the treatment of COVID-19 in clinic.19

51

It is reported that oseltamivir exhibited the antiviral activity of reducing pulmonary viral load, thereby the cytokines production was

52

suppressed.26 Macrophages play a vital role in both SARS-CoV-2 virus -induced lung lesions and the host cytokine-mediated response.8 In our

53

previous study, entecavir, a hepatitis B virus (HBV) inhibitor, was demonstrated to directly inhibit the release of cytokines in lipopolysaccharide

54

(LPS) -stimulated macrophage model,27 which is a classic in vitro model to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of the drugs.28 Herein, we

55

also examined whether these three neuraminidase inhibitors could inhibit the expression of inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated

56

macrophages in the present study. The results showed peramivir had the best ability to inhibit TNF-α by ~70% among the three compounds.

57

Furthermore, we estimated the anti-cytokine storm effect and lung protection of peramivir in vivo. The anti-inflammatory effect of peramivir in

58

human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) was also observed.

61

Materials

62

Compounds were purchased from TargetMol with a purity of > 98% (TargetMol). LPS (E. coli 0111:B4) was obtained from MilliporeSigma.

63

Animal

64

Male C57BL/6J mice (18-22 g) were purchased from the Changzhou Cavens Laboratory Animal Co., China. All mice were kept under an

65

automated 12 h dark-light cycle at a controlled temperature of 22°C ± 2°C and a relative humidity of 50%– 60% with free access to standard dry

66

diet and tap water. All animal experiments were carried out in adherence with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals

67

(National Academies Press, 2011) and were approved by the Second Military Medical University Committee on Animal Care (EC11-055).

68

CCS model

69

CCS was induced by a single i.p. injection of LPS (15 mg/kg), as described previously.29 After 4 h, mice were sacrificed and serum was collected.

70

After 8 h, the left bronchus was ligated and 1 mL saline was perfused into right lung lobe to collect BALF, and the left lung was fixed with

71

paraformaldehyde for histological analysis. Serum and BALF were further used for multi-cytokine analysis.

72

To investigate the effect of drugs on the survival time of CSS model mice, a single i.p. injection of saline (n=10), peramivir (20 and 60 mg/kg,

73

n=10) was performed at 1 h before i.p. injection of a lethal dose of LPS (30 mg/kg) to mice, respectively. After modeling, mice survival was

74

recorded every 2 h until 40 h.

75

Preparation of the peritoneal macrophages

76

The peritoneal macrophages were obtained from the mice after i.p. injection of 3 ml of 3% thioglycolate as described previously.29 Briefly, the

77

mice were sacrificed, and the macrophages were isolated by lavage with 5 ml of RPMI 1640 (Gibco Life Technologies), washed twice with PBS

78

after 4 h of adherence, cultured in RPMI at 37°C and 5% CO2, and finally stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS to harvest supernatants. The isolated

79

cells were used for cytokine analysis and cell viability assays.

80

Preparation of the hPBMCs

81

hPBMCs were obtained from freshly collected buffy coat fractions from healthy donors at the Tongren Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong

82

University, China. Briefly, hPBMCs were isolated by centrifugation over a Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) density gradient at 800 g

83

for 20 min at room temperature in a Sorvall RT6000B (DuPont, Wilmington, DE, USA). Most hPBMC isolates were adherence cells that mainly

84

contained macrophages and monocytes. Isolated hPBMCs were cultured in RPMI 1640, 100 U/mL penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen Life

85

Technologies), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Gibco Life Technologies). 3 × 105 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated

86

for 24 h at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. hPBMCs were pretreated with peramivir at the concentrations of 2.5, 5 and 10

87

μM at 1 h before LPS (100 ng/ml) stimulation, and the supernatants were harvested at 6 or 12 h after LPS stimulation for cytokine analysis.

88

Cell viability assay

89

Cell Counting Kit-8 (TY0312, Dojindo Molecular Technology, Japan) was used to measure cell viability. Briefly, 10 μL of CCK-8 solution was

90

added, and cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Absorbance was measured using a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-mode Reader (BioTek

91

Instruments, USA) at a wavelength of 450 nm.

92

Anti-inflammatory activity screening

93

We chose an in vitro model of LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages to induce TNF-α secretion, and screened potential anti-inflammatory

94

molecules in the antiviral and antibacterial drug library. Briefly, 100 ng/ml LPS stimulated peritoneal macrophages for 4 h with simultaneous

95

incubation of compounds at a concentration of 10 μM. The cell supernatant was diluted 10-fold and the TNF-α content was measured with a

96

mouse TNF-α Elisa kit obtained from Invitrogen. The remaining cells were subjected to CCK8 assay to detect cytotoxicity.

97

NF-κB luciferase activity assay

98

RAW264.7 cells stably transfected with an NF-κB-responsive luciferase construct, kindly provided by Prof. An Qin (Shanghai Jiaotong

99

University, China), were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well, as previously described.30 After 24 h, cells were

100

pretreated with peramivir for 1 h and stimulated with LPS for 6 h. Cells were dealt with a luciferase assay system (Promega) and the luciferase

101

activity was calculated using a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-mode Reader (BioTek Instruments, USA).

102

Western Blotting

103

Protein samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to NC membrane and blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBST. The membranes

104

were washed with TBST and then incubated with the primary antibody for 6 hours at 4 degrees Celsius. The primary antibodies (1:1000) used

105

were all from Cell Signaling Technology, USA and listed as follows: GAPDH antibody(#2118), stat3 antibody(#12640), phospho-stat3

106

antibody(#98543), SAPK/JNK antibody(#9252), phospho-SAPK/JNK antibody(#4668), p65 antibody(#4764), phospho-p65 antibody(#3033),

108

phospho-p38 MAPK antibody(#4511), Erk1/2 antibody(#4695) and phospho-Erk1/2 antibody(#4370). Then, the membranes were incubated in

109

HRP-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG Antibody (1:10000, Cell Signaling Technology, USA, #7074) at room temperature for 1 hour and signals were

110

detected by chemiluminescence (Bio rad, USA).

112

TNF-α released by mouse peritoneal macrophages was measured by a Mouse TNF-α ELISA Kit (Invitrogen, BMS607-3TEN) according to the

113

manufacturer’s protocol. TNF-α released by hPBMCs were measured by Human TNF-α ELISA Kit (Youda, 1117202) according to the

114

manufacturer’s protocol.

115

Multi-cytokine measurement

116

The serum levels of a total of 12 virus-related cytokines were measured by a bead-based immunoassay panel (Mouse Anti-Virus Panel, Cat No:

117

740622, Biolegend, USA). The BALF levels of a total of 12 inflammatory cytokines were measured by a bead-based immunoassay panel

118

(Mouse Inflammation Panel, Cat No: 740446, Biolegend, USA) on CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, USA) according to the

119

manufacturer’s protocol.

120

Immunofluorescence staining

121

Isolated peritoneal macrophages in eight-well LabTek slides (PEZGS0816, Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA) were pretreated with

122

peramivir one hour before cell were simulated by LPS at a concentration of 1μg /ml for 30 min. Then cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,

123

blocked with 0.4% Triton X-100/2% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h, and then incubated with primary antibodies for p65

124

(CST, #8242, 1:400 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. After being washed with PBST 3 times, the samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488

125

(Beyotime, A0423, 1:500 dilution) for 1 h and washed again with PBS. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Images were obtained by confocal

126

microscopy (TCS SP5, Leica, Solms, Germany).

129

were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and were photographed with a microscope

130

(Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The histological characteristics of the lung injury (including alveolar edema and hemorrhage, the number

131

of infiltrating leukocytes, and the thickness of the alveolar wall and epithelium) were evaluated. Each histological characteristic was evaluated

132

on a scale of 0 to 3 (0, normal; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe).

133

Statistical analysis

134

Data were expressed as means ± SEM. Statistical analyses used Student’s t-test, two-way ANOVA or Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis. GraphPad

135

software was used for data analysis. Statistical significance was indicated as follows: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, n.s. not significant.

137

RESULTS

138

Peramivir is an active anti-inflammatory agent without apparent cytotoxicity.

139

The three neuraminidase inhibitors (peramivir, oseltamivir, and zanamivir, Fig. 1a) were explored for their ability to inhibit TNF-α-induced by

140

LPS in macrophages. They inhibit the elevation of TNF-α by 67.2%, 35.6% and 13.1% at 10 µM, respectively (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, peramivir

141

dose-dependently inhibited TNF-α release with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) as 4.3 µM (Fig. 1c). Given that the inhibitory

142

effect of the drugs on TNF-α might be achieved by cytotoxicity, we tested the cytotoxicity of peramivir in macrophages by a CCK-8 assay. It

143

was demonstrated that no apparent toxicity was observed in the peramivir-treated macrophages at concentrations up to 40 μM (Fig. 1d).

144

Peramivir inhibits LPS-induced cytokine storm in mice.

145

We used LPS-induced cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) mouse model to evaluate the in vivo inflammatory inhibitory activity. Peramivir was

146

administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.) at the concentration of 60 mg/kg at 1 h before LPS injection, and serum was collected at 4 h after LPS

147

injection for further experiment. Twelve cytokines in total were simultaneously measured using a mouse antivirus panel by flow cytometric bead

148

array. Compared with the control group, 7 cytokines including TNF-α, IL family (IL-6, IL-1β, IL-12), chemokines (MCP-1), interferon family

149

(IFN-α, γ) were significantly decreased by the treatment (Table 1 and Fig. S1). The other 5 cytokines including IL-10, IP-10, chemokine (C-C

150

motif) ligand 5 (CCL-5), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), CXC chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) were slightly

151

downregulated without statistical significance.

152

Given that cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) could directly represent the inflammation status in the lungs,7, 31 we examined

153

cytokines in BALF after 8 h of LPS stimulation. Twelve cytokines in total were simultaneously measured using a mouse inflammation panel by

154

flow cytometric bead array. Compared with the control group, TNF-α and IL-6 were significantly decreased by the treatment (Table 2 and Fig.

155

S2). IL-1β, IL-10, IL-17A and MCP-1 showed downregulation without significant difference.

156

Peramivir effectively attenuates acute lung injury and prolong the survival in LPS-induced mice.

157

The histological examinations of two COVID-19 death cases both showed alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, pulmonary

158

edema and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates.7, 31 The mice injected with LPS (i.p.) exhibited similar pathological features to

159

ARDS, such as infiltration of inflammatory cells (black arrow), congestion (green arrow) and edema within thickened alveolar (yellow arrow)

160

(Fig. 2a). In contrast, the alveolar structures of mice in the peramivir treated group were relatively intact, inflammatory cell infiltrations were

161

significantly reduced, and mild alveolar thickening and less bleeding points or congestion were observed (Fig. 2a). Lung injury scores were

162

calculated (Fig. 2b) to show significant protective effects of peramivir (score = 2.6 ± 0.6) to the lung tissues compared with that of control group

11

163

(score = 4.8 ± 0.33). The survival time was prolonged in mice treated with peramivir in a dose-dependent manner after an i.p. injection of a

164

lethal dose of LPS (30 mg/kg) compared with that in control mice (Fig. 2c).

165

Peramivir decreases NF-κB transcriptional activity in RAW264.7 and the peritoneal macrophages.

166

NF-κB is an important transcriptional regulator in cells that participated in inflammatory responses, of which the activation induces the

167

expression of multiple genes and production of cytokines consequently leading to cytokine storm.32 Peramivir dose-dependently inhibited

168

LPS-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity in the RAW264.7 cells with a NF-κB reporter luciferase system (Fig. 2d). Furthermore, we detected

169

some key factors in inflammation responses by western blot and found that the LPS-induced activation of NF-κB pathway (phosphorylation of

170

p65) and MAPKs (phosphorylation of p38 and Erk1/2) were inhibited after peramivir intervention (Fig. 2e). Immunofluorescence images of

171

LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages treated with or without peramivir indicated that LPS-induced nuclear translocation of p65 was

172

attenuated by peramivir (Fig. 2f).

173

Peramivir inhibits multi-cytokine releases in LPS-induced human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs).

174

Considering the translational value of peramivir in clinical practices, the release of TNF-α was tested in LPS-induced hPBMCs, which were

175

obtained from two healthy donors. Peramivir (Fig. 3a, b and Fig. S3) significantly counteracted the level of TNF-α at 6 h and 12 h in a time- and

176

dose-dependent manner without apparent toxicity.

177
178

DISCUSSION

179

The three neuraminidase inhibitors bear similar pharmacophoric side chains (black, Fig. 1a) and different core scaffolds (red, Fig. 1a). Peramivir

180

has a five-membered cyclopentanol ring, while oseltamivir and zanamivir have six-membered ring, which might be a critical part for the

181

anti-inflammatory activity in the chemical structure of view.

182

Peramivir, an intravenous neuraminidase inhibitor, was approved for the emergency use in severe influenza in 2009 by the FDA. The antiviral

183

effect of peramivir on influenza has been described previously,33 nevertheless, few studies have paid attentions to the anti-inflammatory activity

184

of peramivir. The activation of the immune system is attributed to the virus-induced cytokine response.34, 35 Inhibition of these cytokines can

185

potentially control the severity of the virus-induced inflammatory complications and finally reduce the mortality.34,

186

cytokines and influenza pathogenicity has been well correlated.36, 37 In mouse model of H1N1 influenza, peramivir inhibits the levels of TNF-α,

187

IL6 and IFN-γ in the lung tissue.38 And compared to oseltamivir, peramivir shows more obvious anti-inflammatory effect.39 The

188

anti-inflammatory effect of peramivir in vivo may be due to its antiviral symptomatic treatment, while we tried to investigate whether peramivir

189

can directly inhibit the release of cytokines by inflammatory immune cells.

190

As the neuraminidase is not expressed in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir were ineffective against the virus in

191

vitro.25 In a clinical study, 75% of the COVID-19 patients received antiviral treatment including oseltamivir and 5 of them simultaneously

192

infected with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza were recovered after treating with oseltamivir.23 We hypothesized that these neuraminidase inhibitors

193

might have other effects including anti-inflammation, indicating the adjuvant therapeutic value of neuraminidase inhibitors in COIVD-19.

194

Viruses and bacteria induce immune cell activation and release of cytokines are Toll-like receptors (TLRs) dependent.40 The induction of

195

inflammatory cytokines depends on the activation of NF-κB although they recognize different subtypes of TLRs.41 We assumed that

196

macrophages, causing the synthesis and release of inflammatory cytokines.28 TNF-α is one of the central cytokines involved in inflammation

198

initiation and amplification in virus infections,42 and is reported to be elevated in critical COVID-19 cases,3 suggesting it as a proper indicator

199

for in vitro drug screening.

200

Compared with oseltamivir, peramivir shows better inhibition of TNF-α in vitro. The reduction in TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-α, IFN-γ and

201

MCP-1 levels promoted by peramivir might play an important role in reducing stress due to the overactivated immune system and preventing

202

organ damage of infected mice. This hypothesis was confirmed by pathological examination and lung index evaluation, which found that

203

treatment with peramivir alleviated the severity of LPS-associated pneumonia and prolonged the survival time for mice. The lethal lung

204

pathology caused by LPS was due to the excessive cytokine response that was primarily produced by the activated macrophages. 28 Peramivir

205

inhibited the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in the BALF of LPS-induced mice. Furthermore, peramivir attenuated TNF-α induced by LPS both in

206

mouse peritoneal macrophages and hPBMCs, which confirmed that peramivir can inhibit the inflammatory cytokine response mediated by

207

macrophages.

208

In conclusion, the modulatory function of peramivir on LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines might contribute to the additional beneficial effect

209

of the drug in antiviral therapy. This study provides evidence for the therapeutic value of peramivir for the potential application as an

210

anti-inflammatory agent against cytokine dysregulation.
