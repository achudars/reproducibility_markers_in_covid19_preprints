Abstract: Since the beginning of the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there have been a number of
efforts to understand the mutations and clusters of genetic lines of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Until
now, phylogenetic analysis methods have been used for this purpose. Here we show that Principal
Component Analysis (PCA), which is widely used in population genetics, can not only help us to
understand existing findings about the mutation processes of the virus, but can also provide even
deeper insights into these processes while being less sensitive to sequencing gaps. Here we
describe a comprehensive analysis of a 46,046 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence dataset
downloaded from the GISAID database in June of this year.
Main Text:
With COVID-19 and its causative virus SARS-CoV-2, the world faces a pandemic that has gained
historic proportions, influencing our socio-economical system and everyday life in an
unprecedented way. On the other hand, with the rapidly evolving achievements of next-generation
sequencing (NGS) methods in recent years, we have genetic measurement methods at our disposal
which can give us deep insights into the global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Since the
onset of this pandemic, many complete genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 genome have been
collected in different locations at different times. Platforms to share this information, such as the
GISAID initiative, allow wide access to genomic data almost in real time (1, 2).
Thus, as in no pandemic before, the scientific community has been able to track the mutation
dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 during its global spread. The analysis of this mutation is of paramount
importance for a wide range of issues, from the identification and development of pathogenic
properties (3) to monitoring of changes in target regions for PCR diagnostics (4, 5), identifying
options for the development of suitable vaccines and antiviral therapeutics (6–9), and validating
non-pharmaceutical measures to curb infection dynamics (10–15).
As early as March, Islam et al found a high heterogeneity in genome-wide sequence analyses of
2,492 worldwide collected SARS-CoV-2 genomes (16). In order to see if virus lineages appear
anywhere in the world that are substantially different in terms of their treatment options,
immunological escape mechanisms or alterations concerning target regions for the PCR-diagnostic

panel, it is also important to uncover geographical differences in mutation patterns (17). However,
in order to gain these insights, it is necessary to use suitable bioinformatic methods to analyze
these gigantic data sets. So far, phylogenetic methods have been used the most often to analyze
mutation patterns (18–20). While these methods have advantages, they also have significant
drawbacks—when we start analyzing thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, the number of
mutations grows to thousands, which exacerbates this problem.
In our study, we present another method for analyzing large data sets of gene sequences—namely,
principal component analysis (PCA). The original applications of PCA to questions in the field of
population genetics helped with deriving the underlying population structure and genetic ancestry
of individuals from shared genetic mutations (21, 22).
PCA is now a well-established building block in the search for SNPs in GWAS analyses in
humans, animals and microorganisms (23). The validity of this method depends to a large extent
on the numerical recoding of the SNPs, the PCA method used and the graphical representation of
the resulting eigenvalues (24).
We conducted our investigations with the complete GISAID collection of 46,046 SARS CoV-2
sequences from human sample material downloaded on June 15th, 2020. Sequence alignment and
variant calling was done with previously described methods (25, 26) using the ASM985889v3
sequence with GenBank identifier NC_045512.2 and RNA identifier MN908947.3 based on the
original Wuhan, China sequence published in Nature (27) as reference sequence. The process of
data acquisition is described in detail in the supplementary material.
In the 46,046 SARS-CoV-22 genomes 8,258 nucleotide positions were found in which variants
occurred compared to the reference. After data trimming (see supplementary material), 62
nucleotide positions were excluded resulting in a dataset for PCA consisting of a matrix of 46,046
samples and 8,129 nucleotide positions. The sample metadata was organized into a matrix structure
as well.
The differentiation ability of PCA is decisively dependent on the coding of the mutation
events
Two PCA methods were first applied to a high-quality portion of the dataset described above
containing 20,750-genomes whose sequences had no ambiguous counts. The divergence score of
these samples was in a range of 0 to 0.0008. The matrix for performing PCA thus comprised 20,750
samples and 8,192 variant-bearing positions. This data was recoded to numeric values in the
following ways in preparation for performing PCA:
PCA1: A classical recoding of the variant matrix was carried out for this analysis. Each deviation
from the reference was marked as 1, each match as 0.
PCA2: This recoding assigns a unique value to each variant, based on the specific change to the
reference sequence: no change to the reference (A remains A, C remains C, etc.) was encoded as
0, and a modified nucleotide position was unambiguously encoded according to the defined
mutation event as shown in Table S1. To our knowledge, this type of coding in preparation for
PCA has not been used before.
Figure 1 compares the 2D plots of the major eigenvalues obtained from PCA1 (Fig. 1A) and PCA2
(Fig. 1B). The 2D plot of the two major eigenvalues according to PCA1 shows a clumsy four-arm
central cluster with two short central arms and two outer arms, each of which diffusely rejuvenates
in parallel with the x axis and the y axis. On the other hand, the 2D plot of the two major
eigenvalues from PCA2, which in its numerical encoding of the variant matrix separates a total of

13 events very neatly, separates five clusters which we describe intuitively as center (ce), straight
(st), middle right (mr), extreme right (er) and extreme left (el).
Figure S1 shows a time sequence of the 2D plot described above which is colored according to the
collection month of the sample. As Figure S1 illustrates, the cluster appearing first is the cluster
ce, starting in December, followed by cluster st in January. By the end of February, all clusters
have been pre-formed, and from March on, all other data points have accumulated around these
pre-formed clusters. The increase in the number of genome sequence data points can be found on
all five clusters, suggesting that all five basic variants that make up these clusters were active at
least until the beginning of June.
The advantage of the PCA method is that the complete variant set is analyzed rather than every
single variant by itself. In order to be able to assess the effects of sequence quality, this study did
not take the approach of excluding sequences on the basis of certain criteria, but instead included
quality markers as properties of each sample in the analysis. So, a third PCA was performed:
PCA 3: For PCA 3, recoding was performed in the same way as for PCA2, but the complete
(human-sample) data set consisting of 46,046 samples and 8,196 positions was used.
Figure S2 shows the 3D plots of eigenvalues 1,2 and 10 after PCA 2 and 3. Essentially, PCA using
the specific numerical recoding of the variant matrix of 46,046 non quality filtered SARS-CoV-2
genomes finds the same cluster pattern as does PCA using the specific numerical recoding of the
20,750 genomes with high sequence quality (Fig. 1C and D).
Figure S3 shows a 3D plot of all SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the original data set that show at
least one ambiguous nucleotide position. The data points are colored according to the number of
their ambiguous counts. You can see that the same five main clusters appear both in this dataset
and in the data set without ambiguous counts. Some of the data points with ambiguous counts
scatter more distantly around the main clusters. Having quality criteria as an attribute in the
metadata, it is therefore now possible to apply validity criteria for assignment to a cluster: As a
consequence of the recoding process, a sequence may be shifted more towards reference clusters
than it should be, but this can be taken into account if you want to analyze specific phenomena of
individual sequences. A variant pattern which lies outside common clusters is, of course, as
doubtful as the sequencing is.

Variant analysis of the PCA clusters
In order to facilitate communication about SARS-CoV-2 mutation patterns, various nomenclatures
have been established and are currently being used in parallel (28–30). Alm et al have summarized,
in a recently published communication (17), the relationships between the most common currently
used nomenclatures of lineages and clades according to Rambault et al (21), Nextstrain (29) and
GISAID (30). In our investigations, we use these nomenclatures in order to reference known
properties and origins of sequence patterns.
Using the 2-D cluster plot resulting from PCA2 of the 20,750 SARS-CoV-2 sequences without
ambiguous counts, the clusters were manually separated into individual data sets according to their
eigenvalue coordinates (Fig. 1 C-D). Cluster ce contained 7714 samples, Cluster st, 2076, cluster
mr, 1466, cluster er, 4514 and cluster el, 4900 samples. Eighty samples escaped manual clustering
and were marked as “no cluster” (nc). The entire data set and each separate cluster itself were
examined to find the frequencies of the variants (see the supplementary materials for the details).
All variants found in up to 10% of the sample sets were considered for later analysis. In the entire
data set of 20,750 genomes, four nucleotide positions were found which show a dominance of the

variant against the reference—namely, positions C241T (97.52%), C3037T (99.97%), C14408T
(99.99%) and A23403G (99.95%). These are discussed below. However, the analysis also showed
that within the clusters st, mr, er and el, variants were found which were cluster-specific and were
present in the respective cluster up to almost 100%.
Table S2 shows an overview of those variants found in each cluster that reached a frequency of at
least 10% of the cluster's samples. The cluster-specific nucleotide variants are marked in bold print,
and are for cluster st, T28144C and C8782T, for cluster el, G28883C, G28882A and G28881A,
and for the two right clusters, G25563T. These clusters differ by C1059T only being present in
cluster er, while cluster mr keeps the reference nucleotide C1059. Remarkably this cluster marking
nucleotide positions matched some marker nucleotide positions of clades and lineages described
in the above-mentioned nomenclature references (28–30). Our studies show that the variants found
in cluster st (see Figure 2) largely match the variant patterns of Nextstrain clade 19B, GISAID
clade S and lineage A of Rambault et al, cluster el matches Nextsrain clade 20B and GISAID clade
GR, and cluster er matches Nextstrain clade 20C and is, together with cluster mr, included in
GISAID clade GH. Cluster ce did not match any clusters in their clade system while the clusters
we defined through principal component analysis did not have any matches with Nextstrain clades
19A or 20A or GISAID clade G. Nextstrain clade 20A differs from 19A bearing variants C3037T,
C14408T and A23403G (29) and GISAID clade G is defined by variants C241T, C3037T and
A23403G. These variant nucleotide positions were found across clusters in the majority of SARSCoV-2 genomes. Figure S4 shows the distribution of different patterns of nucleotide positions 241,
3037, 14408 and 23403 with pattern 1: C241 and any reference/variant combination of 3037,
14408 and 23403 (in short C-X-X-X), pattern 2: T-X-X-X, pattern 3: C-T-T-G and pattern 4: TT-T-G. Pattern 4 is, with 44267 samples, by far the most distributed combination of these positions.
Pattern 3 occurs 1168 times, pattern 2, 450 times, and pattern 1, 161 times. All combinations can
be found in each cluster. We analyzed the relative frequencies of the patterns in China, UK, USA,
and Australia, as well as the remaining countries as combined into their WHO regions. As figure
S5 show, pattern 1,2 and 4 mirror more or less exactly the weighting of the GISAID submission
countries, whereas pattern 3 has a remarkable weighting in Australia, Americas and the Eastern
Mediterranean. The 14408 mutation is associated with changes in the RdRp gene (9), while the
other variant positions are associated with variants of the spike protein S-D614G (31), which could
be associated with higher infectivity and higher viral loads (3),(32). Based on our data, it should
be noted that the combination of all these variants is the by far most prevalent variant pattern (96%
of the samples) for the virus independently of all other variations found. However, due to the
ubiquitous distribution of all variations of these nucleotide combinations in all clusters, we
excluded them as markers for our further investigations.
Defining subclusters by extracting patterns of the variants found in the clusters obtained
after PCA
For further analysis, the clusters were not manually isolated based on the principal components,
but rather the sequences were mapped to a cluster using the cluster-specific markers described
(Table S2) and then plotted in order to see, if they clustered at the expected cluster locations.
Figures 2A and 2B show the 3D plots of eigenvalues 1, 2 and 10, highlighting the cluster mappings
st, mr, er, and el. All sequences that did not bear any of the cluster-specific variants were assigned
to cluster ce. Figure 2B shows that even in the entire 46,046-sample dataset, the clusters can also
be distinguished by the cluster-specific variants obtained by means of PCA and subsequent variant
analysis.

Subclusters for each such cluster were obtained by first, taking each sample's data for all variant
positions of the cluster occurring at least 10% of the time within that cluster and merging that data
into one metadata field, then using this metadata field to evaluate which combinations of these
variants occurred for how many samples. The most common combinations were identified as
subclusters. Details of this method and the systematics to name the subclusters are described in the
supplementary material. Figure 3B gives an overview of the subclusters, their variant patterns, and,
for each subcluster, the number of genome sequences that could be mapped to it. Figure 3A shows
a 2D plot according to the two major eigenvalues based on PCA 3 of the entire 46,046 data set,
colored by assignment to these subclusters and shows how close the sequence lines are, especially
in the central clusters ce, st and mr.
Cluster center (ce)
Cluster Center is the first cluster to have formed in the course of the pandemic. Its origin lies in
Wuhan (information from the GISAID metadata) and contains the least variant-bearing genome
sequences. As a result of our study, we found, in this 19,629-genome cluster, 5 subclusters defined
by the pattern of their variant-bearing positions—this pattern is summarized in Figure 3B. The
subcluster ce-0 showed the reference sequence G11083, G26144, C14805 and A20268 in all of
these nucleotide positions. It is the largest subcluster with 12,280 genomes. Subclusters ce-A-v3
and ce-A-2 share G11083T. ce-A-2 comprises 3499 genome sequences with the other variants
C14805T and G26144T. Subcluster ce-A-v3 includes all other variant patterns that have G11083T
and contains 1499 genome sequences. Subcluster ce-1, with 2077 genomes, is defined by variant
A20268G, and the remaining 324 sequences that could not be grouped into any of the other
subclusters are found in ce-v3. Since we have no longer used nucleotide positions 241, 3037, 14408
and 23403 for further analysis, as discussed above, the classifications of Clades 19A/20A
according to the definitions of Nextstrain and of Clade G according to GISAID are only indirectly
possible. The Nextstrain Clade definition does not differentiate the ce and mr subclusters found
here and would be grouped as 19A/20A in the absence of all marker positions, while GISAIDClade G would fall into the cluster ce and its subcluster in the absence of all other marker positions.
Since the GISAID clades L and V differ in terms of variants G11083T and G26144T, Clade V
sequences would be found in the ce-A-2 subcluster and the Clade L sequences in the other center
clusters other than ce-A-v3.
Cluster straight (st)
Cluster st also formed very early in the pandemic in Wuhan. The nucleotide positions of the
variants defining the cluster can be found in Table 3. This 3,545-genome cluster is separated into
4 subclusters according to the pattern of their variant bearing positions, as summarized in Figure
3B. The following reference/variant combinations were most commonly found and were grouped
into subclusters. Subcluster st-0 with 1,025 sequences has the reference sequence in all these
positions, while subcluster st-3 with 1,637 genomes has the variants 18060T, 17858G, and
17747A, while the remaining nucleotide positions correspond to the reference. Subcluster st-5 has
variants 9477A, 14805T, 28657T, 28863T and 2979T while the remaining nucleotide positions
correspond to the reference. 117 genomes did not fall into any of the subclusters and were grouped
into subcluster st-v8.
Cluster middle right (mr)

The mr cluster was found as a new, previously undescribed cluster. This cluster became visible by
means of principal component analysis as used in the present study. It comprises 2,463 genomes
which had G25563T as a common feature, along with not having variant T in nucleotide position
C1059. (Variant T would have placed these into cluster er—see the extreme right column in Fig.
3B.) The mr cluster is separated into 7 subclusters according to the pattern of their variant-bearing
positions, as summarized in Figure 3B.
The following reference/variant combinations were most commonly found in cluster mr and
grouped into subclusters: Subcluster mr-0 with 230 sequences shows the reference sequence in all
these locations, while subcluster mr-2, which comprises 261 genomes, deviates from this by
having variants 1594T and 11109T. Subcluster mr-A-0, with 770 genomes, differs from subcluster
mr-0 by the presence of variant 18877T, while mr-A-1, with 330 genomes, additionally shows
variant 26735T. Cluster mr-B-0 differs from cluster mr-0 by variant 2416T, while mr-B-1 differs
from mr-B-0 by the additional variant 20578T. Twenty genomes did not fall into any of these
subclusters and were grouped into subcluster mr-v3.

Cluster extreme right (er)
The clusters er and mr together comprise 10,224 genomes, all of which have variant 25563T. The
vast majority, namely 7,761 genomes, also have variant 1059T and thus belong to the cluster er.
In cluster er there is only one variant as high as 10%, namely, with 10%, C27964T. 715 sequences
show this variant and form subcluster er-1. 6,980 sequences show the reference position C27964
and form the larger subcluster er-0.
Cluster extreme left (el)
This 12,653-genome cluster is separated into 3 subclusters according to the pattern of their variant
bearing positions as summarized in Figure 3B. The following reference/variant combinations have
been grouped into subclusters: Subcluster el-0 with 11,077 sequences shows the reference
sequence in all these positions, while cluster el-2 with 1,532 genomes instead shows the variants
in all these positions. Subcluster el-v2 summarizes the remaining 44 genomes, each of which has
a variant at either one or the other of these nucleotide positions but not both.
Clusters and subclusters and their temporal and geographical dynamics
These clusters and subclusters were also analyzed with regard to the temporal and geographical
origin of the samples contained therein, taking into account the country or region of exposure and
the month of sampling. To track the variant clusters over time, the collecting month for each
sample was used if it had been included in the record.
In order to get an impression of the geographical coverage of the data, the information on the
countries of exposure contained in the metadata has been categorized into 6 regions according to
the WHO classification, with the exception that the three largest submission countries—the United
Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA), Australia (AUS)—and China (CH) as the
country of origin of the pandemic were categorized separately from their respective WHO regions.
The data was compared with the data status of the WHO Situation Report of 06/08/2020 (33), the
last sampling date of the GISAID dataset. It is important to note that the data collection has a
strong weighting: the vast majority of isolates in GISAID came from the UK, which accounted for
almost half of the total data set with 21,432 samples. The US ranked second in GISAID, with 8,820
sequences, which accounted for about 20% of the GISAID dataset. The remaining 30% of the
sequences were accounted for by the other countries and regions. The Central and South American
countries of Brazil, Peru, Chile and Mexico were under-represented, as were the Eastern

Mediterranean (EM) with countries such as Iran, which according to the WHO report of
06/08/2020 was among the first 10 countries with the most COVID-19 cases, but which had a total
of just under 300 sequences—less than a fifth of the number of isolates from the Netherlands,
which ranked 4th among the GISAID submitters. A complete analysis of the data is provided in
the supplementary material.
The different geographical distribution of the clusters in different WHO-regions and in the UK,
the USA, Australia and China are shown in Figure 4 with Figure 4A highlighting from which
regions and countries the genome sequences assigned to each cluster originate and Figure 4B how
the clusters are distributed across regions and countries. Because of the strong weighting of the
data sets, each graph shows the total distribution of the clusters or geographic regions for
comparison. The sequences of the three most common exposure regions are distributed very
differently between the clusters. Sequences from the UK account for just over 50% of the
sequences of the cluster ce and about 70% of the sequences of the cluster el, but are found in the
other clusters significantly less, namely between 5-15%. Sequences from the USA, on the other
hand, are disproportionately distributed between the clusters st, mr and er, where they make up
about 45%, 30% and 60% of the sequences. Sequences from Europe are very evenly distributed
across all clusters, where they make up about 15-25% of the sequences. The weights that are
presented here fit with the results of other authors, who mainly assign cluster el (equivalent to
Nextstrain 20C and GISAID GR) to Europe and cluster er ( equivalent to Nextstrain 20B and part
of GISAID GH) mainly in North America (29, 31). The cluster mr, which is described here for
the first time as a variant pattern, is the smallest cluster with a share of about 5%, but shows
remarkable weightings in the WHO regions which are less represented in the GISAID dataset,
such as EM, where it can be assigned 1/3 of the sequences, and such as SEA and Americas, where
it can be assigned to 10-15% of the sequences.
The different geographical distribution of the subclusters in different WHO-regions and in the UK,
the USA, Australia and China are shown in Figure 5. In Figure 6, the evolution of this geographical
distribution broken down into the months of December through part of June is shown, with June
covering only a few days. The subclusters with the most sample counts of up to 10% of the total
data set are cluster ce-0 (approx. 25%), el-0 (25%), er-0 (15%) and ce-A-2 (about 10%). The
remaining 25% of the sequences are distributed among the other 21 subclusters. Cluster ce starts
with subcluster ce-0 in December 2019. In January 2020 emerge subclusters ce-v3, ce-A-v3, st-0,
and st-v8, and in February, ce-A-2, st-3, st-5, mr-0, mr-A-0, mr-B-0, er-0 and el-0. From March
on, the remaining subclusters appeared. Isolates from China can still be found in the subclusters
ce-0, ce-v3, ce-A-v3, st-0, and st-v8. All the other subclusters originated in other regions. Thus,
the first sequence lines described here were created outside China as early as February.
Ce-0, one of the largest subclusters, which contains the fewest variants for reference, is found
particularly strongly in China and Africa (AFR), in about 55% of the samples in those regions, and
is otherwise found in all regions with shares between 20-25%, except in the USA, where it accounts
for only about 10% of all isolates. The smaller fraction in the USA may be due to successful control
measures (12, 13). After starting from China, the virus was already found in January in the WHO
regions WP, SEA, Europe, and AFR, as well as in the USA.
Two subclusters of cluster ce no longer contain sequences that show exposure in China–these are
subclusters ce-1 and ce-A-2. Subcluster ce-1 was first found in March, and 80% of its sequences
are from the WHO region of Europe and from the UK. This subcluster is disproportionately
common in the WHO regions of Europe and the Americas, as well as in the UK. Subcluster ce-A7

2 first appears in February, with the vast majority of sequences being from the UK. Figure 6
illustrates that variant-bearing sequence lines already started appearing in China in January with
subcluster ce-v3 and ce-A-v3, which are the first to contain variant 11083T. The two Europeandominated subclusters ce-1 and ce-A-2 first appeared later in February (ce-A-2) and March (ce-1).
This suggests the conclusion that subcluster ce-v3 consists of precursor sequences of subcluster
ce-1, while subcluster ce-A-v3 consists of precursor sequences of subcluster ce-A-2. Subclusters
ce-1 and ce-A-2 thus represent a combination of variants that have emerged regionally and have
gained regional dominance. In other regions and countries, line ce-v3, which has major shares in
WHO regions WP (30%), SEA (25%), EM (15%), and Australia (10%), may have developed quite
differently.
Subcluster el-0 occurred in February in Europe and developed into a predominantly dominant
phenomenon in the UK during the months of March and April. Subcluster el-0 is also seen in May
and June in the USA, SEA and Africa. Subclusters el-v2 and el-2 first appeared in March with
most sequences coming from the UK. These clusters can thus be seen as further regional
diversification from the precursor subcluster el-0.
As Cluster er is predominantly found in the US, the beginning of Cluster er-0 in February is
remarkable in that it has most of its sequences coming mainly from Europe at that time. The
mutation in cluster er-1 is mainly a phenomenon in the USA.
While the clusters el and er and their associated subclusters already show a strong regional focus,
the picture is much more heterogeneous for the smaller clusters st and mr.
The most heterogeneous distribution in relation to the exposure region show subclusters st-0 and
st-v8. Subcluster st-0 launched in Europe in February and was found in all other WHO-Regions,
mainly USA, Europe, China and SEA. Samples of clusters st-v8 came to a disproportionately high
proportion from the USA, Americas, Australia, China and WP. Notable are subclusters st-3, which
appears mainly in the USA, and st-5, which appears mainly in the UK and Europe. These two
subclusters occurred in February with subcluster st-3 already starting and gaining dominance in
the USA and subcluster st-5 starting in Europe/UK. This may be consistent with results from
Bedford et al (13) mapping GISAID Clade A, which they could assign to a laxly controlled
introduction at the end of January and the beginning of February (13). After only a few months of
the pandemic, st subclusters from Europe/UK already show marked differences from st subclusters
from the USA. This shows that the virus continues to change from its initial sequence, resulting in
regional sequence patterns that are more and more different from each other, as well as having
differences within regions.
The small cluster mr shows a particularly high heterogeneity with 7 subclusters. Four subclusters
appear with a clear predominance in Europe: mr-0 and parallel mr-B-0 in February, and mr-2 and
mr-B-1 in March, with mr-B-1 appearing primarily predominant in the UK. The least variant
sequence mr-0 contains, until June, disproportionately many sequences from outside Europe—
namely, from the Americas, EM and USA; mr-B-0 contains disproportionately many from USA
and Australia. Subclusters mr-2 and mr-B-1, which emerged in March, remain limited to Europe
and the UK until June. The global travel restrictions (15) probably furthered this outcome. Notable
is variant mr-A-0, which occurred first in February outside Europe, mainly in the WHO region of
Americas, EM and USA. The subcluster mr-A-1 occurred later in March with sequences coming
from EM, SEA, UK, and Europe.
Although the GISAID data set under consideration is not representative in terms of submissions
from regions outside Europe and the US, we were able to identify variant patterns that showed an
unusual accumulation for other WHO regions. These regions include countries which have been

particularly hard hit by the pandemic, such as Brazil, India and Iran, which have their own
dynamics in terms of their infection due to different public controls and different demographics
(34–36). These variants can develop into separate sequence lines in these respective regions—this
fact should not fall out of the scope of scientific surveillance.

Conclusion
In this paper, we have described a workflow based on PCA performed on a special numeric
coding of the variant matrix with which very large data sets of SARS-CoV-2 genomes can be
neatly categorized. We defined 21 new variant patterns, some of which could account for
regional effects.
As a method, PCA is significantly more robust when analyzing sequences of questionable quality,
since it does not try to analyze every single variant individually, but instead takes into account the
entire set of variants as a whole. A data quality classification can thus be entered as a sample
property in the metadata set and thus taken into account if, in the case of deeper cluster analyses,
questionable results were obtained for the corresponding sample. In a data set weighted strongly
according to origin and level of sampling, further understanding can still be achieved for underrepresented regions and times.

Our analysis, as well as other recent analyses, have shown a high diversity of SARS-CoV-2
genomes in different countries, reflecting the adaptation processes of the virus to its new hosts and
their environment. Furthermore, the analysis shows how quickly regional differentiations are
already taking place. Some variations may no longer be representative of worldwide phenomena
as they are found in individual countries. It is therefore crucial for future research to determine
under which circumstances what changes take place. In this context, it is particularly important to
have elegant and easy-to-use biomathematical methods to analyze this amount of data in a
meaningful way and to support any public health efforts to coordinate sampling from sequences
from all over the world in open-source databases like GISAID.

Figure 1: Sequence of Plots of a sample set of 20,750 SARS-CoV-2 genomes without ambiguous
counts. A) 2D-Plot of eigenvector values corresponding to the two major eigenvalues as computed
from the PCA1 variant matrix encoding—simply identity vs change from reference. B) 2D-Plot of
eigenvector values corresponding to the two major eigenvalues as computed according to PCA2—
variant-specific encoding of the variant matrix. C) same Plot as B, colored by manual assignment
to cluster center (ce), straight (st), middle right (mr) or extreme left (el). D) 3D-Plot of eigenvector
values corresponding to eigenvalues 1, 2 and 10 according to PCA2—variant-specific encoding of
the variant matrix, colored by manual assignment to cluster center (ce), straight (st), middle right
(mr) or extreme left (el).

Figure 2: Comparison of two 3D-Plots of two large sample sets of SARS-CoV-2 genomes after
using specific numerical recoding of the variant matrix prior to PCA. The coordinates of the
plots are eigenvector values corresponding to eigenvalues 1, 2 and 10 as determined by PCA.
Data points are colored according to marker nucleotide positions determined by variant analysis
of the manually separated clusters—see the legend table for this figure. Matches to Clades and
lineage according to GISAID (30), Nextstrain (29) and Rambault et al (28) are also reported in
the legend. A) Sample set of 20,750 SARS-CoV-2 genomes without ambiguous counts. B)
Sample set of all 46,046 human SARS-CoV-2 genomes downloaded from GISAID with data
status 2020-06-15.
