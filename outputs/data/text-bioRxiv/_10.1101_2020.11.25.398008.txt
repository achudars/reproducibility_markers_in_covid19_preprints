ABSTRACT
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 relies on cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to replicate and spread,
although which RBPs control SARS-CoV-2 infection remains largely unknown. Here, we
employ a multi-omic approach to identify systematically and comprehensively which
cellular and viral RBPs are involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We reveal that the cellular
RNA-bound proteome is remodelled upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, having widespread
effects on RNA metabolic pathways, non-canonical RBPs and antiviral factors. Moreover,
we apply a new method to identify the proteins that directly interact with viral RNA,
uncovering dozens of cellular RBPs and six viral proteins. Amongst them, several
components of the tRNA ligase complex, which we show regulate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Furthermore, we discover that available drugs targeting host RBPs that interact with
SARS-CoV-2 RNA inhibit infection. Collectively, our results uncover a new universe of
host-virus interactions with potential for new antiviral therapies against COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan,
China, probably as a consequence of zoonotic transmission originating from bats (Zhou
et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), and has become a pandemic with more than 51 million infected individuals and more
than 1.2 million deaths worldwide (as of 11/11/2020) (Dong et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2
belongs to the Coronaviridae family, and has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA
genome of approximately 30kb. As is the case with all viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is an
intracellular parasite that relies on host cell resources to replicate and spread. Intensive
efforts have been undertaken to improve our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 interactions
with the host cell, including studies to elucidate the transcriptome and proteome dynamics,
posttranslational modifications and protein-protein interactions taking place in the infected
cell (Banerjee et al., 2020; Bojkova et al., 2020; Bouhaddou et al., 2020; Gordon et al.,
2020; Kim et al., 2020b; Klann et al., 2020; Stukalov et al., 2020).
RNA is central for RNA viruses as it does not only function as a messenger for protein
synthesis but also as a genome. However, viral genomes cannot encode all the proteins

required to mediate, autonomously, all the steps of their lifecycle. Consequently, viruses
hijack cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to promote viral RNA synthesis, translation,
stability and assembly into viral particles, (Dicker et al., 2020; Garcia-Moreno et al., 2018).
In response, the host cell employs specialised RBPs to detect viral RNAs and
intermediates of replication through the recognition of unusual molecular signatures,
including tri-phosphate ends, undermethylated cap and double stranded (ds)RNA (Habjan
and Pichlmair, 2015). Viral RNA sensing by antiviral RBPs triggers the cellular antiviral
state, which leads to the suppression of viral gene expression and the production of
interferons. Cellular RBPs are thus crucial regulators of infection, either promoting or
restricting virus infection (Garcia-Moreno et al., 2018; Habjan and Pichlmair, 2015). To
improve our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2, it is fundamental to elucidate the interactions that
viral RNA establishes with the host cell.
Recently, we employed a comprehensive approach, named comparative RNA
interactome capture (cRIC), to discover how the RNA-bound proteome (RBPome)
responds to the infection with an RNA virus named Sindbis (SINV) (Garcia-Moreno et al.,
2019). Strikingly, the RBPome is pervasively remodelled upon SINV infection, and that
these changes appear to be critical for both the viral lifecycle and the cell’s antiviral
defences (Garcia-Moreno et al., 2019). Interestingly, most of the RBPs that are stimulated
by SINV infection redistribute to the membranous structures when this virus replicates,
known as viral replication factories, where they interact with viral RNA (Garcia-Moreno et
al., 2019). These results suggest that viral RNA is the epicentre of critical interactions with
host cell proteins.
In the last few years, a number of approaches have been developed to identify the cellular
proteins that interact with viral RNA employing protein-RNA crosslinking and specific RNA
capture (Kim et al., 2020a; LaPointe et al., 2018; Ooi et al., 2019; Phillips et al., 2016;
Viktorovskaya et al., 2016). While these studies are important advances towards the
understanding of viral ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), the choice of the crosslinking and RNA
isolation approach leads to distinct depths and specificities. For example, while
formaldehyde is a more efficient crosslinker than ultraviolet light (UV), it also promotes
protein-protein crosslinks allowing the capture of indirect interactions through proteinprotein bridges (Tayri-Wilk et al., 2020). Despite their pros and cons, these studies
discovered from dozens to hundreds of cellular proteins that engage with viral RNA in

infected cells, highlighting that the viral RNA is a hub for complex host-virus interactions
(Kim et al., 2020a; Knoener et al., 2017; LaPointe et al., 2018; Ooi et al., 2019; Phillips et
al., 2016; Viktorovskaya et al., 2016).
In this study, we employ multiple proteome-wide approaches to discover which RBPs are
involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using cRIC we uncover that the repertoire of cellular
RBPs is widely remodelled upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, affecting approximately three
hundred proteins involved in a broad range of RNA metabolic processes, antiviral
defences and other pathways. Moreover, we employed a newly developed approach
named viral RNA interactome capture (vRIC) to comprehensively identify the cellular and
viral proteins that interact with viral RNA. We uncover that SARS-CoV-2 RNPs contain
dozens of cellular RBPs and several viral proteins, many of which lack known roles in
virus infection. For example, we discover that the viral membrane protein (M) and spike
(S) interact with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, suggesting potential roles in viral RNA assembly into
viral particles. Strikingly, we show that inhibition of cellular proteins that interact with viral
RNA using available compounds impairs SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our data
uncover the landscape of protein-RNA interactions that control SARS-CoV-2 infection,
including promising targets for novel antiviral treatments against COVID-19.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The cellular RNA-binding proteome globally responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection
Cellular RBPs are fundamental for viruses, as they can promote or supress infection
(Garcia-Moreno et al., 2019). To elucidate the landscape of active RBPs in SARS-CoV-2
infected cells, we employed cRIC (Garcia-Moreno et al., 2019). In brief, cRIC employs
‘zero distance’, ultraviolet (UV) protein-RNA crosslinking, followed by denaturing lysis,
capture of polyadenylated [poly(A)] RNA with oligo(dT) and quantitative proteomics to
identify the complement of RBPs that engages with RNA under different experimental
conditions (Garcia-Moreno et al., 2019; Perez-Perri et al., 2020; Sysoev et al., 2016). To
determine the optimal time post infection for the cRIC experiments, we performed infection
kinetics in epithelial human lung cancer cells (Calu-3), a widely used cell model for
respiratory viruses. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and infective particles increase over time and peak
at 24 hours post infection (hpi) (Figure 1B-C and S1A). Subsequently cell numbers sharply
decrease at 36 and 48 hpi, suggesting widespread cell death (Figure 1D). We thus chose

two stages of the viral lifecycle: 1) an early timepoint where viral RNA is exponentially
increasing (8 hpi), and 2) a late timepoint where viral RNA and extracellular virions peak
(24 hpi), prior to the induction of cell death.
Once the SARS-CoV-2 infection model was characterised, cRIC was then applied to
SARS-CoV-2 infected (8 and 24 hpi) and uninfected cells (Figure 1A). We identified a total
of 809 proteins; 86% of which are annotated by the gene ontology term ‘RNA-binding’ and
are enriched in well-established RNA-binding domains, resembling previously established
bona fide RBPomes (Figure 1E-F, S1B and Table S1) (Hentze et al., 2018). 70 proteins
displayed changes greater than 2-fold at 8 hpi, although only 5 qualified as statistically
significant (Figure 1G and Table S1). This suggests that early RBP responses are either
subtle or are variable across replicates. Conversely, 335 RBPs were significantly altered
at 24 hpi when compared to uninfected cells. Of these, 176 showed increased and 159
decreased RNA-binding activity (Figure 1G and Table S1). Importantly, SARS-CoV-2regulation affects both classical RBPs harbouring well-established RBDs and unorthodox
RBPs lacking known RBDs (Figure 1F). Moreover, regulated RBPs, and especially those
stimulated by SARS-CoV-2, include proteins annotated by GO terms and KEGG pathways
related to antiviral response and innate immunity (Figure S1C). Together, these results
reveal that SARS-CoV-2 infection initially causes a subtle remodelling of the cellular
RBPome (8 hpi) that becomes pervasive by 24hpi, affecting nearly 47% of the detected
cellular RBPs. Interestingly, cRIC also identified three viral RBPs at 8 hpi and five at 24
hpi (Figure 1G). These include known viral RBPs such as nucleocapsid (NCAP) and the
polyprotein ORF1a/b, as well as proteins previously not known to interact with RNA such
as M, S and ORF9b.
Potential causes for SARS-CoV-2 induced RBPome remodelling
SARS-CoV-2 induces a profound remodelling of the cellular RBPome at 24 hpi. We
hypothesised that differential RBP-RNA interactions can simply be a consequence of
changes in protein abundance, as previously reported for fruit fly embryo development
(Sysoev et al., 2016). To assess this possibility, we analysed the whole cell proteome
(WCP) of SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected cells (Figure S2A and Table S2). For
experimental consistency, we employed the inputs of the cRIC experiments. At 8 hpi, only
69 proteins out of the 4555 quantified exhibited significant changes in abundance, with 29
upregulated and 40 downregulated proteins (Figure 2A, S2B and Table S2). The

proportion of differentially expressed proteins increased to 222 at 24 hpi, with 60
upregulated and 162 downregulated proteins (Figure 2A, S2B and Table S2). As
expected, all viral proteins increased in abundance as infection progressed (Figure 2A).
The WCP analysis covers 82% of the proteins identified by cRIC, providing a broad
overview on RBP levels in infected and uninfected cells. When we compared cRIC and
WCP fold changes, we observed correlation only for viral proteins and a few cellular
proteins, which distributed along the diagonal in the scatter plot (Figure 2B). This reflects
that the association of viral proteins with RNA increases as viral proteins accumulate.
Conversely, changes in cRIC were not matched with similar changes in WCP for most
RBPs (Figure 2B). Lack of correlation unequivocally indicates that protein abundance is
not a global contributing factor to RBP responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.
RNA abundance can also influence the RBPome, as RNA substrate availability can alter
protein-RNA interactions. To test this, we analysed poly(A)-selected RNA sequencing
data from Calu-3 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 24h (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020). As
expected, SARS-CoV-2 causes substantial alterations in the cellular transcriptome, with
5465 RNAs displaying significant fold changes when compared to the uninfected control
(2733 upregulated and 2732 downregulated with p<0.01; Figure 2C and S2C).
Particularly, viral RNAs emerge as dominant poly(A) RNA species in the cell, representing
14-19% of the reads (Figure 2C and D). These results have two major implications: 1) that
viral RNAs become new abundant substrates for cellular RBPs and 2) that they are
captured by oligo(dT) and must thus contribute to the changes observed by cRIC.
Therefore, alterations in cellular mRNA abundance and emergence of the viral RNA are
likely contributors to the remodelling of the RBPome in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.
SARS-CoV-2 proteins are known to affect the dynamics and function of cellular RNPs.
For example, the non-structural protein (NSP)16 binds the pre-catalytic spliceosomal
complex and hampers the splicing reaction, while and NSP1 interacts with the ribosome
and inhibits translation initiation on cellular mRNAs (Banerjee et al., 2020; Schubert et al.,
2020; Thoms et al., 2020). Hence, transcriptome effects in RBP dynamics can be
exacerbated by the alterations that viral proteins induce in the metabolism of cellular RNA.
Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are enriched in protein-RNA interfaces and are
known to regulate RBPs (Arif et al., 2018; Castello et al., 2016). We hypothesise that

SARS-CoV-2 induced PTMs can thus also affect RBP dynamics. To test this possibility
we collected total and SARS-CoV-2 regulated PTMs from available datasets (Bouhaddou
et al., 2020; Klann et al., 2020; Stukalov et al., 2020) and mapped them to cRIC-identified
RBPs. We found that RBPs, on average, possess considerably more PTMs than other
cellular proteins. Of the 335 RBPs regulated by SARS-CoV-2, 123 possessed differential
phosphorylation sites and 62 differential ubiquitination sites (Table S3). Strikingly, these
SARS-CoV-2-regulated PTMs occur more frequently in upregulated RBPs than in
downregulated or unaltered RBPs (Figure 2E), suggesting that PTMs could contribute to
the RBP’s ability to interact with RNA. Indeed, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 modulated
RBPs were more frequently phosphorylated at multiple sites than their unaltered
counterparts (Figure S2E). These results suggest that posttranslational control may also
contribute to the differential RNA-binding activity observed for dozens of RBPs in
response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In summary, the combination of the changes in the transcriptome (Figure 2C-D), the
interference of viral proteins with RNA metabolism (Banerjee et al., 2020), and posttranslational regulation (Figure 2E and Table S3) are likely contributing to the regulation
of RBP activities reported here.
Kinetics of RBP alterations upon SARS-CoV-2 infection
The kinetics of RBP activation and inhibition can be informative for protein complex
dynamics and function. To further characterise the dynamics of RBP after SARS-CoV-2
infection, we clustered proteins based on their cRIC fold changes at 8 and 24 hpi. Our
analysis distinguishes eight RBP response profiles as described in Figure 3A and Table
S4. Clusters 2 and 7 are dominant, with 114 proteins in each group, reflecting that most
RBPs changes are only detected at 24 hpi. By contrast, 70 RBPs exhibited more complex
RNA-binding patterns, distributing across clusters 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8.
SARS-CoV-2 RNAs accumulate throughout the infection, and proteins involved in viral
replication or its suppression may well display similar kinetics. Accordingly, cluster 3 is
comprised of RBPs whose RNA-binding activity increases throughout the infection. Apart
from most viral RBPs, cluster 3 harbours several notable cellular factors that have either
been linked to virus infection or are known to play critical roles in cellular pathways
required for viruses. These include the antiviral protein GEMIN5 (Garcia-Moreno et al.,

2019; Martinez-Salas et al., 2020), the autophagy factor SQSTM1 (p62) (Horos et al.,
2019), the pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation factor CPSF6, a known cofactor of
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (Hilditch and Towers, 2014), and the master
regulator of virus infection PPIA (cyclophilin A) (Dawar et al., 2017).
SQSTM1 (also p62) is a critical component of the autophagy pathway that plays a key
role as a receptor of the autophagy substrates and mediates the interaction with growing
phagophores to form autophagosomes (Buscher et al., 2020). In a recent report, it was
shown that SQSTM1 autophagy receptor activity is blocked by interaction with vault (vt)
RNA 1-1 (Horos et al., 2019). The interaction of SQSTM1 with RNA is mediated by its ZZ
and PB1 domain, and the resulting complex is unable to mediate autophagy. The strong
increase in RNA-binding activity of SQSTM1 upon SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that
autophagy is inhibited by SARS-CoV-2 through this pathway. Interestingly, the vault
complex, which contains vtRNAs, has been reported to reside in close proximity to doublemembrane vesicles, which are the sites of viral RNA replication (Klein et al., 2020).
However, whether the increase in SQSTM1 RNA-binding activity is mediated by vtRNA11, other cellular RNA, or the viral RNA itself requires further investigation.
SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 inhibits protein synthesis by interacting with the ribosome’s mRNA
channel (Banerjee et al., 2020; Schubert et al., 2020; Thoms et al., 2020). To determine
how this inhibitory interaction affects cellular RBPs, we analysed the kinetic profiles of all
proteins annotated by gene ontology (GO) terms related to ‘translation’ and ‘ribosome’.
We observed the presence of several components of the eukaryotic initiation factor (EIF)3,
EIF2S1 (also EIF2α), elongation factors and ribosomal proteins in clusters 4, 6, 7 and 8,
which are comprised of downregulated RBPs (Figure 3A and B, S3A and B and Table
S4). Conversely, the cap- and poly(A)-binding proteins eIF4E and PABPC1, as well as the
other translation initiation factors such as EIF4A1 and EIF4A2, EIF4B and EIF4G1 and
EIF4G3, are present in cluster 2, which is comprised of upregulated RBPs (Figure 3A and
B, and Table S4). These opposed results support a model in which the cap- and poly(A)binding initiation factors can interact with cellular mRNAs but cannot associate with EIF3
and the ribosomal subunit 40S, which agrees with the reported action of NSP1 preventing
40S recruitment to cellular mRNAs (Gehring et al., 2009; Yi et al., 2020).
If this model is correct, it is expected that disrupted translation initiation would increase
the presence of the exon junction complex (EJC) onto cellular mRNAs, as it is removed

during the pioneering round of translation (Gehring et al., 2009; Yi et al., 2020). To test
this hypotheses, we searched for the core components of the EJC in our dataset and
observed that EIF4A3, RBM8A and CASC3 exhibit a higher association with RNA in
SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (also in cluster 2, Figure 3A and B and S3E). Conversely, the
EJC removal factor WIBG (PYM1) (Gehring et al., 2009) is downregulated, further
supporting that co-translational removal of EJCs is impaired in infected cells. Moreover,
the crucial nonsense mediated decay factor UPF1 (cluster 7) is also inhibited upon
infection, which reflects that co-translational quality control is not taking place efficiently.
Collectively, these results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 induced protein synthesis shut off
may cause the accumulation of matured transcripts into a translation-inactive state.
Deposition of EJCs on cellular RNAs is a consequence of the splicing reaction (Yi et al.,
2020). However, a recent study reported that SARS-CoV-2 NSP16 interacts with the U1
and U2 small nuclear (sn)RNAs and disrupt splicing (Banerjee et al., 2020). To assess the
effects of NSP16 in RBP dynamics we examined the cRIC fold changes of all
spliceosome-associated proteins. Surprisingly, the components of the core spliceosomal
complexes showed no significant changes in RNA-binding activity, except for SNRPG that
was substantially upregulated (Figure S3D and Table S1). Conversely, several splicing
factors showed strong changes in RNA-binding activity, including the branch point binding
U2AF2, U2SURP, most serine/arginine (SR)-rich splicing factors (SRSF) and several
HNRNPs (Figure S3D, E and F). Many of these proteins play important roles in exon and
intron definition and in the recruitment of the spliceosome (Ule and Blencowe, 2019),
suggesting potential effects in alternative splicing and splicing efficiency.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 and SINV induced alterations of the RBPome
To determine whether the changes that SARS-CoV-2 induces in the cellular RBPome are
shared with other viruses, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 cRIC data to that of SINV
(Garcia-Moreno et al., 2019). SINV is a positive stranded virus from the alphavirus genus.
As SARS-CoV-2, SINV genome is capped and polyadenylated, although it is substantially
smaller (~11kb vs ~30kb). Moreover, both viruses produce subgenomic RNAs and
replicate in the cytoplasm (Banerjee et al., 2020; Garcia-Moreno et al., 2019). Strikingly,
nearly 40% of the changes in RBP activity observed in SARS-CoV-2 were also present in
the SINV cRIC dataset (Figure 4A-C). This exciting result indicates that even if these
viruses belong to different families and have little or no sequence homology, they cause

similar alterations in the RBPome. These consistent changes were observed in both
upregulated and downregulated RBPs (Figure 4A and B). Several antiviral factors were
noticeable amongst the 93 RBPs showing consistent responses to both viruses, TRIM25,
TRIM56, ZC3HAV1 (also ZAP), DHX36 and GEMIN5 (Figure 4D and S4A). These antiviral
RBPs are upregulated in both datasets, suggesting that they are likely involved in the
antiviral response against both SARS-CoV-2 and SINV (Figure 4D and S4A). TRIM25 is
an E3 ubiquitin ligase whose catalytic activity is triggered by RNA binding (Choudhury et
al., 2017). It interacts with SINV RNA and has a powerful antiviral effect in infection
(Garcia-Moreno et al., 2019). TRIM25 antiviral activity is thought to be mediated by the
ubiquitination of RIGI and ZC3HAV1/ZAP (Gack et al., 2007; Li et al., 2017). While RIGI
was not detected in our analysis, ZC3HAV1/ZAP RNA-binding activity was upregulated in
response to infection (Figure 4D). This suggests that ZC3HAV1/ZAP is potentially the
effector TRIM25 antiviral function in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and SINV. Another
E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIM56, displayed enhanced RNA-binding activity in both SARS-CoV2 and SINV infected cells. We recently described that TRIM56 interacts with SINV RNA
and supresses viral infection (Garcia-Moreno et al., 2019), and our present data indicates
that this may also occur in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. GEMIN5 is an antiviral factor that
interacts with the cap and 5’UTR of SINV RNA and supresses viral mRNA translation
(Garcia-Moreno et al., 2019; Martinez-Salas et al., 2020). Given that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs
are also capped, it is thus plausible that GEMIN5 hampers SARS-CoV-2 gene expression
following a similar mechanism. Other RBPs with prominent roles in virus infection were
consistently upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 and SINV, including PPIA (cyclophilin A),
PA2G4, ZC3H11A, DDX3, and HSP90AB1 (Figure S4B) (Dawar et al., 2017; GarciaMoreno et al., 2019; Valiente-Echeverria et al., 2015; Younis et al., 2018).
Our data also revealed antiviral RBPs that are downregulated by SARS-CoV-2 and, in
several instances, also by SINV. These include the RNA editing enzymes ADAR,
APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G, and the nonsense mediated decay helicase UPF1 (Figure
S4C).
Interestingly, 12% of the proteins exhibited opposite behaviour in the two viral models.
Many of these can be traced back to membraneless organelles such us the paraspeckles
and stress granules. The core paraspeckle components NONO, PSPC1, SFPQ and
MATR3 display opposite trends, being repressed by SINV and stimulated or unaffected

by SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S4D). It is proposed that paraspeckles are critical to sequester
proteins and/or mRNAs to regulate gene expression, although the importance of
paraspeckle proteins in virus infection remains poorly understood and deserve further
consideration (Fox et al., 2018). Similar anticorrelation was observed with the stress
granule proteins G3BP1 and G3BP2 (Figure 4D). Stress granules are protein-RNA
assemblies that play a defensive role against viruses by sequestering viral RNA
(McCormick and Khaperskyy, 2017). Alphaviruses like SINV are known to supress stress
granule formation, and this is accompanied by an increase of G3BP1 and G3BP2 RNAbinding activity (Garcia-Moreno et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2016; Panas et al., 2012; Scholte
et al., 2015). The inhibition of G3BP1 and G3BP2 in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells may thus
reflect an opposite outcome, i.e. lower association with RNA due to the induction of stress
granules.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome
The cRIC method captures both SARS-CoV-2 and cellular mRNAs, which represent 1419% and 84-80% of the eluted RNA, respectively (Figure 2D and S2D). Therefore, it is not
possible to know a priori which of the observed protein-RNA interactions are driven by
viral RNA. To systematically identify the RBPs that interact directly with SARS-CoV-2
RNAs, we applied a newly developed approach that we named viral RNA interactome
capture (vRIC) (Figure 5A and B and S5A) (Kamel et al., In preparation). In brief, SARSCoV-2-infected and uninfected Calu-3 cells are treated with the RNA polymerase II
(RNAPII) specific inhibitor flavopiridol (Fvo), followed by a pulse with the photoactivatable
nucleotide analogue 4-thiouridine (4SU). As viral RNA polymerases are insensitive to Fvo,
temporal inhibition of RNAPII causes 4SU to be predominantly incorporated into nascent
viral RNAs. Cells are then UV irradiated at 365 nm to induce crosslinks between viral RNA
and proteins placed at a ‘zero distance’ from the 4SU molecules. As natural nucleotide
bases do not absorb UV light at 365 nm, protein-RNA crosslinking is restricted to 4SUcontaining viral RNA. Cells are then lysed under denaturing conditions and poly(A)containing RNA is captured with oligo(dT) following a previously designed robust
procedure (Castello et al., 2012). After elution, proteins co-purified with the viral RNA are
analysed by quantitative label free mass spectrometry.
Our control experiments showed that neither Fvo nor 4SU interfered with SARS-CoV-2
replication under the conditions used (Figure 5C). In mock cells, 4SU incorporation

followed by 365nm UV crosslinking and oligo (dT) capture led to the isolation of the steady
state RBPome (Figure S5B-F). However, when 4SU was omitted or Fvo was added, the
amount of proteins co-isolated with RNA was massively reduced in both silver staining
and proteomic analyses (Figure S5B-F). These results show that it is required active
RNAPII in uninfected cells to achieve efficient 4SU-dependent protein-RNA UV
crosslinking. Conversely, when cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2, efficient protein
isolation was observed despite Fvo treatment (Figure 5D-E and S5B-F). These findings
confirm that 4SU incorporation into nascent viral RNAs in presence of Fvo promotes
effective UV protein-RNA crosslinking at 365nm (Figure 5D-E and S5B-F). In agreement,
a principal component analysis revealed that the proteomic datasets derived from
uninfected and SARS-CoV-2 infected cells are clearly distinct (Figure 5D), with a total of
139 RBPs enriched in vRIC eluates from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (SARS-CoV2/4SU/Fvo) over the mock control (M/4SU/Fvo), 107 with 1% false discovery rate (FDR)
and 32 additional proteins with 10% FDR (Figure 5E, Table S5). 89% of the proteins within
the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA interactome are annotated with the GO term ‘RNA binding’ and
are enriched in known RBDs (Figure 5F-G), supporting the capacity of vRIC to identify
bona fide protein-RNA interactions. While 65% of the enriched RBPs harbour known
RBDs, vRIC was also able to identify unorthodox RBPs with unknown RBDs that interact
with SARS-CoV-2 RNAs (Figure 5G and Table S5). The SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome
is enriched in GO terms associated RNA metabolism (RNA splicing, transport, stability,
silencing and translation), antiviral response (e.g. RIGI pathway), cytoplasmic granule
assembly (stress granules and P-bodies), and virus biology (e.g. viral process, dsRNA
binding, IRES-dependent viral RNA translation) (Figure 5H). Notably, 8 and 9 proteins
were annotated by innate immunity related terms in KEGG and GO, respectively (Figure
5I).
To determine to what extent the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome harbours cellular RBPs
that are also present in the RNPs of other viruses, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 vRIC
to a SINV vRIC dataset generated in a parallel study (Kamel et al., In preparation). The
SARS-CoV-2 vRIC dataset is smaller than the SINV counterpart, likely due to the limited
starting material available (Figure S5G). Nevertheless, 60% of the RBPs within the SARSCoV-2 RNA interactome were also present in that of SINV (Figure 5J). These striking
results suggest that viral RNPs may share a larger proportion of cellular factors than

previously anticipated, opening the possibility to target commonly used RBPs in broadspectrum therapeutic approaches.
The cRIC analysis revealed global alterations of the translation machinery, likely due to
the NSP1-induced shut-off of cellular mRNA translation (Figure 3B and S3A-B). To test if
these alterations also apply SARS-CoV-2 RNAs, we examined the translation factors
present in the viral RNP. Most of the proteins involved in the recognition of the cap and
poly(A) tail are identified in SARS-CoV-2 RNP, including EIF4G1, EIF4G3, EIF4A1,
EIF4A2, EIF4B and PABPC1 (Figure 5E and Table S5). However, one of the critical
components is missing: the cap-binding protein EIF4E. While we cannot rule out that this
missing protein is a false negative, other capped RNA viruses such as SINV can initiate
translation without EIF4E, calling for further experiments to discriminate between these
two possibilities (Carrasco et al., 2018). Moreover, several core EIF3 subunits (A, C, D
and G) are highly enriched in the SARS-CoV-2 RNP, revealing that the molecular bridge
connecting the ribosome and the mRNA via interaction with EIF4G (Merrick and Pavitt,
2018) is active in SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs despite the downregulation of several EIF3
subunits in the cRIC analysis (Figure 5E and Table S5). These results suggest that even
though EIF3 subunits C and D have an overall reduced association with RNAs likely due
to NSP1 action on translation, they do interact with SARS-CoV-2 RNA to enable viral
protein synthesis.
cRIC revealed an upregulation of many HNRNPs (Figure S3F). To test if viral RNA is
involved in these alterations, we examined the vRIC dataset. Notably, 10 HNRNPs interact
with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, particularly from the A family (A0, A1, A2B1, A3, C, DL, M, L, Q
[SYNCRIP] and R). Indeed, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that a subpopulation
of HNRNPA1 accumulates in the viral replication factories (labelled with anti-dsRNA),
confirming these results (Figure 5SH). These results suggest that the enhancement of
HRNP RNA-binding activity may be driven by SARS-CoV-2 RNA accumulation.
The cRIC analysis revealed a connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and RNA
granules (Figure 4D and S4D). To determine if such interplay involves the viral RNA, we
searched for known components of RNA granules in the vRIC dataset. Notably, we
noticed the presence of core stress granule components G3BP1 and G3BP2, and their
interacting proteins CAPRIN1, NUFIP2 and USP10 within SARS-CoV-2 RNPs (Figure 5E
and Table S5). These results, together with the observed downregulation of G3BP1 and

G3BP2 RNA-binding activities (Figure 4D and S4E) and the known interaction between
G3BP1 and the viral nucleocapsid (NCAP) (Gordon et al., 2020), reflect an intimate
relationship between stress granules and SARS-CoV-2 RNAs. Additionally, the P-body
components DDX6, LSM14A, PATL1 and the miRNA mediator AGO2, also interact with
SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. Conversely, none of the nuclear paraspeckle proteins were
statistically enriched in the viral RNP, suggesting that their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection,
if any, might be indirect. Collectively, our data shows that SARS-CoV-2 RNA engage with
components of stress granules and P-bodies. The biological relevance of these
interactions deserves further characterisation.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA is post-transcriptionally edited, although the importance of this remains
unknown (Kim et al., 2020b). To get more insights into this phenomenon and its
consequences in the composition of the viral RNP, we searched for all ‘editors’ and
‘readers’ that interact with SARS-CoV-2 RNAs (Table S5). ADAR is downregulated upon
SINV infection (Table S1); however, it is highly enriched in SARS-CoV-2 RNPs (Figure 5E
and Table S5). It catalysed the conversion of adenosines to inosine, which can affect
several aspects of RNA function, including structure, RBP binding sites and coding
sequence, potentially hampering viral replication. The participation of ADAR in SARSCoV-2 infection is underscored by a recent study reporting adenosine deamination in the
SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Di Giorgio et al., 2020). Methyl 6 adenosine (m6A) also plays critical
roles in virus infection and viral RNA is typically enriched with this modification (Tan and
Gao, 2018). This molecular signature is recognised by a family of proteins known as
‘readers’, which regulate RNA fate (Wang et al., 2014). While the readers YTHDF2 and
YTHDF3 are downregulated in the cRIC analyses of both SINV and SARS-CoV-2 infected
cells, YTHDC1 and YTHDC2 are stimulated (Figure 4D and S4F and G). These opposed
results indicate that YTH m6A readers are differentially regulated in response to infection.
Our vRIC analysis shows that YTHDC2 is significantly enriched in the SARS-CoV-2 RNPs
(Figure 5E, Table S5). Taken together, these results support the potential role of YTHDC2,
and perhaps YTHDC1, as mediators of m6A function in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Other noteworthy proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 RNA include five helicases
(DDX1, DDX3X, DDX6, DDX60, DHX57); four chaperones (HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1,
HSPA5 and HSPA8); the actin-interacting proteins SYNE1 and SYNE2; the E3 ubiquitin
ligase MKRN2; the vesicle membrane protein VAT1 that interacts with M, ORF7b (NS7B)

and ORF9b (Gordon et al., 2020); the glycolysis enzyme PKM that is known to moonlight
as an RBP (Castello et al., 2012); the antiviral protein OASL that belongs to a family of
SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility factors (Pairo-Castineira et al., 2020), and three separate
subunits of the protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1CA, PPP1CB, PPP1R3A), amongst others.
Collectively, vRIC shows that SARS-CoV-2 RNA engages with a broad range of cellular
RBPs, including classical and non-canonical RNA binders. This dataset represents a step
forward towards understanding the roles of cellular proteins in the function of SARS-CoV2 RNPs.
Viral proteins that interact with viral and cellular RNA
The cRIC and vRIC data are in full agreement regarding the SARS-CoV-2 proteins that
interact with RNA, even though these two methods employ different crosslinking
chemistries (Castello et al., 2012). Viral RBPs include the polyprotein ORF1a/b, NCAP,
and, surprisingly, M, S and ORF9b (Figure 1E-F, 5E, 6A-B and S6A). To determine which
type of interaction these proteins establish with RNA, we normalised the protein intensity
in vRIC and cRIC by that of the WCP (Figure 6A-B, S6A and Table S6). NCAP and
ORF1a/b displayed the highest UV ‘crosslink-ability’, followed by M, ORF9b and S.
Generally, the efficiency of protein-RNA UV crosslinking depends on several factors,
including 1) the geometry of the protein-RNA interaction and, in particular, the quantity
and quality of the contacts to the nucleotide bases, 2) the physicochemical properties of
the bases and amino acids in close proximity, 3) the duration of the interaction, and 4) the
proportion of the protein that engages in RNA binding. Taking these factors into
consideration, we can suggest that ORF1a/b and NCAP establish optimal and stable
interactions with RNA, while M, ORF9b and, especially, S mediate shorter-lived and/or
geometrically less favourable interactions for crosslinking (e.g. interactions with the
phosphate backbone). However, the high protein sequence coverage and peptide
intensity in both vRIC and cRIC experiments (Figure 6C-E and S6B) strongly support the
possibility that these protein-RNA interactions are not false positives.
ORF1a/b is a polyprotein comprising of 16 mature polypeptides. While the peptides
detected in the WCP mapped uniformly throughout the polyprotein, both cRIC and vRIC
identified peptides clustered only in specific regions (Figure 6C). The first peptide cluster
mapped to NSP1 and was only detected by cRIC (both 8 and 24 hpi). The lack of signal
in vRIC samples strongly indicates that NSP1 does not interact with viral RNA but cellular
15

mRNAs, which are highly enriched in the eluates of the oligo(dT) capture (Figure S2D). It
is well established that NSP1 interacts with the ribosome channel to block cellular mRNA
translation (Banerjee et al., 2020; Schubert et al., 2020; Thoms et al., 2020). However,
how does NSP1 disrupt the translation of cellular mRNAs and not viral RNAs? NSP1’s
interaction with cellular mRNAs could contribute to this discrimination. The second peptide
cluster mapped to NSP9 and is present in both vRIC and cRIC (Figure 6C). The detection
of NSP9 by vRIC agrees well with its known role in viral replication and the wellestablished interaction of its SARS-CoV-1 orthologue with single stranded RNA (Chandel
et al., 2020; Egloff et al., 2004). Whether NSP9 is restricted to viral RNA or can also act
on cellular mRNAs requires further characterisation. The third peptide cluster mapped to
the RNA helicase NSP13, which is critical for SARS-CoV-2 replication (Chen et al., 2020).
Cluster 3 peptides are only detected by vRIC, which supports that NSP13 only interacts
with viral RNA. Together, these data reveal that at least seven viral proteins interact with
RNA in infected cells.
The proteins M and S also reliably and robustly co-purify with RNA upon cRIC and vRIC,
and this is evidenced by several high intensity peptides (Figure 1E-F, 5E, 6A-B, E and
S6B). The most likely scenario in which these proteins could engage with viral RNA is
during virus assembly and within viral particles (Klein et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020). To
determine if M and S have sequences compatible with RNA binding, we used RBDetect,
a software package that employs shrinkage discriminant analysis to predict peptide
segments that interact with RNA. Strikingly, we detected two segments in the intravirion
region of M that share sequence similarities with bona fide RNA-binding sites present in
cellular RBPs (Figure S6C), supporting its observed ability to interact with RNA. Similarly,
the intravirion part of S also harbours a ~15 amino acid motif compatible with RNA binding
(Figure S6C). Both M and S RNA-binding regions are present in both SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV-1, suggesting that the underlying functional sequences are conserved. While
we cannot fully rule out that these interactions with RNA are stochastic due to proteinRNA proximity in the context of the virion, their prominence in the vRIC and cRIC data
suggest that they may play a role in infection (Figure 6C-E and S6B). For example, they
may contribute to the recruitment of viral RNA, or to the budding and/or structural
arrangement of the viral particle. Importantly, a recent report shows that NCAP clusters
form underneath the viral envelope during budding of the viral particles, and this structure
persists in the mature particles (Klein et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020). The observed RNA16

binding activity of S and M may contribute to recruit and/or trap viral RNA underneath the
double membrane at the budding site. Indeed, M is known to recruit NCAP to the budding
sites in SARS-CoV-1 infected cells (Ye et al., 2004). In agreement, cryo-electron
tomography analysis of infected cells revealed that membrane invagination at the budding
site appears to require the presence of NCAP (Klein et al., 2020), implying a potential role
for RNA in the process of particle formation.
The viral protein ORF9b was also consistently identified by both cRIC and vRIC,
supporting that it is a novel RNA-binding protein (Figure 1E-F, 5E and 6A-B). Very little is
known about ORF9b beyond its ability to interfere with interferon responses (Jiang et al.,
2020). To determine if ORF9b also contain sequences compatible with RNA binding, we
used RBDetect (sequence-based software) and, given the availability of a deposited
structure (6Z4U) (Weeks et al., In preparation), we also considered

surface

physicochemical properties (BindUP) (Paz et al., 2016). Both approaches agree that there
is a discrete region in ORF9b that generates a positively charged surface with high
probability to interact with nucleic acids (Figure 6G and S6C and D). Further work is
required to define the role of the RNA-binding activity of ORF9b in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Taken together, our data reveal seven viral proteins harbouring RNA-binding activities,
highlighting M, S, ORF9b and novel viral RBPs.
Functional importance of protein-RNA interactions in SARS-CoV-2 infection
To determine if our study has potential for discovery of new regulators of SARS-CoV-2
infection, we assessed the incidence of vRIC and cRIC identified proteins in genome wide
screens with other viruses. The superset comprises of studies using RNA interference
(RNAi), CRISPR-Cas9, and haploid line screens for 36 viruses, including RNA and DNA
viruses (Table S7). This analysis revealed that cRIC and vRIC identified 47 RBPs that that
frequently occur in functional screenings (>3 studies), causing phenotypes in virus
infection (Figure 7A, B, S7A, Table S7). Moreover, we used an automated PubMed
search pipeline to assess how many RBPs have been robustly linked to virus infection in
the literature. Interestingly, 73 (43.5%) of the RBP upregulated in cRIC, 51 (32.5%) of the
downregulated in cRIC and 67 (51.1%) of the RBPs detected by vRIC were already linked
to virus infection (Figure S7B). Taken together, these results support that our dataset is

rich in known regulators of viral infection, but still contains dozens of new host-virus
interactions awaiting to be tested experimentally.
To determine the biomedical potential of cellular RBPs for COVID-19 treatment, we
compared the subset of RBPs stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection and the subset of
proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 RNA to drug databases (Figure S7C). Importantly,
54 proteins within these datasets have potential inhibitors available (Figure S7C). This
opens new avenues for the discovery of antivirals targeting RBPs. As a proof of principle,
we tested five of these drugs in Calu-3 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 7C and
S7D). Our results show that two of these compounds targeting HSP90 and IGF2BP1
(IMP1) cause a strong inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 protein production, with two additional
drugs targeting ELAVL1 (HuR) and MSI2 causing moderate effects and one compound
targeting PKM having slight effects. Moreover, the inhibitor of PPIA (cyclophilin A)
cyclosporine is being tested in the clinic for the treatment of COVID-19 (Rudnicka et al.,
2020). These results reflect the potential of protein-RNA interactions as targets for antiviral
drugs.
The tRNA ligase complex, a new regulator of SARS-CoV-2 infection
vRIC revealed DDX1, RTCB and FAM98A as components of the SARS-CoV-2 vRNP.
These proteins, together with FAM98B, C14ORF166 (CGI99, CLE) and C2ORF49 (ASW)
form the tRNA ligase complex (tRNA-LC) (Popow et al., 2011). DDX1, RTCB, FAM98A
and FAM98B interact directly with RNA and are regulated by both SARS-CoV-2 and SINV
infection. While DDX1 displayed a continuous increase in RNA-binding activity in the cRIC
experiment, the other proteins follow an early inhibition and late increase pattern (Figure
7D). The tRNA-LC mediates the ligation of two unusual RNA fragments, one displaying a
3´-phosphate or 2’, 3´-cyclic phosphate, and the other a 5´-hydroxyl group. This cleavage
pattern is generated by a limited repertoire of cellular endonucleases, which include the
endoplasmic reticulum resident protein IRE1, which is activated in response to UPR
(Jurkin et al., 2014; Popow et al., 2011). Viruses are known to cause UPR, suggesting
that they should activate the endonuclease IRE1 (Galluzzi et al., 2017). UPR leads to the
tRNA-LC-dependent, cytoplasmic splicing of Xbp1 mRNA, which encodes a critical
transcription factor that coordinates the cellular responses to UPR (Jurkin et al., 2014).

The regulation of the RNA-binding components of the tRNA-LC by SARS-CoV-2 infection
and their presence in viral RNPs strongly suggest their involvement in the viral lifecycle.
To confirm the interaction between the tRNA-LC and SARS-CoV-2 RNA, we performed
an immunofluorescence analysis of infected Calu-3 cells. DDX1, a core component of the
tRNA-LC, concentrates at the cytoplasmic foci where dsRNA accumulates, confirming that
DDX1 engages with SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
To test the relevance of the tRNA-LC in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we generated A549-ACE2
cells with tetracycline inducible expression of shRNAs against DDX1 and FAM98A.
Knocking down of DDX1 led to the depletion of other components of the tRNA-LC,
including the ligase RTCB, FAM98A and, in a lesser, extent CIG-99 (Figure 7F and S7E).
These results support previous observations showing that the stability of the tRNA-LC
relies on presence of the core subunits of the complex (Jurkin et al., 2014). Knock down
of the peripheral member of the tRNA-LC, FAM98A, causes minor, non-significant effects
in the levels of the other components (Figure S7E). Importantly, silencing of DDX1 caused
a strong reduction of intracellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA that correlates with a parallel
reduction of NCAP (Figure 7E-F and S7E). Knockdown of FAM98A led to milder effects
in both viral RNA levels and NCAP accumulation (Figure 7F-G and S7E). Since DDX1 is
a core subunit of the tRNA-LC and FAM98A is a secondary one, these differential effects
are expected. Together, these results reveal that tRNA-LC plays an important role in
SARS-CoV-2, although its precise mechanism of action requires further investigation.
OUTLOOK
We provide a systematic and comprehensive analysis of protein-RNA interactions in
SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. We show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a pervasive
remodelling of the RBPome with more than three hundred RBPs displaying enhanced or
reduced interaction with RNA. These alterations are not due to changes in protein
abundance, but rather due to changes in the cell’s transcriptome and, potentially,
posttranslational control. Importantly, nearly 40% of the RBPs that respond to SARS-CoV2 infection are also regulated by SINV infection, which reflect the existence of prevalent
host RBP-virus interactions that span virus species. Similar work with other viruses and
cell types will reveal the complement of cellular RBPs with broad participation in virus
infection. We also applied a new method to elucidate the composition of SARS-CoV-2
RNPs. Our results reveal dozens of cellular proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 RNAs,

which are promising for the development of new therapeutic approaches. The relevance
and complementarity of our datasets is illustrated by the discovery of the tRNA-LC as key
regulator of SARS-CoV-2. Our work thus paves the way to elucidate the importance of the
tRNA-LC and other RNA metabolic processes in SARS-CoV-2 biology. Our study also
discovers novel viral RNPs, including S, M and ORF9b, opening new angles to investigate
their roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In the future, cRIC and vRIC could be extended to other coronaviruses and other biological
models such as primary cells and organoids. We are hopeful that this work will further
shed light on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and accelerate the discovery of therapies
for COVID 19.

al., 2020) were maintained as above with 10% FBS. To generate inducible knockdown
lines, cells were infected with Lentiviral vectors derived from pLKO-Tet-On (Wiederschain
et al., 2009) with the guide sequence GATGTGGTCTGAAGCTATTAA for DDX1 and
GCACATTCAGTAGCCTTATTT for FAM98A. Lentiviruses were produced by cotransfection of HEK293T cells with pHEF-VSVG (NIH AIDS Research & Reference
reagent program #4693) and psPAX2 (kind gift N. Proudfoot, Oxford, UK). After infection
of A549-Ace2 cells with the lentiviruses, selection was performed with 1 µg/ml. shRNAs
were induced by addition of 1ug/ml doxycycline.
Viruses
Infection of Calu-3 cells for virus growth kinetics, cRIC, vRIC, WCP and drug screen was
performed using isolate hCoV-19/Germany/BavPat1/2020 (European Virology Archives:
026V-03883,

EPI_ISL_406862).

and

immunofluorescence, hCoV-19/England/02/2020 (Public Health England propagated viral
isolate Feb 2020, EPI_ISL_407073) was used.
Virus growth kinetic experiments
1.2 x 105 Calu-3 cells were seeded into each well of a 24-well plate. Cells were infected
24 hours after seeding with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. To
determine infectivity, 50 µl of supernatant from each well was used in plaque assays.
Plaque assays were performed as previously described (Klein et al., 2020). Briefly, 2.5 x
105 Vero cells were seeded into each well of a 24-well plate and cells were inoculated with
10-fold serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 containing supernatants for 1 h at 37°C. After 1h,
viral supernatants were replaced by serum-free MEM (Gibco #11095080, Life
Technologies) containing 0.8% carboxymethylcellulose (Sigma, 11095080). Three days
later, plates were fixed with 6 % formaldehyde for 30 minutes and rinsed with tap water.
Plates were stained with a solution containing 1% crystal violet (Sigma, HT90132-1L) and
10% ethanol for 30 min. After rinsing with tap water, plaques were counted to determine
viral titer.
For intra- and extra-cellular RNA extraction, NucleoSpin RNA extraction kit (MachereyNagel, #740955.50) was used following the manufacturer’s specifications. cDNA
synthesis from the total RNA isolated was achieved using a high-capacity reverse
transcription kit (ThermoFisher, #4368814). cDNA samples were diluted 1:15 and used

for qPCR with the iTaq Universal SYBR green mastermix (Biorad, #1725120). Cycle
threshold values were corrected for PCR efficiency of each primer set and normalized to
the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT) mRNA to determine relative
abundance of viral RNA for each sample (see table S8).
Cell viability assay and determination of infection rate
To establish cell viability and infection rate, 1.2 x 105 Calu-3 cells were seeded into each
well of a 24-well plate onto glass coverslips. Mock-infected and SARS-CoV-2-infected
cells were fixed at the times post infection indicated in the figures with 6% formaldehyde
for 30 min. Cells were washed twice with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Permeabilized samples were incubated
with blocking solution (2% of milk and 0.02% Tween-20 in PBS) for 1 h at room
temperature. Samples were stained with primary antibodies specific to dsRNA (see Table
S8) as well as DAPI (DAPI Fluoromount-G, SouthernBiotech, 0100-20) to visualize the
nuclei using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon, Tokio, Japan). Three replicates per
time point were analyzed. Nuclei were counted with a custom-made macro for the Fiji
software package (Schindelin et al., 2012). Number of nuclei in infected samples were
normalized to the non-infected control counterparts. To determine the infection rate, the
number of infected cells at each time point was determined using the dsRNA fluorescence
signal with Fiji software using a custom macro (Schindelin et al., 2012).
Colorimetric cell-based assay to assess the effects of RBP inhibitors in SARS-CoV2 infection
Calu-3 cells were seeded at 2 x 104 cells per well of 96-well plate. Cells were treated 24
hours later with 2-fold serial dilutions of the indicated compounds in duplicate wells.
Dilutions ranged from 2.5 nM to 50 µM for Ro 08-2750 (TOCRIS, #2272) and the BTYNB
IMP1 inhibitor (Cayman Chemical, #25623), 5 nM to 100 µM for Ganetespib (BIOZOL,
BYT-ORB181166) and MS-444 (Hycultec, HY100685-1mg) and 1,25 nM to 25 µM for the
PKM2 inhibitor - compound 3k (BIOZOL, SEL-S8616)). 2 hours after treatment, cells were
infected with SARS-CoV-2 (BavPat1/2020 strain) at a MOI of 2. At 24 h post infection,
plates were fixed with 6% formaldehyde for 30 min. Cells were then washed twice with
PBS (Phosphate-buffered Saline) and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS.
Permeabilized samples were then incubated with blocking solution (2% of milk and 0.02%

Tween-20 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Blocking solution was replaced with
primary antibodies specific for SARS-CoV NCAP (Table S8) diluted in blocking solution.
Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, washed four times with PBS followed by incubation
with horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in PBS
(containing 0.02% Tween-20) for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed 3 times with PBS. PBS
excess was carefully removed, and wells were developed by adding 50 µl of TMB
Microwell Peroxidase (SeraCare, Cat: 5120-0077) to each well for 5 min followed by 50
µl of 0.5 M of H2SO4 solution to stop the reaction. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm
using a Tecan-Sunrise absorbance microplate reader. Values were normalized to vehicle
(DMSO). In order to assess the effects of the above-mentioned inhibitors on cell viability,
we employed the commercial kit CellTiterGlo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay
(Promega, Cat: G7570) on a Mithras LB 940 plate reader (Berthold Technologies). The
assays were performed following the manufacturer’s instructions in uninfected cells for the
different doses of each compounds. Luminiscence values were normalised to vehicle
(DMSO).
Immunofluorescence
Round #1.5 (diameter 13 mm) coverslips (Thermo Fischer Scientific) were wiped with lintfree tissue soaked in 80% ethanol and washed in 100% ethanol twice for 2 h. 2x105 Calu3 cells were seeded on the dried coverslips and incubated in growth media for 48 hours
prior to the experiment. Cells were infected with 2x10 5 PFU/well (MOI=1) SARS-CoV-2
(hCoV-19/England/02/2020) and incubated for 24 hours. Cells were fixed in 4%
formaldehyde for 30 minutes and washed once with PBS. Cells were permeabilised for 10
min with PBSTx (1x PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100) at room temperature. Next, cells were
washed twice in PBSTw (1x PBS + 0.1% Tween-20) for 5 min each and incubated in
blocking solution (PBSTw + 2.5% goat serum + 2.5% donkey serum) for 1 h at room
temperature. Cells were incubated overnight at 4˚C with primary antibodies diluted in
blocking solution (table S8). Coverslips were then washed three times with PBSTw for 10
min each at room temperature and incubated with secondary antibodies and DAPI (1
µg/ml) diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4˚C. Cells were washed three times with
PBSTw for 10 min each, once in PBS for 10 min, once in milliQ H2O and the coverslips
were mounted on glass slides using Vectashield HardSet mounting medium (Vector
Laboratories #H-1400). Mounted cells were imaged on an Olympus SoRa spinning disc

confocal with Orca Flash4 CMOS camera using 100x silicone oil objective (1.35 NA,
UPLSAPO100XS). Specimens were imaged in at least six different locations per coverslip.
3D-stacked images were taken with voxel size of 80 nm x 80 nm x 200 nm in x:y:z and
images were deconvolved with maximum likelihood algorithm using cellSens (5 iterations,
default PSF, no noise reduction, Olympus). Background subtraction was performed on all
channels using rolling ball subtraction method (radius = 250 px) in ImageJ (National
Institutes of Health). Fluorescence intensity profiles were obtained using ImageJ “Plot
profile” tool across 8 µm regions on 0.4 µm max intensity z-projected images. Voxel
intensities were normalized to maximum intensity value obtained from ‘SARS-CoV-2
infected’ condition.
Comparative RNA interactome capture
Comparative RNA interactome capture (cRIC) was performed based on the previously
described protocol (Castello et al., 2013) with the following alterations: Calu-3 cells were
grown in sets of 3x15 cm dishes with 107 cells/dish. One set of dishes remained uninfected
while a second set was infected with SARS-CoV2 (hCoV-19/Germany/BavPat1/2020) at
a MOI of 1. One of these infected cell sets was incubated for 8 h and the other for 24 h. 3
biological replicates for each condition were performed. After incubation, plates without
lids were placed on ice and cells were irradiated with 150 mJ/cm 2 of UV light at 254 nm
and lysed with 5 mL of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM LiCl, 0.5% LiDS
wt/vol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% IGEPAL (NP-40) and 5 mM DTT). Lysates were homogenized
by passing the lysate at high speed through a 5 mL syringe with a 27G needle, repeating
this process until the lysate was fully homogeneous. Ten percent of the lysate was
separated for total proteome analysis (WCP). The rest of the samples were processed as
follows. Protein content was measured using Qubit protein assay (Invitrogen Q33212) and
lysates were normalized by protein content. 0.45 mL of pre-equilibrated oligo(dT)25
magnetic beads (New England Biolabs, #S1419S) were added to the lysates and
incubated for 1 h at 4°C with gentle rotation. Beads were collected in the magnet and the
lysate was transferred to a new tube and stored at 4°C. Beads were washed once with 5
mL of lysis buffer, followed by two washes with 5 mL of buffer 1 (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5,
500 mM LiCl, 0.1% LiDS wt/vol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% IGEPAL and 5 mM DTT), and two
washes with buffer 2 (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% IGEPAL
and 5 mM DTT), in all cases incubating the beads for 5 min at 4°C with gentle rotation.

Beads were then washed twice with 5 mL of buffer 3 (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM
LiCl, 1 mM EDTA and 5 mM DTT) at room temperature for 3 minutes. Beads were
resuspended in 300 μL of elution buffer and incubated for 3 min at 55°C with agitation.
After collecting the beads with a magnet, eluates (supernatants) were collected and stored
at −80°C. The lysates were subjected to a second round of capture and the eluates from
the first and second cycles were combined. Prior to mass spectrometry sample
processing, samples were RNase treated with ~0.02U RNase A and RNase T1 at 37°C
for 1h.
Viral RNA interactome capture
Viral RNA interactome capture was performed as in (Kamel et al., In preparation). Briefly,
Calu-3 cells were grown in sets of 2x15 cm dishes. For the infected samples (SARSCoV2/4SU/Fvo), at 8hpi (hours post-infection, MOI=1), the growth media were replaced
with fresh media supplemented with (20 µM Flavopiridol hydrochloride hydrate (Fvo,
Cat.No. F3055, Sigma-Aldrich)) and 100 µM 4-Thiouridine (4SU, Cat.No. T4509, SigmaAldrich)). The plates were returned to the incubator for additional 16 hours. At 24hpi,
growth media were discarded, and the cells were rinsed once with PBS (Phosphatebuffered saline). Cells were irradiated twice with at 200 mJ/cm 2 using ultraviolet light
365nm. At this stage, samples were subjected to the standard RNA-interactome capture
described above. For the control uninfected samples (M/4SU/Fvo), cells were treated as
in SARS-CoV-2/4SU/Fvo with exception of not adding the virus. Both M/4SU/Fvo and
SARS-CoV-2/4SU/Fvo were performed in sets of four biological replicates. Additional
controls, (M/4SU/-), uninfected cells were treated as in M/4SU/Fvo, without the addition
of Fvo, and (M/-/-) uninfected cells were incubated with growth media (not supplemented
with Fvo and 4SU) and not crosslinked. Both (M/4SU/-) and (M/-/-) were performed in sets
of three biological replicates.
Mass spectrometry
The cRIC, vRIC and WCP protein samples were processed via the bead-based singlepot, solid-phase-enhanced sample-preparation (SP3) method, using Speed Bead
Magnetic Carboxylate Modified Particles (Sigma-Aldrich, cat.no.45152105050250)
(Hughes et al., 2019). Protein digestion was performed using Trypsin Gold (MS grade;

Promega, cat. no. V5280). Processed peptides were acidified by formic acid (final
concentration 5%) prior to Mass spectrometry analysis.
For cRIC and vRIC peptides, liquid chromatography (LC) was preformed using Ultimate
3000 ultra-HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were initially trapped in C18
PepMap100 pre-column (300 µm inner diameter x 5 mm, 100A, Thermo Fisher Scientific)
in Solvent A (Formic acid 0.1% (v/v), Medronic acid 5 µM). Trapped Peptides were
separated on the analytical column (75 µm inner diameter x 50cm packed with ReproSilPur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 mm, 120 A, Dr. Maisch GmbH) in a 60min 15%–35% [vol/vol]
acetonitrile gradient with constant 200 nL/min flow rate. Eluted peptides were directly
electrosprayed into a QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mass
spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap (scan range 350-1500 m/z, resolution 70000, AGC
target 3 x 106, maximum injection time 50 ms) in a data-dependent mode. the top 10 most
abundant peaks were fragmented using CID (resolution 17500, AGC target 5 x10 4,
maximum injection time 120 ms) with first fixed mass at 180 m/z.
Both WCP and vRIC peptides were analysed using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC
nanoUPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA, USA) system online with an
Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA, USA).
Peptides were loaded onto a trap-column (Thermo Scientific PepMap 100 C18, 5 μm
particle size, 100A pore size, 300 μm i.d. x 5mm length) and separation of peptides was
performed by C18 reverse-phase chromatography at a flow rate of 300 nL/min and a
reverse-phase nano Easy-Spray column (Thermo Scientific PepMap C18, 2μm particle
size, 100A pore size, 75μm i.d. x 50cm). WCP peptides were acquired in a 120 min run
while vRIC samples in an 82 min run. Analytical chromatography for WCP peptides
consisted of Buffer A (0.1% formic acid in HPLC-grade water) and Buffer B (80% ACN,
0.1% formic acid). 0-3 min at 2% buffer B, 3-90 min linear gradient 2% to 40% buffer B,
90-90.3 min linear gradient 40% to 90% buffer B, 90.3-95 min at 90% buffer B, 95-95.3
min linear gradient 90% to 2% buffer B and 95.3-120 min at 2% buffer B. Analytical
chromatography for vRIC peptides was Buffer A (HPLC H 2O, 0.1% formic acid) and Buffer
B (80% ACN, 0.1% formic acid). 0-3 min at 3.8% buffer B, 3-63 min non-linear gradient
3.8% to 40% buffer B, 63-63.3 min linear gradient 40% to 90% buffer B, 63.3-68 min at
90% buffer B, 68-68.3 min non-linear gradient 90% to 3.8% buffer B and 68.3-82 min at
3.8% buffer B. All m/z values of eluting peptide ions were measured in an Orbitrap mass

analyzer, set at a resolution of 120 000 and were scanned between m/z 380-1500 Da.
Data dependent MS/MS scans (3 second duty cycle time) were employed to automatically
isolate and fragment precursor ions using Collisional-induced Dissociation (CID)
(Normalised Collision Energy of 35%). Only precursors with charge between 2 to 7 were
selected for fragmentation, with an AGC target and maximum accumulation time of 1×104
and 125 ms respectively. Precursor isolation was performed by the quadrupole with 1.2
m/z transmission window. MS2 fragments were measured with the Ion Trap analyser.
Dynamic exclusion window was set to 70 seconds.
Protein identification and quantification were performed using Andromeda search engine
implemented in MaxQuant (1.6.3.4) (Cox 2011) under default parameters (Cox et al.,
2011). Peptides were searched against reference Uniport datasets: human proteome
(Uniprot_id: UP000005640, downloaded Nov2016) and SARS-CoV-2 (Uniprot_id:
UP000464024, downloaded 24June2020). False discovery rate (FDR) was set at 1% for
both peptide and protein identification. For cRIC and WCP samples, MaxQuant search
was performed with “match between run” activated. For vRIC samples, since each sample
was analyzed on both Eclipse and QExactive mass spectrometers, raw spectra form both
runs were combined as separate fractions in the MaxQuant search (the spectra from the
Eclipse was assigned fraction 1 and the spectra from the QExactive is assigned fraction
5, and each sample was as independent experiment).
Proteomic quantitative analysis
For relative quantification, MaxQuant outputs (proteinGroups) were used for downstream
analysis. Proteins flagged as potential contaminants were filtered out, using R-package
“DEP (1.4.1)”, together with proteins with all missing values. In case of cRIC and WCP
experiments, proteins raw intensities were normalized and transformed using R-package
Variance Stabilizing Normalization “VSN (3.50.0)”. Correlation analysis between
replicates was preformed using R-package “PerformanceAnalytics (v2.0.4)”. Missing
value imputation was only preformed for proteins with missing values in all replicates in
one experimental condition, while present in the other condition (at least in 2 out of 3
replicates). Imputation was preformed using local (by sample) minimum determination
method (Mindet) (Lazar et al., 2016). Statistical analysis for the processed intensities was
performed in R-package “limma (3.38.3)” using empirical Bayesian method moderated ttest. P values were adjusted for multiple-testing using Benjamini-Hochberg method. For

the vRIC experiments, samples were processed as described above with exception of the
normalization step.
Clustering of cRIC responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection
Cellular RBP responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection was classified into initial response,
which is defined as cRIC log fold change from mock to early time point post-infection (8
hpi/mock), and progressive response, which is determined by log fold change from early
to late time point post-infection (8 hpi/24 hpi). Protein abundance fold changes in these
two stages were visualised using a scatter plot. The RNA-binding activities of cellular
RBPs were divided into 8 clusters based on their initial response, progressive response,
and FDR. Clustering was based on an FDR<10% with a log(2) fold change of 0.5 as
thresholds. For clustering of spliceosome/ spliceosome–related proteins, list of different
classes of spliceosomal proteins obtained from Spliceosomedb.
SARS-CoV-2 proteins RNA binding prediction
RNA binding prediction for regions on the viral protein sequence was performed with
RBDetect. RBDetect is a machine learning model trained by Shrinkage Discriminant
Analysis (SDA) with a dataset of 8891 experimentally identified polypeptides from the
RBDmap experiment, using positive examples (RNA-bound polypeptides) and negative
examples (RNA released polypeptides) (Castello et al., 2016). For each amino acid
position on the viral protein sequence, RBDetect assigns a probability value to bind RNA
based on the fragment centered at that position. Then, a Hidden Markov model is used to
visualize the probabilities in a sequential manner, which helps to determine the most
probable binding regions on a larger scale.
Analysis of the PTM profile of RBPs identified in cRIC
Cellular RBPs detected in cRIC experiments were cross-referenced to phosphorylation
and ubiquitination sites of recent large scale (post-translation modification) PTM
quantification experiments preformed in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. PTM datasets
obtained from the single-timepoint phospho-proteome work by (Klann et al., 2020), multitimepoints phospho-proteome work by (Bouhaddou et al., 2020), and multi-level omics
work by (Stukalov et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 regulated RBPome is defined as RBPs
with FDR < 0.1 in the cRIC experiment. SARS-CoV-2 regulated PTM sites are significant

hits in each data sources using the criteria defined in the corresponding publications. For
the multi-timepoint dataset, a PTM site is considered SARS-CoV-2 regulated, if it is
determined as significant at any timepoint. Fisher’s exact test was employed to calculate
odds ratios and significance of enrichment of each PTM annotation in the SARS-CoV-2
upregulated RBPome versus downregulated RBPome.
Drug-protein interactions
Cellular RBPs (stimulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (from cRIC) or bound to viral RNA
(from vRIC)) were examined for known chemical compound interactions through the DrugGene Interaction database (DGIdb, downloaded Oct-2020).
Gene Ontology (GO) terms
Using the GO annotation available via the GO.db R package (3.11.4), GO terms including
the term 'RNA binding' (to annotate RNA-binding related functions, processes, or
compartments) or term 'immun' or exact terms 'immune response' and 'innate immune
response' (to annotate immunity related functions, processes, or compartments) were
selected. The full list of terms is provided as a supplementary table (Table S9). The R
package org.Hs.eg.db (3.11.4) was used to identify the genes (proteins) in our dataset
that are annotated to these GO terms using the cross-database id mapping functionality.
GO enrichment analysis was performed using PANTHER classification system
(http://www.pantherdb.org).
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways
KEGG pathways under the 'Immune system' category in the high-level KEGG hierarchy
available via the R package “KEGGREST” (1.28.0) were selected (see tableS9) and
genes mapping to these pathways were identified using “org.Hs.eg.db.”
Pfam RNA-binding domains
Classification of proteins into classical and non-classical RNA-binding proteins is based
on their Pfam domain composition. We considered RRM, KH, DSRM, Piwi, DEAD, PUF,
CSD, and zf-CCCH domains as classical. These were obtained from the PFAM.db R
package (3.11.4). Furthermore, we considered as non-classical RNA-binding domains
those Pfam-A domains robustly identified as RNA-binding by RBDmap with at least 3

peptides and RNA interactome capture (Castello et al., 2012; Castello et al., 2016). The
classification is provided in Table S9. The proteins containing these domains were
identified using org.Hs.eg.db.
PubMed literature linking genes to viral infections
To automatically query the NCBI Entrez Utilities REST API, the R package “rentrez”
(1.2.2) was used. For each gene symbol in our dataset the number of PubMed articles
matching with a search query “(SYMBOL) AND (virus)” where SYMBOL is the gene name,
such as EIF4E were retrieved. A minimum of five search results was considered a
substantiated indication of a gene having a connection to virus-related literature.
RNA sequencing analysis
Strand-specific, poly(A) RNA-seq corresponding to SARS2-infected (MOI=2) Calu-3 cells
and controls from published work (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020) were downloaded from the
Sequence Read Archive using “SRA toolkit “(2.10.8). Specifically, we analysed the
following samples: Calu3 Mock 1 (GEO GSM4462348, SRA series SRX8089276, SRA

was performed via “STAR aligner” (2.7.3a), with splicing-aware settings, against human
reference genome (GRCh38.99) and SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2). Only uniquely aligned
reads were used for downstream analyses. Mapped reads (exonic regions) counting was
performed by “htseq-count” (0.11.3) in a strand-specific fashion. In order to assess the
main driver(s) of variations across the RNA-seq samples, we performed a principal
component analysis (PCA). First, we performed library size correction and variance
stabilisation with regularized–logarithm transformation implemented in “DESeq2” (1.28.1).
This corrects for the fact that in RNA-seq data, variance grows with the mean and
therefore, without suitable correction, only the most highly expressed genes drive the
clustering. The 500 genes showing the highest variance were used to perform PCA using
the “prcomp” function implemented in the base R package “stats” (4.0.2). Finally,

differential expression analysis was performed using the R package “DESeq2” (1.28.1).
“DESeq2” estimates variance-mean dependence in count data from high-throughput
sequencing data and tests for differential expression based on a model using the negative
binomial distribution.
Data wrangling and visualisation
The “tidyverse suite” (1.3.0) was used for data wrangling in R, and “rtracklayer” (1.48.0)
for manipulating gtf annotation files. Furthermore, we used the following R packages in
creating the presented visualisation: “ggplot2” (3.3.2), “viridis” (0.5.1), “ggrepel” (0.8.2),
“scales” (1.1.1).

Figure 1. RBPome analysis in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. A) Schematic representation of cRIC and its application to SARS-CoV-2
infected cells. B) Proportion of infected cells estimated by immunofluorescence using an antibody against dsRNA. C) RT-qPCR analysis
of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cells and isolated from the supernatant of infected cells. Samples were collected at the indicated times post
infection. D) Number of adhered cells at different times post SARS-CoV-2 infection counted using DAPI stain. Error bars in B, C and D
represent the standard error of the mean (SEM) of three independent experiments. E) Proportion of the identified RBPs that are annotated by the gene ontology (GO) term ‘RNA-binding’. F) Proportion of identified RBPs that harbour known RBDs or lack domains linked to
RNA binding. The definition of known RBDs is taken from Garcia-Moreno et al, 2018. G) Volcano plots showing the log2 fold change (x
axis) and its significance (adj. p-value, y axis) of each protein (dots) in the cRIC experiments. Fold changes are generated as the ratio
between the protein intensity at 8 hpi and in uninfected cells (left) or at 24 hpi and in uninfected cells (right), using data from three biological replicates. Red and dark blue proteins represent RBP upregulated or downregulated, respectively, with 1% false discovery rate
(FDR), while orange and cyan represent proteins enriched with 10% FDR.

Figure 2. Factors influencing RBP remodelling in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. A) Proteomic analysis of the inputs of the cRIC experiment corresponding to the whole cell proteome. Volcano plots showing the log2 fold change (x axis) and its significance (adj. p-value, y
axis) of each protein between 8 hpi and uninfected conditions (left) or 24 hpi and uninfected conditions (right) using data from three biological replicates. Red and dark blue proteins represent RBP upregulated or downregulated with 1% FDR, while orange and cyan represent
proteins enriched with 10% FDR. B) Scatter plot showing the fold changes between 24 hpi and uninfected cell in cRIC (y axis) and the
WCP (x axis) for corresponding proteins. In red and blue are the RBPs upregulated or downregulated in the cRIC experiment (FDR<10%)
(Figure 1G). C) MA plot highlighting significant changes in gene expression in SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 cells as detected by RNA
sequencing. 2733 and 2732 genes are up- and down-regulated, respectively (p-adjusted < 0.01). D) Fraction of uniquely aligned RNA-seq
reads mapping to human chromosomes or SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA in uninfected and infected cells. E) Bar plot showing the odds ratio
of previously reported total and SARS-CoV-2 differentially regulated posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in upregulated and downregulated RBPs, relative to the non-regulated RBPs within the cRIC experiment. *, p<0.1; **, p<0.05; ***, p<0.01.

Figure 4. Analysis of RBP dynamics in SARS-CoV-2 and SINV infected cells. A) Scatter plot of the fold change between infected
and uninfected cells, using the data from the cRIC experiments in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (Figure 1G) and in SINV-infected cells
(Garcia-Moreno et al., 2019). We used the late time post infection in both experiments, which corresponds to 24 hpi for SARS-CoV-2
and 18 hpi for SINV. Proteins were grouped based on their behaviour (B) and the overlap between datasets was estimated (C). D) Fold
change of selected proteins in SARS-CoV-2 (red) and SINV (blue) cRIC analyses. ‘Early’ represents 8 hpi for SARS-CoV-2 and 4 hpi
for SINV. ‘Late’ is 24 hpi for SARS-CoV-2 and 18 hpi for SINV *, FDR < 20% ; **, FDR < 10% and *** FDR < 1%.

RT-qPCR. D) Principal component analysis (PCA) of the four vRIC replicates, including samples from infected (SARS-CoV-2/4SU/Fvo)
and mock (M/4SU/Fvo) cells. E) Volcano plots showing the log2 fold change (x axis) and significance (adj. p-value, y axis) of each
protein in the vRIC experiment. Fold changes are estimated as the ratio between the protein intensity in eluates from infected
(SARS-CoV-2/4SU/Fvo) and mock (M/4SU/Fvo) samples using data from four biological replicates. Red dots represent proteins
enriched in samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells at 1% FDR, while orange represents proteins enriched with 10% FDR. F) Proportion of the proteins enriched in the SARS-CoV-2 RNPs that are annotated as ‘RNA-binding’ in gene ontology (GO). G) Proportion of the
proteins enriched in the SARS-CoV-2 RNPs that harbour known RBDs or lack domains linked to RNA binding. H) GO enrichment analysis of the proteins enriched in the SARS-CoV-2 RNPs. I) Proportion of the proteins enriched in SARS-CoV-2 RNPs that are annotated

using the vRIC data from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (Figure 1G) and SINV-infected cells (Kamel et al., in preparation). In the right, box
plot showing the overlapping between the two datasets.

Figure 6. SARS-CoV-2 proteins that interact with RNA. A and B) Representative scatter plot showing the cRIC (left, 24 hpi/mock))
or vRIC (right, infected/uninfected) fold change normalised to the fold change in the WCP (24 hpi/mock). Replicates 1 and 2 were
chosen as illustrative examples and the rest of comparisons can be found in Figure S6A. Cellular RBPs upregulated in the cRIC experiments (Figure 1G) are coloured in yellow, cellular RBPs enriched in SARS-CoV-2 vRIC (Figure 5E) are shown in violet, and viral
proteins in red. C and D) Sequence coverage analysis. Peptides detected in WCP (blue), cRIC (green) and vRIC (violet) are mapped
to the viral proteins plotted from N-terminus to C-terminus (x axis). E) Boxplot showing peptide intensity distribution in cRIC, vRIC and
WCP for each of the viral proteins detected. Colours as in C-D. G) ORF9b structure showing the protein surface (PDB ID: 6z4u).
Peptides with high probability of RNA binding by RBDetect (left) or BindUP (right) are coloured in blue.

Figure 7. Functional characterisation of protein-RNA interactions in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. A-B) Proteins with identified
phenotypes in genome-wide screens using viruses. RBPs enriched in SARS-CoV-2 vRIC (A) or upregulated in the cRIC experiment
(B) are displayed along the x axis, while y axis indicates the number of screens in which the protein has caused a phenotype in
infection. C) Effects of RBP inhibitors on SARS-Cov-2 infection. Red line indicates the effects in infection measured by protein
ELISA at each drug dose. Black line shows cell viability at each drug dose. Error bars are SEM from three independent experiments. D) RNA binding profiles of the components of the tRNA ligase complex in SARS-CoV-2 (red) and SINV (blue) infected cells
(As in Figure 4D) *, FDR < 20% ; **, FDR < 10% and *** FDR < 1%. E) Confocal immunofluorescence images of SARS-CoV-2 and
mock-infected Calu-3 cells using antibodies against DDX1 and dsRNA. Fluorescence plot shows green and red fluorescence intensity profiles across an 8 µm section (white line). F) Western blot analysis showing the nucleocapsid (NCAP), components of the
TLRC complex and β-actin (ACTB) levels in control cells and upon DDX1 or FAM98A knock down. G) SARS-Cov-2 RNA levels in
control cells and upon DDX1 or FAM98A knock down measured by RT-qPCR and normalised to β-actin mRNA. Error bars are SEM
from three independent experiments.

Figure S5. vRIC analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. A) Schematic representation of all the controls used in the vRIC experiment. B) Silver staining analysis of the inhibitory effect of Fvo in the incorporation of 4SU into poly(A) RNA in Hek293 cells. Uninfected
cells were treated with or without fvo and with or without 4SU and irradiated with 365 nm UV light. RBPs bound to poly(A) RNA were
isolated by RIC and eluates analysed by silver staining. Fvo strongly reduces the purification of RBPs by oligo(dT) capture suggesting
lack of incorporation of 4SU into nascent RNAs. C) Scatter plots comparing protein intensity correlation between vRIC replicates for
each condition. Pearson correlation is indicated. ***, p<0.001. D) Kernel density plot for the different vRIC samples showing the
distribution of mean protein intensities. E) Protein intensity distribution in samples and controls of the vRIC experiment. P value is
estimated by Welch's t-test F) Correlation of protein intensity in the vRIC experiment when comparing infected vs uninfected cells and
uninfected cells treated or not with Fvo. G) Venn diagram showing the overlapping between SARS-CoV-2 and SINV vRIC datasets.
H) Immunofluorescence analysis using antibodies against HNRNPA1 and dsRNA in uninfected and infected cells. Right plot shows
the distribution of fluorescence intensity in the green and red channels across the lines depicted in the image. AFU, arbitrary fluorescence units.

Figure S6. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that interact with RNA. A) Scatter plot showing the correlation between replicates
of the protein intensity ratio between cRIC and WCP (upper panels) or vRIC and WCP (bottom panels). B) Peptide intensity
distribution for all the viral proteins in WCP, cRIC or vRIC at 24hpi. C) Prediction of putative RNA-binding sites within the
SARS-CoV-2 (left) and SARS-CoV-1 intravirion part of S (upper panels) and M (middle panels) or full length ORF9B (bottom
panels). Prediction was made with RBDetect, which employs shrinkage discriminant analysis in the positive and negative examples
within the RBDmap dataset to predict RNA-binding sites based on sequence similarities with human RBPs. D) Visualisation of the
electrostatic surface of ORF9b using an available 3D structure (PDB ID: 6z4u). In blue are displayed the positively charged
surfaces, while the negatively charged ones are shown in red.

Figure S7. Functional implications of RBPs in SARS-CoV-2 infection. A)
Proteins with identified phenotypes in genome-wide screens using viruses.
Proteins dowregulated in the cRIC experiment are displayed along the x axis,
while y axis indicates the number of screens in which the protein has caused
a phenotype in infection. B) Proportion of proteins within the cRIC and vRIC
datasets that have been linked to infection using Pudmed automatized analysis. C) Comparison of RBPs upregulated by cRIC or/and present in the vRIC
dataset to drug databases. D) Effect of PKM2 inhibitor on SARS-Cov-2
infection. Red line indicates the effects in infection measured by protein ELISA
at each drug dose. Black line shows cell viability at each drug dose. Error bars
are SEM from three independent experiments. E) Effects of DDX1 and
FAM98A knock down in the tRNA-LC subunits and SARS-CoV-2 NCAP. Data
is normalised to wild type cells. Error bars represent standard deviation using
information from three biological replicates. *, p< 0.05; **, p<0.01 and ***
