Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that has resulted in a global pandemic. It is a highly
contagious positive strand RNA virus and its clinical presentation includes severe to
critical respiratory disease that appears to be fatal in ~3-5% of the cases. The viral
spike (S) coat protein engages the human angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) cell
surface protein to invade the host cell. The SARS-CoV-2 S-protein has acquired
mutations that increase its affinity to human ACE2 by ~10-15-fold compared to SARSCoV S-protein, making it highly infectious. In this study, we assessed if ACE2
polymorphisms might alter host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 by affecting the ACE2 Sprotein interaction. Our comprehensive analysis of several large genomic datasets that
included over 290,000 samples representing >400 population groups identified multiple
ACE2 protein-altering variants, some of which mapped to the S-protein-interacting
ACE2 surface. Using recently reported structural data and a recent S-proteininteracting synthetic mutant map of ACE2, we have identified natural ACE2 variants that
are predicted to alter the virus-host interaction and thereby potentially alter host
susceptibility. In particular, human ACE2 variants S19P, I21V, E23K, K26R, T27A,
N64K, T92I, Q102P and H378R are predicted to increase susceptibility. The T92I
variant, part of a consensus NxS/T N-glycosylation motif, confirmed the role of N90
glycosylation in immunity from non-human CoVs. Other ACE2 variants K31R, N33I,
H34R, E35K, E37K, D38V, Y50F, N51S, M62V, K68E, F72V, Y83H, G326E, G352V,
D355N, Q388L and D509Y are putative protective variants predicted to show decreased
binding to SARS-CoV-2 S-protein. Overall, ACE2 variants are rare, consistent with the
lack of selection pressure given the recent history of SARS-CoV epidemics, however,
are likely to play an important role in altering susceptibility to CoVs.

Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are widely distributed in nature and pose a serious threat to
humans and a range of mammalian hosts causing respiratory, gastrointestinal, and
central nervous system diseases (Li, 2016). CoVs are enveloped non-segmented
positive-sense single stranded RNA viruses and are classified into α−, β−, γ−, and δCoVs (Li, 2016). While α- and β-CoVs infect mammals, the γ- and δ-CoVs generally
infect birds (Li, 2016). Previously, α-CoVs HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, and β-CoVs
HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 have been found to infect humans leading to mild
symptoms (Graham and Baric, 2010; Li, 2016). However, three β-CoVs, severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 (Holmes, 2003; Li, 2016),
Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2012 (MERS-CoV) (Li, 2016; Zaki et
al., 2012), and more recently SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 (Chan et al., 2020; Huang et al.,
2020; Zhu et al., 2020), have crossed species barrier to infect humans resulting in
respiratory illnesses including pneumonia that is fatal.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) first reported in December
2019 and is the cause of an ongoing global pandemic (Chan et al., 2020; Huang et al.,
2020; Zhu et al., 2020). It has infected over 1.2 million people in 181 countries leading
to over 69,000 deaths as of April 5th, 2020 (JHU, 2020). SARS-CoV-2 genome
sequence analysis revealed that it is closer to bat CoV RaTG13 (96.2% identical) than
to SARS-CoV (79.5% identical) responsible for the 2003 epidemic, suggesting that this
novel virus originated in bats independently before jumping to humans either directly or
through an yet to be determined intermediary host (Guo et al., 2020).
As with SARS-CoV and a related alpha-coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), SARSCoV-2 employs the human ACE2 cell surface protein as a receptor to gain entry into
cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Letko et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2008; Ou et al., 2020; Wan et
al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a). The virus surface spike glycoprotein (S-protein)
constitutes a key determinant of viral host range and contains two domains, S1 and S2,
which are separated by a protease cleavage site (Li, 2016). A successful host cell
invasion by the virus involves direct binding of the virus S1 receptor binding domain
(RBD) to the host ACE2 peptidase extracellular domain (PD), exposing the S1-S2 interdomain protease site that upon cleavage by host proteases leads to S2-mediated virus-

host cell membrane fusion (Belouzard et al., 2009; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Li, 2016; Li et
al., 2005a; Simmons et al., 2005).
The SARS-CoV-2 S-protein is 98% identical to the bat CoV RaTG13 S protein,
with the exception of an insertion that is also absent in the SARS-CoV S-protein in the
S1/S2 inter-domain protease cleavage site. This difference has been proposed to alter
SARS-CoV-2 tropism and enhance its transmissibility (Walls et al., 2020).
Several structural studies involving the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein RBD and ACE2
PD have identified key residues involved in their interaction (Shang et al., 2020; Walls et
al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). The S-protein RBD was reported to
bind ACE2 PD with ~10- to 20-fold higher affinity (~15 nM) when compared to the
SARS-CoV S-protein RBD (Shang et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020), potentially
contributing to high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
As the interactions between the ACE2 receptor and S-protein RBD interface are
critical for the cellular entry of the virus, we wondered if there were natural ACE2
variations that decrease or increase its affinity to the S-protein RBD that may protect or
render individuals more susceptible to the virus. Consistent with this possibility, a
saturation mutagenesis screen of select ACE2 PD residues identified variants that
showed enhanced or decreased binding to S-protein (Procko, 2020).
In this study, we have analyzed ACE2 protein-altering variants in a large cohort
of human population groups and identified polymorphisms that either likely protect or
render individuals more susceptible to the virus. Understanding these changes at the
molecular level, combined with the genotype and epidemiological data will allow the
elucidation of population risk profiles and also help advance therapeutics such as a
rationally designed soluble ACE2 receptor for treatment of COVID-19.

Wrapp et al., 2020). It is very likely that there are natural variations in ACE2 in human
populations, though not under selection, that may increase or decrease its affinity to
SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and thereby render individuals more resistant or susceptible to
the virus. To investigate this, we assessed ACE2 protein-altering variations from a
number of databases including the gnomAD (Karczewski et al., 2019), RotterdamStudy
(Ikram et al., 2017), ALSPAC (Fraser et al., 2013) and Asian-specific databases which
included GenomeAsia100k (GenomeAsia, 2019), HGDP (Bergstrom et al., 2020),
TOMMO-3.5kjpnv2 (Tadaka et al., 2019), and IndiGen (https://indigen.igib.in/), and
HGDP (Bergstrom et al., 2020) (Supplementary Table 1). We found a total of 298
unique protein altering variants across 256 codons distributed throughout the 805 amino
acid long human ACE2 (Figure 1a, 1b, Supplementary Figure 1, and Supplementary
Table 1). The most frequent variant, N720D (1.6% allele frequency; n=3054, gnomAD),
was found in the C-terminal collectrin domain that is not involved in the SARS-CoV-2 Sprotein interaction. Overall, we found human ACE2 receptor polymorphisms to be low
with a weighted mean Fst (fixation index) value of 0.0168, and the ACE2 PD showed
even more reduced variation (Wilcoxon p=0.0656, Supplementary Figure 2a, see
Methods). Further, we found ACE2 to be highly intolerant of loss of function variants
(pLI=0.9977, gnomAD; Supplementary Figure 2b, see Methods), though we observed
5 predicted LOF singleton alleles (Supplementary Table 1).
Structural studies involving SARS-CoV and, more recently, the SARS-CoV-2 Sprotein and its complex with human ACE2 have identified three regions in an ~120
amino acid claw-like exposed outer surface of the human ACE2 (ACE2-claw) that
contributes to its binding to the S-protein (Shang et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp
et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). The main residues at the interface include S19, Q24,
T27, F28, D30, K31, H34, E35, E37, D38, Y41, Q42, L45, L79, M82, Y83, T324, Q325,
G326, E329, N330, K353, G354, D355, R357, P389, and R393 (Figure 1b).
Mutagenesis of four residues in the S-protein-binding interface of rat ACE2 was
sufficient to convert rat ACE2 into a human SARS-CoV receptor, further indicating the
importance of this region in determining the host range and specificity of CoVs (Li et al.,
2005b). Considering these findings, we focused on variants within the human ACE2claw S-protein RBD-binding interface and identified protein alterations in 44 codons that

resulted in 49 unique variants for a total of 968 allelic variants. This included K26R, the
second most frequent human ACE2 protein-altering variant (0.4% allele frequency;
allele count=797, gnomAD), S19P, T27A, K31R, N33I, H34R, E35K, E37K, D38V,
N51S, N64K, K68E, F72V, T921, Q102P, G326E, G352V, D355N, H378R, Q388L, and
D509Y (Supplementary Table 2). These variants are likely to either increase or
decrease the binding affinity of ACE2 to the S-protein and thereby alter the ability of the
virus to infect the host cell.
A recent mutagenesis screen using a synthetic human ACE2 mutant library
identified variants that either increased or decreased its binding to SARS-CoV-2 Sprotein (Procko, 2020). Using a sequencing-based enrichment assay, the fold
enrichment or depletion of the mutant sequences was measured in this study (Procko,
2020). Mapping the enrichment z-scores from this study (Procko, 2020) to the spectrum
of natural ACE2 polymorphisms, we identified several rare ACE2 variants (Figure 1c)
that likely alter their binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and thereby protect or render
individuals more susceptible to the virus(Supplementary Table 2). The majority of the
variants that were predicted to alter the interaction between ACE2 and the virus Sprotein were clustered around the N-terminal region of ACE2 that interacts with the Sprotein (Figure 1b).
Included among the ACE2 polymorphic variants that increase ACE2/S-protein
interaction are S19P, I21V, E23K, K26R, K26E, T27A, N64K, T92I, Q102P, M383T and
H378R (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 3). Among these, the
T92I polymorphism stands out in particular because it is part of a NxT/S (where x is any
amino acid except proline) consensus N-glycosylation motif (Gavel and von Heijne,
1990) where N90 is the site of N-glycan addition. The ACE2 NxT/S motif, while
conserved in 96 out of 296 jawed vertebrate with ACE2 sequence available is absent or
altered in several species, including the civet cat (Paguma larvata) and several bat
species where residue N90 is mutated, a proline is present at position 91 or the T92 is
altered to any amino acid except serine (Figure 1d, Supplementary Figure 4 and
Supplementary Table 3) (Demogines et al., 2012; Gavel and von Heijne, 1990; Li et
al., 2005b). These ACE2 variations are expected to abolish glycosylation at N90 (Gavel
and von Heijne, 1990). Furthermore, a mutation that altered the NxT/S motif in human

ACE2 to a civet ACE2-like sequence (90-NLTV-93 to DAKI), expected to abolish the Nglycosylation, increased the SARS-CoV infectivity and S-protein binding (Figure 1d) (Li
et al., 2005b). The T92I mutant we identified showed a strong enrichment in the
sequencing-based screen for S-protein binders (Procko, 2020). Considering these
observations, we conclude that the T92I mutation increases the ACE2/S-protein binding
affinity rendering individuals harboring this mutation more susceptibility to the virus.
Variants that are predicted to reduce the virus S-protein interactions and thereby
decrease S/ACE2 binding affinity include K31R, N33I, H34R, E35K, E37K, D38V, Y50F,
N51S, K68E, F72V, Y83H, G326E, G352V, D355N and Q388L. Below we discuss the
structural basis for the inhibitory effect on ACE2/S-protein binding for this selected set of
mutations, as well as for the enhancing effect of the selected polymorphisms that were
shown to increase ACE2/S-protein binding in vitro (Procko, 2020).

Structural evaluation of ACE2 polymorphism
To further understand the effect of the polymorphisms on receptor recognition by
the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and to confirm our predictions, we structurally modeled the
identified ACE2 variants using the recently published cryo-EM and crystal structures of
ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexes (Supplementary Table 4) (Shang et al., 2020;
Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). We combined our structural
analysis predictions with data from the Procko study (Procko, 2020) and classified the
polymorphisms into five categories. These included mutations that directly enhanced or
disrupted the residues at the ACE2/S-protein binding interface or residues interacting
with the N90-linked glycan. We term these mutations as “directly enhancing” or “directly
disrupting”. We also identified variants that were "indirectly enhancing" or "indirectly
disrupting”. These mutants were found to affect the residues that are at the ACE2/Sprotein binding interface but not in direct contact with the CoV-2 RBD residues. Lastly,
we found several mutants that are located distal to the ACE2/S-protein binding site and
do not mediate direct or indirect contacts with CoV-2 RBD. We classified these variants
as "not relevant" in the context of our analysis. The enhancing variants were enriched in
the mutagenesis screen (Procko, 2020), while those ACE2 variants predicted to disrupt
or weaken the ACE2/S-protein interactions were depleted (Procko, 2020).

Polymorphic variants mapped onto the ACE2 structure remarkably segregate into
two distinct clusters at the ACE2/CoV-2 RBD interface (Figure 2). Enhancing variants
cluster to the ACE2 surface most proximal to the receptor-binding ridge of CoV-2 RBD
(Figure 3a) whereas the majority of the disrupting variants reside centrally on the two
major ACE2 α-helices that substantially contribute to the buried surface area at the
interface (Figure 4a). Interestingly, the loop conformation in the receptor-binding ridge
differs significantly in SARS-CoV-2 from that of SARS-CoV owing to the presence of
bulky residues (V483 and E484) in the loop (Shang et al., 2020). This feature allows the
CoV-2 loop to extend further towards ACE2 establishing more extensive contacts with
the receptor. Hence, natural ACE2 variants in this region could be exploited by the
CoV-2 loop, increasing susceptibility to viral infection. In contrast, most interactions that
CoV-2 makes with the core of the ACE2 interface are centered on two α-helices and are
mostly not unique to CoV-2. They seem to encompass critical binding hotspots,
discussed below, and thus centrally located polymorphic variants are more likely to
reduce viral recognition.
By far the most frequent variant identified in our data, K26R (~0.4% allele
frequency), is predicted to enhance ACE2 affinity for SARS-CoV-2. Structural analysis
of this polymorphism shows that K26 establishes polar contacts with the first mannose
moiety of the ACE2 N90-linked glycan and likely stabilizes the position of the glycan
relative to ACE2 (Figure 3b). As discussed above, the N90-linked glycan emerges as
an important determinant of CoV-2 infectivity and may diminish ACE2 affinity for the
RBD possibly through steric hindrance imposed by branching of the sugar modifications
(Demogines et al., 2012). We predict that K26R would abrogate stabilizing polar
contacts with N90, impairing coordination of the glycan (Figure 3b) and lead to an
increase in the affinity of the virus to the ACE2 receptor. At the same time, R26 is now
primed to establish backbone and side chain interactions with ACE2 D30 which then is
poised to build a salt-bridge with CoV-2 RBD K417 (Figure 3b). The net effect of R26
polymorphism would then be the stabilization of core α-helices that increases ACE2
binding affinity to CoV-2 RBD at the cost of glycan rigidity. As discussed above,
another enhancing variant, T92I, is structurally predicted to lead to similar effects by
directly eliminating the N90-linked glycan.

Whereas the K26R variant stabilizes core ACE2 α-helical interactions, other
naturally occurring polymorphic variants appear to locally destabilize or alter the Nterminus of ACE2 helix 1 (α1) conformation. The T27A mutant (Figure 3c) removes
side chain-backbone and backbone-backbone interactions between T27 and E30 likely
increasing the local dynamics of helix α1. This would allow the N-terminus of α1 to
bend slightly and accommodate the unique CoV-2 RBD receptor binding-ridge loop that
more intimately contacts ACE2 compared to its SARS-CoV counterpart. Another
predicted effect of the T27A variant is increased hydrophobicity at the interface, which
could contribute to an increase in binding affinity. Similar destabilizing patterns can be
inferred for S19P and E23K (Supplementary Table 4). Thus, the local α1 N-terminal
helical flexibility along with N90 glycan destabilization may help accommodate the
protrusive CoV-2 RBD receptor-binding ridge to form more extensive contacts with
ACE2 and facilitate viral entry specifically for this virus.
ACE2 polymorphic variants predicted to confer protection against the virus
(Supplementary Tables 2 and 4) present compelling mechanistic explanations for how
they may offer protection against the virus. The vast majority of disruptive variants map
to the core α-helical bundle of ACE2 and to residues known to form contacts with the
RBD (Figure 4a). There are two key hotspots in the α-helical bundle of the ACE2
interface that are important for CoV-2 RBD binding: K31 and K353 (Figure 4a, right
panel). To enable interaction with the virus, these charged residues need to be
accommodated in a largely hydrophobic environment at the binding interface and hence
their neutralization is critical to the binding of coronavirus RBDs to human ACE2 (Li,
2008; Shang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2012). A recent elegant study (Shang et al., 2020)
showed that SARS-CoV-2 S-protein is more effective in neutralization of the lysine
hotspots than SARS-CoV due to the presence of Q493 and L455 that stabilize K31, and
N501 that stabilizes K353, (Figure 4A, right panel). Interestingly, K31R is one of the
human ACE2 polymorphisms that we identified (Supplementary Table 2). Introduction
of an arginine not only maintains the positive charge at position 31 but is also predicted
to break an interaction with Q493 in the RBD (Supplementary Figure 5a) and
destabilize the charge-neutralizing interaction with the virus. Thus, individuals carrying
K31R ACE2 variants are predicted to be less prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection. While we

did not identify any polymorphic variants at residue K353, we detected an ACE2
mutation that changes the identity of D38 residue (Supplementary Table 2), which
forms an electrostatic interaction with K353 (Supplementary Table 4). This mutation
(D38V) would compromise the neutralizing effect of the K353-D38 interaction at the
interface and is predicted to significantly reduce binding affinity between the virus and
the host receptor.
Another recurrent polymorphism in ACE2 maps to residue E35 and changes it to
a lysine (Supplementary Table 1). E35 establishes a critical polar contact with SARSCoV-2 S-protein residue Q493, which is predicted to be attenuated in the presence of
the positively charged lysine (Figure 4B). Interestingly, E35 is not conserved between
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S-proteins (Shang et al., 2020) and hence we predict that
it could offer selective protection from the SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals carrying
this variant. Other variants found in our analysis, including H34R (Figure 4C) and
D38V, similarly result in a loss of interface polar contacts which are predicted to reduce
ACE2 affinity for the viral RBD domain. Another interesting polymorphism at position 83
results in Y83H alteration. Residue Y83 underlies a hydrophobic pocket into which F486
from SARS-CoV-2 RBD is inserted (Supplementary Figure 5b). This is another unique
interaction involving ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 RBD F486 that is absent in SARS-CoV
RBD where, the equivalent residue is a leucine (Shang et al., 2020). The
polymorphism that replaces Y83 with a polar histidine will compromise the hydrophobic
character of this unique pocket in addition to removing a polar contact with N487
(Supplementary Figure 5b), potentially offering selective protection from the SARS
CoV-2 infections.

Discussion
The host-virus evolutionary arms race over time leads to natural selection that
alters both the host and the viral proteins allowing both to increase their fitness
(Daugherty and Malik, 2012). In this context multiple studies have analyzed and
identified the origin, evolution and successful adaption of the SARS coronaviruses as
human pathogens (Andersen et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020). Viral genome sequencing
and analysis has identified bats as the most likely natural host of origin for both SARS-

CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2 (Guo et al., 2020). In particular, several studies have
focused on the viral S-protein RBD that interacts with its host ACE2 receptor and
identified key changes between the bat CoVs and other suspected intermediary host
CoVs found in the civet and pangolin (Andersen et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Shang
et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). These studies
have identified S-protein changes that have rendered the human cells permissive to the
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection (Chen et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Walls et
al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020).
Thus far, the role of variations in human ACE2 receptor in susceptibility to both
SARS CoVs had not been comprehensively examined. A recent study analyzed a
limited ACE2 population variation data set and concluded that these polymorphisms did
not confer resistance to the virus (Cao et al., 2020a). In this study, we have examined
human ACE2 variation data compiled from multiple data sets and identified
polymorphisms that will either likely render individuals more susceptible to the SARSCoV-2 or protect them from the virus. Using structural predictions based on published
protein structures and data from an elegant mutagenesis screen that used deep
sequencing to assess enrichment or depletion of S-protein binding ACE2 variants, we
classified the variants identified in this study for the effects on susceptibility to SARSCoV (Procko, 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yan et
al., 2020). In particular, human ACE2 variants K26R, S16P, T27A, K31R, H34R, E35K,
E37K, D38V, N51S, N64K, K68E, F72V, T921, Q102P, G326E, G352V, D355N,
H378R, Q388L, and D509Y are predicted to increase the susceptibility of the individuals
carrying these variations. It is interesting to note that the T921I ACE2 variant is part of
the consensus NxS/T N-glycosylation motif and is predicted to abolish glycosylation of
the conserved N90 residue. Our structural investigation suggests that this mutation will
favor improved viral S-protein binding. A previous study showed that the ACE2 N90
renders human cells resistant to Civet CoV (Li et al., 2005b). Recently, N90 and T92
ACE2 mutations were enriched in a screen for CoV-2 S-protein binding (Procko, 2020).
Taken together, these observations suggest that N90 and T92 are critical ACE2
residues that confer protection and are CoV host modifiers. We also found variants
K31R, E35K, E37K, D38V, N33I, H34R, Q388L and Y83H in ACE2 that are predicted to

show decreased binding to SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and thus protect individuals
corresponding to these genotypes.
Overall, we find the ACE2 population variants, that either increase or decrease
susceptibility, to be rare, which is consistent with the overall low population ACE2
receptor polymorphisms (mean Fst 0.0167). Also, we did not observe significant
differences in ACE2 variant allele frequency among population groups. The variant
alleles also did not show discernable gender distribution differences, even though ACE2
is a X-linked gene. The SARS-CoV infections and its deadly effects in humans are
more recent and thus the pathogenic and protective variants have not been subject to
purifying selection and therefore the variants we observe are predictably rare.
The expression levels of ACE2 and its variants in appropriate host tissue may
modulate the deleterious effect of the virus. To further understand the importance of the
ACE2 variants in susceptibility, it will be important to correlate clinical outcomes with
ACE2 genotypes at population scale. The extremes in COVID-19 clinical symptoms
reported ranging from asymptomatic infected adult individuals to those that show acute
respiratory syndrome leading to death (Cao et al., 2020b; Cascella et al., 2020; Yuen et
al., 2020), suggest a role for additional factors, including the role of innate and adaptive
immunity, besides ACE2 variants in modifying disease outcomes.
Currently, there are no approved therapeutics for treating or preventing COVID19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, development of therapeutics to treat
patients and mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic is urgently needed (Cascella et al., 2020;
Jiang, 2020). Several small molecules and neutralizing antibodies for treatment are in
development (Li and De Clercq, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b). Soluble ACE2 and ACE2-Fc
fusion protein have been proposed as decoy SARS-CoV-2 receptor therapeutic
(Hofmann et al., 2004; Kruse, 2020; Lei et al., 2020). Soluble ACE2, as a therapy for
pulmonary arterial hypertension, has been shown to be safe in early in-human clinical
studies (Guignabert et al., 2018; Haschke et al., 2013). A rationally designed,
catalytically inactive, human ACE2 that carries one or more of the natural variants
predicted to show improved binding to SARS viral S-protein RBD could be safely
developed as a soluble protein with or without an Fc domain for treatment of COVID-19.

Methods
Identification of ACE2 variation
We queried multiple genomic databases including gnomaAD (Karczewski et al., 2019)
(https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/), DicoverEHR (Dewey et al., 2016), RotterdamStudy
(Ikram et al., 2017), ALSPAC (Fraser et al., 2013) and Asian specific databases which
included GenomeAsia100k (GenomeAsia, 2019), HGDP (Bergstrom et al., 2020),
TOMMO-3.5kjpnv2 (Tadaka et al., 2019) IndiGen (https://indigen.igib.in/) and Other
aggregated data for ACE2 protein altering variations in populations groups across the
world. The ACE2 genotypes in this study were from over 290,000 samples representing
over 400 population groups across the world.
Fst Analysis
To assess genetic variation in the coding region of ACE2, we calculated the fixation
index (Fst) from 2,381 unrelated individuals across 26 populations in the 1000
Genomes Project Phase 3 and 57,783 female individuals across eight populations in
gnomAD. For 1000 Genome data, we used the Weir and Cockerham (1984) method as
implemented in vcftools (Version 0.1.17); the weighted Fst were calculated from 88
variants. For gnomAD (v2.1.1), because we only have access to the allele counts, we
used the original formulation by Wright (1969) and reported the weighted mean Fst as
described in Bhatia et al. (2013); 277 variants were used. Because Fst values vary
based on variants used (Bhatia et al. 2013), we calculated the Fst in a set of randomly
selected genes on the same chromosomes matched by the length decile to use for
comparison. To assess if variants in the peptidase domain has lower genetic variation,
we used the one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare 15 variants in the peptidase
domain against 50 variants outside. Variants with Fst < 1e-4 were removed as they
were uninformative.
ACE2 ortholog sequence analysis
A total of 295 Human ACE2 orthologs were obtained from NCBI (Supplementary Table
3 for accession numbers). A snake ACE2 ortholog protein was obtained from the

published Indian cobra genome (Suryamohan et al., 2020). Multiple sequence
alignment of residues surrounding the ACE2 NxT/S motif was performed using MCoffee
(www.tcoffee.org). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the PhyML webserver
(www.phylogeny.fr).

Structural Analysis
Each identified variant was mapped, modeled, and analyzed in Pymol using the recently
deposited crystal structures 6VW1 and 6LZG of human ACE2 bound to either chimeric
SARS CoV-2 RBD (6VW1) or complete SARS CoV-2 RBD (6LZG).
