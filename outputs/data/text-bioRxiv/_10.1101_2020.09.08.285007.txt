Abstract

23

The COVID-19 outbreak introduced unprecedented health-risks, as well as pressure on the

24

financial, social, and psychological well-being due to the response to the outbreak. Here, we

25

examined the manifestations of the COVID-19 outbreak on the brain structure in the healthy

26

population, following the initial phase of the pandemic in Israel. We pre-registered our

27

hypothesis that the intense experience of the outbreak potentially induced stress-related brain

28

modifications. Volumetric changes in n = 50 participants who were scanned before and after the

29

COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown, were compared with n = 50 control participants who were

30

scanned twice prior to the pandemic. The pandemic provided a rare opportunity to examine brain

31

plasticity in a natural experiment. We found volumetric increases in bilateral amygdalae,

32

putamen, and the anterior temporal cortices. Changes in the amygdalae diminished as time

33

elapsed from lockdown relief, suggesting that the intense experience associated with the

34

pandemic outbreak induced transient volumetric changes in brain regions commonly associated

35

with stress and anxiety.

Main

38

Since early 2020, the world has been coping with the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019

39

(COVID-19) pandemic that infected millions with devastating numbers of deaths globally. As an

40

initial response to the first wave of the outbreak, countries closed their borders and implemented

41

a series of ad-hoc laws and orders to restrict the spread of the disease. Countries with major

42

outbreaks such as China, Italy, and Spain enforced stringent restriction of movement for a

43

limited period, referred to here as ‘lockdown’. Although lockdowns contributed to restricting the

44

health risks of the outbreak1, they also had a negative impact on the social, financial and mental

45

well-being of the general population, leading to one of the sharpest declines in economic growth

46

over the past decades2,3. COVID-19 outbreak also led to high rates of stress and anxiety that

47

were largely attributed to implications beyond actual health risk, such as the difficulties of social

48

isolation and financial consequences of responding to the health crisis4. It is now evident that the

49

indirect consequences of the pandemic affected a much larger proportion of the population,

50

having an impact of no lesser gravity than the actual health risks that were meant to be

51

prevented5,6.

52

In Israel, a strict lockdown period was issued from mid-March until the end of April. During its

53

peak, most unessential businesses were closed and civilians’ movement for non-essential

54

destinations was restricted to a radius of 100 meters from their homes. Prior to COVID-19, the

55

country had experienced a period of peak economic prosperity7, which was interrupted by the

56

outbreak, leading to unprecedented unemployment rates (reaching nearly 30% of the work-force

57

in April 2020) and the collapse of several sectors such as aviation, tourism, and culture8,9. The

58

outbreak period was characterized with acute uncertainty and increase in anxiety, regarding both

59

the health and socioeconomic effects of the pandemic10.

60

Over the past years, several studies demonstrated the potential to detect brain plasticity using T1-

61

weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)11–13. The current work was initiated as a reaction to

62

the outbreak of COVID-19 in Israel, aiming to study the structural brain plasticity in the general

63

population following a real-life event of global scale. For this purpose, we examined n = 50 test

64

group participants that were scanned with T1-weighted MRI prior to the outbreak and returned

65

for a follow-up scan after the lockdown period (see methods for a detailed timeline of post

66

COVID-19 follow-up scans). The structural changes of the study group (before versus after the

67

outbreak) were compared to those of n = 50 control participants who were scanned twice before

68

the COVID-19 outbreak. The unique circumstances imposed due to the COVID-19 lockdown

69

created rare settings for a natural experiment to examine the effect of a real-world intense event

70

on brain plasticity.

71

All participants were healthy, without a history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, did not

72

show COVID-19 symptoms, and were not diagnosed carrying the virus (see the methods section

73

for further demographic information). The hypotheses and general design of the current study

74

were pre-registered prior to the completion of data collection and were based on a small

75

independent pilot sample with N = 16 participants (n = 8 participants in each group). The data

76

and analysis codes are openly shared online (project page: https://osf.io/wu37z/; preregistration:

77

Results

79

Prior to their follow-up MRI scan session, we asked participants of the post-lockdown test group

80

to fill in a short questionnaire regarding the lockdown period (see methods). Of the participants

81

who agreed to reply, 79.6% reported they did not leave their home for non-essential needs,

82

79.6% met no more than 3 people, 44.9% did not meet with their parents at all, 38.8% indicated

83

an increased feeling of anxiety following the lockdown, 34.7% anticipated that their future

84

behavior will change after the lockdown, 46.8% reported they were concerned about their

85

personal future well-being, 42.9% indicated that their employment status was reduced to part-

86

time or unemployment/furlough. In an exploratory factor analysis (EFA; using Varimax rotation,

87

see methods), we identified two main factors, explaining together 54.0% of the variance. The

88

first factor was highly loaded with questionnaire items that described increased social isolation,

89

and the second was mainly related to increased feelings of anxiety (Figure 1).

Based on our pilot study results and previous studies of stress-related morphological brain
in

104

changes14–17, we hypothesized that the focus of volumetric changes will be observed mainly in

105

the amygdalae. T1-weighted anatomical MRI scans were used as input for deformation and

Following surface reconstruction, each participant’s individual gray matter volume was

accounted for the longitudinal nature of the data, performing the analysis on both scans

113

simultaneously. To avoid voxel-based multiple comparisons, we performed a region-based

114

analysis (following surface projection to the Hammer atlas) and corrected for multiple

115

comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction18 to control for false discovery rate (FDR;

116

using p < 0.05 following correction threshold). Validation of the pipeline was performed using

117

simulated data and by comparing the results with other software (see methods).

118

Using a linear mixed model, we examined volumetric changes, testing for regions with stronger

119

changes for the test group compared to the control group. Examining the interaction effect of

120

session (baseline versus follow-up scans) and experimental group (test versus control) revealed

121

ten anatomical brain regions (composed of bilateral five unique regions in both hemispheres) in

122

which volumetric increases were observed uniquely for the test group (Table 1 and Figure 2).

123

Most prominently, as we expected and pre-registered, we found a robust effect in the bilateral

124

amygdalae. We also observed a significant effect bilaterally in the putamen, and in three

125

anatomical regions within the ventral anterior temporal cortex adjacent to each other, namely in

126

the medial part of the anterior temporal lobe, the fusiform gyrus, and the parahippocampal gyrus.

127

To examine the spatial distribution within significant ROIs, we performed an additional post-hoc

128

voxel-based analysis, which allowed us to visualize the changes within the significant ROIs

129

(Figure 2a). Examining the post-hoc voxel-based results revealed that volumetric changes

130

occurred throughout the entire surface of bilateral amygdalae, while in the putamen the effects

131

occurred mainly in the dorsal area. In the ventral anterior temporal cortices, large connected

132

clusters of volumetric change spanned throughout the three adjacent temporal ROIs, thus

133

suggesting that the three ROIs shared a similar origin. To ensure that the reported effects

134

originated from volumetric changes in the test group following the COVID-19 outbreak and its

135

related lockdown period, we tested for ROIs where the significant interaction effect was

137

consistent beyond baseline scans effect or measurement protocol (see methods).

To evaluate and control for the effect of time between scans and time from lockdown, we

details). The two covariates were not correlated with each other in our test group sample (r = -

163

0.106, t(48) = -0.74, p = 0.463). Our reported regions demonstrated significant volumetric
ric

164

change above and beyond these covariates. After FDR correction, no region showed an effect of

165

TBS. However, we did find a negative effect of TFL in the two amygdalae ROIs and the left

fusiform gyrus, suggesting that the volumetric changes in these regions moderated as timee

Discussion

188

Our study demonstrates that volumetric change patterns in the brain occurred following the

189

COVID-19 initial outbreak period and restrictions in a sample of healthy participants, who were

190

not somatically affected by the pandemic. While previous studies demonstrated brain plasticity

191

using T1-weighted MRI following planned interventions11–13, the current work outstands in its

192

unique demonstration of stark structural brain plasticity following a major real-life event.

193

Our findings show neural changes that were not caused directly due to COVID-19 infection, but

194

rather related to the societal effect. We show volumetric increase in gray matter in the

195

amygdalae, putamen and ventral anterior temporal cortices. The changes in the amygdalae

196

showed a temporal-dependent effect, related to the time elapsed from lockdown but not the

197

duration from the baseline scan. It should be noted that although lockdown restrictions had

198

initially reduced infection rates in Israel, just one month after the lockdown was lifted, the

199

number of infected cases started to rise again and reached higher number of active infected cases

200

by the end of data collection, compared with the peak numbers during the actual lockdown

201

period (approximately 2,000 daily new cases by the end of July versus under 750 new daily cases

202

during the peak of the lockdown period in April19, see methods and Figure 4). This suggests that

203

the effects observed in the current study are less likely to be attributed to the concrete health

204

risks of COVID-19, but rather to the first wave of the outbreak, characterized with perceived

205

uncertainty and substantial unexpected changes in everyday life.

206

The current study was in many aspects unplanned; therefore, we are left with only partial

207

answers as to which specific components of the COVID-19 outbreak led to the neural changes

208

observed in the healthy participants that took part in our study. The involvement of the amygdala

209

may suggest that stress and anxiety could be the source of the observed phenomenon, due to its

210

well-recorded functional and structural associations14–17,20–22. Nevertheless, it is hard to draw

211

clear conclusions as many aspects of life have changed in this time period, and could have

212

potentially affected different regions in the brain – from limiting social interactions, increased

213

financial stress, changes in physical activity, work routine, and many more. The limited

214

behavioral data collected in the current study did not provide a strong connection to the imaging

215

results, and thus future work could try to better address the complex brain-behavioral

216

associations in this real-life experience. Nonetheless, our findings show that healthy young

217

adults, with no records of mental health issues, were deeply affected by the outbreak of COVID-

218

19. We suggest that policy makers take into consideration the impact of their actions on the

219

general well-being of the population they seek to help, alongside the efficacy of disease

220

prevention.

a control group, scanned twice before COVID-19 lockdown. All participants had no background

232

of neurological disorders, did not show symptoms for COVID-19 and were not diagnosed as

233

carriers of the virus. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Tel Aviv University and

234

institutional review board (IRB) at the Sheba Tel-Hashomer medical center. Since the IRB

235

protocol allowed us to scan the participants several times over a long period of time, we were

236

able to collect the data from participants who were scanned prior to COVID-19 outbreak and

237

invite them back for a follow-up scan as part of the longitudinal study they have agreed to take

238

part in. Participants received monetary compensation for their time and gave their informed

239

consent to take part in a longitudinal experiment aimed to examine brain plasticity across several

240

sessions, which was initially not directly related to COVID-19 outbreak.

241

The test group comprised of n = 50 participants who were scanned before and after COVID-19

242

lockdown (Δ Time between scans: M = 309.3, SD = 207.5, range = 67 - 1460 days; Age: M =

243

30.1, SD = 6.65, range = 21 - 48; Females: n = 20, prop. = 40%). The lockdown period began on

244

March 25th and was gradually relieved throughout late April. We mark here May 1st as the

245

lockdown relief date, as on this day an issued 100-meters movement limit for non-essential needs

246

was lifted. The test group data collection started as soon as lockdown relief took place, for a

247

period of approximately 3 months, until the end of July, 2020 (Δ Time from lockdown relief: M

248

= 57 days, SD = 24.62, range = 9 - 89 days; see Figure 4 for the study timeline).

Figure 4. Study timeline and outbreak data
On February 21st, 2020, the first COVID-19 case in Israel was recorded. Daily new cases were
re
smoothed using 7-days moving average. Data were retrieved and modified based on the Israeli
eli
Ministry of Health reports19,23. A lockdown was issued on March 25th, which was gradually
lly
released until the removal of the 100-meter restriction on May 1st, marking lockdown onset and
nd
relief, respectively (shorter vertical dashed line). MRI data of the test group were collected
ed
th
th
between May 10 to July 29 (longer vertical dashed line). Red bars on top represent the number
er
of participants scanned for the study each day.

259

261

As a control group, we used the data of n = 50 participants who were scanned twice using a
similar protocol before COVID-19 lockdown (Δ Time between scans: M = 126.7, SD = 190.4,
.4,

262

range = 21 - 886 days; Age: M = 27.3, SD = 5.63, range = 19 - 42; Females: n = 23, prop.. =

263

46%).

264

The minimal sample size was determined and pre-registered (https://osf.io/uktsn), based on a

265

80% power analysis conducted using R ‘pwr’ package24, on a pilot study with N = 16

266

participants (n = 8 in each group). We decided to collect a minimum of n = 37 participants which
ch

267

should provide 80% to detect the group and session interaction effect with

268

the left and right amygdala, under the assumption that it would be difficult to complete the
he

269

sample due to COVID-19 limitations. Eventually, thanks to further relief in COVID-19
19

270

restrictions, we were able to extend the sample size to n = 50 in each group.

271

The results remain generally consistent, even when the data included only the first n = 37

272

participant;

273

parahippocampal gyrus and the left anterior temporal lobe. In this smaller sample, we did not
ot

274

find significant effects in the right anterior temporal lobe, nor in the fusiform gyrus. We also

found volumetric increase effects that were not identified using the full sample in the left nucleus

276

accumbens, left cuneus, and left insula.

277

Imaging data

278

Acquisition protocol. Imaging data were acquired using a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner, with a

279

64-channel head coil. For the structural data, T1w high resolution (1-mm3) whole brain images

280

were acquired with a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) pulse sequence

281

with repetition time (TR) of 2.53s, echo time (TE) of 2.88ms, flip angle (FA) = 7°, field-of-view

282

(FOV) = 224 × 224 × 208 mm, resolution = 1 × 1 × 1. Since for this project we combined data

283

from different labs, some of the participants had their scans aligned to the anterior commissure -

284

posterior commissure (AC-PC) line, while others were scanned with a 30° angle (50% of test

285

group participants and 80% of control group participants).

286

Some participants were also scanned with diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging (DW EPI)

287

sequence and some with functional gradient-echo EPI (GE EPI) in a resting state scan. The

288

analyses of these scans are beyond the scope of the current study.

289

Data processing and analysis. The T1-weighted MPRAGE anatomical scans were used for a

290

surface-based morphometry (SBM) analysis. From the images we estimated the pial and inner

291

surfaces of the cortex and projected those into the Hammers atlas (Hammers et al., 2003). Data

292

were preprocessed in SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/, Wellcome

293

Trust Centre for Neuroimaging) and SPM based CAT12 (Computational Anatomy Toolbox 12;

294

http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/, University of Jena) extension. We deployed the CAT12

295

surface-processing pipeline, which includes skull striping, a denoising filter25 projection-based

296

thickness estimation26, partial volume correction, and spatial normalization to MNI space. Prior

297

to the preregistration of the protocol, we validated the reliability of our surface-based image

298

processing pipeline, by simulating artificial activity in the amygdala, and using FreeSurfer based

299

analysis of cortical regions (See supplementary materials for further details).

300

Surface-based volumetric data of cortical and subcortical regions were segmented based on the

301

Hammers Atlas, segmenting the volumetric data into 58 anatomically defined regions. Ten

302

additional ROIs of non-gray matter or non-cerebral structures (ventricles, white matter, brain-

303

stem and cerebellum ROIs) were excluded from statistical analyses. To evaluate the effect of

304

lockdown on volumetric imaging data we ran a mixed linear model on the data within each one

305

of the 58 anatomical regions, examining the effect of session (baseline versus follow-up scan)

306

and group interaction (test versus control), controlling for time between scans (TBS) and time

307

following lockdown (TFL) covariates. Both covariates were mean centered before they were

308

added to the model. To include TFL covariate in the same model with control group participants,

309

for which TFL was irrelevant, control groups’ participants were assigned with the mean TFL;

310

thus, their data was not used to evaluate the effect of TFL.

311

To identify our regions of interest we only included regions that showed both a significant

312

interaction effect (i.e. the volumetric difference between the two sessions was significantly

313

different for the test and control group), and a significant session effect within the test group (i.e.

314

a significant difference between the two sessions for the test group). Results were corrected for

315

multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) correction18, based on the number of

316

brain regions tested. Following the analysis pipeline, we identified ten significant ROIs: bilateral

317

amygdalae, putamen, parahippocampal gyrus, the medial part of the anterior temporal lobe, and

318

the fusiform gyrus.

319

An additional ROI of the right inferior and middle temporal gyri showed a significant interaction

320

effect (interaction estimate = 0.17, 95% CI = [0.05, 0.29], p = 6.1E-3, padj. = 0.035), however

321

examining the test group separately, we could not identify a significant session effect (session

322

estimate = 0.04, 95% CI = [-0.02, 0.10], p = 0.259, padj. = 0.424). Therefore, it is harder to

323

interpret that this interaction effect stemmed from the test group. Thus, we did not include this

324

ROI as one of our significant ROIs. A less robust session effect within the test group was also

325

observed for the left parahippocampal gyrus (session estimate = 0.04 [0.00, 0.08], p = 0.029, padj.

326

= 0.085) and right fusiform gyrus ROI (session estimate = 0.05 [0.00, 0.10], p = 0.044, padj. =

327

0.111), however as these ROIs demonstrated strong interaction effects and their session effects

328

were significant before FDR correction, we decided to report them together with the other

329

significant regions. A similar procedure was used in the pre-registration (i.e. including only

330

regions that showed a significant interaction and an effect in the test group); however, in the

331

analysis of the pilot for the pre-registration, we used uncorrected results due to the small sample

332

size.

333

To examine the spatial distribution of our effect within significant ROIs, that were identified

334

with the SBM analysis, we performed an additional post-hoc voxel-based analysis. We projected

335

the data on a voxel-based map, effectively examining which voxels demonstrated an interaction

336

effect. Then, we used anatomical masks of ROIs which were found to be significant in the SBM

analysis, to visualize the results within these regions, similarly to a small-volume correction

338

analysis (Figure 2a).

339

Behavioral data

340

Data collection. To evaluate participants’ experience in the peak days of the COVID-19

341

outbreak, we asked them to think back on their experience during this time and fill out a 7-items

342

questionnaire regarding their experience of the COVID-19 lockdown (see Table 2 for a

343

description of the items). The questionnaires were filled out after the initiation of the study, when

344

the lockdown’s stringent 100-meters limitation was lifted, thus the results represents the

345

participants’ recalled experience of the lockdown. Most participants filled out the questionnaire

346

on the day of the post-lockdown scan session, some filled it a few days before their second

347

scanning session. A total of n = 76 participants filled out the COVID-19 questionnaire and

348

comprised the potential pool of test group participants for the current study, out of which n = 50

349

were sampled and scanned. One participant was scanned but did not complete the questionnaire,

350

therefore this participant’s behavioral data were not used and analyses of the questionnaire were

351

based on n = 49 valid participants.

355

Exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Responses to the lockdown questionnaire were coded into

356

binary responses, based on the sample median, splitting the sample into relatively similar sized

357

groups for each item (Table 2). To identify the main themes in the questionnaire, which could be

358

correlated with the imaging data, we performed an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on the

359

binarized data, using the “psych” R package27.

360

Since EFA require large number of participants, we used the data from all available n = 75

361

participants who completed the questionnaire. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) factor adequacy test

362

revealed that the ‘employment’ item had a very low measure of sampling adequacy (MSA;

363

employment item’s MSA = 0.26; which is far below the suggested minimal MSA of 0.528) for

364

EFA. The ‘employment’ was also not loaded to any of the factors; therefore, we removed it from

365

the final EFA model. Overall, even after removing low KMO item, our data was found to be

366

weakly appropriate for factor analysis, with overall MSA = 0.48. Thus, considering the small

367

sample size and low fit of the data to EFA, the results of the analysis should be interpreted with

368

caution.

369

We performed polychoric correlations based EFA, which is suitable for binary variables, with

370

two factors and Varimax rotation, assuming orthogonality between the factors. Our selection of

371

number of factors was based on visual inspection of scree plot of eigenvalues, as well as by

372

comparing actual data to simulations of random data matrices. Using Oblimin rotation, which

373

allows for correlation between the factors, revealed very low correlation (r = 0.08), suggesting

374

that Varimax rotation was an appropriate choice for our model.

375

To examine the association of the behavioral data with the volumetric changes, while

376

maintaining relatively limited number of multiple comparisons, we used the two factors for these

377

analyses instead of each of the items. These two factors’ scores for each participant were

378

extracted and correlated with the change in gray matter volumetric data in our regions of interest

379

(see supplementary materials for results of this exploratory analysis).

Validation using different statistical modeling

470

In our work, we found volumetric change effect following COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown.

471

Our principle statistical analysis was based on the differences in volume values of the baseline

472

and follow-up scans of each participant. To easily compare the effect in each brain region, we

473

report and illustrate the change effect in units of percent change:

To further corroborate the validity of our results, we examined the volumetric change effect

values. To make sure that the volumetric change effect that we observed in the test group is

487

robust above and beyond initial baseline scan, we examined a linear model with the follow-up
up

488

scan volume as our dependent variable and the baseline scan as an additional covariate. The
he

489

results showed consistent interaction effect. In all 10 significant ROIs, even when baseline scans

Adding gender had no effect on the reported results. However, the scan angle was correlated

with the group and the TFL variables, such that a larger proportion of control-group participants

509

participants who were scanned with the 30° angle were mostly scanned in the later days of data

510

collection (TFL and scan-angle correlation: r = 0.615, t(48) = 5.41, p = 2.0E-6). The addition of

511

the scan angle to the model therefore had an impact on the significance of other effects: (1) all

512

reported TFL effects became non-significant after FDR-correction; and (2) while no additional

513

regions became significant for the group effect, the FDR-corrected p-value dropped just slightly

514

below the statistical significance threshold for the right amygdala (padj. = 0.058), right anterior

515

medial temporal lobe (padj. = 0.058), right parahipocampal gyrus (padj. = 0.058), left

516

parahipocampal gyrus (padj. = 0.074), right fusiform gyrus (padj. = 0.058) and left fusiform gyrus

517

(padj. = 0.074). The other regions remained significant (left amygdala padj. = 0.003, left anterior

518

medial temporal lobe padj. = 0.007, left putamen padj. = 0.010, and right putamen padj. = 0.007).

519

These results suggest that the scan angle had a slight impact on the significance of the effects,

520

probably due to poor balance of the condition across groups and time. Although some fail to

521

exceed the stringent statistical threshold after FDR by a small margin, overall the results remain

522

fairly consistent.

523

We further validated that our choice of measurement to analyze (difference of follow-up –

524

baseline scans) had no significant impact on our conclusions. In another analysis, we compared

525

the log-ratio between scans as our dependent variable, wherein log(follow-up/baseline) under the

526

null hypothesis is expected to be 0. Using the same analysis process with log-ratio scores as the

527

dependent variable resulted in the same 10 significant ROIs. Thus, our additional analysis

528

suggested that our reported results are robust to potential biases due to baseline scans and choice

529

of statistical analysis procedure.

530

Imaging pipeline validation

531

To validate the imaging processing protocol we used two approaches, before data collection was

532

completed (at the time of the pre-registration finalization). As many surface-based software

533

focus on analysis of cortical surfaces, rather than subcortical regions, we aimed to validate that

534

our SBM protocol using CAT12 could reliably identify subcortical morphological changes, such

535

as the ones we observed in the current study within the amygdala and putamen. To test the

536

detection capabilities of our protocol, we generated simulated data with volumetric changes in

537

the amygdala and ran the CAT12vpipeline on the simulated data. A volumetric increase in the

538

amygdala was simulated using a hand-drawn polygon mask, surrounding the left amygdala on

539

the original T1w images of 10 participants. Within this polygon 3D mask, the signal intensity

540

was artificially changed. Following this procedure, both the original and modified T1w images
es

541

underwent the same CAT12 pipeline. We were able to identify the simulated volumetric changes
es

542

within the subcortical amygdala nuclei (see supplementary Figure 3).

Sub-cortical changes in the left amygdala were simulated in 10 participants. The SBM pipeline

applied in CAT12 identified the simulated change effect. Data were projected from surfaces back

to a voxel-based map for visualization in the current figure.

548

549

In an additional validation procedure, we reanalyzed our results with an additional analysis
sis

550

pipeline. Raw T1-weighted maps were preprocessed using FreeSurfer. Using this alternative
ve

551

analysis pipeline, we found similar results, including robust effects on the temporal cortical
cal

552

regions in addition to other cortical regions. It should be noted that the FreeSurfer pipeline can
an

553

analyze only cortical surface, thus the analysis did not include subcortical regions of the
he

554

amygdala and putamen.

555

The results of both validations indicated our analysis pipeline could reliably identify regional
al

556

volumetric estimations. Using CAT12 provided an advantage by performing a longitudinal
al

557

analysis of subcortical regions, including the amygdala which was pre-hypothesized and of great
eat

558

importance in the current work.

559

Exploratory factor analyses: association with volumetric changes

560

As an exploratory analysis, we examined whether the volumetric brain changes were associated
ed

561

with the psychological constructs identified in our EFA, based on participants’ self-reports. In a

562

previous version of this manuscript, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify our
ur

563

factors of interest, however this procedure is less appropriate than EFA, and is therefore not
ot

564

reported here. However, the results using PCA were fairly similar to the ones we found with

567

We used two linear models to explain the variability in each of the factors, using the volumetric

568

changes as our model features.

569

Overall, neither one of the factors was well associated with the volumetric changes (Factor 1

570

model: R2 = 0.20, F(10,38) = 0.92, p = 0.522; Factor 2 model: R2 = 0.22, F(10,38) = 1.10, p =

571

0.383). Examining the contribution of individual ROIs within the models (measured as the

572

significance of the β estimates), did not reveal a significant association with the factors for any

573

one of the ROIs (padj. > 0.05; FDR correction by the number of features in the model). Adding

574

the two factors as covariates to the linear models examining the volumetric change effect, also

575

revealed no significant contribution of the factor to the models.

576

Thus, in our work we could not identify a clear association between the behavioral data and

577

volumetric changes in our detected ROIs.

578

Volumetric change correlation patterns

579

Finally, we examined correlation patterns of the volumetric change for all brain regions aiming

580

to identify shared change patterns across multiple ROIs. Hierarchical clustering of the correlation

581

matrices revealed different patterns between the two groups (Supplementary figure 4). In the test

582

group, three principal groups of clusters could be identified - the first included the palladium,

583

hippocampus, amygdala, putamen, insula (all bilaterally), and right anterior cingulate cortex, the

584

second cluster included mostly occipito-temporal cortical and subcortical nuclei, and the third

585

included highly correlated regions of the frontal, parietal and occipital cortices. All regions that

586

passed the statistical threshold of the SBM analysis (Table 1), except for the left fusiform gyrus,

587

were grouped closely together within the first two clusters, and showed low to negative

588

correlations the ROIs of the third cluster. This analysis could suggest that the origin of the

589

volumetric change observed in the regions of the two clusters might be different. The regions

590

that appear in cluster 1 are often reported in the studies that explore brain changes following

591

stress, anxiety or traumatic events14–17, while the regions of the second cluster are less associated

592

with specific phenomena.

593

A different pattern was observed in the control group, where the correlation pattern demonstrated

594

stronger volumetric synchrony (Supplementary figure 4b). This could suggest that changes in the

595

control group were much more affected by within-participant effects, rather than an exogenous

596

effect (which could be the outbreak and lockdown in the test-group). It is important to note in

597

this context that in addition to the experience of the lockdown, the participants in the test group

598

also had longer time gaps between the two scanning sessions, which might provide an alternative

599

explanation for the stronger homogeneity in volumetric changes within the control group.

Correlation coefficients were calculated between the volumetric change values for all ROI pairs,
analyzed separately for the test (a) and the control group (b), clustered according to Euclidean
distances into dendrograms. In the test group, the first and second cluster contained the
subcortical nuclei (amygdala and putamen) and temporal ROI which were found significant in
the SBM interaction analysis, respectively (highlighted in italic bold font). In the control group, a
more homogeneous change pattern was observed with more robust correlation coefficients
between the ROIs. Pearson correlation coefficients are represented by the color scheme.
