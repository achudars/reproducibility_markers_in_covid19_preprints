Abstract
The emerging acute respiratory disease, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus (SARS2 CoV) has
spread fastly all over the word. As a member of RNA viruses, the glycosylation of envelope glycoprotein plays the
crucial role in protein folding, evasing host immune system, invading host cell membrane, even affecting host
preference. Therefore, detail glyco-related researches have been adopted in the Spike protein (S-protein) of SARS2
CoV from the bioinformatic perspective. Phylogenic analysis of S-protein sequences revealed the evolutionary
relationship of N-glycosylation sites in different CoVs. Structural comparation of S-proteins indicated their
similarity and distributions of N-glycosylation sites. Further potential sialic acid or galactose affinity domains have
been described in the S-protein by docking analysis. Molecular dynamic simulation for the glycosylated complexus
of S-protein-ACE2 implied that the complicate viral binding of receptor-binding domain may be influenced by
peripheric N-glycans from own and adjacent monoers. These works will contribute to investigate the N-glycosylation
in S-protein and explain the highly contagious of COVID-19.

Intrudction
Recent COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) caused by a novel coronavirus named Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) has been spread fastly all over the world. Higher lethality and powerful
human-to-human transmission capacity has aroused widely concern. As a kind of enveloped virus with singlestranded positive-sensed RNA, new SARS2 CoV (Coronavirus) is a member of CoV family, which has closer
relationship to previous SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome)
CoVs [1,2].
Coronaviruses are cataloged into the Nidovirales, Cornidovirineae, Orthocoronavirinae and divided into four
Genuses. Until now, the Alpha-coronavirus and Beta-coronavirus response to known human-isolated CoVs
(HCoVS), including the above three CoVs combined with HKU1, OC43, NL63 and 229E HCoVs. According to
phylogenetic analysis, these HCoVs are considered to have originated from the bats and rodents [3-5]. The genomes
of coronaviruses have been described meticulously in previous reports. As one of biggest viruses, the 5’-terminal of
positive-sense and single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) genome in coronavirus encodes a polyprotein complexus, pp1ab,
while the 3’-terminal encodes the structural proteins, such as the envelope glycoprotein spike protein (S-protein),
envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and possible hemagglutinin-esterase (HE)[6-7].
The clove homotrimeric S-protein is a type Ⅰ glycoprotein which gives the crown-like appearance on CoVs.
The S1 and S2 subunits in S-protein monomer, are responsible for cell binding and membrane fusion, respectively
[8].

The S1 subunit forms the globular head and contains the N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor binding domain

(RBD) and smaller subdomains (SD1 and SD2). The S2 subunit is conserved among all coronaviruses and forms the
main rosette-like α-helix bundle and a β-sheets-riched subdomain. In the endosome, the S2 could be further cleaved
by the host proteases and exposed its fusion peptide, which resulting in final membrane fusion [9-10].
The receptor of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) for SARS CoV and DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase 4)
for MERS CoV have been reported [11-12]. However, the S-protein is highly glycosylated, as many as 22 potential Nglycosylation sites in the S-protein of SARS CoV could be detected, compared to 23 N-glycosylation sites in the Sprotein of MERS CoV

[13-14].

Therefore, it is worth to figure out the distribution of N-glycosylation sites and

glycobiology functions in the S-protein of SARS2 CoV.
In this article, we have compared the evolutionary relationship and distribution of N-glycosylation sites in
different CoVs. For the distribution and possible functions in the N-glycosylation sites, a homologous modeling
method had been adopted. Further docking analysis have provided a visual method for the possible glycan binding
domains. These works should contribute to explan the highly contagious of new SARS2 CoV and provide new
strategy on SARS2 CoV prevention.

1 Methods
1.1 Phylogenetic analysis for S protein and N-glycosylation sites
For the purpose of the evolution of S-protiens and N-glycosylation sites in CoVs, a dataset of S-protein
sequences from representative 1169 CoVs was retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) VIRUS database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus, accessed in April.15th 2020), containing
approximately 438 human reports in 1023 sequences[15]. An alignment of whole sequences was performed by
ClustalW 2.0 in MEGA 7.0 (File S1)[16]. A webtool named “NetNGlyc 1.0 Server” was used for the N-glycosylation
sites predicting[17]. To investigate the evolutionary relationship of N-glycosylation sites in different subgenus, a
smaller dataset was used for further analysis with 49 representative sequences, including the HKU1, OC43, NL63,
229E, SARS, MERS as well as SARS2 CoVs. Unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed using the NeighborJoining method and the Poisson correction model. The internal branching probabilities were determined by bootstrap
analysis with 1,000 replicates similar to previous description[18].

1.2 Homologous modeling for S-protein of SARS2 CoV
As the SARS2 CoV continued to spread across the world, more and more viral complete genomes were
sequenced, as well as the crystal structures of S-proteins. However, the available structures are lock of partial
peripheral elements[19]. Hence, the amino acid sequence from one S-protein (Genebank ID: QHN73810.1) was
selected for homologous modeling by SWISS-MODEL web service[20]. As a result, a 3D structure file of S-protein
with the largest similarity of 99.9 % to a reported S-protein of SARS2 CoV (PDB ID: 6VSB) was created[21]. For
the structural optimization, a 10 ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulation has been adopted. Minimization and
equilibration were performed using the NAMD 2.8 program with the CHARMM22 all-atom force field for the
protein as previous describing[22].

1.3 Molecular docking analysis for Glycan ligands candidates and S-proteins
In order to assess the possible glycan-binding ability of S-protein of SARS2 CoV from the virtual calculated
perspective, a serial of glyco-ligands were designed, including the monosaccharides (The Man (Mannose), Gal
(Galactose), Glu (Glucose),GalNAc (N-acetyl-β-D-Galactosamine), GlcNAc (N-Acetyl-β-D-Glucosamine), Xly
(Xylose), Fuc (Fucose) and SA (Sialic Acid)), and common terminal structures at the N-glycans, such as the
disaccharides (G3GN(Galβ-1,3GlcNAc),G4GN (Galβ-1,4GlcNAc), GN2M (GlcNAcβ-1,2Man), GN4M (GlcNAcβ1,4Man), SA23Gal (SAα-2,3Gal), SA26Gal (SAα-2,6Gal)). The Blood group antigens (Blood group A(Fucα1,2Gal[β-1,4GlcNAc]β-1,3GalNAc), Blood group B antigens (Fucα-1,2Gal[β-1,4GlcNAc]β-1,3Gal), Blood group
o antigens (Fucα-1,2Galβ-1,4GlcNAc) and other comparative saccharides such as the X2X (Xylβ-1,2Xyl), G4G
(Glcβ-1,4Glc), X4X4X4X (Xylβ-1,4Xylβ-1,4Xylβ-1,4Xyl), MMM (Manα-3,6Manα-3,6Man), 3-sialyllactose (SAα2,3Galβ-1,4Glc), 6-sialyllactose (SAα-2,6Galβ-1,4Glc), Disialyllacto-N-tetraose (DSLNT). All of the glyco-ligands
were constructed by the online SWEET-Ⅱ program and optimized by the MM3 force field[23] .
The S-protein model of SARS2 after MD simulation was subjected to docking analysis. The automated docking
analysis between S-protein and glyco-ligands was performed using the AutoDock Vina program. A grid box with
size of 70 × 70 × 70 points grid box was used to cover the mainly top surface of S-protein monomer during the
docking analysis. The receptor atom positions were held fixed, and the glycosidic bonds of saccharides were variable.
Other docking parameters were set to default [24]. As the contrast, the S-proteins from SARS (PDB ID:6ACC), MERS
(PDB ID: 5W9J), NL63(PDB ID: 5SZS), MHV CoVs (PDB ID: 3JCL), were selected for the same procedures.

1.4 The N-glycan analysis in the S-protein-ACE2 interaction
To figure out whether N-glycans from both S-protein and ACE2 impact the receptor-ligands interaction, the
further MD simulation for glycosylated ACE2-S-protein complex were performed based on the reported coordinated
file (ACE2-NTD: 6M0J; Up-stand stated S-protein: 6VSB). The ACE2-NTD PDB file, which contains the ACE2
and incomplete S1 subunit was subsequently superposed by the optimized SARS2 model and up-started S-protein
respectively. The “complex” type N-glycans, were added on all N-glycosylated sites by “glycoprotein builder”
program in GLYCAM online server[25]. An NVT ensemble (canonicalensemble) and a revised force-field file for
glycoprotein (File S2) was used in the MD simulation for these complexus, further distance analysis for the
fluctuations of N-glycans was adopts by VMD1.9.3[22]. Five pairs between the geometric center of one GCD1 to the
terminal SA and Gal residues, the inner Man, GlcNAc residues and glutamic acid residues from N90 in ACE2 were
selected for possible interaction assesssing. The distance of “GCD1-N90, GCD1-GlcNAc, GCD1-MAN, GCD1-Gal
and GCD1-SA” were sampled every 100 ps during 10 ns MD simulation.

2 Results
2.1 The pholygenic analysis of the S-proteins in CoVs
There are four genuses in Orthocoronavirinae, included the Alpha-, Beta-, Delta- and Gamma-coronaviruses.

The Betacoronavirus genus could be further divided into the Embecovirus, Hibecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirus,
Sarbecovirus and others subgenuses[26][25]. Unlike the continuous-spreading the IVs (Influenza Viruses) and HIVs
(Human Immunodeficiency Viruses), most of records were derived from outbreak epidemic CoVs, while their amino
acid sequences are relative conservative.
Based on the genome similarity, the emerging SARS2 CoV showed the minimal difference to the BAT SARSlike CoV (e.g. Genebank ID:AVP78042.1, within 99% sequences similarity) and clustered in the Sarbevirus
subgenus[27]. Up to 25th June 2020, more than 90 SARS2 CoV genomes have been included in the NCBI database.
The similarity of the S-protein amino acid reaches up to 99.9% and few residues are mutated in 1273 amino acid
full-length (e.g. H49Y and S247R mutations. The numbering system of S-protein of SARS2 CoV was in keeping
with an easier reported sequence. Genebank ID: QHN73810.1)[28]).
The genome of CoVs varies from 28 k to 31 k bp (base-pair), and the length of S-protein differs from 1100 to
1500 aa (amino acid. e.g. 1457 aa in Canine coronavirus, Genebank ID: BAW32706.1). Up to 1th June, nine CoVs
have the more than 100 records. The SARS2 (4130 records), SARS (303), MERS (734), OC43 (291), BCoV (245)

CoVs (101) in Delta-coronavirus as well as other representative CoVs are selected for further analysis.
The N-J tree of S-protein derived from the MEGA7 is similar to those from the whole-genome researches
(Figure 1A)[29]. But the sequence similarity of various S-proteins, even within the Betacoronaviruses, is rather low.
The homology of S-protein from Sarbecovirus subgenus, which included the Bat SARS-like, SARS and SARS2
CoVs in a 338 analytical dataset, reaches up to 57.8%, and most conserved residues distribute at the C-terminal (File
S3).

2.2 Comparing the structures of S-protein
Up to now, the reported S-protein structures of SARS2 CoV are partial missing, such as the peripheral elements
at the NTD (e.g. PDB ID:6X29, 6VSB). The “SWISS-MODEL” provided one proper method for the S-protein reconstruction. Based on the existing structures, the created model has an identity of 99.7% to a reported S-protein
from SARS2 CoV[30]. After a 10 ns MD simulation for S-protein, the optimal model was used for structural
comparation to those from PEDV (PDB ID: 6U7K) in Alpha-coronaviruses, SARS, MERS, and MHV (Mouse
hepatitis virus, PDB ID: 6VSJ) in Beta-coronaviruses, HKU15 (Porcine coronavirus HKU15, 6B7N) in Deltacoronavirus and IBV (PDB ID: 6CV0) in Gamma-coronavirus, all S-proteins share the similar structural
characteristics but with larger differences in the S1 subunit, which is in accord with above sequence analysis (Figure
S1).
Three S-protein monomers twist together and form the obconic (or clove shape) trimmer, while each monomer
consists of global S1 and stalk S2 subunit (Figure 2A). Similar to the description from other coronaviruses, in SARS2
CoV, the S1 subunit can be divided into the NTD (N-terminal domain,1-290), RBD (Receptor-Binding Domain,
330-528), SD1 (subdomain1, 320-329 and 530-590.) and SD2 (subdomain2, 309-322 and 589-653) in order[31]. The
stalk S2 subunit participates in the virus-host membrane fusion and consists of conserved bunches of α-helixes (7281069). In addition, a third subdomain named SD3, as well as the TM (Transmembrane) and CP (Cytoplasmic tail),
at the C-terminal (1070-1273), are partial avaible in all identified structures.
As is shown in Figure 2B, NTD from SARS2 CoV are located at the triangular angles. A typical β-sandwich
core structure co-exists in all S-proteins, which is consisted of one 5-stranded β-sheet and one 6-stranded β-sheet in
SARS2 CoV[32] . A smaller helix element (291-308) co-exists in all S-proteins and responsible for NTD and RBD
connecting. The RBD has been described detailedly in different CoVs, such as the ﬂexible RBD of SARS and SARS2
CoVs are readily recognized by its receptor with either lying and Up-standing state[33,34]. The precise coordinate files
of RBD-ACE2 interaction compleuxs from both SARS and SARS2 CoVs had been reported. We found that a Tyr-

riched region at the interactive interface of RBD was also relative conserved in other Beta-coronaviruses (Figure
S2). Noteworthy, only one RBD in S-Protein of SARS and SARS2 participate in the ACE2 binding, and the
mechanism needs further study[35]. Two smaller β-sheets-riched SD1 and SD2 appear to be the base to underpin the
NTD and RBD. Interestingly, these subdomains are composed of two discrete sequences (Figure 2C). The S1 and
S2 subunits are linked by the S1/S2 cleavage site, and “RRAR” motif in SARS2 CoV is regarded as the furin
recognition site, rather than fewer basic residues in other coronaviruses[36]. The rosette-like S2 subunits are consisted
of bunches of α-helixes which can be further devided into smaller helix elements. Moreover, it can be inferred that
uncompleted SD3 is rich of β-sheets.

2.3 N-glycosylation sites in S-proteins of SARS2 CoV
S-proteins are highly N-glycosylated, commonly, as many as 20 potential N-glycosites can be detected from
different CoVs. There are 22 potential N-linked glycosites in the S-protein of SARS2 CoV, while SARS-CoV and
Bat SARS CoV possess 22 and 23 glycosites respectively (Figure1B). In all CoVs, the numbers and distribution of
sites is not closely related to the genuses. As is shown in Figure 1B, the N-glycosylated sites of representative CoVs
mainly cluster in the S1 subunit and the C-terminal of S2 subunit. Although the length of S-protein is different, the
distribution of N-glycosylate sites is similar. However, unlike the continual IVs and HIVs, which contain abundant
emerging or missing N-glycosylation sites, most glycosites in CoVs are conserved[18].
It is well-known that, the N-X-S/T (X can not be Pro residue) sequon is the motif for N-glycosylation. In SARS2
CoV, eight potential N-glycosites distribute in NTD (including N17, N61, N74, N122, N149, N165, N234 and N282).
It reflects that the NTD is under continual host immune surveillance, while N-glycans may shield the epitopes. Only
one N-glycosite, N343, locates at the top of RBD and near to the geometric center of the trimerical top. Another Nglycosite, N331 is at the linker of RBD and SD1, followed by N603, N616 and N657 in SD2. A long linker region
connects the S2 cleavage site to the long upstream helix (UH). N709 is near to the S1/S2 protease cleavage site, and
highly conserved in ases[37]. Another similar N-glycosite, N801, may participate in the protection of the S1/S2’
protease cleavage site. The rest of N-glycosites, including N717, N1074, N1098, N1134 and invisible N1158, N1173,
N1194 in SD3 locate at the bottom of S-proteins (Figure 2C).

2.4 The glycan-recognition domains in the S-protein of SARS2 CoV.
The crystal structures of RBD-ACE2 complexus had been reported from the lastest works[38,39]. We found that
eight-Tyr residues in the RBD form the unbond-interactions with the N-terminal helix fo ACE2Error! Reference
source not found.. By comparing this interactive region to other CoVs, most of Tyr residues are conserved in
Serbevirus subgenus (Figure S2)[40]. Although protein-protein interactions are also reported in other CoVs, such as
the DDP4-MERS or CEACAM1a-MHV[41], in view of present works, glycan-protein recognization is also universal
in viral invasion, such as the sialic acids (SA) residue bind to Hemagglutinin in Type A IVs[42], the N-acetyl-9-Oacetylneuraminic acid binds to HE (Hemagglutinin-Esterase) in Type C IVs, the S-protein of HKU1 or BCoV[43].
Hence, an explorative work on the potential glycan-recognition domains (GCDs) in S-protein of SARS2 has been
took by using docking analysis.
Five different S-proteins had docked with a series of glyco-ligands, which included common sialoglycan ligands
(SA, SA23Gal, SA26Gal, 3-sialyllactose and 6-sialyllactose.), gal-related lignds (Gal, SA23Gal, SA26Gal, G3GN
and G4GN) and others (monosaccharides such as the Glc, Xyl or the X4X4X4X and MMM.). As listed in the Figure
3, the binding energies derived from Autodock Vina results indicate different binding abilities of these S-proteins
by theoretical calculation. The lowest binding energy (best binding ability) comes from the NL63-3-sialyllactose (9.4 Kcal/mol) while the highest from the SARS2-X4X4X4X and NL63-Fuc (-4.2 kcal/mol). Taken together,
sialoglycan and Gal related-glycans showed higher binding energies to SARS2 model. In view of different blood
type, the S-protein of SARS2 did not show obvious preference to these Gal- and GalNAc- terminal blood group

antigens. These results may reveal the S-proteins binding preferences.
The ADT provides the visual methods for observing the receptor-ligand interactions. In these docking assays,
three possible glycan-recognized domains (GCDs) with higher binding ability could be concluded in the S-protein
of SARS2 CoV. These potential GCDs are close to the NTD and surrounded by peripheral small helix, β-sheet or
Loop. As is shown in Figure 4, first potential GCD (GCD1, red region), which appears at the top of NTD, has showed
stronger affinity to SA-related and Gal-related glycans. It locates at the top of β-sandwich core and constitues of one
smaller helix, two samller β-sheets and long loops. The crucial residues, E155, V157, K115 and V113 on the bottom
β-sheets and the Y146, W138 at the Helix140 participate the H-bonds formation in the binding pocket. The SA
residues in sialoglycans, as well as the Gal residues in Gal-related saccharides, adopt lying conformation and form
the H-bonds with peripheric residues. Similar to the NTDs from other CoVs, a typital β-sandwich core structure in
SARS2 CoV consisting of one 5-stranded β-sheet and one 6-stranded β-sheet (Figure S3)[32]. Previous studies hinted
NTD in MHV or OC43 CoV have affinity to N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid, and their NTD showed high
similarity to human galactose-binding lectin domain (e.g. Galectin-4. PDB ID: 5DUU)[44], which also contain
peripheral structural elements, mostly long loops and short-sheets, on top of the core structure (Figure 4C).
The GCD2 locates at the trimerical outermost angles (Cyan) and shows higher binding affinity to most
sialoglycans, especially to the SA23GAL. This domain is consisted of the Loop10, Loop250 and Helix150, while
the V16, S254 and E154 may play the key roles in receptor-ligand interaction (Figure 4D). Interestingly, this domain
have also been discussed in other CoVs such as the MHV, OC43 and NL63 CoVs[45-47].
Parts of sialoglycans, like SA26GAL in MERS, also show higher affinity to the GCD3 (Blue). This domain
locates between the GCD1 and GCD2. The key residues in GCD3, like T109, D111, K113 and R457, are distinctive
in SARS2 CoV, where one miss N-glycosylation sites (N254S) also can be found in either SARS or Bat-like SARS
CoVs (Figure 4 E,F).
However, all docking tests were performed without consideration of N-glycosylation. It is worth nothing that
one or more N-glycosylation sites located at the edge the above GCDs. Such as the N165 in GCD1, N18 and N74 in
GCD2.

2.5 N-glycan Effects of S-protein and ACE2 interaction
Previous studies in SARS CoV had elaborated the binding mechanism between the S-proteins and ACE2. Only
one “up” RBD in trimeric S-protein binds ACE2 molecular by using a protruding up conformation[48,49]. More than
eight Tyr residues in RBD participated in the nonbonded interaction with the N-terminal helix of ACE2. This Tyrriched region locates at the top of trimmer and faces to the outside, which is consisted of two bands β-sheets bottom
and surround loops. Given the structural similarity of S-protein between SARS and SARS2 CoVs, it seems likely
that the similar binding mechanism also occurs in the SARS2 CoV, while the emrging F489Y mutation also increase
its binding affinity (Figure S2). Acturally, the latest researches from the complexus of ACE2 and RBD in SARS2
CoV verified this hypothesis [30,33,34].
However, the N-glycosylation in this complicated interaction is usually neglected. ACE2 is also highly
glycosylated, including six N-glycosylation sites and possible O-glycosylated region[50]. The incomplete ACE2RBD complexus in PDB database also denotes that five N-glycosylation sites (N53, N90, N103, N322, N546) in
ACE2 distribute around the interactive interface (PDB ID: 7BZ5, 6M17, 6M0J, 6LZG, 7BWJ, 7C01, 6VW1 and so
on.)[51,52]. Acturally, as many as fourteen N-glycosylation sites, including five in ACE2, two in RBD (N343, N331)
and eight in nearby monomer (N122, N165, 2*N234, N331, 2* N343), distribute surround the interactive interface
(< 50 Å, Figure S4). Among of these, N322, N90, N122 in ACE2, and N165 in RBD with the distance to the RBD
center shorter than 30 Å.
As observed from the existing ACE2-RBD complexs derived from SARS or SARS2 CoVs, we found that the
N-terminal helix of ACE2 laying on the RBD and orienting to the adjacent NTD. This would result the N-glycan at

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.01.406025; this version posted December 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this

the N90 of ACE2 appear on the adjacent NTD and the terminal residues of N-glycan interact with the GCD1 directly
(Figure 5). By considering the SA- and Gal- affinity of GCD1, whether an unknown recognition mechanism may
promote the ACE2-S-protein binding aroused our interest.
In order to discuss the influence of N-glycans in ACE2-RBD interaction, glycosylated ACE2-S-protein
complex was built by the GLYPROT online serve. Based on N-Glycosylation researches, the “complex type” Nglycans were added to the N-glycosites in ACE2 and S-protein. The distance analysis from the “GCD1-N90, GCD1GlcNAc, GCD1-MAN, GCD1-Gal and GCD1-SA” pairs also indicated the close contact between the N-glycan and
one GCD1. During the 10 ns MD simulation, the N-glycans swing around their glycosites and the terminal residues
in N-glycans fluncated more flexible. By overlapping the RBD of RBD-ACE2 complex to the same domain of Sprotein trimer by either laying or standing conformation, Obviously, the N-glycans from the N90 of ACE2 may
contact the GCD1 frequently. It hints that during the viral invasion, the dual binding mechanism may exist in the
ACE2-S-Protein interaction, multi Tyr residues may form stronger nonbonded interaction while weaker binding
affinity from the Gal- or SA-terminal of N-glycan to NTD may enhance this binding ability.

3 Discussion
3.1 The distribution of N-glycosylation sites in coronaviruses
Glycosylation plays an important role in the viral life cycle, and N-glycosylation is necessary for viral envelope
glycoproteins, such as the nascent glycoprotein folding, maturation, or degradation, escaping host immune
surveillance, regulating the sensitivity to temperature adaption, protection of cleavage sites, even impacting
pathogen-host interaction[53]. As the most striking protein in CoVs, S-protein is one of glycoproteins (M-protein is
another glycosylated protein, which possess one to six conserved N-glycosylation sites in different CoVs and
consisted of 1100-1400 amino acids, File S4.)
Seldom glycoprotein contains so many N-glycosylation sites like S-protein, while 39 glycositescan be found in
the S-protein of NL63 CoV (NCBI GENEID: AWK59943.1). It is can be concluded that more than one hundred of
N-glycans in this trimer S-protein and the mass glycans surround membrane matrix. Previous works on IVs have
found that most of N-glycosylation sites in the N-terminal of HA (or HA1) varied largely in different subtypes, while
the glycosites in stem HA2 domain are highly conserved, this is similar to S-protein. Analogously, the sequence
similarity of CoVs in different genues is lower, but their global structures are conserved. As many as 20 glycosites
can be detected in different S-protein monomer, while most of N-glycosites scatter at the S1 subunit and 6 to 8
conserved N-glycosites cluster at the C-terminal. Large differences of glycosites exist among four genuses, even
inside the Betacoronavirus genus. By comparing the glycosites in Sarbecovirus subgenus, both 22 glycosites cound
be found in SARS and SARS2 CoV, while 23 glycosites in BAT SARS-like CoV (File S4).
Although there are numerous N-glycosylation sites in S-protein, but whether they are all glycosylated? Kelley
WM et al. pointed that the nascent 14-sugar glycan transferred to the N-X-T/S sequon in endoplasmic reticulum
firstly, subsequent glycan processing is along with the peptide folding[54]. Actually, the S-proteins included in the
PDB database also verified the highly glycosylated. The GlcNAc residue at the Asn spread all over the surface of Sprotein (e.g. MERS (PDB ID: 5W9P), SARS (PDB ID: 5X58) or SARS2 CoVs (PDB ID: 5W9P)), which is the
feature of the N-glycan cleavaged by the PNGase[55,56]. What’s more, LC/MS provided the exact N-glycan structures
at 9 glycosites from NTD of IBV in Parsons’ works, including the “high-mannose”, “complex” and “hybrid”
glycans[57]. The deletion of 6 glycosites results the losing of binding ability. These results are consistent with the Nglycosylation in SARS CoV[58]. According to the latest analysis, both N-glycans isolated from SARS and SARS2
CoVs are similar, namely including “high mannose”, “hybrid”, “complex” N-glycans. Interestingly, the
oligomannose-type glycans were abundant at the bottom of S-protein and the N234 which near to the RBD binding
domain.Across the 22 N-linked glycosylation sites, 16% of the glycans contain at least one SA residue and 48% are
fucosylated[59].

In this study, S-protein is roughly divided into NTD, RBD, SD1, SD2, Helix-Bundles and SD3 from the N- to
C-terminal. N-glycosylation sites scatter in the external surface, while no sites can be found in the embedded αhelixes bundle. The conserved N-glycosites hint that they may protect the important regions, or mutations in the
RBD or cleavage sites can lead to zoonotic spillover and alteration of cell/tissue tropism, as exemplified by MERS
and SARS CoVs. By analyzing their location in S-protein, the functionsof N-glycosylation sites mainly involve in:
1) Protein folding, 2) Protecting the antigen sites, 3) Protecting the S1/S2 cleavage site, 4) Protecting the C-terminal
tail, 5) Affecting the receptor-ligand interaction[60].

3.2 Glycan-binding participate in host invasion
Binding to host ligand is the earliest step during viral invading. The RBD (DPP4 for MERS CoV; ACE2 for
SARS and SARS2 CoVs, 9-O-Ac-SA for OC43, HKU1 HCoVs, ANPEP (also known as CD13) for 229E CoV), or
NTD (CEACAM1b for MHV CoV) of S protein on the surface of CoV bind to the receptor on the cell surface to
facilitate the virus entering the host cell[61]. Therefore, whether an unknown glycan-binding mechanism participate
in the SARS2 CoV interaction during invading remains unknown.
Previous studies from different CoVs have pointed out the glycan-binding is important for the
enteropathogenicity[62]. What is more, the NTD of MHV, BCoV or OC43 CoV contain the same fold as human
galectin domains, but with different binding ability. It also has described that the SA-binding domains located at the
top of NTD, which consisted of β-sheets and two loops (Equal to the GCD1 in this study)[32]. Ruben’s work
indicated this region was conserved in OC43-related family. The E182, W184, H185 and Y162 residues play the
crucial roles in the SA-binding while the R143H, K181V, L186W, and I145T mutation didn’t alter the SA-binding
ability[63]. In addition, a series of SA-related saccharides (including SA23Gal, SA26Gal, 3-sialyllactose or 6sialyllactose) in the S-protein coordinations reveal MERS CoV adopt another strategy for SA binding (Similar to
the GCD2 in this study). This SA binding domain located at the triangular tip of S-protein, which consisted of
peripheral loops and small helixes. Obviously, the carboxyl group with S133, the hydroxyl groups at the C8,C9
atoms with K307, A92 as well as the Q36, I32 with the amide group form the multiple non-bonding interactions[64].
Regardless of N-glyans, we speculated three potential GCDs in S-protein of SARS2 CoV by docking analysis,
while two of three are similar to the above description. GCD1 lcateted at the top of NTD, which is consisted of one
smaller helix, two samller β-sheets and long loops. Importantly, this domain showed either higher affinity to SA- or
Gal- related glycans. Given the structural similarity between the NTD of SARS2, OC43, MERS or Galectin, it’s not
hard to explain the affinity to Gal-related ligands of GCD1. Two loops and one helix of GCD2 formed a hydrophobic
pocket, and V16, S254 and E154 are also conserved in Sarbecovirus subgenus. Similar location like the GCD3 in
other CoVs has not been reported yet, we concluded this domain which locatedat the big groove of S-Protein side
may be blocked by the nearby five N-glycans from the NTD, SD1, RBD and another nearby RBD. Although docking
analysis provide powerful methods for ligands-receptor interaction, but the disadventages cannot be omitted, e.g. the
docking is set to be occurred in the vaccum[65].
In this study, the SA-related glycans has shown higher binding ability to these GCDs, it reflects the S-protein
of SARS2 may have the potential ability for SA-binding. However, up to now, there are few validity reports from
the anti-neuraminidase therapy. The SA-binding ability also could be proved by hemagglutination, such as the
envelope glycoproteins from the paramyxoviridae, orthomyxoviridae or bunyaviridae[66-68]. Interestingly, there is
another SA cleavaging enzyme, HE, in the confirmed SA-binding CoVs but missed in the SARS or SARS2 CoVs[6970].

Though these indications may not support the SA-binding functions in the emerging SARS2 CoV. Considering

the N-glycosylation is highly complicated, this protein-glycan interaction may be influenced by many factors.
More significantly, the GCD1 also showed higher affinity to Gal-related glycans, especially to the Galβ13GlcNAc structures. In our previous works of human saliva protein, the Galβ1-3GlcNAc-terminal structure was
gradually accumulated along with chronic disease, such as the type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension or

hepatocirrhosis[71] . It may help to explain that higher lethality in chronic patients due to dual binding mechanism.

3.3 N-glycosylation affects the host invasion in SARS2 CoV
CoVs use quite diverse strategies for interaction with cells involving the recognition of either specific protein
receptors or certain derivatives of saccharides. Although the molecular mechanism of host-virus interaction in
different CoVs have been described meticulously, however, the highly glycosylation in these interactions were
commonly neglected.
Similar to S-protein, the HA in IVs and the gp160 in HIVs are the homotrimers and contain two subunits, e.g.
the HA1 and HA2, gp120 and gp40 respectively[72]. It is well known that the SA-HA interaction play the crucial role
in IVs, and the N-glycans at two N-glycosylation sites of HA even affect the host preference in H5N1 virus[22,42].
Considering the highly glycosylated in S-protein, it is not difficult to infer the viral invasion is affected by N-glycans
directly or indirectly. As we point out, more than eight N-glycosylation sites distribute within a 50 Å radius of the
center of ACE2-S-protein in SARS2 CoV (Figure S4), similar situations prevail in other CoV. Both 22 Nglycosylation sites could be found in S-protein monomer, 20 of 22 possess similar locations. The emerging Nglycosylation sites include the N149 in NTD and N657 near to S1/S2 cleavage site, while the miss N112 (N112S,
equal to the N109 in SARS CoV) and N370 (T372A mutation in NSA result in the deletion of N-glycosylation site,
equal to N357 in SARS CoV) are quite close to the RBD binding interface (Figure S5). The miss glycosylation sites
near to the RBD result in a bigger exposed region and facilate the ACE2 binding during the viral invasion.
Additionally, there are also more than ten N-glycosylation sites distribute around the binding interfaces from MHVmCEACAM1a, MERS-DPP4 or others (Figure S6).
In previous analysis, we proposed several potential GCDs in the S-protein of SARS2 CoV, and the glycanbinding ability of the GCD to the N-glycan of ACE2 may facilitate the infection of host cells. During the SARS2
invasion, the RBD of S-protein bond to the N-terminal helix of ACE2, meanwhile, the N-glycan terminal (especially
the SA and GalNAc residues) at N90 of ACE2 is apt to bind the GCD1 in S-protein, which may trigger the follwing
conformational change of S-protein trimer. This hypothesis needs to be further verified.

4 Conclusion
The emerging SARS2 CoV results in tens of millions of infections and hundreds of thousands death in just a
few months, the very contagious is higher than the known CoVs and attribute to the high affinity of its S-protein.
This study has elaborated the distribution and functions of N-glycosylation sites in CoVs, as well as the potential
GCDs in S-protein of SARS2 CoV. The high density of N-glycans surround the RBD-ACE2 interaction interface
might suggest the dual binding mechanism, i.e. protein-protein interaction (RBD-ACE2) and glycan-protein
interaction (N-glycan-GCD1) interactions. These results will help to explain the highly contagious of COVID-19.

between 2 to 15 Å. It hinted that another possible glycan-protein binding mechanism may exist in the SARS2
invasion.
