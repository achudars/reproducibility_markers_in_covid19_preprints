ABSTRACT
COVID-19 disease has had a relatively less severe impact in Africa. To understand the role of
SARS CoV2 mutations on COVID-19 disease in Africa, we analysed 282 complete nucleotide
sequences from African isolates deposited in the NCBI Virus Database. Sequences were
aligned against the prototype Wuhan sequence (GenBank accession: NC_045512.2) in BWA
v. 0.7.17. SAM and BAM files were created, sorted and indexed in SAMtools v. 1.10 and
marked for duplicates using Picard v. 2.23.4. Variants were called with mpileup in BCFtools
v. 1.11. Phylograms were created using Mr. Bayes v 3.2.6. A total of 2,349 single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) profiles across 294 sites were identified. Clades associated with severe
disease in the United States, France, Italy, and Brazil had low frequencies in Africa
(L84S=2.5%, L3606F=1.4%, L3606F/V378I/=0.35, G251V=2%). Sub Saharan Africa (SSA)
accounted for only 3% of P323L and 4% of Q57H mutations in Africa. Comparatively low
infections in SSA were attributed to the low frequency of the D614G clade in earlier samples
(25% vs 67% global). Higher disease burden occurred in countries with higher D614G
frequencies (Egypt=98%, Morocco=90%, Tunisia=52%, South Africa) with D614G as the first
confirmed case. V367F, D364Y, V483A and G476S mutations associated with efficient ACE2
receptor binding and severe disease were not observed in Africa. 95% of all RdRp mutations
were deaminations leading to CpG depletion and possible attenuation of virulence. More
genomic and experimental studies are needed to increase our understanding of the temporal

INTRODUCTION
SARS CoV2 virus is a positive-sense single stranded RNA(+ssRNA) coronavirus responsible
for the covid-19 pandemic (Asghari et al., 2020). Since the initial isolation and genomic
characterization of SARS CoV2 in January 2020, numerous mutation studies have tracked the
evolution of the virus globally (Chaw et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020; Koyama et al., 2020;
Mishra et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; van Dorp et al., 2020). Mutation studies are important
as they reveal important information about the temporal evolution of the virus, reveal suitable
targets for drug, diagnostics, and vaccine design, and reveal hot spots that may undermine
successful therapeutic and vaccine interventions (Kayla et al., 2018; Perales et al., 2011).
Mutation studies also help track changes in the infectivity and virulence of mutants, reveal new
strains with possible implications on immune escape and provide important clinicoepidemiological data (Abdullahi et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Pachetti et al., 2020; Xi et al.,
2020; Zou et al., 2020).
Studies have since shown that SARS CoV2 is a moderately mutating virus with a median
mutation rate of 1.12 × 10−3 mutations per site-year (95% CI, CI: 9.86 × 10−4 to 1.85 × 10−4)
(95% CI: 4.8 to 5.52) (Koyama et al., 2020). This moderate mutation rate is lower than that of
other +ssRNA viruses and this is attributable to the presence of a 3’-5’ exonuclease that
provides proof-reading ability (Duffy et al., 2018; Minskaia et al., 2006).
Mutation studies have also distinguished viral SARS CoV2 clades and mapped dominant
strains. The six major SARS CoV2 clades include D614G or basal, L84S, L3606F, D448del
and G392D. D614G was first seen in China and is now the dominant strain worldwide (Korber
et al., 2020). The shift to the D614G variant occurs even in areas where the wild type strain is
established and is due to the increased fitness of the mutant over the wild type (Korber et al.,
2020).

Viral entry of SARS Cov2 is facilitated by cleavage of the SARS CoV2 S protein. The D614G
mutation more efficiently facilitates its cleavage by the host serine protease elastase-2 and this
explains the high infectivity of D614G (Hu et al., 2020). Increased infectivity of D614G is
supported by in vitro experimental studies showing elevated RNA levels and higher viral titers
in clinical samples with the D614G mutation and D614G mutant pseudoviruses respectively
(Hu et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020; Lorenzo-Redondo et al., 2020; Ozono et al., 2020; Wagner
et al., 2020). However, there’s no conclusive evidence to show that the variant is associated
with more severe disease or increased hospitalizations (Wagner et al., 2020). Even so, the
D614G strain has co-evolved with other mutations such as (F106F), 14408 C->T (P323L), 241
C->T, 25563 G->T (Q57H), and 1059 C-> T(T85I) and more studies are required to clarify the
impact of these mutations on virulence.
The D614G mutation is situated on the B cell epitope in a region that is highly
immunodominant and this may possibly undermine vaccine effectiveness. However,
experimental studies suggest that D614G mutants are sensitive to neutralization by polyclonal
convalescent serum (Korber et al., 2020).
Subclades of D614G include D614G/Q57H/ and D614G/Q57H/T265I which were first
identified

in

France,

D614G/203_204delinsKR

first

identified

in

Germany and

D614G/203_204delinsKR/T175M first identified in Iceland and Portugal (Koyama et al.,
2020). The L84S clade was first observed in China and has one subclade namely L84S/P5828L
that was first observed in the United States. The L3606F clade was also first observed in China
and has the L3606F/V378I/ subclade first observed in Italy and the L3606F/G251V/ subclade
observed in Brazil. Other subclades are D448del which was first observed in France and
G392D which was first observed in Germany. In general, there’s high affinity between US and
European samples with little similarity with East Asian samples and European clades dominate
in samples in US (Koyama et al., 2020).

Mutations studies have also revealed the mechanisms of SARS CoV2 mutations. Dominant
mutations are C->T transitions (Chaw et al., 2020; Koyama et al., 2020; Mishra et al., 2020).
Depletion of CpG dinucleotides is also a common mutation mechanism in SARS CoV2.
Increased CG dinucleotide levels are inversely correlated with viral fitness, defined by
decreased virulence and replication. Thus, CpG depletion is defined as an immune escape
strategy to evade host antiviral mechanisms. (Theys et al., 2018). Depletion of CpG
dinucleotides in SARS CoV2 is possibly mediated by human zinc finger antiviral protein
(hZAP) and apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme (APOBEC1 and APOEBC3a). The hZAP
attach to CpG dinucleotides in viral genomes to inhibit the replication of viruses and mediate
the degradation of viral genome (Nchioua et al., 2020; Takata et al., 2017; Meagher et al.,
2019; Trus et al., 2020). APOBEC1 and APOBEC3a deplete CpG dinucleotides in RNA
viruses by mediating cytidine-to-uridine (C → T) changes (Xia, 2020; DiGeorgio et al, 2020).
In comparative terms, Africa has had lower covid-19 morbidity and mortality numbers. This is
a striking observation especially when the vulnerabilities associated with weak or nonexistent
health systems, poor sanitation, high HIV prevalence, and high poverty rates in Africa are taken
into account (Anim & Ofor-Asenso, 2020; de Aranzabal et al., 2020; Patel et al., 2020). Despite
this observation, and to the best of our knowledge, there have been no mutation studies focused
on genomes sequenced from samples collected in Africa that seek to understand the evolution
of this disease in Africa.
In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 282 samples collected in Africa in
order to characterize the genetic variants circulating in Africa and understand the virus’
temporal evolution. We evaluate if these mutations have clinically relevant outcomes, assessing
implications on viral infectivity and disease severity in Africa and their potential effect on
vaccine and therapeutic development and efficacy. We clarify the role of SARS CoV2
mutations in Covid-19 disease in Africa, relative to the rest of the world.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
282 complete nucleotide sequences from African isolates were obtained from the NCBI Virus
Database. The 282 sequences were aligned with the original Wuhan sequence (GenBank
accession: NC_045512.2) (NCBI, 2020; Wang et al., 2020a) using the mem command in BWA
v. 0.7.17 (Li, 2013). The SAM file was converted to BAM file using SAMtools v. 1.10 followed
by sorting and indexing (Li et al., 2009). Duplicate marking and addition of read groups was
done using Picard v. 2.23.4 (Broad Institute, 2019). Variants were called using the mpileup
command in BCFtools v. 1.11 and visualized in IGV Viewer v. 2.8.9 (Robinson et al., 2011).
Mutant proteins and their respective positions were abstracted from the called variants and the
reference genome using a custom PHP script.
Multiple alignment was done in BLAST2 with the Bat coronavirus RaTG13 (GenBank
accession: MN996532.2) as the outgroup (NCBI, 2020; Zheng et al., 2000). The BLAST2
dump file was converted into a Nexus file using the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)
platform (Madeira et al., 2019). MEGA X: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis across
computing platforms was used to select the general time reversible (GTR) evolutionary model
(BIC score=340376.778) (Kumar, Stecher, Li, Knyaz, and Tamura 2018). Phylogenetic
analysis of the aligned sequences involved maximum likelihood (ML) method in Mr. Bayes:
Bayesian Inference of Phylogeny v 3.2.6 (ML lset nst=6, Lset rates=invgamma, parsimony
model, default priors, ngen=10000, burning=82) (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist, 2001; Ronquist &
Huelsenbeck, 2003).
The nexus translation tree was visualized using FigTree v 1.4.4 (Rambaut, 2010). The stability
of point mutations was determined based on ddG values computed using I-Mutant 3.0, a
support vector machine (SVM) tool that predicts protein stability upon single point mutations

RESULTS
A total of 282 nucleotide sequences from African isolates were analyzed. Majority of the
sequences analyzed (80%) were from Egypt. 32.7% of sequences from the rest of Africa
excluding Egypt were wild type with mutated sequences forming 67.3% of all non-Egyptian
African sequences. All of the Egyptian sequences were mutated (Supplementary table S1).
70% (n=203) of mutations were transitions while 30% (n=86) were transversions. C-> T
transitions formed 45% (n=130) of all mutations and 64% of transitions. G->T transversions
were the second most dominant mutations and formed 20% (n=57) of all mutations and 66%
of all transversions. T->G and C->G mutations were the least observed and when combined
formed ~1% of all mutations (n=2). 66% of all mutations (n=193) resulted in formation of T
from other bases (table 1, figure 1).

>T (Q57H), and 1059 C->T (T85I) were mostly present in samples from North Africa,
specifically Morocco and Tunisia (Supplementary table S3).
98.7% of all Egyptian sequences had the 3037 C->T mutation (98.7%), 25403 A->G (98.2%),
241 C->T (95.2%), 25563 G->T (81.5%), 14362 C->T (63%), 29871 A->G (63%), 15907 G>A (62.6%), 17091 T->C (62.6%), and 26257 G->T (62.6%). The 14408 C->T (P323L) was
not as widely observed in Egypt as it was in the rest of Africa (30% vs 70%). 14362C->T
(L4788L), 29871A->G (noncoding), 15907G->A (Q822K), 17091T->C (G285G) and 26257G>T (V5F) accounted for more than half of mutations in Egyptian samples but were not observed
in other African countries (Supplementary table S5).
Non-Structural Protein Mutations
Majority of the mutations (~63%) occurred in the NSP3 (16%), N (11.1%), S (11.1%), RdRp
(9.9%), NSP4 (8%), and NSP2 (6.8%) regions respectively. Least mutated regions were s2m,
ORF8, NSP16, Stem-loop 1, NSP10, and NSP7, each of which accounted for less than 1% of
all mutations. Regions showing no mutations included NSP8, NSP9, NSP11, nsp15, ORF6,
and ORF9, (Supplementary table S5). Majority of the mutations (>57%) in Egypt affected the
nsp3 (17.8%), N nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (15.1%), S (13.8%), helicase (9.9%), and nsp2
(6%) regions respectively. Least mutated regions were ORF1ab/leader protein, ORF7b,
E/envelope protein, ORF1ab/nsp10, ORF10/ Coronavirus 3' UTR pseudoknot stem-loop 1 and
ORF7a/ORF7a protein (Supplementary table S6).

Tunisia (purple), Morocco (orange), SSA (black). Samples from Italy (red) were also included. Samples are clustered into
3. The largest group was the F307F/Q822K which consisted of Egyptian samples only with F307F and Q822K always
occurring together. P323L was well distributed in North Africa, occurred in a mutually exclusive fashion with F307F/822K,
and consisted of only 3% of SSA samples. Majority of SSA samples were wild type. Italian samples were evenly distributed
between the wild type and P323L groups.

Structural Protein Mutations
Non-structural protein mutations exceeding 1% frequency occurred in the E, N, and S genes.
More than half of all Egyptian samples (62.6%, n=141) had the 26257G->T (E, V5F) mutation
and this was not observed in any other African country. The remaining 2 E mutations 26428
G->T(V62F) (1.06%) and 26299 C-> T(L19F) (0.35%) were present in Sierra Leone only
(Supplementary table S8). The L19F mutation was characterized by an 8mer homopolymeric
stretch (TTTTTTTT) and the V5F with a 4mer stretch (TTTT) (Supplementary table S7).
Mutations on the N gene were geographically limited and all were observed in Tunisia except
for 3. Egyptian samples had only 1 mutation on the nucleocapsid protein. The prevalence of
28881G->A(R203K), 28882G->A(R203R), and 28883G->C(G204R) was 8.5% for each

mutations were less than 1% in frequency.
The D614G mutation was the most dominant mutation on the spike glycoprotein. 249 (88.3%)
of all sequences (n=282) had the D614G mutation. 47% (n=55) and 25% (n=6) of the nonEgyptian and non-North African samples respectively had the D614G mutation. Nearly all
samples from Egypt (98%, n=227) had the D614G mutation. The D614G mutation was not
observed in Kenyan and Zambian samples (figure 3, Supplementary table S9).

In all samples, the D614G mutation co-occurred with 3037 C->T (F106F), 23403 A->G
(D614G), 14408 C->T (P323L), and 241 C->T. The only exception to this rule was in Egypt
where 14408 C->T (P323L) co-occurred with D614G in only 25% of all cases and 25563 G>T (Q57H) which co-occurred with D614G more than 71% all the time. 25563 G->K (Q57L)
was observed in 4% of Egyptian samples. Co-occurrence of 14408 C->T (P323L) in samples
from SSA was ~3% (Supplementary table S27 and Supplementary table S34).

22468G->T(T302T) was the second most common spike glycoprotein mutation and was
observed in 11% of all samples (Sierra Leone 27.2%, Tunisia 14.3%, Egypt 0.4%). 23127C>T(A522V) occurred on the spike GP receptor binding domain (RBD) was present in 9.5% of
all Tunisian samples (Supplementary table S10). 69% were synonymous mutations, 31%
missense mutations, 61.5% transition mutations and 38.5% transversion mutations.
Structural Protein Mutations
Structural protein mutations are tabulated in Supplementary table S13-S25. Majority of the
mutations occurred in the Nsp3 region. Structural protein mutations with an overall frequency
greater than 1% included 1059C->T(T85I) on NSP2 (3.9%), 3037C->T(F106F) (88.7%) on
NSP3, E310D on NSP4 (1.06%), and T148I on NSP8 (3.2%). 98.7% of Egyptian samples had
T851 mutation compared to 47% for the rest of Africa. This was also the commonest
synonymous NSP3 mutation worldwide (Koyama et al., 2020). A total of 16 different
mutations were observed in all African samples. 14362 C->T (F307F) and 15907G>A(Q822K) had the highest frequencies, were observed in Egypt only and co-occurred
together. The P323L mutation was less frequent in SSA (~3%) and even though it was more
widespread in North Africa, (~30%), its frequency was lower in Egypt than the global
frequency reported by Koyama et al (2020) (Supplementary table S21). 78.6% of all mutations
were deamination mutations (C->T), 21.4% were G->T transversions. All resulted in the
formation of T (Supplementary table S22). No mutations were observed for NSP10 and NSP11.
Accessory Protein Mutations
The commonest mutation of the ORF3a region was 25563G->T(Q57H). This mutation was
prevalent in 71% of all African samples, with a frequency of 81.5% in Egypt, 60% in Morocco,
38.1% in Tunisia, and 9.1% in Sierra Leone. A unique mutation not observed elsewhere was
Q57L, with a frequency of 4.4% in Egypt. Other mutations formed less than 1% of samples in

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we compared SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 282 samples collected in
Africa against the Wuhan reference genome NC_045512.2 with the aim of understanding the
evolution of the virus in Africa and the impacts of the mutations on morbidity and mortality in
Africa.
We observed that 6% of all samples collected in Africa were wild type and 94% were mutants
with 88% forming the D614G clade overall. 98% of all the Egyptian samples were the D614G
variant and 98% of all D614G variants were from North Africa. If the Egyptian samples are
excluded, wild type samples from the rest of Africa formed 34% of all sequences with the
D614G clade comprising 25% of all SSA samples. This is in contrast to the earliest data
demonstrating that the D614G variant formed 67% of all samples worldwide with higher
running counts in Europe, Asia, Oceania, and North America and lower counts in parts of South
America and Africa (Korber et al., 2020).
The wild type variant dominated the earliest samples collected from Kenya, Zambia, Ghana
and Sierra Leone. Taken together with infection numbers, the data suggests that countries in
which the earliest cases were caused by the wild type SARS CoV2 strain had relatively fewer
infections. In converse, countries that had the highest number of infections in Africa such as
South Africa, Morocco, Egypt, and Tunisia started off with a bigger proportion of the D614G
variant. The predominance of the G614 variant in the early months of the pandemic in Africa
may partly explain the relatively low numbers of those infected with covid-19 disease in many
African countries. Predominance of the D614G variant during the early months of the
pandemic may also explain the steep number of infections reported in South Africa and the
North African countries of Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia. This observation is based on findings
that the D614G variant is associated with increased infectivity as clinical samples with the

D614G mutation having higher viral titers (Hu et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020; LorenzoRedondo et al., 2020; Ozono et al., 2020; Wagner et al., 2020). D614G is more infectious than
the wild type sequence as it binds more efficiently to the human ACE2 receptor (Hu et al.,
2020; Korber et al., 2020; Lorenzo-Redondo et al., 2020; Ozono et al., 2020; Wagner et al.,
2020).
The WHO recently raised an alarm over the surge in infections in parts of Africa where the
number of infections had remained low since the first case in Africa was reported in February.
As pointed out by Korber et al (2020), the D614G variant has increased fitness and is under
positive selection. Thus, the predominance may shift from the wild type to the D614G variant,
allowing the latter to establish itself and predominate in areas where the wild type strain had
been previously established with time (Korber et al., 2020; Koyama et al., 2020). Whereas
there’s limited data of samples from Africa sequenced in the past few weeks, it is possible that
the recent surge in cases in African countries that had hitherto low cases is due to the shift to
the D614G variant. Genomic studies of current samples will help to clarify this.
Absence of other mutations on the spike glycoprotein appear to have influenced the course of
the disease in Africa. Global studies have identified 4 other variants on the spike glycoprotein
that appear to enhance virus pathogenicity. These variants are D364Y, V483A, G476S, and
V367F all of which affect the S1 RBD domain. Ou et al (2020) observed that the V367F and
D364Y variants confer more structural stability to the S protein and this enables the SARS
CoV2 virus to bind more efficiently to the human ACE2 receptor (Ou et al., 2020).
Experimental studies have demonstrated that V367F is associated with enhanced cell entry.
Other RBD mutants that have been identified include N354D and W436R. N354D and D364Y,
V367F, W436R had significantly lowered ΔG and significantly lowered equilibrium
dissociation constant (KD) compared to the reference strain, suggesting that these mutants have
significantly increased affinity to human ACE. In double mutants with N354D and D364Y, the

latter provides increased affinity and this implies that the main contributor of the enhanced
affinity is D364Y. Experimental validation assays prove that V367F significantly lowers the
ED50 concentration of S and ACE2 receptor-ligand binding (Ou et al., 2020). These mutants
are proposed to bind ACE2 more stably due to the enhancement of the base 208 rigidity (Ou et
al., 2020). Our study did not identify any of these mutants in African samples and this may
also explain the relatively lower morbidity and mortality seen in the African continent.
Another significant finding was on the occurrence of the P323L mutation on the RdRp protein.
Globally, P323L is one of the commonest SARS CoV2 mutations with a frequency of over
90% in countries such as the United States (Koyama et al., 2020). In Africa however, the P323L
mutation had an overall frequency of 34%, with only 3% of these mutations occurring in SSA.
Whereas Egypt had a relatively high frequency of P323L (30.4%), only 25% of mutations cooccurred with D614G. Global data shows a near 100% correlation between D614G and P323L
(Kannan et al., 2020).
P323L is thought to enhance viral infectivity together with D614G. According to Kannan et al
(2020), the location of P323L on the NSP12-NSP8 interface may position the leucine side chain
closer to F396, leading to enhanced hydrophobic interactions between NSP8 L122 residue and
nsp12 T323 (Cγ2) and L270 residues. This is thought to enhance viral replication through
improved processivity of NSP12 (Kannan et al., 2020). This observation seems to suggest that
the low frequency of P323L in Africa may be a contributor to the relatively less severe impact
of covid-19 disease in the continent compared to other regions even in areas such as Egypt
where the D614G variant predominates.
We also observed the low frequency of the ORF8 L84S mutation in Africa. L84S was the first
observed mutation and is one of the commonest mutation worldwide with a frequency
exceeding 50% and associated with severe disease in Italy, (Koyama et al., 2020; Wang et al.,

2020b). This mutation was present in 2.5% of African samples. The ORF8 protein aids in
immune evasion through downregulation of major histocompatibility complex molecules class
I (MCH-I) (Zhang et al., 2020). The L84S mutation is thought to decrease protein stability
(DdG=0.99 kcal/mol) and protein rigidity, a factor that may disfavour SARS CoV2, leading to
increased immune surveillance and reduced viral titres (Wang et al., 2020b). The effect of this
mutation on disease severity and whether its low frequency in Africa contributes to the
relatively low disease burden merits more experimental studies.
Other important findings related to the ORF3a protein. The first observation was that only 1
sample from SSA had the Q57H mutation on the ORF3a accessory protein. This mutation
occurred in 81% of all Egyptian samples, in 60% of Moroccan samples and in 38% of Tunisian
samples. The second observation was that the G251V ORF3a mutation which occurred first in
Italy and Brazil and was associated with many infections formed less than 2% of all African
samples (Koyama et al., 2020).
As reported by Koyama et al., Q57H is the commonest mutation worldwide (Koyama et al.,
2020). Taken together with the earlier observations about the D614G variant, this observation
suggests two things. First, it seems to point to Europe and or USA as the origin of the virus in
much of North Africa since this the D614G/Q57H first occurred in France and has since then
predominated in the USA (Koyama et al., 2020). Secondly, it may have implications on the
disease burden in Africa. ORF3a interacts with both S and ORF8 proteins. According to Wu et
al (2020), the Q57H mutation results in increased binding affinity between the Q57H Orf3a
and S (ΔΔG = 4.2 kcal/mol). This dramatic increase in the binding affinity due to the Q57H
mutation may have several consequences. First, it may cause failure of treatment by shifting
the protein‐binding interface and destroying drug‐targeting sites (Wu et al., 2020). Secondly,
it leads to formation of an early stop codon to orf3b after amino acid 13 (Δ3b), resulting in a
truncated ORF3b protein with consequent loss of interferon antagonism (Lam et al., 2020).

Other findings show that the Q57H variant does not seem to influence channel properties and
does not result in any significant differences functionally compared to the wildtype ORF3a.
This may be attributed to the mutation being located on the N-terminal which determines the
subcellular localization of the virus without influencing channel properties (Kern et al., 2020).
Further research on the clinical importance of Q57H is warranted.
In the present study, we also observed 3 missense mutations in the E protein: V5F, V62F, and
L19F that may be of clinic-epidemiological importance. E is a 75-residue integral viroporin
involved in viral replication, pathogenesis and assembly, activation of host inflammasome, and
virion release (Lim & Liu, 2001; Nieto-Torres et al., 2014; Ruch & Machamer, 2012; Weiss &
Navas-Martin, 2005). E is highly conserved in coronaviruses with very few observed mutations
(Qingfu et al., 2003). Deletion of E is associated with attenuation in some coronaviruses.
Reduced virulence due to E mutations has been reported (De Diego et al., 2007; Nieto-Torres
et al., 2014; Pervushin et al., 2009). E is hence a suitable target for drug and vaccine
development and channel activity may be optimally inhibited by targeting small-molecule
drugs to host cell Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment
(ERGIC) (Mandala et al., 2020).
Structurally, E is made up of an N-terminal domain (NTD), an ion-conducting transmembrane
domain (TMD), and a cytoplasmic domain (CTD) (Wu et al., 2003; Mandala et al., 2020). The
V5F mutation affects the NTD and was present in more than half of all Egyptian samples
(62.6%, n=141). This mutation has not been reported elsewhere to the best of our knowledge.
The V19F and V62F mutations affect the TMD and CTD respectively. These 2 mutations are
characterized by 8mer (TTTTTTTT) and 4mer (TTTT) homopolymeric stretches. Mutation
analysis using the I-Mutant Suite indicate DdG values of 0.77 Kcal/mol, -1.21 Kcal/mol, and 1.04 Kcal/mol for V62F, L19F and V5F. This suggests that the mutations result in highly
unstable and temperature-sensitive E proteins. This observation is consistent with the work of

Fischer et al (1998) who investigated the effect of E mutations on reduced thermostability and
morphology aberrance (Fischer et al., 1998).
Since the E protein is essential for induction of interferon synthesis and apoptosis, RNA
replication, and production and release of membrane vesicles or virus-like particles (VLPs) in
coronaviruses (An et al., 1999; Corse & Machamer, 2000; Maeda et al., 2001; De Diego et al.,
2007; Nieto-Torres et al., 2014; Pervushin et al., 2009; Mandala et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2003),
the observed mutations may impact the pathogenicity of SARS CoV2 in Africa. The mutations
may also hinder effective detection of the virus using currently available RT-PCR kits based
on amplification of the E protein. As noted, ~63% of samples from Egypt had the V5F
mutation. It is not clear if this mutation has an impact on disease severity and currently
available RT-PCR and other diagnostic tests for SARS CoV2. More studies are needed to
clarify the effect of these mutations on viral pathogenicity and viral detection using currently
available RT-PCR kits.
Observations about the mutations on the E protein need also to be discussed in conjunction
with ORF3a since ORF3a is also a viroporin-coding gene in coronaviruses (An et al., 1999;
Jiang et al., 2005; Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012). In SARS CoV2, ORF3a forms homotetrameric
potassium sensitive ion channels (viroporin) that mediates the activation of NLRP3
inflammasome (Siu et al., 2019; Farag et al., 2020; Wozniak et al., 2010). Viroporin subunits
undergo oligomerization, forming hydrophilic pores that allow ions to be shuttled across the
membranes of host cells and facilitate the cellular entry of viruses and release of viruses from
infected cells and viral replication and assembly (Farag et al., 2020). Deletion of genes coding
for viroporins leads to a significant reduction in viral progeny formation and reduces the
pathogenicity of viruses (Farag et al., 2020). As noted previously, viroporins induce
inflammaosme activity. Inflammasomes can regulate the activity of caspase-1. Caspase-1

mediates interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) and interleukin 18 (IL-18) maturation. In turn, IL-1β and IL18 (Farag et al., 2020).
E and ORF3a proteins are thought to contribute to NLRP3 inflammasome activity and are
essential for maximal replication and virulence of SARS CoV (Farag et al., 2020). SARS CoV
viruses lacking E and ORF3a are not viable. Even though it contributes to viral pathogenesis,
ORF3a in SARS CoV is not essential for replication (Siu et al., 2020).
Siu et al (2019) showed that ORF3a-associated activation of NLRP3 inflammasome activity is
mediated through TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3)–mediated ubiquitination of
apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) (Siu
et al., 2019). Findings by Siu et al (2020) also demonstrate that ORF3a up-regulates expression
of fibrinogen subunits FGA, FGB and FGG in host lung epithelial cells in SARS CoV. ORF3a
is also involved in the induction of apoptosis in cell culture and in the downregulation of type
1 interferon receptor through induction of serine phosphorylation within the IFN alpha-receptor
subunit 1 (IFNAR1) degradation motif and increasing the ubiquitination of IFNAR1 (Siu et al.,
2019). Based on the foregoing, the effect of the E and ORF3a mutations merit further
investigations.
Majority (>70%) of the mutations were transition mutations, with C->T transitions making up
44% of these transitions. This finding is similar to observations in other studies that show
dominance of C->T mutations in SARS CoV2 genome (Koyama et al., 2020; Mishra et al.,
2020; Wang et al., 2020b; Badua et al., 2020). G->T transversions were the second most
common mutations in our study followed by A->G and T->C transitions. Together, C->T and
G->T transitions made up 64% of all mutations, underlining the role of deamination in SARS
CoV2 evolution.

CpG depletion is an important mechanism deployed by RNA viruses to evade host antiviral
proteins. This is because unmethylated CpG dinucleotides stimulate TLR 9 innate immune
responses. Since CpG-rich codons have a lower transcription rate, CpG depletion also serves
to enhance the virus transcription rate. Depletion of CpG dinucleotides may occur in response
to selection pressure from host immune system, from spontaneous deamination of methylated
cytosines in CpG dinucleotdes, and deamination of unmethylate d cytosines. Depletion of CpG
is also a strategy that ensures the epigenetic silencing of the virus, leading to establishment of
latent viral infection (Bird, 1980; Chinnery et al., 2012; Medvedeva et al., 2010; Wiebauer et
al., 1993). Depletion may be driven by host ZAP or APOBEC proteins. In the present study,
we observed that 95% of all the mutations in the NSP12 (RdRp) protein are deamination
mutations. The role of RdRp deamination mutations in attenuating viral virulence in SARS
CoV2 needs to be investigated further.
Findings reported in the present study may have clinico-epidemiological implications. We have
noted the absence or presence in low frequencies of mutations associated with increased
infectivity, virus fitness, and disease severity. Experimental studies will help to clarify the
clinical impact of these mutations. On vaccines, the RBD has important epitopic antigens.
Some of the identified mutations may alter the binding affinity of vaccines raised against the
prototype strain hence leading to a reduction in vaccine efficacy (Ou et al., 2020). Further
studies also need to investigate if the CpG depletion that is widespread on the SARS CoV2
RdRp is a strategy to attenuate viral virulence (Ficarelli et al., 2020; Trus et al., 2020) and
immune escape and determine if it has a role in the relatively low morbidity and mortality
numbers in Africa.
Mutation analysis is a critical factor when selecting suitable targets for drug design. Currently,
there are a number of drugs in use, undergoing clinical trials, or proposed as suitable drug
targets against SARS CoV2 genomic or sub-genomic RNA regions. Lopinavir and ritonavir

were proposed for repurposing of SARS CoV2 3-chymotrypsin-like (3CLpro) and papain-like
(PLpro) proteases (Nutho et al., 2020; Xiaopan et al., 2020). Remdesivir and Favipravir target
the RdRp (Goldman et al., 2020; Pandey et al., 2020) while Ribavirin interferes with mRNA
capping and viral replication (Khalili et al., 2020; Pandey et al., 2020; Tong et al., 2020).
Osetalmivir which targets the 3CLPro was found to be ineffective in the treatment of SARS
CoV2 (Tan et al., 2020). Interferons induce production of Mx proteins that are thought to
inhibit viral replication (Spiegel et al., 2004). Teicoplanin is thought to prevent viral entry
through inhibition of cathepsin L (Zhang et al., 2020). Baricitinib which was discovered using
artificial intelligence (AI) methods, prevents viral entry by binding to AP2‐associated protein
kinase 1 (AAK1) to block clathrin-dependent endocytosis and modulation of inflammatory
cytokines through selective inhibition of Janus Kinase (JAK) (Caputo et al., 2020). Other
compounds that have been mentioned as possible drugs for covid-19 disease include
azithromycin (Echeverría-Esnal et al., 2020) and arbidol (Gao et al., 2020). Except for
remdesivir and corticosteroids, studies on many of these other drugs are still ongoing or have
produced conflicting results (Echeverría-Esnal et al., 2020; Pandey et al., 2020).
Mutations may have an impact on the binding of SARS CoV2 antiviral drugs and this has
implications on drug design and drug resistance. This has been noted for antiviral drugs
targeting the RdRp regions and the effectiveness of compounds such as remdesivir may be
hampered by the mutations (Pandey et al., 2020). On drug design, regions such as PLpro,
RdRp, and S that exhibited high mutation rates may be less suitable drug and diagnostics
targets, and regions showing limited or no mutations such as ORF8, NSP8, NSP9, NSP11,
nsp15, ORF6, 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase, and ORF9 may be more attractive targets.
Assessment of viral mutations provided protein stability data and can be used to model protein
folding as well as assess binding affinity around the mutation. This helps to assess possible
drug resistance phenotypes, select optimal targets for lead candidate development, correlate

mutations with disease severity, and map putative target sites. Further studies need to consider
these mutations in this respect.
Limitations of the Study
Out of the 18,820 global SARS CoV2 sequences deposited in NCBI, African sequences
accounted for 280 or just 1.5% of all sequences and Egypt accounts for 80% of these sequences
collected in Africa at the time of the analysis. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 0.29% of all
sequences. Only 9 African countries had some SARS CoV2 sequences; not a single sequence
was seen for 45 other countries. Evidently, very little effort is being made to sequence samples
collected in Africa and understand the mutation patterns in this continent. The small sample
size may not be sufficient to make sweeping generalizations. The genetic picture captured in
this study is a temporal screenshot that explains the genetic variation present months ago. The
mutation landscape is a constantly changing mosaic that is temporal in nature and which
requires constant genomic analysis for continuous tracking.
