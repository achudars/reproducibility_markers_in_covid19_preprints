Abstract

Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global health emergency.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) interacts with angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter the cells and infects diverse human tissues. It has been
reported that a few conditions, including cancer, predispose individuals to SARS-CoV-2
infection and severe form of COVID-19. These findings led us to evaluate the susceptibility
of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection by investigation of ACE2
expression in their tumor tissues. The expression analysis revealed that both mRNA and
protein levels of ACE2 had increased in colon cancer samples than normal group. Next, the
prognosis analysis has indicated that the upregulation of ACE2 was not correlated with
patient survival outcomes. Further assessment displayed the hypomethylation of the ACE2
gene promoter in COAD patients. Surprisingly, this methylation status has a strong negative
correlation with ACE2 gene expression. The functional enrichment analysis of the genes that
had similar expression patterns with ACE2 in colon cancer tissues demonstrated that they
mainly enriched in Vitamin digestion and absorption, Sulfur relay system, and Fat digestion
and absorption pathways. Finally, we found that ACE2 gene expression had a significant
association with the immune cell infiltration levels in COAD patients. In conclusion, it has
plausible that COAD patients are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and experience
severe injuries. Moreover, COVID-19 would bring unfavorable survival outcomes of patients
with colon cancer by the way of immune cell infiltration linked process. The present study
highlights the importance of preventive actions for COAD patients during the COVID-19
pandemic.

Introduction

Since the first report of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in
China in December 2019, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has affected about six million
confirmed cases around the world by the end of May 2020 (1-3). The wide range of COVID19 symptoms, such as fever, cough, tiredness, headache, diarrhea, and cardiac injury,
implying that SARS-CoV-2 infects not only the respiratory tract but also various human
organs (2, 4-8). SARS-CoV-2 interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
receptors to start infection of the cells (9-12). Interestingly, a higher prevalence of COVID-19
has shown in patients with diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases (13, 14).
Moreover, the mRNA levels of the ACE2 gene are particularly high in many human tissues
including the lung, heart, liver, kidney, stomach, and colon (15-17). Albeit the exact
underlying mechanism is unknown, the expression levels of ACE2 have introduced to play a
role in the increased susceptibility of diabetic and hypertensive patients to SARS-CoV-2
infection. Therefore, the expression levels of ACE2 seem to have a prominent effect on the
individuals’ risk for the COVID-19.
Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), as the most common type of colon cancer, ranks fourth
most common cancer by incidence and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths
worldwide (18, 19). Although the diagnosis and treatment of COAD patients are much
improved, the survival rate of these patients remains unsatisfactory, mostly due to the latediagnosis (20, 21). Increasing data has indicated the correlation of the immune cell
infiltration in colon cancer with the patients’ clinical outcomes (22). It has been wellestablished that cancerous patients are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than
those without, because of anticancer treatments and altered immune state. Besides, they
appear to have severe COVID-19 symptoms in comparison to the general population (23,

24). These findings led us to investigate the susceptibility of colon cancer patients to SARSCoV-2 infection by analyzing the expression levels of the ACE2 gene in these patients as a
fundamental component for the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Indeed, we tested the possibility
of changing the prognosis of COAD patients through immune cell infiltration dependent
mechanism after infection by COVID-19.
In the present study, we used several databases to investigate the gene expression,
prognostic merit, and the DNA methylation status of the ACE2 gene in colon
adenocarcinoma. We also conducted an enrichment analysis of ACE2 co-expressed genes.
Then, the association of the ACE2 gene expression with immune cell infiltration level in
COAD patients was examined.

Materials and Methods
Expression analysis

The expression levels of the human ACE2 gene in the colon cancer and corresponding
control tissues in the TCGA-COAD (Colon Adenocarcinoma) cohort, were assessed by the
Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) 2 (http://gepia2.cancerpku.cn/#analysis) database (25). Adjusted p-value <0.01, and log2 fold change |log2fc|>1
were set as cut of criterion. Besides, we applied the protein expression analysis for ACE2 in
normal tissues and colon cancer, utilizing the data from Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis
Consortium

(CPTAC)

Confirmatory/Discovery

dataset

through

UALCAN (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/analysis-prot.html) database (26).
Prognosis analysis

We employed two online databases to perform the survival analysis for the ACE2 gene in
colon cancer patients. The OncoLnc database (http://www.oncolnc.org/) was utilized to
conducting the Overall Survival (OS) analysis, by the expression level of the ACE2 gene,
based on the data of TCGA-COAD cohort (27). In addition, we evaluated the prognostic
significance of ACE2 gene expression, using the Meta-survival analysis option in the GENT2
database (http://gent2.appex.kr/gent2/) (28). The auto-select best cutoff was set for both
databases.
DNA methylation analysis

We investigated the DNA methylation status of the ACE2 gene in the COAD cases of the
TCGA-COAD cohort through the UALCAN database. Furthermore, the association between
the gene expression and promoter methylation of the ACE2 gene in the normal and primary

colon cancer tissues, was explored by the DNMIVD database(http://119.3.41.228/dnmivd/)
(29).
Functional enrichment analysis

Based on the data of the TCGA-COAD cohort, we used the GEPIA 2 database to provide a
group of genes that have a similar expression pattern with ACE2 in colon cancer. Then, the
data of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathway analysis for these co-expressed genes were obtained from the Enrichr
(http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr) database (30). p-value less than 0.05 was set as a cut
off criterion.
Immune cell infiltration analysis

We

utilized

the

CIBERSORT

algorithm

through

TIMER

2.0

database

(http://timer.cistrome.org/) (31) to evaluate the correlation of the ACE2 expression with
immune cells infiltration in COAD, including CD8+ T cell, activated Memory CD4+ T cell,
resting Memory CD4+ T cell, Naive CD4+ T cell, Regulatory T cell (Tregs), Follicular helper T
cell, Gamma delta T cell, Memory B cell, Naive B cell, Plasma B cell, Neutrophils, Monocytes,
Eosinophils, M0 Macrophages, M1 Macrophages, M2 Macrophages, activated Myeloid
Dendritic Cell (DC), resting Myeloid DC, activated Natural Killer (NK) cell, and resting NK cell.
The correlation p-value adjusted by tumor purity.

Results
Expression analysis

First, we conducted the expression analysis using GEPIA 2 database. As depicted in Figure 1,
pan-cancer analysis of the human ACE2 gene, revealed that mRNA levels of ACE2 increased
in several tumors, especially in colon cancer (Figure 1A). Box plot analysis detected an
overexpression level of ACE2 in the tissues of colon adenocarcinoma (Figure 1B, Adjusted
P<0.01), compared with the normal tissues. The protein expression analysis results further
showed that the expression level of ACE2 protein was higher in the cancer tissues than that
in the controls (Figure 1C, P=7.53e-04).
Prognosis analysis

We carried out a correlation analysis between the ACE2 gene expression and the prognosis
outcome of colon cancer patients based on the TCGA-COAD cohort data from OncoLnc
database and survival data of multiple GEO datasets in GENT2 platform. The results
demonstrated not a significant correlation between elevated expression of the ACE2 gene
and overall survival of patients with colon cancer (Figure 2).
DNA methylation analysis data

We further studied the potential etiology of the elevated ACE2 expression in colon cancer
patients. So, we used UALCAN database to determine the methylation status of ACE2
promoter in COAD. Interestingly, the methylation status of the ACE2 promoter in COAD was
significantly reduced, when compared with that in normal tissue (Figure 3A). Meanwhile,
DNMIVD database analysis indicated that the promoter region of the ACE2 gene was
hypomethylated in COAD tumor tissues (Figure 3B). Notably, the Pearson and Spearman
correlation analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between the expression of

the ACE2 mRNA and methylation status of ACE2 gene in COAD (Figure 3C, 3D). Thus, DNA
methylation may be involved in the molecular mechanism of the ACE2 gene overexpression
in tumor tissues and in the pathogenesis of colon cancer.
Functional analysis of co-expressed genes of ACE2 in colon cancer

The co-expression analysis using GEPIA 2 database provided a total of 100 associated genes
for ACE2 in colon cancer (Table S1). The GO analysis data of Figure 4A, 4C identified the
related biological process (vitamin transport, vitamin transmembrane transport, regulation
of reactive oxygen species metabolic process), cellular component (cortical cytoskeleton,
cytoskeleton, histone acetyltransferase complex), and molecular function (ribosomal
protein S6 kinase activity, sulfurtransferase activity, solute:sodium symporter activity).
KEGG pathway enrichment analysis data further exploited several enriched pathways, such
as Vitamin digestion and absorption, Sulfur relay system, and Fat digestion and absorption
pathways (Figure 4D).
Immune cell infiltration analysis data

We investigated whether the transcription levels of the ACE2 gene play a role in the etiology
of colon cancer through immune cell infiltration. As listed in Table 1, the expression of the
ACE gene

in colon cancer positively correlated with the infiltration level of the following

immune cells: Memory B cell, Plasma B cell, activated myeloid DC, and resting myeloid DC.
Moreover, the infiltration level of CD8+, T cell, and activated NK cells negatively correlated
with the ACE2 gene expression levels (Figure S1).

Discussion

The COVID-19 pandemic is now widely spreading across the world and has become an
international health emergency (32). The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are varied,
ranging from pulmonary-associated injuries to multi-organ failure, indicating that SARS-CoV2 affects diverse human tissues (33). The SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptors to infect
the host cells (6). It has reported that cancer patients have a higher risk of being infected by
SARS-CoV-2 and developing severer symptoms, mainly because of compromised immune
systems and the malignancy state (24). So, the ACE2 receptor maybe serves as an essential
factor for the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (34). The present study explored the biological links
of the human ACE2 gene expression with SARS-CoV-2 in colon cancer patients from different
perspectives.
We first used the GEPIA 2 database and detected the overexpression of ACE2 mRNA in
primary tissues when compared with controls. The protein expression level analysis by the
UALCAN database displayed that the protein levels of ACE2 were increased in COAD
patients. We further explored the prognostic significance of the ACE2 gene expression in
patients with colon adenocarcinoma utilizing the OnoLnc and GENT2 databases. The survival
analysis showed no apparent association between the ACE2 gene mRNA levels and the
patient’s overall survival outcome. Subsequently, using co-expression analysis of GEPIA 2
database, we obtained the ACE2 co-expressed genes in colon cancer tissues, and then
carried out a series of functional annotation and enrichment analyses. Our data
demonstrated that the ACE2 mostly enriched in Vitamin digestion and absorption, Sulfur
relay system, and Fat digestion and absorption pathways. Finally, we evaluated the
correlation of ACE2 gene expression with immune cell infiltration in patients with colon

adenocarcinoma. The data retrieved from the TIMER database indicated a considerable
correlation between the ACE2 gene expression and the infiltration level of CD8+ T cell,
Memory B cells, Plasma B cells, activated myeloid DCs, resting myeloid DCs, and activated
NK cells in patients with colon cancer.
The detected upregulation of the ACE2 gene in tumor tissues suggested that COAD patients
were more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several pieces of evidence highlighted the
role of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in colon cancer patients’ survival (35, 36). For
example, Wu D et al. uncovered the remarkable association of memory B cells with colon
cancer survival risk (22). Surprisingly, our data unearthed a considerable correlation
between ACE2 expression and immune cell infiltration in COAD. It has indicated that the
SARS-CoV genome sequence has high homology with SARS-CoV-2 (37) Moreover, Kuba et al.
showed the SARS-CoV decreased the expression of ACE2 in the lung cells (38). These
findings unveiled that the levels of ACE2 in colon tumor tissues similarly be reduced after
COVID-19 infection. If so, the prognosis of colon cancer patients may be influenced by SARSCoV-2 infection, since we found a positive association between ACE2 expression and
Immune cell infiltration in colon cancer patients.
Conclusions

All data together, the ACE2 levels had increased in colon cancer tissues. Hence, these
patients appear to be more susceptible to COVID-19. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 infection
presumably reduced the ACE2 level in tumor tissues and altered immune cell infiltration
level, which would bring poor prognosis for patients with colon cancer. Our findings
highlight the value of protective actions for COAD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic
era.

DNA methylation analysis by UALCAN showed a lower methylation level for

gene in COAD (A). We also detected the hypomethylation of

ACE2

promoter in COAD (B),

and strong negative correlation between mRNA expression and methylation status of

gene in COAD (C, D), using DNMIVD database.
