Abstract

20

The unprecedent situation generated by the COVID-19 global emergency has prompted

21

scientists around the world to actively work to fight against this pandemic. In this sense,

22

it is remarkable the number of drug repurposing efforts trying to shed light into the

23

COVID-19 patients’ treatment.

24

In the attempt to proceed toward a proper rationalization of the search for new antivirals

25

among approved drugs, we carried out a hierarchical in silico/in vitro protocol which

26

successfully combines virtual and biological screening to speed up the identification of

27

host-directed therapies against COVID-19 in an effective way.

28

A successful combination of a multi-target virtual screening approach focused on host-

29

based targets related to viral entry and experimental evaluation of the antiviral activity of

30

selected compounds has been carried out. As a result, three different potentially

31

repurposable drugs interfering with viral entry, cepharantine, imatinib and efloxate, have

32

been identified.

INTRODUCTION

2

Together with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle

3

East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 is the third

4

pathogenic and transmissible coronavirus emerged in humans. This new coronavirus

5

(CoV) is the causative agent of the present pandemic of coronavirus disease named

6

COVID-19 first reported in Wuhan (China) (1). Since there is no effective treatment

7

available and given the urgency of the pandemic, the repurposing of approved drugs is

8

the only alternative to find a cure for the present emergency. In fact, several clinical trials

9

are currently ongoing to prove the efficacy of old drugs in COVID-19 patients (2). Such

10

is the case of the drugs including in the SOLIDARITY clinical trial (remdesivir,

11

hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-beta1a), launched by the WHO in

12

dozens of countries that showed little or no effects on hospitalized COVID-19 patients at

13

proposed dose regimens (3). Moreover, the only drug approved by the FDA for the

14

treatment of extreme-ill patients is remdesivir (4), an antiviral originally developed for

15

Ebola virus infection (5).

16

Although in principle not very innovative, drug repurposing is a promising approach to

17

accelerate the drug discovery process which allows to increase the productivity of the

18

pharmaceutical companies (6), and fill the gap existing in unmet diseases such as rare

19

or infectious diseases (7, 8). In viral infections lacking of an effective treatment, drug

20

repurposing combined with drug validation in animal models has enhanced the number

21

of potential antivirals with known mechanism of action (9).

22

The COVID-19 global emergency has generated an unprecedented situation, which

23

prompted scientists all around the world to actively work in all imaginable aspects related

24

to SARS-CoV-2. In only few months, the knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 significantly

25

increased and the available information today is quite large. Together with the efforts to

26

better understand the epidemiology, virus structure and life cycle, several therapeutic

27

targets to guide the drug discovery research have also emerged (10). In this regard, it is

28

remarkable the number of drug repurposing efforts trying to shed light into the COVID-

29

19 patients treatment (11, 12). Today, far from initial opportunistic and mainly

30

serendipitous discoveries in the drug repurposing field, a number of candidates have

31

been proposed to be repurposed for COVID-19 based on different in silico and in vitro

32

studies (13).

33

In the attempt to proceed toward a proper rationalization of the search for new antivirals

34

among approved drugs, we here implement a hierarchical in silico/in vitro protocol, which

35

successfully combines virtual and biological screening to speed up the identification of

36

anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents in an effective way.

1

Moreover, as viral mutations represent one of the main challenges to overcome with

2

antiviral therapies, we carried out a multi-target virtual screening protocol focused on

3

druggable targets related to viral entry followed by biological screening against SARS-

4

CoV-2 to identify host-directed therapies against COVID-19. In this regard, eight proteins

5

mainly involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry and trafficking were considered.

6

The US Drug Collection of 1789 compounds of FDA approved drugs was screened

7

toward these targets, which consisted on the proteases TMPRSS2, Furin and Cathepsin

8

L, the kinases AAK1, GAK and PIKfyve as well as the two-pore ion channel TPC2.

9

Additionally, the receptor binding domain (S-RBD) of the viral Spike (S) glycoprotein,

10

which is recognized by the host protein, ACE2 during virus attachment, was included in

11

the analysis. A total of 173 FDA repurposable drugs were selected from virtual screening

12

and subsequently experimentally evaluated. Primary hits were validated using several

13

methods involving viral antigen detection as well as viral RNA load in infected cells.

14

Confirmed candidates were subsequently tested for their ability to interfere selectively

15

with viral entry in a surrogate model of infection. This process led to the identification of

16

cepharantine, imatinib and efloxate as selective SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors, together

17

with a panel of non-selective entry inhibitors that could be considered for drug

18

repurposing.

RESULTS

22

Virtual screening against selected targets

23

A hierarchical virtual screening (VS) approach was applied on crucial SARS-CoV-2

24

protein targets in the attempt to find repurposable agents from the original list of FDA

25

approved drugs. Among all the proposed druggable targets for SARS-CoV-2, eight

26

proteins responsible for virus entry and trafficking were selected in this study. A

27

schematic representation of their role in virus entry and trafficking is displayed in Figure

28

5

Spike glycoprotein represents a crucial factor for virus entry and thus for virus tropism,

6

virulence and pathogenesis (14, 15). From a structural point of view, the protein is

7

characterized by an homotrimeric ensemble of about 1000-1200 amino acid residues

8

per monomeric unit and is located on the outer envelope of the virion. For both SARS-

9

CoV and SARS-CoV-2, cell-virus membrane fusion is promoted by the recognition of

10

specific host proteins, or cell-binding agents such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme

11

2 (ACE2), which binds the receptor biding domain (RBD) located at the S1 subunit of the

12

head region of the protein (15). S priming is essential to promote membranes fusion.

13

This process is catalyzed by specific host soluble proteases, which can move and come

14

close to S at the cell-virus interface.

15

The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is cleaved at S1/S2 site by the host transmembrane serine

16

protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a type II transmembrane serine protease of the TTSPs family,

17

mainly expressed in the surface of the airway epithelial cells (16). TMPRSS2 was

18

demonstrated to also cleave ACE2 (17, 18), enhancing viral infectivity. Accordingly,

19

TMPRSS2 was proposed to enhance virus infection by simultaneously acting on (i)

1

ACE2 cleavage, which could promote viral uptake and (ii) S priming, which activate cell-

2

viral membrane fusion (17, 18).

3

Furin pertains to the class of the calcium-dependent proprotein/prohormone convertase

4

(PCs) and is a serine protease which is implicated in several pathological processes

5

related to cancer, atherosclerosis and infectious diseases as those caused by Influenza

6

A and SARS-CoV (19). Proteolytic cleavage of S is also promoted by other host

7

proteases such as furin, which have cumulative effects of TMPRSS2-mediated S priming

8

and SARS-CoV-2 entry (20).

9

Cathepsin L is a lysosomal cysteine protease of the papain family of CA (clan CA, family

10

C1, subfamily C1A) and was recognized as responsible for the nonspecific cleavage

11

within lysosomes. Its proteolytic activity was also linked to the propagation of several

12

infectious diseases through the cleavage and activation of viral glycoproteins responsible

13

for virus entry in the host cell in Ebola (21) and Hendra (22) viruses. Cathepsin L is also

14

involved in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S priming. In vitro studies demonstrated that

15

Cathepsin L can also perform of the proteolytic activity on the Spike glycoprotein when

16

the other host proteases mainly involved in S priming are absent (23).

17

All these findings highlight the pivotal role exerted by host proteases in viral infection (24,

18

25) thus confirming their inhibition as a valuable strategy to tackle COVID-19.

19

The adaptor-associated kinase 1 (AAK-1) and the cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK)

20

represent other two interesting drug targets against SARS-CoV-2. They are members of

21

the numb-associated kinase family (NAK) and their inhibition exerts an antiviral effect in

22

in vitro assays (26, 27). NAK inhibitors exert their antiviral effect by blocking clathrin

23

assembly necessary for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the ACE2-bound SARS-CoV-

24

2 particles, which are then transported to the endosome during virus entry (28).

25

The main endosomal phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate/phosphatidylinositol 5-kinase

26

(PIKfyve) was proposed to be related with intracellular trafficking of Ebola and SARS-

27

CoV-2 viral particles (29). Moreover, the potential relevance of this target was highlighted

28

by the antiviral effect exerted by the small PIKfyve inhibitor apilimod.

29

The type 2 endo-lysosomal two-pore channel (TPC2) is mainly expressed in late

30

endosomes/lysosomes. It mediates intracellular trafficking of coronavirus through the

31

endo-lysosomal system. Accordingly, activation of TPC2 induces a calcium-dependent

32

depolarization of the endo-lysosomal membrane, which is supposed to enhance S-driven

33

membrane fusion (30). In this context, TPC2 inhibitors such as verapamil (31), would be

34

able to negatively affect depolarization thus reducing the fusogenic propensity during

35

virus-host membrane fusion.

36

A list of 1789 FDA-approved drugs was screened on all the previously cited targets (see

37

Materials and Methods section for the computational details) to find effective antiviral

11

According to the scheme reported in Figure 2, all the systems were subjected to

12

structural refinement by mean of energy minimization and the minimized structures were

13

then used for VS. A special refinement was reserved to the S1-RBD domain of Spike

14

and to the homology modelled structured of PIKfyve and TMPRSS2.

15

For PIKfyve enzyme, minimization of the homology modelled protein was realized in the

16

presence of ATP substrate. This allowed to correctly reorient side chains for residues

17

pertaining to the ATP binding site during minimization, preserving the geometry and

18

shape of the cavity.

19

In case of S1-RBD and TMPRSS2, a further treatment based on molecular dynamic

20

(MD) simulation in the NVT ensemble was applied. This allowed to properly explore local

21

conformational flexibility of the ACE2 binding domain of S1-RBD and to refine the

22

homology modelled structure of TMPRSS2 prior to virtual screening.

1

Trajectory analysis for S1-RBD and TMPRSS2 revealed a good stability along the MD

2

simulation (Figure S1 of the supporting information). For S1-RBD, a close analysis of

3

the residues present in to the ACE2 recognition motif on the receptor binding region,

4

revealed a mayor degree of fluctuation at the loop containing F154, N155 and Y157 (in

5

dark blue in Figure S1A). Less mobility, generally lower than 1 Å, was observed in the

6

other regions. For TMPRSS2 (Figure S1B), significant fluctuations were observed

7

around the catalytic residues, H296, D345 and S441 (especially for loops in light blue,

8

orange and green), which would be ascribable to the significant solvent exposition of the

9

active site. For these two targets, the minimized structure and the most representative

10

clusters (Table S1 and Table S2 of the supporting information) obtained from MD

11

simulations were thus used for multi-conformation VS.

12

Accordingly, a total of 6 conformations for S-RBD of the Spike glycoprotein and 4

13

conformations for TMPRSS2 were considered for the following virtual screening (see

14

Material and Methods section for additional information about clusters selection). For all

15

the other targets, only the energy minimized crystallographic structure was considered

16

(Table S1 and Table S2 of the supporting information).

17

All targets were subjected to a three-staged virtual screening protocol consisting on a

18

preliminary docking by using the SP Glide docking algorithm, a second docking by

19

applying the XP Glide docking algorithms and a final rescoring by applying the Prime

20

MM-GBSA method. For each screened target, the 50 best ranked FDA drugs according

21

to the MM-GBSA score were preliminary selected. Among them, compounds intended

22

for a veterinary and/or cosmetic use, biocides, laxative or topical-administered drugs

23

were not considered for SARS-CoV-2 in vitro assays. The complete list for the 173

24

selected drugs and their potential target(s) emerged from VS is shown in Table S3 of

25

the supporting information. These compounds were experimentally assayed for their

26

SARS-CoV-2 antiviral potential within the framework of a host-directed COVID-19

27

antiviral therapy.

SARS-CoV-2 antiviral candidate biological evaluation: experimental screening and

31

Selected candidates were evaluated for their antiviral activity in a cell culture model of

32

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cytopathic effect was determined in Vero-E6 cells, which are

33

particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection with a high viral load resulting in

34

general cell death after 72 hours of infection. This cell death can be readily delayed and

35

even prevented by treatment with reference antiviral compounds and may be used to

36

identify new antivirals (12). Thus, antiviral activity of new drugs can be revealed by the

37

ability of a given compound to protect the cell monolayer upon infection. In order to

effectively determine the antiviral potential of FDA-approved drugs identified by the multi-

2

target virtual screening described above, we tested the 173 candidates for their ability to

3

protect Vero-E6 cells from virus-induced cell death at a fixed concentration of 10 µM.

4

Infected cell monolayer integrity was assessed by crystal violet staining 72 hours after

5

inoculation at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001. This analysis revealed 26

6

compounds that prevented virus-induced cell death at 10 µM and 7 compounds that were

7

cytotoxic at this concentration (Table S3 of the supporting information).

8

Both sets of compounds were counterscreened in a dose-response experiment to

9

determine the range of concentrations capable of protecting the cell monolayer and to

10

confirm their antiviral potential (Table S3). Only one of the cytotoxic compounds,

11

lanatoside C, revealed antiviral activity at lower concentrations, while the other 6

12

cytotoxic drugs did not reveal any protective activity. Furthermore, 5 of the primary hits

13

(thiostrepton, dipyridamole, hycanthone, gefitinib and pirenpirone) could not be

14

confirmed at any of the assayed doses. Thus, this study confirmed the prevention of

15

cytopathic effect caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells of a total of 22 FDA-approved

16

drugs and enabled the estimation of the maximum and minimum protective

17

concentrations (PCmax and PCmin respectively), providing a preliminary assessment of

18

the protective dose range of the 22 candidates (Table 1).

compatible with an MTT activity comparable to that observed in the vehicle-treated cells

2

(± 20%; highest non-toxic concentration) and the concentration at which 50% of the MTT

3

values are reached (CC50). This analysis suggested that metergoline, carvedilol and

4

tilorone interfered significantly with cell viability and were not selected for further

5

characterization. Several of the rest of the compounds like niclosamide, posaconazole,

6

loratadine, mycophenolate mofetil and ivermectin showed borderline MTT values or

7

values outside the range defined by the vehicle control (Figure S2), probably as a sign

8

of metabolic adaptation to compound-induced stress. Given that the protection assay is

9

an indirect assay that may be altered by stress-induced metabolic alterations and

10

cytotoxicity, all the compounds with the exception of the three ones that interfered with

11

the cell viability were subjected to direct evaluation of their antiviral activity at non-

12

cytotoxic concentrations with antiviral potential, i.e. protective capacity.

13
14

Antiviral activity of selected candidates

15

In order to directly confirm the antiviral activity of the remaining 19 compounds, viral

16

antigen expression in vehicle or candidate-treated cells was assessed by

17

immunofluorescence microscopy using an antibody raised against SARS-CoV-2

18

nucleoprotein (N). Infections were carried out at a MOI of 0.01 and cells were fixed at 24

19

hours post inoculation, time at which no virus-induced cytopathic effect is observed. At

20

this time of infection and MOI, the infection has locally spread in Vero-E6 and may be

21

visualized by the expression of N protein (Figure 3A). Compound doses were carefully

22

selected based on the data showed in Figure S2 and Table 1 to determine their antiviral

23

potential at doses resulting in MTT assay values within the control range. Automated

24

imaging enabled the visualization and quantification of the infection efficiency as a

25

function of N protein expression in the presence/absence of the compounds. As shown

26

in Figure 3, this analysis clearly confirmed antiviral activity of cepharantine (12.5 and

27

6.25 µM), protoporphyrin IX (25 and 12.5 µM) and lanatoside C (3.12 and 1.56 µM) which

28

substantially reduced N protein accumulation in infected cells at the assayed

29

concentrations, in a similar way as the positive control remdesivir (5 and 2.5 µM), a

30

nucleotide analog repurposed for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection (32). In

31

addition, antiviral activity could be confirmed for one of the doses of terfenadine (12.5

32

µM), ebastine (12.5 µM), amoxapine (25 µM), penfluridol (6.25 µM), imatinib (25 µM),

33

accumulation. In this sense, loratadine and ivermectin showed antiviral activity at doses

2

where the cell number, determined by DAPI staining, was clearly reduced, suggesting

3

that they have a measurable impact on cell viability at the active concentrations, an effect

that disappears in the 1:2 dilution together with the antiviral activity. These results confirm

the narrow window observed in Figure S2 for these compounds.

These results suggest that, while protection of the cell monolayer is a valid primary

showed intermediate activities that required further confirmation by independent assays

to confirm their antiviral potential.

Determination of viral load reduction by candidate compound treatment in SARS-

17

CoV-2 -infected cells

18

To independently confirm the antiviral activity of compounds that substantially reduced

19

infection efficiency and in order to verify the ability of the compounds to interfere with

20

overall virus propagation, Vero-E6 cells were inoculated at MOI of 0.001 and cultured in

21

the presence of a selection of the antiviral candidates for 48 hours, time at which total

22

RNA was extracted to determine viral load by quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 4). Viral RNA

23

accumulation in this setup is proportional to the ability of the virus to propagate in the cell

24

monolayer in multiple rounds of infection. Viral load was reduced by more than three

25

orders of magnitude in cells treated with the positive control, remdesivir. As expected

26

from the reduced viral antigen expression shown in Figure 3, cepharantine-, lanatoside

27

C-, and protoporphyrin IX-treated cells showed strong reduction in the viral RNA load.

28

Similarly, antiviral doses of efloxate, imatinib and pimozide, also reduced viral RNA load,

29

further underscoring their antiviral potential, albeit at much defined doses. On the other

30

hand, digoxin-treated cells showed viral RNA levels comparable to those found in

31

vehicle-treated cells, confirming that its protective activity (Table 1) is not associated with

32

a measurable antiviral activity. Niclosamide-treated cells only showed a marginal

33

reduction in viral RNA content, which together with its MTT dose-response profile

34

precludes unambiguously concluding on the antiviral potential of this compound in cell

35

culture. Regarding the compounds that showed intermediate activity in Figure 3,

36

clofazimine treatment strongly interfered with SARS-CoV-2 propagation at several

37

concentrations, as shown by intracellular viral RNA levels that were reduced by two

orders of magnitude at the maximum assayed concentration (50 µM; Figure 4). These

2

results confirm that clofazimine shows antiviral activity at several non-cytotoxic doses

3

and that its intrinsic fluorescence (33) may have interfered with the interpretation of the

4

immunofluorescence results shown in Figure 3. In contrast, mycophenolate mofetil

showed limited antiviral activity at the highest assayed concentration, underscoring the

notion that this compound may interfere with viral propagation with limited efficacy in this

experimental setup.

Evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs as entry inhibitors

lysates were assayed to determine luciferase activity as a reporter activity for viral entry.

Data are shown as average and standard deviation of a minimum of two independent

4

experiments performed in triplicate (N=6). Statistical significance was evaluated using a

5

one-way ANOVA and a Dunnet’s post-hoc test.

7

Analysis of the pseudotype entry efficiency shows that lapatinib, mycophenolate mofetil

8

and protoporphyrin IX interfere with the entry assay in a non-selective manner, which

9

precludes studying them using this system (Figure 5). Similarly, the results obtained with

10

lanatoside C, were variable and inconclusive, suggesting that this compound may also

11

interfere non-specifically with the assay (Figure 5).

12

Among the rest of the tested compounds, cepharantine, imatinib and efloxate showed

13

the greatest antiviral activity and relative selectivity for Spp entry as compared with the

14

controls (Figure 5), indicating that they are indeed SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors.

15

Amoxapine, pimozide, penfluridol, terfenadine and reserpine, inhibit Spp entry by 3-5

16

folds as compared with the vehicle, and only marginally interfere with entry of the control

17

pseudotypes VSVpp and RD114pp. In this sense, reserpine, terfenadine, clofazimine

18

(VSVpp) and ebastine (RD114pp) caused a statistically significant difference with one of

19

the control pseudotypes (Figure 5) but with a magnitude that can be distinguished from

20

that observed in Spp, suggesting some degree of selectivity. This reduced selectivity

21

probably reflects the small therapeutic window observed for these compounds (Table 1

22

and Figure 3).

23

Overall, our results support the notion that the compounds selected by the screening

24

procedure described above, with the exception of lapatinib, mycophenolate mofetil,

25

protoporphyrin IX and lanatoside C, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by interfering with viral

Since its first detection in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei

30

province, COVID-19 has spread worldwide rapidly. The outbreak was declared a Public

31

Health Emergency by WHO on 30 January 2020 and since then, utmost efforts were

made by the international scientific community in the attempt to find an effective cure.

The full characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome by Fuk-Woo Chan J. and

1

infections with small molecules is a valid approach, but it is affected by important

2

disadvantages, such as low potency and emergence of drug-resistant virus variants,

3

especially when applied as monotherapy. These limitations could be dampened by the

4

application of broad-spectrum antiviral agents simultaneously acting on more than one

5

target at the same time (37). Furthermore, to reduce the likelihood of resistance in future

6

treatments, the design of antivirals able to block host targets involved in viral infection is

7

an emerging and promising strategy (38). In fact, this is the approach followed in this

8

study. Thus, we screened in silico the same chemical library against eight different entry

9

SARS-CoV-2 targets, being all of them human proteins.

10

Specifically, to fight against COVID-19 great attention was paid to molecular events

11

associated to virus entry, which are primarily mediated by the S glycoprotein. According

12

to recent studies, S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is translated into an uncleaved and inactive

13

form (S0) (39), which is generally activated by proteolytic cleavage by host proteases

14

such as TMPRSS2 during protein egress (15). Once primed and exposed on the viral

15

membrane, the fusion event can occur and is initiated by recognition of specific host

16

receptors as ACE2 (39) by the receptor binding domain (S1-RBD), located at the S1

17

subunit of the protein. The priming activity can also be managed by other host proteases

18

as furin, and Cathepsin L in a compensatory mechanism. After host-virus recognition,

19

the viral material is internalized by endocytosis and trafficked into the host cell. This

20

process is mediated by several host factors, which are currently a matter of intense

21

investigation for their pharmacological suitability as anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets.

22

In this direction, inhibitors of the host proteases TMPRSS2, furin and Cathepsin L, the

23

kinases AAK-1, GAK and PIKfyve as well as TPC2 ion channel may offer the possibility

24

to act at different levels during virus attachment, endocytosis and trafficking.

25

Following this trend, a hierarchical host-directed virtual screening protocol was applied

26

to select potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs based on the above-mentioned host targets

27

with the aim to find a host-based therapy for COVID-19 capable to interfere with virus

28

attachment, endocytosis and trafficking. In this regard, 173 FDA approved drugs were

29

selected from the multi-target in silico virtual screening conducted on a library of 1789

30

drugs and finally tested against SARS-CoV-2 viral infection using a high-throughput

31

screening (HTS) protocol which was optimized for this work.

32

The potential antiviral activity of the 173 FDA-approved drugs selected during VS was

33

first evaluated in a cell culture model of SARS-CoV-2 infection at a fixed concentration

34

of 10 µM. Vero-E6 cells were selected because of the proven susceptibility to the

35

infection by this coronavirus. This preliminary assay yielded 26 hits (Table S3) and

36

subsequent dose-response experiment to determine the range of protective

37

concentration allowed the confirmation of 22 candidates for further studies (Table 1).

1

The next step in the characterization of our drug candidates was the determination of

2

maximum and minimum compound concentration where cells are protected from SARS-

3

CoV-2-induced cell death (PCmax and PCmin) together with the cytotoxic concentration

4

(CC50) by MTT assay in order to determine the therapeutic window of the candidates

5

(Table 1). From these assays, the five drugs imatinib, protoporphyrin IX, lanatoside C,

6

cepharantine and clofazimine showed a clear protective activity at non-toxic

7

concentrations, while other three, posaconazole, carvedilol and tilorone, were discarded

8

for further characterization due to the clear lack of therapeutic window in the

9

experimental conditions used. These drugs were proposed in the literature as potential

10

anti-COVID19 agents based mainly on their primary mechanism of action, but none of

11

them was tested previously against SARS-CoV-2 (40, 41). In the case of tilorone, no

12

therapeutic window was found, thus precluding demonstrating antiviral activity in this cell

13

culture system, which is in line with other already published reports (11).

14

Confirmation of antiviral activity for the 19 selected compounds was performed by

15

immunofluorescence microscopy using an antibody capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2

16

nucleoprotein (N) in infected cells and intracellular viral RNA quantification by RT-qPCR.

17

Results from both experiments (Figures 3 and 4) confirmed that except for loratadine,

18

ivermectin, niclosamide and digoxin, the rest of the compounds showed viral inhibition

19

at non-toxic concentrations. Surprisingly, the lack of antiviral activity found for ivermectin,

20

which was hypothesized to inhibit ACE2-S-RBD interaction according to our VS,

21

contrasts with the antiviral activity on SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate Australia/VIC01/2020

22

reported in Vero/hSLAM cells (42). Further clinical trials of ivermectin for COVID-19 are

23

ongoing (43), and only these results when available will assess the anti-SARS-CoV-2

24

efficacy of this broad spectrum antiparasitic agent. Curiously, no clinical benefit was

25

reported in a recent phase III study of ivermectin in Thailand conducted on dengue virus-

26

infected patients (44).

27

Finally, a specific assay consisting on S protein pseudotyped retroviral vectors was set

28

up to gain deeper knowledge about the potential ability of identified antivirals to inhibit

29

SARS-CoV-2 entry. In these experiments, VSV-G and RD114 pseudotypes were used

30

as controls. VSV-G pseudotypes use the endocytic pathway to enter the cells through a

31

different receptor that S-pseudotypes. RD114-pseudotypes are internalized after direct

32

fusion of the viral envelope with the cell plasma membrane. Overall, the results of the

33

pseudotype entry efficiency (Figure 5) indicated that all the selected drugs inhibit SARS-

34

CoV-2 infection by interfering with viral entry. Among those, cepharantine, imatinib and

35

efloxate were the best compounds and displayed a superior selectivity as compared with

36

the rest of the entry inhibitors.

1

Cepharantine was approved in Japan to treat alopecia (45), which was proposed in the

2

last months as anti-COVID-19 therapy based on theoretical and in vitro results (11). Our

3

in silico results showed that cepharantine could be a potential inhibitor of furin and TPC2,

4

being its biological action involved not only in first entry phases but also in the escape

5

from late endosomes, a mechanism that is compatible with the results obtained in the

6

surrogate model of viral entry here presented.

7

Due to the involvement of Abl pathway in viral infections, imatinib was proposed as anti-

8

SARS-CoV-2 and clinical trials were started since the first moment of the pandemic (46),

9

although no experimental evidence of antiviral activity was reported. At the time of writing

10

this manuscript in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 has been described (47) in

11

agreement with the results here presented.

12

As far as we know, no antiviral activity has ever been reported for the vasodilator

13

efloxate. Our virtual screening shows that this drug could potentially inhibit AAK1 and

14

GAK kinases involved in early endosome entry.

15

Moreover, we have already shown that protoporphyrin IX and lanatoside C have also

16

good antiviral properties although their mechanism of action is not mediated by the

17

inhibition of the viral entry pathway. Both compounds have been previously described as

18

anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents in different studies (11, 48). Clofazimine, used as an

19

antimicrobial agent, also showed consistent antiviral activity and interfered significantly

20

with Spp and VSVpp but not RD114pp infection, suggesting a non-selective impact on

21

viral entry through the endosomal route.

22

Overall, the use of an FDA-approved chemical library allowed us to check the robustness

23

and reproducibility of our protocol, a multi-target virtual screening following by a solid

24

experimental cascade of biological assays. Our study allowed the identification and

25

experimental validation of valuable candidates to be repurposed as potential COVID-19

26

therapy such as cepharantine, efloxate, imatinib, protoporphyrin IX, clofazimine and

27

lanatoside C. Moreover, a potential mechanism of action for these drugs was also

28

proposed by in silico VS analyses as they would be able to modulate some of the host

29

proteins involved in the entry process of SARS-CoV-2 and was experimentally validated

30

for cepharantine, efloxate and imatinib.

31

In summary, we have identified a list of six drugs ready to be validated in clinical trials

32

as SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibitors. In case of positive results from clinical trials with

33

COVID-19 patients, these compounds may promote a new era of antiviral agents

34

potentially able to combat the current COVID-19 pandemic, but also future outbreaks of

35

high pathogenic viruses, which would share a common entry pathway as infection

36

mechanism.

Computational studies

3

The drug-dataset. A starting list of 1789 FDA-approved drugs (US Drug Collection,

4

MicroSource Discovery Systems) has been prepared for VS with the LigPrep and Epik

5

modules of Maestro suite (49). Accordingly, all possible ionization states at pH 7.2 ± 2.0

6

have been predicted for each compound. Original chirality has been retained. This led

7

to a total of 2627 compounds. The force field, OPLS3 (50) has been used to define all

8

the generated compounds.

9

Protein targets and MD simulations. The X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike

10

receptor binding domain in complex with ACE2 (PDB ID: 6M0J) (51) has been used as

11

model for the S1-RBD-ACE2 recognition surface.

12

For TMPRSS2, the homology modelled extracellular region of the protein was obtained

13

from the Swiss-Model repository (52). The model was obtained from the serine protease

14

hepsin (PDB ID: 5CE1), which shares the 34% of sequence identity with the target

15

protein, TMPRSS2.

16

Amber 18 (53) was used to explore the local conformational flexibility of the S1-RBD of

17

Spike and to refine the homology modelled structure of TMPRSS2. The ff14SB force

18

field (54) was used to define the proteins which were embedded in a truncated octahedral

19

TIP3P (55) water box in a layer of 22 Å and neutralized by adding chlorine counterions.

20

Disulphide bonds were built by using the “bond” command in tleap.

21

Protonation states for titratable residues were set according to Propka (56) predictions

22

at pH 7.3. Systems were energy minimized in three steps involving firstly all hydrogen

23

atoms, then water molecules, and finally all the system. For the final step, a maximum

24

of 50,000 (5,000 iterations with steepest descent and the rest with conjugate gradient)

25

were run. Thermalization of the minimized systems from 0 to 300 K was accomplished

26

in five steps, the first being performed at constant volume and the rest at constant

27

pressure. Langevin dynamics with a collision frequency of 1.0 ps-1 was applied for

28

temperature regulation during thermalization. Prior to MD, 5 ns of equilibration at

29

constant pressure were run to properly stabilize the systems. A total of 100 ns of MD

30

production were generated in the NVT ensemble and in periodic boundary conditions for

31

both systems. A time step of 2 fs was set for saving trajectories.

32

The SHAKE algorithm (57) was applied to constrain bonds involving hydrogen atoms.

33

Cut-off for non-bonded interactions was set to 10 Å. Electrostatic interactions beyond the

34

cut-off within the periodic box were computed by applying the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME)

35

method (58). The weak-coupling algorithm with a time constant of 10.0 ps was used to

36

stabilize the temperature during the simulation. Trajectories analysis and clusterization

37

were done by using the CPPTRAJ module of Amber18. For clustering analysis, a total

of 10 clusters were preliminary searched by using the average linkage algorithm, which

2

uses the average distance between members of two clusters (59). Representative

3

structure for each cluster was represented by the average structure. Cut-off for

4

determining local density was set at 4 angstroms. Parameters for clusterization were

5

adapted considering both trajectory and protein length.

6

For human PIKfyve, the structure of the protein has been obtained by homology

7

modeling by using the crystal structure of zebrafish Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-

8

kinase alpha isoform with bound ATP/Ca2+ (PDEB code: 6CMW), which shares the 28%

9

of global sequence identity (60). To proper refine the ATP binding site in the homology

10

modelled PIKfyve enzyme, ATP has been accommodated in its binding site by using the

11

template complex as reference and the so derived PIKfyve-ATP complex has been then

12

energy minimized. The ATP parameters for minimization with Amber18 were taken from

13

the Amber parameter database of the Bryce group (61, 62). The complete list for all the

14

crystallographic structures used during VS is reported in Table S1.

15

Structure-based Virtual Screening (SBVS) and MM-GBSA rescoring. The complete FDA

16

database of 1789 approved drugs was screened against the previously described

17

targets. Representative 3D-structures/clusters for S1-RBD and TMPRSS2 were selected

18

from MD simulations. For cluster selection on S-RBD, clusters with a population higher

19

than 5% (clusters 0-4) were considered for VS with the aim to enhance the exploration

20

of the conformational variability of the receptor binding site of S protein. In case of

21

TMPRSS2, only those clusters were the active site was in an open state were

22

considered, 3 clusters (cluster 0-2) were finally selected for VS. For both systems, the

23

minimized structure was also considered for VS.

24

For the rest of the screened systems (AAK-1, Cathepsin-L, furin, GAK, PIKfyve and

25

TPC2), the minimized crystallographic structures were prepared for virtual screening with

26

the protein preparation wizard from the Maestro suite, applying the OPLS3e force field

27

(50) with default parameters. The grid boxes were centered on the active site for each

28

target (see Table S1) using default parameters for receptor grid generation.

29

SBVS was then performed by using a pipeline which included 3 stages. The first one

30

consisted in massive docking simulations employing the Glide software (63) and the

31

Standard Precision (SP) method. In this first stage, an enhanced sampling approach was

32

used, and 5 poses were generated per compound state. The best 50% of compounds

33

(according to the scoring function) were kept and used for the second stage, where the

34

Extra Precision (XP) method was employed. In the second stage, 25% of the best-ranked

35

solutions were kept. Rescoring was performed in the third stage with Prime MM-GBSA

36

method (64).

SARS-CoV-2 infection assays

2

All infection experiments were performed by inoculating Vero-E6 cells seeded onto 96-

3

well plates (2x104 cells/well) with the SARS-CoV-2 strain NL/2020 (kindly provided by

4

Dr. R. Molenkamp, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam) at low multiplicity of

5

infection (MOI) of 0.01 or 0.001, as indicated below. Cultures were maintained at 37 ºC

6

in a 5% CO2 incubator for different lengths of time depending on the experiment.

7

Compounds were diluted from 10 mM stock solutions in complete media containing 2%

8

FBS to achieve the indicated final concentrations.

9

Cell monolayer protection assays: Vero-E6 cell monolayers were inoculated at MOI

10

0.001 in the presence of 10 µM of each compound in duplicate wells. Seventy-two hours

11

later the cells were fixed and stained using crystal violet. Compounds that protect from

12

the virus induced cell death were selected for further experiments. A wide range of

13

compound concentrations (from 50 to 0.78 µM) from the selected compounds were used

14

in subsequent experiments to determine the maximum and minimum protective

15

concentration (PCmax and PCmin) as indicated above.

16

Cytotoxicity measurement by MTT assays: Vero-E6 cell monolayers were treated with a

17

wide range of compound concentrations (from 50 to 0.78 µM) and forty-eight hours later

18

they were subjected to MTT assays following the manufacturer’s instructions.

19

Intracellular viral RNA quantitation: To confirm that protection of the monolayer was

20

indeed due to the ability of the compounds to restrict virus replication, viral RNA

21

quantitation was performed as indicated below. Vero-E6 cell monolayers were inoculated

22

at MOI 0.001 in the presence of the indicated compound concentrations. Forty-eight

23

hours later cell lysates were prepared using Trizol reagent (Thermo Scientific). Viral RNA

24

content was determined by RT-qPCR using previously validated sets of primers and

25

probes specific for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene (65) and the cellular 28S

26

RNA for normalization purposes. DCt method was used for relative quantitation of the

27

intracellular viral RNA accumulation in compound-treated cells compared to the levels in

28

infected cells treated with DMSO, set as 100%.

29

Hit validation by immunofluorescence microscopy.

30

VeroE6 were seeded onto 96-well plates as described above and infected in the

31

presence of the indicated compound dose (MOI 0.01). Twenty-four hours post infection,

32

cells were fixed for 20 minutes at RT with a 4% formaldehyde solution in PBS, washed

33

twice with PBS and incubated with incubation buffer (3% BSA; 0.3% Triton X100 in PBS)

34

for 1 hour. A monoclonal antibody against N protein was diluted in incubation buffer

35

(1:2000; Genetex HL344) and incubated with the cells for 1 hour, time after which the

36

cells were washed with PBS and subsequently incubated with a 1:500 dilution of a goat

37

anti-mouse conjugated to Alexa 488 (Invitrogen-Carlsbad, CA). Nuclei were stained with

SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-pseudotyped retroviral vectors

6

Retroviral particle production pseudotyped with different viral envelopes has previously

7

been described (66, 67). Packaging plasmids, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G and

8

RD114 glycoprotein expressing plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. F. L. Cosset

9

(INSERM, Lyon). SARS-CoV-2 S expressing plasmid was obtained from Jose María

10

Casanovas and Juan García Arriaza (CNB-CSIC). Particles devoid of envelope

11

glycoproteins were produced in parallel as controls.

12

For SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped particle (SARS2pp) entry experiments, Vero-E6

13

cells (104 cells/well) were seeded onto 96-well plates the day before. Compounds were

14

diluted in complete media [(DMEM supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 1x non-essential

15

amino acids (Gibco), 100 U/ mL penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) and 10% Fetal Bovine

16

Serum (heat-inactivated at 56 ºC for 30 min)] to achieve a 2x concentration. Fifty

17

microliters (50 µL) of the SARS2pp, VSVpp or RD114 retrovirus dilutions were mixed 1:1

18

with 50 µL of the 2x compound dilutions to achieve the desired final compound

19

concentrations, as indicated in the figure. One hundred µL of the mixture was applied

20

onto the Vero E6 cell monolayer in biological triplicates and cells were cultured at 37 ºC

21

in a 5% CO2 incubator. Forty-eight hours post-inoculation, cells were lysed for luciferase

22

activity determination using Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and a luminometer.

23

Relative infection values were determined by normalizing the data to the average relative

24

light units detected in the vehicle control cells.
