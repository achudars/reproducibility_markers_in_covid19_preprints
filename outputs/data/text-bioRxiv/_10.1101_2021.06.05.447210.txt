Aerosols contain human pathogens that cause public health disasters such as tuberculosis (TB)
and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The current technologies for the collection of viruses
and microorganisms in aerosols face critical limitations, necessitating the development of a new
type of sampling system to advance the capture technology. Herein, we presented a new type of
collection system, which exploits the affinity between carbon chains and organic molecules on
the surfaces of viruses and microorganisms. We demonstrated that the physical capture
efficiency of the collection system was over 99% for particle sizes from 0.3 to 10 µm. We further
evaluated the biochemical capture efficiency of the collection system using mass spectrometry
approaches and showed that the biochemical information of viruses and microorganisms was
well preserved. Coupled with well-established molecular technologies, this new type of capture
technology can be used for the investigation of aerosol-related disease transmission models, as
well as the development of innovative screening and monitoring tools for human diseases and
public health issues.
INTRODUCTION
Particle-containing aerosols are small-size liquid or solid particles suspended in air. Mounting
evidence suggests that viruses and microorganisms are present in aerosols and play a notorious
role in airborne disease transmission, including tuberculosis (TB), seasonal influenza, and
COVID-19 pandemic.1-5 Therefore, understanding the biological role of aerosol particles is
imperative to the development of prevention and treatment strategies for public health
agencies.
Physical properties of aerosol particles are explored for the development of aerosol
collection devices, which includes the most widely used types such as impactors, impingers, and
membrane filters.6-10 In impactor and cyclone-type devices, particles in the air are maneuvered
into an aerosol beam, accelerated through several stages of impactors equipped with nozzles
decreasing in size sequentially, and deposited onto a collection surface.11 The analytes are
extracted from the collection surface and analyzed with different molecular techniques.11 In
impinger-type samplers, aerosol particles are directed into a liquid solution, and the collection
is accomplished via the diffusion between air bubbles and the liquid medium.9 Since collected
viruses and microorganisms are maintained in the liquid medium, cell culture assays can be
conducted directly without extra extraction steps.12 Although impactors and liquid impingers
are the most widely used devices for the collection of virus and microorganism-containing
aerosol particles, they are disadvantageous due to their incomplete capture of particles of all
sizes.12 For example, the cut-off size for impactors, identified by the resolution of nozzles, is the
major challenge for the efficient collection of particles of very small diameter (<1 m), and reaerosolization during diffusion in impingers causes significant virus losses as flow rate
increases.12 Fibrous filter-based technologies, such as electrets and Teflon filters, have been
used for the development of portable aerosol collection systems.10 However, it is concluded that
environmental humidity directly causes the pressure drop, as liquid or biological materials
accumulate on fibrous filters, resulting in a dramatic efficiency reduction overtime. In addition,

releasing of captured materials by the filter-based methds requires rigid extraction protocols
that causes protein degradations. 10 Given these limitations, a sampling device that can collect
aerosol particles in a comprehensive and complete fashion is needed.
The cell surface of a bacterium, independent of the type, is composed of various
structures of organics such as the wax-like mycolic acid coating on mycobacterium
tuberculosis.13,14 Those organic molecules are hydrophobic and show an outstanding affinity to
alkyl chains maintained by hydrogen bonds in the water phase. This chemical feature has been
employed in the analytical chemistry community for the development of retention apparatuses
such as liquid chromatography columns and solid-phase extraction technologies.15-17
Nevertheless, the current sampling methods for the collection of viruses and microorganisms in
aerosol particles entirely rely on physical properties. Methods exploiting chemical properties
have not been fully explored. In this study, a carbon-chain-based system was developed and
evaluated for the collection of viruses and microorganisms in aerosol particles. The collection
system was applied to representative organisms, and the physical and biochemical collection
efficiencies were evaluated using mass spectrometry approaches.
EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Materials. All LC-grade solvents and chemicals were acquired commercially from Fisher
Chemical (Waltham, MA). C18 resin beads (ID 12-20 µm) were purchased from Hamilton
(Reno, NV). The 10 µm pore-size filter discs and the column sets were acquired commercially
(Boca Scientific, Dedham, MA). Escherichia coli bacteriophage MS2 was purchased from ATCC
(Manassas, VA). Escherichia coli K12, Pseudomonas fluorescens 1013, and Yersinia rohdei CDC
3022-85 were acquired from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Virus
titer and bacterium concentration information is provided in the online methods (Table S1).
Aerosol generation and collection. The simulation of aerosol generation and collection was
presented in Figure 1. Briefly, viruses and microorganisms were prepared in MS-grade water.
The samples were loaded into an industrial Sono-Tek ultrasonic nozzle (Milton, NY; online
method) to generated virus and microorganism-containing aerosols into a releasing chamber, a
50-mL conical tube. For the aerosol collection, a column (0.6 mm ID) packed with 25 mg of
C18 resin beads (Figure 1a) was installed on the bottom of the releasing chamber and pulled by
as diaphragm pump in a flow rate of 500 mL/min. The filters and C18 resin beads used in the
current study were carefully evaluated to avoid significant pressure drop (Supporting
information). A portable laser air particle counter (MetOne Instruments, Grants Pass, OR) was
used to measure particle sizes from 0.3 to 10 µm. To avoid extra water vapors fusing into the
diaphragm pump, a condensate collection cup, incubated in ice water, was installed after the
collection column. When the collection was complete, the column was carefully removed from
the system and washed with 400 µL of water three times. The wash samples were saved. The
final collection products were eluted with 200 µL of 70% isopropanol into a 1.5-mL
microcentrifugation tube. Samples were saved for mass spectrometric analysis.
Mass spectrometric analysis of viruses and microorganisms. The protocols for the wholecell MAIDL-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of the virus and bacteria have been well
established and described in previous studies and the online methods.18-20 MALDI-TOF mass
spectra were acquired using a Shimadzu Axima CFR-plus mass spectrometer in the linear mode
from 1000 to 15,000 m/z. For direct infusion and nanoflow LC mass spectrometry, a LTQ
orbitrap system coupling with an EASY-nLC 1000 system was used (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The flow rate for direct infusion was set to 3 µL/min. For LC-MS analysis, samples were
injected into a microflow C18 column (Acclaim™ PepMap™ 100, 75 µm x 2 µm x 250 mm,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) and proteins were separated using a gradient of solvent B (99%

acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) from 5 to 65% in 90 minutes using an EASY-nLC 1000
system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Ion fragmentation was conducted using collision-induced
dissociation (CID). To improve ion fragmentation coverage, a staged-CID approach was used,
where the top-down mass spectra were acquired using collision energies of 0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30,
and 35%, respectively. Monoisotopic masses were deconvoluted using Xcalibur software 3.0
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the fragmentation ions were interpreted using ProSight Lite
(northwestern.edu).20,21 For richer details on top-down mass spectrometric data analysis, the
reader may refer to our previous studies and the supplemental information.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Evaluation of the physical capture efficiency on virus and microorganism-containing
aerosol particles. Aerosol particles have a wide range of size distribution from sub-micro to
hundreds of microns.23 As such, a collection system ought to be advanced enough to capture
particles of all sizes in a comprehensive fashion. To evaluate the physical capture efficiency of
our collection system, we generated aerosol particles that contained viruses and
microorganisms ranging from 0.3 to 10 µm and measured the particle counts before and after
the collection. The particle counts for MS2-containing aerosol before using the collection
system were 3921, 4236, 15232, 17892, 1250, and 365 cubic feet (ft3, CF) at the particle sizes of

0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 µm, respectively (Figure 1d, dark dots; Table S2). After the
collection, the particle counts dropped to 12, 10, 52, 7, 2, and 0 CF from 0.3 to 10.0 µm,
suggesting that >99% MS2-containing aerosol particles were captured (Figure 1d, red dots;
Table S2). The same high-capture efficiency was also observed using E. coli-containing aerosol
particles (Figure 1d, grey and blue dots; Table S2). Previous studies have shown that the
capture of very small-size particles (<1 µm) is an outstanding challenge for current aerosol
sampling technologies. Consequently, achieving a rigorous capture of particles from 0.3 to 10.0
µm underscores a major advantage of our collection system12. Several factors contribute to the
excellent capture efficiency of this collection system. The packed C18 resin beads are 12-20 µm
in diameter, resulting in 0.3 µm to 25 µm in pose size of the column, depending on the shape of
the beads. The length of the packed beads is around 3 mm, and this design provides a longer
contacting path and expands the contact areas to much larger capacities than filter membranebased collection systems which has a thickness less than 0.1 mm (us.vwr.com). 23 This physical
characteristic of the column provides a comprehensive coverage of all size aerosol particles,
contributing to a complete capture.
Capture of MS2 and bacteria using the collection system revealed by mass spectrometry.
Three types of bacteria were aerosolized to generate particles and characterized using MALDITOF mass spectrometry after the collection (Figure 2). The results showed that reported
bacterium signatures were well observed in elution samples with MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometry (Figure 2). 24-27 To rule out the possibility of carry-over and cross-contamination,
samples collected from the wash steps were evaluated and no bacterium signatures were
observed in those samples (Figure 2, middle images). In fact, after a quick centrifugation on the
elution samples, bacterium materials can be visualized as pale pellets on the bottom of the tube,
which highlights the exceedingly strong capture capacity of the collection system (Figure S1).
In addition, the signal-to-noise ratios between the control and elution samples were
indistinguishable in all three bacterium types, suggesting that the captures were complete and
all bio-materials were well-preserved in the collection (Figure 2). By using three types of
bacteria, we demonstrated that our collection system has the capacity to capture
microorganisms in aerosol particles in an unexpurgated fashion.

and wash steps using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Certain non-physical
contact transmission cases suggest the virus may be contained in air aerosols and travel for a
long distance to cause the infection.28 Therefore, it is of great importance to develop a device

that has the capacity to capture viruses in aerosol particles. Since most viruses contain a protein
shell, granting the certainty that our collection system ought to be able to thoroughly capture
capacity to capture viruses thoroughly.18 In our study, MS2 was used as a representative virus
model to evaluate the capture capacity of our collection system. It should be noted that MS2 is
a small size virus (~27 nm) and thus more physically challenging to capture than larger viruses
such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and influenza viruses. MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometric analysis showed that the historical biomarker of MS2, capsid protein, was
observed in the elution sample after the collection (Figure 3a). 18 The identity of MS2 capsid
protein was unanimously confirmed using a top-down mass spectrometry approach in which
high-confidence statistical scores were constructed by matching the experimental
fragmentation ions to in silico protein fragmentation patterns (Figure 3b). Whole-cell MALDITOF mass spectrometry characterization and top-down protein identification confirmed that
our collection system has the capacity to capture viruses in aerosol particles.
Evaluation of the biochemical capture efficiency on viruses and microorganisms in
aerosol particles. The success of using the collection system to capture three types of bacteria
and the virus in aerosol particles motivated the investigation of the biochemical capture
efficiency in a more quantitative way. For this purpose, targeted ion intensities generated in
two sample introduction methods in top-down mass spectrometry, direct infusion and nanoflow
LC mass spectrometry were used for the quantitative analysis. Direct infusion mass
spectrometric analysis showed that the signal intensity of the referee insulin was around 3.6E6
(Figures 3c and d, dark dots). The signal intensity of MS2 capsid protein was around 1.1E5 in
both control and capture samples, suggesting no obvious sample loss during the collection
(Figures 3c and d, red and blue dots). This observation was further confirmed in the nano-flow
LC mass spectrometry, the gold standard for molecule quantitative analysis. The results
showed that the peak areas and ion intensities of MS2 capsid protein were identical between the
control and capture samples, suggesting that the collection system preserved a high
biochemical capture efficiency (Figures 3e and f). Several factors could contribute to the
superior capture efficiency of our collection system. It is well known that C18 materials show
great retention capacity to organic molecules as 25 mg of C18 resin beads used in our study
could support as much as 2.5 mg of organic materials.29 As previously described, the thickness
of the packed C18 resin beads allows a longer retention time and thus guarantees complete
contact between carbon chains and organic molecules on the surfaces of viruses. In addition,
aerosol particles and the contained viruses and microorganisms were directly exposed to the
capture materials, which minimized the “wall-losses” effect that is present in other aerosol
technologies where particles are deposited on the side of the device rather than being
collected.12 Our quantitative analysis on MS2 capsid protein demonstrated that the biochemical
capture efficiency of the collection system was outstanding.

CONCLUSIONS
In this study we presented a new type of collection system for the high-efficiency capture of
viruses and microorganisms in aerosol particles. The collection system has the capacity to
collect aerosol particles of all sizes while preserving biochemical information. This collection
system is simple and thus gives fresh impetus for the development of a rapid point-of-care
device for the collection of viruses contained in human breath and aerosols, particularly aimed
at seasonal flu infection and the current COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we demonstrated
the effectiveness of the collection system using mass spectrometry approaches for the
identification of viruses and bacteria in aerosol particles. As expected, other molecular
technologies, such as nucleic acid amplification and immunoassay, can be feasibly applied to the
collection products for their identification.30,31 In addition, since no vacuum pump system is
applied in this collection system, it can be treated as a “soft technique” and thus the viability of
viruses and microorganisms can be preserved, suitable for microbiological culture studies.12
Human exhaled air produced from coughing or sneezing contains plenty of biological
materials.32-34 Therefore, the rich analysis of these biological materials is not limited by
analytical technologies but rather by a lack of an effective collection method.12, 35 Considering
the advantages of our collection system, this new type of collection system has a wide range of
applications, such as the investigation of airborne disease transmission mechanisms and the
development of diagnostic and monitoring tools for human diseases and environmental
hazards.
