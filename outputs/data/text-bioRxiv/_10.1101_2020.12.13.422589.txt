ABSTRACT
SARS-CoV-2 presence has been recently demonstrated in the sputum or saliva, suggesting how the
shedding of viral RNA outlasts the end of symptoms. Recent data from transcriptome analysis show
that oral cavity mucosa harbors high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, highlighting its role as a
double-edged sword for SARS-CoV-2 body entrance or interpersonal transmission. In the present
study, for the first time, we demonstrate the oral microbiota structure and inflammatory profile of
COVID-19 patients. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients and matched healthy controls underwent
naso/oral-pharyngeal and oral swabs. Microbiota structure was analyzed by 16S rRNA V2
automated targeted sequencing, while oral and sera concentrations of 27 cytokines were assessed
using magnetic bead-based multiplex immunoassays. A significant diminution in species richness
was observed in COVID-19 patients, along with a marked difference in beta-diversity. Species such
as Prevotella salivae and Veillonella infantium were distinctive for COVID-19 patients, while
Neisseria perflava and Granulicatella elegans were predominant in controls. Interestingly, these
two groups of oral species oppositely clustered within the bacterial network, defining two distinct
Species Interacting Group (SIGs). Pro-inflammatory cytokines were distinctive for COVID-19 in
both oral and serum samples, and we found a specific bacterial consortium able to counteract them,
following a novel index called C4 firstly proposed here. We even introduced a new parameter,
named CytoCOV, able to predict COVID-19 susceptibility for an unknown subject at 71% of power
with an AUC equal to 0.995. This pilot study evidenced a distinctive oral microbiota composition in
COVID-19 subjects, with a definite structural network in relation to secreted cytokines. Our results
would pave the way for a theranostic approach in fighting COVID-19, trying to enlighten the
intimate relationship among microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic established at the end of 2019, whose
etiological agent is SARS-CoV-2, a member of betacoronaviruses 1. COVID-19 is typically
characterized by i) symptoms of the lower respiratory tract 2; ii) a systemic ‘cytokine storm’ 3,4; iii)
neurological symptoms such as ageusia and hyposmia 2,5. Patients exhibiting an exaggerated form
of symptoms 6 showed greater levels of proinflammatory factors 1,7,8, and beside respiratory
illnesses, they may also have enteric symptoms and encephalitis5. Virus replication in the throat
particularly during the first 5 days of symptoms is strongly supported by identification of
transcribed subgenomic mRNA in throat swab samples. However, some reports suggest the
potential for pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission as consequence of a mild illness of the upper
respiratory tract. In this context, understanding the invasive process of the virus at the port of entry
represents the crucial point. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 have been recently demonstrated in the
sputum or “posterior oropharyngeal saliva” 9–12 indicating the shedding of viral RNA outlasted the
end of symptoms and the oral mucosa supports. Transcriptome analysis supports that expression of
COVID-19 ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors in salivary glands and epithelial cells showing the
potential vulnerability risk for oral cavity for lung or gut involvement 13. From these data, virus–
host interplay within the oral cavity seems to be a promising feature of COVID-19 pathogenesis,
forming the basis of disease severity and spread. The relationship between virus and host
environment included disturbance of resident bacterial community, event recently reported also in
gut from COVID-19 patients 14. As a consequence, a cascade of inflammatory markers is detected
specifically as a local cytokines pathway. The characterization of such a relationship might identify
physiological markers for the potential risk in terms of disease severity and therapeutic strategies. In
the present study, for the first time, we characterized the interplay of COVID-19 infection with oral
microbiota and inflammatory profile.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Cohort and Samples
A total of 26 patients, 6 women (mean age 66±16 years) and 20 men (mean age 66±15 years)
hospitalized at the Infectious Diseases Unit, University of Trieste, Italy, between April 10 th 2020
and May 5th 2020, tested positive for COVID-19, were selected for this study. All patients provided
informed consent for the use of their data and clinical samples for the purposes of the present study.
Patients acquired their infections upon known close contact to an index case, thereby avoiding
representational biases owing to symptom-based case definitions. All patients had interstitial
pneumonia and were receiving oxygen therapy but did not require endotracheal intubation and
invasive mechanical ventilation. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs for diagnosis of SARSCoV-2 were performed, and oral swab specimens touching tongue, palate and cheeks were
additionally collected two days after hospital admission for oral microbiota and local immune
response characterization. No mouth washing products were administered to the patients.
Specimens were additionally collected with the same modality from age-matched healthy
volunteers (n=15) without evaluable risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, sera samples from
11 infected patients with severe disease which underwent endotracheal intubation and invasive
mechanical ventilation, were additionally analyzed for peripheral cytokines profile.

SARS-CoV-2 Detection
SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed on the CFX96TM Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad, California, USA), using the NeoPlexTM COVID-19 Detection Kit (Genematrix, Seongnam,
Kyonggi-do, South Korea) targeting the viral N and RdRp genes and the housekeeping gene of βactin as internal control, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Soluble Immune Mediators Quantification
The profile of a panel of 27 cytokines including chemokines and growth factors was assessed in
duplicate, in oral swabs of positive and negative subjects for SARS-CoV-2 using magnetic beadbased multiplex immunoassays (Bio-Plex ProTM human cytokine 27-plex panel, Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Milan, Italy) according to the pre-optimized protocol 15. Briefly, the undiluted
samples (50 μl) were mixed with biomagnetic beads in 96-well flat-bottom plates, and after
incubation for 30 min at room temperature followed by washing plate with Bio-Plex wash buffer,
25 μl of the antibody–biotin reporter was added. After the addition of 50 μl of streptavidin–
phycoerythrin (PE) and following incubation for 10 min, the concentrations of the cytokines were
determined using the Bio-Plex-200 system (Bio-Rad Corp., United States) and Bio-Plex Manager
software (v.6, Bio-Rad). The data were expressed as median fluorescence intensity (MFI) and
concentration (pg/ml).
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression
The expression levels of human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes were evaluated by SYBR green PCR
analyses. In brief, RNA was reverse transcribed using SensiFast cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bioline), and
SYBR green PCR analysis was performed using Kapa HiFi HotStart Ready Mix (Roche) 16. The
housekeeping Beta-globin human gene was used for normalization and the relative expression
levels (ΔCt) of human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes were compared between groups.
DNA and RNA extraction
Total DNA and RNA were extracted starting from 300 μl and 200 μl of samples respectively, in a
final elution volume of 50 μl, using the Maxwell CSC Instrument (Promega Srl, Italy) and
following the manufacturer’s instructions. 50 μl of oral samples were additionally aliquoted for
profiling and quantification of soluble cytokines.
16S targeted sequencing
The V2–V3 portion of the 16S rRNA was amplified, using the primer set F101- R534,with a
different IonXpress barcode per sample attached to the reverse primer. PCR reactions were
performed using the Kapa Library Amplification Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Massachusetts, USA) and
BSA 400ng/µL, under the following conditions: 5 min at 95°C, 30 sec at 95°C, 30 sec at 59°C, 45
sec at 72°C and a final elongation step at 72°C for 10 min. DNA after normalization was quantified
with a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA). The amplicon size was
checked on a 2% agarose gel. The subsequent step of PCR purification was carried out using the
Mag-Bind® Total Pure NGS beads (OMEGA Bio-Tek, Georgia, USA), retaining fragments >100
bp. Template preparation was performed by the Ion PGM Hi-Q View kit on the Ion OneTouchTM 2
System (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, United States) and sequenced using the Ion PGM

Hi-Q View sequencing kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, United States) with the Ion
PGMTM System technology. Negative controls, including a no-template control, were processed
with the clinical samples 17.
Microbiota characterization
Raw FASTQ files were analyzed with DADA2 pipeline v.1.14 for quality check and filtering
(sequencing errors, denoising, chimera detection) on a Workstation Fujitsu Celsius R940 (Fujitsu,
Tokyo, Japan) (Figure S1). Filtering parameters were as follows: truncLen=0, minLen=100,
maxN=0, maxEE=2, truncQ=11, trimLeft=15. All the other parameters in the DADA2 pipeline for
single-end IonTorrent were left as default. Raw reads (2447325 in total, on average 59691 per
sample) were filtered (818531 in total, on average 19964 per sample) and 962 Amplicon Sequence
Variants (ASV) were found. Sample coverage was computed and resulted to be on average higher
than 99% for all samples, thus meaning a suitable normalization procedure for subsequent analyses.
Bioinformatic and statistical analyses on recognized ASV were performed with Python v.3.8.2.
Each ASV sequence underwent a nucleotide Blast using the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) Blast software (ncbi-blast-2.3.0) and the latest NCBI 16S Microbial Database
accessed at the end of July 2020 (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/). After blasting, the 962 ASVs
were merged into 122 species (thus excluding sub-species or strain differences), and a matrix of
their relative abundances was built for subsequent statistical analyses.
Network analysis
Pearson matrices for network analysis (metric = Bray-Curtis, method = complete linkage) were
generated on normalized and standardized data with in-house scripts (Python v3.8.2) and visualized
with Gephi v.0.9.2, as previously reported 18. Bacterial species having a prevalence ≥5% were
considered to generate the nodes within the final network, while a significant Pearson correlation
coefficient and its related P value (after Benjamini-Hochberg FDR at 10%) was employed to obtain
eight categories defining edge thickness 19. A leave-one-out method was employed by SciKit-learn
package v0.4.1 on the subjects in order to have an averaged P value for each correlation among two
definite variables. Network analysis was performed on unified datasets 18 taking care of an
optimized visual representation with Gephi v.0.9.2, as proposed by current guidelines 20–24. Nodes
were colored according to the cohort in which species harbored the highest mean relative
abundance, after normalization and standardization. The degree value, measuring the in/out number
of edges linked to a node, and the betweenness centrality, measuring how often a node appears on
the shortest paths between pairs of nodes in a network, were computed with Gephi v.0.9.2.
Intranetwork communities (here called Species Interacting Groups - ”SIGs” 18,25) were retrieved
using the Blondel community detection algorithm 26 by means of randomized composition and edge
weights, with a resolution equal to 1 27.
Statistical analysis
Data matrices (microbiota taxa or cytokines) were firstly normalized then standardized using
QuantileTransformer and StandardScaler methods from Sci-Kit learn package v0.20.3.
Normalization using the output_distribution='normal' option transforms each variable to a strictly
Gaussian-shaped distribution, whilst the standardization results in each normalized variable having
a mean of zero and variance of one. These two steps of normalization followed by standardization

ensure the proper comparison of variables with different dynamic ranges, such as bacterial relative
abundances, or cytokines levels. For microbiota analysis, measurements of α diversity (within
sample diversity) such as Richness and Shannon index, were calculated at species level using the
SciKit-learn package v.0.4.1. Exploratory analysis of β-diversity (between sample diversity) was
calculated using the Bray-Curtis measure of dissimilarity and represented in Principal Coordinate
Analyses (PCoA), along with methods to compare groups of multivariate sample units (analysis of
similarities - ANOSIM, permutational multivariate analysis of variance - PERMANOVA) to assess
significance in data points clustering 28. ANOSIM and PERMANOVA were automatically
calculated after 999 permutations, as implemented in SciKit-learn package v0.4.1. We implemented
Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and the subsequent Variable Importance Plot
(VIP) as a supervised analysis wherein the VIP values (order of magnitude) are used to identify the
most discriminant bacterial species among COVID-19 and control samples. Bar thickness reports
the fold ratio (FR) value of the mean relative abundances for each species among the two cohorts,
while an absent border indicates mean relative abundance of zero in the compared cohort. In order
to compare the microbiota species with cytokines levels, a multivariate statistical Pearson
correlation analysis (and related P values) was performed with custom scripts (Python v3.8.2), and a
Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA) with ‘Bray-Curtis’ metrics and ‘complete linkage’ method
was used to visualize putative cross-correlation clusters. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests
were employed to assess significance for pairwise or multiple comparisons, respectively,
considering a P value <0.05 as significant. Statistical analyses gathering more than two groups were
performed using ANOVA followed by pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni adjustments.
Differential enrichment analyses in murine studies were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing
using a two-stage Benjamini-Hochberg FDR at 10%.

RESULTS
Data relative to demographics and clinical data of enrolled patients at the time of samples collection
were resumed in Supplementary Table 1. Cardiac dysfunctions (14/26) and neurological
involvement (11/26) including ageusia or hyposmia (9/26) and paralysis and epilepsy (2/26)
represent the most frequently present comorbidities. Regarding drug therapies, all patients were
treated with hydroxychloroquine and 57.7% of them (15/26) received combinations with
antibiotics.
COVID19 patients harbor a distinctive oral microbiota
Following 16S targeted sequencing, we observed a significant diminution (-40%) of alpha-diversity
(species richness) in COVID-19 patients (P=2.92*10-2) (Figure 1A), while Shannon biodiversity
was unaltered. The unsupervised algorithm of Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) visually
represented a significant separation of COVID-19 oral samples from controls (P<1*10-3) (Figure
1B), thus meaning a different oral microbiota composition assessed with two different measures of
beta-diversity (ANOSIM and PERMANOVA). In order to find a pattern of bacterial species able to
describe the changes in microbiota composition of COVID-19 samples, we used the supervised
algorithm of Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), which generated a Variable
Importance Plot (VIP) showing the most important species able to separate the two cohorts (Figure
1C). Six bacterial species, having a VIP score higher than the chosen cutoff of 1.25, were

discriminant for COVID-19 (Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Veillonella infantium, Soonwooa
purpurea, Prevotella salivae, Prevotella jejuni, Capnocytophaga gingivalis), while several species
(n=23) were significantly distinctive for controls (the most important being Neisseria perflava,
Lampropedia puyangensis, Rothia mucilaginosa, Kallipyga gabonensis, Candidatus Flaviluna,
Granulicatella elegans). Interestingly, through network analysis we were able to retrieve four
communities, also known as Species Interacting Groups (SIGs) (Figure 1D), which represent a
topological clusterization of bacterial species linked to “functional modules”, for example a disease
status. In order to see if SIGs would be related to COVID-19, nodes were colored according to the
cohort in which species had the highest mean relative abundance (after normalization and
standardization) (Figure 1D). Two SIGs (SIG1, SIG4) harbored the majority of COVID-19-related
species (18/22, 82%), while SIG2 and SIG3 contained mostly controls species (19/20, 95%), and
this repartition of species was significant (Fisher test with Freeman-Halton extension, P=2.13*10-6).
SIG1 harbored three out of six COVID-19-related species extrapolated from VIP plot (namely,
Veillonella infantium, Prevotella salivae, Prevotella jejuni), while Soonwooa purpurea was
included in SIG4, along with other two species known for their noxious effects (Atopobium
parvulum and Fusobacterium nucleatum). The first species depicted by VIP plot as discriminant for
COVID-19, namely Haemophilus parainfluenzae, was indeed colored as control within the network
because of the normalization/standardization procedure, thus meaning that this species would be not
reliable as a descriptor. The good community SIG3, harboring three discriminant species for
controls (Neisseria perflava, Rothia mucilaginosa and Granulicatella elegans), and eight of the
overall 23 control-related species, it’s the furthest from the bad SIG1, probably collecting different
genetic and metabolic pathway features with a potential to counteract COVID-19-related species.
Among the 122 species retrieved from DADA2 pipeline (Table S1), 102 were shared among the
two cohorts, while twelve and eight were present only in controls and COVID-19 samples,
respectively (Figure 1E). Venn diagram relies on the presence of species, not their relative
abundance or prevalence, thus, in order to select bacterial species having a plausible and reliable
role as biomarkers for COVID-19 and controls, we employed a combination of Volcano plot
(Figure 1F), species pairwise comparison ( Figure S2, Figure S3), VIP plot and network analysis,
resulting in 11 selected species. Bacterial species biomarkers for COVID-19 are Prevotella salivae,
Veillonella infantium, Prevotella jejuni and Soonwooa purpurea (this latter being present in
COVID-19 patients only, Figure 1E). Biomarkers species for healthy oral microbiota are Neisseria
perflava, Kallipyga gabonensis, Granulicatella elegans, Porphyromonas pasteri, Gemella
taiwanensis, Rothia mucilaginosa, Streptococcus oralis.

selected 11 species (four for COVID-19 - red, and seven for controls - green) depicts significant differences in terms of
relative abundance and prevalence. In each sub-graph are reported the P value (from Mann-Whitney U test) and the fold
ratio (FR) among COVID-19 and controls.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines are distinctive for COVID-19 in both oral and serum samples
After defining oral bacterial species as biomarkers of COVID19, we investigated their possible
correlation with proinflammatory cytokines eventually involved in a local “cytokine storm”, as
found within patients’ bloodstream recently described in literature. Using a panel of 27 cytokines
including chemokines and growth factors, we found that COVID-19 patients were significantly
distinguishable from controls using non-supervised methods such as Principal Coordinate Analysis
(PCoA, P=9.9*10-4, Figure 2A) and Hierarchical Classification Analysis (HCA, P=0.0046, Figure
2B). Aiming at finding discriminant oral cytokines for COVID-19 status, we employed volcano plot
(Figure 2C), VIP plot (Figure 2D), finding out seven COVID-19-related discriminant cytokines (IL6, IL-5, GCSF, IL-2, TNF-α, GMCSF, INF-γ) while only one (IL-12p70) for controls. IL-6 and IL12p70 were the most discriminant cytokines for COVID-19 and controls, respectively, as confirmed
by their pairwise analysis (Figure 2E). Results from serum cytokines profiling from patients with
severe symptomatology and complication, highlighted a superimposable cytokine profile to the oral
one of patients at the onset of infection (Table 2), resulting in a significant Pearson positive
correlation (Figure 2F). In particular, high levels of oral cytokines involved in early antiviral
response mirrored cytokine levels in systemic circulation. As reported in literature for the lung, the
expression of human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in mucosal oral samples were downregulated in infected
patients (greater than 100 fold) compared with no infected subjects, and no significant association
was found with microbiome composition or cytokines profile (data not shown).

showing significant positive correlation among the two cytokine patterns. Outlier cytokines having extreme values (IL1Ra, IL-15, PDGF-bb) were excluded from linear correlation analysis.

Oral bacterial species topologically counteracts COVID-19-related cytokines
Once found that specific oral cytokines were distinctive for COVID-19, and that the oral cytokine
profile was similar to the systemic circulation one, we made a cross-correlation and a network
analysis aimed at finding functional clustering and relations among bacterial species and cytokines.
Within the network, two distinct communities were formed, separated by a “structural gap” (bunch
of negative Pearson correlations) (Figure 3A): the upper community (“GREEN”) harboring 86%
species or cytokines from controls, and the lower one (“RED”) hosting 85% species or cytokines
having higher abundance in COVID-19 patients (χ2= 20.5, P<0.00001). Interestingly, keystone

species in the GREEN community were Rothia mucilaginosa and Streptococcus oralis, already
evidenced within the good community SIG3 (Figure 1D), while two cytokines (GMCSF and IL-4)
were keystone within the RED community. Moreover, within RED cluster we observed a subcluster of COVID-19-related species (Veillonella infantium, Prevotella jejuni, Streptococcus
cristatus) already seen within the bad community SIG1 (Figure 1D) that were at the farthest
distance from GREEN, thus highlighting their functional negative effect. In this proposition, given
that unifying oral cytokine and species datasets crunched the overall network structure passing from
four to two communities, and that a marked “structural gap” was evidenced among GREEN and
RED communities (Figure 3A), the next step was to study all the possible correlations among the
single species and the single cytokines, with the intention to highlight oral bacterial species with a
potential to counteract COVID-19-related cytokines. A Hierarchical Clusterization Analysys (HCA)
correlogram based on Pearson correlation coefficients was performed, resulting in three different
clusters of species based on their positive or negative correlation with cytokines (Figure 3B).
Cluster1 harbored bad species (such as Veillonella infantium, Streptococcus cristatus, Prevotella
denticola, Atopobium parvulum) already seen within COVID-19-related communities as SIG1,
SIG4 (Figure 1D) and RED (Figure 3A). Cluster2 and Cluster3 contained mostly beneficial species
that, conversely, were present within SIG2, SIG3 (Figure 1D) and GREEN (Figure 3A). With this
notion in mind, and starting from Pearson coefficients ( r ) of the two cytokines distinctive for
COVID-19 (IL-6) and controls (IL-12p70) (Figure 2D), we computed a parameter called C4
(COVID-19 Cytokines Counteracting Coefficient) valuable for each oral bacterial species (Figure
3B):
C4 = rIL-12p70 - rIL-6
Averaging all C4 values within each cluster of the HCA correlogram, resulted in C4 cluster1 = -0.017,
C4cluster2 = 0.472, C4cluster3 = 0.301, with a significant difference among Cluster1 and Cluster2 (t = 2.72764, P=0.0084, Figure 3B). Noteworthy, the species having the highest C4 values were
Streptococcus oralis, Porphyromonas pasteri and Rothia mucilaginosa, species previously found in
SIG3 and GREEN communities. The detrimental species Veillonella infantium, already found in the
RED sub-cluster (Figure 3A) and within SIG1 (Figure 1D), had the highest negative C4 value, thus
representing a plausible helper species for COVID-19 onset. In order to confirm the relation among
these four species and the involved cytokines, we performed Pearson linear correlation scatterplots
(Figure 3C) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) area plots (Figure 3D). Linear scatterplots
confirmed the expected negative correlation among beneficial species and the pro-inflammatory IL6, thus meaning that higher amounts of these bacteria could lower the pro-inflammatory oral
environment. KDE plots measured patients’ distribution along the abundance of the four selected
species or the two cytokines, evidencing how Rothia mucilaginosa and Porphyromonas pasteri,
having a clear superimposition of two peaks centered on the same value for COVID-19 (red) and
controls (green), would act differently from Streptococcus oralis, which presents two green peaks
mutually excludable from the single red one (Figure 3D). The information provided by KDE plots
would thus be compulsory for a plausible fine-tuning regulation of species relative abundances in
the oral cavity against COVID-19 onset. Taking into consideration the results from Figure 1 and
Figure 3, we selected three species as potential counteractors of COVID-19, namely Streptococcus
oralis, Rothia mucilaginosa and Porphyromonas pasteri. These species topologically grouped
within SIG3, together with other possible candidates considerable as “helpers” to their positive
function: Granulicatella adiacens, Granulicatella elegans, Gemella taiwanensis, Neisseria

Figure 3 (previous page). Integration of oral species and cytokines datasets. Network analysis (panel A) shows
communities (namely GREEN for controls and RED for COVID-19) of bacterial species and cytokines and their
positive (red Pearson coefficient) or negative (blue Pearson coefficient) abundances (relative percentage or pg/mL,
respectively for species and cytokines) correlation. Nodes are colored according to the cohort harboring the higher
abundance for a definite species or cytokine, and node name size is directly proportional to the “keystonness”
(importance of a species or cytokine within the overall network). Edge thickness is inversely proportional to the Pearson
P value after 10% Benjamini-Hochberg two-stages FDR, and it is colored according to positive (red) or negative (blue)
Pearson coefficient. For each community are reported percentages of COVID-19- and controls-related nodes. Dashed
line represents a “structural gap” (a bunch of negative Pearson correlation edges) between GREEN and RED
communities. Correlogram (panel B) of bacterial species and cytokines shows positive (red) or negative (blue) Pearson
correlation on normalized and standardized abundances. Significant correlation is marked with an asterisk inside each
square: only species or cytokines having at least one significant correlation were reported. Dendrograms on the x and y
axis were generated following Bray-Curtis similarity, evidencing three different clusters for bacterial species (shown
here within white boxes). Cytokines chosen to compute the C4 parameter (IL-12p70, IL-6) are highlighted with a
colored box in the top dendrogram. The parameter C4 computed for each species is depicted as barplot length at the
right of the correlogram, highlighting the bad species (in red) or the good ones (in green). Scatterplots (panel C) among
the four selected species and the two cytokines used to compute the C4 parameter: their abundances are negatively
related to one another (normalized and standardized data), as reported by Pearson coefficient and P value (95%
confidence interval, gray area). Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots (panel D) report on x axis the normalized and
standardized abundance of the selected species and cytokines and on y axis the subjects’ distribution, divided by
COVID-19 (red) and controls (green).

Consortia of bacteria and cytokines predict COVID-19 status and its neurological symptoms
After selecting eleven bacterial species (Figure 1) and eight cytokines (Figure 2) as biomarkers for
COVID-19 and controls, along with their topological relationships (Figure 3), we focused our
attention to their predictive power. Employing the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) metric
to evaluate classifier output quality using a 5-fold cross-validation, we evidenced how single
cytokines gave a higher power when unified to single species in predicting COVID-19 status
(Figure 4A, Figure 4B), showing a significant higher averaged Area Under Curve (AUC)
(AVGAUCavg(Cytokines_Species) = 0.891; AVGAUCavg(Species) = 0.637; Mann-Whitney U test, two-tailed
P=0.012). Moreover, the first five ROC curves in Figure 2B, representing the ROCs having the best
AUC values, were devoted to only cytokines, thus confirming their importance in defining the
disease status better than species. Aiming at finding the best consortium of bacterial species (n=11)
or species and cytokines (n=19) able to predict the COVID-19 status, a combinatorial calculation
was performed (supplementary Excel File). A total of 2047 and 524287 combinations were
retrieved for species (Figure 2C) and species plus cytokines (Figure 2D), respectively, and also in
this scenario the best averaged AUC value was significantly higher (Mann-Whitney U test, twotailed P=0.012) for “consortia'' of species plus cytokines (AVGAUCavg(Cytokines_Species) = 0.995), other
than considering proper consortia formed by species alone (AVGAUCavg(Cytokines_Species) = 0.932).
Interestingly, majority of consortia showing ROC curves with the highest values of AUC,
specificity and sensitivity (namely 0.995, 0.990 and 1.000, Figure 4D), were those encompassing a
balanced ratio of species and cytokines that were beneficial (Prevotella salivae, Streptococcus
oralis, Rothia mucilaginosa, Gemella taiwanensis, Kallipyga gabonensis, Granulicatella elegans,
IL-12p70) or detrimental (Prevotella jejuni, Soonwooa purpurea, Veillonella infantium, TNF-α,
INF-γ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-5, GCSF, GMCSF). After assessing that definite combinations of our selected

bacterial species, alone or added to oral cytokines, were able to discriminate COVID-19 status, we
aimed at parametrizing each single subject for a general COVID-19 susceptibility. To this aim, we
created two parameters, named BacCOV and CytoCOV, based on the abundances of selected
bacterial species or cytokines (shown in Figure 1G, Figure 2D). More precisely, in order to have a
bidimensional representation for both cohorts, usable to visually predict the propensity of a putative
unknown subject to COVID-19, we computed for each subject: i) the BacCOV_GREEN and
CytoCOV_GREEN averaging the abundances of beneficial species (n=7) or species plus cytokines
(n=7+1); ii) the BacCOV_RED and CytoCOV_RED value averaging the abundances of detrimental
species (n=4) or species plus cytokines (n=4+7) (Table S2, Table S3). These four values were used
to generate L-shaped graphs, in which we set x-axis and y-axis thresholds (computed as in Table
S4) in order to ease a clinical usage for subjects’ COVID-19 susceptibility (Figure 4E, Figure 4F).
Even if BacCOV significantly divided the two cohorts (P = 2.1*10-3), a one-order higher significant
separation was obtained with CytoCOV (P = 4*10-4), correctly classifying 71% of COVID-19
patients (Figure 4F). Thus, the CytoCOV parameter would be easily employed in clinics to assess
COVID-19 susceptibility for an unknown subject, through the following passages: i) assaying the
abundances of 11 bacterial species and 8 cytokines; ii) computing the CytoCOV parameter (Table
S3); iii) using the boundaries provided in Table 3.
Table 3. Boundaries for CytoCOV parameter, as evidenced in Figure 4F, in order to assess subjects’ COVID-19
predicted susceptibility. Percentage values represent subjects’ fraction.

Thirty-five percent of our COVID-19 patients (9/26) presented, as comorbidity, a neurological
involvement like ageusia or hyposmia. Applying the same analysis used previously, even if these
patients did not possess a distinctive oral microbiota composition (data not shown), significant
higher levels of detrimental species such as Prevotella jejuni and Streptococcus cristatus were
found (Figure 5A). Interestingly, these species were found within the RED community in the
combined species/cytokines network (Figure 3A). Averaged Area Under Curve (AUC) values of
ROC curves regarding these two selected species were 0.864 and 0.775, respectively (Figure 5B),
while their combination ensured an accurate prediction of 67% of patients with neurological
symptoms (confusion matrix, Figure 5C). Interestingly, these two species were positively and
significantly related (r = 0.35, P=0.027, Figure 5D), so we employed a bidimensional representation
of their relative abundances in order to assess patients’ neurological symptoms susceptibility
(Figure 5E). An unknown COVID-19 patient would thus be susceptible of neurological symptoms
if harboring Prevotella jejuni and Streptococcus cristatus at relative abundances higher than or
equal to 17.1% or 14.4%, respectively (thresholds computed as in Table S5, Fisher Exact test P =
1.9*10-3).

Figure 4. Consortia of bacteria and cytokines predict COVID-19 status. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
with 5-fold cross validation and C-Support Vector Machine classifier was employed to assess the best oral bacterial
species (among 11 selected, panel A) or species plus cytokines (among 19 selected, panel B) able to predict COVID-19
status. Each panel reports the best five Area Under Curve (AUC) values in descending order (see the inset legend also
showing specificity, Sp, and sensitivity, Se, for each ROC curve ), plus a sixth curve encompassing the preceding five
grouped. Combinations were computed for selected species (n=11, 2047 combinations, panel C) and species plus
cytokines (n=19, 524287 combinations, panel D), and the best “consortia'' predicting COVID-19 are shown along with
their AUC, Sp and Se values. BacCOV (panel E) and CytoCOV (panel F) parameters were computed and divided into
their GREEN (species and cytokines higher in controls) and RED (species and cytokines higher in COVID-19)
components, and employed to generate scatterplot 2D graphs. Abundance thresholds (computed as in Table S4) are

having neurological symptoms (panel A) are made of VIP plot, volcano plot, and boxplot of relative abundances for
selected species. Description for these plots as in Figure 1 and Figure 2 captions. Receiver Operating Characteristic
(ROC) with 5-fold cross validation and C-Support Vector Machine classifier (panel B) was built for each one of the
selected species plus their combined effect on predicting the presence of neurological symptoms (“yes”, blue) in respect
to their absence (“no”, orange). Panel B reports Area Under Curve (AUC), specificity (Sp), and sensitivity (Se) values
for each ROC curve. Confusion matrix (panel C) was employed to evaluate the quality of the output of the C-Support
Vector Machine classifier used to generate ROC curves. The diagonal elements represent the percentage of patients
(referred to the blue shadowed sidebar) for which the predicted label (x axis) is equal to the true label (y axis), while
off-diagonal elements are those that are mislabeled by the classifier. Scatterplot (panel D) among the two selected
species shows how their relative abundances are positively related to one another (normalized and standardized data),
as reported by Pearson coefficient and P value (95% confidence interval, gray area). Raw relative abundances of
selected species were used to generate a scatterplot (panel E) to ease a clinical interpretation of patients’ distribution
into the 2D space. Abundance thresholds (computed as in Table S5) are shown as truncated dotted grey lines, and their
values reported in bold: percentages of patients separated by these boundaries are reported in bold.

DISCUSSION
COVID-19 proved to be an important threat to our lives, harnessing more than 60M cases
worldwide and around 1.5M global deaths, as for November 2020 29. The major issue when coping
with the COVID-19 etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus, resides in its high spreading
ability, which is mediated by several interpersonal factors, such as oral droplets 30,31. In this
proposition, the oral cavity should be considered a preferential route for SARS-CoV-2 entry or
transmission 32,30, especially in nosocomial environments at risk 33, with potential involvement for
extrapulmonary sites (such as the brain 5 and gastrointestinal tract) 32,34. Here we investigated the
oral microbiota composition and cytokines in COVID-19 subjects and matched controls. As for
November 2020, only three experimental studies focused on the COVID-19-related intestinal
bacterial microbiota 35,36, and on fungal one 37, leaving unanswered questions on the oral district.
The new approach of social network analysis allowed us to properly merge species and cytokines
datasets, providing definite bacterial consortia as biomarkers for COVID-19 status or its related
neurological symptoms, and providing also new parameters for theranostics purposes against
COVID-19. Our results especially suggest how a minimal consortium of beneficial species
(Prevotella salivae, Streptococcus oralis, Rothia mucilaginosa, Gemella taiwanensis, Kallipyga
gabonensis, Granulicatella elegans) could be used orally as local probiotics to counteract COVID19 symptoms and cytokine storm, which is typical in COVID-19 patients 38,4. In a recent study
genera Rothia, Streptococcus and Veillonella were positively related to COVID-19 in feces 35, while
here we found how some oral species belonging to these genera exert a counteracting effect on
COVID-19 cytokine storm 4. This discrepancy is noteworthy, because future studies dealing with
different body districts should consider shotgun sequencing or 16S targeted sequencing to reach the
species level, assuring a proper functional description (e.g., combination of microbiota and cytokine
data) for clinical use. Being attractive for the ease of sampling, as demonstrated in international
projects such as HMP , the oral swab sampling (touching tongue, palatum and cheeks) would be a
valid alternative to the currently used specimens (e.g. feces, blood) to assess the microbiota
compositional differences in a disease, giving reliable insights on a subject susceptibility. Even if
with intrinsic limitations due to the number of subjects involved, and the missing point of a shotgun
implementation to ascertain gene and/or pathways differences among controls and COVID-19, our
study would give a hint to the significance of the oral microbiota restoration during pandemic as a
public health intervention 31,39–42.
