Abstract
Face masks have globally been accepted to be an effective protective tool to prevent
bacterial and viral transmission, especially against indoor aerosol transmission.
However, commercial face masks contain filters that are made of materials that are not
capable of inactivating neither SARS-CoV-2 nor multidrug-resistant bacteria. Therefore,
symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals can infect other people even if they wear
them because some viable viral or bacterial loads can escape from the masks.
Furthermore, viral or bacterial contact transmission can occur after touching the mask,
which constitutes an increasing source of contaminated biological waste. Additionally,
bacterial pathogens contribute to the SARS-CoV-2 mediated pneumonia disease complex
and their resistance to antibiotics in pneumonia treatment is increasing at an alarming
rate. In this regard, herein, we report the development of a novel protective non-woven
face mask filter fabricated with a biofunctional coating of benzalkonium chloride that is
capable of inactivating SARS-CoV-2 in one minute of contact, and the life-threatening
methicillin-resistant

Staphylococcus

aureus

and

Staphylococcus

epidermidis.

Nonetheless, despite the results obtained, further studies are needed to ensure the safety
and correct use of this technology for the mass production and commercialization of this
broad-spectrum antimicrobial face mask filter. Our novel protective non-woven face
mask filter would be useful for many health care workers and researchers working in this
urgent and challenging field.

1. Introduction
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first
reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 20191. The rapid spread of this
pathogen, which has caused the current COVID-19 pandemic, is putting at high risk the
health

and

economy

of

the

most

developed

and

underdeveloped countries. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the
current COVID-19 outbreak has 59,342,857 global cases and 1,399,373 global deaths in
more than 200 countries (data of 24th November 2020)2. SARS-CoV-2 is the third
coronavirus causing severe pneumonia3,4, an infection of the lungs caused usually by
bacteria and viruses5,6. The death risk of viral pneumonias can increase when co-infection
can be caused by viruses in the setting of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia such
as the lethal Streptococcus pneumoniae7–10, with additional symptoms of bacterial
pneumonia11. New pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, that can coexist with a broad range
of other types of clinically relevant bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains,
constitutes a real life-threatening to humans during the approaching cold season. In
addition, antibiotic resistance in bacterial pneumonia treatment is a wide-spread problem
that is increasing at an alarming rate12,13. The SARS-CoV-2 pathogen is stable from hours
to days in aerosols and surfaces of different chemical nature such as copper, cardboard,
plastic, aluminium, or stainless steel surfaces, demonstrating that infections can be easily
transmitted through the air via the microdroplets or direct contact after touching
contaminated surfaces14–18. This coronavirus can spread faster than its two ancestors
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV19 through coughing, sneezing, touching or breathing 20, and
more broadly through asymptomatic carriers21–23. Recent studies have demonstrated that
direct indoor aerosol transmission or via ventilation systems can be potentially transmit
SARS-CoV-224–26. Although the confinements conducted in many countries flattened the
epidemic curve before the hot season27,28, SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally.
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus29 that belongs to
the IV Baltimore group30. Other enveloped RNA viruses such as influenza A (H1N1) can
be inactivated by quaternary ammonium compounds such as benzalkonium chloride
(BAK)31. It has been recently remarked, however, that further evaluation of the
effectiveness of BAK against coronaviruses is needed32 because the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention have reported that available evidence indicates BAK has less
reliable

activity

against

certain

bacteria

and

viruses

than

either

of

the

alcohols33. However, a recent report has shown the in vitro virucidal activity of ethanol

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.24.396028; this version posted November 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this

(70%), povidone-iodine (7.5%), chloroxylenol (0.05%), chlorhexidine (0.05%), or
benzalkonium chloride (0.1%) was similar when used as disinfectants against SARSCoV-218. Thus, the oral rinse Dequonal, which contains BAK, has shown virucidal
activity against SARS-CoV-2 under conditions mimicking nasopharyngeal secretions to
support the idea that oral rinsing might reduce the viral load of saliva and could thus lower
the transmission of SARS-CoV-234. Furthermore, very recently, a preprint has reported
an oil-in-water nanoemulsion formulation containing 0.13% BAK that has demonstrated
safe and broad antiviral activity against enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, human
coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza B35. In that study, the repeated
application of this BAK-containing nanoemulsion, twice daily for 2 weeks on to rabbit
nostrils indicated safety with no irritation. In fact, this chemical compound is widely used
as a disinfectant against bacteria, viruses, pathogenic fungi and mycobacteria and it has
been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a skin disinfectant36. In this study,
we hypothesise here that the physical adsorption of BAK by the dip coating method37
onto the surface of a commercial non-woven fabric filter, which are commonly used in
the production of face masks in the present pandemic, could produce antiviral filters that
can inhibit the infection capacity of SARS-CoV-2. Non-woven filters are lightweight,
flexible, resilient, provides good bacteria filtration and air permeability, and are costeffective materials for masks, has a lower manufacturing cost, are hygienic and clean as
they are for single use38. Face masks have been accepted as effective protective tools by
blocking the pass of viral and bacterial particles39. However, if the filters that contain the
face masks are made by composite materials with antimicrobial activity, the protection of
these tools could increase even more. Furthermore, due to the previously reported
antibacterial activity of BAK against Gram-positive bacteria40, we also expect that the
developed BAK filter will be able to inhibit the bacterial grow of two clinically relevant
multidrug resistant bacteria: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and
Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). In addition to the current COVID-19 pandemic,
antibiotic resistance is another increasing challenge of the present century. According to
the World Health Organization (WHO), antibiotic resistance will be one of the leading
causes of death over other important diseases such as cancer by the year 205041. In fact,
MRSE is a nosocomial pathogen that is spreading globally and is often cause of catheterassociated disease, especially among low birth weight prematures42,43. MRSA is causing
global health problems specially in medical instruments and catheters because S. aureus
is a human pathogen that can easily develop resistance to antibiotics44,45. Finally, in this

study, we attempted to develop a protective face mask filter capable of inactivating
SARS-CoV-2, and MRSA and MRSE.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Dip coating of commercial face filter masks
Disks specimens of approximately 10 mm in diameter were prepared with a non-woven
spunlace fabric filter from NV EVOLUTIA (commercial filters used for face masks) by
dry cutting with a cylindrical punch. Face mask filter (BAK Filter) disks (n=6) were
produced by the dip coating method37 using commercial 70% ethyl alcohol with 0.1%
w/w benzalkonium chloride from Montplet (Barcelona, Spain) for 1 minute at 25ºC to
achieve a dry BAK content, determined gravimetrically, of 0.46±0.13% w/w. Another
face mask filter (S Filter) disks (n=6) were subjected to the same dip coating treatment
but using only an absolute ethanol/distilled water solution (70/30% v/v) without BAK for
1 minute at 25ºC. Untreated face mask filter (U Filter) disks (n=6) were produced as
reference material. The disks were subsequently dried at 60ºC for 48 hours to constant
weight and sterilized by UV radiation for one hour per each side.

2.2. Characterization of the benzalkonium chloride
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was applied for the characterization of the
benzalkonium chloride used in the biofunctional coating of the commercial nonwoven
filters. Prior to NMR sample preparation, the ethanol/water solvent was evaporated from
commercial Montplet 70% ethyl alcohol with benzalkonium chloride (99.9/0.1% w/w) at
25°C. After that, the sample of benzalkonium chloride was prepared by dissolving 10 mg
in 550 µL D2O (D, 99.9 %) (Sigma-Aldrich, Norway) and transferred to 5mm LabScape
Stream NMR tube. The NMR experiments were recorded on a BRUKER AVIIIHD 800
MHz (Bruker BioSpin AG, Fälladen, Switzerland) equipped with 5mm with cryogenic
CP-TCI. All NMR recording was performed at 25°C or 37°C. For the characterization of
benzalkonium chloride the following spectra were recorded: 1D proton, 2D double
quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy (DQF-COSY) and 2D 13C heteronuclear single
quantum coherence (HSQC) with multiplicity editing. TMS was used as chemical shift
reference for proton and carbon chemical shifts. The spectra were recorded, processed
and analysed using TopSpin 3.7 software (Bruker BioSpin).

2.3. Electron microscopy

A Zeiss Ultra 55 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Zeiss Ultra 55
Model) was operated at an accelerating voltage of 3 kV to observe the porous morphology
of the treated and untreated non-woven face mask filters at a magnification of x100 and
x1000. The filter samples were prepared to be conductive by platinum coating with
a sputter coating unit.

2.4. Phage phi6 host culture
Pseudomonas syringae (DSM 21482) from the Leibniz Institute DSMZ-German
collection of microorganisms and cell cultures GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany), was
cultured in solid Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA, Liofilchem) and subsequently in Liquid Tryptic
Soy Broth (TSB, Liofilchem). Liquid incubation was carried out at 25ºC and 120rpm.

2.5. Phage phi 6 propagation
Phage phi 6 (DSM 21518) propagation was carried out according to the specifications
provided by the Leibniz Institute DSMZ-German collection of microorganisms and cell
cultures GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany).

2.6. Antiviral test using the biosafe viral model
A volume of 50 μL of a phage suspension in TSB was added to each filter at a titer of
about 1x106 plaque‐forming units per mL (PFU/mL) and allowed to incubate for 1, 10
and 30 minutes. Each filter was placed in a falcon tube with 10mL TSB and sonicated for
5 minutes at 24 ° C. After that, each tube was vortexed for 1 minute. Serial dilutions of
each falcon sample were made for phage titration and 100 μL of each phage dilution were
contacted with 100 μL of the host strain at OD600 nm = 0.5. The infective capacity of the
phage was measured based on the double-layer method46 where 4 mL of top agar (TSB +
0.75% bacteriological agar, Scharlau) 5 mM CaCl2 was added to the phage-bacteria
mixture which was poured on TSA plates. The plates were incubated for 24-48 hours in
an oven at 25ºC. The phage titer of each type of sample was calculated in PFU/mL and
compared with the control, that is, 50 μL of phage added to the bacteria without being in
contact with any filter and without being sonicated. The antiviral activity in log reductions
of titers was estimated at 1, 10 and 30 minutes of contact with the virus model. It was
checked that the residual amounts of disinfectants in the titrated samples did not interfere
with the titration process and the sonication-vortex treatment did not affect to the

infectious capacity of the phage. The antiviral tests were performed three times during
two different days (n=6) to ensure reproducibility.

2.7. Antiviral tests using SARS-CoV-2
The SARS-CoV-2 strain used in this study (SARS-CoV-2/Hu/DP/Kng/19-027) was
kindly gifted from Dr. Tomohiko Takasaki and Dr. Jun-Ichi Sakuragi at the Kanagawa
Prefectural Institute of Public Health. The virus was plaque-purified and propagated in
Vero cells. SARS-CoV-2 was stored at -80°C.
A volume of 50 μL of a virus suspension in PBS was added to each filter at a titer dose
of 1.3x105 TCID50/filter, and then incubated for 1 minute at room temperature. 1 ml PBS
was added to each filter, and then vortexed for 5 minutes. After that, each tube was
vortexed for 5 minutes at room temperature.
Viral titers were determined through median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)
assays inside a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory at Kyoto University. Briefly,
TMPRSS2/Vero cells47 (JCRB1818, JCRB Cell Bank), cultured with the Minimum
Essential Media (MEM, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, were seeded into 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Samples were serially diluted 10-fold from 10−1 to 10−8 in the culture medium.
Dilutions were placed onto the TMPRSS2/Vero cells in triplicate and incubated at 37°C
for 96 hours. Cytopathic effect was evaluated under a microscope. TCID50/mL was
calculated using the Reed-Muench method.

3.3. Antiviral tests using the biosafe SARS-CoV-2 viral model
Phage phi 6 is a double-stranded RNA virus with three-part, segmented, totalling
~13.5 kb in length. Even though this type of lytic bacteriophage belongs to the Group III
of the Baltimore classification30, it was proposed here as a viral model of SARS-CoV-2,
due to biosafety reasons, as it has also a lipid membrane around their nucleocapsid. Thus,
BAK Filters showed potent antiviral activity (100% of viral inhibition, see Figures 3 and
4). Bacterial lawns had clearly grown in the plate and no plaques were observed after 1,

10 or 30 minutes of contact between the BAK filter and the SARS-CoV-2 viral model.
Furthermore, the U Filters and S Filters showed similar results to control of no antiviral
activity (see Figures 3 and 4).

Figure 4 shows that the titers obtained by contacting the phages with the U or S Filters
are similar to the control. However, the BAK Filters displayed a strong phage
inactivation.

The results achieved with the TCID50/mL method about the reduction of infectious titers
of SARS-CoV-2 after 1 minute of contact with the control, the U Filters, the S Filters and
the BAK Filters containing the biofunctional coating are shown in Figure 5.

These results clearly demonstrate that the BAK Filter is very effective against SARSCoV-2 even after 1 minute of contact. This is also in good agreement with the antiviral
results of the biosafe viral model used in this study (see Figures 3 and 4).

3.5. Antibacterial tests
The antibacterial results of the treated filters against MRSA and MRSE multidrugresistant bacteria are shown in Figure 6.

normalized widths of the antibacterial “halos”, expressed as mean±standard deviation and
calculated with equation (1), are shown in each image.

Filters treated by dip coating with 70% Ethyl alcohol containing 0.1% benzalkonium
chloride showed high antibacterial activity against MRSA and MRSE, being even more
effective against the last strain. The antimicrobial mode of action of quaternary
ammonium compounds (QACs) such as BAK against both bacterial and viral
phospholipid membranes are attributed to the positively charged nitrogen atoms. This
cause eradication of surface bacteria and common viruses such as influenza by disrupting
their phospholipid bilayer membrane32, the glycoproteinaceous envelope, and the
associated spike glycoproteins interacting with the ACE2 receptor in the infection of host
cells52. For this reason, BAK is extensively found in many household disinfecting wipes
and sprays, and are also used as additives in various soaps and nonalcohol-based hand
sanitizers31,53,54.
Here in this paper it is demonstrated a new face mask filter with antiviral and antibacterial
properties against Gram-positive multidrug-resistant bacteria to reduce COVID-19
infections (from touching the filter masks and aerosol transmission in both senses). This
face mask filter has been developed here by dip coating (a simple, low-cost, reliable and

reproducible method) a commercial nonwoven filter where a thin coating of BAK were
deposited onto the surface by physically adsorption55. The same biofunctional coating
procedure could be applied to any type of face mask or biodegradable filters. This also
represents a solution to the need for bio-based facemasks to counter coronavirus
outbreaks38. The manufacturing procedure by dip coating with BAK opens up a broad
range of applications that are demanding urgently new antimicrobial approaches. Thus,
this technology may be also used for the fabrication of antimicrobial clothes, gloves, etc,
for health personnel or to produce antimicrobial filters able to inactivate aerosols
containing SARS-CoV-2 or Gram-positive multidrug-resistant bacteria in other
applications. The antibacterial activity of these filters against MRSA and MRSE, and their
viral inhibition capacity against SARS-CoV-2 and the enveloped phage phi 6 viral model
demonstrates their broad-antipathogenic protection. Nonetheless, further research is
required in order to ensure the safety use of the developed filters to combat the increasing
COVID-19 spread.

4. Conclusions
Non-woven benzalkonium chloride-containing filters capable of inactivating SARSCoV-2 and multidrug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, were developed here. This antimicrobial filter
produced by a reproducible and economic procedure demonstrated excellent antiviral
properties (100% viral inactivation already after 1 minute of contact) against the SARSCoV-2 and the phage phi 6 phage viral model, which is an RNA enveloped virus like the
SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the developed antiviral filters can be used in face masks and
thus are very promising to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the present COVID-19
pandemic.
