ABSTRACT

26

IGHV3-53-encoded neutralizing antibodies are commonly elicited during SARS-CoV-2

27

infection and target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. Such

28

IGHV3-53 antibodies generally have a short CDR H3 due to structural constraints in

29

binding the RBD (mode A). However, a small subset of IGHV3-53 antibodies to the RBD

30

contain a longer CDR H3. Crystal structures of two IGHV3-53 neutralizing antibodies here

31

demonstrate that a longer CDR H3 can be accommodated in a different binding mode

32

(mode B). These two classes of IGHV3-53 antibodies both target the ACE2 receptor

33

binding site, but with very different angles of approach and molecular interactions. Overall,

34

these findings emphasize the versatility of IGHV3-53 in this common antibody response

35

to SARS-CoV-2, where conserved IGHV3-53 germline-encoded features can be

36

combined with very different CDR H3 lengths and light chains for SARS-CoV-2 RBD

37

recognition and virus neutralization.

INTRODUCTION

39

Development of an effective vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome

40

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is perhaps the most exigent health-related priority due to the

41

ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, the molecular and functional understanding of

42

the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination is still somewhat limited,

43

but is critical for vaccine assessment and redesign. Most SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that

44

target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the spike (S) protein appear to be

45

neutralizing (Brouwer et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020; Rogers et al.,

46

2020; Zost et al., 2020) and the most intuitive mechanism of neutralization is that they

47

block binding of the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

48
49

To date, several structures of antibodies that target the ACE2-binding site on RBD have

50

been determined (Cao et al., 2020; Ju et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020), including some that

51

are encoded by the IGHV3-53 gene (Barnes et al., 2020; Brouwer et al., 2020; Wu et al.,

52

2020; Yuan et al., 2020a). Our previous study demonstrated that antibodies encoded by

53

the IGHV3-53 gene utilize germline-encoded residues to engage the ACE2-binding site

54

on the RBD, accounting for their frequency in shared antibody responses in SARS-CoV-

55

2 patients (Yuan et al., 2020a). Due to structural constraints in their mode of binding

56

through interaction with the germline-encoded heavy chain complementarity determining

57

regions (CDR) H1 and H2, a short CDR H3 (length of ≤10 amino acids, Kabat numbering)

58

is also a molecular signature of these IGHV3-53 antibodies (Barnes et al., 2020; Yuan et

59

al., 2020a). Nevertheless, a small subset (around 10%) of RBD-targeting IGHV3-53

60

antibodies have much longer CDR H3s (15 amino acids or longer) (Barnes et al., 2020;

61

Yuan et al., 2020a). As it was not apparent how such IGHV3-53 antibodies could retain

62

the same binding mode and fit their longer CDR H3 into a highly restricted pocket in the

63

RBD (Yuan et al., 2020a), we aimed to resolve this conundrum.

RESULTS

66

Two RBD-targeting IGHV3-53 antibodies with different binding modes

67

We determined crystal structures of two IGHV3-53 neutralizing antibodies, COVA2-04 and

68

COVA2-39 (Brouwer et al., 2020), with different CDR H3 lengths in complex with SARS-

69

CoV-2 RBD to 2.35 and 1.72 Å resolutions, respectively (Figure 1A and Table S1). Both

70

antibodies were derived from a convalescent donor from Amsterdam and potently

71

neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virus (Brouwer et al., 2020). Similar to typical RBD-targeting

72

IGHV3-53 antibodies (Barnes et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020a), COVA2-

73

04 has a relatively short CDR H3 of 10 amino acids, whereas COVA2-39 CDR H3 is 15

74

amino acids (Kabat numbering, Figure S1A). COVA2-04 has only two somatic amino-acid

75

substitutions in the heavy chain and one in the light chain, which is encoded by IGKV3-20

76

(Figure S1B). COVA2-39 has three somatic mutations in the heavy chain and one in the

77

light chain, which is encoded by IGLV2-23 (Figure S1C).

78
79

COVA2-04 and COVA2-39 both bind to the ACE2-binding site on RBD, which is consistent

80

with previous competition assays (Brouwer et al., 2020). Nonetheless, their angles of

81

approach and binding modes are very different (Figure 1A-C). COVA2-04 mainly uses the

82

light chain to interact with the flat surface of the ACE2-binding site and the heavy chain

83

with the RBD ridge, whereas COVA2-39 mainly uses the heavy chain to interact with the

84

flat surface and both heavy and light chains with the ridge (Figure 1B, Figure 2A-B and

85

Table S2). In addition, COVA2-04 binds to the side of the ridge, whereas COVA2-39 binds

86

at its tip (Figure 1B). The binding mode of COVA2-04 is very similar to previously

87

characterized IGHV3-53 antibodies with a short CDR H3, including CC12.1, CC12.3, B38,

88

and C105 (Barnes et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020a) (binding mode A,

89

Figure 1C). In contrast, binding mode (mode B) of COVA2-39 is quite different and its Fab

90

is rotated 180° along its long axis relative to COVA2-04, thereby swapping the relative

91

orientation of the light and heavy chains, resulting in completely different molecular

92

interactions.

93
94

Both binding modes are dominated by heavy chain

95

Structural modeling shows that both COVA2-04 and COVA2-39 can only bind to the RBD

96

when it is in the “up” conformation on the trimeric S protein (Figure S2) (Walls et al., 2020;

97

Wrapp et al., 2020). This finding is consistent with previous low-resolution, negative-stain

98

electron microscopy analysis, which also indicated that these antibodies have different

99

angles of approach (Brouwer et al., 2020). Despite these differences, interactions of

100

COVA2-04 and COVA2-39 with the RBD are both dominated by the heavy chain. For

101

COVA2-04, the buried surface areas (BSA) of the heavy and light chains are 798 Å2 and

102

360 Å2, respectively, compared to 576 Å2 and 128 Å2 for COVA2-39. However, this BSA

103

difference does not translate into a corresponding difference in Fab binding affinity.

104

Specifically, the dissociation constants (Kd) for COVA2-04 and COVA2-39 to insect cell-

105

expressed RBD are 40 nM and 21 nM, respectively (Figure 1D). COVA2-04 exhibits slow-

106

on/slow-off kinetics, whereas COVA2-39 has fast-on/fast-off kinetics. Despite the faster

107

off-rate, similar Kd and lower BSA, COVA2-39 IgG is more potent than COVA2-04 in

108

neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 (IC50s of 0.036 and 0.22 µg/ml, respectively, in a pseudovirus

109

assay, and 0.054 and 2.5 µg/ml in an authentic virus assay (Brouwer et al., 2020)).

110
111

Compared to COVA2-04, the COVA2-39 epitope has less overlap with the ACE2-binding

112

site. Among 17 ACE2-binding residues on the RBD (Lan et al., 2020), 16 are within the

113

epitope of COVA2-04 and 11 within the epitope of COVA2-39 (Figure 2A-C). The

114

difference in angles of approach and apparent avidity of the IgG interaction in the context

115

of the spike trimer appear to allow COVA2-39 attain higher neutralization potency, similar

116

to avidity effects for IgG of some antibodies to influenza hemagglutinin RBD (Ekiert et al.,

117

2012; Lee et al., 2014). Indeed, the Kd of IgG to mammalian cell-expressed SARS-CoV-2

118

spike protein is 2.3 nM for COVA2-04 and 0.1 nM for COVA2-39 (Brouwer et al., 2020),

119

which represents a 20-fold difference in apparent IgG binding avidity that may also result

120

from the higher local Fab concentration and rebinding of IgG to the spike protein on both

121

the sensor in the binding experiment and on viral surface.

122
123

Both binding modes involve similar motifs

124

Previously, we have described the germline-encoded features of IGHV3-53, including an

125

32NY33

126

the ACE2-binding site of SARS-CoV-2 RBD in binding mode A (Yuan et al., 2020a). These

127

motifs are also important for COVA2-04 engagement of the RBD in a similar manner to

128

other IGHV3-53 antibodies in binding mode A (Figure 3A-B) (Yuan et al., 2020a).

129

Interestingly, some of these germline-encoded residues are also involved in binding of

130

COVA2-39 (mode B), but to a different location and, hence, to different residues on the

131

RBD. VH Y33 of the 32NY33 motif is retained and forms a π−π stacking interaction between

132

its aromatic ring with the aromatic side chain of Y489 (Figure 3C). Although VH N32 in

133

COVA2-39 does not interact with the RBD, both its side chain and main chain participate

134

in a 310 turn to stabilize the CDR H1 backbone (Figure 3C), similar to that observed with

135

COVA2-04 and other IGHV3-53 antibodies (Figure 3A) (Yuan et al., 2020a). The 53SGGS56

136

is somatically mutated to

137

conservative substitution. Similar to the

138

of VH T53 and VH T56 (water-mediated H-bond), as well as the backbone amides of VH

in COVA2-39, which would appear to be a

142

T53, VH G55, and VH T56 (Figure 3D). The side chains of VH T53 and VH T56 also

143

participate in additional water-mediated H-bonds with backbone carbonyls and amides of

144

the RBD. Nevertheless, despite the similarity between Ser and Thr in size and ability to

145

form similar H-bonds with their side-chain hydroxyl, reverting the

146

COVA2-39 to the germline-encoded

147

RBD by at least 50-fold (Figure 1D and Figure S4A). The increased binding for 53TGGT56

148

is likely due to the methyl groups in VH T53 and T56, which make additional van der Waals

149

interactions (Figure S4B).

150
151

Similar to the 53SGGS56 motif, 53TGGT56 in COVA2-39 takes part in a type I beta turn along

152

with VH Y52, which is the first residue (i) in the turn (YTGG). The partial positive dipole

153

from the aligned amides at the amino-end of the turn forms a charged interaction with the

154

RBD E484 carboxyl group. Moreover, VH Y52 is an important residue for binding SARS-

155

CoV-2 RBD in binding mode B, but not in binding mode A (Figure 3E). VH Y52 of COVA2-

156

39 forms a π−π interaction with backbone peptide bond between RBD G485 and F486.

157

COVA2-39 also employs other IGHV3-53 germline-encoded residues for interaction with

158

the RBD, including VH S30, VH Y58, VH N73, and VH S74 (Figure S4C-D). Overall, these

159

findings demonstrate that the germline-encoded features of IGHV3-53 are conducive for

160

interaction with different regions of the ACE2-binding site on the RBD that involve different

161

approach angles (i.e. binding modes A and B) in the context of different CDR H3 lengths.

162
163

Binding mode B has less structural constraints on CDR H3 length

164

Next we aimed to understand the relationship between CDR H3 length and the two

165

different binding modes. Consistent with previous structures of IGHV3-53 antibodies that

166

target the RBD in binding mode A (Barnes et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020a),

167

CDR H3 of COVA2-04 is highly buried by the RBD and the light chain (Figure 4A). This

168

observation substantiates the notion that IGHV3-53 in binding mode A has strong

169

structural constraints on CDR H3 length. In contrast, in binding mode B, the longer CDR

170

H3 of COVA2-39 is largely solvent exposed (Figure 4B). This observation explains why

171

IGHV3-53 can accommodate a longer CDR H3 in binding mode B (COVA2-39) compared

172

to mode A (COVA2-04, CC12.1, CC12.3, B38, and C105). Interestingly, COVA2-39 CDR

173

H3 interacts with the RBD mostly through non-specific van der Waals interactions. Three

174

H-bonds are also made, two of which (one water-mediated) involve the CDR H3

175

backbone, whereas only one involves a side chain (VH E100c) (Figure 4C). Thus,

176

interaction between CDR H3 of COVA2-39 and RBD is largely sequence non-specific and

177

simply accommodates its longer length. The CDR H3 sequences of IGHV3-53 antibodies

178

in binding mode A (COVA2-04, CC12.1, CC12.3, and B38) are also quite different (Wu et

179

al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020a) (Figure 4D). As a result, while both binding modes A and B

180

do not have strong constraints on the actual CDR H3 sequences, structural constraints on

181

CDR H3 length is much stronger in binding mode A compared to mode B.

182
183

Light chain of IGHV3-53 antibody is associated with CDR H3 length

184

An important feature in COVA2-39 interaction with the RBD is its engagement of the

185

ACE2-binding ridge. Specifically, RBD F486 at the tip of the ridge is anchored in a pocket

186

formed by both heavy and light chains (Figure 5A). RBD F486 forms a π−π stacking

187

interaction with VL Y91, which in turn is stabilized by a network of T-shaped π−π stacking

188

interactions involving VH W47, VH F100g, VL Y30, and VL W96 (Figure 5B, Figure S5). This

189

critical interaction with the ridge indicates that the light-chain identity is important for

190

binding mode B. In fact, the CDR H3 lengths of RBD-targeting IGHV3-53 antibodies seem

191

to depend on the light chain identity. For example, all known RBD-targeting IGHV3-53

192

antibodies that pair with IGKV1-9 (n = 20) and IGKV3-20 (n = 15) have a relatively short

193

CDR H3 (7 to 11 amino acids) (Figure 5C) (Brouwer et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Ju et
8

194

al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). In contrast, all three

195

known RBD-targeting IGHV3-53 antibodies that pair with IGLV2-23, including COVA2-39,

196

have a CDR H3 of 14 amino acids or longer (Figure 5C). Therefore, despite the limited

197

sample size, there seems to be a relationship between the light chain identity of RBD-

198

targeting IGHV3-53 antibodies and CDR H3 length. This observation further supports a

199

role for light-chain identity, together with CDR H3 length, in determining the particular

200

binding mode of IGHV3-53 antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

201
202

DISCUSSION

203

The additional binding mode identified here demonstrates that IGHV3-53 is even more

204

versatile than previously thought in SARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeting antibodies (Yuan et al.,

205

2020a). However, a remaining question is why binding mode A is more commonly seen

206

given the structural constraints for below average CDR H3 length, even for VH3-53

207

antibodies in general (Barnes et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020a). In mode

208

A, the germline sequences of CDR H1 and H2, along with a conserved residue in FR3,

209

seems to be the major determinant of binding without much involvement of specific

210

residues of CDR H3. In binding mode B, formation of the RBD ridge-anchoring pocket

211

involves both CDR H3 and L3 loops. In COVA2-39, the RBD ridge-anchoring pocket is

212

formed from VH F100g in CDR H3 and VL W96 in CDR L3 and generated during V(D)J

213

recombination. Thus, the probability of satisfying the molecular requirements to create the

214

RBD ridge-anchoring pocket (binding mode B) could be less than simply using the

215

unmutated germline sequence with no particular CDR H3 sequence requirements other

216

than length (binding mode A). Nonetheless, additional structures of RBD-targeting IGHV3-

217

53 antibodies with longer CDR H3s should further aid in explaining the differential

218

occurrence frequency between binding modes A and B.

220

Given the large number of neutralizing antibodies currently being identified (Andreano et

221

al., 2020; Brouwer et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Chi et al., 2020; Ju et al., 2020; Kreer et

al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Seydoux et al., 2020; Zost et al.,

223

2020), structural understanding of the antigenicity and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 S

224

protein is still at an early stage. It is clear that antibodies are elicited to the RBD in natural

225

infection. As SARS-CoV-2 may eventually become endemic within the human population

226

(Li et al., 2020) and escape mutations may arise, the structural information elucidated here

227

can be harnessed for modifying or improving existing vaccine designs, and for assessing

228

the quality and efficacy of vaccine responses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

323

Expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 RBD

324

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) (residues 319-541) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)

325

protein (GenBank: QHD43416.1) was cloned into a customized pFastBac vector (Ekiert

326

et al., 2011), and fused with an N-terminal gp67 signal peptide and C-terminal His6 tag

327

(Yuan et al., 2020b). A recombinant bacmid DNA was generated using the Bac-to-Bac

328

system (Life Technologies). Baculovirus was generated by transfecting purified bacmid

329

DNA into Sf9 cells using FuGENE HD (Promega), and subsequently used to infect

330

suspension cultures of High Five cells (Life Technologies) at an MOI of 5 to 10. Infected

331

High Five cells were incubated at 28 °C with shaking at 110 r.p.m. for 72 h for protein

332

expression. The supernatant was then concentrated using a 10 kDa MW cutoff

333

Centramate cassette (Pall Corporation). The RBD protein was purified by Ni-NTA,

334

followed by size exclusion chromatography, and buffer exchanged into 20 mM Tris-HCl

335

pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl.

336
337

Expression and purification of Fabs

338

For COVA2-04 and COVA2-39, the heavy and light chains were cloned into phCMV3. The

339

plasmids were transiently co-transfected into ExpiCHO cells at a ratio of 2:1 (HC:LC) using

340

ExpiFectamine™

341

manufacturer’s instructions. The supernatant was collected at 10 days post-transfection.

342

The Fabs were purified with a CaptureSelect™ CH1-XL Affinity Matrix (Thermo Fisher

343

Scientific) followed by size exclusion chromatography.

was adjusted to 12 mg/ml and screened for crystallization using the 384 conditions of the

349

JCSG Core Suite (Qiagen) on our custom-designed robotic CrystalMation system

350

(Rigaku) at Scripps Research. Crystallization trials were set-up by the vapor diffusion

351

method in sitting drops containing 0.1 μl of protein and 0.1 μl of reservoir solution.

352

Diffraction-quality crystals were obtained in the following conditions:

353
354

COVA2-04/RBD complex (12 mg/mL): 8.5% isopropanol, 10% ethylene glycol, 15%

355

glycerol, 0.085 M HEPES pH 7.5, and 17% polyethylene glycol 4000 at 20 °C.

356

COVA2-39/RBD complex (12 mg/mL): 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.6, 20% isopropanol, 10%

357

ethylene glycol, and 20% polyethylene glycol 4000 at 20 °C.

358
359

All crystals appeared on day 3, harvested on day 7, and were then flash cooled and stored

360

in liquid nitrogen until data collection. Diffraction data were collected at cryogenic

361

temperature (100 K) at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) on the new

362

Scripps/Stanford beamline 12-1 with a beam wavelength of 0.97946 Å, and processed

363

with HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Structures were solved by molecular

364

replacement using PHASER (McCoy et al., 2007). The models for molecular replacement

365

of RBD and COVA2-04 were from PBD 6XC4 (Yuan et al., 2020a), whereas the model of

366

COVA2-39

368

carried out in COOT (Emsley et al., 2010) and PHENIX (Adams et al., 2010), respectively.

369

Epitope and paratope residues, as well as their interactions, were identified by accessing

370

PISA (Proteins, Interfaces, Structures and Assemblies) at the European Bioinformatics

Institute (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/prot_int/pistart.html) (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007).

Antibody binding and competition assays were performed by biolayer interferometry (BLI)

375

using an Octet Red instrument (FortéBio) as described previously (Wu et al., 2017), with

376

anti-human Fab-CH1 2nd generation (FAB2G) biosensors. There were five steps in the

377

assay: 1) baseline: 60 s with 1x kinetics buffer; 2) loading: 240 s with 50 μg/mL of COVA2-

378

04 Fab or COVA2-39 Fab; 3) baseline: 60 s with 1x kinetics buffer; 4) association: 180 s

379

with serial diluted concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RBD; and 5) dissociation: 180 s with 1x

380

kinetics buffer. For Kd estimation, a 1:1 binding model was used.

34

were measured by biolayer interferometry (BLI). Y-axis represents the response and blue

35

lines represent the response curves. A 1:1 binding model did not fit very well, potentially

36

due to some contribution of non-specific binding to the response curve. Subsequently, a

2:1 heterogeneous ligand model was used to improve the fit, which is represented by the

red lines. In both models, the Kd estimated is > 1 μM. Binding kinetics were measured for
