Abstract

22

The main protease, Mpro, of SARS-CoV-2 is required to cleave the viral polyprotein into

23

precise functional units for virus replication and pathogenesis. Here we demonstrate a

24

quantitative reporter for Mpro function in living cells, in which protease inhibition by

25

genetic or chemical methods results in strong eGFP fluorescence. This robust gain-of-

26

function system readily distinguishes between inhibitor potencies and can be scaled-up to

27

high-throughput platforms for drug testing.

Main text

29

Viral proteases are proven targets for highly effective antiviral therapies (reviewed by

30

refs.1-3). SARS-CoV-2 has two proteases, Papain-Like protease (PLPro, Nsp3) and Main protease

31

/3C-Like protease (Mpro, 3CLpro, Nsp5), which are responsible for 3 and 11 viral polyprotein

32

cleavage events, respectively (reviewed by refs.4-7). These cleavage events are essential for virus

33

replication and pathogenesis and, therefore, these proteases are under intensive investigation for

34

the development of drugs to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Many biochemical

35

assays are available for measuring SARS-CoV-2 protease activity (e.g.,8-10) but specific and

36

sensitive cellular assays are less developed (compared in Discussion). Here we demonstrate a

37

gain-of-function assay for quantifying genetic or chemical inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro

38

activity in living cells.

39

During attempts to create a chromosomal reporter for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity,

40

analogous to HIV-1 single cycle assays, we constructed an apparently non-functional chimeric

41

protein consisting of an N-terminal myristoylation domain from Src kinase, the full Mpro amino

42

acid sequence with cognate N- and C-terminal self-cleavage sites, the HIV-1 transactivator of

43

transcription (Tat), and eGFP (Fig. 1a). Transfection into 293T cells failed to yield green

44

fluorescence by flow cytometry or microscopy (Fig. 1a-b). However, an otherwise identical

45

construct with a catalytic site mutation in Mpro (C145A) resulted in high levels of fluorescence,

46

suggesting auto-proteolytic activity is required for the apparent lack of expression of the

47

wildtype construct. This possibility was further supported by fluorescence of a cleavage site

48

double mutant construct (CSM), in which the conserved glutamines required for Mpro auto-

49

proteolysis were changed to alanine (corresponding to Nsp4-Q500A and Mpro/Nsp5-Q306A).

50

This double mutant showed less fluorescence than the MPro catalytic mutant, potentially due to

2

51

recognition of alternative cleavage sites. These interpretations were underscored by immunoblots

52

showing no visible expression of the wildtype construct and strong expression of the full

53

chimeric Mpro catalytic mutant protein (Fig. 1c). Although the CSM yielded fluorescence, the

54

full-length chimeric protein was barely detectable by anti-eGFP immunoblotting (Fig. 1a-c and

55

additional blots not shown).

56

Multiple small molecule inhibitors of Mpro have been described, including GC376 and

57

boceprevir (reviewed by ref.11). GC376 was developed against a panel of 3C and 3C-like

58

cysteine proteases including feline coronavirus Mpro (refs.12, 13), and boceprevir was developed as

59

an inhibitor of the NS3 protease of hepatitis C virus1, 14, 15. These small molecules have also been

60

co-crystalized with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and the binding sites well-defined8, 16. We therefore next

61

asked whether a high dosage of these compounds could mimic the genetic mutants described

62

above and restore fluorescence activity of the wildtype construct. Interestingly, 50 µM GC376

63

caused a strong restoration of expression and fluorescence of the wildtype construct (Fig. 2a). In

64

comparison, 50 µM boceprevir caused a weaker but still significant effect. The potency of

65

GC376 was confirmed in dose response experiments with both fluorescent microscopy and

66

immunoblotting as experimental readouts (Fig. 2b-c). Interestingly, at high concentrations of

67

GC376 (100 µM) the subcellular localization of the wildtype chimeric protein phenocopied the

68

C145A catalytic mutant with predominantly cytoplasmic membrane localization due to the N-

69

terminal myristoyl anchor (Fig. 2d). However, at lower concentrations (1 µM), eGFP signal was

70

mainly nuclear consistent with partial Mpro activity and import of the Tat-eGFP portion of the

71

chimera into the nuclear compartment through the NLS of Tat17 (Fig. 2d). These subcellular

72

localization data are reflected by immunoblots in which a Tat-eGFP band predominates at low

73

drug concentrations and full-length Src-Mpro-Tat-eGFP at high concentrations (Fig. 2b).

Discussion

76

The Src-Mpro-Tat-eGFP system described here provides a quantitative – “Off-to-On” –

77

fluorescent read-out of genetic and pharmacologic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 MPro activity. The

78

system is modular and likely to be equally effective with sequences derived from other N-

79

myristoylated proteins such as the ARF GTPases and HIV-1 Gag, closely related coronavirus

80

proteases such as MERS and SARS MPro, more distantly related viral proteases such as HCV

81

NS3/4a and picornavirus 3C, and the full color spectrum of fluorescent proteins. The system is

82

also cell-autonomous as similar results were obtained using both 293T and HeLa cell lines (Fig.

83

S1). A molecular explanation for the instability of the wildtype chimeric construct is still under

84

investigation but potentially due to a protease-dependent exposure of an otherwise protected

85

protein degradation motif (degron). However, regardless of the full mechanism, the gain-of-

86

function system described here for protease inhibitor characterization and development in living

87

cells is likely to have immediate and broad utility in academic and pharmaceutical research.

88

Existing assays for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro activity in living cells are non-specific and/or less

89

sensitive. One assay is a simple measure of cell death with Mpro overexpression resulting in

90

toxicity (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.29.272864). The application of this assay for high

91

throughput screening is limited due to incomplete cell death (resulting in low signal/noise) and

92

issues dissociating Mpro inhibition from small molecule modulators of cell death pathways

93

including apoptosis. A different assay uses Mpro activity to “flip-on” GFP fluorescence18

94

(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.359042v1). Although this assay provides

95

some specificity for Mpro catalytic activity, it shows a narrow dynamic range for GC376 making

96

it poorly equipped for high-throughput screening and identifying additional inhibitors. We

97

independently developed a near-identical system and observed substantial levels of background

98

in the absence of Mpro (Fig. S2). However, signal to noise issues aside, the most important

99

distinction between any live cell Mpro inhibitor assay described to date and the system described

100

here is the readout for chemical inhibition, the former measuring signal diminution (which

101

quickly runs into background) and the latter providing a gain-of-function fluorescent signal far

102

above negligible background levels. By reading-out an increase in eGFP signal that directly

103

reflects the potency of Mpro inhibition, our system provides stringent specificity for small

104

molecules that target Mpro catalytic activity. Moreover, our assay helps to identify compounds

105

that are cell permeable and non-toxic, as less permeable and toxic compounds are predicted to

106

yield less fluorescent signal and effectively drop from consideration. We are hopeful this assay

107

will contribute to the development of potent drugs to combat the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic

108

as well as future coronavirus zoonoses.

Methods

111

Plasmid construction – Nsp5, Tat, and eGFP coding sequences were amplified from existing

112

vectors and fused using overlap extension PCR. The final reaction added the 5’-myristolation

113

sequence from Src22 and HindIII and NotI sites for restriction and ligation into similarly cut

114

pcDNA5/TO (Thermo Fisher Scientific #V103320). Wildtype and catalytic mutant Nsp5 were

115

amplified from pLVX-EF1alpha-nCoV2019-nsp5-2xStrep-IRES-Puro19 and HIV-1 Tat from a

116

HIV-1 molecular clone20. The eGFP coding sequence was amplified from pcDNA5/TO-A3B-

117

eGFP21. Sanger sequencing confirmed the integrity of all constructs. Primer sequences are

available on request.
