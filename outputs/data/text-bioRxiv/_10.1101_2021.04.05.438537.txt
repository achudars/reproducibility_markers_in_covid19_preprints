Abstract
The world is experiencing an unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein-based vaccines are currently the main preventive agent to fight against the virus. However,
several variants with extensive mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins have emerged. Some of these
variants exhibited increased replication, higher transmission and virulence, and were partially resistant
to antibody neutralization from natural infection or vaccination. With over 130 million confirmed cases
and widespread vaccination around the globe, the emergence of new escape SARS-CoV-2 variants could
be accelerated. New therapeutics insensitive to mutations are thus urgently needed. Here we have
developed an inhibitor based on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that potently reduced pseudovirus
infectivity by limiting the level of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins on virion envelope. Most importantly,
the inhibitor was equally effective against other coronavirus spike proteins that shared as low as 35%
amino-acid sequence identity, underscoring its extreme tolerance to mutations. The small-sized
inhibitor would also allow simple delivery by, for instance, nasal spray. We expect the inhibitor
reported here to be an invaluable aid to help end COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the use of a partial
native sequence or its homologues to interfere with the functions of the native protein represents a novel
concept for targeting other viral proteins in combating against important viral pathogens.

Main text
In the past 20 years, there have been three major threats from coronavirus, the 2002-2003
outbreak in China from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the 2012-2014
outbreak in Middle East from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)1,2, and the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Currently, the world is racing to contain

SARS-CoV-2 mainly by using SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS2-S)-based vaccines. However,
continued genomic evolution has led to SARS-CoV-2 variants with extensive mutations on SARS2-S
proteins3-5 (Fig.1a). These mutations endorsed tighter binding with host cell surface receptor, human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), higher virulence, resistance to antibody neutralization and
escape from natural infection or vaccine induced sera6-10. Therefore, there is an urgent need for other
interventions that are insensitive to genomic mutations.
Towards this end, we have developed a polypeptide-based inhibitor, F1, that potently interfered
with the formation and translocation of coronavirus spike glycoproteins to host cell surface and to the
envelope of generated pseudoviruses. Although derived from the SARS2-S sequence, F1 was also
effective on 2002 SARS-CoV spike protein (SARS-S) and 2012 MERS-CoV spike protein (MERS-S).
These sequences shared as low as 35% amino-acid sequence identity, stressing the extreme resistance of
F1 to mutations in spike sequences of emerging COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 variants. Different from
traditional protein-based therapeutics, the F1 polypeptide-based interference requires that the plasmid or
minicircle DNA harboring F1-coding gene is delivered into the host to synthesize F1 polypeptide at the
site where the target spike proteins are synthesized. Therefore, the rapid degradation intrinsically
associated with protein/polypeptide-based therapeutics is no longer a problem. Moreover, the smallsized F1-minicircle developed here would also allow simple delivery by, for example, nasal spray. We
expect the inhibitor reported here to be an invaluable aid to our effort to stop COVID-19 pandemic.

The concept of polypeptide-based protein interference
Viral membrane fusion proteins such as coronavirus spike proteins are oligomeric Class-I
transmembrane glycoproteins on the viral envelope11. Coronavirus spike proteins are cleaved to give
rise to N-terminal S1 regions and C-terminal S2 regions (Fig.1a). The N-terminal S1 regions are the

major target for neutralizing antibodies elicited by natural infection or vaccination, and therefore under
constant positive selection for escape variants (Fig.1a). On the other hand, the C-terminal S2 regions
responsible for oligomerization and membrane fusion12-16 are more conserved among different
coronavirus strains. Upon entry into a host cell, the viral genome will guide the synthesis of new
coronavirus spike proteins by ribosomes, which are then folded, assembled and translocated into
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and transit through the ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment
for interaction with newly replicated genomic RNA to produce new virions17,18.
We hypothesized that stably foldable fragments of the coronavirus spike proteins, for instance,
polypeptides derived from the SARS2-S S2 regions, which maintained the same oligomeric interface as
the native spike proteins, would form non-native oligomers with the wild-type spike proteins, thus
significantly lowering the level of native spike oligomers on the envelope of newly generated virions,
and impairing their infectivity (Fig.1b). More importantly, the fragment derived from the conserved S2
region would be more resistant to mutations and could be potentially “universal” against different
coronaviruses. To test this strategy, we made two polypeptides derived from the SARS2-S sequence, F1
and F2, that contained partial SARS2-S S2 sequence (Fig.1a, Fig.S1, S2). F1 polypeptide encompassed
amino-acid residues 911~1273, while F2 harbored residues 985~1273. Both polypeptides contained a
N-terminal signal peptide (SP) as the wild-type SARS2-S for cell surface translocation.
F1 polypeptide potently inhibited expression and cell surface translocation of multiple coronavirus
spike glycoproteins
We first assessed the impacts of F1 or F2 on the expression and cell surface translocation of
SARS2-S protein. Transient transfection of SARS2-S-harboring plasmid yielded a good level of
proteins detected in HEK293T whole cell lysate, with most of the expressed proteins were cleaved

(Fig.2a). This high-efficiency cleavage of SARS2-S proteins agreed with the novel polybasic cleavage
site at the S1/S2 boundary12,13,19,20. Moreover, only the S2 fragments of the cleaved SARS2-S protein
were labeled by biotin, affinity-purified by anti-biotin antibody and detected in cell surface fraction
(Fig.2a), suggesting that only properly cleaved SARS2-S protein were translocated to cell surface.
Most impressively, when F1-harboring plasmid was co-transfected with SARS2-S-carrying plasmid,
even at a twofold molar ratio, the predominant cleaved S2 band of SARS2-S was almost completely
diminished in whole cell lysate and in cell surface fraction (Fig.2a). Thus, F1 strongly interfered with
the expression and cell surface translocation of SARS2-S. In sharp contrast, F2 did not exhibit any
significant interference even at a tenfold molar ratio (Fig.2a).
Sequence comparison of 2002 SARS-S, 2012 MERS-S and COVID-19 SARS2-S suggested a
wide range of sequence identity levels among them (Fig.S2, S3). For instance, 2002 SARS-S shared
77% amino-acid sequence identity with full-length COVID-19 SARS2-S, while 2012 MERS-S was only
at 35% (Fig.S2, S3). If only considering the regions included in F1 polypeptide, the identical residues
became 94% for 2002 SARS-S and 42% for 2012 MERS-S (Fig.S2, S3). These spike proteins with a
wide range of sequence identity levels were ideal for testing the insensitivity of F1-induced interference
to amino-acid changes. Strikingly, even with F1-harboring plasmid at a twofold molar ratio, the cleaved
SARS-S and MERS-S S2 bands were almost completely diminished in whole cell lysate and in cell
surface fraction (Fig.2b,c). Thus, despite the low sequence identity, F1 also strongly interfered with the
expression and cell surface translocation of SARS-S and MERS-S glycoproteins. Consistent with the
robust interference activity exhibited by F1 (Fig.2), a high level of F1 polypeptide was constantly
detected in cell surface fraction (Fig.S4a-c). In marked contrast, a limited level of F2 polypeptide was
detected in cell surface fraction (Fig.S4a), in agreement with the non-interference of F2 (Fig.2a).
F1 interfered with coronavirus spike proteins at the protein level

In order to probe the mechanism of F1-mediated interference of coronavirus spike proteins, we
analyzed the mRNA levels of coronavirus spike proteins in the absence or presence of F1 or F2-carrying
plasmids (Fig.S5, S6). Clearly co-transfection of F1- or F2-harboring plasmids did not significantly
change the mRNA levels of coronavirus spike proteins, which were kept at a relatively constant level
(between 50%~150%) comparing to the samples that were transfected only with plasmids carrying the
respective coronavirus spike gene (Fig.S5). In sharp contrast, the mRNA levels of F1 were at the order
of 2^6.5~2^12 when normalized against endogenous GAPDH (Fig.S6), justifying the high potency of
F1-mediated interference. The mRNA levels of F2 were comparable with those of F1 (Fig.S6a), in
marked contrast with the low level of F2 polypeptide detected in cell surface fraction (Fig.S4a),
suggested that the non-interference of F2 (Fig.2a) was likely due to the instability of the synthesized F2
polypeptide. Collectively, these data suggested that F1-mediated interference of various coronavirus
spike glycoproteins was not at the mRNA level.
We next investigated whether SARS2-S and F1 directly interacted with each other to form nonnative oligomers in the cell. SARS2-S and F1 were each tagged with a monomeric green fluorescent
protein (GFP) variant at the extreme C-terminus, CFP for SARS2-S (termed as SARS2C) and YFP for
F1 (named as F1Y) (Fig.S5d). Since the expression of SARS2-S was completely diminished when F1and SARS2-S-carrying plasmids were co-transfected at a 2:1 molar ratio (Fig.2a), we used F1Y- and
SARS2C-containing plasmids at a reduced 1:1 molar ratio to transiently transfect HEK293T cells, and
monitored fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between them. The FRET ratio (FR) was
determined by using the three-cube approach21. Although the non-native oligomers formed by
SRARS2C and F1Y were expected to be highly unstable, FRET signals between them were robustly
detected (Fig.S5e), supporting direct interactions between SARS2-S and F1. Collectively, these results

suggested that F1-mediated interference of various coronavirus spike glycoproteins was at the protein
level.
F1 minicircle potently interfered with expression and cell surface translocation of all three
coronavirus spike glycoproteins
The high potency of F1 in interfering with expression and surface translocation of the spike
glycoproteins from coronaviruses that caused severe outbreaks or pandemic between 2002 to 2021
suggests that F1 has a high promise to become an effective therapeutic agent against different
coronavirus lineages over a long time period. Therefore, we sought to identify a convenient way to
deliver F1 for therapeutic purpose. The potent interference activity of F1 requires it to co-localize with
its target spike protein at the time of protein synthesis, therefore F1-encoding gene needs to be delivered
to the site of action. Minicircles are a type of newly developed DNA carriers for gene therapy22. The
main features of minicircles include the cleaner gene background with minimal viral or bacterial gene
elements, sustained high-level protein expression, and more importantly, the small size that may allow
the use of aerosols for drug delivery23. The latter may be a distinct advantage against coronaviruscaused respiratory diseases.
We made a F1 minicircle by inserting the F1 coding sequence into the parental minicircle
cloning vector pMC.CMV-MCS-SV40polyA (Fig.3a), and tested its efficacy in interfering with
expression and surface translocation of coronavirus spike glycoproteins. Compared to the controls
where no minicircle was used, the presence of F1 minicircles, at a merely 4.5-fold molar ratio, almost
completely abolished cell surface translocation of all three spike proteins (Fig.3b-d). It is important to
emphasis that this level of potent interference was achieved under the situation where pcDNA3.1-based
plasmids harboring coronavirus spike-coding genes were efficiently replicated in HEK293T cells, while

F1 minicircle cannot. Therefore, F1 minicircle demonstrated strong interference with the expression and
cell surface translocation of these coronavirus spike proteins.
F1 minicircle reduced the level of SARS2-S protein on intact pseudoviruses and impaired
pseudovirus infectivity
To investigate the consequences of the reduced cell surface translocation of coronavirus spike
proteins by F1 minicircle, we compared the level of SARS2-S protein on pseudoviruses generated using
luciferase-expressing, env-defective HIV-1 genome plasmid pRL4.3-Luc-R-E- in the presence of
different molar ratios of control minicircle made from the empty parental vector (termed as MN501A) or
F1 minicircle. In order to make sure that only spike proteins anchored on the pseudovirus envelope
were accounted for, we employed QuickTiter Lentivirus Titer kit to precipitate intact pseudoviruses
from cleared supernatant prior to analysis by western blot. Impressively, even with a twofold molar
ratio of F1 minicircle, almost no SARS2-S was detected on the generated intact pseudoviruses (Fig.4a).
Not surprisingly, these pseudoviruses completely failed to infect hACE2-expressing HEK293T cells
(Fig.4b).
Discussion
In the current research, we present a series of compelling evidence that the F1 polypeptide
derived from COVID-19 SARS2-S potently reduced the expression and surface translocation of the
spike proteins from all three coronaviruses that caused regional outbreaks or global pandemic in the last
20 years, despite as low as 35% amino-acid sequence identity among them. Although extensive
mutations were found on SARS2-S proteins in recent SARS-CoV-2 variants3-5 (Fig.1a), the regions
corresponding to F1 polypeptide were highly conserved, as exemplified by the nearly identical sequence
of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7-S with F1 (Fig.S3b). Therefore, F1 polypeptide is expected to be effective on

the spike proteins of almost any emerging COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 variants in the future. Furthermore,
since the spike proteins of other human coronaviruses and 2012 MERS-CoV have a similar level of
sequence identity with F1 (Fig.S3b), we expect F1 to be equally effective on all these spike proteins.
Moreover, this polypeptide-based interference targeting the conserved sequences of coronavirus spike
protein to interfere with its functions represents a novel concept for therapeutics with high efficacy and
specificity, resistance to evolution and easy adaptability to other viral proteins in combating against
important viral pathogens.

bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C incubator supplied with 5% CO2.
Cell surface biotinylation and protein purification
Cell surface biotinylation and protein purification were performed using Pierce Cell surface
Protein Biotinylation and Isolation Kit following the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, cell surface
proteins on HEK293T cells were first labeled with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin at 4°C for 30 minutes, which
were then stopped by adding Tris-buffered saline and further washed. After cells were lysed with Lysis

Pseudovirus generation, precipitation and concentration
Pseudovirus generation followed the protocol reported earlier25. Essentially, HEK293T cells
were seeded on 6-well plates the night before. The next day, pcDNA3.1-SARS2-S (0.6 μg) and pRL4.3Luc-R-E- (0.6 μg) were used to transfect one-well HEK293T cells using Lipofectine 3000. MN501A
minicircle or F1 minicircle at indicated molar ratio was included in the transfection mixture. At 16
hours post-transfection, the HEK293T cells were fed with fresh medium. At 48 hours after medium
change, the supernatant of each well of the 6-well plates was harvested, and centrifuged at 300 g for 5
minutes to remove cell debris. Pseudoviruses were purified using QuickTiter Lentivirus Titer kit

Luciferase assay of cell entry by pseudoviruses
HEK293T cells were seeded on 100 mm dishes the night before. The next day, HEK293T cells
were transfected with 10 μg pcDNA3.1-hACE2 using Lipofectine 3000. At 16 hours post-transfection,
the cells were resuspended in FBS-free DMEM medium, and plated onto 96-well white plates to which
10 μL concentrated pseudoviruses was already added to each well. Two hours later, each well was
added with an equal volume of DMEM containing 20% FBS. The cells were further incubated for 36
hours, then an equal volume of One-Glo EX Luciferase Assay Reagent was added, after incubation for 3
minutes, the luminescence signals were recorded.

(438/24 excitation, 470/24 emission) and YFP (513/17 excitation, 559/38 emission). Donor and
Acceptor control channels were acquired using CFP-CFP and YFP-YFP, respectively. FRET images
were acquired using CFP-YFP excitation and emission filter pair. Cells were chosen with similar
intensity profiles in donor and acceptor prior to acquisition while under 37°C and 5% CO2
environmental conditions. Z stacks (0.25µm) covering the whole cell (~12µm) were acquired before
applying a conservative restorative algorithm for quantitative image deconvolution using SoftWorx v7.0,
and saving files as a max pixel intensity projection tiff for each individual channel. The FRET ratio (FR)

was determined by using the three-cube approach21 that was defined as the ratio of YFP emission in the
presence of FRET over that in the absence of FRET:

FR=FA(D)/ FA=[SFRET(DA)-RD1•SCFP(DA)]/RA1•[SYFP(DA)-RD2•SCFP(DA)]

Where RD1= SFRET(D)/SCFP(D); RD2=SYFP(D)/SCFP(D); RA1=SFRET(A)/SYFP(A); and SFRET, SCFP and SYFP
with D, A, DA in parenthesis refer to fluorescence signals of the FRET, CFP or YFP channel when only
SARS2C (containing CFP as donor (D)), F1Y (containing YFP as acceptor (A)), or both SARS2C and
F1Y-containing plasmids (both donor and acceptor (DA)) were included in the transfection. Averages
from untransfected cells were subtracted from same-day fluorescence values for each filter cube.
According to the definition, FR=1.0 means no FRET, while FR>1.0 indicates the presence of FRET
between the proteins carrying donor and acceptor proteins.

Figure 1. The concept of polypeptide-based protein interference against coronavirus spike proteins. a). Domain organization of COVID-19 SARS2-S, the
mutations in recent variants and the design of interfering polypeptides F1 and F2. SP: Signal peptide; NTD: N-terminal domain; RBD: receptor-binding domain; SD1:
subdomain 1; SD2: subdomain 2; FP: fusion peptide; HR1: heptad repeat 1; HR2: heptad repeat 2; TM: transmembrane domain; CT: Cytoplasmic tail. The cleavage at
S1/S2 (red arrow) gives rise to N-terminal S1 fragment and C-terminal S2 fragment. The signal peptide sequence at the extreme N-termini of F1 and F2 allowed the
polypeptides to be translocated in the same way as COVID-19 SARS2-S. At the extreme C-termini, SARS2-S had a C9 epitope recognized by C9-rhodopsin antibody
1D4, while both F1 and F2 had a FLAG-tag. b). Diagram of polypeptide-based interference targeting coronavirus spike proteins. Top row: in the normal situation, the
spike proteins were synthesized, folded and formed native spike oligomers, which were anchored on virion envelope. Bottom row, interfering polypeptides formed nonnative oligomers with the wild-type spike proteins, thus reducing the level of native spike oligomers on the envelope of new virions.

Figure 4. F1 minicircle significantly reduced the level of SARS2-S on intact pseudoviruses and impaired pseudovirus
infectivity. a). The level of cleaved S2 protein was compared for intact pseudovirus produced from HEK293T cells transfected
with SARS2-S-containing plasmid and different ratios of empty minicircle control, MN501A (Sample 1~4), or F1 minicircle (Sample
5~8). b). Pseudovirus generated in the presence of only twofold molar ratio of F1 minicircle completely lost the ability to infect
hACE2-expressing HEK293T cells. The infectivity of pseudovirus generated in the presence of twofold molar ratio of MN501A
minicircle was considered as 100%.
