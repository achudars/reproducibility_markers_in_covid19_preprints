Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is triggered by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, continues to threaten global public
health. Developing a vaccine that only requires single immunization but provides
long-term protection for the prevention and control of COVID-19 is important. Here,
we developed an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vaccine expressing a stable
receptor-binding domain (SRBD) protein. The vaccine requires only single shot, but
provides effective neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) over 300 days in rhesus macaques
(Macaca mulatta). In addition, the NAbs are at much higher levels than seen in the
sera of convalescent patients. It is worth to note that though we detected the
pre-existing AAV2/9 NAbs before immunization, the vaccine still induced high and
effective NAbs, and did not boost the AAV2/9 NAbs levels in rhesus macaques.
Importantly, AAV-SRBD immune sera efficiently neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 P.1/P.2,
B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 variants. Together, all the data suggest the vaccine has great
potential in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Main
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious respiratory disease and
continues to pose a serious global public health emergency. On 18 May 2021, the
World Health Organization (WHO) reported over 163 million confirmed cases and 3.3
million deaths globally. The disease shows a high infection rate, long incubation
period, and rapidly emerging variants, which have led to its rapid spread worldwide1.
Many vaccines have been developed to varying stages for the control of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for
COVID-19, including vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA)2, 3, DNA 4, viral
vectors5, 6, inactivated SARS-CoV-27, 8, 9, and recombinant proteins10. Indeed, several
vaccines have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), which have been shown to effectively protect patients from SARS-CoV-2
infection. However, these vaccines lack long-term antibody protection data, and most
require multiple injections to induce stable neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Therefore,
developing a vaccine that only requires single-dose immunization but provides
long-term protection for the prevention and control of COVID-19 would be optimal.
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a single-stranded DNA parvovirus widely used
for gene therapy 11, 12. AAV vectors have special features that are highly beneficial for
clinical applications. For instance, AAVs have low immunogenicity and rarely cause
immune inflammation; AAVs can stably express foreign genes over a long period and
are easy to produce; and AAVs belong to the safest Risk Group 1 (RG1) level of
biotechnology products and are considered safe gene delivery vectors. Several AAV
vector-mediated gene therapy products have been approved by the FDA for the
treatment of inherited blindness, spinal muscular atrophy, and Duchenne muscular
dystrophy

13

. Thus, we applied AAV vectors in the current study to develop a

long-term expression vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19. The AAV2/9 serotype
was chosen as the vaccine carrier due to its high transduction efficiency in muscles14.

angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for entry into target cells15. As
such, it is the main antigen target for vaccines. Based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein structure (PDB: 6VXX), we found that the receptor-binding domain (RBD)
was not stable. Therefore, to stabilize the antigen, we designed a stable
receptor-binding domain (SRBD) that spanned the spike protein from Q321 to S591
with a C and N tail to form a beta-sheet (Figure 1 a and b). For comparison, we
designed two other vaccines, named S12 and S2. The S12 vaccine contained the
signaling sequence (SS), N-terminal domain (NTD), RBD, and SD1, SD2, and S1/S2
subdomains of the spike protein driven by the cytomegalovirus early enhancer
chicken/β-actin (CAG) promoter. The S2 vaccine contained all amino acids in S12
plus the S2’ domain (Figure S1a). Thermal stability analysis proved that the SRBD
protein was more thermostable than RBD alone (Figure 1c).
To assess the immunogenicity of these AAV vaccines, we injected four types of
vaccines (i.e., S12, S2, RBD, and SRBD) intramuscularly into C57BL/6J mice at a
dose of 1 × 1011 virus genomes (vg)/mouse (Figure S1b). AAV-CAG-GFP (1 × 1011
vg/mouse) was used as a control. Blood samples from the C57BL/6J mice were
collected on days 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 post injection. Compared with the control,
NAbs were only detected in the AAV-CAG-SRBD mouse group (Figure 1d), thus we
chose SRBD as the antigen target for further study. In addition, SRBD was detected in
the injected left leg muscle (injected muscle, IM) but not in the right leg muscle
(opposite muscle, OM; Figure S1c). Histological analysis illustrated that no
significant pathological changes occurred in the major tissues of AAV-injected mice,
e.g., lung, heart, liver, spleen, and kidney, compared with the control group (Figure
1e). These results suggest that the SRBD vaccine exhibited good immunogenicity and
safety in mice.
For further examine vaccine safety and efficiency, we evaluated the
immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the SRBD vaccine in a nonhuman primate
(NHP) species. Specifically, 13 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were randomly
divided into three groups and received a single-dose immunization of 1 × 1012

vg/macaque (high-dose, seven macaques), 1 × 1011 vg/macaque (middle-dose, three
macaques), or 1 × 1010 vg/macaque (low-dose, three macaques) of SRBD, respectively.
AAV-CAG-GFP/macaque (1 × 1012 vg) was used as the control vaccine (three
macaques). All intramuscular-injected macaques showed normal body weight post
injection (Figure S2a). Blood samples from the macaques were collected for testing
NAbs (Figure 2a). One potential limitation of AAV vaccine application is that most
humans and macaques have experienced wild-type AAV exposure, which can result in
pre-existing AAV NAbs and inhibition of AAV transduction in primates16. Given this,
we tested the levels of AAV NAbs in the macaques before and after vaccination. First,
we randomly selected seven macaques (two macaques each in the low- and
middle-dose groups and three macaques in the high-dose group) to test their
pre-existing levels of AAV NAbs. All tested macaques were found to be NAb-positive,
suggesting that AAV2/9 NAbs may commonly pre-exist in this species (Figure 2b).
Furthermore, the AAV NAb levels did not change significantly from days 0 to 56 in
the different groups. Even in the long-term high-dose macaques, AAV NAbs remained
at a similar level from days 0 and 217. These results suggest the existence of AAV
NAbs in macaques before immunization, and that intramuscular injection of the AAV
vaccine did not boost AAV NAb levels.
Even though AAV NAbs pre-existed in the macaque blood samples, the levels of
SRBD NAbs in all macaques were determined at different days post injection (Figure
2c-e). The SRBD vaccine demonstrated good immunogenicity in the high- and
middle-dose macaques, but not in the low-dose macaques (Figure 2c, Figure S2c-d).
In addition, the seroconversion rate (antibody titer > 1000) reached 100% on day 35
after immunization in the high- (7/7) and middle-dose (3/3) macaques, but only 33.3%
on day 56 in the low-dose macaques (1/3). These results suggest that the pre-existing
AAV NAbs did not prevent the transduction of the AAV vaccine in the muscle cells
following intramuscular injection. We also monitored the NAb levels in the high-dose
macaques from days 0 to 308. Results indicated that NAbs emerged on day 21 in the
high-dose group and remained at a high level until day 308, with a much higher titer

than found in the mixed sera of convalescent patients (H-M) (Figure 2d-e)17,

18

.

Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that at day 42, the
NAbs in the high-dose macaques effectively inhibited the interaction between the
RBD and ACE2, and the efficacy was better than that in H-M sera (Figure 2f-g). The
inhibition ability of the NAbs was maintained from days 70 (Figure S2e-f) to 308 post
injection (Figure 2f-g). The pre-existing AAV NAbs and stably expressed SRBD
NAbs detected in the macaques suggest that AAV NAbs do not inhibit the immunity
of AAV-delivered vaccines. We next tested the protection ability of NAbs against real
SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV-WIV04) in Vero E6 cells using plaque reduction
neutralization test (Figure 2h-j). Notably, sera from the high-dose group at days 42
and 126 post injection effectively protected the Vero E6 cells from SARS-CoV-2
infection. In particular, the 50% plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) of
serum in the high-dose macaques on day 126 reached 10000, indicating that the
vaccine has a high protection ability (Figure 2j). The above results suggest that the
SRBD vaccine induced high and effective NAbs in rhesus macaques despite the
pre-existence of AAV NAbs in their blood before immunization.
The long-term toxicity of the SRBD vaccine was further evaluated in the rhesus
macaques. As of day 308, no deaths, impending deaths, or significant abnormalities in
clinical physiology were found in any macaque. Widely analyzed pathological
indicators also showed that lymphocyte subgroup (CD20+, CD3+, CD3+CD4+, and
CD3+CD8+) distribution was normal before and after intramuscular injection (Figure
3a-d). In addition, T helper 1 cells (Th1) labeled with IFN-γ and TNF-α and T helper
2 cells (Th2) labeled with IL-10 were unchanged before and after injection (Figures
3e, 3f, and 3i). The IFN-γ-, TNF-α-, and IL-10-positive CD8+ T cells were found at a
similar proportion before and after vaccination (Figure 3g, 3h, and 3j). Other
pathological indicators of blood, i.e., white blood cell (WBC), monocyte (MONO),
neutrophil (NEUT), eosinophil (EO), basophil (BASO), lymphocyte (LYMPH), red
blood cell (RBC), and platelet (PLT) counts, were also normal before and after
immunization with different doses of the AAV vaccine (Figure S3). These results

suggest that the vaccine did not induce T cell-specific responses after vaccination.
To evaluate the safety of the AAV SRBD vaccine, the expression of SRBD was
analyzed in the livers of the macaques (Figure S4a). The mRNA expression of SRBD
was detected in the high-dose macaques but not in middle-dose group. As it is
technically difficult to analyze the AAV-based gene expression in all major organs of
macaques, the expression of GFP was analyzed in the major organs of mice (Figure
S4b-c). Results showed that GFP signaling was found in the injected muscle cells and
liver cells of mice, but not in other major organs, i.e., heart, lung, spleen, or kidney,
even in the high-dose group. Hepatic function tests indicated that there was no liver
function damage in the macaques after AAV injection (Figure S5a-d). Thus, the AAV
vector was deemed to be safe, even at the highest dose tested (1 × 1012 vg/ macaque).
Recently, SARS-CoV-2 variants P.1/P.2, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 have spread rapidly
worldwide19, 20. Of concern, certain approved vaccines have shown lower protective
efficiency against these variants. To test the protection ability of the SRBD NAbs to
different SARS-CoV-2 variants, we generated several RBD mutant proteins (P.1/P.2
with K417T, E484K, and N501Y; B.1.1.7 with N501Y and A570D; and B.1.351 with
K417N, E484K, and N501Y). Competitive ELISA showed that the macaque serum
effectively inhibited the interactions between the RBD mutants (P.1/P.2, B.1.1.7, and
B.1.351) and ACE2 (Figure 4a-d). Therefore, the SRBD NAbs appear to offer
long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 variant RBDs (Figure 4e-j). As the N501Y
mutation is found in all three SARS-CoV-2 variants, we evaluated the interactions
between the RBD N501Y mutant and SRBD NAbs. Results indicated that the SRBD
NAbs from the middle- and high-dose macaques interacted with the RBD N501Y
mutant and inhibited interactions between the RBD N501Y mutant and ACE2 (Figure
S6). Thus, these results indicate that the SRBD vaccine has the potential to block
infection from SARS-CoV-2 variants.
In conclusion, we developed a single-dose vaccine that can provide long-term
protection against SARS-CoV-2. Our results show that SRBD is not only more

thermostable than RBD alone but can also trigger high NAb production. The vaccine
can maintain SRBD NAbs for more than 300 days, providing high levels of NAbs and
long-term protection without damaging the main tissues of the tested macaques.
Importantly, the pre-existing AAV NAbs in primates did not impact the effectiveness
of the AAV-based vaccine, on the other hand, the injection of AAV-based vaccine does
not boost AAV NAb. Therefore, it may be possible for patients to receive multiple
AAV-based vaccinations. More importantly, the SRBD vaccine provides protective
effects against emerging variants. Therefore, this vaccine highlights a new avenue for
the control of SARS-CoV-2.
Materials and Methods
Animal husbandry samples
C57BL/6 Mice and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were maintained at 25 °C on a
12 h: 12 h light:dark cycle in an animal room at the University of Science and
Technology of China. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the

(202006220919000464981). The macaques received a single-dose immunization (1
mL) of 1 × 1012 vg/macaque (high-dose), 1 × 1011 vg/macaque (middle-dose), 1 × 1010
vg/macaque (low-dose) of SRBD, and 1 × 1012 vg/macaque of AAV-CAG-GFP as
control by intramuscular injection. Mice received a single-dose immunization (20 µL)
of 1 × 1011 vg/mouse of SRBD, RBD, S1, S2 or AAV-CAG-GFP. For the
immunohistochemistry analysis, mice received different doses (1 × 1011/10/9 vg/mouse)
of AAV-CAG-GFP.
AAV-package
The AAV vaccines were packaged in HEK-293T cells. In brief, 10 μg of pHelper
vector, 5 μg of AAV2/9 vector, and 5 μg of pITR vector (S2/S12/RBD/SRBD/GFP)
were transfected into a 10-cm diameter dish with HEK-293T cells by

Polyethylenimine (PEI) (PolyScience, Niles, USA). The HEK-293T cells were
cultured with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco, 11965-092) and
10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, 16000-044) at 37 °C. The supernatant of HEK-293T
cells was harvested at days 3 and 6 after transfection. The supernatant was
concentrated with Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filters (Millipore, UFC905024) and then
gradient-purified with 15% to 60% Optiprep (Sigma, D1556). The AAV vaccine was
harvested and washed using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) six times, then diluted in
150 μL of PBS. The titers of the AAV vaccines were calculated by quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The AAV vaccines were stored at
−80 °C.
Electron microscope (EM) sample preparation
The AAV vaccines (1 × 1012 vg/mL) were added to carbon-coated copper grids
previously glow-discharged at low air pressure and stained with 2% uranyl acetate for
90 s. The EM was operated at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV. Images were
recorded using a Tecnai G2 Spirit 120kV electron microscope at 23000×
magnification.
Protein expression and purification
The methods for purifying the SARS-CoV-2 RBD [amino acid (AA) 321–591],
SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants, and human ACE2 extracellular domain (AA 19 to 615)
followed previous research 18. In brief, target genes were inserted into the pTT5 vector,
which contains a IFNA1 signal peptide at the N-terminus and a TEV enzyme site
connected to the human IgG1 Fc at the C-terminus. The expression vectors were then

supernatant. The supernatant was then loaded onto the protein A column and the target
protein was eluted with 0.1 M acetic acid on ÄKTA pure (GE Healthcare). The

collected protein was added to 1 mM Edetate disodium (EDTA), 5 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT), and TEV enzyme to remove Fc on a shaker in a 4 °C freezer. After dialysis in
1 × PBS, tandem protein A and nickel columns were used for further purification.
Both Fc and undigested protein were loaded onto the protein A column and TEV (6 ×
His tag) was loaded onto the nickel column. The target protein was collected during
flow through.
Thermal stability analysis
To compare the thermal stability of RBD and SRBD, circular dichroism (CD) spectra
were acquired on a Chirascan Spectrometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK).
Prior to CD measurements, the sample buffers were changed to PBS and the protein
concentration was adjusted to 0.5 mg/mL, as determined by its absorbance at 280 nm.
For thermal titration, CD spectra were acquired from 20 to 95 °C with temperature
steps of 5 °C and wavelengths between 180–260 nm. The CD signals at 222 nm were
used to characterize structural changes during thermal titration. The data were fitted
by Prism v6 to calculate the Tm values.
Vaccine immunogenicity analysis
The C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks old; male and female; 20–25 g body weight) were
randomly divided into five groups (5 mice per group). The mice were intramuscularly
injected with four kinds of AAV vaccines or the AAV-CAG-GFP control at a dose of 1
× 1011 vg (20 μL). The macaques were randomly divided into four groups (7
macaques in high-dose group and 3 macaques in other groups) and intramuscularly
injected with 1 mL of SRBD vaccine (1 × 1012/11/10 vg for high/middle/low dose) or
AAV-CAG-GFP control (1 × 1012 vg). Blood was collected from macaques before
immunization and every 7 days before day 42 after injection and every 14 or 21 days
after day 42.
ELISA and competitive ELISA

Nunc MaxiSorp plates were coated with 2 μg/mL (for ELISA) or 3 μg/mL (for
competitive ELISA) recombinant RBD, RBD N501Y, P.1/P.2 RBD, B.1.1.7 RBD, or
B.1.351 RBD, or 3 μg/mL AAV9 at 4 °C overnight. After washing four times with
PBS (3 min each time), the plates were blocked by 5% no-fat milk in PBS at room
temperature for 2 h. Serially diluted serum (5% no-fat milk in PBST (PBS with 0.1%
Tween-20) for ELISA or 5% no-fat milk in PBST with 15 nM biotin-ACE2-TEV-Fc
for competitive ELISA) was added to the plates, which were then incubated at room
temperature for 1 h. After washing three times with PBST (3 min each time),
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sangon Biotech,
D110087, mouse serum, ELISA), rabbit anti-monkey IgG (Cellwaylab, C020217,
macaque serum, ELISA), or HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Beyotime, A0303,
competitive ELISA) were added, followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 h.
For macaque serum ELISA, HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sangon Biotech,
D110058) was added, followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 h. After
washing three times with PBST (3 min each time), TMB substrate (Beyotime, P0209)
was added for 8 min, then stopped by 1 M H2SO4. Absorbance at 450 nm was
measured with a microplate reader.
Plaque reduction neutralization test in Vero E6 cell assay
The macaque serum samples were tested using a plaque reduction neutralization test
(PRNT) for SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV-WIV04) in the BSL-3 Laboratory. Briefly,
serum was heat inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min and diluted to 1:50, followed by
three-fold serial dilutions (1:50, 1:150, 1:450, 1:1350, 1:4050, and 1：12150).
The serum was then mixed with 100 PFU of the virus and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h.
The virus-serum dilution mixtures and virus control were then inoculated into Vero E6
cell monolayers in 24-well plates for 1 h, before adding an overlay medium including
1.5% methylcellulose at 37 °C for 4–5 days to allow plaque development. The plates
were then fixed and stained with 2% crystal violet in 30% methanol for 30 min at
room temperature, after which the plaques were manually counted and measured. The

PRNT titer was calculated based on a 50% reduction in plaque count (PRNT50).
RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from organs with Trizol (Invitrogen, 15596026) and
PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara, RR037A). Forward and reverse primers were
designed to target SRBD (Forward: 5’-AATGGCGTGGAGGGCTTTAA-3’ and
Reverse: 5’- GCAAGGTGTGATGTCCAGGA-3’).
Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining
Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg, intraperitoneal
injection), then perfused with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Organs
were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, then dehydrated in 15%
and 30% sucrose, respectively. Organs were sectioned at a thickness of 10 μm for
H&E staining with a freezing microtome. Isopropanol (500 μL) was added to the
slices and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. The slices were air dried, stained
with hematoxylin (Agilent, S330930-2, 1 mL), and incubated at room temperature for
7 min. The slices were then washed 10 times (10 s each time) with ultrapure water,
followed by the addition of bluing buffer (Agilent, CS70230-2, 1 mL) and incubation
at room temperature for 2 min. After washing five times with ultrapure water (10 s
each time), eosin mix (Sigma, HT110216, 1 mL) was added, and the sections were
incubated at room temperature for 1 min.
Immunohistochemical analysis
Organs (muscle, liver, heart, lung, spleen, and kidney) were sectioned (40-μm thick)
for immunohistochemical analysis with a freezing microtome. After washing with
PBS three times (5 min each time), the slices were blocked with 3% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The slices
were then stained using 1:1000 anti-GFP antibody (Earthox, E002030-02) in
blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Slices were washed with PBS three times (15 min

each time) and incubated with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 donkey
anti-mouse IgG (1: 1000, Thermo Scientific, A21202) for 2 h at room temperature.
DAPI (1:1000, Thermo Scientific, D3571) was used to stain cell nuclei. Confocal
images were captured using a Leica microscope.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), exocellular and intracellular
staining, and flow cytometry
Blood samples from macaques were collected in EDTA-2K tubes. Ficoll medium (3
mL, Solarbio, P4350) was first added into a 15-mL tube, followed by blood (3 mL)
and density gradient centrifugation at 400 ×g for 20 min at room temperature
(ACC/DEC: 6/2). The plasma was then collected and stored at −80 °C.
CELLSAVING buffer (Xinsaimei, C40100) was used to resuspend the PBMCs after
thorough washing with PBS, the cells then stored at −80 °C.
The frozen cells were resuspended and washed in RPMI medium 1640 (Gibco).
Anti-CD3 (BD, 557705), anti-CD4 (BioLegend, 357423), anti-CD8 (BioLegend,
301007), and anti-CD20 (BioLegend, 302310) antibodies were added to the cells for
staining for 30 min in the dark on ice. After washing with PBS (30 s), the cells were
tested on the BD FACSVerse flow cytometer. The PBMCs were also resuspended in
RPMI medium 1640, with a cocktail (BD Biosciences, 550583) added to activate the
cells at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were washed with 1 × PBS (30 s) and stained on ice in the
dark for 30 min with anti-CD3 (BD, 557705), anti-CD4 (BioLegend, 357423), and
anti-CD8 (BioLegend, 344714). The cells were then fixed and permeabilized using a
Cytofix/Cytoperm Soln Kit (BD Biosciences, 554714). Afterwards, cells were stained
with anti-IFN-γ (BioLegend, 502526), anti-TNF-α (BioLegend, 502930), and
anti-IL-10 (BioLegend, 501420) antibodies and incubated on ice in the dark for 1 h.
After washing with PBS (30 s), the cells were tested on the BD FACSVerse flow
cytometer. FlowJo v10 software was used for data analysis.

All data are presented as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM), except for the
titers of NAbs, which were quantified using geometric mean + geometric standard
deviation. Student’s t-test was used to determine the statistical significance of
differences in Figure 1c. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and two-way
ANOVA were used to determine the statistical significance of the bar and curve
graphs, respectively. Quantification graphs were analyzed using GraphPad Prism v6
(GraphPad Software). *: p<0.05; **: p<0.01; ***: p<0.001
