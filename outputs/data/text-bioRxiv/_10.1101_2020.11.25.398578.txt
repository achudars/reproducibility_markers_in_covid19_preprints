Abstract:

19

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing

20

coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite the urgent need, we still do not fully

21

understand the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and its ability to antagonize innate

22

immune responses. Here, we use RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling along SARS-CoV-2

23

infection and comprehensively define the mechanisms that are utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to

24

shutoff cellular protein synthesis. We show SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a global reduction in

25

translation but that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated. Instead, we reveal that

26

infection leads to accelerated degradation of cytosolic cellular mRNAs which facilitates viral

27

takeover of the mRNA pool in infected cells. Moreover, we show that the translation of

28

transcripts whose expression is induced in response to infection, including innate immune genes,

29

is impaired, implying infection prevents newly transcribed cellular mRNAs from accessing the

30

ribosomes. Overall, our results uncover the multipronged strategy employed by SARS-CoV-2 to

31

commandeer the translation machinery and to suppress host defenses.

Introduction:

34

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing

35

coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic 1,2. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus consisting

36

of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of ~30 kb. From the positive strand genomic

37

RNA, two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) are translated, ORF1a (pp1a) and ORF1b

38

(pp1ab). The translation of ORF1b is mediated by a -1 frameshift that allows translation to

39

continue beyond the stop codon of ORF1a. These generate continuous polypeptides which are

40

cleaved into a total of 16 nonstructural proteins (NSP 1-16, Snijder et al., 2016; Sola et al., 2015;

41

Stadler et al., 2003; V’kovski et al., 2020). Among them are the subunits that constitute the

42

RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which in turn transcribes subgenomic RNAs that

43

contain a common 5' leader fused to different segments from the 3′ end of the viral genome 3–5.

44

The different subgenomic RNAs encode 4 conserved structural proteins- spike protein (S),

45

envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N)- and several accessory

46

proteins and non-canonical protein products 7–9.

47

Translation of viral proteins relies solely on the cellular translation machinery; therefore, viruses

48

must commandeer this machinery to translate their own mRNAs. In addition, viruses need to

49

counteract the antiviral response cells mount upon infection 10. The first line of defense applied

50

by infected cells engages the interferon (IFN) pathway, which amplifies signals resulting from

51

detection of intracellular viral components to induce a systemic anti-viral response. Specifically,

52

cells contain various sensors that detect the presence of viral RNAs and promote nuclear

53

translocation of transcription factors, leading to transcription and secretion of type I IFNs 11 .

54

Binding of IFN to its cognate receptor in autocrine and paracrine manners leads to the

55

propagation of the signal and to the transcription and translation of hundreds of interferon

56

stimulated genes that act to hamper viral replication at various stages of the viral life cycle 12. In

57

the case of SARS-CoV-2, interferon response seems to play a critical role in pathogenesis 13–17.

58

In addition, the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 suppresses the IFN response is a key characteristic

59

that distinguishes it from other respiratory viruses 18,19.

60

Viruses utilize various strategies to cause shutoff of host mRNA translation 10, including

61

hampering mRNA processing steps and export, inducing degradation of mRNAs and inhibiting

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.25.398578; this version posted November 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

62

translation. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are known to cause host shutoff 10,20 and several strategies

63

have been proposed for how the beta CoVs may shut-off host protein synthesis and evade

64

immune detection. These include degradation of host mRNA in the nucleus or the cytosol and

65

inhibition of host translation 21,22. Nonetheless, the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 uses these or

66

other strategies remains unclear.

67

NSP1 is the best characterized and most prominent coronavirus host shutoff factor 23. Several

68

recent studies showed SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 binds the 40s ribosome and inhibits translation 24–28.

69

In addition, other SARS-CoV-2 proteins were shown to interfere with cellular gene expression.

70

For example, one of the SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins, ORF6, was suggested to disrupt

71

nucleocytoplasmic transport leading to inhibition of gene expression 29 and several viral proteins

72

have been demonstrated to antagonize IFN-I production and signaling 24,30. Although, different

73

SARS-CoV-2 proteins are implicated in host expression shutoff, a comprehensive picture of the

74

effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cellular gene expression is still lacking.

75

Here we employ RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling along SARS-CoV-2 infection to

76

explore the mechanisms which the virus utilizes to interfere with host protein synthesis. We

77

reveal SARS-CoV-2 uses a multi-faceted approach to shutoff cellular protein production. SARS-

78

CoV-2 infection induces global translation inhibition but surprisingly the translation of viral

79

transcripts is not preferred over their cellular counterparts. Instead we reveal that infection leads

80

to accelerated cellular mRNAs degradation, likely conferred by NSP1. Viral transcripts are

81

refractory to these effects, an evasion potentiated by their 5’UTRs, enabling viral dominance

82

over the mRNA pool in infected cell. Finally, we show that the translation of transcripts whose

83

expression is induced in response to infection, including innate immune genes, is severely

84

impaired. Overall these findings reveal the key mechanisms SARS-CoV-2 is applying to

85

suppress cellular protein synthesis and host defenses.

Results:

88

Simultaneous monitoring of RNA levels and translation during SARS-CoV-2 infection

89

To gain a detailed view of the changes that occur in viral and host translation over the course of

90

SARS-CoV-2 infection, we infected Calu3 cells with SARS-CoV-2 at multiplicity of infection

91

(MOI) of 3 and harvested infected cells at 3, 5, and 8 hours post infection (hpi) as well as

92

uninfected cells. This high MOI infection results in infection of the majority of the cells and thus

93

a synchronous cell population, allowing for molecular dissection of the events along infection.

94

We designed our experiment to simultaneously monitor both RNA levels and translation (Figure

95

1A). Deep sequencing of mRNA (RNA-seq) generates a detailed depiction of transcript levels

96

during infection and this was paired with ribosome profiling, which allows accurate

97

measurement of protein synthesis by capturing the overall in-vivo distribution of ribosomes on a

98

given message 31,32. In order to assess the reproducibility of our experiments we prepared two

99

independent biological replicates for the uninfected and 8hpi time points and both the mRNA

100

and footprint measurements were reproducible (Figure S1A and S1B). Metagene analysis, in

101

which gene profiles are aligned and then averaged, revealed the expected profiles of footprints

102

along mRNAs; ribosome density accumulates from the start codon along the gene body ending at

103

the first in-frame stop codon with pronounced accumulation of ribosomes at the initiation sites

104

and 3 bp periodicity along the gene body (Figure S1C). Using this data, we quantitatively

105

assessed the expression pattern of 8627 cellular transcripts and 12 canonical viral ORFs that are

106

expressed from the genomic and sub-genomic RNAs along SARS-CoV-2 infection.

107

Analysis of the mRNAs and footprints originating from cellular and viral transcripts illustrates

108

SARS-CoV-2’s unprecedented dominance over the mRNA pool. At 8 hpi viral mRNAs comprise

109

almost 90% of the mRNAs in infected cells (Figure 1B). Surprisingly, however, at the same time

110

point, viral mRNAs account for only ~34% of the RNA fragments engaged with ribosomes in the

111

cells (Figure 1C). In order to quantitatively evaluate the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to co-opt the

112

host ribosomes we calculated the relative translation efficiency (TE) of viral and cellular RNA

113

along infection. TE is defined as the ratio of footprints to mRNA reads for a given gene and

114

reflects how well a gene is being translated. We then compared the TE of human genes to that of

115

viral genes at each of the time points along infection. The analysis shows that at 3 hpi viral gene

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.25.398578; this version posted November 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

116

translation efficiencies fall within the general range of cellular gene translation. This indicates

117

that when infection initiates, viral transcripts are translated with efficiencies similar to those of

118

host transcripts. As infection progresses, viral gene translation efficiency relative to cellular

119

genes is significantly reduced (Figure 1D). Since it seems improbable that the virus will promote

120

conditions that are unfavorable to the translation of its mRNA, this relative reduction in

121

translation of viral genes at 5 and 8 hpi may indicate that not all viral RNAs are accessible for

122

translation. Since double-membrane sealed replication compartments are formed to

123

accommodate viral genome replication 33, an appealing possibility is that these compartments

124

sequester a sizable fraction of the viral RNA molecules and thus prevent them from being a part

125

of the translated mRNA pool.

126

By their nature, deep sequencing measurements provide relative values but not absolute

127

quantification of RNA and translation levels. Since SARS-CoV-2 encoded protein, NSP1, was

128

recently shown to interfere with translation by blocking the mRNA entry channel of ribosomes

129

25–28

130

mRNA was not assessed, we next examined if SARS-CoV-2 infection affects global translation

131

and RNA levels. To quantify absolute translation levels, we measured nascent protein synthesis

132

levels using an analogue of puromycin, O-Propargyl Puromycin (OPP), which incorporates into

133

elongating polypeptide chains 34. The nascent polypeptides with incorporated OPP are

134

fluorescently-labeled via a Click reaction and the levels of OPP incorporation into elongating

135

polypeptides is quantified by flow cytometry (Figure S2A and S2B). We infected Calu3 cells

136

with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 3 and measured nascent protein synthesis levels in uninfected

137

cells and at 3, 5 and 8 hpi. We observed a significant reduction in global translation levels

138

already at 3 hpi which was augmented with time, and at 8 hpi translation activity was reduced by

139

50% (Figure 1E). In parallel we measured the total RNA levels and rRNA levels extracted from

140

uninfected cells and at 3, 5, and 8 hpi. This analysis illustrated there are no major changes in

141

total RNA or in rRNA levels along SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure S3A and S3B). Since the vast

142

majority of RNA in cells originates from rRNA and this dominance of rRNA may mask changes

143

in mRNA levels we sequenced total RNA, without rRNA depletion, to assess the relative

144

abundance of cellular and viral mRNAs in uninfected cells and at 3, 5, and 8 hpi. This analysis

145

demonstrates that the pool of mRNA molecules relative to rRNA is growing during infection,

, and since the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 interferes with the overall levels of cellular

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.25.398578; this version posted November 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

146

due to the massive production of viral transcripts but at the same time the relative fraction of

147

cellular mRNA is reduced by approximately 2-fold (Figure1F). This suggests that during

148

infection there is both massive production of viral transcripts and a concomitant substantial

149

reduction in the levels of cellular transcripts.

150

Next, we quantitatively assessed the expression pattern of cellular genes along SARS-CoV-2

151

infection. We clustered the mRNA levels of genes that showed the most significant changes

152

along infection using partitioning clustering, allowing grouping of cellular transcripts into three

153

distinct classes based on similarities in temporal expression profiles in the RNA-seq. Overall, we

154

found that changes in ribosome footprints tracked the changes in transcript abundance (Figure

155

1G), with some exceptions that will be discussed in detail below. This shows that part of the

156

reduction in cellular protein synthesis is driven by the reduction in cellular RNA levels.

157

Interestingly, although the levels of the majority of host transcripts were reduced during SARS-

158

CoV-2 infection, we identified numerous transcripts that were significantly elevated (Figure 1G,

159

cluster 3). We carried out pathway enrichment analysis for each of these three clusters. As

160

expected, the group of upregulated mRNAs (cluster 3) was significantly enriched with genes

161

related to immune response, including Toll receptor Signaling , chemokine and cytokine

162

signaling (Figure 1H and Table S1) and these upregulated genes include IL6 and IL8 which play

163

a significant role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 35 and several IFN stimulated genes like,

164

IFIT1, 2 and 3, IRF1, ISG15 and TNF alpha induced proteins. These measurements and

165

analyses reveal that the shutoff in host protein synthesis is driven by several mechanisms

166

including; general reduction in the translation capacity of infected cells and reduction in the

167

levels of most cellular mRNAs.

168
169

Viral gene expression dynamics along infection

170

We next analyzed viral gene expression dynamics along SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral ORFs are

171

translated from the 30kb genomic RNA or from a nested series of subgenomic RNAs that

172

contain a common 5′ leader fused to different segments from the 3′ end of the viral genome

173

(Figure 2A and V’kovski et al., 2020). Viral transcripts and translation levels significantly

174

increased from 3 to 5 hpi but the relative abundance of some viral transcripts and their translation

175

rates were reduced from 5 to 8 hpi (Figure 2B and 2C). This relative reduction in translation rates

176

of some viral transcripts prompted us to assess the relative translation efficiency of viral genes

177

along infection. Since, as indicated above, the translation efficiency of viral genes compared to

178

their cellular counterparts is relatively reduced along infection (Figure 1D), here we examined

179

how the translation of viral genes is distributed between different viral transcripts at different

180

times post infection. This focused analysis revealed an interesting connection between changes

181

in translation efficiency of viral ORFs and their relative location on the viral genome. ORFs that

182

are located at the 5’ end of the genome showed relative increase in their translation efficiency

183

along infection whereas ORFs that are encoded towards the 3’ end of the genome showed

184

relative reduction in their translation efficiencies and ORFs located in the middle of genome

185

showed no major changes in their relative translation efficiency (Figure 2D). Since all viral

186

subgenomic RNAs share the same 5’UTR these differences in translation capacity according to

187

the location in the genome point to a potential unappreciated role for the 3’UTR (the 3’ portion

188

of which is shared between all transcripts) or for the length of viral transcripts, which varies

189

greatly between viral transcripts (Figure 2A). To examine if this phenomenon reflects a general

190

beta CoVs feature, we analyzed the expression and translation of Mouse Hepatitis Virus strain

191

A59 (MHV) ORFs along MHV infection using published RNA-seq and ribosome profiling data

192

along MHV infection 36. MHV has a similar genomic organization (Figure 2E) and the increase

193

in viral mRNA and translation between 5 and 8 hpi varied between viral ORFs (Figure 2F and

194

2G). Although this phenomenon was not as strong, also in the case of MHV, ORFs that are

195

located at the 5’ end of the genome showed relative increase or no change in their translation

196

efficiency along infection whereas ORFs that are encoded towards the 3’ end of the genome

197

showed relative reduction in their translation efficiency (Figure 2H). Together these results

198

indicate that the 3’UTR or viral gene length are likely regulating the translation efficacy of viral

199

mRNAs along infection.

200

Most SARS-CoV-2 ORFs are 3′-proximal and translated from dedicated subgenomic mRNA

201

(Figure 2A). However several subgenomic RNAs encode for additional out-of-frame ORFs,

202

likely via a leaky scanning mechanism 9,37–39. These include ORFs 7b and ORF9b, which are

203

translated from the ORF7a and N subgenomic RNAs, and two ORFs we recently identified by

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.25.398578; this version posted November 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

204

ribosome profiling 9, that are supported by additional evidence 37,39, ORF3c and ORFS.iORF

205

that are translated from ORF3a and ORF-S subgenomic RNAs. Since scanning efficiency can be

206

regulated by stress conditions 40 we examined if the ratio between the translation of a 3′-proximal

207

ORF and its corresponding out-of-frame ORF (encoded by the same subgenomic RNA) changes

208

during infection. Since ORF9b expression was low in our measurements it was excluded from

209

this analysis. The translation of ORF7b, ORF3c and ORFS.iORF correlated with the expression

210

of the 3′-proximal main ORF, indicating there are no major changes in the efficiency of ribosome

211

scanning of viral transcripts along infection (Figure 2I).

212
213

Cellular mRNAs are degraded during SARS-CoV-2 infection

214

Our results indicate that the levels of the majority of cellular RNA are reduced during SARS-

215

CoV-2 infection and this reduction contributes to the shutoff of cellular protein synthesis.

216

Reduction in cellular RNA levels could be due to interference with RNA production or

217

accelerated RNA degradation. To explore the molecular mechanism, we analyzed if the

218

reduction in cellular transcripts is associated with their subcellular localization. We used

219

measurements of the subcellular localization of transcripts by cytoplasmic and nuclear

220

fractionation41 to assess the importance of subcellular localization. The levels of transcripts that

221

mostly localize to the cytoplasm were more reduced in infected cells compared to transcripts that

222

are mostly nuclear (Figure 3A) and there was a clear correlation between subcellular localization

223

and the extent of reduction in transcript levels following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure S4A).

224

Furthermore, compared to transcripts encoded in the nuclear genome, mitochondrial encoded

225

transcripts were refractory to the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 3B). The specific

226

sensitivity of cytosolic transcripts implies these transcripts may be specifically targeted during

227

SARS-CoV-2 infection. In CoVs, the most prominent and well characterized cellular shutoff

228

protein is NSP1 23. So far, studies on SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 demonstrated it restricts translation by

229

directly binding to the ribosome 40S subunit 25–28, thereby globally inhibiting translation

230

initiation. For SARS-CoV, on top of this translation effect, NSP1 interactions with the 40S was

231

also shown to induce cleavage of translated cellular mRNAs, thereby accelerating their turnover

232

21

. To examine if the reduction in cellular transcripts in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells is coupled to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.25.398578; this version posted November 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

233

their translation we compiled a list of 14 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that localize to the

234

cytoplasm and are well expressed in our data but, as expected, poorly translated (Figure S4B).

235

Relatively to cellular mRNAs, cytoplasmic lncRNAs were less affected by SARS-CoV-2

236

infection (Figure 3C), indicating accelerated turnover of cellular transcripts in infected cells may

237

be related to their translation. Recently, ribosome profiling and RNA-seq were conducted on

238

cells transfected with NSP1 42. Analysis of the RNA expression from this data revealed that

239

ectopic NSP1 expression leads to weaker but similar signatures to the ones we identified in

240

infected cells; stronger reduction of cytosolic transcripts compared to nuclear transcripts,

241

stronger sensitivity of nuclear encoded transcripts, and stronger reduction of translated mRNA

242

compared to cytosolic lncRNAs (Figure S5A-C).

243

We further noticed SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to increased levels of intronic reads in many

244

cellular transcripts (Figures 3D and 3E) indicating SARS-CoV-2 may interfere with cellular

245

mRNA splicing, as was recently suggested 24. However, massive degradation of mature cytosolic

246

mRNAs may also generate a relative increase in intronic reads. We therefore analyzed the ratio

247

of intronic and exonic reads relative to rRNA. Whereas relative to rRNA levels, exonic reads

248

showed drastic reduction along SARS-CoV-2 infection, the intronic reads levels showed a more

249

subtle change (Figure 3F). Furthermore, the increase in the ratio of intronic to exonic reads was

250

greater in genes whose expression was reduced along infection compared to genes whose

251

expression was induced (Figure 3G and Figure S6A), illustrating the relative increase in intronic

252

reads is mostly independent of newly transcribed RNAs. Finally, we also detected more intronic

253

reads in cells that exogenously expressed NSP142 (Figure S6B). Together these results indicate

254

that the increase in intronic reads compared to exonic reads during SARS-CoV-2 infection is

255

largely driven by accelerated degradation of mature cellular transcripts that leads to relative

256

reduction in exonic reads. It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 also directly regulates splicing

257

efficiency, as was recently proposed 24, but this effect seems more subtle. Together these

258

findings indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to accelerated degradation of cytosolic cellular

259

mRNAs and that this degradation significantly affects the production of cellular proteins.

SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR protects viral RNA from NSP1 induced RNA degradation

261

An important aspect of host shutoff during infection is the ability of the virus to hamper the

262

translation of cellular transcripts while recruiting the ribosome to its own transcripts. Although it

263

has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs are refractory to the translation inhibition induced

264

by NSP1 24,43 our measurements indicate that SARS-CoV-2 transcripts are not preferentially

265

translated in infected cells (Figure 1D and 9), that RNA degradation plays a prominent role in

266

remodeling the mRNA pool in infected cells and that SARS-CoV-2 dominates the mRNA pool.

267

All SARS-CoV-2-encoded subgenomic RNAs contain a common 5′ leader sequence that is

268

added during negative-strand synthesis 44. We therefore explored whether the 5’UTR sequence

269

protects viral mRNAs from NSP1 induced degradation. We fused the viral 5’UTR sequence or a

270

short control 5’UTR to the 5′ end of a GFP reporter (Figure 4A) and transfected these constructs

271

together with expression vectors encoding NSP1 or NSP2 (that was used as a control) into 293T

272

cells. We found that NSP1 expression suppresses the production of the control-GFP but not of

273

the 5’UTR-containing GFP (Figure 4B and 4C). We extracted RNA from these cells and

274

observed that the NSP1 induced reduction in control-GFP expression was associated with 15-

275

fold reduction in the RNA GFP levels whereas the levels of the GFP RNA with the SARS-CoV-

276

2 5’UTR were not reduced, and were even slightly increased, by NSP1 expression (Figure 4D).

277

The plasmid we used also contains an mCherry reporter expressed from an independent

278

promoter. Reassuringly NSP1 also induces a reduction in both mCherry protein (Figure S7A and

279

S7B) and RNA levels (Figure S7C) when compared to NSP2. These results indicate that the 5′

280

UTR of viral RNAs provides them protection from NSP1 induced degradation and that this

281

protection contributes to the ability of the virus to dominate the mRNA pool in infected cells.

282

The translation efficiency of transcriptionally induced genes is impaired during infection

283

Our results so far exemplify how SARS-CoV-2 remodels the transcript pool in infected cells. To

284

quantitatively evaluate the role of translational control along SARS-CoV-2 infection, we

285

calculated relative translation efficiency (TE, ratio of footprints to mRNAs for a given gene)

286

along infection. We then centered on genes that showed the strongest change in their relative TE

287

along infection. We clustered these genes into four clusters, based on similarity in their temporal

288

TE profiles, which largely reflect genes whose relative TE is reduced along infection and genes

289

whose relative TE is increased. The mRNA and footprint temporal profiles of these genes reveal

290

a clear signature; the genes whose relative TE along infection was reduced were genes whose

291

mRNA increased during infection but did not show a corresponding increase in footprints

292

(Figure 5A and Figure S8). These genes were enriched in immune response genes (FDR < 10-4)

293

like IRF1, IL-6 and CXCL3. Comparing changes in mRNA and TE levels of cellular genes along

294

infection demonstrates that generally transcripts which are transcriptionally induced following

295

infection show a reduction in their relative TE and vice versa (Figure 5B). This inability of RNA

296

that is elevated in response to infection to reach the ribosomes, may explain why infected cells

297

fail to launch a robust IFN response 13,14. These data demonstrate that the overall capacity of

298

infected cells to generate new proteins is severely impaired.

299
300

Discussion:

301

Many viruses developed varied and sophisticated mechanisms to repress host mRNA translation

302

in order to block the cellular innate immune response and concomitantly allow the translation of

303

viral mRNAs. Specifically, CoVs have evolved specialized mechanisms to hijack the host gene

304

expression machineries, including inhibition of host protein synthesis and induction of

305

endonucleolytic cleavage of host mRNAs 23,45. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 several viral ORFs

306

have been suggested to interfere with viral gene expression 24–28,30, but what occurs during viral

307

infection remained an open question.

308

Using unbiased measurements of translation and RNA expression along SARS-CoV-2 infection,

309

we identified three major courses by which SARS-CoV-2 interferes with cellular gene

310

expression in infected cells; 1. global inhibition of protein translation, 2. degradation of cytosolic

311

cellular transcripts and 3. specific translation inhibition of newly transcribed mRNAs.

312

Disruption of cellular protein production using these three components may represent a multi-

313

pronged mechanism that synergistically acts to suppress the host antiviral response (Figure 5C).

314

These mechanisms may explain the molecular basis of the potent suppression of IFN response

315

observed in animal models and in severe COVID-19 patients 15,18.

316

Despite differences in protein size and mode of action, NSP1 proteins from alpha- and beta-

317

CoVs suppress host gene expression 21,22,46, making Nsp1 a central host shutoff factor of CoVs.

318

Indeed, several studies focused on SARS-CoV-2 encoded NSP1, showing it binds to the 40S

319

ribosomal subunit, leading to reduction in mRNA translation both in vitro and in cells 24–28. Still,

320

how the virus can overcome the NSP1-mediated block of translation and how NSP1 effects come

321

into play during infection remained unclear. We reveal here that in resemblance to what had been

322

described for SARS-CoV NSP1, SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 induces shutdown of host protein

323

translation by two mechanisms: first, it stalls canonical mRNA translation as was reported by

324

others 24–28,41 leading to general reduction in the translation capacity of infected cells. Second,

325

NSP1 leads to accelerated cellular mRNA degradation. SARS-CoV NSP1 induces

326

endonucleolytic cleavage and subsequent degradation of host mRNAs and this activity depends

327

on its binding to the 40S ribosome subunit 21,47. Our results indicate a similar mechanism

328

operates in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells as we show cytosolic RNAs, specifically ones that are

329

being translated, are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2-mediated degradation. several studies

330

have shown that mRNAs with viral 5′ UTR are translated more efficiently compared to control

331

5’UTR in the presence of NSP1 24,27,43 26 but it was further demonstrated that NSP1 inhibits

332

translation of both cellular and a viral 5′ UTR-containing reporter mRNA 27 26 implying viral

333

mRNAs do not simply evade translation inhibition in the context of the 5′ UTR sequence. Our

334

measurements from infected cells support these findings as we show viral RNA are not

335

preferentially translated in infected cells. Instead, using a reporter, we show that the viral 5’UTR

336

renders mRNAs refractory to RNA degradation mediated by NSP1. Together these results

337

support a model in which NSP1 acts as a strong inhibitor of translation, tightly binding

338

ribosomes and reducing the pool of available ribosomes that can engage in translation. At the

339

same time ribosome bound NSP1 leads to accelerated degradation of cellular but not of viral

340

mRNAs providing means for viral mRNA to quickly take over and dominate the mRNA pool.

341

This accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs explains how infected cells switch their translation

342

towards viral mRNAs. In support of this model, we show that within 8 hours 88% of the mRNAs

343

in infected cells is viral. Notably, interactions between SARS-CoV NSP1 and the viral 5′ UTR

344

prevent NSP1-induced RNA cleavage 47, indicating that likely similar mechanisms are applied

345

by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

346

On top of the general translation reduction and cellular mRNA degradation which are likely

347

mediated by NSP1, we also observed that in mRNAs that are being induced in response to

348

infection there is no corresponding increase in footprints, indicating these newly generated

349

transcripts are less likely to engage with ribosomes. Since mRNAs that are induced in infection

350

are enriched in cytokines and IFN induced genes, this distinctive mechanism may provide

351

additional explanation why infected cells fail to mount an efficient anti-viral response. Although

352

we do not know the underlying molecular mechanism, one appealing hypothesis is viral

353

inhibition of cellular mRNA nuclear export. Since SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the cytoplasm,

354

inhibiting the nuclear export of mRNAs can provide unique advantages as it will specifically

355

inhibit cellular mRNA translation and more explicitly it will lead to suppression of the host’s

356

antiviral response genes which are transcriptionally induced and therefore fully depend on

357

efficient nuclear export. ORF6 was recently shown to co-purify with host mRNA export factors

358

48

359

explain the phenotype we observe in infection. Another possibility is that NSP16, which was

360

recently shown to inhibit cellular RNA splicing 24, is driving this phenotype as interference with

361

splicing will prevent efficient nuclear export. Indeed, we show here that infection leads to

362

increased levels of intronic reads in many cellular transcripts. Although our analysis reveals

363

some of this signature is attributed to accelerated degradation of mature cellular transcripts it is

364

likely there is also a processing and splicing defect that leads to more intronic reads and

365

eventually aberrant export.

366

Overall, our study provides an in-depth picture of how SARS-CoV-2 efficiently interferes with

367

cellular gene expression, leading to shutdown of host protein production using a multipronged

368

strategy.

369

and by over expression it disrupts nucleocytoplasmic export 29, providing a candidate that may

Cells and viruses

452

Calu3 cells (ATCC HTB-55) were cultured in 6-well or 10cm plates with RPMI supplemented

453

with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), MEM non-essential amino acids, 2mM L-Glutamine,

454

100Units/ml Penicillin and 1% Na-pyruvate. Monolayers were washed once with RPMI without

455

FBS and infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3, in the

456

presence of 20 μg per ml TPCK trypsin (Thermo scientific). Plates were incubated for 1 hour at

457

37oC to allow viral adsorption. Then RPMI medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum,

passages) and tittered on Vero E6 cells and then sequenced 9 before it was used. Handling and

462

working with SARS-CoV-2 virus was conducted in a BSL3 facility in accordance with the

stood on ice for 2h and subsequent Ribo-seq library generation was performed as previously

Sequence alignment, metagene analysis

490

Sequencing reads were aligned as previously described 51. Briefly, linker

491

(CTGTAGGCACCATCAAT) and poly-A sequences were removed and the remaining reads

492

were aligned to the Hg19 and to the SARS-Cov-2 genome (Genebank NC_045512.2) with 3

493

changes to match the used strain (BetaCoV/Germany/BavPat1/2020 EPI_ISL_406862),

494

241:C−>T, 3037:C−>T, 23403:A−>G]. Alignment was performed using Bowtie v1.1.2 52 with

495

maximum two mismatches per read. Reads that were not aligned to the genome were aligned to

496

the transcriptome and to SARS-CoV-2 junctions that were recently annotated 44. The aligned

497

position on the genome was determined as the 5’ position of RNA-seq reads, and for Ribo-seq

498

reads the p-site of the ribosome was calculated according to read length using the off-set from

499

the 5’ end of the reads that was calculated from canonical cellular ORFs. The offsets used are

500

+12 for reads that were 28-29 bp and +13 for reads that were 30-33 bp. Reads that were in

501

different length were discarded. In all figures presenting ribosome densities data, all footprint

502

lengths (28-33bp) are presented.

503

Junctions spanning reads were quantified using STAR 2.5.3a aligner 53, with running flags as

504

suggested by 44, to overcome filtering of non-canonical junctions. Reads aligned to multiple

505

locations were discarded 44.

506

For the metagene analysis only genes with more than 10 reads were used. For each gene,

507

normalization was done to its maximum signal and each position was normalized to the number

508

of genes contributing to the position.

509

Filtering of genes, quantification and RPKM normalization

510

For analysis of cellular genes, the genes were filtered according to the number of reads as

511

follows. The number of reads on a gene in each replicate, from at least one of the conditions

512

(uninfected or 8hr) had to be greater than 50 for the mRNA and greater than 25 for the FP. For

513

heatmaps and clustering, gene filtering was done according to mRNA as described above, and

514

genes with zero reads in any of the samples (mRNA and FP of all time points) were excluded.

515

Histone genes were excluded. Read coverage on genes was normalized to units of RPKM in

516

order to normalize for gene length and for sequencing depth. For analysis comparing host and

517

viral genes, the RPKM was calculated based on the total number of reads of both the host and the

518

virus. For analysis concentrating on cellular genes alone, the RPKM was calculated based on the

519

total number of host reads, and the RPKM values were further scaled to keep the number of total

520

reads equal across samples. The scale factors for RNA-seq were calculated from the ratio of the

521

host mRNA reads to total reads, including viral, rRNA and tRNA reads. in the total RNA

522

sequencing (without polyA selection), and the scale factors for footprints were calculated from

523

the fraction of host reads from the total aligned ribosome profiling reads, including viral and host

524

reads.

525

Since the viral RNAs are widely overlapping, RNA-seq RPKM levels of viral genes were

526

computed with deconvolution as detailed here. First, values for each gene were calculated by

527

subtracting the RPKM of an ORF from the RPKM of the ORF located just upstream of it in the

528

genome. Then, for subgenomic RNAs, leader-body junction counts were counted based on

529

STAR alignment number of uniquely mapped reads crossing the junction. Finally, based on the

530

correlation between the deconvoluted RPKM and junction abundance of the subgenomic RNAs,

534

To avoid biases from intron read count, genes without introns, or where at least one of the

535

introns is overlapping with an exon of another gene were excluded. In addition, genes with low

536

number of reads ( < 20 on the exons, < 2 on the introns) were ignored. The number of reads on

537

exons and introns was normalized by the total length of the exons and introns respectively to get

538

quantification proportional to the number of molecules. Finally, the normalized number of reads

539

on the introns was calculated as percentage of the normalized number of reads on the exons.

540

Statistical significance (in figure 3E) was tested using a paired t-test on the log values of the

541

percentage (with offset of 0.1 to overcome zero values).

542

Comparison of cytosolic lncRNAs and mitochondrial mRNAs

543

The list of cytosolic lncRNAs is based on 41. The list of 14 lncRNAs (with number of reads >=

544

50) that were used in the analysis are given in supplementary table 2. The lncRNAs were

545

compared to protein coding genes, and mitochondrial encoded mRNAs were compared to

546

nuclear encoded mRNAs. Statistical significance was tested using Wilcoxon rank test on the log

547

fold change (compared to uninfected) of the RPKM values.

548

Protein synthesis measurement using O-Propargyl Puromycin (OPP)

549

OPP assay (OPP, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was carried out following the manufacturer’s

550

instructions. Briefly, cells were collected following treatment with 10μM O-Propargyl

551

Puromycin for 30 minutes at 37 ֯C. The cells were then fixed for 15 minutes in 3.7%

552

formaldehyde, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 minutes. OPP was then

553

fluorescently labeled by a 30 minute incubation in Click-iT® Plus OPP reaction cocktail with

554

Alexa Fluor®594 picolyl azide (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were analyzed using BD LSRII

555

flow cytometer.

Pathway enrichment analysis

558

Enrichment analysis of cellular pathways in specific gene clusters was done with PANTHER

559

version 15.0, with default settings and the PANTHER pathways data set 54,55.

560

Reporter assay

561

pLVX-EF1alpha-SARS-CoV-2-nsp1-2XStrep-IRES-Puro and pLVX-EF1alpha-SARS-CoV-2-

562

nsp2-2XStrep-IRES-Puro were kindly provided by Nevan Krogan, University of California, San

563

Francisco.

564

The viral 5’UTR was constructed based on nucleotides 4-265 of the reported sequence of SARS-

565

CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512.2) by sequential annealing of DNA oligonucleotides

566

(IDT, 5’UTR oligo_1-5 listed in the table below). The coding sequence for the first 12 amino

567

acids (aa) of ORF1a as well as the AcGFP homology region were added to the 5’UTR by two

568

PCR amplifications. For the 5’UTR-less control plasmid, the 12 aa region with AcGFP

569

homology was ordered from Sigma-Aldrich as oligonucleotides. The viral 5’UTR with the 12 aa

570

region and the 12 aa region on its own were cloned into pAcGFP1-C1 (Takara Biotech) using

571

restriction-free cloning. The entire expression cassette from the promoter to the poly-A site was

572

amplified and cloned into pDecko-mCherry (Addgene plasmid #78534) using restriction-free

573

cloning. Primers for PCR amplification of fragments were ordered from Sigma-Aldrich. All

574

primers and oligonucleotides used for cloning are listed in the table below.

Figure 1: Global reduction of translation and in cellular mRNA levels along SARS-CoV-2 Infection
(A) Calu3 cells were left uninfected or were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=3) for 3, 5 or 8 hours and harveﬆed for RNA-seq and
for Ribo-seq. (B and C) Percentage of reads that aligned to human or viral transcripts from the sum of aligned reads shown for
mRNAs (B) and footprints (C) in uninfected cells and in cells harveﬆed at 3, 5 and 8 hpi. (D) Cumulative TE diﬆribution among wellexpressed human (black points) and viral (colored points) genes at 3, 5 and 8 hpi. (E) Protein synthesis measurement by flow
cytometry of Calu3 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 3) for 3, 5 and 8 hpi or an uninfected control following O-Propargyl
Puromycin (OPP) incorporation and fluorescent labelling. (F) Percent of reads that aligned to the human or viral transcripts from the
sum of total RNA reads in uninfected cells and in cells harveﬆed at, 3, 5 and 8 hpi. (G) Heat map presenting relative mRNA and
footprints expression of well-expressed human transcripts that showed the moﬆ significant changes in their mRNA levels at 8 hpi
relative to uninfected, across time points during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Shown are expression levels scaled by gene after partitioning
cluﬆering. Three main cluﬆers are marked on the right. (H) Summary of pathway enrichment analysis of genes enriched in cluﬆer 3
(upregulated genes). Dot size reﬂects the number of genes from each pathway included in the teﬆed set, and dot color reﬂects the false
discovery rate (FDR) of the pathway enrichment.

Figure 5: The translation of induced transcripts is impaired during infection
(A) Heat map presenting relative TE, mRNA and footprints (FP) of human genes that showed the moﬆ signiﬁcant
changes in their relative TE along SARS-CoV-2 infection. Shown are relative expression ratios after partitioning
cluﬆering based on changes in relative TE values. (B) Scatter plot presenting cellular transcript levels in
uninfected cells compared to 8hpi. Genes are colored based on the relative change in their TE between uninfected
and 8hpi. Central cytokines and IFN ﬆimulated genes are labeled. (C) A model of how SARS-CoV-2 suppresses
hoﬆ gene expression through multi-pronged approach: 1. Global translation reduction; 2. Degradation of
cytosolic cellular mRNAs; 3. Speciﬁc translation inhibition of newly synthesized cellular mRNAs.
