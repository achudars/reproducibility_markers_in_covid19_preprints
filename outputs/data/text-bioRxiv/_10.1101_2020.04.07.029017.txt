Abstract
Background: There is a critical need for effective therapies that are immediately
available to control the spread of COVID-19 disease. In this study, we assessed
currently marketed intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) products for antibodies against
human common coronaviruses that may cross-react with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Methods: Gamunex®-C and Flebogamma® DIF (Grifols) IVIG were tested against
several betacoronaviruses antigens using ELISA techniques: HCoV (undetermined
antigen), HCoV-HKU1 (N protein), SARS-CoV (culture lysate), MERS-CoV (N
protein; S1 protein/RBD; S protein), and SARS-CoV-2 (S1 protein). Results: Both IVIG
products showed consistent reactivity to components of the tested viruses. Positive
cross-reactivity was seen in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. For SARSCoV-2, positive reactivity was observed at IVIG concentrations ranging from 100
µg/mL with Gamunex-C to 1 mg/mL with Flebogamma 5% DIF. Conclusion:
Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF IVIG contain antibodies reacting against SARSCoV-2 antigens. These preparations may be useful for immediate treatment of COVID19 disease.

Introduction
The outbreak of a novel viral respiratory disease, COVID-19, is caused by infection
with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Due to its extreme transmissibility, COVID-19 has spread dramatically within weeks
since the first recognition in China in late December 2019 [1]. Increased human
mobility as a global phenomenon has created favorable conditions for COVID-19 to
become a pandemic.
Although symptoms are typically mild, in some patient groups COVID-19 can progress
to severe respiratory failure which is associated with significant morbidity and
mortality. These patients with severe disease are straining the available critical care
resources of the most-affected countries [2]. In the short term, the lack of a vaccine and
therapeutic agents of proven efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 further aggravates this
trend. This critical situation demands a reliable therapy that is immediately available to
control the spread of the disease. Convalescent plasma or plasma-derived
immunoglobulin (IG), either polyvalent IG (prepared from pooled plasma from
thousands of healthy donors) or hyperimmune IG (prepared from the plasma of donors
with high titers of antibody against a specific antigen), have been historically used as
the fastest therapeutic option in outbreaks of emergent or re-emergent infections [3].
Four main common human coronaviruses have been identified so far: HCoV-229E,
HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. It is thought that most humans become
infected by coronaviruses during their lifetime [4]. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel emerging
coronavirus. It joins SARS-CoV, responsible for the SARS outbreak in 2003 and
MERS-CoV, responsible for the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in
2012. Since coronavirus infections induce virus-neutralizing antibodies, convalescent
plasma therapy was successfully used in both SARS [5, 6] and MERS [7] patients.
Common human coronaviruses constantly circulate all around the globe and are
accountable for a large proportion of respiratory infections, which in most cases are
mild. Because of this ubiquity, antibodies against human common coronaviruses are
present in the normal population. Since intravenous IG (IVIG) are polyvalent IG
prepared from plasma from thousands of donors, this product covers a large spectrum of

immunity of the general population and, as expected, includes anti-coronaviruses
antibodies.
It is important to note that coronaviruses of the same subgroup, particularly
betacoronaviruses such as HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and
MERS-CoV, show some cross-reactivity in antigenic responses. Cross-reactivity
between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with other common human betacoronaviruses has
been reported with some neutralization [8-10]. The fact that the new betacoronavirus
SARS-CoV-2 is directly related to SARS-CoV (they share more than 90% sequence
homology) [11] suggests that antigenic cross-reactivity between them is possible, at
least for some proteins.
To explore this potential therapeutic pathway, we designed this study to detect
antibodies against common human coronaviruses in IVIG products that may cross-react
with the new SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Material and Methods
Experimental design
Gamunex®-C (Grifols Therapeutics Inc., Raleigh NC, US) and Flebogamma® dual
inactivation and filtration (DIF) (Instituto Grifols S.A., Barcelona, Spain) IVIG were
tested for cross-reactivity against several betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV,
MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 antigens, using ELISA techniques.
IVIG products
Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF are highly purified, unmodified human IVIG
products manufactured from plasma collected from donors in the US and/or several
European countries. Gamunex-C is available in 100 mg/mL (10%) while Flebogamma
DIF is available in 50 mg/mL and 100 mg/mL (5% and 10%) IgG concentrations. Both
IVIG manufacturing processes contain dedicated steps with high virus clearance
capacity, such as solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment, heat treatment, caprylate treatment
and Planova™ nanofiltration down to 20 nm pore size.

Coronaviruses IgG ELISA kits
The following kits were used for the qualitative determination of IgG class antibodies
against human coronaviruses: abx052609 Human Coronavirus IgG ELISA kit (Abbexa,
Cambridge, UK), against an undetermined antigen; MBS9301037, HCoV-HKU-IgG
ELISA kit (MyBioSource, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), against N protein; DEIA1035.
SARS Coronavirus IgG ELISA kit (Creative Diagnostics, Shirley, NY, USA), against
virus lysate; RV-402100-1, Human Anti-MERS-NP IgG ELISA Kit (Alpha Diagnostic
Intl. Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA), against N protein; RV-402400-1, Human AntiMERS-RBD IgG ELISA Kit (Alpha Diagnostic Intl. Inc.), against receptor-binding
domain (RBD) of S1 subunit spike protein (S1/RBD): RV-402300-1, Human AntiMERS-S2 IgG ELISA Kit (Alpha Diagnostic Intl. Inc.), against S2 subunit spike
protein; RV-405200 (formerly RV-404100-1), Human Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Virus Spike 1
[S1] IgG ELISA Kit (Alpha Diagnostic Intl. Inc.), against S1 subunit spike protein. In
all cases the determinations were carried out following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Sample preparation and testing
IVIG samples were serially diluted using the buffer solutions provided in each IgG
ELISA kit. With the IVIG 5% product, the dilution series was: neat (undiluted), 1:5,
1:50, 1:500, 1:1000, and 1:5000. With the IVIG 10% product, the dilution series was:
neat, 1:10, 1:100, 1;1000, 1:2000, and 1:10000. Therefore, final IgG concentrations of
the samples were: 50 mg/mL, 100 mg/mL, 10 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, 100 µg/mL, 50 µg/mL,
and 10 µg/mL. In SARS-CoV-2 tests, additional dilutions of 1:300 (333 µg/mL) and
1:600 (167 µg/mL) were included.
Reactivity against the coronavirus antigens in the different ELISA kits was rated as
negative (-) if no reactivity was observed even with neat IVIG, or positive (+) if the
lowest IVIG dilution demonstrated reactivity. The number of test replicates performed
was 2-3 for Gamunex-C, 2-4 for Flebogamma 10% DIF, and 1-2 for Flebogamma 5%
DIF.
Results
Both Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF showed consistent reactivity to components of
the tested viruses including a variety of virus proteins, except for the N-protein from

HCoV-HKU1. There was no reactivity to this protein even with undiluted IVIG
samples.
As shown in Table 1, positive reactivity was particularly apparent in SARS-CoV,
MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. In the case of MERS-CoV, positive reactivity was
observed in IVIG samples down to 1:2000 dilution (50 µg/mL) for N protein, S1-RBD
protein and S2 protein. For SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein, positive reactivity ranged from an
IVIG concentration of 100 µg/mL with Gamunex-C to 1 mg/mL with Flebogamma 5%
DIF (Table 1).
Reactivity to HCoV (betacoronavirus undetermined antigen) was also observed,
although less consistently: negative for Gamunex, but positive for Flebogamma DIF at
low dilutions (Table 1).
Discussion
The need for readily available effective therapies to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection is
compelling. In this study, we considered whether IVIG treatment could contribute to
COVID-19 disease management. To test this hypothesis, known currently available
IVIG products, Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF, were tested for cross-reactivity with
SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We
found significant cross-reactivity to components of all tested viruses including the S1
protein of SARS-CoV-2, the protein responsible for virion attachment to the host cell
and neutralization [12].
The consistency of our cross-reactivity results among the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV viruses, is noteworthy. This replicates with the new SARS-CoV-2, the
cross-reactivity already reported for SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV with other human
betacoronaviruses [8-10]. Importantly, Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF were
confirmed to contain antibodies reacting against SARS-CoV-2 antigens, which could be
important in the quest for an immediate therapy for COVID-19.
ELISA results for the undetermined antigen of HCoV were also mostly positive. This
was in contrast to HCoV-HKU1, which had negative reactivity. HCoV-HKU1 was
discovered in 2005 in Hong Kong and, although it did not result in an outbreak and had
only restricted spread, this virus is probably still circulating in the population [13, 14].

However, negativity of an IVIG reaction using a single ELISA coronavirus kit does not
mean that such IVIG does not contain antibodies against this pathogen. ELISA
sensitivity relies on factors such as the antigen used, the sequence, the organism used to
produce it, and the amount of material coated. ELISA results should only be compared
qualitatively, since comparison of the results between different kits is difficult based on
differences in sensitivity, and there is no gold standard for quantification. In addition,
there is scarcity of tests for common coronaviruses.
It has been observed that patients that develop a more severe clinical course of SARSCoV-2 infection have higher plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting a
possible cytokine storm associated with the disease severity [15]. IVIG products have
been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of inflammatory disorders [16]. To
date, a number of possible mechanisms for the immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory effects of IVIG therapy have been described [17, 18], including anticomplement effects [19], anti-idiotypic neutralization of pathogenic autoantibodies [20],
immune regulation via an inhibitory Fc receptor [16, 21], enhancement of regulatory T
cells [22] and inhibition of Th17 differentiation [23]. Thus, IVIG may mediate a wide
variety of biological and immunomodulatory effects via various types of blood cells
[23]. Altogether, these known immunomodulatory effects of IVIG products could be
beneficial in COVID-19 disease management. Anecdotally, there was a case series
report describing a positive effect of high dose IVIG in three patients with COVID-19
[24]. It should be noted that IVIG products are generally deemed safe and welltolerated. Most of their adverse effects are mild and transient [25].
In conclusion, we consistently observed cross-reactivity of IVIG products with SARSCoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV using ELISAs from different manufactures. This
evidence supports the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 cross-reacting antibodies in these
IVIG preparations. These results together with the known immune properties of IVIG,
suggest a potential positive contribution of currently available IVIG products to
COVID-19 disease management. Further steps to confirm the functionality of IVIG
antibodies such are neutralization studies are warranted.
