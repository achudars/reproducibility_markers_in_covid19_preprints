Abstract

10

COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It has

11

become a global pandemic and its frequent mutations may pose new challenges for vaccine design. During

12

viral infection, the Spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2 binds the human host cell receptor ACE2, enabling the virus

13

to enter the host cell. Both the Spike and ACE2 are densely glycosylated, and it is unclear how distinctive

14

glycan types may modulate the interaction of RBD and ACE2. Detailed understanding of these determinants

15

is key for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. To this end, we perform extensive all-atom simu-

16

lations of the (i) RBD-ACE2 complex without glycans, (ii) RBD-ACE2 with oligomannose MAN9 glycans

17

in ACE2, and (iii) RBD-ACE2 with complex FA2 glycans in ACE2. These simulations identify the key

18

residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface that form contacts with higher probabilities, thus providing a quanti-

19

tative evaluation that complements recent structural studies. Notably, we find that this RBD-ACE2 contact

20

signature is not altered by the presence of different glycoforms, suggesting that RBD-ACE2 interaction is

21

robust. Applying our simulated results, we illustrate how the recently prevalent N501Y mutation may al-

22

ter specific interactions with host ACE2 that facilitate the virus-host binding. Furthermore, our simulations

23

reveal how the glycan on Asn90 of ACE2 can play a distinct role in the binding and unbinding of RBD.

24

Finally, an energetics analysis shows that MAN9 glycans on ACE2 decrease RBD-ACE2 affinity, while FA2

25

glycans lead to enhanced binding of the complex. Together, our results provide a more comprehensive pic-

26

ture of the detailed interplay between virus and human receptor, which is much needed for the discovery of

27

effective treatments that aim at modulating the physical-chemical properties of this virus.

INTRODUCTION

29

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the

30

highly contagious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It has led to an ongoing global pan-

31

demic where emerging mutations may require continuous development of novel therapeutic strate-

32

gies. Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 uses the Spike glycoprotein to interact with

33

human host cells during viral infection [1, 2]. Specifically, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of

34

the Spike glycoprotein binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cell

35

(Figure 1). This facilitates fusion of virus and host cell membranes, leading to entry of the virus

36

into the cell.

37

Since RBD binding to ACE2 is key to viral entry, this interaction is a major target for develop-

38

ment of antibody therapeutics and vaccine design. Mutations in the RBD can alter virus-receptor

39

interaction [3, 4], and thus, viral infectivity. Recent structural studies have revealed the residue-

40

residue contacts between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2, suggesting possible interactions that may

41

determine the stability of the complex [5–7]. However, from these static data, it is unclear which of

42

these residues are the critical ones that form interactions most frequently. While a recent computa-

43

tional study has addressed this question [8], their results are based on relatively short simulations

44

(∼ 5 µs) that may not achieve accurate statistics. In addition, both the viral Spike and host recep-

45

tor ACE2 are densely glycosylated with asparagine linked N-glycans [9, 10]. Since some of these

46

glycans are spatially located near the RBD-ACE2 interface (Figure 1), it is necessary to assess

47

how they may affect the binding affinity of RBD to ACE2. Previous experiments have elucidated

48

some roles of glycans where they, for instance, can impact antibody interactions and epitope ex-

49

posure [11]. Furthermore, different glycan types with characteristic structures can be critical for

50

pathogen-host interaction [12, 13]. Other experiments have shown that disruption of ACE2 glyco-

51

sylation can impair SARS-CoV-1 viral entry into cells [14]. However, due to structural complexity

52

and heterogeneity of glycans, together with limited instrumental sensitivity [15], it is unclear how

53

individual glycan types could distinctly modulate RBD binding. Such thorough understanding is

54

needed to suggest more precise strategies for future experiments that seek to design effective treat-

55

ments. For this purpose, we apply extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (> 200 µs) that

56

elucidate the detailed interplay between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and host ACE2, and the role of dif-

57

ferent glycan types during this process. Specifically, we study RBD-ACE2 complexes that either

58

have a) mannose-9 (MAN9) glycans attached to six ACE2 residues: i.e. Asn53, Asn90, Asn103,

59

Asn322, Asn432, and Asn546 or b) sialated complex flucosylated 2-antennae (FA2) glycans at-

60

tached to the same afore-mentioned ACE2 residues. In both of these glycan-included models, the

61

Spike RBD is built with a single FA2 glycan at Asn343 (see SI Methods for details).

62

To dissect the determinants of RBD-ACE2 binding, we performed all-atom explicit-solvent

63

simulations of three systems: (i) the RBD-ACE2 complex without glycans (Figure 1a), (ii) RBD-

64

ACE2 with six MAN9 glycans on ACE2 and one FA2 glycan on RBD (Figure 1b, S1), and (iii)

65

RBD-ACE2 with six FA2 glycans on ACE2 and one FA2 glycan on RBD (Figure 1c). These three

66

separate sets of simulations comprise of 90 trajectories that have a combined simulated time of

67

more than 225 µs. Statistical analysis of these long simulations reveal the key residues of RBD and

68

ACE2, which form binding contacts with higher probabilities. This provides a complementary view

69

to structural data by quantifying the significance of identified interactions. Importantly, we find that

70

this RBD-ACE2 contact signature is not affected by the presence of MAN9 or FA2 glycans, sug-

71

gesting RBD-ACE2 contacts are inherently robust. Using our simulated interactions as foundation,

72

we evaluate the effect of N501Y, a recent mutation that accounts for the majority of new infections

73

in South East England. Specifically, we show that N501Y in RBD introduces additional stabilizing

74

interactions with Y41 and K353 of ACE2, which can contribute to enhanced infectivity of the new

75

strain. Furthermore, we show that the glycan on Asn90 of ACE2 (regardless whether MAN9 or

76

FA2) contacts the RBD with distinctly higher probabilities, compared to the remaining glycans on

77

ACE2. This indicates that the Asn90 glycan may play a critical role in binding/unbinding events

78

of RBD, as previously suggested by atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments [16], biolayer

79

interferometry [17], and other biochemical assays [18]. Finally, an analysis of binding energetics

80

demonstrates that each glycan type is associated with distinct enthalpic contributions to binding

81

affinity. Specifically, we show that MAN9 glycans on ACE2 lead to weaker RBD-ACE2 binding,

82

while the FA2 glycans, with their negatively charged sialic acid tips, stabilize the complex. To-

83

gether, the results provide a quantitative framework that allows future studies to more precisely

84

modulate the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and improve immunogen design.

RESULTS

86

Contacts between ACE2 and RBD are not altered by the presence of glycans

87

To obtain a detailed picture of how SARS-CoV-2 RBD interacts with human receptor ACE2, it

88

is necessary to identify the residues that form close contacts at the RBD-ACE2 interface. Further-

89

more, we investigate how this RBD-ACE2 interaction is affected by different glycan species that

90

are present on the ACE2 surface. To this end, we performed three separate sets of all-atom explicit-

91

solvent simulations of (i) the RBD-ACE2 complex without glycans (Figure 1a), (ii) RBD-ACE2

92

with MAN9 glycans on ACE2 (Figure 1b), and (iii) RBD-ACE2 with FA2 glycans on ACE2 (Fig-

93

ure 1c). For each simulation set, we calculated the probability of ACE2 and RBD residues forming

94

contacts with each other (Figure 2a-c). Here, a contact is considered formed if the smallest distance

95

between the heavy atoms of two amino acid residues is within 4 Å.

96

The contact maps for the non-glycan (Figure 2a), MAN9-included (Figure 2b), and FA2-

97

included (Figure 2c) simulations are highly similar among each other, suggesting that RBD-ACE2

98

protein contact formation is virtually independent of the presence of glycans. To describe how gly-

99

cans may affect the movement of the RBD domain relative to ACE2, we calculated the root mean

100

square deviation (rmsd) of the C-alpha atoms of RBD after alignment of ACE2, as a function of

101

time. From this, we calculated the distribution of rmsd values for each simulation set (Figure 2d).

102

The distributions for the non-glycan and glycan-included simulations resemble each other closely,

103

indicating that the glycans do not affect the orientation of RBD relative to ACE2. Specifically, in

104

all simulations, the RBD fluctuates about a native-like basin that is located at small rmsd values

105

(rmsd ≈ 0.5 nm, Figure 2d). Small rmsd values suggest that this ensemble corresponds to the RBD-

106

ACE2 configuration used as reference for the rmsd calculations. Here, the structure by Ref. [5]

107

(PDB ID: 6M0J, Figure 1a) was used as reference. Together, the unperturbed results for contact

108

formation (Figure 2a-c) and rmsd distributions (Figure 2d) demonstrate that features including

109

interactions and relative orientations of RBD-ACE2 are robust to the presence of glycans.

110

Quantifying the relative significance of RBD-ACE2 contacts

111

To further characterize the RBD-ACE2 interaction profile, we defined persistent contacts as

112

those that occur in at least 60% of the sampled configurations. Our simulations reveal that there

113

are 25 RBD-ACE2 contacts that form persistently, which may be the key interactions in the bind-

114

ing of the complex (Figure 2e and Table S1). The majority of persistent contacts involve residues

115

in the N-terminal helix of ACE2, which interact with the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of RBD

116

(Figure 2e). Representative RBD-ACE2 interactions that occur most frequently in the simulations

117

include: Y453-H34, F456-T27, N487-Y83, Y489-F28, N501-K353, G502-K353, and Y505-K353

118

(first and second labels denote RBD and ACE2 residues, respectively). These pairs form with at

119

least 90% probability, suggesting they may play a particularly prominent role in the interplay be-

120

tween the virus’ RBD and human receptor (see Table S1 for a complete list of all 25 persistent

121

contacts). In fact, of these seven RBD residues, two are sites where the common mutations Y453F

122

and N501Y occur, and the remaining five are highly conserved among pandemic strains. Specif-

123

ically, Y453F is a mutation that originates from minks in Denmark and has been found in over

124

1, 400 out of ∼ 314, 000 sequences recorded globally (i.e. 0.45% global frequency). The N501Y

125

RBD mutation, which appears mostly in the B.1.1.7 strain (or UK strain), has been found in over

126

18, 000 out of ∼ 314, 000 sequences (i.e. 5.7% global frequency). The B.1.1.7 strain, first detected

127

in the UK in September 2020, has become a dominant variant of the virus and is believed to be

128

more transmissible. In the next section further below, we apply our contact statistics, as shown in

129

Figure 2a, to assess how the N501Y mutation in B.1.1.7 may facilitate virus-receptor binding.

130

To discuss our results in view of recent experimental structures, we used the contact definition

131

described above and identified all RBD-ACE2 contacts that are present in PDB IDs: 6M0J [5],

132

6M17 [6], and 6VW1 [7]. We find that these structures together implicate a total of 42 con-

133

tacts. Since experimental models are based on average coordinates, it is not clear to what ex-

134

tent these 42 interactions statistically form or break in solution. Our simulations reveal that the

135

experimentally-derived contacts can have substantially diverse probabilities of forming, ranging

136

between P = 0.04–0.98 (Table S1). Notably, all 25 persistent contacts captured by the simulations

137

represent a subset of those 42 experimentally-reported interactions. Thus, our analysis demon-

138

strates that while recent structures have revealed the possible interactions, the present calculations

139

quantify their relative involvement, which can aid in estimating the potential impact of mutations.

140

We note that previous shorter simulations (∼ 5 µs) [8] implicated a significantly higher number of

141

persistent contacts than identified by our long simulations (∼ 225µs). Such discrepancy highlights

142

the importance of extensive sampling as performed here to obtain accurate statistics. Using large

143

sets of simulation data, we have provided a more precise evaluation of RBD-ACE2 contacts, and

144

have additionally shown that these interactions are not perturbed by the presence of MAN9 or FA2

145

glycans. Below, we demonstrate how our contact data may be applied to evaluate potential con-

146

sequences of specific mutations, such as N501Y in the recently prevalent B.1.1.7 strain from the

147

UK.

148

Simulated interactions help assess the effects of mutations, such as N501Y in RBD

149

The detailed contact interactions, as revealed by our simulations (Figure 2a), provide a basis

150

that can help evaluate the effects of mutations. In recent months, the new variant of SARS-CoV-2

151

B.1.1.7 (or UK strain), carrying the mutation N501Y in the RBD (Figure 3), reportedly accounts

152

for over 60% of new COVID-19 cases in South East England. This N501Y variant is associated

153

with increased affinity to host receptor [3], but the molecular factors responsible for this is unclear.

154

Since the N501Y mutation site is at the RBD-ACE2 binding interface (Figure 3a), we will examine

155

how this mutation may modulate the virus-host interaction, a factor that can determine infectivity.

156

For this, we performed in-silico mutagenesis of N501Y in the RBD-ACE2 complex, using the

157

FoldX software [19]. Utilizing the interaction statistics from Figure 2a as basis, together with a

158

structural and chemical-physical analysis, we argue below how the new N501Y strain facilitates

159

the binding of RBD to ACE2, which may contribute to enhanced infectivity.

160

To describe the consequences of N501Y, we first identify all ACE2 residues that frequently

161

interact with N501, the mutation site in RBD. From the simulations, N501 forms contacts with

162

Y41 and K353 of host ACE2 in 74% and 93% of the sampled configurations, respectively (see

163

Figure 2a and Table S1). The significant interactions provide reason to specifically focus on these

164

two host residues and assess how their contact formation with the N501Y mutation may alter

165

stability (Figure 3b). For this, we note that N501Y would enable the formation of stabilizing cation-

166

π interaction with K353 of ACE2. In addition, the longer side chain of N501Y (relative to N501)

167

may facilitate the intermolecular hydrogen-bonding between the OH group of N501Y (tyrosine)

168

and ACE2 residues, including K353 (Figure 3b). It has been shown that hydrogen bonds by tyrosine

169

OH groups can be a significant contributor to stability [20]. Hence, a tyrosine (N501Y) side chain

170

that allows for more favorable hydrogen bonds between molecules would further facilitate binding.

171

Moreover, the N501Y mutation introduces additional stabilizing contributions: i.e. the aromatic-

172

aromatic interaction between N501Y and Y41 (i.e. π-stacking; Figure 3b). Notably, N501Y would
6

173

lead to enhanced hydrophobic effects in the inside of the binding surface. This mutation would

174

therefore create a more protein core-like environment, which stabilizes the RBD-ACE2 coupling.

175

Together, our analysis demonstrates how N501Y implicates numerous energetic factors whose

176

combined effect likely facilitates the binding of the mutated virus to host cells. This interpretation

177

is consistent with the mutational experiments by Starr et al. [3] that have demonstrated enhanced

178

RBD-ACE2 affinity through N501Y.

179

RBD forms contacts with Asn90 glycan of ACE2 more frequently than other glycans

180

Some glycans on ACE2 are located near the RBD-ACE2 interface (Figures 1b,c). While we

181

have shown that glycans do not alter the contact signature of ACE2 and RBD, it is unclear how and

182

to what extent glycans of the host may interact with viral RBD. Understanding precisely which

183

glycans form close contacts with RBD will provide a more comprehensive view of the factors

184

determining affinity and may suggest additional strategies to modulate binding.

185

To describe RBD-glycan interaction, we calculated the probabilities of RBD residues forming

186

contacts with any glycan that is attached to ACE2 (Figure 4). This analysis was performed for the

187

simulation sets that either included MAN9 (cf. Figure 1b) or FA2 glycans (cf. Figure 1c) on ACE2.

188

In both MAN9 and FA2 simulations (Figures 4a,b), ACE2 glycans on Asn53, Asn90, Asn103,

189

and Asn322 form contacts with the RBD. Of these four glycans, the ones on Asn53, Asn103, and

190

Asn322 have lower contact probabilities (i.e. P ≤ 30%), suggesting that their interaction with

191

RBD is more transient despite their proximity to the binding surface. In stark contrast, the remain-

192

ing glycan on Asn90 of ACE2 contacts the RBD with distinctly higher probabilities (P ≥ 70%),

193

for both MAN9 and FA2 species (Figures 4a,b and S2). Specifically, this Asn90 glycan frequently

194

forms contacts with residues of the RBD ranging approximately from 403–417 (Figures 4a-c). No-

195

tably, this RBD region does not form any contacts with ACE2 during simulation, regardless of

196

whether glycans were present or absent (Figure 2a-c). Since RBD-ACE2 contacts are independent

197

of the presence of glycans (as discussed earlier), this result indicates that contact formation be-

198

tween RBD and the Asn90 glycan of ACE2 does not compete with the protein-protein interactions

199

between RBD and ACE2.

200

The prominent role of the Asn90 glycan as elucidated by our long, unrestrained simulations

201

is consistent with previous atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements and steered molecular

202

dynamics (SMD) simulations (∼ 270 ns) [16]. In that study, AFM and SMD analyses suggest that

203

the Asn90 glycan can affect the association and disassociation of RBD and ACE2. As shown in

204

Figure 4, the frequent contacts between Asn90 glycan and RBD implies that there are significant

205

steric effects associated with this glycan. Since RBD-ACE2 interface interactions are not perturbed

206

by glycans (as discussed above), the sterics of Asn90 glycan would hinder the unbinding of RBD,

207

hence stabilizing the RBD-ACE2 complex. This result helps explain why, in AFM unbinding ex-

208

periments [16], separating RBD and ACE2 requires higher forces when ACE2 glycans are not

209

removed. For the case when ACE2 is not bound to RBD, the excluded volume of the Asn90 glycan

210

is likely to interfere with the binding interface, thereby impeding the association of RBD. Consis-

211

tent with this interpretation, mutation studies have shown that removal of the Asn90 glycan leads

212

to increased RBD binding events [17, 18]. Together, our simulations provide a mechanistic basis

213

for how the sterics of Asn90 glycan can impede the unbinding and binding of RBD.

214

In previous SMD simulations [16], which reported on glycan-RBD interactions, all glycans of

215

ACE2 were modeled as N-glycan core pentasaccharide, which is a minimum structure for all N-

216

glycans. Thus, the results from Ref. [16] may not apply to specific glycan types that have distinct

217

structures or chemical-physical properties. Here, we specifically included MAN9 or FA2 glycans

218

in ACE2 in our simulations and have shown that they are associated with comparable glycan-

219

RBD contact interactions (Figure 4a,b). While the contacts made with RBD may be similar for

220

MAN9 and FA2, different chemical-physical properties of the glycans can lead to distinct binding

221

energetics of the RBD-ACE2 complex, as will be discussed in a later section of this manuscript.

222

Interactions between Asn343 glycan of RBD and glycans of ACE2 may contribute to affinity

223

In addition to protein-protein and protein-glycan interactions, glycan-glycan interactions can

224

also be a contributor to RBD-ACE2 binding, and thus, infectivity. On the Spike RBD, we mod-

225

eled the glycan at Asn343 as a complex FA2 glycoform, in accordance with previous experimental

226

studies [9, 21]. In our simulations, the Asn343 glycan of RBD forms contacts with the Asn53 and

227

Asn322 glycans of ACE2 in 20% and 40% of the sampled configurations (regardless of ACE2

228

glycan type, see Figure S3), suggesting that these interactions may be a determinant of the stabil-

229

ity of the complex. Consistent with this notion, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus essays have shown that

230

removal of the RBD-Asn343 glycan leads to a 20-fold decrease in infectivity [11]. The functional

231

relevance of the RBD-Asn343 glycan may be reflected by the fact that this glycan is highly con-

232

served in current GISAID SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Specifically, it is lost in only 3 out of 313, 826

233

sequences, according to cov.lanl.gov Spike alignment (as of January 16, 2021). Interestingly, the

234

RBD-Asn343 glycan forms more frequent contacts only with the two glycans of ACE2 mentioned

235

above (i.e. the ones at Asn53 and Asn322), but does not form significant interactions with any pro-

236

tein residues of ACE2 (less than 10% contact probabilities, see Figure S3). This suggests that the

237

RBD-Asn343 glycan may contribute to infectivity, as implicated by [11], predominantly through

238

interactions with the Asn53 and Asn322 glycans of ACE2 (Figure S3).

239

RBD-ACE2 binding energetics depend on glycan type

240

To elucidate how the energetics of RBD-ACE2 binding may be affected by MAN9 or FA2

241

glycans, we applied the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) ap-

242

proach [22, 23]. We employ this end-state free-energy calculation to estimate the relative changes

243

in binding of RBD and ACE2, with and without glycans. In the present MM-PBSA calculations,

244

the binding energy of a ligand-receptor complex (RBD and ACE2) is approximated by changes in

245

molecular mechanics and solvation energies. Here, the sum of the two contributions is referred to

246

as MM-PBSA energy, which is composed of enthalpic terms and an approximation for the solvent

247

entropy (see SI Methods for details). To assess the free energy of binding (i.e. affinity), one needs

248

to further determine changes in conformational entropies. Separately from the MM-PBSA energy

249

calculation, the configurational entropy was estimated using a quasi-harmonic approach. We found

250

that the relative changes in entropy are similar for the MAN9 and FA2 simulations, and therefore,

251

did not include them in the binding energy calculations (see SI Methods and Figure S4a). Hence,

252

the MM-PBSA energies discussed below can be used to approximate relative changes in binding

253

energetics, allowing us to infer how each glycan type can influence RBD-ACE2 affinity.

254

To dissect the effect of different glycan types on RBD-ACE2 stability, we calculated MM-PBSA

255

energies (i.e. stability) for the simulations where glycans were not included, and where MAN9 or

256

FA2 glycans were bound to ACE2 (Figure 5a). For each simulation set, we used large numbers of

257

representative snapshots for MM-PBSA analysis to ensure statistical convergence (see SI Methods

258

for details). We find that the simulations with MAN9 glycans on ACE2 result in a 14.7% decrease

259

in RBD-ACE2 binding stability, relative to the simulations without glycans (Figure 5a). In con9

260

trast, the trajectories with FA2 glycans on ACE2 lead to a 9.1% increase. While this MM-PBSA

261

analysis does not report free energies, the distinct combinations of enthalpy and solvent entropy

262

demonstrate that RBD-ACE2 affinity can be dependent on glycan species. Specifically, since the

263

entropies associated with MAN9 and FA2 glycans are comparable (Figure S4a), our calculations

264

suggest that FA2 glycans in ACE2 would have a stabilizing effect on the RBD-ACE2 complex,

265

while the MAN9 type would lead to weaker binding affinity.

266

As shown earlier, of the six glycans that are on ACE2, only the one at Asn90 forms signif-

267

icant contacts with RBD, regardless of ACE2-glycan type (cf. Figures 4a,b and S2). Since only

268

glycan Asn90 forms close contacts with RBD, one could ask if the binding energy perturbations

269

(as presented in Figure 5a) resulted solely from the effects of glycan Asn90. To answer this, we

270

removed glycan Asn90 from both trajectories where either MAN9 or FA2 glycans were on ACE2,

271

and repeated the MM-PBSA analysis. When glycan Asn90 is excluded (Figure S4b), the MAN9

272

trajectory leads to a 9.6% decrease in RBD-ACE2 binding stability, relative to the simulations with-

273

out glycans (contrast this to the 14.7% decrease for when glycan Asn90 is present, cf. Figure 5a).

274

For the FA2 simulations, excluding glycan Asn90 results in an increase of 3.6% in stabilizing en-

275

ergy (versus the 9.1% increase for when glycan Asn90 is included, cf. Figure 5a). This comparison

276

demonstrates that while glycan Asn90 is a dominant contributor to the observed affinity pertur-

277

bations, it is not the sole contributor out of the six ACE2 glycans. Since the remaining glycans

278

on ACE2 lead to appreciable stability changes (Figure S4b) while not forming close contacts with

279

RBD (Figures 4a,b and S2), it suggests that glycans affect RBD-ACE2 affinity through long-range

280

electrostatic interactions, as discussed in more detail below.

281

Electrostatic effects of different glycan types lead to distinct RBD-ACE2 binding energetics

282

To identify which energetic contributions are responsible for the distinct affinities as shown

283

in Figure 5a, we dissected individual components of the MM-PBSA energy for the simulations

284

without glycans, and those with MAN9 or FA2 glycans in ACE2. Relative to the non-glycan simu-

285

lations, the ones with MAN9 or FA2 glycans in ACE2 each lead to a similar increase in stabilizing

286

van der Waals energetics of roughly 30% (Figure S4c). In terms of solvation energy (summation of

287

polar and nonpolar), the MAN9 and FA2 simulations are associated with greater stabilizing con-

288

tributions by 35% and 31%, compared to the non-glycan case. Regarding electrostatic energy, the

289

trajectories with MAN9 or FA2 glycans in ACE2 result in decrease of stabilizing contributions by

290

42% or 32%, relative to the value for non-glycan simulations. The summation of these energetic

291

components constitute the MM-PBSA results shown in Figure 5a. Our energy partitioning demon-

292

strates that electrostatic contributions, specific to each glycan type, are mainly responsible for the

293

observed variation in binding affinity of RBD-ACE2.

294

As just discussed above, electrostatic effects are the dominant factor for the observed difference

295

in MM-PBSA properties associated with MAN9 and FA2 glycans. Distinct electrostatic features

296

can stem from the charged sialic acids in FA2 and the characteristic solubility of each glycan

297

type. It has been suggested that the ACE2 binding surface is overall negatively charged, while the

298

corresponding RBD interface is positive [24]. Here, we further determined that ACE2 and RBD

299

surface-potential distributions are also mainly negative and positive, respectively, for regions well

300

beyond the binding interface (Figure 5b). Hence, interaction of the positive RBD with the negative

301

sialated tips of the FA2 glycans on ACE2 would lead to stabilizing MM-PBSA contributions, as

302

compared to MAN9 glycans that do not have these sialated tips. Since the RBD-ACE2 contact map

303

is independent of the presence of glycans, the observed MM-PBSA effects should be mainly the

304

result of long-range electrostatic interactions of the sugars that are flexible and sample wide re-

305

gions around the RBD. These findings are in agreement with numerous studies that have identified

306

sialic-acid interaction sites away from the binding interface, which may be critical for virus-host

307

binding [25, 26].

308

DISCUSSION

309

To develop effective strategies for treating COVID-19, one requires thorough insights into the

310

factors that determine the binding between viral RBD and human ACE2. To this end, recent struc-

311

tural analyses [5–7] and mutational experiments [3, 4] have alluded to possible RBD-ACE2 in-

312

teractions, as well as the role that glycans may play during this process. To extend these initial

313

findings, one must obtain a detailed mechanistic understanding of the dynamics associated with

314

numerous contributors to binding. For this purpose, we have performed long all-atom simulations

315

of the RBD-ACE2 complex in explicit solvent. To dissect each contributor, we simulated separate

316

models where different glycan types are bound or excluded (Figure 1). Interestingly, the simula-

317

tions show that MAN9 or FA2 glycans have virtually no effect on the interface contacts between
11

318

RBD and ACE2 (Figures 2a-c), nor the fluctuations of RBD relative to ACE2 (Figure 2d). Our sta-

319

tistical evaluation of contacts has identified which RBD-ACE2 interface residues are most likely

320

to form interactions, thereby pinpointing the critical sites for binding. This analysis is based on

321

the most extensive RBD-ACE2 simulations to date, comprising over 225 µs, which is one to two

322

orders of magnitude longer than previous simulations. Hence, our results represent more accurate

323

statistics that may be used as reference for interpreting experimental measurements, or gauging the

324

impact of specific mutations. As an example of application, we have used the simulations as guide

325

to evaluate how the novel N501Y mutation may modulate the affinity between virus and host (Fig-

326

ure 3). Specifically, our analysis suggests that N501Y leads to additional stabilizing interactions

327

(i.e. with Y41 and K353 of host ACE2, see Figure 3b) that can facilitate virus binding.

328

The present simulations suggest that excluded volume effects of the Asn90 glycan in receptor

329

ACE2 may determine the binding and unbinding of viral RBD (Figure 4). Precise characteriza-

330

tion of glycan structure and function in experiments has not been possible so far, because glycan

331

structures are highly complex, heterogeneous, and flexible [27, 28]. All currently available SARS-

332

CoV-2 Spike and human ACE2 structures only include glycans that are partially resolved (i.e. up to

333

the minimal stem conformation). Furthermore, these incomplete glycan structures represent only a

334

very limited conformational ensemble, since the flexible glycans can sample extremely large con-

335

formational spaces. Therefore, to accurately describe the effect of glycans, the simulations must

336

capture sufficiently large number of configurations. To account for this, we have generated 40 long

337

simulations with MAN9 or FA2 glycans, where each run was initiated using a distinctive starting

338

configuration (see Methods for details). The simulated trajectories have revealed that the glycan

339

on Asn90 of receptor ACE2 forms more significant contacts with viral RBD than any other ACE2

340

glycan. This suggests that steric effects from Asn90 glycan may impede the unbinding of RBD,

341

thus stabilizing the RBD-ACE2 complex. These results are consistent with recent atomic force

342

microscopy (AFM) experiments, where separating RBD and ACE2 requires higher forces when

343

the Asn90 glycan is present [16]. On the other hand, when ACE2 is not in complex with RBD, the

344

significant steric presence of Asn90 glycan indicates that it would obstruct the binding site, thereby

345

hindering the RBD from associating with ACE2. This notion agrees with mutational experiments

346

demonstrating that removal of the Asn90 glycan leads to increased RBD binding events [17, 18].

347

Here, by uncovering the prominent role of Asn90 glycan in forming contacts with RBD, our sim-

348

ulations indicate how Asn90-glycan sterics may impede the binding, as well as the unbinding of

349

RBD.

350

With increasing focus on the use of soluble extracellular domains of ACE2 as decoy inhibitors,

351

it is critical to understand how specific glycan types on ACE2 can affect the binding energetics of

352

RBD-ACE2. Our calculations suggest that distinct electrostatic features of different glycan types

353

can be decisive for binding affinity (Figure 5). Specifically, we have shown that stabilizing ener-

354

getics arise from interaction between the overall positively charged RBD and the negative sialated

355

tips of complex FA2 glycans on ACE2. These observations are in line with experiments that re-

356

ported stabilizing binding sites for sialic acids on Spike proteins in various SARS and MERS

357

strains [25, 29]. Sialation has also been known to improve thermal stability and solubility [30, 31],

358

as well as better recognition of “self” versus “non-self” by Siglecs [32], which are all favored

359

features for effective immunogens. Together, our simulations, along with these supporting experi-

360

ments, help establish how glycosylation variability on ACE2 can contribute to the slight discrep-

361

ancies in binding affinities of SARS-CoV-2 for host receptor [1, 5, 7, 33, 34], possibly explaining

362

the broad range of host-immune responses in the human population [35].

363

The present study elucidates the numerous contributors to the interplay between viral RBD and

364

human ACE2, including protein-protein interactions, and the effect of specific glycan types on

365

the binding of the RBD-ACE2 complex. The simulations have provided evidence that the stability

366

of RBD-ACE2 is dependent on which glycan type is bound to the host receptor. Remarkably,

367

ACE2 glycans can affect virus binding affinity through electrostatic effects, while not perturbing

368

the physical contacts that are formed between virus and host. Of the numerous glycans on ACE2,

369

the calculations have revealed that glycan Asn90 is a dominant contributor to affinity perturbations,

370

and may play a critical role in the binding and unbinding events of RBD. Together, our results

371

provide a theoretical framework that may be used to design more precise experiments that aim at

372

regulating the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.

373

METHODS

374

To elucidate the interaction between RBD and ACE2, we performed all-atom explicit-solvent

375

molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the RBD-ACE2 complex (PDB ID: 6M0J [5]; Figure 1a).

376

In all models used for simulations, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain is defined by residues T333–

377

G526, and the ACE2 receptor by S19–D615. To avoid artificial charges at the protein ends, we

378

introduced N-terminal acetylated and C-terminal N-methylamide capping groups. The ACE2 struc-

379

ture contains a zinc ion that is coordinated by H374, H378, E402, and one water molecule [5, 36].

380

Zinc coordination plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and stability of a pro-

381

tein [37]. To properly account for this in the simulations, we introduced bonded terms between

382

the zinc ion and H374, H378, E402 in ACE2. Equilibration values for distances and angles of

383

these bonded terms were defined by the values found in the RBD-ACE2 configuration of PDB ID:

384

6M0J [5]. The strength of the zinc interactions were set at values that are equivalent to covalent

385

bond interactions, as described in the CHARMM36m forcefield [38] applied for the present sim-

386

ulations. Note that we determined these force parameters for our previous simulations of C-Raf

387

CRD (unpublished data). In these C-Raf simulations, the parameters used here led to structural

388

fluctuations of the zinc site, whose scale at 310 K is consistent with the NMR ensemble from

389

Ref. [39].

390

To dissect the role of distinctive glycan species in the interaction of RBD and ACE2, we per-

391

formed additional separate sets of simulations where (a) MAN9 and FA2 glycans are attached to

392

ACE2 and RBD, respectively (Figure 1b, S1) and (b) FA2 glycans are on both ACE2 and RBD

393

(Figure 1c). Generally, glycans have complex structures and are highly flexible, allowing them to

394

sample very broad conformational spaces. Accordingly, simulations may not accurately capture

395

the effect of glycans if these calculations depend on the choice of initial configuration. To pre-

396

vent this artifact, we prepared 40 complementary initial configurations for the MAN9 and FA2

397

simulations (i.e. 20 for each simulation set). Each glycan initial structure was modeled based on

398

a simulated RBD-ACE2 configuration from preliminary trajectories (see SI Methods for details

399

on glycan modeling). By initiating the glycan simulations from many distinctive configurations,

400

we capture larger conformational ensembles that can more accurately partition the contribution of

401

each glycan type.

Simulation Details

403

All-atom explicit-solvent simulations were performed with the AMBER 16 software pack-

age [40]. The CHARMM36m forcefield [38] and TIP3P water model [41] were used. Each config-

405

uration was solvated and centered in a cubic box. The size of the cubic box was chosen to create

406

at least 15 Å padding on each side along the largest atom-atom distance of the molecule. Each

407

system was neutralized with an excess of 150 mM KCL. Energy minimization was performed us-

408

ing the steepest descent algorithm. Equilibration simulations were first carried out under the con-

409

stant number-volume-temperature (NVT) ensemble for 2 ns, and then under the constant number-

410

pressure-temperature (NPT) ensemble for 10 ns. During both equilibration stages, harmonic po-

411

sition restraints were imposed on all non-hydrogen atoms of the molecule. Constant temperature

412

was maintained at 310 K using velocity Langevin dynamics [42], with a relaxation time of 1 ps.

413

Constant isotropic pressure of 1 bar was achieved by employing the Berendsen barostat [43], with

414

a relaxation time of 4 ps and compressibility of 4.5 × 10−5 bar−1 . Covalent bond lengths were con-

415

strained with the SHAKE algorithm [44]. Van der Waals interactions were evaluated using a cutoff

416

where forces smoothly decay to zero between 1.0–1.2 nm. Coulomb interactions were computed

417

using the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method [45], with Fourier grid spacing of 0.08–0.10 nm

418

and fourth order interpolation. Unrestrained production simulations were performed in the NPT

419

ensemble, with an integration time step of 4 fs, which was enabled through hydrogen mass reparti-

420

tioning [46].

421

For the non-glycan RBD-ACE2 model (Figure 1a), 50 simulations were performed, with a to-

422

tal simulated time of 165 µs (i.e. each trajectory includes roughly 3.3 µs). For the complex with

423

MAN9 glycans in ACE2 (Figure 1b), 20 simulations were performed for an aggregated time of

424

over 30 µs (each replica of this set is about 1.5 µs long). Finally, the simulation set for the model

425

with FA2 glycans in ACE2 (Figure 1c) contains 20 simulations that exceed 30 µs of accumulated

426

time (each trajectory of this set is roughly 1.5 µs long).

role of glycans, we repeated this analysis for simulations that either include (b) MAN9 (cf. Figure 1b) or (c)

Dashed circle indicates the location of the N501Y mutation site in RBD, which is at the binding interface

residue N501 of RBD is shown in green, and the mutation N501Y in red. The simulations show that N501
forms persistent contacts with Y41 and K353 (cyan) of ACE2 (cf. Figure 2a). Based on this, we assess how
the N501Y mutation may alter the interactions with these ACE2 residues. As shown by dashed lines and
their labels, N501Y would introduce additional stabilizing interactions with Y41 and K353 of ACE2, which
will increase the binding affinity between RBD and ACE2.

probabilities (see region indicated by arrow). RBD residues that form these protein-glycan interactions are
roughly between 403–417. This RBD region does not form contacts with ACE2 in the non-glycan or glycanincluded simulations (cf. Figure 2a-c). This suggests that the glycans do not compete with protein-protein

SUPPORTING METHODS
Choice of glycosylation and glycan modeling

The ACE2 receptor has 7 potential N-glycosylation sites (PNGS), N53, N90, N103, N322,
N432, N546, and N690. Of these, the first six glycans are present in the ACE2 residue range used
in our simulations (i.e. S19–D615). It remains to be seen exactly how different glycan types at
these sites affect ACE2 association with the viral RBD. It is known that post-translational glycan modifications are strongly dependent on expression cell lines and their glycosylation enzyme
repertoire [1, 2]. Unfortunately, all currently available ACE2 studies were done using recombinant
proteins expressed in non-native cells. This prevents a definite determination of native glycosylation pattern on the ACE2 receptor and their role in RBD binding. Literature suggests that DC-SIGN
and L-SIGN lectins act as enhancer factors that facilitate ACE2 mediated virus infection [3]. These
specifically recognize high-mannose glycans [4], indicating that at least those glycans on ACE2
interacting with these lectins occur in oligomannose form. On the other hand, Zhao et al. [5] had
previously applied sequential exo-glycosidase digestion to identify mainly biantennary N- linked
glycans with sialylation and core fucosylation. Recently, Shajahan et al. [6] performed site specific
mass spectrometry analysis of human ACE2 to indicate predominantly complex type glycosylation,
with 60% biantennary, 85% fucosylated, and about half of them as sialated structures. Moreover,
negatively charged sialic acids extensively found on complex glycans have been reported to play
critical roles in viral Spike interaction [7]. A thorough understanding of the effects of glycosylation
is thus necessary.
Since each PNGS can have a varying distribution of glycan occupancies [6], we modeled two
divergent forms of N-glycans on the different ACE2 sites, namely the unprocessed 9-mannose
(MAN9) oligomer and the enzymatically processed fucosylated 2-antennae type complex glycan
(FA2) with commonly expected 2–3 linked [6] sialic acid tips. Since FA2 glycan type has been
shown to be the major glycoform at the Spike glycosylation site 343 [8, 9], this was selected as the
glycan choice for RBD for all glycan-included simulations. 40 initial configurations were modeled
for the MAN9 and FA2 simulations (i.e. 20 for each simulation set; cf. main text Figure 1b,c).
These initial configurations were prepared based on different RBD-ACE2 configurations taken
from preliminary glycan-free trajectories. Glycan structures were built at the PNGS, with random
orientations, using the ALLOSMOD package [10] of MODELLER [11]. This was succeeded by

short simulated annealing with the protein backbone restrained to relax the glycosylated systems
at different conformations, with the CHARMM36m forcefield [12], following the glycoprotein
modeling pipeline developed previously by our group [13, 14]. The CHARMM pdb and psf files
were converted to AMBER format using the CHAMBER command available in the PARMED
module of AMBERTOOLS 16 [15, 16]. Following the steps described, 20 different glycoprotein
configurations were obtained for each of the MAN9 and FA2 glycosylated ACE2 systems, which
were used for the 40 individual glycosylated trajectories of all-atom explicit-solvent simulations
performed with the AMBER 16 software [15].

MM-PBSA calculations

The binding energy between RBD and ACE2 was approximated using the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) method [17, 18]. To apply this method, we used
the MMPBSA.py script [19] within AMBERTOOLS 16. MM-PBSA estimates the binding energy
(∆Gbind ) from the molecular mechanical energy (∆EMM ), solvation free energy (∆Gsol ) and conformational entropy (∆S) as:
∆Gbind = ∆EMM + ∆Gsol − T ∆S
with
∆EMM = ∆Eint + ∆Evdw + ∆Eele
∆Gsol = ∆GPB + ∆GSA
T is the temperature; ∆Eint is the internal energy from the sum of bond, angle, and dihedral terms;
∆Evdw is the van der Waals energy; ∆Eele is the electrostatic energy; ∆GPB is the electrostatic solvation free energy computed by the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) method [20]; and ∆GSA is nonpolar
solvation free energy proportional to solvent accessible surface area and cavitation terms. ∆GSA
implicitly includes the solvent entropy approximation by virtue of parameterization [21, 22]. Because the PB calculations are computationally very costly, 4 sets of randomly selected 200 snapshots were used from the complete ensembles for these calculations in order to obtain robust sampling and standard errors.

MM-PBSA has been shown to perform reasonably well for protein-glycan systems in order to
calculate relative affinity changes and their agreement with experimental values [23]. The conformational entropy change (∆S) is not included in the present MM-PBSA analysis since entropy
calculations are typically error-prone [24, 25] and have convergence difficulties [26, 27]. It has been
shown that the inclusion of entropic terms from quasi-harmonic approximation provided no meaningful improvement in the agreement between the predicted and experimental energies, whereas
other methods of conformational entropy calculations such as harmonic approximation entropies
reduced the correlation [23]. Here, the quasi-harmonic conformational entropy was calculated from
the eigenvectors of complete covariance matrix in GROMACS v5.1.2 [28] (Figure S4a). Since the
relative changes in conformational entropy are similar between the MAN9 and FA2 simulations
(Figure S4a), we did not included them in our binding energy calculations. Electrostatic potential
calculation was performed using the Adaptive Poisson Boltzmann Solver [29].
