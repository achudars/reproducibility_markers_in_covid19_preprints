Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative pathogen of the
COVID-19 pandemic which as of Nov 15, 2020 has claimed 1,319,946 lives worldwide.
Vaccine development focuses on the viral trimeric spike glycoprotein as the main
target of the humoral immune response. Viral spikes carry glycans that facilitate
immune evasion by shielding specific protein epitopes from antibody neutralisation.
Immunogen integrity is therefore important for glycoprotein-based vaccine candidates.
Here we show how site-specific glycosylation differs between virus-derived spikes and
spike proteins derived from a viral vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. We show
that their distinctive cellular secretion pathways result in different protein glycosylation
and secretion patterns, which may have implications for the resulting immune
response and future vaccine design.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent
of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can induce fever, severe respiratory illness,
and various multi-organ disease manifestations [1]. The virus enters host cells by
binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) using its extensively glycosylated
spike (S) protein [2], [3]. The S glycoprotein is a class I fusion protein, comprising two
functional subunits. The S1 subunit is responsible for ACE2 receptor binding and the
S2 subunit initiates membrane fusion between the virus particle and host cell. S protein
synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of an infected cell is accompanied by cotranslational addition of pre-assembled N-glycans to its 22 N-glycosylation sites [4].
After trimerisation and initial N-glycan processing in the ER by ER resident sugar
modifying enzymes, S proteins travel as membrane anchored trimers to the ER-Golgi
intermediate compartment (ERGIC) where they are incorporated into the membranes
of viruses budding into the ERGIC lumen [5], [6]. S trimers protrude from the viral
surface while individual viruses move along inside the lumina of cis-, medial- and
trans-Golgi, where their N-glycans are extensively processed and further modified
further by Golgi resident glycosylation enzymes. O-glycans are also added in the
Golgi, starting with the addition of GalNAc residues via GalNAc transferase, which can
be elongated similarly to N-glycans across the Golgi stack. In the trans-Golgi, S trimers
encounter the host protease furin which cleaves between S1 and S2 [7], [8], leaving
the subunits on S trimers non-covalently associated before the virus is secreted via
lysosomes into the extracellular surrounding [9].
Host-derived glycosylation plays many important roles in viral pathobiology, including
mediating viral protein folding and stability, as well as influencing viral tropism and
immune evasion [10].The trimeric spikes protruding from viruses are key targets of the
natural immune response [11]. Neutralising antibodies binding to these spikes,
especially to S1, prevent cellular uptake of viruses by the host. Consequently, most
vaccine design efforts focus on the S protein. The surface of each trimeric spike
displays up to 66 N-linked glycans and an undefined number of O-linked glycans [12].
Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 exploits glycosylation on native S proteins will help
guide rational vaccine design, as glycans enable immune evasion by shielding
underlying immunogenic protein epitopes from antibody neutralisation, as also
observed for other coronaviruses [13], [14]. In other instances, glycans constitute
functional epitopes in immune recognition [15], further highlighting the need for
molecular mimicry between viruses and vaccines that are designed to prime the
immune system by eliciting neutralising antibodies.
Importantly, several COVID-19 vaccine candidates are based on viral vectors
encoding SARS-CoV-2 S protein, including ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222; Folegatti
et al., 2020; van Doremalen et al., 2020). To compare virus-derived S protein
glycosylation with that of a viral vector vaccine candidate, we grew SARS-CoV-2
(England/02/2020 strain) in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, harvested the virus containing
supernatant, and immunopurified detergent-solubilised spike using a CR3022

antibody column (Figure 1A). Immunopurified material was analysed by SDS-PAGE
(Figure 1B) and the protein bands corresponding to S1 (S1virus) and S2 were excised
from the gel and confirmed by mass spectrometry (Supplementary Figure 1A). S2
levels were in insufficient amounts for additional glycan/glycoproteomics analysis.
Quantitative analysis of S1virus released N-glycans by UPLC (Figure 1C) showed a
predominant population of complex-type N-glycans (79%) with 21% oligomannose
and/or hybrid structures. Comparing these values to a soluble recombinant trimeric
form of S (Srecombinant trimer), which has been engineered to abolish furin cleavage and
therefore also contains S2 N-glycans [18], revealed Srecombinant trimer to carry only 11%
oligomannose/hybrid and 89% complex N-glycans (Figure 1D). This observation is
significant as it indicates large-scale differences in glycan processing, a complex
pathway that is influenced by high glycan density and local protein architecture, both
of which can sterically impair glycan maturation (Figure 1E). Changes in glycan
maturation, resulting in the presence of oligomannose-type glycans, can be a sensitive
reporter of native-like protein architecture [19], [20], and is also an important indicator
for quality control and efficacy of different immunogens [21].
To pinpoint where, and the extent to which, differences in glycan processing occur, we
performed a quantitative site-specific N- and O-glycosylation analysis of S1virus (Figure
1F) and Srecombinant trimer (Supplementary Figure 2) by mass spectrometry. We
detected glycopeptides for all 13 potential N-glycosylation sites in S1 and importantly,
we found that S1 N-glycan processing is comparable between virus and recombinant
material, excluding the possibility that differences in glycan processing observed by
UPLC are outweighed by the presence of the S2 subunit on Srecombinant trimer. Looking
closer at S1virus, we observed three N-glycan sites, N61, N234 and N603, that are
predominantly occupied by underprocessed oligomannose structures and are likely
shielded by the quaternary protein structure. This is in contrast to previously reported
N-glycan analysis on virus derived S, where N61 carried mostly complex-type (with
some oligomannose) glycans; N234 was a mixture of oligomannose, hybrid and
complex structures and N603 was mostly complex [22]. We found that the remaining
sites on S1virus were either occupied almost entirely by tri-antennary N-glycans (N149
and N165), or by a mixture of tri-antennary complex plus oligomannose (namely
Man5GlcNAc2, i.e. M5) structures. We did not detect any O-linked glycosylation at
T232/S325 on Srecombinant trimer, an observation that is variably reported among
recombinant S or S1 material [22]–[25]. However, we identified O-glycosylation at
T678 on S1virus, which was absent on Srecombinant trimer. This is particularly informative,
indicating this domain on S1 virus is more accessible to GalNAc-transferases in the
Golgi and that the viral spike is possibly configured in a more open or flexible trimeric
state than the recombinant, stabilised spike. We also observed the presence of SARSCoV-2 nucleoprotein and SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein at lower levels in the
immunopurified material (Supplementary Table 1).
With the aim of comparing site-specific S glycosylation in the context of vaccine design
and antigen structure, we produced S in mammalian cells using an expression

construct identical to the one used in creating ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [16]. This contains
SARS-CoV-2 amino acids 2-1273 preceded by an N-terminal leader peptide consisting
of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and a modified human cytomegalovirus major
immediate early promoter. Using the same purification strategy as above, we observed
that the majority of over-expressed protein was secreted into the supernatant as
soluble S1 (herein referred to as S1vaccine antigen), as detected by SDS-PAGE (Figure
2A) and confirmed by mass spectrometry (Supplementary Figure 1B). S2 remained
cell associated, embedded in the lipid bilayer, as shown by western blot probed with
an antibody against S2 (Supplementary Figure 3). We analysed the secreted
S1vaccine antigen by mass photometry, and compared it to the stabilised Srecombinant trimer,
which revealed the shed vaccine antigen to be solely monomeric (Figure 2B,
Supplementary Movies 1 and 2).
Glycan content analysis of S1vaccine antigen demonstrated an extraordinary 96% of
complex N-glycans and only 4% of oligomannose-type N-glycans (Figure 2C),
indicating an increase in accessibility of glycan processing enzymes in the Golgi to
S1vaccine antigen glycan sites compared to S1virus. Quantitative site-specific N- and Oglycosylation analysis of S1vaccine antigen confirmed that although overall N-glycan site
occupancy was comparable to S1virus, except for N17, which was 47% nonglycosylated; the large majority of N-glycans attached to S1vaccine antigen underwent
considerably more processing, likely after furin cleavage in the Golgi, as evidenced by
the presence of increased complex glycosylation. The N61 and N603 sites, which were
98% and 83% oligomannose on S1virus, became 12% and 18% on S1vaccine antigen,
respectively. We also detected an increase in T323/S325 and T678 O-glycan
extensions (i.e. presence of core-2 structures) as well as a 50% increase in sialylation
at T678. Finally, N-glycan sites that had mixed oligomannose and complex glycan
populations on S1virus (N74, N122, N343 and N616) become heavily processed on
S1vaccine antigen (Figure 1F and Figure 2D for S1virus and S1vaccine antigen, respectively).
However, a single N-glycan site is maintained in an underprocessed state. For S1virus,
60% of the N-glycans at position N234 were Man6-8GlcNAc2 (M6, M7 and M8)
structures. In contrast, although the S1vaccine antigen carried the slightly more processed
M5 N-glycan, which is not accessible to GlcNAc-transferase I in the cis-Golgi, the
remaining structures did not progress to more complex type glycosylation like the rest.
This prevention of more extensive glycan processing of the N-glycan at N234 is due
to the spatial and temporal assembly of S proteins in the ER and Golgi. On a fully
assembled S trimer, N234 glycans are located in a pocket formed partly by the
receptor binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) on the same
protomer, and partly by a neighbouring RBD, which gives rise to the largely
underprocessed oligomannose structures when early N-glycan trimming at this site is
prevented by trimerisation of S in the ER (Figure 3A). In both recombinant trimerderived and viral S1, N234 was 100% oligomannose, but dropped to 74.8%
oligomannose on vaccine-derived S1 (Figure 3B). The fact that this site was also
underprocessed on S1vaccine antigen indicates that this protein is derived from a spike that

initially trimerised in the ER, but that this trimer is apparently less “closed” and more
accessible to mannose-trimming ER enzymes compared to its counterpart expressed
by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
This slightly less closed vaccine trimer travels in a membrane-bound form from the ER
to the ERGIC, but as there are no viruses present to incorporate these trimers into
their envelopes when budding into the ERGIC lumen, the overexpression system
causes the Svaccine antigen trimers to be pushed further along the membranes of the cis, medial- and trans-Golgi. We detected mannose-6-phosphate (M-6-P) on S1vaccine
antigen (Figure 2D, Supplementary Figure 4), with some evidence for this modification
also on S1virus (Supplementary Figure 5). This sugar tag is initially added in the cisGolgi in the form of GlcNAc-M-6-P, then decapped in the trans-Golgi and recognised
by the M-6-P receptor responsible for directing tagged proteins and possibly whole
viruses from the trans-Golgi to late endosomes/lysosomes; such lysosomal egress
has recently been described for SARS-CoV-2 virus [9]. With the furin cleavage site
intact, Svaccine antigen is cleaved by furin in the trans-Golgi. However, unlike endogenous
viral spikes, where we postulate that additional stabilising viral factors are present,
S1vaccine antigen dissociates from S2vaccine antigen upon furin cleavage and becomes
secreted. This shedding occurs in the trans-Golgi rather than at the plasma membrane
of the cell, as evidenced by the increased N-glycan processing by late-stage Golgi
glycosylation enzymes, resulting in the high complex-type N-glycan content of S1vaccine
antigen, and also by the substantially increased O-glycosylation occupancy levels on
T678 (Figure 3D, Supplementary Figure 6). Plausibly, the modest amount of S1virus
T678 O-glycosylation is related to furin cleavage, making S1virus more accessible to OGalNAc-transferases; however, differences in virus assembly and the continuous
association with, and shielding by, S2virus prevents this from reaching similar O-glycan
occupancy levels as that of cleaved soluble S1vaccine antigen (Figure 3D). Although
Srecombinant trimer transits the trans-Golgi in soluble form, it is not O-glycosylated at this
position as it lacks the furin site (R682-R685, Figure 3C), cleavage of which appears
to favour this processing step.
To test our hypothesis that S1vaccine antigen comes from an assembled S trimer and is
shed in the trans-Golgi following furin cleavage, we expressed the individual
S1recombinant subunit (Supplementary Figures 7), that cannot trimerise, and quantified
the extent of N-glycan processing at N234 and O-glycosylation at T678. S1recombinant
had 100% complex-type glycans at N234, shifting from 25.3% complex for S1vaccine
antigen and 0% for Srecombinant trimer and S1virus (Figure 3B). Similarly, T678 O-glycan
occupancy was reversed from 0% (Srecombinant trimer), 22.7% (S1virus), 89.5% (S1vaccine
antigen) to 100% (S1recombinant) (Figure 3D). The site-specific changes across all S1
samples are illustrated in Supplementary Figure 8). However, cleavage of Svaccine
antigen by furin is not complete; around 10% was not O-glycosylated and appeared on
the cell surface, which would not happen during natural virus infection. This was shown
by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis using staining with the RDBspecific CR3022 antibody of either unpermeabilised or detergent-permeabilised cells

(Figures 3E & 3F). It may be this potentially trimerised and still S1-containing cell
surface accessible spike that gives rise to the promising antibody responses reported
in an early phase ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 clinical trial [16], [17].
These results are encouraging, showing that it may be possible to improve on
immunogen design. Shedding of monomeric and non-physiologically glycosylated
S1vaccine antigen from immunogen producing cells is reminiscent of HIV vaccine
development, where early immunogens were hampered by the inability of monomeric
gp120 to elicit a broadly neutralising antibody response, which is needed for virus
neutralisation [26]. Indeed, immunogens that do not mimic trimeric spike glycoproteins
as they are presented on infectious virions may effectively act as a decoy, eliciting
more of the unwanted sub-optimal or non-neutralising antibodies that are incapable of
binding to and neutralising trimeric spikes on the virus [15], [26]–[29]. For SARS-CoV2, most neutralising antibodies bind to the trimer apex (Supplementary Table 2), and
those will not be elicited by shed S1vaccine antigen which lacks both the correct protein
architecture and exposes non-neutralising epitopes that would otherwise be buried on
assembled spikes. For example, S2M11 [30] (Supplementary Figure 9A) and C144
[31] bind on a quaternary epitope formed by two neighbouring RBDs on the trimer
apex. The binding of neutralising antibodies that incorporate N-glycans as part of their
binding epitopes, e.g. S309 [32] (Supplementary Figure 9B) and BD-23 [33] , will
also be adversely affected by a vaccine antigen that differs from circulating viruses in
a natural infection. Furthermore, specific glycans, including N234, affect the up/down
orientation of the RBD domain [12] pointing to the critical need for physiological
glycosylation on effective vaccines based on S1. Yet other neutralising antibodies
could bind to peptide epitopes of S1 that may still be available on shed S1vaccine antigen
but that may be less accessible because of the non-physiologically high amount of
complex N-glycans shielding those epitopes.
A strong B-cell response is based on the immunogen mimicking parts of an invading
pathogen. Therefore, for SARS-CoV-2 we suggest that a stabilised trimeric pre-fusion
spike protein, with the furin cleavage site abolished, and with non-physiological areas
shielded to prevent unwanted non-neutralising immune response, may be able to elicit
neutralising antibodies with the desirable significant breadth and potency. Viral vectorbased, such as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, as well as nucleic acid-based vaccine strategies,
such as the Pfizer BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccines, rely on the supplied
antigen-encoding DNA or RNA sequence, once inside a cell, to faithfully produce the
spike protein in its fully folded, glycosylated and assembled state, resembling a natural
infection and trigger a robust innate immune response, as well as provoking T and B
cells. However, the cellular secretion pathway followed by such vaccine delivered
antigens may differ in fundamental ways from antigens in the context of viral infection,
where factors other than a single protein coding sequence may play decisive roles in
immunogen presentation (Figure 4). These include the (intra)cellular location of viral
morphogenesis (i.e. from which organelle a virus buds), as well as the overall shape
in which an immunogen encounters the host cellular glycosylation machinery during a

natural infection. The Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine antigen aims to overcome some of
these important differences by following a strategy first employed for MERS, as well
as SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein stabilisation for vaccine design [34], [35], where two
proline mutations are introduced in close proximity to the first heptad repeat of each
protomer, which stabilises the prefusion conformation [36].
Abolishing the furin cleavage site and introducing mutations that lock the spike protein
in the prefusion conformation and prevent shedding of S1 are likely to elicit more
potent antibody responses. Some vaccine candidates already combine both
approaches [37], [38] and it would be interesting to compare their glycan signatures to
that of wild-type virus. Characterising and understanding the correct glycosylation of
the virus will be crucial in the development of a high-quality immune response, and
glycan processing may inform vaccine design strategies, aimed at achieving the
correct immunogen presentation, for this and future pandemics.

Figure 4: Differential expression and glycan processing of virions and vaccine
derived spike glycoproteins. SARS-CoV-2 binds to its receptor ACE-2 and infects
cells, leading to the release of the viral genome and translation of viral proteins. Spike
protein is co-translationally N-glycosylated and forms trimers in the ER that traffic to
the ERGIC where they are incorporated into budding virions. Individual virions
continue through the secretory pathway to the trans-Golgi prior to following a
lysosomal egress route. For the vaccine candidate, spike DNA is administered via an
adenovirus vector system, and spike protein is synthesized in the ER, where it is Nglycosylated and trimerises as before, but as it is not incorporated into a budding virion
in the ERGIC, it continues through the secretory pathway and, via lysosomes, to the
plasma membrane. In both cases the spike glycoproteins have access to both the Nand O- linked host glycosylation machinery. Upon furin cleavage in the trans-Golgi, S1
and S2 of the virus stay non-covalently associated, whereas furin cleavage of the
vaccine antigen results in shedding of monomeric S1vaccine antigen. Glycomic signature
analysis of these two proteins show that the N-linked glycosylation occupancy levels,
which are determined in the ER, are comparable for S1virus and S1vaccine antigen whereas
the attached glycoforms vary reflecting their different accessibility to glycan processing
enzymes. S1vaccine antigen carries not only higher levels of complex N-glycans but is also
extensively O-glycosylated after furin cleavage in the trans-Golgi, when most S1vaccine
antigen is shed and secreted in a soluble monomeric form. Some S1 and S2vaccine antigen
is displayed on the cell surface, presumably as trimers.
