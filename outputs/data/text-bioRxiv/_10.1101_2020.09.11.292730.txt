Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel
coronavirus spreading across the world causing the disease COVID-19. The diagnosis of
COVID-19 is done by quantitative reverse-transcription polymer chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) testing which utilizes different primer-probe sets depending on the assay
used. Using in silico analysis we aimed to determine how the secondary structure of the
SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome affects the interaction between the reverse primer during
qRT-PCR and how it relates to the experimental primer-probe test efficiencies. We
introduce the program DinoKnot (Duplex Interaction of Nucleic acids with
pseudoKnots) that follows the hierarchical folding hypothesis to predict the secondary
structure of two interacting nucleic acid strands (DNA/RNA) of similar or different
type. DinoKnot is the first program that utilizes stable stems in both strands as a guide
to find the structure of their interaction. Using DinoKnot we predicted the interaction
of the reverse primers used in four common COVID-19 qRT-PCR tests with the
SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In addition, we predicted how 12 mutations in the
primer/probe binding region may affect the primer/probe ability and subsequent
SARS-CoV-2 detection. While we found all reverse primers are capable of interacting
with their target area, we identified partial mismatching between the SARS-CoV-2
genome and some reverse primers. We predicted three mutations that may prevent
primer binding, reducing the ability for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We believe our
contributions can aid in the design of a more sensitive SARS-CoV-2 test.

Author summary
The current testing for the disease COVID-19 that is caused by the novel cornonavirus
SARS-CoV-2 uses oligonucleotides called primers that bind to specific target regions on
the SARS-CoV-2 genome to detect the virus. Our goal was to use computational tools
to predict how the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome affects the ability of the
primers to bind to their target region. We introduce the program DinoKnot (Duplex
interaction of nucleic acids with pseudoknots) that is able to predict the interactions
between two DNA or RNA molecules. We used DinoKnot to predict the efficiency of
four common COVID-19 tests, and the effect of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus on
ability of the COVID-19 tests in detecting those strains. We predict partial
mismatching between some primers and the SARS-CoV-2 genome but that all primers
are capable of interacting with their target areas. We also predict three mutations that
prevent primer binding and thus SARS-CoV-2 detection. We discuss the limitations of
the current COVID-19 testing and suggest the design of a more sensitive COVID-19 test
that can be aided by our findings.

Introduction

1

SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory disease spreading across the world that originated in
Wuhan, China in 2019 [1]. SARS-CoV-2 is most commonly detected using qRT-PCR on
samples collected by nasopharyngeal swabs [2]. During qRT-PCR, the reverse primer
first binds to the positive sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome so that the reverse
transcriptase (RT) can use the primer to generate the complementary DNA (cDNA) of
the negative sense strand as shown in Fig 1 [3].
The primer-probe set used to detect SARS-CoV-2 depends on which qRT-PCR assay
is used. The China Center for Disease Control (China CDC), United States CDC (US
CDC), Charité Institute of Virology, Universitätsmedizin Berlin (Charité), and Hong
Kong University (HKU) have developed the most common assays to detect
SARS-CoV-2 that all target different areas of the SARS-CoV-2 genome [4]. In a recent
publication, Vogels et al. compared the analytical efficiencies and sensitivities of the
primer-probe sets used in these assays [4].
By studying how the reverse primer interacts with the RNA genome, we can predict
if the generation of the initial cDNA template from the RNA strand proceeds as
expected during the qRT-PCR test. We do not investigate the interaction of the
forward primer and the probes with the SARS-CoV-2 genome because the important
interactions of these oligonucleotides are involved in binding to the cDNA, not the
positive sense RNA genome.

Fig 1. Interaction of the primers to the RNA/cDNA strands during
qRT-PCR amplification. The reverse primer first binds to the target
complementary sequence on the SARS-CoV-2 positive (+ve) sense RNA genome. The
reverse transcriptase then generates the negative (-ve) sense complementary DNA
(cDNA) strand. The forward primer then binds to the negative sense cDNA strand and
the DNA polymerase generates the positive sense cDNA strand. The reverse primer
binds to the complementary target sequence on the positive sense cDNA and the DNA
polymerase generates a new negative sense cDNA strand. [3]. This process repeats for
strand amplification during qRT-PCR.
We aimed to determine whether the RNA structure of the SARS-CoV-2 genome
affects the binding of the reverse primers in the qRT-PCR assay and whether this
correlated to the analytical efficiencies and sensitivities shown by Vogels et al. [4]. To
study the structure of such interactions, we developed DinoKnot, a program that given
two nucleic acid strands predicts their interaction structure. We used DinoKnot to
predict how the RNA structure of SARS-CoV-2 changes when the reverse primer binds
to the RNA genome and whether the primer was binding in the location that was
expected. We further predicted how mutations in the primer/probe binding region of
the SARS-CoV-2 genome provided by Vogels et al. could affect the primer/probe
sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection [4].
First, we introduce DinoKnot and our experiment set up. We then present the
interaction structures predicted by DinoKnot. We discuss the interactions and which
mutations may decrease SARS-CoV-2 detection during qRT-PCR testing. Finally, we
suggest the design of a more sensitive COVID-19 test and future work that can be done
using DinoKnot.

cDNA transcript) can be structured. Their structures can change upon interaction with
one another to accommodate formation of more stable base pairings. Existing tools that
predict structure of interaction in two molecules mostly focus on similar strands (i.e.
DNA/DNA or RNA/RNA) [5–10], and merely focus on the interaction site (i.e.
ignoring the intramolecular structures) [11–15]. Our DinoKnot (Duplex Interaction of
Nucleic acids with pseudoKnots) aims to address both such shortcomings.
In this section we first provide an overview of the problem of secondary structure
prediction for two interacting molecules. We then introduce DinoKnot, and explain how
it overcomes the shortcomings of the existing methods on prediction of the secondary
structure for two different types of nucleic acid strands. Finally we provide details of
our in silico system and experiment setup.

An RNA is a single stranded molecule with two distinct ends, namely 5’ and 3’, that
folds back onto itself by forming intramolecular base pairs. An RNA molecule is
represented by a sequence, S, of its four bases, Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G)
and Uracil (U) arranged on a line (representing the backbone) from 5’ (left) to 3’ (right)
ends. The length of the RNA molecule is denoted by n and each base of the RNA
sequence is referred to by its index i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Complementary bases bind and form
base pairs (A.U , C.G, and G.U ). Here “.” represents a pairing of the two bases. A
secondary structure, R, is then defined as a set of base pairs i.j , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n; i.j and
k.j can belong to the same set if and only if i = k i.e. each base may pair at most with
one other base. If i.j and k.l are two base pairs of a secondary structure, R, such that
1 ≤ i < k < j < l ≤ n, then i.j crosses k.l. A pseudoknotted secondary structure refers
to a structure with crossing base pairs. A pseudoknot-free secondary structure refers to
a structure without crossing base pairs. The RNA structure forms because it is
energetically favourable for bases to form paired helices. Different base pairing patterns
in a secondary structure define different loop types. We note that the principles of
structure prediction are essentially the same for single stranded DNAs. Computational
secondary structure prediction from the base sequence is often done by finding the
energetically most stable (minimum free energy) secondary structure, when each loop is
assigned an energy value. These energy values are kept in various tables and are known
as energy parameters. Some parameter sets have been derived directly from
experiments, and others are extrapolated based on experimentally determined values.
Energy parameters are strand type specific, i.e. similar loops in an RNA molecule have
different assigned energy than the ones in a DNA molecule. Existing minimum free
energy (MFE) structure prediction methods find the minimum free structure for a given
sequence from the pool of all possible structures. Methods for MFE pseudoknot-free
structure prediction use dynamic programming method to find the MFE
structure [16, 17]. Since prediction of the MFE pseudoknotted structure is
NP-hard [18, 19] and even inapproximable [20], methods for pseudoknotted MFE
structure prediction focus on a restricted class of structures [21–25].
We can represent the interacting secondary structure of two nucleic acid sequences
similarly, by concatenating the two strands together and keeping track of the gap
between the two strands with a dummy linker. When two strands are of similar type,
the energy calculation of the concatenated sequence will be similar to that of a single
strand of the same type, except for loops containing the gapped region (as they are not
true loops when sequences are not concatenated). When two strands of different types
interact (i.e a DNA strand binding to an RNA strand) the situation is more
complicated as there is currently no energy parameters available for loops formed
between the two strands.

DinoKnot

89

DinoKnot follows the relaxed hierarchical folding hypothesis [26] for prediction of the
minimum free energy structure of two interacting nucleic acid strands. Following this
hypothesis an RNA molecule first forms simple pseudoknot-free base pairs before
forming more complex and possibly pseudoknotted structures [27]. During this process
some of the originally formed base pairs may open up to accommodate more stable
pairings. Existing methods based on hierarchical folding, namely HFold [24] and
Iterative HFold [26], focus on single RNA structure prediction [24, 26]. Our DinoKnot is
to the best of our knowledge the first program that follows the hierarchical folding
hypothesis for prediction of pseudoknotted structure of two interacting nucleic acid
molecules. Similar to HFold and Iterative HFold, DinoKnot handles a large class of
pseudoknotted structures called density-2 structures [24]. This class of structures
include a wide range of commonly found pseudoknotted structures including H-type
pseudoknots and kissing hairpins with arbitrary nested substructures.
DinoKnot, takes a pair of nucleic acid sequences as input and returns their
interaction structure with its corresponding free energy value. Each sequence can be of
type RNA or DNA. We note that the minimum free energy structure of two input
strands may not involve any interaction if it is energetically more favourable for each
sequence to form intramolecular base pairs.
The user can optionally provide a pseudoknot-free input structure if such
information is available to guide the prediction. If no input structure is provided by the
user, DinoKnot will generate up to 20 pseudoknot-free secondary structures (i.e.
energetically favourable stems) by default for each strand (to the total of up to 400
stems for two strands). Guided by these energetically favourable stems, DinoKnot finds
multiple structures (sorted by their free energy) for the interacting structures. The
output structure (in dot-bracket format) is the minimum free energy structure among
this set of structures.
DinoKnot employs the energy parameters of Andronescu et al. HotKnots V2.0 [28]
for RNA structures and MultiRNAFold energy parameters [6] for DNA structures. We
have estimated the energy parameters for loops formed between an RNA and a DNA
molecule to be the average of similar loops formed intramolecularly in an RNA and a
DNA molecule.
All source code and energy parameters are available in our Github page.

The SARS-CoV-2 reference genome NC 045512.2 was obtained from the National
Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database [29]. The sequence of the
RNA transcripts used by Vogels et al. [4] to determine the primer efficiency were input
into the programs Iterative HFold [26] to predict their secondary structure. This output
is the secondary structure of the transcript prior to the interaction with the reverse
primer. The primer sequences were obtained from the list of World Health Organization
(WHO) protocols to diagnose COVID-19 [30]. The locations where the primers bind on
the reference genome NC 045512.2 and the corresponding RNA transcript area are
stated in Table 1.
qRT-PCR involves the use of forward and reverse primers, a probe, reverse
transcriptase (RT) and DNA polymerase. Forward and reverse primers are DNA
oligonucleotides that bind to complementary sequences in order to amplify a section of
the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The reverse primer is a DNA oligonucleotide that interacts
with both the positive sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and the positive sense cDNA
transcript as shown in Fig 1. Therefore the reverse primer is involved in both
RNA/DNA and DNA/DNA interactions. The forward primer is a DNA oligonucleotide

interacts with the negative sense cDNA transcript. The probe is a fluorescent-labelled
DNA oligonucleotide that may bind to either the positive or negative sense cDNA
transcript, depending on how it is designed. Therefore, the forward primer and probe
are only involved in DNA/DNA interactions. RT is an enzyme that uses an RNA as a
template to generate a complementary DNA strand. DNA polymerase is an enzyme
that uses a DNA template to generate a complementary DNA strand.
DinoKnot was used with the RNA transcript region and the reverse primer to
determine the location where the reverse primer binds and the secondary interaction
structure. Two of the reverse primers, HKU-ORF1-R and RdRp-SARS-R, contain
degenerate bases which means there are a mixture of oligonucleotides that contain
different bases at the degenerate base position [31]. In these cases, all possible
degenerate base combinations were predicted with DinoKnot. The dot-bracket output
was visualized using VARNA [32] in arc format in which RNA backbone is represented
by a horizontal line and base pairs are presented as arcs that connect the two bases.

Vogels et al. listed mutations in the primer/probe binding area of the SARS-CoV-2
genome that occur at a frequency of greater than 0.1% [4]. To predict if these mutations
affect primer/probe binding, and thus the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection, the
mutated sequence of the transcript along with the affected primer/probe was entered
into DinoKnot. The RNA/DNA setting was used to predict the interaction between the
mutated RNA transcript and the reverse primer. The DNA/DNA setting in DinoKnot
was used to predict the interaction structure between the mutated cDNA transcript and
the corresponding primer/probe. The dot-bracket output was visualized using
VARNA [32] in arc format in which RNA backbone is visualized by a horizontal line
and base pairs are represented by arcs connecting bases of the backbone.

DinoKnot predicted the interaction structures represented in Fig 2 to occur between the

region of the reverse primer is highlighted in green and the reverse primer sequence is

were input into DinoKnot to produce the output interaction structures. The
E-Sarbeco-R* and HKU-N-R* primer structures were input into DinoKnot as unfolded
to simulate the primer structure during the 95◦ C denaturation step of the qRT-PCR
assay due to primer mismatch prediction under default conditions of 37◦ C.

All of the reverse primers were predicted by DinoKnot to interact with their

The HKU-ORF1-R and the 2019-nCoV N2-R primer were predicted to pair to their
target with single base mismatches. The HKU-ORF1-R primer contains the degenerate
base R which means the the primer may contain an A or a G at this position. The
target base is a U in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The interaction structure was predicted
twice, both with an A and G in the position of degenerate base R. The output produced
the expected match, except when the primer was set as a G, the G/U base pair did not
bind but it did not affect the rest of the primer area from binding to the target area.
The last base at the 3’ end of the 2019-nCoV N2-R primer did not pair with any
nucleotide but the rest of the primer was predicted to bind to its expected target region.
Although these primers contain a single predicted mismatch, the analytical efficiencies
and sensitivities of these primer probe sets were comparable to the other primer-probes
tested experimentally [4].

The HKU-N-R and E-Sarbeco-R primers did not pair as expected to their target region
when DinoKnot was not given an input structure (i.e. when both strands were free to
assume possible structures before interacting with one another). The HKU-N-R primer
was predicted to bind to itself, rather than its target region. When the HKU-N-R
primer structure was forced to be unfolded, the first base of the HKU-N-R primer at the
5’ end did not bind to its expected nucleotide but the rest of the primer interacted with
the target region as expected. Forcing the primer to be unfolded is a prediction of the
primer structure after the qRT-PCR test denaturation step at 95◦ C in the work done by
Vogels et al. [4] The predicted interaction structure for the E-Sarbeco-R primer when
Dinoknot was not given an input structure results in the bases at positions 8-15 in the
reverse primer binding as expected to the target region. However, bases 5-7 paired with
bases 16-18 and the remaining bases of the 22bp primer remained unpaired. When the
primer structure was input into DinoKnot as unfolded, as done for the HKU-N-R
primer, the E-Sarbeco-R primer fully paired to its target region. Both the HKU-N-R
and E-Sarbeco primer-probe sets were shown experimentally by Vogels et al. to have
analytical efficiencies and sensitivities that are comparable to the other primer-probe
sets that were predicted by DinoKnot to bind completely to their target region; this
supports the structures predicted with their primer structure is forced unfolded [4].

The RdRp-SARSr-R primer contains two degenerate bases, R and S. This means that
an A or G may be present in the position of the R and a C or G may be present in the
position of the S.
All combinations were given as input to DinoKnot and the predicted structures are
shown in Fig 3. Fig 3 represents the interaction site only. The complete structures can

Fig 3. Interaction structures of the RdRp-SARS-R primer predicted by
DinoKnot with all of the possible base combinations from the degenerate
primers. The RdRp-SARS-R primer contains the degenerate bases R and S, which
means an A or G may be present at the R position and a C or G may be present at the
S position. All possible combinaions were predicted. The S position was also input as
an A to predict if this change may increase primer sensitivity.

entered as a G. The target nucleotide is a U at both of the positions where the R and S
base bind. The structures were also predicted with an A input at the position of the
degenerate base S. This change was suggested by Vogels et al. to possibly increase the
sensitivity of this primer-probe set because it was found experimentally to have the
lowest sensitivity of all the primer-probe sets [4]. However, this change resulted in the
primer not binding to its target region.

The mutations listed by Vogels et al. are shown in Table 3, along with the interaction
structure energies [4]. The resulting structures are shown in Fig 4. Fig 4 represents the

information on the DinoKnot Github page. The effects of the mutation on the
interaction structure are compared to the primer binding ability of the primer/probes to
the reference genome NC 045512.2. All primer/probes paired as expected to the target
area of the reference genome with the exception of the 2019-nCoV N3-F primer which
has one unpaired base at the 3’ end.

The mutations in the primer binding region of the CCDC-N-F at base pair positions

The mutation in the primer binding region of 2019-nCoV N3-F mutation at base
pair position 28,688 did not change the structure. The primer is still able to bind to the
mutated base, but the final base at the 3’ end of the primer remains unpaired. However,
this unpaired base is the same in the structure of the 2019-nCoV N3-F primer
interacting with the reference genome NC 045512.2.

remaining 16/21 bases of the forward primer are still able to bind to their target
nucleotides.

binding 600 bp downstream of the target region and partial base pairing of the primer

Discussion

274

We used DinoKnot to predict the secondary structure of the interaction between RNA
transcripts from the SARS-CoV-2 genome and the reverse primers from nine
primer-probe sets in order to see if the RNA structure of SARS-CoV-2 affected reverse
primer binding. In addition, We predicted how mutations listed by Vogels et al. in the
primer/probe binding regions may affect the binding ability of the primer/probes, and
thus, SARS-CoV-2 detection. We found that all reverse primers were able to interact
with their target regions and predicted partial mismatching to occur between some
reverse primers. We also predicted three mutations to prevent the ability of the
primer/probe to bind to their target region.
Reverse primer interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome: The
following primers were predicted to have partial mismatching in the primer binding
region: 2019-nCoV N2-R, HKU-N-R, E-Sarbeco-R, and RdRp-SARSr-R. The
2019-nCoV N2, E-Sarbeco and HKU-N primer-probe sets had analytical efficiencies and
sensitivities that are similar to the other primer-probe sets [4]. The RdRp-SARSr
primer-probe set had an analytical efficiency comparable to the other primer-probe sets
but a reduced sensitivity [4].
The single base mismatch in the 2019-nCoV N2-R primer is unlikely to affect the
ability of the reverse transcriptase to generate the cDNA strand. The reverse
transcriptase generates the cDNA strand in the 5’ to 3’ direction so a mismatch at the 3’
end is unlikely to affect strand synthesis. As well, this primer-probe sets had high
analytical efficiency and sensitivity shown by Vogels et al. which supports that this
mismatch is unlikely to have an effect on cDNA strand synthesis [4]
The mismatching in the E-Sarbeco-R and HKU-N-R primers occur when the primer
is assumed to have structure prior to interaction with the target. However, when the
primer was forced in DinoKnot as unfolded, the program predicts the E-Sarbeco-R
primer to fully bind to its target sequence and the HKU-N -R primer to bind with a
single mismatch at the 5’ end of the primer. Since the qRT-PCR assay used by Vogels
et al. has a denaturation step of 95◦ C and an annealing step of 55◦ C, it can be assumed
that the primer is fully unfolded at those temperatures because the E-Sarbeco-R and
HKU-N-R had primer efficiencies comparable to the other primers as determined by
Vogels et al. [4].
The RdRp-SARSr-R primer contains two degenerate bases, R and S. Vogels et al.
determined that 990/992 of their SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples contain a T at the
position in the reference genome NC 045512.2 where the S base binds to its target [4].
This primer-probe set had the lowest sensitivity out of all of the primers [4]. During the
qRT-PCR test by Vogels et al. this primer-probe set had the highest Ct values, 6-10 Ct
values higher than the other sets, and is unable to detect low viral amounts [4].
DinoKnot was run with all possible combinations of the position of the degenerate base
R input as an A or G and S input as a C or G shown in Fig 3.
The combination that produced the expected match was when an A was input at the
R position and a G was input at the S postion. Vogels et al. proposed that changing the
S to an A in the reverse primer could increase the sensitivity of the primer-probe set [4].
To test this, the primer was given as input to DinoKnot with an A input at the S
position. All combinations where S was input as an A resulted in the primer not binding
to the target area. The result was the primer binding to itself and partial binding to the

5’ end of the transcript, over 400 bases downstream from the target area. Therefore,
this result indicates that changing the S to an A is unlikely to increase the sensitivity of
the primer even though the target base pair is a U in the RNA genome and a T on the
cDNA transcript. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the low sensitivity issue of
the RdRp-SARSr primer-probe set may be due to the predicted primer mismatch when
a G is present in the R and S position of the primer. Although the concentration of
each base combination at the degenerate R and S positions is not stated in the protocol,
if the assumption is made that the four combinations are present in equal amounts, this
may explain the low sensitivity issue of the RdRp primer probe-set [30] [4]. The base
combination where a G is present at both the R and S position is predicted to mismatch
to the target region. This would lower the RdRp-SARSr-R concentration that is capable
of binding to its target region. If the effective concentration of the RdRp-SARSr-R
primer is lower than the other primer-probe sets, this may explain why this set had low
sensitivity issues due to higher Ct values shown experimentally by Vogels et al. [4].
Therefore, we suggest that changing the base at the R position to an A and the base at
the S position to a G may increase the RdRp-SARSr primer-probe set sensitivity since
this base combination was predicted to perfectly bind to its target region.
Mutations in the expected primer/probe binding region: Vogels et al. looked
at 992 clinical samples and identified mutations in the expected primer binding regions
that could decrease the primer sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection [4]. We used
DinoKnot to predict how those mutations affect the ability of the primer/probe to bind
to its target sequence. Mutations in the expected binding region of the forward primer
and probe were DNA/DNA interactions and mutations in the reverse primer expected
binding region show both the RNA/DNA interaction and the DNA/DNA interaction.
Based on the interaction structures predicted by DinoKnot, the mutations in the
primer binding regions of the E-Sarbeco-R, N-HKU-F, and 2019-nCoV N3-R primers
are most likely to have the greatest effect on decreasing primer sensitivity for
SARS-CoV-2 detection. This is because the interaction structures predicted by
DinoKnot show no binding of the primer to the target area. All mutations resulted in
an increase in the energy of binding, except for the mutation in the CCDC-ORF1-P
binding region, which lowered the energy of binding. The energy increase means that
binding is not as favourable as before and in environments where there is competition
for binding, binding may not happen. The mutations in E-Sarbeco-R, N-HKU-F, and
2019-nCoV N3-R binding regions caused the greatest increase in binding energy.
The mutation in the primer binding region of the E-Sarbeco-R primer at base
position 26, 370 is predicted by DinoKnot to cause a complete mismatch between the
reverse primer and the RNA genome, as well as between the reverse primer and positive
sense cDNA strand. Therefore, this single base mutation may cause the mutated
SARS-CoV-2 strains to not be detected by the E-Sarbeco primer-probe set, especially
since the reverse primer is needed for the generation of the cDNA strand. Even if the
forward primer and probe can still bind as expected to their target sequence, if the
reverse primer cannot bind to the RNA genome, the reverse transcriptase will not be
able to generate the negative sense cDNA strand for the forward primer to bind to.
The mutation in the HKU-N-F primer binding region at position 29, 148 was
predicted by DinoKnot to result in the forward primer not being able to bind to its
target region. Without a functional forward primer, this would result in the inability to
generate a negative sense cDNA copy, and therefore no amplification of either the
positive sense or negative sense cDNA strand. As shown in Fig 1, the negative sense
cDNA is required for the generation of the positive sense cDNA strand and any
subsequent amplification. Even if the reverse primer and probe bind as expected to
their target region, there would only be the generation of one positive sense cDNA
strand and no amplification.

The mutation in the 2019-nCoV N3-R primer binding region at position 28, 739 is
predicted to cause a complete mismatch between the reverse primer and the RNA
genome. However, the reverse primer is able to bind to the target area on the positive
sense cDNA, except with one base pair mismatch at the mutated base. This mutation
may cause this strain not to be detected by this primer-probe set because if the reverse
primer does not bind to the target area on the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the reverse
transcriptase cannot generate the positive sense cDNA strand. Therefore, the binding of
the reverse primer to the negative sense cDNA strand interaction would not occur.
The CCDC-ORF1-F primer had a mismatch at the 3’ end of the primer causing the
5 bases at 3’ end to remain unpaired. The DNA polymerase generates the
complementary strand in the 5’-3’ direction. Since the 5’ end still binds, the full target
area may still be generated. In this primer-probe set, the probe binds to the same area
of the cDNA that the forward primer binds so having the full area of the transcript
generated is important. The 5 bases at the 3’ end did not align to any other part of the
reference genome in a NCBI BLAST search so it is unlikely but still possible that the
tail could bind to another part of the genome and hinder the ability of the DNA
polymerase to generate the cDNA strand, preventing SARS-CoV-2 detection [29]. This
mutation should be tested experimentally in order to determine its effect on the
primer-probe set’s ability for SARS-CoV-2 detection.
Viral Load and SARS-CoV-2 detection: Recent work by Pan et al. on 82 infected
individuals with SARS-CoV-2 determined the viral load in sputum and swab samples to
peak on day 5-6 after symptom onset, with a range of 104 to 107 copies per mL [34].
This is earlier than SARS-CoV which peaks approximately 10 days after symptom
onset [34]. Vogels et al. determined the qRT-PCR primer-probe sets to have a limit of
detection of 105 copies per mL except for the RdRp-SARSr primer-probe set which
tested negative in samples containing 100 -102 viral RNA copies/µL concentrations
(which is equivalent to 1-100 viral RNA copies/mL) [4]. Pan et al. determined that
early after the onset of symptoms, the viral load is greater than 1 × 106 copies per
mL [34]. This is sufficient for detection by the primer-probe sets, except for
RdRp-SARSr [4]. However, respiratory samples from 80 patients from different stages of
infection showed a range of 641 copies per mL to 1.34 × 1011 copies per mL. Therefore,
the more time that passes after symptom onset may result in the viral load to be below
the limit of detection during testing. If patients are tested a greater number of days
after symptom onset when the viral load may be below the primer-probe set limit of
detection determined by Vogels et al., this could result in a false negative test. However,
nasopharyngeal swabs are the most common ways to collect patient samples and the
work by Pan et al. only looked at one nasal swab which was tested 3 days after
symptom onset with a total of 1.69 × 105 copies per mL [2, 34].
In a patient led survey, 27.5% of respondents believed they had COVID-19 but
tested negative for the disease [35]. This group of respondents were on average tested
later, by day 16, compared to the 21% of respondents who believed they had COVID-19
and also tested positive, who were on average tested by day 10 [35]. As is a limitation of
this survey we cannot verify whether the respondents who believed they had COVID-19
were in fact infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, since they were tested later, this may
support the hypothesis that the viral load may be below the limit of detection if the test
is taken a greater number of days after symptom onset. Therefore false negative tests
are likely an issue with having enough viral load in the sample rather than an issue with
the primer interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 genome since DinoKnot predicted correct
primer binding for most of the primers at the higher temperatures.
We hypothesize that a SARS-CoV-2 aptamer test is beneficial to provide a lower
limit of detection. Aptamers are single stranded RNA or DNA nucleotides (10-100nt)
that are able to bind to targets such as viruses and proteins [36]. Aptamers’ binding

specificity is ensured by their secondary and tertiary structure [36]. An RNA aptamer
test designed for the SARS-CoV Nucleocapsid protein showed a detection limit of 2
pg/mL [37]. A recent aptamer test for Norovirus, a positive sense RNA virus, has a
limit of detection of 200 viral copies/mL [38]. This is lower than the qRT-PCR limit of
detection of determined by Vogels et al. by a magnitude of 103 [4]. The lower limit of
detection that is possible with aptamer tests would be beneficial in testing patients later
after symptom onset.
We believe that an aptamer test can be designed for SARS-CoV-2 that both
improves the detection sensitivity and provides a more rapid test compared to the
qRT-PCR tests currently in use. The areas targeted in the primer-probe sets may be
good targets for aptamer design, since they are specific to SARS-CoV-2. Zooming in on
these regions in the GISAID h-CoV-19 app, it can be shown that these areas generally
have few mutations, as compared to the number of mutations that can be seen in the
entire genome as shown in Fig 5 [33].

Our findings may be beneficial in a starting place for aptamer design. The
HKU-ORF1 primer-probe set was the only set to have its reverse primer completely
bind its target sequence and not contain any mutations in the primer/probe target areas
in the 992 clinical samples looked at by Vogels et al. [4]. The GISAID h-CoV-19 app
also shows the area targeted by this primer-probe set to have a low number of mutation
events [33]. The 2019-nCoV N2 primer-probe set did not have any mutations in the
primer/probe binding regions listed by Vogels et al. but the reverse primer did contain
the one base pair mismatch to the reference genome. The areas targeted by these
primer-probe sets may be suitable targets for designing a SARS-CoV-2 aptamer test
since these areas are specific for SARS-CoV-2 and contain few mutations.

We introduced the program DinoKnot that is able to predict the secondary structure of
two interacting nucleotide sequences. By in silico prediction we provided evidence to
support that during COVID-19 qRT-PCR tests, the reverse primers investigated here
are binding to their expected target region on the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our prediction
supports that binding is not prevented by the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2
RNA genome. This supports the idea that the correct area of the SARS-CoV-2 genome
is being amplified during the qRT-PCR tests and the RNA structure does not prevent
SARS-CoV-2 detection. Our prediction also provides a hypothesis to explain the low
sensitivity issue of the RdRp-SARSr primer-probe set and we suggest changing the
degenerate base positions in the RdRp-SARSr-R from an R to an A and an S to a G to
potentially increase the sensitivity.
We also predicted how different mutations in the primer binding region affected
primer binding and that the SARS-CoV-2 strains with mutations in the E-Sarbeco-R,
N-HKU-F, and 2019-nCoV N3-R primer binding regions may reduce the sensitivity of
these COVID-19 tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection.
Finally we hypothesize that an aptamer test may be a better way to test for
COVID-19 since it can provide a lower limit of detection. Further research is required to
quantify the viral load at each stage of infection and determine at what point the

qRT-PCR can no longer detect COVID-19 so that conclusions can be made on the
impact of the limit of detection affecting false negative test results.
DinoKnot can also be used as a tool to aid in the prevention of false positive results
during the design COVID-19 and other nucleic acid based testing. A false positive test
would involve the non-specific binding of the primer-probe sets to a source other than
the target in the patient sample. Future work can be done using our program DinoKnot
to predict the interaction between primer/probes with other pathogens and nucleic acid
sequences that may be present in patient samples to determine what the primer/probes
may be capable of binding to produce false positive results.
