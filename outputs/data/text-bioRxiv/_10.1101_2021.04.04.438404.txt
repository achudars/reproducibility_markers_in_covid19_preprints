One Sentence Summary:
While pregnant and lactating women mount comparable final antibody titers to non-pregnant in
response to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, pregnant and lactating women have a longer
window of vulnerability after the first dose, develop different functional and FcR-binding
profiles compared to non-pregnant, and exhibit distinct responses to Moderna and
Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.

Abstract
Significant immunological changes occur throughout pregnancy to tolerize the mother
and allow growth of the fetal graft. However, additional local and systemic immunological
adaptations also occur, allowing the maternal immune system to continue to protect the dyad
against foreign invaders both during pregnancy and after birth through lactation. This fine
balance of tolerance and immunity, along with physiological and hormonal changes, contribute
to increased susceptibility to particular infections in pregnancy, including more severe COVID19 disease. Whether these changes also make pregnant women less responsive to vaccination or
induce altered immune responses to vaccination remains incompletely understood. To
holistically define potential changes in vaccine response during pregnancy and lactation, we
deeply profiled the humoral vaccine response in a group of pregnant and lactating women and
non-pregnant age-matched controls. Vaccine-specific titers were comparable, albeit slightly
lower, between pregnant and lactating women, compared to non-pregnant controls. Among
pregnant women, we found higher antibody titers and functions in those vaccinated with the
Moderna vaccine. FcR-binding and antibody effector functions were induced with delayed
kinetics in both pregnant and lactating women compared to non-pregnant women. Antibody
boosting resulted in high FcR-binding titers in breastmilk. These data point to an immune
resistance to generate highly inflammatory antibodies during pregnancy and lactation, and a
critical need to follow prime/boost timelines in this vulnerable population to ensure full
immunity is attained.

Introduction
Pregnant women experience both increased disease severity and morbidity upon SARSCoV-2 infection (1, 2). However, pregnant and lactating women were left out of initial COVID19 vaccine trials due to heightened safety concerns (3–6). Given that pregnant women are
vulnerable to severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, it is important to understand the immunological
response

to

vaccination

in

pregnant

and

lactating

women.

Understanding

how

pregnancy/lactation affects response to vaccination and antibody transfer to infants offers critical
opportunities to guide recommendations for this population.
Pregnant and lactating women are routinely encouraged to receive vaccines against
influenza and pertussis (7, 8). Mounting data point to dampened vaccine-induced antibody
responses in pregnant women marked by a lower fold increase in antibody titers, lower
neutralizing antibody responses, and reduced T cell immune responses compared to nonpregnant women (9). Given the significant morbidity associated with influenza infection in
pregnant women annually, influenza vaccination is recommended throughout gestation (10),
whereas pertussis vaccination is recommended in the late second and early third trimester, to
facilitate maximal antibody transfer and protect the developing neonate (11–13). However,
because most women have been exposed or previously immunized against these pathogens, these
vaccines largely boost immunity, rather than prime a de novo immune response. Thus, whether
the same principles for antibody transfer will apply to novel vaccine platforms used against
SARS-CoV-2, as well as to a new antigen (SARS-CoV-2 spike), remains unclear. Moreover,
whether vaccine-induced immune profiles will vary across pregnancy and lactation, impacting
antibody transit across the placenta or into breastmilk, is not known. This understanding could

provide crucial insights to guide the optimal administration of the vaccine to women and their
infants.
The first two vaccines that were approved for emergency use authorization (EUA) by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are novel vaccine platforms that use mRNA to induce an
immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Linked to highly effective protection against
severe COVID-19 disease in non-pregnant populations (14, 15), both mRNA platforms clearly
lead to the induction of robust immunity in men and non-pregnant women across age groups
(Anderson et al., 2020; Walsh et al., 2020). Moreover, emerging data suggest that mRNA
vaccines also induce comparable antibody titers and neutralization in pregnant and lactating
women, linked to transfer of antibodies to neonates (16, 17). The explosion of multiple vaccine
platforms, coupled with the availability of novel high-dimensional antibody profiling
technologies, enables the unprecedented opportunity to dissect the de novo mRNA vaccineinduced immune response in this vulnerable population.
In addition to the role of antibodies in binding and neutralization, antibodies contribute to
protection against COVID-19 disease through their ability to recruit the innate immune response
with their Fc-domain (18, 19). The Fc-functions of the humoral immune response play a critical
role in resolution of COVID-19 (20), are associated with protection from infection following
vaccination (21), play a critical role in antibody transfer across the placenta (22–25) and may
also influence transfer into breastmilk (26). To define qualitative features of the vaccine-induced
humoral immune response across pregnancy and early life, here we comprehensively profiled the
humoral immune response following mRNA vaccination in pregnant, lactating, or non-pregnant
women who received the Pfizer/BioNTech or the Moderna vaccine. While overall antibody titers
were comparable, we observed reduced Fc-receptor (FcR)-binding and functional antibody

evolution in pregnant and lactating women that required a boost to reach full functional
capabilities. Compromised placental transfer was observed, likely due to vaccination close in
timing to delivery, with improved transfer noted with increased time from immunization. Robust
levels of IgG and IgA were noted in breastmilk. Differences were observed across vaccine
platforms, marked by differential skewing of IgG and IgA responses in blood and milk. These
data point to significant differences in vaccine-induced antibody profiles among pregnant,
lactating and non-pregnant women that influence the level and quality of immune transfer to
neonates, clearly arguing for a need for timely boosting in this vulnerable population and a a
need to understand how timing of vaccine administration in pregnancy impacts maternal immune
response and placental antibody transfer.

Results
The vaccination-induced antibody response in pregnant, lactating, and non-pregnant
women
Two mRNA vaccines were the first EUA approved vaccines, showing ~95% protection
against severe COVID-19 disease (14, 27–29). Emerging data have begun to illustrate the robust
immunogenicity of these vaccines in pregnant and lactating women, in the absence of enhanced
reactogenicity (16). However, whether the overall humoral immune profile diverges in pregnant
or lactating women and if these profiles impact transfer to neonates remains incompletely
understood. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 humoral immune response was characterized in a cohort of
84 pregnant, 31 lactating and 16 non-pregnant age-matched controls. Individuals were sampled
before vaccination (V0), after first vaccination (prime, V1) and/or after second vaccination
(boost, V2).

After the prime, clear differences were noted between serum antibody responses of
pregnant/lactating women and non-pregnant women (Figure 1A). Most differences related to
lower antibody titers after the prime (PC1) and Fc-receptor (FcR) binding capacity (PC2) among
pregnant and lactating women compared with non-pregnant women. After the boost, there were
no significant differences between pregnant/lactating and non-pregnant women (Figure 1B).
Although some differences persisted, differences were nearly exclusively linked to enhanced
FcR-binding in non-pregnant women.
To further understand the difference in individual antibody features in pregnant, lactating,
and non-pregnant women, we plotted the mean percentile rank of each spike (S)-specific feature
measured at V1 and V2 (Figure 1C-D). After the prime (V1), non-pregnant women had higher
IgG subclass responses, higher antibody functions and higher FcR-binding compared to pregnant
and lactating women (Figure 1C). At this time point, pregnant and lactating women had a
similar antibody response. Interestingly, after the boost (V2), lactating women boosted their
antibody response more effectively than pregnant women, marked by higher IgG-levels and
higher NK-cell activity (%CD107a+ and %MIP-1b+) (Figure 1D). After boost, the vaccine
response in lactating women was similar to that of non-pregnant women, although lactating
women had lower FcR-binding compared to non-pregnant women, who maintained higher FcRbinding levels after the boost.
Next, to specifically capture the differences in the quality of the vaccine induced humoral
immune response across the women, FcR-binding and Fc-effector profiles were compared at a
univariate level across the groups. Strikingly, FcR-binding antibodies across all FcRs were
significantly higher in non-pregnant compared to pregnant and lactating women at V1 (Figure
1E). However, the boost raised these antibody responses in both pregnant and lactating women,

albeit to lower levels than observed in non-pregnant women (Figure 1E). Slight, but largely
insignificant, differences were noted in antibody isotype and subclass evolution across the
groups (Supplemental Figure 1), with small rises in antibody levels following boosting.
Interestingly, whereas antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) was induced at similar
levels in the three populations and was not increased by the vaccine boost, antibody-dependent
neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP) was similar between groups after the prime and was augmented
in all 3 groups after boosting, with the most significant boost in lactating women (Figure 1F).
The ability of antibodies to drive NK cell activation (CD107a, a degranulation marker and MIP1β, a chemokine) was distinct across the groups, whereby lactating women induced significantly
higher NK cell activating antibodies after boosting compared to pregnant and non-pregnant
women (Figure 1F). Overall, these higher FcR-binding profiles in non-pregnant and lactating
women were linked to enhanced coordination in the humoral immune responses compared to
pregnant women, the latter showing sparser coordination in the vaccine induced humoral
immune response (Figure 1G). These data reveal that pregnant and lactating women show
potential early deficiencies in their vaccine induced immune response, that recover at boosting in
lactating women and to a lesser extent in pregnant women.

Differences in maternal serum vs cord blood antibodies
Previous studies focused on pertussis vaccination have pointed to the selective and active
transfer of highly functional antibodies across the placenta, marked by the specific selective
transfer of FcγR3a binding antibodies (23). However, more recent studies of SARS-CoV-2
infection in pregnancy have noted compromised transfer with infection in the third trimester,
linked to reduced antibody transfer (transfer ratio < 1) but maintaining a selection bias based on

binding to FcγR3a (25). To begin to understand the overall profiles of antibodies that are
transferred from pregnant individuals to infants, we profiled the humoral immune responses
across the maternal and umbilical cord blood. Overall, higher levels of antibodies were observed
in maternal blood compared to cord blood (Figure 2A). Variable patterns of transfer of IgG titer,
FcR-binding and antibody function were observed from the mother to the cord (Figure 2B-C).
Despite the recency of vaccination, equivalent, IgG1 spike (S)-specific titers were transferred
across the placenta to the infant (Figure 2A). Lower IgG3 transfer was noted. Lower FcRbinding antibodies were transferred. Despite previous observations of augmented NK cell
activating antibody transfer following vaccines that boost previously established immunity, such
as to pertussis and influenza (23), stable phagocytic antibodies but decreased NK-cell activating
antibody were transferred to infants (Figure 2B). Conversely, active transfer of more functional
NK cell activating antibodies was noted for influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-specific antibodies in
the same mother:cord pairs (Supplemental Figure 2A-B) suggesting that reduced transfer of Sspecific antibodies is not attributable to vaccine-induced changes in placental activity. Instead,
decreased S-specific transfer could be linked to time from vaccination (Supplemental Figure
2C-D), suggesting that vaccination proximal to the time of birth may simply not permit the
effective transfer of the most functional antibody subpopulations.
Given the de novo nature of the response to SARS-CoV-2 S and the novelty of this
vaccine platform, we next aimed to determine whether placenta transfer was strictly governed by
total amounts of antibody or based on specific characteristics of the vaccine-induced humoral
immune response. Thus, we performed a multilevel partial least squares discriminant analysis
(mPLSDA) to determine the S-specific antibody features that transferred preferentially across the
cord (Figure 2D, right). Fc-profiles in maternal and cord blood were completely distinct, with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.04.438404; this version posted April 5, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

expected higher overall levels of antibodies in maternal blood, as the vaccine was only
administered in these dyads in the third trimester. However, despite the lower levels of
antibodies in the cord, receptor binding domain-specific FcγR3a binding was enriched in the
cord (Figure 2D, left). Thus, similar to the previously observed transfer sieve, even at low
antibody-transfer rates, the placenta selects for FcγRIIIa-binding, functionally enhanced vaccineinduced antibodies aimed at enriching infants with the most protective antibodies.

Optimal vaccine-induced antibody transfer to the breastmilk requires boosting
Beyond placental transfer, antibody transfer can continue to occur after birth through
breastmilk. Vaccine immunity changes over time in immunized lactating women, but how this
influences antibody transfer to the infant is incompletely understood. Using an unsupervised
PCA of the post-prime and post-boost vaccine induced immune response, we observed a slightly
expanded antibody functional and FcR-binding response in the serum of lactating women after
the boost (Figure 3A), pointing to a functional maturation of the humoral immune response with
boosting. Similarly, in breastmilk, boosting resulted in the robust transfer of FcR-binding
antibodies and highly functional IgG3 antibodies (Figure 3B and Supplemental Figure 3A). To
gain specific insights into the antibody subpopulations that are transferred most efficiently across
the blood and breastmilk, we next plotted the mean percentile rank of each spike-specific
antibody feature for the prime and boost (Figure 3C-D). The polar plots highlight the
preferential boosting of FcR-binding IgG responses in the serum following boosting, with a
prominent expansion of IgG and FcR binding, but only a marginal impact on enhancing IgA and
IgM responses (Figure 3C). Moreover, the same transfer profile was noted in the breastmilk
(Figure 3D), with a high transfer of IgGs with FcR-binding capabilities after the boost. To

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.04.438404; this version posted April 5, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

further understand the sieve of antibodies from serum to breastmilk upon vaccination, we plotted
the transfer ratio (breastmilk MFI/serum MFI) of isotypes and FcRs against the SARS-CoV-2
spike after the first dose (Figure 3E) and after the boost (Figure 3F and Supplemental Figure
3B). After the prime and the boost, IgA was the most preferentially transferred of any isotype.
Interestingly, IgG2 was transferred more highly to breastmilk than any other IgG subclass after
the first dose, but after the boost, IgG3 was the most highly transferred subclass. Moreover, after
the first dose, there was a preferential transfer of antibodies that could bind FcγR3a, whereas
antibodies that could bind FcγR2b, the inhibitory FcR, had the lowest transfer ratio. After the
boost, however, there were no significant differences in the transfer of FcR-binding antibodies,
pointing to robust transfer of all FcR-binding antibodies to breastmilk after a boost. In addition,
we analyzed the transfer ratio of antibody functions after prime and after boost. Whereas ADCP
and ADNP were transferred at equivalent ratios after prime (Figure 3G), antibodies able to drive
ADCP were transferred at a higher ratio than those able to activate ADNP (Figure 3G), likely
reflecting the enhanced ADNP activity in the serum of lactating women after boost. In addition,
NK-cell activating antibodies were transferred at low levels post-boost (Supplemental Figure
3C), suggesting a sieve at the mammary gland, preventing the transfer of highly inflammatory
antibodies through breastmilk. This analysis revealed enhanced functional antibodies in
breastmilk following the boost, accompanied by decreased IgM and IgA induction post-boost.
Collectively, these data emphasize that while the breast clearly enriches IgM and IgA delivery to
the breastmilk (30, 31),vaccination appears to dramatically augment highly functional IgG transit
to the milk that are likely key to antiviral immunity across viral pathogens (31).

Moderna and Pfizer vaccination induce differential antibody responses

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.04.438404; this version posted April 5, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

While both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines exploit mRNA-based technologies,
differences in mRNA dosage, lipid carriers, and vaccine dosing regimens may alter the quality of
the humoral immune response across the vaccines. Thus, we compared immune responses across
all women dosed with these mRNA vaccines. Although minimal differences were noted across
the vaccine-induced immune responses post-prime (V1) (Supplemental Figure 3A), separation
was observable in the vaccine-induced antibody profiles following the boost (V2) (Figure 4A).
Notably, Moderna mRNA vaccinated women exhibited enriched neutrophil activating antibodies
(ADNP), higher levels of vaccine-specific IgA, IgG2, IgG3, and NK cell activating antibodies
(CD107a) compared to Pfizer vaccinated women (Figure 4A, Supplemental Figure 3B).
Conversely, women receiving the Pfizer vaccine exhibited a slight enrichment of IgG1- and
FcγR3A (Figure 4A) binding humoral immune responses.
To further dissect these differences, women were split into groups by their pregnancy and
lactation status. While differences in IgA levels were noted across all groups, differences in
ADNP, and NK cell recruiting antibodies were amplified in pregnant and lactating women
(Figure 4B), with a dramatic expansion of functional antibodies in women following the
Moderna mRNA vaccine. Moreover, to further understand the functional basis for these
differences in function, we examined the functional coordination of the humoral immune
response induced by each vaccine across the 3 populations of women (Figure 4C). Strikingly,
Moderna vaccination resulted in a more focused functional coordination in the humoral immune
response, centered around a highly functional IgG1/IgG3 response with robust FcR-binding and
functional coordination. Conversely, women receiving the Pfizer vaccine generated a broader
coordinated immune response including IgG2 and IgM responses and the exclusion of monocyte
phagocytosis (ADCP), potentially pointing to a more diffuse overall humoral immune

coordination profile. These serum differences translated to differences in breastmilk transfer
(Figure 4D), with enhanced FcR-binding antibody and neutrophil-functional antibody transfer to
breastmilk observed in Moderna-immunized lactating women. Whether these differences are
attributable to dose, lipids, or timing of vaccination remains unclear, but provide the first clues
that mRNA platforms may be selectively deployed to enhance protection in neonates once
precise mechanistic correlates of immunity are defined.

Discussion
Both EUA-approved COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have been shown to be safe and highly
immunogenic in non-pregnant populations (14, 15), and emerging data suggest that the vaccines
are immunogenic and similarly reactogenic in pregnant and lactating women (16). However,
pregnancy and lactation represent distinct immunological states (32, 33), that have been
previously associated with reduced immunogenicity (9). Whether this unique immune state is
associated with the evolution of distinct humoral immune profiles upon vaccination remains
incompletely understood. Using systems serology, we observed changes in the magnitude,
kinetics, and quality of functional profiles of vaccine-induced antibodies. We additionally found
differences in the overall antibody profile across women receiving the Moderna and
Pfizer/BioNtech vaccines.

These findings collectively point to an extended window of

vulnerability in pregnancy/lactation following vaccination, requiring timely boosting to achieve
fully functional matured antibodies to empower the pregnant individual and their child.
Pregnancy represents a delicate immunological balance which has been associated with
enhanced vulnerabilities to infection in pregnant women who experience more severe influenza
infection and SARS-CoV-2 infection (34, 35). This vulnerability has been linked to dampened,

rather than blocked, pro-inflammatory immunity, with reduced responsiveness to vaccination (9).
Beyond quantitative measures of pregnancy associated changes, less is known about the
qualitative functional changes in the vaccine-induced humoral response during pregnancy. Here,
we observed a delay in the evolution of FcR-binding and functional antibody responses in
pregnant and lactating women after initial vaccination with a de novo pathogen. Conversely, we
observed higher levels of functional antibodies for NK cell activity and neutrophil phagocytosis
in lactating women compared to both pregnant and non-pregnant women upon boost. These data
point to distinct response profiles across each of these immunological states, raising the
possibility that vaccines may drive significantly different antibody functional profiles,
programmed evolutionarily to maximize protection for the mother-baby dyad in that unique
immune state. Given the low responsiveness to vaccination after prime, these data also highlight
the critical importance to adhere to vaccination boosting among this population to optimize
immunity in pregnant and lactating women.
Vaccination during pregnancy increases the passive protection transferred to newborns,
who are at increased risk for severe disease upon infection due to their immature immune
system. Although few newborns have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, those who have been
infected have more severe outcomes than older children (36–38). In the case of natural infection,
poor placental transfer of antibodies has been observed in women infected in the third trimester,
but these transfer ratios increase significantly to expected levels above a transfer ratio of 1 in
women infected earlier in pregnancy (39, 40). Likewise, women in our study that gave birth were
all immunized in the third trimester and had transfer ratios above one, likely reflective of the
proximity of vaccination to delivery. As more women vaccinated in the second trimester and
earlier go on to deliver, it will be important to determine whether the COVID vaccines, which

induce novel immune responses to pathogens never seen by our immune systems, may require
administration even earlier in pregnancy than vaccines that evoke recall responses to offer
optimal immunity to the neonate. In addition to antibodies transferred through the placenta,
antibodies transferred through breastmilk have been shown to play a role in the protection
against respiratory infections during early life (41–43). Interestingly, breastmilk antibodies are
highly dependent on the second dose of the vaccine to boost the transfer of functional, FcRbinding antibodies. Previous work has shown that IgGs in breastmilk may provide protection
against viral infection in early life (44–46). Defining the mechanism driving breastmilk transfer
of IgGs could lay the foundation for designing next generation vaccines able to provide global
protection for infants following birth.
Despite the delayed kinetics and functional antibody responses in pregnant versus nonpregnant women, pregnant and lactating women generated more functional neutrophil and NK
cell recruiting antibodies after receiving the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer/BioNtech
vaccine.

These enhanced functions were accompanied by a more restrictive, coordinated

humoral immune response compared to women who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.
Whether this is related to differences in the dose, the lipid carriers, or the dosing window (4 vs. 3
weeks) remains unclear. The extra week prior to boosting may provide the time needed for the
humoral immune response to mature, resulting in more functional antibody profiles. Whether the
functional advantage described here in the Moderna-generated humoral immune profile results in
improved clinical protection against COVID-19 remains to be determined. Critically, optimal
dosing and intervals may vary across populations and should be based on empirical data,
strongly arguing for the importance of research in pregnancy and lactation to protect this
vulnerable population who are often neglected during vaccine development.

Overall, our data have demonstrated that while antibody titers are similar, pregnant and
lactating women respond to vaccination in qualitatively and kinetically distinct manners
compared to non-pregnant women. While this study largely profiled responses in women
vaccinated later in pregnancy, these data point to the importance of profiling women receiving
COVID-19 vaccines throughout pregnancy to begin to understand how distinct platforms,
vaccines, populations, and timing affect the quality and quantity of immunity induced across the
mother:fetal dyad. Collectively, these data highlight to the importance of defining the
immunology of pregnancy to develop evidence-based recommendations for vaccine
recommendations and to help inspire the development of vaccines and therapeutics that may act
more effectively for this unique population where optimal immunological responses are
necessary to protect both mother and fetus.

Materials and Methods
Study participants
Women at two tertiary care centers were approached for enrollment in an IRB-approved
(protocol #2020P003538) COVID-19 pregnancy and lactation biorepository study between
December 17, 2020 and February 23, 2021. Eligible women were: (n=84 pregnant; n=31
lactating; or n=16 non-pregnant and of reproductive age (18-45); greater than or equal to 18
years old, able to provide informed consent, and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.

Study Eligibility
Eligible study participants were identified by practitioners at the participating hospitals or were
self-referred. A study questionnaire was administered to assess pregnancy and lactation status,

history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, timing of COVID-19 vaccine doses, type of COVID-19
vaccine received (BNT162b2 Pfizer/BioNTech (n= 65) or mRNA-1273 Moderna/NIH (n= 66)).

Sample Collection
Blood and breastmilk from lactating women were collected at: V0 (at the time of first vaccine
dose/baseline), V1 (at the time of second vaccine dose/ “prime” profile), V2 (2-5.5 weeks
following the 2nd vaccine dose/ “boost” profile), and at delivery (for pregnant participants who
delivered during the study timeframe). Umbilical cord blood was also collected at delivery for
pregnant participants. The V2 timepoint reflects full antibody complement, achieved one week
after Pfizer/BioNTech and two weeks after Moderna/NIH10,11. Blood was collected by
venipuncture (or from the umbilical vein following delivery for cord blood) into serum separator
and EDTA tubes. Blood was centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min at room temperature. Sera and
plasma were aliquoted into cryogenic vials and stored at -80°C.

Antigens
Antigens used for functional and Luminex based assays were: SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Sino
Biological), SARS-CoV-2 Spike (LakePharma), SARS-CoV-2 N (Aalto Bio Reagents) and a
mix of HA A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1), HA A/Singapore/ INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2), HA
B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Immunetech). Antigen was biotinylated using Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC biotin

THP-1 cells used in phagocytic assays were grown in RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS,
5% penn/strep, 5% L-glutamine, 5% HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) and 0.5% 2-Mercaptoethanol, and
maintained at 2.5x105 cells/ml.

Primary Cells
Human neutrophils and NK cells were isolated from fresh peripheral blood. Peripheral blood was
collected by the MGH Blood Bank or by the Ragon Institute from healthy volunteers. All
volunteers were over 18 years of age and gave signed consent. Samples were deidentified before
use. The study was approved by the MGH Institutional Review Board. Human neutrophils were
maintained in R10 (RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin
and HEPES) and grown at 37ºC, 5%CO2 for the duration of the assay. Human NK cells were
rested overnight in R10 supplemented with IL-15 at 37ºC, 5%CO2 and maintained in R10 for the
duration of the assay.

Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis
Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis was assessed using a flow cytometry-based
phagocytic assay (47). Briefly, 1.0 µm, yellow-green fluorescent (505/515) FluoSpheres™
NeutrAvidin (Thermo Fisher) were coated with biotinylated S or HA, incubated with serum
samples diluted 1:100, and breastmilk diluted at 1:10. The ability of samples to drive uptake of
antigen-coated beads by THP-1 cells after overnight incubation was assessed by flow cytometry
using the iQue (Intellicyt). Phagocytic scores were calculated as follows: (% yellow-green+ cells
x yellow-green MFI)/100. A pool of SARS-CoV2 infected patients was used as a positive

control, and a pool of non-infected patient serum and 1xPBS alone was used as a negative
control. Samples were run in duplicate. Data reported is an average of all data points collected.

Antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis
Antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis was measured by a flow cytometry-based assay
(48). Briefly, serum samples were diluted 1:100, while breast milk was diluted at 1:10. Samples
were then allowed to form immune complexes with with 1.0 µm yellow-green fluorescent
(505/515 nm) FluoSpheres™ NeutrAvidin (Thermo Fisher) beads coated with biotinylated
antigen S or HA antigens. Neutrophils isolated from whole blood, obtained as mentioned above,
using ACK Lysing Buffer (ThermoFischer) at room temperature (1:10). After lysis, remaining
cells were counted and resuspended at 2.5x105 cells/ml in complete RPMI media. Cells were
then incubated with bead/Ab mixture for 1 hr at 37ºC and then stained with PacificBlueconjugated anti-CD66b (Biolegend) in PBS. Finally, cells were fixed in 4% PFA and
phagocytosis of beads by CD66b+ positive cells was measured by flow cytometry using the iQue
(Intellicyt). A pool of SARS-CoV2 infected patients was used as a positive control, and a pool of
non-infected patient serum and 1xPBS alone was used as a negative control. Samples were run in
duplicate. Data reported is an average of data points collected from two donors.

Antibody-dependent NK cell degranulation
Antibody dependent NK cell degranulation as described previously (49). Briefly, antigen coated
to 96-well ELISA plates were coated with 2 g/ml S or HA protein and incubated at 37ºC for 2hrs
and blocked with 5% BSA at 4ºC overnight. NK cells were isolated from whole blood from
healthy donors (as mentioned above) by negative selection using RosetteSep (STEMCELL

Technologies) then separated using a ficoll gradient. NK cells were rested overnight in media
supplemented with IL-15. Serum samples were diluted 1:50 and breastmilk at 1:5. After
blocking, samples were incubated with antigen coated plates for 2 hrs at 37°C to allow immune
complexes to form. After the 2 hr immune complex incubation, NK cells were mixed with antiCD107a–phycoerythrin (PE)–Cy5 (BD), brefeldin A (10 µg/ml) (Sigma), and GolgiStop (BD),
and added to antigen/ ab- coated plates for 5 hours at 37°C. The cells were stained for surface
markers using anti-CD3 PacBlue (BD), anti-CD16 APC-Cy5 (BD), and anti-CD56 PE-Cy7 (BD)
and fixed with PermA (Life Tech). NK cells were then permeabilized with Perm B (Life Tech)
and stained with the cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry on the iQue (Intellicyt). NK
cells were gates as CD3-, CD16+, CD56+ cells and NK cell activity was determined as the
percent of NK cells positive for CD107a and MIP-1b. ADNKA was only performed on V2
samples and cord blood.

Luminex
Serum samples were run in a customized Luminex assay to quantify the relative concentration of
antigen-specific antibody isotype and subclass profiles. Carboxylated magplex-microspheres
(Luminex) were coupled to antigens SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Sino Biological), SARS-CoV-2 S
(Lake Pharma), SARS-CoV-2 N (Aalto Bio Reagents). SARS-CoV-2 S1 (Sino Biological),
SARS-CoV-2 S2 (Sino Biological), pertussis pertactin (List Reagents) and a mix of HA

and breastmilk (1:5 for all detectors), was added to the antigen-coupled microspheres, and plates
were incubated overnight at 4ºC, shaking at 700 rpm. The following day, plates were washed
with 0.1% BSA 0.02% Tween-20. PE-coupled mouse anti-human detection antibodies (Southern
Biotech) were used to detect antigen-specific antibody binding. For the detection of FcR binding,
Avi-Tagged FcRs (Duke Human Vaccine Institute) were biotinylated using BirA500 kit
(Avidity) per manufacturer’s instructions. Biotinylated FcRs were tagged with PE and added to
immune complexes. Fluorescence was acquired using an Intellicyt iQue, and relative antigenspecific antibody titer and FcR binding is reported as Median Fluorescence Intensity (MFI).

Univariate statistical analysis
For univariate data analysis, statistics were run using GraphPad Prism version 8.0. For functional
assays, univariate analysis was performed comparing the three groups of women within each
timepoint. Significance was determined by an ordinary one-way ANOVA for each antigen, with
post-hoc Šídák's multiple comparisons test for the reported adjusted p values. For Luminex
assays, A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. For comparisons between mother
and either cord or breastmilk, Wilcoxon-matched pairs signed rank test was performed. To
determine transfer ratios the cord serum or breastmilk value was divided by the respective
mother’s value for each assay.

Multivariate analysis
Multivariate analyses were performed in R (version 4.0.0) and Python (version 3.9.1). The data
was then centered and scaled. For principal component analysis (PCA), an unsupervised
dimensionality reduction technique, data was log10-transformed prior to centering and scaling.

For classification models, LASSO feature selection was performed using the “select_lasso”
function in systemseRology R package (v1.0) (https://github.com/LoosC/systemsseRology).
LASSO selection was performed 100 times, and only features that were chosen in 80% of the
repetitions were used to build the downstream models. Partial least squares discriminant analysis
(PLSDA) was performed using the LASSO-selected features. Multilevel partial least squares
discriminant analysis (mPLSDA) (50) was performed for classification of maternal and cord
samples. Model performance was evaluated by five-fold cross-validation. To evaluate model
robustness, control models with permuted classifier labels or with random features were built 50
times. These control models were then cross-validated 10 times to determine model accuracy. P
values were calculated as the probability that the true value was within the control distributions.
For correlation networks, antibody features that had Bonferroni-adjusted p-values < 0.05 and a
spearman |r|>0.75 were visualized within the networks.

A. A PCA was built on the SARS-CoV-2-specific features at V1 (purple) and V2 (blue) in
lactating women. The ellipses represent the 95% confidence interval for each group. The
heatmaps show the contribution of each feature along each principal component (PC). The color
of the heatmap indicates in which group each feature is enriched.
B. A PCA was built on the SARS-CoV-2-specific features in breastmilk at V1 (purple) and V2
(blue), using time point as the outcome variable. The ellipses represent the 95% confidence
interval for each timepoint. The heatmap shows the contribution of each feature to the
corresponding PC.
C. The polar plots show the mean percentile rank for each feature for V1 or V2 in the serum of
lactating women. The color of the heatmap indicates in which group each feature is enriched.
D. The polar plots show the mean percentile rank for each feature for V1 or V2 in breastmilk.
E. The dot plot shows the transfer ratio (breastmilk/serum) for each isotype (left) and FcR (right)
measured at V1. Significance was determined by a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s
multiple comparison correction. * p <0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001.

A. A LASSO-PLSDA model was built on V2 data from all groups. The dot plot (top) shows the
scores for each sample, with each dot representing a sample. The ellipses represent the 95%
confidence interval for each group. The bar plot (bottom) shows the loadings of each LASSOselected feature, where the color marks the group enrichment.
B. The violin plots show differences in the top LASSO-selected features from Figure 4A in nonpregnant, pregnant and lactating women given either the Moderna (M, filled dots) or Pfizer/
BioNtech (P, outline dots). All data in the violin plots is from V2. Significance was only
calculated between groups in the same time point and was determined by a one-way ANOVA
with followed by posthoc Šidák’s multiple comparison test. * p <0.05, ** p < 0.01,*** p <
0.001, **** p < 0.0001.
C. The heatmaps show the spearman correlation between features for women who received the
Moderna (top) or Pfizer (bottom) vaccine. For isotypes and FcγR-binding, the features are
ordered as Spike, S2, S1, and RBD. For functional data, only functional activity against Spike
was measured.
D. A LASSO-PLSDA model was built on V2 breastmilk data. The dot plot (top) shows the
scores for each sample, with each dot representing a sample. The ellipses represent the 95%
confidence interval for each group. The bar plot (bottom) shows the loadings of each LASSOselected feature, where the color marks the group enrichment.
