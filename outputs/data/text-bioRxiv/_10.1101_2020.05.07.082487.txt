Abstract

29

Background. Epidemiological, virological and pathogenetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are

30

under evaluation. A better understanding of the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 is crucial to

31

improve treatment modalities and to develop effective prevention strategies. Transcriptomic and proteomic

32

data on the host response against SARS-CoV-2 still have anecdotic character; currently available data from

33

other coronavirus infections are therefore a key source of information.

34

Methods. We investigated selected molecular aspects of three human coronavirus (HCoV) infections,

35

namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, through a network based-approach. A functional analysis

36

of HCoV-host interactome was carried out in order to provide a theoretic host-pathogen interaction model for

37

HCoV infections and in order to translate the results in prediction for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

38

The 3D model of S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the structure of the corresponding SARS-

39

CoV, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV S-glycoprotein. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and the host

40

interactome were inferred through published protein-protein interactions (PPI) as well as gene co-expression,

41

triggered by HCoV S-glycoprotein in host cells.

42

Results. Although the amino acid sequences of the S-glycoprotein were found to be different between the

43

various HCoV, the structures showed high similarity, but the best 3D structural overlap shared by SARS-

44

CoV and SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the shared ACE2 predicted receptor. The host interactome, linked to

45

the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mainly highlighted innate immunity pathway

46

components, such as Toll Like receptors, cytokines and chemokines.

47

Conclusions. In this paper, we developed a network-based model with the aim to define molecular aspects of

48

pathogenic phenotypes in HCoV infections. The resulting pattern may facilitate the process of structure-

49

guided pharmaceutical and diagnostic research with the prospect to identify potential new biological targets.

Background

55

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified as a zoonotic pathogen of

56

humans in Wuhan, China, causing a respiratory infection with associated bilateral interstitial pneumonia.

57

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named by the World Health Organization as COVID-19 and it has

58

been classified as a global pandemic since it has spread rapidly to all continents. As of March 30, 2020, there

59

have been 634 835 confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide with 29 957 deaths reported to the WHO [1].

60

Whilst clinical and epidemiological data on COVID-19 have become readily available, information on the

61

pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been forthcoming [2].The transcriptomic and proteomic

62

data on host response against SARS-CoV-2 is scanty and not effective therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-

63

19 are available yet.

64

Coronaviruses (CoVs) typically affect the respiratory tract of mammals, including humans, and lead to mild

65

to severe respiratory tract infections [3]. Many emerging HCoV infections have spilled-over from animal

66

reservoirs, such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E which cause mild diseases such as common colds [4, 5].

67

During the past 2 decades, two highly pathogenic HCoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

68

(SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have led to global epidemics

69

with high morbidity and mortality [6]. In this period, a large amount of experimental data associated with the

70

two infections has allowed to better understand molecular mechanism(s) of coronavirus infection, and

71

enhance pathways for developing new drugs, diagnostics and vaccines and identification of host factors

72

stimulating (proviral factors) or restricting (antiviral factors) infection remains poorly understood [7].

73

Structures of many proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and biological interactions with other viral and

74

host proteins have been widely explored; through experimental testing of small molecule inhibitors with anti-

75

viral effects [8, 9]. ACE2, expressed in type 2 alveolar cells in the lung, has been identified as receptor of

76

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, while dipeptidyl peptidase DPP4 was identified as the specific receptor for

77

MERS-CoV [10, 11].

78

The investigation of structural genomics and interactomics of SARS-CoV-2 can be implemented through an

79

integrated bioinformatics approach. Structural analysis of specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins, in particular Spike

80

glycoproteins (S-glycoproteins), and their interactions with human proteins, can guide the identification of

81

the putative functional sites and help to better define the pathologic phenotype of the infection. This

82

functional interaction analysis between the host and other HCoVs, combined with an evolutionary sequence

83

analysis of SARS-CoV-2, can be used to guide new treatment and prevention interventions.

84

We investigated here biologically and clinically relevant molecular targets of three human coronaviruses

85

(HCoV) infections using a network based approach. A functional analysis of HCoV-host interactome was

86

carried out in order to provide a theoretic host-pathogen interaction model for HCoV infections, and to

87

predict viable models for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Three HCoV causing respiratory diseases were used as

88

the model targets, namely: SARS-CoV, that shares with SARS-CoV-2 a strong genetic similarity, including

89

MERS-CoV, and HCoV-229E.

90
91

Methods

92

Comparative reconstruction of S-glycoprotein in HCoVs

93

The reconstruction of virus-host interactome was carried out using the RWR algorithm to explore the human

94

PPI network and the multilayer PPI platform enriched with gene expression data sets. 259 sequences of

95

CoVs, infecting different animal hosts (Table S1 in Additional file 1), were downloaded by GSAID and

96

NCBI database in order to evaluate the variability in the S gene. SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV

97

and other CoV full genome sequence groups were aligned with MAFFT [12], synonymous and non-

98

synonymous mutations, and amino acid similarity were calculated using the SSE program with a sliding

99

windows of 250 nucleotides and a pass of 25 nu [13]. A homology model was built for the amino acid

100

sequences of the S-glycoprotein, derived from the full genome sequence obtained at “SARS-CoV-

101

2/INMI1/human/2020/ITA” (MT066156.1). The Swiss pdb server was used to construct three-dimensional

102

models for the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 [14]. Among proteins with a 3D structure, the best match

103

with the “SARS-CoV-2/INMI1/human/2020/ITA” sequence was the 6VSB.1, that was evaluated considering

104

the identity of two amino acid sequences and the QMEN value included in Swiss pdb server. The model of a

105

single chain was overlapped with the three-dimensional structure of S-glycoprotein single chain belonging to

106

SARS-CoV (5WRG), HCoV-229E (6U7H.1) and MERS-CoV (5X59), using Chimera 1.14 [15]. In order to

107

better evaluate the conservation of the sequence in each site, all sequences were aligned with MAFFT and

108

the topology of all structures were compared. The detailed description of the reconstruction of S-

109

glycoprotein structure is reported in the Appendix.

110
111

PPI and Gene Co-expression Network

112

Network analysis, based on protein-protein interactions and gene expression data, was performed in order to

113

view all possible virus-host protein interactions during the HCoV infections. Since the SARS-CoV-2 genome

114

exhibits substantial similarity to the SARS-CoV genome [16] and subsequently also the proteome [17], we

115

hypothesized that several molecular interactions that were observed in the SARS-CoV interactome will be

116

preserved in the SARS-CoV-2 interactome. Virus-Host interactomes (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-

117

229E) were inferred through published PPI data, using two publicly accessible databases (STRING Viruses

118

and VirHostNet), as well as published scientific reports with a focus on virus-host interactions [18-20]. As a

119

next step, the virus-host PPI list, extracted in this first step, was merged with additional PPI databases, i.e.

120

BioGrid, InnateDB-All, IMEx, IntAct, MatrixDB, MBInfo, MINT, Reactome, Reactome-FIs, UniProt,

121

VirHostNet, BioData, CCSB Interactome Database, using R packages PSICQUIC and biomaRt [21, 22]. In

122

total, a large PPI interaction database was assembled, including 13,020 nodes and 71,496 interactions.

123

The gene expression data set was built from the Protein Atlas database, using tissue and cell line data [23].

124

To identify the most likely interactions, and to obtain functional information, Random walk with restart

125

(RWR), a state-of-the-art guilt-by-association approach by R package RandomWalkRestartMH [24] was

126

used. It allows to establish a proximity network from a given protein (seed), to study its functions, based on

127

the premise that nodes related to similar functions tend to lie close to each other in the network. For each

128

node, a score was computed as measure of proximity to the seed protein. S-glycoproteins of SARS-CoV,

129

MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E were used as seed in the application of the RWR algorithm.

130
131

Functional Enrichment Analysis

132

To evaluate functional pathways of proteins involved in host response, gene enrichment analysis was

133

performed, using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) human pathways and Gene Ontology

134

databases. Network representation from the gene enrichment analysis was performed using ShinyGO

135

v0.61[25]. The statistical significance was obtained, calculating the False Discovery Rate (FDR).

Results

137

Structure of S-glycoprotein CoVs

138

To evaluate the diversity along the full genome, pairwise distance was calculated on 259 HCoV genomes.

139

Diversity was distributed along the entire CoV genome, with the most conserved region located in Orf1ab, as

140

expected, while the spike gene region exhibited a rather high diversity (Figure S1 in Appendix).

141

Consequently, the analysis was focused on the S-glycoprotein, as a key virus component involved in host

142

interaction [26]. A 3D model of S-glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence (MT066156.1) was built on

143

the sequence obtained at Laboratory of Virology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases "L. Spallanzani"

144

IRCCS, using Swiss pdb viewer server (Figure S2 a/b in Appendix). The SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein

145

structure was then compared to other HCoVs as shown in Figure S2 in Appendix. The S-glycoprotein

146

structures of the various HCoV were very similar overall. In particular, a strong similarity was shown in the

147

RBD (nCov: residues 319−591) [27], and this was most evident for the comparison between SARS-CoV-2

148

and SARS-CoV, which share the same cell receptor (ACE2). The amino acid differences among the S-

149

glycoproteins of the selected HCoVs (SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E) are shown in

150

Figure S3 in Appendix, where a lower topology similarity was observed with HCoV-229E S-glycoprotein,

151

which binds a different host receptor.

152

Overall, the pattern arising from such comparison was consistent with specific host receptors, as well as with

153

different host reservoirs and ancestry [28].

154
155

Human CoV and host interactome

156

An interactome map was built to highlight biological connections among S-glycoprotein and the human

157

proteome. Using the analysis pipeline described in the methods, a large PPI interaction database was

158

assembled, including 13,020 nodes and 71,496 interactions between human host and the three selected

159

viruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E).

160

The interactome reconstruction was obtained with the RWR analysis, finding 200 closest proteins to seed, or

161

S-glycoproteins of HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figures S4-S6 in Appendix). In Table S2, S3

162

and S4 in Additional file 1, lists of genes selected by RWR algorithm for HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV and

163

MERS-CoV, along with proximity score were reported. In order to further dissect the S-glycoprotein-host

164

interactions, enrichment analysis was carried out with Reactome and KEGG databases. Reactome pathway

165

enrichment analysis revealed biological pathways of DNA repair, transcription and gene regulation for the

166

HCoV-229E S-glycoprotein, with high significance (FDR <0.01%). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis

167

revealed ubiquitin mediated proteolysis as the most significant pathway (FDR <0.01%), as well as altered

168

cellular proliferation pathways, associated with other viral infections (Hepatitis B, measles, Epstein-Barr

169

virus infection and Human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection) as well as with carcinogenesis (Figure 1). Next,

170

the RWR algorithm was applied to a multilayer network built on the PPI interactome and on the Gene

171

Coexpression (COEX) network, again with S-glycoprotein of HCoV-229E as seed. The results highlighted a

172

set of genes that are connected in both PPI and COEX analysis, including ANPEP, RAD18, APEX, POLH,

173

APEX1, TERF2, RAD51, CDC7, USP7, XRCC5, RAD18, FEN1, PCNA, all associated to the GO biological

174

process category of DNA repair (FDR< 0.0001%) (Figure 2). The same analyses were conducted for SARS-

175

CoV and MERS-CoV.

176
177

The Reactome pathway enrichment analysis for the SARS-CoV revealed S-glycoprotein connection with

178

early activation of innate immune system, such as the Toll Like Receptor Cascade and TGF-β, with a strong

179

significance (FDR < 0.0001%), while the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed an association with

180

cellular proliferation, TGF-β and other infection-related pathways (FDR<0.0001%) (Figure 3). The PPI-

181

COEX multilayer analysis highlighted a set of genes that are connected in both PPI and COEX analysis,

182

i.e.CLEC4G, CLEC4M, CD209, ACE2, RPSA, all associated to the GO biological process category of

183

SARS-CoV entry into host cell (FDR < 0.01%) (Figure 4).

184
185
186
187

In MERS-CoV, the Reactome pathway enrichment analysis showed a strong association with membrane

188

signals activated by GPCR ligand binding (FDR < 0.0001%), and chemokine/chemokine receptor pathways.

189

Consistent results were obtained with KEGG pathway enrichment, that highlighted cytokine-cytokine

190

receptor and chemokine signalling pathways (FDR<0.0001%) (Figure 5). Finally, PPI-COEX multilayer

191

analysis evidenced, for both PPI and COEX, CCR4, CXCL2, CXCL10, CXCL9, PF4, PF4V1, CCL11,

CXCL11, XCL1, CXCR4 and CXCL14, all genes identified by the GO biological processes involved in the

195

Discussion

196

In-depth comparative analysis of S-glycoprotein

197

We applied network analysis, based on protein-protein interactions and gene expression data, in order to

198

describe the interactome of the coronavirus S-glycoprotein and host proteins, with the aim to better

199

understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. A preliminary structural analysis was conducted on the S-

200

glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to the other 3 HCoV, using the S-glycoprotein as a model to shed

201

light on the host-pathogen interaction in the dynamic process of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although the amino

202

acid sequences of the S-glycoprotein were different between the various HCoVs, the structural analysis

203

exhibited high similarity; the best 3D structural overlap was found for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,

204

consistent with the shared ACE2 predicted receptor.

205

Of note, the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 genome has revealed differences between SARS-CoV-2 and

206

SARS or SARS-like coronaviruses [28]. Although no amino acid substitutions were present in the receptor-

207

binding motifs, that directly interact with human receptor ACE2 protein in SARS-CoV, six mutations

208

occurred in the other region of the RBD [28, 29] were identified. On the other hand, the genomic

209

comparative analysis highlighted the a strong diversity in the S gene among CoV in different hosts,

210

confirming the biologically vital role of the S-glycoprotein as a key factor in viral entry in cross-species

211

transmission events [30].

212

In addition, the comparative 3D structural data may facilitate the definition of already known antibody

213

epitopes in the S-glycoprotein of other coronaviruses, it will also be useful in rational vaccine design and in

214

gauging anti-virus directed immune responses after vaccination [27]. In fact, S-glycoprotein remains an

215

important target for vaccines and drugs. previously evaluated in SARS and MERS, while a neutralizing

216

antibody targeting the S-glycoprotein protein could provide passive immunity. The host interactome, linked

217

to S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mainly highlighted innate immunity pathway components,

218

such as Toll Like receptors, cytokines and chemokines. The 3D structural analysis confirmed that we

219

established that S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has strong similarity in the 3D structure with SARS-CoV

220

[16].

221
222
223

Host interactome in all three HCoV infections

224

The reconstruction of virus-host interactome was carried out using RWR algorithm to explore the human PPI

225

network and studying PPI and COEX multilayer. The PPI network topology of host interactome in all three

226

infections indicated the presence of several hub proteins. In the HCoV-229E - host interactome hub position

227

was hold by RAD18 and APEX, which play an important role in DNA repair due to UV damage in phase S

228

[31].

229

For the SARS-CoV interactome, the gene hubs were identified in ACE2,CLEC4G and CD209, which are

230

known interactors with S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV[32, 33].

231

In fact, two independent mechanisms were described as trigger of SARS-CoV infection: proteolytic cleavage

232

of ACE2 and cleavage of S-glycoprotein. The latter activates the glycoprotein for cathepsin L-independent

233

host cell entry. Activated the S-glycoprotein by cathepsin L mechanism in host cell entry was reported in

234

many infection of CoV, such as HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV [34, 35]. A recent study speculated that this

235

interaction will be preserved in SARS-CoV-2 [17], but might be disrupted of a substantial number of

236

mutations in the receptor binding site of S gene will occur. Likewise, the S-glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2 is

237

expected to interact with type II transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) and probably is involved in inhibition

238

of antibody-mediated neutralization [36, 37]. It is rather unexpected that, for this virus, no intracellular

239

pathways were highlighted by the multilayer analysis, suggesting that this field is still open to further

240

investigation.

241

In MERS-CoV infection a gene hub role was described for DPP4, which is known to regulate cytokine levels

242

through catalytic cleavage [38]. Immune cell–recruiting chemokines and cytokines, such as IP-10/CXCL-10,

243

MCP-1/CCL-2, MIP-1α/CCL-3, RANTES/CCL-5, can be strongly induced by MERS-CoV, showing higher

244

inducibility in human monocyte–derived macrophages by MERS-CoV as compared to than SARS-CoV

245

infection [39].

246

Finally, biological pathways, revealed by enrichment analysis in over all models, supported early activation

247

of innate immune system, as Toll Like receptor Cascade and TGF-β for SARS-CoV, or chemokine and

248

cytokine pathways and infection-related pathways for MERS-CoV, with a strong significance for both.

249
250
251

Pathogenic model for HCoV infections

252

We constructed a host molecular interactome with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E in patients

253

with cancer, assuming that most of these interactions, especially for SARS-CoV, are shared with SARS-

254

CoV-2. A network-based methodology, along with guilt-by-association algorithm (RWR), was applied to

255

define the pathological model of COVID-19 and provide a treatment of SARS-CoV-2, using existing

256

transcriptomic and proteomic information.

257

Based on the main pathways identified by the network-based interactome analysis, the following issues

258

require focus further study:

259

First, The predicted receptor for SARS-CoV-2 has been inferred to be ACE-2, i.e. the same used by SARS-

260

CoV, based on the high similarity of the S-glycoprotein of the two viruses, and this is the basis for

261

hypothesizing to use SARS-CoV as a model for virus-host interactome in COVID-19;

262

Second, Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a major cell signalling pathway that is known to be

263

activated by diverse groups of viruses, and plays an important role in cellular response to viral infections.

264

MAPK interacting kinase 1 (MNK1) has been shown to regulate both cap-dependent and internal ribosomal

265

entry sites (IRES)-mediated mRNA translation;

266

Third, The identification of the MAPK pathway in SARS-CoV model is highly consistent with in vivo

267

model, where P38 MAPK was found increased in the lungs of mice infected with SARS-CoV [40];

268

Fourth, The identification of the TGF-β pathway in S-glycoprotein-induced interactome for SARS-CoV of

269

particular interest, due to the previous evidence that this virus, and in particular its protease, triggered the

270

TGF-β through the p38 MAPK/STAT3 pathway in alveolar basal epithelial cells [41, 42];

271

Fifth, Innate immune pathways were identified in S-glycoprotein-induced models of SARS-CoV and

272

273

Every described pathway can be matched with clinical aspects, the data presented in this report may

274

therefore aid to design a ‘blue print’ for SARS-CoV-2 associated pathogenicity.

275

The severity and the clinical picture of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections could be related to the

276

activation of exaggerated immune mechanism, causing uncontrolled inflammation [43]; however, the role of

277

strong immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection severity is still uncertain.

278

However, we may consider that host kinases link multiple signalling pathways in response to a broad array

279

of stimuli, including viral infections. TGF-β, produced during the inflammatory phase by macrophages, is an

280

important mediator of fibroblast activation and tissue repair. High levels of systemic inflammatory

281

cytokines/chemokines has been widely reported for MERS-CoV infections [44-46], correlating with

282

immunopathology and massive pulmonary infiltration into the lungs [47]. Also the HCoV-229E infection

283

can be described with this distance model, although this infection was not associated with a severe

284

respiratory disease. In fact, HCoV-229E is responsible for mild upper respiratory tract infections, such as

285

common colds, with only occasional spreading to the lower respiratory tract, but it interacts with dendritic

286

cells in the upper respiratory tract, inducing a cytopathic effect [48].

Conclusions

291

In conclusion, we developed a network-based model, which could be the framework for structure-guided

292

research process and for the pathogenetic evaluation of specific clinical outcome. Accurate structural 3D

293

protein models and their interaction with host receptor proteins can allow to build a more detailed theoretical

294

disease model for each HCoV infection, and support the drawing of a disease model for COVID-19. Our

295

analyses suggests it is important to carry out in silico experiments and simulations through specific

296

algorithms.

A single protein, namely S-glycoprotein was used as seed, therefore the highlighted interactions were limited

300

to those connected with this unique viral protein. However, this is a proof of concept study, from which it

301

appears that a similar approach may be used to study other viral proteins interacting with host cell pathways.

302

Another limitation is that the pathway analysis did not consider tissue and cell type diversity. Finally, the low

303

threshold established for the number of nodes found by RWR (200) limited the reconstruction of the entire

304

pathways. However, this was a software-imposed threshold.

305

In summary, the interactome analysis aided to guide the design of novel models of SARS-CoV

306

pathogenicity.
