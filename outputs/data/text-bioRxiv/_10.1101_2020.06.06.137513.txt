Abstract

33

The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to an urgent

34

need to develop therapeutic interventions. Among them, neutralizing antibodies play

35

crucial roles for preventing viral infections and contribute to resolution of infection.

36

Here, we describe the generation of antibody libraries from 17 different COVID-19

37

recovered patients and screening of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. After 3

38

rounds of panning, 456 positive phage clones were obtained with high affinity to RBD

39

(receptor binding domain). Then the positive clones were sequenced and

40

reconstituted into whole human IgG for epitope binning assays. After that, all 19 IgG

41

were classified into 6 different epitope groups or Bins. Although all these antibodies

42

were shown to have ability to bind RBD, the antibodies in Bin2 have more superiority

43

to inhibit the interaction between spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme 2

44

receptor (ACE2). Most importantly, the antibodies from Bin2 can also strongly bind

45

with mutant RBDs (W463R, R408I, N354D, V367F and N354D/D364Y) derived from

46

SARS-CoV-2 strain with increased infectivity, suggesting the great potential of these

47

antibodies in preventing infection of SARS-CoV-2 and its mutations. Furthermore,

48

these neutralizing antibodies strongly restrict the binding of RBD to hACE2

49

overexpressed 293T cells. Consistently, these antibodies effectively neutralized

50

pseudovirus entry into hACE2 overexpressed 293T cells. In Vero-E6 cells, these

51

antibodies can even block the entry of live SARS-CoV-2 into cells at only 12.5 nM.

52

These results suggest that these neutralizing human antibodies from the

53

patient-derived antibody libraries have the potential to become therapeutic agents

Introduction

58

A newly emerged pathogen spreading worldwide named severe acute respiratory

59

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now causing a pandemic and is

60

responsible for more than 5,300,000 cases and 340,000 death. This global pandemic

61

threatens public health greatly than ever before. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to

62

Sarbecovirus subgenus and shares substantial genetic and functional similarity with

63

other pathogenic human betacoronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory

64

Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome

65

Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)

66

international transmission of SARS-CoV-2 make it become the most infectious and

67

destructive coronavirus than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV

68

vaccines or therapeutic drugs that are effective and specific to SARS-CoV-2 and its

69

mutants are urgent need to stop the pandemic.

70

Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes its envelope spike (S) glycoprotein for

71

interaction with a cellular receptor for entry into the target cell. Angiotensin converting

72

enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the main receptor for viral entry through

73

triggering a cascade of cell membrane fusion events 6. The spike glycoprotein is

74

composed of two functional subunits responsible for binding to the host cell receptor

75

(S1 subunit) and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (S2 subunit). And the host

76

range and cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 are determinated by the receptor-binding

77

domain (RBD) within the S1 subunit 7. Although the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into

78

susceptible cells is a complex process and need to be further explored, the

79

receptor-binding and proteolytic processing of the S protein are regarded as the key

80

events in promoting virus-cell fusion. Whereas, more and more RBD mutants have

81

been found under high positive selection pressure during the spread. The fact that

82

these mutations increased the SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to its host receptor ACE2

83

reveals a higher risk of more severe infections during a sustained pandemic of

84

COVID-19 8. Thus, common neutralization of interaction between ACE2 and RBD with

85

different mutations could serve as promising candidates for prophylactic and

86

therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2 infection 9.

87

During the last epidemic, SARS patients benefits a lot from convalescent serum

developed to get full human antibodies. Among them, phage display library facilitates

96

the identification and development of specific affinity antibodies in a rapid and

cost-effective manner. Several full human antibodies against the S1 domain have

101

from 18 different COVID-19 recovered patients. Then several neutralizing human

102

antibodies were identified and characterized with the ability to bind with different RBD

103

and its mutants (R408I, W463R, N354D, V367F and N354D/D364Y) and block the

104

interaction with hACE2. Finally, these antibodies dramatically inhibited SARS-CoV-2

105

RBD mediated entry into cells using both pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2 virus,

106

indicating that patient-derived phage display antibody libraries could be an attractive

107

source of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and these antibodies are specific

prophylactic and therapeutic agents against ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

111

Generation of Patient-derived antibody library

112

As the source of therapeutic antibodies to COVID-19, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 B cells

113

were enriched obvioulsy in COVID-19 convalescent patients. Thus, the PBMC from

114

18 different COVID-19 recovered patients were isolated to generate phage displayed

115

scFv libraries for panning the neutralizing antibodies (Figure 1A). Prior to construct

116

the phage display library, we examined the binding ability of plasma from 18

117

recovered COVID-19 patients to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that most of these

118

convalescent patients were able to produce high titer of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific

119

antibodies and only three patients mounted relatively lower anti-RBD IgG responses

120

when compared with health donor by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

121

(Fig. 1B). Then, the phage display libraries from 17 patients were constructed

122

respectively and quality assessment of each library was undertaken by RT-PCR clone

123

counting and phage display ELISA. The correlation between the size of an antibody

124

library and the likelihood of selecting for the desired antibodies is somewhat intuitive.

125

As shown in Figure 1C, the capacity of primary library from each patient is between

126

1.01×107 to 1.43×108 which is consistent with other immunized scFv library 15. And the

127

total capacity of whole library is more than 109. Ideally, the size of a library should be

128

equal to its effective size, meaning that all the 109 antibody variants comprising the

129

library are displayed as functional scFv molecules on the phage surface. Whereas,

130

the quality of gene amplification by RT-PCR affects the effective size of the libraries.

131

So, we appraised the positive rate and scFv frequency of each library by PCR and

132

phage display ELISA. Sequence analysis revealed that the framework region (FR)

133

and complementarity determining region (CDR) of selected clones showed the

134

greatest difference in amino acid sequences and the mean positive rate is 95.83%

135

and 88.38% (Figure 1D&E). Taken together, our data revealed that the scFv library

136

from COVID-19 recovered patients were constructed successfully.

137
138

Panning against SARS-CoV-2 RBD

139

Affinity selection of the patient-derived antibody library was performed using

140

solid-phase-bound RBD. After three rounds of panning, 1728 phage clones were

141

randomly picked out to induce the expression of soluble scFv for binding assay by

142

ELISA. As shown in Figure 2A, there are 456 positive clones were identified to bind

143

with RBD specifically. Then, 19 scFv clones with highest affinity to RBD were

144

reconstituted into whole human IgG for functional assay. In order to characterize and

145

group these IgG by the epitope binding regions generated against RBD, the “epitope

146

binning” assay was performed on Octet systems. As shown in Figure 2B, 19 IgG can

147

be divided into 6 different Bins. Among them, Bin1 and Bin2 are biggest groups with

148

14 and 16 clones suggested that these two epitopes on RBD are most important for

149

recognizing by humoral immune system. So, engineering antibody that targets a

150

specific functioning epitope on an RBD is more important than finding high-affinity,

151

tight-binding mAb, because affinity maturation is a mature and cost-effective

152

technique.

153
154

In vitro binding assay to RBD

155

To further confirm the binding affinity of each IgG in Bin1 and Bin2, the RBD was

156

bound in 96-well plates to do IgG binding assay. Consistent with scFv binding assay

157

(data not shown)，the IgG in both Bin1 and Bin2 have similar binding affinity to RBD

158

(Figure 3A&B). As the main step for SARS-CoV-2 entry to the host cells, the

159

interaction between spike and ACE2 is crucial to the viral infection. And the blocking

160

of this interaction by neutralizing antibody have great potential in treating COVID-19.

161

Thus, we sought to investigate whether these IgG can block the binding of RBD to

162

hACE2 overexpressed 293T cells by FACS inhibition assay. As shown in Figure 3C&D,

163

all the IgG in Bin1 and Bin2 have the ability to block the binding of RBD to hACE2

164

overexpressed 293T cells. Whereas, some IgG in Bin2 group have superior effective

165

blockade of RBD binding to hACE2 cells, suggesting that the epitope of Bin2 is more

166

critical to the infection of SARS-CoV-2 to the host cells. To further confirm this

167

hypothesis, the top 4 IgG in Bin2 were picked out for further study. Although the

168

SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS, the amino acid sequence of RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is

169

only about 74% homologous to that of SARS-CoV. So, we used the IgG specific to

170

SARS (CR3022) as a control to do the functional assay. We demonstrated that all the

171

IgG including HTS0422, HTS0433, HTS0446, HTS0483 and CR3022 bind to RBD

172

specifically (Figure 3E). Whereas, only the four IgG (HTS0422, HTS0433, HTS0446

173

and HTS0483) from Bin2 could inhibit the interaction between RBD and hACE2

174

(Figure 3F), suggesting that the binding epitope of these IgG is crucial to the

175

SARS-CoV-2 infection.

176
177

Cross-neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations

178

As an RNA virus, mutations in SARS-CoV-2 is commonly found in different countries.

179

Previous studies demonstrated that the mutations in RBD enhanced the binding

180

affinity to the host cells. Therefore, cross-neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 RBD

181

mutations is essential to develop an effective therapeutic antibody. In this study, five

182

different SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants (R408I, W463R, N354D, V367F and

183

N354D/D364Y) from different strains found in India, Wuhan, Hong Kong, and

184

Shenzhen, respectively, were obtained from ACRO BIOSYSTEMS. As shown in

185

Figure 4A, HTS0422, HTS0433 and HTS0446 bind with both wildtype and mutant

186

(W463R, N354D, V367F, both N354D and D364Y) RBD significantly. Whereas, only

187

HTS0483 bind with R408I, a mutant strain from India, suggesting that R408 is

188

essential for the binding of HTS0422, HTS0433 and HTS0446, and mutations at R408

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.06.137513; this version posted June 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

189

abolished the binding of antibodies to the virus RBD. And HTS0483 may have broader

190

cross-neutralization effect against SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations. Accordingly, only

191

HTS0483 inhibit the binding between ACE2 and all RBD mutants including W436R

192

and R408I. Whereas, the antibodies (HTS0422, HTS0433 and HTS0446) can restrict

193

the interaction between ACE2 and wildtype, N354D, V367F or N354D/D364Y (Figure

194

4B), implying that the mutations at W436R and R408I in RBD may cause immune

195

ignorance by humoral immune response in convalescent patients.

196
197

Antiviral properties of human antibodies

198

To explore the potential of these top four IgG as therapeutic drugs, we tested whether

199

these IgG can block the binding of RBD to hACE2 expressed cells by flow cytometry

200

analysis. We found that these top four IgG from Bin2 could restrict the binding of RBD

201

to hACE2-293T cells but not CR3022 which bind to both SARS and SARS-CoV-2

202

RBD (Figure 5A). Furthermore, we determined the neutralization ability of these four

203

IgG (HTS0422, HTS0433, HTS0446 and HTS0483) using a SARS-CoV-2 S

204

pseudotyped lentiviral particle. Consistent with ELISA and FACS-based blockade

205

result, all these 4 antibodies effectively neutralized pseudovirus entry to host cells

206

ectopically expressing hACE2, with EC50 from 12.80 nM to 16.54nM (Figure 5B&C).

207

Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 strain hCoV-19/Hangzhou/ZJU-05/2020 was obtained to

208

do the live virus neutralization assay. As shown in Figure 5D, these four IgG from Bin2

209

inhibit the infection of SARS-CoV-2 significantly at 12.5nM. Finally, authentic infection

210

of Vero-E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 was neutralized with these IgG antibodies with

211

IC50 from 12.5 nM to 50 nM (Figure 5E), suggesting that these neutralizing antibodies

212

can effectively inhibit infection of the virus to host cells by targeting to the epitope on

213

RBD, and these antibodies are potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of

214

COVID-19.

215
216

Discussion

217

Although different approaches have been performed to develop the therapeutic

218

antibodies for infectious diseases, phage display library still persist as the common

219

method for generation of recombinant antibodies against various targets for

220

biomedical applications and research

221

antibodies discovered via phage display were approved by the Food and Drug

222

Administration (FDA)

223

human scFv libraries from 17 different COVID-19 recovered patients to get the

224

neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Four human antibodies with similar

225

binding epitope were identified to have the potential as a therapeutic antibody for

226

treating COVID-19. Among them, the clone HTS0483 may have broader

227

cross-neutralization against not only wildtype SARS-CoV-2 RBD but also four other

228

mutations.

229

Similar with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 use the homotrimeric spike

230

glycoprotein (comprising a S1 subunit and S2 subunit in each spike monomer) on the

231

envelope to bind to their cellular receptors ACE2. Previous study demonstrated that

232

the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins with ACE2 induces

16

. Till to now, up to 9 fully human therapeutic

17

. In this study, we constructed different phage displayed

233

the dissociation of the S1 with ACE2, prompting the S2 to transit from a metastable

234

235

19

236

component within the S1 subunit and is responsible for binding of SARS-CoV-2 by

237

ACE2

238

RBD and ACE2 has identified some residues that are potentially involved in the

239

interaction, the actual residues involved in the interaction remained unclear. Thus, we

240

cloned the receptor binding domain in S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins

241

as a target for panning neutralizing antibodies from patient-derived antibody libraries.

242

Although more than 400 positive clones were identified to bind with RBD by ELISA

243

assay, only part of them could block the interaction between RBD and ACE2

244

significantly, suggesting that not all epitopes in the RBD involved in binding with ACE2.

245

So, we sorted panel of selected antibodies according to epitope specificities by

246

epitope binning assay. The more antibodies that are analyzed for cross-blocking in a

247

pairwise and combinatorial manner against their specific antigen, the higher the

248

probability of discriminating their epitopes. There are 6 different bins were identified,

249

but most antibodies were divided into Bin1 and Bin2. Then we measured the binding

250

affinity and blocking ability of each antibody in Bin1 and Bin2. We demonstrated that

251

the antibodies in Bin1 and Bin2 have similar binding affinity to RBD. However, the

252

neutralizing or blocking ability of antibodies in Bin2 is much better than in Bin1,

253

suggesting that the epitope of Bin2 is essential for ACE2 binding. Therefore, if we can

254

make some point mutation in RBD to explore the binding motif of antibodies in Bin2,

. Furthermore, in vitro measurements indicate that the RBD is a key functional

. Although computer modelling of the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2

255

the actual residues that mediate the interaction between RBD and ACE2 will be

discovered.

257

Till to now, 32 RBD mutant strains were identified in the strains all around the world

258

and some of them have been proven to increase the infectivity. In addition, the S

259

protein is also important for antigen cognition. Thus, the variation of S protein may

260

change the antigen of virus and influence the vaccine immune efficiency. Therefore,

261

the neutralization antibodies against more SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations will have

262

better potential in clinical application. In this study, although 4 antibodies are all from

263

Bin2, the binding motif is identical to each other. For example, only HTS0483 binds

264

with R408I mutant in RBD, suggesting that the binding of HTS0483 to RBD is

265

independent of R481. Furthermore, only HTS0483 can block the binding of both

266

W436R and R408I mutants to ACE2 implied that the mutation in RBD may cause the

267

escape of SARS-COV-2 from humoral immune responses. Interestingly, the mutation

268

W436R and R408I are isolated from Wuhan and India respectively. Whereas, the

269

recovered patients are all from Zhejiang province without the mutation in RBD.

270

Therefore, the convalescent patients or vaccine immunized people without the

271

antibody like HTS0483 may still have chance to be infected by the SARS-COV-2 with

272

W436R and R408I mutation. This could be the big challenge to develop effective

273

vaccine against to COVID-19.

274

Some evidences have shown that the convalescent serum from a patient with a

275

SARS-CoV infection and horse anti-SARS-CoV serum could cross-neutralize the

276

infection of SARS-CoV-2, implied that the structure of RBDs in SARS-CoV-2 and

277

278

little cross-binding and neutralization activity against spike protein or RBD of

279

SARS-CoV-2, except SARS-CoV antibody CR3022 which binds to the SARS-CoV-2

280

RBD with a KD of 6.2 nM 21, 22. In this study, we demonstrated that the binding affinity

281

of CR3022 is lower than 4 antibodies from Bin2. Furthermore, the neutralization

282

activity of CR3022 against RBD of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 is vanished when compared

283

with our antibodies, implying that the binding motif of SARS-CoV maybe different from

284

SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the pseudovirus entry and authentic virus infection of

285

Vero-E6 are both inhibited significantly by these antibodies.

286

In summary, the patient-derived antibody libraries provide another approach for

287

developing therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19 pandemic and the neutralizing

288

monoclonal antibodies will not only have the potential in clinical application but also

289

benefit the mechanism in exploring of SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells.

Anti-RBD antibody measurement

294

18 plasma samples from COVID-19 patients and 3 plasma samples from healthy

295

donors were enrolled in this study. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody ELISA was performed

296

according to the standard ELISA method. Briefly, 30 μl plasma were added to wells

297

coated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD and incubated for 1 hour at 4℃. Wells

298

were washed three times with PBST (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) followed by the addition

scFv phage display library construction and quality assessment

305

Total RNA was prepared from the B lymphocytes of convalescent COVID-19 patients,

306

followed by cDNA synthesis. The genes for variable regions of heavy chain and light

307

chain (VH and VL) were amplified separately and then cloned into the phage-display

308

vector. The recombinant vector was transformed into Escherichia coli (E. coli) TG1 by

309

electroporation. Cells were plated on bioassay dishes containing 2-YT agar (1.6%

310

tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 1.5% bacteriological agar) with 100 μg/ml

311

ampicillin and 2% glucose. Following overnight incubation, colonies were scraped off

312

the bioassay dishes and finally stored at −80°C as a primary scFv library. Colony

313

counts of a diluted subpopulation were undertaken to estimate library size. Quality

314

assessment of the library was undertaken by RT-PCR. Amplification of a random

315

selection of 100 clones using the oligonucleotides was undertaken to indicate if clones

316

possessed inserts of the correct size on 1.5% DNA agarose gels. ScFv molecules

317

displayed by rescued phages (M13KO7) were detected via the Myc tag in the

325

immediately neutralized with 1.0M Tris–Cl, pH 8.8. Eluted phage scFv were subjected

326

to the next round of infection, rescue, and selection. After three rounds of panning, the

Neutralization activity of mAbs against pseudovirus

389

RFP/SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus system was used as an infection model to

390

evaluate the neutralization activity of antibodies. First, the RFP/SARS-CoV-2 spike

391

pseudoviruses were pre-incubated with a serial dilution of purified whole IgG

392

antibodies. Then, 293T-ACE2 cells were infected by the RFP/SARS-CoV-2 spike

393

pseudovirus with or without antibodies. After 2 hours incubation at 37℃, the medium

394

was refreshed with DMEM containing 10% FBS and continuously cultured for another

working stocks of the virus. To analyze the mAb neutralizing activities, two-fold serial

401

dilutions of mAbs were added to the same volume of 100 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 and

402

incubated for 1 hour at 37℃. The mixture was added to a monolayer of Vero-E6 cells

403

in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37℃. Cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed and

404

recorded from day 4 to day 6. For immunofluorescence (IF) analysis, Vero-E6 cells

405

were transfected and fixed on day 6 post-transfection in 80% acetone for 10 min at

pseudotyped with S glycoproteins from the SARS-COV-2 virus. (C) HIVs pseudotyped

518

with the S glycoprotein were incubated with Abs diluted as indicated in the figure for 1

519

h before infection. Fluorescence intensity in target cells were measured, and the

520

percent neutralization was calculated. Bars indicate SE. (D) The authentic infection of

521

SARS-CoV-2 to Vero-E6 cells was neutralized by Anti-RBD antibodies. (E) The IC50 of
