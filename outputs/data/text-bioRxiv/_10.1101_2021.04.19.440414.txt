Abstract

27

There is a lack of experimental evidence to explain how the B.1.1.7 variant spreads

28

more quickly than pre-existing variants in humans. We found that B.1.1.7 displays

29

increased competitive fitness over earlier D614G lineages in an in-vitro

30

system. Furthermore, , we demonstrated that B.1.1.7 variant is able to replicate and

31

shed more efficiently in the nasal cavity than other variants with lower dose and shorter

32

duration of exposure.

35

In late 2020, a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC), VOC 202012/01 (lineage

36

B.1.1.7) was identified in the United Kingdom. This B.1.1.7 variant containing multiple

37

mutations in spike1 has become dominant in the UK and is now rapidly spreading

38

across multiple countries2. It is thought that this VOC has the potential to spread more

39

quickly and with higher mortality than the pandemic to date3. Recently, using multiple

40

behavioural and epidemiological data sources, Davies et al. estimated that the VOC

41

202012/01 variant (lineage B.1.1.7) has a 43–90% higher reproduction number than

42

pre-existing variants in England4. In another study, Davies et al. indicated that among

43

specimens collected in the UK in early 2021, higher concentrations of virus were found

44

on nasopharyngeal swabs from B.1.1.7 infected individuals, as measured by Ct values

45

from PCR testing5. However, there is a lack of experimental evidence to support the

46

expectation that B.1.1.7 does indeed spread more quickly than pre-existing variants.

47
48
49

The B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 harbours 21 non-synonymous point mutations and

50

3 deletions in comparison to the reference genome (accession number:

51

NC_0.45512.2). Of these, 8 mutations and 2 deletions are involved in changes in the

52

spike protein, which interacts with the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting

53

enzyme 2 (ACE2), and mediates virus entry into host cells6. These spike mutations

54

include the deletion ∆H69/∆V70, which has arisen in multiple independent lineages

55

and is suggested to associate with increased infectivity and evasion of the immune

56

response7; the mutation N501Y, which enhances binding affinity for the human ACE2

57

receptor and therefore influences viral transmissibility8, 9; and the mutation P681H,

58

which is adjacent to the S1/S2 furin cleavage site in spike and might have an impact

59

on viral infectivity10, 11.

60
61
62

A recent study indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 VOC carrying the 501Y mutation

63

showed no higher infectivity in cell than ancestral D614G variants12. Likewise, we did

64

not observe replication of the B.1.1.7 variant to be significantly enhanced over that of

65

other tested variants at any of the selected time-points in Vero-E6 and Calu-3 cells

66

(Extended Data Fig. 1), however, we did observe that B.1.1.7 dominates in competitive

67

fitness assays. These comparisons of replication fitness between B.1.1.7 and earlier

68

circulating strains were performed in Calu-3 cells through simultaneous co-infection at

69

a 1:1 ratio with B.1.1.7 (accession number: MW856794) and another variant of the

70

D614G lineage, either B.1-G (HK-95, accession number: MT835143) or B.1.GH (405,

71

accession number: MW856793) (Fig. 1). After three rounds of consecutive passage at

72

72-hour intervals, the B.1.1.7 variant became dominant in both co-culture conditions,

73

suggesting that the additional substitutions in B.1.1.7 enhance SARS-CoV-2

74

replication fitness in cells.

75
76

Next, we set up a Syrian hamster infection study to evaluate if B.1.1.7 exhibits higher

77

infectivity in vivo. 6-8-week-old male Syrian hamsters were intranasally infected with

78

50 microliters of different variants (2x104 PFU/ml), which is equivalent to 1000 PFU

79

per inoculum, as indicated in Fig. 2A. Infectious viral titres in upper (nasal) and lower

80

(pulmonary) tissues were measured on four consecutive days after infection. All

81

viruses tested replicated to similar titres in nasal turbinate and lung tissues of infected

82

hamsters. This result is consistent with two recent studies which also found no

83

significant alteration in infectious viral titres in samples collected from nasal washes,

84

throat swabs and lungs from hamsters infected with different SARS-CoV-2 variants13,

85

14

86

infection with high-titre inocula may hamper discrimination of differences in the

87

infectivity and replication efficiency of variants15. In fact, by titrating the infection

88

dosage (10-fold dilution) of the inocula administered to hamsters, we observed that

89

viral replication in nasal tissues of infected hamsters had already plateaued with

90

infection doses of 100 PFU and upwards, even on day one post-infection (Extended

91

data Fig. 2). Humans are exposed to varying doses of infectious particles during

92

SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We reasoned that SARS-CoV-2 variants which can initiate

93

effective infection with fewer infectious particles are likely to transmit more effectively

94

than other variants requiring more infectious particles. To test this, we performed

95

another hamster infection study using only 10 PFU per inoculum, with samples being

96

collected at 16 hours post-infection. Interestingly, infectious viral loads in nasal

97

turbinates of hamsters were found to be significantly higher with B.1.1.7 compared to

98

the other viruses, whereas similar viral loads were observed in lungs of all infected

99

hamsters, except for those inoculated with B.1-G (HK-95), which exhibits higher viral

100
101

. Given that hamsters are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, intranasal

titres in lungs, although with large variations between replicates (Fig. 2B).

102

SARS-CoV-2 VOCs have been emerging in different countries in the past few months,

103

and it is crucial to establish relevant experimental models to characterise existing and

104

new variants in terms of transmissibility, disease severity and vaccine efficacy, and to

105

evaluate therapeutic interventions. In this report, by using a lower infectious dose, we

106

demonstrate that B.1.1.7 exhibits higher infectivity and/or replication efficiency in the

107

nasal epithelium. Our data, albeit limited, strengthen the contention that this novel

108

VOC is more easily transmitted than other pre-existing strains. Further work, including

109

transmission studies with optimised inoculum dosages and timing of sample collection

110

and investigation into routes of transmission are required. A better understanding of

111

SARS-CoV-2 dynamics is important for designing combative strategies for the

112

prevention and control of virus infections.

228

Viruses

229

The SARS-CoV-2 isolates HK-95 (MT835143), 405 (MW856793), B.1.1.7 (MW856794)

230

and HK-15 (MT835141) were isolated from specimens obtained from four laboratory-

231

confirmed COVID-19 patients using Vero E6 cells (ATCC; CRL-15786). All

232

experiments involving SARS-CoV-2 viruses were conducted in a Biosafety Level-3

233

laboratory. For animal challenge, viral stocks were prepared after two serial passages

234

of isolated virus in Vero E6 cells in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)

235

(Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher

236

Scientific), and 100 IU penicillin G/ml and 100 ml streptomycin sulfate/ml (Thermo

237

Fisher Scientific). Virus titres were then determined by plaque assay using Vero E6

238

cells. Viral RNAs were obtained from the supernatants of infected cells and then

239

isolated using the QIAamp RNA Viral kit (Qiagen) and subjected to whole viral genome

240

sequencing.

Hamster Infection

244

Female golden Syrian hamsters, aged 6-8 weeks old, were obtained from the LASEC,

245

Chinese University of Hong Kong via the Centre for Comparative Medicine Research

246

at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). All experiments were performed in a Biosafety

247

Level-3 animal facility at the LKS Faculty of Medicine, HKU. All animal studies were

248

approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research,

249

HKU. Hamsters were anesthetized with ketamine (150mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/mg)

250

via intraperitoneal injection prior to nasal inoculation. All hamsters were euthanized

251

by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital at 200 mg/kg.
