Abstract
A number of single-cell RNA studies looking at the human immune response to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been recently published. However, the number of
samples used in each individual study typically is small, moreover the technologies and
protocols used in different studies vary, thus somewhat restricting the range of conclusions
that can be made with high confidence. To better capture the cellular gene expression
changes upon SARS-CoV-2 infection at different levels and stages of disease severity and
to minimise the effect of technical artefacts, we performed meta-analysis of data from 9
previously published studies, together comprising 143 human samples, and a set of 16
healthy control samples (10X). In particular, we used generally accepted immune cell
markers to discern specific cell subtypes and to look at the changes of the cell proportion
over different disease stages and their consistency across the studies. While half of the
observations reported in the individual studies can be confirmed across multiple studies, half
of the results seem to be less conclusive. In particular, we show that the differentially
expressed genes consistently point to upregulation of type I Interferon signal pathway and
downregulation of the mitochondrial genes, alongside several other reproducibly consistent
changes. We also confirm the presence of expanded B-cell clones in COVID-19 patients,
however, no consistent trend in T-cell clonal expansion was observed.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the global pandemic caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a recognised major threat to the

humanity. Thanks to studies from countries around the world, a significant progress in the
fields of disease diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of this disease has been made.
However, the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the immunological characteristics
associated with the severity of the disease are still unknown.
To understand the pathology and immune response in COVID-19 patients, a number of
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments have been performed on different cell
types obtained from human patients​1–7​. Studies on diseases caused by influenza and other
respiratory viruses have shown that the peripheral immune response plays an important role
in the defence against the infections and disease progression​1​. In COVID-19 patients,
several pathways have been reported to be regulated, including the CCR1 and CCR5
pathways​5​, the HLA class II and type I interferon pathways​2​, the IL1B pathways and
interferon-stimulated genes​4​. However, most studies only focus on pathway analysis in
certain cell types. Due to the limited patient sample availability, it is difficult to derive
statistically reliable trends in the changes of cell subtype proportions over the disease stages
in individual studies. It is still unclear to what extent some of the observations can be
generalized and which pathways are consistently regulated.
Here we report results from systematic meta-analysis of 9 single-cell RNA-seq datasets from
SARS-CoV-2 infected patient samples and a healthy control dataset. In these datasets, 3 of
them have T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data and 2 have B cell receptor (BCR)
sequencing data available. Specifically, we analysed 1) the cell type and cell proportion
captured in different experiments to infer the immune response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection;
2) the gene expression regulation and pathway activation in COVID-19 patients; 3) the clonal
expansion in T cells and B cells. While we can reproduce 84.21% of the 19 previous
conclusions based on small sample size in their original datasets, we could not fully
reproduce less than half of these conclusions in other studies. In particular, we show
consistent upregulation of type I Interferon signal pathway and downregulation of the
mitochondrial genes, as well as demonstrate an absence of consistent T-cell clonal
expansion in COVID-19 patients across studies.

Results
Meta-analysis reveals common cell types and tissue-specific
heterogeneity
● Mapping of the disease states
The overview of the datasets is given in ​Table 1​, which also gives each dataset a name
referred to throughout the text. In total, the datasets that we analysed include 159
experimental samples and 862,354 cells across 9 different disease conditions. Considering
the sample stages in different datasets are defined with different names, we map them to
standardised terms Healthy, Mild, Moderate, Severe, Post Mild, Convalescent, Late
recovery, Asymptomatic and Influenza (​Supplementary Table S1​). Although such
retrospective standardisation may introduce a certain level of noise, the mapping of
comparable conditions is essential for meta-analysis (​Figure 1)​ . We have taken care to
consider the detailed descriptions of the named conditions as presented in the respective

papers and we are confident that for the purposes of our analysis the introduced mappings
are correct (see​ ​Supplementary Data 1​).
Visualisation of the combined data using uniform manifold approximation and projection
(UMAP) in ​Figure 2a shows strong batch-effect corresponding to different studies. We find
the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) datasets are more similar to each other and
form three large cell clusters, which are the lymphoid lineage, myeloid lineage and the B
cells. The Wilk PBMC dataset, which is based on the Seq-Well technique, clusters
separately. After the data integration and batch-effect removal with Harmony​8​, the cells from
different studies were no longer separated and largely clustered by the underlying biology
(​Figure 2b​). Moreover, the healthy samples are also well-mixed, except the epithelial cells,
which are mainly captured in the Chua dataset.
Similar to previous publication​4,9​, the cells can be classified into 5 major cell populations,
Figure 3​: Lymphoid cells (​CD3D, CD3E, NKG7, GNLY​), Myeloid cells(​CD68, CD14, CD1C,
LILRA4)​ , B cells (​CD79A, MS4A1, MZB1)​ , Epithelial cells (​KRT8, KRT19​) and Platelets
(​PF4, PPBP)​ . Marker gene expressions are shown in ​Supplementary Figure S1​, while
previously reported marker gene lists are summarized in ​Supplementary Data 2​.
Cells in each population are then further divided into subpopulations based on the
expression of marker genes and logistic regression reference-based annotation methods
(see ​Methods)​. The resulting cell clusters were further refined using SCCAF​10​; all the 5 cell
populations achieved self-projection accuracies above 92% in the Harmony latent space,
Supplementary Table S2​. The final result includes 37 cell subpopulations excluding
doublets.
In the lymphoid cell population, we define 5 CD8​+ T cell subpopulations, including CD8n T
cell, CD8m T(GZMK), CD8m T(GZMH), CD8m T(IL7R) and CD8 effector cells. The CD8n T
cells cluster next to the CD4 naive T cells and express ​CD8B, CD8A, CD3D, CD3E and
CCR7​. CD8m T(GZMK), CD8m T(GZMH) and CD8m T(IL7R) are 3 subpopulations of the
CD8 T cells and show complementary marker genes (​GZMK, GZMH and ​IL7R​),
Supplementary Figure S2​. ​GZMH is known as a cytotoxic effector T cell marker, while
GZMK is a transitional effector T cell marker​11​. ​GZMH and ​GZMK not only show good
discrimination of the CD8​+ T cell subpopulations, but also discriminates the NK cell
populations, ​Supplementary Figure S3​. The CD8eff T cell is a proliferating cell
subpopulation and is easily distinguishable.
CD56 (​NCAM1)​ , ​GNLY and ​NKG7 highlight the NK cells. We further divide the NK cells into
4 subpopulations NK (GZMH​+​), NK(GZMK), NK(SYNE2) and mito-high NK. The mito-high
NK cluster has a higher level of percentage of mitochondrial RNA contents and also
expresses T cell markers (​CD3D, CD3E​) as well as some red blood cell markers (​HBB,
HBA1, HBA2)​ . Therefore, the mito-high NK cluster is possibly a contaminated subpopulation.
Considering γδ T cells comprise 1%–10% of human PBMCs, it is difficult to distinguish the
γδ T cell subpopulations within a single dataset. The existing annotations of γδ T cells are
not fully consistent: Wilk et al. annotated according to the γδ TCR constant chains encoding
genes (​TRGC1, TRGC2 and ​TRDC​), while Zhang et al. annotated γδ T cells as
TRGV9​+​TRDV2​+​. However, these groups of marker genes highlight two cell subpopulations

next to each other, ​Supplementary Figure S4​. It is known that Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are the major
subset of γδ T cells in human PBMCs​12​. According to the marker knowledge of γδ T
cells​12–14​, we define the TRGV9​+​TRDV2​+ subpopulation as Vγ9Vδ2 T cells and other
CD161(KLRB1)​+​TRGC1​+​TRGC2​+ cells as γδ T cells. The γδ T cells also express canonical
​ as well as ​SLC4A10​16 and ​TRAV1-217
​ ​, which are known as
γδ T cell markers ​CCR5, CCR615
Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cell markers.
Although the monocytes cells have been discussed in a previous publication​18​, we are able
to refine this type to include 3 CD16​+ monocytes subpopulations and 2 CD14​+ monocytes
subpopulations. CD16​+ monocytes express high ​FCGR3A (​CD16​), while CD16
monocytes(C1QA) not only express the complement proteins (​C1QA, C1QB, C1QC​) but
also ​HLA-DRA and ​CD63​. The CD16 monocytes(CTSL) cluster expresses ​CTSL and
CD163​, the CD16 monocytes(S100A9) cluster expresses ​S100A8 and ​S100A9​,
Supplementary Figure S5​. These cell clusters correlate well with the cell populations
reported by Schulte-Schrepping et al.​18​. Neutrophils were not annotated in all the reported
datasets​3​4.​ However, after annotating neutrophils according to the canonical markers
(​FCGR3B and ​CXCR2​), ​Supplementary Figure S6​, we find that they exist in all the datasets
(but hardly in the healthy controls).
We broadly divided the B cells into naïve B, memory B and plasma cells, where the naive
B-cells were further divided into Naïve B(EEF1G), Naïve B(TMSB4X) and Naïve B(IGHD)
based on the marker genes’ expression and memory B-cells were further divided into
Memory B(EEF1G) and Memory B(CD27).

Meta-analysis shows consistently decreasing relative
proportion of lymphoid cells and increasing proportion of
myeloid cells with disease severity
In ​Figure 4a​, we show the average cell composition change of the 37 cell subpopulations at
different disease stages. The lymphoid cells (T cells and NK cells) decrease from healthy to
severe (healthy, mild, moderate, severe), while myeloid cells (CD14 and CD16 monocytes,
Neutrophils) relatively increase. In the recovery stages (post mild, convalescent and late
recovery), the lymphoid cell proportions are comparable to the proportion at the mild stage
but higher than the proportions in moderate and severe stages. And for myeloid cells, the
cell proportions are higher than those in the healthy and mild stages. The cell composition of
asymptomatic patients is similar to healthy donors. Possibly the asymptomatic patients do
not show notable immune responses. Influenza infection data was only found in the Lee
dataset and the result shows a very different cell composition from those in COVID-19
infection, where influenza patients have a similar level of lymphoid cells as the moderate
COVID-19 patients but more CD14​+​ monocytes.
To understand the disease process in each dataset separately, 4 datasets (Zhang, Wilk,
Chua and Liao) include stages of healthy, moderate and severe, while the Lee dataset
includes healthy, mild and severe (here, we keep the mild and moderate as different stages
because the samples from patients with mild response show difference in the cell
composition from those with moderate infections). Since the 10X reference dataset was
used as a healthy reference in the He study​6​, we use the same strategy when analysing this

dataset. According to the distribution of these 6 datasets, we find a consistent decreasing
trend over the stages from healthy to severe, except for the Liao dataset (​Figure 4b​).
Healthy samples of the same tissue type are expected to show similar results. The 4
datasets (Lee, Zhang, Wilk and Chua) show a similar proportion of T cells in healthy donors,
which is around 30-40%. But the 10X healthy PBMC reference shows ~60% T cells and the
Liao dataset of BALF shows only ~10% T cells. Due to the lack of BALF-derived healthy
samples in the He dataset, we cannot confirm whether this is expected in healthy BALF
samples or if it corresponds to the general individual-specific variability such as that explored
by Wong et al. 2013​19​. However, we can still find a decrease of T cell proportion from
moderate to severe stages in the Liao dataset.
The percentages of monocytes and neutrophils relatively increase from healthy to severe
stages. Similar to the T cell proportion distribution, the Lee, Zhang, Wilk, Chua and 10X
datasets show ~20% monocytes in the healthy samples, ​Figure 4d.​ In the Liao data this
percentage is around 80% and it still shows an increase in monocytes from moderate stage
to severe stage. If we use 20% as a reference value for monocytes in healthy controls, in the
Liao dataset monocytes further increase from healthy to severe patients. For neutrophils, the
6 datasets consistently illustrate an increasing trend from healthy to severe, though the
levels of increase can vary, ​Figure 4e​. In the He and Chua dataset, some of the samples
may even include 40%-70% neutrophils.
Only a small number of Plasma cells have been detected in the data from healthy donors,
but the cell proportion increases in the moderate and severe stages, which is consistent for
all the 6 datasets, ​Figure 4f​. In contrast, we do not find a consistent cell composition change
trend for B cells, ​Supplementary Figure S7a​. The B cells increase in the Lee dataset but
decrease in the severe samples of the He dataset, while Zhang, Wilk, Chua and Liao
datasets do not show a clear trend. Similarly, when looking at B-cells in more granularity,
there seems to be a decrease in naïve B-cells in severe patients and a decrease in memory
B-cells in moderate and asymptomatic patients compared to healthy controls (​Figure 4g​).
However, no consistent trend is observed for naïve B-cells and memory B-cells across
multiple datasets (​Supplementary Figure S7b,c​). An increase in naïve B-cell proportion is
observed from healthy controls to convalescent (and late recovery patients) in Zhang and
Wen datasets (​Supplementary Figure S7d​) but this is contrary to that reported by Wen et
al. 2020​4​.
Although dendritic cells take up only a small portion of the population (~2% in healthy
PBMCs), they decrease over the disease stages in Lee, Zhang, Chua and Liao datasets
(​Supplementary Figure S7e​). Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are even fewer than dendritic
cells, the Zhang and Wilk datasets show clear increasing trends over the disease stages
(​Supplementary Figure S7f​). But the same conclusion cannot be derived from other
datasets (​Supplementary Figure S7f​).

Robust response to type I interferon and HLA class II
downregulation in multiple cell types
To study the response of gene regulatory pathways to COVID infection, we identified
differentially expressed (DE) genes and pathways by comparing the mild, moderate and

severe patient samples with healthy controls. For each dataset, we first measure the DE
genes between moderate samples and healthy controls, and also the DE genes between
severe samples and healthy controls, ​Figure 5a​. Then, we compare the log fold changes of
the genes (False Detection Rate <0.01) between moderate/healthy and severe/healthy.
Interestingly, the log fold changes between severe and healthy correlates with the log fold
changes between moderate and healthy, which indicates that the genes upregulated and
downregulated in moderate and severe samples compared to the healthy controls are
similar, ​Figure 5b, c​. Moreover, we find the correlation happens in most of the cell types in
all studies (including Zhang, Wilk, Liao and Chua). The Lee dataset does not include
moderate samples, but includes mild samples, which are different from the moderate ones in
cell type composition. It is not surprising that the correlation between mild/healthy and
severe/healthy is lower than moderate/healthy and severe/healthy. Nevertheless, this
correlation is still positive in all the cell types.
Furthermore, we identified the genes upregulated in both moderate and severe samples for
each study and checked the overlaps between different studies. In CD14 monocytes, 3822,
639 and 650 genes are upregulated in the Zhang, Wilk and Liao datasets respectively. Of
these, 153 genes are consistently upregulated by all the studies, ​Figure 5d​. Pathway
analysis of these 153 genes highlight the gene ontology terms: immune response, response
to virus and type I interferon signalling pathway. Although the upregulation of type I
interferon signalling pathway in monocytes has been reported by Wilk et al. 2020​2​, the
upregulation mainly happens in CD14 monocytes and not in CD16 monocytes. We find the
upregulation of type I interferon signalling pathway in many of the cell types, including T cells
(CD4 T, CD8 T and γδ T), NK cells, DC, pDC, B cells, Plasma cells and Neutrophils
(​Supplementary Figure S8​). Thus, the upregulation of type I interferon signalling pathway
seems to be consistent for many cell types. Specifically, we find the upregulation of ​IFITM3,
IFIT3, IFI44, IFI44L, IFI16, IFI6, LY6E, ISG15, ISG20, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3​ and ​OASL.​
Similarly, genes related to SRP-dependent co-translational protein targeting to membrane as
well as the mitochondrial proteins are consistently downregulated in immune cell types. In
NK cells and γδ T cells, 16 and 17 genes are downregulated in all the three datasets (Zhang,
Wilk, Liao) respectively. These genes include mitochondrial genes (​MT-ATP6, MT-CO1,
MT-CO2, MT-CO3, MT-CYB, MT-ND4, MT-ND5, MT-ND3, MT-ND1, MT-ND2​), ​KLRB1 and
UBA52​.
Additionally, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II genes have been reported to be
downregulated in monocytes of severe COVID-19 patients​2​. We found that in CD14
monocytes, HLA class II module scores (see ​Methods​) were significantly lower (Bonferroni
corrected p-value < 0.05) in severe COVID-19 patients than healthy controls across all the
three PBMC datasets (Lee, Zhang and Wilk), as well as in the Liao dataset and the Chua
dataset (​Figure 5f​). This observation was also consistent in CD16 monocytes, dendritic cells
(DCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) across all the five datasets but not in NK
cells, naive B-cells or memory B-cells (​Supplementary Figure S9​).
The interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) have been reported to be heterogeneously
upregulated in CD14 monocytes in COVID-19 (both moderate and severe)​2​. We found the
result is reproducible in Wilk, Zhang and Liao datasets. However, the result in the Lee
dataset demonstrates a downregulation and the difference in Chua dataset was not

statistically significant (​Figure 5g​). Therefore, we may not confirm a definite result for the
ISG regulation in COVID-19 patients.

Meta-analysis did not provide validation of the developing
neutrophil population in severe COVID-19 patients
Although we were able to reproduce the developing neutrophil population described by Wilk
et al. 2020​2 in their own dataset (​Supplementary Figure S10d​), we could not validate it in
the severe COVID-19 patients from other datasets (​Supplementary Figure S11)​ . In fact, we
noticed that in Wilk et al. 2020 too these developing neutrophil markers were present in the
cell subpopulation annotated as “Epithelial (RACK1)” (​Supplementary Figure S10a,d​).
When subsetting this cell subpopulation only to the severe patients of Wilk dataset, we
noticed that it had marker genes for red blood cells, monocytes, developing neutrophils,
B-cells and 2 other clusters, thereby representing a broad set of cells (​Supplementary
Figure S10b-c​). To make sure that we didn’t miss the developing neutrophil population in
the severe COVID-19 patients from other datasets during the sub-setting process, we first
checked all the developing neutrophil marker genes’ expression for all the cell-types and
then only for plasma cells and epithelial (RACK1) cells. We did not observe the developing
neutrophil population in either case (​Supplementary Figure S11)​ . This may partly be
explained by the low number of plasma and epithelial (RACK1) cells captured by other
datasets compared to Wilk dataset (n=2862 cells). Also, Seq-Well platform for scRNA-seq
used in Wilk dataset compared to 10X used in other studies might have an effect on top of
the underlying patient-specific variability contributed by factors such as age, sex, ethnicity,
genetics, received immunomodulatory drugs and lifestyle. Further, the datasets Liao et al.
2020​9 and Chua et al. 2020​5 were derived from BALF and nasopharyngeal/bronchial tissues,
respectively, compared to others derived from PBMC.

Meta-analysis is inconclusive in regards to a consistent trend in
T-cell clonal expansion across COVID-19 stages
For the current section, we analyzed the T-cell receptor (TCR) data from Wen et al. 2020​4​,
Zhang et al. 2020​3 and Liao et al. 2020​9 where the samples from the first two studies were
derived from PBMC while those from the third one were derived from BALF. Among these,
the conditions healthy and convalescent were present in both the PBMC datasets, while the
moderate and severe stages were present in Zhang et al. 2020​3 and Liao et al. 2020​9 TCR
datasets only.
We first pooled T-cell and NK cell data from all the studies together and visualized them
using UMAP (​Figure 3​: “Lymphoid cells” and ​Figure 6a​). As expected, NK-cells mostly had
no corresponding TCR data. For the cells with TCR data, we observed clonal expansion of
CD8m T-cells, particularly the subpopulations CD8m T(GZMH) and CD8m T(GZMK) and
Vγ9V 2 T-cells (​Figure 6a​). Their clonal expansion did not appear to be stage-specific
(​Figure 6a​). However, we observed an over-representation of CD8​+ effector T-cells in
severe patients. These observations were confirmed in the bar plots where samples from all
the datasets at a specific stage were pooled in together and normalized according to the

total number of cells at each stage (​Figure 6b​). This is also consistent with Zhang et al.
2020​20​.
To further check if these observations were consistent across studies, we analyzed the
overall clonal expansion trend of T-cells. Contrary to previously published results​3,4​, we didn’t
observe a consistent trend of increased clonal expansion of T-cells in COVID-19 patients
compared to healthy controls (​Figure 6c​). Although the moderate and severe patients of
Zhang et al. 2020​3 and Liao et al. 2020​9 seemed to share a similar percentage range of
clonally expanded T-cells, Liao et al. 2020​9 lacked the TCR data corresponding to healthy
controls from BALF tissue, making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions. Also, the healthy
controls from Zhang et al. 2020​3 seemed to be different from the healthy controls from Wen
et al. 2020​4 in terms of percentage of clonally expanded T-cells, thereby making it difficult to
find a decrease in convalescent patients compared to healthy controls as reported by Wen et
al. 2020​4​.
Zhang et al. 2020​20 showed that the overall increased TCR clonal expansion was observed
in the severe convalescent COVID-19 patients, compared to healthy control, in the top 6
clonotypes ratio analysis. However, in all datasets, the differences between individuals were
found to be large, and in some datasets greater than the differences between groups
​ . This seems to indicate that there are multiple factors that may affect TCR
(​Figure 6c​)20​
clonal expansion.
We repeated the analysis on CD8​+ T-cell subpopulations showing clonal expansion in
Figure 6a (and ​Figure 6b​) to check if they share a common trend across stages. As shown
in ​Figure 6d​, the results were inconclusive for memory CD8​+ T-cells but increased clonal
expansion of γ T-cells, with more than 5 clones in each clonotype (group ‘Expnd (n>5)’)
was observed in recovered patients compared to healthy across both the PBMC datasets.
Further, due to the presence of less than 100 CD8​+ effector T-cells in most of the samples,
we were unable to analyze this subpopulation in greater detail (​Supplementary Figure
S12a-b​). We also observed that all the samples from the Liao et al. 2020​9 TCR dataset had
less than 100 cells each for most of the T-cell subpopulations (​Supplementary Figure
S12a​), thereby leaving us with only one dataset, Zhang et al. 2020​3​, with samples from
severe and moderate stages. Regarding the remaining T-cell subpopulations, naive CD8​+
T-cell showed increased clonal expansion in severe patients in Zhang et al. 2020​3 compared
to healthy control (clonally expanded clonotypes with 2 to 5 clones each; group ‘Expnd
(2<=n<=5)’) and similar clonal expansion status in convalescent patients compared to
healthy controls in Zhang et al. 2020​3 (​Supplementary Figure S12c)​ . Whereas for naive
CD4​+ T-cells, the convalescent stage appeared to be similar to healthy across both the
PBMC datasets (​Supplementary Figure S12d​). Similar to memory CD8​+ T-cells, we didn’t
find any consistent trend in memory CD4​+​ T-cells (​Supplementary Figure S12e​).

Meta-analysis of B-cell receptor data confirms the presence of
clonally expanded B-cells in COVID-19 patients across multiple
datasets
The B-cell receptor (BCR) data was collected from two PBMC studies: Wen et al. 2020​4 and
Zhang et al. 2020​3 out of which the stages healthy and convalescent were present in both

the datasets. The initial visualization of B-cell subpopulations with or without BCR data using
UMAP showed that the BCR data was available for almost all the B-cell subpopulations
(​Figure 3​: “B-cells” and ​Figure 7a​). It also showed the presence of expanded Plasma cells
in mostly COVID-19 patients (​Figure 7a​). This observation was confirmed when cells from
all the studies at each stage were taken together and normalized by the total number of cells
present at each stage (​Supplementary Figure S13a​). Increased clonal expansion of Naïve
B(EEF1G) and Memory B(EEF1G) cell subpopulations was also observed in severe
COVID-19 patients compared to other B-cell subpopulations in severe patients
(​Supplementary Figure S13a​).
We further analyzed whether the previously reported observations​3,4 of increased B-cell
clonal expansion in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls can be confirmed and
found that this is indeed consistent (​Figure 7b​). For closer examination of clonal expansion
of specific B-cell subpopulations in COVID-19 patients (​Figure 3​: “B-cells”​), we grouped
them into three major groups to have a comparable number of cells in each sample: namely
memory B-cells, naïve B-cells and plasma cells. It was observed that there were less than
100 plasma cells with corresponding BCR data in most of the samples to draw any reliable
conclusions (​Supplementary Figure S13b​). In case of naïve B-cells, we observed slightly
higher clonal expansion in convalescent COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls in
both the studies (clonally expanded clonotypes with 2 to 5 clones each; group ‘Expnd
(2<=n<=5)’; ​Supplementary Figure S13c​), but this difference was not statistically
significant. We also observed increased clonal expansion of naïve B-cells in moderate and
severe COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls in both the clonally expanded
groups (‘Expnd (2<=n<=5)’ and ‘Expnd (n>5); Supplementary Figure S​13c​) but as the Wen
dataset lacks samples from these stages, this observation is not applicable to the Wen
dataset. In case of memory B-cells we didn’t observe any consistent trend in clonal
expansion status across stages (​Supplementary Figure S13d​)

Discussion
Understanding the immunological landscape of SARS-COV2 is an important part of
molecular biology research relevant to fighting the pandemic. Previous single cell studies
have tried to contribute to the knowledge of COVID-19 infection across multiple disease
stages, however, these studies suffer from limited sample size and lack standardization in
data collection, pre-processing, cell-type annotation and analysis. In this study, we have tried
to identify which of the previously published conclusions are reproducible across multiple
datasets and which are study specific when these datasets are analyzed in a standardised
way (summarized in ​Tables 1 and 2​).
By remapping the reads, we were able to identify certain cell populations that were missed
out by the original studies. For example, we observed neutrophil population in the Zhang and
the Wen datasets, not reported by the original studies. Further, all nine COVID-19
scRNA-seq datasets analyzed in this study had samples collected from patients at different
stages, thereby making it difficult to perform homogeneous comparison across all studies.
An ideal way would have been to regroup the samples according to the stages defined on a
standardized scale (e.g. the WHO scale​21​) but due to the lack of this metric in the present
datasets, we had to make various assumptions, which we verified by considering the

available detail in the information provided in original publications and in some cases by
contacting the authors. In particular, we assumed that the healthy, severe, early recovery
(convalescent) and asymptomatic stages should be comparable. We also checked whether
samples at moderate stage from other datasets could be merged with samples at mild stage
from Lee et al. 2020​1 dataset, but these two stages exhibited different cell-proportion
distributions (Figure 4) and differentially expressed genes and were, therefore, kept as
separate. Presence of more BCR data, longitudinal samples with a detailed history of
received therapeutic interventions, particularly those with immunomodulatory effects such as
Azithromycin​22 given to severe patients in the Wilk dataset​2​, additional clinical data on
pre-existing conditions and ethnicities​19​, comparison with asymptomatic patients and
presence of other omics modalities​23–27 would have helped to strengthen the current
analysis.
Bar the mentioned uncertainties, which may explain some of the unconfirmed original results
across individual studies, this study provides a direct comparison of multiple single cell
COVID-19 studies published to date. As shown in ​Table 2​, we can reproduce 16 out of 19
(84.21%) previously published results we considered in the original datasets and can only
reproduce 8 out of 19 (42.11%) previously published results in other datasets.

12
expression matrix includes 26,924 features, 18,410 of which are overlapped with the
features in the reference genome used in the Wen dataset. The ‘celltype’ column in the
dataset was used as cell type annotation.

Data processing
Quality control
All the datasets include 33,538 features except the He and Chua datasets. For the He and
Chua datasets, only the gene symbols that overlap with the other datasets are considered.
All the datasets are combined together for quality control and downstream analyses. We
filtered the cells with higher than 15% of mitochondrial contents. We also excluded cells of
fewer than 500 UMIs or fewer than 200 features. Features expressed in fewer than 3 cells
were removed in the analysis. We used Scrublet (version 0.2.1)​33 to determine the doublets
in the datasets. As Scrublet was designed to deal with 10X data, the result on Wilk dataset
was not used. Cell clusters represented by doublets were removed from the analysis
(​Supplementary Figure S14​). The cell numbers after quality control were listed in ​Table 1​.

Data Integration
SCANPY​34 workflow was used to analyze the data. The following steps were performed:
data normalization, log-transformation, highly variable genes selection using the ‘cellranger’
flavor and principal component analysis. Then, we used Harmony (version 0.0.5)​8 to
integrate data from different samples. UMAP​35 and Louvain​36 clustering were calculated
according to the Harmony corrected latent space.

Cell type annotation
For the eight datasets of the same reference genome (Wen, Liao, Lee, Yu and Jiang
datasets) we combined the dataset to annotate all the cell types. We first used logistic
regression in SCCAF​10 to infer the cell types using the possible cell types. And each of the
Louvain clusters was assigned to a cell type label accordingly. For Wilk dataset and Chua
dataset, we used the cell type annotations adopted from the publication. For the He dataset,
we annotated the cell types according to the marker gene expression.
To determine the cell types in the data, we first used a machine learning based method to
generate cell type labels according to a reference dataset​2​, see ​Methods​. First the platelets
(PPBP, PF4) and epithelial cells (TPPP3, KRT18) clusters were excluded in the downstream
analysis. According to the published marker genes, which have been summarized in
Supplementary Data 2​, we divided the data into three populations: Lymphoid cells (CD3D,
CD3E, NKG7, NCAM1), Myeloid cells (CD68, CD14, FCGR3A, CD1C) and B cells (CD19,
MS4A1, CD79A, MZB1).

Differential expression and Gene Ontology analysis
To account for the technical effects such as number of cells or sequencing depth, the hurdle
model in MAST​37 was used to model the differential expression of the cells. Only the genes
with a false detection rate (FDR) lower than 0.01 was used for volcano plot and later gene
ontology analysis.

In the MAST results, the genes with a log fold change value greater than 0 are considered
as up-regulated genes, while the rest are the down-regulated genes. And the up-regulated
genes in a cell cluster are used for gene ontology analysis. The python package of
GProfiler​38 was used to understand the pathway regulation. The gene module scores for
HLA class II and ISG signature were calculated for each individual cell using
sc.tl.score_genes function of scanpy​39​ v1.5.1.

TCR/BCR analysis
The TCR and BCR V(D)J data from the studies Wen et al. 2020​4​, Zhang et al. 2020​3 and
Liao et al. 2020​9 (TCR only) were analyzed separately using the python library pyvdj​40
v0.1.2. For TCR V(D)J data, only cells with at least one productive TRA and at least one
productive TRB chain were considered for analysis. Similarly, for BCR V(D)J data, only cells
with at least one productive IGH and at least one productive IGL or IGK chain were
considered for analysis. The UMAP plots were generated using scanpy​39 v1.5.1. The
boxplots and barplots were generated using R-package ggplot2​41 v3.3.2, ggpubr​42
v0.4.0.999, rstatix​42,43​ v0.6.0.999 and tidyverse​44​ v1.3.0.
