Coronavirus sequence detection by CRISPR-Cas12

Abstract

20
21

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has received global

22

attention due to the recent outbreak in China. In this work, we report a CRISPR-Cas12 based

23

diagnostic tool to detect synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences in a proof-of-principle

24

evaluation. The test proved to be sensitive, rapid, and potentially portable. These key traits of

25

the CRISPR method are critical for virus detection in regions that lack resources to use the

26

currently available methods.

Introduction

29
30

The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus is clearly a major concern for countries across the

31

world. This virus is a single-stranded RNA virus with high sequence identity to SARS-CoV

32

and has, therefore, been named SARS-CoV-2. This coronavirus variant is capable of

33

transmission from person to person, which makes it a dangerous virus that can cause a

34

pandemic.

35
36

Several SARS-CoV-2 detection assays have been reported to be currently under

37

development. The WHO website provides information on several virus detection protocols

38

that have been used in different countries such as China, Germany, Japan, and the US, among

39

others (1). All these are real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) based assays, and

40

despite their established efficiency, require highly specialized personnel and expensive

41

equipment for implementation. In such a backdrop, any development toward ultrasensitive,

42

cheaper, and portable diagnostic tests for the assessment of suspected cases, regardless of the

presence of qualified personnel or sophisticated equipment for virus detection, could help

44

advance the diagnosis of COVID-19.

45
46

CRISPR is a biotechnological technique well-known for its use in gene editing. Notably,

47

CRISPR has been recently used for the in vitro detection of nucleic acids, thereby emerging

48

as a powerful and precise tool for molecular diagnosis (2-4). Within the CRISPR-Cas effector

49

family, Cas12 is a RNA-guided DNase belonging to the class II type V-A system that induces

50

indiscriminate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) collateral cleavage after target recognition.

51

This leads to the degradation of ssDNA reporters that, emit a fluorescence signal on cleavage

52

or alternatively, could be detected on a paper strip (by lateral flow) in a portable manner (5).

53

Therefore, CRISPR-Cas12 based tools possess the potential to emerge as an in situ diagnostic

54

tool for rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this work, we employed CRISPR-

55

Cas12a and its unspecific collateral ssDNAse activity to generate a fast, accurate, and

56

portable SARS-CoV-2 sequence detection method.

57
58

Materials and methods

59
60

For the detection assays, we included synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2

61

corresponding to the RdRp, ORF1b and ORF1ab genes, using the WH-human1 sequence

62

(GenBank MN908947) as a reference. Briefly, the SARS-CoV-2 fragments were synthesized

63

as complementary DNA oligonucleotides and treated with fill-in PCR (NEBNext® High-

64

Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix) to generate the DNA templates. These DNA templates were

65

transcribed into RNA using an in vitro transcription (IVT) Kit (Ambion, Invitrogen) under

66

the control of a T7 promoter.

A target amplification step was performed using the TwistAmp® Basic recombinase

69

polymerase amplification (RPA) kit (TwistDx, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and RT was

70

carried out by the addition of 5 μL of synthetic SARS-CoV-2-RNA input, 2.5 μL of M-

71

MuLV reverse transcriptase (NEB), and 1 µL of murine RNase inhibitor (NEB) in a 50 μL

72

final reaction volume. Reactions were run for 30 min at 42°C. The RT-RPA was carried out

73

in one step, with the same pair of primers for both reactions.

74
75

To generate the CRISPR-detection complex, we mixed 75 nM of the commercially available

76

LbCas12a endonuclease (NEB) with the same amount of single guide RNA (sgRNA)

77

synthesized in-house by hybridization of DNA oligonucleotides followed by fill-in PCR and

78

IVT. The complexation reaction was carried out in a solution containing 1X NEBuffer 2.1

79

(NEB) (composed of 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.9)

80

at room temperature for 10 min.

81
82

For plate reader-based assays, ssDNA reporters labeled with FAM were included in the

83

detection mix; while for portable detection with paper strips, ssDNA reporters labeled with

84

biotin were included. The reaction was initiated by diluting the LbCas12a complexes to a

85

final concentration of 37 nM LbCas12a : 37 nM sgRNA in a solution containing 1X

86

NEBuffer 2.1 (NEB) and 1 µM custom ssDNA reporter substrates in a 40 μL reaction

87

volume. A 2 μL aliquot of RT-RPA input was used. Reactions were incubated for up to 90

88

min at 37°C. Fluorescence measurements were acquired at 10 min intervals (λex: 485 nm and

89

λem: 535 nm) in a SpectraMax M2 fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices) operated in

90

the 384-well microplate format. For paper-based measurements, we used the Milenia

91

HybriDetect 1 (TwistDx) lateral flow system, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Finally,

92

we simulated a clinical sample by adding synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments (105

Results and Discussion

108
109

The best results were obtained in attempts to detect the ORF1ab region with primers

110

suggested by the China CDC (6). Based on visualization of these results in a fluorescence

111

spectrophotometer, the limit of detection (LOD) for ORF1ab coronavirus sequences was

112

estimated to be up to 10 copies/µL (figure 2 panel A of the accompanying figure), which is 4

orders of magnitude lower than the viral load found for the patient reported in Berlin (105

114

copies/µL) (7).

115
116

When assays were performed using a paper strip, we obtained a similar LOD, demonstrating

117

that the detection system could be rendered portable without loss in sensitivity (figure 2 panel

118

B of the accompanying figure).

Finally, we simulated a clinical sample by adding synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments to

131

saliva samples collected from a healthy person. There are advantages using saliva for the

132

diagnosis of COVID-19. Saliva specimens can be provided by the patient easily without any

133

invasive procedures (8). Positive results for this artificial saliva-sample were obtained using

134

the paper strip-based assay (figure 2 panel C). These latest results indicate that the CRISPR

135

detection system reported here was not inhibited by naturally occurring molecules in the

136

saliva and can reach real saliva specimens concentration (8), therefore, emerging to be a

137

promising method got the rapid and portable detection of clinical cases of COVID-19.

138
139

Conclusions

140
141

The current rRT-PCR-based COVID-19 diagnostic approaches have been shown to be very

142

efficient and accurate for virus detection. However, the virus can spread to regions where the

143

equipment required to perform rRT-PCR is not available. We demonstrated that the CRISPR-

144

Cas12 based detection method is characterized by a LOD value lower than the minimum

145

levels needed to presently detect the virus in clinical samples. The main advantage of the

146

CRISPR-diagnostic method reported here is its portability and low cost (USD 1-2/reaction)

147

(2). A possible criticism for this study is that the method has not been tested using patient

148

samples. This is because clinical cases have not yet been reported in our region (South

149

America). Nevertheless, our work represents a proof-of-principle study of the usefulness of

150

the CRISPR-Cas12 detection technology that could be deployed worldwide without the

151

requirement of sophisticated instrumentation.

While we were preparing this paper, another two protocols for SARS-CoV-2 detection using
CRISPR diagnostics (SHERLOCK, v.20200214; DETECTER v.20200215) was published,
confirming the potential of the technique.
