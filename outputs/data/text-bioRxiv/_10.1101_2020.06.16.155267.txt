Abstract
To understand the difference between benign and severe outcomes after Coronavirus
infection, we urgently need ways to clarify and quantify the time course of tissue and immune
responses. Here we re-analyze 72-hour time-series microarrays generated in 2013 by Sims and
collaborators for SARS-CoV-1 in vitro infection of a human lung epithelial cell line. Using a
Transcriptogram-based top-down approach, we identified three major, differentially-expressed
gene sets comprising 219 mainly immune-response-related genes. We identified timescales for
alterations in mitochondrial activity, signaling and transcription regulation of the innate and
adaptive immune systems and their relationship to viral titer. At the individual-gene level, EGR3
was significantly upregulated in infected cells. Similar activation in T-cells and fibroblasts in
infected lung could explain the T-cell anergy and eventual fibrosis seen in SARS-CoV-1 infection.
The methods can be applied to RNA data sets for SARS-CoV-2 to investigate the origin of
differential responses in different tissue types, or due to immune or preexisting conditions or to
compare cell culture, organoid culture, animal models and human-derived samples.

Introduction
Severe respiratory syndromes during the two previous major outbreaks of lethal Coronavirus,
SARS-CoV-1 in 2003 [1] and Middle-Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012 (for a Review,
see [2] and references therein), as well as the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, often result from
dysfunctional immune responses triggered by the interaction of the host immune system with
the virus [3,4]. While strong immune responses are essential to contain and clear viral infection,
excessive inflammation may damage tissues, delay tissue healing after viral clearance, and lead
to acute inflammatory responses and/or sepsis. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the degree and
severity of immune-response pathologies differs greatly between individuals: while 81% of
infected individuals show either mild or no symptoms, 14% patients develop severe pneumonia
and 5% develop acute respiratory critical conditions associated with multi-organ failure that
require intensive medical care and ventilation and may lead to life-threatening sequels or death
[5]. Mortality is higher in men than in women, strongly increases after 60 years of age and

increases with pre-existing co-morbidities including diabetes, obesity and cardio-vascular
diseases (https://globalhealth5050.org/covid19/). Because of the complexity of the many
patterns of response to SARS-CoV-2 we critically need ways to identify important biological
mechanisms which act at different phases of infection and allow us to reliably identify
differences in pathway and gene activity between individual patients, tissues within patients,
individuals with pre-exiting conditions, sex and ethnic differences and age. The immune system
is complex, sensitive and dynamic, with a delicate balance of triggers, high-gain feed-back loops,
and complex interactions between its many agents, complicating interpretation of experimental
measurements of immune-response components and the origins of their variation between
individuals. In this case, for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes, detailed
mathematical models of patient-specific immune responses might help us understand the range
of possible immune responses, and how they depend on patient-specific variables, ranging from
initial exposure level and coinfections, to age, sex, preexisting conditions and medications, etc.
Furthermore, besides those directly related to immune dysfunction, in serious cases COVID-19
symptoms may also include blood and vascular disruption, meaning that the co-activation of
other pathways with deleterious effects may play an important role in disease outcomes [6].
Both constructing mathematical models of a complex system like the human immune
response and validating such models sufficiently for use to propose therapies or assist with
diagnoses or prognoses requires integration of extensive data from in vitro, organoid and animal
experiments with the more limited clinical observations in humans. Acute inflammatory
responses lead to dramatic and rapid changes in expression of large numbers of genes, requiring
extensive transcriptome analyses to interpret. For construction and validation of immuneresponse models, qualitative information is insufficient; we also need specific quantitative
information on the time course of immune response and its relationship to viral titer.
Statistical analyses of transcriptome data are generally classified as either bottom-up,
starting by identifying differentially-expressed genes, clustering them into differentiallyexpressed pathways and then describing the biological functions these pathways alter, or topdown, starting by identifying altered biological functions, then refining the analysis to
hierarchically discover the relevant differently-expressed pathways and then genes. In cases of
immune-system response to viral infection, where changes in gene expression are genomewide, top-down approaches may be more practical, since the large number of differentiallyexpressed genes can be overwhelming to analyze and understand using bottom-up techniques.

RNA-Seq or microarray transcriptomes are affected by many sources of variability,
including differences in experimental techniques, biological differences between apparently
similar samples, and other confounding variables within samples, like the effect of cell-cycle
phase. Our Transcriptogram method to quantify whole-genome-level expression changes
reduces noise and enhances signal-to-noise ratio in transcriptome analyses, increasing the
power of statistical tests to identify significantly-affected pathways and timescales [7].
Transcriptograms provide a high-level visualization of significant changes in gene expression and
have proved useful in identifying relationships between pathways in fungi [8,9], plants [10,11],
and humans [12,13,7]. The Transcriptogramer software tool is freely available for download at
https://lief.if.ufrgs.br/pub/biosoftwarestranscriptogramer/ and has a Bioconductor application
[14].
Here, as a pattern for future Transcriptogram analyses of SARS-CoV-2 data and to
illustrate the power of the method in quantifying the detailed and complex temporal pattern of
immune response to viral infection in cell culture, we present Transcriptogram analyses for
SARS-CoV-1 time-series data sets of Sims et al. [15]. Sims et al. [15] infected cultures of a clonal
population of Calu3 2B4 cells, a lung adenocarcinoma cell line isolated from the pleural effusion
of a 25-year-old Caucasian male, sorted for high expression of the enzyme ACE-2, the cellular
receptor for SARS-CoV-1 (and SARS-CoV-2). They inoculated cultures with either a wild type
SARS-CoV-1 virus (WT samples) or a mutant SARS-CoV-1 strain (DORF6 samples) that does not
express the accessory protein ORF6 at high concentration (a multiplicity of infection MOI of 5),
so that the probability of cell contamination in the culture approached 1. As controls, they also
inoculated cultures with a sterile solution (Mock samples). After inoculation, they incubated the
cultures at 37oC for 40 min, then changed their medium. They then harvested samples for

time for the medium change or the time between inoculation and initial harvest, their data lack
a consistent time-0 data set and all time labels refer to the time after the first RNA harvest. As a
result, even at 0 ℎ, expression in the infected and control cultures differs (see below). We

analyzed these data because of the short time intervals between samples at early times, which
are critical to understanding the rapid changes occurring in tissue response to viral infection,
and the relatively long duration of the experiment. The experiments also have matched-time

Sims et al. focused their analyses on the role of ORF6 in the immune response,
examining the differences between the WT and DORF6 time series [15]. Here, we focus on largescale and single-gene transcriptomic changes caused by the WT virus w.r.t. the control. Our
analyses confirm that gene expression changes massively within 24 ℎ, but we also identified

relevant responses before 7 ℎ and complex temporal changes in expression throughout the time
course of the experiment. Our analyses identify specific additional significant changes in
expression in different pathways and individual immune-related genes at 12 ℎ, 36 ℎ and 54 ℎ.

We identified 219 genes with differential expression at some point of the time sequence and, to
illustrate the potential of our method, we selected 4 genes with large expression differences

w.r.t. to control for further scrutiny, EGR3, TWIST1, JUN, and TNFAIP3, all related to immune
response. To validate our findings, we also examined a pair of genes, HSD11B1 and HSD11B2,
with known associated effector action on Cortisol/Cortisone balance.

Statistical Methods
Overview and analyses pipeline
We performed a Transcriptogram-based [9,16] top-down analysis of whole-genome
transcriptome time-series for human epithelial cells cultures, comparing cultures inoculated
with either a mock or a SARS-CoV-1-containing (WT) solution. We first assessed patterns of
expression change shared by large numbers of genes, then considered smaller gene sets which
had strongly covariant temporal signatures and finally examined single genes whose variance
was statistically significant withing these sets. At each stage, we filtered the data based on the
statistical significance of the subseries variability. The next section briefly discusses the
Transcriptogram method and relevant parameters. We then present the data and
Transcriptograms for the Mock and Wild Type (WT) virus strain time courses, indicate the gene
sets we focus on and provide a genome-wide visualization of the main patterns of time evolution
for the covariance-clustered gene data, comparing the infected and non-infected samples. We
then consider the time evolution of 219 genes whose time courses show fold-changes larger
than two compared to their pair-matched Mock samples at at least one time point. We clustered
the genes by time-course similarity and identified 6 clusters. We determined the mean time
evolution for each cluster. Several of these clusters show complex non-monotonic time courses,
which we compare to the viral titer. From the changes in behaviors presented by the gene
clusters, we infer the typical patterns and timescales for Calu3 2B4 epithelial-cell immune
response to SARS-CoV-1 infection, correlate these timescales with viral titer and identify single
genes that may possible targets for therapy development.

Transcriptograms
Transcriptograms are expression profiles, obtained by running a window average for
expression levels of multiple genes, previously organized in an ordered gene list, representing
the whole human genome. Here we consider windows of radius 30, that is, intervals around a
given gene position including 30 genes to its left and 30 genes to its right in the ordered gene
list. Averaging over these intervals for each gene in the list produces a smoothed mean
expression profile. We generate the ordered gene list by first filtering gene products that share
at least one association as inferred from the STRING Protein-Protein Interaction database with
confidence scores of 800 or better [12]. The gene-list ordering clusters genes by their biological
function as defined in the STRING database. The ordered gene list we use for this analysis is
available as Table ST1 in supplementary information online. Ref. [12] explains the construction
of the gene list in detail. We then apply this ordered list of genes to analyze gene expression
data from micro-arrays or RNA-Seq experiments. Because the list clusters genes by attributed
function, the running window averages expression levels over genes believed to participate in
the same or similar biological functions.
One major problem in detecting differential gene expression in microarray or RNA-Seq
experiments is with the high variance of the data, that can result from measurement noise or
confounding variables that were not explicitly controlled for. Ref. [7] shows that
Transcriptograms can reduce the variance of gene expression measurements and enhance the
power of statistical tests when comparing gene expression levels between gene samples. We
characterize the ordered genes by projecting onto the gene list selected biological Gene

Ontology (GO) terms or KEGG pathways, to associate regions of the list with key biological
mechanisms.

Fig. 1 Gene list and enrichment of terms related to critical biological functions as a function of position in the
list. From left to right, in shades of purple, the list is enriched with genes associated with translation and
mRNA processing then pathways linked to the cell cycle. Next, in shades of blue, genes associated with cell
differentiation and, in shades of green, genes associated with immune response, cytokine production and
interaction with the extra-cellular matrix (ECM). Finally, shades of orange denote genes associated with
energy metabolism.

Fig. 1 shows term-enrichment profiles projected on the ordered list, obtained for
selected KEGG pathways and Gene Ontology: Biological function terms (GO:BP). The gene list
we use comprises 9684 genes, representing those genes whose products participate in at least
one Protein-Protein Interaction (with a score of 800 or better) as listed in STRING. The horizontal
axis (intrinsically numbered by gene position from 1 to 9684) has been rescaled to fit the interval
[0,1]. At each position in the gene list, represented by the horizontal axis, we plot the fraction
of genes within a window of radius 30 genes around that position associated with a specific term
or pathway. A profile value near 1 means that almost all genes in that interval link to the term.
Moving from left to right, we observe successive enrichment of terms associated with specific
biological functions: at the far left, we see enrichment linked to RNA processing and metabolism,
then enrichment related to the cell cycle, followed by cell differentiation, the actin cytoskeleton
and immune systems. Further to the right, we see enrichment for signaling pathways associated
with secretion, ECM receptors and finally, energy metabolism. Consequently, a running window

average of expression data over this ordering, averages the expression of genes linked to the
same or similar biological functions.

Normalization check using Transcriptograms
Transcriptograms provide a powerful test for sample normalization by revealing undesired
variable offsets in expression levels between samples. We ensure sample normalization we as
follows: we plotted the Transcriptograms of radius 30 for the normalized data available in the
GEO database (shown in Fig. S1 in the supplementary information online) and verified that each
sample set shows offsets in its mean in relation to the other sample sets. We then re-normalized
the expressions levels for each sample data set to set its mean expression to 1. Fig.S1 shows the
resulting renormalized, single-sample Transcriptograms.

Relative Transcriptograms
We obtain relative Transcriptograms by dividing the Transcriptogram profile values at each point
in the ordered gene list by the Transcriptogram profile value for a control sample at the same
position in the list.
Differential Transcriptograms
We obtain differential Transcriptograms between two time-series by obtaining the relative
Transcriptogram for the WT samples at a given time point w.r.t. time-matched Mock samples.
In a time-series for differential Transcriptograms the control sample is different for each time
point.
Term Enrichment
We determined term enrichment for the gene sets consisting of the genes in a given interval of
the ordered gene list using the Term Enrichment Panther Service, on the Amigo 2 home page
(http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo) [17,18,19].

We start our analysis of expression profiles for WT and Mock samples at different times
by generating relative Transcriptograms as described in the Statistical Methods section, taking
as the control the Transcriptogram for the Mock sample at time 0 ℎ (which is the time of the

first RNA harvest, at least 40 minutes after inoculation). Fig. 2 shows the relative
Transcriptograms at different times for Mock (blue lines) and WT (red lines) samples. The
relative Transcriptogram for the control expression levels (Mock samples at 0 ℎ) appears as a
black horizontal line. We also plot the relative Transcriptogram standard errors (due to the

variance among replicates) for each point of the ordering: these errors are represented by gray,
light red, and cyan shading around, respectively, the black, red and blue lines. The
Transcriptogram’s window average reduces the variance between replicates, so the error bars
are barely visible.
Fig. 2 presents the relative Transcriptogram profiles at 0 ℎ, 24 ℎ, and 48 ℎ after first

RNA harvest. The top panel shows that at 𝑡𝑡 = 0 ℎ (approximately 40 minutes after the viral

inoculation and washout at the start of the experiment) the Mock and WT samples are similar,
although in some regions the errors do not overlap (around gene positions 0.41 or 0.53, for
example), indicating that cells are already responding to viral infection at the time of first RNA
sampling. Fig. 2 shows that at 24 ℎ and 48 ℎ, the relative Transcriptogram profiles of both Mock

and WT samples differ significantly from the Mock sample mean profile at 0 ℎ. The direction of
deviations at a given gene location at 48 ℎ is typically the same as that at 24 ℎ, but of greater
amplitude. To identify intervals in the relative Transcriptograms with significant expression

variations, we define and consecutively label contiguous regions along the horizontal axis with
values larger than 9/5-fold changes in the WT Relative Transcriptogram values at 48 ℎ (labels
A1, A2,...,A11). From the many terms enriching each region (see Methods section) we select a

representative term as a label, based on the number of genes associated to that term in that
region.

Red and Blue lines represent the relative Transcriptograms for, respectively, WT and Mock samples. Gray, Light red
and cyan shading indicate the standard errors of the respective relative Transcriptograms. We identify 11 intervals,
indicated by the horizontal color bars, where the red line differs from the control by more than 9/5 at 48h.

seek to identify genes related to immune response, most of the bands of significant variance
correspond to regions enriched with genes participating in pathways linked to the immune
response. Genes linked to the cell-cycle I region (interval A2) are depressed in both Mock
samples and WT samples, probably reflecting contact inhibition of proliferation in confluent in
vitro cultures. However, Fig. S1 in the supplementary information online also shows that at 54 ℎ

WT samples show some expression recovery of genes linked to the cell cycle. This recovery may
reflect the onset of cell cycle after the death of some infected cells, which reduces contact

inhibition of proliferation, or another tissue-recover mechanism. Changes in expression across
multiple functional bands of the relative Transcriptogram appear at 24 ℎ. These bands stay fixed

in width but increase in amplitude until 54 ℎ, after which they slowly decrease in amplitude. For

more details on the changes in each band, refer to Fig. S2 and movies SM1 and SM2 in the
supplementary information online.
The important messages in Fig. 2 and S1 and the animation of the time changes of the
relative Transcriptograms in movies SM1 and SM2 are that: i) major changes in band expression
start after 12 ℎ; ii) the bands of expression change in amplitude but not in width, reflecting their

correspondence with changes in activity of specific biological mechanisms; and iii) gene
expression in the control samples also changes in time, because cell state changes in culture
conditions, even in the absence of infection.
To distinguish cell-culture effects, which affect both WT and control cultures, from the
effects of infection, we considered time-matched mock expression profiles as controls for the
WT expression profiles. We define the differential Transcriptogram profile as the ratio of the WT
transcriptogram value at a given time and gene position to the matched-time Mock
transcriptogram value at the same gene position. Using a time-matched control helps reduce
the signal from tissue-culture effects common to both WT and control samples and accentuates
specific differential infection effects. Differential profiles do not show changes in expression of
cell-cycle-related genes, for example, since both control and WT expression change in the same
way in time. Figure 3 shows differential profiles as violet lines, with the light violet shading
showing the standard error. The horizontal black line shows the control differential expression
profile for the Mock sample at the corresponding time. Fig. 3 presents the differential profiles
(WT(t)/Mock(t)) at three time points, Fig. S3 in the supplementary information online presents
the differential profiles for all time points and SM3 animates these time changes into a movie.
Differential Transcriptogram profiles show noticeable alterations after 12 ℎ . As before,

we to associate the most altered bands to biological functions and labeled used Panther to label
them accordingly. As in Fig. 2, the altered bands remain constant in width but change in
amplitude.

We next consider the time evolution of the differential expression (WT(𝑡𝑡)/Mock(𝑡𝑡)) of
the 590 individual genes that participate in the 17 bands identified as significantly differentially
expressed in the differential Transcriptograms in Fig. 3 (where we define a significant change as
either larger than 9/5 or less than 5/9). Table ST2 in the supplementary information online
presents these results as an Excel file containing the gene names and plots for each gene’s
relative and differential expression evolution, with brief information on each gene. Among these

590 genes, we found 219 for which the expression 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) at one or more time points 𝑡𝑡 differed

from the time-matched control 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) more than two fold (i.e. 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) > 2𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) or 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) <

0.5 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡)). Our significance limit is higher because here we are considering single-gene
differential expression, rather than the differential Transcriptogram values, which are averages
over the expression of neighboring genes in the list.
The Transcriptogram analyses identify 219 genes in differentially-expressed
Transcriptogram bands which are also individually differentially expressed relative to their timematched Mock samples. This gene set comprises the genes that respond more intensely to virus
inoculation. To identify their associated biological functions, we used the Over Representation
test

page

(http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo) to find the Reactome Pathways that enrich this set of
219 genes. Among others, we find that 51 of these genes participate in “Cytokine signaling in
immune system,” 36 participate in “Innate immune system,” 18 participate in “Toll-like-receptor
cascade,” 15 participate in “Interleukin 4 and Interleukin 13 signaling” and 8 genes are
participate in “TNFR2 non-canonical NF-κB´ pathways.” Table ST3 in the supplementary
information online gives the complete list of over-represented Reactome Pathways for the 219
genes (P<0.05, Buonferroni corrected). Of the 219 genes, 35 have not been classified as forming
a representative set for some Reactome Pathway. Thus 84% of the 219 significantly variant
genes participate in pathways either directly or indirectly involved in components of the immune
response.

Fig. 3. . Differential Transcriptograms WT(t)/Mock(t) (radius 30). Time is time after the first RNA harvest. Vertical axes
are on 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙2 scale. Black horizontal lines represent the control sample Mock(t)/Mock(t). Violet lines are the differential
Transcriptograms for WT(t)/Mock(t). Light violet shading indicates standard errors for WT Transcriptograms. We
identify 17 bands where the violet line differs from the control more than 9/5-fold at 24 h. The horizontal red lines
denote the 9/5-fold and 5/9-fold lines in all panels.

Proceeding with our top-down strategy, we look for temporal patterns in the differential
expression of single genes (not Transcriptogram values) related to immune response by
considering covariant gene sets for the 219 genes identified as presenting significantly different
single-gene expression time series among the 590 genes that participate in the significantly
different bands in the differential Transcriptograms in Fig.3. To find genes with similar patterns
of temporal evolution, we first calculated the covariance matrix for the differential expression
time series of the 219 genes (see Statistical methods section). When two genes have the same
pattern of time change of differential expression, their temporal covariance approaches one.
Using the covariance matrix, we order genes into covariance clusters (Fig. 4). We identify 3 large
clusters, A, B and C. The time changes of differential expression of genes in cluster D are less
strongly correlated than those in clusters A, B and C, so we have subdivided D into three more
strongly covariant sub-clusters, D1, D2 and D3. As discussed previously, the ordering of the gene

with one biological function may lead to activation of genes associated with different biological
functions, leading to temporal correlations in their differential expression patterns. Also,
different genes within a pathway may activate with different time patterns, reducing their
temporal covariance. Consequently, we do not expect the covariance matrix clusters to directly
correspond to the differential transcriptogram bands in Fig.3. Instead, Clusters A to D3 are
covariant gene sets for the genes which both Transcriptogram and single-gene analysis
identified as significantly differentially expressed in the present experiment. Table ST2 in the
supplementary materials online is an Excel file containing a separate worksheet for each of the
17 bands which the Transcriptogram analysis identified as significantly differentially expressed,
as shown in Fig. 3. For each of these bands, Table ST2 presents plots of the relative and
differential expression of the 219 genes, in different colors, depending on the time-series
pattern they follow. All bands have genes which belong to all covariant clusters, showing that
proximity in the ordered list does not correlate with covariant cluster identity.

Fig. 5 presents the time series for the differential expression of each gene in each cluster,
together with the cluster average of these values. Within clusters A, B, C, and D1, the genes have
similar patterns of change of differential expression in time. Clusters D2 and D3 show more
diverse temporal patterns of evolution. Fig. 6 summarizes the averaged temporal patterns of
differential gene expression of the clusters.

(112 genes) have highly covariant differential expression time series. Cluster D is subdivided in three sub-clusters: D1

D3. The large symbols show the average differential expression vs time for each cluster. Table ST2, in the

calculated P values to assess significant differences in mean differential expression at each timepoint across clusters. We present these results in Table 2.
Fig. 6 shows the temporal pattern of response in the infected cells triggered by virus
inoculation together with the time evolution of the viral titer, reproduced from Ref. [15],
measured in units of PFU/ml (plaque forming units per milliliter) for 6 samples for each time
point. We can observe that:
1) Viral titer initially decreases from 0 ℎ to 3 ℎ, then increase rapidly from 3 ℎ to 36 ℎ,
decrease between 36 ℎ and 48 ℎ, then increase to a small, but statistically

significant second maximum at 54 ℎ, and finally decrease from 54 ℎ to the end of

the experiment. The first genes to respond significantly to viral inoculation belong

to cluster B´. Cluster B’ is the only cluster whose mean expression is significantly
different from Mock sample expression before 12 ℎ (see Table 2).

2) In Cluster A (40 genes) average differential expression does not differ significantly
from the control until 12 ℎ. Between 12 ℎ and 54 ℎ its average differential

expression decreases, reaching a minimum at 54 ℎ. After 54 ℎ average differential

expression increases until the end of the experiment but always remains less than
0.5. This cluster is enriched in genes involved in mitochondrial activity. Shi and
collaborators showed that the SARS-CoV-1 protein designated opening reading
frame-9b (ORF-9B) localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane, manipulating
host-cell mitochondria, and disturbing mitochondrial anti-viral signaling [20]. This
interference could explain why Cluster A’s mean differential expression moves
opposite to the viral titer.
3) The genes in Cluster B´ (40+7+12 genes) have the richest temporal dynamics of
mean differential expression. At 0 ℎ, differential expression is already depressed in

the WT relative to the control, indicating that some genes change their expression

very rapidly w.r.t. the control, during the 40 min incubation time before RNA
harvesting (0 ℎ). Average differential expression increases between 0 ℎ and 7 ℎ

then decreases until 12 ℎ, then increases again, reaching a maximum at 30 ℎ. It

then decreases until 48 ℎ, then increases to a second, more modest maximum, at
54 ℎ and finally decreases until the end of the experiment. Although the maximum

at 54 ℎ is modest in amplitude, it is statistically significant and coincides with the

minimum value of the average differential gene expression in Cluster A and the
second peak in viral titer, suggesting that it reflects a real change in biological
function. The term enrichment analysis for Cluster B showed that 36 of the 40 genes
in this cluster participate in Gene Ontology (GO) terms linked to “response to

stimulus,” with 13 specifically tagged as “response to cytokines.” The great majority
of the products of these genes localize either to the extracellular matrix, indicating
signaling activity, or to the nucleus, indicating response to signaling. The other two
clusters forming cluster B´, Cluster D1 (7 genes) contains genes associated with
terms for ion transport, potassium included, while Cluster D2 (12 genes) contains a
diverse spectrum of genes that all associate with the broad GO term “Immune
Response.”
4) In Cluster C (112 genes), after 12 ℎ mean differential expression increases

monotonically to a maximum at 54 ℎ after which it decreases until the end of the
experiment. This maximum at 54 ℎ coincides with the maximum at 54 ℎ in Cluster

B´, the minimum in Cluster A, and the modest second peak in viral titer. Term
enrichment analysis of the genes in Cluster C shows that the great majority of these
genes have GO annotations involved in “immune response and signaling,” including
“production and regulation of cytokines” (58 genes), ``I-kappaB kinase/Nf-kappaB
signaling´´ (19 genes),``response to hormone´´ (19 genes), and ``innate and adaptive
immune response´´.
5) In Cluster D2 (8 genes) mean differential expression (Fig. 6 inset) increases
monotonically after 12 ℎ. The individual gene differential expression time series

show that this increase is due to a strong monotonic increase of CCL5 differential
expression(see Fig. 5, right-middle panel), a chemoattractant for blood monocytes,
memory T-helper cells and eosinophils. The other genes present significant
differential expression only at a few time points and their time series show modest
differential expression as compared to CCL5. Also, their differential expression time
series have different patterns: some monotonically increase, others are more stable
in time, and a few first, then recover after 36 ℎ.

the first phase, denoted by a pale-pink background, clusters A and C have differential expression near 1, while cluster
B’ differential expression moves opposite to the viral titer. In the second phase, denoted by a pale-blue background,
average differential expression in cluster A decreases monotonically while average differential expression in both
clusters B’ and C increase similarly, in parallel with increasing viral titer. In the third phase, denoted by a pale-yellow
background, differential expression in clusters B’ and C diverge after the viral titer reaches its maximum, with Cluster
B´ tracking viral titer evolution. After 54 ℎ, however, viral titer and the average differential expression of clusters B´
and C decrease while average differential expression in cluster A increases.

Table 1. P values for the time series depicted in Fig. 6.

In summary, we have identified three gene clusters (A, B´, and C) with distinct temporal
evolution. Clusters B´ and C have the most distinctive patterns of temporal change, probably
reflecting their specific functional roles during early infection. To illustrate the power of our
method, we selected six genes from these clusters and analyzed their differential expression
evolution. We then discuss their possible roles in the cellular response to virus inoculation.
We begin by considering the gene pair HSD11B1 (from cluster C) and HSD11B2 (from
cluster B´). Both genes are linked to Cortisone-Cortisol balance. Cortisol is anti-inflammatory, is
secreted by the adrenal gland, is present in plasma, and can be converted to inactive Cortisone
by the enzyme 11-beta-hidroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD-2), the product of the
HSD11B2 gene (For a review, see [21]). The time series for HSD11B2 presented in the middleleft panel of Fig. 5 (red line), shows that its differential expression in infected cells begins to
increase after 12 ℎ up to 36 ℎ reaching a 32-fold change w.r.t. control, after which it gradually

decreases to an 8-fold change . The reduction in anti-inflammatory Cortisol signaling between
12 ℎ and 36 ℎ probably enhances pro-inflammatory signaling in response to infection. HSD11B1
differential expression also starts increasing after 12 ℎ, but peaks later, at about 54 ℎ, as shown

in the bottom-left panel of Fig. 5 (red line). 11-beta-hidroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD-

1), the product of the gene HSD11B1, converts Cortisone back into Cortisol, possibly restoring
anti-inflammatory signaling, after the initial pro-inflammatory response. The data shows the
time evolution for the well-known interplay between Cortisone-Cortisol.

Fig. 5, bottom-left panel (olive green) highlights the differential expression evolution of
JUN and TNFAIP3 from cluster B. JUN encodes c-Jun, a protein that participates in the
transcription-factor complex “Activator Protein-1” (AP-1) that has complex context-dependent
behaviors [22]. In epithelial cells AP-1 components (containing c-Jun) may participate in
apoptosis or cell proliferation. JUN differential expression evolution seems to increase with viral
titer with a few hours of delay. Cell cycle mean expression is depressed in both Mock and WT
samples compared to Mock sample expression at 0 ℎ (the interval marked A2 in Fig. 2 and Fig.

S1 in the supplemental information online), probably due to contact inhibition in the culture.
However, Fig. S1 shows that cell-cycle gene expression recovers after 60 ℎ. Both apoptosis and

proliferation may occur in the infected culture. The observed time series for JUN differential

expression may relate to these differences in cell cycle-related expression between WT and
Mock samples.
TNFAIP3 encodes the protein A20, a negative regulator of the NF-κB protein complex.
TNFAIP3 is thus a negative regulator of inflammation and is known to be rapidly induced after
Toll-like receptors interact with a pathogen or respond to TNF-α or IL-1 cytokines [22]. The
bottom-left panel in Fig. 5, shows a peak for differential expression of TNFAIP3 at 48 ℎ, followed

by monotonic decrease until the end of the experiment. Comparing the time-series for the

differential expression of TNFAIP3 shown in the bottom-left panel in Fig. 5 with the viral titer
evolution in Fig. 6, we may infer that TNFAIP3 follows the viral titer with about a 4 ℎ delay. This
temporal relationship suggests that the anti-inflammatory response due to TNFAIP3 in the WT
sample gradually decreases as the viral titer decreases.
Fig. 5, middle-left panel shows the dynamics of differential expression of individual
genes in cluster B. We have highlighted in navy blue the expression of EGR3 and TWIST1, the
two genes whose differential expression presents the largest fold changes in cluster B. TWIST1
negatively regulates the NF-κB protein complex. TWIST1 is thus anti-inflammatory [23]. The
variation in the TWIST1 time series in the middle-left panel of Fig. 5 generally follows the viral
titer evolution in Fig. 6. EGR3 is a zinc-finger transcription factor of the Early Growth
Transcription family (EGR) that responds early to environmental stimuli to induce cell
proliferation, differentiation, and immune responses [24]. In resting epithelial cells, EGR3 is
usually weakly expressed, but a wide variety of extracellular signals such as cytokines and T-cell
receptor (TCR) activation can promote EGR3 expression [24]. Fig. 5 middle-left panel shows that
EGR3 differential expression increases after 12 ℎ and remains high, varying between 16- and 32-

fold change from 20 ℎ to 54 ℎ, then decreasing when the viral titer begins to decrease after
54 ℎ (Fig. 6). This correspondence suggests that the virus may activate EGR3 in epithelial cells.

If the virus also promotes EGR3 in T cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells it could explain T-cell

anergy in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection in T cells, since the co-activation of T-cell
receptors by antigen and EGR3 may lead to T cell anergy [25,26]. Furthermore, EGR3 regulates
fibrogenic responses in fibroblasts [27], and EGR3 may cause vascular disruption when active in
vascular endothelial cells [28]. The infected lung contains epithelial cells, T-cells, fibroblasts, and
endothelial cells, all of which express the ACE-2 receptor for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 [29].
Both T-cell depletion due exhaustion or anergy, and fibrotic sequels have been reported in SARSCoV-1 [30] and SARS-CoV-2 [31] patients. We wonder whether these effects on T-cells and
fibroblasts may correlate with the activation of EGR3 by the virus. Also, since EGR3 activates
VEGF in endothelial cells [28], its activation in infected cells may link to the endothelialitis,
thrombosis, and angiogenesis reported in COVID-19 [6].

Conclusions and Perspectives
Transcriptogram analysis of microarray time series by Sims et al. [15] for SARS-CoV-1
infection of Calu3-2B4 cells, a human epithelial cell line, selected for ACE-2 expression [9]
identifies three main gene sets with well-defined dynamics, summarized in Fig. 6. Differential
expression profiles indicate that some cell responses (Cluster B´) begin very soon after
inoculation, and that mitochondrial activity decreases until 54 ℎ, then partially recovers.

Considering that clusters B´ and C consist mostly of genes associated with immune response,
our results show that the dynamics of these genes in response to viral inoculation follows two

different time-evolution patterns. While Cluster B´ consists mainly of genes related to innate
immune response, Cluster C comprises genes related to both innate and adaptive immune
responses. Because mathematical models usually consider variables that aggregate the effect of
multiple genes into broad representations of classes of biological mechanisms or pathways,
these mean differential expression time series can serve as direct validation data for
mathematical models of epithelial-cell responses to SARS-CoV-1 infection. Beyond pro/antiinflammatory signaling via, for example, the negative regulation of NF-κB complex by TNFAIP3
and the interplay between HSD11B1 and HSDB11B2 differential expression, the genes in each
cluster suggest that the response to viral inoculation also includes regulation of apoptosis and
proliferation, via JUN, and has secondary effects on cell differentiation (with different possible
outcomes, depending on the cell type), via EGR3. These effects follow the temporal patterns of
either Cluster B´ or Cluster C suggesting coordinated patters of cellular responses. Because the
Transcriptogram analysis selects genes most functionally relevant to the specific behavioral
changes in a particular experiment, we could identify the correlated responses of genes
annotated to different pathways or GO terms (which would be hard to identify if we conducted

correlation analyses of the temporal expression changes of all genes at once). The differential
Transcriptogram, by identifying differential expression bands of functionally related genes,
greatly reduces the number of “genes of interest” making their detailed temporal analysis
practical.
Because gene expression changes in control samples in cell culture as well as in infected
samples, using time-matched gene expression controls is critical to distinguish cell-culture
effects from infection effects.
Our analysis identified six genes which we analyzed in more detail. We chose four
because they had time series with the largest fold-changes in their clusters: JUN and TNFAIP3
from cluster C and TWIST1 and EGR3 from Cluster B´. We discussed their roles in the anti-viral
immune response in detail in the last section.
EGR3 activation relates to the virus using ACE-2 to invade the cell. EGR3 activation may
explain a number of symptoms in patients with severe responses to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV2 infection. Other cell types in the infected lung may be infected by the virus: in particular, if
EGR3 activation also occurs in infected T-cells, it could explain T-cell anergy (against viral
antigens), in infected fibroblasts, it could link to observed fibrosis, and in infected endothelial
cells, it could explain the endothelialitis, thrombosis, and angiogenesis reported in COVID-19.
Our analysis also identified as differentially expressed two genes from a well-known
feed-back loop which regulates Cortisol-Cortisone balance. Infection perturbs the resting
Cortisone-Cortisol homeostasis and we would expect that each gene would follow a different
time course in response to infection. We find that differential expression of the proinflammatory
HSD11B2 follows Cluster B´ and peaks with viral titer, while the anti-inflammatory HSD11B1
follows Cluster C and peaks later. We will examine the remaining 213 genes iidentified as
signifiant by our Transcriptogram analsysis in future work
Our Transcriptogram method hierarchically prioritizes groups of differentiallyexpressed genes by first considering those bands in the ordered list with the most altered
expression w.r.t. to the control. This filtering reduces the number of genes of interest to a
tractable set and suggests shared mechanistic functions for the observed gene expression
patterns. These gene sets are defined by the data directly, not by reference to previouslydefined pathways or biological functions. We could apply the same methodology to identify
functional differences between cell-culture responses to SARS-CoV-1 infection between malederived and female derived cells or between adult-derived and juvenile-derived cells (to identify
sex-linked and age-linked changes in response pattern). The same methods could identify critical
differences in cell responses to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection or among responses to
infection by other respiratory viruses. We could also study differences in response between cells
