Background: Health workers involved in COVID-19 response might be at risk of developing

20

fear and psychological distress. This study aimed to identify factors associated with COVID-19

21

fear among health workers in Nepal during the early phase of pandemic.

22

Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in the month of April-May 2020

23

among 475 health workers directly involved in COVID-19 management. The Fear Scale of

24

COVID 19 (FCV-19S) was used to measure the status of fear. Scatter plots were used to observe

25

the relationship between fear and other psychological outcomes: anxiety, depression and

26

insomnia. Multivariable logistic regression was done to identify factors associated with COVID

27

fear.

28

Results: COVID-19 fear score was moderately correlated with anxiety and depression, and

29

weakly correlated with insomnia (p<0.001). Nurses (AOR=2.29; 95% CI: 1.23-4.26), health

30

workers experiencing stigma (AOR=1.83; 95% CI: 1.12-2.73), those working in affected

31

district(AOR=1.76; 95% CI: 1.12-2.77) and presence of family member with chronic diseases

32

(AOR=1.50; 95% CI: 1.01-2.25) was associated with higher odds of developing COVID-19 fear

33

as compared to other health workers, health workers not experiencing stigma, working in non-

34

affected district and not having family member with chronic diseases respectively .

35

Conclusion: Nurses, health workers facing stigma, those working in affect district and having

36

family member with chronic diseases were more at risk of developing COVID-19 fear. It is thus

37

recommended to improve work environment to reduce fear among health workers, employ

38

stigma reduction interventions, and ensure personal and family support for those having family

39

member with chronic diseases.

Introduction

42

The psychological implications as a result of disease outbreak is often neglected by the health

43

system[1-3] although studies have found that the proportion of mental health effects is higher

44

than the effect of particular disease during the epidemics[4]. COVID-19 is burdening the health

45

systems including health workforce and paralyzing economies across the world. Nepal, a South

46

Asian country, ranking low in health security index (111 out of 195 countries[5] is not an

47

exception from the threat of COVID-19. The country reported its first case on January 23[6] and

48

the total infection toll has reached to 168.235 along with 920 deaths as of October 30, 2020[7].

49

The increasing rate of the infection is putting a strain on its already compromised health system

50

[8]. Health care workers who are at the frontline of managing of COVID 19 are prone to

51

developing psychological outcome as they work in a stressful situation[9]. Early evidence has

52

shown increased work pressure, inadequate protective measures, risk of infection, and

53

transmitting infection to family members, limited organizational support and exhaustion

54

contributing to adverse mental outcomes including fear in health workers [3,10-12].

55

Fear and stress experienced by health workers affect their work, behaviour and health outcomes

56

[13,14]. The understanding of fear and other psychological outcomes among health workers has

57

not much received attention during the pandemic. There are limited published studies which

58

have investigated the mental health impact of COVID-19 among health workers in Nepal

59

[15,16]. In this regard, this study aims to assess the status of COVID-19 fear among health

60

workers involved in COVID-19 response in a low resource setting. In addition, it aims to explore

61

the relationship of COVID-19 fear with other mental health outcomes among health workers.

63

Study design, participants and procedures

64

A total of 475 health workers participated in the study. A web-based cross-sectional survey was

65

conducted among health workers directly involved in COVID-19 management in between April

66

26 to May 12 in 2020. Social media groups of professional organizations were identified and

67

health workers were requested for their interest to participate in the study. Those health workers

68

who expressed interest were personally invited to fill up the Google forms. The inclusion criteria

69

for the study were those aged 18 years and above, currently working in Nepal, and involved in

70

COVID-19 response. The study protocol was approved by Ethical Review Board of Nepal

71

Health Research Council (Registration number: 2192; 315/2020).

72

Measures

73

The fear scale of COVID 19 (FCV-19S) was used in the study for assessing the fear among

74

health workers. It is a relatively new scale developed by Ahorsu et al in 2020 [14] and has been

75

used in different countries including India[9], Bangladesh[17], Israel[18], Italy[19], Turkey[20]

76

and Eastern Europe[21]. The FCV-19S has seven items and five point likert scales ranging from

77

1 to 5 with lower and higher value indicating strongly disagree and strongly agree respectively.

78

The total scores ranges between 7 to 35 and the higher the score, the higher the fear of COVID-

79

19. Similarly, the 14 item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used for

80

measuring anxiety (HADS-A, 7 item) and depression (HADS-D, 7 item), and 7 item Insomnia

81

Severity Index (ISI) was used for measuring insomnia.

82

Socio-demographic information of the study participants was collected which included age (up to

83

40, >40 years), gender (male, female), ethnicity (Brahmin/Chhetri, Janajati and others),

84

educational qualification (Intermediate and below, bachelor and masters), marital status (single,

ever married), family type (nuclear and joint), profession (doctors, nurses, others), living with

86

children (yes, no), living with older adults (yes, no), presence of chronic disease among family

87

members (yes, no) and history of medication for mental health problems (yes, no). Similarly,

88

work related variables included type of health facility (primary, secondary and tertiary), work

89

experience (up to 5 and >5 years), work role in COVID-19 response (frontline, second line),

90

adequacy of precautionary measures in work place, (not sufficient, sufficient) aware of

91

government incentives for health workers (yes, no), perceived stigma (yes, no, do not want to

92

answer), working in affected district (yes, no) working overtime (yes, no) and change in regular

93

job duty during COVID-19 (yes, no). Working in affected district was defined as district with at

94

least one case during the time of data collection.

95

Data analysis

96

The socio-demographic and job related characteristics, and item wise response of the FCV-19S

97

were presented in frequency and percentage. Similarly, psychometric properties of the tool were

98

calculated and presented in S1 Table. The pattern of relationship between FCV-19S and other

99

psychometric tools (HADS-A, HADS-D and ISI) were explored by using scatter plots and

100

calculating correlation coefficient (Figure 1 and S2 Table). The COVID-19 fear score was

101

categorized as presence of fear and absence of fear of COVID-19 based on the median value.

102

Those having scored more than median (>16) were categorized as presence of fear and less than

103

or equal to as absence of fear of COVID-19. Chi-square test was done between categorical

104

independent and categorical dependent variable (S3 Table) and those variables significant at 10%

105

significance level were fitted in the multivariable logistic regression model. In the regression

106

model, the effects of gender, ethnicity, profession, education, working in affected district, family

107

member with chronic disease, faced stigma, precautionary measures in work place, awareness

108

about government incentive and history of medication for mental health problem was

109

adjusted[22]. One of the independent variables, history of medication for mental health problem

110

was also fitted into the model though it was not significant in the bivariate analysis as it was

111

supposed to alter psychological outcomes[23]. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was

112

measured before conducting multivariable logistic regression analysis which did not detect

113

multicollinearity (VIF value less than 1.3).

114

Results

115

Tables 1 show the socio-demographic and job related characteristics of health workers. Among

116

475 health workers, 52.6% of them were female and 65.9% belonged to Brahmin/Chhetri ethnic

117

group. The professional category comprised of nurses (35.2%), doctors (33.9%), paramedics

118

(17.9%) and remaining were other health professionals. Likewise, 25.1% were living with

119

children, 34.3% were living with elderly, 54.5% had a family member with chronic medical

120

condition and 4.6% had a history of medication for mental health problems. Majority of the

121

health workers in this study (82.3%) worked in either secondary or tertiary level health facility.

122

The proportion of health workers reporting insufficient precautionary measures in the workplace,

123

facing stigma, aware of government incentives for health workers, change in job duties during

124

COVID-19 and working overtime was 78.9%, 53.7%, 56.8%, 70.3% and 49.1% respectively.

Correlation of FCV-19 S with HADS-A, HADS-D and ISI

138

The correlation analysis showed that FCV-19S was moderately correlated with HADS-A (r=

140

p<0.001). The seven items of the FCV-19S were either weakly or moderately correlated with

141

HADS-A, HADS-D and ISI (p<0.001) (S2 Table). The scatter plot showing the relationship

142

between anxiety and fear, depression and fear, and insomnia and fear adjusted for age and sex is

Predictors of COVID-19 fear among health workers

153

The bivariate analysis between socio-demographic and job related characteristics is presented in

154

S3 Table. The proportion of COVID-19 fear among health workers in this study was 46.1 %

155

(219/475). In the adjusted analysis, profession, stigma experience, working in affected district

156

and having family member with chronic disease was significantly associated with COVID fear.

157

As compared to other health workers, nurses (AOR=2.29; 95% CI: 1.23-4.26) had significantly

158

higher odds of having COVID fear. Similarly, health workers working in affected district

161

significantly higher odds of having COVID fear as compared to those not working in affected

162

district, not having a family member with chronic disease, and those not facing stigma

163

respectively. Gender, ethnicity, education, precautionary measures, awareness about government

164

incentive and history of medication for mental health problems was however not statistically

165

significant with COVID fear (Table 3).

Discussion

169

This study documents the factors associated with the presence of fear related to COVID-19

170

among health workers in Nepal in the early phase of the pandemic. The study identified

171

profession, working in the affected region, presence of family member with chronic disease and

172

stigma faced by health workers as significant factors contributing to the presence of fear among

173

health workers. In this study, nurses were significantly more likely to have COVID fear than

174

other health workers. This might be because of their role in providing patient care more closely,

175

frequently and for longer hours compared to other health workers. The chance of being infected

176

and transmitting infection to others, dealing with the disease that is highly infective and the

177

uniqueness of the cases might have led to increased fear among nurses. Similar findings were

178

noted in studies conducted in other countries that have reported COVID-19 cases and countries

179

that have handled epidemics like SARS in the past [24-27]. Effective strategies to reduce fear

180

with focus on nurses are thus required to avert COVID fear and psychological distress.

181

In our study, more than half of the health workers experienced stigma during COVID-19.

182

Stigma faced by health workers was also significantly associated with the higher odds of

183

presence of fear of COVID-19. Already vulnerable due to exposure to possible infections,

184

emotional exhaustion due to increasing workload, deployment to newer settings like fever clinics

185

and lack of adequate PPEs, health workers are more likely to face stigma either internalized or

186

from public which will impair their performance in COVID-19 response[28]. Stigma reduction

187

strategies should thus be employed for educating the public which need to include proper

188

messaging through mass media and community engagement activities[29,30]. Equally important

189

is to identify the underlying causes of stigma experienced by health works during the epidemic.

190

Working in the affected district was significantly associated with the presence of fear among

191

health workers. This is obvious as health workers working in the affected districts need to

192

directly deal with COVID-19 patients or those at risk of infection. Health workers in Hubei

193

province of China[24] during COVID pandemic and health workers directly involved in the care

194

of patients in Canada[31] during SARS epidemic also faced more psychological distress as

195

compared to those not involved in the direct care of COVID patients or less affected areas. As

196

fear among health workers reflects their psychological wellbeing, health workers working in risk

197

districts should be supported emotionally and due attention is required on their workload, safety

198

needs and other personal and family concerns.

199

In this study, presence of family member with chronic disease had higher odds of presence of

200

COVID-19 fear. The fear of transmission to family members and the vulnerability posed by

201

chronic disease conditions might have resulted in higher degree of fear among health workers.

202

This finding is similar to the study from China[32] where health workers were concerned with

203

the infection of their family members. Personal and family support is thus required for health

204

workers having family member with chronic diseases.

205

Our study findings showed COVID fear was moderately correlated with anxiety and depression

206

suggesting detrimental effect of COVID fear to psychological well-being. Perhaps, symptoms of

207

anxiety and depression were a consequence of working in a high fear environment for an

208

extended period. It is thus necessary to develop an enabling work environment where health

209

workers feel protected and are motivated to confront COVID-19 and other similar epidemics.

210

Health facility managers need to monitor the psychological well-being of their staffs and ensure

211

proper psychological intervention measures are adopted timely and precisely. In this study, only

212

one out of five health workers mentioned protective measures in their workplace as sufficient.

213

Similarly, just over a half of health workers were aware of the government incentives entitled to

214

them during COVID-19. This clearly reflects the need to improve organizational and policy

215

aspects for boosting the work morale of health workers to reduce fear and psychological distress

216

among health workers involved in COVID-19 response.

217

Majority of the socio-demographic and job related characteristics including work role,

218

precautionary measures in the work place, working overtime and awareness regarding incentives

219

were not significantly associated with the fear of COVID-19. Further follow-up studies might be

220

required among health workers to understand the effect of socio-demographic and job related

221

characteristics in psychological outcome such as fear.

222

Our study has some limitations to be noted. This study was conducted during the early phase of

223

the pandemic in Nepal when less than 300 COVID-19 cases were reported. The status of fear

224

might have altered thereafter as COVID-19 cases continue to increase in Nepal. Similarly,

225

participation in this study required internet access and the survey was administered in English

226

language. This might have left out health workers who did not have internet access and had

227

difficulty in comprehending English language. Similarly, the results might have been affected by

228

subjective response. The feeling of uncertainty about the scale and duration of the epidemic, no

229

known medication or vaccine, widespread media coverage and news about surge of cases and

230

deaths in various affluent countries with sophisticated health system and lack of adequate testing

231

facilities might also have accentuated the perceived level of fear among healthcare workers.

232

Despite limitations, this study employs FCV-19S to measure the status of fear among health

233

workers and identify those at risk of developing fear. The evidence generated can be useful to

234

those at decision making level and health facility managers for designing appropriate

235

interventions to enhance psychological well-being among health workers in this and similar

236

epidemics in the future.

237

Conclusion

238

This study showed a considerate proportion of COVID fear among health workers during the

239

early phase of pandemic in Nepal. Nurses, health workers working in affected district, those

240

facing stigma and having family member with chronic diseases were significantly more likely to

241

have COVID fear than other health workers, health workers working in non-affected district,

242

those with no stigma experience and those not having a family member with chronic disease.

243

Based on the study findings, it is recommended to focus on strategies to improve work

244

environment to reduce fear among health workers, conduct stigma reduction activities, and

ensure personal and family support for health workers having family member with chronic

diseases.
