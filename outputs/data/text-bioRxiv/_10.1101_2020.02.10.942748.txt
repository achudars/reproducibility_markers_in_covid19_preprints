Abstract
The recent outbreak of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, underscores the need for
understanding the evolutionary processes that drive the emergence and adaptation of zoonotic viruses
in humans. Here, we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses, including human-infecting viruses
like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the
Spike gene. We find that this common process likely led to a recombination event at least 11 years ago
in an ancestor of the SARS-CoV-2 involving the RBD. As a result of this recombination event, SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a similar genotype in RBD, including two insertions (positions 432-436 and
460-472), and alleles 427N and 436Y. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that interacts with the
human ACE2 receptor. Ancestral state analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 differentiated from its most
recent common ancestor with RaTG13 by accumulating a significant number of amino acid changes in
the RBD. In sum, we propose a two-hit scenario in the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus whereby the
SARS-CoV-2 ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV by incorporation of a
SARS-like RBD through recombination before 2009, and subsequently, the lineage that led to SARSCoV-2 accumulated further, unique changes specifically in the RBD.

Introduction
In the three months since the initial reports in mid-December 2019, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has
caused close to 10,000 fatalities associated with severe respiratory disease worldwide1. The causative
agent of COVID-19 was identified as a previously unknown RNA coronavirus (CoV) virus, dubbed SARSCoV-2, of the betacoronavirus genus2, with 80% similarity at nucleotide level to the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus3. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the only members of
Sarbecovirus subgenus of betacoronavirus that are known to infect humans. Other members of this
subgenus are frequently found in bats, hypothesized to be the natural reservoir of many zoonotic
coronaviruses4. In January 2020, a Rhinolophus affinis bat isolate obtained in 2013 from the Yunnan
Province in China (named RaTG13) was reported to have 96% similarity to SARS-CoV-25, suggesting
that the ancestors of the outbreak virus were recently circulating in bats. However, the specific molecular
and evolutionary determinants that enable a virus like the recent ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 to jump
species remain poorly characterized.
The capability of viral populations to emerge in new hosts can be explained by factors such as rapid
mutation rates and recombination6 which lead to both high genetic variability and high evolutionary rates
(estimated to be between 10-4 and 10-3 substitutions per site per year)7. Previous genome-wide analyses
in coronaviruses have estimated that their evolutionary rates are of the same order of magnitude as in
other fast-evolving RNA viruses8,9. Recombination in RNA viruses, known to be frequent in coronaviruses,
can lead to the acquisition of genetic material from other viral strains10. Indeed, recombination has been
proposed to play a major role in the generation of new coronavirus lineages such as SARS-CoV10.
Furthermore, a recent study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 was involved in a potential recombination event
between different members of the Sarbecovirus subgenus2.
In this work, we investigate the evolutionary events that characterize the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. In
particular, we identify one recombination event in a region that determines host tropism, the Receptor
Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike gene, which led human SARS and SARS-CoV-2 to share a similar
haplotype in the RBD. Through ancestral reconstruction analyses, we also observe that, subsequent to
this recombination, a significant enrichment of nonsynymous changes occurred in SARS-CoV-2 after the
split from its most recent common ancestor (MRCA) with RaTG13.

Results
Recombination hotspots in betacoronavirus
To understand how recombination contributes to the evolution of betacoronaviruses across different viral
subgenera and hosts, we analyzed 45 betacoronavirus sequences from the five major subgenera
infecting

mammals

(Embevovirus,

Merbecovirus,

Nobecovirus,

11

Sarbecovirus)(Supplementary Table 1) . Using the RPDv4 package

12

Hibecovirus

and

to identify recombination

breakpoints, we identified 103 recombination events (Figure 1a, Methods). Enrichment analysis indicates
that recombination often involves the n-terminus of the Spike protein that includes the Receptor Binding
Domain (RBP) (adjusted p-val. < 10-4, binomial test on sliding window of 800 nucleotides) (Figure 1b,
Supplementary Figure 1). This enrichment of recombination events persisted after restricting the analysis
to the most common host (bats), suggesting that the recombination is not driven by sampling of multiple
human sequences (Supplementary Figure 2). In all, we find that recombination in betacoronavirus
frequently involves the Spike protein across viral subgenenera and hosts.
MERS-CoV recombination frequently involves the Spike gene
To study how recombination affects emerging human betacoronaviruses viruses at the viral species level,
we focused our attention to the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), due to the
extensive sampling both in humans and in camels (recognized as the source of the recent zoonosis13).
Using 381 MERS-CoV sequences (170 from human, 209 from camel and 2 from bat) (Supplementary
Table 2) we show that the Spike region overlaps with the majority of recombination segments (83%, 20
of 24 identified events) (Figure 2a) with an enrichment of recombination breakpoints detected in the Spike
and Membrane genes (Figure 2b, Supplementary Figure 3). This effect was not observed when restricting
the analysis to human MERS-CoV samples only (n=170) possibly due to the lower number and diversity
of sequences available (Supplementary Figure 4). We thus show that the enrichment of recombination
events involving the Spike gene is also observed at a viral species level.
Identification of a recombination event involving SARS-CoV-2 in RBD of Spike gene
We then asked if any signal of recombination could be found in the recent history of SARS-CoV-2. We
first perform sliding phylogenetics showing topological incongruences between phylogenies involving
three sections of the Spike gene: the 5’, the RBD and the 3’ (Figure 3a), supporting potential
recombination within the Spike gene involving the RBD domain. In addition, recombination analysis
performed with the RDP4 package detected a significant recombination event (genome positions 2261423032) affecting SARS-CoV-2 and the human SARS-CoV in the RBD (p-val. < 0.003, RDP, Bootscan,
Maxchi and Chimaera), recapitulating the result of Wu et al.2

We then analyzed the consensus amino acid sequences within the RBD region involved in this
recombination event, comparing the clade affected by the recombination to the clade consisting of the
closest bat SARS-like CoVs (including KY770859, KJ473816, MG772933, MG772934 and KY417145 –
Supplementary Figure 5). The two consensus sequences differed in 62 codon positions including two
insertions spanning the 432-436 and 466-472 regions. Interestingly, out of these 62 changes, 23 amino
acids are conserved in human SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Table 3), including four
positions that are conserved in the human-infecting viral strains but that are not conserved in those
infecting bats: 427N, 436Y, 455I and 466N. In summary, these results demonstrate, first of all, that SARSCoV-2 displays a genotype similar to SARS-CoV in the RBD, and secondly, that these two lineages share
a common history of recombination in the RBD.
To trace back the potential time of the recombination event involving ancestral lineages of SARS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2, we used a Bayesian Phylogenetic approach14 in the recombinant region (codons 200500 in the Spike gene) and compared with the whole genome phylogeny (Figure 3b). As in the full
genome phylogeny, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 were in the same clade, with human SARS-CoV as an
outgroup. In light of these results, there two possible scenarios to consider. The first is that SARS-CoV2 derives from a recombination event between human SARS-CoV and another (unsampled) SARS-like
CoV. The second is that there occurred at least two different recombination events, one leading to human
SARS-CoV and another one leading to SARS-CoV-2. In either of these two scenarios, the inferred the
time to the most recent common ancestor in the recombinant region of the clade leading to RaTG13 and
SARS-CoV-2 is no later than 2009 (2003-2013, 95% HPD limit).
Conserved mutations in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD
We highlight two mutations, 427N and 436Y, conserved in human SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and humaninfecting strains, but that are not conserved in other CoVs that only infect bats. Both mutations belong to
the short helix (427-436) of Spike (Figure 4c, Supplementary Figure 6) which lies at the interface of the
human ACE2 receptor with the Spike protein. Furthermore, site 436Y appears to form a hydrogen bond
with 38D in ACE2 (Figure 4c), likely contributing to the stability of the complex, which is disrupted by the
mutation Y436F15 (that is present in RaTG13). The second mutation that we identified, K427N, may
disrupt the short helix and cause the loop to shift, further affecting stability (Supplementary Figure 6).
These two positions, 436Y and 427N, which are present in all SARS-CoV-2 isolates, are also found in
viruses from other hosts, including civets (Paguma larvata) (Supplementary Table 4). Interestingly, a
mouse-adapted SARS virus showed a mutation at position 436 (Y436H) that enhanced the replication
and pathogenesis in mice16,17, indicating that this change may have an effect in host tropism. It is
noteworthy that unlike 436Y, 455I and 466N, the 427N mutation was present in the closest strains not

involved in the recombination event (KY770859 and KJ473816), suggesting that it appeared in their
MRCA through point mutation. Our ancestral state reconstructions also suggest that 427N has appeared
at two other independent times in bat SARS-like CoVs, and only at external branches (sequences
JX993988 and JX993987; Supplementary Figure 5). Other bat isolates with the 427N allele, such as
Rs7327, Rs4874 and Rs4231, are known to co-opt the human ACE2 receptor18, further reinforcing the
role of 427N as an adaptive mutation for the interaction with ACE2.
Recent substitutions in SARS-CoV-2 RBD
We compared the SARS-CoV-2 sequence to that of the genome-wide nearest bat CoV, namely RaTG13.
The distributions of nonsynonymous and 4-fold degenerate site changes between SARS-CoV-2 and
RaTG13 across the viral genome highlighted two regions with significant enrichment of nonsynonymous
changes (adjusted p-val. < 10-5 and p-val. < 10-3 for the first and second regions respectively, binomial
test on sliding windows of 267 amino acids) (Figure 4b). The first region, with windows starting between
positions 801 and 1067 in the Orf1a gene in our analysis, spans the non-structural proteins (nsp) 2 and
3 that were previously reported to accrue a high number of mutations between bat and SARS CoVs19
and includes the ubiquitin-like domain 1, a glutamic acid-rich hypervariable region, and the SARS-unique
domain of nsp320 that is critical to replication and transcription21,22. The second region that we found with
high divergence from the RaTG13 bat virus contained 27 substitutions in the Spike protein, of which 20
were located in the RBD (Supplementary Table 5). There was no significant enrichment in mutations
observed at 4-fold degenerate sites (Supplementary Figures 7-10).
Trough ancestral state reconstruction, we then inferred the entire Spike sequence of the most recent
common ancestor (MRCA) of RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2. We assessed the changes that were specific
to the lineage leading to SARS-CoV-2 and identified 32 substitutions (of which 2 only were in the RBD)
at 4-fold degenerated sites, and 10 amino acid changes (of which 5 were in the RBD) which have likely
occurred in the lineage leading to SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Table 6). Thus, we report a significant
enrichment of nonsynonymous changes in the RBD (Fisher Exact Test: p-value =0.005; Odds Ratio =
13.6, 95% Confidence Interval = 1.7 – 180.0). The five amino acid changes in RBD were I428L, A430S,
K465T and Y484Q. Interestingly, position 484 has already been reported to directly interact with ACE223.

Discussion
In this work, we have analyzed the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and its closest relatives. We suggest a twohit scenario involving both ancestral recombination and recent mutational events in the lineage that led
to SARS-CoV-2. It has been hypothesized previously that recombination8,24 and rapid evolution was
observed between bat, civet and human SARS-CoVs19. We show that the recombination events
preferentially affect the RBD region in the Spike gene, both at the order of genus (betacoronavirus) and
related species (MERS-CoV). We show that a recombination in this region occurred before 2009 involving
a common ancestor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In this recombination event, SARS-CoV-2 acquired
more than 20 amino acids characteristic of SARS-CoV and its closest relatives. The similarities between
both SARS-CoVs suggest that they share the same cell tropism25,26.
Interestingly, positions 427N and 436Y are retained in human sarbecoviruses but are not conserved
among non-human strains, suggesting that they might be relevant for human infection but not necessary
for infecting other hosts. Indeed, position 436 in Spike is part of the RBD-ACE2 interface, while position
427 is proximal to others such as 426 which are key for the strength of the RBD-ACE2 interaction23, 26.
The lineage that gave rise to SARS-CoV-2 underwent further differentiation from its MRCA with RaTG13,
accumulating mutations in key positions of the RBD, such as 484Q, and the insertion of a four amino
acids long polybasic cleavage site. The insertion of the polybasic cleavage site is unique to SARS-CoV2 among other Sarbecoviruses, and occurred between Spike positions 666-667 (using SARS-CoV
NC_004718 reference sequence coordinates). The presence of polybasic cleavage sites has been
associated in other viruses such as Influenza with high pathogenicity26, 27. Indeed, experimental analyses
that introduced such sites in the S1-S2 junction of human SARS-CoV have observed an increase of cellcell fusion without affecting viral entry28, 29.
In conclusion, our evolutionary analyses have revealed that the evolutionary processes leading to SARSCoV-2 can be explained by a two-hit scenario of recombination and recent mutational events in the Spike.

Fig. 1 | Recombination analysis of betacoronaviruses. a. Distribution of 103 inferred recombination
events among human and non-human beta-CoV isolates showing the span of each recombinant region
along the viral genome with respect to SARS-CoV coordinates. The spike protein and its RBD are
highlighted. b. Sliding window analysis shows (blue curve) the distribution of recombination breakpoints
(either start or end) in 800 nucleotide (nt) length windows upstream (namely, in the 5’ to 3’ direction) of
every nt position along the viral genome. The spike protein, and in particular the RBD and its immediate
downstream region, are significantly enriched in recombination breakpoints in betacoronaviruses.
Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) corrected p-values are shown (red curve), and the 5% BY FDR is shown for
reference (dotted line).

Sliding window analysis shows (blue curve) the distribution of recombination breakpoints (either start or
end) in 800 nucleotide (nt) length windows upstream (namely, in the 5’ to 3’ direction) of every nt position
along the viral genome. The spike protein, and the RBD in particular, overlap with widows that are
enriched in recombination breakpoints. Binomial test p-values (red curve) and the 5% significance level

Fig. 3 | Recombination event in an ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 encompasses the RBD of the Spike
gene. a. Full genome phylogenetic tree inference (top) shows SARS-CoV-2 sequence (HUMAN WuhanCoV) and its nearest bat-infecting RaTG13 strain clustering in a clade separate from the SARS-CoV
isolates from human and bats (BAT and HUMAN SARS lineages) with respect to an outlying and more
distant BAT sequence (Hp.betaCoV). Phylogenetic reconstruction (only 3rd codon positions) in the region
of spike containing the RBD, on the other hand (bottom), shows the SARS-CoV-2 lineage clustering
together with the HUMAN SARS strain. This change in tree topology gives evidence of a likely
recombination in Beta-CoV encompassing the RBD which leads to the appearance of the Wuhan strain.
Accession numbers: BAT Hp.betaCoV (KF636752); HUMAN SARS (FJ882963);

BAT SARS

(DQ071615); BAT SARS seq2 (DQ412043); RaTG13 (MN996532); SARS-CoV-2 (isolate 403962). b.
Dated phylogeny of the RBD including RaTG13, 3 sequences from SARS-CoV-2 (red), 6 Bat SARS-like
CoV (black) and 9 Human SARS CoV sequences (blue). The inference suggests possible scenarios with
one recombination at least 11 years ago (highlighted as red dot), but possibly as long as 28 years ago
(blue dot).

Fig. 4 | Two-hit scenario for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. a. Phylogenetic representation
summarizing the evolutionary events that likely led to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2: hit 1)
Recombination of the RBD of the Spike protein between the lineage ancestral to both SARS-COV-2 and
RaTG13 (red star) and the ancestral lineage of the human SARS-CoV (blue star); hit 2) SARS-CoV-2
accumulated five AA mutations in RBD since its divergece from its MRCA. b. Sliding window analysis
(length 267 aa) identifies specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 with high divergence from the RaTG13 bat
virus in the RBD of Spike (including 427N and 436Y), as well as in the Ubl1, HRV and SUD domains of
nsp3 (non-structural protein 3) within the orf1a polyprotein. c. Interaction between the human ACE2
receptor (green) and the spike protein (yellow) based on SARS coronavirus (PDB accession code: 2AJF).
Substitutions in SARS-CoV-2 at positions 427N and 436Y belong to a helix (blue) situated at the interface
of the interaction with ACE2. Detail: site 436Y (red) forms a hydrogen bond (dashed yellow line) with
38D (purple) in ACE2, likely contributing to the stability of the complex.

Online Methods:
Sample collection
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS/SARS-like-CoV
A set of 71 genome sequences derived from SARS-CoV-2 (which represent all genome availability at
GISAID on February 7, 2020; gisaid.org) was analyzed together with its closest animal-infecting relative,
RaTG13 (accession number MN996532), and other genome sequences from human SARS-CoV (n=72)
and bat SARS-like CoV (n=39), publicly available in Genbank (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)
(Supplementary Table 7). Alignment was performed either at genome wide nucleotide level or at the
Spike CDS (at amino acid level)independently with MAFFTv7 (“auto” strategy)30.
Seven recombination detection methods implemented in the RDP4 software package (RDP, Geneconv,
Bootscan, Maxchi, Chimaera, SiScan, 3seq)12 were used to detect evidence of recombination with default
parameters (p-value = 0.05, Bonferroni corrected), and depict the distribution of recombination events, in
different CoV alignments:
1- The following selection of viral strains was used in order to find breakpoints involving SARS-CoV2: KF636752 (bat), NC_004718 (human SARS), DQ071615 (bat SARS-like CoV), DQ412043 (bat
SARS-like CoV), MG772934 (bat SARS-like CoV, MN996532 (RaTG13), NC_045512 (SARSCoV-2).
2- A MERS-CoV genome alignment (n= 381; n= 170 human, n= 209 camel, and 2 bat sequences).
3- A betacoronavirus alignment (n=45 sequences, covering the genus diversity as in Lu, R. et al.,
202011).
Phylogenetic analysis
The evolutionary relationships between SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS/SARS-like CoVs was inferred from
genome alignment using PhyML (GTR + GAMMA 4CAT)31. The same program and model were used to
reconstruct the phylogenetic tree of the (potentially recombinant) RBD, using only 3rd codon positions.
Dated phylogeny of the RBD was obtained with BEAST v1.8.4 (Supplementary Table 8), after assessing
the molecular clock signal of the selected sequences with TempEst32. The analysis was performed with
the GTR+ GAMMA (4 cat) substitution model combined with an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock
model and the Bayesian Skyline Plot demographic model. We used as prior distribution for the time to
most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) a normal distribution with mean 40 years (standard deviation 10
years), as previously inferred7. Two independent runs of BEAST were performed, with MCMC chain
lengths of 5x107 states. Convergence of the estimated parameters was confirmed with Tracer
http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/.

Ancestral state reconstruction
The evolutionary changes that occurred in the Spike gene in Sarbecoviruses, either at amino acid level
or 4-fold degenerated sites, were traced using a continuous-time Markov chain model for ancestral state
reconstruction implemented in the Ape R package33. As input, the ML tree derived from 3rd codon
positions at the RBD recombinant region was used. We then compared the distribution of synonymous
and nonsynonymous substitutions along the branch specific to SARS-CoV-2.
Statistical analysis
Sliding window analysis was performed in order to test for enrichment of recombination breakpoints
(including both start and end breakpoints) along the viral genome in the following settings: 1) all betaCoV recombinations; 2) recombinations within non-human lineages for Beta-CoV; 2) all MERS-CoV
recombinations; and 3) both human-specific and non-human MERS-CoV lineage recombinations
separately. There were too few human-specific recombinations in beta-CoV for in-depth analysis. For
beta-CoV analyses, the SARS-CoV genomic coordinates were used as reference (accession
NC_004718), whereas for MERS CoVs, we used a MERS-CoV sequence (accession NC_019843) as
reference. Windows of 800 nucleotides were selected and binomial tests for the number of breakpoints
in each window were performed under the null hypothesis that recombination breakpoints are distributed
uniformly along the genome. Given the co-dependence structure of our statistical tests, adjustments were
performed using the Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) procedure34 which provides a conservative multiple
hypothesis correction that applies in arbitrary dependence conditions. For statistical significance, we
chose 5% BY false discovery rate (FDR). Our discoveries are valid with different choices of window length,
provided the window length is sensitive to the scale CoV proteins and the length of specific domains such
as the RBD in the Spike gene.
We used the same sliding window approach to test for enrichment of gene-specific nonsynonymous as
well as synonymous differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat virus RaTG13. For consistency, we
selected 267 length windows of amino acids (corresponding to approximately 800 nucleotides) and
performed p-value correction using the same procedure.
