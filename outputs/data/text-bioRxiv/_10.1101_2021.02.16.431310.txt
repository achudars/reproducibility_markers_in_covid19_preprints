Abstract
Rationally designed protein subunit vaccines are being developed for a variety of viruses including
influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2 and HIV. These vaccines are based on stabilized versions of the
primary targets of neutralizing antibodies on the viral surface, namely viral fusion glycoproteins.
While these immunogens display the epitopes of potent neutralizing antibodies, they also present
epitopes recognized by non or weakly neutralizing (“off-target”) antibodies. Using our recently
developed electron microscopy epitope mapping approach, we have uncovered a phenomenon
wherein off-target antibodies elicited by HIV trimer subunit vaccines cause the otherwise highly
stabilized trimeric proteins to degrade into cognate protomers. Further, we show that these
protomers expose an expanded suite of off-target epitopes, normally occluded inside the prefusion
conformation of trimer, that subsequently elicit further off-target antibody responses. Our study
provides critical insights for further improvement of HIV subunit trimer vaccines for future rounds
of the iterative vaccine design process.
Introduction
HIV infects approximately 1.7 million individuals each year, with an estimated 38 million
currently living with the virus (unaids.org). While there are a large number of anti-retroviral
therapies available, a vaccine would be the most effective measure for controlling the spread of
the virus and best hope for eventual eradication. To that end there are a number of parallel efforts
being developed at preclinical and clinical stages that employ a stable, soluble HIV envelope
glycoprotein (Env) trimer as a protein subunit immunogen(1). In preclinical animal models,
variants of these trimers have elicited consistent autologous and sporadic heterologous neutralizing
antibody responses against difficult-to-neutralize Tier 2 viruses(2–5). Although these results are
encouraging, there is still much work to be done to elicit broad and potent immune responses. To
this end there are significant efforts to understand the types of immune responses elicited by
various trimer vaccine candidates in great detail. As such, elucidating on- and off-target
(neutralizing and non-neutralizing) antibody responses elicited by these trimers remains a critical
component for immunogen redesign and the iterative, rational vaccine design process(6, 7).
Env is an inherently metastable protein because it must undergo drastic conformational changes to
drive entry of the virus into the host cell. Broadly neutralizing antibody epitopes are only present
on the prefusion conformation of Env, and therefore rational vaccine design is focused on
producing this form of Env(1, 8). Most of the current soluble Env trimer immunogens are based
on the SOSIP design that includes a disulfide bond which links gp120 to gp41 and an isoleucine
to proline mutation in the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) region that stabilizes the pre-fusion conformation
of the trimer(3, 9–11). Further, truncating the gene at residue 664 improves solubility and
monodispersity of the trimer(12). Such trimers are designed to antigenically mimic native envelope
trimers (Env), including glycosylation(13–16), while also being soluble and highly stable. Soluble
HIV Env trimer immunogen design has increased trimer stabilization to above 75 degrees
Celsius(17). These highly stable trimers mask internal and undesirable epitopes exposed on gp120
or non-native versions of Env, and exhibit an antigenic profile that preferentially exposes
neutralizing epitopes and not non-neutralizing, and otherwise immunodominant, epitopes(18).
Despite being highly stable with antigenically optimized surfaces, the HIV Env trimers described
above still elicit strong non-neutralizing antibody responses(6, 7, 18). Hence, the trimers require

iterative improvement via testing in animals, characterization of elicited antibodies, mapping of
epitopes, and further redesign. To accelerate this process we recently described a new technique,
electron microscopy polyclonal epitope mapping (EMPEM), which is a relatively high throughput
and comprehensive assay for mapping antibody responses in polyclonal sera(6). To conduct
EMPEM studies immunoglobulins from the sera or plasma of infected or vaccinated animals are
isolated, made into complexes with protein subunit vaccines, and then imaged and reconstructed
using single particle electron microscopy(6). Because of the speed and information content
generated by EMPEM, it has become an increasingly valuable tool for informing immunogen
redesign, particularly for identifying on- and off-target antibody responses(7).
We previously showed that base binding antibodies appeared after the priming immunization in
rabbits and were present, typically at increasing abundance, after subsequent booster
immunizations(6). Immune responses to soluble Env trimer vaccination have also revealed an
abundance of elicited base-binding antibodies(4, 7, 19). Some estimates for base-directed
responses are greater than 90%, which is a highly unproductive skewing of antibodies away from
the relevant neutralizing epitopes(18). Recently, Moyer et al. attached Env trimers to alum via a
C-terminal phosphoserine tag at the base of the trimer in an attempt to mask off-target base
antibodies in rabbits(20). EMPEM analysis revealed that the Alum-trimer complex did not
completely prevent base responses although there was a greater diversity of antibodies bound to
neutralizing epitopes outside the base, particularly at the earlier timepoints. These data suggest
that blunting of the base response early on increased the diversity of epitopes targeted, including
neutralizing epitopes(20). Other attempts to mask the base via attachment of Env trimers to
nanoparticles have only had limited success(21).
While the trimer base is typically an irrelevant and undesirable epitope, a few broadly neutralizing
antibodies (bnAb) targeting an epitope near the base have been described. Monoclonal antibody
(mAb) 35O22 binds parallel to the viral membrane at the base along a conserved region at the
gp120/gp41 interface and neutralizes 62% of 181 pseudoviruses with IC50 <50ug/mL(22).
Glycans located near the gp120/gp41 interface, including N88, are among the most conserved on
Env(22). Antibodies such as 3BC315 and 1C2 bind at the gp120/gp41 interface to an overlapping
but unique epitope from 35O22. Strikingly, binding of these bnAbs causes the Env trimer to fall
apart into its protomer components(4, 23) by disrupting the tryptophan clasp that stabilizes the
base of the trimer(24). Importantly, all of the known neutralizing base antibodies approach the
bottom of the trimer from an angle roughly parallel to the membrane while the non-nAbs approach
the base at a steeper angle that would clash with the membrane. This angle of approach makes it
relatively easy to differentiate neutralizing from non-neutralizing antibodies via EMPEM.
While trimer degradation is a potential mechanism for viral neutralization, it is confined to a small
subset of antibodies described above that meet specific criteria. Here, we demonstrate that there
are also classes of base-directed, non-neutralizing antibodies that cause soluble Env trimers to
disassemble into protomers. All Envs that we have examined degrade in this manner, and we have
observed this phenomenon using sera from both rabbits and NHPs. Most perniciously, secondary
antibody responses to internal, non-neutralizing epitopes demonstrate that antibody induced trimer
degradation happens in vivo and may further thwart productive immune responses.

Highly stabilized Env trimers can degrade into component protomers
Single particle negative stain electron microscopy (nsEM) is a simple and quick technique to assess
sample purity and map antibody epitopes on viral glycoproteins(6, 25–28). This technique has now
become commonplace for evaluating the homogeneity and native-like conformation of HIV
envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimers being developed as protein subunit immunogens. In this
study, we conducted EMPEM using various serum antibodies elicited by different stabilized Env
trimers. Within each set of 2D classes we observed a range of phenotypes including intact trimers
bound to fragments antigen binding (Fabs) (Fig. 1) as well as monomeric Env, or protomers, bound
to Fabs (Fig. 1B). These protomers are compact and appear to remain in the prefusion
conformation, likely due to the engineered stabilizing mutations that include a disulfide bond that
links gp120 to gp41 and an isoleucine to proline mutation in the heptad repeat region of gp41 that
prevents the conformational transition into an extended helix(3, 9–11), as well as others. Given
the relative abundance of protomeric species in different Env trimer samples imaged for EMPEM
analysis, we undertook a systematic study to further investigate the causes and effects of trimer
degradation into protomers.
Some base-binding antibodies cause trimer degradation
Prior to immunogenicity, antigenicity, or high-resolution structural studies, we routinely evaluate
Env trimers by single particle EM to ensure homogeneous distribution of prefusion conformation
trimer (Fig. 2A and fig. S1). For epitope mapping, we typically incubate trimers overnight with an
excess of Fab (either monoclonal or polyclonal), and the resulting complexes are purified using
size exclusion chromatography and deposited onto negative stain EM grids.
Using Env trimers of various subtypes and serum Fabs from different animal models immunized
with soluble Env trimers (rabbits, macaques), we observed a range of trimeric and protomeric EnvFab complexes (Fig. 2B to F and fig. S2 to S6). Consistent with previous observations, we noted
a large percentage of trimers with Fabs bound to the immunodominant base epitope (Fig. 2,B to
F). We also observed 2D classes of protomers that were highly decorated with Fabs (Fig. 2,C to
F). The extended structure and globular gp120 head of the protomer was readily distinguishable in
the 2D images, enabling relative locations of bound Fabs to be estimated (Fig. 2E). Notably, in
nearly all 2D class averages of protomers there was a Fab bound to the base (Fig. 2,B to F).
In some studies, we observed almost no intact trimers with overnight incubation, although shorter
incubation times with Fabs (30-60 minutes) could be used to increase the percentage of intact
trimers. When rh2688 serum Fabs were added to the MT145KdV5 SOSIP.664 Env trimer(27) for
30 minutes and then deposited on an EM grid, base binding antibodies bound to trimers were
visible in 2D classes, but protomers were not yet observed (Fig. 2B). For comparison, the same
sample when incubated overnight, resulted in extensive trimer disassembly (Fig. 2C). Notably,
trimers alone when incubated overnight do not decompose into protomers (Fig. 2A). These
observations are consistent with a mechanism in which antibody binding drives the degradation
process.
Close inspection of some 2D images revealed that Fabs were bound to both sides of the Env
protomer (Fig. 2C, D, F), suggesting that at least some Fabs recognized epitopes not exposed on
an intact Env trimer. For B cells to gain access to those off-target neo-epitopes and generate an

antibody response, the trimer must therefore degrade in vivo. While the 2D images are quite
revealing we could not generate stable 3D reconstructions of the protomers, consistent with a high
degree of heterogeneity.
Antibody-dependent trimer degradation increases over the course of vaccination
In our previous EMPEM study of serial vaccinations in rabbits, we showed a progression in
antibody responses starting with base-binding antibodies, with some animals going on to develop
neutralizing antibodies to the glycan hole epitope(25). Based on the observations described above,
we went back and reanalyzed these data to investigate whether trimer degradation also occurred
in that experiment. Because we had collected data after the priming and each of the boosts, we
were also able to monitor how trimer degradation evolved over time. Two weeks after the priming
vaccination using BG505 SOSIP.664 Env, nsEM showed either unliganded Env or base-binding
antibodies bound to trimer (Fig. 3A and fig. S7). At 6 weeks post immunization and 2 weeks after
a boost, nsEM showed base-binding antibodies and protomers with Fabs bound (Fig. 3B and fig.
S8). A cartoon depiction (Fig. 3E) shows the progress of trimer disassembly in vivo. Base-binding
antibodies appear first but may not necessarily cause the trimer to disassemble. As the immune
response progresses, base-binding antibodies bind at higher stoichiometry and drive the trimer
disassembly phenotype. The resulting protomers then present internal epitopes to the immune
system and elicit additional off-target responses. In some cases, the secondary antibody responses
are quite extensive and 5-6 Fabs can be visualized bound to a single protomer (Fig. 2,C to D, 3C
to D and fig. S9). These undesirable epitopes appear highly immunogenic and may therefore
distract the immune system from focusing on the more desirable protective broadly neutralizing
epitopes.
Broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies can also cause trimer degradation
In previous studies, we also observed timer degradation into protomers in the presence of the
bnAbs 3BC315 and 1C2(4, 29). Both antibodies bind the base of the Env trimer and interact with
gp120 and gp41 (Fig. 4). A long HCDR3 wedges itself into the gp120/gp41 interface and disrupts
the tryptophan clasp region. This insertion causes a conformational change in gp41 that leads to
destabilization and degradation. RM20C, which was recently isolated from a BG505 SOSIP.664immunized macaque, binds to the base of the trimer and causes degradation into protomers when
incubated overnight (Fig. 5A and fig. S10). Interestingly, RM20C does not neutralize BG505 virus
as an IgG but can weakly neutralize as a Fab, consistent with the hypothesis that the disposition of
the second Fab arm and Fc can sterically inhibit access to the base epitope on intact virions(26).
Therefore, although the base epitope shared by two known bnAbs and one autologous neutralizing
Fab, is a bona fide site of vulnerability, access is highly constrained. Binding to this epitope in the
context of the soluble trimer immunogen does not have the same constraints. Thus, nonneutralizing antibodies that approach the trimer at a steeper angle than 3BC315 and 1C2, which
approach parallel to the membrane, or have the heavy chain of the antibody positioned lower than
the light chain, which is likely the case for RM20C, are most likely the driving force in polyclonal
serum that causes trimer degradation(26).
Additional disulfide bonds and chemical crosslinking prevent trimer degradation
While antibody-induced trimer degradation appears to be a problem for many of the current Env
trimers being used for immunogenicity studies, there are versions of the trimer resistant to this
phenotype. We recently demonstrated that an advanced version of the ConM SOSIP trimer (ConM

SOSIP.664.v9) that includes an engineered inter-protomer disulfide bond between residues 72 and
564 resists serum-induced degradation that was observed in the parental ConM SOSIP.v7(21). An
inter-protomer disulfide between residues 501 and 663 of the 16055 Env was also recently reported
to prevent native flexibility linked (NFL) trimer degradation induced by bnAbs 3BC315 or 1C2(4,
30). This disulfide bond is an alternative to the traditional 501 to 605 disulfide present in previously
described SOSIP trimers. Here we introduced this disulfide bond into the fully-cleaved version of
the BG505 Env trimer (referred to as BG505v5.2 CC2). The BG505v5.2 CC2 trimer binds to
3BC315, but resists trimer degradation following overnight incubation. Additionally, BG505-CC2
could bind sCD4, but did not undergo a CD4-induced conformational change(4). The CC2
disulfide also knocked out binding to RM20C Fab (Fig. 5B and fig. S11).
Chemical cross-linking, is another potential remedy for trimer disassembly. To test this we
incubated BG505 SOSIP.664 trimers that had been crosslinked using 1-ethyl-3-(3dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC)(31) with serum from BG505 SOSIP.664 immunized
macaques. The parental BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer readily degrades into protomers while the EDC
crosslinked trimers remained resistant to disassembly. EDC crosslinked trimers could also bind
RM20C Fab, but resisted degradation following overnight incubation (Fig. 5C, D and fig. S12,
S13).
Discussion
On the surface of the virion, Env is membrane bound. Despite close juxtaposition to the membrane
epitopes near the base of the trimer (e.g. 3BC315, 35022, and 1C2)(4, 22, 23) and the highly
conserved membrane proximal external region (MPER)(32, 33), are accessible to neutralizing
antibodies. Soluble Env trimers truncated at residue 664 expose a large peptidic surface at the base
of the trimer that is not accessible on membrane bound Env. Without the membrane or gp41
glycans, the exposed base has emerged as an easy target for antibodies and therefore of the
immunodominant response in different animal models(6, 7, 18, 19).
Given the high thermal stability of these trimers and elicitation of neutralizing antibodies, it has
been assumed that the trimers stay intact in vivo. Here, we show that, in addition to being offtarget and immunodominant, base-directed responses that bind at or around the Trp clasp induce
disassembly of the trimer into protomers. Somewhat ironically this immunodominant response
targets what can be a bnAb epitope, but one which is highly sensitive to the angle of approach
and/or heavy/light chain disposition. Dissociated protomers then become immunogenic in their
own right, eliciting a second wave of non-neutralizing antibodies that target epitopes that reside
inside the native trimer. As these epitopes are relatively large continuous peptidic surfaces devoid
of glycans, like the base of the trimer, they are easier targets for recognition by B-cells than the
highly glycosylated exterior surface of the trimer. Thus, the immunogenicity of the trimer base
represents a doubly confounding effect on neutralizing antibody responses to the trimer. While
trimer degradation has occurred in all trimers that we have analyzed so far, the susceptibility and
timing of degradation varied by subtype and design. Some, like BG505 SOSIP.664, are less
susceptible while others, such as ConM SOSIP.v7, MT145KdV5 or CRF250 SOSIP.664(27, 34),
are much more prone to antibody-dependent degradation. Antibody-induced degradation of
trimers may also have implications for binding and antigenicity studies such as Octet or ELISA
and may therefore confound interpretation.

Encouragingly, Env trimer constructs already exist that contain inter-protomer disulfide bonds that
are resistant to antibody-dependent degradation(21). Additional disulfides may provide further
stability, although these will need to be tested in immunogenicity studies. Thus, secondary immune
responses to internal protomer epitopes may not be an issue provided more advanced designs are
utilized. Currently, all of the Env trimers that are most advanced in preclinical or clinical programs
(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03699241, NCT04177355, NCT03783130) do not have such stabilizing
disulfides and we predict that humans will therefore also produce base-directed trimer degrading
antibodies. Chemically cross-linked trimers, which we demonstrated are resistant to disassembly,
are also being tested in humans by the European AIDS Vaccine Initiative (eavi2020.org).
Attempts to mask the base of the trimer via attachment to nanoparticles or alum have only had
marginal impact on reducing base-directed antibodies(20, 21). Thus, further development of these
strategies will be required, likely to include inter-protomer disulfide bonds. There is also the
potential for prime boost immunization strategies using Env trimers of different sequences at the
base such that they cannot be recognized (and degraded) by the base-directed antibodies elicited
by the prior immunization. Because the base of the trimer is typically shielded by the membrane
it has a relatively high degree of sequence conservation, which makes this strategy less viable.
Hence, further mutating exposed base residues, or resurfacing, may be required for such an
approach to work. Display of Env trimers on liposomes or delivered via nucleic acid and expressed
on cell surfaces in vivo may also limit the base-directed responses.
In summary, our study reveals a previously unappreciated phenomenon of base-directed antibodyinduced in vivo Env subunit trimer degradation and secondary antibody responses. These
phenomena are unlikely to be unique to HIV Env. Given large number of efforts to employ subunit
vaccines against other pathogens including influenza, Respiratory Syncitial Virus (RSV)(35),
SARS-CoV-2, and others, it will also be important to assess antibody mediated disassembly in
those systems as well. EMPEM was integral to our ability to uncover this confounding factor,
further demonstrating the power of single particle EM approaches to comprehensively characterize
heterogenous ensembles of proteins and protein-protein complexes. Importantly, standard single
particle EM workflows usually eliminate, or overlook, data that does not contribute to stable 3D
reconstructions. Hence, we advise that future studies include comprehensive 2D and 3D
classification to reveal the full extent of species in a given ensemble of Env-antibody complexes.

24 female 12-week-old New Zealand white rabbits were prime (wk0: CRF250 SOSIP trimer) and
boosted (boost-1: wk8 (CRF250 SOSIP (group-K), or BG505-CRF250V1V2 chimeric SOSIP
(group-L) or its N130 (group-M) or V2’ (group-N) glycan filled SOSIP trimers) and boost-2: wk24
(ZM179-ZM233V1V2 chimeric SOSIP trimer) with 50ug of trimer protein and 375 µg of
ISCOMs-like saponin adjuvant in 600 uL PBS (300 uL IM injection into each hind leg) (Song et.
al. in preparation). Blood was drawn from the marginal ear vein into EDTA or untreated blood
collection tubes from select time points (wk2, wk8, wk10, wk26) and the polyclonal IgGs for
EMPEM were purified from immune sera/plasma. All procedures were performed in anesthetized
animals. 2 groups of 6 rhesus macaques (RMs) each, all females between the ages 5-7 years, were
immunized with chimpanzee SIV MT145KdV5 SOSIP (group-1) or MT145KdV5 SOSIP
conjugated with alum through pSer peptide linkers (Song et. al. in preparation), as described
previously(20). Animals were prime (wk0) boosted (wk8) intramuscularly by injecting 100ug of
MT145KdV5 or MT145KdV5-pSer trimer proteins along with 1mg alum and 375ug of SMNP
adjuvant per animal per immunization. EDTA blood at select time points was collected from
animals for isolating polyclonal IgGs for EMPEM analysis.
Monoclonal Fab Production
RM20C Fab was expressed in HEK293F cells and purified using affinity chromatography. Briefly,
HEK293F cells (Invitrogen) were co-transfected with heavy and light chain plasmids (1:1 ratio)
using PEImax. The transfection was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Supernatant was harvested 6 days following transfection and passed through a 0.45 µm filter prior
to purification using CaptureSelect™ CH1-XL (ThermoFisher) affinity chromatography.
Env Protein Production
To produce the BG505-CC2 construct, the following mutations were introduced into the BG505
SOSIPv5.2 construct(17) using the QuikChange Lightning Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit
(Agilent): P240T, S241N, M271I, F288L, T290E, P291S, R500A, L568D, V570D, R585H,
C605T, S613T, Q658T and L663C. Env trimers were expressed in 293F cells and purified using
PGT145 affinity chromatography as described previously(17).
Env controls and monoclonal complexes
Unliganded Env trimers were deposited directly onto nsEM grids as controls. Env trimers were
incubated overnight at room temperature with monoclonal Fabs in excess of 4.5 molar. Complexes
were diluted to 0.03mg/mL and deposited onto nsEM grids. EDC BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer was
purified and chemically crosslinked as described previously (29, 31).
EMPEM
The polyclonal IgGs from serum or plasma were purified by incubating with equal volume of
Protein A and G sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) at 4°C overnight, followed by washing with PBS
and elution of IgGs with 2M Citric Acid into 0.2M TrisBase. Eluents were buffer-exchanged into
PBS using 30kD Amicon tube protein concentrators (MilliporeSigma). The purified polyclonal
IgGs were then digested into Fabs using Pierce Fab Preparation Kit (Thermo Scientific). Briefly,
after preparation of the IgG sample using Zeba Spin Desalting Columns, 0.25ml equilibrated
Immobilized Papain were incubated with 1-2 mg of IgG in digestion buffer rotating for 4-5 hours
at 37°C. Digest was separated from Immobilized Papain by centrifugation, followed by mixing
incubation with Protein A resin at room temperature for 30min. The flow-through after

centrifugation containing Fab fragments were then buffer-exchanged into TBS using 10kD filter
Amicon tubes (MilliporeSigma). For EMPEM, 500ug of serum Fab was added to 15ug of Env
trimer and incubated overnight at 4C. The EMPEM complex was purified from excess Fab using
size exclusion chromatography. The complex peak was concentrated to about 0.03mg/mL and
deposited directly onto a nsEM grid.
Negative stain electron microscopy
Env complexes were added to carbon-covered 400 mesh copper grids. Grids were stained with 2%
UF. Micrographs were collected using Leginon(36) on either a TF20 or Spirit electron microscope.
They were equipped with either a TVIPs or EAGLE 4kx4k camera. Particles were picked using
DoGpicker and stacked using Appion(37). Particles were 2D classified by Relion (2 and 3) (38,
39). Particles resembling an Env trimer or Env protomer were selected for further processing.
Coloring of 2D class images was done in Photoshop. 3D maps were visualized in Chimera(40).

Figure 3. Antibody-dependent trimer degradation occurs over time. (A) Two weeks after
initial injection of antigen, the immune system develops base binding antibodies but Env stays
intact. (B) 6 weeks post prime and 2 weeks after a boost, the immune system develops new
glycan hole peptide region antibodies and base binding antibodies which cause trimer
degradation. (C) 26 weeks after initial injection, rabbit serum causes complete degradation of
trimer with Fabs bound to all sides of protomer. (D) Highlighted classes show intact Env trimer
(purple) with Fabs (seafoam green) and protomers (purple) decorated with Fabs. (E) Early
timepoints show immediate base response (seafoam green). As time goes on, other potentially
neutralizing antibodies appear (mustard yellow). At the same time, the base response causes
degradation of the Env trimer, resulting in off-target secondary responses (blue).

Figure 5. Trimer degradation causing Fab in complex with
BG505 variants. (A) nsEM 2D classes shows that BG505
SOSIP.v3 degrades into protomers when incubated overnight
with RM20C. (B) Adding a CC mutation prevents binding of
the RM20C Fab all together. (C) Chemically cross-linking
EDC BG505 SOSIP.664 keeps trimer intact when RM20C
binds. (D) nsEM derived map of RM20C in complex with
EDC BG505 SOSIP.664. Model of 1C2 (6P65, purple,
orange) docked in with 6PEH (seafoam green) docked in as
Fab.
