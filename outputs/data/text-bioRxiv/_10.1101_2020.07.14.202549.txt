The cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as an attractive drug repurposing target for
COVID-19. Here we combine genetics and chemical perturbation to demonstrate that
ACE2-mediated entry of SARS-CoV and CoV-2 requires the cell surface heparan sulfate
(HS) as an assisting cofactor: ablation of genes involved in HS biosynthesis or incubating
cells with a HS mimetic both inhibit Spike-mediated viral entry. We show that heparin/HS
binds to Spike directly, facilitates the attachment of viral particles to the cell surface to
promote cell entry. We screened approved drugs and identified two classes of inhibitors
that act via distinct mechanisms to target this entry pathway. Among the drugs
characterized, Mitoxantrone is a potent HS inhibitor, while Sunitinib and BNTX disrupt
the actin network to indirectly abrogate HS-assisted viral entry. We further show that
drugs of the two classes can be combined to generate a synergized activity against SARSCoV-2-induced cytopathic effect. Altogether, our study establishes HS as an attachment
factor that assists SARS coronavirus cell entry, and reveals drugs capable of targeting this
important step in the viral life cycle.

The ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has claimed many lives and
severely damaged the global economy. This severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused
by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2

1, 2

, which is closely related to SARS-CoV, the virus

underlying the 2003 SARS outbreak 3.
As a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus bearing a membrane envelope,
coronavirus enters cells when this membrane envelope fuses with host membranes 4. Viral entry
may take place either at the plasma membrane or at the endosomes following receptor-mediated
endocytosis 5. Previous studies showed that SARS-CoV enters cells primarily through ACE2dependent endocytosis 5-9. New evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may follow the same entry
path 1, 10, 11. Specifically, limiting the production of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)
inhibits the fusion of the SARS-CoV-2 envelop with the endolysosomes and viral entry

12, 13

.

Additionally, viral entry-associated membrane fusion requires a priming step mediated by
several host proteases including the lysosome-localized Cathepsin B/L and serine proteases of
the TMPRSS family

12, 14-18

. Although some TMPRSS proteases may act on the cell surface, the

fact that increasing the lysosomal pH in either TMPRSS2 positive Caco-2 or TMPRSS2 negative
HEK293 cells both inhibits SARS-CoV-2 cell entry

14

suggests endolysosomes as a major entry

site for SARS-CoV-2 at least in certain cell types.
Our previous study on the intercellular transmission of misfolded α-Synuclein (α-Syn)
fibrils, a cellular process reminiscent of viral infection, revealed an endocytosis mechanism by
which the cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) facilitates receptor-mediated uptake of protein
assemblies bearing excess positive charges

19

. HS is a negative charge-enriched linear

polysaccharide molecule that is attached to several membrane and extracellular proteins, which
are collectively termed as heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). The cell surface HS can serve

as an anchor point to facilitate endocytosis of many cargos

20, 21

, which include SARS-CoV-2

related coronaviruses 22-25. To identify drugs that can diminish the spreading of misfolded α-Syn
and the associated Parkinsonism 26, we screen and identify eight FDA-approved drugs that block
the HS-dependent endocytosis of preformed α-Syn fibrils (see below). Intriguingly, one of the
candidates Tilorone was recently reported as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection

27

. This

coincidence, together with the recently reported interaction of SARS-CoV-2 Spike with the HS
mimetic glycan heparin 28-30 and other evidence in support of a role for HS in the entry of SARSCoV-2-related coronaviruses 22-25, 31 prompted us to investigate the possibility of targeting HS as
a COVID-19 therapeutic strategy.

Results
Heparan sulfate facilitates Spike-dependent viral entry
To study Spike-mediated viral entry, we constructed luciferase-expressing pseudoviral particles
(PP) bearing SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 Spike. We infected HEK293T (human embryonic
kidney cells) cells or HEK293T cells stably expressing ACE2-GFP with PP. As expected,
ACE2-GFP HEK293T cells transduced with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 PP expressed
luciferase significantly higher than non-infected ACE2-GFP cells (Fig. S1A, B) or infected
HEK293T cells without ACE2-GFP (Fig. S1C). These results confirm Spike-dependent entry of
SARS-CoV and CoV-2 via ACE2.
To test the role of HS in viral entry, we first treated ACE2-GFP HEK293T cells with
heparin, a HS mimetic glycan frequently used as a competitive inhibitor for HS ligands (Figure
1A) 32, 33. Heparin treatment dose-dependently mitigated luciferase expression from both SARSCoV and CoV-2 PP (Figure 1B, C) with little impact on cell viability (Fig. S1D). Heparin

treatment also reduced luciferase expression in SARS-CoV- or CoV-2-transduced human lung
epithelial Calu-3 cells (Fig. S1E) and the level of inhibition was more significant than in ACE2GFP overexpressing cells. Heparin pulldown showed that the purified Spike ectodomain readily
bound to heparin-conjugated beads (Figure 1D). As expected, the interaction was sensitive to salt,
but a significant amount of Spike remained associated with heparin in a buffer containing
120mM NaCl (Fig. S1F), a condition recapitulating the airway surface salt concentration

34

.

These data suggest that heparin acts as a competitive inhibitor for Spike-mediated viral entry and
this inhibitory activity could be offset by overexpression of ACE2.
Next, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) or CRISPR to disrupt genes encoding
HSPG biosynthetic enzyme XYLT2 and SLC35B2

19

(Figure 2A, Fig. S1G-I). XYLT2 encodes

one of the two HS chain initiation enzymes. SLC35B2 is a Golgi-localized transporter for 3’phosphoadenosine 5’-phosphosulfate (PAPS), which is essential for HS chain sulfation

32

.

Knockdown of XLYT2 by ~80% inhibited SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 PP entry similarly as
heparin treatment (Figure 2B). By contrast, CRISPR-mediated inactivation of SLC35B2
completely abolished HSPG biosynthesis

19

and thus inhibited the entry of SARS-CoV and

SARS-CoV-2 more dramatically (Figure 2C). Analyses of GFP fluorescence showed no effect of
SCL35B2 knockout on ACE2-GFP expression (Fig. S1J). Nevertheless, the knockout of
SLC35B2 significantly reduced the binding of SARS-CoV-2 PP to ACE2-GFP cells (Figure 2D,
E). Altogether, these results support a model in which the cell surface HS serves as a virusrecruiting factor to promote ACE2-dependent viral entry.

A drug screen identifies inhibitors targeting the HS-dependent cell entry pathway

HS is a negatively charged biopolymer, which can recruit ligands bearing positive charges to
facilitate their endocytosis

20

. We recently characterized the endocytosis mechanism of α-Syn

fibril, which is a HS ligand 19. We then conducted a quantitative high-throughput (qHTS) screen
using α-Syn filamentous inclusions to search for approved drugs that could block HS-dependent
endocytosis (Figure 3A). The screen identified 8 drugs that inhibited α-Syn fibril uptake in
HEK293T cells (Figure 3B). Additional studies using a panel of endocytosis cargos confirmed
that the identified drugs are endocytosis inhibitors with a preference for HS-dependent ligands
(Figure 3C). Among the cargos tested, supercharged GFP (GFP+), polycation-coated DNA, and
VSVG-pseudotyped lentivirus all enter cells via a SLC35B2 dependent mechanism 19, 35, whereas
Transferrin uses a HS independent but clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathway. The cholera
toxin B chain (CTB) reaches the Golgi apparatus via a clathrin-independent mechanism 36. None
of the drugs tested affected the internalization of CTB, but Sunitinib and BNTX appeared to
disrupt the perinuclear stacking of the Golgi system (Fig. S2A, B). These drugs also had little
impact on Transferrin endocytosis (Fig. S2C), but they could reduce the uptake of HS-dependent
cargos to various levels with Mitoxantrone being the most potent one: at 5 μM, it almost
completely blocked the endocytosis of all HS-dependent cargos tested (Figure 3C, Fig. S2D-F).
Biochemical binding coupled to mass spectrometry analyses showed that these drugs
could be categorized into two classes depending on whether they bound to heparin. While
Exifone, K114, Tilorone, BNTX, and Sunitinib showed no affinity to heparin, Mitoxantrone,
Raloxifene, and Piceatannol in solution could be effectively depleted by heparin beads (Figure
3D), suggesting that these drugs amy target the cell surface HS directly to inhibit cargo uptake.
Among the drugs identified, Tilorone was previously established as a pan-antiviral agent
37

that also inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro

convergence of SARS-CoV and CoV-2 entry and α-Syn endocytosis at the HS glycans raise the
possibility that inhibitors of HS-dependent endocytosis might also block SARS-CoV and CoV-2
entry. Indeed, with the exception of Exifone and K114, other drugs could all mitigate Spikemediated viral entry in ACE2-GFP cells (Fig. S3A and see below). Exifone and K114 were
excluded from further study.

The actin network is required for Spike-mediated viral entry
We chose representative drugs of the two classes for further characterization. For those that did
not bind heparin, we characterized BNTX and Sunitinib because their effect on Golgi
morphology suggested a potential shared mechanism. BNTX is an opioid receptor antagonist for
opioid or alcohol use disorders, while Sunitinib has been used as a receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitor for cancer therapy 38. In HEK293 ACE2-GFP cells treated with SARS-CoV or SARSCoV-2 PP, these drugs inhibited viral entry with respective IC50 of ~30μM and 10μM for
Sunitinib, 9μM and 10μM for BNTX (Figure 4A, B). In Vero E6 cells treated with wild-type
SARS-CoV-2, BNTX at 2 μM rescued the virus-induced CPE by ~70%, whereas 10μM
Sunitinib rescued the CPE only by ~30% (Figure 4C, Fig. S3B).
Because HS-assisted endocytosis often requires the actin cytoskeleton 19, we determined
whether these drugs affect the actin cytoskeleton network using U2OS cells stably expressing
Tractin-EGFP, an actin filament label

39

. Confocal microscopy showed that actin monomers

polymerize near peripheral membranes in untreated cells, forming a microfilament network with
parallel actin filaments (Fig. S3C). Additionally, a meshwork of actin is associated with the cell
cortex, while thick actin bundles named stress fibers are often found near basal membranes. In
cells exposed to Sunitinib, the actin microfilaments were frequently replaced by short disoriented

actin segments. Many cells also contained an increased number of filopodia. By contrast, cells
treated with BNTX had significantly reduced number of actin filaments, with many cells
containing actin-positive aggregates (Fig. S3C, top panels). These phenotypes were further
confirmed by TIRF microscopy in Sunitinib- or BNT-treated cells but were not observed in cells
treated with other drugs (Fig. S3C, D).
To further elucidate the actions of Sunitinib and BNTX, we used live-cell imaging to
monitor the acute changes in actin dynamics in drug-treated cells. Shortly after Sunitinib
treatment, we observed extensive de novo actin filament formation (Figure 4D, E,
Supplementary movies 2 vs. 1). Actin polymerization was also detected in the cell periphery
where it drove filopodium formation (Figure 4D) but was not seen near basal membranes where
stress fibers were located (Supplementary movie 4 vs. 3). Unlike Sunitinib, BNTX treatment
resulted in rapid shrinking of actin microfilaments and the loss of membrane ruffling in the
peripheral cortex (Figure 4F, G, Supplementary movies 6 vs. 5). These data suggest that
Sunitinib promotes actin assembly to form disoriented filaments, whereas BNTX disrupts the
cortex actin meshwork either by promoting actin disassembly or inhibiting actin assembly. The
fact that two structurally unrelated actin inhibitors both block SARS-CoV and CoV-2 entry
strongly suggests that the entry of these viruses may require the actin cytoskeleton. Accordingly,
SARS-CoV-2 PP entry was also inhibited by Latrunculin A, a well-established actin inhibitor
(Figure 4H). These findings, together with the fact that Sunitinib was previously identified as an
entry inhibitor for Ebola virus 40 highlight an important role played by actin in the entry of these
RNA envelop viruses.

Mitoxantrone inhibits viral entry by targeting HS

Among drugs bound to heparin, Mitoxantrone had a higher affinity. Mitoxantrone was
previously reported as a DNA intercalator, which also inhibits type II DNA topoisomerase

41, 42

.

Accordingly, Mitoxantrone is currently approved for treatment of acute non-lymphocytic
leukemia, prostate cancer, and multiple sclerosis. In PP-treated ACE2-GFP HEK293 cells,
Mitoxantrone strongly inhibited viral entry with IC50 >100-fold lower than that of cytotoxicity,
suggesting an excellent anti-viral therapeutic window (Figure 5A).
Because Mitoxantrone has absorbance peaks at 620 nm and 685 nm (Fig. S4A). we used
this spectral property to trace its localization in drug-treated cells, which hinted at its cellular
target. To this end, we performed subcellular fractionation using Mitoxantrone-treated cells to
obtain the nucleus (1,000g pellet), mitochondria-enriched heavy membrane (7,000g pellet), light
membrane (100,000g pellet), and cytosol (100,000g supernatant) fractions (Figure 5B top panel).
Although blue color was seen in every pellet fraction, Mitoxantrone in the nucleus and heavy
membrane fractions was resistant to extraction by a buffer containing the non-ionic detergent
NP40 or 1% SDS, probably due to tight association with DNA. By contrast, Mitoxantrone in the
light membranes (containing the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum as demonstrated
by immunoblotting, middle panel) could be readily released by an NP40-containing buffer and
detected by a spectrometer (Figure 5B). No Mitoxantrone was detected in the cytosol fraction.
Thus, in addition to DNA, Mitoxantrone also binds to cell membranes.
Several lines of evidence suggest that Mitoxantrone targets the cell surface HS directly.
First, the amount of P100-associated Mitoxantrone from SLC35B2 deficient cells (lacking HS)
was significantly lower than that of wild-type cells, which could be rescued by re-expression of
SLC35B2 (Figure 5C). Additionally, as mentioned above, Mitoxantrone readily bound to heparin,
a glycan structurally related to HS (Figure 3F, Fig. S4B). Because the interaction of heparin with

Mitoxantrone lowered its absorption spectrum in solution (Fig. S4C), we used this property to
further determine the interaction of Mitoxantrone with other related glycans. As expected, HS
bound to Mitoxantrone similarly as heparin, but chondroitin sulfate (CS) did not bind to
Mitoxantrone significantly (Figure 5D). Moreover, Banoxantrone, an anti-cancer drug
structurally related to Mitoxantrone did not show significant interaction with either heparin or
HS (Figure 5E, Fig. S4D, E). These results suggest a specific and direct interaction between
Mitoxantrone and HS, which explains the SLC35B2-dependent association with the cell
membranes. Importantly, compared to Mitoxantrone, Banoxantrone was a much weaker SARSCoV-2 PP entry inhibitor (Figure 5F), suggesting a crucial role for heparin/HS binding in the
anti-viral activity of Mitoxantrone.
Although Mitoxantrone binds HS directly, it did not disrupt the binding of SARS-CoV-2
PP to ACE2-GFP-expressing cells. Instead, when cells pretreated with Mitoxantrone were
exposed to SARS-CoV-2 PP, most viral particles remained bound to the plasma membrane as
revealed by immunostaining with an anti-Spike antibody (Figure 5G). By contrast, in control
cells, Spike antibodies detected mostly intracellular speckles, probably representing endocytosed
viral particles (Figure 5G). This result suggests that Mitoxantrone and Spike bind HS in different
modes, but the binding of Mitoxantrone to HS alters its function to block viral entry.
Surprisingly, while weaker inhibitors like BNTX rescued the CPE of SARS-CoV-2 in
Vero E6 cells, Mitoxantrone did not show any activity in this assay. This might be due to
cytotoxicity linked to the DNA binding off-target property of Mitoxantrone. Consistent with this
notion, Vero E6 cells were more sensitive to Mitoxantrone-induced cell death (Fig. S4F vs.
Figure 5A). In this regard, it is compelling to see that the dose-dependent toxicity profiles of
Mitoxantrone and Banoxantrone were indistinguishable (Fig. S4F), which suggests the

possibility of generating Mitoxantrone derivatives with reduced cytotoxicity but similar antiviral
activity.

A combination regimen optimally targeting the HS-assisted viral entry
We next used gene expression profiling to further define the action of Tilorone, Raloxifene, and
Piceatannol in comparison to Mitoxantrone. We treated HEK293T cells with these drugs at a
dose that inhibited Spike-mediated viral entry. Differential gene expression analyses showed that
Mitoxantrone had the most significant impact on gene expression, probably due to its strong
DNA binding activity (Figure 6A). By contrast, Tilorone had the smallest effect, altering a
limited number of genes by only small changes (Fig. S5A-D). Cluster analysis showed that the
gene expression signature associated with Raloxifene treatment was more similar to that of
Piceatannol-treated cells than to Tilorone-treated cells (Figure 6A), consistent with the
observation that Raloxifene and Piceatannol but not Tilorone interact with heparin.
Conceptually, it might be possible to combine drugs targeting distinct steps in the HSassisted entry pathway to produce synergized anti-viral activity. We tested the combination of
Raloxifene with Tilorone because the latter has been used as an anti-viral agent and because
either Tilorone or Raloxifene by itself modestly rescued SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE in Vero E6
cells (Fig. S5E, F). Strikingly, co-treatment with 1.5 μM Raloxifene reduced IC50 of Tilorone by
~10-fold in the CPE assay (Figure 6B). The synergistic inhibition of viral CPE was further
confirmed by a matrix test, in which Tilorone was tested systematically with different
concentrations of Raloxifene (Figure 6C). Importantly, no significant cytotoxicity was observed
in combined treatment even at highest concentrations (Figure 6D).

Discussion
It is known that ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV and CoV-2 entry is controlled by a proteasedependent priming step

14-16

. Evidence presented in this study supports an additional layer of

regulation imposed by the cell surface HS. The cell surface HS proteoglycans comprise of two
protein families (6 Glypicans and 4 Syndecans)

32

. Proteins of these two families share no

sequence similarity, but they all bear negatively charged HS polymers that can promote cell
interactions with a variety of endocytic ligands

20, 21

. Our data together with recent preprints in

BioRxiv support a model in which HS glycans help to recruit SARS-CoV-2 to the cell surface,
which increases its local concentration for effectively engaging ACE2

43, 44

(Figure 6E).

Interestingly, some other coronaviruses also use a similar two-receptor mechanism for cell entry.
For example, some α-Coronaviruses first attach themselves to sialoglycans on the cell surface
before binding to proteinaceous receptors 45, 46.
How do HS glycans interact with Spike? Two recent studies posted at BioRxiv modeled
the interactions of heparin with Spike using either full length Spike or just the RBD domain 29, 44.
While several potential binding sites were suggested on full length Spike, a more sensible model
was generated when the RBD domain was used. This model suggests a long positive chargeenriched binding groove that accommodates a chain of heparin/HS. This model, if confirmed, is
consistent with the observed salt sensitive heparin-Spike interaction.
How Mitoxantrone inhibits SARS-CoV and CoV-2 entry remains to be elucidated. It is
known that Spike in the prefusion state adopts distinct conformations with the RBD domain
either in the up or down position 44, 47, and the interaction of Spike with ACE2 requires the RBDup conformation

11, 48-50

. By contrast, the proposed HS binding model is compatible with either

the RBD-up or down conformation 44. Thus, it is possible that HS binding occurs on Spike with

12

flexible RBD positions, and this conformational plasticity may facilitate downstream steps such
as ACE2-dependent endocytosis and/or protease-mediated priming

51

. Mitoxantrone might

influence the way HS interacts with the Spike and thus inhibits viral entry.
In addition to Mitoxantrone, we uncover several other drugs capable of targeting HS and
HS-dependent endocytosis. The fact that many of these drugs also mitigate Spike-dependent
viral entry strongly corroborates the idea that ACE2-mediated endocytosis serves a major role in
SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. The identified drugs have a relatively limited impact on endocytosis as
they affect neither clathrin-mediated transferrin uptake nor clathrin-independent uptake of CTB.
Thus, these drugs are expected to be less toxic than previously reported pan-endocytosis
inhibitors 13. Among the drug identified, Sunitinib and BNTX disrupt actin dynamics (Figure 7E),
suggesting the actin network as a previously unknown regulator for SARS-CoV and CoV-2 entry.
These viruses may enter cells using receptor-mediated macropinocytosis, which depends on actin
and has been known for its role in in viral pathogen uptake 52.
Although our study focuses on SARS-CoV and CoV-2, drugs targeting HS and HSdependent endocytosis are expected to have a broad antiviral activity. Consistent with this view,
Tilorone has long been recognized as a general antiviral agent. An early study in mice suggested
that Tilorone administrated orally might upregulate interferon production

53

, but our gene

expression study did not reveal significant changes in the expression of interferon by Tirolone
treatment. Instead, the demonstration of Tilorone as an inhibitor of HS-dependent endocytosis
offers an alternative explanation for the reported antiviral function. Importantly, our study also
suggests that Raloxifene, a heparin/HS-binding drug can enhance the anti-viral activity of
Tilorone. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used to treat osteoporosis and to
prevent breast cancer in postmenopausal women (drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00481) 54. Both Tilorone

and Raloxifene are well tolerated and can be conveniently administrated orally. Thus, whether
this combination can be clinically effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection deserves additional
testing in animal and other anti-viral models. In summary, our study not only establishes HSdependent viral entry as a novel drug target for COVID-19, but also reveals candidate drugs that
disrupt this critical event in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.

Methods
Chemicals and reagents
The initial screening library LOPACR1280 was purchased from Sigma. The chemicals for the
follow-up studies were purchased as indicated in the table below. Standard quality control by
HPLC was conducted before the drugs were used in the study. pcDNA3.1-SARS-CoV2-Spike
plasmid was obtained from BEI resource 11. Other chemicals and reagents were listed in the table

.

siRNA-mediated gene silencing was performed by lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen)
mediated transfection following the instruction from the manufacture. HEK293T cells were
seeded in white 1,536-well microplates that have transparent bottom (Greiner BioOne) at 2,000
cells/well in 2 µL media and incubated at 37 °C overnight (~16 h). pHrodo red-labeled α-Syn
fibrils were added at 400 nM final concentration to each well by a dispenser. After 1 h incubation,
compounds from the LOPACR1280 library (Sigma) were titrated 1:3 in DMSO and dispensed via
pintool at 23 nl/well to the assay plates. After 24 hours of incubation, the fluorescence intensity
of pHrodo red was measured by a CLARIOstar Plus plate reader (BMG Labtech). Data were
normalized using cells containing 400 nM pHrodo red-labeled Syn fibrils as 100% and medium
containing 400 nM preformed fibrils-pHrodo red as 0%.

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particles (PP)
SARS-CoV-S, SARS-CoV2-S, and ΔEnv (lack the Spike protein) pseudotyped particles (PP)

PP entry assay in the 1536-well format
HEK293-ACE2 cells seeded in white, solid bottom 1536-well microplates (Greiner BioOne) at
2,000 cells/well in 2 µL medium were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 overnight (~16 h).
Compounds were titrated 1:3 in DMSO and dispensed via pintool at 23 nl/well to the assay plates.
Cells were incubated with compounds for 1 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 before 2 µl/well of PP were
added. The plates were then spinoculated by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm (453 x g) for 45 min
and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C 5% CO2 to allow cell entry of PP and the expression of
luciferase. After the incubation, the supernatant was removed with gentle centrifugation using a
Blue Washer (BlueCat Bio). Then 4 µL/well of Bright-Glo luciferase detection reagent (Promega)
was added to assay plates and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The luminescence signal
was measured using a PHERAStar plate reader (BMG Labtech). Data were normalized with
wells containing PP as 100% and wells containing control ΔEnv PP as 0%. Experiments shown
in Figure 4A-C, Fig. S3A, Figure 5A were conducted in this format at NCATS.

luminescence signal was measured by a Victor 1420 plate reader (PerkinElmer). For ACE2-GFP
cells, the GFP signal was also determined by the plate reader. Data were normalized with wells
containing PP but no compound as 100%, and wells mock-treated with phosphate buffer saline
(PBS) as 0%, and the ratio of luciferase to the corresponding GFP intensity was calculated.
Experiments shown in Figure 1B, D, Figure 2B, C, Figure 5F were done following this protocol
at NIDDK.

ATP content cytotoxicity assay in the 1536-well format
HEK293-ACE2 cells were seeded in white, solid bottom 1,536-well microplates (Greiner
BioOne) at 2,000 cells/well in 2 µl medium and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 overnight (~16
h). Compounds were titrated 1:3 in DMSO and dispensed via pintool at 23 nl/well to assay plates.
Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C 5% CO2 before 2 µl/well of media was added. The plates
were then incubated at 37 °C for 48 h at 37C 5% CO2. After incubation, 4 µl/well of ATPLite
(PerkinElmer) was added to assay plates and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The
luminescence signal was measured using a Viewlux plate reader (PerkinElmer). Data were
normalized with wells containing cells as 100%, and wells containing media only as 0%.

(PerkinElmer) was added to assay plates and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The
luminescence signal was measured using a Victor plate reader (PerkinElmer). Data were
normalized with wells containing cells but no compound as 100%, and wells containing media
only as 0 %.

SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect (CPE) assay
SARS-CoV-2 CPE assay was conducted at the Southern Research Institute (Birmingham, AL) as
fee-for-service. Briefly, compounds were titrated in DMSO and acoustically dispensed into 384well assay plates at 60 nl/well. Cell culture medium (MEM, 1% Pen/Strep/GlutaMax, 1%
HEPES, 2% HI FBS) was dispensed at 5 µl/well into assay plates and incubated at room
temperature. Vero E6 (selected for high ACE2 expression) was inoculated with SARS CoV-2
(USA_WA1/2020) at 0.002 M.O.I. in media and quickly dispensed into assay plates at 4,000
cells/well in 25 µl volume. Assay plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 90%
humidity. Then, 30 µl/well of CellTiter-Glo (Promega) was dispensed, incubated for 10 min at
room temperature, and the luminescence signal was read on an EnVision plate reader
(PerkinElmer). An ATP content cytotoxicity assay was conducted with the same protocol as CPE
assay except that SARS-CoV-2 virus was omitted from the incubation.

GFP+ purification and HSPG staining
His-tagged GFP+ was reported previously

19

. To stain the cell surface HSPG by GFP+, we

incubated cells with 200 nM GPF+ in the growth medium on ice for 15min. Cells were then
fixed and stained with DAPI to reveal the nucleus.

Endocytosis and viral binding assays
To test the effect of the compounds on DNA uptake, we seeded HEK293T cells previously
infected with a YFP-expressing retrovirus at 0.2 x 106/well in a poly-lysine D coated 12 well
plate. 24 h later, cells were treated with the chemicals for 30 min before a transfection mixture
containing 0.2 µg mCherry-expressing plasmid and 0.6 µl TransIT293 (Mirus) was added
to the cells. Cells were incubated with the DNA for 4 h, after which the medium was replenished.
The cells were further grown for 48 h. Cells were then lysed in NP40 lysis buffer and the
fluorescence intensity in cleared lysates was measured by a Fluoromax3 fluorometer (Horiba).
To test the effect of compounds on VSVG-coated lentivirus uptake/infection, HEK293T
cells expressing YFP were seeded at 0.2x106/well in a poly-lysine D coated 12 well plate. After
24 h, cells were treated with compounds for 30 min and then infected with a mCherry-expressing
lentivirus at M.O.I. of ~ 2.0 in the presence of the compounds for 6 h. The virus and compounds
were removed, and cells were further grown in fresh medium for 48 h before fluorescence
measurement.
To test the effect of compounds on GFP+ or transferrin uptake, HEK293T cells were
seeded at 25,000 cells per well in an 8 well chamber (ibidi). 24 h later, cells were treated with
compounds for 30 min before the addition of GFP+ (200 nM) or transferrin (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) (50 μg/ml). Cells were further incubated at 37 °C for 4 h before fixation and confocal
imaging.
To detect the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the cell surface, HEK293T-ACE2-GFP cells
seeded in 24 well plates that had been coated with fibronectin were treated with 50 μl virus per
well at 4 °C for 1 h with centrifugation at 1500 rpm (453 x g) for 60 min. Cells were carefully

washed with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound virus and then lysed in a NP40 lysis buffer
containing 0.5 % Igepal, 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM Sodium Chloride, 2 mM Magnesium
Chloride, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and a protease inhibitor cocktail. The cell extracts cleared
by centrifugation (16,000 x g 5 min) were analyzed by immunoblotting.

UPLC-MS/MS assay
Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) methods
were developed and optimized to determine compounds’ concentrations in the in vitro samples.
Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a Waters Xevo TQ-S triple quadrupole
instrument using electrospray ionization in positive mode (Mitoxantrone, BNTX, Tilorone and
Sunitinib) and negative mode (Raloxifene, Piceatannol, Exifone, K114) with the selected
reaction monitoring. The separation of test compounds was performed on an Acquity BEH C18
column (50 x 2.1 mm, 1.7 µ) using a Waters Acquity UPLC system with 0.6 mL/min flow rate
and 2 minute gradient elution. The mobile phases were 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1%
formic acid in acetonitrile. The calibration standards (0.100 – 100 µM) and quality control
samples were prepared in 50% acetonitrile/water with 0.1% formic acid and PBS buffer.
Aliquots of 10 µL samples were mixed with 200 µL internal standard in acetonitrile to
precipitate proteins in a 96-well plate. 0.5 µL supernatant was injected for the UPLC-MS/MS
analysis. Data were analyzed using MassLynx V4.1 (Waters Corp., Milford, MA).

qRT-PCR analysis of knockout or knockdown cells
Total RNA was extracted from 3 million HEK293T cells using TriPure reagent (Roche) and
purified using RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Promega) following the standard protocols. The

RNA concentration was measured by Nanodrop 2000 UV spectrophotometer, and 1µg total RNA
was converted to cDNA using the iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix (BioRad) system. 1µL
cDNA was used to perform qPCR using SsoAdvanced SYBR Green supermix kit (BioRad) on a
CFX96 machine (BioRad). Data were analyzed using BioRad CFX Manager 3.0 software.
GADPH was used as a reference gene for the quantification of gene expression levels. Primers
used for qRT-PCR were listed in the previous study 19. For the RNAseq study, cells were treated
independently for 6 h with each drug three times and 6 untreated control samples were included.
The treatment conditions are Mitoxantrone 5 µM, Tilorone 10 µM, Raloxifene 10 µM,
Piceatannol 10 µM. RNA isolated from control or drug-treated cells (10 µg/sample) were
processed by Novagene USA.

Membrane fractionation and heparin Sepharose pulldown
To fractionate cells, ~15 million cells were treated with 5 µM Mitoxantrone or Banoxantrone for
30 min at 37 °C. Cells were harvested and washed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then
resuspended and incubated in 900 µl of a hypotonic buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 25 mM
potassium acetate) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail. Cells were homogenized in a Dounce
homogenizer with a tight pestle and then subject to differential centrifugation at 1,000 g for 5
min, 7,000 x g for 10min, and 100,000 x g for 20 min. The P100 membrane pellet was
resuspended in 20 µl NP40 lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 0.5% NP40, 150 mM
Sodium Chloride, 2 mM Magnesium Chloride. The absorbance in the cleared membrane extract
and the S100 fraction was measured by a NanoDrop 2000 spectrometer. Note that no absorbance
was detected for the S100 fraction even when the samples were measured by a conventional
spectrometer with a 10 x light path.

To determine the binding of Mitoxantrone to heparin-coated Sepharose, the compound
was diluted to 50 µM in PBS and then incubated with PBS-washed heparin beads or as a control
with Sepharose.

After brief mixing, the beads were sedimented by centrifugation. The

supernatant fractions were analyzed by NanoDrop 2000 for light absorption at the wavelengths
specified in the figure legends.
The pulldown of Spike by heparin beads were done by incubating 600ng Spike with prewashed heparin Sepharose in 25mM Tris pH 7.3, 2mM KCl, 1mM MgCl2, 0.05% Igepal with or
without 150mM NaCl. To test the effect of Mitoxantrone on heparin-Spike interaction, 30 µl
heparin beads were washed with PBS, treated with 200 µl Mitoxantrone (100 µM) for 5 min at
room temperature or as a control remained untreated. Unbound Mitoxantrone was removed after
centrifugation. The beads were then incubated with 600 ng purified Spike protein in 300 µl PBS
containing 0.05% NP40 and 1mM DTT. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30
min. The beads were washed two times with PBS and eluted with 1 x Laemmli buffer for SDSPAGE and immunoblotting analysis.

Drug synergy analysis
CPE and Toxicity were normalized using independent control wells (DMSO ± virus) on each
plate, so activity values were not strictly bounded between [0, 100]. For CPE assay,
DMSO+virus was treated as the neutral control, whereas DMSO-only (no virus) served as the
positive control. Then normalized CPE = 1 - (x - neutralCtrl) / (positiveCtrl - neutralCtrl) ×
100%. For viability assay, DMSO-only was used as the neutral control and media-only wells (no
cell) as the negative control. Normalized viability = (x - negativeCtrl) / (neutralCtrl -

negativeCtrl) × 100%. Synergism and antagonism from a 6 × 6 block were evaluated using the
highest single agent model (HSA). Given a dose combination Aconc1 + Bconc2,
HSA(Aconc1+Bconc2) = activity(Aconc1+Bconc2) – MIN[activity(Aconc1), activity(Bconc2)]
Therefore, we have
Synergism: HSA(*) < 0 (value from combination is lower than the best single agent)
Antagonism: HSA(*) > 0 (value from combination is greater than the best single agent)
Additivity: HSA(*) = 0 (value from combination equals to best single agent)

The overall HSA synergism (HSAsum) given a 6 × 6 block was calculated as the sum of
HSA(Aconc*+Bconc*) across the non-toxic dose combinations (defined as viability activity > 80).
We used empirical cutoff HSAsum < -100 to call a synergistic combination. The highest
concentration of Raloxifene was excluded from the figure because it alone induced significant
cytotoxicity.

Image processing and statistical analyses
Confocal images were processed using the Zeiss Zen software. To measure fluorescence
intensity, we used the Fiji software. Images were converted to individual channels and region of
interest was drawn for measurement. Statistical analyses were performed using either Excel or
GraphPad Prism 8. Data are presented as mean ± SEM, which was calculated by GraphPad
Prism 8. p-values were calculated by Student’s t-test using Excel. None linear curve fitting and
IC50 calculation was done with GraphPad Prism 8 using the inhibitor response 3 variable model
or the exponential decay model. Images were prepared with Adobe Photoshop and assembled in
Adobe Illustrator. All experiments presented were repeated at least twice independently except

Figure 5 Gene expression analyses of Tilorone- and Mitoxantrone-treated cells.
(A) A heat map summary of the most induced or down-regulated genes by Tilorone treatment (T,
10 μM 6 h) or in untreated (U) HEK293T cells.
(B) A heat map summary of the most induced or down-regulated genes by Mitoxantrone
treatment (M, 5 μM 6 h) or in untreated (U) HEK293T cells.
(C) A volcano plot shows the genes affected by Tilorone. Note that both the number of genes
(shown by the number) and the scale of the expression changes in Tilorone-treated cells are
small.
(D) A volcano plot shows the genes affected by Mitoxantrone.
(E, F) The CPE inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity of Tilorone and Raloxifene. Vero E6 cells
were treated with Tilorone (E) or Raloxifene (F) in the presence (CPE) or absence of wild-type
SARS-CoV-2. Cell viability was measured 72 h after treatment.

The cell shown in movie 1 was imaged after treatment with Sunitinib 5 μM for 15 min. Note the
increased assembly of actin filaments causes new filopodia formation on the cell surface.
Movie 3
A Tractin-EGFP-expressing U2OS cell was imaged after treatment with Sunitinib 5 μM for 60
min.
Movie 4
The same Tractin-EGFP-expressing U2OS cell in movie 3 was imaged at a different confocal
plan where the stress fibers are located.
Movie 5
A U2OS cell expressing Tractin-EGFP.
Movie 6
The cell shown in movie 5 was imaged after treatment with BNTX 10 μM for 5min.
