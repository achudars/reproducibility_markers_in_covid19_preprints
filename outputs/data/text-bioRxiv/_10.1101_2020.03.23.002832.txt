Summary
The recent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 was first
reported in China (December 2019) and now prevalent in ~170 countries across the
globe. Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into mammalian cells require the binding of viral Spike
(S) proteins to the ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) receptor. Once entered
the S protein is primed by a specialised serine protease, TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane

Serine Protease 2) in the host cell. Importantly, beside respiratory symptoms,
consistent with other common respiratory virus infection when patients become
viraemic, a significant number of COVID-19 patients also develop liver comorbidities.
We explored if specific target cell-type in the mammalian liver, could be implicated in
disease pathophysiology other than the general deleterious response to cytokine
storms. Here we employed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to survey the human
liver and identified potentially implicated liver cell-type for viral ingress. We report the
co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a TROP2+ liver progenitor population.
Importantly, we fail to detect the expression of ACE2 in hepatocyte or any other liver
(immune and stromal) cell types. These results indicated that in COVID-19 associated
liver dysfunction and cell death, viral infection of TROP2+ progenitors in liver may
significantly impaired liver regeneration and could lead to pathology.

Introduction
Since December of 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has impacted millions of lives
worldwide. As of 23rd March 2020, more than 340,000 people are reported to be
infected, with ~4-5% mortalities (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). The SARSCoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family of
zoonotic viruses that infect mammals and birds (Andersen et al., 2020). The novel
SARS-CoV-2 was first isolated from lung airway epithelial cells of patient with
pneumonia (Chen et al., 2020). Since then it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2
employ receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into human cells
and utilise Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for Spike (S) Protein
priming (Hoffmann et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 shares ~80% sequence similarity with
SARS-CoV and ~50% with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV), all of which cause severe respiratory symptoms (Hoffmann et al., 2020).
Moreover, in addition to respiratory disease, SARS and MERS are known to cause
liver impairments (Alsaad et al., 2017; Chau et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2020).
Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was discovered in stool sample of the first US patient,
indicating gastrointestinal tract infection (Holshue et al., 2020). A recent study reported
14-53% cases with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) in the liver of COVID-19 patients (Huang et al., 2020; Zhang
et al., 2020). Moreover, these symptoms were elevated in intensive care unit (ICU)
patients compared to patients who did not require ICU (Huang et al., 2020). It remains
to be investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 directly infect liver cells. In addition, concerns
have been raised on effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pre-existing liver condition (Gu
et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Since SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2
and require TMPRSS2 for activation, we surveyed the human liver (from tumor and
adjacent normal regions of hepatocellular carcinoma patients) by sc-RNA-seq to
identify which cell type co-express these two genes.
Here we report that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are co-expressed in only one sub-population
in human liver. Based on expression of cell type specific markers ALB (Albumin), KRT
(Keratin), EPCAM and unique expression pattern of TROP2 (TACSTD2) and SOX9
(SRY-box 9), we annotated this population as liver progenitors. Our results suggest

SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 is only expressed on TROP2high cholangiocytebiased progenitors while serine protease TMPRSS2 is expressed by TROP2high and
TROP2int population. These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection might
preferentially infect the TROP2high cholangiocyte-biased progenitor pool, thereby
compromising the regenerative abilities of infected liver and/or contributing to liver
pathology.
Results
Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human liver scRNA-seq atlas
We performed scRNA-seq on human liver tissue obtained from tumor and adjacent
normal tissue of hepatocellular carcinoma patients (Sharma et al., in revision). In total,
we analysed ~74,000 cells and employed Louvain algorithm for clustering of these
cells. We identified 29 clusters based on the expression of cell type specific genes.
These clusters were further annotated into hepatocyte, epithelial progenitors,
lymphoid and myeloid cells (Figure 1A) and observed specific enrichment of EPCAM+
and SOX9+ epithelial progenitor cluster in normal liver (Figure 1B). We identified the
specific markers for every cluster (Figure 1C) and observed the co-expression of
KRT18 and KRT19 in epithelial progenitor cluster. Next, we investigated which cell
types in the human liver co-express SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 and the
priming enzyme TMPRSS2. Our analysis revealed the specific expression of ACE2
and TMPRSS2 in the epithelial progenitor cluster (Figure 1D and 1E). This suggests
that EPCAM+ liver progenitors express machinery for both SARS-CoV-2 entry (ACE2)
as well as priming (TMPRSS2) and might be susceptible for viral infection leading to
liver dysfunction.
TROP2+ liver epithelial progenitors express ACE2 and TMPRSS2
A recent scRNA-seq study has suggested the heterogeneity in EPCAM+ liver epithelial
progenitors (Aizarani et al., 2019). Therefore, we further sub-clustered the epithelial
cells (hepatocytes and progenitors) to understand the nature of ACE2 expressing liver
progenitors (Figure 2A). Sub-clustering also showed the predominant presence of
normal liver cells in the progenitor cluster (Figure 2B). Further we detected the
presence of these cells in adjacent normal region from multiple individuals (Figure 2C).
Interestingly, lower abundance of these cells in human liver is in concordance with the

rare stem-like or progenitor population in epithelial tissues. Next, we analysed the
expression of hepatocyte, cholangiocyte and bi-potent markers in these clusters. The
progenitor cluster specifically expressed EPCAM (progenitor marker) as well as
KRT19 and CFTR (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) which are
known to be expressed in progenitors with a cholangiocyte fate bias (Figure 2D) (Cohn
et al., 1993). Importantly, we failed to detect expression of hepatocyte fate bias genes,
ASGR1 (Asialoglycoprotein receptor 1) and ALB in this cluster. Since this progenitor
cluster demonstrated bias for cholangiocyte fate we further investigated the
expression of TROP2 gene. The TROP2 expression is known to mark the fate of liver
epithelial progenitors where lower TROP2 expression is linked with hepatocyte fate
and TROP2high cells with cholangiocyte fate (Aizarani et al., 2019).
Recently, Aizarani et al., demonstrated the progenitor-like properties of TROP2+ cells
where TROP2Int cells demonstrated highest organoid forming efficiency followed by
TROP2high cells, while TROP2low cells failed to generate organoids (Aizarani et al.,
2019). Therefore, we investigated whether any of the epithelial clusters co-expressed
ACE2, TMPRSS2, and TROP2. Notably, we observed that only the EPCAM+
progenitor cluster expressed all three genes (Figure 2E). Next we sub-divided this
cluster into TROP2 low, intermediate and high cells and investigated the expression
of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and other cell fate markers. Remarkably, we observed that
TROP2high cells expressed the highest levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, followed by
TROP2Int and TROP2low cells (Figure 2F). Our analysis revealed that TROP2Int (bipotent) cells also express MUC6 and SOX9, whereas TROP2high (cholangiocyte fate
bias) cells express makers such as CFTR, CXCL8, HES1 and KRT19. Taken together,
our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect TROP2high cells via ACE2 and
TMPRSS2, thereby contributing to liver dysfunction by compromising the ability of the
human liver to regenerate cholangiocytes.
Additionally given the recent discussion on possible intrauterine vertical transmission
of SARS-CoV-2, we also analysed human fetal liver scRNA-seq atlas at 16 and 21
week EGA. Our analysis indicated very low to negligible level of ACE2 and an absence
of TMPRSS2 expression in EPCAM+ fetal liver cells (Figure 3A-D). Our limited
analysis suggest that fetal liver may not express the machinery required for SARSCoV-2 infection.

Discussion
In recent reports of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in human population, the presence of viral
mRNA in infected patient’s stool suggests a potential GI (gastrointestinal) tract
infection in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 can reach the liver either through the
general circulation once patient has become viraemic or through transmigration
through the GI tract. We surveyed human liver scRNA-seq data to understand the
expression pattern of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene which are essential for SARS-CoV2 entry into human cells. Our analysis reveals that in human liver only EPCAM+
progenitors co-express genes for viral entry (ACE2) and S-protein priming
(TMPRSS2). Further analyses revealed the specific expression of ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 in TROP2high cells. These results indicate that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are
specifically present in liver progenitors with a cholangiocyte fate bias, suggesting
SARS-CoV-2 may be affecting cholangiocyte precursors, thereby potentially impeding
the homeostasis of the cholangiocyte pool. Recent studies have reported the
expression of ACE2 in cholangiocytes, however, did not reflect over the heterogeneity
of ACE2+ population (Chai et al., 2020). In this study we explored the heterogeneity of
ACE2+ cells and systematically characterised ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression as
hallmarks of TROP2+ epithelial progenitors.
Our study reveals the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to infect TROP2+ progenitor like cells
in human liver. It is important to note that TROP2 is expressed in multiple epithelial
progenitors (Crowell et al., 2019; Okabe et al., 2009; Vallone et al., 2016). In the future
it will be important to survey other GI tract tissues at single-cell level for the expression
of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and their associated transcriptomes. Given the GI tract
infection and multi-organ failure in COVID-19, it is important to understand whether
other progenitor-like cells are also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover,
TROP2 expression has been associated with amplifying progenitor cells in partial
hepatectomy mouse model (Okabe et al., 2009) indicating the important role of
TROP2+ cells in liver regeneration. Taken together, our analysis suggests that adult
human liver TROP2+ progenitors could be a prime target of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3E).
General hepatocyte cell damage from cytokine storms in ill patients with viraemia from
respiratory viral infection is not uncommon. Such hepatocyte damage are usually

transient and the resulting liver regeneration usually restores liver function efficiently.
In the case of COVID-19, however the predilection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus for
cholangiocyte precursor cells may significantly impair liver regeneration. Clinicians
looking after patients with COVID-19 should be alerted to the possibility of progressive
liver deterioration in patients with serious SARS-Cov-2 viraemia. This study
demonstrates the power of single-cell RNA-seq to understand the pathobiology of
COVID-19 and pave the way for similar studies to understand the effect of SARS-CoV2 on different tissue and cell types.

Experimental Methods
Tissue acquisition
The fresh tissue samples were obtained from Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and
National University (NUH) with written consent and approval from central institution
review board of singhealth (CIRB2012/669/B) for study on liver cancer. The samples
were delivered in with MACS Tissue Storage Solution (Miltenyi, Cat#:130-100-008).
Human fetal liver samples
The donation of fetal liver tissues for research was approved by the Centralised
Institutional Research Board of the Singapore Health Services in Singapore followed
by proper international ethical guidelines and in accordance with a favorable ethical
opinion from Singapore SingHealth and National Health Care Group Research Ethics
Committees. Women gave written informed consent for the donation of fetal tissue to
research nurses who were not directly involved in the research, or in the clinical
treatments of women participating in the study, as per the Polkinghorne guidelines.

trimester (16 and 21 weeks EGA) elective pregnancy terminations carried out for
socio-psychological reasons. All fetuses were considered structurally normal on
ultrasound examination prior to termination and by gross morphological examination
following termination. In total 2 fetuses of 16 and 21 weeks EGA were used for this
study.
Tissue processing
Tissues were transferred immediately using the following procedure. Tissue was
transferred to a sterile 10mm2 tissue culture dish and cut into very small fragments.
The dissociation buffer consisted of 0.43mg/ml of Collagenase IV (Thermofisher, Cat#:
17104019) and 0.172mg/ul of DNAse1 (Worthington, Cat#: LS002147) dissolved in
PBS (Thermofisher, Cat#: 20012-043). The tissue was digested in dissociation buffer
for 30-40 minutes depending on sample size at 37oC with constant shaking at 220rpm
while keeping the falcon tube in a slanted position. The solution was re-suspended

with 10ml pipette followed by 18g needle. The 1% BSA PBS solution was added to
the digested tissue and then the solution was passed through a 70um filter before
centrifuging at 800g for 6 minutes at 4oC. Cells were treated with 5ml of 1x RBC lysis
buffer (Biolegend, Cat#: 420301) on ice for 10-15 minutes. 1% BSA PBS solution was
then added and the cells were passed through 40um filter. Cells were dissolved in 1%
BSA PBS solution prior to counting.
Data processing using Cell Ranger software
Sequenced fastq files are aligned, filtered, barcoded and UMI counted using Cell
Ranger Chromium Single Cell RNA-seq version 2.0.2, by 10X Genomics with Cell
Ranger, GRCh38 database (version 1.2.0) as the human genome reference. All 62
sectors are aggregated using cellranger aggr by normalizing all runs to the same
sequencing depth.
Clustering and downstream analysis
Downstream analysis was done using Scanpy, a scalable Python-based package
(version 1.4) designed for single cell gene expression datasets. Scanpy implements
numerous functions from preprocessing to visualization, clustering, differential gene
expression, and trajectory inference analysis on Jupyter Notebooks. Parameters used
in each function are manually curated to portray the best clustering of cells. In
preprocessing, cells are filtered based on the criteria of expressing a minimum of 200
genes and a gene which is expressed by a minimum of 30 cells. Dying cells with a
mitochondrial percentage of more than 5% are excluded. Cell count was normalized
using scanpy.api.pp.normalize_per_cell with a scaling factor of 10,000 whereas gene

the number of PCs used in each clustering exercise varies depending on the

UMAP topology (scanpy.api.tl.umap, minimum distance between 0.3 to 0.5) which is
consistently used throughout this paper. Louvain method (scanpy.api.tl.louvain) is
then used to detect a community of similar cells. By default, Louvain’s resolution
parameter is set to the maximum value of 1.0, this in theory finds more and smaller

clusters. In our experiments, the value is set between 0.6 to 1. Genes are then ranked
using scanpy.api.tl.rank_genes_groups (Benjamini Hochberg, t-test overestimated
variance with adjusted p-value). Cell types was manually and iteratively assigned
based on overlaps of literature curated and statistically ranked genes. To leverage the
heterogeneity of this dataset, we used partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA,
scanpy.api.tl.paga) to reconstruct lineage between cell types. This lineage trajectory
provides a continuous cell type transition from the assigned discrete cell types. The
thickness of the edges represents connectivity scores, an entropy-based measure
provided by PAGA indicating relatedness between clusters; spurious connections are
discarded while tuning thresholds.
