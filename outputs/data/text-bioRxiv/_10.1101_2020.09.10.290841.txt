Abstract

13

The ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has brought tremendous crisis on global health

14

care systems and industrial operations that dramatically affect the economic and social life

15

of numerous individuals worldwide. Understanding anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses

16

in population with different genetic backgrounds and tracking the viral evolution are

17

crucial for successful vaccine design. In this study, we reported the generation of CD8 T

18

cell epitopes by a total of 80 alleles of three major class I HLAs using NetMHC 4.0

19

algorithm for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, a key antigen that is targeted by both B

20

cells and T cells. We found diverse capacities of S protein specific epitope presentation by

21

different HLA alleles with very limited number of predicted epitopes for HLA-B*2705,

22

HLA-B*4402 and HLA-B*4403 and as high as 132 epitopes for HLA-A*6601. Our

23

analysis of 1000 S protein sequences from field isolates collected globally over the past

24

few months identified three recurrent point mutations including L5F, D614G and G1124V.

25

Differential effects of these mutations on CD8 T cell epitope generation by corresponding

26

HLA alleles were observed. Finally, our multiple alignment analysis indicated the absence

27

of seasonal CoV induced cross-reactive CD8 T cells to drive these mutations. Our findings

28

provided molecular explanations for the observation that individuals with certain HLA

29

alleles such as B*44 are more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studying anti-S protein

30

specific CD8 T cell immunity in diverse genetic background is critical for better control

31

and prevention of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Introduction

34

The coronavirus (CoV) is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus that can cause

35

respiratory and enteric diseases in wide range of hosts including human, numerous animals,

36

birds and fish(1). Four genera (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta) of CoVs have been

37

classified with human CoVs designated within Alpha and Beta groups. Their genome,

38

about 30kb in length, is the largest found in RNA viruses and encodes more than 20

39

putative proteins, including four major structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E),

40

membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N)(1). The human seasonal CoVs are endemic

41

throughout the world, causing 15-30% respiratory tract infections that are typically mild

42

and self-limiting. However, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in

43

2003(2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012(3) that were caused by the

44

infection of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV had led to about a mortality rate of about 10%

45

and 40%, respectively(1,4).

46
47

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by 2019 novel

48

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and later renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome

49

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China from

50

patients with severe pneumonia(5–7). Subsequently, this novel viral infection has rapidly

51

spread into nearly all countries over the world, leading to the declaration of the first-known

52

coronavirus global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11,

53

2020(8). As of July 31, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 17 million confirmed

54

cases and more than 680,000 deaths globally according to the update from Johns Hopkins

55

Coronavirus Resource Center (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). Like SARS-CoV

56

and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 was identified as betacoronavirus through genome

57

sequencing and bioinformatic analysis(6,7) and has been formally classified by the

58

International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ITVC)(9).

59
60

The S protein of SARS-CoV contains neutralization epitopes, which are critical for

61

eliciting anti-viral B cell immune responses. Therefore, S protein appears to be a promising

62

antigen target for vaccine development(4,10). Similarly, a growing body of research has

63

identified neutralization epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 S protein(11–13). Although SARS-

64

CoV neutralization antibody is critical, the neutralizing antibody titers and memory B cell

65

response were short-lived in SARS-recovered patients(14). Similarly, the antibodies

66

including the neutralization antibody induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection could fade

67

quickly(15,16). In addition to the anti-S protein humoral response, S protein specific CD8

68

T cells have been shown with protective immunity during SAR-CoV infection and are

69

critical for vaccine efficacy(17,18). Therefore, identifying SARS-CoV-2 S protein specific

70

CD8 T cell epitopes and fully utilizing CD8 T cell immunity in addition to neutralization

71

response are urgently needed for studying anti-COVID-19 immunity and developing

72

effective vaccines. Since its initial outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 has undergone genetic

73

mutations(19). Further, mutations on S proteins that may affect human ACE2 receptor

74

binding, viral transmission and infectivity have been reported(20–22). However, the

75

potential effects of these mutations on CD8 T cell epitope generation have not been

76

analyzed.

78

In this study, we used the NetMHC 4.0 prediction algorithm to analyze a panel of classical

79

human MHC I (HLA-A, B and C) restricted CD8 epitopes on the S protein of SARS-CoV-

80

2. Our data showed a significant variation of CD8 T cell epitope repertoires for different

81

HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C alleles. In addition, our analysis using a large number of S

82

protein sequences derived from SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed important mutations

83

including L5F, D614G and G1124V that are although less likely driven by seasonal CoV

84

derived cross-reactive CD8 T cells, may differentially impact CD8 T cell epitope

85

generation by different HLA alleles. Our results indicate genetic variability of three major

86

class I HLAs may regulate S protein specific CD8 T cell responses, leading to differential

87

susceptibility to and severity of the infection of SARS-CoV-2 that keeps mutating.

S protein specific CD8 T cell epitopes of different HLA alleles

91

The NetMHC 4.0 algorithm has been widely utilized for predicting CD8 T cell epitopes of

92

human and animals. By using this tool, our analysis for the S protein of reference Wuhan-

93

Hu-1 virus generated a total of 5044 CD8 T cell epitope pool for three major class I HLAs

94

with a total of 80 different alleles (Supplementary Table 2). Among these, there are 2282

95

epitopes for HLA-A, 1816 for HLA-B and 946 for HLA-C (Table 1). Within HLA-A,

96

A*6601 allele showed 132 epitopes, the highest among all, indicating a potential broad and

97

strong CD8 T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 from individuals bearing this particular

98

allele. However, there were several HLA-A alleles (*0201, A*0205, A*0207, A*0301,

99

A*3101, A*3301) that only had about 30 epitopes. Other HLA-A alleles showed epitopes

100

ranging from 40 to around 100 (Table 1). Similarly, within HLA-B, the total number of

5

101

epitopes for individual alleles differed substantially, ranging from 16 to 118. The lowest

102

number of epitopes among all the alleles analyzed was generated by HLA-B*2705.

103

Additionally, HLA-B*4402 and HLA-B*4403 also had very low numbers of CD8 T cell

104

epitopes (17 and 19 each) (Table 1). This observation may explain why B*44 positive

105

individuals are more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection(23). Furthermore, the total number

106

of epitopes the HLA-C alleles could present varied from 75 to 121. These results indicate

107

the capacity to present SARS-CoV-2 S protein specific CD8 T cell epitopes among

108

different HLA alleles could be of great difference.

109
110

Mutations on S protein of SARS-CoV-2

111

SARS-CoV-2 has evolved since its initial outbreak by changing its viral genome, which

112

may cause mutations in viral proteins including S protein, resulting in the establishment of

113

better fitness(19,24). We analyzed 1000 full length or near-full length S protein sequences

114

(Supplementary Table 1) through multiple alignment and comparison with the reference S

115

protein sequence to identify potential recurrent mutations and assess the effect on CD8 T

116

cell epitope generation for different HLAs. The result in Fig 1 showed the location map of

117

massive mutations across entire S protein that were observed from the 1000 S protein

118

sequences. It appears that the hot spot targeted for mutation is located on the S1 subunit

119

composed of the signal peptide region (Position 1-13), N terminal domain, NTD (Position

120

16-317), receptor binding domain, RBD (Position 330-521) and the subsequent SD1 and

121

SD2 domains (Position 522-680) that is ahead of the S1/S2 cleavage motif PRRAR(25).

122

Although there are plenty of positions where the mutation can occur, the frequency of these

123

mutations is usually 0.1-0.2%, except three amino acids at position 5, 614 and 1124 that

6

124

showed a frequency of 1.6%, 63% and 1.3%, respectively (Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig

125

1). These mutation rates are all beyond the preferred 0.5% mutation threshold that is used

126

in influenza research(26) and the 0.3% tracking threshold for SARS-CoV-2

127

surveillance(27). In addition, these mutations are exclusively L to F at position 5, D to G

128

at position 614 and G to V at position 1124. A single mutation on CD8 T cell epitope that

129

is recognized and bound by HLA is one of the tactics several viruses, such as HIV, HCV

130

and Influenza can use to escape host immunity(28–30). Therefore, we further analyzed the

131

potential impact of these individual mutations on CD8 T cell epitope generation by

132

different HLA alleles.

133
134

Effect of L5F mutation on CD8 T cell epitope generation

135

The amino acid L on position 5 is part of the S protein signal peptide(25). Signal peptides

136

are important targets of CD8 T cell responses against viral and tumor antigens(31,32).

137

From the list of CD8 T cell epitopes for the 80 class I HLA alleles (Supplementary Table

138

2), we identified a total of 47 epitopes containing the L5 amino acid with the same sequence

139

of FVFLVLLPL that could be presented by 22 of 36 HLA-As, 16 of 34 HLA-Bs and 9 of

140

10 HLA-Cs we analyzed (Table 2). Other potential epitopes containing the L5 are very

141

limited and thus not evaluated. To examine whether a single mutation of L to F at position

142

5 on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein would affect FVFLVLLPL epitope presentation by

143

different HLA alleles, we replaced the L with F at position 5 on the reference S protein

144

sequence and re-analyzed the 9-mer CD8 epitopes for all the 80 HLA-A, B and C alleles

145

using NetMHC 4.0 as described. The resulting epitopes of each allele were compared to

146

the corresponding epitopes derived from the original reference S protein (Supplementary

147

Table 2). The comparison data in Table 2 showed that L5F mutation increased the epitope

148

binding affinity for 37 different HLA alleles, meanwhile only 10 other alleles had

149

decreased binding affinity for the mutated epitope FVFFVLLPL. In addition, the mutated

150

epitopes could be presented by 5 more HLA alleles (Table 2).

151
152

Effect of G1124V mutation on CD8 T cell epitope generation

153

The amino acid G on position 1124 is within the connector domain of the S protein(25)

154

that is important for S protein trimerization and critical for stabilizing S protein

155

conformational structure during pre-and post-fusion with host cell membrane(33). By

156

inspecting the epitopes in Supplementary Table 2, we found a total of 19 of the exact same

157

epitopes starting at position 1121 (FVSGNCDVV) that could be presented by 12 HLA-As

158

(HLA-A*0201, HLA-A*0202, HLA-A*0203, HLA-A*0206, HLA-A*0207, HLA-

159

A*0211, HLA-A*0212, HLA-A*0216, HLA-A*0219, HLA-A*0250, HLA-A*6802 and

160

HLA-A*6901) and 7 HLA-Cs (HLA-C*0303, HLA-C*0501, HLA-C*0602, HLA-C*0701,

161

HLA-C*0802, HLA-C*1203 and HLA-C*1502). Only one additional epitope starting at a

162

different position that contains the G1124 was identified for just one individual allele,

163

indicating FVSGNCDVV is the predominantly presentable epitope in the connector

164

domain of the S protein. Re-analyzing the epitopes of the 80 HLA alleles with the mutated

165

reference S protein containing the V1124 identified 13 HLA alleles with decreased binding

166

affinity for the mutated epitope FVSVNCDVV (Table 3). We also observed 6 other HLA

167

alleles lost the ability to present the mutant epitope. No alleles showed increased binding

168

affinity due to this mutation. Further there were no other alleles capable of presenting this

169

mutated epitope (Table 3).

170
171

Effect of D614G mutation on CD8 T cell epitope generation

172

The mutation at position 614 with a sole D to G switch at a 63% frequency is especially

173

alarming. The result revealed that SARS-Cov-2 isolates with G614 mutation has been

174

adapted and spread efficiently within human population. To our knowledge, the D614

175

amino acid is not within the essential receptor binding domain or a residue of any validated

176

neutralization epitopes for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, whether it is involved in CD8 T cell

177

response is not known. Through screening the epitopes listed in Supplementary Table 2,

178

we found that a panel of 22 HLA alleles including HLA-A*0101, HLA-A*0201, HLA-

179

A*0206, HLA-A*0207, HLA-A*0211, HLA-A*0212, HLA-A*0216, HLA-A*0219,

180

HLA-A*0250, HLA-A*2603, HLA-A*6601, HLA-A*6802, HLA-A*6901, HLA-B*1509,

181

HLA-B*2720, HLA-B*3901, HLA-B*4801, HLA-C*0501, HLA-C*0602, HLA-C*0802,

182

HLA-C*1203 and HLA-C*1402 had at least one CD8 T cell epitope containing the D614

183

amino acid (Table 4). Unlike the L5 and G1124 containing epitopes, D614 containing

184

epitopes could start at several different positions including 606, 607, 610, 611, 612 and 614

185

with the epitope of YQDVNCTEV most frequently observed (Table 4).

186
187

Similarly, we reanalyzed the 9-mer CD8 T cell epitope for the reference S protein with a

188

single D614G mutation. The resulting epitopes of each allele were compared to the

189

corresponding epitopes derived from original reference S protein (Supplementary Table 2).

190

The comparison data was summarized in Table 5. With a single D to G switch, there were

191

seven HLA alleles including HLA-A*0203, HLA-A*0205, HLA-A*0206, HLA-A*2403,

192

HLA-A*2501, HLA-A*2601 and HLA-C*1203 that obtained at least one CD8 epitope

193

containing the replaced amino acid G614. Interestingly, nine HLA alleles including HLA-

194

A*0101, HLA-A*0207, HLA-A*6802, HLA-A*6901, HLA-B*1509, HLA-B*3901,

195

HLA-C*0501, HLA-C*0802 and HLA-C*1203 lost one CD8 epitopes each that were

196

predicted using unmodified reference S protein sequence (Table 5). In addition to the direct

197

gain or loss of CD8 T cell epitopes, several HLA alleles had their epitope binding affinities

198

changed. These include the G614 containing epitopes with increased affinity for HLA-

199

A*0211, HLA-A*0212, HLA-A*0216, HLA-A*0219, HLA-A*0250, HLA-A*6601,

200

HLA-A*6802, HLA-A*6901, HLA-B*2720 and HLA-C*1402 (Table 5). Finally, we also

201

observed there were other G614 containing epitopes with decreased affinity for alleles

202

including HLA-A*0201, HLA-A*0206, HLA-A*0211, HLA-A*0212, HLA-A*0216,

203

HLA-B*4801, HLA-C*0602 (Table 5). These results illustrated differential effects of

204

D614G mutation on the capability to present S protein specific CD8 T cell epitopes by

205

different HLA alleles.

206
207

Lack of seasonal CoVs cross-reactive CD8 T cell immunity to promote L5F, D614G

208

and G1124V mutations

209

Currently, the detailed mechanisms driving these mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein

210

are not known. One possibility is that existing cross-reactive CD8 T cell immunity elicited

211

by human seasonal CoVs could promote the virus to mutate and escape immune

212

recognition in general population that are frequently targeted by seasonal CoVs. To test

213

this, we went ahead to evaluate if there are shared CD8 T cell epitopes containing L5, D614

214

and G1124 from four representative seasonal CoVs(1,4). However, our pairwise alignment

215

of the reference S protein with each of the four seasonal CoVs showed very low percent of

216

identities (27% for HCoV-NL63, 31% for HCoV-HKU1, 28% for HCoV-229E and 33%

217

for HCoV-OC-43). Further, multiple alignment of theses S protein sequences failed to

218

identify any identical or similar CD8 T cell epitope motif to these we described above that

219

include: FVFLVLLPL, FVSVNCDVV and several epitopes containing D614 (Table 4 and

220

Fig 2). From these results, it was concluded that there were unlikely any cross-reactive

221

CD8 T cells induced by seasonal CoVs that could promote the key mutations we observed.

222
223

Discussion

224

CD8 T cell response specific for S protein of SARS-CoV has been well characterized, yet

225

most of the data has primarily focused on HLA-A*0201(18,34–37). The epitopes of CD8

226

T cells and their specific responses against SARS-CoV in population with other HLA

227

alleles are scarcely investigated. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, reduction of CD8 T cells

228

is associated with worse prognosis and systemic inflammation(38). Yet, the specificities of

229

these CD8 T cell and associated HLA genetic background were not provided.

230
231

In this study, we intended to provide a broad representation of S protein specific CD8 T

232

cell epitopes of 80 different human HLAs for better understanding anti-SARS-CoV2 T cell

233

immunity. Our results indicated a potential differential anti-S protein CD8 T cell response

234

during COVID-19 infection in individuals with unique HLA alleles as the capacity of these

235

alleles to present potential epitopes varies dramatically (Table 1). Among them, HLA-

236

B*2705 is only capable of presenting 16 epitopes. This allele is highly associated with

237

various forms of arthritis(39). It’s known that SARS-CoV-2 infection in aged population

238

and people with underlying health conditions including immune disorders tend to be much

239

severe and lethal(40). Additionally, during acute influenza infection and chronic HIV

240

progression, viral escape mutations could occur on HLA-B*2705 restricted CD8 T cell

241

epitopes(41,42). Although we didn’t find evidence that seasonal CoV-2 could induce cross-

242

reactive CD8 T cells toward the three key mutations we identified, other mechanism may

243

promote SARS-CoV-2 to mutate and escape HLA-B*2705 restricted CD8 T cell immunity.

244

Population with Caucasian origins in several countries including Spain, Belgium, Austria,

245

Netherlands and USA have from about 6% to 14% high frequency for this allele according

246

to the allele frequency database (http://www.allelefrequencies.net/). Some of these

247

countries have been experienced substantially high COVID-19 case numbers and/or

248

mortalities. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, disease severity and immune responses

249

in HLA-B*2705 individuals warrant thorough investigations.

250
251

In addition to HLA-B*2705, B44 alleles also had very low number of epitopes (17 for

252

B4402 and 19 for B4403, Table 1). A recent epidemiologic study reported that HLA-B*44

253

and HLA-C*01 positive individuals were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infections in

254

Italy when compared with HLA-A*25, B*08, B*15:01, B*51, B*14, B*18, B*49, and

255

C*03(23). Although we weren’t able to predict the epitopes for C*01 allele as it hasn’t

256

been enlisted in NetMHC 4.0, each of A*25, B*08, B*15:01, B*51, B*14, B*18 and B*49

257

alleles we analyzed showed higher numbers of CD8 T cell epitopes than B*44 (Table 1),

258

indicating potential broad anti-S protein CD8 T cell responses may provide better

259

protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

261

Our data lacks experimental support, however, some of the S protein specific CD8 T cell

262

epitopes presented in this study have been validated in SARS-CoV infection and utilized

263

for monitoring human anti-SARS specific CD8 T cell responses using immunological

264

techniques such as ELISPOT and tetramer staining(18,34–37). One of these epitopes is

265

FIAGLIAIV that was identified in HLA-A*0201 patient infected with SARS-CoV(34).

266

This epitope was predicted not only for HLA-A*0201 on SARS-CoV2 S protein, but also

267

a total of other 21 alleles analyzed in this report including HLA-A*0202, HLA-A*0203,

268

HLA-A*0205, HLA-A*0206, HLA-A*0207, HLA-A*0211, HLA-A*0212, HLA-A*0216,

269

HLA-A*0217, HLA-A*0219, HLA-A*0250, HLA-A*2501, HLA-A*2601, HLA-A*2602,

HLA-A*6802, HLA-A*6901, HLA-B*3901, HLA-B*4601, HLA-C*1203, HLA-C*0802,

271

and HLA-C*1502 (Supplementary Table 2). The identified epitope RLNEVAKNL on

272

SARS-CoV(37) was shared with 8 HLA-A, 4 HLA-B and 3 HLA-C alleles for SARS-

273

CoV-2 in our study. Another SARS-CoV S protein specific CD8 T cell epitope,

274

VLNDILSRL(36) were predicted on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein for 9 HLA-A alleles, 1

275

HLA-B and 3 HLA-C alleles. The epitope NLNESLIDL we identified for 10 HLA-A

276

alleles was also characterized as a valid HLA-A*0201 restricted SARS-CoV CD8 T cell

277

epitope in a published study(35).

278
279

Although recent studies agreed that D614G mutation could enhance SARS-CoV-2

280

infectivity and promote its transmission(27,43), regarding its effect on virulence, one study

281

reported that G614 virus infection was associated with higher mortality(44), while the other

282

study concluded no obvious effect on disease severity(27). One potential explanation for

283

these disparate clinical findings is that the prevalent HLAs of the infected subjects in the

284

two studies differ, which leads to divergent anti-S protein CD8 T cell responses, either

285

toward the epitopes containing the G614 mutation alone and/or in combination with other

286

epitopes we identified, as D614G mutation can occur simultaneously with other mutations

287

on the S protein (Supplementary Fig 1 and data not shown). This is because first, our

288

prediction result showed only about 25% of the total HLA alleles we analyzed could mount

289

CD8 T cell responses targeting the epitopes containing D614 (Table 4). Secondly, among

290

these HLA alleles that could generate D614 containing CD8 T cell epitopes, the epitopes

291

they recognize and present to TCR differ (Table 5), which may lead to different TCR

292

clonotypes and anti-viral efficacy(45,46). Third, our mutational analysis on a panel of CD8

293

T cell epitopes that have G614 also suggested possible different control outcomes by

294

different HLA alleles as their bindings to the mutated epitope could be altered differently

295

(Table 5). We believe pairing HLA typing with SARS-CoV-2 sequencing and testing anti-

296

S protein CD8 T cell responses could allow precise assessment of clinical outcome of

297

D614/G614 virus infection on individuals with different HLA alleles.

298
299

Our data of mutational effect of L5F suggests that the evolution of SARS-CoV2 virus

300

targeting L5 might be eventually unsuccessful as the mutated epitope could enhance CD8

301

T cell recognition and killing through the enhanced interaction with most of the HLA

302

alleles (Table 2). In contrast, the G1124V mutation appears to favor the virus to escape

303

immune recognition as this mutation reduces epitope binding affinity of HLA alleles to a

304

level that some are no longer able to bind (Table 3). However, the V1124 variant has not

305

become as dominant as the G614. This could be due to other viral and host factors, such as

306

viral structure stability, peptide-MHC stability and innate responses that prevent this

307

variant to stand out further. Since the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in several major

308

countries hasn’t yet been controlled, the continual monitoring of these mutations on S

309

protein are still necessary.

310
311

Based on the data and discussions provided here, we would like to encourage the research

312

labs to carry out further validation and characterization of these candidate S protein

313

epitopes and study their role in protecting SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine immunity.

314

These epitopes should include not only the ones that had been identified for the S protein

315

of SARS-CoV, but also uncharacterized epitopes such as these containing L/F5, D/G614

316

and G/V1124. We also recommend the clinical labs to organize and utilize resources to

317

combine SARS-CoV-2 sampling and viral genome sequencing with HLA typing and S

318

protein specific CD8 T cell immune testing to gather more useful data for better identifying

319

risk groups and implementing policies that are suited for different geographical locations,

320

resulting in more effective transmission control. Ultimately, we believe these efforts will

321

provide more solid data for effective vaccine development and elimination of SARS-CoV-

322

2 from human population.

CD8 T cell epitope prediction

332

CD8 T cell epitope prediction was performed on NetMHC4.0 Web Server

333

http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHC/

334

(ANNs)(47). A total of 36 HLA-A, 34 HLA-B and 10 HLA-C alleles (Table 1) was used

335

for prediction. 9-mer peptides (epitopes) with rank score ≤2.0% were selected as positive

336

HLA-binder. As the output format for the epitopes derived from NetMHC4.0 begins with

337

0, one was added to the resulting positions of all epitopes presented in this study to match

338

Mutational analysis

341

To identify mutations on SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we selected a total of 1000 complete or

342

near-complete S protein sequences of from viruses isolated from countries in North

343

America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, Africa and South America. These sequences were

344

deposited in the NCBI database with collection dates ranging from January to June 2020

345

and showed at least 95% of query coverage for the reference S protein (accession number

346

QHD43416.1). The list of the accession numbers for these sequences was provided in

347

Supplementary table 1. Multiple alignment of these 1000 protein sequences against the

Fig 2. Multiple alignment of reference S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with four seasonal human
CoVs (NL63, HKU1, 229E and OC43). The alignment was performed using Mega-X as
described. The predicted CD8 T cell epitopes were highlighted in yellow and the
corresponding mutational targets of L5, D614 and F1124 were bolded and underlined on
the SARS-CoV-2. The accession number for S proteins of SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-NL63,
HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are QHD43416.1, APF29063.1,
