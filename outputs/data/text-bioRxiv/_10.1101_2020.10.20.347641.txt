Abstract
The evolution of circulating viruses is shaped by their need to evade antibody response, which
mainly targets the glycoprotein (spike). However, not all antigenic sites are targeted equally by
antibodies, leading to complex immunodominance patterns. We used 3D computational models to
estimate antibody pressure on the seasonal influenza H1N1 and SARS spikes. Analyzing
publically available sequences, we show that antibody pressure, through the geometrical
organization of spikes on the viral surface, shaped their mutability. Studying the mutability
patterns of SARS-CoV-2 and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic spikes, we find that they are not
predominantly shaped by antibody pressure. However, for SARS-CoV-2, we find that over time,
it acquired mutations at antibody-accessible positions, which could indicate possible escape as
define by our model. We offer a geometry-based approach to predict and rank the probability of
surface resides of SARS-CoV-2 spike to acquire antibody escaping mutations.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, is one of the most
challenging global health crisis within the last century (1). The virus emerged as a result of a
zoonotic shift (2, 3). It is a member of the betacoronaviruses family (4), related to coronaviruses
found in Bats (5), and to SARS CoV that cause severe respiratory syndrome (6) as well as other
widely circulating members of the family that cause the common cold (7).
Coronaviruses (CoVs) have the largest genomes among RNA viruses (8). Nonstructural
protein 14 (nsp14), a subunit of the replicase polyprotein encoded by CoVs is thought to provide
a form of proofreading activity that could support the expansion of large CoVs genomes to their
current size. One result of such proofreading activity is that CoVs genomes are less mutable

compared to other RNA viruses (9), and thus the sequence diversity of SARS-CoV-2 is quite low
(10).
In response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many approaches for antibody (Ab) therapies,
and vaccines are being explored (11). Almost all vaccination approaches aim to use the
glycoproteins or spike protein (S) of the virus in its trimeric form (12) or vaccinate with the full
(inactivated) virus (13). The spike, a class I fusion protein, mediates entry to the host cell by
binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (Ou et al., 2020) and is the main
target of Ab response (Robbiani et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). These therapeutic approaches,
hopefully, would be able to elicit strong Ab and T cell response against the virus. In particular,
Abs against the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) have been shown to have neutralization and
protective capabilities (14, 15).
Since SARS-CoV-2 virus introduction into humans is recent, it probably has not yet
evolved extensively to acquire escape mutations from the commutative Ab pressure of the human
population (16). One mutation at the spike (D614G) is now widespread and is thought to support
a high viral growth rate (17). However, other members of the coronavirus family have been
circulating in human populations for many years (18) and evidence of antigenic drift is seen in
SARS-CoV-1 (Guan et al., 2003; Song et al., 2005), and among common cold coronaviruses 229E
(Chibo and Birch, 2006). Hence, given the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, to inform vaccine design
and understand how the fitness landscape of the virus evolves, it is important to recognize antigenic
drift due to Ab pressure if it were to occur. More generally, antigenic drift due to Ab pressure is
common in other RNA viruses such as the seasonal influenza virus (19, 20).
Here we sought to understand and predict, from first principle, to what extent the mutability
of the spikes of influenza and close relatives of SARS-CoV-2 could be attributed to Ab pressure.

The magnitude (titers) of Ab response against a given epitope is a direct consequence of the B
immunodominance hierarchy patterns of an immunogen, which are the result of various aspects of
the humoral response to antigen (21-23). Amongst them is the B cell repertoire – the number of B
cell clones targeting different epitopes (24-29), their germline affinity (24, 30), and T cell help to
B cell (31). Here, we concentrate on the geometric presentation of the spike to Abs. We have
previously shown using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, that the geometry of the
immunogen spike presentation on the virus recapitulates the known immunodominance of
hemagglutinin (HA) head compared to its stem (24).
We developed here an in-silico approach to estimate the Ab targeting - a proxy for B cell
immunogenicity (24), of residues on the spike surface, and the differential accessibility to antigenic
epitopes due to the geometrical presentation of spikes on the surface of the virus. Superimposed
on the spike surface, the immunogenicity score gives the Ab affinity maps of influenza and corona
spikes, which we applied to predict how the antigenic space is explored unevenly across the surface
of these glycoproteins. We then used sequences from public repositories (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,
www.gisaid.org) to evaluate the mutability maps of those glycoproteins. Next, we developed a
computational approach based on spectral clustering to compare these maps. We found that about
50% of the mutability maps variability of the S protein of the severe acute respiratory syndromerelated betacoronavirus (sarbecovirus), and 67% of the variability in the mutability of the seasonal
influenza spike (HA) can be attributed Ab pressure, as estimated from the model. This suggests
average, polyclonal Ab pressure was consequential in the diversification of the coronavirus
sarbecovirus spike and the seasonal flu spike. Moreover, our data suggest that the geometry of
spike presentation on the viral surface is a major factor determining its mutability.

We further studied the time evolution of SARS-CoV-2 spike mutability up to November
1st, 2020. While the overall correlation between our model and the mutability map is still low
(correlation coefficient 0.46), we find that it has been gradually increasing over time. While very
preliminary, it could suggest that some variants with Ab escape mutations are establishing in the
population. Overall, our approach allows us to recognize from first principle, based on the 3D
structure of glycoprotein and cryo-EM images of the viral surface, whether their mutational
landscape has features suggesting Ab evasion, and rank surface residues according to their
likelihood to acquire Ab-escaping mutations in the future. Importantly, this approach can detect
early signs of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza adaptation to evade immune pressure by memory B
cells.
Results
Geometry-dependent affinity of Abs to HA epitopes
The high-density presentation of spikes on the viral surface shelters, through steric impediments,
immunologically recessive and conserved residues from Ab targeting – for example, residues
belonging to the stem of HA (20, 29, 32). To study the relative accessibility of residues on the
spike surface, we employed MD simulations to define how Ab on-rate, and hence affinity, could
be modulated by the presentation of the spike. We first studied two geometrically distinct HApresenting immunogens: 1) Presentation as soluble full-length HA trimer in its closed form
[A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (NC99)] (25, 33-35) (Figure 1A-i); 2) HA presentation within H1N1
influenza A (NC99) virus model (Figure 1B-i) [See Material and Methods]. For each presentation
form, based on structural considerations, we computed the on-rate for Abs engaging different
surface epitopes (Figure 1A-ii, B-ii). The events occurred in the following sequence: 1] a single
Ab arm first engages a target epitope; 2] the Ab molecule continues to fluctuate, allowing the

second arm to target a second epitope, when the immunogen geometry is favorable, to bind it with
a high rate, resulting in bivalent binding (S Figure 2A-B).
We superimposed the in-silico estimated affinity (on-rate of the first Ab arm) on HA
structure to represent its affinity map (Figure 1A-i, B-i). In the context of the free HA trimer
presentation, we found that residues at convex sections on the spike surface were more accessible
to the Ab, resulting in high affinity (Figure 1A-ii). In the context of virus HA presentation (Figure
1B-ii), similar behavior followed, and the density of spikes on the viral surface reduced the ability
of the Ab to penetrate and interact with epitopes on the lower part of the spike, resulting in an
affinity gradient of the Abs targeting residue along the main axis (Figure 1B-ii right). Hence,
presentation on the virus surface, as occurs in vivo, leads to an immunodominance or Ab pressure
(targeting) gradient along the main axis of HA.
Antibody pressure directs the evolution of the seasonal flu
Viral infection elicits a humoral response and the production of Abs that target residues on
the surface of glycoproteins. For circulating viruses to propagate in a population, they have to
evade neutralization and recognition by Abs (36, 37). To do so, they accumulate mutations on their
glycoproteins

(38, 39). Because sterically hidden residues are less accessible to Abs, we

hypothesized their need to mutate is smaller compared to more accessible ones. Hence, we
expected spike evolution and the mutational landscape to follow Ab pressure.
The influenza virus mutates from one year and the next, where most of the mutations are
concentrated in five antigenic sites (Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2, Cb) located at the head of HA (40). Along
with genetic drift, escape from neutralization by Abs is one of the main factors contributing to HA
mutability (19, 20). To examine the relationship between Ab pressure as defined by our model,
and HA surface mutability, we studied the evolution of the seasonal influenza virus H1N1 using

sequences dating back to 1918 (see Material and Methods). Following alignment, we computed
the entropy of each surface residue identified as an epitope (see Material and Methods). The
entropy H j of residue j is given by

i∈ Amino acid in 
 virus family 

p j ,i log ( p j ,i ) ,

(1)

where p j ,i is the probability of amino acid i to appear at residue j across the viral population
(Figure 1C-i). By superimposing the residue entropy on the surface of HA, we created its
mutability map (Figure 1C-ii). Interestingly, the mutability map is comparable to the affinity map
computed for the virus presentation (Figure 1B-ii), showing a pattern of diminishing mutability
gradient along the main axis of the spike, but less so to the results for the trimer presentation
(Figure 1A-ii). This is corroborated by previous studies showing that the HA head acquires more
mutation and evolves faster than its lower part – the stem (41).
We next quantified the similarity of the affinity and mutability maps. Because of the
coarse-grained nature of our antibody model, we decided to aggregate close-by residues on the
spike surface (Figure 2A). As the surface features of the spike appeared to be an important factor
in determining Ab affinity, we applied a non-linear mapping (manifold learning) algorithm diffusion maps (42) on the epitopes' positions and used the first three components (Figure 2B). We
then applied the k-means clustering algorithm (43) (spectral clustering) to aggregate residues in
this space into epitope clusters (Figure 2C). We computed for each epitope cluster k its entropy
and affinity as follows:

where CEnt ,k and C Aff ,k are the epitope cluster entropy and affinity respectively, N k is the number
of residues in cluster k , ω j is the affinity (on-rate of the first Ab arm to epitope) to residue j , and
the entropy H j of residue j is given by eq.(1).
To assess the predictive strength of the computed affinity in explaining the observed
mutability, we computed the correlation between C Aff ,k and CEnt ,k as a function of the cluster
number (Figure 2D). We find that the correlation values for HA virus presentation are high, with
a maximum of 0.92 for 10 clusters, suggesting the in-silico model can explain a significant fraction
of the mutability. Interestingly, the correlation value, regardless of cluster number, is always larger
for the virus presentation than for the trimer (Figure 2D), highlighting that spike evolution and
escape due to Ab pressure occurs in the context of the virus - as a result, both mutability and Ab
affinity vary most along the main axis of the spike.
To determine the optimal number of clusters k for comparison between the two maps, we
first estimated the Total Within Sum of Squares for different cluster numbers (S Figure 5A) and
used the elbow method to choose k = 60 (44). For k = 60 , we found a correlation of 0.82 between
CEnt , k and C Aff ,k , suggesting that epitope cluster affinity, at this resolution, can explain 67% of

the variability in the mutability map of HA.
Surprisingly, most epitope clusters that contain residues belonging to the five antigenic
sites show a linear relation between their entropy and affinity, suggesting that the mutability of
these sites simply follows from their position on HA, the geometry of its presentation on the viral

surface, and is due to Ab pressure (Figure 2E). Epitope clusters containing conserved residues at
the HA stem belonging to the HA Group 1 broadly neutralizing epitope (20, 29, 32) similarly align.
Taken together, these results suggest that the mutability of surface spike epitopes of
circulating viruses can be described using a phase diagram (Figure 2F). The mutability of epitope
clusters that lay on a linear line of epitope cluster entropy vs. epitope cluster affinity is related to
the average Ab pressure acting on these residues (Figure 2F). Epitope clusters below the line are
more conserved than would be expected based on their accessibility to Ab pressure and could be
due to the presence of functionally important sites. Epitope clusters above that line are more
mutable than would be expected due to Ab pressure and may result from allosteric immune escape
(45), escapes from CD8+ T cells (46, 47), glycosylation (48), or other factors.
The mutability map of the sarbecovirus spike follows geometry-dependent antibody pressure
Coronaviruses are capable of crossing the species barriers in zoonotic shifts resulting in the
SARS-CoV pandemic in the year 2002-2004 and the 2012 MERS pandemic (4). To understand
whether the geometrical principles controlling the distribution of mutation on the spike surface are
general across species, we applied our computational model to study the mutability of the spike
protein of close relatives of SARS-CoV-2 – the sarbecovirus subgenus. We considered two
presentations of the corona spike (S protein) to Abs: 1) Presentation as soluble full-length S trimer
in its closed form (49) (S Figure 3A-i); 2) S presentation on the coronavirus surface (Figure 3A-i)
[based on the cryo-EM structure of SARS that has 65 spikes on its surface (50) and SARS-CoV2
spike (49) (See Material and Methods)].
We first used in-silico simulation to estimate the Ab affinity to surface residues of S, when
presented as a trimer or the surface of the virus model (See Material and Methods). Similarly to
our observation for the Abs affinity against HA, we found an increased affinity to convex regions,

an affinity gradient along the main axis of S for the virus presentation (Figure 3A-ii), but not for
the trimer presentation (S Figure 3A-ii). Next, we analyzed sequences of close relatives of the
SARS-CoV-2 spike within the sarbecovirus subgenus (Table 1). Following alignment and
construction of the phylogenetic tree (S Figure 4), we computed the mutational entropy of each
surface residue identified as an epitope using eq.(1) (Figure 3B-i) and superimposed it on the spike
surface to create its mutability map (Figure 3B-ii). We observed that the most significant change
in mutability is along the main axis of S. To quantitatively compare the affinity and mutability
maps, we applied the diffusion map transformation on S and clustered the epitopes (Figure 3C).
Studying the correlation value as a function of cluster size (Figure 3D), we found that the
correlation between the model and the mutability map is always higher for the virus spike
presentation compared to the trimer, highlighting that the geometrical context in which Abs
interact with the spike determines its mutability. We found a high degree of correlation (R=0.69)
between CEnt ,k and C Aff ,k , suggesting that affinity as computed by our model, at this resolution,
can explain 48% of the variability in the mutability map of S (Figure 3E). The high degree of
correlation between entropy and affinity suggests that average Ab pressure shaped, to the first
order, the mutability of the sarbecovirus subgenus spike. While for seasonal influenza, the HA
entropy (Figure 1C) was the result of a gradual accumulation of mutations over time, S protein
entropy (Figure 3B) analyzed here is the result of a horizontal mutational process occurring
simultaneously in different hosts, suggesting the virus evolves under similar geometrical
immunoglobulin pressure.
The receptor-binding domain (RBD) is involved in the spike binding to ACE-2 (51, 52). It
has been shown that neutralizing Abs targeting the RBD can offer protection (14). Within the
RBD, residues belonging to the receptor-binding motif (RBM) are most important in binding to

ACE-2. We recognized epitope clusters to which residues part of the RBD and RBM belong
(Figure 3E). Many of the epitope clusters have both high entropy and high affinity, which could
suggest mutations acquired at these key domains across the spike are due to evasion from Abs, as
well as adaptation to the host-specific receptor. Several of the highly targeted and mutable epitope
clusters are not part of the RBD. Hence, Abs targeting these residues will not necessarily offer
neutralization activity. However, Abs targeting these clusters can control viral infection through
non-neutralizing pathways (53), thereby motivating the virus to mutate these highly targeted parts.
SARS-CoV2 and the 2009 influenza pandemic spikes mutability is not predominantly due to
antibody-pressure
Our analysis suggested that spike presentation geometry is an important factor governing
the mutational entropy of viruses circulating either over long periods (influenza) or across species
(sarbecoviruses). To find whether this observation can be generalized to pandemics, we computed
the sequence entropy of HA for the 2009 flu pandemic H1N1 (sequences from (41), GISAID)
(Figure 4C-i). Superimposing the entropy on the HA structure (Figure 4A-ii), we did not observe
immunodominance gradient along the main axis of HA observed in the computational model
(Figure 1A-ii). Unlike for the mutability of seasonal flu, the correlation coefficient between epitope
cluster pandemic entropy and epitope cluster affinity was low (0.18) (Figure 4A-iii).
SARS-CoV-2 zoonotically shifted to humans in 2019 (5), probably from Bats via
pangolins, although its precise evolutionary path is still unclear. Since then, it has spread in the
human population, infecting more than 35 million people as of October 2020. Because of its
proofreading capability, the virus evolution is slow. To analyze its total mutational entropy up to
November 1st, 2020, we downloaded publically available SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID
(www.gisaid.org) (54) (sequences choice is discussed in Material and Methods), computed the

sequence entropy (Figure 4B-i), and superimposed it on the close structure of the spike (Figure
4B-ii). Interestingly, the mutability map does not show the same gradient pattern as observed for
the sarbecovirus subgenus spike entropy (Figure 3B-ii). We applied the same clustering ( k = 60 )
to compare the epitope cluster entropy and affinity and found a low value of the correlation
coefficient (-0.047) (Figure 4B). Hence, the total sequence entropy of SARS-CoV-2 thus far is
not dominanted by escape from Ab mutations.
Time evolution of SARS-CoV-2 mutability map
To see if we could observe changes in the evolution trend of the virus of the time, indicative
of Ab escape mutations, we separated SARS-CoV-2 sequences into five groups based on the time
at which they were captured: 1] before 02/2020, 2] 02/2020-06/2020, 3] 07/2020-08/2020, 4]
09/2020, and 5] 10/2020 (Figure 4C-G). Computing the correlation coefficient between the Ab
affinity map and the sequence entropy, we found a significant increase over time (Figure 4H) from
a value of -0.18 in Feb 2020 to 0.46 for sequences sampled during 10/2020. While the correlation
value of 0.46 is still low, this may point that escape from Abs mutations are starting to be a more
significant part of its population, in accordance with other reports (16, 55). An increase over
months and years in correlation value between the affinity map computed by our model and the
evolving mutational landscape of SARS-CoV-2 could indicate that its mutability patterns are being
shaped

Discussion
Humoral immunity is often characterized by dominant versus recessive responses to different
epitopes on the same antigen. This hierarchy of B cell immunodominance depends on many
factors, amongst them are the precursor frequency within the germline B cell repertoire, BCR

affinity, and the steric accessibility or antigen geometry. Pathogens take advantage of antigen
geometry to shield sites of vulnerability. Such is the case in influenza spike hemagglutinin, where
conserved sites are located and the sterically hidden stem (56-58), or on HIV spike gp120 where
the vulnerable and evolutionary conserved CD4 binding site position does not allow Abs to form
bivalent interactions, reducing the effective affinity of Abs (59). While mature Abs are
nevertheless capable of approaching sterically restricted sites via somatic hypermutations that
could extend, for example, their CDR3 loops (60), immunogen shape and valency manipulates B
cell immunodominance patterns, their selection process in the germinal center or the expansion of
memory B cell population (24, 61, 62). Because viruses must evade Ab response to survive, B
cells immunodominance patterns could be a proxy to glycoprotein mutability, coupled through
antigen geometry. Thus, we studied whether spike presentation geometry to Abs is a good
predictor of their mutability. Using a coarse-grained model of an antibody, HA, and the S protein
of SARS-CoV-2, in both trimer and viral presentation model system, we computed the Ab affinity
maps as a proxy for Ab pressure on the spike. We used those maps to assess whether the magnitude
of mutability at a cluster of sites is just what would be expected by geometrical considerations
(Figure 2F).
We found that for the seasonal flu spike – HA, geometry through the presentation on the
virus could explain, to the first order, the mutability patterns at its surface. In particular, the
mutability of the five antigenic sites is ordered as would be expected by the geometric restriction
imposed by their position on the spike, as did the conserved group 1 epitope, which is functionally
important for HA conformation change (Figure 2E). Hence, we speculate that rather than
maintaining functionally important sites conserved by negatively selecting mutants at such sites,

the virus positions functional sites at a location, where their acceptable mutational rate would be
determined by their need to escape from targeting by the average polyclonal Ab response.
To understand whether a similar principle governs the mutability of coronaviruses, we
created a similar coarse-grained model of the SARS CoV family. As coronaviruses do not mutate
much, we decided to analyze its mutability across the virus sub-species, using sequences isolated
from different hosts in the years 2003-2019. In mammalians, these viruses have to evade
immunoglobulin response which we hypothesized would lead to geometrically similar escape
patterns. We found that geometry, through Ab targeting, shapes to the first order the mutability
patterns on the sarbecovirus subgenus spike map. Hence, these viruses evolve across various hosts
under roughly geometrically-similar Ab pressure – at least the main axis of the virus seems to be
the first, principles axis of mutability resulting from the density of spikes on the viral surface.
The mutational probability distribution we sampled for the sarbecovirus subgenus is
analogous to sampling different “realizations” of the statistical ensemble of the sequence landscape
of the viruses (63), where each realization is a viral from a different host. For the seasonal flu, we
considered sequences over a large period - starting from 1918 and aggregate them to a single
probability distribution analyzed. In both cases, presentation geometry roughly explained sequence
entropy. Comparing both these approaches to describe mutability distribution is conceptually
similar to the ergodic theorem in statistical physics, where the averages of a stochastic process
sampled over time are equivalent to the averages computed over different statistical realizations.
While evolution patterns of mutating viruses are not an ergodic system in general – as many
mutants are not viable, and hence unreachable in the sequence space, the similar geometry of
immunoglobulins and spike presentations could be is the reason our model works for both these

sarbecoviruses). Statistical physics models have been previously used (64) to analyze the sequence
space to compute the fitness landscape space of viruses (65, 66). The overall fitness of viruses is
often split into its intrinsic fitness of the virus and fitness component related to evasion from the
immune response (i.e. Abs) (67). As our approach allows for rough estimation, from first principle,
of the virus Ab-dependent element of the fitness, it can be used as a prior in inference methods of
the intrinsic fitness.
Because of its proofreading mechanism, SARS-CoV-2 is not expected to mutate much.
Nevertheless, since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has erupted, its sequences have been analyzed to
detect mutations that would increase its fitness, infection capabilities, or allow it to escape from
Abs (16, 17, 55, 68). To see if we can find traces of escape due to Ab pressure on the SARS-CoV2 spike, we compared its mutability map to our computed affinity map over time and found an
increase in the correlation value since the beginning of the pandemic (Figure 4H). While the
correlation value of 0.46 computed for October 2020 is still low, it could suggest the spike starts
to acquire some escape from Ab mutations. Since the RBD is involved in binding to ACE2,
mutations at this domain could also modify the binding energy to the receptor. Interestingly, for
the 2009 influenza pandemic, we found a low correlation value of 0.18. This could suggest that
the 2009 flu pandemic has not been evolving for long enough under Ab pressure for the geometric
pattern to be apparent and that the evolution of pandemic viruses is not, at least initially, directed
by Ab pressure acting on their surface residues. It is more likely that mutations that accumulate in
their spikes serve to increase their fitness and infecting capabilities in humans. Additionally, it is
possible that pandemics do not elicit as strong a memory recall as seasonal/circulating viruses, and
hence do not need to evolve as rapidly to escape Ab immune pressure.

We propose here a simple geometrical interpretation of the surface mutational landscape
of that spike that could inform, based on sequences and the 3D structure alone, whether a dominant
component of virus evolution is evasion from Abs. This technique could serve as an indicator of
the evolutionary stage in the infection trajectory of a virus and whether it is on its way to becoming
a circulating virus such as the seasonal flu.

Materials and Methods
The geometry of immunogens and epitope choice
The first input to our model was an atomistic description of the geometry of our immunogens,
which we generated from available structural information and pdb files (49, 69). For HA and S,
solvent-accessible residues were identified using pymol script “findSurfaceResidues”
(https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/FindSurfaceResidues), which identifies atoms with a solvent
accessible area greater than or equal to 20 Ang2 (HA) and 15 Ang2 (S). We then find the residues
to which those atoms belong to. This selection criterion gives a uniformly distributed set of
residues on the face of HA and S (see S Figure 1A, B). A total of 184 epitopes (residues) were
chosen for HA and 254 epitopes for S.
We constructed a simplified model of the influenza virus, in which 40 HA molecules are
arranged in a fixed conformation on a sphere of radius equal to 16nm (a value chosen for
computational tractability). The model recapitulates (24) the average spacing between adjacent
HA on the influenza viral surface of ~ 14 nm (Harris et al., 2013). We also constructed a simplified
model of the coronavirus based on the cryo-EM images of the SARS virus, in which 65 S
molecules in closed form (49) are arranged in a fixed conformation on a sphere of radius equal to
87nm (50), resulting in a density of 0.27 spike pre 100nm2.
Steric constraints affect the access of antibodies to epitopes and this modifies the on-rate,
thus modulating the affinity. To compute the relative magnitude of this effect for different epitopes
presented by immunogens with different geometries, we employed MD simulations. In these
simulations, a Lennard-Jones potential describes the interactions of antibodies with the
immunogen atoms, and a separate Morse-potential is used to model interactions of the antigen
binding region of the Ab to its specific cognate epitope (see Table S 1). To estimate the steric

effects alone, we first assumed that the affinity of Abs to all epitopes was equal in the absence of
steric constraints. We then used MD simulations (Lammps software) (70) to compute the average
time for the Ab antigen-binding region (S Figure 1C-D) to find the target epitope for the first time,
which is called a “first passage time”. By running simulations multiple times, and then averaging
over many simulations, we could estimate the mean first passage time to the epitope. The inverse
of the mean first-passage time is the on-rate, and thus we computed the relative on-rates for Ab
binding to different epitopes for different immunogen geometries. We take the on-rate of the first
arm of the Ab model as a proxy for Ab affinity to a residue.
Coarse-grained model of the antibody
To estimate the encounter probability and rate of different residues on the surface on the
immunogens by the Ab, we employed coarse-grained MD simulations. The B cell receptor is
represented using 8 beads (see S Figure 1). We used a coarse-grained model of the Ag and Ab (see
S Figure 1). In (71), a model of the Ab was suggested, built from ellipsoids and spheres. Here, we
built our Ab model using spheres of different sizes to approximate the same dimension and
flexibility of the Ab. The MD simulation system is composed of different beads (see Table S 1).
This size of the beads was chosen such that the distance between the two Fabs is approximately
15nm and the length of the Ab arm is 7nm (72). The size of the Fc region is chosen to be 5nm (73)
(see Table S 1). To construct the 7nm arm we use 3 beads (types 4,5,6 – S Figure 1B-C, Table S
1), where nearest-neighbor beads are connected with rigid bonds of length 1.75nm. Bead type 4
(arm hinge) is connected to bead 3 (Fc hinge) by a rigid bond of length 1.75nm. The epitope bead
(type 7, Table S 1) was chosen to have the same size as the Fab beads (1.75nm) (Table S 1). The
beads along the arm (type 4,5,6) are on a straight line (no kink), and the middle bead (type 6) is
larger, to approximate the elongated ellipsoid shaped arm of the Ab (71).

4.2nm (Table S 1) to maintain an angle of approximately 120 degrees between the arms. The
interaction distance of other pairs of beads is the sum of their radii (Table S 2).
Estimating the on-rates to the epitopes
The on-rate to each of the residues is estimated using MD simulations. Each simulation
runs for a predetermined amount of time and we find the diffusion-limited first passage time of
one of the Fabs to the neighborhood of the target residue. The on-rate for the first arm to find an

model).

The sequences analyzed here of the seasonal influenza H1N1 and the 2009 influenza pandemic are
from (Kirkpatrick et al., 2018) - which originate from www.gisaid.org. SARS-CoV-2 sequences
were downloaded on November 8th, 2020 from www.gisaid.org. Out of a total of 189550, only
high quality (complete) sequences of length 1274 amino acid (135216 sequences) were analyzed.
The consensus sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was calculated using the BLOSUM50 scoring matrix in
Matlab. Sequences of the sarbecovirus subgenus were downloaded from www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
(see Table 1). The alignment of those sequences was done using ‘GONNET’ scoring matrix in
Matlab. Find an interactive, time-dependent comparison of the mutability map to the affinity map
