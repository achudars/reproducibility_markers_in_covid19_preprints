Abstract
The rapid development and deployment of mRNA-based vaccines against the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to the design of accelerated vaccination
schedules that have been extremely effective in naïve individuals. While a two-dose immunization
regimen with the BNT162b2 vaccine has been demonstrated to provide a 95% efficacy in naïve
individuals, the effects of the second vaccine dose in individuals who have previously recovered
from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection has been questioned. Here we characterized SARS-CoV-2
spike-specific humoral and cellular immunity in naïve and previously infected individuals during
full BNT162b2 vaccination. Our results demonstrate that the second dose increases both the
humoral and cellular immunity in naïve individuals. On the contrary, the second BNT162b2
vaccine dose results in a reduction of cellular immunity in COVID-19 recovered individuals, which
suggests that a second dose, according to the current standard regimen of vaccination, may be
not necessary in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Manuscript
The BNT162b2 mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine was authorized for
emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines
Agency (EMA) in December 2020 [1]. The vaccination strategy for the BNT162b2 vaccine
involves an accelerated two-dose vaccination regimen administered 21 days apart, which has
been demonstrated to induce a spike-specific humoral and cellular immunity associated with a
95% efficacy in naïve individuals [2]. However, in individuals with prior exposure to SARS-CoV2, the utility of the second dose has been challenged. While robust spike-specific antibodies and
T cells are induced by a single dose vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals [3, 4],
the second vaccination dose appears to exert a detrimental effect in the overall magnitude of
the spike-specific humoral response in COVID-19 recovered individuals [5].
The effects of the second dose mRNA vaccine on spike-specific T cell expansion and
contraction are however unknown in both naïve and in SARS-CoV-2 pre-exposed individuals.
Understanding this gap of knowledge is critical since protection from disease severity and
infection are likely to be dependent on the coordinated activation of both the humoral and
cellular arms of adaptive immunity [6]. The complexity of monitoring virus-specific T cell
magnitude and function has so far prevented the full characterization of the immune cellular
response to the vaccine. To address this problem, we have shown that SARS-CoV-2-specific T
cells (both CD4 helper and CD8 cytotoxic) can be reliably quantified in both SARS-CoV-2
infected individuals [7] and vaccine recipients [11] by a direct and quantitative ex vivo
measurement of IFN-gamma secreted by whole blood samples stimulated with a pool of viral
peptides.
Using this experimental approach, we studied the kinetics of T cell immunity at multiple time
points (i.e. prior to, and 10 and 20 days after the first and second dose of vaccine) in 46
individuals with and without previous documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (23 naïve; mean age
39.9 years [range, 20 to 62], female 78%) and 23 PCR/antigen test-confirmed SARS-CoV-2
recovered (39% at 6-9 months after infection, 26% 3-6 months, 35% 1-3 months) (mean age
44.3 years [range, 20 to 76]; female 76%). Prior to vaccination, spike peptide pool-induced IFNgamma production in whole blood of COVID-19 recovered individuals was higher than in naïve
subjects (median pre-vaccination in naïve: 1.0 pg/ml [N=20] and in COVID-19 recovered: 46.9
pg/ml [N=21]) (Fig.1A). Using our modified protocol to evaluate IFN-gamma expression in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by flow cytometry [8], we demonstrated that SARSCoV-2 spike and peptide pools stimulated the secretion of IFN-gamma in effector antigenspecific CD4+ effector T cells in COVID-19 recovered but not in naïve donors, confirming the
presence of memory SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4+ T cells in individuals with prior exposure to this
virus (Supp. Fig.1) and that IFN-gamma released in whole blood reliably detects the Spikespecific T cell response.
Evaluation of the spike-specific T cell response 10 days after the first dose indicates that
COVID-19 recovered individuals mount a stronger IFN-gamma response in comparison with
naïve subjects (median day 10 post-first vaccine dose in naïve: 110.4 pg/ml [N=20] and in
COVID-19 recovered: 520 pg/ml [N=21]) (Fig.1A). Interestingly, while COVID-19 recovered
individuals maintain their T cell immunity on day 20 post-first vaccine dose, IFN-gamma
response in naïve individuals rapidly decreases (median day 20 post-first vaccine dose in naïve:
31.3 pg/ml [N=23] and in COVID-19 recovered: 278.0 pg/ml [N=21]). These results indicate that
individuals with pre-existing immunity exert a more potent and sustained T cell response to
SARS-CoV-2 spike after the first dose of the vaccine, consistent with recent investigations [12].
We next studied the effects of the second dose of the vaccine. Sampling on day 10 after the
second dose confirmed the beneficial effects of the recall vaccine in naïve individuals who

increase their IFN-gamma to significant levels (median day 10 post-second vaccine dose in
naïve: 162.0 pg/ml [N=20] vs median pre-vaccination in naïve: 1.0 pg/ml [N=20]; p=0.0003).
Interestingly, we observed a similar trend when measuring SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG
levels, which indicates that naïve individuals achieve significant concentrations of IgG
antibodies after the second vaccine dose (Fig.1B), suggesting that protection is achieved
following the standard two-dose regimen for COVID-19 vaccination in naïve individuals.
Unexpectedly, COVID-19 recovered individuals significantly decreased their IFN-gamma
production on day 10 after the second vaccine dose (median day 10 post-second vaccine dose
in COVID-19 recovered: 212.0 pg/ml [N=21] vs median pre-vaccination in COVID-19 recovered:
46.9 pg/ml [N=21]; p=0.0032) (Fig.1A). These findings indicate that, while naïve subjects
significantly increase their immunity against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein after the second dose of
the vaccine, COVID-19 recovered individuals do not seem to benefit from the standard regimen
for COVID-19 vaccination. We observed no differences in IFN-gamma secretion between naïve
and COVID-19 recovered individuals on day 20 after the second dose (median day 20 postsecond vaccine dose naïve: 87.5 pg/ml [N=23] and COVID-19 recovered: 136.0 pg/ml [N=23]).
Our analysis of humoral and cellular spike-specific immunity in recipients of the BNT162b2
mRNA COVID-19 vaccine indicates that a single dose of the vaccine elicits the generation of
specific antibodies and a T cell immune response in naïve and COVID-19 recovered individuals,
consistent with recently published data [4] and [12]. In naïve subjects, the T cell response
decays rapidly after the first vaccine dose, but is boosted in conjunction with spike-specific IgG
levels after the second dose. On the contrary, in individuals with a pre-existing immunity against
SARS-CoV-2, the second vaccine dose not only fail to boost humoral immunity (Fig.1B) but
determines a contraction of the spike-specific T cell response. Thus, these data argue in favor
of meeting the vaccination scheme determined in clinical trials with prompt administration of the
second dose in individuals without previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure [9]. On the other hand,
individuals with pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 should be spared the second dose
of the vaccine, at least temporarily, to prevent a possible contraction of their spike-specific
memory T cell immunity. Our study has clear limitations.
Due to its observational nature, the mechanisms of the contraction of the spike-induced
production of IFN-gamma in COVID-19 recovered subjects observed after the second
vaccination dose were not investigated. We can only hypothesize that the effector memory
CD4+ T cells expanded by first vaccine dose in COVID-19 recovered individuals may be prone
to activation-induced cell death (AICD) after the second vaccination dose. We cannot however
exclude that the second dose of the vaccine may only functionally exhaust the spike-specific T
cells without really reducing the quantity of the long-term pool of effector memory T cells.
Therefore, more detailed analysis of the phenotype of the spike-specific T cells induced by
COVID-19 vaccines both in naïve and recovered individuals are needed to answer these
questions.
At present, there is a shortage of doses to vaccinate a large proportion of the population and
public health authorities are designing priority vaccination strategies according to age,
comorbidities and risk assessment criteria. We conclude that using ex vivo SARS-CoV2 specific
cellular immunity tests may allow health authorities to screen individuals for pre-existing
immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and update their priority strategy for ongoing vaccination
campaigns against COVID-19 to provide vaccination certificates to those individuals with preexisting immunity after the first vaccine dose.

Materials and Methods
SARS-CoV-2 Peptide pools
SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools of 15-mers (55 peptides) covering 40.5% of the Spike protein and
contain most of the SARS-CoV2 spike epitope published to date [10] were used as reported in [7]
Whole blood culture with SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools
320 μl of whole blood drawn on the same day were mixed with 80 μl RPMI and stimulated with
pools of SARS-CoV-2 peptides (S; 2 μg/ml) or a DMSO control. After 15 hours of culture, the
supernatant (plasma) was collected and stored at -80ºC until quantification of cytokines.
Cytokine quantification and analysis
Cytokine concentrations in the plasma were quantified using Ella with microfluidic multiplex
cartridges measuring IFN-γ following the manufacturer’s instructions (ProteinSimple, San Jose,
California). The level of cytokines present in the plasma of DMSO controls was subtracted from
the corresponding peptide pool stimulated samples.
Spike-specific IgG quantification
The ACCESS SARS-CoV-2 CLIA (Beckman Coulter Inc., California, USA) was used for
semiquantitative detection of IgG directed against S protein RBD using serum obtained from
venipuncture blood. Samples were tested on a UniCel Dxl 800 high-performance analyser.
Flow Cytometry
Subjects were recruited from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine under an institutional review
board–approved protocol and informed consent obtained from all subjects. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by means of density centrifugation with Ficoll-Paque
Plus (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) and cultured in AIM-V medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY)
with 2.5% AB human serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Inc., West Sacramento, CA). PBMCs were
unstimulated (DMSO) or stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) peptide pools (5 mg/mL) in
presence of GolgiPlug (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for 6 hours. Harvested PBMCs were
stained for viability (Live/Dead Fixable, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), washed and stained for
surface markers, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Services, Hatfield, PA),
and treated with permeabilization buffer (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) before staining with
labeled antibodies to detect intracellular CD154 and cytokines. Stained cells were analyzed
subsequently on a CytekTM Aurora device (Cytek Biosciences, Fremont, CA).
Statistical analysis
For IgG and IGN-gamma determination, statistical comparison between groups was performed
using ANOVA test (**£ 0.003; *** £ 0.0003; *** £ 0.0001). For flow cytometry studies, statistical
comparison between groups was performed using t-test (**£ 0.003).
