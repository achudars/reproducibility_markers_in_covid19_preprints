Abstract:
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in humans. Despite several emerging vaccines, there
remains no verifiable therapeutic targeted specifically to the virus. Here we present a highly
effective siRNA therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 infection using a novel lipid nanoparticle
delivery system. Multiple small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting highly conserved regions of
the SARS-CoV-2 virus were screened and three candidate siRNAs emerged that effectively inhibit
virus by greater than 90% either alone or in combination with one another. We simultaneously
developed and screened two novel lipid nanoparticle formulations for the delivery of these
candidate siRNA therapeutics to the lungs, an organ that incurs immense damage during SARSCoV-2 infection. Encapsulation of siRNAs in these LNPs followed by in vivo injection
demonstrated robust repression of virus in the lungs and a pronounced survival advantage to the
treated mice. Our LNP-siRNA approaches are scalable and can be administered upon the first sign
of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. We suggest that an siRNA-LNP therapeutic approach could
prove highly useful in treating COVID-19 disease as an adjunctive therapy to current vaccine
strategies.

Introduction
Coronaviruses have been previously linked to public health crises including the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) outbreak in 2003 and the Middle East
Respiratory Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. These viruses led to approximately 8,096
infections for SARS-CoV-1 and 1,728 infections for MERS (WHO reports, 2004 and 2016). In
contrast, the highly transmissible novel SARS-CoV-2 virus quickly escalated to a pandemic with
over 128 million cases reported worldwide along with multi-organ failure, acute respiratory
distress syndrome and death in the elderly and in those with underlying morbidities. The race to
develop a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine began swiftly and is ongoing, however the emergence of viral
variants has demonstrated the limited effectiveness of some vaccines to these variants (1, 2). These
observations suggest an urgent and unmet need for SARS-CoV-2 specific therapies to treat
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While Dexamethasone and Remdesivir appear to provide
some benefit to COVID-19 patients (3), a therapeutic targeted to directly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 is
lacking.
RNA encodes the genome of Coronaviruses, rendering them highly susceptible to RNA
interference (4) (5-7), particularly when delivered to the lungs of primates (8). Small interfering
RNAs (siRNAs) are short double stranded RNA molecules that induce gene silencing at the
transcriptional or post-transcriptional level and can be delivered to the lungs through either
intranasal or intravenous routes (9, 10). We report here the screening of several siRNAs targeted
to highly conserved regions of SARS-COV-2 that block virus expression and replication.
Moreover, we find that the top candidate siRNAs are able to functionally repress virus expression
in vivo and inhibit the emergence of COVID-19 disease when delivered intravenously using
particular lipid nanoparticle (LNP) siRNA formulations.
Results
siRNA targeting SARS-CoV-2
To determine the effectiveness of RNAi to SARS-CoV-2 we designed several siRNAs targeted to
the ultra-conserved regions in the RNA dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp), Helicase (Hel), and
5’ untranslated leader region (5’UTR). Ultra-conserved siRNAs that target structurally accessible
regions were discovered by (a) characterizing the 29,903bp RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 for
structural features (11), (b) sequence conservation (12), (c) RNA modifications (13) and (d) the
absence of seed sequences in the human transcriptome. We used these data to prioritize
approximately 9500 candidate siRNAs generated by OligoWalk (14) and DSIR (15). In addition,
163 experimentally validated SARS-CoV-1 siRNAs were assessed for homology with SARSCoV-2 (16). From this stringent bioinformatic approach 18 siRNAs were selected (Figure 1A,
Table S1). The panel of siRNAs screened displayed varying effects on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro
(Figures 1B-C) with siRNAs Hel1, Hel2, siUC7 and siUTR3 demonstrating the most potent and
dose-dependent repression of virus expression (Figure 1D). Candidates siHel1 and siHel2 are
within highly conserved regions and are able to target both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2
(Figures S1A-B).
Chemical modifications can be used to stabilize siRNAs, which results in a longer-term expression
and persistence in vivo and generally more potent repression (17). We selected siUTR3, as this

target site resides in stem loop 1, a highly conserved region in the 5’UTR required for downstream
transcriptional processing and expression of several viral RNAs (18). We find that 2’ O-methyl
chemical modifications embedded into siUTR3 (Figure S2) exhibit increased stability in serum
(Figure S2) and that repression of SARS-CoV-2 is maintained, although it is less potent than the
non-modified siUTR3 (Figures 1B and E). We also found that none of the siRNAs tested
demonstrated any observable immunostimulatory activity on human macrophages (Figures S3AB).
SARS-COV-2 is able to rapidly evolve mutations that make the virus refractory to antibody
targeting (1, 2, 19). It is well known with other RNA viruses, like human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV), that single siRNA targeting results in the emergence of viral resistance (20) while
combinations of siRNAs have been shown to hamper the emergence of resistant variants (21). To
ascertain if combining siRNAs can functionally target SARS-CoV-2 we selected and screened
three highly repressive siRNAs (siUTR3, siUC7 and siHel1) alone and in combination for
repression of virus expression. Interestingly, we find that mixtures of siRNAs offered the same
viral knockdown as was observed with single targeted siRNAs, even though the concentration of
individual siRNAs in each combination was proportionally lower (50% for two siRNAs and 33%
for three siRNAs)(Figure 1F). Collectively, these data suggest that siRNAs Hel1, Hel2, siUC7
and siUTR3 either alone or in combination can potently target and repress SARS-CoV-2, that
siUTR3 can be chemically modified and retain function, and that these siRNAs do not induce
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) innate immune activation
pathways.
Lipid Nanoparticle in vivo delivery of anti-SARS-COV-2 siRNAs
Developing therapeutic strategies for viral infections based on siRNAs has so far proved
challenging, with poor clinical success primarily being the result of subpar delivery. SARS-CoV2 infection occurs predominantly in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and results in diffuse
alveolar damage (22). Macrophage and monocytes are also infected with SARS (23) and may be
one source of the observed cytokine storm in COVID-19 disease (24, 25). We previously
developed an intravenous liposome delivery platform that resulted in robust delivery of siRNAs to
the lungs in vivo (9, 10). Unlike standard liposomes, these “stealth” lipid nanoparticles (sLNPs)
are formulated to be stable in serum, circulate for long periods of time, and to protect siRNA
payloads from nucleases. These liposomes can be formulated based on alterations of size and
composition to traffic to the lung (9, 10).
Previously published work fully characterized the sLNPs with an average size of 190nm,
polydispersity index of 0.326, zeta potential of 52.1 millivolts (mV), and 94.8% siRNA
encapsulation efficiency (9). Additionally, this work demonstrated that sLNPs can target the lung
(~35%), liver (~55%) and spleen (~10%)(9, 10). Recent studies have found that increased
concentrations of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-Propane (DOTAP) with DLin-MC3-DMA
(MC3) into the LNP formulations results in enhanced targeting to the lung (26). As such we sought
to contrast earlier formulated sLNPs containing 50% DOTAP with next generation modified LNPs
containing 40% DOTAP+MC3 (dmLNP) for delivery of anti-SARS-CoV-2 siRNAs in vivo using
the K18-hACE2 mouse model of COVID-19 disease (27). First, to validate the pathogenicity of
SARS-CoV-2 in the K18-hACE2 mouse model, mice were inoculated with 4x104 PFU of virus.
Within the first 4 days dramatic weight loss of ~20% of body weight, occurred (Figure S4A) with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.19.440531; this version posted April 19, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

a corresponding heightened clinical score (Figure S4B). Infected K18-hACE2 mice also exhibited
high viral load in the lung (Figure S4C), and brain (Figure S4D), which was infectious upon serial
passage (Figure S4E). These data demonstrate, similar to previous observations with SARS-CoV1 (20, 23), that the K18-hACE2 mouse model exhibits COVID-19 disease when infected with
SARS-CoV-2.
Next, to determine the ability of the sLNP-siRNAs to functionally repress SARS-CoV-2, K18hACE2 mice were inoculated with 1x104 PFU of virus and treated with various sLNP-siRNA
formulations intravenously (Figure 2A). We find that sLNP-siRNA treatment provided a survival
advantage in the sLNP-siUC7 and sLNP-siHel2 treated mice compared to virus infected and sLNPsiRNA control treated mice (Figure 2B). The functionally treated mice exhibited less weight loss
(Figure 2C) and an overall lower clinical score (Figure 2D) when compared to the control sLNPsiRNA and virus infected mice. Notably, both the sLNP-siUC7 and sLNP-siHel2 treated mice
functionally repressed SARS-CoV-2 in vivo at day 3 based on viral outgrowth analysis from lung
(Figure 2D) but this effect was lost by day 6, suggesting that the repressive effect of the siRNAs
is transient and found ~24-48hrs following sLNP-siRNA treatment. Markedly, the siRNA treated
mice appeared most closely aligned with the mock treated mice when the transcriptomic profile of
lung from day 6 was characterized (Figure 2F and Table S2). The sLNP-siRNAs assessed here
contain ~50% DOTAP which is a cationic lipid often used in nanoparticle and liposome
formulations. Cationic liposomes can aggregate and lead to accumulation in the spleen, liver and
lung. Notably, the sLNP-siRNA formulations did not appear to exhibit any overt splenomegaly in
treated virus infected mice as determined by post-mortem assessment of the spleens from treated
and control animals at day 3 (Figure S5A) and day 6 (Figure S5B) post-treatment. Collectively,
these data demonstrate that intravenous (IV) injected sLNP-siRNAs can repress SARS-CoV-2 in
vivo and delay the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and that siHel2 appears to be a potent siRNA
for repressing viral expression when delivered intravenously with sLNPs.
The sLNP-siRNAs (Figure 2) contain 50% DOTAP which contributes to the highly positive
surface charge which has been suggested to activate the immune system (28). To assess the
immune stimulatory properties of the sLNP-siRNAs, we assessed mouse lung gene expression
profiles using NanoString immune gene expression profiling analysis at day 6. Stimulation of
interferon-regulated immune genes was observed between mock and virus infected (Figure S6A)
and similar patterns of immune gene activation were observed between the virus infected and the
various sLNP-siRNA treated mice (Figures S6B-D, Table S3), suggesting that siRNA treatment
in these mice was not overtly immune-stimulatory.
While we did not observe any notable unique immune dysregulation with the sLNP-siRNAs, in
vivo, and the siRNAs alone did not demonstrate any observable immune stimulation in vitro
(Figure S3), recent work has suggested that reducing DOTAP can ameliorate LNP-siRNA
immune stimulation. Based on these concerns, we screened a panel of formulations with reduced
DOTAP at 40, 35, and 30% (Figure S7A). Our goal was to develop a next generation ‘stealth
LNP’ formulation with reduced DOTAP and in turn incorporate the cationic ionizable lipid MC3
to help facilitate the endosomal release of siRNAs. We observe that our reduced DOTAP LNP
formulations range from 80 to 115 nm in size and display low polydispersity values (Figure S7B).
The zeta potential of our reduced DOTAP LNP formulations range from 17 to 23 mV (Figure
S7C) and there was little observable difference in the zeta potential values between these new

formulations despite the stepwise reduction in DOTAP (Figure S7C). Because highly positive
surface charges of nanoparticles and liposomes are linked to toxicity (28) we view our reduction
in surface charge as compared to the previous sLNP-siRNA formulation as a favourable step
toward reducing potential toxicity. Furthermore, all formulations in our panel had ≥92%
encapsulation efficiency of siRNA cargo (Figure S7D) and transmission electron microscope
imaging of the DOTAP40 LNPs exhibited a uniform spherical shape (Figure S7E). Remarkably,
the DOTAP40 and DOTAP40C LNPs remain stable for at least 9 months when stored at 4°C with
nearly 100% retention of encapsulated siRNA (Figure S8A-B) and DOTAP40C LNPs retain
function after six days at room temperature. Furthermore, the siRNAs are largely resistant to
enzymatic degradation when encapsulated in these LNPs (Figure S8C-D). Based on these
observations we selected the “DOTAP40C” formulation which contains the highest proportion of
MC3 while also retaining a high proportion of DOTAP which is important for achieving lung
delivery of the candidate SARS-CoV-2 siRNAs. To determine the ability of these newly
formulated DOTAP/MP3 LNP-siRNAs (dmLNP-siRNAs, formerly identified as DOTAP40C) to
effectively target the lung, DiD labelled dmLNP-siRNA formulations (Figures 3A) were
generated and found to be ~80 nm (Figure 3B) with a zeta potential of ~18.58 mV and to
encapsulate ≥97% of the control siRNAs (Figure 3C). When injected intravenously into mice and
assessed 24 hrs later there was localization of DiD fluorescence in the lung (21%), liver (67%) and
less so in the spleen (12%) (Figures 3D-E), which was similar to previous observations with
sLNPs (9, 10).
Next to determine the ability of the dmLNP-siRNAs to deliver functionally repressive siRNAs,
K18-hACE2 mice were inoculated with 1x104 PFU of virus and treated with dmLNP-siRNA
formulations (Figure 4A). We find that mice treated with dmLNP-siHel2 exhibited a survival
advantage (Figure 4B), exhibited less weight-loss (Figure 4C) and a lower clinical score (Figure
4D) when compared to the control dmLNP-siRNA treated and virus infected mice. Further, the
data showed a recovery of weight, and a concomitant decrease in clinical score at days 6-8 in mice
treated with dmLNP-siHel2 and dmLNP-siUC7, suggesting that these treatments may alleviate
severe disease symptoms. Similar to previous observations with sLNP-siRNA formulations
(Figure 2E) both the dmLNP-siUTR3 and dmLNP-siHel2 treated mice functionally repressed
SARS-CoV-2 in vivo at day 7-8 based on viral outgrowth analysis from lung (Figure 4E)
suggesting a bona fide repression of virus in vivo. Collectively, these data demonstrate that
intravenously injected dmLNP-siRNAs, similar to sLNP-siRNA treatments (Figure 2), repress
SARS-CoV-2 in vivo and delay the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and that siUC7, siUTR3 and
siHel2 appear to be potent siRNAs for repressing viral expression.
Discussion
Currently there are scant antivirals reported which directly target SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome.
Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) has recently been used to
target SARS-CoV-2 (29), but pre-existing antibodies to CRISPRs (30) and the need to translate
the packaged CRISPR mRNA and gRNA in virus infected cells will hinder the clinical translation
of this approach. RNAi does not require translation of mRNA, is programmable, scalable, stable
and has been observed to potently repress Coronaviruses (5-7). We show here that RNAi and
particular siRNAs, siHel1, siHel2, UC7 and siUTR3 significantly repress SARS-COV-2 in vitro
and in vivo and could prove to be a useful therapeutic to treating COVID-19 disease. However,

delivery of siRNAs to sites of disease, such as the lungs in COVID-19 afflicted individuals, has
remained enigmatic.
The persistent cough and shortness of breath endemic in COVID-19 disease highlight the lungs as
a site of significant stress and inflammation during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The thick mucosa
associated with COVID-19 will likely impede the delivery of aerosolized therapeutics to infected
tissues and additionally, nebulizers increase droplet dispersion which could lead to infectious
particles remaining in the air thereby increasing the risk of the disease spreading. For these reasons
we surmised that an intravenous route of administration as a backdoor delivery system, might
prove both safe and effective. Building on this notion we turned to “stealth” LNPs (9, 10), which
have been shown to deliver siRNAs to the lung, liver and spleen following an intravenous
administration.
Recent work by Cheng et al., 2020 demonstrated that LNP formulations can be tuned to
specifically target the lung by adjusting the amount of DOTAP incorporated into the particles (22).
Increasing the DOTAP concentration >50% has been reported to result in lung specific expression
of a luciferase mRNA reporter (26). Notably, this group used a combination of DOTAP (50%) and
MC3 (25%) to achieve efficient LNP lung targeting. Our sLNP-siRNAs containing 50% DOTAP
and no MC3 target the lung, however we find the liver and spleen are also targeted (9, 10). Our
dmLNP-siRNAs contain 40% DOTAP and 25% MC3, but also display targeting of the lung, liver
and spleen. Notably, the dmLNP-siRNAs (Figures 3 and 4) contained 40% DOTAP and exhibited
a concomitant reduction in lung targeting when administered intravenously, regardless of the MC3
incorporation, suggesting as others have observed, that DOTAP is the key component to targeting
the lung with LNPs (26). DOTAP is a cationic lipid that contributes to the positive surface charge
of liposomes and LNPs, and has been shown to activate the immune system resulting in systemic
toxicity (31). By reducing the amount of DOTAP in our dmLNP-siRNAs we have reduced the
positive surface charge on the particles by approximately half compared to the sLNP-siRNAs. We
too observed some level of immune stimulation that was most likely the result of viral infection,
and not attributed to the LNP-siRNA formulations as virus infected controls and LNP-siRNA
particle treated mice demonstrated a similar gene expression profile (Figure S6, Tables S2-3).
Notably, the siRNA repression of SARS-CoV-2 appeared to be transient, and the effect of viral
suppression was lost after ~48hrs, suggesting that the LNP-siRNA formulations are rapidly cleared
from the system and that as a therapeutic, a daily intravenous regimen will most likely be required
during peak viral infection. SiRNA modification represents one approach that both reduces
immune stimulation and increases the half-life of the siRNAs in vivo. Our preliminary data suggest
that minimal 2’OMethyl and phosphorothioate modifications are sufficient to increase the stability
of the tested siRNA (UTR3) in vitro. Further optimisation of such modifications will most likely
provide a highly potent and stable siRNA for in vivo delivery.
The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine race led by Pfizer and Moderna has opened the door for future LNP
based therapies. Both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively)
contain an mRNA encoding the Spike protein encapsulated in an LNP delivery vehicle. Prior to
the pandemic, the only FDA approved LNP based therapy was the siRNA-LNP drug Patisiran
(Onpattro) used for the treatment of polyneuropathy caused by hereditary transthyretin-mediated
amyloidosis (32). Recent successes in the clinical translation of LNPs portend a new era in
nanomedicine, whereby LNPs are now viewed favourably as bona fide and safe delivery vehicles
for mRNAs and RNAi. Building on this realized consensus of interpretation we show here that

intravenously administered stealth LNPs can deliver siRNAs as a therapeutic to treat COVID-19.
While both RNAi and LNP technologies are relatively new, it is becoming evident that this next
generation technology is programmable, scalable, stable, relatively safe, and has much to offer as
a therapeutic to specifically target SARS-CoV-2 and treat COVID-19 disease.

and dmLNP-siRNA treatment, (B) probability of survival, (C) Body weight (weight change), and
(D) clinical score were evaluated at the indicated dpi. Mice which lost >15% of their initial body
weight were humanely euthanized and plotted as a non- survivor. (B-D) Mice were weighed and
scored daily until the experimental endpoint for disease progression. (D) The clinical score was
evaluated based on locomotion, behaviour and appearance. Each data point represents the
average ± SEM of 3 to 4 mice. (E) The amount of infectious virus particles in lung tissues at 7 and
8 dpi were titrated determined by immunoplaque assays on Vero E6 cells, using a SARS-CoV-2 N
protein specific antibody and, expressed as PFU per gram of tissue. Each data point represents a
technical replicate, where one mouse is equivalent to 3 technical replicates and bars represent the
average ± SEM. p values of <0.05 (*) and <0.01 (**) are considered statistically significant when
assessed by 2-way ANOVA (Dunnett’s post- test) against (33) SARS-CoV-2 infected only mice and
(E) siControl.
