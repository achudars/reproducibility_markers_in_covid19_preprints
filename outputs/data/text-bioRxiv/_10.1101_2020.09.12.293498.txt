One Sentence Summary: The phosphate prodrug PF-07304814 is disclosed as an
investigational novel intravenous small molecule 3CL protease inhibitor for COVID-19.

Abstract:
COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has become a global pandemic. 3CL protease is a
virally encoded protein that is essential to the viral life cycle across a broad spectrum of
coronaviruses with no close human analogs. The designed phosphate prodrug PF-07304814 is
metabolized to PF-00835231 which is a potent inhibitor in vitro of the coronavirus family 3CL
pro, with selectivity over human host protease targets. Furthermore, PF-00835231 exhibits potent
in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 as a single agent and it is additive/synergistic in
combination with remdesivir. We present the ADME, safety, and in vitro antiviral activity data
to warrant clinical evaluation.

Main Text:
In December 2019, COVID-19 was identified as a new, potentially fatal, respiratory infection
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1, 2). Unlike
previous coronavirus outbreaks that receded relatively quickly, the resultant COVID-19
pandemic spread across the globe. As of August 2020, over 24 million people have been infected
and over 821,000 people have died globally with no approved drugs available to treat the disease
(3).

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor remdesivir is currently undergoing
clinical investigation for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and was granted emergency use
authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2020 (4). To date, trials
of remdesivir have shown significantly decreased recovery time for COVID-19 patients, but the
drug has not had a significant effect on morbidity (5). Other classes of antivirals that exhibit
single agent efficacy or that are complementary to remdesivir for use in combination regimens
are essential to meet this substantial unmet need.

SARS-CoV-2 produces two large viral polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are processed by
two virally encoded cysteine proteases, the main protease, also called 3C-like protease (3CL
protease or 3CLpro) and the papain-like protease. Mutagenesis experiments with other
coronaviruses have demonstrated that the activity of the 3CLpro is essential for viral replication
(6, 7). 3CLpro proteolytically processes the virus p1a/p1ab polyproteins at more than 10
junctions to generate a series of non-structural proteins critical for virus replication and
transcription, including RdRp, the helicase, and the 3CLpro itself (8). No close human analogs of
the coronavirus 3CLpro are known, suggesting that selective 3CLpro inhibitors should avoid
unwanted polypharmacology (9). The essential functional importance of proteases in virus
replication has led to the clinical success of protease inhibitors in combating both human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (10–13). This together with the
opportunity for selectivity, makes 3CLpro an attractive antiviral drug target (14).

Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002-2003 we identified a
potential small molecule protease inhibitor (PF-00835231) for the treatment of SARS-CoV,

using structure based drug design (15). Due to the SARS pandemic being brought under control
in July 2003 following public health measures which incorporated patient isolation and travel
restrictions, this project was discontinued. Given that the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
sequences share 96% identity overall and 100% identity in the active site (1, 16, 17), following
the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, PF-00835231 was identified as a potential SARS-CoV-2
3CLpro inhibitor for the treatment of COVID-19 disease.

Herein we describe the 3CLpro inhibitor, PF-00835231, and its novel phosphate prodrug, PF07304814, and present broad-spectrum antiviral activity along with absorption, distribution,
metabolism, excretion (ADME) and safety data highlighting its potential for the intravenous (IV)
treatment of COVID-19 disease.

Results and Discussion
PF-00835231 exhibits tight and specific binding to SARS-CoV-2 3CL in vitro
Previously, it was shown that PF-00835231 potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro with a Ki
value of 0.27±0.1nM (15). An X-ray co-crystal structure of PF-00835231 bound to SARS-CoV-2
3CLpro is consistent with PF-00835231 binding to the 3CLpro enzyme with a covalent and
reversible interaction at the catalytic cysteine residue of the active site, thus inhibiting the
activity of the 3CLpro (PDB-6XHM) (15). A thermal-shift assay was used to evaluate the direct
binding between PF-00835231 and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The melting temperature of SARSCoV-2 3CLpro was shifted by 14.6℃ upon binding of PF-00835231, from 55.9±0.11℃ (n=16)
to 70.5±0.12℃ (n=8). These data support tight and specific binding of PF-00835231 to SARS-

CoV-2 3CLpro (Fig. 1) and, thereby, provide further evidence for the molecular inhibitory
mechanism of PF-00835231.

PF-00835231 has potent and broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against a panel of coronavirus
3CLpros
Since the active sites of 3CLpro are fairly well conserved across different coronaviruses, it was
hypothesized that PF‑00835231 could be active against other coronaviruses besides SARS-CoV
(15, 18). Consistent with this hypothesis, it was shown that PF‑00835231 was also active against
3CLpros from SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E (15). To further explore the notion that
PF‑00835231 could have pan-coronavirus activity, PF-00835231 was evaluated against 3CLpro
from a variety of other coronaviruses representing alpha, beta and gamma groups of
Coronaviridae, using biochemical Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) protease activity
assays. PF-00835231 demonstrated potent inhibitory activity against all tested coronavirus
3CLpro including members of alpha-coronaviruses (NL63-CoV, PEDV, FIPV), betacoronaviruses (HKU4-CoV, HKU5-CoV, HKU9-CoV, MHV-CoV, OC43-CoV, HKU1-CoV),
and gamma-coronavirus (IBV-CoV), with Ki values, ranging from 30 pM to 4 nM (Table 1). The
demonstrated activity is consistent with a potential therapeutic use against emerging
coronaviruses. This inhibitory activity is restricted to coronavirus 3CLpros as PF-00835231 was
inactive against a panel of human proteases and HIV protease (Table S1). PF-00835231 showed
detectable activity against human cathepsin B but 1000-fold weaker affinity compared to 3CLpro
(Table S1). Thereby, these data collectively support PF-00835231 is a selective in vitro protease
inhibitor with broad coronavirus activity.

In vitro cellular antiviral activity of PF-00835231 against SARS-CoV-2
The antiviral activity of PF-00835231 against SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture was evaluated with a
cytopathic effect (CPE) assay using either VeroE6 cells enriched for ACE2 (VeroE6-enACE2)
receptor or VeroE6 cells constitutively expressing EGFP (VeroE6-EGFP). These cell lines were
infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Washington strain 1 (WA1 - EPI_ISL_404895) or the BetaCoV
GHB-03021/2020 strain (GHB-03021 - EPI_ISL_407976) (19), respectively, which have
identical 3CLpro amino acid sequences. PF-00835231 exhibited viral CPE EC50 values of
39.7µM and 88.9µM, respectively (EC50, Fig. 2). However, Vero cells express high levels of the
efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (also known as MDR1 or ABCB1) (20), of which PF00835231 is a known substrate (15) suggesting that the intracellular concentration of PF00835231 was lower than the concentration added. Therefore, the assays were repeated in the
presence of a P-gp efflux inhibitor, CP-100356 (21). PF-00835231 exhibited a 117- to 173-fold
increase in activity in the presence of 2 µM P-gp inhibitor, with EC50 values of 0.23µM in
VeroE6–enACE2 cells and 0.76µM in the VeroE6-EGFP cells (Fig. 2). The P-gp inhibitor alone
had no antiviral or cytotoxic activity at these concentrations and did not cause cytotoxicity in the
presence the protease inhibitor. Consistent with many viral protease inhibitors (22), there was a
steep response to increasing doses of PF-00835231, with a ~2-3 fold difference between EC50
and EC90 in both cell types (EC90 = 0.48µM in VeroE6-enACE2 cells and EC90= 1.6µM in
VeroE6-EGFP cells in the presence of the P-gp inhibitor). When lung cell lines were tested for
antiviral potency in the presence and absence of P-gp inhibitor (A549-ACE2 (23) and MRC5),
no statistical difference in antiviral potency was observed (Fig. 2A). Additionally, antiviral
activities in both VeroE6 cell lines with 2µM P-gp inhibitor are similar to those observed in
more physiologically relevant human cell culture systems, including A549-ACE2 and polarized

human airway epithelial cells (23), where P-gp expression is lower. These data support the
potential for single agent antiviral activity.

Potential for antiviral combination benefit of PF-00835231 in combination with remdesivir
Combinations of antiviral agents, especially those targeting different steps in the virus replication
cycle, are a frequently employed therapeutic strategy in treating viral diseases (24). As PF00835231 and remdesivir, a nucleoside RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, target
different steps in the virus replication cycle, the antiviral activity of the two compounds was
evaluated alone and in combination using HeLa-ACE2 cells (25). Viral proteins were detected in
this assay using convalescent human polyclonal sera from two different COVID-19 patients. PF00835231 alone inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication with an average EC50 of 0.14µM and EC90 of
0.40µM; whereas remdesivir had an average EC50 of 0.074µM and EC90 of 0.17µM (Fig. 3A).
Combination studies were performed using a drug testing matrix, and the data for the drug
combination were analyzed using reference models (Loewe, Bliss, HSA) to classify the effects of
the drug combination as either additive, synergistic or antagonistic (isobologram, synergy scores,
and combination indices).

As summarized in Fig. 3B, the combination of PF-00835231 and remdesivir exhibited synergy
from patient #1 sera in 2 independent experiments and additivity in a single experiment with sera
from patient #2 (Fig. 3B). The different classification is most likely due to the different
convalescent serum used as detection reagents. These same antiviral data were also analysed
using Synergyfinder, which also indicated that the 2 drugs were additive to synergistic, with a
representative graph shown in Fig. 3B. Antagonism was not demonstrated for the combination of

PF-00835231 and remdesivir in these studies. The observed additivity/synergy was not due to
cytotoxicity, as there was no noticeable cytotoxicity in virus infected host cells for all the
combinations tested. This additivity/synergy is similar to other protease inhibitors used for the
treatment of HCV which has led to substantial clinical benefit (26).

Favorable preclinical ADME and pharmacokinetic profile of PF-00835231
The metabolic stability of PF-00835231 was evaluated in vitro using pooled human liver
microsomes (HLM). PF-00835231 was shown to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes
exhibiting an unbound CLint 14µl/min/mg. Using recombinant heterologously expressed enzymes
and HLM with the CYP3A selective inhibitor ketoconazole, CYP3A4 was identified as the major
CYP involved in the metabolism of PF-00835231. It was also noted that the polymorphically
expressed CYP3A5 can also metabolize PF-00835231 and that clearance may be slightly greater
in CYP3A5 expressers. The potential for PF-00835231 to reversibly inhibit human cytochrome
P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A) was evaluated using probe
substrates in pooled HLM and provided IC50 values >200 µM and a weak signal for time
dependent inhibition (TDI) of CYP3A4/5. These data indicate PF-00835231 provides a low risk
of causing drug-drug interactions (DDIs) on coadministration with other drugs. The potential for
PF-00835231 to inhibit a range of transporters (BCRP, P-gp, OATP1B1/1B3, OCT1/2, OAT1/3
and MATE1/2K) was evaluated using in vitro systems. The IC50 values were >20µM and
indicate a low risk of causing DDIs due to transporter inhibition at the projected clinical
exposure. The plasma protein binding of PF-00835231 was measured across species using
equilibrium dialysis and demonstrated moderate binding to plasma proteins with plasma free
fractions of 0.33 to 0.45 across species.

PF-00835231 was administered IV to rats, dogs and monkeys (1 or 2mg/kg) and exhibited
moderate plasma clearances (50-80% liver blood flow), low volumes of distribution (<1.5 L/kg)
and short half-lives (<2 hours) across species in keeping with its lipophilic (LogD7.4=1.7) and
neutral physicochemistry. Following oral administration to rats (2 mg/kg) and monkeys (5
mg/kg) PF-00835231 exhibited low oral bioavailability (<2%), likely due to a combination of
low absorption because of its low permeability (apparent MDCK-LE permeability of 1.3x106

cm/sec(27, 28), low solubility, potential for active efflux in the gut by P-gp and BCRP, and the

potential for amide hydrolysis by digestive enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract. In rat, dog and
monkey approximately 10% or less of PF-00835231 was eliminated unchanged in the urine
indicating renal elimination may also play a minor role in the clearance of PF-00835231 in
humans. Additional data presented in the supplementary data (Tables S1-S7).

Human pharmacokinetic predictions suitable for IV administration
Taking into account the human in vitro metabolism data and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) data
in rats, dogs and monkeys, PF-00835231 was predicted to exhibit a plasma clearance (CLp) of
~6mL/min/kg (major CYP, minor renal pathways), steady state volume of distribution (Vdss) of
1L/kg and half-life of approximately 2 hours in humans. Due to the limited oral bioavailability,
short elimination half-life, and the likely need to maintain free systemic concentrations over time
to achieve antiviral activity, a continuous IV infusion was proposed as the optimal dosing route
and regimen.

Efficacious target concentration and feasible human dose projection
The projected minimally efficacious concentration (Ceff) was chosen to match the in vitro EC90
(please see supplemental methods for rationale), consistent with the preclinical to clinical
translation of approved protease inhibitors (29). Since PF-00835231 was proposed to be
administered by continuous infusion, the projected steady-state exposure is equal to the Cmin
maintained over the dosing interval. The dose response assay performed in the most
physiologically relevant cell type, human lung carcinoma, resulted in an average EC90 value of
0.44µM (23). This is consistent with additional antiviral data in Hela-ACE2 cells (EC90=0.4µM)
and Vero cell lines (EC90= 0.48-1.6µM) when a P-gp inhibitor was added to better reflect the
lack of substantial P-gp transporter in the lung (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the antiviral inhibition is
supported by the antiviral time course experiment performed in a primary human airway
epithelial model (preliminary data indicates an unbound EC90 <0.5 µM) (23), indicating a
consistent intrinsic anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of PF-00835231 across different cell types.
Therefore, the proposed minimal Ceff is ~0.5µM.

Due to the rapid blood perfusion through the lungs and the continuous steady state intravenous
infusion regimen, the free plasma and free lung concentrations are assumed to be in equilibrium
and, therefore, the free plasma concentration provides a reasonable surrogate for the
concentration at the main site of action of the disease. Based on the human PK predictions, the
minimally efficacious dose of PF-00835231 necessary to achieve this exposure is ~320 mg/day
administered as an intravenous continuous infusion. The required duration of dosing for efficacy
remains uncertain and will need to be evaluated in humans. Based on clinical results from

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.12.293498; this version posted September 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

remdesivir a duration of up to 10 days of dosing may be required to provide improved patient
outcomes (5).

Formulation and solubility profile of PF-00835231 to enable IV administration
PF-00835231 is a moderately lipophilic (LogD7.4 = 1.7), neutral molecule with no ionizable
centers throughout the physiologically relevant pH range. Consequently, PF-00835231 exhibits
a pH independent solubility with an intrinsic aqueous solubility of less than 0.1mg/mL and
limited opportunities for solubility-enabling formulation approaches. Preliminary work using
standard solubilizing excipients indicated that achieving a solubility >0.5mg/mL would likely be
challenging.

Based on a maximum desired intravenous infusion volume of ~1L per day a solubility of
0.5mg/mL would be sufficient to deliver the minimal efficacious dose estimate of ~320 mg/day
to maintain a ~0.5µM steady state unbound concentration (Fig. 4B). Due to the nascent
understanding of the virus and the current lack of in vivo data to aid clinical translation, the
required target levels of inhibition for clinical benefit remain uncertain and the ability to evaluate
exposures up to ~10x Ceff in early clinical development is desirable. As a potential option to
increase exposures, and/or decrease the required infusion volume, the use of a strong CYP3A
inhibitor (itraconazole 200mg QD for 15 days) was considered but preliminary, physiologicallybased pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling predicted only a ~2-fold increase in PF-00835231
exposure at steady state (supplemental Table S10).

The ability to achieve higher doses could also potentially mitigate a higher than predicted
clearance, or variations in patient body weight. Therefore, a medicinal chemistry strategy to
significantly enhance the aqueous solubility of PF-00835231, by designing a phosphate prodrug
was pursued.

Considering an intravenous phosphate prodrug approach to improve solubility
IV phosphate prodrugs have precedence with several commercially available drugs such as
fosfluconazole and fosphenytoin which are rapidly cleaved by human alkaline phosphatase to
provide high systemic exposures of their respective active moieties following IV administration
(Fig. 4) (30, 31). Alkaline phosphatase is ubiquitously expressed across tissues with high levels
expressed in the liver, lung, and kidney (ALPL tissue data from v19.proteinatlas.org (32)). High
levels of conversion from prodrug to active moiety for fosfluconazole and fosphenytoin have
also been observed in rats and dogs supporting cross species translation to human for the
conversion of prodrug to active moiety (31, 33). Overall, the use of a phosphate prodrug is an
established approach for IV administration to provide rapid conversion to its active moiety and
was considered for PF-00835231.

Synthetic route to provide phosphate prodrug
The synthesis of PF-00835231 has been described previously (15). The subsequent synthesis of
the phosphate prodrug of PF-00835231 was achieved via two steps (Fig. S1). Briefly, treatment
of 1 (PF-00835231) with di-tert-butyl N,N-dipropan-2-ylphosphoramidite and tetrazole in
tetrahydrofuran followed by oxidation with aqueous hydrogen peroxide delivered intermediate 2.

The phosphate t-butyl groups were subsequently hydrolyzed using trifluoroacetic acid in
dichloromethane to deliver phosphate prodrug 3 (PF-07304814) as a solid.

Enhanced formulation and solubility profile of PF-07304814 to provide clinical flexibility
PF-07304814 rapidly undergoes in vivo conversion to the active metabolite PF-00835231 (Fig.
3A). The phosphate prodrug is weakly acidic, with pKas of 1 and 6.4, and a predicted LogD7.4 of
-3.7. At pHs above the compound's first pKa, the phosphate functional group is de-protonated
and negatively charged, which enables a significant improvement in aqueous solubility to greater
than 200mg/mL over a pH range compatible with intravenous infusion. The higher intrinsic
solubility of PF-07304814 eliminates the need for solubility-enabling formulations and enables
the use of standard IV compatible excipients. Furthermore, the improved solubility enables
higher doses to be explored in the clinic and gives clinicians greater flexibility in terms of dose
volume to account for patient-specific co-administration requirements.

PF-07304814 (prodrug) preclinical in vitro and in vivo ADME profile
To understand the metabolic stability and conversion of PF-07304814 to its active moiety (PF00835231), PF-07304814 enzyme kinetics were evaluated in vitro using liver S9 fractions and
was shown to exhibit rapid conversion to PF-00835231 with unbound CLint values of 51, 84, 168
and 428µl/min/mg in rat, dog, monkey and human respectively. In these in vitro systems, PF00835231 was the only metabolite formed from PF-07304814. Conversion was rapid in
phosphate-free incubations but abolished in the presence of phosphate buffer supporting the role
of alkaline phosphatase in this conversion (Table S8, Fig. S2). To evaluate the in vivo conversion

and systemic availability of the active moiety PF-00835231, PF-07304814 was administered
intravenously to rats, dogs and monkeys. PF-07304814 exhibited high systemic clearance and
short half-life across species forming 68, 81, 76% PF-00835231 in rats, dogs and monkey
respectively in comparison to the systemic exposure achieved with IV administration of PF00835231 (Fig. 5A).

PF-07304814 was also evaluated for the potential to cause reversible and time dependent
inhibition of human cytochrome P450 enzymes using pooled HLM and probe substrates for a
range of CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5) and showed low risk with
IC50 values >100µM and no evidence of TDI. The potential for PF-07304814 to inhibit a range of
transporters (BCRP, P-gp, OATP1B1/1B3, OCT1/2, OAT1/3 and MATE1/2K) was evaluated
using in vitro systems providing IC50 values >130µM indicating a low risk of causing DDIs due
to transporter inhibition at the projected Ceff. The plasma protein binding of PF-07304814 was
measured across species using equilibrium dialysis showing moderate binding to plasma proteins
with plasma free fractions of 0.18 to 0.38 across species. Additional data presented in the
supplementary data (Tables S3, S5-S7).

Encouraging human PK predictions for PF-00835231 formation
The predicted human plasma clearance of PF-07304814 is ~10mL/min/kg based on scaling in
vitro human liver S9 CLint data (using equations 9 and 10, see Methods) and represents a
conservative prediction of total Clp as it only accounts for conversion of prodrug to active moiety
in the liver. The human Vdss for PF-07304814 is predicted to be ~0.1L/kg based on its acidic
physiochemistry and observed human Vdss values of other phosphate prodrugs (30, 31). Based

on the predicted Clp, Vdss, and a ~75% conversion to PF-00835231 based on the mean
conversion in animals, PF-07304814 is anticipated to exhibit a short half-life of ~0.1hour with
high conversion to the active moiety (Fig. 5B).

PF-07304814 unlikely to contribute to antiviral activity in vivo
In a direct comparison, using the same SARS-Cov-2 3CLpro assay method as described in (15),
the prodrug PF-07304814 binds and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity with a Ki of 174nM
providing a >600-fold higher Ki in comparison to the active moiety PF-00835231 (0.27nM)
(15). However, PF-07304814 shows similar antiviral activity to PF-00835231 (1-12-fold, Fig.
2A) across cellular in vitro assays, most likely due to the partial conversion of PF-07304814 to
PF-00835231 in the cellular assays by alkaline phosphatase. This was consistent with PF00835231 concentrations measured at approximately 50% of the PF-07304814 starting
concentration at the end of the 3-day incubation in the VeroE6 cell assay.

PF-07304814 dose projection provides clinical flexibility to achieve target Ceff
The antiviral activity for PF-00835231 was used to derive the minimal Ceff and dose estimates.
Based on the predicted human PK and 75% conversion of the prodrug, a free plasma
concentration of the active moiety PF-00835231 of 0.5µM (Ceff) can be achieved with a 500 mg
continuous IV infusion of the prodrug over 24 hours (Fig. 5C). The estimated time to achieve
90% steady state exposure of PF-00835231 is approximately 6 hours. Due to the improved
solubility (>200mg/mL), the dose of PF-0730814 can be delivered in a volume of less than
0.25L. In addition the dose can be increased if the observed human plasma Cl exceeds

6mL/min/kg, if the percent converted from prodrug to active is less than predicted, or if
exposures in excess of the minimal Ceff (0.5µM) are required to maximize clinical activity (Fig.
4B). Overall the improved solubility would theoretically enable >100-fold the proposed minimal
Ceff dose in a 0.25L dose volume.

Preclinical safety profile supports progression to clinical evaluation
A toxicology assessment consisting of an in vitro battery of genetic toxicity, secondary and
safety pharmacology studies, in conjunction with a single species (rat) in vivo Good Laboratory
Practice (GLP) study has been completed. Data from repeat dose toxicology studies in rodent
and non-rodent are planned or currently underway.

The safety profiles of PF-07304814 and PF-00835231 were assessed individually in a range of in
vitro and in vivo safety studies in rats. In the in vitro studies, PF-07304814 and PF-00835231
were negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay and did not induce micronuclei formation.
Both compounds had minimal potential for secondary (off-target) pharmacology at clinically
relevant exposures. Neither PF-07304814 nor PF-00835231 inhibited hERG current amplitude at
up to 300µM (1,770- and 600-fold, respectively, in reference to the projected unbound human
Cmax of 0.17 and 0.50µM, respectively, at the projected human efficacious dose), indicating a
favorable cardiovascular safety profile. In human blood hemocompatibility assays, both
compounds had no effect on hemolysis or flocculation/turbidity parameters, indicating
compatibility with human blood and supporting intravenous administration.

PF-07304814 was administered to rats via continuous IV infusion for 24 hours in a GLP study.
There were no test article related findings and no target organ toxicity was identified. PF07304814 had no effects on neurological safety pharmacology parameters as assessed by
functional observation battery in the 24-hour continuous IV infusion rat study. The no observed
adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 1000mg/kg. PF-00835231 was also administered to male rats
via continuous IV infusion for 4 days in a non-GLP exploratory toxicity study and was tolerated
at 246mg/kg/day, the highest feasible dose tested. PF-00835231-related findings in this study
were limited to minimal, non-adverse effects on clinical chemistry parameters including higher
mean triglycerides (1.9-3.6x vs controls), cholesterol (1.3x), and phosphorus (1.1x) without any
microscopic correlates or associated functional changes. No test article related adverse effects
were seen in any study.

At the NOAEL from the 24-hour, GLP continuous IV infusion study with PF-07304814 in rats,
the anticipated exposure margins for unbound Cmax and AUC24 are 97 and 65-fold for PF07304814 and 25 and 21-fold for PF-00835231, at the projected minimum human efficacious
dose of 500mg/day. This indicates the potential to safely evaluate multiples over EC90 in humans
during clinical testing to understand the exposure response relationship and to achieve high
levels of inhibition, if required. Furthermore, no overlapping or additive toxicity with
medications currently being used in standard of care COVID-19 treatment is expected with
administration of PF-07304814 in humans, making PF-07304814 an attractive combination
partner. Based on results from the set of safety studies conducted, PF-07304814 exhibited an
encouraging nonclinical safety profile and supported progression into Phase 1 clinical studies.

Conclusions
PF-07304814 is a phosphate prodrug that is rapidly converted in vivo to the active moiety, PF00835231, which exhibits high selectivity over human proteases and acts as a broad-spectrum
coronavirus 3CL protease inhibitor. Robust antiviral activity was demonstrated in a range of
cellular in vitro assays in keeping with SARS-COV-2 human airway epithelial data (23)
suggesting a Ceff value of ~0.5µM. The predicted human pharmacokinetics of PF-07304814
provide the ability to achieve systemic unbound concentrations of 0.5µM (EC90) of PF-00835231
by delivering 500mg as a continuous infusion over 24 hours with infusion volumes of less than
0.25L. In addition, higher doses (up to and beyond 10x Ceff) also remain feasible if needed due to
the high solubility of PF-07304814.

Overall, PF-07304814 exhibits an encouraging preclinical profile that has the SARS-CoV-2
antiviral activity, ADME, and safety profile that supports progression to the clinic as a potential
novel COVID-19 single agent antiviral treatment, with potential for further additional benefit in
combination with antivirals that target other critical stages of the coronavirus life cycle. The
favorable profile of PF-07304814 warrants clinical evaluation.
