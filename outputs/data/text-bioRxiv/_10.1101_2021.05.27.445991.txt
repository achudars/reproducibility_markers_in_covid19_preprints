Abstract
A hallmark of COVID-19 is a hyperinflammatory state that is associated with severity. Various antiinflammatory therapeutics have shown mixed efficacy in treating COVID-19, and the mechanisms by
which hyperinflammation occurs are not well understood. Previous research indicated that monocytes,
a key innate immune cell, undergo metabolic reprogramming and produce inflammatory cytokines when
stimulated with SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that binding by the viral spike protein mediates this
effect, and that drugs which regulate immunometabolism could inhibit the inflammatory response in
monocytes. Monocytes stimulated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 showed a
dose-dependent increase in glycolytic metabolism that was associated with production of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α. This response was
dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, as chetomin inhibited glycolysis and cytokine production.
Inhibition of glycolytic metabolism by 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) or glucose deprivation also inhibited the
glycolytic response, and 2-DG strongly suppressed cytokine production. Glucose-deprived monocytes
rescued cytokine production by upregulating oxidative phosphorylation, an effect which was not present
in 2-DG-treated monocytes due to the known effect of 2-DG on suppressing mitochondrial metabolism.
Finally, pre-treatment of monocytes with metformin strongly suppressed spike protein-mediated
cytokine production in monocytes, and abrogated glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism. Likewise,
metformin pre-treatment blocked cytokine induction by SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020 in direct infection
experiments in monocytes. In summary, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces a pro-inflammatory
immunometabolic response in monocytes that can be suppressed by metformin, and metformin
likewise suppresses inflammatory responses to live SARS-CoV-2. This has potential implications for the
treatment of hyperinflammation during COVID-19.

Introduction
The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has presently more than 3 million
lives worldwide as of mid-April 2021 1. COVID-19 is caused by a novel highly pathogenic coronavirus
classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) 2. A hallmark of severe
COVID-19 is hyperinflammation 3, although cytokine expression patterns in individuals are diverse,
leading to controversy over classification of COVID-19 related inflammation as cytokine storm,
macrophage activation syndrome, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, etc. Regardless, inflammatory
cytokines appear to play a principal role in mediating COVID-19 symptoms, therefore therapies which
target these responses are paramount to treating severe COVID-19. As such, a fuller understanding of
the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating hypercytokinemia during SARS-CoV-2 infection is
necessary.
Mononuclear phagocytes such as monocytes and macrophages are key constituents of the
innate immune system, and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines during viral infection 4–7. Monocyte
and monocyte-derived macrophage infiltration into the lungs has been linked to severe COVID-19 in
single cell RNA sequencing studies 8–11 and postmortem analyses 12–15 in human patients, as well as
during experimental infections in animal models including mice 16,17, hamsters 18, and various nonhuman primates 19–23. Monocytes in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 display phenotypic changes
associated with hyperinflammation, including reduced HLA-DR expression 24–26, increased CD16
expression 25,27–29, and increased cytokine production 30–33. Both monocytes 34–36 and monocyte-derived
macrophages 37,38 also produce pro-inflammatory cytokines under direct infection with SARS-CoV-2,
although infection at least in macrophages appears to be abortive 37,38.
The past decade has seen an explosion in scientific interest in the regulation of immune cell
activation and function by metabolic reprogramming. Under pro-inflammatory conditions, immune cells
– including myeloid cells – generally undergo a switch to aerobic glycolysis which provides ATP sufficient

to support cellular functions which propagate pro-inflammatory and anti-pathogen host responses 39.
Recently, Codo et al. demonstrated pro-inflammatory glycolytic reprogramming in monocytes infected
with SARS-CoV-2 34, and SARS-CoV-2 also appears to alter monocyte lipid metabolism to promote lipid
droplet formation which is associated with pro-inflammatory cytokine production 35.
SARS-CoV-2 therefore appears to reprogram metabolism in monocytes, but the viral factors
which mediate these responses are unclear. Research in the 2003 epidemic SARS-CoV-1 suggested that
the viral spike protein could mediate pro-inflammatory activation in macrophages 40,41, and recent
evidence suggests the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 also activates inflammatory responses in
macrophages and monocytes both in vitro and in vivo 42,43. Given this, we hypothesized that spike
protein binding to monocytes mediates glycolytic reprogramming to promote pro-inflammatory
responses of these cells to SARS-CoV-2. Our results herein support this hypothesis, and we additionally
report outcomes from experiments aimed at evaluating the responsible cellular signaling mechanisms,
as well as potential pharmaceutical strategies for inhibiting these responses.

Results
Spike protein subunit 1 reprograms metabolism and promotes inflammatory responses
Recently it was demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 promotes metabolic reprogramming in
monocytes during infection 34,35. Research in SARS-CoV suggested that the viral spike protein induces
inflammatory responses in macrophages 40,41, and this has recently been replicated using spike protein
from SARS-CoV-2 42,43. Likewise, spike protein binding to C-type lectins has recently been shown to
mediate pro-inflammatory processes in myeloid cells 44,45. Therefore, we hypothesized that the SARSCoV-2 spike protein mediates a pro-inflammatory metabolic reprogramming in monocytes which could
be a basis for hypercytokinemia. Stimulation of isolated human classical monocytes with recombinant
spike protein subunit 1 (S1) from SARS-CoV-2 induced glycolytic activation (Figure 1A) and suppressed

oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS, Figure 1C) in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of S1 dose was
significant for both extracellular acidification rate (F2,14=72.44, p<0.0001, Figure 1B) and oxygen
consumption rate (F2,14=5.785, p=0.0147, Figure 1D) as measured by quantification of area under the
response curve.
Additionally, recombinant S1 treatment caused a dose-dependent increase transcription of proinflammatory cytokines (Figure 1E) including IL1B (F2,14=50.98, p<0.001), IL6 (Friedman χ2 (df=2)=16,
p<0.001), CXCL8 (F2,14=38.19, p<0.001), and TNF (F2,14=28.41, p<0.001) as measured by qPCR. These
cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and in COVID-19-related
hypercytokinemia in several studies 25,46–51. To confirm that increased transcription resulted in increased
protein expression, we evaluated protein concentrations of key cytokines in the supernatant of S1stimulated monocytes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Figure 1F). S1 increased protein
expression of interleukin (IL)-6 (Friedman χ2 (df=2)=16, p<0.001) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α
(F2,14=37.73, p<0.001) in a dose-dependent manner.

Glycolytic response to spike protein is dependent on HIF-1α
Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α was demonstrated nearly 20 years ago to mediate proinflammatory responses in myeloid cells 52, and has more recently been shown to regulate glycolytic
activation in monocytes, macrophages, and other immune cells 53–55. SARS-CoV-2 activates HIF-1αmediated glycolysis in monocytes 34, so we reasoned that this was a likely downstream mechanism by
which the viral spike protein causes this similar glycolytic reprogramming in our experiments. As above,
treatment of monocytes with S1 activated glycolysis, and this effect was abrogated by pre-treatment
with chetomin (Figure 2A/B, F2,12=42.43, p<0.001), which disrupts the interaction between HIF-1α and
p300 to block the effects of the former 56. Pre-treatment with chetomin also strongly suppressed the
cytokine response due to S1 treatment (Figure 2C), including blunting transcription of IL1B (F2,12=27.35,
p<0.001), IL6 (F2,12=16.11, p<0.001), CXCL8 (F2,12=25.54, p<0.001), and TNF (F2,12=29.04, p<0.001). As

such, HIF-1α appears to be a master regulator of both glycolytic reprogramming and inflammatory
activation of monocytes under S1 stimulation.

Suppression of glycolysis alters inflammatory responses to spike protein
To determine whether metabolic reprogramming is responsible for altered cytokine responses
to S1, we suppressed glycolytic responses during S1 treatment using 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG)
pretreatment. Treatment of monocytes with 2-DG ablated monocyte glycolytic responses to S1
stimulation (Figure 3A) which was significant by comparison of area under the response curve (t6=10.867, p<0.0001, Figure 3B). However, 2-DG also suppressed mitochondrial function in these cells
(Figure 2C), though this was non-significant by area under the oxygen consumption (t6=-2.2284,
p=0.0674, Figure 3D). This effect has been noted previously during responses to LPS 57. Anticipating this,
we also included a condition where monocytes were cultured under glucose deprivation, as a second
method of suppressing glycolytic activation. We noted a similar ablation of glycolytic responses to S1
using this strategy (Figure 3A) which was significant by area under the curve analysis (t6=-14.045,
p<0.0001, Figure 3B). However, glucose deprivation caused an increase in oxygen consumption after S1
treatment (Figure 3C) which was significant compared to media- (t6=4.6618, p=0.0069) or 2-DG (t6=15.607, p<0.001) pretreated monocytes (Figure 3D).
Pre-treatment of monocytes with 2-DG also strongly inhibited cytokine expression compared to
cells treated with S1(Figure 3E), including transcription of IL1B (W=0, p=0.0313), IL6 (t6=-5.912,
p=0.0021), CXCL8 (W=0, p=0.0313), and TNF (W=0, p=0.0313). However, glucose deprived monocytes
generally maintained their ability to transcribe pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to S1, with only
IL1B expression showing a modest 25.1% reduction in glucose deprived compared to S1-treated
monocytes (Figure 3E, W=0, p=0.0313). Monocytes appear to utilize fatty acid oxidation to compensate
for loss of glycolysis during cytokine responses as has been previously demonstrated with LPS 57–60, and

therefore the 2-DG-mediated suppression of S1-induced inflammation is likely due to its ability to
suppress both glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism in concert.

AMPK controls the OXPHOS response to spike protein in the absence of glucose
Activation of OXPHOS appeared to compensate for loss of glycolysis under glucose deprivation
conditions in S1-treated monocytes. Therefore, we examined the potential role of AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) in mediating this response. Compound C (dorsomorphin) is a selective inhibitor of
AMPK 61, therefore we examined whether compound C would block OXPHOS activation by S1 in glucose
deprived monocytes. Pre-treatment with compound C slightly reduced ECAR in glucose deprived
monocytes compared to media-treated glucose deprived monocytes (Figure 4A/B), although this small
effect is likely not biologically important. Compound C pre-treatment inhibited the OXPHOS response to
S1 during glucose deprivation, but compound C-treated monocytes did not demonstrate suppressed
OXPHOS as compared to S1-stimulated monocytes treated in the presence of glucose (Figure 4C/D,
F2,12=25.81, p<0.001). Interestingly, compound C pre-treatment had a variable effect on cytokine gene
expression, with only TNF expression significantly suppressed in glucose deprived monocytes treated
with compound C compared to media (Figure 4E, Friedman χ2 (df=2)=10.571, p=0.005). Expression of IL1B,
IL6, and CXCL8 were not significantly altered by compound C treatment, although CXCL8 showed a trend
toward increased expression in glucose deprived monocytes treated with compound C compared to
media (p=0.0603).

Metformin abrogates inflammatory response to spike protein
The small molecule compounds chetomin and 2-deoxyglucose inhibited immunometabolic
activation in monocytes, suggesting a potential strategy for treating hypercytokinemia during COVID-19.
However, chetomin is not approved for use in humans, although it has shown efficacy in vivo in animal
models 56. Additionally, 2-DG has poor efficacy in humans due to rapid metabolism and limited
bioavailability 62. Therefore, we investigated the ability of the common diabetes and geroprotector drug

metformin to inhibit cytokine production in S1-stimulated monocytes. Metformin activates AMPK 61 and
(independently of AMPK) opposes the action of HIF-1α 63,64, and additionally inhibits mitochondrial
metabolism through blocking complex I of the electron transport chain 65,66, thus we hypothesized that it
would have a qualitatively similar effect to 2-DG in inhibiting cytokine production through dual inhibition
of glycolysis and OXPHOS.
Pre-treatment with metformin abrogated the glycolytic response to S1 in monocytes (Figure
5A/B, F2,12=60.05, p<0.001) and strongly inhibited cellular respiration (Figure 5C/D, Friedman χ2
(df=2)=12.286,

p=0.0021) in Seahorse assays. Likewise, metformin pre-treatment suppressed cytokine

responses to S1 treatment in monocytes (Figure 5E), including IL1B (Friedman χ2 (df=2)=12.286, p=0.0021),
IL6 (Friedman χ2 (df=2)=10.571, p=0.0051), CXCL8 (F2,12=68.18, p<0.0001), and TNF (Friedman χ2
(df=2)=12.286,

p=0.0021).

Metformin abrogates IL-6 production in virus-stimulated monocytes
Recent evidence suggests that myeloid cells recognize SARS-CoV-2 spike protein through C-type
lectins 44,45. However, the SARS-CoV-2 virion also contains additional immunoregulatory and proinflammatory proteins 67,68, therefore we examined the ability of metformin to block cytokine responses
to live SARS-CoV-2. Monocytes treated for 24 hr with SARS-CoV-2 increased expression of IL-6 protein,
and this was suppressed by metformin pre-treatment (Figure 6, F2,14=11.48, p=0.0011), suggesting that
the anti-inflammatory effect of metformin is not specific to spike protein-stimulated cytokine responses
in monocytes.

Discussion
The present study resulted in several advances of major importance for the understanding of
SARS-CoV-2 innate immune responses. First, we report here that monocytes treated with recombinant
spike protein subunit 1 from the current pandemic SARS-CoV-2 undergo a dose-dependent increase in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.27.445991; this version posted May 28, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

glycolysis which is controlled by HIF-1α and mediates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
These data suggest an initial signaling event which precipitates changes in glucose and lipid metabolism
during SARS-CoV-2 infection in monocytes which have been previously reported to be linked to
inflammatory activation 34,35. Monocyte and monocyte-derived macrophages are substantially enriched
in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with severe COVID-19 8,9,12–15 and respond to
experimental viral infection by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines 34–38, therefore these results
reflect a potential mechanism by which hypercytokinemia occurs during the early innate immune
response to SARS-CoV-2.
Importantly, the available evidence suggests that infection of monocytes/macrophages by SARSCoV-2 is abortive 37,38,69, thus recognition of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins or genomic material is the
likely mechanism by which direct infection precipitates inflammatory responses in this cell type. Our
data suggest the spike protein is one such determinant, although we cannot conclude it is the only such
mechanism given that recent reports have demonstrated inflammatory responses in macrophages
treated with the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein 67. It is also possible, however, that direct viral binding to
monocytes is not the only way in which these cells can be exposed to the viral spike protein. Recent
evidence suggests that vaccine antigens including S1 are released into the circulation following
vaccination 70, and this represents a potential pro-inflammatory stimulus for monocytes.
Monocyte/macrophage recognition of S1 may also contribute to the local (muscle) inflammatory
response during vaccination. Additionally, the viral spike protein undergoes cleavage by furin during
binding to ACE2 71, and it has been suggested that this could lead to release of the S1 subunit 72,
although to date this is speculative.
ACE2 has limited expression on immune cells including monocytes and macrophages 73, which
has called into question whether they can directly recognize SARS-CoV-2. In this study we did not
identify the mechanism for monocyte recognition of S1, but several recent papers have shed light on

this. Two reports recently demonstrated spike binding to C-type lectin receptors 44,45 which mediates
pro-inflammatory signaling in myeloid cells. Likewise, monocytes and macrophages express high levels
of CD147 73, and this receptor has been shown to recognize spike protein and contribute to activation of
T cells 74. Monocytes therefore have multiple methods of recognizing S1, and the receptor(s) responsible
for signaling to induce immunometabolic activation deserve further investigation.
The second major advance in this study is the identification of metformin as a potential
immunometabolic regulator of inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2. Small molecule inhibitors of HIF1α (chetomin) and glucose metabolism (2-deoxyglucose) blocked cytokine production in S1-treated
monocytes, suggesting that interfering with downstream signaling pathways activated by spike protein
binding is a potential therapeutic strategy to target inflammation during COVID-19. As these compounds
are not approved for human use or have low efficacy in humans as described above, we evaluated the
ability of metformin to suppress glycolytic reprogramming and cytokine production in S1-stimulated
monocytes. Metformin reduced cytokine production and strongly inhibited both glycolysis and cellular
respiration in culture, suggesting it as a potential treatment for hyperinflammation during COVID-19.
Further, metformin blocked IL-6 production in monocytes infected with live SARS-CoV-2, suggesting this
effect is not limited to artificial stimulation conditions with purified recombinant protein.
Metformin is extremely inexpensive compared to many pharmaceuticals, with an estimated
manufacturing cost under 10 USD per kg for the active ingredient 75 and a monthly wholesale cost as low
as 25 USD 76. Metformin has been previously noted as a treatment for non-COVID acute respiratory
distress syndrome 77 and is a potent suppressor of immune activation of monocytes and macrophages
by other molecules including LPS 78–80. Additionally, several epidemiological studies have noted
decreased mortality 81–85 and inflammation 86,87 in COVID-19 patients who were taking metformin prior
to diagnosis. Therefore, given these observations and its low cost, excellent safety profile, wide
availability, and efficacy in inhibiting inflammatory responses to S1 in vitro, metformin is a promising

candidate for further exploration as a COVID-19 therapeutic. Our study is limited to a single in vitro
measure of metformin as a therapeutic for COVID-19, so a great deal of further study is necessary in
order to establish this drug as a viable treatment.
Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrate here that the spike protein subunit 1 from SARS-CoV-2 causes
activation of HIF-1α dependent glycolysis and inflammatory cytokine production in monocytes which
can be suppressed by treatment with the diabetes drug metformin. These experiments detail a
mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 mediates metabolic reprogramming previously described in human
monocytes, and additionally provides a potential mechanism for the observation that metformin is
protective against mortality in COVID-19 patients. Continued research in this area has the potential to
define therapeutic strategies and additional molecular targets for the treatment of COVID-19-associated
hyperinflammation.

Methods
Subjects
Healthy 18–35-year-old subjects (N=14) were recruited without respect to sex or race.
Participants reported to the laboratory approximately every two weeks for blood collection, and 8-24 ml
blood was collected into EDTA-treated vacutainer tubes by venipuncture. Blood was immediately used
for cell isolations as described below. All human subjects activities were approved by the Institutional
Review Board at the University of Memphis under protocol 4316, and subjects provided informed
consent prior to enrollment.

Cell isolations
Assays were performed on purified human classical monocytes isolated using immunomagnetic
negative sorting (EasySep Direct Human Monocyte Isolation Kit, StemCell Technologies, Cambridge,

MA). As we have previously described 88, this procedure results in a highly pure (> 85%) population of
classical monocytes, with depletion of intermediate and non-classical monocytes due to the presence of
an anti-CD16 antibody in the cocktail. Isolation purity was verified at several points throughout the
current study and averaged approximately 90% (not shown). Cells were counted at 10× dilution using a
Scepter cell counter (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Isolated monocytes were immediately utilized in
downstream assays, and no cells were frozen for later use.

Media and reagents
Unless otherwise specified, all assays were performed using Seahorse XF base DMEM medium
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) supplemented with 10 mM glucose and 2 mM L-glutamine (Millipore Sigma, St.
Louis, MO). Assays utilizing glucose deprivation omitted glucose from the media preparation. Media was
not supplemented with fetal bovine serum or other additives. Recombinant spike protein subunit 1 (S1)
was purchased from RayBiotech (Peachtree Corners, GA). 2-deoxyglucose, chetomin, compound C, and
metformin were purchased from Millipore Sigma (St. Louis, MO). SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 strain was
provided by Dr. Colleen Jonsson, Regional Biocontainment Laboratory, University of Tennessee Health
Science Center.

Seahorse extracellular flux
Glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation were respectively quantified via kinetic monitoring of
extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) on a Seahorse XFp analyzer
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). For all assays, monocytes were plated at 1.5×105 cells per well, and wells A
and H of the XFp plate were background wells with no cells. All analyses were run in duplicate. Plated
cells were incubated at 37oC in a non-CO2 incubator for 1 hour prior to assays to stabilize pH. All wells
were imaged at 10× magnification for cell counting in order to adjust raw measurements for cell
number.

For quantification of dose response to S1, 5 basal measurements were made, followed by
injection of media (wells B-C), 100 nM spike protein (wells D-E), or 300 nM spike protein (wells F-G).
After injection into existing media in the well, spike protein concentrations were 10-fold lower than
injection concentrations, thereby giving final spike protein concentrations of 0 nM, 10 nM, or 30 nM.
Following injection, ECAR and OCR were monitored serially for 60 measurements. Following the assay,
cell culture supernatants were removed, pooled by duplicate, and stored at -80oC. Cells were then lysed
with 100 μl Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), pooled by duplicate, and stored at -80oC as
we have previously described 89.
For chetomin and metformin Seahorse assays, cells were incubated in media as above (wells BE), or either 10 nM chetomin or 50 mM metformin during the 1-hour pre-incubation period (wells F-G).
5 basal ECAR/OCR measurements were performed, followed by injection of media (wells B-C) or 300 nM
spike protein (wells D-G) for a final concentration of 0 nM (wells B-C) or 30 nM spike protein (wells D-G)
as above. Following injection, ECAR and OCR were monitored serially for 30 measurements. Cell culture
supernatants and Trizol lysates were processed as described above following the end of the assay.
For glycolysis inhibition assays, cells were incubated in media, 10 mM 2-deoxyglucose, or media
without glucose (glucose deprivation) during the 1-hour pre-incubation period. 5 basal ECAR/OCR
measurements were performed, followed by injection of 300 nM spike protein to all wells for a final
concentration of 30 nM spike protein per well as above. Spike protein was prepared in non-glucose
media for the glucose deprivation condition. Following injection, ECAR and OCR were monitored serially
for 30 measurements. Cell culture supernatants and Trizol lysates were processed as described above
following the end of the assay.
For glycolysis inhibition with compound C assays, cells were incubated in media, glucose
deprivation media, or glucose deprivation media plus 10 μM compound C during the 1-hour preincubation period. 5 basal ECAR/OCR measurements were performed, followed by injection of 300 nM

SARS-CoV-2 infections
Isolated monocytes were incubated in RPMI-1640 media (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), with or without 50 mM metformin,
for 1-hour. Cells were then treated with media or infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus (WA1/2020 isolate) at
0.5 MOI and incubated for 24 hours. Cell culture supernatants were collected from untreated and
infected cells and stored at -80oC until analysis.

Gene and protein expression analysis
RNA isolation was performed using the Trizol procedure based on manufacturer’s instructions
from cells lysed directly in the microplate or Seahorse plate wells as applicable. Isolated RNA (300-400
ng depending on experiment) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Gene expression was analyzed using
commercial pre-validated gene expression assays and Taqman reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA). Relative gene expression was quantified using the 2-ΔΔCt method 90 against B2M or ACTB
as housekeeping genes. Primer/probe IDs were: B2M Hs00187842_m1; ACTB Hs03023943_g1; IL1B
Hs01555410_m1; IL6 Hs00174131_m1; CXCL8 Hs00174103_m1; TNF Hs00174128_m1.
For protein quantification, cell culture supernatants harvested from microplates or Seahorse
XFp plates were analyzed via ELISA. Commercial DuoSet matched-antibody reagent sets were purchased
from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) for quantifying human IL-6 and human TNFα and used according
to manufacturer’s instructions. All samples were run in duplicate at 5× dilution (SARS-CoV-2 assays) or
50× dilution (Seahorse S1 dose response assays) and assessed against a standard curve.

Protein concentration of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and C-reactive protein (CRP)
was performed by ELISA on plasma samples collected by venipuncture from subjects at the beginning of
the study. Peripheral blood was collected by venipuncture into EDTA-coated vacutainer tubes,
centrifuged at 1,500×g for 15 min, aliquoted, and stored at -80oC until analysis. Plasma samples were
analyzed in duplicate at 10× (ACE2) or 10,000× (CRP) using commercial DuoSet matched-antibody
reagent kits (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer’s instructions and assessed against a standard
curve.
Data Processing and Statistical Analysis
All data processing and statistical analyses were performed using R v. 3.6.2 91. Isolated
monocytes from each subject were given all treatments for each experiment, so data were paired and
analyzed using within-subjects designs. Data were checked for normality by Shapiro-Wilk test and
analyzed by one-way repeated measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA, for data which met the normality
assumption) or Friedman’s test (for data which did not meet the normality assumption). For analyses
with significant main effects, post hoc mean separation was performed using pairwise paired T tests (for
RM-ANOVA) or pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (for Friedman’s tests) with p-value adjustment using
the Holm-Bonferroni method 92. Significance cutoff was p<0.05.

Figure 1. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 (rS1) mediates immunometabolic activation
of monocytes. (A) Monocytes increase extracellular acidification response rate (ECAR) in a dosedependent manner when treated with rS1. (B) Quantification of ECAR by area under the curve (AUC). (C)
rS1 treatment suppresses oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in monocytes in a dose-dependent fashion.
(D) Quantification of OCR by AUC. (E) Gene expression analysis by qPCR reveals dose-dependent
increases in responses of IL1B, IL6, CXCL8, and TNF to rS1 stimulation. (F) Protein expression analysis by
ELISA reveals dose-dependent increases in responses of IL-6 and TNFα to rS1 stimulation. ECAR and OCR
data in panels A-D are adjusted for values indexed to 1×105 cells/well. *, **, ***: p<0.05, p<0.01,
p<0.001 vs. 0 nM rS1. †, ††, †††: p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.001 vs. 10 nM rS1. N=8 biological replicates.

Figure 2. HIF-1α inhibition suppresses immunometabolic activation of monocytes due to recombinant
spike protein (rS1). (A) Monocytes increase extracellular acidification response rate (ECAR) when treated
with 30 nM rS1, but this is blocked by pre-treatment with chetomin. (B) Quantification of ECAR by area
under the curve (AUC). (C) rS1 increase of expression of IL1B, IL6, CXCL8, and TNF is reversed by
chetomin pre-treatment. *, **, ***: p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.001 vs. untreated cells. †, ††, †††: p<0.05,
p<0.01, p<0.001 vs. rS1-treated cells. N=7 biological replicates.

Figure 3. Targeting glycolysis has variable effects on recombinant spike protein (rS1) responses in
monocytes. (A) Glucose deprivation or pre-treatment with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) block extracellular
acidification rate (ECAR) increase due to rS1 treatment. (B) Quantification of ECAR by area under the
curve (AUC). (C) 2-DG inhibits oxygen consumption rate in rS1-treated monocytes, but glucose-deprived
monocytes upregulate OCR in response to rS1. (D) Quantification of OCR by AUC. (E) 2-DG blocks

Figure 4. Inhibiting AMPK blocks metabolic response to recombinant spike protein subunit 1 (rS1) in
glucose-deprived monocytes but has minimal effect on most cytokines. (A) Compound C pre-treatment
has no effect on extracellular acidification (ECAR). (B) Quantification of ECAR by area under the curve
(AUC). (C) Compound C blocks the increase in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in rS1-treated glucosedeprived monocytes. (D) Quantification of OCR by AUC. (E) Compound C pre-treatment inhibits TNF
expression in glucose-deprived monocytes stimulated with rS1, but does not significantly alter
expression of IL1B, IL6, or CXCL8. *, **, ***: p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.001 vs. glucose-treated cells. †, ††, †††:
