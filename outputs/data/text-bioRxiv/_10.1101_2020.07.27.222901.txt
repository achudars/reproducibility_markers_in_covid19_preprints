ABSTRACT
The ongoing SARSCoV-2 pandemic was introduced into Africa on 14th February 2020 and has
rapidly spread across the continent causing severe public health crisis and mortality. We
investigated the genetic diversity and evolution of this virus during the early outbreak months
using whole genome sequences. We performed; recombination analysis against closely related
CoV, Bayesian time scaled phylogeny and investigated spike protein amino acid mutations.
Results from our analysis showed recombination signals between the AfrSARSCoV-2 sequences
and reference sequences within the N and S genes. The evolutionary rate of the AfrSARSCoV-2
was 4.133 × 10-4 high posterior density HPD (4.132 × 10-4 to 4.134 × 10-4) substitutions/site/year.
The time to most recent common ancestor TMRCA of the African strains was December 7th
2019. The AfrSARCoV-2 sequences diversified into two lineages A and B with B being more
diverse with multiple sub-lineages confirmed by both maximum clade credibility MCC tree and
PANGOLIN software. There was a high prevalence of the D614-G spike protein amino acid
mutation (82.61%) among the African strains. Our study has revealed a rapidly diversifying viral
population with the G614 spike protein variant dominating, we advocate for up scaling NGS
sequencing platforms across Africa to enhance surveillance and aid control effort of SARSCoV2 in Africa.

INTRODUCTION
Towards the end of December 2018, Chinese authorities through the World Health Organization
office in China made known of a new pathogen responsible for a series of pneumonia associated
infections in Wuhan, Hubei province (WHO 2020). The pathogen was later identified to be a
novel coronavirus closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS), with a
possible bat origin (Zhou et al, 2020). The world health organization named the disease COVID19 (Chan et al, 2020), and later declared it a pandemic on 11th March 2020 prompting concerted
efforts towards prevention and control worldwide (WHO 2020). On Febuary 11th 2020 the
international committee on the taxonomy of viruses (ICTV) adopted the name SARS-CoV-2
following the report of their coronavirus working group (CSG, 2020). The virus has been placed
in the subgenera sarbecovirus, genus betacoronavirus, subfamily coronavirinea, family
Coronaviridea (de Groot et al, 2013; Gorbalenya et al, 2020).
Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses containing a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome
with a size of between 26kb to 32kb (Masters and Pearlman 2013). They are responsible for a
host of human and animal infections. The betacoronaviruses host the most medically important
species contains several human coronaviruses such as HuCoVOC43, HuCoVHKu13. The severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARSCoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus MERS are also members of this group, both have been shown to be pathogens of
high consequence that caused large scale epidemics and have been shown to be of zoonotic
origin (Lau et al, 2005; Zaki et al, 2012). Genomic and structural analyses have revealed that
SARSCoV-2 contains four structural proteins and several non structural proteins (Chen et al,
2020; Lu et al, 2020). The spike protein is the major antigenic protein responsible for initiating
infection, via attachment of its receptor binding domain (RBD) to the SARSCoV/SARSCoV-2
receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE 2 (Donelli et al, 2004; Monteil et al, 2020).
Globally, there have been 5,226,268 confirmed SARSCoV-2 cases globally, with 335,218 deaths
as at 21st of May 2020 (ECDC 2020). The coronavirus pandemic began in Egypt Africa on the
14th Febuary 2020 with an Italian who returned into the country (WHO 2020b). As at 21st of May
there have been 95,332 cases in Africa, with 2,995 deaths and 35,519 recoveries covering fifty
four countries in Africa with South Africa having the highest number of cases of 18,003 (WHO
2020c). Several reports have traced the evolutionary origins of SARSCoV-2 to SARSrCoV from
bats (Zhou et al, 2020) and Pangolins (Lam et al 2020).
Phlogenetic analysis has shown that the virus has diversified through the duration of the
pandemic into three major lineages A and B with several sub-lineage diversifications (Rambault
et al 2020). Majority of the reports were generated using genome sequences of SARSCoV-2
from America, Europe and Asia (Rambault et al, 2020). There has been paucity of data on the
genetic evolution of SARSCoV-2 sequences from Africa, despite the increasing number of
genome sequence submissions into the GISAID database from Africa; there were 97 whole
genome sequences available in the GISAID database as at 24th April 2020. This gap in

knowledge prompted the conceptualization of this study. This study was designed to determine
to the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of genome sequences of SARSCoV-2 isolated in
Africa.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA CURATION
Full genome sequences with high coverage were downloaded from the Global initiative for
sharing of Avian Influenza data GISAID database. As at 24th April there were 97 full genome
sequences from Africa available in the GISAID database we downloaded all of them excluding
genomes with low coverage. A total of 69 high coverage genomes were eventually selected from
the African sequences, along with these 151 high quality full genome sequences were also
downloaded from three continents America (USA), Asia (China and South Korea) and Europe
(England, Italy and Germany). Three different datasets were then generated from these
sequences, the first dataset consisted of high coverage full genome sequences from Africa, along
with the SARSCoV2 reference genome sequence from Wuhan, China, Bat and Pangolin SARS
related reference sequences and SARSCoV reference sequence. The second dataset consisted of
complete genome sequences from Africa, America, Asia and Europe, while the third dataset
consisted of complete spike protein (S) gene sequences from Africa, Bat and Pangolin SARS
related reference S gene sequences.
PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS
Whole genome sequences downloaded from the GISAID database were aligned using
MAFFTv7.222 (FF-NS-2 algorithm) following default settings (Katoh et al, 2019). Maximum
likelihood phylogenetic analysis was performed using the general time reversible nucleotide
substitution model with gamma distributed rate variation GTR-Γ(Yang et al, 1994) with 1000
bootstrap replicates using IQ-TREE software (Nguyen et al 2015). Lineage assignments for the
SARSCoV-2 sequences were conducted using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global
Outbreak LINeages tool (PANGOLIN), available at http://github.com/hCoV-2019/pangolin
(O’Toole and McCrone 2020).
RECOMBINATION ANALYSIS
We analyzed potential recombination events using the recombination detection program RPD
software (Martin et al, 2015). The analysis was conducted on whole genome sequences of
identified lineages among the African isolates, using RDP, bootscan analysis, GENECOV,
Chimera, SISCAN, 3SEQ, and maximum chisquare methods. A putative recombination event
was passed only if three of the above mentioned methods gave a positive recombination signal
(Liu et al, 2010).

EVOLUTIONARY AND TIME SCALED PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS
Temporal clock signal was analyzed among the aligned sequences using TempEst version 1.5
(Rambault et al, 2016). The root-to-tip divergence and sampling dates supported the use of
molecular clock analysis in this study. Phylogenetic trees were generated by Bayesian inference
through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), implemented in BEAST version 1.10.4 (Suchard
et al, 2016). We partitioned the coding genes into first+second and third codon positions and
applied a separate Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY+G) substitution model with gammadistributed rate heterogeneity among sites to each partition (Hasaegawa et al, 1985). The relaxed
clock with Gausian Markov Random Field Skyride plot (GMRF) coalescent prior was selected
for the final analysis, after running different models and comparing them using Bayes factor
with marginal likelihood estimated using the path sampling and stepping stone methods
implemented in BEAST version 1.10.4 (Suchard et al, 2016). One hundred million MCMC
chains were run with10% burn in. Results were then visualized with Tracer version 1.8.
(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/), all effective sampling size ESS values were >200
indicating sufficient sampling. Bayesian skyride analysis was carried out to visualize the
epidemic evolutionary history using Tracer v 1.8.
ANALYSIS OF SARSCoV-2 SPIKE PROTEIN
Complete S protein gene sequence of AfrSARSCoV-2 was aligned along with RaTG13 BtCoV
and Pangolin SARSrCoV sequences using MAFFT (Katoh et al, 2015). The alignment was then
edited and visualized using BioEdit software.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The current global SARSCoV-2 pandemic, otherwise known as COVID-19 began on the African
continent from a European returnee in Egypt on February 17th 2020 (WHO 2020). It has since
spread to virtually all the countries within the African region. This study was based on sequences
generated during the early phase of the pandemic in Africa precisely between, February 2020
and April 2020. Sixty nine high coverage full genome sequences from six African countries,
namely Algeria (3), Senegal (20), Democratic republic of Congo DRC (35), Nigeria (1), Ghana
(6) and South Africa (4) were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis of the African sequences showed
clustering within the sarbecovirus sub-genus forming a sub-cluster with SARSr CoV and PCoV
(Figure 1) as previously reported by several workers(Zhao et al, 2020; Lam et al, 2020; Zhang et
al, 2020). The root to tip regression analysis showed a not so strong signal with a correlation of
coefficient of 0.995 and R2 = 0.991 (Supplementary Figure 1).

19 Pangolin/Guangu P4L/2017; Minor parent hCoV-19 B batYunan/RaTG13) between the RdRP
and S gene regions (Figure 2). This result is consistent with a previous report from Saudi Arabia
which investigated the recombination between SARSCoV-2 and closely related viruses such as
SARSCoV and MERS (Nour et al, 2020). Evolutionary rate for the AfrSARSCoV-2 isolates
during the period under study was 4.133 × 10-4 substitutions/site/year, high posterior density
interval HPD (4.132 × 10-4 to 4.134 × 10-4). This is slightly higher than that of an earlier report
from early outbreak strains from China with a rate of 3.345 × 10-4 (Li et al, 2020), it is however
lower than the calculated global SARSCoV-2 evolutionary rate estimated to be 8.0 × 10-4
reported by Nexstrain (www.nextstrain.org/ncov/global ). The MCC tree of the African
SARSCoV-2 sequences shows that they have evolved into two major lineages A and B with
lineage B being more diverse. Majority of the African SARSCoV sequences clustered within
lineage B, while three Ghanaian, three Congolese, and four Senegalese strains clustered along
with the reference Chinese and South Korean strains within lineage A (Figure 3). The MCC tree
for the dataset containing global reference sequences also showed a similar topology with that of
the African tree, the tree was distributed into two major lineages A and B, with lineage B further
diversifying into about four sub-lineages, while lineage A seemed to evolve into only two sublineages (Figure 4). The AfrSARSCoV-2 strains were intermixed with the global sequences
within both lineages, lineage B consisted mainly of strains from Germany, England, Italy and
USA, intermixed with African strains; while lineage A consisted mainly of strains from South
Korea and China with a few African strains from Senegal, Ghana and DRC. The result of the
genotype analysis using the genotyping tool PANGOLIN was largely in conformity with
observed phylogenetic analysis. Figure 5 shows a summary of the lineage distribution of the
isolates by country of origin using the PANGOLIN genotyping tool. The complete distribution of
the strains according to lineage and country is shown in supplementary Table 2. From the
analysis with PANGOLIN, lineage B.1 was the most commonly encountered and the most
widely distributed, consisting of 93 sequences from Seven countries, followed by lineage B.2
and genotype B. Lineage A had 15 positive sequences from six countries. Majority of the
sequences recorded high bootstrap values with over 70% of the sequences recording a bootstrap
value of above 80%. This shows that the PANGOLIN is a reliable tool with a broad scope of
functions including a user friendly and interactive representation of phylogenetic clustering of
the identified sub-lineages and lineages by means of graphical images of the trees generated
using virtually all available SARCoV-2 sequences available on GISAID platform as reference.
The genotyping tool was recently introduced several reports have utilized it in predicting lineage
assignments accurately (Xaiveir et al, 2020). The time to most recent common ancestor TMRCA
of the African SARSCoV-2 strains was December 7th 2019 (November 12th 2019-December 29th
2019), while the TMRCA of all the sequences under analysis was 14th October 2019 (July 27th
2019-December 17th 2019). Our TMRCA was lower than a similar study which reported a
TMRCA of 14th October 2019 among global isolates including Chinese isolates (Li et al, 2020),
but was slightly higher than another recent study investigating the evolutionary dynamics of the
ongoing SARSCoV-2 epidemic in Brazil which reported a TMRCA of 10th February 2020

(Xaiveir et al, 2020). The epidemic history of the ongoing outbreak was investigated using the
Bayesian Skyline Plot BSP. The BSP showed a steady increase in viral population as the
outbreak progressed under the study period (Figure 6). This observation is expected as viral
sequence population is supposed to increase as the infection spreads. A major limitation was the
rather small number of sequences analyzed and very short study duration; therefore our results
may not reflect the exact viral population dynamic of the outbreak in Africa.
The AfrSARSCoV-2 sequences were analyzed for the D614-G mutation within the S1 subunit of
the spike protein, which has been reported to contribute to increased transmissibility of
SARSCoV-2 (Korber et al, 2020). Figure 7 shows a representative amino acid alignment of
selected Afr SARSCoV-2 sequences along with reference sequences of BtCoV RaTG13 and
PCoV. Our results revealed high prevalence of D614-G mutation among AfrSARSCoV-2 with
12/69 (17.39%). The mutation was recorded in isolates from all African countries analyzed in
this study, supplementary figure 2. Prior to this report the D614-G spike mutation was found
predominantly in Europe accompanied by high number of cases and significant mortality rate
(Pachetti et al, 2020; Korber et al, 2020b). The introduction of this strain in Africa is quite
worrisome, considering the population densities of most African cities and the poor state of
public health infrastructure to support medical intervention of symptomatic SARSCoV-2 cases.
Although more evidence is still required to determine the extent of the effect of the D614-G
mutation on the virulence properties of the virus, current evidence from in vitro studies seem to
support the hypothesis of increased transmissibility of this variant of the virus (Korber et al,
2020; Hu et al, 2020).
In conclusion we have reported the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of SARSCoV-2
isolated in Africa during the early outbreak period. Our findings have identified diverse sublineages of SARSCoV-2 currently circulating among Africans. We also identified high
prevalence of the D614-G spike protein variant of the virus capable of rapid transmission in all
countries sampled. A major limitation was the relatively low amount of sequence submission
available in GISAID database compared with those of other regions such as Europe and Asia.
We advocate for upscale of next generation sequencing NGS capacity for whole genome
sequencing of SARCoV-2 samples across the African continent to support surveillance and
control effort in Africa.
