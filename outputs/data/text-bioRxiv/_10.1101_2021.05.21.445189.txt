ABSTRACT

37

Background: Vaccine efficacy against the B.1.351 variant following mRNA-1273 vaccination

38

in humans has not been determined. Nonhuman primates (NHP) are a useful model for

39

demonstrating whether mRNA-1273 mediates protection against B.1.351.

40

Methods: Nonhuman primates received 30 or 100 µg of mRNA-1273 as a prime-boost vaccine

41

at 0 and 4 weeks, a single immunization of 30 µg at week 0, or no vaccine. Antibody and T cell

42

responses were assessed in blood, bronchioalveolar lavages (BAL), and nasal washes. Viral

43

replication in BAL and nasal swabs were determined by qRT-PCR for sgRNA, and

44

histopathology and viral antigen quantification were performed on lung tissue post-challenge.

45

Results: Eight weeks post-boost, 100 µg x2 of mRNA-1273 induced reciprocal ID50 neutralizing

46

geometric mean titers against live SARS-CoV-2 D614G and B.1.351 of 3300 and 240,

47

respectively, and 430 and 84 for the 30 µg x2 group. There were no detectable neutralizing

48

antibodies against B.1351 after the single immunization of 30 µg. On day 2 following B.1.351

49

challenge, sgRNA in BAL was undetectable in 6 of 8 NHP that received 100 µg x2 of mRNA-

50

1273, and there was a ~2-log reduction in sgRNA in NHP that received two doses of 30 µg

51

compared to controls. In nasal swabs, there was a 1-log10 reduction observed in the 100 µg x2

52

group. There was limited inflammation or viral antigen in lungs of vaccinated NHP post-

53

challenge.

54

Conclusions:

55

Immunization with two doses of mRNA-1273 achieves effective immunity that rapidly controls

56

lower and upper airway viral replication against the B.1.351 variant in NHP.

INTRODUCTION

58

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has led to more

59

than 3.4 million deaths worldwide1. Vaccination with two 100 µg doses of mRNA-1273, a lipid

60

nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated messenger RNA-based vaccine encoding a stabilized full-

61

length SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 spike (S) glycoprotein, proved 94% efficacious against

62

symptomatic COVID-19 in the United States (US)2. mRNA-1273 is authorized by the US Food

63

and Drug Administration for Emergency Use (EUA).

64

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC)3 that show reduced neutralization by

65

sera from Wu-1 strain convalescent subjects or vaccinees4-6 has created uncertainty about the

66

efficacy of current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines against VOC infection. To date, the most concerning

67

variants contain combinations of mutations and deletions in the S receptor-binding domain

68

(RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD), respectively. Acquisition of amino acid substitutions in

69

the S RBD-- namely K417N, E484K, and N501Y—and in the NTD, such as L18F, D80A,

70

D215G, and

71

neutralization sensitivity7-17. Variants containing these substitutions originally isolated in the

72

United Kingdom (UK) (B.1.1.7), Republic of South Africa (B.1.351), Brazil (P.1 lineage), New

73

York (B.1.526), and California (B.1.427/B.1.429), have shown varying reduction in

74

neutralization by convalescent and vaccine serum, and are resistant to some monoclonal

75

antibodies14,18-24. Among these variants, B.1.351 contains the most concerning set of

76

mutations in the RBD and NTD subdomains25.

77

We and others recently reported that sera from mRNA-1273-immunized human and nonhuman

78

primates (NHP) showed the greatest reduction of neutralization against B.1.351 compared to

79

B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.427/B.1.429, and B.1.1.7+E484K variants7-17,26. In UK- or US-based clinical

Δ242-244,

is associated with increased transmissibility and reduction in

80

studies, NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax), AZD1222 (University of Oxford/AstraZeneca), and

81

Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) vaccines show between ~70 and 90% protection

82

against the circulating D614G or B.1.1.7 variants11,27-29, and vaccine efficacy against mild

83

symptomatic COVID-19 caused by B.1.351 was up to 60% for Ad26.CoV229 and NVX-

84

CoV237330 and ~10% for AZD12231. A recent report showed BNT162b2, Pfizer’s mRNA

85

vaccine, conferred ~75% protection against confirmed B.1.351 infection in Qatar32. While

86

immunological assessments for all vaccine trials are underway and correlates of protection are

87

not yet determined, these data highlight the potential impact that reduced neutralization capacity

88

to B.1.351 may have on protection against mild symptomatic COVID-19 across various

89

platforms. Though comparable to BNT162b2 in other settings, human efficacy trials with

90

mRNA-1273 have not been conducted in regions where B.1.351 circulates as a dominant variant.

91

Vaccine development for COVID-19 has benefitted from clinically translatable data from the

92

NHP33-39. As there have been no published studies on vaccine protection in NHP challenged with

93

the B.1.351 variant, we evaluated the impact of the dose and number of immunizations with

94

mRNA-1273 on immunogenicity and protection against B.1.351 challenge in NHP.

95
96

METHODS

97

Pre-clinical mRNA-1273 mRNA and Lipid Nanoparticle Production Process

98

A sequence-optimized mRNA encoding prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S-2P40,41 protein was

99

synthesized in vitro. The mRNA was purified by oligo-dT affinity purification and encapsulated

100

in a lipid nanoparticle through a modified ethanol-drop nanoprecipitation process described

101

previously42.

103

Animal experiments were carried out in compliance with US National Institutes of Health

104

regulations and approval from the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Vaccine Research

105

Center and Bioqual, Inc. (Rockville, MD). Challenge studies were conducted at Bioqual, Inc.

106

Male and female, 3-12 year-old, Indian-origin rhesus macaques were sorted by sex, age and

107

weight (Supplemental Appendix) and then stratified into groups of four. NHP were immunized

108

intramuscularly (IM) at week 0 and week 4-5 with either 30 or 100 µg mRNA-1273 in 1 mL of

109

1X PBS into the right hind leg or 30 µg at week 0. Naïve aged-matched NHP were included as

110

controls. At week 12 (7-8 weeks post-boost or 12 weeks after the single vaccination), all NHP

111

were challenged with a total dose of 5x105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 strain. The viral

112

inoculum was administered as 3.75x105 PFU in 3 mL intratracheally (IT) and 1.25x105 PFU in 1

113

mL intranasally (IN) in a volume of 0.5 mL into each nostril. Pre- and post-challenge sample

114

collection is detailed in Figure S1.

115

Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and sgRNA

116

At the time of collection, NS were frozen in 1 mL of 1X PBS containing 1 μL of SUPERase-In

117

RNase Inhibitor (Invitrogen) and BAL was mixed with 1 mL of RNAzol BD containing 10 μL

118

acetic acid and both were frozen at -80°C until extraction. Extraction and quantitation of sgRNA

119

envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) were performed as previously described38.

Multiplexed plates (96-well) precoated with SARS-CoV-2 S-2P41 and RBD proteins from the

122

following strains: WA-1, B.1.351, B.1.1.7, and P.1., SARS-CoV-2 N protein, and Bovine Serum

123

Albumin (BSA) are supplied by the manufacturer [Meso Scale Display (MSD)]. Determination

124

of antibody binding was performed as previously described43.

126

MSD SECTOR® plates are precoated by the manufacturer with SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S-2P41,

127

RBD, and N) and a BSA control in each well in a specific spot-designation for each antigen.

128

Determination of antibody binding was performed as previously described38.

129

Meso Scale ELISA for Mucosal Antibody Responses

130

Using previously described methods44, total S-specific IgG and IgA were determined by

131

MULTI-ARRAY ELISA using Meso Scale technology (Meso Scale Discovery, MSD).

132

Lentiviral Pseudovirus Neutralization Assay

133

As previously described45, pseudotyped lentiviral reporter viruses were produced by the co-

134

transfection of plasmids encoding S proteins from Wuhan-1 strain (Genbank #: MN908947.3)

135

with a D614G mutation, a luciferase reporter, lentivirus backbone, and human transmembrane

136

protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) genes into HEK293T/17 cells (ATCC CRL-11268). Similarly,

137

pseudoviruses containing S from B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.1.7 were produced. Sera, in duplicate,

138

were tested for neutralizing activity against the pseudoviruses by quantification of luciferase

139

activity [in relative light units (RLU)].

140

VSV Pseudovirus Neutralization Assay

141

To make SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped recombinant VSV-ΔG-firefly luciferase virus, BHK21/WI-

142

2 cells (Kerafast, EH1011) were transfected with the Wuhan-1 strain (Genbank #: MN908947.3)

143

S plasmid expressing full-length S with D614G mutation or S of B.1.351. Neutralization assays

144

were completed on A549-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells with serially diluted serum samples as

145

previously described26.

146

Focus Reduction Neutralization Test (FRNT)

147

Viruses were propagated in Vero-TMPRSS2 cells to generate viral stocks. Viral titers were

148

determined by focus-forming assay on VeroE6 cells. Viral stocks were stored at -80°C until use.

149

FRNT assays were performed as previously described 46.

150

Statistical Analysis

151

Graphs show data from individual NHP with dotted lines indicating assay limits of detection.

152

Groups were compared by Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon Rank-sum tests

153

with Holm’s adjustment on the set of pairwise tests if the Kruskal-Wallis was significant, for the

154

primary analysis of viral load at day 2 in the BAL and NS, as well as other comparisons between

155

dose groups. Correlations were estimated and tested using Spearman’s nonparametric method.

156

Linear regression was used to explore the relationship between antibody levels and sgRNA,

157

including quadratic terms for comparing the newly generated data and that previously published

158

(ref)47, with likelihood ratio tests to compare models and assess interaction effects.

RESULTS

161

Humoral and mucosal antibody responses following mRNA-1273 vaccination

162

Vaccination of NHP with 10-100 µg of mRNA-1273 at weeks 0 and 4 conferred rapid and

163

complete control of detectable viral replication in both the upper and lower airways following

164

SARS-CoV-2 USA/Washington-1 (WA-1) challenge33,38. In the current study, to assess the

165

influence of dose and number of immunizations on immunogenicity and protection against

166

B.1.351, NHP were immunized with 30 or 100 µg in the standard 0- and 4-week vaccine regimen

167

(x2) or a single dose (x1) of 30 µg (Figure S1).

168

We first performed a temporal analysis of serum neutralizing antibody responses after single

169

immunization or prime and boost with mRNA-1273. Neutralizing responses of 50 and 99

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.21.445189; this version posted May 24, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

170

geometric mean reciprocal ID50 titers (GMT) were detected against D614G by 2 weeks after a

171

single immunization with 30 or 100 µg of mRNA-1273, respectively. Consistent with our prior

172

study38, there was a ~100-fold increase in D614G-specific neutralizing antibodies following a

173

boost with 100 or 30 µg of mRNA-1273. All 8 of the 100 µg x2 immunized NHP and 7 of 8

174

receiving 30 µg x2 had >103 reciprocal ID50 titers (Figures 1E-G and S2A) and 14/16 animals

175

from the 2-dose regimen had detectable neutralizing activity against B.1.351 (Figures 1E-G and

176

S2B). By contrast, only 6/8 NHP that received a single dose of 30 µg had detectable neutralizing

177

responses against D614G (Figures 1E-G and S2A), and none (0/8) had detectable neutralizing

178

antibodies against B.1.351 (Figures 1E-G and S2B). Following boost in the 30 and 100 µg x2

179

groups, neutralizing antibodies against B.1.351 remained >102 and >103 reciprocal ID50 GMT,

180

respectively (Figures 1E-G and S2B). These data support the importance of boosting to increase

181

neutralizing responses against the B.1351 variant.

182

Focusing on the time of challenge, ~8 weeks post-boost or 12 weeks after the single

183

immunization, S-specific binding and neutralizing antibody responses were assessed. Using a 10-

184

plex MULTI-ARRAY ELISA, we assessed WA-1 and B.1.351 S- and RBD- specific antibody

185

binding responses (Figure 1A-D), which represent the vaccine and challenge strains,

186

respectively. Binding to S and RBD proteins representing the P.1 lineage, which is prominent in

187

Brazil, and the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant, which is circulating globally, were also

188

assessed (Figure S3A-D). There was a vaccine dose-dependent increase in S- and RBD-specific

189

antibody responses against WA-1 (Figure 1A-B) and B.1.351 (Figure 1C-D), where, for

190

example, a single dose of 30 µg of mRNA-1273 elicited 1,800 area under the curve (AUC) units

191

for B.1.351 S-specific antibody responses, and two doses of 100 µg elicited 19,000 AUC.

192

B.1.1.7 (Figure S3A-B). P.1 (Figure S3C-D) S- and RBD-specific responses were similarly

193

dose-dependent.

194

In vitro neutralizing activity was next determined using two orthogonal pseudovirus

195

neutralization assays and a live virus assay. Neutralizing responses against B.1.351 was

196

compared to D614G, the benchmark strain that is being used for correlates analysis of the Phase

197

3 studies with mRNA-1273 and other vaccines. Using a D614G lentiviral-based pseudovirus

198

neutralization assay, the reciprocal ID50 GMT was ~3,600 following two doses of 100 µg.

199

Consistent with the 8-fold reduction reported by us and others using human vaccine or

200

convalescent serum26,43,48-50, the reciprocal ID50 GMT against B.1.351 was ~450. Notably, in

201

NHP that received a single 30 µg dose of mRNA, the reciprocal ID50 GMT against D614G was

202

~150, but there were no detectable neutralizing antibodies against B.1.351 (Figure 1E). We

203

observed similar outcomes using VSV-based pseudovirus (Figure 1F) and live virus (Figure

204

1G) neutralization assays. To extend the analysis, neutralization against the B.1.1.7 and P.1

205

variants was assessed. There was little change in neutralization in any vaccine group comparing

206

D614G to B.1.1.7 (Figure S3E); however, the reduction in neutralization against the P.1 variant

207

compared to D614G was similar to that observed with B.1.351 (Figure S3F). Taking all of these

208

data together, antibody binding and neutralization responses were highly correlated with one

209

another (Figure S4).

210

To extend the antibody analyses to the mucosal sites of infection, S-specific IgG and IgA in BAL

211

and nasal wash samples were assessed at ~3 weeks post-boost or 7 weeks after the single 30 µg

212

immunization. Consistent with systemic humoral responses, there was a dose-dependent increase

213

in BAL and nasal wash WA-1 or B.1.351 S-specific IgG and IgA (Figure 1H-O). BAL WA-1

214

(Figure 1H) or B.1.351 (Figure 1I) S-specific IgG titers following two doses of 30 or 100 µg of

215

mRNA-1273 ranged from a GMT of 104 - 107 AUC, and nasal wash WA-1 (Figure 1J) or

216

B.1.351 (Figure 1K) S-specific IgG titers ranged from 102 – 105AUC. For BAL, there was also a

217

dose-dependent trend for WA-1 (Figure 1L) or B.1.351 (Figure 1M) S-specific IgA titers, albeit

218

to lower magnitude than for IgG. mRNA-1273 did not induce notable upper airway WA-1

219

(Figure 1N) or B.1.351 (Figure 1O) S-specific IgA responses as nasal wash IgA levels in all

220

vaccine groups were similar to control NHP. Overall, mRNA-1273 vaccination elicits WA-1 and

221

B.1.351 S-specific IgG and IgA antibodies in serum and lower airways and IgG in the upper

222

airways as previously shown38.

223

T cell responses following mRNA-1273 vaccination

224

mRNA 1273 induces Th1, CD4 T follicular helper (Tfh) responses and CD8 T cells in NHP and

225

humans33,51,52. Consistent with these data, S-specific Th1 responses were induced in a dose-

226

dependent manner with higher responses in the 100 µg dose group (Figure 2A). There were low

227

to undetectable Th2 responses in all vaccine groups (Figure 2B). There was also dose-

228

dependence in the frequency of S-specific Tfh responses expressing the surface marker CD40L

229

(Figure 2C) or the canonical cytokine IL-21 (Figure 2D), which are critical for improving

230

antibody responses. S-specific CD8 T cell responses were observed in 5/8 NHP that received two

231

doses of 100 µg mRNA-1273 (Figure 2E). These data show that mRNA-1273 induces Th1- and

232

Tfh-skewed CD4 responses and CD8 T cells at the highest dose.

233

Protective Efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 Replication in Upper and Lower Airways

234

As this is the first study to challenge NHP with B.1.351, an extensive analysis was performed to

235

characterize the sequence and in vivo pathogenicity. Deep sequencing was performed after each

236

passage (P) of the B.1.351 strain, which was first isolated at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). P1

237

and P2 stocks were compared to the B.1.351 reference strain and the original JHU clinical isolate

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.21.445189; this version posted May 24, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

238

and retained all mutations in the RBD and NTD sites on the spike protein (Figure S5A). The

239

JHU B.1.351 P2 stock was then administered to Golden Syrian hamsters, a highly pathogenic

240

SARS-CoV-2 animal model, at three different concentrations to characterize weight loss (Figure

241

S5B) and in NHP to measure upper and lower airway viral replication by qRT-PCR for sgRNA

242

(Figures S5C-D). Based on these data, a B.1.351 challenge dose of 5x105 PFU was selected for

the vaccine study; this dose would induce sgRNA levels similar to the higher values obtained

244

from nasal secretions of humans following SARS-CoV-2 infection53,54.

245

To assess protective efficacy of mRNA-1273 against the B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variant, the NHP

246

were challenged with a total dose of 5x105 PFU of B.1.351 by intratracheal (IT) and intranasal

247

(IN) routes 7-8 weeks post-boost for the two-dose regimens and 12 weeks after the single dose

248

regimen (Figure S1). Two days post-challenge, only 2 of 8 NHP that received 100 µg of mRNA-

249

1273 had detectable SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) sgRNA (sgRNA _E) in BAL compared to 8 of 8

250

in the control group (Figure 3A). By sgRNA_E (Figure 3A) or nucleocapsid (N) sgRNA

251

(sgRNA _N) qRT-PCR (Figure 3C), the 100 µg group had a significant decrease in viral load

252

compared to NHP that received a single dose of 30 µg (p = 0.0054) or to the control NHP (p =

253

0.0009). NHP that received 30 µg x2 also had a significant decrease in viral load compared to

254

control NHP (p = 0.0054) and showed a trend toward reduced viral replication compared to a

255

single immunization with 30 µg. NHP that received a single vaccination with 30 µg showed a

256

trend toward reduced viral replication compared to control NHP. At day 4 post-challenge, the

257

pattern was the same, with significant reduction in viral replication in BAL for all vaccine groups

258

compared to control NHP, and for the 100 µg group compared to 30 µg x1 (Figures 3A,C). By

259

day 7, while 7 of 8 control NHP still had ~4 logs of sgRNA_E, there was no detectable

260

sgRNA_E in 6 of 8 NHP in all vaccine groups (Figure 3A), consistent with control of viral

261

replication in the lower airway. In addition, the inability to culture virus from the BAL of 4/8 and

262

7/8 NHP immunized with 30 and 100 µg x2 of mRNA-1273, respectively, two days post-

263

challenge further confirms the ability of mRNA-1273 to control lower airway viral replication

264

(Figure 3E). Moreover, on day 2 post-challenge, BAL viral titers and sgRNA were highly

265

correlated (Figures 3F-G), where no virus was culturable from BAL of all NHP with BAL

266

sgRNA_N <1.2x104 RNA copies/mL (Figure 3G).

267

In contrast to the significant reduction of viral replication in the lower airway, at day 2 post-

268

challenge, the only significant reduction in viral replication for sgRNA_E (Figure 3B) or sgRNA

269

_N (Figure 3D) in nasal swabs (NS) was in the 100 µg dose group. The differences in NHP that

270

received 100 µg x2 were marginally lower compared to the groups that received 30 µg x2 or 30

271

µg x1 (p = 0.0273 and 0.0350, respectively) with no other significant pairwise differences. The

272

groups were not significantly different at the later time points. A notable finding was that 5 of 8

273

control NHP still had ~4 log10 of sgRNA_E and all 8 NHP had sgRNA_N at day 7 in the NS,

274

highlighting persistence of sgRNA following B.1.351 through day 7 post-challenge. With that,

275

there was ~4 log10 of sgRNA_E in the NS of 3 of 8 NHP in the 100 µg x2 group. Overall, these

276

data show significant reduction and rapid control of B.1.351 viral replication in the lower

277

airways of mRNA-1273 immunized NHP with more limited control in the upper airway.

278

Inflammation and viral load in lung tissue post-challenge

279

To provide a further assessment of protection following vaccination, NHP in each of the dose

280

groups were assessed for virus-related pathology and for the detection of viral antigen (VAg) in

281

the lung 8 days post B.1.351 challenge. The severity of inflammation, which ranged from

282

minimal to moderate, was similar across lung samples from NHP that received vaccine in doses

283

of 100 µg x2, 30 µg x2, or 30 µg x1 (Figure S6). The inflammatory lesions in the lung were

284

characterized by a mixture of lymphocytes, histiocytes and fewer polymorphonuclear cells

285

associated with variably expanded alveolar capillaries, occasional areas of perivascular

286

inflammation, and Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. Two out of 4 NHP that received 30 µg x1 of

287

mRNA-1273 vaccine had trace amounts of virus detected in the lung. There was no detection of

288

VAg in any lung sample from NHP that received two doses of 30 or 100 µg. All 4 NHP in the

289

control group had variable amounts of VAg detected in the lung (Figure S6, Table S1).

290

Post-challenge humoral and mucosal antibody responses

291

The assessment of antibody responses post-challenge has been useful for determining whether

292

viral replication in the BAL or NS is sufficient to boost vaccine-induced anamnestic S-specific

293

antibody responses in these mucosal tissues38,44. In BAL, WA-1 and B.1351 S-specific IgG

294

(Figures S7A-B) or IgA (Figures S7C-D) responses did not increase post-challenge in NHP that

295

received two immunizations of 30 or 100 µg of mRNA-1273. However, by 14 days post-

296

challenge, there was an increase in WA-1 and B.1.351 S-specific IgG responses in NHP that

297

received 30 µg x1 of mRNA-1273, to levels that were similar to the NHP that received 30 or 100

298

µg x2 and higher than the unvaccinated controls (Figures S7A-D). In NS, there was an increase

299

in WA-1 and B.1.351 S-specific IgG (Figures S7E-F) or IgA (Figures S7G-H) responses in

300

unvaccinated NHP and those immunized with 30 µg of mRNA-1273 once or twice; however,

301

there were no anamnestic S-specific antibody responses in 100 µg dose group. Overall, these

302

data show that the increase in S-specific anamnestic antibody responses in both the BAL and NS

303

are associated with viral replication in these mucosal sites and may explain the relatively rapid

304

clearance of virus from NS in the 30 µg x1 dose group.

305

Antibody correlates of protection

306

Assessing immune correlates of protection following vaccination is a critical aspect of vaccine

307

development. We recently reported that mRNA-1273 induced antibody responses are a

308

mechanistic correlate for reducing viral replication against WA-1 challenge in NHP38. Here,

309

B.1.351 S-specific IgG antibody titers at week 12, the time of challenge, also correlated strongly

310

with reduction of sgRNA in both BAL (Figure 4A) and NS (Figure 4D) at day 2 post-challenge.

311

In addition, both pseudovirus and live viral neutralization correlate significantly with reduction

312

of sgRNA in both BAL (Figure 4B-C) and NS (Figures 4E-F).

313

In a recent report on correlates of protection following mRNA-1273 immunization in NHP, we

314

established a linear relationship between WA-1 S-specific antibody titers as defined by

315

international units (IU) and subsequent sgRNA 2 days after SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 challenge.

316

Here, we similarly converted pre-challenge WA-1 S-specific antibody titers to IU (Table S2).

317

Again, pre-challenge WA-1 S-specific IgG titers and sgRNA in BAL (Figure 4G) and NS

318

(Figure 4H) at day 2 post-challenge were negatively correlated. Based on a linear model,

319

vaccinated animals that had S-specific IgG of 100 and 120 IU/mL were predicted to have

320

sgRNA_N and sgRNA_E, respectively, in BAL of approximately 2 log10 lower than the average

321

for PBS controls. Serum neutralizing activity was associated with control of viral replication;

322

13/14 of the NHP with detectable pseudovirus neutralizing activity against B.1.351 had BAL

323

sgRNA_N <105 (Figure 4B). A similar linear relationship between S-specific antibody levels

324

and viral replication in nasal swabs was apparent, although few of the NHP had NS sgRNA_N

325

below 105.

326

As the antibody levels of S-specific IgG are very similar to those we had previously reported

327

using NHP challenged with the SARS-CoV-2 WA-138, we conducted an additional exploratory

328

analysis of the data from both studies to investigate the consistency of the relationship between

329

S-specific antibodies and BAL sgRNA, across the two different viruses. For low S-specific IgG

330

levels, sgRNA was higher for animals challenged with B.1.351, but for animals with levels of S-

331

specific IgG greater than approximately 100 IU/mL, the estimated regression curve slopes are

332

similar as are the levels that correspond to 2-4 log10 reductions in sgRNA in BAL compared to

333

controls (Figure 4I). These data suggest a similar relationship between S-specific IgG levels and

334

lower airway protection against homologous and variant SARS-CoV-2 strains in NHP.

335
336

DISCUSSION

337

mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines were shown to be ~95% effective in clinical trials

338

performed in the US, during which times WA-1 and D614G variants circulated most widely2,55.

339

A critical issue is whether these and other vaccines will mediate protection against the rapidly

340

emerging variants. At present, the B.1.351 variant is one of greatest concern compared to WA-1,

341

D614G, or B.1.1.7 based on the higher reduction in neutralization using vaccine sera7-17 and

342

clinical trials showing lower efficacy against mild infection29-31. Here, we present evidence that

343

mRNA-1273 can significantly reduce viral replication in the upper and lower airways and

344

prevent or limit inflammation in the lung following B.1.351 challenge in NHP. Importantly, the

345

dose of the vaccine and number of immunizations had a significant effect on the protective

346

capacity. These data are consistent with a recent report showing that vaccine effectiveness

347

against PCR-confirmed infection with the B.1.351 variant is 16% after 1 dose of BNT162b2 and

348

75% after two doses32.

349

Antibodies play a critical role in mediating vaccine-elicited protection against SARS-CoV-2 in

350

NHP models33,37,39,44,56,57. Here, we show that there was a dose-dependent increase in WA-1 and

351

B.1.351 S- and RBD-specific antibody titers and D614G and B.1.351 neutralization titers

352

(Figure 1A-D). Of note, there was ~5-10-fold reduction in sensitivity to neutralization for

353

B.1.351 compared to D614G, consistent with many reports assessing responses from humans

354

that received mRNA 1273 or other vaccines. There was also a dose-dependent increase in WA-1

355

and B.1351 S-specific IgG in BAL and nasal washes, where IgA was detected only in the 100 µg

356

group. Importantly, while there were detectable neutralization titers against D614G following a

357

single immunization with 30 µg, these NHP had no detectable neutralization against B.1.351. By

358

contrast, neutralizing titers against B.1.351 following a second immunization with 30 or 100 µg

359

increased to ~103 reciprocal ID50 titer. These data highlight the importance of a prime and boost

360

regimen for optimizing neutralization antibody responses, particularly against B.1.351 and likely

361

for any other variant of concern for which vaccine-induced neutralization is decreased. Last, the

362

frequency of S-specific Th1 and Tfh responses were also dose-dependent, with CD8 T cell

363

responses detected in blood only in NHP receiving the 100 µg dose. These data corroborate

364

previous studies by us and others that have shown a direct correlation between CD4 T cell

365

responses, most notably Tfh cells, and improved magnitude and function of antibody responses

366

in NHP33,38,51,58.

367

As this was the first study to use the B.1.351 variant for challenge in NHP, extensive sequence

368

analyses were performed to propagate a challenge stock with a matched S sequence as compared

369

to the reference isolate59. Naïve NHP infected with the B.1.351 stock notably had peak sgRNA

370

levels of ~107 copies/mL in BAL, which is higher than reported by us and others for challenge

371

studies using the WA-1 strain33,37,39,44,56,57. At 7 days post-challenge, most of the control NHP

372

still had ~105 RNA copies/mL and copies/swab present in BAL and NS, respectively. This

373

contrasts with the more rapid and complete reduction of viral replication following challenge

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.21.445189; this version posted May 24, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

374

with the WA-1 strain33,37,39,44,56,57 and higher than viral load typically seen in human infections.

375

Whether the amount and persistence of the B.1351 virus in vivo in this study relates to the

376

challenge dose or suggests that this variant has inherent properties that make it more difficult to

377

control and clear compared to the WA-1 strain is a focus of ongoing analyses.

378

The dose of B.1351 used here provided a stringent challenge for vaccine-elicited protection.

379

Nonetheless, there was a significant reduction in viral replication in BAL at day 2 post-challenge

380

in the groups that received 30 and 100 µg twice; 6 of 8 NHP that received the clinically relevant

381

100 µg vaccine regimen had no detectable sgRNA_E in BAL. Of note, while there was no

382

detectable serum neutralizing activity against B.1351 virus with a single immunization of 30 µg,

383

there was still significant reduction in viral replication in BAL by day 4 post-challenge compared

384

to controls with limited inflammation or viral antigen in the lungs at day 7. These data are

385

consistent with our recent study in which NHP immunized with only 1 or 3 µg of mRNA-1273

386

twice demonstrated a reduction in viral replication in BAL and limited lung pathology following

387

WA-1 challenge despite absence of detectable neutralizing activity38. There are several potential

388

mechanisms for lower airway protection in the absence of detectable serum neutralizing

389

antibodies. First, binding antibodies could mediate viral reduction through various Fc effector

390

functions in the BAL as has been suggested as a mechanism for protection from vaccine-induced

391

polyclonal serum60,61 and certain monoclonal antibodies62,63. Second, vaccine-primed anamnestic

392

responses in the BAL in the first week post-challenge may enhance control of infection38,44.

393

Third, current in vitro assays may not be sensitive enough to detect the full spectrum of in vivo

394

neutralization activity, that may be present in vivo. Last, while it is possible that T cells are

395

contributing to control of viral replication in the lower airway, there is no current evidence for

396

this following vaccination or primary infection64 in the NHP model.

397

In contrast to protection observed in the lower airway against the B.1.351 challenge, there was

398

more limited control of viral replication in the upper airway except in NHP that received 2 doses

399

of 100 µg. These data are consistent with prior studies in NHP showing that a higher amount of

400

antibody is required for reduction of viral replication in the upper airway than the lower airway

401

following mRNA-1273 vaccination33,38. Moreover, recent results from human vaccine trials

402

show that there is greater protection against severe disease than mild disease against the B.1.351

403

variant following immunization with Ad26.CoV229 or BNT162b232.

404

Serum antibody levels were strong predictors of reduction of viral load in BAL and NS. These

405

data are consistent with studies by us and others showing that antibodies can be a mechanistic

406

correlate of protection in NHP following vaccination38 or infection64. The correlation is most

407

robust between S-specific IgG and BAL sgRNA; our modeling suggests that animals with S-

408

specific IgG levels of approximately 100 IU/mL display sgRNA levels in BAL of approximately

409

2 log10 lower than the control animals, with a further decrease of approximately 2 log10 sgRNA

410

for every 1 log10 increase in IgG IU/mL. We also noted that 13/14 animals with any detectable

411

neutralizing antibodies against B.1.351 had BAL sgRNA_N <105. Note that no virus was

412

culturable from BAL of any NHP with BAL sgRNA_N <1.2x104 RNA copies/mL. These data

413

suggest that even for vaccines that elicit low to undetectable B.1.351-specific neutralizing

414

antibodies, there can still be control of viral replication in the lower airway.

415

The NHP model has been critical for guiding vaccine development against COVID-19 in

416

humans. This report provides evidence that the current two-dose regimen with mRNA-1273 is

417

important for inducing higher neutralizing antibody responses, CD4 and CD8 T cell immunity

418

and protection from viral replication in the lower and upper airways. The durability of immune

419

responses and protection will likely be related to maintaining a combination of serum antibody

420

and memory B cells that can rapidly respond to a new virus exposure. Moreover, immunity

421

against B.1.351 or other variants of concern can be assessed by comparing reduction in

422

neutralizing activity relative to D614G over time43. Ongoing studies are assessing how additional

423

boosting with spike antigens based on WA-1 or variant strains will influence immunity and

424

protection against B.1351 and other emerging variants in this model and in humans.

before challenge, were assessed for SARS-CoV-2 USA/Washington1 (WA-1) (A-B) and B.1.351 (C-D) Sspecific (A, C) and RBD-specific (B, D) IgG by MULTI-ARRAY ELISA, SARS-CoV-2 D614G and B.1.351
lentiviral-based pseudovirus neutralization (E), VSV-based pseudovirus neutralization (F), and focus reduction
neutralization (G). BAL (H-I, L-M) and nasal washes (J-K, N-O) collected at week 7 were assessed for SARSCoV-2 WA-1 (H, J, L, N) and B.1.351 (I, K, M, O) S-specific IgG (H-K) and IgA (L-O) by MULTI-ARRAY
ELISA. (A-D, H-O) Circles represent individual NHP. Boxes and horizontal bars denote the IQR and medians,
respectively; whisker end points are equal to the maximum and minimum values. (E-G) Gray lines represent
individual NHP, and colored lines represent geometric mean titers (GMT). Dotted lines indicate neutralization
assay limits of detection. Symbols represent individual NHP and may overlap for equal values.

Figure 3. Efficacy of mRNA-1273 against upper and lower respiratory B.1.351 viral replication. Rhesus
macaques were immunized and challenged as described in Figure S1. BAL (A, C) and nasal swabs (NS) (B, D)
were collected on days 2 (circles), 4 (squares), and 7 (triangles), and 14 (inverted triangles) post-challenge,
where applicable, and viral replication was assessed by detection of SARS-CoV-2 E- (A-B) and N-specific (CD) sgRNA. (E) Viral titers were assessed by TCID50 assay for BAL collected on days 2 and 4 post-challenge.
