Abstract​
COVID-19 outbreak is the biggest threat to human health in recent history. Currently, there are over
1.5 million related deaths and 75 million people infected around the world (as of 22/12/2020). The
identification of virulence factors which determine disease susceptibility and severity in different cell
types remains an essential challenge. The serine protease ​TMPRSS2 has been shown to be
important for S protein priming and viral entry, however, little is known about its regulation. ​SPINT2 is

a member of the family of Kunitz type serine protease inhibitors and has been shown to inhibit
TMPRSS2​. Here, we explored the existence of a co-regulation between ​SPINT2​/​TMPRSS2 and found

a tightly regulated protease/inhibitor expression balance across tissues. We found that ​SPINT2
negatively correlates with SARS-CoV-2 expression in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cell lines and was
down-regulated in secretory cells from COVID-19 patients. We validated our findings using Calu-3 cell
lines and observed a strong increase in viral load after ​SPINT2 knockdown. Additionally, we evaluated
the expression of ​SPINT2 in datasets from comorbid diseases using bulk and scRNA-seq data. We

observed its down-regulation in colon, kidney and liver tumors as well as in alpha pancreatic islets
cells from diabetes Type 2 patients, which could have implications for the observed comorbidities in
COVID-19 patients suffering from chronic diseases.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 entry requires a two-step process: first, the envelope protein spike (S) binds to the viral
cellular receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) membrane protein 1​ and is then

proteolytically activated by cellular serine proteases like TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and Furin 2–4​
​ .

TMPRSS2 has been proposed as a putative drug target 3,5,6
​
and as a biomarker for COVID19 disease
severity 7,8​
​ . Despite its central role, the regulation of ​TMPRSS2 is poorly understood, although its

activation by androgen response elements has been documented in normal and tumor prostate
tissues ​9​.

SPINT2​, ​a member of the Kunitz-type serine proteases inhibitors 10
​ has been shown to inhibit

TMPRSS2 protease activity 11,12
​
which could have implications for COVID-19 disease. A

down-regulation of ​SPINT1​, ​SPINT2 and ​SERPINA1 has been reported in colorectal Caco-2 cells

infected with SARS-CoV-2 13​
​ , however, a clear association between ​SPINT2 activation and viral

permissivity has not been confirmed. To fill this gap, we evaluated the existence of coregulation
between ​SPINT2​/​TMPRSS2 and found common transcription factors (TF) associated with genomic
loci for both genes which was also in line with a consistent correlation of the genes across cell types.

This coregulation suggested a modulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by ​SPINT2​. We could corroborate

​ ene expression and SARS-CoV-2 viral load in Calu-3 and
a negative correlation between ​SPINT2 g
Caco-2 cell lines. To validate our findings we knocked-down ​SPINT2 in Calu-3 and observed an

increase in the number of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. We hypothesized that ​SPINT2 levels would be
lower in SARS-CoV-2 target cells from COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms which we could
indeed observe in secretory cells from nasopharynx samples. This suggests that ​SPINT2 can be

used as a biomarker for disease susceptibility. Finally, it is known that ​SPINT2 is down-regulated
among different types of tumors 14
​ and we were able to corroborate this by systematically evaluating

bulk- and scRNA-seq datasets which suggest a possible association to the COVID-19 comorbidity
observed in cancer patients.

Results and Discussions

SPINT2​ and ​TMPRSS2 are coregulated across tissues
​
. We investigated
TMPRSS2 ​proteolytic activity inhibition by ​SPINT2 ​has been previously reported 11,12​

a coregulation between ​SPINT2 and ​TMPRSS2​, as a similar shared regulation through the

transcription factor (TF) ​CDX2 has been described for ​SPINT1 and ​ST14 (​Matriptase​) previously in

enterocytes 15​
​ . Since ​SPINT2 is also able to regulate ​ST14 activity in small and large intestines 16
​ we

decided to use enterocytes as a model to test this hypothesis. In order to find common TFs regulators
of ​SPINT2/​ ​TMPRSS2 we performed two independent analysis: ​i​) A footprinting analysis of chromatin
open regions using ATAC-seq data from Human Intestinal Organoids 17
​ identifying potential TF
​ we calculated the activity
binding sites and ​ii​) Using scRNA-seq data from ileum derived organoids 18

of transcription factors based on the gene expression of their targets using the SCENIC
algorithm 19​
​ . TF activities were then correlated to ​SPINT2 and ​TMPRSS2 gene expression. We
identified common TFs inferred to be bound to the open chromatin sites in the ​SPINT2 and ​TMPRSS2

genomic loci (​Figure 1A​, top and bottom, respectively) and those with TF activities positively

correlated to both ​SPINT2 and ​TMPRSS2 gene expression (​Figure 1B​, top right quadrant).

Comparing these two sets of TFs, we found ten shared regulators: ​ELF3,​ ​FOS​, ​FOSL1​, ​FOXC1​,

IRF1​, ​IRF7​, ​JUND,​ ​JUNB​, ​ONECUT3 and ​KLF4​. Interestingly, many of these regulators play a role in
immune response upon infection, suggesting a possible feedback mechanism. SARS-CoV-2 infection

has been shown to upregulate ​FOS expression in Huh7.5 and A549 cell lines 20​
​ . ​IRF1 and ​IRF7 are
interferon regulatory factors which regulate infection responses, and have been observed to be
upregulated in COVID-19 patients 21​
​ . ​JUNB has been found in SARS-CoV-2 infection gene expression

signatures in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cell lines 22​
​ . ​ELF3 is an important factor controlling the development

enterocytes​, h

On the other hand,

down-regulation of TMPRSS2 enzymatic activity by SPINT2 possibly maintains viral load at a low
level. In line with this, we observed that the expression of ​SPINT2 and ​TMPRSS2 are positively

correlated across normal human tissues (​Figure 1D​). Interestingly, tissues which have been shown to

be targets for the virus display the highest correlation between ​SPINT2 and ​TMPRSS2 expression.

Also, at single cell resolution, we observed that both genes are specifically co-expressed in many cell
types ​25​ (​Figure 1E​) which corroborates the inferred coregulation.

Deriving a SARS-CoV-2 permissivity signature
Given the previous observed association between ​SPINT2 and ​TMPRSS2​, a major SARS-CoV-2

virulence factor 3​​ , we asked whether ​SPINT2 could account for differences in viral permissivity. Calu-3

and H1299 cells have been previously reported as SARS-CoV-2 permissive and non-permissive cell
lines, respectively 22​
​ . To that end, we inferred a SARS-CoV-2 permissivity signature using the
following approach: we calculated Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) between non-infected
Calu-3 and H1299 cells (set ​z in ​Figure 2A​). Then, from this list we excluded any genes that might be
related to immune responses, even in mock-infected cells. In order to do so, we calculated DEGs
between the infected ​vs mock-infected cells from both Calu-3 (​x​) and H1299 cell lines (​y​) and then

filtered out these genes from ​z ​to obtain non-viral inducible genes (i’) (​Figure 2A​). Using this

approach, we identified a set of 480 candidate genes which might contribute to infection permissivity
(see ​Supplementary Table 1​). We used normalized expression values for these 480 genes as input
to train a Random Forest (RF) model for predicting the cumulative sum of viral gene expression in
Calu-3 infected cells (​Figure 2B​). We then used the top 25% ranked genes for further analysis.

SPINT2 was found among the top ranked genes (​Figure 2B​). Of the top ranked genes, 21
corresponded to genes with functional annotations related to viral infection (​Figure 2B inset pie chart,
Supplementary Table 1​), four have been reported to participate and/or interact directly with
SARS-CoV-2 26​
​ , eight corresponded to curated receptors 27
​ or ligands in the CellPhone Data Base 28
​

and 13 are cell membrane surface proteins. Importantly, by intersecting the set of genes in the
permissivity signature with a reported SARS-CoV-2 viral infection transcriptional signature 29​
​ , we only

found 3 hits (​CXCL5​, ​LGALS3BP and ​EHF​), confirming that most of the identified genes in our

permissivity signature are not viral-induced, but likely represent ​a priori susceptibility factors. W
​ e
found the following Heat Shock Proteins (HSP): ​HSPB1,​ ​HSPA8 and ​HSPD1 to be differentially

expressed. In a previous study a different HSP, ​HSP90, was observed to correlate to SARS-CoV-2

viral load in Calu-3 cells and its inhibition reduced viral infection 22​
​ . We also found several ribosomal

proteins (​RPL9​, ​RPL23​, ​RPL26​, ​RPL28​, ​RPL38​, ​RPS7,​ ​RPS12 and ​RPS27A​) and elongation factors

(​EIF3A,​ ​EIF4A2 and ​EIF4B​) which could be related to viral protein translation and ER stress response
30​

. In order to confirm that the permissivity signature are not just reflecting tissue specific or immune

signatures, a Pathway Enrichment Analysis (PEA) was performed using the top ranked genes.
Interestingly, we found an enrichment of host-viral interactions processes, protein stabilization and
Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) trafficking pathways (​Figure 2C​).
Next, we investigated if these susceptibility genes, identified from lung-derived cell lines, are also
expressed in other cell types. Therefore, we ranked the cell types in the Human Cell Landscape
dataset (HCL) 25​
​ based on the permissivity score derived from our top ranked genes in the
permissivity signature (​Figure 2D​) and found that stratified epithelial, basal, AT2 lung cells and

enterocytes were among the top-ranked cell types which correspond to cell types known to be
infected by the virus 31,32​
​
.
In order to further refine our permissivity signature by going beyond transcriptional levels, we used
protein expression levels of a previously released proteomic dataset from SARS-CoV-2 infected
Caco-2 cells 13​
​ . We determined the Spearman correlations of the translation rates for the top ranked

genes to that of the N and S viral proteins (​Figure 2E​). Some of the highly correlated genes (both
negative and positive) have been previously reported to participate in viral infection processes. For

example, ​LGALS3BP is a glycoprotein secreted molecule with antiviral properties observed in HIV
and Hantavirus infection 33,34
​
and in the regulation of LPS induced endotoxin shock in murine

models 35​
​ . ​CLIC1 has been previously identified as a virulence factor of Merker Cell Polyomavirus
(MCPyV) which is upregulated during infection and promotes the development of Merkel Cell
Carcinoma 36​
​ . ​HSPD1 has been shown to promote viral infection of HIV, HBV and Influenza viruses 37​
​ .
Interestingly, ​SPINT2 was consistently correlated to viral translation (​Figure 2E​). Furthermore, the

correlation of ​SPINT2 with viral gene expression is negative and this trend is consistent in both
Caco-2 and Calu-3 cell lines, indicating a repressive role on SARS-CoV-2 infection (​Supplementary
Figure 1A and ​B)​. Hence, these findings suggest that ​SPINT2 represents a permissivity factor that
negatively correlates with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SPINT2 knockdown increases viral load in Calu-3 cells
To experimentally validate ​the negative correlation of ​SPINT2 expression with SARS-CoV-2 viral gene

expression, we hypothesized that this gene could have a direct influence on SARS-CoV-2 infection by

impairing early steps of viral entry. Hence, to test our hypothesis, we knocked-down ​SPINT2 using

small-hairpins RNA in the human lung carcinoma derived line Calu-3 cells. ​SPINT2 expression was

readily detectable in wild-type (WT) Calu-3 cells. When Calu-3 cells were transduced with a specific
shRNA directed against ​SPINT2​, ​SPINT2 levels were significantly decreased compared to WT cells or

cells transduced with a scrambled shRNA (​Figure 3A​). To address the impact of ​SPINT2

knocked-down on the permissivity of Calu-3 cells to SARS-CoV-2, WT, scrambled and ​SPINT2
knocked-down cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 using the same multiplicity of infection (MOI).

Knocked-down of ​SPINT2 resulted in an almost two-fold increase in the number of cells positive for

SARS-CoV-2 (​Figure 3B​-​C​). In order to test the hypothesis whether ​SPINT2 could modulate viral

load by regulating ​TMPRSS2 expression, we monitored its fold change expression. Interestingly,
TMPRSS2 gene expression was found to be higher in ​SPINT2 knocked-down cells when compared to
WT or scramble cells (​Figure 3D​).

Together, our results show that genetic depletion of ​SPINT2

results in an increased susceptibility of Calu-3 cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is in agreement
with our analysis suggesting that ​SPINT2​ expression negatively correlates with infection.

SPINT2 is negatively correlated to viral load and is down-regulated in severe COVID-19 cases
Given the observed negative correlation between ​SPINT2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection in

cell lines (​Figure 2E​, ​Supplementary Figure 1A​, ​B​) we next investigated if ​SPINT2 expression is
associated with disease severity in COVID-19 patients. We used a publicly available scRNA-seq
dataset on nasopharynx swabs samples from patients with severe and mild symptoms 38​
​ . We
correlated a list of serine proteases and inhibitors (SPRGs, ​Supplementary Table 2​) to the viral RNA

reads and found that ​SPINT2 was the second most negatively correlated gene (​Figure 4A​). Then, we

selected the cell cluster with the highest expression of ​SPINT2​, which correspond to secretory cells

(​Supplementary Figure 2A​) and among these cells, observed a lower ​SPINT2 gene expression in
cells from critical COVID19 cases compared to moderate cases (​Figure 4B​). This finding is

particularly relevant since secretory cells are primary targets of viral infection 39​
​ . We also evaluated

data on Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) from severe COVID-19 patients ​40​. In this

dataset, ​SPINT2 was found to be strongly expressed in Dendritic Cells (DC), plasmacytoid DC (pDC),

and stem cells (SC) and eosinophils (Supplementary ​Figure 2B​). Among these cells, again, we
observed lower ​SPINT2 expression in patients from Intensive Care Units (ICU) (​Figure 4C​).

Additionally, we could also corroborate the negative correlation of ​SPINT2 and viral load using bulk
RNA-seq data from lung autopsies of COVID-19 deceased patients 41​
​ . We calculated the correlations

of gene expression between ​SPINT2​, ​ACE2 and ​TMPRSS2 to E, M, N and S viral genes and
observed the similar negative correlation (​Supplementary Figure 2C​). Collectively, this evidence

suggests that ​SPINT2​ expression level could be associated to COVID-19 disease severity.

SPINT2 is down-regulated in multiple tumor types and pancreatic cells from T2D patients
COVID-19 patients with previous records of chronic diseases like cancer or diabetes are considered
at higher risk 42–46​
​
. Also, ​SPINT2 gene silencing by promoter hypermethylation has been reported in
multiple tumor types which promotes tumor progression 14,47–49​
​
. For this reason, we hypothesized

that ​SPINT2 down-regulation in tumor cells would increase viral infection permissivity which among
others, could be one of the mechanisms behind the comorbidity observed in COVID-19 patients. We

screened lung, colon, liver and hepatic tumor datasets to evaluate the differences in ​SPINT2 gene

We

found

statistically

significant down-regulation of ​SPINT2 i​ n the kidneys and liver tumors (​Supplementary Figure 3A​).

Similarly, using comparable tumor scRNA-seq datasets 50–54
​
we observed a down-regulation of
SPINT2 in colon adenocarcinoma (epithelial cells), renal clear cell carcinoma (endothelial cells) and
hepatocellular carcinoma (hepatocytes) (​Figure 5​). Interestingly, we were able to detect ​SPINT2
down-regulation in colorectal tumor epithelial cells at single cell level but not in bulk RNA-seq data
suggesting that ​SPINT2 expression might me modulated in specific cell subtypes (​Figure 5 and

Supplementary Figure 4A​). In lung adenocarcinomas, we found ​SPINT2 upregulation in tumors both
in TCGA and scRNA-seq data which might reflect the existence of different determinants for
comorbidity in lung tissues independent of ​SPINT2 modulation. We also looked at the expression

of ​SPINT2 in pancreatic cells from diabetes type 2 (DT2) patients 54​
​ . Islet cells have high ​SPINT2

expression when compared to other cell types like endothelial cells (see ​Supplementary Figure 4B​).

We observed a strong down-regulation of ​SPINT2 in alpha-cells of DT2 patients, which have been
shown to be primary targets of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This down-regulation of the virulence
associated factor ​SPINT2​ might contribute to the comorbidity between COVD19 and DT2.

Discussion
In this study, we describe a tight protease-inhibitor/protease balance at the gene expression level
between ​SPINT2 and ​TMPRSS2, ​a major co-receptor of SARS-CoV-2. We found Transcription Factor

Binding Sites (TFBS) for ten regulators including ​IRF1​, ​IRF3​, ​JUNB​, ​JUND and ​ELF3 whose TF

activities were found to be correlated to both ​SPINT2 and ​TMPRSS2 gene expression which suggests

their possible role as common regulators of both genes. Interestingly, ​ELF3 and ​IRF7 TF activity has

been found to be modulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected vs bystander enterocytes from ileum 18​
​ , which

could point to viral load modulation mediated by ​TMPRSS2 and ​SPINT2 through these TFs. We show
that ​SPINT2 and ​TMPRSS2 gene expression levels are correlated across cell types and tissues.

Interestingly, known SARS-CoV-2 target tissues have high correlation values and co-expression for
both genes which suggest that ​SPINT2​ could play a role in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry.
Currently, it is unclear what are the molecular signatures that determine viral permissivity and how
they are related to disease severity. We inferred a SARS-CoV-2 permissivity signature, using
differentially expressed genes between permissive and non-permissive cell lines from which we
removed viral induced genes. We were able to find ​SPINT2 in this permissivity signature and
observed a negative correlation to SARS-CoV-2 viral load in Calu-3 cells. We also corroborated this
trend at the protein level in Caco-2 cells. During the preparation of these manuscript, a study from
Bojkova D et al, 2020 was published suggesting a possible role of ​SPINT1​, ​SPINT2 and ​SERPINA1 in

viral infection by observing the down-regulation of their protein levels in infected cells and also by

evaluating the effect of Aprotinin a non-specific SP inhibitor on viral load 6​​ . However, here for the first
time by knocking down ​SPINT2, we provide a direct causal evidence that ​SPINT2 is indeed able to
modulate SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SPINT2 inhibits ​TMPRSS2 enzymatic activity through its KD1 and KD2 domains 12​
​ . Interestingly, we
could observe an up-regulation of ​TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in the ​SPINT2 knocked-down Calu-3

cells. Further investigation is needed to explore this regulation at the gene expression level. Although,
it has been reported previously that ​SPINT2 can modulate ​ST14 protein activity by regulating its

shedding from the cell membrane of mouse intestinal epithelial cells 16
​ which suggest that ​SPINT2
could modulate serine proteases activity through different mechanisms. Interestingly, ​SPINT2 has
been reported to regulate transcription of certain genes like ​CDK1A via histone methylation 55​
​ . Our

findings suggest that ​SPINT2 regulates SARS-CoV-2 viral infection through the inhibition of
TMPRSS2,​ however, we cannot discard the possibility of an indirect interaction.

We found a lower expression of ​SPINT2 in secretory cells from COVID-19 patients with severe

symptoms 38​
​ . This could have implications for COVID-19 disease severity since secretory cells have

been shown to be the target of SARS-CoV viral infection using organotypic human airway epithelial
cultures 39​
​ . We found ​SPINT2 in the permissivity signature from which we filtered out viral induced
genes, suggesting that this gene could be used as a marker for predicting COVID-19 disease
susceptibility ​prior​ to infection, however this needs to be further evaluated.
Serine proteases (SPs) have been reported to be abnormally regulated in diverse chronic
diseases 14,56–58​
​
. For example, during carcinogenic development SPs influence metastasis and cancer
progression 59,60​
​
,

while in the context of diabetes they control fibrinolysis, coagulation and

inflammation which in turn affects disease severity 57​
​ . This led us to hypothesize that shared
molecular mechanisms between some chronic diseases and COVID-19 could be explained in part by
the regulation of ​SPINT2.​ We observed ​SPINT2 down-regulation in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC),

Colon

Adenocarcinoma (COAD) and

renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (rCCC) tumor cells.

​ own-regulation in liver has been reported to contribute to the development of HCC by the
SPINT2 d

binding and inhibition of the serine protease ​HGFA which transforms Hepatocyte Growth Factor
​
and
(​HGF​) into its active form which in turn promotes metastasis, cell growth and angiogenesis 14,61
the same mechanism has been suggested for rCCC 9​​ . A marked down-regulation of ​SPINT2 can be

observed in alpha islets pancreatic cells from diabetes patients. It has been reported that islet cells
can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 which could contribute to the onset of acute diabetes 62​
​ . Hence,
these results suggests that kidney, colon and liver tumor types as well as pancreatic islets cells from
diabetic patients could be more permissive and susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection due to an
imbalance

of ​SPINT2

gene

expression,

which

could

to

the

the

protease-inhibitor/protease balance ​ .
63​

In conclusion, we showed for the first time that ​SPINT2 is a permissivity factor that modulates
SARS-CoV-2 infection. This modulation could be explained by the balance of ​TMPRSS2​/​SPINT2

(serine protease/inhibitor) that we observed at the gene expression level across several tissues. We

also found lower ​SPINT2 gene expression in samples from COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms,
hence, this gene might represent a biomarker for predicting disease severity. We also found ​SPINT2
down-regulation in tumor types which could have implications for the observed comorbidities in
COVID-19 patients with cancer.

SARS-CoV-2 viral infection
The ​SARS-CoV-2 isolate used in the experiments was obtained from the swab of a SARS-CoV-2

positive patient from the Heidelberg University Hospital. The virus was isolated and propagated in

Vero E6 cells. All SARS-CoV-2 infections were performed with a multiplicity of infection of 0.04 as
determined in Vero E6 cells. Prior to infection, culture media was removed and virus was added to
cells and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. Fresh media was added back to the cells upon virus removal.
RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and qPCR
Cells were harvested 24 hours post infection for RNA isolation using RNAeasy RNA extraction kit
(Qiagen) as per manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA was synthesized using iSCRIPT
reverse transcriptase (BioRad) from 250 ng of total RNA per 20µL reaction according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR assay was performed using iTaq SYBR green
(BioRad) as per manufacturer’s instructions. The expression of target genes was normalized to
endogenous control ​TBP. ​Primer sequences are as below:

The fold change in SARS-CoV-2 genome copy number was calculated using input as a
reference. Input samples were harvested directly post-infection and accounted for the basal viral
genome copy number detected due to viruses attaching to the cell membrane.
Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay
Cells were seeded on iBIDI glass bottom 8-well chamber slides which are previously coated with
2.5% human collagen in water for at least 1 hour​. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for
20 mins at room temperature (RT) 24 hours post infection. Cells were washed in 1X PBS and
permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X for 15 mins at RT. 30 minutes of blocking were carried out using 3%
BSA-PBS at RT. M​ouse monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (NC) protein (Sino
biologicals MM05) as primary antibody was diluted in 1% BSA- phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and
incubated for 1h at RT. Cells were washed with 1X PBS three times and incubated with secondary
antibodies conjugated with ​AF488 (Molecular Probes) ​and DAPI for 30-45 mins at RT. Cells were
washed in 1X PBS three times and maintained in PBS. Cells were imaged on a Nikon/Andor Spinning
Disc Confocal microscope to quantify the number of infected cells relative to the number of nuclei.

Statistics and computational analyses and statistics
In order to quantify infected cells from indirect immunofluorescent stained samples, ilastik 1.2.0 was
used on DAPI images to generate a mask representing each nucleus as an individual object. These
masks were used on CellProfiler 3.1.9 to measure the intensity of the conjugated secondary
antibodies in each nucleus. A threshold was set based on the basal fluorescence of non infected
samples, and all nuclei with a higher fluorescence were considered infected cells.
Calu-3 and 1299 cells preprocessing
For Calu-3 cells we filter out cells with an extremely high number of detected genes (>50,000) which
probably corresponds to doublets. In H1299, since few cells were detected to be infected, because
this line is non-permissive, in order to obtain DEGs we defined infected cells as those with cumulative
sum of viral genes expression >0 .

​Assessing non-viral induced permissivity signatures
As we wanted to differentiate between permissivity and infection signatures, we first looked for
differentially expressed genes in SARS-CoV-2 permissive ​vs non-permissive cell lines and then we

removed all the genes which were up- or down-regulated during infection (​Figure 2A​). We performed

Differential Expression Analysis using Seurat 65
​ (DEA) between Calu-3 and H1299 cells in
non-infected mock cells at 4 hours of culture (​z​). Then, we obtained DEGs of Calu-3 infected ​vs mock

at 12 hours post infection (​x​); we did the same with H1299 infected cells ​vs​ mock-infected cells at

4 hpi (​y​) In all DEA we set a Log Fold Change (FC)=0.25 threshold. Finally, we removed these
infection signatures from the DEGs of Calu-3 ​vs​ H1299 to obtain the permissivity gene signature (​i’)​ .

Ranking genes using RF and Pathway Enrichment Analysis
A Random Forest (RF) regression analysis was performed using the normalized gene expression of
the permissivity signature to predict the cumulative sum of the expression of viral genes in Calu-3
cells at 12 hpi. We trained the RF using a random subsample of 75% and tested the results with the
remaining set. Next, we estimated the feature importance for each of the permissivity signature genes
and performed enrichment analysis using enrichR 66​
​ on the top 25% ranked genes.
Scoring permissivity signatures
For the scoring of cells based on the permissivity signature among cell types in the HCL dataset, we
used the top 25% RF ranked genes and applied the AddModuleScore function of Seurat setting
nbin​=100.
SPINT2 expression correlation to viral gene expression
For the translatome correlation analysis, the summed intensity normalized values were used as
provided in the study 13​
​ . In order to compute the correlations of SPRGs (​Supplementary Table 2​) to
the viral reads in the scRNA-seq data from Chua RL et al, 2020 the raw count matrices were

extracted from the Seurat object provided by the authors, splitted by sample and then imputed using
scimpute 67
​ with the following parameters: drop_thr=0.5 and Kcluster equal to the number of
annotated cell types in each matrix. The imputed matrices were then merged and log2 normalized.
Finally, correlations were performed restricted to infected cells (viral read counts>0). In the bulk
RNA-seq data from deceased COVID-19 patients log2 RPM of normalized counts are used. In both
cases correlation to viral genes were carried out using spearman coefficients.
scRNA-seq data preprocessing
In order to have a standardized workflow for the processing of scRNA-seq data we used SCT
normalization using the Seurat workflow for every dataset except for Human Cell Landscape data
where log2 normalization and scaling were performed since this dataset is large and using SCT was
unpractical. HCC data were downloaded from GEO (GSE149614) and reprocessed. We used the
Louvain method implemented in Seurat for community detection and clusters were identified by using
tissue markers.

We used the markers used to characterize cell types from an independent

scRNA-seq human liver atlas 68
​ and using these markers identified clusters of epithelial, endothelial,

hepatocytes, Kupffer and NK cells (​Supplementary Figure 3B​). For kidney, colon, prostate tumors,

pancreatic cells from T2D, PBMC and Airways epithelium from SARS-CoV-2 patients’s datasets and
the annotations were used as provided in the corresponding publications (see data availability
section).

Inference of Transcription Binding Sites
A footprinting analysis was carried out using the TOBIAS pipeline 69
​ with a default parameters setting
of MACS –nomodel –shift -100 –extsize 200 –broad. Then, we extracted the inferred Transcription
Factor Binding Sites (TFBS) for those TF with activities found to be positively correlated to both
SPINT2 and ​TMPRSS2 using the single cell RNA-seq data. TFBS were visualised using the

PlotTracks TOBIAS function and the network was built in Cytoscape 70​
​ . Edges in the network

represent TF binding scores.
