Summary

56
57

Terminating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic relies upon pan-global vaccination. Current vaccines

58

elicit neutralizing antibody responses to the virus spike derived from early isolates. However,

59

new strains have emerged with multiple mutations: P.1 from Brazil, B.1.351 from South Africa

60

and B.1.1.7 from the UK (12, 10 and 9 changes in the spike respectively). All have mutations

61

in the ACE2 binding site with P.1 and B.1.351 having a virtually identical triplet: E484K,

62

K417N/T and N501Y, which we show confer similar increased affinity for ACE2. We show

63

that, surprisingly, P.1 is significantly less resistant to naturally acquired or vaccine induced

64

antibody responses than B.1.351 suggesting that changes outside the RBD impact

65

neutralisation. Monoclonal antibody 222 neutralises all three variants despite interacting with

66

two of the ACE2 binding site mutations, we explain this through structural analysis and use

67

the 222 light chain to largely restore neutralization potency to a major class of public

68

antibodies.

Introduction

71
72

For more than a year SARS-CoV-2 has caused enormous global dislocation, leading to more

73

than 2.5 million deaths (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus Accessed: 2021-03-01)

74

and leaving no country untouched. Successive waves of infection have led to the imposition of

75

draconian lock downs in many countries resulting in severe economic and societal disruption

76

(Donthu and Gustafsson, 2020).

77
78

Enormous investment has been made in vaccine development with hundreds of vaccine

79

candidates in different stages of development using an array of different platforms from RNA,

80

viral vectors, recombinant protein and inactivated (Krammer, 2020). Five vaccines have now

81

been through large scale phase III trials and have demonstrated safety and efficacy (Polack et

82

al., 2020;Voysey et al., 2020;Baden et al., 2020). Four of these, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech;

83

mRNA), mRNA-1273 (Moderna; mRNA), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) (Oxford-

84

AstraZeneca; chimpanzee adenoviral vectored) and Ad26.COV2-S (Janssen; adenovirus

85

serotype 26 vectored) have received emergency use authorization (EUA) in a variety of

86

countries and are being rolled out at massive scale and NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax; recombinant

87

protein) has also shown impressive efficacy and is likely to achieve EUA in the near future

88

(https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/944933 Accessed: 2021-03-01). All of these vaccines

89

have been designed to raise antibodies (and T-cells) to spike protein (S) and because of the

90

speed of development they all include S sequences derived from the first reported sequence

91

from Wuhan in January 2020 (Lu et al., 2020).

92
93

SARS-CoV-2 like all RNA viruses has an error prone RNA polymerase, and despite some error

94

correction, progressive accrual of mutational changes is inevitable. The massive scale of the

95

pandemic which is largely uncontrolled leads to huge levels of viral replication, increasing the

96

chances that adaptive mutations will occur. There are many possible ways whereby a mutation

97

in SARS-CoV-2 may give the virus a selective advantage, however concentrating on mutation

98

in S, there are two clear possibilities: increased efficiency of transmission and escape from

99

neutralizing antibodies (Volz et al., 2021).

100
101

The S protein is a large Type-1 transmembrane glycoprotein which assembles into homo-

102

trimers (Walls et al., 2020), which form most of the outer surface of coronaviruses. S is divided

103

into two portions S1 and S2 which are cleaved by proteolysis. S1 is responsible for target cell

104

engagement, whilst S2 completes membrane fusion allowing the viral RNA access to the host

105

cell cytoplasm where viral replication can begin. S1 contains an N terminal domain (NTD) and

106

receptor binding domain (RBD).

107
108

The RBD interacts with the cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) which

109

is expressed on diverse cell types, including cells in the upper and lower respiratory tracts,

110

allowing SARS-CoV-2 to cause respiratory infection. The ACE2 interaction surface is a small

111

25 amino acid patch at the apex of spike, presented to ACE2 when the RBD swings upwards

112

(Hoffmann et al., 2020;Shang et al., 2020) and it is mutations in this region that are causing the

113

most concern. Three multiply mutated viral strains appeared independently at the end of 2020

114

in different regions where they rapidly expanded to become the dominant strains

115

(https://www.cogconsortium.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Report-2_COG-UK_SARS-

116

CoV-2-Mutations.pdf). It is not clear how these strains acquired so many changes without clear

117

intermediate variants. It has however been speculated, with some evidence, that they may have

118

evolved in immunosuppressed chronically infected patients (Kemp et al., 2021) who support

119

high levels of viral replication for months and may be treated with immune plasma or

120

monoclonal antibodies which may drive selection of variants displaying mutations that evade

121

antibody responses.

122
123

Of most concern are changes in the RBD. P.1 has three: K417T, E484K and N501Y, B.1.351

124

also has three: K417N, E484K and N501Y whereas, B.1.1.7 contains the single N501Y

125

mutation. All of these changes have the potential to modulate ACE2/RBD affinity potentially

126

leading to increased transmissibility, for which there is now good evidence in B.1.1.7. In

127

addition, these mutated residues also have the potential to modulate neutralization of SARS-

128

CoV-2 by naturally or vaccine induced antibody responses.

130

In this paper we examine an isolate of P.1 cultured from a throat swab taken from an infected

131

patient in Manaus, Brazil in December 2020 and compare its interactions with serum and

132

antibodies with those of three other viruses, an early isolate, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. We test the

133

ability of immune sera induced by infection with early strains of SARS-CoV-2 (Dejnirattisai

134

et al., 2021), or by vaccination with the Oxford-AstraZenca or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines to

135

neutralize P.1 (Supasa et al., 2021;Zhou et al., 2021). We see a reduction in the neutralizing

136

capacity of immune serum to P.1 similar to the reduction seen with B.1.1.7, but not as severe

137

as that seen with B.1.351 (Zhou et al., 2021). We demonstrate an increased affinity of P.1 RBD

138

for ACE2 and investigate the structural basis of this through crystallography. We also study

139

neutralization by a panel of potent monoclonal antibodies which block RBD/ACE2 interaction

140

and provide a crystallographic solution of how one potent antibody, mAb 222, of the panel

141

(Dejnirattisai et al., 2021) which contacts both K417 and N501, is resistant to the 501Y and

142

417T/N mutations found in the P.1/B1.351 strains. We dissect the basis for this via a series of

143

high resolution structures of RDB-Fab complexes and based on this restore neutralization of

144

certain antibodies by swapping the light chain. Finally, we bring together data on P.1, B.1.351

145

and B.1.1.7 and attempt to interpret the different effects these have upon the neutralizing

146

capacity of serum generated to early SARS-CoV-2 strains.

Results

150

The P.1 lineage

151

P.1 was first reported in December 2020 from Manaus in Amazonas province of Northern

152

Brazil (Faria et al., 2021). A large first wave of infection was seen in Manaus in March-June

153

2020 and by October around 75% of individuals from the region are estimated to have been

154

infected, representing a very high attack rate. A second large wave of infection began in

155

December 2020 leading to further hospitalizations. This second wave corresponded with the

156

rapid emergence of P.1, not seen before December when it was found in 52% of cases, rising

157

to 85% by January 2021 (Figure S1).

158
159

P.1 contains multiple changes compared to B.1.1.28 and P.2 which had been previously

160

circulating in Brazil (Faria et al., 2021). Compared to the Wuhan sequence P.1 contains the

161

following mutations: L18F, T20N, P26S, D138Y, R190S in the NTD, K417T, E484K, N501Y

162

in the RBD, D614G and H655Y at the C-terminus of S1 and T1027I, V1176F in S2. The

163

position of the changes seen in P.1 compared with those found in B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 together

164

with a representation on where they occur on the full spike protein and RBD are shown in

165

Figure 1. Mutations K417T, E484K, N501Y in the ACE2 interacting surface are of the greatest

166

concern because of their potential to promote escape from the neutralizing antibody response

167

which predominately targets this region (Figure 1D) (Dejnirattisai et al., 2021). We searched

168

the COVID-19 genomics UK (COG-UK) (Tatusov et al., 2000) and the global initiative on

169

sharing avian influenza data (GISAID) (https://www.gisaid.org) databases. A small number

170

of sequences including the K417T mutation, inclusive of the P.1 lineage, have been observed

171

in sequencing from Japan, France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Colombia (Figure S1).

172
173

It is noteworthy that P.1, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 have accrued multiple mutations in the NTD, in

174

B.1.1.7 there are two deletions D69-70 and D144, in B.1.351 four amino acid changes and the

175

D242-244 deletion, while in P.1 there are 6 amino acid changes in the NTD but no deletions.

176

Of note, two of the NTD changes in P.1 introduce N-linked glycosylation sequons T20N (TRT

177

to NRT) and R190S (NLR to NLS, Figure 1E). The NTD, in the absence of these changes,

178

reasonably well populated with glycosylation sites, indeed it has been suggested that a single

179

bare patch surrounded by N-linked glycans glycans attached at N17, N74, N122, and N149

180

defines a ‘supersite’ limiting where neutralizing antibodies can attach to the NTD (Cerutti et

181

al., 2021). Residue 188 is somewhat occluded whereas residue 20 is highly exposed, is close

182

to the site of attachment of neutralizing antibody 159 (Dejnirattisai et al., 2021) and impinges

183

on the proposed NTD supersite.

184
185

The effects of RBD mutations on ACE2 affinity.

186

We have previously measured the affinity of RBD/ACE2 interaction for Wuhan, B.1.1.7

187

(N501Y) and B.1.351 (K417N, E484K, N501Y) RBDs. N501Y increased affinity 7-fold and

188

the combination of 417, 484 and 501 mutations further increased affinity (19-fold compared to

189

Wuhan). Here we have expressed P.1 RBD (K417T, E484K, N501Y). The KD for the

190

P.1/ACE2 interaction is 4.8 nM with Kon=1.08E5/Ms, Koff=5.18E-4/s (Figure S2, Methods),

191

showing that binding to P.1 is essentially indistinguishable from B.1.351 (4.0 nM).

192
193

To better understand RBD-ACE2 interactions we determined the crystal structure of the RBD-

194

ACE2 complex at 3.1 Å resolution (Methods, Table S1). As expected the mode of RBD-ACE2

195

engagement is essentially identical for P.1 and the original Wuhan RBD sequence (Figure

196

2A). The RMS deviation between the 791 Ca positions is 0.4 Å, similar to the experimental

197

error in the coordinates, and the local structure around each of the three mutations is conserved.

198

Nevertheless, calculation of the electrostatic potential of the contact surfaces reveals a marked

199

change, with much greater complementarity for the P.1 RBD consistent with higher affinity.

200

(Figure 2B,C,D).

201
202

Residue 417 lies at the back of the RBD neck (our RBD anatomy follows Dejnirattisai et al.,

203

2021) and in the original SARS-CoV-2 is a lysine residue which forms a salt-bridge with D30

204

of ACE2 (Figure 2E). The threonine of P.1 RBD no longer forms this interaction and the gap

205

created is open to solvent, so there is no obvious reason why the mutation would increase

206

affinity for ACE2, and this is consistent with directed evolution studies (Zahradník et al., 2021)

207

where this mutation was rarely selected in RBDs with increased affinity for ACE2.

208
209

Residue 484 lies atop the left shoulder of the RBD and neither the original Glu nor the Lys of

210

P1 make significant contact with ACE2, nevertheless the marked change in charge

211

substantially improves the electrostatic complementarity (Figure 2F,G), consistent with

212

increased affinity.

213
214

Residue 501 lies on the right shoulder of the RBD and the change from a relatively short Asn

215

sidechain to the large aromatic Tyr allows for favourable ring stacking interactions consistent

216

with increased affinity (Figure 2H).

217
218

Binding of P.1 RBD by potent human monoclonal antibodies

219

We have previously described a large panel of monoclonal antibodies generated from patients

220

infected with early strains of SARS-CoV-2, before the emergence of B.1.1.7 (Dejnirattisai et

221

al., 2021). From this panel we have selected 20 potent antibodies which have focus reduction

222

neutralization 50% (FRNT50) values <100ng/ml, 19 of these mAbs have an epitope on the

223

RBD and all of these block ACE2/RBD interaction, whilst mAb 159 binds the NTD. We used

224

biolayer interferometry (BLI) to measure the affinity of the RBD-binding antibodies and found

225

that compared to Victoria (SARS-CoV-2/human/AUS/VIC01/2020), an early isolate of SARS-

226

CoV-2, which has a single change S247R in S compared to the Wuhan strain (Seemann et al.,

227

2020; Caly et al., 2020) monoclonal antibody binding was significantly impacted with a

228

number showing complete knock-out of activity (Figure 2I). The results with P.1 showed a

229

greater impact compared to B.1.1.7 but similar to B.1.351 (Zhou et al., 2021), this is expected

230

since both contain mutation of the same 3 residues in the RBD, only differing at position 417,

231

K417N in B.1.351 and K417T in P.1. The localization of the impact on binding is shown in

232

Figure 2J and reflects direct interaction with mutated residues. Of note is mAb 222 which

233

maintains binding potency across all variants despite adjacency to mutated residues, as

234

discussed below.

235
236

Neutralization of P.1 by potent human monoclonal antibodies

237

Using the same set of 20 potent antibodies neutralization was measured by a focus reduction

238

neutralization test (FRNT) and compared with neutralization of Victoria and variants B.1.1.7

239

and B.1.351. Compared to Victoria neutralization by the monoclonal antibodies was

240

significantly impacted by P.1, with 12/20 showing >10-fold reduction in FRNT50 titre and a

241

number showing complete knock out of activity (Figure 3A Table S2). The results with P.1

242

showed a greater impact compared to B.1.1.7 but were as expected similar to those with

243

B.1.351 (Zhou et al., 2021). There is good correlation between the negative impact on

244

neutralization and on RBD-affinity (Figure 2J).

245
246

Reduced neutralization of P.1 by monoclonal antibodies being developed for clinical use.

247

A number of potent neutralizing antibodies are being developed for clinical use either

248

therapeutically of prophylactically (Ku et al., 2021;Baum et al., 2020;Kemp et al., 2021). We

249

performed neutralization assays against P.1 using antibodies S309 Vir (Pinto et al., 2020),

250

AZD8895, AZD1061 and AZ7442 (a combination of AZD8895 and AZD1061) AstraZeneca,

251

REGN10987 and REGN10933 Regeneron, LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV16 Lilly and ADG10,

252

ADG20 and ADG30 from Adagio (Figure 3B). The affinity of binding to P.1 RBD was also

253

investigated by BLI for the Regeneron and AstraZeneca antibodies and the results (Figure 2I)

254

parallel closely the neutralization results. Neutralization of both Lilly antibodies was severely

255

impacted with LY-CoV16 and LY-CoV555 showing almost complete loss of neutralization of

256

P.1 and B.1.351 while LY-CoV16 also showed marked reduction in neutralization of B.1.1.7.

257

There was also escape from neutralization of P.1 by REGN10933 and a modest reduction in

258

neutralization of P.1 by AZD8895, while AZD1061 and AZD 7442 showed equal

259

neutralization of all SARS-CoV-2 variants. The three Adagio antibodies neutralized all variants

260

with all reaching a plateau at 100% neutralization and interestingly, ADG30 showed a slight

261

increase of neutralization of P.1. S309 Vir was largely unaffected although for several viruses,

262

including P.1, the antibody failed to completely neutralize, conceivably reflecting incomplete

263

glycosylation at N343, since the sugar interaction is key to binding of this antibody N343 (Pinto

264

et al., 2020). The escape from REGN10933 and LY-CoV555 mirrors that of other potent

265

antibodies (including 316 and 384 in our set) which make strong interactions with residues

266

484-486 and are severely compromised by the marked change E484K, whereas LY-CoV016,

267

an IGHV3-53 mAb, is affected by changes at 417 and 501. The abrogation of the Lilly Ly-

268

CoV-16 and LyCoV-555 antibodies reflects the observation of Starr et al. (Starr et al.,

269

2021)(Greaney et al., 2021) that LY-CoV555 is sensitive to mutation at residue 384 and LY-

270

CoV16 is sensitive to changes at 417.

271
272

Reduced neutralization by an NTD-binding antibody

273

The neutralization titre of NTD-binding mAb159, was 133-fold reduced on P.1 compared to

274

Victoria with only 64% neutralization at 10µg/ml (Figures 3A). Although P.1 does not harbor

275

deletions in the NTD like B.1.1.7 (D69-70, D144) or B.1.351 (D242-244), it is clear that the 6

276

NTD mutations in P.1 (L18F, T20N, P26S, D138Y, R190S) disrupt the epitope for mAb159

277

(Figure 4A) (Dejnirattisai et al., 2021;Supasa et al., 2021). It is possible that the failure of this

278

antibody to achieve complete neutralization could be due to partial glycosylation at residue 20,

279

which is some 16 Å from bound Fab 159, however the L18F mutation is even closer and likely

280

to diminish affinity (Figure 4A). Since it has been proposed that there is a single supersite for

281

potent NTD binding antibodies we would expect the binding of many of these to be affected

282

(Cerutti et al., 2021).

283
284

Reduced neutralization by VH3-53 public antibodies

285

Five of the potent monoclonal antibodies used in this study (150, 158, 175, 222 and 269),

286

belong to the VH3-53 family and a further 2 (out of 5 of this family) belong to the almost

287

identical VH3-66, and the following discussion applies also to these antibodies. The binding

288

sites for these have been described (Dejnirattisai et al., 2021). The large majority of these

289

antibodies attach to the RBD in a very similar fashion. These motifs recur widely, VH3-53 are

290

the most prevalent deposited sequences and structures for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing

291

antibodies. Their engagement with the RBD is dictated by CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 whilst the

292

CDR-H3 is characteristically short and makes rather few interactions (Yuan et al., 2020; Barnes

293

et al., 2020;Dejnirattisai et al., 2021). We have previously solved the structures of mAbs 150,

294

158 and 269 (Figure 4B) which show that whilst there are no contacts with residue 484, there

295

are interactions of CDR-H3 with K417 and CDR-L1 with N501, meaning that binding and

296

neutralization by VH3-53 antibodies would be predicted to be compromised by the N501Y

297

change in variant viruses B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1, whilst the additional change at 417 in P.1

298

(K417T) and B.1.351 (K417N) might be expected to have an additive effect (Dejnirattisai et

299

al., 2021).

300
301

In practice, changes in the light chain and CDR-H3 between members of this family mean that

302

the story is more complex. Thus, neutralization of P.1 by 175 and 158 is severely impacted and

303

neutralization of P.1 by 269 is almost completely lost. However, for 150 P.1 neutralization is

11

304

less compromised than for B.1.351 (Zhou et al., 2021), whilst for 222 neutralization is

305

completely unaffected by the changes in P.1 and indeed all variants (Figure 3A).

306
307

We measured the affinity of 222 for both P.1 (KD = 1.92±0.01 nM) and Wuhan RBD (KD =

308

1.36±0.08 nM) showing no reduction in the strength of interaction despite the changes

309

occurring in the putative binding site for P.1 (Table S2).

310
311

To understand how 222 is able to still neutralize P.1 we solved the crystal structures of six

312

ternary complexes of 222 in complex with the RBDs for (i) the original virus, and bearing

313

mutations (ii) K417N; (iii) K417T; (iv) N501Y; the 417, 484 and 501 changes characteristic

314

of B.1.351 (v) and P.1 (vi). All crystals also contained a further Fab, EY6A as a crystallization

315

chaperone (Zhou et al., 2020), were isomorphous and the resolution of the structures ranged

316

from 1.95 to 2.67 Å, Figure 4C,D, Methods, Table S1. As expected, the structures are highly

317

similar with the binding pose of 222 being essentially identical in all structures (pairwise

318

RMSD in Ca atoms between pairs of structures are ~0.2-0.3 Å for all residues in the RBD and

319

Fv region of mAb 222, Figure 4D).

320
321

In the original virus residue 417 makes a weak salt bridge interaction with heavy chain CDR3

322

residue E99. Mutation to either Asn or Thr abolishes this and there is little direct interaction,

323

although there are weak (~3.5 Å) contacts to heavy chain Y52 and light chain Y92 (Figure

324

4E). However, a buffer molecule/ion rearranges to form bridging interactions and this may

325

mitigate the loss of the salt bridge, in addition the original salt bridge is weak and its

326

contribution to binding may be offset by the loss of entropy in the lysine sidechain. We note

327

that CDR-H3 of 222, at 13 residues is slightly longer than found in the majority of potent VH3-

328

53 antibodies, however this seems unlikely to be responsible for the resilience of 222, rather it

12

329

seems that there is little binding energy in general from the CDR3-H3, since most of the binding

330

energy contribution of the heavy chain comes from CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 which do not

331

interact with RBD residue 417, meaning that many VH3-53 antibodies are likely to be resilient

332

to the common N/T mutations (Figure 4B).

333
334

Residue 501 makes contact with CDR-L1 of mAb 222 (Figure 4D,F), however the interaction,

335

with P30 is probably slightly strengthened by the N501Y mutation which provides a stacking

336

interaction with the proline, conferring resilience. This is in contrast to the situation with most

337

other VH3.53 antibodies where direct contacts confer susceptibility to escape by mutation to

338

Tyr (Figures 2I,J and 3A) (Supasa et al., 2021;Zhou et al., 2021).

339
340

The 222 light chain can rescue neutralization by other VH3-53 mAbs

341

Reasoning that the relative robustness of mAb 222 to common variants (P.1, B.1.1.7 and

342

B.1.351) compared to other VH3-53 antibodies stems from the choice of light chain we

343

modelled the 222LC with the heavy chains of other VH3-53 antibodies to see if they might be

344

compatible (Figure 4G). The result was striking, it appeared that there would likely be no

345

serious steric clashes. This contrasted with the numerous clashes seen when we docked the

346

light chains of other VH3-53 antibodies onto the heavy chain of 222 (Figure 4G,H). This

347

suggests that the 222 light chain might be an almost universal light chain for these 3-53

348

antibodies and could confer resilience to P.1, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. This led us to create

349

chimeric antibodies containing the 222LC combined with the HC of the other VH3-53 mAbs

350

150, 158, 175 and 269. In all cases, chimeric antibodies expressed well and we performed

351

neutralization assays against Victoria, B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 viruses (Figure 5). For B.1.1.7

352

neutralization of 150HC/222LC, 158HC/222LC and 269HC/222LC was restored to near the

353

level seen on Victoria, whilst 175HC/222LC could not fully neutralize B.1.1.7. For B.1.351

354

and P.1 the activity of mAbs 150 and 158 was restored in chimeras containing the 222LC, with

355

the 150HC/222LC showing 50-fold greater potency against B.1.351 (7ng vs 350 ng/ml) and

356

13-fold greater potency against P.1 (3ng vs 40 ng/ml) than native 150. With an FRNT50 of

357

3ng/ml 150HC/222LC was the most potent antibody tested against P.1.

358
359

Neutralization of P.1 by convalescent plasma

360

We collected convalescent plasma samples from a cohort of volunteers who had suffered from

361

SARS-CoV-2 infection evidenced by a positive diagnostic PCR. Samples were collected

362

during the convalescent phase, 4-9 weeks following infection, all samples were taken during

363

the first wave of infection in the UK, prior June 2020 and well before the emergence of the

364

B.1.1.7 variant. We have also collected plasma from volunteers recently infected with B.1.1.7

365

as demonstrated by viral sequencing or S gene drop out from the diagnostic PCR (Dejnirattisai

366

et al., 2021;Supasa et al., 2021).

367
368

Neutralization of P.1 was assessed by FRNT on 34 convalescent samples (Figure 6A Table

369

S3A). P.1 neutralization curves are displayed alongside neutralization curves for Victoria,

370

together with B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. P.1 geometric mean neutralization titres were reduced 3.1-

371

fold compared to Victoria (p< 0.0001). This reduction was similar to B.1.1.7 (2.9-fold) and

372

considerably less than B.1.351 (13.3-fold) (Figure 6C). When using plasma from individuals

373

infected with B.1.1.7 we saw only modest (1.8-fold p=0.0039) reductions in neutralization

374

comparing P.1 with Victoria (Figure 6B and D Table S3B).

375
376

Neutralization of P.1 by vaccine serum

377

We next performed neutralization assays using serum collected from individuals who had

378

received either the BNT162b2 Pfizer-BioNTech or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Oxford-AstraZeneca

379

vaccine Figure 7 (Supasa et al., 2021;Zhou et al., 2021). For the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine

380

serum was collected 4-14 days following the second dose of vaccine administered three weeks

381

after the first dose (n=25). For the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine serum was taken 14 or 28 days

382

following the second dose which was administered 8-14 weeks following the first dose (N=25).

383

Geometric mean neutralization titres against P.1 were reduced 2.6-fold (p<0.0001) relative to

384

the Victoria virus for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine serum Figure 7A,C and 2.9-fold

385

(P<0.0001) for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine Figure 7B,D Table S4.

386
387

Neutralization titres against P.1 were similar to those against B.1.1.7 and only a minority of

388

samples failed to reach 100% neutralization at 1:20 dilution of serum, considerably better than

389

neutralization of B.1.351, where titres were reduced 7.6-fold and 9-fold for the BNT162b2

390

Pfizer and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 AstraZeneca vaccines respectively.

391
392

Discussion

393
394

Large scale viral sequencing programmes have uncovered a spectrum of mutations containing

395

changes at many locations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome in correspondence with the concept of

396

viral quasispecies (Domingo and Perales, 2019). Mutations in S are of particular concern as S,

397

through the RBD, directs cellular tropism and in addition is the target for the neutralizing

398

antibody response. Mutations in S could therefore enhance viral fitness by increasing affinity

399

to ACE2 or provide escape from the antibody response induced by natural infection or

400

vaccination.

401
402

P.1 contains 12 individual changes spread throughout S with three changes in the RBD. In this

403

paper we demonstrate an increase in affinity of interaction for P.1 RBD with ACE2 to an

15

404

equivalent degree as that observed for B.1.351 with binding somewhat tighter than for B.1.1.7.

405

It seems conceivable that this increase in receptor affinity may drive increased virus

406

transmissibility, allowing the three variants to become dominant strains in the regions where

407

they emerged (Zhou et al., 2021;Supasa et al., 2021).

408
409

The ACE2 interacting surface of RBD is a small 25 amino acid patch at the apex of S and is

410

under extreme selection pressure as it not only mediates interaction with the cellular receptor

411

but is also the site of binding for a major class of neutralizing antibodies that block the

412

interaction of ACE2 with the RBD (Zost et al., 2020;Kreye et al., 2020;Wu et al., 2020;Yuan

413

et al., 2020). (Dejnirattisai et al., 2021). Recently, two elegant unbiased approaches have been

414

used to assess the influence of mutation on the ACE2/RBD binding affinity or the ability of

415

RBD mutations to evade the polyclonal antibody response. Firstly, a yeast display approach

416

was used to generate RBD mutants with enhanced ACE2 binding. Amongst a number of

417

mutations selected were the very same positions found in the recent variants of concern, namely

418

E484K and N501Y, and less frequently changes at residue 417 were also observed (Zahradník

419

et al., 2021). Multiple rounds of selection led to the emergence of mutant RBDs with 600-fold

420

higher affinity to ACE2, in the low picomolar range. In a second approach, polyclonal anti-

421

SARS-CoV-2 serum was used to select mutant RBD from a yeast display library which showed

422

reduced antibody binding (Greaney et al., 2021). This approach led to the identification of a

423

number of potential antibody escape mutants, amongst them E484 which is likely responsible

424

for a proportion of the escape from antibody neutralization we describe for P.1.

425
426

What is driving the emergence of the new strains is difficult to determine, the emergence of

427

B.1.1.7 occurred on the background of relatively low population immunity and may have been

428

primarily driven by increased transmissibility. The emergence of B.1.351 occurred on the

16

429

background of around 30% seropositivity in South Africa and P.1 on the background of an

430

estimated 75% seropositivity in Manaus Brazil (Faria et al., 2021). It seems possible that

431

selection of P.1 and B.1.351 may have been in part driven by immune escape, however until

432

methods are developed to screen at a population level for the frequency of reinfection, it is not

433

possible to determine this, especially as reinfection may lead to more mild or asymptomatic

434

disease.

435
436

Because P.1 and B.1.351 contain very similar changes in the RBD it might be assumed that

437

neutralization of both would be similarly affected. This was indeed the case for neutralization

438

by monoclonal antibodies directed at the RBD, where there was substantial escape from many

439

antibodies in our panel or from antibodies being developed for clinical use. However,

440

neutralization of P.1 was not compromised as severely as neutralization of B.1.351, when using

441

convalescent or vaccine serum induced by earlier SARS-CoV-2 strains(Zhou et al., 2021).

442

Using convalescent serum B.1.351 showed 13-fold reduction in neutralization compared to

443

Victoria whilst P.1 was only reduced 3.1-fold, comparable to the reduction seen with B.1.1.7,

444

which only harbours the single N501Y change in the RBD (Zhou et al., 2021;Supasa et al.,

445

2021). Similarly, neutralization of P.1 by vaccine serum was less impacted than neutralization

446

of B.1.351 meaning that vaccination with Wuhan S will likely provide some protection against

447

P.1. There is now clinical evidence that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Oxford-AstraZeneca and

448

NVX-CoV2373 Novavax vaccines provide protection from B.1.1.7 (Emary et al.,

449

2021;Mahase,

454

protection against moderate and severe disease, whilst in a Phase II trial, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19

455

efficacy against mild to moderate disease caused by B.1.351 was 10.4% (95% CI: –76.8; 43.8),

456

but efficacy against severe disease could not be assessed in this study (Madhi et al., 2021).

457
458

The reason for the differences in neutralization of B.1.351 and P.1 by immune serum are not

459

immediately clear, but presumably reflect the difference in the mutations introduced outside

460

the RBD. In addition to our mAb 159 a number of potent neutralizing mAbs have been reported

461

that map to the NTD (Cerutti et al., 2021), and this domain has multiple mutations in all three

462

major variant strains: B.1.1.7 has two deletions, B.1.351 has a deletion and four substitutions

463

and P.1 has 6 amino acid substitutions, including the creation of two N-linked glycan sequons

464

(Figure 1 A-C). Comparison of neutralization of pseudoviruses expressing only the three RBD

465

mutations (K417N E484K N501Y) of B.1.351 with pseudovirus expressing the full suite of

466

mutations in B.1.351 spike show that the non-RBD changes substantially increase escape from

467

neutralization (Wibmer et al., 2021;Dejnirattisai et al., 2021;Wang et al., 2021). The changes

468

in the NTD of the major variants are far less consistent than those found in the RBD, and there

469

are no strong trends in electrostatic properties (Figure 1A-C). It therefore remains unclear what

470

the drivers are for these changes, although one or more of immune escape, co-receptor binding,

471

and modulation of RBD dynamics affecting presentation of the receptor binding site are

472

plausible. Nonetheless, it seems likely that these changes are largely responsible for the non-

473

RBD component of neutralization variation between strains.

474
475

A number of public antibody responses have been reported for SARS-CoV-2, principal

476

amongst these being VH3-53/VH3-66 and VH1-58 (VH3-30 is also found but the antibodies

477

are not potent neutralizers) (Yuan et al., 2020;Barnes et al., 2020; Dejnirattisai et al., 2021).

478

We have previously shown that mixing heavy and light chains from antibodies within VH1-58

18

479

can increase the neutralization titre by 20-fold from the parent antibodies (chimera of 253HC

480

with 55LC or 165LC) (Dejnirattisai et al., 2021). Here we have shown that chimeras created

481

amongst the VH3-53 antibodies using the 222LC are able to confer broad neutralization to

482

antibodies which have reduced neutralization capacity against the viral variants. Furthermore,

483

the chimera of 150HC with 222LC achieved 13 and 3-fold increases in neutralization titre

484

compared to the parental 150 and 222 mAb respectively. Creation of such antibody chimeras

485

amongst other anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies may similarly lead to the discovery of more

486

antibodies with enhanced activity. This also suggests that highly effective natural responses

487

against all three variants, and common cross-protective responses, will be found.

488
489

The recent emergence of a number of variants of concern has led to efforts to design new

490

vaccines which will be able to protect against the viral variants. Exactly which variants or

491

sequences should be selected is difficult to determine in what is likely to be an evolving

492

situation, as vaccine induced herd immunity increases the selection pressure for immune

493

escape. Based on the results reported here the South African B.1.351 is the variant of greatest

494

concern giving the largest reductions in neutralization titres and evidence of complete failure

495

to neutralize in some cases and we believe developing vaccine constructs to B.1.351 to be the

496

greatest priority.

497
498

In summary, we demonstrate that P.1 can escape neutralization by a number of monoclonal

499

antibodies including some being developed for prophylactic or therapeutic use, while other

500

antibodies with epitopes away from the mutated RBD residues retain broad neutralization.

501

Thus S309/AZD1061/REGN10987/ADG10/ADG20/ADG30 showed little to no reduction

502

(<4-fold) in neutralization activity across the three variants, consistent with their previously

503

described broadly neutralizing activities across clade I sarbecoviruses.

505

In contrast to B.1.351, neutralization of P.1 does not show such a substantial reduction by

506

polyclonal serum induced by natural infection or vaccination and there is no evidence of

507

widespread escape. Despite the reduction in neutralization titres it is hoped that immunization

508

with vaccines designed against parent/ancestral strains will provide protection from P.1.

509
510

Limitations of the study

511
512

The in vitro FRNT assays we report here do not measure the effect of complement or antibody

513

dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity which may enhance neutralization in vivo. The role that

514

T cells play in immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and in particular protection from severe disease is

515

unknown and worthy of investigation, but recent findings suggest that CD4 and CD8 T cell

516

responses raised to ancestral strains are minimally impacted by the variants (Alison Tarke et

517

al., 2021;Skelly et al., 2021). It will be interesting to determine the directionality of

518

neutralization between the different variant viruses and naturally acquired antibody responses

519

to them. For instance, there is some suggestion in this report that plasma induced by B.1.1.7 is

520

better able to neutralize B.1.351 and P.1. Measuring neutralization of viral variants by B.1.351

521

and P.1 serum will give a better idea of cross protection against the other strains.

SARS-CoV-2/human/AUS/VIC01/2020 (Caly et al., 2020), SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7 and SARS-

683

CoV-2/B.1.351 were provided by Public Health England, P.1 from a throat swab from Brazil

684

were grown in Vero (ATCC CCL-81) cells. Cells were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus

685

using an MOI of 0.0001. Virus containing supernatant was harvested at 80% CPE and spun at

686

3000 rpm at 4 °C before storage at -80 °C. Viral titres were determined by a focus-forming

687

assay on Vero cells. Victoria passage 5, B.1.1.7 passage 2 and B.1.351 passage 4 stocks were

688

sequenced to verify that they contained the expected spike protein sequence and no changes to

689

the furin cleavage sites. The P.1 virus used in these studies contained the following mutations:

690

L18F, T20N, P26S, D138Y, R190S, K417T, E464K, N501Y, D614G, H655Y, T1027I,

691

V1176F. Passage 1 P.1 virus was sequence confirmed and contained no changes to the furin

692

cleavage site.

693

Bacterial Strains and Cell Culture

694

Vero (ATCC CCL-81) cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle medium

695

(DMEM) high glucose (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2

696

mM GlutaMAX (Gibco, 35050061) and 100 U/ml of penicillin–streptomycin. Human mAbs

697

were expressed in HEK293T cells cultured in UltraDOMA PF Protein-free Medium (Cat# 12-

698

727F, LONZA) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. E.coli DH5α bacteria were used for transformation of

699

plasmids encoding wt and mutated RBD proteins. A single colony was picked and cultured in

700

LB broth with 50 µg mL-1 Kanamycin at 37 °C at 200 rpm in a shaker overnight. HEK293T

701

Participants

708

Participants were recruited through three studies: Sepsis Immunomics [Oxford REC C,

709

reference:19/SC/0296]), ISARIC/WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol for Severe

710

Emerging Infections [Oxford REC C, reference 13/SC/0149] and the Gastro-intestinal illness

711

in Oxford: COVID sub study [Sheffield REC, reference: 16/YH/0247]. Diagnosis was

712

confirmed through reporting of symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and a test positive for

713

SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from an upper

714

respiratory tract (nose/throat) swab tested in accredited laboratories. A blood sample was taken

715

following consent at least 14 days after symptom onset. Clinical information including severity

716

of disease (mild, severe or critical infection according to recommendations from the World

717

Health Organisation) and times between symptom onset and sampling and age of participant

718

was captured for all individuals at the time of sampling.

Data from vaccinated volunteers who received two vaccinations are included in this paper.

755

Vaccine doses were either 5 × 1010 viral particles (standard dose; SD/SD cohort n=21) or half

756

dose as their first dose (low dose) and a standard dose as their second dose (LD/SD cohort

757

n=4). The interval between first and second dose was in the range of 8-14 weeks. Blood

758

samples were collected and serum separated on the day of vaccination and on pre-specified

759

days after vaccination e.g. 14 and 28 days after boost.

METHOD DETAILS

763

Focus Reduction Neutralization Assay (FRNT)

764

The neutralization potential of Ab was measured using a Focus Reduction Neutralization Test

765

(FRNT), where the reduction in the number of the infected foci is compared to a negative

766

control well without antibody. Briefly, serially diluted Ab or plasma was mixed with SARS-

767

CoV-2 strain Victoria or P.1 and incubated for 1 hr at 37 °C. The mixtures were then transferred

768

to 96-well, cell culture-treated, flat-bottom microplates containing confluent Vero cell

769

monolayers in duplicate and incubated for a further 2 hrs followed by the addition of 1.5%

770

semi-solid carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) overlay medium to each well to limit virus

771

diffusion. A focus forming assay was then performed by staining Vero cells with human anti-

772

NP mAb (mAb206) followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (A0170; Sigma).

773

Finally, the foci (infected cells) approximately 100 per well in the absence of antibodies, were

774

visualized by adding TrueBlue Peroxidase Substrate. Virus-infected cell foci were counted on

775

the classic AID EliSpot reader using AID ELISpot software. The percentage of focus

776

reduction was calculated and IC50 was determined using the probit program from the SPSS

777

package.

Cloning of ACE2 and RBD proteins

780

The constructs of EY6A Fab, 222 Fab, ACE2, WT RBD, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 mutant RBD are

781

the same as previously described (Dejnirattisai et al. 2021, Zhou et al., 2021, Supasa et al.,

782

2021). To clone RBD K417T and RBD K417N, primers of RBD K417T (forward primer 5’-

783

GGGCAGACCGGCACGATCGCCGACTAC-3’

784

GTAGTCGGCGATCGTGCCGGTCTGCCC) and primers of RBD K417N (forward primer

785

5’-CAGGGCAGACCGGCAATATCGCCGACTACAATTAC-3’ and reverse primer 5’-

786

GTAATTGTAGTCGGCGATATTGCCGGTCTGCCCTG-3’) were used separately, together

787

with two primers of pNEO vector (Forward primer 5’- CAGCTCCTGGGCAACGTGCT-3’

788

and reverse primer 5’- CGTAAAAGGAGCAACATAG-3’) to do PCR, with the plasmid of

789

WT RBD as the template. To clone P.1 RBD, the construct of B.1.351 RBD was used as the

790

template and the primers of RBD K417T and of pNEO vector mentioned above were used to

791

do PCR. Amplified DNA fragments were digested with restriction enzymes AgeI and KpnI

792

and then ligated with digested pNEO vector. All constructs were verified by sequencing.

Protein production

795

Protein production was as described in Zhou et al. (Zhou et al., 2020). Briefly, plasmids

796

encoding proteins were transiently expressed in HEK293T (ATCC CRL-11268) cells. The

797

conditioned medium was dialysed and purified with a 5-ml HisTrap nickel column (GE

Quantification and statistical analysis

864

Statistical analyses are reported in the results and figure legends. Neutralization was measured

865

by FRNT. The percentage of focus reduction was calculated and IC50 was determined using

866

the probit program from the SPSS package. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was

867

used for the analysis and two-tailed P values were calculated and geometric mean values. BLI

868

data were analysed using Data Analysis HT 11.1 (Fortebio) with a 1:1 fitting model.
