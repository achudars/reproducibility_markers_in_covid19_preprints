Abstract
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a major emerging zoonotic infectious
disease. Since its first outbreak in 2012, the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with
2,468 confirmed cases, causing 851 deaths. To date, there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines against

MERS-CoV, increasing its potential to cause a public health emergency. A critical step in the life cycle of
MERS-CoV is the fusion with the host cell with its spike (S) protein as main determinant of viral entry.
Proteolytic cleavage of S exposes its fusion peptide (FP), which initiates membrane fusion. Previous
studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) FP have shown that
calcium (Ca2+) plays an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved
glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residues. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP share a high sequence
homology and here, we investigated whether Ca2+ is required for MERS-CoV fusion by substituting E and
D residues in the MERS-CoV FP with neutrally charged alanines. Upon verifying mutant cell surface
expression and proteolytic cleavage, we tested the mutants ability to mediate infection of pseudoparticles (PPs) on host cells without and with Ca2+. Our results demonstrate that intracellular Ca2+
enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for
Ca2+ interaction. Electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+
increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration
showed that MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca2+, as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds two. Our data suggests
that there are significant differences in FP-Ca2+ interactions of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP despite their
high sequence similarity and that the number of Ca2+ ions interacting with the FP has implications on the
fusion dynamics of the virus.
Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoVs) comprise a family of enveloped viruses causing respiratory and/or enteric tract
infections across a variety of hosts. Recently, the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV), first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old man in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
has highlighted the pathogenic potential of CoVs [1]. To date, MERS-CoV has caused 2,468 laboratoryconfirmed human infections worldwide, resulting in 851 deaths (case-fatality: 34.48%) [2]. However,
human MERS-CoV originated in bats from where it transitioned into intermediate hosts such as

dromedary camels[3–5]. It is currently believed that disease outbreaks in humans result from interactions
with dromedary camels. Although transmissions between humans is rare, this route was responsible for
a widespread outbreak of MERS-CoV in 2015 in South Korea [6]. Moreover, it was demonstrated that
MERS-like bat CoV could potentially infect human tissues in the absence of an intermediate host when
the respective tissue expresses a protease that is able to prime the virus for fusion [7]. More recently, the
World Health Organization (WHO) listed MERS-CoV as one of ten diseases that requires urgent
accelerated research and development because of its potential to cause a public health emergency with
few or no efficacious drugs and/or vaccines to counter them [8]. To address these needs, it is important
to have a more nuanced understanding of MERS-CoV infection process to develop therapeutics to target
crucial steps in MERS-CoV infection.
MERS-CoV is an enveloped virus that utilizes a class I fusion protein for viral entry into the host cell [9].
The MERS-CoV spike (S) protein contains a receptor binding subunit (S1) and a membrane fusion subunit
(S2), which facilitates binding to the host cell surface receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and fusion
with the host cell membrane, respectively [10,11]. To mediate fusion with the host cell membrane, S
needs to be cleaved by either host cell surface proteases or endosomal proteases (such as transmembrane
protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), furin, or cathepsins) [12–16]. Cleavage can occur at two different sites: the
S1 and S2 boundary (S1/S2), and adjacent to a fusion peptide (FP) within the S2 domain (S2’) [17,18]. It is
suggested that both cleavage events act in concert to promote membrane fusion and viral infectivity. The
first cleavage event takes place at the S1/S2 site, which then is believed to open up the S2’ site for further
proteolytic processing, resulting in the exposure of the FP. As a consequence, the FP inserts into the host
membrane, mediating membrane fusion [19].
MERS-CoV viral fusion can occur at two different locations in the host cell: at the plasma membrane or at
the endosomal membrane. Host cell surface proteases, such as TMPRSS2, can cleave MERS-CoV S for entry
directly at the plasma membrane [13]. In the absence of cell surface proteases, MERS-CoV is endocytosed,

and endosomal proteases, such as cathepsins, can cleave S for endosomal entry. [19]. However, in
contrast to other viruses such as influenza A, MERS-CoV fusion does not seem to depend on a pH change
in the endosomes, as receptor binding in conjunction with proteolytic activation are sufficient to trigger
fusion [20]. A more thorough description of the fusion pathways are summarized in several excellent
reviews [20–23].
A recent study on the FP of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) suggested that the
FP region begins immediately downstream of the S2’ cleavage site and that it can be separated into two
distinct domains, FP1 and FP2 [24]. The authors showed that both FP1 and FP2 increase membrane
ordering and proposed that FP1 and FP2 together form an extended FP which acts as a bipartite fusion
platform. Intriguingly, both FP subdomains required calcium cations (Ca2+) to exert their function in
membrane entry and fusion. It was proposed that negatively charged aspartic acid (D) and glutamic acid
(E) residues coordinate with the positively charged Ca2+ within the fusion platform to promote greater
membrane ordering. Furthermore, the authors showed that depletion of extracellular as well as
intracellular Ca2+ pools resulted in significantly reduced infectivity of SARS-CoV pseudo-particles,
suggesting that both the plasma membrane and endosomal cell entry pathways are regulated by Ca2+.
Other studies too have revealed an important role for Ca2+ in the fusion dynamics of enveloped viruses.
Rubella virus (RuV), for example, requires Ca2+ for virus entry and infection [25]. Ca2+ is coordinated in
between the two fusion loops of the RuV E1 fusion protein by asparagine (N) and aspartic acid and both
residues were shown to be essential for virus viability. More recently, Ca2+ was reported to enhance the
entry of Ebola virus (EBOV) by directly interacting with the FP of the Ebola virus fusion protein [26]. The
authors were able to identify two negatively charged residues (D522 and E540) in the FP that interact with
Ca2+ and this interaction is critical for viral fusion with the host cell.
Here, we addressed the question whether Ca2+ is required for viral entry and infectivity of MERS-CoV by
creating a set of S protein mutants in which negatively charged residues in the FP were mutated to

alanines (A). We used the different mutants in pseudo-particle infection assays to demonstrate that fusion
of MERS-CoV is promoted but not dependent on Ca2+. Biophysical analysis demonstrated that Ca2+
interactions with the MERS-CoV increases membrane ordering in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Our data
suggests that a single glutamic acid residue in a region complementary to the SARS-CoV FP1 domain is
involved in Ca2+ coordination.
Results
S protein mutants with amino acid substitutions in the FP are expressed and cleaved as WT protein
In order to test if Ca2+ is required and which residues within the MERS-CoV FP are necessary for its
coordination, we generated a set of mutated S proteins in which we substituted negatively charged
aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues in the FP with alanine (A) (Figure 1A). We defined the FP region
based on a sequence comparison with the SARS-CoV FP that was described previously [24] (Figure 1A).
The S mutant plasmids were generated via site-directed mutagenesis and verified by sequencing (data not
shown). We next tested whether the mutated S proteins were expressed by transfecting the plasmid DNA
into HEK 293T cells. Since the MERS-CoV S protein can be cleaved by constitutively expressed proteases
during the maturation process, we added a protease inhibitor, dec-RVKR-CMK, immediately after
transfection to block this cleavage. (Figure 2A). Dec-RVKR-CMK was shown to inhibit a wide variety of
proteases such as furin, cathepsins, trypsin, and TMPRSS2 to block S cleavage [15,27]. As we wanted to
confirm that the mutant S proteins are properly expressed and trafficked to the cell membrane surface,
like the WT S protein, we isolated proteins 18 h post transfection via cell-surface biotinylation. Western
blot analysis of the cell surface proteins showed that all mutant S proteins were expressed to similar levels
as the MERS-CoV WT S protein (Figure 2B). With all mutant S proteins expressed, we next wanted to
investigate whether the mutants exhibit the same cleavage pattern as WT S since proteolytic cleavage is
an important and crucial trigger for viral fusion. We accomplished this by treating transfected cells with
trypsin prior to protein isolation. Western blot analysis revealed that the cleavage pattern of the mutated

S proteins was similar to that of WT S, suggesting that the introduced mutations in the FP did not impair
protease accessibility and cleavage (Figure 2B).
Residue E891 in the FP1 region seems critical for the fusogenic activity of MERS-CoV S
After we established that all mutated versions of the MERS-CoV S protein are expressed and exhibit a
similar cleavage pattern as WT S, we initially screened whether the different mutant proteins are
compromised in their ability to induce cell-cell fusion. Therefore, we co-expressed the S protein together
with MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 in Vero cells for 18 h and visualized syncytia formation using an
immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Trypsin treatment of transfected cells was not required as the cells
natively express proteases that cleave WT and mutated S proteins for cell-cell fusion. As a control, we
added the protease inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK to cells expressing WT S to prevent S cleavage and block
MERS-CoV entry [27]. We analyzed the cells by fluorescence microscopy and quantified cell-cell fusion by
counting the number of nuclei per syncytium. Cells expressing WT S exhibited strong syncytia formation
with multiple nuclei and addition of dec-RVKR-CMK as a control efficiently prevented cell-cell fusion
(Figure 3A and B). Strikingly, in the absence of the inhibitor, the E891A and E891A/D892A mutants were
impaired in their ability to trigger cell-cell fusion to the same extent as cells treated with dec-RVKR-CMK
(Figure 3A and B). However, since the cells expressing D892A formed syncytia similar to that of cells
expressing WT S, this suggests that E891 is a critical residue for the fusogenic activity of MERS-CoV S and
was responsible for the E891A/D892A mutant’s inability to mediate cell-cell fusion. All other tested
mutants showed attenuated cell-cell fusion at various degrees, however, none of the mutants was found
to be as defective as the E891A S protein in mediating cell-cell fusion (Figure 3A and B).
Mutation of E891 diminishes infectivity of MERS-CoV pseudo particles
The cell-cell fusion results strongly suggest that E891 is an important residue for the fusogenic activity of
MERS-CoV S. With the exception of D892, the data obtained for the other mutants indicate that they may
play a minor role to trigger fusion. However, the mechanisms of cell-cell fusion and virus-cell fusion may

significantly differ. Factors such as membrane curvature and/or density of viral S proteins may impact
virus-cell fusion differently than cell-cell fusion [19]. Hence, the cell-cell fusion results provide an
indication about the role of the individual D and E residues in the FP region, but need to be verified by
viral infection of host cells. As MERS-CoV is a Risk Group 3 agent that needs to be handled in a biosafety
level 3 (BSL-3) setting, we employed a viral pseudotyping technique to generate pseudo-particles (PP) that
serve as surrogates of native virions and are suitable for infection in a BSL-2 setting. These pseudoparticles consist of a murine leukemia virus (MLV) core and are decorated with their respective S
glycoprotein so that they recapitulate the entry steps (binding and fusion) of the native virus [28].
Furthermore, the PP carry a genome encoding for luciferase, and upon successful infection of cells, the
luciferase reporter is integrated in the host cell genome and drives luciferase production within the cell,
which can be used to quantify the degree of infectivity. We generated PPs carrying the mutant S proteins
and infected Huh-7 cells, a permissive cell line for MERS-Cov infection with high DPP4 expression [15].
After 72 h, the cells were lysed and briefly incubated with the luciferin substrate, which can be oxidized
with cellular luciferase to produce luminescence. The measured relative luminescence values provide a
quantitative read-out for the infectivity of each mutant S protein mediated infection.
To ensure that the infectivity of PPs carrying different S protein variants can be compared to each other,
we performed a Western blot analysis to detect the amount of S that was incorporated into the PPs (Figure
4). Because the cells were not treated with the protease inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK, the S proteins were
cleaved by endogenously expressed proteases. PPs with WT S and the mutant S proteins E891A, D892A,
E891A/D892D, D896A, D902A, D910A, D911A, D910A/D911A and D922A exhibited comparable levels of
incorporated full-length protein (~ 250 kDa) and protein cleaved at the S1/S2 site (~ 130 kDa). Cleavage
at the S2’ site seemed slightly reduced for the D896A, D902A, D910A, D911A, D910A/D911A and D922A
S protein mutants (~ 115 kDa). As the Western blot data show that the PP incorporate similar amounts of

full length and cleaved S proteins, for all S variants, we continued to analyze the infectivity of PPs carrying
these mutated S proteins.
In agreement with the IFA observations, E891A and E891A/D892A PPs exhibited a five-fold reduction in
the infectivity compared to the WT S PP, while D892A PP was not significantly different from WT S PP
(Figure 5A). In addition, we also observed that infectivity of PPs carrying D911A was significantly lower
than WT S PPs. However, infectivity was restored in the D911A/D912A double mutant (Figure 5A),
suggesting that the D911 residue is not as critical for fusion as the D891 residue. If D911 was crucial for
fusion, we would have expected the double mutant to display impaired infectivity as well. None of the
other tested mutants exhibited significant differences compared to infections with WT S PPs (Figure 5A).
D922A seemed to exhibit enhanced infection compared to the WT, but we did find it to be not statistically
significant (Figure 5B).
Depletion of intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ ions abates viral infectivity
SARS-CoV was previously shown to depend on both extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ pools for successful
infection, and it is believed that this dependency is due to Ca2+ interactions with the SARS-CoV FP [24].
Because of the high sequence similarity between the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP, (Figure 1A) we were
interested in determining if extracellular and/or intracellular Ca2+ also plays a role in MERS-CoV fusion.
Our analysis of the negatively charged residues in the MERS-CoV S FP region thus far suggest that E891 is
a crucial residue for viral fusion, perhaps for coordinating with Ca2+. We are further interested in observing
if the fusion behavior of E891 mutants would differ from that of WT in varying calcium concentration
environments. Thus, we focused only on WT S and S proteins carrying the amino acid substitutions E891A,
D892A, and E891A/D892A. Although the D911A expressed decreased infectivity, we did not proceed for
reasons previously mentioned.
First, we depleted intracellular Ca2+ by incubating the cells with 50 µM of 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethaneN,N,N’,N’,-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (BAPTA-AM) prior to infection with PPs. BAPTA-AM is a Ca2+ chelator

that is only active intracellularly and does not significantly impact cell viability at this concentration
[24,29]. Chelating intracellular Ca2+ resulted in a two-fold drop in infectivity of MERS-CoV WT PPs (Figure
5C). Infectivity was also reduced in the E891A and the D892A mutants. However, we did not detect a
significant reduction of infectivity in the E891A/D892A double mutant when depleting intracellular Ca2+.
We next tested the impact of extracellular Ca2+ on MERS-CoV fusion with the host cell membrane by
incubating the cells with 150 µM of ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid
(EGTA) prior to infection. Infectivity of MERS-CoV WT PPs was reduced by 25% when extracellular Ca2+
was depleted (Figure 5D). There was no difference in infectivity with any of the PP carrying the mutated
S proteins.
E891A/D902A Mutation impairs S protein incorporation into PPs and subsequent infectivity.
The results described above suggest that Ca2+ promotes entry of MERS-CoV into the host cell, with a
greater dependency on intracellular Ca2+ concentration than extracellular Ca2+ concentration. Since we
hypothesized that E891 is a critical residue in Ca2+ coordination, we would have expected its knockout
variant, E891A, to have infectivity levels that are independent of Ca2+ concentrations. However, the
intracellular Ca2+ studies show that single mutant E891A is impacted by Ca2+. A possible explanation for
this apparent contradiction could be due to the FP flexibility. Perhaps if E891 is not available for Ca2+
binding, the adjacent D892 can compensate for E891 and maintain Ca2+ coordination in the FP. In support
of this explanation is that the infectivity of the E891A/D892A double mutant is Ca2+ independent, as both
possible residues that can mediate Ca2+ interactions have been knocked out. Thus, we believe that E891
does mediate Ca2+ binding in the MERS-CoV FP1 region. However, previous studies with RuV and EBOV
showed that two distinct opposing residues in the FP region are required to coordinate Ca2+ [25,26], and
so we proceeded to determine the other residues that Ca2+ can coordinate with.
MERS-CoV FP modeling suggests that there are two possible residues in the FP1 region that Ca2+ can
coordinate together with E891, namely D896 and D902 (Figure 1B). Therefore, we created MERS-CoV S

proteins carrying E891A/D896A, E891A/D902A, and E891A/D896A/D902A substitutions. We confirmed
that all three mutated proteins are expressed and trafficked to the plasma membrane in 293T cells as
proteins were extracted by cell-surface biotinylation (Figure 2C). The IFA results show that cells expressing
E891A/D896A, E891A/D902A, and E891A/D896A/D902A are impaired in their ability to form syncytia to a
similar extent as the cells expressing WT S treated with dec-RVKR-CMK or the E891A single mutant (Figure
3A and B). However, when we assessed protein incorporation into PPs, we found that WT and
E891A/D896A PPs carried similar amounts of protein, but the protein incorporation in E891A/D902A and
the E891A/D896A/D902A PPs was significantly reduced (Figure 4). When cells were infected with PPs
equipped with the S mutations, we found that infectivity of E891A/D896A was similar to the E891A single
mutant (Figure 6A). Infectivity of E891A/D902A, however, was significantly lower compared to E891A and
E891A/D896A. PPs carrying the E891A/D896A/D902A S protein were not infectious. These findings are
consistent with the results of the PP Western blot analysis since they incorporate significantly less S
protein, which most likely results in reduced entry. Depleting intracellular Ca2+ levels using BAPTA-AM did
not change infectivity of the tested PPs carrying S with the different amino acid substitutions (Figure 6B).
When chelating extracellular Ca2+ using EGTA, infectivity was also not altered in the mutants (Figure 6C).
In summary, our further mutant analysis to identify the second binding partner of Ca2+ are inconclusive.
The data suggest that E896A is likely not the second binding partner because the E891A/D896A infectivity
is similar to that of the E891A single mutant. However, due to poor incorporation of the E891A/D902A
mutants into the PP, we are not able to compare their infectivity with the WT or E891A single mutants as
those have higher amounts of S protein.
Ca2+ increases MERS-CoV FP membrane insertion and lipid ordering.
We used electron spin resonance (ESR) to examine the effect of MERS-CoV FP on membranes and to test
whether membrane fusion of the peptide requires Ca2+. In this technique, spin labels are incorporated
into lipids at various positions, acting as depth probes. Multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) containing

dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-tempo-choline (DPPTC) are spin labeled in the head region whereas those with
phosphocholine are labeled in either the upper tail region (5PC) or lower tail region (14PC). The ordering
parameter, S0, is an indication of the amount of membrane ordering at a given depth and serves as a
readout for FP membrane penetration depth [30–32]. Changes in membrane ordering may reduce the
energy barrier between two membranes and thus promote fusion [31,33]. Previously studied FPs from
different viruses induced membrane ordering illustrated as an S-shaped curve of S0 as a function of
increasing FP to lipid (P/L) ratio while non-functional FPs and random peptides do not have a membraneordering effect and produce a scrambled signal [24,30–32,34]. Therefore, examining the membrane
ordering effect of a peptide allows to determine whether it is a FP [24,34].
As shown in Figure 7A and B, MERS-CoV FP induced the greatest ordering effect of the head (DPPTC) and
upper-tail (5PC) regions with 1 mM Ca2+. When we tested the deep hydrophobic region (14PC), no
membrane ordering was observed (data not shown). When no Ca2+ is supplemented and trace Ca2+ is
chelated with 1 mM EGTA at the same time, no such ordering effect is measured. This indicates that the
function of the MERS-CoV FP is Ca2+ dependent. Compared to the SARS-CoV FP, however, the MERS-CoV
FP has a weaker effect. For DPPTC case, the maximal S0 for MERS-CoV FP is smaller (approx. 0.472) than
that for SARS-CoV FP (approx. 0.479) at the highest P/L ratio in our experiment (5%). We fitted the S-shape
curve using a four parameter logistic equation Y=S0,min+(S0,max-S0,min)/(1+(X-X0)p), which is a built-in function
of Origin (OriginLab), where the X0 is the P/L ratio (X) that induces half of maximal membrane order
change (S0,max-S0,min), and p is the Hill’s slope. The Hill’s slope is an indicator for cooperativity in a ligandreceptor binding reaction. The X0 for SARS-CoV FP is 0.25% and for MERS-CoV FP is 0.61%, indicating the
MERS-CoV FP is less effective than the SARS-CoV FP. The Hill’s slope for SARS-CoV FP is 2.39 and for MERSCoV FP is 1.44, indicating SARS-CoV FP induces membrane ordering in a more cooperative fashion then
MERS-CoV FP at 1 mM Ca2+. The scrambled peptide shows no effect on membrane order. Although the

scrambled control peptide is based on the SARS-CoV FP sequence, it is used as a control for MERS-CoV FP,
too, because of the high sequence similarity of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FPs (Figure 1A).
To further test the effect of Ca2+ on S0, we varied the Ca2+ concentration while fixing the P/L ratio at 1%.
The effects of any ordering caused by Ca2+ interacting with the liposomes rather than the fusion peptide
was removed by subtracting S0 of a liposome and Ca2+ only (no peptide) mixture from the measurement
of S0 when all three components (liposomes, peptides, and Ca2+) were present, yielding ΔS0. This method
proved to be a solid approach to single out the effect of FP under the influence of Ca2+ in a complex
membrane-peptide-Ca2+ system [24,26]. As shown in Fig. 7C, ΔS0 increased with increasing Ca2+, indicating
that there is more FP-induced membrane ordering at higher Ca2+ concentrations in the lipid head group
regions. When fitted with the same logistic equation, we calculated the X0,Ca (the concentration of Ca2+ to
enable half of the maximal FP-induced ordering effect) for SARS-CoV is 0.32 mM. Although the X0,Ca for
MERS-CoV has a very large standard error and thus is not reliable, due to the fact that the ΔS0-[Ca2+ ] curve
has not been saturated within our experimental range (0-3 mM). But X0,Ca for MERS-CoV is obviously larger
than that for SARS-CoV. The values for SARS-CoV FP and MERS-CoV FP are 1.56 and 0.70, respectively,
indicating that Ca2+ ions bind to the SARS-CoV FP more cooperatively than to MERS-CoV FP. For the SARSCoV FP case, an explanation for this cooperativity is that the SARS-CoV FP has two Ca2+ binding sites, and
binding a Ca2+ ion in one site will stabilize the secondary structure and help to bind another Ca2+ ion in the
other site. The lack of cooperativity in the case of the MERS-CoV FP suggests that it may have only one
binding site.
The binding stoichiometry of Ca2+ and MERS CoV FP is close to one.
To directly investigate the interaction between Ca2+ and MERS-CoV FP, we used isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC). In this experiment, the synthetic MERS-CoV FP was added into the reaction cell at
neutral buffer conditions (pH 7) and 1 ml CaCl2 (pH 7) was titrated into the cell dropwise. The heat flows
generated by the reaction were recorded and the reaction heat for each injection (ΔH) is calculated by

integrating the heat flow over the time. After the subtraction of dilution heat, which is measured by
titrating 1 ml CaCl2 into the pH 7 buffer, the reaction heat between the Ca2+ and the FP for each injection
vs. the molar ratio of Ca2+ to FP was plotted. As shown in Figure 7D, the reaction heats are positive,
indicating the reaction is endothermic. The reaction heats decrease during the titration, indicating the FPs
have been saturated by the Ca2+ ions toward the end of the titration. The reason for the endothermic
reaction may be due to the Na+ ions interacting with the FPs were replaced by the Ca2+ ions. The
endothermic reactions were also observed when we injected CaCl2 into the SARS CoV FP in a similar
experimental setup [24]. Fitting the data with the one-site model, which assumes all binding site(s) have
the same binding affinity, we calculated the binding constant Kb=1.14±0.23 ×104 M-1, the reaction
enthalpy ΔH= 3.12 ± 0.45 kCal/Mol and the binding stoichiometry (Ca2+ to the FP) n=1.12±0.08. The
stoichiometry of the Ca2+ to the MERS-CoV FP is significantly different from that for the FP1_2 of SARSCoV FP (n=1.7) and similar to FP1 or FP2 of the SARS-CoV FP (n=0.92 and 1.02, respectively) [24]. The
results strongly support the hypothesis that the MERS-CoV FP only binds one Ca2+ ion, while the SARS-CoV
FP binds two, one on FP1 and one on FP2. The weaker Ca2+ binding energies of the MERS-CoV FP is also
consistent with the ESR results, which shows that the MERS-CoV FP induces a maximal membrane
ordering effect in a higher Ca2+ concentration than the SARS-CoV FP.
Discussion
Viral entry into the host cell is one of the most critical steps in the life cycle of a virus. Enveloped viruses
such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV utilize class I fusion proteins that facilitate binding to and fusion with
the host cell membrane. A central factor that allows the viral and host membrane to merge is the FP within
these proteins that is exposed upon proteolytic cleavage. Recently, reports demonstrated a crucial role
for Ca2+ in viral fusion, as it coordinates with negatively charged residues such as D and E within the FP.
Here, we show that Ca2+ promotes viral entry of MERS-CoV into the host cell. Of the investigated residues,
E891 seems to be the major residue for Ca2+ binding because the E891A substitution dramatically

decreased viral infectivity (Figure 5A). We believe, however, due to the flexibility of the FP that the
adjacent D892 residue can compensate for the loss of E891 because we observed attenuated infectivity
in E891A when depleting intracellular Ca2+ levels that was restored in the E891A/D892A mutant (Figure
5C). The shorter side chain of D at the 892 position may not establish a bond with Ca2+ as strong as E and
therefore the restoration of infectivity is only very minimal.
Our attempts to identify the binding partner by generating double mutants of E891 with neighboring
residues D896 and D902 were not successful as we observed poor S protein incorporation into the PPs. It
is intriguing that the Western blots and cell-cell fusion results show that the E891A/D902A S mutants are
properly expressed and trafficked to the cell membrane but are poorly integrated the virion surrogates.
One possible explanation is that these mutations impacts the integrity of the FP domain in a manner that
hinders virion incorporation.
The role of Ca2+ for viral fusion has been explored for other enveloped viruses such as RuV [25], SARS-CoV
[24], EBOV [26], human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) [35] and influenza A [24]. There seem to be
significant differences regarding the role of Ca2+ in mediating viral host cell membrane fusion. Studies
showed that Ca2+ does not bind to the FPs of influenza A or HIV-1 during the fusion event. Our prior
observations of influenza fusion protein, which does not show increased membrane interaction in the
presence of Ca2+ [24], indicate that Ca2+ does not act as a blanket promoter of viral FP insertion into target
membranes. [24]. In the case of HIV this leads to structural changes of the FP, which forms an α-helix in
the absence of Ca2+, but changes conformation to an antiparallel β-sheet structure in the presence of Ca2+
[35]. However, it is important to note, that while Ca2+ enhances fusion for the above-mentioned viruses it
is attenuated in its absence, but not abrogated. In contrast, Ca2+ directly interacts with the FPs of RuV,
SARS-CoV, and EBOV and depletion of Ca2+ results in the incapability of the virus to fuse with the host cell
[24–26]. For both RuV and EBOV, key residues within the FP were identified that coordinate with the Ca2+,
and in concert with low pH, resulted in conformational changes of the FP and subsequent fusion. Here,

we demonstrate that MERS-CoV FP has a similar interaction with Ca2+ as SARS-CoV FP but with distinct
differences.
Our data shows that Ca2+ significantly promotes MERS-CoV fusion and that fusion in the absence of Ca2+
is attenuated, but not completely abrogated. This could be due to the fact that the MERS-CoV FP binds
only one Ca2+ ion (which is discussed in greater detail below). On the opposite, host cell entry of SARS-CoV
which binds two Ca2+ in its FP region is entirely abrogated when depleting intracellular Ca2+ levels [24].
Given the high sequence similarity between the FP regions of the two viruses this finding implicates that
the stoichiometry between FP and Ca2+ has a significant impact on the fusion dynamics of the virus.
However, because MERS-CoV shows a similar fusion behavior as influenza A or HIV-1 in the absence of
Ca2+, it could be argued that fusion of MERS-CoV is regulated by Ca2+ to the membrane. We believe that
we can rule out this possibility because our data obtained with the E891A mutant, the ESR and ITC provide
good evidence that Ca2+ interacts directly with the MERS-CoV FP.
By using ESR, we have demonstrated that the MERS-CoV FP also exerts a membrane ordering effect similar
to that observed for SARS-CoV FP as well as for other viral FPs, which further strengthens our hypothesis
that the membrane ordering effect is a required step for viral entry [24]. The membrane ordering effect
is in turn serves as a useful biophysical indicator for examining the conditions required for the FP activity.
Using this method, we have previously demonstrated that SARS-CoV and EBOV FPs are Ca2+ dependent,
and now show the MERS-CoV FP is Ca2+ dependent too. However, although the S-shaped curve of the
MERS-CoV FP is similar to the SARS-CoV FP, MERS-CoV FP has a smaller membrane order effect than SARSCoV FP and at 1.0 mM Ca2+, the membrane ordering effect is saturated by a higher P/L ratio of MERS-CoV
FP than SARS-CoV FP (Figure 7A and 7B). By keeping the P/L ratio constant at 1%, the MERS-CoV FP is also
saturated at a higher concentration of Ca2+ (increase to half of its maximal at around 1.5 mM, compared
to around 0.5 mM for SARS-CoV FP, Figure 7C). Those results suggest that the MERS-CoV FP has a weaker
interaction with Ca2+ and thus require higher Ca2+ concentration reach its maximal activity. This hypothesis

is further supported by the ITC experiment, which shows that the reaction energies between the Ca2+ and
the MERS-CoV FP are weaker than those of the SARS-CoV FP. The ITC experiments also demonstrate that
the stoichiometry of Ca2+ to the MERS-CoV FP is close to one (1.15). This is different to the SARS-CoV case,
in which SARS-CoV binds two Ca2+ in its FP region, one in each FP1 and FP2 [24]. We interpret this to
indicate that one Ca2+ interacts with the MERS-CoV FP.
Thus, although the sequences of SARS and MERS-CoV FP are similar, they may interact with Ca2+
differently. We believe that this interaction occurs in the MERS-CoV FP1 region as our data identified a
residue in the FP1 region that interacts with Ca2+ suggesting that this domain is important for Ca2+ binding.
None of the tested mutants in the FP2 region provided clear evidence that Ca2+ binding occurs in this
domain, which is different from SARS-CoV FP. It is striking that despite the high sequence similarity
between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP, there are significant differences in their FP Ca2+ interactions. The
ESR results indicate that the ordering effect is sequence specific. It is possible that the small difference in
the sequence of the FP2 region of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is responsible for this difference in Ca2+
interaction.
We show here that while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both functionally interact with Ca2+ ions, there appear
to be significant positional and stoichiometric differences between the two spike proteins. Prior
mutagenesis experiments were carried out on the conserved E and D residues in the SARS-CoV FP1-2
region before the recognition of the bipartite nature of the FP and prior to any consideration of their
potential for Ca2+ interaction [36,37]. For SARS-CoV, the residue equivalent to MERS-CoV E891 (E801)
could not be incorporated into PPs when mutated. Instead, the FP1 SARS-CoV residue D812 showed a
major reduction in fusion activity when mutated. The equivalent MERS-CoV residue (D902) only showed
a much more modest effect when mutated. Notably, SARS-CoV D830 (in what is now defined as FP2) also
showed a major reduction in fusion activity when mutated, in contrast to the equivalent residue in MERSCoV (D922). D922A actually showed increased infectivity when mutated, the reasons for this are currently

unclear. Overall, these prior studies are in broad agreement with the interaction of Ca2+ with only FP1 for
MERS-CoV, compared to both FP1 and FP2 for SARS-CoV.
In the biological scenario, a possible explanation for the differences might be that Ca2+ primes the FP for
different steps in the host cell entry process. For SARS-CoV, extracellular Ca2+ binding through the FP2
domain may prepare the fusion loop for subsequent intracellular Ca2+ in the FP1. For MERS-CoV, the
extracellular Ca2+ binding step may not be required as none of the tested mutants in the FP2 region
showed a striking reduction on infectivity whereas intracellular Ca2+ depletion significantly reduced
infectivity. Future studies will be designed to explore how swapping different residues or entire regions
between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP would impact membrane fusion, entry pathways, and calcium
interactions. It would be interesting to see if MERS-CoV will adopt SARS-CoV fusion behavior and vice
versa. Different cell types, however, could also affect the fusion behavior of both viruses. Previous studies
explored the fusion dynamics of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PP using Vero E6 cells [24,38] while we and
others used Huh-7 cells to study MERS-CoV PP infections which exhibit a higher expression of furin and
DPP4 and seem to promote entry mainly via the endocytic route [16,39]. Addressing the impact of the cell
type on the fusion dynamics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV will complement our studies on the FP domains
of the two viruses.

Western blot analysis of MERS-CoV S WT and mutants
HEK293T cells were grown in 6-well plates and transfected with pCDNA3.1+ encoding the respective S
protein variant using polyethylenimine (PEI) (Fisher). For each well, 2 µg DNA and 6 µL PEI were incubated
with 50 µL Opti-MEM (Gibco) seperately for 5 minutes before combining and incubating for 20 minutes.
After 20 minutes, 2 mL cDMEM was added to the transfection mixture. Cells were washed with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) (Cellgro) once and the DNA/PEI/DMEM mix was added. For cells treated with
protease inhibitor, 75 µM dec-RVKR-CMK was added to cells at the time of transfection. Cells were then
incubated for 18 h. For cells treated with TPCK-trypsin, they were washed with PBS once, and 1 mL PBS
supplemented with 0.8 nM TPCK-trypsin was added to the cells. Cells were then incubated for 10 min at
37°C and 5% CO2. Cell-surface biotinylation, western blotting, and antibody analysis were performed as
previously described [41]. S protein was detected using the MERS-CoV S rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sino

Immunofluorescence assay of MERS-CoV S WT and mutants
Vero cells were grown in microscopy chamber slides (Millipore) and transfected with the respective
pCDNA3.1+/MERS-CoV S construct using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfections were performed
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 18 h post transfection, the immunofluorescence assay was
carried out as previously described with the exception that membranes were not permeabilized with
TritonX-100 (Millet PNAS). The MERS-CoV S protein was detected using the same antibodies as described
for the western blot analysis. For quantification, images of at least five randomly selected fields were
acquire. The nuclei of nine syncytia for each condition were counted manually to calculate the average
nuclei/syncytia. Average and standard deviation were calculated using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad
Prism 7. Data was visualized using GraphPad Prism 7.
Pseudo-particle assays
Production of and infection with pseudo-particles (PPs) was performed as previously described with minor
modifications [28]. In brief, PPs of each individual construct were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells
with 600 µg of the respective plasmid DNA, 600 µg pTG-Luc and 800 µg pCMV-MLVgag-pol using PEI as
described above. 48 h post transfection, the supernatants were harvested, centrifuged at 290 x g for 7
minutes to remove cell debris, filtered through a 0.45 µm syringe filter and stored at -80°C in small
aliquots. For infection assays, Huh-7 cells were seeded in 24-well plates. Cells were washed with 500 µL
PBS and 200 µL PPs were added and incubated for 2 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 with rocking. After 2 h, the cells
were supplemented with 300 µL cDMEM medium and incubated for 72 h at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cells were
then lysed, and luciferase activity was measured using a Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega). Readings were
performed with a Glomax 20/20 system (Promega). For each experiment, three technical replicates were
prepared. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism

(St. Louis, MO). All peptides were synthesized by SynBioSci Co. (Livermore, CA). The Sequence of SARS FP
and its corresponding shuffle peptide are the same as in [24].
Vesicle Preparation
The composition of membranes used in this study is consistent with our previous study [24]. The desired
amount of POPC, POPS, cholesterol and 0.5% (mol:mol) spin-labeled lipids in chloroform were mixed well
and dried by N2 flow. The mixture was evacuated in a vacuum drier overnight to remove any trace of
chloroform. To prepare MLVs, the lipids were resuspended and fully hydrated using 1 mL of pH 7 or pH 5
buffer (5 mM HEPES, 10 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7 or pH 5) at room temperature
(RT) for 2 hours. To prepare SUVs, the lipids were resuspended in pH 7 or pH 5 buffer and sonicated in an
ice bath for 20 minutes or when the suspension became clear. The SUVs solution was then further clarified
by ultracentrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min.
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)
ITC experiments were performed in an N-ITC III calorimeter (TA Instrument, New Castle, DE). A total 97 µL
of 1 mM CaCl2 in pH 7 fusion buffer was injected into 1 ml 0.05 mM FPs in pH 7 fusion buffer at 37°C in a
stepwise manner consisting of 5 µL per injection except that the first injection was 2 μL. The injection time
was 15 sec for each injection and the interval time was 10 min. The data were analyzed with Origin
(OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). The one-site model was used in the fitting to calculate the
thermodynamic parameters. The protein concentration is determined by dry weight and UV spectroscopy.
ESR spectroscopy and nonlinear least-squares fit of ESR spectra
To prepare the samples for lipid ESR study, the desired amounts of FPs (1 mg/mL) were added into the
lipid MLVs dispersion. After 20 min of incubation, the dispersion was spun at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The
concentrations of peptide were measured using UV to ensure complete binding of peptide. The pellet was
transferred to a quartz capillary tube for ESR measurement. ESR spectra were collected on an ELEXSYS

ESR spectrometer (Bruker Instruments, Billerica, MA) at X-band (9.5 GHz) at 25°C using a N2 Temperature
Controller (Bruker Instruments, Billerica, MA).
The ESR spectra from the labeled lipids were analyzed using the NLLS fitting program based on the
stochastic Liouville equation using the MOMD or Microscopic Order Macroscopic Disorder model as in
previous studies [31]. The fitting strategy is described below. We employed the Budil et al. NLLS fitting
program [46] to obtain convergence to optimum parameters. The g-tensor and A-tensor parameters used
in the simulations were determined from rigid limit spectra [24]. The ordering tensor parameters, S0 and
S2, were extracted from the spectra, which are defined as follows: S0=<D2,00>=<1/2(3cos2θ−1)>, and
S2=<D2,02+D2,0-2> =<√(3/2)sin2θcos2φ>, where D2,00, D2,02, and D2,0-2 are the Wigner rotation matrix
elements and θ and φ are the polar and azimuthal angles for the orientation of the rotating axes of the
nitroxide bonded to the lipid relative to the director of the bilayer, i.e. the preferential orientation of lipid
molecules; the angular brackets imply ensemble averaging. S0 and its uncertainty were then calculated in
well-known fashion from its definition and the dimensionless ordering potentials C20 and C22 and their
uncertainties found in the fitting. The typical uncertainties we find for S0 range from 1-5 × 10-3, while the
uncertainties from repeated experiments are 5-8 × 10-3 or less than ±0.01. S0 indicates how strongly the
chain segment to which the nitroxide is attached is aligned along the normal to the lipid bilayer, which is
strongly correlated with hydration/dehydration of the lipid bilayers [31,47].

Figure 3: Immunofluorescence assay of MERS-CoV S WT and mutants. (A) Vero cells were transfected
with plasmid DNA encoding for the respective MERS-CoV S variants and the DPP4 binding receptor and
grown for 18 h. As Vero cells express endogenous proteases, which cleaves MERS-CoV S for fusion, no
further protease treatment was needed to induce syncytia formation. WT + protease inhibitor indicates
the condition in which protease inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK at a concentration of 75 µM was added at the
time of transfection to block fusion. Syncytia was visualized using immunofluorescence microscopy by
staining the MERS-CoV S with a polyclonal anti-S antibody (in green) and the nuclei with 4′,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI, in blue). Images were taken at a magnification of 25x. (B) Quantification of syncytia.
Nuclei of 9 syncytia were counted and the average number of nuclei per syncytia was calculated. Error
bars represent standard deviation (n = 9). Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired student’s
t-test comparing the WT against each of the respective mutant * = p > 0.5, ** = p > 0.05, *** = p > 0.005.
