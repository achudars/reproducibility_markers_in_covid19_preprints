Abstract

25

COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has caused a massive health crisis across the world, and

26

genetic variants such as the D614G gaining enhanced infectivity and competitive fitness have

27

significantly aggravated the global concern. In this regard, the latest SARS-CoV-2 variant,

28

B.1.1.7 lineage, reported from the United Kingdom (UK) is of great significance, in that it

29

contains several mutations that increases its infection and transmission rates as evidenced by the

30

increased number of clinical reports. Specifically, the N501Y mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 S1

31

receptor binding domain (RBD) domain has been shown to possess increased affinity for ACE2,

32

although the basis for this not yet clear. Here, we dissect the mechanism underlying the increased

33

affinity using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the available ACE2-S1-RBD complex

34

structure (6M0J) and show a prolonged and stable interaction of the Y501 residue in the N501Y

35

mutant S1-RBD with interfacial residues, Y41 and K353, in ACE2 as compared to the wild type

36

S1-RBD. Additionally, we find that the N501Y mutant S1-RBD displays altered dynamics that

37

likely aids in its enhanced interaction with ACE2. By elucidating a mechanistic basis for the

38

increased affinity of the N501Y mutation in S1-RBD for ACE2, we believe that the results

39

presented here will aid in developing therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 including

40

designing drugs targeting the ACE2-S1-RBD interaction.

Introduction

44

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense, single

45

stranded, enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the Coronaviridae family and is the causative

46

agent of the COVID-19 pandemic.[1, 2] As of December 2020, more than 80 million cases have

47

been reported worldwide, with more than 1.7 million deaths (https://covid19.who.int/). In

48

general, the coronaviruses express four structural protein: nucleocapsid (N) protein that

49

encapsulate the genomic material, membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins, both of which

50

ensure encapsulation of the viral genome, and the envelope-anchored spike (S) protein that

51

protrudes from the viral surface and facilitates viral attachment and entry into host cells. The

52

latter is made up of two subunits, namely S1 and S2. Viral attachment to host cells occurs

53

through binding of its S1 subunit – also known as the receptor binding domain (RBD) – to the

54

host cell membrane-localized angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which

55

catalyzes the hydrolysis of angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictor, to the heptapeptide angiotensin-(1-

56

7), a vasodilator.[3] It is important to note that the affinity of S1-RBD of SARS-CoV-2 for

57

ACE2 was reported to be 10 times higher than that of SARS-CoV-1, providing a biochemical

58

basis for the increased infection efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SAR-CoV-1. Indeed,

59

the ACE2-S1-RBD interaction has become an attractive target for inhibiting viral entry into the

60

host cell.[4-8] For instance, the human recombinant soluble ACE2 protein has been utilized for

61

reducing SARS-CoV-2 binding to the cellular ACE2 receptor leading to reduced injury to

62

multiple organs, including the lungs, kidneys, and heart.[9] Similarly, monoclonal antibodies

63

such as 18F3 and 7B11 have been developed to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking

64

epitopes on the S1-RBD.[10]

66

On top of the increased affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD to ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-1,

67

new genetic variants with increased infectivity and virulence, likely arising under increased

68

immunological pressure in patients suffering from COVID-19 or convalescent plasma therapy

69

[11, 12], have further complicated our efforts towards thwarting the pandemic. One of the key

70

examples of such variants is the S1-RBD D614G mutant that has outcompeted the Wuhan-Hu-1

71

or the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain.[13-16] A comparative study conducted by Hou et al

72

observed that this variant is superior in infecting the epithelial cells and replicates in higher

73

number than the ancestral virus. The structural analysis showed that the S1-RBD containing the

74

D614G mutation are more flexible and explore the open conformation more than the wild type

75

protein, thus, leading to an increased affinity for ACE2.[14, 17, 18]

76
77

In the recent times, a new phylogenetic group of SARS-CoV-2 (lineage B.1.1.7) has been

78

identified in the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium dataset with greater than 50% of the

79

cases belonging to this new cluster B.1.1.7 lineage that has an estimated about 50 to 70%

80

increased transmissibility, as per epidemiological and virological investigations.[19, 20] Indeed,

81

reports of the presence of this variant has emerged from other countries as well. Sequence

82

analysis indicates the presence of a total of 17 mutations spanning the ORF1ab, spike, Orf8 and

83

the N protein in the genome of this variant.[20] Majority of these mutations (8 out of the total

84

17), however, are present in the spike protein. These include deletions mutations ∆H69V70 and

85

∆Y144 and missense mutations N501Y, A507D, P681H, T716I, S982A and D1118H. Of these,

86

the N501Y missense mutation strikes out as one of the most interesting ones due to its presence

87

at the ACE2-S1-RBD interaction interface [21] raising the possibility of an altered interaction

88

between the two proteins. In fact, deep mutational analysis of S1-RBD, in combination with the

yeast-surface-display platform, has revealed an increased affinity of the N501Y mutant S1-RBD

90

to ACE2 (apparent Kd of 3.9×10-11 M for the wild type vs. 4.9×10-11 M for the N501Y

91

mutant).[22]

92
93

In the current study, we performed multiple all atom, explicit solvent MD simulations to gain an

94

insight into the mechanism underlying the increased affinity of the N501Y mutant S1-RBD for

95

ACE2. Simulations of the wild type and the N501Y mutant S1-RBD in complex with ACE2

96

revealed an overall decreased dynamics in the mutant as compared to the wild type complex.

97

Importantly, these simulations showed a prolonged and stable interaction between the Y501

98

residue with the neighbouring Y41 and K353 residues in ACE2 in the mutant complex as

99

compared to the N501 residue in the wild type complex.

ACE2-S1-RBD structure preparation

103

The three-dimensional structure of the ACE2-S1-RBD complex spanning residues S19 to D614

104

of ACE2 and R319 to G526 of S1-RBD was obtained from the RCSB PDB website as a PDB file

105

(PDB ID: 6M0J).[21] PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0.0,

106

Schrödinger, LLC; pymol.org) was used to visualize the three-dimensional structure and to

107

generate the N501Y mutant structure using the Mutagenesis tool plugin available in PyMOL.

ACE2-S1-RBD molecular dynamics simulations

111

Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the NAMD2-14 software.[23] The

112

simulation system consisting of the molecular complex formed by the ACE2-S1-RBD was

113

prepared using the QwikMD Toolkit [24] available as a part of the Visual Molecular Dynamics

114

(VMD) software [25]. Specifically, the protein complex was simulated in an explicit aqueous

115

solvent containing 0.15 M NaCl concentration and at a temperature of 310 K (with a total of

116

about 450000 atoms). Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the default

117

parameters including a 2-fs time-step, a pressure of 1 bar, and a temperature of 310 K, controlled

118

with a Langevin baro- and thermostat, respectively. The simulations were run for a minimum of

119

50 ns, excluding the minimization, annealing and, equilibration steps (except for the second

120

N501Y mutant ACE2-S1-RBD complex run which was run about 40 ns).

121
122

ACE2-S1-RBD molecular dynamics simulation trajectory analysis

123

Analysis of the trajectories was performed using the available tools in Visual Molecular

124

Dynamics (VMD).[25] Independent root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) calculations for ACE2

125

and S1-RBD proteins was performed using the “RMSD trajectory Tool” in VMD.[25] Root-

126

mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) measurements were performed using the indicated RMSF

127

calculation script (Supporting Script 1). The distances between center of masses of specific pairs

128

of amino acid residues such as Y41 and Y501 over the entire length of the simulation was

129

determined using the indicated inter-residue center of mass distance calculation script

130

(Supporting Script 2).

Results & Discussion

145

In order to understand the mechanism underlying increased affinity of the N501Y mutant over

146

the wild type S1-RBD for ACE2, we initiated MD simulations with the available ACE2-S1-RBD

147

complex structure (PDB ID: 6M0J)[21] (Fig. 1). We focused our attention on the N501 residue

148

in S1-RBD and a closer inspection indicated that the residues Y41 and K353 in ACE2 are both

149

located at the ACE2-S1-RBD interface and are in close proximity of N501 residue in S1-RBD

150

(Fig. 1; outset). In fact, N501 has been shown to participate in hydrogen bonding (at 3.7 Å

151

distance) with Y41 residue of ACE2, indicating its potential role in the ACE2-S1-RBD

152

interaction.[21] For this, we initiated multiple, all-atom MD simulations in explicit solvent with

153

the wilt type and the N501Y mutant ACE2-S1-RBD complex structure and analyzed the

154

trajectories obtained for general structural dynamics and specific interactions. Further, we

155

performed the simulations in duplicates in order to test the consistency of the results and

156

statistical support.

157
158

Overall, these MD simulations revealed a generally decreased dynamics of the N501Y mutant

159

ACE2-S1-RBD complex compared to the wild type complex as seen from the composite image

160

of the complexes obtained from the simulation trajectories (Fig. 2A).[27-33] However, RMSD

161

analysis of the backbone Cα atoms of the proteins, ACE2 and S1-RBD individually taken over

162

the entire course of simulations time did not show any clearly discernable trend for structural

163

evolution of amino acid residues in the complex (Figure 2B,C). This suggests that any alteration

164

in the biochemical interaction between the two proteins likely arises due to changes in the

165

dynamics of specific, individual residues in the proteins. Indeed, RMSF analysis of individual

166

amino acid residues in the proteins showed a number of distinct changes with a general decrease

167

in the ACE2 in the N501Y mutant complex (Figure 2D). Specifically, residues positions at the

168

N-terminal (from 19 until 111), central (183 until 206) and to a smaller extent at the C-terminal

169

(from 542 until 588) of ACE2 showed a reduced RMSF values in the N501Y mutant complex.

170

Importantly, reduced RMSF values were observed for the Y41 and K353 residues in ACE2 in the

171

mutant complex. On the other hand, residues 281 to 283 in ACE2 showed an increased RMSF

172

value in the mutant complex.

173
174

RMSF analysis of S1-RBD showed a reduced structural fluctuation of Y501 in the mutant

175

complex compared to N501 in the wild type complex (Figure 2E), indicating an increased

176

interaction with adjacent, interfacial residues, likely in ACE2. Residue positions from 362 until

177

395 as well as the key 501 position of S1-RBD showed a substantially reduced RMSF values in

178

the mutant complex (Figure 2E). The latter is suggestive of the possibility of an allosteric effect

179

of the increased interaction of Y501 in the mutant ACE2-S1-RBD complex as compared to N501

180

in the wild type complex.[27-33]

181
182

Following these analyses, we determined the residue-residue distances (based on the center of

183

mass of the residues) of key residues at the ACE2-S1-RBD interface as they evolved during the

184

span of the simulations (Figure 3A). First, N501 residue in the wild type complex showed a

185

substantially higher structural fluctuation in comparison to Y501 in the mutant complex. In fact,

186

as the simulation progressed, N501 in the wild type S1-RBD moved away from the ACE2-S1-

187

RBD interface, with ACE2 Y41 residue moving in the other direction in the first simulation

188

(Figure 3A; left panel). This was not the case for N501Y S1-RBD mutant, in which Y501

189

sustained its contact with at the ACE2-S1-RBD interface over the entire simulation time (Figure

190

3A; right panel). Indeed, the inter-residue distance analysis revealed a dramatic increase in the

191

distance between Y41 and K353 in ACE2 and N501 in S1-RBD after about 30 ns in the

192

simulation in the first simulation while a smaller increases at different times were seen in the

193

second run (Figure 2B,C). This is in contrast to the distances measured for the same pair of

194

ACE2 residues with Y501 in the mutant complex (~7 and 4.5 Angst, respectively) (Figure 2B,C).

195

These data indicate the formation of a - stacking interaction between Y41 and Y501 and H-

196

bond interaction between K353 and Y501 in the N501Y mutant complex.

197
198

In order to test if these effects of the N501Y mutation impacts interaction at the opposite end of

199

the ACE2-S1-RBD interface, we monitored the inter-residue distances between the hydrogen

200

bond forming Q24 in ACE2 and N487 in S1-RBD and closely juxtaposed (but not in hydrogen

202

Y41-N501 and K353-N501 pairs, these pairs did not show any substantial fluctuations in their

203

relative positioning (Figure 3D,E), suggesting that the effect of the N501Y mutation is largely

204

local, and does not affect the overall interaction of ACE2 and S1-RBD in the timescales that we

205

have explored here.

Conclusion

209

To conclude, the MD simulations performed here with the ACE2-S1-RBD complex provide an

210

unambiguously mechanistic insight into the increased binding affinity of the N501Y mutant S1-

211

RBD for ACE2. Specifically, our computational work shows that the mutation of N501 residue

212

into a Y results in an increased and stable interaction with the Y41 and K353 residues in ACE2.

213

This perhaps is positively impacted by the altered dynamics of the S1-RBD upon N501Y

214

mutation, although the reason behind it is not entirely clear and will likely require further

215

investigation. Although experiments determining binding of fluorescently labelled ACE2 and

216

S1-RBD displayed on yeast cells and computational results presented here clearly indicate an

217

increased affinity, it remains to be seen if the N501Y mutation alone can increase the overall

218

fitness of the virus. The N501Y and associated mutations in the S1 spike protein has gained

219

tremendous interest of the scientific community given that this lineage of SARS-CoV-2 has been

220

suggested to be behind the dramatic increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in UK. We

221

believe that the results outlined here will be helpful in efforts towards thwarting this new wave of

222

COVID-19 by enabling discovery of potent inhibitors of ACE2-S1-RBD interaction [4-8].
