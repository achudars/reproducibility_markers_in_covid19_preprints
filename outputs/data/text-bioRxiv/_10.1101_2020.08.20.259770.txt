and mRNA on the human ribosome inhibits translation initiation

ABSTRACT
SARS-CoV-2 recently emerged as a human pathogen and is the causative agent of the COVID-19
pandemic. A molecular framework of how the virus manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate
infection remains unclear. Here, we focus on SARS-CoV-2 NSP1, which is proposed to be a virulence
factor that inhibits protein synthesis by directly binding the human ribosome. Using extract-based and
reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that NSP1 inhibits translation initiation on model human and
SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs. NSP1 also specifically binds to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, which is
required for translation inhibition. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays to monitor NSP1–40S
subunit binding in real time, we demonstrate that eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) modulate
the interaction: NSP1 rapidly and stably associates with most ribosomal pre-initiation complexes in the
absence of mRNA, with particular enhancement and inhibition by eIF1 and eIF3j, respectively. Using
model mRNAs and an inter-ribosomal-subunit FRET signal, we elucidate that NSP1 competes with RNA
segments downstream of the start codon to bind the 40S subunit and that the protein is unable to
associate rapidly with 80S ribosomes assembled on an mRNA. Collectively, our findings support a model
where NSP1 associates with the open head conformation of the 40S subunit to inhibit an early step of
translation, by preventing accommodation of mRNA within the entry channel.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. A molecular framework for how SARSCoV-2 manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection is needed. Here, we integrate
biochemical and single-molecule strategies to reveal molecular insight into how NSP1 from SARS-CoV2 inhibits translation initiation. NSP1 directly binds to the small (40S) subunit of the human ribosome,
which is modulated by human initiation factors. Further, NSP1 and mRNA compete with each other to
bind the ribosome. Our findings suggest that the presence of NSP1 on the small ribosomal subunit
prevents proper accommodation of the mRNA. How this competition disrupts the many steps of
translation initiation is an important target for future studies.
INTRODUCTION
Beta-coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of
RNA viruses that include human pathogens1. In
the last two decades, two CoVs have emerged
from animal hosts to cause epidemic diseases of
the human respiratory tract: Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV, in 2002)2,3
and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERSCoV, in 2012)4. A third CoV emerged in late 2019
— SARS-CoV-2 — that is responsible for the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic5. Given the lack of
effective therapies against SARS-CoV-2, there
is an urgent need for a molecular understanding
of how the virus manipulates the machineries
present in human cells.
SARS-CoV-2 and the closely-related SARSCoV have single-stranded, positive-sense RNA
genomes nearly 30 kb in length6,7. Upon entry of
a virion into human cells, the genomic RNA is
released into the cytoplasm where it must hijack
human translation machinery to synthesize viral
proteins8. As the genomic RNA has a 7methylguanosine (m7G) cap on the 5'-terminus,
viral protein synthesis likely proceeds via a
process reminiscent of that which occurs on
typical human messenger RNAs (mRNAs)9.
However, as viral proteins accumulate, human
translation is inhibited and host mRNAs are
destabilized, which facilitates suppression of the
host immune response10–13.

Studies on SARS-CoV have implicated nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1), the first encoded
viral protein, as a virulence factor with a key role
in the shutdown of host translation10,11,14. In
infected cells or upon its ectopic expression,
NSP1 inhibits human translation, which is
dependent on its association with the small (40S)
subunit of the human ribosome12–17. In a
connected but separable activity, NSP1
destabilizes at least a subset of human mRNAs,
likely via recruitment of an unidentified human
endonuclease12,13,15,16,18. NSP1 from SARSCoV-2 is expected to employ similar
mechanisms, given its approximately 85%
sequence identity with the SARS-CoV protein.
Thus, NSP1 has a near singular ability to
dramatically disrupt host gene expression; yet,
the mechanism by which this inhibition occurs is
not clear.
The 40S subunit is the nexus for translation
initiation, recruiting an m7G-capped mRNA
through a multistep, eukaryotic initiation
factor(eIF)-mediated
process.
Prior
to
recruitment of an mRNA, the 40S subunit is
bound by numerous eIFs, including eIF1, eIF1A,
eIF3, eIF5, and the eIF2–Met-tRNAMeti–GTP
ternary complex (TC)19. The eIFs make
extensive contacts with the 40S subunit,
including the ribosomal A and P sites20,21. They
also manipulate the dynamics of the 40S head
region to facilitate mRNA recruitment, which has
structural consequences at both the mRNA entry
(3' side of mRNA) and exit (5' end of mRNA)

channels. Following mRNA recruitment and
scanning of the 5' untranslated region (UTR), a
series of compositional and conformational
changes occur22,23. This ultimately repositions
the 40S subunit head into the closed
conformation and accommodates the anticodonstem-loop of the initiator tRNA at the start
codon20–23. Taken together, the intrinsic
dynamics of translation initiation present many
opportunities and obstacles for NSP1
association with the ribosome, and its
subsequent inhibition of translation.
Here, we merge biochemical and singlemolecule approaches to probe the molecular
function of SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 and its
interaction with the human ribosome. We
illustrated that NSP1 inhibited translation
initiation on human and SARS-CoV-2 model
mRNAs, and then determined how the NSP1–
40S subunit interaction was modulated by eIFs
and mRNA. Our results reveal allosteric control
of NSP1 association by eIF1 and likely eIF3j, and
competition between NSP1 and mRNA to bind
the ribosome. Combined with recent structural
studies, our study suggests a mechanism for
how NSP1 inhibits translation initiation.
RESULTS
NSP1 inhibited translation initiation of host
and SARS-CoV-2 model mRNAs
The sequence conservation (≈85% identity)
of SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 with the homologous
protein from SARS-CoV suggested that it would
inhibit human translation (Sup. Fig. 1A). To test
this hypothesis, we employed a cell-free in vitro
translation (IVT) assay using HeLa cellular
extract. As a model of a host mRNA, the 5' and
3' UTRs from human GAPDH mRNA were fused
to a nanoLuciferase (nLuc) open-reading frame
(ORF) (Fig. 1A). This GAPDH reporter mRNA
was added to IVT reactions that contained
increasing concentrations of purified SARS-

CoV-2 NSP1 (Sup. Fig. 1B). Following
incubation for 45 minutes, we observed a
concentration-dependent reduction in nLuc
activity by wild-type NSP1 (Fig. 1B), with an IC50
of 510 ± 20 nM (95% C.I.; R2 =0. 83). Given its
multi-functional potential, we also tested two
mutant NSP1 proteins with alanine substitutions
that replaced both the conserved RK124-125
residues (RK/AA) implicated in mRNA
destabilization or the conserved KH164-165
residues (KH/AA) implicated in ribosome binding
(Sup. Fig. 1). As predicted based on the SARSCoV protein16, the NSP1(RK/AA) mutant
inhibited translation similar to the wild-type
protein (IC50 ≈ 420 ± 11 nM, 95% C.I., R2 = 0.89),
while the NSP1(KH/AA) mutant failed to inhibit
translation (Fig. 1B). The inhibitory effect of
NSP1 on protein synthesis therefore may be
meditated by an NSP1-ribosome interaction,
independent of mRNA degradation.
In the context of infection, full-length SARSCoV-2 genomic RNA and its sub-genomic
mRNAs must be translated in the presence of
NSP1 protein. To examine whether RNA
elements within the viral UTRs facilitate evasion
of NSP1-mediated inhibition, we constructed
model SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs in which the nLuc
ORF was flanked on the 5' end by either the fulllength viral 5'UTR or the sub-genomic 5' leader
sequence (LDR) (Fig. 1C). At the 3' end, we
fused two different versions of the 3'UTR,
beginning after the stop codon for N protein (L)
or ORF10 (S), to account for ambiguity in ORF10
coding potential24. Translation of all four model
viral mRNAs was reduced significantly by
approximately 50% upon addition of 400 nM
NSP1 relative to reactions that lacked NSP1 (p ≤
0.0008, unpaired t-test) (Fig. 1D). The degree to
which NSP1 inhibited translation of the viral
reporters was similar to the inhibition observed
for GAPDH reporter mRNA (p ≥ 0.2, one-way
ANOVA). However, translation of the 5'UTR3'UTR(S) model viral mRNA was 36% higher

than that of the host and other viral reporters (p
≤ 0.0006, one-way ANOVA) in our IVT system
(Fig. 1D). This may suggest that enhanced
translational activity of viral RNAs relative to host
mRNAs may play a role in SARS-CoV-2
infection.
To determine the phase of protein synthesis
inhibited by NSP1, we employed a real-time
translation assay in which nLuc activity was
continuously monitored in situ. From the
resulting time course data, we extracted the
protein synthesis rate, mean synthesis time, and
translational productivity25 from samples where
NSP1 (400 nM) was either omitted from the IVT

reaction, added simultaneously with mRNA
(GAPDH), added after the reaction was preincubated with mRNA, or pre-incubated in the
extract prior to mRNA addition (Fig. 1E). Preincubation of the extract with mRNA allows
translation to initiate in the absence of NSP1,
while pre-incubation with NSP1 primes the
extract for inhibition. If NSP1 disrupts translation
initiation, the inhibition would be dependent on
the temporal availability of NSP1; otherwise, if
NSP1 inhibits translation elongation or
termination, the inhibition would be insensitive to
the timing of NSP1 addition.

The impact of NSP1 on translation was
dependent on its time of addition to the IVT
reaction. Consistent with the end-point assays,
we observed an approximate 2-fold reduction in
the protein synthesis rate when NSP1 and
GAPDH
reporter
mRNA
were
added
simultaneously (p < 0.02, one-way ANOVA) (Fig
1F,G). While protein synthesis rates for the other
samples were similar to the reaction that lacked
NSP1, we observed a dramatic delay in the
appearance of nLuc signal when cell extracts
were pre-incubated with NSP1, but not vice
versa (Fig 1F). This lag between the addition of
mRNA (t = 0) and the initial appearance of nLuc
signal is the time needed for a full round of
translation (‘synthesis time’; sum of initiation,
elongation, and termination). To compare
synthesis times quantitatively, we fit the second
derivative of the nLuc time course data to a
Gaussian distribution (Fig 1H). In this analysis,
the mean of the distribution represents the mean
synthesis time and its amplitude is a gauge of
translational productivity. As suggested by the
raw data, the mean synthesis time when extracts
were pre-incubated with NSP1 (637 ± 41 s)
increased by 54% (p<0.0001, one-way ANOVA)
compared to the reaction without NSP1 (413 ± 5
s), while mean times of the two other conditions
(411 ± 6 s and 435 ± 8 s) were similar to the
control (Fig. 1I). Pre-incubation with NSP1 also
reduced translational productivity approximately
2-fold (p = 0.04, one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 1J). In
contrast, pre-incubation with mRNA yielded
mean synthesis times and translation
productivity similar to reactions that lacked NSP1
(Fig. 1I,J). Thus, ribosomes pre-loaded with
mRNA evaded NSP1-mediated inhibition, which
strongly suggests that NSP1 is a potent inhibitor
of translation initiation, perhaps linked to mRNA
recruitment or accommodation.
NSP1 stably associated with ribosomal preinitiation complexes

To test whether NSP1 binds directly to the
human 40S ribosomal subunit, we employed
native gel shift assays with purified components.
Using an 11-amino acid ybbR tag, single cyanine
dye fluorophores were conjugated sitespecifically onto purified NSP1 (Supp. Fig.
2A,B)26,27. When incubated with increasing
concentrations of purified 40S subunits, the
amount of fluorescently-labeled NSP1 that comigrated with 40S subunits increased (Supp.
Fig. 2C). In contrast, NSP1 did not co-migrate
with human 60S or yeast 40S subunits (Supp.
Fig. 2D). Whereas NSP1(KH/AA) was unable to
block the NSP1–40S subunit interaction,
inclusion of either wild-type NSP1 or
NSP1(RK/AA) at 150-fold molar excess
prevented co-migration of labeled NSP1 with
human 40S subunits (Supp. Fig. 2E). Thus,
NSP1 specifically binds to the human 40S
ribosomal subunit, dependent on the presence of
an intact KH motif in the C-terminus of the
protein. Together with our extract-based assays,
these data indicate that NSP1 binds the human
40S subunit to inhibit translation initiation.
Throughout translation initiation, there is a
complex choreography between eIFs and the
40S ribosomal subunit. Yet, it was unknown how
the NSP1–40S subunit interaction is affected by
eIFs, either through direct interactions or
induced changes in ribosome conformation. We
therefore initially examined NSP1 binding to the
40S subunit in the presence of either 6 µM eIF1,
eIF1A, or eIF3j. Each of these canonical eIFs
bind with high affinity to the 40S subunit28 and
may alter its conformation20,21. Inclusion of eIF1
increased the intensity of the NSP1–40S subunit
band approximately 2-fold (mean ≈ 2 ± 0.4, 95%
C.I.), while eIF3j eliminated the band (Supp. Fig.
3A-C). Unlike eIF1 and eIF3j, eIF1A had little
impact on the NSP1–40S subunit complex
(Supp. Fig. 3A,D). The NSP1–40S subunit
interaction therefore was modulated inversely by
two eIFs.

Figure 2. NSP1 associated with 40S subunits and most ribosomal pre-initiation complexes. A). Experimental setup. Using a
zero-mode-waveguide (ZMW) system, 40S ribosomal subunits biotinylated on RACK1 were tethered to a neutravidin-coated imaging surface
within thousands of individual ZMWs in the presence of various eIFs (also see, Supp. Figure 4B). Upon start of data acquisition, Cy3-NSP1 (Nterminal ybbR tag) was added and fluorescence intensities were monitored. Association of Cy3-NSP1 with 40S subunits was detected via
emission of Cy3 fluorescence. B). Example single-molecule fluorescence trace that depicts association of Cy3-NSP1 with a tethered eIF1–40S
subunit complex. Prior to tethering, 40S subunits were incubated with 30-fold molar excess eIF1. During imaging, eIF1 was present at 1 µM.
The association time (Dt) was defined as the time elapsed from the addition of Cy3-NSP1 until the burst of Cy3 fluorescence (green), which
signified NSP1 association. The lifetime was defined as the duration of the Cy3 fluorescence signal. C). Plot of the fraction of ZMWs that
contained at least one Cy3-NSP1 binding event ≥ ≈ 5s in duration in the indicated conditions at 20 ºC. Error bars represent 99% confidence
intervals (C.I.). D). Plot of apparent association rates (open circles) of Cy3-NSP1 with tethered eIF1–40S subunit complexes at the indicated
NSP1 concentrations at 20 ºC. The dashed line represents a fit from linear regression analysis (adjusted R2 = 0.99), with a slope of 0.3 ± 0.1
and y-intercept of 0.0013 ± 0.002 (errors represent 95% C.I.). Error bars on the open circles represent 95% C.I. of the derived rates. E). Plot of
median association times of 25 nM Cy3-NSP1 (final concentration) with eIF1–40S subunit complexes at the indicated temperatures. Error bars
represent 95% C.I. of the median values. F). Plot of the cumulative probability of Cy3-NSP1 association times with the indicated ribosomal preinitiation complexes. In all experiments, Cy3-NSP1 was present at 25 nM (final concentration) and the temperature was 30 ºC. eIFs were preincubated with 40S subunits, and they were included at molar excess relative to 40S subunits during tethering and imaging to promote formation
of the indicated complexes. eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF5 were at 1 µM; eIF2-GMPPNP-Met-tRNAMeti (TC) at 100 nM; and eIF3 at 50 nM. Lines represent
fits to double-exponential functions. See Supp. Table 2 for samples sizes and parameters for fits. G). Plot of median association times (light
blue) and lifetimes (light gray) of Cy3-NSP1 with the indicated ribosomal pre-initiation complexes. Error bars represent 95% C.I. of the median.

To define the kinetics of NSP1 binding to 40S
subunits, we established a single-molecule
assay to monitor NSP1 association with
ribosomal pre-initiation complexes directly in real
time. First, biotin was attached to purified 40S
subunits that contained the ybbR tag on the
ribosomal protein RACK1 (Supp. Fig. 4A), using
the same strategy as with fluorescent dyes29. We
then tethered preassembled eIF1–biotinylated40S subunit complexes to thousands of zeromode waveguide (ZMW) surfaces coated with
neutravidin (Supp. Fig. 4B)30. Upon start of data
acquisition, Cy3-NSP1 was added to the
ribosomal complex (Fig. 2A), which had
translation-inhibition
and
ribosome-binding
activities similar to the wild-type protein (Supp.

Fig. 4C,D). Association of NSP1 with the 40S
subunit was manifested by a burst of Cy3
fluorescence (Fig. 2B). When NSP1 was added
at 75 nM, the majority of ZMWs (56 ± 7 %) with
tethered eIF1–40S subunit complexes contained
at least one NSP1 binding event (≥ ≈ 5 s in
length) (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the number of
ZMWs with binding events was reduced
dramatically in the absence of the tethered
complex (9 ± 4 %). Similarly, at two different
NSP1 concentrations, pre-incubation with 2.5
µM eIF3j reduced NSP1 binding to baseline
levels (from 48 ± 7 % and 60 ± 7 %, to 6 ± 3 and
7 ± 3 %). Results consistent with specific binding
also were obtained using total internal reflection
fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) at equilibrium

(Supp. Fig. 4E,F). Thus, our assay directly
monitored real-time association of NSP1 with
tethered 40S ribosomal complexes and
demonstrated competition by eIF3j for NSP1–
40S complex formation.
NSP1 bound the eIF1–40S subunit complex
with high affinity. As predicted for a bimolecular
interaction, NSP1 association times (the time
elapsed from its addition until appearance of Cy3
signal) decreased with increasing concentration
of NSP1 at 20 °C (Fig. 2D and Supp. Fig. 4G).
Linear-regression analysis of the observed rates
at various NSP1 concentrations yielded a
bimolecular association rate of 0.3 ± 0.1 µM-1 s-1
(95% C.I.) (Fig. 2D and Supp. Table 2). The
observed lifetime of the NSP1–40S subunit
interaction (the duration of the Cy3 signal) was
dependent on the power of the excitation laser
(Supp. Fig. 4H,I), which indicated our
measurements
were
limited
by
dye
photostability. Nevertheless, with our longest
measured lifetime as a lower bound (238 ± 6 s,
95% C.I.), we estimated that the equilibrium
dissociation constant (KD) of the NSP1
interaction with eIF1–40S subunit complexes
was ≤ 12.5 nM at 20 °C, similar to that of eIFs28.
NSP1 rapidly and stably associated with
different ribosomal pre-initiation complexes.
When added at 25 nM to eIF1–40S subunit
complexes, median NSP1 association times
(see, Material and Methods) were similar at 20
and 25 °C (67–101 s and 66–97 s, 95% C.I.), but
they decreased nearly two-fold at 30 and 35 °C
(38–54 s and 25–42 s, 95% C.I.) (Fig. 2E and
Supp. Fig. 4J). We therefore measured NSP1
association times and lifetimes with 40S subunits
in complex with various canonical eIFs at 30 °C.
Consistent with our gel-based assays, the
median NSP1 association time (at 25 nM) was
decreased about 2-fold in the presence of eIF1
relative to 40S subunits alone (38–54 s versus
91–137 s, 95% C.I.) (Fig. 2F,G and Supp. Fig.

4K). Further inclusion of eIF1A, eIF3 that lacked
the 3j subunit (eIF3), eIF5, and/or an eIF2–MettRNAMeti –GMPPNP ternary complex (TCGMPPNP) also yielded modest reductions in
NSP1 association times. NSP1 lifetimes on the
various eIF–40S subunit complexes were similar
(Fig. 2G and Supp. Fig. 4L) and likely limited by
dye
photostability.
Together
with
the
temperature-dependence, the eIF-mediated
modulation of NSP1 association with the 40S
subunit, particularly by eIF1 and eIF3j,
suggested that NSP1 may associate with a
particular conformation of the 40S ribosomal
subunit.
mRNA within the entry channel of the 40S
subunit inhibited NSP1 association
While this work was in progress, multiple
groups reported structures of NSP1 bound to the
human ribosome31,32. Despite its apparent
flexibility, the N-terminal globular domain of
NSP1 was localized to the solvent-exposed
surface of the 40S subunit, near the entrance to
the mRNA entry channel (Supp. Fig. 5A). This
domain appears anchored by the two most Cterminal a-helices of NSP1, which were dynamic
and unstructured in the free SARS-CoV NSP1
structure solved by NMR33; in the NSP1–40S
subunit complex, these helices were wellresolved, docked within the mRNA entry channel
where they contact ribosomal proteins uS3 and
uS5, and helix 18 of the 18S rRNA. Further
guided by our findings above, we therefore
hypothesized that association of NSP1 with the
40S subunit would be sensitive to the
conformation of the mRNA entry channel and to
the presence of mRNA within it.
To test our hypothesis, we used the internal
ribosome entry site (IRES) from hepatitis C virus
(HCV), a structured RNA that directly binds to
the human 40S subunit with high affinity (2–4

Figure 3. mRNA within the mRNA entry channel of the 40S subunit inhibited NSP1 association. A). Schematic of model
mRNAs. HCV IRES RNAs were biotinylated on the 5'-terminus and contained 0, 6, 12, 24, or 48 nucleotides downstream of the start codon
(AUG). The model mRNA (M+41) contained 41 nucleotides downstream of the start codon, and it was biotinylated or labeled with Cy5 on the
3'-terminus. B). Schematic of the single-molecule fluorescence experimental setup. 40S ribosomal subunits were labeled with Cy5 dye via
RACK1-ybbR. Pre-formed mRNA–40S-Cy5 complexes (± indicated eIFs) were tethered to the ZMW imaging surface. At the start of data
acquisition, Cy3-NSP1 (N-terminal ybbR tag) was added at 25 nM (final concentration) at 30 °C. C). Example single-molecule fluorescence trace
that depicts a tethered 40S-HCV+0 complex and subsequent association of NSP1. The 40S subunit and ybbR-NSP1 were labeled with Cy5
(red) and Cy3 (green) dyes, respectively. Loss of fluorescence signal due to dye photobleaching is indicated. Raw fluorescence intensities were
corrected in this image to set baseline intensities to zero for presentation. The association time (Dt) was defined as time elapsed from the addition
of Cy3-NSP1 until the burst of Cy3 fluorescence (green), which signified NSP1 association. The lifetime was defined as the duration of the Cy3
fluorescence signal. D). Plot of the cumulative probability of observed Cy3-NSP1 association times with the indicated mRNA–40S subunit
complexes at 30 ºC. Cy3-NSP1 was added at 25 nM (final concentration) in all experiments. ‘+eIFs’ indicates eIFs 1, 1A, 3, 5, and TC(GMPPNP)
were included at all stages of the experiment. Lines represent fits to single- or double-exponential functions. See Supp. Table 3 for samples
sizes and parameters for fits. E). Plot of the fraction of the indicated mRNA–40S subunit complexes bound at least once by NSP1 for ≥ ≈ 5s.
Error bars represent 99% C.I.. F). Plot of the apparent association times (light blue) or median lifetimes (light gray) of NSP1 association with the
indicated mRNA–40S subunit complexes. Apparent association times were defined as the reciprocal of the fast association rate derived from
fits to double-exponential or linear functions, with error bars indicating the 95% C.I. of the rate. Error bars for median lifetimes represent 95%
C.I.. See Supp. Table 3 for samples sizes and parameters for fits.

IRES (domain II) swivels the head of the 40S
subunit to open the mRNA entry channel35–37 and
allows accommodation of the mRNA coding
region downstream from the start codon. We
generated five HCV IRES model RNAs that were
5'-biotinylatyed and contained 0, 6, 12, 24, or 48
nucleotides downstream (3') of the start codon
(Fig. 3A). Based on the above structural models,
mRNAs with more than 6 nucleotides after the
start codon are predicted to at least partially
occlude the NSP1 binding site within the mRNA
entry channel. Following incubation of the
biotinylated RNAs with fluorescently-labeled
(Cy5 dye) ribosomal subunits, IRES–40S

subunit complexes were tethered to a ZMW
surface, and Cy3-NSP1 was added at 25 nM
upon start of data acquisition (Fig. 3B,C).
Short and long segments of RNA
downstream of the start codon had opposite
effects on NSP1 association. With HCV+0 and
HCV+6, NSP1 efficiently (80 ± 3% and 81 ± 3%,
95% C.I.) and rapidly associated (apparent kon-1
≈ 11 ± 0.6 s and 8 ± 0.7 s, 95% C.I.) with
tethered IRES-40S subunit complexes when
added at 25 nM (Fig. 3D-F and Supp. Table 3).
NSP1 association to this complex was
approximately 2.5-fold faster than to the eIF1–

40S subunit complex (apparent kon-1 ≈ 29 ± 0.2
s, 95% C.I.) (Fig. 3F and Supp. Fig. 5C). In
contrast, NSP1 associated less efficiently (52 ±
4% and 31 ± 4%) and much more slowly
(apparent kon-1 ≈ ≥ 520 s) with HCV+24 and
HCV+48 complexes relative to HCV+0 (Fig. 3DF). We reasoned that the relative lack of
inhibition we observed on HCV+12 could be due
to inefficient accommodation of the mRNA into
the entry channel. Indeed, inclusion of eIFs
utilized for initiation by the HCV IRES (eIF1,
eIF1A, eIF5, eIF3, and TC-GMPPNP)
exacerbated the increase in NSP1 association
times on HCV+12 to nearly 8-fold slower
(apparent kon-1 ≈ 77 ± 2 s, 95% C.I.) relative to
HCV+0 (Fig. 3D-F). In parallel to inhibited
association, we also observed at least 3-fold
decreased median NSP1 lifetimes on HCV+24
and HCV+48 complexes (11–16 s and 9–15 s,
95% C.I.) relative to the dye-limited
measurements on HCV+0 and HCV+6 (29–50 s
and 38–58 s) (Fig. 3F and Supp. Fig. 5D). We
therefore used the same strategy as above to
estimate that the lifetime of NSP1 on the 40S–
HCV+0 complex was ≥ ≈230 s (Supp. Fig. 5E).
Consequently, the KD of the NSP1 interaction
with the IRES–40S subunit complex was
increased at least 500-fold (from ≤ ≈4 nM to ≥
≈2–3 µM) by long segments of RNA
downstream of the start codon.
To test whether our findings were
generalizable to other RNAs, we preformed
analogous experiments as above in two formats
using an unstructured model mRNA (M+41) that
contained 41 nucleotides downstream of the
start codon (Fig. 3A). In the first, 3'-biotinylated
M+41 RNA bound to 40S-Cy5 subunits were
tethered to the imaging surface (Supp. Fig.
5F,G). In the second, 40S-biotin subunits bound
to fluorescently-labeled M+41 were tethered
(Supp. Fig. 5H,I). In both scenarios, we
observed inefficient association of NSP1 with the
mRNA–40S subunit complexes (16 ± 3% with
40S-biotin, 95% C.I.) and at least 48-fold
increases in NSP1 association times (apparent
kon-1 ≈ ≥ 500 s for both) relative to HCV+0 or

tethered ribosomal complexes that lacked the
model mRNA (apparent kon-1 ≈ 27 ± 3 s, 95%
C.I.) (Fig. 3D-F, Supp. Fig. 5J,K, and Supp.
Table 3). NSP1 association with mRNA–40S
subunit complexes therefore was inhibited
markedly by RNA segments downstream of the
start codon that at least partially occlude its
binding site in the mRNA entry channel.
Intriguingly, NSP1 also has been visualized
bound to 80S ribosomal complexes31. To
examine whether NSP1 could associate with
80S ribosomes, we used CRISPR-Cas9 and
homology-directed repair to establish a FRET
signal between the 40S and 60S subunits of the
ribosome, analogous to our signal in yeast38. The
ybbR tag was appended to all endogenous
copies of ribosomal proteins uS19 (40S subunit)
or uL18 (60S subunit) (Supp. Fig. 6A-D), which
are within predicted FRET distance (≈50 Å) in
structural models of 80S ribosomes (Fig. 4A).
The tagged ribosomes were functional in cells
(Supp. Fig. 6E), and purified 40S-ybbR and
60S-ybbR subunits were labeled efficiently (50–
80%) with Cy3 (FRET donor) and Cy5 (FRET
acceptor) fluorescent dyes, respectively (Supp.
Fig. 6F). After incubation with the IRES from the
intergenic region of cricket paralysis virus (CrPV
IRES), which assembles ribosomal subunits into
80S ribosomes independent of eIFs39, we
observed a FRET efficiency distribution (mean ≈
0.5 ± 0.01, 95% C.I.) between the labeled 40S
and 60S subunits, consistent with structural
predictions (Fig. 4B,C).
By leveraging the FRET signal and the CrPV
IRES, we examined whether NSP1 associated
with 80S ribosomes assembled on an mRNA
(Fig. 4D). We generated RNAs as above with 1,
6, and 48 nucleotides downstream of the CCU
codon present in the ribosomal A site (Supp.
Fig. 7A). With these models, the RNA is shifted
three nucleotides further into the entry channel
relative to the HCV IRES40. Therefore, CrPV+6
and CrPV+48 will have mRNA that at least
partially occludes the NSP1 binding site, while
CrPV+1 will not. When added at 25 nM to 40S–

Figure 4. NSP1 inefficiently associated with 80S ribosomes assembled on the CrPV IRES. A). Model of the human 80S
ribosome (PDB: 4UG0). The 40S and 60S subunits are in gray and pink, respectively. The ybbR tag was fused to either the N-terminus of uS19
(green, 40S) or the C-terminus of uL18 (red, 60S). Based on available structural models, the ybbR tags were predicted to be within FRET
distance in translation-competent 80S ribosomes. B). Example fluorescent trace and calculated FRET efficiency plot. 40S-ybbR-Cy3 and 60SybbR-Cy5 subunits were incubated with the CrPV IRES to assemble 80S ribosomes on the biotinylated RNA. Following tethering of the complex,
molecules were imaged at equilibrium using TIRFM. Molecules were expected to begin in a Cy3 (green, FRET donor) to Cy5 (red, acceptor)
FRET state, followed by photobleaching of both dyes. The region of the trace that corresponds to FRET is highlighted by the gray box. C). Plot
of the distribution of observed FRET efficiencies for the inter-subunit FRET signal on 80S ribosomes. Frequencies of observed FRET efficiencies
were binned into 35 bins (open circles) across the indicated range. The line represents a fit to a single-gaussian function, which yielded a mean
FRET efficiency of 0.5 ± 0.01 (95% C.I.). n = 104. D). Schematic of the single-molecule fluorescence experimental setup. 40S ribosomal subunits
were labeled with Cy3 dye via uS19-ybbR, and 60S subunits were labeled with Cy5 via uL18-ybbR. Pre-formed 80S–CrPV IRES complexes
were tethered to the ZMW imaging surface. At the start of data acquisition, Cy5.5-NSP1 (N-terminal ybbR tag) was added at 25 nM (final
concentration) at 30 °C. E). Example single-molecule fluorescence traces that depict addition of Cy5.5-NSP1 to tethered CrPV+1 RNAs bound
by 80S ribosomes. The 40S subunit was labeled with Cy3 (green), 60S subunit with Cy5 (red), and NSP1 with Cy5.5 (magenta). The two traces
are from the same experiment where 80S–CrPV+1 complexes were tethered. The top trace depicts a complex with an NSP1 binding event
(~30% of traces) and the bottom trace lacks an NSP1 event (~70% of traces). Raw fluorescence intensities were corrected in this image to set
baseline intensities to zero for presentation. Due to bleed through across the three fluorescent channels, the Cy3, Cy5, and Cy5.5 signals were
made transparent before and after relevant events for presentation here. The association time (Dt) was defined as the time elapsed from the
addition of Cy5.5-NSP1 until the burst of Cy5.5 fluorescence (magenta), which signified NSP1 association. The lifetime was defined as the
duration of the Cy5.5 fluorescence signal. F). Plot of the cumulative probability of observed NSP1 association times with the indicated ribosomal–
CrPV IRES complexes at 30 ºC. Cy5.5-NSP1 was added at 25 nM (final concentration). Lines represent fits to double-exponential functions.
See Supp. Table 4 for samples sizes and parameters for fits.

CrPV+1 complexes, we observed slower
(median association time ≈ 119–189 s, 95% C.I.)
and less efficient (45 ± 4%, 95% C.I.) Cy5.5NSP1 association relative to that of 40S–HCV+0
complexes (median ≈ 46–82 s and 72 ± 4%,
95% C.I.) (Supp. Fig. 7B,C and Supp. Table 4).
This finding likely reflects heterogeneity of the
40S subunit head conformation when bound to
the CrPV IRES41, unlike the near-homogenous
open conformation induced by the HCV IRES.
Further inclusion of 60S subunits to yield 80S–
CrPV+1 complexes inhibited NSP1 association
(median association time ≈ 235–285 s, 95%

C.I.), similar to the inhibition observed on both
80S–CrPV+6 and 80S–CrPV+48 complexes
(median association times ≈ 243–292 s and
288–354 s, 95% C.I.) (Fig. 4E,F and Supp. Fig.
7C). Thus, even when mRNA was absent from
it, the conformation of the mRNA entry channel
on
80S–CrPV
IRES
complexes
was
incompatible with rapid NSP1 association.
Our findings support a model where NSP1
associates with the open conformation of the
40S ribosomal subunit, in the absence of mRNA
within the entry channel. They also suggest that

Figure 5. NSP1 remained bound to 40S subunits upon association with model mRNAs. A). Plot of the fraction of 40S subunit
binding events that had a co-associated NSP1 (left) or at least one NSP1 re-association event (right), as defined below in panel B. Error bars
represent 99% C.I.. B). Example single-molecule fluorescence trace that depicts association of NSP1–40S subunit complexes with a tethered
HCV+0 IRES molecule. The 40S subunit and NSP1 were labeled with Cy3 (green) and Cy5.5 (magenta) dyes, respectively. Raw fluorescence
intensities were corrected in this image to set baseline intensities to zero for presentation. The NSP1–40S subunit association time (Dt1) was
defined as the time elapsed from the addition of the complex until the burst of Cy3 and Cy5.5 fluorescence, which signified association of the
NSP1-40S subunit complex with the tethered IRES. In experiments that lacked NSP1, Dt1 was defined using the first burst of Cy3 signal alone.
The 40S subunit lifetime (𝜏1) was defined as the duration of the Cy3 fluorescence signal. The initial NSP1 lifetime (NSP1 𝜏1) was defined as the
duration of the Cy5.5 signal that co-appeared with the Cy3 signal. For NSP1 re-association analyses, we focused on ZMWs where a single 40S
subunit associated within the first 200 s (≈ 75% of all events, see Supp. Fig. 8D). We then quantified the time elapsed from the loss of the first
Cy5.5 signal to the next burst of Cy5.5 fluorescence at least ≈ 20 s in length (≈ 70% of initial NSP1 binding events, see Supp. Fig. 8F), which
was defined as the NSP1 re-association time (NSP1 Dt2). The duration of this second Cy5.5 event was defined as the re-associated NSP1
lifetime (NSP1 𝜏2). C,D). Plot of association times (panel C) and median lifetimes (panel D) from the indicated experiments. ‘+NSP1’ indicates
experiments where pre-formed NSP1–40S subunit complexes were added. Association times (40S Dt1 and NSP1 Dt2) were defined as the
inverse of the fast association rate derived from fits to double-exponential or linear functions, with error bars indicating the 95% C.I. of the rate.
Error bars for median lifetimes (40S 𝜏1, NSP1 𝜏1 and 𝜏2) represent 95% C.I.. See Supp. Table 5 for samples sizes and parameters for fits.

NSP1 is unable to rapidly bind 80S ribosomes in
either the canonical or rotated states prior to
peptide bond formation and translocation. Future
studies will be needed to examine whether NSP1
accesses other states of the 80S ribosome.
NSP1 remained bound to 40S subunits upon
association with model mRNAs
Our data above indicated that mRNA
inhibited NSP1 association with the 40S
ribosomal subunit. However, it remained unclear
whether RNA segments downstream of a start
codon would destabilize the NSP1–40S subunit
complex upon mRNA recruitment. To focus
solely on NSP1, the 40S subunit, and mRNA, we
again leveraged the HCV IRES. Using Cy5.5NSP1 and 40S-Cy3 subunits, we pre-formed
NSP1–40S complexes and added the complex
at 15 nM to ZMWs with surface-immobilized
HCV+0 or HCV+48 model mRNAs (Supp. Fig.
8A-C). On HCV+0 and HCV+48, NSP1 coassociated with 57 ± 6% and 60 ± 6% (99% C.I.)
of 40S subunits (Fig. 5A,B and Supp. Table 5),
which indicated near saturation of 40S subunits
with NSP1. Association of the NSP1–40S

subunit complex with the tethered RNAs had
kinetics similar to 40S subunits alone (Fig. 5C,D
and Supp. Fig. 8D,E). After association, NSP1
remained bound to the 40S subunit for
approximately 60 s on average (median lifetimes
39–74 s and 52–82 s, 95% C.I.) (Fig. 5D and
Supp. Fig. 8F). Consistent with our findings
using the HCV IRES, NSP1 lifetimes on the
ribosomal subunit were similar for both CrPV+1
and CrPV+48 model RNAs (Supp. Fig. 8G-N).
Thus, the stability of NSP1 on the 40S subunit
was unaffected upon direct association with the
structured mRNAs we examined.
To delineate competition between NSP1 and
mRNA for the 40S cleft, we next asked whether
NSP1 could re-associate stably with single
IRES–40S subunit complexes and how reassociation was impacted by long segments of
RNA downstream of the start codon. Indeed,
following loss of the initial NSP1 signal (due to
dye photobleaching or NSP1 departure), 80 ±
6% (99% C.I.) of 40S–HCV+0 complexes had at
least one additional stable (≥ 20 s) NSP1
binding event (Fig. 5A,B and Supp. Fig. 8B). In
contrast, only 32 ± 7% (99% C.I.) of 40S–

Figure 6. Proposed model. In the absence of eIF3j, NSP1 preferentially associates with the open conformation of the 40S subunit to block
full accommodation of the mRNA in the entry channel, which inhibits translation initiation. How incomplete mRNA accommodation impacts
mRNA recruitment, scanning, start codon selection, 60S subunit recruitment, and the transition to elongation remain open questions. Whether
and how NSP1–40S subunit complexes lead to mRNA degradation is also unknown.

HCV+48 complexes had a second, stable NSP1
event (Fig. 5A,B and Supp. Fig. 8C). When
multiple NSP1 association events were
observed on a single 40S–IRES complex, the
time that separated them was at least 55-fold
longer on HCV+48 (apparent kon-1 ≈ ≥ 700 s)
relative to HCV+0 (apparent kon-1 ≈ 13 ± 1 s,
95% C.I.) (Fig. 5C and Supp. Fig. 8O). The
lifetimes of initial and re-associated NSP1
binding events were similar (Fig. 5D and Supp.
Fig. 8P). Together, these findings indicated that
once NSP1 dissociated from the 40S–HCV+48
complex, mRNA was accommodated more
rapidly into the mRNA entry channel, thereby
inhibiting re-association of NSP1.
DISCUSSION
Shutdown of host protein synthesis is a
common feature of viral infection. Most
characterized mechanisms involve the covalent
inactivation of key eIFs or their regulators (e.g.,
eIF2 and eIF4F42). Here, we provide insight into
a distinct form of translation inhibition employed
by SARS-CoV-2 and closely-related CoVs. The
first protein encoded in the viral genomic RNA,
NSP1, directly targets the small subunit of the
human ribosome to inhibit protein synthesis.
Based on our findings and recent structural
studies31,32, we suggest that NSP1 preferentially
associates with the open conformation of the
40S subunit to prevent proper accommodation of
mRNA during translation initiation (Fig. 6).

NSP1 is a potent inhibitor of human
translation initiation. When we added purified
NSP1 to human HeLa cell extract, we observed
a dramatic reduction in translation of our model
for human GAPDH mRNA. Inhibition was
specific, as mutations in two NSP1 amino acids
(KH164-165) necessary for 40S subunit binding
abrogated the NSP1 inhibition. The apparent
IC50 value for wild-type NSP1-mediated inhibition
suggests near stochiometric association of
NSP1 with 40S subunits in the cell extract, which
agrees well with our best estimate for the KD of
the interaction (≤ 4 nM). Based on our kinetic
analysis of protein synthesis, we demonstrate
that such NSP1 association with the 40S subunit
inhibits the initiation phase of translation.
Consistently, a recent study31 illustrated that
ectopic expression of SARS-CoV-2 NSP1
reduced the abundance of actively-translating
polysomes and increased the abundance of 80S
monosomes, a hallmark of translation initiation
defects. Similar findings also have been
observed with the SARS-CoV protein16,17.
NSP1 inhibited translation of SARS-CoV-2
model mRNAs at levels comparable to that for a
model human mRNA. This finding suggests that
NSP1 is a general inhibitor of protein synthesis.
The high affinity of NSP1 for the 40S subunit
likely demands buildup of NSP1 protein levels
before translation is inhibited broadly, which may
enable viral protein synthesis to proceed
unimpeded during early stages of infection.
Once NSP1 has accumulated, the increased

translation efficiency of the viral mRNAs relative
to human mRNAs we and others32 have
observed may enable the virus to synthesize
sufficient amounts of viral proteins, even when
translation is largely shutdown. However, it is
possible that another viral protein, a different
segment of the viral genome, or another
mechanism (e.g., sequestration) allows the virus
to evade translation inhibition. Future studies in
the context of infected human cells are needed
to deconvolute these possibilities.
To inhibit translation initiation, multiple lines
of evidence suggest that NSP1 preferentially
associates with the open conformation of the
40S subunit. First, of all eIFs we examined,
NSP1 association was enhanced the most (≈ 2fold) by eIF1. This protein binds to the 40S
subunit at the ribosomal P site43–45, where it has
a critical role during start codon recognition46–50.
Upon its association, eIF1 repositions the 40S
subunit head, which concomitantly opens the
mRNA entry channel51,52. Given that eIF1 and
NSP1 binding sites are non-overlapping, our
findings indicate that eIF1 allosterically
enhances NSP1 association, likely by altering
the conformation of the mRNA entry channel to
allow NSP1 access. Second, the most rapid
NSP1 association with the 40S subunit we
observed was in the presence of the HCV IRES.
This structured RNA directly manipulates the
ribosomal subunit to bypass eIFs and initiate
translation53. One of its flexible segments,
domain II, makes extensive contacts with the
40S subunit head, which swivels, opening the
mRNA entry channel35–37. In our assays, the
estimated rate of NSP1 association with the
HCV+0 model mRNA was 3–4 µM-1 s-1, nearly an
order of magnitude faster than with 40S subunits
alone. Enhanced NSP1 association with this
complex relative to the eIF1–40S subunit
complex likely reflects inherent differences in
their stability. Whereas the IRES–40S subunit
complex is quite stable (KD ≈ 2 nM, koff ≈ 0.002
s-1)34,54, the eIF1–40S subunit interaction is more
transient (KD ≈ 50 nM, koff ≈ 0.36 s-1)28,50, which
would lead to a mixed population of open and

closed conformations. Consistently, NSP1
associated more slowly with the 40S–CrPV+1
complex, which likely also contains a
heterogenous
mix
of
entry
channel
conformations41.
In striking contrast, NSP1 competes with
mRNA to bind the ribosome. When 40S subunits
were pre-incubated with an mRNA that had at
least 12 nucleotides downstream of the start
codon, we observed marked inhibition of NSP1
association with the ribosomal subunit. On such
mRNAs, NSP1 contacts with helix 18 of the 18S
rRNA and ribosomal proteins uS3 and uS5 in the
mRNA entry channel are at least partially
occluded by the accommodated mRNA.
Consistently, when we pre-incubated mRNA in
extracts prior to NSP1 addition, NSP1 failed to
inhibit translation in our real-time protein
synthesis assays. And in the reciprocal
experiment, pre-incubation with NSP1 yielded a
delay in protein synthesis (≈ 200 s) similar in
length to our best estimate for the lifetime of the
NSP1–40S subunit interaction (at least ≈ 240 s).
In parallel, NSP1 association with the 40S
subunit also was inhibited by pre-incubation with
eIF3j, which binds near the mRNA entry
channel55,56. The C-terminus of eIF3j may
sterically block NSP1 association55 or eIF3j may
limit movement of the 40S subunit head to
promote a conformation of the entry channel
inaccessible to NSP1, which may reflect the
likely preference of eIF3j for the closed
conformation of the 40S subunit57.
In further support of a competition model,
NSP1 remained bound to the 40S ribosomal
subunit upon recruitment of an mRNA—
regardless of its length. This finding suggests
that mRNA itself is insufficient to dislodge or
destabilize the NSP1–40S subunit interaction.
Based on our observed lifetime of that interaction
(at least ≈ 240 s), NSP1 likely will remain
associated with the ribosomal subunit for longer
than the time frame of translation initiation on
many mRNAs (< 60 s)58,59, thereby blocking full
accommodation of the mRNA. Whether NSP1

can be dislodged by other host proteins or eIFs,
such as helicases eIF4A, DDX3X, or DHX29,
remains unclear. Nevertheless, once NSP1
dissociated, mRNA was accommodated into the
entry channel, which prevented re-association of
NSP1. Thus, our findings suggest that the
presence of NSP1 or mRNA within the mRNA
entry channel of the 40S subunit are mutually
exclusive. It is feasible that such competition

blocks eIF4F-mediated recruitment of an m7Gcapped mRNA to the 40S subunit or a
subsequent step in initiation, which awaits
elucidation by future studies. Collectively, our
work provides a biophysical foundation for
deeper understanding of NSP1-mediated
shutdown of host translation and its impact on

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Molecular cloning. See Supplementary Table 6 for all relevant sequences.
NSP1. Codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 and relevant mutants were cloned into a vector purchased from
the UC Berkeley QB3 MacroLab (vector 1B) using their standard protocol. Synthetic DNA that encoded wild-type,
RK124-125AA mutant, KH164-165AA mutant, and ybbR-tagged NSP1 sequences were purchased from
Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). All sequences were verified by Sanger sequencing. The resulting plasmids
encoded NSP1 proteins tagged on the N-terminus with a 6-histidine tag followed by a TEV protease cleavage site
(NH2-6His–TEV–NSP1-COOH). Wild-type NSP1 reference sequence (nts 266-805) was obtained from NCBI
GenBank accession MN997409.1. When noted, a ybbR tag was included either on the N-terminus (ybbR-NSP1)
or the C-terminus (NSP1-ybbR).
HCV IRES. A synthetic DNA was purchased from IDT that contained a 5' flanking sequence (pUC19
backbone sequence), a T7 promoter (TAATACGACTCACTATAG), and the HCV IRES (nts 1-344, including the
AUG codon). Downstream of the AUG included the rest of domain IV, the core sequence, and a 3’ extension:
AGCACGAATCCTAAACCTCAAAGAAAAACCGCCAGAACCATGGAAGAC. DNA templates that encoded
HCV+0, +6, +12, +24, and +48 (relative to the ‘G’ of the start codon, 3'-end indicated by underlined nts) were
generated via standard PCRs using NEB Phusion polymerase (25 cycles), a common 5’ primer (upstream of the
T7 promoter), and specific 3' primers.
CrPV IRES. A plasmid that encodes the IRES of the intergenic region of CrPV with the first codon (Ala)
replaced with a Phe codon (TTC) was described previously60. The sequence from CCU (bolded) of the IRES to
the 3' end was: CCTTTCACATTTCAAGATACCGGCGCCATGGAAGACGCCAAAAACATAAAG. DNA templates
were generated as for the HCV IRES, with the underlined nts representing the 3'-terminus. We selected +1 as the
shortest segment to promote proper folding of the IRES.
GAPDH nanoLuciferase. The reporter was designed to contain a 5' T7 promoter, the nLuc coding sequence
(Promega) flanked by the 5' and 3'UTRs from human GAPDH (NCBI GenBank accession: AF261085), a poly(A)
tail, and PmeI and SpeI restriction enzyme consensus sites. The reporter construct was purchased from IDT as a
plasmid with an pUCIDT backbone and propagated in the DH5a strain of E. coli . DNA sequence identity was
confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The plasmid was linearized by restriction digest with SpeI (NEB, #R0133) for
templated in vitro transcription.
SARS-CoV-2 nanoLuciferase. Viral DNA (NCBI GenBank accession MN997409.1) constructs were designed
such that the nLuc coding sequence was flanked by either the full-length 5'UTR or the subgenomic 5' leader
sequence and one of two 3ʹ'UTR sequences, and a poly A tail followed by a SpeI consensus sequence. The fulllength 5'UTR incuded the first 27 nt of the viral ORF in order to maintain the predicted stem-loop structure within
the 5'UTR. The 3'UTR (L) began after the N protein stop codon and the 3'UTR (S) began after ORF10. Synthetic
DNAs were purchased as GeneBlocks from IDT (5' leader constructs) or as Gene Parts from GenScript (5'UTR
constructs). All synthetic DNAs had a 5'-terminal XmaI consensus sequence and 3'-terminal HindIII consensus

#R3104S, #M2200S).
NSP1 expression, purification, & labeling
NSP1 expression plasmids were transformed into OneShot BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen) and grown overnight
at 37 °C on LB agar plates supplemented with 50 µg/mL kanamycin. Liquid cultures of single colonies were grown
to OD600 ≈ 0.5 at 37 °C in LB supplemented with kanamycin. Cultures were shifted to 18 °C for 30 minutes, 0.5
mM IPTG was added, and cultures were grown for 16-20 h at 18 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at
5,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C in a Fiberlite F9 rotor (ThermoFisher, cat. # 13456093). Cells were lysed by
sonication in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 40 mM imidazole, and 5 mM
β-mercaptoethanol), and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 38,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Fiberlite F21
rotor followed by filtration through a 0.22 µm syringe filter. Clarified lysate was loaded onto a Ni-NTA gravity flow
column equilibrated in lysis buffer, washed with 20 column volumes (CV) of lysis buffer, 20 CV of wash buffer (20
mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 40 mM imidazole, and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol), and 10 CV
of lysis buffer. Recombinant proteins were eluted with five sequential CV of elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,
300 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 300 mM imidazole, and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol). Fractions with recombinant
protein were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis. The relevant fractions were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C into ybbRlabeling buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mM DTT) or
TEV Buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM imidazole, and 5 mM βmercaptoethanol), as appropriate. Fluorescent labeling via the ybbR tag was performed essentially as
described26,29. Briefly, 14.5 µM ybbR-NSP1 or NSP1-ybbR were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min with 4 µM Sfp
synthase enzyme and 20 µM of either Cy3-CoA, Cy5-CoA, or Cy5.5-CoA substrates, respectively. Free dye was
removed via purification over 10DG-desalting columns (Bio-Rad, cat.# 7322010) equilibrated in TEV buffer. Dyelabeled and non-labeled NSP1 proteins were incubated with TEV protease at 22 °C for 1.5 hrs followed by 30 min
at 37 °C. TEV protease, Sfp synthase, and the cleaved 6His tag were removed via a subtractive Ni-NTA gravity
column equilibrated in TEV buffer, with the flow-through collected. NSP1 proteins were subjected to a final
purification step using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex 75 column (23 mL) equilibrated in
SEC buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 250 mM KOAc, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mM DTT). Fractions
containing NSP1 were concentrated using a 10 kD MWCO Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter, aliquoted, flash frozen
on liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined via absorption at 280 nm using a
nanodrop for total protein, and at 548 nM or 646 nM for Cy3 or Cy5/5.5 labeled proteins, respectively. For ybbRNSP1, labeling efficiencies were 50-70%. For NSP1-ybbR, the labeling efficiency was much lower (<20%), and
the protein had reduced translation inhibition activity, which is why it was excluded from single-molecule analyses.
nLuc in vitro translation assays
HeLa cell-free translation (ThermoFisher, #88884) reactions setup according to manufacturer’s protocol were
programed with a final mRNA concentration of 200 nM (endpoint) or 80 nM (real-time). For reactions containing
NSP1, an equal volume of NSP1 buffer was added to the paired no NSP1 control reaction. Prism8 was used for
dose-response analysis ([inhibitor] vs. response with variable slope (four parameters) nonlinear fit) and statistical
analysis (one-way ANVA Turkey’s multiple comparisons test, unpaired t-test).
Endpoint assays. IVT reactions were incubated at 37°C for 45 min and then immediately transferred to an ice
water bath and diluted 1:1 with cold Glo Lysis Buffer (Promega, #E2661). All samples were brought to room
temperature and mixed with a 1:1 volume of nGlow solution (Promega, #N1110). Samples (90% of total volume)
were loaded into non-adjacent wells of a 384-well plate. Sample luminescence was measured 7 min post nGlow
solution addition using a BioTek Neo2 multi-mode plate reader (25°C, 114LUM1537 filter, gain of 135).
Luminescence signal was monitored for an additional 30 min at 3 min intervals to verify luminesce signal of all
samples decayed at the same rate.
Real-time assays. HeLa IVT reactions were prepared by addition nGlow substrate to the cell-free translation
mix with a 1:10 v/v ratio. Before the addition of mRNA and/or NSP1, the IVT reactions were transferred to nonadjacent wells in a 384-well plate and equilibrated to 30°C in the plate reader. All other reagents were maintained
at 30°C and then added to the IVT reactions according to the order-of-addition assay schematic outlined in Fig.
1D. The preincubation (30°C, 2 min) was performed in the plate reader. Kinetic monitoring of the samples (36

min, 15 s intervals) was initiated during the equilibration step. Reagent additions and plate transfer times were
noted during the experiment and used to post-synchronize t0 to
mRNA addition. Data was analyzed in MatLab using the approach developed by Vassilenko et al.25. The raw data
was smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filtering (frame length ≤ 5, 2nd degree polynomial) to maintain the shape and
magnitude of the raw data. The plateau value of the 1st derivative of the smoothed curve is equal to the synthesis
rate25,61. Mean synthesis time, which is lag time between mRNA addition and the initial detection of nLuc signal, is
the sum of initiation, elongation, and termination time. Synthesis times were extracted from the data by fitting the
2nd derivative of the smoothed data to a Gaussian distribution using the equation
𝑥−𝑏 !
𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑎 ∗ 𝑒 +− 0 1
𝑐
where 𝑎 = amplitude, 𝑏 = centroid (median), 𝑐 = variance25,62. Statistical analysis of the real-time nLuc activity was
done as described above.
Native gel assays
Native composite agarose-acrylamide gels were prepared as described63. Briefly, 2.75% acrylamide (37.5:1),
0.5% Nusieve GTG agarose composite gels were prepared in the following buffer: 25 mM Tris-OAc pH 7.5, 4 mM
KOAc, 2 mM Mg(OAc)2, 0.5 mM DTT, 2.5% glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) TEMED, and 0.1% (v/v) fresh ammonium
persulfate. The gels were cooled at 4 °C for 20 minutes and allowed to further polymerize at room temperature for
90 min. Prior to removal of combs, gels were placed at 4 °C for 15 min. Gels were run in ice-cold running buffer
(25 mM Tris-OAc pH 7.5, 4 mM KOAc, and 2 mM Mg(OAC)2) for 30-60 min at 4 °C. All assays were repeated at
least three times. For complex formation, the indicated components were incubated in ribosome assay buffer (30
mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 100 mM KOAc, 2 mM Mg(OAc)2) at 37 °C for 15 minutes. Unless noted, NSP1 with a
C-terminal ybbR tag conjugated to a Cy5 dye was used in all gel shift experiments, as C-terminally tagged NSP1
from SARS-CoV was functional in cellular assays12 and Cy5 provides cleaner signal upon image acquisition with
a Typhoon imager. For competition experiments, the competitor protein was pre-incubated with ribosomal
subunits at 37 °C for 15 minutes, prior to addition of the labeled protein.
Purification of human eIFs
eIF1 and eIF1A. Plasmids for the expression of recombinant human eIF1 and eIF1A were gifted by
Christopher S. Fraser (UC Davis). Detailed cloning and recombinant protein expression and purification methods
have been described previously55. Changes made to the eIF1 and eIF1A purification scheme include use of a
HiTrap SP-HP (Cytiva Lifesciences, #17115201) column for the IEX chromatography step and the addition of a
SEC step in which fractions eluted from the IEX column containing either eIF1 or eIF1A, as determined by SDSPAGE analysis, were pooled and passed over a Superdex 75 10/300 (Cytiva, #17-5174-01) column to remove
protein oligomers/aggregates and exchange purified factors into a storage buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mM
KOAc, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 10% glycerol (v/v)). Purified factors were concentrated to ~ 200 μM using a
Millipore centrifugal filter and stored at -80°C.
eIF2 and eIF3. Endogenous initiation factor complexes were purified from 400 mL of HeLa post-nuclear
extract that was kindly donated to our group by Robert Tijan (UC Berkeley) using previously detailed methods55,64.
Additional guidance was received from Christopher S. Fraser (UC Davis).
eIF5. The expression and purification of recombinant eIF5 was carried out using a using a modified protocol
based on previously established methods65. Alterations to the protocol included substitution of the MonoQ column
with a HiTrap Q HP column (Cytiva Lifesciences, #29051325) for the anion exchange chromatography step, and
adding a SEC step using a Superdex 200 10/300 (Cytiva Lifesciences, 28-9909-44) column to exchange purified
eIF5 in to a storage buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mM KOAc, 1 mM DTT, and 10% glycerol (v/v).
eIF3j. Human eIF3j was expressed and purified as done for NSP1, with the following changes. Human eIF3j
was codon optimized for expression in E. coli and cloned with an N-terminal 6xHis tag and TEV protease

cleavage site into a pET28b vector at the NcoI site. Protein was expressed by induction with 0.5 mM IPTG
overnight at 17 °C. Following cleavage of the 6xHis tag and the subtractive Ni-NTA step, eIF3j was subjected to a
final purification step using SEC on a 23 mL Superdex 75 10/300 (Cytiva, #17-5174-01) column equilibrated in
storage buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 150 mM KOAc, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mM DTT). Fractions with
purified eIF3j were identified via SDS-PAGE, concentrated, flash frozen, and stored at -80 °C.
tRNAi. Human tRNAi was transcribed from a DNA template with a 5'-end T7 promoter and hammer head
ribozyme55. The plasmid was linearized via digestion with BstNI for transcriptional termination at the 3'-CCA of
tRNAi. Purified and linearized plasmid was used as the template for in vitro transcription with T7 polymerase at 37
°C for 4 hrs at 16 mM MgCl2, during which the ribozyme self-cleaved (>80% efficiency). Mature tRNAi was
separated from pre-cursor RNA and cleaved ribozyme via 10% acrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of
8M urea. After excision of the tRNAi band, the RNA was extracted 3x at room temperature for 12 hrs with 300 M
ammonium acetate, and ethanol precipitated. tRNAi was resuspended in 10 mM NaCl,10 mM Bis-tris, pH 7.0 and
stored at -80°C. To charge tRNAi with methionine, 100 µL of 60μM human tRNAi transcript was mixed with 618.6
µL ddH2O, and heated at 95 °C for 2 min, then immediately chilled on ice for 5 min. The resulting solution was
mixed with 200 µL of 5x charging buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 50 mM Mg(OAc)2, 5 mM DTT), 20 µL 100 mM
ATP, 30 µL 10 mM L-methionine, 2 µL 1 M Mg(OAc)2 and 29.4 µL 34 µM yeast MetRS66, and incubated at 30 °C
for 45 min. The charging reaction was stopped by addition of 100 µL 3M NaOAc pH5.2. The resulting tRNA was
purified by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, pH 5.2) extraction and ethanol precipitation. The pellet
was resuspended with tRNA storage buffer (10 mM NaOAc pH 5.2, 50 mM Mg(OAc)2) and further purified by
passing through BioRad P-6 columns that were equilibrated with tRNA storage buffer. The charging efficiency
was ≈70% based on acid urea PAGE analyses67 of the final tRNA product.
Real-time single-molecule assays using ZMWs
ZMW-based imaging. All real-time imaging was conducted using a modified Pacific Biosciences RSII DNA
sequencer, which was described previously30. Unless otherwise noted, Cy3 dyes were excited using the 532 nm
excitation laser at 0.6 µW/µm2. Cy5 and Cy5.5 dyes were excited with the 642 nm laser at 0.1 µW/µm2. In nearly
all experiments, data were collected at 10 frames per second. The exception was when the 532 nm laser was
used at 0.16 µW/µm2; in this case, data were collected at 3 fps to increase signal to noise ratios. ZMW chips were
purchased from Pacific Biosciences. Prior to imaging, all ZMW chips were washed with 0.2% Tween-20 and TP50
buffer (50 mM Tris-OAc pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl). Washed chips were coated with neutravidin by a 5 min incubation
with 1 µM neutravidin diluted in TP50 buffer supplemented with 1.3 µM of DNA blocking oligos and 0.7 mg mL-1
UltraPure BSA. Chips were washed with TP50 and ribosome assay buffer (30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 100 mM
KOAc, 2 mM Mg(OAc)2). For imaging, the ribosome assay buffer was supplemented with casein (62.5 µg mL-1)
and an oxygen scavenging system68: 2 mM TSY, 2 mM protocatechuic acid (PCA), and 0.06 U/µL
protocatechuate-3,4-dioxygenase (PCD). In all real-time single-molecule experiments, fluorescently-labeled NSP1
with an N-terminal ybbR tag was used, since it had translation inhibition and 40S-binding activities similar to the
wild-type protein.
Tethered eIF1–40S and eIF1–eIF3j–40S complexes (Figure 2). Prior to tethering, 200 nM biotin-40S subunits
were incubated in ribosome assay buffer with 6 µM eIF1 at 37 °C for 20 min. For tethering, 1 nM of pre-formed
complexes (by biotin-40S) were incubated on the neutravidin-coated ZMW surface for 15 min at room
temperature. Non-tethered complexes were washed away with ribosome assay buffer prior to imaging. Upon start
of data acquisition and in the presence of 1 µM eIF1, Cy3-NSP1 was added at the indicated concentrations and
temperatures. In experiments with eIF3j, 2.5 µM eIF3j was pre-incubated for ~5 min with tethered ribosomal
complexes prior to addition of ybbR-NSP1 labeled with Cy3 dye (‘Cy3-NSP1’). Temperatures and laser powers
were as indicated.
Tethered ribosomal pre-initiation complexes (Figure 2). Complexes were formed by incubating 40 nM biotin40S subunits in ribosome assay buffer with the indicated eIFs at 37 °C for 15 min. eIF concentrations were: 1 µM
for eIF1, eIF1A, & eIF5; and 200 nM for TC-GMPPNP & eIF3. Tethering was conducted as above. As indicated,
imaging was conducted in the presence of: 1 µM eIF1, eIF1A, & eIF5; 100 nM TC-GMPPNP; and 50 nM eIF3.
Upon start of data acquisition at 30 °C, Cy3-NSP1 was added at 25 nM final concentration.

Tethered 40S–HCV IRES complexes (Figure 3). The indicated HCV IRES RNAs were diluted to 200 nM in
refolding buffer (20 mM cacodylate-NaOH pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, and 1 mM EDTA), heated to 95 °C for 2 min, and
slow cooled to room temperature (~45 min). Once cooled, 4 mM Mg(OAc)2 was added to quench the EDTA, and
RNAs were stored on ice until use. To form complexes, 75 nM of 40S-RACK1-Cy5 subunits were incubated in
ribosome assay buffer with 20 nM of the indicated IRES RNAs at 37 °C for 20 min. As indicated (‘+eIFs’), 1 µM
eIF1, 1 µM eIF1A, 1 µM eIF5, 300 nM TC-GMPPNP, and 240 nM eIF3 were included. Tethering was performed
as above, except 1 nM of complex was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Upon start of data acquisition at
30 °C, Cy3-NSP1 was added at 25 nM final concentration. As indicated (+eIFs), data acquisition was performed in
the presence of 1 µM eIF1, 1 µM eIF1A, 1 µM eIF5, 200 nM TC-GMPPNP, and 150 nM eIF3.
Tethered M+41–40S subunit complexes (Figure 3). The biotinylated model mRNA (M+41) and Cy5-labeled
model mRNA (M+41-Cy5) were described previously38. To form complexes with M+41, 40 nM 40S-RACK1-Cy5
subunits were incubated in ribosome assay buffer with 500 nM M+41, 1 µM eIF1, 1 µM eIF1A, 1µM eIF5, and 400
nM TC-GMPPNP at 37 °C for 20 min. Tethering was performed as above, except 1 nM of complex was incubated
for 10 min at room temperature. Upon start of data acquisition at 30 °C, Cy3-NSP1 was added at 25 nM final
concentration in the presence of 1 µM eIF1, 1 µM eIF1A, 1 µM eIF5, and 200 nM TC-GMPPNP. For M+41-Cy5,
conditions were identical except TC-GMPPNP was present at 200 nM and 100 nM during complex formation and
imaging, respectively; and, eIF3 was included at 200 nM and 50 nM. eIF3 was included in these experiments to
promote complex formation, which was inefficient.
Tethered 40S–CrPV and 80S–CrPV complexes (Figure 4). CrPV IRES RNAs were refolded as with the HCV
IRES. To form 40S–CrPV IRES complexes, 40S-uS19-Cy3 subunits at 75 nM were incubated in ribosome assay
buffer with 20 nM of the indicated RNA at 37 °C for 15 min. To form 80S–CrPV IRES complexes, 75 nM 40SuS19-Cy3, 150 nM 60S-uL18-Cy5, and 20 nM RNA were incubated. Tethering was performed as with the 40S–
HCV complexes. Upon start of data acquisition at 30 °C, Cy5.5-NSP1 was added at 25 nM final concentration.
Addition of NSP1–40S subunit complexes (Figure 5). HCV and CrPV IRES RNAs were refolded as above. To
form NSP1–40S subunit complexes, 550 nM Cy5.5-NSP1 was incubated in ribosome assay buffer with 275 nM
40S-uS19-Cy3 subunits at 37 °C for 15 min. To tether biotinylated RNAs, 0.16 nM of refolded IRES was
incubated on the neutravidin-coated ZMW surface for 5 min. Upon start of data acquisition at 30 °C, either 15 nM
of 40S-Cy3 subunits alone or 15 nM of Cy5.5-NSP1–40S-Cy3 pre-formed complexes (final concentrations) were
added.
Data analysis. Experimental movies that captured fluorescence intensities over time were processed using
custom MATLAB scripts, as described previously29,30. Briefly, ZMWs with the desired fluorescence signals were
identified by filtering for the signals at appropriate time points. Individual binding events were assigned manually
based on the appearance and disappearance of the respective fluorescence signals. Unless noted, only the first
NSP1 binding event longer than 4-5 s that occurred within the first 500 s of imaging was analyzed. Unless
intractable due to complex stability or inhibition, approximately 200-300 single molecules were analyzed, indicated
by single-step photobleach events. Association times were defined as the time elapsed from the addition of the
labeled component until a burst of fluorescence for that component. The time of addition is controlled by the
instrument and varies from experiment to experiment, but typically occurs within the first 10 s of data acquisition.
Lifetimes were defined as the duration of the corresponding fluorescence signal.
Kinetic parameters were extracted by fitting observed data to single- or double-exponential functions as
described30. On some complexes, the presence of a large, slow association phase made it difficult to derive
reliable rates, as amplitudes for the association rates are assigned semi-arbitrarily during the fits. When this
occurred, comparisons of median association times were used instead, which better reflected the raw data. In the
results section, this is indicated by ‘median association times’, which only pertains to the indicated final
concentration of NSP1. When possible, observed association rates derived from fits to exponential functions were
reported, which are indicated by ‘apparent kon-1’ and were converted to times to facilitate comparisons across
experiments where medians are reported. Regardless, all derived association rates, median association times,
lifetimes, and the number of molecules examined are reported in Supplementary Tables 2-5. As indicated in the
tables, fits to linear functions were used to estimate very slow association rates observed when NSP1 association
was inhibited.

Statistical analyses. To calculate errors for NSP1 binding efficiency (e.g., Figure 3E), bootstrap analyses (n =
10,000) were performed to calculate 99% confidence intervals (C.I.) for the observed proportions using R. To
calculate errors for median association times and lifetimes, bootstrap analyses (n = 10,000) were performed to
calculate 95% C.I. of the observed median using MATLAB. Reported errors for derived rates represent 95% C.I.
yielded from fits to linear, single-exponential, or double-exponential functions, as indicated.
Equilibrium single-molecule analyses using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM)
Our home-built, prism-based TIRFM instrument has been described previously68–70. All data were collected at
room temperature at 10 frames per second with the EM gain set to 650. To form NSP1–40S subunit complexes,
40 nM biotin-40S subunits were incubated in ribosome assay buffer with 500 nM NSP1-ybbR-Cy5 and 6 µM eIF1
at 37 °C for 15 min. Pre-formed complexes were tethered to the surface of a neutravidin-coated quartz slide as
with ZMWs above. Buffer conditions during TIRFM imaging were identical to those with ZMWs. During imaging
via excitation with the 647 nm laser, 1 µM eIF1 and 4 nM NSP1-Cy5 (C-terminal ybbR tag) were present. To form
80S–IRES complexes, 100 nM of refolded CrPV IRES60 biotinylated on the 3'-terminus was incubated in ribosome
assay buffer with 250 nM 40S-uS19-Cy3 and 750 nM 60S-uL18-Cy5 subunits. The complex was tethered as
above at 1 nM. Emission data were collected in both the Cy3 (donor) and Cy5 (acceptor) channels following
excitation of the Cy3 donor dye with the 532 nm laser. Co-localized molecules were identified and analyzed using
custom MATLAB scripts. FRET events were assigned manually to a single state, with single molecules indicated
by single-step photobleach events of the donor fluorophore. Background fluorescence intensities were corrected
and normalized, and the gamma-corrected FRET efficiency distribution was calculated as described71.
Ribosome purifications and labeling
40S and 60S ribosomal subunits were purified from the indicated cell lines and labeled with biotin or dyes as
described29. To specifically install biotin on the ribosomal subunit, purified 40S-RACK1-ybbR subunits were
incubated with 4-fold molar excess PEG11-biotin (ThermoFisher #21911) conjugated to co-enzyme A (CoA) and 2fold molar excess Sfp synthase enzyme. To install fluorophores, purified 40S-RACK1-ybbR, 40S-uS19-ybbR, and
60S-uL18-ybbR subunits were incubated with 4-fold molar excess Cy3 or Cy5 dyes conjugated to CoA and 2-fold
molar excess of Sfp synthase. All reactions proceeded for 90 min at 37 °C. To remove free biotin, dyes, and/or
Sfp synthase, reactions were layered onto a low-salt sucrose cushion (30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 100 mM
KOAc, 0.5 M sucrose, 5 mM Mg(OAc)2, and 2 mM DTT), and centrifuged at 287,582 x g (90,000 rpm) for 1 hr at 4
°C in a TLA100.2 rotor (Beckman, ref. 362046) in 11x34 mm thick-wall polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tubes
(Beckman, ref. 343788). Ribosome pellets were washed once and subsequently resuspended with ribosome
storage buffer (30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 100 mM KOAc, 5 mM Mg(OAc)2, 6% (v/v) sucrose, and 2 mM DTT),
aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C.
RNA in vitro transcriptions
HCV & CrPV IRES RNAs. Purified PCR products were used as the templates for in vitro transcription with the
T7 MEGAScript T7 Transcription kit (ThermoFisher #AMB13345). Standard reaction conditions were used, except
each nucleotide was present at a final concentration of 4 mM and the reaction was supplemented with 6 mM of 5'biotin-G-Monophosphate (Trilink, #N-6003). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 hours. Transcribed RNAs
were purified using the GeneJET RNA Purification Kit (ThermoFisher, #K0732).
Reporter mRNAs for IVT assays. Linearized plasmids were used as templates for in vitro transcription with
the MessageMAX T7 ARCA-Capped Message Transcription Kit (Cell Script, # CMMA60710). Transcription
reactions were setup using standard conditions and then incubated at 37ºC for 30 min. Transcripts were purified
using the MEGAclear Transcription Clean-up Kit (ThermoFisher, AM1908). The integrity and homogeneity of the
reporter mRNAs were verified via native- and denaturing-PAGE.
CRISPR-Cas9 & Homology-directed repair
Sequences. To generate the 40S-uS19-ybbR and 60S-uL18-ybbR cell lines, the guide sequences
CGCAACACTCACCATCTTGC (uS19/RPS15) and AAAAATCATAGAAAATTGCT (uL18/RPL5) were cloned into

the pX458 vector backbone using the published approach72. To insert the tandem ybbR and flag tags onto the
endogenous copies of the genes, single-stranded DNA ultramer repair templates were purchased from Integrated
DNA Technologies that contained about 40-60 nts of flanking sequence on either side of the desired insertion.
See Supplementary Table 6 for all guide oligo, repair template, and PCR screening oligo sequences.
Transfections, sorting, & screening overview. Approximately 24 h post seeding in a well of a 6-well plate, lowconfluency (~30%) wild-type HEK293T cells were transiently transfected (Liopfectamine 3000, ThermoFisher)
with 1 µg of the relevant pX458 plasmid and 2 µg of ssDNA repair template. Cells were allowed to recover for 48
hrs. Single, eGFP-positive cells were sorted at the Stanford Shared FACS Facility into a well of a 96-well plate
that contained 50% conditioned DMEM(high glucose) medium. Individual colonies were allowed to recover until
they were visible by eye (approximately 1.5-2 weeks), upon which colonies were transferred to a well of a 24-well
plate. Once confluent, colonies were screened via PCR, Sanger sequencing, and Western blot analyses.
Successfully edited cell lines were expanded and ultimately stored as stocks in 5% DMSO-FBS solution.
PCR screening & Sanger sequencing. Genomic DNA was isolated from candidate cell lines using the
QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution (Lucigen, #QE09050) essentially as described, except 10 µL of
resuspended cells were added to 50 µL of QuickExtract solution. Following extraction, 1 µL of gDNA was added
to a standard 24 µL 2X GoTaq Green PCR (Promega, #M7123), typically ~35 cycles. Sequences for uS19 and
uL18 screening oligos are available in Supplementary Table 6. Following amplification, PCRs were analyzed
using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR products with the desired insertion size were submitted for Sanger
sequencing, following their purification.
Western blots. Whole cell lysates were analyzed via 4-20% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF
membranes. All antibodies were diluted in 5% Blotting-Grade Blocker (BioRad, #1706404) in TBST buffer. The
following primary antibodies were used: anti-RPS15/uS19 at 1:500 from Abcam (ab168361); and, anti-RPL5 at
1:500 from GeneTex (GTX101821). Incubations with primary antibodies were for > 12 h at 4 °C. The secondary
antibody was GeneTex Rabbit IgG antibody (HRP) (GTX213110-01) and was used at 1:10,000. Blots were
imaged via chemiluminescence.
Polysome profiling assays
Polysome profiling assays were performed as described29 and in duplicate for the indicated cell lines.
Cell lines and growth
HAP1 cells that express RACK1-yybR were described previously29. HAP1 cells were grown at 37 °C with 5%
CO2 in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM) (Gibco, #sh30228) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal
bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), and 1X penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). Wild-type HEK293T cells were
purchased from ATCC (CRL-3216) and engineered HEK293T cells are described here. All HEK293T cell lines
were grown as HAP1 cells except Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) High Glucose medium (Gibco,
#11965092) was used instead. Cell lines were not tested for mycobacterium.
Data sharing plan
All plasmids, data, and custom analysis scripts are available upon reasonable request.
Structural models
All structural models were rendered using ChimeraX73. The following PDB models were used: 4UG074,
5A2Q35, and 6ZLW31.

(KH164-164, red box) are highlighted. Based on recent structural studies, the C-terminal amino acids that dock within the mRNA entry
channel of the 40S subunit are bolded. NCBI GenBank accessions are, respectively: MN997409.1, AY508724, JX869059, and
KF636752.
B). Image of a gel that depicts recombinantly-expressed and purified SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 proteins examined using SDS-PAGE on a
12% acrylamide gel. The NSP1 mutant protein with KH164-165 substituted to alanine (KH/AA) runs at a different apparent molecular
weight relative to the wild-type (WT) or RK124-125 to alanine (RK/AA) mutant.

A). Schematic of site-specific, enzymatic attachment of fluorescent cyanine dyes or biotin to the ybbR peptide tag by Sfp synthase.
B). Image of purified and fluorescently-labeled NSP1 analyzed via SDS-PAGE. N-terminally tagged ‘ybbR-NSP1’ was labeled with Cy3
fluorescent dye, and C-terminally tagged ‘NSP1-ybbR’ was labeled with Cy5 dye. The image depicts total protein stained with
Coomassie blue (left) after scanning the gel for Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence (right), shown as an overlay of the fluorescent signals. The
doublet in the NSP1-ybbR sample likely represents separation of the dye-labeled (upper band) from the non-dye-labeled protein (lower
band) in the 12% acrylamide gel.
C). Representative fluorescence image of a gel that depicts NSP1-ybbR-Cy5 association with purified and non-labeled human 40S
ribosomal subunits at the indicated concentrations, as determined using native gel electrophoresis. NSP1-ybbR-Cy5 was present at 40
nM (by Cy5). Samples were incubated at 37 ºC for 10 minutes prior to native gel electrophoresis at 4 ºC. n = 3.
D). Representative fluorescence image of a gel that depicts NSP1-ybbR-Cy5 association with the indicated purified ribosomal subunits,
as determined using native gel electrophoresis. 40 nM of NSP1-ybbR-Cy5 was incubated with 128 nM of the indicated subunits at 37
ºC for 10 minutes prior to native gel electrophoresis analysis at 4 ºC. n = 3.
E). Representative fluorescence image of a gel that depicts NSP1-ybbR-Cy5 association with purified human 40S ribosomal subunits in
the presence of the indicated competitor proteins present at 150-fold molar excess, as determined using native gel electrophoresis at 4
ºC. While unlabeled NSP1(WT) and NSP1(RK/AA) eliminated the 40S-NSP1-Cy5 band, substitution of KH to AA in unlabeled NSP1
yielded a strong 40S-NSP1-Cy5 band, similar to experiments in the absence of competitor protein. Thus, NSP1(KH/AA) was unable to
associate stably with the human 40S subunit, as expected based on NSP1 from SARS-CoV-1. n = 3.

subunits in the presence of the indicated competitor proteins at 150-fold molar excess, as determined using native gel electrophoresis

C). Plot of the mean integrated densities of the indicated bands from the experiment depicted in panel B. At all examined
concentrations, the presence of eIF1 increased the intensity of the 40S-NSP1-Cy5 band about 2-fold (mean fold increase = 2 ± 0.4).
Error bars represent standard deviation of the mean. See Supplementary Table 1 for raw data, calculated means, and standard
deviations. n = 3.
D). Representative fluorescence image of a gel that depicts increased migration of the eIF1A–40S subunit complex in composite native

Supp. Figure 4. NSP1 bound 40S subunits within pre-initiation complexes. Related to Fig. 2.
A). Model of the human 40S ribosomal subunit (PDB: 5A2Q). The 40S subunit is depicted in gray and the ribosomal protein RACK1 is
in purple.
B). Schematic of the zero-mode-waveguide (ZMW) imaging setup. One PacBio SMRT cell contains approximately 150,000 individual
ZMWs, which enable direct monitoring of up to four fluorescent signals at concentrations up to 5 µM. The instrument (a PacBio RSII
DNA sequencer) enables control of both experimental temperature and the power of the excitation lasers. In this scenario, purified 40S
ribosomal subunits that contained RACK1 with a C-terminal ybbR-tag were purified from human cells. In the presence of Sfp synthase,
PEG11-biotin conjugated to co-enzyme A (co-A) was site-specifically attached to the first serine residue in the 11 amino acid ybbR tag
(DSLEFIASKLA) on RACK1. Biotinylated 40S subunits (biotin-40S) were incubated with 30-fold molar excess eIF1 at 37 ºC for 15
minutes. eIF1–40S subunit complexes were tethered to the neutravidin-coated ZMW surface via the high-affinity biotin–neutravidin
interaction. After washing away non-tethered components, data acquisition began at 20 ºC and Cy3-NSP1 was added. In this cartoon,
ZMWs that contained a Cy3-NSP1 binding event during the experimental time frame are green, and ZMWs that lacked a binding event
are gray.
C). Translation inhibition activity of the labeled proteins. Plot of mean nLuc signal from IVT reactions programed with GAPDH reporter
mRNA in the absence of NSP1 or the presence of 0.4 μM of WT, N-terminally (ybbR-NSP1), or C-terminally tagged (NSP1-ybbR)
NSP1. Error bars represent SEM. n = 3.
D). Representative fluorescence image of a gel that compares N-terminally (ybbR-NSP1) and C-terminally tagged (NSP1-ybbR) NSP1
association with purified human 40S ribosomal subunits. The Cy5 (left) and Cy3 (right) images were run in parallel on the same gel, but
they were separated here for clarity. Wild-type, unlabeled NSP1 or eIF1 was added at 6 µM. 40 nM of labeled NSP1 (either Cy5-labeled
or Cy3-labeled) was present. n = 3.
E). Schematic of total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) experiments performed at equilibrium. Biotinylated 40S
(biotin-40S) subunits were incubated with 12-fold molar excess of NSP1-Cy5 and 150-fold excess eIF1 at 37 ºC for 15 minutes. Preformed complexes were incubated on a TIRFM surface coated with neutravidin. After washing away unbound complexes and
components, we imaged tethered ribosomal complexes at room temperature in the presence of 1 µM eIF1 and 4 nM of NSP1-Cy5. We
observed a few hundred NSP1-Cy5 molecules tethered to the imaging surface in all view fields examined (representative view field
shown, n = 18). Consistent with specific tethering, NSP1-Cy5 signal was eliminated by pre-saturation of the imaging surface with 110
mM biotin.
F). Example single-molecule fluorescence trace from the left view field of the equilibrium TRIFM experiment outlined in panel E (no
biotin pre-treatment). The trace begins with fluorescence signal from NSP1-Cy5 (red) bound to a tethered eIF1–40S subunit complex.
G). Plot of the cumulative probability of Cy3-NSP1 association times at the indicated concentrations with tethered eIF1–40S subunit
complexes at 20 ºC. The left plot depicts all association times, and the right plot highlights the subset within the dashed box of the left
plot. Lines represent fits to single-exponential functions. See Supplementary Table 2 for samples sizes and the parameters for
relevant fits.
H). Plot of the cumulative probability of (left) and median (right) Cy3-NSP1 lifetimes on eIF1–40S subunit complexes at 20 ºC and the
indicated excitation laser powers. Cy3-NSP1 was added at 25 nM. The wavelength of the excitation laser was 532 nm, and it was used
at high (0.6 µW/ µm2), medium (0.32 µW/ µm2), and low (0.16 µW/ µm2) power to determine whether the lifetime of the NSP1
fluorescence signal was limited by the photostability of the Cy3 dye. Lines represent (left plot) fits to exponential functions. Error bars
(right plot) represent 95% C.I. of the median values. See panel I for example traces. See Supplementary Table 2 for samples sizes
and the parameters for relevant fits.
I). Example single-molecule fluorescence trace that depicts association of Cy3-NSP1 (green) with a tethered eIF1–40S subunit complex
acquired at different laser powers. The wavelength of the excitation laser was 532 nm, and it was used at high (0.6 µW/ µm2), medium
(0.32 µW/ µm2), and low (0.16 µW/ µm2) power to determine whether the lifetime of the Cy3-NSP1 fluorescence signal was limited by
the photostability of the Cy3 dye. During imaging, eIF1 was present at 1 µM. Loss of fluorescence due to likely photobleaching of the
Cy3 dye is indicated on each trace.
J). Plot of the cumulative probability of Cy3-NSP1 association times with tethered eIF1–40S subunit complexes at the indicated
temperatures. In all experiments, Cy3-NSP1 was present at 25 nM. The left plot depicts all association times, and the right plot
highlights the subset within the dashed box of the left plot. Lines represent fits to double-exponential functions. See Supplementary
Table 2 for samples sizes and the parameters for relevant fits.
K). Plot of the cumulative probability of Cy3-NSP1 association times with the indicated ribosomal pre-initiation complexes. In all
experiments, Cy3-NSP1 was present at 25 nM and the temperature was 30 ºC. The dashed box represents the region of the plot
displayed in Fig. 2F. Lines represent fits to double-exponential functions. See Supplementary Table 2 for samples sizes and the
parameters for relevant fits.
L). Plot of the cumulative probability of Cy3-NSP1 lifetimes on the indicated 40S pre-initiation complexes. In all experiments, Cy3-NSP1
was present at 25 nM and the temperature was 30 ºC. See Supplementary Table 2 for samples sizes and medians with 95% C.I..

RACK1 in light yellow, and NSP1 in purple.
B). Model of the human 40S subunit bound by the HCV IRES (PDB: 5A2Q). The 40S subunit is depicted in gray, RACK1 in light yellow,

channel of the 40S subunit empty. Domain II of the IRES holds the head of the 40S subunit in the open conformation.
C). Plot of the cumulative probability of Cy3-NSP1 association times with 40S subunit complexes. In all experiments, Cy3-NSP1 was
present at 25 nM and the temperature was 30 ºC. The data for the 40S subunit alone (40S) and the eIF1–40S subunit complex (40S–
eIF1) were replotted here from Fig. 2F and Supp. Fig. 4K to provide easy comparison to the data for NSP1 association with the 40S–
HCV+0 complex. Lines represent fits to single- or double-exponential functions. See Supplementary Table 3 for samples sizes and the

Supplementary Table 3 for samples sizes, medians with 95% C.I., and parameters for fits.
F). Schematic of the single-molecule fluorescence experimental setup with biotinylated M+41 model mRNA. 40S ribosomal subunits
were labeled with Cy5 dye via RACK1-ybbR. M+41 RNA was labeled on the 3'-terminus with biotin. Pre-formed M+41–40S-Cy5
complexes were tethered to the ZMW imaging surface in the presence of eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3, eIF5, and TC-GMPPNP. At the start of
data acquisition, Cy3-NSP1 was added at 25 nM at 30 °C.
G). Example single-molecule fluorescence trace that depicts a tethered M+41–40S-Cy5 complex and subsequent association of Cy3NSP1. The 40S subunit and ybbR-NSP1 were labeled with Cy5 (red) and Cy3 (green) dyes, respectively. Raw fluorescence intensities
were corrected in this image to set baseline intensities to zero for presentation. The association time (Dt) was defined as time elapsed
from the addition of Cy3-NSP1 until the burst of Cy3 fluorescence (green), which signified NSP1 association. The lifetime was defined
as the duration of the Cy3 fluorescence signal.
H). Schematic of the single-molecule fluorescence experimental setup with fluorescently-labeled M+41 model mRNA. 40S ribosomal
subunits were labeled with biotin via RACK1-ybbR. M+41 RNA was labeled on the 3'-terminus with Cy5. Pre-formed Cy5-M+41–40S

J, K). Cumulative probability plots of the observed association times (panel J) and lifetimes (panel K) of Cy3-NSP1 with the indicated
40S–mRNA complexes. Biotinylated 40S subunits (as in Fig. 2 & Supp. Fig. 4) were directly tethered to the surface in the presence of
the model mRNA (M+41) labeled on the 3’-terminus with Cy5 and eIFs 1,1A, 5, and TC-GMPPNP. Both sets of molecules plotted were

Supp. Figure 6. Generation of an inter-subunit FRET signal for the human ribosome. Related to Fig. 4.
A). Image of a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The analyzed PCR products were generated with primers that flanked
the desired insertion site for the ybbR-flag tag, with at least one of them lying outside the repair template.
B). Image of Western blots using the indicated antibodies on whole cell extract from the indicated cell lines. Together with the PCR data
from panel B, these data indicated that all endogenous copies of uS19 or uL18 were edited to incorporate ybbR-flag tags. The faint
band that may represent endogenous uS19 in the ybbR-uS19 sample of the Western blot could result from translation initiation at the
original start codon, rather than the new, inserted start codon.
C, D). Traces from Sanger sequencing of PCR products generated as in panel B for the indicated cell lines and genomic loci. Important
regions within the sequenced DNA segments are annotated. For both ybbR-uS19 and uL18-ybbR cell lines, the ybbR-flag tag was
inserted as designed and the used PAM sites were disrupted, as encoded in the repair templates.
E). Representative traces from polysome profiling assays on the indicated cell lines. The positions of monosomes (individual ribosomal
subunits and single 80S ribosomes) and polysomes (multiple 80S ribosomes) are indicated. Similar levels of polysomes were detected
in wild-type, ybbR-uS19, and uL18-ybbR HEK293t cell lines. Thus, ribosomes that contain the ybbR-flag tag on uS19 or uL18 were
functional. n = 2.
F). Gel that depicts purified and fluorescently-labeled ribosomal subunits. Ribosomal subunits were purified from either the HEK293T
cell line that expressed ybbR-uS19 (40S-ybbR & 60S samples) or uL18-ybbR (40S & 60S-ybbR samples). Following ybbR-labeling
reactions with either Cy3 (green) or Cy5 (red) dyes, ribosomal subunits were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels. Prior to
staining total protein with Coomassie blue (left image), gels were scanned for both Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence (right image), which is
presented as an overlay of both fluorescent signals.

the CrPV IRES, which is present in the ribosomal A site. All RNAs were biotinylated on the 5'-terminus.
B). Example single-molecule fluorescence trace that depicts addition of Cy5.5-NSP1 to tethered 40S–CrPV+1 complexes. The 40S
subunit was labeled with Cy3 (green) and NSP1 with Cy5.5 (magenta). Due to bleed through across the three fluorescent channels, the
Cy3, Cy5, and Cy5.5 signals were made transparent before and after relevant events for presentation here. The association time (Dt)
was defined as the time elapsed from the addition of Cy5.5-NSP1 until the burst of Cy5.5 fluorescence (magenta), which signified NSP1
association. The lifetime was defined as the duration of the Cy5.5 fluorescence signal.
C). Plot of the fraction of the indicated ribosome–IRES complexes bound at least once by NSP1 for ≥ ≈ 5s. Error bars represent 95%
C.I. yielded from bootstrapping analyses.

Supp. Figure 8. NSP1 remained bound to 40S subunits upon association with model mRNAs. Related to Fig. 5.
A). Schematic of the single-molecule fluorescence experimental setup with the HCV IRES. 40S ribosomal subunits were labeled with
Cy3 dye via uS19-ybbR. When indicated, NSP1–40S subunit complexes were pre-formed by incubating 2-fold molar excess Cy5.5NSP1 with 40S-Cy3 subunits at 37 °C for 15 minutes. After tethering of HCV+0 or HCV+48 model RNAs in ZMWs and start of data
acquisition, a final concentration of 15 nM (by 40S subunits) 40S-Cy3 subunits or NSP1–40S subunit complexes were added at 30 °C.
B,C). Example single-molecule fluorescence traces that depict association of NSP1–40S subunit complexes with tethered HCV+0
(panel B) or HCV+48 (panel C) IRES molecules. The 40S subunit and NSP1 were labeled with Cy3 (green) and Cy5.5 (magenta) dyes,
respectively. Raw fluorescence intensities were corrected in this image to set baseline intensities to zero for presentation. These traces
depict the full duration of data acquisition. In both, a single NSP1–40S subunit complex associates with the HCV IRES. Following initial
loss of NSP1 signal, NSP1 readily re-associated with the same 40S–HCV+0 complex but not the 40S–HCV+48 complex.
D). Cumulative probability plot of observed association times of either 40S subunits alone or NSP1–40S subunit complexes with the
indicated model RNAs at 30 ºC. Lines represent fits to double-exponential functions. See Supplementary Table 5 for samples sizes
and the parameters for relevant fits.
E,F). Cumulative probability plots of 40S subunit (panel E) and NSP1 (panel F) lifetimes on the indicated model RNAs at 30 ºC. See
Supplementary Table 5 for samples sizes and medians with 95% C.I..
G). Schematic of the single-molecule fluorescence experimental setup with the CrPV IRES. 40S ribosomal subunits were labeled with
Cy3 dye via uS19-ybbR. When indicated, NSP1–40S subunit complexes were pre-formed by incubating 2-fold molar excess Cy5.5NSP1 with 40S-Cy3 subunits at 37 °C for 15 minutes. After tethering of CrPV+1 or CrPV+48 model RNAs in ZMWs and start of data
acquisition, a final concentration of 15 nM (by 40S subunits) 40S-Cy3 subunits or NSP1–40S subunit complexes were added at 30 °C.
H,I). Example single-molecule fluorescence traces that depict association of NSP1–40S subunit complexes with a tethered CrPV+1
(panel H) or CrPV+48 (panel I) IRES molecules. The 40S subunit and NSP1 were labeled with Cy3 (green) and Cy5.5 (magenta) dyes,
respectively. Raw fluorescence intensities were corrected in this image to set baseline intensities to zero for presentation. These traces
depict the full duration of data acquisition. The 40S–CrPV IRES complex was more transient than that of the 40S–HCV IRES complex.
Thus, we often observed multiple NSP1–40S subunit complex association events within a single ZMW, particularly for CrPV+1, which
prevented analysis of NSP1 re-association with these model RNAs.
J). Plot of the fraction of 40S subunit binding events with NSP1 co-association on the indicated model RNAs at 30 ºC. Error bars
represent the 99% C.I..
K). Plot of association times and median lifetimes from the indicated experiments using CrPV+1 or CrPV+48 model RNAs at 30 ºC.
‘+NSP1’ indicates experiments where pre-formed NSP1–40S subunit complexes were added. The association time (40S Dt1) was
defined as the reciprocal of the fast association rate derived from fits to double-exponential functions, with error bars indicating the 95%
C.I. of the rate. Error bars for median lifetimes (40S 𝜏1, NSP1 𝜏1) represent 95% C.I.. Due to the relative instability of these IRES-40S
subunit complexes and the rapid re-association of 40S subunits, NSP1 re-association with single IRES–40S subunit complexes was not
examined. See Supplementary Table 5 for samples sizes and the parameters for relevant fits.
L-N). Cumulative probability plots of the indicated association times (panel L) or lifetimes (panels M, N) in experiments with CrPV+1 or
CrPV+48 model RNAs at 30 ºC. ‘+NSP1’ indicates experiments where pre-formed NSP1–40S subunit complexes were added. Lines
represent fits to double-exponential functions. See Supplementary Table 5 for samples sizes, parameters for relevant fits, and
medians with 95% C.I..
O,P). Cumulative probability plots of observed NSP1 re-association times (panel O) or lifetimes (panel P) with the indicated IRES–40S
subunit complexes at 30 ºC. As outlined in Fig. 4A, we focused on ZMWs where a single 40S subunit associated within the first 200 s
(≈ 75% of all events, see panel D). We then quantified the time elapsed from the loss of the first Cy5.5 signal to the next burst of Cy5.5
fluorescence at least ≈ 20 s in length (≈ 70% of initial NSP1 binding events, see panel F), which was defined as the NSP1 reassociation time (NSP1 Dt2). The duration of this second Cy5.5 event was defined as the re-associated NSP1 lifetime (NSP1 𝜏2). Lines
represent fits to double-exponential functions. See Supplementary Table 5 for samples sizes, parameters for relevant fits, and
medians with 95% C.I..
