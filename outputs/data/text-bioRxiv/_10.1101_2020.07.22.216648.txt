Abstract

25

Towards the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus (CoV) named severe acute respiratory

26

syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), genetically similar to severe acute respiratory

27

syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1), emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province of China,

28

and has been responsible of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans. Since

29

its first report, SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic, with over 10 million

30

human infections and over 560,000 deaths reported worldwide at the end of June 2020.

31

Currently, there are no United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-

32

approved vaccines and/or antivirals licensed against SARS-CoV-2, and the high

33

economical and health impact of SARS-CoV-2 has placed global pressure on the

34

scientific community to identify effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for the

35

treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 disease. While some

36

compounds have been already reported to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and a handful

37

of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been described that neutralize SARS-CoV-2,

38

there is an urgent need for the development and standardization of assays which can

39

be used in high through-put screening (HTS) settings to identify new antivirals and/or

40

neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we described a rapid, accurate and

41

highly reproducible plaque reduction microneutralization (PRMNT) assay that can be

42

quickly adapted for the identification and characterization of both neutralizing mAbs and

43

antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, our MNA is compatible with HTS settings to

44

interrogate large and/or complex libraries of mAbs and/or antivirals to identify those with

45

neutralizing and/or antiviral activity, respectively, against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

72

A new variant of coronavirus (CoV) emerged around December of 2019 causing

73

multiple hospitalizations in Wuhan, China (Bogoch et al., 2020; Choy et al., 2020). Ever

74

since its first emergence, this novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2

75

(SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for several cases of pneumonia leading to death

76

among hospitalized patients all around the world. The transboundary spread of this

77

coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease, designated as coronavirus disease

78

2019 (COVID-19), prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the

79

disease as a global pandemic on March 11th, 2020 (Organization). Besides the public

80

health significance, COVID-19 has also disrupted the functioning of the global supply

81

chain, bringing to a halt major economic activities all around the world.

82

SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1

83

(SARS-CoV-1) in the Coronaviridae family and has a single-stranded, non-segmented,

84

positive-sense RNA genome (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). Like other CoVs, SARS-

85

CoV-2 encodes four conserved structural membrane (M), envelope (E), nucleoprotein

86

(NP), and spike (S) proteins, all of which play an important role in viral replication

87

(Masters, 2006; Mortola and Roy, 2004; Schoeman and Fielding, 2019; Wang et al.,

88

2017). Of the four structural proteins, the S protein determines tissue tropism and host

89

susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. An early aspect of SARS-CoV-2 replication in a

90

susceptible host is the complex interaction between the viral S protein and the host cell

91

surface receptor, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This intricate

92

association enables viral fusion to the host cell membrane facilitating virus entry, an

4

93

important requisite for successful virus replication. Owing to their importance in

94

facilitating virus entry, the S protein has been a major target of neutralizing antibodies

95

(NAbs) that are currently being produced against SARS-CoV-2.

96

Due to the high impact of COVID-19 and the lack of commercially available vaccines

97

and/or NAbs, many United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved

98

or repurposed drugs are currently being suggested for the treatment of clinically-

99

infected COVID-19 patients (Elfiky, 2020; Park et al., 2020b; Xu et al., 2020). As

100

scientist and clinicians race to identify drugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection

101

and associated COVID-19 disease, some have been used in clinical settings with no

102

supporting evidence of antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Reihani et al., 2020). The

103

majority of these compounds are being recommended based on their ability to target

104

specific steps of the replication cycle of similar viruses or, as seen in some cases,

105

based on their ability to inhibit protozoan parasites (Yao et al., 2020). Apart from the

106

lack of effective antiviral or immunotherapeutic activity against SARS-CoV-2,

107

administration of certain antiviral compounds in COVID-19 patients has being a subject

108

of safety concern among many clinicians. For instance, at high doses, chloroquine is

109

extremely toxic causing death as a result of cardiac arrhythmias (Juurlink, 2020; Riou et

110

al., 1988), and in the current pandemic, cases of chloroquine poisoning have been

111

reported in Nigeria due to the abuse of the drug for treating COVID-19 patients (Chary

112

et al., 2020). As a result, there is an urgent need for assays that can be used to screen

113

the increasing lists of potential antiviral compounds and/or NAbs for an effective and

114

safe anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Herein, we described a rapid approach that can be

Biosafety Recommendations: Although SARS-CoV-2 has been temporarily classified

176

as a category B pathogen, biosafety caution applicable to the category A pathogens are

177

strongly recommended when handling this pathogen. Manipulation of SARS-CoV-2

178

should only be carried out in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility with an appropriate

179

engineering system designed to produce negative air pressure and enhance the safety

180

of laboratory workers. All individuals working with SARS-CoV-2 must have undergone

181

proper biosafety training to work at BSL3 laboratories and be cleared proficient to carry

182

out procedures requiring working with the virus. Cell culture procedures are carried out

183

in BSL2 and moved to BSL3 when ready for viral infection.

184
185

Cells: Vero E6 cells, which have been demonstrated to be permissive to SARS-CoV-2,

186

is the preferred cell type for the assays described in this protocol (Imai et al., 2020).

187

Other cells types such as Vero E6 transfected to express transmembrane protease,

188

serine 2 (TMPRSS2), a serine protease which activates SARS-CoV-2 infection

189

(Matsuyama et al., 2020), can also be used. An important consideration when choosing

190

a cell line for this assay is the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to efficiently infect and replicate in

191

the cell line. It is important to seed cells a day before the assay to achieve

192

approximately ~85-95% confluency. Vero E6 cells are maintained in DMEM

193

supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PSG. We recommend using a low passage of

194

Vero E6 cells as we have found that these cells grow better and are more viable at low

195

passage. It is equally important to make sure the cells are free from any contaminants

196

including mycoplasma.

197
198

Virus: For the experiments described in this manuscript we used the SARS-CoV-2

199

isolate USA-WA1/2020 available from BEI Resources. For the proposed experiments,

200

we recommend using ~100-200 plaque forming units (PFU)/well for a 96-well plate.

201

Higher concentrations of the virus may affect the sensitivity of the assay while using

202

lower viral concentrations may result in reduced number of plaques/well. Following the

203

experimental conditions described in this manuscript, you would expect to have ~100-

204

200 positive staining cells/well at 24 h p.i.

205
206

Serum samples: It is important to heat-inactivate serum or plasma samples from

207

COVID-19 patients or SARS-CoV-2-infected animals at 56°C for 1 h before performing

208

the PRMNT assay to destroy complement proteins or residual SARS-CoV-2 particles.

209

The experimental procedures to inactivate the virus should be confirmed and approved

210

by the institutional biosafety committee (IBC) of the institute. It has been reported that

211

complement deposition on virus envelope may lead to infection-enhancement which

212

may mask the neutralizing effects of Abs contained in serum or plasma samples

213

(Montefiori, 1997). For serum samples or plasma samples, we recommend starting with

214

a 1:100 dilution to avoid potential impurities that may affect the sensitivity of the assay.

215

In the case of mAbs, we recommend staring with 10 µg. However, this will depend on

216

the neutralizing capability of the mAb. We used a hmAb, 1207B4, for the purposes of

217

this study.

218
219

Drugs: The drug used in this study is remdesivir, a nucleoside analog which interferes

220

with the replication of viral genome by inhibiting viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase

221

(RdRp) (Gordon et al., 2020). Any other antiviral drug or compound with potential

222

antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 can equally be used in the assays described

223

below.

224
225

Controls: It is important to validate the described PRMNT assays by including proper

226

positive and negative controls. A mAb with a known neutralizing titer or serum and/or

227

plasma samples from convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients that contains known NAbs

10

228

can be used as positive controls. In the case of the antiviral drugs, we recommend to

229

use remdesivir since it has been shown to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2

230

(Choy et al., 2020; Ferner and Aronson, 2020). Negative controls include the use of

231

SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells without NAbs, sera, or drugs. An additional

232

recommended control to validate the immunostaining with the NP 1C7 mAb is to include

233

cells without viral infection.

234

General Procedure: All cell cultures procedures and antibody/antiviral dilutions are

235

generally performed in the BSL2 before transfer to the BSL3 facility on the day of virus

236

infection. For PRMNT assay, the amount of virus per well can be optimized based on

237

the virus titer in the stock. During the inactivation procedure, it is important to ensure

238

that the entire plate and its lid are fully submerged in 10% formalin solution for proper

239

inactivation. After the inactivation procedure plates can be transferred from BSL3 to the

240

BSL2 for immunostaining and development.

Preparation of SARS-CoV-2 stock

259

1. A day before viral infection, seed Vero E6 cells in a T-225 cell culture flask in

260

cell-maintenance media to attain ~85%-95% confluency on the day of infection

261

and place them in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.

262
263

2. Thaw the stock virus and prepare an infection media containing the virus
inoculum at a MOI of 0.001.

264

3. Remove cell maintenance media and replace with infection media containing the

265

virus in a total volume of 10 mL. Place the tissue culture flasks of infected cells in

266

Ziploc bags and transport them on a flat tray to the humidified incubator and

267

incubate at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2. Note: shake the flasks, gently,

268

every 10 minutes to prevent cells from drying out during a 1 h incubation time-

269

point (TP).

270
271
272

4. After 1 h of virus adsorption, in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2,
remove the virus inoculum and replace with ~40 mL of post-infection media.
5. Incubate for 72 h in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.

273

Note: SARS-CoV-2 behaves differently compared to most other viruses in that

274

the presence of cytopathic effect (CPE) does not correlate with increased virus

275

titer. For our virus stock, we carried out a multistep growth kinetics to determine

276

the best time with the highest virus yield. In our hands, this correlated nicely with

277

low CPE at ~72 h of incubation.

278
279
280

6. Freeze-thaw the flask containing the tissue culture supernatant (TCS) once,
followed by centrifugation at 2,000 g for 10 min at 4°C.
7. Aliquot the TCS in 500 µL volumes, and store at - 80°C until further use.

281
282

Determining the infectious virus titer by plaque assay

283

1. The day before infection, prepare Vero E6 cells (6-well plate format,1 x 106 cells

284

/well) in cell-maintenance media and place them in a humidified incubator at

285

37°C with 5% CO2.

286

2. Prepare 10-fold serial dilutions of the SARS-CoV-2 stock in infection media.

287

Briefly, pipette 450 μL of infection media and add 50 μL of the virus stock in the

288

first tube. Transfer 50 μL from tube #1 (10-1 dilution) to tube #2 (10-2 dilution) and

289

continue doing serial dilutions.

290

Note: It is important to change the tips between viral dilutions to prevent the

291

transfer of virus particles from a lower to higher diluted infection medium.

292

3. Infect the 6-well plates of Vero E6 cells with 200 μL of each of the SARS-CoV-2

293

dilutions and incubate for 1 h in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.

294

Place the plates of infected cells in a Ziploc bag and transport them on a flat tray

295

to the humidified incubator and incubate at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2.

4. To prevent cells from drying and to also facilitate virus adsorption, shake the
plates gently every 10 minutes.
5. After 1 h of viral absorption, remove the virus inoculum and overlay the cells with

299

DMEM/F-12/Agar mixture.

300

Note: ensure that at the start of the infection, the 2% agar is melted in a

301

microwave and the temperature brought down to approximately 42°C when

302

mixing with warm DMEM/F-12/Agar mixture.

Note: It is important to keep the agar cool enough not to burn the cells, and at the

304

same time warm enough not to solidify in the process of pipetting.

6. Allow the agar to solidify and invert the plates to prevent the accumulation of
moisture during incubation.
7. Incubate the cells for 72 h in a humidified incubator at 37°C in the presence of
5% CO2.
8. At 72 h post-infection (h p.i.), fix infected cells in 10% formalin solution for 24 h.

310

Note: After 24 h fixation with 10% formalin solution, plates can be moved from

311

the BSL3 to the BSL2 to complete the viral titration.

9. Perform immunostaining using the cross-reactive SARS-CoV-1 NP mAb 1C7, at

313

a working concentration of 1 μg/mL.

A plaque reduction microneutralization (PRMNT) assay to identify Abs with

319

neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2

320

This assay can be used to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity by mAbs,

321

polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) or by an Ab-containing sample such as serum plasma from

322

mammalian host species. Since serial dilutions of the Ab containing samples are used,

323

the PRMNT assay measures the neutralizing activity of Abs in a concentration

324

dependent manner. The ability of a NAbs to inhibit virus infection is manifested in the

325

reduced capacity of the virus to produce visible plaques when compared to virus-only

326

infected control cells. The PRMNT assay is similar to a plaque reduction neutralization

327

(PRNT) assay with the only difference that the PRMNT utilizes 96-well plates. Although

328

in this manuscript we describe the use of PRMNT in 96-well plates, similar experimental

329

approaches can be miniaturized and conducted in 384-well cell culture plates for HTS

330

purposes.

331
332

A PRMNT assay to identify NAbs

333

The process of entry into a susceptible host cell is an important determinant of infectivity

334

and pathogenesis of viruses, including CoVs (Li, 2016; Perlman and Netland, 2009).

335

SARS-CoV-2 relies on the ability of its S glycoprotein to bind to the ACE2 receptor

336

through its receptor-binding domain (RBD) driving a conformational change that

337

culminates in the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane, and cell entry

338

(Shang et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 S is made up of 2 subunits, S1 and S2. During pre-

339

treatment, mAbs, or Ab containing samples, are pre-incubated with SARS-CoV-2 at

340

37°C for 1h. This enables the Abs to bind to the S protein blocking virus attachment,

15

341

and subsequently interfering with the process of virus entry. While some SARS-CoV-2-

342

induced NAbs can preferentially bind to either the S1 or S2 subunit of the S protein,

343

others can bind, with a high affinity, to the RBD located within the S1 subunit (Wang et

344

al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). After 1 h of incubation, the Ab-virus mixture is then

345

transferred to a confluent (~85-95%) monolayer of Vero E6 cells and incubated for 24 h

346

at 37°C. During this period, the unbound virus particles are able to attach to cells and

347

initiate virus replication which can be determined by staining for SARS-CoV-2. In the

348

post-treatment condition, virus adsorption is allowed to progress for 1h at 37°C. This

349

gives an opportunity for the virus to initiate viral entry by binding to the cell surface

350

receptor. NAb incubated with the infected cells may interfere with active viral replication

351

partly by blocking later steps of the virus entry into the cell or by inhibiting the cell-to-cell

352

spread of virus progeny. In both pre- and post-treatment conditions, the extent of virus

353

neutralization can be visualized upon staining with a cross-reactive anti-SARS-CoV-1

354

NP mAb (1C7), and the neutralization titer 50 (NT50) is calculated using a sigmoidal

355

dose-response curve. The NT50 of an Ab is the dilution which inhibited viral replication in

356

50% of the infected cells. While the pre-treatment PRMNT assay can be described, to

357

some extent, as a prophylactic assessment of a NAb, the post-treatment PRMNT assay

358

offers a therapeutic evaluation of the neutralizing activity of Abs against SARS-CoV-2.

359

In addition, while the pre-treatment PRMNT assay focuses on identifying NAbs targeting

360

the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD, the post-treatment PRMNT assay also allow the identification

361

of Abs targeting other regions on the viral S glycoprotein involved in the fusion event

362

(e.g. S2), or Abs affecting other steps in the replication cycle of the virus (e.g. virus

363

assembly and/or budding). In general, a potent SARS-CoV-2 NAb will show a low NT50

364

titer whereas a weak NAb will give a high NT50 value. This protocol precludes the

365

necessity for a cytotoxicity assay since Abs are not known to produce cytotoxic effects

366

in cell cultures. However, a potential toxic effect of the NAbs can be determined when

367

developing the assay with the infrared staining described below.

Pre-treatment PRMNT assay
1. Seed ~1 x 104 Vero E6 cells/well the day before virus infection in 96-well plates
using cell maintenance media.
2. On the day of infection, check the confluency of the Vero E6 cells under a light
microscope. The optimal cell confluency should be ~85-95%.

374

3. Prepare a 2-fold serial dilution of the Ab (or Ab containing sample) in an empty,

377

Ab, or Ab containing sample, to column 1. Transfer 50 μL of Ab from column 1 to

378

column 2, and mix ~10 times using a multi-channel pipette. Repeat this process

379

from column 2 to column 10, changing the tips between dilutions to prevent

380

transfer of residual Ab. Discard 50 μL from the solution in column 10 after dilution

381

so that each well of the 96-well plate has 50 μL of diluted Ab. Columns 11 and 12

are included as internal controls, as virus-only and mock-only, respectively. Each

383

Ab is tested in triplicate.

the diluted Ab or media-only and no-virus control wells (columns 11 and 12,

423

PRMNT assay to identify compounds with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2

424

Several antiviral compounds are currently being evaluated for their effectiveness

425

against SARS-CoV-2 (Buonaguro et al., 2020; Elfiky, 2020; Park et al., 2020b; Xu et al.,

426

2020). Different antiviral compounds target different steps of the viral replication cycle

427

which provides the basis for the use of a PRMNT assay for antiviral screening.

428

Hydroxychloroquine, a potential antiviral compound has been suggested to inhibit

429

SARS-CoV-2 by blocking fusion to the cell membrane, (Fox, 1993; Yao et al., 2020).

430

Other compounds in clinical trials, such as remdesivir, target the viral RdRp which is

431

involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication (Buonaguro et al., 2020). This protocol can be

19

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.22.216648; this version posted July 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

432

adopted to screen the inhibitory effect and concentration of anti-SARS-CoV-2

433

compounds irrespective of the viral replication step. Although this protocol describes the

434

antiviral activity in post-infection conditions, an alternative assay where the antiviral drug

435

is provided before viral infection will help to provide information on the pre-entry

436

mechanism of antiviral activity of the compound. The antiviral activity is determined by

437

assessing the effective concentration that inhibits virus replication in Vero E6 cells (96-

438

well plates, ~4 x 104 Vero E6 cells/well at confluency, triplicates) following viral

439

incubation for 24 h. Note that the seeding density of Vero E6 in 96-well is ~1 x 104

440

cells/well while cells at confluency is ~4 x 104 cells/well. It is important to include as a

441

positive control in this antiviral PRMNT assay a drug with a known antiviral activity

442

against SARS-CoV-2, such as remdesivir (Elfiky, 2020). Unlike NAbs, some compounds

443

could have cytotoxic effects. As a result, it becomes imperative to carry-out a

444

cytotoxicity test (e.g. MTT assay) to evaluate for potential cytotoxicity of a given

445

compound. Vero E6 cells for an MTT assay can be seeded on the same day as the cells

446

for PRMNT assay so that the experiments can be conducted in parallel. Alternatively,

447

our infrared staining technique can be used, concurrently, to evaluate cell viability in the

448

same cells, in 96-well plates, used for PRMNT assay.

3. On the day of infection, check the confluency of the Vero E6 cells under a light

456

4. Prepare a 2-fold serial dilution of the antiviral in an empty, sterile 96-well cell

457

culture plates using post-infection media. Briefly, add 50 μL of infection media to

458

columns 2 to 12, and add 100 μL of 2X of the desired starting concentration of

459

each antiviral to column 1. The starting concentration of the antiviral will,

460

generally, depend on the type of drug being evaluated. We normally use a

461

starting concentration of 50 µM for antivirals. Transfer 50 μL of antiviral from

462

column 1 to column 2, and mix ~ 10 times using a multi-channel pipette. Repeat

463

this process from column 2 to column 10, changing the tips between dilutions to

464

prevent transfer of residual antiviral. Discard 50 μL from the solution in column 10

465

after dilution so that each well of the 96-well plate has 50 μL of either diluted

466

antiviral or no antiviral (for columns 11 and 12). Columns 11 and 12 are included

467

as virus-only and mock-only control wells, respectively.

472

one 96-well plate) of infection media.

473

7. Remove media from the cell cultured Vero E6 cells in the 96-well plate and add

the CO2 incubator to allow viral adsorption.

Development of the PRMNT assays

485

For development of the PRMNT assays described above, we have optimized two

486

different protocols with comparatively similar results: the peroxidase and the infrared

487

staining techniques. The infrared staining technique holds the advantage of its capability

488

to measure cell viability in addition to measuring antiviral activity. In the case of the

489

peroxidase staining, a separate assay is needed to assess cell toxicity of NAbs or

490

antiviral compounds. Both assays rely on the use of the SARS-CoV-1 cross-reactive NP

491

mAb, 1C7 (Amanat et al., 2020) but any other mAb targeting a SARS-CoV-2 viral

492

antigen can be used in the peroxidase and the infrared staining described below.

493
494

Peroxidase staining

495

1. Once the plates are in the BSL2 after inactivation, remove residual formalin

496

solution by gentle wash with double distilled water (DDW) before staining. Be

497

careful not to touch or dislodge the cells in the 96-well plate with pipette tips.

498

2. Gently wash the cells three times with 100 μL/well of PBS.

499

3. Permeabilize the cells with 100 μL/well of 0.5% Triton X-100 dissolved in PBS,

500

and incubate at room temperature (RT) for 15 min in the biosafety cabinet.

508

4. Wash the cells with 100 μL/well of PBS, three times, and block with 100 μL/well
of 2.5% BSA in PBS. Incubate cells at 37°C for 1 h.
5. Prepare primary Ab solution (anti-NP mAb, 1C7, 1 μg/mL) in 1% BSA, in PBS.
Add 50 μL/well of primary Ab solution and incubate at 37°C for 1 h.
6. After incubation with the primary Ab, wash each well three times with 100 μL/well
of PBS.

509

7. Prepare the biotinylated anti-mouse Ab (VECTASTAIN® ABC-HRP Kit,

510

Peroxidase (Mouse IgG); Vector Laboratory) following the manufacturer’s

511

instructions. For one 96-well plate, add 75 μL of normal blocking serum stock and

512

25 μL of biotinylated secondary Ab stock to 5 mL of PBS. Add 50 μL/well of

513

biotinylated Ab solution to each well, and incubate for 30 min at 37°C.

514

8. Next, wash each well three times with 100 μL/well of PBS to remove biotinylated

515

Ab solution thoroughly. Prepare VECTASTAIN ABC Reagent by following

516

manufacturer’s instructions (VECTASTAIN® ABC-HRP Kit, Peroxidase (Mouse

517

IgG); Vector Laboratory). For one 96-well plate, add 50 μL each of Reagent A

518

(Avidin, ABC) and Reagent B (Biotinylated HRP, ABC) to 5 mL of PBS. Then,

519

add 50 μL/well of VECTASTAIN ABC Reagent and incubate for 30 min at 37°C.

10. Add 50 μL of developing solution to each well and wait until visible plaques are
observed.

526

11. Stop the reaction by removing the developing solution, and wash with PBS. It is

527

important not to wait for too long once the plaques are discernible to prevent the

528

entire cells from turning black.

given as [(Average # of plaques from each treated wells – average # of plaques

533

from “no virus” wells)/(average # of plaques from “virus only” wells - average # of

534

plaques from “no virus” wells)] x 100. A non-linear regression curve fit analysis

535

over the dilution curve can be performed using GraphPad Prism to calculate NT50

Discussion

579

As COVID-19 cases continue to increase across the globe, there is an urgent need to

580

identify effective and safe prophylactics and/or therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-

581

CoV-2 in infected patients. In this study, we described robust assays and staining

582

techniques which can be employed to evaluate the neutralizing and/or antiviral activity

583

of Abs and/or antivirals, respectively, against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.

584

The PRMNT assay described here measures the neutralization effect of Abs or the

585

antiviral activity of compounds against SARS-CoV-2 in similar manner to what we have

586

previously described with other viruses, including, among others, influenza (Baker et al.,

587

2015; Bauman et al., 2013; Martinez-Sobrido et al., 2010; Nogales et al., 2019; Nogales,

588

Baker, and Martinez-Sobrido, 2015; Nogales et al., 2018; Nogales et al., 2016; Park et

589

al., 2020a; Piepenbrink et al., 2019; Rodriguez, Nogales, and Martinez-Sobrido, 2017;

Yang et al., 2016), mammarenaviruses (Brouillette et al., 2018; Ortiz-Riano et al., 2014;

591

Robinson et al., 2016; Rodrigo, de la Torre, and Martinez-Sobrido, 2011), and Zika virus

592

(Park et al., 2019). Although the assay described here was adapted to 96-well plate

593

format, it can be adjusted to 384-well plate format for HTS of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals

594

and/or NAbs. Many factors, including virus isolate, virus titer, cell condition or

595

confluency, nature of samples, and incubation period can affect the outcome of this

596

assay (Amanat et al., 2020). It is important to optimize these conditions so as to be able

597

to generate accurate and reproducible data between different laboratories.

598

To restrict virus spread in infected cells, it is paramount to incubate the infected cells

599

with post-infection media containing 1% Avicel. Incubation without Avicel will enhance a

600

rapid cell-to-cell spread of virus resulting in higher NT50 or EC50. Although this assay

601

works best in our hands using 1% Avicel, other reagents, such as 0.75%

602

carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) can also be used (Oladunni et al., 2019).

603

Both the peroxidase and the infrared staining described here measures the level of

604

SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the staining SARS-CoV-2 NP. However, the staining

605

techniques can also be adapted for Abs that recognizes other SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

606

While both staining techniques are comparable with regards to NT50 and EC50 values,

607

the infrared staining offers the advantage of measuring virus replication and cell viability

608

in a single assay, saving time and reagents needed to separately evaluate cytotoxicity.
