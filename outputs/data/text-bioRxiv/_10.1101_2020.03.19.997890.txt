Abstract (153)

28

Coronaviruses (CoVs) traffic frequently between species resulting in novel disease

outbreaks, most recently exemplified by the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we

30

show that the ribonucleoside analog β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC, EIDD-1931) has

31

broad spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV 2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and

related zoonotic group 2b or 2c Bat-CoVs, as well as increased potency against a

coronavirus bearing resistance mutations to another nucleoside analog inhibitor. In

34

mice infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, both prophylactic and therapeutic

35

administration of EIDD-2801, an orally bioavailable NHC-prodrug (b-D-N4-

36

hydroxycytidine-5’-isopropyl ester), improved pulmonary function, and reduced virus

37

titer and body weight loss. Decreased MERS-CoV yields in vitro and in vivo were

38

associated with increased transition mutation frequency in viral but not host cell RNA,

39

supporting a mechanism of lethal mutagenesis. The potency of NHC/EIDD-2801 against

40

multiple coronaviruses, its therapeutic efficacy, and oral bioavailability in vivo, all

41

highlight its potential utility as an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and other

42

future zoonotic coronaviruses.

Introduction
The genetically diverse Orthocoronavirinae (coronavirus, CoV) family circulates

46

in many avian and mammalian species. Phylogenetically, CoVs are divided into 4

47

genera: alpha (group 1), beta (group 2), gamma (group 3) and delta (group 4). Three

48

new human CoV have emerged in the past 20 years with severe acute respiratory

49

syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-

50

CoV) in 2012, and now SARS-CoV-2 in 20191-3. The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic

51

(referred to as COVID-19, Coronavirus disease 2019) has caused over 89,000

52

infections and over 3,000 deaths in 71 countries. Like SARS- and MERS-CoV, the

53

respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 can progress to acute lung injury (ALI), an

54

end stage lung disease with limited treatment options and very poor prognoses3-5. This

55

emergence paradigm is not limited to humans. A novel group 1 CoV called swine acute

56

diarrhea syndrome CoV (SADS-CoV) recently emerged from bats causing the loss of

57

over 20,000 pigs in Guangdong Province, China6. More alarmingly, many group 2

58

SARS-like and MERS-like coronaviruses are circulating in bat reservoir species that can

59

use human receptors and replicate efficiently in primary human lung cells without

60

adaptation6-9. The presence of these “pre-epidemic” zoonotic strains foreshadow the

61

emergence and epidemic potential of additional SARS-like and MERS-like viruses in the

62

future. Given the diversity of CoV strains in zoonotic reservoirs and a penchant for

63

emergence, broadly active antivirals are clearly needed for rapid response to new CoV

64

outbreaks in humans and domesticated animals.

65

Currently, there are no approved therapies specific for any human CoV. β-D-N4-

66

hydroxycytidine (NHC, EIDD-1931) is orally bioavailable ribonucleoside analog with

67

broad-spectrum antiviral activity against various unrelated RNA viruses including

68

influenza, Ebola, CoV and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV)10-13. For VEEV,

69

the mechanism of action (MOA) for NHC has been shown to be through lethal

70

mutagenesis where deleterious transition mutations accumulate in viral RNA11,14. Here,

71

we demonstrate that NHC exerts potent, broad-spectrum activity against SARS-CoV,

72

MERS-CoV and their related bat-CoV in primary human airway epithelial cell cultures

73

(HAE), a biologically relevant model of the human conducting airway. In addition, we

74

show that NHC is potently antiviral against the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 as well as

75

against coronavirus bearing resistance mutations to the potent nucleoside analog

76

inhibitor, remdesivir (RDV). In SARS- or MERS-CoV infected mice, both prophylactic

77

and therapeutic administration EIDD-2801, an oral NHC-prodrug (b-D-N4-

78

hydroxycytidine-5’-isopropyl ester) improved pulmonary function and reduced virus titer

79

and ameliorated disease severity. In addition, therapeutic EIDD-2801 reduced the

80

pathological features of ALI in SARS-CoV infected mice. Using a high-fidelity deep

81

sequencing approach (Primer ID), we found that increased mutation rates coincide with

82

decreased MERS-CoV yields in vitro and protective efficacy in vivo supporting the MOA

83

of lethal mutagenesis against emerging CoV13. The broad activity and therapeutic

84

efficacy of NHC/EIDD-2801 highlight its potential to diminish epidemic disease today

85

and limit future emerging CoV outbreaks.

Replication.

90

To determine whether NHC blocks the replication of highly pathogenic human

91

CoV, we performed antiviral assays in continuous and primary human lung cell cultures.

92

We first assessed the antiviral activity of NHC against MERS-CoV in the human lung

93

epithelial cell line Calu-3 2B4 (“Calu3” cells). Using a recombinant MERS-CoV

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.997890; this version posted March 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

94

expressing nanoluciferase (MERS-nLUC)15, we measured virus replication in cultures

95

exposed to a dose range of drug for 48hr. NHC was potently antiviral with an average

96

half-maximum effective concentration (IC50) of 0.15µM and no observed cytoxicity in

97

similarly treated uninfected cultures across the dose range (50% cytotoxic

98

concentration, CC50, >10µM) (Fig. 1A). The therapeutic index for NHC was >100.

99

Similarly, NHC strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells with an IC50 of

100

0.3µM and CC50 of >10µM (Fig. 1B). Human primary airway epithelial (HAE) cell

101

cultures model the architecture and cellular complexity of the conducting airway and are

102

readily infected by multiple human and zoonotic CoV, including SARS- and MERS-

103

CoV16. We first assessed cytotoxicity of NHC in HAE treated with an extended dose

104

range for 48hr using quantitative PCR of cell death-related gene transcripts as our

105

metric. NHC treatment did not appreciably alter gene expression even at doses up to

106

100µM (Supplementary Figure 1). In MERS-CoV infected HAE, NHC dramatically

107

reduced virus production with maximal titer reduction of > 5 logs at 10µM (average IC50

108

= 0.024 µM), which correlated with reduced genomic (ORF1) and subgenomic (ORFN)

109

RNA in paired samples (Fig. 1C). We observed similar trends in titer reduction (> 3 log

110

at 10µM, average IC50 = 0.14 µM) and levels of genomic and subgenomic RNA in

111

SARS-CoV infected HAE (Fig. 1D). Thus, NHC was potently antiviral against MERS-

112

CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in cell lines and MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in human primary

113

HAE cell cultures without cytotoxicity.

114
115

NHC is effective against remdesivir resistant virus and multiple distinct zoonotic

116

CoV.

117

All human CoV are thought to have emerged as zoonoses most recently

118

exemplified by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-217-19. Although taxonomically

119

divided into multiple genogroups (alpha , beta , gamma , delta), human CoV are found

120

in only the alpha and beta subgroups thus far (Fig. 2A). There is high sequence

121

conservation in the RdRp across CoV (Fig. 2A). For example, the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2

122

has 99.1% similarity and 96% amino acid identity to that of SARS-CoV (Fig. 2A). To

123

gain insight into structural conservation of RdRp across the CoV family, we modeled the

124

variation reflected in the RdRp dendrogram in Fig. 2A onto the structure of the SARS-

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.997890; this version posted March 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

125

CoV RdRp20 (Fig. 2B). The core of the RdRp molecule and main structural motifs that all

126

RdRp harbor (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Figure 2) are highly conserved among CoV

127

including SARS-CoV-2. We previously reported that CoV resistance to another broad

128

spectrum nucleoside analog, remdesivir (RDV) was mediated by RdRp residues F480L

129

and V557L in a model coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and in SARS-CoV,

130

resulting in a 5-fold shift in IC50 (Fig. 2C)21. Consequently, we tested whether RDV

131

resistance mutations in MHV conferred cross resistance to NHC (Figure 2D). In fact,

132

the two RDV resistance mutations, alone or together conferred increased sensitivity to

133

inhibition by NHC. As our previous studies have demonstrated a high genetic barrier to

134

NHC for VEEV, influenza and coronavirus11-13, the lack of cross resistance further

135

suggests that NHC and RDV may select for exclusive and mutually sensitizing

136

resistance pathways.

137

To explore the breadth of antiviral efficacy against zoonotic CoV, we performed

138

antiviral assays in HAE with three zoonotic Bat-CoV, SHC014, HKU3 and HKU5.

139

Closely related to the beta 2b SARS-CoV, Bat-CoV SHC014 is capable of replicating in

140

human cells without adaptation8 suggesting its potential for zoonotic emergence. More

141

distantly related SARS-like beta 2b CoV, recombinant Bat-CoV HKU3 has a modified

142

receptor binding domain to facilitate growth in cell culture22. Lastly, Bat-CoV HKU5 is a

143

MERS-like beta 2c CoV23. NHC diminished infectious virus production and the levels of

144

genomic/subgenomic viral RNA in HAE in a dose-dependent manner for all three Bat-

145

CoVs (Fig. 3). Therefore, the antiviral activity of NHC was not limited by natural amino

146

acid variation in the RdRp, which among the group 2b and group 2c CoV can vary by

147

almost 20% (Fig. 2A). Moreover, these data suggest that if another SARS- or MERS-

148

like virus were to spillover into humans in the future, they would likely be susceptible to

149

the antiviral activity of NHC.

150
151

NHC antiviral activity is associated with increased viral mutation rates.

152

It has recently been shown that NHC treatment increases the mutation rate in

153

viral genomic RNA of RSV24, VEEV11, influenza24, and our previous study used RNA

154

seq to show that overall transition mutation frequency is increased during NHC

155

treatment of MHV and MERS-CoV during infection in continuous cell lines13. We sought

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.997890; this version posted March 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

156

to determine if NHC would increase the mutation frequency during MERS-CoV infection

157

in human primary human airway epithelial cells (HAE). Using MERS-CoV infected HAE

158

treated with either vehicle or a dose range of NHC or RDV, we show that both drugs

159

reduced virus titers in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). We then employed a highly-

160

sensitive high-fidelity deep sequencing approach (Primer ID NGS), which uses

161

barcoded degenerate primers and Illumina indexed libraries to determine accurate

162

mutation rates after antiviral treatment on viral RNA production25. Using this approach,

163

we analyzed a 538bp region of viral genomic RNA in nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15).

164

The error rates (#mutations/10,000 bases) in vehicle (0.01) or RDV (0.01) treated

165

cultures were very low. RDV is reported to act via chain termination of nascent viral

166

RNA, and thus the low error rates in RDV-treated cultures are in line with the proposed

167

MOA26. In contrast, the error rate was significantly increased in NHC-treated MERS-

168

CoV RNA in a dose-dependent manner (10-fold at 10µM and 5-fold at 1µM) at both 24

169

and 48hpi (Fig. 4C). The magnitude of the error rate in NHC-treated cultures correlated

170

with virus titer reduction. At 48hpi the respective error rate and virus titer was 0.015 and

171

3.96E+06 pfu/mL for vehicle treatment, 0.045 and 2.86E+04 pfu/mL with 1µM NHC; and

172

0.090 and 1.5E+02 pfu/mL 10µM NHC. Thus, with 1µM NHC a 3-fold increase in error

173

rate resulted in a 138-fold decrease in virus titer, while with 10µM NHC a 6-fold increase

174

in error rate resulted in a 26,000-fold decrease in virus titer.

175

We then examined the mutational spectra induced by NHC, which can be

176

incorporated into viral RNA as a substitution for either cytosine (C) or Uridine (U). RNA-

177

mutagenic antivirals may incorporate in both nascent negative and positive sense RNA

178

during genome replication (Fig. 4D). Adenine-to-guanine (A-to-G) and uracil-to-cytosine

179

(U-to-C) transitions were enriched in MERS-CoV genomic RNA in an NHC dose-

180

dependent manner (Fig. 4E). Collectively, these data used high-fidelity sequence

181

analysis to demonstrate a specific enrichment for A:G and C:U transitions in MERS-

182

CoV RNA after NHC treatment of primary HAE cell cultures.

Therapeutic EIDD-2801 reduces SARS-CoV replication and pathogenesis.
Given the promising antiviral activity of NHC in vitro, we next evaluated its in vivo
efficacy using EIDD-2801, an orally bioavailable prodrug of NHC (b-D-N4-

187

hydroxycytidine-5’-isopropyl ester), designed for improved in vivo pharmacokinetics and

188

oral bioavailability in humans and non-human primates12. Importantly, the plasma

189

profiles of NHC and EIDD-2801 were similar in mice following oral delivery12. We first

190

performed a prophylactic dose escalation study in C57BL/6 mice where we orally

191

administered vehicle (10% PEG, 2.5% Cremophor RH40 in water) or 50, 150 or 500

192

mg/kg EIDD-2801 2hr prior to intranasal infection with 5E+04 PFU of mouse-adapted

193

SARS-CoV (SARS-MA15), and then every 12hr thereafter. Beginning on 3dpi and

194

through the end of the study, body weight loss compared to vehicle treatment was

195

significantly diminished (50mg/kg) or prevented (150, 500mg/kg) with EIDD-2801

196

prophylaxis (P < 0.0001) (Supplemental Figure 2A). Lung hemorrhage was also

197

significantly reduced 5dpi with 500mg/kg EIDD-2801 treatment (Supplemental Figure

198

2B). Interestingly, there was a dose-dependent reduction in SARS-CoV lung titer

199

(median titers: 50mg/kg = 7E+03 pfu/mL, 150mg/kg = 2.5E+03 pfu/mL, 500mg/kg = 50

200

pfu/mL, vehicle = 6.5E+04 pfu/mL) with significant differences among the vehicle, 150

201

mg/kg (P = 0.03) and 500mg/kg (P = 0.006) groups. Thus, prophylactic orally

202

administered EIDD-2801 was robustly antiviral and able to prevent SARS-CoV

203

replication and disease.

204

Since only the 500mg/kg group significantly diminished weight loss, hemorrhage

205

and reduced lung titer to near undetectable levels, we tested this dose under

206

therapeutic treatment conditions to determine if EIDD-2801 could improve the outcomes

207

of an ongoing CoV infection. As a control, we initiated oral vehicle or EIDD-2801 2hr

208

prior to infection with 1E+04 pfu SARS-MA15. For therapeutic conditions, we initiated

209

EIDD-2801 treatment 12, 24, or 48hr after infection. After initiating treatment, dosing for

210

all groups was performed every 12hr for the duration of the study. Both prophylactic

211

treatment initiated 2hr prior to infection and therapeutic treatment initiated 12hr after

212

infection significantly prevented body weight loss following SARS-CoV infection on 2dpi

213

and thereafter (-2hr: P = 0.0002 to <0.0001; +12hr: P = 0.0289 to <0.0001) (Fig. 5A).

214

Treatment initiated 24hpi also significantly reduced body weight loss (3-5dpi, P = 0.01 to

215

<0.0001) although not to the same degree as the earlier treatment initiation groups.

216

When initiated 48hpi, body weight loss was only different from vehicle on 4dpi (P =

217

0.037, Fig. 5A). Therapeutic EIDD-2801 significantly reduced lung hemorrhage when

218

initiated up to 24hr after infection mirroring the body weight loss phenotypes (Fig. 5B).

219

Interestingly, all EIDD-2801 treated mice had significantly reduced viral loads in the

220

lungs even in the +48hr group (Fig. 5C), which experienced the least protection from

221

body weight loss and lung hemorrhage. We also measured pulmonary function via

222

whole body plethysmography (WPB). In Figure 5D, we show the WBP PenH metric,

223

which is a surrogate marker for bronchoconstriction or pulmonary obstruction27, was

224

significantly improved throughout the course of the study if treatment was initiated up to

225

12hr after infection, although the +24hr group showed sporadic improvement as well

226

(Fig. 5D). Lastly, we blindly evaluated hematoxylin and eosin stained lung tissue

227

sections for histological features of ALI using two different and complementary scoring

228

tools15, which show that treatment initiated up to +12hr significantly reduced ALI (Fig.

229

5E). Altogether, therapeutic EIDD-2801 was potently antiviral against SARS-CoV in vivo

230

but the degree of clinical benefit was dependent on the time of initiation post infection.

231
232

Prophylactic and therapeutic EIDD-2801 reduces MERS-CoV replication and

233

pathogenesis.

234

After obtaining promising in vivo efficacy data with SARS-CoV, we investigated

235

whether EIDD-2801 would be effective against MERS-CoV. As the murine ortholog of

236

the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), does not support viral binding

237

and entry, all in vivo studies were performed in genetically modified mice encoding a

238

murine DPP4 receptor encoding two human residues at positions 288 and 330 (hDPP4

239

288/330 mice)15,28. Similar to our SARS-CoV data (Supplementary Figure 3), all doses

240

of prophylactic EIDD-2801 (50, 150 and 500mg/kg) protected hDPP4 288/330 mice

241

from significant body weight loss (P = 0.03 to < 0.0001), lung hemorrhage (P = 0.01 to

242

<0.0001), and virus replication which was undetectable (P < 0.0001) regardless of drug

243

dose following intranasal infection with 5E+04 PFU mouse-adapted MERS-CoV

244

(Supplementary Figure 4).

245

We then evaluated the therapeutic efficacy EIDD-2801 following the promising

246

results of our prophylactic studies. Similar to our SARS-CoV study, EIDD-2801

247

treatment administered before or 12hr after intranasal mouse-adapted MERS-CoV

248

infection (5E+04 PFU) prevented body weight loss from 2 through 6dpi (Fig. 6A, P =

249

0.02 to <0.0001) and lung hemorrhage on 6dpi (Fig. 6B, P = 0.0004 to < 0.0001), but

250

treatment initiated 24 or 48hr did not offer similar protection. Unlike body weight loss

251

and lung hemorrhage data which varied by treatment initiation time, virus lung titer on

252

6dpi was significantly reduced to the limit of detection in all treatment groups (Fig. 6C, P

253

< 0.0001). Interestingly, when viral genomic RNA was quantified in paired samples of

254

lung tissue, EIDD-2801 significantly reduced levels of viral RNA (P <0.0001 to 0.017) in

255

an initiation time-dependent manner for all groups except for +48hr (Fig. 6D). The

256

discrepancy among infectious titers and viral RNA suggests that accumulated mutations

257

render the particles non-infectious and undetectable by plaque assay consistent with

258

the MOA. To gauge the effect of EIDD-2801 treatment on lung function, we assessed

259

pulmonary function by WBP. Mirroring the body weight loss data, normal pulmonary

260

function was only observed in groups where treatment was initiated prior to or 12hr after

261

infection (Fig. 6E). Collectively, these data demonstrate that NHC prodrug, EIDD-2801,

262

robustly reduces MERS-CoV infectious titers, viral RNA, and pathogenesis under both

263

prophylactic and therapeutic conditions.

265

Therapeutic efficacy correlates with an increased MERS-CoV mutation rate in

266

vivo, without increased mutations in cellular RNA.

267

To study the molecular mechanisms associated with drug performance in vivo,

268

we investigated the correlation between infectious virus production and EIDD-2801-

269

mediated mutagenesis of MERS-CoV RNA under therapeutic treatment conditions.

270

Using Primer ID NGS, we measured the mutation rates of both viral genomic RNA (i.e.

271

non-structural protein 10, nsp10) and host interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15)

272

mRNA, a highly upregulated innate immune related gene after MERS-CoV infection

273

(Fig. 6F). Primer ID NGS measures the mutational frequency in single RNA molecules

274

each of which are represented by a single template consensus sequence (TCS, See

275

Fig. 4B)25. Viral TCS were significantly reduced in a treatment initiation time-dependent

276

manner (Fig. 6G) similar to viral genomic RNA measured by qRT-PCR (Fig. 6D). In

277

contrast, the numbers of ISG15 TCS were similar (P = 0.2 to 0.8) for all groups

278

indicating that neither vehicle nor drug treatment significantly affected the levels of or

279

mutated ISG15 mRNA transcripts (Fig. 6G). Similar to our TCS data in Figure 6G, the

280

total error rate in viral nsp10 was significantly increased in groups where treatment was

281

initiated prior to (-2hr, median error rate = 10.5 errors/10,000 bases, P < 0.0001) and up

282

to 24hr post infection (12hr, median error rate = 8.2 errors/10,000 bases, P < 0.0001 ;

283

+24hr, median error rate = 5.4 errors/10,000 bases, P = 0.0003) but the error rates in

284

ISG15 remained at baseline for all groups (Fig. 6H). In addition, nucleotide transitions

285

observed in MERS-CoV genomes in vitro (i.e. C to U transitions, Fig. 3), were also

286

observed in vivo in groups where treatment was initiated prior to and up to 12hr post

287

infection (P = 0.0003 to < 0.0001) (Fig. 5I). Importantly, these transitions were not

288

observed in host ISG15 mRNA (Fig. 5I). Lastly, the EIDD-2801 dose-dependent

289

mutagenesis of viral RNA correlated with an increase in codon change frequency,

290

including stop codons, in mice where treatment was initiated 12hr or before (vehicle

291

median = 3.4; -2hr median = 22.8, P = 0.0035; +12hr median = 20.0, P = 0.0004, Fig.

292

5I). Thus, approximately 20% of the mutations observed in the -2hr and +12hr groups

293

resulted in a codon change and alteration of the nsp10 protein sequence. When

294

extrapolating our results from nsp10 to the entirety of the 30kb MERS-CoV genome,

295

EIDD-2801 likely causes between 15 (+24hr treatment) and 30 (-2hr treatment)

296

mutations per genome 10-20% of which result in amino acid coding changes.

297

Altogether, our data demonstrates that EIDD-2801-driven mutagenesis correlates well

298

with the reductions in viral load, strongly suggestive of an error catastrophe-driven

299

mechanism of action under therapeutic conditions.

Discussion

302

In the past 20 years, three novel human coronaviruses have emerged29,30. The

303

group 2b SARS-like CoV represent an existential and future threat to global health as

304

evidenced by the emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 and zoonotic SARS-like

305

bat CoV strains that can use human ACE2 receptors, grow well in primary human

306

airway cells and vary by as much as 25% in key therapeutic and vaccine gene

307

targets8,31. Thus, to address the current public health emergency of COVID-19 and to

308

maximize pandemic preparedness in the future, broad-based vaccines and

309

therapeutics, which are active against the higher risk RNA virus families prone to

310

emergence are desperately needed.

311

We recently reported the broad-spectrum potency of the nucleoside prodrug,

312

remdesivir (RDV), against an array of epidemic, contemporary and zoonotic CoV both in

313

vitro and in vivo15,16,21,31. Currently RDV therapeutic efficacy is under investigation in

314

several human clinical trials in China, the United States and elsewhere32. Here, we

315

report the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of NHC and its orally bioavailable prodrug

316

EIDD-2801, against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and related bat-CoV in primary human

317

airway epithelial cells, as well as against the current pandemic strain SARS-CoV-2. In

318

addition, NHC is broadly active against multiple genetically distinct viruses including

319

coronaviruses, Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), influenza A and B, Ebola, and

320

Chikungunya viruses10-13,16,21,24,33-35. Here, we show that prophylactic and therapeutic

321

EIDD-2801 significantly reduced lung viral loads and improved pulmonary function in

322

mouse models of both SARS- and MERS-CoV pathogenesis. Although the

323

improvement in both SARS- and MERS-CoV outcomes diminished with the increase of

324

treatment initiation time, it is important to note that the kinetics of disease in mice are

325

compressed as compared to that in humans. While SARS- and MERS-CoV lung titers

326

peak on 2dpi in mice concurrent with the onset of clinical signs and notable damage to

327

the lung epithelium, in humans this occurs 7-10 days after the onset of

328

symptoms16,28,36,37. Thus, in mice, the window within which to treat emerging CoV

329

infection prior to peak replication is compressed (e.g., 24-48hr) but should be much

330

longer in humans. Although speculative, the SARS- and MERS-CoV in vivo data

331

provided herein suggest that 2019-nCoV will prove highly vulnerable to NHC treatment

332

modalities in vivo, critical experiments that must be performed as animal models

333

become available. The data provided in this manuscript suggest that NHC should be

334

quickly evaluated in primate models of human disease, using immediate models for

335

MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pathogenesis38,39.

336

Small molecule antivirals can exert their antiviral effect through multiple

337

mechanisms including blocking viral entry, inhibiting a virally encoded enzyme, blocking

338

virus particle formation, or targeting a host factor required for replication40. For VEE,

339

EIDD-2801 exerts its antiviral activity on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase leading

340

to error catastrophe by inducing an error rate of replication that surpasses the error

341

threshold allowed to sustain a virus population11,12. This process occurs when NHC is

342

incorporated during RNA synthesis then subsequently misread thus increasing mutation

343

rates. Therefore, the NHC MOA would appear less likely to be affected by the RNA

344

proofreading activity encoded by the nsp14 exonuclease function that otherwise limits

345

misincorperation41. Here, we present data using Primer ID NGS, a state of the art deep

346

sequencing-based approach, to quantitate the frequency and identity of the mutational

347

spectra in the MERS-CoV genome in both drug treated primary human airway cells and

348

in mice at single genome resolution25. As CoV are positive sense RNA viruses that

349

replicate through a negative sense RNA intermediate, NHC incorporation as a “C” or a

350

“U” can occur in both polarities of RNA. Using Primer ID NGS, we found increased

351

nucleotide transitions (A to G, G to A, C to U, U to C) consistent with those reported

352

after influenza and VEE infections11,12. Under identical conditions, remdesivir did not

353

alter the mutation rate in MERS-CoV genomic RNA, supporting its reported mechanism

354

of action as a chain terminator of viral RNA synthesis26. In primary human lung cell

355

cultures and mice infected with MERS-CoV, the NHC mutation rates inversely

356

correlated with a reduction in infectious virus. In addition, we found a positive correlation

357

between increased mutation rates and the frequency of nonsynonymous mutations and

358

the degree of therapeutic efficacy in mice. To explore the potential off-target effect in

359

host mRNA which may contribute to drug toxicity, we also examined the impact of NHC

360

treatment on transcripts from the highly MERS-CoV induced interferon stimulated gene

361

15 (ISG15). While ISG15 is present in great abundance, an accumulation of mutations

362

was not observed in ISG15 in this model even at 500mg/kg dosing. These data also

363

support previous studies using RNAseq to demonstrate that the model coronavirus

364

MHV displayed increased mutation frequencies following NHC treatment in vitro13. All

365

together, these data strongly support the notion that EIDD-2801 and its active

366

nucleoside analog NHC, exert their antiviral effect through the induction of error

367

catastrophe in the targeted virus. While our data suggest that the MERS-CoV nsp14

368

proofreading activity appeared ineffective against NHC in vitro and EIDD-2801 in vivo,

369

future studies should investigate the antiviral activity of NHC in the presence or absence

370

of the nsp14 proofreading activity, as loss of this activity increased the sensitivity of

371

MHV and SARS-CoV replication to remdesivir treatment41.

372

Together, our data support the continued development of EIDD-2801 as a potent

broad spectrum antiviral that could be useful in treating contemporary, newly emerged

374

and emerging coronavirus infections of the future.

Materials and Methods

377

Compounds. The parental compound b-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC, all in vitro

378

studies) and its prodrug EIDD-2801 (all in vivo studies) was supplied by Emory

379

University Institute for Drug Discovery (EIDD). NHC was supplied as a 10mM stock in

380

DMSO and EIDD-2801 as a solid and solubilized in vehicle containing 10% PEG400,

381

2.5% Cremophor RH40 in water (10/2.5/87.5%, all v/v) prior to use. Remdesivir (RDV)

382

was solubilized in 100% DMSO and provided by Gilead Sciences, Inc as previously

383

described15,16.

384

Virus strains. All viruses used for these studies were derived from infectious clones

385

and isolated as previously described42. Virus strains for in vitro experiments include

386

SARS-CoV expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in place of open reading

387

frames 7a/b (ORF7a/b, SARS-GFP)42, bat-spike receptor binding domain (Bat-SRBD)22

388

is a chimeric CoV strain derived from the HKU3 SARS-like bat coronavirus genomic

389

sequence that has the wild type (Urbani SARS-CoV strain) RBD in the HKU3 spike

390

gene to allow for virus replication in non-human primate cell lines and HAE cultures,

391

SHC014 SARS-like bat coronavirus8, MERS-CoV expressing nanoluciferase in the

392

place of ORF3 (MERS-nLUC)16 and MERS-CoV expressing the red fluorescent protein

393

gene in the place of ORF 5 (RFP, MERS-RFP)43. The virus stock utilized for MERS-

394

CoV in vivo studies was derived from a plaque purified isolate of the mouse-adapted

395

MERS-CoV p35C4 strain44. The virus stock utilized for SARS-CoV in vivo studies was

396

derived from the infectious clone of the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV MA15 (MA15)

397

strain45.

398

In vitro experiments Calu3: At 48hrs prior to infection, Calu3 2B4 cells were plated in a

399

96-well black walled clear bottom plate at 5x104 cells/well. A 10mM stock of NHC was

400

serially diluted in 100% DMSO in 3-fold increments to obtain a ten-point dilution series.

401

MERS-nLUC was diluted in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and 1% Antibiotic-

402

Antimycotic to achieve a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.08. Cells were infected and

403

treated with NHC in triplicate per drug dilution for 1hr, after which viral inoculum was

404

aspirated, cultures were rinsed once and fresh medium containing drug or vehicle was

405

added. At 48hrs post infection, nanoluciferase expression as a surrogate for virus

406

replication was quantitated on a Spectramax (Molecular Devices) plate reader

407

according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, NanoGlo). For our 100%

408

inhibition control, diluted MERS-nLUC was exposed to short-wave UV light (UVP, LLC)

409

for 6 minutes to inhibit the ability of the virus to replicate. For our 0% inhibition control,

410

cells were infected in the presence of vehicle only. DMSO was kept constant in all

411

conditions at 0.05%. Values from triplicate wells per condition were averaged and

412

compared to controls to generate a percent inhibition value for each drug dilution. The

413

IC50 value was defined as the concentration at which there was a 50% decrease in

414

luciferase expression. Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (La Jolla, CA).

415

The IC50 values were calculated by non-linear regression analysis using the dose-

416

response (variable slope) equation (four parameter logistic equation): Y = Bottom +

417

(Top-Bottom)/(1+10^((LogIC50-X)*HillSlope)). To measure cell viability to determine if

418

there was any NHC induced cytotoxicity, Calu3 2B4 cells were plated and treated with

419

NHC only as described above. Cells were exposed to the same ten-point dilution series

420

created for the in vitro efficacy studies. As above, 0.05% DMSO-treated cells served as

421

our 0% cytotoxicity control. Wells without cells served as our 100% cytotoxic positive

422

control. After 48hr, cell viability was measured on a Spectramax (Molecular Devices) via

423

Cell-Titer Glo Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Similar data

424

was obtained in three independent experiments.

425

HAE: Human tracheobronchial epithelial cells were obtained from airway specimens

426

resected from patients undergoing surgery under University of North Carolina

427

Institutional Review Board-approved protocols by the Cystic Fibrosis Center Tissue

428

Culture Core. Primary cells were expanded to generate passage 1 cells and passage 2

429

cells were plated at a density of 250,000 cells per well on Transwell-COL (12mm

430

diameter) supports. Human airway epithelium cultures (HAE) were generated by

431

provision of an air-liquid interface for 6 to 8 weeks to form well-differentiated, polarized

432

cultures that resembled in vivo pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium46.. At 48 hours

433

prior to infection the apical surface of the culture was washed with 500 µL PBS for 1.5

434

hours at 37˚C and the cultures moved into fresh air liquid interface (ALI) media.

435

Immediately prior to infection, apical surfaces were washed twice with 500 µL of PBS

436

with each wash lasting 30 minutes at 37˚C and HAE cultures were moved into ALI

437

media containing various concentrations of NHC ranging from 10 µM to 0.0016 µM as

438

indicated for each experiment (final % DMSO < 0.05%). Upon removing the second

439

PBS wash, 200 µL of viral inoculum (multiplicity of infection of (MOI) 0.5) was added to

440

the apical surface and HAE cultures were incubated for 3 hours at 37˚C. Viral inoculum

441

was then removed, and the apical surface of the cultures were washed three times with

442

500µL PBS and then incubated at 37˚C until 48 hours post infection (hpi). For all HAE

443

cultures, infectious virus produced was collected by washing the apical surface of the

444

culture with 100 µL PBS. Apical washes were stored at -80 ˚C until analysis and titered

445

by plaque assay as previously described16.

446
447

qRT-PCR approach to assess cytotoxicity: Total RNA was isolated using the Zymo

448

Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research Corp., Irvine, CA, USA) according to the

449

manufacturer’s directions. First-strand cDNA was generated using Superscript III

450

reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For quantification of

451

cellular markers of toxicity/apoptosis, real-time PCR was performed using commercially

452

validated TaqMan-based primer-probe sets (Supplementary Table 1) and TaqMan

453

Universal PCR Mix (Life Technologies). Results were then normalized as described

454

above.

Primer ID and Deep Sequencing

457

Primer ID NGS is designed to specifically identify and remove RT-PCR mutations, while

458

facilitating highly accurate sequence determination of single RNA molecules, because

459

each cDNA is created with a barcoded degenerate primer (N10, 410 combinations) from

460

which Illumina indexed libraries are made. We used a multiplexed Primer ID library prep

461

approach and MiSeq sequencing to investigate the presence of mutations in the viral

462

genomes and murine mRNA. We designed cDNA primers targeting multiple regions on

463

the viral genome and murine mRNA, each with a block of random nucleotides (11 bp

464

long) as the Primer ID25,47 (Supplementary Table 2). Viral RNA was extracted using

465

QIAamp viral RNA kit. A pre-amplification titration of templates was performed to

466

estimate the amount of template to use. We used SuperScript III to make cDNA with

467

multiplexed cDNA primers based on the regions to be sequenced. We used 41R_PID11

468

for the pilot sequencing and titration determination. For the MERS-CoV sequencing, we

469

multiplexed nsp10_PID11, nsp12_PID11 and nsp14_PID11 for the cDNA reaction; for

470

the murine mRNA sequencing, we used mixed primers of nsp10_PID11, ifit3_PID11,

471

isg15_PID11. After bead purification, we amplified the cDNA with a mixture of forward

472

primers (based on the described schemes) and a universal reverse primer, followed by

473

another round of PCR to incorporate Illumina sequencing adaptors and barcodes in the

474

amplicons. After gel-purification and quantification, we pooled 24 libraries for MiSeq 300

475

base paired-end sequencing. The TCS pipeline version 1.38

476

(https://github.com/SwanstromLab/PID) was used to process the Primer ID sequencing

477

data and construct template consensus sequences (TCSs) to represent each individual

478

input templates, and the sequences of each region in the pool was de-multiplexed. The

479

RUBY package viral_seq version 1.0.6 (https://rubygems.org/gems/viral_seq) was used

480

to calculate the mutation rate at each position.

481
482

In vivo experiments. We performed 4 mouse studies to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of

483

the NHC prodrug (EIDD-2801). First, we performed prophylactic dose escalation studies

484

for both SARS- and MERS-CoV to determine the most efficacious dose of EIDD-2801

485

per virus. For SARS-CoV, in cohorts of equivalent numbers of male and female 20-29

486

week old SPF C57BL/6J (Stock 000664 Jackson Labs) mice (n = 10/dose group), we

487

administered vehicle (10% PEG, 2.5% Cremophor RH40 in water) or 50, 150 or

488

500mg/kg EIDD-2801 by oral gavage 2hr prior to intranasal infection with 1E+04 PFU

489

mouse-adapted SARS-CoV strain MA15 in 50µl. Mice were anaesthetized with a

490

mixture of ketamine/xylazine prior to intranasal infection. Vehicle or drug was

491

administered every 12hr for the remainder of the study. Body weight and pulmonary

492

function by whole body plethysmography was measured daily. On 5dpi, animals were

493

sacrificed by isoflurane overdose, lungs were scored for lung hemorrhage, and the

494

inferior right lobe was frozen at −80°C for viral titration via plaque assay. Briefly,

500,000 Vero E6 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates. The following day, medium

was removed and serial dilutions of clarified lung homogenate were added per plate (10-

1X DMEM, 5% Fetal Clone 2 serum, 1X antibiotic/antimycotic, 0.8% agarose. Two days

499

after, plaques were enumerated to generate a plaque/ml value. Lung hemorrhage is a

500

gross pathological phenotype readily observed by the naked eye driven by the degree

501

of virus replication where the coloration of the lung changes from pink to dark red48,49.

502

The large left lobe was placed in 10 % buffered formalin and stored at 4°C for 1-3

503

weeks until histological sectioning and analysis. For MERS-CoV, the prophylactic dose

504

escalation studies we performed exactly as done for SARS-CoV with the following

505

exceptions. First, MERS-CoV binds the human receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to

506

gain entry into cells and two residues (288 and 330) in the binding interface of mouse

507

DPP4 prevent infection of mice. We recently developed a mouse model for MERS-CoV

508

through the mutation of mouse DPP4 at 288 and 330 thus humanizing the receptor

509

(hDPP4) and rendering mice susceptible to MERS-CoV infection28. We performed all in

510

vivo studies with EIDD-2801 in equivalent numbers of 10-14 week old female and male

511

C57BL/6J hDPP4 mice. Second, we intranasally infected mice with 5E+04 PFU mouse-

512

adapted MERS-CoV strain M35C4 in 50µl. Third, to titer lungs by plaque assay, Vero

CCL81 cells were used and plaques were enumerated 3 days post infection.

to 10-6 dilutions) and incubated at 37˚C for 1hr after which wells were overlayed with

To determine the time at which therapeutic administration of EIDD-2801 would

515

fail to improve outcomes with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection, we performed

516

therapeutic efficacy studies in mice where we initiated treatment 2hr prior to infection or

517

12, 24 or 48hr after infection. As 500mg/kg provided the most complete protection from

518

disease in prophylactic SARS-CoV studies, this dose was used for both therapeutic

519

efficacy studies. Vehicle or EIDD-2801 was given via oral gavage twice daily following

520

initiation of treatment. For both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the infectious dose for the

521

therapeutic studies and the mouse strains were the same as that used in the

522

prophylactic studies. The numbers of mice per group for the SARS-CoV studies were as

523

follows: Vehicle (n = 10), -2hr (n = 10), +12hr (n = 10), +24hr (n = 10), +48hr (n = 10).

524

The numbers of mice per group for the MERS-CoV therapeutic studies were as follows:

above, each day mouse body weight and pulmonary function was quantitated. On 5dpi

527

for SARS-CoV and 6dpi for MERS-CoV, animals were humanely sacrificed and tissues

528

were harvested and analyzed as described above. In addition, for the MERS-CoV study,

529

lung tissue was harvested and stored in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher) at -80˚C and then

530

thawed, homogenized in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and total RNA was isolated using a

531

Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research). This total RNA was then used for Primer

532

ID and qRT-PCR.

533

Whole body plethysmography. Pulmonary function was monitored once daily via

534

whole-body plethysmography (Buxco Respiratory Solutions, DSI Inc.). Mice destined for

535

this analysis were chosen prior to infection. Briefly, after a 30-minute acclimation time in

536

the plethysmograph, data for 11 parameters was recorded every 2 seconds for 5

537

minutes.

538

Acute lung injury histological assessment tools. Two different and complementary

539

quantitative histologic tools were used to determine if antiviral treatments diminished the

540

histopathologic features associated with lung injury. Both analyses and scoring were

541

performed by a Board Certified Veterinary Pathologist who was blinded to the treatment

542

groups.

543

American Thoracic Society Lung Injury Scoring Tool. In order to help quantitate

544

histological features of ALI observed in mouse models and increase their translation to

545

the human condition, we used the ATS scoring tool49. In a blinded manner, we chose

546

three random diseased fields of lung tissue at high power (60 ×), which were scored for

547

the following: (A) neutrophils in the alveolar space (none = 0, 1–5 cells = 1, > 5 cells =

548

2), (B) neutrophils in the interstitial space/ septae (none = 0, 1–5 cells = 1, > 5 cells = 2),

549

(C) hyaline membranes (none = 0, one membrane = 1, > 1 membrane = 2), (D)

550

Proteinaceous debris in air spaces (none = 0, one instance = 1, > 1 instance = 2), (E)

551

alveolar septal thickening (< 2× mock thickness = 0, 2–4× mock thickness = 1, > 4×

552

mock thickness = 2). To obtain a lung injury score per field, the scores for A–E were

553

then put into the following formula, which contains multipliers that assign varying levels

554

of importance for each phenotype of the disease state.: score = [(20x A) + (14 x B) + (7

556

to obtain a final score ranging from 0 to and including 1.

557

Diffuse Alveolar Damage (DAD) Tool. The second histological tool to quantitate lung

558

injury was reported by Schmidt et al.50. DAD is the pathological hallmark of ALI49,50.

559

Three random diseased fields of lung tissue were score at high power (60 × ) for the

560

following in a blinded manner: 1 = absence of cellular sloughing and necrosis, 2 =

561

Uncommon solitary cell sloughing and necrosis (1–2 foci/field), 3 = multifocal (3 + foci)

562

cellular sloughing and necrosis with uncommon septal wall hyalinization, or 4 =

563

multifocal ( >75% of field) cellular sloughing and necrosis with common and/or

564

prominent hyaline membranes. The scores for the three fields per mouse were

565

averaged to get a final DAD score per mouse.

566

MERS-CoV genomic RNA qRT-PCR. Mouse lungs were stored in RNAlater

567

(ThermoFisher) at -80°C until processed via homogenization in TRIzol (Invitrogen).

568

Total RNA was isolated using Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research). Previously

569
