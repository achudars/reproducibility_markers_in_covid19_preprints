Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus which has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Other known
coronaviruses show a strong pattern of seasonality, with the infection cases in humans being more
prominent in winter. Although several plausible origins of such seasonal variability have been
proposed, its mechanism is unclear. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne droplets ejected from
the upper respiratory tract of the infected individuals. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can
remain infectious for hours on surfaces. As such, the stability of viral particles both in liquid droplets
as well as dried on surfaces is essential for infectivity. Here we have used atomic force microscopy to
examine the structural stability of individual SARS-CoV-2 virus like particles at different temperatures.
We demonstrate that even a mild temperature increase, commensurate with what is common for
summer warming, leads to dramatic disruption of viral structural stability, especially when the heat is
applied in the dry state. This is consistent with other existing non-mechanistic studies of viral
infectivity, provides a single particle perspective on viral seasonality, and strengthens the case for a
resurgence of COVID-19 in winter.
Statement of Scientific Significance
The economic and public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are very significant. However
scientific information needed to underpin policy decisions are limited partly due to novelty of the
SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. There is therefore an urgent need for mechanistic studies of both COVID-19
disease and the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We show that individual virus particles suffer structural
destabilization at relatively mild but elevated temperatures. Our nanoscale results are consistent with
recent observations at larger scales. Our work strengthens the case for COVID-19 resurgence in
winter.

Introduction
SARS-COV-2 is a virus of zoonotic origin which was first identified in humans in late 2019 [1]. Similar
to other coronaviridae[2], the viral particles are enveloped and polymorphic decorated by a variable
number of S protein spikes on their membrane[3]. One of the most confusing and yet urgently
pressing questions at the time of this writing is whether the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARSCoV-2 will show seasonal character. Climate and seasonal dependence was expected early in the
pandemic [4] due to similarity with other human coronavirus diseases [5], however the rates of
infections have failed to strongly decline in the summer of 2020, leading to widespread doubts about
COVID-19 seasonality. At the same time, a mounting body of evidence, from theoretical studies [6] to
experimental research on viral populations and their infectivity [7,8] suggest that seasonality is indeed
to be expected. However an understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 survives different environmental
conditions is still incomplete and mechanisms of virus particle degradation are poorly mapped out.
This then creates uncertainty for public health policy and its forward projection.
A key challenge in studying SARS-CoV-2 is the extreme level of threat associated with the live virus
and the resultant need for high safety standards for such work. Aside from the envelope and S
proteins, SARS-CoV-2 also packages the positive sense RNA genome encapsidated with thousands
of copies of nucleocapsid, N proteins. SARS-CoV-2 also packages thousands of copies of matrix
protein (M) which consists of three membrane spanning helixes with small intraluminal and extra
luminal domains. In addition, an unknown number of envelope (E) proteins, which contain a single
membrane spanning helix, are also packaged in each virion.
We have previously shown that similar to SARS-CoV [9], the expression of SARS-CoV-2 M, E, and S
proteins in transfected human cells is sufficient for the formation and release of virus like particles
(VLPs) through the same biological pathway as used by the fully infectious virus [10]. These VLPs
faithfully mimic the external structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The VLPs however, possess no
genome and thus present no infectious threat which enables rapid studies with reduced safety
requirements. The ability to produce non-infectious VLPs further enabled us to devise and rapidly
validate novel strategies for manipulation of these particles, most notably via the addition of protein
tags to the S and M proteins (these findings are detailed in a separate manuscript).
Here, we report studies of VLPs subjected to variable temperature conditions before or after being
immobilized and dried out on a functionalized glass surface. We show that exposure of VLPs to a
mildly elevated temperature (34 C) for as little as 30 minutes is sufficient to induce structural
degradation. The effect is weaker for particles exposed to elevated temperatures in solution and

stronger for exposure in the dry state. Overall, these results provide insight into the viral seasonality
of SARS-CoV-2.
RESULTS
During initial refinement of VLP purification strategies and associated VLP characterization [10],
we have found that such particles remain stable for at least a week if stored in liquid buffer at near 0
°C conditions (on ice). We therefore examined whether they would remain stable at room temperature
under dry conditions on a model surface (Fig. 1). Spytag-S VLPs were adhered to microtubules (MTs)
via spycatcher-Kinesin and these complexes were abundantly retained on poly-L-lysinated glass
surfaces. The shapes observed via AFM imaging at 22 °C (Fig. 1A) have nearly monodisperse sizes
and only slight shape variability consistent with individual VLPs. Features indicative of envelope
disruption and VLP aggregation are rare. Note that individual MTs are usually washed out during
sample preparation leaving behind characteristic depressions in the poly-L-lysinated surface. In
addition, surface clumping of poly-L-lysine is discernible in the AFM data as background height
inhomogeneity. Identically prepared samples imaged via AFM at 34 °C under dry conditions (Fig. 1B)
are harder to image stably due to high amount of background noise which obscures poly-L-lysine
inhomogeneity and MT washout sites (likely due to loose debris on the surface – plausibly a byproduct of particle degradations). Features consistent with intact VLPs are prominent relative to noise
levels and hence easy to resolve (Fig. 2), but they are so exceedingly rare at 34 °C that they are
considered outliers (Fig. 3). They were seen in large area surveys in which each particle is
mechanically probed only a few times. Such particles do not survive intact during even a single
detailed zoomed-in scan (Fig. 2). It takes 20-30 minutes to install the sample into the AFM, approach
the surface and validate tip condition. Therefore mildly elevated temperature has a rapid effect on
VLP integrity. VLPs incubated at 34 °C in solution and imaged at room temperature (Fig. 1C) survive
better than particles at 34 °C under dry conditions but still often appear disrupted or aggregated in
AFM imaging.
DISCUSSION
A common transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 is through bioaerosols created during sharp
exhalation events such as sneezing or coughing. The bioaerosol droplets tend to dry out quickly due
to high surface area and small volume [11,12]. Therefore virus particles may be exposed to both wet
and dry conditions before coming into contact with and infecting the next host. It is widely recognized
that virus particles often spread after their deposition on various surfaces [13] (although direct contact
of the next host with contaminated bioaerosol may also be a viable route) and it is therefore also

appreciated that virus particles can survive on various surfaces for an extended length of time[14].
The ability to make VLPs based on the SARS-CoV-2 genome, combined with abundant
available structural information allowing for high precision design strategies for the VLPs, opens a
unique opportunity for fast progress and allowed us to overcome the safety concerns associated with
experiments on the full virus. Here we used this technology to study the stability of the viral envelope
and associated proteins (M, E, and S) under different environmental conditions. As might be expected
a priori, the VLPs do indeed degrade when exposed to elevated temperatures. Our AFM imaging
revealed that negligibly few particles retain their shape and even those exceptional particles
degraded nearly instantly during scanning and hence are likely already structurally impaired. The
unexpected finding is how little heating it takes to degrade VLPs – just 34 °C was sufficient for a
dramatic effect. Surfaces at 34 °C are warm to the touch but not hot. Such conditions are likely
widespread in many locales for outdoors surfaces. In contrast, surfaces at 22 °C do not promote rapid
VLP degradation, suggesting that surfaces commonly found indoors and the surfaces located
outdoors during colder seasons may allow for prolonged viral survival and possibly extended viral
spread. It is hard to estimate how all individual contributing factors would contribute to the
epidemiological picture on the ground. Nonetheless, our findings draw parallels between the stability
of SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS viruses [15] and add to a growing body of research suggesting
more viral spread is likely at lower temperatures via a variety of possible contributing factors [6].
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Glass and MT preparation
Glass coverslips (VWR, Radnor, PA) were cleaned with dd-H2O and Ethanol. Clean slides were
treated with 0.01% w/v Poly-L-Lysine (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA) for 30 min, washed and dried.
Porcine microtubules (Cytoskeleton, Denver, Co) were polymerized according to manufacturer’s
instructions with ~140mM of tubulin concentration. MTs were further diluted 30x in assay buffer
(35mM PIPES, 5mM MgSo4, 1mM EGTA, 0.5mM EDTA, 10mM GTP and 40µm Taxol) at pH 7.2.
VLP functionalization
VLPs suspended in PBS buffer were mixed at 4oC with KIF5B-spycatcher in (buffer) for 7-8
hours on a nutating mixer (VWR, Radnor, PA) to ensure Spy Tag-Spy Catcher binding. Different
mixing concentrations of VLPs and KIF5B-spycatcher construct were tested. Excessively high
concentration of KIF5B-spycatcher led to the formation of large aggregates of VLPs (~350-600nm
lateral dimensions) while low concentrations of KIF5B-spycatcher led to reduced MT-VLP binding.
Optimum binding of tagged S-protein with KIF5B-spycatcher resulted in predominantly single VLPs

bound to MTs. MT were incubated with the KIF5B-spycatcher + VLP solution for 30 min at 4oC. VLPs
attached on the MT were pelleted by spinning the solution at low speeds of 2500 rpm for 10 min in
assay buffer. MT-VLP complexes were gently resuspended (buffer: 35mM PIPES, 5mM MgSo4, 1mM
EGTA, 0.5mM EDTA, 10mM GTP and 40um Taxol) and then incubated on the Poly-L-Lysine
functionalized glass surface for 20 min followed by H2O wash and gentle drying under nitrogen gas
flow.
AFM imaging and Temperature measurements
AFM experiments were performed using Dimension Icon AFM with an MLCT-BIO-DC probe
(Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) in PeakForce QNM in air mode at room temperature (Scientific
reports ref). The AFM was located on a dedicated optical table and featured a full acoustic enclosure.
A small heater was placed in the enclosure to increase the temperature of the AFM chamber.
Temperature was allowed to equilibrate prior to experiments and was measured using manufacturer
calibrated NIST-traceable Thermo Hygrometer Barometer PCE-THB 40 (PCE Instruments, Jupiter,
FL).
Recombinant Protein purification
A constitutively active version of the human kinesin-1 motor truncation HsKIF5B(1-560) (K560
here after) was used in this work. To generate the K560-mScarlet-Strep-SpyCatcher construct, the
coding sequences of human K560 (or its rigor mutant, K560-T92N), fluorophore mScarlet and Strep
tag (WSHPQFEK) were amplified by PCR. The coding sequence of SpyCatcher was synthesized by
IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies). These fragments were cloned into a pET28a-based vector using
Gibson assembly. Flexible linkers (AAA, LE and GSGS) were introduced between these elements
giving a final construct composed of K560-AAA-mScarlet-LE-StrepII-GSGS-SpyCatcher. All
constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.
The recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells in 2x YT medium. The cells
were grown at 37 oC until an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.5, then induced with 0.2 mM
isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) 4 hours at 180C. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer,
containing protein buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM MgSO4, 1 mM
EGTA, 5% glycerol) and freshly supplemented reagents (1 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM PMSF,
protease inhibitor mix (Promega) and 1% Tween 20), then the cells were lysed using an Emusiflex C3 (Avestin). To purify the proteins, cell lysates were treated with nuclease and incubated with Strep
XT beads for 1 hour then washed with lysis buffer and eluted by elution buffer (protein buffer plus 100
mM biotin and 0.1% NP-40). The proteins were subsequently purified by anion exchange using a
Mono Q column (GE Healthcare) in HB buffer (35 mM PIPES-KOH pH 7.2, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.2 mM

EGTA, 0.1 mM EDTA) with salt gradient from 200 mM to 500 mM. To further purify the proteins, the
Mono Q elutions containing desired proteins were further purified by concentration on Amicon Ultra
filters followed by size-exclusion chromatograph using a Superdex 200 10/30 GL column (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences) in GF150 buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM
MgCl2) with 0.01% NP-40.

Fig. S1 A comparison of features seen at 22 °C and 34 °C in 4 um x 4 um fields of view. VLPs and
MT washout sites are readily identifiable for scans at room temperature, but are difficult to see with an
identical colormap presentation due to elevated background noise. However, artificially extending the
z range of the data helps reveal the presence of MT washout sites (right panel, washout site
highlighted with red oval). Faint modulation in the rightmost image is most likely due to electronic
noise in the imaging system although a mechanical vibration noise contribution cannot be excluded.
