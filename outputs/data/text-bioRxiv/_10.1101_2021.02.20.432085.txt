Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is regarded as an endothelial disease (endothelialitis)
with its mechanism being incompletely understood. Emerging evidence has demonstrated
that the endothelium represents the Achilles' heel in COVID-19 patients and that endothelial
dysfunction precipitates COVID-19 and accompanying multi-organ injuries. Thus,
pharmacotherapies targeting endothelial dysfunction have potential to ameliorate COVID-19
and its cardiovascular complications. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs) and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) were treated
with serum from control subjects or COVID-19 patients. Downstream monocyte adhesion
and associated gene/protein expression was evaluated in endothelial cells exposed to
COVID-19 patient serum in the presence of KLF2 activator (Atorvastatin) or KLF2
overexpression by an adenoviral vector. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of KLF2
was significantly reduced and monocyte adhesion was increased in endothelial cells treated
with COVID-19 patient serum due to elevated levels of pro-adhesive molecules, ICAM1 and
VCAM1. IL-1β and TNF-α, two cytokines observed in cytokine release syndrome in
COVID-19 patients, decreased KLF2 gene expression. Next-generation RNA-sequencing
data showed that atorvastatin treatment leads to a cardiovascular protective transcriptome
associated with improved endothelial function (vasodilation, anti-inflammation, antioxidant
status, anti-thrombosis/-coagulation, anti-fibrosis and reduced angiogenesis). Treatment of
HPMECs with atorvastatin or KLF2 adenovirus ameliorate COVID-19 serum-induced
increase in endothelial inflammation and monocyte adhesion by increasing KLF2 expression.
Altogether, the present study demonstrates that genetic and pharmacological activation of
KLF2 represses COVID-19 associated endothelial dysfunction, heralding a potentially new
direction to treat endothelialitis accompanying COVID-19.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe, yet still ongoing infectious disease
caused by a new type of coronavirus-SARS-CoV-2 (1). The pandemic has posed a great
threat to public health and imposed tremendous economic burden worldwide. Cardiovascular
complications are rapidly emerging as a new threat in COVID-19, and these complications
can last even in patients recently recovered from COVID-19, indicate the necessity of
assessing the long-term cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19 (2). However, the
mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection induced dysfunction in the cardiovascular
system, remain largely unknown. Since the discovery of viral inclusion structures and
inflammatory cell infiltration as well interaction with endothelium in endothelial cells from
various vascular beds from patient tissues (3), COVID-19 is considered as an endothelial
disease (4), in which multiple aspects of endothelial dysfunction (such as oxidative stress,
mitochondrial dysfunction, endothelial cell death, inflammation, glycocalyx disruption,
altered cell metabolism etc) occur (5).
The vascular endothelium is not a static bystander, but a metabolically active paracrine,
endocrine, and autocrine organ critical for the regulation of vascular tone and homoeostasis,
highlighting the possibility that the endothelium represents the Achilles’ heel in COVID-19
patients (6). In particular, in the cascade of injurious responses triggered by cytokine storm
accompanying COVID-19, the sentinel vascular endothelium could become dysfunctional,
leading to imbalance of tissue homeostasis and ensuing injury. Further elucidation of its
pathogenic mechanism is important for developing effective treatments.
In this study, we aim to address the underlying mechanism of endothelial dysfunction in
COVID-19 by treating human endothelial cells with serum from COVID-19 patients. We
observed that the gene and protein expression of kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), a master
regulator of vascular homeostasis, was decreased in endothelial cells treated with serum from
COVID-19 patients and that genetic or pharmacological activation of KLF2 reverses multiple
aspects of endothelial dysfunction. Our study offers a new target for therapeutic intervention
of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19.

Results
1. Patient demographic data
A total of eight severe COVID-19 patients and eight disease-free control patients were
used for collecting serum. Demographic data of patients are summarized in Table S1.
2. COVID-19 patient serum treated human endothelial cells show KLF2
downregulation, and associated eNOS downregulation, and endothelial inflammation
To test the hypothesis that COVID-19 patients’ serum can cause endothelial dysfunction,
we first treated HUVECs with control serum or patient serum for 24 h. Proteins and RNA
were collected for western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis, respectively.
Our data demonstrate that patient serum treatment leads to decreased KLF2 and eNOS
protein expression, while increasing ICAM1 and VCAM1 protein expression. qPCR analysis
revealed that KLF2, eNOS (also known as NOS3), Thrombomodulin (Thbd) were decreased

by patient serum treatment, while VCAM1 gene expression was increased by patient serum
treatment (Figure 1).
3. KLF2 is downregulated by components of cytokine storm- TNF-α, and IL-1β
It has been well recognized that COVID-19 is a cytokine release syndrome, in which
heightened secretion of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and many others can trigger inflammatory cell
death, local tissue damage as well as systemic multi-organ failure (7). We evaluated whether
TNF-α, and IL-1β, two cytokines observed in COVID-19 patients, can decrease KLF2 gene
expression. Our data showed that both TNF-α, and IL-1β significantly decreased KLF2 gene
expression (Figure 2).
4. Transcriptional profiling of human endothelial cells treated with atorvastatin in the
presence of patient serum
Since statins have reported benefits in cardiovascular outcome in COVID-19 patients (8,
9) and statins are known potent pharmacological KLF2 activators(10, 11). We postulated that
KLF2 activation represent one contributing mechanism to COVID-19 associated endothelial
dysfunction. We thus performed RNA-sequencing in HUVECs treated with atorvastatin in the
presence of patient serum . Our data showed that atorvastatin treatment leads to an overall
protective transcriptomic profile (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, anti-fibrotic,
anti-angiogenesis and anti-thrombotic), which may underscore the potential benefits of statins
in COVID-19 treatment (Figure 3).
5. Atorvastatin regulates the expression of genes relevant to endothelial dysfunction in
endothelial cells exposed to patient serum
We further performed qPCR to validate our RNA-sequencing data. Our qPCR data
showed that atorvastatin treatment leads to the upregulation of vascular homeostasis related
genes (KLF2, KLF4, eNOS, and Thbd), antioxidant genes (NQO1). However, atorvastatin
treatment reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (VCAM1, CCL2 and DKK1),
vasoconstrictory gene (EDN-1) and anti-angiogenic gene (Angpt2) (Figure 4). These data are
of translational significance as increased pulmonary vascular endothelialitis, thrombosis, and
angiogenesis are observed in COVID-19 patients (12, 13). In addition, atorvastatin reduces
the expression of Angpt2, which emerges a biomarker of endothelial activation in COVID-19
and predicts COVID-19 patients to be admitted to ICU (14) .
6. KLF2 overexpression modulates the expression of genes relevant to endothelial
dysfunction in endothelial cells exposed to patient serum
Since atorvastatin is a pharmacological activator of KLF2, we next asked whether
overexpression of KLF2 via an adenoviral vector can also reverse patient serum induced
endothelial dysfunction. Our qPCR data showed that atorvastatin treatment leads to the
upregulation of vascular homeostasis related genes (KLF2, eNOS, and Thbd), antioxidant
genes (GCLM and NQO1). However, atorvastatin treatment reduces the expression of
pro-inflammatory genes (VCAM1, CCL2 and DKK1), vasoconstricotry gene (EDN-1) and
anti-angiogenic gene (Angpt2) (Figure 5).

7. Genetic and pharmacological activation of KLF2 reduced monocyte adhesion to
patient serum treated endothelial cells
A recent report has observed significant accumulation of inflammatory cells associated
with endothelium, as well as apoptotic bodies (3). In particular, the myocardial arterioles and
venules of the COVID-19 patients showed mild to moderate inflammatory infiltrates rich in
lympho-monocytic cells (15). However, how these lympho-monocytic cells infiltration in
affected tissues/organs was increased is unknown. To this end, genetic and pharmacological
activation of KLF2 have been established to reduce monocyte adhesion to activated
endothelium (16, 17). We thus investigated the role of KLF2 overexpression and atorvastatin
on COVID-19 serum induced monocyte adhesion. Our data demonstrate that both KLF2
overexpression (by KLF2 adenovirus) and activation (by Atorvastatin) significantly reduces
monocyte adhesion (Figure 6), providing a proof-of-concept of KLF2 activation in treating
endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19.
Discussion
Emerging histopathological evidence from COVID-19 patients have underscored the
pivotal role of endothelial cell dysfunction, thrombosis/coagulation, and systemic
inflammation in COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection (3, 18). Consecutive
inflammatory/immune cell recruitment and endothelial dysfunction could explain
microcirculation failure and systemic endotheliitis observed in various vascular beds (15, 19).
Mechanistically, elevated levels of TNF-α, interferons, IL-1β, IL-6, chemokines (CCL2 or
MCP1), and PAI-1 in cytokine storm (20), could relay the chain of endothelial dysfunction,
consisting of vasoconstriction, cell injury/death, hyperpermeability, and leukocyte
recruitment in the microvasculature. Therapeutic strategies targeting endothelial
inflammatory responses and dysfunction could restore the quiescent endothelium and
improve multi-organ endotheliitis and injury (21).
Endothelial dysfunction and endothelialtis in COVID-19
A landmark histopathological study has shown direct SARS-CoV-2 viral infection of
endothelial cells evidenced by the presence of viral elements within endothelial cells and the
accumulation of inflammatory cells (3). These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection
facilitates endotheliitis in several organs.
Since this discovery (3), the importance of
endothelial activation and dysfunction in COVID-19 has been intensively pursued (4, 15, 19,
22). More recently, increased markers of vascular inflammation (23), oxidative stress (24),
coagulation (12), angiogenesis (12), mitochondrial dysfunction (25), altered endothelial cell
metabolism (glycolysis) (25), glycocalyx disruption (26) have been observed in patients with
COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein treated endothelial cells (reviewed in (5)).
However, the precise mechanism underlying these features of endothelial dysfunction and
COVID-19 is largely unknown. Studies focusing on endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19
patients are warranted as to decipher their precise role in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and
multi-organ dysfunction and to identify targets for further interventions (27).
In a recent study, spike protein alone can damage endothelial cells in an
AMPK-dependent manner, evidenced by mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced ACE2
expression and eNOS expression and NO bioavailability, and altered endothelial cell

metabolism (increased glycolysis) (25). In addition, chloroquine, a disputed anti-COVID-19
medication, may induce endothelial injury/cytotoxicity through lysosomal dysfunction and
oxidative stress, the effect of which can be ameliorated by treatment with lysosomal enzyme
α-galactosidase A. This suggests that endothelial cell injury may contribute to the failure of
chloroquine as effective therapy for COVID-19 partially due to lysosomal dysfunction
elicited by chloroquine (28). All these evidences indicate that the endothelium is bona fide a
key target for devising anti-COVID-19 therapeutics.
However, there are no pharmacotherapies available which specifically target the
diseased vascular endothelium in affected organs from COVID-19 patients. Several clinical
trials are currently underway to explore this concept. Anti-inflammatory therapies such as
colchicine, and tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibodies) are tested for clinical
intervention of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 patients (www.clinicaltrial.gov). In our
study, we observed that COVID-19 patient serum treated human endothelial cells show
features of endothelial dysfunction, including increased monocyte adhesion to activated
endothelium, concurrent with decreased expression of vasoprotective molecule KLF2 and
eNOS, and increased expression of ICAM1, and VCAM1, raising the possibility that KLF2
serves as a new and promising target for therapeutic intervention of endothelial dysfunction
accompanying COVID-19 (Figure S1).
KLF2 as a negative regulator of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19
Previous studies have shown that KLF2 is a negative regulator of endothelial
activation, dysfunction and thrombosis (29-32). This notion is supported by evidence
showing that KLF2 downregulation by treatments with various inflammatory cytokines, such
as TNF-α (33) and IL-1β (17), two of which are frequently observed cytokine storm in
COVID-19 patients (7). We reproduced the downregulation of KLF2 expression by TNF-α
and IL-1β, and further demonstrated that forced overexpression of KLF2 suppressed patient
serum induced inflammatory gene and protein (ICAM1 and VCAM1) expression and
monocyte adhesion to activated endothelial cells in vitro. In addition, KLF2 overexpression
reversed patient serum induced eNOS downregulation, indicating that SRAS-CoV2 infection
induced cytokine storm disrupts endothelial homeostasis. Therefore, based on our data and
published literature (29), it is plausible that KLF2 suppresses COVID-19 induced endothelial
dysfunction by multiple mechanisms which may involve: 1) enhancing endothelial
quiescence and pulmonary vascular integrity; 2) boosting eNOS dependent NO production; 3)
inhibiting ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin mediated monocyte adhesion via reported
suppressing NF-kB signaling pathway; 4) hemostatic and anti-thrombotic function mediated
by thrombomodulin upregulation and PAI-1 downregulation. In our study, we observed that
KLF2 was downregulated by COVID-19 patient serum, which disclose a novel mechanism of
KLF2 in suppressing endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19. We also observed that
adenovirus mediated KLF2 overexpression or atorvastatin reversed COVID-19 patient serum
induced monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, suggesting that pharmacological activation
of KLF2 could be a viable strategy of ameliorating endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19.
Based on the protective effects of KLF2 activation, in addition to statins, several drugs
or compounds, such as resveratrol (a wine-derived phytochemical) (34), metformin (35),
liraglutide (36) have been shown to exert cardiovascular protective actions via KLF2

upregulation. By virtue of the anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties mediated by
KLF2 activation, these drugs/compounds would be expected to lower COVID-19-associated
endothelial dysfunction and mortality.
Mechanism of statin-mediated protective effects against COVID-19
The use of statins was associated with reduced risk for 28-day all-cause mortality, a
lower risk of developing severe COVID-19, and faster recovery time (8, 9). However, the
protective mechanism of statins in COVID-19 is unclear. We found that statins may be
effective by ameliorating endothelial dysfunction triggered by cytokine storm
cytokines/chemokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, CCL2, interferons etc) released from COVID-19
patients. The possible reasons for statins mediated suppressive effects on endothelial
dysfunction are partially due to increased KLF2 expression and regulates the expression of its
downstream genes, which includes NF-kB-dependent pro-inflammatory genes (VCAM-1,
SELE, CCL2), thrombotic genes (Thrombomodulin, Thromborespondin 1), vascular
homeostasis associated genes (eNOS and ET-1 etc). Since statins are pleiotropic drugs with
both lipid-lowering and cholesterol-independent effects, both of which may be accountable
for the pharmacological effects of statins in COVID-19 patients. In addition, SARS-CoV-2
use ACE2 receptor to achieve entry into host cells, however, the endothelium of the major
coronary arteries of COVID-19-positive was devoid of ACE2 receptor expression (15),
raising the existence of alternative receptors in endothelial cells. In our study, we do observe
that atorvastatin treatment leads to dramatic decrease in the expression of AXL, a new
candidate receptor which binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and facilitates
SARS-CoV-2 entry into ACE2-lowly expressed host cells (37), such as the coronary artery
endothelial cells. Therefore, the effect of statins on SARS-CoV-2 entry into host endothelial
cells is also possible.
Study limitations
We recognized that the present study has two limitations. First, in light of the presence
of SARS-CoV-2 viral inclusion elements within endothelial cells (3), the transcriptomic
profile of SARS-CoV-2 infected human microvascular endothelial cells from different
vascular beds are warranted to elucidate the gene expression profile after SARS-CoV-2
infection; Second, due to inaccessibility of post-mortem tissues from COVID-19 patients,
further detection of KLF2 expression in vascular endothelium from vascular beds from small
vessels (such as cardiac capillaries, arterioles and venules) and whether KLF2 expression
negatively correlates with increased vascular inflammation, the severity of COVID-19,
inflammatory biomarkers and coagulopathy remains to be evaluated.
Conclusion
The present study uncovers KLF2 downregulation as an important mechanism
responsible for COVID-19 induced endothelial dysfunction as well as underscores
importance of examining endothelial function in patients recently recovered from COVID-19.
From a translational perspective, out study suggests that genetic and pharmacological
activation of KLF2 have potential to ameliorate COVID-19 associated endothelial
dysfunction, pinpointing a new direction to treat endothelialitis accompanying the devastating

pandemic COVID-19.

Materials and methods
1. Patient demographic data
Serum samples were collected from eight confirmed COVID-19 patients as described in
our previous cohort (38). All patients were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
infection and discharged after meeting the National Recovery Standard of COIVD-19
stipulated by the National Health Committee of China. Clinical demographic information and
laboratory testing data (Table S1), including age, sex, comorbidities, smoking history,
treatment, complete blood counts, blood biochemistry were collected at the time of admission
and throughout the course. A subfraction of patients were followed up for various blood tests.
Control serum were collected from normal human subjects. This study was conducted under a
clinical protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of First Affiliated
Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (protocol number:
2020-XG(H)-009). All participants all agreed to participate in the study and signed informed
consents approved by the IRB.
2. Drug and adenovirus
Atorvastatin was purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI), and KLF2
overexpression adenovirus with a C-terminal Flag/His tag was custom made at Weizhen
Biochem Inc. (Qingdao, Shandong, China).
3. Cell culture
HUVECs were isolated from normal pregnant women according to our published
protocols with informed consent (39). Three to four different donors of HUVECs were used
in this study unless specified otherwise. HUVECs were cultured in ECM media
supplemented with 1X endothelial cell growth supplement (ScienCell, Carlsbad, CA), 1X
penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic, and 5% FBS. Cells at passage number of 2-4 were used in
this study. HPMECs were purchased from ScienCell (Carlsbad, CA) under the identical
culture conditions to HUVECs. Endothelial cells were authenticated by staining with
endothelial cell marker proteins-CD31 and VE-cadherin as well as DiI-oxLDL uptake.
4. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from cultured human ECs using a RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen).
For reverse transcription, total RNA was converted into first strand complementary DNA
(cDNA) using a Reverse Transcription Kit (Takara) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Quantitative real-time PCR was then performed with a Roche LC96 Real-Time PCR
Detection System, using SYBR Green Supermix (Roche) for relative mRNA quantification.
The sequences of all the primers used were listed in Table S2.
5. Western blot analysis.
Whole cell lysates were prepared from cultured cells. For Western blots (39), total cell
lysates (15-20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane

(Pall, East Hills, NY) and were subsequently blocked in LI-COR blocking buffer (LI-COR
Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) at room temperature for 1 h. Then, the blots were incubated
overnight at 4 °C with appropriate primary antibodies listed in Table S3. Then after being
washed 3 times with 1 X Tris buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST), membranes were
incubated with IRDye® 680RD Goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) or IRDye® 800CW Goat
anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) (1:10,000 dilution in 1XTBST; LI-COR) at room temperature for 30
min. Images were visualized by using an LiCor-CLX Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR).
6. Assay of monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells
Human THP-1 monocyte adhesion assay was performed as we previously described (39,
40). In brief, HUVECs were incubated with 20% patient serum (combined from 2 patients
with 1:1 ratio) or control serum for 24 h before addition of THP-1 monocytic cells (1.5X104)
for 30 min. Non-adherent cells were washed and images were taken. Three images at
different optic fields were taken for assessing the number of adherent monocytes.
7. Next-generation RNA-sequencing
HUVECs were treated with atorvastatin (10 uM) for 24 h before treatment with
COVID-19 patient serum for 24 h. After that, RNA was extracted using the RNA Minieasy
Kit (Qiagen). The sequencing data was filtered with SOAPnuke (v1.5.2) by (1) Removing
reads containing sequencing adapter; (2) Removing reads whose low-quality base ratio (base
quality less than or equal to 5) is more than 20%; (3) Removing reads whose unknown base
('N' base) ratio is more than 5%, afterwards clean reads were obtained and stored in FASTQ
format. The clean reads were mapped to the reference genome using HISAT2 (v2.0.4).
Bowtie2 (v2.2.5) [3] was applied to align the clean reads to the reference coding gene set，
then expression level of gene was calculated by RSEM (v1.2.12). The heatmap was drawn by
pheatmap (v1.0.8) according to the gene expression in different samples. Essentially,
differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 (v1.4.5) with Q value ≤
0.05. To take insight to the change of phenotype, GO (http://www.geneontology.org/) and
KEGG (https://www.kegg.jp/) enrichment analysis of annotated different expressed gene was
performed by Phyper (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution) based on
Hypergeometric test. The significant levels of terms and pathways were corrected by Q value
with a rigorous threshold (Q value ≤ 0.05) by Bonferroni.
8. Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means ± SD unless otherwise indicated. Statistical analysis was
performed using GraphPad Prism Software Version 8.3 (GraphPad software, La Jolla, CA).
Results were evaluated by t-test or by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) when
appropriate. When multiple comparisons were made, a Bonferroni correction was performed
for each test. A P value less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
