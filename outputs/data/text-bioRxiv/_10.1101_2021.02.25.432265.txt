Abstract

Electron microscopy (EM) recordings of infected tissues serve to diagnose a disease, and
they can contribute to our understanding of infection processes. Consequently, a large
number of EM images of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 viruses with cells have been
made available by numerous labs. However, due to EM recording techniques at high
resolution, images of infection scenes are very noisy and they appear two dimensional
(‘flat’). Current research consequently aims (A) at methods that can remove noise, and
(B) at techniques that allow for recovering a 3D impression of the virus or its parts.
Here we discuss a novel method which can recover a spatial impression of a whole
infection scene at high resolution. In contrast to previous approaches which aim at the
reconstruction of single spike proteins or a single virus, the here used method can be
applied to a single noisy EM image of an infection scene. As one example image, we
show a high resolution image of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in Vero cell cultures (Fig. 1). The
method we use is based on probabilistic machine learning algorithms which can operate
in a ‘zero-shot’ setting, i.e., in a setting when just one noisy image (and no large and
clean image corpus) is available. The probabilistic method we apply can estimate nonnoisy images by inferring first order statistics (pixel means) across image patches using a
previously learned probabilistic image representation. Estimating higher order statistics
and appropriately chosen probabilistic models then allow for the generation of images
that enhance details and give a spatial impression of a full nanoscopic scene.

Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes the COVID-19 disease is currently infecting a high percentage of humans world-wide, which has dramatically impacted society and economy. Electron
microscopy (EM) imaging is an established method to visualize viruses and infection processes.
Such images can contribute to our understanding of how a given virus infects a cell, how it binds
to cells and different tissues, and how it spreads in the body (Lamers et al., 2020; Ivanova et al.,
2016, for two examples). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) allows for recordings of highresolution images on the scale of a few nanometers. However, for such high-resolution / low-light
conditions, EM images contain significant amounts of noise. Furthermore, images of viruses
and infection processes appear two dimensional (‘flat’) at this resolution (Fig. 2, top-left). In
order to address the problem of high noise, algorithms for noise removal have become a very
established tool, and they can significantly improve further image processing as well as the interpretation of images by humans. For images of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, a further goal has been
the reconstruction of the virus or virus parts in 3D from EM data. On the most detailed level,
work e.g. by Wrapp et al. (2020); Ke et al. (2020) has used large amounts of TEM images of
the SARS-CoV-2 particles in order to reconstruct the protein’s 3D shape on a molecular level.
It was thus possible to visualize a 3D model of the protein in different conditions which can
help to better understand the protein binding process. On the next lower resolution level, very
recent work by Nanographics GmbH has released a 3D image of the SARS-CoV-2 virus using
cryo-electron tomography (Nanographics, 2021; Yao et al., 2020). The approach is based on
a large number of TEM images of the same virus recorded as the sample is tilted along an
axis. These images are then merged to a 3D image using technology developed for computer
tomography (compare, e.g., Doerr, 2017).
Here, we consider a method that can operate on a single TEM image, i.e., a method that
neither requires the processing of a large number of different images of different spike proteins
(such as Wrapp et al., 2020; Ke et al., 2020) nor the processing of many images of the same virus
(as Nanographics, 2021). Instead, we consider a method that can be applied to a single noisy

TEM image in order to enhance the image. We use so-called probabilistic generative models
to first learn an image representation. If only the noisy image itself is available for learning,
the image processing task is commonly referred to as a ‘zero-shot’ task (compare, e.g., Shocher
et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020; Soh et al., 2020). The ‘zero-shot’ setting is often considered as
the most challenging setting. Representations based on single images often have the advantage,
however, that the intrinsic image statistics contains higher quality information than statistics
learned from large image corpora (e.g. Shocher et al., 2018, for a recent discussion). Once our
method has learned a representation for a noisy TEM image of a nano-scale infection scene,
we use this representation for two tasks: (A) for standard image denoising, and (B) for the
generation of images which can recover a spatial impression of the originally ‘flat’ appearing
image.

Results
As main example image for our method we used a freely available transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in Vero cell cultures (Laue et al., 2020, 2021).
The original image was recorded with 1376 x 1032 pixels with a pixel edge length corresponding
to 0.54 nm. From this image, we cropped a section of 1016 × 1032 pixels containing SARSCoV-2 viruses and parts of a Vero cell. In a further preprocessing step we scaled this cropped
image to a size of 508 × 516 by omitting every second pixel from the width and the height of the
image. This interpolation step was performed in order to reduce the computational demand
and at the same time not to change the image statistics. Fig. 2 (top left) shows this image.
Fig. 2 (top middle) shows the result of a ‘zero-shot’ denoising algorithm applied to the
original image of Fig. 2 (top left). We used a linear generative model with spike-and-slab prior
(Yoshida and West, 2010; Goodfellow et al., 2013; Sheikh et al., 2014; Drefs et al., 2020) which
learns a representation from 6 × 6 patches of the noisy TEM image. The model can then infer
the most likely underling non-noisy image. Training and inference is based on recent truncated
variational optimization (Guiraud et al., 2018; Drefs et al., 2020) with details given in the
Methods section below. To generate the denoised image, our approach estimates the mean of
each pixel (i.e., statistically the first moment). If we instead use the learned representation
to compute the variance of each pixel’s mean estimation (i.e., a higher order reconstruction
statistics), we obtain the image shown in Fig. 2 (top right). Displaying the variance of pixel
estimation removes the direct information on matter density from the TEM image. Information
about boundaries between high and low density matter is maintained because at boundaries,
image shapes vary more strongly than in volumes with uniform matter distribution. The
visualization of pixel variance based on a sufficiently sophisticated statistical model of image
patches in Fig. 2 (top right) recovers a spatial impression of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses and of the
whole infection scene. The introductory figure (Fig. 1) is based on Fig. 2 (top right) but was
manually colored (structures that we manually identified as belonging to the cell were colored
in blue, the remainder was colorized in yellow).
The same image we also processed using alternative probabilistic models. For instance,
Fig. 3 uses a Gamma-Poisson mixture model (Monk et al., 2018) instead of the spike-and-slab
linear model used for Figs. 1-2 (see Methods and caption of Fig. 3 for details). As can be
observed, the model itself changes the spatial appearance and (to a lesser extend) also the appearance of the conventionally denoised image (compare Fig. 3 (left) with Fig. 2 (top middle)).
Also the hyper-parameters which are used for the respective model change denoised image and
corresponding spatial representation (see Fig. 4 for examples and Methods for details). We
found that models which provide an explicit probabilistic distribution for image patches are
important for our purposes, while, for instance, non-local image processing methods such as
the BM3D baseline are less suitable, particularly when hyperparameters that require a priori

learned representation to probabilistically reconstruct each EM image patch. Finally, we generate reconstructed EM images (top center and right) by computing means and variances of the

We provide further results with different models and settings and for different images: Fig.

Fig. 7 shows an image of SARS-CoV-1 viruses (the virus that caused the outbreak of the SARS
disease in 2002/2003).

Methods
The foundation of the investigated EM image enhancement approach is learning data representations from EM images of SARS-CoV-2 viruses using probabilistic generative models. Here,
we apply spike-and-slab sparse coding (SSSC; Sheikh et al., 2014; Drefs et al., 2020) and a
Gamma-Poisson Mixture model (GPMM; Monk et al., 2018) as examples of latent variable
models with single and multiple causes. SSSC is a linear sparse coding model with binary-

point-wise multiplication, such that the resulting value has a spike-and-slab distribution, i.e.
it is either equal to zero if sh = 0 or continuously (normal) distributed otherwise. Given the

The likelihood is usually difficult to optimize directly, we therefore instead apply a variational
Expectation Maximization approach (Saul and Jordan, 1996; Neal and Hinton, 1998) and
optimize a variational lower bound F(q, Θ) ≤ L(Θ) of the log-likelihood (the variational lower
bound is also known as free energy or evidence lower bound). F(q, Θ) is optimized alternately
w.r.t. the so-called variational distributions q and the model parameters Θ. As implied by the
inequality, changes of the model parameters that lead to increases of the free energy also lead
to increases of the log-likelihood. For GPMMs, we leverage theoretical results from Monk et al.
(2018) and replace q by the exact posterior distribution of the model. For SSSC, on the other
hand, computing exact posteriors is intractable and we instead apply a variational Expectation
Maximization algorithm based on truncated posteriors (compare Drefs et al., 2020, and also
see Sheikh et al., 2014).
Having inferred optimal model parameters, we can use the learned data representation in
order to reconstruct the dataset, i.e. the given set of EM image patches. To this end, we apply a
probabilistic data estimator derived based on the posterior predictive distribution p(~
y est |~
y , Θ).

Discussion
When being produced at the limit of the possible resolution, electron microscopy (EM) images are typically contaminated by strong noise. If only noisy images are available, current
mainstream approaches for denoising such as feed-forward neural networks (DNNs) can not be
used because they require large datasets of pairs of clean and noisy images (e.g., Zhang et al.,
2017; Tai et al., 2017; Dong et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020). For high resolution EM images,
alternative approaches are consequently required.

Figure 7: ‘Zero-Shot’ Enhancements of Electron Microscopy Images of SARS-CoV-1 viruses
using SSSC trained on 9 × 9 EM image patches (see Methods for details). The noisy input
was obtained based on a freely available image by Gelderblom et al.. We converted the image
provided by Gelderblom et al. to grayscale, cropped a section showing four viruses and scaled
the resulting image to a size of 379 × 305 pixels using the same procedure as described above
(see Results for details).

Here, we investigated probabilistic generative approaches which can directly learn representations from noisy images. Such approaches are by definition unsupervised and typically
require much fewer data to learn appropriate representations. For the enhancement of EM images as considered here, noisy data in the form of patches extracted from a single EM image of
an infection scene proved sufficient. For standard image denoising and inpainting benchmarks,
recent work (Guiraud et al., 2020; Drefs et al., 2020) has shown that in the ‘zero-shot’ setting,
generative approaches can represent state-of-the-art algorithms, i.e., they can achieve higher
peak-signal-to-noise-ratios (PSNRs) than recent alternatives such as Noise2Void (Krull et al.,
2019) or Deep Image Prior (Ulyanov et al., 2018). Visual inspection of the here shown denoised
EM images confirms the benchmarking results of previous work, although a standard benchmarking is not available for the task here considered: to compute PSNR values for comparison,
clean ground-truth data would be required. However, visual inspection of the here obtained denoising results (for instance Fig. 2) strongly suggests that the competitive performance carries
over and shows effectively suppressing noise in high-resolution EM recordings.
In addition to the estimation of denoised images, we have here investigated higher-order
reconstruction statistics. Using the variances of pixel estimations, images can be computed
which recover a spatial impression of the corresponding infection scene. As for the conventionally denoised images, we computed the spatially appearing images based on a single, noisy
TEM image of the scene. This stands in contrast to the procedure that Nanographics (2021)
have applied to produce 3D reconstructions of a single SARS-CoV-2 virus. On the one hand,
such a tomogram reconstruction of the virus is more detailed and can nicely visualize the spike
protein structure and distribution on the virus’ surface. On the other hand, the method relies on many TEM images of the same single virus, and many images are more difficult to
obtain than single images. Furthermore, whole infection scenes are more challenging to reconstruct than a single virus, and 3D tomogram reconstructions of whole such scenes have (to our
knowledge) not been reported so far. Importantly, different approaches for 3D reconstruction
come with different artifacts. Tomogram approaches can misestimate surfaces especially for
noisy data, while our reconstructions based on generative models can introduce artifacts, e.g.,
because rare structures are underrepresented. Furthermore, due to being single-image based,
actual surfaces are not estimated by our approach. An advantage is that surface structures do
not occlude other structures – the here shown images have a ‘glassy’ effect. A disadvantage
is that, e.g., internal structures of the virus can get entangled with surface structures. To

identify single spikes across the whole surface of the virus, the 3D reconstruction method of
Nanographics (2021) is consequently preferable. In general, however, as artifacts are different
for the different approaches, the methods can be used to mutually confirm the true nano-scale
structures that are visualized. Furthermore, different methods can potentially be combined
in hybrid systems. For instance, ‘zero-shot’ denoising of single images by generative models
could be used to generate denoised images for improved 3D surface reconstruction with methods used by Nanographics (2021); or ‘zero-shot’ denoising could be used in conjunction with
other EM imaging methods (e.g. Titze and Genoud, 2016). Finally, different approaches are
applicable to different types of available data. The method for protein reconstruction (e.g.
Wrapp et al., 2020; Ke et al., 2020) combines TEM images of many protein molecules of many
different viruses, which neither the tomogram method of Nanographics (2021) nor our approach
is capable of. Also, unlike the surface reconstruction by Nanographics (2021), our approach
can not combine many TEM images of the same virus to generate a 3D tomogram. However,
neither the method of Wrapp et al. (2020); Ke et al. (2020) nor of Nanographics (2021) can
be used to recover a spatial impression from a single noisy TEM image. The here presented
method is consequently able to recover images giving a spatial impression of whole infection
scenes that can enhance small details. Images showing virus infections spatially have been
made available previously, e.g., by using scanning electron microscopes (see e.g. NIAID, 2020,
for examples). Such spatial images are at a lower resolution, however, and do therefore not
show the characteristic details of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, for instance. In contrast, we here show
images the give a spatial impression of whole infection scenes at very high resolution. To our
knowledge, these are the first images at such a level of detail and the first for a SARS-CoV-2
infection scene. Future work could, for instance, compare different EM recordings of the same
images of SARS-CoV-2 infection scenes (as well as other scenes). Such comparisons would help
in better understanding the ‘glassy’ effect we observe, and how internal and external structures
of the virus get entangeled using our approach.
In general, beyond their ability to provide more details, we believe that the here shown
images with their easy to identify corona viruses can more plastically and more directly communicate the threat posed by the virus. In turn, it may contribute to the motivation of each
individual to help battling the COVID-19 pandemic.
