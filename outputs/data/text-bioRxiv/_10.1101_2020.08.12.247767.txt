Abstract

27

Melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA5) acts as a cytoplasmic RNA sensor to detect viral

28

dsRNA and mediates type I interferon (IFN) signaling and antiviral innate immune responses to infection by

29

RNA viruses. Upon recognition of viral dsRNA, MDA5 is activated with K63-linked polyubiquitination and then

30

triggers the recruitment of MAVS and activation of TBK1 and IKK, subsequently leading to IRF3 and NF-κB

31

phosphorylation. Great numbers of symptomatic and severe infections of SARS-CoV-2 are spreading

32

worldwide, and the poor efficacy of treatment with type I interferon and antiviral agents indicates that SARS-

33

CoV-2 escapes from antiviral immune responses via an unknown mechanism. Here, we report that SARS-

34

CoV-2 nonstructural protein 8 (NSP8) acts as an innate immune suppressor and inhibits type I IFN signaling

35

to promote infection of RNA viruses. It downregulates the expression of type I IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes and

36

proinflammatory cytokines by binding to MDA5 and impairing its K63-linked polyubiquitination. Our findings

37

reveal that NSP8 mediates innate immune evasion during SARS-CoV-2 infection and may serve as a potential

38

target for future therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infectious diseases.

Importance

42

The large-scale spread of COVID-19 is causing mass casualties worldwide, and the failure of antiviral

43

immune treatment suggests immune evasion. It has been reported that several nonstructural proteins of

44

severe coronaviruses suppress antiviral immune responses; however, the immune suppression mechanism

45

of SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. Here, we revealed that NSP8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 directly blocks the

46

activation of the cytosolic viral dsRNA sensor MDA5 and significantly downregulates antiviral immune

47

responses. Our study contributes to our understanding of the direct immune evasion mechanism of SARS-

48

CoV-2 by showing that NSP8 suppresses the most upstream sensor of innate immune responses involved in

49

the recognition of viral dsRNA.

Introduction

54

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging severe coronavirus that is

55

currently causing a global outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). It has infected more than twenty

56

million patients and caused more than two-thirds of a million deaths. The number of patients and deaths are

57

still rapidly increasing; however, no effective therapy, vaccine or cure are available. Knowledge of SARS-CoV-

58

2 infection, pathogenesis, diseases and treatments remains limited, and novel targets of therapeutics and

59

drug development are quite urgently needed.

60

Analysis of clinical data from different SARS-CoV-2 patients has shown that excessive cytokine release,

61

known as a “cytokine storm”, is closely related to disease severity

62

inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients, genome-wide RNA-sequencing analysis was performed, which

63

indicated that the proportion of immune cells in the blood was reduced in patients who required non-ICU

64

admission, with lower levels of GCSF, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL2/MCP-1 and CCL3/MIP-1A detected. In addition,

65

some anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-β, were found to be induced during SARS-CoV-2

66

infection 4. Accordingly, compared with ICU care patients, non-ICU care patients had lower plasma levels of

67

cytokines, including IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα. Furthermore, mild cases of

68

COVID-19 exhibited decreased plasma levels of IL2R and IL6 compared with severe cases, while an

69

excessive inflammatory response was observed in dead cases

70

between the release of inflammatory cytokines and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.

To characterize the host immune and

These studies reported a correlation

71

SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses generate massive amounts of RNA products during their infection

72

that are then recognized by host cytosolic RNA sensors, including retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and

73

melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA5) 7. Activation of RIG-I and MDA5 triggers the formation of

74

signalosomes that induce the expression of type I IFN and ISGs and the subsequent execution of an antiviral

75

state within the cell 8. To escape immune elimination and to survive and then replicate, coronaviruses, including

76

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have evolved strategies to inhibit or delay IFN production and responses. SARS-

77

CoV encodes a set of accessory proteins, several of which target the innate immune response. Its

78

nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) binds to the 40S ribosome to inactivate translation and induces host mRNA

85

Considering the numerous existing asymptomatic infected populations, it is reasonable to suggest that

86

SARS-CoV-2 has evolved effective strategies to inhibit the host immune response, which is also a challenge

87

for preventing and treating COVID-19. Consistent with these observations, a recent study showed that NSP1

88

of SARS-CoV-2 shuts down host mRNA translation by binding to 40S and 80S ribosomes, effectively blocking

89

RIG-I-dependent innate immune responses 19. However, the potential immune inhibitory mechanism mediated

90

by viral components of SARS-CoV-2 is not well known.

91

We performed a systematic screening and determined that SARS-CoV-2 NSP8 is a suppressor of the type

92

I immune response upon RNA viral infection. It decreases type I IFN production and ISG expression, by which

93

it interacts with the MDA5 CARD domain and then inhibits MDA5 K63-linked polyubiquitination and thus

94

terminates MDA5-mediated immune responses.

96

Results

97

NSP8 inhibits viral RNA-related type I interferon and antiviral responses.

98

To investigate a factor of SARS-CoV-2 that suppresses the type I IFN signaling pathway, we screened a

99

panel of viral nonstructural proteins (NSPs) that regulate the expression of interferon and inflammatory factors

100

using RT-PCR arrays. 293T cells were transfected with empty vector or NSP-expressing plasmids for 24 h.

101

The cells were left untreated or challenged with dsRNA analog poly(I:C) for 18 h or 24 h separately and then

102

harvested for analysis of gene expression. Several NSPs exhibited the inhibitory effects on immune and

103

inflammatory gene expression (Supplementary Fig.1). We found that NSP8 significantly downregulated the

104

expression of TNF-α, IFN-β, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) IFIT1 and IFIT2 and proinflammatory

105

cytokines IL-6 and CCL-20 (Fig.1a). Consistent with our results, NSP1 was previously reported to inhibit the

106

translation of type I interferon to evade the immune response, which validated our screening approach 9,19.

107

To confirm that the attenuation of the type I IFN response by NSP8 is correlated with a decrease in the

108

antiviral response, NSP8-overexpressing 293T cells were subsequently infected with vesicular stomatitis virus

109

tagged with enhanced GFP (VSV-eGFP). As analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, NSP8

110

overexpression increased the percentage of GFP-positive cells with the extended response time compared

111

with empty vector-transfected cells (Fig.1b,c), suggesting that NSP8 promoted the efficiency of viral infection

112

and gene expression, hence favoring VSV-eGFP replication. These data demonstrated that NSP8 is an

113

inhibitory protein in type I IFN signaling and antiviral responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

114
115

NSP8 decreases MAVS-dependent antiviral responses.

116

To further understand whether the inhibitory effects of NSP8 are exerted on both the IRF3 and NF-κB

117

pathways, 293T cells were cotransfected with empty vector or IRF3 or p65 expressing plasmid and with NSP8-

118

expressing plasmid, followed by VSV infection for the indicated time points. By immunoblotting analysis to

119

detect the effect of NSP8 on the phosphorylation of TBK1 (pTBK1), the phosphorylation of IRF3 (pIRF3)

120

(Fig.2a), the phosphorylation of IKKα/β (pIKKα/β), the phosphorylation of p65 (p-p65) and IκBα (Fig.2b), we

121

found that in NSP8-overexpressing cells, pTBK1 level was four- to nine-fold lower than that in control cells

122

after VSV infection. As a downstream transcription factor that is phosphorylated and activated by TBK1, IRF3

123

phosphorylation was entirely blocked in NSP8-overexpressing cells (Fig.2a). Similarly, inhibition of IKKα/β

124

phosphorylation by NSP8 led to the stabilization of IκBα, and NF-κB signaling was strongly inhibited by NSP8

125

overexpression, as indicated by the decrease in p65 phosphorylation (Fig.2b). These results confirm that

126

NSP8 suppresses the activation of both IRF3 and NFκB and the upstream cascade of the type I IFN signaling

127

pathway.

128

To investigate whether NSP8 plays a role in the early step of the type I IFN signaling cascade, we detected

129

the inhibitory effect of NSP8 in MAVS-deficient vs. complemented cells. MAVS knockout HEK293T cells

130

(HEK293TMAVS-/-) were cotransfected with NSP8-expressing plasmid or empty vector and with MAVS-

131

expressing plasmid or empty vector and then stimulated with poly(I:C) for different times. As expected, the

132

expression of TNF-α, IFN-β, IFIT1, IFIT2, IL-6 and CCL-20 was not downregulated by NSP8 upon stimulation

133

(Fig.2c, black vs. white columns), while MAVS overexpression in HEK293TMAVS-/- cells significantly restored

134

their induction upon stimulation, and NSP8 once again had suppressive effects on the expression of these

135

cytokines (Fig.2c, red vs. blue columns). Taken together, these results suggest that NSP8 suppresses MAVS-

136

dependent innate immune responses, probably by acting on either MAVS or upstream RNA sensors.

137
138

NSP8 interacts with MDA5 and suppresses MDA5 K63-linked polyubiquitination

139

Since viral RNA of coronaviruses contains a methylated 5’-cap and 3’-polyA tail that is similar to cellular

140

mRNA, we assumed that NSP8 may preferentially regulate MDA5-mediated responses rather than RIG-I-

141

mediated responses that recognize 5’-pppRNA. Hence, we performed coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) analysis

142

and found that NSP8 interacts with MDA5 (Fig.3a). Furthermore, we mapped the binding domain and

143

determined that its CARD domain is responsible for the NSP8 interaction (Fig.3b). As a result, MDA5-mediated

144

ISRE-luc activity was inhibited by NSP8 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3c). In addition, confocal

145

microscopy demonstrated that NSP8 tightly colocalized with MDA5 inside cells (Fig.3d). These results suggest

146

that NSP8 interacts with MDA5 and directly suppresses MDA5-mediated immune responses.

147

To further understand the molecular mechanism by which NSP8 interacts and interferes with MDA5, we

148

predicted the MDA5 CARD, NSP8 and K63-Ub tertiary structures with SWISS-MODEL, and then the predicted

149

structures were input into ZDOCK SERVER for simulation. Predicted docking models were processed in

150

PyMOL for visualization. Surprisingly, we found that NSP8 possesses a long α-helix (Supplementary Fig.2a),

151

which is tightly packed in the ravines formed by the two α-helixes of MDA5 CARDs. The random coil and a

152

short α-helix in the N terminus of NSP8 occupy the area or space that interacts with K63-Ub (Fig.3e and

153

Supplementary Fig.2b). Further calculation of vacuum electrostatics for this binding model demonstrated that

154

the contact area in the chain of MDA5 CARDs is positively charged, while the corresponding area in the chain

155

of NSP8 is negatively charged (Fig.3f and Supplementary Fig.2c), implying that there is a likely interaction of

156

these two structures. We further searched the polar contacts in the interface of the binding model with PyMOL

157

and found that 7 paired residues anchor with each other, one locates in the N-terminal coil of NSP8 while the

158

others are in the long α-helix (Fig.3g).Thus, computer-based molecular structural prediction and modeling

159

implies that NSP8 interacts with the MDA5 CARD domain probably through ionic interactions and dipolar

160

surfaces between the NSP8 and MDA5 CARD binding pockets.

161

Next, we sought to determine how NSP8 inhibits MDA5 activation. It is well documented that upon virus

162

infection, the MDA5 CARD domain undergoes K63-linked polyubiquitination and recruits MAVS to form a

163

signalosome

164

interrupt this process since it interacts with MDA5 at its CARD domain and shields the binding area or space

165

for K63-ubiquitin linkage (Fig.3e, Supplementary Fig.2, and pdb file). The polyubiquitination of MDA5 was

166

analyzed in the presence or absence of NSP8 expression. The MDA5-expressing plasmid was cotransfected

167

into HEK293T cells with a WT-, K48-, or K63-linked ubiquitin-expressing plasmid, and an in vivo ubiquitination

168

assay showed that MDA5 WT- and K63-linked polyubiquitination were strongly inhibited (Fig.4a,c), while K48-

169

linked polyubiquitination was barely affected (Fig.4b). Thus, these results reveal that NSP8 interferes with the

170

MDA5-MAVS signalosome by inhibiting the K63-linked polyubiquitination of MDA5.

20

. The structural prediction of the NSP8-MDA5 CARD interaction showed that NSP8 may

171
172

NSP8 decreases the expression of antiviral immune and inflammatory genes.

173

Next, we investigated whether NSP8 affects the downstream expression of immune and inflammatory genes

174

and cytokines. NSP8-expressing A549 cells were collected, and total RNA was subjected to RT-PCR array

175

analysis for immune and inflammatory gene expression (Primer listed in Supplementary Table.1). The

176

expression of the majority of cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-26, IL-33, IFN-β, IFIT1 and IFIT2,

177

was downregulated by NSP8 expression. The transcription of some pleiotropic chemoattractant cytokines,

178

such as IL-16, IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL17C, was also downregulated. Furthermore, a decreasing transcription

179

tendency was also observed for the inflammatory receptors IL-1RI, IL-1RII, IL-2Rα, and IL18RII; NK cell-

180

associated activation receptors, such as NKp44, NKp46, and NKG2B; and the trans-acting T-cell-specific

181

transcription factor GATA3 (Fig.5a), indicating that the activation of T cells and NK cells was attenuated by

182

NSP8 through the suppression of these key factors. Although these decreased cytokines and receptors may

183

not be directly activated by IRF3 or NFκB, they could be regulated by downstream cytokines or other factors

184

derived from these two pathways. In contrast, the cytokine IL-2 and IFN-gamma suppression gene FOXP3

185

was significantly increased with NSP8 overexpression.

186

To further confirm that the downregulation of these immune and inflammatory cytokines and genes is

187

mediated by NSP8 under physiological conditions, A549 cells were transfected with an NSP8-expressing

7

188

plasmid or empty vector and then stimulated with poly(I:C) mimicking viral RNA for the indicated times. The

189

inhibition of the expression of key cytokines and related genes was verified, and NSP8 negatively regulated

190

the expression of these immune and inflammatory genes (Fig.5b). Collectively, these results suggest that

191

NSP8 could strongly impair the expression of genes involved in antiviral immune and inflammatory responses.

192
193

Discussion

194

It has not been well investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 components have immunosuppressive functions, so

195

we are very interested in exploring the roles of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, especially the nonstructural protein

196

family (NSP), in viral immune evasion. In the present study, we screened a panel of NSPs and identified NSP8

197

as an immune suppressor of the type I IFN signaling pathway. We have shown that NSP8 overexpression

198

impaired type I IFN production and the gene expression of immune and inflammatory factors, including TNF-

199

α, IFN-β, IFIT1, IFIT2, IL-6 and CCL-20. As a consequence, we observed that VSV-eGFP infection was

200

significantly increased in cells with NSP8 overexpression. The subsequent detection of phosphorylation of

201

kinases TBK1 and IKKα/β and substrates IRF3 and p65 provided evidence that both IRF3 and NFκB activity

202

were inhibited by NSP8. MAVS is an upstream regulator of the type I IFN signaling cascade and regulates

203

both pathways; hence, we overexpressed NSP8 in MAVS knockout HEK293T cells and observed that the

204

inhibitory function of NSP8 towards type I IFN and cytokines was completely abolished. Re-expressing MAVS

205

in MAVS KO HEK293T cells that also express NSP8 successfully restored the NSP8 inhibitory activity.

206

Consequently, a series of antiviral immune and inflammatory cytokines and related genes were further strongly

207

downregulated by NSP8 expression.

208

Herein, we speculated that NSP8 may act on RIG-I or MDA5, two upstream viral RNA sensors. Our results

209

showed that NSP8 directly interacted with MDA5 on its CARD domains, and MDA5-mediated type I IFN

210

signaling activities were strongly inhibited at the same time. Polyubiquitinated modification of MDA5 is crucial

211

for its antiviral responses, K48-linked polyubiquitination mediates MDA5 proteasomal degradation 21, and K63-

212

linked polyubiquitination mediates MDA5-induced type I IFN expression

213

inhibit type I IFN signaling through the polyubiquitinated modification of MDA5. To test our hypothesis, we

214

determined the status of WT-, K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitination of MDA5 in the absence or presence of

8

20.

We speculated that NSP8 may

215

NSP8 and confirmed that WT- and K63-linked polyubiquitination were impaired by NSP8, while K48-linked

216

polyubiquitination was barely changed. We therefore conclude that under certain circumstances, NSP8

217

jeopardizes antiviral responses by impairing MDA5 K63-linked polyubiquitination.

218

Based on our existing experimental data, we propose a simple working model to illustrate how NSP8

219

negatively regulates innate immune responses by inhibiting MDA5 K63-linked polyubiquitination (Fig.5c).

220

Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, cytosolic viral dsRNA is recognized by MDA5 and triggers type I IFN expression;

221

meanwhile, NSP8 is largely expressed and localized in the cytoplasm of host cells and then interacts with

222

MDA5 on its CARD domains to inhibit its K63-linked polyubiquitination, consequently negatively regulating

223

type I IFN signaling and antiviral immune responses, thus favoring viral infection and replication.

224

Interestingly, a recent study showed that in the carrier and intermediate host of coronaviruses—pangolin—

225

the MDA5 gene is mutated and dysfunctional 22, while RIG-I and TLR 3, 7 and 8 are conserved among three

226

different species. Considering the coexisting relationship between pangolins and coronaviruses and the

227

tolerance of pangolins for SARS-CoV-2 infection, this finding implied that coronaviruses may be inclined to

228

silence MDA5-mediated innate immunity because they could generate more drastic reactivity and injury upon

229

viral RNA recognition. Based on this observation and the findings of our present study, the suppressive

230

function of NSP8 in antiviral responses and its impairment of MDA5 activation have been identified,

231

representing a direct immune evasion mechanism of the recognition of viral dsRNA.

232

Multiple posttranslational

233

polyubiquitination, are employed to regulate the antiviral signalosome

234

polyubiquitination is commonly used for the degradation or activation of MDA5 and RIG-I. The E3 ubiquitin

235

ligase TRIM40 targets MDA5 and RIG-I to promote their K27- and K48-linked ubiquitination, thus leading to

236

their proteasomal degradation for immune silencing, but upon RNA virus infection, TRIM40 is downregulated

237

to allow the activation of a sufficient antiviral immune response

238

Epstein-Barr virus protein BPLF1, which has ubiquitin- and NEDD8-specific deconjugase activity, interact with

239

scaffold proteins 14-3-3 and TRIM25 to form a tri-molecular complex, consequently promoting the dimerization

240

and ubiquitination of TRIM25. Consequently, K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I is downregulated, leading

241

to the attenuation of RIG-I-mediated type I IFN antiviral responses 24. In addition, the NS3 protein of ZIKA virus

242

interacts with scaffold proteins 14-3-3ϵ and η separately through its 14-3-3 binding motif, hence blocking the

243

translocation of RIG-I and MDA5 from the cytosol to mitochondria, impairing signalosome formation with MAVS,

244

and antagonizing innate immunity 25. Our studies revealed that NSP8 of SARS-CoV-2 acts as a binding partner

245

of MDA5 to shield its K63-linked polyubiquitination and then impairs the formation or activation of the MDA5

246

signalosome.

247

In summary, our study provides insights into the potential mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 NSP8 in the

248

inhibition of type I IFN signaling and antiviral responses. We provide compelling evidence that NSP8 plays a

249

critical negative role in MDA5-mediated antiviral responses and demonstrate specific orchestration of the viral

250

dsRNA-triggered signalosome and signal cascade by NSP8. Importantly, considering that MDA5 plays a key

251

pathological role in antiviral immunity towards severe coronaviruses, antagonists of NSP8 could serve as a

252

promising therapeutic target for COVID-19 therapies.

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis

309

For immunoprecipitation, whole cell extracts were prepared after transfection or stimulation with appropriate

310

ligands, followed by incubation for 1 h at 4°C with anti-GFP agarose beads (AlpaLife). Beads were washed 4

311

times with low-salt lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitants were eluted with 2x SDS loading buffer and then

312

resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore) and further incubated with

313

the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. The images were visualized using Odyssey Sa (LI-COR).

28

317

was input into ZDOCK-SERVER

as a receptor, while NSP8 or K63-Ub was input as a ligand for docking

318

computation. MDA5-CARDs with NSP8.pdb and MDA5-CARDs with K63-Ub.pdb were the best fit prediction

319
