Abstract
Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) manifests lung pathology that resembles human COVID-19
patients. In this study, efforts were made to check the infectivity of a local SARS-CoV-2
isolate in hamster model and evaluate the differential expression of lung proteins during acute
infection and convalescence. The findings of this study confirm the infectivity of this isolate
in vivo. Analysis of clinical parameters and tissue samples shows a similar type of
pathophysiological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection as reported earlier in COVID-19
patients and hamsters infected with other isolates. The lung-associated pathological changes
were very prominent on the 4th day post-infection (dpi), mostly resolved by 14dpi. Here, we
carried out quantitative proteomic analysis of the lung tissues from SARS-CoV-2-infected
hamsters at day 4 and day 14 post infection. This resulted in the identification of 1,585
differentially expressed proteins of which 68 proteins were significantly altered among both
the infected groups. Pathway analysis revealed complement and coagulation cascade, platelet
activation, ferroptosis and focal adhesion as the top enriched pathways. In addition, we also
identified altered expression of two pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins (Sftpd and
Sftpb), known for their protective role in lung function. Together, these findings will aid in
the identification of candidate biomarkers and understanding the mechanism(s) involved in
SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

Introduction
The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has
emerged as a global public health crisis affecting millions of people worldwide. SARS-CoV2, the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), primarily infects the
respiratory tract resulting in respiratory failure consistent with the acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS). The aggressive inflammatory response associated with infection leads to
tissue damage and fatal lung injury. The death of the virus affected epithelial cells and
endothelial cells, and activation of resident dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages
result in enhanced production of cytokines and chemokines (cytokine storm). This triggers
further activation and recruitment of immune cells leading to tissue damage and exacerbation
of respiratory distress and disease severity. Severe clinical manifestations involving multiorgan failure have resulted in high morbidity and mortality, thus demanding immediate
therapeutic measures and disease management. In this regard, a better understanding of viral
and host factors involved in this disease's pathogenesis has paramount significance. After
identifying the SARS-CoV-2 virus, multiple genomic and proteomics-based approaches have
been adapted to understand the host response to this viral infection. In the recent past,
different studies have been conducted using proteomics technology to understand the virushost protein interactome, changes in host protein expression upon virus infection, and for
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most of these studies have been carried out with
patients’ liquid specimens like serum, plasma, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage [1-5].
Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are primarily related to the lung; hence clinical
proteomics of infected lung tissues are essential to understand and combat this disease. The
information obtained from such studies will provide the rationale for designing novel
diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Moreover, the identification of differentially
expressed proteins signature can serve as markers of COVID-19 disease severity, which will
be highly useful for better disease management.
Preclinical animal models that recapitulate multiple sequential events associated with human
diseases are precious tools to understand the mechanistic aspects of human disease
progression. In human patients, the COVID-19 associated lung pathology is a major clinical
concern [6, 7]. The manifestation of similar pulmonary damages in hamsters infected with
SARS-CoV-2 virus has emphasized this model's relevance [8-12]. Further characterization of
this model is essential for the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines against this

virus. An in-depth understanding of host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters will
elucidate this model's similarity or dissimilarity with human patients. Although efforts have
been made to identify differentially expressed proteins in diverse body fluids of COVID-19
patients; there is a dearth of evidence related to differentially expressed proteins in human
lung tissues at acute and convalescence stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fresh lung tissues
of COVID-19 patients during infection or recovery are ethically impossible to obtain. Hence,
so far, data obtained from tissues of deceased COVID-19 patients are only available. In this
regard, tissues obtained from animals infected with SARS-CoV-2 at different viral infection
stages will prove beneficial. In this study, efforts have been made to quantitatively compare
host protein levels in lung tissues of hamsters at various stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The differentially expressed proteins identified in this study provide information of various
host proteins that might have a significant role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection
or disease manifestation. Some of the deregulated proteins identified in this study might be
validated in easily assessable body fluids as potential biomarkers for predicting the disease
course.

Materials and methods
Animal ethics
In this study, attempts were made to evaluate the infectivity of one of the local isolates of
SARS-CoV2 (NCBI accession ID- MW559533.2) in the Syrian Golden Hamster model. All
the experiments were done with prior approval of Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBSC)
and Institutional Animal Ethical Committee (IAEC). The study was carried out adhering to
the guidelines of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments
on Animals (CPCSEA), Govt. of India.
Animal studies
For this study, eleven hamsters of the age group 6-7 months were acclimated at the ILS
ABSL3 facility for 4-6 days prior to the experiments. As shown in the schematic (Figure
1A), on day zero, six animals were infected intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 (105 TCID50)
and five animals were mock-infected (only PBS) under intraperitoneal ketamine (200mg/kg)
and xylazine (10mg/kg) anaesthesia. The SARS-CoV-2 virus used in this study was isolated
from a clinically confirmed local COVID-19 patient (NCBI accession ID- MW559533.2).
Virus from the 10th passage was used for this animal challenge study. Out of the six infected
animals, three animals were sacrificed on 4dpi (day post-infection), and the other three were
sacrificed on 14dpi. Out of the five mock-infected animals, three were sacrificed on 4dpi, and
the other two were sacrificed on 14dpi. Throughout the experiment, all the animals were
monitored daily, and body weights were recorded on alternate days. On the day of sacrifice,
tissues from all the vital organs and other organs like the pancreas, spleen, and
gastrointestinal tracts were harvested, preserved, and further processed for histopathological
analysis and viral load estimation.
Sample collection, storage, and processing
Tissues harvested from different organs, including lungs, were divided into three parts. One
part was stored in buffered formalin and further processed for histopathological analysis. The
second part was immediately put into Trizol RNA isolation buffer, and the third part was
snap-frozen and stored at −80°C until further use. Formalin-fixed tissues were further
processed and sectioned for H&E, Immunohistochemistry (IHC), and Immunofluorescence
analysis (IF) as reported earlier [13].

Haemotoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining and lung pathology scoring
Multiple H&E stained lung sections for each animal were evaluated blindly, and based on the
extent of lung epithelial injury and inflammation, a lung pathology score was given for each
animal (Supplementary figure 1). The scoring was done on a scale of 0-10 based on the
severity of lung pathology.
Immunohistochemistry:
Collected tissues were processed and sectioned as reported previously [13, 14]. Sections were
deparaffinized, rehydrated, and subjected to antigen retrieval (Vector Laboratories) treatment
for 20 min followed by blocking the endogenous peroxidase with 3% hydrogen peroxide in
methanol for 20 min. Horse serum (Vector Laboratories) was used for blocking the sections
for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with Ki-67 antibody (#VP-RM04; Vector
Laboratories, 1:100) overnight at 4°C. Sections were washed twice with 1x PBS and treated
with biotinylated anti-rabbit/mouse IgG secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) for 45
minutes, followed by ABC reagent for 30 min. Diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories) was
used as a substrate to develop the stain. Hematoxylin was used as a counterstain followed by
dehydration with alcohol, clearing with xylene, and mounting with permanent mounting
media (Vector Laboratories). Stained sections were observed under the microscope (Leica
DM500), and images were taken at different magnifications.

Immunofluorescence
Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and subjected to antigen retrieval treatment and
serum blocking as reported earlier [13]. Sections were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 N
protein (Nucleocapsid) (#11-2003; Abgenex, 1:200) or SOD2/Mn-SOD (#NB100-1992;
Novus biologicals, 1:100) in a humidified chamber overnight at 4°C. Sections were washed
twice with PBST for 5 min each and incubated with anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (#A-11037;
Life technologies, 1:500) or anti-Mouse Alexa Fluor 594 (#A-11005; Life technologies,
1:500) for 45 min under dark conditions at room temperature. Sections were washed with
PBST twice and mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade reagent with DAPI (#P36935;
Invitrogen) and visualized using Leica TCS SP8STED confocal microscope.

Western blot analysis:
For Western blot analysis, cells were re-suspended in RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH
7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% TritonX-100)
containing the protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific). The whole-cell lysates (WCL)
were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Thermo
Scientific), followed by blocking and immunoblotting with antibodies specific for SARSCoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein (#11-2003, Abgenex) or β-actin (#4970, CST) [15].
qRT-PCR:
RNA isolation from culture supernatant was performed using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit
(#52906, Qiagen), and for hamster tissue samples, TRizol reagent (#10296010, Invitrogen)
was used. The isolated RNA was subjected to qRT-PCR for determining the viral load. We
performed one-step multiplex real-time PCR using TaqPathTM 1-Step Multiplex Master Mix
(#A28526, Thermo Fisher Scientific), targeting three different SARS-CoV-2 genes with
primer and probe sets specific for spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), and open reading frame 1
(ORF1). The standard curve for absolute quantification of viral genome copies was generated
using log-fold dilutions of plasmid pLVXEF1alpha-nCoV2019-N-2xStrep-IRES-Puro
plasmid harboring the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene [16].
Sample preparation for proteomics analysis
The lung tissue samples of SARS-CoV-2-infected on 4 and 14dpi along with mock-infected
(4dpi) were processed and homogenized using liquid nitrogen and lysed in lysis buffer
containing 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 50mM triethylammonium bicarbonate
(TEABC). The samples were subjected to sonication three times for 10 sec storing on ice to
prevent overheating between the sonication and was followed by heating at 90°C for 5 min.
The lysates were then incubated at room temperature for cooling and centrifuged at 12,000
rpm for 10 minutes. The protein concentration present in the supernatant was determined
using a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) kit (Thermo Scientific Pierce) and an equal amount
of protein from each group was pooled for further analysis. LC-MS/MS approach was used
using isotopomer labels, “tandem mass tags” (TMTs), to determine the relative quantification
of proteins [17].

In-solution digestion and TMT labeling
Protein lysate of 300 µg from pooled samples of each group was reduced by incubating in
10mM Dithiothreitol (DTT) at 60°C for 20 minutes. Alkylation was carried out in the dark
with 20 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) at room temperature for 10 minutes. The lysate was further
subjected to acetone precipitation, and the pellet was dissolved in 50mM TEABC. Digestion
was carried out at 37°C for 16 hours using trypsin (Sciex, #4326682) at a final concentration
of 1:20 (w/w). The reaction was acidified using 0.1% formic acid, and the peptides were
lyophilized and stored at -80°C until further use.
LC-MS/MS acquisition
The digested peptides were fractionated into six fractions using StageTip fractionation.
Fractionated peptides (6 fractions in triplicate, total 18 runs) were analyzed on Orbitrap
Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) interfaced
with Easy-nLC 1000 nanoflow liquid chromatography system (Thermo Scientific, Odense,
Southern Denmark). Each fraction was reconstituted in solvent A (0.1% formic acid) and
loaded onto trap column (75 µm x 2 cm) Thermo Scientific™ Acclaim™ PepMap™ 100 C18
(#164535; Thermo Scientific) (3 µm particle size, pore size 100Å) at a flow rate of 5 µl/min
with solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water).
The peptides were resolved on an analytical column (EASY-Spray™ C18 Reversed Phase
HPLC Column, 2 μm, 75 μm x 500 mm; Thermo Scientific) using a linear gradient of 7-30%
solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 95% acetonitrile) over 100 minutes at a flow rate of 300
nl/min. Data-dependent Mass Spectrometry acquisition was carried out at top speed mode
with full scans (350-1500 m/z) acquired using an Orbitrap mass analyzer at a mass resolution
of 120,000 at 200 m/z. For MS/MS, top intense precursor ions from a 3-second duty cycle
were selected and subjected to higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) with 35%
normalized collision energy. The fragment ions were detected at a mass resolution of 30,000
at m/z of 200. Dynamic exclusion was set for 30 seconds. Lock-mass from ambient air (m/z
445.1200025) was enabled for internal calibration as described previously [18].
Bioinformatics and statistical analysis
The Proteome Discoverer 2.3 (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) was used to carry out
protein identification and quantitation. All raw files were searched against a Mesocricetus

auratus (Syrian Golden hamster) protein database in Universal Proteins Resource
Knowledgebase (UniProt) (32,336 entries) supplemented with common contaminants (116
entries) using SequestHT as a search algorithm. The search parameters included trypsin as the
proteolytic enzyme with a maximum allowed missed cleavages to two. Oxidation of
methionine and acetylation of protein N-terminus were set as dynamic modifications. In
contrast, static modifications included cysteine carbamidomethylation and TMT modification
at N-terminus of the peptide and lysine residue. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm,
and fragment mass tolerance was set to 0.05 Da; all the PSMs were identified with 1% FDR.
The differential expression ratios between the groups were calculated. Proteins with
differential expression ratios ≥1.5 (upregulated) or ≤ 0.67 (downregulated) were considered
differentially expressed. The significance of differences between groups was calculated using
Student's t-test (two-tailed), and a p-value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Gene
Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) were performed using the EnrichR online tool http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/)
[19].
Principal component analysis was performed using sample-wise scaled unfiltered normalized
protein abundance data using PCAtools. Heatmaps were generated using protein-wise
scaled and filtered protein abundance (1.5 and 1.3 up- or down-regulation; p-value ≤0.05 in
any comparison) and k-means clustering (k=3).
Data availability
The raw data files and the MSF files were submitted to the PRIDE partner repository [20]
with dataset identifier PXD024547.

Results and discussion
Clinical features, viral load and histopathological changes in lungs
Studies using the hamster model of COVID-19 have shown differential infectivity of various
SARS-CoV-2 isolates indicating a possible role of viral factors in regulating disease
pathogenesis. To investigate the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, Syrian hamsters were
infected with the virus, and harvested tissue samples were collected at two different time
points (4 & 14dpi) for viral load and pathological analysis (Figure 1A). Corroborating earlier
reports, a significant weight loss was noticed in all the infected animals at 4dpi. On 4dpi all
the animals lost around 15% of their initial body weight (Figure 1B). After 6dpi the infected
animals started regaining their body weight. During the course of the experiments, no
mortality was found in both infected and mock-infected animals. At the time of organ
isolation, congestion of lungs was grossly visible only in infected animals at 4dpi (Figure
1C). Further histopathological analysis of the 4dpi SARS-CoV-2 infected tissue samples
showed the presence of severe pathological lesions in the lungs (Figure 1C). Multifocal
necrosis and the desquamation of bronchial epithelial cells and infiltration of inflammatory
cells were present in the SARS-CoV-2 infected lung tissues (Figure 1C). Around 50 % lung
area was affected in all the infected animals, and the lesions were patchy throughout the
lungs. Necrosuppurative bronchitis and interstitial pneumonia was evident in all the infected
animals at 4dpi (Supplementary figure 1D and 1E). Different areas of the infected lung
tissues showed consolidation of lungs and hemorrhage (Supplementary figure 1C). These
hamsters exhibited severe interstitial pneumonia, as evidenced by the thickening of the
alveolar wall, altered alveolar structure, and immune cells' infiltration (Supplementary
figure 1D). Endothelium near the damaged areas was reactive, as evidenced by mononuclear
cells' adhesion to the endothelium (Supplementary figure 1A). In certain instances, the
immune cells have invaded the vessel wall and caused endotheliitis (Supplementary figure
1B). In one of the infected animal (4dpi), visceral pleural invasion of immune cells was also
noticed (Supplementary figure 1F). However, no noticeable histopathological changes were
observed in mock-infected hamster lung at any time point. After 14dpi, hamsters infected
with SARS-CoV-2 exhibited only mild inflammatory infiltration and tissue damage
suggestive of resolution of disease manifestation (Figure 1C). Histopathological evaluation
of tracheal tissues from all the animals also showed a severe tracheal epithelial and
endothelial damage in 4dpi infected tissues compared to 14dpi infected or mock-infected

tissues (Supplementary figure 2). The significantly higher lung pathology score at 4dpi
infected tissues than 14dpi corroborates the earlier reports and indicates the self-limiting
nature of this disease in the hamster (Figure 1H).
Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of lung tissue sections with SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid (N) protein showed the viral antigen-positive bronchial and alveolar epithelial
cells at 4dpi, which were not detected at14dpi tissues (Figure 1D). Immunoblot analysis of
the lung tissue protein lysates also corroborated the IF findings (Figure 1E). The viral
genome copy number estimation showed the presence of viral genome in both 4dpi and 14dpi
infected lung tissues, however the copy number was significantly low in 14dpi tissues
compared to 4dpi tissues (Figure 1F). Immunohistochemical staining for Ki67, a marker of
cell proliferation, showed marked cellular proliferation (hyperplasia) of bronchial and
alveolar cells at 4dpi (Figure 1G). This finding corroborates with the earlier report [12].
Together, the findings from this study suggest pathophysiological manifestation of SARSCoV-2 infection similar to that observed in COVID-19 patients and hamsters infected with
other clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 [21, 22].
Quantitative proteomics analysis
Molecular alterations in pulmonary pathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection
Our data provides an in-depth proteome analysis of the SARS-CoV-2-infected hamster lungs
at 4dpi and 14dpi compared to mock-infected (4dpi). The quantitative proteomics data was
analyzed using high-resolution LC-MS/MS in triplicates where the raw files were searched
using Proteome Discoverer 2.3. The search resulted in the identification of 2,211 proteins (at
1% FDR) and 1,585 proteins were differentially expressed across all the samples. Of these,
50 and 18 proteins were dysregulated (cut off 1.5 fold, p≤0.05) at 4dpi and 14dpi,
respectively. A complete list of the proteins identified is provided in Supplementary Table
1. All the differentially expressed proteins were further represented as a heat map using
hierarchical clustering analysis comparing mock-infected with the infected samples (Figure
2A). Interestingly, the principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated distinct protein
expression patterns among the mock-infected 4dpi and 14dpi infected samples, depicting
variation among them (Figure 2B). In PC1, we observed distinct clusters of data representing
the 14dpi and 4dpi lung tissue samples, and separate clusters representing the mock-infected
(4dpi) and 14dpi samples in PC2. Technical triplicate samples of the same groups are

clustered together.
We further compared the dysregulated proteins identified across the two groups
(Infected (4dpi) and infected (14dpi)) to identify the number of common and differentially
expressed proteins. This comparison was carried out using a Venn diagram (Venny 2.1,
https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). Upon comparison, we identified 41 proteins
exclusive to 4dpi tissue samples and 9 exclusive to 14dpi tissue samples when compared with
mock-infected (4dpi) tissue samples, while 9 proteins were shared between the groups
(Supplementary Figure 3). Of the 1,585 proteins dysregulated in the 4dpi lung tissue, 50
were significantly dysregulated (33 upregulated and 17 downregulated; p≤0.05). Among the
dysregulated proteins, most proteins were involved in the blood coagulation, integrin
signaling pathway, alternative complement activation signaling pathway, and plasminogen
activating cascade (PANTHER classification system, version 16.0) [23]. Similarly, of all the
identified proteins in the infected (14dpi) set, 18 were significantly dysregulated (9
upregulated and 9 downregulated; p≤0.05). This included proteins belonging to the
plasminogen activating cascade and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The dysregulated proteins
are graphically represented as a heat map and volcano plots representing distinct proteomic
patterns between the two groups compared to mock-infected Supplementary Figure 4A-C).
We also evaluated the altered protein expression during the acute and convalescence stages of
infection (14dpi vs. 4dpi) (Supplementary Figure 4D).
We further compared the significantly dysregulated proteins identified across both the
infected (4dpi and 14 dpi) lung tissue compared to mock-infected (4dpi), where a crosscomparison of the down-regulated proteins and upregulated proteins from both the groups did
not result in any common protein. However, of the 33 proteins upregulated in the 4dpi tissue
samples, 3 proteins such as superoxide dismutase (Sod2), myosin-2 (Myh2), and calgranulinB (S100a9) were downregulated in the 14dpi tissue samples. These proteins are known to
regulate various cellular processes such as cellular localization, cell adhesion, and cellular
migration. Similarly, amongst the 33 proteins upregulated in the 4dpi lung tissue, 4 proteins,
including Fibrinogen beta chain (Fgb), Ferritin (Fth1), Calpactin I (S100a10), Thymosin
(Tmsb4x) were found to be upregulated in a 14dpi sample. These proteins are involved in the
regulation of biological processes and exhibit catalytic activity. On further comparison of
downregulated proteins identified across both infected (4dpi) and infected (14dpi), two
proteins were in common such as serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (Srsf1) and Guanine

Functional characteristic of significantly altered proteins
To systematically investigate the molecular differences in the hamster lung owing to SARSCoV-2 infection, we carried out a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the significantly
dysregulated proteins. The biological process such as ‘platelet degranulation’, ‘regulated
exocytosis’ and ‘fibrinolysis’ were enriched mainly in the proteins upregulated in infected
(4dpi) lung tissues, whereas ‘wound healing’, ‘collagen fibril organization’ and ‘actin
cytoskeleton reorganization’ were enriched in downregulated proteins (Supplementary
Table 2). The proteins associated with these pathways include fibrinogen (Fga, Fgb, and
Fgg); complement

factors

(C4a,

C3); alpha-2-antiplasmin

(Serpinf2);

Alpha-1-B

Glycoprotein (A1bg), Apolipoprotein A1 (Apoa1) and Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (Orm1).
Notably, the terms such as ‘regulation of substrate adhesion-dependent cell spreading’
and ‘endothelial cell migration’ were mostly observed in upregulated and downregulated
proteins in 14dpi (Supplementary Table 3). The reduced expression of the proteins involved
in these pathways contributes to dysregulation in actin polymerization. Reports also indicate
that any alteration in the cell-matrix adhesion and extracellular matrix during an injury repair
can disrupt lung structure, further leading to lung damage. Our results also indicate the
dysregulation of collagens in the 14dpi lung tissues. The proteins associated with ‘endothelial
cell migration’ include Thymosin beta-4 (TMSB4X) and high mobility group box 1
(HMGB1), both of which have been reported to be potential therapeutic targets in drug
discovery. TMSB4X is a small and water-soluble peptide known for its role in angiogenesis,
wound healing, and increased metastatic potential of tumor cells [24, 25]. Its ability to induce
fibrinolysis makes it an interesting molecular drug target. Recently, HMGB1 has also
emerged as a potential target for therapeutic interventions for COVID-19. It is known to play
a critical role in various infections, and its elevated expression has been reported in many
viral infections, including in serum of COVID-19 patients [26, 27]. This association further
results in receptor-dependent responses suggesting its possible role in SARS-CoV-2
infection. Further studies are warranted to uncover the underlying mechanism of HMGB1
and evaluate its inhibitors in the COVID-19 treatment.
Pathway analysis
KEGG pathway analyses of the differentially expressed proteins in lung tissue at 4dpi
compared to mock-infected (4dpi) tissue revealed that SARS-CoV-2-triggered the activation

of complement and coagulation cascade and ferroptosis. The analysis also resulted in the
identification of other aberrant pathways such as platelet activation, focal adhesion, and tight
junction. Interestingly, we also observed an aberrant expression of proteins associated with
necroptosis, cholesterol metabolism, ferroptosis and interleukin-17 signaling pathway in the
14dpi tissue samples suggestive of the underlying mechanisms that lead to tissue damage and
lung injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2C).
Ferroptosis, is a form of programmed cell death associated with unchecked lipid
peroxidation due to the accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells. Its role
is well documented in pathophysiological processes of various diseases, such as tumors,
nervous system diseases, ischemia-reperfusion injury, kidney injury, and blood diseases [28].
Iron is a pivotal component of the ferroptosis pathway and disruption of iron metabolism has
been reported in COVID-19 patients [29]. In our study, we observed increased ferritin (Fth1)
levels in 4dpi tissues sample. Its increased expression has also been reported in COVID-19
patients [30, 31].
Platelets are anucleated cell fragments derived from megakaryocytes and essential for
physiological hemostasis. Additionally, they are also known for their diverse role during
inflammatory and immune response by acting as inflammatory effector cells [32, 33]. They
also serve as an indispensable element in coagulation and inflammation and their activated
state is associated with cancer progression [34]. Recently, the lung has also been proposed as
a platelet biogenesis site, accounting for almost 50% of total platelets [35]. There are reports
demonstrating the role of platelets in inflammatory lung syndromes/disorders such as acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
cystic fibrosis (CF), aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), and asthma [33]. The
significant enrichment of coagulation proteins in SARS-CoV2 infected tissues indicates
disruption of coagulation mechanisms during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Secretory proteins
To investigate the amount of secretory proteins among the pool of differentially expressed
proteins in the infected tissue samples, we compared our data with the proteins annotated as
‘secretory proteins (2,640 proteins)’, ‘Secreted in the blood (729 proteins)’, ‘Lung enriched
(13 proteins)’, ‘Lung proteome (19,649 proteins)’ and ‘Group enriched (61 proteins
expressed in the lung)’ (Supplementary Figure 4E). We found four proteins, Ager,

secretoglobin family 1A member 1 (Scgb1a1), Sftpb, and Sftpd identified in the current study
were specific to lung proteome. Pulmonary surfactant proteins constitute a type of lipoprotein
complex comprising of 90% lipids and 10% surfactant proteins (Sftpa, Sftpb, Sftpc, and
Sftpd). These surfactant proteins contribute to providing defense against pathogens and play a
critical role in efficient gaseous exchange at the air-liquid interface in the alveoli and provide
lung stability [36]. We observed aberrant expression of the surfactant proteins (Sftpb, and
Sftpd) across the 4 and 14dpi infected samples compared to the mock-infected samples
suggesting the decline in the normal functionality of lung respiratory gaseous exchange
owing to virus infection. The previous report has suggested the role of viral proteins in
modulating the surfactant metabolism and thus, resulting in host immune compromise [37].
Scgb1a1 encodes a member of the secretoglobin family of small secreted proteins, a
component of pulmonary surfactant, which is expressed in mucus-secreting cells. This
protein is known for its anti-inflammatory/ immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic functions
[38]. We identified severe downregulation of Scgb1a1 in the lung tissue post-infection (4dpi),
suggesting respiratory distress owing to virus-mediated lung injury. Reports have also
reported its altered expression following lung injury and where its absence is marked with the
greater inflammatory response [39-41]. It is also known to regulate alveolar macrophage and
respond to inflammation upon virus invasion [41].
As reported earlier, we also noticed distinct damage to the epithelial-endothelial
barrier in 4dpi infected lung tissues. This barrier system's damage is believed to be the major
mediator of ARDS in different respiratory viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2 [42]. The
loss of the epithelial-endothelial barrier allows leakage of blood components into the alveolar
lumen and lung interstitium. At the same time, it also allows the leakage of lung proteins into
circulation [43]. In the recent past, it is shown that COVID-19 patients who developed ARDS
have significantly higher IL-6 and SP-D circulatory levels compared to patients who did not
have ARDS [44]. These findings further indicate that identification of pneumoproteins in
circulation is an indicator of the severity of lung pathology. In our lung tissue proteome
analysis, we noticed significant downregulation of Sftpd protein in tissues with high lung
pathology score (4dpi), which suggests that certain proteins might have a differential pattern
of expression level in circulation and at the primary site of infection (lungs). Based on several
features of pulmonary surfactants, they are believed to have importance in COVID-19
pathogenesis, diagnosis or therapy. It has been proposed that a lower concentration of
pulmonary surfactant is a critical risk factor for COVID-19 [45]. Studies have also reported
16

that concentration of SP-A and SP-B were low in BAL of patients before and after onset of
ARDS [46]. The low level of pulmonary surfactant proteins detected in 4dpi lung tissues
underscores their possible role in the COVID-19 pathology. Altogether, these pulmonary
lung surfactants might be considered as potential therapeutic targets which will aid in
COVID-19 treatment. However, further studies are required to study its effectiveness and the
underlying mechanism(s) associated with virus infection. Further, it suggests the usefulness
of the hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection in evaluating the therapeutic efficacies of
these proteins for COVID-19.
Comparison with previous studies
Through an ultra-high-throughput clinical proteomics approach, Messner et al., identified
protein expression signatures in serum/plasma samples including complement factors,
components of coagulation systems, immunomodulators and proinflammatory factors that
can classify COVID-19 patients based on WHO grading [1]. The authors have proposed 27
protein groups (23 upregulated and 4 downregulated) as potential biomarkers of disease
severity. Out of these upregulated proteins, we noticed six proteins (Cfb, Fga, Fgb, Fgg, Hp
and Lgals3bp) are also present in the list of upregulated proteins at 4dpi vs. mock-infected
groups of our study. However, Alb, and Tf whose downregulation correlated with COVID-19
severity [1] are found to be upregulated at the 4dpi infection group of our study. There are
multiple possible reason for this discrepancy like (a) blood proteome and lung proteome
might be different in SARS-CoV-2 infected human or animals, (b) difference in techniques
or methods used to analyze samples and (c) possible differential species-dependent (hamster
or human) host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, proteomic and metabolomics
profiling of serum samples obtained from 46 COVID-19 and 53 control individuals showed
deregulation of three major pathways namely complement system, macrophage function and
platelet degranulation in severe COVID-19 patients [47]. Study by Park J et al., employed an
in-depth proteome profiling of undepleted plasma revealed signatures of proteins involved in
neutrophil activation, platelet function, and T cell suppression [3]. Based on the findings, this
study's investigators have proposed specific plasma proteins as predictive biomarkers of
COVID-19 [3]. In a different study, proteomic analysis of serum samples from early COVID19 patients also identified differentially expressed proteins known to have a function in
SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated inflammation and immune signaling [4]. The findings of
our study also corroborate the aforementioned findings.

Efforts have been made to investigate the alteration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
(BALF) proteome in COVID-19 patients compared with the non-COVID controls. This
study's findings demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces alteration in BALF
proteome with enrichment of proteins involved in proinflammatory cytokine-mediated
signaling and oxidative stress response [2]. In this study we found a significantly higher level
of Superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2) in infected 4dpi tissues than 4dpi mock-infected or 14dpi
infected tissues (Figure 3). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is vital for human health and
upregulation of SOD2 expression upon challenge with human pathogens suggests its role in
immune response. Antioxidant enzymes such as SOD2 are pivotal to protect from free
superoxide anion, which can damage epithelial cells and impair their function. Thus enhanced
expression of Sod2 in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamster lungs, suggests the upregulation of
antioxidant response to prevent the oxidative stress-induced tissue damage, lung injury and
respiratory distress.
The present study has some limitations of the small sample size considered for the
analysis. This demands similar extensive research in a large number of animals for further
validation. Taken together, the current study highlights the proteomic alterations caused
owing to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the course of infection and provides an insight on the
molecular pathogenesis and possible therapeutic targets of COVID-19. Importantly, the
current study provides strong molecular evidence that shows the similarities between SARSCoV-2 infection in human and hamster and advocates the clinical relevance of this model in
COVID-19 research.
