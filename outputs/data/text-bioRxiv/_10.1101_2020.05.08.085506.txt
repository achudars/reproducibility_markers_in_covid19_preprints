Abstract

25

As the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues, serological assays are urgently needed for rapid

26

diagnosis, contact tracing and for epidemiological studies. So far, there is little data on how

27

commercially available tests perform with real patient samples and if detected IgG antibodies

28

provide protective immunity. Focusing on IgG antibodies, we demonstrate the performance of two

29

ELISA assays (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG & Vircell COVID-19 ELISA IgG) in comparison to one lateral

30

flow assay ((LFA) FaStep COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Device) and two in-house developed assays

31

(immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)). We tested follow

32

up serum/plasma samples of individuals PCR-diagnosed with COVID-19. Most of the SARS-CoV-2

33

samples were from individuals with moderate to severe clinical course, who required an in-patient

34

hospital stay.

35

For all examined assays, the sensitivity ranged from 58.8 to 76.5% for the early phase of infection

36

(days 5-9) and from 93.8 to 100% for the later period (days 10-18) after PCR-diagnosed with COVID-

37

19. With exception of one sample, all positive tested samples in the analysed cohort, using the

38

commercially available assays examined (including the in-house developed IFA), demonstrated

39

neutralizing (protective) properties in the PRNT, indicating a potential protective immunity to SARS-

40

CoV-2. Regarding specificity, there was evidence that samples of endemic coronavirus (HCoV-OC43,

41

HCoV-229E) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infected individuals cross-reacted in the ELISA assays and

42

IFA, in one case generating a false positive result (may giving a false sense of security). This need to

43

be further investigated.

Background

46

SARS-CoV-2 is a new Coronavirus, belonging to the group of betacoronaviruses, which emerged in

47

December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It is the causative agent of an acute respiratory disease known as

48

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The spectrum of clinical signs can be very broad and

49

asymptomatic infections are reported. The virus has rapidly spread globally. On 11 March 2020 the

50

World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. Nucleic acid amplification

51

testing (NAT) is the method of choice in the early phase of infection (1). However, to acquire

52

knowledge about the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and to test for (potential) individual immunity,

53

there is an increasing demand in the detection of antibodies – especially of IgG antibodies.

54

Convalescent plasma may be used for therapeutic or prophylactic approaches as vaccines and other

55

drugs are under development (2). For all these purposes, sensitive and especially highly specific

56

antibody assays are needed. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has shown to be highly

57

immunogenic and is the main target for neutralizing antibodies (3). Currently there are many S

58

protein based commercially or in-house developed assays available, but there is limited data on how

59

these tests perform with clinical samples and if the detected IgG antibodies provide protective

60

immunity. This study aims to provide a quick overview on some of these assays (two commercial

61

available ELISA, an LFA, an IFA and a PRNT, focusing on the detection and neutralization capacity of

62

IgG antibodies in follow up serum or plasma samples of individuals with PCR-diagnosed infections

63

with SARS-CoV-2. To assess potential cross-reactivity, we examined defined follow-up samples of

64

individuals infected with endemic coronaviruses and other infectious diseases.

Materials and methods

67

Serum and plasma samples

68

We collected follow up serum or plasma samples (in the following simply stated as samples) from

69

individuals with PCR-diagnosed infections with SARS-CoV-2 (n=33) at different time points (table 1).

70

Most of these individuals had a moderate to severe clinical course and required an in-patient hospital

71

stay at the intensive care unit. Additionally, follow up samples of recent PCR-diagnosed infections

72

with SARS-CoV (3 patients from the 2003 outbreak), HCoV-OC43 (n=4), HCoV-HKU1 (n=1), HCoV-

73

NL63 (n=2), HCoV-229E (n=4) and recent serological/PCR-diagnosed infections with acute EBV (n=4,

74

three serologically EBV-VCA-IgM positive and one PCR- and serologically EBV-VCA-IgM positive) and

75

acute CMV (n=3) (all serologically IgM and PCR-positive) were collected. The samples of individuals

76

infected with endemic human coronavirus, CMV and EBV were used to assess potential cross

77

reactivity and the risk of potential false positive results.

78

Lateral flow assay

79

The FasStep (COVID-19 IgG/IgM) rapid test cassettes (COV-W32M, Assure Tech (Hangzhou) Co., Ltd,

80

China) were used according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. We have no details on the used

81

antigen component. 10 µl serum and two drops of sample buffer were applied to the sample well.

82

Test results were visually evaluated after 10 minutes.

83

ELISA

84

The CE certified versions of the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany)

85

and Vircell COVID-19 ELISA IgG (Vircell Spain S.L.U., Granada, Spain) were used, in an identical

86

manner, according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Both ELISAS use SARS-CoV-2

87

recombinant antigen from spike glycoprotein (S protein) and the Vircell ELISA additionally

88

Nucleocapsid (N protein). Samples were diluted 1:101 or 1:20, respectively, in sample buffer and

89

incubated at 37° for 60 min in a 96-well microtiter plate followed by each protocols washing and

90

incubation cycles, including controls and required reagents. Optical density (OD) was measured for

92

signal-to-cut-off ratio was calculated and values expressed according to each manufacturer’s

protocol.

94

Immunofluorescence assay (IFA)

95

For an immunofluorescence assay Vero cells (african green monkey, ATCC CCL-81 (American Type

96

Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia, USA)) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and harvested two days

97

post infection. Briefly, cells were trypsinized and washed once with PBS before transferred onto a 10-

98

well diagnostic microscope slides. After drying, cells were fixated with 100% ethanol for 10 minutes.

99

Patient samples were diluted in sample buffer (Euroimmun AG, Lübeck, Germany) in a dilution of

100

1:50 and 30 µl applied per well. The slides were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour and washed three times

101

with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-Tween (0.1%) for 5 minutes. 25 µl of goat-anti human

102

fluorescein-labeled IgG conjugate was used as secondary antibody. The slides then were incubated

103

for 30 minutes and washed three times with PBS-Tween for 5 minutes. The microscopic analysis was

104

performed by 200-fold magnification using a Leica DMLS fluorescence microscope (Leica

105

Mikrosysteme Vertrieb GmbH, Wetzlar Germany).

carcinoma cells, ATCC DSMZ ACC-169 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia, USA))

110

were seeded on a 96-well plate 3-5 days prior infection. 2-fold dilutions of the test sera beginning

Results

120

In the early phase of infection, from days 5-9 after PCR-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2, the in-

121

house developed IFA and PRNT showed a sensitivity of 76.5% (13/17), the Vircell ELISA a sensitivity of

122

70.6% (12/17), the Assure Tech Rapid Test a sensitivity of 62.5% (10/16) and the Euroimmun ELISA a

123

sensitivity of 58.8% (10/17). For the later period from days 10-18, the Euroimmun ELISA and Assure

124

Tech Rapid Test showed a sensitivity 93.8% (15/16), the Vircell ELISA, IFA and PRNT of 100% (16/16) -

125

(TABLE 1). For selected samples (SARS-CoV samples from the 2003 outbreak excluded, TABLE S2), the

126

Euroimmun ELISA showed a specificity of 95.7%, generating a borderline result for the HCoV-OC43

127

sample, the Vircell ELISA of 95.2%, generating a positive result for HCoV-229E sample and the in-

128

house developed IFA of 100% (an unspecific result for one EBV sample was excluded). Including the

129

three SARS-CoV samples from the 2003 outbreak, the Euroimmun ELISA showed a specificity of

130

96.2% (not generating any cross-reactive results for the SARS-CoV samples), the IFA of 86.4% and the

131

Vircell ELISA of 83.3% (both assays generating positive results for all three SARS-CoV samples). The

132

Assure Tech Rapid Test did not generate any false positive results for the tested samples. None of the

133

other tested samples cross-reacted in terms of generating borderline or false positive results.

assays (including the IFA and Assure Tech Rapid Test), detected SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In sample 1,

141

only the Vircell ELISA, in sample 4 and 19 only the Vircell ELISA and PRNT (including the IFA) detected

142

antibodies. In samples 12 and 16, only the PRNT (and IFA) detected antibodies (in sample 16 with a

143

titer <1:10). With exception of sample 1, all with the ELISA positive tested samples were also positive

144

tested with the IFA. In the detection of antibodies, the IFA performed like the PRNT on all examined

Discussion

154

In terms of sensitivity, our data are consistent with previously published data. In a study from Liu et

155

al., using an rS-based ELISA assay, the group found SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in less than 60% of the

156

samples from days 6-10 after disease onset. The sensitivity increased to >90% in samples from days

157

16-20 (4).

158

seroconversion in all examined follow-up serum samples of COVID-19 patients by day 14 after onset

159

of symptoms. The samples were further analyzed via PRNT, all showed neutralization activity against

160

SARS-CoV-2 (5).

161

An important finding of our study is, that (with exception of sample 1) all detected SARS-CoV-2 IgG

162

antibodies in the analyzed cohort, using the commercially available assays examined, demonstrated

163

neutralizing (protective) properties in the PRNT. The screening for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies

164

[especially for potential protective IgG antibodies against the S protein (6)] using ELISA or lateral flow

165

assays is more convenient and practicable than using the hands on- and time-intensive IFA or PRNT,

166

which can only be performed by experienced personnel, and the PRNT, only in a BSL-3 laboratory.

167

ELISA based assays can be automated and used for larger sample sizes. Lateral flow assays can be

168

used by less experienced personnel in a point-of-care setting, generating results in short time. Some

169

samples, however, were only detected with the IFA and PRNT as gold standard. The titer needed for

170

potential protective immunity is not yet (officially) defined. In one study, it is reported, that a

171

individual cleared SARS-CoV-2 without developing antibodies up to 46 days after illness (7). The

172

mechanism of immunity, especially of protective immunity (if applicable) and how long it will last,

173

need to be further investigated. Besides humoral mediated immunity, there is evidence that T-cell

174

mediated immunity plays a role (8). Most of the SARS-CoV-2 samples analysed in this study were

175

from individuals with moderate to severe clinical course, who required an in-patient hospital stay.

176

We have also tested follow-up samples of individuals PCR-diagnosed with COVID-19 with mild or no

177

symptoms at all, IgG antibodies could only be detected after 6 weeks (data not shown). In terms of

178

specificity, cross-reacting antibodies of endemic coronavirus infected individuals or of individuals

In a study from Wölfel et al., using an in-house developed IFA, the group found

179

with other active infectious diseases (e.g. EBV or CMV) are a known phenomenon (9). The examined

180

assays in our study demonstrated a good specificity. Only the Vircell ELISA generated one positive

181

result for one HCoV-229E sample, whereas the Euroimmun ELISA generated only one borderline

182

result for the HCoV-OC43 sample and the IFA an unspecific signal in one EBV sample. For the Assure

183

Tech Rapid Test, no cross-reactions were observed, however, a larger sample size would be needed

184

to get a clearer picture. The cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV samples from the outbreak of 2003 in

185

the Vircell ELISA and IFA are of less importance as the virus is known to be eradicated. Nonetheless,

186

as a false positive result might give a false sense of security, efforts should be made to further

187

improve the specificity of the available assays. All in our study examined assays are eligible for the

188

detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, indicating a potential protective immunity. Ideally, to get the

189

maximum sensitivity, testing should be performed in the later phase of infection (≥ 10 days) after

190

PCR-confirmation or disease onset of COVID-19. The Vircell ELISA, IFA and PRNT demonstrated the

191

highest sensitivity throughout our study. At the moment, however, the PRNT is still the method of

192

choice for questions regarding potential SARS-CoV-2 immunity and should be performed when

193

available.
