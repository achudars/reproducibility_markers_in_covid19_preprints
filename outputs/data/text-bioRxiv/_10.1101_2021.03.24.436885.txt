ABSTRACT
The association of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 viral spike with human
angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2) represents the first required step for viral entry. Amino
acid changes in the RBD have been implicated with increased infectivity and potential for immune
evasion. Reliably predicting the effect of amino acid changes in the ability of the RBD to interact
more strongly with the hACE2 receptor can help assess the public health implications and the
potential for spillover and adaptation into other animals. Here, we introduce a two-step framework
that first relies on 48 independent 4-ns molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of RBD-hACE2
variants to collect binding energy terms decomposed into Coulombic, covalent, van der Waals,
lipophilic, generalized Born electrostatic solvation, hydrogen-bonding, π-π packing and selfcontact correction terms. The second step implements a neural network to classify and
quantitatively predict binding affinity using the decomposed energy terms as descriptors. The
computational base achieves an accuracy of 82.2% in terms of correctly classifying single aminoacid substitution variants of the RBD as worsening or improving binding affinity for hACE2 and
a correlation coefficient r of 0.69 between predicted and experimentally calculated binding

affinities. Both metrics are calculated using a 5-fold cross validation test. Our method thus sets up
a framework for effectively screening binding affinity change with unknown single and multiple
amino-acid changes. This can be a very valuable tool to predict host adaptation and zoonotic
spillover of current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Introduction
The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to be a major global challenge to
public health and has caused unprecedented losses to the global economy1 and ecology2. Multiple
vaccines have received emergency use authorization (Pfizer, Moderna and J&J) and additional
vaccines are under Phase-3 clinical trials (AstraZeneca, Janssen and Novavax) in the United States.
However, several new variants of the wild-type (WT) virus (i.e., isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank:
MN908947) have emerged in United Kingdom4 (B.1.1.7 lineage), South Africa5 (B.1.351 lineage),
and Brazil6 (P.1 lineage) with increasing prevalence worldwide.7 A few non-synonymous
mutations leading to amino-acid changes in the spike protein of these variants are associated with
enhanced infectivity. The enhanced infectivity of the variants is possibly through increased binding
affinity of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein with the human angiotensin
converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) receptor8 and through changes in the conformational dynamics of
the spike protein.9 Although a recent preliminary report suggests that the current vaccines can still
effectively protect people from SARS-CoV-2 variants10, another report showed that plasma from
recipients of Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines was significantly
less effective in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 variants encoding E484K or N501Y or the
K417N:E484K:N501Y combination.11 In addition, a significant decrease in neutralizing titers
against the B.1.351 but not the B.1.1.7 UK variant, with plasma from mRNA-1273 vaccinated
humans and non-human primates has been observed.12 Hence, continued surveillance and methods
to accurately predict affinity gains of the RBD-hACE2 binding event due to amino acid changes
in the RBD are extremely important.
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 30 kb
size13. The mutation rates of RNA viruses upon replication are generally higher than DNA viruses,
which could be as high as 10−4 to 10−3 per nucleotide incorporated 14 SARS-CoV-2 has a mutation
rate of on average 7.23 mutations per sample15 which is significantly lower than HIV and
Influenza-A viruses.1617 The simultaneous incorporation of multiple (i.e., 15-20) amino-acid
changes in a few emerging strains such as ΔFVI (Danish mink), B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.1.54 (SA) are a

cause of concern as it suggests further adaptation of the virus and fitness gains in humans and other
animals.18,19,20 Several of these variants involve amino acid changes in the spike protein suspected
to increase transmissibility21, alter infectivity22,23 and/or escape neutralizing antibodies.22,24 The
viral spike protein binding to the hACE2 protein is the first and crucial step in viral entry.25–31 The
spike protein makes contact with hACE2 using 16 residues of the 223 amino acid long receptor
binding domain (RBD) forming multiple polar and hydrophobic interactions.32 The binding
strength between RBD and hACE2 thus directly affects infection dynamics and potentially disease
progression. Starr et al.33 exhaustively assessed the impact of single amino acid changes in the
RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 quantifying the effects on RBD expression and hACE2 binding. It was
revealed that most amino acid changes (i.e., 84.5%) are detrimental for RBD expression and
hACE2 binding, around 7.5% of mutations are neutral but about 8% enhance hACE2 binding. The
corresponding amino acid changes in RBD that lead to enhancements in binding with hACE2 can
potentially become additive in their contribution to receptor affinity. Even though the RBD
accounts for only 2% of the amino acid changes observed in the entire spike protein34, it is the
target for more than 90% of the neutralization antibodies generated by humoral response 35.
Therefore, RBD is the most susceptible target to antigenic escape by amino acid changes.
Consequently, amino acid changes in RBD that can increase binding affinity with hACE2 and/or
adversely affect antibody neutralization have been extensively mapped by high-throughput
mutational studies.36,37 For example, the amino acid change Y453F in the RBD present in the ΔFVI
(Danish mink) variant increases the binding affinity to hACE2 by four fold38 while also managing
to partially evade the monoclonal antibody REGN10933 present in the Regeneron antibody
cocktail.39 These studies highlight the importance of monitoring single and multiple amino acid
changes in the spike RBD variants and their potential for increased binding affinity with ACE2
and/or immune escape. It is important to note that binding of the viral RBD with the hACE2
receptor is a necessary step but is not sufficient to cause a productive viral infection. Proteolytic
cleavage of S1/S2 and S2’ sites is also needed to expose the fusion peptide enabling membrane
fusion followed by viral entry at the surface or upon endocytosis.40 Furthermore, the host cellular
environment must be permissive to viral RNA genome replication, translation to proteins and
assembly into new virions.41
Computational methods can help assess the mechanistic role of the amino acid changes occurring
in circulating viral variants and also predict potentially problematic amino acid changes that have
not been identified so far. In a recent study, Chowdhury et al.32 biophysically characterized the
binding interactions of human ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, uncovering the
molecular details associated with the increased infectivity of CoV-2, relative to CoV. In another
effort, Mohammad et al.42 calculated that the D614G variant has a higher computational binding
interaction energy with furin. This was later experimentally corroborated revealing that the D614G
change both increases RBD accessibility to binding with hACE243 and enhances the efficiency of

furin cleavage.44 Zhou et al.24 performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular
mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) analysis on the N439K variant
suggesting a higher binding affinity to hACE2 and resistance to the antibody REGN10987. These
findings were supported by experimental evidence for the N439K variant escaping several
neutralizing antibodies including REGN1098724. Several studies focus on testing the effect of one
or several key single mutations, but systematic methods to predict and analyze a wider multimutational landscape are still lacking. It is worth noting that Chen45 et al. used an algebraic
topology-based machine learning model to quantify the binding free energy changes of RBD from
several existing CoV-2 variants. However, the performance of the method used was tested on the
general SKEMPI-2.046 dataset and not on a SARS-CoV-2 specific dataset.
Several computational approaches have been developed to predict the effect of amino-acid
substitutions on protein-protein binding affinity. Some of them directly use energies from
molecular-mechanics based empirical force-fields like FoldX47 and Rosetta48,49 or energies from
molecular mechanics – generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) analysis of ensembles
obtained from MD simulations50. Other methods such as SAAMBE51 and BindProfX52, use a
combination of physical energies and residue-level structural properties or sequence-based
conservation profiles, respectively. Purely statistical potentials like BeAtMuSiC53 and Contact
potentials54 have also been explored. Updating the weights of energy terms using experimentally
determined Gbind defined as the change in the free energy of binding upon amino-acid changes
(i.e., Gbind = Gvariant- GWT) has been shown to improve the prediction performance55,56 of
molecular mechanics-based force-fields such as Rosetta49. The recently introduced machine
learning (ML) based method TopNetTree achieves a better correlation coefficient over several
existing methods on two benchmark datasets AB-Bind and SKEMPI.57 In spite of the existence of
many different Gbind prediction methods, as reviewed recently58, performance is not always
robust on unseen datasets not part of training data. The major limiting factor contributing to test
set prediction inaccuracies is the paucity of experimental datasets (on Gbind) with good coverage
of both types and locations of amino acid changes.58
In this work, we first tested the predictive power of both parameterized force fields (i.e.,
Rosetta49,59) and detailed MM-GBSA60–62 analysis of MD simulation trajectories with explicit
water molecules treatment 63,64 (see Table 1) in reproducing experimental RBD-hACE2 binding
affinity data reported by Starr et al.33 Predictions using the MM-GBSA binding energies provided
only partial agreement with experimental data (i.e., r = 0.33). Therefore, we next used experimental
RBD-hACE2 binding energy terms to train a neural network (NN) regression model (NN_MMGBSA) using the decomposed MM-GBSA energy terms as features and the experimental
dissociation constants (KD,app) ratio between mutated variants and the wild-type as the regression
target. Figure 3 pictorially illustrates the computational pipeline employed for building the model.

Agreement between experiment and the NN_MM-GBSA model predictions were significantly
better than raw MM-GBSA energies reaching a correlation coefficient of r = 0.69 and an accuracy
of 82.24% in recovering of the effect of amino-acid changes (i.e., in classifying as improving or
worsening the binding affinity). The NN_MM-GBSA model also provided good predictions on
binding affinities of the RBD from currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants (see Table 2). The
achieved accuracy of prediction makes this model a useful tool for the computational assessment
of current/emerging CoV-2 variants. The MM-GBSA energies and the NN_MM-GBSA model are

Results
Dataset preparation
The three-dimensional coordinates of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain in complex with
human ACE2 were obtained from PDB entry 6LZG65. There exist 20 RBD residues contacting
directly with hACE2 and making strong interactions at the binding interface.33 This gives a total
of 380 possible single amino-acid variants by changing each one of the 20 RBD residues into the
remaining 19 amino-acids. Of these, we chose all 27 variants with an increased binding affinity
and 54 variants with lower binding affinity compared to the WT. The dataset was balanced by
adding another 27 variants that exhibited binding enhancement though not in direct contact with
hACE2 (see Supp. Table 1 for details). The selected 108 variants formed the training dataset in
this study (see Figure 1). All RBD variants in the dataset were computationally modeled using
Rosetta48,49 and analyzed for changes in binding affinity with hACE2 compared to the WT RBD.
Experimental data on variant binding affinities were obtained from the deep mutagenesis study by
Starr et. al.33 The study reported apparent dissociation constant KD,app ratios for all possible variants
with single-amino acid changes at every RBD position. A KD,app ratio (i.e., KD,app,WT/KD,app,variant)
for a variant greater than one implies stronger binding compared to WT, whereas a value less than
one implies weaker binding (see also Figure 1C). KD,app ratios can be related to changes in the free
energy of binding (i.e., Gbind) as (KD,app,variant)/(KD,app,WT) = exp(-Gbind/RT). This enables
direct comparison of experimental measurements with estimates in changes of free energy of
binding from MM-GBSA and other computational methods (see Methods for details).

Binding affinity change prediction for variants using MM-GBSA values from MD simulations
For each RBD variant, we first performed MD simulation of the hACE2-RBD complex followed
by MM-GBSA analysis on frames derived from the simulation to calculate binding energies. For
each variant, 48 independent initial configurations of the complex are generated by Monte Carlo
minimization66 (see Methods). Starting from each configuration, a 4ns unconstrained MD

simulation was carried out which generated a total of 192ns of MD trajectory for each variant. We
used a sequence of short simulations, starting from several independent configurations instead of
one long simulation trajectory - as it led to faster convergence, as also reported previously.67 3D
coordinates of the complex were extracted from each trajectory upon removing the solvent
molecules after every 0.1ns, generating 1,920 different frames for each variant. MM-GBSA
energies were calculated for all frames (see Methods) and subsequently averaged in 240 bins
chosen randomly to obtain an ensemble of eight binding energy predictions for each variant. The
median value of the ensemble of eight predictions was then chosen as the predicted binding energy
Gvariant of the variant. The binding energy change for each variant Gbind is then obtained by
subtracting the binding energy of the WT RBD-hACE2 complex GWT. A negative Gbind value
(corresponds to KD,app ratio > 1) indicates improved binding affinity with hACE2, whereas a
positive Gbind value (corresponding to KD,app ratio < 1) implies lower binding affinity.

Using this computational workflow, we calculated the Gbind for the balanced dataset of 108
RBD variants. We score classification predictions using the percent recovery of correct variant
classification (%VC) in terms of the direction of change in the binding affinity compared to WT.
Note that a balanced training set was maintained, so as to alleviate the risk of biased predictions
due to having more variants with worsening or improving binding affinities. We score quantitative
binding affinity prediction using the Pearson correlation coefficient r (see Methods) between
predicted and experimental Gbind values. We find that (see also Table 1) Rosetta slightly
outperforms MM-GBSA in both prediction of the direction of change (i.e., %VC) and r value. This
could be because of the scaling of the energy function within MM-GBSA not being in line with
values obtained from experimental measurements leading to some outliers having very large
predicted values (see Figure 2), causing a lower r value (i.e., r=0.33) than Rosetta (i.e., 0.47). In
addition to the energy function from Rosetta49, three other computational servers were tested for
the prediction; mCSM-PPI268 utilizing graph-based signatures, the random forest model
MutaBind269 trained with Molecular Mechanics energies70 and evolutionary scores71, and
SAAMBE-3d72 which uses a machine learning model trained on structural features. Using
MutaBind2 and mCSM-PPI2, the performance in both %VC and r-value was worse than that of
MM-GBSA and Rosetta. The predictions from SAAMBE-3d had a good correlation value r but
were very poor in %VC (=0.53), almost the same as random prediction. This may be due to the
fact that Rosetta and MM-GBSA attain a higher fidelity in the description of the underlying
biophysics by using a detailed fully atomistic description of interactions and hence are better at
distinguishing improving vs. worsening variants. Note that, since the numerical values Gbind for
variants improving the binding affinity are quite small (maximum of ~ -0.3 kcal/mol) compared to
those worsening the binding affinity (maximum of ~ +2.5kcal/mol), both metrics need to be
simultaneously high to indicate robust prediction. Nevertheless, prediction metrics %VC and r
calculated for MM-GBSA (or Rosetta) do not attain values that reflect reliable quantitative
prediction. We next focused on improving prediction fidelity. This was accomplished by not
merely using various energy terms in an additive fashion to assemble the overall binding energy,
but instead by relying on a neural network to construct a nonlinear reassortment of these energy
terms.

Neural network regression model trained on MM-GBSA energies and experimental Kd,app ratios
A neural network (NN) regression model with a single input and single output layer was built,
targeting quantitative prediction of the Kd,app values for the 108 RBD variants. The NN had four
fully connected hidden layers with 144 nodes in each layer (see Methods for details). The MMGBSA ensemble of energies obtained from the MD trajectories of each variant was fed as input
features. Each variant entry in the training set contains all 18 MM-GBSA energy terms (see
Methods for description of terms) replicated for all eight sets of the ensemble. After passing
through the hidden and output layers, each of the eight sets of energies outputs a single predicted
value for Kd,app. The model was trained to minimize the mean sum of squared error between the
predicted Kd,app and experimental Kd,app values (see Methods for details). When making a prediction,
each of the eight sets of energies is fed into the trained model to get a single Kd,app prediction and
the final prediction value is recovered by taking the median of predictions from all eight ensembles.
The overall computational workflow is summarized in Figure 3.
During training and assessment of the model, a five-fold cross validation procedure was followed.
During each cross-validation cycle, the 108 variants are randomly assigned to five groupings of
approximately equal size. Four of these subsets are used as the training sets whereas the fifth
becomes the testing set. This approach was chosen so that the testing set used to assess the
prediction performance of the NN model is never used to train the predicting NN model. This 5fold cross-validation was repeated 5 times using random assignments for the testing set. This led
to the construction of 5x5 = 25 independently trained NN models with an average value of r=0.69
(obtained across the 25 models) and a standard deviation of only 0.03 implying both robust and
accurate prediction (see Figure 4). Notably, the correlation coefficient of prediction improved by
more than 2-fold compared to the MM-GBSA method (r=0.33) indicating that a higher order
nonlinear structure, relevant to Gbind prediction embedded in the energy terms, was captured by
the NN model. Correct variant classification (i.e., %VC) was also improved from 64% to 82% (see
also Table 1).

Figure 4. KD,app ratios predicted by NN_MM-GBSA vs. experimental ratios obtained using five
cycles of five-fold cross-validation study on the 108 RBD variants. An average correlation
coefficient of r=0.69 (std. dev.=0.03) and average %VC of 82% (std. dev. = 0.02) were achieved.
The Mean Squared Error was 0.20 (std. dev. = 0.02). The solid diagonal line y=x and the dotted
horizontal and vertical lines at experimental and predicted KD,app ratio = 1 are drawn for reference.
Shown in blue are variants that were correctly classified as improving (or worsening) binding
affinity with hACE2 and in red are the ones that were misclassified.

As a methodological check, we also explored whether the nonlinear nature of the NN model is
needed to reach the gains in prediction or whether a linear regression model could simply re-weight
the energy terms in a linear fashion and achieve similar performance. We found that a linear
regression model improved the correlation coefficient r from 0.33 to 0.53 in comparison with the
MM-GBSA prediction method but lowered %VC from 61% to 59%. This implies that the higherorder nonlinear re-assortment of energy terms is required for reaching improved prediction fidelity.
As a follow up, we also explored if the energy terms from Rosetta49,59 could be used instead of the

ones from MM-GBSA to construct a NN model of equivalent predictive ability. Note that the
Rosetta energy function captures solvation effects implicitly without an explicit treatment of water
molecules. We found that the gains in r and %VC for a NN model trained on the Rosetta energy
terms were less than those seen when trained on MM-GBSA energies (i.e., r = 0.57, %VC=74.63).
Both these analyses suggest that (1) explicit water treatment in MD simulations is important for
correctly describing water-mediated hydrogen bonding and other electrostatic contacts at the
interface while also enabling the sampling of a larger conformational landscape, which is
necessary for capturing binding affinity changes due to nonlocal structural changes,73 and (2) the
higher-order nonlinear regression afforded by a NN_MM-GBSA model are required to reach high
prediction performance.
As a further demonstration that the NN_MM-GBSA model captures variant-specific information
and does not simply carry-out numerical fitting, we performed a data scrambling test. Specifically,
we re-assigned the variant definition (i.e., corresponding amino-acid change) to randomly chosen
input energy terms, thereby destroying any variant-specific correspondence with the input features.
We gradually increased the fraction of data scrambled and re-evaluated NN_MM-GBSA model
performance. We found that as the fraction of scrambled data increases, the performance of the
NN_MM-GBSA model declines. The %VC drops from the original 82.24% to 49.74% (almost
completely random). This test reaffirms that the NN_MM-GBSA model indeed captured variantspecific information.

NN_MM-GBSA model prediction of KD,app ratios of circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains
Several amino-acid changes have been identified in the spike protein of several of the currently
circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.74 Some of the underlying single amino acid mutations were part
of our balanced training set (i.e., N501Y, Y453F) whereas others (i.e., K417T, K417N, E484K,
S477N, L452R,S494P) were not. The predicted KD,app ratios along with experimental values (when
available) and lineage names of variants that contain the corresponding amino acid changes are
tabulated in Table 2. In all cases, amino acid changes were correctly classified as improving or
worsening (i.e., %VC=100) with a good quantitative agreement (see Table 2). Notably, variant
B.1.351 has the amino acid change N501Y first seen in B.1.1.7 along with additional changes
E484K and K417N in the spike. The E484K change has been shown to be responsible for evasion
of neutralization by several antibodies75,76 whereas the N501Y change has been associated with
increased binding affinity to hACE233 and increased transmission.77 Both amino acid changes were
correctly classified by NN_MM-GBSA as improving binding affinity (see Table 2). In Table 2,
we also include predictions for multiple simultaneous amino acid changes present in some
circulating variants, alas experimental values are not available to this date which prevents any
direct comparison. Nevertheless, significantly higher binding affinities were predicted for all tested

double and triple amino acid variants present in currently circulating isolates (i.e., KD,app ratios
greater than 1.26 in all four cases). In addition, we included novel predicted variants
V503W+E406F and V503W+Y505W, which we arrived at by maximizing binding affinity based
on an exhaustive evaluation using the less accurate but more computationally tractable Rosetta
energy function.49 Upon re-scoring using NN_MM-GBSA, we recovered high KD,app ratios (i.e.,
1.28 and 1.23, see Table 2). It is also worth noting that the single amino acid changes E406F and
V503W by themselves cause a decline in binding affinity (experimental KD,app ratio of 0.13 and
0.81) but when applied in combination lead to binding energy gains. This is probably due to a
cooperative hydrophobic effect formed at the binding interface.

Discussion
NN_MM-GBSA is a two-step procedure that uses the energy terms calculated for SARS-CoV-2
RBD variants from MM-GBSA to train a neural network model for predicting the qualitative and
quantitative effects of amino acid changes in the RBD of the spike protein on the binding affinity
with hACE2. Using a balanced training set of 108 variants, the method achieves a Pearson
correlation coefficient of 0.69 between predicted and experimental values for the KD,app ratios. In
addition, the recovery of the correct effect of an amino acid change (i.e., improving or worsening
binding) was 82%. We find that prediction is quite robust in terms of selection of training/testing
sets with a standard deviation for the prediction or r of only 0.03. Notably, Starr et. al33
exhaustively assessed a total of ~4,000 variants for their binding affinity whereas, in this study,
we used only a small fraction of the dataset (108 variants). As we continued to add additional
members to the training dataset of 108 variants, no clear improving (or worsening) trendline was
observed. Clearly, prediction fidelity is better for amino acid changes in positions that include at
least one variant in the balanced training dataset. We plan to continue expanding upon the list;
however, most of the remaining variants involve single amino acid changes far away from the
RBD-hACE2 binding interface and thus contribute progressively less to binding affinity. The true
value of NN_MM-GBSA is not the assessment of variants with single amino acid changes, but the
surveillance for multiple amino acid change variants. We predicted the change in binding affinity
upon the amino acid changes E484K+N501Y+K417N present in B1.351 and
E484K+N501Y+K417T present in P.1. We found that N_MM-GBSA predicts for both, a
significantly increased affinity for hACE2 (see Table 2) suggesting that the effect of amino-acid
changes E484K and N501Y dominate the effect of K417N or K417T which are both known to
decrease the binding affinity by themselves (see Table2).
In addition, we explored the possibility of double amino acid variants with even higher gains in
binding affinity. Two such candidates (V503W+E406F and V503W+Y505W) were identified
through exhaustive enumeration, using the Rosetta energy scoring function.49 For both of them,
method NN_MM-GBSA confirmed high KD,app ratios. These variants introduce large hydrophobic
amino acids at the interface to enhance binding affinity with hACE2. The importance of the
hydrophobic effect in protein-protein binding has been long recognized.82 Specifically, it has also
been shown that the RBD-hACE2 interface is dominated by networks of hydrophobic contacts
forming strong anchors for binding.83
A drawback of NN_MM-GBSA is that it requires a priori MD simulation of the variant under
evaluation and collection of all energy terms using MM-GBSA analysis. This is computationally
costly as a single calculation requires on average a total of 48 GPU-hours and 3 CPU-hours.
Ideally, one could simply use existing energy terms generated from the balanced training set of
108 variants to make predictions for novel variants. However, this would require training a neural

network model with more than just energy terms as descriptors. The use of sequence and/or
structural features could provide a tractable path forward in this direction.
In principle, NN_MM-GBSA can also be used to assess infection potential for other non-human
hosts by SARS-CoV-2 by assessing the binding energies of the spike RBD with the animal ACE2
receptors. The structures of non-human ACE2 are generally unavailable (except for bats84 and
felines85) therefore, the first step would require homology modeling of the ACE2 receptor for the
examined species. Efforts along this direction have been carried out for livestock and companion
animals32 and assessments for high-risk animals are urgently needed. Assuming that training of
NN_MM-GBSA using hACE2 data is robust, it could in principle be used to prospectively assess,
the relative affinity of the RBD of circulating variants for various animal ACE2s. Crucially, this
may provide the first indication that the viral variants have been established in non-human animal
reservoir population(s). These variants can include both those already circulating and ones de novo
predicted.

Methods
Rosetta calculations for independent structure generation
The 3D coordinates of SARS-CoV-2 viral spike RBD in complex with hACE2 were extracted
from the crystal structure with PDB-id 6LZG.65 The obtained WT model was first pre-processed
by removing all solvent molecules and all non-amino acid residues. For each of the 108 RBD
variants with single point amino acid changes, 3D coordinates were generated using
Rosettascripts86. First, the PackRotamers mover was used to build the variants with amino-acid
changes and repack the rotamers. Then, for each variant, 48 independent configurations for MD
simulations were generated using the Relax66 energy minimization protocol.

Molecular dynamics simulations and MM-GBSA analysis
For each variant, the 3D coordinates of 48 independent configurations obtained using Rosetta (as
described above) were prepared using protein preparation wizard87 protocol of Maestro in
Schrödinger suite (v2019.4). Each configuration was then solvated with water using the tip3p64
model in an orthorhombic box with 10 Å buffer distance in each dimension. The residual charges
were neutralized by adding Na+ and Cl− ions at a salt concentration of 0.15 M. The solvated
systems were minimized and pre-equilibrated using the default relaxation protocol of Desmond88
followed by a 4-ns production run using the amber99sb-ildn63 force field at 300 K and 1 atm. The
NPT ensemble with periodic boundary conditions using particle mesh Ewald89 for long-range
interactions. A time step of 2.0 fs was used and a cutoff distance of 9.0 Å was chosen for nonbonded interactions.

For each variant, the 4-ns trajectory for each of the 48 configurations was sampled at an interval
of 0.1 ns, generating 1920 snapshots in total. For each snapshot, the Prime/MM-GBSA analysis62
was performed using thermal_mmgbsa.py script from the Schrödinger suite. The MM-GBSA
analysis produces the binding energy and its constituent eight individual energy terms i.e.,
Coulomb energy, Covalent binding energy, van der Waals energy, Lipophilic energy, Generalized
Born electrostatic solvation energy, Prime energy, Hydrogen-bonding correction, π-π packing
correction, and Self-contact correction. Another set of values for these nine terms have also been
calculated by not accounting for receptor and ligand conformational changes needed to form the
complex. Due to a high degree of variation in the energies, we averaged data from 240 snapshots
to produce a single set of averaged energy terms in the dataset. Thus, a total of 1920 snapshots
generate eight sets of averaged energy terms for each variant. In total, these 18 energy values were
utilized as the input features for NN construction.

Neural network for MM-GBSA energies (NN_MM-GBSA)
A. Dataset Generation: MM-GBSA analysis was used to generate 18 energy components (as
described above) which are fed as the input features for the NN_MM-GBSA model. Each input
energy term across the whole data set was scaled independently to have zero mean and a variance
of one. The output target was set to the experimental apparent dissociation constant KD,app ratios,
(KD,app)variant/(KD,app)WT. The experimental data for the 108 RBD variants (see Supp. Table 1 for list)
was obtained from Starr et. al.33
B. Model Architecture: The neural network has a single input layer, a single output layer and four
fully connected hidden layers with 144 nodes per layer, forming 18-(144-144-144-144)-1 structure.
The rectified linear unit was used as the activation function for all of the hidden layers and the
dropout regularization method was applied to hidden layers, with a dropout rate of 0.5 for the first
and last hidden layers, and 0.75 for the rest.
C. Model Training: The model was trained through backpropagation to minimize the mean squared
error between predicted KD,app and target KD,app values. Adam90 optimizer was used to perform the
backpropagation with a learning rate of 0.001 and weight decay of 0.005. The training was
performed for 2,000 epochs including the entire training data in each batch.
D. Model Evaluation: We used a five-fold cross validation protocol to evaluate the model, by
splitting the whole dataset into 5 subsets. In one complete evaluation cycle, each of the 5 subsets
was used as a test set once and the rest constituted the training set and a total of 5 such cycles were
performed. Two metrics were employed to quantify the performance of NN_MM-GBSA model
predictions: % correct variant classification (%VC), and the Pearson correlation coefficient
(r). %VC is the percentage of instances in which a variant is classified correctly as increasing or

decreasing the binding affinity compared to WT. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient is defined
as:
𝑟=

∑(𝑥𝑖 − 𝑥̅ )(𝑦𝑖 − 𝑦̅)
√∑(𝑥𝑖 − 𝑥̅ )2 ∑(𝑦𝑖 − 𝑦̅)2

where xi and yi are the target and prediction for the ith sample, and 𝑥̅ and 𝑦̅ are the mean value for
all xi targets and yi predictions.
E. Model Predictions: The NN_MM-GBSA model predictions are based on a single model trained
using 100% of the training data. When making the prediction for a variant, the ensemble of eight
sets of MM-GBSA energies are collected and each set is used to make a single prediction for KD,app
using the model. The median of eight predictions is the final predictor of the KD,app of the variant.
F. Implementation: All codes were developed in Python using the PyTorch library.

Rosetta calculations for Gbind prediction
The complexes for 108 RBD variants were subject to Relax66 with harmonic constraints to prevent
the structure from deviating significantly from the crystal structure. During Relax, rotamers of
amino acid residues within 8 Å of the mutated amino acid were only allowed to repack (local
packing). All default parameters were used for Relax with the ref2015 energy function.49. At the
end of Relax, a gradient minimization is performed using lbfgs_armijo algorithm for 2000 steps
after which the relevant metrics of binding were calculated using InterfaceAnalyzer.91 The binding
energy, Gvariant of each variant is calculated as the average of dG_separated scores obtained from
30 independent Relax simulations. For each variant, a WT binding energy, GWT is calculated
using the same protocol by making a dummy amino acid change (change amino acid to itself).
Finally, the change in binding energy Gbind is calculated as Gbind = Gvariant - GWT.
