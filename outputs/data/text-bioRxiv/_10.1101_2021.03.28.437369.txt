Abstract

Several SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, posing a renewed threat to COVID-19 containment and
to vaccine and drug efficacy. In this study, we analyzed more than 820,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomic
sequences deposited up to March 26, 2021 and identified a novel T478K mutation located on the
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The mutation is structurally located in the region of interaction with
human receptor ACE2 and was detected in 4,214 distinct cases. We show that T478K has appeared
and risen in frequency since January 2021, predominantly in Mexico and North America, but we could
also detect it in several European countries.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological cause of Coronavirus
Disease 19 (COVID-19) is responsible for the most severe pandemic outbreak of the current century
[1]. Naturally, it is the object of unprecedented scientific scrutiny, with more than 800,000 SARS-CoV2 genomic sequences having been generated and publicly shared since December 2019. This
avalanche of data was made possible thanks to the efforts of thousands of contributing laboratories
across the World, and collected by the GISAID initiative database [2]. This currently allows to run
nearly real-time operations of genomic surveillance, by scrutinizing the evolution of the virus
temporally and geographically [3]. In the first 26 months since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2,
genomic surveillance has proven itself fundamental in tracking viral outbreaks [4] and in identifying
potential new variants of clinical concern. One of these is the variant B.1.1.7 [5], characterized by 18
mutations over the reference genomic sequence (NCBI entry NC_045512.2, most notably a mutation
A23063T, causing an aminoacidic change N501Y in the viral Spike protein interaction domain with
human receptor Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) [6]. The interaction with ACE2, a surface
protein expressed in human respiratory epithelial cells, is one of the key mechanisms for viral entry

in the host, and it is a molecular mechanism directly connected with host specificity, early
transmissibility [7] and higher viral infectivity [8].
N501Y is only one of the 9 Spike mutations of variant B.1.1.7, also characterized by mutations in
polyprotein ORF1a, proteins ORF8 and Nucleocapsid (N) [9]. Another mutation in the Spike protein,
D614G, has arisen in early 2020 and is currently present in more than 90% of all circulating SARSCoV-2s; this mutation is not located in the interaction domain with ACE2, but it has been associated
with increased entry efficiency with human host cells [10]. Virtually all variants of concern contain
mutations in the Spike protein, such as variant B.1.351 (Spike mutations K417N, E484K, N501Y,
D614G and A701V) and variants B.1.427/B.1.429 (Spike mutations S13I, W152C, L452R and D614G).
A recently published clinical study [11] has shown a decreased vaccine efficacy against the variant
B.1.351, testifying the need to track and monitor all SARS-CoV-2 mutations, with a particular accent
on those affecting the Spike protein sequence.
In this short Communication, we will show a report on a novel SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutation, T478K,
which is also located at the interface of the Spike/ACE2 interaction, and it is worryingly rising in
prevalence among SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected since the beginning of 2021.

Materials and Methods
We downloaded all publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences from the GISAID database on
March 26, 2021. This yielded 826,572 samples, annotated with features such as collection date,
region of origin, age, and sex of the infected patient. Only viruses collected from human hosts were
kept for further processing, discarding e.g., environmental samples or viruses obtained from other
mammals. We compared all these sequences with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome NC_045512.2,
which provided 16,751,677 mutation events; these nucleotide mutations were then converted in
corresponding cumulative effects on protein sequence using the Coronapp pipeline [12]. The 3D
rendering of the location of S:T478K in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike / Human ACE2 complex was based on
the crystal structure from [13], deposited in the Protein Data Bank [14] entry 6VW1. All statistical
analysis, algorithms and plotting were implemented with the R software [15].

Results
In total, we could detect the Spike:T478K (S:T478K) mutation in 4,214 distinct patients. The majority
of these mutations (3,640 samples, Figure 1A) are associated to variant B.1.1.222, first detected in
Mexico; S:T478K is present in 65.0% of B.1.1.222 cases. The remaining S:T478K events are
distributed in small numbers (N<100) in other lineages phylogenetically not derived from B.1.1.222,
supporting the hypothesis that this mutation has arisen more than once in distinct events. S:T478K
is also present in 70% of the B.1.486 lineage samples, however this clade has currently only 10
reported cases and is therefore of no concern yet.
S:T478K does not seem to be significantly associated with patient age (one way ANOVA test p>0.1,
Figure 1B), nor with patient sex (Figure 1C). The geographic distribution of S:T478K (Figure 1D)
shows a noticeable prevalence in Mexico, where it constitutes 38.1% (1,203 distinct cases) of all
sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We could detect S:T478K mutations in 2,536 samples from the
United States of America, totaling 1.3% of all genomes generated in the country. The S:T478K is
therefore primarily present in North America, but it has been detected also in European countries
such as Germany, Turkey and Switzerland (Figure 1E).
One of the reasons of concern about S:T478K is that it is rapidly growing over time, both in number
of detected samples (Figure 2A) and in prevalence, calculated as number of cases over total number
of sequenced genomes (Figure 2B). We detected this grow starting at the beginning of 2021, and
S:T478K is, at the time of writing (March 26, 2021) characterizing almost 2.0% of all sequenced SARSCoV-2. As a comparison, we show the growth observed for Spike mutations S:N501Y, which rose in
November 2020 (Figure 2C), and S:D614G, which exponentially grew in frequency starting February
2020 (Figure 2D).
The location of S:T478K is within the interaction domain with the human receptor ACE2, roughly
encompassing amino acids 350 to 550 of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. In particular, the position of
S:T478K is on the interface with ACE2, as shown by crystal structures of the complex (Figure 2E).
S:T478K is frequently co-occurring with three other Spike mutations located outside the canonical
ACE2 interaction region. One is D614G (99.8% co-occurrence), one of the founding events of SARSCoV-2 lineage B.*, currently the most diffused Worldwide. The other two are P681H and T732A, with
95.2% and 91.4% co-occurrence with S:T478K, respectively (Table 1). We could detect S:T478K in
co-presence with other Spike mutations as well, but currently all at much lower frequencies (<5%).
The Spike S:T478K mutation is frequently co-existing also with mutations in other proteins, such as

the diffused two-aa Nucleocapsid mutation N:RG203KR, and mutations in Non-Structural Proteins
(NSPs) derived from the polyprotein encoded ORF1 (Open Reading Frame), which include for
example the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NSP12 (Table 2).

Discussion
In this short communication, we report the distribution of the Spike mutation S:T478K and its recent
growth in prevalence in the SARS-CoV-2 population. While there is currently no report of association
of this variant with clinical features, S:T478K’s rapid growth may indicate an increased adaption of
SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying it, particularly lineage B.1.1.222. The distribution of this mutation is
higher in North America [16], but we could detect it also in several European countries. The location
of S:T478K in the interaction complex with human ACE2 may affect the affinity with human cells and
therefore influence viral infectivity. An in silico molecular dynamics study on the protein structure of
Spike has predicted that the T478K mutation, substituting a non-charged amino acid (Threonine)
with a positive one (Lysine) may significantly alter the electrostatic surface of the protein, and
therefore the interaction with ACE2, drugs or antibodies [17], and that the effect can be increased if
combined by other co-occurring Spike mutations (see Table 1). Another experiment showed that
T478K and T478R mutants were enriched when SARS-CoV-2 viral cultures were tested against weak
neutralizing antibodies [18], highlighting, at least in vitro, a possible genetic route the virus can follow
to escape immune recognition. Everything considered, we believe that the continued genetical and
clinical monitoring of S:T478K and other Spike mutations is of paramount importance to better
understand COVID-19 and be able to better counteract its future developments.
