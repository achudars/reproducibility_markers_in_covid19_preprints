Abstract

16

To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of PCR tests are performed worldwide. Any

17

deviation of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity will reduce the predictive values of the test.

18

Here, we report the occurrence of contaminations of commercial primers/probe sets with the

19

SARS-CoV-2 target sequence of the RT-qPCR as an example for pitfalls during PCR diagnostics

20

affecting diagnostic specificity. In several purchased in-house primers/probe sets, quantification

21

cycle values as low as 17 were measured for negative control samples. However, there were also

22

primers/probe sets that displayed very low-level contaminations, which were detected only

23

during thorough internal validation. Hence, it appears imperative to pre-test each batch of

24

reagents extensively before use in routine diagnosis, to avoid false-positive results and low

25

positive predictive value in low-prevalence situations. As such, contaminations may have

26

happened more widely, COVID-19 diagnostic results should be re-assessed retrospectively to

27

validate the epidemiological basis for control measures.

Introduction
In December 2019, an outbreak of an unexplained acute respiratory disease of humans

32

was reported in Wuhan, China (WHO, 2020d). As causative agent of the disease now named

33

COVID-19, a novel betacoronavirus referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

34

2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV) was identified (Zhu et al., 2020). COVID-19

35

rapidly evolved into a global pandemic (WHO, 2020b) resulting in millions of infections and

36

several hundred thousands of deaths. Overall, about 20 % of the symptomatic infections are

37

severe or critical, with much higher rates in the elderly or when certain underlying health

38

conditions exist (WHO, 2020b). However, also asymptomatic infections occur and it is estimated

39

that virus transmission from asymptomatic humans accounts for about half of all COVID-19

40

cases (He et al., 2020), which might be particularly critical when asymptomatically infected

41

health care workers transmit the virus in hospitals or care homes for the elderly.

42

Diagnosis is currently based primarily on real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) using nasal or

43

throat swabs. To identify and isolate infected individuals, thereby interrupting transmission

44

chains, millions of RT-qPCR tests are carried out (Hasell et al., 2020). With such a large number

45

of diagnostic tests and yet low prevalences of infected humans, it is of utmost importance to

46

ensure a high level of quality management in the testing laboratories to guarantee an optimal and

47

reliable diagnostic accuracy. Any deviation of the diagnostic specificity of the PCRs, e.g.

48

through contamination of reagents with target sequences, mix-up or cross-contamination of

49

samples will significantly reduce the positive predictive value of the test. Here, we report

50

contamination of commercial primers and probes with oligonucleotides as an example for pitfalls

51

during PCR diagnostics with a drastic effect on diagnostic specificity. This example emphasizes

52

the need for continuous and comprehensive quality management in all diagnostics steps.

This study
For the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genome, two real-time PCRs listed on the website of

55

the World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO, 2020a) were established and validated in our

56

laboratory. To increase the diagnostic accuracy, systems targeting different genomic regions

57

were selected. The first assay (“E-Sarbeco”) is based on the E gene coding region (Corman et al.,

58

2020) and the second assay (“nCoV_IP4”) targets the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)

59

gene (WHO, 2020a). To control for efficient RNA extraction and amplification, both assays were

60

combined with an internal control system based on the housekeeping gene beta-actin (Wernike et

61

al., 2011). Primers and probes were ordered from four different commercial companies in March

62

and April 2020, amongst them major oligonucleotide suppliers on the European market. Both

63

duplex SARS-CoV-2/beta actin real-time PCR systems were validated using two different real-

64

time PCR kits, namely the AgPath-ID™ One-Step RT-PCR kit and the SuperScript III One Step

65

RT-PCR kit (both produced by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) to increase flexibility in case

66

of supply shortage.

67

As part of our internal quality management, each batch of primers/probe is investigated

68

regarding its sensitivity and specificity using SARS-CoV-2 RNA and negative samples

69

(phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or nuclease-free water) before the oligonucleotides are applied

70

in routine diagnosis. During these pre-tests, the first primers/probe sets from supplier A

71

purchased in March 2020 (set A-1) performed as expected. However, subsequently, very high

72

genome loads were found in some newly purchased E-Sarbeco primers/probe sets. Quantification

73

cycle (Cq) values as low as ~17 or ~22 were measured in negative control samples (table 1)

74

indicating a high level of contamination in reagents obtained from some oligonucleotide

75

suppliers. While the problems in performance are obvious in these cases, there were also

76

primers/probe sets that displayed contaminations only at lower levels. As an example, when we

77

used a separate batch of oligonucleotides from supplier A (set A-2), only two out of 27 negative

78

control samples reacted weakly positive. To exclude the PCR chemistry or the internal control

79

oligonucleotides as potential sources of the false-positive results, samples from the first German

80

proficiency test on COVID-19 diagnostics (INSTAND e. V. and GBD Gesellschaft für

81

Biotechnologische Diagnostik mbH) as well as seven negative RNA isolation controls (RIC

82

= PBS) were tested using the incriminated primers/probes in combination with two different

83

batches of both RT-PCR kits. Every combination, in which the first set of primers/probe was

84

applied, yielded correct results, while the incriminated primers/probe (set A-2) resulted in several

85

false-positive results regardless of the applied PCR chemistry (figure 1). Hence, the primers or

86

the probe were the cause of the false-positive reactions, a phenomenon that seems to occur

87

frequently (table 1). The main reason for the wide distribution of contaminated primers or probes

88

may be the simultaneous production of long oligonucleotides containing SARS-CoV-2 target

89

sequences for real-time RT-PCRs. Especially during the first phase of the establishment and

90

internal validation of SARS-CoV-2 specific real-time RT-PCRs, such oligonucleotides have

91

been widely used as positive controls and were produced by many primer/probe suppliers

92

(Mögling et al., 2020).

93

To investigate the impact of the low-level primer/probe contamination on the diagnostic

94

specificity, 41 human throat swabs were tested with the different primers/probe sets A-1, A-2,

95

A-3, and B. Swabs were collected in 1 ml PBS and total nucleic acid extracted from this swab

96

medium either manually (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini, Qiagen, Germany; extraction volume

97

140 µl) or automated (NucleoMag VET kit, MACHERY-NAGEL GmbH & Co. KG, Germany;

98

extraction volume 100 µl). To exclude nonspecific reactions, which could be caused by other

99

human coronaviruses potentially present in the throat swab samples, 47 oral or nasal swabs of

100

bovine origin (taken before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic) were included. These specimens

101

represented routine submissions to the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute for

102

Animal Health, or originated from an unrelated animal trial (Wernike et al., 2018). Positive

103

predictive values were calculated using EpiTools

104

(https://epitools.ausvet.com.au/predictivevalues).

105

All human and bovine swab samples scored negative by the nCoV_IP4 assay and the first

106

E-Sarbeco primers/probe set delivered at the 25th of March 2020 (set A-1) (table 1). However,

107

when tested by the oligonucleotides A-2, A-3 and B, a total of 13, five and seven of the negative

108

samples scored positive, respectively. Since the empty control (NTC = nuclease free water),

109

which was included in the PCR runs, reacted negatively as expected, the PCRs would have been

110

considered valid during routine diagnostics. Thus, the samples would have been incorrectly

111

diagnosed as positive in settings, where no cut-off for positivity is defined.

112

If we assume a best-case scenario for specificity based on these results for the A-3 or B /

113

E-Sarbeco setting, the diagnostic specificity was calculated as 0.9756 (40/41; table 1). In

114

calendar week 14 of 2020, 36,885 out of 408,348 samples (9.0%) tested positive in Germany

115

(Robert-Koch-Institut, 2020). Under these conditions, the positive predictive value of the test

116

system was 0.802, i.e. almost 20% of the positive results would have been false-positive. In

117

calendar week 19, 10,187 out of 382,154 samples (2.7%) tested positive. In this scenario, a test

118

system with a diagnostic specificity of 0.9756 had resulted in a positive predictive value of

119

0.5319, i.e. almost half of the positive results would have been false-positive. Obviously, any

120

further reduction of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections will result in decrease of the

121

positive predictive value if the specificity of the employed assays is not dramatically increased.

122

Not only in-house PCRs need to be thoroughly validated in every laboratory, but also

123

commercial kits (Rahman et al., 2020), as they may contain similar primer/probe mixes and

124

produce incorrectly positive results, which will also result in a low positive predictive value.

125

As an additional component of quality assurance, the preparation of small sample pools

126

might be considered in areas or scenarios with low prevalences (e.g. among asymptomatic

127

persons), which conserves resources and increases sample throughput (Abdalhamid et al., 2020,

128

Eis-Hübinger et al., 2020, Yelin et al., 2020). Most importantly, when such a pool scores

129

positive, all samples need to be re-tested individually, where at least one individual sample

130

should result in the same or a higher virus load than the sample pool itself. In the case of

131

contaminations as described above, the pool will show implausible results during follow-up

132

testing markedly increasing the diagnostic specificity. The WHO recommends widespread

133

testing to combat the COVID-19 pandemic (WHO, 2020b). However, the capacity of SARS-

134

CoV-2 for explosive spread has not only overwhelmed weaker health systems, but also

135

challenges diagnostic capacities (Hasell et al., 2020, WHO, 2020b). Where testing capacity

136

cannot meet the needs, even a prioritization of testing has to be implemented (European

137

Commission, 2020, WHO, 2020c). In such settings of limited resources, pooling of samples

138

might be an option for the serial screening of e.g. asymptomatic health care workers, which is

139

highly recommended to prevent nosocomial transmission of the virus (Rivett et al., 2020). Here,

140

the samples of the German proficiency test (INSTAND e. V. and GBD Gesellschaft für

141

Biotechnologische Diagnostik mbH) were tested in pools consisting of the respective ring trial

142

sample and four negative human throat swabs. The values obtained from the pools were about

143

2.2 Cq higher than the values of the respective individual samples, but the final assessment was

144

always correct, i.e. each positive sample was correctly identified (figure 2). While there is

145

undoubtedly a (minor) decrease in analytical sensitivity, the pooling option needs to be carefully

146

considered in the light of the current epidemiological situation, as every positive pool needs to be

147

dissolved anyway to test the samples individually. Nevertheless, to screen certain groups, in

148

which the expected prevalence of positive samples is low, pooling might be a resource- and cost-

149

effective option with a minimal loss of diagnostic sensitivity, but with an increase in diagnostic

150

specificity.

151
152
153

Conclusions
To ensure a high level of diagnostic accuracy, it is highly recommended to pre-test each

154

batch of PCR reagents thoroughly before applying it in routine diagnosis using more than 50

155

negative samples for specificity testing. Furthermore, it is of utmost importance to include also a

156

reasonable number of appropriate controls such as NTCs, negative extraction controls and

157

positive controls in every PCR run to minimize the risk of incorrect results further. Additional

158

external quality assessment of the analytical results could be achieved by the participation in

159

interlaboratory proficiency trials (FAO, 2015). Finally, in well-validated PCR-workflows,

160

pooling of up to five samples might be an option for expanding capacities especially for the

161

routine testing of low prevalences groups without any COVID-19-specific symptoms.
