Current approaches of drugs repurposing against 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
have not proven overwhelmingly successful and the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to cause major global mortality.
Daclatasvir (DCV) and sofosbuvir (SFV) are clinically approved against hepatitis C virus
(HCV), with satisfactory safety profile. DCV and SFV target the HCV enzymes NS5A and
NS5B, respectively. NS5A is endowed with pleotropic activities, which overlap with several
proteins from SARS-CoV-2. HCV NS5B and SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 are RNA polymerases
that share homology in the nucleotide uptake channel. We thus tested whether SARS-COV2 would be susceptible these anti-HCV drugs. DCV consistently inhibited the production of
infectious SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells, in the hepatoma cell line (HuH-7) and in type II
pneumocytes (Calu-3), with potencies of 0.8, 0.6 and 1.1 µM, respectively. Although less
potent than DCV, SFV and its nucleoside metabolite inhibited replication in Calu-3 cells.
Moreover, SFV/DCV combination (1:0.15 ratio) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 of 0.7:0.1
µM in Calu-3 cells. SFV and DCV prevented virus-induced neuronal apoptosis and release
of cytokine storm-related inflammatory mediators, respectively. Both drugs inhibited
independent events during RNA synthesis and this was particularly the case for DCV, which
also targeted secondary RNA structures in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Concentrations
required for partial DCV in vitro activity are achieved in plasma at Cmax after administration
of the approved dose to humans. Doses higher than those approved may ultimately be
required, but these data provide a basis to further explore these agents as COVID-19 antiviral
candidates.

In these two decades of the 21st century, life-threatening public health emergencies
were related to highly pathogenic coronaviruses (CoV), such as severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS-CoV) in 2002, middle-east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2014[1]
and SARS-CoV-2 contemporaneously. After 8 months of the 2019 CoV disease (COVID19) outbreak, 15 million cases and over 750 thousand deaths were confirmed[2].

To specifically combat COVID-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched
the global Solidarity trial, initially composed of lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV), combined
or not with interferon-β (IFN-β), chloroquine (CQ) and remdesivir (RDV) [3]. Lack of
clinical benefit paused the enthusiasm for CQ, its analogue hydroxychloroquine and
LPV/RTV against COVID-19[4–6]. RDV showed promising results in non-human primates
and clinical studies during early intervention[5,7,8]. Nevertheless, RDV’s access may be
limited due to its price, and the necessity of intravenous use makes early intervention
impracticable and complicates feasibility within many healthcare settings.

Direct-acting antivirals (DDA) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) are among the safest
antiviral agents, since they become routinely used in the last five years[9]. Due to their recent
incorporation among therapeutic agents, drugs like daclatasvir (DCV) and sofosbuvir (SFV)
have not been systematically tested against SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.

DCV inhibits HCV replication by binding to the N-terminus of non-structural protein
(NS5A), affecting both viral RNA replication and virion assembly[10]. NS5A is a
multifunctional protein in the HCV replicative cycle, involved with recruitment of host
cellular lipid droplets, RNA binding and replication, protein-phosphorylation, cell signaling
and antagonism of interferon pathways[10]. In large positive sense RNA viruses, such as
SARS-CoV-2, these activities are executed by various viral proteins, especially the nonstructural proteins (nsp) 1 to 14[11]. SFV inhibits the HCV protein NS5B, its RNA
polymerase[12]. This drug has been associated with antiviral activity against other positive
sense RNA viruses, such as Zika (ZIKV), yellow fever (YFV) and chikungunya (CHIKV)
viruses [13–16].
With respect to HCV, SFV appears to have a high barrier to the
development of resistance. SFV is 2`Me-F uridine monophosphate nucleotide[12].
Hydrophobic protections in its phosphate allow SFV to enter the cells, and then this pro-drug
must become the active triphosphorylated nucleotide. Although the cellular enzymes
cathepsin A (CatA), carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein
1 (Hint1) involved with removal of monophosphate protections are classically associated
with the hepatic expression[17], they are also present in other tissue, such as the respiratory
tract [18–20]. Moreover, the similarities between the SARS-CoV-2 and HCV RNA
polymerase provide a rational for studying sofosbuvir as an antiviral for COVID-19 [21].
Using enzymatic assays, sofosbuvir was shown to act as a competitive inhibitor and a chain
terminator for SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase[22,23]. In human brain organoids, SFV
protected neural cells from SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death [24].

Taken collectively, current data provided a bases to investigate whether DCV and
SFV could inhibit the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in physiologically

relevant cells. DCV consistently inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in
different cells, impairing virus RNA synthesis with an apparently novel mechanism of action,
by targeting double-stranded viral RNA. DCV also prevented the release of the inflammatory
mediators IL-6 and TNF-α, which are associated with COVID-19 cytokine storm, in SARSCoV-2-infected primary human monocytes. SFV, which was inactive in Vero cells, inhibited
SARS-CoV-2 replication more potently in hepatoma than in respiratory cells. Furthermore,
SFV potency appeared to be augmented in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of
DCV. These data support further investigation of DCV/SFV for COVID-19. Of interest,
concentrations providing sub-maximal inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by DCV are achieved in
plasma at maximal concentration (Cmax) after administration of its approved dose of 60mg
once daily, which has considerable scope for dose escalation.

SARS-CoV-2 may infect cell lineages from different organs, but permissive
production of infectious virus particles varies according to the cellular systems. Since we
wanted to diminish infectious virus titers with studied antiviral drugs, we first compared cell
types used in SARS-CoV-2 research with respect to their permissiveness to this virus.
Whereas African green monkey kidney cell (Vero E6), human hepatoma (HuH-7) and type
II pneumocytes (Calu-3) produced infectious SARS-CoV-2 titers and quantifiable RNA
levels (Figure S1), A549 pneumocytes and induced pluripotent human neural stem cells
(NSC) displayed limited ability to generate virus progeny, as measured by plaque forming
units (PFU) of virus bellow the limit of detection (Figure S1A).
Next, the phenotypic experiments were performed at MOI of 0.01 for Vero cells 24h after
infection, and 0.1 for HuH-7 and Calu-3 cells at 48h after infection. Cultures were treated
after 1h infection period and cell culture supernatant fractions were harvested to measure
infectious SARS-CoV-2 by plaque forming units (PFUs) in Vero cells. DCV consistently
inhibited the production of SARS-CoV-2 infectious virus titers in a dose-dependent manner
in the all tested cell types (Figure 1), being similarly potent in Vero, HuH-7 and Calu-3 cells,
with EC50 values ranging between 0.6 to 1.1 µM, without statistical distinction (Table 1).
DCV showed limited antiviral activity when viral RNA copies/mL in the culture supernatant
fraction (Figures S2) was utilized, suggesting a mechanism unrelated to RNA production.
SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to SFV in Huh-7 and Calu-3 cells was lower compared
to DCV(Figure 1B and D and Table 1). Because vero cells poorly activate SFV to its active
triphosphate, SFV did not affect SARS-CoV-2 replication in these cells. Similarly, to what
was observed for DCV, quantification of SFV’s antiviral activity by PFUs was more sensitive
than by viral RNA quantification in the supernatant fraction (Figure S2). DCV was at least
7-times more potent than SFV in HuH-7 and Calu-3 cells (Table 1).
SFV’s nucleoside metabolite (GS-331007) was also tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2
activity. GS-331007 was inactive in Vero cells and less active than SFV in Huh-7 cells

(Figure 1 and Table 1). Curiously, in respiratory cells, GS-331007 presented a moderate antiSARS-CoV-2 activity, similar to that of SFV (Figure 1 and Table 1).
Given that SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells appeared to be more sensitive to
antiviral activity, this cell line was used to assess the combination of SFV and DCV.
SFV/DCV combination was used at a ratio of 1:0.15 ratio, in accordance with its dose ratio
for HCV-positive patients (400 mg SFV plus 60 mg DCV). In this assessment of the
interaction, the potency of SFV increased 10-fold in the presence of suboptimal DCV
concentrations (Figure 1C and E and Table 1).
DCV was demonstrated to be 1.1- to 4-fold more potent than the positive controls
CQ, LPV/RTV and ribavirin (RBV) (Figures 1 and Table 1), whereas SFV potency was
similar to that of RBV in HuH-7 and Calu-3 cells (Figures 1 and Table 1). However, the
selectivity index (SI = CC50/EC50) for SFV was 4.6-fold superior to RBV, because of SFV`s
lower cytotoxicity (Table 1). None of the studied drugs were more potent than RDV (Figure
1 and Table 1).
These data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to DCV and SFV in vitro,
with a higher potency demonstrated for DCV.
2.2) Protective effect of SFV and DCV in non-permissive cells
Although productive replication in neurons and monocytes was not observed (Figure
S1), infection of these cells is known to be associated with neuro-COVID-19[25] and
cytokine storm[26], respectively. Therefore, these cell types may be important targets for
repurposed antiviral drugs.
SFV reduced SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels by 20 - 40% in NSCs, at a concentration of 1
µM (Figure 2A). Conversely, no impact of DCV on SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels were observed
in NSC (Figure 2A), consistently with the other cell types assayed (Figure S2). Using the
more complex system of NSC-based neurospheres, the number of tunel-positive nuclei over
total nuclei as a proxy of apoptotic cells was assessed. SFV completely prevented SARSCoV-2-induced apoptosis (Figure 2B), whereas benefits of DCV in this system were limited.
In SARS-CoV-2-infected human primary monocytes, 1 µM DCV reduced viral RNA
levels/cell (Figure 3A), whereas SFV was inactive. DCV also reduced the SARS-CoV-2induced enhancement of TNF-α and IL-6 (Figure 3B and C). These data provide further
evidence for a putative benefit in COVID-19 with the investigated HCV DDAs if target
concentrations can be achieved in patients.
SFV and DCV cooperatively target virus replication in cells from different anatomical
sites, preventing SARS-CoV-2-mediated neuronal cell death and the increase of proinflammatory mediators.
2.3) DCV and SFV may target different events during SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis.
The observation that suboptimal concentrations of DCV augmented antiviral activity
of SFV (Figure 1C and F) may indicate that they target different processes during viral
replication. As a nucleotide analog, SFV was described to competitively inhibit the SARSCoV-2 RNA polymerase[22]. In HCV, DCV blocks the multi-functional protein NS5A, also
suggesting these agents target different mechanisms within the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. To
gain insights on the temporality of DCV`s activity against SARS-CoV-2, Vero cells were

infected at MOI of 0.01 and treated at different timepoints, with DCV at 2-fold its EC50. This
time-of-addition assay demonstrated that DCV treatment could be efficiently postponed up
to 4 h, similarly to RBV, a pan-RNA polymerase inhibitor (Figure 4A). These results suggest
that inhibition of viral RNA synthesis is the limiting event targeted by DCV.
To confirm the rational that both SFV and DCV inhibit viral RNA synthesis in
physiologically relevant cells, intracellular levels of SARS-CoV-2 genomic and subgenomic
RNA were measured in type II pneumocytes, Calu-3 cells. A two-fold higher inhibition of
viral RNA synthesis was observed for DCV compared to SFV (Figure 4B), when both were
tested at 10 µM. SFV/DCV cooperatively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis, even at
1µM, also supporting different targets for each agent during replicase activity.
Molecular docking methods were applied to predict the complexes with lowest energy
interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase and the active metabolite of SFV
as well as DCV. The SFV active metabolite and DCV presented rerank score values of -74.09
a.u. and -84.64 a.u., respectively. In addition, the hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), attractive
electrostatic, and steric interactions were mapped using a ligand-map algorithm[27]. The SFV
active metabolite was predict to interact via hydrogen bonds (H-bond) with Arg553, Cys622,
Asp623, and Asn691 residues and with U20 RNA nucleotide (H-bond interaction energy = 3.50 u.a.), also presenting electrostatic interactions with Lys551, Arg553, and with the two
Mg2+ ions (electrostatic interaction energy = -13.14 u.a.), as described by Gao coworkers[21],
and steric interactions with Arg553, Cys622, Asp623, and Asn691 residues (steric interaction
energy = -74.09 u.a.) (Figure 5A and C). Furthermore, these predictions indicated that DCV
may interact with viral RNA in the cleft of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase (Figure 5B
and D), with anchoring through H-bonds with Tyr546 and Thr687 residues, and with U9
RNA nucleotide (H-bond interaction energy = 3.68 u.a.), and also showing steric interactions
with Tyr546 and Thr687 residues (steric interaction energy = -84.64 u.a.) (Figure 5B and D).
2.4) DCV effect on SARS-CoV-2 RNA
Predictions from molecular modeling and data from in vitro phenotypic assays
suggested that DCV could target SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis. Therefore, a melting curve
of extracted viral RNA was generated to assess whether DCV could affect the virus RNA
folding. SARS-CoV-2 RNA displays secondary structures throughout its sequence, which
are important during viral replication and trascription [28], which can be monitored through
melting curve analysis using a regular real time thermocycler. The thermal melting profiles
of the RNA and RNA/DCV complexes, obtained by varying the temperature, showed
concentration-dependent effects favoring denaturation of the nucleic acid at low temperatures
(Figure 6A and B).
In order to investigate further, it was hypothesized that continuous culture of the virus
in the presence do DCV may result in mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA which change the
pattern of secondary structure. Following two months successive passage of the virus in Vero
cells at the MOI of 0.1 in the presence of increasing concentrations, a 30% mutant
subpopulation was detected in the presence of 7 µM DCV (Figure 6C). A putative secondary
structure at positions 28169-28259 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was changed in the mutant
virus (yielded in the presence of DCV) in comparison to wild-type (SARS-CoV-2 virus
grown in parallel without treatment) (Table 2, Figure 6D and E, genbank #MT827075,

located at the junction between ORF8 and N gene; thus, the change in the shape of the
secondary RNA structure may prevent the binding of specific components required for the
transcription of these genes (Figure 6D and E). Moreover, the low sequence identity of the
mutant with SARS-CoV-2 genomes in genbank suggests that it may be unlikely that mutant
virus possesses adequate fitness (Table 2), which is in line with the observed reduction in
virus infectious titers.

PBPK model validation against various single and multiple oral doses of DCV had a ratio
<2 between mean simulated and observed values and a summary of this shown in
supplementary tables S1 and 2. The average absolute fold error (AAFE) values for the
observed vs simulated plasma concentration – time curve for a single 100 mg dose and
multiple 60 mg OD doses were 0.92 and 0.76, respectively, and are shown in supplementary

range for the DCV PBPK model to assumed as validated.

Supplementary figures S6 and S7 show the C24 values for various BID and TID dose
simulations, and 540 mg BID and 330 mg TID were shown to satisfy systemic concentrations
above the EC90 for at least 90% of the simulated population. Optimal dose was identified to
be 330 mg TID as this dosing regimen requires lower dose per day than 540 mg BID. A
comparison between 60 mg TID and 330 mg TID daclatasvir is shown in Figure 7 that satisfy
C24 for EC50 (0.8 µM, 591 ng/ml) and EC90 respectively for treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

2.5) Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling for DCV
A recent analysis of drugs proposed for repurposing as SARS-CoV-2 antiviral medicines
revealed that very few of the proposed candidates achieved their target concentrations after
administration of approved doses to humans [29]. Moreover, there have been several recent
calls to integrate understanding of pharmacokinetic principles into COVID-19 drug
prioritization[30–32]. Initial assessment of the plasma pharmacokinetics of SFV indicated
that the concentrations able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro were unlikely to be
achievable after approved doses. However, inhibitory DCV concentrations were close to
those achieved following administration of its approved HCV dose. Therefore,
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling was used to estimate the dose and
schedule of this drug to maximize the probability of success for COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present a major concern to global health, and is
the most significant economic threat in decades[33]. Less than 8 months after the outbreak
in Wuhan, China, the WHO recorded more 750,000 deaths worldwide 1. SARS-CoV-2 is the
third highly pathogenic coronavirus that emerged in the two decades of the 21st century,
following SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV[1]. SARS-CoV-2 actively replicates in type II
pneumocytes, leading to cytokine storm and the exacerbation of thrombotic
pathways[26,34,35]. Besides the virus-triggered pneumonia and sepsis-like disease
associated with severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 may reach the central nervous system[25]
and liver[36]. Early blockage of the natural clinical evolution of infection by antivirals will
likely prevent the disease progression to severe COVID-19[26,34,35]. Indeed, clinical
studies providing early antiviral intervention accelerated the decline of viral loads and slowed
disease progression[7,8]. The decrease of viral loads is likely to be a critical laboratory
parameter, because lowering viral shedding may protect the individual and reduced
transmissibility is likely to have population-level benefits.

To rapidly respond to unfolding pandemics, the cataloguing of preclinical data on
susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to approved drugs is of paramount importance, and provides
opportunities for rational selection of promising products for evaluation in clinical trials [37].
The investigators used this approach during ZIKV, YFV, and CHIKV outbreak in Brazil, and
demonstrated susceptibility of these viruses to SFV [13–16,38]. SFV and DCV are
considered safe and well tolerated anti-HCV therapies that are orally bioavailable. The
presented work demonstrates: i) SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to DCV, ii) DCV/SFV cotreatment show cooperative antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication in respiratory cells;
iii) SFV and DCV prevented virus-induced neuronal apoptosis and release of cytokine stormrelated mediators in monocytes, respectively; iv) DCV and SFV inhibited independent events
during RNA synthesis; v) DCV favors the unfold of SARS-CoV-2 secondary RNA
structures, and vi) target concentration of DCV set by the in vitro activities are within the
range that may be achievable in humans.

In the 9.6 kb genome of HCV, the gene ns5a encodes for a multifunctional protein. The
protein NS5A possesses motifs involved with lipid, zinc and RNA binding, phosphorylation
and interaction with cell signaling events[10]. In other viruses, with less compact genomes,
the functions and motifs present in NS5A are distributed to other proteins. For instance, in
SARS-CoV-2, its 29 kb genome encodes for nsp3, with zinc motif; nsp4 and 5, with lipidic
binding activity; nsp7, 8, 12, 13 and 14 able to bind RNA[11]. Although there is not a specific
orthologue of NS5A in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, their activities may be exerted by multiple
other proteins. DCV inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 titers with EC50
values ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 µM across different cell types, including pneumocytes.
Curiously, DCV`s antiviral activity was not exhibited when virus replication was accessed
by quantifying viral RNA loads. Our sub-sequential analysis illustrated that DCV mechanism
of action could be, at least in part, associated with targeting viral RNA secondary structures,
in line with the observation of lower infectivity in the absence of viral RNA decline in culture
supernatant. SARS-CoV-2 possesses RNA pseudoknots that could contribute to the

viral RNA polymerase activity. This already impaired catalysis may promote cooperative
activity of SFV.

With relevance to SFV, the homology of the new-2019-CoV and HCV orthologue
enzyme were confirmed [21]. In enzyme kinetic assays with SARS-CoV-2 nsp7, 8 and 12,
the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase complex, SFV-triphosphate, the active metabolite,
competitively acts as a chain terminator[22,23]. Similarly, RBV-, favipiravir- and RDVtriphosphate also target SARS-CoV-2 RNA elongation[22,23]. Indeed, SFV reduced the
RNA synthesis in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells able to convert the pro-drug to its active
triphosphate, such as hepatoma cells. This activation process requires a multi-stage pathway
in which hydrophobic protections in the SFV monophosphate are removed by the cellular
enzymes CatA, CES1 and HINT, with subsequent followed by engagement of nucleoside
monophosphate and diphosphate kinase [17]. According to the Human Protein Atlas, these
enzymatic entities are also found in the respiratory tract[18–20]. Indeed, we found that
SARS-CoV-2 replication could be inhibited by SFV at high concentration, not only in
hepatoma cells – but also in Calu-3 type II pneumocytes. Interestingly, RDV, which shares
structural characteristics with SFV, such as to be converted from the ProTide/prodrug to
active metabolite, is active in the respiratory tract[39]. Moreover, there is a body of evidence
suggesting that the ProTide phospharamidate protections would be dispensable from RDV in
respiratory cells because the nucleoside analog, GS-441524, is active against human and
feline CoV [39–41]. Since there are open questions on the efficiency in which respiratory
cells convert nucleosides to nucleotides, the nucleoside version of SFV (GS-331007) was
tested against SARS-CoV-2. GS-331007 was virtually inactive in all cell, types except for
Calu-3, in which it exerted similar activity to SFV. Importantly, GS-331007 has broader
distribution in anatomical compartments than SFV, which may be important in the context
of anatomical target-site activity.

Considering that DCV could favor RNA denaturation, conformational changes in the
viral RNA template/primer dimer at nsp12 active site may limit efficiency or processing by
this enzyme. Since SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase kinetics is impaired by DCV, SFV could
be less impacted by hindrance via amino acid Asp623[22] in this enzyme. This hypothesis
warrants further investigation to confirm the mechanistic-basis for the possible cooperation
between SFV and DCV in vitro model, and clinically if observations from recent trials are
confirmed[42].

SFV was able to prevent apoptosis in human neurons, whereas DCV prevented the
enhancement of IL-6 and TNF-α levels in human monocytes. These secondary mechanisms
may also support cooperativity between SFV and DCV, because neurological SARS-CoV-2
infection and cytokine storm are associated with poor clinical outcomes[25,26]. Another
study also reported that SFV could be protective against neuro-COVID in vitro[24].
However, the authors analyzed only a single dose of 20 µM, which greatly exceeds the
concentrations achieved by SFV after approved dosing to humans [17]. Here,
neuroprotection is demonstrated to be promoted by SFV at 1 µM, which is closer to
physiological concentrations [17].

Based upon targets set by the in vitro pharmacological activity of DCV, PBPK modelling
indicated that systemic concentrations able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 may be achievable in
humans. Dose escalation may be needed to provide fully suppressive concentrations across
the entire dosing interval, as has been shown to be needed for other viruses. However, the
validity of such an approach would require careful assessment of safety and tolerability
through phase I evaluation of the higher doses. Furthermore, the prerequisite
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships for successful anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity
are yet to be unraveled, and will likely require better understanding of the target-site
penetration and free drug concentrations in matrices that recapitulate relevant compartments.
Notwithstanding, the approved dose of DCV (60mg OD) is low in relationship to other
antiviral agents, and the PBPK model provides posologies that may be reachable in doseescalation trials.

In summary, effective early antiviral interventions are urgently required for the SARSCoV-2 pandemic to improve patient clinical outcomes and disrupt transmission at population
level. The presented data for two widely available anti-HCV drugs, particularly for DCV,
provide a rational basis for further validation of these molecules for anti-SARS-CoV-2
interventions.

were selected using the rerank scoring function and, then, analyzed also using MVD.

DCV whole-body PBPK model was constructed in Python 3.5 (in PyCharm 20.1.2
(Communtiy edition) using packages – numpy v1.18.5, scipy v1.0.1 and matplotlib v2.1.2)
which consists of various compartments representing all the organs and tissues of the body.
The drug physicochemical parameters for daclatasvir were presented in supplementary table
S1 obtained from various literature sources. The PBPK model was constructed based on few
assumptions: 1) uniform and instant distribution across a given tissue, 2) no reabsorption
from the colon and 3) the model was blood-flow limited. The simulated data in humans is
computer generated, therefore no ethical approval was required for this study.

The model was simulated using a population of one hundred virtual healthy
individuals (50% female) between 20-60 years and having weight and height as provided by
the US national health statistics reports[46]. Organ weights and volumes, blood flow rates
were obtained using anthropometric equations from literature[47,48] and the characteristics
such as weight and height from US statistics[46]. A seven compartmental absorption and
transit model representing the various parts of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum to capture
effective absorption kinetics was used in the model. The drug was assumed to have entire
administered dose in solution for absorption and completely depend on the rate kinetics
involved during this process. Effective permeability of daclatasvir was scaled from apparent
permeability from PAMPA (due to lack of available data, it was assumed the same in Caco2 cells) using the in vitro – in vivo extrapolation[49,50] to compute the absorption rate from
the small intestine.

The volume of distribution was computed using the tissue to plasma ratios computed
from Rogers & Rowland [51] and a tissue to plasma partition factor (Kp factor) of 0.025 was
used to adjust the volume of distribution to the literature value of 47 L[52]. A population of
100 individuals was simulated by varying the mean values with available standard deviation
for each of the parameters in the model such that every simulation represents a unique
individual.

DCV PBPK model was validated in healthy individuals using available data in
humans for various single doses – 1, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg and for various multiple
doses – 1, 10, 30 and 60 mg at fasted state. Clinical data was digitised using Web Plot
Digitiser® software from available plots. The model was considered validated when: 1)
closeness of the simulated points to the literature data computed using absolute average fold
error (AAFE) between the simulated and observed plasma concentration – time points was
less than two; and 2) the mean simulated pharmacokinetic parameters - maximum
concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were
less than two-fold from mean observed values.

For the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, a mean target concentration (EC90) of 4.12 µM or
3079 ng/ml obtained from multiple in vitro studies was used [53]. Optimal dosing regimen
for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 was identified from various BID and TID dosing regimens
such that at least 90% of the simulated population have trough plasma concentration at 24 h
(C24) over the mean target concentration with a low overall total dose per day.

Experimental procedures involving human cells from healthy donors were performed
with samples obtained after written informed consent and were approved by the Institutional
Review Board (IRB) of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation/Fiocruz (Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil)
under the number 397-07. The National Review Board approved the study protocol (CONEP
30650420.4.1001.0008), and informed consent was obtained from all participants or patients’
representatives.

The assays were performed blinded by one professional, codified and then read by
another professional. All experiments were carried out at least three independent times,
including a minimum of two technical replicates in each assay. The dose-response curves
used to calculate EC50 and CC50 values were generated by variable slope plot from Prism
GraphPad software 8.0. The equations to fit the best curve were generated based on R 2 values
≥ 0.9. Student’s T-test was used to access statistically significant P values <0.05. The
statistical analyses specific to each software program used in the bioinformatics analysis are
described above.

Figure 1. The antiviral activity of daclatasvir (DCV) and sofosbuvir (SFV) against
SARS-CoV-2. Vero (A and D), HuH-7 (B and E) or Calu-3 (C and F) cells, at density of 5 x
105 cells/well in 48-well plates, were infected with SARS-CoV-2, for 1h at 37 °C. Inoculum
was removed, cells were washed and incubated with fresh DMEM containing 2% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and the indicated concentrations of the DCV, SFV, chloroquine (CQ),
lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV+RTV) or ribavirin (RBV). Vero (A and D) were infected with MOI
of 0.01 and supernatants were accessed after 24 h. HuH-7 (B and E) and Calu-3 (C and F)
cells were infected with MOI of 0.1 and supernatants were accessed after 48 h. Viral
replication in the culture supernatant was measured by PFU/mL. Results are displayed as
percentage of inhibition (A-C) or virus titers (D-F). The data represent means ± SEM of three
independent experiments.

Figure 2. Sofosbuvir (SFV) inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in human iPS cell-derived
NSCs. (A) NSCs were infected at MOIs of 0.1 and treated with 1 µM of SFV or daclatasvir
(DCV). After 5 days, the culture supernatants were collected, and the virus was quantified
by RNA levels using RT-PCR. (B) NSCs in spheroid format were labeled for Tunel and
DAPI after 5 days post-infection. The data represent means ± SEM of three independent
experiments. * indicates P < 0.05 for the comparison between the SARS-CoV-2-infected
cells untreated (nil) vs treated with SFV.
Figure 3. Daclatasvir (DCV) impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication and cytokine storm in
human primary monocytes. Human primary monocytes were infected at the MOI of 0.01
and treated with 1 µM of daclatasvir (DCV) sofosbuvir (SFV), chloroquine (CQ), atazanavir
(ATV) or atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV+RTV). After 24h, cell-associated virus RNA loads (A),
as well as TNF-α (B) and IL-6 (C) levels in the culture supernatant were measured. The data
represent means ± SEM of experiments with cells from at least three healthy donors.
Differences with P < 0.05 are indicates (*), when compared to untreated cells (nil) to each
specific treatment.
Figure 4. Daclatasvir (DCV) and sofosbuvir (SFV) reduced SARS-CoV-2 associated
RNA synthesis. (A) To initially understand the temporal pattern of inhibition promoted
daclatasvir, we performed by Time-of-addition assays. Vero cells were infected with MOI 0f
0.01 of SARS-CoV-2 and treated with daclatasvir or ribavirin (RBV) with two-times their
EC50 values at different times after infection, as indicated. After 24h post infection, culture
supernatant was harvested and SARS-CoV-2 replication measured by plaque assay. (B) Next,
Calu-3 cells (5 x 105 cells/well in 48-well plates), were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI
of 0.1, for 1h at 37 °C. Inoculum was removed, cells were washed and incubated with fresh
DMEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and the indicated concentrations of the
daclatasvir, SFV or ribavirin (RBV) at 10 µM. After 48h, cells monolayers were lysed, total
RNA extracted and quantitative RT-PCR performed for detection of ORF1 and ORFE
mRNA. The data represent means ± SEM of three independent experiments. * P< 0.05 for
comparisons with vehicle (DMSO). # P< 0.05 for differences in genomic and sub-genomic
RNA.

Figure 6. Daclatasvir (DCV) favors SARS-CoV-2 RNA unfold. A total of 10 ng of SARSCoV-2 RNA was incubated with 10 or 100 nM of DCV during a standard melting curve in
the presence of picogreen, derivative (A) and normalized (B) reports are presented. (C) the
scheme represent the percentage of wild-type (WT; white) and mutant (black) virus after
growing SARS-CoV-2 in Vero Cells at a MOI 10 times higher than used in other
experiments, 0.1, and sequentially treated with sub-optimal doses of DCV. Each passage was
done after 2-4 days pos-infection, when cytopathic effect was evident. Virus RNA was
unbiased sequenced using a MGI-2000 and a metatrasncriptomic approach was employed
during the analysis. WT (D) and mutant (E) SARS-CoV-2 secondary RNA structure
encompassing the nucleotides 28169-28259 are presented.
