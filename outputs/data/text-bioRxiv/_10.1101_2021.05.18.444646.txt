Abstract

3

The interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 virus Spike protein’s receptor binding domain

4

(RBD) and the ACE2 cell surface protein is required for viral infection of cells. Mutations in

5

the RBD domain are present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that have emerged

6

independently worldwide. For example, the more transmissible B.1.1.7 lineage has a

7

mutation (N501Y) in its Spike RBD domain that enhances binding to ACE2. There are also

8

ACE2 alleles in humans with mutations in the RBD binding site. Here we perform a detailed

9

affinity and kinetics analysis of the effect of five common RBD mutations (K417N, K417T,

10

N501Y, E484K and S477N) and two common ACE2 mutations (S19P and K26R) on the

11

RBD/ACE2 interaction. We analysed the effects of individual RBD mutations, and

12

combinations found in new SARS-CoV-2 variants first identified in the UK (B.1.1.7), South

13

Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P1). Most of these mutations increased the affinity of the

14

RBD/ACE2 interaction. The exceptions were mutations K417N/T, which decreased the

15

affinity. Taken together with other studies, our results suggest that the N501Y and S477N

16

mutations primarily enhance transmission, the K417N/T mutations facilitate immune

17

escape, and the E484K mutation facilitates both transmission and immune escape.

Introduction

20

Since its identification in 2019, the second coronavirus able to induce a severe acute

21

respiratory syndrome in humans, SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in the most severe global

22

pandemic in 100 years. To date more than 135 million people have been infected, resulting

23

in the deaths from the resulting disease, COVID-19, of more than 3 million people (“WHO

24

Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard,” 2021), and measures introduced to control spread

25

have had harmful social and economic impacts. Fortunately, effective vaccines have been

26

developed, and a global vaccination programme is underway (Mahase, 2021). New SARS-

27

CoV-2 variants of concern are emerging that are making containment of the pandemic more

28

difficult, by increasing transmissivity of the virus (Davies and Edmunds, 2021; Korber et al.,

29

2020; Volz et al., 2021a, 2021b; Washington et al., 2021) and/or its resistance to protective

30

immunity induced by previous infection or vaccines (Darby and Hiscox, 2021; Dejnirattisai et

31

al., 2021; Garcia-Beltran et al., 2021; Madhi et al., 2021a, 2021b; Mahase, 2021).(Volz et al.,

32

2021a, 2021b)

33

The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters cells following an interaction between the Spike (S) protein on

34

its surface with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on cell surfaces (V’kovski et al.,

35

2021). The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein binds the membrane-distal

36

portion of the ACE2 protein. The S protein forms a homotrimer, which is cleaved shortly

37

after synthesis into two fragments that remain associated non-covalently: S1, which

38

contains the RBD, and S2, which mediates membrane fusion following the binding of Spike

39

to ACE2 (V’kovski et al., 2021). During the pandemic mutations have appeared in the Spike

40

protein that apparently increase transmissivity (Davies and Edmunds, 2021; Korber et al.,

41

2020; Volz et al., 2021a, 2021b; Washington et al., 2021). One that emerged early in Europe,

42

D614G, and quickly became dominant globally (Korber et al., 2020), increases the density of

43

intact Spike trimer on the virus surface by preventing premature dissociation of S1 from S2

44

following cleavage (Zhang et al., 2021, 2020). A later mutant, N501Y, which has appeared in

45

multiple lineages, lies within the RBD domain, and increases its affinity for ACE2 (Starr et al.,

46

2020; Supasa et al., 2021). These findings suggest that mutations that directly or indirectly

47

enhance Spike binding to ACE2 will increase transmissivity.

48

Prior infection by SARS-CoV-2 and current vaccines induce antibody responses to the Spike

49

protein, and most neutralizing antibodies appear to bind to the Spike RBD domain (Garcia3

50

Beltran et al., 2021; Greaney et al., 2021a; Rogers et al., 2020). Some variants of concern

51

have mutations in their RBD domain that confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies (Darby

52

and Hiscox, 2021; Dejnirattisai et al., 2021; Garcia-Beltran et al., 2021; Madhi et al., 2021a,

53

2021b; Mahase, 2021). What is less clear is the precise effect of these mutations on the

54

affinity and kinetics of the binding of RBD to ACE2. Previous studies of the interaction

55

between the Spike RBD and ACE2 have produced a wide range of affinity and kinetic

56

estimates under conditions (e.g. temperature) that are not always well defined (Lei et al.,

57

2020; Shang et al., 2020; Supasa et al., 2021; Wrapp et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021, 2020).

58

Precise information is needed to assess the extent to which RBD mutations have been

59

selected because they enhance ACE2 binding or facilitate immune evasion.

60

In this study we undertook a detailed affinity and kinetic analysis of the interaction between

61

Spike RBD and ACE2 at physiological temperatures, taking care to avoid common pitfalls.

62

We used this optimized approach to analyse the effect of important common mutations

63

identified in variants of RBD and ACE2. Both mutations of ACE2 (S19P, K26R) and most of

64

the mutations of RBD (N501Y, E484K, and S477N) enhanced the interaction, with some RBD

65

mutations (N501Y) increasing the affinity by ~10 fold. Increased binding was the result of

66

decreases in dissociation rate constants (N501Y, S477N) and/or increases in association rate

67

constants (N501Y, E484K). Although the K417N/T mutations found in the South African

68

(B.1.351) and Brazilian (P.1) variants both decreased the affinity, the affinity-enhancing

69

N501Y and E484K mutations that are also present in both variants confer a net ~4 fold

70

increase in the affinity of their RBD domains for ACE2.

71

Results

72

Selection of variants

73

The focus of this study was to analyse common and therefore important variants of RBD and

74

ACE2. Henceforth we will refer to the common ACE2 allele and RBD of the original SARS-

75

CoV-2 strain sequenced in Wuhan as wild-type (WT). We chose mutations of RBD within the

76

ACE2 binding site that have appeared independently in multiple SARS-CoV-2 lineages/clades

77

(Fig. 1 and Fig. S1) (Hodcroft, 2021; Rambaut et al., 2020), suggesting that they confer a

78

selective advantage, rather than emerged by chance, such as through a founder effect. The

79

N501Y mutation has appeared in the B.1.1.7 (20I/501Y.V1), B.1.351 (20H/501Y.V2), and P.1

80

lineages (20J/501Y.V3) first identified in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, respectively. The

81

E484K mutation is present in the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages, and has appeared independently

82

in many other lineages including P.2 (20B/S.484K), B.1.1.318, B.1.525 (20A/S:4.4K), and

83

B.1.526 (20C/S.484K). E484K has also appeared in VOC-202102-02, a subset of the B.1.1.7

84

lineage identified in the UK(“SARS-CoV-2 Variants of concern and variants under

85

investigation - GOV.UK,” 2021) . The S477N mutation became dominant for periods in

86

Australia (clade 20F) and parts of Europe (20A.EU2), and then appeared in New York in

87

lineage B.1.526 (H. Zhou et al., 2021). Mutations of K417 have appeared independently in

88

the South African B.1.351 and Brazilian P.1 lineages. Interestingly, N501Y, E484K and S477N

89

were the main mutations that appeared following random RBD mutagenesis and in vitro

90

selection of mutants with enhanced ACE2 binding (Zahradník et al., 2021).

91

We selected for analysis the two most common mutations of ACE2 within the RBD binding

92

site, K26R and S19P (Fig. 1C). They are present in 0.4% and 0.03%, respectively, of all

93

samples in the gnomAD database (Karczewski et al., 2020), while other ACE2 mutations in

94

the RBD binding site are much less frequent (<0.004%). K26R is observed in all the major

95

gnomAD populations but is most common in Ashkenazi Jews (1%), and (non-Finnish) north-

96

western Europeans (0.6%). It is less common in Africans/African-Americans and South

97

Asians (0.1%) and rare in Finnish (0.05%) and East-Asian (0.001%) populations. The S19P

98

mutant is almost exclusively found in Africans/African-Americans (0.3 %).

99

Measurement of affinity and kinetics

100

To measure the effects of these mutations on the affinity and kinetics of the RBD/ACE2

101

interaction we used surface plasmon resonance, which allows very accurate measurements,

102

provided that common pitfalls are avoided, particularly protein aggregation, mass-transport

103

limitations and rebinding (Merwe and Barclay, 1996; Myszka, 1997). Monomeric, soluble

104

forms of the ectodomain of the ACE2 and the Spike RBD-domain were expressed in human

105

cells, to retain native glycosylation, and purified (Fig. S2). ACE2 was captured onto the

106

sensor surface via a carboxy-terminal biotin and RBD injected over the ACE2 at different

107

concentrations (Fig. 2A). Excellent fits of 1:1 Langmuir binding model to the data yielded an

108

association rate constant (kon) of 0.9 ± 0.05 M-1.s-1 and a dissociation rate constant (koff) of

109

0.067 ± 0.0011 s-1 (mean ± SD, n=6, Table 1). These rate constants are 3 to 25 fold faster

110

than previously reported for the same interaction (Lei et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020;

111

Supasa et al., 2021; Wrapp et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021). However, previous experiments

112

were conducted at unphysiologically low temperatures (i.e. below 37° C) and under

113

conditions in which mass-transport limitations and rebinding are highly likely (see

114

Discussion). These factors, and the presence of protein aggregates, would all lower the

115

measured rate constants. In contrast, our measurements were conducted at 37° C and

116

under conditions in which mass-transfer limitation and rebinding were excluded. The latter

117

is demonstrated by the fact that measured kon and koff rates were clearly maximal at the low

118

level of ACE2 immobilization (~50 RU) used in our experiments (Fig. 2B and C). The excellent

119

fit of the 1:1 binding model to our data excludes an effect of protein aggregates, which yield

120

complex kinetics. The calculated dissociation constant (KD) was 74 ± 4 nM (mean ± SD, n=6,

121

Table 1). We also measured KD by equilibrium binding (Fig. 2D), which avoids any artefacts

122

induced by mass transfer limitations and rebinding. This KD determined by equilibrium

123

binding was very similar to the value calculated from kinetic data [63 ± 7.7 nM (mean ± SD,

124

n = 24, Table 1], and did not vary with immobilization level (Fig. 2E), further validating our

125

kinetic measurements. These affinity values are within the wide range reported in previous

126

studies, which varied from KD 11 to 133 nM (Lei et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Supasa et al.,

127

2021; Wrapp et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021).

128

The effect of RBD mutations

129

We next evaluated the effect of RBD mutations on the affinity and kinetics of binding to

130

ACE2 (Figure 3 and Table 1). Example sensorgrams are shown of mutations that increased

131

(N501Y, Fig. 3A) or decreased (K417N, Fig. 3B) the binding affinity, while the key results

132

from all mutants are summarized in Figure 3C. The single mutations S477N, E484K and

133

N501Y all enhanced binding. The N501Y mutation had the biggest effect, increasing the

134

affinity ~10 fold to KD ~7 nM, by increasing the kon ~1.8 fold and decreasing the koff by ~ 7

135

fold. The S477N and E484K mutations increased the affinity more modestly (~ 1.5 fold), by

136

decreasing the koff (S477N) or increasing the kon (E484K). The K417T and K417N mutations

137

decreased the affinity ~2 and ~4 fold, respectively, mainly by decreasing the kon but also by

138

increasing the koff. Affinity-altering mutations in binding sites mainly affect the koff (Agius et

139

al., 2013), and have more modest effects on the kon. Changes in electrostatic interactions

140

can dramatically affect the kon (Schreiber and Fersht, 1996), and are a plausible explanation

141

for the effects of the mutations K417T, K417N and E484K on kon. K417 forms a salt bridge

142

with D30 on ACE2 (Lan et al., 2020) while E484 is ~9 Å from E75 on ACE2 (Lan et al., 2020).

143

Thus the mutations K417N/T and E484K would decrease and increase, respectively, long-

144

range electrostatic forces that may accelerate association (Schreiber and Fersht, 1996).

145

We also examined the effect on ACE2 binding of the combinations of RBD mutations,

146

including combinations present in VOC-202102-02, a subset of the B.1.1.7 lineage (N501Y)

147

with the E484K mutation (“SARS-CoV-2 Variants of concern and variants under investigation

148

- GOV.UK,” 2021), and the B.1.351 and P.1 variants (Fig. 3C, Table 1). In the case of VOC-

149

202102-02, the addition of the E484K mutation to N501Y further increased the affinity, to

150

~15 fold higher than WT RBD (KD ~5 nM), by further increasing the kon. Because the higher

151

kon could result in mass transfer limiting binding, we confirmed that the kinetic

152

measurement for this variant was not substantially affected by varying levels of

153

immobilization (Fig. S4). The affinity of the B.1.351 (K417N/ E484K/N501Y) and P.1

154

(K417T/E484K/N501Y) RBD variants for ACE2 increased by 3.7 and 5.3 fold, respectively,

155

relative to wild type RBD by increasing the kon and decreasing the koff rate constants.

156

We next examined whether the effects of the mutations were additive, as is typically the

157

case for multiple mutations at protein/protein interfaces (Wells, 1990). To do this we

158

converted the changes in KD to changes in binding energy (G, Table 2) and examined

159

whether the G measured for RBD variants with multiple mutations was equal to the sum

160

of the G values measured for the individual RBD mutants. This was indeed the case (Fig.

161

3D), indicating that the effects on each mutation are independent. This is consistent with

162

them being spaced well apart within the interface (Fig. 1C), and also validates the accuracy

163

of the affinity measurements.

164

The effects of ACE2 mutations

165

We next examined the effects of mutations of ACE2 (S19P and K26R) on binding to both wild

166

type and common variants of RBD (Fig. 4 and Table 1). Both S19P and K26R increased the

167

affinity of WT RBD binding by ~3.7 and ~2.4 fold (Fig. 4A). These increases in affinity were

168

the result of increases in the kon and decreases in the koff.

169

Finally, we looked for interactions between RBD and ACE2 mutations by measuring the

170

effects of the ACE2 mutations on binding to all mutant forms of RBD (Table 1). After

171

converting changes in KD to G (Table 2) we examined whether G measured for a given

7

172

ACE2 variant/RBD variant interaction was equal to the sum of the G measured for ACE2

173

variant/RBD WT and ACE WT/RBD variant interactions. This is depicted as the difference

174

between the measured and predicted G for interactions between ACE2 and RBD variants

175

(G in Figs. 4B and C). In most cases G values were close to zero, indicating that the

176

effects of these mutations largely independent. The one notable exception was the ACE2

177

S19P and RBD S477N variants, where the measured value was significantly lower than the

178

predicted value (Fig. 4B), indicating that these mutations were not independent. This is

179

consistent with the fact that the ACE2 residue S19 is adjacent to RBD residue S477 in the

180

contact interface (Fig. 1C).

181

Discussion

182

While our finding that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD binds ACE2 with an affinity of KD 74 nM at 37°C

183

is consistent with previous studies (KD 11 to 133 nM) (Lei et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020;

184

Supasa et al., 2021; Wrapp et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021, 2020), the rate constants that we

185

measured (kon 0.9 M-1.s-1 and koff 0.067 s-1) were more than 3 fold faster than all previous

186

reports. One likely reason for this is that previous measurements were performed at lower

187

temperatures, which almost always decreases rate constants. While one study stated that

188

binding constants were measured at 25°C (Zhang et al., 2020), most studies did not report

189

the temperature, suggesting that they were performed at room temperature, or the

190

standard instrument temperature (20-25°C). A second likely reason is that previous kinetic

191

studies were performed under conditions in which the rate of diffusion of soluble molecule

192

to the sensor surface limits the association rate and rebinding of dissociated molecules to

193

the surface reduces the measured dissociation rate. These are known pitfalls of both

194

techniques used in these studies, which were surface plasmon resonance (Myszka, 1997)

195

and bilayer interferometry (Abdiche et al., 2008). In the present study we avoided these

196

issues by immobilizing a very low level of ligand on the sensor surface. A third possible

197

reason is that the proteins were aggregated, which can cause problems even when

198

aggregates are a very minor contaminant (van der Merwe and Barclay, 1996). The presence

199

of aggregates results in complex binding kinetics, which can be excluded if the simple 1:1

200

Langmuir binding model fits the kinetic data. While this was demonstrated in the present

201

study, and some previous studies (Shang et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021),

202

such fits were not shown in other studies, one of which reported more than 20 fold slower

203

kinetics than reported here (Lei et al., 2020; Supasa et al., 2021).

204

The RBD mutants that we selected for analysis have all emerged independently and become

205

dominant in a region at least once in different lineages, suggesting that they provide a

206

selective advantage. Our finding that the N501Y, E484K, and S477N all increase the binding

207

affinity of RBD for ACE2 raises the question as to whether this contributed to their selection.

208

Several lines of evidence suggest that enhancing the Spike/ACE2 interaction would be

209

advantageous. Firstly, the virus has spread only very recently to humans from another

210

mammalian host, providing insufficient time for optimization of the affinity. Secondly,

211

epidemiological studies have demonstrated enhanced transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 variant,

212

which has the N501Y mutation (Volz et al., 2021b; Washington et al., 2021). Finally, a SARS-

213

CoV-2 variant with the Spike mutation D614G, which increases its activity by stabilizing it

214

following furin cleavage (Zhang et al., 2021, 2020), rapidly became dominant globally after it

215

emerged (Korber et al., 2020; Volz et al., 2021a). Taken together, these findings suggest that

216

WT Spike/ACE2 interaction is limiting for transmission, and that mutations which enhance it,

217

including the N501Y, E484K, and S477N mutations, would provide a selective advantage by

218

increasing transmissibility. This raises two questions. Firstly, will other RBD mutations

219

appear in SARS-CoV-2 which further enhance transmission? This seems likely, given that a

220

large number of RBD mutations have been identified that increase the RBD/ACE2 affinity

221

(Starr et al., 2020; Zahradník et al., 2021). Secondly, will combinations of existing mutations

222

be selected because they further increasing the affinity? While the appearance E484K

223

together with the N501Y in three lineages (B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1) supports this, it is also

224

possible that E484K was selected because it disrupts antibody neutralization, as discussed

225

below.

226

Studies of other enveloped viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, suggest that increases in affinity

227

of viral fusion ligands for their cellular receptors can increase cell infection and disease

228

severity (Hasegawa et al., 2007; Li et al., 2005). One study found that increasing this affinity

229

enabled the virus to infect cells with lower receptor surface density (Hasegawa et al., 2007).

230

It follows that increases in affinity could increase the number of host tissues infected, which

231

could increase the severity of disease (Cao and Li, 2020) and/or increase the viral load in the

upper respiratory tract el (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Wölfel et al., 2020), thereby increasing

233

spread.

234
235

Another mechanism by which mutations of RBD could provide a selective advantage is

236

through evasion of immune responses. This is supported by the observation that

237

neutralizing antibodies present in those infected by or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2

238

primarily target the RBD domain (Garcia-Beltran et al., 2021; Greaney et al., 2021a; Rogers

239

et al., 2020). Furthermore, two variants with RBD mutations that abrogate antibody

240

neutralization, B.1.351 and P1, became dominant in regions with very high levels of prior

241

SARS-CoV-2 infection (Cele et al., 2021; Dejnirattisai et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2021;

242

Sabino et al., 2021; Tegally et al., 2021; D. Zhou et al., 2021). Both of these lineages include

243

the N501Y mutation, but this appears to have fairly modest effect on antibody

244

neutralization (Greaney et al., 2021a, 2021b). In contrast, the E484K mutation, also present

245

in both lineages, potently disrupts antibody neutralization (Greaney et al., 2021a, 2021b).

246

Our finding that the K417N/T mutants present in B.1.351/P.1 lineages decrease the affinity

247

of RBD for ACE2 suggests that they were selected because they facilitate immune escape.

248

Indeed, mutations of K417 can block antibody neutralization, albeit less effectively than

249

E484K (Greaney et al., 2021a, 2021b; Wang et al., 2021). It is notable that these affinity-

250

reducing K417N/T mutants have only emerged together with mutants (N501Y and E484K)

251

that increase the affinity of RBD for ACE2, suggest a cooperative effect between mutations

252

that enhance immune escape and mutations that increase affinity.

253

The effect of the increased affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD of the K26R and S19P ACE2

254

mutants are less clear. The evidence summarised above that WT RBD/ACE2 binding is

255

limiting for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, suggest that carriers of these ACE2 variants will be at

256

greater risk of infection and/or severe disease. In contrast to SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations,

257

the effects of ACE2 variants are primarily relevant to the carriers of these mutations. A

258

preliminary analysis (MacGowan et al., 2021) suggests that the carriers of the K26R ACE

259

allele might be at increased risk of severe disease, but the findings did not reach statistical

260

significance, and further studies are required.

261

The interaction that we identified between the RBD S477N and ACE2 S19P mutants

262

highlights the importance of considering variation in the host population when studying the

263

evolution of viral variants. In this case, the opposite effect of the RBD S477N mutation on its

264

affinity for ACE2 S19P (decreased) compared with ACE2 WT (increased), suggests that this

265

RBD variant may have a selective disadvantage amongst carriers of the ACE2 S19P variant, in

266

contrast to those with WT ACE2, where it is advantageous. However, the low frequency of

267

this variant will make this difficult to detect and suggests that it is unlikely to be important

268

at a population level.

269

It is noteworthy that the two most common ACE2 variants are in positions on ACE2 with no

270

known functional activity. This raises the question as to whether these mutations are a

271

remnant of historic adaption to pathogens that utilised this portion of ACE2. The fact that

272

ACE2 S19P mutation is largely confined to African/African-American populations, suggests

273

that it is more recent than K26R and/or selected by pathogen(s) confined to the African

274

continent.

ACE2 and RBD point mutations were introduced using the Agilent QuikChange II XL Site-

299

Directed Mutagenesis Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. The primers were

300

designed using the Agilent QuikChange primer design web program.

301

HEK293F cell transfection

302

Cells were grown in FreeStyle™ 293 Expression Medium (12338018) in a 37 °C incubator

303

with 8% CO2 on a shaking platform at 130 rpm. Cells were passaged every 2-3 days with the

304

suspension volume always kept below 33.3% of the total flask capacity. The cell density was

305

kept between 0.5 and 2 million per ml. Before transfection cells were counted to check cell

306

viability was above 95% and the density adjusted to 1.0 million per ml. For 100 ml

307

transfection, 100 µl FreeStyle™ MAX Reagent (16447100) was mixed with 2 ml Opti-MEM

308

(51985034) for 5 minutes. During this incubation 100 µg of expression plasmid was mixed

309

with 2 ml Opti-MEM. For in situ biotinylation of ACE2 90 µg of expression plasmid was

310

mixed with 10 µg of expression plasmid encoding the BirA enzyme. The DNA was then

311

mixed with the MAX Reagent and incubated for 25 minutes before being added to the cell

312

culture. For ACE2 in situ biotinylation, biotin was added to the cell culture at a final

313

concentration of 50 µM. The culture was left for 5 days for protein expression to take place.

314

Protein purification

315

Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the supernatant collected and filtered through a

316

0.22 μm filter. Imidazole was added to a final concentration of 10 mM and PMSF added to a

317

final concentration of 1 mM. 1 ml of Ni-NTA Agarose (30310) was added per 100 ml of

318

supernatant and the mix was left on a rolling platform at 4 °C overnight. The supernatant

319

mix was poured through a gravity flow column to collect the Ni-NTA Agarose. The Ni-NTA

320

Agarose was washed 3 times with 25 ml of wash buffer (50 mM NaH 2PO4, 300 mM NaCl and

321

20 mM imidazole at pH 8). The protein was eluted from the Ni-NTA Agarose with elution

322

buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl and 250 mM imidazole at pH 8). The protein was

concentrated, and buffer exchanged into size exclusion buffer (25 mM NaH2PO4, 150 mM

324

NaCl at pH 7.5) using a protein concentrator with a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off. The

325

protein was concentrated down to less than 500 μl before loading onto a Superdex 200

326

10/300 GL size exclusion column (Fig. S2). Fractions corresponding to the desired peak were

327

pooled and frozen at -80 °C. Samples from all observed peaks were analysed on an SDS-

328

PAGE gel (Fig. S2).

329

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)

330

RBD binding to ACE2 was analysed on a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare Life

331

Sciences) at 37°C and a flow rate of 30 µl/min. Running buffer was HBS-EP (BR100669).

332

Streptavidin was coupled to a CM5 sensor chip (29149603) using an amine coupling kit

333

(BR100050) to near saturation, typically 10000-12000 response units (RU). Biotinylated

334

ACE2 WT and variants were injected into the experimental flow cells (FC2–FC4) for different

335

lengths of time to produce desired immobilisation levels (40–800 RU). FC1 was used as a

336

reference and contained streptavidin only. Excess streptavidin was blocked with two 40 s

337

injections of 250 µM biotin (Avidity). Before RBD injections, the chip surface was

338

conditioned with 8 injections of the running buffer. A dilution series of RBD was then

339

injected simultaneously in all FCs. Buffer alone was injected after every 2 or 3 RBD

340

injections. The length of all injections was 30 s, and dissociation was monitored from 180-

341

670 s. The background response measured in FC1 was subtracted from the response in the

342

other three FCs. In addition, the responses during buffer injections closest in time were

343

subtracted from association and dissociation phases. Such double-referencing improves

344

data quality when binding responses are as low as needed to obtain accurate kinetic data

345

(Myszka, 1999). In each experiment, after all RBD injections, an ACE2-specific mouse

346

monoclonal antibody (NOVUS Biologicals, AC384) was injected at 5 µg/ml for 10 minutes to

347

confirm the presence and amount of immobilized ACE2.

348

Data analysis

349

Double referenced binding data was fitted using GraphPad Prism. The koff was determined

350

by fitting a mono- exponential decay curve to data from the dissociation phase of each

351

injection. The koff from four to six RBD injections was averaged to give a value for the koff

352

(Fig. S3A). The kon was determined by first fitting a mono-exponential association curve to

353

data from the association phase, yielding kobs. The kon was be determined by plotting the kobs

354

vs the concentration of RBD and performing a linear fit of the equation kobs = kon*[RBD] + koff

355

to this data (Fig. S3B), using the koff determined as above.

356

The KD was either calculated (calculated KD = koff/kon) or measured directly (equilibrium KD)

357

as follows. Equilibrium binding levels at a given [RBD]concentration were determined from

358

the fit above of the mono-exponential association phase model to the association phase

359

data. These equilibrium binding values were plotted against [RBD] and a fit of the simple

360

1:1 Langmuir binding model to this data was used to determine the equilibrium KD (Fig. 2D).

361

ΔG for each affinity measurement was calculated the relationship G =R*T*lnKD, where R =

362

1.987 cal mol-1 K-1, T = 310.18 K, and K D is in units M. ΔΔG values (Table 2 and Fig. 3D) were

363

calculated for each mutant from the relationship G = GWT − GM. The predicted G for

364

interactions with multiple mutants were calculated by adding the single mutant G values

365

(Fig. 3D). The difference between the measured and predicted G (G) for interactions

366

between the ACE2 and RBD mutants was calculates as G = measured G – predicted

367

G (Fig. 4B).

368

All errors represent standard deviations and errors for calculated values were determined

369

by error propagation.

of WT RBD and the indicated ACE2 variants (Error bars show SD, n = 3). (B-C) Show the
difference (G) between the measured and predicted G for S19P (B) and K26R (C)
ACE2 variants binding to the indicated RBD variants, calculated from data in Table 2. The
predicted G values for each variant RBD/variant ACE2 interaction were calculated from
the sum of the G for the ACE2 variant binding WT RBD and the G for the RBD variant
binding WT ACE2 (Table 2).

Figure S1. Emergence of the same RBD mutations in multiple SAR2-CoV-2 clades.
The figure highlights the SARS-CoV-2 clades containing RBD mutations investigated in this
study. The phylogenetic trees were constructed as in Fig. 1A from SARS-CoV-2 sequences
accessed on the 22nd April 2021 (N = 3,914). (A) N501Y has emerged independently of the
three clades 501Y.V1, 501Y.V2, and 501Y.V3. Mutation to T at this position has also
occurred frequently. (B) E484K has also been observed independently of its main progenitor
clades 501Y.V2 and 501Y.V3. E484Q and E484G have also been observed. (C) S477N has
been observed beyond clades 20F and 20A.EU2. Mutations to I and R have also been
occasionally observed at this position. (D) Mutations of K417 to N and T have been observed
almost exclusively in the 20H.501Y.V2 and 20J.501Y.V3 clades.
