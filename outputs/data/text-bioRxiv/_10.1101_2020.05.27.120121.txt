Abstract

17

Group B Coxsackieviruses belonging to the genus, Enterovirus, contain six serotypes that

18

induce various diseases, whose occurrence may involve the mediation of more than one serotype.

19

We recently identified immunogenic epitopes within CVB3 viral protein 1 that induce anti-viral T

20

cell responses in mouse models of CVB infections. In our investigations to determine the

21

protective responses of the viral epitopes, we unexpectedly noted that animals immunized with

22

complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) alone and later challenged with CVB3 were completely

23

protected against myocarditis. Similarly, the pancreatitis-inducing ability of CVB3 was

24

remarkably reduced to only 10% in the CFA group as opposed to 73.3% in the control group that

25

received no CFA. Additionally, no mortalities were noted in the CFA group, whereas 40% of

26

control animals died during the course of 21 days post-infection with CVB3. Taken together, our

27

data suggest that the adjuvant effects of CFA may be sufficient for protection against CVB

28

infections. These observations may provide new insights into our understanding of the occurrence

29

of viral infections. One example is Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) as individuals suffering

30

from COVID-19 who have been vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette–Guérin appear to have fewer

31

morbidities and mortalities than unvaccinated individuals.

Introduction

34

Enteroviruses belonging to the Picornaviridae family are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA

35

viruses. Based on the currently adopted method of molecular typing of the viral protein (VP)1

36

nucleotide composition, 13 species of enteroviruses have been identified [1]. Infections caused by

37

four enterovirus species, Enterovirus A to D, are the most common that occur in humans, especially

38

infants (children less than 1 year of age) and immune-compromised individuals [1, 2].

39

Enteroviruses induce a wide spectrum of illnesses, such as meningitis, encephalitis, paralysis,

40

myocarditis, and rash/foot and mouth disease [2]. Although enteroviral infections can occur

41

anywhere in the world, recent outbreaks of respiratory illness in the United States highlight their

42

growing importance in human health [3-5].

43

We have been studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms of protective immune

44

responses in mouse models, particularly for Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and CVB4, which are

45

implicated in the causation of myocarditis/dilated cardiomyopathy and Type I diabetes (TID),

46

respectively [6, 7]. In our efforts to determine the protective effects of viral epitopes, we

47

unexpectedly noted that animals immunized with complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) containing

48

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) extract were found to be completely protected from CVB3

49

infection. Our data may provide new insights regarding the occurrence of viral infections such as

50

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), since individuals vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette–Guérin

51

(BCG) tend to show fewer morbidities and mortalities than unvaccinated individuals [8, 9].

Materials and Methods

53

Mice

54

Six-to-eight-week old, female A/J mice (H-2a) were procured from the Jackson Laboratory

55

(Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Animals were maintained according to the institutional guidelines of the

56

University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), Lincoln, NE, and approval for animal studies was granted

57

by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, UNL (protocol #1904, approved January 2,

58

2020). Mice infected with CVB3 were monitored closely for clinical signs suggestive of distress.

59

All research staff followed biosafety level 2 guidelines while handling the animals. Animals whose

60

clinical signs persisted, did not eat or drink, and failed to move when touched or prodded physically

61

were immediately euthanized. Euthanasia was performed using a carbon dioxide chamber as

62

recommended by the Panel on Euthanasia, the American Veterinary Medical Association.

63

Virus propagation and infection

64

The Nancy strain of CVB3 was procured from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,

65

Manassas, VA, USA), and the virus was titrated in Vero cells (ATCC). The adherent Vero cells

66

were grown to 80 to 90% confluence in 75cm2 flasks in EMEM/10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and

67

were later infected with CVB3 with multiplicity of infection 1 in EMEM containing no FBS. After

68

incubation at 37⁰ C for 1 hour with gentle intermittent rocking, maintenance medium (EMEM/2%

69

FBS) was added. Based on the cytopathic effect of virus during the next 1 to 2 days, supernatants

70

containing virus were harvested. After determining 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)

71

values based on the Reed-Muench method, the virus stocks were aliquoted and preserved at -80⁰

72

C [10]. To infect mice, virus stock diluted in 1x PBS to contain 50 TCID50 in 100 µl was

73

administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). We chose this dose based on titration experiments [10] that

74

allowed us to capture pathological changes in both heart and pancreas over a period of 3 weeks by

75

avoiding acute mortalities that usually occur at relatively higher doses within ~10 days post-

76

infection [11, 12]. Animals were monitored closely, cages were changed once in 2 days, and body

77

weights were taken daily until termination. In addition, an alternative food and fluid source, trans

78

gel diet (ClearH2O, Portland, ME, USA), was placed on the cage floor as needed.

79

Challenge studies in animals immunized with CFA

80

Our initial focus was to determine the protective effects, if any, of virus-reactive T cells by

81

immunizing mice with viral peptides that we have recently described elsewhere [13]. In these

82

investigations, two groups ‒ CVB3 infection alone and CFA immunizations/CVB3 challenge ‒

83

were involved. Groups of mice were immunized subcutaneously with or without CFA containing

84

M. tb [14] (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml as a single

85

dose (200 µl; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) on day -7 in sternal and inguinal regions [15].

86

Seven days later (day 0), animals were challenged with CVB3 at 50 TCID50/mouse, i.p., and after

87

taking body weights and monitoring for mortalities, experiments were terminated on days 20-21

88

post-infection and tissues were collected for histology.

89

Histology

90

Hearts and pancreata were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin and processed to obtain

91

5 µm thick serial sections, ~50 µm apart. All sections were stained by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H

92

& E). The analysis was performed by a board-certified pathologist blinded to treatment, and total

93

number of inflammatory foci were obtained as reported previously [10, 16].

94

Statistics

95

Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze the data pertaining to body weights

96

and survival curves using Proc Glimmix in SAS (Version 9.3, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

Results and Discussion

100

In this report, we provide evidence that immunization with immune-stimulating adjuvants like

101

CFA alone can offer protection against viral infections. In this setting, we used A/J mice that are

102

highly susceptible to CVB infections, with affected animals showing severe pancreatitis and

103

myocarditis within approximately 7 to 10 days post-infection [13, 16, 18]. Although our primary

104

focus was to determine whether viral peptides can offer protection in challenge studies with CVB3,

105

we made an unexpected observation that the protection offered by CFA emulsions containing viral

106

peptides was indistinguishable (data not shown) from that conferred by immunization with CFA

107

alone. First, we noted that the positive control group (unimmunized) infected with CVB3 showed

108

reduction in body weights by ~20% as expected, whereas none of the animals immunized with

109

CFA alone lost body weight (Fig 1a). Second, mortality patterns were also found to be similar to

110

those of body weights, in that none of the animals immunized with CFA alone died, whereas 40%

111

of animals (6/15) in the control group died (Fig 1b), pointing to the possibility that CFA-

112

immunized animals would also be free of histologic disease.

120

To investigate pathological changes, we examined the hearts and pancreata by H & E staining

121

and scored disease severity as we have described previously [10, 15, 16]. As indicated in Table 1,

122

top panel, and Figure 2, heart sections in 40% (6/15) of the animals from the CVB3-infected group

123

showed myocardial lesions containing inflammatory foci with macrophage infiltrates, necrosis and

124

mineralization as expected [10, 16], but none of the animals in the CFA group had any detectable

125

lesions. Similarly, histological evaluation of pancreatic sections from the CVB3-infected group

126

revealed expected lesions such as atrophy, inflammation, necrosis, and mineralization, whereas in

127

the CFA group, only 10% (1/10) of the animals had detectable lesions (Table 1, bottom panel, and

128

Figure 2). Taken together, the findings that animals immunized with CFA alone were protected

129

against both myocarditis and pancreatitis induced with CVB3 supports the idea that non-specific

130

priming of the immune system with adjuvants like CFA may be sufficient to prevent virus

131

infections.

147

expected to induce antigen-specific immune responses to prevent infection with CVB3.

148

Historically, CFA containing M. tb has been used as a powerful immune-stimulating adjuvant, and

149

it contains immunoreactive molecules, such as N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine

150

(muramyl dipeptide) and trehalose 6,6ʹ-dimycolate, all of which promote Th1 cell polarization by

151

inducing IFN-γ [19-21]. Reports indicate that the BCG bacterium can enhance immunogenicity

152

and also promote type 1 IFN response as shown in various settings such as vaccinations against

153

influenza and hepatitis B viruses in humans [22, 23], and infection studies with

154

encephalomyocarditis, murine hepatitis (mouse coronavirus), type 1 and 2 herpes simplex,

155

vaccinia and foot-and-mouth disease viruses in mice [24-29]. Additionally, bacterial CpG

156

nucleotides promote Th1 (IFN-γ) response [30], which is critical for protection against intracellular

157

pathogens and viruses through the production of interleukin-12 by interacting with toll-like

158

receptor-9 [31, 32]. Thus, we believe that the disease-protective ability of CFA may reflect non-

159

antigen-specific effects attributable to the adjuvanticity of M. tb.

Disease protection offered by CFA was rather perplexing to explain, because CFA was not

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.27.120121; this version posted May 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

160

However, our data point to a few other possible mechanisms: (i) Exposure to non-specific

161

infections that promote Th1 cytokine responses may offer protection against viral infections

162

possibly by preventing viral replication [20, 21, 33]. If this holds true, then our data may also

163

potentially provide credence to the hygiene hypothesis [34, 35]. (ii) A growing body of evidence

164

suggests that the trained innate memory may be an important property of the innate immune

165

system. Myeloid cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, Natural killer (NK) cells, NK-T cells,

166

γδ T cells, and possibly innate lymphoid cells, exposed to a microbe ‒ for example, ‘x’ microbe ‒

167

can robustly respond to this microbe upon re-exposure, and also for other unrelated microbial

168

stimulations through epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming pathways [36-38]. Consistent with

169

this notion, it has been shown that BCG vaccine can offer protection against other unrelated

170

pathogens, such as Candida albicans, Schistosoma mansoni and Staphylococcus aureus [39-42],

171

including autoimmune diseases such as Type I Diabetes and multiple sclerosis [43-47].

172

Conversely, it is also possible that exposure to one type of pathogen can suppress immune

173

responses to entirely different types of pathogens. For example, co-administration of oral polio

174

vaccine with BCG at birth can diminish the response to purified protein derivative from BCG [48].

175

Although whether or not it is currently known that trained innate memory is an underlying

176

mechanism for CFA effects as noted in our studies, this aspect may need to be investigated.

177

Finally, it may be noted that the ongoing pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 has offered new

178

insights in regard to BCG vaccination, in that morbidities and mortalities appear to be low in BCG

179

vaccine recipients [8]. Although the practice of BCG vaccination varies widely across the globe

180

[49, 50], isolated reports showing an evidence of an inverse relationship between BCG

181

vaccinations and

182

(Supplementary Table 1) [8, 9]. But, such a relationship could be contributed by the confounding

COVID-19 attributable mortalities as noted in few countries, if not all

183

factors such as demographic and genetic variations in the affected populations, loopholes in the

184

social distancing and quarantine measures, availability of diagnostic tools and prompt reporting of

185

positive cases [51]. Nonetheless, the evolving notion of inverse relationship between BCG and

186

clinical outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) infection

187

that causes COVID-19 raise fundamental questions as to the immunological relationship between

188

the two entities. While the BCG vaccine contains live Mycobacterium bovis (a pathogen of cattle),

189

CFA contains the killed extract of M. tb (a pathogen of humans). Yet all 13 known mycobacterial

190

species, including the two species identified above, show more than 99% nucleotide similarity,

191

suggesting that all of them may have similar adjuvant properties [52, 53]. Thus, our data may

192

provide experimental evidence for the notion that certain degree of resistance to COVID-19

193

infection in BCG vaccine recipients may be attributable to the adjuvant effects of mycobacteria

194

that may involve the trained innate memory. If this notion holds true, then it creates opportunities

195

to use BCG or its ingredients, such as CpG nucleotides, as anti-viral compounds. To this end,

196

several phase III clinical trials have been initiated in a number of countries to test whether the BCG

197

vaccination can offer protection or alter prognosis of COVID-19 infection [51, 54]. However, it

198

should be noted that BCG vaccination is performed at birth, whereas COVID-19 infection tends

199

to be more common in the elderly population [55, 56]. Although existence of multiple co-

200

morbidities may explain fatalities in these patient populations, the data also lead to the question

201

whether beneficial effects of BCG can last so long. Additionally, readers are urged to cautiously

202

interpret the direct translational significance of our findings to humans, since CVB3 and SARS

203

CoV-2 are two different viruses. Thus, evaluation of the effect of BCG in appropriate animal

204

models that capture the disease phenotypes of humans in response to SARS Cov-2 may provide

205

more definitive information.

206

One limitation of our study is that we did not investigate the presence of virus in tissues of

207

CVB3-infected mice. Similarly, it is unknown whether CFA administration can potentiate the

208

production of protective neutralizing antibodies to CVB3, and if so, how long such an effect would

209

last against different doses of virus. Likewise, whether administration of CFA in the face of CVB3

210

infection can mitigate the disease process is also unknown. At the time of this writing, we could

211

not execute these experiments since our institutional guidelines do not allow any new animal

212

experiments because of the ongoing threat of COVID-19 to the public. Nonetheless, our data may

213

provide insights into our understanding of the occurrence of viral infections in the face of pre-

214

existing, non-antigen-specific immune responses generated in response to a potentially wide range

215

of environmental pathogens/microbes or gut microbiota over a period of time, which also may

216

include formation of virtual memory cells [57, 58].
