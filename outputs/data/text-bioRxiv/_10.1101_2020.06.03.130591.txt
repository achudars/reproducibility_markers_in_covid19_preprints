Abstract
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has caused the current COVID-19 pandemic with catastrophic societal impact.
Because many individuals shed virus for days before symptom onset, and many show mild or no symptoms, an
emergent and unprecedented need exists for development and deployment of sensitive and high throughput
molecular diagnostic tests. RNA-mediated oligonucleotide Annealing Selection and Ligation with next
generation DNA sequencing (RASL-seq) is a highly multiplexed technology for targeted analysis of
polyadenylated mRNA, which incorporates sample barcoding for massively parallel analyses. Here we present a
more generalized method, capture RASL-seq (“cRASL-seq”), which enables analysis of any targeted pathogen(and/or host-) associated RNA molecules. cRASL-seq enables highly sensitive (down to ~1-100 pfu/ml or cfu/ml)
and highly multiplexed (up to ~10,000 target sequences) detection of pathogens. Importantly, cRASL-seq
analysis of COVID-19 patient nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens does not involve nucleic acid extraction or
reverse transcription, steps that have caused testing bottlenecks associated with other assays. Our simplified
workflow additionally enables the direct and efficient genotyping of selected, informative SARS-CoV-2
polymorphisms across the entire genome, which can be used for enhanced characterization of transmission
chains at population scale and detection of viral clades with higher or lower virulence. Given its extremely low
per-sample cost, simple and automatable protocol and analytics, probe panel modularity, and massive scalability,
we propose that cRASL-seq testing is a powerful new surveillance technology with the potential to help mitigate
the current pandemic and prevent similar public health crises.

Introduction
Several RNA viruses have emerged in recent decades as threats to human health on a global scale (e.g. HIV,
MERS, SARS, Ebola, Zika).1, 2 In each case, the impact of these viruses would likely have been substantially
mitigated by more effective surveillance technologies and contact tracing programs. In the early stages of the
COVID-19 pandemic, widely available testing and contact tracing could have blunted the explosive growth of new
cases. The public health crisis has been exacerbated by lack of critical supplies in some regions, including the
RNA extraction kits required for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based molecular
testing. At the time of this writing, the United States has reported nearly 2 million confirmed cases, over 100,000
COVID-19 related deaths, and over 40 million Americans have applied for unemployment. It is widely recognized
that the development of a comprehensive testing infrastructure for large-scale diagnosis and surveillance, which
is rapidly reconfigurable for emerging threats, is essential to ending the current pandemic and to preventing
future crises due to emerging pathogens.
Current nucleic acid tests (NATs) for SARS-CoV-2 have key limitations. Traditional RT-PCR is relatively
inexpensive, but requires a separate labor and time-intensive RNA extraction step prior to nucleic acid
amplification. Cartridge-based nucleic-acid tests offer rapid results and minimal sample preparation, but
production of cartridges and low-throughput instruments limit scalability; further, most current testing
platforms feature single pathogen targets and do not provide strain or clade-level information. Multiplexed PCR
platforms and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) technologies have demonstrated some
advantages for diagnosing infections compared with more traditional approaches, but cost, low sensitivity, and
complicated informatics have limited adoption for routine use.3 Platforms such as BioFire, Genmark ePlex and
TaqMan array cards are able to identify up to 20-30 targets at a time, but their high per-sample costs (exceeding
$100/test), as well as their inherently low sample throughput, severely limit their utility in the setting of the
large-scale surveillance efforts.4-7 In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, innovative techniques involving
targeted use of NGS have been reported, such as “SwabSeq”8 and “LAMP-Seq”9. While these methods are
promising for detection of SARS-CoV-2, they may not be well suited to syndromic panel (multiplex) testing or
generalized surveillance, and may provide only limited clade-level information.
Analysis of pathogen-associated RNA, versus DNA, can be valuable for several reasons. A large fraction of
clinically important viruses, such as coronaviruses, have RNA genomes, and many have no DNA stage of their
lifecycle. All of the viral NIAID Emerging Infectious Diseases Category A and B pathogens are RNA viruses.10
Further, viral mRNA can also be detected from DNA viruses that cause disease, and may provide a diagnostic
advantage over DNA testing by distinguishing between active and latent infections.11, 12 For cellular pathogens,
abundant RNA sequences, such as ribosomal RNA sequences, provide biological amplification compared to
analysis of the organism’s genomic DNA, thereby enhancing detection sensitivity.13, 14 In addition, RNA typically
degrades rapidly outside of cells, permitting differentiation between living organisms and
environmental/reagent contaminants. Compared with DNA, RNA tends to be shorter and usually exists in single
stranded form, making it more amenable to techniques involving probe hybridization. Finally, simultaneous
analysis of viral and host mRNA expression has been shown to provide additional, clinically useful diagnostic
and prognostic information about disease states.15-17 Importantly, the RNA analysis method presented here
avoids nucleic acid extraction, which is an advantage since limited supplies of the reagents needed for this step
of analysis has contributed to the disruption of large-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing efforts in the United States.18
Several years ago, we and others described a modified RNA-mediated oligonucleotide Annealing, Selection,
and Ligation with next-generation sequencing (RASL-seq) assay chemistry with enhanced sensitivity. This
efficient reaction utilizes the T4 RNA Ligase 2 (Rnl2), which despite being an RNA ligase, efficiently catalyzes
ligation of a DNA donor probe and a chimeric acceptor probe composed of two bases of ribonucleotides at the
ligation junction (Fig. 1A).19-23 In addition to the high sensitivity required for pathogen detection, RASL-seq also
enables very high levels of probe set multiplexing, potentially providing the means for simultaneous analysis of
pathogens, their ancestral lineages, and host immune response (Fig. 1B). By incorporating DNA barcodes into
the primers used to amplify the ligation products, a high level of sample multiplexing is achievable, which enables
very high sample throughput and extremely low per-sample cost.
In any probe ligation assay, it is important that excess probe be removed or destroyed in order to reduce the
amount of non-specific background probe ligation.24, 25, 26 In contrast to previously published methods, we have
incorporated the oligonucleotide-mediated capture of pathogen-associated RNA molecules, in an assay we refer
to as “capture RASL-seq” or “cRASL-seq” (Fig. 1C). By separating targeted from untargeted RNA molecules, and
thus hybridized from un-hybridized ligation probes, cRASL-seq permits extremely high assay specificity, which
is especially important in the setting of diagnosing infectious diseases – particularly relevant in the early phases
of an emerging pathogen threat when community prevalence is low. This method of target capture is distinct
from RASL-seq analysis, which relies on immobilized oligo-dT for non-specific capture of polyadenylated mRNA.

We have previously demonstrated that libraries of ligation products are amplified with uniform efficiency,25
so that PCR spike-ins enable precise quantification of the copies of each ligation product formed prior to
amplification. Quantification of target molecules has proven useful in clinical settings, in determining the burden
of organism(s) within a clinical specimen. Furthermore, we demonstrate how cRASL-seq probes can be used for
simultaneous SARS-CoV-2 detection and SNP genotyping, which has utility for tracking chains of viral
transmission. Recognizing the urgent need for large-scale testing at minimal cost, we have optimized and
characterized the performance of a streamlined, extraction-free protocol for direct analysis of nasopharyngeal
(NP) swab specimens obtained from COVID-19 patients.
Results
We first determined whether the standard RASL-seq assay, which does not involve RNA extraction, was
compatible with analysis of COVID-19 patient mRNAs present in NP swab specimens, a matrix not previously
analyzed using an oligonucleotide probe ligation technique. To this end, we utilized a large panel of RASL-seq
probe sets designed to characterize human immune responses in a variety of settings (Table S1). A pool of 1,736
probe sets targeting 240 genes, 154 of which were assessed by analysis of exon-exon junction usage, were
included in a standard RASL-seq assay with oligo-dT coated magnetic beads for capture of polyadenylated mRNA
transcripts. In this experiment, an average of 727 (±46) correctly paired probe sets, corresponding to 108 (±4)
genes, were sequenced at least 10 times in a given sample. We observed very high reproducibility among technical
replicates (average R2 = 0.95 ±0.03, Fig. S1). High levels of housekeeping genes were detected as expected, and
patterns of immunoglobulin gene expression could be reliably measured and were consistent among patients
even with very different SARS-CoV-2 viral loads (determined by RT-qPCR, Fig. S2). These findings indicated
that cRASL-seq analysis of non-polyadenylated, pathogen-associated RNA molecules might also be possible
using unextracted NP swab specimens.
We determined the dynamic range of the cRASL-seq assay for detection of from 101 to 108 spiked-in target
RNA molecules, observing exceptional linear performance over this range (Fig. 1D, R2 = 0.98). To make the
cRASL-seq protocol as fast and inexpensive as possible, we performed extensive optimization to minimize the
time and reagents required for each step (Fig. 1C, Fig. S3A-C), without compromising assay sensitivity.
We next tested the performance of the cRASL-seq assay in detecting influenza A virus in blinded, previously
characterized NP swabs obtained by the Johns Hopkins Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and
Surveillance (JH-CEIRS). To detect influenza A, we designed a cRASL-seq probe set targeting a conserved
sequence within the M-segment, according to our previously-established design principles.19 A PCR spike-in
standard was added at a known concentration to enable precise calculation of the ligation product copy number.
Upon specimen unblinding, we observed large numbers of reads mapping onto the correctly paired M-segment
probe set in all samples that contained either H1N1 or H3N2 influenza virus (Fig. 1E). In contrast, either zero
or a small number of reads mapped to the negative control samples, providing a large signal-to-noise ratio that
ranged from 103 to 106.
We wondered to what extent we could multiplex target capture probes, since we expected magnetic capture
bead capacity to limit the level of multiplexing achievable. In order to model increasing probe pool complexity,
we serially diluted the influenza M-segment biotinylated capture probe (maintained at a standard 5 pM
concentration) into a background of an irrelevant biotinylated capture probe at a concentration increasing up to
the binding capacity of the streptavidin coated magnetic beads used in the assay. We compared the signal of the
M-segment probe in the single-plex assay (no additional capture probe) to that observed in the model
multiplexed assays. We observed >90% of the single-plex signal even in a background of 10,000-fold excess
irrelevant capture probe (Fig. 1F). While we have not explicitly tested higher levels of ligation probe multiplexing
in this study, previous RASL-seq studies have employed panels of >5,000 probe sets.27 With appropriate design
of non-interfering capture and ligation probe sets, we thus anticipate that we could achieve multiplexing of up to
10,000 probe sets, without technical artifacts.
Having established that cRASL-seq could, in principle, be leveraged into a sophisticated infectious disease
diagnostics platform, we next set out to determine whether a universal protocol could be employed for diverse
classes of pathogens. Important human pathogens come from all kingdoms of life. We therefore tested the
streamlined, extraction-free cRASL-seq protocol for detection of the following: fungal organisms (Candida
albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans) using ITS and 26S/18S rRNA (Fig. 2A-B); acid fast bacteria
(Mycobacterium smegmatis) (Fig. 2C), gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) (Fig. 2D), and gram
negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae) using 16S rRNA (Fig. 2E-F); DNA
virus (Human cytomegalovirus) using pp65, US34, UL5, and UL22A mRNA (Fig. 2G); and RNA virus (Zika
virus) using genomic RNA (Fig. 2H). Each organism was spiked into a separate reaction in serial dilution. The

combined pool of 116 probes targeting all the RNAs were tested together in each reaction (Table S2). Negative
control reactions included full reactions without any added organism (“no template control”, NTC), as well as
reactions containing the organisms but lacking the Rnl2 enzyme during the ligation step (“no ligase control”,
NLC). We considered an organism detected whenever the sum of the probes’ normalized read counts was 10-fold
higher than the corresponding normalized read counts from the NTC sample. In each case, we observed a strong
linear correlation between normalized read counts and organism input amount across several logs of abundance,
down to limits of detection that ranged from ~1.5 to ~150 colony or plaque forming units per milliliter (Table
1). cRASL-seq can therefore be used to detect a broad range of pathogens with clinically relevant sensitivity,
using a universal, nucleic acid extraction free protocol.
Analysis of pathogen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has utility for distinguishing closely related
organisms (e.g. human and zoonotic brucellosis), in tracing chains of viral transmission, and for detecting cladespecific differences in virulence. We therefore tested the ability of cRASL-seq probes to directly genotype SNPs
from SARS-CoV-2 RNA in COVID-19 patient NP swab specimens. Genotyping probe sets were designed to share
a single 3’ acceptor probe, which could pair with two alternative 5’ phospho-donor probes corresponding to the
alternative genotypes (Fig 3A, Table S3). We placed the SNP recognition site in the center of the phosphodonor probe to maximally destabilize binding of the mismatched probe. Biotinylated capture probes were also
designed to anneal within 200 nt of each genotyping probe set, to allow for some level of RNA degradation. In a
proof-of-concept study, we designed genotyping probes for the 20 most entropic SARS-CoV-2 SNPs reported in
the Nextstrain database28 (queried on 3/16/2020). These 20 SNPs span the majority of the SARS-CoV-2 genome,
ranging from genomic position 241 to 29,095.
For each SNP, the number of reads from the reference (“wildtype”) probe sequence is compared against the
number of reads obtained from the non-reference (“mutant”) probe sequence. If one of the probe sets is
preferentially incorporated into the ligation product (fold-difference > 1.5; p-value < 0.001, binomial test), the
base is called and assigned to the position. If the probes do not have sufficient reads or they are not significantly
different, no base is called and a “wildcard” is assigned to the position. The string of assigned bases and wildcards
are then compared to the strings of corresponding bases from each SARS-CoV-2 genome deposited in the GISAID
database (Figs. 3A, S5). The genotyping assay was first tested using purified reference SARS-CoV-2 gRNA. At
the highest input concentration, 2x105 copies per reaction, 14 of the 20 bases were called in both technical
replicates, and these genotypes matched perfectly to the sequence of the isolate from which it originated
(hCoV19/USA/WA1/2020|EPI_ISL_404895|20200119, Fig. 3B). As the input gRNA amount decreased,
significantly fewer bases were called with high confidence. We assessed the reproducibility of the assay by testing
8 NP swab specimens in duplicate and comparing the results (Fig. S4). All technical replicates agreed with each
other at a cutoff of 5 SNPs called.
We used the 20 SNP SARS-CoV-2 genotyping panel to analyze 40 NP swab specimens obtained from patients
with RT-qPCR proven COVID-19. Of these, 5 or more SNPs could be called in 35 of the samples. These genotypes
are displayed in Fig. 3C. To better understand the relationships among the observed genotypes, we used a
network graph approach in which genotypes (nodes) are linked (share a connection) if they do not differ in any
of the called SNPs (Fig. 3D). Using this network analysis, and by calculating the maximal independent vertex
set, we were able to conclude that the infections among these 35 cases could be attributable to at least 9 distinct
SARS-CoV-2 ancestral lineages, and thus at least that many distinct chains of local transmission. The reference
Washington State isolate was unconnected to our Baltimore network. The observed genotypes could additionally
be associated with geographic locations, based on their matches to sequenced isolates in the GISAID database
(Fig. S5).
Finally, we wondered whether viral load could be simultaneously estimated using data from genotyping
probe sets alone. After background subtraction using no ligase controls and seasonal coronavirus samples, a
probe set targeting a SNP in the nucleocapsid gene reported positive values in all 40 PCR+ samples (100%
detection sensitivity). Furthermore, Fig. 3E illustrates how well correlated these values are with RT-qPCR Ct
values (R2=0.84), indicating that cRASL-seq can be used to simultaneously determine viral load and viral
genotype at high sensitivity, high throughput and very low cost.
Discussion
We have developed a generalized version of the RASL-seq technology, called “capture RASL-seq” or “cRASLseq”, and demonstrated its utility for highly multiplexed molecular analyses of pathogens and host responses
directly from NP swab specimens, using a universal and streamlined protocol that does not require up-front
nucleic acid extraction or reverse transcription. The cRASL-seq protocol can easily be performed manually in a
biosafety cabinet, does not require centrifugation or vortex steps that risk aerosolizing virus, does not rely on any

specialized equipment, and incorporates easily scalable sample barcoding to dramatically reduce per-sample
sequencing cost and increase throughput. Though not implemented here, the simple workflow can be easily
automated using liquid handling instrumentation. For relatively low complexity probe panels, for example a
simple SARS-CoV-2 panel, tens of thousands of sequencing reads per sample may provide sufficient sensitivity.
A high output Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument run, which can generate up to 1010 single end reads, would
therefore provide sufficient depth to analyze >100,000 samples at once. Another advantage of the cRASL-seq
methodology is the extremely low per-probe assay concentration of 5 pM. A typical 100 nmol oligonucleotide
synthesis scale will therefore yield a sufficient quantity of probe for tens of millions of 100 µl cRASL-seq tests, at
a per-test probe cost below one cent. The major cost-driving components of the reaction are the ligase,
polymerase and magnetic beads. Enzyme production could be scaled up to reduce costs, while less expensive
streptavidin capture matrices may be adapted to replace the magnetic beads. At the scale of millions of tests, it
is therefore feasible to reduce the per-test reagent and sequencing costs to below one US dollar.
Obtaining SARS-CoV-2 genotype information as part of a large-scale surveillance effort would have key
benefits. Capturing viral genetics could potentially identify chains of transmission, enabling more effective
contact tracing and policymaking, while also detecting and tracking emerging clades with enhanced or
diminished virulence. There is also intense investigation into the role that host genetics plays in COVID-19
disease severity. As these genotypes are defined, RASL-seq probes that distinguish host alleles could be
additionally incorporated into the assay. In this study, we separated the cRASL-seq analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and
the RASL-seq analysis of host immune responses into two separate reactions. However, by designing noninterfering probe panels and balancing the proportion of streptavidin coated magnetic beads, versus oligo-dT
coated magnetic beads, it should be straightforward to perform the two assays simultaneously in a single reaction.
The cRASL-seq methodology is not without limitations. While we have demonstrated a sensitivity comparable
to single-plex RT-qPCR, the limits of detection are governed by overall sequencing depth, which can be reduced
by consumption of reads from highly abundant ligation products (due to a high load of a co-infecting virus for
example). However, since the ligation products are all amplified with a high degree of uniformity, simple RNA
spike-in or PCR spike-in sequences can be used to determine the lower limit of detection sensitivity for each
reaction. Analysis of host transcripts can also be used to assess sample acquisition sufficiency, a known source
of false negative test results.29 Another important concern for COVID-19 molecular diagnostics is the turnaround
time. When NGS is used to read out the cRASL-seq assay, the testing turnaround time is unlikely to be less than
~24 hours with currently available instrumentation. Per-sample sequencing cost considerations will favor
analysis of large sample batches, which could further increase turnaround times. For large-scale regional and
national level surveillance purposes however, an occasional one to two days of self-quarantine while awaiting
test results may be acceptable, given the costs and limitations associated with alternative methods. Faster, nonNGS-based readouts of cRASL probe ligation products may also be developed. For example, isothermal
amplification, followed by array or test-strip hybridization may prove more applicable in the point-of-care setting.
Regardless of the readout, a robust, rapidly reconfigurable, multiplexed, inexpensive and high sample
throughput platform for molecular surveillance, such as the one described here, will facilitate curbing the
COVID-19 pandemic and preventing future outbreaks from becoming pandemics.
Materials and Methods
Probe design and synthesis. For each target sequence from the reference organisms (target sequences described
in Results, and Supplemental Table S4), we identified 40-mer sites for ligation probes using CATCH.30 To avoid
overlapping probes, we set a stride of 40, allowing no mismatches and bypassing the cover extension in the
design.py program (-pl 40 -l 40 -ps 40 -m 0 -e 0). We excluded probes that aligned against any target sequences
from the other organisms, with an e-value smaller than 10-3, using MMseqs2.31 A similar design pipeline was
employed for 20-mer capture probes with a final filter step to remove any overlapping ligation and capture
probes. Finally, ligation and capture probes were filtered for binding properties using previously reported
Primer3 conditions.19 The design of the immunoglobulin gene expression probe panel was reported previously.19
Ligation probes and capture probes (3’-diribonucleotide terminated acceptor probes, 5’ phosphorylated probes,
and biotinylated capture probes) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coraville, IA 52241, USA).
Probes were diluted in water to 100 µM, mixed in equimolar amounts to create multiplexed panels, and then
aliquoted and stored at -80ºC (Table S1-S3).
Spike-ins and reference organisms. The synthetic PCR spike-in sequence used for determining molecular
equivalents is a 74 nt oligo with a pseudo 40 nt ligated sequence flanked by the external 17 nt PCR1 primer

5’-GGAGCTGTCGTTCACTCTGTCTCGGAGCTTACAGTrArUTGACACTCAATCGGTCGCGTAGATCGGAAGAGCACAC-3’). The 40 nt irrelevant internal sequence is a
scrambled version of a ligated GAPDH probe set. Reference organisms were purchased from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) (Table S4). Organisms were reconstituted according to protocols
provided by ATCC, aliquoted into single-use samples and stored at -80ºC until used. The Zika virus isolate was
from a patient in Cali, Colombia, and was grown in Vero-E6 cells. The infectious titer of the virus (7.1 x 106
pfu/mL) was determined in the culture supernatant by a plaque assay. The full-length GAPDH ORF (RefSeq:
NM_002046.6) was subcloned into a custom vector, linearized and transcribed in vitro using the Hi-Scribe T7
High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA). GAPDH IVT-RNA was purified by precipitation with lithium
chloride followed by column purification using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, DE). Purified GAPDH IVTRNA was quantified by nanodrop, aliquoted into single-use samples and stored at -80ºC until used for the
dynamic range experiments.
Nasopharyngeal swab specimens. NP swab specimens were collected from patients after informed written
consent was obtained, under a protocol approved by the local governing human research protection committee.
The Johns Hopkins Influenza Research and Surveillance (JH-CEIRS) program’s human subjects protocol was
approved by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB): IRB90001667 and NIH
Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases: Protocol 15-0103. Unextracted NP swab specimens (n=9) were
de-identified, blinded and provided for further analysis. Secondary use of all unextracted COVID-19 patient NP
swab specimens (n = 40) was exempted by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Institutional Review
Board protocol (IRB00086059, and IRB00221396, Table S4). An RT-qPCR diagnostic test (RealStar® from
Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany)32 was performed on all COVID-19 patient NP swab specimens used in
this study. NP swab specimens were stored either at -20ºC or -80ºC.
cRASL and RASL assays. Samples (39 µL) were added to 61 µL of a hybridization reaction mix containing 1XSSC, 5 pM of each ligation and capture probe, 40 U of Protector RNase Inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany) and 50 µL of 2X DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research, Irvine CA) in a total reaction volume of 100 µL.
Reactions were heated for 5 min at 95ºC followed by 20 min annealing at 45ºC. 5 µL of a 50/50 slurry of
streptavidin coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads MyOne C1, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA) in 1x-PBS
was added to each cRASL reaction and incubated with gentle shaking for 15 min at room temperature. To each
RASL reaction, 5 µL of Oligo-(dT)25 beads (Dynabeads, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA) were added and
incubated with gentle shaking for 15 min at 25ºC. Beads were collected on a magnet for 2 minutes and washed
twice with 1X-SSC buffer, followed by a final wash with 1X Rnl2 reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2,
5 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP, pH 7.6). 10 µL of the ligation reaction containing 30 U of Rnl2 (Enzymatics, Beverly MA)
in 1X Rnl2 buffer was incubated with the beads in suspension for 20 min at 37ºC. Following ligation, beads were
collected for 2 min on a magnet and then resuspended in 25 µL PCR master mix containing PCR1 primers and
Herculase-II (Agilent, Santa Clara CA). PCR cycling was as follows: an initial denaturing step at 95ºC for 2 min,
followed by 30 cycles of: 95ºC for 20 s, 53.5ºC for 30 s, 72ºC for 30 s, with a final extension of 72ºC for 3 min.
Two microliters of the pre-amplification product were used as input to a 20 µL dual-indexing PCR reaction for
10 cycles with primers containing 8-mer i5 and 8-mer i7 barcodes and the P5/P7 Illumina adapters. PCR cycling
was as follows: an initial denaturing step at 95ºC for 2 min, followed by 10 cycles of: 95ºC for 20 s, 58ºC for 30
s, 72ºC for 30 s, with a final extension of 72ºC for 3 min.
Library preparation and sequencing. Barcoded PCR products were analyzed individually or as a pool on a 3%
agarose gel to confirm amplicon size and purity. Barcoded PCR products were pooled and purified using
NucleoSpin PCR Clean-up columns (Mackery Nagel, Duren DE). Pooled libraries were sequenced on an Illumina
NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina, La Jolla CA), using a single-end 50-cycle protocol with a custom read 1
sequencing primer and custom i5/i7 sequencing primers as previously described.17
Quantification of ligation products. Relative quantification of ligated products (molecular equivalents) were
calculated using a synthetic PCR spike-in (described above), which was added to PCR1 reactions at 3,000 or
5,000 molecules/reaction. For samples measured by qPCR, molecular equivalents were calculated using the
following equation: 2"#$%&'()* "$%+(,-.(/0 12&'()* where Nspike is the molecules of spike-in added to PCR1 reactions.
For samples analyzed by sequencing, a pseudocount was added to each probe set’s read count and the molecular
equivalents were calculated by taking the ratio of ligation product read count to spike-in read count, multiplied
by the molecules of spike-in added to the PCR1 reaction. For comparison of read counts with Ct values, we
performed baseline subtraction on spike-in normalized probe values by subtracting the maximum normalized

value of each probe from the four negative samples (two no ligase controls and two seasonal coronavirus samples).
The corrected values of the best performing genotyping probe set, which targets the N gene at genome position
28,688, was plotted against clinically-determined SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR Ct values. We fit an exponential
regression to the data, and graphed the resulting data points and regression on a semilog plot. For analysis of
host gene expression, psuedocounted and GAPDH-normalized values were obtained for each probe set. For the
analysis of Ig gene expression, the normalized values of all probe sets corresponding to each Ig (3 probes each
for IGHA, IGHD, IGHE, and IGHM, and 8 probes for IGHG1-4) were summed to obtain the final values plotted
in Fig. S2.
Analysis of sequencing data. Sequencing reads were trimmed to the first 40 bases, demultiplexed and aligned
against a reference database of the intended ligation products using exact matching. Genotyping data was
analyzed as follows. Genotyping probe pairs were evaluated using an exact binomial test with a null model of
equal abundance between the wild type probe and the mutant probe. A SNP was called if the binomial p-value
was <0.001, the total reads mapped to the probe pair was >100, and the fold change between the probes was >1.5.
A locus with read counts that failed any of these criteria was not called, and thus considered a “wildcard”. Each
set of 20 SNP calls and wildcards is referred to as the SARS-CoV-2 genotype associated with a given sample. We
utilized a network graph-based approach to visualize the relationships of genotypes detected in the Baltimore
COVID-19 cohort. Genotypes were represented as nodes and were connected if there was no disagreement
between the pair of genotypes (wildcards could match anything). We utilized the R package igraph to determine
which set of samples would result in the largest number of unique genotypes (the “maximal independent vertex
set”).

Supplemental Figure 3. Optimization of the cRASL-seq assay. 1,000 pfu of H1N1 influenza virus collected via
nasopharyngeal swab was used in standard cRASL reactions together with probe sets targeting the influenza Msegment. All reactions were analyzed by qPCR probes specific for the ligated product. A. Effects on RNA
templated and non-templated ligation efficiency with varying Rnl2 amounts (0, 7.5, 15, and 30 units) and Rnl2
ligation times (5, 10, and 20 minutes). B. Effects of varying post-ligation wash steps and sample-reagent reaction
storage times. C. Effects of varying hybridization times (20, 30, and 60 minutes). NTC, no template control. Wash,
1x-SSC. BE, buffer exchange into Rnl2 reaction buffer. Premade, complete cRASL reaction stored for 24 hours at
room temperature prior to start of assay. All reactions were performed in duplicate, averages are plotted.

Supplemental Figure 4. Network graph analysis of replica SNP-genotyping data. Nodes
represent sample genotypes and are linked if they do not have conflicting SNPs at any position
(as in Fig. 3D). Technical replicas are distinguished by color. Samples lacking sufficient called SNPs were
not included (A. 5 SNPs to pass QC, B. 3 SNPs to pass QC).

Supplemental Figure 5. Alignment of detected SARS-CoV-2 genotypes against the GISAID
database. A. Comparison of 20 SNP genotypes (columns) detected in Figure 3C against
genotypes present in the GISAID database (rows). Rows were hierarchically clustered; column
order is maintained from Fig. 3C. A match (box shaded black) means there were no conflicting
SNPs between the sample and GISAID genotype. Independent genotypes (1-9) and reference



isolate ( ) are indicated below, as in Fig. 3C. B. Heatmap linking GISAID genotypes (rows, same
order as in A) with geographic location (columns), requiring exact matching to at least one isolate
from the geographic region.
