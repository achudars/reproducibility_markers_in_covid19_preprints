ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the emergent SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus threatens global public health
and there is an urgent need to develop safe and effective vaccines. Here we report the generation and
the preclinical evaluation of a novel replication-defective gorilla adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding
the pre-fusion stabilized Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV2. We show that our vaccine candidate, GRAdCOV2, is highly immunogenic both in mice and macaques, eliciting both functional antibodies which
neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection and block Spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor, and a robust, Th1dominated cellular response in the periphery and in the lung. We show here that the pre-fusion stabilized
Spike antigen is superior to the wild type in inducing ACE2-interfering, SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies.
To face the unprecedented need for vaccine manufacturing at massive scale, different GRAd genome
deletions were compared to select the vector backbone showing the highest productivity in stirred tank
bioreactors. This preliminary dataset identified GRAd-COV2 as a potential COVID-19 vaccine candidate,
supporting the translation of GRAd-COV2 vaccine in a currently ongoing Phase I clinical trial
(NCT04528641).

INTRODUCTION
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019, and is
responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic which has so far caused worldwide 38,202,956 confirmed cases,
and 1,087,069 deaths, as of October 15th 2020. Despite a growing number of both observational studies
and randomized clinical trials currently running in multiple countries, to date no approved drug is licensed
for the treatment or prevention of the disease, and vaccination is still regarded as a critical global priority.
SARS-CoV-2 is the third novel betacoronavirus in the last 20 years to cause substantial human disease;
however, unlike its predecessors SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 transmits efficiently from personto-person (1). To address the urgent need for a medical countermeasure to prevent the further
dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 we have employed a novel replication defective simian adenoviral vector
generated from a gorilla group C isolate: GRAd32. Viral vectored vaccines are amenable to accelerated
developmental timelines due to the ability to quickly insert a foreign antigen into the E1 region of the viral
genome and rescue the novel vaccine vector in an appropriate production cell line to have it ready for
preclinical testing. In addition, robust GMP production processes are already available, which are easily
scalable to meet the demand for a pandemic vaccine.
Simian adenoviruses derived from Chimpanzee, Bonobo and Gorilla, which are not known to infect or
cause pathological illness in humans, consequently have low/no seroprevalence (0%-18%) in the human
population (2). Prior studies in thousands of human subjects using simian adenoviral vaccine vectors
encoding different antigens (relevant to Ebola, malaria, Hepatitis-C, HIV, and RSV), have shown that this
vaccine platform is safe and can generate potent, durable, and high-quality T-cell and antibody responses
(3) (4) (5) (6) (7). Furthermore, the current pandemic is giving a strong boost to the clinical validation of
the simian adeno-vectored vaccine technology, since the most advanced vaccine candidate in Phase 3
clinical trial, AZD1222, is based on a chimpanzee adenoviral vector, ChAdOx1 (8).
In this study, we generated different genome deletions in the GRAd32 vector backbone and inserted a
transgene cassette containing either the SARS-CoV-2 full length Spike protein (S) or its stabilized form (S2P) (9) to preserve the neutralization-sensitive epitopes at the apex of the pre-fusion structure and to
improve expression levels from transduced cells. The selected COVID-19 candidate vaccine vector, GRAdCOV2, has a genome deleted of the entire E1 and E3 regions and the native E4 region replaced with the
E4 orf6 of human Adenovirus 5. We show here that this modification of the backbone improved vector
productivity using a scalable process in stirred tank bioreactors which is a relevant feature in the context
of a pandemic.
In this study we demonstrate that administering a single dose of GRAd-COV2 to nonhuman primates and
mice we stimulate a Th1 dominant T-cell response, hACE2 receptor blocking antibodies and SARS-CoV-2
neutralizing antibodies. These results support the ongoing clinical development of GRAd-COV2 vaccine for
prevention of COVID-90 19 (NCT04528641).
RESULTS
GRAd32 has low seroprevalence in humans
GRAd32 is a novel simian adenovirus isolated from a captive gorilla. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of
aligned adenoviral polymerase sequences, GRAd32 falls into the group C adenoviruses, as the human Ad5
(Fig 1A). The prevalence of pre-existing immunity to GRAd32 vector and to the common human Ad5 was
estimated in a small set of 40 human sera of US origin by a viral neutralization assay based on secreted

alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene activity (10). Greater than 32% of the serum samples were
negative (IC50 titer <18) for neutralization of GRAd32. In addition, the IC50 titers of the positive sera were
low and only 10% had titers greater than 200 (Fig 1B). Titers less than 200 may not be inhibitory in vivo
(11). In comparison, 84% of serum samples were positive for neutralization of Ad5, with 67,5% of the
positive samples having endpoint titers greater than 200 (Fig 1B).

immunogenicity. Red continuous lines indicate geometric mean. The table shows the absolute numbers and the percentage of
sera with NAb titers to Ad5 or GRAd32 below cut off (<18), between 18 and 200 (<200) and above 200 (>200).

In vitro characterization of GRAd32-based COVID-19 vaccine constructs
We explored different GRAd32 vector backbones encoding the wild type Spike protein (S) (GenBank:
QHD43416.1) or the pre-fusion stabilized S (S-2P) (9) to find the optimal combination in terms of vaccine
immunogenicity and productivity. To this aim, four vaccine variants were generated, named GRAd32b-S,
GRAd32b-S-2P, GRAd32c-S and GRAd32c-S-2P, which differed either in the S protein (wild type or prefusion) or in the vector backbone (GRAd32b: ∆E1, ∆E3 or GRAd32c: ∆E1, ∆E3, ∆E4::hAd5E4orf6) (Fig S1).
In all vectors the viral E1 and E3 regions were deleted to make the virus replication defective and increase
the cloning capacity; the GRAd32c vector backbone was further deleted of the E4 region, which was
replaced with the E4 orf6 of human Ad5 in an attempt to optimize growth rate and yield in human cell
lines, as previously described (12) (13).
The four vaccine vectors were rescued in a suspension adapted HEK293 packaging cell line and in vitro
characterized for productivity, infectivity, genome stability and potency as measured by transgene
expression. To reflect the growth conditions used for large-scale manufacturing, the productivity of the
GRAd32 vector backbones was assessed after infection at controlled MOI in 2 L stirred tank bioreactors,
upon collection at 48hr and 72hr post infection. As shown in Fig 2, substitution of the native E4 region
with the E4orf6 of hAd5, in addition to the deletion of the E3 region, led to an improved yield (3,15e+11
vp/ml vs 7,06e+10 vp/ml) of the GRAD32c vector when harvest was collected at 60-72h after infection.

No difference in terms of genome stability was observed between the two vector backbones, which
remained stable over 10 amplification passages as detected by restriction pattern analysis (Fig S2).
However, GRAd32c showed slightly lower infectivity as measured by hexon staining in HEK293 cells
respect to GRAd32b (vp/ip ratio = 178 and 63, respectively).

Fig. 2 Productivity of GRAd32 backbone variants in 2L bioreactor. Suspension-adapted packaging HEK293 cells were seeded at
5e5 cells/mL and infected at MOI 200. The titer of virus contained in the bulk cell lysates collected at different time points (hours)
after infection was measured by qPCR.

We then investigated the expression potency of the different vaccine vectors by HeLa cell infection and
FACS analysis of whole-cell binding to either an anti-Spike S2 subunit antibody or to the soluble ACE2
receptor, and by Western Blot (WB) analysis of S protein expression in total cell lysates (Fig 3 and Fig S3).
As shown in Figure 3A, 3B and 3E, FACS analysis of anti-S2 binding to whole cells revealed similar levels of
cell surface-display of either S wt or S-2P, independently of the encoding GRAd32 backbone. However, in
each vector backbone the displayed S-2P was clearly more abundant than the wt Spike. Such difference
in the level of antigen expression was not confirmed by WB analysis of total cell lysates using an antibody
directed to the receptor binding domain (RBD) or to the C terminal HA tag, possibly suggesting improved
trafficking to the plasma membrane for the stabilized spike (Fig S3). Notably, a stronger binding of the
recombinant soluble ACE2 receptor to the membrane-displayed S-2P protein was observed with respect
to S wt (Fig 3B, 3C), suggesting that the pre-fusion conformation favors the accessibility to the RBD.
Based on the above described results of in vitro characterization, GRAd32c-S-2P was selected as the
candidate COVID-19 vaccine vector backbone given the higher vector productivity and the improved ACE2
binding of the pre-fusion stabilized Spike protein, and named GRAd-COV2.

GRAd-COV2 induces strong humoral and Th1 dominated cellular immune responses in mice
Preclinical characterization of the immunogenicity of GRAd-COV2 was performed in inbred mice. Groups
of 8 BALB/c mice were vaccinated intramuscularly (IM) with a single dose of GRAd-COV2 at 1x109vp.
Serum samples were taken at week 2 and 5 post vaccination, and total IgG endpoint titers were measured
by ELISA on full length recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and on the Spike RBD. As shown in Fig 4A,
anti-S IgG titers rose rapidly after vaccination and increased over time, and most of the antibody response
was directed against the RBD. Interestingly, an anti-S IgG2a/IgG1 ratio >1 suggested a Th1 polarization of
the immune responses, compared to the strongly Th2 dominated response induced by a vaccination
regimen based on the recombinant S protein in alum (Fig 4B and S4).
Furthermore, the single-dose immunization with GRAd-COV2 elicited functional antibodies that
neutralized the cytopathic effect (CPE) of SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 cells (50% blocking of CPE = 30 – 220
reciprocal serum dilution) and inhibited pseudotyped virus infection in HuH7 cell (90% inhibition of entry
= 260 – 1233 reciprocal serum dilution) (Fig 4C).

Data are expressed as IC50 or IC90, or the reciprocal of serum dilution achieving 50% or 90% neutralization respectively.
Horizontal lines in panels B and C represent geometric mean.

Strong antigen-specific T cell responses were induced by the vaccination and measured by ELISpot and
intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) from splenocytes isolated 5 weeks after immunization and stimulated
with overlapping 15mer peptides. As shown in Fig 5A, IFN-γ secreting T cells recognizing epitopes in both
S1 and S2 domain of Spike protein were detected (mean 1390 and 390 spot forming cells per million
splenocytes respectively). In depth characterization of responding T cell subset (CD8+/CD4+) and Th
polarization by ICS and FACS analysis revealed a 10% mean frequency of IFNγ secreting, Spike-specific
CD8+ T cells, and a lower but clearly measurable Th1 dominated CD4+ T cell response (Fig 5B). Type 2
cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 and IL-17 secretion were also investigated by ICS and ELISpot, but were
undetectable or below the limit of detection of our assays.
To benchmark the potency of the novel GRAd32 vector in comparison with other described simian
adenoviral vectors (12), we have performed a dose-response immunization exploring a range of doses
from 1x109 to 1x105 vp measuring IFN-γ secreting cells by ELISpot in the spleen 3 weeks after vaccination
(Fig S5). Detectable immune responses in all animals were already observed at the dose 1x106 vp,
revealing the strong immunological potency of the new gorilla vector. Notably, strong IFN-γ secreting T
cell responses were also found in the lungs of the GRAd-COV2 vaccinated animals (Fig S5).

We then compared the humoral responses induced by the wt Spike protein versus the S-2P. Sera were
taken five weeks after immunization with a single administration at 1x109 vp of GRAd32 vectors encoding
the wt S or S-2P. We observed similar induction of total anti-S IgG in spite of significantly higher
neutralization titers for the S-2P antigen (Fig 6A) measured by pseudotyped virus neutralization.
Consistently, the same sera assayed for the capacity to interfere with the binding of the soluble ACE2
receptor to the immobilized RBD, showed that the S-2P antigen elicited antibodies with greater
interference capacity (Fig 6B).

GRAd-COV2 immunogenicity in non-human primates
Having determined that GRAd-COV2 elicits neutralizing antibodies and promotes the generation of
multifunctional Th1 biased antigen-specific T cells in mice, we next evaluated the immunogenicity of the
vaccine in a more relevant animal species: non-human primates. Four cynomolgus macaques were
immunized intramuscularly with a single administration of 5x1010vp GRAd-COV2 or GRAd32c-S. Blood was
drawn 1 week before vaccination and at week 2, 4, 6 and 10 after vaccination. Before vaccination all
animals showed different degrees of IgG titers cross-reacting with SARS-CoV2 S and RBD, presumably
deriving from previous contact with other coronaviruses (Fig 7A, 7B). However, serum IgG titers against S
and RBD increased rapidly after vaccination peaking between week 2 and 4 and remained stable up to
week 10 (Fig 7A, 7B). Functional antibodies measured by inhibition of SARS-CoV2 pseudotyped virus
infection in Vero E6 cells and by SARS-CoV2 microneutralization (MN) assay, were also rapidly induced in
all animals and peaked with different kinetics (Fig 7C, 7D). Peak Nab titers ranged between 340 - 1070
(50% CPE in MN assays) and 1580 - 4635 (IC50 pseudotyped virus entry inhibition). Importantly, vaccineinduced neutralization titers remained quite stable throughout the observation period and Nab titers
measured at week 10 were comparable or higher than those measured in serum obtained from COVID19 convalescent patients, using the same MN assay (Fig 7E).

PBMCs were collected 2 and 8 weeks after immunization and T cell response were measured by IFNγ and
IL4 ELISpot assay (Fig 8A). Strong IFN-γ secreting T cells responses were detected in all animals at week 2
(700 – 3500 SFC/106 PBMCs), which somewhat contracted at week 8 but remained at high level (400 –
2500 SFC/106 PBMCs). Instead, IL-4 levels were too low to be detected in macaques by ELISpot analysis
(Fig 8A). The animals immunized with S-2P showed the highest number of IFN-γ secreting T cells (Fig 8B),
and S1 region of the Spike protein was most immunogenic, even in this outbred animal model.
Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) performed on frozen PBMC showed that vaccination primed both CD8+
and CD4+ T cells (Fig 8C).
Overall, the immunogenicity of GRAd-COV2 vaccine in non-human primates is consistent with the mouse
immunogenicity results and further supports the efficacy of the vaccine in promoting the generation of
neutralizing antibodies and Th1 biased cellular responses.

DISCUSSION
In this report we describe the development of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate based on a novel simian
adenovirus, GRAd32, isolated from a captive gorilla and belonging to species C adenoviruses. We show
here that a single immunization with the GRAd-COV2 vector encoding a pre-fusion stabilized S immunogen
(S-2P) in mice and in NHP induced robust NAb responses and cellular immunity. The GRAd-COV2 encoded
S-2P antigen contains the wild type leader sequence, the full-length membrane-bound S with the furin
cleavage site, and two proline stabilizing mutations (9). Stabilizing the pre-fusion conformation of class I
fusion proteins has successfully improved immunogenicity of these important vaccine targets for
respiratory syncytial virus (14), parainfluenza virus (15), Nipah virus (16), MERS-CoV (9), and human

immunodeficiency virus (17). This improvement is based on preserving neutralization-sensitive epitopes
at the apex of pre-fusion structures and it was mainly shown to improve immunogenicity of secreted
fusion proteins. Our data of comparison of the wt versus the stabilized full length, membrane anchored S
protein extend recent preclinical studies of a vectored vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, Ad26.COV2-S, in nonhuman primates (18) wherein a wild type full-length S protein with proline stabilizing mutations (S.PP)
represented the best antigen in terms of immunogenicity and protective efficacy in comparison with
several other S antigen forms. Here we demonstrate that the GRAd vector encoding S-2P shows higher
expression of membrane-anchored antigen in vitro and elicits higher titers of neutralizing antibodies in
mice in comparison to the wt antigen. Similar conclusions cannot yet be drawn for non-human primates
due to the very low number of animals used for this study. A more extended immunization and challenge
study in NHP is ongoing to confirm these observations and, more importantly, to evaluate the protective
efficacy of the vaccine. However, all the vaccinated monkeys responded rapidly to the single vaccine shot
inducing a robust antibody response, which remained sustained up to 10 weeks. A longer observation
period would be required to infer that the NAb responses are long lasting; however, the ongoing clinical
trial of GRAd-COV2 will provide such crucial answer. A single-shot SARS-CoV-2 vaccine would have
important logistic and practical advantages compared with a two-dose vaccine for mass vaccination
campaigns and pandemic control. We speculate here that a species C adenoviral vector could reach this
major objective based on recent reports that human Ad-5 and ChAd3 (both species C) vectors, which in
mice induced the strongest T-cell responses, showed high and persistent antigen expression in the
draining lymph nodes (dLNs), with low innate immunity gene activation (19). Differently, less potent
vaccine vectors, like the ones based on HAdV-28 (species D), HAdV-35 (species B), and ChAd63 (species
E), induced lower antigen expression associated with robust induction of innate immunity genes as
determined by expression profiling in dLNs, that were primarily associated with interferon (IFN) signaling
(19). However, these observations will soon receive a feedback from the clinical testing of several SARSCoV2 vaccine candidates based on different adenoviral vectors.
Our studies do not address the safety or the possibility of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease
or antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (20). However, it is worth noting that the GRAd-COV2
vaccine elicited strong and Th1-biased rather than Th2-biased T cell responses in both mice and nonhuman primates.
Another big challenge posed by the current pandemic is the unprecedented need for scaling up vaccine
manufacturing at massive scale and at record speed. To face this challenge, we generated two backbone
mutants of our gorilla adenovirus: one deleted in E3 and retaining the native entire gorilla adenovirus E4
region, the other deleted in region E3 and with region E4 substituted by the E4 orf6 of human Adenovirus
5. Comparing productivity in bioreactors and stability upon many amplification passages, an optimal
vector backbone (∆E1, ∆E3, ∆E4::hAd5E4orf6) termed GRAd-COV2 has been chosen as the most promising
candidate and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials.

and 0.22µm syringe filtration. The filtered material was inoculated into monolayers of A549 cultivated in
DMEM completed with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% Pen-Strep, and the cultures were visually
monitored for cytopathic effect (CPE) for at least 28 days after inoculation. Cell monolayers showing clear
sign of CPE were detached and subjected to 3 cycles of freeze/thaw (-80°C/37°C) to release the viral
particles. Lysates were then clarified by centrifugation and applied onto fresh A549 to perform a largescale preparation. Purified viral particles were obtained by Ion Exchange (VivaPure® AdenoPACKTM 20,
Sartorius), and the DNA extracted and subjected to Next Generation Sequencing. Group C adenovirus
assignment for GRAd32 was based on a phylogenetic analysis of aligned adenoviral polymerase sequences
using a bootstrap-confirmed Maximum Likelihood tree (500 replicates) calculated with MEGA 10.1.7 (21).
Tree display was performed with iTol (22). Polymerase sequences were aligned with MUSCLE (23).
Vector construction
A pBeloBAC11-based Gorilla Adenovirus-specific shuttle BAC containing the adenoviral genome ends, a
∆E1 cassette and the adenovirus pIX gene was generated as previously described (12). Purified virus
genome was isolated by Proteinase K digestion followed by phenol/chloroform extraction, and
homologous recombination occurring between the right ITR and pIX present on both the shuttle BAC and
the purified viral genome allowed for the insertion of the gorilla adenovirus genome in the shuttle plasmid
with the deletion of the E1 region from bp 445 to 3403. This plasmid was designated as pGRAd32 ΔE1.
Secreted Embryonic Alkaline Phosphatase (SEAP) coding sequence was inserted under the control of the
CMV promoter (including the CMV enhancer) and the bovine Growth Hormone polyadenylation signal in
the E1 locus to generate GRAd32 ΔE1 SEAP.
The pGRAd32 ΔE1 vector was further modified by recombineering to generate the ΔE1ΔE3 (named
“GRAd32b”, with deletion of the E3 region from bp 28479 to bp 32001, encompassing part of the E3 12.5K,
then the entire E3 CR1-alpha, E3 gp19K, E3 CR1-beta, E3 CR1-gamma, E3 RID-alpha, E3 RID-beta and E3
14.7K of the GRAd32 wild type genome) and the ΔE1ΔE3ΔE4 (named “GRAd32c”, with an additional
deletion of the entire E4 region from bp 34144 to 36821, and its substitution with human Adenovirus 5
E4orf6 (12) backbones.
Construction, amplification and purification of GRAd32 vectors expressing SARS-CoV2 spike gene
A human-codon optimized version of the SARS-CoV-2 spike coding sequence was synthesized by Doulix
(Venice, Italy) and subcloned into a shuttle plasmid between the AscI and PacI restriction sites, between
the tetO-hCMV promoter and the Woodchuck Hepatitis Virus (WHP) Post trascriptional Regulatory
Element (WPRE) - bovine Growth Hormone poly(A) (bGHpA) sequence to generate a functional expression
cassette. Two mutations were introduced to convert aa 986-987 KV into 2P, to stabilize the protein in its
pre-fusion state (9). An HA tag, derived from the human influenza hemagglutinin protein, and composed
of a 9-amino acid peptide sequence, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala, was fused downstream of the
last SARS-CoV2 S aa (Thr1273) flanked at its 5’ and 3’ side by a Gly and a Ser, respectively, to facilitate
antigen expression detection by the widely commercially available HA antibodies. In addition, a minimal
Kozak sequence (5’ – CCACC – 3’) was placed immediately upstream of the start codon to enable efficient
initiation of translation. The cassette encoding for either SARS-CoV2 S or SARS-CoV2 S-2P was inserted by
homologous recombination in the E1 locus of the GRAd32b and GRAd32c vectors, thus generating the
GRAd32b-S, GRAd32b-S-2P, GRAd32c-S and GRAd32c-S-2P vectors.
All cloning PCR amplifications were performed using the Q5® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England
Biolabs, Ipswich MA) according to standard procedures.

GRAd32 preAd plasmids were digested with PmeI to release the viral ITRs, and transfected in a suspensionadapted HEK293-based cell line to rescue the virus vector. Vectors were then expanded up to a production
in 2L Bioreactor (Biostat B DCU, Sartorius Stedim Biotech), whereby suspension cells were seeded at 5e5
cells/mL, grown in CD293 complemented with L-Glutamine 6mM (Gibco) and Pluronic F68 0.05% (Gibco)
and infected at MOI 200. The titer of virus contained in the bulk P2 cell lysates collected at 60-72h hours
after the infection was measured by qPCR. Productivity was defined as the ratio between the number of
viral particles quantified by qPCR in the P2 bulk lysate over the number of cells counted at the time of
infection. Finally, P2 purification was performed by VivaPure® AdenoPACKTM 20 (Sartorius), and purified
viral particles used for the infectivity assay (see below).
Infectivity assay
2x105 HEK293 were seeded onto 24well plates previously pre-coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma), and
infected with 2x105, 1x105 or 0.5x105 viral particles. Infected cells were blocked at the indicated time
points with ice-cold methanol, incubated with Anti-Hexon primary antibody (Abcam) followed by
detection with secondary anti-Mouse IgG Peroxidase (Sigma) and Vector NovaRED substrate kit for
peroxidase (Vectorlabs). The infectious unit ratio was determined as the ratio between the number of
stained cells over the number of physical particles used in the assay.
Western Blot
1x106 HeLa cell, cultivated in DMEM completed with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) + 1% Pen/Strep were
infected at MOI 150, collected at the indicated time points, and cell pellets were lysed in appropriate
amount of RIPA buffer (Sigma) completed with protease inhibitor (Roche) for 30’ on ice. Cell lysates were
cleared by centrifugation for 30’ at 15000rpm 4°C, and the supernatant quantified by Bradford (Biorad).
50ug of clarified lysates were loaded onto 4-12% acrylamide gel (Thermo Fisher), transferred onto iBlot 2
NC Mini Stacks membranes (Invitrogen) and incubated with the anti-HA (Abcam) or anti-RBD (Sino
Biological) primary antibodies. Detection of the SARS CoV-2 spike protein was achieved by incubation with
an anti-rabbit (Sigma) secondary antibody, followed by ECL (Invitrogen) incubation, and images were
taken using a Chemidoc (Biorad).
Neutralizing Antibody Assay
Neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers in human sera were assayed as previously described (10). Briefly, 8×104
HEK293 cells per well were seeded in 96 well plates the day before the assay. Each adenoviral vector (Ad5
or GRAd 32) encoding for secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) was preincubated for 1h at 37°C alone or
with serial dilutions of control or test serum samples and then added to the 80-90% confluent 293 cells.
After incubation for 1h at 37°C supernatant was then removed and replaced with 10% FBS in DMEM. SEAP
expression was measured 24 hours later with the chemiluminescent substrate from the Phospha-Light™
kit (Applied Biosystems). Neutralization titers were defined as the dilution at which a 50% reduction of
SEAP activity from serum sample was observed relative to SEAP activity from virus alone.
HeLa cells infection and S2/ACE2 staining:
HeLa cells were plated at 5x105 cells/well in 6-well plates two days prior infection to allow adhesion, then
infected with GRAd vectors at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 150 for 48h. Cells were then harvested by
pipetting with cold PBS+5mM EDTA and aliquoted in 5ml polystyrene FACS tubes (BD biosciences). Cells
were then stained with Live/Dead fixable dye (Invitrogen); recombinant human His-tagged ACE-2 protein

(RayBiotech) was incubated on cells before adding any antibodies, then detected with anti-His antibody
(Sigma). S protein expression was detected with anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit mouse mAb
unconjugated (GeneTex). Antibody binding was detected with goat anti-mouse IgG mAb conjugated with
AlexaFluor 647 fluorochrome (Sigma). Sample acquisition was performed on a LSR Fortessa-X20
cytofluorimeter (BD biosciences) and sample analysis was performed with FlowJo (TreeStar).
Animals and in vivo procedures
Animal husbandry and all experimental procedures were approved by the local animal ethics council and
were performed in accordance with national and international laws and policies on the protection of
animals used for scientific purposes (UE Directive 2010/63/UE; Italian Legislative Decree 26/2014). Mouse
and macaque studies were conducted under Research Projects authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health
(Authorization nr. 1065/2015-PR-mouse and 984/2015-PR-macaques)
Mice: Six-week-old female BALB/c mice purchased from Envigo were acclimatized and housed in
individually vented cages at the Plaisant animal facility (Castel Romano, Rome, Italy). Animal handling
procedures (immunization and bleed) were performed under anesthesia. Animals were divided into
experimental groups of 6 or 8 mice each and immunized with a single administration of different doses of
GRAd-CoV2 (from 1x109 vp to 1x105 vp) or with two administrations two weeks apart of 2.5μg Spike
protein (2019-nCoV Spike Protein-S1+S2 ECD, His tag, SinoBiological) formulated in final 20mg/ml Imject™
Alum Adjuvant (Thermo Scientific) via bilateral intramuscular injections in the quadriceps (50μl per side).
After euthanasia, spleens and lungs were collected and processed into single cell suspensions.
Splenocytes were isolated by mechanical disruption and resuspended in culture medium after red blood
cells lysis by treatment with ACK buffer (Invitrogen). Lung lymphocytes were isolated with Lung
Dissociation kit (Miltenyi) according to manufacturer instruction. In brief: whole lungs were placed in
GentleMACS C tubes and incubated with provided enzymes for 30 minutes at 37°C on GentleMACS
dissociator. Cell suspension was then passed on 70μM MACS SmartStrainer filters (Miltenyi); lymphocytes
were purified by Percoll (GE Healthcare) gradient centrifugation and resuspended in culture medium.
Isolated cells were then used for intracellular cytokine staining after in vitro re-stimulation and/or tested
for IFNγ ELISPOT assay. Mice sera were obtained by standard 30 minutes blood coagulation at room
temperature and centrifugation.
Macaques: The study was conducted at Aptuit srl, Verona in accordance with national legislation, under
approval of the internal Aptuit Committee on Animal Research and Ethics. General procedures for animal
care and housing are in accordance with the current Association for Assessment and Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) recommendations. Four male Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca
fascicularis) originating from Mauritius of approximately 3-4 years of age and 4 to 5 Kg of body weight at
study start were housed in groups of 2 in stainless steel cages, with constant access to environmental
enrichment devices within each cage. Conscious animals were vaccinated in deltoid muscle with a single
dose of 5x1010 vp GRAd-COV2 (group 1, animal id B40/B42) and GRAd32c-S (group 2, animal id B43/B46).
Bleedings were performed from femoral vein. Serum samples were harvested at w-1 (pre-dose-PD), w2,
w4, w6, w10 post injection, obtained by 30 minute coagulation at room temperature and centrifugation
and used for ELISA and in vitro neutralization assays. PBMCs were obtained from blood collected in
Lithium Heparin tubes and isolated by separation on Ficoll gradient (LifeScience); PBMC were harvested
at w-1 (PD), w2, and w8 and used fresh the same day for ex vivo IFNγ/IL4 ELISPOT, or frozen for
intracellular cytokine staining.

SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD ELISA:
SARS-CoV-2 ELISA was developed in-house using His tagged proteins bound on Ni-NTA HisSorb Strips or
Plates (Qiagen). ELISA assay on mouse sera were performed with His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 full length Spike
protein (produced in baculovirus, SinoBiological), while ELISA with monkey sera were performed with a
trimeric his-tagged stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein produced in-house in Expi293 cells or with a
commercial RBD (ACROBiosystems). In brief: optimized amount of proteins in 100μl volume were bound
to Ni-NTA plates/strips for 1h at 25°C in shaking (1 μg/ml for full length Spike, 2 μg/ml for R121, 0.5 μg/ml
for RBD); plates were then incubated with serial dilutions of sera for 2h at 25°C in shaking, then binding
was detected with specific alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse total IgG
and anti-monkey total IgG from Sigma and anti-mouse IgG1 and IgG2a from BD Biosciences). Alkaline
phosphatase substrate was prepared by dissolving SigmaFast (Sigma) tablets in sterile distilled H2O.
Absorbance was read at 405 and 620 nm using EnSight multiple plate reader (PerkinElmer). The endpoint
titer was defined as the highest serum dilution that resulted in an absorbance value (OD-optical density)
just above calculated background: for mice experiments, 3-fold the OD of 1:100 serum dilution from naïve
mice; for monkey experiments, 4-fold the OD from secondary antibody alone. Serum from naïve BALB/c
animals are routinely tested at 1:100 dilution as negative control in ELISA, and the resulting OD is nearly
at the level of secondary Ab alone, therefore for mouse experiments baseline titers cannot be detected,
calculated and plotted.
RBD/ACE-2 neutralization ELISA
RBD/ACE-2 neutralization ELISA (ACROBiosystems) was performed according to manufacturer instruction.
In brief: MaxiSorp ELISA plates (Nunc) were coated with 50ng/well (100μl at 0.5 μg/ml) of SARS-CoV-2
RBD protein for 16h at 4°C, blocked for 1.5h at 37°C, incubated 1h at 37°C with 50μl of 0.12 μg/ml
biotinylated recombinant human ACE-2 protein alone or with serial dilutions of mice sera. ACE-2 binding
was detected with HRP-conjugated streptavidin and developed with TMB substrate. Absorbance was read
at 450nm using EnSight multiple plate reader (PerkinElmer). Data are expressed as neutralization curves
calculating the percentage of ACE2/RBD binding inhibition at the different serum dilutions relative to the
control without inhibitory antibodies.
SARS-CoV2 microneutralization assay
Human sera derived from post-convalescent COVID-19 patients after signing of an informed consent, in
the frame of a project aimed at following up patients.
Sera collected from patients and vaccinated animals were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes, and
titrated in duplicate in two-fold serial dilutions. Equal volumes of 100 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 (strain 2019nCoV/Italy-INMI) and serum dilutions, were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, 96well tissue culture plates with sub-confluent Vero E6 cell monolayers were infected with 100 μl/well of
virus-serum mixtures and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After 48 hours, microplates were observed at
the microscope for the presence of cytopathic effect (CPE). To standardize inter-assay procedures,
positive control samples showing high and low neutralizing activity were used for each
microneutralization assay. The supernatant of each plate was carefully discarded and 120 μl of a
Crystal Violet solution containing 2% Formaldehyde was added to each well. After 30 min fixation, the
fixing solution was removed and cell viability measured by photometer at 595 nm (Synergy HTX Biotek).
The serum dilution inhibiting 50% of the CPE (IC50) was calculated using graph pad prism 7 as described
in (24)

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus neutralization assay.
Pseudotyped viruses were produced as previously described (25). Briefly, 1.5 × 106 HEK293T cells were
seeded overnight in a 10 cm diameter Primaria-coated dish (Corning). Transfections were performed using
2 µg each of the murine leukemia virus (MLV) Gag-Pol packaging vector (phCMV-5349), luciferase
encoding reporter plasmid (pTG126) and plasmid encoding the same human-codon optimized version of
the SARS-CoV-2 spike coding sequence as detailed above, minus the HA tag. These were mixed with 24 µl
cationic polymer transfection reagent (polyethylenimine), in the presence of Optimem (Gibco), and the
media replaced with 10 ml complete DMEM after 6 h. A no-envelope control (empty pseudotype) was
used as a negative control in all experiments. Supernatants containing SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes were
harvested at 72 h post-transfection and filtered through 0.45-μm-pore-size membranes. For infectivity
and neutralization assays, either 1.5x104 HuH7 cells or 2×104 VeroE6 cells/well were plated in white 96well tissue culture plates (Corning) and incubated overnight at 37°C. The following day, SARS-CoV-2
pseudotypes were incubated with heat-inactivated sera for 1 hr at RT before being added to cells for 4 h.
Following this, sera and media were discarded, and 200 µl DMEM was added to the cells. After 72 h, media
was discarded, and cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer (Promega) and placed on a rocker for 15 min.
Luciferase activity was then measured in relative light units (RLUs) using a FLUOstar Omega plate reader
(BMG Labtech) with MARS software. Each sample was tested in triplicate.
ELISpot
For ELISpot assays, MSIP 96 well plates were from Millipore (Multiscreen filter plates) and anti-mouse or
anti-monkey IFNγ or IL4 capture and detection antibodies were all from U-CyTech. Lymphocytes (from
mouse spleens/lungs or macaque PBMC) were plated in duplicate at appropriate cell densities and
cultured for 18-20 hours at 37°C, 5% CO2 with peptide pools covering the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
referred to as S1 or S2 (JPT PepMix). Stimulation conditions were 1 (for mouse lymphocytes) or 3 μg/ml
(for monkey’s PBMCs) final single peptide concentration, or the equivalent amount of DMSO, the peptide
diluent, as negative control. Cytokine production and spot formation was detected with alkaline
phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin and NBT/BCIP alkaline phosphatase substrate. The number of spots
per well, directly related to the precursor frequency of antigen-specific T cells, was counted and analysed
with a CTL ImmunoSpot reader. Data are expressed as cytokine spot forming cells (SFC) per million
splenocytes, lung lymphocytes or PBMC, and are shown upon subtraction of DMSO background.
Intracellular cytokine staining and FACS analysis
Mouse splenocytes were used freshly isolated, while monkey PBMCs were stimulated after thawing and
overnight resting in culture medium. Cells were plated at 1x106 per well in a 96-well round bottom plate
and stimulated with either SARS-CoV-2 peptide pool S1 or S2, or with DMSO as negative control, all in
presence of anti-CD28 antibody, for 18h (mouse cells) or 5h (monkey cells) in the presence of Brefeldin-A
(Sigma). Cells were then washed to stop the stimulation, stained with Live/Dead fixable dye (Invitrogen),
fixed and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit following manufacturer instructions, and then
stained with specific fluorochrome conjugated antibodies. Sample acquisition was performed with LSR
Fortessa-X20 cytofluorimeter (BD biosciences) and sample analysis was performed with FlowJo (TreeStar).
Mouse Antibodies: CD3 AlexaFluor647, CD4 BV421, CD8 BUV395, IL-17a PerCP-Cy 5.5, IFNγ BV650, IL2
APC-R700 (from BD Biosciences), IL-4 PE, IL-13 PE (Invitrogen). NPH Antibodies: CD3 AF700, CD4 PerCP-Cy
5.5, CD8 PE (from BD Biosciences), IFNγ FITC (U-Cytech).

Statistics
GraphPad Prism version 8 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA) was used for
graphs and statistical analysis. In figure 6, since the data showed Gaussian distribution as per all normality
tests run, a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test was used. Only statistically significant results were
reported in the figures, *p ≤ 0,05; **p ≤ 0,01; ***p ≤ 0,001; ****p ≤ 0,0001. For the macaque study, the
numerosity of the groups was too small to allow statistical analysis.
