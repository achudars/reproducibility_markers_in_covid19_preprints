Abstract
COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease and was recently declared as a pandemic by WHO.
Currently, there is no vaccine or therapeutic available for this disease. Drug repositioning
represents the only feasible option to address this global challenge and a panel of 48 FDAapproved drugs that have been pre-selected by an assay of SARS-CoV was screened to identify
potential antiviral drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found a total of 24 drugs
which exhibited antiviral efficacy (0.1 µM < IC50 < 10 µM) against SARS-CoV-2. In particular,
two FDA-approved drugs - niclosamide and ciclesonide – were notable in some respects. These
drugs will be tested in an appropriate animal model for their antiviral activities. In near future,
these already FDA-approved drugs could be further developed following clinical trials in order
to provide additional therapeutic options for patients with COVID-19.

Introduction
COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 1.
Although the case fatality rate due to this viral infection varies from 1 to 12% 2, the transmission
rate is relatively high 3 and recently, the WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.
Currently, there is no vaccines or therapeutics available and the patients with COVID-19 are
being treated with supportive care.
Drug repositioning could be an effective strategy to respond immediately to emerging infectious
diseases since the new drug development usually takes more than 10 years 4. FDA-approved
drugs provide safe alternatives only in the case where at least modest antiviral activity can be
achieved. Accordingly, several drugs are being tested in numerous clinical trials 5 including
remdesivir, lopinavir, and chloroquine 6.
In this study, we screened a panel of FDA-approved drugs to identify antiviral drug candidates
for the treatment of COVID-19 and suggest the identified drug candidates may be considered for
therapeutic development.

Results and Discussion
We screened approximately 3,000 FDA- and IND-approved drug library against SARS-CoV to
identify antiviral drug candidates (manuscript in preparation). Since the SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 are very similar (79.5% sequence identity) 1, the drugs which show antiviral activity
against SARS-CoV are expected to show similar extent of antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.
A total of 35 drugs were selected from the earlier SARS-CoV screening results. In addition, 13
drugs were included based on recommendations from infectious diseases specialists (Table 1).
For screening experiments, Vero cells were used and each drug was added to the cells prior to
the virus infection. At 24 h after the infection, the infected cells were scored by
immunofluorescence analysis with an antibody specific for the viral N protein of SARS-CoV-2.
The confocal microscope images of both viral N protein and cell nuclei were analyzed using our
in-house Image Mining (IM) software and the dose-response curve (DRC) for each drug was
generated (Figure 1).

Chloroquine, lopinavir, and remdesivir were used as reference drugs with IC50 values of 9.12,
7.28, and 11.41 µM, respectively (Figure 1A). Among the 48 drugs that were evaluated in our
study, 24 drugs showed potential antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 values in
between 0.1 and 10 µM; Tilorone, Cyclosporine, Loperamide, Mefloquine, Amodiaquine,
Proscillaridin, Digitoxin, Digoxin, Hexachlorophene, Hydroxyprogesterone caproate,
Salinomycin, Ouabain, Cepharanthine, Ciclesonide, Oxyclozanide, Anidulafungin, Gilteritinib,
Berbamine, Tetrandrine, Abemaciclib, Ivacaftor, Bazedoxifene, Niclosamide, and Eltrombopag.
Among these 24 drugs, two FDA-approved drugs drew our attention. First, niclosamide, an
antihelminthic drug, exhibited very potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (IC50 = 0.28
µM). Not surprisingly, its broad-spectrum antiviral effect has been well documented in the
literature 7 including antiviral properties against SARS- and MERS-CoV 8,9. Recently, Gassen et
al. demonstrated that niclosamide inhibits SKP2 activity, which enhances autophagy and reduces
MERS-CoV replication 9. A similar mechanism might be attributable for the inhibition of SARSCoV-2 infection by niclosamide. Although niclosamide suffers a pharmacokinetic flaw of low
adsorption, further development or drug formulation could enable an effective delivery of this
drug to the target tissue 10.
Second, ciclesonide is another interesting drug candidate for further development although its
antiviral potency was much lower (IC50 = 4.33 µM) than niclosamide. It is an inhaled
corticosteroid used to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis 11. A recent report by Matsuyama et al.
corroborated our finding of ciclesonide as a potential antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2 12. A
treatment report of three patients who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Japan
(https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200303_20/) warrants further clinical investigation
of this drug in patients with COVID-19. Intriguingly, an underlying mechanism for the
suppression of viral infection by ciclesonide has been revealed by the isolation of a drug-resistant
mutant 12. The isolation of the drug-resistant mutant indicated that NSP15, a viral
riboendonuclease, is the molecular target of ciclesonide. Together, it is not unreasonable to
consider that ciclesonide exhibits a direct-acting antiviral activity in addition to its intrinsic antiinflammatory function. In the future, siRNA targeting the hormone receptor will allow to assess
the extent of direct-acting antiviral activity. With its proven anti-inflammatory activity,

ciclesonide may represent as a potent drug which can manifest dual roles (antiviral and antiinflammatory) for the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Prior to our evaluation of 48 drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection, we also tested antiviral
activity of several other drugs based on the cytopathic effect of the virus in the presence of each
drug (Figure 2). In particular, the effect of favipiravir and atazanavir was compared to those of
the reference drugs (chloroquine, lopinavir, remdesivir) because favipiravir is considered as a
drug candidate for clinical trials and atazanavir was recently predicted as the most potent
antiviral drug by AI-inference modeling 13. However, in the current work, we did not observe
any antiviral activity of either favipiravir or atazanavir.
In summary, we selected and screened 48 FDA-approved drugs based on our SARS-CoV
screening and our screening campaign revealed 24 potential antiviral drug candidates against
SARS-CoV-2. Our findings could be further validated in an appropriate animal model, and
hopefully developed through subsequent clinical trials in order to provide additional therapeutic
options for patients with COVID-19.

Materials and Methods
Virus and Cells
Vero cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CCL-81) and
maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Welgene),
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1X AntibioticAntimycotic solution (Gibco). SARS-CoV-2 (βCoV/KOR/KCDC03/2020) was provided by
Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), and was propagated in Vero cells.
Viral titers were determined by plaque assays in Vero cells. All experiments using SARS-CoV-2
were performed at Institut Pasteur Korea in compliance with the guidelines of the KNIH, using
enhanced Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) containment procedures in laboratories approved for use by
the KCDC.

Chloroquine diphosphate (CQ; C6628) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO),
lopinavir (LPV; S1380) was purchased from SelleckChem (Houston, TX), and remdesivir (HY104077) was purchased from MedChemExpress (Monmouth Junction, NJ). Chloroquine was
dissolved in Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS; Welgene), and all other reagents
were dissolved in DMSO for the screening. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 N protein antibody was
purchased from Sino Biological Inc. (Beijing, China). Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H +
L) secondary antibody and Hoechst 33342 were purchased from Molecular Probes.
Paraformaldehyde (PFA) (32% aqueous solution) and normal goat serum were purchased from
Electron Microscopy Sciences (Hatfield, PA) and Vector Laboratories, Inc. (Burlingame, CA),
respectively.
Dose-response curve (DRC) analysis by immunofluorescence
Ten-point DRCs were generated for each drug. Vero cells were seeded at 1.2 × 104 cells per well
in DMEM, supplemented with 2% FBS and 1X Antibiotic-Antimycotic solution (Gibco) in black,
384-well, μClear plates (Greiner Bio-One), 24 h prior to the experiment. Ten-point DRCs were
generated, with compound concentrations ranging from 0.05–50 μM. For viral infection, plates
were transferred into the BSL-3 containment facility and SARS-CoV-2 was added at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.0125. The cells were fixed at 24 hpi with 4% PFA and
analyzed by immunofluorescence. The acquired images were analyzed using in-house software
to quantify cell numbers and infection ratios, and antiviral activity was normalized to positive
(mock) and negative (0.5% DMSO) controls in each assay plate. DRCs were fitted by sigmoidal
dose-response models, with the following equation: Y = Bottom + (Top  Bottom)/(1 +
(IC50/X)Hillslope), using XLfit 4 Software or Prism7. IC50 values were calculated from the
normalized activity dataset-fitted curves. All IC50 and CC50 values were measured in duplicate,
and the quality of each assay was controlled by Z'-factor and the coefficient of variation in
percent (%CV).
Dose-response curve (DRC) analysis by cytopathic effect (CPE)
Ten-point DRCs were generated for each drug. Vero cells were seeded at 1.2 × 104 cells per well
in DMEM, supplemented with 2% FBS and 1X Antibiotic-Antimycotic solution (Gibco) in white,
384-well, μClear plates (Greiner Bio-One), 24 h prior to the experiment. Ten-point DRCs were
generated, with compound concentrations ranging from 0.05–50 μM. For viral infection, plates

were transferred into the BSL-3 containment facility and SARS-CoV-2 was added at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05 and incubated at 37 ºC for 72 h. Cell viability was
measured using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Antiviral activity was determined by the degree of inhibition of viral
cytopathic effect. The results were normalized to positive (mock) and negative (0.5% DMSO)
controls in each assay plate. DRCs were fitted by sigmoidal dose-response models, with the
following equation: Y = Bottom + (Top  Bottom)/(1 + (IC50/X)Hillslope), using XLfit 4 Software
or Prism7. IC50 values were calculated from the normalized activity dataset-fitted curves. All
IC50 and CC50 values were measured in duplicate, and the quality of each assay was controlled
by Z’-factor and the coefficient of variation in percent (%CV).
