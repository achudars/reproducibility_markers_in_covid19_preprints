Summary. ​The lack of an identifiable intermediate host species for the proximal animal
ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and the distance (~1500 km) from Wuhan to Yunnan province,
where the closest evolutionary related coronaviruses circulating in horseshoe bats have
been identified, is fueling speculation on the natural origins of SARS-CoV-2. Here we
analyse SARS-CoV-2’s related bat and pangolin ​Sarbecoviruses and confirm horseshoe
​ re the likely true reservoir species as their host ranges extend across
bats, ​Rhinolophus, a
Central and Southern China, and into Southeast Asia. This would explain the bat
Sarbecovirus recombinants in the West and East China, trafficked pangolin infections and
bat Sarbecovirus recombinants linked to Southern China, and the recently reported bat
in Cambodia and Thailand. Some horseshoe bat species, such as ​R. affinis
Sarbecovirses ​
seem to play a more significant role in virus spread as they have larger ranges. Recent
ecological disturbances as a result of changes in meat sources could explain SARS-CoV-2
transmission to humans through direct or indirect contact with infected wildlife, and
subsequent emergence towards Hubei in Central China. The only way, however, of finding
the animal progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the whereabouts of its close relatives, very
likely capable of posing a similar threat of emergence in the human population and other
animals, will be by (carefully) increasing the intensity of our sampling.

One year since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the origins of this new pandemic human
coronavirus remains an apparent mystery. First detected in association with an unusual
respiratory disease outbreak in December 2019 at a wet market in Wuhan city, Hubei
province, China ​(Li et al. 2020) no definitive animal progenitor has been identified.
Environmental samples taken from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in question have
only revealed evidence for human infections and the finding of cases with no linkage to this
location suggests it may not be ‘ground zero’ for the SARS-CoV-2 spillover event. This
coupled with the distance (~1500 km) from Wuhan to Yunnan province where the closest
evolutionary related coronaviruses circulating in horseshoe bats have been identified ​(Zhou
et al. 2020)​, has fed, without evidence, a conspiracy theory about the origins of SARS-CoV-2
being the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
Without question SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the ​Sarbecovirus subgenus of
) and a sister lineage
Betacoronaviruses ​found in horseshoe bat hosts (family ​Rhinophilidae​
of SARS-CoV (Figure 1A), the causative agent of the SARS outbreak in 2002-3 ​(Gorbalenya
et al. 2020)​. Here, we focus on the broader set of ‘nCoV’ ​Sarbecoviruses that cluster with
SARS-CoV-2 in phylogenetic analysis and perform recombination detection analysis on a
whole genome alignment of all the available ​Sarbecoviruses (Figure 1A). This identified 16
recombination breakpoints that can be used to split the alignment into 17 putatively
non-recombinant genomic regions from which evolutionary history can be inferred. To clearly
characterise the recombination patterns between viruses in the same clade as SARS-CoV-2

and those in the sister clade, which includes SARS-CoV, we have attributed each virus in
each of the 17 regions to either being in the nCoV clade or the non-nCoV clade (closer to
SARS-CoV), similarly defined in MacLean et al. ​(2020)​.

While the two genetically closest relatives to SARS-CoV-2 identified so far are the bat
Sarbecovirus​es RaTG13 and RmYN02 ​(Zhou et al. 2020​; 2020b)​, both recombinants from
samples collected in Yunnan (Figure 1B), they are estimated to have shared a common
ancestor with SARS-CoV-2 about 40/50 years ago ​(Boni et al. 2020​; ​Wang et al. 2020​;
MacLean et al. 2020) so are too distant to be SARS-CoV-2’s progenitors. Importantly, three
recombinant bat ​Sarbecovirus​es, CoVZC45, CoVZXC21 and Longquan_140, the next
closest SARS-CoV-2 relatives in the nCoV clade (for most of their genomes for CoVZC45
and CoVZXC21, except for four regions on Orf1ab and Spike, and for two parts of
Longquan_140’s genome) were all sampled in Zhejiang a coastal province in Eastern China
(Hu et al. 2018​; ​Lin et al. 2017) (Figure 1 and S3). Interestingly, in the second nCoV part of
Longquan_140’s genome, the HKU3 set of closely related bat ​Sarbecoviruses sampled in
Hong Kong (bordering Guangdong province) also cluster within the nCoV clade.
Longquan_140 and HKU3 also share a recent common ancestor for most parts of their
genomes, suggesting that this recombinant region was acquired in their shared ancestor.
, the bringing together of
This high prevalence of recombination among ​Sarbecoviruses​
evolutionary divergent genome regions in co-infected hosts to form a hybrid virus, is typical
of many RNA viruses and for coronaviruses provides a balance to their relatively slow
evolutionary rate ​(Graham and Baric 2010)​. ​Recombinants with parts of their genomes
shared with the SARS-CoV-2 progenitor (between 40 and 100 years ago, Figure 1A) are
distributed on both sides of China (a distance of ~2000 km) indicating the urgent need to
broaden the geographical region being searched for the SARS-CoV-2's immediate animal
ancestor and avoiding being overly focussed on the Yunnan location of the two closest
Sarbecoviruses ​
RaTG13 and RmYN02.
The finding that Sunda (also known as Malayan) pangolins, ​Manis javanica, non-native to
China, are the other mammal species from which ​Sarbecoviruses related to SARS-CoV-2
have been sampled in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces in the southern part of China
(Lam et al. 2020​; ​Xiao et al. 2020)​, indicates these animals are being infected in this part of
the country (Figure 1B). Pangolins are one of the most frequently trafficked animals with
multiple smuggling routes leading to Southern China ​(Xu et al. 2016)​. The most common
routes involve moving the animals from Southeast Asia (Myanmar, Malaysia, Laos,
Indonesia, Vietnam) to Guangxi, Guangdong, and Yunnan. The most likely scenario is that
these Sarbecoviruses infected the pangolins after being trafficked into Southern China,
consistent with the respiratory distress they exhibit ​(Liu et al. 2019​; ​Xiao et al. 2020) and the
lack of evidence of infection of Sunda pangolins in Malaysia ​(Lee et al. 2020)​.
Pangolin's susceptibility to an apparently new human coronavirus is not surprising given the
well-documented generalist nature of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., ​Conceicao et al. 2020)​, which has
been found to readily transmit to multiple mammals with similar ACE2 receptors and poses a
grave risk of reverse-zoonosis as has been seen most notably with human to mink
transmissions ​(Oude Munnink et al. 2021)​. Twelve months since SARS-CoV-2’s first
characterisation, the lack of finding of an intermediate reservoir species indicates that the
important evolution that gave rise to this coronavirus, with this highly infectious nature in
multiple animal species including humans, occurred in horseshoe bats ​(MacLean et al.
2020​)​. Although, the recent confirmation of a ​Sarbecovirus ​sampled from a Chinese
pangolin, ​Manis pentadactyla,​ in Yunnan, sampled in 2017 (​GISAID ID EPI_ISL_610156,
authors: Jian-Bo Li, Hang Liu, Ting-Ting Yin, Min-Sheng Peng and Ya-Ping Zhang of the
State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology,
Chinese Academy of Sciences​), does raise the question, are Chinese pangolins infected
endemically? However, this may also have been an imported animal. ​The key, and urgent

question to prevent another emergence, is thus ​not​, how did SARS-CoV-2 get from Yunnan
to Hubei, but rather which bat or other animal species are harbouring nCoV ​Sarbecoviruses
and what is the risk of a future spillover?
It seems clear that horseshoe bat ranges that link the different regions sarbecoviruses are
observed in, should get priority focus for sampling. For example, the Intermediate horseshoe
bat species ​R. affinis is sufficiently dispersed across China to account for the geographical
spread of i) bat Sarbecovirus recombinants in the West and East of China, ii) infected
imported pangolins in the South, iii) bat Sarbecovirus recombinant links to Southern China,
and iv) SARS-CoV-2 emergence towards Hubei in Central China (Figure 1B). ​Strikingly, the
ranges of these species are overlapping, especially for ​R. affinis ​and ​R. sinicus across the
regions of China where all the nCoV-associated viruses have been collected (Figure 1C).
The other possible horseshoe bat hosts, ​R. ferrumequinum, is not found in large parts of
Central or Southern China, while ​R. malayanus ​is found in the West part of China only. ​R.
malayanus’s association appears to be due to parts of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage being
exchanged into this species that is found predominantly in countries on the Southwest of
China (​Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Viet Nam, and Peninsular Malaysia​; ​Bates et
al. 2018)​ and only in Yunnan where RmYN02 was sampled ​(Zhou et al. 2020b)​.
The evidence for ​R. affinis being the prime suspect for SARS-CoV-2’s original host in China
is supported by its finding in shared roosts with ​R. sinicus and ​R. ferrumequinum in Yunnan
and ​R. sinicus ​in Guangxi ​(Luo et al. 2013)​, providing opportunities for host switches,
co-infections and thus recombination between the sarbecoviruses that they carry. Latinne et
al. ​(2020) recently published a large-scale sampling expedition of coronaviruses across bats
in China. Although only short RdRp fragments were sequenced, reconstructing the
phylogeny for the novel viruses reveals a cluster of seven identical sarbecoviruses within the
nCoV clade, close to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S1), with the identifiable ​Rhinolophus species
being ​R. affinis.​
Based on the analysis of the sarbecovirus and host data presented here, we propose that
horseshoe bat population sampling should focus on the known ranges of probable bat hosts
and sample (carefully, both to avoid a further spillover ​or reverse zoonosis) in likely
subterranean environments spread across China ​(Luo et al. 2013)​. Sampling strategies will
also need to consider the distinct subspecies of ​Rhinolophus ​as the delineators of
genetically meaningful host populations for coronaviruses, for example, there are two on
mainland China for ​R. affinis​: ​himalayanus ​and ​macrurus ​(Mao et al. 2010)​. While ​R. affinis
seems to be a likely significant reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2’s proximal ancestor in China,
we urge caution due to the broad dispersion of coronaviruses ​in bat species ​(Fan et al.
2019)​. For example, the Least horseshoe bat species ​R. pusillus is broadly distributed
across China (and into Southeast Asia) with limited full viral genomes identified from this
species, despite metagenomic analysis finding a high diversity of viruses including
coronaviruses ​(Hu et al. 2017)​. Future sampling should also not be restricted to just bat
species and needs to encompass a range of indigenous mammals that we now know can be
infected by coronaviruses. It is also possible that Chinese pangolins, given their
susceptibility to infection and host range across Southern China ​(Challender et al. 2019)​, are
the ‘missing’ intermediate host of the SARS-CoV-2 proximal ancestor.
The recent reporting of bat sarbecoviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 from (i) two
samples collected in Cambodia from ​R. shameli confirmed by whole-genome analysis ​(Hul
et al. 2021)​, and (ii) five bat samples from ​R. acuminatus ​collected in Thailand
(Wacharapluesadee et al. 2021), necessitates further extending the search for the
SARS-COV-2 progenitor into Southeast Asia. Intriguingly the host range of ​R. affinis

stretches not only across China but all the way into Southeast Asia including Thailand and
Cambodia. This highlights an important feature of bat species, their frequently
overlapping/sympatric ranges, giving ample opportunity for movement of viral variants from
one species (or sub-species) to another.
One unique SARS-CoV-2 signature that has raised considerable interest due to its functional
importance in virus cell entry is the furin cleavage site (FCS) on its Spike protein ​(Hoffmann
et al. 2020)​. The 12 nucleotide insertion producing this FCS is absent at that site from all of
the other 68 ​Sarbecoviruses sampled, raising concerns about potential ‘non-natural’
laboratory origins. However, similar protease cleavage sites at this part of Spike have been
reported in a number of coronaviruses, indicative of a significant role in S1/S2 and S2’
protease-mediated cleavage of Spike ​(Garry and Gallaher, 2020)​. The finding of related
cleavage sites supports the natural origin of the insertion. Gallaher ​(Gallaher, 2020) has
provided one explanation for how the FCS arose through ​a copy-choice recombination error
between the proximal ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and a yet unsampled Betacoronavirus. This
event would suggest circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 progenitor with another unsampled
virus, at times infecting the same individual. Specifically, a short region of sequence of
homology between SARS-CoV-2 and RmYN02 (Figure S2 and see ​Zhou et al. 2020​b and
Lytras et al. 20​20), and confirmed ​to be present in the bat sarbecovirus RacCS203 sampled
in Thailand (Wacharapluesadee et al. 2021​)​, ​supports the copy-choice origin of the FCS in a
co-infected bat. As mentioned above RmYN02 is a recombinant virus with most of its Spike
gene belonging to the non-nCoV clade (recombinant regions 10 and 11, Figure 1A). Since
this recombination pattern is absent from the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the event responsible
took place after the two virus lineages diverged, less than about 40 years ago so relatively
recently.
Another region of the Spike protein critical for emergence in humans is the receptor binding
domain. The ability of the nCoV ​Sarbecovirses to use human ACE2 is confusing due to the
recombination nature of Spike in these viruses. Specifically, RaTG13 has a divergent RBM
region ​(Boni et al. 2020)​, while RmYN02 is non-nCoV like in this region. However, that the
pangolin sarbecoviruses can use hACE2 efficientl​y ​(Thomson et al. 2021)​, ​a probable recent
nCoV acquisition from bats, demonstrates members of the nCoV clade of viruses can infect
humans if given the opportunity. This capability of bat ​Sarbecoviruses to infect human cells
was well documented prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 (​Ge et al. 2013;
Menachery et al. 2015)​.
Although, beyond relatively rare detection of SARS-like antibodies in rural communities in
China ​(Li et al. 2019​; ​Wang et al. 2018)​, that SARS-CoV variants have not, to our
knowledge, seeded outbreaks in humans before, would indicate there are limited human
exposure to these viruses suggesting ecological barriers to emergence ​(Plowright et al.
2017)​. One possible recent disruption that would have caused widespread and unusual
movement of animals in China, breaking this ‘barrier’, was the dramatic shortage of pork
products in 2019 ​(Mason-D’Croz et al. 2020) as a result of African swine fever virus (ASFV)
infecting 100s of millions of pigs in China (30-50% of the population) and the very sharp rise
in the price of pork. The culling of large numbers of pigs, together with regional control
measures of hog/pork movement, led to increased animal transportation in China. As pork is
the major food source in China, such movements on a large scale will have potentially
brought humans into increased contact with ​Sarbecovirus i​nfected animals as i) exotic meats
replaced pork, ii) animals from rural locations were brought to city markets and/or iii) by
infected meat being transported in cold chain processes. Given the reality of frequent

human-animal contact, routine characterisation of respiratory infections would seem a
sensible precaution to prevent future emergence of ​Sarbecoviruses​.
Conclusion. ​The currently available data, although sparse, illustrates a complex history
behind the natural evolution of SARS-CoV-2, governed by co-circulation of related
coronaviruses, over at least the last 100 years, across the bat populations from
East-to-West/Central and Southern China, and into Southeast Asia with multiple
recombination events imprinted on the genomes of these viruses. The evidence of
recombination events between viruses sampled in different geographical regions and from
different bat hosts, indicates frequent movement of the viruses between different regions and
species (and presumably sub-species too) as a result of the different bat populations that
carry them coming into frequent contact. Although the presence of occasional intermediate
hosts, even between bats and humans in the case of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be discounted,
the long geographic ranges covered by the recombination patterns would require a reservoir
host with a wide geographical range. All the evidence points to this host being Chinese
horseshoe bats. Having presented evidence in support for ​R. affinis’​s importance, it should
be noted at least 20 different ​Rhinolophus s​pecies are distributed across China (four being
endemic to China) leaving many species for which the viruses are unknown. Also, the
generalist nature of sarbecoviruses means wild or farmed animals (e.g., minks) could
facilitate transmission of viruses from bats to humans. The risk of future emergence of a new
SARS-CoV-2 nCoV strain is too high to restrict sampling strategies.
Methods
The whole genome sequences of the 69 ​Sarbecoviruses used in this analysis (Table S1)
were aligned and the open reading frames (ORF) of the major protein-coding genes were
defined based on SARS-CoV-2 annotation. To minimise alignment error codon-level
alignments of the ORFs were created using MAFFT ​(Katoh et al. 2005) and PAL2NAL
(Suyama et al. 2006)​. The intergenic regions were also aligned separately using MAFFT and
all alignments were pieced together into the final whole-genome alignment and visually
inspected in Bioedit ​(Hall and Others 1999)​.
The resulting alignment was examined for recombination breakpoints using the Genetic
Algorithm for Recombination Detection (GARD) method ​(Pond et al. 2006) and likelihood
was evaluated using the Akaike Inference Criterion (AIC). This analysis provided 16 likely
breakpoints (positions corresponding to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome Wuhan-Hu-1 in
order: 926, 3327, 5115, 8886, 11676, 14306, 18473, 20082, 21470, 22566, 23311, 24279,
25449, 26054, 27845 and 28257) based on which the whole-genome alignment was split
into 17 putatively non-recombinant regions. Phylogenetic reconstruction of each region was
performed using RAxML-NG ​(Kozlov et al. 2019) under a GTR+Γ model. Node support was
determined using the Transfer Bootstrap Expectation (TBE) ​(Lemoine et al. 2018) with 1000
replicates for each tree. All constructed phylogenies are presented in Figure S3.
Almost all phylogenies have the same overall topology with the BtKY72 and BM48-31
viruses lineage being the outgroup and two sister lineages separating in the ingroup clade,
one containing SARS-CoV-2 and the other SARS-CoV along with their related viruses. The
nCoV clade was defined as the monophyletic grouping of SARS-CoV-2 with the non-nCoV
clade as its ingroup sister lineage (similar to the clade definition used in MacLean et al.
(2020)​. The phylogenies of three non-recombinant regions - 10, 12 and 13 - had topologies
incongruent to that of all the other genomic regions. In particular, in these special cases the
clade containing SARS-CoV-2 clusters within parts of the non-nCoV clade (Figure S3). The
three regions are parts of the Spike ORF, indicating that the tree incongruencies are either a

result of selection signatures that disrupt the phylogenetic reconstruction, or deeper
signatures of Spike recombination not detected by GARD. The nCoV clade was visually
determined for these regions based on its definition in the other non-recombinant regions’
trees. A final special case is non-recombinant region 16 for which four viruses - JTL2012,
JTMC15, BtKY72, BM48-31 - are missing more than 90% of their sequence. These viruses
were excluded from that alignment before reconstructing the phylogeny to avoid artefactual
signals due to limited genetic information. Phylogenies were visualised using FigTree
(​http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/​) and ETE 3 ​(Huerta-Cepas et al. 2016)​.
To illustrate the distance of each virus from SARS-CoV-2, while distinguishing whether the
virus in question is part of the nCoV clade or the non-nCoV clade, we use an arbitrary tip
distance scale normalised between all phylogenies so distances are comparable between
regions. For each maximum likelihood tree, the tip distance between each tip and
SARS-CoV-2 is calculated using ETE 3 as d1 for members of the nCoV clade and d2 for
members of the non-nCoV clade. The distances are then normalised so that for nCoV clade
members they range between 0.1 and 1.1 (1.1 being SARS-CoV-2 itself and 0.1 being the
most distant tip from SARS-CoV-2 within the nCoV clade) and between -0.1 and -1.1 for
non-nCoV members (-0.1 being the closest non-nCoV virus to SARS-CoV-2 and -1.1 the
most distant), as follows:

d′1 = 1.1 −

d1

(1:nCoV)

d1,max
d2 − d2,min

d′2 = − 0.1 −

d2,max − d2,min

(2:non-nCoV)

With d’1 and d’2 being the normalised values for each clade, variables denoted with ‘min’
being the smallest distance and variables denoted with ‘max’ being the largest distance in
each given set.
To provide temporal information to the phylogenetic history of the viruses, we performed a
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis on non-recombination region 4, using BEAST ​(Bouckaert et
al. 2019)​. This region was selected due to its length, being the second longest
non-recombinant region in the analysis (3764 bp), and because it represents one of the
non-recombinant regions where the CoVZC45/CoVZXC21 lineage clusters within the nCoV
clade. Based on the observation of an increased evolutionary rate specific to the deepest
branch of the nCoV clade reported in MacLean et al. (2020), we adopted the same approach
of fitting a separate local clock model to that branch from the rest of the phylogeny. A normal
rate distribution with mean 5x10​-4 and standard deviation 2x10​-4 was used as an informative
prior on all other branches. The lineage containing the BtKY72 and BM48-31 bat viruses was
constrained as the outgroup to maintain overall topology. Codon positions were partitioned
and a GTR+Γ substitution model was specified independently for each partition. The
maximum likelihood phylogeny reconstructed previously for non-recombinant region 4 was
used as a starting tree. A constant size coalescent model was used for the tree prior and a
lognormal prior with a mean of 6 and standard deviation of 0.5 was specified on the
population size. Two independent MCMC runs were performed for 250 million states for the
dataset.
Geographical and genomic visualisation was performed using D3 and JavaScript in
Observable.
