Abstract
SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, evades the human immune system by
capping its RNA. This process protects the viral RNA and is essential for its replication. Multiple
viral proteins are involved in this RNA capping process including the nonstructural protein 16
(nsp16) which is an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent 2'-O-methyltransferase. Nsp16 is
significantly active when in complex with another nonstructural protein, nsp10, which plays a key
role in its stability and activity. Here we report the development of a fluorescence polarization
(FP)-based RNA displacement assay for nsp10-nsp16 complex in 384-well format with a Z′-Factor
of 0.6, suitable for high throughput screening. In this process, we purified the nsp10-nsp16
complex to higher than 95% purity and confirmed its binding to the methyl donor SAM, product
of the reaction, SAH, and a common methyltransferase inhibitor, sinefungin using Isothermal
Titration Calorimetry (ITC). The assay was further validated by screening a library of 1124 druglike compounds. This assay provides a cost-effective high throughput method for screening nsp10nsp16 complex for RNA-competitive inhibitors towards developing COVID-19 therapeutics.

Introduction
Over the last two decades, major outbreaks of coronaviruses have been endured worldwide. These
include zoonotic epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) in
2002,1 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) in 2012,2, 3 and the current
pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 that started in 2019 (COVID-19).4 With more than 34 million
confirmed COVID-19 infections and a million deaths so far (October 3rd 2020; World Health
Organization; https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019), the COVID19 pandemic had widespread global socioeconomic implications, and overwhelmed health systems
world-wide.
Coronavirus (CoV) is a member of the subfamily Coronavirinae within the family Coronaviridae.5,
6

Many species can be infected by CoVs.6 However, only seven coronaviruses have been

documented to infect humans to date.4, 7 These include SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV2 which could cause severe symptoms leading to higher fatalities.4 Infection of 229E, HKU1,
OC43, and NL63 has been associated with a range of relatively mild respiratory diseases.7 SARSCoV-2 shares 79.6% RNA sequence identity with SARS‐CoV.8 Coronaviruses are enveloped, non2

segmented positive-sense RNA viruses which have the largest genome among RNA viruses

9, 10

.

Their genomes contain six major open reading frames (ORFs) and various number of accessory
genes. They encode 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) that play essential roles in RNA replication
and processing of sub genomic RNA.11-14
SARS-CoV-2 replication involves RNA synthesis, proofreading and capping.15 Coronavirus
mRNAs are protected at their 5′ ends by a cap structure consisting of an N7-methylated guanine
linked to the first transcribed nucleotide by a 5′–5′ triphosphate bond and 2'-O-methylation (N7meGpppN-2′-O-me; Fig. 1).16 The RNA capping is essential for stability of viral mRNA and
evading the host immune system. Uncapped RNA molecules are identified as ‘foreign’ by host
innate immune response and undergo degradation.17,

18

Therefore, proteins catalyzing RNA-

capping are attractive targets for antiviral drug development. Nsps involved in viral mRNA
capping include nsp10 (cofactor for nsp14 and nsp16),19 nsp13 (RNA 5’-triphosphatase, helicase),
20

nsp14 (guanine‐N7 methyltransferase),21 and nsp16 (2’-O-methyltransferase).18, 22, 23

The capping process begins with the removal of the 5’γ-phosphate of the newly synthesized RNA
chains (pppN-RNA) by nsp13.20 Then a guanylyltransferase (GTase) leads to the formation of
GpppN-RNA, by transferring a Guanosine monophosphate (GMP) molecule to the 5’-diphosphate
of the RNA chains (ppN-RNA). Nsp14 methylates the cap structure at the N7 position of the
guanosine, resulting in the formation of cap-0 (N7-meGpppN-RNA).21 Ultimately, the nsp10nsp16 complex catalyzes the addition of a methyl group on the ribose 2′-O position of the first
transcribed nucleotide of the cap-0 (N7-meGpppN-RNA) to form a cap-1 (N7-meGpppNmeRNA) (Fig. 1).23,

24

In vitro, methyltransferase activity has been reported for nsp10-nsp16

complexes from feline CoV (FCoV),25 SARS-CoV,23 and MERS-CoV,26 and the binding of
various RNAs to MERS-CoV have been assessed and used to rank-order substrates.26
Nsp10 acts as an allosteric activator of nsp16 and is essential for its stability and activity,18, 27
increasing its binding affinity for RNA substrate and SAM in both SARS and MERS-CoV.18
Various structures of nsp10-nsp16 from SARS-COV-2 have been recently deposited in Protein
Data Bank (PDB) such as PDB IDs: 6W4H, 6W75, 6WJT, 6WKQ, 6WVN, 6WQ3 and 6WRZ.28
These include the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 in complex with SAM (6W75), SAH (6WJT),
sinefungin (6WKQ) and in complex with both RNA (N7-meGpppA) and SAM (6WVN) or RNA

(N7-meGpppA) and SAH (6WQ3 and 6WRZ).28 Along with previously available structures from
SARS-CoV nsp10-nsp16 (PDB IDs: 2XYR, 2XYV, 2XYQ, 3R24)18, 22 and MERS-CoV nsp16
(PDB ID: 5YN5), these structures provide vast amount of information on interaction of substrates
with nsp16 and could be used in structure guided drug discovery (Fig. 2).
Here we report the development of a cost-effective fluorescence polarization-based RNAdisplacement assay which is suitable for high-throughput screening of nsp10-nsp16 complex
against large libraries of compounds to identify RNA competitive inhibitors of nsp16
methyltransferase activity. This assay is also a perfect tool for triaging a high number of potential
inhibitors from screening by alternative methods for competing with RNA substrate and
determining their mechanism of inhibition.

All fluorescence polarization (FP) experiments were performed in a total assay volume of 20 µL
per well in 384-well black polypropylene PCR plates (Axygen, Tewksbury, MA, USA; cat. PCR384-BK) using FAM (Fluorescein amidites) labelled RNA (5' N7-meGpppACCCCC-FAM 3′) and
nsp10-nsp16 complex. In all experiments, nsp10-nsp16 complex was used at a ratio of 8 (nsp10):1
(nsp16). Fluorescence polarization (FP) was measured after 30 min of incubation at room
temperature, using a BioTek Synergy 4 (BioTek, Winooski, VT) with the excitation and emission
wavelengths of 485 nm and 528 nm, respectively. All experiments were performed in triplicate
(n=3) and plotted values are the average of 3 replicates ± standard deviation. The FP values were
blank subtracted and were presented as the percentage of control (FP %). Data were visualized
using GraphPad Prism software 7.04 (La Jolla, CA).

For Kd determination, varying concentrations of nsp10-nsp16 were incubated with 30 nM FAMRNA (5' N7-meGpppACCCCC-FAM 3′), in 10 mM Tris buffer pH 7.5 containing 5 mM DTT,
0.01% Triton X-100, 0.01% BSA for 30 min at room temperature in 20 µL reaction volume.
Fluorescence polarization (485 nm/ 528 nm) was measured using a Biotek Synergy H1. Change in
fluorescence polarization (mP) was plotted as a function of nsp10-nsp16 concentration. The
binding Kd and maximal FP signal (Bmax) were calculated using nonlinear least squares regression
to a single-site binding model in GraphPad Prism 7.04.

To establish the specificity of the assay, a mixture containing 0.5 µM nsp10-nsp16 complex and
30 nM FAM-RNA, in 10 mM Tris buffer pH 7.5 containing 5 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100,
0.01% BSA were incubated separately with varying concentrations of unlabelled RNA cap
analogues; N7-meGpppG, N7-meGpppA, GpppG and GpppA in 20 µL reaction volume
respectively for 30 min at room temperature. The FP values were determined, and the Kdisp (K
displacement) values (the concentrations required for 50% displacement of the labeled RNA) were
calculated using nonlinear least squares regression analysis to a four-parameter concentrationresponse curve model in GraphPad Prism 7.04.
Z′ factor determination
The Z′-factor was determined by incubating nsp10-nsp16 complex (0.5 µM) with 30 nM FAMRNA in the presence or absence of 50 µM unlabeled RNA (N7-meGpppA) in a 384-well plate for

30 min at room temperature (168 wells each). Fluorescence polarization was measured as
described above.

Screening compounds from the Prestwick library
Prestwick Chemical Library was purchased from Prestwick Chemicals and was screened using
optimized assay conditions (10 mM Tris buffer pH 7.5 containing 5 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X100, 0.01% BSA) at 50 µM compound concentration, with 0.5% DMSO concentration in 384-well
black polypropylene PCR plates (Axygen, Tewksbury, MA, USA; cat. PCR-384-BK) with a final
reaction volume of 20 µL for 30 min at room temperature. Data were analyzed using GraphPad
Prism 7.04 as described above.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)
Binding of SAM, SAH, and sinefungin to nsp10-nsp16 (8:1) complex was tested by Nano ITC
titration calorimeter (TA Instruments — Waters LLC, New Castle, DE) at 25 °C. Nsp10-nsp16
complex was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 200 mM NaCl and was
loaded into the sample cell (300 µL) at a concentration of 48 µM, and a solution of 500 µM of
ligand (SAM, SAH, or sinefungin) was placed in the injection syringe (50 µL). Data were fitted
with a one binding site model using TA Instruments origin software.

Results
SARS-COV-2 nsp10-nsp16 complex preparation and quality control
His-tagged nsp10 (residues A1- Q139) and nsp16 (S1 – N298) were expressed in E. coli separately
and purified to homogeneity using Ni-NTA resin as described in the supplementary material and
methods (Supplementary Fig.1). Purified nsp10 and nsp16 proteins were mixed at a molar ratio
of 8 to 1, respectively, to prepare stable and functional complex. The complex formation was
evaluated by running a sample of expected complex through size exclusion chromatography which
confirmed complex formation (Supplementary Fig. 2). In addition, the presence of intact nsp10
and nsp16 in the complex fractions were verified by mass spectrometry (Supplementary Fig. 3).

To evaluate the functional integrity of the prepared complex, we tested the binding of the methyl
donor SAM, product of the reaction SAH, and a common methyltransferase inhibitor sinefungin

using ITC. Nsp10-nsp16 complex showed binding to SAM, SAH and sinefungin with Kd values
of 3.4 ± 1.5 µΜ, 5.7 ± 1.9 µΜ, and 6.8 ± 2.0 µΜ, respectively, indicating the protein complex was
formed and maintained the expected active site conformation (Fig. 3).

RNA-displacement assay development
We used a FAM-labelled RNA (5' N7-meGpppACCCCC-FAM 3′) to set up an RNA displacement
assay. We first tested binding of this RNA to the nsp10-nsp16 complex. We observed significant
fluorescence polarization (FP) signal and proceeded to optimize the assay conditions
(Supplementary

Fig.

4).

Various

conditions

such

as

4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-

piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), Bis-Tris Propane (BTP), Sodium phosphate (NaP),
Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) and Potassium phosphate (KP) at 20 mM, pH 7.5 were
tested and the FP signal was relatively higher in Tris and HEPES than other buffers
(Supplementary Fig. 4A).
We selected to use 10 mM Tris for testing additives, which provided the highest signal
(Supplementary Fig. 4B). The signal was unaffected up to 1% BSA, 10 mM of TCEP, KCl and
MgCl2 (Supplementary Fig. 4C to 4F). The pH profile showed pH 7.5 as optimum (Fig. 4A). The
signal was not significantly affected by increasing concentrations of DTT (Fig. 4B), and NaCl
(Fig. 4C), or EDTA (Fig. 4D) up to 10 mM. Triton X-100 (Fig. 4E) and DMSO (Fig. 4F) had no
significant effect on signal up to 1% and 5%, respectively. DTT was selected to be used at 5 mM
in assays to maintain a reducing environment. Addition of Triton X-100 at 0.01% is expected to
help minimizing binding of fluorophores and proteins to polystyrene plates

and compound

. BSA was also included at 0.01% to prevent non-specific

interactions. Based on optimization results, the final assay buffer and screening conditions
established consisted of 5 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.01% BSA in 10 mM Tris buffer pH
7.5, and incubation time of 30 min.

Using the optimized assay conditions, nsp10-nsp16 complex showed concentration dependent
binding to the FAM-RNA at 30 nM with an apparent Kd of 0.13 ± 0.002 µM and Bmax of 270 ±
5 mP (Fig. 5A). For RNA-displacement assays, the protein complex concentration was kept at
80% of maximum signal (0.5 µM) to allow better competitive displacement. Unlabelled
methylated RNA cap analogues, N7-meGpppG and N7-meGpppA, were used to compete off the

FAM-RNA binding to nsp10-nsp16 complex. Both N7-meGpppG and N7-meGpppA displaced
FAM-RNA with Kdisp values of 17 ± 3 µM and 20 ± 6 µM, respectively (Fig. 5B and 5C), while
unlabelled unmethylated cap analogues GpppG (Fig. 5D) and GpppA (Fig. 5E) were unable to
displace FAM-RNA from nsp10-nsp16 complex. C-terminally biotinylated 5′ N7-methylated
GpppACCCCC 3′ also displaced the FAM-RNA with Kdisp of 4.3 µM (Supplementary Fig. 5).
These observations further confirmed that the nsp10-nsp16 protein complex specifically
recognizes its N7-me RNA substrate.
To determine whether the RNA-displacement assay at optimized conditions is amenable to highthroughput screening, the Z′-factor was determined by performing the assay in a 384-well format
using FAM-RNA (5' N7-meGpppACCCCC-FAM 3′) in the presence (168 data points) and
absence (168 data points) of 50 µM unlabelled RNA (N7-meGpppA). The calculated Z′-factor was
0.6, indicating the assay is suitable for screening for RNA competitive inhibitors (Fig. 5F).

Screening a library of 1124 compounds
We further screened a collection of 1124 small molecules from the Prestwick Chemical Library, a
collection of drugs and drug-like compounds. Screening of this library initially identified 15
compounds as potential antagonists of nsp10-nsp16-RNA interaction based on reduction of
polarization signal (>50% reduction) compared to the control at 50 µM final compound
concentration (Fig. 6).
All 15 compounds were tested for any possible interference with the signal readout, and 12
compounds showed a significant effect and were eliminated. Three compounds showed dosedependent displacement with no signal interference. However, considering the high Hill slopes as
a red flag, we further tested the binding of these 3 compounds to nsp10-nsp16 complex by ITC
and none of the compounds was confirmed. The screening test run once again confirmed the
suitability of the optimized RNA displacement assay for medium to high throughput screening of
nsp10-nsp16 complex.

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic has an unprecedented impact on the global economy and has already
brought the health care services worldwide to a breaking point. So far, there are no approved

vaccine or effective drugs for this disease. Even vaccines developed today may not be effective on
future mutated variants.31 This necessitates the development of therapeutics that could stop the
replication of the SARS-CoV-2. Coronavirus caps its RNA to evade human immune system and
preserve its RNA from degradation, which is essential for viral replication.15, 32 RNA-capping is
catalyzed by non-structural enzymes including nsp16 which is a SAM-dependent RNAmethyltransferase, and active when in complex with nsp10.26 Methyltransferases have been shown
to be druggable33 with more than 20 potent, selective, and cell active small molecules (chemical
probes) discovered for such enzymes in the last decade33. Typically, both SAM34 and substrate
binding sites of methyltransferases could be targeted for drug discovery.33 One of the cost-effective
ways of screening for RNA substrate competitive inhibitors is to label the RNA with fluorescein
and detect its binding to the target RNA methyltransferase by monitoring the change in fluorescent
polarization signal.35 In this study, we have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization
(FP)-based RNA displacement assay in a 384-well format for nsp10-nsp16 complex which is
suitable for screening to identify RNA-competitive inhibitors. This assay is also suitable for
triaging RNA-competitive small molecules from a high number of hits that could be identified by
other types of screening.
SAM has been reported to promote active MERS nsp10-nsp16 complex assembly and SAM/SAH
balance regulating nsp16 activity.26 The Kd values reported for SAM binding to SARS-CoV nsp10nsp16 complex (Kd = 5.59 ± 1.15 µΜ) 22 are within the same range as we report for SARS-CoV2 nsp10-nsp16 complex binding to SAM (Kd = 3.4 ± 1.5 µΜ). This indicates the highly conserved
interaction of co-factor SAM with nsp10-nsp16 from these coronaviruses. The FAM labelled RNA
substrate in this study (5' N7-meGpppACCCCC-FAM 3′) was designed based on the previous
studies on SARS-CoV nsp10-nsp16 complex reporting recognition of cap-0 RNA (N7-meGpppARNA) as substrate but not N7-meGpppG-capped RNA.22 In vitro, RNA substrate for SARS-CoV
nsp10-nsp16 needs to be N7 guanine methylated with adenine (A) as the first nucleotide 23. We
observed no RNA displacement with SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 using the unmethylated RNA
samples such as GpppA and GpppG. These observations are consistent with previous reports on
similar binding assays with SARS-CoV18 and MERS-CoV26 proteins, where nsp16 can
discriminate the cap-0 (N7-meGpppN-RNA) structure from an unmethylated cap structure (N7GpppN-RNA). Nsp10-nsp16 complex was reported active as a type-0 RNA cap-dependent 2’-Omethyltransferasease.23

The RNA-displacement assay in a 384-well format presented in this study provides a cost-effective
method to screen nsp10-nsp16 complex against large libraries of compounds to identify starting
small molecule RNA-competitive inhibitors. Such molecules could lead to developing therapeutics
for COVID-19 through inhibition of viral replication, and likely would be effective on other
coronaviruses due to high conservation of nsp16 among this family of viruses.

Protein expression and purification
DNA sequences encoding the full-length SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 (residues A4254-Q4392 / A1Q139) and nsp16 (residues S6799-N7096 / S1- N298) were chemically synthesized according to
the UniProtKB reference sequence P0DTD1. The DNA fragments were individually cloned into
the pET28-MHL expression vector (GenBank: EF456735.1) adding a N-terminal purification tag
(MHHHHHHSSGRENLYFQG).
Constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) RIL, then the cells were cultured
in LB Broth overnight at 37 °C. The next day, the overnight cultures were used to inoculate Terrific
Broth supplemented with 50 µg/mL Kanamycin and 35 µg/mL chloramphenicol for further
amplification at 37 °C using LEX system (https://www.thesgc.org/science/lex). Once the OD600
of the cultures reached 0.8-1.5, the temperature was lowered to 18 °C and the target proteins were
overexpressed overnight by inducing cells with 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl-1-thio-Dgalactopyranoside). The cells were harvested the next day at 7000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 °C
(Beckman Coulter centrifuge).
Harvested cells from nsp10 and nsp16 cultures were re-suspended in binding buffer containing 50
mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP, 5 mM imidazole and 50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP, 5 mM imidazole, respectively
supplemented with 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (100X protease inhibitor stock in 70% ethanol
containing 0.25 mg/mL Aprotinin, 0.25 mg/mL Leupeptin, 0.25 mg/mL Pepstatin A and 0.25
mg/mL E-64) or Roche complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet. The cells were
lysed chemically by rotating 30 min with CHAPS (final concentration of 0.5%) and 5 µL/L
Benzonase Nuclease (in house) followed by sonication at frequency of 8.0 (10s on/7s off) for 5
min (Sonicator 3000, Misoni). The crude extract was clarified by high-speed centrifugation for 45
min at 16000 rpm at 4 °C (Beckman Coulter centrifuge).
The lysates were then separately loaded onto Ni-NTA affinity resin column (Qiagen) preequilibrated with the corresponding binding buffers. The column for nsp10 was washed with
running wash buffer (binding buffer plus 30 mM imidazole). The column for nsp16 was once
washed by wash buffer and 4 more times with binding buffer. Subsequently, the columns were
eluted with the corresponding binding buffers containing 250 mM imidazole (Fig. S1). Then, the
nsp16 and nsp10 proteins were mixed at 1:8 molar ratio and the mixture was dialyzed in final
buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP for a total
of 60 minutes while spinning at 4 °C. Then, the complex was flash frozen and stored at -80 °C.
We evaluated nsp10-nsp16 complex formation by Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC).
Initially, a SEC standard (Bio-Rad) was loaded onto Superdex 200 16/600 column after
equilibration with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 buffer containing 200 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM
TCEP. The standard peaks were used to plot the calibration curve. Then, the protein sample was
loaded onto the column and the molecular weight of the protein fractions were calculated according
to the calibration curve (Fig. S2). The molecular weight of the nsp10 and nsp16 was confirmed by
