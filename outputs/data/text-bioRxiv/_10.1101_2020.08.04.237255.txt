Abstract
Antimalarial drugs have antimicrobial, antiviral, antimalarial and immunosuppressive activities,
although the mechanisms remain unknown. Quinacrine (QC) increases the antimicrobial activity
against yeast exponentially with a pH-dependent increase in the cationic amphiphilic drug
(CAD) structure. CAD-QC localizes in membranes and induces glucose starvation by
noncompetitively inhibiting glucose uptake. A logarithmic increase in antimicrobial activity with
pH-dependent CAD formation was also observed for chloroquine, indicating that the CAD
structure is crucial for its pharmacological activity. A decrease in CAD structure with a slight
decrease in pH from 7.4 greatly reduced their effects; namely, these drugs would inefficiently act
on falciparum malaria and COVID-19 pneumonia patients with acidosis, resulting in resistance.
Recovering normal blood pH or using pH-insensitive quinoline drugs might be effective.

Introduction
Malaria is one of the most serious infectious parasitic diseases in the world. Quinine (QN) was
the first natural compound to successfully treat malaria. Thereafter, quinacrine (QC) was
developed in 1932 as a synthetic antimalarial drug as an alternative to quinine. QC was used
during World War II until 1945 when it was substituted by chloroquine (CQ) (1). Currently, CQ
is used as an antimalarial drug, although it has no effect on falciparum malaria, and the resistance
mechanism has not been fully elucidated (2, 3). Additionally, QC, CQ and hydroxychloroquine
(HCQ) have been clinically used as immunosuppressive agents for refractory lupus
erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis (2). These antimalarial drugs have various
pharmacological effects, such as antiviral, antimicrobial, and anticancer activities at the cellular
level, and thrombosis prevention (2, 4-15). Therefore, these drugs have the potential to be useful
agents without any significant clinical concerns because of a long history of clinical use.
However, their cellular effects have not often been confirmed at the whole-body level (16). For
drug development, it is necessary to elucidate the discrepancy. Various action mechanisms for
antimalarial drugs have been proposed. CQ accumulates in acidic food vacuoles of the malaria
parasite, thereby exerting antimalarial effects by increasing the pH or accumulating toxic heme
in the vacuoles (2, 17, 18). A similar vacuole accumulation mechanism has been considered for
QC (2, 19). Additionally, QC is thought to inhibit DNA/RNA synthesis (20), calmodulinmediated signaling (21), electron transport (22), and phospholipase A2, and interact with
membrane phospholipids (23, 24). However, there is currently no unified view to explain the
pleiotropic effects of QC and CQ analogs. Several antimalarial drugs inhibit the growth of
pathogenic and budding yeasts without hemoglobin (7-14). Because QC accumulates in the

acidic vacuoles of yeast but not in the nuclei (25), this might be a clue to elucidate the
antimicrobial mechanism.
Antipsychotic phenothiazines, local anesthetics, and cationic surfactants are cationic
amphiphilic drugs (CADs) that induce the glucose starvation mimetic state in budding yeast
irrespective of their structural differences (26). Thus, the CAD structure is important to elucidate
the common mechanism. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a phenothiazine, is the first synthetic
compound with antipsychotic effects (27), and its structure is similar to that of QC. Thus, QC
might also be CAD and induce CAD-like effects in yeast. Here, we demonstrate both the pHdependent structural changes in QC and the nonspecific interactions of the CAD structure with
the membrane are crucial for antimicrobial activity. Additionally, we describe the mechanism by
which QC inhibits hexose transporter function as a target. Finally, we describe the importance of
the CAD structure common to antimalarial quinoline drugs on resistance and propose effective
clinical uses of these drugs.

Results
Structures and physicochemical properties of QC change drastically in response to pH
The tertiary propylamine tail of CPZ is hydrophilic, and the tricyclic ring (phenothiazine)
structure is hydrophobic, thereby forming the CAD structure. Thus, it binds directly to artificial
membranes without proteins (28) and is localized to yeast membranes (26, 29) (Fig. 1A). QC is
also considered to form a CAD structure that contains butyl amino groups as the hydrophilic
region and acridine rings as the hydrophobic region. However, QC localizes to the acidic
vacuoles of yeast, suggesting that QC is not a simple CAD. To ensure the CAD structures of

these compounds, we estimated the physicochemical properties using computational analysis.
The analysis estimated that QC had two acid dissociation constants (pKa 1: 8.37, pKa 2: 10.33)
(Fig. 1B). Because the pKa values of QC are attributed to protonation of the nitrogen in the
acridine ring (a) and of the side chain (b), QC forms three structures in response to pH (Fig. 1B).
The nitrogen atom positively charged by protonation interacts with the negatively charged
oxygen of water, thereby increasing water solubility. Thus, the major structures of QC were the
hydrophilic form (HP-QC) at pH <8.37, the CAD form (CAD-QC) at pH 8.37-10.33, and the
lipophilic form (LP-QC) at pH >10.33. The software also estimated the logD, the pH-dependent
octanol/water partition coefficient (logP) reflecting the lipophilicity of drugs. These analyses
indicate that the lipophilicity of QC increases with increasing CAD-QC at pH values greater than
6. Amphiphilic compounds form micelles, a characteristic property of surfactants, at high
concentrations. Because the critical micelle concentration of QC is 70 mM in aqueous solution
(30), QC would form an amphiphilic structure at neutral pH. Similar pH-dependent structural
changes were estimated in CQ with two pKa values (7.29 and 10.32) (Fig. S1). In contrast, CPZ
has a pKa of 9.2, reflecting protonation of only the nitrogen of the side chain. Thus, the major
structures of CPZ are CAD-CPZ at pH <9.2 and LP-CPZ at pH >9.2 (Fig. S2). The lipophilicity
of CPZ increased with increasing LP-CPZ, although the degree of increase was smaller than
those of QC and CQ, as judged by the logD. These estimations suggest that the lipophilicities of
the antimalarial drugs change drastically in response to pH-dependent structural change
compared with CPZ.

QC alters to the structure inefficiently retaining photoenergy in acidic conditions
HP-QC and CAD-QC exist in the diprotonated (QC·2H+) and monoprotonated forms (QC·H+)
by spectral analysis (31). However, it is unclear which structure the spectrum reflects and the
significance of water on structural change. To determine these factors, we performed 3D
fluorescence analysis (Fig. 2). QC had 3 major excitation peaks (270/360/410 nm) and one
emission peak (500 nm) (Figs. 2A and S4). Because the excitation spectra are attributed to the

number of conjugated double bonds (32), the acridine ring, consisting of 7 conjugated double
bonds, is responsible for the spectrum of QC. The redshift of the emission wavelength is due to
the Stokes shift, where QC loses excitation energy via radiationless deactivation by molecular
motion (Fig. S3). The fluorescence intensities (Em 500) at the three excitation peaks increased
with increasing pH (Fig. 2B), in accordance with the pH-dependent increase in the relative
fluorescence quantum yield (31). Thus, deprotonation of nitrogen in the ring with a pH increase
contributes to the fluorescence increase (Figs. 2B and S3A).
Apparent difference in the maximum emission wavelengths at Ex410 was not observed in
water solutions with a pH decrease (Fig. S3B). Thus, the decrease in fluorescence with
decreasing pH might not be typical radiationless deactivation. Presumably, the protonated
nitrogen in the acridine ring would increase its electrical interaction with polar water molecules.
If the interaction with water is responsible for the fluorescence decrease, the fluorescence should
increase in nonpolar solutions. Indeed, the fluorescence at the three excitation peaks increased in
an octanol solution (Fig. 2B), indicating that protonation of the acridine ring would partially
dissipate the photoexcitation energy into the water as a quencher. Hence, QC would alter to the
structure inefficiently retaining the photoenergy under acidic conditions.

CAD-QC is formed at physiological pH
Three major excitation peaks (270/360/410 nm) reflect the number of conjugated double bonds
in the acridine ring (32). Ex270 would excite the pyridine and two benzene structures (3
conjugated double bonds) in the ring (Fig. 2A). Because only the nitrogen of pyridine is
protonated (1/3) but the two benzenes are not, Ex270 would reflect the effect of one protonation
against the 9 conjugated double bonds (1/9) consisting of independent 3 structures. Ex360 would
excite two redundant structures consisting of the quinoline structure (5 conjugated double
bonds), Because each the nitrogen is protonated, Ex360 would reflect the effect of two
protonation against the 5 conjugated double bonds (2/5). Ex410 would excite the whole acridine
ring (7 conjugated double bonds) and reflect the protonation effect of 1/7. The acridine ring is
almost completely protonated as HP-QC at pH 5, whereas it deprotonates with increasing pH,
and is completely deprotonated as CAD-QC (LP-QC) in octanol, as estimated in Fig. 1B. Thus,
the fluorescence ratios (Em 500) of each pH/pH 5 solution by each excitation peak would reflect
the deprotonation/protonation (CAD/HP) ratio of the pyridine (Ex270), quinoline (Ex360), and
acridine (Ex410) structures, and the ratios of octanol/pH 5 solution are the maximum CAD/HP
ratios. These fluorescence ratios increased with increasing pH (Fig. 2C). In particular, the
maximum CAD/HP ratio at Ex360 was 2.6-fold higher than those at Ex270 and Ex410. This is
similar to the ratios of the protonation effect estimated by the structures Ex360/Ex270 (3.6:18/5)
and Ex360/Ex410 (2.8:14/5). These results indicate that CAD-QC is formed at physiological pH
and that Ex360 efficiently detects CAD-QC.

HP-QC but not CAD-QC is excluded by the membrane system
To determine the pH effects on the interaction of QC with cells, the amount of QC adsorbing to
yeast cells were determined at various pH values (5-9). In living cells, the cell-adsorbed
fluorescence increased with the pH-dependent increase in CAD-QC (Fig. 3A), indicating that
CAD-QC, but not HP-QC, is taken into cells. In cells treated with ethanol that destroyed the
membrane structure or with formaldehyde that caused a loss in membrane protein function, the
fluorescence increased at pH 5-7 but not at pH 8. This suggests that HP-QC is excluded by the
membrane system at pH ≤ 7, and CAD-QC is taken into cells via the membrane system at pH 8.
Because the fluorescence increased at pH 9 irrespective of treatment, LP-QC might also adsorb
to insoluble materials such as the cell wall other than membranes.

CAD-QC localizes at membranes
We observed the localization of QC in yeast at pH 7.5 (CAD-QC: 11.8%) and pH 6 (CAD-QC:
0.4 %) (Fig. 3B). At pH 7.5 (2% glucose), the QC signal excited by 410 nm blue light was
detected in acidic vacuoles and weakly in the plasma membrane. UV light at 360 nm
preferentially detected signals in both plasma and vacuolar membranes, indicating that CAD-QC
localizes in the membrane. At pH 6.0, weak QC signals were observed in the plasma membrane
but not in vacuoles, irrespective of the excitation light and glucose, indicating that HP-QC is not
efficiently taken into the cells as seen in Fig. 3A. At pH 7.5 without glucose required for
vacuolar protonation, QC signals were observed in the plasma and vacuolar membranes,
although unknown granules formed immediately upon UV exposure. Therefore, CAD-QC would
penetrate into lipid membranes due to its amphiphilic structure.

CAD-QC is crucial for antimicrobial activity
To determine the biological activity of QC, its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was
determined at the physiological pH (5-8) of yeast. The MIC is a relative value in response to the
cell number. Under these conditions, using 1.25 × 105 cells in 100 µl, the MICs were 50 mM (pH
6), 2.5 mM (pH 7), and 83 µM (pH 8). Yeast grew normally at 50 mM and pH 5 (CAD-QC:
0.04 %, HP-QC: 99.96 %), indicating that HP-QC does not have antimicrobial activity, as
observed in the other microorganisms (7, 8). This indicates that the antimicrobial activity of QC
increased approximately 600-fold from pH 6 to 8 and 30-fold from pH 7 to 8 (Fig. 4A).
Similarly, the antimicrobial activity of CQ increased approximately 30-fold from pH 7 (MIC: 15

13

mM) to pH 8 (MIC: 520 µM), although the yeast grew normally at 60 mM and pH 6 (Fig. S4). In
contrast, because the MICs of CPZ without the HP structure were 250 µM (pH 6), 31 µM (pH 7),
and 15 µM (pH 8), the antimicrobial activity of CPZ increased approximately 16-fold from pH 6
to 8 and 2-fold from pH 7 to 8. Thus, the drastic change in the antimicrobial activity of the
antimalarial drugs is largely attributed to the pH-dependent structural change of CAD from HP,
rather than biological mechanisms. Presumably, CAD-QC but not HP-QC exerts antimicrobial
activity via nonspecific interactions with membranes.

panel C are plotted against the concentration. The concentrations of QC where the ATP amount was 0.5
nM/OD600 are indicated in parentheses. Data are the mean (SE) (n = 3), *p = 0.015.

CAD-QC induces glucose-starved reactions via membrane interactions
Excessive amounts of glucose alleviate the antimicrobial activities of yeast induced by CADs,
such as the local anesthetic tetracaine and CPZ, irrespective of structural differences (26). Thus,
it might also alleviate the effects induced by CAD-QC. The MICs at 8% glucose were 2-fold
higher than those at 2% glucose at pH 7-8 (CAD-QC: 4-29.6 %), whereas no change in MIC was
observed by excessive glucose at pH 6 (CAD-QC: 0.4 %) (Fig. 4A). This suggests that CAD-QC
induces glucose starvation. The above CADs inhibit translation initiation and actin polarization
in yeast as glucose-starved reactions and lyse the cells at high concentrations via amphiphilic
structures (26, 33). QC inhibited translation initiation at pH 7.5, which was slightly alleviated by
8% glucose, as judged by polysome/monosome ratios (Fig. 4B). QC also inhibited actin

polarization in a dose-dependent manner at pH 7.5 but not pH 6.0, and this inhibition was
partially alleviated by 8% glucose, as judged by the half inhibitory concentration(IC50)(Fig. 4C).
Similarly, QC lysed yeast cells at high concentrations and was slightly alleviated by 8% glucose,
as judged by extracellular ATP amounts (Fig. 4D). Thus, CAD-QC but not HP-QC induced
glucose-starved reactions in yeast via membrane interactions, and eventually destroyed the
membrane at high concentrations.

CAD-QC noncompetitively inhibits hexose transport
Because hexose transporters localize at plasma membranes to take up environmental hexoses
(26, 34, 35), CAD-QC might inhibit transporter function as a membrane target. We evaluated the
effect of QC on the initial rate of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake (zero-trans influx) in the
glucose-starved HXT2m strain expressing only a high-affinity hexose transporter. QC inhibited
2DG uptake in a dose-dependent manner at pH 7.5 more efficiently than at pH 6, as judged by
the IC50 (Fig. 5A). Thus, CAD-QC strongly inhibits the function of hexose transporters on the
plasma membrane. To determine the inhibition mechanism of Hxt by CAD-QC, the kinetic
parameters for 2DG uptake inhibition were determined at pH 7.5 (Fig. 5B). In the absence of
QC, the Km value of Hxt2 was approximately 0.8 mM, which was similar but slightly less than
the value (1.5 mM) determined by the radioisotope method in the hxt1-7 null mutant expressing
the HXT2 gene (36). The Vmax value (710 nmol/min·mg cells, equivalent to 208
nmol/min·OD600) was higher than that in a previous report (97 nmol/min·mg cells) (36), possibly
because of the high expression of HXT2 on the multicopy vector. The Vmax values decreased
with increasing QC, but the Km values did not, indicating that QC inhibits 2DG transport of

Hxt2 noncompetitively at pH 7.5. Therefore, CAD-QC would inhibit Hxt2 function by
interacting with sites other than the hexose recognition site.

Discussion
Various action and resistance mechanisms of antimalarial drugs have been studied regarding the
biological aspects of parasites (2, 37). However, we focused on pH-dependent structural changes
in the drug mechanisms and categorized the structures of QC into the HP, CAD, and LP forms.
Basically, the interaction of QC with cells obeyed the pH partition hypothesis: ionized drugs
diffuse through biological membranes primarily in their unionized form, and the extent of drug
absorbed across membranes depends on the degree of ionization (38). However, this hypothesis
considers the action of the ionized drug in the cytoplasm but not in the membrane. Although
structural changes in ionized QCs are known as QC·2H+ and QC·H+ (31), their biological
significance remains unknown. In addition, it seems that the obvious accumulation of these

ionized QCs into acidic organelles confused the elucidation of the action mechanism. Here, we
describe the importance of the CAD form on biological activity.

Nonspecific interaction of CAD-QC with the membrane inhibits various membrane targets,
including hexose transporters
HP-QC easily dissolves in water but hardly interacts with insoluble materials such as the cell
wall and membranes (Figs. 1B and 3A); thus, it would hardly have antimicrobial activity (Fig.
4A). CAD-QC could easily adsorb to cells (Fig. 3A) and penetrate nonspecifically into
membrane lipids via the CAD structure (Fig. 3B). It would stably interact with the negatively
charged inner leaflets of the lipid bilayer via electrostatic interactions, as CPZ does (26,28,29),
and affect various membrane targets, thereby exerting strong antimicrobial activity (Fig. 4A).
Since the HP and CAD forms exist as mixtures at the physiological pH values (5-8) of yeast, the
antimicrobial activity is determined by the pH-dependent abundance ratio of CAD-QC (Fig. 1B).
Although LP-QC does not exist at pH 5-8 (Fig. 1B), CAD-QC would convert into LP-QC at the
waterless center of the lipid bilayer during translocation into the cytoplasm. Thus, LP-QC would
also exist in the cell membrane in proportion to the extracellular CAD-QC abundance.
Consequently, the interaction of the CAD form with the membrane is crucial for its
pharmacological effects such as antimicrobial activity.
The nonspecific interaction of QC with the membrane affects numerous membrane
targets, thereby exhibiting various phenotypes, as observed for various CADs (4, 39).
Nevertheless, the hexose transporter is an important membrane target for QC in yeast because
additional glucose alleviates the antimicrobial activity (Fig. 4A) and QC induces glucose
starvation reactions (Fig. 4B and C) and inhibits the uptake of 2DG (Fig. 5). Because the yeast

hexose transporter is the largest family encoded by 18 genes, Hxts would be abundant in the
plasma membrane (34). Thus, the nonspecific interaction of QC would noncompetitively inhibit
the function at the lateral side of abundant Hxts with high probability (Fig. 5), resulting in
preferential glucose starvation according to the lipid theory (26). Although QC is eventually
translocated into acidic vacuoles, inhibition would be maintained as long as QC exists outside
the cells. Practically, additional glucose increases the MICs at pH 7-8 only two-fold (Fig. 4A).
Additionally, the IC50 of QC for Hxt2 inhibition at pH 8 was approximately 1/10 of that at pH 6
(Fig. 5A), although the MIC of QC at pH 8 was approximately 1/600 of that at pH 6 (Fig. 4A).
These results indicate that CAD-QC affects antimicrobial targets other than Hxt. Because CQ
and QN, having the CAD structure (Fig. S5), are known to inhibit the transport of iron (10),
tryptophan, tyrosine (11), glucose (12), and thiamine (13) in budding yeast, CAD-QC might also
inhibit the transport of these nutrients. Furthermore, the local anesthetic tetracaine, a CAD,
increases the membrane targets with the dose increase and finally destroys the membrane (40),
similar to CAD-QC (Fig. 4D). Since these effects would result from nonspecific interactions of
the CAD structure with the membrane, the mode of inhibition of other targets might be similar to
the inhibition mechanism of Hxt2. These ideas are summarized in Fig. 5C.
This mechanism would be applicable for various organisms having membranes and
exhibit two pharmacological effects. First, nonspecific interactions with the membrane would
inhibit the functions of various membrane proteins, including the nutrient uptake system, thereby
inducing nutrient starvation. This would suppress cellular function and might be responsible for
the pleiotropic pharmacological effects, such as antimalarial, antifungal, anticancer, and
immunosuppressive effects (2-15). Second, membranes containing foreign compounds such as
QC and CQ do not have normal functions for membrane fusion/separation between the host and

parasites/enveloped viruses, thereby exhibiting antimalarial and antiviral activities (2, 4-6).
Because this mechanism is also based on nonspecific interactions of the CAD structure with the
membrane, CADs might be effective drugs to suppress parasitic/microbial/viral infections
irrespective of protein alteration by gene mutation.

A decrease in the CAD structure in acidic environments accounts for drug resistance
The Meyer-Overton correlation was discovered over 120 years ago and states that the anesthetic
potency of various anesthetics increases logarithmically with lipophilicity (41). This is a
prototype for the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) in which the biological
potency of various drugs increases logarithmically with lipophilicity/hydrophobicity (42),
although it remains unclear whether drugs target lipids or proteins. The MICs of QC and CQ
decreased logarithmically with logD increases from pH 5-8 (Fig. S5). This result indicates that
the same compound with various lipophilicities obeys the Meyer-Overton correlation, thereby
avoiding complicated interpretations due to various structures. To put the correlation differently,
the drastic logarithmic decrease in MIC would be determined by the amount of the CAD
structure interacting with membrane lipids, thereby supporting lipid theory.
The MICs of QC, CQ and CPZ were determined from linear QSAR models regressed as a
function of pH (Fig. S5B). According to these models, the dose ratios equivalent to the MICs at
pH 7.4 were plotted around the normal human blood pH (Fig. 6A). Similar ratio changes were
observed for QC and CQ, but not CPZ without the HP structure. This indicates that a slight
change in pH at the clinical level would largely affect the effects of the antimalarial drugs. For
example, for the effects equivalent to pH 7.4, pH 7.2 and pH 7.6 would require 2-fold and onehalf the dose, respectively. Presumably, the ratios would be similar to those for the inhibition of

parasitic/viral infections because these ratios are attributed to the pH-dependent structural change
of CAD from HP, although precise estimation of the ratio might require a model between pH and
these phenomena. Hence, these antimalarial drugs would show a reduction in their
pharmacological effects with a slight decrease in blood pH. Various quinoline antimalarial drugs
would also be pH-dependent CADs because their nitrogen atoms are protonated (Fig. S5) (2).
Computational analysis estimated the pH distributions of their CAD structures (Fig. 6B).
According to the distributions, because the CAD structure of HCQ decreased with a slight pH
decrease, the pharmacological effects are also predicted to decrease, as in the case of QC and
CQ, although the other quinoline drugs showed different distribution patterns.

Fig. 6. The activities of antimalarial drugs change with pH
(A) The dose ratios equivalent to the MICs of QC, CQ, and CPZ at normal human blood pH (7.4) were
plotted at the range of pH 7-8, according to the linear models in Fig. S4. (B) The distributions of the CAD
structures of various antimalarial drugs and the antipsychotic CPZ at different pH values were estimated
using MarvinSketch. Green and red zones indicate normal and abnormal acidic ranges of human blood
pH, respectively. The green dotted line indicates the CAD distribution of the ideal drug to treat for blood
infection. Abbreviations, QC: quinacrine, CQ: quinacrine, HCQ: hydroxychloroquine, QN: quinine, PQ:

There is a variety of pH values in human tissues, such as gastric acid (< 3.5), urine (6),
the liver (7.2), blood (7.4), pancreatic secretions (8.1), and the brain (7) (43, 44). Thus, the
potency of quinoline drugs evaluated at a simple pH would be different from those in the whole
body with complicated pH values. Additionally, microorganisms such as yeast and cancer cells
produce acidic metabolites, thereby lowering the pH of their microenvironments (7, 8, 45). In
these acidic environments, several quinoline drugs would not act efficiently. For example,
falciparum malaria is known to be resistant to CQ. Because the common manifestation of
falciparum malaria is acidosis irrespective of age (3), CQ would not act efficiently on falciparum
malaria causing acidic blood. Hypnozoites of vivax and ovale malaria in the liver are also
resistant to CQ (3). This is also possibly due to the low pH (7.2) of the liver. Importantly,
although these cases are recognized as drug resistance, there would be a decrease in drug potency
from structural alterations in acidic environments. This should be distinguished from biological
mechanisms such as drug efflux. Interestingly, quinine (QN) and primaquine (PQ) are effective
for falciparum malaria and hypnozoites, respectively (3). Because these drugs form the CAD

structure over a wide pH range (Fig. 6B), they would act effectively even in acidic environments.
Mefloquine (MQ) is also effective for falciparum malaria but has adverse psychiatric effects (3).
Because the pH distribution of the CAD structure is similar to that of the antipsychotic CPZ (Fig.
6B), MQ acts on the brain with a low pH similar to CPZ. This suggests that drugs with a CAD
structure over a wide pH range induce unexpected adverse effects by persistently interacting in
tissues with various pH values. Therefore, it is important to know the pH at the pathogenic site
and find/design a drug forming the CAD structure only at the pH of the pathogenic site.
Presumably, this would create a useful drug with few adverse effects.

The way to use antimalarial drugs efficiently
Administration doses of the drugs would be relatively determined by their lipophilicity (logP,
logD) according to the Meyer-Overton correlation. However, it is important to take into account
pH when using pH-dependent CADs, including antimalarial drugs. When the pathogenic site is
the blood and the patient's blood pH is higher than 7.4 from alkalosis, the dose of antimalarial
drugs such as QC, CQ and HCQ should be reduced because of increased potency and toxicity
(Fig. 4C and D). When the pH is lower than 7.4, such as in falciparum malaria (3) and COVID19 pneumonia patients with acidosis, the conventional dose would not reach the minimum
effective concentration. In these cases, the drug dose should be increased. However, overdose
might cause adverse effects by adsorption into alkaline tissues other than vessels (Fig. 3A). To
avoid this, achieving normal blood pH by clinical treatment might be effective at the
conventional dose of antimalarial drugs. Alternatively, QN, PQ, and MQ with a wide pH range of
the CAD structure might be effective irrespective of acidosis (Fig. 6B), although attention to
their adverse effects is required.
