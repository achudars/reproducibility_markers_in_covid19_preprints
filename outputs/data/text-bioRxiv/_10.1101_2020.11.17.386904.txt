Abstract
Following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the search for an effective and rapidly available treatment

was initiated worldwide based on repurposing of available drugs. Previous reports described the

antiviral activity of certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the Abelson kinase 2 against

pathogenic coronaviruses. Imatinib, one of them, has more than twenty years of safe utilization for

the

treatment of hematological malignancies. In

this context,

Imatinib

was

rapidly evaluated in

clinical trials against Covid-19. Here, we present the pre-clinical evaluation of Imatinib in multiple

models. Our results indicated that Imatinib and another TKI, the Masitinib, exhibit an antiviral activity

in

VeroE6

cells.

However,

Imatinib

was

inactive

in

a

reconstructed

bronchial

human

airway

epithelium model. In vivo, Imatinib therapy failed to impair SARS-CoV-2 replication in a golden Syrian

hamster model despite high concentrations in plasma and in the lung.

Overall, these results do not

support the use of Imatinib and similar TKIs as antivirals in the treatment of Covid-19.

the

emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), both associated with a high proportion of severe

acute respiratory syndromes, raised fears of coronavirus-induced pandemic (de Wit et al., 2016). In

late 2019, another coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-

2) emerged in China. Once again this new viral pathogen was associated with severe respiratory

infections (Zhu et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 human disease, called coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19),

was characterized as a pandemic on March 2020 by the World Health Organization. To date, there is

no licensed vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 but many candidates are in development (Jeyanathan et al.,

2020). Without licensed antiviral drugs that specifically target coronaviruses, drug repurposing has

been considered as the fastest strategy to find an antiviral specific therapy since the conventional

development of new drugs may take several years (Manganaro et al., 2020). However, and after a

plethora of clinical trials in a desperate attempt to rapidly

find efficient antiviral therapies and

adjunctive treatments for the management of moderate to critical Covid-19, the only breakthrough,

yet, was a supportive therapy (The RECOVERY Collaborative Group, 2020).

A few years ago, a screen of clinically developed drugs identified two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs),

Imatinib and Dasatinib as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in vitro (Dyall et

al., 2014). In VeroE6 cells, Imatinib exhibited 50% dose effective concentrations (EC50) of 17.7µM

and 9.8µM against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, respectively. Imatinib antiviral activity was then more

precisely investigated in vitro, in multiple cell lines and with three different coronavirus: SARS-CoV,

MERS-CoV and

infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Coleman

et al.,

2016; Sisk et al.,

2018).

Hence,

imatinib inhibits coronavirus replication cycle prior to viral RNA replication probably by preventing

the

coronavirus

spike

protein

mediated

cell

fusion

(Sisk

et

al.,

2018).

This

blockage

is

the

consequence of the inhibition of a specific tyrosine kinase, the Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase 2

(Abl2)(Coleman et al., 2016). Indeed, some TKIs, such as the Imatinib, target multiple tyrosine kinases

including the Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase 1 and 2 (Abl1 and 2), the stem cell factor receptor (c-

KIT/CD117) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R). In the context of the current

Covid-19 pandemic, these reports took a new twist and opened the door to the direct availability of

potential

direct

antiviral

drugs

against

SARS-CoV-2.

Indeed

Imatinib,

which

has

been

initially

developed twenty years ago for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), has a long

history of human use (Henkes et al., 2008). Consequently, several clinical trials using Imatinib were

started in Covid-19 patients (Ashkan, 2020; ROUSSELOT, 2020). However, the antiviral activity of TKIs

against SARS-CoV-2 was not thoroughly evaluated in vitro and in vivo.

Here

we present the

preclinical evaluation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, especially the

Imatinib,

against SARS-CoV-2. First, we have evaluated the efficacy of three kinase inhibitors in vitro and we

then assessed the Imatinib antiviral activity using bronchial human airway epithelium (HAE) and in

vivo.

Quantification of Imatinib in plasma and lung tissues (collected as described above) was performed

by a validated sensitive and selective validated high-performance liquid chromatography coupled

with tandem mass spectrometry method (UPLC-TQD, Waters, USA) as previously described (Ferrer et

3.87%). Precision and accuracy of the three quality control samples (QCs) were within 15% over the

calibration range (25 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL).

To assess the selectivity and specificity of the method and matrix effect applied to animal study,

blank plasma and tissues homogenates from two control animals (uninfected and untreated) were

processed at each run. Moreover, the same control samples spiked with Imatinib concentration

First, we evaluated the antiviral activity of several TKIs (Imatinib, Masitinib and Asciminib) against

SARS-CoV-2 using an antiviral assay in VeroE6 cells as previously described (Touret et al., 2020). This

assay estimates the viral inhibition by

measuring the viral genomic RNA replication by qRT-PCR

(Touret et al., 2019). Imatinib and Masinitib inhibited SARS-Cov-2 replication with EC50s of 2.5 and

2.3µM respectively (Fig 1 A, B and D), similar with recent reports for SARS-CoV-2 (Drayman et al.,

2020; Han et al., 2020) but slightly lower than those found for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Dyall et al.,

2014).

to the drug during three days through their basolateral side (Fig 2A). Remdesivir at 10 µM was used

as a positive control for antiviral activity (Pizzorno et al., 2020). We monitored viral excretion at the

apical side of the epithelium from 2 dpi to 4 dpi by measuring viral RNA yields (Fig.3B) and infectious

titres (Fig 2C) in apical washes using respectively quantitative real time RT-PCR and TCID50 assays.
Despite a small non-significant reduction of viral RNA yields at 2 dpi with the highest concentration of

Imatinib, results showed no significant antiviral activity at any dose. Similar results were found when

measuring intracellular viral RNA yields at 4 dpi (Supplemental Fig1). In contrast, Remdesivir induced

strong antiviral activity.

In order to confirm these first results, the experiment was repeated two

times and the same results were obtained: Imatinib treatment at the three highest doses had no

impact on viral replication (Supplemental Fig2).

As Imatinib had the best SI and was under evaluation in clinical trials, we evaluated its antiviral

activity in a previously described hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Chan et al., 2020; Driouich

et al., 2020). To assess the efficacy of Imatinib, groups of 4 hamsters were intranasally infected with

4

10

TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 and received the drug orally twice a day (BID). We used two doses of

Imatinib: 16 and 32mg/day BID (corresponding to 267±23 and 514±45mg/kg/day BID respectively). A

group of 4 hamsters that orally received saline solution BID was used as control. The treatment wa s

initiated the day of infection and ended 2 days post-infection (dpi) (Fig 3A). Viral replication in lungs

and plasma was assessed at 3 dpi. This experimental design, with animals infected with a low dose of

SARS-CoV-2 and sacrificed at the peak of replication previously proved to be highly sensitive to assess

(Fig

and

In

contrast,

administration of Favipiravir led to significant reductions of both infectious titers and viral RNA yields

in

clarified

lung

homogenates

( p=0.0005

and

p=0.0003

respectively).

Likewise,

treatment

with

Imatinib, whatever the dose administrated, did not affect significantly the molecular plasma viral

loads. Animals treated with the dose of 32mg/day BID of Imatinib showed signs of toxicity from 3 dpi,

with their mean normalized weight becoming significantly lower than that of untreated animals

(Supplemental Fig.3).

In order to confirm these first results, the experiment was repeated with groups of 6 hamsters and

the same conclusions were made: administration of Imatinib at both dosing regimens had no impact

on viral replication in clarified lung homogenates and plasma whereas Favipiravir therapy led to a

significant reduction of viral replication in all conditions (Supplemental Fig4).

according to the dosing regimen. At both dosing regimens, lung concentrations of Imatinib were

above the EC50. The inhibitory quotient (IQ: ratio between the concentration and the EC50) in

plasma and lungs was 23 and 11 at 32 mg/day and 3 and 2.8 at 16 mg/day, respectively (table 1).

Discussion

Imatinib was previously identified and studied as an in vitro inhibitor of several coronaviruses in

multiple cell-lines. It prevents the spike protein mediated fusion with the cell membrane by targeting

the Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase 2 (Abl2) (Coleman et al., 2016; Dyall et al., 2014; Sisk et al.,

2018). Our in vitro results confirm that this mode of action seems to be identical with the SARS-CoV-

2. Indeed only Imatinib and Masitinib, that share the same targets (Abl 1, abl2 and c-KIT/CD117)

(Dubreuil et al., 2009; Mahon et al., 2000), were able to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro .

The third TKI tested, the Asciminib, which targets only Abl1 (Schoepfer et al., 2018), was found

inactive. Altogether, these results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 also depends on Abl2 for its entry and

replication in VeroE6 cells. Moreover a recent report also shown that Imatinib block SARS-CoV-2

entry

using human pluripotent

stem

cell-derived lung and colonic

organoids,

with similar EC50,

suggesting that this antiviral mechanism is conserved in multiple cell lines (Han et al., 2020).

However, in spite of its undeniable activity in several cell models, Imatinib was not active in bronchial

human airway epithelia that had been reconstructed from human primary cells of bronchial biopsies,

despite the expression of Abl2 in lung tissue (Uhlén et al., 2015). Imatinib also failed to reduce lung

viral replication at the peak of replication. It is unlikely that an insufficient pulmonary diffusion of

Imatinib may explain this result, since a good penetration of Imatinib in the pulmonary tract was

observed with trough concentrations in lung tissue above the EC50 value with both dosing regimens

tested. Another hypothesis may be the non-conservation of Abl2 kinase between hamsters and

primates. However, it turns out that the gene coding for Abl2 is highly conserved among vertebrates

(Colicelli, 2010). Another explanation may be a difference in term of viral spread/replication between

a cell monolayer and more complex tissues such as lungs and HAE. Indeed, the proposed mode

action of Imatinib is to interfere with the viral entry step, but this inhibition solely may be insufficient

in a more complex three-dimensional tissue :once the virus has entered the cell, it may use another

pathway

to

infect

surrounding

cells,

like

cell-to

cell

transfer

as

previously

described

for

other

enveloped human viruses (Merwaiss et al., 2019; Mothes et al., 2010; Sattentau, 2008).

Taken together, these results indicate that the antiviral activity of Imatinib is only present in cell

cultures, and that its capacity to prevent viral replication is absent in a small animal model or in

reconstructed

bronchial

human

airway epithelia.

These

results

highlight the

need

for combined

approaches during the preclinical evaluation of antiviral compounds even in the case of developing a

drug repurposing approach. Indeed, the use of relevant animal model and relevant tissue may give

precious information to clinicians who would be able more to eliminate rapidly compounds without

antiviral activity or that insufficiently diffused in targeted tissues. This have been already observed

for the chloroquine where the molecule block efficiently the viral replication in veroE6 cells ((Liu et

al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) but displayed less potency in human lung cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020)

and no activity in HAE and non-human primates (Maisonnasse et al., 2020).

In conclusion, these

results do not support the use of Imatinib and similar TKIs as antivirals for the treatment of Covid-19.
