Abstract

36

While mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are an appealing therapeutic option for a range of clinical

37

applications, their potential to induce clotting when used systemically remains a safety concern,

38

particularly in hypercoagulable conditions, such as in patients with severe COVID-19, trauma, or cancers.

39

Here, we tested a novel ex vivo approach aimed at improving the safety of MSC systemic administration

40

by use of a bioreactor. In this device, MSCs are seeded on the outside of a hollow-fiber filter,

41

sequestering them behind a hemocompatible membrane, while still maintaining cross talk with blood

42

cells and circulating signaling molecules. The potential for these bioreactor MSCs to induce clots in

43

coagulable plasma was compared against “free” MSCs, as a model of systemic administration, which

44

were directly injected into the circuit. Our results showed that physical isolation of the MSCs via a

45

bioreactor extends the time necessary for clot formation to occur when compared to “free” MSCs.

46

Measurement of cell surface data indicates the presence of known clot inducing factors, namely tissue

47

factor and phosphatidylserine. Results also showed that recovering cells and flushing the bioreactor

48

prior to use further prolonged clot formation time. Further, application of this technology in two in vivo

49

models did not require additional heparin to maintain target ACT levels relative to the acellular device.

50

Taken together, the use of hollow fiber filters to house MSCs, if adopted clinically, could offer a novel

51

method to control systemic MSC exposure and prolong clot formation time.

Introduction

53

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are potent immunoregulators with strong preclinical data that

54

support their application in a wide range of clinical conditions [1-4]. MSCs can provide therapeutic

55

benefit to patients suffering from systemic inflammation by effectively immunomodulating peripheral

56

blood cells to reduce inflammatory signaling and promote homeostasis. Significant evidence of these

57

MSC derived effects have been shown in vitro, in animal models, and in clinical trials, including recently

58

under an emergency IND application or expanded access protocol with COVID-19 infected patients [5-

59

10]. However, it is known that under certain conditions MSCs may be pro-coagulable and promote

60

instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR), likely through the expression of known

61

coagulation factors on their cell surfaces and in the production of cellular microvesicles [11-14]. Two

62

such factors, tissue factor and phosphatidylserine are known to be integral in physiological coagulation

63

[15-18]. Phosphatidylserine is a major component of cell-based coagulation, enhancing coagulation

64

activity through the charge-based binding of coagulation factor zymogens and cofactors to increase

65

formation of the tenase and prothrombinase complexes [19-21]. This binding effectively enhances clot

66

formation potential, exacerbating a response when a physiological trigger of coagulation, such as tissue

67

factor, is present [18, 21, 22]. When MSCs are introduced into systemic circulation they bring with them

68

the tissue factor expressed on their cell surface. MSCs sourced from different donors and locations

69

(bone marrow, BM-MSCs, adipose-derived, AD-MSCs, umbilical cord, UC-MSCs) vary in tissue factor

70

expression, with higher levels of tissue factor correlating with quicker clot formation and IBMR. BM-

71

MSCs, the most commonly used, have been widely shown to have the least tissue factor expression [16,

72

18].

73

Reducing potential MSC driven clot formation has been a major focus for both academic and clinical

74

groups over the last decade. Advances have been made to mitigate these risks including changing the

75

MSC mode of delivery away from systemic exposure via intravenous (IV) infusion towards localized

76

injection. However, in some cases, systemic IV infusions could provide the highest therapeutic potential.

77

Minimizing clot formation potential could improve therapeutic efficacy, and also increase safety of the

78

treatment in hypercoagulable patients such as patients with COVID-19 in the ICU [23-26]. To that end,

79

increasingly rigorous release criteria during MSC clinical manufacturing are now being applied. Cell

80

populations with low tissue factor are being selected and ‘fresh’ or recovered MSCs with lower surface

81

phosphatidylserine exposure are preferred [17, 27]. Additional clot mitigation approaches are being

82

evaluated, including shifting delivery of the MSCs from intravenous to intramuscular administration,

83

emphasizing higher cell viability, or even using gene modification to promote cell survival [28-31].

84

We propose an alternative approach which would minimize direct exposure of the MSCs to blood and

85

contain MSCs in one location. We utilized a recently described perfusion platform that incorporates a

86

hollow-fiber filter into a fluid circuit to compartmentalize the MSCs, while still allowing exchange of

87

signaling molecules from perfusate to cells, and vice-versa [32]. MSCs within this platform were shown

88

to effectively retain their immunomodulatory capacity and alter perfused lymphocyte proliferation,

89

activation, and cytokine production in an MSC dose and duration exposure dependent manner, despite

90

having minimal direct contact with the blood cells.

91

Benchtop coagulation assays, including microfluidic setups, are becoming increasingly translationally

92

relevant[33]. Here, we used a MSC bioreactor platform to assay whether limiting the direct exposure of

93

fresh frozen pooled plasma from healthy patients to MSCs, and therefore the available tissue factor and

94

phosphatidylserine of the MSCs, would affect clot formation time (CFT) in a modified plasma-based clot

95

formation assay [34, 35]. Plasma was perfused through bioreactors seeded with MSCs as well as through

96

circuits in which cells were directly injected into the perfused plasma to make comparative CFT

97

measurements. We were able to show that bioreactor use significantly prolonged CFT relative to direct

98

injection of the MSCs. Flushing of concentrated soluble factors from bioreactors further contributed to

99

prolonged CFTs. Lastly, the previously proposed clinical solution for MSC driven clot formation,

100

anticoagulation with heparin [36-39], was shown to be effective in both perfusion setups. These results

101

suggest this new modality for systemic MSC delivery may offer a safer alternative to intravenous MSC

102

injection. The clinically scaled ex vivo engineered MSC delivery is currently undergoing testing in a Phase

103

I/II trial in acute kidney injury (AKI) and COVID-19 associated AKI.

MSC Cell Source and Culture Processes

107

Human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells were isolated from 3 separate donors. Cells

108

were cultured and propagated either in-house using proprietary techniques at developed Sentien

109

Biotechnologies (MA, USA) or RoosterBio (MD, USA) and cryopreserved at early passage (P3-P5). Cells

110

were cultured using 2D planar growth conditions. Cells from Sentien Biotechnologies were cultured in

111

aMEM media (HyClone, UT, USA, SH3A5195) containing FGF and FBS, while Roosterbio cells were

112

expanded in xeno-free RoosterNourish-MSC-CC media (RoosterBio, MD, USA, KT-021). All human

113

samples were obtained from commercial vendors under a consented protocol for research purposes

114

only.

115

MSC Direct Injection

116

MSCs were thawed from cryopreservation into citrated fresh-frozen pooled plasma (FFPP) (George King

117

Bio-Medical, KS, USA) and counted via Trypan Blue exclusion. Each direct injection subgroup was

118

processed individually and subgroups were never combined. The fresh thawed direct injection subgroup

119

was placed into plasma after counting and directly injected for perfusion (Figure 2). The recovered direct

120

injection subgroup allowed for 24 hours of recovery on a cell culture dish, followed by dissociation with

121

TryPLE, counting via Trypan Blue exclusion, and placing into plasma prior to direct injection. Cells for use

122

in washed groups were washed with saline directly after thaw, pelleted and resuspended in fresh

123

citrated media prior to direct injection.

126

MSCs were thawed from cryopreservation into aMEM supplemented with 10% HSA and counted via

127

Trypan Blue exclusion prior to seeding in device. The desired cell number was suspended into 9 mL of

128

aMEM and then seeded into saline-primed microreactors (Spectrum Laboratories, CA, USA; C02-P20U-

129

05) with 0, 1, or 3 ×106 viable cells per device (0M, 1M, 3M, respectively). Excess media flowed through

130

the semi-permeable hollow fibers while cells remained within the extraluminal space of the reactor.

131

Microreactors used were 20 cm long with an internal surface area of 28 cm2. Within each microreactor

132

are nine 0.5 mm diameter fibers comprised of polyethersulfone with a 0.2 μm pore size. The total

133

internal volume of the microreactor is 1.5 mL.

134

Depending on the group, microreactors were either used immediately or incubated at 37℃ for 2 hours

135

to allow for cell attachment and were subsequently held for24 hours at room temperature prior to

136

integration into the circuit. This hold time intends to mimic the time between device manufacture and

137

potential clinical application.

138

Following hold, select MRs were subjected to flushing. Prior to connection to the perfusion circuit sterile

139

saline (4.5 mL) was pushed via syringe through the extracapillary port of the MR. Discharge exited

140

through the intracapillary port.. Samples from the extracapillary space were collected prior to and post

141

flush to measure soluble levels of phosphatidylserine and tissue factor.

142

Large scale bioreactors were used in the animal studies. Similar to the microreactor fill/finish process,

143

following MSC thaw, cell and media suspension was perfused through the extracapillary port onto semi-

144

permeable hollow fibers (Asahi Kasei Medical Inc, IL, USA, OP-05W(A). Cells remained within the

145

extraluminal space of the reactor while excess media perfused through the membranes out the

146

intracapillary port. Thawed vials used in these assays were comprised of cells with a minimum 80%

147

viability. Bioreactors were seeded with either 0, 250, or 750 ×106 viable cells per unit.

Fresh-Frozen Pooled Plasma

150

Fresh-Frozen Pooled Plasma was collected and citrated via FDA licensed blood centers from prescreened

151

healthy donors (Geroge King Bio-Medical, KS, USA). No buffers or stabilizers were added. Plasma was

152

frozen within 30 minutes of collection at -70℃ from a pool of >50 donors per lot. This plasma still

153

contains many essential factors for clot initiation, including prothrombin which can be activated with the

154

addition of calcium via CaCl2 to form firm clots over time. Testing was done to ensure normal values for

155

PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, dRVVT normalized ratio, Factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII.

156
157

Plasma Perfusion

158

After thawing 5 mL of FFPP via water bath (37℃), 50 uL of 1M CaCl2 was added to the plasma within a

159

capped syringe and inverted. The plasma was loaded into prepared perfusion circuits with (0, 1, and

160

3×106 MSCs) and without microreactors via the syringe port and perfused at a flow rate of 1 mL/min for

161

5 minutes. Plasma was then extracted from the circuit via the syringe port, aliquoted into microplate

162

wells and placed within the spectrophotometer (Synergy Mx, BioTek) for reading at 405 nm every 10

163

seconds for a total of 45 minutes.

164

Positive controls of Innovin (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Germany) or Factor IXa (Haematologic

165

Technologies, VT, USA) were used separately, where designated, at 1:50,000. These positive controls

166

were added prior to CaCl2 addition to ensure equal mixing before coagulation initiation. 1M CaCl2 was

167

added at 1:100.

168

Unfractionated heparin (Grifols, Spain) was used at 1.5 U/mL in the designated groups. Heparin was

169

added prior to CaCl2 addition to ensure equal mixing before coagulation initiation.

Clot Formation Time Analysis and Graphing

172

Clot formation time measurements incorporated the sum of two time periods. The first period initiates

173

when plasma has been recalcified through the addition of CaCl2 and continues through perfusion until

174

transfer of the samples into microwells for analysis on the spectrophotometer. This value is immediately

175

recorded by the operator. The second time period occurs when the spectrophotometric readings begin

176

and continues for 45 minutes. At the completion of the study the elapsed time in the first period is

177

added to the time required to obtain the ½ maximal spectrophotometric value, as determined using the

178

clot formation time formula. Combined, these measurements capture the clot formation time.

179

Resulting values were then graphed and statistically analyzed using unpair student’s t-test (GraphPad

180

Software, La Jolla, CA). Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Values of p < 0.05 were

181

considered statistically significant for all analyses.

182
183

Flow cytometry

184

To measure tissue factor by flow cytometry, staining was done using CD142-APC monoclonal antibody

185

(eBiosciences) in a total volume of 100 µL Stain Buffer containing FBS and ≤0.09% sodium azide (BD

186

Biosciences). Samples were incubated for 15 min at 4℃ and analyzed on a FACSCanto II flow cytometer

187

(BD Biosciences) using BD FACSDiva v6.1.1 software. Mouse PE IgG1 kappa isotype antibody

188

(eBioscience) was used as a negative control.

189

Annexin V staining was done using the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BioLegend) according to

190

the manufacturer's instructions. Fresh thawed MSCs were used to optimize fluorescence compensation.

191

Flow cytometry analysis was performed in FlowJo (FlowJo LCC, OR, USA; version 10.7).

Mongrel Dog Perfusion

194

Eighteen male mongrel dogs were randomized onto the study and underwent surgery for placement of

195

a dialysis catheter (Toxikon Corp, Beford MA). Animals received buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg, IM) pre-

196

surgery, PM the day of surgery and AM the day after surgery, and cefazolin (22 mg/kg, IV/IM) pre-

197

surgery, then daily for two additional days post-surgery. After a 2 day wash out period, animals were

198

dosed according to their group assignment with 6 animals assigned to either a 0M, 250M, or 750M MSC

199

dose group. Heparin was administered throughout treatment with all animals first receiving a bolus of

200

heparin at 150 U/kg and then a continuous infusion of 25 U/kg every hour. All animals underwent a 24-

201

hour perfusion (+/- 1 hour), with the exception of animal 1003 (Group 1, Control) which was stopped

202

after 22 hours due to low blood flow rate through the catheter.

204

Porcine Acute Myocardial Infarction Model Perfusion

205

On Day 0, 8 Yorkshire pigs underwent induced myocardial infarction of the anterior/septal left ventricle

206

by 45-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (CBSet Inc., Lexington, MA). After one hour

207

of reperfusion/stabilization, animals were connected to the extracorporeal loop via the jugular vein

208

which enabled whole blood circulation through a large scale bioreactor for a period of up to 12 hours.

209

Bioreactors were seeded with either 0 or 750 million human bone-marrow derived MSCs, 24 hours prior

210

to perfusion (n=4 per group). Heparin was administered throughout the treatment, first as a bolus of

211

225 U/kg and then intermittently to ensure ACTs remained above 300 seconds. Serum troponin levels

212

were assessed at baseline 12 and 24 hours after infarction induction. At 72 hours post injury induction

213

animals were sacrificed with their hearts excised and dyed with Evans Blue and 1% TCC. Infarct area was

214

determined through tracing of digitized images of section via the morphometric software system

215

Olympus cellSens (Version 1.17).

Results

218

Development of an assay to test CFT under perfusion

219

We developed an approach in which we could test human plasma compatibility of allogeneic MSCs

220

across multiple extents of cell exposure. Cryopreserved MSCs could either be injected into the plasma

221

directly after thaw (Fig. 1A), cultured for 24 hours after recovery and then directly injected into plasma

222

(Fig. 1B), or seeded into hollow-fiber microreactors with a semi-permeable membrane, allowed to

223

attach, and held for up to 24 hours before being subjected to perfusion (Fig. 1C). These ranges of

224

administration broadly represent many of the systemic administration options available today and allow

225

the comparison of varying degrees of MSC to plasma exposure and the effects of MSC culture

226

conditions.

227

After perfusion, plasma was collected from the circuit via the syringe port and placed into microwells for

228

spectrophotometric reading over time. The point at which a clot was formed was determined by using

229

the resultant spectrophotometric readout and formula (Fig. 1D, E) to calculate the ½ maximal value, a

230

point previously determined to designate clot formation [34, 35]. Higher values for clot formation times

231

indicate slower clot formation within the plasma.

232
233

Presence of MSCs accelerates CFT

234

Consistent with previous work [12], our fresh-frozen pooled plasma-based (FFPP) clot formation assay

235

showed that the presence of MSCs accelerated clot formation under flow conditions relative to acellular

236

controls (Figure 2). Interestingly, the same experimental setup run with plasma isolated from an

237

individual donor 24 hours after collection instead of FFPP did not result in significantly different clotting

238

times between cellular and acellular groups, likely as it wasn’t frozen directly after being pulled (Figure

239

S1). Spectrophotometric measurements of optical density at 405 nm captured fibrin clot formation as it

240

occurred within the microwell via increases in measured OD over time (Figure 2A). Results from our

241

assays showed that the direct injection (DI) of freshly thawed MSCs into the plasma flow circuit

242

significantly hastened the onset of clot formation when compared to circuits using bioreactor housed

243

MSCs. Both the 1M BM-MSC and 3M BM-MSC direct injection groups induced clot formation during the

244

initial perfusion, prior to spectrophotometric reading. All other groups completed perfusion and

245

spectrophotometric reading (Figure 2B). These findings were consistent across 3 separate MSC donors

246

(Figure S2).

247

Furthermore, MSC dose played a role in clot formation. Increases in the number of cells administered

248

were significantly associated with shorter CFTs across both administration routes. However, when

249

comparing similarly seeded MRs to direct injection with the same number of cells, CFT was significantly

250

slower in the groups where MSCs were housed in the bioreactor (Figure 2B).

251
252

Recovering thawed MSCs prolongs CFT

253

Immobilizing MSCs in the bioreactor allows for cell recovery post-thaw, a process proposed to reduce

254

the surface exposure of pro-coagulation factors [27]. In order to investigate the effect of recovering

255

MSCs on clot formation, two known pro-coagulant factors- tissue factor and phosphatidylserine - were

256

measured prior to perfusion. Flow cytometric analysis of the surface markers on both the freshly thawed

257

and MSCs allowed to recover for 24 hours in culture, showed that cell recovery had significantly lowered

258

the levels of phosphatidylserine and tissue factor (Figure 3A).

O’Rourke et al, Bioreactor Attenuates Clot Formation
259

We next asked whether recovering MSCs post thaw had an effect on clot formation. CFTs were

260

compared between freshly thawed cells (unwashed or washed) and cells recovered for 24 hours. Both

261

unwashed and washed freshly thawed conditions quickly clotted at similar times during perfusion

262

suggesting that washing to remove debris and cryopreservative did not affect clot time. However, CFT

263

was significantly prolonged by allowing for 24 hours of recovery in culture prior to injection (Figure 3B).

264

As levels of MSC surface markers appeared to be correlated with clot initiation, we next asked whether

265

limiting the direct interaction of MSC surface markers and plasma could reduce the rate of clot

266

formation. Interestingly, recovery of MSCs within a microreactor did not significantly affect measured

267

CFTs relative to fully recovered MSCs (Figure 3B). MSCs that were thawed, seeded into MRs, and

268

immediately perfused, clotted at the same time as MSCs that were seeded and allowed to recover for 24

269

hours. These results suggest that though recovery of cells post thaw significantly reduces MSC induced

270

clotting, housing them in an adherent state on the outside of a hollow fiber seems to further, and more

271

significantly, reduce their clotting potential even without any recovery period.

272
273

Removing soluble factors from the MSC reactor prolongs CFT

274

While seeding MSCs on the hollow fiber membrane resulted in prolonged CFT, cellular contribution was

275

still observed as all cellular microreactor circuits clotted in a dose dependent manner (Figure 2B). While

276

in the 24-hour hold period post-attachment, it is likely that MSC derived factors accumulate within the

277

microreactor and may contribute towards clotting. To directly assay this, we integrated a saline flush of

278

the microreactor into our protocol. After the 24-hour hold and just prior to perfusion, MRs were flushed

279

with 3X column volume (4.5 mL) of saline. Samples from the microreactor were collected pre-and post-

280

flush and subjected to flow cytometric analysis for measurement of tissue factor and

the cellular group as expected. Post-flush samples showed clear reductions in both factors,

283

demonstrating that soluble factors can be effectively flushed out of the hollow fiber filter (Figure 4A).

284

Flushing the microreactors significantly prolonged CFT in higher doses (3M), while in lower doses (1M)

285

significance could not be reached. (Figure 4B). These data indicate that soluble factors (e.g.

286

phosphotidylserine) are present in the extracapillary space of the bioreactor and can accumulate to

287

contribute to accelerated clot formation.

Heparin administration prevents MSC induced clotting in vitro

290

Despite significantly reducing the clotting potential of MSCs, bioreactors loaded with the cells at higher

291

doses (3M) still induced earlier clotting when compared to acellular or low-dose (1M) cell bioreactors.

292

Plasma spiked with heparin was used to investigate the potential efficacy of administered

293

anticoagulation in preventing clot formation within the circuitry. Administration of 1.5 U/mL of heparin

294

across all groups was able to completely prevent clot formation, even in the presence of positive control

295

Innovin or 3M directly injected MSCs (Figure 5).

The bioreactor setup can be scaled up with larger filters to allow for perfusion in large animal models.

300

Previous work in in vivo models showed that heparin administration could effectively reduce

301

procoagulant activity of MSCs [35]. To reduce the number of animals used, here we compared only

302

between bioreactor groups, no direct injection animal studies were conducted. We first tested feasibility

303

of perfusion of the device in vivo in a healthy canine model. Animals were all heparinized to assure

304

safety as extracorporeal treatments (even without cells) have intrinsic clotting potential. Dogs were

305

grouped into cohorts based on the number of MSCs loaded into a scaled up bioreactor, with doses of 0

306

million, 250 million, and 750 million (n=6 dogs per group) and perfused for 24 hours. No clotting was

307

seen in any group (data not shown).

308

Next, we asked the question of whether clotting in vivo would be observed under an pathological

309

conditions, such as acute organ failure, where systemic inflammation may perturb the coagulation

310

pathways. For this purpose a porcine animal model of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was used

311

(Figure 6 A). AMI was induced, animals were re-perfused/stabilized for 1 hour and then connected to

312

the bioreactor perfusion circuit for 12 hours. All animals were perfused without events for 12 hours,

313

with each group showing cardiac injury biomarker induction (Figure 6 B) and similar infarct size (Figure 6

314

C). Heparin was administered throughout the perfusion process to maintain a minimum activated

315

clotting time (ACT) of at least 300 seconds (as mandated by IACUC), with neither group requiring

316

significantly more heparin than the other (Figure 6 D, E). These data support the use of MSC bioreactors

317

without additional heparin requirements beyond what is used in acellular extracorporeal treatments.

Discussion

320

In the absence of clear clinical benefit of early allogeneic MSC human trials to meet their therapeutic

321

endpoints, there has been a major focus in recent years to improve the reliability and consistency of the

322

therapeutic cells delivered [40]. Improvements in manufacturing processes, more stringent release

323

testing and biobanking has provided a reproducibility to the cell production that has contributed to a

324

clinically approved therapy [8, 28, 41-43]. However, many cellular concerns still exist, including handling

325

at point of care, thawing, route of delivery, hemocompatibility, and dosing. Our studies here focused on

326

comparing the potential risks of one of those concerns, MSC induced coagulation, between direct

327

infusion and a modified ex vivo, systemic approach.

328

Most commonly, allogeneic MSCs are delivered for therapeutic effect through systemic administration

329

(intravenous or intra-arterial) accounting for about half of all published studies [28]. Systemic

330

introduction has been described as the least invasive, most reproducible, and provides the MSCs the

331

most direct access to modulate systemic inflammation [44]. However, this route of administration may

332

increase risks to certain hypercoagulable patients given that MSCs are known to express coagulation

333

factors both on their cell surface and on the exosomes and vesicles they secrete, namely tissue factor

334

and phosphatidylserine [16, 41, 45]. Further, systemically introduced MSCs can rapidly get trapped in

335

the lungs or be cleared, reducing their potential efficacy [40]. Because of these concerns, where possible

336

and concordant with the mechanism of action (MoA), alternatives to systemic administration are

337

increasingly utilized, including intramuscular infusions, topical, direct tissue injections, and intracoronary

338

delivery. While useful for localized applications including tissue regeneration, these routes of delivery

339

are not used to treat systemic applications such as GvHD, and present limitations of their own in terms

340

of feasibility, reproducibility, and efficacy [46, 47].

341

Here, in concert with the previously mentioned improvements with cellular production, we assayed the

342

value of incorporating an experimental setup which confines MSCs behind the membrane of a hollow-

343

fiber filter. Given that much of the MSCs’ ability to induce clot formation arises from its cell surface

344

markers and secreted vesicles, we considered that the confinement of the cells and their procoagulant

345

expressing surface markers in one extraluminal location may reduce the rate at which clot formation

346

occurs. We used an existing bioreactor platform known to retain MSC immunomodulatory capacity in

347

combination with modifications to an existing clot formation assay to assess cellular effect on CFT in this

348

immobilized state relative to direct injection [32, 34, 35]. Through this platform we perfused citrated,

349

platelet poor fresh-frozen pooled plasma. This plasma contains many essential factors for clot initiation,

350

including prothrombin which can be activated with the addition of calcium via CaCl2 to form firm clots

351

over time.

O’Rourke et al, Bioreactor Attenuates Clot Formation
352

Immediately after CaCl2 addition, this coagulable (but still liquid) plasma is perfused through the hollow-

353

fiber filter platform. As expected, direct injection of MSCs into the coagulable plasma perfusion circuit

354

led to rapid clot formation in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, perfusion of coagulable plasma

355

through bioreactors seeded with MSCs resulted in clotting at rates significantly slower than their

356

comparable direct injection groups, suggesting that free, circulating MSCs increase thrombosis risk more

357

than bioreactor immobilized MSCs. Like the direct injection group, the MSC dose seeded in the

358

bioreactor was predictive of CFT with higher doses inducing quicker clots, likely through the increased

359

production of pro-coagulable MSC factors. It is also important to note that the presence of a filter

360

(acellular microreactor) in the circuit induced clotting faster than a circuit without a microreactor

361

supporting the idea that high surface area biomaterials increase factor adsorption and may contribute

362

to expedited clotting [48]. Alternative approaches such as heparin coating the hollow fiber filters prior

363

to MSC seeding may reduce surface adsorption and adhesion, lowering this inherent clot induction

364

potential [49-51].

365

Historically, failed MSCs trials have been in part attributed to poor cell processing, including delivery of

366

dead and/or coagulable cells [40, 43, 52, 53]. In this study, washing of cells post thaw did not affect CFT

367

significantly. However, recovery of cells for 24 hours post thaw did reduce clot formation potential. This

368

was shown to correlate with surface marker expression of tissue factor and phosphatidylserine. Both

369

decreased following recovery, correlating with a slower clot formation time relative to MSCs directly

370

injected into the circuit post thaw. Recovery culture of cryopreserved MSCs within a microreactor did

371

not have a significant impact on CFT relative to freshly thawed cells within microreactors, suggesting

372

that the MSC confinement by the hollow fiber membrane may actually be playing a role in prolonging

373

CFT. While MSCs located behind the membrane are still able to exchange their immunomodulatory

374

secreted factors with perfusing solutions, they may be sharing less of their cell surface area and may aid

375

in confining their cellular debris to the extracapillary space of the microreactor. Future studies with

376

more restrictive filter sizes may even further limit MSC exposure and further prolong CFT.

377

Having shown that cell presence shortens clot formation time we sought to use the platform to mitigate

378

that effect as much as possible. Since our microreactor is composed of hollow fibers, exchange does

379

happen through the 0.2 μm pores on the fibers in the microreactor. During hold, MSCs continue to

380

produce materials and some of this accumulated material could be contributing to clot formation. To

381

assess this, we developed a flush protocol and measured steep drops in known coagulation markers.

382

Consequently, flushing resulted in slower CFTs at higher MSC doses. Future studies will assay whether

383

flushing also affects immunomodulatory potential relative to unflushed reactors [32].

384

Despite the microreactors measured effect of prolonging CFT, it did not completely abrogate the cellular

385

contribution to shortened CFT. In clinical setting anticoagulation protocols will likely be integrated to

386

ensure designated perfusion times are met. Our in vitro experiments and in vivo canine studies showed

387

that heparin administration could effectively prevent any cellular induced clot formation during

388

perfusion. However, many of the patients suffering from systemic inflammation, including those with

389

COVID-19, present with hypercoagulable plasma that will require anticoagulation prior to MSC

390

administration. Our pig model represented a more physiologically relevant condition in which inflamed

391

animals were perfused with a device scaled for human use. Under these acute injury conditions, no

392

clotting was observed in animals perfused with devices loaded with 750M MSCs and for 12 hours. The

393

lack of additional heparin requirement suggests that patients set to undergo MSC-bioreactor perfusion

394

may not need more heparin than a sham control undergoing the same procedure. Future studies

395

comparing direct infusion of MSCs to bioreactor housed MSCs would be useful to evaluate both for

396

coagulation and efficacy responses.

397

Given the slower CFT in the microreactor groups relative to the direct injection groups, it is possible that

398

a lower dose of heparin could be administered to the microreactor groups. Future dose testing will be

399

required to verify this. Such a finding would be clinically relevant, as reduction in the amount of heparin

400

required to be delivered to critically ill patients may help prevent unintended health consequences.

401

Further, patients which are medically restricted from systemic heparin administration for risk of internal

402

bleeding could potentially be anticoagulated regionally with citrate. Citrate could be introduced and

403

equilibrated within the MSC bioreactor circuit, allowing MSC factors to be released but without exposing

404

patients to the anticoagulant [54].

405

In the unfortunate circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in MSC based therapies has

406

increased markedly. Case reports, first from China and then worldwide, showed promising

407

improvements in patient health following intravenous MSC infusion, even in severely ill patients [10, 55,

408

56]. While larger studies are now needed to more completely support these findings, it is clear that

409

intravenous infusion of MSCs for systemic inflammatory conditions such as COVID-19 infection or GvHD

410

continues to have therapeutic potential. Remestemcel-L, an ex-vivo culture-expanded adult human MSC

411

suspension for intravenous infusion, which has received positive recommendations from the FDA for

412

steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease in pediatric patients based on an open-label study

413

compared to historical controls [57]. The novel delivery approach described here could potentially

414

reduce risk of clot formation from IV administered MSCs, making treatment potentially safer and more

415

controlled than direct infusion.

416

Conclusion

417

We conclude that immobilization of MSCs in a hollow fiber filter contributes to a reduced clot initiation

418

potential relative to directly injected MSCs. Further removal of cellular byproducts through saline

419

flushing of the bioreactor further reduces the MSC based clot formation potential. Additional heparin

does not appear to be required to maintain a designated ACT value relative to acellular perfusion

421

circuits. Taken together, combined integration of these approaches may make MSC therapies which

422

require systemic MSC exposure at less risk for coagulation-related events for a larger population,

423

including the hypercoagulable.

Figure 1. Clot Formation Assay Experimental Setup. MSCs were thawed from cryopreservation and
were either (A) immediately combined into fresh-frozen pooled plasma-based (FFPP), perfused in the
circuit and read, (B) cultured for 24 hours then resuspended into FFPP, perfused in the circuit and read,
or (C) seeded into micro bioreactors (MR), allowed to attach to the hollow-fiber filters for 2 hours, room
temperature incubated for 24 hours then attached to perfusion circuits loaded with FFPP, perfused and
read. Perfusion of the MR circuits lasted 5 minutes before samples were collected and read on the
spectrophotometer at 405nm to assess fibrin formation. (D) Resulting spectrophotometric optical density
(OD) readouts were graphed over time. (E) Formula used for the calculation of the clot formation time
determined at the ½ maximal value.

Figure 2. Increased MSC Exposure Shortens Clot Formation Time. 0, 1 x 10 , or 3 x 10 viable MSCs were
isolated for inclusion in each respective group. Freshly thawed MSCs were used in direct injection (DI) groups.
MSCs used in MR groups were first incubated for 2 hours at 37 °C followed by a 24 hour hold at room
temperature prior to perfusion. After each groups’ cells were prepared warmed fresh frozen pooled plasma
was perfused through circuit for 5 minutes then subjected to spectrophotometric measurements. (A)
Measurements of fibrin clot formation in plasma were made every 10 seconds over a 45-minute period (grey
shaded region) following 5 minutes of perfusion (aqua shaded region). Groups which clotted during perfusion
are designated with an ‘x’ at the time at which the clot was noted to be visibly obstructing perfusion. As clots
formed, absorbance increased resulting in the designated curves. (B) Values for CFT were determined.
Resulting values were graphed and analyzed with an unpaired student’s t-test. N=3 runs per group.

Figure 3. The Effect of Cell Washing and Cell Recovery on CFT. 1 x 10 viable MSCs were isolated for inclusion
in each respective group. Recovered cells were cultured for 24 hours and dissociated from the culture plate
immediately prior to use. (A) Cells collected immediately after thaw and cells collected after recovery were
subjected to staining and flow cytometry. Each curve represents the outcome of 3 pooled samples. (B) Direct
injection groups were either thawed directly into plasma, washed with saline, or recovered with 24 hrs of
culture at 37 °C. Microreactor groups were seeded with MSCs and either immediately used or allowed to
attach for 2 hours at 37 °C followed by a 24 hour hold at room temperature prior to perfusion. Values for CFT
were determined and resulting values were graphed and analyzed with an unpaired student’s t-test. N=3
runs per group. ****= p< 0.0001. Error bars represent ± standard deviation.

fresh frozen pooled plasma was perfused through circuits with either 0, 1 or 3 x 10 viable MSCs (with and
without a flushing procedure) for 5 minutes then subjected to spectrophotometric measurements.
Measurements of fibrin clot formation in plasma were then made every 10 seconds over a 45-minute period.
Values for CFT were determined and values were graphed and analyzed with an unpaired student’s t-test.

Figure 5. Effect of Heparin on CFT. 0, 1 x 10 , or 3 x 10 (0M, 1M, 3M) viable MSCs were isolated for inclusion
in each respective group. MSCs for direct injection groups were thawed directly into plasma then used, while
microreactor groups were seeded with MSCs and allowed to attach for 2 hours at 37 °C followed by a 24 hour
hold at room temperature prior to perfusion. Innovin (thromboplastin) was added to the 0M group as a
positive control. After each groups’ cells were prepared, warmed FFPP was perfused through circuit for 5
minutes then subjected to spectrophotometric measurements. Measurements of fibrin clot formation in
plasma were made every 10 seconds over a 45-minute period. Values for CFT were determined and resulting
values were graphed and analyzed with an unpaired student’s t-test. Samples which showed no increase in
absorbance through the course of the experiment were designated to have not clotted. N≥2 runs per group.
