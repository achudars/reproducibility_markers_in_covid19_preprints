Abstract

23

The COVID-19 pandemic has spread to almost every country in the world since it started

24

in China in late 2019. Controlling the pandemic requires a multifaceted approach

25

including whole genome sequencing to support public health interventions at local and

26

national levels. One of the most widely used methods for sequencing is the ARTIC

27

protocol, a tiling PCR approach followed by Oxford Nanopore sequencing (ONT) of up

28

to 96 samples at a time. There is a need, however, for a flexible, platform agnostic,

29

method that can provide multiple throughput options depending on changing

30

requirements as the pandemic peaks and troughs. Here we present CoronaHiT, a method

31

capable of multiplexing up to 96 small genomes on a single MinION flowcell or >384

32

genomes on Illumina NextSeq, using transposase mediated addition of adapters and PCR

33

based addition of barcodes to ARTIC PCR products. We demonstrate the method by

34

sequencing 95 and 59 SARS-CoV-2 genomes for routine and rapid outbreak response

35

runs, respectively, on Nanopore and Illumina platforms and compare to the standard

36

ARTIC LoCost nanopore method. Of the 154 samples sequenced using the three

37

approaches, genomes with ≥ 90% coverage (GISAID criteria) were generated for 64.3%

38

of samples for ARTIC LoCost, 71.4% for CoronaHiT-ONT, and 76.6% for CoronaHiT-

39

Illumina and have almost identical clustering on a maximum likelihood tree. In

40

conclusion, we demonstrate that CoronaHiT can multiplex up to 96 SARS-CoV-2

41

genomes per MinION flowcell and that Illumina sequencing can be performed on the

42

same libraries, which will allow significantly higher throughput. CoronaHiT provides

43

increased coverage for higher Ct samples, thereby increasing the number of high quality

genomes that pass the GISAID QC threshold. This protocol will aid the rapid expansion

45

of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing globally, to help control the pandemic.

Introduction

47

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus began late 2019 in Wuhan,

48

China and has now spread to virtually every country in the world, with tens of millions of

49

confirmed cases and millions of deaths (Dong, Du, and Gardner 2020). Key to the control

50

of the pandemic is understanding the epidemiological spread of the virus at global,

51

national and local scales (Shu and McCauley 2017). Whole genome sequencing of

52

SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be the fastest and most accurate method to study virus

53

epidemiology as it spreads. We are sequencing SARS-CoV-2 as part of the COVID-19

54

Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium, a network of academic and public health

55

institutions across the UK brought together to collect, sequence and analyse whole

56

genomes to fully understand the transmission and evolution of this virus

57

(https://www.cogconsortium.uk/). The SARS-CoV-2 genome was first sequenced in

58

China using a metatranscriptomic approach (Wu et al. 2020). This facilitated the design

59

of tiling PCR approaches for genome sequencing, the most widely used of which is the

60

ARTIC Network (https://artic.network) protocol. Consensus genome sequences are

61

typically made publicly available on GISAID (Elbe and BucklandMerrett 2017). This

62

has enabled real-time public health surveillance of the spread and evolution of the

63

pandemic through interactive tools such as NextStrain (Hadfield et al. 2018). The ARTIC

64

network protocol was designed for nanopore technology (Oxford Nanopore

65

Technologies), enabling rapid genome sequencing for outbreak response. The method

66

was originally capable of testing only 23 samples plus a negative control on a flowcell,

67

however, with the recent release of the Native Barcoding Expansion 96 kit by ONT, 11-

68

95 samples plus a negative control can be sequenced on a flowcell using the ARTIC

69

LoCost V3 method (Quick, 2020). A platform agnostic method is required to provide

70

flexible throughput on Illumina or nanopore that allows low-cost sequencing of 10s to

71

100s of viral genomes depending on (1) changing requirements as the pandemic peaks

72

and troughs and (2) the turnaround time required e.g. routine weekly vs rapid outbreak

73

sequencing. Here we describe a flexible protocol, Coronavirus High Throughput

74

(CoronaHiT), which allows for up to 95 samples, plus a negative control to be

75

multiplexed on a single MinION flowcell or alternatively, by switching barcodes, over

76

384 samples on Illumina. We demonstrate CoronaHiT’s performance on 95 and 59

77

SARS-CoV-2 genomes on MinION and Illumina NextSeq for routine and rapid outbreak

78

response runs, respectively, and compare to the ARTIC LoCost protocol.

128

The lower of the cycle thresholds (Ct) produced by the two SARS-CoV-2 assays in the

129

Roche, AusDiagnostics, Altona Diagnostics and CDC assays were used to determine

130

whether samples required dilution before sequencing according to the ARTIC protocol.

131

The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay on the Hologic Panther System does not provide a Ct

132

value but rather a combined fluorescence signal for both targets in relative light units

133

(RLUs), therefore all samples tested by the Hologic Panther were processed undiluted in

134

the ARTIC protocol.

ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 multiplex tiling PCR

137

cDNA and multiplex PCR reactions were prepared following the ARTIC nCoV-2019

138

sequencing protocol V3 (LoCost) (Quick, 2020). Dilutions of RNA were prepared when

139

required based on Ct values following the guidelines from the ARTIC protocol.

140

V3 CoV-2 primer scheme (https://github.com/artic-network/artic-

ncov2019/tree/master/primer_schemes/nCoV-2019/V3) were used to perform the

142

multiplex PCR for SARS-CoV-2 according to the ARTIC protocol (Quick, 2020). For the

143

ARTIC multiplex PCR, 65°C was chosen as the annealing/extension temperature, and

144

due to variable Ct values, all samples were run for 35 cycles in the two multiplex PCRs.

Libraries were prepared using a novel modified Illumina DNA prep tagmentation

148

approach (formerly called Nextera DNA Flex Illumina Library Prep) (Rowan et al. 2019;

149

Beier et al. 2017). Primers with a 3’ end compatible with the Nextera transposon insert

150

and a 24bp barcode at the 5’ end with a 7 bp spacer were used to PCR barcode the

151

tagmented ARTIC PCR products. The barcode sequences are from the PCR Barcoding

152

Expansion 1-96 kit (EXP-PBC096, Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Symmetrical dual

153

barcoding was used, i.e. the same barcode added at each end of the PCR product and up

154

to 96 samples could be run together using this approach or 95 if a negative control is

155

included (Supplementary Table 4).

156

ARTIC PCR products were diluted 1:5 (2.5 µl Pool 1, 2.5 µl Pool 2 and 20 µl PCR grade

157

water). Tagmentation was performed as follows; 0.5 µl TB1 Tagmentation Buffer 1 , 0.5

158

µl BLT Bead-Linked Transposase (both contained in Illumina® DNA Prep, (M)

159

Tagmentation Catalogue No 20018704) and 4 µl PCR grade water was made as a master

160

mix scaled to sample number. On ice, 5 µl of tagmentation mix was added to each well of

161

a chilled 96-well plate. Next, 2 µl of diluted PCR product was pipette mixed with the 5 µl

162

tagmentation mix. This plate was sealed and briefly centrifuged before incubation at

163

55°C for 15 minutes in a thermal cycler (heated lid 65°C) and held at 10°C.

164

PCR barcoding was performed using Kapa 2G Robust PCR kit (Sigma Catalogue No.

165

KK5005) as follows: 4 µl Reaction buffer (GC), 0.4 µl dNTP’s, 0.08 µl Kapa 2G Robust

166

Polymerase and 7.52 µl PCR grade water per sample were mixed and 12 µl was added to

167

each well in a new 96-well plate. 1 µl of the appropriate barcode pair (Supplementary

168

added, making sure to transfer all the beads. PCR reactions were run at 72°C for 3

170

minutes, 95°C for 1 minute, followed by 14 cycles of 95°C for 10 seconds, 55°C for 20

171

seconds and 72°C for 1 minute. Following PCR, 2 µl of each sample was pooled and 40

172

µl of this pool was bead washed with 36 µl (0.8X) AMPure XP beads (2 washes in 200μl

173

70% ethanol) for the routine samples. For the rapid response run, 100 µl of the pool was

174

washed with 60 µl (0.6X) AMPure XP. Pools were eluted in 20 µl of EB (Qiagen

175

Catalogue No. 19086). The barcoded pool was quantified using Qubit High Sensitivity kit

176

(Catalogue No. Q32851).

177

A nanopore sequencing library was then made, largely following the SQK-LSK109

178

protocol. The end-prep reaction was prepared as follows: 7 µl Ultra II end prep buffer, 3

179

µl Ultra II end prep enzyme mix, 40 µl nuclease free water and 10 µl of washed barcoded

180

pool from the previous step (final volume 60 µl). The reaction was incubated at room

181

temperature for 15 mins and 65°C for 10 mins, followed by a hold at 4°C for at least 1

182

min. This was bead-washed using 60 µl of AMPure Beads (1X) and two 200μl 70%

183

ethanol washes and eluted in 61 µl nuclease free water. The end-prepped DNA was taken

184

forward to the adapter ligation as follows: 30 µl end-prepped pool from previous step

185

(~60 ng), 30 µl nuclease free water, 25 µl LNB (ONT), 10 µl NEBNext Quick T4 Ligase

186

and 5 µl AMX (ONT) was mixed and incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes.

187

After the incubation, the full volume was washed with 40 µl AMPure XP beads and 2

188

consecutive 250 µl SFB (ONT) washes with resuspension of beads both times and this

189

was eluted in 15 µl of EB (ONT). The final library was quantified with Qubit High

194

PCR products were tagmented and barcoded as described for the CoronaHiT-ONT library

196

up to 384 combinations, Illumina Catalogue No’s FC-131-2001, FC-131-2002, FC-131-

197

2003 and FC-131-2004). The PCR master mix was adjusted and water removed to add 2

198

µl each of the P7 and P5 primers. Five microliters of each barcoded sample was pooled

199

(without quantification) and 100 µl of the library pool was size selected with 0.8X

200

AMPure XP beads (80 µl), with final elution in 50 µl EB (10mM Tris-HCl). The

201

barcoded pool was sized on a Agilent Tapestation D5000 tape and quantified using

202

QuantiFluor® ONE dsDNA System (Promega, WI, USA) and the molarity calculated.

ARTIC LoCost protocol Nanopore library preparation

210

After ARTIC multiplex PCR, library preparation was performed using the nCoV-2019

211

sequencing protocol v3 (LoCost) V3 (Quick, 2020). Briefly, PCR Pool 1 and 2 were

212

pooled for each sample and diluted 1 in 10 (2.5 µl Pool 1, 2.5 µl Pool 2 and 45 µl

213

nuclease free water), and end-prepped as follows: 1.2 µl Ultra II end prep buffer, 0.5 µl

214

Ultra II end prep enzyme mix, 3.3 µl PCR dilution from previous step and 5 µl nuclease

215

free water (final volume 15 µl). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 15

216

min and 65°C in a thermocycler for 15 min and incubated on ice for 1 min. Native

217

barcode ligation was prepared in a new plate: 0.75 µl end-prepped DNA, 1.25 µl native

218

barcode, 5 µl Blunt/TA Ligase Master Mix, 3 µl nuclease free water, (final volume 10

219

µl). The reaction was incubated at room temperature 20 min and 65°C in a thermocycler

220

for 10 min and incubated on ice for 1 min. Amplicons were pooled together (2 µl for 95

221

samples and 5 µl for 59 samples) and underwent a 0.4X AMPure bead wash with two 250

222

µl SFB washes and one 70% ethanol wash. DNA was eluted in 30 µl of Qiagen EB.

223

Adapter ligation was performed on the full volume (30 µl barcoded amplicon pool, 5 µl

224

Adapter Mix II (ONT), 10 µl NEBNext Quick Ligation Reaction Buffer (5X), 5 µl Quick

225

T4 DNA Ligase). The ligation reaction was incubated at room temperature for 20 min

226

and 1X bead washed (50 µl AMPure XP beads) with 250 µl SFB two times. The library

227

was eluted in 15 µl of elution buffer (ONT) and quantified. 15 ng of the adapted library

228

was used for final loading.

Nanopore sequence analysis

231

Basecalling was performed using Guppy v.4.2.2 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) in high

232

accuracy mode (model dna_r9.4.1_450bps_hac), on a private OpenStack cloud at

233

Quadram Institute Bioscience using multiple Ubuntu v18.04 virtual machines running

234

Nvidia T4 GPU.

235
236

The CoronaHiT-ONT sequencing data were demultiplexed using guppy_barcoder

237

(v4.2.2) with a custom arrangement of the barcodes as described at

238

https://github.com/quadram-institute-bioscience/coronahit_guppy, with the option

239

‘require_barcodes_both_ends’ and a score of 60 at both ends to produce 95 FASTQ files

240

(94 SARS-CoV-2 samples and 1 negative control) and 61 FASTQ files (59 SARS-CoV-2

241

samples and 2 negative control) for the routine and rapid response runs, respectively. The

242

ARTIC ONT sequencing data were demultiplexed using guppy_barcoder (v4.2.2) with

243

the option ‘require_barcodes_both_ends’ and a score of 60 at both ends to produce 95

The downstream analysis was performed using a copy of the ARTIC pipeline (v1.1.3) as

249

previously described (Loman, Rowe, and Rambaut 2020) to generate a consensus

250

sequence for each sample in FASTA format. The pipeline includes the following main

253

using minimap2 (v 2.17-r941). The mapped bases in BAM format were trimmed off in

254

primer regions by the ARTIC subcommand align_trim for ARTIC LoCost data. For

255

CoronaHiT-ONT data, we used the subcommand samtools ampliconclip (v 1.11) at the

256

primer trimming step (https://github.com/quadram-institute-

257

bioscience/fieldbioinformatics/tree/coronahit). The trimmed reads were then used for

258

variant calling with medaka (v 1.2.0) and longshot (v 0.4.1). The final consensus was

259

generated from a filtered VCF file and a mask file of positions with either a depth of

260

coverage lower than 20 or a SNP in an amplifying primer site. The consensus sequences

261

were uploaded to GISAID and the raw sequence data was uploaded to the European

262

Nucleotide Archive under BioProject PRJEB41737. The accession numbers for each

263

sample are available in Supplementary Table 1. The metrics and results of all

experiments are available in Supplementary Table 2 and are summarised in Table 1.

(https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore), were aligned to the Wuhan-Hu-1

278

reference genome (accession MN908947.3) using BWA-MEM (v0.7.17) (Li 2013), the

279

ARTIC amplicons were trimmed and a consensus built using iVAR (v.1.2.3) (Grubaugh

282

Quality Control

283

The COG-UK consortium defined a consensus sequence as passing COG-UK quality

284

control if greater than 50% of the genome was covered by confident calls or there was at

285

least 1 contiguous sequence of more than 10,000 bases and with no evidence of

286

contamination. This is regarded as the minimum amount of data to be phylogenetically

287

useful. A confident call was defined as having a minimum of 10X depth of coverage for

288

Illumina data and 20X depth of coverage for Nanopore data. If the coverage fell below

289

these thresholds, the bases were masked with Ns. Low quality variants were also masked

290

with Ns. The QC threshold for inclusion in GISAID was higher, requiring that greater

291

than 90% of the genome was covered by confident calls with no evidence of

292

contamination.

294

Phylogenetic analysis

295

For each sample sequenced in 3 separate experiments (CoronaHiT-ONT, CoronaHiT-

296

Illumina, ARTIC-ONT), a phylogeny was generated from all of the consensus genomes

297

(n=216 for the routine samples and n=132 for the rapid response samples) passing

298

GISAID QC over all experiments (n=72 out of 95, and n=44 out of 59). A multiple

299

FASTA alignment was created by aligning all samples to the reference genome

300

MN908947.3 with MAFFT v7.470. A maximum likelihood tree was estimated with

301

IQTREE2 (v2.0.4) (Minh et al. 2020) under the HKY model (Hasegawa, Kishino, and

302

Yano 1985), collapsing branches smaller than 10-7 into a polytomy. SNPs in the multiple

303

FASTA alignment were identified using SNP-sites (v2.5.1) (Page et al. 2016) and the tree

304

was visualised with FigTree (v1.4.4) (https://github.com/rambaut/figtree).

305

306

Results

307

A novel library preparation method, CoronaHiT, was developed for SARS-CoV-2

308

genome sequencing, which combines a cheap transposase-based introduction of adapters

309

(Illumina Nextera) with symmetric PCR barcoding of up to 96 samples (or 95 samples

310

with a negative control) on a MinION. Alternatively, if higher throughput is needed, the

311

barcodes can be switched for Illumina sequencing. For ONT sequencing, Nextera adapter

312

complementary primer sequences were added to ONT PCR barcodes and used to barcode

313

ARTIC PCR products (Figure 1) as described in the methods. For Illumina sequencing,

314

the method is a streamlined and cheaper version of standard Illumina library preparations.

315

CoronaHiT does not require individual sample washes and allows samples to be

316

processed uniformly without quantification or normalisation as with the ARTIC LoCost

317

method.

318
319

The CoronaHiT method was tested by multiplexing 95 SARS-CoV-2 routine COG-UK

320

samples plus a blank (hereinafter referred to as the Routine Samples) on a MinION

321

flowcell and on an Illumina NextSeq run. Another 59 samples, including 18 query

322

outbreak samples, plus blanks (hereinafter referred to as the Rapid Response samples)

323

were rapidly sequenced (within 24 hrs of receipt, with results available the following day)

324

on a second flowcell, as well as on Illumina NextSeq. All samples were also sequenced

325

using the ARTIC LoCost library preparation protocol on the MinION for comparison.

326

For the routine samples, 30 hours of sequencing data was used for both CoronaHiT-ONT

327

and ARTIC LoCost, and for the rapid response set, 18 hours was used; the full dataset

328

was used for both CoronaHiT-Illumina runs. The different methods produced different

329

amounts of demultiplexed data. For the routine samples, CoronaHiT-ONT yielded 9.6

330

Gbases of sequence data, ARTIC LoCost sequencing produced 8.0 Gbases of data, and

331

CoronaHiT-Illumina yielded 15.7 Gbases giving on average 1145X, 1719X and 4649X

332

coverage per sample (Table 1). For the rapid response dataset, CoronaHiT-ONT

333

produced 5.7 Gbases, ARTIC LoCost 4.5 Gbases, and CoronaHiT-Illumina 7.3 Gbases

334

resulting in 1104X, 1421X, and 3010X coverage per sample respectively. Both

335

CoronaHiT-ONT runs had less variation in coverage between samples compared to the

336

ARTIC LoCost runs, with lower standard deviation relative to the mean (Table 1). The

337

lower coverage for CoronaHiT-ONT compared to ARTIC is related to the shorter read

338

lengths and the increased proportion of barcode/adapter sequence in each read and,

339

hence, the reduced mappable region of each read.

340
341

Taking all the genomes which passed COG-UK QC, the CoronaHiT-Illumina sequencing

342

runs produced the shortest mappable mean read length at 135 and 131 bases for the

343

routine samples and rapid response samples respectively, just short of the maximum 150

344

bases for the PE 151 chemistry; ARTIC LoCost produced 386 and 384 bases, and

345

CoronaHiT-ONT sequencing produced mappable mean read lengths of 205 and 241

346

bases. The shorter read lengths for CoronaHiT are related to the use of bead-linked

347

transposases for tagmentation, resulting in the removal of the ends of the ARTIC PCR

348

products. The introduction of a 0.6X bead wash for the rapid response CoronaHiT-ONT

349

run (instead of the 0.8X bead wash for the routine run) resulted in the longer mapped

350

reads and contributed to a reduction in the difference in average coverage between

351

CoronaHiT and ARTIC (from 1145x vs 1719x in routine run dropping to 1104X vs

352

1421X in the rapid response run, with similar ratios of raw data produced by the methods

353

in the two runs).

354
355

The demultiplexing steps for CoronaHiT-ONT were different from those used for ARTIC

356

ONT sequencing as described in the methods section. Comparing the nanopore

357

sequencing methods for the routine samples, 74.7% and 81.9% of reads were

358

demultiplexed successfully for CoronaHiT-ONT and ARTIC LoCost respectively when

359

only reads with a PHRED (quality) score above Q7 are considered; for the rapid response

360

set, 69.6% and 71.6% were demultiplexed for CoronaHiT-ONT and ARTIC LoCost. The

361

rest of the reads were unassigned, due to an inability to detect the barcode sequences at

362

both ends of the reads. The negative controls contained zero mapping reads to SARS-

363

CoV-2 for all nanopore datasets. The Illumina routine dataset had mapped reads,

364

however, the vast majority were primers dimers (range of 0-4 SARS-CoV-2 reads >40bp

365

mapped out of the 3 negative controls).

366
367

Poor quality consensus genomes were generally associated with a lower SARS-CoV-2

368

viral load in the clinical samples i.e. higher RT-qPCR Ct values (generally above Ct 32)

369

were more likely to fail COG-UK and GISAID quality control thresholds. For all

370

methods the number of Ns increased significantly in samples with a Ct above 32, which

371

equates to approx 100 viral genome copies in the PCR reaction (Figure 2).

372

Supplementary Figures 1a-f show the Ns (missing or masked bases) within the consensus

373

genomes - the three ARTIC PCR primer dropout areas (Benjamin Farr et al. 2020) are

374

clearly visible. Comparing the routine samples with a Ct of 32 or below (n=65; Cts for

375

most rapid response samples were unknown), the mean (median) number of Ns was 815

376

(121) for ARTIC LoCost, 111 (47) for CoronaHiT-Illumina, and 682 (339) for

377

CoronaHiT-ONT. If all samples are included for the routine set (including higher Ct

378

samples) then the number of Ns increases substantially to a mean (median) of 1635 (121)

379

bases for ARTIC LoCost, 688 (53) for CoronaHiT-Illumina and 1504 (359) for

380

CoronaHiT-ONT.

381
382

384

LoCost, and 48 for both CoronaHiT-ONT and CoronaHiT-Illumina in the rapid response

385

set. The stricter GISAID QC criteria reduces the number of samples passing QC, with the

386

CoronaHiT method outperforming ARTIC LoCost. For the routine samples, 59 samples

387

passed for ARTIC LoCost, 66 passed for CoronaHiT-ONT and 74 passed for CoronaHiT-

388

Illumina and for the rapid response set 40 passed for ARTIC LoCost, and 44 passed for

389

both CoronaHiT-ONT and CoronaHiT-Illumina. Overall, the pass rate was 64.3% for

390

ARTIC LoCost, 71.4% for CoronaHiT-ONT and 76.6% for CoronaHiT-Illumina. When

391

considering higher viral load samples with a known Ct of 32 or below, the pass rate for

392

both GISAID and COG-UK QC was higher, with 89.2% passing for ARTIC LoCost and

393

95.2% and 97.6% passing for CoronaHiT-ONT and CoronaHiT-Illumina, respectively

394

(full details are shown in Table 2). CoronaHiT-ONT had a higher pass rate compared to

395

ARTIC LoCost even though the average coverage was lower, this related to more even

396

coverage across samples on the flowcell (lower standard deviation between samples

397

relative to the mean - Table 1).

398
399

To assess the impact of data quality differences on clustering of lineages, we built

400

maximum likelihood trees for both the routine and rapid response runs with each of the

401

72 and 44 consensus genomes that passed QC from the ARTIC LoCost, CoronaHiT-ONT

402

and CoronaHiT-Illumina sequencing experiments. When the consensus genomes were

403

placed on a phylogenetic tree for the routine set, CoronaHiT-Illumina, ARTIC LoCost,

404

CoronaHiT-ONT showed the same clustering for most samples, except for three cases

405

(EB1DB, EC741 and EC644) where we note that their ARTIC LoCost consensus show

406

an increased number of ambiguous bases. All variant differences between the samples are

407

noted in Supplementary Table 3, together with the sequence length (discounting

408

ambiguous bases whenever there is a difference). Out of all samples in both datasets,

409

there were only two SNP discrepancies, one in sample F04F8 between CoronaHiT-ONT

410

and CoronaHiT-Illumina, with ARTIC LoCost calling the SNP ambiguous, and in sample

411

F0A23 with CoronaHiT-ONT disagreeing with the other methods (Supplementary Table

412

3). The SNP differences did not affect the classification (i.e. closest sequence in the

413

database), and there were no SNP differences between ARTIC-ONT and CoronaHiT-

414

Illumina. The main other source of variation between the samples is that the Illumina

415

genomes allow IUPAC (IUPAC-IUB Comm. on Biochem. Nomenclature (CBN) 1970)

416

symbols for “partially” ambiguous bases. These data show that CoronaHiT provides

417

highly accurate lineage calling compared to ARTIC LoCost.

418
419

The average number of SNPs between the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome and the

420

consensus genomes varied between 7.99 SNPs for and 11.00 SNPs for the routine

421

samples, and 18.2 and 20.4 SNPs for the rapid response samples across all methods (see

422

Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2). The mean number of SNPs in CoronaHiT-Illumina

423

was higher compared to the two ONT sequencing methods (Table 2) due to ambiguous

424

bases in the Illumina dataset being regarded as SNPs in these calculations (Table 2).

425
426

The reagent cost per sample for CoronaHiT-ONT was £8.46 when sequencing 95

427

samples and a negative control on a MinION flowcell, marginally cheaper but similar to

428

ARTIC sequencing at £9.75 per sample (cost breakdown in Supplementary Table 5). If

Discussion

433

Rapid viral genome sequencing during outbreaks is changing how we study disease

434

epidemiology (Kafetzopoulou et al. 2019; Joshua Quick et al. 2016). The recent SARS-

435

CoV-2 global pandemic has again highlighted the use of sequencing in the control of the

436

spread of the disease. Nanopore technology is particularly suited to outbreak sequencing

437

as it is portable, does not require expensive machinery and is accessible throughout the

438

world (Faria et al. 2016). We present a novel platform agnostic method, CoronaHiT, for

439

flexible throughput, cost effective and low complexity sequencing of SARS-CoV-2

440

genomes to respond to the pandemic at the local and national level.

441
442

The ARTIC LoCost protocol (Quick, 2020) has been widely adopted for SARS-CoV-2

443

genome sequencing and allows up to 95 samples (plus a negative control) to be

444

sequenced at a time on a MinION. CoronaHiT is just as cheap, simple and fast, but the

445

combination of transposase introduction of adapters with PCR based barcoding allows for

446

more even coverage between multiplexed samples, resulting in a higher proportion of

447

samples passing QC. It is also designed to be platform agnostic, simply switching

448

barcodes to move to Illumina. This allows the user to flexibly sequence low or high

449

throughput depending on rapidly changing requirements in the pandemic (Bayliss et al.

450

2017; Josh Quick 2020). With the use of asymmetric barcode primers described in Perez21

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.24.162156; this version posted January 11, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

451

Sepulveda et al. 2020, it is possible to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at very high throughput on

452

Illumina; in fact we have recently sequenced over 1000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes on a

453

single Illumina NextSeq High Output run using this approach (data not shown). The

454

CoronaHiT-Illumina library preparation method is cheaper (reduced reaction volumes)

455

and significantly more streamlined (no sample washing or quantification before pooling,

456

no use of stop solution, no clean-up after tagmentation and no clean-up of barcoded PCR

457

products) than standard Illumina library preparation.

458
459

Tiling PCR approaches, such as ARTIC, are prone to high genome coverage variation

460

due to variable primer efficiency in multiplex reactions. Some regions of the SARS-CoV-

461

2 genome have hundreds of times higher coverage than adjacent regions using ARTIC,

462

therefore average coverage of at least 1000X is required to obtain at least 20X coverage

463

of the difficult regions of the genome. We demonstrate that we can achieve >1000X

464

SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage in ~20 minutes per sample using CoronaHiT-ONT on

465

MinION, with a full set of 95 samples taking ~30 hours). While the CoronaHiT-ONT

466

runs described here are very consistent, sequencing yield depends on flowcell quality. We

467

recommend aiming for at least 100 Mbases of estimated sequencing yield per sample to

468

provide sufficient data for >1000X coverage/sample (average across flowcell) using

469

CoronaHiT-ONT.

470
471

Results demonstrate that all methods are unreliable at producing high quality consensus

472

genomes from positive clinical samples with diagnostic RT-qPCR Cts above 32 (approx.

473

100 viral genome copies), however, CoronaHiT performs better in these samples (Figure
22

474

2), producing fewer Ns, likely due to the additional rounds of PCR during barcoding.

475

Below or equal to Ct 32, CoronaHiT-ONT, CoronaHiT-Illumina and ARTIC LoCost

476

produce similar results. While more samples pass both QC measures with CoronaHiT-

477

ONT and CoronaHiT-Illumina compared to ARTIC LoCost, primer dropout regions can

478

be more pronounced in these methods (Supplementary Figure 1). For higher quality

479

consensus genomes, sequencing may be run for longer. Additionally, a reduction in

480

ARTIC PCR annealing temperature from 65°C to 63°C may help improve coverage

481

across these regions (Benjamin Farr et al. 2020). However, data produced from

482

CoronaHiT was sufficient to provide accurate consensus genomes that result in the same

483

lineages and on the same branches on the phylogenetic tree as ARTIC LoCost (Figure 3).

484

Therefore, we have demonstrated high quality, multiplexed SARS-CoV-2 genome

485

sequencing of 95 samples on a single flowcell. If the ARTIC PCR step is optimised to

486

even the coverage of the amplicons (as demonstrated in the Sanger COVID-19 ARTIC

487

Illumina protocol (Benjamin Farr et al. 2020)), less overall coverage will be required per

488

genome and more samples can be multiplexed using all methods.

489
490

In conclusion, we demonstrate that CoronaHiT can be used to sequence 96 SARS-CoV-2

491

samples on a single MinION flowcell, with the option of higher throughput on Illumina.

492

This platform agnostic method is simple, rapid and cheap and results in more samples

493

passing QC than ARTIC LoCost while providing almost identical phylogenetic results.

494

CoronaHiT can help scientists around the world sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes with

495

highly flexible throughput, thereby increasing our understanding, and reducing the

496

spread, of the pandemic.
