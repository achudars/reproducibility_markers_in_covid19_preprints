ABSTRACT
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters human cells upon
binding of its spike (S) glycoproteins to ACE2 receptors. Several nanobodies neutralize SARSCoV-2 infection by binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein, but the
underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, we identified an extended network of
pairwise interactions between RBD and nanobodies H11-H4, H11-D4, and Ty1 by performing
all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Simulations of the nanobody-RBD-ACE2
complex revealed that H11-H4 more strongly binds to RBD without overlapping with ACE2 and
triggers dissociation of ACE2 due to electrostatic repulsion. In comparison, Ty1 binding results
in dissociation of ACE2 from RBD due to an overlap with the ACE2 binding site, whereas H11D4 binding does not trigger ACE2 dissociation. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V1 and
501.V2 variants resulted in a negligible effect on RBD-ACE2 binding. However, the 501.V2
variant weakened H11-H4 and H11-D4 binding while strengthening Ty1 binding to RBD. Our
simulations indicate that all three nanobodies can neutralize 501Y.V1 while Ty1 is more
effective against the 501.V2 variant.

Nanobodies are single-domain antibodies that are used in disease diagnosis and as drug carriers. 1
Because of their low molecular weight (12-30 kDa) and complexity, they can be mass-produced
rapidly at a low cost in bacteria or yeast.2,3 Recent studies identified several nanobodies, including
H11-H4, H11-D4, Ty1, Nb20, Nb6, and Sb23,

4-8

as promising drugs for neutralizing activity

against SARS-CoV-2 infection. These nanobodies specifically bind to the receptor-binding
domain (RBD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein4-8 and blocking its interaction with the human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).9,10 While Ty15, Nb206, Nb67, and Sb238 sterically
overlap with the ACE2 binding site5-8, H11-H44, and H11-D44 prevent ACE2 binding without an
overlap4. It remains unclear how these antibodies neutralize S-ACE2 interactions with and without
overlap with the ACE2 binding sites.
Recently, two SARS-CoV-2 variants (N501Y 11 and N501Y/E484K/K417N) were observed at a
fast-growing rate across the globe. While it remains unclear whether current treatments are
effective against these variants, nanobodies can be rapidly engineered using recombinant methods
in order to cope with the mutagenesis of the S protein. These studies would be greatly aided by an
understanding of how existing nanobodies neutralize the wild-type (WT) S protein at the molecular
level.
To address these challenges, we performed all-atom MD simulations totaling 27.6 ¬µs in length
using the recently-solved structures of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in complex with the
N-terminal peptidase domain (PD) of human ACE212. Simulations were performed for WT,
N501Y, and N501Y/E484K/K417N mutants of RBD in the presence or absence of the
nanobodies H11-H4 4, H11-D4 4, and Ty15. We also simulated the detachment of the nanobodies
from RBD at low pulling speeds (0.1 √Ö ùëõùë† ‚àí1 ) comparable to high-speed atomic force
microscopy (AFM) experiments to estimate the binding strength. These simulations revealed
additional interactions between RBD and the nanobodies to those observed in the crystal
structures4,5. Ty1 overlaps with the ACE2 binding site and more strongly binds to RBD than
ACE2. In comparison, H11-H4 and H11-D4 do not overlap with the ACE2 binding site and have
similar binding strength to ACE2. Instead of the steric clash, these two nanobodies disrupt SACE2 interactions by electrostatic repulsion when they are bound to RBD side by side.
Simulations on the N501Y mutant showed that it has minor effects on S-ACE2 and S-nanobody
interactions. However, the N501Y/E484K/K417N mutant reduced the binding strength of H11-

H4 and H11-D4 while increasing that of Ty1. These results suggest engineering principles to
neutralize RBD mutations that take place during the pandemic.

Figure 1. Nanobodies in complex with the RBD of S protein located on the viral membrane. The
atomic models were constructed using the full length S protein model13, the crystal structure of
RBD in complex with ACE2 (PDB: 6M17), and the crystal structures of RBD in complex with
the nanobodies H11-H4, H11-D4, and Ty1 (PDB: 6ZBP, 6YZ5, and 6ZXN, respectively). RBDnanobody interfaces are highlighted in boxes. ACE2 is superimposed on the crystal structures

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The Interaction Network between the RBD and Nanobodies. To model the dynamic
interactions of the nanobody-RBD binding interface, we used the co-structure of RBD of the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein in complex with H11-H44, H11-D44, and Ty15 (Figure 1). The structure
was solvated in a water box that contains physiologically relevant salt (150 mM NaCl)
concentration. For each nanobody-RBD complex, two sets of cMD simulations, each of 200 ns
in length, were performed to determine the formation of a salt bridge14 and a hydrogen bond, as
well as electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between RBD and PD (see Methods).

Observation frequencies were classified as high and moderate for interactions that occur in 49%
and above and between 15-48% of the total trajectory, respectively.15

Previously, we divided the RBD-ACE2 interaction surface into three contact regions (CR1-3,
Figure 2) and proposed that RBD-ACE2 interaction is primarily stabilized by hydrophobic
interactions in CR1. 15,16 Similar to ACE2, we observed that nanobodies form many pairwise
interactions with RBD. H11-H4 makes 10 hydrophobic interactions, (Figure 2), 5 hydrogen
bonds (Figure 2), 1 salt bridge, and 1 electrostatic interaction with RBD (Figure 2). The contact
region 1 (CR1) of RBD comprised about half of these interactions. In comparison, CR1
comprised 5 out of 12 interactions (5 hydrophobic interactions, 5 hydrogen bonds, 2 salt bridges,
and 2 electrostatic interactions) between H11-D4 and RBD (Figure 2). Ty1 forms a higher
number of interactions (24) than H11-H4 and H11-D4. We identified 18 hydrophobic
interactions, 6 hydrogen bonds, and 8 electrostatic interactions between Ty1 and RBD (Figure 2).
Most of these interaction sites are located in CR1 (Figure 2).

The interaction network we identified between the nanobodies and RBD is mostly consistent
with interactions in reported structures. 4,5 However, we observed additional 4 hydrophobic
interactions (F490-V102, F490-A32, L455-L105, Y449-W112) and 1 hydrogen bond (Q493Y104) for H11-H4, two hydrophobic interactions (F490-V102, L455-L105), and one salt bridge
(K444-E100) for H11-D4, and 6 hydrophobic interactions (L452-V102, L452-V4, L452-V109,
L492-F29, L492-V4, L492-I100) and two hydrogen bonds (S494-S107 and G447-Q112) for Ty1.
This difference may be due to different thermodynamic conditions between structural studies
versus MD simulations, which are performed under physiological conditions.17

ACE2 Release Upon Nanobody Binding. Similar to ACE2, the nanobodies primarily form
multiple hydrophobic interactions with CR1 and less strongly with CR2 of RBD. To understand
how these nanobodies disrupt S-ACE2 interactions, we first superimposed them together with
ACE2 on RBD. We observed that H11-H4 and H11-D4 do not overlap with the ACE2 binding
site, whereas Ty1 sterically overlaps with ACE2 (Figure 1). To investigate how H11-H4 and
H11-D4 could disrupt S-ACE2 binding without an overlap, we manually docked the structural
coordinates of the nanobodies from their co-structure with RBD4 onto the RBD-ACE2 complex.
We also altered the order of binding by docking the coordinates of ACE2 (PDB ID 6M0J12) onto
the RBD-nanobody (PDB ID 6ZBP, 6YZ5)4 crystal structures (Figure 3). Docking was
performed either before or after running conventional MD simulations for 100 ns in solution
conditions (Figure 3)

For H11-H4, we ran six 200 ns long conventional MD simulations under different docking
orders. In these simulations, H11-H4 binding to RBD abrogated 32.1-90.1% (65% on average) of
the high-frequency interactions between RBD and ACE215 (Figure 4, Figure S2). In all cases,
ACE2 first detached from CR1, and then lost its binding pose and partially unbound from RBD
(Supplementary Video S1). Close examination of the RBD-ACE2-nanobody conformers
revealed how nanobody binding results in ACE2 detachment in the absence of direct overlap.
We first ruled out the possibility that nanobody binding allosterically alters the interaction
surface between ACE2 and RBD. Instead, almost all of the pairwise interactions between RBD
and ACE2 remain unaltered, except the E484-K31 interaction was disrupted by the CDR3 loop
of H11-H4. We noticed that identically charged residues of ACE2 and nanobodies (D67 with 44,
K68 with R45, and E75 with D108) come in close vicinity and repel each other when both
proteins are bound to RBD side by side (Figure 3). In all simulations, H11-H4 won the ‚Äútug-ofwar‚Äù and moved ACE2 away from its binding site.

repulsion between ACE2 and H11-H4 upon H11-H4 docking. Neighboring ACE2 and H11-H4
residues with identical charges are highlighted in surface representation in red (negatively
charged) and blue (positively charged). Electrostatic repulsion among these charges dislocates
ACE2 from its binding site.
For H11-D4, two 200 ns long MD simulations were performed by docking the nanobody
structure on the RBD-ACE2 conformer obtained from the crystal structure (PDB ID 6M0J12,
6YZ54). Similar to H11-H4, docking of H11-D4 caused electrostatic repulsion between D67E44, K68-R45, and E75-D108 (ACE2-nanobody) residues. However, the electrostatic repulsion
between ACE2 and nanobody resulted in the disruption of fewer (%62.6 and 34.2%) RBD-ACE2
interactions and ACE2 remained bound to RBD within 200 ns simulation time (Figure 4, Figure
S2). These results suggest higher blocking effectiveness of H11-H4 than H11-D4 against ACE2
binding, consistent with higher neutralizing activity H11-H4 against SARS-CoV-2 infection4.

Figure 4. Effect of H11-H4 binding on interactions between RBD and ACE2. Pairwise
interactions between RBD and ACE2 were normalized by the total numbers of possible
interactions15. In the absence of the nanobodies, RBD and ACE2 stably maintained ~84% of
these interactions (red traces). The addition of nanobody to the existing ACE2-RBD complex or
the addition of ACE2 to the RBD-nanobody complex resulted in a substantial reduction of
pairwise interactions between RBD and ACE2 (blue traces). Time zero indicates the time instant
after minimization.
Unbinding of the Nanobodies from S protein under Force. To estimate the binding strength
of the nanobodies to RBD, we performed SMD simulations by pulling nanobodies at constant
velocities along the vector pointing away from the binding interface (Figure 5). Previous studies
typically used 2.5 - 50 ‚Ñ´ /ns speeds18-25, which overestimate the unbinding free energy. To better

estimate the unbinding free energy, we performed our simulations with a velocity of 0.1 √Ö ùëõùë† ‚àí1 ,
comparable to the velocities used in high-speed atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments 26

Steering forces were applied to the CŒ± atoms of the nanobody residues on the binding

interface, whereas CŒ± atoms of RBD residues at the binding interface were kept fixed.
For each nanobody, four 300 ns long SMD simulations (totaling 1200 ns in length, Table S1)
were initiated from different conformations sampled from conventional MD simulations. The
average work applied to unbind H11-H4, H11-D4, and Ty1 from RBD was 43.4 ¬± 10.7, 33.0 ¬±
6.4, and 35.7 ¬± 6.3 kcal/mol (mean ¬± s.d.), respectively. These values are comparable to 36.8 ¬±
9.4 kcal/mol work required to unbind RBD from ACE2 under the same pulling speed15. Thus,
while ACE2, H11-D4, and Ty1 have similar binding strength to RBD, H11-H4 binds more
strongly to RBD. However, based on the Student‚Äôs t-test work values were not statistically
different.

binding is affected by N501Y (501Y.V1 variant) and N501Y/E484K/K417N (501.V2 variant)
mutations on RBD. While N501Y and K417N mutations are located on the ACE2-RBD binding
interface, E484K is located on the nanobody-RBD binding interface (Figure 6). The total number
of interactions between the nanobodies and 501Y.V1 RBD is similar to that between the
nanobodies and WT RBD (Figure S5). However, the number of interactions between H11-H4
and H11-D4 and RBD decreases by 3 and 4, respectively, due to the mutations in 501Y.V2
mutations (Figure S6). Ty1 forms 2 additional hydrophobic interactions and 2 fewer hydrogen
bonds with the CR1 of 501Y.V2 RBD compared to WT (Figure S6).
We ran SMD simulations to investigate how these mutations affect the RBD binding strength of
ACE2 and the nanobodies. We found that ACE2 binds to these mutants as strongly as it binds to
WT RBD (Figure 6). Although we observed a slight decrease in the binding strength of H11-H4
and H11-D4 (19% and 15%, respectively) and an increase (19%) in Ty1 binding strength to
N501Y, unbinding work values between WT and N501Y were not statistically different (p >
0.13, a two-tailed Student‚Äôs t-test). To provide a more extensive sampling of starting
conformations, we also ran 20 SMD simulations at higher pulling speeds (2 √Ö ùëõùë† ‚àí1 ). As
expected, an increase in pulling speed resulted in higher unbinding work values (Figure S7).
Similar to the SMD simulations performed with a pulling speed of 0.1 √Ö ùëõùë† ‚àí1 , binding strengths
of the nanobodies to WT and N501Y RBD were not statistically different under the same
velocity and thermodynamic conditions.
Unlike N501Y, the N501Y/E484K/K417N triple mutations decreased the binding strengths of
H11-H4 and H11-D4 by 34.5% and 16.5%, respectively, at a pulling speed of 0.1 √Ö ùëõùë† ‚àí1 .
Simulations performed at 2 √Ö ùëõùë† ‚àí1 pulling speeds also revealed significantly lower unbinding
work values from N501Y/E484K/K417N RBD for both H11-H4 and H11-D4. These changes
can be attributed to the loss of a salt bridge and a hydrogen bond due to the E484K mutation. In
contrast to H11-H4 and H11-D4, the binding strength of Ty1 increased by 71.8% (Figure 6),
nearly twice as strong as the binding strength of other nanobodies and ACE2 to this mutant (p
=0.008, a two-tailed Student‚Äôs t-test). This may be due to the formation of an extensive network
of interactions between the RBD loop (on which K484 is located) and Ty1 (Figure S11). These
results suggest that Ty1 can be more effective than H11-H4 and H11-D4 in neutralizing the
501.V2 variant of SARS-CoV-2.

To investigate whether H11-H4 and H11-D4 binding can abrogate ACE2 binding to the N501Y
and N501Y/E484K/K417N mutant RBDs, we performed three sets of conventional MD
simulations for the ACE2-RBDmutant-nanobody trimeric complex (Figure S8). H11-D4 was
unable to displace ACE2 from the RBD mutants, similar to that observed in WT RBD. Although
H11-H4 was able to unbind ACE2 from WT RBD in all six simulations, it was able to unbind
ACE2 from N501Y RBD in only 1 out of 3 simulations and from N501Y/E484K/K417N RBD in
2 out of 3 simulations. These results suggest that H11-H4 is less effective in preventing ACE2
binding to the 501Y and 501Y.V2 variants compared to the WT SARS-CoV-2.

CONCLUSIONS
We performed an extensive in silico analysis to explore how nanobodies H11-H4, H11-D4, and
Ty1 disrupt S-ACE2 interactions, and whether these nanobodies can also neutralize the SARSCoV-2 variants 501Y.V1 and 501.V2. Pulling nanobodies away from WT and mutant S protein
RBDs at velocities comparable to those applied at atomic force microscopies enabled us to
estimate the nanobody binding strengths and how binding strength is affected by the RBD
mutations. Furthermore, by docking of nanobodies (H11-H4 and H11-D4) onto the ACE2-RBD
complex or ACE2 onto the RBD-nanobody complexes, we provided a mechanistic explanation
of how nanobodies abrogate ACE2 binding from WT and mutant RBD.
Our simulation showed that H11-H4 binds to RBD stronger than H11-D4 and Ty1 and also
ACE2. Furthermore, H11-H4 was able to abrogate ACE2 binding in all 6 sets of simulations. On
the contrary, H11-D4 binding strength is indistinguishable from ACE2 and it was not able to
abrogate ACE2 binding during the length of our simulations. Ty1 also showed similar binding
strength as ACE2 to RBD. Taken all together, our MD simulations suggest that H11-H4 is the
most effective inhibitor for WT RBD among the three nanobodies investigated in this study.
H11-H4‚Äôs effectiveness in abrogating ACE2 binding was diminished by N501Y and
N501Y/E484K/K417N mutations of RBD. H11-D4 also did not show abrogation of ACE2
binding within our simulation lengths. These results are consistent with recent studies that
reported a minimal and moderate impact of antibodies on 501Y.V1 and 501.V2 variants. 27-32
Strikingly, Ty1 binds to the triple RBD mutant two times stronger than ACE2. Super positioning
of crystal structures shows that Ty1 sterically blocks ACE2 binding, whereas H11-H4 and H11D4 did not show direct steric overlap with ACE2. Thus, based on the high binding strength of
Ty1 to N501Y/E484K/K417N RBD in comparison to ACE2, we predict that Ty1 will be able to
neutralize 501.V2 variants by sterically blocking ACE2 binding.

METHODS
MD Simulations System Preparation. As was done in our previous study15, for cMD
simulations of the S-ACE2 complex the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD bound
with ACE2 at 2.45 √Ö resolution (PDB ID: 6M0J)12 was used as a template. For the nanobodies
crystal structures (PDB ID 6ZBP) 4, (PDB ID 6YZ5) 4, and (6ZXN)5 were used as templates for
H11-H4 - RBD, H11-D4 - RBD, and Ty1-RBD systems. The chloride ion, zinc ion, glycans, and
water molecules in the crystal structure were kept in their original positions. Each system was
solvated in a water box (using the TIP3P water model) having 25 √Ö cushion in each directions
using VMD.33 This puts a 50 √Ö water cushion between the protein complexes and their periodic
images. For SMD simulations systems were solvated having 50√Ö cushion in the positive x
directions and 15√Ö cushion in all other directions, creating enough space for unbinding
simulations. Ions were added to neutralize the system and salt concentration was set to 150 mM
to construct a physiologically relevant environment. The size of each solvated system was
~164,000 atoms. All system preparation steps were performed in VMD.33
Conventional MD Simulations. All MD simulations were performed in NAMD 2.1334 using the
CHARMM3635 force field with a time step of 2 fs. MD simulations were performed under N, P,
T conditions. The temperature was kept at 310 K using Langevin dynamics with a damping
coefficient of 1 ps-1. The pressure was maintained at 1 atm using the Langevin Nos√©-Hoover
method with an oscillation period of 100 fs and a damping time scale of 50 fs. Periodic boundary
conditions were applied. 12 √Ö cutoff distance was used for van der Waals interactions. Longrange electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle-mesh Ewald method. For each
system; first, 10,000 steps of minimization followed by 2 ns of equilibration was performed by
keeping the protein fixed. The complete system was minimized for additional 10,000 steps,
followed by 4 ns of equilibration by applying constraints on CŒ± atoms. Subsequently, these
constraints were released and the system was equilibrated for an additional 4 ns before initiating
the production runs. The length of the equilibrium steps is expected to account for the structural
differences due to the radically different thermodynamic conditions of crystallization solutions
and MD simulations.17 MD simulations were performed in Comet and Stampede2 using ~8
million core-hours in total.

Criterion for interactions. As a salt bridge formation criteria, a cutoff distance of 6 √Ö between
the basic nitrogens and acidic oxygens was used.14 A maximum 3.5 √Ö distance between
hydrogen bond donor and acceptor and a 30¬∞ angle between the hydrogen atom, the donor heavy
atom, and the acceptor heavy atom was used to score a hydrogen bond formation,.36 Interaction
pairs that did not satisfy the angle criterion, but the distance criterion were analyzed as
electrostatic interactions. A cutoff distance of 8 √Ö between the side chain carbon atoms was used
for hydrophobic interactions.37-39
RMSF Calculations. RMSF values were calculated as ‚å©‚àÜùëÖùëñ2 ‚å™1/2 = ‚å©(ùëÖùëñ ‚àí ‚å©ùëÖùëñ ‚å™ )2 ‚å™1/2, where,
‚å©ùëÖùëñ ‚å™ is the mean atomic coordinate of the ith CŒ± atom and ùëÖùëñ is its instantaneous coordinate.
SMD Simulations. SMD40 simulations were used to explore the unbinding process of RBD from
ACE2 on time scales accessible to standard simulation lengths. SMD simulations have been
applied to explore a wide range of processes, including domain motion,41,42 molecule
unbinding,43 and protein unfolding.44 In SMD simulations, a dummy atom is attached to the
center of mass of ‚Äòsteered‚Äô atoms via a virtual spring and pulled at constant velocity along the
‚Äòpulling direction‚Äô, resulting in force F to be applied to the SMD atoms along the pulling
vector,34

where ùëà is the guiding potential, ùëò is the spring constant, ùêØ is the pulling velocity, ùë° is time,
ùêë and ùêë 0 are the coordinates of the center of mass of steered atoms at time t and 0, respectively,
and ùêß is the direction of pulling.34 Total work (W) performed for each simulation was evaluated
ùúâ

by integrating F over displacement ùúâ along the pulling direction as = ‚à´0 ùêπ(ùúâ)ùëëùúâ .
In SMD simulations of SARS-CoV-2, CŒ± atoms of ACE2 residues S19-S43, T78-P84, Q325N330, G352-I358, and P389-R393 were kept fixed, whereas CŒ± atoms of RBD residues K417I418, G446-F456, Y473-A475, and N487-Y505 were steered (Figure 5). Steered atoms were
selected as the region comprising the interacting residues. For SARS-CoV SMD simulations the
same ACE2 residues were kept fixed. However, two slightly different steered atoms selections

were applied: i) Using the same residue positions as for SARS-CoV-2, which are V404-I405,
T433-L443, F460-S461, and N473-Y491, and ii) selecting the region comprising the interacting
residues, which areT433-L443, F460-D463, and N473-Y491. The total number of fixed and
steered atoms were identical in all simulations. The pulling direction was selected as the vector
pointing from the center of mass of fixed atoms to the center of mass of steered atoms. The
pulling direction also serves as the reaction coordinate Œæ for free energy calculations. Each SMD
simulation was performed for 300 ns using a 0.1 √Ö ùëõùë† ‚àí1 pulling velocity. At a spring constant of
100 ùëòùëêùëéùëô ùëöùëúùëô ‚àí1 √Ö ‚àí2, the center of mass of the steered atoms followed the dummy atom closely
while the spring was still soft enough to allow small deviations. For each system, 4
conformations were sampled with a 100 ns frequency (100 and 200 ns time instant). These
conformations served as 4 separate starting conformations, ùêë 0 , for each set of SMD simulations.
