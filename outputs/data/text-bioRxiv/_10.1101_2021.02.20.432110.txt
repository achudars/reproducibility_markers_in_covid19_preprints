Abstract

33

Since its initial discovery in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

34

CoV-2), the cause of COVID19, has spread worldwide and despite significant research efforts, treatment

35

options remain limited. Replication of SARS-CoV-2 in lung is associated with marked infiltration of

36

macrophages and activation of innate immune inflammatory responses triggered, in part, by heightened

37

production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) that recruits lymphocytes to the site of infection that amplify tissue injury.

38

Antagonists of the glucocorticoid and androgen receptors have shown promise in experimental models of

39

COVID19 and in clinical studies, because cell surface proteins required for viral entry, angiotensin

40

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), are transcriptionally

41

regulated by these receptors. We therefore postulated that the glucocorticoid (GR) and androgen receptor

42

(AR) antagonist, PT150, would reduce infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent inflammatory lung injury

43

in the Syrian golden hamster model of COVID19. Animals were infected intranasally with 2.5 × 104

44

TCID50/ml equivalents of SARS-CoV-2 (strain 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/ 2020) and PT150 was

45

administered by oral gavage at 30 and 100 mg/Kg/day for a total of 7 days. Animals were then examined

46

at days 3, 5 and 7 post-infection (DPI) for lung histopathology, viral load and production of proteins

47

regulating the initiation and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results of these studies indicated that

48

oral administration of PT150 decreased replication of SARS-CoV-2 in lung, as well as expression of ACE2

49

and TMPRSS2 protein. Hypercellularity and inflammatory cell infiltration driven by macrophage responses

50

were dramatically decreased in PT150-treated animals, as was tissue damage and expression of IL-6.

51

Molecular modeling suggested that PT150 binds to the co-activator interface of the ligand binding domain

52

of both AR and GR and thereby acts as an allosteric modulator and transcriptional repressor of these

53

receptors. Phylogenetic analysis of AR and GR across multiple species permissive to SARS-CoV-2

54

infection revealed a high degree of sequence identity maintained across species, including human,

55

suggesting that the mechanism of action and therapeutic efficacy observed in Syrian hamsters would likely

56

be predictive of positive outcomes in patients. PT150 is therefore a strong candidate for further clinical

57

development for the treatment of COVID19 across variants of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

59

Emerging in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, several unidentified cases of severe pneumonia

60

were reported of which were epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal wholesale market.

61

Through deep sequencing of lower respiratory samples from these patients, a novel betacoronavirus was

62

identified [1, 2] and has since been distinguished as the initial point source of the biological threat that has

63

now developed into a global pandemic. As of late 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

64

(SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 40 million people and has been responsible for over 1.14 million deaths

65

[3] and continues to surge in many countries. The infection can be spread through respiratory droplet

66

transmission from asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic carriers [4] making diagnosis and

67

quarantine efforts difficult, ultimately leading to increased propagation and dissemination of infectious

68

virus.

69

Coronaviruses (Order: Nidovirales; Family: Coronaviridae) are enveloped, non-segmented,

70

positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that contain very large genomes up to 33.5 kilobases (kb). The

71

four subtypes (genera) of these viruses – alpha, beta, gamma, and delta-coronaviruses – share a highly

72

conserved genome organization comprising a large replicase gene followed by structural and accessory

73

genes. The organization of the coronavirus genome is organized from the 5’-leader-UTR, replicase,

74

S(spike), E(envelope), M(membrane), N(nucleocapsid) to the 3’ UTR poly (A) tail [5]. Notably, production

75

of the spike protein has been linked to severity of disease. The spike protein is a proteolytically processed

76

glycoprotein that extends from the viral membrane and modulates virus-cell membrane fusion. In order to

77

acquire functionality, the protein must undergo multiple stepwise endoproteolytic cleavages [6]. The spike

78

glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has two domains, the S1 domain comprising residues 12 – 667 and the S2

79

domain, comprising residues 668 -1273. The S1 subunit contains the receptor binding domain (RBD),

80

which interacts with the ACE2 receptor, whereas the S2 subunit remains associated with the viral envelope

81

[7]. Viral infection requires proteolytic cleavage at Arg685-Ser686 at the S1 site by the transmembrane

82

protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), followed by cleavage at the S2 site at Arg815-Ser816 [6]. Proteolytic

83

cleavage of the spike protein then enables membrane fusion and entry into the host cell in complex with the

84

ACE2 receptor [8].

85

Downregulating expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 has therefore emerged as an important

86

therapeutic strategy for the treatment of COVID19 in order to increase host defense by preventing entry of

87

SARS-CoV-2 into cells, thereby limiting viral replication. Clinical evidence supports this hypothesis, where

88

a prospective study reported a decrease in the rate of intensive care unit admissions in men who had been

89

prescribed anti-androgens for six months prior to hospitalization [9]. Both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are highly

90

expressed in bronchiolar epithelial cells and transcriptionally regulated at the promoter level through the

91

androgen receptor (AR) [8]. In a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, inhibitors of AR transcriptional activity

92

markedly reduced viral infectivity and decreased inflammatory lung injury in experimental animals [8].

93

Both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are also significantly regulated by inflammation. ACE2, as well as the

94

inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), are non-canonical interferon-responsive genes (ISGs) that are

95

highly expressed following infection with SARS-CoV-2 [10]. Inflammation also directly upregulates

96

expression of TMPRSS2 [11]. Steroids have therefore been extensively used to treat COVID19 patients,

97

albeit with mixed results. A recent study in The Lancet indicated that clinical evidence does not support

98

corticosteroid treatment for SARS-CoV-2-related lung injury. Patients who were given corticosteroids were

99

more likely to require mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy [12].

100

Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone have been shown to increase expression of ACE2 [13, 14], which

101

would enhance viral entry and replication and could therefore worsen infection when given too early.

102

Dexamethasone also modestly increased expression of TMPRSS2 in these studies, which could likewise

103

potentially enhance membrane fusion and vesicular uptake of SARS-CoV-2. Neither hydrocortisone nor

104

prednisolone were able to decrease expression of TMPRSS2 [13]. Thus, better therapeutics are needed that

105

can modulate these receptor systems to downregulate expression of proteins critical to viral entry.

106

During viral RNA synthesis, both genomic and sub-genomic RNAs are produced that serve as

107

mRNAs for the structural and accessory proteins that are downstream of viral replicase proteins [5]. SARS-

108

CoV-2 contains up to seven stem-loop regulatory sequences in the 5’-UTR that that are thought to control

109

stages of RNA synthesis and may confer species specificity for virulence [5, 15]. In part because a number

110

of human RNA viruses have glucocorticoid receptor cis-acting elements in their 5-UTR’s, antagonists of

111

the glucocorticoid receptor are one potential class of drugs for therapeutic modulation of SARS-CoV-2

112

infection. A report comparing the host inflammatory response to SARS-CoV (SARS1) and HCoV-EMC

113

(MERS) revealed a unique set of 207 genes dysregulated during the course of infection. Based on these

114

data, the authors predicted that selected kinase inhibitors and glucocorticoid receptor modulators could

115

function as potential antiviral compounds [16]. These studies suggested two important points about

116

modulating infection with human coronaviruses: 1) targeting cellular responses has been shown to inhibit

117

viral replication and 2) immunomodulatory drugs that reduce the excessive host inflammatory response to

118

respiratory viruses have therapeutic benefit, as seen with influenza virus infections [16].

119

However, classical antagonists of glucocorticoid function that compete for interaction at the steroid

120

binding pocket of the receptor ligand binding domain (LBD) could be problematic, due to excessive

121

blockade of cortisol function. Thus, allosteric modulators of both AR and GR that could dampen

122

transcriptional activation through these receptors would be preferable. Such interactions tend to favor

123

stabilization of transcriptional co-repressor proteins on chromatin, such as CoREST, HDAC2/3/4 and

124

NCoR2, that prevent binding of co-activator proteins in response to activation of cis-acting transcription

125

factors [17, 18]. To address the potential for a transcriptional modulator to protect against SARS-CoV-2

126

infection through downregulation of AR/GR-dependent expression of ACE2 and TMPRS22, we examined

127

the therapeutic efficacy of (11β,17β)-11-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-17-hydroxy-17-(1-propynyl)-estra-4,9-

128

dien-3-one (designated as “PT150”), a synthetic AR and GR modulator shown to antagonize human GR

129

[19, 20]. In a screening study conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, PT150

130

had broad inhibitory activity towards several RNA viruses, including influenza, Zika virus and β-

131

coronaviruses, and was recently shown to have direct anti-viral effects against SARS-CoV-2 in human

132

bronchiolar epithelial cells in vitro [21]. Based on these data, and on previous host-pathogen interaction

133

studies, we postulated that PT150 would be an effective inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo in the

134

Syrian golden hamster model of COVID19. The results of this study demonstrate that PT150 given orally

Materials and Methods

138

Virus and cell culture procedures

139

SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 was obtained from BEI Resources and

140

propagated on Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81, American Type Culture Collection) at 37°C with 5% CO2. Virus

141

titrations from animal tissues were performed by plaque assay as described previously [21]. Plaques were

142

visualized two days post inoculation following fixation with 10% formalin for 30 minutes, and addition of

143

0.25% crystal violet solution in 20% ethanol.

144
145

Animal procedures

146

All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Use Committee at. Colorado State

147

University (IACUC Protocol No. 996), hamsters were handled in compliance with the PHS Policy and

148

Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and procedures were performed in accordance with

149

National Institutes of Health guidelines. Male and female Syrian hamsters were used in studies at 8 weeks

150

of age (N=60, Charles River Laboratory). The animals were housed in the CSU animal facility and allowed

151

access to standard pelleted feed and water ad libitum prior to being moved to the Biosafety Level 3

152

containment facility for experimental infection. Hamsters were anesthetized by inhalation with isoflurane

153

and then intranasally inoculated with 2.5 × 104 TCID50/ml equivalents of SARS-CoV-2 (strain 2019-

154

nCoV/USA-WA1/ 2020) in sterile Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM). Hamsters not receiving

155

SARS-CoV-2 were given a sham inoculation with the equivalent volume of DMEM vehicle. To assess

156

activity of PT150 (supplied by Palisades Therapeutics/Pop Test Oncology LLC) against SARS-CoV-2,

157

experimental groups (N=6 animals per group at each timepoint) were as follows: control (sham inoculation

158

+ miglyol vehicle), SARS-CoV-2 + miglyol, SARS-CoV-2 + 30 mg/Kg PT150, SARS-CoV-2 + 100 mg/Kg

159

PT150. The experimental drug (PT150) was dissolved in 100% miglyol 812 and delivered by oral gavage

160

at 8 µL/gm body weight under isoflurane anesthesia. Animals were weighed daily to deliver an accurate

161

dose of drug. The SARS-CoV-2 + vehicle group also received miglyol 812 by oral gavage. Animals were

162

observed for clinical symptomology at time of dosing each day (lethargy, ruffled fur, hunched back posture,

163

nasolacrimal discharge, and rapid breathing). Groups of animals were terminated at 3, 5 and 7 days post-

164

infection (DPI). Eighteen hamsters (6 SARS-CoV-2 + vehicle, 6 SARS-CoV-2 + 30 mg/Kg PT150; 6

165

SARS-CoV-2 + 100mg/Kg PT150) were euthanized at 3 and 5 DPI. On day 7 post-infection (7 DPI) the

166

remaining 24 hamsters were euthanized (6 DMEM + miglyol; 6 SARS-CoV-2 + vehicle, 6 SARS-CoV-2

167

+ 30 mg/Kg PT150; 6 SARS-CoV-2 + 100mg/Kg PT150). Animals were terminated by decapitation under

168

isoflurane anesthesia and tissue was collected for immunohistochemistry, viral isolation, RNA analysis and

169

histopathology.

170
171

Histopathology

172

Lungs from 60 hamsters were extirpated en bloc and fixed whole in 10% neutral buffered formalin under

173

Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) containment for at least 72 hours before being transferred to CSU Veterinary

174

Diagnostic Laboratory, BSL-2 necropsy area for tissue trimming and sectioning. Four transverse whole-

175

lung sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Tissue was sectioned at 5µm thickness and

176

were mounted onto poly-ionic slides. Sections were then deparaffinized and immunostained using the Leica

177

RXm automated robotic staining system. Antigen retrieval was performed by using Bond Epitope Retrieval

178

Solutions 1 and 2 for 20 minutes each in conjunction with base plate heat application. Sections were then

179

permeabilized (0.1% Triton X in 1X TBS) and blocked with 1% donkey serum. Primary antibodies were

180

diluted to their optimized dilutions in tris-buffered saline and incubated on the tissue for 1 hour/antibody:

181

Rabbit SARS nucleocapsid protein (SARS-CoV-2; Rockland; 1:500), goat ionized calcium binding adaptor

182

molecule 1 (IBA1; Abcam; 1:50), goat angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2;R&D Systems; 1:500),

183

rabbit transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2; Abcam; 1:500), mouse interleukin 6 (IL-6;

184

ThermoFisher; 1:500). Sections were then stained for DAPI (Sigma) and were mounted on glass coverslips

185

using ProLong Gold Anti-Fade medium and stored at 4°C until imaging.

Immunofluorescence Imaging and Protein Quantification

190

The studies described here were conducted by a single investigator. Images were captured using an

191

automated stage Olympus BX63 fluorescent microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-flash 4.0 LT

192

CCD camera and collected using Olympus CellSens software. Quantification of protein was performed by

193

acquiring five randomized images encompassing the pseudostratified columnar epithelium around bronchi

194

at 400x magnification (Olympus X-Apochromat air objective; N.A. 0.95) all from different lung lobes.

195

Regions of interest were then drawn to enclose the epithelial layer and exclude the lumen, in order to

196

accurately obtain average intensity measurements. The Count and Measure function on Olympus CellSens

197

software was then used to threshold the entirety of the ROI and measure the given channel signal.

198

Quantification of invading inflammatory cells was performed by generating whole lung montages by

199

compiling 100x images acquired using automated stage coordinate mapping with an Olympus 10X air

200

objective (0.40 N.A.) All images were obtained and analyzed under the same conditions for magnification,

201

exposure time, lamp intensity, camera gain, and filter application. ROIs were drawn around the lung

202

sections and the co-localization function of Count and Measure within Olympus CellSens software was

203

applied the sections. IBA1+ cells were determined per 1mm2 areas given the previously drawn ROI overall

204

area.

205
206

Quantification of Inflammatory Cell Infiltration and Consolidation

207

Quantification of the total affected pulmonary parenchyma as well as counting of inflammatory

208

cells per area (region of interest, ROI, 1mm2) was determined in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) -

209

stained histological sections by digital image analysis. A digital montage was compiled at 100X

210

magnification using an Olympus X-Apochromat 10X air objective (N.A. 0.40) consisting of

211

approximately 1,200 individual frames per lung lobe. Affected regions of interest (ROI’s) were

212

subsequently automatically identified using Olympus CellSens software by quantifying whole-

lung montages scanned from each hamster for total number of nuclei or nucleated cells (to exclude

214

erythrocytes) stained with H&E, relative to the total area of the ROI for each lung.

215
216

Computational-based Modeling

217

PT150 was docked into the crystal structures of the ligand-binding domain of the androgen receptor (PDB:

218

2PIT) [22], and the glucocorticoid receptor (PDB: 3CLD) [23], using the Glide module within Schrödinger

219

(Release 2020-2, Schrödinger LLC, New York, NY) [24-26]. Prior to docking, the water molecules were

220

removed, and the proteins were prepared by assigning bond orders, adding hydrogens, and repairing any

221

side chains or missing amino acid sequences. To complete protein preparation a restrained minimization of

222

the protein structure was performed using the default constraint of 0.30Å RMSD and the OPLS_2005 force

223

field [27]. The prepared proteins were subjected to SiteMap analysis [26], that identified the available

224

binding sites in the ligand binding domains of the androgen and glucocorticoid receptors and docking grids

225

were generated using Receptor Grid Generation. PT150 prepared using LigPrep by generating possible

226

states at the target pH 7.0 using Epik and minimized by applying the OPLS_2005 force field [27].

227

Molecular docking simulations were performed targeting each potential binding site for PT150 using the

228

Glide ligand docking module in XP (extra precision) mode and included post-docking minimization [25].

229
230

Phylogenetic Analysis and Similarity Score Representation

231

Phylogenetic analysis was performed by investigating protein coding sequences across multiple species

232

within the protein of interest. FASTA files were downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology

233

Institute’s (NCBI) gene databases and were then input into Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis

234

(MEGAX, v.10.1.8) software for alignment. Muscle alignment was performed, and a neighbor-joining

235

phylogenetic tree was constructed. Similarity scores between species were generated by utilizing the

236

Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for protein-protein comparison on the National Center for

237

Biotechnology Information interface.

Results

239
240

Clinical observations and levels of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs of Syrian hamsters treated with PT150. Oral

241

gavage with PT150 or vehicle began on the same day as infection with 2.5 x 104 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2

242

(USA-WA1-2020 strain) by intranasal inoculation. Body weights were monitored daily for each animal,

243

with a noted decline in average body weight in each experimental group that reached a maximum loss by

244

day 5 with a total overall loss of eight-percent body weight (Fig 1A,B). This finding is consistent with other

245

longitudinal studies in Syrian golden hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 that demonstrate the maximal

246

clinical severity of disease at day 5 post-infection [28, 29]. Infected hamsters treated with vehicle-only

247

showed the greatest decline in body weight relative to controls, that was prevented by treatment with PT150

248

at 30 and 100 mg/Kg/day (Fig 1A). Two-way ANOVA analysis indicated a difference with treatment

249

(p<0.0007, F (3,92)=6.231) and time post-infection (p<0.0001, F (7,92)=16.39). Hamsters treated with

250

PT150 at 30 and 100 mg/Kg/day did not show a statistically significant difference in body weight from

251

control hamsters at day 5 post-infection, at which the maximal extent of body weight loss is observed in

252

Syrian hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with vehicle only (Fig 1B). Hamsters challenged

253

with SARS-CoV-2 showed marked lethargy, ataxia, ruffled fur, altered posture and overall decreased

254

movement and exploratory behavior, clinical signs and behaviors that were observably less pronounced in

255

hamsters treated with 30 mg/Kg/day PT150. Infected hamsters treated with 100 mg/Kg/day PT150

256

displayed clinical behavior largely indistinguishable from uninfected control animals.

each experimental group are presented in Figure 2. In hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2, affected

261

portions of lungs showed marked histiocytic/neutrophilic broncho-interstitial pneumonia with hyperplasia

262

of pneumocyte type II and formation of both bronchiolar and alveolar syncytial cells (Fig 2A-C, low power

images and high magnification insets). Inflammation equally involved main branches of the pulmonary

artery, where infiltrating macrophages were observed dissecting the tunica media and lifting the tunica

265

intima, with clustering of circulating monocytes along hypertrophied, apoptotic and occasionally

266

hyperplastic endothelial lining cells. Lungs from vehicle-treated infected hamsters show approximately

267

70% destruction of pulmonary parenchyma by an intense mixed inflammatory infiltrate with marked

268

expansion of alveolar interstitium, as well as peri-bronchial inflammation and arteritis of large pulmonary

269

vessels. Of note, peri-bronchial inflammation and arteritis of a large pulmonary vessel was observed (Fig

270

2B). High power images (Fig 2B,C, insets) of the bronchiolar wall show inflammatory cells comprising

271

macrophages and neutrophils dissecting through bronchiolar muscular wall with similar infiltration of

272

several rows of monocytes/macrophages lifting the tunica intima and dissecting the tunica media. By 7 DPI,

273

infected animals treated with vehicle-only (Fig 2C) had less inflammation, with clearing of luminal

274

infiltrates in smaller bronchioles. High power images show reduced clustering of monocytes/macrophages

275

in pulmonary arteries with lingering inflammation in medium-sized bronchioles and parenchymal

276

consolidation. Treatment with PT150 at 30 mg/Kg/day (Fig 2D-F) and 100 mg/Kg/day (Fig 2G-I)

277

alleviated the extent of inflammation in main stem bronchi and respiratory bronchioles, as well as in

278

medium-sized pulmonary arteries. The percentage of normal to affected parenchyma showing significant

279

resolution was markedly increased in PT150-treated animals, particularly in the 100 mg/Kg/day group, even

280

at the peak of inflammatory infiltration by 5 DPI (Fig 2H, low and high-power images). In the 100

281

mg/Kg/day treatment group, there was near complete resolution within the parenchyma by 7 DPI (Fig 2I,

282

low and high-power images), relative to untreated animals infected with SARS-CoV-2, which showed

283

significant consolidation and loss of parenchymal structure by 7 DPI (Fig 2C, low and high-power images).

284

In addition, the number of apoptotic endothelial cells in pulmonary bronchi was greatly reduced by

285

treatment with 100 mg/Kg/day PT150 (Fig 2G-I, high magnification insets). In hamsters treated with 100

286

mg/Kg/day PT150, there was a marked reduction in the inflammatory response within bronchioles,

287

interstitium and arteries, with almost complete resolution of bronchiolar inflammation and reduced

288

clustering of circulating monocytes to a marginating single row. No medial dissection is observed in these

expression and histopathology is depicted in the diagram in Fig 2J.

291
292

Analysis of immune cell infiltration and broncho-interstitial pneumonia in lung tissue of animals exposed

293

to SARS-CoV-2. Lungs were examined for the extent of immune cell infiltration at 3, 5 and 7 days post-

294

infection (DPI) by quantitative digital image analysis (Fig 3). Whole mount sections of paraffin-embedded

295

lung tissue were stained with H&E and bright field grayscale images were collected using a microscope

296

equipped with a scanning motorized stage. Pseudo-colored H&E images are depicted in blue, overlaid with

297

ROIs detected by intensity thresholding in red. Hematoxylin-positive immune cell soma were rendered as

298

focal points within the regions of interest to calculate the percent hypercellularity of tissue following

299

infection with SARS-CoV-2. By 3 DPI, lung tissue showed significant infiltration of immune cells in the

300

SARS-CoV-2 + vehicle group in addition to widespread hemorrhaging (Fig 3A). Immune cell infiltration

301

was decreased in dose-dependent fashion by treatment with PT150 at 30 and 100 mg/Kg/day (Fig 3D-F,

302

G-I). Uninfected control hamsters treated with vehicle-only, displayed minimal levels of macrophage

303

hypercellularity with clear bronchi and open parenchyma and an absence of inflammatory infiltrate (Fig

304

3J). The percent of total lung area displaying immune cell hypercellularity was quantified by ROI

305

thresholding and normalizing to the total lung section area (Fig 3K). This effectively showed the post-

306

infection response mediated by immune-cell infiltration. There was a time-dependent increase in cellular

307

reactivity, tissue pathology and bronchio-interstitial pneumonia. The peak of cellular infiltration occurred

308

at the 7-day timepoint revealing progressive consolidation. These affects are decreases with the

309

administration of PT150 at the 30mg/Kg/day dose as well as the 100mg/Kg/day dose.

Phylogenetic analysis and molecular docking with the androgen and glucocorticoid receptors. Because

312

expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2R are regulated through the andro-corticosteroid signaling pathway [7,

313

11, 30], we examined the genetic sequence identity of the glucocorticoid and androgen receptors across

314

multiple species associated with propagation of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 4). Comparing sequences of the

14

315

androgen receptor (Fig 4A) indicated a high degree of identity between all species analyzed, with sequence

316

concordance values with the human gene ranging from 84.62 (golden hamster) and 85.47 (greater horseshoe

317

bat) to 98.26 (sunda pangolin). Similarly, sequence concordance values with the human gene for the

318

glucocorticoid receptor (Fig 4B) ranged from 89.96 (golden hamster) and 90.89 (greater horseshoe bat) to

319

95.00 (sunda pangolin). Sequence similarity between these genes amongst difference species is relevant for

320

both potential zoonotic propagation of SARS-CoV-2 as well as to the testing of potential therapeutic

321

compounds acting through the androgen and glucocorticoid receptors.

322

PT150 was docked into the crystal structures of the ligand-binding domain of the androgen receptor

323

(PDB: 2PIT) and the glucocorticoid receptor (PDB: 3CLD), using the Glide module within Schrödinger

324

(Release 2020-2, Schrödinger LLC, New York, NY) [9-11]. For the androgen receptor (Fig 4C,D), the

325

PDB: 2PIT structure was selected due to the 1.76Å resolution and good coverage of the ligand binding

326

domain of the androgen receptor (251 residues). PT150 showed optimal binding to the peptide activator

327

allosteric site on the androgen receptor but did not dock into the steroid binding site identified for

328

dihydrotestosterone. For the glucocorticoid receptor, the PDB: 3CLD was selected due to the 2.84Å

329

resolution, limited other available structures and good coverage of the ligand binding domain of the

330

glucocorticoid receptor (259 residues). Similar to the analysis of the androgen receptor, PT150

331

preferentially bound to the co-activator peptide allosteric binding site of the glucocorticoid receptor (Fig

332

4E,F). No anchoring interactions were observed for the steroid binding pocket.

333
334

ACE2 and TMPRSS2 production and regulation in animals infected with SARS-CoV-2. The ACE2 receptor

335

and the cell surface TMPRSS2 serine protease are required for viral binding and S-protein priming to

336

facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells. We therefore examined production of these proteins in lung

337

tissue from infected hamsters with and without PT150 treatment. ACE2 intensity measurements were

338

quantified by immunofluorescence imaging (Fig 5), where pseudostratified columnar epithelium lining

339

bronchioles showed marked decreases in ACE2 production relative to vehicle control (Fig 5J) with the

340

administration of 100mg/kg/day of PT150 at the 3-day timepoint as well as the 7-day timepoint (Fig 5G-I,

15

341

K). Decreased ACE2 production was also observed in the 30mg/kg/day PT150 lung sections at 7DPI (Fig

342

5F). Production of ACE2 in vehicle-treated SARS-CoV-2 lung sections were similar to control until the 7-

343

day timepoint, at which point production reached a maximum (Fig 5A-C). Expression of TMPRSS2 within

344

bronchiolar cells was increased in the untreated lung sections infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 6A-C, K),

345

indicating induction associated with enhanced levels of viral entry, replication and dissemination. In

346

contrast, the 100mg/kg/day PT150 treated animals showed significant decreases in TMPRSS2 protein

347

levels at all timepoints (Fig 6G-I) similar to levels observed in the control group (Fig 6J-K). There was

348

also reduction in TMPRSS2 proteins levels within the 30 mg/kg/day treatment groups at 5DPI and 7DPI

349

(Fig 6D-F, K), similar to levels in control animals at 7DPI.

350
351

Inflammatory activation of macrophages and release of interleukin-6 is decreased by PT150 treatment in

352

Syrian hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 in parallel with decreased viral load. The peak of infectivity

353

and viral replication within the Syrian hamster model at sampled time points was observed at 3DPI. Using

354

quantitative immunofluorescence scanning microscopy, we evaluated the extent of lung area containing

355

both SARS-CoV-2 viral protein and infiltrating IBA1+ macrophages (Fig 7). In the SARS-CoV-2 + vehicle

356

group, staining for viral nucleocapsid protein indicated the peak of viral protein production at 3DPI, which

357

declined at both 5 and 7DPI (Fig 7A-E). Increased infiltration of macrophages was present at 3DPI, peaked

358

at 5DPI and was then followed by a decline at 7DPI (Fig 7A-E). Control animals (Fig 7S,T) showed no

359

staining for SARS-CoV-2 and only background levels of IBA1. Viral replication was decreased by

360

administration of 30mg/kg/day of PT150 (Fig 7G-L), and was further decreased by the administration of

361

100mg/kg/day of PT150 (Fig 7M-R). In parallel to the decrease in viral nucleocapsid protein, there was a

362

decrease in the percent of total lung area occupied by infiltrating macrophages at 30 and 100 mg/Kg/day

363

PT150 (Fig 7G-L,M-R). Quantification of immunofluorescence staining, as measured by the percent of

364

total sampled lung area positive for SARS-CoV-2, revealed marked decreases in both percent lung area

365

expressing viral replication, as well as the number of IBA1+ cells/mm2 (Fig 7U,V). This demonstrates a

366

dose-response relationship in therapeutic efficacy of PT150 for reducing the viral burden of SARS-CoV-2

367

in lung, as well as a corresponding decrease in the extent of infiltrating macrophages.

368

In Syrian golden hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2, there was a significant increase in

369

macrophage-derived IL-6 within the bronchiolar epithelial layer (Fig 8A-C). Immunofluorescence images

370

of infected hamster lung tissue at 3DPI revealed cells within the bronchiolar epithelial layer co-producing

371

high levels of IL-6 (green) with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (red). Nuclei were counterstained with

372

DAPI (blue) and IBA1+ macrophages are shown in cyan.

373

immunofluorescence images show cells staining intensely for IL-6 and co-localizing with expression of

374

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsids protein, adjacent to IBA1+ macrophages (Fig 8A and inset). Expression of

375

IL-6 persisted at 5 and 7DPI, even after SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was no longer evident (Fig

376

8B,C). Treatment with PT150 and 30 mg/Kg/day (Fig 8D-F) and 100 mg/Kg/day (Fig 8G-I) dramatically

377

decreased expression of IL-6, concordant with decreases in SARS-CoV-2 and in the presence of IBA1+

378

macrophages. Quantification of fluorescence data indicated differences between PT150-treated groups and

379

infected + vehicle groups at all timepoints (Treatment, p<0.0001, F(3,232)=14.71; Timepoint, p<0.0001,

380

F(2,232)=29.99), with the greatest differences evident at 3DPI, where both PT150-treated groups were

381

different from the SARS-CoV-2 + vehicle group, as well as from each other, indicating dose-dependent

382

effects on reduction of IL-6 in the bronchiolar epithelial layer of infected hamsters.

Discussion

385

Treatment options available for individuals that have SARS-CoV-2 continue to be limited. Of the

386

few treatments that are available, many are the result of repurposing efforts and have low efficacy and

387

limited experimental characterization about the direct mechanisms of action against SARS-CoV-2.

388

Therapeutic approaches have primarily focused on targeting viral proteins [31-33] or the host immune

389

response through corticosteroid administration, which can be detrimental if not administered during the

390

correct period of the infection [34]. However, less research has been published on molecules that have both

391

anti-viral activity as well as immunomodulatory activity to decrease the hyperinflammatory response to

17

392

SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mechanism of action of PT150 involves modulation of the glucocorticoid and

393

androgen receptors that inhibits viral entry and replication by decreasing expression of two main proteins

394

that the virus utilizes for endosomal uptake, TMPRSS2 and ACE2 [8, 35-40]. PT150 also modulates the

395

immune response likely through the glucocorticoid receptor, which is expressed in numerous immune cells

396

including macrophages, T cells, dendritic cells and epithelial cells [41, 42]. PT150 was administered orally

397

to animals infected with SARS-CoV-2, resulting in marked clinical and pathological improvements when

398

compared to the infected vehicle control group. Because Syrian hamsters can propagate human SARS-

399

CoV-2 and show a high degree of sequence homology in both AR and GR (Fig 4), it is likely that SARS-

400

CoV-2 infected patients will response similarly to PT150 treatment.

401

Clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection were observed in infected vehicle-only treated

402

animals as early 3DPI. Behavioral and physical changes were more prominent at the 5-day timepoint and

403

included labored breathing, ruffled fur, akinesia and maximal weight loss (5-10%). Weight loss observed

404

5DPI similar to other studies in Syrian hamsters [43-46]. Animals that received PT150 at clinically relevant

405

low (30mg/kg/day) and high (100mg/Kg/day) doses did not display as severe clinical manifestations and

406

weight loss was minimal at the 5-day timepoint, when compared to untreated control animals (Fig. 1).

407

Pathological analysis of infected lung tissue revealed inflammatory cellular infiltration involvement at

408

3DPI, of which peaked at 5DPI and included mixed inflammatory cell populations resulting in

409

bronchiointerstital pneumonia (Fig. 2). The majority of the parenchymal space at the 5-day timepoint was

410

reduced due to intense inflammatory cell infiltration and showed extravasating cells from pulmonary

411

vessels being recruited to the epithelial layers of the bronchi. The multifocal inflammation began to resolve

412

by 7DPI and was replaced with fibrotic lung tissue and consolidated areas of focal inflammation.

413

Inflammatory pathology within the treated animals was decreased in severity and showed marked

414

improvement within the parenchymal and alveolar spaces. High dose treatment tissue resembled that of

415

control with open alveolar interfaces and non-inflamed vessels.

416

Digital image analysis of whole-lung scans in the infected vehicle-only group (Fig 3) showed

417

extensive hypercellularity and bronchiointerstital pneumonia, with markedly increased hypercellularity in

18

418

bronchioles, pulmonary arteries and the lung parenchyma. Lung hypercellularity in infected animals

419

increased throughout the course of the 7-day study, similar to the progressive pneumonia experienced by

420

SARS-CoV-2 patients in response to the overwhelming amount of edema and cellular infiltration into the

421

parenchyma of the lungs. Treatment with PT150 markedly reduced hypercellularity at 5 and 7DPI, with the

422

low-dose PT150 group showing reduction at 7DPI. This indicates that PT150 may be regulating cellular

423

infiltration and recruitment into the lung tissue, resulting in reduced pathology and inflammation.

424

We performed phylogenetic analysis and molecular docking studies to characterize the putative

425

molecular targets by which PT150 could modulate disease progression (Fig 4). Sequence concordance

426

values for both AR and GR were very high across species representative of divergent taxonomic groups,

427

including the greater horseshoe bat, sunda pangolin, Syrian golden hamster and human (amongst other

428

species). This underscores not only the likely similar patterns of regulation of AR/GR-dependent genes

429

across species that are required for entry of SARS-CoV-2, such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but also the

430

predictive potential for therapeutic modulation of these receptors using PT150, given the sequence

431

similarity between the hamster and human genes. Similarity in these regulatory proteins also highlights the

432

potential for cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and related β-coronaviruses and the importance

433

of identifying compounds that can modulate signaling of AR and GR to increase host defense.

434

Molecular docking studies (Fig 4C,D) indicated likely interactions with the co-activator site of the

435

ligand binding domain of both receptors (shaded in green), rather than the steroid binding pocket (shaded

436

in magenta in each structure). Thus, PT150 may functions as an allosteric modulator of these receptors,

437

resulting in transcriptional repression of key genes, such as TMRPSS2 and ACE2 (required for viral entry),

438

as well as pro-inflammatory factors. Modeling was conducted using the published crystal structures for AR

439

(PDB: 2PIT) [22] and the glucocorticoid receptor (PDB: 3CLD), solved as a complex co-crystalized with

440

flutacasone [23]. PT150 did not bind the steroid site in any simulation and although the binding site has

441

some flexibility in both receptors, the stereochemistry of PT150 appears to hinder binding at this site. The

442

co-activator peptide binding site most favorably interacted with PT150, suggesting this as a site of allosteric

443

modulation that could inhibit transcriptional activity without directly competing for binding with

19

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.20.432110; this version posted February 22, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

444

endogenous corticosteroid ligands. This has been reported for small molecule modulators of other nuclear

445

receptors, such as NR4A2/Nurr1, where molecular docking studies indicated interactions at the co-activator

446

peptide binding site than correlated with transcriptional inhibition of inflammatory gene expression [47].

447

Studies published with the 1NHZ structure of GR co-crystalized with RU486 suggested potential

448

interactions within the steroid binding pocket of the LBD [48], but the helix that forms part of both the

449

steroid site and the co-activator peptide site was not complete in the 1NHZ structure due to a 9 amino acid

450

deletion, resulting in a distortion of the GR LBD that would be more permissive of interactions within the

451

steroid binding pocket. Thus, PT150 may modulate both AR and GR signaling as an allosteric inhibitor

452

through interactions with the co-activator domain, leading to decreased transcription of target genes.

453

The doses of PT150 administered in the in vivo studies in hamsters are highly comparable to the

454

calculated human doses in the proposed Phase II trial. Previous clinical steady-state exposure data in human

455

trials with 500 mg PT150 would yield a dose of approximately 7 mg/Kg. Compared to both rodent and dog,

456

human calculated exposures are significantly greater for a given dose, based on standard physiologic-based

457

pharmacokinetic models that account for differences in mass, body surface area (BSA), metabolism, half-

458

life, etc. [49]. Using scaling factors based on BSA (33), the doses used in the hamster study translate to a

459

Human Equivalent Dose (HED) of: HED = 30 mg/kg x 5/37 = 4.1 mg/kg; HED = 100 mg/kg x 5/37 = 13.5

460

mg/kg. Thus, 900 mg/day in patients would represent approximately 12.6 mg/Kg, which is very close to

461

the efficacious dose observed in hamsters treated with PT150.

462
463

To further investigate the molecular targets of PT150 in vivo, expression of ACE2 was determined

464

in lung in bronchiolar epithelial cells (Fig 5). ACE2 levles in untreated animals remained constant until

465

preaking at 7DPI. Co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 were observed in bronchiolar epithelial cells

466

at 3DPI and 5DPI, supporting that ACE2 is a vital component in viral binding and entry (Fig 5A-C). This

467

demonstrates that viral infectivity and replication may transcriptionally regulate ACE2 production in favor

468

of viral propagation and survival. Treatment with 100 mg/Kg PT150 decreased the overall amount of ACE2

469

in addition to reducing co-localization with SARS-CoV-2. This reduction of ACE2 could be due to

20

470

inhibition of androgen receptor binding to the promoter of Ace2, thereby decreasing transcriptional

471

activation, as reported for other anti-androgens [50]. Expression of TMPRSS2 was also investigated due to

472

the requirement of this cell surface serine protease for processing of the viral S1 spike protein that is

473

necessary for viral entry in complex with ACE2 (Fig 6). Protein levels of TMPRSS2 in infected vehicle-

474

only treated animals increased significantly at all timepoints, demonstrating transcriptional induction

475

favoring viral replication. However, the low-dose PT150 treatment decreased TMPRSS2 expression at 5

476

and 7DPI, whereas high-dose PT150 treatment decreased TMPRSS2 expression at all timepoints,

477

demonstrating a dose-response effect in modulating expression of TMPRSS2 in lung. Decreased production

478

of both TMPRSS2 and ACE2 suggests that PT150 is a transcriptional inhibitor of these genes that likely

479

prevents binding of co-activator proteins to the enhancer regions of TMPRSS2 [51] as well as ACE2 [50].

480

These data suggest that the anti-viral activity of PT150 is due to direct modulation of host defense that

481

decreases viral entry points.

482

To determine if PT150 was effective at reducing overall viral replication, infection and immune

483

responses, whole lung sections were analyzed and viral infectivity was determined by assessment of the

484

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (Fig 7). In untreated animals, there was a significant change from

485

control in the percentage of lung area infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 3DPI that decreased by 5DPI and 7DPI,

486

as seen in previously published studies [44, 52, 53]. Viral loads in animals administered PT150 at 100

487

mg/Kg were not different from control at 3DPI, demonstrating a dramatic reduction in viral attachment,

488

replication and dissemination throughout lung tissue, both in the bronchi and in the parenchyma.

489

Macrophage infiltration per area of tissue in untreated animals was increased at 3DPI and peaked at 5DPI,

490

with resolution occurring at the 7-day timepoint. Animals treated with the high dose of PT150 showed

491

significant decreases in invading macrophage populations at the 3-day timepoint and the low-dose PT150

492

group showed decreases at 5DPI, demonstrating a marked reductions in the severity of inflammatory

493

infiltration of macrophages.

494

IL-6 produced by activated macrophages is known to be a critical mediator of lung injury in

495

COVID19 patients [54]. This cytokine is responsible for recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells

21

496

and is closely associated with the hyperimmune response observed in patients characterized by severe

497

infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes into lung tissue. IL-6 production was investigated in the

498

bronchiolar cell layer to determine inflammatory recruitment potential during the course of disease (Fig 8).

499

Infected animals treated with vehicle showed peak IL-6 production at the 3DPI timepoint, decreasing

500

steadily to the 7-day timepoint. Interestingly, high and low dose PT150 treated groups showed highly

501

reduced levels of IL-6 at all timepoints. This highlights the efficacy of PT150 in reducing innate immune

502

responses concomitant to mitigating the severity of lung pathology in response to SARS-CoV-2.

503

In conclusion, these data demonstrate disease progression and pathology within the lungs of SARS-

504

CoV-2-infected animals depends upon production of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which facilitate viral entry

505

and replication, leading to recruitment of macrophages that initiate a severe innate immune response leading

506

to broncho-interstitial pneuomonia and consolidation of the lung parenchyma. Expression of IL-6 is

507

necessary for recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection, which leads to the ‘cytokine storm’ and

508

decreased prognosis for patients [55, 56]. PT150 treatment interrupts this progression of disease, limiting

509

viral entry, thereby reducing viral loads and decreasing the severity of the immune response to SARS-CoV-

510

2 infection. This may occur through allosteric inhibition of the androgen and glucocorticoid receptors,

511

which decreases protein levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and mitigates excessive immune responses through

512

inhibition of inflammatory gene expression. Importantly, decreased production of IL-6 production by

513

resident immune cells within the lung tissue is likely to correlate with an improve prognosis for patients.

514

The novel mechanism of action of PT150 as both an inhibitor of viral entry and an immunomodulator makes

515

it a strong candidate for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of COVID19 independent of SARS-CoV-

516

2 variants.
