Abstract
SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, is responsible for the current COVID-19 worldwide
pandemic. We previously demonstrated that five nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), including the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine,
Zidovudine, Tenofovir alafenamide and Emtricitabine. We report here the evaluation of a library of
additional nucleoside triphosphate analogues with a variety of structural and chemical features as
inhibitors of the RdRps of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These features include modifications on the
sugar (2’ or 3’ modifications, carbocyclic, acyclic, or dideoxynucleotides) or on the base. The goal is to
identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus
RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses’ exonuclease activity. We examined these
nucleotide analogues with regard to their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase
reaction and then prevent further incorporation. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6
exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (Carbovir triphosphate, Ganciclovir
triphosphate, Stavudine triphosphate, Entecavir triphosphate, 3’-O-methyl UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2
showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2’-O-methyl UTP), and 3 did not terminate the
polymerase reaction (2’-fluoro-dUTP, 2’-amino-dUTP and Desthiobiotin-16-UTP). The coronavirus
genomes encode an exonuclease that apparently requires a 2’-OH group to excise mismatched bases at the
3’-terminus. In this study, all of the nucleoside triphosphate analogues we evaluated form Watson-Cricklike base pairs. All the nucleotide analogues which demonstrated termination either lack a 2’-OH, have a
blocked 2’-OH, or show delayed termination. These nucleotides may thus have the potential to resist
exonuclease activity, a property that we will investigate in the future. Furthermore, prodrugs of five of
these nucleotide analogues (Brincidofovir/Cidofovir, Abacavir, Valganciclovir/Ganciclovir, Stavudine
and Entecavir) are FDA approved for other viral infections, and their safety profile is well known. Thus,
they can be evaluated rapidly as potential therapies for COVID-19.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, continues to have a devastating global impact.
SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily (Zhu et al. 2020). Coronaviruses, HCV
and the flaviviruses are all positive-sense single-strand RNA viruses that replicate their genomes using an
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) catalyzed reaction (Zumla et al. 2016; Dustin et al. 2016).
Currently, there are no FDA approved antiviral drugs for the treatment of human coronavirus infections,
including COVID-19. The RdRp of coronaviruses is a well established drug target; the active site of the
RdRp is highly conserved among positive-sense RNA viruses (te Velthuis 2014). These RdRps have low
fidelity (Selisko et al. 2018), allowing them to recognize a variety of modified nucleotide analogues as
substrates. Such nucleotide analogues may inhibit further RNA-polymerase catalyzed RNA replication
making them important candidate anti-viral agents (McKenna et al. 1989; Öberg 2006; Eltahla et al. 2015;
De Clercq and Li 2016). RdRps in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have nearly identical sequences (Elfiky
2020); recently, the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp was cloned (Chien et al. 2020) and the RNA polymerase
complex structure was determined (Gao et al. 2020), which will help guide the design and study of RdRp
inhibitors.
Remdesivir, a phosphoramidate prodrug containing a 1’-cyano modification on the sugar, is converted
in cells into an adenosine triphosphate analogue, which has been shown to be an inhibitor of the RdRp of
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Gordon et al. 2020a; 2020b). It is currently in clinical trials in several
countries as a therapeutic for COVID-19 infections. Remdesivir triphosphate has been shown to be
incorporated with higher efficiency than ATP by coronavirus RdRps; it shows delayed termination which
could help to overcome excision by the viral exonuclease (Gordon et al. 2020a; 2020b). β-D-N4hydroxycytidine is another prodrug targeting the polymerase and has been shown to have broad spectrum
activity against coronaviruses, even in the presence of intact proofreading functions (Agostini et al. 2019,
Sheahan et al. 2020).
1.1. Selection of candidate nucleoside triphosphates for Coronavirus polymerase testing
We previously demonstrated that five nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRp), including the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, Zidovudine,
Tenofovir alafenamide and Emtricitabine (Ju et al. 2020; Chien et al. 2020; Jockusch et al. 2020).
Emtricitabine and Tenofovir alafenamide are used in FDA approved combination regimens for treatment
of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections as well as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to
prevent HIV infections (Anderson et al. 2011), and may be evaluated for PrEP for COVID-19 (Jockusch
et al. 2020).
The fact that all of the previous five nucleotide analogues exhibited inhibition of the coronavirus
polymerases indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp can accept a variety of nucleotide analogues as
substrates. In this work, we evaluate additional nucleotide analogues with a larger variety of
modifications to identify those with more efficient termination, as well as the ability to resist the virus’s
proofreading function. These additional nucleotide analogues were selected based on one or more of the
following criteria. First, they have structural and chemical properties such as (a) similarity in size and
structure to natural nucleotides, including the ability to fit within the active site of the polymerase, (b)
presence of modifications at the 3’-OH position or absence of a 3’-OH group resulting in obligate
termination of the polymerase reaction; or (c) modifications at the 2’ or other positions on the sugar or

base that can delay termination. The above criteria will provide structural and chemical features that we
can explore to evade exonuclease activity (Minskaia et al. 2006). Second, if they have previously been
shown to inhibit the polymerases of other viruses, they may also have the potential to inhibit the SARSCoV-2 polymerase based on our previous work. Third, ideally, the inhibitors should display high
selectivity for viral polymerases relative to cellular DNA or RNA polymerases. And fourth, there is an
advantage in considering nucleotide analogues that are the active triphosphate forms of FDA-approved
drugs, as these drugs are known to have acceptable levels of toxicity and are more likely to be tolerated
by patients with coronavirus infections, including COVID-19.
Using the above selection criteria, here we examine 11 nucleotide analogues with sugar or base
modifications (structures shown in Fig. 1) for their ability to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV
RdRps: Ganciclovir 5’-triphosphate, Carbovir 5’-triphosphate, Cidofovir diphosphate, Stavudine 5’triphosphate, Entecavir 5’-triphosphate, 2’-O-methyluridine-5’-triphosphate, 3’-O-methyluridine-5’triphosphate,
2’-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine-5’-triphosphate,
desthiobiotin-16-aminoallyl-2’-uridine-5’triphosphate, biotin-16-aminoallyl-2’-deoxyuridine-5’-triphosphate, and 2’-aminouridine-5’-triphosphate.
The nucleoside and prodrug forms for the FDA approved drugs are shown in Fig. 2, and nucleoside and
potential prodrug forms for three of the others are shown in Fig. S1.
Some of the uridine analogues listed above have been investigated as inhibitors of viral polymerases
(Kumaki et al. 2011; Eyer et al. 2019; Arup et al. 1992; Lauridsen et al. 2012). The 2’-O-methyluridine
triphosphate is of particular interest, since it has been demonstrated that 2’-O-methyl nucleotides are
resistant to removal by the 3’-exonuclease found in coronaviruses (Minskaia et al. 2006). Next, we briefly
describe 5 nucleotide analogues whose prodrug forms have been FDA approved for other virus infections.
Ganciclovir triphosphate (Gan-TP) is an acyclic guanosine nucleotide (Fig. 1). The parent nucleoside
Ganciclovir (Cytovene, Fig. 2) is used to treat AIDS-related cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. The drug
can inhibit herpesviruses including herpesvirus 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus and CMV in vitro and in
vivo. The valyl ester prodrug Valganciclovir (Fig. 2) can be given orally. After cleavage of the valyl ester,
Ganciclovir is converted to Ganciclovir triphosphate by viral and cellular enzymes (Matthews and
Boehme 1988; Akyürek et al. 2001).
Carbovir triphosphate (Car-TP) is a carbocyclic guanosine didehydro-dideoxynucleotide (Fig. 1). The
parent prodrug is Abacavir (Ziagen, Fig. 2), which is an FDA approved nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitor for HIV/AIDS treatment (Faletto et al. 1997; Ray et al. 2002). It is taken orally and is well
tolerated.
Cidofovir diphosphate (Cid-DP) is an acyclic cytidine nucleotide (Fig. 1). Its prodrug form Cidofovir
(Vistide, Fig. 2) has been FDA approved for the intravenous treatment of AIDS-related CMV retinitis,
and has been used off-label for a variety of DNA virus infections (De Clercq 2002; Lanier et al. 2010).
The parent prodrug Brincidofovir (BDV, Fig. 2) is an oral antiviral drug candidate for treating smallpox
infections. It has a lipid moiety masking the phosphate group, is taken up well by cells, has low toxicity,
and is active against a wide range of DNA viruses in animals, including poxviruses, adenoviruses,
herpesviruses, and CMV (Trost et al. 2015; Cundy et al. 1999). Interestingly, it has been shown using
vaccinia virus DNA polymerase, that though Cid-DP is incorporated into DNA in the polymerase reaction,
the process is relatively inefficient, and termination of synthesis occurs after extension by an additional
nucleotide, a delayed termination similar to that shown for Remdesivir for RdRp; in the penultimate
position, the incorporated Cidofovir is not removed by 3’-exonuclease activity and resistance is not
common for Cidofovir (Magee et al. 2005).

Stavudine triphosphate (Fig. 1), a thymidine analogue, is the active triphosphate form of Stavudine
(d4T, Zerit, Fig. 2), an antiviral used for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS (Ho and Hitchcock
1989). It preferentially inhibits the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) (Huang et al. 1992). The lack of a 3’OH group makes it an obligate inhibitor.
Entecavir triphosphate (Ent-TP, Fig. 1), the active triphosphate form of the orally available drug
Entecavir (Baraclude, Fig. 2), is a guanosine nucleotide inhibitor of the HBV RT (Matthews 2006,
Rivkina and Rybalow 2002). It shows little if any inhibition of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA
polymerases (Mazzucco et al. 2008), and has generally been shown to have low toxicity. It has been
shown that Entecavir triphosphate is a delayed chain terminator with the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase,
making it resistant to excision by exonucleases (Tchesnokov et al. 2008).
We reasoned that once the above nucleotide analogues are incorporated into an RNA primer in the
polymerase reaction, the fact that they either lack a normal sugar ring configuration or lack the 2’- and/or
3’-OH groups, would make it unlikely for them to be recognized by 3’-exonucleases involved in SARSCoV-2 proofreading processes, decreasing the likelihood of developing resistance to inhibition by the
drug.
1.2. Coronaviruses have a proofreading exonuclease activity that must be overcome to develop effective
RdRp nucleotide inhibitors
In contrast to many other RNA viruses, the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses have very
large genomes that encode a 3’-5’ exonuclease (nsp14) involved in proofreading (Shannon et al. 2020;
Ma et al. 2015), the activity of which is enhanced by the cofactor nsp10 (Bouvet et al. 2012). This
proofreading function increases replication fidelity by removing mismatched nucleotides (Ferron et al.
2018). Mutations in nsp14 lead to reduced replication fidelity of the viral genome (Eckerle et al. 2010).
Interestingly, while the nsp14/nsp10 complex efficiently excises single mismatched nucleotides at the 3’
end of the RNA chain, it is not able to remove longer stretches of unpaired nucleotides or 3’ modified
RNA (Bouvet et al. 2012). In order for the nucleotide analogues to be successful inhibitors of these
viruses, they need to overcome this proofreading function. The coronavirus exonuclease activity typically
requires the presence of a 2’-OH group at the 3’ end of the growing RNA strand (Minskaia et al. 2006).
However, if there is delayed termination and the offending nucleotide analogue is no longer at the 3’ end,
they will also not be removed by the exonuclease (Bouvet et al. 2012; Gordon et al. 2020a; 2020b).
Nearly all of the nucleotide analogues we selected lack the 2’-OH group, have modifications that block
the 2’-OH group on the sugar, or are acyclic nucleotide derivatives; such nucleotides will not likely be
substrates for viral exonucleases.

The primer and template (sequences shown in Figs. 2-4, S2-S8) were annealed by heating to 70°C for
10 min and cooling to room temperature in 1x reaction buffer. The RNA polymerase mixture consisting
of 6 µM nsp12 and 18 µM each of cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 (Chien et al. 2020) was incubated for 15 min
at room temperature in a 1:3:3 ratio in 1x reaction buffer. Then 5 µl of the annealed template primer
solution containing 2 µM template and 1.7 µM primer in 1x reaction buffer was added to 10 µl of the

3. Results and Discussion
We tested the ability of the active triphosphate forms of the nucleotide analogues (structures shown in
Fig. 1) to be incorporated by the RdRps of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. The prodrugs of these molecules
are shown in Figs. 2 and S1. The phosphoramidate forms of prodrugs can be readily synthesized using the
ProTide approach (Alanazi et al. 2019). The RdRp of these coronaviruses, referred to as nsp12, and its
two protein cofactors, nsp7 and nsp8, have been shown to be required for the processive polymerase
activity of nsp12 in SARS-CoV (Subissi et al. 2014; Kirchdoerfer and Ward 2019). These three
components of each coronavirus polymerase complex were cloned and purified as described previously
(Kirchdoerfer and Ward 2019; Chien et al. 2020). We then performed polymerase extension assays with
2’-O-methyluridine triphosphate (2’-OMe-UTP), 3’-O-methyluridine 5’-triphosphate (3’-OMe-UTP), 2’fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine triphosphate (2’-F-dUTP), 2’-amino-2’-deoxyuridine triphosphate (2’-NH2-dUTP),
biotin-16-dUTP (Biotin-UTP), desthiobiotin-16-UTP (DBiotin-UTP), Stavudine-TP (Sta-TP), Cidofovir
diphosphate (Cid-DP) + UTP + ATP, Carbovir triphosphate (Car-TP) + UTP + ATP + CTP, Ganciclovir
5’-triphosphate (Gan-TP) + UTP + ATP + CTP, or Entecavir triphosphate (Ent-TP) + UTP + ATP + CTP,
following the addition of a pre-annealed RNA template and primer to a pre-assembled mixture of the
SARS-CoV and/or SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (nsp12) and the two cofactor proteins (nsp7 and nsp8). We also
used combinations of nucleotide analogues in some cases to perform the polymerase reaction. The
polymerase reaction products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. The sequences of the RNA template
and primer used for the polymerase extension assay, which correspond to the 3’ end of the SARS-CoV-2
genome, are indicated at the top of Figs. 3-5 and S2-S8.
In the case of the UTP and TTP analogues, because there are two A’s in a row in the next available
positions of the template for RNA polymerase extension downstream of the priming site, if they are
indeed terminators of the polymerase reaction, the extension should stop after incorporating one
nucleotide analogue. If they do not serve as terminators, two base extension by the UTP or TTP analogue
will be observed. In the case of Cid-DP which is a CTP analogue, UTP and ATP must be provided to
allow extension to the point where there is a G in the template strand. If the Cid-DP is then incorporated
and acts as a terminator, extension will stop; otherwise, additional incorporation events may be observed.
Similarly, for Carbovir-TP, Ganciclovir-TP, and Entecavir-TP, all of which are GTP analogues, UTP,
ATP and CTP must be provided to allow extension to the point where there is a C in the template strand.
If Car-TP, Gan-TP or Ent-TP is incorporated and acts as a terminator, extension will stop; otherwise
additional incorporation events may be observed. Guided by polymerase extension results we obtained
previously for the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, AZT, Tenofovir-DP and
Emtricitabine-TP (Ju et al. 2020; Chien et al. 2020; Jockusch et al. 2020), various ratios of the nucleotides
were chosen in the current work.
The results of the MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the primer extension reactions are shown in Figs. 3-5
and S2-S8. The observed peaks generally fit the nucleotide incorporation patterns described above;
however, additional peaks assigned to intermediate stages of the extension reaction and in some cases
extension beyond the incorporation of the nucleotide analogue was also observed. We describe the results
for the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase catalyzed reaction in detail; similar results were obtained for the subset
of nucleotide analogues tested with the SARS-CoV RdRp and are shown in the Supplementary Material.

Fig. 3. Incorporation of 2’-OMe-UTP, Sta-TP and Biotin-dUTP by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp to terminate
the polymerase reaction. The sequences of the primer and template used for this extension reaction,
which are at the 3’ end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, are shown at the top of the figure. Polymerase
extension reactions were performed by incubating 2’-OMe-UTP (a), Sta-TP (b) and Biotin-dUTP (c) with
pre-assembled SARS-CoV-2 polymerase (nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8), the indicated RNA template and primer,
and the appropriate reaction buffer, followed by detection of reaction products by MALDI-TOF MS. The
detailed procedure is shown in the Methods section. The accuracy for m/z determination is ± 10 Da.

The results for 2’-OMe-UTP, Sta-TP (which is a T analog) and Biotin-dUTP are presented in Fig. 3. In
the case of extension with 2’-OMe-UTP, MS peaks representing incorporation by one 2’-OMe-UTP
(6638 Da observed, 6632 Da expected) and to a lesser extent two 2’-OMe-UTPs (6944 Da observed, 6952
Da expected) were observed. Thus, 2’-OMe-UTP shows significant termination upon incorporation,
indicating it can be a potential drug lead. 2’-O-methyl modification of RNA occurs naturally and
therefore should have relatively low toxicity. In addition, ribose-2’-O-methylated RNA resists viral
exonuclease activity (Minskaia et al. 2006). For Sta-TP, a single incorporation peak (6603 Da observed,
6598 Da expected) was seen, indicating that Sta-TP is very efficiently incorporated and achieves
complete termination of the polymerase reaction. Since this molecule is a dideoxynucleotide without any
hydroxyl groups on the sugar moiety, it may resist exonuclease activity. In the case of Biotin-dUTP, a
single incorporation peak was evident (7090 Da observed, 7082 Da expected), suggesting that BiotindUTP is also a terminator of the polymerase reaction under these conditions. This indicates that the
presence of a modification on the base along with the absence of a 2’-OH group in this nucleotide
analogue leads to termination of the polymerase reaction catalyzed by the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.

Fig. 4. Incorporation of Cid-DP by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp to terminate the polymerase reaction. The
sequences of the primer and template used for this extension reaction are shown at the top of the figure.
The polymerase extension reaction was performed by incubating Cid-DP, UTP and ATP with preassembled SARS-CoV-2 polymerase (nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8), the indicated RNA template and primer,
and the appropriate reaction buffer, followed by detection of reaction products by MALDI-TOF MS. The
detailed procedure is shown in the Methods section. The accuracy for m/z determination is ± 10 Da.

The result for the CTP analogue Cid-DP, which has an OH group, is presented in Fig. 4. Major peaks
were observed indicating incorporation of a Cid-DP at the 8th position from the initial priming site (8813
Da observed, 8807 Da expected) and a further 2 base extension by one ATP followed by one Cid-DP at
the 10th position (9404 Da observed, 9397 Da expected). There is no further extension beyond this
position, indicative of delayed termination by Cid-DP. A small intermediate peak was also observed
indicating extension by an ATP at the 9th position from the initial priming site following the first Cid-DP
incorporation (9142 Da observed, 9138 Da expected). A small partial UTP extension peak (6623 Da
observed, 6618 Da expected) was also observed. An essentially identical result was obtained with the
SARS-CoV polymerase (Fig. S2). Delayed termination for Cid-DP has been described for a vaccinia
virus DNA polymerase (Magee et al. 2005). The investigational drug Remdesivir, currently being tested
on COVID-19 patients, also displays delayed termination (Gordon et al. 2020a; 2020b); this is a major
10

factor in its ability to resist the nsp14 3’-5’ exonuclease activity. Similar resistance to this exonuclease
therefore will likely also occur with Cidofovir due to delayed termination of the polymerase reaction.
Based on these results, Cidofovir and the oral prodrug Brincidofovir are thus potential leads for COVID19 and SARS.

Fig. 5. Incorporation of Car-TP, Ent-TP and Gan-TP by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp to terminate the
polymerase reaction. The sequences of the primer and template used for this extension reaction are
shown at the top of the figure. Polymerase extension reactions were performed by incubating Car-TP,
UTP, ATP and CTP (a), Ent-TP, UTP, ATP and CTP (b), and Gan-TP, UTP, ATP and CTP (c) with preassembled SARS-CoV-2 polymerase (nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8), the indicated RNA template and primer,
and the appropriate reaction buffer, followed by detection of reaction products by MALDI-TOF MS. The
detailed procedure is shown in the Methods section. The accuracy for m/z determination is ± 10 Da.

The results for the GTP analogues, Car-TP, Ent-TP and Gan-TP are presented in Fig. 5. In each case,
extension to the first C position on the template occurs and further extension is blocked in the presence of
ATP, UTP and CTP. In more detail, for Car-TP, the major peak observed indicates extension by UTP,
ATP and CTP followed by complete termination with a Car-TP (10436 Da observed, 10430 Da expected).
In addition, partial extension peaks were seen indicating a single UTP incorporation (6621 Da observed,
6618 Da expected) and extension up to but not including the Car-TP (10123 Da observed, 10121 Da
expected). For Ent-TP, a peak was observed indicating extension by UTP, ATP and CTP followed by
complete termination by a single Ent-TP (10458 Da observed, 10460 Da expected). Additional peaks are
11

12000
m /z

seen representing a single UTP extension (6628 Da observed, 6618 Da expected), and a major peak
indicating extension up to but not including the Ent-TP (10129 Da observed, 10121 Da expected). And
for Gan-TP, a major peak observed indicated extension by UTP, ATP and CTP followed by complete
termination with Gan-TP (10441 Da observed, 10438 Da expected). A small peak representing extension
up to but not including Gan-TP (10123 Da observed, 10121 Da expected) was also seen. Similar results
were obtained for Car-TP and Gan-TP using the SARS-CoV polymerase (Fig. S3). Both Car-TP and EntTP are carbocyclic nucleotides. Car-TP lacks the 2’- and 3’-OH groups, while Ent-TP lacks the 2’-OH
group. Gan-TP is an acyclic nucleotide having an OH group but lacking a ribose ring. All three thus may
resist the viral exonuclease activity. These results also indicate that Car-TP and Gan-TP are better
terminators than Ent-TP; their prodrugs can be evaluated as therapeutics for COVID-19 and SARS.
Fig. S4 shows a side-by-side comparison of the results with 2’-OMe-UTP and 3’-OMe-UTP using the
SARS-CoV polymerase. The results for 2’-OMe-UTP are practically identical to those with SARS-CoV-2
in Fig. 4a, indicating that 2’-OMe-UTP exhibits significant polymerase reaction termination. The 3’OMe-UTP results are consistent with its being an obligate terminator, but with lower incorporation
efficiency, represented by a small single-incorporation peak (6625 Da observed, 6632 Da expected).
In Fig. S5, the results are shown for incorporation of 2’-F-dUTP by SARS-CoV RdRp. 2’-F-dUTP was
incorporated very efficiently, but also was incorporated opposite the Us in the template strand. This
apparent mismatch incorporation may be due to the high concentration of nucleotide analogues used and
the relatively low fidelity of SARS-CoV RdRp.
The results for DBiotin-UTP are presented in Fig. S6. DBiotin-UTP incorporation complementary to
each A in the template is observed, just like a UTP. Thus, this nucleotide is incorporated and does not
terminate the polymerase reaction. These results indicate that modification on the base of the UTP does
not affect its incorporation activity by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.
Fig. S7 presents the results of an experiment where both 2’-OMe-UTP and dUTP were added together
at the same concentration. The major peak occurred at 6930 Da (6922 Da expected) representing
incorporation by both dUTP and 2’-OMe-UTP in adjacent positions. In addition, some partial extension
peaks of a single 2’-OMe-UTP (6626 Da observed, 6632 Da expected) and two dUTPs (6900 Da
observed, 6892 Da expected) were found. The incorporation of a dUTP, a 2’-OMe-UTP, both of which
lack a 2’-OH group, or their combination would enable them to potentially resist the nsp14 3’-5’
exonuclease activity.
Fig. S8 shows three mass spectra of the polymerase reaction products using equimolar combinations of
nucleotide analogues, (a) biotin-dUTP, dUTP, and UTP, (b) 2’-F-dUTP, 2’-OMe-UTP and dUTP, and (c)
2’-NH2-dUTP, 2’-OMe-UTP and dUTP, to determine their relative incorporation efficiencies. Based on
the results shown in Fig. S8a, biotin-dUTP and dUTP have lower incorporation efficiency than the natural
UTP for SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, since peaks are only observed for UTP extension, either one UTP (6620 Da
observed, 6618 Da expected) or two UTPs (6928 Da observed, 6924 Da expected). In Fig. S8b, it is seen
that 2’-F-dUTP is incorporated far better than 2’-OMe-UTP and dUTP, with the only evident peaks in the
spectrum at 6620 Da (6620 Da expected) for extension by one 2’-F-dUTP, and at 6928 Da (6928 Da
expected) for extension by two 2’-F-dUTPs. Finally, as shown in Fig. S8c, 2’-NH2-dUTP is more
efficiently incorporated than 2’-OMe-UTP and dUTP as revealed by the presence of evident peaks only at
6623 Da (6617 Da expected) for extension by one 2’-NH2-dUTP and at 6929 Da (6922 Da expected) for
extension by two 2’-NH2-dUTPs. The results indicate that 2’-F-dUTP and 2’-NH2-dUTP behave like UTP,
and are not terminators of the polymerase reaction. Neither 2’-F-dUTP nor 2’-NH2-dUTP have a free 2’OH group. It remains to be seen whether the RNAs produced by these two nucleotide analogues will
12

resist exonuclease activity. If that is the case, they may be considered for use in combination with
nucleotide analogues that are efficient terminators but sensitive to exonuclease for COVID-19 therapeutic
purposes.
In summary, these results demonstrate that the library of nucleotide analogues we tested could be
incorporated by the RdRps of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Six of these nucleotide analogues exhibited
complete termination of the polymerase reaction (3’-OMe-UTP, Car-TP, Gan-TP, Sta-TP, Ent-TP,
Biotin-dUTP), two showed incomplete or delayed termination (2’-OMe-UTP, Cid-DP), and 3 did not
terminate the polymerase reaction (2’-F-dUTP, 2’-NH2-dUTP and DBiotin-UTP) using the RdRp of
SARS-CoV and/or SARS-CoV-2. Their prodrug versions (shown in Fig. 2 and S1) are available or can be
readily synthesized using the ProTide approach (Alanazi et al. 2019). The prodrugs of several of these
nucleoside triphosphate analogues (Ganciclovir/Valganciclovir, Cidofovir/Brincidofovir, Abacavir,
Stavudine, and Entecavir) have been FDA approved for treatment of other viral infections and their
toxicity profile is well established. Thus, our results provide a molecular basis for further evaluation of
these prodrugs in SARS-CoV-2 virus inhibition and animal models to test their efficacy for the
development of potential COVID-19 therapeutics. To reduce drug resistance, it would be useful to test
them in combination protocols.
