Abstract
Infecting large portions of the global population, seasonal influenza is a major burden
on societies around the globe. While the global source sink dynamics of the different
seasonal influenza viruses have been studied intensively, it’s local spread remains less
clear. In order to improve our understanding of how influenza is transmitted on a city
scale, we collected an extremely densely sampled set of influenza sequences alongside
patient metadata. To do so, we sequenced influenza viruses isolated from patients of
two different hospitals, as well as private practitioners in Basel, Switzerland during the
2016/2017 influenza season. The genetic sequences reveal that repeated introductions
into the city drove the influenza season. We then reconstruct how the effective
reproduction number changed over the course of the season. We find trends in
transmission dynamics correlated positively with trends in temperature, but not relative
humidity nor school holidays. Alongside the genetic sequence data that allows us to see
how individual cases are connected, we gathered patient information, such as the age or
household status. Zooming into the local transmission outbreaks suggests that the

elderly were to a large extent infected within their own transmission network, while
school children likely drove the spread within the remaining transmission network.
These patterns will be valuable to plan interventions combating the spread of
respiratory diseases within cities given that similar patterns are observed for other
influenza seasons and cities.

Author summary
As shown with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, respiratory diseases can quickly
spread around the globe. While it can be hugely important to understand how diseases
spread around the globe, local spread is most often the main driver of novel infections of
respiratory diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 or influenza. We here use genetic sequence
data alongside patient information to better understand what the drives the local
spread of influenza by looking at the 2016/2017 influenza season in Basel, Switzerland
as an example. The genetic sequence data allows us to reconstruct the how the
transmission dynamics changed over the course of the season, which we correlate to
changes, but not humidity or school holidays. Additionally, the genetic sequence data
allows us to see how individual cases are connected. Using patient information, such as
age and household status our analyses suggest that the elderly mainly transmit within
their own transmission network. Additionally, they suggest that school aged children,
but not pre-school aged children are important drivers of the local spread of influenza.

Introduction

1

With a large fraction of the population being infected annually and up to 650,000
deaths per year, seasonal influenza causes a major burden on societies around the globe
(https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/influenza-(seasonal)). Through
rapid evolution, influenza strains evade host immunity, allowing them to reinfect large
fractions of a population every year. In order to prevent infections, limited public health
resources have to be streamlined as efficiently as possible [1]. The planning of
interventions is dependent upon knowledge of the dynamics of epidemic spread of
influenza viruses in a city environment, which includes understanding the drivers of the
spread of seasonal influenza between individuals. Incidence and prevalence data can be
used to some extent to infer such dynamics. However, they lack the information about
how individual cases are epidemiologically related.
Phylogenetics allows us to see how individual cases are epidemiologically connected.
This is done by reconstructing the evolutionary relationship between temporally spaced
samples of genetic sequence data, isolated from different infected individuals. The
resulting phylogenetic tree displays how samples are related to each other, and branch
lengths in calendar time display the elapsed time. The phylogenetic tree can therefore
be interpreted as an approximation of the transmission chain of the sampled cases. Such
a view on part of the influenza transmission chain allows to further quantify the
epidemiological dynamics which gave rise to the observed phylogenetic tree using
phylodynamic methods [2]. Phylogenetics and phylodynamics thus allows us to
elucidate past epidemiological dynamics [3, 4] or to infer migration patterns [5, 6].
Several studies have used phylogenetic approaches to study how influenza and its
subtypes spread globally [7–11]. On an intermediate scale, college campuses have been
studied by using phylogenetics, revealing extensive mixing of influenza strains [12]. On
the smallest scale, studies have been performed to investigate person-to-person
transmission of influenza in households [13]. There is however a gap in studies that seek
to describe transmission of influenza on a city scale. In contrast to college campuses,

cities constitute highly heterogeneous societies with various different living
arrangements and vastly different social and age groups. This means that lessons learnt
about influenza transmission from college campuses are not necessarily transferable to
cities. Children have, for example, been described to make up a larger portion of the
infected population at the beginning of a season compared to the end over 3 seasons in
Houston [14].
In an effort to fill that gap, we studied the local spread of influenza and the factors
contributing to it in the city of Basel, Switzerland during the 2016/2017 Influenza
season which was dominated by Influenza A/H3N2. To do so, influenza samples
together with the age and residential address were collected from around 669 patients
from the University Hospital (USB), the Children’s Hospital of Basel (UKBB) and
patients of private practices from around the city. Around 200 of these patients also
provided additional information through filling out a survey. The survey asked
questions about family status, financial status, and demographics. Details on the data
collection is provided in [15]. We assess here the importance of introductions of
influenza into a city for seeding a seasonal epidemic, the overall dynamics of
transmission throughout the season, and the extent to which different age groups and
family statuses drive the spread of seasonal influenza in a city.

Data collection and sequencing

We collected all data in the 2016/17 influenza season as described in [15]. Sequencing
was performed as described in [16]. Raw Illumina reads were trimmed with
Trimmomatic 0.36 [17]. Alignment of paired-end reads was done by using bowtie
2.2.3 [18], using strain A/New York/18/2014 as a reference. The aligned reads were
sorted by using samtools 1.2 [19]. Variants were called and filtered by using lofreq
2.1.2 [20]. Variant calling was done for sites with a coverage of at least 100. Sites with a
coverage of less than 100 were assumed to be unknown and were denoted as N, that is
any possible nucleotide (Details on the exclusion of sequences are described in the
supplement). Exact input specification can be found at
https://github.com/nicfel/FluBaselPhylo/tree/master/Sequences. The consensus
sequences from this study were deposited in GenBank (numbers MN299375-MN304713).

We combined the Basel sequences with all sequences (as of the 17th of Juli 2018) from
https://www.gisaid.org sampled between January 1st 2016 and December 31st 2017 for
which at least the segments HA, NA and MP were available. We first aligned all
consensus sequences using muscle v3.8.3129. We then built an initial phylogeny from
the HA segment alone by using RaxML 8.2.1 [21] and obtained branch lengths in
calendar time via timetree [22] using the nextstrain pipeline [23].

We then calculated the average nucleotide difference between any of the sequences and

grouped any two sequences from Basel together if they were within an average
nucleotide difference of 0.0025 per position. If the full genome for two sequences was
available, this would correspond to about 32 different positions on the full genome. For
an average clock rate of 2.9*10-3 per site and year, this would correspond to a pairwise

phylogenetic distance of just below 1 year. Sets of sequences from Basel are only split
into two groups if the two closest related sequences of each group exceeds this distance.
Based on this initial grouping, we added sequences that were not from Basel to each
cluster if they were at maximum 0.0025/2 mutations per position away from any of the
sequences from Basel. The factor of 2 is only to reduce the number of non-Basel
sequences in each of these initial clusters.

We next estimated rates of evolution for each genomic segment using the SRD06
model [24] and a strict clock model from 200 full genome sequences sampled in
California, New York and Europe between 2010 and 2015 in Beast 2.5 [25]. These
sequences were downloaded from fludb.org, were not used otherwise and are an
independent dataset. We allowed each segment to have its own phylogeny in order to
avoid reassortment to bias the estimates of evolutionary rates. Each of the segments, as
well as the first two and third codon position was allowed to have its own rate scaler.
We ran 10 independent MCMC chains each for 108 iterations and then combined them
after a burn-in of 10%. These estimated evolutionary rates are long-term rates of
influenza A/H3N2. Since the effects of selection over short time periods are smaller
compared to longer time periods. The evolutionary rates can be expected to be faster
for shorter time windows [26]. We therefore expect the pairwise distances estimated for
our data from the 2016/17 outbreak using these rates to be an overestimate of the
actual divergence times. The xml and log files for the analysis can be found here
https://github.com/nicfel/FluBaselPhylo/tree/master/EvolutionaryRates.
We next reconstructed the phylogenetic trees of all initial clusters by using the full
genomes of all samples in the initial clusters. We fixed the evolutionary rates to be
equal to the mean evolutionary rates as estimated previously, with the mean
evolutionary rate being 2.9 ∗ 10− 3 per site and year. As a population prior, we used a
constant coalescent model with an effective population size being shared among all
initial clusters. We then estimated a distribution of phylogenies for each initial cluster,
assuming that all segments share the same phylogeny. If reassortment happened, it
would increase the distance between samples. Due to using fixed evolutionary rates as
estimated in the previous analysis, reassortment will not bias evolutionary rates. Hence,
reassortment events will increase the pairwise distance between isolates separated by
reassortment, but will not bias the distance between isolates that are not.

To identify sets of sequences from Basel that were likely transmitted locally, we used the
phylogenetic tree distributions for each initial cluster and reconstructed the ancestral
states using parsimony. We made some modifications to the standard algorithm for
ancestral state reconstruction. To reflect our prior belief that Basel is unlikely to act as
a relevant source of influenza on a global scale, we classified internal nodes that are not
exclusively classified to be in Basel as not in Basel. Since the flu season is only a few
months long, we additionally assumed that lineages are unlikely to persist in Basel for
more than 0.1 years without being sampled. To reflect that assumption, we classified
internal nodes that are more than 0.1 years from a sample from Basel to be either in a
location other than Basel, or to be in an unknown location. We then defined sequences
to be in the same local cluster if all their ancestors are inferred to be in Basel. We get
these local clusters for each iteration of the MCMC. The exact workflow, including
BEAST2 input files can be found at
https://github.com/nicfel/FluBaselPhylo/tree/master/LocalClusterss. While
alternative model based approaches exist to reconstruct locations of internal nodes

(e.g. [27]), these approaches themselves make strict assumptions that are violated when
studying the spread of diseases on a city scale. Also, it is further unknown how well
they perform when migration between individual locations is very strong.
From the grouping of sequences into local clusters as described above, sequences can
be classified into different local clusters over the course of the MCMC. For the
estimation of effective reproduction rates we however require each sequence to be in a
distinct local clusters. To do so, we randomly picked an iteration of the MCMC and
then chose the local clusters present in that iteration. In order to avoid sensitivity of
the results to the iteration we chose, we repeated each analysis 10 times with randomly
chosen iterations.

Estimation of the effective reproduction number and sampling
probability
We then estimated the effective reproduction number through time as well as the
sampling proportions and phylogenies from all these local clusters jointly using
BDSKY [28]. We assumed the effective reproduction number to be piecewise constant
in intervals of 2 days and allowed it to change every 2 days. We then assumed the
difference between the log effective reproduction number in interval t (log Ref f (t)) and
in interval t-1 (log Ref f (t-1)) to be distributed around N(0,σ), with σ being estimated
in the MCMC [29]. Additionally, we assume the log Ref f at the most recent time
interval and the one at the very last time interval to be normally distributed in log
space around N(-0.6931,0.1). This adapted version of BDSKY is available on
https://github.com/nicfel/bdsky. We assumed the rate at which an infected individual
transitions to being non-infectious to be 0.25 per day. Since we followed the same
procedure for inclusion of patients throughout the epidemic season, we assumed
constant sampling over time. The weather data used for the correlation analysis was
obtained from www.meteoblue.com. This data is based on measurements of weather
stations which are then used in simulations to estimate local weather variables (see
https://content.meteoblue.com/nl/specifications/data-sources).

We define two individuals to be connected if their pairwise phylogenetic distance is less
than 0.1 years. If we assume two individuals to be isolated at the same time, this cutoff
would correspond to a common ancestor that was at most 18.25 days ago. Considering
that the evolutionary rates we used to perform these inferences are long term rates and
therefore lower than the actual short term rates [26], we expect that the cutoff values
are effectively lower in reality. This means that if we use a cutoff of 0.1 years, even
individuals that are at an inferred pairwise distance of 0.1 years are very likely more
closely related than that. To avoid biases originating from these cutoff values, we
repeated all analyses that are based on cutoffs with of 0.05, 0.15, 0.2 and 0.3 years as
the cutoff value.

We estimate the average number of connections members from each of the six categorial
age/family status groups have, according to the above definition of connectedness. To
do so, we model the number of connections an individual from a group has as a negative
binomial distribution. This allows us to model the number of connections an individual
from a group has, while taking the variance of the relationship between the group label
and the number of connections into account. This is in contrast to, for example, the
poisson or geometric models. We assess overall model fit with an ANOVA and then

multiple testing by using Schaffer’s method, which is similarly conservative to bonferroni,
but takes into account the dependencies enforced in a linear modelling framework [31].

To identify mixing patterns between the six categorial age/family status groups, we
again use the definition of connection of two patients.
We use two different approaches to estimate how different groups are connected to
each other. First, we use multinomial logistic regression to estimate the probability that
a member from one group is connected to a member from another group. As weights,
we use the inverse number of samples from each group. This implicitly assumes that
individuals from each group have the same probability of being infected. Children
however might have higher rates of infection, and we therefore expect this weighting to
underestimate the role of children and to overestimate the role of adults
Second, we use a permutation approach. Between any two groups a and b, we
compute the probability of them being associated with one another as follows: For each
combination of groups a and b, we count the number of pairs that are associated with
one another. We then randomly permute the age labels 106 times. For each permutation,
we calculate if the number of pairs between these groups is greater or smaller than what
we observed. From these values, we then compute the probability that age groups a and

repeated this analysis using cut-off values of 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2 and 0.3 years.

We first assessed how the 669 sampled cases in Basel compare to 11,000 sequences
sampled from around the world between January 2016 and December 2017, by inferring
a phylogenetic tree using the hemagglutinin (HA) sequences. The Basel sequences span
the existing global diversity (see figure 1a), suggesting strong exchange of viruses with
other areas around the globe. We however did not find isolates in Basel that were part
of the same clade as the vaccine strain in that season. The number of sampled
sequences in Basel peaked at the end of 2016, with a smaller peak at the beginning of
February of 2017 (see figure 1b). The sequenced cases were dominated by the 3c2
sub-clades A1, A1a and A3, and we observe that a peak in A1a cases mainly
contributed to the peak in February of 2017.
Basel sequences cluster into local transmission clusters within the global diversity
(see Materials and Methods). We obtained around 240 local clusters (see figure 1c and

sampled sequences were the result of around 240 influenza introductions from areas
outside of Basel. In order to investigate if this number is a strict lower bound for the
number of introductions, we use random subsets of the 669 sequences to re-estimate the
number of introductions. We find that the number of estimated introductions grows
approximately linearly with the number of sequences in a subset (see figure 1c). This
suggests that with additional sampling effort, we would have captured more
introductions. With its own international airport, the airport of Zürich nearby, and a
major rail hub, Basel is well connected to the rest of Europe and the world. As such,
people working in Basel often do not live in the city and commute daily from elsewhere
in Switzerland, Germany and France. Basel is a tourist destination and often hosts
international conferences, attracting people from all over the world. This connectedness
likely drives these introductions of influenza into the city.

After introduction into the city, we next study how influenza is transmitted locally.
Clusters with more than one isolate have an average tree height of around 30 days (see
figure 1e), which we interpret as a lower bound of how long transmission chains
persisted within the city. In order to quantify the amount of local transmission, we
estimated the effective reproduction number (Ref f ) to be between 1 and 1.5 for most of
the season, which agrees with previous estimates of the effective reproduction number
for seasonal influenza [32]. The Ref f peaks in December and in February (see figure 1f)
with the 95% credible interval excluding and Ref f of 1 in December. In January, we
inferred a drop in the effective reproduction number with the estimated median being
below 1, which is consistent with the trend in the number of sampled cases (see
figure 1f). Further, these estimates are comparable to the overall trend of influenza
cases during the 2016/2017 season in Europe (https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publicationsdata/summary-influenza-2016-2017-season-europe).
We next investigated potential factors determining the changes in Ref f . The number
of influenza cases over the years show a strong seasonality, with the majority of cases
occurring in the winter months in both the northern and southern hemisphere [7].
Relative humidity and temperature have been described to drive influenza
transmission [33]. Additionally, the effect of school closures on the spread of pandemic
influenza has been discussed [34, 35]. Thus we investigated potential correlations of
Ref f with temperature,relative humidity and school days (i.e. days when children go to
school). As we only studied one season, these correlations have to be interpreted with
caution, and analyses of other seasons are needed to confirm the potential correlations.
Neither humidity nor school days showed a significant correlation: relative humidity
stayed fairly constant over the season, and both low and high Ref f are found during
times when schools were open (figure 1g and figures 7, 8 and 9). To account for
autocorrelation, we performed the correlation analysis, averaging the temperature,
relative humidity and mean number of school days over 4, 6, 8 and 10 days instead of
just 2 days. We find the mean temperature to be significantly correlated with the mean
Ref f in both scenarios (see figures 6 and 8). While previous studies in animal models
observed higher effective reproduction numbers at lower temperatures,
Viral shedding of viruses has been shown previously to be increased at lower
temperatures in animal models [33] and higher absolute humidity has been shown to
favor transmission on a population level [36]. We here observe lower effective
reproduction numbers at lower temperatures. The correlation of the effective
reproduction number with the temperature however is not necessarily causal, as it for
example could be due to social behaviour being different at lower temperatures.

Additionally, the computed p-values could be inflated due to unaccounted
autocorrelation.
Along with the Ref f , we co-estimated the sampling probability, that is the
probability of an infected individual being sampled. Since we followed the same
procedure for inclusion of patients throughout the epidemic season [15], we assumed
that this probability is constant throughout the influenza season. We estimated the
sampling probability to be between 3% and 5% (see figures 1d and 5). In contrast to
the Ref f estimates, this value is more sensitive to the procedure of clustering of
sequences into sets of locally transmitted sequences (see figure 5). Additionally, the
prior probability on the effective reproduction number, as well as the assumed becoming
un-infectious rate can influence this estimate [37]. With 676 samples from different
patients included in this analysis, this would suggest that between 13’500 and 22’500
people in Basel or between 8% and 13% of its population of about 171’000 were infected
with influenza H3N2 during the 2016-17 season. The city limits of Basel are however in
reality not fixed and the metropolitan area of Basel is much larger. Furthermore we
have sampled patients who went to a doctor or Hospital in the city of Basel, but live in
the surrounding areas or other parts of the world. We therefore expect the estimate of
between 8% and 13% to be an estimate for the upper bound of the number of infected
people, rather than the true percentage of infected individuals.
Overall, our analyses suggest that transmission occurred with an effective
reproduction number varying between 1-1.5 throughout the season, overall infecting at
most 8-13% of the population.

After having determined the importance of introductions of influenza into the city and
the overall rate at which influenza is spread in the city, we next studied the effect that
age and family status has on the overall spread. Figures 2a and b show the patient age
distribution within our samples. In order to study the role of age and family status in
spreading influenza, we next subdivided our Basel patients into four different age
groups, preschoolers (<7 years old), school-aged children (7 to 17 years), adults (18 to
65 years) and the elderly (>65 years old). We further categorized adults into three
subgroups corresponding to family status: adults for whom we know that they live in
the same household as children, adults for whom we know that they do not and adults
for whom we do not have this information. We thus have overall six different categories
of patient groups.
For each individual infected with influenza in each of these categorical groups, we
determined the number of patients with influenza viruses isolated below a certain
phylogenetic distance. This number, we then define as the number of connections a
patient has. A connection exists if the pairwise phylogenetic distance between viruses
isolated from two patients is at most 0.1 years. We then evaluate the mean number of
connections of a negative binomial distribution for all individuals from each of the six
groups. We later repeated the analyses using different cutoff values. This way of
defining two viral isolates to be connected is therefore done independently of the above
used definition of local transmission clusters. Using pairwise distances allows us to use
distance in the transmission chain whereas from the same cluster only says if two
sequences originated from the same introduction.
We find that school-aged children are on average connected to more individuals,
than preschoolers (see figure 2c). This difference is statistically significant after multiple
hypothesis testing at a cutoff value of 0.1 years, but not other cutoff values. We further,
but not significantly, find that adults that reported to live in the same household as

Fig 2. Age Distribution and differences in the number of connections to
other patients that members of the different categorical patient groups
have. A Distribution of patient ages in this study in age group intervals of 10 years.
The intervals are different from the age groups used in the analysis due to the
availability of age data for the population of Basel. B Proportion of different age groups
in this study compared to in the city of Basel. C Model-based confidence intervals for
the difference in average number of connections between each pair of age groups from a
negative binomial model. Upper and lower bounds represent 95% confidence intervals
for the average fold-difference in connection number between two groups corrected for
multiple hypothesis testing using the Tukey method. This means that confidence
intervals that do not include 1 are statistically significant. We see that the average
connection number for elderly patients is twice the average connection number for
preschoolers, adults without children, and adults with unknown status. These values are
estimated for a cutoff values of 0.1 years. Estimates for different cutoff values are shown
in figure 10. Also, the estimates of the mean number of connections in each group are
shown in figure 11.
children are on average connected to more patients than those that do not live in the
same household as children. For the elderly, we find that they have significantly more
connections compared to adults with unknown household status, adults without
children, and preschoolers. They do not have more connections on average compared to
adults living in the same household as children and school aged children. In summary,
there is signal for school children and elderly having more connections to other
individuals compared to the three groups unknown household status, adults without
children, and preschoolers. The adult living in the same household as children group
show tendencies to be connected more in average than the latter three groups, though
the data is not informative enough, respectively we do not have enough data, to provide
strong evidence for that.
That school aged children and elderly are connected to more individuals than the
other groups can have different explanations. The most obvious one is that individuals
of these groups are more likely to participate in transmission events, either as a donor or
recipient; alternatively, strong mixing within a group and a higher probability of visiting
a doctor upon infection and therefore a higher sampling probability could act as an
explanation (if members from any group are equally likely to transmit or receive
influenza to and from members of any other group, higher sampling probability would
increase to number of connections of every group and not just one).
In order to assess the potential reasons, we investigated how strongly or weakly
different age groups are connected with each other. We did so using two different
approaches. First, we estimated the probability that an individual from a group is
connected to a member from the same or a different group by using multinomial logistic
regression with the inverse number of samples from each group as weights. Second, we

Fig 3. Mixing of different age groups that are in proximity to each other.
Here we show the mixing patterns between the different categorial patient groups. We
define pairs of patients to be connected if their pairwise phylogenetic distance was below
0.1 years. Results for other thresholds are shown in Figures 12 and 13. A Probability
that an individual from the group in each row is connected to an individual from the
group in a column. These probabilities were calculated by using the inverse number of
samples from each group as weights. Upper and lower bounds correspond to 95%
confidence intervals around the estimated probability. B The color of each tile in the
heatmap corresponds to the p-value for either positive (red) or negative (blue)
associations. These p-values are bonferroni corrected for the number of comparisons
(42). We estimate these p-values by randomly permuting the group to patient labels and
then comparing the number of pairs of interactions we observe in the data vs. when
randomly permuting.

use permutation testing to estimate the probability that the number of connections
between different groups is significantly higher or lower than expected if all groups
would be equally connected. To do so, we again use the definition of a connection
between pairs of patients from the last section.
For both approaches, we find that mostly school-aged children are associated with
other school-aged children, and the elderly are associated with other elderly people. We
additionally find higher association between children of any age and adults living in the
same household as children than children of any age and adults without children (see
figure 3). Adults living in the same household as children, on the other hand, are
estimated to have low association to other adults without children and much higher
association to children, whereas adults without children are mostly associated to other
adults without children (see figure 3a).
Increased sampling of the elderly relative to the other age groups is likely to occur,
since the elderly are more likely to visit a doctor when in case of infections with
influenza [38]. Thus, strong mixing within group and high sampling, might explain the
increased connectivity of the elderly.
The second group that we found to have many connections to other patients where
school-aged children. When looking to which groups these were connected, we found
them to be associated with other school-aged children. However, they are unlikely to be
sampled more than preschoolers [39], and we do not see evidence for oversampling of
this group compared to preschoolers (see figure 2b). We therefore interpret our results
as school-aged children being involved in more transmission events compared to the
other patient groups, including preschoolers. Furthermore, adults living in the same
household as children might get mainly infected by the children and not by other adults,
which does however not mean that adults do not play a crucial role in introducing novel
lineages into the city. Indeed, children have been previously reported to be a strong
driver of influenza transmission [14].
These interpretations however are based on the analysis of influenza isolates from
one season and city and will therefore need to be repeated in different seasons and cities
to get a more complete understanding of the transmission patterns of influenza across
age groups.

In absence of deep knowledge of the important drivers of the local spread of
SARS-CoV-2, governments around the world resorted to closing down societies to
reduce the burden of COVID-19. Better understanding of how a disease is spread can
help optimizing non-pharmaceutical interventions in order to reduce the burden on
societies, while still effectively reducing transmission.
One of the diseases that are major reoccurring burdens on societies are seasonal
influenza viruses. Seasonal influenza annually infects a large portion of the global
population and while its global spread has been studied extensively, its local spread
remains largely unstudied. Our results are based on one of the most densely sampled
genetic datasets of influenza sequences to date. Additionally, we connected the genetic
information to patient information such a residential address and age for all and more
personal information for a lot of the patients, providing unparalleled resolution to study
how influenza spreads locally. The 2016/17 season for which we collected data was
dominated by influenza A/H3N2. Based on this data, we observe that hundreds of
introductions initiate the seasonal influenza epidemic in the studied city of Basel, that
the overall spread varies throughout the season, and that children seem to drive the
local outbreaks, while elderly have their own transmission chains.
It will be interesting to see how these results transfer to other cities and seasons with

potentially other social structure or other geographical location. In particular, the
subtypes that circulate and their ability to escape host immunity and seasons
dominated by different influenza types may influence mixing patterns. For the future, it
will be particularly interesting to see if seasons where other subtypes such as influenza
A/H1N1 or influenza B dominate show the same or differing patterns that we observed.
While such studies on a population level requires great effort in recruiting patients as
well as in sequencing viruses, they can greatly improve our understanding of how
influenza spreads locally. This will hopefully allow us to streamline public health
interventions in the most efficient way possible, and thus, help to reduce the great
burden on societies caused by the seasonal flu.

Quality criteria for sequences used in this study

397

Overall, the dataset included sequencing runs from 842 unique isolates. For some of
these isolated, sequencing was performed more than once. In this case, the isolate that
fulfilled the quality criteria detailed below better was used. These isolates, in some
cases, were isolated from the same patient, but at different time points. Bases were
called to be neutral if the coverage for a site was less than 100. If a segment of a
sequence had more than 20% neutral bases on more than 5 segments, the sequence was
not used for further analysis. If the HA segment was not part of the 3 segments that
were had less than 20% neutral bases, the sequence was discarded as well. Using the
same criteria but requiring at least 4 segments, would have resulted in 736 sequences to
be used. For 5 segments, 728 would have passed, 719 for 6 segments, 713 for 7 and 664
for 8. This quality criteria was most likely violated by the NA segment, explaining the
drop of isolates that would have been used when requiring all 8 segments instead of 7.
For patients with more than 1 isolate that passed the quality control, the sequence that
was isolated earlier was used.

Fig 4. Estimates of the sampling proportion for different classifications of
sequences into local clusters. Each histogram shows an inferred sampling
proportion based on a classification of sequences into local clusters. Since these
classifications are dependent on which iteration of the MCMC was used for the
classification into local clusters, we repeated the analysis using 10 different random
iterations. Each subplot shows the estimated sampling proportion when using one of
these classifications. The dotted red line shows the median estimate of the sampling
proportion over all iterations.

Here we show the estimated p-values for the correlation between the effective

when the data was averaged over different number of days (x-axis). The estimate
p-values are shown for two different time intervals (in different colors). For the orange
line, estimates for 1 November 2016 until 1 March 2017 were used and for the blue line,
estimated from Dezember until February were used. These plots were generated using
the effective reproduction number averaged over 10 different classifications of sequences
into local clusters. The equivalent plots for generated using the effective reproduction
number estimates of each individual subset is shown in figure 8.

patient from the group shown by the color is connected to. Upper and lower bounds
correspond to 95% confidence intervals around the average. We consider two patients to
be connected if the pairwise phylogenetic distance between the influenza viruses
sequenced from them is below a certain threshold. These thresholds are 0.05 years in

Fig 13. Mixing of different age groups when using different cutoff values.
Plots are analogue to figure 3b, but for different thresholds. The thresholds in years are
given on top of each subfigure. Unless very large thresholds are used, the elderly are
estimated to be positively associated with other members from the same group. School
aged children are associated with other school aged children except for very low
thresholds where the number of pairs is very low. Elderly being negatively associated
with pre-school aged children shows up only at lower thresholds.
