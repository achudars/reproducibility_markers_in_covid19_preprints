Abstract
A severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has recently
caused a pandemic COVID-19 disease that infected more than 25.6 million and killed 852,000
people worldwide. Like the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also employs a receptor-binding motif
(RBM) of its envelope spike protein for binding the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) to gain viral entry. Currently, extensive efforts are being made to produce vaccines
against a surface fragment of a SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike protein, in order to boost
protective antibody responses.

It was previously unknown how spike protein-targeting

antibodies would affect innate inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here we
generated a highly purified recombinant protein corresponding to the RBM of SARS-CoV-2, and
used it to screen for cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We found two RBM-binding
mAbs that competitively inhibited its interaction with human ACE2, and specifically blocked the
RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion in both human monocyte and murine macrophage cultures.
Our findings have suggested a possible strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2-elicited “cytokine
storm”, and provided a potentially useful criteria for future assessment of innate immunemodulating properties of various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Introduction
Shortly after the 2003 outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a βcoronavirus (SARS-CoV) 1, the recent emergence and rapid spread of SARS-like coronavirus 2,
SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic COVID-19 that is catastrophically damaging human
health. As of 1 September 2020, more than 25.6 million people have been infected, leading to
more than 852,000 deaths in 216 countries (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novelcoronavirus-2019). Like the SARS-CoV 1, SARS-CoV-2 virus also employs its envelope spike
(S) glycoproteins to recognize and bind a host cell surface receptor, the angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2), to gain host cell membrane fusion and viral entry2-8. Structurally, the SARSCoV-2 S protein contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that embraces a receptor-binding
motif (RBM) in a “closed” configuration inaccessible by the host ACE2 receptor.

Upon

cleavage of the S protein by host proteases such as furin and the transmembrane protease/serine
subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), the RBD undergoes a conformational change (from a “closed”
to an “open” configuration) that enables the “exposure” of RBM to host cell receptors 8-14.

In the absence of effective therapies, vaccination has become a key option to boost adaptive
antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 infections. One approach is to use a surface fragment
of a SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike (S) protein as antigens

15

, in the hope that antibodies

targeting the S protein may inhibit viral interaction with host ACE2 receptor to prevent viral
entry 15. In patients infected by SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing antibodies targeting
the RBD or RBM region of respective S proteins were found 1, 3-7, 16-18; and some of them indeed
impaired RBD-ACE2 interaction

17

and viral entry

4, 16

. Intriguingly, a previous study revealed

that antibodies against different epitopes of SARS-CoV S protein exhibited divergent effects:

antibodies targeting RBM (residue 471-503) conferred protection; whereas antibodies targeting
epitopes (e.g., residue 597-603) outside of the RBM region worsen the outcomes 19. However, it
was previously unknown how RBM-targeting antibodies would affect innate inflammatory
responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections?

Recently, emerging evidence suggested that ACE2 might also be expressed on innate immune
cells such as human peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs)

20, 21

and murine macrophage-like

RAW 264.7 cells 21. Furthermore, human PBMCs produced several pro-inflammatory cytokines
(e.g., TNF, IL-1β and IL-6) and chemokines (e.g., IL-8 and MIP-1β) in response to SARS-CoV
S protein stimulation

22

. However, it was previously unknown how RBM-binding monoclonal

antibodies (mAbs) affect the SARS-CoV-2-elicited innate immune responses. In the present
study, we sought to screen for mAbs capable of binding SARS-CoV-2 RBM, and determine how
these RBM-binding mAbs affect the RBM-induced cytokine/chemokine production in monocyte
and macrophage cultures.

Results
Generation of recombinant RBD and RBM protein fragments of SARS-CoV-2.
To screen for monoclonal antibodies capable of binding the RBD or RBM region of SARS-CoV2 spike protein (Fig. 1A), we generated recombinant RBD and RBM corresponding to residue
319-541 and residue 437-508 of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (Fig. 1B). These recombinant
proteins were purified from insoluble inclusion bodies by differential centrifugation, urea
solubilization, and histidine-tag affinity chromatography (Fig. 1C). Extensive washing of the
immobilized recombinant RBD or RBM proteins with buffer containing 8.0 M urea effectively
removed contaminating bacterial endotoxins. Subsequently, the purified RBD and RBM was
dialyzed in a buffer supplemented with a reducing agent, Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine
(TCEP), to prevent excessive oxidation and cross-linking of the nine and two Cysteine (C)
residues in RBD and RBM, respectively (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1D, amino acid sequence
analysis revealed a high homology between a tyrosine (Y)-rich segment (YNYLYR) of SARSCoV-2 RBM and the epitope sequence (NDALYEYLRQ) of several monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) that we recently generated against human tetranectin (TN)

23

, suggesting a possibility

that some TN-binding mAbs might cross-react with SARS-CoV-2.

Recombinant RBM interacted with human ACE2 and some TN-binding mAbs.
To evaluate the ACE2-binding properties of recombinant RBD or RBM, the extracellular domain
of human ACE2 was immobilized to the NTA sensor chip, and recombinant RBD or RBM was
applied as analytes at different concentrations to estimate the dissociation equilibrium constant
(KD) using the Open SPR technique. Surprisingly, our recombinant RBD exhibited an extremely
low affinity to the extracellular domain of human ACE2 (Fig. 2A, upper panel), with an

estimated KD of 161,000 nM. It was postulated that the cysteine-rich RBD was not likely refolded into a “correct” conformation suitable for RBM-ACE2 interaction, because the high
probability of “incorrect” disulfide cross-linking was factorially proportional to its high number
of Cysteine residues. In contrast, the KD for ACE2-RBM interaction ranged around 42.5 – 64.1
nM (Fig 2A, lower panel; Fig. 2B), regardless whether ACE2 or RBM was conjugated to the
NTA sensor chip before respective application of RBM or ACE2 as analyte at different
concentrations. Given the proximity between our estimated KD for RBM-ACE2 interaction and
the previously reported KD (15 – 44.2 nM) for SARS-CoV-2 S protein-ACE2 interaction

12, 18

,

we concluded that the ACE2-binding property was well-preserved in our recombinant RBM.
Therefore, we conjugated a highly purified recombinant RBM on an NTA sensor chip, and use it
to screen for SARS-CoV-2 RBM-binding mAbs. In agreement with a homology between SARSCoV-2 RBM and epitope sequence of several TN-specific mAbs (Fig. 1D), we found that 2 out
of 3 mAbs capable of recognizing a homologous epitope sequence (NDALYEYLRQ)

23

exhibited a dose-dependent interaction with RBM (Fig. 2C), with an estimated KD of 17.4 and
62.8 nM, respectively. This estimated KD was comparable to that of other SARS-CoV-2 RBDbinding neutralizing antibodies (KD = 14 -17 nM) recently isolated from COVID-19 patients

24,

25

.

RBM-binding mAbs competitively inhibited RBM-ACE2 interaction.
We then tested whether pre-treatment of RBM-conjugated sensor chip with RBM-binding mAb
competitively inhibited subsequent RBM-ACE2 interactions. When conjugated to a sensor chip,
the recombinant RBM exhibited a dose-dependent interaction with the extracellular domain of
human ACE2 (Fig. 3A), as well as a RBM-binding mAb (mAb8) (Fig. 3B). However, after pre-

treatment with mAb8, the maximal response unit was markedly reduced from ~500 (Fig. 3A) to
175 (Fig. 3C) when ACE2 was applied as analyte to the RBM-coated sensor chip at identical
concentrations. Meanwhile, the estimated KD for RBM-ACE2 interaction was increased by an
almost ten-fold from 13.3 nM (Fig. 3A) to 130.0 nM (Fig. 3C), suggesting that RBM-binding
mAbs competitively RBM-ACE2 interactions.

RBM-binding mAbs specifically blocked the RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion in primary
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (huPBMCs).
To examine the possible impact of RBM-binding mAbs on its immuno-stimulatory properties,
human primary monocytes were stimulated with recombinant RBD or RBM in the absence or
presence of RBM-binding mAbs (mAb8 and mAb2), and the levels of 42 different cytokines and
chemokines were measured simultaneously by Antibody Arrays. In agreement with a previous
report that SARS-CoV spike (S) protein stimulated human PBMCs to produce proinflammatory
cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF)

22

, we observed a marked elevation of these three

cytokines in the RBD- or RBM-stimulated human monocytes (Fig. 4A, 4B). In addition, both
RBD and RBM also markedly stimulated the secretion of an anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10)
and two chemokines (MIP-1δ and MCP-1) in parallel (Fig. 4A, 4B). Astonishingly, our highly
purified RBM, but not RBD, also markedly induced the secretion of a myeloid growth factor, the
granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in human monocytes (Fig. 4A,
4B). However, the co-addition of two RBM-binding mAbs similarly and specifically blocked
the RBM-induced secretion of GM-CSF (Fig. 4A, 4B) without affecting the RBM-induced
release of other cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF) or chemokines (MIP-1δ and MCP1).

RBM-binding mAbs also specifically blocked the RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion in murine
macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells.
To further confirm the GM-CSF-inducing activities of SARS-CoV-2 RBM, we stimulated
murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells with highly purified RBM in the absence or presence
of RBM-binding mAbs, and measured the extracellular levels of 62 different cytokines by
Antibody Arrays. Compared with human monocytes, murine macrophages appeared to be less
responsive to RBM stimulation, and released relatively fewer cytokines after stimulation (Fig.
5A). However, SARS-CoV-2 RBM still markedly elevated the secretion of TNF and GM-CSF
in murine macrophage cultures (Fig. 5A).

Similarly, two different RBM-binding mAbs

selectively blocked the RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion in macrophage cultures (Fig. 5A, 5B)
without affecting the RBM-induced TNF secretion (Fig. 5A, 5B).

Discussion
In the present study, we have generated a highly purified recombinant RBM corresponding to
residue 437-508 of SARS-CoV-2, and confirmed its well-preserved ACE2-binding properties.
Furthermore, we have found two RBM-cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies that competitively
inhibited RBM-ACE2 interaction and selectively inhibited the RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion
in both human monocyte and murine macrophage cultures. It raised an exciting possibility that
vaccines capable of eliciting RBM-targeting antibodies may similarly attenuate the SARS-CoV2-induced GM-CSF production and “cytokine storm” in clinical settings.

“Cytokine storm” refers a hyperactive inflammatory response manifested by the excessive
infiltration, expansion and activation of myeloid cells (e.g., monocytes and macrophages) and
consequent production of various cytokines and chemokines (e.g., GM-CSF, TNF, IL-1β, IL-6,
and MCP-1). It has also been suggested as a “driver” of the disease progression particularly in a
subset (~ 20%) of COVID-19 patients with more severe pneumonia that often escalates to
respiratory failure and death

26-29

. Furthermore, GM-CSF might also be a key mediator of the

cytokine storm in COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases

30, 31

.

First, GM-CSF was

upregulated before TNF, IL-6, and MCP-1 in animal model of SARS-CoV infection

32

, and its

excessive production adversely contributed to the SARS-CoV-induced lung injury 32. Second,
consistent with the critical contribution of myeloid cells to cytokine storm 28, the percentage of
GM-CSF-expressing leukocytes was significantly increased in a subset of patients with severe
COVID-19

33, 34

.

Thus, the excessive production of GM-CSF may adversely propagate a

dysregulated cytokine storm in a subset of COVID-19 patients (Fig. 6). One the one hand, GMCSF can promote myelopoiesis by mobilizing progenitor myeloid cells to sites of SARS-CoV-2

infection, and facilitating their proliferation and differentiation into various innate immune cells,
such as monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells

30

. On the other hand, GM-CSF can also

polarize mature myeloid cells into a pro-inflammatory phenotype, and stimulate the production
of various proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL-1β and IL-6) and chemokines (e.g., MCP-1)
30

.

Currently, GM-CSF has attracted substantial interest as a therapeutic target for the clinical
management of COVID-19

31, 35

. For instance, several companies were actively planning for

COVID-19 clinical trials using anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibodies (Clinical Trial Registry #:
NCT04341116, NCT04351243, NCT04351152, NCT04376684)

31, 35, 36

. In a recent clinical

study, repetitive intravenous infusion of an anti-human GM-CSF mAb (Lenzilumab, 600 mg,
thrice) significantly improved blood oxygenation, and simultaneously reduced blood levels of
two pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1α and IL-6) in 11 out of 12 patients with severe
COVID-19 37. It will thus be important to verify whether our GM-CSF-inhibiting mAbs (mAb8
or mAb2) are similarly protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection in experimental and clinical
settings. This is relevant because our mAbs have already been proven protective in animal
model of sepsis partly by reversing immunosuppression and enhancing anti-microbial immune
responses

23

. In light of the on-going effort in developing effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, it

may be important to assess the innate immune-modulating properties of all vaccine candidates
and respective antibodies in experimental and clinical settings 38.

Currently, it is not known whether COVID-19 patients with more severe disease progression are
generally deficient in RBM-reactive antibodies? Similarly, it is not clear whether different

vaccines elicit distinct antibodies that may divergently affect SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine
storm and organ dysfunction? Finally, it remains elusive whether some SARS-CoV-2-elicited
antibodies also cross-react with host proteins in such a way that may adversely compromise the
half-life and/or efficacy of some protective antibodies?

However, our present study has

suggested a novel strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2-elicited “cytokine storm” using RBMtargeting antibodies. Moreover, we have provided an experimental reagent (RBM) and an innate
immune cell-based assay for the on-going investigation of the complex pathophysiology of
COVID-19 as well as evaluation of the protective efficacy and innate immune-modulating
properties of various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Materials and Methods
Material
Murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, 11995-065)
and penicillin / streptomycin (Cat. 15140-122) were from Invitrogen/Life Technologies
(Carlsbad, CA). Fetal bovine serum was from Crystalgen (FBS-500, Commack, NY) and heatinactivated before use. The monoclonal antibodies against human tetranectin were generated in
Balb/C and C57BL/6 mice at the GenScript (Piscataway, NJ, USA) as previously described

23

.

Highly purified recombinant human ACE2 corresponding to the extracellular domain (Gln18Ser740) was obtained from two different commercial sources, Biolegend (Cat. # 7920008) and
Raybiotech (Cat. # 230-30165).

Cell culture
Human blood was purchased from the New York Blood Center (Long Island City, NY, USA),
and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (HuPBMCs) were isolated by density gradient
centrifugation through Ficoll (Ficoll-Paque PLUS) as previously described

23

.

Murine

macrophages or human monocytes (HuBPMCs) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 1%
penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FBS or 10% human serum.

When they reached 70-80%

confluence, adherent cells were gently washed with, and immediately cultured in, OPTI-MEM I
before stimulating with highly purified recombinant RBD or RBM in the absence or presence of
anti-TN mAbs.

The extracellular concentrations of various cytokines/chemokines were

determined by Cytokine Antibody Arrays as previously described 39.

Preparation of recombinant RBD and RBM proteins
The cDNAs encoding for the ACE2 receptor binding domain (RBD, residue 319 - 541) or
receptor binding motif (RBM, residue 437-508) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) were cloned
into a pCAL-n vector, and the recombinant proteins with an N-terminal Histidine Tag (6 × His)
were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells in the presence of 3.0 mM IPTG (isopropyl-1-thiobeta-D-galactopyranoside).

Recombinant RBD and RBM proteins were isolated from the

inclusion bodies by differential centrifugation, and further purified by urea (8.0 M Urea, 20 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.9) solubilization and agarose bead-immobilized metal (Ni2+) affinity
chromatography. After extensive washing with buffer 1 (20 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM imidazole,
0.5 M NaCl, 8.0 M Urea, pH 8.0) and buffer 2 (20% DPBS1X, 10% glycerol, 8.0 M Urea, pH
7.5), the recombinant histidine-tagged RBD or RBM proteins were eluted with buffer containing
0.5 M Imidazole,10% Glycerol, 20% DPBS1X, 8.0 M Urea, pH 8.0. The recombinant proteins
were then further purified by dialysis at 4⁰ C in buffer containing 20% DPBS1X, 10 % Glycerol
and 0.5 mM TCEP, pH8.0.

Recombinant proteins were tested for LPS content by the

chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Endochrome; Charles River), and the endotoxin
content was less than 0.01 U per microgram of recombinant proteins.

Open Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)
We used the Nicoya Lifesciences gold-nanoparticle-based Open Surface Plasmon Resonance
(OpenSPR) technology to estimate the binding kinetics and affinity of ACE2 or monoclonal
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD or RBM following the manufacturer’s instructions.

For

instance, highly purified recombinant RBD or RBM was immobilized on the NTA sensor chip
(Cat. # SEN-Au-100-10-NTA), and ACE2 or mAb was applied at different concentrations. The

response units were recorded over time, and the binding affinity was estimated as the equilibrium
dissociation constant KD using the Trace Drawer Kinetic Data Analysis v.1.6.1. (Nicoya
Lifesciences) as previously described 23. To determine the possible competition with the human
ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 RBM was immobilized to NTA sensor chips via histidine tag for a final
RU around 500. A RBM-binding mAb was injected onto the chip until binding steady-state was
reached, and ACE2 was re-injected as analyte at identical concentrations. The competition
capacity of RBM-binding mAb was determined by the level of reduction in response units of
ACE2 with and without prior mAb incubation. Results presented are representatives of two
independent experiments.

Cytokine Antibody Array
Human Cytokine Antibody C3 Arrays (Cat. No. AAH-CYT-3-4), which detect 42 cytokines on
one membrane, were used to determine cytokine concentrations in human monocyte-conditioned
culture medium as previously described

23

.

Murine Cytokine Antibody Arrays (Cat. No.

M0308003, RayBiotech Inc.), which simultaneously detect 62 cytokines on one membrane, were
used to measure relative cytokine concentrations in macrophage-conditioned culture medium as
described previously 23, 40.

Statistical analysis
All data were assessed for normality by the Shapiro-Wilk test before conducting statistical tests
among multiple groups by one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Fisher Least
Significant Difference (LSD) test. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

motif (RBM) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. A) Schematic diagram of SARS-CoV spike
protein (S) and its ACE2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and motif (RBM). B) Amino acid
sequence of RBD and RBM of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2. RBM sequence is denoted by text
in green; “@”, denote residues in close contact with ACE2 (Lan, et al 2020). C) SARS-CoV-2
spike protein RBD and RBM corresponding to amino acids 319-541 and 437-508 with an Nterminal histidine tag were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells, and purified by
differential centrifugation of inclusion bodies, urea solubilization and histidine-tag affinity
chromatography. D) SARS-CoV-2 RBM contains a sequence highly homologous to the epitope
sequence (NDALYEYLRQ) of several anti-TN monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).

Figure 2. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBM binds to human ACE2 receptor and some TNreactive mAbs. A) Highly purified extracellular domain of human ACE2 was immobilized on a
sensor chip, and recombinant RBD or RBM was applied as analyte at various concentrations to
estimate the dissociation equilibrium constant (KD). B, C) Highly purified recombinant RBM
was immobilized on the sensor chip, and recombinant human ACE2 (Panel B) or TN-specific
mAbs (Panel C) were applied as analyte at various concentrations to assess the KD for RBMACE2 (Panel B) or RBM-mAb (Panel C) interactions.

After extensive washing, mAb8 was applied at indicated concentrations (Panel B), before ACE2
were re-applied to the RBM-conjugated sensor chip at identical concentrations (as in Panel A).
The almost 10-fold increase in the KD (from 13.3 to 130.0 nM) and an almost 3-fold decrease
(from 500 to 165) in the response units suggested that pre-treatment with mAb8 markedly
inhibited RBM-ACE2 interaction.

RBM-reactive mAbs abrogated the RBM-induced secretion of GM-CSF in

human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Human peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (HuPBMCs) were isolated from blood of healthy donors, and stimulated with recombinant
RBD (3.0 µg/ml) or RBM (1.0 or 5.0 µg/ml) in the absence or presence of RBM-binding mAbs
(mAb8 or mAb2, at a molar ratio of 1:2 or 1:6). At 16 h post stimulation, the extracellular
concentrations of 42 different cytokines and chemokines were determined by Cytokine Antibody
Arrays (Panel A), and normalized by the positive controls (“+”) on respective membranes (Panel
B). *, P < 0.05 versus negative controls (“- RBM” or “-R”); #, P < 0.05 versus positive controls
(“+ RBM” or “+R”) at respective concentrations.

Figure 5. RBM-reactive mAbs blocked the RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion in murine
macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells. Murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated
with recombinant RBM (1.0 or 5.0 µg/ml) either alone or in the presence of two different RBMbinding mAbs (at a molar ratio of 1:6), and extracellular concentrations of 62 cytokines and
chemokines were measured by Cytokine Antibody Arrays at 16 h post stimulation. *, P < 0.05

Figure 6. Proposed model for the mAb-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RBM-induced
GM-CSF secretion.

SARS-CoV-2 RBM may bind ACE2 receptor to trigger the specific secretion of GM-CSF by
macrophages and monocytes.

Monoclonal antibodies capable of interrupting RBM-ACE2

interaction impairs the RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion without affecting the RBM-induced
release of other pro- (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, TNF) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10) or
chemokines (MCP-1 and MIP-1δ).

It might be important to assess the innate immune-

modulating properties of antibodies raised against various future SAR-CoV-2 vaccines.
