Abstract
cis-acting RNA motifs play a major role in regulating many aspects of RNA biology including posttranscriptional
processing, nuclear export, RNA localization, translation and degradation. Here we analyzed the genomes of SARSCoV-2 and other single-strand RNA (ssRNA) viruses for the presence of a unique cis RNA element called
SECReTE. This motif consists of 10 or more consecutive triplet nucleotide repeats where a pyrimidine nucleotide
(C or U) in present every third base, and which we identified in mRNAs encoding secreted proteins in bacteria,
yeast, and humans. This motif facilitates mRNA localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), along with the
enhanced translation and secretion of translated protein. We now examined for SECReTE presence in Group IV
and V RNA viruses, the former including the Coronaviridae, like SARS-CoV-2 and other positive (+)ssRNA
viruses, and the latter consisting of negative (-) ssRNA viruses. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains
40 SECReTE motifs at an abundance of ~1.3 SECReTEs/kilobase (kb). Moreover, all ssRNA viruses we examined
contain multiple copies of this motif and appears in (+)ssRNA viruses as non-random in occurrence and independent
of genome length. Importantly, (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Coronaviruses and Hepaciviruses), which utilize ER
membranes to create double membrane vesicles to serve as viral replication centers (VRCs), contain more
SECReTE motifs per kb as compared to (-)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Rabies, Mumps, and Influenza), that replicate in
the nucleus or the cytoplasm, or other (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Enteroviruses and Flaviviruses) which employ
different organellar membranes. As predicted by our earlier work, SECReTE sequences are mostly found in
membranal or ER-associated/secreted proteins. Thus, we propose that SECReTE motifs could be important for the
efficient translation and secretion of secreted viral proteins, as well as for VRC formation. Future studies of
SECReTE function and identification of SECReTE-binding proteins could provide new drug targets to treat
COVID-19 and other (+)ssRNA related diseases.

Introduction
Human infection with Coronaviridae (CoV) viruses can result in severe acute respiratory distress leading to
lethality. The recent outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus emphasizes the potent ability of human coronaviruses
(hCoVs) to infect and rapidly spread throughout the human population, given the absence of immune prophylaxis
(e.g. vaccination) or curative treatment. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive (+) single-strand RNA [(+)ssRNA] virus
comprising a genome of ~30kb encoding at least 29 viral proteins (VPs) involved in viral infection, replication, and
release1,2. The genome is organized into a 5’untranslated region (UTR)-leader sequence, followed by a large open
reading frame (ORF1ab) that encodes 16 non-structural VPs (nsp1-16), then by ORFs encoding the viral accessory
proteins and structural proteins (e.g. spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N)), and terminating
with a 3’UTR-polyA tail. The non-structural VPs are involved in the cleavage of polypeptide1ab (NSP5),
suppression of host antiviral response (nsp1), creation of the viral replication center from the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) (nsp2,3,4,6), and viral RNA replication (nsp7,8,9,10,12,13,14,15,16). Four structural VPs (S,E,M,N) form the
coat of the virus and along with other small ORFs facilitate virion assembly, release, and infection. As with other
(+)ssRNA viruses, upon infection the SARS-CoV-2 RNA acts as an mRNA for the direct translation of viral
ORF1ab.
As with other members of the hCoVs, infection of the lung epithelia with SARS-CoV-2 likely induces a
reticulo-vesicular network of ER-derived double membrane vesicles (DMVs) that form a discrete viral replication
organelle (or center; VRC)3-5. VPs are translated on the VRC surface, with many (i.e. soluble and membraneanchored proteins) translocated into the membrane of the newly forming structure. VRC formation, therefore,
represents an essential step for both vRNA replication and virion assembly, and hence, progressive infection upon
virion release. Yet, little is known of the organellar dynamics and interactions with either the viral RNA or VPs to
create the replication membrane, although morphological alteration of the ER (and, perhaps, other secretory
pathway organelles, e.g. lipid droplets, Golgi, endosomes) is consistent with the secretory nature of viral replication,
which first involves nsp translation and translocation.
The ER is the primary site for the translation and translocation of soluble secreted and membrane
(secretome) proteins. Thus, vRNA interactions with ER-associated RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) likely constitute
a critical rate-limiting step in VP production. In our work on RNA trafficking and association with intracellular
organelles as a means to regulate protein translation and localization, we recently identified a cis RNA element
present in nearly all secretome proteins from bacteria to humans6. This motif, entitled “secretion-enhancing cis
regulatory targeting element” (SECReTE), is based upon extended (>10 consecutive) triplet nucleotide repeats
whereby a pyrimidine nucleotide is present every third base, whether in coding regions (as NYN or NNY; where N
is any nucleotide and Y = U or C) or in the UTR regions. Mutational analyses performed using several yeast genes
encoding secreted proteins (e.g. SUC2, CCW12, HSP150) revealed that the addition or removal of SECReTE motifs
in yeast mRNAs could enhance or inhibit mRNA stability and association with the ER, respectively, thereby

affecting protein secretion and cell physiology. Thus, SECReTE is important for mRNA-protein interactions at the
level of the ER that facilitate protein production. We now identify numerous SECReTE motifs encoded in many of
SARS-CoV-2 VPs, particularly in those encoding membrane-associated proteins.
Viral SECReTE motifs (vSECReTEs) were found in the genes of all ssRNA viruses inspected and its
abundance (i.e. SECReTE/kb) correlates overall with the percentage of C and T nucleotides (%CT) in the genomes
(we use “T” instead of “U” henceforth for the convenience of sequence analysis). However, when looking at specific
%CT levels we see a wide variability in SECReTE score between viral families/genera. Importantly, we found that
(+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Coronaviridae and Hepaciviruses) that utilize ER-derived DMVs for replication centers35,7

contain more SECReTE motifs per kb as compared to (-)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Rhabdoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae,

and Paramyxoviridae), which replicate in the nucleus or the cytoplasm8-13, or other (+)ssRNA viruses which use
different organellar membranes and do not form ER-derived DMVs (e.g. Enteroviruses, Nodavirridae, and
Flaviviruses)4,5,7,14. Interestingly, the position of some vSECReTE motifs along the length of the Spike gene of all
seven human coronaviruses is quite similar. This co-occurrence may indicate the possibility of
conservation/convergence of motif position. Thus, we predict that SECReTE motifs may be important for the
association of viral RNA with the ER, as well as for the efficient translation of viral membrane proteins and creation
of VRCs at ER membranes. Thus, continued studies of SECReTE function and the identification of SECReTEbinding proteins could provide new drug targets to treat COVID-19, and other (+)ssRNA related diseases.

Results
SECReTE elements are present in the human Coronaviridae
Because of the current COVID-19 pandemic we questioned whether SECReTE elements are present in viruses,
particularly those of the hCoVs, and whether they may fulfill a role in viral replication and virion production. We
first determined if SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (gRNA) contains SECReTE motifs using the same script we used
to identify SECReTEs in yeast and human mRNAs6. We found that the ~30kb SARS-CoV-2 gRNA contains forty
motifs (Figure 1a). All SECReTE elements are located in protein coding sequences (CDS) and 72.5% of the
SECReTE elements are encoded in either membranal or secretion-associated proteins (e.g. nsp3, nsp4, nsp6,
ORF7a, ORF7b, S, M, E and N proteins). Notably, all motifs, but one, are in NNY or NYN frames (Figure 1A &
Supplementary Table S1). This result is similar to our findings in yeast and humans, in which mRNAs encoding
secretome proteins that contain either a signal peptide (SP) or TMD, as well as mRNAs encoding secreted proteins
that lack these domains, contain SECReTE elements6.
To test whether these SECReTE sequences are common to all SARS-CoV-2 strains, we screened for the
SECReTE motifs in the genomes of 493 different isolates of SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Table S2). We found
20 cases (~4%) in which a mutation occurred in a SECReTE motif (Table 1). In one case the mutation resulted in
motif elimination, while in another case the mutation resulted in motif creation. Two cases resulted in the shortening
or elongation of the motif. All other mutations, whether synonymous or non-synonymous, did not affect the
existence of the motif or its length. Currently, we cannot determine if these mutations affect the pathogenicity,
infectivity or other aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology.
Next, we compared the SECReTE content in SARS-CoV-2 to six other human coronaviruses, e.g. SARSCoV, MERS-CoV, hCoV-NL63, hCoV-229E, hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-HKU1. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are
considered potentially pandemic coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, similar to SARSCoV-2, but are less infectious and appear to result in a higher mortality rate than SARS-CoV-215. The other four
viruses are endemic to the human population and typically cause mild respiratory ailments with very low mortality
rates16. Of note, hCoV-NL63 and hCoV-229E belong to the Alpha-CoV genus with a slightly shorter genome as
compared to the other five CoVs, which belong to the Beta-CoV genus. All seven viruses contain SECReTE
sequences in varying amounts (i.e. between 40-85 SECReTE motifs), the highest being hCoV-NL63 (Figures 1BC and Supplementary Table S1). Based upon the limited data available regarding the infectivity and lethality of the
different human CoVs, we did not observe an association between the number of SECReTE sequences and viral
pathogenicity when comparing the three highly pathogenic (e.g. SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS) to the
three least pathogenic (e.g. hCoV-229E, HKU1 and OC43), particularly if the moderately pathogenic17 and most
SECReTE-enriched hCoV, hCoV-NL63, is not included (Supplementary Figure S1). At this juncture we cannot
draw any conclusions regarding a relationship between SECReTE elements and viral infectivity, replication, or
pathogenicity.

SECReTE elements are present in human CoV genes encoding membranal or secreted proteins
As with SARS-CoV-2, SECReTE sequences are not distributed equally along the length of the other hCoV
genomes, but are concentrated in specific genes. A large number of motifs (e.g. 4-6) are each found in the ORFs
encoding the S, nsp3,4, and 6, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12/RdRp) proteins (Figure 1D).
Although RdRp is not a secreted protein per se, it does need to be translated on ER membranes and localizes to the
DMV. Hence, we suspect that the high number of SECReTE motifs in the RdRp sequence may facilitate better
RNA localization to, and translation at, ER membranes/DMVs. The hemaglutinin esterase (HE) gene, which is
present only in the hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-HKU1 genomes, also contains a large number (e.g. 7-8) of SECReTE
elements. Only three of the hCoVs examined have SECReTE elements in their 5’UTRs and only one has a motif in
the 3’UTR. Since the non-structural proteins are translated as two long polypeptides (pp1a and pp1ab), we scored
the total number of SECReTE of pp1ab for each virus. As expected, pp1ab contains the largest number of
SECReTEs, with a high variability between the different CoVs. The only exception is hCoV-HKU1, which contains
more SECReTE sequences in S as compared to pp1ab.
Similar to the situation in yeast and human mRNAs, SECReTE elements are mainly found in genes
encoding secretome proteins [i.e. secreted proteins likely to possess transmembrane domains (TMDs) and/or signal
peptides (SP)6 and Supplementary Table S3]. In SARS-CoV-2, fourteen SECReTE elements are found in TMDs
out of a total of twenty-seven TMDs, and two elements were found in SPs out of total of three SPs present (Figure
1A and Supplementary Table S1). SARS-CoV-2 has the highest number of TMD sequences with SECReTE motifs
out of the seven human CoVs examined (Figures 1E-F).
To test whether SECReTE sequences might be positionally conserved among the seven hCoVs, we aligned
the S gene sequences and looked for co-occurrences of the SECReTE motifs. Strikingly, the SECReTE motif at the
beginning of the gene (SECReTE27) is maintained in six out of seven hCoVs and SECReTE33, located in the single
encoded TMD, is maintained in five out of seven hCoVs (Supplementary Figure S2A & B and Supplementary
Table S1). Note that in hCoV-229E, there is no SECReTE in the TMD sequence, but there is a SECReTE motif
(SECReTE44 of hCoV-229E) downstream and almost parallel in position to SECReTE33 of SARS-CoV-2.
SECReTE31, located in the in the middle of the S gene, is also maintained in five of seven hCoVs (and in hCoV229E SECReTE38 is 45nt downstream). Only one SARS-CoV-2 S gene motif (SECReTE 29) had no parallel in
any of the other hCoVs. Importantly, position of the abovementioned SECReTEs is maintained even when the
nucleotide and amino acid sequences differ.
Correlation of SECReTE abundance with the %CT content of the CoV genomes
Next, we expanded our analysis to 2993 genomes of Coronaviridae viruses and strains that were organized by
similarity to the hCoVs18 or by their genera (Supplementary Table S4). We plotted the SECReTE score (SECReTE
number/kb) vs. %CT based on these two groupings and found a good correlation between the SECReTE and %CT

in at least some of the groups (R2 = 0.6830, 0.8637, 0.5763 for Alpha-CoV, Beta-CoV, Delta-CoV, respectively)
and a low correlation (R2 = 0.04333) with Gamma-CoV) (Figure 2A). For 229E-like, HKU1-like, NL63-like,
OC43-like, MERS-like, SARS-like and SARS-2-like, respectively, the R2 values were 0.1794, 0.7710, 0.6801,
0.6982, 0.8759, 0.01020 and 0.003998 (Figure 2B). Notably, for some CoV families/genera we observe a wide
variability in SECReTE scores that at the same %CT, which might arise via non-random occurrences (see below).
Alpha-CoVs have the most SECReTEs/kb and at any %CT (Figure 2A), as compared to the other genera, with
hCoV-NL63 being the most extreme (Figure 2B). Overall, nearly all CoV genomes had a SECReTE score of >1
SECReTE/kb.
(+)ssRNA viruses have a higher %CT and SECReTE content than (-)ssRNA viruses
We then identified SECReTE motifs in CDS’s from 463 (+)ssRNA, 119 (-)ssRNA, and 47 ambisense ssRNA
viruses from seventeen different viral families [Figure 3A and Supplementary Tables S5 (vSECReTE scores) & S6
(vSECReTE sequences and position)]. The data shows that (-)ssRNA viruses have a lower SECReTE score as
compared to (+)ssRNA viruses. Note that in this plot we scored genomic segments separately (e.g. for segmented
genome (-)ssRNA viruses, like influenza or ambisense RNA viruses). Thus, segments that lack SECReTEs have a
SECReTE score of ‘0’. To gain further insight, we averaged the SECReTE score for each family or distinct genera
and plotted them vs. %CT (Figures 3B and Supplementary Figure S3). We found a large variability in SECReTE
content amongst (+)ssRNA viral families (e.g. ranging from ~0.3 to ~5 SECReTE/kb). However, all (-)ssRNA and
ambisense viruses examined show, on average, 0.28-0.5 SECReTE/kb. The difference between (+)ssRNA and ()ssRNA viruses was statistically significant (p<2.2 e-16; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for viruses with %CT between
47% to 55%). As before, we found an overall correlation to the %CT (R2 =0.6299). We note, however, that genome
size does not correlate with the SECReTE score (R2 =0.01045) (Figure S4).
To overcome differences in the %CT of different viruses, we tested the significance of SECReTE
appearance in specific viral genomes via permutation analysis by re-shuffling (500 repetitions) the viral genomes
and scoring motif number after each round. By applying permutations, each virus genome is compared to sequences
with exactly the same %CT. While the SECReTE score in (+)ssRNA viruses was significantly higher than expected
by random chance, this was not the case for (-)ssRNA viruses (Table 2). Thus, the ubiquitous and specific presence
of SECReTE elements suggests that they could play a role in RNA translation directly from (+)ssRNA genomes.
Human mRNAs with high SECReTE scores
Because of the connection between SECReTE score and viral biology, we thought that a high SECReTE score
might also be unique to certain human gene families. By screening the human secretome genes (Supplementary
Table S3) we found three gene families with a particularly high SECReTE scores when compared to other genes of
similar size or function (Figure 4). These gene families included the mucins, defensins, and olfactory receptors
(Figure 4), known to be expressed within epithelial cells and olfactory neurons, respectively. These families scored

significantly higher than most other genes (p=0.04 for defensins vs. a random list of similar sized genes; and
p<0.0001 for comparisons of OR vs. GPCRs, or a random list of similar sized genes, and mucins vs. a list of random
genes of similar size, as well as for each group vs. all genes; unpaired t-test).

Discussion
Previously, we identified SECReTE as a pyrimidine-rich cis-acting RNA element prevalent in secretome-encoding
genes from bacterial to human cells and demonstrated its role in facilitating protein secretion from yeast cells6. Here
we demonstrate that SECReTE motifs are not exclusive to cells, but are also prevalent in viral genomes, including
(+)ssRNA, (-)ssRNA, and ambisense RNA viruses (Supplementary Tables S1,4-6). Given the COVID-19
pandemic, we focused primarily on the (+)ssRNA viruses of the Coronaviridae, which includes SARS-CoV-2
(Figure 1A) and other hCoVs. Interestingly, SECReTE motifs are more enriched in the (+)ssRNA viruses, as
opposed to the (-)ssRNA and ambisense RNA viruses (Figure 3A and B), and notably in the hCoVs (Figures 1B
and C). SECReTE motifs are found in hCoV genes encoding either structural or non-structural viral proteins (Figure
1D) and primarily, though not exclusively, in genes for membranal and secreted viral proteins (Figures 1E and F).
We also found that the level of SECReTE abundance per kb correlated well with the percentage of pyrimidines
(%CT) present in the viral genomes within the (+)ssRNA and (-)ssRNA viruses in general (Figure 3). However,
there was variability in this correlation within the hCoVs (Figures 2A and B) and subsequent permutation analyses
revealed that SECReTE occurrence in Coronaviridae and (+)ssRNA viruses is probably non-random (Table 2). In
addition, SECReTE abundance did not correlate with viral genome length (Figure S4).
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we looked for a potential correlation between the SECReTE score to
viral pathogenicity (relative to SARS-CoV-2 and the other hCoVs). While the SECReTE scores of the hCoVs are
largely similar, hCoV NL63 had the highest number of SECReTEs and SECRETEs per kb (Figures 1B & C).
Interestingly, NL63 may be more pathogenic than the other endemic hCoVs, although this supposition is based
upon a very limited number of reports totaling less than 200 cases world-wide19-25, and hence its inclusion in the
highly pathogenic hCoV group is pending more research (Supplementary Figure S1). Overall, we could not form a
definitive association between SECReTE score and hCoV pathogenicity. Interestingly, however, we could begin
identify several potential phenomenon related to SECReTE presence in both viral and human genes. First, we
observed that SECReTE positions within the hCoV Spike protein showed co-occurrence (Supplementary Figure S2
and Supplementary Table S1). This suggests that motif presence could be positionally conserved, although the
mechanism by which this happens (i.e. conservation vs. drift vs. convergence) is not known. Nevertheless, it
suggests a functional requirement for SECReTE in some aspect of either S gene RNA association with membranes
or in Spike protein translation, or perhaps both. Further work is necessary to reveal the role (if any) of SECReTE
motifs in hCoV RNA association with ER membranes or the translation of viral proteins, not only for the S gene,

but for all other structural and non-structural protein-encoding genes containing this motif. Since SECReTE
presence or absence significantly affected the synthesis and secretion of three yeast proteins examined (Suc2,
Hsp150, and Ccw12), as well as an exogenously expressed form of secretion-competent GFP in yeast6, we presume
that the motif may fulfill a similar role in the production of viral proteins. Second, we determined that certain
families of human proteins are enriched with SECReTE motifs more than random occurrence (Figure 4).
Interestingly, these families included mucins and defensins which are secreted from or associated with epithelial
layers that are targeted by hCoVs. This could be coincidence or it could be that host mRNAs and hCoV vRNAs use
the same SECReTE-interacting proteins expressed in these cells. While entirely speculative, it would not be
improbable to think that organization of the VRC on ER membranes and usurpation of host SECReTE-binding
proteins could strongly influence the translation and translocation of secreted proteins, as well as tethering the viral
genome to the ER membrane and the formation of DMVs. A negative impact upon the translation of proteins
involved in innate immunity (e.g. defensins) and barriers to infection (e.g. mucins) alone might be expected to
render cells more sensitive to infection27. Interestingly, both anecdotal preliminary evidence for the onset of
anosmia, which can occur upon OR or olfactory neuron loss, has been recently described for COVID-19 patients28.
Hence the identification of host proteins that interact with hCoV viral RNA elements may prove important not only
for understanding viral biology, but may also uncover druggable targets that interfere with viral propagation.
Overall, our work shows that SECReTE RNA elements are present throughout all biological entities and suggests
that they are likely to be important also for viral replicative cycle.

Methods
SECReTE identification and %CT calculations were performed as previously described6. TMD identification was
performed with TMHMM v2.026. Alignment of the S gene sequence of the seven hCoVs was done using
SnapGene™. Detection of overlap between SECReTE sequences and TMD or within aligned S genes was done
manually. For the permutation analysis, we shuffled (500 times) the coding sequences of selected viruses
genes. The statistical significance of the SECReTE count per virus was calculated as (#successes +1) / (number of
permutations + 1), where #successes is the number of permuted sequences with a SECReTE count higher than the
native genome. Because genes in viruses tend to overlap, redundant SECReTE sequences were merged for
calculation of the SECReTE count.
