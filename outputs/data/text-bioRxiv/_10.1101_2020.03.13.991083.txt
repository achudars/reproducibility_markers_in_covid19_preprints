Abstract.
17 years after the SARS-CoV epidemic, the
world is facing the COVID-19 pandemic.
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named
SARS-CoV-2. Given the most optimistic
projections estimating that it will take over a year
to develop a vaccine, the best short-term strategy
may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for
small molecule interventions. All coronaviruses
utilize a molecular mechanism called −1 PRF to
control the relative expression of their proteins.
Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it
employs a structurally unique three-stemmed
mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of −1
PRF, and that it also harbors a −1 PRF attenuation
element. Altering −1 PRF activity negatively
impacts virus replication, suggesting that this
molecular mechanism may be therapeutically
targeted. Here we present a comparative analysis
of the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
frameshift signals. Structural and functional
analyses revealed that both elements promote
similar rates of −1 PRF and that silent coding
mutations in the slippery sites and in all three
stems of the pseudoknot strongly ablated −1 PRF
activity. The upstream attenuator hairpin activity
has also been functionally retained. Small-angle
x-ray scattering indicated that the pseudoknots in
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 had the same
conformation. Finally, a small molecule
previously shown to bind the SARS-CoV
pseudoknot and inhibit −1 PRF was similarly
effective against −1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2,
suggesting that such frameshift inhibitors may
provide promising lead compounds to counter the
current pandemic.
Introduction
SARS-CoV2, the etiological agent of COVID-19,
is a member of the coronavirus family (1).
Coronaviruses have (+) ssRNA genomes that
harbor two long open reading frames (ORF)
which occupy the 5′ ~ two-thirds of the genomic
RNA (ORF1 and ORF2), followed by several
ORFs that are expressed late in the viral
replication cycle from subgenomic RNAs
(sgRNAs) (Fig. 1A) (2). In general, the
immediate early proteins encoded by ORF1a are
involved in ablating the host cellular innate
immune response, whereas the early proteins

encoded in ORF1b are involved in genome
replication and RNA synthesis. These functions
include generating the minus-strand replicative
intermediate, new plus-strand genomic RNAs,
and subgenomic RNAs which mostly encode
structural, late proteins. ORF1b is out of frame
with respect to ORF1a, and all coronaviruses
utilize a molecular mechanism called
programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1
PRF) as a means to synthesize the ORF2 encoded
proteins (3, 4). −1 PRF is a mechanism in which
cis-acting elements in the mRNA direct
elongating ribosomes to shift reading frame by 1
base in the 5′ direction. The use of a −1 PRF
mechanism for expression of a viral gene was
first identified in the Rous sarcoma virus (5). A
−1 PRF mechanism was shown to be required to
translate ORF1ab in a coronavirus, Avian
Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), two years later
(6). In coronaviruses, −1 PRF functions as a
developmental switch, and mutations and small
molecules that alter this process have deleterious
effects on virus replication (7, 8).
The −1 PRF signal can be broken down into three
discrete parts: the “slippery site”, a linker region,
and a downstream stimulatory region of mRNA
secondary structure, typically an mRNA
pseudoknot [reviewed in (3)]. The primary
sequence of the slippery site and its placement in
relation to the incoming translational reading
frame is critical: it must be N NNW WWZ
(codons are shown in the incoming or 0-frame),
where NNN is a stretch of three identical
nucleotides, WWW is either AAA or UUU, and
Z ≠ G. The linker region is less well-defined, but
typically is short (1 – 12 nt long) and is thought
to be important for determining the extent of −1
PRF in a virus-specific manner. The function of
the downstream secondary structure is to induce
elongating ribosomes to pause, a critical step for
efficient −1 PRF to occur [reviewed in (9)]. The
generally accepted mechanism of −1 PRF is that
the mRNA secondary structure directs elongating
ribosomes to pause with its A- and P-site bound
aminoacyl- (aa-) and peptidyl-tRNAs positioned
over the slippery site. The sequence of the
slippery site allows for re-pairing of the tRNAs to
the −1 frame codons after they “simultaneously
slip” by one base in the 5′ direction along the

mRNA. The subsequent resolution of the
downstream mRNA secondary structure allows
the ribosome to continue elongation of the
nascent polypeptide in the new translational
reading frame. The downstream stimulatory
elements are most commonly H-type mRNA
pseudoknots, so called because they are
composed of two co-axially stacked stem-loops
where the second stem is formed by base pairing
between sequence in the loop of the first-stem
loop, and additional downstream sequence (10).
The SARS-CoV pseudoknot is more complex
because it contains a third, internal stem-loop
element (11–13). Mutations affecting this
structure decreased rates of −1 PRF and had
deleterious effects on virus propagation, thus
suggesting that it may present a target for smallmolecule therapeutics (7, 8). In addition, the
presence of a hairpin located immediately 5′ of
the slippery site has been reported to regulate −1
PRF by attenuating its activity (14). Here, we
report on the −1 PRF signal from SARS-CoV-2.
The core −1 PRF signal is nearly identical to that
of SARS-CoV, containing only a single
nucleotide difference, a C to A. This change maps
to a loop region in the molecule that is not
predicted to affect the structure of the threestemmed pseudoknot. The primary sequence of
the attenuator hairpin is less-well conserved.
However, genetic analyses reveal that both
elements appear to have been functionally
conserved. Conservation of RNA structure is
further supported by the similarity of the smallangle x-ray scattering profiles for the two
pseudoknots, and by the similar antiframeshifting activity of a small-molecule ligand
against both frameshift signals.
Results
Comparative structural analyses of the two −1
PRF signals. The core of the SARS-CoV −1 PRF
signal begins with the U UUA AAC slippery site,
followed by a 6-nt spacer region and then the
three-stemmed
mRNA
pseudoknot
that
stimulates −1 PRF. A second regulatory element,
called the attenuator hairpin, is located 5′ of the
slippery site. Pairwise analysis of the SARS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals revealed
that the sequence of the attenuator hairpin was
less well conserved than the frameshiftstimulating pseudoknot (Fig. 1B). The structure

of the SARS-CoV −1 PRF signal was previously
determined to include a three-stemmed
pseudoknot (11). Using this structure as a guide,
the single C to A base difference between the core
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 −1 PRF signals
(Fig. 1B) which maps to a loop that is not
predicted to alter the structure of the −1 PRF
stimulating element (7) (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the
attenuator hairpin contains six differences in the
nucleotide sequence between the two viruses
(Fig. 1B), and the SARS-CoV-2 element is
predicted to be less stable than its SARS-CoV
counterpart (Fig. 1D). To determine the
importance of each of these elements, a series of
silent coding mutants of both the SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 sequences were constructed to
disrupt the putative attenuators, slippery sites,
and stems 1, 2 and 3 of the pseudoknots (Fig. 1E,
F).
Comparative functional analyses of the two −1
PRF signals.
Standard dual-luciferase assays were used to
monitor −1 PRF activities of the two −1 PRF
signals (15, 16) in cultured human cell lines. For
both of the elements, −1 PRF activity was ~20%
in HEK (Fig. 2A) and ~30% in HeLa (Fig. 2B).
Amino acid sequence silent coding mutation of
the U UUA AAC slippery sites to C CUC AAC
(the incoming 0-frame codons are indicated by
spaces) ablated −1 PRF activity in both cases, to
less than 1% (Fig. 2A, B), demonstrating the
functional conservation of this central feature of
the −1 PRF signal.
To test functional conservation of the threestemmed pseudoknot, a series of silent 0-frame
coding mutations were made to each of the stems
in both the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
frameshift signals and assays were performed in
HEK cells. Disruption of Stem 1 strongly
suppressed the ability of both elements to
promote −1 PRF, decreasing rates to 0.67 ±
0.03% and 0.7 ± 0.1% for SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 respectively, p < 0.0001 (Fig. 2C).
Similarly, disruption of Stem 2 had a strong
negative impact on −1 PRF, decreasing rates to
0.68 ± 0.04% for SARS-CoV and 0.8 ± 0.1% for
SARS-CoV-2, p < 0.0001 (Fig. 2D). In contrast,
while disruption of Stem 3 did decrease −1 PRF
efficiencies, the effects were less severe, although
the decreases were statistically significant (13.1 ±
3

0.9% and 8 ± 1% for SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 respectively, p < 0.0001 (Fig. 2E). These
findings support the hypothesis that structure and
function of the core −1 PRF signals has been
conserved between the two viruses.
Conservation of the 5′ attenuator function.
Prior studies demonstrated the presence of an
element located immediately 5′ of the SARSCoV slippery site that had the ability to decrease
−1 PRF, called the Attenuator Hairpin (14).
Although less well conserved at the primary
sequence level (Fig. 1B, C), addition of this
sequence into the SARS-CoV-2 reporter also
resulted in decreased −1 PRF efficiency: 16 ± 3%
compared to 25 ± 3% without the attenuator
hairpin, p < 0.01, whereas disruption of the
hairpin did not result in decreased efficiency (22
± 4%, p = 0.415) (Fig. 2F). In the control
experiment, the SARS-CoV attenuator also
promoted decreased −1 PRF, albeit to a lesser
extent (20 ± 2% compared to 23 ± 2% without the
attenuator hairpin, p = 0.04, and 24 ± 1% with the
disrupted hairpin, p = 0.716) (Fig. 2G). Thus, the
attenuation function has also been conserved
between the two viruses despite the differences in
primary nucleotide sequences.
Small-molecule frameshift inhibitor of SARSCoV −1 PRF is also active against SARS-CoV2. Based on the strong conservation of the
frameshift signal between SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2, we tested if a frameshift inhibitor
active against the first also retained activity
against the second. We focused on a smallmolecule ligand previously shown to bind to the
SARS-CoV pseudoknot and suppress −1 PRF, 2{[4-(2-methyl-thiazol-4ylmethyl)[1,4]diazepane-1-carbonyl]-amino}-benzoic acid
ethyl ester, hereafter denoted as MTDB (17, 18) .
Comparing the −1 PRF activity from dualluciferase measurements in rabbit reticulocyte
lysates in the presence and absence of MTDB, we
found that 5 μM MTDB reduced −1 PRF activity
by almost 60%, from 36 ± 3% to 15 ± 1% (Fig.
3). This reduction was comparable to, but slightly
smaller than, that seen previously for the SARSCoV pseudoknot, where 0.8 μM MTDB reduced
−1 PRF by roughly 60% (17).

Solution scattering profiles of the SARS-CoV
and
SARS-CoV-2
pseudoknots
are
indistinguishable. Finally, we used small and
wide-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to compare
the solution scattering profiles of the two
pseudoknots, which reflect their structure. The
scattering profiles (intensity as a function of the
scattering vector q) were indistinguishable for lab
purified samples of SARS-CoV (Fig. 4A, blue)
and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4A, red) pseudoknots.
The difference between their scattering profiles is
consistent with 0 at all q (Fig. 4B). The high-q
portion of the profile is sensitive to the finer
molecular details of the structure (19) hence the
similarity of the profiles for the two pseudoknots
indicates their structures are likely the same.
Because SARS-CoV pseudoknots can dimerize
(20), we also performed inline size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) SAXS measurements,
where the RNA was purified by SEC
immediately before x-ray exposure to ensure only
monomers were measured. From inline-SEC
SAXS profiles (Fig. 4A, inset), we determined
the monomer size, parameterized as the radius of
gyration, Rg. We measured the same values for
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknots: Rg =
28.1 ± 0.3 Å and Rg = 28.1 ± 0.2Å, respectively.
The difference profile for this set is also
consistent with 0 for all q (Fig. 4C).
Discussion
These results verify that SARS-CoV-2 does
indeed have a functional −1 PRF site. They also
show that the properties of the frameshift signal
in SARS-CoV-2 are very similar to those of the
frameshift signal in SARS-CoV. Not only was the
level of −1 PRF close to identical for both viruses,
but disrupting stems 1 and 2 in the stimulatory
pseudoknot abolished frameshifting in both
cases, whereas disrupting stem 3 reduced −1 PRF
but did not abolish it in each case. Furthermore,
each frameshift signal featured an attenuator
hairpin that promoted modestly decreased −1
PRF levels, and the global structures of two
pseudoknots as reflected in the SAXS scattering
profiles were virtually identical.
The very close correspondence in the properties
of the frameshift-stimulatory pseudoknots from
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 suggests that other
properties of the former that have been
characterized in previous studies are highly likely

to carry over to SARS-CoV-2. For example,
deletion of stem 3 will likely lead to little or no
change in −1 PRF whereas mutation of the A
bulge in stem 2 will likely abolish −1 PRF (7, 8),
the pseudoknot will likely dimerize via
interactions between loop 2 (20), and suppression
of −1 PRF will most likely attenuate viral
propagation (11). This likely susceptibility of
SARS-CoV-2 to attenuation by suppressing −1
PRF is of particular interest, as it suggests that
targeting −1 PRF may provide a promising
avenue for therapeutic intervention. Previous
work on SARS-CoV found that antisense peptide
nucleic acids could inhibit both −1 PRF and virus
replication (21). The fact that the compound
MTDB, which was found in a computational
search for −1 PRF inhibitors in SARS-CoV (17),
is similarly active at suppressing −1 PRF in
SARS-CoV-2 provides concrete evidence for
small-molecule frameshifting inhibitors in
SARS-CoV-2 and supports the hypothesis that
the frameshift-stimulatory pseudoknot may be an
attractive therapeutic target.
Experimental Procedures
Identification of the SARS-CoV2 −1 PRF
signal and computational methods. The SARSCoV-2 −1 PRF signal was identified from the
complete genome sequence (NCBI Ref Seq
NC_045512.2). The EMBOSS Water pairwise
alignment tool was used to identify sequences in
the SARS-CoV-2 genome most similar to the
SARS-CoV −1 PRF sequence. One hit was
reported between bases 13461 and 13547 of
SARS-CoV-2 that was 98.9% identical to the
original SARS sequence. The SARS-CoV-2
sequence contains a single point mutation from C
to A at base 13533. EMBOSS Water was used to
generate pairwise alignments between sequences
derived from SARS-CoV (GenBank entry
NC_004718.3 begin nt 13361, end nt 13478) and
SARS-CoV-2 (Genbank entry NC_045512.2,
begin nt 13431, end nt 13547).
Preparation
of
plasmids
and
RNA
transcription templates. Plasmids for cell-based
dual-luciferase assays for SARS-CoV-2 were
generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the
pJD2359 plasmid (SARS-CoV pSGDluc reporter
plasmid) (8), introducing a single C to A point
mutation at base 1873, corresponding to the point

mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Q5 Sitedirected mutagenesis kit, NEB). Site directed
mutagenesis primers (Table S1) were
synthesized and purified by IDT. Products were
transformed into DH5α Escherichia coli cells
(NEB) and spread onto LB agar plates containing
50μg/mL carbenicillin. Positive clones were
verified by DNA sequencing (Genewiz). The
frameshift reporter negative controls and reporter
constructs containing silent mutations disrupting
the −1 PRF slippery site (ssM), stem 1 (St1), stem
3 (St3), and attenuator hairpins were constructed
similarly by site-directed mutagenesis. Reporters
containing silent mutations to stem 2 were made
by digesting pJD2257 with SalI and BamHI and
ligating a DNA oligonucleotide insert (IDT)
containing the silent mutations to stem 2 of SARS
and SARS-CoV2 (IDT) into the plasmid using T4
DNA ligase (NEB).
Plasmids for cell-free dual-luciferase assays were
made as described previously (22). Briefly, the
reporter construct was made by cloning the
sequence for Renilla luciferase and SARS-CoV2 frameshift signal in the 0 frame upstream of the
firefly luciferase sequence in the pISO plasmid
(Addgene), with firefly luciferase in the −1
frame. A negative control was made by replacing
part of the slippery sequence with a stop codon,
and a positive control was made without a
frameshift signal and the two luciferases inframe. RNA transcription templates were
amplified from these plasmids by PCR and
transcribed in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase.
Plasmids for producing samples for SAXS were
prepared by ligating an insert containing the
sequences of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
pseudoknots into the BamHI and SpeI sites of the
pMLuc-1 plasmid as described previously (23).
RNA transcription templates were amplified
from these plasmids by PCR, including 3 extra
nucleotides upstream of the pseudoknot and 4
downstream (all U’s). The forward PCR primer
was extended on its 5′ end to include the T7
polymerase
promoter.
The
transcription
templates were then transcribed in vitro by T7
RNA polymerase.
Cell culture and plasmid transfection. Human
embryonic kidney (HEK293T/17) (CRL-11268)
and HeLa (CCL-2) cells were purchased from the

American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,
VA). HEK293T cells were maintained in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM)
(Fisher Scientific 10-013-CV) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Fisher Scientific
26140-079), 1% GlutaMAX (35050-061), 1%
nonessential amino acids (NEAA) (Fisher
Scientific 11140-050), 1% HEPES buffer (Fisher
Scientific 15630-030) and 1× Penicillinstreptomycin (Fisher Scientific 15140-122) at
37°C in 5% CO2. HeLa cells were maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1%
GlutaMAX and 1× Penicillin-streptomycin at
37°C in 5% CO2. HEK293T and HeLa cells were
seeded at 4 × 104 cells per well into 24-well
plates. Cells were transfected 24 hours after
seeding with 500 ng dual luciferase reporter
plasmid using Lipofectamine3000 (Invitrogen
L3000015) per manufacturer’s protocol.
Dual luciferase assays of −1 PRF. The
frameshifting efficiency of the reporter plasmids
in cultured cells were assayed as described
previously (15, 16) using a dual luciferase
reporter assay system kit (Promega). 24 hours
post transfection, cells were washed with 1×
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) then lysed with
1× passive lysis buffer (E194A, Promega). Cell
lysates were assayed in triplicate in a 96-well
plate and luciferase activity was quantified using
a GloMax microplate luminometer (Promega).
Percent frameshift was calculated by averaging
the three firefly or Renilla luciferase technical
replicate reads per sample then forming a ratio of
firefly to Renilla luminescence per sample. Each
sample luminescence ratio was compared to a
read-through control set to 100%. The ratio of
ratios for each sample is the percent frameshift
for the sample. A minimum of three biological
replicates were assayed for each sample, each of
which were assayed in triplicate (technical
replicates). Mean technical replicate values of
each biological replicate are depicted on graphs
with standard error of the mean for biological
replicates. Statistical analyses were conducted
using Student’s t test or one-way analysis of
variance as appropriate using Prism 8 software
(GraphPad).
To measure −1 PRF efficiency in cell-free assays,
2 µg of mRNA from each construct was heated to

65 oC, mixed with 35 µL of nuclease-treated RRL
(Promega) and 0.5 µL of 1 mM amino-acid
mixture lacking Leu and Met, and then incubated
for 90 min at 30oC. The firefly luminescence from
each of the constructs was measured after
incubating 20 µL of each reaction with 100 µL of
Dual-Glo Luciferase reagent (Promega) for 10
min, and then Renilla luminescence was
measured 10 min after adding 100 µL of DualGlo Stop and Glo reagent. The −1 PRF efficiency
was calculated from the ratio of firefly and
Renilla
luminescence,
subtracting
the
background measured from the negative control
and normalizing by the positive control. Eight
independent measurements were made without
MTDB, 4 with MTDB.
SAXS measurements. RNA samples for SAXS
experiments were made by in vitro transcription
of DNA templates followed by ethanol
precipitation of the RNA. To avoid dimerization,
RNA was resuspended in a low-salt solution
(50mM MOPS 10mM KCl pH 7.5). The RNA
was annealed by heating to 95C° for 5 minutes,
then placed on ice. After concentration with a
spin concentrator, a fraction of the RNA was set
aside for inline SEC-SAXS, performed just prior
to x-ray exposure, while the rest was purified by
size exclusion chromatography in a column
equilibrated with the SAXS Buffer (50mM
MOPS 130mM KCl pH 7.5). Selected peak
fractions of these lab-purified samples were then
concentrated to 17.3 µM for the SARS-CoV RNA
and 19.2 µM for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA shown
in the figure. All samples were sent to the
National Synchrotron Light Source II for data
acquisition.
SAXS data were collected at the Life Sciences XRay Scattering Beamline (LIX) at Brookhaven
National Lab using their standard solution
scattering set-up, experimental procedures, and
data-processing packages (24). SEC-SAXS was
performed on a Superdex 200 increase 5/150 GL
column (GE) equilibrated in the SAXS buffer
condition.

Figure 1. Structural comparison of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 −1 PRF signals. A. Cartoon
depicting SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 genome organization including a −1 PRF between ORF1a and
ORF1b. B. Pairwise analysis of the two −1 PRF signals. The attenuator elements and three-stemmed
pseudoknot sequences are boxed as indicated. The U UUA AAC slippery site is underlined. C. Structure
of the SARS-CoV −1 PRF signal (11) is composed of the 5’ slippery site, a 6-nt spacer, and the threestemmed pseudoknot stimulatory element. The single base difference in SARS-CoV-2 (red) maps to the
short loop linking Stems 2 and 3. D. Comparison of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 −1 PRF attenuator
elements. SARS-CoV-2 specific bases are indicated in red. E and F. Silent coding mutations designed to
disrupt the attenuators, slippery sites, and Stems 1, 2 and 3 in the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV −1 PRF
signals respectively.

Figure 2. Functional characterization of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 −1 PRF signals. A and B:
Analyses of silent slippery site mutants. The efficiencies of −1 PRF promoted by the wild-type (U UUA
AAC) and silent slippery site mutant (C CUC AAC) −1 PRF signals were assayed in HEK (panel A) and
HeLA (panel B). ssM denotes silent slippery site mutant. C – E: Analyses of the importance of the three
stems in the -1 PRF stimulating RNA pseudoknot. Silent stem 1 (St-1, C) stem 2 (St-2, D) and Stem 3
(St-3, E) mutants were assayed in HEK cells. F and G. Analyses of the attenuator hairpins. AH denotes
constructs that included attenuator hairpin sequences. AH mutant denotes mutants harboring the silent
coding attenuator hairpin sequences shown in Figs. 1E, F. Assays were performed using dual-luciferase
assays as previously described (15, 16). Each data point represents a single biological replicate comprised
of three technical replicates. Error bars denote S.E.M.
