Abstract:
The human CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that
plays a major role in inflammation and is involved in the pathology of cancer, HIV, and COVID19. Despite its significance as a drug target, the activation mechanism of CCR5, i.e. how
chemokine agonists transduce the activation signal through the receptor, is yet unknown. Here,
we report the cryo-EM structure of wild-type CCR5 in an active conformation bound to the
chemokine super-agonist [6P4]CCL5 and the heterotrimeric Gi protein. The structure provides
the rationale for the sequence-activity relation of agonist and antagonist chemokines. The Nterminus of agonist chemokines pushes onto an aromatic connector that transmits activation to
the canonical GPCR microswitch network. This activation mechanism differs significantly from
other CC chemokine receptors that bind shorter chemokines in a shallow binding mode and have
unique sequence signatures and a specialized activation mechanism.

Main text:
The human CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that
plays a major role in inflammation by recruiting and activating leukocytes(1). CCR5 is also the
principal HIV coreceptor(2), is involved in the pathology of both cancer(3) and
neuroinflammation(4), and has been implicated in the inflammatory complications of COVID19(5, 6). Soon after the discovery of CCR5, it became evident that its natural chemokine ligands
inhibit HIV entry(7), with CCL5 (RANTES) being most efficient, both by blocking the binding
site for the viral glycoprotein gp120 and by promoting CCR5 endocytosis(8). Modifications of
the N-terminal region of CCR5 preceding C10 yielded HIV entry inhibitors with significantly
higher potency(9–11). These analogs belong to a group of over 100 engineered CCL5 Nterminal variants that show striking differences in their anti-HIV, endocytotic, affinity, and
signaling properties ranging e.g. from super-agonist to strong antagonist behavior(10, 11). The
molecular explanation for these N-terminal structure-related differences is currently unclear.
Whereas a good structural understanding has been reached of the activation mechanisms of
class A GPCRs by small-molecule ligands(12), the activation mechanism of the chemokine
receptor subclass is not yet well understood. Inactive structures of a number of chemokine
receptors have been solved including complexes of CCR5 with the engineered chemokine
antagonist [5P7]CCL5(13), the viral gp120•human CD4 complex(14), the HIV inhibitor
maraviroc(15), and other small-molecule antagonists(16). In contrast, currently only three
active-state chemokine receptor complex structures are available: CX3CL1•US28•Nb7(17),
CCL20•CCR6•Go(18), and CXCL8•CXCR2•Gi(19). The viral receptor US28 is constitutively
active and hence does not reveal chemokine-induced activation, and the chemokines CCL20
and CXCL8 adopt a shallow binding mode in which activation apparently involves transmission
of forces directly from the extracellular domain of the receptor. On the other hand, receptors
such as CCR5 have ligands with longer N-termini which likely insert more deeply into the
orthosteric pocket of the receptor (chemokine recognition site 2; CRS2). At least in the case of

CCR5, where agonist and antagonist N-terminal CCL5 variants of the same length exist, crucial
signaling interactions must rather be located within CRS2.
With the aim of elucidating the apparently different activation mechanisms of CC
chemokine receptors and to provide a general structural explanation for the variable
pharmacology of CCL5 N-terminal variants, we solved the structure of wild-type human CCR5
in complex with the super-agonist [6P4]CCL5 and the Gi heterotrimer.
Overall structure of the [6P4]CCL5•CCR5•Gi complex
A stable complex of [6P4]CCL5•CCR5•Gi was obtained by incubating detergent-solubilized
human wild-type full-length CCR5 with the Gi1 heterotrimer and [6P4]CCL5 (Supplementary
Fig. S1). The complex was treated with apyrase to hydrolyze GDP and was further stabilized by
addition of the Fab fragment Fab16(20, 21), which recognizes an interface between the Gα and
Gβγ subunits of the Gi heterotrimer (Supplementary Fig. S2). Single-particle cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis with extensive particle classification yielded a threedimensional density map with a nominal global resolution of 3.1 Å (Fig. 1A, Supplementary
Fig. S3, and Supplementary Table S1). The map is well resolved for most of parts of CCR5, the
[6P4]CCL5 N-terminus, the Gi heterotrimer, and Fab16 (Supplementary Fig. S4). The density
of the globular core of [6P4]CCL5 and the adjacent CCR5 N-terminus and extracellular parts of
the receptor have less-defined density, indicating relative flexibility in these parts of the
structure. Indeed, a 3D variability analysis of the cryo-EM data (Supplementary Video S1) and
molecular dynamics simulations of the atomic model (Supplementary Fig. S5A) reveal a certain
degree of mobility of the [6P4]CCL5 core as well as of the receptor N-terminus, extracellular
loops, TM5, 6 and 7. Apart from a small ~5˚ difference in the orientation, the position of the
[6P4]CCL5 core is very similar to that of [5P7]CCL5 in the inactive [5P7]CCL5•CCR5 complex
(Fig. 1C, 2A). Nevertheless, this minor change in orientation also leads to small (1–2 Å), but
noticeable movements at the extracellular helix ends (Fig. 2B).

The open conformation of the intracellular part of the active CCR5 differs from all inactive
CCR5 structures thereby enabling the binding of the G protein (Fig. 1C): TM6 is moved
outwards from the heptahelical bundle accompanied by further rearrangements of TM5, TM7,
and intracellular loop 4 (ICL4). The moderate outward displacement of TM6 and the
arrangement of Gi relative to CCR5 (Fig. 1A-C) agrees with previous GPCR•Gi complexes(21,
22).
CRS1 interactions
The interactions between [6P4]CCL5 and CCR5 can be separated into the three canonical
chemokine recognition sites (CRS) 1, 1.5, and 2(13, 23). CRS1 consists of the contacts of the
chemokine core with the extracellular side of the receptor and is dominated by electrostatic
interactions. The core of [6P4]CCL5 sits on top of a wide opening in the extracellular part of
the CCR5 transmembrane bundle, which is shaped by two disulfide bridges (C1013.25-C178ECL2,
conserved in Class A GPCRs, and C20N-term-C2697.25, specific of chemokine receptors;
superscripts indicate the GPCRdb numbering scheme(24)) (Fig. 1C). The [6P4]CCL5 strand β1
makes extensive contacts with polar residues in ECL2, while the CCR5 N-terminus directs
towards a shallow grove between the chemokine N-loop and 40s-loop forming further extensive
ionic and polar interactions. Due to missing density, the model of the CCR5 N-terminus could
only be built starting from residue A16. Clear interactions are visible between CCR5 residues
S17 and E18 and the chemokine residues R47 and Q48. To gain insights into the missing Nterminal region, CCR5 residues 1-15 were modelled (Fig. 1D) based on NMR NOE contacts(25)
between wild-type CCL5 and an N-terminal fragment of CCR5 sulfated at residues Y10 and
Y14. These post-translational modifications are important for chemokine affinity(25–28) and
are expected to be present also in insect cell-expressed CCR5(29). The NMR structure of the
CCR5-peptide•CCL5 complex(25) is completely compatible with the cryo-EM structure. The
stability of the modeled interactions was assessed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of
the CCR5/[6P4]CCL5 complex (Supplementary Video S2). The simulations reveal highly

dynamic interactions between sY10 and sY14 of CCR5 and K45, R47 and R17 of [6P4]CCL5
in agreement with the NMR observations(28). In addition, a comparison of MD trajectories
between non-sulfated and sulfated CCR5 indicates that sulfation induces a higher number of
atomic contacts between the chemokine and the receptor N-terminus (Supplementary Fig. S5B),
consistent with the higher affinity of the sulfated form(27).
CRS2 interactions and activation
The N-terminus of [6P4]CCL5 reaches deep into the orthosteric pocket (CRS2) between the
CCR5 7TM bundle. This contrasts with the shallow binding modes observed for the chemokines
in the CCL20•CCR6•Go(18) and CXCL8•CXCR2•Gi(19) complexes (see below). Of note, the
N-terminal residues preceding C10 and C11 of monomeric CCL5 in solution have high
nanosecond flexibility(30). However, they adopt a fixed conformation in the CCR5 complex.
Residues 5-11 form the chemokine site (CS) CS1.5, which acts as a hinge between the
chemokine core and CS2 (formed by residues 0-4 and located at the bottom of CRS2).
Conspicuously, this very end of the [6P4]CCL5 N-terminus inserts several angstrom deeper into
the CCR5 orthosteric pocket than [5P7]CCL5 or the V3-loop of gp120 in the respective inactive
complexes with CCR5 (Fig. 2C), in a pose that partially overlaps with that of the antagonists
maraviroc (Supplementary Fig. S6). Due to this deeper insertion, P3 of [6P4]CCL5 (but not
maraviroc or P3 of [5P7]CCL5) can displace CCR5 M2877.42 and Y1083.32 apparently triggering
the GPCR microswitch network (see below). The different insertion depth is caused by a
markedly different structure of the chemokine hinge residues 5-11 (Fig. 2A-D) – a short helix
in [5P7]CCL5 and an extended coil in [6P4]CCL5. This hinge is presumably the key for the
placement of the chemokine N-terminus into CRS2, which controls receptor activation. In
[6P4]CCL5, D5 of the extended hinge forms an ionic interaction with K261.28 in TM1, whereas
the side chain of the equivalent M5 of [5P7]CCL5 points in the opposite direction forming a
helical turn. Apparently this helical turn is also pushed sideways by unfavorable interactions
between [5P7]CCL5 L7 and K261.28 (Fig. 2D). Very similar interactions and conformations are

present in the inactive gp120•CCR5 complex, with F315, R313, and P311 taking the roles of
[5P7]CCL5 L7, M5, and P3, respectively.
The structural finding that the CCL5 CS1.5 hinge conformation controls the insertion depth
of residues 0-4 and thereby the activation state of CCR5 is corroborated by a statistical analysis
of the pharmacological properties of CCL5 N-terminal amino acid variants. Currently, ~140 of
these have been characterized for Ca-signaling (Supplementary Table S2), CCR5
internalization, and anti-HIV activity(11). A sequence analysis shows that residues 0-3 (highest
abundance: QGPL) and 8, 9 (highest abundance: QV) are highly similar between 83 low- and
34 high-Ca-signaling N-terminal variants (Fig. 2E). The latter is not surprising since the
selection libraries were to some extent biased towards these residues(11). In contrast, strong
differences are observed for residues 4-7: for agonist variants the small, hydrophilic or
negatively charged amino acids S, Q, G, D dominate, whereas antagonist variants contain mostly
the large hydrophobic amino acids L, M, W, L. Apparently, the small hydrophilic residues direct
the hinge towards K261.28 in TM1, whereas the large hydrophobic residues make the hinge
collapse to a helical turn. In agreement with their agonist pharmacology, both [6P4]CCL5 and
wild-type CCL5 as well as the other major CCR5 agonist chemokines CCL3 (MIP1α) and CCL4
(MIP1β) contain an aspartic acid at positions 5 or 6 (Fig. 2E), which strengthens the extended
hinge by forming a salt bridge to K261.28.
As compared to [5P7]CCL5, the deeper binding pose of [6P4]CCL5 relocates its N-terminal
pyroglutamate (PCA) group close to Y2516.51 and Q1945.38 (Fig. 2B) and our molecular
dynamics simulations show that these groups interact through water-mediated hydrogen bonds
(Supplementary Fig. S7). The placement of residue P3 of [6P4]CCL5 (Fig. 3) forces the
relocation of M2877.43 in the receptor, which is accompanied by noticeable local changes in the
backbone of TM7 (Supplementary Fig. S8) that bring the intracellular half of this helix towards
the receptor core. This movement allows H2897.45 to push on W2486.48, possibly assisting the
relocation of TM6 (Fig. 3A). P3 also lays on top of an ‘aromatic connector’ formed by CCR5

residues Y1083.32, F1093.33, F1123.36, and Y2516.51 (Fig. 3B), forcing the movement of Y1083.32
and resulting in a cascade of aromatic side chain relocations that transmit the activation signal
to the receptor core. This allows the switch of the PIF motif (P2065.50, I1163.40, and Y2446.44) to
an active conformation (Fig. 3D) and the large-scale movement of TM6. The relocation of TM6
and TM7 coincides with local structural changes in the NPxxY motif (Fig. 3C) leading to the
formation of the conserved water-mediated interaction between Y2977.53 and Y2145.58,(31) and
the opening of the binding pocket for H5 of Gi, which includes R1263.50 in the 'open'
conformation of the intra-helical ionic lock of the DRY motif (Fig. 3E and Supplementary
Figure S9).
Gi interactions
The binding interface of Gi to CCR5 is mediated exclusively by the Gα subunit
(Supplementary Fig. S10) and can be divided into two main regions: the rim and the core (Fig.
4A and Supplementary Fig. S11). The rim contains two clearly separated parts (Fig. 4B): a
'proximal' side formed by the end of the αN helix (αNβ1) and nearby beta strands (β2β3) in Gα
and ICL2 in the receptor, and a 'distal' side formed by beta strands (α4β6) in Gα and ICL3 in the
receptor. In addition, the rim also includes interactions between α5 in Gi and ICL2/3 of the
receptor. The core of the CCR5/Gi complex interface is formed exclusively by interactions of
α5 in Gi (Fig. 4A,C). Here, the Gi α5 helix interacts with the cytoplasmic sides of TM2, TM3,
and TM5 in one side of the core binding pocket, while the C-terminal hook of α5 (residues 352354) leans towards TM6 and ICL4.
These interfaces are common to all GPCR/G protein complexes, as they arise from the
common overall relative orientation of the bound components. However, analysis of the
currently available complexes reveals that the precise location and nature of the individual
interface contacts vary to a certain degree (Supplementary Fig. S12). At the proximal rim of the
interface, contacts are mostly hydrophobic and consistent with other Gi complexes. At the distal
rim, we observe several ionic interactions absent in other structures. However, the most

noticeable differences lie in the core region of the binding interface, where we observe different
contacts between the hook of α5 (the last three C-terminal residues of Gi) and ICL4 of CCR5.
Interestingly, this is due to a distinct conformation of ICL4 of CCR5 in which G3018.47 and
E3028.48 slightly relocate compared to other GPCR/Gi complexes, resulting in a different set of
interactions between E3028.48 and the hook of α5 (Fig. 4B). The varying conformation of the
short ICL4 illustrates the structural plasticity of this domain among Gi-binding GPCRs
(Supplementary Fig. S13 and S14).
Binding modes and activation mechanisms of long- vs. short-tail CC chemokines
The comparison between our structure and the inactive [5P7]CCL5•CCR5 complex(13)
allows us to precisely pinpoint the activation mechanism of CCR5 by a chemokine agonist (Fig.
5A). The overall binding poses of the [5P7]CCL5 antagonist(13) and the [6P4]CCL5 agonist
are similar, with the globular core of the chemokine held by the receptor N-terminus and ECL2
and the chemokine N-terminus reaching deep into the receptor transmembrane bundle.
However, despite having the same 10-residue length, the N-termini of the two CCL5 derivatives
differ in their amino acid sequences. This results in different chemokine/receptor interactions in
this region: small, hydrophilic, or negatively charged residues in sequence positions 4-5 of
[6P4]CCL5 lead to a straight hinge conformation that pushes residue P3 against the bottom of
CRS2. In contrast, the large hydrophobic residues at these positions in [5P7]CCL5 force the
hinge into a turn structure thereby making P3 recede. The more deeply inserted P3 of
[6P4]CCL5 pushes onto the aromatic connector and residue M2877.43 thereby triggering the
canonical activation switches resulting in the relocation of TM6/5/7 and the stabilization of the
receptor active conformation. Notably, point mutations of the aromatic connector residues
Y1083.32, F1093.33, and F1123.36 strongly reduce the efficacy of chemokine ligands while
preserving their affinity(32). The highly conserved (~70% in non-olfactory human Class A
GPCRs) residue W2486.48 lies at the center of these conformational changes, connecting the
rearrangements at H2897.45 and Y2446.44 and, thus, the large-scale relocation of TM7 and TM6.

We expect that, based on their N-terminal sequence, other identified CCR5 agonist or
antagonist chemokines feature respective similar deeper (6P4[CCL5]-active-like) or less deep
(5P7[CCL5]-inactive-like) positions of their N-terminal ends in CRS2. Also, using our structure
as a template, we modeled the wild-type agonist CCL5 bound to CCR5 (Supplementary Fig.
S15 and Supplementary Video S3). CCL5 – as the [6P4]CCL5 agonist – features an aspartate in
its N-terminus (D6) able to interact with K261.28. In CCL5, Y3 could be playing the role of P3
in [6P4]CCL5 by engaging the aromatic connector and M2877.42 (Fig. 5A). In the related
chemokines CCL3 and CCL4, the aspartates at position 5 and the bulky residues at position 2
can carry out analogous functions.
The activation mechanism in CCL5/CCR5, in which the N-terminus of the chemokine
reaches deep into the transmembrane bundle, differs substantially from that of CCL20/CCR6,
where a much shorter CCL20 adopts a shallower binding pose and engages a non-canonical
activation mechanism(18) (Fig. 2D, 5B). Thus, CC chemokine receptors can apparently be
activated through two very different mechanisms by 'long' and 'short' chemokines. But what are
the molecular features in the receptor that determine the type of activation? A phylogenetic
analysis of CCR chemokine receptors (Supplementary Fig. S16) puts CCR5 and CCR6 into
distinct distant subgroups. A more detailed sequence comparison of key residues in the
activation mechanism shows that CCR chemokine receptors can be divided into two main
groups according to the nature of the residue at position 6.48 (W vs Q) and, to some extent, of
the aromatic connector (Fig. 5C). Remarkably, CC chemokine receptors featuring the conserved
W6.48 (CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, and CCR8) tend to be more promiscuous and
preferentially recognize chemokines with longer N-termini (9-14 residues) (Fig. 5C). On the
other hand, CC chemokine receptors featuring Q6.48 (CCR6, CCR9, CCR7, and CCR10) bind to
only a few (1-2) chemokines with short N-termini (4-9 residues). Interestingly, although position
6.48 allows for a certain degree of variability in human Class A GPCRs (70% W; 15% F; 5%

Y; 10% other), a Q at this position is exclusive of this subgroup of chemokine human receptors,
supporting the uniqueness of this ‘shallow’ activation mechanism.
Conclusion
The structure of CCR5 in an active conformation allows us to elucidate a novel activation
pathway of CC chemokine receptors by a chemokine agonist. In CCR5 and related receptors
(CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, and CCR4), the respective cognate chemokines have long N-termini and
bind deep into the orthosteric pocket (CRS2) thereby triggering the rearrangement of an
aromatic connector in TM3 and TM6 and of the TM7 backbone. W6.48 lies at the center of these
conformational changes connecting the receptor activation pathways through TM7 and TM6. In
contrast, a subgroup of CC chemokine receptors (CCR6, CCR7, CCR9, and CCR10) harbor a
Q residue at this position, a unique feature in human Class A GPCRs. The cognate chemokines
of these receptors have shorter N-termini featuring a shallow binding mode and a specialized
mode of activation. We expect that our findings will help to rationalize the relationship between
sequence, structure, and activity of chemokines and their receptors and aid drug discovery.

Methods
Protein expression and purification
The wild-type human CCR5 gene containing a C-terminal 3C cleavage site followed by a
FLAG-tag was cloned into the pFastBac1 vector and expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9
insect cells using the baculoviral infection system. CCR5 expression and membrane preparation
were performed as described(15). Membranes from 1-L culture of Sf9 cells were resuspended
in 10 ml lysis buffer containing 2 mg/ml iodoacetamide, and EDTA-free complete protease
inhibitor cocktail tablets, and incubated at 4°C for 1 hour. Then membranes were solubilized by
supplementing 0.5 % LMNG at 4°C for 3 hours. The soluble fraction was isolated by
centrifugation at 140,000 g and incubated with 1 ml of M2 Anti-FLAG affinity resin overnight
at 4°C. The latter column was washed with 10 column volumes (CV) of washing buffer 1 (25
mM Hepes, 400 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% LMNG (w/v), pH 7.5), followed by 10 CV of
washing buffer 2 (25 mM Hepes, 400 mM NaCl, 2 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1%
LMNG, pH 7.5) and subsequently washed with another 6 CV of washing buffer 1. The receptor
was eluted with 3 CV of elution buffer consisting of 25 mM Hepes, 400 mM NaCl, 0.01%
LMNG, 200 µg/ml FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK), pH 7.5.
The DNA construct of [5P14]CCL5 cloned into a pET32a vector was a generous gift of Prof.
LiWang. The DNA sequence of [6P4]CCL5 was obtained by mutating [5P14]CCL5 using
standard QuickChange PCR. [6P4]CCL5 with enterokinase-cleavable N-terminal a thioredoxin
fusion and hexa-histidine tags was expressed in the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain cultured in
Lysogeny broth media. Protein production was induced with 1 mM isopropyl β-Dthiogalactopyranoside when OD600 reached 0.7-0.8. After induction cells were grown for 20 h
at 22°C and then harvested by centrifugation. 10 g of the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 ml
of resuspension buffer (50 mM Tris, 6 M guanidinium HCl, 200 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and lysed
using a French press. The supernatant was isolated by centrifugation at 27,000g for 1 h and
applied to a 5 ml HisTrap column. The column was washed with 10 CV of resuspension buffer

and eluted with 3 CV of 60 mM NaOAc, 200 mM NaCl, 6 M guanidinium HCl. 20 mM βmercaptoethanol was added to the elution fraction and incubated for 1 hour. The denatured
protein was added dropwise into 250 ml of folding buffer (550 mM L-arginine hydrochloride,
20 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM reduced glutathione, 0.1 oxidized glutathione,
pH 8.0) and incubated overnight at 4°C. The solution was concentrated (MWCO 10 kDa) and
dialyzed in 20 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0. To cleave the fusion tags,
enterokinase (NEB) was added, and the solution was incubated for 24 hours at room
temperature. The protein was separated from the fusion tag using an acetonitrile gradient on a
C4 reversed phase chromatography column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) and then lyophilized. The
lyophylisate was resuspended in 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. The N-terminal amino acid
of [6P4]CCL5 glutamine (Q0) was cyclized at 37°C for 48 hours.
The human Gαi subunit (Gαi1) with an N-terminal TEV protease-cleavable deca-histidine
tag was expressed in the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain and purified as described(21).
The transducin heterotrimer was isolated from the rod outer segment of bovine retina (W L
Lawson Company) and Gβ1γ1 was separated from Gαt with Blue Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE
Healthcare) as described(21). The Gαi1β1γ1 heterotrimer (Gi) was prepared by mixing equimolar
amounts of Gαi1 and Gβ1γ1 and incubated at 4°C for 1 h shortly before use for CCR5-Gi complex
formation.
Fab16 was produced by papain digestion of IgG16 as described(21).
Formation of the [6P4]CCL5•CCR5•Gi•Fab16 complex
Pooled fractions of CCR5 eluted from the anti-FLAG resin and a molar excess of Gi
heterotrimer were mixed together and incubated for 30 minutes. Then an equimolar amount of
[6P4]CCL5 together with 25 mU/ml apyrase were added and incubated for another 2 hours. The
complex was mixed with molar excess (1:1.4) of Fab16 and further incubated for at least 1 h.
The mixture of [6P4]CCL5•CCR5•Gi and Fab16 was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra
concentrator (MWCO 100 kDa) and loaded onto a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column

for size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, 150 mM
NaCl, 0.01% LMNG, pH 7.5. The protein quality of each fraction was evaluated by SDS-PAGE
(Supplementary Fig. S1A,B). Fractions showing good purity and complex integrity were pooled
together and concentrated for EM grid preparation.
Cryo-EM sample preparation and image acquisition
For cryo-EM, 3.5 µL at 2.5 mg/ml sample was directly applied to glow-discharged 200 mesh
carbon grids (Quantifoil R1.2/1.3). Grids were immediately plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using
a FEI Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a blotting time of 3 s. The grids were
screened for ice thickness and particle distribution using Glacios Cryo-TEM operated at 200
kV. Images were acquired from the selected grid using a Glacios Cryo-TEM (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) operated at 200 kV equipped with a Gatan K3 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan
Inc.). Automated data collection was carried out using SerialEM with a set of customized scripts
enabling automated low-dose image acquisition(33, 34), and online pre-screened during data
collection using FOCUS(35). Movie stacks of 40 frames were obtained with a defocus range
of -1.0 to -2.0 µm at a magnification of 45000x (nominally 36000x) and the K3 detector operated
in super-resolution mode (super-resolution pixel size, 0.556 Å). Each movie had a total
accumulated dose exposure of ~49 e/Å2. A total of 2586 image stacks were collected for the
[6P4]CCL5•CCR5•Gi•Fab16 complex.
Cryo-EM data processing
Contaminated micrographs were removed manually. Patch motion correction and Patch CTF
parameter estimation were performed using algorithms implemented in CryoSparc v2.15.0(36).
After sorting, micrographs with estimated resolution worse than 6.0 Å were discarded. The
remaining motion-corrected summed images with dose-weighting were used for all other image
processing in cryoSPARC. Approximately 2.6 million particles were auto-picked and subjected
to several rounds of reference-free 2D classification to remove false positive particles. A total
of 345,458 particles from 3D classes that demonstrated clear structural features were combined

and subjected to 3D refinement, which led to a reconstruction at 3.6 Å resolution. Local
refinement with a soft mask to exclude the density of the Gα α-helical domain and detergent
micelle improved the overall resolution to 3.1 Å.

(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.032466v1.full.pdf). The solvent and
micelle were excluded by applying a soft mask. The 3DVA was then run with this mask using
three variability components and a low-pass filter resolution of 5 Å.
Reported resolutions calculated with a soft shape mask are based on the gold-standard
Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) using the 0.143 criterion. The local resolution was determined
using ResMap(37).
Model building and refinement
The crystal structures of the Gi heterotrimer (PDB ID: 5KDO), Fab16 (PDB ID: 6QNK and
the [5P7]CCL5•CCR5 complex (PDB ID: 5UIW) were used as initial templates for model
building. The models were docked into the 3D map as rigid bodies in Chimera(38). The
[6P4]CCL5 N-terminus (up to the residue 8) was built ab initio. The remaining part of
[6P4]CCL5 was taken from the 5UIW structure. Several rounds of manual building were
performed in Coot(39). The model was finalized by refinement in Phenix 1.18.2.(40) against the
3.1 Å cryo-EM map. Structural figures were prepared in Chimera and PyMOL
(https://pymol.org/2/). The refinement statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.
Amino acid sequence analysis
The analysis of N-terminal sequence similarity of the natural amino acid CCL5 variants
(Supplementary Table S2) was carried using WebLogo(41).

GTPγS test
The purified [6P4]CCL5•CCR5•Gi complex with or without Fab16 was incubated with
100 µM GTPγS in 25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% LMNG, pH 7.5 for 1 h at 4 °C
followed by SEC analysis on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 monitoring the protein intrinsic
tryptophan fluorescence with the excitation wavelength at 280 nm and emission wavelength
350 nm (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations
CCR5 N-terminal residues 1-25 were built with Modeller v9.16(42) using as templates i)
residues 1-14 in the NMR solution structure of a doubly-sulfated (at Y10 and Y14) N-terminal
segment of CCR5 bound to CCL5 (PDB ID: 6FGP) and ii) residues 25-320 in our
[6P4]CCL5•CCR5•Gi cryo-EM model. The chemokines were used as a guide for the structural
alignment of the templates. Secondary structure helical restraints were added to residues 21-24
of CCR5. Cysteine bridges in CCR5 (C20-C2697.24 and C1013.25-C17845.50) and in [6P4]CCL5
(C10-C34 and C11-50) were explicitly defined during model building. All models were
subjected to 300 iterations of variable target function method optimization and thorough
molecular dynamics and simulated annealing optimization and scored using the discrete
optimized protein energy potential. The 20 best-scoring models were analyzed visually, and a
suitable model (in terms of low score and overall structure) was selected (Figure 1D, right
panel).
This model of CCR5 (residues 1-320) bound to [6P4]CCL5 was used for molecular
dynamics simulations of the non-sulfated and sulfated (Y10 and Y14) forms. Coordinates were
first pre-processed using VMD1.9.3(43). The receptor-ligand complex (i.e. CCR5-[6P4]CCL5
or CCR5-CCL5) was then embedded into a 90 Å x 90 Å lipid bilayer composed of 80% 1palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 20% cholesterol. The system was
solvated with explicit water molecules, neutralized, and its ionic strength was adjusted using the
CHARMM-GUI builder(44). Disulfide bridges were explicitly defined between: C50-C11 and

C34-C10 in CCL5 or [6P4]CCR5, and C1013.25-C178, and C20-C2697.25 in CCR5. Except for
CCR5 residues D762.50, E2837.39, and E3028.48, which were protonated, all titratable residues of
CCR5 and CCL5 were left in their dominant protonation state at pH 7.0. Prior to production
runs, the geometry of the system was optimized by energy minimization and further relaxed by
a sequence of equilibration steps where harmonic positional restraints were applied to all Cα
atoms of the protein, and gradually released throughout the equilibration. In the last equilibration
step (i.e. before completely releasing all protein restraints), water, ion and lipids were allowed
to diffuse without restraints during 50 ns to allow for adequate equilibration of the lipid mixture.
Upon equilibration was completed, five independent trajectories of each system were spawned
from the last snapshot of the equilibrated trajectory using a random seed. Production simulations
for each replica were run in the NPT ensemble at 1,013 bar and 310 K for 500 ns each. All
simulations were run using Gromacs v2020(45) with the CHARMM36m force field(46).
Gromacs v2020 and VMD1.9.31, were used to post process and analyze all trajectories. MD
simulation figures were rendered using VMD1.9.3, and the R ggplot2 library(47).
The equilibrated model [6P4]CCL5 bound to CCR5 was used to model the binding pose of
the wild type CCL5. The sequence of CCL5 was threaded on [6P4]CCL5 (6P4:
QGPPGDIVLACC / CCL5: SPYSSDTTP-CC) and steric clashes were relieved using the
molecular graphics software PyMOL. Using this structure as a template, residues 1-9 of CCL5
and all residues 8 Ångstrom around Y3 of CCL5 were re-modeled with Modeller v9.16 using
the protocol described above. The stability of the resulting binding pose was assessed by
molecular dynamics simulations using the protocol described above.
A list of simulations performed in this work is given in Supplementary Table S3. Molecular
dynamics simulations were performed at the Paul Scherrer Institute computing cluster and at the
Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS).
Electrostatic potentials were calculated using the APBS method(48) as implemented in
PyMOL using a concentration of 0.150 M for the +1 and 1 ion species. The biomolecular surface
