Abstract
Respiratory virus infection is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Activation of the
Jak-Stat pathway by Interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-​α/β​) in lung epithelial cells is critical for
innate immunity to respiratory viruses. Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that
transcriptional regulation by IFN-​α/β required the formation of Interferon-stimulated gene
factor-3 (ISGF-3) complex consisting of Stat1, Stat2, and Irf9 transcription factors. Furthermore,
IFN ​α/β receptor activates multiple signal transduction pathways in parallel to the Jak-Stat
pathway and induces several transcription factors at mRNA levels resulting in the secondary and
tertiary rounds of transcription. Transcriptional factor profiling in the transcriptome and RNA
analysis revealed that Early growth response-1 (Egr-1) was rapidly induced by IFN-​α/β and
Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands in multiple cell types. Studies in mutant cell lines lacking
components of the ISGF-3 complex revealed that IFN-​β induction of Egr-1 was independent of
Stat1, Stat2, or Irf9. Activation of the Mek/Erk-1/2 pathway was implicated in the rapid induction
of Egr-1 by IFN-​β in serum-starved mouse lung epithelial cells. Interrogation of multiple
microarray datasets revealed that respiratory viruses including coronaviruses regulated Egr-1
expression in human lung cell lines. Furthermore, Egr-1 inducible genes including transcription
factors, mediators of cell growth, and chemokines were differentially regulated in the human lung
cell lines after coronavirus infection, and in the lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients. Rapid
induction by interferons, TLR ligands, and respiratory viruses suggests a critical role for Egr-1 in
antiviral response and inflammation with potential implications for human health and disease.

Introduction

Interferons (IFNs) are pleiotropic cytokines that play a central role in innate and adaptive
immunity (1,2). There are 3 major types of interferons. The type I interferons consists of
IFN-alpha/beta (IFN-​α/β​). type II interferon represented by interferon-gamma (IFN-​γ), and
type III interferons represented by interferon lambda (IFN- ​λ​). The biological effects of IFN are
mediated mainly by the rapid and dramatic changes in gene expression (3)). Type I IFN signaling
involves the binding of IFN-​α/β to its receptor (IFNAR) and activation of receptor-associated
Janus protein tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Tyk2 and the phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2 to form
a heterodimer. This heterodimer associate with the Interferon responsive factor 9 (Irf9) to form
the interferon-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF-3) complex on interferon-stimulated response
elements (ISRE) in the promoters of type I IFN responsive genes to regulate transcription (1,2,4).
Stat1 homodimer or heterodimer of Stat1/Stat2 can also bind to Gamma activated sequence
(GAS) in the promoter and regulate transcription of some type I IFN responsive genes (1,4). In
addition to this classical canonical Jak-Stat pathway, non-canonical pathways involving Stat2,
Irf9, and unphosphorylated ISGF-3 components in the regulation of gene expression have been
described (5). Furthermore, several signal transduction pathways are activated by IFN receptors
in parallel to Jak-Stat including extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk-1/2) and
phosphoinositide 3’-kinase/Akt pathways (6,7). The first wave of Interferon signaling is followed
by induction of transcription factors such as Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) that sustain the
secondary and tertiary transcriptional responses. TLR recognition of pathogens by immune cells
results in the production of multiple cytokines such as IFN-​α/β​, Tumor Necrosis Factor-​α
(TNF-​α​), and Interleukin-​β (IL-1​β​) in innate immunity (8). Activation of multiple signal

transduction pathways and cross-talk between the pathways enables fine-tuning of gene
expression in innate immunity (9). Cross-talk between TNF-​α and IFN signaling pathways
regulate inflammatory gene expression to influence the immune responses (10,11​). ​Clinical
significance of the balance between immune modulation and inflammation in signal transduction
pathways has been demonstrated in a variety of autoimmune diseases (12,13).
Early growth response 1 (human EGR1/ mouse Egr1; referred in this manuscript as Egr-1)
belongs to a family of immediate-early response genes that contain a conserved zinc finger
DNA-binding domain and binds to a GC-rich sequence in the promoters of target genes (14). A
variety of signals, including serum, growth factors, cytokines, and hormones stimulate Egr-1
expression (15,16). Egr-1 has been shown to play an important role by regulating inflammatory
gene expression in a variety of lung diseases and in mouse lung injury models including asthma,
emphysema, airway inflammation, and pulmonary fibrosis (17-19). Ischemia-mediated activation
of Egr-1 triggers the expression of pivotal regulators of inflammation including the chemokine,
adhesion receptor, and pro-coagulant gene expression (20). Egr-1 stimulates chemokine
production in interleukin-13 mediated airway inflammation, and remodeling in the lung (21).
High levels of expression of Egr-1 and Egr-1 inducible genes were reported in atherosclerosis, an
inflammatory disease (22). Egr-1 may have a potential role in liver injury and in acute
pancreatitis (23-25). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction of Egr-1 was mediated by the activation
of Erk-1/2 pathway and serum response elements (26). In this study, transcription factor profiling
in interferon-mediated gene expression data sets and RT-PCR revealed that Egr-1 was rapidly
induced by IFN-​α/β and TLR ligands in multiple cell types. Studies in mouse and human
fibroblast mutant cell lines revealed that Egr-1 induction by type I interferons was independent of

transcription factors Stat1, Stat2 or Irf9​. Furthermore, the regulation of Egr-1 by IFN-​β was
mediated by the activation of the Erk-1/2 pathway in serum-starved mouse lung epithelial cells.
Respiratory pathogens including coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1 and 2) and influenza viruses
regulated the expression of Egr-1 in human lung cell lines and in lung biopsies and peripheral
blood cells of COVID-19 patients, These studies suggest that the regulation of Egr-1 may play an
important role in the antiviral response and inflammatory disease.

were plated at 60-70% density and maintained in full medium for a day. Cells were incubated in
serum-free medium for another 24 hours. Cells were treated with TNF-​α (20 ng/ml) or IFN-​β
(1000U/ml) for the indicated time. Cytokines were purchased from PBL Assay Science (Nutley,
NJ). RAW 264.7 cells were treated with PolyIC (10​µ​g/ml)), LPS (10ng/ml) or IFN-​β

Results and Discussion
​Regulation of Egr-1 by Interferons and Toll-Like Receptor (TLR ) ligands ​The role of

phosphorylation cascade and activation of the Jak-Stat pathway in IFN​−α/β signaling is well
established (1,2). ​In addition, inducible transcription factors such as Irf1, Irf2, Irf7 also play an
important role in sustaining and modulating the IFN-​α/β ​signaling (4,5). Transcription factor
profiling in the transcriptome provides novel insights into the functional organization and connectivity
in signal transduction pathways in eukaryotic cells (35). A large number of microarray studies on
interferon-regulated gene expression were limited by factors such as cell type, long delay after
treatment (2-24 hours) or treatment in cell culture media with high serum. These studies may have
missed earlier dynamic changes in transcription factors and growth-regulated genes. In order to
identify novel inducible transcription factors regulated by Interferon ​α/β​, gene expression datasets
representing early time points (0.5-2 hours) were examined (27,29). A wide variety of transcription
factors were induced by IFN-​α/β in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and in
Huh7 hepatoma cells (Figures 1A and 1B). Several metallothionein (MT) isoforms were induced in
the early transcription response by IFN-​α/β in Huh7 liver cells. Metals and inflammatory stimuli
are the major inducers of metallothionein in the lung and liver. Early growth response-1 (Egr-1) was
rapidly induced by IFN-​α/β in both cell types and selected for further studies. RNA expression
studies in mouse lung epithelial (MLE-Kd) and human fibrosarcoma (2fTGH) cell lines confirmed
that IFN-​α/β induced Egr-1 (Figure 2A and 2B). These results were consistent with previous
studies in human fibroblasts (15). TNF-​α induction of Egr-1 was much higher than IFN ​α/β in
2fTGH cells (Figure 2B). Interestingly, TNF-​α but not IFN-​α induced Egr-1 mRNA in Hela cells
suggesting differential pathway regulation (15). Furthermore, IFN-​λ induction of Egr-1 was higher

than with IFN-​α/β in Huh7 cells (Figure 2C). TLR recognition of viral and bacterial components
such as double-stranded RNA (Poly IC) and LPS activate diverse signal transduction pathways,
stimulate the production of type I Interferons and activate a large number of genes including
interferon-stimulated gene expression (36). TLR4 ligand (LPS) and TLR3 ligand (Poly IC) induced
Egr-1 mRNA in RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cells. Interestingly, LPS treatment resulted in the
rapid and enhanced activation compared with Poly IC or IFN-​β treatment in RAW 264.7 cells
(Figure 3A). Time-course experiments in bone marrow derived-macrophages (BMDM) revealed
distinct Egr-1 gene expression profiles for each treatment (Figures 3B-3D). These studies revealed
that cytokines and TLR ligands use multiple and distinct signal transduction pathways to induce Egr-1
gene expression. ​Factors such as ​diversity, intensity and duration of the signal transduction pathways
might account for the variation in Egr-1 expression levels in response to different cytokines and TLR
ligands.

Regulation of Egr-1 by IFN-β
​ was independent of Stat1 or ISGF-3 components and

mediated by the activation of Erk-1/2 pathway
IFN-​α/β activates transcription factor complexes including Stat1 homodimer, Stat1-Stat2
heterodimer, and Stat1-Stat2-Irf9 trimeric complex (ISGF-3) that are involved in gene regulation
(1,2). However, IFN-​γ− ​mediated induction of Egr-1 was Stat1-independent in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (34). Studies in wild-type and Stat1-KO mouse fibroblasts showed that IFN-​α/β
induction of Egr-1 was independent of Stat1 (Figure 4A). In contrast, Irf1 induction by IFN-​α/β
was strictly Stat1-dependent. Furthermore, Egr-1 induction was 3-fold higher in Stat1-mull cells
compared with wild-type cells. This enhanced expression of Egr-1was also observed in Stat1 KO
fibroblasts in response to IFN-​γ (34). Studies in mutant cells lacking Stat1 (U3A) Stat2 (U6A) and

Irf9 (U2A) demonstrated that IFN-​β induction of Egr-1 was independent of ISGF-3 components
(Figure 4B). TNF–​α and TLR ligands activate several Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathways such as Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38
(37). Activation of the Erk-1/2 pathway leading to the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as
Elk1 and Srf1 was implicated in the rapid induction of Egr-1 in response to multiple stimuli (26,38).
Western blot analysis revealed that IFN-​β rapidly activated Erk-1/2 within 30 minutes in
serum-starved MLE-Kd cells (Figure 5A). Furthermore, pretreatment with Mek inhibitor (U0126)
inhibited the induction of Egr-1 mRNA (Figure 5B). Pretreatment with an equal volume of DMSO
(vehicle) has no significant effect on Egr-1induction. Activation of Jak1 and ​MAPK-interacting kinase
(Mnk1) were required for the ​activation of Erk-1/2 in IFN-​β signaling (39,40). There are technical
complications in the analysis of Erk-1/2 phosphorylation and activation in cell lines including
constitutive activation in transformed cells as well as cell culture conditions such as serum and
nutrients (39-41). Erk-1/2 activates transcription factors such as Elk1 and Srf1 that bind to Ets and
serum response elements (SRE) respectively, and mediate transcriptional activation of Egr-1 in
response to serum and LPS (26,38). Mouse Egr-1 gene promoter contains multiple SRE elements as
well as Activator protein (AP1), Cyclic AMP response (CRE), and Ets elements upstream of the
transcription start site (Figure 5C). Activation of Srf1 and Elk1 by phosphorylation and binding of
Srf1 and Elk1 to the Egr-1 gene promoter in response to IFN-​β in MLE-Kd cells remains to be
established. Expression of Srf1 enhanced the mRNA levels of several interferon-stimulated genes in
response to Interferon-​α/β in mouse macrophages (42). Detailed promoter analysis revealed that
multiple distal and proximal cis-elements were involved in Egr-1 induction (43).

The generation of an inflammatory response is a complex process involving multiple cytokines acting
in parallel and in concert in innate and adaptive immunity (36,44). ​Influenza virus-infected dendritic
cells and macrophages, which reside in close proximity to lung epithelium, can produce significant
amounts of TNF–​α and type I IFN in response to virus infection (45). ​IFN-​α​/​β is involved in
signaling cross-talk with TNF​−α that enhance or dampen the severity of inflammatory response
(9,10). ​Interaction between Interferon–​α/β and TNF-​α signaling was reported in autoimmune
diseases. (12,13). A select list of genes was induced by both TNF-​α and Interferon- a​/β in PBMC
and BMDM gene expression datasets (Figure 6). TNF-​α induction of these genes was much higher
than IFN ​α/β in the mouse BMDM cells. Interestingly, Egr-1 was induced by both cytokines in
PBMC and BMDM. These genes are involved in transcriptional regulation and integrating signal
transduction pathways that are likely to play an important role in the cytokine storm and shift to
hyperinflammatory gene expression in response to coronavirus infections (30,65).
3.3 Regulation of Egr-1 target genes in PBMC and BMDM by IFN-a/
​ β
Egr-1 is a zinc finger transcription factor that binds to a GC-rich sequence in the promoter regions of
target genes. A shortlist of Egr-1 regulated genes was generated from the TRUUST transcription
factor database and published studies in different cell types and under different stimuli (20-22,46).
Egr-1 regulates genes involved in cell growth (Egr2, Atf3, Pdgfrb, Cdkna1, Ccnd1, Tnfsf10, and
chemokines involved in inflammation such as (Cxcl10, Cxcl2, Ccl2, Ccl3). It is important to note that
many of the Egr-1 target genes were also known targets of NF-KB, AP1, and Stat1 in cytokine
signaling (46). Furthermore, Egr-1 interacts with several other transcription factors such as Ets1, Ets2,
Elk1 that are common in cytokine responsive genes (46). Previous studies have shown that
transcription factors of innate and adaptive immunity show functional connectivity involving shared

interacting protein partners and target genes. (47). Cluster analysis revealed that Egr-1 induction was
correlated with the expression of Egr-1 target genes by IFN-​α/β in PBMC and in BMDM cells
(Figure 7).
3.4

Regulation of Egr-1 By Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses (SARS-CoV)

and other Respiratory Viruses
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) and influenza viruses are major
respiratory pathogens in humans with seasonal epidemics and potential pandemic threats (48,49).
Respiratory virus infection results in lung injury, a significant component of which was mediated by
the host immune response (50). The highly pathogenic 1918 Influenza virus-induced gene expression
signature in mouse lungs characterized by enhanced expression of cytokines such as TNF-​α​, IFN-​γ,
and IL-6 resulting in a dramatic increase in chemokines and inflammatory cell influx consisting of
neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes (51,52). Gene expression profiling in the lungs of mice
infected with 1918 influenza HINI showed enhanced expression of Egr-1 and its downstream target
genes Cxcl2 and Ccl2 involved in neutrophil and macrophage inflammatory influx, respectively (51).
Activation of multiple signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of transcription factors
such as AP1 and NF-kB in response to influenza infection were reported (53,54). Influenza virus
propagation was impaired by inhibition of the Mek/Erk pathway and lung-specific expression of
active Raf kinase results in increased mortality of influenza virus- infected mice (55,56). ​Enhanced
cytokine and chemokine expression were also reported in longitudinal studies of severe COVID -19
patients (57).
Gene expression profiling studies of human lung epithelial cell lines such as Calu-3, A549, and
NHBE1 in response to

respiratory viruses were reported recently (30,31).

Interrogation of

Microarray data sets revealed that Egr-1 was induced by SARS-CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2 infection but
not by mock-infection in Calu-3 cells. This induction was observed at 24 hours after infection . Egr-1
regulated gene TNFSF10 (TRAIL) was also induced by SARS-CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2 infection
(Figure 8). TRAIL is a widely expressed member of the TNF family involved in critical biological
functions including apoptosis and tumor suppressor activities (58). TRAIL activation was
demonstrated to be part of the effector mechanisms by which influenza-specific T cells protect the
host against virus infection (54,59). Furthermore, Egr-1 target genes including transcription factors
(ATF3) and chemokines (CXCL10) were also induced by SARS-CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2 infection
of Calu-3 cells (Figure 9).

In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection of A549 failed to induce Egr-1

expression (data not shown). Recent studies have shown that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) functions as ectopeptidase and virus entry receptor and facilitates entry of SARS-CoV1 and
SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelial cells (60). Expression of ACE2 in A549 cells rescued SARS-CoV-2
-mediated Egr-1 induction and the expression of Egr-1 target genes such as ATF3 (Figure 10).
Furthermore, expression of CXCL10, CXCL2, CCL3, CCL4 chemokines were dramatically increased
after SARS-CoV-2 infection of A549 cells expressing ACE2 (Figure 11 and data not shown).
Importantly, the expression of ACE2 alone in A549 cells did not induce Egr-1 mRNA levels.
Differential regulation of SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 and A549 suggest that these cell lines may differ in
the expression levels of host factor (ACE2) required for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Pandemic 1918 H1N1
influenza virus infection induced expression of Egr-1 and Egr-1 dependent chemokines in mouse
lungs (Figure 12A). In contrast, influenza A virus (IAV) suppressed Egr-1 expression in NHBE
bronchial epithelial cells that is dependent on viral non-structural protein or NS1 (Figure 12B). These
studies suggest that multiple factors such as influenza strain, virus- encoded factors (NS1), cell type

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or parainfluenza virus (HPIV3)

infection also induced Egr-1 mRNA in A549 cells, 24 hours post-infection (Figure 12C). These
studies suggest that Egr-1 expression is a common host response to many respiratory viruses
3.5 Regulation of Egr-1 in COVID-19 patient lung biopsies and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear
Cells
Gene expression profiling studies of a limited number of human lung biopsies and PBMC of healthy
controls and COVID-19 patients were reported recently (30,31). Interrogation of the gene expression
data in lung biopsies revealed that Egr-1 expression levels were significantly lower in COVID-19
patients compared with healthy controls. Expression of Egr-1 target genes related to cell growth such
as CCND1, EGR2, and PDGFRB were also down-regulated (Figure 13 and data not shown). In
contrast, expression of Egr-1 target genes involved in inflammatory responses such as CXCL10,
CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, and TNFSF10 were dramatically enhanced in COVID-19 patients compared
with healthy controls (Figure 14 and data not shown). Interestingly, STAT1 expression levels were
significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls (Figure 14). There are
several limiting factors to interpreting the data. The lung is a complex tissue consisting of more than
thirty cell types with differential contributions with respect to cell mass and gene expression. For
example, type I and type II cells in mouse lungs constitute the major and minor cell types and express
distinct cell markers (35). Without information on the expression levels in distinct cell types, it is
difficult to correlate Egr-1 expression with target genes in the whole lung tissue. In support of this
view, in a mouse model of CD8​+ T cell -mediated lung injury, chemokine expression was dependent
on Egr-1 activation in alveolar type II cells (63). Another intriguing possibility is that enhanced
STAT1 expression compensates for decreased Egr-1 expression in some cell types in the lung. It is

important to consider that in addition to changes in mRNA levels, the phosphorylation status of
STAT1 and Egr-1 may play an important role in the transcriptional regulation of chemokine target
genes. It is likely that differential expression in distinct cell types may account for the disparity of
Egr-1 and its target gene expression in healthy controls and COVID-19 patients. Longitudinal studies
in COVID-19 patients revealed that cytokines and chemokines were dramatically elevated in the lungs
and correlated with the severity of the disease (57). Egr-1 mRNA levels were elevated and correlated
with TNFSF10/TRAIL expression in the adult but not developing neutrophils of the peripheral blood
mononuclear cells of COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls (Figure 15). These results
suggest the possibility of differential growth, survival, and apoptosis of mature versus developing
neutrophils. Preliminary gene expression data in the lungs and PBMC of healthy and COVID-19
patients were limited by the number of datasets and should be interpreted with caution and needs
further verification.

Conclusion

Egr-1 has emerged as a key regulator of cell growth, reproduction, and response to tissue injury (16,
61-63). Egr-1 was rapidly induced by interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-​α,
and IL-1​β (15,63,64). Recent studies have demonstrated dramatic changes in type I interferon,
TNF-​α, and IL-1​β production by immune cells and cytokine-mediated lung inflammation in
COVID-19 patients (30,57,65,66). However, the role of Egr-1 in innate immunity and antiviral
response to respiratory viruses in general and SARS-CoV-2, in particular, remains to be investigated.
Transcriptional factor profiling in the transcriptome revealed that Egr-1was induced by IFN- ​α/β​,
TLR ligands, and TNF-​α in human and mouse cells. Studies in mutant cell lines lacking Stat1, Stat2,
and Irf9 revealed that IFN-​α/β induction of Egr-1 was independent of ISGF-3 components and

mediated by the activation of Erk-1/2 pathway. Furthermore, respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2
induced Egr-1 and its target genes in several lung epithelial cell lines and in COVID-19 patients.
Activation of Egr-1 by IFN-​α/β and TNF-​α and cross-talk between the pathways modulates signal
transduction and inflammatory response in innate immunity.
