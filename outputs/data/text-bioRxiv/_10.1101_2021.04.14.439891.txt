Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has necessitated the rapid development of prophylactic vaccines.
Two mRNA vaccines have been approved for emergency use by the FDA and have
demonstrated extraordinary effectiveness. The success of these mRNA vaccines establishes
the speed of development and therapeutic potential of mRNA. These authorized vaccines
encode full-length versions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. They are formulated with Lipid
Nanoparticle (LNP) delivery vehicles that have inherent immunostimulatory properties.
Different vaccination strategies and alternative mRNA delivery vehicles would be desirable to
ensure flexibility of future generations of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the development of mRNA
vaccines in general. Here, we report on the development of an alternative mRNA vaccine
approach using a novel delivery vehicle called Charge-Altering Releasable Transporters
(CARTs). Using these inherently nonimmunogenic vehicles we are able to tailor the vaccine
immunogenicity by inclusion of co-formulated adjuvants such as oligonucleotides with CpG
motifs. Mice vaccinated with our mRNA-CART vaccine developed therapeutically relevant
levels of RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies in both the circulation and in the lung bronchial
fluids. In addition, our vaccine elicited strong and long lasting RBD-specific TH1 T cell responses
including CD4+ and CD8+ T cell memory.
Introduction
Coronavirus pandemics have been a growing concern for more than a decade and several
attempts have been made to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-1 and the Middle Eastern
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).1 The global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus stimulated
worldwide efforts to leverage previous insights from coronavirus vaccines to develop safe,
effective and scalable vaccines to alleviate the COVID-19 pandemic. While a variety of vaccine
candidates and approaches are being investigated worldwide,2 the extraordinary pace of
development and implementation of mRNA vaccines3–6 illustrates the potential of this
emerging technology. The mRNA vaccines granted emergency use authorization by the FDA
against SARS-Cov-2 represents a triumph of basic and applied science as these advances
enabled the most rapid clinical translation from concept to clinical trial ever for a vaccine.5,6

natural degradation mechanisms in the body. mRNA vaccines offer flexible and fast design,
that will allow for subsequent generations of products to address the emergence of new virus
variants.
The currently approved mRNA vaccines5,6 generated by in vitro transcription use chemicallymodified nucleotides incorporated in mRNAs encoding the full viral spike protein, usually
containing 2 structural epitope mutations, formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and are
administered intramuscularly. Despite their extraordinary success, the underlying science
that contributes to the most effective, safe and scalable vaccine against COVID-19 continues
to evolve. Modifications and sequence optimization of the mRNA and the particular
components of the delivery vehicle can influence the immunological response.7 Previous
studies of SARS-CoV and MERS have shown that the proper choice of encoded antigen is
critical8 to avoid potential complications from antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of
disease.9 The chemistry of the delivery vehicle is also important as the ionizable lipids that
are a component of LNPs act as adjuvants but can induce adverse events10 and the use of
polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the LNP formulations can contribute to allergic reactions.11,12
These continuing challenges and the degree to which the global scale of the COVID-19
pandemic has strained supply chains for the existing LNP technologies highlight the need to
develop alternative approaches, both to enhance the resilience of the global response in the
face of this and future pandemics, as well as to test alternative approaches that might lead to
the most effective and durable immunological responses as well as to be able respond rapidly
to emerging new virus variants13.
In this study we present an alternative 3-component mRNA vaccine utilizing mRNA encoding
the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein formulated with a highly
efficient, non-toxic, PEG-free mRNA delivery platform called Charge-Altering Releasable
Transporters (CARTs)14–16 and a TLR9 agonist (CpG) as co-formulated adjuvant16,17 (Fig. 1A).
Prior studies had indicated that the RBD is a promising antigen target18–20 as antibodies
elicited against this target are often strongly neutralizing. CARTs offer a promising new gene
delivery platform and have proven to be effective deliverers of mRNA vaccines in preclinical
mouse studies.16,21 CARTs are single component amphiphilic diblock oligomers containing a
sequence of lipid monomers and a sequence of cationic monomers (Fig. 1B, supplemental Fig.
1). They are readily produced on scale in a two-step organocatalytic oligomerization. CARTs
electrostatically encapsulate mRNA (or other co-formulated nucleotides like CpG) and deliver
the genetic cargo into cells. A unique feature of CARTs is their ability to undergo a chargealtering rearrangement to produce neutral diketopiperazine small molecules (DKPs). This
transformation facilitates the release of mRNA (Fig. 1C) and eliminates any toxic issues
associated with persistent cations.22 Previous observations had shown that upon I.V.
injection, CARTs containing hydroxyethyl glycine repeating cation units selectively deliver
mRNA to the spleen,14–16 whereas intramuscular (IM) injections of these same products result
in mRNA translation locally in the muscle (Fig. 1D). Moreover, CARTs containing unsaturated
lipid blocks exhibit enhanced transfection of antigen presenting cells15 motivating our choice
of such a CART for the COVID-19 vaccine. The CART delivery vehicle does not induce
nonspecific immune stimulation by itself.16,21 This property allows the co-formulation of
appropriate adjuvants to tune the induced immune response.

Here we show that co-formulation of a CART with mRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with
the TLR9 agonist CpG (RBD mRNA + CpG-CART) induces robust neutralizing antibodies and
RBD-specific T cell responses in mice. Moreover, we detect significant levels of these
antibodies and memory T cells in the spleen and lung of vaccinated animals.

Results
RBD mRNA + CpG-CART vaccination elicits anti-RBD specific antibodies at day 4 after
immunization
An mRNA encoding the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD)23 of SARS-CoV-2 was made in-house
based on the published sequence of the virus and included a 6x histidine (His) tag. The
resulting mRNA contained the optimal CAP-1 structure, uridines were replaced with modified
N1-methyl-pseudouridine and cytidines were replaced with 5-methylcytidine in order to
maximize mRNA stability and translation. Protein expression was verified by Western Blot in
transfected 293F and Hela cells (Supplemental Fig. 2A). To demonstrate that administration
of mRNA-CART complexes does not lead to nonspecific immune stimulatory effects when
formulated with optimally modified mRNA24, mice were injected intravenously (IV) with
mRNA-CART and monitored for the activation of innate immune cells, a test that we have
found to be most sensitive. Our mRNA CART complexes were free of such nonspecific
stimulatory effects when formulated with modified mRNA. However, when formulated with
unmodified mRNA, nonspecific activation of innate immune cell subsets could be observed,
demonstrating that the property of nonspecific immune stimulation is dependent on the
cargo and not the CARTs (Supp. Fig. 2B). We were then able to direct the immune response
of our candidate vaccine by co-formulating the mRNA-CART complexes with CpG
oligonucleotides that trigger endosomal TLR9 receptors in antigen presenting cells. These CpG
entities are known to be safe and effective vaccine adjuvants.17
We assessed the effects of the RBD mRNA-CART vaccination with or without the addition of
CpG as adjuvant. IV injection of CARTs effectively delivers the cargo to antigen presenting cells
(APCs) such as B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells in the spleen15,16 (Fig. 1D). This route
of administration of mRNA-CART vaccination had proven effective in previous studies of
therapeutic cancer vaccination.16 Based on this knowledge, we evaluated our vaccine first by
IV administration. Mice were primed on day 0 and received two boosts on day 4 and on day
8 with 3ug RBD mRNA-CART formulated with or without 3ug of CpG (Fig. 2A). As control a
group that received 3ug CpG-CART alone with no mRNA and a control group treated with
Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) were included. Mice vaccinated with RBD mRNA-CART plus
CpG developed detectable levels of anti-RBD IgG and IgM as early as 4 days after vaccination
(supplementary Fig. 3A). Over time, we observed an increase in the levels of anti-RBD
antibodies in the serum of both mRNA-treated groups compared to controls (Fig. 2B).
Importantly, the antibodies induced by our vaccine were specific for RBD and did not cross
react to an irrelevant His-tagged protein (GFP-His) (supplementary Fig. 3B). Notably, RBDspecific antibody responses in mice vaccinated with the formulation including CpG
consistently exceeded those observed in groups treated without CpG (Fig. 2B).

Figure 2) Addition of CpG to RBD mRNA-CART elicits a stronger anti-RBD immunoglobulin response and leads
to earlier isotype switching
BALB/c mice were immunized intravenously with either 3ug RBD mRNA-CART (n=5), 3ug RBD mRNA-CART plus
3ug CpG (n=5), 3µg CpG CART (n=5) or Naïve untreated (n=5) and boosted on Day 4 and Day 8 after priming (A).
Serum levels of RBD-specific IgGs from RBD mRNA-CART (Black), RBD mRNA + CpG-CART (Blue), CpG CART
(Orange), and Naïve (Red) mice were monitored over the course of 60 days post priming by ELISA (B). On Day 14
and Day 60 after priming the distribution of IgG isotypes specific to RBD was analyzed using anti-mouse IgG1
(Blue), IgG2a (Black), IgG2b (red) and IgG3 (grey) monoclonal antibodies by ELISA (C). Data representative of 2
individual experiments.

Addition of CpG results in early isotype switching of RBD-specific antibody responses
By day 14, we observed that the CpG co-formulated vaccine induced an RBD-specific Ig
response that had undergone isotype switching from IgG1 to IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3. By
contrast, mice receiving the vaccine formulation without co-formulated CpG produced
predominantly unswitched IgG1 (Fig. 2C and supplementary Fig. 4A, B). By day 60, these
differences were less apparent, however we detected higher levels of all classes of RBD
specific antibodies in serum of mice vaccinated with the CpG-containing vaccine (Fig. 2C and
supplementary Fig. 4 B).

Antibodies induced by the RBD mRNA + CpG-CART vaccine inhibit RBD-ACE2 binding and
neutralize pseudotyped viral entry
The induced anti-sera were next tested for their ability to inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction
(Fig. 3A) and to block pseudotyped viral entry into ACE2 expressing target cells (Fig. 3B).
Functional RBD-ACE2 receptor blocking was assayed both against the binding of RBD protein
to the ACE2 expressing target cell by flow cytometry (data not shown) and by binding to solid
phase coated with ACE2 protein. On day 28, we observed a striking difference in the level of
neutralizing antibodies between the group that had received the vaccine containing the CpG
as compared to the group vaccinated without the adjuvant. While anti-sera from the RBD
mRNA + CpG-CART group displayed a high degree of receptor blocking and pseudotyped viral
neutralization with IC50 of 1:500 and 1:18000 respectively, the anti-sera from mice
vaccinated with RBD mRNA-CART was only barely positive above background (Fig. 3A, B).
However, by day 60 antisera from mice vaccinated with RBD mRNA-CART were able to block
RBD-ACE2 receptor binding and neutralize pseudotyped viral entry, although to a lesser
extent than antisera from mice vaccinated with RBD mRNA + CpG-CART (Fig. 3A, B). The
results from the receptor interaction blocking assay and the pseudovirus neutralization assay
were well correlated.

Figure 3 RBD mRNA + CpG-CART generates early high levels of RBD neutralizing antibodies
BALB/c mice (n=5) were immunized as described in Fig 2A. Sera from mice immunized with RBD mRNA-CART
(Black), RBD mRNA + CpG-CART (Blue), CpG CART (Orange) were collected on D28 and D60 and tested in a
commercially available RBD-ACE-2 inhibition assay (A). The same set of serum samples was tested in a pseudo
typed virus neutralization assay. RBD expressing pseudo virus particles containing a zsGreen and Firefly
Luciferase vectors were co-incubated with titrated concentrations of heat inactivated mouse serum. The pseudo
virus particle-serum mix was then added to wells containing ACE-2 overexpressing 293F cells. Firefly luciferase
expression was measured at 48h and 72h post experiment start (B). On D60 BAL was harvested from RBD mRNACART (Black), RBD mRNA + CpG-CART (Blue) and CpG-CART (Orange) immunized mice. RBD-specific total IgG was
assayed by ELISA (C). BAL containing immunoglobulins were tested for their ability to inhibit binding of RBD to
hACE-2 using a commercial ACE-2 inhibition kit (D). Lung single cell suspensions from naive mice (grey, n=3) or
mice vaccinated on D0 and D21 IV with 3µg RBD-mRNA + 3µg CpG (blue, n=3) were collected on D28 and
incubated with media alone, RBD protein or an irrelevant protein (CD81-His) [5µg/ml] for 48h and stained for T
cell activation markers CD134, CD137 and intracellular TNFa on CD4+ T cells (E). Data are shown as mean ± SD.

Neutralizing RBD-specific antibodies in bronchoalveolar lavage of vaccinated mice
To evaluate the presence of RBD-specific Igs in the lungs of vaccinated mice, we collected
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on day 60 after treatment. RBD-specific Ig was detected in BAL
from both the RBD mRNA + CpG-CART and the RBD mRNA-CART groups by ELISA (Fig. 3C).
Notably, as BAL is collected by flushing lungs with 2ml sterile PBS, the Ig titers represent highly
diluted samples. Importantly, although diluted, these immunoglobulins from BAL of both
vaccinated groups blocked RBD-ACE2 binding on D60 (Fig. 3D).
RBD specific CD4+ T cells in the lung of vaccinated mice
In mice, Ig class switching is linked to TH1 T cell responses.25,26 To evaluate the vaccine induced
T cell responses we prepared single cell suspensions from the lungs of IV vaccinated mice on
D28 and cultured the cells for 48 hours in media alone, in the presence of soluble RBD-His
protein or a control protein CD81-His. Cells were then collected and assayed by flow
cytometry for T cell activation using fluorochrome conjugated monoclonal antibodies for
memory and activation-specific surface proteins and intracellular cytokines. Remarkably,
upon RBD protein restimulation, a defined RBD-specific CD4+/CD44high/CD134+ and
CD4+/CD44high/TNFa+ activated T cell subset could be identified in lung cell suspensions from
mice vaccinated with RBD mRNA + CpG-CART that could not be detected when cells were
cultured with media alone or in the presence of the control protein hCD81-His (Fig. 3E). TNF𝛼
secretion by CD4+ T cells is associated with a TH1 polarization.
RBD mRNA + CpG-CART vaccine elicits robust anti-RBD Ig responses by intravenous,
intramuscular and subcutaneous route of administration
To test the efficacy of our vaccine in relation to the route of administration (ROA), we
compared RBD-specific Ig responses induced by immunizations given IV, IM, or SC. Mice were
primed with 3ug RBD mRNA and 3ug CpG formulated in CARTs on day 0 and received a boost
on day 8 (supplementary Fig. 5A). While all routes of administration led to detectable
neutralizing antibody titers, IV immunizations consistently gave a superior response at the
analyzed timepoints D14 and D28, with no significant differences between IM and SC
administration (supplementary Fig. 5B). Isotype switching occurred in all routes of
administration (supplementary Fig. 5C).

RBD mRNA + CpG-CART vaccine induces robust RBD-specific Ig responses in a clinically
relevant prime-boost regimen and is independent of CpG source
Guided by the immunization regimen chosen by the currently approved SARS-CoV-2
vaccines27, mice were primed with the vaccine on day 0 and boosted on day 21. Mice were
immunized either IV or IM with 3ug RBD mRNA + CpG-CART (Fig. 4A). Confirming previous
observations, although robust responses were observed for both groups, IV immunized mice
showed higher titers of anti-RBD antibodies in serum and in the BAL on both D21 and D28
(Fig. 4B-D). Anti-sera from both groups effectively inhibited RBD-ACE2 binding on D21
(supplementary Fig. 6B), although substantially more effective on D28 reflecting the
difference observed in total RBD-specific IgGs between the two groups (Fig. 4C). Moreover,
robust antibody responses against the complete spike protein were observed in both groups,
although higher in the intravenous group (supplementary Fig. 6C). Thus, the vaccine induced
anti-RBD response is primarily directed towards exposed RBD epitopes in the complete spike
protein. Importantly, although CpG is required for robust isotype switched anti-RBD
immunoglobulin, the response is independent of the source of CpG. We tested 4 different
sources of CpG, three of the C-subclass of CpGs (CpG-C) and one to the B-subclass (CpG-B).
No significant difference was observed between the different CpG-Cs (Supplementary Fig. 6
and 7), while the B-subclass CpG underperformed compared to the CpG-Cs (data not shown).

Figure 4) RBD mRNA + CpG-CART elicits neutralizing anti-RBD immunoglobulin responses after IV and IM
vaccination
BALB/c mice (n= 5 per group) were immunized intravenously (IV) or intramuscular (IM) with 3ug RBD mRNA plus
3ug CpG and boosted on Day 21 after priming (A). RBD-specific immunoglobulin titers in serum were measured
and quantified on Day 21 and Day 28 (B, C). On Day 28 BAL was harvested from both IV and IM treated mice and
anti-RBD immunoglobulins were assayed by ELISA (D). Data are shown as mean ± SD. Data representative of 2
independent experiments.

RBD mRNA + CpG-CART vaccine induced long lasting TH1 CD4+ and CD8+ T cell memory
Splenocytes from mice that had received 3µg RBD-mRNA + 3µg CpG-CART vaccination either
IV or IM or 3µg ctrl mRNA + 3µg CpG-CART either IV or IM on D1 and D21 were harvested on
day 105 after vaccination and characterized for T cell responses by IFNγ enzyme-linked
immunosorbent spot assay (ELISpot). In this assay, pooled splenocytes were enriched for
either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells and cultured overnight with a SARS-CoV-2 RBD peptide pool, media
alone or with media supplemented with anti-mouse CD3/28. Significant IFNγ responses in
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected by both IV and IM vaccination. Since the route of
administration of IV vaccinated mice targets the spleen, it is expected that spleen T cells
would give a stronger response. On the other hand, it is remarkable to detect responding T
cells 105 days after vaccination (Fig. 5 A, B).
To further assess the functionality and polarization of the vaccine induced T cells we
incubated Splenocytes of individual mice from the same experiment in the presence of a RBD
peptide pool or media alone. After 18 hours of incubation, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were assayed
separately by flow cytometry for their expression of memory markers CD44 and for the
intracellular cytokines IFNγ, TNFα and IL-4. Even at this late time point after vaccination a
significant population of RBD-specific IFNγ producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and TNFα
producing CD8+ T cells could be identified in the RBD-mRNA + CpG-CART IV vaccinated group.
There was no increase in IL-4 producing CD4+ T cells, indicating that T cell memory was
predominately TH1 (Fig. 5 C, D, supplemental Fig. 8). In contrast to the IFNγ ELISpot results we
were not able to identify these low frequency populations (mean 28 and 55 IFNγ spots per
5x105 cells for CD4+ and CD8+ enriched conditions respectively) in the IM vaccinated mice by
flow cytometry.

Figure 5) RBD mRNA plus CpG vaccination induces long lasting memory TH1 CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses
BALB/c mice (n= 5 per group) were immunized intravenously (IV) or intramuscular (IM) with 3µg ctrl mRNA + 3µg
CpG or 3µg RBD mRNA + 3µg CpG on D1 and boosted on D21 after priming. On day 105 pooled splenocytes were
harvested, enriched for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and stimulated separately for 16h with a RBD peptide mix for direct
ex vivo IFN𝛾 ELISpot assay (A, B). For ELISpot analysis splenocytes from the respective groups were measured in
triplicates. Additionally, whole splenocytes of individual mice (n=5 per group) were incubated with media or a
RBD peptide pool for 18h. After incubation cells were collected and stained for T cell memory marker CD44 as
well as intracellular cytokines IFNg, TNFa and IL-4 (C, D). Each dot represents the measurement of an individual

Neutralizing antibody levels of immunized mice are comparable to those achieved in

Results from clinical trials indicate that the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine and the Moderna
vaccine both conferred protection from symptomatic infection prior to administration of their
second booster vaccine doses.28,29 This implies that the antibody levels in humans at that early
pre-boost time point are sufficient to confer disease protection. Accordingly, we compared
the levels of neutralizing antibodies achieved in our vaccinated mice to those in immunized
humans both prior to and after their boosters. BALB/c mice were vaccinated with 3µ RBD

mice sera were then compared to sera from 13 individual vaccinated humans collected 15-21
days after their priming vaccination and then again 15+/-4 days after their booster
vaccinations. The level of RBD-ACE2 inhibition achieved with post boost sera from our IM and
IV vaccinated mice was similar to or higher than that of the human pre-boost sera. The
inhibitory antibody levels in the mice receiving the IV vaccination equaled those in humans
post boosting (Fig. 6A, B).

Discussion
For the first time mRNA-based therapeutics have been approved by the FDA and the success
of both mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is both remarkable and mutually validating.
However, challenges in production, deployment and availability of SARS-CoV2 vaccines
remain. One important aspect for the continuous success and refinement of mRNA-based
therapeutics in general, will be to create access to diverse choices of safe delivery vehicles
with varying chemical and biological properties. Here we demonstrate an effective mRNA
vaccination strategy against the clinically relevant RBD antigen of SARS-CoV-2 using an
alternative mRNA delivery platform to the clinically used lipid nanoparticles. We observed an
effective SARS-CoV-2 specific immune response that was enhanced by the inclusion of the
TLR9 agonist CpG as adjuvant. We further showed that the resulting anti-RBD sera were able

to neutralize pseudoviral entry into ACE2-expressing cells. Focusing on the ACE2 receptor
binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus we were able to generate high amounts of isotype
switched RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies in both serum and lungs of immunized animals.
The levels of neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice were similar (IM) or higher (IV) than
the levels of neutralizing antibodies measured in pre-boost blood samples from humans
vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine. Since it has been shown that this
approved mRNA vaccine confers protection by day 12 post prime, this is an indication that
our vaccine induced neutralizing antibody levels sufficient to confer protection.28 Finally, the
RBD mRNA + CpG-CART vaccine induced RBD-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses with
induction of long-lasting T cell memory of TH1 polarization. In addition, the IgG isotype profile
dominated by IgG2a and IgG2b confirms a TH1 polarized T cell response.
When compared to LNPs, CARTs have unique biodistribution, selectively delivering mRNA to
the spleen or other organs without the need for targeting ligands, simply through changes in
the CART structure. CARTs can be readily prepared and be formulated with multiple mRNAs
in any desired nucleotide combination21, only require a single structural component that is
mixed with mRNA, and do not require specialized microfluidics instruments for their
manufacture. In contrast to LNPs, CARTs have no unspecific immunostimulatory effects,
which allows more flexibility for vaccine design and the option to choose the appropriate
adjuvant to co-deliver with mRNA, rather than relying on the inherent immunogenicity
properties of LNPs. When CARTs are injected IM, gene expression localizes exclusively at the
site of injection and does not spread to other organs. In a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine study using I.M.
injection of LNPs, the liver showed the highest level of reporter gene and antigen
expression.19 In addition, IV injection of CARTs confer mRNA expression exclusively to the
spleen which could explain the higher potency of IV compared to the IM routes. While IV
administration of the vaccine induced a stronger antibody and T cell response, significant
responses could be induced via both routes of administration. Interestingly, it has been shown
recently that IV vaccination with a BCG vaccine against tuberculosis profoundly altered the
protective outcome in non-human primates with an increase of antigen responsive CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells in blood, spleen, BAL and lung lymph nodes when compared to the established
intradermal or aerosol administration.30 Additionally, IV administered mRNA lipid
nanoparticles have demonstrated potency in preclinical mouse models of therapeutic cancer
vaccination.31
We chose to direct our vaccine specifically against the RBD rather than the whole spike
protein sequence. Potent humoral and cellular immune responses have been observed in
clinical trials with both the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein and RBD.6 Moreover, an RBD
mRNA directed vaccine was proven safe in a phase 1/2 clinical trial tested in the US and in
Germany.27,32 In addition, the RBD provides essential targetability for humoral and cellular
immune responses. Piccoli et al. showed that 90% of the neutralizing activity of serum from
exposed patient target the RBD.33 RBD is also an epitope for T cell responses against SARSCoV-2 S protein.34 A fast-spreading mutant with a mutation in the RBD (N501Y) has been
identified in the UK (B.1.1.7) raising concerns about coverage of the current mRNA-based
vaccines.6 This N501Y mutation does not seem to affect the efficacy of an RBD vaccination
since mice vaccinated against the original RBD sequence were able to clear a SARS-CoV-2
variant containing the specific mutation.35 However recent data indicates that other clinically
relevant RBD and non-RBD mutations can mediate escape from vaccine induced humoral

immunity13,36, highlighting the urgent need of flexible and rapidly adaptable vaccine
platforms.
We believe that the ability to formulate TLR activating molecules like CpG into our vaccine
will aid in inducing a protective immune response in populations with less competent immune
systems and that are more at risk for severe COVID19 symptoms. Our three-component
vaccine incorporates a controlled addition of an adjuvant that directly stimulates APCs. CpG
directly activates pDCs and B cells, contributing to the induction of both innate and adaptive
immune responses. The cascade of events initiated by CpG indirectly supports the
maturation, differentiation and proliferation of natural killer cells, T cells and
monocytes/macrophages.37–40 B cells activated by CpG upregulate expression of their Fc
receptor (FcR) and costimulatory molecules including MHC class II, CD40, CD80 and CD86.41–
43
Subsequently, the CpG-stimulated B cells proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells and
memory B cells.44 The adjuvant effects of CpG are supported by our study where the addition
of CpG resulted in a more rapid immune response, higher anti-RBD titers in serum and
bronchoalveolar lavage, more effective ACE2-RBD inhibition and pseudo typed virus
neutralization, increased T cell response, and more pronounced isotype switching.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates the potency and flexibility of this mRNA-CART vaccine
platform against the clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen. The robust induction of both
B and T cell responses via different routes of administration warrants further exploration and
its use as an alternative to the clinically approved lipid nanoparticles in the general
development of mRNA-based therapeutics against infectious diseases.
Material and Methods
Recombinant Proteins
The pCAGGS plasmids coding for soluble RBD-His, residues 319-541, and spike-His, residues
1-1213 from the Wuhan-Hu-1 genome sequence (GenBank MN9089473) were a gift from
Prof. Florian Krammer (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai).23 The pcDNA3 plasmid
coding for a soluble ACE2-hIgA FC fusion protein was purchased from addgene (ID 145154).
Plasmids were expanded using One Shot™ TOP10 Chemically Competent E. coli (ThermoFisher
Scientific) and the ZymoPURE II Plasmid Maxiprep Kit (Zymo Research). Recombinant proteins
were produced using the Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by transfecting 200x106 of
these cells with purified DNA using the ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection Kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Supernatants from transfected cells were harvested 3 days post transfection by
centrifugation at 300g for 10 min and filtration through a 22um filter. RBD-His and Spike-his
containing supernatants were batch purified using the HisPur™ Ni-NTA Resin (ThermoFisher
Scientific). Supernatants were incubated with 6 ml of resin for 1h at RT. Then, the resin was
recovered by centrifugation (2 min at 700g), washed and finally eluted per manufacturer
recommendation. Elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blot to confirm
RBD-His or Spike-His purification and the positive fractions were pooled.
In vitro transcription
The RBD-6his was cloned from the pCAGGS expression plasmid into the LF-pLMCT plasmid
that contains a T7 promoter and a polyA sequence required for mRNA synthesis. The LFpLMCT plasmid was a gift from Dr. Kris Thielemans (Free University of Belgium). The RBD-6his

CART preparation and characterization
CART O6-stat-N6: A9, consisting of a first block of a 1:1 statistical mixture of oleyl and nonenylsubstituted carbonate monomers, followed by a block of a-amino ester monomer was
prepared as previously reported.14,15 Briefly, to a mixture of nonenyl (29 mg, 1 mmol), and
oleyl carbonate (40.5 mg, 1 mmol) in toluene (150 μL) was added TU, DBU, and BnOH (5 mol%
TU/DBU, 0.2 mmol BnOH) in 50 μL toluene. The reaction was stirred for 1.5 hours, then the
morpholinone monomer (33.4 mg, 0.16 mmol) was added as a solid then stirred for an
additional 2.5 hours. The reaction was quenched with AcOH then dialyzed overnight in
DCM/MeOH (3.5 kDa M.W, cut-off). Concentration after dialysis afforded 85 mg clear residue
which was deprotected with TFA (0.85 mL) in dry DCM (8.5 mL) overnight. Endgroup analysis
of the deprotected polymer showed block lengths of 6 nonenyl and 6 oleyl carbonate units
and 9 cationic aminoester units.
CART oligonucleotide formulation
To prepare the CART-vaccine, CARTs were formulated with a mixture of CpG and RBD mRNA
at a 10:1 cation: anion ratio assuming full protonation of the CART and full deprotonation of
the oligonucleotides (1:1 mass ratio of CpG and mRNA nucleotides). Formulations were
prepared by mixing the reagents for 20 seconds in acidic PBS (pH adjusted to 5.5 by addition
of 0.1M HCl) in a total volume of 50-100µl, followed by a brief spin in a tabletop centrifuge.
The formulation was used within 5 minutes for in vitro or in vivo experiments.
Mouse vaccination
Eight- to twelve-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory
and housed in the Laboratory Animal Facility of the Stanford University Medical Center. All
experiments were approved by the Stanford Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal
Care and were conducted in accordance with Stanford University Animal Facility and NIH
guidelines.RBD-mRNA and CpG were formulated with CART polymer in PBS at pH 5.5 as
described above. Mice were injected with 3µg RBD-mRNA formulated with 2.6µl CART
(5mM) or 3µg CpG formulated with 2.6µl CART (5mM) or 3µg RBD-mRNA plus 3µg CpG
formulated with 5.2µl of CART (5mM). Mice were vaccinated by IV, IM or SC injection and
were boosted as described in the experiment. CARTs are formulated at indicated
concentrations of mRNA in 50-100 µL total volume. For IV administration 100 µl formulated
CART was administered per tail vein injection. For IM injections 50 µl of formulated CART

was injected in the thigh muscle. SC injections were administered on the back of the mouse
near the tail. At indicated time points mice were bled and serum was collected.
Hela and 293F transfection
Hela cells and 293F cells were plated at 106 cells per well in a 12 well plate in Opti-MEM media
(ThermoFisher Scientific). 2 µg of the RBD-his mRNA or GFP mRNA (Trilink) was formulated in
6.6 µl of PBS pH 5.5 with 1.37 µl of 5mM CART and added to the cells. After 4 hours of
transfection, Opti-MEM media was replaced by RPMI media containing 10 % FCS and
Penicillin-Streptomycin 1000 U/ml. 12 hours post transfection RBD and GFP expression were
monitored by western blot and fluorescence microscopy, respectively.
Western blot
15ul of media from Hela or 293F transfected cells were mixed with 4x sample loading buffer
(Invitrogen) and were loaded on a 4-12% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen). Electrophoresis was
performed in an MES buffer at 200V for 35 min. Proteins were transferred to a cellulose
membrane using the iBLOT system (Invitrogen). The membrane was stained with Ponceau red
to verify protein transfer then the membrane was blocked for 1h in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was washed 3 times in TBST and incubated in TBST containing 5%
non-fat dry milk and 1:1000 mouse anti-His (Biolegend) overnight. After 3 washes in TBST the
membrane was incubated with 1:10000 anti-mouse Ig (Southern Biotech) in TBST containing
5% non-fat dry milk for 1 hour. After 3 washes in TBST the blot was revealed using the EC™
Prime Western Blotting System (Sigma). The membrane was imaged using a Chemidoc MP
imaging system from BioRad.
Serum preparation
For human samples, informed consent was obtained from the subjects prior to blood draw.
Blood was collected in Eppendorf tubes and allowed to coagulate for 60 min at room
temperature. After 10 min of centrifugation at 1000xg the supernatant was collected. Serum
was heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 min.
ELISA
Nunc-Immuno™ MicroWell™ 96 well ELISA plates (MilliporeSigm) were coated overnight with
50ul per well of 2ug/ml RBD-His or Spike-His protein in carbonate buffer pH9. After 3 washes
in ELISA wash buffer (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20), plates were blocked using 100ul of 5% nonfat
dry milk diluted in TBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 hour at room
temperature. Serum, BAL and antibody dilutions were prepared in TBST containing 1% nonfat
dry milk. The blocking solution was removed and 50 µl of each serial dilution was added to
the plate for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed three times and incubated
with HRP conjugated anti-human Ig (1:5000, BioSource), anti-mouse Ig (1:5000, Cell
Signaling), anti-mouse IgG2a (1:5000, Southern Biotech), anti-mouse IgG2b (1:5000, Southern
Biotech), anti-mouse IgG1 (1:5000, Southern Biotech), anti-mouse IgG3 (1:5000, Southern
Biotech), anti-mouse IgA (1:5000, Invitrogene), or anti-mouse IgM (1:5000, Southern Biotech).
Plates were washed three times and 100 µl of TMB ELISA Substrate (Abcam) were added to
each well. ELISA was allowed to develop for 10 min and then the reaction was stopped by
adding 50 µl of Stop Solution for TMB Substrates (ThermoFisher Scientific) to each well. In
some assays, a human anti-RBD (Invivogene) of known antibody concentration was used as

standard. Optical density at 450nm (OD450) was measured using a SpectraMax Paradigm
Microplate Reader (Molecular devices).
RBD-ACE2 interaction blocking assay ELISA
RBD-ACE2 interaction blocking assay was evaluated using three methods: a commercial kit
from Genescript and an in house developed ELISA and by flow cytometry.
For the commercial kit, we used the SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (sVNT)
Kit (Genescript) following the manufacturer’s instructions. In short samples and controls were
diluted at indicated ratios with Dilution buffer and pre-incubated with HRP-RBD in a 1:1 ratio
for 30min at 37°C. Samples were then added to the capture plate in wells pre-coated with
hACE2. After 15’ incubation at 37°C wells were washed four times with wash buffer. TMB
solution was added and incubated for 15’ at room temperature in the dark. After 15’ stop
solution was added to the wells and promptly analyzed. Optical density at 450nm (OD450)
was measured using a SpectraMax Paradigm Microplate Reader (Molecular devices).
For the in-house developed ELISA, Nunc-Immuno™ MicroWell™ 96 well ELISA plates
(Millipore) were coated overnight with 50 µl per well of 2ug/ml RBD-His or Spike-His protein
in carbonate buffer pH9. After 3 washes in ELISA wash buffer (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20), plates
were blocked using 100ul of 5% nonfat dry milk diluted in TBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween
20 (TBST) for 1 hour at room temperature. Serum, BAL and antibody dilutions were prepared
in TBST containing 1% nonfat dry milk. The blocking solution was removed and 50 µl of each
serial dilution was added to the plate for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed
three times and 50 µl of 2 times diluted ACE2-hIgA supernatant was added to each well for 1
hour. After 3 washes, plate was incubated with HRP conjugated anti-human IgA (1:1000,
Thermo Scientific) for 1hour in TBST with 1% non-fat dry milk. Plates were washed three times
and 100 µl of TMB ELISA Substrate (Abcam) were added to each well. ELISA was allowed to
develop for 10 min and then the reaction was stopped by adding 50 µl of Stop Solution for
TMB Substrates (ThermoFisher Scientific) to each well. In some assays human anti-RBD
(Invivogen) of known antibody concentration was used as standard. Optical density at 450nm
(OD450) was measured using a SpectraMax Paradigm Microplate Reader (Molecular devices).
For the flow cytometry assay, RBD-His 2ug/ml was incubated with sera for 1 hour. Then, the
4x105 ACE2 expressing HEK293T cells were added to the RBD-His/sera mix and incubated at
RT for 30 min. Cells were then washed 2 times in PBS containing 1% BSA. RBD was then
detected using an Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti-His antibody (clone J099B1, Biolegend).
Cells were analyzed on a flow cytometry (BD).
Pseudo-virus assay
Pseudo-typed lentivirus expressing the Sars-Cov-2 spike protein and the luciferase was
produced in HEK293T cells as previously described45,46. One day before transfection, 6 x 106
HEK293T cells were seeded in a 10-cm culture plate in RPMI containing 10% FCS, 2mM Lglutamine, streptomycin and penicillin. Using TransIT (Mirus), cells were then transfected
with 10 µg of the lentiviral packaging vector (pHAGE_Luc2_IRES_ZsGreen), the 3.4 µg of SARSCoV-2 spike, and lentiviral helper plasmids (2.2 µg of HDM-Hgpm2, 2.2 µg of HDM-Tat1b, and
2.2 µg of pRC-CMV_Rev1b). The spike vector contained the full-length wild-type spike
sequence from the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank NC_045512). These 5

Washington). 72 hours post transfection, virus-containing supernatant was harvested,
centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes, filtered on a 0.45 um filter, aliquoted and frozen at -80oC.
For viral neutralization assays, ACE2-expressing HEK293T46 cells were plated in poly-L-lysinecoated, white-walled clear-bottom 96-well plates at 12,500 cells/well 1 day prior to infection.
Mouse serum was centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 15 min, heat inactivated for 30 min at 56 °C
and diluted in D10 media (DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FCS). Virus was diluted in
D10 medium, supplemented with polybrene (5 µg/mL), and then added to serum dilutions.
The virus/serum mix was preincubated for 1 hour at 37oC before it was added to the cells and
incubated at 37 °C for ∼48 h. Cells were lysed by adding BriteLite assay readout solution
(Perkin Elmer) and luminescence values were measured with a SpectraMax Paradigm
Microplate Reader (Molecular devices). As positive control a neutralizing human anti-SARSCov-2 IgG1 antibody was used (Acro).
Bronchoalveolar lavage
Mice were sacrificed and lungs were inflated 2 times with 1 ml of PBS following a previously
described procedure47. Lavage fractions were pooled and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min.
Supernatant was collected and assayed for anti-RBD antibodies by ELISA.
T cell response assay lung
Mouse lungs were harvested at indicated days after vaccination. To prepare lung single cell
suspensions, lungs were cut into small pieces and incubated at 37°C in RPMI containing
Collagenase D (2mg/ml, Sigma) and DNAse (50ug/ml, Sigma) for 30min. Then, digestion mix
was diluted 5 times and the lung preparations were processed through a 70-um cell strainer.
Red blood cells present in the spleen or lung single cell suspensions were lysed using ACK
buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Single cell suspensions were kept on ice until further
processing for T cell response assay. Cells were cultured in 96-well plates (Corning, V-bottom)
at 1x106 cells/well and stimulated for 48 hours with 5 μg/mL of RBD-His or hCD81-His or media
alone (RPMI + 5% FCS) in the presence of anti-mouse CD28 antibody [0,5 µg/ml] (Southern
Biotech). As positive control cells were stimulated with anti-mouse CD3 [0,05 µg/ml]
(Southern Biotech). For intracellular staining, cells were treated with GolgiStop (BD
Biosciences) for 5 hours prior to staining. Following stimulation, cells were washed, stained
with Aqua Live/dead viability dye (Thermo Fisher) in PBS, washed two additional times and
stained with a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies and Fc block: CD16/32, CD4 BV605 RM4-5,
CD8 FITC 53-6.7, CD44 APC IM7, CD69 PE-Cy7 H1.2F3, CD134 BV786 OX-86, CD137 PE 1AH2,
CD45R/B220 Per-CP 5.5 RA3-6B2 (all BD Bioscience). Cells were fixed and permeabilized
according to manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences) and stained with aTNF𝛼 BV650 MP6XT22 (BD Bioscience). Cells were washed, fixed with 2% formaldehyde and acquired on a BD
LSR II and analyzed using Cytobank V7.3.0.
T cell response assay spleen
Mouse spleens were harvested on D105 after vaccination and single-cell suspensions were
prepared by processing them through a 70-μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences). Cells were then
incubated in FACS tubes at 6x105 cells per tube and stimulated for 18 hours with 2 µg/ml RBD
peptide mix (PepMix SARS-CoV-2 (S-RBD) Protein ID: P0DTC2 PM-WCPV-S-RBD-1, JPT) or
media alone. As positive control cells were stimulated with anti-mouse CD3 [0,05 µg/ml]
(Southern Biotech) and anti-mouse CD28 antibody [0,5 µg/ml] (Southern Biotech). GolgiStop

(BD Biosciences) was added for the last 10 hours of the assay. Following stimulation, cells
were washed, stained with Aqua Live/dead viability dye (Thermo Fisher) in PBS, washed two
additional times and stained with a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies and Fc block: CD16/32,
CD4 Ax700 RM4-5, CD8 APC-H7 53-6.7, CD44 APC IM7 (all BD Bioscience). Cells were fixed and
permeabilized according to manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences) and stained for
intracellular cytokines with IFN𝛾 PE-Cy7 XMG1.2, TNF𝛼 BV650 MP6-XT22 and IL-4 BV786
11B11 (BD Bioscience). Cells were washed, fixed with 2% formaldehyde and acquired on a
Cytek Aurora (Northern Lights) and analyzed using Cytobank V7.3.0.
IFN𝜸 ELISpot
The assay was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions (R&D systems, mouse
IFNγ Kit Cat # EL485). In short IFNγ ELISpot analysis was performed ex vivo (without further
in vitro culturing for expansion) using PBMCs depleted of CD4+ and enriched for CD8+ T cells
or depleted of CD8+ and enriched for CD4+ T cells by MACS sort (Miltenyi CD4+ or CD8+
microbeads following manufacturer instructions). Tests were performed in triplicates and
with a positive control (anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (0,05 µg/ml; Southern Biotech). PVDF
backed microplate plates pre-coated with IFNγ-specific antibodies (R&D systems, mouse IFNγ
Kit Cat # EL485) were washed with PBS and blocked with RPMI medium (Corning) containing
5% FCS for 20min at room temperature. Per well, 5 × 105 effector cells were stimulated for
16h with 2 µg/ml RBD peptide mix (PepMix SARS-CoV-2 (S-RBD) Protein ID: P0DTC2 PMWCPV-S-RBD-1, JPT). After stimulation wells were washed and incubated with a biotinylated
anti-IFNγ antibody (R&D systems, mouse IFNγ Kit Cat # EL485) overnight at 4°C. Next day
wells were washed and incubated with Streptavidin-AP (R&D systems, mouse IFNγ Kit Cat #
EL485) for 2h at RT. After washing wells were incubated with a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3ʹ-indolyl
phosphate (BCIP)/nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) substrate (R&D systems, mouse IFNγ Kit Cat #
EL485). Plates were scanned and analyzed using ImmunoSpot Microanalyzer.
In vivo bioluminescence imaging
For bioluminescence assessment, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane gas (2% isoflurane
in oxygen, 1 L/min) during injection and imaging procedures. Intraperitoneal injections of dLuciferin (Biosynth AG) were done at a dose of 150 mg/kg, providing a saturating substrate
concentration for Fluc enzyme (luciferin crosses the blood–brain barrier). Mice were imaged
in a light-tight chamber using an in vivo optical imaging system (AMI HT; Spectral Instruments
imaging) equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device camera. During image recording,
mice inhaled isoflurane delivered via a nose cone, and their body temperature was
maintained at 37°C in the dark box of the camera system. Bioluminescence images were
acquired between 10 and 20 minutes after luciferin administration. Mice usually recovered
from anesthesia within 2 minutes of imaging.
Safety statement
For all mouse experiments no unexpected or unusually high safety hazards were
encountered
