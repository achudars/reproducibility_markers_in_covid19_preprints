SUMMARY
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped virus
responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite recent advances in the structural elucidation
of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the complexes of the spike (S) proteins with the cellular receptor
ACE2 or neutralizing antibodies, detailed architecture of the intact virus remains to be
unveiled. Here we report the molecular assembly of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus using
cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA). Native structures of
the S proteins in both pre- and postfusion conformations were determined to average
resolutions of 8.7-11 Å. Compositions of the N-linked glycans from the native spikes were
analyzed by mass-spectrometry, which revealed highly similar overall processing states of the
native glycans to that of the recombinant glycoprotein glycans. The native conformation of the
ribonucleoproteins (RNP) and its higher-order assemblies were revealed. Overall, these
characterizations have revealed the architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in unprecedented
detail, and shed lights on how the virus packs its ~30 kb long single-segmented RNA in the
~80 nm diameter lumen.

INTRODUCTION
As of August 10th, 2020, a total of over 20 million cases of COVID-19 were reported and more
than 700 thousand lives were claimed globally (https://covid19.who.int). The causative
pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, is a novel β-coronavirus (Lu et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al.,
2020). SARS-CoV-2 encodes at least 29 proteins in its (+) RNA genome, four of which are
structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins
(Kim et al., 2020).
The ~600 kDa, trimeric S protein, one of the largest known class-I fusion proteins, is heavily
glycosylated with 66 N-linked glycans (Walls et al., 2020; Watanabe et al., 2020a; Wrapp et
al., 2020). Each S protomer comprises the S1 and S2 subunits, and a single transmembrane
(TM) anchor (Wrapp et al., 2020). The S protein binds to the cellular surface receptor
angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) through the receptor binding domain (RBD), an
essential step for membrane fusion (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020;
Wang et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). The activation of S requires cleavage
of S1/S2 by furin-like protease and undergoes the conformational change from prefusion to
postfusion (Belouzard et al., 2009; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Simmons et al., 2004; Simmons
et al., 2013; Song et al., 2018). Several prefusion conformations have been resolved for the S
protein, wherein the three RBDs display distinct orientations, “up” or “down” (Walls et al.,
2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). The receptor binding sites expose, only when the RBDs adopt an
‘up’ conformation. The “RBD down”, “one RBD up” and “two-RBD up” conformations have
been observed in recombinantly expressed S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (Henderson et al., 2020;
Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). Upon activation, S follows a classic pathway among
class-I fusion proteins (Rey and Lok, 2018): it undergoes dramatic structural rearrangements
involving shedding its S1 subunit and inserting the fusion peptide (FP) into the target cell
membrane (Cai et al., 2020). Following membrane fusion, S transforms to a needle-shaped
postfusion form, having three helixes entwining coaxially (Cai et al., 2020). Despite the efforts
in elucidating the SARS-CoV-2 virus host recognition and entry mechanism at near-atomic
resolution using recombinant proteins, high-resolution information regarding the in situ
structures and landscape of the authentic virus is in-demand.
Coronavirus has the largest genome among all RNA viruses. It is enigmatic how the N protein
oligomerizes, organizes, and packs the ~30 kb long single-stranded RNA in the viral lumen.
Early negative-staining electron microscopy of coronaviruses showed single-strand helical

RNPs with a diameter of ~15 nm (Caul and Eggleston, 1979). Cryo-ET of SARS-CoV revealed
that RNPs organized into lattices underneath the envelope at ~4-5 nm resolution (Neuman et
al., 2006). However, such ultrastructure was not observed in the Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV),
the prototypic β-coronavirus (Barcena et al., 2009). No molecular model exists so far for the
coronavirus RNP, and little is known about the architecture, assembly and RNA packaging of
the RNPs of other (+) RNA viruses.
To address these questions, we combined cryo-ET and STA for the imaging analysis of 2,294
intact virions propagated from an early viral strain (Yao et al., 2020). To our knowledge, this
is the largest cryo-ET data set of SARS-CoV-2 virus to date. Here we report the architecture
and assembly of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Molecular landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
SARS-CoV-2 virions (ID: ZJU_5) were collected on January 22nd, 2020, from a patient with
severe symptoms, and were propagated in Vero cells. The patient was infected during a
conference with attendees from Wuhan (Yao et al., 2020). For cryo-EM analysis, the viral
sample was fixed by paraformaldehyde, which has minor effects on protein structure at 7-20 Å
resolution (Li et al., 2016; Wan et al., 2017). Intact and unconcentrated virions were directly
visualized from the supernatant by cryo-EM, showing both ellipsoidal and spherical enveloped
particles (Figure S1A), consistent with the observation on virions concentrated by
ultracentrifugation through sucrose cushion (Figure 1B). We modelled 2,294 virions as
ellipsoids by meshing their lipid envelopes, measuring average diameters of 64.8±11.8 nm,
85.9±9.4 nm and 96.6±11.8 nm for the short, medium and long axis of the envelope
respectively. S proteins and RNPs (Figures 1A, S1B, S5A and Video S1) represented the most
distinctive features of the virus. A comprehensive analysis has been carried out on the data. In
total, 56,832 spikes were manually identified from the virions, approximately 97% of which
are in the prefusion conformation, 3% in the postfusion conformation (Method details). An
average of 26 prefusion S were found randomly distributed on each virion (Figures 1B-C). The
spike copy number per virion is comparable to HIV (Liu et al., 2008), but ~5 times less than
the Lassa virus (LASV) (Li et al., 2016) or ~10 times less than the Influenza virus (Harris et
al., 2006). 18,500 RNPs were manually identified in the viral lumen (Table S1), giving an

average of 26 RNPs per virion. However, since the viral lumen is tightly packed with RNPs
and electron opaque, the actual number of RNPs per virion was estimated to be 20-30% more,
i.e. 30-35 RNPs per virion. Regularly ordered RNP ultrastructures were occasionally observed
(Figure S5A), indicating the RNPs could form local assemblies.
Two conformations of the prefusion S, namely the RBD down and one RBD up conformations
from inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions were classified and reconstructed to 8.7 Å and 10.9 Å
resolution by STA, with local resolution reaching 7.8 Å (Figures S3A-S3C). The heptad repeat
1 (HR1) and central helix (CH) domains of the S2 subunits represent the best resolved domains
(Figure S3D). The proportion of RBD down conformation among all prefusion S was estimated
to be 54% per virion (Figure 1C). The membrane proximal stalk of S represented the poorest
resolved region with a local resolution of ~20 Å, showing no trace of the TM or membrane in
the structure (Figure 1D). When the tomogram slices were scrutinized, spike populations that
either stand perpendicular to or lean towards the envelope were observed (Video S1),
suggesting that the TM was averaged out in the map.
Refined orientations of the prefusion S showed they rotate around their stalks almost freely
outside the envelope, with the highest possibility of leaning 40° relative to the normal axis of
the envelope (Figures 1B and 1D). The rotational freedom of spikes is allowed by its low
population density, which is prominently distinct from other enveloped viruses possessing
class-I fusion proteins (Harris et al., 2006; Li et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2008). Interestingly, a
minor population of Y-shaped spikes pair having two heads and one combined stem were
observed (Figures S2A and S2C), which possibly represent spikes intertwined with their stems.
These observations suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 spikes possess unusual freedom on the viral
envelope. Such unique features may facilitate the virus in exploring the surrounding
environment and better engaging with the cellular receptor ACE2, allowing multiple spikes to
bind with one ACE2 or one spike with multiple ACE2 simultaneously. However, the sparsely
packed spikes on the viral envelope are also more vulnerable to neutralizing antibodies that
bind the otherwise less accessible domains (Chi et al., 2020) or glycan holes (Walls et al.,
2019). Our observations on the structures and landscape of the intact SARS-CoV-2 are
consistent with two other cryo-ET studies appeared at the same period (Turoňová, 2020; Ke et
al., 2020).
Native structures of S in the prefusion conformation.

The native structures of S in the RBD down and one RBD up conformations were similar to
the rigidly fitted recombinant protein structures (PDB: 6XR8 and 6VYB) (Cai et al., 2020;
Walls et al., 2020), except for the N terminus domain (NTD). Comparison between the rigidly
and flexibly fitted PDB: 6XR8 suggested that the NTD on the native spike structure shifted 9
Å (centroid distance) away from S2 (Figure S3E). The slight dilation and lower local resolution
(Figure S3A and S3B) of the NTD on the native spike against recombinant spike structures
was also observed on the other cryo-ET structures (Ke et al., 2020). It is known that NTD
exhibits certain mobility as a rigid body (Cai et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020;
Xiong et al., 2020). It is possible that through large date set and classification, the near-atomic
resolution cryo-EM reconstruction of the spike represents its metastable conformation, while
the cryo-ET reconstructions represent an average of various dynamic states of the NTD.
Ten N-linked glycans are visible on the RBD down and seven on the one RBD up
conformations, of which N61, N282, N801, N1098 and N1134 were best resolved.
Interestingly, densities for glycans N1158 and N1173/N1194 are visible on the stem of the
spike (Figures 2B and S4C). In general, the glycan densities observed on the native spike fit
well with the full-length recombinant structure (Cai et al., 2020), however they are bulkier than
observed in the TM truncated recombinant spikes (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020).
Similar observations were reported by two recent studies of the native spike structures
(Turoňová, 2020; Ke et al., 2020).
We further determined the native glycan identity by analyzing the virus sample using mass
spectrometry (MS). The viral particles, with or without PNGase F digestion, were resolved on
SDS-PAGE. After PNGase F treatment, the S1 and S2 subunits were reduced by ~30 kDa and
~20 kDa, respectively, in weight (Figure 2C). The bands corresponding to S1 and S2 before
PNGase F treatment were analyzed by MS to reveal the glycan compositions at each of the 22
glycosylation sites (Figures 2D and S4B). The overall processing states of the native glycans
are highly similar to that of the recombinant glycoprotein glycans (Figures S4A and S4B)
(Watanabe et al., 2020a), a feature shared with MERS and SARS-CoV (Walls et al., 2019).
Populations of under-processed oligomannose-type glycans are found at the same sites as seen
in the recombinant material, including at N234 where the glycan is suggested to have a
structural role (Casalino et al., 2020). However, as is observed at many sites on HIV (Cao et
al., 2018; Struwe et al., 2018), the virus exhibits somewhat lower levels of oligomannose-type
glycosylation compared to the recombinant, soluble mimetic. Overall, the presence of

substantial population of complex-type glycosylation suggests that the budding route of SARSCoV-2 into the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartments (ERGIC) is
not an impediment to glycan maturation and is consistent with both analysis of SARS-CoV
glycans (Ritchie et al., 2010) and the identification of neutralizing antibodies targeting the
fucose at the N343 glycan on SARS-CoV-2 (Pinto et al., 2020). Furthermore, the lower levels
of oligomannose-type glycans compared to HIV and LASV are also consistent with lower
glycan density (Watanabe et al., 2020b; Watanabe et al., 2018). Comparing the structures
between our native prefusion S to the recombinant ones, we conclude that 1) the N-linked
glycans present on the native spike are bulkier and contain elevated levels of complex-type
glycans; 2) the recapitulation of the main features of native viral glycosylation by soluble,
trimeric recombinant S glycoprotein is encouraging for vaccine strategies utilizing
recombinant S protein.
Native structure of S in the postfusion conformation.
Apart from the triangular prefusion S, needle-like densities were occasionally observed on the
viral envelope (Figure S2B). A 15.3 Å resolution structure was solved and well fitted with a
postfusion form of S (PDB: 6XRA), suggesting a postfusion conformation of the S protein.
The ectodomain measures 22.5 nm in length, 6 nm in width and stands perpendicular to the
viral envelope. Densities of five N-linked glycans (N1098, N1074, N1158, N1173 and N1194)
are displayed on the spike (Figure 3D), reminiscent to the recombinant postfusion structures
(Cai et al., 2020; Fan et al., 2020). In comparison to the prefusion conformation, the fixation
in orientation to the envelope suggests a dramatic conformational reordering of the stem region
to achieve the postfusion conformation. The postfusion S were found only on a small fraction
of the viruses (18% of all viruses, each carried an average of 5 postfusion S), hindering us from
reaching higher resolutions. Interestingly, among postfusion S-carrying virions, the virions
possessing less spikes in total tend to have higher proportion of postfusion S (Figure 3C).
Statistics on the refined coordinates (Figures 3A-3C) suggested a tendency of the postfusion S
to bundle on the viral surface. One such bundle was reconstructed, showing four postfusion S
spaced by ~10 nm on the viral surface (Figure 3B), compared to ~15 nm average distance
between the nearest prefusion S.
Distinguished from the SARS-CoV virus, which was estimated to possess an average of ~50100 spikes per virion (Neuman et al., 2011), the SARS-CoV-2 virus possesses approximately
half of the prefusion S and occasionally some postfusion S. The postfusion S observed on the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.08.192104; this version posted August 12, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

SARS-CoV-2 virus may come from 1) products of occasional, spontaneous dissociation of S1
(Cai et al., 2020), which was cleaved by host proteinases; 2) syncytium naturally formed on
infected cells (Xia et al., 2020), when budding progeny virions carried a few residual postfusion
S from the cell surface; 3) sample preparation procedure, as cryo-EM images of ßpropiolactone fixed viruses showed most spikes present on the virus are postfusion-like (Liu et
al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020). Such instability of the prefusion S was reported on the other βcoronaviruses (Pallesen et al., 2017). In addition, the distribution graph (Figure 3C) implies
that the kinetically trapped prefusion S is more fragile than the postfusion S, and could even
dissociate from the virus. The speculation is based on the fact that intracellular virions possess
more spikes on average (Klein et al., 2020) than the extracellular virions reported by us and
the others (Turoňová, 2020; Ke et al., 2020), and the occasional observation of spike-less
“bald” virus in our data.
In summary, we speculate that the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion S are unstable, indicating that the
distribution of solvent exposed epitopes on the virions is more complicated than the
observations on the recombinant proteins. Our observation has implications for efficient
vaccine design and neutralizing antibody development, which prefer a sufficient number of
stable antigens.
Architecture and assembly of the RNPs in intact virions.
It remains enigmatic how coronaviruses pack the ~30 kb RNA within the ~80 nm diameter
viral lumen; if the RNPs are ordered relative to each other to avoid RNA entangling, knotting
or even damaging; or if the RNPs are involved in virus assembly. When raw tomogram slices
were inspected, densely packed, bucket-like densities were discernible throughout the virus
lumen, some of which appeared to be locally ordered (Figure S5A). Combining previous cryoET observation on coronaviruses (Barcena et al., 2009) and SDS-PAGE/MS analysis (Figure
2C), the densities most likely belonged to the RNPs.
In total 18,500 RNPs were picked in the viral lumen, and initially aligned using a sphere as the
template and a large spherical mask. A bucket-like conformation with little structural feature
emerged adjacent to the density for lipid bilayer (Figure S5D), suggesting that a significant
number of RNPs were membrane proximal. Alignment using a small spherical mask revealed
a 13.1 Å resolution reverse G-shaped architecture of the RNP, measuring 15 nm in diameter
and 16 nm in height (Figure 4B). Its shape is in good comparison to a recently reported SARS-

CoV-2 RNP conformation (Klein et al., 2020), as well as the in situ conformation of the
chikungunya viral RNP, which is also positive stranded (Jin et al., 2018), but different from
the MHV RNP released using detergent (Gui et al., 2017).
The map was segmented into five head-to-tail reverse L-shaped densities, each fitted with a
pair of N proteins (N terminus domain (N_NTD): 6WKP, C terminus domain (N_CTD): 6WJI)
dimerized by the N_CTD (Chen et al., 2007) (Figure S6A and S6C). We analyzed the
electrostatic potential distribution on the surface of the decamer, and suggested a tentative
structural model of RNA winded RNP (Figures S6B and S6D). Interestingly, an early
observation on the MHV RNPs showed ~15 nm diameter helices with five subunits per turn
(Caul and Eggleston, 1979). Due to the limited resolution and little previous structural
knowledge about the (+) RNA virus RNPs, our model shall be interpreted with caution.
Further 2D classification of the RNPs revealed three classes: 1) closely packed against the
envelope, 2) hexagonally and 3) triangularly packed RNPs (Figure 4A). Following 3D
refinement, a membrane proximal, “eggs-in-a-nest” shaped RNP assembly (referred to as the
“hexon”), and a membrane-free, “pyramid” shaped RNP assembly (referred to as the
“tetrahedron”) emerged (Figures 4C and S5E-S5G). Projection of the two class averages back
onto their refined coordinates revealed that the majority of hexons came from spherical virions,
while more tetrahedrons from ellipsoidal virions (Figure 4D). This was quantified by statistics:
ellipsoidal virions tend to pack more RNP tetrahedrons (Figure 4E). Furthermore, the spacing
between two neighboring RNPs (~18 nm) is the same for both the tetrahedrons and hexons,
and some tetrahedrons could assemble into hexons when projected onto their in situ coordinates
(Figure S5B), suggesting that the RNP triangle is a key and basic packing unit throughout the
virus. We further propose that the RNPs are involved in coronavirus assembly and help
strengthen the virus against environmental and physical challenges, as purified virions
remained intact after five cycles of freeze-and-thaw treatment (Figure S7). Such involvement
of RNPs in viral assembly was also reported by (Neuman et al., 2006), who showed RNPs form
a lattice underneath the envelope; as well as seen in intracellular virions (Steffen Klein et al.,
2020). However, it remains unanswered if the ultrastructures of RNPs are assembled by RNA,
the transmembrane M or E proteins, the RNP itself, or multiples of the above.
Solving RNPs to subnanometer resolution was hindered by the crowding of RNPs against each
other (Figures S5E-S5G). Furthermore, structural features of the RNPs on higher order
assemblies smeared, possibly due to the symmetry mis-match between individual RNPs and

the assembly (Figures 4C and 4D). No virus with strictly ordered RNPs throughout the lumen
was found by projections. We conclude that the native RNPs are highly heterogeneous, densely
packed yet locally ordered in the virus, possibly interacting with the RNA in a beads-on-astring stoichiometry.
From ~2,300 intact virions and over 300 tilt series, we provide molecular insights into the
structures of spikes in the pre- and postfusion conformations, the RNPs and how they assemble
on the authentic virus. We also analyzed the detailed glycan compositions of the native spikes.
The reconstructed virus map (Figure 1B) consisting the RBD down S, one RBD up S, lipid
envelope and RNP components of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 has been deposited in the
Electron Microscopy Data Bank under accession codes EMD-30430, which provide a model
for full virus molecular dynamic simulation, 3D printing, education or public media in the
future.

Figure 1. Molecular architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. (A) A representative tomogram
slice (5 Å thick) showing pleomorphic SARS-CoV-2 virions. (B) A representative virus (boxed
in A) is reconstructed by projecting the prefusion S in RBD down conformation (salmon) and
one RBD up conformation (red), lipid envelope (grey), and RNPs (yellow) onto their refined
coordinates. RNPs away from the envelope are hidden for clarity. The unsolved stem regions
of the spikes are sketched from a predicted model (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/
COVID-19). (C) Summary of structural observations. Upper: number of prefusion S and RNPs
per virion; Lower left: ratio of the S proteins between RBD down and one RBD up
conformations; Lower right: statistics of the dimension of SARS-CoV-2 viral envelopes. (D)
Distribution of the spike tilt angle reveals a prevailing tilt of 40o relative to the normal axis of
the envelope. Shown here is a representative RBD down spike in authentic orientation to the
envelope (grey). The spike is colored by local resolution, and the predicted model of the stem
is fitted for illustration purpose.

Figure 2. Native structure of the S protein in the prefusion conformation. (A) S in RBD down
(resolution 8.7 Å, threshold: 1.2) and one RBD up (resolution 10.9 Å, threshold: 1.5)
conformations. Sideview (upper) and topview (lower) of the maps respectively fitted with PDB
entries 6XR8 and 6VYB are shown. (B) The RBD down S maps fitted with PDB entry 6XR8.
Densities of ten glycans are highlighted in insets. (C) Compositional analysis of the viral
sample. The treated viruses, designated ZJU_5, were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized
by Coomassie blue staining. Lane (1) protein ladder; (2) purified ZJU_5; (3) ZJU_5 treated
with PNGase F and (4) PNGase F as control. After PNGase F treatment, the molecular weight
of the S1 subunit is reduced by ~30 kDa, and S2 by ~20 kDa in weight. (D) Compositional
analysis of the surface glycans. The identity and proportion of 22 N-linked glycans from the
native S glycans were analyzed by mass spectrometry and presented in pie charts.

Figure 3. Native structure of S2 in the postfusion conformation. (A) A representative
tomogram slice (5 nm thick) showing a cluster of spikes in postfusion conformation on a
SARS-CoV-2 virion. (B) 3D reconstructions of S2 in postfusion state. The boxed region in (A)
is reconstructed by projecting the solved postfusion S structure onto their refined coordinates.
Resolution: 15.3 Å, threshold: 1.0. (C) Distribution of the postfusion S. Left: Statistics indicate
that the postfusion S are closer to each other on the viral surface compared to the prefusion S;
Right: viruses possessing less spikes in total tend to have more postfusion S (only virions
possessing postfusion S were counted). (D) The postfusion S structure fitted with PDB: 6XRA,
displaying densities of N1098, N1074, N1158, N1173 and N1194. Density of N1134 is not
visible on the map and is colored grey.

Figure 4. Native assembly of the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). (A) 2D class averages of RNPs
reveal two distinctive types of the RNP ultrastructure: hexameric (boxed in orange) and
tetrahedral (boxed in red) assembly. (B) 3D reconstruction and 2D slices of the RNP.
Resolution: 13.1 Å, threshold: 1. (C) Ultrastructure of the RNP hexon and tetrahedron
assemblies. Seven RNPs are packed against the viral envelope (grey), forming an “eggs-in-anest” shaped hexagonal assembly (upper). Four RNPs are packed as a membrane-free
tetrahedral assembly (lower), most of which were found inside the virus away from the
envelope. Structural features of the RNPs on the assembly are smeared due to the symmetry
mis-match between individual RNPs and the assembly. (D) Representative projection of the
RNP hexons assembling into a spherical virus, and tetrahedrons into an ellipsoidal virus. (E)
Statistics of the ratio of tetrahedron/hexon assembly reveals that the spherical and ellipsoidal
virions are more likely to be packed with hexons and tetrahedrons, respectively. The ratio is
estimated by sorting 382 virions that have over 5 RNP assemblies by their ratio of long/short
axis and counting their ratio of tetrahedron to hexon RNPs.
