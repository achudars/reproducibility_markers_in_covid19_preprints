Abstract

24

SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 emerged in late 2019 and resulted in a devastating

25

pandemic. Although the first approved vaccines were already administered by the

26

end of 2020, vaccine availability is still limited. Moreover, immune escape variants of

27

the virus are emerging against which the current vaccines may confer only limited

28

protection. Further, existing antivirals and treatment options against COVID-19 only

29

show limited efficacy. Influenza A virus (IAV) defective interfering particles (DIPs)

30

were previously proposed not only for antiviral treatment of the influenza disease but

31

also for pan-specific treatment of interferon (IFN)-sensitive respiratory virus

32

infections. To investigate the applicability of IAV DIPs as an antiviral for the

33

treatment of COVID-19, we conducted in vitro co-infection experiments with

34

produced, cell culture-derived DIPs and the IFN-sensitive SARS-CoV-2. We show that

35

treatment with IAV DIPs leads to complete abrogation of SARS-CoV-2 replication.

36

Moreover, this inhibitory effect was dependent on janus kinase/signal transducers

37

and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. These results suggest an

38

unspecific stimulation of the innate immunity by IAV DIPs as a major contributor in

39

suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Thus, we propose IAV DIPs as an effective

40

antiviral agent for treatment of COVID-19, and potentially also for suppressing the

41

replication of new variants of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

46

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing coronavirus

47

disease 2019 (COVID-19), poses a severe burden to public health, economy and

48

society. To date, almost 2.5 million cases of deaths were reported in the context of

49

SARS-CoV-2 infection (WHO, covid19.who.int). Starting early 2020, there has been a

50

unprecedented race for the development of novel vaccines, their production, and

51

safety and immunogenicity studies in clinical trials (Krammer, 2020, Walsh et al.,

52

2020, Voysey et al., 2020, Jackson et al., 2020, Logunov et al., 2020, Palacios et al.,

53

2020). First individuals were already vaccinated at the end of 2020. While vaccination

54

typically provides the best protection against virus infections and disease onset, the

55

production capacity of COVID-19 vaccines, and the infrastructure required for

56

vaccination is still limiting. In addition, vaccination cannot be used for therapeutic

57

treatment of acute infections. Therefore, as an alternative option, the use of

58

antivirals for treatment of COVID-19 is essential. Yet, remdesivir (in clinical use)

59

showed only limited efficacy (Wang et al., 2020, Beigel et al., 2020, Pan et al.,

60

2020), while other repurposed drug candidates (e.g., hydroxychloroquine and

61

lopinavir-ritonavir) showed a lack of efficacy (Boulware et al., 2020, Cao et al.,

62

2020). In addition, corticosteroids (i.e., dexamethasone (Tomazini et al., 2020)) and

63

cocktails of monoclonal antibodies (e.g., bamlanivimab (Chen et al., 2020b)) are

64

used in the clinic and show an antiviral effect. However, the appearance of new

65

SARS-CoV-2 variants poses a constant risk to lose efficacy of highly specific

66

treatments, including vaccination and therapeutic antibodies. Thus, there is a need to

67

develop more broadly acting, cost-effective antivirals that ideally are easily scalable

68

in production.

69

Influenza A virus (IAV) defective interfering particles (DIPs) were previously

70

proposed for antiviral treatment against Influenza A infections (Zhao et al., 2018,

71

Vignuzzi and Lopez, 2019, Meir et al., 2020, Tapia et al., 2019, Yang et al., 2019,

72

Harding et al., 2019, Tanner et al., 2016, Huo et al., 2020b), but also for pan-specific

73

treatment of other respiratory viral diseases (Dimmock and Easton, 2014, Dimmock

74

and Easton, 2015). IAV DIPs typically carry a large internal deletion in their genome,

75

rendering them defective in virus replication (Alnaji and Brooke, 2020, Ziegler and

76

Botten, 2020, Andreu-Moreno and Sanjuan, 2020). Furthermore, DIPs suppress and

77

interfere specifically with homologous viral replication in a co-infection scenario, a

78

process known as replication interference. As a result, administration of IAV DIPs to

79

mice resulted in full protection against an otherwise lethal IAV infection (Dimmock et

80

al., 2008, Huo et al., 2020b, Hein et al., 2021)(Hein et al., submitted). In the ferret

81

model, treatment of IAV-infected animals resulted in a reduced severity of disease

82

pathogenesis (Dimmock et al., 2012). Intriguingly, mice were also protected against

83

a lethal infection with the unrelated influenza B virus (Scott et al., 2011) and

84

pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) from the family Paramyxoviridae (Easton et al.,

85

2011). Here, protection was not attributed to replication interference but to the

86

ability of IAV DIPs to stimulate innate immunity.

87

SARS-CoV-2 replication seems to modulate and inhibit the interferon (IFN) response

88

in infected target cells (Chen et al., 2020a, Konno et al., 2020, Lei et al., 2020). Still,

89

it was also shown to be susceptible to inhibition by exogenously added IFNs in vitro

90

(Busnadiego et al., 2020, Felgenhauer et al., 2020), in vivo (Hoagland et al., 2021)

91

and in clinical trials (Monk et al., 2020). Therapies using recombinant IFNs, however,

92

are cost intensive and pose the risk of unwanted side effects including the formation

93

of auto-antibodies against the cytokine (reviewed in (Sleijfer et al., 2005)). To

94

prevent this, we wondered whether IAV DIPs would be able to suppress SARS-CoV-2

95

replication through their ability to stimulate a physiological IFN response in target

96

cells. To test this, we produced two promising candidate DIPs: a prototypic, well-

97

characterized conventional IAV DIP “DI244” (Dimmock and Easton, 2014), and a

98

novel type of IAV DIP “OP7”, that contains point mutations instead of a large internal

99

deletion in the genome (Kupke et al., 2019) using a cell culture-based production

100

process (Hein et al., 2021)(Hein et al., submitted).

101

Here, we used Calu-3 cells (human lung cancer cell line) for in vitro co-infection

102

experiments with SARS-CoV-2 and DI244 or OP7, respectively. Both DIPs were able

103

to completely inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and spreading in a range comparable to

104

IFN-β or remdesivir treatment. Moreover, we show that the inhibitory effect of IAV

105

DIPs was due to their ability to induce innate immune responses that signal via janus

106

kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT). Yet, additional

107

mechanisms may also play a role. Thus, we propose IAV DIPs as effective antiviral

108

agents for the treatment of COVID-19 and, potentially as universal antiviral agents

109

not only against different influenza subtypes but also against other (including newly

110

emerging) IFN-sensitive respiratory viruses.

Results

112

SARS-CoV-2 replication is abrogated by IAV DIP treatment in vitro

113

In order to test the antiviral efficacy of IAV DIPs on replication of SARS-CoV-2, we

114

conducted in vitro co-infection experiments in Calu-3 cells. For this, we infected cells

115

with SARS-CoV-2 (multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.03) and highly concentrated IAV

116

DIPs (DI244 or OP7), respectively, from cell culture-based production and

117

chromatographic purification (Marichal-Gallardo et al., 2017, Hein et al., 2021)(Hein

118

et al., submitted). At 3 days post infection (dpi), cells were stained for the SARS-

119

CoV-2 spike (S) protein (Fig. 1A). Indeed, S protein expression was significantly

120

reduced in cells co-treated with DI244 or OP7 compared to cells infected with SARS-

121

CoV-2 only, indicating efficient suppression of SARS-CoV-2 replication by IAV DIP co-

122

infection. In agreement with this observation, images from live-cell microscopy show

123

a significant amelioration of the cytopathic effect upon DIP co-infection (Fig. 1B).

124

Next, different concentrations of IAV DIPs were tested for the treatment of SARS-

125

CoV-2-infected cells (Fig. 1C). As a read-out for SARS-CoV-2 replication, we

126

determined the plaque titer from supernatants at 3 dpi using adherent Vero-6 cells.

127

Please note that infection with only defective, replication-incompetent IAV DIPs does

128

not result in the release progeny virions, as demonstrated by negative plaque titers

129

(Hein et al., 2021)(Hein et al., submitted). Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 replication was

130

severely diminished upon IAV DIP co-infection. In particular, at high DI244 and OP7

131

concentrations, no SARS-CoV-2 plaque titers were detectable anymore, while

132

untreated cells showed a titer of 7.5 x 104 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL.

133

Suppression of SARS-CoV-2 replication decreased with increasing dilution of DIPs.

134

Remarkably, though, the treatment with both DIPs at a dilution of 1:1000 still

135

resulted in a pronounced inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication, corresponding to a 26-

136

fold and 210-fold reduction in plaque titers for DI244 and OP7 treatment,

137

respectively. For comparison, we also tested the inhibitory capacity of IFN-β or

138

remdesivir treatment on SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected target cells. Both agents

139

were also able to diminish SARS-CoV-2 plaque titers to below the LOD, until a

140

concentration of 633 U/mL for IFN-β and 0.32 µM for remdesivir. Yet, inhibiting

141

effects ceased significantly faster with increasing dilutions, most apparently observed

142

for remdesivir, for which treatment with a concentration of 0.03 µM already did not

143

result an inhibitory effect anymore.

144

Fig. 1D illustrates SARS-CoV-2 inhibition caused by inactivated DIPs. These DIPs

145

were previously UV irradiated until no interfering efficacy against IAV replication was

146

observed anymore in vitro (Hein et al., 2021)(Hein et al., submitted). This suggests

147

the complete inactivation of the causative interfering agent, i.e., the defective

148

interfering (DI) viral RNA (vRNA). Nevertheless, inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication

149

by inactivated DIPs was still detectable (Fig. 1D). More specifically, we still observed

150

a residual suppression of plaque titers. This may be explained by an unspecific

151

stimulation of the innate immunity by inactivated virus particles, which still have the

152

capacity to enter target cells and to switch on antiviral processes that ultimately

153

suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, the finding that the inhibition caused by

154

active DIPs was more efficient clearly suggests a specific activity of IAV DIPs, leading

155

to interference with SARS-CoV-2 replication and spreading. Of note, active DIPs still

156

conferred a pronounced antiviral effect even when applied 24 h after preceding

157

SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 1E).

158

In conclusion, treatment with both DI244 and OP7 IAV DIPs completely abolished

159

SARS-CoV-2 replication during in vitro co-infections. While the inhibitory potential

160

was comparable to IFN-β and remdesivir treatment, the antiviral effects of IAV DIPs

161

were more sustained with increasing dilution.

Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by IAV DIPs caused by stimulation of

181

Next, to investigate our hypothesis whether inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by

182

DIPs was due to their ability to stimulate the IFN system, we used ruxolitinib in co-

183

infection experiments. This small molecule drug is an efficient inhibitor of JAK, which

184

are key effectors in the IFN system. Upon IFN sensing, JAKs typically recruit STATs,

185

ultimately leading to the upregulation of IFN-stimulated gene (ISGs). ISGs encode for

186

effector molecules that limit viral replication by inducing an antiviral state in the

187

infected as well as uninfected neighboring cells. Fig. 2 shows the results of SARS-

188

CoV-2 and IAV DIP co-infection upon treatment with ruxolitinib. While DI244 and

189

OP7 co-infection almost completely inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, additional

190

treatment with ruxolitinib abrogated the suppressive effect of both IAV DIPs.

191

Specifically, virus titers under JAK signaling inhibition were comparable to SARS-CoV-

192

2 infection in the absence of DIPs. In conclusion, these results suggest a major

193

contribution of unspecific innate immune activation by IAV DIPs in interfering with

194

SARS-CoV-2 replication.

Discussion

205

Despite the recent availability of vaccines against COVID-19, options for antiviral

206

treatment are urgently needed for therapeutic application. Here, we show that

207

produced, cell culture-derived IAV DIPs are highly potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2

208

replication in human lung cells. In addition, our data obtained in in vitro experiments

209

suggest that suppression of SARS-CoV-2 replication by IAV DIPs is predominantly

210

attributed to their ability to stimulate innate immune responses ultimately inducing

211

an antiviral state in target cells.

212

In the clinic, already approved antivirals for treatment of COVID-19 showed only very

213

limited efficacy. For instance, treatment with the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir did

214

not result in an overall decrease in mortality (Beigel et al., 2020, Pan et al., 2020).

215

For patients receiving supplemental oxygen, however, an improvement in the

216

survival rate from about 4% to 12% was observed (Beigel et al., 2020). In addition,

217

the time required to recover from COVID-19 was decreased by five days (Wang et

218

al., 2020, Beigel et al., 2020). Another option to treat COVID-19 is the use of

219

monoclonal antibodies that target the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S

220

protein, thereby inhibiting engagement with the host cell entry receptor angiotensin-

221

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Hoffmann et al., 2020, Abraham, 2020). Here, it was

222

suggested to use antibody cocktails to prevent the emergence of viral escape

223

variants in treated individuals (Baum et al., 2020). In clinical trials, treatment of

224

outpatients with one such an antibody cocktail (i.e., bamlanivimab) accelerated the

225

decrease in viral load and reduced the fraction of patients requiring hospitalization

226

from 6.3% to 1.6% (Chen et al., 2020b). The administration of the corticosteroid

227

dexamethasone (in clinical use) resulted in an overall lower mortality in critically ill

228

COVID-19 patients (Horby et al., 2020, Sterne et al., 2020). This has a caveat,

229

though, as a decrease in mortality was observed for patients requiring oxygen

230

(including mechanical ventilation), but an increase in mortality was reported for

231

patients not requiring oxygen (Horby et al., 2020).

232

Treatment of COVID-19 patients with IFNs has not been approved yet. In general,

233

SARS-CoV-2 infection modulates and inhibits the IFN response (Chen et al., 2020a,

234

Konno et al., 2020, Lei et al., 2020). Moreover, it was recently shown that the host

235

cell entry receptor ACE2 is indeed an ISG, and it was speculated that SARS-CoV-2

236

may exploit the IFN-driven upregulation of ACE2 to enhance infection (Ziegler et al.,

237

2020). However, SARS-CoV-2 replication was also shown to be susceptible to

238

inhibition by exogenously added IFN. For instance, all IFNs (type I, II and III)

239

exhibited potent antiviral activity with SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro (Busnadiego et

240

al., 2020, Felgenhauer et al., 2020), suggesting that the antiviral activities of IFNs

241

may counterbalance any proviral effects derived from ACE2 induction. In agreement

242

with this, intranasal IFN-I administration (in hamsters) pre- or post-virus challenge

243

was shown to reduce SARS-CoV-2 disease burden (Hoagland et al., 2021). Moreover,

244

in a placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial, administration of inhaled, nebulized IFN

245

beta-1a resulted in a higher chance of disease improvement and a more rapid

246

recovery from COVID-19 (Monk et al., 2020).

247

In our cell culture experiments, IAV DIPs completely abrogated SARS-CoV-2

248

replication. Notably, the UV-irradiated and thus inactive DIP material also showed a

249

residual inhibitory effect. Yet, the observation of a much stronger antiviral effect

250

upon treatment with active DIPs hints to a specific activity of IAV DIPs in the context

251

of SARS-CoV-2 suppression. DIPs are defective in virus replication, and thus they fail

252

to complete the entire infection cycle. However, the incoming genomic vRNAs,

253

packaged into a viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex (Eisfeld et al., 2015), still

254

show polymerase activity and transcribe viral mRNAs (Vreede et al., 2004, Heldt et

255

al., 2012, Vreede and Brownlee, 2007). In particular, the short DI vRNAs (and likely,

256

also the resulting short DI mRNAs) were shown to be preferentially bound by the

257

retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) protein (Baum and Garcia-Sastre, 2011), which

258

subsequently leads to the activation of an IFN-response (Rehwinkel et al., 2010).

259

Our results support the notion that IAV DIPs do not only protect host cells from IAV

260

infection but, in addition, may generally confer protection against other heterologous

261

IFN-sensitive respiratory viruses (Easton et al., 2011, Scott et al., 2011, Dimmock

262

and Easton, 2015). Considering the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants that

263

render the efficacy of various vaccine candidates questionable, the unspecific

264

stimulation of innate immunity by IAV DIPs may be advantageous; in particular,

265

regarding a potential universal efficacy against such new (and future) variants.

266

Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed an antiviral effect of IAV DIPs

267

(derived from strains originally isolated in 1933 and 1934) against a variety of

268

different IAV subtypes that have been isolated between 1933-2014, including

269

pandemic and highly pathogenic avian IAV strains (Dimmock et al., 2008, Dimmock

270

et al., 2012, Zhao et al., 2018, Huo et al., 2020a).

271

Future work to investigate the feasibility to use IAV DIPs against SARS-CoV-2

272

infection will comprise animal trials in Syrian hamsters, which are (in contrast to

273

mice) highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 and develop a similar lung disease compared

274

to human COVID-19 (Kaptein et al., 2020, Boudewijns et al., 2020, Chan et al.,

275

2020). As an alternative approach, SARS-CoV-2/IAV DIP co-infection studies to clarify

276

the therapeutic effects of IAV DIPs on the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to

277

decipher in more detail the underlying mode of action may be performed in

278

humanized K18-hACE2 mice. These mice are genetically modified to express the

279

human ACE2 receptor rendering them susceptible for SARS-CoV-2 infection and have

280

recently been shown to develop respiratory disease resembling severe COVID-19 in

281

humans (Yinda et al., 2021). Animal experiments will help to elaborate on the

282

potential applicability of IAV DIPs as a pre- and post-exposure treatment for instance

283

in acute SARS-CoV-2 outbreak scenarios in the clinics or geriatric institutions. In

284

addition to vaccination, this would represent an interesting option for prophylactic

285

treatment to boost antiviral immunity in persons at acute risk for an infection or for

286

therapeutic treatment during an early phase post infection and as such may prevent

287

fatal COVID-19 outcomes.

Materials and methods

289

Cells and viruses

290

Vero-6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were maintained in DMEM medium (Gibco, 4.5 g/L

291

glucose, w/o pyruvate) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Biowest,

292

S1810-6500), 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 1x GlutaMax (Gibco)

293

and 1x sodium pyruvate (Gibco). Calu-3 cells (ATCC HTB-55) were cultured in MEM

294

(Sigma) supplemented with 10% FCS (Biowest, S1810-6500), 100 IU/mL penicillin,

295

100 μg/mL streptomycin, 1x GlutaMax (Gibco) and 1x sodium pyruvate (Gibco).

296

Caco-2 cells (ATCC HTB-37) were grown in MEM (Gibco) supplemented with 20 %

297

FCS (Biowest, S1810-6500), 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 1x

298

GlutaMax (Gibco) and 1x non-essential amino acid solution (Gibco). All cells were

299

maintained or infected at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.

300

The IAV DIPs DI244 and OP7 were produced in a cell culture-based process using a

301

500 mL laboratory scale stirred tank bioreactor, followed by purification and

302

concentration by membrane-based steric exclusion chromatography (Marichal-

303

Gallardo et al., 2017), as described previously (Hein et al., 2021)(Hein et al.,

304

submitted). Production titers of 3.3 and 3.67 log hemagglutination (HA) units/100µL

305

(quantified by the HA assay (Kalbfuss et al., 2008)) and 5.6 x 108 and 1.12 x 1011 DI

306

vRNAs/mL (quantified by real-time RT-qPCR (Kupke et al., 2019, Hein et al., 2021,

307

Wasik et al., 2018)) were achieved for DI244 and OP7, respectively.

308

The SARS-CoV-2 isolate hCoV-19/Croatia/ZG-297-20/2020 was used. All experiments

309

with infectious SARS-CoV-2 were performed in the BSL-3 facility at the Helmholtz

was produced in Caco-2 cells, and virus particles were enriched in Vivaspin 20

312

columns (Sartorius Stedim, Biotech) via centrifugation. Collected virus was stored at -

313

80°C. SARS-CoV-2 titers were quantified by plaque assay.

314

315

Plaque assay

316

Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 was performed by plaque assay. Samples were serially

317

diluted in 10-fold steps, and used to infect a confluent monolayer of Vero-6 cells (on

318

96-well plates) for 1 h. Then, the inoculum was removed and cells were overlaid with

319

cell culture medium containing 1.5% methyl-cellulose (SIGMA, #C9481-500). At 3

320

dpi, cells were fixed with 6% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. Wells

321

were imaged using a Sartorius IncuCyte S3 (4x objective, whole-well scan) and

322

plaque counts were determined.

SARS-CoV-2 infection and antiviral treatment

325

Confluent Calu-3 cells in 96-well plates (~6 x 104 cells/well) were infected with SARS-

326

CoV-2 (2000 PFU per well). At 1 or 24 hpi, we added active or inactive IAV DIPs

327

(DI244 or OP7) at indicated fractions (% v/v) with respect to the cell culture volume

328

of 100 µL. Whenever indicated, we additionally added 0.8 µM ruxolitinib (Cayman

329

Chemical, Cat. #Cay11609-1) to these wells. Alternatively, remdesivir (MedChem

330

Express, #HY-104077) or human IFN-β-1A (PBL assay science, #11415-1) (instead

331

of IAV DIPs) were added at indicated concentrations at 1 hpi. Supernatants were

Immunofluorescence staining

336

SARS-CoV-2 infected cells were fixed with 6% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at

337

room temperature, followed by washing with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with

338

0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, and

339

blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h. Antibody labelling was performed with mouse

340

anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Abcalis, clone AB68-A09, #ABK68-A09-M) and secondary

341

antibody anti-mouse Alexa488 (Cell Signaling Technology, #4408), each step

342

followed by three washing steps with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20. Finally, cells

343

were overlaid with Vectashield mouting medium (Biozol, #VEC-H-1000).
