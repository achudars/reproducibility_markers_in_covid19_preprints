HIV-1-based vector system and tested their ability to infect
ACE2-expressing cells. This study revealed that a C-terminal 17 amino acid deletion
in SCoV-2 SP significantly increases the incorporation of SP into the pseudotyped
viruses and enhanced its infectivity, which may be helpful in the design of
SCoV2-SP-based vaccine strategies. Moreover, based on this system, we have
demonstrated that an aqueous extract from the Chinese herb Prunella vulgaris
(CHPV) and a compound, suramin, displayed potent inhibitory effects on both wild
type and mutant (G614) SCoV-2 SP pseudotyped virus (SCoV-2-SP-PVs)-mediated
infection. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for CHPV and suramin on
SCoV-2-SP-PVs are 30, and 40 µg/ml, respectively. To define the mechanisms of
their actions, we demonstrated that both CHPV and suramin are able to directly
interrupt SCoV-2–SP binding to its receptor ACE2 and block the viral entry step.
Importantly, our results also showed that CHPV or suramin can efficiently reduce
levels
of
cytopathic
effect
caused
by
SARS-CoV-2
virus
(hCoV-19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020) infection in Vero cells. Furthermore, our
results demonstrated that the combination of CHPV/suramin with an
anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody mediated more potent blocking effect against
SCoV2-SP-PVs. Overall, this study provides evidence that CHPV and suramin has
anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and may be developed as a novel antiviral approach
against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

1	   Introduction
2	   The recent and ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has
3	   called for serious and urgent global attention [1,2]. The COVID-19 disease is caused
4	   by a newly emerged virus strain of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
5	   known as SARS-CoV-2 [3]. Although the case fatality ratio (CFR) of COVID-19 can
6	   only be detected at the end of the outbreak, an estimated global CFR was calculated
7	   to be 5.5-5.7% in March 2020, which is shockingly more than seasonal influenza
8	   outbreak [4]. While in August 2020, the infection fatality ratio was estimated by WHO
9	   to be 0.5-1% [5]. Since the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences [6], extensive
10	   efforts worldwide have been focused on the development of vaccine and antiviral
11	   drugs against SARS-CoV-2 with the hope to rapidly and efficiently control this new
12	   human coronavirus (CoV) infection.
13	  
14	   SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a betacoronavirus subfamily that includes enveloped, large
15	   and positive-stranded RNA viruses responsible for causing severe respiratory system,
16	   gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms [7-10]. The human CoV was first
17	   identified in 1960 and constituted about 30% of the causes of the common cold.
18	   Among the identified human CoVs are NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, the
19	   Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 [11,12]. A recent
20	   study has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was closely related (88% identity) to two
21	   SARS-like CoVs that were isolated from bats in 2018 in China, but it was less related
22	   to SARS-CoV (79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%) [13]. The key determinant for the
23	   infectivity
24	  
25

of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the host specificity with the viral
surface-located trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein (SP), which is commonly cleaved by
host proteases into an N-terminal S1 subunit and a membrane-embedded C-terminal
S2 region [14]. Recent studies revealed that a SP mutation, Aspartic acid (D)
changed to Glycine (G) at amino acid position 614, in the S1 domain has been found
in high frequency (65% to 70%) in April to May of 2020, that was associated with an
increased viral load and significantly higher transmission rate in infected individuals,
but no significant change with disease severity [15]. Following studies also suggested
that G614 SP mutant pseudotyped retroviruses infected ACE2-expressing cells
markedly more efficiently than those with D614 SP [16].

33	  
34	   Up till now, several compounds have been tested in numerous clinical trials, including
35	   remdesivir, lopinavir, umifenovir, and hydroxychloroquine [17-21]. Moreover, some in
36	   vitro

research suggested that other drugs such as fusion peptide (EK1),
anti-inflammatory drugs (such as hormones and other molecules) could be potentially
used in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 disease (reviewed in [22,23]). However, their
safety and efficacy have not been confirmed by clinical trials. Currently, specific
antiviral treatment drugs are still not available for SARS-CoV-2 infections [23].

41	  
42	   Traditional Chinese medicine holds a unique position among all conventional
43	   medicines because of its usage over more than hundreds of years of history. Many
44	   aqueous extracts of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs have been proven to have

1	   antiviral activities [24], and most of these are generally of low toxicity, cheap and
2	   readily accessible. As an easily accessible and low-cost natural source, they are
3	   especially valuable as potential new sources for rapid responses against the ongoing
4	   COVID-19 pandemic. Prunella vulgaris, widely distributed in China, Europe,
5	   northwestern Africa and North America, is known as a self-heal herb and studies
6	   have previously found that a water-soluble substance from Chinese Herb Prunella
7	   vulgaris (CHPV) exhibit significant antiviral activity against HIV, HSV and Ebola virus
8	   [25-28]. However, whether CHPV can block SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is unknown.
9	   Another compound, Suramin, has also been previously shown to be a potent inhibitor
10	   against HIV [29], while the subsequent studies revealed that its inhibitory effects on
11	   HIV replication did not correlate with clinical or immunologic improvement [30,31]. A
12	   previous study observed that suramin not only substantially reduced viral loads of
13	   chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in infected mice, but it also ameliorated virus-induced foot
14	   lesions in the mice [32]. Recently, Salgado-Benvindo C., et al., reported that Suramin
15	   is able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture by interfering with early steps of
16	   the replication cycle [33].
17	  
18	   In this study, we have established a highly sensitive SARS-CoV-2 SP-pseudotyped
19	   virus (SCoV-2 SP-PVs) system and investigated the impact of the cytoplasmic tail
20	   and a G614 mutant of SP on virus entry ability. We also examined two compounds,
21	   CHPV and suramin, for their blocking activities in the SCoV-2 SP-PVs system and
22	   SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the antiviral mechanism of their actions. Furthermore, we
23	   investigated the synergistic effect of combining anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
24	   antibody (nAb) with CHPV or suramin to enhance their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity.
25	   Overall, this study provides evidence for the first time that CHPV, an aqueous extract
26	   from Prunella vulgaris, has potent anti- SARS-CoV-2 activity.

D614G-3’,
5_CTGTGCAGTTAACACCCTGATAAAGAACAGC. Mutated genes were cloned into the
pCAGGS plasmid and each mutation was confirmed by sequencing. The HIV vector
encoding for Gaussia luciferase gene HIV-1 RT/IN/Env tri-defective proviral plasmid
(ΔRI/E/Gluc) and the helper packaging plasmid pCMVΔ8.2 encoding for the HIV
Gag-Pol plasmids are described previously [26,34].

14	  
15	   Cell culture, antibodies and chemicals
16	   The human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) and kidney epithelial cells (VeroE6
17	   and Vero cells (ATCC, CCL-81)) from African green monkey were cultured in
18	   Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (HEK293T, VeroE6) or Minimum Essential
19	   Medium (MEM; Vero). HEK293T expressing ACE2 (293TACE2) was obtained from
20	   GeneCopoeia Inc, Rockville, MD. All cell lines were supplemented with 10% fetal
21	   bovine serum (FBS), 1X L-Glutamine and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. The rabbit
22	   polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 SP (Cat# 40150-R007) and ACE2 protein
23	   (Cat# 40592-T62) were obtained from Sino Biological and anti-HIVp24 monoclonal
24	   antibody was described previously [35,36]. The HIV-1 p24 ELISA Kit was obtained
25	   from the AIDS Vaccine Program of the Frederick Cancer Research and Development
26	   Center. SARS-CoV-2 SP-ACE2 binding ELISA kit (Cat# COV-SACE2-1) was
27	   purchased from RayBio. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing Antibody (nAb) Human
28	   IgG1(SAD-535) was purchased from ACRO Biosystems..
29	  
30	   Preparation and purification of herb extracts of P. vulgaris L (CHPV)
31	   The dried fruitspikes of P. vulgaris L. (Labiatae) (Fig. 3A) were first soaked overnight
32	   in deionized water at room temperature and then boiled for one hour. Then the cooled
33	   supernatant was centrifuged (3000 g, 30 min), filtered through a 0.45 µm cellulose
34	   acetate membrane and finally lyophilized, as described previously [25]. The resulting
35	   dark brown residue was dissolved in deionized water and stored at -20°C. A single
36	   symmetrical peak corresponding to a molecular weight of polysaccharides
37	   (approximately 10 kDa) in the aqueous extract from PV was detected by HPLC
38	   analysis, as described previously [25]. Suramin (Cat# sc-200833) was purchased
39	   from Santa Cruz BioTech and was dissolved in sterile H2O and stored at -20°.

1	   pCAGGS-SARS-CoV-2-SPΔCG614, pCMVΔ8.2 and a Gluc expressing HIV vector
2	   ΔRI/E/Gluc. After 48 hrs of transfection, cell culture supernatants were collected and
3	   pseudotyped VLPs were purified from the supernatant by ultracentrifugation (32,000
4	   rpm) for 2 hrs. The pelleted VPs were resuspended into RPMI medium and virus titers
5	   were quantified using an HIV-1 p24 ELISA assay. The wild type SARS-CoV-2
6	   (hCoV-19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020, GISAID accession# EPI_ISL_425177) was
7	   propagated and produced in Vero cells (ATCC, CCL-81).
8	  
9	   To investigate the infection ability of SCoV-2-SP-VPs, the same amount of each
10	   SCoV-2-SP-PV stock (as adjusted by p24 levels) were used to infect different target
5

11	   cells at 0.4 x 10 cells per well (24 well plate) for 3 hrs and washed. After 48 or 72 hrs,
12	   the supernatants were collected and the viral infection rate was evaluated by
13	   measuring Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) activity. Briefly, 50ul of Coelenterazine substrate
14	   (Nanolight Technology) was added to 20ul of supernatant, mixed well and read in the
15	   luminometer (Promega, USA).
16	  
17	   To evaluate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 SP-mediated entry activity of CHPV or suramin,
18	   various concentrations of herb extract or compound were directly added into target
19	   cells at different time points before or after infection, as indicated. After 3hrs of
20	   infection at 37°C, the cells were washed once to remove excessive residue
21	   viruses/compound and cultured in fresh medium. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects of
22	   CHPV or suramin were evaluated by measuring the Gluc activity or p24 levels in the
23	   supernatant infected cultures.

(hCoV19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020, GISAID accession# EPI_ISL_425177) was evaluated
in Vero cells. The Vero cells were seeded into 96-well plates and reached a
confluency of 90% at the second day. Then each compound was diluted in assay
medium (MEM with 1X penicillin-streptomycin) and added to the wells (100 ul/well),
followed by adding 100 µL of SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 0.01, resulting in a final 1X
drug concentrations. As positive controls, wells without drugs were infected with
SARS-CoV-2 at the same MOI. Cells were maintained for 72 hrs and then, virus
infection induced cytopathic effect (CPE) was monitored in each well.

35	   Binding Assay
36	   The inhibitory effect of CHPV or suramin on the interaction of SP-ACE2 was tested
37	   with COVID-19 Spike-ACE2 binding assay kit. Briefly, 96-well plate was coated with
38	   recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. CHPV or suramin was then added to the
39	   wells for 10 min followed by adding recombinant human ACE2 protein. After
40	   incubation for 3 hours, wells were washed three times and a goat anti-ACE2 antibody
41	   that binds to the Spike-ACE2 complex was added followed by applying the
42	   HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG and 3,3',5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate.
43	   The intensity of the yellow color is then measured at 450 nm.

2	   Results
3	   Generation of a SARS-CoV-2 SP-pseudotyped HIV-1-based entry system
4	   We first established a sensitive SARS-CoV-2-SP-mediated virus entry system by
5	   co-transfecting SARS-CoV-2 SP, a HIV-based vector (ΔRI/ΔEnv/Gluc) in which viral
6	   reverse transcriptase/integrase deleted/envelope gene partially deleted and encoded
7	   a Gaussia luciferase gene in the nef position [34], and a packaging plasmid
8	   (pCMVΔR8.2) in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1B). The Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) is a
9	   bioluminescent enzyme that can be secreted into the media, enabling the analysis of
10	   viral expression by direct measurement of Gluc activity in the supernatant. To do this,
11	   we have constructed a full length SP (SARS-CoV-2-SP) and the C-terminal 17 amino
12	   acid (aa) deletion SP (SARS-CoV-2-SPΔC) expressing plasmids since previous
13	   studies have reported that a carboxyl-terminal truncation of 17 amino acids of SARS
14	   SP substantially increased SARS SP-mediated cell-to-cell fusion [37].

and the SARS-COV-2-SP pseudotyped viruses (SP-PVs) and
SARS-COV-2-SPΔC pseudotyped viruses (SPΔC-PVs), lysates of both
virus-producing cells and pseudotyped viruses were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and WB
with a mouse anti-SP antibody, as indicated in Fig. 1C. As expected, the HIV capsid
Gagp24 protein was detected in all of the cell lysates and the pelleted SP-PVs and
SPΔC-PVs pseudoviruses (PVs) by rabbit anti-p24 antibodies (Fig. 1C, lower panel).
The SARS-CoV-2 SP including S1/S2 were clearly detected in both
SARS-CoV-2-SPs and SARS-CoV-2-SPΔC-transfected cells (Fig. 1C, lane 1).
Interestingly our results revealed that virus-incorporation level of SARS-CoV-2-SPΔC
were significantly higher than that of SARS-CoV-2-SP (Fig. 1C, compare lane 4 to 3),

27	  
28	   To test the infectivity of generated pseudoviruses, we infected 293T-ACE2 cells with
29	   serial diluted amounts of pseudoviruses (25, 12.5, 6.25ng of p24) of SP-PVs or
30	   SPΔC-PVs for 3 hrs. The Gluc activities or Gagp24 of supernatants from infected
31	   cells were measured at 24h, 48h or 72h post infection. The results showed that both
32	   SP-PVs and SPΔC-PVs can infect 293T-ACE2 cells and induce an increase of Gluc
33	   activity in the supernatants in a dose dependent manner (Fig.1D, left panel). As
34	   expected, the infectivity of SPΔC-PVs was significantly higher than that of SP-PVs.
35	   The infection of pseudoviruses in 293TACE2 cells was further confirmed by detection of
36	   the HIVp24 levels in the supernatants of infected cells through ELISA assay (Fig.1D,
37	   right panel).
38	  
39	   To test whether the infection is ACE2-dependent, we infected various cell lines,
40	   including HEK293T, 293TACE2 and VeroE6 with SP-PVs and SPΔC-PVs, respectively.
41	   The results showed that these pseudoviruses were only able to efficiently infect
42	   293TACE2 cells, and not HEK293T or VeroE6 cells (Fig. 2A). In parallel, we only
43	   detected high level expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 in 293TACE2 cells,
44	   but not in the 293T or Vero E6 cells (Fig. 2B).

1	   In addition, we have generated a GFP SARS-CoV-2-SP-mediated virus entry system
2	   by cotransfecting SARS-CoV-2 SPΔCG614, a lentiviral vector that expressing GFP,
3	   and the pCMVΔR8.2 in HEK293T cells and produced SPΔCG614-PVs expressing GFP

4	   (GFP SPΔCG614-PVs). After 293TACE2 cells were infected with GFP SPΔCG614-PVs,
5	   the GFP positive 293TACE2 cells were clearly detected under fluorescent microscopy
6	   (Fig. 2C)
7	  
8	   2. SARS-CoV-2 SP G614 variant exhibited stronger receptor association and
9	   virus entry.
10	   Recent sequence analyses revealed a SP mutation, Aspartic acid (D) changed to
11	   Glycine (G) at aa position 614, was found in high frequency (65% to 70%) in April to
12	   May of 2020, indicating a transmission advantage to D614 [15].

In this study, we
(Fig. 1A,c) and
compared its virus entry ability with SCoV-2-SPΔC (SPΔCD614). Our results showed
that SCoV-2-SPΔCG614 was incorporated into pseudotyped viruses similar to
SCoV-2-SPΔCD614 (Fig. 2D, compare lane 5 to lane 4). However, the
SARS-CoV2-SPΔCG614-pseudotyped viral particles (SPΔCG614-PVs) mediated
approximately 3-fold higher infection than that of SPΔCD614-PVs (Fig. 2E), suggesting
that the SPG614 mutation increases SP-mediated viral entry.

21	   Evaluation of CHPV and Suramin for blocking SARS-CoV2-SP-mediated virus
22	   entry
23	   Next we tested whether CHPV (Fig. 3A) and suramin could block SARS-CoV2
24	   SP-mediated virus entry of 293TACE2 cells. Briefly, 293TACE2 cells were infected
25	   with SPΔC-PVs in the presence of different concentrations (25, 50,75, 100 and
26	   200ug/ml) of CHPV (Fig. 3B) or suramin (Fig. 3C), respectively. After 3 hour of
27	   infection, the infected cells were washed to remove the viruses and compounds and
28	   cultured with fresh medium. At 48 hrs post-infection, the supernatants were collected
29	   and the virus-produced Gluc activities were measured for monitoring the infection
30	   levels. Consistent with our previous observation [26], we did not detect any
31	   CHPV-induced toxic effect on the cells for 3hs exposure, nor for Suramin.
32	   Significantly,

both

CHPV

and
suramin
were
able
to
inhibit
virus infection. The half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) of CHPV was 30 ug/ml (Fig.3. B, left panel, while IC50 of
Suramin was about 40 ug/ml (Fig.3. B, right panel). The inhibitory effect of CHPV
and suramin on a SP mutant pseudotyped virus (SPΔCG614-PVs) infection was also
tested, and results show that SPΔCG614-PVs infection is also susceptible to CHPV
and suramin (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2-SPΔCG614 psedotyped GFP+
virus infection was tested in the presence of the two compounds and results showed
that the psedotyped GFP+ virus infection was efficiently inhibited by the presence of
CHPV and Suramin (Fig. 3D). All of these results demonstrate that both CHPV and
suramin exhibit strong inhibitory effect on both SPΔCD614-PVs and SPΔCG614-PVs
infection.

analyses of actions of CHPV and Suramin against
SARS-CoV2-SP-mediated virus entry
To gain more insight into the mechanism of how CHPV and Suramin are targeting
SARS-CoV-2 SP-PVs infection, each of the drugs (100 µg/ml) was added to 293TACE2
cells at various time points during the infection, as indicated in Figure 4. After 48 hrs
of infection, the supernatants were collected and measured for virus-expressed GLuc
activity. Results showed that a strong inhibitory effect was achieved when cells
were pretreated with CHPV or Suramin one hour before infection or when the
compounds were present simultaneously with SP-PVs (Fig. 4A and B). Interestingly,
even when drug was added at one hr post-infection, CHPV still exhibited nearly 70%
inhibition on SPΔCG614-PVs infection (Fig. 4A), while for Suramin, a lower inhibitory
effect (about 30% inhibition) was also observed (Fig. 4B). When CHPV or Suramin
was added to culture after 3 hrs of infection, no inhibitory activity on viral infection was
observed (Fig. 4A and B). These results suggest that both CHPV and suramin act on
the entry step of SPΔCG614-PVs infection.

16	  
17	   To further determine whether CHPV or suramin is targeting the interaction of
18	   SARS-CoV2-SP and its receptor, ACE2, , we used an in vitro SARS-CoV2-SP/ACE2
19	   binding ELISA assay, as described in Materials and Methods.
20	  
21	  
22	  
23	  
24	  

Additionally, an
anti-COVID-19 neutralizing antibody (SAD-S35) [38] was included in parallel.
Results revealed that the presence of either CHPV or suramin was able to specifically
target and significantly reduce the SARS-CoV2-SP-ACE2 interaction (Fig. 4C and D).
It should be noted that the neutralizing antibody (SAD-S35) also showed a strong
inhibition on SARS-CoV2-SP/ACE2 interaction (Fig. 4C and D).

25	  
26	   Combination of CHPV and anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (SAD-S35)
27	   mediated more potent blocking effect against SARS-CoV2-SP-PVs.
28	   As described above, both CHPV and Suramin can inhibit SARS-CoV2-SP/ACE2
29	   interaction and SP-PVs infection. We also tested whether the combination of two
30	   compounds could mediate a stronger anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Thus, we infected
31	   293TACE2 cells with SPΔCG614-PVs in the presence of a cocktail of CHPV/Suramin (25
32	   µg/mL per compound), or CHPV (50 µg/mL) or Suramin (50 µg/mL) alone. The results
33	   showed that in the presence of a cocktail of CHPV/Suramin, SPΔCG614-PVs was
34	   inhibited to 78%, while in the presence of CHPV or suramin alone, inhibition rate was
35	   65% or 40% (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that a combination of these two
36	   compounds may be able to achieve more efficient inhibition against SARS-CoV-2
37	   infection.
38	  
39	   The anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (SAD-S35) was also tested and showed
40	   a does-dependent neutralizing activity against SPΔCG614-PVs with an IC50 of 2.4
41	   µg/mL (Fig. 5B). Next, we sought to determine whether the combination of CHPV or
42	   Suramin with SAD-S35 could mediate a stronger anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Thus,
43	   serially diluted SAD-S35 (0.625 to 2.5 µg/ml) was mixed with CHPV (25 µg/mL) or
44	   Suramin (25 µg/mL) and added to the 293TACE2 cells with SPΔCG614-PVs

1	   simultaneously. In parallel, same concentrations of SAD-S35 alone were used for
2	   comparison.

The results show that 1.25 µg/ml of SAD-S35 alone only resulted in an

3	   approximately 25% decrease of infection. However, nearly 80% inhibitory effect was
4	   achieved when the same concentration of SAD-S35 was combined with CHPV
5	   (25µg/ml), or approximately 60% inhibitory effect was achieved when combined with
6	   suramin (25µg/ml), while CHPV or suramin alone only mediated 50% or 38%
7	   inhibition, respectively (Fig. 5C).
8	  
9	  
10	  
11	  

All together, the results clearly indicate that a
combination of CHPV or suramin with SAD-S35 is able to more potently block
SARS-CoV2 infection. By including a low dose of nAb, the amounts of CHPV or
Suramin needed to achieve highly effective inhibition of SARS-CoV2 infection can be
reduced.

12	  
13	   Inhibitory effect of CHPV and Suramin on SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.
14	   Given that both CHPV and suramin are able to block the SARS-CoV2-SP
15	   pseudovirus entry, we next tested whether these two drugs could block wild type
16	   SARS-CoV2 virus infection and virus-induced cytopathic effect in Vero cells. The wild
17	   type SARS-CoV-2 virus (hCoV- 19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020) was used to infect
18	   Vero cells in the presence of different concentrations of CHPV or Suramin. Briefly,
19	   Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 0.01) in the presence of different
20	   concentrations of CHPV or Suramin. After 72 hrs post-infection, as indicated (Fig. 6),
21	   the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effects in Vero cells were monitored. Results
22	   showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes dramatic cytopathic effect (CPE) in Vero
23	   cells after 72 hrs post-infection, with cells displaying 100% CPE.
24	  
25	  
26	  
27	  

Remarkably, in the
presence of CHPV or suramin (at 50 to 125 µg/ml), the SARS-CoV-2-induced
cytopathic effect (CPE) was significantly or completely inhibited in Vero cells. These
results provide strong evidence that the presence of CHPV or Suramin is able to
inhibit SARS-COV-2 infection.

study of SARS-COV-2 infection and the investigation of different
anti-SARS-COV-2 compounds required highly restricted BSL-3 containment. This
condition has significantly limited the SARS-COV-2-related research activities in
microbiology laboratories. In this study, we established a highly sensitive
SARS-COV-2-SP psedotyped HIV-based entry system, which encodes a Gaussia
luciferase (Gluc) gene as a reporter (Fig. 1B). Since Gluc can be secreted into the
supernatant after being expressed in the infected cells, it is very sensitive and
convenient for evaluating the level of SARS-CoV2-SP-mediated virus entry and may
be used for anti-SARS-CoV2-SP compound screening in a BSL-2 environment.

12	  
13	   Previous studies have revealed that the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of SARS SP contains a
14	   dibasic motif (KxHxx) that constitutes for an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrieval
15	   signal which retains the full-length SARS-S protein in the lumen of the ER-Golgi
16	   intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [39,40]. Deletion of 17 aa at the carboxyl-terminal
17	   in the CT of SARS SP was able to increase SP transported to the surface of cells and
18	   substantially

increased SARS SP-mediated cell-to-cell fusion [37]. In the
SARS-CoV2-SP, there is also a dibasic motif (KxHxx) present in the CT (Fg 1A). In
order to increase SARS-CoV2-SP incorporation into pseudovirions, we have deleted
17 aa at the CT of SARS-CoV2 SP and generated a SARS-CoV2 SPΔC expressor
plasmid (Fig. 1A, b). Indeed, our data showed that a significantly higher level of
SCoV2 SPΔC protein was present in the pseudovirus (Fig. 1C), and induced
remarkably efficient infection in 293TACE2 cells (Fig. 1D). This observation clearly
indicate that the dibasic motif in SARS-COV-2 SP is functional and a deletion of 17
amino acids substantially increased incorporation of SP into SARS-CoV2-SP-PVs
and enhance its infectivity. This information is also important for improving the design
of SARS-CoV2-SP-based vaccine strategies.

29	  
30	   Recent sequencing analyses found a SARS-CoV2 SP mutation, Aspartic acid (D)
31	   changed to Glycine (G) at aa position 614 in the S1 domain which was dominantly
32	   detected in April to May of 2020 isolates, indicating a transmission advantage over
33	   original SP D614 [15].
34	  
35	  
36	  
37	  

The following studies showed that SARS-CoV2G614 SP
mutant MLV pseudotyped viruses infected ACE2-expressing cells markedly more
efficiently than those with SARS-CoV2D614 [16,41]. Consistently, we also observed
the SARS-CoV2G614ΔC-pseudotyped lentiviral particles enhanced the pseudotyped
virus entry compared to the SPD614ΔC-PVs (Fig. 2E).

38	  
39	   By using this SCoV2-SP- pseudovirus system, we have provided evidence for the first
40	   time

that the CHPV can efficiently prevent infections mediated by both
SARS-CoV2-SPD614 and -SPG614 pseudovirus infection in 293TACE2 cells and
significantly block the infection of wildtype SARS-COV-2 in Vero cells. We also
revealed that CHPV blocks the entry of virus by directly interrupting the interaction of
SARS-CoV2-SP and ACE2 receptor by in vitro ELISA assay (Fig. 4 ). Interestingly,

1	   the presence of CHPV at one hour post-infection is still able to efficiently inhibit
2	   SARS-Cov2-SP pseudovirus infection (Fig. 4), suggesting that CHPV may not only
3	   target SP/ACE2 binding, but may also act on the following fusion step(s).
4

Overall,
our results provide convincing evidence for CHPV as a potential blocking agent
against SARS-COV-2 infection. In agreement with a recent study [33] that suramin
can inhibit SARS-COV-2 virus infection, we further provide evidence that suramin is
able to directly block SARS-CoV-2 SP-ACE2 interaction (Fig. 4D) and different
SARS-CoV-2 SP variants mediated virus entry (Fig 3, 4, and 5).

9	  
10	   Another interesting observation in this study is that the combination of CHPV or
11	   suramin with anti-SARS-COV-2 neutralizing antibody (nAb) could enhance their
12	   anti-SARS-COV-2 activity. The nAb has great potential to be used as a preventing
13	   agent in blocking SARS-COV-2 infection [42].
14	  
15	  
16	  
17	  
18

20	  

However, one disadvantage of using
nAb as an anti-SARS-COV-2 agent is its source limitation. Therefore, the finding of
the synergistic effect of a combination of nAb with other agents, such as CHPV or
Suramin is beneficial for (i) similar efficiencies would be achieved by using reduced
amounts of antibody and CHPV or Suramin, (ii) the combination of nAb and
CHPV/suramin will reduce the likelihood of viral resistance. Whether these enhanced
effects might be due to a combined effect through their different binding mechanisms
still needs to be investigated.

21	  
22	   The effectiveness of CHPV and/or suramin against SARS-COV-2 infection in vivo
23	   remains to be investigated. Our findings could be further validated in an appropriate
24	   animal model and clinical trials for prevention of COVID-19. Since SARS-COV-2
25	   infection initiates in the respiratory tract [43], the use of CHPV and/or Suramin as
26	   nasopharynx agents (Nasal spray) to prevent initial SARS-COV-2 infection and
27	   transmission in the respiratory tract will be a particularly attractive strategy, and will
28	   require further efficacy studies. Overall, we demonstrated that CHPV and suramin
29	   possess an anti-SARS-COV-2 entry inhibitor activity and functions at least partially by
30	   interrupting SARS-COV-2 SP binding to its receptor. Additional in vivo safety and
31	   protection studies will facilitate its application as an option to help control the ongoing
32	   SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

with SPΔCG614-PVs in presence of CHPV (50µg/ml) or suramin (50µg/ml) alone or a
mix of CHPV and suramin (each with 25µg/ml). After 3 hrs of infection, cells were
washed and add fresh medium for 48 hrs. Then the supernatants were collected and
Gluc activity in the supernatant was measured and present as % inhibition. B)
Inhibitory effect of nAb SAD-S35 on SPΔCG614-PVs infection. 293TACE2 cells were
infected with SPΔCG614-PVs in the presence of serially diluted SAD-S35 (1.25 to 10
µg/ml) for 3 hrs. Then infected cells were cultured in fresh medium. At 48 hrs pi., the
supernatants were collected and measured for Gluc activities and presented as %
inhibition. C) 293TACE2 cells were infected with SPΔCG614-PVs in the presence of
serially diluted SAD-S35 (0.625 to 2.5 µg/ml) alone or mixed with CHPV (25 µg/mL)
or Suramin (25 µg/mL) for 3 hrs and the infected cells were cultured in fresh medium.
At 48 hrs pi., the Gluc activities in the supernatants were measured and presented
as % inhibition. The results are the mean ± SD of duplicate samples, and the data are
representative of results obtained in two independent experiments.

6. Inhibitory effect of CHPV and Suramin on SARS-CoV-2
infection-induced cytopathic effects. Vero cells were infected with a wild type
SARS-CoV-2 virus (hCoV-19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020) in the presence or absence
of different concentrations of CHPV and Suramin. After 72 hrs pi., the SARS-CoV-2
infection-induced cytopathic effects in Vero cells were monitored. Error bars
represent variation between triplicate samples, and the data of (A) and (B) are
representative of results obtained in two independent experiments.
