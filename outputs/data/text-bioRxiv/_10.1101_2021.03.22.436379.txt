Abstract
Background and Purpose: Repurposing of currently available drugs is a valuable strategy to tackle the
consequences of COVID-19. Recently, several studies have investigated the effect of psychoactive drugs on
SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models as well as in clinical practice. Our aim was to expand these studies and
test some of these compounds against newly emerged variants.
Experimental Approach: Several antidepressant drugs and antipsychotic drugs with different primary
mechanisms of action were tested in ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing human embryonic kidney cells against the
infection by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-dependent pseudoviruses. Some of these compounds were also tested
in human lung epithelial cell line, Calu-1, against the first wave (B.1) lineage of SARS-CoV-2 and the variants
of concern, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351.
Key Results: Several clinically used antidepressants, including fluoxetine, citalopram, reboxetine,
imipramine, as well as antipsychotic compounds chlorpromazine, flupenthixol, and pimozide inhibited the
infection by pseudotyped viruses with minimal effects on cell viability. The antiviral action of several of these
drugs was verified in Calu-1 cells against the (B.1) lineage of SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, the anticonvulsant
carbamazepine, and novel antidepressants ketamine and its derivatives as well as MAO and phosphodiesterase
inhibitors phenelzine and rolipram, respectively, showed no activity in the pseudovirus model. Furthermore,
fluoxetine remained effective against pseudo viruses with N501Y, K417N, and E484K spike mutations, and
the VoC-1 (B.1.1.7) and VoC-2 (B.1.351) variants of SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusion and Implications: Our study confirms previous data and extends information on the repurposing
of these drugs to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection including different variants of concern.

Introduction
Coronaviruses, members of the enveloped RNA virus family Coronaviridae (Lai & Cavanagh, 1997), are
known to infect multiple species ranging from birds to mammals (To et al., 2013). In humans, in addition to
four coronaviruses causing common colds, high level of pathogenicity of viruses from this family, such as
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV), were observed in epidemics that emerged in 2003 and 2012, respectively (Q. Tang
et al., 2015). The pandemic that started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection,
and the dramatic increase in the number of infected people and death due to COVID-19, has shifted the efforts
of scientists towards investigating this virus more closely (F. Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Autopsies of
patients who died from COVID-19 have reported the spread of virus to lungs, kidneys, liver, heart, brain, and
blood (Puelles et al., 2020). Taken together, severity of cases and high infectivity of the virus requires more
attention and effort towards controlling the global epidemic and developing treatment options.
The spike protein (S protein) localized to the viral envelope has been annotated as one of the critical parts of
this group of viruses because of its role in attachment and fusion to host target cells (F. Li et al., 2005).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) located on the surface of the target cells is recognized by S protein
of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, Schroeder, et al., 2020; W. Li et al., 2003; Walls
et al., 2020; Q. Wang et al., 2020). A distinct location, the receptor-binding domain (RBD), in S protein is
important for binding to ACE2 (F. Li et al., 2005; Wan et al., 2020). ACE2-binding alone may allow the viral
entry to target cells, however, proteolytic processing of S protein by transmembrane protease/serine subfamily
member 2 (TMPRSS2) has been shown to enhance viral entry (Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, Schroeder, et al.,
2020; Shulla et al., 2011). Recent data on SARS-CoV-2 also suggests that the S protein cleavage by furin
proprotein convertase (Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, & Pöhlmann, 2020; Johnson et al., 2021) and binding of the
C-end of the S1 to the cellular receptor neuropilin-1 can also augment infectivity of this virus (CantutiCastelvetri et al., 2020; Daly et al., 2020). Lysosomal enzyme Cathepsin L has been shown to regulate priming
of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in order to provide entry of viral RNA genome into the host cytoplasm (Ou et al.,
2020). Although many key players facilitating viral entry and the routes of infection have been identified since
the emergence of COVID-19, effective drugs that can alleviate or eliminate the viral infection remain to be
found.
Recently, a number of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoCs) have been identified including VoC-1 (B.1.1.7
lineage) first identified in the UK (Preliminary Genomic Characterisation of an Emergent SARS-CoV-2
Lineage in the UK Defined by a Novel Set of Spike Mutations - SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus / NCoV-2019
Genomic Epidemiology, 2020), VoC-2 first identified in South Africa (B.1.351 lineage) (Tegally et al., 2020),
and the VoC-3 originating in Brazil (B.1.1.28 lineage and the descendent P1 lineage) (Genomic
Characterisation of an Emergent SARS-CoV-2 Lineage in Manaus, 2021; Phylogenetic Relationship of SARSCoV-2 Sequences from Amazonas with Emerging Brazilian Variants Harboring Mutations E484K and N501Y
in the Spike Protein - SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus / NCoV-2019 Genomic Epidemiology, 2021; Voloch et al.,
2020). Critical mutations in the RBD of S protein have been detected in these variants which can affect the
ACE2 affinity (associated with N501Y shared by all three VoCs) and antibody neutralization (associated with
E484K shared by VoC-2 and 3 and present in some strains of VoC-1) (Genomic Characterisation of an
Emergent SARS-CoV-2 Lineage in Manaus, 2021; Greaney, Loes, et al., 2021; Greaney, Starr, et al., 2021; Gu
et al., 2020; Nelson et al., 2021; Starr et al., 2020; Tegally et al., 2020; Wibmer et al., 2021). The emergence
of particularly VoC-2 and 3 variants has put the currently available vaccines and vaccine candidates under
dispute (Fontanet et al., 2021).
The strategy of drug repurposing has been used as a method of searching novel treatments for virus-related
diseases (Dyall et al., 2014; Mercorelli et al., 2018). A pre-clinical study has shown that the antidepressant
drugs, such as sertraline, paroxetine, and clomipramine, can reduce the Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV) entry to

target cells (Johansen et al., 2015). In line with this, the treatment of COVID-19 patients with fluoxetine,
escitalopram, and venlafaxine for 20 days has been found to reduce risk of intubation or death by COVID-19
(Hoertel et al., 2021). Another study has shown that the treatment of COVID-19 patients with fluvoxamine for
2 weeks was effective to decrease the development of clinical deterioration (Lenze et al., 2020).
In the present study, we addressed if the psychoactive drugs can be used to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection of
host cells in vitro. We show that pharmacologically diverse antidepressant drugs, as well as several
antipsychotics were able to reduce the infection by pseudotyped viruses harboring SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
Treatment of human lung epithelial cell line Calu-1 infected with the B.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2 with these
drugs was also successful in reducing the amount of infectious virus. Moreover, infection by pseudotyped
viruses carrying N501Y, K417N, or E484K single point mutations or triple mutant (N501Y/K417N/E484K)
in the spike protein was shown to be reduced by fluoxetine. Fluoxetine was also effective against the variants
of SARS-CoV-2, VoC-1 (B.1.1.7) and VoC-2 (B.1.351), in Calu-1 cells.

Cell lines
TMPRSS2 (NM_001135099.1) and ACE2 (AB046569.1) cDNAs were sequentially transfected into
HEK293T cells using lentiviral vectors. The positive colonies were selected by blasticidin or puromycin
resistance for TMPRSS2 and ACE2, respectively. The viral vectors were generated by transfecting HEK293T
cells using polyethylenimine with the packaging vector pCMV-dR8.91 and the vesicular stomatitis virus
(VSV-G) envelope expression vector pMD2.G (#12259, Addgene) with either pLenti6.3/V5-DESTTMPRSS2 (from UH Biomedicum Functional Genomic Unit) or pWPI-puro [modified from, #12254,
Addgene, (Z. Zhao et al., 2019)] expressing ACE2 (cDNA from Dr. Markku Varjosalo). Six hours after
transfection, media was replaced with fresh Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing high
glucose (Sigma–Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Culture supernatant was collected 2
days after transfection and passed through a 0.22-micron filter. The supernatant containing TMPRSS2
lentivector was added to human embryonic kidney cells, HEK293T, seeded on 6-well plates. Following 2 days
of selection with 15 µg/ml of blasticidin (Invitrogen), the cells were incubated with the medium containing the
ACE2 lentivector, and supplemented with 3 µg/ml puromycin (Sigma–Aldrich). After selection with
puromycin, single cell lines were established by serial dilution. Both the double-transduced pool and the cloned
cell lines were analyzed with SDS-PAGE using an anti-V5 antibody (#MA5-15253, Invitrogen) for TMPRSS2
and an anti-ACE2-antibody (#15983, Cell Signaling Technology).
HEK293T and HEK293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS,
2% L-Glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Human lung epithelial cell line Calu-1was kept in Roswell
Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% L-Glutamine, and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. Another human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3 and human colorectal adenocarcinoma
cell line Caco-2 were kept in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM) supplemented with 20% FCS, 1% LGlutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% MEM Non-essential Amino acid Solution (100X). VeroE6TMPRSS2 cells (ATCC® CRL-1586) were maintained in MEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% LGlutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All the cell lines were incubated at 5% CO2 and 37°C.
We addressed the expression level of ACE2, TMPRSS2, FURIN and GAPDH with qPCR in all the cell lines
(Fig. S1) by using human specific primers (Table S1).
Production of luciferase-encoding lentiviral vector pseudotyped with WT and mutant SARS-CoV-2 Sglycoprotein, and VSV-glycoprotein
HEK293T cells grown in T175 flask were transfected by using TransIT-2020 reagent (Mirus Bio) with
p8.9NDSB (Berthoux et al., 2004), pWPI-puro expressing Renilla luciferase, pEBB-GFP, and pCAGGS, an
expression vector containing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein cDNA of the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain
(NC_045512.2). The last 18 codons of spike glycoprotein were deleted to enhance the plasma membrane
transport. Pseudotyped viruses harbouring the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) were
produced following the same protocol by using VSV-G envelope expression vector pMD2.G (#12259,
Addgene). The culture media was replaced 12-16 h after transfection with fresh DMEM High Glucose (Sigma–
Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS. The supernatant containing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein- or
VSV-G-harboring pseudoviruses was collected 48 h after transfection, and passed through a 0.22-micron filter.
Mutations in RBD regions were generated by synthetic DNA (Integrated DNA Technologies) using PvuII and
HpaI restriction sites. Lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with mutant spikes were produced by following a similar
protocol as the wild type particles with minor changes. Instead of pWPI-puro expressing Renilla luciferase,
pWPI plasmid carrying both GFP and Renilla luciferase were used to eliminate the use of pEBB-GFP plasmid.

Detection of viral infection by pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 or VSV-G viruses and native SARS-CoV-2
For the experiments with pseudotyped viruses, HEK293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were cultured in poly-Llysine coated 96-well plates (ViewPlate 96, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Next day, the cells received varying
concentrations of listed drugs (Table 1) and pseudotyped lentiviruses harboring S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 or
glycoprotein of VSV. Following 24 h incubation with drugs and viral particles, cells were washed once with
PBS. After cells were lysed for 15 min at RT, Renilla luciferase reporter was used to measure viral entry. For
this purpose, luciferase activity was measured with a plate reader employing dispenser feature (Varioskan
Flash, ThermoFisher Scientific) after substrate addition to each well (Renilla Luciferase Assay System, E2820,
Promega or Coelenterazine native, cat#303, Nanolight Technology). In order to measure background signal,
uninfected cells and empty wells were included into the assay plate.
All work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus was conducted in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) Laboratory of UH
at Haartman Institute. SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates (wild type, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351), obtained from
nasopharyngeal swabs of patients (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020; Virtanen et al., 2021) (MOI 0.05), were
incubated with Calu-1 cells in 48-well plates (40.000 cells/well) for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO2, after which virus
inoculum was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS. The compounds were added to the cells in
duplicates, diluted in virus growth medium (VGM) (RPMI-1640 supplemented with 2% FCS, L-glutamine,
penicillin and streptomycin), 0.1% DMSO in VGM was used as control. Samples of the supernatant were
collected at 1 h, 24 h and 48 h post infection for qRT-PCR and at 24 h and 48 h for the TCID50 assay. Viral
RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany), and SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR was performed
using primers, probe and an in vitro synthesized control for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as
described earlier (Corman et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2021). Infectious virus titers were determined by TCID50
measurement of VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells (Virtanen et al., 2021). Shortly, 10-fold dilutions of the samples were
inoculated to VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells, incubated for 5 days, fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 30 min RT and
stained with crystal violet.
A flow chart was prepared to summarize the timeline of experiments regarding the pseudotyped viruses and
the native virus (Fig. 1).
Cell viability assay
Cell culturing, treatment, and infection protocols were followed as described for HEK293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2
and Calu-1 cells (Fig. 1). At the end of 24 h or 48 h period, cells were washed once with PBS and their viability
was measured with a kit designed to quantify ATP level according to instructions of the manufacturer
(CellTiterGlo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, Promega).
Data and statistical analysis
Pseudotyped viruses: The number of samples per treatment group was determined based on our earlier studies
(Casarotto et al., 2021; Fred et al., 2019). Each n represents an independent value. Data were normalized with
control groups to avoid unwanted sources of variation, pooled together, and analyzed in GraphPad Prism 6.0
software. Pseudotyped virus experiments were analyzed by unpaired t-test or one-way analysis of variance (or
their nonparametric equivalents) followed by Dunnett or Dunn’s post hoc tests, when appropriate. The
luciferase activity readings from pseudotyped viruses (SARS-CoV-2 and VSV-G) were replotted together to
run a comparative analysis. We compared the drug effect on the infection by SARS-CoV-2 spike and VSV-G
pseudotyped viruses by two-way analysis of variance followed by Sidak’s multiple comparison test. The
mutant pseudotyped virus experiments (infection) were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance followed by
Sidak's multiple comparison. IC50 values were calculated in GraphPad Prism software by using the non-linear
curve fitting of the data with log(inhibitor) vs. response-Variable slope function after conversion of drug
concentrations to logarithmic scale.

Native SARS-CoV-2 viruses: Due to limited resources for BSL-3 work with the native virus, experiments
with SARS-CoV-2 was conducted only once with relatively smaller n. Experiments using native virus were
analyzed by two-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett or Sidak post hoc test in GraphPad Prism 6.0
or by multiple two-way analysis of variance test in JASP (0.14.1). The control group of some samples were
the same, as they were tested in the same plate. Therefore, the same control group was represented in different
plots. The plots representing changes in the genome copy number were plotted in linear scale, whereas TCID50
values were represented in log10 scale in GraphPad Prism.
For all the experiments, values of p< 0.05 were considered significant. Presence of any outliers was calculated
by using Grubb’s test on GraphPad Prism website (https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/grubbs1), and
excluded from the analysis.
Statistical analysis were provided in Table S2 for the corresponding figures.

Results
HEK293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cell line is responsive to camostat mesylate
Camostat mesylate, a clinically tested serine protease inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit the activity of
TMPRSS2 and reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell lines expressing TMPRSS2 (Hoffmann, HofmannWinkler, Smith, et al., 2020; Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, Schroeder, et al., 2020; Kawase et al., 2012). In order
to confirm the activity of TMPRSS2 in the HEK293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cell line, we treated the cells with
different doses of camostat mesylate for 24 h and measured the level of viral infection. The infection of
HEK293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cell line by the pseudotyped lentiviruses was significantly reduced suggesting
that that these cells express TMPRSS2 and the activity of this protease is blocked by camostat mesylate (Fig.
S2).
Antidepressant drugs show antiviral activity against pseudotyped viruses and the first wave (B.1) lineage
of SARS-CoV-2
HEK293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were treated with a mixture of pseudotyped viral particles and one of the
following antidepressants: fluoxetine, citalopram, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, venlafaxine, reboxetine,
clomipramine, imipramine, or desipramine (Table 1) for 24 h. We found that all the drugs significantly reduced
the viral infection, as measured by luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 2). According to the cell viability assay
where ATP level was measured in infected HEK293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells, all the tested compounds,
except venlafaxine (Fig. 2e) and reboxetine (Fig. 2f), were slightly toxic at higher concentrations (Fig. 2).

SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-1 cells were treated with fluoxetine, reboxetine, clomipramine, imipramine,
citalopram or venlafaxine up to 48 h at concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 µM. The base level of viral RNA that
was measured 1 h after drug treatment revealed no significant changes between control and treatment groups
(Fig. 3). None of the compounds significantly changed viral replication or the amount of infectious virus after
24 h of treatment (Fig. 3). On the other hand, fluoxetine (Fig. 3a,b), reboxetine (Fig. 3c,d), clomipramine (Fig.
3e,f), and imipramine (Fig. 3g,h) were effective after 48 h to reduce the genome copies of SARS-CoV-2 and
TCID50. However, citalopram (Fig. 3i,j) and venlafaxine (Fig. 3k,l) were ineffective on reducing viral
replication and infectious particles of native SARS-CoV-2. Viability of Calu-1 cells was also measured in
mock and infected cells after 48 h treatment with these compounds (Fig. S3). Fluoxetine and clomipramine
reduced viability in Calu-1 cells (Fig. S3a,e). Other compounds, such as venlafaxine, did not have any
significant effect on the viability of Calu-1 cells (Fig. S3c), although some differences were observed in mock
vs. infected groups of citalopram and imipramine treated cells (Fig. S3b,f).

Antipsychotics can decrease the viral infection
The antiviral activity of antipsychotics chlorpromazine, flupenthixol, and pimozide were tested in HEK293TACE2-TMPRSS2 cells against pseudotyped viruses harboring SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Table 1).

Following 24 h incubation, all of these compounds were able to prevent viral infection, although we also
observed slight reduction of cell viability (Fig. 4).
Chlorpromazine (1, 2.5, and 5 µM) was also tested in SARS-CoV-2 (B.1 lineage) infected Calu-1 cells.
Treatment for 48 h with all the tested concentrations of chlorpromazine were able to induce a significant
reduction of total virus (Fig. 4d). In line with this, we observed diminished amount of infectious virus after 48
h treatment (Fig. 4e). No change in the viability of Calu-1 cells was observed in mock and infected cells after
48 h treatment with chlorpromazine (Fig. S3g).

Some psychoactive drugs fail to prevent the infection by the pseudotyped viruses
We next tested whether ketamine and ketamine metabolites (2S,6S-HNK and 2R,6R-HNK) which have
received attention during recent years because of their potential as rapid-acting antidepressant drugs (Abdallah
et al., 2015; Zanos et al., 2018) might also inhibit infection by the pseudotyped virus. We found that neither
ketamine nor the metabolites (Table 1) were effective reducing the viral infection within 24 h of incubation
period (Fig. 5a-c). Furthermore, other classical antidepressant drugs, phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor rolipram
and monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine (Table 1) also failed to prevent the viral entry (Fig. 5d,e). We
also tested carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant, which is also used as mood stabilizer for the treatment of bipolar
disorder (Mitchell & Malhi, 2002). This compound also failed to change the viral infection in
ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing HEK cells after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 4f).

Some of the tested drugs show SARS-CoV-2 spike specificity
We used pseudotyped viruses harboring glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) to address the
specificity and potential viral-entry independent effects of tested compounds. HEK293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2
cells were treated with a mixture of VSV-G pseudotyped viruses and drugs including fluoxetine, citalopram,
paroxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, clomipramine, desipramine, chlorpromazine, flupenthixol, or pimozide
for 24 h. Viral infection was quantified by measuring the luciferase activity (Figs. S4 and S5). While fluoxetine
(Fig. S4a), clomipramine (Fig. S4c), chlorpromazine (Fig. S4e), flupenthixol (Fig. S4g), pimozide (Fig. S4i),
and reboxetine (Fig. S4k) reduced the infection by the VSV-G pseudotyped viruses; citalopram (Fig. S5a),
desipramine (Fig. S5c), paroxetine (Fig. S5e), and fluvoxamine (Fig. S5g) remained ineffective. Slight
reduction of cell viability was observed in infected HEK293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells after fluoxetine,
clomipramine, chlorpromazine, pimozide, and reboxetine treatment (Fig. S4), while flupenthixol, citalopram,
desipramine, paroxetine, or fluvoxamine did not exert a toxic effect (Fig. S4 and Fig. S5).
We compared the effectiveness of the tested antidepressants and antipsychotics against SARS-CoV-2 spikeand VSV-G-pseudotyped viruses. We compiled the data from these viruses, and found higher effectiveness of
drugs in reducing the luciferase activity in SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses compared to VSV-G (Fig. S4b,d,f,h,j,l
and S5b,d,f,h).
Fluoxetine remains effective against pseudotyped viruses harboring the S protein RBD mutations and
native variants VoC-1 (B.1.1.7) and VoC-2 (B.1.351)
Next, we addressed the effectiveness of fluoxetine against the pseudotyped viruses carrying mutations in the
S protein that have been observed in some of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants (Preliminary Genomic

treatment for 24 h was effective against pseudotyped viruses carrying single point mutations in their S protein

mutations (N501Y/K417N/E484K) (Fig. 6c). Calu-1 cells which were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (B.1), VoC1 (B.1.1.7) or VoC-2 (B.1.351) variants, and challenged with fluoxetine (10 µM) showed reduced amount of
genome copies (Fig. 6d,e,f) and infectious virus (Fig. 6g,h,i). No difference was observed in the viability of
Calu-1 cells infected with these variants and treated with fluoxetine for 48 h (Fig. S3h).

Discussion
In the present study, we identified the potential of some widely consumed antidepressant and antipsychotic
drugs against the infection by SARS-CoV-2 (B.1) and the variants VoC-1 (B.1.1.7) and VoC-2 (B.1.351). The
experiments using pseudotyped viruses to infect HEK293T cells overexpressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were
aimed at identifying the direct effect of drugs on the entry phase of the viral infection, as we added the virus
and drugs around the same time. The outcome measure by luciferase assay was a direct indication of the
number of infected cells, due to replication-deficient nature of pseudotyped viruses. Drug concentrations

required for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection are within the range of steady-state plasma concentrations
assayed for these drugs (Bolo, 2000; Burke & Preskorn, 1999) indicating that the effects described here could
be clinically meaningful.
By testing pseudotyped viruses harboring the VSV-G, we found that some compounds including fluoxetine,
clomipramine, chlorpromazine, flupenthixol, pimozide, and reboxetine, counteract the infection in HEK-ACETMPRSS2 cells suggesting that these drugs are not specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In fact, it is not a
surprising that these compounds are effective against the entry of other viruses, as this has been reported in
studies testing clomipramine and flupenthixol against Ebola virus (Johansen et al., 2015). We observed that
the tested compounds induce more dramatic effect on the entry of viruses pseudotyped with the spike protein
of SARS-CoV-2 when compared to the ones harbouring the VSV glycoprotein. This speaks against the
possibility that these drugs act at the level of luciferase transcription, as the impact they induce differs between
pseudotyped viruses harbouring distinct viral entry proteins. Another interesting finding is that some drugs,
such as, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, desipramine, and citalopram did not exert any effect on the infection by
VSV-G particles suggesting the SARS-CoV-2 spike specificity of these compounds.
In experiments with human respiratory/lung epithelial cells and native virus, Calu-1 cells were first exposed
to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which was followed by removal of this inoculum and addition of drugs to be tested.
In this scenario, drugs do not necessarily interfere with the initial infection of cells by the virus, which was at
low multiplicity of infection (MOI 0.05) but with viral particle production and infection of the neighboring
cells. The decrease in viral replication that we observed after treating the cells for 48 h with the tested drugs
and the reduction of TCID50 as a secondary outcome could be caused by 1) the blockade of virus entry during
the subsequent waves of Calu-1 cell infection; 2) a direct effect on the mechanisms of viral replication,
packaging and release of new viral particles; 3) an indirect effect through the regulation of innate immunity;
or 4) a combination of the above effects. The first alternative, that the drugs interfere with viral infection of
Calu-1 cells later on when the cells release newly packed viruses to medium thereby explaining the decline of
viral genome copies and TCID50, would also be compatible with our findings with the pseudotyped virus.
Recently, a number of studies presented evidence supporting the effects of antidepressant drugs and related
psychoactive drugs as antiviral compounds against SARS-CoV-2 (Carpinteiro et al., 2020; Drayman et al.,
2020; Hoertel et al., 2021; Lenze et al., 2020; M. Plaze et al., 2020; Marion Plaze et al., 2020; Schloer et al.,
2020; Yang et al., 2020; Zimniak et al., 2021). One of these studies addressing SSRIs for their antiviral activity
did not show any effect of escitalopram and paroxetine, while fluoxetine was successful with inducing antiviral
activity after 3 days of treatment (Zimniak et al., 2021). Although this evidence supports our conclusion on
the fluoxetine effect, paroxetine data remains controversial. We have also observed that citalopram
significantly reduced the viral infection in HEK cells, while it remained ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 in
Calu-1 cells. This piece of evidence suggests that HEK cells challenged with pseudotyped viruses and Calu-1
cells exposed to SARS-CoV-2 may recruit different machineries that the drugs can act on, which may explain
this inconsistent data on the citalopram effect.
In another study, addressing the antiviral activity of fluoxetine, the same conclusion as ours suggested antiviral
properties of this compound (Schloer et al., 2020). The authors have also described cholesterol-trapping and
luminal pH altering effect of fluoxetine in endolysosomal compartments, which in the long term impairs the
release of viral genetic material into the cytosol of target cells from endosomes (Schloer et al., 2020). The
infection by SARS-CoV-2 activates acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) enzyme, leading to cell surface
accumulation of ceramide, which in turn could facilitate the infection. However, the ASM activity can be
inhibited by amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and maprotiline,
which reduced the infection by SARS-CoV-2 (Carpinteiro et al., 2020). Collectively, the data suggest that
psychoactive drugs that have been categorized as functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase activity
(FIASMA) (Kornhuber et al., 2010, 2011) can significantly reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection (Carpinteiro et

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.22.436379; this version posted March 23, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

al., 2020; Schloer et al., 2020). Most of the compounds we tested in the present study showed antiviral activity,
and a number of them are considered FIASMAs. On the other hand, we have found that the non-FIASMA
compounds venlafaxine and reboxetine (Kornhuber et al., 2011) also demonstrate antiviral activity. Moreover,
citalopram, one of the compounds that was found to reduce the ASM activity, albeit at weaker level (Kornhuber
et al., 2008), remains ineffective against native SARS-CoV-2 virus as shown by the present study and by
others (Zimniak et al., 2021). Therefore, inhibition of ASM by these drugs can only partially explain the role
of psychoactive drugs for the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
A recent study reported that the prevalence of COVID-19 was higher in health care professionals compared to
patients in psychiatric ward of a hospital in Paris, which prompted the authors to suggest that the consumption
of chlorpromazine protects against COVID-19 (M. Plaze et al., 2020; Marion Plaze et al., 2020). In a followup study, chlorpromazine was shown to exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection after 2 days
of treatment of monkey and human cell lines which is in line with the clinical observation (Marion Plaze et al.,
2020). Earlier studies on chlorpromazine have also demonstrated the antiviral activity of this compound against
other coronaviruses (Cong et al., 2018; Dyall et al., 2014; Wilde et al., 2014). The action of chlorpromazine
has been linked to inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis which is possibly effective for the blockade of
viral entry to target cells (Inoue et al., 2007; L. H. Wang et al., 1993; Weston et al., 2020). Although we did
not address the mechanism of action, our data on the effect of chlorpromazine on HEK cells and Calu-1 cells
are in agreement with these earlier studies. Other antipsychotics, flupenthixol and pimozide, identified as
inhibitors of pseudotyped viral infection of HEK cells in our study, have also been confirmed by others as
antiviral agents (Drayman et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Pimozide, tested by computational docking analysis
and in vitro assays, has been suggested to inhibit main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (MPro) (Vatansever et al.,
2020).
One of the challenges of drug repurposing is to find compounds that would achieve antiviral activity at safe
concentrations for human use. Supporting our in vitro findings, Hoertel and colleagues administered different
classes of antidepressants to 460 COVID-19 patients after admission to hospital. Administration of these drugs,
particularly fluoxetine, escitalopram, paroxetine, and venlafaxine at an average of 20 days with fluoxetineequivalent dose of 21.6 mg was associated with decreased risk of intubation or death by COVID-19 (Hoertel
et al., 2021). Moreover, treatment of outpatients with a positive COVID-19 test with the SSRI fluvoxamine
for 2 weeks was effective in reducing the development of clinical deterioration compared to the placebo group
(Lenze et al., 2020). Despite not addressing it directly, the authors suggest that the antiviral activity of
fluvoxamine might be due to the Sigma-1 receptor (S1R) agonism by this compound, as the activation of this
receptor is known to regulate cytokine production (Lenze et al., 2020). Not only fluvoxamine, but also many
other psychoactive drugs bind to S1R, including sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram, imipramine, paroxetine, and
desipramine (Narita et al., 1996). However, venlafaxine, one of the compounds that showed antiviral activity
in our study in HEK cells, has a very weak affinity to this chaperone (Ishima et al., 2014). Moreover, ketamine
can bind to both S1R and S2R (Robson et al., 2012), but this drug was ineffective as an antiviral reagent in the
present study. Therefore, S1R agonism and the regulation of cytokine levels through this chaperon does not
appear to fully explain how these drugs act as antiviral reagents.
One aspect that requires special attention is the cell type used in drug screening assays. Hoffmann and
colleagues have shown that one of the most debated drugs recently, chloroquine, fails to inhibit SARS-CoV-2
infection of Vero cells expressing TMPRSS2 while lack of TMPRSS2 makes this drug effective as antiviral
reagent (Hoffmann, Mösbauer, Hofmann-Winkler, et al., 2020). This finding suggests that the presence of
certain proteins associated with viral entry, such as TMPRSS2, can render a drug effective or ineffective, and
are required to maintain wild type nature of the infecting viral strains (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020).
Therefore, it is important to implement cell lines that are phenotypically close to human respiratory epithelial
cells to drug repurposing studies and validate the findings by different methodologies in order to increase the

translational value (Hoffmann, Mösbauer, Hofmann-Winkler, et al., 2020). In the present study, we
manipulated regular HEK293T cells to stably express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, initially identified targets that are
important for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, Schroeder, et al., 2020), and infection with
the native SARS-CoV-2 virus was tested in a relevant human lung cell line, Calu-1, infected with wild-type
low-passage viral strains (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020).
Emergence of the novel variants have raised a concern on the effectiveness of currently available SARS-CoV2 vaccines for the neutralization of these variants (Callaway, 2021; Callaway & Ledford, 2021; Fontanet et al.,
2021). Recent in vitro studies reported that some of these vaccines remain effective against the variants
carrying a set of mutations (Muik et al., 2021; K. Wu et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2021); however, others have
shown decreased effectiveness against these variants, particularly to those carrying the E484K mutation
(Callaway & Mallapaty, 2021; Collier et al., 2021; Wadman, 2020; P. Wang et al., 2021). Our present data
suggest that fluoxetine remains effective against the pseudotyped viruses harboring single mutations (N501Y,
K417N, E484K), or a triple mutation (N501Y/K417N/E484K) as present in VoCs 2 and 3. In line with this,
inhibitory effect of fluoxetine persists against the SARS-CoV-2 variants VoC-1 (B.1.1.7) and VoC-2
(B.1.351). Therefore, it is plausible to argue that antidepressants, as well as related-psychoactive compounds
can be considered as an alternative treatment method for people infected with these variants of SARS-CoV-2.
Since the emergence of COVID-19, substantial progress has been made towards understanding the life cycle
of SARS-CoV-2 and particularly how this virus can enter target cells. Dissecting the viral entry routes provides
the opportunity to come up with alternative strategies for prevention and management of the viral infection.
Studies that are currently available on the antiviral action of antidepressant drugs focus on the effect of these
drugs at late entry (in cytoplasm of host cell) (Carpinteiro et al., 2020; Schloer et al., 2020; T. Tang et al.,
2020). However, the effect of these drugs at the early entry pathway level (at host plasma membrane level)
should also be addressed. Thermal shift assays followed by X-ray diffraction studies suggested specific sites
of interaction for drugs, such as imipramine, clomipramine, thioridazine, paroxetine, and sertraline, on EBOV
glycoprotein (Ren et al., 2018; Y. Zhao et al., 2018). Similar strategies can be followed to address whether
these drugs can bind to SARS-CoV-2 S protein directly. Altogether, our data together with other recent studies
suggest that safe and clinically available antidepressants drugs might become an additional tool for our fight
against the COVID-19 pandemia.
