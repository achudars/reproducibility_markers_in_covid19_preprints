Abstract
Clinical evidence suggests the central nervous system (CNS) is frequently impacted by
SARS-CoV-2 infection, either directly or indirectly, although mechanisms remain unclear.
Pericytes are perivascular cells within the brain that are proposed as SARS-CoV-2
infection points1. Here we show that pericyte-like cells (PLCs), when integrated into a
cortical organoid, are capable of infection with authentic SARS-CoV-2. Prior to infection,
PLCs elicited astrocytic maturation and production of basement membrane components,
features attributed to pericyte functions in vivo. While traditional cortical organoids
showed little evidence of infection, PLCs within cortical organoids served as viral
‘replication hubs’, with virus spreading to astrocytes and mediating inflammatory type I
interferon transcriptional responses. Therefore, PLC-containing cortical organoids
(PCCOs) represent a new ‘assembloid’ model2 that supports SARS-CoV-2 entry and
replication in neural tissue, and PCCOs serve as an experimental model for neural
infection.

Main
Initially thought of as primarily a respiratory infection, SARS-CoV-2 is now implicated in
substantial central nervous system (CNS) pathology3,4. CNS symptoms include ischemic
strokes, hemorrhages, seizures, encephalopathy, encephalitis-meningitis, anosmia, postinfectious syndromes, and neuro-vasculopathy, collectively described in up to 85% of ICU
patients5-8. Several reports appear to meet established criteria for infectious encephalitis9.
SARS-CoV-2 can utilize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor although
other receptors have been proposed10,11. Recent studies on single cell RNA-seq (sc-RNAseq) datasets indicate low levels of ACE2 expression in brain cells, however, expression
is relatively high in some neurovascular unit (NVU) components, particularly in brain
pericytes12-14. Autopsy series have suggested the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to spread
throughout the brain, especially within vascular and immune cells. They note ischaemic
brain lesions accompanied by widespread activation of astrocytes and cell death1,15. The
potential for a SARS-CoV-2 elicited neurovasculopathy supports the development of new
models to study tropism and pathology.
Brain pericytes are derived from neural crest stem cells (NCSCs), and are uniquely
positioned in the neurovascular unit (NVU), physically linking endothelial and astrocytic
cells16. Embedded within the basement membrane, pericytes connect, coordinate and
regulate signals from neighboring cells to generate responses critical for CNS function in
both healthy and disease states, including blood-brain barrier permeability,
neuroinflammation, neuronal differentiation, and neurogenesis in the adult brain17-19.
We found that GFP+ pericyte-like cells (PLCs) generated in vitro from human pluripotent
stem cell (hPSC)-derived NCSCs expressed the standard pericyte markers NG2 and
PDGFR-b (Fig. 1a-b)20. We detected appreciable ACE2 mRNA and protein in 2D cultured
PLCs compared with cultured human neural precursors (Extended Data Fig. 1a-d). To
assess SARS-CoV-2 PLC tropism, we exposed PLCs to authentic SARS-CoV-2 at MOI
0.5, then harvested supernatant and cells daily (Fig. 1c). We found that the percentage
of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (SNP)-positive cells and viral RNA as measured by qRTPCR increased daily up to 72 hours post infection (h.p.i.), from 0% to 65% SNP positive,
with viral RNA load increasing up to ~1000-fold (Fig. 1d-e). Plaque assay from
supernatants on Vero E6 cells showed ~100-fold increased infectious virus production at
24 h.p.i with increased virus particles as well as viral titers compared to baseline,
suggesting viral production by PLCs (Fig. 1f-g)21.
Demonstrating the infectability of PLCs led us to explore their effects on SARS-CoV-2
tropism within cortical brain organoids (COs). To this end, we developed an ‘assembloid’
in which GFP+ PLCs are integrated into mature COs. We thus generated PLC-containing
cortical organoids (PCCOs), by seeding 2x105 GFP+ PLCs into wells containing COs at
60div (days in vitro) (Fig. 2a). By 74div, using tissue clearing and light sheet microscopy,
we observed GFP+ cells integrating into COs as cell clusters, subsequently spreading
across the surface and penetrating into the CTIP2+ cortical plate-like zone in COs (Fig.
2b-c).

We found that PCCOs maintained similar structural architecture and cellular compositions
as traditional COs (Fig. 2d-f and Extended Data Fig. 2a-b). The GFP+ PLCs within PCCOs
show GFP mRNA expression and retained standard pericyte markers expression
(Extended Data Fig. 3a-b). However, we found that within PCCOs, PLCs attuned GFAPpositive astrocyte expression and morphology, which more closely resembled a
classically described ‘star’-shape with end-feet like structures seen in mature astrocytes
that were adjacent to PLCs (Fig. 2g)22,23. These results evidenced features of astrocytic
maturation compared to traditional COs24. Moreover, we detected laminin-b1 protein
adjacent to PLCs, suggesting accumulation of basement membrane (BM), which is
normally absent from traditional COs (Fig. 2h-i). Confocal imaging confirmed localization
of astrocytes and PLCs with laminin (Fig. 2j). Together, these results suggest PCCOs
recapitulate the structural architecture of PLCs-BM-astrocytes described within the
vertebral neurovascular unit (Fig. 2k)16.
We additionally characterized PCCOs by single cell RNA-seq (sc-RNA-seq). Compared
to COs, PCCOs showed an ~23% shift from progenitor to neuronal populations, which
was validated with TBR1 immunostaining (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 4a-d and
Supplementary Dataset 1)25-27. Tandem mass spectrometry using isobaric labeling of
PCCOs compared with COs supported these results, revealing that GFAP, TBR1, DCX,
and STMN2 formed an upregulated protein module, suggesting an effect of PLCs on
neuronal differentiation in PCCOs (Extended Data Fig. 5a-b, Supplementary Dataset 1).
We next exposed PCCOs to SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.5 for 72h (Fig. 3a). Compared with
traditional COs that showed scant neuroglial cells positive for the established viral SNP
protein as reported28,29, PCCOs showed a significantly higher proportion of SNP+ cells
(10% vs. 1% in PCCOs vs. COs, p <0.0001, t-test, Fig. 3b-f, Extended Data Fig. 6a-b,
Supplementary Dataset 2). qRT-PCR showed a corresponding ~50-fold increase in viral
RNA in exposed PCCOs over COs (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Dataset 2).
We then compared the cellular infection vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 in COs vs. PCCOs.
In COs, we found <1% NeuN+/SNP+ cells or GFAP+/SNP+ cells and no discernable effect
of viral exposure on CO characteristics (Extended Data Fig. 7a-e). In many ways, it
seemed that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 was innocuous to COs. In contrast, in PCCOs
we found the majority of SNP+ cells co-localized with GFP+ PLCs and surrounding GFAP+
astrocytes in virus-exposed PCCOs (Fig. 3e-e’ and h). Confocal imaging demonstrated
that astrocytes were not only adjacent to the infected PLCs but were themselves SNP+
(Fig. 3i). To transcriptionally profile cellular constituents, we performed sc-RNA-seq at
72h.p.i. We detected SARS-CoV-2 reads in ~2% of cells in PCCOs, overwhelmingly
confined to astrocytes, but not neurons (Fig. 3j-m). There were no detectable SARS-CoV2 reads in infected COs (Supplementary Dataset 1). These data suggest that infection of
astrocytes is mediated by the presence of the PLCs population.
Finally, to explore pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in PCCOs, we performed
immunostaining and observed a significant increase (~20%) in percent of cells evidencing
programmed cell death (cleaved caspase 3 and p53-positive) in infected PCCOs (Fig. 4ab, Supplementary Dataset 2). sc-RNA-seq indicated that the source of the cell death was

largely confined to astrocytes, consistent with the described selective vulnerability (Fig.
4c)30. Gene ontology (GO) term analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) specific
to astrocytes highlighted inflammatory and genotoxic stress activation (Fig. 4d). This
correlated with activation of type I interferon transcriptional response, and with
upregulation of IFIT1, IFI44, ISG15 in virus exposed compared to mock infected PCCOs
(Fig. 4e, Supplementary Dataset 3)31. Several type I interferons signaling cascade genes
(STAT1, STAT2) and an ISG15-effector gene (USP18) were also upregulated (Fig. 4f,
Supplementary Dataset 2)32. Increased expression of ISG15 was confirmed by qRT-PCR
in infected PCCOs (Fig. 4g). These results implicate astrocytic pathology in SARS-CoV2 inflammatory brain pathology, mediated through the type I interferon pathway.
Here we demonstrate that PLCs can be productively infected by SARS-CoV-2 and
through integration of PLCs into COs, we established a novel PCCO ‘assembloid’. Within
PCCOs, we found PLCs establish characteristics of PLCs-BM-astrocytes structure and
increase the cellular proportion of neuronal population, mimicking reported functions of
human brain pericytes in vivo. Upon exposure to SARS-CoV-2, we observed robust
infection within PCCOs and consequent induction of neuronal death and type I interferon
responses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PLCs can serve as viral ‘replication hubs’,
supporting the viral invasion and spread to other cell types, including astrocytes.
Although SARS-CoV-2 invasion into human CNS has been modeled in 3D brain
organoids, choroid plexus (ChP) organoids, and K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, evidence
suggests that most neural cells have little to no capacity for SARS-CoV-2 infection. On
the other hand, the presence of any cells expressing ACE2 or other receptors may be
sufficient to initiate infection28,29,33,34, motivating further work to understand the receptor
expression profile and impact on infection at the human NVU in vivo. Drawing on clinical
and experimental data supporting potential vascular entry and ACE2 expression in
pericytes, our PCCO SARS-CoV-2 infection model presents an alternative route to
infection. The PCCO model could be further improved by incorporating other NVUcomponent cell types, which might lend itself to other uses35. Our work provides a
powerful model to study SARS-CoV-2, and may be useful to model other infectious
diseases.

Methods
Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells, Neural Crest Stem Cells Culture, and
constructs
HEK293T cells (sex typed as female), Hela and H1 ESC (sex typed as male) were
obtained from ATCC (CRL-11268TM), ATCC (ATCCÒCCL-2TM) and WiCell (WAe001-A),
and were not further authenticated. Generation of neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) was
described previously20. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were from CIRM
(CIRM-IT1-06611). All cells were regularly mycoplasma negative. pLV-EF1a-EGFP-Puro
construct was obtained from Dr. Fred Gage’s lab as a gift. Lentiviral packaging plasmids
pMD2.G, pPAX2 were obtained from Addgene. pcDNA3.1-hACE2 plasmid was obtained
from Dr. Tom Rogers at Scripps as a gift.
Human cortical brain organoid (CO) and pericyte containing cortical organoid
(PCCO) culture
H1 and hiPSCs were maintained in mTeSR and passaged according to manufacturer’s
recommendations. Cortical brain organoids were generated as previously described36,37.
For PCCO generation, at CO 60 div, 2x105 GFP+ PLCs were integrated into each CO in
a low attachment 96-well plate. PLC integrated COs were maintained in PCCO media for
14 days (See Supplementary Note for details).
SARS-CoV-2 infection of pericyte-like cells, COs, and PCCOs and Plaque assay
All work with SARS-CoV-2 was conducted in Biosafety Level-3 conditions at the
University of California San Diego following the guidelines approved by the Institutional
Biosafety Committee. SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources) was
propagated and infectious units quantified by plaque assay using Vero E6 (ATCC) cells.
See the infection details in Supplementary Note.
Detection of viral mRNA and replication using RT-qPCR
For viral RNA quantification, PLCs, COs or PCCOs were washed twice with PBS and
lysed in TRIzol. RNA was extracted using the Qiagen-RNA extraction Kit. 2µg RNA was
used to generate cDNA with SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). 20ng
cDNA was used to perform qPCR with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix and the
CDC-N1/N2/N3-SARS-CoV-2 primers mix (IDT) at a final concentration of 100nM for
each primer using a Bio-Rad Real-Time PCR system. All the qPCR primers were listed
in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Datasets.
Immunostaining and Light Sheet Imaging of PCCO and CO
COs and PCCOs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 72h before removal from BSL3,
then embedded in 15%/15% gelatin/sucrose solution and sectioned at 20 µm. The
sections were then permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, blocked with 5% BSA and
incubated with primary antibodies in 5% BSA/0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS at standard
dilutions overnight at 4 °C. Next day, the sections were incubated with secondary
antibodies together with DAPI and mounted with Fluoromount-G®. All the images were
taken with ZEISS LSM880 Airyscan, with post-acquisition analysis done in ImageJ-6. For
light sheet, PCCOs were harvested for clearing in PBST in a 1.5ml EP tube (1PCCO/tube).
CUBIC 38 was used for clearing. Cleared PCCOs then embedded into 1% Agarose
solution for imaging. 5X lens was used for imaging with a light sheet microscope (Zeiss
Z1) according to manufacturer recommendations. The images were further developed
with IMARIS (Oxford Instruments).
CO/PCCO dissociation and Single cell library preparation and sequencing
COs and PCCOs were dissociated using AccuMax, dead cells were removed by Dead
Removal cocktail (Annexin V, STEMCELL Technology). Live cells were then used 10X

GEM generation. 10X sc-RNA-seq-3’-V3.1 kit (10X Genomics) was used to generate the
GEM, cDNA and library were generated according to the manufacturer’s instructions (10X
Genomics). Libraries was sequenced using the Novaseq6000 with PE150bp for 20M
reads were requested for each sample. See experimental details in Supplementary Note
CO/PCCO TMT4 quantitative Protein Mass Spectrometry
Three COs and three PCCOs were harvested into 1.5ml cold PBS, then centrifuged at
1500rpm at 4°C for 10min. After centrifugation, all PBS was removed and the CO/PCCO
samples were flash frozen in liquid N2. The frozen cell pellets were analyzed by TMT4
quantitative mass spectrometry at the UCSD Proteomics Core.
Data processing of single-cell RNA-seq and Mass Spectrometry
Single cell RNA-seq sequencing were demultiplexed into Fastq files using the Cell Ranger
(10x Genomics, 4.0) mkfastq function. Samples were then aligned to GRChg38-2020 10x
genome reference. The count matrix was generated using the count function with default
settings. SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) genome and GFP-CDS were written into
GRChg38-2020 human genome reference as a gene with mkref function in cell ranger
4.0. Seurat package (v.3.1.5) in RStudio (with R v. 3.5.3), used for the downstream
analysis. Features expressed in less than 5 cells, cells with less than 300 unique features,
or high mitochondrial content over 5% were discarded. scTransform function was used to
wrap the technical variation; FindIntergrationAnchors and IntegrateData functions were
used to integrate all libraries metrics into a single matrix. Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) together with the PCEIbowPlot function were used to determine the inflection point.
Clusters were determined using Runheatmap, FindNeighbors and Findclusters function
within Seurat. Cells were considered infected if they carried the transcripts aligned to
SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. Differentially expressed genes from the FindMarkers function
were used to perform DAVID-GO-Term analysis over representation tests for both upregulated and downregulated genes in each condition shown in Fig. 2r, Supplementary
Dataset 1-2.
Mass Spectrometry data were generated and analyzed by the proteomic core at UCSD
(Supplementary Dataset 1). Proteins with significance over 15 were used for GO-Term
and string analysis in goprofile (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost)and String (https://stringdb.org/) (Supplementary Dataset 1).
