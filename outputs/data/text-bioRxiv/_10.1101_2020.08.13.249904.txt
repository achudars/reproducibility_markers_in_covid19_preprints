Abstract
We are in unprecedented times with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has
impacted public health, the economy and our society on a global scale. In addition, the impacts
of COVID-19 permeate into our environment and wildlife as well. Here, we discuss the essential
role of wastewater treatment and management during these times. A consequence of poor
wastewater management is the discharge of untreated wastewater carrying infectious SARSCoV-2 into natural water systems that are home to marine mammals. Here, we predict the
susceptibility of marine mammal species using a modelling approach. We identified that many
species of whale, dolphin and seal, as well as otters, are predicted to be highly susceptible to
infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition, geo-mapping highlights how current
wastewater management in Alaska may lead to susceptible marine mammal populations being
exposed to the virus. Localities such as Cold Bay, Naknek, Dillingham and Palmer may require
additional treatment of their wastewater to prevent virus spillover through sewage. Since over
half of these susceptibility species are already at risk worldwide, the release of the virus via
untreated wastewater could have devastating consequences for their already declining
populations. For these reasons, we discuss approaches that can be taken by the public,
policymakers and wastewater treatment facilities to reduce the risk of virus spillover in our
natural water systems. Thus, we indicate the potential for reverse zoonotic transmission of
COVID-19 and its impact on marine wildlife; impacts that can be mitigated with appropriate
action to prevent further damage to these vulnerable populations.

1. Introduction
In many municipalities, sewage whether treated or untreated is the major effluent discharged into
rivers and oceans after agricultural run-off. Although the “seaward” design of sanitation systems
is ideal for our public health, the same is not true for ocean life. Marine mammals are vulnerable
to the influx of pharmaceuticals, personal care products, detergents and nanoparticles from
sewage. Another invisible threat carried in the sewage to marine life is the potential influx of
foreign microorganisms found in human excrement. During the current pandemic, the foreign
pathogen of interest is the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); a
virus that originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and is responsible for coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19)(Yang et al., 2020).
It is well-established that the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the respiratory system but recent
evidence indicates that the virus is responsible for multi-organ infection, including the intestinal
tract of patients, which results in gastroenteritis in one third of COVID-19 cases (Lamers et al.,
2020). The viral shedding in feces occurs irrespective of symptoms and age. A consequence of
its capacity to infect the human gut and the shedding is the presence of viable coronavirus in the
human waste of infected individuals, and thus a potential source of viral transmission (Fei Xiao
et al., 2020). Indeed, it has been show that COVID-19 patients shed infective SARS-CoV-2 in
stool and urine (Sun et al., 2020; Fei Xiao et al., 2020). The importance of this potential
mechanisms of transmission is further highlighted by the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has been
detected widely in the untreated domestic wastewater of many countries including Spain,
Australia, Italy and France (Ahmed et al., 2020; La Rosa et al., 2020; Randazzo et al., 2020).
Domestic wastewater is treated through primary, secondary and tertiary treatment stages.
Primary treatment involves the settling of settleable solids and is used alone or in conjunction

with subsequent secondary and tertiary treatment stages. As such, primary treatment alone is
predicted to poorly mitigate viral contamination. During secondary treatment, a biological
process is used to remove dissolved and suspended organic compounds. During tertiary
treatment, various processes are used to further reduce nutrient and pathogen concentrations.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be easily detected in treated wastewater effluent, and initial data
suggests that treatment stage does impact SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which in turn may serve as a
measure of viral load (Randazzo et al., 2020). For example, using primary sludge to detect initial
levels of SARS-CoV-2 in environmental systems, one study found that 83% (35 out of 45) of
primary samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 11% (2 out of 18) secondary treated
effluent samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, while none of the tertiary treated effluent
samples (0 out of 12) tested positive (Peccia et al., 2020). In adapting to the pandemic, there is a
need to identify wastewater treatment plants that are at relatively high risk of allowing effluent
carrying infective SARS-CoV-2 to “spillover” or “overflow” into natural systems, as we show in
our study. Thus, non-treated and primary-treated wastewater represents the highest risk effluent
for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in our sewage and efforts are being made to utilize
wastewater virus detection to manage responses to COVID-19 and potentially future pandemics.
For example, in Italy, SARS-CoV-2 was recently detected in untreated wastewater, and as such,
its survival in water and wastewater represents a significant form of transmission to consider (La
Rosa et al., 2020). Furthermore, in Paris it was shown that high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2
RNA in sewage water between March and April 2019 correlated with a spike in deaths from
COVID-19 approximately 7 days later, suggesting that the detection of virus in wastewater
represents a possible early warning system for COVID-19 and future viral pandemics (Wurtzer

et al., 2020). On June 16th, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the river water in
Ecuador (a country with poor sanitation), where the untreated sewage is delivered directly into
natural waters (Guerrero-Latorre et al., 2020). Although the situation in Ecuador is one example,
the challenges of managing direct sewage outfalls during the pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa
highlight the global calls to action of understand SARS CoV-2 in natural water systems (Street,
Malema, Mahlangeni, & Mathee, 2020).
The obvious question arises from these studies, does SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load
equate to infective virus and thus risk? Previously, it was shown that other related coronaviruses
are stable in wastewater and water from days to weeks (Casanova, Rutala, Weber, & Sobsey,
2009). A study found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is stable in a wide range of pH (3-10),
including water (A. W. H. Chin et al., 2020). However, how the SARS-CoV-2 virus fares in the
environment and the conditions influencing its stability in wastewater are still poorly understood.
Casanova et al., 2009 found that in lake water, another coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus
(MHV), was stable for longer than 2 weeks. Finally, modelling studies by Shutler and colleagues
that extrapolate infectivity from in vitro studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 viral particle may be
stable for up to ~25 days in warmer regions of the world (Shutler et al., 2020). The study also
predicted how differing environments around the world differ in relative risk of the virus in
wastewater discharge (Shutler et al., 2020).
The sewage carrying infectious particles ends up in our natural water systems either
directly discharged in some cases from inadequate treatment or from problematic sewage
overflow or pipe exfiltration. Thus, the absence or failure of a wastewater treatment plant can
lead to sewage being another form of transmission that affects both humans and susceptible
species. Communities that do not have a safe sanitation infrastructure in place will put many

individuals and susceptible species at risk. A recent preprint provided the first evidence of
SARS-CoV-2 transmission through sewage, which lead to the infection of multiple individuals in
a low-income community in Guangzhou, China (Yuan et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 was found in
street sewage puddles and pipes in the area. In a similar way, infectious particles from the
sewage ending up in our natural waters may lead to virus spillover for susceptible species.
Collectively, these studies indicate the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to be stable enough in
wastewater for raw sewage to be a contributor to virus transmission during the pandemic.
Historically, wastewater management in the context of infectious disease has been
confined to local infrastructures. Historically relevant waterborne infectious species such as
Escherichia coli, Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium spp. are assessed locally, and the
appropriate actions/treatments can be taken or utilized (Mayer & Palmer, 1996; Nasser, VaizelOhayon, Aharoni, & Revhun, 2012). However, in the case of an infectious virus with a global
reach being present in our wastewater, we are in a new paradigm. Like the virus, we must
continue to globally evolve wastewater management practices and risk assessment to protect not
only us but other organisms that are predicted to be susceptible to the virus. Infectious SARSCoV-2 virus has been isolated from both urine and fecal samples; new indicators that the virus is
being shed into sewage (Sun et al., 2020; F. Xiao et al., 2020). Consequently, it is possible that
marine mammal species that are found inland or nearshore of contaminated natural water
systems will be exposed to a novel pandemic virus. But what is the likelihood of such a scenario?
A potential spillover of a human pandemic-type virus to wild animals via reverse
zoonosis can have drastic consequences on their populations. A recent example occurred with the
Ebola pandemic where over 5000 gorillas were lost over the course of 2 years (2002 and 2003)
after a human strain of the virus was transmitted to a gorilla (Bermejo et al., 2006; Wolinsky,
6

2017). There is a need to prevent such spillover events from occurring to protect vulnerable
species around the world and that begins with assessing the possibility of it occurring for species
in proximity to humans. The transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from humans to other
vulnerable species in proximity to humans has already been observed. In a New York Public zoo,
a critically endangered tiger and several other animals (including lions) were infected with the
SARS-CoV-2 virus (Wang, Mitchell, et al., 2020). When the perpetrator virus was sequenced
from a sick Malayan tiger, it was revealed that it was two strains of human origin (i.e, two
separate human-feline transmission events) that had infected these feline species (McAloose et
al., 2020). Furthermore, there is now evidence that the virus can infect and be carried by certain
domesticated pets, including cats; felines that are closely related to tigers (Shi et al., 2020). We
recently described how ACE2 (the host receptor targeted by SARS-CoV-2) variability has
contributed to why certain species are susceptible and not others (Mathavarajah & Dellaire,
2020). We then used these differences to predict the susceptibility of other at-risk feline species
(Mathavarajah & Dellaire, 2020). In addition, a report utilizing a similar approach suggested that
only mammals were predicted to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and at risk (Damas et al.,
2020). In support of these analyses, chickens were recently found to not be susceptible to the
virus (Schlottau et al., 2020). Therefore, with the recent studies on wastewater and the presence
of infective SARS-CoV-2, it is increasingly likely that wildlife, and in particular mammals
exposed to waterways receiving wastewater effluent, will be exposed to this virus. As such,
additional public efforts to prevent spillover events will be beneficial for protecting susceptible
marine species during the current COVID-19 pandemic, particularly those species that are
threatened or endangered. Thus, it is important to identify which marine mammals are at risk of
contracting the virus. In addition, identifying localities with non-treated and primary-treated

wastewater effluent and their proximity to endangered marine mammal populations will be
important for risk-mitigation. In this article, we explore the susceptibility of marine mammal
species, the conservation risks associated with the anthropogenic transmission of the SARSCoV-2 virus to marine mammals around the world, and examine Alaskan wastewater
management practices as a case study for identifying localities with a potentially high risk of
virus spillover.
2. Methods
2.1 ACE2 variation in marine mammals
We performed a comprehensive analysis of the ACE2 receptor using annotated genomes of
marine mammals from the 4 major groups: Cetacea (whales and dolphins), Pinnepidia (seals),
Sirenia (sea cows), and Fissipedia (sea otters and polar bears). In total, we examined 36 marine
mammal species that encompassed all publicly available reference and scaffold genomes. We
compared the predicted ACE2 orthologs from these genomes to identify whether or not binding
residues (25 consensus residues) are mutated (Shang et al., 2020). The analysis extends previous
work by Damas et al., (2020) where they looked at the ACE2 receptor in 12 cetacean species.
Our goal with these analyses was to generate the most comprehensive index of susceptibility for
marine mammals to SARS-CoV-2 based on ACE2 gene conservation.
2.2. Assessing the susceptibility of species to SARS-CoV-2
After compiling the mutation data for comparisons between human ACE2 and the orthologous
ACE2 sequences, we utilized the MutaBind2 tool to model and predict whether these mutations
(i) improve or (ii) reduce SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to the receptor (Mihindukulasuriya, Wu,
St Leger, Nordhausen, & Wang, 2008; Zhang et al., 2020). The reference protein for the analysis
8

is the human ACE2 receptor. MutaBind2 models how protein-protein interactions are affected
from missense mutations in the protein sequence. The RBD binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2
virus spike protein interacts with the human ACE2 receptor to facilitate virus entry. For that
reason, we used the crystal structure of the Spike protein and ACE2 receptor as a template for the
modelling (PDB: 6M17) (Yan et al., 2020). If the ACE2 orthologs carry mutations that reduce
the binding affinity of the Spike protein to ACE2, then we predict susceptibility to be reduced.
To distinguish between the susceptible and non-susceptible species, we used the human
ACE2 (high susceptibility), feline ACE2 (medium susceptibility; lower affinity but still
susceptible) and dog ACE2 (not susceptible) as reference points to stratify groups in terms of
susceptibility based on ΔΔGbind (kcal mol-1) values. Here, ΔΔGbind describes the predicted
change in binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein induced by mutations in the ACE2
receptor. Susceptibility values based on ΔΔGbind were determined as follows: higher than
human ( <-0.1 kcal mol-1), high (resembles human ACE2; -0.1 to 0.1 kcal mol-1), medium
(resembles cat ACE2; 0.1 to 0.4 kcal mol-1), lowly (resembles dog ACE2; >0.4 kcal mol-1).
Negative values are stabilizing, and positive values are destabilizing mutations on the proteinprotein interaction. Although these are relative values, they allow us to compare susceptibilities
of species based on available data. The analysis thus allows the prediction of which species have
high or low susceptibility to virus entry via ACE2 and ultimately an estimate of the degree a
species is at-risk. These data and analyses are summarized in Supplemental Table 1.
2.3. Cross-referencing of conservation status and susceptibility
We cross-referenced the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red list of
Threatened Species (https://www.iucnredlist.org; accessed July 31, 2020) to better understand
which at risk species were also susceptible to the virus. For each species, we looked at the global

assessment to determine their IUCN Red List Category. Only Near Threatened, Vulnerable,
Endangered and Critically Endangered species were included for comparison. Some species did
not have enough global data for assessment (data deficient); these species are the Orcinus orca
(Killer whale), Kogia breviceps (Pygmy sperm whale) and Mesoplodon bidens (Sowerby's
beaked whale). Moreover, it is important to note that these assessments of risk provide a
worldwide overview of which species are at risk. Local populations need to be assessed because
they may still be at risk from a potential virus spillover for susceptible species.
2.4. Geo-mapping of Alaska wastewater plants and species at risk
To identify high-risk areas for virus spillover in Alaska, we overlaid geo-mapping data with
marine mammal population data. Wastewater treatment plant outfall location, treatment type,
maximum daily flow, and name of receiving water body was assembled through permit search of
the Alaska permit database maintained through the Alaska Department of Environmental and
Conservation. These data are summarized in Supplemental Table 2. Two types of general
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits were used: i) small publicly
owned treatment works and other small treatment works providing secondary treatment of
domestic discharge to surface water (general permit number: AKG572000) and ii) lagoons
discharging to surface water (general permit number: AKG57300). Wastewater treatment plants
discharging through federally granted NPDES permits were not included in the dataset. The data
on the marine mammal populations was derived from a 2016 study that observed 905 marine
mammals and identified 13 different species in Alaska (Lefebvre et al., 2016). Only species
analyzed in terms of susceptibility were included from the study’s population data in the
analysis: (A) Northern fur seal (B) Stellar sea lions, (C) Northern sea otters, (D) Harbor seals,
(E) Beluga whale, (F) Harbor porpoises, (G) Humpback whale.

3. Results
3.1. ACE2 variation in marine mammal species
Since marine mammals are at risk from wastewater carrying the virus, we sought out to
comprehensively characterize their potential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 by examining all the
publicly available sequenced genomes of marine mammal species. Our goal was to generate a
thorough index identifying which marine mammal species are most at risk from waterborne
athropogenic transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which could serve to urge additional cautionary
measures for the protection of the vulnerable species. In all examined marine mammal genomes,
both ACE2 binding residues D30 and M82 were mutated except for Balaenoptera bonaerensis
(Anarctic Minke whale), which only has a M82 mutation (Fig.1). However, these two mutations
did not have a large destabilizing effect on the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
to ACE2. The most mutations observed in the ACE2 consensus binding residues were identified
in the Zalophus californianus (California Sea Lion) ACE2 receptor (8/25), which had a drastic
reduction in virus binding affinity to the receptor (Fig.1). Similarly, Sirenia (sea cows) which
only had one representative genome available, Trichechus manatus (West Indian Manatee), was
predicted to have low susceptibility (7/25 residues mutated) (Fig.1).
In contrast, there were a number of species (e.g, Leptonychotes weddellii (Weddell seal)
and Enhydra lutris (sea otter)) with a relatively high number of binding residue mutations (6-8)
but were predicted to have higher affinity binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by
MutaBind2 (Fig.1), thus being potentially more susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that
domestic cats used as our reference species. There are 15 species (of 36 examined) that have
ACE2 receptors carrying mutations that further stabilize the interaction between the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein and the ACE2 receptor. It is possible that these results reflect the origins of the

virus in more closely related-mammals in evolutionary terms, likely bats and/or pangolins as
reservoirs, which are more closely related to marine mammals than humans (Liu et al., 2020).
Overall, we predict these 15 high-risk species that harbour stabilizing mutations in the ACE2
receptor will be the most vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection if exposed.
3.2. Cetacea, Pinnepedia and Fissipedia susceptibility
Our analysis has predicted which species are most susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The
majority of Cetacea species (18/21 species) are predicted to have high or higher than human
susceptibility to the virus (Fig.1). ACE2 orthologs of cetaceans more so resemble the human
ACE2 receptor in comparison to the other groups (Fig.1). Since many cetacean species are
social, such as the Tursiops truncates (bottlenose dolphin) and Delphinapterus leucas (beluga
whale), their high susceptibility suggests that their populations are especially vulnerable to intraspecies transmission of a novel virus such as SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.1). The Mesoplodon bidens
(Sowerby's beaked whale) was the only cetacean with predicted low susceptibility and has
unique mutations in its ACE2 receptor such as S19P and Q24K (Fig.1). A group of closely
related cetaceans (Orcinus orca, Globicephala melas, Lagenorhynchus obliquidens, Tursiops
truncatus, and Sousa chinensis) are all predicted to more highly susceptible to the virus than
humans. Therefore, many cetaceans appear to be at risk of contracting the virus if exposed.
Like Cetacea, the majority of Pinnepedia (seal) species (8/9) are also predicted to be
highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1). Two seal species, Arctocephalus gazella and
Halichoerus grypus, had gaps in their orthologous ACE2 gene and were not included in the
analysis. However, many of their mutations resemble that of the other seal species that were
predicted to be highly susceptible. The one exception is the lowly susceptible California sea lion,
which has a novel N330D mutation in its orthologous ACE2 protein that appears to interfere

with virus binding (Fig.1). It is also noteworthy that of all the examined marine mammal
species, the Odobenus rosmarus (Atlantic Walrus) ACE2 is predicted to interact and bind with
the greatest affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Fig.1). Among Fissipedia, Enhydra lutris
(sea otters) are highly susceptible to the virus but polar bears are expected to have reduced
susceptibility (Fig.1). We analyzed two sea otter subspecies genomes, the Northern (E.lutris
kenyoni) and Southern (E.lutris nereis) sea otters and identified that both species have the same
ACE2 mutations and were predicted to be highly susceptible. Thus, seals, walruses and otters
represent at-risk species that may be impacted by waterborne anthropogenic transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 virus.
3.3. Over half of species predicted to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 are already species at
risk globally
Species that are at risk because of different anthropogenic sources are already the focus of
conservation biologists around the world. To assess both the current risk of extinction for these
species and the potential for SARS-CoV-2 spillover into their global populations, we crossreferenced their conservation status with their predicted susceptibility (Fig.2). We identified 15
species that are already at risk globally that fall under the categories of Near threatened,
Vulnerable, Endangered and Critically endangered. The 15 species are predicted to be medium to
higher susceptibility to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than humans. Only 2 of the 15 species fall under
the “Near threatened” status (Balaenoptera bonaerensis and Eumetopias jubatus) (Fig.2).
Furthermore, both the Lipotes vexillifer (Baiji) and Phocoena sinus (Vaquita) are critically
endangered species that are predicted to have high susceptibility to the SARS-CoV-2 virus
(Fig.2). Special care and attention are needed with our interactions with these species and with
wastewater management in localities that are in proximity to habitats where populations from

any of these 15 species are found. If these organisms are infected by SARS-CoV-2, their already
dwindling population numbers will be even more at risk.
3.4. Wastewater treatment plants in Alaska and risk to endemic species
The identification of wastewater treatment plants and assessing the contribution of a municipality
in terms of untreated wastewater discharge into natural water systems can help predict the
potential hotspots for a spillover event. In Alaska, as of Aug 7th, 2020, there were 4221
confirmed cases of COVID-19 and this number continues to rise. Alaska is home to many marine
mammal species, including a diverse variety of cetacean, seal and otter populations. Since there
is a diversity of marine mammals in Alaska and their populations are well documented, we
overlaid this information with available data on the wastewater treatment plants in this state.
Using this approach, we were able to determine the potential geographic locations and species at
high risk for anthropogenic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via wastewater effluent in the state
(Fig.3).
In Alaska, to treat wastewater there are lagoons (a form of primary treatment) and
secondary treatment through wastewater treatment plants. The efficiency of lagoon treatment in
dealing with SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be examined. However, SARS-CoV-2 has shown to be
stable in a variety of environmental conditions and lagoon treatment is likely not sufficient for
removing all infectious particles of the virus (Aboubakr, Sharafeldin, & Goyal, 2020; A. Chin et
al., 2020). In contrast, secondary treatment appears to be efficient for removing most but does
not remove all traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, as described Randazzo et al., (2020). We identified
that municipalities of the northern and southern shores of Alaska rely mostly on secondary
treatment for dealing with wastewater (Fig.3). In contrast, the western shores are dominated by

high on the western shore, with many lagoons permitted to discharge from 2000-2500 m3/d of
wastewater effluent (Fig.3). Three seal species are found along the western shore: the Phoca
hispida (Ringed seal), Erignathus barbatus (Bearded seal) and Phoca largha (Spotted seal) (in
order of prevalence). We are not able to predict the relative susceptibility of these species to
SARS-CoV-2 due to an absence of publicly available genomic data for these species. However,
one thing to note is that the Ringed seal and Spotted seal belong to the Phoca clade that are
closely related to the harbor seal which was predicted to have high susceptibility to SARS-CoV2 (Fig.1). Thus, the western shore has multiple high-risk areas for virus spillover, and it will be
important going forward to gather data on their ACE2 receptor sequence for the 3 seal species to
properly assess potential risk in these populations.
Susceptible species examined in our study can be found primarily in the south shore of
Alaska, within the Gulf of Alaska (Fig.3). Most of the wastewater treatment plants across the
southern shores are secondary treatment plants that should efficiently remove SARS-CoV-2
(Fig.3). However, we have identified some high-risk locations in the south shore where lagoon
treatment is used in the vicinity of marine mammals. These high-risk locations are the Cold Bay,
Naknek, Dillingham and Palmer (Fig.3). The City of Cold Bay discharges wastewater into Cold
Bay, where there are Northern sea otter populations (also found around the Aleutian Islands) that
are predicted to be highly susceptible to the virus (Fig. 3). Similarly, beluga whales predicted to
have high susceptibility can be found in Bristol Bay near Naknek, a city which relies only on
lagoon treatment prior to the discharge of wastewater effluent into Bristol Bay (Fig.3). Like
Naknek, Dillingham also discharges wastewater into Nushagak River where beluga whales are
found (Fig.3) (Citta et al., 2016). In Palmer, wastewater effluent flows into the Talkeetna River,
which is a tributary to the Susitna River and home to two species predicted to have high

susceptibility, the beluga whales and harbor seals (Fig.3). The beluga whales found in Palmer
belong to the Cook Inlet population that are currently endangered. Therefore, efforts to mitigate
and carefully assess the impact of the wastewater effluent discharged only after primary
treatment into theses marine mammal habitats will be important for protecting the species.
4. Discussion
Biological conservation focuses on assessing the impact of humans on biological diversity and
determining how we can protect species that are at risk from extinction. Our impact on wildlife
during a global pandemic may include the potential transmission of novel viruses to susceptible
animals. In our study, we identified that half of the species predicted to be highly susceptible to
SARS-CoV-2, based on ACE2 receptor conservation, are ones that are already at-risk species
around the world. A potential reverse zoonoses event of SARS-CoV-2 may have grave
implications for wildlife if not studied and mitigated. Currently there are many unknowns
surrounding the biological effects and transmission of this novel virus in humans and other
mammals. Thus, our study urges the need to act in a cautionary way during the current COVID19 pandemic and future pandemics to protect marine wildlife through proper wastewater
management.
Our analyses indicate that many different marine mammal species have an ACE2
receptor that is predicted to bind SARS-CoV-2 at a similar binding affinity as the human
receptor, indicating that these species may contract the virus if encountered in their environment.
The similarity in binding affinity stems from many of the key residues involved in the interaction
being conserved. In addition, several of the ACE2 orthologs are predicted to bind tighter than the
human ACE2 receptor with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (i.e, higher than human susceptibility) and it
is possible that infection may occur at lower titres of the virus in these species. Based on the

studies looking at how cetaceans and seals are affected by other coronaviruses, the pathological
outcomes may be devastating for certain species. Infection with other coronaviruses in these
species leads to severe necrosis of the liver (in beluga whales) and lung necrosis (in Pacific
harbor seals) (Mihindukulasuriya et al., 2008; Woo et al., 2014). In humans, research is pointing
towards the notion that COVID-19 is also a multi-organ disease, with many different organs such
as the lung, heart, kidneys, liver, brain, blood vessels and colon, all being affected after virus
infection (Robba, Battaglini, Pelosi, & Rocco, 2020). Multi-organ infection was also shown for
the related SARS-CoV-1 virus (Gu et al., 2005). Thus, the impacts of COVID-19 will likely
extend from humans to susceptible wildlife and include the loss of life for susceptible marine
mammals that succumb to multi-organ pathology.
The likelihood of further cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2, once in a marine
species population, is also something to consider in conservation efforts. As discussed above,
novel coronaviruses have already been found in cetaceans, indicating that viral disease is an
important factor in their continued survival. These viruses belong to the Gammacoronavirus
family, a group related to the Betacoronavirus family which include SARS-like viruses. The
novel coronaviruses were identified in both the aforementioned social bottlenose dolphin and
beluga whale (Mihindukulasuriya et al., 2008; Wang, Maddox, et al., 2020; Woo et al., 2014).
These cetacean coronaviruses are related, and the strains identified in bottlenose dolphin were
rapidly evolving, indicating a potential cross-species transmission event from beluga whales to
the dolphins. Cases of cross-species transmission from humans to marine mammals has already
been observed. Sea otters were implicated with the H1N1 pandemic (2009). Northern sea otters
were tested two years after the pandemic and ~70% of the tested individuals were serologically
positive for the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (Li et al., 2014). The chain of transmission is

complex and it appears that the Northern sea otters were likely infected after being in proximity
to Mirounga angustirostris (Elephant seals) that also were infected by Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09
virus (Goldstein et al., 2013). In the case of the Elephant seals, a suggested hypothesis behind
their infection with a human pandemic virus was their exposure to human excrement discharged
in the water by shipping vessels in the area (Goldstein et al., 2013). Treatment measures may be
required for shipping vessels during the COVID-19 pandemic since SARS-CoV-2 is also found
in human waste. Furthermore, the chain of transmission highlights how anthropogenic factors
have the capacity to cause the cross-species spillover of a pandemic-type virus. Furthermore, the
interspecific transmission of the novel coronaviruses in both cetaceans and otters indicates the
epizootic potential for their social species. Thus, the predicted high susceptibility to SARS-CoV2 indicates that cetaceans may be at risk from a potential spillover of the current pandemic and if
so, large portions of social cetacean populations could be affected.
Most seals are coastal species and for this reason, of concern with the current pandemic
and their high susceptibility. In the past, an epizootic pneumonia that killed 21 Phoca vitulina
richardsii (Pacific harbor Seal) seals off the coast of California was linked to a novel seal
coronavirus (Nollens, Wellehan, Archer, Lowenstine, & Gulland, 2010). The lungs isolated from
these seals showed signs of necrotizing lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia with intra-lesional
bacteria. To make matters worse, the coronavirus was persistent within their populations and
could be identified again 8 years later (Ng et al., 2011). Therefore, exposure of the seals to
sewage-derived human SARS-CoV-2 virus in coastal waters could have similar long-lasting
consequences for their populations and exacerbated by the fact that these animals are highly
social.

In our analysis of wastewater management practices in Alaska, we identified that most of
the wastewater treatment plants in the vicinity of marine mammals were utilizing secondary
treatment, which likely rules out the possibility of virus exposure in these areas. However, there
were certain locations that bordered marine mammal populations that only relied on primary
treatment, which we identify as high-risk locations such as Palmer, Dillingham and Naknek. In
Palmer, the beluga whale is at risk of exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus from wastewater
effluent (Fig.3). The beluga whale population residing in Susitna River belong to an endangered
population in the Cook Inlet that the river flows into (Goetz, Montgomery, Ver Hoef, Hobbs, &
Johnson, 2012). In addition, although Anchorage (the most populated city in Alaska) wastewater
treatment plants hold permits for secondary treatment, as of 2019, the permit of John M. Asplund
Wastewater Treatment of Anchorage was modified to be primary (Anchorage Water and Waste
Utility, 2019). Many Cook Inlet beluga whales have been observed to swim close to the effluent
of the wastewater treatment plant and these animals may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 from
current wastewater treatment practices in Anchorage. Thus, Palmer and Anchorage wastewater
management are concerning for the Cook Inlet beluga during the COVID-19 pandemic, one of
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries’ “Species in the
spotlight” - an initiative to save the most highly at-risk marine species. As such, wastewater
discharge was already noted as one of the threats to the Cook Inlet beluga whales. A potential
virus spillover into the Cook Inlet population of highly social and susceptible beluga whales may
have devastating consequences for the success of their population moving forward. Thus,
additional measures of treating the water in these areas would help protect the species and reduce
the probability of them being exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
5. Conclusions and future directions
19

In our study, we determined that many marine mammal species are predicted to be susceptible to
SARS-CoV-2 based on conservation of the virus host receptor ACE2. We then revealed how
current wastewater management approaches in certain Alaskan localities may not be sufficient
for preventing waterborne exposure of nearby marine mammals to the virus. Our work urges for
greater caution in considering how wastewater management practices can play a role in disease
transmission, including reverse zoonotic transmission of waterborne pathogens from humans to
susceptible non-human species during pandemics.
Given the grave consequences of waterborne anthropogenic transmission of SARS-CoV2 to marine populations, are there concrete steps we can take to mitigate the risks to wild and
captive marine animal populations from current and future pandemics? To begin to address this
question, we have assembled a list of possible approaches (Table 1). For example, restricting
contact and access to at-risk species in marine parks could help protect captive marine mammals.
Such an approach has been suggested to protect other susceptible species including lions and
tigers, following the reverse zoonotic infection of a tiger with SARS-CoV-2 at the Bronx Zoo in
New York (Wang, Mitchell, et al., 2020). Similarly, non-human primate Old world apes and
monkeys are also predicted to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and these findings have led
to improved measures for protecting these primates at zoos (Melin, Janiak, Marrone, Arora, &
Higham, 2020). Such restriction measures should be present also in aquariums hosting
susceptible marine mammals as well going forward.
For wild animal populations, the major concern will be the potential for wastewater
exposure. We will need to improve our efforts towards monitoring and testing marine mammal
populations to determine if any reverse zoonotic transmission events have occurred. New
monitoring technologies will be powerful for such tasks. For example, SnotBot, where a drone
20

retrieves mucus from whales, may be utilized to identify any virus spillover events since SARSCoV-2 will likely be detected in the mucus of infected animals (Wolinsky, 2017). Non-invasive
approaches like SnotBot are invaluable for the monitoring of virus spillover. Therefore, research
into how we can continue monitoring these species post-pandemic will be paramount for
assessing the impact of a human pandemic on wildlife.
We have described how potential high-risk spillover events can be identified using
Alaska as a case study. If potential virus spillover is identified, a feasible approach may be
vaccination of certain inland freshwater (e.g., otters) or coastal marine mammal populations
(e.g., seals). The vaccination approach was previously shown to be feasible in a study of
vaccination of Sable Island grey seals, where it was used as a form of contraception (Brown et
al., 1997). Since the vaccination technology is available, it is not far-fetched to imagine that wild
populations affected by the virus, just like humans, can be protected by herd immunity through
vaccination.
Finally, the assessment and appropriate treatment of wastewater is a measure that will be
key in reducing the effect of sewage transmission of the virus into natural water systems.
Specifically, Shutler et al. (2020) outlines which countries pose the highest risk based on survival
of the virus in wastewater. As such, high risk areas should act with caution and be attentive
regarding how their wastewater is handled and treated. Similarly, we have described how
analyzing localities (like Alaska) for susceptible species and their relative risk based on
wastewater treatment can be helpful for determining localities of concern. In underdeveloped
nations with poor sanitation, the major concern is on public health and the potential for the virus
to contaminate human drinking water reservoirs. However, these nations are also particularly
high risk for virus spillover if large amounts of raw sewage are discharged into natural water

systems containing susceptible species. Thus, additional measures for treating sewage are
important for both the health of the public and wildlife in these countries. Moreover, pinpointing
locations of sewage overflows, and pipe leakage will allow for us to better assess where there is
the most potential for wildlife to be affected. At this point in the pandemic, the available
evidence indicates that wastewater is an important vector for SARS-CoV-2 transmission for
humans and susceptible wildlife. Given the proximity of marine animals to high-risk
environments where viral spill over is likely, we must act with foresight to protect marine
mammal species predicted to be at-risk and mitigate the environmental impact of the COVID-19
pandemic.

SnotBot is a technology to study whale populations using a noninvasive approach (Wolinsky, 2017). Drones are utilized to

and pregnancy status of the whale. The approach may also be
useful for identifying infected whales.
The vaccination approach was previously utilized in a feasible
manner on Sable Island for wild grey seals, where it was used as

technology is available, it may also be used for the purpose of
protecting species from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Currently, the PEG, electronegative membrane, and
ultrafiltration extraction methods are commonly utilized for the
recovery of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater for qPCR

Consequently, improving the methods for extracting both

Figure 1. Marine mammal species are predicted to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Species of
Cetaceans, Fissipeds and Pinnipeds are predicted to be highly susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 virus based
on their ACE2 receptor. Genomes of 36 marine mammal species (all publicly available genomes for
marine mammals on NCBI) were utilized to identify mutations in the ACE2 residues that bind SARSCoV-2 to then determine susceptibility. The 20 consensus binding residues targeted by the SARS-CoV-2
virus are shown, with mutations denoted in orthologs noted (X= unknown residue; aligning regions were
not available for Arctocephalus gazelle and Halichoerus grypus whole shotgun genome sequences). The
susceptibility of species was scored using the MutaBind2 tool that determined how the mutations in
ACE2 orthologs affected the binding affinity of the virus. Species were grouped in terms of susceptibility
as follows: higher than human susceptibility (if binding affinity was increased by the mutations), high,
medium and low. The phylogenetic tree and relationships between species were gathered from TimeTree
(http://www.timetree.org) a database providing insight into the evolutionary relationships between
species. Branch lengths are not representative of evolutionary times for the phylogenetic tree.

Figure 2. Marine mammal species predicted to be susceptible belong to the IUCN Red list.
Many of the species predicted to be susceptible are members of the IUCN Red list of Threatened
Species (https://www.iucnredlist.org). The IUCN Red list is an indicator of the world’s
biodiversity and provides the most comprehensive data on the global conservation status of a
species. 15 susceptible species ranging from medium to higher than human predicted
susceptibilities can be identified on the IUCN Red list. Conservation statuses updated as of July
25th, 2020 were used. Silhouettes of species were drawn or obtained from PhyloPic
(http://phylopic.org).

Figure 3. Wastewater management in Alaska identifies high risk areas for potential virus
spillover. Geo-mapping of wastewater treatment plants was done using data from the Alaska
Department of Environmental and Conservation. Types of treatment are listed for each plant
(lagoon or secondary) and flow data is included. Overlap between species predicted to be
susceptible and wastewater treatment plants that utilize lagoon treatment are identified as highrisk areas. High-risk sites and facilities discussed are bordered in black (Palmer; Talkeetna
Lagoon), blue (City of Cold Bay; Cold Bay Lagoon), purple (Naknek; Naknek Lagoon) and red
(Dillingham; Dillingham Lagoon). Marine mammal population data was obtained from a
previous study (Lefebvre et al., 2016). Populations shown on the map in hexagons (represents 15 individuals observed at that location) and include the following species: (A) Northern fur seal
(B) Stellar sea lions, (C) Northern sea otters, (D) Harbor seals, (E) Beluga whale, (F) Harbor
porpoises, (G) Humpback whale. The colours of the hexagon species indicators describe
predicted susceptibility; orange is high susceptibility and red is higher than human susceptibility.
Grey hexagons indicate the Phoca hispida (Ringed seal), Erignathus barbatus (Bearded seal)
and Phoca largha (Spotted seal) found in those areas. These species were not included in the
analysis since their genomes are uncharacterized.
