Abstract
COVID-19 has become a global pandemic that threatens millions of people worldwide.
There is an urgent call for developing effective drugs against the virus (SARS-CoV-2)
causing this disease. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2, 3C-like protease (3CLpro), is
highly conserved across coronaviruses and is essential for the maturation process of
viral polyprotein. Scutellariae radix (Huangqin in Chinese), the root of Scutellaria
baicalensis has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat viral infection
related symptoms. The extracts of S. baicalensis have exhibited broad spectrum
antiviral activities. We studied the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of S. baicalensis and its
ingredient compounds. We found that the ethanol extract of S. baicalensis inhibits
SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity in vitro and the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells
with an EC50 of 0.74 g/ml. Among the major components of S. baicalensis, baicalein
strongly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity with an IC50 of 0.39 M. We further
identified four baicalein analogue compounds from other herbs that inhibit SARS-CoV2 3CLpro activity at microM concentration. Our study demonstrates that the extract of
S. baicalensis has effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and baicalein and analogue
compounds are strong SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors.

Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are single stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that cause severe
infections in respiratory, hepatic and various organs in humans and many other
animals[1, 2]. Within the 20 years of the 21st century, there are already three outbreaks
of CoV-causing global epidemics, including SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. The newly
emerged CoV infectious disease (COVID-19) already caused more than 1.5 million
confirmed infections and 89 thousands deaths worldwide up to April 9, 2020
(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports).
There is an urgent call for drug and vaccine research and development against COVID19.

COVID-19 was confirmed to be caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), whose
genome was sequenced in early January 2020[3, 4]. The genomic sequence of SARSCoV-2 is highly similar to that of SARS-CoV with 79.6% sequence identity [5] and
remain stable up to now[6]. However, the sequence identities vary significantly for
different viral proteins[7]. For instance, the spike proteins (S-protein) in CoVs are
diverse in sequences and even in the host receptors that bind due to the rapid mutations
and recombination[8]. Although it has been confirmed that both SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 use ACE2 as receptor and occupy the same binding site, their binding affinities
to ACE2 vary due to subtle interface sequence variations[9]. On the contrary, the 3Clike proteases (3CLpro) in CoVs are highly conserved. The 3CLpro in SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 share a sequence identity of 96.1 %, making it an ideal target for broad

spectrum anti-CoV therapy.

Although many inhibitors have been reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
3CLpro[10-13], unfortunately none of them has entered into clinical trial. Inspired by
the previous studies, several covalent inhibitors were experimentally identified to
inhibit the 3CLpro activity and viral replication of SARS-CoV-2, and some of the
complex crystal structures were solved[14, 15]. In addition, a number of clinically used
HIV and HCV protease inhibitors have been proposed as possible cure for COVID-19
[16] and some of them are now processed to clinically trials[17]. Several computational
studies proposed potential SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors by virtual screening against
the crystal or modeled three-dimensional structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro as well as
machine intelligence[18-23]. Highly potent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors with
diverse chemical structures need further exploration.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herbs and formulae have long been used in
treating viral diseases. Some of them have been clinically tested to treat COVID-19[24].
Scutellariae radix (Huangqin in Chinese), the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi,
has been widely used in TCM for heat clearing, fire purging, detoxification and
hemostasis. Huangqin is officially recorded in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015
Edition)[25] and European Pharmacopoeia (10th Edition)[26]. Its anti-tumor, antiviral,
anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activities have been reported[27]. Remarkably,
the extracts of S. baicalensis have exhibited broad spectrum anti-viral activities,

including ZIKA[28], H1N1[29], HIV[30] and DENV[31]. In addition, a multicenter,
retrospective analysis demonstrated that S. baicaleinsis exhibits more potent antiviral
effects and higher clinical efficacy than ribavirin for the treatment of hand, foot and
mouth disease[32]. Several S. baicalensis derived mixtures or pure compounds have
been approved as antiviral drugs, such as Baicalein capsule (to treat hepatitis) and
Huangqin tablet (to treat upper respiratory infection) in China. Most of the S.
baicaleinsis ingredients are flavonoids[33]. Flavonoids from other plants were also
reported to mildly inhibit SARS and MERS-CoV 3CLpro [34, 35]. Here we studied the
anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of S. baicalensis and its ingredients. We found that the
ethanol extract of S. baicalensis inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity and the most
active ingredient baicalein exhibits an IC50 of 0.39 M. In addition, the ethanol extract
of S. baicalensis effectively inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cell assay. We
also identified four baicalein analogue compounds from other herbs that inhibit SARSCoV-2 3CLpro activity at microM concentration.

Results and Discussion
The ethanol extract of S. baicalensis strongly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
We prepared the 70% ethanol extract of S. baicalensis and tested its inhibitory activity
against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. We expressed SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and performed
activity assay using a peptide substrate (Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-pNA) according to
the published procedure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro assay[11, 36]. The inhibitory ratio of S.
baicalensis extract at different concentrations on SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity were

shown in Figure 1A. The crude extract exhibits significant inhibitory effect with an IC50
of 8.5 g/ml, suggesting that S. baicalensis contains candidate inhibitory ingredients
against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.

Baicalein is the major active ingredient in S. baicalensis that inhibits SARS-CoV2 3CLpro
We tested the inhibitory activity of four major ingredients from S. baicalensis: baicalein,
baicalin, wogonin and wogonoside in vitro. Baicalein showed the most potent antiSARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity with an IC50 of 0.39 M (Figure 1B and Table 1). Baicalin
inhibited SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity for about 41% at 50 μM, while wogonin and
wogonoside were not active at this concentration.

Chemical Structure

We performed molecular docking to understand the inhibitory activity of S. baicalensis
ingredients. In the docking model, baicalein binds well in the substrate binding site of
SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro with its 6-OH and 7-OH forming hydrogen bond interactions with
the carbonyl group of L141 and the backbone amide group of G143, respectively
(Figure 2A). In addition, the carbonyl group of baicalein is hydrogen bonded with the
backbone amide group of E166. The catalytic residues H41 and C145 are well covered
by baicalein, accounting for its inhibitory effect. As the 7-OH in baicalin is in close
contact with the protein, there may not be enough space for glycosyl modification,
explaining the low activity of baicalin. As for wogonin, the absence of 6-OH together

with its additional 8-methoxyl group alters the binding orientation and weakens the
binding strength (Figure 2B). Hydrogen bond is observed between its 5-OH and the
backbone carbonyl group of L141, while the interaction with E166 by its 8-methoxy
group is weaker than that formed by the carbonyl group in baicalein.

S. baicalensis extract and baicalein inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero
cells
We tested the antiviral activity of S. baicalensis ethanol extract and baicalein against
SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR. Vero cells were pre-treated with the extract or baicalein
for 1h, followed by virus infection for 2h. Virus input was then washed out and the cells
were treated with medium containing the extract or baicalein. Viral RNA was extracted
from the supernatant of the infected cells and quantified by RT-PCR. The S. baicalensis
ethanol extract significantly reduced the growth of the virus with an EC50 of 0.74 g/ml

with low cytotoxicity (SI > 675.68, Figure 3A). Baicalein inhibits the replication of
SARS-CoV2 with an EC50 of about 17.6 M and SI > 2.8 (Figure 3B). The high activity
of S. baicalensis crude extract in the antiviral assay implies it may also interact with
other viral or host targets in addition to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibition, which can be
further explored in the future.

Searching for baicalein analogues that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
We searched for baicalein analogues from available flavonoid suppliers and selected 8
flavonoids and 2 glycosides for experimental testing. Four flavonoid compounds were
found to be potent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors. Among them, scutellarein is mainly
distributed in genus Scutellaria and Erigerontis herba (Dengzhanxixin or Dengzhanhua
in Chinese) in its glucuronide form, scutellarin. Scutellarin has long been used in
cardiovascular disease treatment for its ability to improve cerebral blood supply[37].
Scutellarein inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro with an IC50 value of 5.8 M, while
scutellarin showed mild inhibitory activity at 50 μM concentration. The other three

flavonoid compounds, dihydromyricetin, quercetagetin and myricetin derived from
Ampelopsis japonica (Bailian in Chinese), Eriocaulon buergerianum (Gujingcao in
Chinese) and Polygoni avicularis (Bianxu in Chinese) respectively, inhibit SARS-CoV2 3CLpro with IC50 values of 1.20, 1.24 and 2.86 M. Interestingly, scutellarein and
myricetin were reported to inhibit the SARS-CoV indicating their potential as multitarget anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents[38].

For all the active flavonoid compounds that we found, the introduction of glycosyl
group, as in the case of baicalein and baicalin, decreased the inhibition activity,
probably due to the steric hindrance of the glycosyl group, which is also true for
scutellarein/scutellarin,

corresponding aglycones are often interchangeable in vivo, for instance, baicalin was
reported to be metabolized to baicalein in intestine[39], while baicalein can be
transformed to baicalin by hepatic metabolism[40], we expect that both the flavonoid
form of the active compounds and their glycoside form will function in vivo. We suggest
that these compounds can be further optimized or used to search for other TCM herbs
containing these compounds or substructures for the treatment of COVID-19.

Construction of plasmid SARS-CoV-2 pET 3CL-21x, protein expression and
purification
The DNA of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (referred to GenBank, accession number
MN908947) was synthesized (Hienzyme Biotech) and amplified by PCR using
primers n3CLP-Nhe (5’- CATGGCTAGCGGTTTTAGAAAAATGGCATTCCC-3’)
and n3CLP-Xho (5’- CACTCTCGAGTTGGAAAGTAACACCTGAGC-3’). The
PCR product was digested with Nhe I/Xho I and cloned into the pET 21a DNA as
reported previously [41]. The resulting SARS-CoV-2 pET 3CL-21x plasmid encodes
a 35 064 Da SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro with a C-terminal 6xHis-tag. The SARS-CoV-2
pET 3CL-21x plasmid was further transformed to E. coli BL21<DE3> for protein
expression as reported [41]. The recombinant protein was purified through a nickelnitrilotriacetic acid column (GE Healthcare) and subsequently loaded on a gel
filtration column Sephacryl S-200 HR (GE Healthcare) for further purification as
previously described [42].

Enzyme inhibition assay
A colorimetric substrate Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-pNA (GL Biochemistry Ltd) and
assay buffer (40 mM PBS, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton 100, pH 7.3) was
used for the inhibition assay. Stock solutions of the inhibitor were prepared with 100%
DMSO. The 100 µl reaction systems in assay buffer contain 0.5 µM protease and 5%
DMSO or inhibitor to the final concentration. Firstly, dilute SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro with
assay buffer to the desired concentration. 5 µl DMSO or inhibitor at various

concentrations was pre-incubated with 85 µl dilute ed SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro for 30
min at room temperature. And then add 10 µl 2 mM substrate Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-LeuGln-pNA (dissolved in water) into above system to final concentration of 200 µM to
initiate the reaction. Increase in absorbance at 390 nm was recorded for 20 min at
interval of 30 s with a kinetics mode program using a plate reader (Synergy, Biotek).
The percent of inhibition was calculated by Vi/V0, where V0 and Vi represent the mean
reaction rate of the enzyme incubated with DMSO or compounds. IC50 was fitted with
Hill1 function.

Molecular docking
The structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (PDB ID 6LU7)[14] and S. baicalensis
components were prepared using Protein Preparation Wizard and LigPrep module,
respectively. Then, the binding site was defined as a 20*20*20 Å3 cubic box centered
to the centroid of C145. After that, molecular docking was performed using Glide. Extra
precision (XP) and flexible ligand sampling were adopted. Post-docking minimization
was performed to further refine the docking results. All the above mentioned modules
were implemented in Schrödinger version 2015-4 (Schrödinger software suite, L. L. C.
New York, NY (2015).)

Cell culture and virus
Vero cell line (ATCC, CCL-81) was cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s
medium (DMEM, Gibco, Grand Island, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine

serum (FBS, Gibco) in the atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells were digested with 0.25%
trypsin and uniformly seeded in 96-well plates with a density of 2×104 cells/well prior
infection or drug feeding. The virus (C-Tan-nCoV Wuhan strain 01) used is a SARSCOV-2 clinically isolated virus strain. These viruses were propagated in Vero cells.

Antiviral activity Assay
The cytotoxicity of S. baicalensis extract and baicalein on Vero cells were determined
by CCK8 assays (DOJINDO, Japan). We then evaluated the antiviral efficiency of S.
Baicalensis extract and baicalein against SARS-COV-2 (C-Tan-nCoV Wuhan strain 01)
virus in vitro. Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 2×104 cells/well and
then grown for 24 hours. Cells were pre-treated with indicated concentrations of S.
Baicalensis extract or baicalein for 1 h, and the virus (MOI of 0.01, 200 PFU/well) was
subsequently added to allow infection for 2 h at 37℃.Virus input was washed with
DMEM and then the cells were treated with medium contained drugs at various
concentrations for 48h. The supernatant was collected and the RNA was extracted and
analyzed by relative quantification using RT-PCR as in the previous study[3,43].

RNA extraction and RT-qPCR
Viral RNA was extracted from 100 μL supernatant of infected cells using the automated
nucleic acid extraction system (TIANLONG, China), following the manufacturer’s
recommendations. SARS-COV-2 virus detection was performed using the One Step
PrimeScript RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa, Japan) on the LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR
