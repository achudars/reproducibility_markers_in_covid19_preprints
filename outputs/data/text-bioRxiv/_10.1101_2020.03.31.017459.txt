Abstract

21

A novel Coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) has now become a global pandemic. Considering the

22

severity of infection and the associated mortalities, there is an urgent need to develop an

23

effective preventive measure against this virus. In this study, we have designed a novel vaccine

24

construct using computational strategies. Spike (S) glycoprotein is the major antigenic

25

component that trigger the host immune responses. Detailed investigation of S protein with

26

various immunoinformatics tools enabled us to identify 5 MHC I and 5 MHC II B-cell derived

27

T-cell epitopes with VaxiJen score > 1 and IC50 value < 100nM. These epitopes were joined with

28

a suitable adjuvant and appropriate linkers to form a multi-epitope based vaccine construct.

29

Further, in silico testing of the vaccine construct for its antigenicity, allergenicity, solubility, and

30

other physicochemical properties showed it to be safe and immunogenic. Suitable tertiary

31

structure of the vaccine protein was generated using 3Dpro of SCRATCH suite, refined with

32

GalaxyRefine, and validated with ProSA, PROCHECK, and ERRAT server. Finally, molecular

33

docking studies were performed to ensure a favorable binding affinity between the vaccine

34

construct and TLR3 receptor. The designed multi-epitope vaccine showed potential to elicit

35

specific immune responses against the SARS-COV-2. However, further wet lab validation is

36

necessary to confirm the actual effectiveness, safety and immunogenic potency of the vaccine

37

construct against derived in this study.

Introduction

43

A novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome

44

coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single and positive stranded RNA virus that belongs to the

45

order Nidovirales and family Coronaviridae (Huang et al., 2020). The 2019-nCoV shares 79.5%

46

and 96% of genome similarity with SARS-CoV and bat Coronavirus, respectively (Zhou et al.,

47

2020; Zhu et al., 2020). The first incidence of cluster of pneumonia like symptoms were reported

48

from the Wuhan city of the China in December, 2019 and the disease spread rapidly in other

49

countries in a very short span. At last, on 11 March 2020, the Coronavirus disease 2019

50

(COVID-19) outbreak was officially declared as pandemic by the World Health Organization

51

(WHO).

52

The outbreak of disease probably started from a single or multiple zoonotic transmission events

53

from wet market in Wuhan, where meat and game animals were sold (Riou and Althaus, 2020).

54

As of March 30, 2020, it has resulted in 6,93,224 confirmed cases with 33,106 deaths over 202

55

countries and territories (WHO Situation Report-70) [https://www.who.int/docs/default-

56

source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200330-sitrep-70-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=7e0fe3f8_2].

57

Common signs of infection include fever, cough, breathing difficulties and shortness of breath.

58

In more extreme cases, infection can cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and

59

even death.

60

In order to control the rapidly spreading SARS-COV-2 infection, there is an urgent need to

61

design a suitable vaccine candidate that can prevent large scale mortalities in the future. Multi-

62

epitope based vaccines have several advantages in terms of safety, opportunity to rationally

63

design the construct for increased efficiency, efficacy, antigenicity, and immunogenicity

64

(Urrutia-Baca et al., 2019). The developmental process includes identification of virulence

65

protein and selection of peptide segments, which can generate both cellular and humoral immune

66

responses. In SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein consists of S1 and S2 domain. S1 domains can

67

recognize and bind to variety of receptors on the host cell surface for viral attachment. S2

68

domains help in fusion of host and viral membranes, allowing entry of viral genomes inside the

69

host cells (Li, 2016). Therefore, S protein can be considered as one of the most effective target

70

for the development vaccine against 2019-nCoV.

71

In the current study multiple immunoinformatics based servers and tools were used to predict T-

72

cell epitope candidates within B-cell epitopes. Such in-silico techniques ultimately reduces the

73

cost, effort and time compared to the traditional epitope identification approaches. Subsequently,

74

a multi-epitope vaccine construct was designed using the most persuasive epitopes with suitable

75

adjuvant and linkers.

76

Materials and methods

77

Retrieval of protein sequence

78

The complete amino acid sequence of surface glycoprotein or S protein of 2019-nCoV was

79

downloaded in FASTA format from National Centre for Biotechnological Information (NCBI)

80

database.

81

Prediction of linear B-cell epitopes

82

Putative linear B-cell epitopes were predicted by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based

83

server ABCpred (Saha and Raghava, 2006). The default threshold value of 0.51 and window

84

length 20 was fixed for prediction.

85

Identification of MHC I and MHC II epitopes within B-cell epitopes

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.017459; this version posted April 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

86

In order to stimulate the desired and strong immune response it is critical to identify the T-cell

87

epitopes within the B-cell epitopes. For this purpose, Propred1 and propred servers were used for

88

identification of MHC I and MHC II binding epitopes within the pre-determined linear B-cell

89

epitopic regions (Dar et al., 2019). ProPred1 is a matrix based approach uses matrices obtained

90

from Bioinformatics and Molecular Analysis Section (BIMAS) and from the literatures (Singh

91

and Raghava, 2003). Whereas, ProPred utilizes quantitative matrices derived from the published

92

literature (Singh and Raghava, 2001).

93

MHC I epitopes were assessed with all the available 47 different alleles in Propred1 server. The

94

option of proteasome and immunoproteasome filters was selected to improve the chances of

95

finding accurate epitopes. Epitopes projected to be associate with at least five different MHC I

96

alleles were retained. Whereas, MHC II epitopes were evaluated against 51 different MHC II

97

alleles available in Propred server. Only epitopes predicted by at least ten different MHC II

98

alleles were considered for further analysis. The predicted MHC I and MHC II binding epitopes

99

were further subjected to VaxiJen v.2.0 server for analyzing the antigenic propensity

100

(Doytchinova and Flower, 2007). The server was run with virus as a target field at a default

101

threshold value of 0.4.

102

Prediction of binding affinity with MHCPred

103

Predicted MHC I and MHC II epitopes with a VaxiJen score of >1.0 were further assessed for

104

their binding affinity against HLA A*1101 and DRB1*0101, respectively using MHCPred

105

version 2.0 (Guan et al., 2006). The epitopes with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)

106

value < 100 nM were shortlisted as strong candidates for construction of multi-epitope vaccine

107

construct associated with strong immunogenicity.

108

Designing of multi-epitope based vaccine construct

109

For designing of a multi-epitope vaccine construct, the prioritized epitope candidates were

110

attached with a suitable adjuvant β‐defensin, and appropriate peptide linkers such as EAAAK,

111

AAY and GPGPG.

112

Evaluation antigenicity, allergenicity, solubility, and physicochemical properties

113

Antigenicity of the final vaccine construct was evaluated by using VaxiJen v.2.0. Whereas,

114

Screening for allergenicity of any vaccine construct is crucial as it should not cause sensitization

115

and allergic reaction inside the body. AllerTOP v. 2.0 (Dimitrov et al., 2014) and AllergenFP

116

v.1.0 (Dimitrov et al., 2014) servers were used to check the allergenicity of the final vaccine

117

construct. The solubility of vaccine construct upon expression in Escherichia coli was evaluated

118

by using Protein–Sol (Hebditch et al., 2017). Furthermore, the various physicochemical

119

parameters of the construct were assessed using ProtParam server (Wilkins et al., 1999).

120

Tertiary structure prediction, refinement, and validation of vaccine protein

121

The three-dimensional structure of multi-epitope based vaccine was generated by using 3Dpro

122

server of SCRATCH suite (Cheng et al., 2005). 3Dpro uses predicted structural features, and the

123

Protein Data Bank (PDB) knowledge based statistical terms in the energy function. The

124

conformational search uses a set of movements consisting on fragment substitution (using a

125

fragment library built from the PDB), as well as random disturbance for the model. Later on the

126

structural refinement of the modelled vaccine construct was performed through GalaxyRefine

127

web server (Heo et al., 2013). This server initially reforms the side chains and executes side-

128

chain repacking and finally overall structural relaxation by molecular dynamics simulation.

129

Refined model was finally validated to identify any potential errors using ProSA-web,

130

PROCHECK server and ERRAT server.

131

Conformational B-cell epitope prediction of vaccine construct

132

DiscoTope 2.0 tool of IEDB server was used to determine conformational B-cell epitopes by

133

using validated 3D structure of vaccine construct as an input. The server incorporates novel

134

definition of the spatial neighborhood to sum propensity scores and half-sphere exposure as a

135

surface measure (Kringelum et al., 2012).

136

Molecular docking analysis and interaction studies

137

Molecular docking was performed in order to predict the binding affinity and interaction patterns

138

between the vaccine construct and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). The structure of TLR3 receptor

139

was downloaded from RCSB PDB database (PDB ID: 2A0Z) and the refined 3D structure of the

140

multi-epitope construct was used as a ligand. Finally, the binding affinity between the TLR3

141

receptor and vaccine construct was calculated by using ClusPro 2.0 server (Kozakov et al.,

142

2017). The server uses three consecutive steps like rigid body docking, clustering of lowest

143

energy structure, and structural refinement by energy minimization (Sayed et al., 2020). The best

144

docked complex was obtained based on the lowest energy weighted score and docking

145

efficiency. Visualization and interaction analysis of the docked complex were performed using

146

the Chimera v1.14 and DIMPLOT program of the LigPlot+ v.2.1, respectively.

149

The complete 1273 amino acid sequence of S protein of 2019-nCoV was retrieved with an

150

accession number YP_009724390.1 to carry out the in silico analysis.

151

Linear B-cell epitope prediction

152

A total 99 linear B-cell epitopes of 20 amino acid length (window length) was identified within

153

the spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV. All the epitopes along with their start position and

154

respective scores is shown in Supplementary Table S1.

155

Identification of B-cell derived T-cell epitopes

156

T-cell epitope prediction comprises identification MHC I and MHC II binding epitopes, in order

157

to activate both cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) and helper T-lymphocytes (HTL) mediated

158

immune response. MHC I and MHC II epitopes were searched within B-cell epitopes to identify

159

B-cell derived T-cell epitopes.

160

A total of 39 B-cell derived MHC I epitopes were predicted by ≥5 MHC I alleles available in

161

Propred1. Out of these, 19 MHC I epitopes were found with above threshold VaxiJen score. A

162

table containing MHC I binding epitopes along with number of different MHC I binding alleles

163

and VaxiJen scores are shown in Supplementary Table S2. Similarly, a total of 52 B-cell

164

derived MHC II epitopes were identified by ≥10 different MHC II alleles available in Propred

165

server. Out of which, 26 of the MHC II epitopes were having a VaxiJen score above the fixed

166

threshold. The MHC II epitopes with the number of encountering MHC II alleles and antigenic

167

scores are listed in Supplementary Table S3. However, in order to increase the precision of

168

selection 5 MHC I and 11 MHC II showing strong antigenicity score i.e. VaxiJen score > 1 were

169

selected for screening of binding affinity.

172

A*1101 allele, and five out of eleven MHC II epitopes were having favorable binding affinity

173

against DRB1*0101 in human. Finally B-cell derived T-cell epitopes were selected based on our

Discussion

252

The 2019-nCoV has become pandemic, showing no sign of abatement. The virus is highly

253

contagious in nature, causing respiratory distress that can led to eventual death in susceptible

254

individuals. Researchers across the world are fraught with the challenge of finding means for

255

halting the spread of this virus. Historically, vaccination has proved to be an effective method of

256

protecting large human population against viral diseases. Comparison to traditional vaccines like

257

killed, attenuated or live vaccines, epitope based vaccines which contain specifically targeted

258

immunogenic component of the pathogen responsible for causing diseases can be designed more

259

rationally (Pourseif et al., 2019).

260

In the present study, we focused on the identification of potential B-cell derived T-cell epitopes

261

in order to generate a potential vaccine construct which can induce both humoral and cellular

262

immune responses simultaneously. Several authors reported that in order to produce a desired

263

immune response, the epitopes must be accessible to both MHC I and MHC II molecules along

264

with the B-cell (Patra et al., 2019). Out of several viral proteins, S protein based vaccines and

265

antiviral therapies have been reported to be effective against the earlier encounters of SARS-

266

CoV and MERS-CoV infections (Du et al., 2009; Schindewolf and Menachery, 2019). With the

267

help of immunoinformatics approaches, we were able to identify 5 MHC I and 5 MHC II

268

epitopes with high antigenic potential and strong binding affinity within the S protein of 2019-

269

nCoV. Binding affinity of the selected epitopes was predicted against HLA A*1101 and

270

DRB1*0101 alleles, as these are the most common MHC class I and MHC class II alleles,

271

respectively in human population. Bhattacharya et al., (2020) also predicted and designed an

272

epitope based peptide vaccine against 2019-nCoV. However, our study revealed eight out of ten

273

completely different sets of epitopes with better Vaxijen scores i.e. > 1, which have not been

274

reported earlier.

275

For designing of a multi-epitope based vaccine construct, predicted epitopes were joined together

276

using different linkers for adequate separation of the epitopes. A suitable adjuvant was added at

277

the N-terminus end to boost the immunogenicity within the human body and 6x-His tag was

278

added to the C-terminus end for identification and purification purpose. The vaccine construct

279

was predicted as probable antigen, non-allergen and soluble in nature. So, the designed multi-

280

epitope vaccine have the potential to produce more effective, specific, robust, and durable

281

immune response without causing any adverse effect in humans.

282

Protparam analysis of the multi-epitope construct reveals the pI (theoretical isoelectric point)

283

value 9.66, which means the vaccine protein is basic in nature and most stable at this pH range.

284

Further, the aliphatic index 80.00 indicates thermostable nature of the construct at various

285

temperature and the instability index 25.48 (<40) shows that construct will remain stable after

286

expression. The Grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) value was computed to be negative

287

(-0.111), reveals that vaccine is hydrophilic in nature and likely to interact with other protein

288

molecules.

289

Further, the generated refined tertiary structure of vaccine construct was found valid for

290

identification of conformational epitopes and docking experiments. ProSA Z score showed the

291

overall quality score of the model protein, which fallen within the range characteristics of the

292

native protein. The PROCHECK Ramachandran plot used to find out energetically allowed and

293

disallowed psi (ψ) and phi () dihedral angles of amino acids, which was calculated based on

294

van der Waal radius of the side chain. Our modeled vaccine construct showed only less than

295

1.5% of the residues were present in disallowed regions of Ramachandran plot, indicating

296

negligible amount of steric clashes between the side chain atoms and main chain atoms. Again

297

ERRAT server was used to find out the pattern of non-bonded atomic interactions. The overall

298

quality factor (ERRAT score) was >50 i.e. 85.714, indicates the high quality model.

299

Further Discotope 2.0 identified 43 residues as conformational B-cell epitopes within the vaccine

300

construct. These epitopes can comes in a close contact to form a three dimensional conformation

301

due to protein folding, which can be identified by B-cells. Molecular docking study was carried

302

out to analyze the interaction between the vaccine construct and TLR3 receptor. The lowest

303

stabilized energy score by Cluspro 2.0 indicated strong and favorable interaction of our multi-

304

epitope vaccine construct with innate immune receptor, which can ultimately activate TLR and

305

augment the immune response against 2019-nCoV.

306

Conclusion

307

2019-nCoV is a new virus which become a serious Public Health Emergency of Global Concern.

308

Current study followed a reverse vaccinology approach to identify high ranked epitopes using an

309

immunoinformatics approach, to formulate a novel multi-epitope based vaccine construct to

310

prevent this disastrous outbreak. The designed vaccine construct has suitable structural,

311

physicochemical and immunological properties which can strongly stimulate both humoral and

312

cellular immune responses in humans. However, the proposed vaccine construct must be

313

validated through in-vitro and in-vivo bioassays to prove its safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity

314

against COVID-19.
