SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus that newly emerged in China in late 2019 1,2 and spread rapidly

13

worldwide, caused the first witnessed pandemic sparked by a coronavirus. As the pandemic

14

progresses, information about the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among humans is critical

15

to apply appropriate infection control measures and to slow its spread. Here we show that SARS-

16

CoV-2 is transmitted efficiently via direct contact and via the air (via respiratory droplets and/or

17

aerosols) between ferrets. Intranasal inoculation of donor ferrets resulted in a productive upper

18

respiratory tract infection and long-term shedding, up to 11 to 19 days post-inoculation. SARS-

19

CoV-2 transmitted to four out of four direct contact ferrets between 1 and 3 days after exposure

20

and via the air to three out of four independent indirect recipient ferrets between 3 and 7 days

21

after exposure. The pattern of virus shedding in the direct contact and indirect recipient ferrets

22

was similar to that of the inoculated ferrets and infectious virus was isolated from all positive

23

animals, showing that ferrets were productively infected via either route. This study provides

24

experimental evidence of robust transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via the air, supporting the

25

implementation of community-level social distancing measures currently applied in many

26

countries in the world and informing decisions on infection control measures in healthcare

27

settings 3.

29

In late December 2019, clusters of patients in China presenting with pneumonia of unknown etiology

30

were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) 1. The causative agent was rapidly identified

31

as being a virus from the Coronaviridae family, closely related to the severe acute respiratory

32

syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 2,4,5. The SARS-CoV epidemic affected 26 countries and resulted in

33

more than 8000 cases in 2003. The newly emerging coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 6, rapidly spread

34

worldwide and was declared pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020 7. The first evidence

35

suggesting human-to-human transmission came from the descriptions of clusters among the early

36

cases 8,9. Based on epidemiological data from China before measures were taken to control the

37

spread of the virus, the reproductive number R0 (the number of secondary cases directly generated

38

from each case) was estimated to be between 2 and 3 10-12. In order to apply appropriate infection

39

control measures to reduce the R0, the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 need to be elucidated.

40

Respiratory viruses can be transmitted via direct and indirect contact (via fomites), and through the

41

air via respiratory droplets and/or aerosols. Transmission via respiratory droplets (> 5 μm) is

42

mediated by expelled particles that have a propensity to settle quickly and is therefore reliant on

43

close proximity between infected and susceptible individuals, usually within 1 m of the site of

44

expulsion. Transmission via aerosols (< 5 μm) is mediated by expelled particles that are smaller in

45

size than respiratory droplets and can remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods of time,

46

allowing infection of susceptible individuals at a greater distance from the site of expulsion 13.

47

Current epidemiological data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted primarily via respiratory

48

droplets and contact 8-10,14,15, which is used as the basis for mitigation of spread through physical and

49

social distancing measures. However, scientific evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be efficiently

50

transmitted via the air is weak.

51

Previous studies have shown that ferrets were susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV 16-20, and that

52

SARS-CoV was efficiently transmitted to co-housed ferrets via direct contact 16. Here, we used a

53

ferret transmission model to assess whether SARS-CoV-2 spreads through direct contact and/or

54

through the air (via respiratory droplets and/or aerosols). For this purpose, individually housed

55

donor ferrets were inoculated intranasally with a strain of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a German

56

traveller returning from China. Six hours post-inoculation (hpi), a direct contact ferret was added to

57

each of the cages. The next day, indirect recipient ferrets were placed in adjacent cages, separated

58

from the donor cages by two steel grids, 10 cm apart, allowing viruses to be transmitted only via the

59

air (Supplementary Figure 1). On alternating days to prevent cross-contamination, throat, nasal and

60

rectal swabs were collected from each ferret in the inoculated and direct contact groups and from

61

the indirect recipient group, followed by SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR and virus titration.

62

Ferrets were productively infected by SARS-CoV-2 upon intranasal inoculation, as demonstrated by

63

the robust and long-term virus shedding from the donor ferrets (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 2).

64

SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels peaked at 3 days post-inoculation (dpi) and were detected up to 11 dpi in

65

two animals and up to 15 and 19 dpi in the other two animals (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 2).

66

SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted to direct contact ferrets in four out of four independent experiments

67

between 1 and 3 days post-exposure (dpe) and viral RNA was detected up to 13 to 15 days (i.e. 13 to

68

17 dpe) (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 2). Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 was also transmitted via the

69

air to three out of four indirect recipient ferrets. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected from 3 to 7 dpe

70

onwards these indirect recipient ferrets and for 13 to 19 days (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 2).

82

Whereas donor ferrets were inoculated with a high virus dose, direct contact and indirect recipient

83

ferrets are likely to have received a low infectious dose via direct contact or via the air. In spite of

84

this, the pattern of virus shedding from the direct contact and indirect recipient ferrets was similar

85

to that of the inoculated donor ferrets, both in terms of duration and SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels,

86

corroborating robust replication of SARS-CoV-2 upon transmission via direct contact and via the air,

87

independent of the infectious dose. In general, higher SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels were detected in the

88

throat swabs as compared to the nasal swabs. SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in the rectal swabs were

89

overall the lowest. From each SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive animal, infectious virus was isolated in

90

VeroE6 cells from throat and nasal swabs for at least two consecutive days (Supplementary Table 1).

91

In contrast, no infectious virus was isolated from the rectal swabs. Infectious virus titers ranged from

92

100,75 to 102,75 TCID50/ml (median tissue culture infectious dose per ml) in the donor ferrets, from

93

100,75 to 103,5 TCID50/ml in the direct contact ferrets and from 100,75 to 104,25 TCID50/ml in the indirect

94

recipient ferrets. All SARS-CoV-2 positive ferrets seroconverted 21 dpi/dpe, and the antibody levels

95

were similar in donor, direct contact and indirect recipient ferrets (Figure 2). The indirect recipient

96

ferret, in which no SARS-CoV-2 was detected, did not seroconvert as expected.

103
104

SARS-CoV-2 transmission in experimental animal models has recently also been described by others.

105

SARS-CoV-2 direct contact transmission between ferrets 21 and hamsters 22 was reported, with

106

similar efficiency as observed in our study. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 was also found to be transmitted

107

via the air in two out of six ferrets 21, and in two out of six cats 23. However, only low levels of SARS-

108

CoV-2 RNA were detected in nasal washes and feces of the indirect recipient ferrets, and no

109

infectious virus was isolated 21. Furthermore, virus shedding was shorter as compared to the donor

110

animals and only one out of the two SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive indirect recipient ferrets

111

seroconverted. Similarly, the transmission via the air between cats was not efficient. SARS-CoV-2

112

RNA was detected in the feces and tissues of one cat at 3 and 11 dpi respectively and in nasal

113

washes of another cat, but no infectious virus was isolated. Both SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive indirect

114

recipient cats seroconverted. In contrast, the present study showed that SARS-CoV-2 was efficiently

115

transmitted via the air between ferrets, as demonstrated by long-term virus shedding and the

116

presence of infectious virus in the indirect recipient animals, which is comparable to the

117

transmissibility of pandemic influenza viruses in the ferret model 24.

118

To date, there is no evidence of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. However, the

119

prolonged detection of RNA in consecutive stool samples 25 and the environmental contamination of

120

sanitary equipment 26 may suggest that the fecal-oral route could be a potential route of

121

transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Here, no infectious virus was retrieved from any of the rectal swabs.

122

Despite this, it cannot be fully excluded that SARS-CoV-2 was also transmitted from donors to direct

123

contact ferrets partly via the fecal-oral route. In the study by Kim et al., ferret fecal material was

124

used to inoculate ferrets, resulting in a productive infection, indicating that infectious SARS-CoV-2

125

was shed in fecal specimens 21.

126

Our experimental system does not allow to assess whether SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted via the air

127

through respiratory droplets, aerosols or both, as donor and indirect recipient ferret cages are

128

placed only 10 cm apart from each other. In a recent study, SARS-CoV-2 remained infectious in

129

aerosols for at least 3h after aerosolization at high titers in a rotating drum, comparable to SARS-CoV

130

27

131

study provides the additional information that infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles can actually be

132

expelled in the air and subsequently infect recipients. In two other studies, the presence of SARS-

133

CoV-2 in air samples collected in hospital settings was investigated. However, no SARS-CoV-2 RNA

134

was detected in the air sampled in three isolation rooms 26, or 10 cm from a symptomatic patient

135

who was breathing, coughing or speaking 28. Nevertheless, RNA was detected on the air exhaust

136

outlet of one of the isolation rooms in the first study, suggesting that virus-laden droplets may be

137

displaced by airflows 26.

138

Here we provide the first experimental evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted efficiently via

139

the air between ferrets, resulting in a productive infection and the detection of infectious virus in

140

indirect recipients, as a model for human-to-human transmission. Although additional experiments

141

on the relative contribution of respiratory droplets and aerosols to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2

142

are warranted, the results of this study corroborate the WHO recommendations about transmission

143

precautions in health care settings and the social distancing measures implemented in many

. Although it is informative to compare the stability of different respiratory viruses in the air, our

144

countries around the globe to mitigate the spread 3. The ferret transmission model will also be

145

useful to understand transmission dynamics and the molecular basis of the transmissibility of SARS-

146

Cov-2 and other betacoronaviruses, which, in the context of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and

147

future pandemic threats, is clearly of utmost importance.

Methods

231

Virus and cells

232

SARS-CoV-2 (isolate BetaCoV/Munich/BavPat1/2020; kindly provided by Prof. Dr. C. Drosten) was

233

propagated to passage 3 on VeroE6 cells (ATCC) in Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX (Gibco),

234

supplemented with penicillin (10,000 IU mL-1, Lonza) and streptomycin (10,000 IU mL -1, Lonza) at

235

37°C in a humidified CO2 incubator. VeroE6 cells were inoculated at an moi of 0.01. Supernatant was

236

harvested 72 hpi, cleared by centrifugation and stored at –80°C. VeroE6 cells were maintained in

237

DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (Greiner), 2 mM of L-glutamine (Gibco),

238

10 mM Hepes (Lonza), 1.5 mg ml−1 sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, Lonza), penicillin (10,000 IU/mL)

239

and streptomycin (10,000 IU/mL) at 37°C in a humidified CO2 incubator. All work was performed in a

240

Class II Biosafety Cabinet under BSL-3 conditions at the Erasmus Medical Center.

241

Ferret transmission experiment

242

All relevant ethical regulations for animal testing have been complied with. Animals were housed

243

and experiments were performed in strict compliance with the Dutch legislation for the protection

244

of animals used for scientific purposes (2014, implementing EU Directive 2010/63). Influenza virus,

245

SARS-CoV-2 and Aleutian Disease Virus seronegative 6 month-old female ferrets (Mustela putorius

246

furo), weighing 700–1000 g, were obtained from a commercial breeder (TripleF (USA)). Research was

247

conducted under a project license from the Dutch competent authority (license number

248

AVD1010020174312) and the study protocol was approved by the institutional Animal Welfare Body

249

(Erasmus MC permit number 17-4312-02). Animal welfare was monitored on a daily basis. Virus

250

inoculation of ferrets was performed under anesthesia with a mixture of ketamine/medetomidine

251

(10 and 0.05 mg kg−1 respectively) antagonized by atipamezole (0.25 mg kg−1). Swabs were taken

252

under light anesthesia using ketamine to minimize animal discomfort.

253

Four donor ferrets were inoculated intranasally with 6.105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 virus diluted in 500

254

μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (250 μl instilled dropwise in each nostril) and were housed

255

individually in a cage. Six hpi, direct contact ferrets were placed in the same cage as the donor

256

ferrets. One day later, indirect recipient ferrets were placed in an opposite cage separated by two

257

steel grids, 10 cm apart, to avoid contact transmission (Figure S1). Throat, nasal and rectal swabs

258

were collected from the animals every other day, to prevent cross-contamination, until they were

259

negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA or maximum for 21 dpi/dpe by determined by real-time RT-qPCR as

260

described below. Swabs were stored at −80 °C in transport medium (Minimum Essential Medium

261

Eagle with Hank's BSS (Lonza), 5 g L−1 lactalbumine enzymatic hydrolysate, 10% glycerol (Sigma-

262

Aldrich), 200 U ml−1 of penicillin, 200 mg ml−1 of streptomycin, 100 U ml−1 of polymyxin B sulfate

263

(Sigma-Aldrich), and 250 mg ml−1 of gentamicin (Life Technologies)) for end-point titration in VeroE6

264

cells as described below. Ferrets were euthanized at 21 dpi/dpe by heart puncture under

265

anaesthesia. Blood was collected in serum-separating tubes (Greiner) and processed according to

266

the manufacturer’s instructions. Sera were heated for 1h at 60 oC and used for the detection of

267

specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as described below. All animal experiments were performed

268

in class III isolators in a negatively pressurized ABSL3+ facility.

269

RNA isolation and RT-qPCR

270

RNA was isolated using an in-housed developed high-throughput method in a 96-well format. Sixty

271

μl of sample were added to 90 μl of MagNA Pure 96 External Lysis Buffer (Roche). A known

272

concentration of phocine distemper virus (PDV) was added to the sample as internal control for the

273

RNA extraction 29. The 150 μl of sample/lysis buffer was added to a well of a 96-well plate containing

274

50 μl of magnetic beads (AMPure XP, Beckman Coulter). After thorough mixing by pipetting up and

275

down at least 10 times, the plate was incubated for 15 minutes (min) at room temperature. The

276

plate was then placed on a magnetic block (DynaMag™-96 Side Skirted Magnet

277

(ThermoFisher Scientific)) and incubated for 3 min to allow the displacement of the beads towards

278

the side of the magnet. Supernatants were carefully removed without touching the beads and beads

279

were washed three times for 30 seconds (sec) at room temperature with 200 μl/well of 70% ethanol.

280

After the last wash, a 10 μl multi-channel pipet was used to remove residual ethanol. Plates were

281

air-dried for 6 min at room temperature. Plates were removed from the magnetic block and 30 μl of

282

PCR grade water was added to each well and mixed by pipetting up and down 10 times. Plates were

283

incubated for 5 min at room temperature and then placed back on the magnetic block for 2 min to

284

allow separation of the beads. Supernatants were pipetted in a new plate and RNA was kept at 4oC.

285

The RNA was directly used for RT-qPCR using primers and probes targeting the E gene of SARS-CoV-2

286

as previously described 30. The primers and probe for PDV detection were described previously 29.

287

Virus titrations

288

Throat, nasal and rectal swabs were titrated in quadruplicates in VeroE6 cells. Briefly, confluent

289

VeroE6 cells were inoculated with 10-fold serial dilutions of sample in Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX,

290

supplemented with penicillin (10,000 IU mL-1), streptomycin (10,000 IU mL-1). At one hpi, the first

291

three dilutions were washed twice with media and fresh media was subsequently added to the

292

whole plate. At six dpi, virus positivity was assessed by reading out cytopathic effects. Infectious

293

virus titers (TCID50/ml) were calculated from four replicates of each throat, nasal and rectal swabs

294

and from 24 replicates of the virus stock using the Spearman-Karber method.

295

Serology

296

Sera were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a receptor binding domain (RBD) enzyme-linked

297

immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described previously, with some modifications 31. Briefly, ELISA

298

plates were coated overnight with either SARS-CoV-2 RBD. After blocking, sera were added and

299

incubated for 1h at 37oC. Bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-

300

labelled goat anti-ferret IgG (Abcam) and 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Life Technologies) as

301

a substrate. The absorbance of each sample was measured at 450 nm.
