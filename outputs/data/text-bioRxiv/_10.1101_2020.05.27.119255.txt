Abstract

22

In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the development and validation of rapid and easy-to-

23

perform diagnostic methods are of high priority. We compared the performance of four rapid

24

antigen detection tests for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples. Immunochromatographic SARS-

25

CoV-2 assays from RapiGEN, Liming bio, Savant, and Bioeasy were evaluated using universal

26

transport medium containing naso-oropharyngeal swabs from suspected Covid-19 cases. The

27

diagnostic accuracy was determined in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. A total of 111

28

samples were included; 80 were RT-PCR positive. Median patients’ age was 40 years, 55% were

29

female, and 88% presented within the first week after symptom onset. The evaluation of the

30

Liming bio assay was discontinued due to insufficient performance. The overall sensitivity

31

values of RapiGEN, Liming bio, and Bioeasy tests were 62.0% (CI95% 51.0–71.9), 16.7%

32

(CI95% 10.0–26.5), and 85.0% (CI95% 75.6–91.2), respectively, with specificities of 100%.

33

Sensitivity was significantly higher in samples with high viral loads (RapiGEN, 84.9%; Bioeasy,

34

100%). The study highlighted the significant heterogeneity of test performance among evaluated

35

assays, which might have been influenced by the use of a non-validated sample material. The

36

high sensitivity of some tests demonstrated that rapid antigen detection has the potential to serve

37

as an alternative diagnostic method, especially in patients presenting with high viral loads in

38

early phases of infection. This is particularly important in situations with limited access to RT-

39

PCR or prolonged turnaround time. Further comparative evaluations are necessary to select

40

products with high performance among the growing market of diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

46

Since its emergence in 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused tremendous public

47

health challenges worldwide (1). Early detection of cases is essential to help curtail this

48

unprecedented pandemic; thus, rapid and easy-to-perform diagnostic tools that can be used to test

49

large numbers of samples in a short period of time are crucial (2). To date, the recommended

50

diagnostic method for SARS-CoV-2 infection (known as Covid-19) is real-time reverse-

51

transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which was introduced in January 2020 (3),

52

and is now performed using WHO or CDC protocols (4, 5), as well as various commercial assays

53

(6).

54

The gap between the number of samples and the capacity to perform RT-PCR in a timely

55

manner is considered a mayor limitation of public health containment strategies (7). Therefore,

56

there is a critical demand for alternative assays, especially rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which

57

are timely, easy to perform, and can serve for point-of-care testing (POCT) or community-based

58

testing (8). RDTs for antibody detection have been developed, but due to the delay in humoral

59

immune response, they have limited use for early diagnosis and low sensitivity for community-

60

based screening (9, 10). Antigen detection tests, on the other hand, have the advantage of

61

detecting the presence of the virus itself and might therefore be a better tool for early cases, but

62

require sufficient viral loads and high-quality sampling (11). Although SARS-CoV-2-specific

63

antigen testing has only recently been developed (12); the market pressure generated by this

64

unprecedented pandemic has resulted in many novel assays that are now commercially available

65

(13). Unfortunately, scientific literature supporting their accuracy is scarce and real-world

66

performance of these assays is uncertain; their validation and comparison are therefore of high

67

priority (12, 14). Here we present a head-to-head comparison and evaluation of four novel

68

antigen-based RDTs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens from suspected

69

Covid-19 cases.

70
71
72

Material and Methods
We conducted a head-to-head study of the diagnostic accuracy of four rapid SARS-CoV-

73

2 antigen detection tests compared to RT-PCR. Samples derived from patients with respiratory

74

symptoms and/or fever, attending Clínica Alemana, a private medical center in Santiago, Chile,10

75

between March 16 and April 26, 2020. Specimens were obtained by trained personnel in a

76

specially dedicated “Respiratory Emergency Room” and consisted of naso-oropharyngeal (NOP)

77

swabs, which were placed in tubes with 3 mL universal transport medium (UTM-RT® System,

78

Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA, USA). Samples were initially examined for SARS-CoV-2

79

RNA by COVID-19 Genesig® Real-Time PCR assay (Primerdesign Ltd., Chander´s Ford, UK)

80

after RNA extraction with the Magna Pure Compact system (Roche Molecular Systems Inc.,

81

Pleasanton, Ca, USA) or using a manual protocol with the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid kit

82

(Roche Molecular Systems Inc., Mannheim, Germany). The Primerdesign RT-PCR received

83

FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and is within the WHO Emergency Use Listing

84

(EUL) tests eligible for procurement. The test kit includes a positive control template of the

85

target gene and a RNA internal extraction control. It targets the RNA-dependent RNA

86

polymerase (RdRp) with a detection limit of 0.58 copies/µL, according to the manufacturer.

87

Samples showing an exponential amplification curve and a cycle threshold (Ct) value ≤40 were

88

considered as positive.

89

PCR-characterized samples (UTM with swabs) were kept at -80° C and tested on April

90

28 and 29 by the following lateral flow antigen-detection kits: 1) “Biocredit COVID-19 Ag One

91

Step SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test” (RapiGEN Inc., Anyang-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea),

92

2) “COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Device StrongStep® COVID-19 Antigen Test” (Liming Bio-

93

Products Co., Jiangsu, China; 3) “Huaketai New Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) N Protein

94

Detection Kit (Fluorescence immunochromatography)” (Savant Biotechnology Co., Beijing,

95

China), and 4) “Diagnostic Kit for 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Ag Test (Fluorescence

96

Immunochromatographic Assay)” (Bioeasy Biotechnology Co., Shenzhen, China). All kits have

97

a cassette format and display test and control lines, permitting a rapid use without positive and

98

negative control specimens (Table 1). Tests must be read after a specific incubation period (5 to

99

15 minutes). The first two assays use colloid gold conjugated antibodies, resulting in visible

100

colored bands, whereas the latter two kits are based on fluorescein-marked antibodies. For the

101

Savant assay we used a UV flashlight provided by the manufacturer for visual readout, while the

102

Bioeasy kit was automatically read by the immunofluorescence analyzer EASY-11 (Bioeasy

103

Biotechnology Co.).

104

Importantly, our evaluation protocol included a deviation from the manufacturer´s instructions.

105

Instead of using the provided test solution, we used the equivalent volume of UTM, as described

106

in other studies (15-17). This method allowed us to compare all four assays using the same

107

specimens and to rapidly evaluate a large number of samples previously characterized by RT-

108

PCR.

109

Positive and negative samples were selected by convenience among the 5,276 respiratory

110

specimens processed for SARS-CoV-2 in the clinical laboratory during the study period. Due to

111

the shortage of available test kits, a 2:1 distribution of positive to negative samples was chosen.

112

Seventeen of the positive specimens had been used in a previous evaluation of the Bioeasy RDT

113

by our group (15). Assays were tested in parallel from the same sample and by the same trained

114

technician, who was blinded to the RT-PCR results. All test procedures, except the reading of the

115

cassette, were performed under a BSL2 cabinet. Assays with visual output were read by two

116

independent observers, who conferred with a third observer in case of disagreement. Results of

117

the RDTs were compared to those of RT-PCR as reference method; for samples with discordant

118

result, tests were repeated. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from the mandatory

119

Covid-19 notification forms and analyzed in an anonymized manner. Samples with high viral

120

loads (defined as Ct value <25) were compared to those with low viral load (Ct values >25) (16).

121

Statistical analyses were performed with OpenEpi (version 3.01) and GraphPad Prism (version

122

8.4.2).

123

All materials and personnel for this evaluation except the test from Savant Biotechnology

124

Co. were purchased using funds for routine diagnostics of the Clinical Laboratory of Clínica

125

Alemana; the Savant RDT was provided free-of-charge by the manufacturer. The study was

126

approved by the respective institutional review board (Comité Etico Científico, Facultad de

127

Medicina Clínica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile) and need for informed

128

consent was waived.

131

Results
The study included a total of 111 samples from symptomatic patients; 55% were female,

132

with a median age of 40 years, which was similar to the population of all patients tested for

133

Covid-19 in our laboratory during the study period (57% female, median age 38 years). Eighty of

134

the tested specimens were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, which represented 22% of all

135

positives during the study period, while 31 samples were RT-PCR negative. The median duration

136

from symptom onset to sampling was 2 days (IQR 1-5 days); 88% of specimens (96/109;

137

missing data, n=2) were taken during the first week of symptoms. Ct values ranged from 10.7 to

138

37.7 (mean, 22.5).

139

While all four tests were user-friendly, test performances showed significant differences

140

(Table 2). The evaluation of the Liming bio kit was stopped after 19 samples, due to its poor

141

results with a sensitivity of 0% (0/9), specificity of 90% (9/10), and a Kappa coefficient of -0.1.

142

Sensitivities of the other three assays ranged from 16.7% for the Savant test to 85% for Bioeasy

143

(Table 2). Similarly, Bioeasy had the highest accuracy (89.2%) and Kappa coefficient (0.8). All

144

three assays had a specificity of 100% and proved robust; invalid results occurred only with

145

RapiGen (n=2) and Savant (n=2) due to insufficient liquid migration.

146

In addition, we correlated the viral loads of samples with true positive and false negative

147

results. As shown in Figure 1, mean Ct values of false negative samples were significantly higher

148

than in true positives samples in all three tests. RapiGen and Bioeasy mainly missed to detect

149

samples with high viral load (Ct values >25); this threshold was less clear for the Savant assay.

150

Accordingly, sensitivity values of RapiGen and Bioeasy differed significantly among subgroups

151

with high viral loads and low viral loads (Ct >25) (Figure 2). Indeed, the two assays identified

152

84.9% and 100% of specimens with high viral load, but only 15.4% and 53.8% of those with low

153

viral load, respectively. In case of the Savant assay, although the difference in sensitivity among

154

samples with high and low viral loads remained, it was far less striking (21.2% vs. 7.7%,

155

respectively) (Figure 2). RapiGen and Bioeasy had a concordance of 82%, while agreement

156

between these two tests and Savant was 67% and 50%, respectively. As visualized in Figure 3,

157

all samples identified as positive by RapiGen or Savant were also detected by Bioeasy.

158

Moreover, the latter platform identified various additional positive samples, especially among

159

those with lower viral loads (Ct 22-30) and it was the only test to detect specimens with very low

160

viral loads (Ct >30).

161

All four tests were incubated on a flat surface at room temperature and delivered results

162

in short time (5 to 15 minutes). The visual readout of RapiGen was clear, regardless of the

163

intensity of the band, due to its dual colored format in which the control band was red and

164

positive results appeared as black lines. The visual interpretation of the fluorescence Savant

165

assay was difficult under daylight conditions. This test might perform differently with its reader,

166

which was not available in Chile. Bioeasy had a user-friendly readout performed by a desktop

167

instrument that interpreted the cassettes in <1 minute. The instrument included options for saving

168

patient results, QR coding, and printing, and is suitable to be connected to a laboratory

169

information system.

170
171
172

Discussion
The evaluated assays are among the 22 antigen detection tests for SARS-CoV-2 available

173

at the time of writing, of which 14 are commercialized with CE (Conformité Européene)

174

marking (13). However, it is important to note that the CE licencing process is based on self-

175

reporting of manufacturers, does not grant high performance, and can be misused (18, 19).

176

Indeed, the challenge and problems presented by this procedure has recently been addressed by

177

the European Commission in light of the evolving Covid-19 pandemic (12). The emerging

178

marketing and use of novel PCR-independent tests in the absence of robust performance data has

179

been criticized and it has the potential to cause more damage than benefit (20, 21). Independent

180

evaluations of such diagnostic assays are therefore urgently needed, with larger comparative

181

studies for antibody tests only recently available or under way (22, 23). Antigen-based testing is

182

still in its infancy and evaluations are scarce (12). Up to now, we only found four publications

183

available (three peer-reviewed), evaluating two assays (15-17, 24), while comparative studies are

184

lacking.

185

Sensitivity is the most important performance parameter of SARS-CoV-2 antigen

186

detection (12). However, it is also considered the main limiting factor due to experiences with

187

influenza and RSV lateral flow detection kits (6, 25). Newer biosensor-based methods to detect

188

SARS-CoV-2 antigen have shown promising results and could offer a highly sensitive alternative

189

for rapid diagnosis in the future (26, 27).

190

Our comparison detected significant performance heterogeneity among the evaluated kits.

191

The Bioeasy assay had the highest sensitivity, which was in accordance with our previous

192

evaluation (15). The here reported sensitivity (85%) was almost identical to the value reported by

193

the manufacturer (85.5%). A study from China (with participation of the manufacturer) found an

194

overall sensitivity of 68%; however, for samples with Ct values ≤30, the sensitivity increased to

195

98% (24). This excellent identification rate in specimens with high viral loads (Ct <25) was

196

confirmed in this report and our recently published study (15). The RapiGen test also showed an

197

acceptable sensitivity (84.9%) with high viral load samples, but was much less sensitive (15.4%)

198

when the viral burden was low. This test had a visual readout, which might have contributed to

199

lower sensitivity. Another assay with visual bands (Respi-Strip CORIS) was recently evaluated

200

in two European studies. Overall sensitivity ranged from 50% to 57.6%; however, detection rates

201

improved for samples with high viral loads (Ct <25) reaching sensitivities of 73.9% to 82.2%

202

(16, 17). The other two assays evaluated by us showed an insufficient performance. Savant had

203

an overall sensitivity of 16.7%, which did not increase significantly in high viral load samples

204

(Figure 2), while the Liming bio assay did not detect any of 10 positives and was not further

205

evaluated.

206

All four tests had a cassette format; two had visual readout and two were based on

207

immunofluorescence, one of which required an automated reader. In our experience, all systems

208

were easy to use, robust, and gave a qualitative result in short time (10-20 minutes). The

209

fluorescence reader eased interpretation, but it required a higher standard including technical

210

support. The user-friendliness of all tests demonstrated their potential for decentralized

211

screening. However, the application as POCT is hampered by the inherent biological hazard of

212

respiratory specimens, which require processing in a biosafety cabinet (28). This problem could

213

be overcome if extraction buffers or solutions with virus inactivating properties are used.

214

The enormous performance gaps detected in our study highlight the urgent need of

215

comparative studies of commercialized antigen tests (12). A possible explanation of performance

216

variations might be related to differences in protein targets. However, details on the detection

217

system (target antigen and detecting antibody) are only reported by a minority of manufacturers

218

(29). The methodology of using specimens stored in UTM for evaluation purposes is another

219

critical point with advantages and disadvantages (15), which should be systematically validated,

220

e.g. with spiked samples.

221

Performance data are critical for local decision making and also for global agencies in the

222

procurement of simpler, scalable diagnostic tests. Although these tests are less sensitive than RT-

223

PCR, they might be useful during outbreak situations, when timely results are important, but

224

access to molecular testing is limited (14). As shown in this and other reports, antigen tests are

225

more reliable in samples with high viral loads, which usually occur during the first days of

226

clinical disease (30-32). In our population, for example, 96% of high viral load specimens

227

derived from patients in their first week of symptoms. Accordingly, the sensitivities for first

228

week samples reached 91%- 95% (Bioeasy) in this and previous studies (15). Interestingly, a

229

similar value (94%) was reported for SARS-CoV antigen detection during the first 5 days of

230

disease in a publication from 2004 (33).

231

The potential to detect early infections might be crucial for the design of new RDT-based

232

algorithms, which are particularly important in weaker health systems and low resource settings

233

such as Latin America and Africa. Possible frontline applications include community-based

234

testing, e.g. in drive-through test stations, and at-home self-testing (34). However, in light of the

235

imperfection of tests, large scale strategies need to be well designed to avoid negative effects

236

(35). Another application might be as an adjunct to RT-PCR to achieve rapid preliminary results,

237

e.g. for healthcare workers.

238

A limitation regarding the evaluation of specificity was the low number of negative

239

samples and that the study was performed during a season with reduced circulation of other

240

respiratory viruses.

241

In conclusion, our comparative study highlighted a significant heterogeneity of test

242

performance. The high sensitivity of some tests demonstrated that antigen detection has the

243

potential to serve as an alternative or adjunct diagnostic method to RT-PCR, especially in

244

patients presenting with high viral loads in early phases of infection. This might be of particular

245

importance in situations with limited access to RT-PCR or prolonged turnaround time. Further

246

comparative evaluations are necessary to select for tests with high performance among the

247

growing market of diagnostics for Covid-19.
