ABSTRACT
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been proposed in the treatment of SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
infection, albeit with much controversy. In vitro, HCQ effectively inhibits viral entry, but its use in the clinic has
been hampered by conflicting results. A better understanding of HCQ’s mechanism of actions in vitro is
needed to resolve these conflicts. Recently, anesthetics were shown to disrupt ordered
monosialotetrahexosylganglioside1 (GM1) lipid rafts. These same lipid rafts recruit the SARS-CoV-2 surface
receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to an endocytic entry point, away from phosphatidylinositol
4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) domains. Here we employed super resolution imaging of cultured mammalian cells
to show HCQ directly perturbs GM1 lipid rafts and inhibits the ability of ACE2 receptor to associate with the
endocytic pathway. HCQ also disrupts PIP2 domains and their ability to cluster and sequester ACE2. Similarly,
the antibiotic erythromycin inhibits viral entry and both HCQ and erythromycin decrease the antimicrobial host
defense peptide amyloid beta in cultured cells. We conclude HCQ is an anesthetic-like compound that disrupts
GM1 lipid rafts similar to anesthetics. The disruption likely decreases viral clustering at both endocytic and
putative PIP2 entry points.
KEY POINTS
Question: What is the molecular basis for antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine?
Findings: Hydroxychloroquine disrupt lipid rafts similar to general anesthetics.
Meaning: Since lipids cluster ACE2 and facilitate viral entry, hydroxychloroquine appears to inhibit viral entry
by disrupting the lipid clustering of the SARS-CoV2 receptor.

Interestingly, CQ is an anesthetic—subcutaneous
injection of CQ produces instant local anesthesia
sufficient to perform a surgical procedure24 25 and
structurally CQ is strikingly similar to a local
anesthetic (Fig. 1A). Both CQ and local anesthetics
such as tetracaine are weak bases and their
uptake changes the acid base balance within the
membrane26 27. Additionally, common local
anesthetics such as mepivacaine, bupivacaine,
tetracaine and other lipid raft disrupting
compounds, such as sterols and cyclodextrin, can
exert anti-viral or anti-microbial activity28–31.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), a viral
infection caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), recently
emerged as a serious public health problem1 2.
Currently, millions of people have been infected
with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. Proposed treatments
for severe symptoms include a well-known FDA
approved antimalarial agents chloroquine (CQ)
and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 3–7,
but their mechanism of action are poorly
understood in COVID19 and their proven antiviral
effects are largely limited to in vitro studies. A
retrospective study claimed a benefit in particular
with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin8, but
their use is not without controversy9 10, and
randomized control studies without an antibiotic
appeared to have no benefit11. In the treatment of
malaria, CQ targets the replication cycle of the
parasite12, a mechanism of action presumably
unrelated to their action in COVID19.
Understanding the underlying in vitro mechanism
for these compounds in COVID19 could help in
designing efficacious clinical trials and bettering
the translation of their use in the clinic.

These properties led us to compare the drugs’ lipid
disruption properties with viral entry and potentially
understand a component of their underlying
molecular mechanism. Understanding CQ’s
mechanism of action could help understanding
potential contradictions and determining which
cellular and animal models are appropriate for
testing CQ’s effect in vitro and in vivo.

We have shown a cholesterol-dependent
mechanism for anesthetics that regulates the
movement of membrane proteins between
monosialotetrahexosylganglioside1
(GM1)
containing lipid rafts and PIP2 lipid domains13 14.
The GM1 rafts are formed by cholesterol packing15
and the PIP2 domains are formed from charged
protein clustering16 (Fig. S1A). In cellular
membranes, local and general anesthetics,
including propofol, disrupt GM1 rafts13 17. The
anesthetic propofol also has various beneficial
effects on COVID19 treatment and the FDA
recently permitted the emergency use of Fresenius
Propoven 2% emulsion to maintain sedation via
continuous infusion for COVID-19 patients18.

Cholesterol is critical to both viral entry and
immune responses19. We recently showed the
SARS-CoV-2 surface receptor, angiotensinogen
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)20–22 moves between
GM1 rafts and PIP2 domains in a cholesterol
dependent manner23. In an obese mouse model,
cholesterol was high in lung tissue and this
correlated with ACE2 movement to endocytic
lipids, a condition that accelerated viral entry into
the target cells in cell culture23.

greatest effect with almost a 90% reduction in
SARS2-PV luciferase activity (Fig. 1B).
Since COVID19 is often severe in obese patients,
we also tested HCQ inhibition in cells loaded with
cholesterol. To load cells with cholesterol, we
treated HEK293T cells overexpressing ACE2
receptor with 4 µM apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and
10% fetal bovine serum. ApoE is a cholesterol
carrier protein linked to the severity of COVID1934.
In tissue, ApoE binds to low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) receptor and facilitates loading of cholesterol
into cells35 (Fig. S1B). When apoE is in excess in
low cholesterol conditions, it facilitates efflux of
cholesterol from the cell35. To provide a source of
cholesterol to the apoE, we added 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), a common source of cholesterol
~310 µg/mL. Importantly, apoE is not present in
FBS36 allowing us to carefully control cholesterol
loading. Cells were treated acutely (1 hr.) prior to
viral infection. We adapted cholesterol loading
from our previous studies in primary neurons 37.

RESULTS
Inhibition of SARS-CoV2 entry by anestheticlike compounds.
In order to test SARS-CoV2 viral entry, we
expressed a retrovirus pseudotyped with the
SARS2 spike protein (SARS2-PV) in HEK 293T
cells. A segment of the spike protein binds to ACE2
and recapitulates viral entry32 33. A luciferase
encoded in the pseudotyped virus allows
quantitative measurement of viral entry.
Treatments with propofol, tetracaine, and HCQ all
robustly reduced SARS2-PV entry into HEK293T
cells overexpressing ACE2 receptor (Fig. 1B).
The cells were first treated with drug (50 µM) and
then the drug was removed, after which SARS2PV was applied (i.e., the virus did not experience
the drug directly, only the cells). HCQ had the

increased viral entry by ~50% (p value <0.05) with
endogenously expressed ACE223. Control cells in
ACE2 overexpressed cell line were highly variable
in viral infection, reducing statistical significance.
Nonetheless, as expected, treatment of cholesterol
loaded cells with HCQ and tetracaine reduced
SARS2-PV entry in high cholesterol. The efficacy
with cholesterol was slightly less compared to noncholesterol loaded cells.

HCQ acts in an anesthetic pathway by
disrupting lipid rafts.
Based on the structural similarities of HCQ with
anesthetics (Fig. 1A), we investigated HCQ’s
ability to work through an anesthetic-like
mechanism. We recently showed a mechanism of
anesthesia based on disruption of lipid rafts.
Anesthetics perturb rafts in two ways. First,
anesthetics increase the apparent size and
number of lipid rafts as observed using super
resolution imaging and cluster analysis13 17.
Second, anesthetics can disassociate cholesterol
sensitive proteins from GM1 rafts. The
disassociation of a proteins from a GM1 raft can
also be measured with super resolution imaging
using two-color fluorescent labeling and pair
correlation analysis. The results of pair correlation
are quantitative, well established, and provide
mechanistic insights into raft associated signaling
and protein movement at nanoscale distances13 17.
To test HCQ’s effects on lipid membranes, we first
examined the effect of HCQ on the apparent
structure (size and number) of GM1 rafts by direct
stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy
(dSTORM) in the membranes of HEK293T cells
using density-based spatial clustering of
applications with noise (DBSCAN). We found 50
µM HCQ, a minimum saturating concentration that
was shown to inhibit viral entry3, increased the
number and apparent size (Fig. 2A-C) of GM1
rafts. HCQ’s perturbation was very similar to that
previously seen for general anesthetics chloroform
and isofluorane13 (Fig. 2A). We also observed
Ripley’s H(r) of GM1 clusters decreased after HCQ
treatment (Fig. S2A), suggesting a decrease in
domain separation. Methyl-beta cyclodextrin
(MβCD), a chemical known to deplete GM1 rafts
from the cell membrane, decreased both the
number and apparent size of GM1 clusters (Fig.
2A-B).

labeled ACE2 and PIP2 domains in HEK293T cells
at normal cholesterol levels and treated the cells
with and without 50 µM HCQ. Figure 2D shows
representative figures of dSTORM imaging.
Somewhat unexpected, the pair correlation
between ACE2 and PIP2 domains clearly
decreased with HCQ treatment (Fig. 2E),
suggesting HCQ disrupts ACE2 association with
both GM1 rafts and PIP2 domains.

We found 50 µM HCQ robustly disrupted PLD2
localization with GM1 rafts (Fig. 2D-E).
Quantification of the % pair correlation at short
radiuses (0-5 nm) decreased by almost 70% (Fig.
2F). Hence HCQ’s effect on the lipid membrane is
clearly similar to general anesthetics (Fig. 2A)
where the domains are larger but the ability to
retain a palmitoylated protein is inhibited. We
attempted to confirm HCQ disruption of lipid rafts
in a live-cell PLD2 activity, however HCQ appeared
to directly inhibit enzymatic activity (Fig. S2B-C)
precluding the assays usefulness. Nonetheless,
HCQ’s displacement of PLD2 observed by super
resolution imaging led us to consider displacement
of the ACE2 receptor.

We further characterized the nature of the PIP2
disruption by analyzing the structures of the PIP2
domains before and after HCQ treatment using
dSTORM cluster analysis. Figure 2D shows
representative dSTORM images comparing PIP2
domains before and after HCQ treatment. HCQ
treatment decreased both the number and size of
PIP2 domains by ~ 25% and 50% respectively (Fig.
S3B-C) confirming HCQ directly perturbs the
domains.

HCQ disrupts clustering of ACE2 with GM1
rafts.
The ability of a virus to cluster is important for its
infectivity and maturation39–42. For SARS-CoV2
entry depends on binding to ACE2. ACE2 localizes
to both GM1 rafts and PIP2 domains, however in
high cholesterol (obese animals) ACE2 is in GM1
rafts23. To recapitulate a physiologically relevant
environment of an obese patients, we loaded
HEK293T cells with cholesterol using apoE and
serum identical to the treatment in Figure 123. The
cells were then fixed, labeled them with anti-ACE2
antibody and CTxB, and imaged using two color
dSTORM.
After 50 µM HCQ treatment, we found ACE2
receptor dramatically decreased its association
with GM1 rafts, despite the increase in GM1 raft
size and number (Fig 3A). Pair correlation was
decreased at all distances (Fig. S3A). At short
distances (0-5 nm) the decreased was almost 50%
(p<0.05) (Fig. 3B) confirming HCQ disrupts the
ability of GM1 rafts to sequester ACE2 as expected
from its anesthetic-like mechanism of action and its
effect on PLD2.

HCQ disrupts PIP2 domains
We have previously shown that disrupting GM1
rafts moves ACE2 to and clusters with PIP2
domains23. We presume PIP2 domains reside in the
disordered regions away from GM1 rafts due to the
large amount of unsaturation in PIP2’s acyl chains43
44
. To determine whether ACE2 clusters with PIP2
domains after disruption of GM1 rafts, we co-

shows nanoscale lipid heterogeneity. Saturated monosialotetrahexosylganglioside1 (GM1) lipid rafts (dark grey) attract
ACE2 (yellow oval) in high cholesterol (top). In low or normal cholesterol, ACE2 associates primarily with
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ, orange hexagon) disrupts the lipid order and
excludes the association of ACE2 from both GM1 rafts and PIP2 domains (right panel). The SARS-CoV-2 virus (white
circle with red spike) binds to the ACE2 receptor. The location of the ACE2 receptor dictates the location and efficacy of
viral entry.

Erythromycin inhibits viral entry through
perturbing GM1 rafts

HCQ’s disruption on host defense peptides.
Lastly, we considered HCQ effect on host defense
peptides. Host defense peptides are amphipathic
antimicrobial peptides that are upregulated during
an immune response and perturb the membranes
of microbes49 50. Cholesterol and raft integrity are of
great importance to the modulation of both innate
and acquired immune responses51. Amyloid-beta
(Ab) has been demonstrated to protect against
microbial infection as a host defense peptide and
the production of Ab is regulated by lipid raft
integrity37 52 (Fig. S1D). We hypothesized that if
HCQ disrupts lipids, it may disrupt the production
of host defense peptides. Disrupting host defense
peptides would be an unwanted effect that would
need to be considered when treating COVID19
patients.

Azithromycin, an antibiotic derived from
erythromycin, has been given to COVID-19
patients in combination with HCQ and was shown
to significantly reduce COVID-19 associated
mortality8. Erythromycin has shown
antiviral
properties in numerous studies45–48. Many
antimicrobials are also thought to disrupt GM1
rafts. Based on the cholesterol sensitivity of SARSCoV2 we reasoned erythromycin could contribute
to an antiviral effect through raft disruption leading
us to test its effect on SARS2-PV.
We found erythromycin (100 µg/mL) inhibited
SARS2-PV infection ~70% in HEK293T cells over
expressing ACE2 at normal cholesterol levels (Fig.
3A). Consistent with disruption, the same
treatment increased membrane fluidity ~ 60% (Fig.
4B). Furthermore, using PLD2 activity as a
surrogate for an effect in live cells showed an ~10%
increase (Fig. 4C), consistent with raft disruption.
Unexpectedly, when we increased the cholesterol
level using apoE and serum, erythromycin was no
longer effective. In fact, when we examined the pair
correlation of ACE2 and GM1 correlation we saw
increased association of ACE2 with GM1 (Fig.
S3D-E). This suggests the effect of erythromycin
on viral entry may be bimodal and depend on the
progression of the disease. If HCQ reverses the
effects of cholesterol on disruption this may explain
some of the proposed combined benefit of HCQ
with erythromycin.

To investigate the role of HCQ and anestheticsinduced raft perturbation in the synthesis of host
defense peptides, we measured Ab production
using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA). We found that HCQ reduced Ab
generation ~ 10% in cultured HEK293T cells (Fig.
4D). The effect was statistically significant
(p<0.05). We then loaded HEK293T cells with
cholesterol (apoE + serum) to better reflect the
disease state of COVID-19 with severe symptoms.
The reduction of Ab was ~20% greater in high
cholesterol. Since tetracaine and propofol also
disrupt GM1 rafts, we tested their effect on Ab
production and found it to be very similar in both
high
and
low
cholesterol.
Interestingly,
erythromycin did disrupt Ab production in low

cholesterol, but in high cholesterol the effect was
very small and not statistically significant.

When cholesterol is low, HCQ likely has a reduced
effect, i.e., the drug likely fails to reverse high
cholesterol in the absence of high cholesterol.
Hence, animal and cultured cell experiments in low
cholesterol likely fail to capture the full benefit of
HCQ and should be carefully scrutinized. For
example, lungs cell and monkey’s showed no
reduced effect from HCQ were performed without
high cholesterol, but this reflects the physiological
state of a child or healthy adult, does not reflect an
obese patient at risk for death from severe
COVID19 symptoms54 55. Over expressing a
protease that primes the virus appears to
overcome the antiviral properties of HCQ54. Our
data suggests this is due to viral priming in the
disordered region due to very high concentrations
of the protease. Further studies are need to
determine if the virus can be cleaved and enter a
cell while in the disordered region with
physiological levels of protease.

Discussion
Taken together our finding shows a component of
HCQ acts through anesthetic-like mechanism that
disrupts ACE2 localization at both GM1 rafts and
PIP2 domains. Presumably the disruption of ACE2
clustering decreases the ability of the virus to
cluster and enter the cell. Figure 5 shows a
propose a model of HCQ disrupting SARS-CoV-2
viral entry through raft perturbation. In an
inflamed state, cholesterol traffics ACE2 from
PIP2 domains to GM1 rafts where virions dock
and enter through endocytic pathway. The
perturbation of both GM1 rafts and PIP2 domains
by HCQ likely inhibits viral entry by making it more
difficult to cluster ACE2 and enter the endocytic
entry point. The mechanism of surface receptor
clustering was recently shown to be important to
the related influenza virus39. How the molecular
studies related to the clinic will need to be studied.

HCQ anesthetic-like properties are likely enhanced
by its positively charged amine. HCQ appears to
interact directly with PIP2 to block ACE2
localization with PIP2. It is unclear where ACE2
resides when it is excluded from both GM1 rafts
and PIP2 domains. Presumably it moves into a
generic disordered region of the cell membrane.
Alternatively, it may move into PIP3 domains. PIP3
is typically short chain saturated43 44 and could
possibly attract ACE2 if HCQ preferentially disrupts
long chain polyunsaturated lipids such as PIP2.

In part, HCQ counteracts cholesterol. The immune
system uses cholesterol as a signal to fight
infection51, including the release of peptides that kill
bacteria (e.g., host defense peptides like Ab)49 50.
Not surprisingly, adding drugs that counteract the
cholesterol to reduce viral entry reduce Ab. The
results of HCQ and anesthetics reducing the
production of Ab provide a molecular rational to
supply exogenous antibiotics in combination with
HCQ so that the overall antibiotics level is
maintained.

Erythromycin, an analog of azithromycin, also
contains a tertiary amine. Other aminoglycosides
(e.g. neomycin) are known to bind tightly to and
scavenge PIP2. Scavenging PIP2 is normally
thought to block ligand binding56 or change a
surface charge. Our data here suggests
hydrophobic charged molecules disrupt PIP2 and
the resulting ACE2 clustering. We previously
assumed the inhibition of PLD2 by tetracaine was
through direct binding of tetracaine to the enzyme,
but here HCQ did not inhibit purified cabbage PLD
(Fig. S2D), suggesting the inhibition could also
occur through disruption of PIP2 and its ability to
bind PLD2.

To date only one large randomized controlled study
has included azithromycin. Overall improvement to
clinical scores was not statistically significant, but
death with both HCQ and azithromycin were
decreased (3 compared to 5 for control)53.
Randomized control trials with HCQ alone have
shown no benefit11. It is not clear at this time why
in vitro and in vivo experiments with HCQ differ.
Anesthetics often require mechanical ventilation,
suggesting studies should focus on death outcome
not mechanical ventilation. None of the studies
considered lung cholesterol. If HCQ acts through
cholesterol, then stratifying patients by lung
cholesterol level may reveal a benefit. Cholesterol
is typically measured in the blood not the tissue.
The blood is primarily a transient transport system
and may not accurately predict years of
accumulation in the lung of obese or chronically
inflamed patients23 51.

A previous mechanism suggested that HCQ could
inhibit SARS-COV-2 viral entry step by changing
the glycosylation of membrane proteins57 58. Our
raft-associated protein activation mechanism is
consistent with changes in glycosylation if the
glycosylated protein is also sensitive to
localization in lipid rafts. Many proteins are

numerous inflammatory proteins.

METHODS

Based on the significant inhibition of SARS2-PV
entry from tetracaine and propofol, a local
anesthetic and a general anesthetic, anestheticlike chemicals are likely helpful to treating
COVID-19. Anesthetic with sugammadex
dramatically decreases post-operative pulmonary
complication59. The similarities between HCQ
and anesthetics in chemical structure, viral entry
inhibition, and raft perturbation tempt us to
hypothesize that both HCQ and anesthetics
share a parallel mechanism of action. Consistent
with this hypothesis CQ has side effects similar to
those reported in anesthetics60.

Chemical and tetracaine was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Purified PLD2 from cabbage was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich respectively. PLD
assay reagent amplex red 10-Acetyl-3,7dihydroxyphenoxazine
and
2-dioctanoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine
(C8-PC)
were
purchased from Cayman Chemical. Horseradish
peroxidase and choline oxidase were purchased
from VWR. Methylbetacyclodextrin (MβCD) was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Reagents

Psuedo-typed SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2-PV) Viral
Entry Assay

The increased viral infection in ACE2 over
expressed cells is likely due to increased number
of total lipid rafts not a shift from ACE2 into GM1
domains. Over expression of ACE2 causes loss of
raft regulation and the enzyme likely distributes into
both raft and no-raft regions23, suggesting over
expression is a completely unphysiological
condition. Hence the reduced efficacy of tetracaine
and HCQ inhibiting viral entry in high cholesterol
(57.7% vs 50.3% and 15.6% vs. 12.8%
respectively, see Fig. 1C) cannot be directly
attributed to a physiologically relevant mechanism.
Nonetheless, in wild type cells ACE2 localization is
still sensitive to cholesterol and the same trend
should hold true. This conclusion is further
supported in Fig. 4d-e where erythromycin was
unable block AB production in high cholesterol.

Cells and virus
HEK293T cell line was cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C with 5% CO2
atmosphere. SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particles
were constructed using plasmid co-transfection,
and the particles were maintained at -80°C. The
constructs were a gift from Dr. Mike Farzan,
Scripps Research, Florida. Evaluation of antiviral
activities HEK293T ACE2 overexpression cells
(0.5 × 105 cells/well), also provided by Dr. Mike
Farzan, were cultured in 96-well cell-culture plates
(CorningTM CoastarTM Cell Culture 96 well plates,
#3585) were incubated with 100 μL pseudotyped
particles of each type, together with 50 μM
hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ, Cayman,
#17911) or 50 μM tetracaine hydrochloride (SigmaAldrich, #T7508) for 1 h. Then, the virus-drug
mixture was removed, and fresh medium was
added. After 24 h, the particles yields were
determined through a luciferase assay. Cells were
washed with PBS and 16 μL Cell Culture Lysis
Reagent (Promega, #E153A) was added into each
well. The plate was incubated for 15 min with
rocking at room temperature. 8 μL of cell lysate
from each well was added into a 384-well plate,
followed by the addition of 16 μL of Luciferase
Assay Substrate (Promega, #E151A). Luciferase
activity measurement was performed on a Spark
20M multimode microplate reader (Tecan). The
luciferase activity as infection yields were plotted in
GraphPad Prism 6 software. All the infection
experiments were performed in a biosafety level-2
(BLS-2) laboratory.

All the imaging was performed with endogenously
expressed proteins to ovoid loss of raft associated
regulation of ACE2. The lipids were labeled after
fixing to reduce movement between domains
during labeling and to limit potential local lipid
clustering by CTxB, especially saturated lipids.
CTxB is pentadentate and in unfixed lipids causes
clustering61 and to some degree CTxB clustering
occurs in fixed cells62. Since we examined
disruption of lipids, the CTxB could have
decreased the amount of disruption we reported for
apparent GM1 raft size (i.e., the amount of
disruption may be under reported). PIP2 is
polyunsaturated and we expect it is much better
fixed in the membrane.

100 nm and consisting of at least 10 localizations.
The apparent raft size was calculated by
measuring the full width half max (FWHM) of the
clusters.

To detect the lipid raft perturbation by
hydroxychloroquine
we
employed
Super
Resolution Microscopy as described previously14.
Briefly, HEK293T cells were grown in 8-well
chamber slides (Nunc Lab-Tek chamber slide
system, Thermo Scientific), washed and treated
with 30-50 μM hydroxychloroquine for 30 min.
The
cells were then fixed with 3%
paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 30-50
μM hydroxychloroquine for 20 min, quenched with
0.1% NaBH4 for 7 min. Cells were then washed
with PBS (three times) and permeabilized with
0.2% Triton-X 100 in PBS for 15 min. The
permeabilized cells were blocked using a standard
blocking buffer containing 10% BSA and 0.05%
Triton in PBS for 90 min. For labelling, cells were
incubated with primary antibody (anti-ACE2
antibody (Abcam, #ab189168), anti-PLD2
antibody, or anti- PIP2 antibody) for 60 min in
antibody buffer (PBS with 5% BSA and 0.05%
TritonX-100) at room temperature followed by 5
washes with wash buffer (PBS with 1% BSA and
0.05% TritonX-100) for 15 min each. Secondary
antibodies (donkey anti-rabbit Cy3B and Alexa
647 conjugated CTxB) were added with antibody
buffer for 30 min at room temperature followed by
5 washes as stated above. Then, cells were
washed with PBS for 5 min and fixed for 10 min
with fixation buffer as above, followed by 5 min
washes with PBS for 3 times and 3 min washes
with deionized distilled water. All steps except for
pre- and post-fixation were performed with
shaking.

Sandwich ELISA assay
HEK293T cells were cultured in 96-well cell-culture
plates. Each well was incubated with and without
100 µL treatments for 1 h, then washed with 100
µL PBS once and incubated with 100 µL PBS for 1
h. Supernatants were collected and analyzed for
Ab40 ELISA.
A 96-well plate was coated with 50 µL capture
antibody (IBL #11088) at 5 µg/ml concentration in
PBS and incubated overnight at 4°C. All of the rest
incubations were performed at room temperature.
The plate was washed with 200 µL PBS for three
times, and 100 µL blocking buffer (PBS with
10%BSA and 0.05% TritonX-100) was added to
each well and incubated for 1 h. Next, the blocking
buffer was removed, and 50 µL of supernatant was
added to each well and incubated for 1 h, followed
by an addition of 50 µL primary antibody
(InvitrogenTM #PA3-16760) at 1:10000 dilution in
PBST buffer (PBS with 0.01% TritonX-100). After
a 3 h incubation, the plate was washed with 200 µL
PBST for 4 times and 100 µL HRP-linked goat antirabbit IgG secondary antibody (InvitrogenTM
#31460) at 0.4 µg/ml concentration in PBST buffer
was added for 1 h incubation in the dark. Then, the
plate was washed with 200 µL PBST for 4 times.
80 µL Chromogen (InvitrogenTM #002023) was
added and incubated in the dark for 30 min. Finally,
80 µL stop solution (InvitrogenTM #SS04) was
applied to terminate the substrate development.
Measurement of absorbance at 450 nm was
performed on a microplate reader (Tecan Infinite
200 PRO) to determine relative Ab40
concentration.

A Zeiss Elyra PS1 microscope was used for super
resolution microscopy with an oil-immersed 63X
objective lens in TIRF mode. Images were
acquired by Andor iXon 897 EMCCD camera and
Zen 10D software with an exposure time of 18 ms
per acquisition. Total 7,000-10,000 frames were
collected. Alexa Fluor 647 and Cy3B were excited
with a 642 nm and 561 nm laser in a photoswitching
buffer
consisting
1%
betamercaptoethanol, 0.4 mg glucose oxidase
and 23.8 µg catalase (oxygen scavengers),
50 mM Tris, 10 mM NaCl, and 10% glucose at pH
8.0. Localization drifts were corrected with n
autocorrelative algorithm63. The drift-corrected
coordinates were converted to be compatible to
Vutara SRX software by an Excel macro. Cluster
analysis and pair correlations were determined
with the default modules in Vutara SRX software.
DBSCAN algorithm was applied to determine the
clusters which are within the search radius (ε) of

Membrane Fluidity Test
Change of membrane fluidity of HEK 293T cells
was measured using the Membrane Fluidity kit
(Abcam) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Briefly, ~10,000 cells were seed in 96 well plates
and incubated with the drugs and the fluorescent
lipid reagent containing pyrenedecanoic acid (2
mM) at the room temperature for 20-30 mins. with.
Pyrenedecanoic acid exists as either a monomer
or an excimer, the latter forms due to the change in
the membrane fluidity. The formation of the
excimers shifts the emission spectrum of the

pyrene probe to the longer wavelength. The
changes in spectrum emission were measured
with a fluorescence microplate reader (Tecan
Infinite 200 Pro). The ratio of monomer (EM 372
nm) to excimer (EM 470 nm) fluorescence was
calculated to obtain a quantitative change of the
membrane fluidity.

samples were normalized to the control activity at
the 120 min time point.
Statistical Analyses
Data calculations and graphs were performed in
Prism 6 (GraphPad software) or Microsoft Excel.
Experiments were done two-three times to
ensure reproducibility. All Experimental samples
were performed in random orders when to avoid
any experimental bias. To ensure the
reproducible effect of the sample sizes, super
resolution imaging was carried out on multiple
cells. Statistical significance was evaluated using
ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett's test, two-tailed ttests, parametric or nonparametric wherever
appropriate. Data are shown as the mean and the
error bars with SD. Significance is indicated by *P
≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, and ****P ≤
0.0001.

In vivo and in vitro PLD Assay
In vivo PLD2 activity was measured in cultured
HEK 293T cells by an enzyme-coupled product
release assay using amplex red reagent as
described previously14. Cells were seeded into 96well plates (~5×104 cells per well) and incubated at
37 °C overnight to reach confluency. The cells
were starved with serum-free DMEM for a day and
washed once with PBS (phosphate-buffered
saline). The PLD reaction was initiated by adding
100 μL of reaction buffer (100 μM amplex red, 2
U/ml horseradish peroxidase (HRP), 0.2 U/ml
choline oxidase, and 60 μM C8-PC, 50 mM
HEPES, and 5 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0). The assay
reaction was performed for 2-4 hour at 37 °C and
the activity was kinetically measured with a
fluorescence microplate reader (Tecan Infinite 200
Pro) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 530
nm and 585 nm, respectively. For in vitro assay,
cabbage PLD was used instead of the live cells and
the PLD reaction was initiated as described for the
in vivo assay. The PLD2 activity was calculated by
subtracting the background activity (reaction buffer
with the drugs, but no cells). For the bar graphs,

Supplemental Figures

Fig. S1. Membrane heterogeneity. (A) GM1 rafts are clusters of saturated known as liquid ordered (Lo) and commonly
reside separate from liquid disordered (Ld) phases62. The ordered phase (Lo) is generally enriched in sphingomyelin
and cholesterol whereas the disordered (Ld) phase consists of unsaturated lipids and includes polyunsaturated lipids like
PA and PIP264. (B) Cartoon diagram showing the experimental setup for loading cultured cells with cholesterol. i.,
Cholesterol (yellow shading) loaded into lipoprotein (e.g., low- and high-density lipoprotein (LDL and HDL
respectively)) from blood serum. ii., Cholesterol free human apolipoprotein E (apoE, brown shading), a cholesterol
transport protein, is exposed to cholesterol from blood serum and iii, ApoE transports cholesterol into of cells (grey
shading). (C) SARS2-PV entry in ACE2 overexpressing HEK293T cells without and with cholesterol loading indicated
by raw luciferase activity readout. Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m., unpaired t-test, n=4. (D) Model of HCQ and
anesthetics translocating APP from GM1 rafts to disordered regions through raft perturbation to reduce the synthesis of
Ab.
