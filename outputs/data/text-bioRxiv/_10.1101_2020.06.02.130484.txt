Abstract

11

The recent outbreak of a new coronavirus that causes a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in humans

12

(SARS-CoV-2) has developed into a global pandemic with over 6 million reported cases and more than

13

375,000 deaths worldwide. Many countries have faced a shortage of diagnostic kits as well as a lack

14

of infrastructure to perform necessary testing. Due to these limiting factors, only patients showing

15

symptoms indicating infection were subjected to testing, whilst asymptomatic individuals, who are

16

widely believed to be responsible for the fast dispersion of the virus, were largely omitted from the

17

testing regimes. The inability to implement high throughput diagnostic and contact tracing strategies

18

has forced many countries to institute lockdowns with severe economic and social consequences. The

19

World Health Organization (WHO) has encouraged affected countries to increase testing capabilities

20

to identify new cases, allow for a well-controlled lifting of lockdown measures, and prepare for future

21

outbreaks. Here, we propose HiDRA-seq, a rapidly implementable, high throughput, and scalable

22

solution that uses NGS lab infrastructure and reagents for population-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing. This

23

method is based on the use of indexed oligo-dT primers to generate barcoded cDNA from a large

24

number of patient samples. From this, highly multiplexed NGS libraries are prepared targeting SARS-

25

CoV-2 specific regions and sequenced. The low amount of sequencing data required for diagnosis

26

allows the combination of thousands of samples in a sequencing run, while reducing the cost to

27

approximately 2 CHF/EUR/USD per RNA sample. Here, we describe in detail the first version of the

28

protocol, which can be further improved in the future to increase its sensitivity and to identify other

29

respiratory viruses or analyze individual genetic features associated with disease progression.

Introduction

35

Over 350,000 deaths worldwide have resulted from complications resulting from Severe Acute

36

Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with another 6 million reported infected

37

by this virus, causing a major pandemic. The overall public health and economic burden of this

38

pandemic has yet to be realized and will only become apparent in the coming years. Switzerland alone

39

has recorded one of the highest numbers of COVID-19 (the disease caused by caused by SARS-CoV-2)

40

cases per capita in the world1. Thus, efficient and sensitive detection assays of SARS-CoV-2 are

41

essential in managing this pandemic, as evidence suggests that the virus is most contagious on or

42

before symptom onset. Furthermore, asymptomatic cases and the so-called “super spreaders” have

43

broadly contributed to the dissemination of the virus, as reports from South Korea suggest2.

44

Comprehensive contact tracing, tracking the spread of viral transmission, clearly requires an increase

45

of mass testing to a population scale.

46

The vast majority of the currently available SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays are based on the

47

amplification of specific loci in the viral genome through Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain

48

Reaction (RT-qPCR). RT-qPCR assays have been the gold standard in clinical diagnostics due to their

49

high sensitivity. However, this outbreak has demonstrated that there exists a general lack of

50

infrastructure for such population-scale testing, in addition to a limited supply of reagents for RT-qPCR

51

tests. Furthermore, the outcome of RT-qPCR is a binary result (positive or negative) for the loci

52

interrogated. The main drawback being the lack of genotypic information in RT-qPCR assays, which

53

could enable the mapping of the spread and transmission, as well as the monitoring of the evolution

54

of the etiological agent, which is crucial for vaccine development.

55

NGS has revolutionized biomedical research in the last 15 years and is increasingly impacting clinical

56

diagnostics and the practice of medicine. Our aim was to develop a diagnostic assay that could profit

57

from the power and sensitivity of these technologies, not only for viral detection but also for viral

58

classification. In this study, we present HiDRA-seq, a low-cost, high-throughput targeted approach for

59

SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis and for potentially tracing outbreak origin and tracking transmission.

60

In recent months, several protocols have been developed for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using NGS.

61

However, most of the proposed methods are based on the amplification of the entire viral genome,

62

which is time consuming, rather expensive, and require specific kits for enrichment (amplicon or

63

hybridization based) as well as a comprehensive de novo pipeline to analyze the data and advanced

64

bioinformatic pipelines3. We propose a midway and rapidly implementable option that uses genomics

65

lab infrastructure and reagents available in large NGS facilities, bypassing the need for commercially

66

available kits and the limitations in the global chain of production. HiDRA-seq combines reverse

67

transcription using barcoded oligo-dT primers, adapted from mcSCRB-seq4, with the addition of virus2

68

specific amplicon generation and sequencing. The protocol targets a region of the putative ORF10,

69

which is highly conserved in the different SARS-CoV-2 isolates sequenced to date. The targeted region

70

is located near the 3’-end of the genome5,6, so HiDRA-seq can capture both the viral genomic RNA

71

(gRNA) as well as all subgenomic RNA transcripts (sgRNA) generated in infected cells.

72

We would like to emphasize that our approach consists of a viral enrichment, followed by the

73

generation of a small amount of short read sequencing data and the use of a basic bioinformatics

74

pipeline for downstream mapping and diagnosis. The small amount of short read sequencing data

75

required to correctly diagnose an individual allows the multiplexing of hundreds to thousands of

76

patients in one sequencing run and is an affordable reality at a price of approximately 2 CHF/EUR/USD

77

per sample (from extracted RNA to diagnosis). Furthermore, HiDRA-seq can be adapted by a wide

78

variety of short read sequencers with diverse outputs across the clinics. The nature of the enrichment

79

step in this protocol offers an enormous versatility, as it can be tailored to any other respiratory virus

80

or organism of interest that produces poly-adenylated transcripts. The implementation of a rapid and

81

versatile approach such as HiDRA-seq would definitely enable a more efficient outbreak

82

management.

Protocol description

86

Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, various research groups have been working on the

87

development of alternative testing protocols to bypass the shortage of standard diagnostic kits and

88

enable population scale testing. With this idea, we have developed HiDRA-seq, a high throughput,

89

rapidly implementable solution that uses standard lab infrastructure and reagents in medium sized

90

NGS facilities (Figure 1A). The reverse transcription and cDNA pooling strategies are adapted from the

91

mcSCBR-seq protocol4. Using a low volume liquid handling robot, the patients’ RNA (previously

92

extracted from swab samples) is distributed in 384-well plates containing indexed oligo-dT primers. A

93

short reverse transcription is performed to generate barcoded cDNA and the contents of each well

94

are pooled into a single tube. Following bead purification and exonuclease treatment to digest the

95

excess of unbound primers, the pooled cDNA is used as template in a PCR reaction with a forward

96

primer specific to SARS-CoV-2 and a reverse primer binding to a sequence incorporated with the oligo-

97

dT in the reverse transcription. Both primers contain the sequences required to generate an Illumina

98

sequencer compatible library in a final PCR reaction, in which the amplicon pool can be barcoded,

99

which allows the multiplexing of multiple 384-well plates in a single sequencing run. After sequencing,

100

the reads are de-multiplexed based on both the plate and the sample barcodes and used in an

automated analysis pipeline to distinguish samples containing SARS-CoV-2-derived reads, which are

102

diagnosed as positive.

103
104

SARS-CoV-2-specific amplicon design

105

We designed three different partially over-lapping amplicons in order to compare their performance

106

and, simultaneously, simulate the combination of three different patient plates that need to be de-

107

multiplexed upon sequencing. For the amplicon design, highly conserved regions between SARS-CoV-

108

2 isolates were identified by creating a whole genome alignment of the European SARS-CoV-2

109

sequences (n = 1435, sequence identity = 98.96%). The identified sequences are not conserved in

110

other human coronavirus. As cDNA is barcoded using indexed oligo-dT, the forward primers must be

111

located close to the poly-A sequence in the viral genome to obtain amplicons of a reasonable size.

112

Moreover, primers binding to the 3’ of the genome can efficiently capture both the viral genomic RNA

113

(gRNA) as well as all subgenomic RNA transcripts (sgRNAs) generated in infected cells, which may

114

increase the sensitivity of the method. With these premises, we identified a 100% conserved region

115

in the putative ORF10 of SARS-CoV-2. The GC content in this region is highly variable, so primers were

116

designed to target sequences of lower GC contents (<50%). We designed three forward primers

117

targeting this region that are used to generate three SARS-CoV-2 specific amplicons (Figure 1B). The

118

three amplicons were tested separately in order to compare their performance. For the human

119

internal control, we followed a similar strategy and designed a forward primer located in close

120

proximity to the poly-A sequence of human GAPDH (Figure 1B). This ensures that a fragment that can

121

be sequenced is always generated even in SARS-CoV-2 negative samples. The reverse primer is

122

common to all amplicons and it anneals to the 3’-end of the barcoded oligo-dT used to generate the

123

cDNA in the reverse transcription.

124
125

Initial data quality control

126

For the implementation of the protocol, 91 anonymized clinical samples containing RNA extracted

127

from patients’ swaps were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Huber and Dr. Jürg Böni (Institute of Medical

128

Virology, UZH, Switzerland). These clinical samples were transferred to four identical quadrants in a

129

384-well plate, such that each sample would be processed in quadruplicate for each of the three SARS-

130

CoV-2 amplicons designed and tested for the study. The samples were processed using a Mosquito HV

131

liquid pipetting robot (SPT Labtech), as indicated in materials and methods, and sequenced in both an

132

Illumina MiniSeq (R1=16 bp, i7=8 bp, R2=50 bp) and NovaSeq6000 sequencers (data not shown, R1=16

133

bp, i7=8 bp, R2=150 bp). The 8 bases barcode was used, in this case, to discriminate the different

134

amplicons but it could alternatively be used to de-multiplex several patient plates. The first 6 bases in

135

read one were used to demultiplex the reads generated from the different patient samples. UMI

136

correction was not applied in this version of the protocol. The 50 bases in read 2 were used to

137

distinguish between positive and negative patients by mapping reads against the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

138

After demultiplexing and prior to mapping, the dataset was subjected to standard quality control

139

checks and data filtering. As the input for the protocols was not normalized, a wide distribution in the

140

number of reads per sample was observed (Figure 2A). Reads were filtered by abundance per

141

sample/amplicon combination (n < 250 for one sample/amplicon combination). 250 reads per

142

sample/amplicon combination (750 reads per sample) was sufficient to minimize the minor effects of

143

index hopping on the SARS-CoV-2 alignment rate for a given sample, and accurately represent the

144

abundance of SARS-CoV-2-mapping reads in a given samples’ data. Based on the RT-qPCR diagnostics

145

results, samples for which GAPDH was undetectable after 40 cycles of RT-qPCR were removed, and

146

finally 83 patient samples in technical quadruplicates remained.

147

The alignment of reads to SARS-CoV-2 and GAPDH was performed using Bowtie2 using end-to-end

148

mode. More than 99.9% of mapped reads mapped uniquely to the targeted locus, indicating successful

149

primer design (Figure 2B). The global alignment rate of the reads was of 26.96%, 43.47% and 36.69%

150

for amplicons 29652, 29691, and 29709, respectively.

151
152

Diagnostic capability of the assay

153

Ct values for sets of RT-qPCR technical replicates were normalized and correlated to the alignment

154

rate using the Wilcoxon-Signed-Rank test for matched pairs (p<0.001 for each amplicon; see Figure

155

3A). The per sample alignment rate is shown to be highly correlated with RT-qPCR Ct value (see Figure

156

3B). Samples which returned a Ct value > 25 for SARS-CoV-2 in the diagnostic test, had their alignment

157

rates fall, typically within one standard deviation of the mean alignment rate, for the set of samples

158

diagnosed “negative” with RT-qPCR. This demonstrates that HiDRA-seq is thus far, incapable of

159

identifying with certainty positive samples with a RT-qPCR Ct value > 25. However, there were two

160

exceptions in which the HiDRA-seq system was able to successfully diagnose samples with Ct values >

161

37. Amplicon 29691 generated the results most consistent with the RT-qPCR diagnosis for Ct values

162

within the range 29 – 40 (see Figure 3C).

163

We generated potential diagnostic thresholds, based upon the alignment rate (AR) of a sample’s reads

164

to the SARS-CoV-2 genome, by iterating through values on [0,1] in increments of 0.01. We counted for

165

each value, the number of positively diagnosed samples (via RT-qPCR) that had ARs below this value,

166

and the number of negatively diagnosed samples (via RT-qPCR) that had ARs above this value. We

167

then selected intervals for which the number of false diagnoses were minimized as a basis for a

168

theoretical diagnostic threshold. Potential diagnostic thresholds were set individually for each

amplicon as follows (see Figure 4): Amplicon 29652: AR ε [0.02 , 0.11]; Amplicon 29691: AR ε [0.05 ,

170

0.24]; Amplicon 29709: AR ε [0.04 , 0.18]. On the intervals of AR values for which the number of false

171

diagnoses was minimized, amplicons 29652 and 29709 mis-diagnosed 8 patients and Amplicon 29692

172

mis-diagnosed 7 patients. Furthermore, amplicons 29652, 29709 and 29692 had a successful

173

diagnostic rate with respect to RT-qPCR diagnosis of 90.4%, 90.4% and 91.6%, respectively.

174
175

Discussion

176

The surge in cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections around the world has created an urgent need for accurate

177

and fast diagnostic testing solutions. Despite the recent increase in available SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic

178

testing kits in the past few months, the majority of tests still rely on real-time quantitative PCR (RT-

179

qPCR). Whilst RT-qPCR reactions are generally very sensitive (i.e. able to detect true positive cases)

180

and specific, the technology has inherent limitations with regard to large scale population screening,

181

which has become increasingly important during this pandemic. Additionally, RT-qPCR does not

182

provide any genotypic information regarding a patient’s infection beyond the causal organism.

183

Another advantage of NGS over RT-qPCR is that NGS provides a direct and functional measurement

184

SARS-CoV-2. RT-qPCR generates florescent measurements for individual plate wells, indirectly

185

quantifying the presence of genetic material in relative concentrations. Alternatively, NGS generates

186

thousands of reads, directly measuring the specific sequences present in a sample. The sequence

187

information generated could provide insight into the specific infecting isolate and aid in tracing

188

transmission within communities.

189

HiDRA-seq, built on Next Generation Sequencing technology, has the ability to multiplex thousands of

190

barcoded patient samples, significantly increasing current testing capacity. Our method is designed to

191

be partially performed on a small automated liquid handling machine, so that a single person is able

192

process more than 2,000 RNA samples per day with ease. This results in an overall shorter diagnostic

193

turnaround time, with library preparation and sequencing data obtained in as little as 1.5 days. Our

194

system does not match the speed of RT-qPCR for individual samples. However, it outperforms

195

standard diagnostics methods in scale, allowing one to process hundreds of thousands of samples per

196

week if extended and automated at scale. The faster a test can be administered, the sooner the results

197

can be received, and the quicker measures can be put in place to mitigate further spread or to evaluate

198

the impact of loosened containment measures. This system also minimizes the errors in sample

199

handling by fast-tracking sample preparation, an integral part of the workflow. The achievement of

200

consistent data across samples verifies the reproducibility and reliability of our system. Additionally,

201

the miniaturization of our reactions results in a much more affordable solution compared to other

6

202

methodologies available in the market. Our estimated price for sample screening from extracted RNA

203

to diagnostic result with our approach is 2 CHF/EUR/USD.

204

By comparing our results to the RT-qPCR-based clinical diagnostic test, we show that the mapping rate

205

is a strong predictor of Ct values (p<0.001). Our method is sensitive, as we have been able to correctly

206

recall positive samples in >90% of the cases, which is comparable to other NGS-based methods use

207

for virus detection in clinical samples7. The samples that escaped detection are characterized by

208

having high Ct values from the diagnostic RT-qPCR (Ct>25). In parallel to HiDRA-seq, we prepared

209

libraries using the highly sensitive Smart-seq2 protocol8, which captures all poly-adenylated RNA in

210

the sample, and we were similarly unable to detect a significant number of virus-derived reads. The

211

sensitivity of HiDRA-seq could be improved by slightly increasing the number of PCR cycles used in the

212

amplicon generation and using UMI correction for detection of PCR duplicates to increase the

213

quantitative accuracy of the method. Although we were able to successfully diagnose the majority of

214

samples using 50 bp reads, the designed primers allowed us to access 71 bp of a highly variable region

215

(following Amplicon 29709) by generating reads of 150 bp, raising the possibility of using this method

216

for basic phylogenetic and epidemiological studies of isolates differing at this genomic position.

217

HiDRA-seq will be optimized to enable direct lysis from saliva collected by gargling. Given that the

218

mcSCRB-seq4 method, from which this protocol derives, is designed to work with direct lysis from

219

single cells, this approach will be adapted for HiDRA-seq, since RNA extraction is one of the biggest

220

bottle-necks for large scale testing. The current sensitivity of our method makes it compatible with

221

direct testing from saliva, as suggested in a recent publication9.

222

Our method uses barcoded oligo-dT primers to generate cDNA in the reverse transcription and this

223

feature leaves the door open to expanding the amplicon panel. To achieve this, additional PCR primers

224

could be added to generate amplicons that are specific for other human coronaviruses (hCoVs) or

225

other respiratory virus that produce polyadenylated transcripts. Such viruses include influenza viruses

226

(IAVs), respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) or human metapneumoviruses

227

(MPVs), which would create a multi-viral identification test at almost no extra cost. Potentially, this

228

approach could also be implemented to specifically detect the expression of virtually any human

229

mRNA identified as a biomarker for estimating disease susceptibility and progression, or for designing

230

host group-specific COVID-19 treatment regimens. This is especially relevant in a clinical research

231

setup, in which the importance of a test that could both identify an infection and give information on

232

how to best treat that infection cannot be overstated.

233

This method has been designed with the practical necessities of large scale, affordable, adaptable and

234

rapid testing in mind. To these ends, we have developed a first version of a method that reuses

235

relatively common sets of barcoding primers available in NGS facilities, can scale effectively, does not

Reverse transcription with barcoded oligo-dT

243

This part of the protocol is based on the reverse transcription strategy used in mcSCRB-seq (Bagnoli

244

et al., 2018). A 384-well barcoding plate was prepared using a Mosquito HV liquid handling robot (SPT

245

Labtech), each of the wells containing 0.5 µl of lysis solution (0.2% Triton X-100 [Roche], 0.8 units of

246

RNasin Plus [Promega], 4 mM dNTPs [Promega] and 1 µM of barcoded oligo-dT primers [E3V6NEXT,

247

IDT]). The plate was divided into four quadrants (91 samples each) with four identical copies of a 96-

248

well plate containing RNA extracted from anonymous patients’ swaps (kindly provided by Dr. Michael

249

Huber and Dr. Jürg Böni, Institute of Medical Virology, UZH, Switzerland) by transferring 0.5 µl of RNA

250

to the corresponding well positions. The plate was heated at 65° C for 5 minutes and transferred to

251

ice prior to the addition of 1 ul of 2X Reverse transcription mix (15% PEG 8000 [Sigma Aldrich], 2X

252

Maxima RT buffer [Thermo Fischer] and 4 units of Maxima H Minus RT [Thermo Fisher]). cDNA

253

synthesis was performed for 15 min at 50°C followed by 5 min at 85° C for inactivation. The Mosquito

254

HV liquid handling robot (SPT Labtech) was used to pool the whole 384-well plate containing the

255

barcoded cDNA into a single 2 ml DNA LoBind tubes (Eppendorf) and cleaned up using Sera-Mag Select

256

beads (GE Healthcare) with a ratio 1:0.8 (pooled cDNA:beads). Purified cDNA was eluted in 17 µl and

257

residual primers digested with Exonuclease I (Thermo Fisher) for 20 min at 37 °C.

SARS-CoV-2-specific amplicon generation

259

Three different SARS-CoV-2-specific primers (SCoV2_29691, SCoV2_29709, SCoV2_29652) were used

260

in individual PCR reactions, in combination with a human GAPDH-specific primer (GAPDH_1127) and

261

a PCR primer binding to the barcoding sequence, to generate three virus specific amplicons. These

262

primers also contain the adaptor sequences needed to incorporate the Illumina compatible flow cell

263

binding sequences in a subsequent PCR reaction. Briefly, each PCR reaction was assembled by

264

combining 5 ul of the pooled barcoded cDNA with 20 µl of PCR master mix (1.25X KAPA HiFi HotStart

265

ReadyMix [Roche], 0.375 uM of SARS-CoV-2- and GAPDH-specific primers [Microsynth AG] and 0.375

266

uM of the PCR primer [Microsynth AG]). PCR was performed using the following program: 3 min at

267

98 °C for initial denaturation followed by 25 cycles of 20 sec at 98 °C, 15 sec at 60 °C, 15 sec at 72 °C.

268

Final elongation was performed for 5 min at 72 °C. Once the PCR was concluded, the amplicons were

269

cleaned up using Sera-Mag Select beads (GE Healthcare) with a ratio 1:0.8 (DNA:beads). The size and

270

concentration of the amplicons was analyzed in a 4200 TapeStation System (Agilent) using a D1000

271

ScreenTape.

272
273

Library generation and plate barcoding incorporation

274

A final PCR was performed from the amplicon to generate libraries compatible with Illumina

275

sequencer. In parallel, three different barcodes were assigned for the aforementioned amplicons in

276

order to combine them in a single sequencing run. This strategy can be used to combine different

277

plates with patient samples, allowing one to easily increase the throughput of the protocol. Each PCR

278

reaction was assembled by combining, in individual tubes, 5 ul of the three amplicons with 20 µl of

279

PCR master mix containing 1.25X KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Roche), 0.375 uM of the i5 primer

280

(Microsynth AG) and 0.375 uM of the barcoded i7 primer (Illumina). PCR was performed using the

281

following program: 3 min at 98 °C for initial denaturation followed by 5 cycles of 20 sec at 98 °C, 15 sec

282

at 55 °C, 15 sec at 72 °C. A final elongation was performed for 5 min at 72 °C. Once the PCR was

283

completed, the libraries were cleaned up using Sera-Mag Select beads (GE Healthcare) with a ratio

284

1:0.8 (DNA:beads). The size and concentration of the libraries were analyzed in a 4200 TapeStation

285

System (Agilent) using a D1000 ScreenTape.

286
287

Sequencing

288

The three libraries generated from three different viral amplicons, all in combination with a GAPDH-

289

derived library, were paired-end sequenced together in both an Illumina MiniSeq (R1=16 bp, i7=8 bp,

290

R2=50 bp) and NovaSeq6000 sequencers (data not shown, R1=16 bp, i7=8 bp, R2=150 bp). PhiX was

291

added to account for 25% of the total library, to increase library diversity and subsequently,

292

sequencing performance. The 6 first bases in read one were used to demultiplex the reads generated

293

from the different patient. The 8 bases in the barcode allowed, in this case, to discriminate the

294

different amplicons but it could alternatively be used to multiplex several patient plates for

295

sequencing. The 50/150 bases in read 2 were used to distinguish between positive and negative

296

patients by mapping reads against the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

297
298

Bioinformatic analysis

299

Reads were segregated by patient, amplicon and plate. The demultiplexed reads were then processed

300

using the standard tools displayed below. A consensus sequence for SARS-CoV-2 genome was

301

generated from the set of published genomes on NCBI using the Bio.Align Python 3 package (data not

302

shown). Bowtie210, samtools11,12 and pysam were used to generate pileup columns and calculate

303

alignment rates for a subset of our samples, on all loci in the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome to verify the

304

locus-specificity of our primers. After verifying the quality of our reads, Bowtie2 was used to map all

305

of our samples against the SARS-CoV-2 genomic region of interest (from 29600 bp to 29900 bp,

306

inclusive), and GAPDH. Alignment rates were calculated as a ratio of total reads for a given sample, to

307

the number of reads aligning to our region of interest on the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

308
309

Samples for which the initial diagnostic PCR failed (i.e. GAPDH was undetectable after 40 cycles of

310

PCR) were filtered from the dataset. Additionally, samples for which we recovered less than 250

311

sequencing reads per amplicon were filtered out of the dataset. After filtering had been applied, our

312

dataset contained 83 sets of patient quadruplicates. Undetected Ct values of SARS-CoV-2 were

313

imputed and values were then normalized to GAPDH using the Livak and Schmittgen method13. The

314

Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test was applied to the set of patient replicates, comparing the SARS-CoV-2

315

alignment rate and the normalized Ct value recovered from RT-qPCR (p < 0.0001 for each amplicon).

Figure 1. (A) Schematic representation of the protocol. Using a low volume liquid handling robot, the

363

patients’ RNA is distributed in 384-well plates containing indexed oligo-dT primers. Barcoded cDNA is

364

generated by reverse transcription and pooled into a single tube. Libraries are produced from SARS-

365

CoV-2-specific amplicons and sequenced. Reads are de-multiplexed based on both a plate and a

366

sample barcode and used for downstream diagnostic analysis. (B) Amplicon primer design. The table

367

contains the sequences of the forward primers used to generate the different amplicons. The reverse

368

primer is common to all amplicons and it anneals to the 3’-end of the barcoded oligo-dT primers used

369

to generate cDNA in the reverse transcription. The primer labels contain the position of the first

370

sequenced base. Insert length was calculated using the start of the poly-A sequence. SARS-CoV-2

371

NC_045512_2 sequence and GAPDH NM_002046.4 sequence were used as reference. For the

372

theoretical size of the amplicon after PCR 1 the Nextera Tag (34bp), the length of the barcoded Oligo-

373

dT-primer (80bp) and the primer sequence was added.

Figure 2. (A) Read distribution in the different wells of the plate. The histogram shows the read

385

numbers obtained in the different wells of the plate for the different amplicons. As the input for the

386

protocols was not normalized, a wide distribution in the number of reads is observed. Wells with <250

387

reads were discarded for further analysis. (B) Read alignment to SARS-CoV-2 genome. The number of

388

reads aligning to the 3’-end of viral genome is shown for the different amplicons. More than 99.9% of

389

reads aligning to SARS-CoV-2 mapped to the locus targeted in the amplicon design.

Figure 3. (A) Matched pairs of normalized Ct values and alignment rate. Ct values (y-axis-left) for sets

414

of RT-qPCR technical replicates were normalized (N(Ct) = 2-𝚫𝚫Ct) and correlated to the alignment rate

415

(y-axis-right) for the different amplicons using the Wilcoxon-Signed-Rank test for matched pairs (p <

416

0.001). (B) Correlation of normalized Ct values and alignment rate. One point is shown for each

417

sample and amplicon combination, coloured by amplicon type. The normalised Ct value on the x-axis,

418

mapped against its corresponding alignment rate on the y-axis. (C) Alignment rate vs. raw Ct values

419

for samples diagnosed positive via RT-qPCR. This figure shows one point for each sample and

420

amplicon combination, and displays only those samples that were diagnosed positive via RT-qPCR. The

421

x-axis shows the Ct value associated with these positive samples, with their corresponding alignment

422

rate shown on the y-axis. This demonstrates a sensitivity threshold for HiDRA-seq in terms of RT-qPCR

423

Ct values (Ct ≈ 25).

Figure 4. (A) Histogram of false diagnoses for potential diagnostic thresholds: For each amplicon

427

used, the number of potential mischaracterized diagnoses (false-positives in blue or false-negatives in

428

red), in numbers of patients (y-axis), are shown for a given alignment rate threshold (x-axis). Original

429

diagnoses are given via RT-qPCR. Amplicon 29691 is shown to have the fewest number of mis-

430

characterized diagnoses (7) when said diagnoses are minimized, and Amplicon 29652 is shown to have

431

the shortest span of intersection between both distributions (0.9). (B) Distributions of alignment rates

432

for positive and negative patient quadruplicates, by amplicon: For each amplicon, the mean

433

percentage (across four replicates) of reads that aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 genome (y-axis) is shown

434

as a point, with patients diagnosed positive via RT-qPCR shown in purple and patients diagnosed

435

negative via RT-qPCR shown in green. The distribution of alignment rates for patients diagnosed

436

positive with RT-qPCR is shown to be much wider (spanning roughly 87 percentiles on average) than

437

those diagnosed negative (spanning roughly 14 percentiles on average).
