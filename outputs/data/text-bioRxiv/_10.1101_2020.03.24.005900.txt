Abstract
Based on genome-scale loss-of-function screens we discovered that Topoisomerase III-ß
(TOP3B), a human topoisomerase that acts on DNA and RNA, is required for yellow fever virus
and dengue virus-2 replication. Remarkably, we found that TOP3B is required for efficient
replication of all positive-sense-single stranded RNA viruses tested, including SARS-CoV-2.
While there are no drugs that specifically inhibit this topoisomerase, we posit that TOP3B is an
attractive anti-viral target.

Acute viral infections, particularly those caused by RNA viruses, are dangerous threats to public
health. This has been made evident by the ongoing pandemic of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), officially named COVID-19, caused by the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
When confronted with emerging viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 we are left with few
countermeasures that can be deployed to specifically prevent or treat the diseases they cause. We
and others have argued that deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms required for viral
replication can reveal potential vulnerabilities for related viruses. These vulnerabilities could be
based on unique viral targets, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, or on dependency
on host encoded pro-viral activities. To identify such host pro-viral factors we embarked on
genome-scale screens for diverse families of viruses and identified scores of required host factors
1-4

. Some of these host factors are attractive drug targets.
A meta-analysis of RNAi-based loss-of-function screens for YFV and DENV-2 host factors

revealed 274 common candidates 1. TDRD3, a Tudor domain containing protein that interacts
with methylated arginine motifs 5, was identified as a candidate host factor required for both
DENV2/YFV. In the two YFV screens TDRD3 ranked 66th of over 21,500 gene products in terms
of how well its knockdown decreased YFV (adjusted p value = 0.0006). CRISPR-Cas9 mediated
knockout of TDRD3 in HuH-7 cells confirmed that this protein was required for efficient DENV2 replication (Fig 1A & B).
A well-known function of TDRD3 is to bind and stabilize Topoisomerase III-ß (TOP3B) 6-8,
a type IA topoisomerase and the only human topoisomerase known to act on both DNA and RNA
6,9

. Knockout of TDRD3 in HuH-7 cells led to levels of TOP3B that were almost as low as those

obtained with knockout of TOP3B itself (Fig 1C). Knockout of TOP3B, which does not alter
TDRD3 levels, resulted in the same dramatic decrease in DENV-2, YFV and Zika virus (ZIKV)
replication as knockout of TDRD3 (Fig 1D & E), which suggested that the only role of TDRD3

in viral replication was to stabilize TOP3B. Indeed, TOP3B overexpression rescued DENV-2
infection in TDRD3 KO cells (Fig 1F). The reverse was not true, TDRD3 overexpression was
incapable of rescuing virus replication in a TOP3B KO cells. Therefore, we conclude that TOP3B
is a proviral host factor for several flaviviruses.
The genetic approaches we utilized above do not distinguish between direct and indirect
modes of action. To address whether or not TOP3B directly interacted with DENV-2 genomes we
used UV crosslinking followed by RNA immunoprecipitation (CLIP). We carried out CLIP
assays using a HEK-293T cell line that expressed a FLAG-tagged TOP3B upon doxycycline
treatment and anti-FLAG antibodies to carry out the immunoprecipitation. FLAG-TOP3B
preferentially crosslinked to CELSR2 RNA, which was previously known to bind this
topoisomerase 6, relative to EEF1A1 RNA, which we use as a negative control (Fig 1H).
Importantly, TOP3B crosslinked DENV-2 RNA (Fig 1H), strongly suggesting that TOP3B acts
directly on the viral genome.
Since TOP3B was required for DENV-2, YFV and ZIKV replication, we asked whether or
not this topoisomerase was required for replication of other viruses. Influenza A virus, which has
a negative-sense segmented RNA genome and belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae,
replicated significantly better in TOP3B KO cells than in the parental HuH-7 cells (Fig 2A, left
panel), suggesting that TOP3B plays an anti-viral role for influenza A virus. We also tested Ebola
virus, a member of the family Filoviridae, which has a negative sense RNA genome and again
noted that Ebola virus replicated slightly better in TOP3B KO cells than in the parental HuH-7
cells (Fig 2A, right panel). We thus suggest that TOP3B may be an anti-viral factor for negative
sense RNA viruses, and clearly is not required for the replication of influenza A virus or Ebola
virus.

We tested a series of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses ((+) ss RNA viruses). A
recombinant chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus of the Togaviridae family was sensitive
to TDRD3 knockout (Fig 2B, left panel), and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), an enterovirus of the
family Picornaviridae, was dependent on TOP3B for efficient replication (Fig 2B, right panel).
Most important in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, four betacoronaviruses, of the
Coronaviridae family, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SCH1014-CoV, a bat
coronavirus, were significantly crippled by TOP3B KO (Fig 2C). These results indicated that
TOP3B is a host factor essential for efficient replication of a diverse group of (+) ss RNA viruses.
Among host factors required for diverse groups of RNA viruses are components of the
translation machinery and the proteasome, in addition to factors that mediate membrane
transactions required for entry and exit of viruses. The understanding of the broad requirement for
TOP3B among (+) ss RNA viruses will likely provide important insights into heretofore
understudied steps in their lifecycles. While a requirement for human topoisomerase TOP1 in
exacerbated inflammation induced by RNA virus infection has been previously documented 10,
the direct action of an RNA topoisomerase in viral replication is unprecedented, and has
important biological implications. A requirement for a RNA topoisomerase as a critical cofactor
for (+) ss RNA viruses is reasonable since viral genomes, because of their complex structures and
size, especially the large coronaviruses, may lend themselves to topological problems (knots and
catenanes) 11,12. In parallel work focused on exploring these implications we have shown that
TOP3B is required for a late step in DENV-2 replication, likely during the assembly of the
genome into virions (Prasanth et al., manuscript in preparation). Furthermore, this action requires
the topoisomerase activity of TOP3B since it is abrogated by a tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation
(Y336F) in the active site of the enzyme (Ibid).

Here we emphasize the potential for TOP3B as a drug target. It must be clear that we make
this suggestion responsibly with full understanding that our work is an early step in what must be
a rigorous process to identify effective antivirals. Nonetheless, several facts support this
consideration. TOP3B-/- mice are viable 13 and humans with a homozygous 240-kb deletion of
chromosome 22q11.22 spanning TOP3B gene are also viable7. Although both homozygous null
mice and humans have abnormal phenotypes, the enzyme is not essential. Topoisomerase
inhibitors are well known drugs used to treat cancer (e.g. doxorubicin)14 and bacterial infections
(e.g., ciproflaxin) 15. Unfortunately, we are not aware of any approved TOP3B drugs and prior to
this report there was no evidence that inhibiting TOP3B could be a useful in treating acute viral
infections. In fact other than the ACE-2 receptor, and perhaps furin, required for SARS-CoV-2
attachment and entry 16, TOP3B is the only other known required host factor. We hope this brief
communication will spur interactions between individuals studying TOP3B and developing
inhibitors of TOP3B, and those working on SARS-CoV-2.

Plasmid construction. To construct CRISPR editing plasmids targeting TDRD3 (pX330-TDRD
gRNA1, pX330-TDRD gRNA1) or TOP3B gene (px330-TOP3B gRNA1, pX330-TDRD
gRNA2), oligo sequences provided upon request, were purchased from IDT and were sub-cloned
into pX330 as described previously 20. To generate pFLAG-TOP3B, human Full-length Top3B
with FLAG-Tag sequence was amplified using the following set of primers: forward (5′CCCAAGCTTATGGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGAAGACTGTGCTCATGGTTGCT
GAA-3′) and reverse (5′- CGCGGATCCTCATACAAAGTAGGCGGCCAGGGCTGACAT -3′).
And the amplicon sequence was sub-cloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO plasmid (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Plasmids GFP-tagged full length TDRD3 (pGFP-TDRD3), TOP3B (pGFP-TOP3B)
and were described previously (Yang et al., 2010).
Generation of TDRD3 and TOP3B knockout cells by the CRISPR/Cas9 system. To generate
TDRD3 KO cells, HuH-7 cells were co-transfected with pX330-TDRD3 gRNA1, pX330-TDRD3
gRNA2, and puromycin plasmid. At the second day of culture, puromycin (2mg/ml) was
supplemented into the culture medium, and the cells with recombination of TDRD3 and PuroR
gene were selected for 3 days. Cells were subsequently seeded into 96-well plates at a density of
0.1 cells/well to generate single-cell clones. Only wells harboring a single clone were used. The
gene KO was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the TDRD gene and Western blotting as
described below. HuH-7 TOP3B KO cells were generated in the same manner.
Construction of tetracycline-inducible expression system. Stable tetracycline inducible
HEK293 cell lines expressing FLAG-TOP3B were established with the Flp-in T-REx system
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) by cotransfection of pFLAG-TOP3B and the pOG44 plasmid, which
encodes Flp recombinase,. After transfection stable transfectants are selected using 100 µg/ml of
hygromycin B and 15 µg/ml of blasticidin. Expression of the transgene was induced by the
addition of 1 µg/mL doxycycline (DOX) in the culturing media.

Immunoblotting. The HuH-7 wild-type (WT), HuH-7 TDRD3 KO, or HuH-7 TOP3B KO cells
were lysed in RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies) with 1X protease inhibitor cocktail
(Cell Signaling Technologies) and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 3 min to pellet membranous cell
debris. The cleared samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 4 to 12% Bis-Tris protein gels
and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in blocking buffer for
1 h, followed by overnight incubation with primary antibody. The blots were then washed and
incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse fluorophore/DyLight FW 800-conjugated secondary
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bands were visualized using Odyssey infrared scanner
from Li-Cor.
Virus growth assay in KO cells. 5 × 104 HuH-7 WT, TDRD3 KO or TOP3B KO cells were
seeded on 24 well plates. After 24 h of culture, the cells were infected with DENV at an MOI of
0.2, ZIKV at an MOI of 0.2. The culture supernatants were collected at the 72 hours postinfection and the virus titer was measured by plaque forming assay. For YFV cells were infected
at an MOI of 0.01, and for CVB3 at an MOI of 0.01. 72 hpi cells were stained with 4G2 mAb
(YFV) or VP1 (CVB3) primary antibody, Alexa647-conjugated anti-mouse IgG mAb as a
secondary antibody and DAPI, and the infection rate was obtained from the average of the fthree
areas and shown as % infected cells. For CHIKV infections, cells were infected at an MOI of
0.05. 72 hpi cells were washed five times with PBS and then lysed with Renilla lysis buffer
(Promega). Luciferase assays were performed using an EnSpire plate reader (PerkinElmer). For
IAV infections, HuH-7 cell monolayers were washed once with DPBS, and IAV (strain Influenza
A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1) was diluted in DPBS with 0.4% (w/v) BSA for infection at
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 PFU/cell, was incubated on cells at 37°C for 1 hr.
Inoculations were removed, cells were washed twice with DPBS, overlaid with DMEM
containing 0.4% (w/v) BSA, 0.1 µg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin, and incubated at 37°C.
Supernatants were collected for plaque assay at the indicated time points (24h, 48, 72h). Standard

plaque assays were performed as previously described (PMID:20534532). In brief, for plaque
assays, confluent monolayers of MDCK cells were washed once with DPBS. The collected
supernatants containing virus were diluted in DPBS with 0.4% (w/v) BSA, and incubated on cells
at 37°C for 1 hr. The medium was then removed, cells were washed twice with DPBS and
replaced with MEM containing 0.6% oxoid agar, 1 µg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin and incubated at
37°C for 2 days. Cells were fixed in 3.7% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in DPBS for 1 hr at
room temperature, and stained with 1% (w/v) crystal violet, 20% (v/v) methanol in DPBS for 20
minOf the IAV experiment, the supernatant was collected over time (at 24, 48, 72 h.p.i). The
virus titer was measured by plaque forming-assay.
Immunofluorescence and imaging. IFA of cells infected with DENV, YFV or CVB3 was
performed as described previously 21. Briefly, the cells were stained with 4G2 mAb as a primary
antibody, Alexa647-conjugated anti-mouse IgG mAb as a secondary antibody and DAPI. VP1
antibody was used for the primary antibody against CVB3 infected cells. IFA images of the plates
were taken with the 10× objective on an Opera Phenix High Content Screening System
(PerkinElmer) and the images were analyzed using the associated Harmony® Office Software
(PerkinElmer). Four microscopic areas per well were selected, and total and infected cells were
counted based on Alexa647 and DAPI signal. The infection rate was obtained from the average of
the four areas and shown as % infected cells.
Transfections and Rescue experiment. 5 × 104 HuH-7 WT, TDRD3 KO or TOP3B KO cells
were seeded on 24 well plates. After 24 h of culture, the cells were transfected with pGFP alone,
or pGFP-TDRD3, or pGFP-Top3B and 24 hrs later transfected cells were split into a new plate
and infected with DENV-2 at an MOI of 0.2. At 72 hr post-infection, viral titers in culture
supernatants were measured by plaque-forming assay. Expression of exogenous GFP-tagged
TDRD3 or TOP3B was confirmed by Western-blotting.

Cross-liking and Immunoprecipitation (CLIP) of TOP3B. HEK293T-FLP-In Flag-TOP3B
was seeded on a 10cm dish at the 2.2 × 106 cells/plate and cultured over-night. The culture
medium was exchanged to the medium with/without 1 µg/ml DOX to induce exogenous FlagTOP3B, and at the same time, the cells were infected with DENV-2 at an MOI of 0.1. At the 48
h.p.i., the infected cells were crosslinked with 120 mJ UV light (wavelength 254 nm), or Mocktreated, UV: (-). The cells were lysed with lysis buffer (100mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.5 % NP-40,
0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mM NaCl2, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS))
and passed through 30G needle. After the centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 15 min to pellet
membranous cell debris, the sample was diluted into 0.25 mg/ml total protein and stored.
FLAG-TOP3 and crosslinked RNA complexes were immunoprecipitated from the 500 µl of total
cell lysate by using Pierce TM Anti-DYKDDDK Magnetic Agarose beads (Thermo fisher
scientific). After the extensive washing with high-salt buffer (1M NaCl2, 100mM Tris-HCl pH
7.4, 2.5m MgCl2, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), the input cell-lysate, the depleted
supernatant after IP and 25% of the beads were analyzed with Western-blotting and induced
expression and IP were confirmed.
To degradate crosslinked proteins and release the precipitated RNA, the input cell-lysate and
remained 75% of the beads were treated with Proteinase K (NEB) for 15 min at 37 °C. RNA was
extracted with Direct-zol RNA kit (Zymo Research), reverse transcription was conducted with
random primers using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). EEF1A1 RNA (forward 5’-TTGGTTCAAGGGATGGAAAG-3’, reverse 5’TTGTCAGTTGGACGAGTTGG-3’), CELSR2 RNA (forward 5’CTCTCTGCACAGCACCAG-3’, reverse 5’-CCTTGGCCAGGGTTCAG-3’) or DENV-2
genomic RNA (forward 5’-GAAATGGGTGCCAACTTCAAGGGT-3’, reverse 5GAAATGGGTGCCAACTTCAAGGGT-3’) was detected and measured by real-time
quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) using PowerUP SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher

Scientific) in StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Primers used in
RT-qPCR are shown in Table S1. Co-precipitation of the RNA was shown as % Total RNA and
Fold Enrichment against DOX (-) condition.
Statistical analysis. In all figures, error bars represent the standard deviation (S.D.). Asterisks
denote level of statistical significance: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p<0.001 and **** p < 0.0001.
To ensure the normal distribution of the value, the virus titer was statistically analyzed after the
Log10 transfer. For the comparison of virus titer between HuH-7 WT and TDRD3 or TOP3B KO
cells, an unpaired student’s t-test was performed. This analysis was performed at each time point
in the IAV growth assay. For the side by side comparison of virus titer in HuH-7 WT, TDRD3
KO and TOP3B KO cells and rescue assay of viral replication by exogenous expression of
TDRD3 or TOP3B, Tukey’s multiple comparison test was performed after the Ordinary One-way
ANOVA. In the % Total RNA of the CLIP experiment, Dunnett’s multiple comparison test
against EEF1A1 was performed after the Ordinary One-way in each experimental condition. In
the comparison of fold enrichment of DENV-2 genomic RNA of the CLIP experiment, Tukey’s
multiple comparison test was performed after the Ordinary One-way ANOVA. Statistical
analyses were conducted in Prism8 (GraphPad Software).
