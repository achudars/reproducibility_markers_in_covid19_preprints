ABSTRACT
Memory B cell reserves can generate protective antibodies against repeated SARS-CoV-2 infections,
but with an unknown reach from original infection to antigenically drifted variants. We charted
memory B cell receptor-encoded monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from 19 COVID-19 convalescent
subjects against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and found 7 major mAb competition groups against epitopes
recurrently targeted across individuals. Inclusion of published and newly determined structures of
mAb-S complexes identified corresponding epitopic regions. Group assignment correlated with crossCoV-reactivity breadth, neutralization potency, and convergent antibody signatures. mAbs that
competed for binding the original S isolate bound differentially to S variants, suggesting the protective
importance of otherwise-redundant recognition. The results furnish a global atlas of the S-specific
memory B cell repertoire and illustrate properties conferring robustness against emerging SARS-CoV2 variants.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) CoV-2 virus has rapidly become a pandemic of historic effect. Although vaccines have been
developed in record time, new variants continue to emerge and threaten to evade immune responses.
We need to understand immune recognition of SARS-CoV-2, especially as stored in B cell memory, to
illuminate the requirements for broad protective immunity in humans. We focus on B cells, because
antibodies, a key part of the immune defense against most viruses, are sufficient to protect against
SARS-CoV-2 infection in animal models (1, 2).
Antibodies are both soluble effector molecules and the antigen-receptor component of the B cell
receptor (BCR). BCRs evolve enhanced pathogen binding through immunoglobulin (Ig) gene somatic
hypermutation (SHM) and selection in lymphoid tissue germinal centers (GCs), leading to antibody
affinity maturation (3) and generation of both antibody-secreting plasma cells (PCs) and memory B
cells. Higher avidity interactions encourage terminal differentiation of B cells into PCs; memory B
cells frequently have lower avidity but more cross-reactive specificities (4).
Both PC-derived secreted antibody and memory B cells supply immune memory to prevent repeat
infection, but with non-redundant roles. Secreted antibodies can prophylactically thwart pathogen
invasion with fixed recognition capability, while memory B cells harbor expanded pathogen
recognition capacity and can differentiate quickly into PCs to contribute dynamically to the secreted
antibody repertoire (4). Moreover, memory B cells retain plasticity to adapt to viral variants through
GC re-entry and SHM-mediated evolution (5).
The viral spike (S) glycoprotein binds ACE2 on host cells and mediates viral fusion with the host (6).
Its fusogenic activity depends on a furin-mediated cleavage, resulting in N-terminal S1 and C terminal
S2 fragments (7) and on a subsequent cleavage of S2 mediated either by cathepsins or by a serine
protease, TMPRSS2 (8). The S glycoprotein is the principal neutralizing antibody target and the focus
of most vaccines. SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies decline with time (9, 10) and can lose reactivity to
emerging variants (11). Antibodies cloned from memory B cells target the S glycoprotein in redundant
as well as unique ways, indicating cooperative and competitive recognition (12-17). Many of these
antibodies have been identified and characterized; their positions within the distribution of practical
cooperative recognition of SARS-CoV-2 S within the human memory B cell repertoire have not.

Moreover, the recognition reach of memory B cells induced by one SARS-CoV-2 strain toward
evolving stains across the major epitopic regions has not yet been defined.
We present here an unbiased global assessment of the distribution of memory B-cell encoded
antibodies among cooperative and competitive recognition clusters on the SARS-CoV-2 S
glycoprotein and assess features that direct their collaborative robustness against emerging SARSCoV-2 variants. In a comprehensive competition analysis of 152 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from
19 subjects for binding with trimeric S ectodomain, we have identified 7 recurrently targeted
competition groups -- three for antibodies with epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD), two
for epitopes on the N-terminal domain (NTD), and two for S2 epitopes. We show that these groups
represent the major practical antibody footprints, with rare antibodies outside them. We map the
clusters onto the S glycoprotein by including previously characterized antibodies and new cryo-EM
determined structures. Ig repertoire analysis indicates both divergent and convergent clones with the
competition groups.
Antibodies mapped to RBD-2 and NTD-1 were the most potent neutralizers, while the S2-1 group has
the greatest recognition breadth across CoVs. The emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly the
South Africa strain, strongly affected the antibodies in one of the RBD and one of the NTD clusters.
The mutations in those variants differently influenced affinity of antibodies within a competition
group, indicating that the depth of otherwise redundant mAbs to a given S variant confers recognition
breadth for dynamically mutating S.
RESULTS
Monoclonal antibody (mAb) isolation
To identify the general pattern of SARS-CoV-2 S recognition by memory B cells in convalescent
subjects, we sorted single CD19+ CD27+ IgG+ B cells recognizing soluble prefusion-stabilized S trimer
(Fig. 1A, Fig. S1) from 19 individuals with a history of COVID-19 (Data S1). Because less is known
about S-reactive antibodies that bind outside the RBD region, we also sorted S-reactive B cells that did
not bind RBD from 3 individuals. S-reactive B cells made up 0.2% (0.07%-0.4%) of the total B cell
population (Fig. 1A left panel), with RBD-binding cells representing about a quarter of S-reactive IgG+
B cells (Fig. 1A right panel) consistent with prior work (18).

mAb binding
We cloned cDNAs encoding Ig heavy (H) and light (L) chains from individual, sorted memory B cells
into human IgG1 and kappa or lambda vectors and expressed them in HEK 293T cells. We detected
IgG in 255 of the culture supernatants, which we used to screen for binding of SARS-CoV-2 S (Fig. 1
and fig. S2). Of the 255 IgGs, 216 bound SARS-CoV-2 S expressed by HEK 293T cells, as assayed
by flow cytometry (157 from the S+ sorting, 59 from S+/RBD- sorting) (fig. S2A) and 166 of the 216
bound recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S, as assayed by ELISA (116 from the S+ sorting, 50 from the
S+RBD- sorting).
We estimated, by ELISA and, where possible, yeast display of the subdomains (fig. S2B and C), the
proportion of mAbs that bound to RBD, NTD, and S2. Recombinant and yeast-displayed S2 protein
could have any of several conformations, and all or parts of the polypeptide chain might be disordered;
antibodies that bound S2 on ELISA plates might therefore tend to recognize linear epitopes or even the
S2 post-fusion conformation. Indeed, most of the S2-binding antibodies had relatively low ELISAdetermined affinities for intact, recombinant, prefusion S, although a few bound more tightly to S
expression on the surface of 293T cells (fig. S2D). Of the 157 S-reactive mAbs sorted with SARSCoV-2 stabilized S trimer, a total of 37 (23%) were RBD-specific as assayed by ELISA, by yeast
display, or both (Fig. 1B). We detected 16 (10%) mAbs that bound the NTD and 49 (31%) that bound
recombinant S2 (Fig. 1C). Eleven of the 49 S2 binders bound cell-surface-expressed, but not ELISAbased SARS-CoV-2 S.
We also assessed mAbs by ELISA for cross-reactivity to other CoV S glycoproteins. Those of SARS
(GenBank: MN985325.1), MERS (GenBank: JX869059.2), and common cold b-CoVs HKU1
(GenBank:Q0ZME7.1) and OC43 (GenBank: AAT84362.1) have sequences with 75.8%, 28.6%,
25.1%, and 25.5 % amino-acid identity, respectively, with SARS-CoV-2 S; the more distantly related
common cold a-CoVs, NL63 (AAS58177.1) and 229E (GenBank: AAK32191.1), just 18.3% and
20.2 %. Of the 157 S ectodomain-sorted mAbs, 47 (29.9%) bound to SARS-CoV S and 8 to other bCoV S glycoproteins. These 8 cross-reactive antibodies have higher mutation levels than do RBD,
NTD, and the other S2-binding mAbs from our cohort (Fig. 1C and D). Among the 59 S-binding mAbs
cloned from the S+RBD- sorted memory B cells, ELISA detected 23 (39%) mAbs that bound NTD (11
of which also bound NTD on yeast), 14 (23.7%) that bound S2, of which 7 (11.9%) cross-reacted with
SARS-CoV S. One mAb bound RBD (Fig. 1B and C).

Global competition analysis defines seven epitopic regions on S
We used a competition ELISA to determine pairwise overlaps of the 105 antibodies in our panel for
which we could detect signal at 1 µg/mL. By adding a biotinylated version of each mAb (1 µg/mL)
together with 100-fold excess of each of the other mAbs individually into ELISA plates pre-coated
with pre-fusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S (19), we could detect competition of mAbs with up to 100fold differences in affinity. We also included 15 published mAbs with known structures as references
(fig. S3A).
We identified seven major clusters of competing mAbs—three RBD clusters, two NTD clusters, and
two S2 clusters (fig. S3A). The three RBD clusters overlapped to varying extents, as expected for sites
on a relatively small domain. Asymmetric competition (one mAb blocks binding of another, but the
second does not block the first) occurred when one had much higher affinity than the other -- e.g.,
S309 (20), which binds more tightly than do most of the RBD-1 mAbs we isolated. The clusters define
relatively broad epitopic regions, as the footprints of two antibodies within a cluster might not overlap
with each other but both might overlap with the footprint of a third (e.g., REGN10933, REGN10987,
both of which competed with CC12.1, although they have completely distinct footprints at either end
of the RBD receptor binding motif, (RBM) (21). Some crosstalk between clusters is also evident (e.g.
C93D9, which bound the RBD, blocked both RBD-2 and NTD-1 mAbs). The published 4-8, 4A8 and
COVA1-22 mAbs (12, 13, 22), which have been shown to bind the NTD, compete with each other and
map to NTD-1. NTD-2 mAbs cluster distinctly from NTD-1, indicating minimal spatial overlap of
these two NTD regions. One NTD-1 mAb (C81H11) competed strongly with antibodies from S2-1,
and a second could be assigned on the basis of competition either to NTD-1 or to S2-1, suggesting
structural adjacency of at least some sites in these two clusters (fig. S3A). Several segments of S2 are
in contact with either RBD or NTD, some with differential exposure depending on whether the RBD is
"up" or "down".

Thirty-six mAbs in the ELISA competition analysis cross-reacted with SARS-CoV. These mapped
mostly to the RBD-1 (11 mAbs) and S2-1 (17 mAbs) clusters. Four mAbs that mapped to S2-1
(C15C3, C7A4, C7A9 and G32Q1) also bound the common cold b-CoVs, and two of these (C7A9,
C15C3) also bound MERS S. Thus, S2-1 mAbs appear to recognize a region of S2 conserved among
SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS, HKU1 and OC43, as shown previously for S2 antibodies (23, 24).

Isolation of a single mAb (C12B3) that bound S2 but did not map to any of the seven major clusters
suggests that the immune system may target additional regions of S2, but that those responses are
subdominant.
Memory B cells dominant across individuals in natural infection
We probed the relative distribution of epitopes recognized by SARS-CoV-2 specific memory B cells in
the population represented by our cohort by ELISA-based and cell surface-based assays. We clustered
all the S+ mAbs (Fig. 2) and S+RBD- mAbs from a separate sorting step (fig. S3B and C). In the former
set, comprising 73 mAbs that bound strongly enough for the ELISA competition assay, the order of
epitopic region frequencies was RBD-1 (27.4%), S2-1 (19.2%), NTD-1 (17.8%), RBD-2 (15.1%),
NTD-2 (8.2%) (Fig. 2A). There were 36 more mAbs that had insufficient affinity for ELISA
competition but that bound cell surface SARS-CoV-2 S (Fig. 2B and fig. S4A). To map ELISAinsufficient mAbs to the 7 clusters, we mixed the biotinylated antibodies with blocking antibodies
selected from the ELISA-mapped competition assays, incubated the mixture with cells expressing
SARS-CoV-2 S, and recorded the mean value florescent intensity (MFI) to calculate the blocking
strength. We used twenty mAbs (2 RBD-3, 4 RBD-2, 4 RBD-1, 2 NTD-2, 4 NTD-1, 2 S2-1 and 2 S22) from the ELISA-mapped competition clusters as blocking antibodies, a non-COVID-19 related
blocking antibody as negative control, and self-blocking as positive control (Fig. 2B and S3C). We
used an additional 118 mAbs (distributed across the 7 clusters) to map the 13 mAbs that failed to
compete with the initial 20 (fig. S4B).
Cell-based competition showed that mAbs with affinities too low to test by ELISA mapped primarily
to S2 and to the NTD (Figs 2B and S3C). Results from including ELISA-mapped antibodies in the
cell-based competition assay showed that the two assays were consistent (fig. S5A and B) and
suggested that cell-surface binding simply extended the dynamic range of the ELISA competition
assay to include less tightly binding antibodies, justifying use of the combined competition results in
subsequent analyses. This combined approach showed that frequencies of cluster-targeting mAbs from
the two individuals that contributed the most clones (C12 and G32) were largely similar to all others
(Fig. 2C).
Structural features of competition groups
We included in the competition assays, antibodies for which published structures show their interaction

with S. We also determined by cryo-EM structures of Fab fragments of four mAbs from the RBD-1
and NTD-1 clusters bound with S ectodomain, to fill gaps in the representation of antibodies from
those clusters in published work. Two of those structures are at relatively high resolution (those of Fab
C12C9, in NTD-1, and Fab G32R7, in RBD-1), a third (C81C10, at the periphery of NTD-1) at
intermediate resolution, and a fourth (12C11, in NTD-1) at much lower resolution.
RBD-1. The complex with Fab G32R7 (Fig. 3) has three RBDs in the "up" configuration, each bound
with a Fab. The epitope is part of the RBD surface that faces outwards in the "down" configuration of
the domain, but interference of the bound Fab with the NTD of the anticlockwise neighboring subunit
(as viewed from "above" the spike in the orientation generally shown) would prevent binding to a
down-oriented RBD. The connection of the RBD allows a range of orientations for the up
configuration, and association with the G32R7 Fab does not fix the orientation of the RBD, blurring
density in a 3-D reconstruction of the intact spike. Local refinement of an RBD-Fab subparticle then
yielded a map that allowed us to build a good model of the interface (Fig. 3 and figs. S6, S7). RBD
contacts are all with the heavy chain variable domain (VH), principally CDRH2, framework residues in
the C", D and E strands, and CDRH3. The unusually long CDRH3 (24 residues) also interacts with
three glycans -- one on RBD Asn343 and the others on NTD Asn122 and Asn165. Although VH
approaches the NTD closely enough to interact with the glycans, we could identify just one likely
additional contact with an NTD side-chain (Phe157). The one published RBD-1 antibody structure is
that of S309, a neutralizing antibody isolated from a convalescent SARS-CoV donor that also
neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 (20). Its contacts with the RBD do not overlap those of G32R7, but the light
chain of the latter would collide with it.
RBD-2 and RBD-3. Most potently neutralizing antibodies cluster in RBD-2; many published structures
show modes of antibody binding within this group (25, 26). Their epitopes include various parts of the
ACE2 binding site (i.e. the RBM) at one apex of the domain. For the antibodies characterized here,
low resolution structure of Fab C12A2 showed that its epitope was essentially identical to that of
published antibody 2-4 (12). The same IGVH encodes the heavy chains of both antibodies, and the
light-chain genes are closely related (overall amino-acid sequence identity). They contact the slight
concavity in the center of the RBM, the site for most of the neutralizing antibodies represented by
structures in the PDB. The probably immunosubdominant RBD3 class includes several antibodies for
which published structures are available; we included CR3022, an antibody originally isolated from a

SARS-CoV convalescent subject that cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-2 (27). Its epitope on the RBD is
nearly opposite that of G32R7 (Fig. 3), in an epitopic region partly occluded in the down configuration
of the RBD previously referred to as a "cryptic supersite" (26).
NTD-1. NTD-1-cluster antibodies vary in neutralizing strength from strong (e.g., C12C9) to weak
(C12C11). The latter, judging from the low-resolution map (fig. S8) appears to have a footprint that
coincides with that of the published 4A8 antibody (PDB ID: 7C2L; (22)). Like the G32R7 complex,
the C12C9 complex also required local subparticle refinement to yield a map interpretable at the level
of side-chain contacts at the Fab-NTD interface. Its footprint overlaps that of 4A8, but it is displaced
slightly toward the threefold axis of the S trimer. Both antibodies have principal contacts in two NTD
surface loops, residues 140-160 and 245-260. The C81C10 mAb, which we have grouped in NTD-1
but which competes with only two of the most weakly binding members of that cluster, appears to
represent a distinct and potentially subdominant subset. An 8 Å resolution structure (fig. S8) bound
with spike trimer shows that its epitope is at the "bottom' of the NTD, well displaced from the epitopes
of C12C9, C12C11 and 4A8.
NTD-2. We have so far no structures of NTD-2 antibodies bound with spike, but from noncompetition with NTD-1, insensitivity to NTD loop deletions (see below), and exposure of NTD
surfaces on the trimer, we suggest that the NTD-2 epitopes may be on one of the lateral faces of the
NTD.
Representation of neutralizing antibodies in RBD and NTD clusters
Using two different pseudovirus assays, we determined neutralization by mAbs from each of the 7
clusters and found neutralizing antibodies in 5 of the 7 clusters (RBD-1, -2, -3, NTD-1, and NTD-2)
(fig. S9). The most potent were in RBD-2, as expected from their co-clustering with known strong
neutralizers such as REGN10987 and REGN10933, which are used as a mAb drug cocktail (28) and
from many previous reports (12, 13, 29). Among Abs from that cluster, 52-58% neutralized with
IC50<0.1 µg/ml and 28.5-35% with IC80<0.1 µg/ml (fig. S9D). The strongest of the RBD-1 antibodies
had IC50 in the range of 1 µg/ml; those in RBD-3 were in general much weaker. NTD-1 antibodies
appeared more sensitive to the neutralization assay used, but a few, such as C12C9, approached or
exceeded the strongest in RBD-1 (fig. S9A). NTD-2 antibodies were in general less potent than NTD-1

antibodies, and none of the S2 antibodies neutralized infection, with the possible exception of very
weak neutralization by G32C5 (IC50 of 22 ug/ml) (fig. S9C).
Molecular features of mAb recognition groups
Variable region exons of IgH and IgL genes are each assembled by V(D)J recombination from a
diversity of gene segments. Preference of VH gene segment usage frequencies differed among the 7
mAb clusters (Fig. 4A). Enrichment for VH3-53, previously reported to be associated with SARSCoV-2 S (21), was exclusively within the RBD-2 group. VH3 family antibodies are particularly
abundant in all the clusters. VH3-30 and VH3-30-3, which have average frequency in the general
human repertoire of 5.4% and 1.3% respectively, account between them for over 30% of the antibodies
in RBD-1, and for 16 of the 19 antibodies in S2-2. The VH1 and VH4 families are co-dominant with
VH3 in NTD-1 and NTD-2, respectively (Fig. 4A). VH1-69 encoded antibodies are enriched in S2-1,
which contains most of the cross-reactive antibodies to other coronaviruses. VH1-69 encoded
antibodies are frequently observed in antiviral responses to influenza virus, HCV, and HIV-1 (30), and
previous work reported that SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific mAbs isolated from SARS-CoV infected
patients also showed an enriched VH1-69 gene segment usage (31). VH1-69, which is well represented
in heavy chains of "natural antibodies", also associates strongly with polyreactivity. VH and VL
somatic mutation levels were generally, but not significantly, greater in S2-1 (fig. S10A)
IgH and IgL variable regions harbor three complementary determining regions (CDRs), which serve as
principal contact sites for antigen. CDRs 1 and 2 for H and L chain are encoded within the VH and VL
gene segments, respectively. Highly diverse, non-templated sequences produced by VDJH junctions
encode CDRH3 regions, which have dominant roles in most Ab-antigen interactions. CDRL3, which
can contribute antigen contact surfaces, is also diverse due to VJL junctional heterogeneity, but has less
non-templated sequence additions. Intracluster mAb CDR3 sequence comparisons showed little
sequence similarity (fig. S10B). NTD-2 contained a subcluster of identical CDRL3 sequences that
were associated with the same VH and VL segments from two different individuals (C81, C12) (Fig.
4B). S2-1 had a small subcluster of CDRH3 and CDRL3 sequence similarities from 5 different study
participants (C83, C102, C163, C12, C53) (Fig. 4B). These data indicate substantial intracluster CDR3
diversity with rare instances of CDR3 sequence similarity between different individuals.

We also asked whether we could find sequences very similar (i.e. convergent) to any in our dataset,
from other COVID-19 data sets for which paired IgH and IgL sequence data are available. Based on
prior convergent sequence analysis (32), our criteria for convergence were (i) same VH and VL, and
(ii) no less than 50% CDRH3 and CDRL3 identity, These criteria identified rare sequences very
similar to representatives from RBD-1, RBD-2, and NTD-1 in independent datasets for SARS-CoV-2
(1, 12, 33), but not for antibodies against Zika (34) or influenza (35) viruses (Fig. 4C, D). We also
found convergent pairs within our own dataset representing both S2-1 and S2-2 (Fig. 4D).
Finally, we note that antibody C93D9 represents a striking example of structural convergence. All but
two of the 20 antibodies from the literature shown in fig. S11C have the same VH and a non-random
selection of VL but divergent CDRH3 sequences and lengths. Nonetheless, all 20, as well as C93D9,
bind the RBM in almost identical poses—consistent with germline encoded CDRs as the principal
binding contacts (21).
Reactivity of the anti-S memory B cell repertoire for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants
Emergence of SARS CoV-2 variants that enhance transmissibility, such as the variant B.1.1.7 (i.e. the
UK variant) (36), and in some cases reduce the neutralization titers of convalescent sera, such as the
variant B.1.351 (i.e. South Africa (SA) variant) (37), indicates more rapid evolution of the virus than
expected from the error-correcting properties of coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. In
the case of the SA variant in particular, the clusters of three substitutions and one deletion in the NTD
and three substitutions in the RBD concentrate at contacts of the most potent of the many wellcharacterized neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, recurrent deletions in loops of the NTD appear to
accelerate SARS CoV-2 antigenic evolution (38).
We examined the effects of naturally occurring mutant spike protein on binding of mAbs in each
competition group. The UK variant had lower affinity for various mAbs in the RBD-1 and NTD-1
cluster. None of the RBD-1 mAbs lost binding completely, and testing a variant with just the deletion
at position 144 in the NTD showed that this single mutation caused loss of binding by nearly twothirds of the mAbs in the NTD-1 cluster. Mutations in the variant B.1.351 had more pronounced
effects, particularly on mAbs in the RBD-2 and NTD-1 clusters, as expected from the positions of the
sequence changes. In addition to the N501Y substitution also present in the variant B.1.1.7, an E484K
mutation lies at the center of the epitope for many of the most potent RBD-2 neutralizing antibodies.

About one-third of the RBD-2 mAbs retained modest to high affinity, but the variant spike failed to
bind any of the NTD-1 cluster, with the marginal exception of 4A8.
Differential effects on antibodies with overlapping but still distinct epitopes illustrate the potential
importance of a redundant, polyclonal response. Although C12C9, C12C11, and 4A8 all contact the
140-160 loop (Fig. 3 and S7) and all are sensitive to the multi-position, D141-144 and D243-244,
recurrent deletions, only the latter two are sensitive to the recurrent, single-position deletions at 144 or
146 (Fig. 5 and fig. S12). Moreover, although they are in the same convergent structural class whose
members bind the RBM in nearly identical poses (fig. S11), CC12.1 fails to recognize B.1.351 (~0%)
while C93D9 retains some marginal affinity (~27%) (Fig. 5). Thus, apparently redundant memory B
cell clones can have non-redundant functional roles.
DISCUSSION
Our results illustrate the landscape of memory B cell coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein in
convalescent donors. Unlike the terminally differentiated plasma cells that determine the profile of
serum antibodies, memory B cells will clonally expand upon re-exposure to antigen, some
differentiating into fresh antibody secreting cells and others re-entering germinal centers and
undergoing further SHM-mediated diversification and affinity maturation. These outcomes offer a
layer of flexibility for adaptation to drifted or related viral strains, if available secreted antibodies fail
to prevent initial infection. Loss of protection against overt or severe disease is not an inevitable
consequence of a waning serum antibody titer. This atlas of B cell memory therefore maps
systematically a crucial component of the long-term immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The donors for this study experienced COVID-19 symptom onset between March 3 and April 1, 2020,
and blood draws analyzed here were between April 2 and May 13, 2020, early in the pandemic.
Immune responses in these SARS-CoV-2 naive donors were to early and relatively homogeneous
variants circulating well before emergence of the UK and SA strains first reported in Dec. 2020 and
probably before the spread, in New England, of the D614G variant that in any case did not
substantially alter antigenicity (39, 40) . This set of BCR sequences and corresponding mAbs thus
represents responses to a relatively homogeneous infectious virus and provides a valuable tool for
examining the degree to which these antibodies retain recognition of emerging variants and for
studying the extent to which loss of neutralizing titer correlates with loss of longer-term protection.

The competition clusters we have identified are roughly analogous to genetic complementation groups.
Competition can result from overlapping binding footprints or non-overlapping but neighboring
footprints that lead to mutual exclusion of IgGs bound at the two adjacent epitopes. Competition can
also result from stabilization by one antibody of a conformation (e.g., the up-down conformational
isomerism of the RBD) that excludes or lowers affinity of the another. Any of these mechanisms may
contribute to the clusters we have mapped, but the outcome in all cases is an apparent redundancy of
binding capacity in a broadly polyclonal response that may nonetheless impart recognition breadth
toward an evolving pathogen within a single individual.
Complementary recognition of non-overlapping viral targets by non-competing antibodies in the
repertoire can reduce the likelihood of viral escape (41). Our data suggest an additional mechanism for
preventing viral escape: competing antibodies may help retain recognition of a rapidly evolving
antigen by their differential sensitivity to specific mutations. The potential dynamic reach of otherwise
redundant mAb recognition, illustrated by selective retention of affinity for the UK variant by some
antibodies within a cluster but not by others, may give selective advantage to immune mechanisms that
yield multiple competing antibodies to critical epitopes, as those that retain adequate affinity can then
re-activate, expand, and potentially undergo further affinity maturation. The emergence of strains that
may have gained selective advantage by escape from neutralization emphasizes the importance of
determining whether the level of retained affinity for the S protein by some antibodies in the
immunodominant clusters influences protection from clinical disease.

for each mAb was first normalized ("normalized IgG MFI") by dividing the MFI for that mAb by the
MFI for C81E2 (S2-2 cluster). The normalized MFI of for binding the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike was used as
a reference (normalized Wuhan IgG MFI). The relative binding intensities of the tested mAbs for each
variant, calculated as the ratio of the normalized variant IgG MFI and the normalized Wuhan IgG MFI,
are shown in shades of blue.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Materials and Methods
Human samples
The study and protocol were approved by Partners Institutional Review Board. Volunteers aged 18 and
older with a history of COVID-19 were enrolled between March and May 2020. COVID-19 was
diagnosed by a healthcare professional based on symptoms and a positive nasopharyngeal swab RTPCR test except for G32, who was diagnosed by an antibody test. Participants self-reported data for
body-mass index (BMI), symptom onset and recovery dates and self-rated the severity of their
COVID-19 symptoms on a 1-10 scale, with 1 describing very mild symptoms and 10 describing very
severe symptoms. Blood samples were collected at least 2 weeks after symptom resolution. Symptom
duration is the time between symptom onset and recovery dates. Detailed information about the cohort
is in Data S1. BMI was calculated as participant’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of their
height in meters. Blood samples were processed within 4 hours of sample collection. PBMCs and
plasma samples were isolated by density gradient centrifugation with Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE
Healthcare) and stored at -80°C until use.
SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific single B cell sorting
B cells, enriched from PBMCs with human CD19 MicroBeads (Miltenyi), were incubated with 2 ug/
ml flag-tagged S protein or mixture of flag-tagged S protein (Genscript, Cat. Z03481) and His-tagged
RBD (10) on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were then washed with 2% FBS (Hyclone) in PBS and stained
with mixture of anti-human IgG (Percpcy5.5; Biolegend Cat. 410710), anti-human IgD (FITC;
Biolegend Cat. 348205), anti-human IgM (Bv605; Biolegend Cat. 314524), anti-CD27 (APCcy7;
Biolegend Cat. 356404). A mixture of PE- and APC-conjugated anti-flag antibodies (Biolegend Cat.
637309 and 637307) was also added for gating S-specific double positive cells, or a mixture of PEconjugated anti-His (Biolegend Cat. 362603) and APC-conjugated anti-flag, for S positive and RBD
negative cells. Memory B-cells were gated on DAPI-CD19+IgM-IgD-IgG+CD27+. Individual S double
positive or S+RBD- cells were sorted with a FACSAria Fusion (BD Biosciences) into each well of 96well microplates containing 4 μl/well of lysis buffer (0.5X PBS, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 4U
RNaseOUT). Lysed cells were immediately frozen and stored at -80 ˚C until use.
Antibody cloning and production
Cloning and expression of mAbs from single, SARS-CoV-2 S-specific B-cells were performed as
described previously (10). In brief, mRNA from lysed B cells was reverse transcribed with SuperScript
III (ThermoFisher) and random hexamers. Two rounds of PCR were performed to amplify heavy and
light chain transcripts. Amplified products from the second round PCR were detected by agarose gel
and further verified by Sanger sequencing. Sequences were analyzed with IgBlast
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/), and sequence confirmed PCR products were then amplified
with gene specific primers containing restriction enzyme sites for cloning into human IgG1, kappa and
lambda expression vectors (gifts from Michel C. Nussenzweig, Rockefeller University). For small
scale antibody production, paired heavy and light chains were co-transfected into HEK 293T cells
(ATCC, Cat. CRL-3216) in 6-well plates with Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher, Cat. L3000015)
following manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and incubated at 37oC with 5% CO2. The medium was replaced with fresh
medium at 12 hours post-transfection and the supernatant harvested after 48 hours. Cell debris were
removed by centrifugation at 2000 g for 10 min and the cleared supernatant stored at 4oC for further
use.

For large scale antibody production, paired heavy chain and light chain were co-transfected in
Expi293F cells (ThermoFisher, Cat. A14527) with ExpiFectamine (ThermoFisher, Cat. A14525) in
250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks following manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were cultured in Expi293
expression medium at 37oC and 8% CO2 with shaking at 125 RPM. On day 7, cells were removed by
centrifuging at 2000 RPM for 10 min. Clear supernatants were incubated overnight at 4°C with protein
A agarose beads (ThermoFisher, Cat. 20334), followed by washing with PBS, elution with 0.1 M
Glycine (pH 2.7) and neutralization with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Purified antibodies were dialyzed
against PBS for further use.
Monoclonal antibody screening with ELISA
SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the RBD proteins of other coronaviruses were prepared as described (10).
SARS-CoV-2 S2 and NTD proteins were purchased from Sino biological (PA, USA). ELISA was
carried out as described (10). Briefly, MaxiSorp 96-well ELISA plates (ThermoFisher) were coated
with 50 ng/well of the antigen in PBS at 4oC overnight. Plates were blocked with 150 µl of 4% BSA in
PBS for at least 2 hours. Supernatant of antibody-expressing cells was diluted 10-fold for the first well
and 4-fold serial diluted for subsequent wells, applied to the plates, and incubated at 4oC overnight.
Plates were washed 4 times with PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST). Anti-human IgGalkaline phosphatase (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) at a final concentration of 1µg/ml in 1%
BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 was added at 50 µl/well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature.
Plates were washed three times with PBST. Developing solution (0.1 M Glycine, pH 10.4, with 1 mM
MgCl2 and 1 mM ZnCl2, containing alkaline phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (SigmaAldrich) at final concentration of 1.6 mg/mL) was then added to the plates at 100 µl/well, and
incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm by microplate reader
(Biotek Synergy H1).
For half maximal effective concentration (EC50) and area under curve (AUC) analysis of antibody
binding by ELISA, 5-fold serial dilutions were produced from an initial concentration of 10 µg/ml of
purified antibody in the ELISA procedure described above. EC50 and AUC were calculated with
GraphPad Prism 9.
Cell surface binding assays
Antibodies were tested for binding to surface-expressed SARS-CoV-2 spike, RBD, and NTD on HEK
293 T cells (spike) and on yeast (RBD, NTD). For yeast expressing, RBD and, RBD (aa 319-529) and
NTD (aa 17-286) were cloned into a pCHA vector (gift of K. Dane Wittrup, Koch Institute for
Integrative Cancer Research, MIT, Cambridge, MA). Plasmids were chemically transformed into yeast
cell line EBY100 to display RBD or NTD as previously described (10). Briefly, single clones were
cultured in SDCAA selection medium for 48 hours at 30 oC and 250 RPM. Cells were pelleted and
resuspended in SGCAA medium to an absorbance of 0.5-1 at 600 nm, cultured at 20oC with shaking at
250 RPM for another 48 hours to induce expression. RBD and NTD were detected by anti-c-Myc IgY
antibody (ThermoFisher, Cat. A21281). Yeast expressing RBD or NTD were incubated with antibody
supernatant and anti-c-Myc IgY on ice for 30 minutes and then washed with PBS with 2% FBS twice.
Cells were then stained with goat anti-chicken IgG (Alexa Fluor 488, ThermoFisher, A11039) and goat
anti-human IgG (Alexa Fluro 647, ThermoFisher, A21445) on ice for 15 min, followed by washing
twice with PBS supplemented with 2% FBS (FACS buffer). Cells were resuspended in FACS buffer
and detected by flow cytometry (BD Canto II). Data were analyzed by FlowJo 10.7.1. For analysis of
antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 S on HEK 293 T cells, a plasmid containing Wuhan-Hu-1 S (HDMSARS2-spike-delta21, Addgene, Cat. 155130) was co-transfected with pmaxGFP (Lonza) in HEK

293T cells using Lipofectamine 3000. Fresh medium was added at 24 hours, and cells were harvested
at 48 hours post-transfection in PBS with 2 mM EDTA. Cells were stained with antibody supernatant
on ice for 1 hour, washed twice with FACS buffer, and stained with goat anti-human IgG (Alexa Fluro
647 ThermoFisher, A21445) and DAPi (to distinguish dead and live cells). After washing twice with
FACS buffer, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer and detected by flow cytometry (BD Canto II).
S+ cells were identified by gating on DAPi-GFP+. Data were analyzed in FlowJo 10.7.1. For half
maximal effective concentration (EC50) of antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 S in the cell-based assay,
eight three-fold serial dilutions of purified antibody were produced starting from 10 µg/ml, followed
by flow cytometric binding analysis as above. EC50 was calculated with GraphPad Prism 9.
ELISA-based antibody competition
The competition assay was performed as described (12). Briefly, detection antibodies were biotinylated
with EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (ThermoFisher) according to manufacturer’s protocol. 50
ng/well of SARS-CoV-2 S protein were coated on ELISA plates at 4 oC overnight. Plates were blocked
with 150 ul of 4% BSA in PBS for 2 hours. 30 µl of 2 µg/ml biotinylated antibody were mixed with 30
µl of 200 µg/ml blocking antibody and added to ELISA plates. For antibody competition with hACE2
(aa18-615), 100 ng/well hACE2 were coated on ELISA plates at 4 oC overnight. Plates were blocked
with 4% BSA, and a mixture of 30 µl of 2 µg/ml Twin-Strep-tag HexaPro S (42) and 30 µl of 200
µg/ml blocking antibody was then added. Plates were incubated for 2 hrs at 37°C and washed 4 times
with PBST. 50 µl/well of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (BD Biosciences, Cat. 554065) was added
to the wells using a dilution of 1:1000 dilution of the stock solution according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed 5 times with PBST and
developed at room temperature for 2 hours. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm by microplate reader
(Biotek Synergy H1). The detection signal was calculated by (OD value of mixture antibodies-OD
value of PBS)/ (OD value of biotinylated antibody alone-OD value of PBS) x100%. Negative values
were treated as 100% competition.
Cell-based antibody competition
S (HDM-SARS2-spike-delta21, Addgene, Cat. 155130) and GFP (pmaxGFP) was co-expressed in
HEK 293T cells. 30 µl of 2 µg/ml biotinylated antibody were mixed with 30 µl of 200 µg/ml blocking
antibody and added to cells. After 1-hour incubation on ice, followed by washing twice with FACS
buffer, cells were stained with 50 µl of 1:1000 diluted DyLight 649 Streptavidin (BioLegend, Cat.
405224) and DAPi. After washing twice with FACS buffer, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer
and detected by flow cytometry (BD Canto II). S+ cells were gated on DAPi-GFP+. Data were
analyzed by FlowJo 10.7.1. The detection signal was calculated by (MFI of mixture antibodies-MFI of
PBS)/ (MFI of biotinylated antibody alone-MFI of PBS) x100%. Negative values were treated as
100% competition.
Antibody binding to S variants
Variants included: Wuhan-Hu-1 S (HDM-SARS2-spike-delta21-D614G, Addgene, Cat. 158762),
recurring NTD deletions as described (38) (D69-70, D141-144, D144, D146, D210, D243-24),
Nextstrain cluster 20A.EU1 (A222V), Danish mink variant (D 69-70 and Y453F), UK B.1.1.7 (D69-70,
D144, N501Y, A570D, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H) and SA B.1.351 (L18F, D80A, D215G,
D242-244, K417N, E484K, N501Y, A701V). We note that plasmids with D144 and D145 have the
same coding sequence due to the presence of tyrosine at both sites. All variants contain D614G. For
binding, 10 µg/ml of antibody were incubated with cells, with goat anti-human IgG as secondary
antibody for detection by flow cytometry (BD Canto II). S+ cells were gated on DAPi-GFP+. Data

were analyzed by FlowJo 10.7.1. Antibodies were first normalized for each spike variant (normalized
IgG MFI), by dividing MFI of tested mAb by MFI of C81E2 reactive to the S2 region. Normalized
MFI of Wuhan-Hu-1 S was used as a reference (normalized Wuhan IgG MFI). Relative binding
intensity of the tested mAb for different variants was calculated as the ration of normalized variant IgG
MFI to normalized Wuhan IgG MFI. Relative binding signal > 1 was treated as no loss of binding and
set to 1.
Pseudovirus production and neutralization assay
Pseudovirus particles were produced as described (43). HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with spike
envelope plasmid (HDM-SARS2-spike- D21, Addgene, Cat. 155130), package plasmid (psPAX2,
Addgene, Cat. 12260) and backbone plasmid (pLenti CMV Puro LUC, Addgene, Cat. 17477) with
Lipofectamine 3000. Medium was replaced with fresh medium at 24 hours, and supernatants were
harvested at 48 hours post-transfection and clarified by centrifugation at 300g for 10 min before
aliquoting and storing at -80°C. SARS-Cov-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay was performed as
described (44), with target cell line 293FT expressing human ACE2 and serine protease TMPRSS2
(provided by Marc C. Johnson, University of Missouri) or TZM.bl expressing human ACE2. Cells at
1.8 x 104 cell/well were seeded in 96-well plates 16 hours in advance. Serial diluted mAb was mixed
with pseudovirus and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C before adding to cells. Cells infected without mAb
were scored as 100% infection; cells cultured without pseudovirus or mAb as blank controls. After 48
hours incubation at 37oC with 5% CO2, cells were processed with luminescent regent (ONE-GloTM,
Promega) according to manufacturer’s instructions, and luminescence (RLU) was measured with a
microplate reader (Biotek Synergy H1). Inhibition was calculated by 100-(RLU of mAb-RLU of
blank)/ (RLU of pseudovirus -RLU of blank) x100%. Values for half inhibition (IC50) and 80%
inhibition (IC80) were calculated with GraphPad Prism 9.
Authentic virus neutralization assay
Cell Culture: NR-596 VeroE6 cells (BEI Resources) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle
medium (DMEM) (Gibco™) with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco™), GlutaMAX
(Gibco™), non-essential amino acids (Gibco™) and sodium pyruvate (Gibco™). One day prior to the
assay, VeroE6 cells were seeded at a density of 8.0 x 105 cells per well of a 6-well plate (Falcon™
Polystyrene Microplates, Cat. 353934) in 2 mL media.
Virus propagation: Passage 4 SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 was received from the University of
Texas Medical Branch. A T225 flask of VeroE6 cells was inoculated with 90µL starting material in
15mL DMEM/2 % HI-FBS (Gibco™). The inoculated flasks were incubated in a humidified incubator
at 37oC/5% CO2 with periodic rocking for 1 hour. After 1 hour, 60mL of DMEM/2% HI-FBS
(Gibco™) was added without removing the inoculum and flasks were then incubated again at 37°C/5%
CO2. Flasks were observed daily for progression of CPE and stock was harvested at 66 hours postinoculation. Stock supernatant was harvested and clarified by centrifugation at 5,250 RCF at 4°C for
10 minutes and heat inactivated fetal bovine serum concentration (Gibco™) was increased to a final
concentration of 10%.
Viral neutralization reduction assays were performed at biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) at the National
Emerging Infectious Disease Laboratories (NEIDL). An Avicel plaque reduction assay was used to
quantify plaques. Antibody samples were serially diluted in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline
(DPBS)(Gibco™) using two-fold dilutions. Dilutions were prepared in triplicate per antibody and
plated in triplicate. Each dilution was incubated at 37 ℃ and 5% CO2 for 1 hour with 1000 plaque
forming units/ml (PFU/ml) of SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-WA1/2020). Controls included DPBS as a

negative control and 1000 PFU/ml SARS-CoV-2 incubated with DPBS. The maintenance medium was
removed from each plate and 200 µL of each inoculum dilution was added to confluent monolayers of
NR-596 Vero E6 cells (including a positive and mock negative control) in triplicate and incubated for
1 hour at 37°C/5% CO2 with gentle rocking every 10-15 minutes to prevent monolayer drying. The
overlay was prepared by mixing by inversion Avicel 591 overlay (DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences,
Wilmington, DE) and 2X Modified Eagle Medium (Temin’s modification, Gibco™) supplemented
with 2X antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco™), 2X GlutaMAX (Gibco™) and 10% fetal bovine serum
(Gibco™) in a 1:1 ratio. After 1 hour, 2 mL of overlay was added to each well and the plates was
incubated for 48 hours at 37°C/5% CO2. 6-well plates were then fixed using 10% neutral buffered
formalin prior to removal from BSL-4 space. The fixed plates were then stained with 0.2% aqueous
Gentian Violet (RICCA Chemicals, Arlington, TX) in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 30 min,
followed by rinsing and plaque counting. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were
calculated using GraphPad Prism 8.
Fab preparation
Fab fragments were overexpressed with a His-tag heavy chain expression vector and co-transfected
with a light chain vector in Expi293F cells. Fab fragments were also produced by papain digestion
with a Fab preparation kit (ThermoFisher, Cat. 44985) according to manufacturer’s protocol. In brief,
0.5-1.0 mg of IgG1 antibodies were mixed with 125 μl papain resin (ThermoFisher, Cat. 20341) for 5
hours in the digestion buffer provided, containing 20 mM cysteine, pH 7.4. Undigested antibody and
Fc fragments were removed by incubating digested products with a protein A column overnight at 4
o
C, then collecting the Fab-containing flow-through. Fabs were analyzed by 4-20 % Tris-Glycine SDSPAGE (ThermoFisher, Cat. XP04200BOX).
Statistical analysis
Competition clusters were processed in two steps. The mAbs were first grouped based on binding to
SARS-CoV-2 subdomains (RBD, NTD, S2). These mAbs, together with ungrouped mAbs, were then
clustered based n competition in ELISA or in the cell-based assay, taking reduction of signal by 30%
as the competition threshold.
In order to determine the presence of epitope dependent, VH-segment preferential usage, we used
resampling to bootstrap p-values. For each cluster with size n, we resampled n VH segments from the
observed VH segments in our dataset m times with replacement. P-values were generated by counting
the number of resampled clusters for which the frequency of a VH-segment matched or exceeded the
frequency observed in the 167 S binders in Data S2, dividing the quantity of these instances by the
number of trials m, and performing a Bonferroni correction (e.g. multiplying the p-value by the
number of unique VH-segments) (45). For these data, the 7 clusters range from 5 to 39 members, and 1
million resampled clusters were generated for each cluster. We also used the same methods to compare
the VH-segment composition of each cluster to the VH-segment composition of the general human
PBMC repertoire, exchanging the weights of the unique VH-segments with their representation in the
averaged general repertoire from 10 healthy controls (46).
Public clones were screened from previously reported clones with a total of 616 SARS-CoV-2 related
clones (1, 12, 22, 33). We also screened 133 Zika (34) and 98 Flu (H1N1) (35) related clones. Public
clones converged on identical VH and VL alleles, with at least 50% identity in CDRL3 and 50%
identity in CDRH3.

Plasmids encoding stabilized variants 2P (19) and hexapro (42) of SARS-CoV2 S protein were gifts
from Jason McLellan (University of Texas, Austin). Spike proteins for electron microscopy were
expressed in Expi293F cells grown in Expi293 medium after transfection with spike-encoded plasmid
DNA using the Expifectamine 293 transfection kit (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). Cells were grown
for 6 days before subjecting conditioned media to affinity chromatography following centrifugation
and 0.2 μm filtration. The 2P variant of spike was applied first to a Talon cobalt resin (Takara Bio) and
eluted with 200 mM imidazole followed by purification over a S200 size exclusion chromatography
column (Cytiva). Alternatively, the hexapro variant of spike was applied to a Streptactin resin (IBA
Life Sciences), eluted with 2.5 mM desthiobiotin, and used without further purification.
Antibodies were also expressed in Expi293 as described for spike. C12C9 and C12A2 Fabs were
prepared by expressing Fabs with a 3C-cleavable histag that was removed using 3C protease (Pierce)
following Talon resin purification, as described (47). Fabs of C93D9, G32R7, and C81C10 were
prepared by papain cleavage of IgG purified by Protein G affinity chromatography and the Fab
collected as the flow through from the same resin.
Spike variants and Fabs were exchanged into 10 mM Tris buffer pH 7.5 with 150 mM NaCl for storage
at 4°C.
Cryo-EM grid preparation
Grids were glow discharged (PELCO easiGlow) for 30 seconds at 15 mA and prepared with a Gatan
Cryoplunge 3 by applying 3.5 uL of sample and blotting for 4.0 seconds in the chamber maintained at
a humidity between 86% and 90%. Protein complexes were formed with spike and a 3-fold excess of
Fab one hour before freezing and applied with without further purification.
Preliminary studies on 2P S protein complexes with C12C11 were performed with 1.2 mg/ml total
protein and C-flat 1.2-1.3 400 Cu mesh grids (Protochips). Structures of C12A2 and C12C9 bound
with 2P S protein were determined using Quantifoil 1.2-1.3 400 mesh Cu grids and 0.5 mg/mL total
protein, the former with 0.1% w/v octyl β-D-glucopyranoside to reduce orientation bias. Structures of
C93D9, G32R7, and C81C10 with hexapro S protein were prepared with thick C-flat 1.2-1.3 400 Cu
mesh grids and 1.2 mg/mL total protein.
Cryo-EM image recording
Images for C12C11 complexes were recorded on a Talos Arctica microscope operated at 200 keV with
a Gatan K3 direct electron detector. Images for C12A2, C12C9, and G32R7 complexes were recorded
on a Titan Krios microscope operated at 300 keV with a Gatan BioQuantum GIF/K3 direct electron
detector. Images for C93D9 and C81C10 were recorded on an FEI Technai F20 microscope operated at
200 keV with a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector. Automated recording was with Serial EM
(48) in all cases. Specifications and statistics for images from each of these complexes are in Table S1.
Cryo-EM image analysis and 3D reconstruction
Image analysis for all structures was carried out in RELION (49). Beam-induced motion correction of
micrograph movies was performed with UCSF MotionCor2 (50) followed by contrast transfer function
estimation with CTFFIND-4.1 (51), both as implemented in RELION. Particles were picked from
motion corrected micrographs using crYOLO (52). A general model was used to pick particles from
datasets collected on the Talos Acrtica and Titan Krios; a specific model was trained to pick particles
from F20 micrographs.

Extracted particles were downsampled and subjected 2D classification, two rounds for the Titan Krios
datasets. Initial models were prepared, and the best of three was used as a reference for 3D
classification with C3 symmetry imposed. For the Talos Actica and F20 datasets, all particles from
reasonable classes were combined and subjected to 3D autorefinement and sharpening, yielding final
reconstructions at 8-11Å resolution. The Titan Krios datasets for C12C9 and G32R7 required
additional rounds of 3D classification and 3D autorefinement to converge to final C3-symmetric, full
particle reconstructions of 3.0 and 3.6 Å nominal resolutions for C12C9 and G32R7, respectively, but
with much lower resolution for the Fab-bound domains. We therefore carried out local refinement as
follows. Particle stacks from the final C3-symmetric, full particle maps were symmetry expanded and
back projected to create a new C3-expanded reconstruction. Models of the most similar heavy and light
chains were extracted from the protein data bank and combined to create initial models for the Fabs of
C12C9 (heavy: 5ggu, light: 6ghg) and G32R7 (heavy: 4qf1, light: 7byr). Fab models and the NTD
(residues 14-290 of 7c2l) were docked into the reconstructed maps; the RBD from 7bz5 was also
docked into the G32R7 map. These docked PDB models were used to prepare initial masks with a
sphere radius of 8 Å using NCSMASK and a soft edge of 5 pixels, added with relion_mask_create.
The soft mask was then used to make a background-subtracted, subparticle stack as implemented in
RELION. Fab-occupied and well-resolved subparticles were identified with 3D classification without
alignment. Further rounds of 3D classification with and without alignment were carried out along with
3D autorefinement to obtain final sharpened maps with resolutions of ~4.0 Å for both C12C9 and
G32R7 Fabs. Detailed descriptions of the particle processing are in fig. S6 and statistics, including
model refinement, are in Table S1. Fourier shell correlations are in fig. S7.

(A) Maps and models. Because the resolution was too low for de novo modeling, we docked the
following structures (identified by PDB IDs) into the reconstructed maps, based on similarity of heavyand light-chain variable domain sequences: 6B0S and 7KJ5 (for Fab and spike, respectively, in
C12C11 reconstruction; only a single spike subunit is shown, and the NTD was adjusted manually
after 7KJ5 fitting with Chimera "fit-in-map"); 7B3O (for Fab and RBD, docked together, with 6VXX
for the rest of the spike, in C93D9 reconstruction); 4QF1 and 6VXX (for Fab and spike in C81C10
reconstruction; only a single spike subunit is shown, and the NTD was adjusted manually after 6VXX
fitting with Chimera "fit-in-map"). (B) Fourier shell correlation plots for the corresponding maps. The
nominal resolutions (0.143 criterion) are 12 Å, 7.1 Å, and 8 Å for C12C11, C93D9 and C81C10,
respectively.

distances analyzed by Mega X. Intensity of color shows the distance, from 0 (identical) to 1 (no
identity). The VH and VL genes encoding the antibodies are shown in the indicated groups.
Differences in CDR3s from the reference sequences (bold) are in red; dashes indicate missing amino
acids; dots represent identical amino acids. IGHV3-66 and IGHV3-53 are very similar VH gene
segments, differing by only one encoded amino-acid residue.
