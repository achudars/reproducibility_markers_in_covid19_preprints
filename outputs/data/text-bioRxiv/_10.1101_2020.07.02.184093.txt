Abstract

52

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a worldwide health threat.

53

Here, we report that low plasma interleukin-3 (IL-3) levels were associated with increased

54

severity and mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infections. IL-3 promoted the recruitment of

55

antiviral circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) into the airways by stimulating

56

CXCL12 secretion from pulmonary CD123+ epithelial cells. This study identifies IL-3 as a

57

predictive disease marker and potential therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Main Text

78

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute infection of the respiratory tract

79

that had spread worldwide1. As patients may develop severe respiratory syndrome2, it is

80

important to define predictive markers allowing clinicians to identify patients at risk at an

81

early stage of the disease. IL-3 has been described as an important immune mediator during

82

infections3,4. We therefore investigated whether IL-3 might influence the outcome of SARS-

83

CoV-2 infection.

84

Patients with severe COVID-19, characterized by necessity for intensive care

85

treatment and high plasma CRP levels (Extended Data Fig. 1a), had reduced plasma IL-3

86

levels as compared to patients with non-severe COVID-19 or patients that had recovered (Fig.

87

1a). As well, patients with high viral load presented lower plasma IL-3 levels as compared to

88

patients with low viral load (Fig. 1b), both results suggesting an association between plasma

89

IL-3 levels and disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this prospective multicentric

90

observation study, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that plasma IL-3 levels may

91

predict the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections: using a minimal p-value approach, patients

92

with plasma IL-3 levels <20 pg/ml at admission had a poorer prognosis as compared to

93

patients with plasma IL-3 levels ≥20 pg/ml at admission (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Table 1),

94

this association remaining significant after adjusting for prognostic parameters in multivariate

95

analysis (Extended Data Table 2). Older age was described to be associated with greater risk

96

to develop severe COVID-195. Patients older than 65 years showed reduced plasma IL-3

97

levels as compared to patients younger than 65 years (Fig. 1d). Thus, the analysis of plasma

98

IL-3 levels and patient age allowed to identify three groups at risk to die from COVID-19:

99

patients <65 years with plasma IL-3 levels ≥20 or <20 pg/ml had a low to intermediate risk to

100

die whereas patients ≥65 years with plasma IL-3 levels <20 pg/ml had a high risk to die (95%-

101

CI: 1.680 – 118.218; OR: 14.091) (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 1b and Extended Data Table

102

103

over time as compared to non-survivors whereas no differences could be detected in the

104

numbers of circulating neutrophils (Fig. 1f). SARS-CoV-2+ patients exhibiting either high

105

plasma IL-3 levels or high circulating pDC numbers had therefore a better prognosis,

106

suggesting a putative link between IL-3 and pDCs during infection. Bronchoalveolar lavage

107

fluid (BALF) analysis (Extended Data Table 4) revealed that patients with high levels of IL-3

108

showed increased percentages of pDCs as compared to those with low levels (Fig. 1g).

109

We next investigated the link between IL-3 and the amount of pDCs in the airways

110

experimentally. Upon intranasal (i.n.) IL-3 administration, naive WT mice displayed higher

111

absolute numbers of pDCs, but not neutrophils, in the lung parenchyma as compared to

112

controls (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a) as well as substantially higher levels of IFNα and

113

IFNλ in the BALF after subsequent i.n. CpG injection (Fig. 2b). Depletion of pDCs induced a

114

strong reduction of IFNα levels in BALF of mice pre-treated with IL-3 upon i.n. CpG

115

administration, whereas IFNλ secretion was only partially impaired (Extended Data Fig. 2b-

116

c). Among the chemokines known to drive pDC migration into inflamed tissues6, only Cxcl12

117

expression was increased by IL-3 treatment in lungs of mice upon CpG administration (Fig.

118

2c and Extended Data Fig. 3a). We also detected increased CXCL12 levels in the BALF of

119

WT mice treated with IL-3 (Fig. 2d) and in the supernatant of ex vivo cultured lung cells

120

derived from naive WT mice upon IL-3 stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 3b). The induction of

121

CXCL12 was mediated through the IL-3 receptor common β-chain (CD131), as no increase in

122

CXCL12 levels was observed in the BALF of Cd131-/- mice upon IL-3 stimulation (Fig. 2d).

123

I.n. injection of CXCL12 in mice resulted in increased numbers of pDCs but not neutrophils

124

in the lungs (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Additionally, i.n. injection of CXCL12-neutralizing

125

antibodies prevented pDC influx into the lungs of WT mice upon IL-3 injection, whereas no

126

difference was observed for neutrophils (Fig. 2f). In SARS-CoV-2+ patients, plasma IL-3

127

levels strongly correlated with plasma CXCL12 levels, but not with plasma IL-6, TNF and

128

CRP levels (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 4a-c). CXCL12 plasma levels were also not

129

correlated with circulating pDC number (Extended Data Fig. 4d). In BALF of patients with

130

different respiratory diseases, IL-3 positively correlated with CXCL12 levels (Fig. 2h) and

131

high levels of CXCL12 were associated with increased percentages of pDCs (Fig. 2i).

132

We found that only CD45- non-haematopoietic cells expressed the α-chain of the IL-3

133

receptor (CD123) in the lungs of naive mice (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Likewise, only CD45-

134

cells secreted CXCL12 after IL-3 stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Flow cytometry

135

analyses revealed that only epithelial cells were found to overexpress CXCL12 in the lungs of

136

mice upon ex vivo IL-3 stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 5c). As well, CXCL12 was only

137

expressed by CD326+ CD123+ epithelial cells in human lungs (Fig 2j-k and Extended Data

138

Table 5).

139

Collectively, our study revealed that plasma IL-3 levels might allow risk stratification

140

in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections. We therefore propose IL-3 as a predictive marker

141

for disease severity and clinical outcome. Based on its ability to improve local antiviral

142

defence mechanisms by recruiting pDCs, recombinant IL-3, or CD123 receptor agonists, may

143

therefore have the potential as novel therapeutic agents in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

Materials & Methods

227

Animals: Balb/c (WT), C57Bl/6J (WT) (Janvier, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) and Cd131-/-

228

(C57Bl/6J background, bred in-house) mice were used in this study. Majority of the mice

229

were 8-12 weeks old when sacrificed. All animal protocols were approved by the animal

230

review committee from the university hospital Dresden and Erlangen and the local

231

governmental animal committee.

232
233

Mouse infection: Naive mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and infected intra-nasally

234

with 8µg of CpG (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA), 400ng of recombinant IL-3

235

(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), 500ng of recombinant CXCL12 (Peprotech, Rocky

236

Hill, NJ, USA), 50µg of IgG or anti-CXCL12 (R&D systems). For the pDCs depletion

237

experiment, 150µg of IgG or anti-CD317 (Miltenyi) were injected intravenously 15h hour

238

before IL-3 and CpG injection.

239
240

Murine leukocytes isolation: After lungs harvest, single cell suspensions were obtained as

241

follows: perfused lungs were cut in small pieces and subjected to enzymatic digestion with

242

450 U/ml collagenase I (Sigma Aldrich), 125 U/ml collagenese IX (Sigma Adrich), 60 U/ml

243

hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich), 60 U/ml Dnase (Sigma Aldrich) and 20 mM Hepes (Thermo

244

Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 1 hour at 37°C while shaking. Broncho-alveolar

245

lavage (BAL) was performed by flushing the lungs with 2 × 1 ml of PBS to retrieve the

246

infiltrated and resident leukocytes. Total viable cell numbers were obtained using Trypan Blue

247

(Carl Roth).

248

Quantitative RT-PCR: Real-time PCR was performed as previously described1. Briefly,

249

RNA was extracted from whole tissue by RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands).

250

Complementary DNA was reverse transcribed from 1 µg total RNA with Moloney murine

251

leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using random hexamer

252

oligonucleotides for priming (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The amplification was performed

253

with a Biorad CFX-Connect Real-time-System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the SYBR

254

Green (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) or TaqMan (Thermo Fisher Scientific) detection

255

system. Data were analyzed using the software supplied with the Sequence Detector (Life

256

Technologies). The mRNA content for Cxcl12, Ccl2, Cxcl9 and Ccl21 was normalized to the

257

hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt) mRNA for mouse genes. Gene

258

expression was quantified using the ∆∆Ct method. The expression level was arbitrarily set to

259

1 for one sample from the PBS group, and the values for the other samples were calculated

260

relatively to this reference. The sequence of primers is in Extended Data Table 3.

261
262

Cytokine detection: Mouse: Secreted CXCL12 (R&D systems), IFNλ (R&D systems) and

263

IFNα (R&D systems) were measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

264

Human: Secreted CXCL12 (R&D Systems), IL-3 (R&D Systems), IL-6 (Biolegend) and TNF

265

(Biolegend) were measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

266
267

Lung cells stimulation in vitro: Lung cell suspensions from naive mice were cultured in

268

RPMI-1640 GlutaMax supplemented with 10% FCS, 25mM of Hepes, 1 mM sodium

269

pyruvate, 100U/ml of Penicillin-Streptomycin and 20µg/ml of Gentamicin at 37°C in the

270

presence of 5% CO2. Lung cell suspensions were stimulated in 12-well plates (106 cells/ml)

271

during 24h by IL-3 (20ng/ml). Then supernatants were collected for cytokine measurement.

(Miltenyi Biotec), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

274
275

Immunohistochemistry: For CXCL12 and EpCAM permanent immunohistochemistry, the

276

staining was performed as previously described2. The characteristics of the respective patients

277

are detailed in Extended Data Table 2. In brief, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung

278

tissues were deparaffinized by xylene two times for 15 min. The tissue was rehydrated using

279

decreasing concentrations of ethanol (100%, 96%, 85% and 70%) for 2 min each. Antigen

280

retrieval was performed using Target Retrieval Solution (DakoCytomation) at pH 9.0 at 95°C

281

for 20 min followed by cooling for 20 min at RT. As a washing buffer between the incubation

282

steps, 1xTBS pH 7.6 was used. The slides were blocked by hydrogen peroxide (7.5%, Sigma-

283

Aldrich), avidin-biotin-block (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and 10% donkey

284

normal serum (DNS, Vector Laboratories) in TBS for 10 min. The primary antibodies diluted

285

in 2.5% DNS (rabbit anti-human EpCAM cat no. ab71916, Abcam, 1:300; mouse anti-human

286

CXCL12 cat. no. MAB350, R&D Systems, 1:150) and isotype control antibodies in

corresponding concentrations were detected using either the RTU Vectastain Elite ABC Kit

288

anti-mouse/rabbit (for EpCAM and CXCL12; Vector Laboratories) and NovaRed substrate

289

(Vector Laboratories) as a substrate. The slides were counterstained with Gill-III hematoxylin

312

Human specimen: This prospective, multicentric, observational clinical study was first

313

approved by the local ethics committee on February, 1st 2016 (UKER 10_16 B), and modified

314

on April, 28th 2020 (UKER 174_20 B). Departments from 3 additional University Hospitals in

315

Germany participated in this study. Prospective measurements of Interleukin-3 and analysis of

316

patients participating in the trial have been conducted between April 1st 2020 and June 4th

317

2020. The observational clinical studies were conducted in the medical wards and intensive

318

care units of the (i) University Hospital of Erlangen, Germany; (ii) University Hospital of

319

Essen, Germany; (iii) University Hospital of Giessen, Germany; and (iv) University Hospital

320

of Bonn, Germany. Study patients or their legal designees signed written informed consent. In

from oral swabs, oral fluid, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were enrolled in this trial. Blood

323

samples were collected at the onset of symptoms (≤ 24 hours), and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 days

324

later; or after recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with high viral load are patients

325

with CT levels above the median of all patients (Median CT levels: 32.63). 20 healthy donors

326

served as controls. Blood: After blood collection, plasma of all study participants was

327

immediately obtained by centrifugation, transferred into cryotubes, and stored at -80°C until

328

further processing. For flow cytometry analysis, red blood cells were removed by centrifuging

329

blood cells 7 min at 400g without break in Leukosep tube (Greiner, Kremsmünster, Austria).

330

Leukocytes were then stained 20 min at 4°C in dark and fixed 1 hour with BD Cytofix buffer

331

(BD Biosciences). Bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid specimen (13 patients): After written

332

informed consent and in agreement with the local ethics review board of the University of

333

Erlangen (UKER no. 4147) the segmental bronchi of patients scheduled for fiber-optic

334

bronchoscopy due to various inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions were flushed

335

with 100ml sterile 0.9% saline fluid. Fluid has been obtained and processed for flow

336

cytometric analysis of leukocyte surface markers. In addition, after centrifugation the

337

supernatants have been stored at -80°C until further processing. Patients with low IL-3 or low

338

CXCL12 are patients with a level of IL-3 or CXCL12 under the mean of all the patients.

339

Patients with high IL-3 or high CXCL12 are patients with a level of IL-3 or CXCL12 above

340

the mean of all the patients. Lung tissue specimen (15 patients): The study was performed at

341

the University of Erlangen in Germany. Patients were selected within the framework of the

342

thoracic surgery board. The patients who underwent surgery and gave their approval were

343

included in this study. The study was performed in agreement with the local ethics review

344

board of the University of Erlangen (UKER 10_16 B, UKER 339_15 Bc; UKER 56_12B;

345

DRKS-ID: DRKS00005376). Patients' confidentiality was maintained. The surgery consisted

346

of a wedge resection of the lung or lobectomy. Subsequently, tissue samples were taken from

347

the surgically removed material and transported into the laboratory under standardized

conditions (at 4°C, in Ringer's solution) for further preparation and analysis. Samples were

349

taken from the non-pathological area from the lung for further analysis. For flow cytometry

350

analysis, separate lung tissue sections were cut into small pieces and subjected to enzymatic

351

digestion with 450 U/ml collagenase I, 125 U/ml collagenase XI, 60 U/ml DNase I and 60

352

U/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 1 h at 37°C while shaking at 750 rpm

353

after which they have been homogenized through a 40µm nylon mesh for flow cytometric

354

analysis. Total viable cell numbers were obtained using Trypan Blue (Cellgro, Mediatech, Inc,

355

VA).

356
357

Statistics: Results were expressed as mean ± S.E.M. and expressed as identified in legends.

358

For comparing 2 groups, statistical tests included unpaired, 2-tailed parametric t tests with

359

Welch’s correction (when Gaussian distribution was assumed), unpaired, 2-tailed

360

nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests (when Gaussian distribution was not assumed) or paired,

361

2-tailed parametric t tests. P values of 0.05 or less were considered to denote significance.
