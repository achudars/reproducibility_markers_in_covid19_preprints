The a priori T cell repertoire and immune response against SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens may explain the

43

varying clinical course and prognosis of patients having a mild COVID-19 infection as opposed to those

44

developing more fulminant multisystem organ failure and associated mortality. Using a novel SARS-

45

Cov-2-specific artificial antigen presenting cell (aAPC), coupled with a rapid expansion protocol (REP)

46

as practiced in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) therapy, we generate an immune catalytic quantity

47

of Virus Induced Lymphocytes (VIL). Using T cell receptor (TCR)-specific aAPCs carrying co-stimulatory

48

molecules and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I immunodominant SARS-CoV-2

49

peptide-pentamer complexes, we expand virus-specific VIL derived from peripheral blood

50

mononuclear cells (PBMC) of convalescent COVID-19 patients up to 1,000-fold. This is achieved in a

51

clinically relevant 7-day vein-to-vein time-course as a potential adoptive cell therapy (ACT) for COVID-

52

19. We also evaluate this approach for other viral pathogens using Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific

53

VIL from donors as a control. Rapidly expanded VIL are enriched in virus antigen-specificity and show

54

an activated, polyfunctional cytokine profile and T effector memory phenotype which may contribute

55

to a robust immune response. Virus-specific T cells can also be delivered allogeneically via MHC-typing

56

and patient human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matching to provide pragmatic treatment in a large-scale

57

therapeutic setting. These data suggest that VIL may represent a novel therapeutic option that

58

warrants further clinical investigation in the armamentarium against COVID-19 and other possible

59

future pandemics.

MAIN

70

Adoptive Cell Therapies (ACT) utilizing autologous patient-derived Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes

71

(TIL) have demonstrated reproducible clinical responses in the setting of highly immunogenic tumors

72

such as melanoma and HPV derived cervical cancer. With neoantigen enrichment, this demonstrable

73

clinical efficacy has been extended to common epithelial solid tumors1, 2. The efficacy of TIL cell

74

therapy relies on antigen specificity to the cognate cancer neoantigen, and on the ability to expand a

75

large quantity of autologous or allogeneic cancer antigen-specific T cells ex vivo, and deliver this

76

number back to the patient to enable cytolysis of the tumor cells and eradication of the cancer3, 4.

77

Likewise, antigen-specific T cells are critical for an effective cellular immune response during infection

78

with viral pathogens, and activation of cytotoxic T cells can clear an infection by killing virus-infected

79

cells5, 6, 7, 8. Thus, we propose a similar-in-principle novel antigen-specific adoptive T cell therapy for

80

viral infection predicated on precise T cell viral antigen-specificity. However, this viral platform

81

requires cell kinetic expansion in days not weeks, thus allowing for the adoptive transfer of

82

immunologically competent T cells in a therapeutically relevant time course in the setting of acute

83

viral infection.

84

Like their tumor-resident counterparts, TIL, Virally-Induced Lymphocytes, or VIL, represent

85

those T cells that have been activated in response to TCR-mediated, antigen-specific recognition of

86

protein epitopes from viral particles9, 10. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in mediating viral

87

clearance in response to many respiratory viral infections including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),

88

influenza and coronavirus (CoV)5. Recent evidence has also demonstrated a critical role for the T cell

89

immune response in the pathogenesis of the recently emerged COVID-19 disease, caused by the novel

90

SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus11, 12, 13, 14. In addition to the readily detectible humoral immune response in

91

the context of neutralizing antibodies in convalescent patients who had recovered from COVID-19,

92

these studies have collectively shown strong SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells are frequently

93

observed11, 13. Furthermore, significantly larger T cell responses appear to correlate with severity of

94

the disease, underscoring the importance of T cells above and beyond the humoral antibody response

95

for combating infection11. This is an important consideration for a novel therapeutic, as most

96

prophylactic vaccines currently in development for COVID-19 are designed to focus on eliciting

97

antibody responses to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-215, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.

98

In addition, the antibody response in recovered COVID-19 patients has been shown to decline

99

several months after infection, raising concerns that therapeutics or vaccines designed to elicit

100

primarily neutralizing antibody responses may not be sufficient to engender the cellular immunity

101

required for long-term duration of protection or to protect from potential repeat infections25. Thus,

102

the a priori T cell repertoire, both quantity and quality, may portend COVID-19 disease prognosis and

103

may influence the outcome between mild or severe disease. The treatment of patients with

104

convalescent sera has recently been given US FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) 26. The transfer

105

of neutralizing antibodies reflects a more passive serological immune engagement versus the more

106

active cellular immune response that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells would provide.

107

In an evolution of the cGMP methods for the expansion of TIL for the treatment of cancer that

108

the researchers employ in a currently active human clinical trial27, we sought to develop an adoptive

109

T cell therapy for COVID-19 based on rapid ex vivo expansion of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific VIL. Given

110

the crucial importance of a strong virus-specific T cell response for patients with severe disease,

111

especially during the critical days where respiratory distress is common, the adoptive transfer of a

112

quantity of expanded, activated, effector memory T cells capable of mounting a robust virus-specific

113

response may be important to reduce viral load and improve patient outcomes. Thus, we designed a

114

T cell expansion platform comprising of microbead-based artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs),

115

we termed VIPR-particles (VIL-inducing particles Rx), that carry MHC pentamer-peptide or tetramer-

116

peptide complexes, specific for immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, coupled with costimulatory

117

anti-CD28 antibodies.

118

Using Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from convalescing COVID-19

119

patients to represent what may be achievable in the clinic for patients actively suffering from the

120

severe disease, we show that these TCR-specific aAPCs can expand virus-specific VIL up to 1,000-fold

121

over a rapid and minimal culturing duration of just 7-days. Furthermore, these expanded VIL are

122

enriched in virus antigen-specificity, show polyfunctional cytokine responses and acquire a T effector

123

memory phenotype, making them highly suited for participating in an active cellular immune response

124

when adoptively transferred back to patients after this minimal ex vivo expansion time. We also

125

demonstrate the broad clinical potential of this platform and its modularity beyond COVID-19 and

126

show in the setting of CMV infection that VIL specific for immunodominant CMV epitopes can also be

127

expanded up to 1,000-fold using CMV-specific VIPR particles over a 7-day culture.

128

There are unfortunately limited therapeutic options for the treatment of COVID-19 that have

129

demonstrated robust clinical relevance amidst the ongoing pandemic.

130

contemporaneous actual experience in the critical care of COVID-19 patients dating from the first

131

quarter of 2020 in New York City, NY, USA, including observations of the clinical time course, hallmark

132

clinical features, and treatment from presentation through critical illness to ultimate resolution or

133

mortality, provides guidance as to the need for a vein-to-vein time of 7-days in order to intercede

134

timely. A protective virus-specific T cell therapy may be an important novel modality for the treatment

135

of SARS-CoV-2 and other pandemic viral pathogens.

RESULTS

138
139

The detection and enrichment of antigen-specific Virus Induced Lymphocytes (VIL) in CMV

140

infected individuals

141
142

To develop a platform for robust and rapid ex vivo expansion of viral antigen-specific T cells from

143

patients exposed to viral pathogens, we generated a micro-aAPC capable of providing an

144

immunogenic viral peptide in the context of MHC Class I or MHC Class II molecules in combination

145

with anti-CD28 stimulation molecules (Fig. 1a). MHC-I pentamers or MHC-II tetramers with associated

146

viral antigen peptide complexes, along with anti-CD28 antibodies, were conjugated to 2.8 µm

147

superparamagnetic beads with a monolayer of streptavidin covalently coupled to the surface. We

148

termed these microbead-based aAPCs VIPR particles, and selected immunodominant viral antigens of

149

known MHC specificity to demonstrate their capacity for TCR stimulation and simultaneous expansion

150

of responding T cells. T cells isolated from donor PBMCs were cultured with these VIPR particles for 7-

151

days in the presence of high concentrations of trophic cytokines, IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15 and addition of

152

N-acetylcysteine (NAC), known to improve T cell proliferation28. As a validated control to demonstrate

153

efficacy of the platform, we selected an immunodominant MHC-I restricted pp65 antigen of

154

cytomegalovirus (CMV) known to robustly stimulate the TCRs of CMV-specific T cells29.

155

Individuals that have been previously exposed to CMV infection have recirculating virus-

156

specific T cells (VIL) in their blood with TCRs specific for a variety of antigenic CMV peptides30. Using

157

fluorescently conjugated pentamers and flow cytometry we analyzed the CD3+ T cells isolated from

158

the PBMCs of several independent CMV positive individuals and found approximately 0.2% of T cells

159

were CD8+ cells demonstrating specificity for the CMV pp65 antigen (Fig. 1b). After a 7-day culture

160

with VIPR particles, these cells enriched on average 20-fold, reaching Pentamer+/CD8+ T cell

161

proportions of over 4% (Fig. 1b&c). By comparison, donor T cells cultured in cytokine alone in the

162

absence of VIPR particles showed a minimal enrichment in antigen-specific VIL proportions, even

163

though the T cells proliferated robustly. In addition to the enrichment of virus-specific CD8+ T cells

164

using MHC-I restricted antigens, CD4+ T cells could also be enriched over 20-fold using MHC-II VIPR

165

particles carrying a well validated CMV glycoprotein antigen (Fig. 1b).

171

Optimization of antigen-specific micro aAPCs for T cell expansion

172
173

Next we sought to optimize the design of the VIPR particle aAPCs to further enhance the expansion of

174

antigen-specific T cells within the rapid 7-day stimulation culture. To this end, we first investigated

175

the impact that the ratio of T cells to VIPR particles had on the proportion of CMV-specific T cells

176

enriched at day-7. A dose-dependent enrichment was seen with lower doses of particles and higher

177

numbers of T cells, such that an optimal enrichment was observed with a ratio of 20:1 T cells to VIPR

178

particles (Fig. 1d). In addition, we observed that increasing the ratio of molecules of anti-CD28

179

antibody to peptide-MHC-pentamer also increased the capacity of the VIPR particles for expansion of

180

the antigen-specific VIL population (Fig. 1e)

181
182

The detection and enrichment of SARS-CoV-2-specific T Cells in COVID-19 convalescent

183

individuals

184
185

We next evaluated whether VIPR particles can be used to enrich and expand SARS-CoV-2 specific T

186

cells from COVID-19 patients. To investigate this, we obtained PBMCs from COVID-19 convalescent

187

individuals 24 days or more after developing symptoms and testing positive by PCR, and analyzed the

188

frequency and proportion of VIL specific for a recently published and validated immunodominant

189

MHC-I SARS-CoV-2 epitope YLQPRTFLL (YLQ)31. Surprisingly, we found YLQ antigen-specific VIL were

190

barely detectible within the isolated T cell populations from these individuals (Fig. 2a&b).

191

However, after 7-day culture with MHC-I VIPR particles, antigen-specific CD8+ T cells could be

192

readily detected by pentamer staining and could be enriched and expanded to frequencies greater

193

than 1% (Fig 2a&b). While the majority of PBMCs from convalescent individuals with the YLQ matched

194

MHC allele (HLA A*02), included T cells from which antigen specific VIL could be enriched, the overall

195

frequency varied between individuals and did not appear to correlate with either the length of time

196

since they were symptomatic, nor the reported severity of their symptoms (Fig. 2b)

197
198

Rapid VIL expansion results in 1,000-fold enrichment of CMV antigen-specific T cells within 7-

199

days

200
201

Having demonstrated that VIPR particles can enrich both SARS-CoV-2 and CMV specific T cells, we

202

evaluated the capacity for the 7-day culture system to expand the overall quantity of virus specific VIL.

203

The T cell cultures were configured to include the same culturing conditions used in neoantigen TIL

204

human clinical trials to enable rapid T cell expansion, thus in addition to the VIPR particles and high IL-

205

2 (6000 IU/ml), IL-7, IL-15 and NAC, T cells were cultured in Gas Permeable Rapid Expansion (G-REX)

206

plates. These culture plates enable gas exchange from the base of the culture well, allowing cells to

207

be cultured with a large ratio of media per surface area and abundant access to nutrients, and have

208

been shown to facilitate a large and rapid expansion of primary human T cells32.

209

After 7-days of culture with VIPR particles, SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific CD8+ T cells could be

210

robustly expanded in proportion, but most importantly in absolute quantity of T cells, to an average

211

of over 1,000-fold (Fig. 2c). Thus, we found that cultures seeded with 1x106 total CD3+ T cells could

212

reach expanded numbers, on average, between 2.6x107 and 4.5x107 total cells at day-7. This

213

proliferative expansion coupled with the enrichment of the VIL population resulted in an average of

214

2.4x105 SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cells per million CD3+ cultured (Fig. 2c). A similar robustness in the

215

expansion in absolute number of virus-specific CD8+ VIL could also be observed with T cells from CMV-

216

positive individuals when stimulated with MHC-I VIPR particles under these culture conditions (Fig.

217

2d). After 7-days, antigen-specific CD8+ T cells had increased from approximately 2x103 cells to over

218

1.0x106, leading to up to an average >700-fold expansion in cell number.

219

Collectively these data demonstrate the ability of the VIPR particle expansion protocol to

220

rapidly enrich and expand VIL from low numbers in CMV-positive individuals and near undetectable

221

numbers in COVID-19 convalescent individuals, to significantly large numbers of virus-specific T cells.

222
223

The activation and T cell memory phenotype of rapidly-expanded CMV and SARS-CoV-2

224

antigen-specific VIL

225
226

To evaluate the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells and CMV specific T cells that had undergone

227

enrichment and expansion with VIPR particles, T cells were analyzed for expression of cell surface

228

markers indictive of T cell activation. We observed SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells expressing co-

229

stimulatory and activation markers 4-1BB, OX-40 and CD25, albeit variable between convalescent

230

individuals, and an elevated expression of HLA-DR when compared to non-virus-specific T cells within

231

the culture (Fig. 3a). The SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific VIL population also showed a significant

232

expression of the checkpoint markers PD-1, TIGIT, LAG-3, indicating these T cells have acquired a

233

proliferative and activated functional phenotype (Fig. 3b). The same profile of activation marker and

234

checkpoint gene expression was observed when CMV-specific VIL were stimulated after 7-day rapid

235

expansion with VIPR particles, with a similarly observed variability between different CMV-positive

236

individuals, indicating this culture platform is effective at rapid T cells expansion and activation with

237

multiple viral antigens (Fig. 3c&d).

238

We analyzed the memory phenotype of the expanded SARS-CoV-2 and CMV virus-specific T

239

cells by measuring expression of the canonical memory markers CD45RA and CD45RO and categorized

240

the cell populations into either a naïve (CD45RO-, CD45RA+) or memory phenotype (CD45RO+, CD45RA-

241

). After the 7-day culture in IL-2, IL-7, IL-15 and NAC, the majority of CMV T cells had begun to adopt

242

a memory phenotype, but the virus-specific CD8+ T cells were almost exclusively expressing the

243

highest levels of CD45RO and completely lost CD45RA expression, indicating the antigen-specific

244

population had uniformly transitioned into memory T cells (Fig. 4a). Further delineation of the T cell

245

memory phenotype by analysis of CD62L expression within the CD45RO+ population revealed the

246

virus-specific T cells had robustly differentiated into an effector memory T cell phenotype via

247

downregulation of CD62L (Fig. 4a&b). The non-virus-specific T cells within these cultures however,

248

consisted of significantly more naïve T cells. The same profile of effector memory T cells was observed

249

when SARS-CoV-2-specific VIL were stimulated after 7-day rapid expansion with VIPR particles, again

250

demonstrating the antigen-specific VIPR particle platform is effective at significantly expanding

251

activated effector memory T cells over a short time-course. (Fig. 4c&d).

252
253

Polyfunctional proinflammatory cytokine expression among rapidly-expanded CMV and SARS-

254

CoV-2 antigen-specific VIL

255
256

To further evaluate the function of the rapidly expanded virus-specific VIL, we performed intracellular

257

cytokine staining and flow cytometry and measured the proportion of the cells that were producing

258

IFN, TNF and IL-2. VIPR particle expanded T cells from convalescent COVID-19 individuals were

259

stimulated after 7-day culture with 20𝜇g/ml of SARS-CoV-2 YLQPRTFLL peptide antigen for 6-hours.

260

We observed strong expression of all three proinflammatory cytokines within the antigen-specific T

261

cell population (identified by TCR specific pentamer staining), but could not detect expression of either

262

IFN or TNF in the non-antigen-specific T cell population (T cells that do not bind the TCR-specific

263

pentamer) nor within the T cells cultured for 7-days without any VIPR particle expansion (Fig. 5a&b).

264

The antigen-specific T cells also showed significantly elevated levels of IL-2 when compared to the

265

non-antigen specific CD8+ population. When analyzed together we see an elevated proportion of cells

266

expressing 1, 2 or all 3 cytokines in combination when compared to the non-SARS-CoV-2-specific T

267

cells within the expanded culture (Fig. 5c&d).

268

The same functional response was observed with virus-specific VIL expanded in T cells isolated

269

from CMV-positive individuals and stimulated for 6-hours with pp65 MHC-I epitope peptide antigen.

270

Intracellular cytokine staining revealed a robust increase in production of all cytokines in the CMV-

271

specific CD8+ T cells when compared to the non-specific T cells from the same cultures or non-

272

stimulated controls (Fig. 5e&f). An elevated frequency of polyfunctional CD8+ T cells expressing

273

multiple proinflammatory cytokines was also seen in the CMV-specific T cell population (fig. 5g&h).

274

Taken together, these analyses demonstrate that elevated numbers of virus-specific VIL can

275

be rapidly expanded in 7-days by VIPR particle culture and form robust activated, polyfunctional

276

effector memory T cells.

DISCUSSION

279
280

Given the paucity of therapeutic options for the treatment of COVID-19 and the provocative data

281

suggesting the importance of the immune T cell response to viral infections, we investigate a novel

282

potential therapeutic modality to augment the anti-viral T cell response by providing a therapeutic

283

immune boost of virus-specific T cells (VIL). Similar to adoptive cell therapy (ACT) methods in immuno-

284

oncology to actively transfer Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL), here we demonstrate the potential

285

utility of Virus Induced Lymphocytes (VIL) to deliver SARS-CoV-2 immunodominant viral antigens in

286

the setting of nascent and acute COVID-19 infection. Unlike T cell immuno-oncology in which T cell

287

expansion and subsequent efficacy requires substantial critical mass of quantity, and thus time, VIL

288

serve a catalytic immune booster function and can be isolated and expanded ex vivo both autologously

289

and also MHC typed for allogenic delivery in a 7-day vein-to-vein time which is clinically practical and

290

relevant (as depicted in fig. 6a).

291

In the setting of COVID-19 pathogenesis, studies have found individuals suffering from a more

292

severe presentation of the disease typically require a duration of hospitalization ranging from 5 to 29

293

days33, 34. Thus, a therapeutic treatment to improve patient outcome must be rapidly administered

294

during the critical time window of disease progression prior to and/or early in the patient’s intubation

295

and ventilatory support. Herein lies the opportunity for a T cell therapy that can robustly expand the

296

quantity and quality of virus-reactive T cells within this short duration to help boost the immune

297

response and potentiate the patient’s own in vivo T cell response to the viral infection. Developments

298

in Rapid Expansion Protocols (REP) for T cell and TIL expansion in the setting of clinical oncology have

299

enabled methods for the robust and exponential ex vivo expansion of unenriched, as well as

300

neoantigen-enriched, T cells for the autologous treatment of solid tumors35, 36, 37, 38. In fact, large

301

quantities of antigen-specific TIL can be expanded in just 22 days using well established protocols39.

302

This duration is however too long for a clinically relevant cell therapy in the setting of COVID-19 and

303

thus in this study we have developed a more rapid T cell expansion protocol that builds upon the

305

Our approach enables an over 1,000-fold expansion in the numbers of viral antigen-specific

306

T cells in just 7-days from isolation of a patient’s T cells, providing a higher quantity of activated,

307

polyfunctional effector memory cells. This study demonstrates the antigen-specific expansion of

308

SARS-CoV-2 T cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients to demonstrate applicability for this viral

309

pathogen, yet one important consideration is that these individuals have very low numbers of

310

recirculating SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells in their blood due to the timeframe since their infection and

311

recovery (fig. 2b). Hospitalized, symptomatic COVID-19 patients with a severe form of the disease will

312

be undergoing a significant cellular immune response whereby the numbers of virus-specific T cells

313

may have expanded, even if overall T cell numbers may be reduced in some individuals40. While this

314

T cell response needs therapeutically boosting to potentiate viral clearance and ensure positive

315

disease outcome, we expect a more robust and significantly elevated VIL expansion can be achieved

316

when T cells are acquired from suffering COVID-19 patients as opposed to recovered convalescent

317

individuals. When considering the translation of this platform into the clinic as a potential cell therapy

318

for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, based on the level of enrichment and expansion demonstrated in

319

this study, and a prediction of the number of SARS-COV-2 cells in the blood of COVID-19 individuals,

320

we calculate an estimated capability to expand and deliver an average of approximately 3.5x109 SARS-

321

CoV-2 CD8+ and/or CD4+ T cells back to the patient within 7-days (Fig. 6b).

322

The key features of this VIL expansion platform include the use of high concentration of IL-2

323

to enable robust T cell proliferation supported by IL-7 and IL-15, and the addition of N-acetyl cysteine

324

(NAC) which has been shown to significantly reduce upregulation of the DNA damage marker γH2AX,

325

and the subsequent cell death seen in T cell culturing 41. The expansion of VIL in G-REX plates and

326

flasks also improves overall T cell proliferation by supporting more effective gaseous exchange and

327

nutrient availability, further adding to the rapidity by which significant numbers of virus-specific VIL

328

can be generated (Fig. 2c&d). A major component and innovation of the platform are the VIPR

329

Particles themselves, which provide a viral epitope peptide in the context of MHC class I pentamers,

330

or class II tetramers, to bind and stimulate the cognate TCRs specific for this antigen (fig. 1a). These

331

aAPCs mimic the physiological presentation of viral antigens to CD8+ T cells by dendritic cells that

332

occurs in local draining lymph nodes during viral infection, and the coating of the particles with anti-

333

CD28 antibodies provides the necessary co-stimulatory signals that are critically required for effective

334

T cell activation and formation of effector memory T cells42. It is well established that costimulatory

335

signals like those delivered by CD28 (signal two) dictate whether CD8+ T cells will become optimally

336

activated and expand, or whether the activation will be suboptimal42. While studies have also shown

337

that T cells can indeed be expanded, from memory, and protect form viral infections in animal models

338

in the absence of co-stimulation43, 44, it was found that very high levels of TCR stimulation were needed

339

to overcome the need for co-stimulation45, 46. Thus, if a strong, shared, immunodominant and well

340

validated peptide antigen is known and available for a viral pathogen, large numbers of VIL could

341

potentially be expanded ex vivo by soluble peptide in the absence of an aAPC or co-stimulation.

342

However, this situation is clinically irrelevant for most pathogens whereby multiple immunogenic

343

epitopes typically exist and the comparative affinity for their cognate TCRs may not be known (as in

344

an emerging pandemic). This is true in the case for the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus which has

345

been shown to harbor dozens of immunogenic shared epitopes spread throughout the genome, 90%

346

of which are not located in the spike protein and show almost no cross-reactivity with known epitopes

347

in seasonal coronaviruses, and for which T cell immunity must be established empirically12, 31.

348

Furthermore, a hospitalized COVID-19 patient’s own TCR repertoire for SARS-CoV-2 cannot be

349

quickly assessed and determined to ensure they can respond to the strongest of these peptide

350

epitopes in the absence of co-stimulation. Thus, VIL expansion platforms for newly emerged

351

pathogens, as well as seasonal variants of existing viruses, will benefit from aAPC-mediated

352

approaches, where the presence of CD28 co-stimulation should lower the T cell activation threshold

353

and provide robust co-stimulation to ensure strong proliferation and effector memory T cell

354

formation.

355

An alternative approach for VIL expansion by viral antigen presentation to T cells in the

356

context of this co-stimulation, is the use of autologous professional antigen presentation cells (APCs)

357

such as dendritic cells harvested from the patient’s blood, pulsed with antigenic peptide and co-

358

cultured with the T cells. While in theory this works well for antigen-specific activation and expansion

359

of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and is routinely used in the setting of neoantigen-specific TIL expansion38, this

360

is impractical in the setting of rapid VIL expansion as a therapeutic for hospitalized patients suffering

361

from acute viral infections such as with SARS-CoV-2. Dendritic cells are typically generated from

362

autologous monocytes through a series of ex vivo maturation steps with different cytokines which

363

includes approximately 6 days of culture in IL-4 and GM-CSF to generate immature DCs before further

364

maturation47. This requirement for several days of manipulation before the dendritic cells can be used

365

to activate and expand the patient’s VIL, precludes their use for rapid T cell expansion in the setting

366

of acute and severe viral infections such as with COVID-19. Therefore, we believe the VIPR platform

367

based on artificial APCs offers a clinically meaningful and practical alternative to this approach.

368

Given the importance of the aAPC VIPR particles for T cell stimulation, we optimized the

369

design to maximize the strength of the TCR and CD28 engagement by determining both the effective

370

dose ratio of particles per T cell (1:20) and the optimal density of peptide-MHC-pentamer versus anti-

371

CD28 antibody (1:30) on the surface of the particle (fig. 1d&e). When the optimized VIPR particles

372

were combined with other elements of the protocol, including high cytokine concentrations and G-

373

REX flasks, we thus observed not only a significant expansion in virus-specific VIL cell numbers (Fig.

374

2c&d), but that these cells had developed into activated effector memory T cells (Figs. 3&4). This was

375

crucial to establish a pool of virus-reactive T cells that can not only mount a primary immune response

376

against the virus when adoptively transferred to the patient, but also engender immunological

377

memory to ensure the duration of the response is long lasting. Given the active state of the VIL by

378

day-7, it is likely that further cellular expansion will be catalyzed upon ACT to the patient given the

379

characteristic upregulated endogenous inflammasome of COVID-19 patients. Importantly, after a 7-

380

day expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 VIL, the cells were producing robust levels of polyfunctional cytokine

381

(Fig. 5). Thus, the expanding virus-specific VIL that can subsequently be transferred back to the patient

382

are primed to mount a functional cellular response in the context of cytokine release and recruitment

383

of other immune cells. These antigen-specific CD8+ T cells are also likely primed to recognize and

384

mount a cytolytic response against infected cells, aiding to clear the viral infection.

385

The VIPR rapid expansion platform is modular and tunable to multiple viral antigens restricted

386

to different MHC alleles. Using validated CMV epitopes, we generated MHC class II VIPR particles

387

against the DRB1*07:01 restricted gB 215-229 antigen and were able to enrich and expand CD4+ T

388

cells (Fig. 1b). Thus, this technology can be used to expand both T Helper and Cytolytic virus-specific

389

VIL to provide a modality to tune a specific cell therapy product to treat different viral diseases. The

390

enrichment and expansion of CMV-specific T cells demonstrates the flexibility of the VIPR particle

391

system for addressing cell therapies for diverse pathogens where immunogenic epitopes are known.

392

VIPR particles are off-the-shelf reagents that can be rapidly utilized for ex vivo T cell expansion in the

393

clinic without any additional manufacturing lead time. We expect that this technology would provide

394

a modality for expansion of all clinically relevant virally-mediated diseases where an immune boosting

395

dose of virus-specific T cells would aid in viral clearance and disease outcome. Furthermore, due to

396

the immune catalytic nature of T cells and their ability to expand further in vivo and recruit additional

397

cells of the immune system, we believe that an efficacious therapeutic dose of virus-specific T is likely

398

to be well within the numbers achievable within short durations of expansion. In instances whereby

399

such a short duration of T cell expansion is not as critical as required in diseases like COVID-19, this

400

technology can also enable the expansion and cryopreservation of virus-specific VIL.

401

To be broadly applicable as a pragmatic modality that is scalable, we have MHC typed donor

402

pools of SARS-CoV-2-specific VIL for use as an allogeneic off-the-shelf therapy at scale. In this setting,

403

these T cells are tissue matched to COVID-19 patients and provided as an allogeneic cell therapy

404

product to combat an active infection. Thus, by virtue of having pre-expanded stocks of SARS-COV-2

405

cells from SARS-CoV-2 donors, hospitalized patients can be treated immediately with the cells within

406

the ICU upon MHC tissue type results. Furthermore, cryopreservation of other VIL, such as MHC -

407

typed CMV-specific VIL, could, as an example, be used to immunize bone marrow transplant recipients

408

or other immunocompromised individuals against adventitious pathogens48.

409

In summary we demonstrate a novel technology platform for the robust and rapid expansion

410

of virus-specific T cells as a potential cell therapy for COVID-19 and other viral pathogens. Heretofore,

411

the promising antigen-specific therapeutic approaches to date, including polyclonal antibody cocktails

412

and monoclonal antibodies, and current prophylactic vaccine approaches to COVID-19, all have been

413

focused on neutralizing antibodies. However, complete immune protection is likely also a function of

414

the long-lasting central memory T cell response to provide both cellular immunity, and potentiate

415

humoral immunity, and thus prolong the duration of protection8, 11.

416

As development and validation of the VIL platform continues, a global “second-wave” of

417

COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, perhaps exacerbated by seasonal inflection, appears to be

418

accelerating49. Validated therapies are few and largely supportive or non-specific, such as the use of

419

dexamethasone to delay mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 induced pulmonary failure.

420

morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 critical illness remain alarmingly high50. Thus, there is an urgent

421

need for specificity and efficacy in the clinic to mitigate disease progression and severity. Using the

422

same cGMP validation processes employed in the setting of a CRISPR-engineered TIL cell therapy for

423

cancer, we will explore a timely regulatory path to evaluating the VIL platform technology in a phase

424

I/II clinical trial of SARS-CoV-2 -infected patients, should there continue to be an urgent need during

425

the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Patient samples and preparation of T cells

430

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from anonymized CMV-positive individuals and

431

convalescent COVID-19 individuals (Caltag Medsystems, Tissue Solutions Ltd, Precision for Medicine,

432

Inc.) and obtained, handled and stored in accordance with the Human Tissue Authority UK regulations.

433

Genomic DNA was extracted from PBMC samples using the Gentra Puregene DNA isolation kit

434

(Qiagen) and DNA samples were HLA-typed by sequencing at Class I (HLA-A, -B & -C) and Class II (HLA-

435

DRB1) loci (MC Diagnostics). Total CD3+ T cells were isolated from unfractionated PBMCs using the

436

EasySep™ Human T Cell Isolation Kit (Stem Cell Technologies) with a DynaMag™-2 magnet

437

(ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Purity and viability of isolated T

438

cells was assessed using flow cytometry prior to cryopreservation of isolated T cells in CryoStore CS10

441

Preparation of VIPR Particles

442

Micro-aAPC VIPR particles were constructed by direct conjugation of biotin labelled peptide-MHC-

443

Pentamers and biotinylated MHC class II Tetramers to streptavidin Dynabeads in combination with

444

biotinylated anti-CD28 antibodies. Pro5 MHC Class I Pentamers were provided by ProImmune Ltd and

445

include the following peptide epitopes: CMV pp65 HLA A*02:01-restricted NLVPMVATV epitope;

446

SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 269-277 HLA A*02:01-restricted YLQPRTFLL epitope. ProM2 MHC class II

447

biotinylated Monomers were also obtained from ProImmune for the DRB1*07:01-restricted CMV gB

448

215-229 PDDYSNTHSTRYVTV epitope. These biotin-labelled MHC-peptide Pentamers and biotinylated

449

MHC-peptide Monomer complexes, and mouse anti-human CD28 antibody (BD Biosciences) were

450

conjugated to M270 Streptavidin Dynabeads (Thermo Scientific) at defined molar ratios of

451

Pentamer:anti-CD28 and Monomer:anti-CD28 (calculated to account for tetramer formation of these

452

monomers), and both in molar excess of the number of streptavidin molecules per Dynabead. Bead-

453

conjugation was carried out at 4°C in Phospho-buffered saline (PBS, Gibco), for 1 hour with regular

454

agitation. Conjugated VIPR particles were centrifuged at 14,500 xg for 3 minutes at 4°C and washed

455

three times in PBS while the beads were immobilized in an Invitrogen DynaMag-2 magnet (Thermo

456

Scientific). VIPR particles were resuspended in sterile PBS at a concentration of 5x108 particles per ml

457

and stored at 4°C.

458
459

Expansion of antigen-specific T cells by VIPR particles

460

Isolated human CD3+ T cells were cultured in X-VIVO-15 Basal Media (Lonza) supplemented with 10%

461

Human AB Serum Heat Inactivated (Sigma), 6000IU/ml Recombinant Human IL-2 (Peprotech), 5ng/ml

462

Recombinant Human IL-7 (Peprotech), 5ng/ml Recombinant Human IL-15 (Peprotech) and 10mM N-

463

Acetyl-L-cysteine (Sigma). T cells were seeded at a density of 2x105 cells per well of U-bottom 96-well

464

plates, or at a density of 1-2x106 T cells per cm2 of G-REX 24-well plates (Wilson-Wolf). At the time of

465

T cell seeding, VIPR particles were added to the relevant samples at a ratio of 20 T cells per particle,

466

and cells were cultured for 7-days in a 37°C, 5% CO2 culture incubator. In addition, a sample of the T

467

cells was also analyzed by flow cytometry at Day-0 to measure the starting proportion of antigen-

468

specific T cells (see methods below). For some cultures the media was replaced every 2-3 days with

469

fresh complete media including cytokines and NAC (but no extra addition of VIPR particles) and media

470

in G-REX cultures was left unchanged for the duration of 7-days in some experiments to promote cell

471

expansion. On day 7, T cell numbers were assessed by harvesting all cells, washing in PBS followed by

472

centrifugation at 300 xg for 10 minutes and then counting using a CellDrop Automated Cell Counter

473

(DeNovix). The proportion of expanded antigen-specific T cells was assessed at Day-7 by flow

474

cytometry.

Flow cytometry analysis of T cell phenotype

476

For flow cytometric analysis of the antigen-specific T cell population and cell surface marker

477

expression, cells were harvested from culture plates and washed using PBS with 1% Bovine Serum

478

Albumen (Thermo Scientific) and were then stained with monoclonal antibodies specific for CD8

479

(HIT8A, 1:100), CD4 (OKT4, 1:100), HLA-DR (L243 1:80), LAG-3 (11C3C65, 1:80), TIGIT (VSTM3, 1:40),

480

CD45RO (UCHL1, 1:40), CD45RA (HI100, 1:80), TIM3 (F38-2E2, 1:40), CD62L (DREG-56, 1:40), CD57

483

(UCHT1, 1:100) (ThermoFisher). CMV pp65 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen-specific T cells were

484

detected by staining cells with R-PE-labelled Pro5 Pentamers (ProImmune, Ltd), and CMV gB215-229

485

specific T cells stained with R-PE labelled ProT2 Tetramer for 20 minutes at room temperature

486

according to manufacturer’s recommendation. Live/Dead Fixable Dead Cell Stains (Invitrogen) or

487

SYTOX Blue Dead Cell Stain (Invitrogen) were included in all experiments to exclude dead cells. After

488

staining, cells were resuspended in PBS with 2% Human Heat Inactivated AB Serum (Sigma) and 0.1M

489

EDTA pH 8.0 (Invitrogen) before analysis on a Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) and data

490

analyzed using FlowJo 10 software (BD Biosciences).

491
492

Intracellular cytokine staining

493

After 7-days of expansion with VIPR particles, the T cell cultures were stimulated for 6 hours with

494

20𝜇g/ml peptide antigen (>95% purity) specific for the VIPR particle expanded CD8+ population (CMV

495

pp65: NLVPMVATV; SARS-CoV-2 S protein 269-277 YLQPRTFLL), all peptides were synthesized and

496

obtained from ProImmune, Ltd. After 1-hour of peptide stimulation, GolgiStop solution was added

497

(containing Monensin protein transport inhibitor) to block intracellular protein transport (BD

498

Bioscience). As a positive control for cytokine production, T cells were also stimulated for 6 hours

499

with 50ng/ml PMA and 1𝜇g/ml Ionomycin (Sigma). T cells were then harvested, and cells fixed and

500

permeabilized using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilization Solution (ThermoFisher). Cells

501

were then stained for surface markers followed by intracellular cytokines using antibodies specific for

502

IFN-y (4S.B3, 1:40) (Biolegend) IL-2 (MQ1-17H12, 1:40) (BD Bioscience), or TNF-a (MAb11, 1:40)

503

(ThermoFisher). Flow analysis was carried out on a Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) and data

504

analyzed using FlowJo 10 software (BD Biosciences).
