Abstract

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus causing mainly respiratory, but also gastrointestinal
symptoms. Elucidating the molecular processes underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection,
and how the genetic background of an individual is responsible for the variability in
clinical presentation and severity of COVID-19 is essential in understanding this
disease.
Cell infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus requires binding of its Spike (S) protein to the
ACE2 cell surface protein and priming of the S by the serine protease TMPRSS2.
One may expect that genetic variants leading to a defective TMPRSS2 protein can
affect SARS-CoV-2 ability to infect cells. We used a range of bioinformatics methods
to estimate the prevalence and pathogenicity of TMPRSS2 genetic variants in the
human population, and assess whether TMPRSS2 and ACE2 are co-expressed in
the intestine, similarly to what is observed in lungs.
We generated a 3D structural model of the TMPRSS2 extracellular domain using the
prediction server Phyre and studied 378 naturally-occurring TMPRSS2 variants
reported in the GnomAD database. One common variant, p.V160M (rs12329760), is
predicted damaging by both SIFT and PolyPhen2 and has a MAF of 0.25. Valine 160
is a highly conserved residue within the SRCS domain. The SRCS is found in
proteins involved in host defence, such as CD5 and CD6, but its role in TMPRSS2
remains unknown. 84 rare variants (53 missense and 31 leading to a prematurely
truncated protein, cumulative minor allele frequency (MAF) 7.34x10-4) cause
structural destabilization and possibly protein misfolding, and are also predicted
damaging by SIFT and PolyPhen2 prediction tools. Moreover, we extracted gene
expression data from the human protein atlas and showed that both ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 are expressed in the small intestine, duodenum and colon, as well as the
kidneys and gallbladder.
The implications of our study are that: i. TMPRSS2 variants, in particular p.V160M
with a MAF of 0.25, should be investigated as a possible marker of disease severity
and prognosis in COVID-19 and ii. in vitro validation of the co-expression of
TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in gastro-intestinal is warranted.

INTRODUCTION

The transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2) protein has a key role in
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection,
as it is required to prime the virus’ spike (S) protein, thus facilitating its entry into
target cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020), (Shang et al., 2020). TMPRSS2 is characterized
by androgen receptor elements located upstream its transcription site (Lin et al.,
1999). It is expressed in lung and bronchial cells (Lukassen et al., 2020), but also in
the colon, stomach, pancreas, salivary glands, prostate and numerous other tissues
(Vaarala et al., 2001). Moreover, TMPRSS2 has recently been shown to be coexpressed with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) – the SARS-CoV-2
cellular receptor (Zhou et al., 2020) (Hoffmann et al., 2020) – in bronchial and lung
cells (Lukassen et al., 2020).
TMPRSS2 cleaves and activates the S protein of several coronaviruses, including
the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Hoffmann
et al., 2020) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERSCoV) (Du et al., 2017), facilitating virus-cell membrane fusion and viral infection.
TMPRSS2 is also crucial for the proteolytic cleavage and activation of hemagglutinin
(HA) in the influenza A virus (Böttcher et al., 2006).
Studies in TMPRSS2-KO mice reported reduced SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
replication in lungs compared to wild-type mice, and a reduced proinflammatory viral
response, particularly cytokine and chemokine response via the Toll-like receptor 3
pathway (Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019). In vitro studies has shown that TMPRSS2
inhibitors prevent bronchial cell infection by SARS-CoV (Kawase et al., 2012). In
animal studies, mice infected with SARS-CoV and treated with the serine protease
inhibitor Camostat Mesilate showed a high survival rate (Zhou et al., 2015). Recently,
Camostat Mesilate (which, in Japan, is already approved for use in patients with
chronic pancreatitis and postoperative reflux esophagitis) was shown to block SARSCoV-2 lung cell infection in vitro (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Based on these
encouraging results, a clinical trial to study the effect of a TMPRSS2 inhibitor in
COVID-19 patients is under way (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04321096).
Since pharmacological block of TMPRSS2 prevents cell entry and infection by
coronavirus, one could postulate that naturally occurring TMPRSS2 genetic variants
affecting the structure and function of the TMPRSS2 protein may confer some
protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed a computational bioinformatics
analysis on TMPRSS2 variants reported in GnomAD, the database of population
genetic variations, to identify variants that could result in TMPRSS2 loss of

structure/function, and assess their prevalence in the general population using data
from the GnomAD database. Moreover, we explored the co-expression of TMPRSS2
and ACE2 in extrapulmonary tissues using data from the Human protein Atlas,
focusing on the intestine in view of the high prevalence of diarrhoea and
gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients (Chen et al., 2020).

METHODS

TMPRSS2 variants, with their global and gender-specific minor allele frequency
(MAF), were extracted from GnomAD (Karczewski et al., 2017). Cumulative MAF
was calculated as the sum of the MAFs for each variant.
In order to assess the structural impact of TMPRSS2 variants, the three-dimensional
structure of the TMPRSS2 was required. Currently, no experimental 3D structure for
TMPRSS2 is available. We, therefore, generated a 3D structural model using our inhouse Phyre homology modelling algorithm (Kelley et al., 2015). The FASTA
sequence of TMPRSS2 was obtained from the UniProt protein knowledge database
(The UniProt Consortium, 2017) (UniProt Id O15393, corresponding to 492 amino
acid transcript Ensembl ID ENST00000332149.10). We deposited the 3D
coordinates of the model in our PhyreRisk (Ofoegbu et al., 2019) database
(http://phyrerisk.bc.ic.ac.uk/search?action=fresh-search&searchTerm=TMPRSS2).
For completeness, SWISS-MODEL (Waterhouse et al., 2018) was also implemented
to model TMPRSS2.
Model quality was assessed using: i. VoroMQA (Voronoi tessellation-based Model
Quality Assessment) (Olechnovič and Venclovas, 2017), a statistical-based tool
based on inter-atomic and solvent contact areas, which returns both a local and
global score between 0 and 1. A global score > 0.4 indicates a good model and < 0.3
a poor model, models with >0.3 score <0.4 cannot be correctly classified; ii.
QMEANDisCO (Studer et al., 2020), which uses distance restraints calculated from
experimental structures of proteins homologous to the query protein and returns a
plot of local IDDT (distance difference comparison) scores for each residue between
0 and 1. A global IDTT >0.6 indicates a good model structure. iii. ProSA (Wiederstein
and Sippl, 2007). The latter returns: 1. the Z-score, which indicates the overall model
quality of the target structure compared to the Z-score for all experimentally
determined structures in PDB (X-rays and NMR); 2. the residue energy, which
indicates the local model quality and is calculated over a 10- and 40-residue window.
Negative energy values indicate good quality structure.
The impact of each variant on TMPRSS2 protein structure was assessed by
analysing the following 16 features, using our in house algorithm Missense3D
(Ittisoponpisan et al., 2019): breakage of a disulfide bond, hydrogen bond or salt
bridge, introduction of a buried proline, clash, introduction of hydrophilic residue,
introduction of a buried charged residue, charge switch in a buried residue, alteration
in secondary structure, replacement of charged with uncharged buried residue,
introduction of a disallowed phi/psi region, replacement of a buried glycine with any

other residue, alteration in a cavity, replacement of cis proline, buried to exposed
residue switch, replacement of a glycine located in a bend. In addition, we used the
SIFT (Vaser et al., 2016) and Polyphen2 (Adzhubei et al., 2010) variant predictors,
which mainly use evolutionary conservation to assess a variant’s effect.
The effect of variant rs12329760 was further assess using: i. CONDEL (GonzálezPérez and López-Bigas, 2011) which reports a weighted average of the scores from
fatHMM and MutationAssessor, and ii. FoldX5 force field (Schymkowitz et al., 2005)
which calculate the stability of a protein based on the estimation of its free energy. A

ΔΔG > 0 kcal/mol (calculated as: ΔΔG= ΔGmut – ΔGwt) was predicted to have a
destabilizing effect.

post-mortem tissue samples, and iii. RNA-seq values from the Functional Annotation
of Mammalian Genomes 5 (FANTOM5) project. HPA provides normalized expression
(NX) values. In brief, to take into account the removal of non-coding transcripts, the
Transcripts Per Million (TPM) values within each sample were adjusted to sum to one
million. Thereafter, library size and composition differences were accounted for by
applying a trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) normalisation to the sample TPM
values. Then Pareto scaling was applied at gene level within each of the data
sources. Batch effects were removed when the tissue data from the three source
datasets was integrated. Where a tissue has multiple sub-tissues, the reported NX
value was the maximum NX value across all the sub-tissues. A consensus transcript
expression level was produced for each gene and tissue, by selecting the maximum
NX value for this combination across the three data sources. Further details are
available from the HPA website http://www.proteinatlas.org.

RESULTS

TMPRSS2 protein
TMPRSS2 is composed of a cytoplasmic region (residues 1-84), a transmembrane
region (amino acids 85-105) and an extracellular region (residues 106-492). The
latter is composed of three domains: the LDLR class A (residues 112-149), the
scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain 2 (SRCR-2) (residues 150-242) and the
Peptidase S1 (residues 256-489), which contains the protease active site: residues
H296, D345 and S441. Two potential glycosylation sites are present in positions 213
and 249. A cleavage site at residues 255-256 has been shown to allow shedding of
the extracellular region of TMPRSS2 (Afar et al., 2001).
No known experimental structure for TMPRSS2 is currently available. We therefore
generated a 3D model of the extracellular region residues 145-491 corresponding to
domains SRCR and Peptidase S1 (Figure 1 and Figure 2 and Table 1) using the
transmembrane serine protease hepsin as a template (PDB: 1Z8G, chain A, X-ray
structure with 1.55Å resolution. Model confidence 100%, sequence Id= 35% to target
sequence; Model assessment:.VoroMQA score = 0.462, QMEANDisCO score =0.67,
and ProSA Z score = -8.96, also see Supplementary Figure S1. RMSD Phyre model
vs SWISS-MODEL =0.30Å). A second model covering residues 111-150 (LDLRA
domain) was generated using as a template PDB: 4U8U (giant haemoglobin), chain
O, resolution 3.2Å (model confidence 97%, sequence Id= 30% to target sequence.
(ProSA Z score= -3.08. VoroMQA score= 0.267, however this may not accurately
reflect model quality since the software was trained on chains with more than 99
residues). Given the similarity of the Phyre and the SWISS-MODEL structures, the
subsequent analysis should not be particularly sensitive to which model was
selected.

this variant (9,587 homozygotes out of 141,456 individuals sequenced as part of the
GnomAd project). This variant is predicted damaging by both SIFT (score=0.01) and
PolyPhen2 (score=0.937). CONDEL also predicts this substitution to be damaging
(score=0.788). Valine 160 is a highly conserved, small hydrophobic residue within
the SRCS domain and may have a structural or functional role within TMPRSS2
(Figure 3). On manual inspection, substitution of valine with the large methionine may
cause some degree of steric clash within the structure. However, this was not
supported by the change in free energy (ΔΔGFoldX -0.47 kcal/mol).
The p.V160M substitution may affect TMPRSS2 function. The SRCS is a highly
conserved domain, whose function is still not fully understood, although a role in
ligand and/or protein interaction has been proposed (Aruffo et al., 1997).
Interestingly, this domain is present in several proteins involved in host defence, such
as CD5, CD6 and Complement factor I (Freeman et al., 1990), (Resnick et al., 1994).

31 variants lead to a prematurely truncated protein (17 frameshift variants causing
premature termination and 14 stop gain variants). 304 out of 334 missense variants
were mapped onto the 3D structure and 62 variants were predicted structurally
damaging by Missense3D. Of these, 12 variants (p.C113R, p.C113Y, p.C139R,
p.C185Y, p.C244F, p.231S, p.C244R, p.C281F, p.C281R, p.C297Y, p.C410Y,
p.C465Y) result in substitution of the invariable cysteine forming disulfide bonds and
are highly likely to cause destabilization and possibly misfolding of the TMPRSS2
protein structure. Further analysis showed that two variants disrupt TMPRSS2
function: p.R255S (rs769655195), which abolishes the TMPRSS2 cleavage site and
p.S441G (rs1292701415), which abolishes TMPRSS2 active site. However, both
variants are extremely rare in the population (MAF<1x10-5) and are unlikely to be
useful as a marker of SARS-CoV-2 infection severity.
167 variants were predicted damaging by SIFT and 152 by Polyphen2. 137 variants
were predicted damaging by both SIFT and PolyPhen2, and of these, 53 variants
were also predicted to cause structural damage, thus reinforcing the damaging effect
predicted for these variants.
The 84 variants (53 missense and 31 leading to a prematurely truncated protein) that
are predicted to cause loss of function with a high degree of confidence (predicted
damaging by all three methods) are rare in the population. Their average MAF in the
population is 9.67×10-6 and their cumulative MAF of 7.34×10-4, therefore unlikely to
be helpful as a marker of SARS-CoV-2 infection severity in the general population.

Both TMPRSS2 and ACE2 are expressed in the intestine
We extracted data on TMPRSS2 and ACE2 tissue expression from the Human
Protein Atlas. As shown in Figure 4, both proteins are expressed in the gut: colon,
small intestine and duodenum. Other sites of expression are the kidneys and
gallbladder. Interestingly, although TMPRSS2 and ACE2 have recently been shown
to be co-expressed in the lung and bronchial cells, ACE2 lung expression is almost
negligible in the HPA, thus highlighting that specific in vitro experiments are
necessary to study the co-expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in extrapulmonary
tissues. Moreover, although expression of ACE2 arterial and venous endothelial cells
and arterial smooth muscle cells was previously demonstrated (Hamming et al.,
2004), it is not reported in the HPA.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

As of May 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions of people around the world and
has caused over 300,000 deaths. However, the true number of infected individuals
remains unknown, as studies have suggested that many remain asymptomatic or
have a mild symptoms (Day, 2020), (Song et al.). Naturally occurring genetic
variations that result in a defective TMPRSS2 may explain why some individuals with
COVID-19 develop mild disease. Our in silico analysis of TMPRSS2 human variants
shows that the predicted damaging substitution from valine to methionine at position
160 is a common genetic variant, present in almost 25% percent of the human
population, with approximately 7% homozygotes according to GnomAd. TMPRSS2
variants should be investigated further to understand the impact of a person’s genetic
background on their clinical presentation and prognosis when contracting SARSCoV-2 .
Once SARS-CoV-2 infects an individual, it binds to ACE2 receptors on the surface of
target cells. However, for the virus to enter the cells, double cleavage of the viral
spike protein at the S1/S2 cleavage site and, subsequently, at the S2’ site is
required. This allows viral fusion with the cell membrane and internalization
(Hoffmann et al., 2020). TMPRSS2 is one the main cell surface proteases involved in
the process of spike protein priming, although additional proteases, such as Furin
and lysosomal cathepsin, are thought to be involved (Shang et al., 2020).
At present no known disease-association for TMPRSS2 variants is known. A
chromosomal aberration leading to gene fusion of TMPRSS2 and its androgen
promoter to ERG, known as the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene, has been identified in
approximately one half of patients with prostate cancer (Haffner et al., 2010). Genetic
variants leading to a defective and non-functioning TMPRSS2 and ACE2 are
promising prognostic candidates for COVID-19 infection. Recent studies show that
ACE2 genetic variation is very rare in the population (Stawiski et al.) (MacGowan and
Barton), thus making it an unlikely candidate to explain the wide range of symptoms
(from asymptomatic to severely affected) observed in COVID-19 patients. We,
therefore, focused on TMPRSS2, which together with ACE2 plays an important role
in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although the majority of TMPRSS2 variants are rare, the
common variant V160M, which is predicted damaging, is an intriguing candidate for
further study. Valine 160 is a highly conserved residue in the SRCS domain. It has
been proposed that the latter may be involved in protein and/or ligand binding (Aruffo
et al., 1997), however no known protein interaction partner is known to-date. The
SRCR domain is often found in proteins involved in host defence (Freeman et al.,

1990), (Resnick et al., 1994), thus raising the possibility that the role of TMPRSS2 in
SARS-CoV-2 infection may extend beyond its peptidase activity related to viral
protein priming.
Although respiratory tract infection is the most common manifestation of COVID-19,
diarrhoea and gastrointestinal symptoms are also common. The co-expression of
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 has been studied and experimentally ascertained in bronchial
and lung cells, however co-expression of these proteins in the gut has not yet been
investigated. We, therefore, used RNA expression data from the Human Protein
Atlas (Uhlén et al., 2015) to show that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are both expressed in
the intestine. This suggests that, similarly to the lung, cells in the intestine may be
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in gastro-intestinal symptoms in many
patients, including children presenting with Kawasaki-like syndrome. This appealing
pathogenetic hypothesis needs further ad hoc in vitro confirmation. It is, in fact,
notable that the lung expression of ACE2, confirmed by dedicated in vitro studies
(Lukassen et al., 2020), and its expression in arterial and venous endothelial cells
and arterial smooth muscle cells (Hamming et al., 2004) are not reported in the HPA,
thus suggesting that HPA data are incomplete.
In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus and still very little is known about the
pathogenesis of COVID-19. Elucidating the molecular processes underlying SARSCoV-2 infection and the factors responsible for the broad spectrum of disease
severity observed in COVID-19 patients is crucial. Our data suggest that (i)
TMPRSS2 variants, particularly p.V160M which has a MAF of 0.25,

should be

investigated as a marker of disease prognosis and (ii) in vitro validation of the coexpression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in gastrointestinal cells is needed.
