Abstract
Resident mesenchymal cells (rMCs defined as Cd31NegCd45NegEpcamNeg) control the selfrenewal and differentiation of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) stem cells in vitro. The identity
of these rMCs is still elusive. Among them, Axin2Pos mesenchymal alveolar niche cells
(MANCs), which are expressing Fgf7, have been previously described. We propose that an
additional population of rMCs, expressing Fgf10 (called rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos) are equally
important to maintain AT2 stem cell self-renewal.
The alveolosphere model, based on the AT2-rMC co-culture in growth factor reduced
Matrigel, was used to test the efficiency of different rMC subpopulations isolated by FACS
from adult murine lung to sustain the self-renewal and differentiation of AT2 stem cells.
We demonstrate that rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos cells are efficient to promote the self-renewal and
differentiation of AT2 stem cells. Co-staining of adult lung for Fgf10 mRNA and Sftpc
protein respectively, indicate that 28% of Fgf10Pos cells are located close to AT2 cells. CoISH for Fgf7 and Fgf10 indicate that these two populations do not significantly overlap. Gene
arrays comparing rMC-Sca1PosAxin2Pos and rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos support that these two cell
subsets express differential markers. In addition, rMC function is decreased in diabetic and
obese ob/ob mutant compared to WT mice with a much stronger loss of function in males
compared to females.
In conclusion, rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos cells play important role in supporting AT2 stem cells
self-renewal and differentiation. This result sheds a new light on the subpopulations of rMCs
contributing to the AT2 stem cell niche in homeostasis and in the context of COVID-19
pathogenesis.

Key message
What is already known about the subject?
Resident mesenchymal cells (rMCs defined as Cd31NegCd45NegEpcamNeg) control the selfrenewal and differentiation of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) stem cells in vitro. The identity
of these rMCs is still elusive. Among them, Axin2Pos mesenchymal alveolar niche cells
(MANCs), which are expressing Fgf7, have been previously described.
What does this study add?
Our study shows that an additional population of rMCs, expressing Fgf10 (called rMCSca1PosFgf10Pos) is equally important to maintain AT2 stem cell self-renewal. rMCSca1PosFgf10Pos are LipidToxHigh and are located close to AT2s. In addition, rMCSca1PosFgf10Pos cells support AT2 stem cell self-renewal and differentiation thereby
identifying these cells as bone fide functional lipofibroblasts (LIFs). We have previously
reported that LIF can transdifferentiate into activated MYF in the context of bleomycininduced fibrosis in mice [1] and that activated MYF isolated from the lungs of end stage
idiopathic fibrosis human patients can respond to Metformin to undergo transdifferentiation
back to the LIF phenotype [2]. We also show that the function of rMCs-Sca1Pos is negatively
impacted by gender and obesity, which represent two major aggravating factors for COVID19 pathogenesis, leading to either death or major complications after infection recovery such
as lung fibrosis.
How might this impact on clinical practice and future development?
By establishing that rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos are different from the MANCs, our study opens the
way for a new key mesenchymal cell population that should be targeted to either prevent or
reverse fibrosis. In addition, as this population maintains the AT2 stem cells self-renewal and
differentiation, such targeting will also allow to progressively recover the loss in respiratory
function.

Introduction
Lung fibrosis is characterized by an accumulation in the respiratory airways of mesenchymal
cells, called activated myofibroblasts (MYF) which over time, lead to impaired lung function
[3]. Through the use of single cell transcriptomic approach, the heterogeneity of the different
resident mesenchymal (rMC) populations present in the lung is starting to emerge. A key
stromal cell is represented by the lipofibroblasts (LIFs), which are rich in lipid-droplets and
can be stained and isolated using the vital dye LipidTox (LT). They express Perilipin 2,
platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra) and are negative for Acta2 and most
importantly are located close to alveolar type 2 cells (AT2) [4]. They are proposed to supply
AT2s with the triglycerides needed for the elaboration of surfactant. Using a co-culture assay
of PdgfrαHigh mesenchymal cells and AT2s in growth factor reduced Matrigel, it has been
proposed that the rMC-LIFs are essential for the maintenance of the self-renewal and
differentiation of AT2 stem cells [5].
Fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10) is a mesenchymal-specific gene expressed in the distal
part of the embryonic lung during the early pseudoglandular stage [6]. Our lineage tracing
analyses have shown that a subpopulation of Fgf10Pos cells at embryonic day 12.5 serves as
progenitor for rMC-LIFs at later stages of lung development. Additionally, in postnatal lungs,
around 30% of rMC-LIF express the Fgf10 gene [7]. The relevance of these rMC-Fgf10Pos
LIF in maintaining the self-renewal and differentiation of AT2 stem cells remains to be
demonstrated.

Interestingly,

another population

of stromal cells, called

MANC

(Mesenchymal Alveolar Niche Cells), which are positive for Axin2, Pdgfra, Wnt2, Il6 and
Fgf7 [8], were also described to locate close to AT2 cells. How different are the rMCFgf10pos LIFs to the MANC is still unclear.
Using lineage tracing, we previously reported the reversible transdifferentiation of the LIFs
into activated MYF during fibrosis formation and resolution [1]. In addition, Metformin, a

first line antidiabetic drug has been reported to enhance the activated MYF to LIF transition
both in vitro and in vivo [2]. Repetitive damages to AT2s have been proposed to be linked to
the development of lung fibrosis. Interestingly, one of the major and long-term complication
for patients who survived SARS-CoV-2 infection (leading to COVID-19 disease) is fibrosis
[9,10]. SARS-CoV-2 binds to its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) mostly
abundantly expressed in the AT2s. Massive damages to the AT2s likely unleashes the
associated LIFs to become activated MYFs, thereby leading to fibrosis. Pertinent to this
background, obesity/diabetes and gender have been proposed to be predictive factors for the
severity of the disease [11,12].
In this paper, we used the in vitro alveolosphere model based on the AT2-rMC co-culture in
growth factor reduced Matrigel to test the efficiency of different rMC subpopulations isolated
by FACS from adult murine lung. We used antibodies against Cd45, Cd31, Epcam and Stem
cell antigen 1 (Sca1) to refine the initial rMC population responsible for the maintenance of
AT2 stem cells. Using a fluorescent substrate for ß-galactosidase activity, rMCSca1PosFgf10Pos as well as rMC-Sca1PosAxin2Pos cells were sorted. Additional sorting was
achieved using LT staining for cells containing high level of neutral lipids. After 2 weeks of
co-culture, organoid size and colony forming efficiency were quantified. RNAscope with
Fgf7- and Fgf10-labelled riboprobes, to label rMC-Axin2Pos and rMC-Fgf10Pos respectively,
combined with Sftpc immunofluorescence on adult lungs was carried out. Gene array
analyses were used to characterize sorted rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos vs. rMC-Sca1PosAxin2Pos. We
used males and females C57BL6 and corresponding ob/ob mutant mice to determine the
impact of obesity and gender on the functional capacity of the corresponding rMCs-Sca1Pos to
sustain AT2 stem cells.
Our results indicate that an rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos/LIFPos subpopulation is essential for the
self-renewal of the AT2 stem cells. This subpopulation is likely different from the previously

described MANC. In addition, obesity and gender impact the capacity of rMCs to maintain
the self-renewal of AT2 stem cells indicating that future therapeutic approaches should be
focussed on restoring the function of the mesenchymal niche.

Results

The capacity of Cd45NegCd31NegEpcamNeg resident mesenchymal cells (rMCs) to
functionally support the self-renewal and differentiation of alveolar epithelial type 2
(AT2) stem cells is associated with Stem cell antigen 1 (Sca1) expression
The aim of this study is to refine the adult lung resident mesenchymal cell population, called
thereafter rMC and defined by flow cytometry as Cd45NegCd31NegEpcamNeg cells. This cell
population is capable of sustaining AT2 stem cell renewal using the previously described
alveolosphere in vitro assay [5]. In this approach, the use of antibodies against Cd45 and
Cd31 allowed us to remove, from the target subpopulation, the hematopoietic and endothelial
cells, respectively.
In the context of a previous milestone study generating organoids in Matrigel arising from a
co-culture of EpcamHigh Cd24Low epithelial cells (previously called epithelial stem/progenitor
cells or EpiSPC) with rMC, it was demonstrated that rMC expressing the stem cell antigen 1
(Sca1) were capable of sustaining the self-renewal and differentiation of these cells [13,14].
However, in this study, the impact of the different subpopulations of rMCs on AT2 stem cell
self-renewal and differentiation was not analysed.
For this purpose, we have sorted an enriched population of mature AT2 cells from the
SftpcCreERT2/+; Tomatoflox/+ lungs. We started first by isolating Cd31NegCd45NegEpcamPos cells
and then applied two successive and stringent sorting approaches: first using LysoTracker, a
fluorescent dye that labels acidic compartments found abundantly in the lamellar bodies of
AT2 cells and second, using the tomato reporter expressed specifically in AT2 cells (Fig.

out 6 independent co-cultures. rMCs-Sca1Pos represent around 25% of the total rMC
population (Fig. 1A). When co-cultured with sorted mature AT2s, rMCs-Sca1Pos led to the
formation of organoids (Fig. 1B) with a colony forming efficiency of 5% (Fig. 1C) which is
in line with previously published alveolosphere experiments. Interestingly, rMCs-Sca1Neg fail
to sustain alveolosphere formation (Fig. 1B). The difference in organoid size and CFE is
highly significant between the two rMC subpopulations (Fig. 1C, P < 0.01).

rMCs-Sca1Pos can be further functionally subdivided for the self-renewal and
differentiation of AT2 stem cells on the basis of LipidTox staining
To better characterize rMCs-Sca1Pos lung cells and in particular whether this population may
include the lipofibroblasts (LIFs), we used LipidTOX (LT), an efficient fluorescent stain for
neutral lipid. As LIFs are abundant in neutral lipid droplets, LT has been previously used to
quantify LIF population during lung development [4].
Sorted rMCs-Sca1PosLTHigh and rMCs-Sca1PosLTNeg were tested functionally in the
alveolosphere model for their capacity to induce the self-renewal and differentiation of AT2
stem cells (Fig. 2A). For this experiment, we pooled the cells from 3 mice and carried 4
independent co-cultures. When co-cultured with sorted mature AT2s, rMCs-Sca1PosLTHigh led
to the formation of organoids (Fig. 2B) with a colony forming efficiency of 2% (Fig. 2C)
while rMCs-Sca1PosLTNeg failed to sustain organoid formation. We also carried out at day 14,
Immunofluorescence (IF) for LT (LIF marker), Hopx (AT1 cell marker) and DAPI in
conjunction with the detection of the endogenous tomato reporter (Fig. 2B). Our results
indicate LTPos cells are located in the periphery of each organoid. In addition, we observed
abundant expression of Hopx within the organoid indicating proper AT2 to AT1
differentiation. RT-qPCR was also carried out to quantify the expression of Fgf10 and Pdfra,
two well-known markers enriched in LIFs (Fig. 2D). Our results indicate a trend towards an

increase in the expression of Fgf10 and Pdgfra in rMCs-Sca1PosLTHigh compared to rMCsSca1PosLTNeg (n=3 independent mice) (Fig. 2D). These results are in line with the previous
observation that Fgf10 and Pdgfra are also expressed in cells other than LIFs [4,15]. Overall,
our data therefore support the previous conclusion that it is the LIF subpopulation of the
rMCs that can preferentially support AT2 stem cell survival and differentiation.

Fgf10Pos cells represent a niche for AT2 cells
We have previously reported that during development, a subset of Fgf10Pos cells are
progenitors for lipofibroblasts (LIFs) in the late stage of development and postnatally. We
have also reported that during the early postnatal stage of lung development, only 28% of the
LIFs express Fgf10 indicating that the LIFs, like Fgf10Pos cells [7], are an heterogenous
population. To functionally evaluate the difference between rMCs-Sca1PosFgf10Pos and rMCsSca1PosFgf10Neg cells, we used the Fgf10LacZ reporter line in combination with the ßgalactosidase fluorescent substrate FDG to sort, from rMCs, enriched populations of FDGPos
(Fgf10Pos) and FDGNeg (Fgf10Neg) cells. We then isolated the Sca1Pos fraction for each
subpopulation. Our results indicate that rMCs-Sca1PosFgf10Pos represents around 33% of the
rMCs-Fgf10Pos and 25% of the rMCs-Sca1Pos. These results indicate that the rMCs-Sca1Pos as
well as the rMCs-Fgf10Pos subpopulation are indeed heterogeneous (Fig. 3A). As previously
described, we have co-cultured rMCs-Sca1PosFgf10Pos as well as rMCs-Sca1PosFgf10Neg cells
with AT2 in our alveolosphere assay. Our results indicate that organoid only form with
rMCs-Sca1PosFgf10Pos with a CFE of 4% (n=4 independent experiments) (Fig. 3B and D).
rMCs-Sca1PosFgf10Neg are not capable of eliciting organoid formation. IF Staining of the
organoids for Hopx show that the AT2 cells properly differentiate into AT1 cells (Fig. 3C).

Comparison of rMCs-Sca1PosFgf10Pos vs. rMCs-Sca1PosAxin2Pos
Fgf10Pos cells are progenitor for lipofibroblast. LIF in alveolar region are functionally
important to support AT2 cells during lung development and postnatal stages. In addition,
Axin2, a marker for Wnt signalling activation, is expressed in a subset of mesenchymal cells
in the adult lung [16]. It has been reported that 74% of Axin2Pos cells in the alveolar region
are also expressing Pdgfrα. Axin2Pos PdgfrαPos mesenchymal cells are called mesenchymal
alveolar niche cells (MANC) and are located closed to AT2 cells. Using the alveolosphere
model they have been reported to sustain AT2 stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. As
these cells have been described to express Fgf7 and not Fgf10 [8], we propose that rMCsSca1PosFgf10Pos and rMCs-Sca1PosAxin2Pos represent two independent pools of niche cells for
AT2 stem cells.
To better characterize these two rMC subpopulations, we used specific reporter lines;
Fgf10LacZ and Axin2LacZ to monitor the distribution of LipidTOX staining in these two sublineages. By using FACSAria III cell sorter, we analysed 100,000 events, each sample
contained harvested lung from one mouse -with the same age range (6-8 weeks old).
Cd45NegCd31NegEpcamNegSca1Pos sorted cells were processed for further analysis (Fig. 4A).
For Fgf10LacZ lungs, we found 25% FDGPos (rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos) cells out of total rMCSca1Pos. For Axin2LacZ lungs, our results indicate around 10% FDGPos (rMC-Sca1PosAxin2Pos)
cells out of total rMC-Sca1Pos. Further analysis based on LipidTox staining indicate that 85%
of Fgf10Pos and 98% of rMC-Sca1PosAxin2Pos cells were also LTHigh cells (Fig 4B and C,
respectively). Based on LT staining, we also report that most of the rMCs-Sca1PosFgf10Neg as
well as rMCs-Sca1PosAxin2Neg subpopulations contain a high percentile of LTLow/High
suggesting again a functional heterogeneity at the level of the LIFs (in regards to the
maintenance of AT2 stem cell self-renewal) based on whether they express or not Fgf10 or
Axin2.

In order to better define at the transcriptomic level the difference between rMCsSca1PosFgf10Pos and rMCs-Sca1PosAxin2Pos, we performed gene array analysis using the
Agilent platform. Fig 4D shows top 100 genes which differentially expressed between rMCsSca1PosFgf10Pos and rMCs-Sca1PosFgf10Neg subsets. The genes differentially regulated
between these two substets were then evaluated in rMCs-Sca1PosAxin2Pos cells. Our results
indicate that several markers such as Ackr4, Jchain, Cd46, Alox5, Nfam1 and Col10a1 could
be differentially expressed between rMCs-Sca1PosFgf10Pos and rMCs-Sca1PosAxin2Pos and
therefore used in the future to label these mesenchymal subpopulations. KEGG analysis of
rMCs-Sca1PosAxin2Pos vs. rMCs-Sca1PosFgf10Pos indicates an upregulation of metabolic
pathways, RNA transport, DNA replication as well as cell cycle indicating that the AxinPos
cells are metabolically active and proliferative (Fig. S1). Altogether, our data notably suggest
that rMCs-Sca1PosFgf10Pos cells are likely different from rMCs-Sca1PosAxin2Pos cells.

Fgf10 expressing cells are located close to SftpcPos cells
To investigate the relative interaction between Fgf10 expressing cells and AT2 cells, we
combined the in-situ hybridization technique for detecting Fgf10 mRNA expression with
immunofluorescence staining for pro-SPC in adult wild type lungs. We found that 28% ± 1%
(n=3) of total Fgf10 expressing cells are located close to pro-SPC expressing cells (Fig. 5A).
This number is very similar to the one we reported before in the newborn lung using the
Fgf10LacZ reporter [4]. This observation suggests that a subset only of the Fgf10 expressing
cells constitutes a critical component of the alveolar niche that may robustly communicate
with AT2 cells. To better define the heterogeneity of AT2 stromal niche, we have also
performed co-staining of Fgf7 mRNA and Sftpc. Fgf7 expression has been proposed to be a
hallmark of the MANC population. To validate the Fgf7 mRNA probe, we used Fgf7 KO

adult lungs. While a clear signal was obtained with a positive control probe provided by the
manufacturer, the Fgf7 mRNA probe failed to generate a signal in the Fgf7 KO lungs (Fig.
S2) indicating that the signal observed in wild type lung is specific (Fig. 5B). We found that
around only 2.0% ± 0.2% (n=3) of Fgf7 expressing cells are in vicinity of SftpcPos cells (Fig.
5B). Finally, we performed a co-staining for Fgf7 and Fgf10 mRNA using different
fluorescent labelled probes. Our results indicate that 15.7% ± 3.0% (n=3) of total cells are
Fgf7 expressing cells vs. 25.0% ± 2.0% (n=3) for Fgf10 expressing cells. Finally, 4.0% ±
0.7% (n=3) of total cells are double positive Fgf10/Fgf7 cells (Fig. 5C). Taken together,
these data suggest that the rMCs-Sca1PosFgf10Pos are distinct from Fgf7Pos MANC, while both
subpopulations are located close to AT2 cells.

rMCs-Sca1Pos are impacted by obesity and gender
Patients who survived SARS-CoV-2 infection often develop lung fibrosis [9]. AT2 cells are
proposed to be the main target of SARS-CoV-2 because of their widely distributed
expression of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), a major receptor for this virus. As
massive damages to the AT2s occur following the viral infection, it is likely that this process
leads to the transdifferentiation of the LIFs into activated MYFs, thereby leading to fibrosis
formation [1]. Obesity/diabetes and gender have been proposed to be aggravating preexisting conditions predicting the severity of the disease [11].
To explore the impact of obesity/diabetes and gender on the functionality of the rMCsSca1Pos cells, we used 6-8 weeks C57BL6 males and females as well as Leptin-deficient
Ob/Ob (aka Ob/Ob) mutant male and female mice (n=2 for each gender and for WT and
mutant). Fig. 6A shows the analysis by flow cytometry analysis of rMCs-Sca1Pos in C57BL/6
mice vs. C57BL/6 Leptin-deficient Ob/Ob mice. Interestingly, a drastic reduction of the

vs. 9%, respectively). We also functionally tested the rMCs-Sca1Pos from these different mice
by co-culturing them with sorted AT2 cells using the alveolosphere assay. When the rMCsSca1Pos are isolated from Ob/Ob male mice presenting the two risk factors, obesity and male
(Fig. 6B), we observed a complete absence of organoid formation (n=2). However, when
rMCs-Sca1Pos are isolated from female Ob/Ob mice presenting only obesity as a risk factor, a
significant number of organoids are present (3% CFE, n=2). This CFE is, however, lower
than the one observed in non-obese C57BL6 female wild type mice (5% CFE, n=2)
indicating that obesity alone is already impacting the functionality of the rMCs-Sca1Pos.
Interestingly, non-obese C57BL6 male wild type mice display also a reduced CFE compared
to non-obese C57BL6 female wild type mice (2% vs. 5%, respectively, n=2) indicating that
the gender alone is also impacting the functionality of the rMCs-Sca1Pos. We also observed
that age, another risk factor for COVID-19, was also having the same effect than obesity and
gender on the capacity of the rMCs-Sca1Pos to maintain the self-renewal of the AT2 stem
cells (data not shown).

Discussion

rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos are different from the rMC-Sca1PosAxin2Pos
A major problem arising from key publications using flow cytometry as a primary
experimental approach is the lack of independent studies reporting the reproducibility of the
results. This is due in part to the type of flow sorter used, the sophisticated flow cytometry
protocols, including the gating conditions used and the lack of comparison with other
endogenous population at the time of the sort as internal controls. This is particularly crucial
in the context of the lung mesenchyme which is still a huge black box both in human and in
mice in spite of recent scRNA seq studies [17].In our study, we adopted an unbiased and
reproducible FACS strategy to sort both epithelial and mesenchymal populations. We used
Sca1 as a resident mesenchymal stem cell marker to refine the rMC population. In previous
studies, Cd45NegCd31NegSca1Pos cells (please note that Epcam was not used in that study)
were detectable in the postnatal lung coincidently with the transition from the saccular to the
alveolar stage of lung development. This population also co-expressed Cd34, Thy1 (Cd90),
as well as Pdgfrα and was proposed to mark LIFs [18]. Interestingly, our gene array data
shows that Cd90 is highly expressed in rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos compared to rMCSca1PosAxin2Pos

(data

In

that

Cd45NegCd31NegSca1Pos could be refined into two main subpopulations, namely
Cd166PosCd90Neg and Cd166NegCd90Pos. The Cd166NegCd90Pos subpopulation contained
undifferentiated mesenchymal progenitors capable of differentiating towards the LIF and
MYF lineage while the Cd166PosCd90Neg subpopulation contained more differentiated
mesenchymal

cells

lineage.

Additionally,

the

Cd166NegCd90Pos expressed high levels of Fgf10 [14]. Taken together, our rMCSca1PosFgf10Pos correspond to a specifically enriched population of LIFs capable of

maintaining AT2 stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. A recent milestone study
published in Cell described a mesenchymal cell subpopulation called MANC (Mesenchymal
Alveolar Niche Cells), which was positive for Axin2, Pdgfra, Wnt2, Il6 and Fgf7 [8]. MANCs
are located close to AT2s and sustain in vitro the self-renewal and differentiation of AT2
stem cells. The current knowledge, before this study was therefore that the MANC are
considered at the top of a hierarchy of mesenchymal niche cells and are likely to be important
for both homeostasis and repair after injury. The current study brings into light a novel
challenger for this important role. Our results indicate that rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos are likely
different from the rMC-Sca1PosAxin2Pos (aka the MANC, but isolated in our experimental
conditions) but has, nonetheless a similar function in regards to the AT2 stem cells.

Are the rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos more relevant than the rMC-Sca1PosAxin2Pos for the repair
process after injury?
Given the fact that both subpopulations appear to sustain the self-renewal and differentiation
of AT2 stem cells in vitro, a natural question is therefore whether they have redundant
functions or whether one population appears to be more crucial than the other. From the
angle of Fgf signalling and based on the consequence of Fgf7 versus Fgf10 gene inactivation
in mice, we can conclude that rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos are likely more important than rMCSca1PosAxin2Pos. Fgf10 inactivation leads to lung agenesis [19] while Fgf7 null mice are
viable and display no obvious lung phenotype [20]. Changes in endogenous Fgf10 expression
has been correlated with disease progression and/or repair after lung injury both in mice and
humans [21–23]. Evidence for such a role for Fgf7 in the embryonic or adult lung in human
or mice are still lacking in spite of the fact that Fgf7 was discovered 7 years before Fgf10
[24,25]. Another important question is whether it matters if the most efficient mesenchymal
niche cells express Fgf7 versus Fgf10 as they are both ligands are acting through Fgfr2b.

Indeed, it does matter as Fgf7 and Fgf10, although belonging to the same Fgf subfamily of
paracrine growth factors elicit different biological activities on isolated lung epithelium
grown in Matrigel in vitro [6]. While Fgf10 induces the formation of new buds by a process
of chemotaxis, Fgf7 triggers the proliferation of the epithelium leading to the formation of a
cyst-like structure. Mass spectrometry studies demonstrated that Fgf10 differentially
stimulated the phosphorylation of tyrosine 734 of Fgfr2b and the recruitment of the SH3domain-binding protein 4 (SH3bp4) [26]. Tyrosine 734 phosphorylation controls the
trafficking route of the receptor after internalization, allowing receptor recycling at the cell
surface and sustained Akt and Shc phosphorylation. Knockdown of SH3bp4 or ectopic
expression of a Y734F-mutated form of Fgfr2b in lung explants cultured in vitro modified the
biological activity triggered by Fgf10 from chemotactic (bud formation) to proliferative
(cyst-like structure).

The activity of the rMc-Sca1Pos cells is impacted by obesity and gender
In the context of lung fibrosis, the accumulation of activated MYF producing extracellular
matrix components, modify the lung structure and negatively impact gas exchange. The LIF
to MYF reversible differentiation switch appears to be a key process in fibrosis formation and
resolution. Moreover, this transition was also shown in vitro in response to hyperoxia, as a
key event in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) [27].

AT2 cells express angiotensin-

converting enzyme II (ACE), a main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [28]. Interestingly, SARSCoV-2 induces the expression of transforming growth factor β (TGF- β) [29], which has been
described to trigger the LIF to activated MYF transition. Such transition can be reversed by
the administration of a PPARγ agonist (Rosiglitazone) as well as by the antidiabetic drug
metformin [1,2]. Interestingly, metabolic dysregulation such as the one observed in obese
patients has been associated with a worst prognostic in case of COVID-19. A similar

conclusion has been reached for the gender as well as for the age. Interestingly, we can detect
the impact of obesity, gender on the functionality of the rMC-Sca1Pos cells to sustain AT2
stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Our findings open the way for the future to screen
for drugs capable of restoring the niche capabilities.
