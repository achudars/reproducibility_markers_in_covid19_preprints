ABSTRACT
The potential emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) escape mutants is a threat to reduce the
efficacy of existing vaccines and neutralizing antibody (nAb) therapies. An understanding of the
antibody/S escape mutations landscape is urgently needed to preemptively address this threat. Here
we describe a rapid method to identify escape mutants for nAbs targeting the S receptor binding
site. We identified escape mutants for five nAbs, including three from the public germline class
VH3-53 elicited by natural COVID-19 infection. Escape mutations predominantly mapped to the
periphery of the ACE2 recognition site on the RBD with K417, D420, Y421, F486, and Q493 as
notable hotspots. We provide libraries, methods, and software as an openly available community
resource to accelerate new therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.

MAIN
The type I viral fusion protein Spike (S) is a major antigenic determinant of SARS-CoV-2 and is
the antigen used in all approved COVID-19 vaccines (1–3). Recently, the B.1.1.7 (N501Y; U.K.),
B.1.351 (E484K; South Africa), B.1.427 (L452R; California), and B.1.526 (S477N, E484K; NY)
viral lineages have emerged. All encode single nucleotide substitutions in the S receptor binding
domain (RBD) near recognition site for its cellular target angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) (3–5).
Dozens of studies have reported the structural, epitopic, and functional landscape of nonneutralizing monoclonal antibodies and nAbs targeting trimeric S (6–8). A prophetic
understanding of the mutations on S that could evade antibody recognition would enable
development of better vaccine boosters and monoclonal antibody therapies. Thus, we sought to
develop an S RBD yeast surface display (YSD) platform (Fig. S1) (9), as we hypothesized that
broad identification of SARS-CoV-2 S escape mutants could be found by integrating high
throughput screening platforms with deep sequencing. While a similar platform uses the loss of
nAb binding to identify escape mutants (10, 11), we rationalized that a functional screening assay
that directly measures the ability of a nAb to compete with ACE2 for S RBD binding, would be a
comparatively strong predictor of RBD escapability, as it accounts for mutations in RBD that
would disrupt S binding to ACE2.
We had previously developed an aglycosylated S-RBD YSD platform (S RBD(333-537)-N343Q)
(8) that can bind specifically to ACE2 (Fig. 1a). This S RBD construct has its one native N-linked
glycan removed (N343Q) as the heavy N-linked mannosylation endemic of S. cerevisiae could
hamper anti-S RBD mAb recognition. Cell surface titrations of CR3022 IgG and nAb HKU-91030 IgG yielded apparent dissociation constants comparable to reported in vitro results (6,8) (Fig.
S2). We next tested a panel of eleven additional anti-S RBD mAbs for binding to aglycosylated
RBD (7). Ten of the eleven mAbs recognized aglycosylated S RBD (Fig. 1b). The one panel
member that did not bind, CC6.33, selectively recognizes the S309 epitope on the RBD containing
the N-linked glycan at position 343 (12).
Next, we evaluated the ability of the mAb panel to competitively inhibit ACE2 binding to
aglycosylated S RBD in an assay conceptually similar to the one previously described by Tan et
al. (13). Yeast displaying aglycosylated S RBD was first labeled with a saturating concentration
of a given mAb and then co-incubated with biotinylated ACE2. Six mAbs completely ablated
ACE2 binding, one mAb partially inhibited ACE2, and the remaining four did not prevent ACE2
binding (Fig. 1c). A direct correlation was observed between the previously determined
neutralization potency of the antibody (6, 8) and the fluorescence signal increase in the competition
assay (Fig. 1c). We conclude from these experiments that, excluding the S309 epitope, the
aglycosylated S RBD platform faithfully recapitulates binding interactions of nAbs with S RBD
(7).
Our strategy for identifying potential S RBD escape mutants was as follows. First, we constructed
a saturation mutagenesis library of aglycosylated S RBD containing all possible single missense
and nonsense mutations for the 119 surface exposed positions of the RBD (96% coverage of the
2,380 possible library members; Table S1 contains library coverage statistics) (14). We labeled

yeast displaying these RBD variants with a saturating concentration of nAb and then co-incubated
with a saturating concentration of biotinylated ACE2. We then used fluorescence activated cell
sorting (FACS) to screen for mutants that could bind ACE2, indicating that the RBD mutation
allows for evasion of the nAb while not disrupting the ACE2 interaction critical for cell entry (Fig.
1d, Fig. S3-S4). Importantly, a control with no ACE2 labeling was sorted to set an empirical false
discovery rate (FDR) for putative escape mutant hits (Fig. 1d, Fig. S4). Plasmid DNA from sorted
cells were prepped and deep sequenced. We determined the enrichment ratio (15) for each mutant
in the sorted population relative to a reference population, and then used the control population to
set the FDR (Fig. 1e, Fig S5). We screened five different nAbs identified earlier as having
completely ablated ACE2 binding (CC6.29, CC6.31, CC12.1, CC12.3, CC12.13). In all, we
identified a total of 97 S RBD mutants that can escape recognition by at least one nAb (Table S2).
For all five nAbs, the putative escape mutant hits were localized in specific locations within the S
RBD primary sequence (Fig. 1f, Fig. S6-S10). CC12.1 and CC12.3 belong to the public germline
class VH3-53 (6 ,8, 16) and are representative of the subset of VH3-53 public antibodies with
relatively short CDRH3 lengths (17). Strikingly, these two nAbs share over 90% of the same RBD
escape mutants (Fig. 1g), even though the light chain differs between the nAb. Structural
complexes of antibodies CC12.1 and CC12.3 were previously solved in complex with S RBD (18),
affording a structural basis of individual escape mutants. Escape mutants for both of the VH3-53
nAbs CC12.1 and CC12.3 clustered at the same location on the S RBD mainly peripheral to the
ACE2 binding site (Fig 1h; Fig. S11).
Having identified a number of putative escape mutants from the mutagenesis library screening we
sought to determine how this functional screening correlated with the more conventional
pseudovirus neutralization assay. A panel of MLV-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses were
generated that contained single mutations predicted by the mutagenesis scanning to allow escape
from one of the antibodies screened, as well as several irrelevant control mutations. Antibodies
CC12.1, CC12.3 and CC6.29 were screened against the original SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus as well
as this panel of mutant pseudoviruses in duplicate (Fig. 1i), and the resulting IC50s were compared
to calculate the effect on antibody neutralization potency (Fig. 1j; Fig. S12). Consistent with RBD
mutagenesis library and structural analysis, CC6.29 failed to neutralize F486I, E484K, and T478R
variants. Additionally, K417N, K417T, and D420K hotspot mutants completely escaped
neutralization for both CC12.1 and CC12.3. The only instance we tested where the mutagenesis
scanning data differed from the pseudovirus results was at N501Y that was predicted to confer
escape from CC12.1 and CC12.3 but had no effect on the in vitro neutralization potency. Although
it is unclear why this discrepancy occurred, we note that N501Y significantly increases the affinity
of RBD for ACE2, which could result in ACE2 competing off bound nAb.
Finally, we performed biological replicates where the mutagenesis library corresponding to S RBD
positions 437-537 was separately transformed into yeast and screened against nAbs CC6.29,
CC12.1, and CC12.3. While the overall magnitude of the enrichment ratios were lower than in the
initial experiment, nearly the same set of escape mutants were identified for CC6.29, and escape
mutants originally identified for all nAbs had significantly higher ERs than other variants in the
replicate (p-value range 4.2e-4 to 1.9e-11, one-sided Welch’s t-test) (Fig. S13).
Selected per-position heatmaps, and structural mapping of S RBD escape mutants, are shown in
Fig. 2 for all five nAbs. Closer examination of these datasets reveals key features of the RBD

escape mutant response. CC12.1 and CC12.3 nAbs share over 90% of the same RBD escape
mutants (Fig. 1g), including notable hotspot mutations occurring at K417, D420, Y421, and Q498
(Fig. 2a). Interestingly, multiple aromatic substitutions at Q498 escape recognition for CC12.1 &
CC12.3 even though the antibodies have different light chains and recognition motifs for that
position. Introduction of an aromatic residue at Q498 introduces substantial van der Waals clashes
that are likely unresolved without antibody loop movement. The other VH3-53 nAb tested,
CC12.13, has a 15 amino acid length CDRH3 that likely has a distinct binding mode than that for
CC12.1 and CC12.3 (17). Consistent with this, the CC12.13 escape mutants identified are mostly
different from those for CC12.1/CC12.3 (Fig. S10).
Another nAb screened, CC6.29, has a completely different escape mutant profile compared with
CC12.1/CC12.3. The 15 potential RBD escape mutants for CC6.29 center around the structural
‘knob’ of positions A475, S477, T478, E484, and F486 (Fig. 2b). E484K shared by the B.1.351
and B.1.526 lineages is identified as an escape mutant for this nAb, but the structurally adjacent
S477N mutation newly identified in the B.1.526 lineage does not escape CC6.29 neutralization.
Intriguingly, S477P is identified as an escape mutant for this nAb. F486 shows up as a mutational
hotspot even though that position is involved in the recognition of ACE2. However, a previous
mutational scan of S RBD shows that F486 mutation does not significantly impact ACE2 binding
affinity (10). CC6.31 escape mutants partially overlap with CC6.29 but implicate a different set of
mutants (Fig. 2b). Multiple mutations at Q493 escape CC6.31, including Q493 substitutions to
aromatic positions F/W.
In total, the five nAbs map a partially overlapping surface with the ACE2 binding site that is
primed for antibody escape. In comparison with the binding footprint of ACE2 (Fig. 2c), the escape
mutants almost completely map to the outer binding shell and periphery of the interaction surface,
akin to an O ring circumnavigating the receptor binding site. Out of the identified escape mutants,
residues K417, F486, Q493, N501, and Y505 are located on the ACE2 footprint (Fig. 2c). While
mutations on K417 and F486 do not significantly change the RBD affinity to ACE2, mutations on
N501 can both increase or decrease affinity depending on the substitution. The Y505W mutant
shared by CC6.31, CC12.1, and CC12.3 also increases ACE2 affinity (10).
We puzzled why mutations at D420 were so deleterious to the neutralization potency of the VH353 nAbs given that this residue is on the outer periphery of the binding epitope. To obtain insight
into this question, we performed 100 ns aqueous molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of CC12.1
and CC12.3 in complex with wildtype S RBD and S RBD incorporated with the D420E, D420K,
or the Y421N mutation (see SI for details). In the control simulation with CC12.1, D420 on the
RBD and CDRH2 S56 on CC12.1 form persistent hydrogen bonds, and Y421 on the RBD is tightly
bound within a pocket of CC12.1 residues (Fig. 3a). With the D420E mutation, the increased
length of E420 disrupts its ability to hydrogen bond with S56, requiring it to adopt a bent
conformation (Fig. 3b). This forces Y421 out of the antibody pocket, causing increased
fluctuations in neighboring RBD loops which persist throughout the entire 100 ns production
simulation (Fig. S14a, b). With the D420K mutation, hydrogen bonding with S56 is completely
disrupted, and with the Y421N mutation, N421 is too short to interact with the antibody pocket
(Fig. S14c). Similar escape mechanisms are observed for CC12.3 with all three RBD mutations,
including increased fluctuations at one of the same key sites (K458) on the RBD in response to the
D420E mutation (Fig. S14d, e).

There have been a number of recent approaches to identify specific S escape mutants (summarized
in Table S3) (11, 19–22). A survey of the existing escape mutant literature, along with escape
mutants identified in the present work, allows us to identify the absolute and near-absolute escape
resistant ACE2 receptor binding site (RBS) residues in the context of the original lineage (Fig.
3c). One resistant patch is found around F456/Y473/N487/Y489 while other residues are
discontinuous patches on the remainder of the RBS. We note that many of these same resistant
residues are identical to those from SARS-CoV (Y449, N487, Y489, G496, T500 and G502). The
lack of a contiguous surface at the RBS that is conserved makes it highly unlikely that one could
identify a naïve nAb targeting the RBS that is completely resistant to escape.
A major near-term concern with public health implications are identification of the set of single
nucleotide polymorphisms that encode for escape mutants on the S RBD. A summary of 1nucleotide (nt) escape mutants identified in the present work is shown in Fig. 3d. To our
knowledge, 22/35 (63%) of 1-nt escape mutants identified from this nAb panel have not previously
been identified, including hotspot positions D420 and Y421 that escape recognition by the
abundant VH3-53 nAbs. Other notable residues identified here include S477, Q498, and Y501, as
these positions lie directly on the receptor binding site and all have been shown to slightly increase
binding affinity to ACE2 (10). Mutants E484K and N501Y in currently circulating lineages escape
some but not all of the nAbs on the panel.
We have developed a yeast platform that allows for the rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 S
RBD escape mutants for a given nAb. While other platforms to identify escape mutants have
recently been described, key advantages of the approach presented here includes: (i.) screening by
competitive binding against ACE2 which more precisely mimics how actual viral infection can
still persist despite antibody binding; (ii.) a robust and rigorous hit identification algorithm; (iii.) a
safe working environment, as it does not use live virus; and (iv.) a relatively fast identification, as
the RBD library can be screened against a given nAb and analyzed in under a week. There also
exist drawbacks. First, the present method is limited to mapping escape mutants for anti-S-RBD
nAbs that directly compete with ACE2 for binding. Many nAbs neutralize by targeting S epitopes
across protomers (23) or on the N-terminal domain (24), and a robust platform for S ectodomain
display would enable more comprehensive studies. We attempted to develop a yeast platform for
S ectodomain but were unsuccessful: we screened media composition, expression temperature,
protein orientation (Fig. S15), and mutations (1,909 mutants screened with only two potential hits)
(Data S2-3, Table S1, Fig. S16). Second, the presented assay measures the ability of a given
mutant to escape nAb blockade of ACE2. While from all available data the assay appears to
correlate well in the context of pseudo-virus, each mutation is pleiotropic with unknown fitness
effects beyond escape for a given nAb; the true RBS escape mutants that do not appreciably impede
viral fitness will be a subset of the mutations identified here.
Still, using this method we were able to identify specific failure mechanisms for five different
nAbs. This tool can be easily adapted and contribute to developing the next generation of broadly
neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, as well as suggest mutations to include for the next
generation of vaccines. To that end, it would be interesting to see whether our yeast platform
presented here is robust enough to identify escape mutants from bulk sera from convalescent or
vaccinated individuals.

Figure 1. Identification and validation of SARS-CoV-2 S RBD escape mutants using yeast
screening. a) Cartoon of the yeast display construct S-RBD(333-537)-N343Q. Cytograms show
specific binding in the presence, but not absence, of ACE2-Fc. b) Binding profiles of aglycosylated
S RBD labeled with 10 𝜇g/mL of indicated mAb. Antibodies are color coded according to
neutralization potency (7). c.) Competitive binding between IgG and ACE2 was performed by
labeled yeast displaying aglycosylated S RBD with 10 𝜇g/mL of indicated mAbs followed by
labeling with biotinylated ACE2. d.) Single site saturation mutagenesis S RBD libraries were
sorted by FACS using a competition experiment. The top cytogram shows the cell population
collected for the control population without ACE2 labeling, while the bottom cytogram shows the
cell population enriched in mutations able to bind ACE2 in the presence of a competing IgG. The
specific cytogram shown is for nAb CC12.3 using the S RBD library corresponding to mutations
at positions 437-537. e.) Per-mutation enrichment ratio distributions as a function of average depth
of coverage control (top) and CC12.3 nAb competing experiment (bottom). f.) Heatmap showing
predicted S RBD escape mutants for CC12.3 in blue. White cells are mutations with a p value for
an FDR > 1, while grey cells are mutations not present in the mutational library. S RBD positions
directly involved in binding ACE2 are colored gray. g.) Comparison of enrichment ratios (ER) for
individual hits for CC12.3 vs. CC12.1. Closed circles represent escape mutant hits for both nAbs,
whereas open circlers are escape mutant hits for only one nAb. h.) Solved structure of nAB
CC12.3 in complex with S RBD (PDB ID 7KN6). i.) PSV neutralization curves for CC12.1,
CC12.3 and CC6.29 on SARS-CoV-2 (top) and SARS-CoV-2 E484K (bottom). j.) PSV IC50
analysis for CC12.1, CC12.3 and CC6.29 on different identified mutations.

Figure 2. Sequence determinants and structural basis of S RBD escape mutants. a-c) (left)
Limited per-position heatmap and (right) mutations mapped onto the S RBD-ACE2 structural
complex (PDB ID: 6M0J). For clarity, only positions with two or more escape mutations are
shown with surface colored. Panels are for a) nAbs CC12.1, CC12.3, and CC12.13. Boxes
indicate escape mutants for two or more nAbs, while triangles indicate an escape mutant
identified for just one nAb (top left: CC12.1, bottom right: CC12.3, bottom left: CC12.13) ; b)
CC6.29 and CC6.31 (orange); c) overlay of escape mutants from all nAbs onto the S RBD-ACE2
structural complex.

Figure 3. Mechanistic, structural, and sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 escape mutants. a-b)
Snapshots from MD trajectories showing a.) key interactions in the control simulation of S RBD
in complex with CC12.1, and b.) mechanism of escape of S RBD from CC12.1 due to the D420E
mutation. Images were rendered with Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD (25)), and black dotted
lines indicate persistent hydrogen bonds. c.) S RBS positions are colored by the number of escape
mutants identified to date. RBS residues involving the S RBD-ACE2 structural complex (PDB
ID: 6M0J) are colored by number of escape mutants identified to date. d.) Summary of 1-nt escape
mutants identified in the present study. Lineage column indicates presence of the given mutation
amongst currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, while the observed column refers to an escape
mutant previously identified in literature (11, 19–22). ACE2 binding indicates affinity to ACE2
based on the measurements by Starr et al. (10).
