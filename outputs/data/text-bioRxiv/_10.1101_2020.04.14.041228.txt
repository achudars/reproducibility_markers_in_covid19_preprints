Summary
SARS-COV-2 has recently emerged as a new public health threat. Herein, we report
that the FDA-approved gold drug, auranofin, inhibits SARS-COV-2 replication in
human cells at low micro molar concentration. Treatment of cells with auranofin
resulted in a 95% reduction in the viral RNA at 48 hours after infection. Auranofin
treatment dramatically reduced the expression of SARS-COV-2-induced cytokines in
human cells. These data indicate that auranofin could be a useful drug to limit
SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated lung injury due to its anti-viral, antiinflammatory and anti-ROS properties. Auranofin has a well-known toxicity profile
and is considered safe for human use.

Gold-based compounds have shown promising activity against a wide range of
clinical conditions and microorganism infections. Auranofin, a gold-containing triethyl
phosphine, is an FDA- approved drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis since
1985 (1). It has been investigated for potential therapeutic application in a number of
other diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, HIV/AIDS, parasitic
infections and bacterial infections (1, 2). Recently, auranofin was approved by FDA
for phase II clinical trials for cancer therapy. The mechanism of action of auranofin
involves the inhibition of redox enzymes such as thioredoxin reductase, induction of
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and subsequent activation of the unfolded protein
response (UPR) (2-5). Inhibition of these redox enzymes leads to cellular oxidative
stress and intrinsic apoptosis (6, 7). In addition, auranofin is an anti-inflammatory
drug that reduces cytokines production and stimulate cell-mediated immunity (8).
The dual inhibition of inflammatory pathways and thiol redox enzymes by auranofin
makes it an attractive candidate for cancer therapy and treating microbial infections.

Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped viruses with positive sense, single-stranded
RNA genomes (9). SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is closely
related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) (9, 10). It is
known that ER stress and UPR activation contribute significantly to the viral
replication and pathogenesis during a coronavirus infection (11). Infection with
SARS-COV-1 increases the expression of the ER protein folding chaperons GRP78,
GRP94 and other ER stress related genes to maintain protein folding (12). Cells
overexpressing the SARS-COV spike protein and other viral proteins exhibit high
levels of UPR activation (13, 14). Thus, inhibition of redox enzymes such as

thioredoxin reductase and induction of ER stress by auranofin could significantly
affect SARS-COV-2 protein synthesis (15).

In addition, SARS-COV-2 infection causes acute inflammation and neutrophilia that
leads to a cytokine storm with over expression of TNF-alpha, monocyte
chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (10). The
severe COVID-19 illness represents a devastating inflammatory lung disorder due to
cytokines storm that is associated with multiple organ dysfunction leading to high
mortality (10, 16). Taken together, these studies suggest that auranofin could
mitigate SARS-COV-2 infection and associated lung damage due to its anti-viral,
anti-inflammatory and anti-ROS properties. Auranofin has a well-known toxicity
profile and is considered safe for human use.

We investigated the anti-viral activity of auranofin against SARS-CoV-2 and its effect
on virus-induced inflammation in human cells. We infected Huh7 cells with SARSCoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 2 hours, followed
by the addition of 4 µM of auranofin (17, 18). DMSO (0.1%) was used as control (the
solvent was used to prepare drug stock). Cell culture supernatants and cell lysates
were collected at 24 and 48 hours after infection. Virus RNA copies were measured
by RT-PCR using two separate primers specific for the viral N1 gene and N2 gene
(19, 20). As depicted in Figure 1, treatment of cells with auranofin resulted in a 70%
reduction in the viral RNA in the supernatant compared to the DMSO at 24 hours
after infection. At 48 hours, there was an 85% reduction in the viral RNA in the
supernatant compared to the DMSO. Similarly, the levels of intracellular viral RNA
decreased by 85% at 24 hours and 95% at 48 hours in auranofin-treated cells

compared to the DMSO-treated cells. Both set of primers showed nearly identical
results. Auranofin showed no toxicity against Huh7 cells at the used concentration at
24 and 48 hours.

Figure 1: Auranofin inhibits replication of SARS-COV-2 in human cells. Huh7 cells
were infected with SARS-COV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 2 hours and
treated with 4 µM of auranofin or with 0.1% DMSO. Cell pellets and culture supernatants
were collected at 24 and 48 hours after infection and viral RNA levels were measured by RTPCR using primers and probe targeting the SARS-COV-2 N1 gene and the SARS-COV-2 N2
gene. The results were identical for both set of primers showing dramatic reduction in viral
RNA at both 24 and 48 hours. Data represent the mean±SEM, representing two independent
experiments conducted in duplicate.

To determine the effective concentration of auranofin that inhibits 50% of viral
replication (EC50), we treated SARS-COV-2 infected Huh7 cells with serial dilutions
of auranofin. Supernatants and cell lysates were collected at 48 hours after infection
and viral RNA was quantified by RT-PCR. The data were plotted in graphs using
non-linear regression model (GraphPad software). At 48 hours, there was a dosedependent reduction in viral RNA levels in the auranofin-treated cells. Figure 2
represents the EC50 values of auranofin treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infected
Huh7 cells. Auranofin inhibited virus replication in the infected cells at EC50 of
approximately 1.5 µM.

Figure 2: Dose-dependent reduction in SARS-COV-2 RNA in the auranofin-treated
cells: The SARS-COV-2 infected Huh7 cells were treated with serial dilutions of auranofin.
Viral RNA in the cell pellets and culture supernatants were quantified by RT-PCR using
primers and probe targeting the SARS-COV-2 N1. The data were plotted in graphs using
non-linear regression model (GraphPad software). Auranofin inhibited virus replication in the
infected cells at EC50 of approximately 1.5 µM. Data represent two independent experiments
conducted in duplicate.

To assess the effect of auranofin on inflammatory response during SARS-COV-2
infection, we measured the levels of key cytokines in auranofin and DMSO-treated
cells at 24 and 48 hours after infection (21). SARS-COV-2 infection induces a strong
up-regulation of IL-6, IL-1β, TNFα and NF-kB in Huh7 cells (Figure 3). Treatment
with auranofin dramatically reduced the expression of SARS-COV-2-induced
cytokines in Huh7 cells. SARS-COV-2 infection resulted in a 200-fold increase in the
mRNA expression of IL-6 at 48 hours after infection compared to corresponding
mock-infected cells. In contrast, there was only a 2-fold increase in expression of IL6 in auranofin-treated cells. TNF-α levels increased by 90-fold in the DMSO-treated
cells at 48 hours after infection, but this increase was absent in the auranofin-treated
cells. Similarly, no increase in the expression of IL-1β and NF-kB was observed in
the auranofin-treated cells.

Figure 3: Auranofin treatment dramatically reduced the expression of SARS-COV-2induced cytokines in human cells: mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-1β, TNFα and NF-kB were
determined using qRT-PCR at 24 and 48 hours after infection. The fold change in infected
cells compared to corresponding controls was calculated after normalizing to the GAPDH
gene. Data represent the mean±SEM, representing two independent experiments conducted
in duplicate.

Taken together these results demonstrate that auranofin inhibits replication of
SARS-COV-2 in human cells at low micro molar concentration. We also demonstrate
that auranofin treatment resulted in significant reduction in virus-induced
inflammation. These data indicate that auranofin could be a useful drug to limit
SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated lung injury. Further animal studies are
warranted to evaluate the efficacy of auranofin for the management of SARS-COV-2
associated disease.

Methods
SARS-COV-2 infection and drug treatment:
In this study, we used a novel SARS-COV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) isolated from an
oropharyngeal swab from a patient in Washington, USA (BEI NR-52281). Virus strain
was amplified once in Vero E6 cells and had titers of 5 X 106 plaque-forming units
(PFU)/mL. Huh7 cells (human liver cell line) were grown in DMEM (Gibco)
supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were infected with
SARS-COV-2 or PBS (Mock) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 2 hours (17,
18, 21, 22). Cell were washed twice with PBS and media containing different
concentrations of auranofin (Sigma) or DMSO (Sigma) was added to cells.
Supernatants and cell lysates were harvested at 24 and 48 hours after infection.

Viral RNA quantification:
Virus RNA levels were analyzed in the supernatant and cell lysates by quantitative
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RNA from cell culture
supernatants was extracted using a Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and RNA from cell
lysates was extracted using a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as described previously (20,

(Integrated DNA Technologies). Viral RNA copies were determined after comparison
with a standard curve produced using serial 10-fold dilutions of SARS-COV-2 RNA
(18, 20).

Cytokine analysis:
For mRNA analysis of IL-6, IL-1β, TNFα and NF-kB, cDNA was prepared from RNA
isolated from the cell lysates using a iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA), and qRT-PCR was conducted as described previously (21, 23,
24). The primer sequences used for qRT-PCR are listed in Table 1.
