ABSTRACT

26

C3A is a sub-clone of human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell line with the strong contact inhibition

27

of growth. We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-

28

OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into

29

C3A cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential

30

susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that ADAP2, GILT and

31

LY6E, three cellular proteins with known activity of interfering virus entry, expressed at

32

significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression

33

of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV-OC43. While

34

overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV-

35

OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to

36

HCoV-OC43 infection. Moreover, we found that LY6E also efficiently restricted the entry

37

mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently

38

pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2 or

39

amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the IFITM3 restriction of human coronavirus

40

entry, but did not compromise the effect of LY6E on the entry of human coronaviruses. The

41

work reported herein thus demonstrates that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that

42

controls CoV infection and pathogenesis via a distinct mechanism.

Importance

45

Virus entry into host cells is one of the key determinants of host range and cell tropism and is

46

subjected to the control by host innate and adaptive immune responses. In the last decade,

47

several interferon inducible cellular proteins, including IFITMs, GILT, ADAP2, 25CH and

48

LY6E, had been identified to modulate the infectious entry of a variety of viruses. Particularly,

49

LY6E was recently identified as host factors to facilitate the entry of several human pathogenic

50

viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus and yellow fever virus.

INTRODUCTION

56
57

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses with

58

broad host ranges and tissue tropism (1, 2). While four human CoVs, including HCoV-229E,

59

HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, cause mild upper respiratory tract infections,

60

three zoonotic CoVs have crossed species barriers to infect humans since 2002 and cause severe

61

acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (3, 4), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (5, 6) and

62

coronaviral disease-19 (COVID-19) (7, 8), with the mortality rate of 10%, 30% and 1 to 2%,

63

respectively (9, 10). No vaccine or antiviral drug is currently available to prevent CoV infection

64

or treat the infected individuals. The cross-species transmission of zoonotic CoVs presents a

65

continuous threat to global human health (11, 12). Therefore, understanding the mechanism of

66

CoV infection and pathogenesis is important for the development of vaccines and antiviral

67

agents to control the current COVID-19 pandemics and prevent future zoonotic CoV threats.

68

CoV entry into host cells, a process to deliver viral nucleocapsids cross the plasma

69

membrane barrier into the cytoplasm, is the key determinant of virus host range and plays a

70

critical role in zoonotic CoV cross-species transmission (2, 13). The entry process begins by the

71

binding of viruses to their specific receptor on the plasma membrane, which triggers endocytosis

72

to internalize the viruses into the endocytic vesicles. The cleavage of viral envelope spike

73

proteins by endocytic proteases and/or endosomal acidification triggers the conformation change

74

of spike protein to induce the fusion of viral envelope with endocytic membrane and release

75

nucleocapsids into the cytoplasm to initiate viral protein synthesis and RNA replication. While

76

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the bona fide receptor for SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-

77

2 and HCoV-NL63 (14-16), MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E use dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4)

78

and CD13 (also known as aminopeptidase N) as their receptor, respectively (17, 18). However,

79

HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 bind to 9-Oacetylated sialic acids via a conserved receptor-

80

binding site in spike protein domain A to initiate the infection of target cells (19). As the key

81

determinant of cell tropism, host range, and pathogenesis, CoV entry is primarily controlled by

82

interactions between the spike envelope glycoprotein and host cell receptor as well as the

83

susceptibility of spike glycoprotein to protease cleavage and/or acid-induced activation of

84

membrane fusion (20, 21). For instance, SARS-CoV can use ACE2 orthologs of different animal

85

species as receptors (22-26) and the efficiency of these ACE2 orthologs to mediate SARS-CoV

86

cell entry is consistent with the susceptibility of these animals to SARS-CoV infection (27-30).

87

In addition, expression of endosomal cathepsins, cell surface transmembrane proteases

88

(TMPRSS), furin, and trypsin differentially modulates the entry of different human CoVs (31-

89

35).

90

Interferons (IFNs) are the primary antiviral cytokines that mediate innate and adaptive

91

immune control of virus infection by inducing hundreds of genes, many of which encode

92

antiviral effectors (36). In the last decades, several IFN-inducible proteins, including three IFN-

93

induced

94

lysosome/endosome-localized thiolreductase (GILT) (38), 25-Hydroxycholesterol hydrolase

95

(25HC) (39), ArfGAP with dual pleckstrin homology (PH) domains 2 (ADAP2) (40) and

96

lymphocyte antigen 6 family member E (LY6E) (41) had been identified to restrict or enhance

97

the entry of a variety of viruses. Interestingly, while IFITM proteins inhibit the entry of all the

98

other human CoVs, HCoV-OC43 hijacks human IFITM2 or IFITM3 as entry factors to facilitate

99

its infection of host cells (42, 43). We also demonstrated recently that GILT suppresses the entry

100

of SARS-CoV, but not other human CoVs (38). As reported herein, in our efforts to identify host

transmembrane

(IFITM)

proteins

factor(s) determining the differential susceptibility of two closed related human hepatoma cell

102

lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that LY6E potently suppresses the infectious entry of

103

all the human CoVs, including the currently pandemic SARS-COV-2. Our study also revealed

104

that unlikely IFITMs, LY6E inhibits CoV entry via a distinct mechanism.

RESULTS

107
108

C3A is more susceptible to HCoV-OC43 infection than its parental cell line HepG2. C3A is

109

a sub-clone of HepG2 that was selected for strong contact inhibition of growth and high albumin

110

production (44). Metabolically, C3A is more relevant to normal hepatocytes and has been used

111

for development of bioartificial liver devices (45). Interestingly, we found that these two closely

112

related cell lines drastically differ in their susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection (Fig. 1).

113

Specifically, infection of the two cell lines with the virus at a MOI of 0.02, 0.2 and 1 resulted in

114

approximately 75, 25 and 10 folds more infected cells in C3A cultures than in HepG2 cultures at

115

24 h post infection, respectively (Fig. 1A). Consistent with this finding, much higher levels of

116

viral nucleocapsid protein (N) and RNA were detected in infected C3A cultures (Figs. 1B and C).

117

Infected C3A cultures also produced approximately 20-fold more progeny viruses than HepG2

118

cultures did (Fig. 1D). To determine whether the differential susceptibility of the two hepatoma

119

cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection is due to a difference in virus entry or post-entry replication

120

event, we compared the susceptibility of the two cell lines to lentiviral particles pseudotyped

121

with envelope proteins of HCoV-OC43, influenza A virus (IAV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)

122

or Lassa fever virus (LASV). As shown in Fig 2, while pseudoviral particles of IAV (IAVpp),

123

VSV (VSVpp) and LASV (LASVpp) infected the two cell lines with similar efficiency, the

124

efficiency of HCoV-OC43pp infection in C3A cultures is approximately 50 folds higher than

125

that in HepG2 cultures. These results clearly indicate that the differential susceptibility is

126

attributed to the distinct ability of the two cell lines to support the infectious entry of HCoV-

127

OC43.

128
129

IFITM proteins modulate HCoV-OC43 infection of C3A and HepG2 cells in a similar

130

extent. We reported previously that IFITM proteins differentially modulate HCoV-OC43 entry

131

into target cells. While IFITM1 inhibits the virus entry, IFITM2 and IFITM3 enhance the cellular

132

entry of this virus (42). To investigate whether the differential expression of IFITM proteins in

133

the two cell lines is responsible for their difference in HCoV-OC43 infection efficiency, we

134

examined IFITM protein expression by Western blot assays and found the two hepatoma cell

135

lines expressed similar levels of IFITM1 and IFITM2/3 (Fig. 1B). Because the C-terminal

136

variable regions of IFITM1 and IFITM3 control the inhibition and enhancement of HCoV-OC43

137

entry (42), respectively, we further compared the effects of IFITM1 and C-terminal region

138

exchanged IFITM proteins on the virus infection. As shown in Fig. 3, in spite of their distinct

139

susceptibility, expression of IFITM1-EX2, a mutant IFITM1 protein with its C-terminal domain

140

replaced with the C-terminal domain of IFITM3 (42), and IFITM3-EX2, a mutant IFITM3

141

protein with its C-terminal domain replaced with the C-terminal domain of IFITM1 (42),

142

significantly enhanced and inhibited HCoV-OC43 infection of both cell lines, respectively, as

143

evidenced by the significant changes in infected cell percentage (Fig. 3A), reduced viral

144

nucleocapsid protein expression (Fig. 3B), intracellular RNA accumulation (Fig. 3C) and yields

145

of progeny virus production (Fig. 3D). Moreover, pseudotyped lentiviral infection assay further

146

demonstrated that IFITM1, IFITM1-EX2 and IFITM3-EX2 modulated HCoV-OC43 envelope

147

proteins mediated entry in a similar extent in the two cell lines (Fig. 3E). Accordingly, we

148

concluded that IFITM proteins were not responsible for the observed differential susceptibility of

149

the two hepatoma cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection.

150
151

LY6E inhibits the entry mediated by human CoV envelope spike proteins and is

152

responsible for the differential susceptibility of C3A and HepG2 cells to HCoV-OC43

153

infection. In order to identify host cellular proteins that may enhance HCoV-OC43 infection of

154

C3A cells or suppress the virus entry into HepG2 cells, we first compared the expression of

155

several cellular genes with known activity to restrict or enhance virus entry into target cells. As

156

shown in Fig. 4A, we found that ADAP2, GILT and LY6E mRNA expressed at significantly

157

higher levels in HepG2 cells. While the expression of ADAP2 and GILT did not inhibit HCoV-

158

OC43pp infection (Fig. 4B), expression of LY6E in Flp-In TREx 293 cells efficiently suppressed

159

the infection of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of all the human

160

CoVs including SARS-CoV-2, except for SARS-CoV (Fig. 4C and 4D). In addition, LY6E

161

enhanced the infection of IAVpp (Fig. 4D). In agreement with our previous report, expression of

162

GILT inhibited SARS-CoVpp infection (38). To further confirm the role of LY6E in HCoV-

163

OC43 infection, we showed that ectopic expression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells

164

significantly reduced their susceptibility to the virus infection, whereas reducing the expression

165

of LY6E in HepG2 cells by shRNA knockdown significantly increased HCoV-OC43 infection

166

(Fig. 5). The results presented above imply that LY6E is a restriction factor for human CoVs and

167

responsible for the differential susceptibility of C3A and HepG2 cells to HCoV-OC43 infection.

169

LY6E restriction of human coronavirus entry depends on GPI-anchor and the

170

evolutionally conserved L36 residue. LY6E is a member of the LY6/uPAR superfamily. Like

171

most LY6 family members, LY6E contains ten cysteines that form a highly conserved, three-

172

finger folding motif through disulfide bonding and localizes on the plasma membrane of cells via

173

glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring. LY6E is ubiquitously expressed in many cell

174

types and functions in modulation of cell signal transduction (41). Recent studies revealed that

175

human LY6E promotes the entry of HIV (46, 47) and multiple enveloped RNA viruses from

176

several viral families (48). Moreover, the enhancement of RNA viral infection is a conserved

177

function of all the mammalian LY6E orthologs examined thus far. Particularly, substitution of

178

the evolutionally conserved residue L36 with alanine (A) completely abolished the viral

179

enhancement activity of LY6E (48). Interestingly, we found that L36A substitution also

180

abolished the activity of LY6E to restrict the entry of human CoVs (Fig. 6). As anticipated,

181

N99A substitution that disrupts the addition of GPI anchor also abrogated the inhibitory effects

182

of LY6E on human CoV entry (Fig. 6). These results indicate that proper interaction of LY6E

183

with other viral/cellular components via the conserved residue L36 and localization in the

184

specific cell membrane microdomians are required for LY6E restriction of human CoV entry.

185
186

Activation of CoV entry by TMPRSS2 expression fails to evade LY6E restriction of CoV

187

entry. It was reported by others and us that expression of cell membrane associated serine

188

protease TMPRSS2 enhances SARS-CoV and SARS-like bat CoV entry (32-34). More

189

importantly, the TMPRSS2-enhanced entry can evade IFITM3 restriction (Mei Zheng, et al,

190

manuscript under review), presumably because the cellular protease activates the viral fusion at

191

cell surface or early endosomes where IFITM3 expression at a relatively lower levels and thus

192

fails to inhibit viral fusion. To determine the effects of TMPRSS2 expression on LY6E

193

restriction of human CoV entry, Flp-In TREx 293-derived cell line expressing LY6E were

194

transfected with a control vector (pCAGGS) or a plasmid expressing human TMPRSS2 and

195

cultured in the absence or presence of tetracycline (tet) for 24 h. The cells were then infected

196

with the indicated pseudotyped lentiviruses. As shown in Fig. 7A, in absence of tet to induce

197

LY6E, expression of TMPRSS2 significantly enhanced the infection of SARS-CoVpp, MERS-

198

CoVpp and HCoV-229Epp, but not the infection of other human CoVpp and LASVpp.

199

Interestingly, LY6E significantly inhibited the infection of MERS-CoVpp and HCoV-229Epp in

200

the cells without or with ectopic expression of TMPRSS2. Moreover, LY6E failed to inhibit

201

SARS-CoVpp infection in the absence of TMPRSS2 expression, but significantly inhibited

202

SARS-CoVpp infection in the cells expressing TMPRSS2 (Fig. 7B). Therefore, unlikely IFITM3,

203

expression of TMPRSS2 cannot evade LY6E restriction of human CoV entry. Instead, LY6E

204

restriction of the entry of human CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV, is regulated by the expression

205

of cellular proteases that previously known to activate the fusion activity of viral spike proteins.

206
207

Amphotericin B treatment does not compromise LY6E restriction of human CoV entry.

208

Amphotericin B (AmphoB) is antifungal medicine that binds with ergosterol in fungal cell

209

membranes, forming pores that cause rapid leakage of monovalent ions and subsequent fungal

210

cell death. AmphoB can also bind to cholesterol in mammalian cell membrane, albeit at a lesser

211

affinity than to fungal ergosterol (49). The cholesterol-enriched plasma membrane microdomains

212

known as lipid rafts play important roles in the entry and egress of many enveloped viruses (50,

213

51). Particularly, AmphoB treatment had been shown to significantly compromise IFITM

214

restriction of IAV entry (52) and attenuate IFITM enhancement of HCoV-OC43 infection (42).

215

In this study, we further demonstrated that AmphoB treatment also efficiently attenuated the

216

restriction of IFITM3 on the infection of SARS-CoVpp, MERS-CoVpp, HCoV-NL63pp, HCoV-

217

229Epp and IAVpp, but not LASVpp (Fig. 8A). However, AmphoB treatment altered neither the

218

restriction activity of LY6E on the infection of human CoV spike protein-pseudotyped

219

lentiviruses nor the enhancement of LY6E on IAVpp infection (Fig. 8B). These results strongly

220

imply that LY6E modulates virus entry via a distinct mechanism.

221
222

DISCUSSION

223
224

LY6E was initially identified as a cell surface marker to discriminate immature from

225

mature thymocytes subsets (53). The primary function of LY6E has been associated with

226

immune regulation, specifically in modulating T cell activation, proliferation, development (54).

227

In addition to lymphocytes, LY6E mRNA can also be detected in liver, spleen, uterus, ovary,

228

lung, and brain and its expression can be induced by type I IFN in a cell-type specific manner

229

(53). However, LY6E is not a typical antiviral effector protein. Instead, LY6E was reported to

230

promote the infection of enveloped RNA viruses from several viral families (48) and modulates

231

HIV-1 infection in a manner dependent on the level of CD4 expression in target cells (46, 47).

232

Our finding that LY6E restricts human CoV infection and characterization of its antiviral effects

233

shed new lights on the mode of LY6E action on virus entry in general.

234

First, either the enhancement or restriction of LY6E on virus entry depends on its GPI

235

anchor (Fig. 6) (46-48). GPI-anchored proteins are preferentially located in lipid rafts, the plasma

236

membrane microdomains enriched in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol as well as protein

237

receptors or ligands. Lipid rafts are considered to compartmentalize membrane processes by

11

238

facilitating the interaction of protein receptors and their ligands/effectors to modulate membrane

239

functions, such as signal transduction, membrane fusion, vesicle budding and trafficking. Lipid

240

rafts also involve in the entry and egress of many viruses. For instance, both HIV-1 receptor

241

(CD4) and coreceptors are localized in lipid rafts. Yu and colleagues elegantly demonstrated

242

recently that LY6E enhances HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells and monocytic THP1- cells by

243

promoting the expansion of viral fusion pore induced by HIV-1 Env (47). Furthermore, LY6E

244

was found to be the receptor of mouse endogenous retroviral envelope Syncytin-A and

245

interaction of LY6E with Syncytin-A induces the syncytiotrophoblast fusion and placental

246

morphogenesis (55, 56). However, Mar and colleagues showed that LY6E enhances IAV

247

infection of cells by promoting a viral replication step after viral nucleocapsid escape from

248

endosomes, but before viral RNP nuclear translocation, i.e., most likely the uncoating of

249

nucleocapsids (48). Interestingly, the results presented in Fig. 4 indicate that LY6E significantly

250

enhanced the infection of IAVpp, suggesting that the LY6E enhancement of IAV infection is, at

251

least in part, through promoting the entry into target cells, possibly also by enhancing viral

252

fusion. Considering the broad inhibitory effects of LY6E on human CoVs and its fusogenic or

253

fusion-modulating activity, we speculate that LY6E might inhibit the membrane fusion triggered

254

by CoV spike proteins. However, the role of LY6E on endocytosis and endocytic vesicle

255

trafficking cannot be ruled out. These hypotheses are currently under investigation.

256

Second, in addition to GPI anchor, the evolutionally conserved amino acid residue L36 is

257

also required for both the enhancement and restriction of virus entry into target cells by LY6E

258

(Fig. 6) (48). It can be speculated that this specific residue may mediate an interaction with other

259

cellular membrane proteins to module viral entry. The fact that LY6E enhances viral infectivity

260

in a cell type-specific manner, with the strongest phenotype in cells of fibroblast and monocytic

261

lineages (48), does indicate the involvement of other host cellular factors. Variations in the

262

abundance of expression, as well as the localization of LY6E and its associated proteins or lipids,

263

may explain the differential effects of LY6E on the infection of different viruses in different cell

264

types (Fig. 4 and 7). However, LY6E enhancement of RNA virus infection appears to be

265

independent of type I interferon response and other ISG expression (48). Particularly,

266

enhancement of viral infection in Huh7.5 cells that do not have basal levels of IFITM protein

267

expression indicates that LY6E enhancement of RNA viral infection is most likely not through

268

modulating the function of IFITM proteins (42). This notion is further supported by the finding

269

that LY6E and Syncitin-A mediated syncytiotrophoblast fusion can be inhibited by IFITM

270

proteins (57, 58).

271

Third, studying the effects of LY6E on HIV-1 infection of CD4 low-expressing cells,

272

such as Jurkat T cells and primary monocyte-derived macrophages, revealed that HIV-1 entry

273

was inhibited by LY6E (46). This appears due to the LY6E-induced reduction of lipid raft-

274

associated CD4 on the surface of these cells. It was demonstrated that LY6E can promote CD4

275

endocytosis and mobilize lipid raft-associated CD4 molecules to non-raft microdomains. Such a

276

receptor down-regulation significantly reduced HIV-1 binding and infection of CD4 low-

277

expressing cells (macrophages), but did not significantly impact the binding of HIV-1 to CD4

278

high-expressing cells, which allows for LY6E to predominantly enhance HIV-1 infection of

279

CD4+ T lymphocytes by promotion of membrane fusion (46). It is, therefore, possible that LY6E

280

inhibition of human CoV infection is due to the down-regulation of lipid raft-associated CoV

281

receptors. However, the differential effects of LY6E on the infection of SARS-CoVpp, SARS-

282

CoV-2pp and HCoV-NL63pp, that share the ACE2 receptor, does not support such a hypothesis

283

(Fig. 4).

284

Finally, the findings that LY6E inhibits human CoV entry cannot be evaded by ectopic

285

expression of membrane-associated serine protease TMPRSS2 and compromised by AmphoB

286

treatment strongly indicate that LY6E modulates virus entry via a distinct mechanism from that

287

IFITM proteins do (Figs. 7 and 8). Specifically, inhibition of TMPESS2-enhanced CoV entry

288

implies that LY6E most likely blocks virus entry at plasma membrane or in early endosomes.

289

Moreover, IFITMs impede viral fusion by decreasing membrane fluidity and curvature (37).

290

AmphoB can bind cholesterol in cell membranes to increase membrane fluidity and planarity and

291

consequentially rescue IFITM inhibition of virus entry (52). Interestingly, AmphoB only

292

neutralize the antiviral effects of IFITM2 and IFITM3, but has little effect on IFITM1 restriction

293

of virus entry (52). While IFITM1 is predominantly located in the plasma membrane or early

294

endosomes, IFITM2 and 3 are mainly localized in the later endosomes and lysosomes. Due to

295

their differential subcellular localization, IFITM1 mainly restricts the viruses that enter the cells

296

at cell surface or in the early endosomes, such as parainfluenza viruses and hepatitis C virus (59,

297

60), IFITM2 and 3 primarily restrict the infection of viruses that enter the cells at later

298

endosomes and/or lysosomes (43, 61, 62). Because AmphoB is endocytosed quite rapidly

299

leading to its concentration in the late endosomes and lysosomes, it more efficiently alleviates

300

the effect of IFITM2 and 3, but not IFITM1, on virus entry (52). Similarly, the failure of

301

AmphoB to attenuate the antiviral effects of LY6E against human CoVs is most likely due to its

302

predominant cell surface localization and inhibition of an early step of CoV entry.

303

In summary, while it is very interesting to know that LY6E is capable of modulating the

304

entry of many RNA viruses, we only begin to uncover the mechanism of this fascinating host

305

factor and define its pathobiological role in virus infection (41, 63). Further understanding the

Package of pseudotyped retroviral particles. The various viral envelope protein pseudotyped

356

lentiviruses bearing luciferase reporter gene as well as VSV G protein pseudotyped Moloney

357

murine leukemia virus (MMLV)-derived retroviral vectors (pQCXIP) expressing wild-type and

360

pseudotype was titrated by infection of cells with a serial dilution of pseudotype preparations.

361

The modulation of IFITM or LY6E on the transduction of a given pseudotype was determined

362

with a titrated amount of pseudotypes that yield luciferase signal between 10,000 to 1,000,000

363

light units per well of 96-well plates (69, 72). For a given pseudotype, the input of pseudoviral

364

particles is consistent across all the experiments.

366

Establishment of cell lines stably expressing wild-type and mutant IFITM or LY6E

367

proteins or shRNA. HepG2, C3A or A549 cells in each well of 6-well plates were incubated

368

with 2 ml of Opti-MEM medium containing pseudotyped retroviruses and centrifuged at 20 °C

369

for 30 minutes at 4,000×g. Forty-eight hours post transduction, cells were cultured with media

370

containing 2 µg/ml of puromycin for two weeks. The antibiotic resistant cells were pooled and

371

expanded into cell lines stably expressing wild-type or mutant IFITM or LY6E proteins or

372

shRNA targeting LY6E. Flp-In TREx 293-derived cell lines expressing IFITM, GILT, ADAP2

373

or LY6E proteins in a tetracycline (tet) inducible manner were established as previously

374

Fig. 4. LY6E efficiently suppresses human coronavirus spike protein-mediated entry. (A)
Levels of Ly6E, GILT and ADAP2 mRNA expression in HepG2 and C3A cells were determined
by qRT-PCR assays and normalized to the level of GAPDH. (B) Flp-In T-Rex 293-derived cell
lines expressing control protein CAT, GILT or ADAP2 were cultured in the absence or presence
of tet for 24 h. The cells were infected with HCoV-OC43pp and other indicated pseudoviral
particles and intracellular luciferase activity were determined at 48 hpi. Relative infection is the
ratio of luciferase activity in the same cells cultured in the presence of tet over that in the absence
of tet. The error bars refer to standard deviations (n=4). (C) Flp-In T-Rex 293-derived cell line
expressing a control protein CAT or LY6E were cultured in the absence or presence of tet. Cells

was detected by a Western blot assay. β-actin served as a loading control. (D) Flp-In T-Rex 293derived cell lines expressing LY6E were cultured in the absence or presence of tet for 24 h. The
cells were then infected with lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the envelope protein of the
indicated viruses. Luciferase activities were determined at 48 hpi. Relative infection is the ratio
of luciferase activity in the same cells cultured in the presence of tet over that in the absence of
tet. The error bars refer to standard deviations (n=4). **, p <0.001 compared to the control cells
expressing CAT.

Fig. 5 LY6E inhibits HCoV-OC43 infection in human hepatoma (HepG2 and C3A) and
lung cancer (A549) cells. (A) HepG2 cells were stably transduced with scramble shRNA or
shRNA targeting LY6E mRNA. The level of intracellular LY6E expression was determined by
Western blot using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against LY6E. β-actin served as a loading
control. (B) HepG2 cells stably expressing the scramble shRNA or LY6E specific shRNA were
infected with HCoV-OC43 at an MOI of 1.0. Cells were harvested at 24 hpi and intracellular
viral RNA was quantified by qRT-PCR assay and presented as copies per 100 ng total RNA.
Error bars indicate standard deviations (n = 4). (C to F) C3A or A549 cells were stably
transduced with an empty retroviral vector (pQCXIP) or retroviral vector expressing LY6E and
infected with HCoV-OC43 at the indicated MOI. The expression of LY6E in the cell lines was
confirmed by a western blot assay. β-actin served as a loading control (C and E). The cells were
fixed at 24 hpi. The infected cells were visualized by IF staining of HCoV-OC43 N protein (red).
Cell nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining (D and F).

Fig. 6. Identification of critical structure motifs essential for LY6E to restrict human
coronavirus entry. (A) The amino acid sequence alignment of LY6E from multiple vertebrate
species is conducted and “three finger-fold” structure is highlighted with black box. The
conserved L36 as well as GPI anchor and N99 glycosylation sites are indicated (B) Flp-In T-Rex
293-derived cell lines expressing a control protein CAT, wild-type or mutant LY6E were
cultured in the absence or presence of tet for 24 h. Intracellular LY6E expression were detected
by a Western blot assay. β-actin served as a loading control. (C) Flp-In T-Rex 293-derived cell
lines expressing the wild-type or mutant LY6E were cultured in the absence or presence of tet for
24 h. The cells were then infected with the indicated pseudotyped lentivirus. Luciferase activities
were measured at 48hpi. Relative infection is the ratio of luciferase activity in the same cells
cultured in the presence of tet over that in the absence of tet. The error bars refer to standard
deviations (n=4).

Fig. 7. LY6E inhibits TMPRSS2 enhanced entry of human coronaviruses. Flp-In T-Rex 293derived cell line expressing LY6E were transfected with a control vector (pCAGGS) or a
plasmid expressing human TMPRSS2 and cultured in the absence or presence of tet for 24 h.
The cells were then infected with the indicated pseudotyped lentivirus. Luciferase activities were
measured at 48hpi. (A) The effect of TMPRSS2 expression on pseudotyped virus infection is
normalized to infection efficiency of the cells transfected with control vector plasmid (set as 1).
Error bars indicate the standard deviation (n=4). (B) Relative infection refers to the ratio of the
luciferase activity in the cells cultured in the presence of tet over that in the cells cultured in the
absence of tet. Error bars indicate the standard deviation (n=4). **, p <0.001, comparing to cells
transfected with pCAGGS vector.
