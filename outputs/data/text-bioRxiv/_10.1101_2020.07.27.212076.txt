ABSTRACT

49
50

The distal lung contains terminal bronchioles and alveoli that facilitate gas exchange and is affected by

51

disorders including interstitial lung disease, cancer, and SARS-CoV-2-associated COVID-19

52

pneumonia. Investigations of these localized pathologies have been hindered by a lack of 3D in vitro

53

human distal lung culture systems. Further, human distal lung stem cell identification has been impaired

54

by quiescence, anatomic divergence from mouse and lack of lineage tracing and clonogenic culture.

55

Here, we developed robust feeder-free, chemically-defined culture of distal human lung progenitors as

56

organoids derived clonally from single adult human alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) or KRT5+ basal

57

cells. AT2 organoids exhibited AT1 transdifferentiation potential, while basal cell organoids

58

progressively developed lumens lined by differentiated club and ciliated cells. Organoids consisting

59

solely of club cells were not observed. Upon single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), alveolar

60

organoids were composed of proliferative AT2 cells; however, basal organoid KRT5+ cells contained a

61

distinct ITGA6+ITGB4+ mitotic population whose proliferation segregated to a TNFRSF12Ahi

62

subfraction. Clonogenic organoid growth was markedly enriched within the TNFRSF12Ahi subset of

63

FACS-purified ITGA6+ITGB4+ basal cells from human lung or derivative organoids. In vivo,

64

TNFRSF12A+ cells comprised ~10% of KRT5+ basal cells and resided in clusters within terminal

65

bronchioles. To model COVID-19 distal lung disease, we everted the polarity of basal and alveolar

66

organoids to rapidly relocate differentiated club and ciliated cells from the organoid lumen to the exterior

67

surface, thus displaying the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 on the outwardly-facing apical aspect.

68

Accordingly, basal and AT2 “apical-out” organoids were infected by SARS-CoV-2, identifying club

69

cells as a novel target population. This long-term, feeder-free organoid culture of human distal lung

70

alveolar and basal stem cells, coupled with single cell analysis, identifies unsuspected basal cell

71

functional heterogeneity and exemplifies progenitor identification within a slowly proliferating human

72

tissue. Further, our studies establish a facile in vitro organoid model for human distal lung infectious

73

diseases including COVID-19-associated pneumonia.

INTRODUCTION

76
77

The distal lung, including terminal bronchioles and alveoli, performs essential gas exchange functions

78

which can be significantly compromised by disease. For example, SARS-CoV-2 infection can elicit

79

severe distal lung COVID-19 pathology with life-threatening pneumonia and respiratory failure1-3. The

80

limited understanding of COVID-19 pneumonia pathogenesis during a worldwide pandemic has

81

highlighted a pressing need for robust in vitro culture systems allowing study of distal lung pathologies

82

in primary human cells.

83

The lack of long-term human distal lung culture systems has precluded functional testing of the

84

proliferative capacity of putative human distal lung stem cell populations, which are therefore largely

85

inferred from mouse studies. In mouse, lineage-tracing has enabled in vivo confirmation and mapping

86

of ‘bifunctional’ distal lung stem cells that constitutively execute both physiologic and regenerative

87

functions, namely secretory club cells in distal bronchioles4,5 and surfactant-producing alveolar epithelial

88

type II (AT2) cells in alveoli6,7. Injury-inducible murine lung populations include an alveolar progenitor

89

that renews AT1 and AT2 cells8, and distal airway basal cell-like9-11 or bronchioalveolar12,13 progenitors

90

with airway and alveolar differentiation potential. Whether the human correlates of these mouse stem

91

cells are functional in renewing mature lung cell lineages is largely unknown.

92

The cell type composition of human terminal airways differs substantially from mouse. In the human

93

lung basal cells span the entire airway axis14, while in mouse they are absent from the terminal

94

bronchioles where club cells renew and repair the epithelium15,16. Long-term culture of human tracheal

95

and bronchial basal cells have demonstrated stem cell potential, and these are also presumed to function

96

as stem cells for lower airway renewal17-23. Human AT2 cell cultures have also been reported but are

97

short-lived6,18,24,25, and the long-term self-renewal capacity of human AT2 cells thus remains unknown.

98

Furthermore, existing AT2 cell culture protocols achieve only minimal expansion and require feeder cells

99

producing unknown factors, limiting their biological characterization and screening utility. Directed

100

differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to AT2 cells can be limited by efficiency, feeder

101

dependence and persistent fetal gene expression, suggesting immaturity26-29. Here, we established long-

102

term, feeder-free, chemically-defined 3D organoid culture of distal human lung, including AT2 and basal

103

stem cells, and applied this method to progenitor identification and SARS-CoV-2 modeling.

104
105

Human adult distal lung culture yields clonogenic alveolar and basal cell organoids

106

We empirically established defined media conditions supporting clonal expansion of distal human lung

107

progenitors, encompassing bronchiolar and alveolar cells. To exclude proximal cell types, we used only

108

the peripheral one centimeter of lung underlying the mesothelium, which was devoid of cartilage (Fig.

109

1a). Single cell suspensions from 134 individuals (Supplementary Table 1), were cultured within a

110

droplet of collagen/laminin extracellular matrix without exogenous feeder cells. We surveyed growth

111

factors whose cognate pathways including WNT, EGF and BMP have been implicated in lung

112

development and disease pathogenesis14,22. The combination of EGF and the BMP antagonist NOGGIN

113

was optimal, without any additional growth-promoting effects of either WNT3A or R-SPONDIN1

114

(RSPO1) (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Single cells underwent clonal expansion into one of two distinct

115

organoid morphologies. Cystic organoids (Fig. 1a,b) were SFTPC+HT2-280+ and lacked KRT5,

116

indicating AT2 cell identity (Fig. 1d-g). In contrast, solid organoids (Fig 1a,c) expressed the basal cell

117

marker KRT5 and lacked SFPTC indicating basal cell identity (Fig. 1d, h-j). Organoids consisting solely

118

of SCGB1A1+ club cells were not observed (Fig. 1d).

119

To stringently exclude the possibility that contaminating stromal cells could be contributing

120

unknown growth factors, we generated distal lung organoids from >99.9% EPCAM+ starting populations

121

by magnetic bead depletion of fibroblasts, endothelial and hematopoietic cells followed by FACS

122

purification of EPCAM+ cells, which confirmed organoid generation with only EGF and NOGGIN

123

provision (Fig. 1k-m). Distal lung organoids could be passaged for ~6 months with basal organoids

124

initially exhibiting 6-7 doublings every 2 weeks. Alveolar organoids expanded more slowly with an

125

initial rate of 3-4 doublings/2 weeks but predominated over basal organoids after several months. Based

126

on initial cell division rates , the upper limits of basal and alveolar expansion were 219 (524,288 fold) and

127

216 (65,536 fold) respectively. Organoids arose clonally as confirmed by (1) time-lapse microscopy of

128

single cells (Fig. 1b,c) and (2) color mixing studies of disaggregated, lentivirally-transduced GFP+ or

129

mCherry+ cells that generated entirely red or green but not chimeric organoids (Fig. 1n-p).

130

Single cell RNA-sequencing of distal lung organoids confirmed distinct SFTPC+ AT2, KRT5+ basal

131

and SCGB1A1+ club cell populations. Cells co-expressing KRT5 and SCGB1A1 bridged the basal and

132

club cell populations, suggesting molecular intermediates transitioning from basal into club cells (Fig.

133

1q-v, Extended Data Fig. 2). Trajectory analysis using SPADE30,31 projected a cellular differentiation

134

path from basal to club cell identity but not between AT2 and club or AT2 and basal cells (Extended

135

Data Fig. 3, Supplementary Data 1).

136
137

Human AT2 cells extensively renew and maintain AT1 cell transdifferentiation capacity

138

We further refined these methods to generate pure clonogenically-derived AT2 organoids. Viable AT2

139

cells were purified from mixed distal lung organoids without accompanying stromal populations using

140

fluorescence-associated cell sorting (FACS), exploiting lamellar body uptake of the lysosomal dye

141

LysoTracker32 in EPCAM+ cells (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 1c-d, Extended Data Fig. 4a,

142

Supplementary Data 2). Individual EPCAM+LysoTracker+ AT2 cells progressively expanded as cystic

143

organoids up to 180 days, exhibiting a mixture of cuboidal or more flattened morphologies reminiscent

144

of alveoli (Fig. 2b,c). Qualitatively identical results were obtained with anti-HTII-280 (AT2 marker)

145

purification instead of LysoTracker. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed a basal surface

146

contacting surrounding matrix, characteristic apical microvilli, and abundant cytoplasmic lamellar

147

bodies, characteristic of fully mature and functional AT2 cells (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 4b). AT2

148

organoids expressed HTII-280 (Fig. 2e) and occasionally assumed an AT1-like flattened morphology

149

with variable downregulation of AT2 cell type markers but without AT1 marker expression (data not

150

shown). However, upon culture on a glass surface with fetal bovine serum which promotes the AT1

151

phenotype7,33, AT2 cells rapidly flattened, downregulated HTII-280 and initiated AT1 HTI-56 marker

152

expression, indicating retention of differentiation capacity after expansion (Fig. 2f). EGF and NOGGIN

153

were sufficient for clonal AT2 organoid proliferation and exogenous WNT-3A and RSPONDIN-1 did

154

not enhance growth. However, the PORCUPINE inhibitor C59, which blocks endogenous WNT

155

biosynthesis, attenuated AT2 organoid growth (Fig. 2g), suggesting essential autocrine WNT signaling

156

and recapitulating mouse AT2 cell biology34. Lastly, isolated AT2 cells exhibited clonal organoid growth

157

in lentivirus GFP/mCherry mixing studies, with 0/797 organoids demonstrating chimerism (Fig. 2h).

158

Single cell RNA-seq of mixed distal lung organoids revealed uniformly high-level expression of

159

canonical AT2 cell markers such as SFTPC within the alveolar populations (Fig. 1q-t, Extended Data

160

Fig. 2). These data did not readily identify AT2 cell subsets within organoids, although the relatively

161

low number of AT2 cells limited sensitivity (Extended Data Fig. 2, Extended Data Fig. 5a-c). We thus

162

generated clonally derived pure alveolar organoids by culturing FACS-isolated EPCAM+Lysotracker+

163

cells from mixed distal lung organoids (Fig. 2i). Analysis of 2,780 single cells from purified alveolar

164

organoids at culture day 89 (60 days post-FACS purification) re-demonstrated homogeneous AT2 marker

165

expression including SFTPA1, SFTPB and SFTPC without basal, club, or AT1 markers (Fig. 2i,

166

Supplementary Data 3-4). Importantly, cell cycle mRNAs such as PCNA and CDK1 were expressed

167

by a minority of AT2 cells but did not cluster to a specific population (Fig. 2i) and a proliferative sub-

168

cluster within AT2 organoids having distinct gene expression unrelated to cell cycle status was not

169

detected (Extended Data Fig. 5d-h, Supplementary Data 4).

170
171

Spontaneous differentiation of human distal airway basal cell-derived organoids

172

Basal cell organoids in mixed distal lung culture initially formed solid KRT5+ masses (Fig. 1a, c-d).

173

However, by ~ 1 month, approximately 50% stochastically developed single but occasionally multiple

174

lumens; this lumen formation did not result from apoptosis (Fig. 2j, Extended Data Fig. 1e-g). Lumen

175

appearance coincided strongly with the emergence of differentiated acetylated tubulin+ (AcTUB+)

176

ciliated cells and SCGB1A1+ club cells at the lumenal surface. Conversely, the basal stem cell marker

177

KRT5 was specifically excluded from the differentiated lumen zone, but was otherwise diffusely

178

expressed (Fig. 2j,k).

179

We further established pure basal cell cultures by using density sedimentation to remove cystic AT2

180

organoids, leaving behind solid basal organoids which were then disaggregated and regrown from single

181

cell suspensions. After 2-4 weeks in culture post-sedimentation, proliferating basal cell organoids again

182

progressively cavitated (Extended Data Fig. 1h-i) with appearance of luminal SCGB1A1+ club and

183

AcTUB+ ciliated cells either upon organoid culture (Fig. 2l,m, Supplementary Video 1-2) or conversion

184

of 3D organoids to 2D air-liquid interface monolayers (Fig. 2n). Clonal outgrowth of basal cell-derived

185

organoids was confirmed by density sedimentation followed by FACS isolation and culture of EPCAM+

186

cells and culture which exhibited monoclonality in lentivirus GFP/mCherry mixing studies with only

187

2/845 chimeric organoids (Fig. 2o). Under these conditions EGF and Noggin were again sufficient for

188

maximal growth without additive effects of WNT3A, R-SPONDIN1. Unlike AT2 organoids, growth

189

was not significantly inhibited by the PORCUPINE inhibitor C59 (Extended Data Fig. 1j).

190
191

Organoid scRNA-seq reveals two molecularly distinct subtypes of human distal airway basal cells

192

In contrast to the homogeneity of organoid AT2 cells, scRNA-seq clustering of KRT5+ basal cells from

193

multiple individuals reproducibly identified two subpopulations, designated Basal 1 and Basal 2 (Fig 3a-

194

b, Extended Data Fig. 6). Basal 1 was enriched for differentiation and cell fate determinants such as

195

HES1 and ID1 and included an actively cycling subpopulation expressing proliferation markers PCNA

196

and CDK1 with significantly overrepresented GSEA cell cycle processes (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig.

197

7a-b, Supplementary Data 4). Basal 1 but not Basal 2 included canonical lung basal cell mRNAs such

198

as integrin a6 (ITGA6) and TP6316, as well as integrin b4 (ITGB4) which is a binding partner for integrin

199

a635 and also expressed in murine Lineage Negative Epithelial Progenitors (LNEPs)9 (Fig. 3c). Basal

200

2, while lacking the above Basal 1 proliferative and cell fate markers, was enriched in vesicular transport,

201

endoplasmic reticulum housekeeping processes and squamous markers; these transcripts were also

202

present in Basal 1, albeit at lower levels (Supplementary Data 4).

TNFRSF12A marks an organoid basal cell subpopulation with enriched progenitor activity

205

We next examined the membrane receptor TNFRSF12A (Fn14, TweakR), one of the most differentially

expressed genes in the Basal 1 cluster (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Table 2), because of its potential utility

207

for FACS sorting and since a related TNF superfamily membrane receptor gene family member,

208

TNFRSF19, marks gastric and intestinal stem cells36,37. Indeed, TNFRSF12A mRNA was enriched in

209

EPCAM+ITGA6+ITGB4+ Basal 1 versus Basal 2 cells (Fig. 3d). In scRNA-seq, Basal 1

210

EPCAM+ITGA6+ITGB4+ cells could be divided into TNFRSF12A-low, -medium and -high mRNA-

211

expressing fractions, and notably a proliferative gene module38 was significantly enriched in the highest

212

(TNFRSF12Ahi) versus lowest quartile (TNFRSF12Alo) subsets (Fig. 3d). Crucially, low, medium and

213

high expression of the Basal 1 transcripts ITGA6 or TP63, or KRT5 did not enrich for this proliferative

214

signature, indicating particular discriminatory utility of TNFRSF12A mRNA levels (Fig. 3d, Extended

215

Data Fig. 7c). To functionally validate this observation, we fractionated total distal lung organoids by

216

anti-TNFRSF12A monoclonal antibody FACS into EPCAM+ITGA6+ITGB4+ cells and then into

217

TNFRSF12Ahi and TNFRSF12Aneg subsets. The incidence of TNFRSF12Ahi cells declined with time

218

to comprise a minority of EPCAM+ITGA6+ITGB4+ cells in late stage differentiating cultures (Fig. 3e).

219

Notably, organoid-derived TNFRSF12Ahi basal cells reproducibly exhibited 4-12x greater clonogenic

220

organoid-forming capacity than TNFRSF12Aneg cells in 5 out of 5 individuals (Fig. 3f,g) in parallel with

221

>60-fold enrichment of TNFRSF12A mRNA in the former (Supplementary Data 2).

222

Possible lineage relationships between Basal 1 and Basal 2 were examined by FACS purification

223

followed by clonogenic culture. Density sedimentation-purified KRT5+ basal organoids (Fig. 2l-n) were

224

fractionated into EPCAM+ITGA6+ITGB4+TNFRSF12Ahi (Basal 1) and EPCAM+ITGA6-ITGB4-

225

TNFRSF12Aneg (Basal 2) populations (Extended Data Fig. 8a).

226

KRT5 expression in both fractions (Extended Data Fig. 8b) clonogenic organoid formation was strongly

227

enriched in Basal 1 versus Basal 2 from three separate individuals (Extended Data Fig. 8c-d), indicating

228

the lack of Basal 1 cell generation by Basal 2 cells. Basal 2-enriched loci SPRR1B and TMSB4X (Fig.

229

3b, Supplementary Data 4) were transiently induced in organoids from FACS-isolated TNFRSF12Ahi

230

Basal 1 cells (Extended Data Fig. 8e-f), indicating Basal 2 differentiation from Basal 1. SPADE

231

trajectory analysis also demonstrated Basal 2 cells emanating from TNFRSF12A+ basal cells,

232

independently supporting a one-way lineage route from Basal 1 to Basal 2 (Extended Data Fig. 3).

Despite essentially homogeneous

233

The NOTCH target gene HES1 was one of the most differentially upregulated Basal 1 genes, and

234

Basal 1-upregulated gene networks included NOTCH1, NOTCH2 and JAG1 (Fig. 3b, Supplementary

235

Data 4). In basal organoids from FACS-purified TNFRSF12AhiEPCAM+ITGA6+ITGB4+ cells, NOTCH

236

inhibition by the gamma-secretase inhibitor DBZ or the extracellular domain of the DLL4 E12 mutant39

237

significantly increased proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 8g-h), suggesting NOTCH restrains growth.

238

NOTCH inhibition by DBZ or DLL4 E12 NOTCH signaling also stimulated incomplete alveolar

240

production (data not shown), mirroring the effect of Notch on mouse LNEP stem cells9. Conversely,

241

NOTCH agonism by JAG1 peptide did not affect proliferation but induced SCGB1A1, similar to reports

242

in upper airway cells40-42 (Extended Data Fig. 8i).

243
244

TNFRSF12A+ basal cells cluster within distal airways in vivo and exhibit enhanced clonogenic

245

potential

246

To demonstrate the TNFRSF12A-expressing basal subpopulation in vivo we performed TNFRSF12A

247

antibody43 staining of freshly fixed intact human distal lung specimens. KRT5 and/or p63 marked

248

essentially all distal airway basal cells, but TNFRSF12A strikingly labeled a cell subset localized in

249

sporadic clusters within the basal layer (Fig. 4a-c). KRT5+TNFRSF12A+ basal cells frequently, but not

250

exclusively, resided at tips or bases of bronchiolar furrows, the latter a previously recognized niche for

251

goblet cells44. TNFRSF12A was not restricted to the basal layer and was detected in diverse lung stromal

252

and epithelial cells, yet clearly marked a minor population of KRT5+/p63+ basal cells (Fig. 4a-c). The

253

TNFRSF12A-expressing subset of KRT5+ basal cells exhibited a higher mitotic index than total KRT5+

254

cells in vivo, consistent with enriched proliferative capacity in vitro (Fig. 4d-e). FACS analysis of freshly

255

dissociated human lung confirmed TNFRSF12A expression in 10.9% of KRT5+ basal cells (Fig. 4f, top).

from human distal lung cultures were avidly infected by a recombinant influenza H1N1 PR8 strain

274

expressing GFP upon viral replication46 (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Data 5) and viral genomic RNA

275

accumulated in mixed organoid culture supernatants over a 96 hr time course (Fig. 5b), similar to

276

previous reports with human lung airway organoids21. Organoids also stained with lectins binding a2-3

277

and a2-6 sialic acid residues (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b), indicating functional influenza receptors as in

278

intact human lung47. Pretreatment of lung organoids with zanamivir, which selectively targets influenza

279

release from infected cells, did not inhibit H1N1 viral infection or replication, as shown by the lack of

280

GFP attenuation. In contrast, the nucleoside analog 2'fluoro 2'deoxycytidine (FdC), which impairs

281

replication across many virus families, was efficacious with EC50 consistent with previous reports48

282

(Extended Data Fig. 9c). Screening of diverse antiviral compound classes in H1N1-infected organoids

283

in a 48-well format assay, quantified by GFP, revealed differential effectiveness (Extended Data Fig.

284

9d), suggesting utility for scalable therapeutics discovery.

285

The COVID-19 pandemic is particularly significant for distal lung disease, where involvement

286

of alveoli and terminal bronchioles elicits life-threatening pneumonia and respiratory failure1-3. SARS-

287

CoV-2 infects intestinal organoids49-51, and 2D ALI monolayer cultures from upper airway, trachea and

288

alveoli50,52 but efficient infection of distal lung tissue has not been demonstrated. In mixed distal lung

289

organoids, scRNA-seq (Fig. 1q,r) revealed mRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and the

290

processing protease TMPRSS2 predominantly in club and AT2 cells (Fig. 5c), consistent with ACE2

291

expression in KRT5- differentiated lumenal cells (Fig. 2j). The present long-term 3D basal and alveolar

292

organoids are typically oriented with the basolateral surface oriented outwards, i.e. facing the

293

extracellular matrix substratum, which could hinder SARS-CoV-2 infection of the apical ACE2-

294

expressing luminal surface. We previously described rapid inversion of apical-basolateral polarity of

295

gastrointestinal organoids by removal from the extracellular matrix gel and growth in suspension,

296

robustly generating organoids with their apical surfaces oriented outward (apical-out), and thus greatly

297

facilitating host-pathogen interactions on the lumenal surface53. We adapted this method to distal lung

298

organoids where suspension culture rapidly induced apical-out polarization and differentiation. Within

299

48 h non-polarized KRT5+ organoids reorganized into apical-out epithelial spheroids with microvilli,

300

apical junctions, and some motile cilia facing the organoid exterior. Within 5 days, differentiation of

301

outwardly oriented ciliated cells continued to accelerate and was progressive over weeks (Fig. 5d;

302

Extended Data Fig. 10a-c; Supplemental Movie 3). Additionally, everted organoids displayed

303

outwardly facing club cells with apical secretory granules (Fig. 5d; Extended Data Fig. 10d); delayed

304

appearance of AT1 cells was also observed in alveolar organoids (Extended Data Fig. 10e-g). In apical-

305

out organoids in suspension culture, ACE2 was detected on the apical membrane of cells on the external

306

organoid surface (Fig. 5e) versus restricted to the internal differentiated apical lumen in basal organoids

307

maintained in ECM (Fig. 2j).

308

Notably, SARS-CoV-2 readily infected apical-out mixed distal lung organoids. SARS-CoV-2

309

genomic RNA was detected at 72 h post-infection by qPCR at levels similar to the abundantly expressed

310

ubiquitous U3 snoRNA (Fig. 5f, left). Infection was further confirmed by the presence of replication-

311

specific SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) (Fig. 5f, right) and by production of infectious virions

312

capable of plaque formation on VeroE6 cells: 35 PFU/ml from cellular lysates and 65 PFU/ml from

313

cellular supernatants. Immunofluorescence visualization of SARS-CoV-2-infected basal organoids

314

revealed the sequential appearance of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by 48h, reflecting viral genome

315

replication (Fig. 5g), and of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) by 96h (Fig. 5h).

316

examined which organoid cell types were infected by SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Approximately 10% of AT2

317

organoids exhibited evidence of infection with prominent localization of SARS-CoV-2 NP within

318

SFTPC-expressing cells (Fig. 5i). Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 infected ~10% of basal organoids. Since basal

319

organoids contain multiple cell types, immunostaining of dsRNA or SARS-CoV2-2 NP was overlaid

320

with either KRT5, SCGB1A1, or AcTUB to determine infected cell identity. In 2,621 total cells

321

representing cultures from 4 individuals (Supplementary Data 7), SARS-CoV-2 infection was not

322

detected in KRT5+ basal or AcTUB+ ciliated cells (odds ratio 0, p-value < 0.05), in contrast to prior

323

studies in 2D ALI culture where SARS-CoV-2 infected upper airway ciliated cells50,52. However, SARS-

324

CoV-2 NP and dsRNA immunofluorescence signals were primarily present in SCGB1A1+ club cells

325

(Fig. 5j-k) which were strongly associated with and accounted for 79% of NP/dsRNA-positive cells

326

(odds ratio 19.33, p < 0.0001); 21% of infected cells lacked SCGB1A1 (Fig. 5j-k, Supplementary Data

327

7). Overall, these studies indicated direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of AT2 cells, and implicated club cells

328

as a novel target population.

DISCUSSION

331
332

The slow cellular turnover of adult lung epithelium has hampered identification of regional stem cell

333

populations. Lack of long-term culture systems and substantial differences between mouse and human

334

lung have particularly impaired validation of human distal lung stem cells. Here, we described a robust,

335

feeder-free, chemically defined method for long-term human distal lung airway and alveolar clonogenic

336

organoid growth, which was applied to progenitor discovery and infectious disease modeling.

337

Basal cells perform crucial stem cell functions in lung and other tissues. Although lung

338

molecular40,54-57 and histochemical56,58 basal cell subsets have been reported and differential progenitor

339

activity has been observed in mouse40,54, proximal human airway studies suggest uniform basal cell

340

proliferative activity in vivo59. We identified two interrelated molecular subtypes of KRT5+ human distal

341

lung basal cells, Basal 1 and Basal 2; although we cannot exclude squamatization in the latter,

342

proliferation selectively localized to the former. Notably, a TNFRSF12Ahi fraction within the Basal 1

343

subset, by both mRNA and protein criteria, possessed enriched clonogenic progenitor activity,

344

establishing functional precedent for a proliferation-enriched basal cell subtype. TNFRSF12A+ basal

345

cells often but not exclusively localized to bases and tips of airway furrows, possibly representing a

346

distinct airway progenitor niche, as proposed for goblet cells44. Conceivably, TNFRSF12A or other

347

markers could distinguish analogous human basal cell progenitor subsets in other tissues.

348

The differentiation of iPSC to lung epithelial lineages, while efficacious, can be constrained by

349

efficiency, feeder dependence, and fetal gene expression26-29, necessitating methods to expand resident

350

adult lung stem cells. Prior human lung basal cell cultures (nasal cavity, trachea, proximal bronchi)

351

achieved in vitro proliferation and clonal expansion16,60, ciliated and mucous differentiation16,41,60 and

352

reconstitution of denuded rat tracheal epithelium58 but have been limited by short term culture, feeder

353

dependence, and restriction to upper airway17,18. Further, intrinsic differences in basal cells and their

354

differentiated progeny along the lung proximal-distal axis may limit generalizability of upper airway

355

studies to distal airways and alveoli14. Our distal airway basal organoids represent amongst the most

356

significant clonal expansion of basal cells from any region of the human lung14,23,24,60.

357

Culture of human adult AT2 cells has been characteristically short-lived and feeder-

358

dependent6,18,24,25.

359

alveolar organoid cultures uniformly expressed the canonical AT2 genes SFPTA1/B/C, possessed

360

characteristic lamellar bodies, functionally required autocrine WNT signaling25,34, and transdifferentiated

361

to AT1 cells upon culture on glass or in suspension. Variable AT2 subpopulations were marked by LYZ

362

or MUC5B (Extended Data Fig. 5-6), previously identified in mouse and implicated in Idiopathic

The present clonogenic, long-term, feeder-free and chemically defined human

363

Pulmonary Fibrosis, respectively61-63. Murine lung progenitors with airway and alveolar epithelial

364

differentiation capacity include LNEPs9,64, Distal Airway Stem Cells (DASCs)10 and Bronchioalveolar

365

Stem Cells (BASCs)9,10,12,65. We did not observe clonal organoids simultaneously containing both

366

mature airway and alveolar cell types but cannot exclude such bipotential progenitors upon different

367

culture conditions.

368

We also describe a facile model for SARS-CoV-2 infection of distal lung, as relevant for COVID-

369

19-associated pneumonia and ARDS1-3. Intestinal organoids recapitulate SARS-CoV-2 infection49-51,

370

2D ALI monolayer cultures from upper airway/trachea organoids are infected by SARS-CoV-250 and a

371

comprehensive study of 2D ALI cultures over the entire proximal-distal airway axis revealed a

372

descending susceptibility gradient52. However, these studies neither employed 3D lung organoid systems

373

nor demonstrated efficient infection of distal lung tissue.

374

mechanically sheared to allow apical SARS-CoV-2 infection50. In contrast, we describe robust SARS-

375

CoV-2 infection by everting distal lung organoids in suspension, rapidly creating physiologically relevant

376

“apical-out” cultures that facilitate direct infection of the ACE2-expressing exterior apical surface that

377

recapitulates in vivo physiology. Active SARS-CoV-2 infection of basal and AT2 organoids was

378

evidenced by detection of spliced subgenomic viral RNA, dsRNA replication intermediates, viral

379

nucleocapsid protein and infectious virus production. In addition to AT2 organoid infection, our results

380

implicate SCGB1A1+ club cells as a novel SARS-CoV-2 distal lung target whose infection could

381

compromise protective lung protective glycosaminoglycans, thus facilitating a vicious COVID-19

382

infection cycle. Although we did not observe ciliated cell infection, SCGB1A1-negative populations

383

were also infected and are under further investigation; for example, bronchial transient secretory cells

384

express ACE2 and TMPRSS266. Since SARS-CoV-2 infects cultured upper airway ciliated cells in

385

vitro50,52, cognate distal lung ciliated cells could be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 or their infection

386

facilitated by alternative culture conditions. These studies extend our prior pathogen investigations in

387

apical-out GI organoids53, and the strong induction of functional ciliogenesis in apical-out suspension

388

conditions may allow improved expansion of ciliated cells versus current 2D ALI monolayer protocols.

389

Overall, single cell analysis of organoid cultures, as exemplified here, may represent a general

390

strategy for human stem cell investigation in slowly proliferating tissues. The culture of progenitors for

391

all adult distal lung epithelial lineages, including alveoli, should substantially enable human pulmonary

392

disease modeling including neoplastic and interstitial lung diseases 67,68 and allow tissue engineering and

393

precision medicine applications. Finally, this organoid system should facilitate general mechanistic and

394

therapeutic investigations of pulmonary pathogens, including the SARS-CoV-2 distal lung infection

395

associated with fulminant respiratory failure.

METHODS
Human tissue procurement and processing
All material used in this work was approved by the Stanford School of Medicine’s Institutional Review
Board and performed under protocol #28908. Standard informed consent for research was obtained in
writing prior to tissue procurement. Peripheral lung tissue within 1 cm of the visceral pleura was obtained
from surgical discards from lobectomies. For patients with suspected lung cancer, cases with clinical T4
(American Joint Cancer Committee 6th edition) disease (e.g. features such as bronchial invasion or
parenchymal satellite nodule/ metastases) were not used. Normal tissue was harvested from the lung
margin most anatomically distal to palpably well-defined lesions, or from uninvolved lobes in the case
of pneumonectomies. Samples with tumors containing ill-defined margins were deferred. Tissue was
either processed fresh or placed at 4°C overnight and processed the following morning.
Organoid culture
To isolate distal airway cells, lung parenchyma 1 cm from the visceral pleura was mechanically
dissociated with Castro scissors, washed and incubated with 5 Units/ml porcine elastase (Worthington),
100 Kunitz Units/ml DNase I (Worthington), and Normocin (InvivoGen) resuspended in two tissue
volumes of lung organoid media, comprised of Advanced DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with
10 mM nicotinamide, n-acetyl cysteine, 1X B27 supplement minus vitamin A, recombinant human
NOGGIN (100 ng/ml, R&D Systems), recombinant human EGF (50 ng/ml, R&D Systems), and TGFbeta inhibitor A83-01 (100nM, Tocris). The tissue was then agitated for one hour at 37C and the resultant
cell suspension was filtered through 100 through 40 µm cell strainers and subjected to ammonium
chloride red blood cell lysis. The cell pellet was then washed and resuspended in 10 volumes of reduced
growth factor Basement Membrane Extract II (Trevigen). Cells in matrix were then plated in 24-well
plates in 50 microliter droplets, and warm media was added after the droplets solidified for ten minutes
at room temperature Media was changed every 3-4 days and organoids were passaged every 3-4 weeks
by dissociation with TrypLE. Passaging was based on ECM durability/integrity and estimated organoid
confluency, judged by estimated organoid volume to volume of the ECM droplet. To rule out
contamination by malignant cells, long-term cultures were systematically evaluated for the presence of
dysplasia or carcinoma by a board-certified pathologist. In addition, five long-term organoid cultures (26 months) underwent targeted Next Generation Sequencing to detect the presence of pathogenic variants
(see below). Full details are provided in Supplementary Methods.
Tandem MACS stromal depletion and EPCAM purification of distal lung cells
Distal lung was dissociated as above, and all incubation steps were carried out on ice. 107 cells were
incubated with Fc Block (Biolegend 422301) and diluted 1:100 in FACS buffer (2 mM EDTA and 0.2%
fetal calf serum in 1X PBS pH 7.4), for ten minutes followed by APC conjugated anti-CD45 antibodies
at 1 µg/ml in FACS buffer for 30 minutes, washed, and subjected to two rounds of depletion with
magnetic beads according to manufacturer’s protocol (Miltenyi: anti-human fibroblast 130-050-601,
anti-CD31 130-091-935, anti-APC 130-090-855, LS column 130-042-401). Unlabeled cells were then
centrifuged at 300 x g and labeled with a cocktail of 1 μg/ml of PerCP-Cy5.5 anti-EPCAM antibody and
Zombie Aqua viability stain (Biolegend 423101) diluted 1:400 from stock concentration in FACS buffer.
Organoid Cryopreservation and Recovery
For cryopreservation and recovery, ECM droplets were dissociated by pipetting in 3 volumes of PBS
with 5 mM EDTA and then incubated on ice for one hour. Cells were pelleted at 300 x g for 5 minutes
and resuspended in freezing medium (fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 10% v/v DMSO), placed into cryovials
and then into Mr. Frosty™ (Thermo Fisher) containers and stored in a -80C freezer overnight, followed
by transfer to liquid nitrogen vapor phase for long term storage. Organoids were recovered by quick thaw

in a 37C water bath followed by washing in organoid media and plating in ECM with organoid media
plus 10 μM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (Tocris).
Screening exogenous growth factors in organoid culture
Distal airway cells were isolated and plated as above with the following exceptions: ADMEM/F12 was
used instead of organoid medium during elastase digestion of lung tissue, cells were serially diluted and
filtered through a 40 micron cell strainer and counted with a hemocytometer. 1000 viable epithelial cells
(by Trypan blue exclusion, size, and morphology) per μL ECM were plated per 5 μL Matrigel droplet
per well. Base media consisted of organoid media lacking A83-01, EGF, NOGGIN, WNT3A or
RSPO1. EGF (final 50 ng/ml, R&D), NOGGIN (final 100 ng/ml, R&D), WNT3A (final 100 ng/ml,
R&D), RSPO1 (final 500 ng/ml, Peprotech) or the PORCUPINE inhibitor C59 (final 1 µM, Biogems)
were added singly or in combination to base media. Images were obtained ten days after primary plating
with an inverted light microscope at 5X magnification. Each condition was plated in quadruplicate and
organoid formation was quantified using the analyze particle (threshold = 4902 pixels) plugin in ImageJ
as previously described65.
Single Cell RNA-seq of unfractionated organoid cultures
Lung organoid cultures from separate individuals were dissociated 4 weeks after primary plating and
subjected to droplet based scRNA-seq with the 10x Genomics Gemcode Single Cell 3’ platform with a
5 nucleotide UMI according to manufacturer’s protocol. Cell capture, library preparation, and sequencing
were performed as previously described69. Principle Component Analysis, t distributed Stochastic
Neighborhood Embedding, unsupervised Graph based clustering, statistical testing for all scRNA-seq
analyses are described in Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Data 3.
Single cell RNA-seq of purified AT2 organoid cultures
LysoTracker+ AT2 cells from unfractionated organoids were purified by FACS and cultured for two
months with one passage. These were dissociated and subjected to droplet-based scRNA-seq with the
10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3’ platform v2 according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
library was sequenced using paired-end sequencing (26bp Read 1 and 98bp Read 2) with a single sample
index (8bp) on an Illumina NextSeq 500. Data preprocessing and Principle Component Analysis were
carried out with CellRanger v1.2. Subsequent analysis is described in Supplementary Methods and
Supplementary Data 3.
Electron microscopy
Organoid cultures were fixed in ECM with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4),
dehydrated, embedded in epoxy resin and visualized with a JEOL (model JEM1400) transmissionelectron microscope with a LaB6 emitter at 120 kV.
Histology and immunocytochemistry
Organoids were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde at 4 degrees Celsius overnight, paraffin embedded and
sectioned (10-20 μm) as previously described69. Sections were deparaffinized and stained with H&E for
histological analysis. Antibodies used for immunocytochemistry staining are listed in Supplementary
Methods following standard staining protocol as previously described70 and images were acquired on a
Leica-SP8 confocal microscope.
RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization
RNA in situ hybridization was performed according to Nagendran et al.71 and probe sequences are
provided in Supplementary Methods.

Whole mount organoid confocal immunofluorescence microscopy
Intact, uninfected organoids were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH
7.4) (4% paraformaldehyde for infected organoids) for one hour at room temperature, washed with PBS
with 100 mM glycine, permeabilized 0.5% triton X-100 in PBS for one hour, then incubated in staining
buffer (4% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS pH7.4, 10% goat/donkey serum) for an additional hour,
followed by incubation with primary antibody for 24 hours at room temperature in staining buffer. Whole
mounts were then washed with PBS-T and incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies, phalloidin
and DAPI, for four hours at room temperature in staining buffer. Following additional washes, whole
mounts were submerged in mounting media (VECTASHIELD, Vector Laboratories) and mounted on
chambered coverslips for imaging in four channels using Zeiss LSM 700 or 900 confocal microscopes.
3D rendering of confocal image stacks was performed using Volocity Image Analysis software (Quorum
Technologies Inc., Guelph, Ontario). For Figure 5j, requiring 5 colors, cilia were distinguished by
staining with two fluorescent secondary antibodies and merging the colocalized voxels into a
pseudocolored channel using Volocity software. Lectin staining (FITC-Sambuca Nigrin, Vector Labs
FL-1301; Biotin-Maackia Amurensis, Vector Labs FL-1301) was carried out according to
manufacturer’s protocol after fixation of organoids with 0.1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 hour at
room temperature followed by blocking with Avidin/Biotin (Vector Labs SP-2001). Biotin-Maackia
Amurensis lectin was labeled with streptavidin-PE conjugate (Thermo Fisher SA10041) and after
washing lectin staining was imaged in a Keyence BZ-X700.
Next generation sequencing of organoid cultures
Ten organoid cultures were sequenced using a commercial targeted resequencing assay with end-to-end
coverage of 131 cancer genes and companion software (TOMA COMPASS Tumor Mutational Profiling
System, Foster City, CA) to determine the presence of oncogenic mutations in long-term organoid
cultures. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500. Nonsynonymous variants are listed in
Supplementary Table 3. Variant Call Files are provided in Supplementary Data 6.
Density sedimentation of basal cells
Organoid cultures within 2-3 weeks of primary plating were dissociated with 1 U/ml neutral protease
(Worthington, Cat LS02100) and 100 KU of DNase I in organoid media. Basal organoids were then
collected by gravity sedimentation and the supernatant was either aspirated or collected for downstream
use. Basal organoids were then further fractionated on a custom Ficoll-Paque gradient (4 vol Ficoll-Paque
to 1 vol PBS) and centrifuged at 300 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature. The supernatant was
aspirated and the organoid pellet was resuspended in 10 ml PBS in a 15 ml conical tube, collected by
gravity sedimentation, and plated into ECM as described above.
FACS isolation and culture of AT2 cells
Organoids were dissociated with TrypLE followed by neutralization with 10% volume fetal calf serum,
subjected to DNase at 100 kU/ml, washed with organoid media and then incubated with 100 cell pellet
volumes of organoid media with 10 nM LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Thermo Fisher L7528) at 37C for
30 minutes. Cells were then washed and resuspended in FACS buffer as described above, incubated with
Fc block, followed by incubation on ice with labeling cocktail consisting of 1 μg/ml of PerCP-Cy5.5
anti-EPCAM antibody and Zombie Aqua viability stain (Biolegend 423101) diluted 1:400 from stock
concentration in FACS buffer. EPCAMhi and LysoTrackerhi cells were sorted into organoid media with
10 μM Y-27632 (Tocris 1254) and cultured in ECM and media with Y-27632 for 24 hours, followed by
regular media. Full gating strategy is provided in Supplementary Data 2. All FACS antibodies were
purchased from Biolegend.

Color mixing studies with lentivirally transduced GFP and mCherry
FACS EPCAM+ stromal depleted organoids at d14 were infected with lentivirus at an estimated MOI of
0.9 according to Van Lidth de Jeude et al.72 with third generation lentiviral vectors (PGK-GFP T2A Puro,
SBI cat# CD550A-1; mCherry modified from pLentiCRISPRv1 (Addgene #49545) to incorporate an EF1a-mCherry P2A Puro cassette, a gift from Paul Rack). 96 hours after infection, organoids were treated
with puromycin at a concentration of 600 ng/ml for 48 hours to select for transduced cells. Two weeks
after selection, GFP expressing organoids and mCherry expressing organoids were dissociated to single
cells and mixed in a 1:1 ratio and scored as monochromatic or mixed after 28 days of each passage. The
same approach was employed for purified AT2 and basal cultures after respective purification strategies
from an initial FACS EPCAM+ stromal depleted organoid starter culture.
Flow cytometry analysis of resident basal cells from adult human lung
Adult human lung tissue was procured and dissociated as above but cells were labeled with Zombie Aqua
live:dead stain as above, washed with FACS buffer, and then fixed in 2% PFA in PBS overnight at 4C.
Cells were then stained using the whole mount procedure as described above with the omission of PBS
glycine washing. Fixed and permeabilized cells were then incubated with 1:400 dilution of Alexa Fluor
647 conjugated mouse anti-human cytokeratin 5 antibody (Abcam) for 24 hours at 4C in permeabilization
buffer. Cells were then washed with FACS buffer and labeled with PE conjugated mouse anti-human
TNFRSF12A antibody (clone ITEM-4, Biolegend) for 30 minutes on ice, followed by washing and
analysis on a BD Aria Fusion instrument. Full gating strategy and qPCR validation of ITEM-4 antibody
is detailed in Supplementary Data 2.
FACS isolation of TNFRSF12Ahi and TNFRSF12Aneg basal cells
Single cell suspensions from either fresh human distal lung or primary organoid culture at approximately
4 weeks of culture were dissociated as above, treated with Fc Block, and incubated in FACS buffer with
Zombie Aqua 1:400, 1 μg/ml PerCP-Cy5.5 anti-human EpCAM (CD326), 1 ug/ml APC anti-human
ITGA6 (CD49f), 2 ug/ml FITC anti-human ITGB4 (CD104), and 1 μg/ml PE anti-human TNFRSF12A
(CD266). 30 minutes after labeling the cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and sorted for
EPCAMhi, ITGA6/ITGB4hi, TNFRSF12Ahi and TNFRSF12Aneg. Full gating strategy is provided in
Supplementary Data 2. > 5000 cells were sorted into Eppendorf tubes with lung organoid medium and
10 μM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. All FACS antibodies were purchased from Biolegend.
Culture of TNFRSF12Ahi and TNFRSF12Aneg basal cells.
Cells were seeded in ECM and submerged in lung organoid media with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632.
Seeding density for cells FACS isolated from organoid culture was 1000 cells per well at a density of
100 cells/μL of ECM. Seeding for cells FACS isolated from fresh human distal lung was 3000 cells per
well at a density of 300 cells/μL of ECM. After 24 hours, the media was changed to remove ROCK
inhibitor and additionally changed every 72 hours. Organoid formation was manually quantified 14 days
post plating by two independent observers.
NOTCH manipulation in TNFRSF12Ahi basal cells.
TNFRSF12Ahi basal cells were isolated and cultured as above. 24 hours after plating, media was changed
to lung organoid media with either vehicle (0.1% DMSO), 1 μg/ml JAG1 peptide (Anaspec), 500 nM
soluble recombinant NOTCH receptor inhibitor Delta Like Ligand 4 mutant (DLL4E12), or 1 μM gamma
secretase inhibitor DBZ (Tocris). After 14 days of culture, biochemical estimation of proliferation was
carried out by resazurin reduction assay (Alamar Blue, Thermo Fisher) for 16 hours according to
manufacturer’s protocol and resazurin reduction was measured via fluorescence readout on a Biotek
Synergy H1 plate reader according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reference blank consisted of Alamar
Blue reagent incubated in parallel media without cells. Expression and purification of the NOTCH
receptor inhibitor DLL4E12 was performed as previously described39.

H1N1 organoid influenza assay
Unfractionated cultures containing AT2, basal, and club cell types at 2-3 weeks were infected in triplicate
with PR8 strain of H1N1 modified to express GFP upon viral replication46 after 24 hours of pretreatment
with antiviral compounds. ECM was dispersed by addition of 5 mM EDTA in PBS, followed by washing
and inoculation with GFP-reporter virus at an estimated MOI of 1 in media containing either vehicle or
antivirals. After 12 hours (one influenza infection cycle), intact organoid GFP expression was visualized
by either fluorescence microscopy with a Keyence BZ-X700 automated microscope, or dissociated to
single cell, fixed with 0.1% PFA in PBS followed by flow cytometry quantitation of GFP+ cells (Gating
Strategy is provided in Supplementary Data 2). Antiviral dose response curves were generated using
four-parameter nonlinear regression curve fitting with GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA). H1N1 tropism was assessed in a manner similar to above with the exception of Ficoll
sedimented basal cell fraction versus non-basal fractions were dissociated to single cells, counted, and
infected with an estimated MOI of 1 in organoid media for one hour at 37°C, followed by washing and
reseeding into ECM, cultured for 16 hours, followed by dissociation and flow cytometry analysis as
above.
Quantifying H1N1 infection productivity
Productivity of pandemic H1N1 virus infection (A/California/07/2009) was determined by qPCR
according to Zhou et al 21 but with the following modifications. Organoids at 6 weeks of culture were
removed from ECM with 1 U/ml neutral protease, washed with media, and reseeded 1:1 in 24 well plate
wells 10% ECM and organoid media for 24 hours. Virus was added at an estimated MOI of 0.01 and
incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. The supernatant was removed and wells were washed thrice with media
and incubated with 1 ml of media per well. 250 μL aliquots of cell culture supernatant were harvested at
2, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hour time points with an equal volume of media replaced for each aliquot. Virus was
quantified by qPCR according to Krafft et al73.
Suspension culture to generate apical-out polarity in lung organoids
Lung organoids grown embedded in 50µl ECM-droplets were transferred to suspension culture as
described in Co et al53 with some modifications. Briefly, ECM-embedded organoids were dislodged
gently by pipetting using sterile LoBind tips (Eppendorf 22493008) and placed in 15 ml LoBind conical
tubes (Eppendorf 30122216) containing ice-cold 5 mM EDTA in PBS. The ratio of EDTA solution to
ECM and the time of solubilization is important to optimally release intact organoids from the matrix. 5
ml of EDTA solution are used per ECM-droplet (3 ECM droplets/15 ml conical) rotating for 1 h at 4°C
on a rotating platform. Organoids were centrifuged at 200 x g for 3 min at 4°C and the supernatant was
removed. The pellet was re-suspended in growth media in ultra-low attachment 6-well tissue culture
plates (Corning Costar 3471). Suspended organoids were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for different
times (range 0-30 days) to characterize apical-out polarity, ciliogenesis, and differentiation, and to
prepare apical-out organoids for infection experiments with SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV2 infection of human distal lung organoids
VeroE6 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in supplemented DMEM with 10% FBS. SARSCoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) was passaged in VeroE6 cells in DMEM with 2% FBS. Titers were determined
by plaque assay on VeroE6 cells using Avicel (FMC Biopolymer) and crystal violet (Sigma), viral
genome sequence was verified, and all infections were done with passage 3 virus. Organoids were
counted and passaged into suspension media for 6-8 days and then resuspended in virus media or an
equal volume of mock media, at a MOI of 1 relative to total organoid cells in the sample, and then
incubated at 37°C under 5% CO2 for 2 hours. Organoids were then plated in suspension in EN media
(apical-out organoids). At the indicated timepoints, organoids were washed with EN media and PBS and
either resuspended in TRIzol LS (Thermo Fisher), freshly-made 4% PFA in PBS, or 250 μL EN media.
Cells resuspended in EN media were lysed by freezing at -80. Culture supernatants were preserved in

TRIzol LS or added directly to plaque assay monolayers. All SARS-CoV-2 work was performed in a
class II biosafety cabinet under BSL3 conditions at Stanford University.
qPCR analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
RNA from SARS-CoV-2-infected organoids was extracted by adding 750 μl TRIzol (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), incubating at 55 °C for 5 min and then adding 150 μl chloroform. After mixing each sample
by vortexing for 7 s, the samples were incubated at 25 °C for 5 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 r.p.m.
for 15 min at 4 °C. The aqueous layer was carefully removed from each sample, mixed with two volumes
of 100% ethanol and purified using an RNA Clean & Concentrator-25 kit (Zymo Research) as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. All RNA samples were DNase treated with the Turbo DNA-free kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). The Brilliant II SYBR Green QRT-PCR 1-Step Master Mix (VWR) was used to
convert RNA to cDNA and amplify specific RNA regions on the CFX96 Touch real-time PCR detection
system (Bio-Rad). RT reaction was performed for 30 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, followed by twostep qPCR with 95 °C for 10 seconds and 55 °C for 30 seconds, for a total of 40 cycles. Two primer sets
were used, either to amplify non-spliced SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (gRNA) spanning nucleotide
positions 14221-14306, or spliced SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA52. The primer sequences are listed in the
Supplementary Methods.
Quantitation of SCGB1A1 and SFTPC mRNA expression in TNFRSF12Ahi basal cells
FACS-isolated basal cells cultured in the above conditions were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS
for one hour at room temperature, embedded in HistoGel (Thermo Fisher HG-4000-012), dehydrated and
paraffin embedded en bloc. One hundred serial sections were obtained at 10 micron thickness, and
immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization were performed at each 100 micron level. Confocal
images were acquired in a blinded manner and organoids were defined as a cluster of 3 or greater DAPI
nuclei. Channels were acquired using identical parameters for DAPI, Alexa 488 (SFTPC RNA in situ
hybridization), Texas Red (SCGB1A1 RNA in situ hybridization), and Alexa 647 (KRT5
immunostaining). Z-stacks were collected and images were processed in ImageJ and maximum intensity
Z projections were used to quantitate SCGB1A1 and SFTPC RNA in situ in Cell Profiler74 using the RNA
Proximity Ligase Assay counting pipeline (https://github.com/tischi/cellprofiler-practical-NeuBIASLisbon-2017).
TNFRSF12A immunostaining of intact distal lung
Optimal staining of human distal lung tissue was achieved from specimens fixed within 30 minutes of
primary surgical resections in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Specimens were incubated in fixative
overnight at 4°C, transferred to 30% sucrose, and embedded into OCT. 10 μm thick frozen sections were
cut, subjected to citrate based antigen retrieval (Vector labs) at 70°C for 30 minutes, followed by blocking
for one hour with 10% goat serum in IF wash buffer as described above. Mouse anti-TNFRSF12A (clone
ITEM-4, Biolegend) was utilized for (Fig. 4f-i) and polyclonal rabbit anti-TNFRSF12A (ThermoFisher
PA5-20275) was used for Fig. 4a-e, h).
Live-imaging and confocal microscopy of immobilized apical-out lung organoids
Live organoids were held between two coverslips in a viewing chamber (Lab-Tek II two-chambered
coverglass) and filmed using a Nikon TE2000E microscope using differential interference contrast (DIC)
microscopy with a 63X objective. Samples were kept at 37°C with 5% CO2 during imaging. Digital
videos were collected by a Hamamatsu high-resolution ORCA-285 digital camera and rendered using
OpenLab 5.5.2 software (Improvision). After recording, samples were fixed and stained without removal
from the chambers and transferred to the confocal microscope for immunofluorescence microscopy.
Additional experimental details are in Supplementary Methods.
