Abstract

The highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.617 with double mutations E484Q
and L452R in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein is
worrisome. Demonstrated in crystal structures, the residues 452 and 484 in RBD are
not in direct contact with interfacial residues in the angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(ACE2). This suggests that albeit there are some possibly nonlocal effects, the E484Q
and L452R mutations might not significantly affect RBD’s binding with ACE2, which
is an important step for viral entry into host cells. Thus, without the known molecular
mechanism, these two successful mutations (from the point of view of SARS-CoV-2)
can be hypothesized to evade human antibodies. Using in silico all-atom molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation as well as deep learning (DL) approaches, here we show
that these two mutations significantly reduce the binding affinity between RBD and the
antibody LY-CoV555 (also named as Bamlanivimab) that was proven to be efficacious
for neutralizing the wide-type SARS-CoV-2. With the revealed molecular mechanism

Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic has evolved into several new dominant variants with major genomic
changes through mutations. Mutations in viruses arise (partly) as a result of low polymerase
fidelity of viral replication but become a survival mechanism for viruses to adapt to new
hosts and environments. 1 Although the majority of viral mutations are benign with most
of them weeded out immediately, the current pandemic provides a suitable environment for
SARS-CoV-2 to make natural selection of rare-acted but favorable mutations to strengthen
its survival capability. Since the virus surface spike protein plays an important role in mediating SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells and is the target for vaccine and therapeutic
development, any mutations on this region may have biological significance as it could affect the viral infectivity and antigenicity. 2–4 Indeed, experimental studies showed that the
D614G mutation discovered at the earlier stage of the pandemic enhances the virus fitness
and increases its transmission. 5,6 Similarly, the N501Y mutation found in the B.1.1.7, B.1.351
and B.1.1.28.1 variants has been demonstrated to increase the binding affinity between the

receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its human receptor ACE2 (hACE2), making these variants more transmissible. 7–9 Moreover, experimental and computational studies have showed
that the K417N and E484K found in the B.1.351 variant could evade neutralization by many
monoclonal antibodies. 10,11
Recently, a variant named B.1.617 that carries two mutations including the L452R and
E484Q has been designated as variant of interest (VOI) by the World Health Organization
(WHO), suggesting that B.1.617 potentially could have higher transmissibility, severity or
reinfection risk and is required continuous monitoring. In fact, the two mutations found in
B.1.617 are not completely new and have been seen in other variants separately. For example,
the L452R mutation has been spotted in the B.1.427/B.1.429 variant which is known to
be more contagious and is capable of escaping antibody neutralization. 12 Also, the E484Q
mutation is similar to the E484K found in the B.1.351 and B.1.1.28.1. The latter were found
to reduce neutralization by convalescent antisera and binding of some monoclonal antibodies
and increases the binding affinity to the hACE2. 10,11 For the B.1.617 variant, this is the first
time that these two mutations are found to coexist together, therefore it is important to
understand how this variant could evade human antibodies or existing antibody drugs for
treating COVID-19.
Complementary to ongoing experimental efforts, the all-atom molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations with well-calibrated force fields have been widely used to explore the molecular
mechanism of proteins. 13–16 In this work, we carried out an in silico exploration on how a
monoclonal antibody that can neutralize the wide-type SARS-CoV-2 but failed to target
the B.1.617 variant. Here, we focus on the biologics drug LY-CoV555 that is a monoclonal
antibody isolated from a convalescent COVID-19 patient. LY-CoV555 recognizes an epitope
site in the RBD overlapping the binding site of ACE2, and was found to be efficacious
on the wide-type SARS-CoV-2. 17 By combining all-atom molecular dynamics, alchemical
calculations and deep learning (DL) analysis, we aim to unveil the molecular mechanism on
how these two mutations in the variant B.1.617 can be evasive to LY-CoV555. Our results

Results
MD simulations of the complex of RBD and LY-CoV555
Figure 1a illustrates the simulation system for modeling the interaction between LY-CoV555
and RBD (see the Methods section for detailed simulation protocols). According to our
previous simulation of a different complex of RBD and the Fab of the human antibody
CB6, 9,18 the constant domains CH in the heavy chain and CL in the light chain (connected
through disordered coils with their respective variable domains VH and VL ) are not relevant
for studying CB6’s binding with RBD. Thus, in this work, we only include the VH and
VL domains of the Fab of LY-CoV555 in our simulation system, as shown in Fig. 1a. This
complex is very similar to the one in the crystal structure (PDB code: 7K43) showing that
RBD is bound with a Fab fragment (VH and VL ) of the antibody S2M11. 19 Our modeled
complex was solvated in a 0.15 M KCl electrolyte. Hereafter, we simply refer the variable
domains that interact directly with RBD as LY-CoV555. Additionally, we refer the RBD of
the variant B.1.617 as RBD-v.
During the 300 ns or so MD simulation, the complex of RBD and LY-CoV555 starting
from the structure in the crystal environment (PDB code: 7KMG) was properly equilibrated
in the physiology-like environment (a 0.15 M electrolyte). Figure 1b shows the root-meansquare-deviation (RMSD) of all protein-backbone atoms in the complex. After about 50 ns,
the RMSD values saturated at around 1.5 Å for the entire complex, suggesting that not only
the secondary structure of each monomer (RBD, LY-CoV555’s VH or VL ) but also the whole
trimer-structure were very stable.
We further calculated the interfacial contact areas for the complex using the solvent
accessible surface area (SASA) method. 20 By definition, the contact area is calculated by
(SASALY−CoV555 +SASARBD -SASAcomplex )/2. On average, Figure 1c shows that the contact
area is about 8.8 nm2 . During the entire simulation time, values of contact areas fluctuated
around the mean value, corroborating that the complex structure was stable. These results

highlight that LY-CoV555 is an effective neutralizing antibody for the wide-type SARS-CoV2.
To evaluate whether LY-CoV555 is still effective for the variant B.1.617 carrying the
L452R and E484Q mutations, we further investigate interfacial coordinations around L452
and E484. Remarkably, both L452 and E484 play an important role in stabilizing the
interfacial binding, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2a highlights the hydrophobic interactions
between L452 in RBD and I54/L55 in VH of LY-CoV555, while Figure 2b signifies two
interfacial salt-bridges: 1) between E484 in RBD and R50 in VH of LY-CoV555; 2) between
E484 in RBD and R96 in VL of LY-CoV555. These favorable interfacial interactions provide
molecular mechanism on how LY-CoV555 can be stably bound on RBD.
From the analysis of simulation trajectory, we found that the interaction energy between
L452 and I54/L55 is dominated by the van der Waals interactions, which is understandable
because of the hydrophobic nature. Figure 2c shows that during the simulation this interaction reduce the potential energy by 1.2 kcal/mol averagely. In addition, two energy levels can
be discerned in the time-dependent interactions (Figure 2c), resulting from the fact that I54
can temporarily move away from L452 from time to time due to thermal fluctuations. When
both I54 and L55 interacted with L452, the mean interaction energy is about -2 kcal/mol.
However, with only L55 bound with L452, the interaction was weaker and the mean energy
is only about -0.5 kcal/mol (Figure 2c).
To demonstrate that two salt-bridges shown in Figure 2b were stable, we calculated timedependent characteristic distance D, defined as the distance between the CZ atom in R50
(or R96) and the CD atom in E484 (see the inset in Figure 2d). Figure 2d shows that
the time-dependent distances D between R50 and E484 is nearly constant and the average
distance is 4.1 Å. The salt-bridge between R96 and E484 has a different pose (Figure 2b),
leading to a larger average distance of 4.5 Å. Noticeably, the fluctuation in time-dependent
distances is larger for the salt-bridge between R96 and E484 than for salt-bridge between
R50 and E484, suggesting that the former salt-bridge is relatively weaker. Overall, the local

structure formed by E484, R50 and R96 was stable (Movie S1 in Supporting Information,
because these two salt-bridges were actually buried inside the protein complex (Figure S1
in Supporting Information). Note that generally a water-exposed salt-bridge can form and
break frequently and thus their distances can have two different mean values corresponding
to formed and broken states of the salt-bridge. 9

Free energy perturbation calculations for L452R and E484Q mutations
Unfortunately, the importance of L452 and E484 in stabilizing the LY-CoV555’s binding with
RBD as shown above also indicates that L452R and E484Q mutations can be highly evasive
ones for LY-CoV555. Here, we performed free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations 21 to
obtain the binding free energy change (∆∆G) induced by the L452R and E484Q mutations.
As required in FEP calculations, we performed 108-ns-long MD simulations of RBD in a
0.15 M KCl electrolyte (a free state), as shown in Figure S2a in Supporting Information.
Interestingly, the saturated RMSD values for RBD’s backbone atoms are around 2 Å (Figure
S2b in Supporting Information) that is larger than the one (1.5 Å) for the complex, which
is due to the flexible coil (containing E484) in the free state (Movie S2 in Supporting Information). While in the bound state, the same coil is docked at the LY-CoV555’s interface
(see Figure 2b) and thus less flexible. It is worth noting that due to the flexibility of the
above mentioned coil, in the variant B.1.351 the mutated K484 residue can move toward E75
in ACE2 and form a salt-bridge, 9 enhancing the binding affinity. With protein structures
for both bound and free states in respective MD simulations, we applied the FEP alchemy
method to obtain the binding free energy difference for L452R and E484Q mutations on the
RBD. The protocol is briefly described in the Methods section and the detailed one can be
found in previous works. 9
During a typical FEP calculation, the original and new residues gradually disappears and
appears respectively. After the L452R mutation, Figure 3a shows R452 is in contact with

hydrophobic I54 and L55 residues (low dielectric media) in LY-CoV555. However, in the
free state, R452 is surrounded by water/ions (high dielectric media), which suggests that it
is unfavorable for R452 to be at the interface between RBD and LY-CoV555. The rigorous
FEP calculation yielded ∆∆G of 3.04 kcal/mol, corroborating that the L452R mutation is
energetically unfavorable. Our FEP result together with the role of L452 in the interfacial
hydrophobic interaction (Figure 2a) provides theoretical explanations on why mutations of
L452 to charged E, D, R and K residues are highly evasive for LY-CoV555 in experiment. 22
Figure 3b shows that after the E484Q mutation Q484 was away from R96 and formed a
hydrogen bond with R50. Compared with the local coordinations before the E484Q mutation
(Figure 2b), the local interfacial interaction was significantly weakened after the removal of
two salt-bridges that were buried inside the complex and stabilized the entire complex (See
Figure S2 in Supporting Information). Overall, the E484Q mutation yields an extra charge
(+e, where e is the elementary charge) buried inside the low dielectric protein-media, which
is highly unfavorable from the free energy point of view. From the FEP calculation, ∆∆G ∼
22.22 kcal/mol, indicating a much reduced binding affinity between RBD-v and LY-CoV555.
Note that the result of ∆∆G is seemingly large but is consistent with previous result that
the removal of one buried salt-bridge yields ∆∆G of about 10 kcal/mol. 9 Taking all together,
it is concluded that LY-CoV555 cannot bind RBD-v (of the variant B.1.617).
With the revealed molecular mechanism for RBD’s binding with LY-CoV555 and energetics for mutations, it becomes possible to design or engineer a more efficacious antibody drug
targeting the variant B.1.617 specifically. Meanwhile, it is advantageous to stay one-step
ahead of SARA-CoV-2 by considering what other possible mutations can be. Previously, we
conducted an extensive in silico alanine-scan of all interfacial residues of RBD to determine
those key residues that form favorable binding with the antibody CB6. 18 Thus, mutations of
those residues could significantly reduce the binding affinity between RBD and an antibody.
In this work, we employed an efficient DL method (see below) to identify all residues in RBD
that are important for the binding with LY-CoV555.

(3) compressing dimensions of the dynamism tensors with CVAE onto the latent space; (4)
performing HDBSCAN clustering on the latent space for residue i. Finally, RMSD clustering

CASTELO identifies L452 and E484 among the most beneficial residues
in RBD while interacting with LY-CoV555
In previous works, 23,24 we demonstrated that our designed MD-ML workflow CASTELO was
able to identify atoms or atom groups (including amino acid residues) that contributed positively and negatively to the two-body interactions (such as drug-protein interactions 23 and
peptide-protein interactions 24 ), agreeing with both experimental measurements and computationally expensive free energy calculations. Here, we applied the same workflow to the MD
simulation for the complex of RBD and LY-CoV555. With the simulation trajectory, we first
used RMSD clustering method to determine whether the simulation contained a stable binding structure between RBD and LY-CoV555. As shown in Figure 4A, with RMSD clustering
method we identified that the largest cluster of the trajectory lasted ∼169 ns far longer than
the threshold of structural stability used previously (50 ns), 23,24 which suggests that the simulation used in this study contains a stable binding structure of RBD and LY-CoV555. It
is worth mentioning that this is an important first step. As we showed previously, the identification of beneficial or malicious residues relies on the comparison between the clustering
results of the overall structures and the clustering of the individual residues. If the overall
structures (the interfacial residues in this case) are stable, low similarity between the clusters
of the stable overall trajectory and the clusters of an individual residue would mean that
the individual residue is unstable. Residues such as these would be identified as ones that
harm the interactions (which we call the malicious residues). On the contrary, high similarity
between the clusters of the stable overall trajectory and the clusters of an individual residue
would mean that the individual residue is stable. Residues such as these would be identified
as ones that benefit the interactions (which we call the beneficial residues). However, if the
overall structures are unstable, two problems would occur. First, in the simulations where
no stable binding structures are verified, the confidence of finding the actual binding state is
generally low. Therefore, predictions based on these simulations might be less meaningful.
Second, comparison metrics (i.e. dv scores) may not differentiate between unstable residues

and stable residues when the overall structure is unstable. In summary, verifying that our
simulation contains a stable binding structure of RBD-LY-CoV555 is the prerequisite of the
subsequent CASTELO analysis.
We then calculated the contact matrix and dynamism tensor (see Methods) at every time
frame t of the simulation (showing examples in Figure 4A). In order to find the clusters for
individual residues, we used CVAE and HDBSCAN (see Methods section) on the calculated
dynamism tensor at all time frames. Then, we utilize RMSD clustering results (using the
interfacial residues) calculated above and CVAE clustering results calculated with dynamism
tensors of the individual residues to evaluate the CASTELO scores for each of the interfacial
residues (see Methods). The scores are plotted in Figure 4B, showing that L492, N450, L452
and E484 in RBD are among the four most beneficial residues to the complex of RBD and LYCoV555 interactions. Intriguingly, from our MD simulation trajectory we found that L492
and L452 in RBD share close contacts with L55 of V H chain, which indicates an important
hydrophobic core at the complex interface. Thus, similar to the L452R mutation, the possible
L492R mutation can also reduce the LY-CoV555’s binding with RBD. N450 of RBD is
physically close to this hydrophobic core, while sharing hydrogen bond through a water chain
with S30 of V H . Thus, the mutation N450I (occurred with a single nucleotide variation in
their codon codes ) can disrupt this interfacial hydrophilic interaction and weaken the LYCoV555’s binding with RBD. E484 of RBD, on the other hand, seems to stabilize the binding
with a completely different mechanism by forming salt-bridges with R50 of V H and R96 of
V L , as pointed out before. In addition, it is worth highlighting that CASTELO identified
four other beneficial residues S494, Q493, F490 and V483 (Figure 4b) whose mutations were
proven to be evasive for LY-CoV555 in experiment. 22
In contrast, R346, F486, N487 and I472 are among the four most malicious residues to
the interactions between RBD and LY-CoV555. R346 of RBD was picked out, because it
was highly flexible when being completely solvated in the electrolyte. Normally one should
ignore a pick like this because it facilitates the solvation of the protein, even though this

residue might be categorized as an interfacial residue by conventional standards. F486 of
RBD forms an imperfect π − π stacking with slightly hydrophilic Y92 of V H in LY-CoV555,
while being close to hydrophilic N487. As a result, N487 of RBD becomes unfavorable as
well and was identified by CASTELO as a malicious residue. Finally, the hydrophobic I472
of RBD interestingly contacted with the highly hydrophilic E484-R50 and E484-R96 salt
bridges. As a result, it was picked as an unstable residue by CASTELO. Therefore, any
mutation among these four might increase the binding affinity between LY-CoV555 and
RBD, which can be catastrophic for the viral survival in a host.

Discussion and Conclusions
In this in silico study, we assumed that LY-CoV555 targets RBD-v at the same epitope,
which leads to our conclusion that based on FEP calculations the double mutations L452R
and E484Q can significantly reduce LY-CoV555’s binding affinity to RBD-v. Through MD
simulation, we highlighted the molecular mechanism on how LY-CoV555 can be efficaciously
bound with wide-type RBD but fails to bind RBD-v in variant B.1.617. Our alchemy FEP
calculations show that binding free energy changes for L452R and E484K mutations are 3.04
and 22.22 kcal/mol respectively, indicating that these two mutations substantially weaken
the binding between RBD-v and LY-CoV555 and thus are evasive. However, we emphasize
that these two mutations are not resistant to LY-CoV016 (or Etesevimab that is another
antibody in Lilly’s antibody cocktail), as shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information.
We employed CASTELO to further analyze what other residues can possibly weaken
the RBD’s binding with LY-CoV555 after mutations. Interestingly, besides L452 and E484
whose mutations have occurred in B.1.617 already, CASTELO also identified L492 and
N450 to be important for RBD’s binding with LY-CoV555. Noteworthily, L492 was found
to be important for RBD’s binding with the antibody BD23, 25 while N450 were previously
identified as critical for the binding with the antibody CoV2-06 26 and its mutations to other

amino acids have proven to be resistant to various neutralizing antibodies. 27 Here, possible
L492R and N450I mutations in SARS-CoV-2 might be deleterious for LY-CoV555’s binding
with RBD-v and thus can be evasive as well.
Besides LY-CoV555, these two mutations in the variant B.1.617 might reduce the binding
affinity with other antibodies as well. For example, E484 coordinates N52/S55 (through
hydrogen bonds) in the complex of RBD and the antibody S2M11, and consequently the
mutation E484Q might weaken the complex, 19 which warrants further studies. Overall,
our work shed light on the mechanism of evasive mutations of the variant B.1.617 and can
facilitate the design of new antibody drugs specifically targeting the variant B.1.617.

Methods
MD simulations We carried out all-atom MD simulations for the complex of RBD and
the Fab of LY-CoV555 (PDB code: 7KMG) using the NAMD2.13 package 28 running on the
IBM Power Cluster. The complex was solvated in a cubic water box that measures about
110×110×110 Å3 . K+ and Cl− were added to neutralize the entire simulation system and set
the ion concentration to be 0.15 M (Figs. 1a). The final simulation system comprises 132,308
atoms. The built system was first minimized for 10 ps and further equilibrated for 1000 ps in
the NPT ensemble (P ∼ 1 bar and T ∼ 300 K), with atoms in the backbones harmonically
restrained (spring constant k=1 kcal/mol/Å2 ). The production run was performed in the
NPT ensemble without any restraint. The same approach was applied in the production
run for RBD in a 0.15 M KCl electrolyte (Fig. S1 in Supporting Information), a free state
required in the free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations (see below). The water box for
the RBD-only simulation also measures about 110×110×110 Å3 . Note that the same system
size for the bound and the free states are required for free energy perturbation calculations
for mutations with a net charge change.
We used the CHARMM36m force field 29 for proteins, the TIP3P model 30,31 for water, the

standard force field 32 for K+ and Cl− . The periodic boundary conditions (PBC) were applied
in all three dimensions. Long-range Coulomb interactions were calculated using particlemesh Ewald (PME) full electrostatics with the grid size of about 1 Å in each dimension.
The pair-wise van der Waals (vdW) energies were computed using a smooth (10-12 Å)
cutoff. The temperature T was kept at 300 K by applying the Langevin thermostat, 33 while
the pressure was maintained constant at 1 bar using the Nosé-Hoover method. 34 With the
SETTLE algorithm 35 enabled to keep all bonds rigid, the simulation time-step was 2 fs for
bonded and non-bonded (including vdW, angle, improper and dihedral) interactions, and
the time-step for Coulomb interactions was 4 fs, with the multiple time-step algorithm. 36

Free energy perturbation calculations After equilibrating the structures in bound and
free states, we performed free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations. 21 In the perturbation
method, many intermediate stages (denoted by λ) whose Hamiltonian H(λ)=λHf +(1-λ)Hi
are inserted between the initial and final states to yield a high accuracy. With the softcore
potential enabled, λ in each FEP calculation for the bound or free state varies from 0
to 1.0 in 20 perturbation windows (lasting 300 ps in each window), yielding gradual (and
progressive) annihilation and exnihilation processes for L452 and R452 (or for E484 and
Q484), respectively. More detailed procedures can be found in our previous work. 18? In
FEP runs for the E484Q mutation, the net charge of the MD system changed from -1 to 0
e (where e is the elementary charge). It is important to have similar sizes of the simulation
systems for the free and the bound states, 37,38 so that the energy shifts from the Ewald
summation (due to the net charge in the final simulation system) approximately cancel out
when calculating ∆∆G.

CASTELO Pipeline
CASTELO, 23 or “clustered atom subtypes aided lead optimization”, is a combined molecular
dynamics (MD) and machine learning (ML) method that identifies improvable atoms or

atom groups in a drug lead molecule (such as small molecule drugs 23 and peptides 24 ). We
followed the previous study, 24 where CASTELO was applied to a protein-peptide binding
simulations and applied the same workflow on the RBD-antibody binding simulations. In
short, we calculated the contact matrix between RBD and antibody at each individual timeframe (time t) of the simulations. The elements of the calculated contact matrix consisted
of the closest-heavy distances between M residues of antibody and N residues of the RBD.
Note that closest-heavy distance between residue i and residue j is calculated as the minimal
distance between all interfacial pairs of heavy atoms (non-hydrogen atoms) in these two
residues. In addition to the contact matrix, we enriched the extracted information at time
t with the difference contact matrix between t and t − δ. The resulting 2 × M × N matrix
is coined “dynamism tensor", which contains both static contact information and dynamic
information of the protein binding complex at time t. Subsequently, we used Convolutional
Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to represent each dynamism tensor in a d-dimensional
latent space (with a vector of d elements). For each residue, we used HDBSCAN 39 as our
clustering method to identify the clusters at the latent space (Figure 4A). As a comparison,
we used conventional RMSD clustering method (quality threshold method in VMD 40 ) to
identify the clusters of the binding interface (defined as the residues within 5 Å of its binding
partner). Eventually, we compared the individual residue-wise clusters and the binding
interface clusters with comparison metrics (summarized as the CASTELO score, plotted in
Figure 4B) to rank the residues from most beneficial to the protein-protein interactions to the
most malicious to the interactions. To calculate the CASTELO scores, we first utilize the dv
scores presented by Gionis et al. 41 that compares two clustering results (see Bell et al. 24 ). We
then normalize the dv scores using the equation: (dvi − Σi dv/N )/maxi (dvi − Σi dv/N ), which
is denoted as the CASTELO score. All parameters were adopted from a previous study, 24
except that the cutoff distance of the contact matrix was changed to 4 Å and convolutional
filter size was changed to 1 × 3 to accommodate the small cutoff distance.
