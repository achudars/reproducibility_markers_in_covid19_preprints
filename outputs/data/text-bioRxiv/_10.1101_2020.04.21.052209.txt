Abstract
The COVID-19 outbreak has become a global pandemic responsible for over 2,000,000
confirmed cases and over 126,000 deaths worldwide. In this study, we examined the
immunogenicity of CHO-expressed recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1-Fc fusion protein in
mice, rabbits, and monkeys as a potential candidate for a COVID-19 vaccine. We
demonstrate that the S1-Fc fusion protein is extremely immunogenic, as evidenced by
strong antibody titers observed by day 7. Strong virus neutralizing activity was
observed on day 14 in rabbits immunized with the S1-Fc fusion protein using a
pseudovirus neutralization assay. Most importantly, in less than 20 days and three
injections of the S1-Fc fusion protein, two monkeys developed higher virus neutralizing
titers than a recovered COVID-19 patient in a live SARS-CoV-2 infection assay. Our
data strongly suggests that the CHO-expressed SARS-CoV-2 S1-Fc recombinant
protein could be a strong candidate for vaccine development against COVID-19.

Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019[1-5]. In
four short months, the virus has caused a global pandemic, with over 2,000,000
confirmed cases and over 126,000 deaths worldwide. As a novel coronavirus with no
effective treatments or drugs currently available, a vaccine is in dire need of
development. Several broad approaches to the development of a COVID-19 vaccine
have emerged, including DNA vaccines, RNA vaccines, viral vector vaccines,
recombinant subunit vaccines, and dead viral preparations[6]. Among these, an RNA
vaccine from Moderna was the first to reach human trials in early March in the US,
followed by Cansino’s adenoviral vector vaccine which began human trials in China
later in the same month.
Considering the spike protein is the receptor-binding protein that mediates viralcell fusion during the initial infection event[7, 8], it has been favorably selected as a
primary target for vaccine design. The spike protein has a total of 1,273 amino acids,
which can be divided into two major domains according to their structures and
functions[7, 9]. The first half is the S1 protein, which contains the RBD sequence and
is located at the N-terminus of the spike protein[7, 10, 11]. The second half is the S2,
serving as a trimeric structure that supports the S1 receptor binding site and has a fusion
bundle which protrudes out into the host cell’s membrane after it is triggered by the S1
coming into contact with ACE II[9, 11, 12]. Due to the fact that most of the neutralizing
epitopes are located within the S1 region, proteins containing the S1 region, the RBD,
or even a trimeric approach to the S1+S2 have been considered as candidates for

vaccine development[13].
In this study, we cloned the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein (GenBank: QIC53204.1) as
our vaccine candidate into a eukaryotic expressing construct and stably expressed
CHO-K1 cells. The purified S1 protein was formulated with AD11.10 adjuvant before
being immunized into mice, rabbits, and monkeys. Besides eliciting high levels of the
anti-S1 antibodies, higher neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 were also found
in the anti-sera from monkeys when compared with the sera from a convalescent SARSCoV-2 human patient. These results indicate that the S1 protein can effectively induce
humoral immune responses in various animals and can elicit high levels of neutralizing
antibodies in monkeys.

years old Cynomolgus monkeys were immunized with CHO-expressed SARS-CoV-2
S1-Fc fusion after formulated with adjuvants according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Blood samples were collected at different time points for measurement of antibody
levels and neutralizing titers.
Enzyme-linked immunoassay
The assay was carried out as described by Zhao RQ, et al[14]. Briefly, wells of 96well plate were coated with 1.5 μg/mL of SARS-CoV-2 S1-His6X protein, blocked
with 3% BSA-PBS. Serial dilutions of sera were first diluted with the normal sera from
the same species, further diluted with Sample Dilution Buffer (20% Calf serum in PBS,
20%CS-PBS). 100μL of the diluted samples were transferred to each well of the plates.
The captured antibodies were probed with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. After
final washes, HRP substrate TMB solution (Beijing Kwinbon, China) was added and
absorbencies were measured at 450nm with a microplate reader.
Pseudovirus neutralization assay
HEK 293T cells and ACE2-transfected HEK 293T cells (ACE2-293T) were
cultured in DMEM (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS, Gibco), 50 U/ml penicillin (Gibco) and 50μg/ml streptomycin (Gibco) at
37oC with 5% CO2. HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with 10μg of a plasmid
encoding SARS-CoV-2 S protein and 10μg of an env-deficient, luciferase-expressing
HIV vector (pNL4–3.luc.RE) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagents (Life Technologies,
USA). After 48 h, pseudovirus-containing culture supernatants were collected, filtered

(0.45 μm), and stored at -80°C in 1ml aliquots.
ACE2-293T cells were seeded in 96-well plates at one day prior to infection. Heatinactivated serum samples were 3-fold serially diluted and incubated with 200 TCID50
pseudoviruses for 1 h at 37°C. The mixtures were then used to infect ACE2-293T cells
in triplicate. Following 12 h infection, wells were replenished with fresh medium and
the luciferase activities of cells were determined 48 h later. Cells were lysed with lysis
buffer (Glo-lysis buffer, Promega), followed by addition of luciferase substrate (BrightGlo luciferase assay substrate, Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using a
GloMax 96 microplate luminometer (Promega) and wells producing relative
luminescence units (RLU) above three times of the mean background value were
defined as positive. The 50% neutralization titer was calculated by probit analysis using
the SPSS software.
SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing assay.
Serum samples were inactivated at 56C for 0.5h and serially diluted with cell
culture medium in two-fold steps. The diluted serums were mixed with SARS-CoV-2
suspension of 100 TCID50 in 96-well plates at a ratio of 1:1, followed by 2 hours
incubation at 36.5C in a 5% CO2 incubator. 1-2 104 Vero cells were then added to the
serum-virus mixture, and the plates were incubated for 5 days at 36.5C in a 5% CO2
incubator. Cytopathic effect (CPE) of each well was recorded under microscopes, and
the neutralizing titer was calculated by the dilution number of 50% protective condition.

Production of SARS-CoV-2 S1-Fc fusion protein
The S1 protein (14Q-685R) was fused with Fc fragment of human IgG1 for ease
of purification, and expressed by a stable CHO cell line. S1-Fc fusion protein was
purified from the culture supernatant using a Protein-A column, as shown in Fig.S1A.
The purity of S1-Fc protein was evaluated by running SDS-PAGE gel under reduced
and non-reduced conditions, a band between 130-180 kD was detected as monomer of
the S1-Fc, while the dimer appeared as a single band well above 180 kD molecule
marker, suggesting the protein is heavily glycosylated (Fig.S1B).
Immunizations of animals with SARS-CoV-2 S1-Fc fusion protein
The original purpose of this study was to generate positive control SARS-CoV-2
S1 antibodies for development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and serological assays. Strong
adjuvants, such as Freund's complete adjuvant (CFA) and AD11.10 (saponin-based
microemulsion) were used to immunize animals.
Four 4-weeks old female Balb/c mice were first immunized with recombinant
SARS-CoV-2 S1-Fc protein immersed in CFA and boost with S1-Fc protein in AD11.10
multiple times in short intervals. The tail bleeds were collected at different times and
the antibody titers were examined by ELISA against purified SARS-CoV-2 S1-His6X.
On day 7, all of the immunized mice showed syndrome of fevers, much earlier than
usual, suggesting S1-Fc fusion protein is super immunogenic. The tail bleeds were
collected right way and the anti-S1 antibody IgG titers were examined using HRPconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Fc-specific secondary antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A,

all of the four immunized mice already developed strong IgG titers (1:200 to 1:500)
against SARS-CoV-2 S1 on Day 7. With one more boost on day 7, mouse #2’s anti-S1
IgG titer reached 1:5000 on day 12. It was sacrificed and the spleenocytes were used to
generate mouse monoclonal antibodies. The remaining three mice also developed antiS1 IgG titers higher than 1:10,000 on day 14 and day 20.
The volume of mouse sera is too little to meet the needs for positive controls so two
rabbits were immunized with S1-Fc fusion protein at a later day. On day 14 after
multiple injections, similar to mice, the S1-Fc immunized rabbits already developed
very high titers (1: 5,000 or higher) against the S1 protein (see Fig 1B).
In addition, one female and one male monkey were immunized with S1-Fc protein
using CFA+AD11.10 (500μg each on Day 1, 5 and 23). The sera were collected on
different days and evaluated by ELISA. HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (H+L)
secondary antibodies, which react with IgM, IgG1, IgG2, IgG4, were used for detection
of total anti-S1 antibodies, while HRP-labeled anti-human IgG Fc and HRP-conjugated
mouse anti-human μ-Chain were used for detections of IgG and IgM respectively.
As shown in Fig 2A, on day 9, anti-S1 total antibodies were detected only in the
female monkey. On day 16, after two more boosts, good titers of anti-S1 total antibodies
were observed in both monkeys. However, on day 23, there was a significant drop of
total antibody titer in the female monkey. One boost was given on Day 24 and the total
antibody titers in both monkeys increased greatly.
When we used isotype-specific secondary antibodies to re-examine the sera, as

shown in Fig. 2B, only anti-S1 IgG antibodies were seen in the female monkey on day
9. On day 16, strong anti-S1 IgG titers were detected in both monkeys, while the IgM
levels were undetectable. Interestingly, after one more boost of S1-Fc on day 24, not
only a big increase in anti-S1 IgG titers but also significant increase in anti-S1 IgM
titers was observed. So when both S1-specific IgM and IgG were detected in the
COVID-19 patients, it maybe be an indication either re-infection or re-emerging of
SARS-CoV-2 from the infected human cells.
We also examined the levels of anti-S1 IgG and IgM antibodies in the plasma
samples collected at different days post onset of COVID-19 disease from a recovered
patient. As shown in Fig. 3, the IgG antibodies can be detected 4 days after onset and
the titer increased on day 12, but reduced significantly on day 20 and 28. No IgM was
detected.
Neutralization activities of SARS-CoV-2 S1-Fc fusion protein antisera
The virus neutralizing activities of the S1-Fc immunized sera were examined using
either pseudo-virus or live SARS-CoV-2.
The neutralizing activity of the sera from S1-Fc immunized rabbits was examined
using SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus. Briefly, heat-inactivated serum samples were 3-fold
serially diluted and incubated with 200 TCID50 pseudo-viruses for 1 h at 37°C. The
mixtures were then used to infect ACE2-293T cells. Three days later, the luciferase
activities of the infected cells were measured. The 50% neutralization titer was
calculated by probit analysis using the SPSS software. As shown in Fig. 4A, a

neutralizing titer of 1:378 was obtained after the rabbits received three consecutive
immunizations.
We also compared the neutralizing titers of the sera from S1-Fc immunized
monkeys with the ones of recovered COVID-19 patient’s plasma samples using live
SARS-CoV-2. Heat-inactivated serum samples were first serially diluted with cell
culture medium, pre-incubated live SARS-CoV-2 suspension of 100 TCID50 for 2
hours at 36.5C. 1-2 104 Vero cells were then added to the serum-virus mixture, and
the plates were incubated for 5 days at 36.5C. Cytopathic effect (CPE) of each well
was recorded under microscopes, and the neutralizing titer was calculated by the
dilution number of 50% protection. As shown in Fig. 4B, immunization of SARS-CoV2 S1-Fc fusion protein induced very high neutralizing activities with titers >1:1024 in
both monkeys against live SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the neutralizing titers of
human sera from the recovered COVID-19 patient were at 1:512 on day 4 and day 12,
but dropped to 1:384 on day 28 post the onset of disease, matched with the decrease of
antibody levels in the plasma samples.
Our data clearly suggest the CHO-expressed full length SARS-CoV-2 S1-Fc fusion
protein can solicit very strong neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 in a very
reasonable short of time and could be a good candidate for COVID-19 vaccine
development.

major domains according to their structures and functions. The first half is an S1 protein
which contains the RBD sequence and is located at the N-terminus of the spike
protein[7]. The second half is the S2, serving as a trimeric structure which supports the
S1 receptor binding structure in place. Due to the RBD being located within the S1
region, we generated a S1-Fc fusion protein as a candidate for vaccine development.
Since the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein is predicted to have at least 16 N-linked
glycosylation sites[15], we chose mammalian cell CHO-K1 as the expression system
to ensure the right glycosylation. CHO-K1 is also one of the most popular cell lines
used to make human antibody drugs.
Shringrix, a vaccine based on the recombinant gE protein of varicella-zoster virus,
was launched in 2018 by GSK for prevention and treatment of shingles with great
success. The primary vaccination schedule consists of two dose of 50μg/0.5mL each
two month apart[16]. Assuming the same vaccination schedule for COVID-19, with the
stable expression level at 50mg/L of S1-Fc fusion protein, a 3,000 L CHO cell
Bioreactor can easily produce 3 million dose of recombinant S1-Fc vaccine every two
weeks. With so many antibody drug production plants in the world, it may be the ONLY
feasible way to make enough COVID-19 vaccines for the entire world within one year.
There are many therapeutic biological drugs such as TNF Receptor-Fc fusion
protein (Enbrel) that have been used for treatments of AMD and other human diseases
without any known side-effect caused by the Fc part of the drugs. Dimerization of S1Fc fusion protein via the disulfide bonds formed within the hinge regions of Fc may

help to mimic the 3D conformation of oligomerized S protein in vivo. Most importantly,
the human Fc domain fused to the C terminal of S1 protein greatly facilitates the
purification of the recombinant protein following the standardized antibody drug
manufacturing procedures.
Using the purified recombinant S1-Fc fusion protein as immunogen, we
demonstrated it not only has very good immunogenicity in mice, rabbits and non-human
primates, but also can elicit strong neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 infection
in vitro.
A study of its potential antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is currently
underway. We have been using the SARS-S1-His6X protein to challenge the mice
which have been immunized with S1-Fc fusion protein and exhibited strong antiSARS-CoV-2 S1 titers. At this moment, we have not observed any abnormality with
the mice.
Conclusion
In this study, we established a CHO-K1 cell line that stably expresses the SARSCoV-2 S1 protein with human IgG Fc fused to its C terminal. The purified recombinant
S1-Fc fusion protein formulated with a saponin-based microemulsion adjuvant was
used to immunize mice, rabbits and monkeys. Beside high levels of the anti-S1
antibodies elicited, higher neutralizing activities against live SARS-CoV-2 from the
anti-sera of monkeys were developed within 16 days when compared with the sera from
a recovered SARS-CoV-2 patient. Our results demonstrated that the S1-Fc fusion
