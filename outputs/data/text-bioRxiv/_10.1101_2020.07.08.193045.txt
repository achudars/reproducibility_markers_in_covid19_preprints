Abstract

35

The explosively expanding COVID-19 pandemic urges the development of safe, efficacious

36

and fast-acting vaccines to quench the unrestrained spread of SARS-CoV-2. Several promising

37

vaccine platforms, developed in recent years, are leveraged for a rapid emergency response to

38

COVID-191. We employed the live-attenuated yellow fever 17D (YF17D) vaccine as a vector

39

to express the prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen. In mice, the vaccine

40

candidate, tentatively named YF-S0, induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing

41

antibodies and a favorable Th1 cell-mediated immune response. In a stringent hamster SARS-

42

CoV-2 challenge model2, vaccine candidate YF-S0 prevents infection with SARS-CoV-2.

43

Moreover, a single dose confers protection from lung disease in most vaccinated animals even

44

within 10 days. These results warrant further development of YF-S0 as a potent SARS-CoV-2

45

vaccine candidate.

47

Vaccine design and rationale

48

Protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses is believed to depend on

49

neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) targeting the viral Spike (S) protein

50

specific for the N-terminal S1 domain containing the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2

51

(ACE2) receptor binding domain (RBD) interfere with and have been shown to prevent viral

52

infection in several animal models5,6.

53

The live-attenuated YF17D vaccine is known for its outstanding potency to rapidly induce

54

broad multi-functional innate, humoral and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) responses that may

55

result in life-long protection following a single vaccine dose in nearly all vaccinees 7,8. These

56

favorable characteristics of the YF17D vaccine translate also to vectored vaccines based on the

57

YF17D backbone 9. YF17D is used as viral vector in two licensed human vaccines [Imojev®

58

against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Dengvaxia® against dengue virus (DENV)]. For

59

these two vaccines, genes encoding the YF17D surface antigens prM/E, have been swapped

60

with those of JEV or DENV, respectively. Potent Zika virus vaccines based on this ChimeriVax

61

approach are in preclinical development 10.

62

YF17D is a small (+)-ss RNA live-attenuated virus with a limited vector capacity, but it has

63

been shown to tolerate insertion of foreign antigens at two main sites in the viral polyprotein 11.

64

Importantly, an insertion of foreign sequences is constrained by (i) the complex topology and

65

post-translational processing of the YF17D polyprotein; and, (ii) the need to express the antigen

66

of interest in an immunogenic, likely native, fold, to yield a potent recombinant vaccine.

67

Using an advanced reverse genetics system for the generation of recombinant flaviviruses12,13,

68

a panel of YF17D-based COVID-19 vaccine candidates (YF-S) was designed. These express

69

codon-optimized versions of the S protein [either in its native cleavable S1/2, or non-cleavable

70

prefusion S0 conformation or its S1 subdomain] of the prototypic SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1

3,4

. In particular, nAbs

strain (GenBank: MN908947.3), as in-frame fusion within the YF17D-E/NS1 intergenic region

72

(YF-S1/2, YF-S0 and YF-S1) (Figure 1A, Figure S1). As outlined below, variant YF-S0 was

73

finally selected as lead vaccine candidate based on its superior immunogenicity, efficacy and

74

favorable safety profile.

75

Infectious live-attenuated YF-S viruses were rescued by plasmid transfection into baby hamster

76

kidney (BHK-21) cells. Transfected cells presented with a virus-induced cytopathic effect;

77

infectious virus progeny was recovered from the supernatant and further characterized. Each

78

construct results in a unique plaque phenotype, smaller than that of the parental YF17D (Figure

79

1B), in line with some replicative trade-off posed by the inserted foreign sequences. S or S1 as

80

well as YF17D antigens were readily visualized by double staining of YF-S infected cells with

81

SARS-CoV-2 Spike and YF17D-specific antibodies (Figure 1C). The expression of S or S1 by

82

the panel of YF-S variants was confirmed by immunoblotting of lysates of freshly infected

83

cells. Treatment with PNGase F allowed to demonstrate a proper glycosylation pattern (Figure

84

1D).

85

In line with a smaller plaque phenotype, intracranial (i.c.) inoculation of YF17D or the YF-S

86

variants in suckling mice confirmed the attenuation of the different YF-S as compared to the

87

empty vector YF17D (Figure 2A and B and Figure S2). Mouse pups inoculated i.c. with 100

88

plaque forming units (PFU) of the parental YF17D stopped growing (Figure S2A) and

89

succumbed to infection within seven days (median day of euthanasia; MDE) (Figure 2A),

90

whereas pups inoculated with the YF-S variants continued to grow. From the group inoculated

91

with YF-S0 only half needed to be euthanized (MDE 17,5 days). For the YF-S1/2 and YF-S1

92

groups MDE was 12 and 10 days respectively; thus in particular YF-S0 has a markedly reduced

93

neurovirulence. Likewise, YF-S0 is also highly attenuated in type I and II interferon receptor

94

deficient AG129 mice, that are highly susceptible to (a neurotropic) YF17D infection13,14.

95

Whereas 1 PFU of YF17D resulted in neuro-invasion requiring euthanasia of all mice (MDE

96

16 days) (Figure 2B), a 1000-fold higher inoculum of YF-S0 did not result in any disease

97

(Figure S2C) and only 1 in 12 animals that received a 10,000 higher inoculum needed to be

98

euthanized (Figure 2B). In summary, a set of transgenic replication-competent YF17D variants

99

(YF-S) was generated that express different forms of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen and that are

100

highly attenuated in mice in terms of neurovirulence and neurotropism as compared to YF17D.

102

Immunogenicity and protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-like

103

disease in a stringent hamster model.

104

To assess the potency of the various vaccine constructs, a stringent hamster challenge model

105

was developed2. Animals were vaccinated at day 0 with 103 PFU (i.p. route) of the different

106

constructs or the negative controls and were boosted 7 days later with the same dose (Figure

107

3A). At day 21 post-vaccination, all hamsters vaccinated with YF-S1/2 and YF-S0 (n=12 from

108

two independent experiments) had seroconverted to high levels of S-specific IgG and virus

109

nAbs (Figure 3B,C; see Figure S3 for benchmarking of SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralization test,

110

SNT). For YF-S1/2 log10 geometric mean titers (GMT) for IgG and nAbs were 3.2 (95% CI,

111

2.9-3.5) and 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1-1.9) respectively, while in the case of YF-S0 GMT values for

112

IgG and nAbs of 3.5 (95% CI, 3.3-3.8) and 2.2 (95% CI, 1.9-2.6) were measured, with rapid

113

seroconversion kinetics (50% seroconversion rate < 2 weeks; Figure 3D). By contrast, only 1

114

out of 12 hamsters that had received YF-S1 seroconverted and this with a low level of nAbs.

115

This indicates the need for a full-length S antigen to elicit an adequate humoral immune

116

response.

117

Next, vaccinated hamsters were challenged intranasally (either at day 23 or day 28 post

118

vaccination) with 2 x 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2. At day 4 post-infection, high viral loads were

119

detected in lungs of sham-vaccinated controls and animals vaccinated with YF17D as matched

120

placebo (Figure 4A, B). Infection was characterized by a severe lung pathology with multifocal

121

necrotizing bronchiolitis, leukocyte infiltration and edema, resembling findings in patients with

122

severe COVID-19 bronchopneumonia (Figure 4A specimen pictures and 4B radar plot;

123

Supplementary- histogram). By contrast, hamsters vaccinated with YF-S0 were protected

124

against this aggressive challenge (Figure 3E-F). As compared to sham-vaccinated controls, YF-

125

S0 vaccinated animals had a median reduction of 5 log10 (IQR, 4.5-5.4) in viral RNA loads (p

126

<0.0001; Figure 3D), and of 5.3 log10 (IQR, 3.9-6.3) for infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus in the

127

lungs (p <0.0001; Figure 3E). Moreover, infectious virus was no longer detectable in 10 of 12

128

hamsters (two independent experiments), and viral RNA was reduced to non-quantifiable levels

129

in their lungs. Residual RNA measured in 2 out of 12 animals may equally well represent

130

residues of the high-titer inoculum as observed in non-human primate models15-18. Vaccination

131

with YF-S0 (two doses of 103 PFU) also efficiently prevented systemic viral dissemination; in

132

most animals, no or only very low levels of viral RNA were detectable in spleen, liver, kidney

133

and heart four days after infection (Figure S4A). Similarly and in full support, a slightly

134

different dose and schedule used for vaccination (5 x 103 PFU of YF-S0 at day 0 and 7

135

respectively) resulted in all vaccinated hamsters (n=7) in respectively a 6 log10 (IQR, 4.6-6.6)

136

and 5.7 log10 (IQR, 5.7-6.6) reduction of viral RNA and infectious virus titers as compared to

137

sham (Figure S5). Finally, vaccination with YF-S0 may induce saturating levels of nAbs

138

thereby conferring sterilizing immunity, as demonstrated by the fact that in about half of the

139

YF-S0 vaccinated hamsters no anamnestic antibody response was observed following challenge

140

(Figure 3G and S4B-D (paired nAb analysis)). By contrast, in hamsters vaccinated with the

141

second-best vaccine candidate YF-S1/2, nAb levels further increased following SARS-CoV-2

142

infection (in 11 out of 12 animals) whereby a plateau was only approached after challenge.

143

The lungs of YF-S0 vaccinated animals remained normal, or near to normal with no more signs

144

of bronchopneumonia which is markedly different to sham-vaccinated animals (n=12 from two

145

independent experiments; Figure 4). The specific disease scores and biomarkers quantified2

146

included (i) a reduction or lack of detectable lung pathology as observed by histological

147

inspection (Figure 4A,B, Figure S6A); and, (ii) a significant improvement of the individual lung

148

scores (p = 0.002) (Figure 4C, Figure S6B) and respiratory capacity (i.e* 32% less of lung

149

volume obstructed; p = 0.0323; Figure 4D) in YF-S0 vaccinated animals as derived by micro-

150

computed tomography (micro-CT) of the chest. In addition, immunization with YF-S0 resulted

151

in an almost complete, in most cases full, normalization of the expression of cytokines, e.g., IL-

152

6, IL-10, or IFN-γ in the lung, linked to disease exacerbation in COVID-19 (Figure 4E,F and

153

Figure S7)19-21. Even the most sensitive markers of viral infection, such as the induction of

154

antiviral Type III interferons (IFN-λ)22, or the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) such

155

as MX2 and IP-10 in YF-S0 vaccinated animals showed no elevation as compared to levels in

156

the lungs of untreated healthy controls (Figure 4F and Figure S7).

157

Overall, YF-S0 that expresses the non-cleavable S variant outcompeted construct YF-S1/2

158

expressing the cleavable version of S. This argues for the stabilized prefusion form of S serving

159

as a relevant protective antigen for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, in line with its failure to induce

160

nAbs (Figure 3B), construct YF-S1 expressing solely the hACE2 receptor-binding S1 domain

161

(Figure 1D) did not confer any protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in hamsters (Figure

162

3E, F and Figure 4).

166

Since there are very few tools available to study CMI in hamsters, humoral and CMI responses

167

elicited by the different YF-S constructs were studied in parallel in mice. Since YF17D does

168

not readily replicate in wild-type mice23,24, Ifnar-/- mice that are deficient in Type I interferon

169

signaling and that are hence susceptible to vaccination with YF17D, were employed10,24,25.

170

Mice were vaccinated with 400 PFU (of either of the YF-S variants, YF17D or sham) at day 0

171

and were boosted with the same dose 7 days later (Figure 5A). At day 21 all YF-S1/2 and YF-

172

S0 vaccinated mice (n>9 in three independent experiments) had seroconverted to high levels of

173

S-specific IgG and nAbs with log10 GMT of 3.5 (95% CI, 3.1-3.9 ) for IgG and 2.2 (95% CI,

174

1.7-2.7) for nAbs in the case of YF-S1/2, or 4.0 (95% CI, 3.7-4.2) for IgG and 3.0 (95% CI,

175

2.8-3.1) for nAbs in the case of YF-S0 (Figure 5B,C). Importantly, seroconversion to S-specific

176

IgG was detectable as early as 7 days after the first immunization (Figure 5D). Isotyping of IgG

177

revealed an excess of IgG2b/c over IgG1 indicating a dominant pro-inflammatory and hence

178

antiviral (Th1) polarization of the immune response (Figure 5E) which is considered important

179

for vaccine-induced protection against SARS-CoV-226-28. Alike in hamsters, YF-S1 failed to

180

induce SARS-CoV-2 nAbs (Figure 5B,C). However, high levels of YF nAbs were conjointly

181

induced by all constructs confirming a consistent immunization (Figure S8).

182

To assess SARS-CoV-2-specific CMI responses that play a pivotal role for the shaping and

183

longevity of vaccine-induced immunity as well as in the pathogenesis of COVID-1929,30,

184

splenocytes from vaccinated mice were incubated with a tiled peptide library spanning the

185

entire S protein as recall antigen. In general, vaccination with any of the YF-S variants resulted

186

in marked S-specific T-cell responses with a favorable Th1-polarization as detected by IFN-γ

187

ELISpot (Figure 6A), further supported by an upregulation of T-bet (TBX21), in particular in

188

cells isolated from YF-S0 vaccinated mice (p = 0.0198, n = 5). This CMI profile was balanced

189

by a concomitant elevation of GATA-3 levels (GATA3; driving Th2; p = 0.016), but no marked

190

overexpression of RORγt (RORC; Th17) or FoxP3 (FOXP3; Treg) (Figure 6B). Intriguingly,

191

in stark contrast to its failure to induce nAbs in mice (Figure 5A,C), or protection in hamsters

192

(Figure 2 and 3), YF-S1 vaccinated animals had a greater number of S-specific splenocytes (p

193

< 0.0001, n = 7) than those vaccinated with YF-S1/2 or YF-S0 (Figure 6A). Thus, even a

194

vigorous CMI may not be sufficient for vaccine efficacy. A more in-depth profiling of the T-

195

cell compartment by means of intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and flow cytometry

196

confirmed the presence of S-specific IFN-γ and TNF-α expressing CD8+ T-lymphocytes, and

197

of IFN-γ expressing CD4+ (Figure 6E) and γ/δ T lymphocytes (Figure 6F), in particular in YF-

198

S0 immunized animals. A specific and pronounced elevation of other markers such as IL-4

199

(Th2 polarization), IL-17A (Th17), or FoxP3 (regulatory T-cells) was not observed for YF-S1/2

200

or YF-S0. This phenotype is supported by t-SNE plot analysis of the respective T-cell

201

populations in YF-S1/2 and YF-S0 vaccinated mice (Figure 6G and S8 tSNE) showing an

202

increased percentage of IFN-γ expressing cells. It further revealed, firstly, a similar composition

203

of either CD4+ cell sets, comprising an equally balanced mixture of Th1 (IFN-γ+ and/or TNF-

204

α+) and Th2 (IL-4+) cells, and possibly a slight raise in Th17 cells in the case of the YF-S0

205

vaccinated animals. Likewise, secondly, for both constructs the CD8+ T-lymphocyte population

206

was dominated by IFN-γ or TNF-α expressing cells, in line with the matched transcriptional

207

profiles (Figure 6B). Of note, though similar in numbers, both vaccines YF-S0 and YF-S1/2

208

showed a distinguished (non-overlapping) profile regarding the respective CD8+ T lymphocyte

209

populations expressing IFN-γ. In fact, YF-S0 tended to induce S-specific CD8+ T-cells with a

210

stronger expression of IFN-γ (Figure 6G and S8). In summary, YF-S0 induces a vigorous and

211

balanced CMI response in mice with a favorable Th1 polarization, dominated by SARS-CoV-

212

2 specific CD8+ T-cells expressing high levels of IFN-γ when encountering the SARS-CoV-2

213

S antigen.

216

Finally, vaccination of hamsters using a single-dose of YF-S0 induced high levels of nAbs and

217

bAbs (Figure 7B and 7C) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, it appears a

218

single 104 PFU dose of YF-S0 yielded higher levels of nAbs (log10 GMT 2.8; 95% CI: 2.5-3.2)

219

at 21 days post-vaccination compared to the antibody levels in a prime-boost vaccination with

220

two doses of 103 PFU (log10 GMT 2.2; 95% CI: 1.9-2.6) (p = 0.039, two tailed Mann-Whitney

221

test) (Figure 3B). Also, this single-dose regimen resulted in efficient and full protection against

222

SARS-CoV-2 challenge, assessed by absence of infectious virus in the lungs in 8 out of 8

223

animals (Figure 7E). It should be noted that viral RNA at quantifiable levels was present in only

224

1 out of 8 animals (Figure 7D). In addition, protective immunity was mounted rapidly. Already

225

10 days after vaccination, 5 out of 8 animals receiving 104 PFU of YF-S0 were protected against

226

stringent infection challenge (Figure 7D and 7E).

Discussion

229

Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 need to be safe and result rapidly, ideally after one single dose,

230

in long-lasting protective immunity. Different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates are being

231

developed, and several are vector-based. We report encouraging results of YF17D-vectored

232

SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates. The post-fusion (S1/2), pre-fusion (S0) as well as the RBD

233

S1 domain (S1) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein were inserted in the YF17D backbone to

234

yield the YF-S1/2, YF-S0 and YF-S1, respectively (Figure S1). The YF-S0 vaccine candidate,

235

in particular, resulted in a robust humoral immune response in both, mice and Syrian hamsters.

236

Since SARS-CoV-2 replicates massively in the lungs of infected Syrian hamsters and results in

237

major lung pathology2,31-33 we selected this model to assess the potency of these three vaccine

238

candidates. YF-S0 resulted in efficient protection against stringent SARS-CoV-2 challenge,

239

comparable, if not more vigorous, to other vaccine candidates in non-human primate

240

models16,17,34. In about 40% of the YF-S0 vaccinated animals no increase in nAb levels (> 2x)

241

following SARS-CoV-2 challenge was observed, suggestive for sterilizing immunity (no

242

anamnestic response). In experiments in which animals were challenged three weeks after

243

single 104 PFU dose vaccination, no infectious virus was detected in the lungs. Considering the

244

severity of the model, it is remarkable, that in several animals that were challenged with SARS-

245

CoV-2 already 10 days after vaccination no infectious virus could be recovered from the lungs.

246

Reduction of viral replication mitigated lung pathology in infected animals with a concomitant

247

normalization of biomarkers associated with infection and disease (Figure 4 and S6). Likewise,

248

in lungs of vaccinated and subsequently challenged hamsters no elevation of cytokines, such as

249

IL-6, was noted (Figure 4F).

250

Moreover, YF-S0 showed in two mice models a favorable safety profile as compared to the

251

parental YF17D vector (Figure 2A and B). This is of importance as YF17D vaccine is contra11

252

indicated in elderly and persons with underlying medical conditions. These preliminary, though

253

encouraging, data suggest that YF-S0 might also be safe in those persons most vulnerable to

254

COVID-19.

255

In addition, cell-mediated immunity (CMI) studied in mice revealed that YF-S0, besides

256

efficiently inducing high titers of nAbs, favors a Th1 response. Such a Th1 polarization is

257

considered relevant in light of a disease enhancement supposedly linked to a skewed Th2

258

immune29 or antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)35. ADE may occur when virus-specific

259

antibodies promote virus infection via various Fcg receptor-mediated mechanisms, as suggested

260

for an inactivated RSV post-fusion vaccine candidate36. A Th2 polarization may cause an

261

induction

262

monocytes/macrophages26-28,37 resulting in an overshooting inflammatory response (cytokine

263

storm) thus leading to acute lung injury (ALI). No indication of such a disease enhancement

264

was observed in our models.

265

In conclusion, YF-S0 confers vigorous protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

266

Remarkably, this immunity can be achieved within 10 days following a single dose vaccination.

267

In light of the threat SARS-CoV-2 will remain endemic with spikes of re-infection, as a

268

recurring plague, vaccines with this profile may be ideally suited for population-wide

immunization programs.

Methods

272

Cells and viruses

273

BHK-21J (baby hamster kidney fibroblasts) cells37 were maintained in Minimum Essential

274

Medium (Gibco), Vero E6 (African green monkey kidney, ATCC CRL-1586) and HEK-293T

275

(human embryonic kidney cells) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium

276

(Gibco). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2 mM L-

277

glutamine (Gibco), 1% sodium bicarbonate (Gibco). BSR-T7/5 (T7 RNA polymerase

278

expressing BHK-21)38 cells were kept in DMEM supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml geneticin

279

(Gibco).

280

For all challenge experiments in hamsters, SARS-CoV-2 strain BetaCov/Belgium/GHB-

281

03021/2020 (EPI ISL 407976|2020-02-03) was used from passage P4 grown on Vero E6 cells

282

as described2. YF17D (Stamaril®, Sanofi-Pasteur) was passaged twice in Vero E6 cells before

283

use.

284

Vaccine design and construction

285

Different vaccine constructs were generated using an infectious cDNA clone of YF17D (in an

286

inducible BAC expression vector pShuttle-YF17D, patent number WO2014174078 A1)10,12,39.

287

A panel of several SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates was engineered by inserting a codon

288

optimized sequence of either the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S) (GenBank: MN908947.3) or

289

variants thereof into the full-length genome of YF17D (GenBank: X03700) as translational in-

290

frame fusion within the YF-E/NS1 intergenic region11,40 (Figure S1). The variants generated

291

contained (i) either the S protein sequence from amino acid (aa) 14-1273, expressing S in its

292

post-fusion and/or prefusion conformation (YF-S1/2 and YF-S0, respectively), or (ii) its

293

subunit-S1 (aa 14-722; YF-S1). To ensure a proper YF topology and correct expression of

294

different S antigens in the YF backbone, transmembrane domains derived from WNV were

295

inserted.

296

The SARS2-CoV-2 vaccine candidates were cloned by combining the S cDNA (obtained after

297

PCR on overlapping synthetic cDNA fragments; IDT) by a NEB Builder Cloning kit (New

298

England Biolabs) into the pShuttle-YF17D backbone. NEB Builder reaction mixtures were

299

transformed into E.coli EPI300 cells (Lucigen) and successful integration of the S protein

300

cDNA was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Recombinant plasmids were purified by column

301

chromatography (Nucleobond Maxi Kit, Machery-Nagel) after growth over night, followed by

302

an additional amplification of the BAC vector for six hours by addition of 2 mM L-arabinose

303

as described10.

304

Infectious vaccine viruses were generated from plasmid constructs by transfection into BHK-

305

21J cells using standard protocols (TransIT-LT1, Mirus Bio). The supernatant was harvested

306

four days post-transfection when most of the cells showed signs of CPE. Infectious virus titers

307

(PFU/ml) were determined by a plaque assay on BHK-21J cells as previously described10,14.

308

The presence of inserted sequences in generated vaccine virus stocks was confirmed by RNA

309

extraction (Direct-zol RNA kit, Zymo Research) followed by RT-PCR (qScript XLT, Quanta)

310

and Sanger sequencing, and by immunoblotting of freshly infected cells (see infra).

311

Immunofluorescent staining

312

In vitro antigen expression of different vaccine candidates was verified by immunofluorescent

313

staining as described previously by Kum et al. 2018. Briefly, BHK-21J cells were infected with

314

100 PFU of the different YF-S vaccine candidates. Infected cells were stained three days post-

315

infection (3dpi). For detection of YF antigens polyclonal mouse anti-YF17D antiserum was

316

used. For detection of SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen rabbit SARS-CoV Spike S1 antibody

317

(40150-RP01, Sino Biological) and rabbit SARS-CoV Spike primary antibody (40150-T62-

318

COV2, Sino Biological) was used. Secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-

319

594 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-594 (Life Technologies). Cells were counterstained with

320

DAPI (Sigma). All confocal fluorescent images were acquired using the same settings on a

321

Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope, employing a HCX PL APO 63x (NA 1.2) water

322

immersion objective.

323

Immunoblot analysis (Simple Western)

324

Infected BHK21-J cells were harvested and washed once with ice cold phosphate buffered

325

saline, and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific)

326

containing 1x protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

327

After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 minutes, protein concentrations in the cleared

328

lysates were measured using BCA (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Immunoblot analysis was

329

performed by a Simple Western size-based protein assay (Protein Simple) following

330

manufactures instructions. Briefly, after loading of 400 ng of total protein onto each capillary,

331

specific S protein levels were identified using specific primary antibodies (NB100-56578,

332

Novus Biologicals and 40150-T62-CoV2, Sino Biological Inc.), and HRP conjugated

333

secondary antibody (Protein Simple). Chemiluminescence signals were analyzed using

334

Compass software (Protein Simple). To evaluate the removal of N-linked oligosaccharides from

335

the glycoprotein, protein extracts were treated with PNGase F according to manufactures

336

instructions (NEB).

337

Animals

338

Wild-type Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) and BALB/c mice and pups were purchased

341

study.

342

Animal Experiments

343

Animals were housed in couples (hamsters) or per five (mice) in individually ventilated isolator

344

cages (IsoCage N – Biocontainment System, Tecniplast) with access to food and water ad

345

libitum, and cage enrichment (cotton and cardboard play tunnels for mice, wood block for

346

hamsters). Housing conditions and experimental procedures were approved by the Ethical

347

Committee of KU Leuven (license P015-2020), following Institutional Guidelines approved by

348

the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA). Animals were

349

euthanized by 100 µl (mice) or 500 µl (hamsters) of intraperitoneally administered Dolethal

350

(200 mg/ml sodium pentobarbital, Vétoquinol SA).

351

Immunization and infection of hamsters.

352

Hamsters were intraperitoneally (i.p) vaccinated with the indicated amount of PFUs of the

353

different vaccine constructs using a prime and boost regimen (at day 0 and 7). As a control, two

354

groups were vaccinated at day 0 and day 7 with either 103 PFU of YF17D or with MEM medium

355

containing 2% FBS (sham). All animals were bled at day 21 to analyze serum for binding and

356

neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. At the indicated time after vaccination and prior

357

to challenge, hamsters were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a xylazine (16 mg/kg,

358

XYL-M®, V.M.D.), ketamine (40 mg/kg, Nimatek®, EuroVet) and atropine (0.2 mg/kg,

359

Sterop®) solution. Each animal was inoculated intranasally by gently adding 50 µl droplets of

360

virus stock containing 2 × 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 on both nostrils. Animals were

361

monitored daily for signs of disease (lethargy, heavy breathing or ruffled fur). Four days after

362

challenge, all animals were euthanized to collect end sera and lung tissue in RNA later, MEM

364

respectively.

365

Immunization of mice.

366

Ifnar1-/- mice were i.p. vaccinated with different vaccine constructs by using a prime and boost

367

of each 4 x 102 PFU (at day 0 and 7). As a control, two groups were vaccinated (at day 0 and

368

7) with either YF17D or sham. All mice were bled weekly and serum was separated by

369

centrifugation for indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA) and serum neutralization test

370

(SNT). Three weeks post first-vaccination, mice were euthanized, spleens were harvested for

371

ELISpot, transcription factor analysis by qPCR and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS).

372

SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR

373

The presence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in lung homogenates was quantified by

374

qPCR2. Briefly, for quantification of viral RNA levels and gene expression after challenge,

375

RNA was extracted from homogenized organs using the NucleoSpin™ Kit Plus (Macherey-

376

Nagel), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Reactions were performed using the iTaq™

377

Universal Probes One-Step RT-qPCR kit (BioRad), with primers and probes (Integrated DNA

378

Technologies) listed in Supplementary Table S1. The relative RNA fold change was calculated

379

with the 2-ΔΔCq method43using housekeeping gene β-actin for normalization.

380

End-point virus titrations

381

To quantify infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles, endpoint titrations were performed on confluent

382

Vero E6 cells in 96-well plates. Lung tissues were homogenized using bead disruption

383

(Precellys®) in 250 µL minimal essential medium and centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C) to

pellet the cell debris. Viral titers were calculated by the Reed and Muench method44 and

385

expressed as 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per mg tissue.

386

Histology

387

For histological examination, lung tissues were fixed overnight in 4% formaldehyde and

388

embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (5 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and

389

analyzed blindly for lung damage by an expert pathologist.

390

Micro-computed tomography (CT) and image analysis

391

To monitor the development of lung pathology after SARS-CoV-2 challenge, hamsters were

392

imaged using an X-cube micro-computed tomography (CT) scanner (Molecubes) as described

393

before2. Quantification of reconstructed micro-CT data were performed with DataViewer and

394

CTan software (Bruker Belgium). A semi-quantitative scoring of micro-CT data was performed

395

as primary outcome measure and imaging-derived biomarkers (non-aerated lung volume) as

396

secondary measures, as previously described2,45-48.

404

To detect SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in hamster and mouse serum, an in-house developed

405

indirect IFA (IIFA) was used. Using CRISPR/Cas9, a CMV-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-Flag-IRES-

406

mCherry-P2A-BlastiR cassette was stably integrated into the ROSA26 safe harbor locus of

407

HEK293T cells49. To determine SARS-CoV-2 Spike binding antibody end titers, 1/2 serial

408

serum dilutions were made in 96-well plates on HEK293T-Spike stable cells and HEK293T wt

409

cells in parallel. Goat-anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (A11001, Life Technologies), goat-anti-

410

mouse IgG1, IgG2b and IgG2c Alexa Fluor 488 (respectively 115-545-205, 115-545-207 and

411

115-545-208 from Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibody. After

412

counterstaining with DAPI, fluorescence in the blue channel (excitation at 386 nm) and the

413

green channel (excitation at 485 nm) was measured with a Cell Insight CX5 High Content

414

Screening platform (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Specific SARS2-CoV-2 Spike staining is

415

characterized by cytoplasmic (ER) enrichment in the green channel. To quantify this specific

416

SARS-CoV-2 Spike staining the difference in cytoplasmic vs. nuclear signal for the HEK293T

417

wt conditions was subtracted from the difference in cytoplasmic vs. nuclear signal for the

418

HEK293T SARS-CoV-2 Spike conditions. All positive values were considered as specific

419

SARS-CoV-2 staining. The IIFA end titer of a sample is defined as the highest dilution that

420

scored positive this way. Because of the limited volume of serum, IIFA end titers for all

421

conditions were determined on minipools of two to three samples.

422

Pseudotyped virus seroneutralization test (SNT)

423

SARS-CoV-2 VSV pseudotypes were generated as described previously50-52. Briefly, HEK-

424

293T cells were transfected with a pCAGGS-SARS-CoV-2Δ18-Flag expression plasmid

425

encoding SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein carrying a C-terminal 18 amino acids deletion53,54. One

426

day post-transfection, cells were infected with VSVΔG expressing a GFP (green fluorescent

427

protein) reporter gene (MOI 2) for 2h. The medium was changed with medium containing anti19

428

VSV-G antibody (I1, mouse hybridoma supernatant from CRL-2700; ATCC) to neutralize any

429

residual VSV-G virus input55. 24h later supernatant containing SARS-CoV-2 VSV pseudotypes

430

was harvested.

431

To quantify SARS-CoV-2 nAbs, serial dilutions of serum samples were incubated for 1 hour at

432

37 °C with an equal volume of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped VSV particles and inoculated on

433

Vero E6 cells for 18 hours. Neutralizing titers (SNT50) for YFV were determined with an in-

434

house developed fluorescence based assay using a mCherry tagged variant of YF17D virus10,39.

435

To that end, serum dilutions were incubated in 96-well plates with the YF17D-mCherry virus

436

for 1h at 37 °C after which serum-virus complexes were transferred for 72 h to BHK-21J cells.

437

The percentage of GFP or mCherry expressing cells was quantified on a Cell Insight CX5/7

438

High Content Screening platform (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and neutralization IC50 values

439

were determined by fitting the serum neutralization dilution curve that is normalized to a virus

440

(100%) and cell control (0%) in Graphpad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.).

441

SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)

442

Sera were serially diluted with an equal volume of 70 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 before incubation

443

at 37 °C for 1h. Serum-virus complexes were added to Vero E6 cell monolayers in 24-well

444

plates and incubated at 37 °C for 1h. Three days later, overlays were removed and stained with

445

0.5% crystal violet after fixation with 3.7% PFA. Neutralization titers (PRNT50) of the test

446

serum samples were defined as the reciprocal of the highest test serum dilution resulting in a

447

plaque reduction of at least 50%.

ELISpot

478

ELISpot assays for the detection of IFN-γ-secreting mouse splenocytes were performed with

479

mouse IFN-γ kit (ImmunoSpot® MIFNG-1M/5, CTL Europe GmbH). IFN-γ spots were

480

visualized by stepwise addition of a biotinylated detection antibody, a streptavidin-enzyme

481

482

(CTL Europe GmbH) and normalized by subtracting spots numbers from control samples

483

(incubated with non-infected Vero E6 cell lysates) from the spot numbers of corresponding

Fig. 3. Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of YF-S vaccine candidates in hamsters. (A)
Schematic representation of vaccination and challenge schedule. Syrian hamsters were immunized
twice i.p. at day 0 and 7 with 103 PFU each of vaccine constructs YF-S1/2 (blue, n=12), YF-S0 (green,
n=12), YF-S1 (red, n=12), sham (white, n=12) or YF17D (grey, n=12) (two independent experiments).
Subsequently, animals were intranasally inoculated with 2 × 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 and followed
up for four days. (B-D) Humoral immune responses. Neutralizing antibodies (nAb) (B) and total
binding IgG (bAb) (C) in hamsters vaccinated with different vaccine candidates (sera collected at day
21 post-vaccination in both experiments; minipools of sera of three animals each were analyzed for
quantification of bAb). (D) Seroconversion rates at indicated days post-vaccination with YF-S1/2 and
YF-S0 (number of animals with detectable bAbs at each time point are referenced). (E, F) Protection
from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral loads in lungs of hamsters four days after intranasal infection were
quantified by RT-qPCR (E) and virus titration (F). Viral RNA levels were determined in the lungs,
normalized against β-actin and fold-changes were calculated using the 2(-ΔΔCq) method compared to the
median of sham-vaccinated hamsters. Infectious viral loads in the lungs are expressed as number of
infectious virus particles per 100 mg of lung tissue. (G) Anamnestic response. Comparison of the levels
of nAbs prior and four days after challenge. For a pairwise comparison of responses in individual
animals see Supplementary Figure S4C and D. Dotted line indicating lower limit of quantification
(LLOQ) or lower limit of detection (LLOD) as indicated. Data shown are medians ± IQR. Statistical

Fig. 4. Protection from lung disease in YF-S vaccinated hamsters. (A) Representative H&E images
of the lungs of a diseased (sham-vaccinated and infected) and a YF-S0-vaccinated and challenged
hamster. Peri-vascular edema (blue arrow); peri-bronchial inflammation (red arrows); peri-vascular
inflammation (green arrow); bronchopneumonia (circle), apoptotic body in bronchial wall (red
arrowhead). (B) A spider-web plot showing histopathological score for signs of lung damage (perivascular edema, bronchopneumonia, peri-vascular inflammation, peri-bronchial inflammation,
vasculitis, intra-alveolar hemorrhage and apoptotic bodies in bronchus walls) normalized to sham (grey).
Black scalebar: 100 µm (C-D) Micro-CT-derived analysis of lung disease. Five transverse cross
sections at different positions in the lung were selected for each animal and scored to quantify lung
consolidations (C) or used to quantify the non-aerated lung volume (NALV) (D), as functional
biomarker reflecting lung consolidation. (E) Heat-map showing differential expression of selected
antiviral, pro-inflammatory and cytokine genes in lungs of sham- or YF-S-vaccinated hamsters after
SARS-CoV-2 challenge four days p.i. (n=12 per treatment group) relative to non-treated non-infected
controls (n=4) (scale represents fold-change over controls). RNA levels were determined by RT-qPCR
on lung extracts, normalized for β-actin mRNA levels and fold-changes over the median of uninfected
controls were calculated using the 2(-ΔΔCq) method. (F) Individual expression profiles of mRNA levels
of IL-6, IP-10, IFN-λ and MX2, with data presented as median ± IQR relative to the median of nontreated non-infected controls. For IFN-λ, where all control animals had undetectable RNA levels, foldchanges were calculated over the lowest detectable value (LLOD – lower limit of detection; dotted line).

presentation of immunization and challenge schedule. Ifnar-/- mice were vaccinated twice i.p. with
400 PFU each at day 0 and 7 in five groups: constructs YF-S1/2 (blue, n=11), YF-S0 (green, n=11), YFS1 (red, n=13), sham (white, n=9) or YF17D (grey, n=9). (B, C) SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels.
Titers of nAbs (B) and bAbs (C) at day 21 post-vaccination. (D) Seroconversion rates. Rates at
indicated days post-vaccination with YF-S1/2 and YF-S0 (number of animals with detectable bAbs at
each time point are referenced). For quantification of bAbs, minipools of sera of two to three animals
each were analyzed. Dotted lines indicate lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) or lower limit of
detection (LLOD). (E) IgG for YF-S1/2 (blue) and YF-S0 (green). Ratios of IgG2b or IgG2c over
IgG1 (determined for minipools of two to three animals each) plotted and compared to a theoretical limit
between Th1 and Th2 response (dotted line indicates IgG2b/c over IgG1 ratio of 1). Data shown are
medians ± IQR from three independent vaccination experiments (n > 9 for each condition). Statistical
significance between groups was calculated by a non-parametric ANOVA, Kruskall-Wallis with
uncorrected Dunn's test (B-C) or parametric One-Sample T-test (D) (ns = Not-Significant, P > 0.05, * P
< 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001, **** P < 0.0001).
