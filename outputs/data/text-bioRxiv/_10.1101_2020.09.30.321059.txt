Abstract:

11

Worldwide COVID-19 epidemiology data indicate clear differences in disease

12

incidence among sex and age groups. Specifically, male patients are at a higher death

13

risk than females. However, whether this difference is the consequence of a pre-

14

existing sex-bias in immune genes or a differential response to the virus has not been

15

studied yet. We created DeCovid, an R shiny app that combines gene expression data

16

of different human tissue from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and

17

the COVID-19 Disease Map gene collection to explore basal gene expression

18

differences across healthy demographic groups. We used this app to study differential

19

gene expression between men and women for COVID-19 associated genes. We

20

identified that healthy women present higher levels in the expression of interferon

21

genes and the JAK-STAT pathway leading to cell survival.

1 Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that
causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is without doubt the most severe health,
economic and social threat of our time. The COVID-19 has followed two infection
major waves in Spring and Fall 2020 and have reached the one million deceased people
by end September 2020. The understanding of the disease has evolved over time. While
initially COVID-19 was considered as severe atypical pneumonia, it soon became clear
that the virus can infect many tissues. Moreover, the disease affects blood coagulation
and can cause an exacerbated immune response referred to as the “cytokine storm”.
Although clinical management of COVID-19 has rapidly evolved over time, no curative
treatment is yet available, and current recommendations support the use of steroids,
oxygen, and a prophylactic dose of heparin. While accelerated vaccine development
efforts have resulted in tremendous advances in a relatively short time, the WHO

acknowledges that a vaccine solution for the general population might not be ready
before mid or late 2021. At the same time, very recent re-infection cases suggest that
immunity may not always persist, and active disease surveillance of past cases may be
required. As the second wave of the pandemic steadily progresses in Europe and the
US, possibly with new variants of the virus and affecting a more diverse and younger
population, novel or improved treatment targets and options are likely to remain as
important for the management of the disease.
One of the most intriguing aspects of COVID-19 is the different grade of severity
it affects different people. Although the acknowledged risk factors such as pre-existing
conditions such as cardiovascular disease (Zheng et al., 2020; D. Wang et al., 2020;
Chen et al., 2020), diabetes (Apicella et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020,
19), obesity (Simonnet et al., 2020), age (Liu et al., 2020; CDC COVID-19 Response
Team, 2020; LitCovid) and sex (higher mortality in men than women (Gebhard et al.,
2020; Jin et al., 2020) suggest a relationship between the physical condition and disease
progression, the precise pathways of this relationship have not been clearly established
yet. Sex-associated differences between males and females that have been proposed to
affect COVID-19 incidence include lifestyle (e.g., smoking and drinking) and mental
health. The smoking population of males is higher than females, and smoking may be
a risk factor for severe COVID-19 (Cai, 2020, 19; Jamal et al., 2016; Grundy et al.,
2020). In contrast, men differ from women during the pandemic in sleeping and signs
of depression (C. Wang et al., 2020). A recent study showed that male and female
COVID-19 patients differed in their immune response, with the first showing a stronger

cytokine response while the second is having a higher T-cell activation pattern
(Takahashi et al., 2020). Interestingly, the pattern of COVID-19 risk factors is not fully
shared with other similar recent pandemics such as SARS, MERS, H1N1. For example,
SARS patients were more frequent among the healthy young people (Yin and
Wunderink, 2018). Age and complications, but not gender, was the most significant risk
factors for mortality in the Arab and South Korean Studies of MERS (Park et al., 2018).
Several studies on the 2009 H1N1 influenza revealed the younger age, chronic
conditions, and female sex as risk factors of the disease (Viasus et al., 2011). This
suggests that the observed COVID-19 risk factors, especially those associated with age
and sex groups, might be the result of specific interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 with
intrinsic physiological characteristics, including the basal immunophenotype, of these
population groups. However, which specific immunological characteristics imprint an
existing condition that how this relates to COVID-19 remains to be explored.
The COVID-19 Disease Map initiative was launched in May 2020 with the aim of
creating a collection of genes and pathways relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection derived
from the growing COVID-19 literature. This resource contains over 1,500 COVID-19
disease genes distributed among 221 pathways (Ostaszewski et al., 2020), including
cytokine and interferon genes, and life cycle of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pathway.
The COVID-19 Disease Map is a valuable resource to investigate the molecular
responses to SARS2-CoV-2 infection and understand the biological pathways leading
to the severe manifestations of the disease. This database also creates an opportunity

for interrogating existing molecular data on differences associated with COVID-19 risk
factors in the general population.
In this paper, we present the DeCovid app, a Shiny app, to explore basal expression
level differences in COVID-19 disease map genes between men and women and
different age groups. We used data from the GTEx database, which contains RNA-seq
profiles for hundreds of demographically diverse healthy individuals in multiple tissues
and allows us to interrogate COVID-19 genes globally or individually. We used this
resource to study basal expression differences in COVID-19 genes between man and
woman and found that a different immunological state is prevalent in both genders.
Interestingly some of these differential pathways have been shown to be relevant for
disease severity progression and be characteristic of the sex-biased immune response
to the virus, providing ground for hypotheses on the molecular basis of the COVID-19
sex-bias. We anticipate that the DeCovid app could be a useful tool for researchers to
explore the molecular etiology of COVID-19 demographic differences.

Results
DeCovid as a user-friendly tool to explore gene expression of COVID-19 genes in
healthy individuals
The DeCovid shiny app combines a selection of human tissue specific GTEx data with
the COVID-19 Disease Map database to allow quick exploration of basal gene
expression values and differences in the healthy human population for genes described
to be important for COVID-19. We included data from blood, lungs, heart, kidney,

The sample size for different tissues is different in the GTEx datasets. The largest
sample size is the whole blood with 330 samples, while the smallest dataset is the
stomach tissue with 57 samples (Figure 1a). The total number of collected COVID-19
Disease Map is genes 1,523. A Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis indicates
that genes related to cytokines, response to virus, innate immune response,
transcriptional regulation, and kinase activity populate this collection (Figure 1b).

is selected, the age threshold value to classify samples as old or young should be

number of expression differences for COVID-19 genes followed by the brain. From
this simple analysis, we concluded that the COVID-19 Disease Map represents a
disease signature with significant differences across demographic groups that may be
worth exploring for hypothesizing on the molecular basis for differences in disease
incidence among these groups.

DeCovid identified basal sex-biased expression differences in immune-response
genes associated to differential disease incidence between man and women
Since COVID-19 fatality rates are consistently higher in men than women in many
different countries worldwide (Supplementary Figure 1), we hypothesized that sex is
a pre-existing condition that influences the severity of the disease and that the study of
basal differences in expression differences in COVID-19 relevant genes in healthy
individuals could reveal insights into the molecular basis of these differences. We used
the DeCovid app to explore these differences and concentrated on the blood tissue for
capturing systemic immune responses. A total of 67 genes (p.value < 0.05 and fold
change > 0.5) were differentially expressed between men and women in blood samples,
regardless of the age group (Figure 3a). We found high expression in females of genes

involved in the innate immune response, particularly type I interferons, such as
IFNA17, IFNA2, IFNE, IFIT1, and IFIT3, anti-apoptotic regulators such as BCL2A,
BCL2L1, and MCL1, and chemokines (CCL21, CXCL12) as well as the tumor necrosis
factor (TNFSF13B). On the other hand, males showed higher basal expression
proinflammatory chemokines (CXCL2) and cytokines (IL17, IL22, and IL3) genes.
These gene expression differences point to two major immune response pathways
differently active in men and women: interferon-mediated antiviral responses and the
cytokine activation response. Interestingly these two processes have been indicated as
distinctive pathways in the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 response (Hadjadj, J. et al.
2020).
Data suggest that females present a faster anti-viral response than males based on
three main aspects. First, the higher levels in the blood of anti-viral type 1 interferons
IFNA17, IFNA2, IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFNE, which serve as the first line of defense
against viral and bacterial infections (Boxx and Cheng, 2016). Moreover, type 1 IFN
enhances T-cell survival and effector functions through initial antigen recognition
(Huber and Farrar, 2011), which may facilitate restricted virus proliferation. This
transcriptional expression profile is in agreement with recent clinical studies that
showed that female patients have a high T-cell level (Takahashi et al., 2020), which
were postulated as a critical factor for the differential fatality incidence between sexes.
Therefore, with a high level of baseline expression of type 1 interferons, female patients
are more likely to maintain a high T-cell level in the early stage, which might lead to a
milder evolution of the disease.

top of each gene name display consecutively mean expression values for healthy

females present a more activated anti-viral response than males for anti-viral
interferons, B-cell homing and cell survival pathways, while males have higher basal
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Created with biorender.com/).
The relatively high levels of type 1 IFN in females could be related to the higher
expression of genes in the TLR4 and TRAF6 genes, which leads to the synthesis of
these cytokines (Makris et al., 2017). The TLR4/TRAF6/ NFkB1 pathway is likely
more activated in females, possibly due to the upregulation of the gene LY96
(lymphocyte antigen 96), which stimulates activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
cascade leading to the synthesis of type 1 IFN (Makris et al., 2017). LY96 significant
upregulation, as well as higher levels of TLR4, has been associated with resistance
against viral infections in several species (Shinya et al., 2012), including mice models
where mutations at TLR4 (Khanolkar et al., 2009) and type I IFN receptor (Haag et al.,
2009) were shown to be critical to control hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1) infection.
Here we speculate that these innate immunity pathways may play a crucial role in the

early control of respiratory coronavirus infection (Figure 3b). Moreover, data indicate
higher expression in women of JAK, multiple members of the STAT family, and cell
survival genes such as MCL1 and BCL2A. It has been shown that the Jak-STAT
signaling pathway mediates the synthesis of anti-apoptotic regulators such as MCL1,
BCL2A, and BCL2L1 upon induction of high type 1 interferon levels (Sepúlveda et al.,
2007), agreeing with the observed gene expression phenotype in females.
Finally, we detected significant increased tumor necrosis factor TNFSF13B
expression in females. This gene stimulates the synthesis of chemokines CCL21 and
CXCL12 through NFkB subunit 2 pathway, leading to B-cell homing through the
synthesis of CCL13 (López-Giral et al., 2004), lymphopoiesis through the synthesis of
CXCL12 (Silva et al., 2016; Sen, 2006), and development and survival through the
synthesis of TNFSF13B (Caamaño et al., 1998; Gerondakis and Siebenlist, 2010).
Since B-cells are part of the humoral immunity component of the adaptive immune
system and are responsible for mediating the production of antigen-specific
immunoglobulins (Ig) directed against invasive pathogens, higher levels of these
chemokines in females might lead to a faster response against a potential viral infection.
In males, in turn, the mentioned processes were comparatively downregulated, while
the only process upregulated compared to females were those related to the expression
of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Figure 3b), particularly IL17, IL22 and IL3. Also,
chemokine CXCL2 levels are higher in men, which supports the hypothesis of a first
stage of male response against a viral infection being more related to inflammation and
Th17 cell differentiation processes.

Discussion
Here we present the DeCovid app as a resource to explore sex and age differential
expression patterns in the healthy population for genes described to be involved in
COVID-19 disease pathways. The GTEx data, used in this work has been recently
mined for sex-specific expression differences concluding that these are tissue-specific
and generally small, also observed in our analyses(Oliva et al., 2020). This study
focused on the sex-specific genetic effects on gene expression associated to complex
genetic traits. In our application we repurpose the valuable GTEx database for the study
of COVID-19 relevant pathways while providing a mechanistic model to interpret
differential expression results.
We used DeCovid to investigate the gene expression differences between men and
woman that could explain differences in disease severity among these demographic
groups, with men being more likely to have a fatal outcome than women. We found
that two major immune response pathways were differentially expressed between men
and women in the healthy population. Women showed higher expression of interferon
genes while men have higher levels of pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokine genes. These
two pathways have been proposed to be critical factors for fatal response to the virus
infection, with patients that present an interferon-mediated response having a better
prognosis than those responding with a massive cytokine activation (Blanco-Melo et
al., 2020, 19; Hadjadj et al., 2020). In agreement, animal models of SARS-CoV-1 and
MERS-CoV infection showed that failure to elicit an early type 1 interferon response

correlates with the disease severity (Channappanavar et al., 2016). Perhaps more
importantly, these models demonstrate that timing is key, as type 1 interferons are
protective at the early stages of a viral disease. On the other hand, clinical studies
showed a differences in the immunophenotype between female and male COVID-19
patients with women having a more robust T-cells activation while male patients
presenting a higher plasma level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Takahashi et al.,
2020). In this study we showed that these immune system differences, which are critical
to COVID-19 progression, represent a sex-associated pre-existing condition that is
likely to create a differential predisposition to disease outcome between men and
women and may explain the observed sex-bias in COVID-19 mortality. Future studies
should address whether these gene expression patterns translate into functional
differences in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, whether they have prognosis value
and of if they present any relationship with hormonal levels, which have also been
linked to COVID-19 severity (Strope et al., 2020; Channappanavar et al., 2017; Scully
et al., 2020). All together our results show that DeCovid is a useful resource to
investigate the status of COVID-19 genes across demographic groups and human
tissues and postulate on the differential pathways to disease operating in each case.

samples belong to individuals with a “ventilator case” label as a cause of death were
discarded as they clearly segregated from remaining samples on a Principal Component
Analysis plot (Supplementary Figure 1). The COVID-19 Disease Map genes were
downloaded from https://github.com/wikipathways/cord-19 and available on March
17th, 2020. The list is mined from 9996 PMC papers in COVID-19 Open Research

to the COVID-19 disease process (Lu Wang et al., 2020).
DeCovid software
The DeCovid software is a Shiny app written in R with a user-friendly interface. The
app can be installed through a Docker image or directly download from GitHub (See
supplementary materials for installation). DeCovid already has integrated all
essential data from GTEx, and no additional downloads are necessary. Differential gene
expression is calculated using edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010) and multiple testing
