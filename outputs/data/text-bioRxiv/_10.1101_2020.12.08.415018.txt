Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs via airborne droplets and surface contamination. We show
tiles coated with TiO2 120 days previously can inactivate SARS-CoV-2 under ambient indoor
lighting with 87% reduction in titres at 1h and complete loss by 5h exposure. TiO2 coatings
could be an important tool in containing SARS-CoV-2.

Background
Within 10 months, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected 62
million people and has killed over 1.5 million worldwide. Respiratory droplets are believed to be the
major vehicle of SARS-COV-2 transmission. Droplets or other body fluids from infected individuals
can contaminate surfaces and viable virus has been detected on such surfaces, including surgical
masks, for hours, even days depending on different factors including humidity, temperature and type
of surface.1,2,3 One therefore infers that any external contamination of PPE may last hours or even
days.

Recently, there has been a further increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases across Europe and the UK, despite
severe mitigation measures following the first wave in the first half of 2020. More worryingly,
nosocomial transmission within hospitals is being observed despite universal adoption of wearing face
masks, regular testing of staff and patients, and social distancing measures. It may well be that
contamination of surfaces is now disproportionately contributing to transmission.4,5

Traditional forms of decontamination (such as alcohol-based sprays, quaternary ammonium
compounds, and sodium hypochlorite and other chlorine-based compounds) require repeated
applications. Photocatalytic surfaces, on the other hand, permanently oxidize, inactivate and destroy
microorganisms under normal ambient lighting conditions.6 A recent hospital study of titanium
dioxide-coated surfaces demonstrated progressive lowering of the bacterial bioburden.7 Moreover, the
radicals are not considered to induce antimicrobial resistance.8 TiO2 is especially attractive because it
is considered nontoxic to humans: titanium, coated with its oxide, is the most widely used material for
implants.9 TiO2 is also exceedingly stable, unlike other photocatalysts such as zinc oxide and tungsten
trioxide. Illumination of TiO2 generates highly oxidizing free radicals that are known to have
bactericidal and antiviral action against influenza and rotavirus.10,11,12 SARS-CoV-2 has not hitherto
been investigated.

Methods and materials
Cell lines
293T and Vero E6 cells were cultured in DMEM complete (DMEM supplemented with 100 U/ml
penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum). Vero E6 were a gift from Prof. Ian
Goodfellow. 293T cells were obtained from ATCC. ACE-2/TMPRSS2-expressing 293T cells were
generated as described previously.13

Pseudotyped virus
SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped HIV-1 luciferase particles were produced by transfection of 293T
cells with pCAGGS-SARS-CoV-2 spike, p8.91HIV-1 gag-pol expression and pCSFLW (expressing
the firefly luciferase reporter gene with the HIV-1 packaging signal) as previously described.15 Viral
supernatant was collected at 48 and 72 h after transfection, filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and stored
at −80 °C. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was
determined using the Steady-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega).

Viral isolate
Live SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2/human/Liverpool/REMRQ0001/2020) used in this study was
isolated by Lance Turtle (University of Liverpool), David Matthews and Andrew Davidson
(University of Bristol). A SARS-CoV-2 virus stock was produced by infecting Vero E6 cells at MOI
0.01. Culture supernatant was collected 48 h post-infection. The titre of the stock was determined by
adding tenfold serial dilutions of virus onto Vero E6 cells. 24 h post-infection cells were fixed, stained
for nucleocapsid protein (anti-Nucleocapsid antibody, MA5-36086, ThermoFisher) and %infection
determined by flow cytometry. SARS-CoV-2 virus titres were determined as infectious units per ml
(IU/ml) as follows: (% infected cells) x (total number of cells) x (dilution factor) / volume of
inoculum added to cells.

Surfaces and illumination
Virus stability was evaluated on the following surfaces: sterile untreated Sterilin standard Petri dish;
TiO2- and TiO2–Ag (Ti:Ag atomic ratio 1:0.04)-coated 45 x 45 mm ceramic tiles (Invisi Smart
Technologies UK Ltd). The coatings are transparent and colourless and therefore invisible to the
human eye. After coating the tiles were stored for 2–4 months before use. Surfaces were exposed (610
lx, ambient laboratory light) for 1 h before the start of each experiment to ensure a steady state of
radical generation. The same light was used during virus exposure, during which relative humidity
was approximately 65% and temperature 21 °C.

Surface inoculation and sampling
SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus inactivation
Tile surfaces were inoculated with 105 RLU of SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped HIV-1 luciferase
virus at time t = 0 and illuminated for up to 6 h. At intervals virus was recovered from surfaces with
DMEM complete followed by infection of ACE-2/TMPRSS2-expressing 293T cells. Luminescence
was measured using Steady-Glo Luciferase assay system (Promega) 48 h post-infection.

SARS-CoV-2 live virus inactivation
6x106 IU/ml of SARS-CoV-2 virus was added onto the surface of the tiles at a dosage of 2 μl over 5 x
5 mm. After illuminating for 0–300 min virus was recovered from surfaces with DMEM complete
followed by infection of Vero E6 cells. % of infected cells was determined by flow cytometry
detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein 24 h post-infection.

Kinetic analysis of inactivation
The main challenge is that laboratory inactivation experiments are necessarily carried out with large
numbers of viruses, with which the inactivating material is brought into contact at the beginning of

the experiment, and the decay of the entire virus population is measured.14 What is of practical
interest in the scenario of a coating designed to keep surfaces (e.g., in a hospital) free of viral (and
bacterial) bioburden is how quickly an individual virus is inactivated. According to analysis of
previously reported results for influenza virus inactivation,11 the kinetics fit a convective diffusion
transport model even in the absence of mechanical agitation, most likely due to almost inevitable
thermal gradients.14 The concentration of survivors is thereby predicted to follow a so-called
exponential decrease, and plotting the logarithm of the number of survivors v. time should give a
straight line, the slope of which is –k, the inactivation rate coefficient. The value of k can then be
compared with the transport-limited fastest possible rate calculated from the size of the virus.14

Results
After 1 h illumination the pseudotyped viral titre was decreased by four orders of magnitude (Figure
1A). There was no significant difference between the TiO2 and TiO2–Ag coatings. Light alone had no
significant effect on viral viability.

Next, we tested the ability of the coated tiles to inhibit fully infectious live virus. Coated and uncoated
surfaces were exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Virus was harvested at the times indicated and used to infect
Vero E6 target cells. SARS-CoV-2 was already significantly inactivated on the TiO2 surfaces after 20
min illumination. After 5 h no detectable active virus remained (Figure 1B). Significantly, SARSCoV-2 on the untreated surface was still fully infectious at 5 h post-addition of virus. TiO2–Ag
appeared somewhat less effective than TiO2 alone, but the difference was not significant.

Plotting the experimental data (Fig. 1B) as ln(titre) v. time (Fig. 1C) yields a disinfection rate
coefficient k of (5.2 ± 0.6) x 10–4 s–l, which corresponds to the transport-limited fastest possible rate
estimated for SARS-CoV-2 approaching a disinfecting surface in water.14 Hence we infer that the
viruses arriving at the surface from the inoculum are essentially immediately inactivated. From our
illumination conditions we estimate the generation rate of radicals as about 1013 cm–2 s–l,6
corresponding to about 800 radicals s–l over the area occupied by one virus at the surface, By

extrapolating the data from the first four points to the assumed detection limit, it can be seen that very
likely no detectable virus from the initial inoculum remained soon after 2 h exposure (Fig, 1C).
Discussion
The potent extended anti- SARS-CoV-2 effect of titanium dioxide surface coatings is highly
desirable in hospital settings where both patients and staff might be shedding viruses. An important
advantage of these surfaces is that they can be activated by ordinary interior light and do not need UV
irradiation, which is usually incompatible with simultaneous human presence. The coating has a
rough surface with high local curvature that creates an absorption tail into the blue region of the
visible spectrum,6 overlapping the spectral output of ordinary interior lighting. This is sufficient to
ensure an adequate rate of radical generation for effectively immediately inactivating viruses and
other microorganisms arriving from the air or hand touches. Conversely, a limitation is that if a
sudden very large contamination event occurred, particularly one that severely diminished the light
reaching the photocatalyst, it might take impracticably long for the contamination to be eliminated.
Hence, in that case rough cleaning, even washing with water, should be used to remove the gross
contamination.

The efficacy of the TiO2 coating under typical hospital lighting makes it a promising candidate for
enhancing the protection afforded by facemasks and other PPE, and well as surfaces likely to be
contaminated and hence acting as reservoirs for transmitting infection if left untreated.

(C) Plot of the data from (B) as ln(%infected cells) v. time. Dashed line, linear
regression using the first 4 data points, the slope of which is k. The 5 h titre (zero)
cannot be plotted as its logarithm but extrapolating the regression line to the
estimated virus detection limit (1%) suggests that complete inactivation was
effectively reached at 2 h 20 min (open circle).
