running title: Combinatory drug treatment targeting both virus and host-factors to inhibit

SARS-CoV-2 infection

ABSTRACT

18

The SARS-COV-2 pandemic and the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019

19

(COVID-19) urgently calls for efficient and safe antiviral treatment strategies. A

20

straightforward approach to speed up drug development at lower costs is drug repurposing.

21

Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting the host- SARS-CoV-2 interface

22

via repurposing of clinically licensed drugs and evaluated their use in combinatory

23

treatments with virus- and host-directed drugs. We tested the antiviral potential of

24

repurposing the antifungal itraconazole and the antidepressant fluoxetine on the production

25

of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in the polarized Calu-3 cell culture model and evaluated

26

the added benefit of a combinatory use of these host-directed drugs with remdesivir, an

27

inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase. Drug treatments were well-tolerated and potent impaired

itraconazole-remdesivir and fluoxetine-remdesivir combinations inhibited the production of

30

infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles > 90% and displayed synergistic effects in commonly used

31

reference models for drug interaction. Itraconazole-Remdesivir and Fluoxetine-Remdesivir

combinations are promising therapeutic options to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe

progression of COVID-19.

1. INTRODUCTION

35

The zoonotic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting COVID-19 pandemic impressively

36

show the global threat potential of a newly emerging pathogen. More than one million people

37

have died so far from the current outbreak, and the proportion of infected people was

38

estimated to reach more than 10% of the global population, with still unknown fatality rates

39

(Baud et al., 2020; Rajgor et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). Because of the pressing burden on

40

national health systems and economic losses, safe and efficient treatment strategies are

41

urgently required. Developing a vaccine is a high priority. However, the rigorous testing and

42

extensive clinical trials are time-consuming processes. While several trials are already

43

ongoing, there are no vaccines available yet, and the required widespread access remains a

44

challenging future task. Thus, approaches other than immunization might offer useful

45

additional options for the management and control of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the

46

treatment of COVID-19 (Fierabracci et al., 2020). A possibility to speed up the availability of

47

drugs for the treatment of novel infections is the use of drugs that are already in clinical use

48

for unrelated diseases via so-called "drug repurposing". This approach represents a

49

promising strategy to identify antiviral drugs with faster clinical implementation and lower

50

development costs, considerations that are especially important in the global COVID-19

51

pandemic (Pushpakom et al., 2018). In addition to drugs that directly target the virus, host

52

cell components that are vitally important in the viral life cycle are explored as promising

53

starting points for therapeutic intervention (“host cell-directed therapy”) (Schwegmann and

54

Brombacher, 2008; Ianevski et al., 2020; Zumla et al., 2020).

55

Although proteolytic cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein surface protein by the host

56

cell transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) enables SARS-CoV-2 to directly fuse

57

with the plasma membrane, endocytosed SARS-CoV-2 particles use endosome-residing

58

proteases for fusion within endosomes (Tang et al., 2020). Both pathways contribute to the

59

SARS-CoV-2 infection process, and the preferential use of the actual fusion pathway might

60

critically depend on the presence of plasma membrane proteases (Hoffmann et al., 2020).

61

Our earlier research on influenza virus infection identified the late endosomal cholesterol

62

balance as a critical factor in the influenza infection success and established this viral entry

63

point as a possible pharmacological target. Elevated cholesterol levels inhibit the fusion of

64

the influenza lipid hull with the endosomal membranes and thus inhibit the efficient transfer

65

of the viral genome into the host cytosol (Musiol et al., 2013; Kühnl et al., 2018). We found

66

that the clinically licensed antifungal itraconazole, a triazole derivative that blocks the fungal

67

ergosterol pathway, has antiviral properties against a range of viruses and is effective

68

against IAV infections in a preclinical mouse model (Schloer et al., 2019, 2020b). The

69

additional therapeutic function is most likely based on direct inhibition of the endosomal

70

cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) and the subsequent cholesterol

71

storage ((Trinh et al., 2017; Schloer et al., 2019)).

72

The late endosome is an entry site for many zoonotically transmitted viruses, in particular for

73

enveloped viruses including SARS-CoV-2 (Tang et al., 2020). Because of the functional

74

similarities in transmitting the viral genome into the host cell, the same endosomal

75

components might serve as pharmacological targets for a broad host-directed antiviral

76

strategy against such viruses. Continuing our work on the endosomal host-virus interface,

77

we explored whether a similar repurposing strategy could be used to impair SARS-CoV-2

78

entry and infection. Therefore, we assessed clinically licensed drugs that also affect

79

endolysosomal lipid storage and cholesterol build-up for their antiviral potential. Here we

80

report that itraconazole treatment potently inhibited the production of SARS-CoV-2

81

infectious particles. Together with our recently published work on the antiviral potential of the

82

widely used serotonin inhibitor fluoxetine, which also negatively affects endosomal

83

cholesterol release (Kornhuber et al., 2010; Schloer et al., 2020a) on SARS-CoV-2 infection,

84

the results presented in this study strongly argue for the endolysosomal host-SARs-CoV-2

85

interface as a druggable target. However, host-directed drugs will rather suppress infection

86

than completely eradicate the pathogen. The resulting demand for high drug doses and

87

early and prolonged treatment is often associated with poor patient compliance. While drugs

88

directly acting on virus structures are much more likely to completely eliminate the

89

pathogens in shorter treatment time, emerging viral resistance to these antivirals is a major

90

concern, as observed with the influenza neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir (Kim et al.,

91

2013). Thus, combination therapies using virus- and host-directed drugs are considered to

92

overcome these shortcomings. The nucleoside analog remdesivir which was originally

93

developed against Ebola (Warren et al., 2016), has antiviral properties with a broad

94

spectrum of activity against a number of RNA viruses and has already been shown to be

95

effective against SARS and Mers-CoV in animal experiments (Sheahan et al., 2017, 2020;

96

Agostini et al., 2018; Pruijssers et al., 2020). When remedesivir is incorporated into the viral

97

RNA, the synthesis is prematurely terminated, and viral replication is inhibited (Gordon et al.,

98

2020). Therefore, we explored combined treatments with remdesivir and the repurposed

99

drugs itraconazole and fluoxetine. Both drug combinations showed stronger antiviral

100

activities against influenza viruses compared to remdesivir monotherapy (Schloer et al.,

101

2020b). Importantly, the antiviral effects of the combined treatments deviated from the

102

expected effects, and pharmacodynamic evaluation via commonly used reference models to

103

study drug interaction revealed synergistic interaction.

104

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS

105

2.1 Cells and SARS-CoV-2 isolate

106

The human bronchial epithelial cell lines Calu-3 and the Vero E6 cells were cultivated in

107

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% standardized fetal bovine serum

108

(FBS Superior; Merck), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin,

109

and 1% non-essential amino acids (Merck) in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and 37 °C.

110

Calu-3 monolayers were polarized and cultured as described (Schloer et al., 2020b).

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.16.342410; this version posted October 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

111

Itraconazole (2 mg/mL, Sigma), fluoxetine (5 mM, Sigma) and remdesivir (10 mM, Hycultec)

112

were solubilized in DMSO. The SARS-CoV-2 isolate hCoV-19/Germany/FI1103201/2020

113

(EPI-ISL_463008, mutation D614G in spike protein) was amplified on Vero E6 cells and

114

used for the infection assays.

115

2.2 Cytotoxicity assay

116

Calu-3 cells were cultured at the indicated concentrations with either the solvent DMSO,

117

itraconazole or with the combinations of itraconazole/ remdesivir (ItraRem) or fluoxetine/

118

remdesivir (FluoRem) for 48 h. Staurosporine solution (1 μM) served as a positive control for

119

cytotoxic effects. After 48 hours of treatment, cell viability was evaluated by adding MTT

120

3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) to the cells for 4 h and

121

OD562 measurements according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Sigma).

122

2.3 Inoculation of cells and drug treatment

123

For infection, polarized Calu-3 and Vero cells were washed with PBS and inoculated at a

124

multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 (Calu-3) or 0.01 (Vero E6) of virus diluted in

125

infection-PBS (containing 0.2% BSA, 1% CaCl2, 1% MgCl2, 100 U/mL penicillin and 0.1

126

mg/mL streptomycin) at 37°C for 1 hours. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS and

127

further cultured in infection-DMEM (serum-free DMEM containing 0.2% BSA, 1 mM MgCl2,

128

0.9 mM CaCl2, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin) at 5% CO2 and 37 °C.

129

Cells were treated with the indicated remdesivir, itraconazole or fluoxetine concentration 2

130

hours post-infection (hpi) for the entire 48 hours infection period. After 48 hpi, apical culture

131

supernatants were collected and immediately frozen at -80 °C until titration via plaque

132

assay.

133

2.4 Plaque assay

134

To determine the number of infectious particles in the supernatant of treated cells, a

135

standard plaque assay was performed. Briefly, Vero E6 cells grown to a monolayer in

136

six-well dishes were washed with PBS and infected with serial dilutions of the respective

137

supernatants in infection-PBS for 1 hour at 37 °C. The inoculum was replaced with 2x MEM

(MEM containing 0.2% BSA, 2 mM L-glutamine 1 M HEPES, pH 7.2, 7.5% NaHCO3, 100

139

U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 0.4% Oxoid agar) and incubated at 37°C.

140

Virus plaques were visualized by staining with neutral red, and virus titers were calculated as

141

plaque-forming units (PFU) per mL.

142

2.5 Data and statistical analysis

143

A priori power analysis using G*Power 3.1 (Faul et al., 2007)) was performed to determine

144

the sample sizes required to detect > 90% reduction in virus titers at powers > 0.8. Data

145

were analyzed using the software GraphPad Prism version 8.00 (GraphPad). No outliers

146

were detected.

147

Infectious viral titers are presented as means±SEM of five measurements per

148

experiment per condition. For dose-response curves, drug concentrations were

149

log-transformed and virus titers were expressed as percentages of the mean virus titer in

150

control cells (treated with the solvent DMSO) and data were analyzed by curve fitting using a

151

4 parameter logistic model. Drug combinatory effects were analyzed by using

152

SynergyFinder, an open-source free stand-alone web application for the analysis of drug

153

combination data (Ianevski et al., 2017). Synergy was evaluated based on the Zero

154

Interaction Potency (ZIP), Bliss independence, and Highest single agent (HSA) reference

155

models (He et al., 2018). We further analyzed the overall drug combination sensitivity score

156

(CSS) by using the CSS method (Malyutina et al., 2019).

157

3. RESULTS

158

3.1. The clinically licensed antifungal drug itraconazole efficiently blocks the

159

production of SARS-CoV-2 infectious particles

160

Based on the successful use of repurposing itraconazole for the treatment of influenza virus

161

infection reported in our earlier studies (Schloer et al., 2019, 2020b), we first established

162

whether this clinically licensed drug also had an antiviral potential on the production of

163

infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles. In line with our previous results (Schloer et al., 2020a),

164

both Calu-3 and Vero E6 cell lines supported SARS-CoV-2 replication and produced high

165

virus titers (Fig. 1). Inoculation with the clinical isolate hCoV-19/Germany/FI1103201/2020

166

at MOI 0.1 yielded 1.46×106 PFU in Calu-3 cells and 6.37×106 PFU at MOI 0.01 in Vero cells

167

at 48 hpi. Treatment with itraconazole 2 hpi potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in a

168

dose-dependent manner in both cell types (Fig. 1a). Fitting the experimental dose-response

169

values to a nonlinear 4 parameter logistic model revealed half-maximal inhibitory (EC50) and

170

90% inhibitory concentrations (EC90) of 0.43 µM and 2.46 µM in Calu-3 cells, and even lower

171

50% and 90% inhibitory concentrations (0.39 µM and 0.87 µM) were determined for

172

itraconazole antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells (Fig. 1b). Of note, no

173

detectable cytotoxicity was observed with these doses (Fig. S1a). The itraconazole cytotoxic

174

concentration required to reduce cell viability by 50% (CC50) was determined at 25.56 µM,

175

resulting in a selectivity index (SI, defined as the ratio of CC50 to EC50) of 25.56 µM which

176

indicated an effective and safe antiviral window.

185

3.2 Remdesivir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in polarized Calu-3 cells

186

We addressed the question of whether a host-targeting drug could be used in combination

187

with a virus-directed drug for more efficient suppression of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Thus,

188

we first assessed the antiviral capacity of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog prodrug that

189

inhibits SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Gordon et al., 2020). The

190

EC50 concentration was reached at 0.42 µM and EC90 at 1.08 µM in Calu-3 cells (Fig. S2),

191

well in line with published data (Pruijssers et al., 2020). Next, we determined viral replication

192

in cells that had been treated with combinatory therapy. Because we recently published the

193

potential use of repurposing the antidepressant fluoxetine for treatment of SARS-CoV-2

194

infection (Schloer et al., 2020a), we also assessed the effects of a combined

195

fluoxetine/remdesivir (FluoRem) treatment in addition to the itraconazole/remdesivir

196

(ItraRem) combination (Fig. 2). Both drugs are clinically licensed and do not induce

197

significant cytotoxicity over the whole concentration range ((Schloer et al., 2020a), and Fig.

198

S1a). The combination treatments were also well-tolerated, and no cytotoxic effects were

199

seen when cells were simultaneously treated with the drug pairs (Fig. S1b, c).

200

3.3 Combinatory treatments with the drug pairs itraconazole-remdesivir or

201

fluoxetine-remdesivir show enhanced antiviral activity due to synergistic interaction

202

For all drugs, we chose those concentrations that were not sufficient to achieve a 90%

203

reduction when individually applied (Fig 3a). For both ItraRem and FluoRem combinations, a

204

potent reduction in virus titers was detected in all cases. Of note, several combinations

205

yielded a reduction > 90% of the maximum virus titers produced in control cells (Fig. 3b).

216

We, next considered the pharmacological interactions of the respective drug pairs. Thus, we

217

evaluated the drug interactions via Bliss independence, Highest single agent (HSA), and

218

ZIP, three commonly used reference synergy models that differ in their basic assumptions of

219

drug interaction they are based on. The results, presented in Figs. 4 and 5, consistently

220

argued for synergistic action of remdesivir with itraconazole and fluoxetine, as indicated by

221

the positive average synergy score across all models. Closer inspection of the drug

222

interaction relationships and landscape visualizations revealed that for ItraRem, the highest

223

synergy scores were calculated with the lower concentration ranges of both drugs (Fig. 4).

224

The strong synergy led to an overall drug combination sensitivity score (CSS) of 89.64,

225

resulting in >90% inhibition already at 500 nM of remdesivir and 250 nM of itraconazole.

226

FluoRem combination treatment had a higher average synergy score, as well as a higher

227

CSS score than ItraRem (92.82 vs 89.64), suggesting that this drug combination is more

228

likely to show synergy. Importantly, for all models, the FluoRem combinations that met the ≥

229

90% inhibition criterion were well within the high synergy area (Fig. 5).

et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2019). Indeed, remedesivir was the first new drug to receive an

245

FDA emergency use authorization for the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases. However, a

246

common concern about virus-directed antivirals is the development of drug resistance. Due

247

to their error-prone replication mode, drug-resistant viruses are increasingly encountered

248

(Strasfeld and Chou, 2010), as observed with the influenza neuraminidase inhibitor

249

oseltamivir (Kim et al., 2013). Because profound changes would be required to allow viruses

250

to replicate independently of otherwise essential host factors, the development of

251

host-directed therapeutics is an emerging concept. However, host-directed drugs will rather

252

cause impaired viral replication than complete eradication, thus demanding high drug

253

concentrations and starting treatment start as early as possible and for extended durations,

254

which is often associated with poor patient compliance. Because of these shortcomings,

255

combinatory treatments with both virus- and host-directed drugs are explored for enhanced

256

treatment success.

257

Enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 depend on the fusion of their lipid hull with the host

258

membrane to get access to the cytosol. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which protrudes

259

from the virus surface, mediates initial binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),

260

which serves as the host cell surface receptor (Li et al., 2003; Lan et al., 2020; Ou et al.,

261

2020; Zhou et al., 2020). To promote fusion with the host cell membrane, the spike protein

262

needs to be primed by proteolytic cleavage, which can be mediated by several host

263

proteases. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-mediated cleavage leads to

264

fusion with the plasma membrane, while endosome-residing proteases are utilized by

265

endocytosed SARS-CoV-2 particles for fusion within endosomes. Since both routes have

266

been reported to contribute to the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (Hoffmann et al., 2020), the

267

endosomal compartment is also a critical host/pathogen interface for SARS-CoV-2. Our

268

previous studies strongly support the late endosomal cholesterol balance as a cellular target

269

for antiviral intervention (Musiol et al., 2013; Kühnl et al., 2018; Schloer et al., 2019, 2020a,

270

2020b). Notably, endolysosomal lipid storage and cholesterol build-up could be induced via

271

repurposing of drugs approved for unrelated applications. We found that the triazole

272

derivative itraconazole, a clinically licensed antifungal drug (Organization, 2019) that directly

273

inhibits the endosomal cholesterol transporter NPC1 (Trinh et al., 2017) has an antiviral

274

potential on the endosomal fusion of enveloped viruses including influenza viruses (Schloer

275

et al., 2019). The findings presented in this study add SARS-CoV-2 to the spectrum of

276

itraconazole-sensitive enveloped viruses. Our results reveal a potent antiviral activity of

277

itraconazole on the production of SARS-CoV-2 infectious particles, with EC50 values

278

comparable to what we previously reported for itraconazole-mediated antiviral activity

279

against IAV subtypes. The bioavailability after oral application of itraconazole is low because

280

of the low water solubility of this compound (Grant Prentice and Glasmacher, 2005;

281

Domínguez-Gil Hurlé et al., 2006). Only limited amounts are absorbed from the

282

gastrointestinal tract after ionization, and levels depend on the individual gastric acidity (Shin

283

et al., 2004; Domínguez-Gil Hurlé et al., 2006; Bae et al., 2011; Lestner and Hope, 2013;

284

Allegra et al., 2017). However, our previous study revealed a beneficial antiviral activity in

285

vivo (Schloer et al., 2019).

286

We recently discovered that the widely used antidepressant fluoxetine has strong

287

SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity (Schloer et al., 2020a). Together with the findings presented

288

here on the inhibitory function of itraconazole treatment on SARS-CoV-2 replication, these

289

results suggest that both drugs are promising candidates for repurposing as a host-directed

290

drug for SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment. Both drugs most likely interfere with the proper

291

endosomal cholesterol levels. Whereas itraconazole und posaconazole both directly inhibit

292

the endosomal cholesterol transporter NPC1 (Trinh et al., 2017), fluoxetine functionally

293

blocks the endolysosome-residing enzyme sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase ("acid

294

sphingomyelinase", ASM), which in turn causes sphingomyelin accumulation and negatively

295

affects cholesterol release from this compartment (Kornhuber et al., 2010).

5. CONCLUSION

297

While remdesivir and the host-directed drugs itraconazole or fluoxetine target independent

298

pathways, we found that drug combinations together with remdesivir (ItraRem and

299

FluoRem) showed stronger antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 than the remdesivir

300

monotherapy. Moreover, the overall therapeutic effect of the combinations was larger than

301

the expected sum of the independent drug effects. Our analysis on the antiviral activity of

302

combinatory drug combinations via commonly used interaction models argue for an

303

enhanced efficacy that is based on synergistic drug interaction and suggests promising

304

novel options for SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
