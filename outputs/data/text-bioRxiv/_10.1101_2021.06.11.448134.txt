Abstract

19

The continuing emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants calls for regular assessment to identify

20

differences in viral replication, shedding and associated disease. In this study, African green

21

monkeys were infected intranasally with either a contemporary D614G or the UK B.1.1.7

22

variant. Both variants caused mild respiratory disease with no significant differences in clinical

23

presentation. Significantly higher levels of viral RNA and infectious virus were found in upper

24

and lower respiratory tract samples and tissues from B.1.1.7 infected animals. Interestingly,

25

D614G infected animals showed significantly higher levels of viral RNA and infectious virus in

26

rectal swabs and gastrointestinal tract tissues. Our results indicate that B.1.1.7 infection in

27

African green monkeys is associated with increased respiratory replication and shedding but no

28

disease enhancement similar to human B.1.1.7 cases.

Main Text

34

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 as the

35

causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 was declared a pandemic

36

by the World Health Organization in March 2020 (1) and has now infected more than 170

37

million people with over 3.7 million deaths (2).

38

Enhanced sequence-based surveillance and epidemiological studies have led to the identification

39

of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying distinct mutations that may impact transmissibility,

40

disease severity and/or effectiveness of treatments and vaccines. The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7

41

variant was first reported within the English county of Kent from the United Kingdom (UK) (3)

42

and has since been classified as a ‘Variant of Concern’ (VOC) associated with increased

43

transmissibility and potentially increased disease severity but with minimal impact on the

44

efficacy of monoclonal antibody treatment (4). Several clinical reports supported the increase in

45

transmissibility associated with the B.1.1.7 VOC with up to a 90% increase in transmission

46

compared to earlier variants (5-7). However, the reported increase in mortality of the B.1.1.7

47

VOC (8-10) seen from earlier COVID case analysis has recently been questioned (11, 12). Apart

48

from clinical studies, experimental infections in animals - ideally in species closely related to

49

humans such as nonhuman primates (NHPs) - is one way to assess transmissibility and disease

50

severity of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

51

The rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection was established early in the pandemic (13-

52

15) and has been used to test SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and vaccines (16-19). Additional NHP

53

species, such as cynomolgus macaques, baboons and marmosets have been investigated for their

54

susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in an attempt to develop models exhibiting increased disease

55

severity (20, 21). None of these models result in severe disease, but susceptible NHP species

56

exhibit oral and nasal shedding and develop mild to moderate respiratory disease in the upper

57

and lower respiratory tract. An African green monkey (AGM) model of SARS-CoV-2 infection

58

has recently been developed, wherein animals show greater severity of disease (22, 23), with

59

intranasal infection of AGMs resulting in significant shedding and respiratory disease (24). The

60

AGM model may thereby represent a more natural NHP model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and

61

disease.

62

In our current study, the AGM intranasal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection was used to assess

63

differences between a contemporary SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant, which was circulating in the

64

summer of 2020, and the B.1.1.7 VOC that emerged in the UK in late 2020. Herein, we report

65

and discuss differences in organ tropism, replication kinetics and shedding between the two

66

SARS-CoV-2 variants.

67

Infection with B.1.1.7 was not associated with a significant increase in disease severity in the

68

AGM model. Following intranasal infection with 1x106 infectious particles of either the SARS-

69

CoV-2 D614G (n=5) or the B.1.1.7 variant (n=6) (5x105 per naris) using a nasal atomization

70

device, animals were monitored and scored daily for clinical signs of disease including changes

71

in general appearance, respiration, food intake and fecal output and locomotion. Clinical signs

72

were mild with both groups of AGMs displaying only minor changes in respiration and showing

73

reduced appetite that negatively impacted volume of feces produced. Slight differences were

74

observed between the two variant groups. B.1.1.7 infected animals had elevated scores early in

75

infection peaking at 2 days post-infection (dpi), which subsequently returned toward baseline

76

(Fig 1A). In contrast, scores for the D614G animals increased slowly peaking at 4dpi and

77

remained stable until euthanasia (Fig 1A, Table S1). Radiographs were taken at each

78

examination and scored for pulmonary infiltrates, progression of which were similar to the

79

clinical scores (Fig 1B, Table S2). B.1.1.7 infected AGMs scored slightly higher earlier and

80

peaked at 1dpi, whereas D614G infected animals scored higher later and peaked at 3dpi. Overall,

81

the changes in clinical and radiographic scores were not significantly different between the two

82

groups even though minor differences were noted in disease progression.

83

B.1.1.7 replication/shedding from the upper respiratory tract was increased compared to

84

D614G. Oral and nasal swabs were taken at each examination to assess virus replication in the

85

upper respiratory tract and virus shedding. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was measured with qPCR assays

86

targeting either total viral RNA (gRNA, N assay) or subgenomic viral RNA (sgRNA, E assay)

87

(Fig 1). Total gRNA in oral swabs was significantly higher at 5dpi in B.1.1.7 compared to

88

D614G infected animals; this difference between variants was maintained but dropped below

89

significance by 7dpi (Fig 1C). There were no significant differences in sgRNA levels in oral

90

swabs at any time point, but levels consistently trended higher in the B.1.1.7 infection group

91

starting at 3dpi (Fig 1D). Although viral RNA was detectable throughout the study, infectious

92

virus was only isolated from oral swabs at 1dpi with significantly higher titers for the D614G

93

infected animals (Fig 1E). Consistent with the oral swabs, higher levels of viral RNA were

94

detected in nasal swabs collected from AGMs infected with B.1.1.7. By 7dpi these animals were

95

all shedding significantly more viral RNA than those infected with D614G (Fig 1F, G).

96

Infectious virus in the nasal swabs was recovered predominantly at 1dpi and there was no

97

difference between groups (Fig 1H).

98

B.1.1.7 replication in the lower respiratory tract was increased compared to D614G. Samples to

99

assess viral replication kinetics in the lower respiratory tract were collected with broncho

100

cytology brushes (BCB) at 3, 5 and 7dpi and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at 3 and 5dpi. Total

101

viral RNA levels were consistent between both sampling methods (~105-107 genome copies/ml)

102

at each day sampled (Fig 2A-C; Fig S1). The gRNA levels were consistently higher in AGMs

103

infected with B.1.1.7 and significantly increased at the final time points of BCB (7dpi) (Fig 2A)

104

and BAL (5dpi) sampling (Fig S1). Although not significantly different at any time point,

105

sgRNA was higher in the B.1.1.7 AGMs at 7dpi in the BCB and in BAL at the final day of

106

collection (5dpi) (Fig 1B; Fig S1). Higher levels of infectious virus were also isolated from

107

animals infected with B.1.1.7, particularly in BCB samples (Fig 2C; Fig. S1).

108

Post-mortem tissues were collected at 7dpi for virological analysis and pathology. Respiratory

109

tissues including nasal turbinate, nasopharynx, trachea and left and right bronchi and a section

110

from each lung lobe were examined for viral RNA and infectious virus. Total and sgRNA was

111

higher in all respiratory tissues in the B.1.1.7 infected animals and was significantly higher in the

112

trachea and bronchi (Fig 2D,E). Although not statistically significant, AGMs infected with

113

B.1.1.7 had higher levels of infectious virus in nasal turbinates, trachea and bronchi (Fig 2F).

114

Consistent with the viral RNA and infectious titer results, most animals (5 out of 6) infected with

115

B.1.1.7 had inflammation of the trachea, with only 1 of 5 animals infected with the D614G

116

variant having any similar observable lesion. Similarly, lesions were found in 8 of 10 bronchi

117

from B.1.1.7 infected AGMs compared to only 2 of 8 of D614G animals, with lesions

118

corresponding to SARS-CoV-2 immunoreactivity by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Fig 2G-N).

119

Total and sgRNA was significantly higher in the lungs of B.1.1.7- compared to D614G-infected

120

animals (Fig 3A, B); however, elevated levels of infectious virus in B.1.1.7 animals remained

121

just below statistical significance (Fig 3C). Lung lesions for both groups were minor but

122

consistent with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and included thickening and inflammation of alveolar

123

septa and the presence of fibrin (Fig 3D-G). SARS-CoV-2 immunoreactivity by IHC was also

124

limited and not directly associated with foci of inflammation (Fig 3H-K).

125

D614G replication in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract was increased compared to B.1.1.7. Total

126

viral gRNA was detected in cervical lymph nodes, tonsil, heart, liver, spleen, ileum and cecum in

127

both groups (Fig 4A). With the exception of one liver sample, sgRNA was not detected in liver,

128

spleen nor kidneys (Fig 4B). Notably and in marked contrast to respiratory tissues, AGMs

129

infected with D614G had significantly more total and sgRNA in the ileum and cecum than

130

B.1.1.7 infected AGMs (Fig 4A, B). Levels of viral RNA corresponded to infectious virus with

131

only D614G animals having detectable infectious SARS-CoV-2 in these two GI-derived tissues

132

(Fig 4C). Similarly, gRNA in rectal swabs peaked and was significantly higher at 7dpi in D614G

133

infected animals (Fig 4D). sgRNA was recovered intermittently across the study (Fig 4E), but

134

infectious virus was recovered from rectal swabs of only one D614G animal (Fig 4F). Viral

135

replication in the ileum was associated with inflammation in D614G infected AGMs and

136

corresponded with detectable viral antigen by IHC (Fig 4G,H,K,L), while AGMs infected with

137

the B.1.1.7 had no observable inflammation or viral antigen (Fig 4I,J,L,M). In D614G infected

138

animals, only one AGM presented with inflammation and a small amount of associated viral

139

antigen in the cecum. No infectious virus was isolated from any of the other non-respiratory

140

tissue in either group and pathology was unremarkable in these tissues.

141

Infection with neither variant was associated with marked changes in hematology, blood

142

chemistry and coagulation, nor a broad systemic cytokine response. Blood and serum samples

143

were collected for hematology, blood chemistry, coagulation assays and cytokine analysis at

144

every clinical examination. No differences were found in the hematology (Fig S2A-L), blood

145

chemistry (Fig S2M-T) or coagulation assays (Fig S3) between the D614G and B.1.1.7 infected

146

AGMs. Of the cytokines examined (Fig. S4), IL6 was the only pro-inflammatory cytokine that

147

was significantly different between the groups, with IL6 being elevated in the D614G group at

148

3dpi and 5dpi compared to B.1.1.7 infected animals (Fig S4A). Levels of T cell chemo-

149

attractants IP-10 (CXCL 10) (Fig S4B) and I-Tac (CXCL 11) (Fig S4) were also increased at

150

1dpi in the D614G group but were not sustained throughout the study.

151

The regular emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants represents a constant public health challenge

152

with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although epidemiological and clinical data can give insight into

153

characteristics of a new variant, this data can be limited initially and may be biased by many

154

factors. Animal models provide the ability to directly compare biological and clinical

155

characteristics of multiple SARS-CoV2 variants in a study with limited variables providing

156

invaluable data otherwise unattainable.

157

In the present study, we have used the AGM intranasal infection model to compare the B.1.1.7

158

VOC, a variant that emerged in the UK in September of 2020 and then quickly spread

159

throughout the world (5, 7), with a contemporary D614G variant, in terms of virus replication,

160

shedding and disease severity. A nasal atomization device was used to infect NHPs to most

161

closely mimic natural infection in human. Following infection with either variant, animals in

162

both groups exhibited minor differences in disease progression but overall disease signs were

163

similar with mild respiratory disease for both B.1.1.7 and D614G (Fig. 1A,B; Table S1 & S2).

164

Increased disease severity was initially reported for human B.1.1.7 cases (8-10), but more recent

165

studies have contradicted these earlier claims (11, 12). The outcome of our study using a NHP

166

surrogate model supports findings from these more recent studies indicating that B.1.1.7 VOC is

167

not associated with increased disease severity.

168

Although no animals in this study developed severe disease, our analysis reveal differences

169

between the two variants in terms of their replication within the respiratory system. Viral RNA

170

and infectious virus in the lower respiratory tract tissues were more prevalent in the animals

171

infected with B.1.1.7 compared to D614G, especially at later timepoints suggesting the

172

development of a stronger respiratory component associated with the emerging VOC (Figs 2, Fig

173

3). Consistent with higher levels of viral replication in the upper respiratory tract, shedding of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.11.448134; this version posted June 13, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

174

viral RNA in both the nose and oral cavity was also higher in B.1.1.7 infected animals (Fig. 1),

175

which support reports from human infection data showing that the B.1.1.7 VOC is more

176

transmissible than earlier variants (6, 7, 25).

177

The pathology associated with infections differed between the two variants. B.1.1.7 replicated at

178

higher levels in the respiratory tract resulting in lesions that were both more numerous and

179

severe than seen for D614G infected animals. In contrast, D614G replicated at higher levels in

180

the GI tract and the associated pathology seen in these animals correlated with this difference in

181

GI replication. This finding was supported by higher levels of viral RNA in rectal swabs

182

indicating the possibility of fecal transmission (Fig. 4). This may indicate that D614G is more

183

suited to replication in the digestive tract than other variants which is in line with clinical studies

184

conducted in early to mid-2020 that reported GI symptoms in approximately 15-20% of COVID-

185

19 patients (26). The difference observed in these studies may also indicate that genetic

186

alterations in B.1.1.7 may have not merely resulted in a general increased rate of replication but

187

may have also altered organ tropism. Clinical studies concerning B.1.1.7 have to date been

188

mainly focused on respiratory symptoms (8-11). However, with clinical studies still underway it

189

remains to be seen whether the observed changes in tissue tropism and replication detected here

190

in the AGM model will correspond to a drop in reported GI symptoms in those infected with the

191

B.1.1.7 VOC compared to infections with contemporary SARS-CoV-2. It is also possible that

192

AGMs may be more prone to GI tract infections and an earlier SARS-CoV-2 study with AGMS

193

using the nCoV-WA1-2020 isolate suggests this could be true. That study had a single animal

194

that exhibited infection in the GI tract up to 10dpi but the remaining animals did not (27). Future

195

studies should address potential differences in organ tropism associated with SARS-CoV-2

196

variants.

197

A recent study posted on a preprint server examining SARS-CoV-2 variants in the rhesus

198

macaque model showed no difference in viral replication nor disease between the D614G and

199

B.1.1.7 variants (28). Notably, this study used double the infectious dose via intranasal challenge

200

using the same atomizing device, but also added an intratracheal inoculation route (28).

201

Although AGMs and rhesus macaques share similar ACE-2/RBD binding affinities (29), we

202

cannot rule out the different NHP species as a potential factor in the outcome of infection. The

203

marginally higher dose and additional route of infection may have been additional factors

204

affecting infection outcomes.

205

In conclusion, our results from the intranasal AGM COVID-19 surrogate model support the most

206

recent data from B.1.1.7 in humans, providing direct empirical data for increased replication in

207

respiratory tissue, but with no enhancement of disease. Although the lack of clear statistical

208

significance for some of the parameters may be regarded as possible limitation of the study, the

209

use of these multiple parameters to independently verify one another addresses this concern. One

210

way to obtain statistical significance more uniformly is to increase NHP numbers something that

211

is ethically sensitive and difficult given the current issues with NHP availability. NHPs remain a

212

surrogate model for humans and results presented herein provide direct experimental evidence

213

that support recent clinical observations, which indicate that the B.1.1.7 VOC has characteristics

214

of increased replication in respiratory tissues with enhanced shedding from the nose and oral

215

cavity resulting in advanced transmission. A further notable and interesting observation of

216

differences between these two variants in terms of distinct viral tissue/organ tropism warrants

217

further attention as such changes would have public health implications in terms of transmission

218

and disease manifestation.

Biosafety and ethics. All SARS-CoV-2 studies were approved by the Institutional Biosafety

3

Committee (IBC) and performed in high biocontainment (BSL3/BSL4) at Rocky Mountain

4

Laboratories (RML), NIAID, NIH. All sample processing in high biocontainment and sample

5

removal followed IBC-approved Standard Operating Protocols (SOPs) (1). All experiments

6

involving AGMs were performed in strict accordance with approved Institutional Animal Care

7

and Use Committee protocols and following recommendations from the Guide for the Care and

8

Use of Laboratory Animals of the Office of Animal Welfare, National Institutes of Health and

9

the Animal Welfare Act of the US Department of Agriculture, in an Association for Assessment

10

and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC)-accredited facility.

11

AGMs were placed in a climate-controlled room with a fixed 12-hour light-dark cycle. Animals

12

were singly housed in adjacent primate cages allowing social interactions and provided with

13

commercial monkey chow, treats, and fruit twice daily with water ad libitum. Environmental

14

enrichment was provided with a variety of human interaction, manipulanda, commercial toys,

15

movies, and music. AGMs were monitored at least twice daily throughout the study.

16

Virus and cells. SARS-CoV-2 isolate SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/RML-7/2020 (MW127503.1),

17

strain D614G, was obtained from a nasopharyngeal swab obtained on July 19, 2020. Sequencing

18

of the viral stock showed it to be 100% identical to the deposited Genbank sequence and no

19

contaminants were detected (2). SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 (hCoV-

20

19/England/204820464/2020, EPI_ISL_683466) was obtained from Public Health England via

21

BEI Resources (Manassas, VA, USA). The supplied passage 2 material was propagated once in

Vero E6 cells. Sequencing confirmed the presence of three SNPs in this stock: nsp6 D156G

23

(present in 14% of all reads), nsp6 L257F (18%) and nsp7 V11I (13%) (3).

24

Virus propagation was performed in Vero E6 cells in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO,

25

USA) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50

26

μg/ml streptomycin (DMEM2). Vero E6 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with

27

10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin

28

(DMEM10). Mycoplasma testing of cell lines and viral stocks is performed regularly, and no

29

mycoplasma was detected.

30

Study design. Eleven SARS-CoV-2 seronegative AGMs (3.8-6.7 kg) were divided into 2 groups

31

for infection with either the contemporary D614G strain (RML7) (n=5) or the recently emerged

32

B.1.1.7 (UK variant) (n=6). A Nasal Mucosal Atomization Device (Teleflex, MAD110) was

33

used to deliver 106 infectious particles (5x105 per naris diluted in 500ul DMEM with no

34

additives). Clinical examinations were performed on days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7. Blood and serum were

35

collected for hematology, blood chemistry, coagulation and virological analysis. Oral, nasal and

36

rectal swabs were collected at every examination for virological analysis. Bronchial cytology

37

brushes were collected on days 3, 5 and 7 and bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were also

38

collected on days 3 and 5 for virological analysis. Tissues were collected following euthanasia

39

on day 7 for pathology and virological analysis. Studies were performed in successive weeks and

40

different animal study groups to avoid contamination between studies, the D416G study was run

41

first followed by the B.1.1.7 study.

42

Virus titration. Virus isolation was performed on tissues following homogenization in 1 mL

43

DMEM using a TissueLyser (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and inoculating Vero E6 cells in

isolation of blood and swab samples were performed in a similar manner. Samples were vortexed

47

for 30 seconds before performing the 1:10 dilution series. The inoculum (200ul) was placed on

48

cells and rocked for 1h. Infectious supernatant was removed and replaced with fresh DMEM.

49

Seven days following inoculation, cytopathogenic effect was scored and the TCID50 was

50

calculated using the Reed-Muench formula (4).

51

Viral RNA detection. qPCR was performed on RNA samples extracted from swabs or tissues

52

using QiaAmp Viral RNA or RNeasy kits, respectively (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). Viral

53

RNA was detected with one-step real-time RT-PCR assays designed to amplify total viral RNA

54

(N gene) (5) or sgRNA by amplifying a region of E gene to detect replicating virus (6). Dilutions

55

of RNA standards counted by droplet digital PCR were run in parallel and used to calculate viral

56

RNA genome copies. A Rotor-Gene probe kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) was used to run

57

the PCRs according to the instructions of the manufacturer.

58

Hematology, Serum Chemistry and Coagulation. Hematology analysis was completed on a

59

ProCyte DX (IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME, USA) and the following parameters were

60

evaluated: red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular

61

volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin

62

concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution weight (RDW), platelets, mean platelet volume

63

(MPV), white blood cells (WBC), neutrophil count (abs and %), lymphocyte count (abs and %),

64

monocyte count (abs and %), eosinophil count (abs and %), and basophil count (abs and %).

65

Serum chemistries were completed on a VetScan VS2 Chemistry Analyzer (Abaxis, Union City,

66

CA, USA) and the following parameters were evaluated: glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN),

67

creatinine, calcium, albumin, total protein, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate

68

aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin, globulin, sodium,

69

potassium, chloride, and total carbon dioxide. Coagulation values were determined from citrated

70

plasma utilizing a STart4 Hemostatis Analyzer and associated testing kits (Diagnostica Stago,

71

Parsippany, NJ, USA).

72

Cytokine analyses. Concentrations of cytokines and chemokines present in the serum from

73

SARS-CoV-2 infected AGMs were quantified using a multiplex bead-based assay (1:4 dilution)-

74

the LEGENDPlex Non-Human Primate Cytokine/Chemokines 13-plex (BioLegend, San Diego,

75

CA USA). Analytes detected by this panel are the following: IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1,

76

MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MIG, TNF-α, I-TAC, RANTES, IP-10, and Eotaxin. Samples were diluted 1:4

77

in duplicate prior to processing according the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were read

78

using the BD FACS Symphony instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA USA) and analyzed

79

using LEGENDplexTM Data Analysis Software following data acquisition.

80

Thoracic radiographs. Ventro-dorsal and right/left lateral radiographs were taken on clinical

81

exam days prior to any other procedures (e.g. bronchoalveolar lavage, nasal flush). Radiographs

82

were evaluated and scored for the presence of pulmonary infiltrates by two board-certified

83

clinical veterinarians according to a previously published standard scoring system (7). Briefly,

84

each lung lobe (upper left, middle left, lower left, upper right, middle right, lower right) was

85

scored individually based on the following criteria: 0 = normal examination; 1 = mild interstitial

86

pulmonary infiltrates; 2 = moderate interstitial pulmonary infiltrates, perhaps with partial cardiac

87

border effacement and small areas of pulmonary consolidation (alveolar patterns and air

88

bronchograms); and 3 = pulmonary consolidation as the primary lung pathology, seen as a

89

progression from grade 2 lung pathology. At study completion, thoracic radiograph findings

90

were reported as a single radiograph score for each animal on each exam day. To obtain this

91

score, the scores assigned to each of the six lung lobes were added together and recorded as the

92

radiograph score for each animal on each exam day. Scores range from 0 to 18 for each animal

93

on each exam day.

94

Histology and Immunohistochemistry. Tissues were fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin

95

with two changes, for a minimum of 7 days according to an IBC-approved SOP. Tissues were

96

processed with a Sakura VIP-6 Tissue Tek, on a 12-hour automated schedule, using a graded

97

series of ethanol, xylene, and PureAffin. Embedded tissues were sectioned at 5 μm and dried

98

overnight at 42°C prior to staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Specific staining was detected

99

using SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody (Sino Biological cat#40143-MM05) at a

100

1:1000 dilution. The tissues were processed for immunohistochemistry using the Discovery

101

Ultra automated stainer (Ventana Medical Systems) with a ChromoMap DAB kit (Roche Tissue

102

Diagnostics cat#760–159) (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN, USA).

103

Statistical analyses. Statistical analysis was performed in Prism 8 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA,

104

USA). Multiple t-tests were used to assess statistical significance between the two infection

105

groups.

Table S2: Radiographic scoring of lungs following infection. Ventro-dorsal and right/left

157

lateral radiographs were taken on clinical exam days prior to any other procedures (e.g.

158

bronchoalveolar lavage, nasal flush). Radiographs were evaluated and scored for the presence of

159

pulmonary infiltrates by two board-certified clinical veterinarians according to a standard scoring

160

system (7). Briefly, each lung lobe (upper left, middle left, lower left, upper right, middle right,

161

lower right) was scored individually based on the following criteria: 0 = normal examination; 1

162

= mild interstitial pulmonary infiltrates; 2 = moderate interstitial pulmonary infiltrates, perhaps

163

with partial cardiac border effacement and small areas of pulmonary consolidation (alveolar

164

patterns and air bronchograms); and 3 = pulmonary consolidation as the primary lung pathology,

165

seen as a progression from grade 2 lung pathology. At study completion, thoracic radiograph

166

findings were reported as a single radiograph score for each animal on each exam day. To obtain

167

this score, the scores assigned to each of the six lung lobes were added together and recorded as

168

the radiograph score for each animal on each exam day. Scores can range from 0 to 18 for each

169

animal on each exam day.
