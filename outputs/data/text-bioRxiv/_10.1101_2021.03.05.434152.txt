Abstract
As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic was
expanding, it was clear that effective testing for the presence of neutralizing antibodies in the blood
of convalescent patients would be critical for development of plasma-based therapeutic
approaches. To address the need for a high-quality neutralization assay against SARS-CoV-2, a
previously established fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA) against Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was modified and optimized. The SARS-CoV-2
FRNA provides a quantitative assessment of a large number of infected cells through use of a
high-content imaging system. Because of this approach, and the fact that it does not involve
subjective interpretation, this assay is more efficient and more accurate than other neutralization
assays. In addition, the ability to set robust acceptance criteria for individual plates and specific
test wells provided further rigor to this assay. Such agile adaptability avails use with multiple virus
variants. By February 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 FRNA had been used to screen over 5,000 samples,
including acute and convalescent plasma or serum samples and therapeutic antibody treatments,
for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers.

1. Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a betacoronavirus with a
positive-strand RNA genome, was identified as a novel pathogen and causative agent of
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in humans. The high transmissibility of the virus has led to a
pandemic with over 110 million documented infections worldwide and over 2.4 million deaths (as
of 22 February 2021).
While initially thought to cause a primarily respiratory disease, time has shown that
SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause multiple clinical manifestations, including severe respiratory
disease, cardiovascular disease [1], and neurological disease [2, 3]. In addition, convalescence in
some people can be complicated by long-term sequelae that can be quite severe [2-4]. Early on,
individuals with pre-existing comorbidities were identified as being more severely affected by
SARS-CoV-2 infection [5, 6], and there are indications that age, gender, race, and other genetic
factors play a role in disease severity and clinical outcome [7, 8].
During acute disease, there appears to be a rapid antibody class switch from immunoglobulin
M (IgM) to IgG and IgA [9, 10], although a slow class switch may be predictive of patient
prognosis and associated with patients requiring hospitalization [11]. The antibody isotype is
important in controlling the disease, and so is the target viral protein. In fact, more robust and
prolonged antibody responses to the viral nucleoprotein (N) were associated with more severe
disease [11].
The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood is presumed to be a good measure of
protective immunity for a vaccine candidate. Hence, methods to reliably, sensitively, and rapidly
detect SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies are needed for pre-clinical vaccine studies and
clinical trials. Further, quantifying potent neutralizing antibodies from recovered COVID-19
patients may be useful in identifying potential donors for passive immunization and
hyper-immunoglobulin therapeutic applications. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
initially approved an Expanded Access Program (EAP) [12] for the treatment of COVID-19
using plasma from individuals with a neutralization titer of 1:160 or higher. This program led to
the treatment of over 94,000 patients at participating provider locations across the U.S. Based on
data from the EAP [13], in August 2020 the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization
(EUA) to allow therapeutic plasma treatment of COVID-19 patients outside the context of

clinical trials [14]. Additional efforts to develop therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have led to
approval of EUAs for antibody cocktails developed by Regeneron [15] and Lilly [16].
Here we describe the development of a semi-high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 neutralization
assay that takes advantage of the capabilities of a high-content imaging system to quantify the
number of infected cells in individual wells. This assay is devoid of subjective interpretation and
more precise than most other wild-type virus neutralization assays. In addition, the assay has
been quickly adapted for use with multiple virus variants.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Virus and Cells
The 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1-A12/2020 human isolate of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Nidovirales: Coronaviridae: Sarbecovirus) was provided by the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, GA, USA). The virus was
propagated at the Integrated Research Facility-Frederick in high containment (biosafety level 3
[BSL-3]) by inoculating Vero cells, acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC
#CCL-81; Manassas, VA, USA). The infected cells were incubated for 72 h in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium with L-glutamine (DMEM; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) containing
2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; SAFC Biosciences, Lenexa, KS, USA) in a
humidified atmosphere at 37°C with 5% carbon dioxide (CO2). The resulting master stock
(IRF0394) was quantified by plaque assay using Vero E6 cells (ATCC #CRL-1586) with a 2.5%
Avicel overlay and stained after 48 h with a 0.2% crystal violet stain. Working stocks (IRF0395
and IRF0399) were prepared using multiplicity of infections (MOI) of 0.01, harvested after 48 h,
and quantified by plaque assay. Virus stocks were sequenced and found to be identical to the
published sequence (GenBank #MT020880) for this isolate.
For the neutralization assay, Vero E6 cells (BEI #NR596; Manassas, VA, USA) were plated
at a density of 3x104 cells per well in 96-well plates and incubated overnight at 37°C with 5% CO2
so they were approximately 80-90% confluent on the day of infection.
2.2. Sample Dilution
The fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA) method for measuring neutralizing
antibodies was originally developed for Ebola virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome

coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [17, 18]. Two changes were made to adapt it to measuring
SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. First, cell culture dilution media without calcium was used to
reduce plasma sample coagulation, particularly when screening plasma samples. Second,
statistical evaluations to allow masking of outlier data were developed.
Different positive controls have been used in this assay depending upon the material being
tested and its application. Most assays were run using a SARS-CoV-2 antiserum (SAB
Biotherapeutics) as a positive neutralizing control, while others used an in-house hyperimmune
anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin. Virus and antibody-free cell culture medium served as a
negative control. During assay development, it was found that there was little difference between
using heat-inactivated or untreated serum or plasma samples. Subsequently, in an effort to decrease
turnaround time, samples were not heat-inactivated and no complement was added. For standard
plasma screening, samples (positive control antibody and test article) were diluted through a
six-step two-fold serial dilution (1:40–1:1280) in serum-free DMEM (Gibco #21068028) using a
96-well plate format (Figure 1A). For studies with higher titer monoclonal antibodies, requiring
precise calculation of a 50% neutralizing titer (NT50), a 12-step two-fold serial dilution
(e.g., 20-40960) was used (Figure 1B). SARS-CoV-2 was diluted in serum-free DMEM to MOI
0.5 (e.g., 15,000 PFU per 30,000 cells). The diluted virus and diluted test samples were mixed 1:1
(vol/vol) and incubated at 37ºC in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere for 1 h to allow
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to bind the virus. The virus/sample mixtures were then transferred
to the wells of a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One #655948) containing Vero E6 cells and incubated
at 37ºC and 5% CO2 for 24 h. For screening activities, samples were tested in duplicate on duplicate
plates to allow for four replicates per tested sample. For full plate dilutions, samples were tested
as a single replicate per plate on four different plates.
All plasma and serum samples used for developing this assay were deidentified donor samples.

2.3. Cell Staining
After 24 h of incubation, cells were fixed by adding 20% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF)
(Thermo Scientific #23-751-800, Kalamazoo, MI) directly to the media for 30 min at room
temperature. Plates were stored approximately 24h in 10% NBF at 4°C in accordance with the
facility’s safety protocols and then removed from the containment laboratory. Following removal
from the laboratory, the NBF was decanted and the cells were washed twice with 1X phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) diluted with purified water from a 10X stock solution (Fisher Scientific
#BP3994). The cells were then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton buffer in 1X PBS (Fisher
Scientific #PR-H5142) for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with
1X PBS prior to blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma #A7906, Saint Louis, MO)
in 1X PBS. Cells were stained with an anti-SARS antibody (SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid antibody, rabbit monoclonal antibody; Sino Biological #40143-R001), diluted to
0.125 µg/mL in 3% BSA/PBS blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were again
washed three times with PBS and then stained with an Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
IgG (H+L) highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific #A11037),
diluted in BSA/PBS for 1 h in the dark at room temperature, and counterstained with Hoechst
33342 nuclear stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific #H3570). The Operetta CLS High-Content Analysis
System (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) was used to count the number of virus-infected and
non-infected cells in wells containing samples/replicates—specifically those in the four internal
(not near well walls) fields with a minimum of 1,000 cells per field.
2.4. Calculation of Standard NT50 Values
For screening relatively low titer samples, a standard dilution scheme of four replicates for
each sample were spread across two plates (Figure 1A). The NT50 value was determined
individually for each set of two plates based on the virus-positive control wells. To determine the
50% infection rate for a plate, the average of 12 observations of positive control wells was
multiplied by 0.50. The output of each step-wise dilution was the average of the four replicates
across two plates. The sample dilution output was compared against the calculated NT50 cutoff
value for the duplicate plates and the highest dilution to achieve an infection of ≤50% was
considered the NT50 titer for the sample. Results are reported as the reciprocal dilution.

105 and is also made available for use under a CC0 license.

2.5. Calculation of NT50 Values by Regression Analysis
For larger dilution series, particularly with known high titer material such as monoclonal
antibodies, a more precise calculation was required. Samples were diluted across the plate
(Figure 1B) with one replicate per plate in four plates. The fluorescence signal was plotted against
the log value of the antibody dilution. A four-parameter logistical analysis was performed on the
full dilution series using Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The regression was
performed using all four replicates per dilution, and the precise titer was calculated from the
regression curve.
2.6. ELISAs
Enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) kits from Euroimmun US, Inc. (#EI 26069601 G) and COVID-SeroIndex from USA R&D Systems, Inc. (#DSR200) were used to test
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity of serum used in FRNA50. The ELISA was performed
according to manufacturer instructions.
Briefly, the EUROIMMUN anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay provides a semi-quantitative in vitro
determination of human antibodies of immunoglobulin classes IgG. Each kit contains microplate
coated with S1 domain of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. In the first reaction step, diluted patient
samples are incubated in the wells. In the case of positive samples, S1-specific antibodies will
bind to the viral antigens. To detect the bound antibodies, a second incubation is carried out
using an enzyme-labelled antihuman IgG (peroxidase conjugate) catalyzing a color reaction.
Results are evaluated semi-quantitatively by calculation of a ratio of the extinction of the control
or patient sample over the extinction of the calibrator. This ratio is interpreted as follows:<0.8
negative; ≥ 0.8 to<1.0 borderline; ≥ 1.1 positive. Borderline results were considered positive for
analysis [19].
The COVID-SeroIndex Kit from R&D which utilizes a recombinant receptor binding domain
(RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Antigen was pre-coated onto a 96-well microplate in
phase 1. When the test sample was added, antibodies specific for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen
bind the antigen and are retained in the well. After washing, an enzyme-linked monoclonal
antibody specific for human IgG is added to the wells. Following a wash to remove any unbound
enzyme-linked antibody, a substrate is added to the wells and color develops in proportion to the

amount of IgG antibodies in the sample bound to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen. The color
development is stopped, and the intensity of the color is measured. The cut off index is
calculated as the ratio of corrected OD of the sample and corrected OD of positive control. The
cut off index is interpreted as follows:<0.7 negative; ≥ 0.7 is positive [20].

3. Results
3.1. Immunofluorescence Staining
Development of immunofluorescence assays for Ebola virus and MERS-CoV [18] established
fundamental protocols. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2020), a primary concern was
identifying a SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody that reacted with this novel virus. Previous work
with MERS-CoV had shown that an N-protein-specific antibody was highly reactive and very
specific. Subsequently, an antibody specific for the SARS-CoV N protein proved to cross-react
with SARS-CoV-2 with no marked evidence of nonspecific binding to cellular proteins (Figure 2).

3.2. Initial Testing of Human Plasma
Initial sample screening protocols were developed to qualify donor samples for clinical trials
supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (Clinical Trials
NCT04344977, NCT04546581). A donor was eligible if their neutralization titer was ≥1:80. To
identify eligible samples, a two-fold serial dilution series was devised to test for titers ranging
1:40–1:1,280. In addition, initial testing evaluated the utility of heat-inactivating the test article
and a possible preference for serum or plasma as a preferred matrix for screening activities. This
testing found that heat-inactivation did not significantly affect testing, and results between serum
and plasma were similar. Thus, in order to retain consistency with the samples that would
ultimately be collected from donors and to decrease processing time, subsequent screening was
performed on plasma that was not heat-inactivated.
Further testing of plasma, serum, purified IgG, monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and mAb
cocktails, polyclonal antibodies and nanobodies has also been completed using this assay. As
appropriate for some samples, the assay employed an alternate dilution series (e.g., 1:20–
1:40,960). The fundamental aspects of the assay were unchanged regardless of the dilution series.
By February 2021, over 5,000 samples had been screened using this assay.
3.3. Outliers in the Virus Control and Cell Control Observations
Early in development of this assay outlier wells in replicate samples of individual dilutions
confounded data analysis. To address concerns with outlier data and to improve plate acceptance
criteria, statistical evaluations were used to identify outliers for exclusion from data analyses and
to define the number of outliers that could be excluded while retaining the viability of the analysis.
The virus positive control consisted of total of 12 observations (six observations on each of
two plates). The virus positive control was used to estimate the NT50, the threshold value used for
detecting efficacy of a sample under specific dilution. The cell-only control also consisted of 12
observations, with six observations per plate; it was used to estimate NT100, another threshold
value. These FRNA criteria determined whether sample readings for a given dilution were
accepted or rejected.

The results of 15 experimental runs (30 plates with 2,280 observations in total) were analyzed.
Box plots were produced from 180 virus control and 180 cell control observations (Figure 3 and
Figure 4).
Placing control data side-by-side helped to visualize extreme results. For, example, in the virus
control box plot results (Figure 3), the measurements of Plate “052020_10-20, Plate 1”, were
concentrated close to 100%. Compared to other observations, these results may have indicated that
this plate was “over-exposed” with the virus cells and the true measurement could not have been
properly estimated. At the same time, extreme values around 0% were observed at plates
“052020_17-33_17-34, Plate 2”, “052120_4-7_4-8, Plate 1”, and “052120_4-7_4-8, Plate 2”. The
question was whether these observations should be discarded or corrected.
The histogram of the virus control observations (Figure 5) showed concentrations above 60%
(mean = 66.8%). The tails of the normal distribution curve were outside of the fixed interval of 0–
100%. To estimate outliers, data were fitted to the beta distribution, which was a more appropriate
choice for values in a finite interval. To estimate beta distribution parameters, the method of
moments1 was used, which allowed the calculation of alpha and beta distributional parameters
using the sample mean and standard deviation. To determine the boundary of acceptable values,
5% and 95% intervals of the beta (2.3, 1.1) were used. Increasing the acceptable region beyond
the cutoffs would have increased the chance of accepting experimental errors and bias the sample
statistics. Removing virus control observations below 24.7% and above 94.6% (outliers) shifted
the sample mean from 66.8% to 67.8%, which improved the precision of detecting the proper
dilution ratio (Figure 6).
The histogram of the cell control observations (Figure 7) showed data that were heavily
skewed toward 0%. Thus, outliers only on the right-hand side were checked. An estimated 95%
boundary of beta (0.3, 7.2)2 or 19.0% as a cutoff interval for control outliers (Figure 8).

we used the scipy.stats.beta.fit() command, a beta-fitting function in the statistical library within Python 3.6 2 [21,22].

When more than three values per plate (out of six) were outside of the acceptable region, it
was recommended to discard results of the entire experimental run (both plates). Using a tailored
algorithm to handle experimental results (Table 2 and Table 3), only one out of 15 runs was
qualified as having faulty controls.

Each level of the sample dilution was repeated four times (twice per plate). To detect potential
experimental errors, the Dixon’s Q test was used as a statistical method to quickly detect gross
errors in small samples [23]. To detect outliers, an algorithm was used to conduct Dixon’s Q test
(Table 4). Here, the critical value of 0.829 was used for a 95% confidence level at N = 4, which is

3.5. Assay Variability
In order to evaluate interassay variability, a high-titer product was tested 14 times with specific
NT50 values calculated. This testing demonstrated an average NT50 of 277 with a standard
deviation of 80 (Table 6).

3.6. Specificity
In order to determine the specificity of the FRNA relative to qualitative total IgG ELISAs, a
small panel of randomly selected samples of pre-determined titers were tested in the FRNA and
two commercially available ELISAs. These comparisons found good agreement between the
FRNA NT50 and ELISA positivity (Table 7). However, there was variability in some samples that
were weakly positive by FRNA NT50. This variability was likely driven, in part, by the relatively
high lower limit of detection (1:40 dilution) used in the FRNA screening assay. If less dilute
samples were tested (e.g., 1:10 or 1:20), the FRNA would probably identify borderline positive
samples.

4. Conclusions
The FRNA is a specific and highly rigorous evaluation for the presence of neutralizing
antibodies in a test sample. Unlike typical neutralization assays, this assay does not rely on the
subjective determination of cell cytopathic effects nor the development of multicellular plaques or
immunofoci using a low number of infectious particles per well. This assay quantifies individual
cells that are infected with the initial addition of virus and does not require multiple rounds of viral
replication. Extensive propagation of virus could confound results due to the presence of
neutralization escape variants in a viral population and secondary infection of neighboring cells
leading to the formation of plaques or foci. The assay described here is also highly quantifiable,
with over 4,000 cells counted per individual sample dilution tested, compared to several hundred
or fewer quantified plaques or foci in other assay types. While this assay is highly quantitative, it
also relies heavily on high-content imaging instrumentation, which may not be available in many
laboratory settings.
The inclusion of statistical evaluation of primary data provides additional rigor and is only
possible due to the large number of quantifiable events recorded in the assay. The ability to “pass”
or “fail” wells or test plates if data fall outside pre-established acceptance criteria provides
confidence that determined titers are accurate. The use of 12-step dilution schemes and
four-parameter logistical analysis to quantify a specific NT50, rather than reporting data as the
reciprocal dilution value, provides a more precise understanding of neutralization capacity,
particularly when evaluating monoclonal antibodies or nanobodies. The calculation of NT50 values
also allows more accurate extrapolation of NT80 or NT90 values based on the calculated NT50 and
the slope of the curve determined from test values.
The use of neutralization data has been critical to identifying potential convalescent plasma
donors for hyper-immune intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) clinical trials. These trials are
evaluating the potential therapeutic benefit of IVIg for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in both
hospitalized and ambulatory patients. Further, considerable effort by the World Health
Organization (WHO) and others has focused on correlating data from a range of
SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISAs to neutralization assays with the objective of understanding both
the diagnostic and predictive value of these and other point-of-care diagnostic tools [24-28]. Due
to requirements to handle wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in a BSL-3 facility, many laboratories have

developed pseudotype-virus neutralization assays using lentivirus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and
other platforms [29]. The advantage of the pseudotype systems is that they can be used at BSL-2
using reporter genes, such as luciferase or a fluorescent protein (e.g., NeonGreen) [10, 29, 30].
Disadvantages of such systems are that they generally only contain the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
and that the arrangement and organization of the virus spike on the pseudotyped-virus surface is
unlikely to be representative of wild-type SARS-CoV-2. In many cases, such as testing plasma or
a polyclonal antibody, the presentation of the spike protein is less of a concern given the array of
antibodies. However, when testing monoclonal antibodies, a pseudotype-virus system could
provide very different results relative to tests with wild-type virus, particularly if stoichiometric
effects or cross-linking between spike proteins is a mechanism used in blocking virus attachment
to the ACE2 receptor or in blocking spike trimer rearrangement as a part of the virus fusion
process. Thus, any monoclonal antibody screened in a pseudotype virus assay should be validated
in a live, wild-type virus assay.
Here, we describe a semi-high throughput highly quantitative neutralization assay for
SARS-CoV-2 built around the Operetta high-content imaging system. While the Operetta is the
preferred platform in our facility, similar equipment could be equally effective if appropriately
validated. While there will always be variability in live-virus assays due to the nature of the
biological system, using a rigorous statistical approach to inform acceptance of data can mitigate
the potential negative effects of poor infection efficiency, pipetting errors, edge effects, and
inconsistent staining.
