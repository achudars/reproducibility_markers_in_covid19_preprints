Summary
RIG-I, a cytoplasmic viral RNA sensor, is crucial for innate antiviral immune responses;
however, there are controversies about RIG-I’s regulatory mechanism by several
ubiquitin ligases and LGP2. Our genetic study revealed that the RIPLET ubiquitin ligase
was a general activating factor for RIG-I signaling, whereas another ubiquitin ligase,
TRIM25, activated RIG-I in a cell-type-specific manner. These RIPLET and TRIM25
functions were modulated by accessory factors, such as ZCCH3C and NLRP12.
Interestingly, we found an additional role of RIPLET in innate immune responses.
RIPLET induced delayed polyubiquitination of LGP, resulting in the attenuation of
excessive cytokine expression at the late phase. Moreover, RIPLET was involved in the
innate immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection, a cause of the recent COVID19 pandemic. Our data indicate that RIPLET fine-tunes innate immune responses via
polyubiquitination of RIG-I and LGP2 against virus infection, including SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
Cytoplasmic viral RNA sensing initiates innate antiviral immune responses, including
type I interferon (IFN) production. RIG-I is a member of the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs)
and senses 5´ tri- and di-phosphate viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)1, 2. Following
viral RNA recognition, RIG-I is associated with the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling
protein (MAVS) adaptor protein localized on the outer membrane of mitochondria
triggering the expression of cytokines, such as type I IFN and other pro-inflammatory
cytokines3. Influenza A virus, hepatitis C virus, Sendai virus (SeV), and vesicular
stomatitis virus are mainly recognized by RIG-I4. RIG-I is an IFN-inducible gene
expressed in various cell types, such as epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages5.
Although RIG-I is crucial for innate antiviral immune responses, excessive RIG-I
activation leads to autoimmune disorders6. Thus, RIG-I should be tightly controlled by
several RIG-I regulators.
The RIG-I protein comprises two caspase activation and recruitment domains
(2CARDs), RNA helicase domain, and C-terminal domain (CTD). The protein harbors
post-translational modifications, and it has been shown that K63-linked polyubiquitin
chains are essential for RIG-I activation7. TRIM25 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that delivers
the K63-linked polyubiquitin moiety to RIG-I 2CARDs7. The polyubiquitin chains
stabilize the 2CARD tetramer structure and promote type I IFN expression8. Recent
studies have identified several TRIM25 regulators. The ZCCHC3 and NDR2 proteins
promote TRIM25-mediated activation of RIG-I, thereby enhancing innate antiviral
immune responses9,

10.

In contrast, NLRP12 inhibits TRIM25 to attenuate RIG-I3

mediated signaling11.
RIPLET is another ubiquitin ligase that mediates K63-linked polyubiquitination of the
CTD and CARDs, and is essential for RIG-I activation12, 13, 14, 15. Although many groups
have reported TRIM25 as essential for RIG-I activation1, several recent studies have
challenged this model and shown that RIPLET, but not TRIM25, is necessary for RIG-Imediated innate immune responses14, 16, 17. Besides these contradictions, the ubiquitin

These apparent contradictions are still

LGP2 and MDA5 are other RLRs involved in innate antiviral immune responses,
including type I IFN expression22. LGP2 was once reported as a negative regulator
because its over-expression attenuates RIG-I-mediated type I IFN expression23. However,
LGP2 knockout (KO) exhibited a defect in RIG-I-mediated type I IFN expression after
viral infection24. LGP2 regulates MDA5 assembly on viral RNA25. It has recently been
shown that an E3 ubiquitin ligase binds to LGP226; however, the role of LGP2
polyubiquitination in RIG-I activation remains unclear.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus causing
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)27. The viral spike protein binds to human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to infect host cells27. The cytoplasmic innate
immune response against SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Since several viruses have
evolved to escape the host innate immune response1, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 can
also suppress the innate immune response.

Here, we focused on the role of RIPLET in RIG-I-mediated cytoplasmic antiviral
innate immune response. Our genetic data showed that RIPLET is a general activating
factor for RIG-I. In contrast, TRIM25 KO exhibited a defect in RIG-I activation in a celltype-specific manner. We also found RIPLET-mediated polyubiquitination of LGP2.
Thus, our data reconcile previous apparent contradictions and indicate that the ubiquitin
ligase RIPLET modulates antiviral innate immune responses via the post-translational
modification of RIG-I and LGP2.

Results
RIPLET KO exhibits severe defects in RIG-I-dependent cytokine expression
Recent studies reported contradictory data related to RIG-I ubiquitination14, 17. To address
this issue, we generated single-KO, double- KO (DKO), and triple-KO (TKO) cells of
TRIM25, RIPLET, MEX3C, and/or TRIM4 using a CRISPR-Cas9 system. We confirmed
that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated KO induced several deletion and insertion mutations in each
gene and that each KO abolished the expression of TRIM25, MEX3C, TRIM4, and
RIPLET (Supplementary Figs. S1a and b). Over-expression of full-length RIG-I leads to
its autoactivation, leading to IFN-β promoter activation12, 13, and we found that RIPLET
KO abolished the full-length RIG-I-mediated IFN-β promoter activation (Fig. 1a). In
contrast, neither TRIM25, MEX3C, nor TRIM4 KO failed to reduce the IFN-β promoter
activities in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1a).
As previously reported7, TRIM25 over-expression markedly enhanced RIG-I CARDsmediated type I IFN promoter activation (Supplementary Fig. S1c); however, RIG-I
CARDs-mediated promoter activities were not reduced in three independently isolated
TRIM25 KO cells (Fig. 1b). We confirmed that endogenous TRIM25 proteins were
undetected in the three independent TRIM25 KO clones (Supplementary Fig. S1d).
MEX3C KO and TRIM4 KO also failed to suppress promoter activities induced by RIGI CARDs, whereas RIPLET KO significantly reduced the promoter activities by the RIGI CARDs (Fig. 1c). TKO of TRIM25, MEX3C, and TRIM4 also failed to mitigate RIG-I
CARDs-mediated type I IFN promoter activation (Fig. 1d). We confirmed that RIPLET
KO did not reduce the promoter activity driven by MAVS over-expression (Fig. 1e),

which weakened the possibility that RIPLET activated the promoter activity in a RIG-Iindependent manner.
Next, we investigated cytokine expression in response to RIG-I activation. RIPLET
KO abolished the expression of IFN-β, IP-10, and Ccl5 mRNA in response to transfection
with short poly I:C, which is a ligand of RIG-I, or Sendai virus (SeV) infection (Figs. 1f1h). In contrast, KO of each TRIM25, MEXC3C, and TRIM4 failed to reduce the
cytokine expression (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Figs. S1e and f). Also, TKO of TRIM25,
TRIM4, and MEX3C failed to reduce the cytokine expression in HEK293 cells (Figs. 1g
and h, and Supplementary Figs. S1g–j). These data weakened the possibility that TRIM25,
MEX3C, and TRIM4 redundantly activated RIG-I to induce type I IFN expression in
HEK293 cells. Since some of the TRIM25, MEX3C, TRIM4 KO, and TKO cells
exhibited enhanced cytokine expression previously observed by Cadena C et al.14, KO of
those E3 ubiquitin ligases might lead to suppressor mutations on other gene (s) by an
unknown mechanism (see discussion).
Defective RIG-I-mediated type I IFN expression was also detected in RIPLET KO
HeLa cells (Fig. 1l). Still, there was no defect in type I IFN expression in TRIM25-KO
HeLa cells (Fig. 1i), suggesting that the observation of no defect of RIG-I signaling in
TRIM25-KO cells was not specific to HEK293 cells. The DKO of TRIM25 and RIPLET
also exhibited a severe defect in short poly I:C-induced expression of IFN-β, IP-10, and
Ccl5 mRNA (Fig. 1j and Supplementary Figs. S2a–c).
Next, we observed the subcellular localization of RIPLET, TRIM25, RIG-I, and K63linked polyubiquitin chains. Proximity ligation assay (PLA) was used to detect the co7

localization of two proteins, and the number of endogenous RIG-I and Riplet colocalization PLA signals was increased after stimulation with short poly I:C (Figs. 1k and
l), which was consistent with the observation that RIPLET binds to RIG-I after
stimulation12. Interestingly, several PLA signals were detected on rhodamine-conjugated
short poly I:C and mitochondria (Supplementary Figs. S2d and e). Co-localization of
RIG-I and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains were also detected by PLA (Fig. 1m). The
number of PLA signals was markedly increased after stimulation with short poly I:C, and
RIPLET KO abolished the signals (Figs. 1m and n). Several PLA signals were localized
on rhodamine-conjugated short poly I:C; however, there were many signals that were not
co-localized with the short poly I:C (Supplemental Fig. S2f), implying that ubiquitinassociated RIG-I detached from the ligands after its activation. Our data collectively
indicate that the RIPlET, but not TRIM25, MEX3C, nor TRIM4, is essential for RIG-I
activation in several cell types, and this notion is consistent with a previous report by
Cadena C et al.14.

Cell-type-specific defects of TRIM25 KO cells in RIG-I activation
Although TRIM25 KO unaffected RIG-I-dependent type I IFN expression in HEK293
and HeLa cells, we found that TRIM25 KO reduced IFN-β mRNA expression in A549
cells at the early phase after stimulation with short poly I:C (Fig. 2a), and IP-10 and Ccl5
expression was also reduced by TRIM25 KO at both the early and late phases (Figs. 2b
and c). Notably, RIPLET KO also abolished the cytokine expression in response to a RIGI ligand even in A549 cells (Figs. 2a–c). TRIM25 KO failed to reduce IFN-β mRNA

expression after SeV infection (Fig. 2d). In contrast, it moderately reduced IP-10 and Ccl5
mRNA expression in response to SeV infection (Figs. 2e and 2f). To further test the defect
of TRIM25 KO in RIG-I activation, we sought to generate additional TRIM25 KO cells
and obtained two A549 TRIM25 KO clones (clone #2 and #9). We found that TRIM25
KO significantly reduced the expression of IP-10 and Ccl5 mRNA in two independently
isolated TRIM25 KO clones in response to short poly I:C stimulation (Figs. 2g–i), and
IP-10 and Ccl5 mRNA expression induced by SeV infection was also reduced in a
TRIM25 KO clones (Fig. 2j). Additionally, Ccl5 mRNA expression was reduced by
TRIM25 KO in SKOV3 cells after SeV infection (Fig. 2k). PLA signals of endogenous
RIG-I and TRIM25 were detected on short poly I:C as was the case with those of RIG-I
and Riplet (Fig. 2l). Considering these data, we prefer the interpretation that TRIM25
activates RIG-I in a cell-type-specific manner (see discussion).
Since recent studies have reported several proteins that regulate TRIM25-mediated
RIG-I activation9, 10, 11, we hypothesized that the expression of these factors might be
required for TRIM25 to activate RIG-I. It has been shown that ZCCHC3 promotes
TRIM25-mediated RIG-I activation10. ZCCHC3 KO moderately reduced RIG-I-mediated
IFN-β and Ccl5 mRNA expression (Supplementary Figs. S2g–i). Although TRIM25 KO
did not show any defect in RIG-I signaling in HEK293 cells as described above, TRIM25
KO reduced RIG-I-induced IFN-β promoter activities in ZCCHC3-overexpressing cells
(Fig. 2m). We confirmed that RIPLET over-expression enhanced ZCCHC3-mediated
RIG-I activation (Supplementary Fig. S2j) and that RIPLET KO abolished RIG-Imediated type I IFN promoter activation, even in ZCCHC3-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2n).

These observations are consistent with the notion that ZCCHC3 promotes TRIM25mediated RIG-I activation.
NDR2 and NLRP12 have been reported to modulate TRIM25-mediated RIG-I
activation9,

11.

However, NDR2 over-expression augmented RIG-I-mediated IFN-β

promoter activation not only in wild-type cells but also in TRIM25 KO cells (Fig. 3a).
Also, NLRP12 over-expression reduced RIG-I-mediated signaling in WT and TRIM25
KO cells (Fig. 3b and 3c). These data suggest that NDR2 and NLRP12 regulate RIG-I
activities in TRIM25-dependent and -independent manners. Thus, we next investigated
the physical interactions between these factors and RIPLET.
Our immunoprecipitation assay showed that RIPLET was co-immunoprecipitated with
NLRP12 (Fig. 3d), and NLRP12 expression reduced the physical interaction between
RIG-I and RIPLET (Fig. 3e). TRIM25 binds to the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of
NLRP1211. Our immunoprecipitation assay with truncated forms of NLRP12 showed that
RIPLET bound to the pyrin domain of NLRP12, and the NBD inhibited the interaction
(Fig. 3f). Moreover, NLRP12 expression inhibited RIPLET-mediated RIG-I
polyubiquitination of RIG-I (Fig. 3g). These data suggest that the accessory factors are
involved in both RIPLET- and TRIM25-mediated RIG-I activations.

RIPLET mediates K63-linked polyubiquitination of LGP2 C-terminal region
Next, we focused on the role of LGP2, because unknown function of LGP2 may underlie
the controversy. LGP2 is a member of the RLRs. Its over-expression reduced RIG-Imediated IFN-β promoter activation but enhanced MDA5-mediated IFN-β promoter

activation (Supplementary Figs. S3a and b). However, LGP2 KO significantly reduced
mRNA expression of IFN-β and IP-10 in response to short poly I:C and SeV infection
(Figs. 4a–d). Since there are similarities between the CTDs of RIG-I and LGP228, we
investigated the physical interaction between RIPLET and LGP2 and found that the
RIPLET protein was co-immunoprecipitated with LGP2 (Figs 4e and f). Additionally,
PLA signals of RIPLET-HA and FLAG-LGP2 were detected (Fig. 4g). Interestingly,

polyubiquitination (Fig. 4h). To investigate whether the modification was K63-linked
polyubiquitination, K63-only ubiquitin, in which all K residues of ubiquitin except K at
63 were replaced with R, was utilized to detect LGP2 ubiquitination. K63-only ubiquitin
was efficiently incorporated into LGP2, and that the polyubiquitin bands were increased
by RIPLET expression (Fig. 4i). Conversely, RIPLET KO reduced the polyubiquitination
of LGP2 (Fig. 4j). The PLA signals of endogenous LGP2 and K63-polyubiquitin were
observed. The number of signals was increased by stimulation with short poly I:C, and
RIPLET KO abolished the PLA signals (Fig. 4k). Additionally, the signals were detected
on transfected rhodamine-short poly I:C (Fig. 4l). These data suggested that RIPLET
mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination of LGP2.
Since the immunoprecipitation assay and PLA suggested that RIPLET ubiquitinated
LGP2, we performed a mass spectrometry analysis to determine the ubiquitination sites
of LGP2. We found that K39, K532, K599, and K629 of LGP2 were ubiquitinated in
RIPLET-expressing cells (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. S3c). The alignment of LGP2
and RIG-I showed that K532 and K599 of LGP2 were comparable with K788 and K851

of RIG-I, which are ubiquitinated by RIPLET (Supplementary Fig. S3d).
Immunoprecipitation assay showed that RIPLET preferentially bound to the helicase
domain of LGP2, although the CTD is also associated with RIPLET (Fig. 5b), which is
consistent with a recent study showing that ubiquitin ligases bind to the helicase domain
of RLRs26. The 3KR amino acid substitutions within the CTD reduced the
polyubiquitination of LGP2 CTD (Fig. 5c), but residual polyubiquitination was still
detected.
To investigate the physiological significance of LGP2 polyubiquitination, we
constructed a LGP2-4KR mutant in which K39, K532, K599, and K629 of LGP2 were
replaced with the R residue. Both non-ubiquitinated and polyubiquitinated wild-type and
LGP2-4KR mutant proteins were recovered by pull-down assay with poly I:C-conjugated
streptavidin beads (Fig. 5d), suggesting that polyubiquitination did not affect the RNAbinding activity of LGP2. To investigate the effect of LGP2 ubiquitination on cytokine
expression, we constructed LGP2 KR mutants. We observed a moderate increase in RIGI-mediated IFN-β promoter activation with the K39R or K532R substitution, and the
K629R mutation significantly increased the promoter activities (Fig. 5e). We generated
cells that stably expressed wild-type LGP2 or LGP2-4KR using a lentivirus vector29.
Stable expression of wild-type or mutant LGP2 unaffected the IFN-β promoter activities
in non-stimulated cells (Fig. 5f). Interestingly, the LGP2-4KR mutant protein induced the
promoter activity more than the wild-type protein in response to a RIG-I ligand (Fig. 5f).
These data suggested that LGP2 ubiquitination negatively affects type I IFN expression.
Next, we determined the mRNA expression of cytokines in response to stimulation

with a RIG-I ligand and SeV infection. The 4KR mutation augmented the cytokine
expression at late time points but not at the early time points (Figs. 6a–f). Time course
analyses showed that the PLA signals of LGP2 and K63-polyubiquitin increased more
slowly than RIG-I and K63-polyubiquitin (Figs. 6g–i). Influenza A virus and SARS-CoV2 are suspected of inducing cytokine storm, in which excessive cytokine production is
harmful to the host30, 31. RIPLET-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination of LGP2 is
expected to attenuate excessive cytokine expression at the late phase.

RIPLET plays a crucial role in innate immune responses against SARS-CoV-2
Studies have shown that RIPLET plays a crucial role in the innate immune response to
viral infection, such as influenza A, vesicular stomatitis virus, Sendai, and hepatitis C
virus12,

32.

Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus causing the COVID-19 pandemic, we

investigated whether RIPLET is involved in the innate immune response to SARS-CoV2.

VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the total RNA of infected
cells was extracted. Extracted RNAs from infected and non-infected cells were
transfected into HEK293 cells, and cytokine expression was measured. Total RNAs from
virus-infected cells but not those from uninfected cells induced cytokine expression (Fig.
7a and Supplementary Figs. S4a and b), suggesting that RNAs of SARS-CoV-2-infected
cells can induce the innate immune response. Interestingly, either RIG-I KO or MDA5
KO markedly reduced cytokine expression in response to viral infected cell RNAs (Fig.
7b). The dependency on both RIG-I and MDA5 has been reported in the response to

Japanese encephalomyelitis virus infection33. Our data are consistent with a recent report
showing that MDA5 plays a crucial role in the innate immune response to SARS-CoV234.
Second, we investigated which viral RNA genome segments are recognized by the
cytoplasmic innate immune system. Contiguous genomic viral RNA segments of SARSCoV-2 were prepared using T7 RNA polymerase shown in Supplemental Fig. S4c. Each
viral RNA segment was transfected into HEK293 cells, and IFN-β mRNA expression was
measured. Interestingly, two viral RNA segments, 24001–2500 and 27001–28000,
significantly induced the type I IFN expression. We found that either RIG-I KO or MDA5
KO was enough to reduce the cytokine expression to the viral RNA segment of SARSCoV-2 (Fig. 7c and Supplementary Figd S4d). Interestingly, RIPLET KO abolished the
cytokine expression in response to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA segment (Figs. 7d–f),
suggesting the crucial role of RIPLET in the innate immune response during SARS-CoV2 infection.
Third, we investigated the cytokine expression after viral infection. Although influenza
A virus or SeV infection at MOI = 1 induced IFN-β mRNA expression, SARS-CoV-2
infection failed to induce the cytokine expression (Fig. 7g–i and Supplementary Fig. S4e).
We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 replicated in HEK293 cells (Fig. 7j). Recent studies
have shown that viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2 can suppress the innate immune responses,
and we also found that several viral proteins suppressed the RIG-I-mediated IFN-β
promoter activation (Supplementary Fig. S4f). To further address the role of RIPLET in
the innate immune response, we generated human ACE2 overexpressing HEK293 cells

(HEK293-ACE2) to increase the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 to HEK293 cells as
previously reported27,

35.

In HEK293-ACE2 cells, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced

moderate expression of type I IFN expression, and RIPLET KO reduced the cytokine
expression (Supplementary Fig. S4g). Interestingly, RIPLET KO significantly increased
the cytoplasmic viral levels after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 7k). Our data collectively
indicate that RIPLET is required for the antiviral innate immune response against SARSCoV-2.

Discussion
RIG-I is a cytoplasmic viral RNA sensor that is essential for innate antiviral immune
responses. Although there is controversy about RIG-I regulators, our data revealed that
RIPLET ubiquitin ligase is a general factor for RIG-I activation, and TRIM25 KO
exhibited a defect in RIG-I activation in a cell-type-specific manner. Moreover, several
accessory factors affected not only TRIM25- but also RIPLET-mediated RIG-I activation.
We also found that RIPLET induced delayed polyubiquitination of LGP2, which
attenuates the excessive cytokine expression. Furthermore, RIPLET was essential for the
antiviral innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2, which is a cause of the recent
COVID-19 pandemic. These data elucidated a crucial role of the RIPLET ubiquitin ligase
in regulating antiviral innate immune responses.
K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I is an essential step to trigger the expression of
type I IFN and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Many studies have reported that

TRIM25 delivers the K63-linked polyubiquitin moiety to RIG-I, thereby inducing type I
IFN expression in vitro and in vivo1. However, recent studies have challenged this
model14, 16, 17. Here, we carefully assessed the ubiquitin ligases’ role using single-, double-,
and triple-KO cells and the obtained data that reconciled the apparent discrepancy. As
reported by Cadena et al., we found that RIPLET KO severely reduced RIG-I-dependent
cytokine expression in any cell type as far as we tested. In contrast, TRIM25 KO
attenuated the RIG-I-dependent cytokine expression only in a cell-type-specific manner.
Considering that TRIM25 has been considered essential for RIG-I activation in any cell
types7, our finding would reconcile previous apparent discrepancy of why TRIM25 KO
exhibited a defect in RIG-I activation in some studies but did not in other studies1, 21.
In addition to RIPLET and TRIM25, MEX3C and TRIM4 were reported to be involved
in RIG-I ubiquitination. Unlike TRIM25 and RIPLET, we could not see any effect of
MEX3C KO or TRIM4 KO on RIG-I activation at least in our experimental conditions.
We do not exclude the possibility that MEX3C and TRIM4 might be required for RIG-I
activation in a cell-type-specific manner, as seen with TRIM25. Recent studies have
reported several factors that regulate TRIM25 functions. Since TRIM25 decreased RIGI-mediated type I IFN expression in HEK293 cells expressing ZCCHC3; it is expected
that some types of immortalized cells lack the factors’ expression required for TRIM25mediated RIG-I activation.
Some of TRIM25 KO, MEX3C KO, and/or TRIM4 KO exhibited enhanced cytokine
expression in response to RIG-I stimulation in our experimental conditions. These
observations were also observed in a previous study by Cadena et al14. Thus, it is

suspected that some suppressor mutations occurred on other unknown genes during the
isolation of those KO cells. Considering that ubiquitin ligases target several proteins, it is
not surprising that suppressor mutations occur in ubiquitin ligase KO cells36, 37. Those
spontaneous suppressor mutations might affect the phenotypes of TRIM25 KO cells.
Thus, we prefer the interpretation that TRIM25 activates RIG-I in a cell-type-specific
manner rather than the model that TRIM25 is not involved in RIG-I activation. Further
studies using TRIM25 KO mice and TRIM25 KO primary cells are required to settle the
dispute.
The decrease in of IP-10 and Ccl5 expression was more significant than that of IFN-β
in TRIM25 KO cells. The MAVS adaptor induces cytokine expression via mitochondria
or peroxisome38. Peroxisomal MAVS preferentially activates the transcription of
interferon-stimulated genes including IP-10, using IRF1 and IRF3, whereas
mitochondrial MAVS activates only IRF3, thereby inducing type I IFN expression38.
Considering that TRIM25 KO exhibited more severe defects in IP-10 and Ccl5 expression
than that of type I IFN, it is possible that TRIM25-mediated polyubiquitin chain
preferentially activates peroxisomal MAVS. Since RIPLET functions as a co-receptor for
RIG-I and an E3 ubiquitin ligase for RIG-I, it is still possible that K63-linked
polyubiquitin chains are important for RIG-I-induced IP-10 and Ccl5 expression, and the
co-receptor function of RIPLET is required for the type I IFN expression. This is also
supported by the notion that the mutations on the ubiquitinated RIG-I residues exhibited
a relatively moderate phenotype compared with RIPLET KO. Further studies are required
to address this issue.

Abnormal activation of RIG-I causes Singleton-Merten syndrome, which is a
multisystem autoimmune disorder, and an excessive innate immune response is harmful
to the host6. We identified an additional role of RIPLET: it mediated K63-linked
polyubiquitination of LGP2, leading to the attenuation of excessive type I IFN expression
at the late phase. LGP2 was once reported as a negative regulator22, 23, but later studies
have shown that LGP2 plays a positive role in RIG-I-mediated cytokine expression24.
This study showed that LGP2 KO reduced RIG-I-mediated cytokine expression, but
inhibition of LGP2 ubiquitination enhanced cytokine expression. These observations
indicate that LGP2 has a dual role in the regulation of RIG-I signaling. This model can
explain why ectopically expressed LGP2 exhibits a negative effect because LGP2 overexpression led to LGP2 polyubiquitination that attenuated RIG-I signaling. K63-linked
polyubiquitination of LGP2 was detected only at the late phase after stimulation of RIGI. Thus, delayed polyubiquitination of LGP2 is expected to be a negative feedback
mechanism to suppress excessive cytokine expression harmful to the host.
Cytokine storm is suspected to be a cause of mortality in patients with COVID-1930.
Indeed, treatment with tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-6, reduces the
mortality of patients with COVID-1939. Therefore, we prefer the interpretation that both
RIPLET-dependent RIG-I and LGP2 ubiquitination would be essential to protect the host
from viral infection. Since SARS-CoV-2 infection hardly induced type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokine expression in HEK293 and HEK293-ACE2 cells, RIPLETdependent cytoplasmic innate immune system seems to be uninvolved in harmful
excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production in patients with COVID-19. Toll-like

receptors, such as TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8, might be involved in excessive proinflammatory cytokine production. We do not exclude the possibility that some kinds of
cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokine via RIPLET-dependent cytoplasmic innate
immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, our observation that several
viral proteins can suppress the cytoplasmic innate immune response weakens this
possibility.
Although there are several contradictory reports related to RIG-I ubiquitination and the
role of LGP2 in innate immune response, our data could reconcile those apparent
discrepancies as discussed above. The molecular mechanism of RIPLET-dependent
regulation of RIG-I and LGP2 would be required to fully understand the intracellular
innate immune responses against viral infections including SARS-CoV-2.

Materials and Methods
Cell Lines
TRIM4-, TRIM25-, MEX3C-, Riplet-, ZCCHC3-, and LGP2-KO cells were generated
using a CRISPR/Cas9 system. The guide sequence (See Table S1) was cloned into a BbsI
restriction site of a pX459 plasmid carrying Cas9 and puromycin resistance genes. The
plasmids carrying the guide sequence and guide sequence were transfected into HEK293,
A549, and HeLa cells. After 36 h of transfection, the cells were treated with 1 µg/mL of
puromycin for 3 days, and then were cultured in fresh medium without puromycin for 2

days. Finally, cells were seeded into 96-well plates and cultured for 7–10 days to obtain
a single clone, which was passed into 24-well plates. Western blotting was performed to
confirm KO of the target gene. To obtain the TKO (TRIM4 KO, TRIM25 KO and
MEX3C KO) HEK293 cell line, TRIM4-KO cells were transfected with pX459 plasmids
carrying TRIM25 guide RNA and single clones were obtained, as described above.
Finally, TRIM4 and TRIM25 KO HEK293 cells were transfected with pX459 plasmids
carrying with the MEX3C guide RNA, and single clones were established using the
abovementioned method.

Constructs
cDNAs encoding full-length ORFs of ZCCHC3, NDR2 and LGP2 were amplified with
cDNA library from HEK293 cells, and were cloned into the KpnI restriction site of pEFBOS using an In-Fusion Cloning Kit (TaKaRa Bio.). A FLAG-tag sequence was inserted
just after the start codon. A cDNA of NLRP12 was amplified with a cDNA library derived
from THP1 cells and was cloned into the KpnI restriction site of pEF-BOS using an InFusion Cloning Kit. A FLAG-tag sequence was inserted just after the start codon. To
obtain a Myc-tagged NLRP12 expression vector, the ORF of NLRP12 was amplified
from the pEF-BOS-FLAG-NLRP12 vector and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI
restriction site of pCDNA3 using an In-Fusion Cloning Kit. A Myc-tag sequence was
inserted into just before the stop codon. Truncation mutants of NLRP12 and LGP2 were
amplified with abovementhoned constructed plasmids and cloned into the KpnI

inserted just after the start codon. The KR mutations were introduced into the LGP2 gene
on the expression plasmid using overlapped forward and reverse primers. Full-length
LGP2 KR mutants were amplified using two fragments as templates and cloned into the
pEF-BOS-FLAG vector.

Cell cultures and viruses
HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM (low Glc) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FCS and penicillin-streptomycin solution. HEK293FT and A549 cells were
incubated in DMEM (high Glc) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS and
penicillin-streptomycin solution. HeLa cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated FCS and penicillin-streptomycin solution. These cells were grown
in a humidified incubator maintained at an atmosphere 5 % CO2. SeV was amplified using
Vero cells, and the number of plaque-forming units was determined by a plaque assay.
The cells were infected with SeV at a multiplicity of infection of 5 to determine the
cytokine expression after SeV infection. SARS-CoV-2 was kindly provided from national
institute of infectious diseases in Japan

RNA polymerase. The viral RNA segment (5001–6000) was not able to be amplified by
unknown reason. The experiments using SARS-CoV-2 were performed in BSL3 level
facilities according to approved protocols in Kumamoto University.

Western blot analysis
Cells were washed with PBS and lysed with NP-40 lysis buffer (20 mM tris-HCl [pH7.5],
125 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol, 1% NP-40, 30 mM NaF, and 5 mM Na3VO4)
in the presence of complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). The cell lysates were
incubated on ice for 30 min and were then centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 rpm at 4°C.
The supernatants were transferred to 1.5 ml tubes and suspended in 2 x Laemmil sample
buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. The cell lysates were boiled for 5 min at 95°C. All
samples and a protein marker (Bio-Rad) were each loaded into separate wells for SDSPAGE in a tris-glycine-SDS buffer before being transferred onto PVDF membranes. The
membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in rinse buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 10 mM
Tris-HCl [pH7.5], 0.8% NaCl, and 1mM EDTA) and was incubated with 1st Ab (1:1,000)
at 4 °C overnight, and then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary Ab (1:10,000) for
60 min at room temperature. The immunoblots were visualized with ECL Prime Western
Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare) and detected using a ChemiDoc Touch
Imaging System (Bio-Rad).

Immunoprecipitation

then performed transfection with expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000. The total
amount of plasmids was maintained at 1 µg by adding empty plasmids. The cells were
harvested and washed with PBS after 24 h of transfection, and then lysed with lysis buffer
containing protease inhibitor cocktail. The cell lysates were kept on ice for 30 min and
were then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred
into 1.5 ml tubes. The lysates were pre-treated with protein G sepharose beads at 4°C for
60 min with rotation and then centrifuged to deplete the protein G sepharose beads. AntiFLAG (1:150) Ab was added to the cell lysates, and then the lysate was incubated for 2
hours at 4 °C with rotation. Washed protein G sepharose beads were added into the lysates
containing the Ab, and incubated overnight with rotation. Then, the protein G sepharose
beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer. The
precipitated samples were analyzed using western blots.

PLA
HEK293 and A549 cells seeded on a glass-bottom plate were fixed with 4% PFA for 15
min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X100 in PBS for 60 min at
room temperature. Subsequently, the PLA signals were detected by a Duolink In Situ PLA
Kit (Sigma-Aldrich), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the cells were
blocked with blocking buffer and were labeled with primary Ab and incubated with
ligation solution to hybridize the positive and negative probes. The cells were incubated
with green or red PLA detection reagent to initiate DNA synthesis with dye-conjugated
nucleotides. The indicated number of cells were randomly chosen and observed under

cells and the number of PLA signals in on cell.

Reporter gene assay
We seeded 1 x 105 of HEK293 cells into 24-well plates in triplicate and transfected the
cells with an expression vector together with p-125 Luc reporter (100 ng/well) and phRLTK (10 ng/well, Promega) plasmids. The phRL-TK (HSV-thymidine kinase promoter)
plasmid encodes Renilla luciferase and was used as an internal control. An empty plasmid
was added to ensure that each transfection received the same amount of total DNA. After
24 h of transfection, luciferase assays were performed using a Dual Luciferase Assay Kit
(Progemga). Luciferase activity was normalized to that of Renilla luciferase.

Quantitative real-time PCR
We seeded 1 x 105 of HEK293 cells into 24-well plates. Then, the cells were transfected
with 100 ng of short poly I:C using Lipofectamine 2000 to determine cytokine expression
after stimulation. Total RNA was isolated form the cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen),
according to the manufacture’s protocol. cDNA was generated from the total RNA using
a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applined Biosystems). The target
mRNA was quantified with Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) using
the ViiA-7 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), and the expression levels were
normalized to GAPDH.

Lentivirus production
HEK293FT cells (2 x 106) were seeded on a 10 cm dish and incubated at 37°C for 1 day.
GFP, LGP2 and LGP2 4KR ORFs were cloned into a FUIPW lentiviral vector and cotransfected with packaging plasmids into HEK293FT cells. After 3 days of transfection,
the viruses were harvested and filtered (0.22 µm filter, Millipore) and used to infect
HEK293 cells in the presence of polybrene (10 µg/ml). The infected cells were selected
with the application of puromycine (1 µg/ml) for 3 days. Human ACE2 cDNA clone was
synthesizes using HepG2 total RNA. The expression of ACE2 in HEK293 ACE2 cells
was confirmed by RT-qPCR.

Nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
FLAG-tagged LGP2 and Riplet expression vectors were transfected into HEK293 cells.
After 24 h of transfection, the cell lysate was prepared, and LGP2 was purified using antiFLAG monoclonal Abs. The isolated LGP2 was subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with
CBB. LGP2 bands were excised from the gel. Then, the proteins in each gel slice were
subjected to reduction with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DDT), at 56 °C for 1 h, alkylation with
55 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 45 min in the dark, and digestion with 10
µg/ml modified trypsin (Promega) at 37°C for 16 h. The resulting peptides were extracted
with 1% trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile, dried under a vacuum, and dissolved
in 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. The peptides were then fractionated by C18
reverse-phase chromatography (Advance Nanoflow UHPLC System; AMR Inc.) and
applied directly into a hybrid linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro;

source. The mass spectrometer was programmed to perform 11 successive scans, with the
first consisting of a full MS scan from 350–1,800 m/z by FT-ICR at a resolution of 60,000.
Scans 2–11 were of data-dependent scans of the top ten abundant ions obtained in the first
scan, by ion trap. Automatic MS/MS spectra were obtained from the highest peak in each
scan by setting the relative collision energy to 35% and the exclusion time to 20 s for
molecules in the same m/z value range. The molecular masses of the resulting peptides
were searched against the Uniprot Proteome Homo sapiens database (downloaded
