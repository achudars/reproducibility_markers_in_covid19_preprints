ABSTRACT
Extracting and processing information from documents is of great importance as lots of experimental results
and findings are stored in local files. Therefore, extracting and analysing biomedical terms from such files
in an automated way is absolutely necessary. In this article, we present OnTheFly2.0, a web application for
extracting biomedical entities from individual files such as plain texts, Office documents, PDF files or
images. OnTheFly2.0 can generate informative summaries in popup windows containing knowledge related
to the identified terms along with links to various databases. It uses the EXTRACT tagging service to
perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) for genes/proteins, chemical compounds, organisms, tissues,
environments, diseases, phenotypes and Gene Ontology terms. Multiple files can be analysed, whereas
identified terms such as proteins or genes can be explored through functional enrichment analysis or be
associated with diseases and PubMed entries. Finally, protein-protein and protein-chemical networks can
be generated with the use of STRING and STITCH services. To demonstrate its capacity for knowledge
discovery, we interrogated published meta-analyses of clinical biomarkers of severe COVID-19 and
uncovered inflammatory and senescence pathways that impact disease pathogenesis. OnTheFly2.0
currently supports 197 species and is available at http://onthefly.pavlopouloslab.info.

INTRODUCTION
The extraction and processing of information from literature is of paramount importance in biomedical
sciences. More often than not, researchers need to cope with the task of manually sifting through large
amounts of text in various forms (e.g., scientific articles in various file formats, data in spreadsheets and
images) in order to obtain pertinent biological information about genes, proteins, chemical compounds,
organisms and biological processes and functions. The manual approach is summarized as follows; i) read
through the article texts, ii) detect biomedical entities of interest, and iii) query one or more databases for
the relevant information. As the volume of literature and experiment-derived datasets continues to increase,
this iterative procedure can become slow and heavy. For this reason, text-mining methods are often
employed to aid researchers in automatically extracting and searching meaningful biological terms from
texts.
One particular application of text mining that is widely used in scientific text processing, is Named
Entity Recognition (NER), i.e., identifying words or phrases of interest (the so-called “named entities”)
mentioned in plain text, and normalizing them to appropriate database/ontology identifiers (1). In biological
and biomedical sciences, these entities include gene and protein names, organisms (scientific or common
names), chemical compounds, and ontology terms such as biological processes, cellular components,
molecular functions, diseases, phenotypes, and environmental descriptors. Numerous computational tools
and web services for NER have been proposed (reviewed in (2–4)). Characteristic examples include tools
like EXTRACT (5), PubTator (6), HunFlair (7), BioTextQuest+ (8), Saber (9), OGER++ (10) and others.
Altogether, these tools detect genes/proteins, genetic variants, diseases, chemical compounds, organisms,
diseases and cell lines mentioned in documents. However, while being able to successfully identify entities
is critical, NER is only one of the components for meaningful parsing and analysis of the scientific literature.
The result of running NER on a set of documents will be a long list of genes and other entities, which the
user then needs to navigate and make sense of.
Network visualization is one popular way to get an overview of a large number of entities.
Molecular networks can be obtained from a wide variety of different sources, including manually curated
pathway databases, e.g., KEGG (11) and Reactome (12), and databases of interaction experiments, e.g.,
IntAct (13) and BioGRID (14). Resources like STRING (15) and STITCH (16) combine these with additional
associations that are predicted or extracted from the biomedical literature through automatic text mining
(17). All of these resources can be queried manually by the user, or automatically through Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs), packages or plugins. Their results can be used to generate, visualize and
analyze interaction networks with network viewers such as Cytoscape (18), Gephi (19), NORMA (20) and
others (reviewed (21, 22)).
Functional enrichment analysis is another commonly used approach, which summarizes a long
list of genes by comparing it to a collection of gene sets, each representing a Gene Ontology term,
molecular pathway, protein domain, disease, etc. Statistically enriched gene sets are then identified by
comparing their frequency against a reference background list of genes. Widely used tools for enrichment
analysis include DAVID (23), PANTHER (24), WebGestalt (25), aGOtool (26) and g:Profiler (27, 28), each
adopting different statistical tests and supporting different enrichment options (reviewed in (29, 30)).
In this article, we present OnTheFly2.0, a full, user-friendly pipeline which goes far beyond just
applying NER and allows users to start from a collection of documents and, via a set of entities, perform
network and enrichment analyses. Through a user-friendly, interactive web interface, OnTheFly2.0 supports
a plethora of different file formats for text mining and biomedical entity extraction, including text documents
(in both editable and read-only formats), spreadsheets and image files. Through NER, OnTheFly 2.0 can
recognize and retrieve a large variety of both biological/biomedical terms. Extracted protein and chemical
entities can be combined to create datasets for various types of analyses, including functional enrichment,
related literature finding, associations with diseases and protein domain reporting from protein family
databases. In addition, OnTheFly2.0 allows the generation and visualization of protein-protein and proteinchemical interaction networks. The capabilities of OnTheFly 2.0 are shown using a case study in which

several inflammatory and senescence pathways that impact COVID-19 pathogenesis have been unraveled
after analyzing six clinical articles with mentions to clinical biomarkers of severe COVID-19.

MATERIALS & METHODS
The OnTheFly2.0 pipeline consists of four steps (Figure 1): i) uploading of input files and conversion from
their original format to HTML, ii) identification of bioentities with EXTRACT, iii) functional annotation on a
set of selected identifiers and iv) network analysis. A detailed description of these steps is provided in the
following subsections.

File conversion pipeline
In its current version, OnTheFly2.0 supports annotation for PDF files, Office-formatted documents, flat text
files and images. In the online version, each file must have a maximum size of 10MBs. Users can upload
multiple files simultaneously and process them separately or in combination.
OnTheFly2.0 uses various tools and pipelines in its backend to convert uploaded files to HTML
format prior to annotation, maintaining overall layout, text formatting, formulas and images to the extent
possible. PDF files are converted with the use of pdf2htmlEX, an open-source package (31), whereas the
LibreOffice universal converter (unoconv) is used to convert Office files, including formatted/enriched text
files (MS Office .doc/.docx, OpenOffice .odt, Rich Text Format .rtf) and spreadsheets (MS Excel .xls/xlsx,
OpenOffice Spreadsheet .odp), tab- and comma-delimited table files (.tsv and .csv, respectively) as well as
flat text (.txt) files. Notably, in the case of spreadsheet files, the converter is capable of handling each of
the sheets.
In addition to the above, OnTheFly2.0 can utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) scan on
images with no text encoding. Both common (.bmp, .jpg, .png, .tiff) and PostScript-compliant image file
formats (.ps and .eps) are supported. Image preprocessing and file format conversion is performed with the
open-source package ImageMagick. OCR scanning of images is performed using the tesseract-ocr
package (32) to produce PDF files with parseable text, which are then processed as described above.
Successful OCR scanning heavily depends on the quality of the imported image, including its resolution.
As a result, images containing text elements in rotated orientation or embedded in complex graphical
shapes, or images with low resolution may result in poor OCR results.
After files have been uploaded and converted, the resulting HTML version can be inspected in a
viewer that has each document in a separate tab. This allows the user to identify conversion or OCR
problems before continuing the analysis.

analysis.

Document annotation using Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Once the files have been uploaded, users can annotate them with the help of EXTRACT tagging service
(5). EXTRACT performs dictionary-based NER using the highly efficient tagger software (33) to detect
words and phrases, which correspond to biomedical entities. In detail, EXTRACT is capable of identifying
environment descriptive terms from Environment Ontology (e.g., desert, forest) (34), organism mentions
from NCBI Taxonomy (35), tissue terms from BRENDA Tissue Ontology (36), disease mentions from
Disease Ontology (37), phenotypes from Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (38), biological processes,
cellular components, molecular functions from Gene Ontology (39, 40), small chemical molecules from
PubChem (41), non-coding RNAs from RAIN (42), and protein-coding genes from STRING (15). In the
implementation of OnTheFly2.0, NER can be performed for a list of 197 organisms.
Once the annotation parameters (entity types and organisms) have been set and a NER process
has been completed, OnTheFly2.0 will return the annotated document with all of the recognized terms linked
and highlighted using different colors (Figure 2). On mouse-click action on a term, OnTheFly2.0 will generate
a popup window with details about the biomedical entity and links to external databases. In case of term
disambiguation (e.g., when a term comes from several organisms or corresponds to more than one entity
type), OnTheFly2.0 will report all of the possible options. For a more comprehensive summary, all of the
identified terms along with their database identifiers and links are collected in an interactive table and can
be exported as a CSV file. The table results can be narrowed down after filtering for entity type (e.g.,
genes/proteins, diseases) at any stage. The annotation process is presented in Figure 2.

Functional enrichment analysis
OnTheFly2.0 uses two tools, g:Profiler (27, 28) and aGOtool (26), to provide rich functional enrichment
analysis for a selected set of genes/proteins collected by one or multiple files. The user can customize
parameters for the enrichment analysis and choose from a list of 197 organisms. OnTheFly 2.0 uses g:Profiler
to identify enriched functional terms from Gene Ontology (39, 40), pathways from KEGG (11), Reactome
(12) and WikiPathways (44), protein complexes from CORUM (45), expression data from Human Protein
Atlas (46), regulatory motifs from TRANSFAC (47) and miRTarBase (48), and phenotypes from the Human
Phenotype Ontology (49). The analysis results from g:Profiler are complemented by further enrichment
analyses from aGOtool to also identify enriched terms from the UniProt keyword classification system,
protein families and domains from Pfam (50) and InterPro (51), as well as human diseases from the
DISEASES database (52). g:Profiler and aGOtool test for statistically significant enrichment by using
Fisher’s exact test to compare the user-defined input dataset (foreground) to a background set from
organism-specific genes annotated in the Ensembl database (53) and UniProt Reference Proteomes (54),
respectively. The resulting p-values are corrected for multiple testing using either g:SCS (only in case of
g:Profiler), Bonferroni correction or Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR), all of which can be
used as thresholds for the results. Enrichment analysis is performed using ENSEMBL IDs as input, while
results can be reported as Entrez, UniProt, EMBL, ENSEMBL and RefSeq gene/protein names/identifiers,
based on the user’s choice.
Functional enrichment results are reported in interactive searchable tables displaying details about
each functional term. One can expand each row of the table to see which of the identified genes/proteins
were found to be associated with the functional term. For example, in the case of a KEGG pathway, one
can see how many proteins or genes were found to be related to it and get redirected to the KEGG

repository to see the actual schema of the pathway in a static form with all of the detected genes/proteins
highlighted. In case of g:Profiler, an interactive Manhattan plot is offered for a clearer overview. In this plot,
functional terms are grouped along the x-axis and colored by their data source, whereas the y-axis shows
the significance (p-value) of each term. Hovering over a data point reveals a tooltip with key information
about the functional term. Finally, the most significant functional terms are shown as a bar chart, which the
user can customize to show the desired number of terms. All of the aforementioned reports can be exported
and saved in various file formats (CSV, XLS, PDF). An overview is shown in Figure 3.

Publication enrichment analysis
OnTheFly2.0 uses the aGOtool to allow users to find scientific articles that mention surprisingly many of the
genes/proteins identified in the uploaded input files. While conceptually similar to the functional enrichment
analyses just described, publication enrichment analysis serves a very different purpose, namely to help
the user identify scientific publications of relevance to the gene/protein list. The publication enrichment
analysis in aGOtool is based on a text corpus of all PubMed abstracts and full-text articles from the PubMed
Central Open Access subset. These have been run through the same NER tagger used in EXTRACT and
the results are updated with new documents on a weekly basis. Consequently, all documents have been
automatically annotated with the genes mentioned within them, thus turning every document into a gene
set. These millions of gene sets are then used by aGOtool in the same manner as all other gene sets.
We make use of this functionality to provide publication enrichment functionality in OnTheFly2.0 for
the list of 197 organisms. The user can select up to 1,000 of the genes/proteins identified in the uploaded
files for analysis, which will then be submitted to aGOtool to test each document from the precomputed

corpus for statistically significant enrichment, again using Fisher’s exact test. The resulting p-values as well
as Bonferroni-corrected p-values and Benjamini-Hochberg FDR values can be used for filtering the results.
Results are reported in interactive searchable tables displaying details about each literature term (scientific
publication or disease). Links are provided for publications and diseases to PubMed. In addition, users are
able to rank the most significant publications using barchart plots and manually adjust the number of the
reported results with the use of a slide bar. All of the aforementioned reports can be exported and saved in
various file formats (CSV, XLS, PDF).

Network analysis
In addition to the aforementioned enrichment options, OnTheFly 2.0 offers the capability to construct and
visualize biomolecular interaction networks for a set of 197 organisms. This task is performed using the
APIs of the STRING (15) and STITCH (16) databases for protein-protein and protein-chemical interactions,
respectively. The users may submit their dataset obtained from the uploaded documents to retrieve
interactions and visualize the results as networks with the interacting entities presented as nodes and their
interactions as edges. For computational efficiency reasons, in its current version, OnTheFly2.0 allows a
maximum of 500 proteins per request for STRING and 100 proteins or small molecules per request for
STITCH.
STRING and STITCH classify interactions between two entities (proteins or small molecules) as
either physical (i.e., part of the same biomolecular complex), or functional (i.e., involved in the same
pathway/process). To this end, OnTheFly2.0 requires users to select whether to include the Full set of
interactions (both physical and functional) or the Physical subnetwork exclusively. Users can also specify
the cutoff on the Interaction Score. Finally, users can choose whether each edge should show the type(s)
of evidence (e.g., experiments or text mining) supporting it (Evidence mode) or if the thickness of the edge
should instead show the interaction score (Confidence mode).
In addition to the above, in protein-chemical networks network edges can be formatted based on
Molecular Action or Binding Affinity. By choosing Molecular Action, the edges in the network will represent
the type (activation, inhibition, catalysis etc.) as well as the effect (positive, negative or unspecified) of each
protein-chemical interaction. By choosing Binding Affinity, the edge thickness will indicate the binding
affinity between the proteins and bound chemicals. The resulting network is shown in a separate Network
Viewer panel, preserving the characteristic STRING network layout and style. An example of such networks
is shown in Suppl. Fig. 1. In addition, options are given to view the generated network in STRING (proteinprotein) or STITCH (protein-chemical) for further analysis. Finally, one can export a network as an image
or as a tab-delimited file compatible with external network visualization applications.

Implementation
OnTheFly2.0 is a web application implemented in R, using the R/Shiny package as well as HTML, CSS and
JavaScript. The Shiny and ShinyJS packages are used as mediators to establish the connection between
the R and JavaScript functions. The API of the EXTRACT web service which utilizes the tagger text mining
utility, is used to perform NER. Functional enrichment analysis is performed using the g:Profiler2 package
(R implementation of g:Profiler) and aGOtool. Biological networks are constructed and visualized using the
STRING API, as implemented in the STRING and STITCH databases. OnTheFly 2.0 is available as a web
service, and as a standalone package through a GitHub repository. The standalone version is fully
functional in native Linux and other Unix-based operating systems. It can also run on Windows, by utilizing
a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or other similar compatibility layers (e.g., Cygwin). The web service
is fully functional in all major web browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Tor, Apple
Safari, Opera).

CASE STUDY
To demonstrate the capacity of OnTheFly2.0 for rapid extraction of biological information and knowledge
discovery, we analyzed six published meta-analysis reports on clinical biomarkers of severe COVID-19
(55–60) (Suppl. Table 1). Texts in PDF format were annotated by NER, results filtered to manually remove
false positives and jointly processed for functional enrichment analysis. Reassuringly, we found
“Respiratory failure”, “Pneumonia” and “COVID-19” to be among the most significantly enriched diseases
(Suppl. Table 2). The GO enrichment for biological processes (Suppl. Table 3) identified several GO terms
related to inflammation, cell activation and response to stress, in line with COVID-19 being associated with
exaggerated lung inflammation and systemic immune dysfunction. Similarly, the annotated text terms were
found to be enriched for molecular functions that are associated with cytokine activity and cytokine receptor
signaling (Suppl. Table 4). These results were supported by the UniProt keyword analysis, which revealed
“Cytokine”, “Inflammatory response”, “Host-virus interaction”, and “Host cell receptor for virus entry” to all
be enriched (Suppl. Table 5). Analysis of putative protein-protein interactions (physical and functional
associations) through the STRING option of OnTheFly 2.0 uncovered a cluster of interacting cytokines and
other immune components that is pertinent to the “cytokine storm” of severe COVID-19 (Figure 4).
Cytokines are also a recurring theme in the publication enrichment results, which as one would hope further
included several COVID-19 studies (Suppl. Table 6).
Cellular/extracellular components predicted to be associated with biomarkers of severe COVID-19
included extracellular space (GO:0005615, GO:0005576), plasma membrane (GO:0009897, GO:0009986,
GO:0098552) and, interestingly, membrane microdomains (also called “membrane rafts”; GO:0098857,
GO:0045121) (Suppl. Table 7). The latter emerge as important cellular components implicated in i) the
initial binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptor, ii) virus internalization and iii) cell-to-cell transmission
(reviewed in (61)). Pertinent to knowledge discovery, this biological information was extracted in the
absence of specific reference to membrane microdomains in any of the six meta-analysis reports that were
interrogated.
Several relevant KEGG pathways were also extracted (Suppl. Table 8), including “coronavirus
disease - COVID-19” (KEGG: 05171; Suppl. Fig. 2), “viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine
receptor” (KEGG: 04061) and “cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction” (KEGG: 04060). Interestingly,
“Yersinia infection” (KEGG: 05135) was also identified as a relevant KEGG pathway with high probability
(p-value<10-8). Yersinia pestis is the causative pathogen for pneumonic plague, one of the world’s deadliest
infectious diseases. Yersinia pestis infects pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages, triggering
inflammasome-mediated IL-1β/IL-18 cytokine release (62) that is followed by neutrophil influx, exaggerated
inflammation and lung tissue damage (63). These immune and lung tissue reactions to Yersinia pestis are
reminiscent of those to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (61) and warrant further insights into the
immunological mechanisms of response to these unrelated pathogens. Of additional interest is the
predicted involvement of the “IL-17 signaling pathway” (KEGG: 04657) in severe COVID-19 (Suppl. Table
8) which is supported by a recent study reporting T cell skewing towards Th17, a specialized CD4 + effector
T cell lineage characterized by secretion of IL-17 and IL-17F cytokines in patients with COVID-19
pneumonia (64).
We also explored the REACTOME option of OnTheFly 2.0 to map and analyze biological pathways
that are over-represented in the validation example. As shown in Suppl. Table 9, several cytokine pathways
were predicted to be significantly associated with biomarkers of severe COVID-19. We note that predicted
REACTOME pathways included “cellular senescence” despite the absence of specific references to this
biological term in any of the six annotated meta-analysis reports under study. In line with this prediction,
COVID-19 pneumonia has recently been associated with immunosenescence (64) and accelerated aging
of pneumocytes (65). Overall, the aforementioned analyses underscore the practical utility of OnTheFly 2.0
to rapidly extract biological information from texts and hence assisting knowledge discovery (Figure 4).

DISCUSSION
OnTheFly2.0 has been redeveloped to use current technologies and overcome many of the problems of its
predecessor (66). The GUI has been completely rewritten to no longer rely on a Java applet and instead
using R, Shiny, CSS, HTML and JavaScript technologies. The backend document format conversion has
also been considerably improved, replacing commercial Windows-based converters with open-source,
Unix-based ones, which furthermore do a much better job preserving the original document layout.
Moreover, compared to its predecessor, OnTheFly 2.0 comes with a broader spectrum of term types it can
identify and supports OCR technology for processing images. Uploaded files are only stored temporarily in
the OnTheFly2.0 server just for parsing and no file backups, copies or personal data are kept. A more
detailed comparison between OnTheFly1.0 and OnTheFly2.0 is presented in Table 1.

OnTheFly2.0 is a powerful tool for identifying terms in locally stored documents varying from texts and PDFs
to Office and image files. Users can identify terms such as proteins, genes, chemical compounds,
organisms, tissues, environments, diseases, phenotypes and gene ontologies and perform a functional
enrichment and network analysis upon selecting a set of biomedical entities. Furthermore, popup windows
with informative summaries about a term and its links to external repositories are also generated.
OnTheFly2.0 can aid researchers in annotating locally stored documents and further exploring and analysing
their identified biomedical entities in a fully automated way. We believe that due to its offered capabilities
and ease of use, OnTheFly2.0 will reach a broad spectrum of users varying from experimentalists to
bioinformaticians.

AVAILABILITY
OnTheFly2.0 is available at: http://onthefly.pavlopouloslab.info or http://bib.fleming.gr:3838/OnTheFly/.
