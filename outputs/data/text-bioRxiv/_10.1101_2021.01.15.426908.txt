Summary: Recently, a short, interferon-inducible isoform of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2
(ACE2), dACE2 was identified. ACE2 is a SARS-Cov-2 receptor and changes in its renal expression
have been linked to several human nephropathies. These changes were never analyzed in context
of dACE2, as its expression was not investigated in the kidney. We used Human Primary Proximal
Tubule (HPPT) cells to show genome-wide gene expression patterns after cytokine stimulation,
with emphasis on the ACE2/dACE2 locus. Putative regulatory elements controlling dACE2
expression were identified using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. qRT-PCR differentiating between ACE2
and dACE2 revealed 300- and 600-fold upregulation of dACE2 by IFNα and IFNβ, respectively,
while full length ACE2 expression was almost unchanged. JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib ablated STAT1
and dACE2 expression after interferon treatment. Finally, with RNA-seq, we identified a set of
genes, largely immune-related, induced by cytokine treatment. These gene expression profiles
provide new insights into cytokine response of proximal tubule cells.

INTRODUCTION
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 infectivity depends on its receptor, the AngiotensinConverting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Physiologically, ACE2 serves as an element
of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system and Bradykinin system (Donoghue et al., 2000; Tipnis
et al., 2000). In SARS-CoV-2 infection, the viral spike protein binds ACE2 and facilitates viral entry
into cells. ACE2 expression has been detected in the kidney (Sungnak et al., 2020) and proximal
tubules via single cell transcriptome analysis (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020). However,
transcriptional regulation of ACE2 and its expression pattern in the kidney are poorly understood.
Human studies indicate, that changes in ACE2 expression are linked to type 2 diabetic
nephropathy (Mizuiri et al., 2008), IgA nephropathy (Mizuiri et al., 2011), hypertension (Koka et
al., 2008) and nephrosclerosis (Wang et al., 2010). Usually, decrease in ACE2 is associated with
disease, which may dysregulate ACE/ACE2 ratio, though both ACE and ACE2 may be regulated by
independent pathways (Mizuiri and Ohashi, 2015).
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a known complication of COVID-19 and it has been proposed
that decline in renal function in hospitalized patients is caused by the virus itself (Lynch and Tang,
2020). Even before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, AKI was a significant medical and socioeconomic
burden, with estimated one in three critically ill hospitalized patients suffering from decline in
kidney function (Hoste et al., 2018). If SARS-CoV-2 can indeed directly enter tubular epithelium
and contribute to the injury, understanding regulation of its renal receptors, as well as associated
immune response, is of utmost importance (Su et al., 2020).
Recently, a new isoform of ACE2, dACE2 was identified in several cell types (Blume et al.,
2020; Fignani et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2020; Onabajo et al., 2020). Contrary to

earlier reports (Ziegler et al., 2020), where ACE2 was suggested to be an interferon stimulated
gene (ISG), expression of dACE2 was much more significantly regulated by cytokine or viral
stimulation. In fact, in come cells, like pancreatic β-cells, dACE2 may be the prevalent isoform
even at the baseline (Fignani et al., 2020). Usually, decrease in ACE2 expression is linked with
disease progression, however, it is unknown whether dACE2 has an impact on these readouts, as
methods used to this date assessed ACE2 without discerning between isoforms. Additionally,
increased ACE2 levels were found in several animal models of kidney disease, and contribution
of dACE2 to these changes remains to be assessed (Moon et al., 2008).
Here, for the first time, we investigated presence and regulation of dACE2 in human
primary proximal tubule cells. We show that dACE2, but not full-length ACE2 (flACE2) is
abundantly expressed after interferon treatment, is transcribed from an intronic promoter and
contains one additional protein-coding exon. We also confirm, that similarly to lung epithelium,
dACE2 is regulated by the JAK/STAT pathway. Finally, we present a global analysis of ISGs present
in renal epithelium.
These findings provide new understanding of interferon-mediated immune response in
the kidney, especially in context of ACE2 activation observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection and may
serve as a basis for better understanding of the commonalities between various kidney diseases.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Recent research (Blume et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2020; Onabajo et al., 2020) revealed the
presence of an alternative promoter within intron 9 of the ACE2 gene, driving expression of a
short isoform of ACE2 (dACE2). Based on lung epithelium cell data, it was proposed that its
extracellular enzymatic and viral spike protein-binding domains are truncated, resulting in at
least partial loss of its carboxypeptidase function. While some experiments suggested the
presence of dACE2 RNA in healthy kidney tissue and tumors (Ng et al., 2020; Onabajo et al., 2020),
its structure, function and presence of regulatory elements, as well as interferon-inducibility in
the kidney have not been investigated in detail.
To understand the regulation of the ACE2 locus, including dACE2, and to identify putative
genetic control elements in human primary proximal tubules, we conducted ChIP-seq and RNAseq experiments (Figure 1A-F) before and after IFNβ stimulation. The presence of H3K27ac (active
chromatin), H3K4me1 (enhancers), H3K4me3 (promoter marks), RNA polymerase II loading (Pol
II) and DNase hypersensitive sites (DHS) were used to locate putative regulatory regions.
Several such elements were identified in the ACE2 locus (Figure 1A-C). Sequences at the
recently identified promoter in intron 9 and the alternative exon 1c, the first coding exon of
dACE2, were enriched for H3K27ac and H3K4me1 marks supporting the combined presence of
promoter and enhancer elements. Interferon  (IFN) exposure resulted in increased H3K27ac
coverage and Pol II loading, as well as increased RNA-seq read mapping demonstrating the
activation of the intronic promoter (Figure 1C, F, Supplementary Figure 1). In contrast, full length
ACE2 promoter marks, which seem to be more pronounced in the kidney than in the lung(Lee et

al., 2020), were decreased after IFNβ stimulation. To confirm the presence of dACE2, we
amplified and sequenced the novel dACE2 transcript and confirmed that exon 1c is spliced to
exon 10 of ACE2 (Ng et al., 2020; Onabajo et al., 2020) (Supplementary Figure 1A). Two TATAbox like sequences were identified, suggesting the presence of more than one TSS associated
with the intronic promoter (Supplementary Figure 1B). Additionally, strong H3K27ac marks were
induced by IFN around exon 11 of ACE2. These marks are almost absent in lung cells as reported
by Lee et al. in lung epithelium (Lee et al., 2020). In turn, two putative enhancer elements
reported at the site corresponding to 3’ end of ACE2 gene in lung cells seem to be much weaker
in the kidney. RNA-seq analyses demonstrated 5-fold IFNβ-induced expression of exon 1c,
compared to exon 1a that harbors the first methionine of the full length ACE2 (Figure 1F,
Supplementary Figure 1C). Finally, in addition to the ACE2 and TMEM27 promoters, a candidate
enhancer element can be seen between the two genes, as indicated by a H3K4me1 mark.
Additionally, an analysis of the extended ACE2 locus revealed that ACE2 and TMEM27 are under
similar interferon regulation and are bordered by CTCF chromatin boundaries suggesting that
they are part of a regulatory unit (Supplementary Figure 2). The TMEM27 locus displayed
increased H3K27ac and H3K4me3 promoter marks indicating gene activation after IFNβ
treatment (Figure 1E). This finding may have additional significance for the kidney, as TMEM27
gene encodes collectrin, ACE2 homologue, primarily expressed in renal proximal tubule and
collecting duct(Mount, 2007). Collectrin, similarly to ACE2, regulates blood pressure(Chu and Le,
2014) and amino-acid transport (Malakauskas et al., 2007). Finally, the STAT1 locus after
interferon stimulation shows increased H3K4me3 promoter marks and Polymerase II binding,
also indicating gene activation (Figure 1D).

Next, we used qRT-PCR to assess quantitative differences between ACE2 and dACE2
upregulation after cytokine treatment. First, we analyzed the expression of total ACE2 (flACE2
and dACE2 combined), the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming and transcription
factor STAT1 for JAK/STAT pathway activation (Figure 2 A-C). Total ACE2 mRNA was upregulated
6- and 13-fold by IFNα and IFNβ, respectively, while TMPRSS2 was elevated after IL-1β treatment,
indicating its regulation by an independent pathway. Both IL-1β and TMPRSS2 were reported to
be downregulated in nasal basal epithelium after azithromycin treatment(Renteria et al., 2020),
suggesting a potential pathway shared with proximal tubules. Further, STAT1 expression was
strongly upregulated after interferon treatment. To differentiate between expression changes of
flACE2 and dACE2, we used isoform-specific qRT-PCR (Figure 2 D, E). While a 3-fold elevated
mRNA level was detected in qRT-PCR designed for exon 9 of ACE2 (flACE2), amplification of exon
1c yielded mean 300-, 590- and 27-times upregulation of dACE2 for IFNα, IFNβ and IFNγ
treatments, respectively.
To investigate whether upregulation of ACE2 or its isoform are regulated by the JAK/STAT
pathway, as suggested by upregulation of STAT1 after interferon treatment, we used a JAK1/2
inhibitor, ruxolitinib (Figure 2 F-H). Cells were incubated with 10 µM ruxolitinib or vehicle (DMSO)
with or without 10 ng/ml IFNβ. Upregulation of both dACE2 and STAT1 was ablated by ruxolitinib
treatment, while no significant changes to full length ACE2 expression were observed.
We also conducted unbiased RNA-seq analyses from cytokine (IFN, IFNβ, IFN and IL-1β)
treated cells to investigate genetic programs and ISGs in human primary proximal tubules. 735
genes were significantly induced by IFN, 1218 by IFNβ, 1106 by IFN and 2142 by IL-1β
(Supplementary Tables 1-4, respectively). Immune response genes were significantly enriched in

the gene set significantly upregulated by IFNβ (Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Figure 3).
Expression of key immune signature genes, including IFN-response genes, was significantly
induced, especially by interferon type I treatment (Figure 3 A-H). We identified interleukins (IL4l1,
IL15), toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR4), Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRF1, IRF7), Interferon
Induced Proteins (IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFI44) and chemoattractants (CXCL10, CXCL11) as
significantly upregulated by IFN and/or IFNβ. Some of the significantly upregulated genes are
known to be regulators of renal injury, but belong to divergent pathways, either driving
inflammation like IRF1 or TLR4 (Wang et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2007) or attenuating it like IL4 and
IL15 signaling (Eini et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2017). Recently, Ichimura et al. (Ichimura et al., 2020)
reported that KIM-1 (HAVCR1) might serve as an additional SARS-CoV-2 receptor. KIM-1 is usually
upregulated in kidney injury models, but interferon treatment alone did not yield increase in its
expression.
While it is certain that ACE2 is necessary for SARS-Cov-2 to enter cells, our study suggests
that reports of ACE2 expression changes in response to interferon treatment and viral infection
must be analyzed carefully and with dACE2 in mind. So far, very few studies reported on dACE2
after SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Its role remains unknown and its promoter was postulated to
be a remnant retroviral ISG (Ng et al., 2020). Blume et al.(Blume et al., 2020) report lack of
increase of ACE2 or dACE2 after SARS-CoV-2 stimulated BCi-NS1.1 lung cells. Onabajo et al.
(Onabajo et al., 2020) similarly show lack of their upregulation in lung Calu3 cell line, but colon
cancer Caco-2 and T84 lines exhibited slightly increased dACE2 expression after SARS-CoV-2
exposure. This may in part be due to tissue-specific regulation of ACE2 and dACE2. Standardized
and validated detection method of both ACE2 isoforms, as well as understanding of regulatory

elements present in ACE2 locus is necessary to forward this topic. This is especially true for
studies at the protein level, as detection methods such as Western blot are contradictory
between reports (Blume et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2020). In our attempts to investigate protein levels
of dACE2 using Western blot, we were able to observe a 50 kDa band, however its presence and
intensity was not consistent between various anti-ACE2 antibodies (data not shown). We
summarized current knowledge on factors causing dACE2 upregulation in Supplementary Table
5.
In our study, we identified several putative regulatory elements controlling ACE2, as well
as confirmed presence of dACE2 in renal epithelium. We describe reliance of dACE2 expression
on JAK/STAT pathway, which may be of clinical importance, as JAK inhibitors are currently used
to treat COVID-19(Cao et al., 2020). Finally, we present a dataset of cytokine-regulated genes in
human primary proximal tubules, establishing a reference point for further studies. In conclusion,
the data presented here are of relevance not only for COVID-19 pathophysiology research and
therapy development, but also for diseases where ACE2 expression is altered. Despite ACE2 being
a known entry gate for multiple viral strains, a clear picture of its regulation and presence in the
tissues is still missing. Revisiting old paradigms and using new techniques such as ChIP- and RNAseq may deliver novel results, as we still learn about transcriptional regulation of well-established
mechanisms.

METHODS

Cell culture and cytokine stimulation
Human Primary Proximal Tubule (HPPT) Cells (ATCC® PCS-400-010™) were cultured in low-serum
medium consisting of Renal Epithelial Cell Basal Medium (ATCC® PCS-400-030™) with Renal
Epithelial Cell Growth Kit (ATCC® PCS-400-040™), Penicillin-Streptomycin-Amphotericin B
Solution (ATCC® PCS-999-002™) and Phenol Red (ATCC® PCS-999-001™) added. Cells were
obtained at passage 2, cultured according to manufacturer’s instructions and used between
passages 4 and 6. In addition to characteristic cobblestone growth pattern when confluent, cells
were confirmed to express several proximal tubule markers including y-glutamyltransferase-1
and HAVCR1 (KIM1) as assessed with RNA-seq. Cells were stimulated with IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, TNFα,
IL-6 and IL-1β (all obtained from Peprotech) for 12 hours in concentration of 10 ng/ml. Cells were
treated with ruxolitinib (Peprotech) at 10 µM for 12 hours together with IFNβ. At least three
biological replicates were prepared for all experiments.

RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR
After cytokine stimulation, cells were washed twice with PBS before RNA isolation to remove
medium and debris. mRNA was isolated using PureLink™ RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen) and 500 ng
was transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Invitrogen).

additional basis for filtering artifacts. The visualization was done using dplyr (https://CRAN.Rproject.org/package=dplyr) and ggplot2 (Risso et al., 2014). Significantly differential expressed

genes with an adjusted p-value (pAdj, FDR) below 0.05 and a fold change > 2 for up-regulated

read numbers were calculated using Samtools (Li et al., 2009) software with sorted bam files.

ChIP-seq library preparation and data analysis
Cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 0.75% formaldehyde in DMEM for 10 minutes
in room temperature. Next, glycine was added to quench fixation in a final concentration of 125
mM and plates were incubated in room temperature for another 10 minutes. Cells were then
scraped and centrifuged at 4oC, 1 minute, 3000 rpm, then washed twice with cold PBS. Pellets
were re-suspended in 2 ml Farnham Lysis Buffer with protease inhibitors and incubated on ice
for 10 minutes. Then, the cells were pelleted again at 4oC, 5 minutes, 3500 rpm, and resuspended in TE buffer with protease inhibitors. Chromatin was sonicated for 3 minutes with a

A (Invitrogen) at 4oC overnight. The beads were then washed with RIPA, high-NaCl RIPA, LiCl
buffer and PBS. Next, DNA was eluted from the beads and reverse-crosslinked by incubating with
proteinase K at 65oC overnight. DNA was then purified with MinElute PCR Purification Kit
(Quiagen) and library preparation was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions for
NEBNext® Ultra™ II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (New England Biotechnology). Proper
library size distribution, with peak in 300-500bp range was confirmed using Bioanalyzer 2100
(Aligent), libraries pooled and sequenced with HiSeq 2000 (Illumina). Antibodies used: antiTrimethyl-Histone H3 (Lys4) (Millipore, CS200580), Anti-RNA polymerase II CTD repeat (Abcam,
ab5408), Anti-Histone H3K27ac (Active Motif, 39133), Anti-Histone H3K4me1 (Active Motif,
39297)
Quality filtering and alignment of the raw reads was done using Trimmomatic(Bolger et
al., 2014) (version 0.36) and Bowtie(Langmead et al., 2009) (version 1.1.2), with the parameter ‘m 1’ to keep only uniquely mapped reads, using the reference genome hg19. Picard tools (Broad
Institute. Picard, http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/. 2016) was used to remove duplicates
and subsequently, and Homer(Heinz et al., 2010) (version 4.8.2) software was applied to generate
bedGraph files. Integrative Genomics Viewer(Thorvaldsdottir et al., 2013) was used for
visualization.

Statistical analysis of data was performed with Prism 8. First, normal distribution of data was
assessed. Next, statistical significance was evaluated with 1-way or 2-way AVOVA followed by
Tukey’s multiple comparisons or a T-test depending on experimental setup. Values of: *p < 0.05,
**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001 were considered statistically significant.
