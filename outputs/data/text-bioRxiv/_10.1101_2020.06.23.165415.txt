Abstract

42

The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Therapeutic

43

neutralizing antibodies constitute a key short-to-medium term approach to tackle COVID-19.

44

However, traditional antibody production is hampered by long development times and costly

45

production. Here, we report the rapid isolation and characterization of nanobodies from a synthetic

46

library, known as sybodies (Sb), that target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-

47

2 spike protein. Several binders with low nanomolar affinities and efficient neutralization activity

48

were identified of which Sb23 displayed high affinity and neutralized pseudovirus with an IC50 of

49

0.6 µg/ml. A cryo-EM structure of the spike bound to Sb23 showed that Sb23 binds competitively

50

in the ACE2 binding site. Furthermore, the cryo-EM reconstruction revealed a novel conformation

51

of the spike where two RBDs are in the ‘up’ ACE2-binding conformation. The combined approach

52

represents an alternative, fast workflow to select binders with neutralizing activity against newly

53

emerging viruses.

Introduction

62

The emerging COVID-19 pandemic imposes a substantial social and economic burden worldwide.

63

The causative agent of COVID-19 that causes, among other symptoms, severe atypical pneumonia

64

in humans was quickly identified as a novel coronavirus and designated as SARS-CoV-2

65

Similar to its closest homolog SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 exploits the ACE2 (angiotensin

66

converting enzyme 2) receptor to enter host cells

67

spike protein that, upon binding to ACE2, mediates fusion of the viral membrane with the host

68

membrane. The ectodomain of the heavily glycosylated spike protein forms a trimer where each

69

protomer consists of a core S2 subunit and a distal S1 subunit. Each S1 subunit comprises a

70

receptor binding domain (RBD) that can switch between an exposed ‘up’ conformation and a

71

‘down’ conformation, where the latter is inaccessible for ACE2 binding

72

antibodies against various viral surface proteins are currently in clinical trials 11. Exposed on the

73

surface of SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein is the major antigenic determinant of the host immune

74

response and one of the main coronavirus drug targets

75

SARS-CoV-2 patients was suggested to improve the clinical outcome of patients with severe

76

COVID-19

77

neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and improved the clinical outcome of tested

78

animals in vivo 17–20. As an alternative to human antibodies, nanobodies (single-domain antibodies)

79

can also be used as therapeutics with the advantage of their small size, increased stability and

80

superior simplicity in production 21,22. Recently, several groups showed that nanobodies can inhibit

81

the binding of the spike protein to ACE2 and neutralize the virus 23–25. Nanobodies are traditionally

82

isolated from immunized camelids, however, the development of libraries of synthetic nanobodies

83

(sybodies) enables a faster and cheaper selection of binders against therapeutic targets 26.

84

Here, we report the selection of sybodies directed against the receptor-binding

85

domain of SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate that they can compete with ACE2 binding and neutralize

86

SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus. In particular, sybody 23 (Sb23) binds to recombinant RBD as

87

well as to the pre-fusion spike glycoprotein with high affinity and shows very potent neutralization

88

activity. A small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) model of a RBD-Sb23 complex indicated that

89

Sb23 binds in the vicinity of the ACE2 binding site on the RBD. Lastly, a cryo-EM structure of

90

Sb23 bound to the spike reveals that Sb23 binds in the ACE2 binding site on the RBD in both its

91

‘up’ and ‘down’ conformation and thereby effectively blocks ACE2 binding. Interestingly, the

92

cryo-EM reconstruction also reveals that the spike bound to Sb23 displays a previously unobserved

93

conformation where two RBDs are in the ‘up’ ACE2-binding conformation.

Results

96

Sybody selection, ELISA and sequencing

97

Sybody selections on biotinylated RBD were carried out with the three sybody libraries (concave,

98

loop and convex) following established procedures 26,27. The enrichment of binders against RBD

99

was closely followed by qPCR with enrichment factors of 100 - 9000 in the last selection round,

100

indicating strong specific enrichment (Fig. 1a). In general, sybodies that gave rise to a positive

101

ELISA signal for the RBD, did so also for the pre-fusion spike protein. ELISA signals for the spike

102

protein were on average higher compared to the RBD, which could be due to avidity effects caused

103

by the trimeric nature of the spike protein or an increased biotin density on the surface of the

104

protein. No binding to the negative control protein MBP was observed for any of the binders,

105

indicating RBD-specificity of the selected sybodies (Supplementary Fig. 1). Next, we sequenced

106

100 clones which were positive in ELISA against RBD and spike covering the three libraries

107

equally well. We obtained 85 unique sybody sequences (Supplementary Table 1). In total, 33

108

sybodies were derived from the concave, 32 from the loop and 20 from the convex library. Based

109

on sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis (Fig. 1b), it becomes clear that selected

110

binders cover a large sequence space.

111
112

Sybody purification and affinity analysis

113

62 unique sybodies were expressed in E. coli, purified via metal-affinity chromatography to high

114

purity and characterized by analytical gel filtration (Supplementary Fig. 2). We employed a

115

biolayer interferometry (BLI) assay to kinetically characterize the interaction of sybodies with

116

RBD and spike. Biotinylated RBD was immobilized on a streptavidin sensor and on- and off-rates

117

for all purified sybodies were determined at a single concentration (500 nM) yielding affinities

118

(KD) in a range of 5 nM -10 µM for the RBD (Supplementary Fig. 3). Most sybodies displayed

119

strong binding signals, but many of them exhibited fast off-rates, which is disadvantageous for

120

neutralization activity.

121

To obtain more accurate affinity data for RBD binding, we selected Sybodies 23, 42, 76

122

and 95 and determined their binding constants by analysing the on- and off-rates over a large range

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.23.165415; this version posted June 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

123

of sybody concentrations. Resulting affinities are listed in Fig. 2a-d. Tight binding of the selected

124

binders to RBD was further confirmed by thermal shift assays (Fig. 2e, f). In particular, the

125

interaction of Sb23 with RBD increases the melting temperature of RBD by almost ten degrees,

126

which is considerably more than for other binders.

127
128

Sybodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped viruses

129

To test whether the selected sybodies can neutralize SARS-CoV-2, we performed a neutralization

130

assay with lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

131

sybodies were screened for neutralization, identifying eleven capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-

132

2 at an IC50 <20 µg/ml, including six with an IC50 <5 µg/ml (Supplementary Fig. 4). No

133

neutralization of VSV-G pseudotyped viruses was evident for any sybody preparation, and a

134

control sybody targeting the human peptide transporter 2 (PepT2) did not show any neutralizing

135

activity. Sybody 23 (Sb23) represented the most potent sybody identified, with an IC50 of 0.6

136

µg/ml (Fig. 3a).

138

Sb23 competes with ACE2 for RBD binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

139

To obtain a deeper understanding of the neutralizing activity of the identified binders, we

140

performed BLI assays to monitor ACE2 binding to immobilized RBD in the presence or absence

141

of Sb23. ACE2 bound RBD with an affinity of 33.4 nM under the stated experimental conditions,

142

but no ACE2-RBD binding was detected in the presence of 150 nM Sb23 over the tested

143

concentration range (Fig. 3b). This could be attributed to either a direct competition for the receptor

144

binding motif, a steric hindrance or conformation induced changes upon Sb23 binding.

145

To confirm this observation in the context of the trimeric spike protein, we developed a

146

competition assay under equilibrium conditions to screen binding of Sb23 to the spike protein in

147

the presence or absence of ACE2 using microscale thermophoresis. This method is sensitive to

148

changes in size, charge state and hydration shell, and requires one binding partner to be

149

fluorescently labelled. We monitored binding of the fluorescently labelled Sb23 to the spike

150

protein in the presence of a constant concentration of ACE2. In case the sybody targets a different

151

epitope on the RBD of the spike protein than ACE2, the resulting affinity is expected to be

152

independent from the presence of ACE2. However, our data show that with increasing

153

concentrations of ACE2, the affinity of Sb23 to the spike protein drops 10-fold in the presence of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.23.165415; this version posted June 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

154

200 nM ACE2 (Fig. 3c). In conclusion, these data indicate that Sb23 and ACE2 compete for the

155

same or overlapping binding sites on SARS-CoV-2-RBD. At the same time the data also highlight

156

that Sb23 has a significantly higher affinity to the RBD than ACE2 since Sb23 can efficiently

157

replace ACE2 from a preformed complex.

158
159

Characterization of Sb23 and RBD interaction by SAXS

160

To shed light on the structural basis of the neutralization activity of Sb23 against SARS-CoV-2,

161

we collected SAXS on the RBD-Sb23 complex (Fig. 4a and b and Table 1). Complex formation

162

is confirmed as judged by the shift of the position of the maximum in p(r) and the increase of the

163

particle size Dmax upon Sb23 binding. The ab initio low resolution shape depicts the Sb23 and

164

RBD moieties in the complex (Fig. 4c) and indicates that Sb23 is bound at the extremity of the

165

RBD.

166

To obtain a more detailed understanding, we performed SAXS-based rigid body modelling

167

of the complex between Sb23 and RBD (Fig. 4d). The resulting hybrid rigid body model agrees

168

well with the ab initio shape of the complex (Fig. 4c) and, importantly, in all resulting models,

169

Sb23 is placed next to the ACE2 binding site and binds sidewise to the RBD as expected for a

170

binder from the concave designed library.

171
172

Cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 pre-fusion spike bound to Sb23

173

To understand how Sb23 neutralises SARS-CoV-2, we determined the cryo-EM structure of spike

174

bound to Sb23 (Figure 5a, b). In the pool of particles that enabled a high-resolution reconstruction,

175

approximately half of the particles had one RBD ‘up’ (1-up) and the other half a conformation

176

with two RBDs ‘up’ (2-up). To our knowledge, the latter conformation has not previously been

177

observed for the SARS-CoV-2 pre-fusion spike but has been observed for the MERS and SARS-

178

1 spikes

179

binds in the inner edge of the ACE2 interaction interface of the RBD thereby effectively hindering

180

ACE2 binding (Fig. 5c). Modelling the ACE2-spike interaction based on the ACE2-RBD crystal

181

structure (6LZG

182

hinders binding of ACE2 in both the ‘1-up’ and the ‘2-up’ conformation (Fig. 5d). Interestingly,

183

ACE2 binding to the ‘up’ protomer is hindered in the ‘1-up’ conformation also from Sb23 binding

184

the neighbouring ‘down’ protomer (Fig. 5a-c). This interprotomer-mediated blockage is true also

30,31

. In both main conformations and for both ‘up’ and ‘down’ spike protomers, Sb23

32

) of the soluble part of ACE2 bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD shows that Sb23

185

for the corresponding ‘up’ protomer in the ‘2-up’ conformation but not for the 2nd ‘up’ protomer

186

in this conformation. Hence, even if the blockage of ACE2 binding in the ‘1-up’ conformation

187

from two independent sites may contribute significantly to the efficacy in neutralization by Sb23,

188

the interprotomer-medicated blockage is reduced in the ‘2-up’ conformation.

189
190

Discussion

191

Currently there are no clinically validated vaccines or drugs against SARS-CoV-2 available.

192

Developing therapeutics is currently an ongoing world wide effort and the identification of

193

neutralizing antibodies constitutes a key approach to that. Here we demonstrate that it is possible

194

to select highly specific binders with neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 from a synthetic

195

nanobody library in a short period of time without the need of an immunization approach. None

196

of the unique sybodies identified in this work were identical among two independent selections

197

using the same libraries

198

potential for selecting several different high-affinity binders. It should be noted that different

199

constructs of RBD and selection approaches were used for the independent studies.

33,34

thus highlighting the high diversity of the three libraries and their

200

Four of our analysed sybodies (Sb23, Sb42, Sb76, Sb95) bound RBD with affinities of

201

10.6, 5.0, 58.1 and 43.9 nM, respectively. The neutralization activity of the sybodies was tested

202

using lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Sb23 was identified as

203

the most potent neutralizer with an IC50 of 0.6 µg/ml. Sb23 displays higher affinity for SARS-

204

CoV-2 RBD than the human receptor ACE2 and competitions assays suggest that Sb23 and ACE2

205

compete for the same or overlapping binding site. Based on initial models for the RBD-Sb23

206

complex derived from SAXS data it became clear that Sb23 binds next to the ACE2 binding site

207

causing a steric hindrance for ACE2 to bind.

208

A cryo-EM reconstruction of the spike revealed that Sb23 bound two conformations of the

209

spike, one ‘1-up’ and one novel ‘2-up’ conformation. The ‘2-up’ conformation of the spike

210

naturally confers extra avidity with its two binding sites for ACE2. We can at this stage only

211

speculate if the binding of Sb23 itself induces a conformational change that results in the ‘2-up’

212

conformation or if Sb23 promotes a conformational stabilization of the ‘2-up’ in the spike’s

213

dynamical landscape. Clearly, this novel conformation makes previously unexposed epitopes

214

accessible for the development of therapeutic binders in the central cavity of the spike, this includes

215

the lower portion of the RBD and possibly also the central helical region. Hence, the use of Sb23-

216

bound spike protein preparations may be an excellent avenue to develop novel binders in these

217

regions. Furthermore, the cryo-EM reconstruction of Sb23 bound spike will be crucial to develop

218

either multimeric preparations of Sb23 34,35 with even increased affinity and neutralisation ability

219

or structurally-based combination therapy using Sb23 in combination with other neutralising

220

binders of different origin.

221

The COVID-19 pandemic illustrates how previously unknown viral strains can emerge and

222

quickly spread across continents, causing hundreds of thousands of fatalities in a very short time

223

period. The rapid fabrication of treatments against new viral strains is a key component to prevent

224

such fatality rates in the future. Synthetic libraries are an alternative approach to rapid drug

225

development, quickly generating highly specific binders with neutralization potential.

Materials and Methods

229

Construct design, expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 proteins

230

The plasmid for the expression of the SARS-Cov2 prefusion-stabilized spike protein was obtained

231

by 10. In short, the gene encodes residues 1 − 1208 of 2019-nCoV S (GenBank: MN908947) with

232

proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987, a “GSAS” substitution at the furin cleavage site

233

(residues 682 − 685), a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif, a HRV3C protease cleavage

234

site, a Twin-Strep tag, an 8×Histidine tag and a secretion signal. The gene for RBD expression

235

comprises residues (319 − 566) of 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1 and was cloned into a pαH mammalian

236

expression vector containing a secretion signal, a C-terminal Sortase recognition motif and a non-

237

cleavable Histidine tag

238

secretion sequence (residues 1 − 17) were cloned in a pXLG vector with a C-terminal HRV3C

239

protease cleavage site and 2x FLAG Flag tag for purification.

25

. Residues 1 − 616 of human ACE2 including the native N-terminal

240

Suspension adapted HEK293-F cells were grown in 600-ml Bioreactors in 250 ml of serum

241

free FreeStyle medium in an incubator at 37°C with humidified atmosphere at 8% CO2 on an

242

orbital shaker platform rotating at 220 rpm. Cells were grown to a density of 0.4 - 3×106 cells/ml.

243

Cell counts and viabilities were determined by using standard Trypan blue exclusion methods in

244

cell counter (BioRad).

245

The spike and RBD constructs were transfected and expressed according to the following

246

protocol 36. One day before transfection, cells were seeded in culture medium at a density of 2×106

247

cells/ml. On the day of transfection, cells were centrifuged (5 min, RT, 100×g) and resuspended

248

in fresh FreeStyle medium to a final density of 20×106 cells/ml. DNA was added to a final

249

concentration of 1.5 mg/l, mixed and followed by addition of MAX PEI in 1:2 ratio (w/w).

250

Transfected cells were incubated at 37°C with agitation at 220 rpm in an 8% CO2 atmosphere for

251

45 min. After this incubation time, fresh FreeStyle medium was added to reach a final cell density

252

of 1×106 cells/ml. Media with secreted proteins were harvested 4 days post-transfection (10,000×g,

253

20 min, 4°C) and filtered (pore size of 0.22 µm) prior purification.

254

For the ACE2 transfection, DNA was added to a final concentration of 0.75 µg/10 6 cells,

255

mixed and followed by addition of Linear PEI 25K in a 1:2 ratio (w/w). The expression was

256

conducted in glass flasks with an initial cell concentration of 2×106 cells/ml in the presence of 2

257

mM sodium butyrate. Media containing the secreted ACE2 protein was harvested 2 days post-

258

transfection (1,000×g, 20 mins, 4°C).

259

SARS-CoV-2 pre-fusion spike for sybody selection, biophysical characterization and cryo-

260

EM was expressed and purified as previously described 25. For the purification of the RBD domain,

261

IMAC affinity chromatography was used 37. To 1 l of filtered medium imidazole was added to a

262

final concentration of 15 mM. Medium was loaded onto two 5 ml HisTrap™ High Performance

263

columns equilibrated with wash buffer (20 mM Na-P pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 15 mM imidazole),

264

connected in tandem to the ÄKTAPure chromatography system using a sample pump at a flow

265

rate of 2 ml/min. Columns were washed with wash buffer (20 mM Na-P pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl,

266

15 mM imidazole) until the absorbance reached a steady baseline. RBD was eluted in one-step

267

with elution buffer (20 mM Na-P pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole). Eluted protein was

268

concentrated by ultrafiltration using Corning® Spin-X® UF concentrators with a cut-off limit of

269

10 kDa prior gel filtration. The concentrated protein sample was loaded on a Superdex 200 Increase

270

10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with GF buffer (50 mM TRIS pH 7.4, 150 mM

271

NaCl) using an ÄKTAPure chromatography system. The elution profile was monitored at 280 nm

272

and collected fractions containing the target protein were concentrated to approximately 10 mg/ml,

273

flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until further use.

274

For the ACE2 purification, the cell culture medium was mixed with 10x washing buffer

275

(500 mM TRIS pH 8.0, 1.5 M NaCl) and loaded onto M2 FLAG beads. The beads were extensively

Chemical biotinylation

284

The RBD and spike proteins were chemically biotinylated using the EZ-Link NHS-PEG4-Biotin

285

kit (Sigma). For the RBD, the sample was first desalted using a PD-10 gravity flow column (GE

286

Healthcare) in 20 mM Na-P pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl. Subsequently, the sample was chemically

287

biotinylated for 2 hours on ice, using a 20-fold molar excess of biotin over the target protein. The

288

spike sample was chemically biotinylated in a similar manner, using a 10-fold molar excess of

289

biotin for 1 hour on ice. Both samples were further run on gel filtration, following the protocol

290

described above to remove non-reacted NHS-PEG4-Biotin. The fractions containing the target

291

protein were collected and concentrated to approximately 1 mg/ml. 5 % glycerol was added before

292

flash-freezing, and the samples were stored at −80 °C until further use.

293
294

Sybody selections, and ELISA

295

Sybody selections and ELISA were performed as described in detail

296

against biotinylated RBD were carried out using three synthetic libraries diverging in the length of

297

CDR3 loop, dubbed concave, loop and convex 26. One round of ribosome display followed by two

298

rounds of phage display were performed. All rounds were monitored using qPCR. To obtain

299

binders with increased affinities, one off-rate selection was performed during the second round of

300

phage display, using 5 µM of non-biotinylated RBD with a 5 min incubation time. Biotinylated

301

maltose-binding protein (MBP) was used as a negative control to determine the enrichment factor

302

for each phage display round. 94 individual colonies were randomly selected from each library

303

and cultured in TB medium for ELISA. The sybodies were expressed by inducing with 0.02 %

304

(w/v) L-Arabinose and the positive clones expressing RBD-specific sybodies were identified by

305

performing a periplasmic extraction and analysed against the two target proteins, biotinylated RBD

306

and biotinylated spike. The same procedure was performed for the MBP, used as background

307

control signal.

308

Periplasmic extracts were transferred to a microtiter plates, previously coated with Protein

309

A (Sigma), blocked in TBS-BSA buffer and subsequently incubated with anti-myc antibody

310

(Sigma). After capturing the individual sybodies, biotinylated target and control proteins were

311

added at 50 nM concentration. The last incubation step was performed by adding streptavidin-

312

HRP (Sigma). Between incubation steps, the plates were washed three times in TBS-BSA

313

containing 0.05 % Tween-20. ELISA signals were developed by adding TMB (Sigma) in 50 mM

314

Na2HPO4, 25 mM citric acid and 0.006% H2O2. ELISA signals were measured at an absorbance

315

of 650 nm.

316
317

Expression and purification of sybodies

318

The identified sybody genes of positive clones were chemically-transformed into Escherichia coli

319

MC1061 F- (Lucigen) cells. The cells were cultured in TB medium supplemented with

320

chloramphenicol (34 μg/mL) at 37°C shaking at 200 rpm. Once the optical density reached 0.4-

321

0.8 (at 600 nm), the cultures were induced with the addition of 0.02 % (w/v) L-Arabinose and

322

incubated at 22°C, 200 rpm overnight. The proteins in the periplasmic extract were released by

323

osmotic shock and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Ni-NTA

324

resin (Invitrogen) in TBS buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). The purified sybodies were

325

desalted in PBS (10 mM phosphate, 2.7 mM KCl and 137 M NaCl, pH 7.4) buffer, analyzed by

326

SDS-PAGE and gel filtration using a SRT SEC-100 (Sepax Technologies) column.

335

transfection, filtered through a 0.45 µm filter, and stored at -80°C until use. Pseudotyped viruses

336

sufficient to generate ~100,000 RLUs were incubated with serial dilutions of sybodies for 60 min

339

luminometer (Promega).

340
341

Biophysical methods

342

a) Thermal stability assays

343

The thermal stability of RBD, ACE2 and spike was monitored by nanoDSF (NanoTemper

344

Technologies) at a concentration of 0.25 mg/ml in PBS (10 mM phosphate, 2.7 mM KCl and 137

345

M NaCl, pH 7.4) buffer. To monitor binding-induced thermal shift changes of the RBD with

346

different sybodies, RBD at 0.25 mg/ml was incubated with 0.15 mg/ml of different sybodies (Sb23,

347

Sb76, Sb95, control Sb) and incubated for at least 10 min at RT prior analysis. Standard grade

348

nanoDSF capillaries (NanoTemper Technologies) were loaded into a Prometheus NT.48 device

349

(NanoTemper Technologies) controlled by PR. ThermControl (version 2.1.2). Excitation power

350

was adjusted to 30 % and samples were heated from 20 °C to 90 °C with a slope of 1 °C/min. All

351

samples were run in triplicates and error bars represent standard deviations. The stability of the

352

different sybodies was analysed in independent experiments and they all display transition

353

temperatures in the range of 70 – 95 °C.

354
355

b) Far-UV CD spectroscopy

356

RBD, spike protein and ACE2 were dialyzed or diluted by the buffer containing 10 mM Na-P (pH

357

7.5) and 20 mM NaCl to 0.11, 0.13 and 0.08 mg/ml, respectively. The CD spectrum was measured

358

on Chirascan CD spectrometer (Applied Photophysics) in a 0.1 mm cuvette between 195 and 260

359

nm with 1 nm steps ten times. The resulting spectra were averaged, buffer-subtracted and the

360

secondary structure was estimating by the K2D algorithm using Dichroweb40.

361
362
363

c) Biolayer interferometry (BLI)

364

The binding of selected sybodies to RBD or binding of RBD to ACE2 proteins was measured by

365

biolayer interferometry (BLI) using the Octet RED96 system (FortéBio).

366

For the RBD binding screening assay, biotinylated RBD was loaded on streptavidin

367

biosensors (FortéBio), pre-equilibrated in assay buffer (PBS-buffer supplemented with 0.5 % (w/v)

368

BSA and 0.05 % (v/v) Tween-20) for 20 min. Prior to association, a baseline step of 60 s was

369

performed. Subsequently, sensors were dipped in a well containing 500 nM target sybody

370

(association step) for 10 min followed by 15 min of dissociation time in the same buffer.

371

Concentration dependent kinetic assays were performed in a similar manner, by dipping

372

RBD-captured streptavidin biosensors in different concentrations of target protein (sybodies 23,

373

42, 76 and 95 or ACE2) ranging from 5-250 nM for 8 min followed by a 12 min dissociation step.

374

Competition assays of RBD-ACE2 with Sb23 were performed in an identical manner, containing

375

150 nM final concentration of Sb23 in all wells. All experiments were carried out at 22 ° C.

376

Data were reference-subtracted and aligned to each other in the Octet Data Analysis

377

software v10.0 (FortéBio), using a 1:1 binding model. All figures were prepared using Prism 8

378

(GraphPad).

379
380

d) Microscale Thermophoresis (MST)

381

The binding affinity of spike to Sb23 was measured by microscale thermophoresis using the MST

382

NT.115 device (NanoTemper Technologies). Sb23 was labelled via the His6-tag with RED-tris-

383

NTA dye (NanoTemper Technologies) in PBS-T (10 mM phosphate, 2.7 mM KCl and 137 M

384

NaCl, pH 7.4 supplemented with 0.05 % (v/v) Tween-20), following the manufacturer’s

385

instructions. A 2-fold dilution series of spike protein was prepared in PBS-T with the highest

386

concentration in the assay being 1250 nM. A 50 nM final concentration of labelled Sb23 was

387

mixed with the substrate dilution series and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before

388

loading the samples in standard capillaries. For the competition assay, the same procedure was

389

used but the spike dilution series were prepared in PBS-T buffer containing 800 nM of ACE2 (200

390

nM final concentration in the assay) and incubation of 10 min prior to mixing with labelled Sb23.

391

All measurements were performed in triplicate using 35 % LED and medium MST power. The

392

data were analysed using the MO. Affinity Analysis software (NanoTemper Technologies).

393

Figures were prepared using Prism 8 (GraphPad).

394
395

Small angle X-ray scattering measurements (SAXS)

396

The SAXS data were collected at the EMBL P12 beamline of the storage ring PETRA III (DESY,

397

Hamburg, Germany) using a robotic sample changer 41. The scattering from the protein solutions

398

and respective solvents was recorded on a Pilatus-6M pixel detector, radially averaged and

399

processed using standard procedures. For all constructs, a concentration series was measured in

400

the range of about 0.3 to 4 mg/ml and the data was extrapolated to infinite dilution as needed. The

401

radial average was performed and solvent scattering was subtracted using the SASFLOW pipeline

402

42

403

determined from the reduced data using relevant programs from the ATSAS suite 42. The ab initio

404

low resolution shapes were restored using the program MONSA

405

resolution models was computed by CRYSOL 44. Hybrid models of the sybodies and of the RBD

406

were constructed by CORAL

407

amending them by chains of dummy residues to represent the fragments not present in the crystal.

408

For RBD, three glycans were added to the most frequent relative abundance of glycan species, the

409

C-terminal portion was modelled as a coil, and the structure was refined using SREFLEX 46. The

410

model of Sb23-RBD complex was constructed using the rigid body modelling program SASREF

Cryo-EM sample preparation and Imaging

414

Spike trimer (0.7 mg/ml) and Sb23 (1.3 mg/ml) were mixed in a 1:3 molar ratio and incubated on

415

ice for 5 minutes. A 3-μl aliquot of the sample solution was applied to glow-discharged CryoMatrix

416

holey grids with amorphous alloy film (Zhenjiang Lehua Technology) in a Vitrobot Mk IV

417

(Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4°C and 100 % humidity (blot 10 s, blot force 3). Cryo-EM data

418

collection was performed with EPU 2.7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a Krios G3i transmission-

419

electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 kV in the Karolinska Institutet 3D-

420

EM facility. Images were acquired in nanoprobe EFTEM mode with a slit width of 10 eV using a

421

BioQuantum K3 (Ametek) during 1.5 seconds with a flux of of 8.7 e-/px/s resulting in a fluence

422

of 50 e-/Å2 equally fractionated into 60 frames. Motion correction, CTF-estimation, Fourier

423

binning (to 1.02 Å/px), particle picking and extraction were performed on the fly using Warp 48.

424

A total of 8,236 micrographs that fulfilled the required criteria (defocus less than 2 microns and

425

estimated resolution better than 4 Å) were selected and 387,116 particles were picked by Warp.

426

Extracted particles were imported into cryoSPARC v2.15.0 49 for 2D classification, heterogenous

427

refinement and non-uniform 3D refinement

428

throughout. After 2D classification (300 classes) 199,501 particles were retained and used to build

429

three ab-initio 3D reconstructions. These were further processed for heterogeneous refinement that

430

resulted in one reconstruction showing high-resolution structural features in the core of the spike.

50

. The particles were processed with C1 symmetry

431

After one round of homogenous refinement we performed 3D variability analysis using 3

432

orthogonal principle modes. In the ensuing analysis, we separated out 4 different clusters of which

433

two gave clusters that showed clearly contrasting reconstructions after separate homogenous

434

reconstructions (‘1-up’ and ‘2-up’). These two reconstructions were then used together with two

435

‘crap’ classes in high-resolution heterogeneous refinement of the original particle set selected from

436

2D classification. The current overall resolution of the ‘1-up’ and ‘2-up’ conformations using non-

437

uniform refinement

Two sybodies (76 and 88), expected to stem from the convex library, were found to belong to the

624

loop library, presumably due to a spill-over during the selection procedure.

(a) SARS-CoV-2 or VSV-G spike pseudotyped lentivirus was incubated with a dilution series of

679

Sb23 or a control sybody (specific for hPepT2). Neutralization by Sb23 was repeated at least in

680

duplicates and the error bars represent the standard deviation. (b) BLI sensorgrams of immobilized

681

SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2 in the presence (blue) or absence (black) of 150 nM Sb23. The

682

assay was performed in a concentration range of 200-12.5 nM ACE2 and fit of the data to a 1:1

683

binding model is shown in red. (c) Microscale thermophoresis (MST) binding data of spike with

684

fluorescently labelled Sb23, in the presence or absence of 200 nM ACE2. One representative

measurement is shown. Three independent measurements were performed and affinities of spike

686

to Sb23 in the absence of ACE2 ranged from 0.6 – 10 nM, while they were significantly lower in

687

the presence of ACE2 (KD= 58 – 200 nM).
