Abstract:
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), is a positive singlestranded RNA virus with a 30 kb genome that is responsible for the current pandemic. To date,
the genomes of global COVID-19 variants have been primarily characterized via short-read
sequencing methods. Here, we devised a long-read RNA (IsoSeq) sequencing approach to
characterize the COVID-19 transcript landscape and expression of its ~27 coding regions. Our
analysis identified novel COVID-19 transcripts including a) a short ~65-70 nt 5’-UTR fused to
various downstream ORFs encoding accessory proteins such as the envelope, ORF 8, and ORF 9
(nucleocapsid) proteins, that are relatively highly expressed, b) novel SNVs that are differentially
expressed, whereby a subset are suggestive of partial RNA editing events, and c) SNVs at
functional sites, whereby at least one is associated with a differentially expressed spike protein
isoform. These previously uncharacterized COVID-19 isoforms, expressed genes, and gene
variants were corroborated using ddPCR. Understanding this transcriptional complexity may help
provide insight into the biology and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to other
coronaviruses.

INTRODUCTION
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, is a highly infectious
betacoronavirus and the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) responsible for the
current 2020 global pandemic (as of December 2020; over 88 M cases worldwide based on
Worldometer.info). The disease predominantly affects the lungs and causes varying degrees of
severity and symptoms that range from asymptomatic to mild cases of fatigue, fever/chills,
cough, ache, and loss of smell, although up to 20% of cases will be severe with pneumonia,
dyspnea, and acute respiratory distress syndrome1,2. It has caused more infections to date than
other severe coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), combined3. The pathway of infection for both SARS-CoV-1 and 2 is via
a receptor binding domain (RBD) on the C-terminal of the spike protein S1 subunit protruding
from the viral capsid that binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), which is
present at high levels in pulmonary epithelia. Antibodies in convalescent patients are primarily
targeted to this RBD region and accordingly vaccine development has been focused on this
domain4. Notably, there are four distinct amino acid variants (G, V, E, G) present in the RBD
domain of SARS-CoV-2 that increase the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 binding to hACE2 relative to other
coronaviruses5,6. Developing a better understanding of the sequence variation and a
comprehensive transcript map of SARS-CoV-2 across global populations is important to better
understand viral biology, evolution, and the development of improved therapies against COVID19 infection.

In early January 2020, the first near complete SARS-CoV-2 genome was released to the GISAID
database and is widely used as the primary COVID-19 reference genome (NC_045512). As of
December 2020, over 47,600 SARS-CoV-2 sequences have now been recorded in the NCBI
database. SARS-CoV-2 is a large RNA virus with a ~29.8kb genome sharing up to 79% sequence
identity with SARS-CoV-1; other family members include HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63,
and HCoV-HKU1, which cause common colds3,7. SARS-CoV-2 contains 27 proteins generated by
14 open reading frames (ORFs) (Fig. 1a). The long ORF1a and ORF1b regions are translated as one
large peptide and then post-translationally cleaved into 15 nonstructural proteins (nsp), including
nsp 1-10, 12a/b, 13-16, an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), helicase (H), exonuclease
(Ex) and endonuclease (En)8. The nsp proteins include two viral proteases, nsp 3 (papain-like
protease) and nsp 5 (3C-like protease), involved in the post-translational processing of ORF1a/b.
Further downstream are the structural proteins, including the two subunits of the spike surface
protein, S1 and S2, which contain the least-conserved regions among coronaviruses, as well as
the regions encoding the receptor binding motif (RBM) within the RBD and a polybasic cleavage
site between S1 and S29. Following the S2 region are seven accessory proteins interspersed
between the envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid
phosphoprotein (N) regions. The most common methods for the molecular detection of COVID19 involve extraction of nucleic acids from nasopharyngeal swabs, conversion of RNA to cDNA,
and amplification using qPCR probes designed to conserved sites within the SARS-CoV-2 genome,
including regions in the E-protein and RdRP genes.

The mechanism of gene expression in positive strand RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2 is complex
with three hypothesized mechanisms for the production of mature RNAs, subgenomic (SG) RNAs,
from a large negative strand (-ve) RNA template. These proposed mechanisms include using 1)
the -ve strand internal promoter for transcription initiation; 2) prematurely terminated -ve
strands acting as heterogeneous templates for production of each SG RNA species; or 3)
discontinuous RNA synthesis of the -ve strand template10. The vast majority of COVID-19
genomes and transcripts sequenced to date have used short-read methods which, although
powerful for rapid sequencing results and sequence comparison, nonetheless yield limited data
on the different SARS-CoV-2 transcripts. In particular, we do not know the catalog of the
transcripts produced by the virus and the levels of these transcripts, nor do we know which single
nucleotide variants are associated with the different isoforms and mechanisms by which the
variants might have formed. Such information will be valuable for understanding the basic
biology of this virus and its pathogenicity11, particularly in the context of emerging new strains,
such as the recently identified B7.1.1 variant that may have increased transmission
characteristics12,13.

To better understand the SARS-CoV-2 RNA landscape, we adapted a long-read PacBio sequencing
technology to characterize SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomes from multiple COVID-19 patients. We
developed an analysis pipeline to describe a suite of COVID-19 transcripts, several of which
appear to be full-length, and describe their levels, a subset validated by ddPCR. We discovered
novel 5‘- and 3’-end UTRs and unusual associated transcriptional rearrangements. These UTRs
often included novel repetitive sequences. We further associate a natural single nucleotide

variant (SNV) associated with specific spike protein isoforms with an expression decrease relative
to the “wildtype” nucleotide. Taken together, these data provide new insight into the overall
transcript-processing landscape of SARS-CoV-2, including partially RNA edited transcripts, and
provide an improved framework for understanding COVID-19 variants, gene isoforms, and their
expression mechanisms.

RESULTS:
Characterization and quality of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
We adapted a method for long read sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts using Pacific
Biosciences SMRT Sequencing technology (Fig. 1). Patients from the San Francisco Bay Area were
tested for COVID-19 using nasopharyngeal swabs and an FDA-Emergency Use Authorized realtime RT-PCR method, with Cycle threshold (Ct) values recorded as a proxy for abundance
(Supplementary Fig. 1). We independently confirmed the presence and level of SARS-CoV-2
sequences using ddPCR (Fig. 1c). This is using the parallel E-protein primer/probes of the GoldStandard SARS-CoV-2 qPCR detection method, but with the additional dual-channel fluorometric
capacity of the ddPCR platform (Materials and Methods). From a set of 24 COVID-19 positive
samples, six of high quality were selected for sequencing and analysis (Fig. 1b). Total RNA isolated
from these high-quality nasopharyngeal samples showed an average transcript size of 1500-3000
nt using the Bioanalyzer (Fig. 1d) as compared to other samples that have many lower sized RNAs,
suggestive of some degradation (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The nasopharyngeal RNAs of these six
samples primarily produced a single band peak at 2 kb ranging from ~1.5 to 4 kb while
unexpectedly rRNAs from the human host were not detected in the Bioanalyzer data. Two SARS-

CoV-2 RNA controls were also analyzed in parallel with the patient samples, 1) a Twist Bioscience
SARS-CoV-2 (MT199235 – USA/CA9/2020) synthetic control containing six non-overlapping 5 kb
fragments and 2) SARS-CoV-2 RNAs isolated from Vero E6 mammalian cells transfected with a 30
kb cloned isolate (MN985325.1 -2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020) supplied by ATCC (ATCC® VR1986D™). These controls also produced a single band using the bioanalyzer (Supplementary Fig.
2). Overall, we conclude that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs of 1.5 to 4 kb in size dominate the pool of
nasopharyngeal RNAs in infected patients.

Long Read sequencing of SARS-CoV-2
Because patient SARS-CoV-2 RNAs are low in abundance, to optimize concentrations and
potentially identify as many SARS-CoV-2 transcripts as possible, two sets of total RNA were
pooled from three different high-quality COVID-19+ samples: Pool A (Patients 25, 125, 290) and
Pool B (Patients 90, 260, 300). Universal Human Reference RNA (UHRR, Agilent) was included to
balance the RNA concentrations in the pools. cDNA was generated from total RNA using a 9:1
ratio of random primers:anchored oligo-dT primer and used to generate cDNA libraries ranging
from 1500-3000 bp. SARS-CoV-2 viral transcripts were captured using custom designed 120bp
IDT probes. Sequencing was done on a single SMRT Cell on the PacBio Sequel system. This
resulted in 59,674 circular consensus sequence (CCS) reads from Pool A and 42,629 from Pool B.
Since the UHRR was spiked into the sample to increase RNA concentrations, the majority of
sequenced reads matched the UHRR controls (and not human host sequence as observed by lack
of rRNA), corroborating the observation that prior to spike-in, most real-world sample reads are

viral (Table 1). The average length of the reads was ~1915 nt for Pool A and ~1871 nt and in Pool
B (Table 1), and range in size from 300 nt – 5 kb (Supplementary Fig. 2a-b).

Diversity in transcript isoforms: Known and novel transcripts
To capture the variety of SARS-CoV-2 RNA transcripts and their expression levels from the longreads, we used a combination of StringTie v2.1.3 as well as our own custom pipeline to assemble
reads into transcript classes (LORE pipeline, Supplementary Fig. 3). The two pooled sets of data
from the six COVID-19 positive samples revealed at least fifteen distinct isoforms of SARS-CoV-2
transcripts based on the presence of presumed fusion events and that many of these contained
polyA tails (although this does not include the variable 5’ ends, which are heterogeneous).
Interestingly, only two of these isoforms were shared among the pooled sets, Ai2/Bi2 and Ai7/Bi3
(Fig. 2). In addition, three sets of sequences detected, Ai7, Bi1 and Bi3 at relatively low
abundance, lacked spliced regions or polyA tails and may thus represent either subgenomic
fragments or parts of transcripts. Finally, several fusion transcripts were found in very low
abundance <5 and are described further below. In aggregate, the transcripts fully covered the
reference genome isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (MT008022, NC_045512.2).

The majority of transcripts identified ranged in size from 300 nt to ~5kb and their relative
abundance based on read frequency (which may be biased) is shown in Fig. 2. We believe that
many of these are full length transcripts as they contain 5’ genomic regions as well as poly A tails.
Indeed, on average, 13.5% and 6.0% of transcripts in Pools A and Pool B, respectively, contained
poly A tails ranging from 15-40 A’s in length, which were found at the end of the majority of

identified isoforms. The majority of polyA transcripts were found on the transcript of the
accessory proteins isoforms, particularly the penultimate nucleocapsid (N) ORF (Fig. 2 green). The
high prevalence of this polyA transcript may be a result of 3’ bias of the RT-PCR method used to
generate the sequencing libraries.
Expression Levels of SARS-CoV2 ORFs and transcripts
All 27 ORFs were expressed, albeit at varying levels, in the nasopharyngeal samples (Fig. 2). The
majority of nsp (blue, Fig. 2) were found to be expressed on the same transcript, although at low
expression levels relative to the accessory proteins (in Pool A), whereas the spike protein had
expression levels below the limit of detection via StringTie in Pool A. However, the spike protein
was detectable as part of a long isoform also containing nsp and partial accessory protein (green,
Fig. 2) in Pool B. Each SARS-CoV-2 gene was also observed for the ATCC controls, albeit at more
homogenous expression levels, as expected for cloned products.

The two SARS-CoV-2 RNA controls (Twist and ATCC controls) were also sequenced in parallel with
patient samples. As expected, when mapped to genomic regions, the reads from the synthetic
interspaced 5 kb fragments of the Twist control produce five clusters of reads whereas the ATCC
control, generated in vitro, has a more distributed expression pattern similar to the COVID-19
patient samples (Fig. 3).

In the real-world patient samples, up to fourteen distinct isoforms were identified in the
population of RNAs, with the most abundant expression (highest FPKM) including four variations
of genes at the 3’ end ORFs (Fig. 2, left). These ORFs include part of the envelope protein (E), the

membrane glycoprotein (M), ORFs 6-8, ORF 9/nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) and ORF 10.
Corroborating the fusion hypothesis in coronavirus transcription, a shorter 1-65 nt segment of 5’
UTR, also described by Kim et al., was found to be joined or ‘alternatively spliced’ to four varieties
of isoforms, including M, N, and ORFs 6-8 (downstream accessory proteins), instead of the
annotated full-length 1-260 nt 5’ UTR10,15 (Fig. 2- green section). The ATCC control (derived from
clones) also showed a variety of full-length isoforms, some altogether lacking the expected fulllength 5’ UTR. Segregated isoforms of 5’ and 3’ UTR transcripts were also identified in the
population, as a subset of fused isoforms of N protein to poly A, missing ORF 10 and 3’ UTR (NA1
and NB1). Although the RNAs were heated to denature RNA structures (Methods), both 5’ and 3’
UTRs of coronaviruses are known to have significant secondary hairpin structures16 and the
reverse-transcriptase methods used to generate the sequencing libraries may be unable to
capture the entire 5’ region.

Discovery of novel single nucleotide variants and their differential expression
Distinct from traditional long-sequencing pipelines17,18, the Long-Reads Analysis (LORE) was
developed to additionally identify strings of consecutive genes, non-consecutive regions, as well
as characterize the single nucleotide variants (SNVs) transcripts alongside their relative
expression levels. A number of expressed novel single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were also
discovered in the long read regions as shown in Fig. 3; some of these likely have functional
consequences. In order to identify SNVs of high confidence, variant correction based on
sequencing depth was applied to correct for platform errors, which include RT-PCR amplified misincorporated single nucleotides, as well as the relatively high error rate of indels in raw PacBio

long-sequence reads (data not shown). Similarly, the ATCC controls are from cultured Vero cells,
potentially introducing variant amplification errors distinct from the original strain. Nine and
seven high confidence SNVs were identified in samples from Pools A and B, respectively, with a
minimum coverage depth of 25 reads (located >10 nt from the read ends). These SNVs are shown
relative to the Twist and ATCC controls in Fig. 3a. Four SNVs overlapped between Pool A and the
ATCC control (reference is a Washington source patient). Over 80% of the novel SNVs are C-to-U
(9) or A-to-G (4), suggesting an RNA editing (deaminase-like) modification (Supplementary Table
2). Positions 17747, 17858 and 18060 show expression of their alternate variants at 3%, 2% and
4%, respectively, and suggest these are candidate transcripts for partial editing (Figure 4a, purple
triangles). Positions 17747 and 18060 alter the coding amino acid, P-to-L and Y-to-C, respectively.
Note that the three patient samples P25, P125 and P290 are represented at ratios greater than
20% in Pool A at 0.48, 0.32, and 0.21, respectively (Materials and Methods), and partially edited
nucleotides could be representing a temporal event in any (or all) of the patients.

Other observations include the identification of SNV-type isoforms (Fig. 2, asterisks), as Ai2 and
Bi2 which are similar in shortened 5’UTR fusion with accessory ORFs but differ in a single SNV at
position 28144; and have >5-fold difference in expression levels. Among Pool A transcripts, NA5
isoform of nsp 14-16 (Ex, En, Me) fused to poly A, contain the wildtype “U” at position 26360,
while a subset of tiled reads (concatenated SNVs found in nsp 12b, 13-15), categorized here as
subgenomic (Fig. 2; SG-Pool A asterisks), contain the “C” SNV at the respective position.
Interestingly, two SNVs were found near (1-2 nt) protease cleavage site junctions that may have
important functional consequences. A C-to-U change was found 1 nt from the nsp2/3 cleavage

10

site at position 2721, and a G-to-U change was identified 1 nt from the spike subunit 1 and
subunit 2 cleavage site at position 23403 (Fig. 3a and 4a, green arrows). Interestingly, this latter
site is associated with a significant decrease in downstream expression levels (green downward
triangles, Fig. 3b) in Pool B compared to Pool A (wildtype). The spike protein isoforms from Pool
B showed lowered expression by at least five-fold and were associated with consecutive longsequenced reads that contained a series of SNVs including at the position 23403 SNV, two A-toG variants at position 21562 (1 nt before the AUG start site of S1 subunit) and position 22460
within the S1 subunit, as well as a G-to-U variant at position 25563 downstream of the S2 subunit
in ORF 3 (Fig. 2, SG-Pool B asterisks, Fig. 3b, green triangles, and Fig. 4a, blue asterisks).

Corroboration of sequence single nucleotide variant using ddPCR
In total, sixteen high quality SNVs were identified--in seven cases more than one SNV was found
to be expressed at a particular site, suggesting that these may be more polymorphic regions (Fig.
4) and represent different the patients from each Pool. We validated the presence of three SNVs
and their expression levels using ddPCR in comparison to the ATCC and Twist synthetic RNA
controls and the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan reference (MT008022) genome (Fig. 3-4a asterisks). Position
8782 (C>U) was confirmed as a wildtype “C” in Pool B and as expected, found to be the variant
“U” in the ATCC control (Fig. 4b); resulting in a synonymous mutation. In Pool A, position 23403
(A>G) was confirmed in the spike S1 subunit of the ATCC control and matched the reference
genome “A” nucleotide (Fig. 4c) whereas in Pool B had the “G” variant (Fig. 4c, bottom panel).
The latter of these SNVs result in an amino acid change, D-to-G. ddPCR also revealed (and
corroborated) the absolute levels of these isoforms in the pools. At position 14407 (nsp 12b), the

“C” nucleotide was confirmed in the Twist RNA control, while in Patient 300 (part of Pool B), the
“U” variant is observed. This latter variant results in an amino acid change P-to-L.

DISCUSSION:
Long-read sequencing identified a diverse transcriptional landscape in COVID-19 patients
compared to what has been described previously. A wide range of transcripts, and isoform
expression, was uncovered ranging 300-5000 nt in length, including detection of novel transcript
isoforms and differentially expressed isoforms related to newly identified SNVs. The recombined
architecture of SARS-CoV-2 was previously described by Kim et al., 2020 in Vero-infected cells
using Nanopore and Nanoball sequencing, which allowed for the identification of discontinuous
transcription events8. Similar to our observations of the ‘splicing’ of a shorter 65-70 nt 5’ UTR
(instead of full-length 265 nt annotated region) with various downstream ORFs, advancing a
‘fusion hypothesis’, Kim et al., suggest that viral transcription in COVID-19 includes a negativestranded intermediate form that facilitates fusion via the pausing and switching of RdRP
machinery at the ~10 nt transcription regulator sequence (TRS) body to TRS leader sites located
at ORF junctions9. There are over 400 TRS described among different types of viruses,
approximately four in coronaviruses19, where they can regulate viral transcript production20. In
parallel, Solinska et al. (2011) noted that positive strand RNA viruses, including coronaviruses,
use subgenomic RNAs as mRNAs, as observed in these long-sequence read data, whose
additional properties could affect replication, transcription, gene rearrangements, and
acquisition of non-self sequences21.

Many single nucleotide variants were identified through long reads, from which three were
corroborated using ddPCR. Position 23403, GAU to GGU, results in an amino acid change aspartic
acid (D) to glycine (G) in the spike protein (S:D614G). Interestingly, this glycine amino acid change
is associated with increased infectivity, improving spike protein density, and facilitating entry into
host ACE2 cells more effectively22. This variant was also described by Nextstrain analysis23
suggesting that patients in Pool B can be traced to an earlier occurrence (January 2020) than was
first reported in the Washington State strain source. Interestingly, nine non-synonymous
mutations in the spike protein have been of particular interest, having been characterized during
the first spread of COVID-19 in Europe (Nextstrain). Our analysis, identified additional new spike
variants in Pool B, including an A-to-G amino acid modifying at position 22460 (S:K300E), and one
found in the spike S1 5’UTR, 1 nt upstream of spike start codon at position 21562 suggesting a
possible regulatory role. Similarly, a structural role could be linked to the identified variant at
position 241 in the 5’ UTR of Pool B, associated to a phylogenetic branch point by Nextstrain23.
Overall, there have been reports of SARS-CoV-2 mutations thought to drive pathogenicity, several
of which are found within the spike protein region with corresponding changes in the coding
amino acid22,24. It will be of interest to further investigate the 3D protein structure in context to
these amino acid changes.

Notably, the majority of SNVs were found to be A-to-G or C-to-U deaminase changes reminiscent
of RNA editing events A-to-I ADAR and C-to-U APOBEC machinery. This pattern was observed
when SARS-CoV-2 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid-based RNA sequence data was compared with
those of other coronaviruses including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-125. In their work, the authors

proposed several mechanisms for SNV changes, including one where RNA editing occurs in
coordination with negative strand transcription events25. Several variants we found showed
partially expressed RNA editing, and several were located close to viral transcript rearrangement
junctions associated to transcripts of variable gene expression. This points towards biological
pathways operating in parallel to post-transcriptional modification events and secondary/tertiary
RNA structures being critical for the recognition of specific consensus sites and possibly
regulating the mechanisms by which viral transcript rearrangements and differential
transcription events take place26,27. Distinct RNA structures and relatively high frequency of RNA
viral recombination events in the family of Coronaviruses suggest a mechanistic regulation of
viral genome organization rather than a selection of an evolutionary advantageous genotype28.
Notably, distinct secondary structures are observed in coronaviruses, particularly the 5’ and 3’
UTRs16,29 which could additionally be involved in reassembly or fusion-like events. Spike protein
variants are of particular interest, as they are distinct from other coronaviruses8 and vaccine and
drug development have been based on these regions30.

Overall, the topography of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome is quite variable whereby the long-read
method of sequencing and analysis give clearer perspectives on the distinct isoforms consisting
of novel gene arrangements and SNVs, with varied expression and complexity, within and among
the SARS-CoV-2 patient samples. These observations of diverse viral transcripts suggest that RNA
editing, and recombination are relatively common occurrences and are likely part of viral
biological mechanisms for transcript organization in patients positive for COVID-1928. Further
investigation will be necessary to identify whether the abundance and reassortment of this viral

transcription landscape varies and has patterns associated with severity and persistence of the
viral infection, such as the control of infection in asymptomatic patients versus uncontrolled
spread in patients with severe COVID-19-related pathology.

Materials and Methods:
RNA extraction from nasopharyngeal swabs and Quality Control (QC).
The nasopharyngeal RNA swabs (in viral transport media, NP-VTM) from San Francisco Bay Area
COVID-19 positive patient samples (diagnosed by Stanford Clinics) were stored in 1:4 Ratio of
DNA/RNA shield to NP-VTM (total volume = 400uL) at -80oC prior to nucleic acid extraction
representing one tenth of the volume of the original nasopharyngeal swab sample. The AllPrep
DNA/RNA/Protein Mini Kit (Qiagen 80004) was used to extract total RNA in DEPC-treated water.
The quality of the total RNA was tested using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (RNA 6000 Pico assay)
noting that detection size range is 25 nt to10 kb, and the detection sensitivity range is 25-500

ddPCR Method to Detect SARS-CoV-2.
The PCR primer pair and fluorescently labeled primer probes are listed in Supplementary Table
3. Thank-you to the Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility (PAN, Stanford School of Medicine) for probe
and oligo synthesis. Digital Droplet PCR (ddPCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 method was adapted from
previous work in the Snyder Lab31 and developed to parallel qPCR Molecular Methods (GoldStandard, used worldwide) with the additional advantage of multiple channel detection allowing
for invivo SNV validation and quantification.

First strand cDNA synthesis for ddPCR was performed on Pool A, Pool B, and SARS-CoV-2
synthesized controls ATCC and Twist RNA samples. Mix 50 ng (range 1 ng-5 ug) of total RNA from
each sample, 1 uL random hexamers (50uM, N8080127, Invitrogen), 1 uL of 10 uM dNTP mix and
RNase free water for final volume of 12 uL and denature at 65oC for 5 min followed by immediate
chill on ice. Briefly spin down and mix in 4uL 5X First-Strand Buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3; 375
mM KCl; 15 mM MgCl2), 0.1 M DTT, 2 uL 0.1M DTT, and 1uL RNaseOUT™ (40 units/μL, #10777019) and incubate at 25oC for 2 min. Add 1 ul of 200 U SuperScript™ II RT (#18064014, Invitrogen)
for a final volume of 20 uL, and incubate at 25°C for 50 min. Inactivate the reaction by heating
at 70°C for 15 min and chill on ice, with a final spin down to collect the cDNA sample. cDNA

prepared for long-read sequencing can also be used. The annealing temperature was adjusted
when gene specific reverse primers were used instead of random hexamers for this cDNA step.

For the digital droplet PCR step, prepare 20X PCR primer/probe stocks (for final concentration of
18 uM forward primer, 18 uM reverse primer, 5 uM FAM probe and 5 uM HEX or VIC probe.
Prepare the ddPCR reaction by adding the reagents together: 10uL 2X Digital Super Mix
containing polymerase enzyme, dNTPs and buffer (#110026868, BioRad), 1uL 20X PCR
primer/probe stock, 1 uL cDNA from previous step (Pool A, Pool B and ATCC and Twist controls),
and make to 20 uL with RNase-free water. The ddPCR droplets were prepared using the QX200
Droplet Maker Machine and Droplet Generation Oil (#10040718, BioRad). Thermal cycling
protocol: 95oC for 10 min; 94oC for 30 seconds and 60oC for 1 min x 40 cycles (set to 50% ramp
speed) and cooled prior to droplet measurement using the QuantaLife/BioRad QX200 Droplet
Reader (Poisson distribution).

Bioinformatic analysis and viewer.
IGV_2.8.0 Browser32 was used to view and analyze the long-read sequences. StringTie_v233 was
used to identify and quantify (FPKM) long-read gene rearrangements (Supplementary Table 4).
StringTie v2.1.4 usage included long reads processing (-L) which also enforces -s 1.5 -g 0
(default:false) and reference annotation (-G) used for guiding the assembly process (GTF/GFF3).

While StringTie and IGV analysis were efficiently identifying gene rearrangements in consecutive
order, a subset of reads also contained novel sequences and gene rearrangements. To further
characterize the transcriptome landscape of real-world COVID-19 positive samples, a custom
bioinformatic

pipeline

was

designed.

Parts

(Supplementary Fig. 3): Part A- Identification and read-depth of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts and types
of isoform rearrangement (including poly A), Part B- Identification and read-depth of novel reads
(and repeats), and Part C- Identification and quantification of isoforms with SNV at ORF junction
and associated expression of downstream isoforms.
LORE Part A (characterize unusual gene rearrangements and polyA tails): A1) Select Identifiers
from Reference genome (consecutive order based on reference genome). A2) Use Identifiers to
-probe the transcripts (*.bam/*.sam output file). A3) Locate and quantify the number of
transcripts that contain the sequence of identifiers
LORE Part B (Characterize novel reads and/or repeats): B1) Identify novel reads as subsequences
(not in SARS-CoV-2 reference genome). B2) Localization of subsequence within the long-read
sequence reads (beginning of read up 30%, end of read greater >70% for reads greater than 3000
nt). B3) Identify, locate and quantify if subsequences are repeated. B4) Verification against NCBI
database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). B5) Filter out non-viral related genes (see nRep
below). B6) Optional: secondary structure of RNA using RNAfold (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgibin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi).
LORE Part C (SNVs and isoform relationship). SNVs are identified using IGV_2.8.0 Browser32.

(samtools-1.9). SNVs with minimum depth coverage 25 and minimum unique read coverage of 3
were selected as high quality (as summarized in Supplementary Table 2). C1) Identify junction
sites from the reference genome and categorize SNV locations within 10 nt from the junction.
Discern novel-splice junctions34. C2) Calculate differential expression level downstream of
isoforms containing SNVs relative to wildtype. RPKM = (CDS read count * 109) / (CDS length *
total mapped read count). FPKM or Fragment read is used when data is paired then only one of
the mates is counted.

Additional sequences (nRep) that are associated with the long-read PacBio platform as adaptor
sequence were identified using LORE (Part B). These nReps were located upstream and
downstream of known genes in 25-28% of the samples including controls: namely nRep1 a ~66
nt sequence “GGCAAUGAAGUCGCAGGGUUGUACUCUGCGUUGAUACCACUGCUUCCCUGUGGU
UGUACGUCAAGG” comprised of 3 core elements (A-B-C) and the entire nRep1 segment is
repeated (at least in part) up to 12 consecutive times and was up to 300 nt in length; nRep2
consists of a 25nt middle subsection of nRep1, “GUACUCUGCGUUGAUACCACUGCUU” (middle
core element, B-B) repeated up to eight time; nRep3 is also a subsequence of nRep1
“GGCAAUGAAGUCGCAGGGUU” (first core element, A-A) repeated up to nine times and was
mostly found upstream of the 5’ UTRs; and nRep4 is a combination of the core elements 2 and 1
(B-A), “GUACUCUGCGUUGAUACCACUGCUUCGGCAAUGAAGUCGCAGGGUU”. Overall, different
mixtures of these cores are found upstream of the SARS-CoV-2 ORFs, in particular nsp 3.
Interestingly, in four cases nRep1 sequences were located in the middle of SARS-CoV-2 ORFs (out
of order) or with exogenous genes (mammalian RAB and SOD2) suggesting these exogenous

adaptor primers form concatemers and can fuse with both viral and non-viral genes. These may
also be artifacts of reverse transcriptase polymerase skipping to novel sequences, partly due to
the predicted secondary structure of the repeat regions observed. This was also observed in
other coronavirus examples, particularly with ORFs at the 5’ end of the genome, including a
mouse coronavirus model that manifests viral hepatitis15,35. Consequently, these nReps are
filtered from the raw data file in the pipeline.

Red asterisks denote the SNVs corroborated by digital droplet PCR (b-d). Purple triangles are
candidates for partial-editing (coverage >500 reads (min. 25 reads), with the wildtype nucleotide
expressed at 2-5%). The x-axis is the position and type of SNV, where grey dots denote shared
SNVs with ATCC synthetic RNA control. The red dots represent six lower quality SNV candidates,
found in A-rich or T-rich regions, including the last nucleotide before poly A tail (position 29871),
suggesting a sequencing mis-incorporation. The y-axis is the read coverage depth of the SNV
(minimum of 20 reads, non-unique with cut off 3 unique). (b) ddPCR method showed that Pool B
patient samples (top panel) contained “C” wildtype nucleotide at position 8782 (within the nsp 4
gene), while the ATCC SARS-CoV-2 control (and Pool A) contained the “U” variant (bottom panel);
(c) This is contrasted with ddPCR whereby the ATCC control contained the wildtype “A” variant
(top panel) while the Pool B patient samples contained the “G” variant at position 23403
(spike/surface glycoprotein gene). Additionally, a decrease in droplet counts also corroborated
the decrease in expression observed in Pool B relative to the ATCC SARS-CoV-2 RNA control profile
(Fig. 3). (d) ddPCR also corroborates the wildtype ”C” at position 14407 (RdRp) in the Twist RNA
synthetic control (top panel), while patient 300 (P300) showed the “U” variant. P300 was one of
the samples in Pool B. See Supplementary Table 1 for primer/probe detail. Reference RNA genome
GenBank: MT008022.1 (Wuhan) was used. ddPCR allows for dual-channel probes (FAM and HEX)
which were designed to specify each nucleotide (wildtype and variant, respectively). FAM (y-axis)
is represented by blue dots and HEX (x-axis) is represented by green dots (droplets) in panels b-d.
