Abstract

22

An effective response to the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by

23

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will involve a range of

24

complementary preventive modalities. The current studies were conducted to evaluate the in

25

vitro SARS-CoV-2 antiviral and virucidal activity of astodrimer sodium, a dendrimer with broad

26

spectrum antimicrobial activity, including against enveloped viruses in in vitro and in vivo

27

models, that is marketed for antiviral and antibacterial applications. We report that astodrimer

28

sodium inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells, with 50% effective

29

concentrations (EC50) for i) reducing virus-induced cytopathic effect of 0.002 to 0.012 mg/mL in

30

Vero E6 cells, and ii) infectious virus release by plaque assay of 0.019 to 0.031 mg/mL in Vero

31

E6 cells and 0.031 to 0.045 mg/mL in Calu-3 cells. The selectivity index (SI) in these assays was

32

as high as 2197. Astodrimer sodium was also virucidal, reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by

33

>99.9% (>3 log10) within 1 minute of exposure, and up to >99.999% (>5 log10) shown at

34

astodrimer sodium concentrations of 10 to 30 mg/mL in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cell lines.

35

Astodrimer sodium also inhibited infection in a primary human airway epithelial cell line. The

36

data were similar for all investigations and were consistent with the potent antiviral and virucidal

37

activity of astodrimer sodium being due to inhibition of virus-host cell interactions, as previously

38

demonstrated for other viruses. Further studies will confirm if astodrimer sodium binds to SARS-

39

CoV-2 spike protein and physically blocks initial attachment of the virus to the host cell. Given

40

the in vitro effectiveness and significantly high SI, astodrimer sodium warrants further

41

investigation for potential as a nasally administered or inhaled antiviral agent for SARS-CoV-2

42

prevention and treatment applications.

1. Introduction

46

The ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute

47

respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has resulted in unprecedented

48

efforts to rapidly develop strategies to contain infection rates for the protection of vulnerable

49

populations. An effective public health response to the current pandemic will involve currently

50

available vaccines being complemented by supplementary preventive modalities.

51

SARS-CoV-2 receptors and coreceptors have been shown to be highly expressed in nasal

52

epithelial cells (Sungnak et al., 2020). This finding is consistent with the virus infectivity or

53

replication pattern along the respiratory tract, which peaks proximally (nasal cavity) and is

54

relatively minimal in the distal alveolar regions (Hou et al., 2020). These findings suggest that

55

nasal carriage of the virus is a key feature of transmission, and that nasally administered

56

therapeutic modalities could be potentially effective in helping to prevent spread of infection.

57

Astodrimer sodium (SPL7013) is a generation-four lysine dendrimer with a polyanionic surface

58

charge (McCarthy et al., 2005) that is active against several enveloped and non-enveloped

59

viruses including human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (Lackman-Smith et al., 2008,

60

Tyssen et al., 2010), herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and -2 (Gong et al., 2005), H1N1 and H3N2

61

influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human papillomavirus (HPV),

62

adenovirus and Zika virus (unpublished data). Astodrimer sodium also has antibacterial

63

properties. Both size and surface charge contribute to the function of the compound (Tyssen et

64

al., 2010), and when administered topically, astodrimer sodium is not absorbed systemically

65

(Chen et al., 2009; O’Loughlin et al., 2010; McGowan et al., 2011).

Vaginally administered astodrimer sodium protected macaques from infection with chimeric

67

simian-HIV-1 (SHIV)89.6P (Jiang et al., 2005), and mice and guinea pigs from HSV-2 infection

68

(Bernstein et al., 2003) in vaginal infection challenge models. Astodrimer 1% Gel (10 mg/mL

69

astodrimer sodium) administered vaginally has been shown to be safe and effective in phase 2

70

and large phase 3 trials for treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis (BV) (Chavoustie et

71

al., 2020; Waldbaum et al., 2020; Schwebke et al., 2021) and is marketed in Europe, Australia,

72

New Zealand and several countries in Asia.

73

The current studies were conducted to assess the antiviral and virucidal activity of astodrimer

74

sodium against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, to determine its potential as a reformulated, nasally

75

administered or inhaled antiviral agent to help prevent spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

2. Materials and methods

77

2.1 Virus, cell culture, astodrimer sodium and controls

78

SARS-CoV-2 hCoV-19/Australia/VIC01/2020 was a gift from Melbourne’s Peter Doherty

79

Institute for Infection and Immunity (Melbourne, Australia). Virus stock was generated at

80

360Biolabs (Melbourne, Australia) by two passages in Vero cells in virus growth media, which

81

comprised Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) without L-glutamine supplemented with 1% (w/v)

82

L-glutamine, 1.0 µg/mL of L-(tosylamido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated

83

trypsin (Worthington Biochemical, NJ, USA), 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1%

84

insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS).

85

SARS-CoV-2 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 strain was isolated from an oropharyngeal swab

86

from a patient with a respiratory illness who developed clinical disease (COVID-19) in January

87

2020 in Washington, US, and sourced from BEI Resources (NR-52281). Virus was derived from

African green monkey kidney Vero E6 cells or lung homogenates from human angiotensin

89

converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice.

90

Vero E6 and human Calu-3 cell lines were cultured in MEM without L-glutamine supplemented

91

with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% (w/v) L-glutamine. Vero E6

92

and Calu-3 cells were passaged for a maximum of 10 passages for antiviral and virucidal studies.

93

Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) with 2% FBS was used for infection. The 2019-

94

nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 strain antiviral assays were performed with a multiplicity of infection

95

(MOI) of 0.1.

96

The virus inoculums for virucidal assays were 104, 105, and 106 pfu/mL. After defined incubation

97

periods, the solution was pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion (Beckman SW40 Ti rotor) and

98

resuspended in 1.5 mL MEM, which was then added to 2.5x104 cells/well.

99

Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC) (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) were grown and

100

maintained in HBEpC/HTEpC growth medium (Cell Applications, CA, USA). These primary

101

cells express the ACE2 receptor and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These cells were

102

used to determine the antiviral effect of astodrimer sodium against SARS-CoV-2 in a primary

103

human airway epithelial cell line. Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 2019-nCoV/USA-

104

WA1/2020 at 103 pfu/mL with 1 mL added to 2.5x104 cells/well. The positive control was

105

addition of 10 µg/mL of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody (pAb, T01KHuRb)

106

(ThermoFisher, MA, USA) at the time of infection.

107

Astodrimer sodium was prepared as 100 mg/mL in water and stored at 4°C. Astodrimer sodium

108

has a molecular weight of 16581.57 g/mol and the structure is described and illustrated in Tyssen

et al., 2010. The purity of the compound used in these studies was assessed by ultra-high-

110

performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) to be 98.79%.

111

Remdesivir (MedChemExpress, NJ, USA) was used as a positive control in the virus-induced

112

cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition and plaque assays.

113

Iota-carrageenan (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) was used in the primary epithelial cell

114

nucleocapsid and plaque assays to compare the antiviral activity of this substance with

115

astodrimer sodium. Concentrations used are those reported to show activity against SARS-CoV-

116

2 (Bansal et al., 2020).

117

2.2 Virus-induced cytopathic effect inhibition assay

118

Vero E6 (ATCC-CRL1586) cell stocks were generated in cell growth medium, which

119

comprised MEM without L-glutamine supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS and

120

1% (w/v) L-glutamine. Vero E6 cell monolayers were seeded in 96-well plates at

121

2x104 cells/well in 100 µL growth medium (MEM supplemented with 1% (w/v) L-glutamine,

122

2% FBS) and incubated overnight at 37°C in 5% CO2. SARS-CoV-2 infection was established

123

by using an MOI of 0.05 to infect cell monolayers.

124

Astodrimer sodium or remdesivir were serially diluted 1:3, 9 times and each compound

125

concentration was assessed for both antiviral efficacy and cytotoxicity in triplicate.

126

Astodrimer sodium was added to Vero E6 cells 1 hour prior to infection or 1 hour post-

127

infection with SARS-CoV-2. Cell cultures were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 4 days prior

128

to assessment of CPE. The virus growth media was MEM supplemented with 1% (w/v) L-

129

glutamine, 2% FBS, and 4 µg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin. On Day 4, viral-induced CPE and

130

cytotoxicity of the compound were determined by measuring the viable cells using the

131

methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (MP Biomedicals, NSW,

132

Australia). Absorbance was measured at 540-650 nm on a plate reader.

133

2.3 Antiviral plaque assay evaluation and nucleocapsid ELISA

134

For the antiviral evaluation, astodrimer sodium was added to cells 1 hour prior to, at the time of,

135

and 1 hour after exposing the cells to virus. For both the antiviral and virucidal assays, at 6 hours

136

after infection, cells were washed to remove astodrimer sodium and/or any virus remaining in the

137

supernatant, in such way that a

138

Following initial infection, cell cultures were incubated and supernatants recovered after 16

139

hours or 4 days. The amount of virus in the supernatants was determined by plaque assay (plaque

140

forming unit [pfu]) and by nucleocapsid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The

141

plaque assay used was as described in van den Worm et al., 2012, utilizing 2% sodium

142

carboxymethyl cellulose overlay, fixation of cells by 4% paraformaldehyde and staining with

143

0.1% crystal violet. The nucleocapsid ELISA assay was as described by Bioss Antibodies, USA

144

(BSKV0001).

145

The assessment of astodrimer sodium cytotoxicity occurred on Day 4 by measuring lactate

146

dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the cytoplasm using an LDH detection kit (Cayman Chemical),

147

with 0.5% saponin used as the positive cytotoxic control.

148

2.4 Virucidal assay

149

For the virucidal evaluation, concentrations of astodrimer sodium (0.0046 to 30 mg/mL) were

150

incubated with SARS-CoV-2 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 for times ranging from 5 seconds to

151

2 hours. To neutralize the effect of astodrimer sodium, unbound compound was separated from

152

the astodrimer:virus mixture by pelleting the preincubated mixture through a 20% sucrose

153

cushion (Beckman SW40 Ti rotor). The astodrimer sodium-containing supernatant was removed

154

(i.e., neutralising the effect of SPL7013) and then the pelleted virus was gently resuspended and

155

added to Vero E6 or Calu-3 cell cultures. Virus infection, cell culture and cytotoxicity

156

assessment was as described for the plaque assay described in Section 2.3.

157

All antiviral and virucidal assays were performed in triplicate, except where indicated in the

158

results.

159

2.5 Determination of 50% effective concentration (EC50) and cytotoxicity (CC50)

160

The concentration of compound that gives a 50% reduction in viral-induced CPE, infectious

161

virus (pfu/mL), or secreted viral nucleocapsid (EC50) was calculated using the formula of

162

Pauwels et al., 1998.

163

The concentration of compound that resulted in a 50% reduction in cell viability (CC50) after

164

4 days of culture was also calculated by the formula of Pauwels et al., 1998.

165

2.6 Primary Epithelial Cell Assay

166

Astodrimer sodium (0, 1.1, 3.3 and 10 mg/mL) or iota-carrageenan (0, 6, 60 and 600 µg/mL)

167

were added to HBEpC cells 1 hour prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Cells were cultured for

168

4 days post-infection and the cell supernatant was analysed for the amount of secreted SARS-

169

CoV-2 nucleocapsid by ELISA, and infectious virus was quantitated by plaque assay, as

170

described in Section 2.3.

171

3. Results

172

3.1 Virus-induced cytopathic effect inhibition

173

In two independent virus-induced CPE inhibition assays, astodrimer sodium inhibited SARS-

174

CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Australia/VIC01/2020) replication in Vero E6 cells in a dose dependent

175

manner (Table 1). Astodrimer sodium inhibited viral replication when added either 1 hour prior

176

to infection, or 1 hour post-infection with SARS-CoV-2.

177

Astodrimer sodium was initially tested in the range of 0.0013 to 8.63 mg/mL. In the repeat set of

178

assays, astodrimer sodium was tested in the range of 0.0001 to 0.86 mg/mL to help further

179

characterize the lower end of the dose response curve. The effective and cytotoxic concentrations,

180

and selectivity indices from the assays are shown individually and as means in Table 1 for CPE

181

determined readouts.

182

The selectivity index (SI) for astodrimer sodium against SARS-CoV-2 in the CPE studies ranged

183

from 793 to 2197 for the initial assays where compound was added 1 hour prior to infection and

184

1 hour after infection, respectively, and was >70 to >80 in the repeat assays, in which

185

cytotoxicity was not observed up to the highest concentration tested (0.86 mg/mL).

186

The positive control, remdesivir, was also active in the CPE inhibition assay, with a SI of >33.

187

3.2 Antiviral efficacy

188

To determine the ability of astodrimer sodium to inhibit globally diverse SARS-CoV-2 strains,

189

the compound was evaluated against the 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 virus in Vero E6 cells and

190

human Calu-3 cells. Antiviral readouts were based on virological endpoints of infectious virus or

191

viral nucleocapsid released into the supernatant post-infection. As shown in Table 2 and Figures

192

1 and 2, astodrimer inhibited the 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 strain with an EC50 0.019 to 0.031

193

mg/mL and 0.031 to 0.045 mg/mL for infectious virus release as determined by plaque assay in

194

Vero E6 cell for Calu-3 cells, respectively. These data are consistent with the inhibition by

195

astodrimer of the replication of the Australian SARS-CoV-2 isolate in vitro. The dose response

196

data for the nucleocapsid released into the supernatant by ELISA were similar to the infectious

11
197

virus release data in each cell line (data not shown). The positive control, remdesivir, was also

198

active in the plaque assay.

199

3.3 Virucidal efficacy

200

Virucidal assays investigated if astodrimer sodium could reduce viral infectivity by irreversibly

201

inactivating SARS-CoV-2 prior to infection of Vero E6 cells and human airway Calu-3 cells.

202

Following incubation of virus with astodrimer for up to 2 hours and neutralization of astodrimer,

203

the astodrimer-exposed virus was added to cell cultures. After either 16 hours or 96 hours (Day

204

4), the cell culture supernatant was collected for assessment of progeny viral infectivity as

205

determined by the amount of secreted infectious virus and nucleocapsid. The SARS-CoV-2

206

replication lifecycle is completed in approximately 8 hours (Ogando et al., 2020) and in these

207

studies, we sampled at 16 hours (2 lifecycles) or Day 4 (12 lifecycles) post-infection.

208

Enabling a possible 12 rounds of infection, the Day 4 (96 hour) sampling time point identified

209

that exposure of 106 pfu/mL SARS-CoV-2 to astodrimer sodium for 1 to 2 hours resulted in a

210

dose-dependent reduction in viral infectivity, with 10 to 30 mg/mL astodrimer sodium achieving

211

up to >99.999% (>5 log10) reduced infectivity in Vero E6 cells and >99.9% (>3 log10) reduced

212

infectivity in Calu-3 cells (data not shown) compared to untreated virus. SARS-CoV-2

213

infectivity was also reduced by up to >99.999% in Vero E6 cells when the incubation time of

214

astodrimer (10 to 30 mg/mL) with 106 pfu/mL virus was reduced to 15 to 30 minutes (data not

215

shown).

216

Incubation of astodrimer sodium with viral inoculums of 104, 105 and 106 pfu/mL for as little as

217

5 seconds resulted in evidence of reduced infectivity, with 10 to 15 minutes exposure being

218

sufficient to achieve >99.9% reduction in virus infectivity, and greater reduction achieved with

219

lower viral inoculum (>99.999%, 104 pfu/mL viral inoculum, 10 to 30 mg/mL astodrimer

220

sodium, and 10 to 15 min incubation time) (Table 3, Figure 3).

221

When assessed 16 hours post-infection of cells with astodrimer-exposed virus, it was found that

222

≥10 mg/mL astodrimer sodium inactivated >99.9% SARS-CoV-2 (104 pfu/mL) within as little as

223

1 minute of exposure (Table 4, Figure 4).

224

3.4 Antiviral Efficacy in Primary Human Airway Epithelial Cells

225

To determine the ability of astodrimer sodium to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary

226

human epithelial cells, the compound was evaluated against the 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020

227

strain in HBEpC cell culture. Astodrimer sodium was found to reduce infection of HBEpC

228

primary cells by SARS-CoV-2 by up to 98% vs virus control by nucleocapsid ELISA (Figure

229

5A), and by up to 95% in the plaque assay (data not shown). In contrast, treatment with iota-

230

carrageenan had minimal antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 in this cell line, with the highest

231

concentration tested reducing infection by just 17% by nucleocapsid ELISA (Figure 5B), and just

232

21% in the plaque assay (data not shown). The maximum level of inhibition with astodrimer

233

sodium was comparable to inhibition achieved with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody

234

(pAb, T01KHuRb) positive control (see Figure 5A and B).

235

4. Discussion

236

Astodrimer sodium demonstrated potent antiviral activity against globally diverse SARS-CoV-2

237

strains in vitro. Antiviral activity was demonstrated by reduction in CPE, release of infectious

238

virus and release of viral nucleocapsid protein. Antiviral activity was demonstrated when

239

240

added to cells already exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Irreversible virucidal activity was demonstrated

241

when astodrimer sodium was mixed with virus for as little as 1 minute.

242

Of note is a significantly high SI for astodrimer sodium in the antiviral assays relative to other

243

antiviral compounds under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 activity (Pizzorno et al., 2020).

244

Remdesivir was used as the antiviral positive control for the CPE inhibition and antiviral assays

245

and the experimental EC50 was consistent with published data generated with a different clinical

246

isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (Wang et al., 2020).

247

Astodrimer sodium inhibited infection of a human airway primary epithelial cell by SARS-CoV-

248

2, whereas iota-carrageenan, which is a polyanionic compound in marketed nasal spray

249

formulations, failed to provide significant inhibition at concentrations that have previously been

250

shown to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells (Bansal et al., 2020). The unique

251

structure of astodrimer sodium, a sulphonated, roughly spherical molecule with a core and

252

densely packed branches radiating out from the core, appears to provide potential benefits over

253

other polyanionic compounds such as iota-carrageenan and heparin, which are linear sulphated

254

molecules with a distribution of molecular weight. The authors are not aware of data showing

255

that iota-carrageenan is virucidal, while heparin has demonstrated a lack of irreversible, virucidal

256

interaction with HSV virion components (Ghosh et al., 2009).

257

The antiviral data are consistent with astodrimer sodium being a potent inhibitor of early events

258

in the virus lifecycle. The virucidal assay data suggest that astodrimer sodium antiviral activity

259

was consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of binding to virus, thereby irreversibly

260

inactivating virus and blocking infection.

14
261

The virucidal activity of astodrimer sodium demonstrated that it irreversibly inhibits the early

262

phase of virus infection and replication. These findings suggest potent inhibition of viral

263

attachment, fusion and entry of the virus, which prevents virus replication and release of

264

infectious virus progeny.

265

Astodrimer sodium has been previously found to be an effective antiviral that exerts its inhibition

266

in the early virus-host receptor recognition interactions (Tyssen et al., 2010; Telwatte et al.,

267

2011), and its potential mechanism of action against SARS-CoV-2 is likely similar to that

268

identified for other pathogens. Astodrimer sodium was found to bind to HIV-1 by strong

269

electrostatic forces to positively charged clusters of highly conserved amino acids on HIV-1

270

gp120 protein and/or positively charged amino acid regions located between the stems of V1/V2

271

and V3 loops, which are exposed by conformational changes to gp120 after viral binding to the

272

receptor/co-receptor complex (Tyssen et al., 2010; Connell and Lortat-Jacob, 2013).

273

Many viruses utilize negatively charged heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HS) on the cell plasma

274

membrane as an initial means to scan the surface of the cell, and to attach in order to chaperone

275

the virus onto the receptor complex prior to viral entry (Sarrazin et al., 2011; Connell and Lortat-

276

Jacob, 2013). The receptor interactions occur in a sequential manner with virus-HS interactions

277

preceding receptor/co-receptor binding, which combined leads to fusion of the viral envelope

278

and the cell membrane.

279

Data indicate that astodrimer sodium-gp120 interaction may physically block initial HIV-1

280

association with HS and thereby block the subsequent virus-receptor complex functions.

281

Virucidal studies of astodrimer sodium determined that it did not disrupt the HIV-1 particle or

282

cause the loss of gp120 spike protein from the viral surface (Telwatte et al., 2011).

15
283

A report by Liu et al., 2020, described that densely glycosylated trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)

284

protein subunit S1, which is important for receptor binding, binds to HS. To engage with the

285

ACE2 receptor, the S protein undergoes a hinge-like conformational change that transiently

286

hides or exposes the determinants of receptor binding (Wrapp et al., 2020). Recent studies have

287

identified the binding of heparin to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1 resulting in a

288

conformational change to the S protein (Mycroft-West et al., 2020a, b and c). Mutations in the S

289

protein that are distal from the RBD also impact on viral transmission (Walls et al., 2020; Korber

290

et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020). Non-RBD polybasic cleavage sites, including S1/S2 loop

291

(Hoffmann et al., 2020a), have been described on SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Qiao and Olvera de la

292

Cruz, 2020) and may also be a site of potential interaction with astodrimer sodium.

293

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the ACE2 receptor for viral infection of host cells (Hoffmann et al.,

294

2020b). Human CoV-NL63 also utilizes HS and ACE2 as its cellular receptor complex

295

(Milewska et al., 2014). The importance of HS for viral infectivity was also demonstrated for

296

close genetically related pseudo-typed SARS-CoV (Lang et al., 2011). The potential dependence

297

of SARS-CoV-2 on HS for attachment and entry combined with antiviral data from other viruses

298

suggest that negatively charged astodrimer sodium may have antiviral activity against SARS-

299

CoV-2 in vitro by blocking the early virus-receptor recognition events.

300

Astodrimer sodium is a polyanionic dendrimer reformulated for use as a topical, nasally

301

administered antiviral agent to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 before infection can occur. The potential

302

advantages of astodrimer sodium over other technologies include its lack of systemic absorption

303

following topical application (Chen et al., 2009; O’Loughlin et al., 2010; McGowan et al., 2011).

304

In addition, the SI of astodrimer sodium for SARS-CoV-2 is high and in a vaginal gel

305

formulation (10 mg/mL), the compound has been shown to be safe and effective in phase 2 and

large phase 3 trials for treatment and prevention of BV (Chavoustie et al., 2020; Waldbaum et al.,

307

2020; Schwebke et al., 2021) and is now marketed in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and

308

several countries in Asia. Astodrimer sodium is also the active antiviral substance in VivaGel®

309

condom products that have marketing authorization in Europe, Japan, Australia/New Zealand

310

and Canada. However, these current formulations are not appropriate for use to protect the

311

respiratory tract from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

312

5. Conclusions

313

Data from the current studies, taken together with studies of astodrimer sodium antiviral activity

314

against HIV-1, and HSV-1 and -2, indicate that the compound exerts its antiviral activity against

315

geographically diverse SARS-CoV-2 isolates by interfering with the early virus-cell recognition

316

events. Astodrimer sodium is a potent virucidal agent that reduces the infectivity of SARS-CoV-

317

2 by >99.9% after 1 minute of exposure to the virus. These studies support astodrimer sodium

318

being able to prevent early virus entry steps such as attachment, thereby reducing or preventing

319

viral infection or cell-cell spread.

320

An antiviral agent such as astodrimer sodium that blocks binding of the virus to target cells could

321

potentially be used as a preventive and/or a therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2. These

322

antiviral studies suggest that reformulation of astodrimer sodium for delivery to the respiratory

323

tract may be an effective preventive strategy to block SARS-CoV-2 transmission and augment

324

other protective and therapeutic strategies.

325

The potent antiviral and virucidal activity of astodrimer sodium against SARS-CoV-2 warrants

326

further investigation.
