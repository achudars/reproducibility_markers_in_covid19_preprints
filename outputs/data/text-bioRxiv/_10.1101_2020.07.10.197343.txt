Abstract
Several studies have analyzed antiviral immune pathways in severe COVID-19
patients. However, the initial steps of antiviral immunity are not known. Here, we
have studied the interaction of isolated primary SARS-CoV-2 viral strains with human
plasmacytoid pre-dendritic cells (pDC), a key player in antiviral immunity. We show
that pDC are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, they efficiently
diversified into activated P1-, P2-, and P3-pDC effector subsets in response to viral
stimulation. They expressed checkpoint molecules at levels similar to influenza virusinduced activation. They rapidly produced high levels of interferon-α, interferon-λ1,
IL-6, IP-10, and IL-8. Importantly, all major aspects of SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC
activation were inhibited by hydroxychloroquine, including P2- and P3-pDC
differentiation, the expression of maturation markers, and the production of
interferon-α and inflammatory cytokines. Our results indicate that pDC may represent
a major player in the first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and call for
caution in the use of hydroxychloroquine in the early treatment of the disease.

Introduction
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third
zoonotic coronavirus that emerged in the last two decades. SARS-CoV-2 is the
causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that appeared in late 2019
in Wuhan, Hubei province in China (Nandakumar, 2020; Sheahan and Frieman,
2020). SARS-CoV-2 became rapidly pandemic, and infection have now been
detected in 216 countries and territories, and is responsible for approximatively 10
million confirmed cases and 500,000 deaths as of 26 of June 2020 (WHO weekly
update).



SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to a diversity of clinical presentations, ranging from
asymptomatic or mild “flu-like” syndrome, to severe and life-threatening acute
respiratory failure. Disease aggravation usually occurs after 8 to 10 days following
initial symptoms (Tang et al., 2020). At this late stage, three main factors were shown
to contribute to the progression and severity of the infection (Tang et al., 2020): 1)
viral persistence was evidenced in the lung and systemic circulation, although it is not
constant (Tang et al., 2020), 2) an excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
such as IL-1b and IL-6 (Tay et al., 2020; Arnaldez et al., 2020), 3) a defect in type I
interferon (IFN) production, especially in critically ill patients (Tay et al., 2020;
Acharya et al., 2020). Although these abnormalities were confirmed in several
studies, their origin and underlying mechanisms remain mostly unknown. In
particular, it is not known whether an imbalance between inflammatory cytokines and
type I IFN occurs early in the disease, at the stage of the primary infection, and
whether the virus itself may be responsible. To fill this gap of knowledge, it becomes
essential to investigate the early innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Among
the immune cells that are involved in innate anti-viral immunity, plasmacytoid predendritic cells (pDC) play a particularly important role as the major source of type I
IFN in response to viral infection (Liu, 2005). PDC can sense a large array of viruses
including the coronaviruses murine hepatis virus (MHV) and the middle east
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) (Scheuplein et al., 2015; CervantesBarragan et al., 2007), and respond by producing innate cytokines, including all
forms of type I IFNs (α and β), type III IFN, and inflammatory cytokines, in particular
TNF-α and IL-6 (Liu, 2005; Yin et al., 2012; Gilliet et al., 2008). However, different
viruses may induce different cytokine patterns (Thomas et al., 2014), possibly
creating an imbalance between IFN versus inflammatory cytokine response.

Additionally, some viruses were shown to subvert pDC functions through different
mechanisms not necessarily related to productive infection. This is the case for HIV,
which may induce pDC apoptosis in vitro (Meyers et al., 2007) and pDC depletion in
vivo (Soumelis et al., 2001; Meera et al., 2010). Human hepatitis C virus can inhibit
IFN-α production by pDC through the glycoprotein E2 binding to BDCA-2 (Florentin et
al., 2012). Human papillomavirus induces very low IFN response in pDC (Bontkes et
al., 2005), which may be due to impaired TLR-7 and -9 signaling (Hirsch et al., 2010).
Whether SARS-CoV-2 induces efficient pDC activation, or may interfere with various
biological pathways in pDC is currently unknown.

In this study, we have systematically addressed the interactions between clinical
SARS-CoV-2 isolates and primary human pDC in order to reproduce the early stages
of the infection. We showed that pDC are resistant to productive infection with SARSCoV-2 strains but still mount substantial IFN responses upon viral challenge.
Interestingly, pDC responded to SARS-CoV-2 by a complete activation program,
including diversification into effector subsets, production of type I and type III IFN, as
well as inflammatory cytokines. We also showed that hydroxychloroquine, an
antimalarial drug proposed for treatment of COVID-19 patients (Das et al., 2020;
Mahévas et al., 2020), inhibits SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC activation and IFN
production in a dose-dependent manner. Our results establish pDC as a potential key

In order to efficiently recapitulate SARS-CoV-2-pDC interactions, we used two strains
of SARS-CoV-2 primary isolates. Their viral genome sequences were nearly identical
with 99,98% identity. Sequence comparison with reference strain Wuhan-Hu-1 (NCBI
accession number NC_045512.2) showed that both strains contain a subset of
mutations (C241T; C30307T; A23403G and G25563T), characteristic of the GH clade
based on GISAID nomenclature. Human primary pDC were purified from healthy
donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by cell sorting. First, we asked
whether SARS-CoV-2 was able to induce pDC activation, and diversification into IFNproducing and/or T cell stimulating effectors, as we previously described for influenza
virus A (Flu) (Alculumbre et al., 2018). After 24 hours of culture, SARS-CoV-2activated pDC efficiently diversified into P1 (PD-L1+CD80-), P2 (PD-L1+CD80+), and
P3 (PD-L1+CD80+) pDC subsets, similar to Flu stimulation (Fig 1A). P1-, P2-, and P3pDC were all significantly induced by SARS-CoV-2 and Flu, as compared to medium
control (Fig 1B). In parallel, we observed a sharp decrease in non-activated P0-pDC
(PD-L1-CD80-) (Fig 1A and B). SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC activation was
comparable with magnetically- versus FACS-sorted pDC (Fig S1A and S1B),
confirming that both methods are suitable for subsequent experiments. All main
findings were confirmed on at least three independent experiments using FACSsorted pDC, with a protocol that excluded AS-DC, a rare dendritic cell (DC) subset
that shares some markers and functional features with pDC (Villani et al., 2017),
based on CD2, CD5 and AXL expression (Fig S1A).
PDC activation and diversification was observed with two independent primary
SARS-CoV-2 strains (Fig 1C), which both induced similar proportions of P1-P3
subsets. PDC diversification was also observed by co-culturing of pDC with SARSCoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells with a similar efficiency than free SARS-CoV-2 (Fig

S1C). SARS-CoV-2 improved pDC viability as compared to medium condition (Fig
1D), which is compatible with subsequent effector functions.
Human pDC are not productively infected by SARS-CoV-2

Next, we asked whether SARS-CoV-2 -induced pDC activation was dependent on
productive infection. We first checked whether pDC express at their cell surface
ACE2, the major SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor (Hoffmann et al., 2020, 2). No
significant expression was detected using an anti-ACE2-specific antibody, as
compared to a low and high expression on Vero E6 and 293T-ACE2 cell lines,
respectively (Fig 1E). The ability of pDC to replicate SARS-CoV-2 was then
assessed. Human pDC were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 strain 220_95 at MOI of
2, and cultured for 2h, 24h or 48 h. Our results showed that pDC were refractory to
SARS-CoV-2 infection, as evaluated by quantifying 1) the intracellular production of
the nucleoprotein antigen (N) (Fig 1F), or the accumulation of viral RNA in SARSCoV-2-infected cells (Fig S1D), and 2) the release of infectious progeny virus in the
supernatants of infected cells using plaque assays (Fig 1G). As positive control, the
permissive Vero E6 cells produced high level of the N antigen, increased viral RNA
overtime (Fig S1D), and high viral titers following SARS-CoV-2 incubation (Fig 1G).
Similar results were obtained with pDC isolated from three independent donors (Fig
S1E). Overall, these results show that pDC are resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection,
and are efficiently activated by the virus independently of ACE2 expression. Their
viability was not affected by SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

Upregulation of major immune checkpoints on SARS-CoV-2-activated pDC
Activating immune checkpoints play a key role in T cell stimulation, and serve as
surrogate markers of DC differentiation (Guermonprez et al., 2002). We first

assessed the dose-dependent effect of SARS-CoV-2 on CD80 expression and
subset diversification. CD80 was induced in a dose-dependent manner by SARSCoV-2 at MOI 0.04 to 1 (Fig 2A). This was accompanied by an increase in P3-pDC
subset, and a slight decrease in P1-pDC (Fig 2B). A detailed phenotypic analysis was
subsequently performed on pDC after 24 and 48 hours of culture with SARS-CoV-2
(Fig 2C and Fig S2A). Diversification was observed at both time points, with a slight
increase in P3-pDC at 48 hours (Fig S2A). P2- and P3-pDC significantly upregulated
CD80, CD86, CCR7, and OX40L, as compared to non-activated P0-pDC, in both
SARS-CoV-2 and Flu conditions (Fig 2C). PD-L1, and CD62L, an integrin that
promotes lymph node homing, were both higher on P1- and P2-pDC (Fig 2C).
Expression of checkpoint molecules persisted at 48h, especially the higher CD80 and
CD86 expression on P3-pDC (Fig S2B).
Efficient production of type I and type III interferons by SARS-CoV-2-activated
pDC
A key and defining function of pDC is their ability to produce large amounts of type I
IFN (Gilliet et al., 2008). We measured the production of several cytokines at the
protein level after 24 hours of culture. Both SARS-CoV-2 and Flu induced high levels
of IFN-α2 and IFN-λ1, both being critical anti-viral effector cytokines (Fig 3A). IFN-α
levels following SARS-CoV-2 activation reached up to 80 ng/ml, indicating a very
efficient activation. The chemokine IP-10 was also significantly induced (Fig 3A),
possibly due to an autocrine IFN loop (Blackwell and Krieg, 2003). Inflammatory
cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 were comparably induced by SARS-CoV-2 and Flu (Fig 3A).
However, TNF-α levels were marginally induced by SARS-CoV-2 as compared to Flu
activation (Fig 3A). Cytokine production was maintained after 48 hours of viral
activation (Fig 3B). Secreted protein levels were similar to 24h levels for most

cytokines. Interestingly, IFN-α levels raised by 3-fold between 24h and 48h for one
donor (Fig 3A and B), indicating the possibility of increased production. Such strong
IFN producer suggests a potential virus controller.
Because the oropharyngeal mucosa is an entry site for SARS-CoV-2, we aimed at
validating our results using pDC purified from tonsils. SARS-CoV-2 induced a marked
diversification of tonsillar pDC into all three activated subsets (Fig S2C). Tonsillar
pDC efficiently produced IFN and inflammatory cytokines in response to SARS-CoV2 (Fig S2D). Overall, our results establish SARS-CoV-2 as a very efficient inducer of
type I and type III IFN responses. Inflammatory cytokines were induced at similar
level than Flu activation, without any significant imbalance that would be suggestive
of excessive inflammatory response.
SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC activation is inhibited by hydroxychloroquine
Given that SARS-CoV-2 did not infect pDC, and did not interfere with pDC activation,
we asked whether pharmacological agents could modulate pDC diversification and
cytokine production. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is known to inhibit endosomal
acidification which may diminish pDC activation (Kuznik et al., 2011, 9; Sacre et al.,
2012). Additionally, it is being tested in several clinical studies as a potential
treatment for COVID-19 (Das et al., 2020; Mahévas et al., 2020). Hence, we
addressed its role in SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC activation. Following 24 hours of
culture, we found that HCQ inhibited pDC diversification in response to SARS-CoV-2,
which is similar to the decrease observed with Flu, used as a positive control (Fig
4A). In particular, P2- and P3-pDC differentiation were almost completely inhibited
(Fig 4B). Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC diversification by HCQ was dosedependent (Fig S3A). The significant decrease in P3-pDC was paralleled by a
decrease in CD80, CD86, and CCR7 expression (Fig 4C and D). OX40-ligand

expression was not significantly affected by HCQ (Fig 4C and D). However, HCQ
inhibited the appearance of an OX40-ligandhigh pDC population (Fig S3B and S3C),
which may impact subsequent T cell activation. Last, we assessed the effect of HCQ
on innate pDC functions. We measured cytokine production after 24 hours of SARSCoV-2-induced pDC activation in the presence or absence of HCQ. We found that
IFN-α and λ levels were decreased by HCQ (Fig 4E). This was also the case for IL-6
and IL-8, with a much lesser impact on IP-10 (Fig 4E). Together, these results show
that HCQ inhibits SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC diversification and cytokine production.

Discussion
Type I IFNs are critical cytokines that control viral replication. Several chronic viral
infections were associated to poor type I IFN responses (Lee et al., 2013; Snell et al.,
2017; Marsili et al., 2012; Dolganiuc et al., 2006). In COVID-19 patients, decreased
serum levels of type I IFN were associated with severity in late stage infection, and
increased viral load (Tay et al., 2020; Acharya et al., 2020). This raised the question
as to whether SARS-CoV-2 was intrinsically capable of inducing a robust IFN
response, or on the contrary could interfere with IFN production and other antiviral
immune pathways. In this study, we have used primary SARS-CoV-2 isolates and
human primary pDC in order to increase the relevance to a naturally occurring
infection. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is a strong IFN inducer by
efficiently stimulating primary pDC. Viral sensing was independent of the expression
of the ACE2 entry receptor or the ability of the virus to replicate in pDC. However, the
precise molecular mechanisms involved remain to be investigated. Both type I and
type III IFNs were induced at high levels upon SARS-CoV-2 stimulation. This strongly

suggests that the defects observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients are acquired
during disease evolution through secondary events, not necessarily associated to
direct effect of the virus. Possible mechanisms could be related to inflammatory
cytokines, such as TNF, and endogenous glucocorticoid response, both being able to
promote

pDC apoptosis ((Abe and Thomson,

2006).

However,

additional

mechanisms may be involved and need to be explored in the context of severe
COVID-19.
An excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 β, IL-6 and TNF,
was associated to COVID-19 severity (Tay et al., 2020; Arnaldez et al., 2020; Vabret
et al., 2020). Their cellular source and the underlying mechanisms are currently
unknown. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC activation promotes a
balanced production of innate cytokines, including large amounts of type I and type III
INFs, without any significant excess in inflammatory cytokines. This suggests that
pDC activation may not be a causal factor of COVID-19 aggravation. In support to
that, recent studies indicated that endothelial cells may be a target of SARS-CoV-2
infection, and could be at the origin of the systemic and multi-organ production of
inflammatory cytokines (Pons et al., 2020). Bronchial epithelial cells could also be
involved in the production of high levels of IL-6, which were not detected in the serum
and in PBMC transcriptomic studies in severe COVID-19 (Wilk et al., 2020). This
supports the view of pDC as being protective through an early and efficient
production of antiviral cytokines, with later defects due to currently unknown
mechanisms, associated with late stage aggravation. On the contrary, nonprofessional innate immune cells such as endothelial cells and bronchial epithelial
cells may be involved in the secondary worsening of COVID-19 through the
excessive and uncontrolled production of inflammatory cytokines. Several therapeutic

approaches have been explored and are currently being tested in clinical trials on
COVID-19 patients (Vabret et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020). These include antiviral
agents (Yang et al., 2020), immune-modulatory molecules, such as glucocorticoids
(Fernández Cruz et al., 2020), and anti-inflammatory molecules, such as HCQ
(Touret and de Lamballerie, 2020; Lecuit, 2020). This latter drug was additionally
shown in in vitro studies to interfere with SARS-CoV-2 replication (Wang et al., 2020).
The difficulty in designing current and future COVID-19 treatment strategies lies in
part in the complexity of the host-virus interactions. Ideally, an efficient therapy
should control the excessive and potentially pathogenic inflammatory cytokine
response, while preserving antiviral effector pathways in order to efficiently control
viral replication. In our study, we have shown that SARS-CoV-2 effectively induced
type I IFN production by pDC during initial encounter with the virus. Given the
importance of IFN responses in the control of viral infections, pharmacological agents
that decrease IFN production should be avoided. Our results showing that HCQ could
inhibit all aspects of SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC activation call for a lot of caution in
the use of that drug in the context of COVID-19. A favorable cost-benefit ratio would
be expected only if a strong direct antiviral effect was demonstrated, associated with
an efficient ability to control the production of pathogenic inflammatory cytokines.
Else, interfering with pDC anti-viral response could contribute to a less efficient
control of SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent worsening of the disease.
Continued efforts in mapping and dissecting immune effector pathways to SARSCoV-2 will be of major importance in order to design efficient treatment strategies
adapted to each patient and stage of the infection.

PDC isolation and cell culture
Buffy coats from healthy human donors were obtained from Etablissement Français
du Sang, Paris, Saint-Antoine Crozatier blood bank. Peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) were isolated through Ficoll density gradient centrifugation (FicollPaque; GE Healthcare). PDC were isolated through a first step of pDC magnetic
sorting (Human Plasmacytoid DC Enrichment Kit; StemCell), and subsequent flow
cytometric sorting on the basis of live, lineage – (CD16, CD14, CD19, CD20, CD56
and CD3), CD11c– CD4+, and CD2– CD5– cells to a 98% purity. Due to some logistic
issues, alternatively frozen PBMCs from Etablissement Français du Sang, Paris,
Saint Louis blood bank, were thawed and placed at 37°C for 2h for cell recovery.
pDC were then magnetically sorted (Human Plasmacytoid DC Enrichment Kit;
StemCell). PDC enrichment was assessed based on the cytometric sorting panel,
and was ranged from 71 to 90%.
African green monkey kidney epithelial Vero E6 cells (ATCC, CRL-1586) were
cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific)
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% GlutaMAX and 25 mM
Hepes.

SARS-CoV-2 primary strain isolation and amplification
SARS-CoV-2 viruses were isolated from nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected
at Service de Virologie (Hospital Saint Louis, Paris). Samples were centrifugated at
4,000 x g for 10 min then filtered using a 0.45 μM filter, and diluted 1:1 with DMEM4% (DMEM supplemented with 4% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% GlutaMAX
and 25 mM Hepes). Vero E6 cells were seeded in 96-well cell culture plate (15,000
cells/well), and incubated at 37°C with 200μl of inoculum and observed daily for

cytopathogenic effects (CPE) by light microscopy. Substantial CPE were seen at 7296 hours post inoculation. Culture supernatants were then collected, clarified by
centrifugation, filtered using a 0.45 μM filter and kept at -80°C. We confirmed SARSCoV-2 replication by RT-qPCR and whole viral genome sequences were obtained by
next generation sequencing using Illumina MiSseq sequencers. Strains sequences
have been deposited in the Global Initiative of Sharing All Influenza Data (GISSAID)
database with accession ID EPI_ISL_469284 (220_95) and EPI_ISL_469283
(211_61). All viruses belong to the GH clade.
SARS-CoV-2 strains were further propagated on Vero E6 in DMEM-2% (DMEM
supplemented with 2% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% GlutaMAX and 25 mM
Hepes). Viruses were passaged three times before being used for experiments. For
the last passage, viruses were purified through a 20% sucrose cushion by
ultracentrifugation at 80,000 x g for 2 hours at 4°C. Pellets were resuspended in HNE
1X pH7.4 (Hepes 5 mM, NaCl 150 mM, EDTA 0.1 mM), aliquoted and stored at 80°C.
Viruses titer was ascertained by plaque assays in Vero E6 cells and expressed as
PFU per ml. Cells were incubated for 1 hour with 10-fold dilution of viral stocks. The
inoculum was then replaced with Avicel 2.4% mixed at equal volume with DMEM
supplemented with 4% FBS, 2% Glutamax, 50mM MgCl2, 0.225 % of NaHCO3, and
incubated 3 days at 37°C before plaque counting.

Infection assays
Vero cells were plated (50,000 cell per well) in p24-well plates 4 hours before being
incubated with SARS-CoV-2 diluted in DMEM-2%. Freshly purified pDC were seeded

in p96-well plates (50,000 cells per well) and incubated with SARS-CoV-2 diluted in
pDCs culture medium (RPMI 1640 Medium with GlutaMAX, 10% of FBS, 1% of MEM
NEAA, 1% of Sodium Pyruvate, and 1% of Penicillin/Streptomycin). At 2, 24 and 48
hour post-inoculation, Vero cells were trypsinized and transferred to p96-well plates.
Vero and pDC were washed with PBS and fixed with 2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde
(PFA) diluted in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated for 1 hour

Figure legends
Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 induces activation and diversification of primary human
pDC. Sorted blood pDC from healthy donors were cultured for 24h with either
Medium, SARS-CoV-2, or Influenza virus A (Flu). (A) Dotplot showing pDC activation
and diversification through the expression of PD-L1 and CD80 into P1-, P2-, and P3subpopulations. (B) Quantification of the three populations. Bars represent medians
of n=5 healthy donors. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; Mann Whitney test. (C) Dotplot showing
pDC activation from different strains of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from two patients. (D)
Percentage of live pDC after 24h of culture with either Medium, SARS-CoV-2, or
Influenza virus A (Flu). (E) Histogram of ACE2-expression on pDC, Vero E6 and
293T-ACE2 (black) compared to the isotype (light grey). (F) Intracellular production of
SARS-CoV-2 Ribonucleoprotein in Vero E6 and pDC at 2, 24 or 48h post infection
(hpi) with SARS-CoV-2. (G) Infectious viral titers in the supernatants of SARS-CoV-2infected Vero E6 and pDC at 2, 24, 48 or 72h post infection (hpi).

Figure 2. SARS-CoV-2 induces pDC activation in a dose dependent manner.
Sorted blood pDC from healthy donors were cultured for 24h with either Medium,
Influenza virus A (Flu), or SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 0.04, 0.2, or 1. (A) Dotplot
showing pDC activation through the expression of PD-L1 and CD80. (B)
Quantification of the three populations. Bars represent medians of n=3 healthy
donors. *P < 0.05; ns: not significant; Mann Whitney test. (C) PDC geometric mean
(MFI) of activation markers after 24h of culture with either Medium, Influenza virus A,
