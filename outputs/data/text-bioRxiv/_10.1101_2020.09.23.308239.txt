Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has challenged researchers at a global scale. The scientific
community’s massive response has resulted in a flood of experiments, analyses, hypotheses,
and publications, especially in the field drug repurposing. However, many of the proposed
therapeutic compounds obtained from SARS-CoV-2 specific assays are not in agreement and
thus demonstrate the need for a singular source of COVID-19 related information from which
a rational selection of drug repurposing candidates can be made. In this paper, we present the
COVID-19 PHARMACOME, a comprehensive drug-target-mechanism graph generated from a
compilation of several disease maps and experimental data focused on SARS-CoV-2 / COVID19 pathophysiology. By applying a systematic approach, we were able to predict the effect of
drug pairs on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Experimental validation of our results demonstrate that
our graph can be used to not only explore the involved mechanistic pathways, but also to
identify novel combinations of drug repurposing candidates.

Introduction and Motivation
COVID-19 is the term coined for the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Unprecedented in the
history of science, this pandemic has elicited a worldwide, collaborative response from the
scientific community. In addition to the strong focus on the epidemiology of the virus 1

2 3

,

experiments aimed at understanding mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of the virus
have led to new insights in a comparably short amount of time 4 5 6 7 .
In the field of computational biology, several initiatives have started generating disease
maps that represent the current knowledge pertaining to COVID-19 mechanisms8 9 10 11 . Such
disease maps have proven valuable before in diverse areas of research such as cancer 12,
neurodegenerative diseases13 14 and infectious diseases15.
When taken together with related work including cause-and-effect modeling8, entity
relationship graphs16, and pathways17; these disease maps represent a considerable amount
of highly curated “knowledge graphs” which focus primarily on COVID-19 biology. As of July
2020, a collection consisting of 10 models representing core knowledge about the
pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and its primary target, the lung epithelium, was shared with
the public.
With the rapidly increasing generation of data (e.g. transcriptome 18, interactome19, and
proteome20 data), we are now in the position to challenge and validate these COVID-19
pathophysiology knowledge graphs with experimental data. This is of particular interest as
validation of these knowledge graphs bears the potential to identify those disease
mechanisms highly relevant for targeting in drug repurposing approaches.

The concept of drug repurposing (the secondary use of already developed drugs for
therapeutic uses other than those they were designed for) is not new. The major advantage
of drug repurposing over conventional drug development is the massive decrease in time
required for development as important steps in the drug discovery workflow have already
been successfully passed for these compounds21 22.
Our group and many others have already begun performing assays to screen for
experimental compounds and approved drugs to serve as new therapeutics for COVID-19.
Dedicated drug repurposing collections, such as the Broad Institute library 23 , and the even
more comprehensive ReFRAME library24, were used to experimentally screen for either viral
proteins as targets for functional inhibition25, or for virally infected cells in phenotypic
assays26. In our own work, compounds were assessed for their inhibition of virus-induced
cytotoxicity using the human cell line Caco-2 and a SARS-CoV-2 isolate27. A total of 64
compounds with IC50 < 20 µM were identified, from which 90% have not yet been previously
reported as being active against SARS-CoV-2. Out of the active compounds, 37 are FDAapproved drugs, 19 are in phases 1-3 and 10 are preclinical candidate molecules. The
described mechanisms of action for the inhibitors included kinase signaling, PDE activity
modulation, and long chain acyl transferase inhibition (e.g. “azole class antifungals”).
The approach presented here integrates experimental and informatics workflows as well
as combining proprietary and public data to provide a comprehensive overview on the
therapeutic efficacy of candidate compounds, the mechanisms targeted by these candidate
compounds, and a rational approach to test the drug-mechanism associations for their
potential in combination therapy.

Methodology
Generation of the COVID-19 PHARMACOME
Disparate COVID-19 disease maps focus on different aspects of COVID-19 pathophysiology.
Based on comparisons of the COVID-19 knowledge graphs, we found that not a single disease
map covers all aspects relevant for the understanding of the virus, host interaction and the
resulting pathophysiology. Thus, we optimized the representation of essential COVID-19
pathophysiology mechanisms by integrating several public and proprietary COVID-19
knowledge graphs, disease maps, and experimental data (Supplementary Table 1) into one
unified knowledge graph, the COVID-19 Supergraph.
To this end, we converted all knowledge graphs and interactomes into OpenBEL 28, a
modeling language that is both ideally suited to capture and to represent “cause-and-effect”
relationships in biomedicine and is fully interoperable with major pathway databases 29 30. In
order to ensure that molecular interactions were correctly normalized, individual pipelines
were constructed for each model to convert the raw data to the OpenBEL format. For
example, the COVID-19 Disease Map contained 16 separate files, each of which represented
a specific biological focus of the virus. Each file was parsed individually and the entities and
relationships that did not adhere to the OpenBEL grammar were mapped accordingly. Whilst
most of the entities and relationships in the source disease maps could be readily translated
into OpenBEL, a small number of triples from different source disease maps required a more
in-depth transformation. When classic methods of naming objects in triples failed, the
recently generated COVID-19 ontology31 as well as other available standard ontologies and
vocabularies were used to normalize and reference these entities.

perpetuity. It is made available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

In addition to combining the listed models, we also performed a dedicated curation of
the COVID-19 supergraph in order to annotate the mechanisms pertaining to selected targets
and the biology around prioritized repurposing candidates. The resulting BEL graphs were
quality controlled and subsequently loaded into a dedicated graph database system
underlying the Biomedical Knowledge Miner (BiKMi), which allows for comparison and
extension of biomedical knowledge graphs (see http://bikmi.covid19-knowledgespace.de).
Once the models were converted to OpenBEL and imported into the database, the
resulting nodes from each model were compared (Figure 1). Even when separated by data
origin type, the COVID-19 knowledge graphs had very little overlap (3 shared nodes between
all manually curated models and no shared nodes between all models derived from
interaction databases), but by unifying the models, our COVID-19 supergraph improves the
coverage of essential virus- and host-physiology mechanisms substantially.

Figure 1: Venn diagrams comparing major constituent models in the COVID-19 supergraph. a) Manual node
comparison shows the overlap of entities in the models that are knowledge-based, manually curated
relationships that have been directly encoded in OpenBEL. b) Automated node comparison shows the overlap of
entities in models re-encoded into OpenBEL from other formats (e.g. SBML models).

Additionally, by enriching the COVID-19 supergraph with drug-target information linked
from highly curated drug-target databases (DrugBank, ChEMBL, PubChem), we created an
initial version of the COVID-19 PHARMACOME, a comprehensive drug-target-mechanism
graph representing COVID-19 pathophysiology mechanisms that includes both drug targets
and their ligands (Figure 2). Only drug-target relationships that have been experimentally
validated have been included. The entire COVID-19 supergraph was manually inspected and
re-curated. The COVID-19 PHARMACOME is openly accessible to the scientific community at
http://graphstore.scai.fraunhofer.de.

overall graph with 150662 nodes and 573929 relationships; b) represents the distribution of major classes of
entities (pathologies, molecular entities such as proteins, drugs) in the COVID-19 supergraph.

Systematic review and integration of information from phenotypic screening
At the time of the writing of this paper, six phenotypic cellular screening experiments have
been shared via archive servers and journal publications (Supplementary Table 2). Although
only a limited number of these manuscripts have been officially accepted and published, we
were able to extract their primary findings from the pre-publication archive servers. A
significant number of reports on drug repurposing screenings in the COVID-19 context
demonstrate how appealing the concept of drug repurposing is as a quick answer to the
challenge of a global pandemic. Drug repurposing screenings were all performed with
compounds for which a significant amount of information on safety in humans and primary
mechanism of action is available. We generated a list of “hits” from cellular screening
experiments while results derived from publications that reported on in-silico screening were
ignored. Therefore, we keep a strict focus on well-characterized, well-understood candidate
molecules in order to ensure that one of the pivotal advantages of this knowledge base is its
use for drug repurposing.
Subgraph annotation
The COVID-19 PHARMACOME contains several subgraphs, three of which correspond to major
views on the biology of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the clinical impact of COVID-19:
-

the viral life cycle subgraph focuses on the stages of viral infection, replication, and
spreading.

-

the host response subgraph represents essential mechanisms active in host cells
infected by the virus.

perpetuity. It is made available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

-

the clinical pathophysiology subgraph illustrates major pathophysiological processes
of clinical relevance.
These subgraphs were annotated by identifying nodes within the supergraph that

represent specific biological processes or pathologies associated with each subgraph category
and traversing out to their first-degree neighbors. For example, a biological process node
representing “viral translation” would be classified as a starting node for the viral life cycle
subgraph while a node defined as “defense response to virus" would be categorized as
belonging to the host response subgraph. Though the viral life cycle and host response
subgraphs contain a wide variety of node types, the pathophysiology subgraph is restricted to
pathology nodes associated with either the SARS-CoV-2 virus or the COVID-19 pathology.

Mapping of gene expression data onto the COVID-19 supergraph
Two single cell sequencing data sets representing infected and non-infected cells directly
derived from human samples32 and cultured human bronchial epithelial cells33 (HBECs) were
used to identify the areas of the COVID-19 supergraph responding at gene expression level to
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Details of the gene expression data processing and mapping are
available in the supplementary material (section gene expression data analysis).

Pathway enrichment
Associated pathways for subgraphs and significant targets were identified using the Enrichr 34
Python package. Briefly, gene symbol lists were assembled from their respective subgraph or
dataset and compared against multiple pathway gene set libraries including Reactome, KEGG,
and WikiPathways. To account for multiple comparisons, p-values were corrected using the

Benjamini-Hochberg 35 method and results with p-values < 0.01 were considered significantly
enriched.

Drug repurposing screening
We performed phenotypic assays to screen for repurposing drugs that inhibit the replication
and the cytopathic effects of virus infection. A derivative of the Broad repurposing library was
used to incubate Caco-2 cells before infecting them with an isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (FFM-1
isolate, see 36). Survival of cells was assessed using a cell viability assay and measured by highcontent imaging using the Operetta CLS platform (PerkinElmer). Details of the drug
repurposing screening are described in the supplemental material.

Drug combinations assessment with anti-cytopathic effect measured in Caco-2 cells
As described in Ellinger et al.,37 we challenged four combinations of five different compounds
with the SARS-CoV-2 virus in four 96-well plates containing two drugs each. Eight drug
concentrations were chosen ranging from 20 µM to 0.01 µM, diluted by a factor of 3 and
positioned orthogonally to each other in rows and columns. No pharmacological control was
used, only cells with and without exposure to SARS CoV-2 virus at 0.01 MOI.
In addition, recently published data from the work of Bobrowski et al.38, were mapped to
the COVID-19 supergraph and compared to the results of the combinatorial treatment
experiments performed here.

Results
Comparative analysis of the hits from different repurposing screenings
Data from six published drug repurposing screenings were downloaded, and extensive
mapping and curation was performed in order to harmonize chemical identifiers. The curated
list of drug repurposing “hits” together with an annotation of the assay conditions is available
under http://chembl.blogspot.com/2020/05/chembl27-sars-cov-2-release.html
Initially, we analyzed the overlap between compounds identified in the reported drug
repurposing screening experiments. Figure 3A shows no overlap between experiments, which
is not surprising, as we are comparing highly specific candidate drug experiments with
screenings based on large drug repositioning libraries. However, the overlap is still quite
marginal for those screenings where large compound collections (Broad library, ReFRAME
library) have been used.

Figure 3: Overlap of compound hits between different drug repurposing screening experiments. a) Direct
comparison of overlapping hits in drug repurposing screenings revealed no overlap between the experiments.
These experiments were performed using different cell types (Vero E6 cells and Caco2 cells). b) Protein target
space overlap between different COVID-19 drug repurposing screenings. Drug targets were identified by
confidence level >= 8 and single protein targets according to the ChEMBL database. Comparison of experiments
shows several common protein targets.

Mapping of repurposing hits to target proteins
In order to identify which proteins are targeted by the repurposing hits, and to investigate the
extent to which there are overlaps between repurposing experiments at the target/protein
level, we mapped all of the identified compounds from the drug repurposing experiments to
their respective targets. As most drugs bind to more than one target, we increase the
likelihood of overlaps between the drug repurposing experiments when we compare them at
the protein/target space. Indeed, Figure 3B shows an overlap of 112 targets between all the
drug repurposing experiments, thereby creating a list of potential proteins for therapeutic
intervention when the compound targets are considered rather than the compounds
themselves.

The COVID-19 PHARMACOME associates pathways derived from drug repurposing targets
with pathophysiology mechanisms
A non-redundant list of drug repurposing candidate molecules that display activity in
phenotypic (cellular) assays was generated and mapped to the COVID-19 PHARMACOME.
Figure 4 shows the distribution of repurposing drugs in the COVID-19 cause-and-effect graph,
the “responsive part” of the graph that is characterized by changes in gene expression
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the overlap between the two subgraphs. This
overlap analysis allows for the identification of repurposing drugs targeting mechanisms that
are modulated by viral infection.
A total number of 870 mechanisms were identified as being targeted by most of the drug
repurposing candidates. When compared to the annotated subgraphs in the COVID-19
PHARMACOME, 201 of the 227 determined associated pathways found for the viral life cycle

subgraph overlapped with those for the drug repurposing targets while the host response
subgraph shared 90 of its 105 pathways.

Mapping of drug repurposing signals to hypervariable regions of the COVID-19
PHARMACOME
One of the key questions arising from the network analysis is whether the repurposing drugs
target mechanisms that are specifically activated during viral infection. In order to establish
this link, we mapped differential gene expression analyses from two single-cell sequencing
studies to our COVID-19 supergraph (see section on “Differential Gene Expression” in
supplementary material). An overlay of differential gene expression data (adjusted p-value ≤
0.1 and abs(log fold-change) > 0.25) on the COVID-19 supergraph reveals a distinct pattern of
subgraphs characterized by the high responsiveness (expressed by variation of regulation of
gene expression) to the viral infection. Figure 4 shows the subgraph consisting of those triples
that are significantly regulated by virus infection, that are at the same time enriched for
repurposing drug targets and the intersection of both subgraphs.

Figure 4: Identification of suitable targets for combination therapy by comparing subgraphs within the COVID19 PHARMACOME. Overlay of the COVID-19 supergraph with gene expression data resulted in a subgraph
characterized by the entities (genes/proteins) that respond to viral infection (a). Mapping of the signals obtained
from drug repurposing screenings (IC50 < 10 µM) to the supergraph resulted in a subgraph enriched for drug
repurposing targets (b). The intersection between both subgraphs is highly enriched for drug repurposing targets
directly linked to the viral infection response (c).

Virus-response mechanisms are targets for repurposing drugs
In the next step, we analyzed which areas of the COVID-19 graph respond to SARS-CoV-2
infection (indicated by significant variance in gene expression) and are targets for repurposing
drugs. To this end, we mapped signals from the drug repurposing screenings to the subgraph
that showed responsiveness to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In Figure 4C, we demonstrate the
resulting subgraph that is characterized by the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2
infection and the presence of target proteins of compounds that have been identified in drug
repurposing screening experiments.

The COVID-19 PHARMACOME supports rational targeting strategies for COVID-19
combination therapy
In order to evaluate the potential of the COVID-19 PHARMACOME to guide rational
approaches towards combination therapy using repurposing drug candidates, we mapped
existing combinatorial therapy data to the COVID-19 PHARMACOME. Combinatorial
treatment data obtained from the paper published by Bobrowski et al.35 were mapped to the
COVID-19 supergraph. Analysis of the overlaps between the drug repurposing screening data
and the data from this combinatorial treatment publication showed that four of the ten
compounds in the synergistic treatment approach by Bobrowski et al. were represented in our
initial non-redundant set of candidate repurposing drugs. Figure 5 provides an overview on
the graph distance and the mechanistic embedding of the drug combinations used by
Bobrowski et al and in our own experiments.

experiments. The subgraph depicts the drug repurposing candidate molecules in relation to each other and their
targets. From this, distances between different drugs can be determined. Mechanistic embeddings and graph
distances are available in the supplementary material (Supplementary Table 3).

Based on the association between repurposing drug candidates and pathophysiology
mechanisms in the COVID-19 PHARMACOME, we hypothesized that the number of edges
between a pair of drug nodes may be linked to the effectiveness of the drug combination. In
order to evaluate whether the determined outcome of a combination of drugs correlated with
the distance between said drug nodes, we compared distances for combinations of drugs
within the supergraph for which their effect was known. On average, drug combinations that

were found to have a synergistic effect in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 had the shortest path
lengths (2.43) while antagonistic combinations were found to be farther apart (4.0).
Therefore, we decided to use the path lengths between pairs of drugs as a basis for choosing
new combinations of compounds to test. Ultimately, we selected five compounds: Remdesivir
(a virus replicase inhibitor), Nelfinavir (a virus protease inhibitor), Raloxifene (a selective
estrogen receptor modulator), Thioguanosine (a chemotherapy compound interfering with
cell growth), and Anisomycin (a pleiotropic compound with several pharmacological activities,
including inhibition of protein synthesis and nucleotide synthesis). These compounds were
used in four different combinations (Remdesivir/Thioguanosine, Remdesivir/Raloxifene,
Remdesivir/Anisomycin and Nelfinavir/Raloxifene) to test the potency of these drug pairings
in phenotypic, cellular assays. Figure 6 shows the results of these combinatorial treatments
on the virus-induced cytopathic effect in Caco-2 cells.

Figure 6: Dose-response curves (DRC) depicting viral inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by select drug combinations. a)
A threshold effect can be seen with the Remdesivir/Anisomycin combination when Anisomycin reaches 20 µM,
well beyond Anisomycin’s IC50 alone. Remdesivir activity does not appear to be affected by Anisomycin, while
Remdesivir seems to be equally affected (de-potentiated) by low to high concentrations of Raloxifene. b) Viral

inhibition for Remdesivir/Thioguanosine can be seen only at lower Thioguanosine concentrations, at higher
concentrations the clear curve shift of Remdesivir at lower concentration (effect beyond Loewe’s additivity
formula) could not be appreciated. c) Raloxifene had an antagonistic effect on Remdesivir’s viral replication
inhibition activity. d) A clear shift in Nelfinavir’s DRC can be observed when combined with Raloxifene, but also
suggests a threshold effect when Raloxifene concentrations are higher than 2.2 µM.

Our results indicate that compound combinations acting on different viral mechanisms, such
as Remdesivir and Thioguanosine (Figure 6b) or Nelfinavir and Raloxifene (Figure 6d), showed
synergy, while compounds acting on host mechanisms, for instance Anisomycin or Raloxifene,
when combined with Remdesivir (Figure 6a and Figure 6c, respectively), did not show neither
synergistic nor additive effects. Interestingly, the HIV-Protease inhibitor Nelfinavir, which
already appeared to be active against viral post-entry fusion steps of both SARS-CoV39 and
SARS-CoV-240, displayed synergistic effects when combined with high concentrations of
Raloxifene. Furthermore, from the combinations of drugs selected, the pair with the shortest
distance within the supergraph, Raloxifene and Nelfinavir (Supplementary Table 4), displayed
synergism. Our findings indicate that for some combinations of drugs, such as Remdesivir and
Anisomycin, there exists a threshold effect for which the presence of a second compound does
not continuously modulate the effect of the first.

Discussion
By combining a significant number of knowledge graphs which represent various aspects of
COVID-19 pathophysiology and drug-target information we were able to generate the COVID19 PHARMACOME, a unique resource that covers a wide spectrum of cause-and-effect
knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 and its interactions with the human host. Based on a systematic
review of the results derived from published drug repurposing screening experiments, as well
as our own drug repurposing screening results, we were able to identify mechanisms targeted
by a variety of compounds showing virus inhibition in phenotypic, cellular assays. With the
COVID-19 PHARMACOME, we are now able to link repurposing drugs, their targets and the
mechanisms modulated by said drugs within one computable model, thereby enabling us to
target - in a combinatorial treatment approach - different, independent mechanisms. By
challenging the COVID-19 PHARMACOME with gene expression data, we have identified
subgraphs that are responsive (at gene expression level) to virus infection. Network analysis
along with the overview on previous repurposing experiments provided us with the insights
needed to select the optimal repurposing drug candidates for combination therapy.
Experimental verification showed that this systematic approach is valid; we were able to
identify two drug-target-mechanism combinations that demonstrated synergistic action of
the repurposed drugs targeting different mechanisms in combinatorial treatments.
We are fully aware of the fact that the COVID-19 PHARMACOME combines experimental
results generated in different assay conditions. In the course of our work, we accumulated
evidence that assay responses recorded using Vero E6 cells in comparison to Caco-2 cells may
only partially overlap. Comparative analysis of the results of both assay systems to virus
infection by means of transcriptome-wide gene expression analysis is one of the experiments

we plan to perform next. However, for the identification of meaningful combinations of
repurposing drugs, the current model-driven information fusion approach was shown to work
well despite the putative differences between drug repurposing screening assays.
Given the urgent need for treatments that work in an acute infection situation, our
approach described here paves the way for systematic and rational approaches towards
combination therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We want to encourage all our colleagues to
make use of the COVID-19 PHARMACOME, improve it, and add useful information about
pharmacological findings (e.g. from candidate repurposing drug combination screenings). In
addition to vaccination and antibody therapy, (combination) treatment with small molecules
remains one of the key therapeutic options for combatting COVID-19. The COVID-19
PHARMACOME will therefore be continuously improved and expanded to serve integrative
approaches in anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery and development.
