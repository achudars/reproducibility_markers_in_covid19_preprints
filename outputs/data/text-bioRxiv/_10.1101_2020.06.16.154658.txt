Abstract—word count 48

12

Chickens, turkeys, ducks, quail and geese were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-

13

CoV. No disease was observed, no virus replication was detected, and antibodies were not

14

detected in serum. Neither virus replicated in embryonating chicken’s eggs. Poultry are unlikely

15

to serve a role in the maintenance of either virus.

Coronaviruses (CoV) of animals periodically transmit to humans (1) as recently occurred with

18

SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 was first recognized in December of 2019 with cases of atypical

19

pneumonia in hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China. The virus is a novel beta-coronavirus,

20

related to the now eradicated, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV from 2003 with

21

which it has 82% identity across the genome (2). SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible among

22

humans and particularly virulent for elderly individuals and those with certain underlying health

23

conditions. Multiple studies have examined the susceptibility of domestic animals to SARS-

24

CoV-2 to establish the risk of zoonotic transmission and two studies have shown chickens and

25

Pekin ducks were not susceptible to infection (3, 4).

26

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), another coronavirus of

27

high concern associated with zoonotic infection, was first detected in patients with severe acute

28

lower respiratory tract disease in Saudi Arabia in 2012. MERS-CoV causes lower respiratory

29

disease similar to the SARS-CoVs (5). Unlike SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV transmits poorly to

30

humans and does not exhibit sustained human-to-human transmission; however, it has a high

31

case fatality rate of around 30%. Although the MERS-CoV case count is low, human cases

32

continue to be reported, therefore there is a possibility for the virus to adapt to humans.

33

Based on sequence similarity, the closest relatives of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV are

34

believed to be bat beta-coronaviruses (6), but because of the amount of sequence difference

35

between human and bat isolates an intermediary host likely exists. For MERS-CoV, dromedary

36

camels appear to be the primary natural reservoir of infection to humans, but other domestic

37

animals seem to be susceptible to infection (7, 8). There is only a single study of MERS-CoV in

38

chickens that looked for antibodies, but all samples were negative (9).

39

Because poultry are so widespread and have close and extended contact with humans,

40

and other mammals in many production systems, including live animal markets, susceptibility

41

were conducted with SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV in five common poultry species.

42

Additionally, embryonating chicken eggs (ECE) have been utilized for the isolation and as a

43

laboratory host system, including use in vaccine production, for diverse avian and mammalian

44

viruses. Therefore, ECE were tested for their ability to support the replication of both viruses.

45

Five poultry species were examined: chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), turkeys

46

(Meleagris gallopavo), Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhinchos domesticus), Japanese quail (Coturnix

47

japonica) and White Chinese geese (Anser cygnoides). All procedures involving animals were

48

reviewed and approved by the US National Poultry Research Center Institutional Animal Care

49

and Use Committee, and the viruses were used under the approval of the Institutional Biosafety

50

Committee.

51

To evaluate their susceptibility to these viruses, 10 birds of each species were challenged

52

with either the USA-WA1/2020 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (BEI NR-58221) or the Florida/USA-

53

2_SaudiArabia_2014 isolate of MERS-CoV (BEI NR-50415), which were both obtained from

54

the Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository (BEI Resources),

55

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (full details of

56

all methods are provided in the technical appendix). Oro-pharyngeal and cloacal swabs were

57

collected from all birds at 2, 4, and 7 days post challenge (DPC) and were tested for virus by

58

real-time RT-PCR. At 14 DPC sera were collected from the birds and were tested for antibody to

59

the challenge virus by microneutralization.

60

Clinical signs were not observed at any time in any species, and virus was not detected in

61

any swab material. Antibodies were not detected in serum from any birds at 14 days post

62

challenge. These results suggest that neither virus replicated in any of the avian species evaluated

63

or replicated at a level that was too low to be detected.

64

ECE were tested for their ability to support SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV replication after

65

inoculation with any of the three most common routes: yolk sac, chorio-allantoic sac and chorio-

66

allantoic membrane (see technical appendix for details). Yolk, allantoic fluid/albumin, and

67

embryo tissues were collected from inoculated eggs and tested for viral replication by attempting

68

virus isolation in Vero cells from the egg material after each of 2 ECE passages. Neither virus

69

was recovered in Vero cells from the inoculated ECEs and lesions were not observed in any of

70

the embryos inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV.

71

Identifying potential reservoir hosts of the novel coronaviruses is critical to controlling

72

exposure and subsequent infection, as well as to preserving a safe and consistent food supply.

73

None of the avian species evaluated here, nor ECE appeared to support replication of either

74

virus. Therefore, poultry are unlikely to serve a role in the maintenance or transmission of either

75

SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV. Further, ECE are not a viable laboratory host system.
