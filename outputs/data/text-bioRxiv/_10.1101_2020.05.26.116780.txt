Abstract
Microarray data from SARS CoV2 patients helps to construct a gene network relating to this
disease. Analysis of these genes, present in network, highlights their biological functions and
related cellular pathways. With the assistance of these information, a drug(s) can be identified to
treat COVID-19. A detailed analysis of the human host response to SARS CoV 2 with expression
profiling by high throughput sequencing has executed with primary human lung epithelium cell
lines. Clustered genes annotation and gene network construction are performed with the help of
String database. Among four cluster of genes from microarray data, cluster 1 is identified as basal
cells with p= 1.37e-05 with 44 genes. Functional enrichment analysis of genes present in gene
network has completed using String database, ToppFun online tool and NetworkAnalyst tool. For
SARS CoV2 virus particles, keratin proteins, which are part of cytoskeleton structure of host cell,
play a major role in cell to cell virus particle transmission. Among three types of cell- cell
communication, only anchoring junction between basal cell membrane and basal lamina, is
involved in this virus transmission. In this junction point, hemidesmosome structure play a vital
role in virus spread from one cell to basal lamina in respiratory tract. In this protein complex
structure, keratin, integrin and laminin proteins of host cell is used to promote the spread of virus
infection into extracellular matrix. So, small molecular blockers of different anchoring junction
proteins i.e. ITGA3, ITGA2 can provide efficient protection against this deadly virus disease.
Understanding the human host response against this virus is very important to develop novel
therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV 2.

I. Introduction
With the help of microarray data from a sample in a single experiment become a powerful tool for
analyzing genes, responsible for a particular disease. The result of that specific condition with
microarray experiment ultimately summarized in a list of genes of interest. These genes are
expressed differentially in normal and diseased conditions [1]. Analysis of these genes of interest

in terms of their biological functions and cellular pathways e.g. metabolic, signaling etc., helps us
to identify drugs to treat this specific disease. Gene network regarding any disease means a graph
with genes as vertices and edges represent relationship between genes with the help of their
biological functions.
Understanding the human host response against this virus is very important to develop novel
therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV 2. Similar to that of other coronaviruses, this SARSCoV 2 also causes mild to severe respiratory tract infection with very high global mortality rate
[2]. Comparing differentially expressed genes in different cell lines such as primary human lung
epithelium (NHBE), transformed lung alveolar (A549) cells in lung adenocarcinoma, lung biopsy
cells from both normal and COVID-19 patients [3], a gene network can be constructed.
Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells is a complex structure, composed of ciliated,
non-ciliated, goblet cells and basal cells. Bronchial epithelium can be considered as a barrier
against various allergens, bacteria, viruses and pollutants in between airspace and internal system
of lungs and causes inflammatory response as a part of innate immunity. Immunomodulatory role
of NHBE cells can be correlated with their expression of cytokines, growth factors and adhesion
molecules. During this inflammatory response, leucocyte recruitment from blood increases and
within bronchi by altering cell apoptosis, survival of inflammatory cells is also increased [4]. Other
than cytokines, activated epithelial cells also secret leukotrienes, prostaglandins and extracellular
matrix components. Thus, epithelial cells also provide an adaptive immune response against
infections (viruses, bacteria and fungi), allergens and air pollutants. This is the preliminary
mechanism for antigen neutralization and elimination.
All viruses employ specific mechanisms for their attachment with host cells. During virus-host
interactions different classes of biomolecules are responsible for invasion and replication of
viruses inside the host cells [5]. Replication of viruses is obstructed by cillia, glycolyx and
immunoglobulins. Viruses enter through the epithelium layers in respiratory system by using
components of cell-cell adhesion structures [6].
II. Methodology
i)

Protein from microarray dataset analyzed and used for construction of a proteinprotein network
a) Processing of microarray dataset

An in-depth analysis of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 with expression profiling by high
throughput sequencing has executed with different cell lines such as primary human lung
epithelium (NHBE), transformed lung alveolar (A549) cells and transformed lung-derived Calu3 cells, in normal conditions and infected with SARS-CoV-2 [3] and deposited as
GSE147507_RawReadCounts_Human.tsv.gz file in Series GSE147507 in GEO (Gene Expression
Omnibus) [7].
Analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data with GSE147507_RawReadCounts_Human is
performed using alona [8] as follows:
1. Quality filtering

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.26.116780; this version posted May 26, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

Uninformative genes are deleted by requiring each gene to be expressed in 1% of cells. Doublet
detection is performed in this step using the Scrublet package [9].
2. Normalization
Standard normalization procedure by scaling with the total read depth per cell and then multiplying
with a scaling factor is used.
3. Highly variable genes (HVG) detection
Highly variable genes (HVG) are discovered using a Seurat-like strategy, utilizing binning of
genes according to average expression [10]. Here, HVG number is 1000 for this analysis.
4. Dimensionality reduction.
Principal component (PC) analysis is performed on the HVG with the method described by
Baglama and Reichel (2005) [11] with the default setting is to identify 40 PCs. 2d embedding
method is completed on PCs with tDistributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) [12] with
perplexity is set to 30.
5. Clustering
The principal components are searched for k nearest neighbors using the BallTree algorithm. A
shared nearest neighbor graph, with weights as the number of shared neighbors, is created. Cell
clusters are documented from the graph with the Leiden [13] algorithm.
For Leiden algorithm, cluster resolution is set to 0.6 (lesser value means larger clusters and vice
versa).
6. Cell type annotation.
Annotation of cell types is performed at the cluster level [14]. Gene expression in clusters is
characterized by taking the median across all cells. The procedure evaluates gene expression
activity of a set of marker genes and ultimately ranks the resulting cell types. Significance is
calculated by figuring a one-sided Fisherâ€™s exact test for each cell type and adjusting p-values with
the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Thus, when the adjusted p-value is higher than 0.1, the cell
type is marked with an "Unknown" annotation.
7. Differential gene expression identification
This step includes all-versus-all cluster assessments; i.e., every gene is compared between every
pair of clusters. Here, linear models followed by t-tests, similar to the limma R package [15] is
used to generate the initial set of comparisons.

b) Gene network with String with clustered genes
Clustered genes are annotated and gene network is constructed by using String database [16].

ii)

Gene enrichment analysis with gene cluster present in protein-protein network

ToppFun [17], an online tool is used for functional enrichment analysis based on transcriptome,
ontology, phenotype, proteome, and pharmacome annotations.
Detection of functional enrichment of forty-four gene list based on Transcriptome, Proteome,
Regulome (TFBS and miRNA), Ontologies (GO, Pathway), Phenotype (human disease and mouse
phenotype), Pharmacome (Drug-Gene associations), literature co-citation, and other features is
performed.

In this network (Figure 3) number of nodes are 44, number of edges are 59 with average node
degree is 2.68. Here, avg. local clustering coefficient is 0.372 with expected number of edges is
8. PPI enrichment p-value for this network is< 1.0e-16.
c) Functional enrichment of protein present in gene network using String database
Functional enrichment in gene network according to String database [16] considering the
biological process show that 11 genes are related with cell adhesion process, 14 genes are related
to skin development and 13 genes are involved in epidermis development process. 12 genes are
related with epithelium development. Interestingly, 10 genes are involved in keratinocyte
differentiation biological process.

Figure 4 Virus entry point through respiratory system

Three molecular functions such as cell adhesion molecule binding (6 genes), structural constituent
of cytoskeleton (5 genes e.g. KRT14, KRT17, KRT5, KRT15, KRT6B) and integrin binding (4
genes such as ILK, ITGB6, ITGA2 and ITGA3) are important in function enrichment analysis. 6
genes are present in both anchoring junction and intermediate filament whereas in integrin
complex 4 genes are present. ILK, ITGB6, ITGA2, GYPC, PKP3, CDH3 are present in anchoring
junction. Genes with molecular functions, known as cell adhesion molecule binding, are GYPC,
ITGA3, ITGA2, ITGB6, ILK, PKP3. Among forty-four genes, present in network, only 7 genes
i.e. NNMT, ITGA3, ITGA2, CDH3, BCL2, BNIP3 and FBXO32, show response to drug.
According to KEGG pathway analysis, 9 genes that are MYLK, IKL, LAMC2, ITGB6, ITGB4,
ITGA2, LAMB3, ITGA3 and BCL2 are present in hsa04510 pathway, which is known as focal
adhesion pathway. Similarly, 7 genes namely, LAMC2, ITGB6, ITGA2, ITGB4, ITGA3, LAMB3,
BCL2, are participated in PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (KEGG pathway ID hsa 04151).

Considering reactome pathway (Reactome ID HAS-446107), 5 genes i.e. LAMC2, ITGB4,
LAMB3, KRT14 and KRT5, are present in type I hemidesmosome assembly. Hemidesmosomes
(HDs) are specialized multiprotein junctional complexes, present as cell junction organization in
cell- cell communication system. HDs connect the keratin cytoskeleton of epithelial cells to the
extracellular matrix to maintain the tissue structure and integrity [18]. These complexes mediate
adhesion of epithelial cells to the underlying basement membrane in different types of epithelia
[19].

involved in virus-host interactions in different viral diseases. For example, human papilloma virus
induces some changes in the organizational structures of anchoring junctions. Proteins (LAMC2,
LAMB3, ITBB6, ITGA2, ITGA3, ITGB4) present in anchoring junctions of epithelial cells, are
related with KEGG pathway of human papillomavirus infection (KEGG pathway ID hsa 05165).
Rotavirus and hepatitis C virus (HCV) spread through tight junctions, which is another type of cell
junction of human body. Similarly, human immune deficiency virus (HIV) penetrates through the
epithelial barrier by damaging gap junctions [20].
The precise entry point of virus in cellular entry can be predicted as target for possible therapeutics
against viral infection. Blockers of theses anchoring junction proteins i.e. ITGA3, ITGA2 can
provide protection against SARS-CoV 2 infection. Six genes i.e. LAMC2, ITGA3, ITGB4,
LAMB3, KRT14 and KRT5, in this network, are related with epidermolysis bullosa (UniProt
Keyword Id KW-0263). Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of inherited connective tissue diseases,
characterized by multiple blisters on skin and respiratory and gastrointestinal tract mucosa. But till
now no evidence of COVID-19 infection with epidermolysis bullosa patient has been reported.
Six intermediate filament proteins i.e. KRT14, KRT17, KRT5, KRT15, KRT6B, KRT23 are
proteins which are primodial components of the cytoskeleton and the nuclear envelop, with
filamentous structures [21]. For many viral infections intermediate filaments play novel role during
infection. For example, parovirus minute virus of mice (MVM) intermediate filament has been
altered. Vimentin, which is an example of intermediate filament, participates in cell adhesion,
related with several viral diseases such as SARS-CoV, dengue, African swine fever etc [22].
Different pathogens e.g. herpes simplex virus, human papilloma virus type 16, adenovirus,
rotavirus, rhinovirus, can cause keratin intermediate filament network disruption. In HPV
infection, keratins are hyperphosphorylated and ubiquitinylated causing keratin network collapse,
resulting increased release of viral particles for further infection. Thicker keratin filament and
disruption in keratin network occur in herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection. Keratin
network disruption is also related with cell lysis of host cell and release of mature virus particles
during human rhinovirus infection [23].
d) Gene enrichment analysis with gene cluster present in protein-protein network using ToppFun
tool
Probability density function is the p value method for gene list enrichment analysis with ToppFun
[17], online tool. ToppFun analysis result shows that among forty-four genes, 10 proteins from 10
genes (KRT23, KRT5, KRT6B, SERINC2, KRT14, KRT15, KRT17, SPHK1, PKP3 and CAPN1)
have transferase activity for transferring acyl groups (GO:0016746). Except SERINC2 and
SPHK1, other eight proteins are related with glutamine gamma-glutamyl transferase activity
(GO:0003810). 9 genes are present as cellular component of anchoring junction. These genes are
PLAU, ITGA2, ILK, ITGA3, CDH, ITGB4, ITGB6, PKP3 and CAPN1. Genes related with
different pathways are summarized in Table 2.

e) Gene annotation by NetworkAnalyst
By using NetworkAnalyst tool [24], a network is drawn (Figure 4) for gene enrichment analysis
on the basis of KEGG pathway. Focal adhesion pathway has the highest p value (7.957E-9 ). The
genes which are present in focal adhesion pathway are LAMB3, LAMC2, BCL2, ITGA2, ILK,
ITGA3, MYLK, ITGB4 and ITGB6. According to Wilkipathways at the cell-extracellular matrix
contact points, a specialized structure, known as focal adhesion is formed. Here actin filament
bundles are attached with integrin family protein. Similarly, proteins from genes LAMB3,
LAMC2, BCL2, ITGA2, ITGA3, ITGB4 and ITGB6, are present in PI3K-Akt signaling pathway
(Table 3). During viral infection, this pathway is an important mechanism through which virus
influences various cell functions of the host. For example, apoptosis is slowed down and virus
replication process is prolonged using this pathway [25]. Thus, virus particles are hijacking the
PI3K-Akt signaling pathway of the host cell.

In earlier studies Mizutani et al, 2004, have proved that SARS-CoV coronavirus infection,
PI3K/Akt pathway is activated in virus-infected cells [26]. Similarly, for Middle East Respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), kinase inhibitors targeting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, are
considered as potential antiviral agents in MERS-CoV infection [27].

IV. Discussion
In respiratory tract infection, epithelial cell layer can act as a first line of defense in innate immune
response. Among different types of cells, ciliated cells which are attached with basal membrane
through basal cells, can be considered as the entry point of SARS CoV2 viral infection. This virus
particles enter into the human host cells through the binding to the cell surface receptor protein
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [28]. Surface binding spike protein of virus mediates its
entry by binding with host membrane receptor protein. After entry inside the host cell in human,
virus particles move via endosome formation and finally fuse with lysosomal membranes. Then,
envelop protein of virus particles disrupt and their genetic material, RNA released into the host
cell. By using replication machinery of host cell, more virus particles are generated.
Virus particles can spread through the host body by two distinct methods. First method is diffusion
through extracellular matrix and the second one is by using direct cell to cell contact [29]. Viruses
which are transmitted across tight cell to cell contacts, are reached to neighborhood cells and
extracellular matrix via host cell surface receptors. Thus, their binding efficiency and entry inside
the host cell are increased manifolds. For SARS CoV2 virus particles, keratin proteins, which are
part of cytoskeleton structure of host cell, play a major role in cell to cell transmission. Basal cell
of epithelial cell layer is attached with basal membrane through cell to cell junction points. Among
three junction points in cell to cell contact in human body, in SARS CoV2 infection, only
anchoring junction between basal cell membrane and basal lamina, is involved in virus

transmission. In this junction point, hemidesmosome structure play a vital role in virus spread from
one cell to basal lamina in respiratory tract. Integrin proteins which binds to laminin proteins, are
present in extracellular matrix, form hemidesmosome structure. Thus, focal adhesion pathway is
affected in this cell to cell virus transmission. Although HCV and HIV viruses, transmit through
tight junctions and gap junctions but SARS CoV2 virus transmits by using anchoring junction
points. Here, keratin, integrin and laminin proteins of host cell are used to promote the spread of
virus infection into extracellular matrix. The precise protein receptor i.e. ACE2 can be used as
target for possible therapeutics in SARS CoV2 treatment and at the time small molecular blockers
of different anchoring junction proteins i.e. ITGA3, ITGA2 can provide efficient protection against
this deadly virus disease.
