Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 viral genome contains a positive-strand single-stranded RNA of ~30 kb.
Human ACE2 protein is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus attachment and initiation of
infection. We propose to use ribonucleases (RNases) as antiviral agents to destroy the viral
genome in vitro. In the virions the RNA is protected by viral capsid proteins, membrane proteins
and nucleocapsid proteins. To overcome this protection we set out to construct RNase fusion
with human ACE2 receptor N-terminal domain (ACE2NTD). We constructed six proteins
expressed in E. coli cells: 1) MBP-ACE2NTD, 2) ACE2NTD-GFP, 3) RNase I (6xHis), 4)
RNase III (6xHis), 5) RNase I-ACE2NTD (6xHis), and 6) human RNase A-ACE2NTD150
(6xHis). We evaluated fusion expression in different E. coli strains, partially purified MBPACE2NTD protein from the soluble fraction of bacterial cell lysate, and refolded MBPACE2NTD protein from inclusion body. The engineered RNase I-ACE2NTD (6xHis) and
hRNase A-ACE2NTD (6xHis) fusions are active in cleaving COVID-19 RNA in vitro. The
recombinant RNase I (6xHis) and RNase III (6xHis) are active in cleaving RNA and dsRNA in
test tube. This study provides a proof-of-concept for construction of fusion protein between
human cell receptor and nuclease that may be used to degrade viral nucleic acids in our
environment.

Introduction
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2 or ACE-2) is a carboxypeptidase which
converts angiotensin I to angiotensin 1-9, and it catalyzes the degradation of angiotensin II to
angiotensin 1-7 (reviewed in [1; 2] ), which attenuates inflammation and oxidative stress caused
by angiotensin II. ACE2 is a glycoprotein that serves as host cell receptor for the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), human coronavirus NL63/HCoV-NL63, and
SARS-CoV-2 [3; 4]. The SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing pandemics and COVID-19
respiratory disease around the globe since its initial outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China
in December 2019 [5]. The first genome sequence was deposited in GenBank/NCBI on Jan. 13,
2020 (Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession number
NC_045512). The mortality rate among the elderly (>65) with underlying conditions is high,
while the overall fatality rate from positively diagnosed patients in the world stands at ~6.26 %
as of April 14, 2020 (120,863 death among over 1.9 million infected when this work was halffinished) [6]. For comparison, the global mortality associated with seasonal influenza epidemics
from 2002-2011 (no data in 2009) from World Health Organization was estimated at 0.00058%,
or approximately 6 in 10,000 infected individuals in all age groups [7]. Thus, COVID-19 is
approximately 10-100 times more lethal in causing human death than seasonal flu, although the
mortality rate varies from country to country depending on the medical infrastructure. In
majority of COVID-19 positive cases (estimated at ~70% to 80%), the infected individuals show
symptoms with fevers and chill, severe muscle pain, cough, symptoms of upper respiratory tract
infection and will likely recover after 2-3 weeks. However, the other 20%-30% patients require
hospitalization and roughly 5% patients become critically ill and require intensive care and some
would eventually develop severe pneumonia (acute respiratory distress syndrome),
cardiovascular damage, acute kidney injury, and catastrophic organ failure, possibly owing to
acute cytokine storm of massive host immunological reactions [8; 9; 10]. Autoantibodies against
immune cells and interferons are also associated with severe COVID-19 disease. The percentage
of asymptomatic positive carriers is unknown due to the lack of extensive antibody testing in the
general population. The soluble recombinant human ACE2 protein has been shown to drastically
reduce virus titer in cell cultures by binding to SARS-CoV-2 virus and preventing reinfection
[11].

The SARS viral spike (S) protein forms a trimer and it’s erected active form mediates
virus entry into host cells by first binding to the ACE2 receptor through the receptor-binding
domain (RBD) in the N-terminal S1 domain (the trimeric Spike protein also binds cellular
heparin). Following protease cleavage, fusion of the viral and host membranes through the S2
domain ensued by endocytosis and subsequent release of viral RNA for translation of viral
proteins, post-translational processing, viral RNA replication and modification, and virus particle
maturation in Golgi apparatus [12; 13; 14; 15]. The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 is probably very
similar to that of SARS-CoV [4; 16]. The receptor binding domain of the S protein (S-RBD)
serves as a molecular target for developing virus attachment inhibitors, therapeutic antibodies,
and preventive vaccines [17]. The structures of ACE2 receptor with bound S1 domain or fulllength S protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been solved recently at high resolution by Cryo-EM [18;
19]. Recently, COVID-19 virus variants have been isolated in UK, South Africa, Brazil, and US
that contain multiple amino acid (aa) mutations in the S protein (e.g. K417N, E484K, N501Y aa
substitutions) that may have increased the binding affinity to human ACE2 receptor and
enhanced transmission rate [20]. Another host protein, the transmembrane protease, serine 2
(TMPRSS2) is believed to cleave the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to facilitate cellular
attachment and membrane fusion [4; 21]. While cellular proteases furin and cathepsin B/L
proteases can also cleave S protein and active the virus for reinfection of other cells. The
full-length TMPRSS2 protein is 492-aa long, that can be cleaved into two polypeptides by
autocatalysis: N-terminal non-catalytic domain (aa 1-255), and C-terminal catalytic domain
(aa 256-492). The Serine protease facilitates the phylogenetically related SARS-CoV virus-cell
membrane fusions by proteolytically cleaving and processing the viral spike glycoproteins [22].
Over-expression of TMPRSS2 in human VeroE6 cells resulted in a cell line
VeroE6/TMPRSS2 highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially useful for
generating high virus titers [23].
Current strategies to reduce viral transmission among individuals are social distancing
(curfew, self-quarantine and/or mandatory shelter in place) to reduce community transmission,
chemical treatment and sanitization of public places that may harbor the viral particles, creation
of physical barriers (wearing masks, facial shield, protective goggle and gown for health care
workers). The SARS-CoV particles on smooth surfaces retained their viability for over 5 days at
22–25°C and relative humidity of 40–50%, however, virus viability was rapidly lost at higher

temperatures (>38oC) and higher relative humidity [24]. The survival of infectious SARS-CoV-2
virus particle in air droplets and solid surfaces is estimated in a few hours to days [25]. Virus
particles in the respiratory air droplets (aerosol) from asymptomatic carriers and patients are
suspected as transmission route, which resulted in high transmission rate to health care workers
in hospitals and other high density social gathering. The degradation and loss of infectivity of the
virus particles relies on natural decays of the infectious particles possibly by many
environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, pH, protease and RNase and other natural
microbial enzymes present under environmental settings. Three vaccines against SARS-CoV-2
Spike (S) protein have been developed by pharmaceutical companies and are being applied to
front line medical professionals, senior citizens, essential workers and later to the general
population [26; 27; 28; 29; 30; 31; 32]. Phase 1 clinical trial for a single dose intranasal vaccine
was initiated in Q4 2020 by Altimmune Inc. and University of Alabama/Birmingham.
Clinical trials have been carried out for treatment of COVID-19 with the nucleotide
analog RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP) inhibitor RemdesivirÒ, which has been
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19 patients. Other antiviral
drugs include protease inhibitors that inhibit the viral protease (main protease, Mpro) required
for the processing of virus polyprotein into functional enzymes (RdRP, RNA helicase, and
ribonuclease) for viral genome replication. Other host factors involved in viral replication and
maturations have been identified and are being targeted for therapeutic intervention [33]. The
overall economic fallout from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics in the global economy is difficult to
quantitate, but the pandemics had negatively impacted on economic activities and GDP, leading
to a global recession in 2020.
The E. coli MBP protein expression system utilizes a strong promoter for transcription
and a strong ribosome binding site for protein synthesis and the production of target protein is
inducible by addition of IPTG (www.neb.com)[34]. Some MBP fusion proteins can be expressed
at high level, up to 100 mg per liter (L) of induced cells. In addition, the target protein in fusion
with MBP can be exported into bacterial periplasm to avoid toxicity since over-expression of
certain enzymes in cytoplasm is toxic to the host. MBP signal peptide directed fusion protein to
periplasm (removal of MBP signal peptide). In some cases, MBP fusion with the target protein is
active and there is no need to cleave off the MBP tag for enzymatic activity (e.g. MBP-PNGase
F (NEB Catalog 2019/20), RNase If (MBP-RNase I fusion), MBP-Geobacillus intron-encoded

reverse transcriptase (Xu, unpublished). The MBP tag can also serve as a chaperon to enhance
the fusion protein solubility [34; 35]. The E. coli ribonuclease I (RNase I, periplasmic isoform)
belongs to the RNase T2/S-RNase group of endoribonucleases and it had been over-expressed
and purified [36]. Bovine RNase A and E. coli RNase I, commercially available in research
grade for many years, are widely used to eliminate RNA in preparation of plasmid and genomic
DNA for molecular biology applications [37]. E. coli RNase III is an endoribonuclease cleaving
double-stranded (ds) duplex RNA that is involved in transcript degradation and accelerated RNA
decay and it requires divalent cations for activity [37]. RNase III and its variants can generate
small dsRNA (21-23 bp) in Mn2+ buffer to be used in small RNA-medicated gene transcription
regulation [38]. The human ribonuclease A (hRNase A) has eight different secreted variants
(isoforms) that have antiviral/antibacterial/antifungal activities, and cytotoxicity against
intracellular parasites. hRNase A (pancreatic) encoded by the human rnase1 gene is an
endorinuclease cleaving the 3' side of pyrimidine nucleotides of single-stranded and doublestranded RNA [39; 40] . The hRNase A precursor contains 156 aa residues with a signal peptide
of 28 residues (128 aa mature protein, Uniprot ID-P07998). The potential of hRNase A as an
anti-Covid-19 reagent has not been explored to our knowledge.
The SARS-CoV-2 viral genome is a positive-strand ssRNA of ~30 kb possibly encoding
at least 29 viral proteins [41]. In this study, we propose to use ribonucleases (RNases) as an
antiviral agent to destroy the viral genome. Our goal is to construct RNase I fusion with human
ACE2 receptor protein and to investigate strategies to trigger the destabilization of the viral
particles or partially release the RNA genome to become more accessible to RNase degradation.
To achieve this goal, we expressed six proteins in E. coli cells: 1) MBP-ACE2NTD, 2) ACE2
NTD-GFP, 3) RNase I (6xHis), 4) RNase III (6xHis), 5) RNase I-ACE2NTD (6xHis), 6) hRNase
A-ACE2NTD. We examined expression conditions and partially purified the fusion protein
MBP-ACE2NTD. We optimized expression conditions and strains for RNase I (6xHis) and
RNase III (6xHis). We also constructed and partially purified the fusion enzyme RNase IACE2NTD (6xHis) which is active in cleaving RNA in the absence of divalent cations. We also
demonstrated that hRNase A-ACE2NTD (6xHis) fusion is active in digestion of Covid-19 RNA
fragment and other RNA substrates. We fused ACE2-NTD to GFP that resulted in reduced green
fluorescence signal. This construct may be useful to isolate more soluble variants of ACE2NTD
by screening mutant libraries. This work serves as a proof of concept for the construction of

artificial ribonuclease fused to human ACE2 receptor NTD. The availability of inexpensive
recombinant ACE2NTD protein may facilitate the screening of small molecules binding to
ACE2 and block SARS virus attachment and entry.
Materials and Methods
E. coli strains and recombinant DNA method
E. coli strains for fusion protein expression are NEB Express (B strain), NEB Turbo (K strain),
NEB SHuffleÒ T7 (K and B strains), Nico (lDE3) derived from BL21. The periplasm
expression vector pMAL-p5x (AmpR) was used for the construction of ACE2NTD fusion.
Synthetic gene blocks (gblock) with optimized E. coli codons were purchased from Integrated
DNA Technology (IDT) and cloned into the expression vector (NdeI and BamHI digested) by
NEB HiFi assembly enzyme mix (E2621S, NEB, MA) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. Assembled vector with potential insert was transferred into E. coli competent cells
by transformation. Individual AmpR transformants were picked and cultured in 2 ml of LB +
Amp and shaken at 37oC for 5-6 h. 1.5 ml of cells were spun down and kept in -20oC for plasmid
mini-preparation until needed. 10 ml of LB + Amp were added to the remaining cells and
cultured for ~2-3 h to reach late log phase. IPTG at 0.3 mM final concentration was added for
fusion protein production overnight (at 16oC to 18oC). Plasmid DNA was prepared by a
MonarchÒ mini-preparation kit (NEB). The inserts were sequenced by two primers (forward
primer S1273 from the C-terminal coding region of MBP, and a reverse primer (R2913)
downstream of the BamHI site of pMAL-p5x) with a BigDyeÒ terminator V3.1 cycle
sequencing kit (ABI/Thermo-Fisher). Amylose resin (E8021S, NEB) and amylose column
chromatography was carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Protein refolding kit
was purchased from Novagen. Proteins in pellet (inclusion body) after centrifugation (10,000 xg)
was resuspended in a solubilization buffer (10 mM CAPS, pH 11.0, 0.3% N-lauroylsarcosine)
and pelleted in a microcentrifuge (4oC). After washing the pellet with wash buffer twice (20 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) the pellet was solubilized and dialyzed
against 2 L of dialysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mM DTT) for 4 h to overnight at 4oC
with exchange of the dialysis buffer twice. A small fraction of the refolded MBP-ACE2NTD
fusion protein was further purified by amylose magnetic beads (NEB) according to the protocol
provided by the manufacturer.

Description of the amino acid (aa) sequence of MBP-ACE2NTD fusion.
The full-length ACE2 protein has 805 aa residues (GenBank sequence ID: BAB40370.1). The
first 17 aa residues form the signal peptide not required for activity; the extracellular domain is
consisted of aa residues 18-740 [42]. Therefore, only the coding sequence for aa residues 12 to
444 is synthesized in two gene blocks (IDT) (the first 11 aa residues were deleted, #12 Val codon
was changed to ATG codon for cloning purpose. See the modified protein sequence below). The
S2 domain involved in membrane fusion is not included here.

The codon-optimized gblocks were assembled into pMAL-p5x (p for periplasmic expression),
which encodes MBP-ACE2NTD fusion with predicted molecular mass (MW) of ~94.0 kDa
(mature protein had 26-aa signal peptide removed from MBP N-terminus, 44.5 + 49.5 = 94.0
kDa). The first six aa residues (MAVTAA) serve as a short linker between MBP and ACE2NTD.
SARS-CoV-2 His-tagged Spike (S) protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD) protein of S
were purchased from Sino Biological (Beijing/China and Wayne/USA).
Construction of ACE2NTD-GFP fusion
The coding sequence for ACE2NTD was amplified by PCR and inserted into pDasherGFP (NdeI
cut, pBR322 backbone, AmpR)(source reference: atum.bio). GFP expression was under the
control of T5 promoter and is inducible by addition of IPTG. GFP expressing colonies, GFP and
ACE2NTD-GFP protein bands were visualized under long UV light or by a fluorescence imager
(Typhoon, GE Lifesciences) at 520 nM (Cy2 channel, 515-535 nm emission).

Cloning of E. coli RNase I coding sequence into pET21b with a C-terminal 6xHis tag and
construction of RNase I-ACE2NTD fusion
The RNase I gene (rna) was amplified from E. coli genomic DNA (E. coli strain H709c) and
assembled into T7 expression vector pET21b (NdeI and XhoI digested), which produced a Cterminal 6xHis tag. The protein expression level was evaluated in four T7 expression strains: T7
Express (C2566, NEB), T7 Express with LysY and lacIq (C3013, NEB), T7 SHuffle (C3026, E.
coli K strain, NEB) and Nico (lDE3) with reduced histidine-rich background proteins (NEB).
The RNase I precursor contains a signal peptide (amino acid residues 1-23) for export to
periplasm. To create RNase I-ACE2NTD fusion, a PCR fragment amplified from ACE2NTD
gene block (IDT) was assembled into the XhoI site of pET21b-RNase I, which generated the
coding sequence for the fusion RNase I-ACE2NTD (6xHis). The entire gene was sequenced
using T7 universal primer(S1248), T7 terminator primer (reverse) (S1271), and internal ACE2
primers. The expression of RNase I-ACE2NTD (6xHis) fusion was evaluated in five T7
expression strains: C2566, C3013, C3026, Nico (lDE3), and BL21 (lDE3). RNase I (6xHis)
was partially purified by chromatography through Ni-NTA column (Ni-NTA agarose fast-flow,
ThermoFisher). The protein was concentrated by low-speed centrifugation in an Amicon
concentrator (10 kDa cut-off) and resuspended in a storage buffer SB (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,
200 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 50% glycerol).
Cloning of E. coli RNase III gene (rnc) into pET21b with a C-terminal 6xHis tag
The RNase III gene (rnc) was amplified from E. coli genomic DNA (E. coli strain H709c) and
assembled into T7 expression vector pET21b (NdeI and XhoI digested), which produced a Cterminal 6xHis tag. The protein expression level was evaluated in three T7 expression strains: T7
Express with LysY and lacIq (C3013), T7 SHuffle (C3026, E. coli K strain) and Nico (lDE3).
RNase III (6xHis) was partially purified by chromatography through Ni-NTA column (Ni-NTA
agarose fast-flow, ThermoFisher). The protein was concentrated by low-speed centrifugation in a
concentrator and resuspended in a storage buffer SB. RNase III activity was assayed using a
40mer duplex RNA and dsRNA ladder (NEB).

A PCR fragment encoding E. coli RNase I (GenBank Sequence ID: AAB40811.1) was inserted
into pMAL-p5x to generate the following construct (the 23-aa signal sequence of RNase I was
deleted). The molecular weight of the fusion protein MBP-RNase I is predicted to be ~71.7 kDa
(44.5 + 27.2 kDa).

Cloning of human RNase A gene (human rnase1) and construction of hRNaseAACE2NTD150 fusion
Two versions of fusion were constructed: fusion 1 contains the E. coli MBP signal peptide (aa
residues 1-26, this signal peptide directed the fusion protein to be exported to the periplasmic
space), and fusion 2 without the MBP signal peptide. The fusion is consisted of peptides: E. coli
MBP signal peptide (MBP residues 1-26) + hRNase A (hRNase A residues 29-156) +
ACE2NTD (ACE2 N-terminal residues 18-150, referred to as ACE2NTD150) (note: the aa

used as substrates for RNase I and RNase III activity assays. Cleavage products were analyzed
by gel electrophoresis on PAGE-Urea gel or agarose gel. 5’ FAM-labeled COVID-19 ssRNA (60
mer) was purchased from IDT. RNase I assay: 16 nM of the RNA substrate was digested by
purified MBP-RNase I, RNase I (6xHis) or refolded RNase I-ACE2NTD (6xHis) in a high salt
buffer (NEB buffer 3: 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9 at 25oC, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
DTT) or a high salt buffer without divalent cations (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1
mM DTT) as RNase I is active in the absence of divalent cations or in the presence of EDTA
[37]. Cleavage reactions were quenched by eliminating enzymes with the treatment with
Proteinase K (1.6 U, NEB) and the products were analyzed by capillary gel electrophoresis (CE
assay). Substrate and cleavage product peaks were analyzed by PeakScan software
(ABI/ThermoFisher).
Protein pull-down assays (protein complex pull-down by Ni magnetic beads)
Ni-magnetic beads pull down of His-tagged S protein in complex with MBP-ACE2NTD. Nimagnetic beads (100 µl) was washed three times with Ni binding buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 0.3
M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole). His-tagged spike protein (2 µg, purchased from Sino Biological)
was added to the beads pre-suspended in 200 µl Ni binding buffer and incubated at 4oC in a
roller for 30 min. Refolded MBP-ACE2NTD protein (10 µg) or equal volume of storage buffer
was added to the prebound Ni-beads/S protein and co-incubation continued at 4oC for 1 h. The
Ni magnetic beads were washed three times with Ni binding buffer (1 ml each time) and the

protein was eluted by addition of 50 µl of Ni elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 0.3 M NaCl, 0.25
M imidazole). Approximately 17 µl of the eluted protein was loaded onto 10-20% SDS-PAG gel
for analysis.
Amylose magnetic beads pull down of His-tagged S protein and RBD protein
NEB’s protocol for MBP protein binding to the amylose magnetic beads was used with minor
modification. Amylose magnetic beads (400 µl) in an Eppendorf tube were saturated (blocked)
in 1 ml of BSA (1x) in MBP binding buffer (200 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM
EDTA, 1 mM DTT) on a rotator at 4oC overnight. The beads were then washed 3 times (15 min
each) at 4oC with MBP binding buffer. The magnetic beads were resuspended in 200 µl of MBP
binding buffer. His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (5 µl) or His-tagged RBD protein (5 µl
at 1.75 µg/µl, purchased from Sino Biological) were first diluted in 45 µl of MBP binding buffer.
MBP-ACE2 fusion protein (25 µl at 0.98 µg/µl) were mixed with diluted Spike protein or RBD
protein and 100 µl of BSA-saturated magnetic beads. Protein binding (complex formation) was
carried out on a rotator at 4oC overnight. The beads with bound proteins were washed 3 times
with 1 ml of MBP binding buffer at 4oC for 15 min. Bound proteins were eluted with addition of
50 µl of MBP elution buffer (MBP binding buffer plus 10 mM maltose) and the eluted proteins
were analyzed by Western blot using anti-His Ab or anti-ACE2 Ab.
Western blot using anti-6xHis antibody (Ab) and mouse monoclonal anti-ACE2 Ab
Mouse monoclonal anti-ACE2 Ab and mouse anti-6xHis Ab were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technologies (CST, MA) and EMC Millipore company, respectively. Protein expression,
purification and interaction between protein partners were monitored by Western blot analysis
according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cell extract or purified proteins (6xHis tag)
were subjected to 10-20% SDS PAGE and proteins were transferred onto Protran BA85
nitrocellulose (Whatman) in a 0.5x transfer buffer. The transferred proteins were stained with
Ponceau S solution (Sigma-Aldrich). The nitrocellulose membrane was soaked (blocked) in 3%
milk (dry milk from Bio-Rad) solution in 1x PBS following by incubation with appropriate
primary antibody solution (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The excess primary
antibodies were washed off with 1x PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.1% Triton X100 three
times for 15 min, followed by incubation with secondary anti-mouse IgG HPR conjugated
antibodies (1:1000) (CST) and secondary Ab, washed three times with 1x PBS, 0.1% Tween20

Results and Discussion
Expression and purification of MBP-ACE2NTD fusion protein
A schematic diagram of the fusion consisting of an N-terminal MBP and a C-terminal
ACE2NTD as well as the cloning sites is shown in Fig. 1A. Total cellular proteins from
sonicated cell lysate of IPTG-induced cells (NEB Express, 16oC overnight) were analyzed by
SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). Nine out of 11 clones produced a strong protein band of ~94 kDa, close to
the predicted size. Clone #8 contains the correct sequence and was chosen for further analysis.
After 15 min centrifugation of the total lysate in a microcentrifuge, however, most of the MBPACE2NTD fusion was found in the pellet (inclusion body) (data not shown). To improve protein
folding and solubility, NEB SHuffle E. coli host was tested for protein induction. This strain was
engineered to promote disulfide bond formation in the cytoplasm and is deficient in proteases
Lon and OmpT. 1 L cell culture was induced with IPTG at 16oC overnight and the supernatant of
cell lysates (the soluble fraction) was loaded onto a 15 ml amylose column. Fig. 1C shows the
partially purified fusion protein using an amylose column (~6 mg protein purified from 1 liter
LB of IPTG-induced cells including a few contaminating proteins). The ~40 kDa protein is likely
to be the host MBP without the signal peptide. To remove this major contaminating protein, an
MBP-deficient SHuffle strain will be required. Some fusion protein expressed in NEB SHuffle
strain was found in the pellet (Fig. 1C, lane 4). The protein pellet from NEB Express cells was
solubilized. After solubilization and refolding, the fusion protein was partially purified (Fig. 1C,
lane 5). The protein yield from solubilized pellet (NEB Express) was approximately 50 mg/L of
IPTG-induced cells. The refolded protein can be further purified by incubation with amylose
magnetic beads (Fig. 1D). It was concluded that most of the fusion protein made in NEB Express
was found in the pellet (inclusion body). 1 L of IPTG-induced NEB SHuffle cells produced ~6
mg of soluble protein and ~50 mg of insoluble protein in the pellet. The production of MBPACE2NTD protein from E. coli cells may have a cost advantage over ACE2 protein produced
from human cell cultures. But the ACE2NTD from bacterial source lacks the sugar modifications
compared to the human version.

MBP-ACE2NTD binding to Spike (S) protein and receptor binding domain (RBD) of S protein
One potential application of MBP-ACE2NTD protein is to serve as a decoy to bind SARS-CoV2. We examined MBP-ACE2NTD binding to S and RBD protein in vitro by protein pull-down
assay. The His-tagged S protein is expected to bind to the Ni magnetic beads. The MBPACE2NTD protein was incubated with the S protein pre-bound to the Ni magnetic beads. After
extensive washing with high salt buffer, the S protein and potential bound partner were eluted
with an elution buffer. In a control experiment, approximately 20% of the S protein can be
recovered from the Ni magnetic beads (Suppl. Fig. S1 A. compared lanes 1-input and lane 2recovered). When the S protein was incubated with MBP-ACE2NTD protein, only a very weak
band of the binding partner was recovered, indicating poor binding of S protein to MBPACE2NTD in vitro under the high salt condition (0.3 M NaCl). In a reversed pull-down assay,
the MBP-ACE2NTD bound to the amylose magnetic beads was incubated with S or RBD
proteins. After extensive washing, the proteins were eluted with a maltose buffer. Only a weak
band of the S protein was detected by anti-6xHis Ab in the Western blot (Suppl. Fig. S1 B). The
RBD protein binds to the binding partner modestly well, as detected by anti-6xHis Ab in the
Western blot. In the control experiment, MBP-ACE2NTD was detected by monoclonal antiACE2 Ab. The protein binding and pull-down results indicate that the SARS-Cov-2 S protein
binds poorly to the MBP-ACE2NTD protein, and the RBD protein binds reasonably well to the
fusion in vitro. This result is consistent with published data that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein,
unlike SARS-CoV-1 S protein, is a poor binder to the human ACE2 receptor in vitro [18; 19;
42]. It remains to be seen whether some recent SARS-CoV-2 variants (e.g. N501Y, P681H, and
DH69/DV70 variants, P.1 variant with K417T/E484K/N501Y amino acid changes in S protein)
with higher transmission rate can bind to the ACE2 receptor protein more tightly in vitro [20]
(P.1 variant reference: https://virological.org/t/sars-cov-2-reinfection-by-the-new-variant-ofconcern-voc-p-1-in-amazonas-brazil/596).
ACE2NTD-GFP fusion
Since ACE2NTD fusion to MBP displayed reduced solubility, it is anticipated that fusion of
ACE2NTD to GFP may reduce green fluorescence. ACE2NTD-GFP fusion was constructed by
insertion of ACE2NTD coding sequence into the GFP expression vector, creating N-terminal
ACE2NTD and C-terminal GFP. GFP-expressing E. coli cells (IPTG-induced) showed strong

green fluorescence and formed green colonies under long UV light or at 520 nm light emission
(Suppl. Fig. S2 A). The ACE2NTD-GFP expression cells (IPTG-induced NEB Express and T7
Express), however, did not show green fluorescence, presumably the ACE2NTD-GFP fusion
negatively affected the protein folding and/or expression inside cells. IPTG induced expression
of ACE2NTD-GFP fusion showed a weak green fluorescence in NEB SHuffle cells, suggesting
improvement of folding of the fusion protein. To further confirm this, the total proteins from
IPTG induced cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and protein bands were visualized on a
fluorescence imager. GFP showed a strong fluorescence signal, but the ACE2NTD-GFP fusion
protein showed a weak signal in NEB SHuffle K and B strains (Suppl. Fig. S2 B) (the
fluorescence signal presumably resulted from protein refolding after washing three times in
Milli-Q water). It was concluded that ACE2NTD likely negatively affected the folding and/or
expression of GFP when they were fused together. This fusion system may be used to isolate
ACE2NTD variants with improved folding and stronger fluorescence in E. coli from ACE2NTD
mutant libraries by simply screening for green colonies among thousands of transformants. It has
been shown before that membrane protein fusion to GFP can create fusion problem for GFP with
reduced fluorescence [43]. GFP-expressing cell suspensions and lysate (IPTG-induced) showed a
yellow/green color under normal light (Suppl. Fig. S2C, D).
Expression of MBP-RNase A (bovine) and MBP-RNase I fusions
A schematic diagram of the E. coli RNase I and bovine RNase A fusion with MBP is shown in
Fig. 2A. The fusion proteins should be exported to the periplasm and the MBP signal peptide
being cleaved, but some fusion proteins could exist in the cytoplasm due to the protein overexpression and overwhelming of the export system. Analysis of four cell lysates (total proteins)
from NEB Express indicated a strong induced band of 55 to 60 kDa in three out of four samples,
in close agreement with the predicted MBP-RNase A fusion (58.3 kDa) (Fig. 2B). The inserts in
plasmid clones (#1, #3, and #4) were sequenced to confirm the correct DNA sequence. After
centrifugation, most of the fusion protein was pelleted, and a small fraction was found in the
supernatant (Fig. 2C, D). Attempt to transfer the MBP-RNase A expression clone into NEB
SHuffle strain was not successful (few colonies were found in transformation, data not shown),
suggesting the fusion protein may be toxic to the host. Bovine RNase A is a single-strand
specific enzyme, but at high concentrations it can cleave dsRNA as well [44]. Its over-expression

in T7 SHuffle cells appeared to be lethal to the host. A signal peptide may be added to bovine
RNase A to be exported to periplasm for its over-expression in E. coli. Due to the low yield of
soluble MBP-RNase A (bovine) fusion, the purification was not pursued further.
A PCR fragment encoding the E. coli RNase I was inserted into the pMAL-p5x vector to
construct MBP-RNase I fusion. Analysis of 11 cell lysates (total proteins) from IPTG-induced
cells (NEB Express) indicated a strong induced band of ~70 kDa in 8 out of 11 samples, in
agreement with the predicted MW (71.7 kDa) (Fig. 2C, Suppl. Fig. S3). After centrifugation,
most of the fusion protein was found in the pellet, and a small fraction remained in the
supernatant (Fig. 2C, D). Attempt to express the fusion in T7 SHuffle cells did not improve the
expression level (data not shown). MBP-RNase I fusion appeared to be toxic to T7 SHuffle host
since only low-density cells could be obtained in liquid culture at 37oC. The protein yield of
MBP-RNase I was highest in NEB Turbo cells, probably due to the robust cell growth and higher
cell weight per liter culture. Fig. 2E shows the partially purified MBP-RNase I fusion in
comparison with RNase If, (RNase If = MBP-RNase I fusion from NEB as a research grade
ribonuclease, M0243S). The enzyme preparation also contained the host MBP. In order to
eliminate the MBP, it will be necessary to use an MBP-deficient strain as the expression host. In
a ribonuclease activity assay, the partially purified MBP-RNase I is active in digestion of a
RNase substrate (fluorescein-labeled 300 nt RNA) (Fig. 2F).
Previous studies showed that E. coli RNase I does not require divalent cations for
nuclease activity, and the other eight ribonucleases from E. coli are only active in the presence of
divalent cations [37]. To demonstrate the ribonuclease activity for the partially purified MBPRNase I, we incubated a low range ssRNA ladder (N0364S, NEB) with the enzyme (3 enzyme
dilutions at 2 µg, 0.2 µg, and 0.02 µg) in a high salt buffer supplemented with EDTA, Ni2+, Ca2+,
Mn2+, Co2+, or Mg2+. MBP-RNase I is most active in Ca2+, Mn2+, and Co2+ buffers. It is also active
in EDTA, Ni2+, and Mg2+ buffers, but with limited digestion at low enzyme input (Suppl. Fig.
S4A). It is possible that in Ca2+, Mn2+, and Co2+ buffers, MBP-RNase I activity is stimulated at
the low enzyme concentration. It was concluded that MBP-RNase I fusion can be expressed at
moderate level in NEB Turbo and NEB Express cells. A small fraction of the fusion protein was
found in the soluble fraction and can be purified by chromatography through amylose column.

The partially purified fusion is active in digestion of RNA in the absence of divalent cations or in
the presence of EDTA.
Expression and purification of E. coli RNase I (6xHis)
To improve the expression level of RNase I, we also expressed a C-terminal 6xHis-tagged
version. E. coli rna gene was inserted into the T7 expression vector pET21b. Its expression level
was compared in two T7 expression strains (T7 Express and Nico (lDE3). E. coli RNase I has its
own signal peptide to be exported to periplasm. But we detected two versions in over-expression:
RNase I precursor with the signal peptide in cytoplasm and the mature enzyme without the signal
peptide. The proteins eluted from C2529 cell lysate contained fewer contaminating proteins than
C2566 cells, due to the knock-out mutations of a few Histidine-rich proteins in C2529 (Fig. 3A).
Two versions of RNase I appeared to be co-purified: a longer cytoplasmic version (cRNase I)
with the signal peptide (precursor, 30 kDa), and the shorter version of the periplasmic form (27
kDa). The partially purified enzyme is active in digestion of FAM-labeled COVID-19 RNA (60
mer) in a high salt buffer in the absence of MgCl2. We also tested the ribonuclease activity in the
presence and absence of divalent cations. RNase I (6xHis) is active in the presence of 10 mM
EDTA. The RNase activity is mostly active in buffers with Ca2+, Mn2+, or Co2+ at low enzyme
concentration (data not shown).
Expression and purification of E. coli RNase III (6xHis)
Since the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome also contains regions of dsRNA (e.g. RNA hairpin stem
loops structures, frame shift element) (reference: RJ Andrews et al. (bioRxiv. Preprint. 2020 Apr
18. doi: 10.1101/2020.04.17.045161), RNase III may be needed to digest the duplex RNA
sequences. The E. coli rnc gene encoding RNase III was cloned into pET21b to generate a Cterminal 6xHis-tagged protein. RNase III expression level after IPTG induction was examined in
three T7 expression strains: T7 SHuffle (C3026), T7 Express with LysY and lacIq (C3013) and
Nico (lDE3) (C2529). Fig. 4A shows the expression levels (soluble fractions/supernatant) in the
three strains. RNase III (6xHis) was partially purified from a Nickel-NTA agarose column or Ni
magnetic beads (Fig. 4B). It is active in digestion of a 40mer RNA duplex and dsRNA ladder.
The 40mer duplex RNA and dsRNA ladder were digested into smaller fragments as detected in
the agarose gel (Fig. 4C). In a control experiment, the ShortCut RNase III (MBP-RNase III

fusion) also digested the RNA substrates and gave rise to similar shortened fragments. It was
concluded that RNase III (6xHis) can be expressed in E. coli at high level and it is not toxic to E.
coli T7 expression strains. The expression level is comparable in the three strains tested.
Expression and purification of RNase I-ACE2 (6xHis) fusion protein
Since our constructs of MBP-ACE2NTD and RNases were shown to be folded and soluble, we
next sought to generate the fusion protein that can bind S protein and exhibit cleavage activity.
The RNase I-ACE2NTD (6xHis) fusion was expressed in Nico (lDE3). Most of the fusion was
found in the inclusion body and only a small fraction was found in the supernatant as detected by
anti-6xHis Ab or anti-ACE2 monoclonal Ab in Western blot and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5A and B,
Suppl. Fig. S5). The RNase I-ACE2NTD (6xHis) fusion pellet was subjected to a refolding
procedure and further purified by binding to Ni magnetic beads or Ni spin column (Fig. 5C). The
refolded fusion protein is active in digestion of a 300-nt RNA substrate (Fig. 5D), similar to the
positive controls RNase I (6xHis) and MBP-RNase I. The fusion enzyme purified through Ni
magnetic beads and spin column is also active in digestion of COVID-19 RNA (60 mer) (Fig.
5E). We have not tested the ribonuclease activity on full-length COVID-19 RNA due to local
bio-safety regulation on the virus.
Expression and purification of hRNase A-ACE2NTD150 fusion with and without export
signal peptide
A schematic diagram of fusion of hRNase A with ACE2NTD150 (a shorter version of
ACE2NTD) is shown in Fig. 6A. A short linker (GSAGSA) is inserted between the fusion
partners. hRNase A’s native signal peptide was deleted and MBP signal peptide was added. The
second clone does not carry any signal peptide (cytoplasmic version). The over-expressed
fusions could be detected in IPTG-induced cell lysate (total proteins) as shown in Fig. 6B. The
two fusions appeared as closely migrated doublet. It may have something to do with multiple
disulfide bonds in hRNase A (8 Cys residues in total, potentially forming 4 disulfide bonds).
With protein loading dye, DTT and heating before SDS-PAGE, some of the disulfide bonds may
be reduced to -SH groups, creating a mixture of isoforms with different secondary structures (SS vs -SH). Another possibility is that export systems are overwhelmed and some of the protein
with signal peptide is not secreted. To confirm the identity of the engineered fusion, we perform

Western blot using mouse anti-His Ab and anti-ACE2 monoclonal Ab. Fig. 6C shows the
soluble fusion proteins detected by the antibodies. There are some minor degradation products
from the fusions as detected by the anti-ACE2 Ab. We also tested fusion expression level in
Nico (lDE3) and NEB SHuffle T7 (B strain). hRNase A-ACE2NTD150 fusions with or without
the MBP signal peptide can be over-expressed in Nico (lDE3) cells (data not shown). However,
hRNase A-ACE2NTD150 fusion expression is toxic to the Shuffle strain: hRNase AACE2NTD150 with signal peptide formed small colonies in transformation of T7 SHuffle. No
transformants were found with plasmid carrying the coding sequence for hRNase AACE2NTD150 (DS, lacking MBP signal peptide). This result is similar to the toxic effect by
MBP-RNase A (bovine) in transformation of T7 SHuffle (K strain).
Most of the hRNase A-ACE2NTD150 fusions (with or without MBP signal peptide) were
found in the pellet following centrifugation (data not shown). However, there are still some
soluble fusions in the supernatant. The fusion protein hRNase A-ACE2NTD150 (6xHis) (no
signal peptide) was partially purified by chromatography through a Ni-NTA agarose column or
binding to Ni magnetic beads (Fig. 7A). The purified fusion proteins were active in cleaving
FAM-labeled COVID-19 RNA (60mer) (Fig. 7B). The substrate RNA completely disappeared
after 30 min digestion (at 0.1 µg to 2 µg of the fusion protein). Both RNA substrates and
cleavage products were detected after digestion at the lower enzyme concentration (at 1.25 to 10
ng) (Fig. 7B). Some smaller cleavage products less than 10 nt were not easily detected in the CE
assay. To further confirm the ribonuclease activity, we digested a 300-nt RNA and a ssRNA
ladder (low MW). Both RNA substrates were degraded by the fusion enzyme as detected on a
6% PAG-urea gel and staining with SYBR green (Fig. 7C). It was concluded that the fusion
enzyme hRNase A-ACE2NTD150 displays ribonuclease activity on both 60mer COVID-19
RNA and other RNA substrates ranging from 50-1000 nt. We have not tested ribonuclease
activity on the full-length SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. The binding affinity to RBD domain of the
Spike protein remains to be tested.
The fusion protein expression and purification conditions and activity assays on RNA
substrates are summarized in Table 1.

Discussion
This work demonstrated that MBP-ACE2NTD, MBP-RNase I, RNase I (6xHis), RNase III
(6xHis), RNase I-ACE2NTD (6xHis), hRNase A-ACE2NTD150 can be expressed in E. coli
either as soluble protein or refolded protein from inclusion bodies. We tested a number of E. coli
expression strains and found that MBP-ACE2NTD expression was partially soluble in T7
SHuffle strain, while RNase I-ACE2NTD (6xHis) fusion was best expressed in Nico (lDE3) or
BL21 (lDE3) as refolded protein from inclusion body. RNase I (6xHis) and RNase III (6xHis)
expressions were more comparable among the T7 expression strains tested in this work. The
over-expression of MBP-RNase A (bovine) hRNase A-ACE2NTD150 fusions, however, is toxic
to T7 SHuffle strains. We conclude from this work that different E. coli expression strains need
to be tested in order to optimize the expression condition. We only tested low temperature
induction at 16oC to 18oC and the protein induction level at higher temperatures has not been
examined. It is anticipated that protein expression level may be increased due to the higher cell
weight at the higher temperature with possible trade-off of lower protein solubility. Large-scale
fermentation and low-cost purification will be required for mass production and use of these
enzymes as anti-viral agents. Other protein expression system, for example, the yeast expression
system could be used to over-express human ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2. In addition, human
ACE2 receptor protein and the serine protease can be expressed and exported to the surface of
bacteria and yeast for cell surface display [45]. Homing endonuclease variants have been
expressed and selected successfully in yeast surface display; the engineered endonuclease
mutants displayed altered specificities with a range of cleavage activities in vitro [46]. The
fusion of ACE2NTD to E. coli FimH protein to display on the cell surface did not generate
positive results in our preliminary study: the fusion coding sequence can be constructed in DNA
level, but no fusion protein was detected by anti-6xHis Ab to detect FimH signal peptideACE2NTD-FimH (6xHis) fusion. Presumably the fusion is toxic to the host cell.
The ACE2NTD-GFP fusion may be used as a bio-sensor if more soluble ACE2NTD
variants could be isolated. The tight binding of COVID-19 variants to the ACE2NTD-GFP
fusion may alter the fluorescence signal intensity.
Future research may be directed towards making full-length recombinant ACE2 receptor
from E. coli with co-expression of chaperon proteins to increase solubility (chaperone plasmid
set, Takara Bio)[47]. In a previous work, we found co-expression of E. coli GroEL/ES proteins

with GmrSD endonuclease greatly improved the solubility of GmrSD [48]. To reduce protein
purification cost, expression of RNase I-ACE2 (6xHis) and hRNase A-ACE2 (6xHis) fusions
may be carried out using the K. lactis yeast expression system (NEB) to export the recombinant
proteins into the culture medium for industrial production of the fusions.
Other SARS-CoV-2 structure proteins and human membrane proteins (e.g. TMPRSS2
serine protease catalytic domain) or furin protease may be added to the recombinant protein
mixture to trigger virus binding and viral RNA release (TMPRSS2 and Furin cleave SARS-CoV2 S protein into S1 and S2 domains). Use of mild detergent, EDTA, and proteases may also
destabilize the infectious virus particles and partial release of viral RNA for destruction. More
research is urgently needed to validate the enzymatic approach to reduce virus counts and
transmission in air droplets and to combat highly transmissible COVID-19 variants.
It is noted that the experiments described in this work were carried out with small
fragments of RNA in vitro and that work with real virus is needed to fully evaluate the
effectiveness as an anti-viral strategy. We are actively seeking collaborations with academic labs
and government institutes.

precursor (cRNase I) with the signal peptide (predicted MW 30.7 kDa), and the periplasmic
RNase I with the signal peptide removed (predicted MW 27.0 kDa). B. RNase activity on a
FAM-labeled COVID-19 RNA (60 mer). S = substrate; P = cleavage product(s). Positive
controls, 50 and 5 U of RNase If (MBP-RNase I fusion, NEB). RNase I (6xHis) enzyme titration
(2 µg to 25 ng protein) was used in the activity assay to digest fixed amount of RNA (16 nM) in
NEB buffer 3 at 37oC for 1 h. Proteinase K (1.6 U) was added to remove RNase I. The final
cleavage products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) and peaks were visualized by
PeakScan.
