ABSTRACT

29

In recent years nidoviruses have emerged as an important respiratory pathogen of reptiles,

30

affecting especially captive python populations. In pythons, nidovirus infection induces an

31

inflammation of the upper respiratory and alimentary tract which can develop into a severe and

32

often fatal proliferative pneumonia. We observed pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic lesions

33

in organ systems other than the respiratory tract during full post mortem examinations on 30

34

nidovirus RT-PCR positive pythons of varying species originating from Switzerland and Spain.

35

The observations prompted us to study whether the atypical tissue tropism associates with

36

previously unknown nidoviruses or changes in the nidovirus genome. RT-PCR and inoculation

37

of Morelia viridis cell cultures served to recruit the cases and to obtain virus isolates.

38

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining against nidovirus nucleoprotein

39

demonstrated that the virus not only infects a broad spectrum of epithelial (respiratory and

40

alimentary epithelium, hepatocytes, renal tubules, pancreatic ducts etc.), but also intravascular

41

monocytes, intralesional macrophages and endothelial cells. By next-generation sequencing we

42

obtained full length genome for a novel nidovirus species circulating in Switzerland. Analysis of

43

viral genomes recovered from pythons showing nidovirus infection-associated respiratory or

44

systemic disease did not explain the observed phenotypes. The results indicate that python

45

nidoviruses have a broad cell and tissue tropism, further suggesting that the course of infection

46

could vary and involve lesions in a broad spectrum of tissues and organ systems as a

47

consequence of monocyte-mediated systemic spread of the virus.

IMPORTANCE

50

During the last years, python nidoviruses have become a primary cause of fatal disease in

51

pythons. Nidoviruses represent a threat to captive snake collections, as they spread rapidly and

52

can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our study indicates that, different from

53

previously evidence, the viruses do not only affect the respiratory tract, but can spread in the

54

entire body with blood monocytes, have a broad spectrum of target cells, and can induce a

55

variety of lesions. Nidovirales is an order of animal and human viruses that compromise

56

important zoonotic pathogens such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as well as the recently

57

emerged SARS-CoV-2. Python nidoviruses belong to the same subfamily as the mentioned

58

human viruses and show similar characteristics (rapid spread, respiratory and gastrointestinal

59

tropism, etc.). The present study confirms the relevance of natural animal diseases to better

60

understand the complexity of viruses of the order nidovirales.

INTRODUCTION

64

In the past, toroviruses, a subfamily of the order Nidovirales, were mainly known to cause

65

enteric disease in mammals (1–4). Recent studies linked nidovirus infections to respiratory

66

disease in cattle, pythons, and lizards, thus establishing nidoviruses as respiratory pathogens (5–

67

12). In pythons, nidoviruses were found to be associated with chronic proliferative pneumonia

68

(5, 6, 10, 11), and the association was confirmed by experimental infection studies (7). Severe

69

cases exhibit typical pathological changes both after experimental and natural infection; these

70

include stomatitis, rhinitis, tracheitis, and pneumonia with significant mucus accumulation.

71

Taxonomically, python nidoviruses have recently been reclassified into the family

72

Tobaniviridae, subfamily Serpentovirinae, genus Pregotovirus (International Committee on

73

Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), https://talk.ictvonline.org (July 2018)).

74

A recent study identified yet another new novel nidovirus (genus Barnivirus) in Bellinger River

75

snapping turtles (Myuchelys georgesi). The infection was associated with necrotizing cystitis,

76

nephritis, adenitis and vasculitis, and the presence of viral RNA in many tissues, indicating

77

systemic spread of the virus (12). The target cell spectrum of python nidoviruses includes the

78

epithelium of the respiratory tract and lungs (6), and in some cases also the oral cavity and the

79

cranial esophagus (5–7, 11), the mucosa of which exhibits ciliated epithelium in snakes (13).

80

Thus far little is known about the intra- and interspecies transmission of python nidoviruses.

81

However, recent studies demonstrated nidovirus RNA in oral and cloacal swabs and the

82

intestinal content of diseased and healthy snakes, suggesting that both airborne and fecal-oral

83

transmission may occur (7, 14, 9–11).

84

In an earlier report, we studied the pathogenesis of nidovirus-associated pneumonia in green tree

85

pythons (6). Similarly to other investigators who described nidovirus pneumonia in pythons (5,

86

8, 10, 11), we occasionally detected the virus also in other organs, with and without evidence of

87

pathological changes (6), suggesting that the cell tropism of python nidoviruses goes beyond the

88

respiratory epithelium. These findings and the fact that nidovirus infections affect several python

89

species led us to the hypothesis that python nidoviruses are not restricted to a certain species and

90

have a broad disease potential. Therefore, we undertook a larger study, making use of diagnostic

91

cases with natural nidovirus infection. A total of 30 nidovirus infected snakes, selected based on

92

demonstration of nidovirus nucleoprotein (NP) by immunohistology in tissues with lesions. Six

93

python species from nine breeding colonies and collections were included, namenly the green

94

tree python (Morelia viridis), woma python (Aspidites ramsayi), carpet python (Morelia spilota),

95

Angolan python (Python anchietae), ball python (Python regius), Indian python (Python

96

molurus), and the black-headed python (Aspidites melanocephalus). Immunohistology also

97

helped to identify the nidovirus target cells (6), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) served to

98

obtain complete or near complete genomes of the causative viruses. The results support the

99

hypothesis that nidovirus infections can cause variable disease in pythons, with lesions in a broad

100
101

spectrum of tissues and organs, and monocyte-mediated systemic spread of the virus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

103

Animals. The study included 30 pythons of six different species (green tree python, Morelia

reaction (RT-PCR) (6) (Table 1). The animals had been submitted for a diagnostic post mortem

109

examination upon the owners’ request, either at the Institute of Veterinary Pathology, Vetsuisse

110

Faculty, University of Zurich, or at the Pathology Unit, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,

111

Spain, between 2012 and 2018. Most animals had died or been euthanized prior to submission;

112

four individuals (CH-A4, CH-B1, CH-B2, E-B2) were submitted by the owner for euthanasia

113

and immediate diagnostic examination. Euthanasia followed an ASPA (Animals Scientific

116

permit was not required for the diagnosis-motivated necropsies and subsequent sample

117

collection.

118

Most animals had presented clinically with respiratory signs, ranging from mild mucus secretion

119

from the oral and nasal cavity to severe acute, recurrent or chronic dyspnea. In some cases, the

120

breeders reported repeated treatment attempts, occasionally for more than one year, prior to the

121

animals’ death, which included frequent nebulising with an antiseptic solution (F10 Antiseptic

122

123

Ltd) and/or antibiotic treatment with commercial broad-spectrum antibiotics such as

124

Enrofloxacin. In other cases, the animals had died suddenly without prior clinical signs (Table

125

1). Affected snakes had a broad age range (3 months to 10 years; average: 3.65 y). Nineteen

127

genital organs). The animals originated from nine collections/breeding colonies of varying size

128

(from a single snake up to a collection of 50 breeding animals) in Switzerland and Spain (Table

129

1).

130

Sample collection and screening for infectious agents. All animals were subjected to a full

131

post mortem examination and samples from brain, lung, liver and kidney were collected and

132

stored at -80 °C for further analysis. In addition, samples from all major organs and tissues

133

(brain, respiratory tract, liver, kidney, spleen, gastrointestinal tract, reproductive tract, pancreas)

134

were collected and fixed in 4% buffered formalin for histological and immunohistological

135

examinations.

136

The lungs of some snakes were submitted to routine bacteriological examination, and from one

137

animal, a virological examination for common respiratory snake viruses was undertaken (Table

138

1).

139

Histology, immunohistology and immunofluorescence. Formalin-fixed tissue samples were

140

trimmed and routinely paraffin wax embedded. Consecutive sections (4-5 μm) were prepared

141

and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) or subjected to immunohistological and

142

immunofluorescence staining.

143

Sections from all histologically examined organs were subjected to immunohistological staining

144

for nidovirus NP, using a custom made rabbit polyclonal antibody (anti-MVNV NP) and a

145

previously described protocol (6). A formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded cell pellet prepared from

146

nidovirus-infected cell cultures served as positive control. Consecutive sections incubated with

147

the pre-immune serum instead of the specific primary antibody served as negative controls.

148

Sections from one individual (CH-A7) underwent immunofluorescence staining. After

149

deparaffinization, they were incubated with anti-MVNV NP antibody at a 1:500 dilution (in

150

phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) overnight at 4 °C; washed five times with PBS, incubated for 30

151

min at room temperature (RT) with 1:500-diluted (in PBS) Alexa Fluor 594-labeled goat anti-

152

rabbit immunoglobulin secondary antibody (Invitrogen) and then washed four times with PBS.

153

Afterwards, the sections were incubated with an anti-Iba-1 antibody (ab5076, Biotec) at a 1:400

154

dilution (in PBS) overnight at 4 °C, washed five times with PBS, and incubated for 30 min at RT

155

with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-goat immunoglobulin secondary antibody (Invitrogen;

156

1:500 in PBS), followed by a 15 min incubation with DAPI (4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole,

157

Novus Biologicals; 1:10,000 in PBS). Sections were washed twice with distilled water, air dried,

158

and a coverslip placed with FluoreGuard mounting medium (Biosystems, Switzerland). Images

159

were taken at a 400 x magnification with a Nikon Eclipse Ti-U inverted microscope with NIS

160

Advanced Research software.

161

Virus isolation. Cultured brain and liver cells of M. viridis, at passage 8-15, were used for

162

inoculations with tissue samples from selected animals (Table 1) as described (6). At 4-5 days

163

post inoculation, the cell culture supernatants were collected for RT-PCR and next generation

164

sequencing (NGS) library preparation.

165

RT-PCR and NGS. RNA was extracted from lung and/or liver tissue samples of 24 animals,

166

from cotton dry swabs used to sample the choanal and cloacal mucosa of 10 animals, from a lung

167

lavage sample of an adult female ball python (Python regius) from a further Swiss breeder

168

unrelated to any of the others, and from tissue culture supernatants (Table 1) as described (6).

169

Library preparation, data analysis, and genome assembly was done as described (6).

170

To study the frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within samples, the NGS

171

reads were quality filtered using Trimmomatic and the reads with Q-score over 30 were

172

assembled against the consensus sequence of a given sample using the BWA-MEM algorithm

173

(15) followed by removal of potential PCR duplicates using SAMTools version 1.8 (16). The

174

frequency of single nucleotide variants in each sequence position was called using LoFreq

175

version 2 (17) and the genetic diversity between viral sequences derived from tissue and cell

176

culture were compared using SNPGenie software (18).

177

Phylogenetic analysis. The sequences of the representatives of the genus Tobaniviridae were

178

downloaded from the GenBank. The complete genomes of python-associated virus strains were

179

aligned using ClustalW algorithm implemented in the MEGA7 program (19). In addition, the

180

amino acid sequences of ORF1b (RdRp) were aligned with MAFFT version 7.407 using E-INS-i

181

parameters (20). The phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Bayesian Markov chain

182

Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, implemented in Mr. Bayes version 3.2 (21) with two

183

independent runs and four chains per run, the GTR-G-I model of substitution for nucleotides and

184

the WAG model of substitution for amino acids. The analyses were run for 5 million states and

185

sampled every 5,000 steps.

186

Recombination analysis. Recombination events were sought from an alignment containing

187

snake-associated nidoviruses using pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) test (22) implemented in

188

SplitsTree version 4.15.1 (23) and tree order scan method implemented in SSE 1.3 software (24),

189

followed by identification of potentially recombinant sequences and estimation of recombination

190

break points using RDP (25), bootscan (26), maxchi (27), chimaera (28), 3seq (29), geneconv

191

(30) and siscan (31) methods implemented in RDP4 software (32). The potential recombination

192

events detected by at least five out of seven methods were further evaluated by constructing

193

phylogenetic trees using neighbor joining method and maximum composite likelihood

194

substitution model implemented in MEGA7 software (19).

RESULTS

197

Gross presentation of nidovirus-associated disease in pythons.

198

Full post mortem examinations were performed on all cases. Most snakes that had died

199

spontaneously exhibited the typical, previously described respiratory changes, represented by a

200

varying amount of mucoid material in the airways and particularly in the lungs (Fig. 1A). In

201

some animals, the oral cavity, the trachea, the lung and the air sacs were filled with mucoid

202

material and the lung parenchyma appeared thickened (nidovirus-associated proliferative

203

disease; Fig.1A); also, the mucoid material was occasionally mixed with purulent exudate. Two

204

euthanized carpet pythons with clinically reported respiratory distress (CH-B1 and -B2, Table 1)

205

did not exhibit any gross pulmonary changes, but showed mild mucus accumulation in the oral

206

cavity. In others, granulomatous and/or fibrinonecrotic lesions were observed in the oral,

207

esophageal and intestinal mucosa (Figs. 1A, B and 2A, B), in liver (Fig. 3A), spleen, or kidney,

208

the coelomic cavity and the oviduct. There was no evidence of a specific lesion pattern in the

209

different affected python species, the findings for each animal are summarized in Table 1.

210

Python nidoviruses have a broad target cell and lesion spectrum.

211

From all animals, the major organs and tissues as well as gross lesions were examined by

212

histology and immunohistology for nidovirus NP. The examination a revealed broad target cell

213

spectrum and nidovirus-associated cytopathic effect.

214

Oral cavity and respiratory tract. The respiratory tract was found to be affected in all animals

215

(100%), with a variable distribution of viral infection and lesions. In 10 animals (33%), the nasal

216

and oral cavities were affected and exhibited multifocal extensive epithelial necrosis with diffuse

217

subepithelial infiltration of the adjacent, partly hyperplastic respiratory and squamous epithelium

218

by numerous heterophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages. Lesions were

219

occasionally covered with fibrin, degenerated epithelial cells and heterophils (fibrinonecrotic

220

rhinitis and stomatitis; Fig. 1C). Nidovirus NP was abundantly expressed in numerous unaltered

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.036640; this version posted April 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

221

and degenerated oral and nasal epithelial cells (Fig. 1D). In two euthanized carpet pythons (CH-

222

B1 and -B2, Table 1), these were the only pathological changes, suggesting that they represented

223

early (initial) lesions. The latter is further supported by the fact that in one of the two individuals

224

(CH-B1) nidovirus NP was also detected in a few individual respiratory epithelial cells in the

225

trachea, some trabecular pseudostratified lung epithelial cells, and occasional type I pneumocytes

226

lining the faveolar space (Fig. 5A), without evidence of cell damage or inflammation. Two ball

227

pythons with fibrinonecrotic rhinitis and stomatitis (E-B1 and -B3) also exhibited a diffuse

228

chronic tracheitis with subepithelial infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages and

229

occasional heterophils, but no further lesions in the lower respiratory tract.

230

The remaining snakes showed histological evidence of nidovirus-associated proliferative disease

231

with epithelial hyperplasia in the nasal cavity, trachea, and lung, as well as mucus and

232

inflammatory cells filling the faveolar space, consistent with our earlier findings (6). Nidovirus

233

NP expression was seen in the pseudostratified epithelium of the primary trabeculae and in type I

234

and type II pneumocytes of the faveolar space; the extent and distribution varied between

235

animals.

236

Alimentary tract. In addition to the respiratory changes, several individuals (CH-A1 and -A9,

237

CH-B6, CH-D1 and -D2, CH-C4, CH-E; carpet pythons, green tree pythons, ball pythons and a

238

black-headed python) exhibited a severe multifocal fibrinonecrotic esophagitis (Fig. 1E, F) with

239

abundant nidovirus-infected intact and degenerate squamous epithelial cells. The gross intestinal

240

lesions observed in another four cases (CH-A7, and -A8, CH-B6, CH-F1) were indeed nidovirus-

241

induced, since all exhibited a multifocal fibrinonecrotic enteritis with nidovirus NP expression in

242

individual intact and degenerating enterocytes (Fig. 2C, D).

243

Vascular involvement, systemic spread and systemic granulomatous and/or fibrinonecrotizing

244

disease. In all snakes with the above-described intestinal changes (CH-A7 and -A8, CH-B6, CH-

245

F1), the mucosal lesions were found to overlie focal inflammatory processes in the intestinal

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.036640; this version posted April 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

246

wall. These were represented by multifocal (pyo)granulomatous perivascular infiltrates of

247

macrophages and fewer heterophils and lymphocytes which were predominantly seen in the

248

submucosa in close proximity to the gut associated lymphatic tissue (GALT) but occasionally

249

extended into the tunica muscularis (Fig. 2C, E). These lesions contained abundant nidovirus NP

250

in infiltrating macrophages (Fig. 2D, F). Occasional affected vessels also exhibited fibrinoid

251

degeneration of the wall with intramural heterophil infiltration. A multifocal pyogranulomatous

252

vasculitis and perivasculitis of small, medium-sized and large veins and arteries was also seen in

253

the serosa of various organs, e.g. the heart, the lung and the thymus, of four snakes (CH-A7, CH-

254

B6, CH-C3, CH-F1) (Fig. 4 C, D). Here, nidovirus NP was not only detected in macrophages of

255

the infiltrates, but also in endothelial cells, which often appeared to be activated (Fig. 2F), and in

256

mononuclear cells in the vessel lumina (Fig. 2F, 4A). Staining for the monocyte/macrophage

257

marker Iba-1 showed that the mononuclear cells in the vessel lumina were predominantly Iba-1

258

positive, i.e. monocytes (Fig. 4B). The latter finding suggests monocyte-associated viremia, and

259

viral spread via infected monocytes.

260

Interestingly, all animals with the described vascular lesions were green tree pythons (CH-A7,

261

CH-B6, CH-C3, CH-F1) and also exhibited multifocal pyogranulomatous lesions, which

262

consisted of a central area of necrosis, surrounded by virus-laden macrophages (Fig. 4 C, D).

263

Affected organs included the kidneys, thymus, heart and liver, and in one animal (CH-C3) the

264

lung. One green tree python (CH-F1) also exhibited pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic

265

lesions in the oviduct, with nidovirus NP found cell-free in necrotic debris. This was seen

266

together with a fibrinous coelomitis in the caudal coelomic cavity, adjacent to the inflamed

267

oviduct. Pyogranulomatous lesions varied in distribution and extent between individuals, but

268

were always present in more than one organ. There was no evidence of bacteria within the

269

lesions. Animals with pyogranulomatous lesions often showed nidovirus NP in epithelia adjacent

270

to the inflammatory foci (e.g. pancreatic ducts, renal tubules etc.) without any evidence of

271

degeneration or necrosis (Fig. 5B, C).

272

Overall, fibrinonecrotic lesions were observed in five green tree pythons (CH-A1 and -A7, CH-

273

B6, CH-C3, CH-F1) and one carpet python (CH-B1). They were represented by diffuse necrosis

274

and fibrin exudation in parenchymatous organs (spleen, thymus) or on the serosal surface of the

275

coelomic cavity (in close proximity to affected organs) with minimal inflammatory response

276

(Fig. 4E and F). These lesions were often observed in animals with nidovirus-associated

277

perivascular/vascular and/or pyogranulomatous lesions, indicating massive systemic spread of

278

the virus.

279

Infection of epithelial cells and ependyma. As described, nidovirus NP was detected in various

types of epithelial cells, often in close proximity to granulomatous or fibrinonecrotic lesions and

281

without evidence of a cytopathic effect. Affected epithelial cells included type I and type II

282

pneumocytes of the lung, epithelial cells of renal tubules and pancreatic ducts, mesothelial cells

283

(Fig. 5A-C) and hepatocytes (Fig. 3D). In two cases (CH-B6 and –F1) ependymal cells were also

284

found to be infected, without evidence of correlating brain lesions (Fig 5D).

285

Virus isolation and identification

286

Nidovirus isolation was attempted by inoculating primary cell cultures of green tree python fetal

287

liver and brain tissue with lung tissue homogenates of 24 animals that had been confirmed as

288

nidovirus infected by immunohistology and RT-PCR. After inoculation, cytopathic effects were

289

observed in 12/24 samples at about 3-4 days post infection (dpi). Two nidovirus positive lung

290

(CH-A8, CH-F2, Table 1) and three positive liver specimens (CH-A7, –A8 and CH-B6, Table 1),

291

a lung lavage sample, and 16 cell culture supernatants (Table 1) were subjected to NGS. To

292

investigate if the viruses were of the same species, we included samples from both Swiss and

293

Spanish collections. The approach yielded nidovirus sequences from 14 lung culture

294

supernatants. De novo genome assembly from tissue sample after removal of reads matching to

295

the host’s genome produced contigs covering the complete coding sequence (CDS) of a

296

nidovirus novel in Switzerland. The genome organization of the identified nidovirus was

297

identical to those described for Ball python nidovirus (BPNV) and Morelia viridis nidovirus

298

(MVNV). The open reading frame 1b (ORF1b, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) of these

299

viruses had less than 5 % nucleotide and less than 2.4 % amino acid differences with recently

300

described Morelia viridis nidovirus isolates BH128 14-12 and BH171 14-7 and Serpentovirinae

301

sp isolates L3, L4 and H0-1, but more than 13 % nucleotide and 8.5 % amino acid differences to

302

all other nidovirus strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on ORF1b suggested that these virus

303

forms a sister clade to the previously known python-associated nidovirus species; BPNV and

304

MVNV (Fig 6). CDSs of the same virus species were obtained from 11 cell culture supernatants,

305

including the isolation attempts from the liver samples included in the NGS analysis. One of the

306

cell culture supernatants analyzed by NGS yielded CDS of MVNV (animal E-C1, Table 1), and

307

for four cell culture supernatants NGS failed due to severe bacterial contamination.

308

For three snakes (CH-A7-8, CH-C3, Table 1) the analysis included cell culture isolated virus

309

(lung homogenate as inoculum) and virus sequenced directly from tissue (liver). The consensus

310

sequences obtained from liver tissue and the respective cell culture isolate were identical for

311

each of these three snakes indicating that isolation did not induce a marked bias in the sequence

312

analysis. Single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis of the NGS data did not show evidence of

313

significant differences in the sequences obtained from different organs or from cell culture

314

isolates. Likewise, the SNV analysis did not either find differences between the viral populations

315

obtained from animals with or without systemic infection, suggesting that viral intra-host

316

polymorphism does not explain the varying pathogenic manifestation.

317

Recombination

318

The initial NeighborNet analysis of snake-associated nidoviruses suggested strong evidence of

319

recombination (PHI test p<0.001) (Fig 7A). Similarly, the tree order scan suggested a high

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.036640; this version posted April 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

320

amount of phylogeny violations across the genome. Therefore, we conducted a more detailed

321

recombination analysis. This analysis suggested at least five highly supported recombination

322

events.

323

Morelia viridis nidovirus isolates BH171/14-7 and BH128/14-12 (33) cluster together with

324

Serpentovirinae sp. isolate L1 based on 5’ and 3’ ends of the genome (corresponding to

325

nucleotides 1-14704 and 36100-37869 in the alignment), whereas based on nucleotides 14705-

326

25143 and 27808-36099 these strains cluster together with Serpentovirinae sp. isolate H0-1

327

(MN161564), and between nucleotides 25144 and 27807 together with strain CH-F1

328

(MK722373) (Fig 7B). Likewise, strain CH-F1 clusters together with Serpentovirinae sp. isolate

329

L1

330

MK722375_Python_regius based on the 3’ end of the genome (Fig 7C). This suggests that the

331

Serpentovirinae sp. isolate L1 (MN161567) has been involved in at least two distinct

332

recombination events. Although these four isolates (Serpentovirinae sp. isolate L1, Morelia

333

viridis nidovirus isolates BH171/14-7 and BH128/14-12 and strain CH-F1) cluster together in

334

the 5’end of the genome, the genetic distances between these strains are rather high in this

335

region, suggesting that the exact recombination partners are not represented in the dataset. Since

336

Serpentovirinae sp. isolate L1 was sequenced from a Python regius in the USA in 2015 (14),

337

whereas the strains BH171/14-7, BH128/14-12 (33) and CH-F1 were isolated from a Morelia

338

viridis in Germany (2015) and Switzerland (2018), it is likely that the recombination events have

339

occurred between the ancestors of these lineages.

340

Another clear recombination event was detected in the strain CH-A8 (MK722376), which

341

clusters together with the strains CH-A7 and CH-C3 based on the majority of the genome,

342

whereas between nucleotides 25205-37482 it clusters with CH-A5 (MK722363) (Fig 7D). In

343

addition, the strain CH-D2 clusters together with this group (CH-A8 / CH-A5) based on

344

nucleotides 25205-37482.

345

Sequential exclusion of recombinant regions from the alignment (i.e. nucleotides 1-14704 and

346

25144-37869) resulted in the tree shown in Figure 7E. Although some of the methods included

347

in RDP4 analysis still found evidence of recombination in this alignment, the further removal of

348

these regions did not affect the topology of the tree.

349

The phylogenetic tree indicated that multiple viral strains circulate among the snakes of a single

350

breeder and, on the other hand, there are some indications of viral transmission between the

351

breeders, as exemplified by the high similarity of strains CH-B1, CH-B3 (breeder CH-B) and

352

CH-E2 (breeder CH-E).

353

The breeders CH-A, CH-B, CH-C and CH-F exchanged animals, which may explain the

354

grouping of strains CH-C3, CH-A7, CH-E2, CH-B1, CH-B3, CH-B5 and CH-A8 to a single

355

cluster. Notably, no recombination events were detected between the newly detected nidovirus

356

species and the previously characterized Morelia viridis nidovirus, python nidovirus and ball

357

python nidovirus (Fig 7E), suggesting that recombination occurs only within virus species but

358

not between species.

359

Evidence of horizontal transmission within colonies and of virus shedding from diseased

360

animals

361

One Swiss breeder (CH-B, Table 1) lost one of three juvenile carpet pythons from the same

362

clutch that had been housed separate from each other, but in the same room (distance less than

363

0.5 m), to severe fatal proliferative pneumonia (CH-B4). The post mortem examination

364

confirmed nidovirus-associated pneumonia in the deceased animal, prompting the breeder to

365

submit the two siblings (CH-B1 and -B2, Table 1) for euthanasia and diagnostic post mortem

366

examination. Both individuals exhibited nidovirus-associated lesions in the upper airways but

367

not in the lung, suggesting that these cases represented an early disease stage following airborne

368

infection.

369

In addition to the above snakes, we studied choanal and/or cloacal swabs from seven additional

370

animals from different collections for the presence of nidovirus RNA by RT-PCR. All of the

371

tested animals were found positive for nidovirus infection (Table 1), and included individuals

372

with nidovirus-associated proliferative disease (respiratory form) and individuals with evidence

373

of granulomatous and fibrinonecrotic disease (systemic form), suggesting that diseased animals

374

shed the virus. Further, the virus strains from snakes CH-B1, CH-B3 and CH-B5 showed high

375

genetic identities and clustered together in the phylogenetic trees suggesting viral transmission

376

between the snakes of breeder CH-B.

377

Pathological changes unrelated to nidovirus infection

378

Individual snakes exhibited additional lesions that appeared to be unrelated to nidovirus

379

infection, as confirmed by immunohistology for nidovirus NP; renal gout (CH-A3 and E-A1,

380

Table 1), and a necrotzing splenitis (CH-A1 and CH-C4, Table 1) and fibrinonecrotic enteritis

381

with intralesional coccoid bacterial colonies (E-B1, Table 1). Both conditions are likely a

382

consequence of debilation/dehydration due to chronic pulmonary disease.

DISCUSSION

385

Nidoviruses have recently been described as the cause of respiratory tract disease in several

386

python species in the USA and Europe (5, 6, 10, 11), representing an emerging threat to python

387

traders and breeders in particular. The present study aimed to further elucidate the characteristics

388

and relevance of python nidoviruses. Particular emphasis was laid on the potential species

389

specificity of and/or susceptibility to the viruses, their phylogeny and geographic divergence as

390

well as viral shedding and transmission, host cell tropism and type of associated disease.

391

Experimental infection has been shown to reproduce the naturally occurring respiratory disease

392

(7), so our study focused on natural cases from different geographic regions, from breeding

393

colonies that often kept several python species, and from colonies that at least partly worked

394

closely together, exchanging animals.

395

Pythons are nonvenomous snakes found in Africa, Asia and Australia. Eight genera and 31

396

species are currently recognized, most are also kept in captivity (34). The present study shows

397

that python species originating from three continents are susceptible to python nidoviruses and

398

can develop nidovirus-associated disease. Ball pythons (Python regius (35)) and Angolan

399

pythons (Python anchietae (36)) are closely related and originate from sub-Saharan and southern

400

Africa, respectively. The green tree python (Morelia viridis (Schlegel, 1872)), the carpet python

401

(Morelia spilota (37)) and the Ramsay’s python (Aspidites ramsayi, (38)) represent species

402

originating from Australia and New Guinea (Indonesia and Papua New Guinea), whereas the

403

Indian python (Python molurus (39)) is indigenous to the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast

404

Asia.

405

In our study, no differences were noted between the python species in the degree and distribution

406

of nidovirus-associated respiratory disease. However, it is interesting to note that all animals

407

with systemic viral spread (indicated by disseminated granulomatous and/or fibrinonecrotic

408

lesions, [peri]vascular lesions, infected monocytes etc.) were of the genus Morelia. The results

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.036640; this version posted April 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

409

suggest increased susceptibility of snakes from this genus to nidovirus infection and/or disease, a

410

finding also supported by recent epidemiologic studies (14). In support, the analysis of the viral

411

genomes by NGS did not show differences in the viral genome that would explain the

412

differences in the disease manifestation. One could speculate that each python species has its

413

own nidovirus, and that cross-species transmission of the viruses results in morbidity. Should

414

pythons (or snakes in general) indeed be hosts for nidoviruses, then a co-infection with an

415

unidentified bacterial or viral agent could also explain the sudden emergence of fatal pneumonia

416

cases in captive snakes. An alternative explanation for the emergence of nidovirus infections in

417

python collections could be that there have been multiple nidovirus introductions to various

418

python species from an unknown host species or a vector.

419

Recently, experimental infection of ball pythons established the causal relationship between

420

nidovirus infection and mucinous inflammation of the upper respiratory and the gastrointestinal

421

tract as the main pathological process early, i.e. within the first 12 weeks, after infection (7).

422

Infected pythons showed severe respiratory distress with only minimal pneumonia, most likely

423

because the mucus overproduction resulted in obstruction of the upper airways (7). These

424

findings correlate with those we made when studying naturally infected cases; some animals

425

were submitted for euthanasia due to acute respiratory distress, but only exhibited inflammatory

426

processes in nasal and oral cavity, without histologic evidence of tracheitis or pneumonia. In all

427

other naturally infected animals, rhinitis, stomatitis and tracheitis were present, as well as a

428

variable degree of proliferative pneumonia, indicating longer duration and a more progressed

429

stage of the disease. On that note, the anatomic structure of the snake lung has to be considered,

430

as studies on Burmese pythons have shown that python lungs provide excess capacity for oxygen

431

exchange. This leads to progressive spread of respiratory infections through the lung, thereby

432

continuously reducing respiratory gas exchange without causing clinical signs. The latter will

433

develop only when the oxygen exchange capacity falls below the requirements of the metabolic

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.036640; this version posted April 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

434

rate. This is particularly relevant in association with hyperplasia of the pulmonary epithelium,

435

which has an impact on the blood gas exchange (40). In some snakes, we additionally observed

436

an esophagitis; this is interpreted as a consequence of overspill and swallowing of virus-laden

437

mucus, a theory also supported by previous studies (6, 7, 40). It is possible that the esophagus is

438

involved because its epithelium contains ciliated cells in various snake species (13), and ciliated

439

cells represent the primary site of viral replication, a feature also shown for human coronaviruses

440

(13, 41, 42).

441

Similar to python nidoviruses, mammalian toroviruses (found in horses, swine and cattle) belong

442

to the family Tobaniviridae and have a worldwide distribution (43). Epidemiologic studies are

443

sparse, yet seroprevalence seems to be high in affected populations. For example, the

444

seroprevalence to porcine torovirus (PToV) exceeds 95 % in swine populations, and is 94 % in

445

cattle (Breda virus) (44) and 38% in horses (Berne virus) (45). Neutralizing antibodies to Berne

446

virus (equine torovirus) have also been detected in goats, pigs, rabbits, and some species of wild

447

mice. Equine and porcine toroviruses are generally associated with asymptomatic enteric

448

infections, and transmission is probably via the oral/nasal route through contact with feces (46)

449

or nasopharyngeal secretions (47). However, torovirus infection has been associated with

450

neonatal and postweaning diarrhea in swine (48) and severe diarrheal disease in cattle (49).

451

In our study nidovirus RNA was detected in choanal and cloacal swabs of individuals presenting

452

with either the respiratory (local) or systemic form of the disease. This correlates with studies on

453

human SARS-CoV-2, where viral RNA was detected not only in throat swabs but also in stool

454

samples (50). Viral shedding via the feces in pythons without intestinal lesions could likely be a

455

consequence of the swallowing of mucus. Therefore, besides the respiratory (aerosol) route, the

456

fecal-oral route also appears to be a likely way of transmission in pythons. The literature

457

suggests that mammalian coronaviruses have a limited host cell tropism and affect either the

458

intestinal or the alveolar epithelium (6, 7, 10, 11, 47, 51–53). This seems not to apply to python

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.036640; this version posted April 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

459

nidoviruses for which the results of the present study indicate a rather broad cell tropism, for

460

various types of epithelia (respiratory and pulmonary epithelium, enterocytes, hepatocytes,

461

epithelial cells in renal tubules and pancreatic ducts) and ependymal cells. Interestingly, a similar

462

tendency is described for SARS-CoV-2 (54). Previous studies on python nidoviruses have hinted

463

at a broader target cell spectrum, but did so far not go beyond the detection of nidovirus RNA in

464

organs other than the respiratory tract (10), and did neither identify infected cells nor correlate

465

infection with actual organ lesions.

466

Of particular interest is the fact that python nidoviruses also infect non-epithelial cells distributed

467

over the entire body. We detected nidovirus NP in endothelial cells, intravascular monocytes and

468

extravascular macrophages within inflammatory processes. The latter suggest that monocytes

469

facilitate the systemic spread of the virus. So far, viruses of the subfamily Tobaniviridae have

470

not been reported to infect monocytes/macrophages. However, monocyte/macrophage infection

471

is known to be a key process in the pathogenesis of other members of the order Nidovirales, such

472

as feline coronaviruses (FCoV) (55), ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV) (56) and Severe

473

Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (57). For FCoV, the ability to infect,

474

replicate in and activate monocytes and macrophages is essential in the pathogenesis of feline

475

infectious peritonitis (FIP), a fatal disease of felids. While the low-virulence feline enteric

476

coronavirus (FECV) biotype primarily replicates in enterocytes and does only induce mild

477

enteric disease, the highly virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) biotype

478

predominantly arises after S gene mutations in FECV of the infected host that allow efficient

479

replication in and systemic spread with monocytes (58). This allows rapid dissemination of the

480

virus throughout the body (monocyte-associated viremia) and is a prerequisite of the monocyte

481

activation with subsequent development of the granulomatous phlebitis that is the hallmark of

482

FIP (55, 59, 60). A similar mechanism is likely for ferrets with a comparable disease and for

483

experimental infections of IFN-γ knock-out mice with Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) (56, 61).

484

Similar to cats with FIP, systemically nidovirus-infected pythons exhibited a multifocal

485

macrophage-dominated vasculitis which was in severe cases associated with fibrinoid necrosis of

486

the vessel wall, but also appeared as chronic perivascular (pyo)granulomatous cuffs with

487

abundant nidovirus-positive macrophages. These vascular lesions could result from an

488

interaction between activated nidovirus-infected monocytes and endothelial cells, in particular

489

since the latter were also found to become infected. They might also be responsible for the broad

490

spectrum of granulomatous to fibrinonecrotic lesions in organs, since these might at least partly

491

be of ischemic nature.

492

Sequencing of the nidovirus genomes did not reveal variants that would be associated with the

493

systemic infection observed in some individuals. The genome length and relatively high

494

mutation and recombination rate of nidoviruses makes identification of mutations that might

495

alter the pathogenesis of the virus rather challenging. The S protein is the precursor of the spike

496

complex that mediates receptor binding and entry, and thus mutations in the S protein could most

497

easily explain the differences in tissue tropism (62). However, we did not identify S protein

498

mutations that would explain the different phenotypes. One could thus speculate that the

499

different infection outcome is a consequence of differences in the host immune response.

500

During viral infections of mammals, viruses are recognized by pattern recognition receptors

501

(PRRs) which induce a type I interferon (IFN) response, mediated by IFN-α and -β. The IFN

502

response is considered the primary host defense mechanism against viral infections. It is

503

therefore not surprising that many viruses have developed mechanisms to subvert or alter the

504

type I IFN response (61). Interference of nidoviruses with the IFN response has so far mainly

505

been investigated in the family Coronaviridae. In studies on human SARS-CoV infection the

506

presence of viral proteins in monocytes was not found to be associated with significant IFN-α

507

production and it was suggested that viral particles had been taken up by monocytes via

508

phagocytosis. This correlates with studies on IFN receptor deficient knock-out mice where MHV

509

infection was associated with higher viral titers and a broader tissue tropism of the virus (61).

510

Further studies are needed to determine whether systemic nidoviral infection in snakes is also

511

related to an altered interferon response.

Viral target cells – viral antigen expression in cells (detected by immunohistology) with or without evidence of cytopathic effect.
Virus detection – In all animals, nidovirus-associated disease was confirmed by immunohistology, confirming the presence of virus within the lesions. In addition, RT-PCR for
nidovirus (PCR) was performed on tissue samples and/or cloacal (Cl) and choanal (Ch) swabs (Dervas et al., 2017), or next-generation sequencing (NGS) was

Anatomical structures and cell types:
OC - oral cavity; NC - nasal cavity; T – trachea; L - lung; He – heart; Es – esophagus; S – stomach; SI - small intestine; LI - Large intestine; K – kidney; Th – thymus; Sp – spleen;
Ov – oviduct; M – mesothelium; PD - pancreatic ducts; RT - renal tubules
EP - epithelial cells; PD - pancreatic duct epiths VE - vascular endothelial cells; Hep – hepatocytes
Lesions:
NPD - nidovirus-associated proliferative disease (with variable degree of epithelial hyperplasia and inflammation)
FNI: Fibrinonecrotizing inflammation
SGD: Systemic granulomatous disease
V - vasculitis and perivasculitis

¹Routine bacteriological examination was performed on lung samples, with the following results: CH-A1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus sp., Citrobacter
braakii; ; CH-B5, negative; CH-C2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Providencia rettgeri
²Routine virological examination for adenovirus, arenavirus, paramyxovirus, ferlavirus and reovirus was performed in a commercial laboratory on a lung
sample, with negative results.
