Abstract
Severe COVID-19 has been associated with T cell lymphopenia 1,2, but no causal effect of T
cell deficiency on disease severity has been established. To investigate the specific role of T
cells in recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infections we studied rhesus macaques that were
depleted of either CD4+, CD8+ or both T cell subsets prior to infection. Peak virus loads
were similar in all groups, but the resolution of virus in the T cell-depleted animals was
slightly delayed compared to controls. The T cell-depleted groups developed virusneutralizing antibody responses and also class-switched to IgG. When re-infected six
weeks later, the T cell-depleted animals showed anamnestic immune responses
characterized by rapid induction of high-titer virus-neutralizing antibodies, faster control
of virus loads and reduced clinical signs. These results indicate that while T cells play a
role in the recovery of rhesus macaques from acute SARS-CoV-2 infections, their depletion
does not induce severe disease, and T cells do not account for the natural resistance of
rhesus macaques to severe COVID-19. Neither primed CD4+ or CD8+ T cells appeared
critical for immunoglobulin class switching, the development of immunological memory or
protection from a second infection.

Introduction

2

Several lines of evidence suggest that T cells play important roles in COVID-191. For example,

3

it has been shown that COVID-19 convalescent patients possess both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells

4

responsive to SARS-CoV-2 antigens3. Furthermore, severe COVID-19 is associated with

5

lymphopenia including loss of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells4-6. However, it is not known whether

6

lymphopenia contributes to severe COVID-19 or is an effect of the disease. Thus, definitive

7

proof of the importance of T cells in recovery from infection and the development of anamnestic

8

responses remains an open question. As an experimental approach to answer this question, we

9

studied adult rhesus macaques that had been depleted of either CD4+, CD8+ or both T cell

10

subsets prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1a). Similar to most adult humans, rhesus

11

macaques become only mildly or moderately affected following infection with SARS-CoV-2,

12

and they do not normally develop acute respiratory distress syndrome7,8. Understanding the

13

immunological mechanisms that participate in the resistance of these animals to severe disease is

14

of great interest because it could lead to the rational design of improved vaccines, prophylactics

15

and therapeutics. In this study we focus on the role of T cells in the resolution of acute SARS-

16

CoV-2 infection, and in the development of immunological memory, which provides better

17

protection upon re-infection. It has been shown that rhesus macaques are protected from re-

18

infection9,10, but the role of T cells and particularly CD4+ T cells in that protection is not yet fully

19

understood11.

Results.

22

All macaques were inoculated with the Washington isolate of SARS-CoV-2 as previously

23

described7 and then rested for six weeks. The animals were then challenged a second time as

24

previously. Two separate experiments were carried out, each with three animals per group for a

25

total of six macaques per group. All results from individual animals are labeled with the same

26

symbol throughout: black symbols for animals in the first experiment and orange for those in the

27

second. Findings from the re-infection are highlighted in yellow throughout.

28

Lymphocyte responses in normal control animals. Most of the non-depleted control animals

29

showed a rapid but transient lymphopenia with loss of CD4+ T helper cells, CD8+ T cells and

30

also B cells from the blood, possibly due to homing to lymphoid tissues. CD4+ T numbers

31

rebounded to approximately equivalent or higher levels by 7 dpi (Fig. 1b) and CD8+ T cell

32

counts were significantly higher at 7 dpi than at day 0 (Fig. 1c) suggesting mobilization or a

33

proliferative response to infection. In support of a proliferative response there was a significant

34

increase in Ki-67 expression at 7 dpi (Supplementary data Fig. 1a). Similar responses were

35

observed following re-infection (yellow shading). B cell numbers in the blood also decreased

36

rapidly after infection and then rebounded over the next several weeks (Fig. 1d).

37

Lymphocyte responses in CD4-depleted animals. At day 0 the CD4+ T cell depletion in the

38

blood was greater than 90% in all but one animal (#CD4-5 was 78% depleted) (Fig. 1e). No

39

significant increases in numbers were observed in the six subsequent weeks suggesting that little

40

or no immunological priming occurred. Most animals showed slight increases in CD4+ T cell

41

counts following re-infection, but it is not known if this was a response to infection or simply

42

reconstitution following depletion (Fig. 1e, yellow shading). The CD8+ T cell responses to

43

infection were quite similar to the controls (Fig. 1f) but there was no B cell response apparent in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.02.438262; this version posted April 4, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

44

the blood except for a minimal response by animal #CD4-5 following re-infection (Fig. 1f). The

45

reduction of B cell numbers in the CD4-depleted groups compared to the controls over time was

46

statistically significant (p = 0.0118). Thus, depletion of CD4+ T cells produced only a minimal

47

impact on CD8+ T cell responses but had a significant negative impact on B cell responses.

48

Lymphocyte responses in CD8-depleted animals. The expansion of CD4+ T helpers in the

49

blood following infection in the CD8-depleted animals was similar or slightly stronger than the

50

controls, although one animal (#CD8-4) failed to respond (Fig. 1h). The CD4+ T responses to

51

the second infection also appeared slightly stronger than the controls, possibly a compensatory

52

response to the lack of CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1h). The CD8+ T cell depletions were >99% effective

53

in all animals and there was no detectable CD8+ T cell expansion in the blood for the first two

54

weeks after infection suggesting that minimal or no immunological priming had occurred (Fig.

55

1i). There was a slight rebound of CD8+ T cells in most animals by the day of re-infection but

56

little expansion in the following two weeks. Thus, there was no indication of a significant CD8+

57

T cell response to either the first or second infection. All but one animal (CD8-4) had B cell

58

expansions as good or better than the controls (Fig. 1j). The non-responding animal started off

59

the experiment with the lowest CD4+ T cell count (Fig. 1h), consistent with the finding that

60

CD4+ T cells were important for B cell expansion.

61

Lymphocyte responses in CD4/8 dually-depleted animals. The simultaneous depletions of

62

both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were less effective for CD4+ T cells than the single subset

63

depletions and ranged between 56% and 98% at the time of infection (Fig. 1k). The most

64

strongly depleted animal (#CD4/8-1) displayed little CD4+ T cell responsiveness to either the

65

first or second infection. The other five animals showed delayed CD4+ T cell responses

66

compared to controls, but increased numbers appeared in the 2 to 4 weeks following infection.

67

Four of the animals showed rapid CD4+ T cell expansion following re-infection indicating that

68

the cells had been primed (Fig. 1k). The CD8 depletions were greater than 99% effective at 7 dpi

69

(Fig. 1l) and both the CD8+ T cell responses and B cell responses (Fig. 1m) were very similar to

70

those in the CD8-depleted group. The one animal that failed to make a B cell response was once

71

again the one with the lowest CD4+ T cell numbers (#CD4/8-1).

72

Virus loads. As previously described for SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques 7,9, all animals had

73

high loads of viral RNA in nasal swabs indicative of upper respiratory tract infection. The titers

74

of individual animals in each group are shown in Fig. 2a-d. The RNA loads during the first two

75

weeks of infection were not significantly different between groups, but all control animals

76

cleared infections by 14 days, while the T cell-depleted groups did not totally clear until day 21

77

or later. The dually depleted animals cleared total viral RNA significantly slower than the

78

controls animals (p = 0.0362, Fig. 2d). In all T cell-depleted groups the second infection was

79

handled better than the first as evidenced by lower viral RNA loads and quicker resolution (Fig.

80

2a-d, yellow shading). To minimize detection of residual inoculum, nasal swabs were also tested

81

for viral E gene subgenomic mRNA (sgRNA) indicative of replicating virus 9. The mean loads

82

of sgRNA (in blue) were lower than the mean loads of total viral RNA but followed similar

83

curves (Fig. 2e-h). Again, all control animals became undetectable for sgRNA at 7 dpi while all

84

T cell-depleted groups still had positive animals. This delay in virus clearance indicated the

85

involvement of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the rapid resolution of acute infection. However, T

86

cells were not essential for eventual clearance. Viral replication in the lower respiratory tract was

87

assayed by analysis of sgRNA in bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) at 1 dpi and at 1 day post-re-

88

infection (dpri). At 1 dpi, all but one control animal had high viral RNA loads with no

89

significant differences between groups (Fig. 2i-l). Upon re-infection, the lungs showed

90

significantly reduced viral RNA at 1 dpri (d43) compared to 1 dpi, but most animals in all groups

91

had detectable sgRNA in BAL following re-infection. No significant differences between

92

groups were observed at either time point. One or two animals in each group had detectable viral

93

RNA in rectal swabs but no animals had detectable viral RNA in the blood (data not shown). The

94

improved control of virus in the upper and lower respiratory tracts upon re-infection indicated

95

the presence of anamnestic immune responses, and the similarity of all groups in controlling the

96

second infection indicated that such responses were not dependent on an intact T cell repertoire.

97

We next analyzed clinical signs to determine if the reduced viral loads following re-infection

98

were associated with reduced disease.

99

Clinical signs. On exam days, each animal was scored in a blinded manner for clinical signs and

100

pulmonary radiographs were performed. The most common clinical signs were reduced appetite,

101

slightly irregular abdominal breathing, ruffled fur and pale appearance (Supplementary data Fig.

102

3). The cumulative clinical scores for each animal during the first two weeks of infection and re-

103

infection are shown in Fig. 3a-d. All animals developed mild and transient clinical signs during

104

acute infection, and there were no significant differences between the groups. It cannot be

105

excluded that some of the clinical signs were in response to the procedures performed on the

106

animals, which included anesthesia, blood withdrawals, intratracheal virus inoculation and

107

brocho-alveolar lavage. However, upon re-infection the animals underwent the same procedures,

108

and the mean clinical scores in all groups were significantly reduced compared to primary

109

infection (Fig. 3a-d, yellow shading). Pulmonary radiographs showed that all animals developed

110

minor lesions in at least one lobe of the lungs during the first infection (Fig. 3e-h), and the scores

111

were significantly lower after re-infection except in the CD8-depleted group. There were no

112

statistically significant differences in the radiological findings between the control animals and

113

the depleted animals at any time points. We thought it was worth noting that all of the control

114

animals and four of six CD4-depleted animals developed a rapid but transient blood neutrophilia

115

following the first but not the second infection (Fig. 3i). Neutrophilia may result from the stress

116

of handling the animals, but no significant neutrophilia was observed following the first infection

117

in either the CD8-depleted or dually depleted animals (Fig. 3k, l). These findings suggested that

118

neutrophilia was CD8+ T cell-dependent. As a whole, these results indicated that neither CD4+

119

nor CD8+ T cells appeared critical for either recovery from the first infection or improved control

120

of the second infection. Furthermore, there was no evidence that T cell-mediated

121

immunopathology was involved in the disease. The decreased clinical signs following the

122

second infection indicated the induction of an anamnestic immune response that appeared to be

123

largely independent of T cells. Thus, it was of interest to next investigate the antibody

124

responses.

125

Antibody responses. Controls. The development of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain

126

(RBD)-binding antibodies was analyzed in a kinetic manner. The first antibody subtype that

127

develops in response to infections is IgM, and all control animals produced RBD-specific IgM

128

responses peaking at 14 dpi (Fig. 4a). During the antibody maturation process, class switch

129

recombination leads to the development of IgG isotype antibodies in a process usually dependent

130

on CD4+ T cells. As expected, IgG responses also developed, lagging behind the IgM responses

131

by one to two weeks and peaking in most animals at 4 wpi (Fig. 4b). The IgG titers had waned

132

slightly by 6 wpi. Upon re-infection, IgG titers rose quickly and dramatically with a mean 37-

133

fold increase in titer within one week (Fig. 4b). All control animals also developed virus-

134

neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses with similar kinetics as the RBD-specific IgG responses

135

(Fig. 1C). These results demonstrated a strong anamnestic antibody response.

136

CD4-depleted animals. Half of the CD4-depleted animals showed delayed or flat IgM responses

137

(Fig. 4d) and two of them also showed flat IgG responses until re-infection (Fig. 4e). More

138

surprising was that the other four animals developed class-switched IgG responses and all of

139

them developed both virus-neutralizing responses (Fig. 4f) and strong anamnestic responses

140

upon re-infection (Fig. 4e). Of note, one of the animals in the CD4-depleted group (#CD4-2)

141

started the experiment with IgM cross-reactive with RBD (Fig. 4d) as did one of the CD8-

142

depleted animals (#CD8-3). This may have been due to a previous exposure to a different

143

coronavirus. Overall, CD4 depletion delayed and/or dampened IgM and IgG responses in some

144

animals, but all animals developed strong anamnestic IgG responses upon re-infection.

145

CD8 and CD4/8-depleted animals. The IgM, IgG and nAb responses of both the CD8- (Fig. 4

146

g-i) and CD4/8-dually depleted animals (Fig. 4j-l) can be summarized as being very similar to

147

each other and to the controls. No significant effect from CD8-depletions on antibody responses

148

was observed.

149

In summary, there was no major impact of T cell depletions on the antibody responses even

150

though there was no detectable B cell response in the blood of the CD4-depleted animals (Fig.

151

1g). The binding and neutralizing antibody titers waned by 42 dpi but rapidly expanded upon re-

152

challenge regardless of T cell depletions. Thus, the memory B cell response may be more

153

critical for protection from re-challenge than standing high titers of antibody.

154

Cervical lymph node analysis. T cell levels in blood may not reflect levels in tissues where

155

cells may be more refractory to antibody-mediated depletions. No biopsies were taken during the

156

course of the experiment, but immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was used to examine CD4+

157

and CD8+ T cells in necropsy tissues at the termination of the experiment (56 dpi). A

158

representative section from a cervical lymph node (LN), which drains the upper respiratory tract

159

is shown for each experimental group (Fig. 5).

160

CD4+ T cells. Sections of cervical lymph nodes (LN) from controls showed abundant CD4+ T

161

cells in periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths and the mantle zone of lymphoid follicles. Representative

162

low and high-magnification sections are shown in Fig. 5a. In comparison, CD4+ T cells were

163

greatly reduced in the lymphoid follicles from CD4-depleted animals, although not completely

164

gone (Fig. 5b). CD4+ T cell staining appeared normal in the CD8-depleted animals (Fig. 5c), but

165

the CD4/8-depleted animals showed moderately decreased staining (Fig. 5d).

166

Immunohistochemical staining of spleen sections gave results very similar to the cervical lymph

167

nodes (Supplementary data Fig. 5a, b). These findings cannot distinguish between T cells never

168

depleted and re-seeding of the tissues during the course of the experiment.

169

CD8+ T cells. Compared to the control (Fig. 5e), the CD8+ T cell staining in the CD4-depleted

170

animals appeared normal to slightly increased (Fig. 5f). The LNs from both the CD8-depleted

171

and dually depleted animals showed dramatically reduced CD8+ T cell staining (Fig. 5g, h).

172

B cells. The LN were also stained with anti-CD20 to detect B cells. Unlike the diminished levels

173

of B cells in the blood of CD4-depleted animals (Fig. 1g), no difference in total CD20 staining

174

was observed in the LN (Fig. 5i-l).

Discussion.
It has been previously reported that rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 are

178

resistant to severe disease, similar to most young adult humans 7. In this study we investigated

179

the role of CD8+ T cells in the natural resistance of macaques to severe COVID-19. The

180

relevance of the results is highlighted by the fact that T cell lymphopenia and T cell dysfunction

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.02.438262; this version posted April 4, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

181

are associated with severe illness in humans with SARS-CoV-2 infection 1,2,12 5,13. Interestingly,

182

we found that depletion of either CD4+ and CD8+ T cells only slightly prolonged the recovery of

183

macaques from a first infection with SARS-CoV-2 and had little or no impact on recovery from

184

re-infection. This is not to say that T cells do not normally play roles in controlling acute SARS-

185

CoV-2 infections or anamnestic responses, but rather that such roles do not appear critical or that

186

their loss may be compensated by other immune cells in macaques. On the other hand, there was

187

also no evidence that T cells played a pathological role in the development of disease in

188

macaques, as the disease severity in the T cell replete animals was similar to the T cell-depleted

189

animals.

190

It was unexpected that the CD4-depleted animals would class switch to Ig during primary

191

infection and also mount anamnestic IgG responses upon second infection. The SARS-CoV-2

192

virion does not contain classic T cell-independent antigens, which are typically rigid arrays of 30

193

or more repeated epitopes optimally separated by 5-10 nm such as those present on vesicular

194

stomatitis virus 14 15. However, there is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 patients mount

195

extrafollicular B cell responses 16,17, a type of response that has been shown in mouse studies to

196

produce IgM memory B cells and also IgG class-switched memory B cells in a T cell-

197

independent manner 18,19. In that regard most of the mice in all of the groups in this study

198

mounted anamnestic IgM responses (Fig. 4 a, d, g, j), and most also produced inflammatory

199

CXCL-10 (Supplementary Fig. 6), a biomarker associated with severe COVID-19 in humans,

200

and also associated with extrafollicular B cells in COVID-19 patients 17. That said, our analysis

201

did not definitively demonstrate the presence of extrafollicular B cells. We cannot exclude the

202

possibility that despite high level depletions in the blood (Fig. 1d), sufficient CD4+ T cells

203

remained present in lymphoid tissues to generate immunological help. However, the diminished

204

CD4 staining in cervical lymph nodes at 56 dpi (Fig. 5B) and the strongly ablated B cell

205

responses observed in the blood of the CD4-depleted animals compared to controls (Fig. 1g)

206

argue that the CD4 depletions had a major impact on the T cell repertoire of the animals. B cell

207

activation and stimulation of proliferation typically occur in secondary lymphoid organs where

208

they interact with helper T cells20, but the B cells then disperse and appear in the blood at least

209

transiently, as observed in the control animals but not the CD4-depleted animals (Fig. 1d). It is

210

also possible that help for immunoglobulin class switching was provided by compensatory

211

responses from non-CD4+ cells. For example, in the absence of CD4+ T cells, mouse studies

212

with inactivated influenza virus revealed that CD4− CD8− double-negative αβ T cells could

213

provide help for immunoglobulin class switching 21. In addition, interferon gamma-producing γδ

214

T cells have also been shown to enable compensatory immunoglobulin class switching 22.

215

In McMahan et al. 11 rhesus macaques previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 were

216

depleted of CD8+ T cells prior to re-infection, which occurred at 7 weeks after the first infection.

217

In that case all 5 of the depleted animals showed breakthrough virus in nasal swabs whereas only

218

one of the controls did. This finding led to the conclusion that CD8+ T cell depletion abrogated

219

the recovery of convalescent macaques. Our study found a slightly prolonged recovery from the

220

first infection but not from re-infection due to CD8+ T cell depletion. In our experiments, which

221

employed the same Washington virus isolate and depleting antibody, half of the control animals

222

and half of the CD8-depleted animals showed breakthrough virus in nasal swabs following re-

223

infection as measured by sgRNA (Fig. 2). Experimental differences included the timing of the re-

224

challenge and the CD8 depletions, as well as the addition of the ocular route of challenge in our

225

experiments. While we found less effect on reinfection than the McMahan study, the difference

226

between these two small studies is not statistically different. Both our studies indicate a role for

227

CD8+ T cells but a more important role for virus-specific antibodies. It would be of interest in

228

further studies to determine whether T cell immunity in the absence of antibody responses would

229

be sufficient for protection.

230

Old age in humans plays a significant role in susceptibility to severe disease and death

231

from SARS-CoV-2 infections, and it is well known that advanced age is associated with

232

immunosenescence23 and dysregulated inflammatory responses24 that result in increased

233

vulnerability to infectious diseases. Thus, aged individuals are likely to be considerably less able

234

than adult macaques to compensate for immune deficiencies such as SARS-CoV-2-induced

235

lymphopenia. The oldest macaque in our study was 9 years old, which is not considered to be

236

aged. It has been shown that aged macaques develop lower antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2

237

infections25,26, so is possible that different results would have been obtained using aged

238

macaques. That said, our results from adult macaques with profound depletion of either CD4+ or

239

CD8+ T cells leads to the conclusion that neither subset played a critical role in their recovery

240

from acute disease or re-infection. On the other hand, anamnestic antibody responses were

241

strongly associated with recovery from a second infection and reduced disease.

242

The current studies do not address the requirement for T cells in long-term memory and

243

protection from COVID-19, which will require further experiments. We are currently faced with

244

the emergence of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants containing mutations in RBD that allow partial

245

or total escape from monoclonal antibodies and reduce vaccine-induced virus neutralization by

246

antibodies27, 28. Furthermore, vaccines based on the original spike sequence appear less

247

protective against the new variants, particularly the South African B.1.351 variant. It is not

248

known whether emerging variants are also evolving to escape T cell responses, but the current

results suggest that there may be less evolutionary pressure to escape T cell responses than B

cell/antibody responses.

interactions, in a climate-controlled room with a fixed light/dark cycle (12-h light/12-h dark).

297

Commercial monkey chow, treats and fruit were provided twice daily by trained personnel.

298

Water was available ad libitum. Environmental enrichment consisted of a variety of human

299

interaction, manipulanda, commercial toys, videos and music. The Institutional Biosafety

300

Committee (IBC) approved work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 strains under biosafety level 3

301

conditions. Sample inactivation was performed according to IBC-approved standard operating

302

procedures for removal of specimens from high containment.

303

Animals. In the first experiment, 12 adult male rhesus macaques aged 2 1/2 to 5 yrs. were

304

randomly divided into four groups of three. All animals were euthanized and necropsied on day

305

56 (day 14 post re-exposure). The experiment was repeated with a second group of 12 rhesus

306

macaques including 10 females aged 3 to 10 yrs. old and 2 males aged 4 and 5 yrs. old.

307

T cell Depletions. At day -7 (relative to infection) the animals were anesthetized and underwent

308

clinical exams. According to group assignment the macaques received a one-time sq. injection of

309

either 1) (10mg/kg) Rhesus recombinant anti-CD4 depleting antibody (CD4R1), 2) mouse/rhesus

310

CDR-grafted form of the depleting anti-CD8α antibody, M-T807 (each at 10mg/ml prepared in

311

pharmaceutical grade by the NIH Nonhuman Primate Reagent Resource), 3) both CD4R1 and

312

M-T807 or 4) physiological saline. At days -4, 0 and +3 the animals received injections as above

313

except via the i.v. route at 5 mg/kg. as per the provider’s instructions.

314

Virus Challenges. On days 0 and 42 the animals were anesthetized and inoculated with SARS-

315

CoV-2 by four routes as previously described 7: intratracheal (4 ml), intranasal (0.5 ml each

316

nostril), oral (1 ml) and ocular (0.25 ml each eye). Back titrations for the inocula showed titers of

317

3.16x105 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)/ml for the first challenge of the first

318

experiment, 4.3x105 TCID50/ml for the second challenge, 4.4x105 TCID50/ml for the first

challenge of the second experiment and 4.3x105 TCID50/ml for the second challenge of the

320

second experiment. SARS-CoV-2 isolate nCoV-WA1-2020 (MN985325.1)14 (Vero passage 3)

321

was provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and propagated as previously

322

described 7.

323

Clinical Exams and necropsy. Macaques were monitored for clinical signs at least twice daily

324

throughout the experiment using a standardized scoring sheet as previously described 7. On exam

325

days (Fig. 1A), clinical parameters such as bodyweight, body temperature and respiration rate

326

were collected, as well as ventrodorsal and lateral chest radiographs. Chest radiographs were

327

interpreted in a blinded manner by a board-certified clinical veterinarian. The total white blood

328

cell count, lymphocyte, neutrophil, platelet, reticulocyte and red blood cell counts, and

329

hemoglobin and hematocrit values were determined from EDTA-treated blood using an IDEXX

330

ProCyte DX Analyzer (IDEXX Laboratories). Necropsies were performed after euthanasia and

331

gross pathology was scored by a board-certified veterinary pathologist. Histopathological

332

analysis of tissue slides was performed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist blinded to the

333

group assignment of the macaques.

334

Histology and Immunohistochemistry. Tissues were fixed in 10 % Neutral Buffered Formalin

335

with two changes, for a minimum of 7 days according to IBC-approved SOP. Tissues were

336

processed with a Sakura VIP-6 Tissue Tek, on a 12-hour automated schedule, using a graded

337

series of ethanol, xylene, and PureAffin. Embedded tissues were sectioned at 5 μm and dried

338

overnight at 42°C prior to staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Specific staining was detected

339

using SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody (Sino Biological cat#40143-MM05) at a

340

1:1000 dilution, CD4 antibody (abcam cat#ab133616) at a 1:100 dilution, CD8 antibody (Sino

341

Biological cat#10980-T24) at a 1:500 dilution, and CD20 (Thermo Scientific cat#RB-9013) at a

342

1:250 dilution. The tissues were processed for immunohistochemistry using the Discovery Ultra

343

automated stainer (Ventana Medical Systems) with a ChromoMap DAB kit (Roche Tissue

344

Diagnostics cat#760–159).

345

Morphometric analysis. CD4 and CD8 IHC stained sections were scanned with an Aperio

346

ScanScope XT (Aperio Technologies, Inc., Vista, CA) and analyzed using the ImageScope

347

Positive Pixel Count algorithm (version 9.1). The default parameters of the Positive Pixel Count

348

(hue of 0.1 and width of 0.5) detected antigen adequately.

349

Thoracic Radiographs. Ventro-dorsal and right/left lateral radiographs were taken on clinical

350

exam days prior to any other procedures. Radiographs were evaluated and scored for the

351

presence of pulmonary infiltrates by two board-certified clinical veterinarians according to a

352

standard scoring system 29. Briefly, each lung lobe was scored individually based on the

353

following criteria: 0 = normal examination; 1 = mild interstitial pulmonary infiltrates; 2 =

354

moderate interstitial pulmonary infiltrates, perhaps with partial cardiac border effacement and

355

small areas of pulmonary consolidation (alveolar patterns and air bronchograms); and 3 =

356

pulmonary consolidation as the primary lung pathology, seen as a progression from grade 2 lung

357

pathology. Days 0 and 42 radiographs were taken prior to inoculation, and thus serve as a

358

baseline for each animal. As such, scores for all lung lobes on Day 0 were set to “0 = normal

359

examination.” All subsequent radiographs were compared to the Day 0 radiographs, evaluated

360

for changes from baseline and scored based on the criteria noted above. At study completion,

361

thoracic radiograph findings are reported as a single radiograph score for each animal on each

362

exam day. To obtain this score, the scores assigned to each of the six lung lobes are added

363

together and recorded as the radiograph score for each animal on each exam day. Scores

364

therefore range from 0 to 18 for each animal on each exam day.

365

Spike and RBD-binding IgM and IgG. IgM and IgG titers were quantified from serum

366

collected for all animals on Days 0, 7, 14, 28, 42, and 49. Meso Scale Discovery V-PLEX

367

SARS-CoV-2 Panel 1 Kit (Rockville, MD) was used for determining antibody binding for IgG

368

(K15359U) and IgM (K15360U) specific for SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD. Protocols were followed as

369

per manufacture’s recommendations. All diluted samples fell within standard curve ranges. A

370

Meso Scale Discovery® MESO QuickPlex SQ 120 instrument was used for measuring

371

chemiluminescence with Methodical Minds ™ acquisition software. Analysis was performed on

372

the DISCOVERY WORKBENCH® software (version 4.0). Concentrations are relative to

373

internal controls and were reported as arbitrary units/mL (AU/mL). Graphpad Prism 8 was used

374

for preparation of graphs and statistical analysis.

375

Virus-neutralizing antibody assay. Neutralizing antibody titers were determined in plasma

376

samples using a modified lentivirus-based pseudovirion assay 30. Plasmids encoding an Env-

377

defective HIV-1 backbone tagged with the nanoluciferase gene (HIV-1NLΔ Env-NanoLuc) and

378

an expression construct for the SARS-CoV-2 spike lacking 19 amino acids of the cytoplasmic

379

tail encoding the ER retention motif (CMV-SARS-CoV-2 SΔ19) were kind gifts from Dr. Paul

380

Bieniasz (Rockefeller University). Pseudovirions were prepared in HEK293T cells by co-

381

transfecting 60 µg of HIV-1NLΔEnv-NanoLuc and CMV-SARS-CoV-2 SΔ19 at a 3:2 ratio in T-

382

175 flasks using the calcium phosphate method, then were concentrated by ultracentrifugation in

383

a sucrose cushion 31. We utilized A549-ACE2 cells 32 as target cells as these cells attached better

384

to the culture plate compared to 293T-ACE2 cells 30, allowing for extensive washes given that

385

the nanoluciferase reporter yielded high backgrounds. A549-ACE2 cells were cultured in

386

complete media containing F-12 Ham’s Media (Corning), 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta

387

Biologicals) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Corning). For the Nab assay, a

388

previously-determined pseudovirus titer (300,000 to 400,000 relative light units or RLU per

389

well) were co-incubated with serial 5-fold dilutions of plasma (1:5 to 1:15,625) in 100 µl

390

complete media at 37°C for 1 h in 96-well round-bottom plates. In duplicate, 40 µl of the virus-

391

plasma mixture was combined with 160 µl of complete media containing 10,000 A549-ACE2

392

cells. The virus-plasma-cell mixtures were plated in white polystyrene plates (Millipore-Sigma)

393

and cultured at 37°C 5% CO2. After 48 h, the spent media in each well were removed, and the

394

cells were washed four times with 200 µl PBS. After the last wash, 100 µl of PBS was dispensed

395

into each well, and mixed with 100 µl of Nano-Glo luciferase substrate working solution

396

(Promega). RLU values were measured in a VictorX5 luminometer (Perkin Elmer). To compute

397

80% inhibitory concentrations (IC80), the mean RLUs of virus-only wells (n=6) in each plate

398

were set as 100% infection. Duplicate RLUs for each plasma dilution were averaged and

399

normalized against virus-only wells. Best-fit nonlinear regression curves were constructed based

400

on a two-phase decay equation (GraphPad Prism 8), and 80% inhibition values (20% infection)

401

were interpolated. Nab titers were reported as reciprocal plasma dilutions.

402

Nab titers against live virus were also determined for a subset of plasma samples (28 dpi) in

403

A549-ACE2 cells in a 48-well plate format 32. Briefly, 1:20, 1:100 and 1:500 dilutions of plasma

404

were co-incubated at 37°C for 1 h with a nonsaturating dose of the SARS-CoV-2 USA-

405

WA1/2020 strain that would yield ~100,000 copies in the quantitative PCR assay. After 24 h,

406

virus copy numbers were evaluated from culture supernatant using nucleocapsid-specific primers

407

and probes as we previously described32.

408

Virus detection. RNA was extracted from swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage using the QiaAmp

409

Viral RNA kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and as described 7. 5 μl

410

RNA was used in a one-step real-time RT–PCR E assay using the Rotor-Gene probe kit (Qiagen)

according to instructions of the manufacturer. In each run, standard dilutions of counted RNA

412

standards were run in parallel, to calculate copy numbers in the samples. For detection of SARS-

413

CoV-2 mRNA, primers targeting open reading frame 7 (ORF7) were designed as follows:

414

forward primer 5′-TCCCAGGTAACAAACCAACC-3′, reverse primer 5′-

415

GCTCACAAGTAGCGAGTGTTAT-3′, and probe FAM-ZEN-

416

CTTGTAGATCTGTTCTCTAAACGAAC-IBFQ. Five μl RNA was used in a one-step real-time

417

RT–PCR using the Rotor-Gene probe kit (Qiagen) according to instructions of the manufacturer.

418

In each run, standard dilutions of counted RNA standards were run in parallel, to calculate copy

419

numbers in the samples. Detection of viral E gene subgenomic mRNA (sgRNA) was performed

420

using RT-PCR as described 9. The forward primer was 5’-3’

421

CGATCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCTC, the reverse primer was

422

ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA and the probe was

FAM-ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG-ZEN-IBHQ.

424

Flow Cytometry. Immune cell marker analysis was performed on freshly isolated PBMCs

425

following enrichment after a standard Histopaque 1077 (Sigma) centrifugation procedure in 15-

426

mL Leucosep Tubes (Greiner Bio-One) from EDTA blood samples. Briefly, 3 mL of room

427

temperature Histopaque 1077 was added to Leucosep tubes and centrifuged at 1000xg for one

428

minute. Blood was diluted 1:2 in 1X DPBS then transferred into the Leucosep tube and

429

centrifuged at 1000xg for 10 min, RT without the brake. The enriched live PBMC fraction was

430

collected and washed in 1X DPBS and then transferred into plates for staining. Cells were

431

incubated for 30 min with the following cell surface antibodies: BUV661-anti-CD45 (D058-128,

437

Buffer Set (Thermo Fisher) following the company’s recommendation. Cells were incubated for

438

30 min with the following antibodies: PE-anti-Foxp3 (259D, BioLegend 3202080 Lot B293618)

439

and AF700-anti-Ki-67 (B56, BD Biosciences 561277 Lot 9315354). Live lymphocytes were

440

gated using a SSC-A and FSC-A gate, by FSC-H and FSC-A to exclude doublets and then by

441

time to exclude artifacts caused by erratic sample flow. Gating strategies for B cells and CD8+

442

and CD4+ T cells are shown in Supplementary data Figure 4. The multi-parameter data were

443

collected within the BSL-4 using a Cytoflex LX (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed using FlowJo

444

software (version 10.7.1; TreeStar, Inc).

445

Statistical Analyses. All statistics were analyzed using Prism Mac OS version 8.4.3 software.

Figure 1
Figure 1. Experimental design and T cell depletions. a. T cell subset-depleting antibodies
were administered on days -7, 0 and +4 as indicated by the blue arrows. Infections were done on
days 0 and 42 as indicated by red arrows. Blood withdrawals were performed on the days
indicated by the black arrows and flow cytometry was used to determine the lymphocyte subset
numbers over time. The flow cytometry gating strategies are shown in Supplemental data Fig.
1b. Each symbol represents a single animal throughout. All CD4-depleted animals except CD45 were still greater than 90% depleted of CD4+ T cells at 7dpi. CD4-5 was 78% depleted. CD4+
Th numbers excluded FoxP3+ cells. At 7 days post-re-infection (49 dpi) the animals averaged
81% depleted. All CD8-depleted animals were >99% depleted at 7dpi and remained 78%
depleted at 49dpi. The differences between subset numbers at 0 dpi and 7 dpi were calculated
by a two-way paired t test. ns = not significant and other p values are shown. Numbers of B cells
(d, g, j, m) were determined by flow cytometry using CD45 and CD20 as markers. The numbers
of B cells in the CD4-depleted group were significantly lower over time than the controls as
determined by mixed effects analysis (p=0.0118).

Figure 2. Virus detection from nasal swabs and Broncho-alveolar lavages. (a-d) Each
symbol represents the value of viral RNA copies from an individual animal at each time point.
The brackets delineate comparisons of cumulative values between the first two weeks after
infection with the two weeks after re-infection, and numbers indicate the p values from two-way
paired t tests showing significantly reduced virus levels following the second infection (b, c, d)
except in the control group (a), which was marginally non-significant. The cumulative RNA
titers from the CD4- and CD8-depleted groups for the first two weeks after initial infection were
not significantly different than the controls but the CD4/CD8-depleted group had significantly
higher titers (p = 0.0362 by one-way Anova with a Dunnett’s post-test). b In (e-h) mean values
are shown comparing the total viral RNA data from a -d (black lines) with sub-genomic sgRNA
results (blue lines). (i-l) Broncho-alveolar lavage fluids were taken at one day after infection and
re-infection. sgRNA was measured from each animal and showed significantly reduced virus
replication upon second infection (p values from paired t tests shown in figure).

Figure 3. Clinical and radiograph scores and neutrophil counts. (a -d) Clinical signs were
scored in a blinded manner using a clinical score sheet. Cumulative scores for the two weeks
following the first infection were compared with the two weeks following re-infection (yellow
shading) using a two-way paired Student’s t test. The dashed lines indicate means. (e -h)
Radiographs were scored in a blinded manner for the presence of pulmonary infiltrates by two
board-certified clinical veterinarians. Cumulative scores were analyzed as in a-d. The dotted line
indicates the maximum score if all lobes were severely affected. (i – l) Neutrophil counts for
each animal were taken on blood withdrawal days and significant differences were noted only
between days 0 to 3 as shown. ns = not significant, * = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01, *** = p < 0.001.

lentiviral pseudovirus expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 spike as described in the method
section. Values are reciprocal dilutions that produced an 80% reduction in pseudovirus infection
(c, f, i, l). Statistics comparing titers at days 7 dpi and 49 dpi were done using a two-way paired
Student’s t test * = p < 0.05, **** = p < 0.0001. Unlabeled comparisons were not statistically
significant. Analysis of differences between experimental groups was done by one-way Anova
with a Dunnett’s multiple comparisons post-test. The ability of sera from 28dpi to neutralize live
SARS-CoV-2 confirmed results from the pseudovirus neutralization assay (Supplemental data
