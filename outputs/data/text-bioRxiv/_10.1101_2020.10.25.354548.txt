Abstract

12

COVID-19, the clinical syndrome caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has rapidly spread globally causing

13

tens of millions of infections and over a million deaths. The potential animal reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2

14

are currently unknown, however sequence analysis has provided plausible potential candidate species.

15

SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enable its entry into host cells

16

and establish infection. We analyzed the binding surface of ACE2 from several important animal

17

species to begin to understand the parameters for the ACE2 recognition by the SARS-CoV-2 spike

18

protein receptor binding domain (RBD). We employed Shannon entropy analysis to determine the

19

variability of ACE2 across its sequence and particularly in its RBD interacting region, and assessed

20

differences between various species’ ACE2 and human ACE2. As cattle are a known reservoir for

21

coronaviruses with previous human zoonotic transfer, and has a relatively divergent ACE2 sequence,

22

we compared the binding kinetics of bovine and human ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. This revealed a

23

nanomolar binding affinity for bovine ACE2 but an approximate ten-fold reduction of binding compared

24

to human ACE2. Since cows have been experimentally infected by SARS-CoV-2, this lower affinity

25

sets a threshold for sequences with lower homology to human ACE2 to be able to serve as a

26

productive viral receptor for SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

33

COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is a zoonotic disease(1-3) that has thus far

34

resulted in over one million deaths worldwide and over 42 million infections (4). The virus crossed the

35

species boundary, possibly from bats and potentially through an intermediate species, to humans and

36

has spread through the respiratory route across the globe in the past year. SARS-CoV-2 is a member

37

of the betacoronavirus genera, which includes other coronaviruses like SARS-CoV, that caused severe

38

acute respiratory syndrome in a pandemic in 2002-2004 (resulting in approximately 800 deaths in 37

39

countries), and MERS-CoV which caused Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome in 2012 (resulting in

40

over 800 deaths in 27 countries). Both of these viruses originated in other species, SARS-CoV in bats,

41

and MERS-CoV in camels, and crossed the species barrier to humans. Other coronaviruses like

42

HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-O43 are known to cause mild respiratory disease in

43

humans and also crossed the species barrier(5-7). Interestingly, the latter two viruses which cause

44

more clinically mild disease appear to have derived from bovine coronavirus (BCoV)(8-10), which

45

causes respiratory and intestinal disease in cattle (7,11-13). Betacoronaviruses as a group have a

46

wide host range including several agricultural and companion animal species(8). Thus, coronavirus

47

disease in humans appears to largely be through zoonotic transfer and has resulted in enormous

48

worldwide morbidity and mortality as well as significant economic loss.

49

Given that coronaviruses appear to have crossed the species barrier several times in human history

50

with devastating consequences, there is a need to understand the interactions between coronaviruses

51

and their receptors in different animal species. This is particularly important since humans interact with

52

companion animals as well as many agricultural species, often in close quarters where respiratory

53

spread can easily occur. In addition to the impact of spread from species to species on human health,

54

coronaviruses can cause devastating effects to animals resulting in morbidity, mortality, and major

55

economic losses (5,7,11,14). Indeed SARS-CoV-2 has been documented to infect dogs (Canis lupus),

56

cats (Felis catus) (15), and mink (Mustela lutrola) (16) in nature, and ferrets (Mustela putoris) (15),

57

hamsters (Cricetulus griseus) (17) and cows (Bos taurus) (18) have been experimentally infected.

58

Human to tiger transfer occurred at the Bronx Zoo (19,20). A mink farm in the Netherlands was

59

ravaged by SARS-CoV-2 infection and farms in the U.S. and Spain were also recently infected (16,21).

60

Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 is now studied in vivo in hamsters (Cricetulus griseus) and ferrets (Mustela

61

putoris) as animal models to understand viral pathology and evaluate therapeutics. The need to

62

understand animal susceptibility to coronavirus infection is therefore important to public health, the

63

economy, as well as to establish well understood animal models for therapeutic and vaccine

64

development.

65

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes its trimeric spike protein to bind to the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)

66

on target pneumocytes or other host cells (22-28). This interaction occurs with high affinity, and results

67

in viral membrane fusion to the host cell and initiates the infectious process. SARS-CoV-1 also utilizes

68

ACE2 as a receptor, however their spike proteins bind with lower affinity (31 nM KD) than SARS-CoV-2

69

(4.2 nM KD)(23). Crystal structure and electron microscopy analysis of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 has

70

revealed the interacting amino acid residues of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) and the

71

human ACE2 surface(23,25,29,30). With sequences available for many companion and agriculturally

72

important species, the ability to assess potential spike RBD binding is an important first step towards

73

prediction of infection of these alternative hosts. Here we analyze the conservation and diversity of the

74

ACE2 protein in multiple important animal species, with particular emphasis on the region that interacts

75

with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. We confirm that an ACE2 from Bos taurus, which is somewhat divergent

76

from human ACE2 in its binding region, interacts with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD with high affinity,

77

suggesting that multiple mammalian species may be susceptible to infection with this coronavirus.

78
79

Results

80

In order to assess the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to interact with ACE2 of important companion and

81

agricultural species, we assembled the ACE2 sequences of several species (Table 1 and Supplemental

82

Table 1). The human ACE2/RBD cocrystal structure (PDB: 6M17)(27) was utilized to visualize

83

interacting residues between the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and human ACE2 (Figure 1). In ACE2, 8

84

residues on two helices make direct contact with spike RBD and an additional 17 residues are within 5

85

angstroms of the RBD. These 25 residues are color coded in Figure 1 as purple (contact) and cyan

86

(nearby), respectively. We focused our evaluation on these interacting residues in the following

87

analyses.

88

In order to determine the overall differences between ACE2 of different species, we employed protein

89

sequence alignment as well as variability analysis (Supplemental Figures 1 and 2). All vertebrate

90

ACE2 sequences showed significant homology to human ACE2, with cynomologous and rhesus

91

monkeys being 95% and 94% identical to human (Table 1). Other mammals were between 80-87%

92

identical to human. Horseshoe bats, a potential reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 (28,31) was only 81% and

93

76% identical through the entire sequence and interacting residues, respectively. Surprisingly, the

94

percent identity across the entire ACE2 sequence did not fully correlate with percent identity of the

95

interacting residues. For example, cows show lower homology throughout the entire ACE2 sequence

96

at only 79% compared to the other species, but is 84% identical within the identified interacting

97

residues. In contrast, dogs are 83.3% identical across the entire sequence, but only 76% identical in

98

the interacting residues. A similar lower identity in binding site interacting residues is also seen for

99

rabbits (Table 1). The relative contribution of the interacting residues versus residues outside the RBD

100

binding site is currently not known, although it is expected that the interacting residues are far more

101

important to infection relative to the residues outside of the RBD binding site.

102

For variability analysis, the structural importance of protein regions, and even individual amino acid

103

residues, can be compared across multiple species. Such diversity analyses initially identified the

104

complementary determining regions within antibodies as important interacting domains with antigen by

105

Kabat and Wu(32,33), and more recently Shannon entropy evaluation has been employed to identify

106

conserved and diverse domains of multiple proteins through multiple sequence analysis(34,35). First,

107

we aligned the ACE2 sequences and determined their percent identities (Table 1 and Supplemental

108

Table 1). Then, we calculated Shannon entropy (SE) across the ACE2 sequences. Of note, ACE2 is

109

remarkably conserved across its sequence, with few residues exhibiting high variability (Figure 2).

110

Within the interacting residues, 21 of 25 are highly conserved, with SE values below 2. Significantly, no

111

residues had values above 3. The more variable residues are colored red and conserved residues blue

112

in Figure 2. Five residues, N330, G352, D355, R357, and R393, are completely conserved, with SE

113

values of zero (Figure 2 and Supplemental Table 1). Four of these are nearby residues with RBD, with

114

only R357 being a contact residue. The complete conservation of these residues suggests that they

115

play an important role in the protease function or structural integrity of ACE2. Residues with values

116

between 0 and 1 are K353, which is a contact residue, and L45, Y83, T324, which are nearby residues

117

(Supplemental Table 1).

118

D38, Q42, M82, and G354. The most diverse residues, with SE values over 2, are Q24, H34, L79, and

119

Q81. Of these, Q24 and H34 are contact residues, with H34 found in a central location in the ACE2-

120

RBD interface (Figure 1, B), and having by far the highest SE value at 2.88 . Others have analyzed the

121

evolution of ACE2 residues and have found positions 24 and 34 to be undergoing positive evolutionary

122

selection pressure (36), and suggested that these positions could play a role in predicting infectivity by

123

SARS-CoV-2 (36).

124

Since the interacting residues are likely most important for viral interaction with ACE2 on the host cell,

125

we evaluated the residues that differed between the various species’ ACE2 and human ACE2 in this

126

region (Figure 3 and Supplemental Figure 3). As mentioned, horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus)

127

shares only 19/25 interacting residues (76%) with human ACE2, and only 5/8 contact residues.

128

Specifically, D30E, H34T, Y41H, and M82N (contact residues), and T27M, E35K (nearby residues) are

129

mutated in horseshoe bat ACE2 relative to human ACE2 (Figure 3, upper left), suggesting potentially

Amino acids with SE values between 1-2 are K26, T27, D30, K31, E35,

130

lower affinity for spike RBD. Pangolin, a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, has only one

131

contact residue (M82N) and three nearby residues (D38E, L79I, and G354H) altered, and both D38E

132

and L79I are conservative changes (Figure 3, upper right). Felines, which have had documented

133

natural infection (15,20), have only two active site residues mutated (D38E and M82T), and only M82T

134

is a contact residue (Figure 3, middle left). Dogs, which also have been infected naturally, have similar

135

binding site residues as cat but with the notable exception of H34Y (Figure 3, middle), a residue

136

reported to be important in binding. Cow has three interaction site residues mutated, of which M82T is

137

a contact residue, and pig has 5 mutations where Q24L, D30E, H34L, M82T are contact residues

138

(Figure 3 bottom).

139

Cows serve as a reservoir for bovine coronavirus (BCoV) a respiratory infection of cattle that is a

140

betacoronavirus (11,12) distantly related to SARS-CoV-2(7). Of considerable note, two BCoV-related

141

coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, have crossed the species barrier, with OC43 likely from

142

cows to humans to cause “common cold” respiratory disease in humans(37). Whereas BCoV, HCoV-

143

OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 utilize 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans as cellular receptors(38), and SARS-CoV-2

144

utilizes ACE2, cows are a potential important species to evaluate for possible SARS-CoV-2 infection as

145

they are a known coronavirus reservoir and they could theoretically serve as host for SARS-CoV-2 and

146

other coronaviruses like BCoV, which could potentially provide a host for coronavirus recombination,

147

selection, and evolution. From a biochemical standpoint, cows have a somewhat more distantly related

148

ACE2 protein compared to many other vertebrates (78.8% compared to most other species which are

149

over 80%), however their binding site residues are more conserved (84%)(Table 1). Therefore, it would

150

be useful to know whether the lower homology across the entire ACE2 sequence prohibits productive

151

ACE2/RBD interaction. To address this question, we expressed human and bovine ACE2 as antibody

152

Fc fusion proteins and compared their interaction with SARS-CoV-2 by enzyme linked immunosorbent

153

assay (ELISA) and further quantified their binding kinetics by surface plasmon resonance analysis

154

(Figure 4). By ELISA, bovine ACE2 had an approximately ten-fold worse binding EC50 (0.129 nM for

155

human ACE2 compared to 1.299 nM for bovine ACE2)(Figure 4, A). This lower apparent affinity for

156

bovine ACE2 was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance analysis which showed a KD for bovine

157

ACE2 of 36.25 nM versus 7.5 nM for human ACE2 (Figure 4, B and Supplementary Table 1). This

158

dissociation constant difference relates primarily to a faster off-rate for bovine ACE2 compared to

159

human ACE2 (Supplementary Figure 5). Of note, despite this lower KD for bovine ACE2, this affinity is

160

very similar to the KD for human ACE2 for the RBD of SARS-CoV-1. Interestingly, for both human and

161

bovine ACE2, the SPR data fit more consistently with a two-site model for interaction, suggesting that

162

the RBD may be multimerizing to produce avidity effects on the chip surface. A potential second site

163

would have ten-fold lower KD values (Supplemental Figure 5), which interestingly, are more in line with

164

the EC50 values of the ELISA (Figure 4, A). Such interactions would be important to explore to

165

understand the details of interaction between coronavirus spike RBD and ACE2 on the cell surface.

166

These interactions would be important to inhibit by therapeutic agents, for example by monoclonal

167

antibodies targeting the virus. The avidity interaction may decrease the KD (increase the affinity) of

168

bovine ACE2 with spike RBD from 36 nM to 2.5 nM, and 7.5 nM to 0.4 nM for human ACE2, a

169

substantial enhancement of the interaction. Regardless of the mechanisms of interaction, it is clear that

170

bovine ACE2 still has high affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 RBD, albeit with five to ten fold worse binding

171

than human ACE2, but yet can still mediate infection of bovine cells(18).

172
173

Discussion

174

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly across the globe through human populations, but

175

additionally has also infected several animal species. While zoonotic in origin, it is still unclear which

176

species provided the reservoir for transfer to humans. Coronaviruses as a group have a very wide

177

range of host species, and have jumped the species barrier multiple times to humans(39,40). While

178

bats appear to be a host species for coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is

179

possible that an as yet unidentified species serves as the reservoir for this virus. Additionally, it is clear

180

that SARS-CoV-2 can naturally infect other species, such as cats, dogs, and mink. In order to

181

understand the host range of SARS-CoV-2 as well as identify potential reservoirs for the virus it is

182

critically important to understand (i) details about the identity and binding properties between the virus

183

and its host cell receptor and possible co-receptors, (ii) other biological requirements needed for the

184

virus to replicate and transmit, for example host cell enzymes needed for viral processing, replication,

185

and assembly. For SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 appears to be the major receptor required for cell entry, so

186

understanding its interaction with ACE2 from humans as well as other species is important to enable

187

predictive methods for viral host range. Here we analyze ACE2 diversity across several species, and

188

specifically evaluate binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to bovine ACE2, finding key interacting residues to

189

be highly conserved.

190

Several studies have used sequence homology and/or structural modeling to attempt to predict SARS-

191

CoV-2 RBD binding to various species’ ACE2 in order to predict the virus host range(15,36,39-43). In

192

an effort to predict species permissive to infection, Damas et.al. developed a five-tiered scoring scheme

193

based on percent identity of 410 vertebrate species, as well as specific structural features of SARS-

194

CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 interactions with ACE2(36). They also focused on 25 amino acid residues at

195

the RBD binding interface, however their 25 residues differed from ours in that they included S16, N53,
6

196

N90, and N322, with the asparagines included as potential glycosylation sites that may impact RBD

197

binding. However, our approach was agnostic in choosing residues that were either (i) known contact

198

residues with the RBD, or (ii) within 5 angstroms of contact residues. Residues included in our analysis

199

which were not included in Damas et.al. were K26, Q81, and N352. Damas et. al. also note that the

200

host range of SARS-CoV-2 might be quite broad and suggest new species that should be evaluated for

201

animal models of virus infection, which notably include cows, which scored in their “medium” category

202

for predictive binding to RBD. Like our assessment of homology, they find that bats score very low in

203

predicted ACE2 binding. Interestingly, using sequence evolution and selection analysis, they identify

204

Q24 and H34 as positions undergoing positive selection and evolution. We identified these as amongst

205

the most variable residues by Shannon entropy analysis, and these also appear to be important

206

residues at the ACE2/RBD interface. As in our analysis, pangolins scored low in potential RBD binding

207

based on interacting residue homology, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may bind other pangolin

208

receptors, or have other mechanisms to interact with ACE2. As pangolins are thought to be a possible

209

intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2, much more biochemical and infectivity data with this controversial

210

species should be obtained.

211

In a different approach, Lam et.al. used structural modeling to predict the change in free energy, ∆∆G,

212

for 215 ACE2 sequences derived from different species(44). They correlated the ∆∆G with published

213

infectability information to provide a framework to predict which species may be susceptible to SARS-

214

CoV-2 infection. Like other studies, their work suggests a broad range of mammal susceptibility, with

215

the exception of non-placental mammals. They similarly find that horseshoe bats have higher ∆∆G

216

values (i.e. lower affinity), calling into question their susceptibility and potential as a reservoir for SARS-

217

CoV-2.

218

There have been several studies that have measured the KD between SARS-CoV-2 spike (or RBD) and

219

ACE2, with values ranging from 1.2 to 44 nM (23,25,29,30). In these studies, differences in the

220

experimental conditions, such as whether ACE2 or RBD was immobilized, and technique used such as

221

biolayer interferometry versus surface plasmon resonance, could account for differences in kinetic

222

values. In our study, we immobilized ACE2 and measured RBD interaction as the analyte using

223

surface plasmon resonance, which is similar to Lan et. al. who reported a value of KD = 4.6 nM, which is

224

close to our value of 7.5 nM. However, Lan et.al. as well as all of the other studies utilized a 1:1 model

225

for binding, whereas we found evidence for a two site complexation on the surface, and applied a two

226

site model that gave KD1 and KD2 values of 7.5 nM and 0.4 nM, respectively. Of considerable note,

227

Forssen et.al. reanalyzed the binding data from Lan et.al. and Tian et.al. and found evidence of

228

multimeric interactions, similar to our study(45).

Since the RBD exists in close proximity to two other

229

RBD subunits in the spike protein trimer, it is plausible that cooperative interactions between RBDs

230

exist during ACE2 interaction events. Such events could considerably enhance the interactions

231

providing avidity to enable infection. In this regard, ACE2 variants from species with mutations in the

232

RBD interface may still be permissive to infection because of the cooperative and enhanced avidity of

233

binding events.

234

One of the major challenges in developing predictive methods for viral infectivity is the limited amount

235

of both infection and RBD-ACE2 biochemical interaction data for most species. For example, only few

236

species have had documented infection in the real world, or even in well-controlled experimental

237

systems(15,36,40,44). In this regard, detailed biochemical analysis of multiple species’ receptors

238

would provide valuable information that could be used in predictive modeling studies. With the

239

decreased costs of synthetic DNA and high-throughput screening approaches, such analyses could

240

potentially be accomplished rapidly. As a first step in this process, here we evaluate cow ACE2 for

241

binding SARS-CoV-2 RBD by both ELISA and surface plasmon resonance, a species with documented

242

experimental infection by SARS-CoV-2 and of significant agricultural importance that serves as a

243

reservoir for other betacoronaviruses, including at least one, HCoV-O43, that has jumped the species

244

barrier to become an endemic respiratory virus in humans. The affinity of bovine ACE2 is nearly ten-

245

fold worse than human ACE2 in binding the coronavirus RBD, however binding is still in the mid-

246

nanomolar range. Of potential importance is the possible cooperativity in binding that may occur

247

between ACE2 and RBD, which we observed in surface plasmon resonance analysis which suggested

248

a two-site model for binding. Interestingly, this data was consistent with ELISA binding data,

249

suggesting KD in the subnanomolar range for human, and low nanomolar range for bovine ACE2.

250

Further study into various species’ viral receptors, including the recently discovered neuropilin-2 co-

251

receptor for SARS-CoV-2(46), should enable much more accurate and rapid development of predictive

252

algorithms based on viral receptor sequence and structural modelling.

Methods

255

Sequence and structure analysis

256

ACE2 sequences from 19 species were obtained from the NCBI protein sequence database. A number

257

of multiple sequence alignments were performed using Clustal Omega. Specific multiple sequence

258

alignments for (i) companion animals (Canis lupus familiaris, Felis catus, Mus musculus, Mesocricetus

261

models or potential reservoirs of interest to vaccine testing research or suspected reservoirs (Macaca

262

mulatta, Macaca fascicularis, Felis catus, Manis javanica, Cricetulus griseus, Canis lupus familiaris,

263

Mustela putoris, Sus scrofa, Rhinolophus sinicus, Bos taurus) were investigated. In all sequence

264

alignments the Homo sapiens ACE2 sequence was included as a reference.

265

Further analysis on the multiple sequence alignments were carried out with a variety of software.

266

Phylogenetic trees and pairwise percent identities were obtained with Clustal Omega (47) and

267

visualized in UGENE (http://ugene.net). The open-source EMBL Boxshade Server was used to produce

268

the boxshade alignments (https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/BOX_form.html). The Protein Variability

269

Server (http://imed.med.ucm.es/PVS/) was employed to calculate Shannon Entropy values for each

270

residue position.

271

For structural analysis, the ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) complex structure

272

files (PDB) were obtained from the RCSB PDB (PDB ID: 6M17)(27). Eight contact residues of ACE2

273

were identified based on the co-crystal structure (27), and we additionally added 17 ACE2 residues

274

(nearby residues) that were within at least 5 angstroms of the RBD region and classified the full list as

275

“interaction residues”. Thus, there were a total of 25 interaction residues, with 8 known RBD contact

276

residues and 17 nearby residues. Using a de novo python script, these residues were extracted into a

277

separate “sequence” and an additional, specific multiple sequence alignment was constructed.

278

The interaction residue multiple sequence alignments were investigated to give more focused insight

279

into which species would be at risk of infection, with the assumption that residues directly interacting

280

with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein would be essential for infection. Structural analyses were

281

performed in Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD, https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).

282

Protein purification

283

Human and bovine ACE2 proteins were produced as fusion proteins to human IgG1 Fc according to

284

our published methods for monoclonal antibody purification[2-4]. Briefly, 30 M HEK293 Freestyle cells

285

were transfected with 293fectin combined with 30 µg of pFuse-based vectors containing the human or

286

bovine ACE2 fused to the human Fc region. Cells were shaken at 37 °C for 4 days with 8% CO2. The

287

media was clarified by centrifugation at 4000 RPM for 5 minutes followed by filtration through a 0.22 µm

288

filter. The media was concentrated and buffer-exchanged into PBS using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter

289

unit (MWCO = 10,000) (MilliporeSigma) at 4 °C. The concentrated media was then loaded onto a

290

protein A-sepharose column (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, followed

291

by washing of the column with 10 column volumes of the same buffer and eluted twice with 1 column

292

volume of 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.7 into fractions containing 0.1 column volume of 1M Tris, pH 8.

293

Purified proteins were buffer-exchanged into PBS using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter unit (MWCO =

294

10,000) (MilliporeSigma), quantified using 280 nM absorbance on a Nanodrop spectrophotometer

295

(Thermo Fisher Scientific), and resolved on an SDS-PAGE stained with InstantBlue Coomassie Protein

296

Stain (Abcam).

297

The SARS-CoV-2 RBD in plasmid NR-52309 (BEI Resources) was transfected and harvested as

298

described above, but purified using TALON cobalt metal affinity resin (Takara Bio) following the

299

manufacturer’s protocol, except that 50 mM, 100 mM, 200 mM and 300 mM imidazole gradient elution

300

fractions (1 column volume of each) were collected. Each elution fraction was resolved on an SDS-

301

PAGE gel stained with InstantBlue Coomassie Protein Stain (Abcam), and fractions containing a single

302

RBD band were pooled, buffer-exchanged into PBS and quantified as described above. Purified

303

protein was resolved on SDS-PAGE with Coomassie (Gel-code blue) staining.

304

Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

305

ELISA plates (Corning 3690) were coated with 100 ng soluble SARS-CoV-2 RBD at 4 ºC in 1 × PBS

306

(pH 7.4) overnight. Plates were washed three times with Tris buffered saline pH 7.4 containing 0.1%

307

Tween-20 (TBST) and blocked with 2% milk (Marvel, dried skim milk dissolved in TBST) at room

308

temperature for 1 h. Serially diluted human or bovine ACE2-Fc were added to the wells in 2%

309

milk/TBST, plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, washed four times with TBST and then

310

goat anti-human Fc-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch #109-035-098, diluted 1: 5000 in 2% milk/TBST)

311

was added to the wells. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes and washed five

312

times with TBST, then developed by adding 50 µl TMB substrate solution (Thermo Scientific) per well

313

and incubated at room temperature for 3 minutes. The HRP-TMB reaction was stopped by adding 50 µl

314

1.0 N sulfuric acid per well. The optical density at 450 nm was read on a microplate reader

315

(SPECTRAMAX M2, Molecular Devices). Antigen-binding curves and EC50 values were generated and

316

calculated using four parameter logistic regression in GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San

317

Diego, CA).

318

Surface plasmon resonance

319

Surface plasmon resonance of immobilized ACE2 proteins to RBD as the analyte was performed by

320

Biosensor Tools (https://www.biosensortools.com/ , Salt Lake City, Utah). ACE2-Fc ligands were

321

captured onto a Protein A surface at four different surface densities. Data were collected in Hepes

322

Buffered Saline (HBS) containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA at 25 degrees C. The RBD analyte (36 kDa) was

323

tested in a 3-fold titration series up to 1 uM and 100 nM for both ACE2 protein surfaces at the 4

Figure 1. ACE2 residues interacting with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. (A). The cocrystal structure for
the spike RBD (salmon color) and ACE2 (grey, PDB: 6M17) was used to visualize residues that contact
the RBD (shaded purple, Q24, D30, H34, Y41, Q42, M82, K353, R357) or are within 5 A of the RBD
(shaded cyan, K26, T27, F28, K31, K35, E37, D38, L45, L79, Q81, Y83, T324, N330, G352, G354, ,
D355, R393). Throughout the manuscript we refer to these as “contact residues” (purple) and “nearby
residues” (cyan), and together as “interacting residues”. (B) Top down view of ACE2 in space filling
mode, with residues color-coded as in (A). G352 is not visible in this orientation. (C) Boxshade

as a reference, the variant interacting residues for each species are colored red, and conserved
residues colored cyan. For the remainder of the ACE2 protein, conserved residues are white and
variable residues light red. Certain residues like M82, Q24, D30, and H34 are often mutated relative to
human. D30 is conservatively changed to glutamate, however more non-conservative changes can be
seen for H34, for example. More species have been analyzed and are shown in Supplemental Figure
