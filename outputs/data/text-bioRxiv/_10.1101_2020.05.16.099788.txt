Abstract: Nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates cellular redox balance and the expression of
a wide array of genes involved in immunity and inflammation, including antiviral actions. Nrf2
activity declines with age, making the elderly more susceptible to oxidative stress-mediated
diseases, which include type 2 diabetes, chronic inflammation, and viral infections. Published
evidence suggests that Nrf2 activity may regulate important mechanisms affecting viral
susceptibility and replication. We examined gene expression levels by GeneChip microarray and
by RNA-seq assays. We found that the potent Nrf2 activating composition PB125® downregulates
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in human liver-derived HepG2 cells. ACE2 is a surface
receptor and TMPRSS2 activates the spike protein for SARS-Cov-2 entry into host cells.
Furthermore, in endotoxin-stimulated primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells we report
the marked downregulation by PB125 of 36 genes encoding cytokines. These include IL1-beta, IL6,
TNF- the cell adhesion molecules ICAM1, VCAM1, and E-selectin, and a group of IFN--induced
genes. Many of these cytokines have been specifically identified in the “cytokine storm” observed
in fatal cases of COVID-19, suggesting that Nrf2 activation may significantly decrease the intensity
of the storm.

1. Introduction

30

Nrf2, is a transcription factor encoded in humans by the NFE2L2 gene. It has been called by
many the “master regulator of cellular redox homeostasis” [1], as well as the “guardian of
healthspan” and “gatekeeper of species longevity” [2]. Nrf2 regulates most of the genes that defends
us against oxidative stress, including superoxide dismutases, catalase, numerous peroxidases, and
glutathione metabolism, as well as hundreds of genes involved in scores of important metabolic
pathways [3]. The individual vulnerabilities of various structural and catalytic gene products to
damage or inactivation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) may lead to degenerative diseases and
metabolic dysfunctions. Importantly, Nrf2 declines with age [4,5] and contributes greatly to the
“frailty” associated with aging [6-8]. Because Nrf2 transcriptionally upregulates genes that combat
oxidative stress, its loss allows oxidative stress to go unmitigated and drive the aging phenotype
[1,8,9]. Oxidative stress is therefore a common theme among the key features associated with the
aging process, collectively referred to as the “hallmarks of aging”, as it disrupts proteostasis [10],
alters genomic stability [11], alters susceptibility to viral and microbial infections [12], and leads to
cell death. It is this age-related frailty [8] that often defines the most vulnerable population in
situations such as the one we currently face with the coronavirus pandemic [13].

A number of published studies have implicated Nrf2 as a regulator of susceptibility to
respiratory viral infections. A recent review by Lee [14] points out that virus-induced modulation
of the host antioxidative response has turned out to be a crucial determinant for the progression of
several viral diseases. A virus needs to keep oxidative stress at a level optimal for viral
reproduction, which is higher than normal, to support the viral metabolism but should not be so high
as to kill off the host cell. Viruses have evolved mechanisms for manipulating the Nrf2 pathway in
both directions, depending on the needs of the virus, but importantly taking control away from the
host cell. Among the types of virus studied are influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),
and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [12,15-18]. The phenomenon is also seen in non-respiratory
viruses including Dengue virus (DENV) [19], rotavirus [20], herpes simplex virus [21], Zika virus
[22], and HIV [23], suggesting that regulation of oxidative stress may be a need common to most, if
not all viruses, and that Nrf2 activators may offer multiple ways to regain control of important
pathways to increase resistance and slow viral replication. We recently described a phytochemical
composition, PB125, that potently activates Nrf2 by controlling multiple steps involved in the process,
especially via the Akt1/PI3K/GSK3/Fyn pathway [24].
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of Nrf2 activation via PB125 on human
liver-derived HepG2 cells as well as on primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC)
in culture. The endothelial cell has been recently implicated as a major player in the tissue
destruction caused by COVID-19. Varga et al. performed post-mortem analysis of COVID-19
patients finding involvement of endothelial cells across vascular beds of multiple organs, including
electron microscopic evidence of virus particles in renal endothelial cells [25]. Ackermann et al. also
documented virus particles inside the cells. Moreover, they found the lungs of Covid-19 patients
had a distorted vascularity with structurally deformed capillaries that showed sudden changes in
diameter and the presence of intussusceptive pillars that might be explained by drastically
dysregulated angiogenesis [26]. These findings broaden the focus of COVID-19 from a disease of
pulmonary epithelium to one of multi-organ vascular endothelium. Thus, we measured the
expression of genes known to be important for antiviral activity in general, as well as genes with
specific relevance to COVID-19 such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2 which determine whether cell types are
susceptible to viral entry [27], HDAC5 which helps maintain Nrf2 in an activated state [28],
plasminogen (PLG) which is newly recognized as a regulator of cytokine signaling [29], and tissue
plasminogen activator inhibitor, PAI-1 (SERPINE1) which has recently been shown to play an
important role in the inhibition of host proteases (including TMPRSS2) responsible for influenza A
virus maturation and spread [30]. In addition, a group of 36 cytokines expressed by endothelial cells
was significantly downregulated suggesting that PB125 might be useful in attenuating the overexuberant production of cytokines known as cytokine release syndrome or a “cytokine storm” that
characterizes a small group of hyperinflammatory conditions that includes graft versus host disease
[31], acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19 [32].

2.2. Cell Culture

95

106

We utilized the human HepG2 cell line (hepatocellular carcinoma) and primary human
pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) for genomic assays. HepG2 and HPAEC cells are
suitable models in the present work because they each have a Nrf2 pathway that responds in a normal
manner to Nrf2 activators [33,34], and do not have reported mutations in Nrf2/KEAP1. The HepG2
cells were cultured and maintained by standard methods, using Opti-MEM medium with 4% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and geneticin/penicillin/streptomycin. HPAEC cells were procured from Lonza
(catalog # CC-2530) and cultured in Endothelial Basal Media-2 (Lonza catalog #: CC-3516)
supplemented with endothelial growth factors optimized for aortic and pulmonary arterial
endothelial cells (Lonza catalog # CC-3162). HPAEC subculturing was limited to six passages in order
to prevent senescence and de-differentiation. HPAEC were seeded at a density of 5 x 105 cells per
100 mm tissue culture dishes and incubated at 37oC and 6.5% CO2 to 80-90% confluence. All
experiments were performed with HPAEC at 80-90% confluence.

107

2.3. IL-6 Protein Assay

108

110

We used the Human IL-6 Quantiglo ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions to determine the concentration of IL-6 protein released from HPAEC
cultured under various conditions.

111

2.4. Gene Expression Assays

112

2.4.1. Cell Culture and RNA Isolation

113

122

To examine the effects of PB125 on gene expression in HepG2 cells, the cells were subcultured
in 24-well plates then treated overnight with 0 (control) or 16 μg/mL PB125 (as a 50 mg/mL extract in
100% ethanol). To examine the effects of PB125 on genes that are induced by endotoxin exposure and
which may contribute to the cytokine storm (as is observed in COVID-19 illness), we examined a
model of pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treated human pulmonary arterial endothelial
cells, with and without treatment with PB125. HPAEC cells were cultured overnight in 24-well plates
under four conditions: control (untreated); PB125-treated (at 5 µg/mL); LPS-treated (at 20 ng/mL);
and PB125 + LPS treated. Cells were washed twice with PBS, then extracted with Trizol for total RNA
isolation. Further purified with Qiagen RNeasy clean-up columns (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA)
as previously described [24].

123

2.4.2. Microarray Assays

124

For each sample RNA concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm with a NanoDrop
spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). RNA quality was assessed by
Agilent TapeStation 2200 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Gene expressions were determined by the
University of Colorado AMC Genomics and Microarray Core facility (Aurora, CO, USA). The
GeneChip 3’ IVT PLUS Reagent Kit (Affymetrix/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was
used to convert 150 ng of total RNA to cDNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Each labeled
sample was assayed with the Affymetrix PrimeView human gene expression array read with an
Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
The gene transcript and variants are examined using 9–11 perfectly matched (PM) probes. The
intensity of expression for all genes on the microarray were evaluated using Affymetrix GeneChip
software (Affymetrix/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) which supported pair-wise
comparison between microarray chips.

instructions for the TruSeq RNA kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). With this kit, mRNA is first
isolated from total RNA using polyA selection, then the mRNA is fragmented and primed for creation
of double-stranded cDNA fragments. Following this, the cDNA fragments are amplified, selected by
size, and purified for cluster generation. Subsequently, the mRNA template libraries were
sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with single pass 50
bp reads at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Center Genomics and Microarray Core
Facility (Aurora, CO, USA). Samples were sequenced at a depth to provide approximately 40M single
pass 50 bases reads per sample. The derived sequences were then analyzed with a custom
computational pipeline comprising the open-source GSNAP [35] Cufflinks [36] and R for sequence
alignment and determination of differential gene expression [37]. Reads generated were mapped
by GSNAP [35] to the human genome (GRCH38), expression (FPKM) derived by Cufflinks [36], and
differential expression analyzed with ANOVA in R.

2.5. Statistical Analysis

153

156

The data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). One-way ANOVA with
Tukey multiple comparisons testing or Student’s t test for unpaired data were performed using Prism
software (version 6.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Statistical significance was set at
p value < 0.05.

3. Results

158

3.1. IL-6 Protein Release

159

Using the ELISA assay for IL-6, we determined that pretreatment of HPAEC with PB125
decreased the LPS-induced release of IL-6 protein from the HPAEC cells. In this study, the HPAEC
cells were plated as described above, then after 24 h they were treated with 5 ug/mL of PB125 extract
or with the corresponding amounts of vehicle control. After an additional 16 h of incubation, the cells
were treated by adding 20 ng of LPS (or vehicle control) per mL of medium. Each of the four
treatment groups was run in triplicate. After 5 hours of LPS treatment, aliquots of cell culture
medium were removed from each well for IL-6 measurement by ELISA. LPS stimulation of the
vehicle-pretreated HPAEC greatly increased the release of IL-6 protein in to the culture media, but
this LPS-induced IL-6 release was reduced by 61% in the cells pretreated with PB125 (p = 0.0067).
The results are shown in Figure 1.

3.2. Gene Expression

170

3.2.1. HepG2 Gene Expression by RNA-seq

171

Because SARS-CoV-2 entry into a human cell depends on ACE2 for binding and on TMPRSS2
for proteolytic activation of the spike protein [27], we examined the effects of PB125 on the expression
of these two genes. Because inhibition of the protease activity of TMPRSS2 has been shown to block
viral entry [27], we also examined the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1,
encoded by the SERPINE1 gene), a normal plasma component and known potent inhibitor of
TMPRSS2 [30]. ACE2 mRNA was down regulated -3.5-fold and TMPRSS2 was down-regulated 2.8-fold by PB125 in human liver-derived HepG2 cells, as seen in Figure 2. While these impediments
may not completely block viral entry, they may significantly impair it, slowing the rate of viral
progression. Furthermore, PB125 strongly up regulated SERPINE1/PAI-1 by 17.8-fold. PB125 downregulated HDAC5 in human liver cells by -2.8-fold, also shown in Figure 2. In humans, HDAC5
appears to be responsible for the deacetylation and attenuation of Nrf2 activity [28]. The cytokine
LIF, an important antiviral cellular response to viral infection [38,39], was up regulated 6.6-fold by
PB125. Because of recent evidence that plasmin can trigger substantial proinflammatory release of
cytokines [29], we examined the effect of PB125 on plasminogen (PLG) mRNA expression, finding it
to be down regulated by -1.9-fold. Thus, all six of these gene regulatory effects of PB125 would
appear to counter viral attempts to enter the cell and/or to usurp control of oxidative stress response.

All six genes differed from control by p < 0.04.

3.2.2. HPAEC Gene Expression by Microarray

188

To examine the effects of PB125 on genes that may contribute to the COVID-19-induced cytokine
storm, we examined a model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treated HPAEC, with and without
treatment with PB125. The results are seen in Figure 3. All 36 genes were significantly upregulated
by LPS and normalized to 100% indicated by the red bar (no PB125). Sixteen cytokines, including
two colony stimulating factors, are shown in green, with mRNAs downregulated by PB125 as
indicated.
The average percent inhibition for the group of cytokines was 70%.
Two
proinflammatory interleukins, IL-1B and IL-6, showed mRNAs inhibited 61% and 44%, respectively.
Three proinflammatory cytokine-induced adhesion molecules, intercellular adhesion molecule 1

group of five TNF-induced proteins (TNFAIPs) were repressed even more, averaging 70%. Four
other genes representing the TNF family were downregulated an average of 65%. Also, a family of
five interferon-inducible genes are shown to be downregulated an average of 63%. This across-theboard reduction of genes that contribute to the “cytokine storm” is noteworthy as it is the intensity

of this storm that predicts ICU fatalities from COVID-19 [32]. Transforming this storm into a
manageable “shower” is therefore a major therapeutic objective in the clinical management of
COVID-19 patients.

4. Discussion

206

The last decade has seen more than 10,000 publications on Nrf2 and its involvement in redox
homeostasis, inflammation and immunity, neurodegeneration, aging and diseases associated with
aging, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and many other areas, but relatively little has been published
regarding its roles in viral infectivity and resistance, despite some rather tantalizing studies. Kesic
et al. showed that siRNA knockdown of Nrf2 expression in human nasal epithelial cells effectively
decreased both Nrf2 mRNA and Nrf2 protein expression in these cells, which correlated with
significantly increased entry of influenza A/Bangkok/1/79 (H3N2 serotype) and replication in the
transduced human cells [12]. Importantly, they also demonstrated that enhancing Nrf2 activation
via supplementation with sulforaphane (SFN) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) increased
antiviral mediators in the absence of viral infection and also abrogated viral entry. Yegeta et al. took
a different approach and increased oxidative stress, not just by manipulating Nrf2 expression
genetically, but by alternatively exposing mice to an exogenous oxidative stress—cigarette smoke

[15]. Cigarette smoke-exposed Nrf2-deficient mice showed higher rates of mortality than did wildtype mice after influenza virus infection, with enhanced peribronchial inflammation, lung
permeability damage, and mucus hypersecretion. Cho et al. [40] have similarly studied respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) infection, the single most important virus causing acute respiratory tract
infections in children. They found that Nrf2-/- mice infected with RSV showed significantly increased
bronchopulmonary inflammation, epithelial injury, and mucus cell metaplasia as well as nasal
epithelial injury when compared to similarly infected Nrf2+/+ WT mice. The Nrf2-/- mice also showed
significantly attenuated viral clearance and IFN-γ, and greater weight loss.
Importantly,
pretreatment with oral sulforaphane significantly limited lung RSV replication and virus-induced
inflammation in Nrf2+/+ WT mice. Komaravelli et al. [16-18] have noted that RSV not only causes
increased production of ROS but actively lowers expression of antioxidant enzymes by increasing the rate of
proteasomal degradation of Nrf2. At 6 h post-infection Nrf2-dependent gene transcription was increased,
indicating that the cell is in control and responding to the insult of viral infection and the increase in
oxidative stress. By 15 h post-infection, however, the concentration of Nrf2 had dropped
significantly to about half its pre-infection level reflecting a change-of-control to favor the virus. To
accomplish this RSV had increased Nrf2 ubiquitination, triggering its proteasomal degradation,
representing one example by which viruses subvert cellular antioxidant defenses. Taken together,
these studies demonstrate the ability of Nrf2 to impede viral entry, slow viral replication, reduce
inflammation, weight loss, and mortality, but without providing much detailed insight as to which
genes and pathways are involved.
The first challenge facing a virus, and particularly a virus that is jumping from one host species
to another, is gaining entry to the cell. There are some fairly common ports of entry such as LDLR
and ICAM-1 that lead to endosomal entry and which are shared among various viral families [41].
SARS-CoV-2, however, seems to be largely if not totally restricted to a very specific mode of entry.
The unique mode of entry may be the greatest vulnerability for the virus, opening the door to some
potentially effective therapies. Substantial evidence suggests that a transmembrane protease
encoded by the TMPRSS2 gene plays a critical role in the entry for SARS and MERS coronavirus, for
2013 Asian H7N9 influenza virus, and for several H1N1 subtype influenza A virus infections [27,4245], suggesting that targeting TMPRSS2 could be a novel antiviral strategy to treat coronavirus [42].
Hoffmann and coworkers found that infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19,
may depend almost exclusively on the host cell factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 [27]. The spike (S)
protein of coronaviruses facilitates viral entry into target cells. Entry depends on binding of the S
protein to a cellular receptor, ACE2, which facilitates viral attachment to the surface of target cells. In
addition, entry requires S protein “priming” by the cellular protease TMPRSS2, which entails S
protein cleavage and allows fusion of viral and cellular membranes (Figure 4). This priming can be
blocked by clinically proven protease inhibitors of the TMPRSS2, Camostat mesylate [27,46] and
Nafamostat mesylate [47]. Nafamostat is remarkably potent with an IC50 in the nanomolar range for
blocking cellular entry of MERS-CoV in vitro, but has not been clinically tested as an antiviral in
humans. The drug appears not to be available at present in an oral formulation, and because of its
lack of specificity there is concern over possible side effects [47]. It may prove suitable for treatment
of severe COVID-19 cases.
TMPRSS2 can also be blocked by the human anti-protease Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1, or
PAI-1 [34], as shown in Figure 4. Iwata-Yoshikawa et al. [43] found that knockout of TMPRSS2
improved both pathology and immunopathology in the bronchi and/or alveoli after infection of the
mice by SARS-CoV and completely prevented loss of body weight. This is especially noteworthy in
SARS-CoV infection where TMPRSS2 is not the sole mechanism for entry, as is the case with SARSCoV-2. Thus, our data showing that PB125 down regulated ACE2 by -3.5-fold, down regulated
TMPRSS2 by -2.8-fold, and up regulated PAI-1, the potent TMPRSS2 inhibitor, by 17.8-fold (Figure
2) strongly suggest that PB125 treatment might diminish the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to bind to a host
cell and to obtain spike protein activation as a result of less ACE2 and TMPRSS2 on the cell surface,
and as a result of a 17.8-fold increase in plasma PAI-1, which would inhibit the remaining TMPRSS2.
Dittmann et al. [30] have found that influenza A virus (IAV) infection provokes a host response that

Spike protein must then be cleaved (indicated as scissors representing serine

protease TMPRSS2) to allow entry into the cell (2). The activated spike protein penetrates the cell
membrane (3) allowing entry of the viral genome (4), which is replicated, translated, and assembled
into mature virus particles (5). On the left, TMPRSS2 inhibition is shown by the antiviral drugs
Camostat and Nafamostat, as well as by plasminogen activator inhibitor, PAI-1, encoded by the
SERPINE1 gene. PB125 up regulates PAI-2 and downregulates both TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in HepG2
cells.

is both necessary and sufficient for viral inhibition—increased production of PAI-1. They found that
for IAV, proteolytic cleavage of the viral coat protein hemagglutinin by host proteases (such as
plasmin or TMPRSS2) was a requirement for maturation and infectivity of progeny particles.
Addition of recombinant PAI to the apical side of HAEC significantly reduced IAV growth compared
to carrier control, with about 90% inhibition of infectivity at 48 h post infection. In contrast, addition
of -PAI-1 antibody dramatically enhanced IAV growth. Thus, many viruses rely on both host
endo- and exo-proteases for various entry and maturation functions. Moreover, they found that
TMPRSS2, necessary for SARS-Cov-2 infection, is among the trypsin-like proteases effectively
inhibited by PAI-1 [30].
A recent publication by Kumar et al. [48] has used computer modeling to predict that withaferin
A and withanone, present in extracts of the Ayurvedic plant Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera),
stably interact at the catalytic site of TMPRSS2, mimicking the pharmaceutical inhibitor Camostat
mesylate [27,46,48]. In addition, Kumar et al. found that withanone down regulated the TMPRSS2
gene similarly to what we report here with PB125 (Figure 2). Ashwagandha is one of the three
components of PB125, so there is a probability that PB125 may both inhibit the enzymatic activity of
TMPRSS2 as well as down regulating the expression of its mRNA.
Quite apart from direct involvement with viral entry mechanisms, PB125 down-regulates
HDAC5 in human liver-derived HepG2 cells by -2.8-fold, also shown in Figure 2. Acetylation of
Nrf2 increases binding of Nrf2 to its cognate response element in a target gene promoter, and
increases Nrf2-dependent transcription of target genes [49]. In humans, HDAC5 appears to be the
isozyme responsible for the deacetylation and attenuation of Nrf2 activity [28], and is likely the gene
up-regulated by RSV infection described above by Komaravelli et al. [18]. Thus PB125, by inhibiting
the deacetylation and subsequent degradation of Nrf2, maintains more active acetylated Nrf2 in the
nucleus for a longer time, counteracting one of the mechanisms enumerated above by which viruses

attempt to commandeer control of the cell’s redox status and, indirectly, amplifying all Nrf2dependent actions.
The upregulation of the cytokine LIF, an important antiviral cellular response to viral infection,
is shown to be strongly up-regulated by PB125 in Figure 2, again countering potential attempts by a
virus to down-regulate it. LIF gene expression was downregulated by H7N9 infection, and knockdown of LIF increased virus titers for three influenza A strains investigated, indicating an important
role of LIF in virus defense [39]. In vivo studies were performed with LIF knock-out mice that were
infected with RSV. LIF knock-out mice yielded higher virus titers compared to control mice, and LIF
signaling was shown to be critical for the protection of the lung from injury during [38].
While we have discussed the role of PAI-1 in preventing TMPRSS2 from activating the SARSCoV-2 spike protein, mention should also be made of what many would consider its “real job”, the
blocking of the conversion of plasminogen (encoded by the PLG gene) to plasmin by both urokinasetype plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Fibrinolysis was the first
recognized function for plasmin, so one might expect that high expression of PAI-1 would cause low
plasmin levels which might be a risk factor for venous thrombosis. Genetic plasminogen deficiency,
however, is not strongly associated with risk of thrombosis [50]. In a study of 23 subjects with
homozygous mutations in the PLG gene and little or no detectable plasmin, 96% had clinical
inflammation of the conjunctivae (ligneous conjunctivitis) but 0% had experienced venous
thrombosis [51]. New roles, however, have been recognized for plasmin regarding cytokine release
[29,31,52-54]. A “cytokine storm syndrome” is a form of systemic inflammatory response that can
be triggered by a variety of factors such as severe infections. It occurs when large numbers of
leukocytes are activated and release inflammatory cytokines, which in turn activate yet more
leukocytes. Sato et al. found that pharmacological inhibition of plasmin significantly prevented
mortality in a mouse model of acute graft-versus-host disease, proposing that plasmin inhibition
could offer a novel therapeutic strategy to control the deadly cytokine storm that results from graftversus-host disease, preventing tissue destruction [31]. Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is
a life-threatening disorder characterized by a cytokine storm and multiorgan dysfunction due to
excessive immune activation. In a mouse model of MAS, Shimazu et al. saw a similar prevention in
lethality, concluding that plasmin regulates the influx of inflammatory cells and the production of
inflammatory cytokines/chemokines [29]. Plasminogen has also been implicated in activation of
astrocytes to produce an array of proinflammatory cytokines [54]. In Figure 2 we report that PB125
downregulates plasminogen mRNA by -1.9-fold in liver cells. Thus, in vivo we speculate that the
combined downregulation of plasminogen and 17.8-fold increase of PAI-1 (which covalently reacts
with and deactivates both tissue- and urokinase-type plasminogen activators) may significantly
attenuate the plasmin-induced cytokine storm phenomenon.
Hyper-inflammation in COVID-19 is associated with such an elevation of proinflammatory
cytokines, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) and a large number of TNF-induced
proteins, and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF or CSF3). Among 41 hospitalized
COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, all had elevated IL1B, IP10/CXCL10, and MCP1/CCL2. Sixteen
of the patients were subsequently admitted to the ICU and had even higher plasma levels of
GCSF/CSF3, IP10/CXCL10, MCP1/CCL2, MIP1A/CCL3, and TNFα, and the intensity of the cytokine
storm was a strong prognosticator of mortality [55]. All of these genes encoding these COVID-19related cytokines appear in Figure 3 as they were significantly up regulated by LPS-treated HPAEC,
and significantly down regulated by PB125 treatment. Importantly, a growing number of studies
conclude that cytokine storm syndrome is the direct cause of death in most COVID-19 fatalities [5558].
We speculate that the well-documented age-related loss of Nrf2 expression [4,5] is a potential
contributor to the occurrence of a cytokine storm. A longitudinal study of 40 confirmed COVID-19
patients [59] showed that the 13 severe cases, compared to the 27 milder cases, were older (mean age
59.7 vs 43.2), had significantly elevated C-reactive protein (mean 62.9 vs 7.6 mg/l), and showed
consistently higher neutrophil counts and lower lymphocyte counts throughout the two week
observation period. These observations [55,59] document a clear predilection for severity of COVID-

19 infection directly associated with age and intensity of inflammatory response, and presumably
inversely associated with Nrf2 expression [8]. The production and self-amplifying nature of an
acute inflammatory response demands a prompt subsequent “survival response” from the host tissue
to break the self-sustaining attraction of neutrophils to inflamed tissues. We propose that it is a
robust oxidative stress-induced activation of Nrf2 in young healthy individuals that follows the
gathering storm and rescues host tissues from irretrievable self-inflicted damage. In older
individuals, or in the presence of comorbidities that may involve chronic inflammation, the Nrf2activation response may be insufficient to break the self-perpetuating cycle of events. Figure 5
illustrates this proposed sequence of events. We propose that activating a larger fraction of the
limited Nrf2 available in the elderly or otherwise compromised patients might allow them, like their
younger counterparts, to shut down cytokine production to stop the escalating cytokine storm, and
to begin the recovery and repair phase of the inflammatory episode. This activation boost to
suboptimal levels of Nrf2 can be provided by several pharmacological agents, and as well or better
by a number of phytochemical activators, as we show here with PB125.

Figure 5. Development and resolution of an acute inflammatory event. 1) Initiation occurs with
bacterial or viral infection, which triggers 2) local production of cytokines by endothelial cells to call
in inflammatory cells to neutralize the invasion.

3) An attack ensues in which superoxide and

secondary oxidants are produced, phagocytosis occurs, and more cytokines are released by the first
responders, calling in subsequent waves of activated inflammatory cells. 4) In young healthy cells
the oxidative stress generated by the battle activates Nrf2 and within hours the nearby tissues are
inhibiting further tissue cytokine production, rescuing host cells from further damage and permitting
5) repair, cleanup, and recovery. Alternatively, in 4a) older cells deficient in Nrf2 may be unable to
mount Nrf2 activation sufficient to break the self-sustaining chain reaction, resulting in an

uncontrolled cytokine storm that ultimately destroys the host tissue and leads to death. A more
robust activation of the limited Nrf2 available in older cells may be provided by pharmacological or
phytochemical Nrf2 activators.

It is worth noting that the longitudinal study of COVID-19 patients [59] reported a remarkably
higher concentration of serum ferritin in the severe cases (averaging 835.5 g/l, with a range of 635.4
to 1538.8) versus the milder cases (averaging 367.8 g/l, with a range of 174.7 to 522.0). Ferritin has
long been recognized as a source of iron released under inflammatory conditions by the superoxide
radical [60-63]. Under the intense oxidative stress precipitated by a cytokine storm, the release of
iron would catalyze lipid peroxidation and greatly amplify host tissue injury. COVID-19 has

already been added to the short list of known “hyperferritinemic” diseases, all of which are
characterized by high serum ferritin and life threatening hyper-inflammation sustained by a
cytokines storm which eventually leads to multi-organ failure [64]. Ferroptosis is a newly described
form of regulated cell death that is iron-dependent and causes cell death by mitochondrial
dysfunction and toxic lipid peroxidation. Nrf2 has been implicated as a “key deterministic
component modulating the onset and outcomes of ferroptotic stress” [65].
We studied three different phenomena that may be involved in vulnerability to the SARS-Cov2, and these interactive phenomena are not all present in any single cell type. The first objective, to
study the effects of PB125 on expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, could be studied in presumed pointof-entry cells, including alveolar Type II cells [27] and HPAEC [25,26]. There are both clinical and
laboratory suggestions that the virus may invade many organs containing cell types that co-express
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (heart, gut, kidney, eye), including liver, where we showed down regulation of
both ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Thus, liver is also a relevant cell in which to study these entry genes. A
second objective was to examine whether PB125 could limit systemic plasmin activity by down
regulation of PLG and/or upregulation of PAI-1, both plasma proteins not produced by the cells of
the lung. In this case, the liver is the source of PLG, and is the appropriate cell type to examine. The
source of PAI-1 in plasma isn't known, but may be liver or muscle. For the third objective of whether
PB125 could down regulate the cytokines identified as participating in the cytokine storm
phenomenon, we believe the focus on primary HPAEC is appropriate, although a more complete
picture would include study of the inflammatory cell types themselves. HPAEC generate the 36
cytokines we examined, sounding the systemic alarm that recruits inflammatory cells to the infected
organ. The Type II alveolar cell has very little capacity for producing cytokines [66]. For studying
how an intervention can break the inflammatory cycle leading to a cytokine storm, we believe
vascular endothelial cells may be the single most important players. A potential limitation of the
study is the use of LPS as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 to induce the inflammatory response.
We propose that one evolutionary driving force for the Nrf2 pathway may have been to provide
a failsafe brake for out-of-control inflammatory events. The increase in oxidative stress at the site of
an intense inflammatory locus may have been the intended trigger for a system to activate Nrf2,
allowing it to end the assault at a point where the invader has likely been vanquished but from which
the host may be able to survive. In fact, the cadre of genes induced by Nrf2 have long been referred
to as “survival genes” [3].

5. Conclusions

398

We have shown that a group of 42 genes linked to respiratory virus infectivity and resistance, or
to the associated immune response, are responsive to pharmacological Nrf2 activation. It seems
possible that the sum total of these multiple antiviral effects may confer a degree of resistance, may
attenuate viral replication rate, may alleviate symptoms by limiting microvascular injury, and
perhaps allow successful navigation through the “cytokine storm” that is a particular problem with
COVID-19. Even though the never-ending evolutionary war-of-wits continues, and the viruses
occasionally win a battle, this scenario of the complex and multi-faceted antiviral mechanisms
regulated by Nrf2 serves to underscore the importance of this very central transcription factor in
keeping us protected and functional.
