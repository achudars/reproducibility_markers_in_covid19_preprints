The devastating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to SARS-CoV-2, has
caused more than 47 million confirmed cases and more than 1.2 million human deaths around the
globe1, and most of the severe cases of COVID-19 in humans are associated with neurological
symptoms such as anosmia and ageusia, and uncontrolled inflammatory immune response2-5.
Among therapeutic options6-8, the use of the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin (IVM), has been
proposed, given its possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity9. Ivermectin is a positive allosteric modulator
of the α−7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor10, which has been suggested to represent a target for
the control of Covid-19 infection11 , with a potential immunomodulatory activity12. We assessed
the effects of IVM in SARS-CoV-2-intranasally-inoculated golden Syrian hamsters. Even though
ivermectin had no effect on viral load, SARS-Cov-2-associated pathology was greatly attenuated.
IVM had a sex-dependent and compartmentalized immunomodulatory effect, preventing clinical
deterioration and reducing olfactory deficit in infected animals. Importantly, ivermectin
dramatically reduced the Il-6/Il-10 ratio in lung tissue, which likely accounts for the more favorable
clinical presentation in treated animals. Our data support IVM as a promising anti-COVID-19 drug
candidate.

16

Coronaviruses cause respiratory disease in a wide variety of hosts. During the ongoing

17

pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, clinical signs other than respiratory symptoms have

18

been linked to infection, frequently associated with an altered sense of smell and by high mortality in

19

some COVID-19 patients. These features seem related to the over-responsiveness of patients’

20

immune system to SARS-CoV-2, sometimes referred to as ‘cytokine storm’

21

4,5,13

.

Ivermectin (IVM), a macrocyclic lactone, is a commercially-available anti-parasitic drug which
12,14

22

induces effects in various endo- and ectoparasites, mycobacteria and even some viruses

. IVM is

23

an efficient positive allosteric modulator of the α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and of

24

several ligand-gated ion channels, including the muscle receptor for glutamate (GluCl) in worms .

25

Furthermore, IVM has been shown to modulate the host’s immune system

10

12,14

under conditions that

15

26

are known to involve the α-7 receptor . An IVM anti-COVID-19 effect has been hypothesized due to

27

similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and other nicotinic receptor ligand sequences .

28

inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero/hSLAM cells has also been reported, albeit at much

29

higher concentrations (50- to 100-fold) than those clinically attainable in human patients (150-400

30

µg/kg)

.

31

Several clinical trials using IVM have been initiated either alone or in combination with other

32

molecules . IVM has already been administered to hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with contrasting

33

outcomes: one study related no efficacy of late IVM administration (8-18 days after symptoms onset)

34

in severe COVID-19 patients treated in combination with other drugs (hydroxychloroquine,

35

azithromycin, tocilizumab, steroids) , whereas another study observed lower mortality, especially in

11

infection, animals received a single subcutaneous injection of IVM at the anti-parasitic dose of 400

14

IVM-treated and infected animals exhibited a significant reduction in the severity of clinical

15

signs (Fig. 1a) and remarkably, IVM treatment reduced the olfactory deficit in infected animals:

16

66.7% (12/18) of the saline-treated hamsters presented with hyposmia/anosmia, whereas only

17

22.2% (4/18) of IVM-treated hamsters presented signs of olfactory dysfunction (Fisher's exact test

18

p=0.018; Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1). This effect was sex-dependent: infected males presented a

19

reduction in the clinical score (Fig. 1b) whereas a complete absence of signs was noticed in the

20

infected females (Fig. 1c). Regarding the olfactory performance, 83.3% (10/12) of the saline-treated

21

males presented with hyposmia/anosmia, in contrast to only 33.3% (4/12) of IVM-treated males

22

(Fisher's exact test p=0.036). Furthermore, no olfactory deficit was observed in IVM-treated females

23

(0/6), while 33.3% (2/6) of saline-treated females presented with hyposmia/anosmia (Fisher's exact

24

test p=0.455). The IVM-treated and infected animals presented, however, a transient decrease of

25

body weight similar to that observed in saline-treated and infected hamsters (Extended Data Fig. 1).

26

Since males presented a high index of anosmia/hyposmia, we subsequently performed a dose-

27

response curve to test the effect of IVM on the clinical presentation of infected males: lower doses of

28

IVM (100 or 200 µg/kg) elicited similar clinical outcomes as the anti-parasitic dose of 400 µg/kg

29

(Extended Data Fig. 2). As expected, no signs of olfactory deficit were observed in the mock-infected

30

hamsters (Extended Data Fig. 1). Despite sex differences, IVM treatment reduced clinical

31

deterioration in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, and even prevented the occurrence of anosmia, a

infected hamsters. We assayed two airway compartments: nasal turbinates and lungs.

In the nasal turbinates, upon treatment with IVM, there were marked differences between sex

12

of the inflammatory response in the lung (down-regulation of

20

The viral RNA load in the respiratory tract remained unaffected by IVM treatment in both nasal

21

turbinates and lung samples. These were tested using both classical RT-qPCR (Fig. 2c) and the highly

22

sensitive technique of digital droplet

23

treatment did not influence the viral replication rate, as evaluated by the ratio between structural

24

and non-structural gene transcription (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig.5). Finally, IVM treatment did not

alter infectious viral titers in the lungs (Fig. 2e). These results differ from a previous report suggesting

26

that IVM, albeit used at far higher concentrations, inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2

In humans, IVM is widely used as anti-helminthic and anti-scabies at therapeutic doses (15016

31

considerable sex differences are observed in terms of clinical presentation in hamsters, as is seen in

32

human COVID-19 patients, where men tend to develop more severe disease than women

33

Further studies are needed to assess the effects of IVM when administered at later time-points

34

during the course of the disease. Considering the results observed in our golden hamster model,

35

together with their limitations, IVM may be considered as a new category of therapeutic agent

Methods
Ethics. All animal experiments were performed according to the French legislation and in compliance

3

with the European Communities Council Directives (2010/63/UE, French Law 2013–118, February 6,

4

2013) and according to the regulations of Pasteur Institute Animal Care Committees. The Animal

5

Experimentation Ethics Committee (CETEA 89) of the Institut Pasteur approved this study (200023;

6

APAFIS#25326-2020050617114340 v2) before experiments were initiated. Hamsters were housed by

7

groups of 4 animals in isolators and manipulated in class III safety cabinets in the Pasteur Institute

8

animal facilities accredited by the French Ministry of Agriculture for performing experiments on live

9

rodents. All animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice.

The isolate BetaCoV/France/IDF00372/2020 (EVAg

collection, Ref-SKU: 014V-03890) was kindly provided by Sylvie Van der Werf. Viral stocks were

13

produced on Vero-E6 cells infected at a multiplicity of infection of 1x10 PFU (plaque-forming units).

14

The virus was harvested 3 days post-infection, clarified and then aliquoted before storage at -80°C.

15

Viral stocks were titrated on Vero-E6 cells by classical plaque assays using semisolid overlays (Avicel,

2

hamsters were placed in another similar cage for 2 minutes when about 5 pieces of cereals were

3

hidden in 1.5 cm bedding in a corner of the test cage. The tested hamsters were then placed in the

4

opposite corner and the latency to find the food (defined as the time to locate cereals and start

5

digging) was recorded using a chronometer. The test was carried out during a 15 min period. As soon

6

as food was uncovered, hamsters were removed from the cage. One minute later, hamsters

7

performed the same test but with visible chocolate cereals, positioned upon the bedding. The tests

8

were realized in isolators in a Biosafety level-3 facility that were specially equipped for that.

At 4 dpi, animals were euthanized with an excess of anesthetics (ketamine and xylazine) and

Food finding assays were performed at 3 days post-infection. n=12/group (males CoV_saline and
