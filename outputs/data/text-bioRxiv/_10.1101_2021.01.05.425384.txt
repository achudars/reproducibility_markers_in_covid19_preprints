Abstract
Objective
The current pandemic has led to a proliferation of predictive models being developed to
address various aspects of COVID-19 patient care. We aimed to develop an online platform
that would serve as an open source repository for a curated subset of such models, and
provide a simple interface for included models to allow for online calculation. This platform
would support doctors during decision-making regarding diagnoses, prognoses, and follow-up
of COVID-19 patients, expediting the models’ transition from research to clinical practice.

Methods
In this proof-of-principle study, we performed a literature search in PubMed and WHO
database to find suitable models for implementation on our platform. All selected models
were publicly available (peer reviewed publications or open source repository) and had been
validated (TRIPOD type 3 or 2b). We created a method for obtaining the regression
coefficients if only the nomogram was available in the original publication. All predictive
models were transcribed on a practical graphical user interface using PHP 8.0.0, and
published online together with supporting documentation and links to the associated articles.

Results
The open source website https://covid19risk.ai/ currently incorporates nine models from six
different research groups, evaluated on datasets from different countries. The website will
continue to be populated with other models related to COVID-19 prediction as these become
available. This dynamic platform allows COVID-19 researchers to contact us to have their
model curated and included on our website, thereby increasing the reach and real-world
impact

of

their

work.

Conclusion
We have successfully demonstrated in this proof-of-principle study that our website provides
an inclusive platform for predictive models related to COVID-19. It enables doctors to
supplement their judgment with patient-specific predictions from externally-validated models
in a user-friendly format. Additionally, this platform supports researchers in showcasing their
work, which will increase the visibility and use of their models.

Keywords: Covid-19, predictive models, diagnosis, prognosis, nomogram, machine

Introduction
The recent COVID-19 pandemic, at its start, emphasized several key unmet needs in terms of
patient stratification using quantifiable metrics [1]. These include (a) identifying, in the
uninfected population, at-risk persons who should be subjected to stricter restrictions than the
general population [2], and (b) in the infected population, improving the detection of high-risk
patients by utilizing all available patient data (e.g., clinical, laboratory, genetic, and
radiological features) so as to improve quality of care and use of hospital resources [3][4].
Now, with several vaccines emerging, there is another compelling reason for identifying those
who are most at risk and should therefore receive the vaccines first [5–7].

Ideally, one should address the above needs using quantitative tools that (a) help people at
home decide (in consultation with their doctor) whether their health status warrants being selfquarantined, and whether their symptoms (if present) indicate the need for visiting the
hospital, and (b) help doctors during triage decide if a patient should be sent home,
hospitalized in a ward, or admitted to intensive care [8]. Quantifying these probabilities can
be done by using predictive machine learning models.
Currently, COVID-19 publications regarding such models are booming. There are numerous
studies being published, from multiple countries and all using different inclusion criteria and
outcome measures [4]. This heavily complicates the selection of the optimal model for a
specific patient [9]. In addition, the quality of the research is sometimes suboptimal, as a
recent review paper has shown [4].
We, as researchers working on COVID-19 models, saw an urgent need for a web-based
platform that would serve as an open source repository for validated models. Such a platform
would allow the user to have a quick overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the curated
models that passed our quality checks. The platform would also allow the user to calculate the
output of such models by simply providing the inputs in a user-friendly format, rather than
creating their own implementation or conducting their own search to find a suitable
implementation.
Our aim for this platform is to include validated prediction models (TRIPOD type 2b and 3)
[10], acquired from institutions all over the world, related to all aspects of the disease,
including risk assessment of being infected, triage at hospital admission, prediction of
recovery process during follow-up, and patient inclusion and stratification in clinical trials.
We aim to be inclusive, and thus models that are outside the scope of risk assessment and
patient stratification are still within the purview of the platform, e.g., diagnostic models. We

believe it will be of interest to doctors who want to leverage the results of all the great
research that is taking place, and it will also benefit researchers in dissemination of their own
work and in learning about the findings of other groups.
The proof-of-concept of such a platform forms the basis of this paper. We intend to maintain
this platform as a public service, and increase the number of curated models by encouraging
other researchers to share their work through our platform. The benefits to them include (a)
helping the researchers to generalize their models by allowing the models to be tested by
research groups that are different from the ones that created the model (TRIPOD 4), and (b)
improved visibility of their model, which should stimulate usage and citations[11].

Methods
We reviewed the PubMed database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) and the World Health Organization (WHO) database for COVID-19 publications
from December 2019 to June 2020. To find relevant publications to our focus we used the
terms in the search field: "COVID 2019 prognostic models", "novel coronavirus 2019
diagnostic tools", "COVID-19 predictive models", and "machine-learning COVID 19
models".
The steps that we followed from the literature search until the final stage of publishing online
are shown in Figure 1.

In order to assess the reporting quality of the models from the studies, we tested each paper
for its compliance to the TRIPOD (Transparent Reporting of studies on prediction models for
Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis) reporting guideline as shown in Figure 2 [10,12].
Figure 2-TRIPOD types classifications [10].

Getting model coefficients from a Nomogram
In order to improve readability and interpretability by medical specialists, regression models
are often published as nomograms, without the model coefficients. To publish the models in a
consistent manner on our platform, we used a simple method to extract the coefficients from
nomograms. This method is explained using an example taken from one of the implemented
models [3], and shown below in Figure 3.
The first step was to determine the relationship between the parameter and the nomogram
score, which was done by reading the nomogram, as shown in Table 1.

The relationship between the parameters and the nomogram score 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 is described by the
following equation:

𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 = 𝑥𝑥1 ∙ 9.32 + 𝑥𝑥2 ∙ 10 + 𝑥𝑥3 ∙ 8.82 + 𝑥𝑥4 ∙ 3.04 + 𝑥𝑥5 ∙ 2.10 + 𝑥𝑥6 ∙ 0.63

The next step is to determine the relationship between the nomogram score and the
probability through the regression equation. A logistic regression model follows the following
equation:
𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑔𝑔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖(𝑝𝑝) = 𝛽𝛽0 + � 𝛽𝛽𝑛𝑛 ∙ 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛
𝑛𝑛

The Logit of the probability and the nomogram score should have a linear relationship, from
which the slope was used to determine the value of the coefficients, and the intercept of the
model was extracted (Figure 4).
Figure 4 – Logit(P) plotted against the nomogram score

For this example the regression coefficients are shown in Table 2.

All the models are written in PHP 8.0.0, where for regression models we set the coefficients
and variables in the PHP syntax, thereby making the models operate identically. For the
frontend side we used languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript for some specific
functionalities. The backend of this platform is PHP based and the database is MySQL.

Results
We have created an open source website (https://covid19risk.ai/) to serve as an archive for
published AI prediction models related to all aspects of COVID-19, including diagnosis,
theragnosis (how to treat the patient, risk stratification), and follow-up (treatment response
and complication).
Currently there are nine models implemented and published as illustrated in Table 3. Every
showcased model includes a description of the methodology and clinical datasets used for
model development and validation, and limitations of each model are explicit.

The main result of our work is a broadly applicable platform, which includes validated models
regarding different stages, symptoms and outcomes of COVID-19. This repository of
COVID-19 predictive models will serve as a decision aid for doctors.

Discussion
This platform can be viewed as a “model zoo” aimed at researchers and clinicians and with
adequate grasp of the medical complexities associated with COVID-19. The aim for all
showcased models is to stimulate research and supplement clinical judgment, not substitute it.
The open source website is not intended for unaided use by laypeople (e.g., patients).
We re-emphasize that this manuscript and the website in its current form are only a proof-ofprinciple. We do not claim that all models that would pass our selection criteria have been
included. Similarly, any model not currently included on the platform should not be seen as
problematic. Our inclusion period ranged from December 2019 till June 2020. As many
models were published since then, an update of the search and the website needs to be and
will be done in the near future.
This paper should be seen by researchers from outside our collaboration as an invitation to
participate on this platform, with the option of keeping the code hidden from the end user
while still offering full functionality. We will assist external researchers for the successful
incorporation of their models on our platform. This will create synergies that are bound to
accelerate AI research on COVID-19. It will also ensure that models get the recognition they
deserve and are used widely, instead of gathering dust as often happens when there are many
publications on the same broad theme during a short period (a certainty in the context of
COVID-19, given its world-changing nature).

The method we used for retrieving coefficients of a regression model from a nomogram has
certain limitations. For one, the accuracy is highly dependent on the resolution of the
published model. Another limitation is that though the coefficients of the model are retrieved,
the standard error for the coefficients of the parameters cannot be obtained from a nomogram
alone. However, the method can be applied to any nomogram, making it a tool that can be
broadly used, not restricted to COVID-19.

Conclusions
Our platform (https://covid19risk.ai/), at the current proof-of-principle stage, includes nine
validated machine-learning models to serve as decision aids to doctors for various aspects of
COVID-19 patient care. Our method for obtaining regression coefficients from a nomogram
can be used by other researchers, including in non-COVID contexts. Our platform will be
maintained and regularly updated for at least three years, since we have secured funding for
this period (DRAGON grant). Therefore, we are encouraging research groups to collaborate
with us to share their models with the world.
