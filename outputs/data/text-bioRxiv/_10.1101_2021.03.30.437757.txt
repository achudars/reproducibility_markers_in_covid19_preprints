Abstract: The untranslated regions (UTRs) of viral genomes contain a variety of

23

conserved yet dynamic structures crucial for viral replication, providing drug targets for

24

the development of broad spectrum anti-virals. We combine in vitro RNA analysis with

25

Molecular Dynamics simulations to build the first 3D models of the structure and

26

dynamics of key regions of the 5’ UTR of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Furthermore, we

27

determine the binding of metallo-supramolecular helicates (cylinders) to this RNA

28

structure. These nano-size agents are uniquely able to thread through RNA junctions and

29

we identify their binding to a 3-base bulge and the central cross 4-way junction located

30

in the stem loop 5. Finally, we show these RNA-binding cylinders suppress SARS-CoV-2

31

replication, highlighting their potential as novel antiviral agents.

Introduction

44

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and as of 1st March 2021 there

45

have been 113,267,303 recorded cases and 2,520,550 deaths worldwide[1]. Emerging so

46

soon after other major coronavirus outbreaks (SARS, MERS), this global pandemic has

47

highlighted the need for greater preparedness to tackle newly emergent viruses that may

48

spread with lethal consequences. Fundamental understanding of viral processes needs to

49

be coupled to the development of a variety of broad-acting antiviral strategies to interfere

50

with these processes, in order to maximise the armory of drugs that we have available to

51

treat novel pathogens. To date, antiviral drug designs have largely targeted viral

52

proteins[2,3] especially those with enzymic functions such as proteases and

53

polymerases[4,5]. An alternative approach is to target viral nucleic acid structures that

54

are essential for replication. With current advances in sequencing technology, the

55

sequence of a new virus can be identified within the first weeks of an outbreak,

56

identifying both the protein coding regions and the untranslated regions (UTRs). The

57

role of the UTRs is not completely understood for many viral families their conserved

58

structures underline their functional importance. Where UTRs have been studied to

59

determine function (retrovirus HIV-1[6,7], flavivirus[8-11], to a lesser extent

60

coronavirus[12-14]) they have been shown to have dynamic structures essential for the

61

viral replication[15,16].

62

These non-coding RNA regions are highly structured with multiple stem loops, bulges,

63

crosses and pseudo-knots, with common structural elements seen in many viral UTRs.

64

These structures play a role in RNA-RNA interactions (both within the viral genome and

65

with host machinery) and in protein binding for the initiation of mRNA production,

66

translation and viral replication. Moreover, these RNA structures may act as trans acting

67

elements or mediate translational frameshifting, a common feature in viruses with plus-

68

strand RNA genomes.

69

Nucleic acid sensors mediate the early detection and host response to virus infections,

70

and recognise either viral nucleic acids or ‘unusual’ cellular nucleic acids present upon

71

infection[17]. Sensors from the RIG-I-Like Receptor (RLR) family are key pattern

72

recognition receptors for coronaviruses[18,19] which detect RNAs with specific

73

structures such as 5’-triphosphate or 5’-diphosphate ends[20,21]. Therefore UTR

74

structures within double-stranded viral RNA provide attractive drug targets, both for

75

direct inhibition of viral replication[13] and induction of host innate immune responses.

76

Compared to protein- and DNA-recognition, RNA-recognition by drugs has been much

77

less explored. Nucleic acid recognition often focuses on sequence recognition but for

78

RNA, which folds into complex shapes, its structure provides an opportunity for specific

79

targeting; indeed, it is the structure of the UTR that is conserved for function, rather than

80

sequence. Small molecule libraries have been screened for RNA binding (analogous to

81

protein drug screens)[22-24] and agents targeting RNA structures include small

82

molecules that hydrogen bond within the heart of trinucleotide DNA/RNA repeats[25],

83

and planar RNA quadruplex binders[26-31].

84

We have explored nano-size metallo-supramolecular cylinders (Fig.1A) as RNA-binding

85

agents[32]. They are larger than traditional small molecules, with extensive aromatic

86

surfaces to stack with the RNA bases (Fig. 1B) and cationic charge (4+) that ensure strong

87

binding and excellent shape-fit for RNA cavities. We have characterized the binding of

88

cylinders in an RNA 3-way junction[32] by crystallography (Fig. 1C) and showed

89

analogous binding in an RNA bulge structure[33,34]. Furthermore, we demonstrated

90

cylinder binding to an RNA 3-base bulge in the TAR region of the HIV-1 genome (located

91

in its UTR), that prevented HIV-1 replication[34].

92

Given this antiviral activity against HIV-1 we were interested to assess whether these

93

cylinders would bind structures in the 5’ UTR of SARS-CoV-2. We now report combined

94

modelling and biophysical approaches to define the 3D structures of the SARS-CoV-2 5’

95

UTR, and demonstrate cylinder binding to specific bulge structures in the 5’ UTR.

96

Furthermore, we show that cylinders inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in cells.

Results and discussion

99

To create a 3D dynamic model of the 5’ UTR from the published genome sequence[38]

100

(original Wuhan strain, NC_045512), our approach was to predict the secondary

101

structures in silico, obtain experimental evidence to verify these structures, and then

102

model the tertiary structure and its dynamic behavior, again with experimental

103

validation. RNA secondary structure prediction has improved dramatically over the last

104

decade, with free energy approximations and machine learning algorithms available

105

(adding to the attraction of the RNA as a rapid-response drug target). However, there are

106

significant

107

structures that occupy a small space in the energy landscape. We compared ~10 folding

108

prediction algorithms (see Supplementary Information) with many failing to cope well

109

with the large size of the SARS-CoV-2 5’ UTR. Three representative predictions are shown

110

in Figure 2. The free energy RNAfold[39] and Mxfold2[40] algorithms gave similar

111

predictions, both akin to the known UTR structures of related coronaviruses[16][41],

112

while the machine learning based VFold[42] gave a quite distinct structure.

challenges with longer RNA sequences that can yield multiple distinct

113

To experimentally probe the UTR, we used SHAPE, (Selective 2’-Hydroxyl Acylation

114

Analyzed by Primer Extension Sequencing) analysis where the 5’ UTR RNA sequence was

115

first folded in vitro and the open strand (non-duplex) RNA sites (e.g. single stranded,

116

bulges, hairpins) acylated with 1-methyl-7-nitroisatoic anhydride (1M7). These sites

117

were then identified through a reverse transcription reaction that generates DNA

118

fragments which end at the 1M7 tagged sites and were analysed by gel electrophoresis

119

(Fig 3A). Two primers (RT1 and RT2) conjugated with fluorescent IRDye700 were used

120

to cover the whole 5’ UTR sequence. RT1 mapped the UTR from position +1 to +140, and

121

RT2 the distal region of the UTR (+141 to +300). The results (summarized as a diagram

122

in Fig. 3B) demonstrate that the RNAfold/Mxfold predicted structures best represent that

123

formed in vitro. In particular, the long run of acylation around position G confirms that

124

the Vfold prediction does not adequately describe the experimental data. The additional

125

stem-loop (SL4) predicted by RNAfold but not Mxfold is acylated (region K) which

126

suggests that if such a stem loop forms it may be transient. Recent studies of the whole

127

RNA viral genome in cellulo by Miska[43] (COMRADES assay) and Pyle[44,45] (long

128

amplicons with SHAPE-MaP) show dynamic folding and interaction between the 5’ UTR

129

and 3’ UTR, but that these key stem-loop structures (SL1,2,3,5; depicted in Fig2) are

130

retained, affording further support and confidence that our in vitro findings are

131

physiologically relevant.

132

The extensive whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 affords the opportunity to

133

monitor the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) mutations in the 5’ UTR. We

134

examined the available sequences in the gisaid[46] that were deposited before 7 January

135

2021 that contained a complete 5’ UTR. Interestingly the positions of SNPs within the

136

UTR (Fig. 3C) often occur near the acylated positions in our SHAPE experiment (Fig. 3B,

137

S6), suggesting that positions where the nucleotide has greater flexibility and hence less

138

structural importance for the UTR are more likely to be substituted. Although not

139

corrected for frequency, it is interesting to note that around 60% (19/31) of the SNP sites

140

identified to date involve replacement with a U residue, with the largest subset (11/31)

141

being a C-U mutation (Fig. S6). As anticipated the mutations will not affect the key

142

structures of the 5’ UTR.

143

After identifying the distinct stems loops (SLn) that were conserved throughout the

144

results from the secondary structure prediction, we attempted the more challenging step

145

of creating a 3-dimensional representation of the structure. We focused on SL3 and SL5

146

as they have a variety of different structural features including bulges and loops.

147

Although the exact structure/function of SL5 is not yet determined (to our knowledge),

148

it contains the initiation codon and is similar to the SL5 of SARS-CoV-1[12,13], suggesting

149

a functional role. Understanding the tertiary structure and behaviour from the sequence,

150

is more complicated than predicting the secondary sequence since RNA is an inherently

151

flexible molecule and a single static conformation will not be sufficient to understand the

152

binding properties. Recent advances in molecular dynamics parameterization of RNA and

153

wider availability of high-performance computer facilities can provide new insights into

154

the dynamic structure of the RNA and show the key regions of flexibility - usually bulges

155

and junctions, where both the secondary and tertiary structure is highly dynamic. After

156

creating initial models using the short list of open-source software available, the

157

ROSETTA platform (FARFAR2)[41,47] gave a starting structure most consistent with the

158

SHAPE analysis (notably the SL5 junction point having nucleotide interactions rather

159

than being very open), so we explored the dynamics around this central structure.

160

We employed the recent RNA-force field developed by Mathews[48,49], which retains

161

NMR characteristics of RNA structures even in non-minimum starting conformations, and

7

162

coupled it with Markov state modeling[50] to analyse the conformational space accessed

163

across different simulations. We started with 3 independent 1 microsecond molecular

164

dynamics simulations of the SL5 alone, and then performed additional 1microsecond

165

simulations with both enantiomers of the cylinder (three runs of at least 1 microseconds

166

each; with parent cylinder and both enantiomers) to identify RNA regions that can be

167

recognised by the cylinder. The simulations total 9µs. Additionally, Markov state

168

modelling revealed micro states where the cylinder can be positioned within the RNA

169

helix in the bulge regions. We also performed simulations on the SL3, comprising overall

170

4µs.

171

Just as for the secondary structure predictions, the observations in the molecular

172

dynamics of SL5 were verified experimentally by the SHAPE results, and by using these

173

techniques in concert we gain a molecular level understanding of the three dimensional

174

structure and dynamic behaviour of the RNA (Fig. 3.C, E) and how the cylinders bind.

175

Considering the SL5 RNA in absence of cylinder, molecular dynamics reveal the following

176

features of the stem: (a) There is a bulge at G138-U140 which is highly flexible with a lot

177

of transient stacking between its bases (region W in Fig. 3.B). G138 base pairing with C10

178

elongates the bulge forcing U139-U141 to point outwards of the helical axis. This is seen

179

experimentally in SHAPE. This sharp twist of the backbone often creates a bend to the

180

stem. (b) There is a mismatch at C15 (halfway between regions L and W) however there

181

are many transient non-Watson- Crick base pairings between A14-A16 and C133 and

182

those nucleotides did not produce a SHAPE signal; i.e. there is no significant bulge or base

183

flipping outwards and the helix is contiguous (c) The next bulge (U21-U25; region L) is

184

different. Relative stability is provided by three G:C base pairs (G20 :C128 , C24:G126 ,

185

C26:G124), causing flagging out of A23 as seen on SHAPE (region M). (d) At the 4-way

186

junction (regions N, R) the base pairings (‘CUG’36-37 and ‘CAG’78-80) hold throughout

187

the simulation (3µs) creating an additional 7 nucleotide bulge on SL5a (G72-A79) where

188

on the opposite strand there are only C38 A39. Although C38 remains stacked to G37 and

189

transiently binds nucleotides of the opposite strand A39 lacks both strong stacking or

190

base pairing, therefore it can be seen on SHAPE. The junction is less open (i.e contains

191

more pairing) than the secondary structure prediction and this is reflected in the SHAPE

192

experiment where there is only limited acylation. (e) Higher up on the SL5a CG Watson-

193

Crick (WC) pairs create rigidity which stops on the U47, which stacks strongly on C46

194

allowing stable non WC base paring with U67 but leaves U48 randomly pairing U66 and

195

G66 (region O,Q). U48 and G66 are both identified by SHAPE. The stem closes with strong

196

CG pairings and a short loop (region P), whose bending exposes U91 and U96 and they

197

are identified by SHAPE. (f) On SL5b five CG pairs add rigidity allowing/stabilising non

198

WC pairings. However, between C86:G100 and G89:C98 (region S) there is an additional

199

base and as U87 and G99 strongly stack on the C86:G100 A88 is exposed and tagged by

200

SHAPE. On the loop (region T) stacking continues strongly up to U92 and G95 creating a

201

tight bend exposing U93. (g) The short SL5c is also stabilised by 2 CG pairs and all three

202

A residues are stacked together but point outwards of the stem (region U).

203

These combined simulation/experimental pictures of the RNA dynamics were then

204

complemented by analogous SHAPE experiments and MD simulations of the SL5 RNA in

205

the presence of the [Fe2L3]4+ cylinder (Fig. 4). Four batches of simulations were carried

206

out in the presence of cylinder; for each enantiomer of the cylinder and with the cylinders

207

positioned either away from the RNA or inside the bulges. Importantly, the MD

208

simulations locate the cylinder binding sites on SL5 at the same positions that are affected

209

experimentally in the SHAPE analysis, and not at the other areas of SL5 that are

210

unaffected in SHAPE.

As seen in free SL5, the bulges serve as dynamic hinges giving

211

flexibility to the surrounding stems. In the simulations where the cylinders started away

212

from the RNA, they quickly localized ON those hinges, reducing flexibility of the hinge

213

drastically (in regions W, L, N ,R). From studies with three base bulges (on HIV TAR) we

214

know that such hinges can open and from such a binding position the cylinder can

215

reorient and insert though this can take very long on the time scales of simulations[51];

216

we can model this by pre-positioning the cylinder at or close to this position. Once the

217

cylinder is in the SL5 bulge (Fig. 4A, cylinder D), the simulations show that the helical

218

structure of the surrounding stems is disturbed, opening up the stem nucleotides to

219

attack from 1M7, and this is confirmed experimentally in SHAPE leading to an increase in

220

the signal in these regions (around L and M and towards W, close to the RT primer).

221

In addition to the bulge as a site of binding, in the simulations the cylinder can also insert

222

into the cavity at the central cross (4 way junction) (Fig. 4A, cylinder A), protecting A193.

223

This cavity is larger than the 3-base bulge and thus although the binding site may not

224

offer as good a structural fit, it will be kinetically quite accessible. The binding also to this

225

site was confirmed experimentally by the disappearance of this SHAPE signal (A193, RNA

226

position N) at increased concentration of cylinder. At the loading of cylinder used in the

227

simulation, interaction with the stems containing regions U and T was not observed. The

228

SHAPE results suggest that these regions are also affected as the loading increases.

229

In SL3 there are no large bulges similar to that found in SL5, however mismatched pairs

230

create a distortion on the helical structure that can lead to exposure of nucleotides to

231

1M7. Specifically, molecular dynamics simulations (Fig. 5) on the free RNA (no cylinder)

232

revealed short lived pairings of different types from G96:C126 to A102:U120.

233

Furthermore, higher up the stem U104:A118 to G106:G115 is also a region of multiple

234

cross strand pairings. Equally important for understanding the SHAPE results is the

235

transient stacking between this stem’s nucleotides revealed in the 3D model.

236

In the presence of cylinders, we observed that the cylinder is attached to the stem loop

237

(Fig. 5C) in a stable manner, decreasing the flexibility of those residues and thus

238

protecting the loop nucleotides from acylation, where we saw a reduced signal in SHAPE

239

(Fig. 4B region I). Cylinders can also bind lower on the stem (region H/J) and this leads

240

to an enhancement of acylation as seen on the stem of SL5.

241

Alongside the SHAPE experiments with the [M2L3]4+ iron(II) cylinder (M=Fe), we also

242

compared the analogous nickel(II) and ruthenium(II) cylinders (M=Ni, Ru; Fig. 4B).

243

Changing the metal does not affect the overall cylinder structure or charge, and analogous

244

patterns/effects are seen in the SHAPE mapping confirming that they bind the RNA at the

245

same locations and it is the cylinder shape/charge that is responsible for the binding not

246

the choice of metal. High cylinder excess (two last conditions, 1.25 and 2.5 nmoles

247

corresponding to 25 and 50 cylinders per UTR) in most cases severely affected RNA

248

structures and so SHAPE bands become less well defined indicating more random RT

249

stops. In PCR experiments the [Ru2L3]4+ cylinder is stable to the heat cycles and can

250

inhibit polymerase amplification[52]; the reverse transcription efficiency seems similarly

251

affected at the highest concentrations of this cylinder. Some small gel shifts are also

252

observed at high cylinder loading, possibly suggesting some cylinder-binding to the DNA

253

transcript.

254

We also tested the effect of two substituted cylinders based on ligands L’ and L”, to

255

confirm the key binding area of the cylinder design (Fig. 4B). These cylinders bear

256

additional aryl rings at their ends while the central regions of the cylinder (which insert

257

into the junctions/bulges) are unchanged. Both show similar patterns in the SHAPE

258

analysis to the cylinders of ligand L, but while [Ni2L”3]4+ had very a similar impact on

259

folding, the isoquinoline cylinder [Ni2L’3]4+ caused some changes in the SHAPE pattern

260

even at the lowest cylinder concentrations. The results suggest that it may be possible to

261

modify the cylinder structure to modulate the affinity for the binding sites.

262

Having established that the cylinder can bind and modify the structure and reactivity of

263

the SARS-CoV-2 5’ UTR in vitro, we explored their potential to inhibit viral replication in

264

cellulo. Simian Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus England 2 (Wuhan strain;

265

identical 5’ UTR to reference sequence) in the presence or absence of the Ru and Ni

266

cylinders, [M2L3]4+ (M=Ru, Ni), and the frequency of cells expressing the viral encoded

dose responsive manner, with the ruthenium cylinder being more effective and reducing

269

the frequency of infected cells to <5% at the highest doses tested (75 µM). MTT cell

270

metabolic activity/viability assays confirmed that the cylinder is not cytotoxic in the

271

timeframe of these experiments (See Supplementary Information).

272

We have shown that by combining experimental SHAPE results with Molecular Dynamics

273

simulations we can create 3D models of the structure and dynamics of key individual

274

stems that make up the 5’ UTR of SARS-CoV-2 These stems contain a number of intriguing

275

structural motifs also found in the UTRs of other viruses, and which offer the possibility

276

of developing new antiviral agents that act against a broad spectrum of diseases. The

277

unique nucleic acid binding activity of the supramolecular cylinders is ideally suited to

278

target these types of structures and we show that the cylinders can bind non-covalently

279

to an RNA bulge in stem loop 5, as well as the central cross (4-way junction) of that loop.

280

The ability to bind at different crucial RNA structural sites that are essential for virus

281

replication limits the opportunity for the virus to mutate and to evade drug action. In line

with their RNA binding, these nanosized supramolecular helicates inhibit infection at

283

concentrations where they have negligible cellular toxicity.

284

These helicate cylinders are currently the only metallo-supramolecular architectures that

285

have been demonstrated to thread through RNA bulge and junction structures, but there

286

is a growing interest in metallo-supramolecular designs to bind nucleic acid

287

structures.[53, 54]

288

supramolecular architectures, and the cylinder designs in particular, merit further

289

exploration as antiviral agents.

The results herein suggest that nucleic acid binding metallo-

Figure 4. (A) View from two angles of a representative snapshot of a simulation of 4 cylinders on
the SL5 RNA, revealing the same interaction points as indicated experimentally by SHAPE.
Cylinder A is threaded through the central cross (4 way junction) with cylinder D threaded through
the 3-base bulge at W. Cylinder B is at position N and cylinder C at position L. (B) SARS-CoV-2
5’ UTR folding in the absence (lane 1) and at increasing concentrations (lanes 2-6) of five
different cylinders. Cylinders were incubated with the viral 5’ UTR (0.05nmoles) followed by
SHAPE (acylation, reverse transcription and electrophoresis). (C) Band intensity of lanes 1
(without cylinder) and 5 (with) of the [Fe2L3]4+ gel. (D) SARS-CoV-2 5’ UTR diagram showing the
RNA regions where the folding was affected by the presence of cylinder, as indicated by SHAPE.

Figure 5. (A) Snapshot of the dynamic three-dimensional structure of the SL3 RNA from MD
simulations together with a Leontis Westhoff diagram (B) highlighting the dynamic base-pairing
within the structure. (C) View of representative snapshots of simulations of cylinders on the SL3
RNA, showing binding at the stem loop and on the stem as also revealed by the SHAPE
analysis.

Figure 6. Effects of the [M2L3]4+ (M=Ru, Ni) cylinders on SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells.
Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=0.04) in the presence or absence of cylinders and
fixed at 48 hours post-infection and spike expression quantified by rabbit anti-spike monoclonal
antibody (CR3022) and mouse anti-rabbit Alexa 555 (green). Cell nuclei were visualised with
Hoechst 33342 (blue). Total cell numbers and percentage of Spike expressing cells were
enumerated by high content imaging at x10 magnification using a CellInsight CX5 high content
microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific). (A) Representative images of untreated or 75 µM [Ni2L3]4+
or [Ru2L3]4+ treated cells. (B) Data represents the mean from three independent experiments and
the error bars show standard deviations. Statistical analyses show Student’s t tests with Welch’s
correction compared to no cylinder (dotted line), * p = 0.0168 and ** p = 0.0037.
