Abstract

23

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic currently prevails worldwide. To understand the immunological signature of

24

SARS-CoV-2 infections and aid the search for treatments and vaccines, comprehensive characterization of

25

adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 is needed. We investigated the breadth and potency of

26

antibody-, and T-cell immune responses, in 203 recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who presented with

27

asymptomatic to severe infections. We report very broad serological profiles with cross-reactivity to other

28

human coronaviruses. Further, >99% had SARS-CoV-2 epitope specific antibodies, with SARS-CoV-2

29

neutralization and spike-ACE2 receptor interaction blocking observed in 95% of individuals. A significant

30

positive correlation between spike-ACE2 blocking antibody titers and neutralization potency was observed.

31

SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T-cell responses were clear and quantifiable in 90% of HLA-A2+ individuals.

32

The viral surface spike protein was identified as the dominant target for both neutralizing antibodies and CD8+

33

T cell responses. Overall, the majority of patients had robust adaptive immune responses, regardless of disease

34

severity.

Author summary

36

SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe and deadly infections. However, the immunological understanding of this viral

37

infection is limited. Currently, several vaccines are being developed to help limit transmission and prevent the

38

current pandemic. However, basic understanding of the adaptive immune response developed during SARS-

39

CoV-2 infections is needed to inform further vaccine development and to understand the protective properties

40

of the developed immune response. We investigated, the adaptive immune response developed during SARS-

41

CoV-2 infections in recovered patients experiencing a full spectrum of disease severity, from asymptomatic

42

infections to severe cases requiring hospitalization. We used a novel multiplex serological platform, cell-based

43

neutralization assays and dextramer flow cytometry assays to characterize a broad and robust humoral and

44

cellular immune response towards SARS-CoV-2. We found that the vast majority of recovered individuals

45

have clear detectable and functional SARS-CoV-2 spike specific adaptive immune responses, despite diverse

46

disease severities. The detection of both a humoral and cellular functional spike specific immune response in

47

the vast majority of the individuals, irrespective of asymptomatic manifestations, supports vaccine designs

Introduction

51

The year of 2020 has been thoroughly marked by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome

52

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)[1]. Originating in China December 2019, the outbreak was formally declared a

53

pandemic by the WHO in March 2020 [2]. With millions of cases confirmed across 200 countries, the virus

54

has claimed more than 1.4 million lives as of early December 2020 [3]. The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is an

55

ongoing health crisis, which is extensively affecting almost all aspects of the global human society. An

56

important aspect of SARS-CoV-2 replication is binding and infection of the host cell. The viral spike protein

57

receptor binding domain (RBD) interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), found on the cell

58

surface, thereby mediating viral infection [4, 5]. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms manifest

59

primarily as a respiratory disease, with emergent complications of several organs in cases of severe disease

60

[6]. While efforts are converging globally to develop an effective vaccine[7], our broader basic understanding

61

of the adaptive immune response towards SARS-CoV-2 is still limited.

62

Several studies have described the general adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2, showing that

63

SARS-CoV-2 specific B and T cells are generated during infections. First immunoglobulin (Ig) M and later

64

IgG SARS-CoV-2 spike specific antibodies are readily detected in COVID-19 patients [8-12]. Evaluations by

65

neutralization assays have confirmed the ability of the generated antibodies to prevent viral infections in vitro

66

[13-15]. The limited number of confirmed cases suffering reinfections post recovery [16-19], and high degree

67

of protective immunity against viral re-challenge shown in vivo in macaque challenge studies [20], suggest

68

that the immunological response developed during primary infections provide at least some protection against

69

reinfection. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell activation has also been documented in a range of

70

studies [21-23]. However, most studies have been limited to specific disease severity populations, and small

71

or none RT-PCR verified cohorts.

72

Currently, in depth characterization of the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a large cohort

73

representing the full disease spectrum, as well as the development of functional, and easily scalable, serological

74

assays, are needed to guide and support rapid further vaccine development. Here, we have delineated the

75

humoral and cellular immune responses in 203, RT-PCR verified, recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients. We

76

evaluated the quantity and potency of antibodies in each individual towards several different coronaviruses

77

and antigens, using both a SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus neutralization assay and a novel Mesoscale

78

Diagnostics (MSD) multiplex platform [24]. We further quantified the breadth and magnitude of single-epitope

79

SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T cells, using dextramer flow cytometry. Thus, we report an extensive panel of

80

adaptive immune parameters in the context of disease severity, to provide an outline of the general broad and

81

functional SARS-CoV-2 specific adaptive immune response observed across the full COVID-19 disease

82

spectrum.

83

Results

84

Patient enrollment

85

We studied the adaptive immune response towards SARS-CoV-2 among 203 patients who had recovered from

86

COVID-19. We have recently described the cohorts clinical characteristics thoroughly [25] a basic overview

87

of which is shown in table 1. The median age of individuals was 47 years (range: 21 – 79), and 45% were

88

female. The cohort was divided into three COVID-19 disease severity groups. 1: Home/outpatients with no

89

limitation of daily activities (8%), 2: Home/outpatients with a limitation of daily activities (75%), and 3:

90

Hospitalized patients (17%). The median duration of COVID-19 symptoms was 13 days (range: 0 – 68).

91

Enrollment occurred at least 14 days after the end of COVID-19 related symptoms, with a median of 31 (range:

92

14 – 61) days from time of recovery to study enrollment. To allow comparison of immunological outcomes

93

from SARS-CoV-2 infection recovered patients, samples from 10 healthy individuals enrolled in a study

94

conducted prior to the current COVID-19 pandemic were included as controls [26].

All individuals were assigned a COVID-19 severity group depending on their course of disease. Group 1

101

consisted of asymptomatic individuals with no limitations in their daily activities. Group 2 of moderately sick,

102

able to recover at home. Finally, group 3 comprises all hospitalized individuals, including those with/without

103

oxygen requirement and/or ICU admission.

104

Human coronavirus serology

105

First, we analyzed the presence of IgG antibodies towards multiple human coronaviruses in serum, using the

106

multiplex MSD platform. Compared to controls, we found significantly elevated levels of IgG antibodies in

107

spike RBD, spike N-terminal domain (NTD), and the nucleocapsid (p<0.0001, Fig 1A). Furthermore, IgG

108

antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals exhibited strongly increased reactivity towards spike

109

protein from other human beta coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS),

110

as compared to the controls. Further, increased IgG levels towards the seasonal beta coronavirus strains: HKU1

111

and OC43, compared to IgG from the control group were also observed (p<0.0001, Fig 1B). No difference was

112

detected in IgG levels to the negative bovine serum albumin (BSA) control between SARS-CoV-2 patients

113

and controls. Importantly, 202 out of the 203 individuals analyzed here, developed detectable antibodies,

114

otherwise absent in the historical controls, against both full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD antigens,

115

during SARS-CoV-2 infections. Likewise, robust production of IgA antibodies was also observed for nearly

116

all infected individuals, with SARS-CoV-2 spike specific IgA levels being significantly elevated compared to

117

controls in 201 of the 203 individuals (Fig 1C). Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels towards both spike and

118

nucleocapsid antigens, correlated positively with the disease severity. (Fig 1D+E). Overall, we conclude that

119

more than 99% of the SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in this cohort had readily detectable antibodies to

120

SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen, and that broad IgG immunological recognition of SARS-CoV-2 with cross-

121

reactivity to several different coronavirus develops during COVID-19. Additionally, the magnitude of spike-

122

targeting antibodies increases with disease severity.

123

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization

124

Next, we investigated the functional neutralization capacity of total plasma antibodies in vitro, using VSV

125

pseudotyped virus expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Antibody neutralizing potency was evaluated by

126

serial dilutions of plasma, yielding infectivity titration curves for each of the SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals

127

and the controls (Fig 2A). We found that 95.5% of the individuals (193 of 202) were able to neutralize SARS-

128

CoV-2 spike pseudoviruses and provided 100% inhibition at the lowest (1:25) plasma dilution. IC50 values

129

were extrapolated from the neutralization curves, and assigned to each individual as a measure of antibody

130

neutralization potency. Serum from the remaining nine individuals (4.5%) were unable to fully neutralize viral

131

infection, producing neutralization curves comparable to that of the uninfected controls. No legitimate IC50

132

value could be calculated for these individual, and consequently they were excluded from further analyses

133

using this parameter. Collectively, the IC50 values of all 193 neutralizing individuals span evenly across four

134

orders of magnitude (Fig 2B). In concurrence with the analysis in Fig 1D+E, we observed lower IC50 values

135

among individuals experiencing mild symptoms compared to those with moderate (p<0.001) or severe

136

COVID-19 (p<0.0001) (Fig 2C). We conclude that in this large cohort, with considerable diversity in disease

137

severity, the vast majority (>95 %) of SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to the production of effective neutralizing

138

antibodies, and that neutralization potency increases with disease severity.

139

Antibodies efficiently block ACE2 receptor binding

140

We continued the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 antibody functionality, using an MSD SARS-CoV Spike

141

– ACE2 competition assay (Fig 3A). This allowed us to measure the quantity of antibodies able to block the

142

interaction between the ACE2 receptor and SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and

143

SARS-CoV-1 spike protein. Many of the recovered individuals reached the assay’s upper limit of

144

quantification, and a clear increase in the quantities of serum ACE2 blocking antibodies was observed for all

145

three antigens compared to historic controls (p≤0.0001) (Fig 3B). The levels of antibodies blocking SARS-

146

CoV-2 Spike – ACE2 receptor interaction was increased in >99% of the individuals (202 of 203) compared to

147

uninfected controls. The individual antibody concentrations also correlated to the time from disease recovery

148

to inclusion (S1 Fig 1). Nevertheless, we found that those experiencing severe COVID-19 had significantly

149

greater levels of SARS-CoV-2 spike specific ACE2 blocking antibodies, compared to individuals with mild to

150

moderate disease (p<0.0001, Fig 3C). Both the pseudovirus cell-based neutralization assay and the SARS-

151

CoV Spike – ACE2 competition assay investigate the presence of functional antibodies towards SARS-CoV-

152

2. We identified a highly significant correlation between the IC50 values from the pseudovirus neutralization

153

assay and the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 spike specific antibodies capable of blocking ACE2 receptor

154

interaction (p>0.0001 Fig 3D). In conclusion, we observed that nearly all individuals produce antibodies that

155

target the spike protein-ACE2-receptor interaction and that the level of these antibodies was increased with

156

severe disease. Further, the virus neutralization capacity increased in conjunction with the amount of functional

157

ACE2 blocking antibody present in serum.

158

Collected serological analysis

159

Next, we constructed a heatmap compiling all humoral immunological data, to gain a cohort wide perspective

160

of the overall antibody response developed during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We ranked individuals according

161

to their antibody response potency from the pseudovirus neutralization assay (IC50 value), displaying their

162

respective immunological variables underneath (Fig 4). We observed, that the neutralization capacity was

163

clearly linked to the overall antibody levels present in the patients. Interestingly, it was further evident, that

164

the best (top 10%) neutralizers of the cohort displayed a corresponding increase in the overall breadth of their

165

antibody response, towards all the investigated coronavirus antigens. Importantly, strong pseudovirus

166

neutralization profiles were almost exclusively seen in individuals with antibodies that potently block spike-

167

ACE2 receptor interaction. We therefore conclude that the best neutralizers exhibit a broader variety of cross-

168

reactive antibodies and have greater levels of spike binding and receptor-blocking antibodies.

169

Epitope specific CD8+ T cell-responses

170

We then went on to explore the epitope specific T-cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals. We

171

analyzed the reactivity of CD8+ T cells from 106 HLA-A2+ individuals in the cohort for their specificity to

172

nine different SARS-CoV-2 epitopes using dextramer staining flow cytometry (Fig 5A). Overall, Membrane61-

173

70

174

recognized epitopes with positive responses detected in 17%, 25% and 81% of individuals, respectively (Fig

175

5B). Interestingly, these three epitopes originate from three separate SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Fig 5A). The

176

frequency of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T-cells was similar across all nine HLA-A2+ epitopes tested, with

177

the highest individual responses observed for N222-230 and S269-277 (epitopes 3 and 6) (Fig 5C). Only 10% of the

178

HLA-A2+ individuals (11 of 106) had no detectable response to any of the epitopes tested, while the remaining

179

90% responded to at least one, and up to seven, of the analyzed epitopes. (Fig 5D). We compared the

180

cumulative frequency of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T cells across the disease severity groups and observed

181

no significant difference (Fig 5E). However, we did observe significant albeit weak correlations between the

182

cumulative frequency of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T-cells and the majority of the serological

183

immunological parameters analyzed, including pseudovirus neutralization IC50 values as well as SARS-CoV-

184

2 specific antibody production and ACE2 blocking ability, as outlined with correlation coefficients in table 2.

185

The 11 individuals with no detectable CD8+ T-cell responses were evenly distributed among the disease

186

severity groups and displayed varying antibody neutralization capacity (S1 Fig 3). Based on this we were only

187

able to identify two individuals with both no detectable neutralizing antibodies and no detectable CD8+ T-cell

(M) (epitope 1), Nucleocapsid222-230 (N) (epitope 3), and Spike269-277 (S) (epitope 6) were the most commonly

188

responses. Thus, we conclude that 90% of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals mount a detectable CD8+ T cell

189

response, towards the nine epitopes tested, irrespectively of disease severity. We further conclude that the

190

broadest targeted epitope in this cohort is located in the spike protein. Lastly, there is an overall weak

191

but statistically significant correlation of antibody responses and CD8+ T-cell responses.

Discussion

204

We aimed to characterize the cellular and humoral adaptive immune response in a large cohort of RT-PCR

205

verified SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients, spanning a full spectrum of COVID-19 severity. Overall, our results

206

show that the majority of patients developed a robust and broad both humoral and cellular immune response

207

to SARS-CoV-2. However, our data may also help explain that some rare individuals have no detectable

208

immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2, and will therefore be at risk of re-infection as it has been reported

209

in a few case reports[16-19].

210

We were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in all but one of the 203 individuals investigated,

211

irrespectively of their disease severity and duration of symptoms. Antibody specificity was distributed across

212

several SARS-CoV-2 antigens, and with cross coronavirus serological activity observed against SARS-CoV-

213

1, MERS, HKU1, and OC43 human coronaviruses. We assume this reflects cross-reactivity of the antibodies

214

generated against SARS-CoV-2 for two reasons: First, due to the clear significant difference to the pre-

215

pandemic controls, and secondly because no cases of SARS-CoV-1 or MERS have been documented in

216

Denmark. We interpret this as an indication of extensive and broad immune recognition development in

217

COVID-19 patients. Similar to previous studies [14, 27], we confirmed the functionally neutralizing and ACE2

218

blocking capabilities of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD specific antibodies. Noticeably, this infers the

219

development of a robust humoral immune response within the vast majority of the COVID-19 recovered

220

population. Furthermore, nearly all individuals also have SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA responses, clearly

221

indicating a functional rigorous class switching and maturation. This presence of IgA is crucial for the

222

immunological protection at mucosal barriers, and hence protection against future SARS-CoV-2 exposures.

223

All serological and functional data collected show that both antibody levels and neutralization potency

224

correlate significantly with the disease severity. This indicates that severe disease manifestation is not caused

225

by a lack of adaptive immunity, which is in line with previous reports [28, 29]. Hence, we suggest that the

226

prolonged disease course, and consequent larger exposure to virus experienced in hospitalized patients, may

227

provide a timeframe in which enhanced antibody affinity maturation takes place, compared to shorter course

228

mild infections.

229

Studies are conflicted on the degree to which cross-reactive immunity between different coronavirus develop

230

during SARS-CoV-2 infections [11, 13, 14, 28, 30-33]. The considerable diversity of antigen recognition

231

independent of COVID-19 severity shown here, demonstrates that at least some immunological cross-

232

recognition of several different coronavirus is developed during SARS-CoV-2 infections. This is in line with

233

data on cross-reactivity in CD4+ T-cell epitopes between seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 [34]. The

234

cross-reactivity observed between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, may be due to conserved epitopes

235

between these viruses, as prior infections with SARS-CoV-1 or MERS within our cohort are highly unlikely.

236

Such potential cross-reactivity could arise through either newly generated SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies

237

reacting with conserved epitopes, or by reactivation of memory cells originally generated against seasonal

238

coronaviruses, followed by affinity maturation. Importantly, the multiplex serological analyses we performed

239

do not provide insight into the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response on a monoclonal antibody level. Here, further

240

studies are needed to determine possible protective and cross-reactive properties of single-antibody

241

specificities.

242

We functionally verified the antibody responses in all individuals, using two separate assays. The cell-based

243

pseudovirus neutralization assays are at present the standard method for determining SARS-CoV-2

244

neutralizing antibody potency. We additionally used the MSD novel coronavirus multiplex assay, recently

245

reported by Johnson et al [24] to determine the ACE2 blocking capability of individual serum antibodies. The

246

significant correlation between the two assay readouts identifies the plate format ACE2 competition assay as

247

a powerful, high-throughput, screening tool, with applications in both SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic neutralizing

248

antibody development, and assessments of functional protective antibody induction in vaccine studies. An

249

immense global effort is currently undertaken to develop effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the majority

of which are centered on inducing spike or RBD antigen specific immunity [35]. Here we demonstrate that

251

SARS-CoV-2 spike specific, ACE2 blocking antibodies are found in the majority of infected individuals. Their

252

extensive induction, even in short-term, asymptomatic infections, align with current vaccines designs inducing

253

protective immunity based on spike antigens [36, 37]. Nevertheless, the protective effect of antibodies elicited

254

during natural infections, remains to be determined.

255

We further report, with single-epitope resolution, a SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T-cell response in 90% of the

256

HLA-A2+ individuals analyzed. This corresponds well with other studies reporting CD8+ T cell activation in

257

70%–100% of recovered patients using full protein overlapping peptide stimulation [21, 38]. The location of

258

the top three immunogenic epitopes within separate proteins in the viral proteome additionally reinforces our

259

conclusion that a broad immune response is generated towards SARS-CoV-2 in the general infected

260

population. T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-1 is known to persist for up to six years, in contrast to B-cell

261

immunity [39, 40], underlining the importance of developing protective cell based immunity to SARS-CoV-2

262

if long term viral protection is to be reached. As an important point, the most broadly recognized CD8+ T-cell

263

epitope (S269-277) within our cohort (responses detected in 81% of HLA-A2+ individuals) is located in the spike

264

antigen. Thus, such epitope specificity can clearly be used to evaluate CD8+ T-cell immunity in spike focused

265

vaccine developments currently underway.

266

Surprisingly, we found that the cumulative CD8+ T-cell response, across all epitopes, did not vary by disease

267

severity in contrast to what we, and others [41], observed with antibody levels. While the limited coverage of

268

epitopes investigated here may influence this observation, recent evidence suggests that persistent viral

269

replication in otherwise recovered patients may be linked to CD8+ T-cell response magnitude [25]. Despite the

270

different observations with regard to immune responses and disease severity, we found overall significant

271

relationships between humoral and T-cell based immunity, but all of modest strength. A possible explanation

272

could be a synchronized waning of the magnitude of response for both immune parameters during the time

273

from recovery to study enrollment.

274

Of note, the use of dextramer staining is limited by inclusion of selected epitopes only, and conclusions are

275

consequently limited to the relative low epitope coverage. However, the advantages of the dextramer

276

technology are superior sensitivity and a high degree of specificity. In the light of the relative low proteome

277

coverage, the fact that only 10% of the investigated individuals did not have a detectable CD8+ T-cell response

278

clearly indicate a strong cytotoxic T-cell component in the immune response towards SARS-CoV-2.

279

Furthermore, as our observations of breadth and magnitude in relation to the distribution of distinct SARS-

280

CoV-2 antigens are similar to others [38, 41] we conclude that the panel of dextramers applied here provide a

281

new and sensitive representation of the general CD8+ T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 that will be an important

282

tool in assessing long-term immunity following primary infection or vaccination.

283

In conclusion, we observed that disease severity is closely related to the potency and breadth of the antibody

284

response towards SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we identified the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a target of

285

adaptive immunity in >99% of the cohort, irrespective of COVID-19 symptom manifestation. Only two

286

individuals (<2%) had neither antibodies with virus neutralization capacity, nor detectable CD8+ T-cell

287

responses. Hence, we conclude that regardless of COVID-19 severity, a robust adaptive immune response

288

towards SARS-CoV-2 is elicited during primary infections.

289

Materials and Methods

290

Study design and sample collection

291

Samples were collected from a cohort of 203 individuals who had recovered from COVID-19. Participants

292

were enrolled at Department of Infectious Diseases at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark from April 3rd to

293

May 29th 2020. Inclusion criteria were as follows; 1) Age above 18 years; 2) PCR verified SARS-CoV-2 within

294

the preceding 12 weeks; 3) Full recovery from acute COVID-19 illness; 4) Able to give informed consent.

295

Exclusion criteria were; 1) Ongoing febrile illness; 2) Immunosuppressive treatment and/or known

296

immunodeficiency; 3) Pregnancy. Samples were collected at least 14 days after recovery and a maximum of

297

12 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 PCR-verified diagnosis. One patient ID116 only had serum collected, and thus

298

is absent from IC50 and T-cell analyses.

299

Individuals were allocated to three groups according to the severity of COVID-19 illness, based on the criteria:

300

1) Home/outpatient, not experiencing any limitations in daily activities; 2) Home/outpatient, certain limitations

301

in daily activity level (fever, bedridden during illness); 3) All hospitalized patients, regardless of need for

302

supplemental oxygen treatment, or ICU admission with/without mechanical ventilation. Additional data

303

regarding demographic and clinical characteristics of this cohort has been reported elsewhere [25].

304

Serology

305

IgG antibodies were measured in serum samples using the MSD Coronavirus Plate 1 Cat. No. N05357A-1,

306

MesoScale Discovery, Rockville, Maryland), a solid phase multiplex immunoassay, with 10 pre-coated antigen

307

spots in a 96-well format, with an electro-chemiluminescence based detection system. The SARS-CoV-2

308

related antigens spotted were CoV-2 Spike, CoV-2 RBD, CoV-2 NTD, and CoV-2 nucleocapsid. The

309

remaining spots comprised antigens from other respiratory pathogens: Spike protein from SARS-CoV-1,

310

MERS coronavirus, and two seasonal coronaviruses OC43, HKU1. BSA served as negative control, as

311

previously described [24]. Unspecific antibody binding was blocked using MSD Blocker A (Cat. No. R93AA13

312

1). COVID-19 patient serum samples and control samples were diluted 1:4630 in MSD Diluent 100 (Cat. No.

313

R50AA-3). After sample incubation, bound IgG was detected by incubation with MSD SULFO-TAG Anti-

314

Human IgG Antibody and subsequently measured on a MESO QuickPlex SQ 120 Reader (Cat. No. AI0AA-

315

0) after addition of GOLD Read Buffer B (Cat. No. R60AM-2).

316

ACE2 Competition Assay

317

Spike and RBD targeting antibodies with the ability to compete with ACE2 binding were measured using the

318

MSD Coronavirus Plate 1. COVID-19 blocking antibody calibrator and 1:10 diluted patient and control serum

319

samples were incubated after plate blocking. SULFO-Tag conjugated ACE2 was added before washing,

320

allowing ACE2 to compete with antibody binding to spike and RBD antigens immobilized on the plate. Bound

321

ACE2 was detected as described for the serology assay above, and antibody concentrations were subsequently

322

calculated using the MSD Discovery Workbench software.

323

ELISA

324

IgA antibodies were measured using the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA ELISA from Euroimmun (Euroimmun

325

Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG, Lübeck, Germany, Cat. No. El 2606-9601 A), according to

326

manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, antibodies in serum samples diluted 1:200 were captured by recombinant

327

S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein immobilized in microplate wells. IgA type antibodies were detected

328

by incubation with peroxidase labelled anti-human IgA followed by a chromogen solution, resulting in color

329

development in positive wells. Signal was read at 450 nm with reference measurements at 650 nm, which were

330

used for background signal corrections. Results were analyzed relative to the ELISA kit calibrator, as a ratio

331

between sample absorbance and calibrator absorbance.

332

Cells and plasmids

333

All cell lines were incubated at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. BHK-G43, previously

334

described [42, 43], were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (DMEM), containing 5 % Fetal

335

Bovine Serum (FBS) and 50 U/mL Penicillin G/Streptomycin (P/S), where Zeocin (100µg/ml) and

336

Hygromycin (50µg/ml) were added at every fourth passage. Induction of VSV-G glycoprotein was performed

with 10-8M mifepristone. HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM, containing 10% FBS and 50 U/mL P/S.

338

Vero76 cmyc hTMPRSS2 [4] cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 U/mL P/S, and

339

10 μg/mL Blasticidin.

340

The construction of pCG1-SARS-2-Spike has been previously described [4, 44]. Briefly, SARS-2-S (NCBI

341

Ref.Seq: YP_009724390.1) coding sequence was PCR-amplified and cloned into the pCG1 expression vector

342

via BamHI and XbaI restriction sites.

343

Virus production

344

For generation of VSV*∆G(luc)-G particles BHK-G43 cells were seeded day 1 to reach a confluence of 70-

345

80% at day 2, where Mifepristone (10-8 M) was added to induce transcription of glycoprotein G. After 6 hours

346

the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 5% FBS, 50 U/mL P/S, and VSV*∆G(luc) at MOI =

347

0.3. After 1 hour of incubation at 37°C BHK-G43 cells were washed three times in PBS and fresh media was

348

added. Cells were incubated for 24 hours, after which the supernatant was centrifuged at 2000 xg for 10 min

349

at room temperature to pellet cellular debris, and stored at -80 °C.

350

VSV*∆G(luc)-SARS-2-S pseudovirus was produced by transfection with pCG1-SARS-2-S followed by

351

transduction with VSV*∆G(luc)-G. HEK293T cells were seeded in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 50 U/mL

352

P/S to reach 70-80% confluence the next day. 2 μg plasmid was used per 1 x 106 cells and incubated with PEI

353

(3:1) for 30 min at room temperature. The transfection mixture was added to the cells, and incubated for 18

354

hours at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS, transduced with VSV*(luc)+G at MOI = 2, and incubated

355

for 2 hours. The virus was removed by gently washing with PBS twice, and fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS

356

and 50 U/mL P/S was added. Cell supernatant was harvested after 24 hours, centrifuged at 2000 xg for 10 min

357

to eliminate cellular debris, and stored at -80 °C immediately. A VSV*∆G(luc)-mock was generated

358

simultaneously to allow subtraction of any remaining background from VSV*∆G(luc)-G signals.

359

Neutralization Assay

360

The SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacity of plasma was assessed through infection of Vero76 cmyc

361

hTMPRSS2 cells, with VSV*∆G(luc)-SARS-2-S pseudovirus particles. Neutralization was conducted as

follows: Plasma samples were thawed and heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 45 min. Subsequently, five-fold serial

363

dilution in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 50 U/mL P/S were made. 25 μL of each plasma dilution was

364

incubated with 50 μL VSV*∆G(luc)-SARS-2-S at MOI = 0.01 in duplicates, for 1 hour at 37 °C, in a flat

365

bottomed 96-well plate. Successively, 20,000 Vero76 cmyc hTMPRSS2 cells, in 50 μL DMEM containing

366

10% FBS and 50 U/mL P/S were added to each well, and incubated at 37 °C for 20 hours. Cells were prepared

367

for flow cytometry by gently removing the culture media, and washing once with PBS. Cell suspensions were

368

made by incubating each well with 75 μL Trypsin + 0.02% EDTA for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by

369

centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min at room temperature, and re-suspension in DMEM containing 10% FBS and

370

50 U/mL P/S. Cells were fixed in 1% PFA for at least 15 min at 4 °C, before eGFP expression was analyzed

371

using a Miltenyi Biotec MACSquant16 flow cytometer. The VSV*∆G(luc)-mock eGFP background signal

372

was subtracted from all samples.

373

HLA-A2 typing and dextramer staining by flow cytometry

374

For HLA-A2 typing cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed, stained at room temperature for 20 min with HLA-

375

A2 (clone BB7.2, Biolegend Cat. No. 343328) or matching isotype control (Biolegend Cat. No. 400356) and

376

acquired on a five-laser Fortessa flow cytometer. The dextramer stains were then performed on the HLA-A2
