Human (h) coronaviruses (CoVs) 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 are less virulent and cause
mild, self-limiting respiratory tract infections, while SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARSCoV-2, are more virulent and have caused severe outbreaks. The CoV envelope (E) protein,
an important contributor to the pathogenesis of severe hCoVs infections, may provide insight
into this disparate severity of the disease. Topology prediction programs and 3D modelling
software was used to predict and visualize structural aspects of the hCoV E protein related to
its functions. All seven hCoV E proteins largely adopted different topologies, with some
distinction between the more virulent and less virulent ones. The 3D models refined this
distinction, showing the PDZ-binding motif (PBM) of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARSCoV-2 to be more flexible than the PBM of hCoVs 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. We
speculate that the increased flexibility of the PBM may provide the more virulent hCoVs with
a greater degree of freedom, which can allow them to bind to different host proteins and can
contribute to a more severe form of the disease. This is the first paper to predict the
topologies and model 3D structures of all seven hCoVs E proteins, providing novel insights
for possible drug and/or vaccine development.

Of the seven human (h) coronaviruses (CoVs) identified, the recent three, severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and
SARS-CoV-2, are the most virulent and have caused severe outbreaks in the last two decades
(Broadbent, 2020; Hewings-Martin, 2020). The other four hCoVs, hCoV-229E, -NL63,
-OC43, and -HKU1, are less virulent and circulate continuously within the human population,
peaking seasonally in different countries all over the world (Aldridge, et al., 2020; Cui, et al.,
2011; Edridge, et al., 2020; Gaunt, et al., 2010; Killerby, et al., 2018; Lau, et al., 2006; Su, et
al., 2016; Zeng, et al., 2018). They generally cause less severe acute respiratory tract
infections, such as the common cold, in immunocompetent persons, but can become more
severe in immunocompromised persons, the elderly, and those with chronic, underlying
medical conditions (Killerby, et al., 2018; Liu, et al., 2020; Trombetta, et al., 2016). It is
unclear, though, why these four hCoVs generally cause less severe disease in
immunocompetent persons than the three more virulent hCoVs.

The disease severity and immunopathology of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections have
largely been attributed to the envelope (E) protein (DeDiego, et al., 2007; Fett, et al., 2013;
Jimenez-Guardeño, et al., 2014; Lamirande, et al., 2008; Nieto-Torres, et al., 2014; NietoTorres, et al., 2015; Regla-Nava, et al., 2015; Schoeman and Fielding, 2020; Xia, et al.,
2020). No research, however, has demonstrated whether this is also the case for MERS-CoV
infections. Despite the poor sequence identity of the E protein between the seven hCoVs,
certain functional aspects, such as its postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95)/Drosophila
disc large tumour suppressor (Dlg1)/zonula occludens-1 protein (zo-1) (PDZ)-binding motif
(PBM) and ion-channel (IC) activity, appear to remain conserved and have both been
implicated in the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
infections (Huang, et al., 2020; Nieto-Torres, et al., 2014; Nieto-Torres, et al., 2015;
Schoeman and Fielding, 2020; Teoh, et al., 2010; Wang, et al., 2020; Wolff, et al., 2020; Xia,
et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV E protein can interact with, among others, host cell proteins
syntenin and the protein associated with Caenorhabditis elegans lin-7 protein 1 (PALS1) in
the cytoplasm of host cells through its C-terminal PBM, highlighting the importance of its
topology (Jimenez-Guardeño, et al., 2014; Teoh, et al., 2010). Recently, a peptide mimicking
the PBM of SARS-CoV-2 E was also shown to be capable of interacting with PALS1 (Toto,
et al., 2020). Despite some experimental evidence, the topology of the hCoV E protein
remains largely under debate and data is limited to the prototypic SARS-CoV and to SARSCoV-2 (Arbely, et al., 2004; Duart, et al., 2020; Khattari, et al., 2006; Nieto-Torres, et al.,
2011; Yuan, et al., 2006). The topology of the E protein for the less virulent hCoVs, however,
is unknown with no evidence to suggest whether or not it adopts a topology similar to the
more virulent hCoVs. Similarly, the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the less virulent
hCoVs has not been experimentally resolved to date. To date, the only hCoV E protein
structure that has been resolved experimentally is that of SARS-CoV E for which two
templates, viz. 5x29 and 2mm4 are available, both spanning residues 8-65 of the protein (Li,
et al., 2014; Surya, et al., 2018). The SARS-CoV E protein also has other functions and is
involved in other host cell process based on its interaction with different host cell proteins
(Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). Given the various functions of E protein in the CoV life

cycle, it is suggested to be capable of adopting multiple topologies, depending on the
respective function (Kuo, et al., 2007).
The complexity and largely hydrophobic nature of membrane proteins, such as the CoV E
protein, presents a challenge in studying their structure and dynamics experimentally (Arbely,
et al., 2004; Latek, et al., 2019; Wu, et al., 2003). In the absence of experimental data,
bioinformatics software tools may provide useful answers in dissecting the topologies, which
can then be explored experimentally. Recently, Duart, et al. (2020) used the prediction
programs ΔG predictor, TMHMM, MEMSAT-SVM, TMpred, HMMTop, Phobius,
TOPCONS to predict the topology of SARS-CoV-2 E protein, and validated the topology
experimentally. The N-terminus of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein was oriented to the lumen of
the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) while the C-terminus
was located cytoplasmically – a topology that would enable the C-terminal PBM to interact
with host cell proteins in the cytoplasm. Since there is very little consensus on the topology
of the E protein of more virulent hCoVs and none for the less virulent hCoVs, this study aims
to employ the prediction programs used by Duart, et al. (2020) to predict the topology of the
E protein for all seven hCoVs. Defining the membrane topology of the less virulent hCoVs
can allude to whether they can interact with host cell proteins in a way similar to what the
more virulent hCoVs do. This may provide insight into understanding the mechanism behind
why hCoVs-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1 are less virulent than their more virulent and
recently emerging counterparts. It can also provide more insight into whether all hCoVs share
a similar mechanism of assembly and release (Ruch and Machamer, 2012). The 3D structural
models will provide insight into the pathogenicity of the virulent hCoVs by predicting the
secondary and tertiary structural fold of the E protein’s PBM and thereby, establishing a
structure-function relationship between the pathogenicity of the more virulent hCoVs vs the
less virulent forms of hCoVs.

The amino acid sequences for the E protein of all seven hCoVs were obtained from the
UniProt KB database (https://www.uniprot.org/) and only complete and “Reviewed”
sequences were selected. The topology of the E proteins was predicted using the prediction
programs ΔG Predictor (Hessa, et al., 2007) (http://dgpred.cbr.su.se/), TMHMM
(Sonnhammer, et al., 1998) (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/), MEMSAT-SVM
(Nugent and Jones, 2009) (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/), TMpred (Hofmann, 1993)
(https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/TMPRED_form.html), HMMTop (Tusnady and Simon,
1998; Tusnady and Simon, 2001) (http://www.enzim.hu/hmmtop/), Phobius (Käll, et al.,
2004) (http://phobius.sbc.su.se/), and TOPCONS (Tsirigos, et al., 2015) (http://topcons.net/).
For each program, the user-adjustable parameters were kept at their default settings.

Molecular modelling

Three-dimensional protein structures were constructed for all seven hCoV E proteins using
MODELLER software to compare the structural features between the more virulent and less
virulent forms (Eswar, et al., 2008; Sali and Blundell, 1993).

Two nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-resolved structures for SARS-CoV E (PDBID:
2mm4 and PDBID: 5x29) were obtained from the protein data bank (PDB) (Li, et al., 2014;
Surya, et al., 2018). These structures were used to generate full-length 3D models for SARSCoV (template: 5x29), SARS-CoV-2 (template: 5x29), MERS-CoV (template: 2mm4), and
hCoVs 229E (template: 5x29), NL63 (template: 229E protein model), OC43 (template:
5x29), and HKU1 (template: 229E protein model). The routinely used python script,
align2d.py, in MODELLER was used to perform an alignment prediction between each of the
hCoV E protein sequences and the respective template sequence (Eswar, et al., 2008; Sali and
Blundell, 1993). Thereafter, a 3D model was built for each hCoV E protein using the modelligand.py script (Eswar, et al., 2008; Sali and Blundell, 1993). As a validation step, we also
used the protein structure prediction server, ITASSER, to generate 3D structures for the
seven hCoV E proteins and compared the structures to the MODELLER predicted structures
(Zhang, 2008).

The phi and psi dihedral angle parameters for the Ramachandran plot was calculated for each
of the predicted protein models using PROCHECK webserver (Laskowski, et al., 1993). The
root mean square deviation analysis was done by performing structural alignment between
the predicted model structure and the homologous template protein. This was done to assess
if any structural deviation exists within the main chain atoms of the two protein structures.
The predicted structures were visualized using PyMol molecular graphics software (DeLano,
2002).

The output from each prediction program for the E protein of each hCoV can be found in the
supplementary information (Tables S1-S7). The predicted topology of the E protein for all
seven hCoVs exhibits little consensus, with only a marginal similarity within the more
virulent hCoVs and the less virulent hCoVs, respectively (Table 1). While some of the more
virulent and the less virulent hCoV E proteins have been predominantly predicted to possess
two transmembrane domains (TMDs), the majority of the E proteins were predicted to have
only one TMD.

Topology of virulent hCoV E proteins

158
159
160
161

Both SARS-CoV E and SARS-CoV-2 E were predicted to have one TMD with a lumenal Nterminus (Nlumen) and cytoplasmic C-terminus (Ccyto), while MERS-CoV E was predicted to
adopt a contrasting topology of either a Ncyto/Clumen with a single TMD, or a Nlumen/Clumen with
two TMDs, with an equal number of predictions for each topology (Table S3).

The predicted topologies of the less virulent hCoVs were almost equally as inconsistent as the
predicted topologies of the more virulent hCoVs. While hCoVs OC43 and HKU1
predominantly exhibited the same predicted topologies in having two TMDs and both
Nlumen/Clumen orientations, hCoVs 229E and NL63 did not share this topology, nor were the
respective topologies of the latter two similar. The hCoV-229E E protein was predominantly
predicted to adopt a Nlumen/Ccyto topology with a single TMD, while the hCoV-NL63 E
protein was predicted to exhibit a Ncyto/Clumen topology also with a single TMD (Table 1).

Despite the differences in the predicted number of TMDs for all seven hCoVs, the majority of
hCoVs were predicted to have only one TMD, the length and number of which is largely
consistent with reports for E in other CoVs (Lim and Liu, 2001; Liu, et al., 2007; NietoTorres, et al., 2011; Torres, et al., 2007; Torres, et al., 2005; Ye and Hogue, 2007; Yuan, et
al., 2006). The predicted Nlumen and Ccyto topology of both the SARS-CoV E and SARS-CoV2 E is consistent with what has been experimentally determined for the topology of untagged
SARS-CoV E and c-myc-tagged SARS-CoV-2 E (Duart, et al., 2020; Nieto-Torres, et al.,
2011). This similarity in topology is to be expected given the approximate 94% similarity in
E protein amino acid sequence (Grifoni, et al., 2020; Schoeman and Fielding, 2020).

Given the lack of experimental evidence for the topology of MERS-CoV E, the reason(s) for
and/or consequence(s) of these predicted topologies is not known. It may, however, provide
some insight into why the human-human transmission of MERS-CoV is less effective than
that of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Drosten, et al., 2014; Grijalva, et al., 2020; Wang, et
al., 2020; Wilson-Clark, et al., 2006). The topology of membrane proteins, such as the E
protein, plays an important part in their function, with certain functions, such as viral

assembly and release of virions, being dependent on protein topology (Ruch and Machamer,
2012; Seppälä, et al., 2010; White, et al., 2015). The exact role of the CoV E protein in the
assembly and release of newly formed virions was recently made clearer from the study of
the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) E protein (Westerbeck and Machamer, 2019). A lowmolecular-weight (LMW), likely monomeric, form of IBV E increased the lumenal pH of the
Golgi network employed by CoVs to assemble and egress from infected cells. This increased
Golgi pH likely protects the spike (S) protein from premature cleavage, preventing the release
of the trimer subunits prior to receptor binding. Interestingly, this disruption of the host
secretory pathway was mediated by the E protein independent of its ion-channel activity,
likely requiring interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of IBV E and a host protein capable
of altering the pH of the Golgi network. Without the C-terminus of IBV E exposed to the
cytoplasm, interaction with the necessary host protein would be unlikely and could result in
the production of impaired, possibly non-infectious virions (Corse and Machamer, 2000;
Westerbeck and Machamer, 2019). Neither of the predicted MERS-CoV E topologies reflects
a cytoplasmic C-terminus, suggesting that MERS-CoV E might likely not be capable of
interacting with a host protein in a way similar to IBV E to alter the host secretory pathway
for the effective release of infectious virions. If MERS-CoV E does, in fact, adopt either of
these topologies, it could explain why the virus is less effective at human-human
transmission. Interestingly, an early X-ray scattering study suggested that E adopts a helical
hairpin topology, whereas subsequent studies of solution NMR consistently demonstrated a
single-span topology in which E was bound to several detergent micelles (Arbely, et al.,
2004; Li, et al., 2014; Pervushin, et al., 2009; Surya, et al., 2018). This demonstrates the need
to be cautious about which technique is used to determine E topology and take into account
the environment to which E is exposed during the study. Nevertheless, the predicted
topologies may merely reflect the ability of the E protein to adopt multiple topologies to
perform specific functions (Kuo, et al., 2007; Westerbeck and Machamer, 2015; Westerbeck
and Machamer, 2019). The lack of experimental evidence also impedes the reason(s) for and
consequences of the predicted topologies.

The severe lack of experimental data on the E protein of the less virulent hCoVs makes it
especially difficult to validate both the accuracy of the predicted topologies and their
relevance. The requirement of the C-terminally located PBM of SARS-CoV E in the
cytoplasm has been well-established as crucial to its pathogenesis, while no distinct function
has been ascribed to the N-terminus (Castaño-Rodriguez, et al., 2018; Jimenez-Guardeño, et
al., 2014; Teoh, et al., 2010). Thus far, only one study has investigated a possible function of
the protein’s N-terminus whereby a chimeric SARS-CoV E protein was shown to contain
possible Golgi-targeting information in its N-terminus (Cohen, et al., 2011). It should,
however, be confirmed using the full-length protein as well.

A Nlumen/Ccyto topology enables the SARS-CoV E PBM to interact with host cell proteins
such as syntenin and PALS1. More recently, SARS-CoV-2 E has also been shown to interact
with PALS1 in a similar manner, very likely since it adopts the same topology as SARS-CoV
E (Duart, et al., 2020; Nieto-Torres, et al., 2011). If the C-terminus of SARS-CoV E was not
oriented towards the cytoplasm, it would not be able to interact with these host proteins.
Therefore, since the E proteins of the less virulent hCoVs NL63, OC43, and HKU1 were

predicted to have a lumenal C-terminus, it might not allow for interaction with the same host
proteins as SARS-CoV E; a feature that could likely explain why these hCoVs cause less
severe infections compared to SARS-CoV. The same, however, cannot be said for the
predicted topology of the less virulent hCoV-229E E protein. Despite sharing a topology
similar to SARS-CoV E and SARS-CoV-2 E, hCoV-229E is self-limiting and causes less
severe symptoms than the former two hCoVs (Lew, et al., 2003; Pappas, et al., 2008;
Poutanen, 2018). Nevertheless, given the various functions of E in the CoV life cycle, it has
also been proposed to assume multiple topologies, depending on the function (Nieto-Torres,
et al., 2011; Ruch and Machamer, 2012; Yuan, et al., 2006). Since only a small proportion of
the E protein produced during an infection is incorporated into CoV virions, it stands to
reason that one topology might be adopted to facilitate the assembly of new viral progeny,
while another is involved in the release through the secretory pathway (Westerbeck and
Machamer, 2019). This was attempted where the IBV E protein was produced to adopt either
a transmembrane topology, with one TMD or a membrane hairpin topology, containing two
TMDs (Ruch and Machamer, 2012).

Both SARS-CoV E and SARS-CoV-2 E shared a 91% sequence identity with the amino acid
sequence of template 5x29, suggesting high sequence homology (Figures S1A and S1B). This
is to be expected given the 94% sequence similarity between SARS-CoV E and SARS-CoV2 E, and since 5x29 spans residues 8-65 of the SARS-CoV E UniProt reference sequence
(P59637), which excludes the PBM (Grifoni, et al., 2020; Schoeman and Fielding, 2020). The
RMSD analysis showed a 0.698Å and 2.155Å difference between SARS-CoV E and SARSCoV-2 E and the template 5x29, respectively, suggesting very little structural deviation
between the respective two structures and the template. The RMSD analysis between MERSCoV E and the homologous template structure 2mm4 indicated 1.458Å difference also
suggesting a slight amount of structural deviation between the two structures. The 3D
structures predicted for the E proteins of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV,
therefore, successfully satisfied the Ramachandran plot dihedral angle distributions and,
based on the low RMSD values, the correct protein folds were assigned to the respective
protein sequences.

Despite the moderate sequence identity between the target sequence of the hCoV-229E E
protein and the 5x29 template, the protein model from this pairwise sequence alignment will
provide a medium accuracy protein model which is still useful for domain comparisons. The
RMSD analysis between hCoV-229E E and the homologous template structure 5x29
indicated a 1.776Å difference, suggesting very little deviation between the two structures.
The RMSD analysis between hCoV-NL63 E and the homologous template structure (229E
protein model) similarly indicated a 1.217Å difference, also suggesting very little deviation
between the generated model and the homologous template structure. Thus, the 3D structures
predicted for the E proteins of hCoVs 229E and NL63 successfully passed quality assessment
and based on the low RSMD values, the correct protein folds were assigned to the respective
protein sequences.

The RMSD analysis between hCoV-OC43 E and the homologous template structure 5x29
indicated 3.328Å difference, whereas the RMSD analysis between hCoV-HKU1 E and the

homologous template structure 229E indicated a 5.343Å difference, both of which suggest a
large deviation between the generated models and their respective homologous template
structures. Although the 3D structure predicted for the hCoV-HKU1 E protein satisfied the
Ramachandran quality check, a high RSMD value suggests the incorrect fold was assigned to
the protein sequence.

The E protein structures of the less virulent hCoVs OC43 and HKU1 predicted by
MODELLER had the lowest sequence identities and the highest RMSD values compared to
their templates. The high RMSD values are due to misorientations of the C-terminal domain
regions. This is a common limitation of homology modelling if sequence identity and
coverage are low in a specific region resulting in low accuracy protein models. However, the
ITASSER predicted protein models for OC43 and HKU1 displayed lower RMSD values
when aligned to template 2mm4, although the PBM was not conserved and displayed a
flexible coil region (Figures S3A and S3B). We are confident in the E protein models
predicted using MODELLER that display a less flexible PBM for the less virulent hCoVs.

The flexibility of the region in which the E protein PBM is located appears to distinguish the
more virulent hCoVs quite clearly from the less virulent hCoVs; the former containing a
PBM with a more flexible coil region, while the latter is characterised by a PBM that contains
a less flexible -helical turn. While so far only five interaction partners have been identified
for SARS-CoV E, more may yet be identified and those that have already been identified
have very different structures (Jimenez-Guardeño, et al., 2014; Nieto-Torres, et al., 2011;
Teoh, et al., 2010; Yang, et al., 2005). This could quite possibly be a pathogenic feature that
allows the more virulent hCoVs to interact with a wider range of host proteins which could
explain their increased pathogenicity and severity of the disease they cause. By comparison,
the less flexible -helical turn of the less virulent hCoV E protein PBM could very likely be
an impeding characteristic, preventing or limiting interaction with host proteins, which could
possibly explain the limited pathogenic capabilities of the less virulent hCoVs. Without
experimental data, however, this remains to be determined.

Clearly, much is still unknown about the topology of the hCoV E protein and how different
hCoVs can exhibit different topologies while still performing the same functions. However,
this is the first study, to predict and generate 3D models of the E protein for all seven hCoVs.
This study also attempted to determine a distinguishing feature between the E proteins of the
more virulent and the less virulent hCoVs to provide a possible explanation for the difference
in pathogenicity and disease severity. SARS-CoV is the only hCoV for which E protein
interaction partners have been identified. It, therefore, remains to be determined whether the
E protein of any of the less virulent hCoVs can also interact with host cell proteins similar to
SARS-CoV E, and, if so, which host cell proteins the less virulent hCoV’s E proteins can
interact with. As it stands, there is no experimental evidence on the topology of the E protein
for any of the less virulent hCoVs, leaving questions to be answered: can one protein adopt
multiple topologies, each one for a different function? If the E protein of less virulent hCoVs
exhibits a topology opposite to that of the more virulent hCoVs, can the less virulent hCoVs
still perform similar pathogenic functions like ion-channel activity and viral-host proteinprotein interactions with a PBM? Answers to such questions could further help to explain the

protein topology- and structure-function relationships as well.
