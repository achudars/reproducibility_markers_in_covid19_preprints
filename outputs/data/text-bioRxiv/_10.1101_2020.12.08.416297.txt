ABSTRACT
Background. To address the dire need for a safe and effective vaccine to protect individuals from
and reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, we developed a COVID-19 vaccine that elicits not only
robust humoral responses but also activates T cells. Our bivalent vaccine expresses both an
optimized viral spike (S) protein (S-Fusion) and the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein with an
Enhanced T-cell Stimulation Domain (N-ETSD) that directs N to the endo/lysosomal subcellular
compartment to enhance MHC class II responses. The vaccine antigens are delivered by the
second-generation adenovirus serotype 5 [E1-, E2b-, E3-] platform (hAd5) that has been safely
administered and found to be effective in generating tumor-specific T cells even in the presence
of pre-existing adenovirus immunity. Here, we report our findings on the safety and efficacy of
our hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD subcutaneous (SC) prime and thermally-stable oral boost vaccine
in generating SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies, eliciting N- and S-specific T-cell responses,
and providing complete protection with the clearing of virus after challenge in Non-Human
Primates (NHP). A key objective of the study was to explore the efficacy of a novel thermallystable oral hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD to serve as a booster dose following an SC prime.
Methods. Group 1 NHP received the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine on Days 0 and 14 by SC
injection (1011 VP), and on Day 28 by a single oral boost (1010 VP); Group 2 received vaccination
on the same schedule, but with an SC prime and two oral boosts. Group 3 placebo NHP were dosed
with vehicle-only SC-oral-oral. Blood for the isolation of sera and PBMCs was collected
throughout the study. ELISA was used for determination of anti-S IgG levels, cPassTM for presence
of neutralizing antibodies, and ELISpot for interferon-g (IFN-g) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) secretion
by T cells.

On Study Day 56, all NHP were challenged with intratracheal/intranasal 1 x106 TCID50/mL SARSCoV-2. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were collected on Day 42 pre-challenge and at
several time points post-challenge; nasal swabs were collected daily post-challenge. NHP were
euthanized on Study Day 70 and tissue collected for histopathological analyses. Viral load and
active viral replication were determined in BAL and nasal swab specimens by RT qPCR of
genomic and subgenomic RNA, respectively. Safety was determined by cage-side observations
such as weight as well as hematology and clinical chemistry analyses of blood.
Results. The hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine, both SC and oral, elicited no apparent toxicity
seen in clinical chemistry, hematology, or cage-side observations. Neutralizing antibodies were
induced in 9 of 10 vaccinated NHP and anti-S IgG positive titers in 10 out of 10. Th1 dominant Tcell responses were elicited by both S and N antigens, with responses being greater for N. Viral
replication was inhibited from Day 1 post-SARS-CoV-2 challenge with complete protection in all
(10/10) primates within 7 days of challenge from both nasal passages and lung. Replicating SARSCoV-2 dropped immediately and was undetectable as soon 3 days post-challenge. There was a
rapid decline in lymphocytes from the periphery on Day 1 post-challenge and a rebound within 3
days following challenge that was significantly higher by Day 14 post-challenge in Group 1 as
compared to Group 3 placebo NHP.
Conclusions. In the rhesus macaque NHP model, the bivalent hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD
subcutaneous and oral vaccine provided complete protection of nasal passages and lung against
SARS-CoV-2 challenge by eliciting neutralizing antibodies plus Th1 dominant N- and S-specific
T-cell responses. Inhibition of viral replication within the first 24 hours post-challenge, in
vaccinated NHP compared to placebo NHP, suggests the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific
cytotoxic T cells that rapidly cleared infected cells. The rapidity of clearance implies that shedding

of live viruses may be attenuated as a result of vaccination and thus the vaccine has the potential
to prevent transmission of virus by infected individuals. Clinical trials of hAd5 S-Fusion + NETSD are ongoing. The hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD subcutaneous prime/boost vaccine has
completed Phase 1 clinical trials and Phase 2/3 trials are actively recruiting. The thermally-stable
oral vaccine will enter Phase 1 trials as a prime and boost, as well as explored to provide a boost
to subcutaneous vaccination.

INTRODUCTION
To address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the face of the high efficiency
of SARS-CoV-2 transmission that puts vulnerable persons and front-line workers at risk (1-4), we
have developed a vaccine to protect individuals from and prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2
that elicits not only robust humoral responses but also activates T cells. This bivalent hAd5 SFusion + N-ETSD vaccine (5) expresses both an optimized viral spike (S) protein (S-Fusion) and
a nucleocapsid protein with an Enhanced T-cell Stimulation Domain (N-ETSD) that directs N to
the endo/lysosomal subcellular compartment (6) to enhance MHC class II responses. The vaccine
antigens are delivered by the second-generation adenovirus serotype 5 [E1-, E2b-, E3-] platform
(Fig. 1A) that is safe and effective even in the presence of pre-existing adenovirus immunity (7,
8).
We previously developed this attenuated hAd5 viral vector platform that can be used to rapidly
generate vaccines against multiple agents, allowing production of high numbers of doses in a
minimal time frame. The hAd5 platform has unique deletions in the early 1 (E1), early 2 (E2b) and
early 3 (E3) regions (hAd5 [E1-, E2b-, E3-]), which distinguishes it from other adenoviral vaccine
platform technologies under development (9, 10), and not only allows it to be effective in the
presence of pre-existing adenovirus immunity but has a very low risk of generating de novo vectordirected immunity. Genes encoding target antigens are cloned into the viral genome, which once
administered in vivo infect antigen presenting cells that express the inserted antigen gene and
induce immune responses to the pathogenic target. The platform induces both antibodies and cellmediated immunity (CMI). We have utilized this platform to produce vaccines against viral
antigens such as Influenza, HIV-1 and Lassa fever and COVID-19 (5, 11-15). In 2009, we
employed the hAd5 [E1-, E2b-, E3-] vector platform to express hemagglutinin (HA) and

neuraminidase (NA) genes from the H1N1 pandemic viruses (11). Inserts were consensus
sequences designed from viral isolate sequences and the vaccine was rapidly constructed and
produced. Vaccination induced H1N1 immune responses in mice, which afforded protection from
lethal virus challenge. In ferrets, vaccination protected from disease development and significantly
reduced viral titers in nasal washes. H1N1 CMI as well as antibody induction correlated with the
prevention of disease symptoms and reduction of viral replication (11).
The overwhelming majority of other SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development target only the S
antigen (Fig. 1B) and are expected to elicit SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses. In the
development of our vaccine, we have paid specific attention to the generation of T cells which is
predicted to enhance the breath and duration of the protective immune response against the two
antigens; the addition of N in particular affords a greater opportunity for T cell responses (16-18).
Importantly, we have previously shown that the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine elicits T helper
cell 1 (Th1) dominant antibody responses to both S and N as well as T-cell activation after
vaccination of a murine (CD1) pre-clinical animal model (5). We have also shown that the SARSCoV-2 antigens expressed by the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD construct are recognized by T cells
from previously SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals when expressed by autologous monocytederived dendritic cells (6). These studies provide evidence that vaccination with the hAd5 S-Fusion
+ N-ETSD vaccine (Fig. 1C) will re-capitulate natural infection that will then generate protective
antibodies and memory T cells. As described in Canete and Venuesa’s “COVID-19 makes B cells
forget, but T cells remember” (19), T cells provide protection even in the absence of antibody
responses. This is supported by Sekine et al. (18), who characterized T cell immunity in COVID19 convalescent patients, finding SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in most convalescent individuals
(including asymptomatic cases) with undetectable antibody responses (18).

Fig. 1 The hAd5 platform, SARS-CoV-2, spike, and the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine. (A)
The human adenovirus serotype 5 vaccine platform with E1, E2b, and E3 regions deleted (hAd5
[E1-, E2b-, E3-]) is shown. (B) The SARS-CoV-2 virus displays spike (S) protein as a trimer on
the viral surface. S protein comprises the N-terminal (NT), the S1 region including the Receptor
Binding Domain (RBD), the S2 and transmembrane (TM) regions, and the C-terminal (CT); other
function regions not labeled. (C) The bivalent vaccine comprises both S-Fusion and N-ETSD
under control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoters delivered by the hAd5 [E1-, E2b-, E3-]
platform.
A key objective of the NHP study design, described below, was to assess the efficacy of a
subcutaneous (SC) prime followed by a thermally-stable oral boost. An oral boost provides several
advantages in SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, including a greater potential for generating mucosal
immunity. SARS-CoV-2 is a mucosal virus and is only rarely detected in blood (20, 21), therefore
vaccines that specifically target mucosal immunity are of interest (22).
Compelling additional advantages of a thermally-stable oral boost are that it would likely
transform the global distribution of vaccines, especially in developing nations; potentially enable
patients to self-administer the boost(s) at home; and - because hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD induces
both humoral and CMI responses to both antigens – has the possibility of serving as a ‘universal’
heterologous booster vaccine to the multitude of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines under development.

Here, we report our findings from our NHP study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
novel second-generation hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine in rhesus macaques as well as the
efficacy of a thermal-stable oral boost.

METHODS
The study, formally titled “Evaluating the Efficacy of Novel SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines in the
NHP Model” (Study Number B05856) was performed at Battelle Biomedical Research Center
(West Jefferson, Ohio) and was sponsored by the Biomedical Advanced Research & Development
Authority (BARDA), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR),
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the National Institutes of Health/National
Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH/NIAID) (Washington, DC). This was a nonGLP study.
Dosing and sample collection
In our study design, we compared two SC injections administered in the center of the back
just caudal to the scapular region of 1 x 1011 viral particles (VP) on Days 0 and 14 followed by an
oral capsule delivered via a feeding tube after a minimum of 4 hours of fasting of 1 x 1010 infectious
units (IU) on Day 28 (Group 1) to one prime SC injection and two oral boost doses with the same
dosages and timing (Group 2), as shown in Figure 2.
Active vaccination groups comprised 5 male (3) and female (2) randomized NHP, and the
placebo Group 3 NHP, one male and one female.
On Day 42, NHP were transferred to a BSL-3 facility and on Day 56 they were challenged
with SARS-CoV-2 1 x106 TCID50/mL delivered to anesthetized animals both intratracheally and
intranasally. Nasal swabs (buccal swabs, nasal washes, oropharyngeal swabs) were taken daily

after challenge, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed every other day until the end
of the study of Day 70.

Fig. 2 NHP study design. Group 1 NHP (n = 5) were vaccinated by subcutaneous (SC) injection
of 1 x 1011 VP on Days 0 and 14, and received an oral boost of 1 x 1010 IU on Day 28. Group 2
NHP (n = 5) were vaccinated similarly, but both boosts were oral. Sera were collected as indicated
(blue arrows). On Day 42, NHP were transferred to a BSL-3 facility for viral challenge with 1x106
TCID50 VP of SARS-CoV-2 intranasally/intratracheally. Nasal swab (yellow arrows) and
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples (red arrows) were collected as indicated. Animals were
euthanized on Day 70 and tissues collected for pathological analyses.
Assessment of safety, determination of immune responses, and quantification of post-challenge
viral load and replication
Methods for safety assessments, including cage-side observations, animal weights,
hematology and clinical chemistry; and efficacy assessments including ELISA for anti-S IgG, viral
neutralization in cPassTM, T-cell responses by ELISpot during the pre-challenge, and RT qPCR of
viral genomic and subgenomic RNA for determination of viral load and viral replication in the
post-SARS-CoV-2 challenge period are detailed in Supplementary Methods.

RESULTS
Safety
The hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine was found to be safe
NHP that received the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD in either Group 1 or 2 showed no signs of
toxicity as assessed by cage-side observations and recorded weight (Supplementary Fig. S1). No
serious adverse events or animal deaths occurred prior to the pre-determined necropsy date.
Hematological findings (Supplementary Table S1) and clinical chemistry analyses
(Supplementary Table S2) are reported in the Supplementary Results.

Immunological Responses to Vaccination
The immunological responses including generation of anti-S IgG, SARS-CoV-2
neutralization, and T-cell activation for Groups 1 and 2 are presented below.
Group 1 NHP produced neutralizing, anti-spike antibodies
All Group 1 (SC, SC, Oral) S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccinated NHP produced anti-S antibodies
(Fig. 3A), with levels increasing from Day 0 to Day 42. Anti-S IgG (geometric mean, Fig. 3B)
climbed steadily following prime-boost with a peak at Day 42. Sera from all five NHP in Group 1
demonstrated inhibition of S receptor binding domain (RBD) binding to angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) in cPassTM (23), reflecting the ability to neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Fig.
3C). Anti-S IgG levels correlated with inhibition in cPassTM (R2 = 0.5166) as shown in Figure 3D.

Fig. 3 Humoral responses in Group 1. (A) Anti-spike IgG levels in individual NHP and the (B)
geometric mean of Group 1 and Group 3 NHP are shown. The results from (C) cPassTM for
individual NHP and (D) the correlation of those results to anti-spike IgG levels are shown; p <
0.0001 and R2 = 0.5166.
Th1 dominant S- and N-specific T cells were activated following vaccination in Group 1 NHP
As shown in Figure 4A, PBMC-derived T cells secreted IFN-g in response to pulsing by either
spike (S1 plus S2) and nucleocapsid (N) peptide pools, with responses being greater on Days 14
and 35 to the N antigen. Conversely, the number of IL-4-secreting T cells in response to either S
or N peptide pools was very low (Fig. 4B). The IFN-g/Il-4 ratio demonstrates Th1 dominance, with
some ratios being ‘infinity’ due to IL-4 being below the level of detection in some cases.

circles. Cells pulsed with PMA-ionomycin were used as positive controls as described in Methods
(Supplementary Materials) but those data are not graphed here. Data graphed with mean and SEM.
Group 2 NHP (single SC prime with oral boost) produced neutralizing, anti-spike antibodies
All Group 2 (SC, Oral, Oral) S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccinated NHP produced anti-S IgG that
increased with time, as shown for individual NHP (Fig. 5A) and reflected by the geometric mean
(Fig. 5B). Sera from 4 of 5 NHP in Group 2 demonstrated inhibition in cPassTM (Fig. 5C) and antiS IgG levels correlated with inhibition (R2 = 0.4242) (Fig. 5D). As will be noted later in results of
viral clearance, the NHP not showing inhibition in cPassTM nonetheless successfully cleared the
virus from nasal and lung passages to undetectable levels, implying a role for T cells and/or the
existence of non-neutralizing antibodies.

0.0001 and R2 = 0.4242.
Th1 dominant S- and N-specific T cells were activated following vaccination in Group 2 NHP
T-cell responses for Group 2 NHP were very similar to those for Group 1 NHP, increasing
with time and being greater for N. Overall, Group 2 T-cell responses were higher than those in
Group 1 (Fig. 6A) and peaked at Days 14 and 35. T-cell responses were also Th1 dominant, with
IL-4 secretion being very low (Fig. 6B and C).

Immunological Responses Post-Challenge
Lymphocytes decreased in the periphery immediately post-challenge, then rebounded in
vaccinated NHP
On Day 56 of the study (or challenge Day 0), NHP were challenged with SARS-CoV-2
infection. Peripheral lymphocyte levels were determined in blood samples drawn just before
challenge on challenge Day 0 and on Days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14 post-challenge. On the Day of

challenge, the lymphocyte level was similar amongst groups (Supplementary Fig. S2). To compare
the changes in lymphocytes as a result of challenge, the difference between lymphocyte values at
Day 0 and subsequent post-challenge days for each individual NHP was calculated, and the delta
values for each group graphed for each day. As seen in Figure 7, on Day 1 (24 hours after initiation
of infection) peripheral lymphocyte levels dropped dramatically in all groups, suggesting potential
lymphocyte recruitment to the site of SARS-CoV-2 infection – the nose and lung (24, 25). By Day
3 post-challenge, lymphocytes in all groups had increased and continued to increase up to Day 14
for Group 1 (Fig. 7A) and to a plateau in Group 2 by Day 7 (Fig. 7B).
On Day 14 post-challenge, lymphocyte levels were significantly higher (p = 0.0404) for hAd5
S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccinated Group 1 NHP compared to Group 3 placebo control NHP (Fig.
7A) and were higher in Group 2 versus Group 3, but not significantly (Fig. 7B). The relatively
greater rebound of lymphocytes in vaccinated NHP could be due to proliferation of a subset of T
lymphocytes in response to SARS-CoV-2-specific infection (16, 26, 27), a hypothesis that awaits
confirmation.

Fig. 7 Peripheral lymphocyte levels post-SARS-CoV-2 challenge. (A) Lymphocyte levels for
Groups 1 and 3 post-challenge calculated as the difference from Day 0 for each NHP. On Day 14,
the difference between Group 1 and Group 3 was significant (p = 0.0404). (B) Lymphocyte levels
for Groups 2 and 3. On Days 3 and 5, differences between Group 2 and Group 3 placebo were
significant, p = 0.0252 and p = 0.0141, respectively. The value of ‘0’ (no change) was used for
each NHP on Day 0. Statistical analyses performed using a two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test.

Protective Immunity Following Viral Challenge
Following SARS-CoV-2 challenge, viral replication was immediately inhibited from Day 1
post-challenge in both nasal passages and lung with no further growth and complete clearance
within 7 days of challenge in all (10/10) animals. Replicating SARS-CoV-2 was undetectable as
early as 3 days post-challenge in some NHP. This represents complete protection of nasal passages
and lung against viral challenge afforded by antibody plus Th1 dominant N- and S-specific T-cell
responses in both Group 1 and 2 primates receiving SC prime and thermally-stable oral boost
vaccination.
Group 1 nasal passages: complete clearance of replicating, infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus in
nasal passages following hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccination in Group 1
To determine the viral load, RT-qPCR analysis of genomic RNA was performed on nasal
swab samples. Vaccination of Group 1 NHP reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the nasal swab
samples as compared to placebo control NHP from Day 1 (Fig. 8A and B). The viral load in Group
1 vaccinated NHP continued to diminish to very low or undetectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 in all
vaccinated animals. Placebo controls had moderate to high levels (range 2E+09 – 8.4E+03 gene
copies/mL) of SARS-CoV-2 present in nasal swab samples for the duration of the study.
Replicating virus in nasal swab samples was determined by RT qPCR of sgRNA, as shown in
Figure 8C and D. The dynamics of viral replication inhibition were rapid, with a 2 log reduction
of viral replication by Day 2, with no further replication of challenge inoculum, and a reduction to
below the level of detection in 4 of 5 NHP by Day 5 post-challenge. By Day 7, replicating virus in
all primates was below the level of detection in nasal passages, demonstrating complete protection
conferred by the vaccine.

level are highlighted in yellow.
Group 1 lung: complete clearance of replicating, infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus in lung
following hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccination in Group 1
Viral load and replicating virus in BAL samples from Group 1 NHP were both ~2 logs lower
than in placebo Group 3 NHP starting on Day 1 after challenge with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 9B and
D), and levels of replicating virus were below the level of detection in in all Group 1 NHP by Day
7 post-challenge (Fig. 9C).

Similar to Group 1 NHP that received two SC doses and one oral boost, Group 2 NHP
receiving one SC and two oral boosts showed both a reduction in viral load and replicating virus
in nasal passages (Fig. 10A-D). Strikingly, replicating virus levels in nasal passages of Group 2
NHP were all below the level of detection by Day 5 post-SARS-CoV-2 challenge. (Fig. 10C)

As with Group 1, Group 2 NHP had >1 log lower viral load (Fig, 11A and B) and replicating
virus in lung (Fig, 11C and D) even on Day 1 post-challenge. By Day 7, replicating virus in all
Group 2 NHP was below the level of detection (Fig. 11C).

DISCUSSION
We designed our hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine with the objective of generating vigorous
T-cell responses so that the immune protection provided would be both broad and durable. Our
vaccine is distinguished from other vaccines in development by (i) the inclusion of N, a SARSCoV-2 antigen known to be highly effective in eliciting T cell responses (16-18); (ii) the use of an
hAd5 [E1-, E2b-, E3-] platform that is effective even in the presence of existing adenoviral

immunity; (iii) the modification of N to target it to the endo/lysosomal pathway to maximize CD4+
T-cell responses (6); and (iv) the development of a thermally-stable oral formulation to overcome
cold-chain limitations.
In the rhesus macaque NHP model, this bivalent hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD subcutaneous and
oral vaccine provided complete protection of nasal and lung airways against SARS-CoV-2
challenge by eliciting neutralizing antibodies plus Th1 dominant N- and S-specific T-cell
responses. Following SARS-CoV-2 challenge, viral replication was immediately inhibited by Day
one post-challenge in both nasal passages and lung with no further growth and complete clearance
within 7 days of challenge in all (10/10) animals. The immediate inhibition of viral replication by
Day 1 post-challenge in vaccinated NHP compared to placebo suggests the presence of SARSCoV-2-specific cytotoxic T cells that rapidly cleared infected cells. This rapid viral clearance by
the vaccine that confers comprehensive B- and T-cell immunity also implies that shedding of live
viruses may be attenuated as a result of vaccination with hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD, pointing to
its potential to reduce transmission of virus by already infected individuals.
The striking, immediate inhibition of viral replication by the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD
vaccination is in contrast to the reported findings for other adenovirus-vectored S-only vaccine
NHP studies (9, 10), wherein there was evidence of continued viral replication. Even when
challenged with a high titer of 1 x106 TCID50/mL, vaccinated animals in our study appeared to be
protected from the earliest time point assessed. On Day 1, this rapid protection and clearance was
particularly evident in the lung, where both viral load and viral replication were ~1-2 logs lower
than placebo in both vaccinated groups.

These findings present the intriguing possibility that the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine
may be useful not only as a prophylactic to prevent infection and disease, but also as a therapeutic
for individuals already infected. This hypothesis remains to be tested in ongoing clinical trials.
Our data demonstrate that all NHP immunized with the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine
generated anti-S IgG and that 9 of 10 showed inhibition in cPassTM and thus the presence of antiS RBD neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Of interest, the one macaque that did not show inhibition
in cPassTM still demonstrated complete control of viral replication in the nasal passage 4 days postchallenge and clearance in the BAL one week post-challenge. Although cellular correlates of
immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 have not been fully elucidated, this single finding of viral
clearance in the absence of high levels of neutralizing antibodies suggests the presence of other
vaccine-generated SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies or T cells that may have controlled the
infection in the absence of anti-S RBD nAbs. This possibility is consistent with the findings of the
critical role of T cells in protection from infection (19) in COVID-19 convalescent patients where
SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells were identified even in the absence of antibody responses (18).
Further characterization of the vaccine-elicited cellular and antibody responses is needed to fully
understand the role of each immune compartment in reduction of viral load and attenuation of viral
replication.
The generation of humoral and CMI responses that conferred protection of the respiratory tract
from viral challenge indicate the efficacy of the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine when delivered
by an SC prime followed by thermal-stable oral capsule boosts and reveal the potential for this
vaccine to be developed for global distribution. The oral hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD would not
require ultra-cold refrigeration like many COVID vaccines currently under review for approval or
in Phase 3 studies. Dependence on the cold-chain for distribution to geographically remote or

under-developed areas causes shipping and storage challenges and will likely reduce the
accessibility of the soon-to-be distributed COVID-19 vaccines. The possibility of the thermallystable oral hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine to act as a boost to other previously administered
vaccines (a universal boost) warrants further exploration. The hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD
subcutaneous prime/boost vaccine has completed Phase 1 clinical trials and Phase 2/3 trials are
actively recruiting. The thermally-stable oral vaccine will enter Phase 1 trials as a prime and boost,
as well as explored to provide a boost to subcutaneous hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccination.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL
Methods
Safety assessments
NHP in all groups were observed twice daily from study Day -7 until the end of the study on
Day 70 for clinical signs, including but not limited to anorexia (weights were taken), hunched
posture, lethargy, respiratory distress, activity (recumbent, weak, or unresponsive), convulsions,
and other abnormal clinical observations. Blood was collected from a femoral artery or vein,
saphenous vein, or appropriate vessel of anesthetized animals at baseline, and Days 14, 21, 28, 35,
42, 56 (challenge Day), 57, 59, 61, 63, and 70 (End Study). Collected blood was used for clinical
chemistry and hematological analyses as well as isolation of PBMCs.
Statistical analysis
For comparison of animals in groups, One-Way ANOVA was used with an appropriate posthoc analysis (for example, Tukey’s or Dunnett’s) for specific comparisons. For head-to-head
analyses, a two-tailed unpaired Student’s T-test was used. For all statistical analyses, *p <= 0.05,
**p < 0.01, ***p<0.001, and ****p<0.0001. All statistical analysis was performed using
GraphPad Prism 9 software.
ELISA for anti-Spike IgG
IgG against recombinant spike protein in NHP sera or plasma was determined using an
Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) wherein 96 well EIA/RIA plates (ThermoFisher,
Cat# 07-200-642) were coated with 50 µL/well by a 1 µg/mL solution of purified recombinant
SARS-CoV-2-derived Spike protein (S-Fusion; ImmunityBio, Inc.) suspended in coating buffer
(0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate, pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed three
times with 150 µL of TPBS solution (PBS + 0.05%Tween 20) then 100 µL/well of blocking
solution (2% non-fat milk in TPBS) was added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature (RT).
Plasma and serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 1 hour before use and 1:50 dilutions
were prepared in 1% non-fat milk in TPBS. Plates were washed as described above and 50 µL/well
of each dilution was added to the plate and incubated at RT for 1 hour. Plates were washed three
times with 200 µL of TPBS before addition of 50µL/well of a 1:6000 dilution of HRP-conjugated,
cross-absorbed goat anti-monkey IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (ThermoFisher, Cat# PA184631) in 1% non-fat milk/TPBS and incubation for 1 hour at RT.
Plates were then washed three times with 200 µL of TPBS and 50 µL of 3,3’,5,5’tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (VWR, Cat# 100359-156) was added to each well and
incubated at RT for 10 minutes. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 µL/well of 1N sulfuric
acid (H2SO4). The optical density (OD) at 450 nm was measured using a Synergy 2 plate reader
(BioTek Instruments, Inc) and data is analyzed using Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, LLC).
cPassTM for determination of the presence of neutralizing antibodies
The presence of neutralizing, anti-spike antibodies in sera from all NHP was determined by
assay of sera collected on Days 0, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 using the surrogate virus neutralization
assay, cPassTM (23). The assay is based on assessment of inhibition of binding of the spike receptor
binding domain (RBD) to its human host receptor (in the assay, recombinant) angiotensin

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with inhibition above 20% being correlated with a level of anti-S
antibody that is predicted to be neutralizing. All sera samples were diluted 1:30.
ELISpot for assessment of cytokine secretion
ELISpot assays were used to detect cytokines secreted by fresh peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) isolated from the blood of NHP study animals. PBMCs were isolated from whole
blood by standard density gradient centrifugation and frozen in liquid nitrogen until use. PBMCs
were thawed and re-suspended in RPMI 10% human AB serum, then pulsed with 2 µg/ml of
SARS-CoV-2 S or N peptide pools (JPT Peptide Technologies catalogue # PM-WCPV-S and PMWCPV-NCAP-1 respectively). Negative and positive controls were cells cultured with media
alone or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 µg/ml), respectively. For
IFN-γ assessment, PBMCs were cultured (17 hours at 37°C) in a microtiter plate (Millipore
catalogue # MAIPS4510) containing an immobilized primary antibody to capture NHP-specific
IFN-g (MabTech catalogue # 3421M-3-1000). IFN-g was detected by a secondary antibody to
human IFN-g conjugated to biotin (MabTech catalogue # 3420-6-250). A streptavidin/horseradish
peroxidase conjugate (Thermo Fisher catalogue # 21126) was used detect the biotin-conjugated
secondary antibody. IFN-γ spot development was completed using a peroxidase substrate kit
(Vector Labs catalogue # SK-4200). The number of spots per well (3.5 x 105 PBMCs) was counted
using an ELISpot plate reader. IL-4 was assessed using a commercial ELISpot kit (MabTech
catalogue # 3410-APW-2) using the manufacturer’s instructions. Numbers for graphing were
adjusted to spot-forming cells per 106 PBMCs.
Determination of viral load and viral replication post-challenge
RT-qPCR assays were performed to quantify total SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies including
genomic RNA using the nucleocapsid protein gene as a target or subgenomic RNA copies that are
replication intermediates of the virus using the envelope protein (E) gene as a target. These assays
were performed to quantify viral loads following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. RNA was isolated from
swabs and bronchioalveolar lavage fluid using the Indispin QIAcube HT Pathogen Kit (Indical
Bioscience, Germany) on the QIAcube HT instrument (Qiagen, Germany). The isolated RNA was
then evaluated in RT-qPCR using the TaqMan Fast Virus 1-step Master Mix (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) on a QuantStudio Flex 6 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems; Foster City,
CA). The primers and probe for total SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantitation were specific to the
nucleocapsid protein gene, corresponding to the N1 sequences from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR
Diagnostic
Panel
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primerprobes.html) except that the probe quencher was modified to Non-Fluorescent Quencher-Minor
Groove Binder (NFQ-MGB) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The primers and probe for the
subgenomic RNA quantitation were specific to the E gene subgenomic RNA (Integrated DNA
Technologies, Iowa) (28). A standard curve comprised of synthetic RNA containing the
corresponding target sequence from SARS-CoV-2 isolate WA1 sequence (GenBank Accession
Number MN985325.1) (Bio-Synthesis, Inc.; Lewisville, TX) was included on each PCR plate for
absolute quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies in each sample. Thermocycling conditions
were: Stage 1 - 50°C for 5 min for one cycle; Stage 2 - 95°C for 20 sec for one cycle; Stage 3 95°C for 3 sec and 60°C for 30 sec for 40 cycles. Data analysis was performed using the
QuantStudio 6 software-generated values (total copies per well of each sample) and additional
calculations to determine SARS-CoV-2 RNA or subgenomic RNA copies per mL of fluid.

Lymphocytes
The reported values for lymphocytes from Study Day 0 to 70 are shown below in Figure S2.
Lymphocyte levels were varied at baseline, being higher in NHP entered into Group 2, but
lymphocytes dropped in Group 2 animals by Day 14 (a vaccination Day). Lymphocytes showed a
trend to increase in all groups between Day 14 and Day 21, and then became lower on Days 28
and 42. NHP were moved to the BSL3 facility on Day 42 and on Day 56 (the day of challenge)
mean lymphocyte levels were similar all groups. By Day 57 (also referred to as Day1 postchallenge in the main text), lymphocyte levels decreased in all groups. Overall, lymphocytes
increased on Days 59 and 70, at which time mean levels were higher in vaccinated NHP.
