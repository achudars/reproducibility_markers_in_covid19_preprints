Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has so far infected more than 100 million
people globally, and continues to undergo genomic evolution. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants show
increased infectivity and may lead to resistance against immune responses of previously immunized
individuals or existing therapeutics, especially antibody-based therapies.
Several monoclonal antibody therapeutics authorized for emergency use or in development start to
lose potency against various SARS-CoV-2 variants. Cocktails of two different monoclonal antibodies
constitute a promising approach to protect against such variants as long as both antibodies are potent,
but come with increased development complexity and therefore cost. As an alternative, we developed
two multi-specific DARPin® therapeutics, each combining three independent DARPin® domains binding
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in one molecule, to potently neutralize the virus and overcome virus
escape.
Here, we show in a panel of in vitro studies that both multi-specific DARPin® therapeutics, ensovibep
(MP0420) and MP0423, are highly potent against the new circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (UK
variant) and B.1.351 (South African variant) and the most frequent emerging mutations in the spike
protein. Additionally, viral passaging experiments show potent protection by ensovibep and MP0423
against development of escape mutations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the cooperative binding
of the individual modules in a multi-specific DARPin® antiviral is key for potent virus inhibition and
protection from escape variants. These results, combined with the relatively small size and high
production yields of DARPin® molecules, suggests ensovibep and MP0423 as superior alternatives to
monoclonal antibody cocktails for global supply and demonstrate the strength of the DARPin® platform
for achieving potent and lasting virus inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other viruses.

Introduction
After more than a year of the COVID-19 pandemic, new circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been
described that show resistance against the immune response of previously immunized individuals1,2 or
available therapeutics3,4. In many regions around the globe, governments are implementing lock-down
measures to contain rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 spike variants associated with increased
transmissibility5. Recently identified variants in the UK (B.1.1.7 lineage), South Africa (B.1.351 lineage)6
and Brazil (P.1. lineage)2 share mutations on the spike protein, which have evolved independently.
Amongst those, mutations K417E/N/T, E484K and N501Y are of major concern, as these residues are
associated with a change in receptor binding, and thus increased transmissibility and/or immune
escape of the virus3,7,8.
Other mutations confer resistance against monoclonal antibody therapeutics, including N439K, where
independent lineages were originally detected in Scotland, subsequently in Romania and then spread
in many countries such as the USA3. Further amino acid changes, which may reduce therapeutic options
are Y453F, which evolved in Danish mink farms9, and less common mutations, such as G446V, G476S,
T478I, P479S, V483A, F486V, F490S and Q493K, originally described by Baum et al.10. Additional
mutations which occur globally at high frequencies such as A222V, S477N, D614G and Q675H11,12 are
considered less of a concern to date.
To circumvent the loss of potency of single monoclonal neutralizing antibodies, antibody cocktails were
generated, providing a higher resistance against escape mutations10,13. However, this strategy is
associated with increased manufacturing costs and limited global supply capacities14.
We have applied our DARPin® platform that allows fast generation and cost-effective production of
multi-specific therapeutics to generate anti-SARS-CoV-2 multi-specific DARPin® antivirals, with very
high neutralizing potencies, which were described previously15. In brief, DARPin® molecules are
structurally completely different from antibodies and consist of a single chain of linked DARPin®
domains; in this case the molecules have two N-terminal human serum albumin (HSA) binding domains
for systemic half-life extension and three spike protein binding domains at the C-terminus. The
relatively small size of these multi-specific DARPin® antivirals, in the range of 75-85 kDa, in conjunction
with the high thermal stability, solubility and very high production yields make these molecules an
attractive therapeutic alternative to antibody cocktails.
Two of these DARPin® antivirals, ensovibep and MP0423, are currently in clinical and pre-clinical
development. The viral inhibition mode of ensovibep is based on three distinct DARPin® domains
targeting the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) while MP0423 has three DARPin® domains directed to
three different domains of the spike protein: the RBD, the N Terminal Domain (NTD) and the S2 domain.

The tripartite binding and RBD-independent neutralization mechanism allow the MP0423 molecule to
lose binding to any of its domains while maintaining a high neutralizing potency.
Here, we demonstrate that the two multi-specific DARPin® designs confer protection against a panel of
relevant spike mutations as well as two SARS-CoV-2 variants recently identified in the UK (lineage
B.1.1.7, del69-70, del145, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H) and South Africa
(early evolved variant of lineage B.1.351; D80A, D215G, E484K, N501Y, A701V). In addition, we show in
a viral passaging experiment that the multi-specific DARPin® antivirals’ protection against development
of viral escape mutants is comparable to that of the best characterized and efficacious monoclonal
antibody cocktails to date10. These data confirm the tripartite design as critical against emerging
mutations and strongly validate the further development of ensovibep and MP0423.

Results
Ensovibep and MP0423 are highly potent against the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 UK variant B.1.1.7
and South African variant B.1.351 as well as almost all tested spike protein point mutations
The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates cell entry through binding to the human ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of infecting non-primate hosts, such as felines and minks16. The promiscuity
of a multi-host life style is often an indicator of early, still sub-optimal adaptation of the virus to its new
host. This suggests inherent dynamic plasticity and potential for further human adaptation. The
receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein forms the interface with ACE2. Site mutagenesis
scanning and structure analysis revealed critical residues for this interaction, i.e. L455, F456, A475,
F486, F490 and Q4937,17. Notably, single amino acid substitutions N439R, L452K, NT470, E484P, Q498Y
and N501T have been shown to increase the affinity for human ACE27. Consistent with these
experimental findings, mutations N439K and N501Y appeared in rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 spike
variants in association with facilitated receptor binding and increased transmissibility3,8,18. The RBD
domain is also immunogenic, and among others residues, K444, E484, and F486 have been shown to
be critical for the binding of neutralizing antibodies13.
In the present study we analyzed the impact of selected critical residues on the neutralization capacity
of ensovibep and MP0423 (Figure 1). To assess the potency of the mono-specific and multi-specific
DARPin® molecules, we used VSV-based pseudoviruses carrying the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type or mutant
spike protein at their surface. These pseudoviruses were used in neutralization tests with multi-specific
DARPin® molecules ensovibep and MP0423 or control neutralizing antibodies REGN10933 and
REGN10987. A summary of the calculated IC50 values are reported in Table 1a and Table 1b.
The results show that ensovibep can neutralize variants of the UK originated lineage B.1.1.7 (del69-70,
del145, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H) and the South African originated lineage
B.1.351 (D80A, D215G, E484K, N501Y, A701V) as efficiently as the wild-type virus with IC50 values in the
low single-digit ng/mL range. While MP0423 remained highly potent against the B.1.351 variant, a slight
potency loss to 70 ng/mL (i.e. ~20-fold lower than wild-type) was observed against the UK variant
B.1.1.7. It is interesting to note that the RBD binder of MP0423 (i.e. RBD-2) retained the same
neutralization ability for B.1.1.7 compared to the wild type. Since the inactivation of the NTD binder of
MP0423 does not affect the potency of the molecule (Suppl. Figure 2), the observed potency drop is
thought to be caused by the exposed mutations in the S2 domain (potentially P681H and T716I) alone
or in combination with the NTD mutations. The structural determinants responsible for this potency
drop are currently under investigation to confirm this hypothesis.

Both multi-specific DARPin® antivirals, ensovibep and MP0423, protected well against all individual
mutations tested, with the notable exception of F486V for ensovibep and all three mono-valent
DARPin® RBD binders.
As F486 is a critical residue for ACE2 binding, selective pressure on the virus favors its conservation,
thus maintaining an important anchoring element for the binding of ensovibep. The major impact of
this mutation on ensovibep is not surprising, as previous structural analysis identified F486 as a core
interacting residue for the three related but different RBD binders15. Consequently, the mutation F486V
destabilizes the binding of the entire tri-specific ensovibep molecule to the spike protein.
Taken together, our analysis confirms that the multi-specific DARPin® molecules are highly potent
against spike proteins carrying the most frequently observed mutations as well as mutations known to
impact the binding of neutralizing antibodies, as expected from the multi-specific design.

Passaging of SARS-CoV-2 under therapeutic pressure from DARPin® antivirals and monoclonal antibodies
Previous studies have shown that viral escape mutants may rapidly appear under selective pressure of
a therapy1,13. We used a viral passaging model adapted from Baum et al.10, to estimate the risk of viral
escape from therapeutic pressure of ensovibep and MP0423 and of a cocktail of the two Regeneron
monoclonal antibodies REGN10933 & REGN10987, in comparison to the mono-valent DARPin® binder
RBD-2 and to the monoclonal antibodies S309, REGN10933 and REGN10987 applied as single
molecules.
1.5 x 106 pfu of a French SARS-CoV-2 isolate (with the following differences to the Wuhan wild-type:
V367F; E990A) were serially passaged in the presence of increasing concentrations of DARPin® and
antibodies (Figure 2A, Figure 2B). Resistant escape variants were further selected by passaging the
supernatant of cultures showing significant virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) under the selection
pressure of the highest therapeutic concentration onto fresh cells while maintaining the selective
pressure of increasing concentrations of therapeutic antivirals. After the first incubation cycle of four
days (passage 1) the mono-valent DARPin® binder RBD-2 and the multi-specific DARPin® antivirals, as
well as the antibody antivirals REGN10933 and the antibody cocktail (REGN10933 & REGN10987)
conferred protection at the same concentration of 0.4 µg/mL. The monoclonal antibody S309 was less
efficient, requiring a higher concentration (10 µg/mL) for protection and the monoclonal antibody
REGN10987 was not protective up to the highest concentration tested of 50 µg/mL. Under continuous
selective pressure through passage 2 to 4, the monovalent DARPin® binder RBD-2, and the individual
monoclonal antibodies REGN10987 and REGN10933 lost the capacity to protect cells, which manifested
in complete CPE up to the highest concentration tested. In contrast, ensovibep and MP0423, as single

molecules or as in combination, and the cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies remained effective and
protected cells from CPE throughout the 4 passages.
While the application of ensovibep and MP0423 as single agents required higher concentrations,
respectively 2 µg/mL and 10 µg/mL, after 4 passages, the combination of the two DARPin® antivirals
retained effectiveness at a low concentration of 0.08 µg/mL. The mixture of the two monoclonal
antibodies, REGN10933 & REGN10987, prevented the selection of escape mutants at a concentration
of 0.4 µg/mL after passage 4.

Discussion
Novel emerging variants of the virus are an ever-present threat, as they may escape the antibodies
generated during immunization or developed as therapeutics.
Here, we show that our two multi-specific DARPin® antivirals give high levels of protection against the
currently most frequently reported SARS-CoV-2 mutations as well as two recently identified variants.
Neutralization tests using VSV-based pseudoviruses carrying SARS-CoV-2 spike variants with nine
mutations of the UK lineage B.1.1.7 and five mutations for the South African lineage B.1.351 showed
inhibitory potencies for ensovibep that were comparable to that for the corresponding wild type form.
While MP0423 was also highly active against the B.1.351 variant, a partial potency decrease was
observed against the UK variant B.1.1.7, which is likely caused by a loss of binding on the S2 binding
DARPin® domain. Of note, this lowered potency is still in therapeutically active potency range described
by many monoclonal antibodies.
The analysis of all the most frequently occurring single-point mutations (i.e. A222V, K417E, N439K,
S477N, E484K, N501Y, D614G) in pseudovirus-based neutralization tests resulted in no loss in potency
for both DARPin® antivirals. In addition, we also evaluated less frequent single point-mutations (i.e.
G446V, G476S, T478I, P479S, V483A, F486V, Q493K, F490S) within the epitope region of the three RBD
binders of ensovibep15 or mutations known to impact other therapeutics10,19,20. Among all tested single
mutations, only F486V caused a strong decrease in potency for ensovibep, when compared to the wildtype. This finding is in line with our previous structural analysis15. Most importantly, F486 is also a critical
residue for the virus itself, allowing binding to the ACE2 receptor and thus cell infection. Therefore,
mutations of the phenylalanine at position 486 will decrease the affinity between the RBD and human
ACE2 receptor and lower the infectivity of the virus21,22. To date, F486 is not present at high frequency
in any circulating SARS-CoV-2 strain. In contrast to the loss of potency observed with the single RBD
binders, one of which is in MP0423, mutation of F486V did not impact negatively on the neutralization
capacity of MP0423. This highlights the value of the triple epitope binding mechanism of action of
MP0423 – loss of binding of one of the domains is compensated for by the remaining two. This is also
described in Suppl Fig 2.
Some mutations at positions that were not predicted as key interaction residues for the three distinct
RBD binders (e.g. E484K or Q493K), led to a reduction of the potency in one or several of the RBD
binders, while the tri-specific ensovibep molecules maintained the full neutralization capacity. This
demonstrates that a tri-specific DARPin® design with cooperative binding permits high potency
inhibition, even in the case of one DARPin® domain losing binding affinity. This cooperativity is an

exclusive feature of a tri-specific approach, highlighting a key advantage of the multi-specific DARPin®
design over cocktails of antibodies.
The high level of protection against viral escape mutations by ensovibep and MP0423 was further
demonstrated in a viral passaging experiment: the single monoclonal antibodies and the monovalentDARPin® RBD-2 binder were rapidly overcome by escape mutants, whereas both multi-specific DARPin®
antivirals, individually or in combination, maintained potency up to passage 4, to an extent comparable
to one of the best monoclonal antibody cocktails with emergency use authorization (EUA) status. Deep
sequencing of the viral spike gene in various pools is currently in progress and will provide further
insight into the modes of action of the two DARPin® antivirals.
Encouraged by the high level of neutralization of the two multi-specific DARPin® antivirals against the
mutations and new variants evaluated in this study, further characterizations of the impact of additional
mutations, such as at position K417 observed in the Brazilian P.1 lineage (K417T) or newer South African
variants (K417N), are in progress and will remain an ongoing topic for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, as well
as for current therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19

Figure 2: Ensovibep and MP0423 protect from viral escape mutants: A) Schema�c representa�on of the
procedure: French SARS-CoV-2 isolate from early 2020 (1.5 x106 pfu) was incubated in presence of
increasing concentra�ons of DARPin® or an�body for 4 days on Vero E6 cells and virus-induced
cytopathic eﬀects (CPE) were determined by microscopy. For each DARPin® and an�body condi�on,
cultures showing signiﬁcant cytopathic eﬀect (≥20%) under the greatest selec�ve pressure were
selected and virus-containing supernatant collected to start a new culture passage on Vero E6 cells,
again under increasing concentra�ons of the corresponding DARPin® or monoclonal an�body
condi�on. Passaging of virus containing supernatant was con�nued in the same manner for a total of 4
passages. B) Tabular representa�on of the cytopathic eﬀects induced by SARS-CoV-2 cultured in
presence of increasing concentra�ons of mono-valent DARPin® binder RBD-2, mul�-speciﬁc DARPin®
an�virals ensovibep and MP0423 or a cocktail of ensovibep and MP0423 and the an�body an�virals
S309, REGN10933 and REGN10987 or a cocktail of REGN10933 and REGN10987 through passage 1 to
4. A cytopathic eﬀect (CPE) judged by microscopy to be less than 20% is colored in blue and a CPE
es�mated ≥20% is colored in red. Indicated with a dark border are the culture supernatants chosen for
further passaging under selec�ve pressure and for deep sequencing (data in process).

Materials and Methods
Generation of His-tagged mono-valent RBD binders, ensovibep, MP0423 and the domain k.o. variants of
MP0423
DARPin® construct selected and cloned as described in Walser et al.15 was transformed in E.coli BL21
cells, plated on LB-agar (containing 1% glucose and 50 μg/ml ampicillin) and then incubated overnight
at 37°C. Single colony was picked into TB medium (containing 1% glucose and 50 μg/ml ampicillin) and
incubated overnight at 37°C, shaking at 230 rpm. Fresh TB medium (containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin) was
inoculated with 1:20 of overnight culture and incubated at 37°C at 230 rpm. At OD600 = 1.1 the culture
was induced by addition of IPTG (0.5mM final concentration) and incubated for further 5h at 37°C and
230 rpm. Harvest was done by centrifugation (10 min 5000 x g). After cell disruption by sonication,
primary recovery was done by heat treatment for 30 min at 62.5°C and subsequent centrifugation (15
min, 12000 x g). 20mM Imidazole and 1% Triton X-100 was added to the supernatant and the 0.22µm
filtered supernatant was further purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (HisTrap FF
crude, Cytiva, Sweden) using the N-terminal His-tag including a wash step with 1% Triton X-100 and a
step elution with 250 mM Imidazole. In a subsequent step, the elution fraction of the IMAC step is
applied on a size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, Cytiva, Sweden) and fractions of interest
are pooled and concentrated. Finally, the concentrated sample was filtered through a 0.22 µm Mustang
E filter for Endotoxin removal and sterile filtration and quality controlled.

Generation of monoclonal antibodies, REGN10933, REGN10987 and S309
Publicly available sequences of variable domains from monoclonal antibodies RGN10933, RGN10987
(WHO Drug Information, Vol. 34, No. 3, 2020, Proposed INN: List 124 – COVID-19) and S309 (PDB:
6WPS) were used to synthetize the corresponding cDNA fragments and cloned into a proprietary
expression vector at Evitria AG (Switzerland). Generated vectors containing the constant
immunoglobulin hIgG1 chain or kappa light chain were used for transfection in Chinese hamster ovary
cells by Evitria. Sterile filtered cell supernatants were purified via affinity purification with HiTrap
MabSelect column followed by a size exclusion chromatography using HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 200
column in PBS pH7.4. Selected fractions were pooled and quality controlled (by SDS-PAGE, size
exclusion chromatography and endotoxin measurement), before use in assays.

mutation were synthesized by Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). High-fidelity Phusion polymerase
(New England Biolabs, USA) was used for all DNA amplification.
Single mutations of the spike protein were generated via two PCR fragments of the spike ORF using
high-fidelity Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs, USA). The first fragment was generated via a
generic forward primer (pCAGGS-5) annealing upstream of the spike ORF and the specific reverse
primer encoding the mutation. The second fragment was generated using the specific forward primer
encoding the mutation and a reverse primer (rbglobpA-R). The two fragments were gel-purified and
used as input for an assembly PCR without addition of flanking primers.
For multi-mutation spike proteins, a complementary pair of primers (forward and reverse) encoding
each mutation was designed. Fragment 1 was generated with forward primer pCAGGS-5 and reverse
primer encoding mutation 1. Fragment 2 was generated using forward primer encoding mutation 1 and
reverse primer encoding mutation 2. All subsequent fragments were generated analogously. DNA
fragments were gel-purified and mixed in equimolar amounts. This mix was used for re-assembly of the
full spike ORF using outer primers pCAGGS-5 and rbglobpA-R.
For both single as well as multi-mutation spike protein, the full-length spike ORF was isolated from an
agarose gel, digested by restriction enzymes NheI/EcoRI and inserted into the pCAGGS vector
backbone. The correct sequence was verified via sequencing the whole ORF of the spike protein by
Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland).

VSV-SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype neutralization assay for mutational analysis and MP0423 domain knock outs
The pseudotype viral system was based on the recombinant VSV*ΔG-Luc vector in which the
glycoprotein gene (G) had been deleted and replaced with genes encoding green fluorescent protein
and luciferase23. Pseudoviruses were generated as reported previously24,25. For the neutralization assay,
an initial dilution of the compounds was followed by three-fold dilutions in quadruplicates in DMEM-2
% [vol/vol] FCS supplemented with 20 μM human serum albumin (CSL Behring). The mixture was mixed
with an equal volume of DMEM-2 % FCS containing 250 infectious units (IU) per well of SARS-CoV-2
pseudoviruses and incubated for 90 min at 37°C. The mix was inoculated onto Vero E6 cells in a clear
bottom white walled 96-well plate during 90 min at 37°C. The inoculum was removed and fresh medium
added, and cells further incubated at 37°C for 16 h. Cell were lysed according to the ONE-Glo™
luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, US) and light emission was recorded using a Berthold®
TriStar LB941 luminometer. The raw data (relative light unit values) were exported to GraphPad Prism
v8.4.3, and the % neutralization values were normalized to the untreated PsV signal. IC50 with 95%
confidence interval were estimated by model of nonlinear regression fit with settings for log (inhibitor)
vs normalized response curves. Data points are plotted by the mean ±SEM (standard error of mean).

Cells and pathogenic virus
Vero E6 cells (kindly provided by Prof. Volker Thiel, University of Bern, Switzerland) were passaged in
Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) (Cat N° M3303) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
supplements (2 mM L-Glutamine, 1% Non-essential amino acids, 100 U/ml Penicillin, 100 μg/ml
Streptomycin, 0.06% Sodium bicarbonate, all from Bioswisstec, Schaffhausen, Switzerland) at 37°C,
>85% humidity and 5% CO2. SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV/IDF0372/2020), kindly provided by Dr. Sylvie van
der Werf from the National Reference Centre for Respiratory Viruses hosted by Institut Pasteur (Paris,
France) was propagated in Vero E6 cells in MEM containing 2% FBS and supplements (2%-FBS-MEM) at
37°C, >85% humidity and 5% CO2. Viral titer was determined by standard plaque, by incubating 10-fold
serial dilutions of the virus for 1h at 37°C on a confluent 24-well plate with Vero E6 cells. Then inoculum
was removed and 1 ml overlay medium (20 ml Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium, 5 ml FBS, 100
U/ml Penicillin, 100 μg/ml Streptomycin, and 25 ml Avicel rc581) was added. After 3 days incubation at
37°C the overlay was removed and the plates stained with crystal violet solution (spatula tip (~4 mg)
crystal violet powder (Sigma Aldrich) solved in 30 ml 37% formalin and 120 ml PBS (Sigma Aldrich).

Viral passaging experiment with authentic SARS-CoV-2
Virus escape studies were adapted from a previously published protocol by Baum et al.10. Briefly, 1:5
serial dilutions of DARPin® antivirals and monoclonal antibodies from 100 μg/mL to 0.032 μg/mL were
prepared in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) containing 2% FBS, supplements and 10 μM human
serum albumin (HSA; CSL Behring, Switzerland; 2%-FBS-MEM + HSA). 500 ul of virus suspension
containing 1.5 x 106 plaque forming units (pfu) SARS-CoV-2 in 2%-FBS-MEM + HSA were mixed with 500
μl of serially diluted DARPin® molecules or monoclonal antibodies and subsequently incubated for 1
hour at 37°C. The mixtures were then transferred to confluent Vero E6 cells in 12 well plates and
incubated for 4 days at 37°C, >85% humidity and 5% CO2. Each culture well was assessed for cytopathic
effect (CPE) by microscopy. Supernatant was removed from wells with the highest DARPin® or antibody
concentrations showing significant CPE (≥20%) and used for total RNA extraction and further passaging.
For subsequent rounds of passaging, remaining 900 μl supernatant of selected wells was diluted to 4
ml in 2%-FCS-MEM + HSA and thereof 500 μl mixed with serial dilutions of DARPin® molecules or
antibodies, incubated and the mixture transferred to 12-well plates with fresh Vero E6 cells as described
above. Cell culture wells were assessed for CPE again after 4 days and the supernatant of wells with
highest DARPin® or antibody concentrations with evident viral replication (CPE) harvested and used for
additional passages. A total of 4 passages were performed this way.

Virus neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV-2 determined by Cell Titer-Glo and real-time RT-PCR
Virus neutralization capacity of mono-valent DARPin® candidate and multi-specific DARPin® molecules
was determined for 100 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 by measuring ATP levels of protected cells in a cell viability
assay. DARPin® molecules were serially diluted 1:4 from 40 nM to 2.4 pM (in triplicates) in 100 μl cell
culture medium (2%-FBS-MEM) enriched with 10 μM HSA in 96 well plates. The diluted DARPin®
antivirals were mixed with 100 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 in 100 μl 2%-FBS-MEM + HSA and incubated for 1 h
at 37°C. DARPin®/virus mixtures (200 μl) were transferred onto confluent Vero E6 cells. The controls
consisted of Vero E6 cells exposed to virus suspension only, to determine maximal cytopathic effect
and of cells incubated with medium only, to determine baseline state of cells. The plates were
incubated for 3 days at 37°C, >85% humidity and 5% CO2. Cell viability was determined by removing
100 μl supernatant from all wells and adding 100 μl CellTiter-Glo reagent as described in the
manufacturers protocol (CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, Promega, Madison, USA).
Luminescence was read after 2 minutes shaking on an orbital shaker, transferring the mixture to an
opaque-walled plate and 10 min incubation at room temperature using the GloMax instrument
(Promega). To determine inhibition of virus replication, the previously removed supernatant (100 μl)
was inactivated in 400 μl AVL-buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and 400 μl 100% ethanol and extracted
and eluted in 100 μl using the MagNAPure 96 system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Viral RNA was
quantified by real-time RT-PCR targeting the E gene (Eurosurveillance | Detection of 2019 novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR) using 5 μl RNA and 20 μl TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step
Master Mix (Life Technologies, Zug, Switzerland). Viral genome equivalents (ge) were calculated using
a regression analysis and an internal standard.

Supplementary Figure 2: Determina�on of the contribu�on of the single DARPin® domains of MP0423 in
the neutraliza�on ac�vity against SARS-CoV-2. A) Schema�c representa�on of the mul�-speciﬁc
MP0423 knock-out (k.o) constructs. In each k.o. construct, the indicated SARS-CoV-2-binding domain is
replaced by a non-binding DARPin®. HSA: HSA-binding DARPin®, RBD: RBD-binding DARPin®, NTD: NTDbinding DARPin®, S2: S2-binding DARPin®; B) Neutraliza�on proﬁles of MP0423 and k.o constructs
against VSV-SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses expressing the wild-type spike protein; C) Upper panel:
protec�ve eﬀect of DARPin® molecules against SARS-CoV-2 (100 pfu)-mediated cytopathic eﬀect.
Depicted are the percentage of cell protec�on conferred by MP0423 or the k.o contructs. Cell
protec�on was determined a�er 3 days of incuba�on by measuring intracellular ATP levels in a cell
viability assay using Cell Titer-Glo. Lower panel: inhibi�on of SARS-CoV-2 viral replica�on quan�ﬁed by
real-�me RT-PCR and expressed as percentage of viral genome equivalents present in the supernatant
of Vero E6 cells exposed to 100 pfu SARS-CoV-2 with increasing amounts of MP0423 or k.o. constructs.
D) IC50/EC50values and potency ranking of the constructs analyzed. No potency loss compared to
MP0423 was observed for MP0423_NTD k.o. while a reduc�on in neutraliza�on ac�vity was observed
for the MP0423_RBD k.o. and the MP0423_S2 k.o. constructs.
