SUMMARY

59

Respiratory failure is the leading cause of COVID-19 death and disproportionately

60

impacts adults more than children. Here, we present a large-scale snATAC-seq dataset

61

(90,980 nuclei) of the human lung, generated in parallel with snRNA-seq (46,500 nuclei),

62

from healthy donors of ~30 weeks, ~3 years and ~30 years of age. Focusing on genes

63

implicated in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, we observed an increase in the proportion of

64

alveolar epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in adult compared to young

65

lungs. Consistent with expression dynamics, 10 chromatin peaks linked to TMPRSS2

66

exhibited significantly increased activity with age and harbored IRF and STAT binding

67

sites. Furthermore, we identified 14 common sequence variants in age-increasing peaks

68

with predicted regulatory function, including several associated with respiratory traits and

69

TMPRSS2 expression. Our findings reveal a plausible contributor to why children are

70

more resistant to COVID-19 and provide an epigenomic basis for transferring this

71

resistance to older populations.

INTRODUCTION

79

Aside from fulfilling gas-exchange functions that are vital for survival beginning with

80

the first breath, the lung functions as a critical barrier to protect against inhaled pathogens

81

such as viruses. As the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the world, the lung came into

82

focus because acute respiratory distress (ARDS) is the primary cause of mortality. Thus,

83

understanding how SARS-CoV-2 infects and impacts the lung has become an urgent call-

84

to-action.

85

The lung is composed of an elaborate airway tree that conducts air to and from the

86

distal gas-exchange units called the alveoli. In an average human adult lung, an estimated

87

480 million alveoli give rise to approximately 1,000 ft 2 of gas-exchange surface area

88

(Ochs et al., 2004). Airway and alveolar epithelium constitute the respiratory barrier that

89

is exposed to inhaled pathogens. Respiratory epithelial cells are thereby at the frontline

90

of infection, although pathogens that have bypassed the barrier can infect other cell types.

91

The human airway epithelium is composed of luminal cells and basal cells. Luminal cells

92

include club cells and goblet cells that moisturize the air and trap pathogens, as well as

93

ciliated cells that sweep out inhaled particles. These luminal cells are underlined by basal

94

cells, which serve as progenitors when luminal cells are lost after infection. The alveolar

95

epithelium is composed of alveolar type 1 cells (AT1s) which line the gas-blood interface

96

and alveolar type 2 cells (AT2s) which produce surfactant to reduce surface tension and

97

protect against pathogens. While SARS-CoV-2 likely infects both the airway and alveolar

98

regions of the lung, it is the damage to the alveolar region that underlines acute respiratory

99

distress syndrome (Du et al., 2020).

100

Several large scale studies including efforts from LungMap and the Human Cell Atlas

101

aim to generate a map of cell types in the human lung with single cell transcriptomics as

102

the central modality (Reyfman et al., 2019; Schiller et al., 2019; Travaglini et al., 2020; Xu

103

et al., 2016). Regions of the human genome, such as promoters or distal enhancers, can

104

regulate cell-type specific gene expression in cis (Consortium, 2012; Roadmap

105

Epigenomics et al., 2015; Thurman et al., 2012). Accessible or ‘open’ chromatin is a

106

hallmark of cis-regulatory elements, and can be assayed using techniques such as

107

DNase-seq and ATAC-seq (Buenrostro et al., 2013; Thurman et al., 2012). To overcome

108

tissue heterogeneity single cell technologies like single cell ATAC-seq have been

109

developed to map the epigenome and gene regulatory programs in component cell types

110

within heterogeneous tissues (Buenrostro et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2018; Cusanovich et

111

al., 2015; Cusanovich et al., 2018; Lareau et al., 2019; Satpathy et al., 2019). Profiles

112

derived from single cells can elucidate cell type-specific cis-regulatory elements,

113

transcriptional regulators driving element activity, and predicted target genes of distal

114

elements using single cell co-accessibility (Cusanovich et al., 2018; Lareau et al., 2019;

115

Pliner et al., 2018; Preissl et al., 2018; Satpathy et al., 2019). Human sequence variants

116

affecting susceptibility to complex physiological and disease traits are enriched in non-

117

coding sequence (Maurano et al., 2015; Pickrell, 2014), and cell type-specific profiles

118

derived from single cell epigenomic data can help prioritize cell types of action for these

119

variants (Chiou et al., 2019; Corces et al., 2020).

120

Both in silico structural modeling as well as biochemical assays have implicated

121

several key host proteins at the top of the hierarchy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. ACE2 has

122

been demonstrated as the receptor for not only the original SARS-CoV, but also SARS-

123

CoV-2 (Lan et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). Based mainly on literature from the original

124

SARS-CoV as well as emerging data from SARS-CoV-2 (Huang et al., 2006; Matsuyama

125

et al., 2020; Reinke et al., 2017; Walls et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2016), TMPRSS2 and

126

CTSL are responsible for fusion of the virus with host cell by cleaving the viral Spike

127

protein. BSG is a receptor that can bind to the SARS-CoV spike protein (Chen et al.,

128

2005) and SARS-CoV-2 contains a novel cleavage site for the protease Furin, adding

129

both genes to the list of host machinery highjacked by the virus (Coutard et al., 2020;

130

Walls et al., 2020). In this study, we will focus on the genes encoding these 5 proteins,

131

ACE2, TMPRSS2, CTSL, BSG, and FURIN, and determine their expression and

132

associated epigenomic landscape at single cell resolution in the non-diseased human

133

lung.

134

In the race to control the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a tremendous collective

135

effort from the research community to elucidate the mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2

136

infection. Our study contributes to this effort through a unique dataset profiling the human

137

lung. First, we generated single cell data across neonatal, pediatric, and adult lungs from

138

three donors in each group. These data allowed us to assess age-associated changes

139

with minimal technical variation. Second, from each lung sample, we generated parallel

140

snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq data. This combination allowed us to associate cell type-

141

specific accessible chromatin profiles that may act as cis-regulatory regions that control

142

cell-type specific gene expression. Using these data, we first addressed cell-type

143

specificity and temporal dynamics of ACE2, TMPRSS2, CTSL, BSG, and FURIN

144

expression. We next identified candidate cis-regulatory elements co-accessible with the

145

promoters of these genes and characterized their cell-type specificity and temporal

146

dynamics. Finally, we profiled sequence variation that may impact cis-regulatory element

147

activity and contribute to differential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

148

Emerging epidemiology data, including on US cases reported by the CDC,

149

demonstrate that many fewer children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and

150

those who tested positive generally show less severe symptoms than adults or elderly

151

individuals (Bi et al., 2020; CDC, 2020). This age divide coincides with the finding that

152

normal lung development in humans continues until the early 20s (Narayanan et al.,

153

2012). Therefore COVID-19 preferentially impacts fully mature lungs relative to

154

developing lungs. Widespread speculation has attempted to explain these age-

155

associated differences, including immune senescence in the aging population. Defining

156

the mechanism underlying the apparent resistance of children to COVID-19 will inform

157

how we can transfer this resistance to adult and elderly populations.

RESULTS

161
162

Single nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data generation

163

To profile cell type specific gene expression and accessible chromatin dynamics in

164

the human lung, we performed single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and single nucleus

165

ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) of non-diseased human lung tissue from donors of three age

166

groups: ~30 week old gestational age (GA, prematurely born, 30wk GA), ~3 year old (3yo),

167

and ~30 year old (30yo) (Supplementary Table 1). Three lungs were sampled for each

168

age group, with both males and females represented (Supplementary Table 1). Of the 9

169

donors, 5 were Caucasian, 1 was African American and 3 were of unknown ancestry. For

170

all samples, flash frozen biopsies from equivalent small airway regions of the lung were

171

used. Nuclei were isolated from individual biopsies and split into two pools, one for

172

snRNA-seq and one for snATAC-seq. For snATAC-seq, we generated technical

173

replicates for one of the 3yo donors (D032) and an additional dataset for a lung sample

174

from a 4-month-old donor (Supplementary Table 1).

175

To generate snRNA-seq libraries, we used the droplet-based Chromium Single Cell

176

3’ solution (10x Genomics) (Zheng et al., 2017). The datasets showed a clear separation

177

of nuclei from background in the knee plot (Figure S1A). The average number of nuclei

178

that passed initial quality control filtering per sample was 6,676 for 30wk GA, 7,379 for 3yo,

179

and 4,217 for 30yo (Figure S1B). Since we profiled nuclei with a high fraction of nascent,

180

unspliced RNA molecules, sequencing reads were mapped to an exon+intron reference.

181

We detected on average 1,662 gene/nuclei for 30wkGA, 1,394 for 3yo and 1,260 for 30yo

182

(Figure S1C). Libraries were sequenced to comparable saturation (58.4 % for 30wk GA,

183

51.6 % for 3yo and 55.0 % for 30yo; Fig. S1D).

184

For snATAC-seq library generation we used a semi-automated combinatorial

185

barcoding platform (Cusanovich et al., 2015; Fang et al., 2019; Preissl et al., 2018) . For

186

each dataset, nuclei with >1,000 uniquely mapped sequencing reads were included in the

187

analysis (Fig. S1E). The average number of nuclei that passed this threshold per age

188

group was 8,691 for 30wkGA, 7,877 for 3yo and 8,034 for 30yo (Fig. S1F). The average

189

number of reads per nucleus was 6,399 for 30wkGA, 7,199 for 3yo and 8,362 for 30yo

190

(Fig. S1G). The fraction of reads in peaks (FRiP) on average per data set was 52.8 % for

191

30wkGA, 54.4 % for 3yo and 45.6 % for 30yo (Fig. S1H). These values indicate

192

consistently high signal to noise ratios for all libraries.

193
194

Age-linked increase in host genes for SARS-CoV-2 entry

195

In total, 46,500 single nucleus transcriptomes were included in the analysis after

196

filtering out low quality nuclei and potential barcode collisions (Figure S1, Supplementary

197

Table 2, see Methods). Following batch correction all datasets were merged, and 31

198

clusters were identified (Figure 1A). These clusters represented all major cell types in the

199

small airway region of the lung, as well as rare cell types such as pulmonary

200

neuroendocrine cells (Figure 1A, Figure S2A, Supplementary Table 2). We identified

201

14,527 epithelial cells (31.2 % of all nuclei) in our snRNA-seq dataset. This optimal

202

representation and large number of cells allowed us power to profile gene expression

203

patterns of viral entry genes in lung epithelial cells. For downstream analysis, we excluded

204

an unclassified cluster, and enucleated erythrocytes because the latter were only

205

detected in a single neonatal sample, consistent with immaturity (Figure 1A).

206

Focusing on SARS-CoV-2 viral entry genes, we found that ACE2 transcript was

207

detected in very few nuclei (total 80 nuclei) in the normal lung and these nuclei were

208

enriched within the epithelial lineage (Figure 1B, Supplementary Table 2). Alveolar type

209

2 (AT2) cells had the highest number of ACE2+ nuclei, accounting for 48.8% of all ACE2-

210

expressing nuclei (39 out of total 80 ACE2+ nuclei). In comparison, TMPRSS2 transcript

211

was detected more frequently (e.g. in 3,315/7,226 nuclei, or 45.8% of the AT2 cells,

212

Figure 1C, Supplementary Table 2). Most TMPRSS2-expressing cells were epithelial

213

cells including alveolar type 1 and 2 (AT1, AT2) cells and airway cells such as club,

214

ciliated and goblet cells (Figure 1C, Supplementary Table 2). We also detected significant

215

correlation between the fraction of ACE2+ and TMPRSS2+ AT2 nuclei (Figure S2E) and

216

found 21 of the 39 ACE+ AT2 cells also expressed TMPRSS2 (Supplementary Table 2).

217

The other three candidate genes of SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry CTSL, BSG and FURIN

218

were expressed in a large number of AT1, AT2, matrix fibroblast, and M1 macrophage

219

cells, as well as a small number of additional cell types (Figure S2B-D, Supplementary

220

Table 2). These findings suggest that among cells that constitute the barrier exposed to

221

inhaled pathogens, cell types in both the airway and alveolar epithelium express genes

222

critical for SARS-CoV-2 entry.

223

We next asked if there were genes enriched in ACE2+ AT2 cells as compared to ACE2-

224

AT2 cells to identify potentially co-expressed genes. Among genes that showed a trend

225

for higher expression in ACE2+ compared to ACE2- cells was IFNGR1 (log2 (fold change)

226

= 0.4, -log10(p-value)=5.0; FDR corrected p=0.257, Supplementary Table 3), raising the

227

possibility that ACE2 may be co-regulated with interferon pathway genes, in line with

228

conclusions of a recent study (Ziegler, 2020). In our data generated from normal lungs

229

this correlation was modest, suggesting there is low baseline co-expression of ACE2 and

230

IFNGR1. Among genes with increased expression in TMPRSS2+ versus TMPRSS2- AT2

231

cells was ICAM1 (log2 (fold change)=0.27, -log10(FDR corrected p)=12.2, Supplementary

232

Table 3), which encodes a receptor for Rhinovirus (Zhou et al., 2017). The potential co-

233

expression of TMPRSS2 and ICAM1 may contribute to the often-observed co-infection

234

by more than one respiratory virus. Indeed, co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses

235

including Rhinovirus has been observed, promoting urgent calls to halt the clinical

236

practice of using positive test for other respiratory viruses as an indicator for the absence

237

of coronavirus infection (Wang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). To gain additional insight

238

into the potential mechanisms of co-infection, we interrogated the expression of a number

239

of known factors, receptors and proteases that have been implicated in viral entry for

240

several key respiratory viruses (Figure S3)(Battles and McLellan, 2019; Bochkov and

241

Gern, 2016; Laporte and Naesens, 2017; Peck et al., 2015). For examples, consistent

242

with prior findings, we found that CDHR3, a receptor for Rhinovirus C, was expressed

243

most abundantly in ciliated cells (Battles and McLellan, 2019; Bochkov and Gern, 2016;

244

Laporte and Naesens, 2017; Peck et al., 2015). ANPEP, the entry receptor for HCoV-

245

229E, was predominantly expressed in macrophages and to a lesser extent in club and

246

other epithelial cells (Waradon Sungnak, 2020; Yeager et al., 1992). Compared to ACE2,

247

DPP4, which encodes the host receptor for MERS-CoV, was detected much more

248

frequently overall, and especially in AT2, AT1 and T cells (Figure S3) (Raj et al., 2013;

249

Waradon Sungnak, 2020). This single cell resolved view may contribute to a

250

comprehensive map of the routes of respiratory viral entry.

251

The leading cause of death for COVID-19 is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome

252

(ARDS) which is characterized by failure of gas-exchange due to destruction of the

253

alveolar region of the lung (Du et al., 2020). AT2 is an abundant epithelial cell type in the

254

alveolar region and expresses all of the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry genes assayed here and

255

likely bears the brunt of infection. Consequently, we focused on AT2 cells for follow up

256

analysis. We found that the percentage of AT2 cells expressing ACE2 had an increasing

257

trend in 30yo adult samples compared to 3yo samples (Figure 1D). In addition, we found

258

a strong trend of increase in the percentage of AT2 cells expressing TMPRSS2 in adult

259

samples compared to 3yo samples (41.2 ± 6.6% for 3yo and 57.4 ± 7.7% for 30yo, p =

260

0.05 (t-test), Figure 1E). While very few ACE2+/TMPRSS2+ double positive AT2 nuclei

261

were detected, the fraction of these nuclei in all AT2s increased with age (0.2 % (6 nuclei)

262

in 30wkGA, 0.3% (5 nuclei) in 3yo and 0.5% (10 nuclei) in 30yo, Supplementary Table 2).

263

Of note, one of the samples in the 30wkGA cohort D062 appeared to be an outlier in its

264

expression of multiple analyzed genes. A review of pathology notes revealed mild

265

features of respiratory distress syndrome including epithelial autolysis and increased

266

alveolar macrophages in this sample, suggesting potential reasons for the variation. In a

267

supplementary analysis, excluding this sample resulted in stronger age-associated

268

effects (Figure S2F, G). For example, there was a significant increase in the fraction of

269

TMPRSS2+ AT2 cells between 30wkGA and 30yo samples (Figure S2G).

270

The increase in proportion of AT2 cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is unlikely

271

due to differences in genes captured per nucleus as the adult samples had the lowest

272

numbers of genes/nucleus, suggesting that the extent of expression increase is likely a

273

conservative estimation (Figure S1C). In contrast to the percentage of AT2 nuclei

274

expressing these genes, the expression levels per nucleus were not different across

275

different age groups for either ACE2 (no nucleus had >1 UMI detected) or TMPRSS2

276

(Figure 1F). Together, an increased proportion of host cells expressed TMPRSS2 and

277

ACE2 in adults, the latter just a trend due to the sparsity of ACE2+ cells, suggesting that

278

a higher percentage of cells in the adult lung can be infected by SARS-CoV-2.

279

Since a large proportion of COVID-19 patients are elderly, we sought to compare viral

280

entry gene expression in aged lungs to expression in our samples. The LungMap Human

282

older than ~30. We therefore instead, identified 4 publicly available scRNA-seq datasets

283

from non-diseased lungs of ages >55 that served as controls in pulmonary fibrosis studies

284

(Morse et al., 2019; Reyfman et al., 2019). We integrated snRNA-seq data from our study

285

(n=9) with these 4 scRNA-seq samples (Supplementary Table 1) using Seurat 3 (Stuart

286

et al., 2019). AT2 cells clustered together across all samples with minimal evidence for

287

batch effects (Figure S4A). Compared to 30yo samples, we observed a trend for

288

increased frequency of ACE2+ (p = 0.095) and TMPRSS2+ (p = 0.070) AT2 cells in

289

the >55yo group (Aged; Figure S4B). While these patterns are consistent with

290

epidemiological findings that elderly are at highest risk, we make these observations

291

cautiously due to the multiple potential confounding variables present when comparing

292

across independent datasets spanning multiple methodologies.

Annotation of cis-regulatory sequences linked to SARS-CoV-2 viral entry gene

295

activity

296

To investigate cis-regulatory elements driving cell-type specific and age-related

297

patterns of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry gene expression, we examined snATAC-seq data

298

generated from the same nuclei preparations. After batch correction and filtering of low-

299

quality nuclei and likely doublets, we clustered and analyzed a total of 90,980 single

300

nucleus accessible chromatin profiles. We identified 19 clusters representing epithelial

301

(AT2, AT2, club, ciliated, basal and neuroendocrine), mesenchymal (myofibroblast,

302

pericyte, matrix fibroblast 1 and matrix fibroblast 2), endothelial (arterial, lymphatic, and

303

2 clusters of capillaries), and hematopoietic cell types (macrophage, B-cell, T-cell, NK cell

304

and enucleated erythrocyte) (Figure 2A). Supporting these cluster annotations, we

305

observed cell type-specific patterns of chromatin accessibility at known marker genes for

306

each cell type (Figure S5A).

307

Focusing on SARS-Cov-2 viral entry genes, both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were primarily

308

accessible throughout their gene body in alveolar cells such as AT1, AT2, and airway

309

cells such as club, ciliated, and basal cells (Figure 2B). Conversely, the CTSL gene body

310

exhibited chromatin accessibility across epithelial cells, mesenchymal cells, endothelial,

311

and macrophages. BSG and FURIN also showed broad chromatin accessibility patterns

312

with the highest activity in endothelial cells, such as capillaries (Figure 2B). Overall, the

313

patterns of chromatin accessibility across cell types at genes involved in SARS-CoV-2

314

cell entry substantiate our conclusions from snRNA-seq data, including the finding that

315

ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are primarily expressed in alveolar and airway cells (Figure 1B,C).

316

To identify specific cis-regulatory elements that might control cell type-restricted

317

expression of the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry genes in the lung, we aggregated cells within

318

each cell type and called accessible chromatin sites from the aggregated profiles using

319

MACS2 (Zhang et al., 2008). We then identified sites mapping within 650kb of each

320

SARS-CoV-2 viral entry gene, and further identified sites that were co-accessible with the

321

gene promoter using Cicero (Pliner et al., 2018). At the ACE2 locus, we identified 165

322

accessible chromatin sites mapping within the ±650kb window (Figure 2C,

323

Supplementary Table 4). Of these 165 sites, only two were co-accessible with the ACE2

324

promoter (Figure 2C, Supplementary Table 5). We speculate that the low number of co-

325

accessible sites is likely due to the small percentage of ACE2+ nuclei (Figure 1B). When

326

examining the accessibility of the 165 peaks at the ACE2 locus across cell types, we

327

observed clear sub-groupings of sites, including those specific to basal cells, specific to

328

ciliated cells, and shared across basal, ciliated, AT1, AT2, and club cells (Figure 2C,

329

Supplementary Table 5).

330

At the TMPRSS2 locus, we identified 289 accessible chromatin sites mapping in the

331

±650kb window, of which 37 were co-accessible with the TMPRSS2 promoter (Figure 2D,

332

Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). In agreement with TMPRSS2 gene accessibility in

333

alveolar and airway cells, 113 out of the 289 elements exhibited patterns of accessibility

334

specific to basal, ciliated, club, AT1, and AT2 cells. We observed a basal cell-specific

335

cluster and two broader epithelial cell clusters (basal, ciliated, and club enriched; and

336

club, AT1, and AT2 enriched) (Figure 2D, Supplementary Table 5). Notably, the majority

337

of sites co-accessible with TMPRSS2 (25/37) were found within these broad alveolar- and

338

airway-enriched clusters suggesting that these elements are likely responsible for

339

alveolar and airway expression of TMPRSS2.

340

Finally, at the CTSL, FURIN, and BSG loci we identified 262, 293, and 272 accessible

341

chromatin sites, respectively, within a ±650kb window of which 6, 56, and 47 were co-

342

accessible with their respective gene promoters (Figure S5B, C, D, Supplementary

343

Tables 4 and 5). Sites for all three genes exhibited broad patterns of accessible chromatin

344

signal across cell types consistent with broad accessibility across gene bodies. This

345

collection of cell-type resolved candidate cis-regulatory elements associated with SARS-

346

CoV-2 host genes will be critically important for follow up studies to determine how host

347

cell genes are regulated and how genetic variation within these elements contributes to

348

infection rate and disease outcomes.

349
350

Cis-regulatory elements linked to TPMRSS2 are part of an age-related regulatory

351

program associated with immune signaling in AT2 cells

352

Having observed increasing percentages of TMPRSS2 expressing cells with age in

353

AT2 cells (Figure 1E, Figure S2G), we speculated that TMPRSS2 may be under the

354

control of an age-related cis regulatory program. To investigate whether an age-

355

associated cis-regulatory network exists in AT2 cells, we identified accessible chromatin

356

sites in AT2 cells that show dynamic accessibility across donor age groups. Based on our

357

findings from snRNA-seq we speculate that these dynamics will be at least in part due to

358

a higher number of cells expressing these genes rather than more activity within a cell.

359

We tested all possible pairwise age comparisons between AT2 signal from each of the

360

three groups of 30wkGA, 3yo, and 30yo donors while accounting for donor to donor

361

variability (Figure 3A). Overall, we identified 22,745 age-linked sites in AT2 cells which

362

exhibited significant differences (FDR<0.05) in any pairwise comparison (Figure 3A, B).

363

Clustering of these dynamic peaks revealed five predominant groups of age-dependent

364

chromatin accessibility patterns (cI-cV, Fig 3B).

365

We identified two clusters of AT2 sites exhibiting increasing accessibility with age

366

including several sites at candidate genes for SARS-CoV-2 host genes (cIII 30yo enriched

367

and cIV 3yo + 30yo) (Figure 3B, Figure S6A, B). Intriguingly, these two clusters were

368

enriched for processes related to viral infection and immune response such as viral

369

release from host cell, interferon-gamma mediated signaling pathway, and positive

370

regulation of ERBB signaling pathway (Figure 3C, Supplementary Table 6). Also, these

371

age-dependent clusters were also enriched for phenotypes substantiated in mouse

372

studies, such as pulmonary epithelial necrosis, increased monocyte cell number, and

373

chronic inflammation (Fig. 3C, Supplementary Table 6). Further supporting an immune

374

association with age-related chromatin accessibility in AT2 cells, we observed an

375

enrichment of sequence motifs within these clusters for transcription factors involved in

376

immune signaling such as STAT, IRF, and FOS/JUN (Figure 3D, Supplementary Table

377

7).

378

We focused on the TMPRSS2 locus and determined how many of the 37 accessible

379

chromatin sites co-accessible with the TMPRSS2 promoter (in Figure 2D) showed

380

increased accessibility with age in AT2 cells. We identified 13 sites with age-increased

381

accessibility, of which 10 had significant effects (FDR < 0.05 via EdgeR and/or p < 0.05

382

via t-test) (Figure 3E, F, Figure S6, Supplementary Table 5). Age-increasing sites linked

383

to TMPRSS2 harbored sequence motifs for transcription factors such as NKX, FOXA,

384

CEBPA, and inflammation-related factors such as STAT, IRF, and FOS/JUN (Figure 3G)

385

many of which were corroborated by available ChIP-seq data in lung related samples (Oki

386

et al., 2018). Furthermore, at 12 of the 13 age-increasing sites, we uncovered additional

387

evidence for enhancer-related histone modifications from ENCODE supporting that they

388

have cis-regulatory activity (Figure 3H) (Consortium, 2012). When viewed in genomic

389

context these sites showed a clear age-dependent increase in read depth likely reflecting

390

a higher fraction of accessible nuclei (Figure 3I).

391
392

Genetic variants predicted to affect age-increased TMPRSS2 sites are associated

393

with respiratory phenotypes and TMPRSS2 expression

394

Mapping the discrete accessible chromatin sites at genes required for SARS-CoV-2

395

viral entry allowed us to next characterize non-coding sequence variation that might affect

396

regulation of these sites and contribute to phenotypic differences in the risk of lung

397

disease. In particular, we focused on the 37 sites linked to TMPRSS2 activity including

398

13 with age-increased chromatin accessibility.

399

In total, 8,002 non-singleton sequence variants in the gnomAD v3 database

400

(Karczewski et al., 2019) overlapped a site either linked to or within 250kb of the

401

TMPRSS2 promoter. To determine which of these variants might affect regulatory activity

402

in AT2 cells, we applied a machine learning approach (deltaSVM) (Lee et al., 2015) to

403

model AT2 chromatin accessibility and predict variants with allelic effects on chromatin

404

(see Methods). We identified 721 variants with significant effects (FDR<0.1) on AT2

405

chromatin accessibility, of which 148 mapped in an age-dependent site linked to

406

TMPRSS2 (Figure 4A). Among these 148 variants, 14 were common (defined here as

407

minor allele frequency > 1%) in at least one major population group in gnomAD, several

408

of which were predicted to disrupt AT2 age-dynamic TF motifs such as FOS/JUN, IRF,

409

STAT, RUNX, NKX and ESR1 (Figure 4A). The common variants generally had

410

consistent frequencies across populations, except for rs35074065 which was much less

411

common in East Asians (EAS) relative to other populations (MAF=0.005, Figure 4B).

412

We next determined whether common variants with predicted AT2 regulatory effects

413

were associated with phenotypes related to respiratory function, infection, medication use

414

or other traits using GWAS data generated using the UK Biobank (UKBB) (Sudlow et al.,

415

2015). Across the 11 variants tested for association in UKBB data, the most significant

416

association was between rs35074065 and emphysema (p=5.64×10 -7) (Figure 4C). This

417

variant was also more nominally associated (p<0.005) with asthma (p=6.7×10 -4) and

418

influenza vaccine (p=1.76×10-3). Furthermore, the majority of tested variants (8/11) were

419

nominally associated (p<1x0-3) with at least one phenotype related to respiratory function

420

or respiratory medication use including salmeterol + fluticasone propionate, which is

421

commonly used to treat asthma and COPD (rs7279188 p=1.3×10 -5), bacterial pneumonia

422

(rs2838089 p=2.4×10-4), bronchiectasis (rs9974995 p=7.1×10 -4, rs568517 p=8.1×10-4),

423

and COPD (rs1557372 p=2.9×10 -3) (Figure 4C).

424

Given that common AT2 variants showed predicted regulatory function and

425

association with respiratory disease and infection phenotypes, we next asked whether

426

these variants regulated the expression of TMPRSS2 using human lung eQTL data from

427

the GTEx v8 release. Among variants tested for association in GTEx, we observed a

428

highly significant eQTL for TMPRSS2 expression at rs35074065 (p=3.9×10 -11) as well as

429

more nominal eQTL evidence at rs1557372 (p=2.9×10 -5) and rs9974995 (p=3.5×10-6).

430

Furthermore, in fine-mapping data, rs35074065 had a high posterior probability

431

(PPA=41.6%) and therefore likely has a direct casual effect on TMPRSS2 expression

432

(Figure 4D). This variant further disrupted sequence motifs for IRF and STAT transcription

433

factors, suggesting that its effects may be mediated through interferon signaling and anti-

434

viral programs (Figure 4D).

435

As the TMPRSS2 eQTL at rs35074065 was identified in bulk lung samples, we finally

436

sought to determine the specific cell types driving the effects of this eQTL. Using cell type-

437

specific expression profiles derived from our snRNA-seq data, we estimated the

438

proportions of 14 different cell types present in the 515 bulk lung RNA-seq samples from

439

GTEx v8 (Figure 4E) (Aguet et al., 2019). We then tested the association between

440

rs35074065 and TMPRSS2 expression while including estimated cell type proportions for

441

each sample in the eQTL model (see Methods). We observed highly significant

442

association when including AT2 cell proportion (p=3.8×10 -18) as well as macrophage

443

proportion (p=4.0×10-12), supporting the possibility that the TMPRSS2 eQTL at

444

rs35074065 acts through AT2 cells and macrophages (Figure 4F).

448

In this study, we focused on the lung, the organ at the center of COVID-19 morbidity

449

and mortality. We generated a snATAC-seq reference dataset of the healthy human lung

450

at three postnatal stages, and in parallel generated snRNA-seq data from the same

451

samples to allow comparison with gene expression. Importantly, datasets were produced

452

using uniform tissue procurement and single nucleus technologies for both modalities

453

across samples. This consistency allowed us to uncover age-associated dynamics in

454

gene expression and regulation. While we focus on COVID-19 related genes in this study,

455

the datasets more broadly enable in-depth analysis of cell-type resolved dynamics of

456

chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the human lung. We hope these datasets

457

will be further utilized by the community to enhance knowledge and treatment of lung

458

diseases.

459

One of the strongest findings that has been corroborated by multiple large-scale

460

epidemiological studies is that infants and children, while still susceptible to infection,

461

generally do not develop symptoms as severe as adults (Bi et al., 2020; CDC, 2020).

462

Although the underlying molecular basis of this skew is unclear and is likely multifactorial,

463

our data demonstrate that ACE2+ and TMPRSS2+ and ACE2+/TMPRSS2+ are detected

464

in a higher proportion of AT2 nuclei in adult samples compared to the younger samples.

465

These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may enter proportionally fewer cells in younger

466

lungs compared to adult lungs, leading to tempered viral replication and damage. While

467

we await clinical validation of this finding, this difference in viral entry factors, in addition

468

to likely differences in immune response to viral infection, may explain the age-related

469

bias in COVID-19 severity.

470

The observed increase in the proportion of cells expressing viral entry genes is further

471

corroborated by age-related changes in accessible chromatin, which offers insight for

472

using gene regulatory mechanisms to restrict the expression of viral entry genes. For

473

example, at the TMPRSS2 locus we identified 10 accessible chromatin sites that showed

474

significantly increased accessibility with age. These sites may therefore represent cis

475

regulatory elements that contribute to activation of TMPRSS2 gene expression in an

476

increasing number of cells in adults and represent possible sites to modulate in order to

477

restrict expression. Furthermore, one of the age-dependent sites harbors a sequence

478

variant (rs35074065) significantly associated with TMPRSS2 expression and respiratory

479

phenotypes, suggesting it may be of particular value in this context.

480

To explore potential avenues for manipulating the expression of viral entry genes, we

481

identified transcription factors enriched in sites with increased chromatin accessibility in

482

adult AT2 cells compared to younger AT2 cells. These included transcription factors

483

involved in stress and immune responses. For example, key interferon pathway-related

484

factors STAT and IRF have binding sites in the 10 age-increased TMPRSS2 peaks. The

485

likely causal TMPRSS2 eQTL variant rs35074065 is predicted to disrupt STAT and IRF

486

binding, raising the possibility that STAT and/or IRF binding at this site may directly control

487

TMPRSS2 gene expression.

488

While our findings suggest that interferon pathway transcription factors may play a

489

role in regulating the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes such as TMPRSS2,

490

extensive preclinical studies are needed to validate this regulation in an in vivo context.

491

As a key anti-viral factor, interferon is stimulated in host cells upon infection by viruses,

492

likely including SARS-CoV-2 (Lukhele et al., 2019; Mesev et al., 2019; Xia et al., 2018).

493

The literature contains conflicting data regarding whether and how viral infection may act

494

through the interferon pathway to regulate viral entry gene expression. For example,

495

binding of the original SARS-CoV spike protein to ACE2 receptor in mice led to reduced

496

Ace2 expression in the lung (Kuba et al., 2005). However, a recent single-cell study

497

suggested that viral-induced interferon activation stimulates ACE2 expression (Ziegler,

498

2020). We caution that the potential effect of interferon signaling on COVID-19 needs to

499

be investigated beyond viral entry, as the pathway likely has distinct roles in the different

500

phases of the disease.

501

In our lung snRNA-seq data, ACE2 is detected in a very small number of cells, a

502

finding that is corroborated by a number of recent single cell studies (Qi et al., 2020;

503

Waradon Sungnak, 2020; Zhao et al., 2020; Ziegler, 2020; Zou et al., 2020). The low

504

fraction of nuclei that are ACE2 positive could be due to low overall expression which in

505

turn results in significant dropout in single cell or single nucleus RNA-seq. This suggests

506

the possibility that ACE2 may not be needed at high levels for viral attachment to host

507

cells. Alternatively, it is plausible that alternative receptors such as BSG also facilitate

508

SARS-CoV-2 attachment in vivo. Compared to ACE2, BSG is expressed and co-

509

expressed with proteases in a higher fraction of nuclei in AT2 and in additional cell types

510

in the human lung.

511

To limit SARS-CoV-2 infection by manipulating the expression of viral entry proteins,

512

we caution that inhibiting ACE2 expression should not be a recommended strategy. Aside

513

from being a viral receptor gene, ACE2 is also required for protecting the lung from injury-

514

induced acute respiratory distress phenotypes, the precise cause of COVID-19 mortality

515

(Imai et al., 2005). Thus, inhibiting ACE2 expression may compromise the ability of the

516

lung to sustain damage. In comparison, Tmprss2 mutant mice show no defects at

517

baseline and are more resistant to the original SARS-CoV infection (Iwata-Yoshikawa et

518

al., 2019; Kim et al., 2006). Thus, manipulating the expression of genes such as

519

TMPRSS2 may represent a safer path to limit SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. TMPRSS2 is also

520

involved in the entry of other respiratory viruses such as influenza, suggesting that

521

modulating its expression may also be effective in deterring entry and spread of other

522

viruses (Limburg et al., 2019).

523

In this study, we present the first snATAC-seq dataset of the human lung and

524

complementary snRNA-seq data from the same samples. Here, we used COVID-19

525

genes to demonstrate how this dataset can be utilized. As COVID-19 GWAS data

526

emerge, our datasets will offer a powerful cell type-resolved platform to interrogate

527

mechanisms that may underlie genetic differences in the susceptibility and response to

528

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, our results suggest that modulation of the interferon

529

pathway is a possible avenue to restrict TMPRSS2 expression and viral entry.

530

Identification of regulators that restrict the expression of viral entry genes without

531

detrimentally affecting other aspects of the normal antiviral response will be a safe and

532

effective strategy towards combating COVID-19. We note that this work is a product of

533

the NHLBI-funded LungMap consortium, and our joint goal is to provide the community

534

with fundamental knowledge of the human lung to help combat COVID-19.

METHODS

647

Human subjects and tissue collection

648

Donor lung samples were provided through the federal United Network of Organ

649

Sharing via National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI) and International Institute for

650

Advancement of Medicine (IIAM) and entered into the NHLBI LungMAP Biorepository for

651

Investigations of Diseases of the Lung (BRINDL) at the University of Rochester Medical

652

Center overseen by the IRB as RSRB00047606, as previously described (Ardini-Poleske

653

et al., 2017; Bandyopadhyay et al., 2018). Portions (0.25-1.0 cm 3) of small airway region

654

of right middle lobe (RML) lung tissue were frozen in cryovials over liquid nitrogen and

655

placed at -800C for storage. Upon request, while kept frozen on dry ice, a tissue piece

656

(approximately 100 mg) was chipped off the sample. These smaller samples were then

657

shipped in cryovials to UCSD on an abundance of dry ice.

658
659

Single nucleus ATAC-seq data generation

660

Combinatorial barcoding single nucleus ATAC-seq was performed as described

661

previously with modifications (Cusanovich et al., 2015; Fang et al., 2019; Preissl et al.,

662

2018) and using new sets of oligos for tagmentation and PCR (Supplementary Table 8).

663

Briefly, for each sample, lung tissue was homogenized using mortar and pestle on liquid

664

nitrogen. 1 ml nuclei permeabilization buffer (10mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.5), 10mM NaCl, 3mM

665

MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma), 0.1% IGEPAL-CA630 (Sigma) and 0.01% Digitonin

666

(Promega) in water (Corces et al., 2017)) was added to 30 mg of ground lung tissue and

667

tissue was resuspended by pipetting for 8-15 times. Nuclei suspension was incubated for

668

10 min at 4°C and filtered with 30 μm filter (CellTrics). Nuclei were pelleted with a swinging

669

bucket centrifuge (500 x g, 5 min, 4°C; 5920R, Eppendorf) and resuspended in 500 μL

670

high salt tagmentation buffer (36.3 mM Tris-acetate (pH = 7.8), 72.6 mM potassium-

671

acetate, 11 mM Mg-acetate, 17.6% DMF) and counted using a hemocytometer.

672

Concentration was adjusted to 2,000 nuclei/9 μl, and 2,000 nuclei were dispensed into

673

each well of one 96-well plate. For tagmentation, 1 μL barcoded Tn5 transposomes (Fang

674

et al., 2019) was added using a BenchSmart™ 96 (Mettler Toledo), mixed five times and

675

incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with shaking (500 rpm). To inhibit the Tn5 reaction, 10 µL

676

of 40 mM EDTA were added to each well with a BenchSmart™ 96 (Mettler Toledo) and

677

the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with shaking (500 rpm). Next, 20 µL 2 x sort

678

buffer (2 % BSA, 2 mM EDTA in PBS) was added using a BenchSmart™ 96 (Mettler

679

Toledo). All wells were combined into a FACS tube and stained with 3 µM Draq7 (Cell

680

Signaling). Using a SH800 (Sony), 20 2n nuclei were sorted per well into eight 96-well

681

plates (total of 768 wells) containing 10.5 µL EB (25 pmol primer i7, 25 pmol primer i5,

682

200 ng BSA (Sigma). Preparation of sort plates and all downstream pipetting steps were

683

performed on a Biomek i7 Automated Workstation (Beckman Coulter). After addition of 1

684

µL 0.2% SDS, samples were incubated at 55 °C for 7 min with shaking (500 rpm). 1 µL

685

12.5% Triton-X was added to each well to quench the SDS. Next, 12.5 µL NEBNext High-

686

Fidelity 2× PCR Master Mix (NEB) were added and samples were PCR-amplified (72 °C

687

5 min, 98 °C 30 s, (98 °C 10 s, 63 °C 30 s, 72°C 60 s) × 12 cycles, held at 12 °C). After

688

PCR, all wells were combined. Libraries were purified according to the MinElute PCR

689

Purification Kit manual (Qiagen) using a vacuum manifold (QIAvac 24 plus, Qiagen) and

690

size selection was performed with SPRI Beads (Beckmann Coulter, 0.55x and 1.5x).

691

Libraries were purified one more time with SPRI Beads (Beckmann Coulter, 1.5x).

692

Libraries were quantified using a Qubit fluorimeter (Life technologies) and the

693

nucleosomal pattern was verified using a Tapestation (High Sensitivity D1000, Agilent).

694

The library was sequenced on a HiSeq4000 or NextSeq500 sequencer (Illumina) using

695

custom sequencing primers with following read lengths: 50 + 10 + 12 + 50 (Read1 +

696

Index1 + Index2 + Read2). Primer and index sequences are listed in Supplementary

697

Single nucleus RNA-seq data generation

700

Droplet-based Chromium Single Cell 3’ solution (10x Genomics, v3 chemistry)(Zheng

701

et al., 2017) was used to generate snRNA-seq libraries. Briefly, 30 mg pulverized lung

702

tissue was resuspended in 500 µl of nuclei permeabilization buffer (0.1% Triton X-100

703

(Sigma-Aldrich, T8787), 1X protease inhibitor, 1 mM DTT, and 0.2 U/µl RNase inhibitor

704

(Promega, N211B), 2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, SRE0036) in PBS). Sample was incubated

705

on a rotator for 5 minutes at 4°C and then centrifuged at 500 rcf for 5 minutes (4°C, run

706

speed 3/3). Supernatant was removed and pellet was resuspended in 400 µl of sort buffer

(1 mM EDTA 0.2 U/µl RNase inhibitor (Promega, N211B), 2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich,

708

SRE0036) in PBS) and stained with DRAQ7 (1:100; Cell Signaling, 7406). 75,000 nuclei

709

were sorted using a SH800 sorter (Sony) into 50 µl of collection buffer consisting of 1 U/µl

710

RNase inhibitor in 5% BSA; the FACS gating strategy sorted based on particle size and

711

DRAQ7 fluorescence. Sorted nuclei were then centrifuged at 1000 rcf for 15 minutes (4°C,

712

run speed 3/3) and supernatant was removed. Nuclei were resuspended in 35 µl of

713

reaction buffer (0.2 U/µl RNase inhibitor (Promega, N211B), 2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich,

714

SRE0036) in PBS) and counted on a hemocytometer. 12,000 nuclei were loaded onto a

715

Chromium controller (10x Genomics). Libraries were generated using the Chromium

716

Single Cell 3′ Library Construction Kit v3 (10x Genomics, 1000078) according to

717

manufacturer specifications. CDNA was amplified for 12 PCR cycles. SPRISelect reagent

718

(Beckman Coulter) was sued for size selection and clean-up steps. Final library

719

concentration was assessed by Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo-Fischer Scientific)

720

and fragment size was checked using Tapestation High Sensitivity D1000 (Agilent) to

721

ensure that fragment sizes were distributed normally about 500 bp. Libraries were

722

sequenced using the NextSeq500 and a HiSeq4000 (Illumina) with these read lengths:

723

28 + 8 + 91 (Read1 + Index1 + Read2).

724
725

Single nucleus RNA-seq analysis

726

Sequencing reads were demultiplexed (cellranger mkfastq) and processed (cellranger

727

count) using the Cell Ranger software package v3.0.2 (10x Genomics). Reads were

728

aligned to the human reference hg38 (Cell Ranger software package v3.0.2). Reads

729

mapping to intronic and exon sequences were retained. Resulting UMI feature-barcode

730

count matrices were loaded into Seurat (Stuart et al., 2019). All genes represented in >=3

731

nuclei and cells with 500-4000 detected genes were included for downstream processing.

732

UMI counts were log-normalized and scaled by a factor of 10,000 using the

733

NormalizeData function. Top 3000 variable features were identified using the

734

FindVariableFeatures function and finally scaled using the ScaleData function. Barcode

735

collisions were removed for individual datasets using DoubletFinder (McGinnis et al.,

736

2019) with following parameters: pN =0.15 and pK = 0.005, anticipated collision rate =

737

10%. Clusters were assigned a doublet score (pANN) and classification as “doublet” or

738

“singlet”; called doublets and cells with a pANN score > 0 were removed. UMI matrices

739

for datasets were merged and corrected for batch effects due to experiment date, donor,

740

and sex using the Harmony package (Korsunsky et al., 2019). UMAP coordinates and

741

clustering were performed using the RunUMAP, FindNeighbors, and FindClusters

742

functions in Seurat with principal components 1-23. 25-26, and 28. Clusters were

743

annotated, and putative doublets as defined by expression of canonically mutually

744

exclusive markers were excluded from analysis; remaining cells were re-clustered using

745

the previously described parameters. Final cluster annotation was done using canonical

746

markers. For genes of interest such as (e.g. ACE2, TMPRSS2), nuclei with at least one

747

UMI for the gene were considered “expressing”. To analyze changes in percentage of

748

nuclei expressing we performed One-way ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) with post-hoc

749

Tukey HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.0 for

750

Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA, www.graphpad.com. Due to

751

one potential outlier in the 30wkGA group (D062) we performed in addition a simple t-test

752

comparing 3 yr to 30 yr groups. Differential gene expression analysis between ACE2+

753

and ACE2- AT2 cells we used FindAllMarkers with parameters logfc = 0, min.pct = 0,

754

test.use = "wilcox", verbose = TRUE.

755
756

Normalization and comparison of gene expression frequency across snRNA-seq

757

and scRNA-seq datasets

758

Single cell RNA-seq (10x Genomics 3’ v2) of 4 aged (>55yr) control lungs were

759

obtained from publicly available data (Morse et al., 2019; Reyfman et al., 2019). Raw

760

gene expression matrices were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)

761

repository (GSE128033 and GSE122960). Cells were filtered using the following

762

commonly used criteria: >500 expressed genes and <10% UMIs mapped to mitochondrial

763

DNAs. In addition, cells with greater than or equal to 40,000 UMIs were excluded from

764

the downstream analysis; this filtration criterion was selected based on the distribution of

765

UMIs in single cells in individual donors. Seurat (version 3) (Stuart et al., 2019) was used

766

to identify AT2 cells from individual aged donors. Nuclei from the 9 libraries generated in

767

this study and cells from libraries for the 4 aged donors were integrated using the Seurat

768

3 standard integration pipeline (Stuart et al., 2019).

769

We calculated ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression frequency in AT2 cells (percentage

770

of AT2 cells with >0 UMI) in individual donors. We then performed median based

771

normalization, so all donors reached the same median value. In calculating the median

772

value for each donor, the expression frequency values of genes (n=26,260) common in

773

both datasets were used.

774
775

Single nucleus ATAC-seq analysis

776

For each sequenced snATAC-Seq libraries, we obtained four FASTQ files paired-end

777

DNA reads as well as the combinatorial indexes for i5 (768 different PCR indices) and T7

778

(96 different tagmentation indices; Supplementary Table 8). We selected all reads with

779

<= 2 mistakes per individual index (Hamming distance between each pair of indices is 4)

780

and subsequently integrated the full barcode at the beginning of the read name in the

781

FASTQ files (https://gitlab.com/Grouumf/ATACdemultiplex/). Next, we used trim galore

782

(v.0.4.4) to remove adapter sequences from reads prior to read alignment. We aligned

783

reads to the hg19 reference genome using bwa mem (v.0.7.17) (Li and Durbin, 2009) and

784

subsequently used samtools (Li et al., 2009) to remove unmapped, low map quality

785

(MAPQ<30), secondary, and mitochondrial reads. We then removed duplicate reads on

786

a per-cell basis using MarkDuplicates (BARCODE_TAG) from the picard toolkit. As an

787

initial quality cutoff, we set a minimum of 1,000 reads (unique, non-mitochondrial) and

788

observed 120,090 cells passing this threshold.

789

We used a previously described pipeline to identify snATAC-seq clusters (Chiou et

790

al., 2019). Briefly, we used scanpy (Wolf et al., 2018) to uniform read depth-normalize

791

and log-transform read counts within 5 kb windows. We then identified highly variable (hv)

792

windows (min_mean=0.01, min_disp=0.25) and regressed out the total read depth across

793

hv windows (usable counts) within each experiment. We then merged cells across

794

experiments and extracted the top 50 PCs, using Harmony (Korsunsky et al., 2019) to

795

correct for potential confounding factors including donor-of-origin and biological sex. We

796

used

797

(n_neighbors=30) using the cosine metric, which was used for UMAP visualization

798

(min_dist=0.3) and Leiden clustering (resolution=1.5) (Traag et al., 2019).

Prior to the final clustering results, we performed iterative clustering to identify and

800

remove cells mapping to clusters with aberrant quality metrics. First, we removed 3,183

801

cells mapping in clusters with low read depth. Next, we removed 20,718 cells mapping in

802

clusters with low fraction of reads in peaks. Finally, we re-clustered the cells at high

803

resolution and removed 5,209 cells mapping in potential doublet sub-clusters. On

804

average, these sub-clusters had higher usable counts, promoter usage, and accessibility

805

at more than one marker gene promoter. After removing all of these cells, our final clusters

806

consisted of 90,980 cells. To identify marker genes for each cluster, we used linear

807

regression models with gene accessibility as a function of cluster assignment and usable

808

counts across single cells.

809
810

Computing relative accessibility scores

811

We define an accessible locus as the minimal genomic region that can be bound and

812

cut by the enzyme. We use 𝐿 ⊂ 𝑁 to represent the set of all accessible loci. We further

813

define a pseudo-locus as the set of accessible loci that relates to each other in a certain

814

meaningful way (for example, nearby loci, loci from different alleles). In this example,

815

pseudo-loci correspond to peaks. We use {𝑑 ∣ 𝑑 ⊂ 𝐿} to represent the set of all pseudo-

816

loci. Let 𝑎 be the accessibility of accessible locus 𝑙, where 𝑙 ∈ 𝐿. We define the

817

accessibility of pseudo-locus 𝑑 as 𝐴 = ∑

818

accessible loci associated with di. Let 𝐶 be the library complexity (the number of distinct

819

molecules in the library) of cell 𝑗. Assuming unbiased PCR amplification, then the

820

probability of being sequenced for any fragment in the library is: 𝑠 = 1 − (1 − )𝑘 , where

821

𝑘 is the total number of reads for cell 𝑗. If we assume that the probability of a fragment

822

present in the library is proportional to its accessibility and the complexity of the library,

823

then we can deduce that the probability of a given locus 𝑙 in cell 𝑗 being sequenced is:

824

𝑝 ∝ 𝑎 𝐶 𝑠 . For any pseudo-locus 𝑑 , the number of reads in 𝑑 for cell 𝑗 follows the

825

Poisson binomial distribution, and its mean is 𝑚 = ∑

826

Given a pseudo-locus (or peak) by cell count matrix 𝑂, we have: ∑ 𝑂 = ∑ 𝑚 .

827

Therefore, 𝐴 = 𝑍 ∑

828

different samples the relative accessibility may be desirable as they sum up to a constant,

829

i.e., ∑ 𝐴 = 1 × 10 . In this case, we can derive 𝐴 = ∑

∑

∗ 10 .

830
831

Calculating the relative percent of cells with accessibility at a locus

832

To correct for biases occurring from differential read depths between clusters, we used

833

the following strategy to determine the relative ratio of cells with accessibility at a given

834

locus. We defined the set of accessible loci L of a given dataset D as the genomic regions

835

covered by the set peaks P inferred from D. We define X the set of cells from D, and 𝑆 a

836

partitioning of X. For a given partition 𝑆 ∈ 𝑆 and for each feature 𝑝 ∈ 𝑃, we computed

837

𝑚 the ratio of cells from 𝑆 with at least one read overlapping 𝑝 . We then defined the

838

score 𝑠 of loci 𝑝 in 𝑆 as 𝑠 = 10 . ∑

839

normalized across the different clusters as 𝑅𝑆 = ∑

∈

. We finally define the relative ratio of cells

Associating promoters to candidate distal regulatory elements.

842

To identify AT2 co-accessible loci with the promoters of TMPRSS2, ACE2, FURIN,

843

BSG, and CTSL we used Cicero (Pliner et al., 2018). First, we performed a Cicero

844

analysis for each individual cluster using a genomic window of 1 Mb (co-accessibility

845

score >0.05). In addition, we performed Cicero using a random subset of 15,000 nuclei

846

from the complete dataset and a genomic window of 250 kb (co-accessibility score >0.05).

847

We then defined the promoter regions of ACE2, TMPRSS2, FURIN, BSG, and CTSL as

848

transcriptional start site (TSS) +/- 1 kb and selected the sites co-accessible with each of

849

the promoters (co-accessibility score >0.05). Finally, we merged the elements co-

850

accessible with the gene promoters from both analyses to generate a union set of

851

candidate elements.

852
853

Identification and clustering of AT2 peaks with changes in chromatin accessibility

854

genome-wide

855

We used edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010) to identify differential accessible peaks

856

between each of pair of time points. As input we used the 122,352 peaks in AT2 cell.

857

Dataset ID and sex were used as technical covariates. Sites with False Discovery Rate

858

(FDR) < 0.05 after Benjamini-Hochberg correction were considered significant. Next, we

859

performed K-means using the relative accessibility score with a loci x timepoints matrix.

860

We used K from 5 to 8 and computed the Davis-Bouldin index to determine the best K to

861

partition the loci. let 𝑅

Identification of AT2 peaks with changes in chromatin accessibility at candidate

867

gene loci

868

The ensemble of cells X from D can be divided per timepoint, cell subtype, or donor.

869

We identified for individual donors the relative % of cells with at least one read in peaks

870

associated with ACE2, TMPRSS2, FURIN, BSG, and CTSL promoters. As a background

871

to calculate the relative % of cells, we used the merged set of peaks from all the clusters.

872

Then, we computed a Student test for two independent samples with equal variance for

873

each pair of categories: 30 wkGA, 3 yo and 30 yo. For each element the relative % of cells

874

were used as measurement variable and the timepoint as nominal variable.

Annotation of genomic elements
The GREAT algorithm (McLean et al., 2010) was used to annotate distal genomic
elements using the following settings: 2 nearest gene within 1Mb.

879
880

Transcription factor related analyses

881

De novo motif enrichment analysis in genomic elements was performed using

882

HOMER (Heinz et al., 2010) with standard parameters. Motif scanning was performed

883

using FIMO (Grant et al., 2011) online interface and default parameters. Motif files were

884

downloaded from JASPAR (Fornes et al., 2020) in MEME format. Motifs scanned were

MA0007.2(AR), and MA0592.1(ESRRA). To identify overlap with TF ChIP-seq sites, we

889

used ChIP-atlas (Oki et al., 2018). We downloaded a BED file for “TFs and other” antigens

890

across all lung related samples from the Peak Browser. We intersected these peaks with

891

the TMPRSS2-linked peaks and the FIMO motifs (Grant et al., 2011). In addition, we

892

downloaded enhancer related histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K27ac) from the

893

SCREEN database and intersected with the peak lists (Consortium, 2012).

894
895

Predicting variant effects on chromatin accessibility

896

We used deltaSVM (Lee et al., 2015) to predict the effects of variants on chromatin

897

accessibility in AT2 cells. First, we extracted the sequences underlying AT2 sites that

898

were promoter-distal (>±500 bp from GENCODE v19 transcript TSS for protein-coding

899

and long non-coding RNA genes). As described previously (Chiou et al., 2019), we trained

900

an AT2 sequence-based model and used it to predict effects for all possible combinations

901

of 11mers. Next, to compile a comprehensive set of variants to test, we downloaded lists

902

of variants from gnomAD v3 (Karczewski et al., 2019) and filtered out variants that were

903

singletons or indels longer than 3 bp. We then used the liftOver (Tyner et al., 2017) utility

904

to transform GRCh38 into GRCh37/hg19 coordinates. We retained variants from either

905

dataset that mapped within TMPRSS2 linked sites and extracted sequences in a 19 bp

906

window around each variant (±9 bp flanking each side). Finally, we calculated deltaSVM

907

z-scores for each variant by predicting deltaSVM scores, randomly permuting 11mer

908

effects and re-predicting deltaSVM scores, and using the parameters of the null

909

distribution to calculate deltaSVM z-scores. From the z-scores, we calculated p-values

910

and q-values and defined variants with significant effects using a threshold of FDR<0.1.

911

We identified common variants defined as minor allele frequency >.01 in at least one

912

major population group. For each common variant, we obtained sequence surrounding

913

each variant allele and predicted sequence motifs from the JASPAR database (Fornes et

914

al., 2020) using FIMO (Grant et al., 2011), and focused on motifs of TF families enriched

915

in age-dependent AT2 chromatin.

918

We downloaded UK biobank round 2 GWAS combined sex results (Lab, 2020; Sudlow

919

et al., 2015). We used broad disease categories from the ICD-10-CM to classify ICD10

920

phenotypes, except for ICD10 codes relating to unclassified symptoms, external causes

921

of morbidity, and factors influencing health status and contact with health services. We

922

combined all non-cancer, self-reported diseases into a single category (self-reported) as

923

well as all treatments and medications (medication). We then extracted GWAS

924

association results for variants that were not tagged as low confidence variants, had

925

significant deltaSVM effects, and mapped in TMPRSS2-linked aging-related sites. From

926

these variants, we removed one (rs199938061) which was in perfect linkage

927

disequilibrium with another variant.

928
929

Deconvoluting the TMPRSS2 lung eQTL

930

We used MuSiC (v.0.1.1) (Wang et al., 2019) to estimate the proportions of lung cell

931

types with >500 cells from our scRNA-seq dataset in lung bulk RNA-seq samples from

932

the GTEx v8 release (Aguet et al., 2019). We combined cell type labels for capillary (distal

933

and proximal), macrophages (M1 and M2), matrix fibroblasts (1 and 2), and NK/T cells.

934

We modeled the relationship between TMM-normalized TMPRSS2 expression as a

935

function of the interaction between genotype and cell type proportion, while considering

936

the covariates used in the original GTEx data including sex, sequencing platform, PCR,

937

5 genotype PCs, and 59 inferred PCs from the expression data. From the original inferred

938

PCs, we excluded inferred PC 1 because it was highly correlated with AT2 cell type

939

proportion (Spearman ρ=0.67).
