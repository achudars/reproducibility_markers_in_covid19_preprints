Abstract

Intramuscular injection of DNA vectors expressing the extracellular vesicle (EV)-anchoring protein
Nef

mut

fused at its C-terminus to viral and tumor antigens elicits a potent, effective, and anti-tolerogenic

+

CD8 T cell immunity against the heterologous antigen. The immune response is induced through the
production of EVs incorporating Nefmut-derivatives released by muscle cells. In the perspective to a
possible translation into the clinic of the Nefmut-based vaccine platform, we aimed at increasing its safety
profile by identifying the minimal part of Nefmut retaining the EV-anchoring protein property. We found
that a C-terminal deletion of 29-amino acids did not affect the ability of Nefmut to associate with EVs.
Furthermore, the EV-anchoring function was preserved when antigens from both HPV16 (i.e., E6 and E7)
and SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., S1 and S2) were fused to its C-terminus. By analyzing the immune responses
induced after intramuscular injection of DNA vectors expressing fusion products based on the four viral
antigens, we found that the Nefmut C-terminal deletion did not impact on the levels of antigen –specific
CD8+ T lymphocytes as evaluated by IFN-γ EliSpot analysis and intracellular cytokine staining. In
addition, immune responses at distal sites remained unaffected, as indicated by the similar percentages of
SARS-CoV-2 S1- and S2- specific CD8+ T cells detected in spleens and lung airways of mice injected
with DNA vectors expressing the viral antigens fused with either Nefmut or NefmutPL.
We concluded that the C-terminal Nefmut truncation does not affect stability, EV-anchoring, and
CD8+ T cell immunogenicity of the fused antigen. Hence, NefmutPL represents a safer alternative to fulllength Nefmut for the design of CD8+ T cell vaccines for humans.

Introduction
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are classified as apoptotic bodies (1-5 m), microvesicles (50-1,000
nm), and exosomes (50-200 nm) (1). Microvesicles (also referred to as ectosomes) shed by plasma
membrane, whereas exosomes are released after inward invagination of endosome membranes and formation
of intraluminal vesicles. Exosomes are secreted by all cell types and are an important mean of intercellular
communication by transporting their cargo, such as DNAs, RNAs, proteins, and lipids, from the producer
cell to the recipient one (2). Healthy cells constitutively release both exosomes and microvesicles, together
referred to as EVs hereinafter.
Nefmut is a Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 protein mutant defective for all anti-cellular Nef
functions including CD4 and MHC Class I down-regulation, increased HIV-1 infectivity, and
p21 activated kinases (PAK)-2 activation (3). We previously described the high efficiency of HIV-1 Nefmut
of uploading into EVs released by multiple cell types (4). The efficiency of Nefmut incorporation into EVs is
maintained also when a foreign protein is fused to its C-terminus (5-7). When DNA vectors expressing
Nefmut-based fusion proteins are intramuscularly (i.m.) injected in mice, significant quantities of the fusion
proteins are packed into EVs while not altering their spontaneous release from muscle tissue. These in vivo
engineered EVs can freely circulate into the body, and internalized by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) which
cross-present EV contents to activate antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. These events result in the induction of
potent antigen-specific CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) responses (6-8). Effectiveness and flexibility of
this vaccine platform have been demonstrated with an array of viral products of various origins and sizes
including but not limited to: Human Papilloma virus (HPV)16-E6 and -E7; Severe acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 S1, S2, M, and N; Ebola Virus VP24, VP40 and NP; Hepatitis C
Virus NS3; West Nile Virus NS3; and Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever NP (7).
To maximize the safety profile of the Nefmut-based immunogens, we tried to identify the minimum
part of Nefmut still retaining in full the efficiency of EV-anchoring protein and the associated EV
immunogenicity. Investigations were carried out in the context of two viral systems recognizing quite
different pathogenic effects, i.e., HPV-16, whose infection can induce tumors, and the acute respiratory
disease-inducing SARS-CoV-2.
Pre-clinical studies already provided evidence that the Nefmut-based CTL vaccine platform can be
exploited as therapeutic intervention against HPV16-related and other malignancies (6, 9). The benefits
expected from a therapeutic cancer vaccine refer to the possibility to induce a de novo antitumor immunity as
well as widen both potency and breadth of pre-existing immunity (10). Cancer cells can express a multitude
of new antigens as result of their intrinsic genetic instability typical of malignant transformation and/or of the
expression of the etiologic cancer agents, as in the case of virus-induced malignancies, e.g., HPV and HBV.
In non-virus-induced cancers, transformed cells can produce antigens to which the host is basically tolerant
(tumor-associated self-antigens) as in the case of antigens expressed during fetal development (oncofetal
antigens), and overexpressed in specific tissues, e.g., HER2 in mammary glands. In addition, cancer cells
can express antigens to which the host does not develop tolerance, being however the immune response is

not effective enough to counteract the cancer cell growth. They include the so-called “tumor specific neoantigens” as well as antigens normally produced in immune-privileged tissues, as for cancer-testis antigens
(11). Hence, establishing a safe method to induce an adaptive immune response against both tolerogenic and
non-tolerogenic TAAs would be of great relevance for the design of novel antitumor therapeutic approaches.
Previous work demonstrated the role of specific CD8+ T cell immunity in attenuating the disease
induced by influenza virus (12, 13). Similarly, both experimental and clinical evidences supported the idea
that a SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell immunity can be instrumental to at least strongly mitigate the
symptoms related to the viral spread in both upper and lower airways (14-16). Data from experimental
infections in rhesus macaques indicated that the virus-specific CD8+ T cell immunity is critical to protect the
animals from virus re-challenge after the rapid decay of neutralizing antibodies (17). Consistently, induction
of antiviral CD8+ T cells was associated with a strongly reduced severity of the disease in humans (18).
Furthermore, the demonstrated ability of SARS-CoV-2 to spread through cell-to-cell contact (19) implies the
necessity to induce a robust cellular immunity to contain and clear the virus. In this context, the development
of novel preventive strategies focused on the induction of anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cell immunity would be
considered of relevance.
The Nefmut-based CTL vaccine platform has been already proven to be a candidate for both antiviral
and antitumor vaccines. In this perspective, optimization of the safety profile of Nefmut-based immunogens is
mandatory. This aim can be pursued, for instance, by removing unnecessary sequences from the anchoring
protein. Here, we provide evidence that both EV-incorporation efficiency and immunogenicity of foreign
antigens are conserved in the presence of a C-terminal 29 amino acid deletion of Nefmut.

Materials and Methods

DNA vector synthesis
The pTargeT (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) Nefmut and Nefmutfusion vectors were already
described (5, 6). The pTargeT-Nefmut/E6 vector comprised an E6 ORF which was codon optimized through
an ad hoc algorithm provided by Codon Optimization On-Line (COOL) service (https://cool.syncti.org)
which introduced 134 base substitutions. In addition, the G130V amino acid substitution generated a loss-offunction of E6 by hindering its interaction with the p53 cell protein partner (20). The E6 ORF was inserted in
Apa I/Sal I sites of the pTargeT- Nefmutfusion vector. The pTargeT-Nefmut/E7 vector was obtained through a
similar strategy. The E7 ORF was codon optimized through the introduction of 64 base substitutions as
described by Cid-Arregui and coll. (21). The protein was detoxified through the insertion of three amino acid
substitutions, namely three glycines at positions 21, 24, and 26, within the retinoblastoma protein (pRB)
binding site. In this way, the E7-specific immortalizing activity was abrogated (21).
The pTargeT-NefmutPL vector was obtained starting from the vector pTargeT-Nefmut. It was digested
with Sma I which cuts just downstream to the most C-terminal typical Nefmut mutation (i.e., E177G), and at

the 3’ end of vector polylinker. The subsequent re-ligation generated a C-terminal 29 amino acid deletion,
with a de novo formation of a stop codon just downstream the Sma I restriction site.
To obtain the pTargeT Nefmut-PL-based DNA vectors, an intermediate construct referred to as
NefmutPLfusion was obtained. To this aim, the NefmutPL ORF from pTargeT-NefmutPL was PCR amplified
using a forward primer tagged with a Nhe I restriction site, and a reverse primer including an Apa I site as
well as the overlapping sequence for a GPGP linker. The PCR product was then inserted in the
corresponding sites of pTargeT vector. In this way, the insertion in the unique Apa I restriction site of
downstream ORFs resulted in an in-frame sequence. To obtain the pTarget-NefmutPL/E6 and pTargetNefmutPL/E7 vectors, synthesis and cloning strategy were identical to that described for the DNA vectors
expressing the full-length Nefmut.
Both Nefmut/SARS-CoV-2-based fusion proteins were cloned into the pVAX1 plasmid (Thermo
Fisher) as already described (22). Both pVAX1-Nefmut and pVAX1-NefmutPL vectors were obtained by
inserting the respective ORFs in Nhe I and Eco RI sites of the vector polylinker. To obtain pVAX1 vectors
expressing NefmutPL fused with either SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 ORFs, an intermediate construct referred to
as pVAX1-NefmutPLfusion was obtained. To this aim, the NefmutPL ORF from pTargeT-NefmutPL was PCR
amplified using a forward primer tagged with a Nhe I restriction site, and a reverse primer including an Apa I
as well as the overlapping sequence for a GPGP linker, and inserted in the corresponding sites of pVAX1
vector. In this way, the downstream insertion of S1 and S2 ORFs in Apa I and Pme I restriction sites resulted
in in-frame sequences, and, upon translation, in NefmutPL-based fusion proteins. Gene synthesis were carried
out by Eurofins Genomics and Explora Biotech.

Cell cultures and transfection
Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293T cells (ATCC, CRL-11268) were grown in DMEM (Gibco)
plus 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco). Transfection assays were performed using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

EV isolation
Cells transfected with vectors expressing the Nefmut-based fusion proteins were washed 24 h later, and
reseeded in medium supplemented with EV-deprived FCS. The supernatants were harvested from 48 to 72 h
after transfection. EVs were recovered through differential centrifugations (23) by centrifuging
supernatants at 500×g for 10 min, and then at 10,000×g for 30 min. Supernatants were harvested,
filtered with 0.22 m pore size filters, and ultracentrifuged at 70,000×g for l h. Pelleted vesicles were
resuspended in 1×PBS, and ultracentrifuged again at 70,000×g for 1 h. Afterwards, pellets containing
EVs were resuspended in 1:100 of the initial volume.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analyses of both cell lysates and EVs were carried out after resolving samples in 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In brief, the analysis on cell
lysates was performed by washing cells twice with 1×PBS (pH 7.4) and lysing them with 1x SDS-PAGE
sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred by electroblotting on a 0.45 μM pore
size nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham) overnight using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot. For western blot analysis
of EVs, they were lysed and analyzed as described for cell lysates. For immunoassays, membranes were
blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature, then
incubated overnight at 4 °C with specific antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Filters
were revealed using 1:1,000-diluted sheep anti-Nef antiserum ARP 444 (MHRC, London, UK), 1:500diluted anti--actin AC-74 mAb from Sigma, and 1:500 diluted anti-Alix H-270 polyclonal Abs from Santa
Cruz.

Mice immunization
Both 6-weeks old C57 Bl/6 and, for Nefmut/S2 immunizations (in view of the lack of already
characterized H2b immunodominant S2 epitopes), Balb/c female mice were obtained from Charles River.
They were hosted at the Central Animal Facility of the Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS), as approved by the
Italian Ministry of Health, authorization n. 565/2020 released on June, 3, 2020. Preparations of DNA vector
were diluted in 30 L of sterile 0.9% saline solution. Both quality and quantity of the DNA preparations
were checked by 260/280 nm absorbance and electrophoresis assays. Each inoculum volume was injected
into both quadriceps. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane as prescribed in the Ministry authorization..
Immediately after inoculation, mice underwent electroporation at the site of injection through the Agilpulse
BTX device using a 4-needle array 4 mm gap, 5 mm needle length, with the following parameters: 1 pulse of
450 V for 50 µsec; 0.2 msec interval; 1 pulse of 450 V for 50 µsec; 50 msec interval; 8 pulses of 110 V for
10 msec with 20 msec intervals. The same procedure was repeated for both quadriceps of each mouse.
Immunizations were repeated after 14 days. Fourteen days after the second immunization, mice were
sacrificed by either cervical dislocation or CO2 inhalation.

Cell isolation from immunized mice
Spleens were explanted by qualified personnel of the ISS Central Animal Facility, and placed into a
2 mL Eppendorf tubes filled with 1 mL of RPMI 1640 (Gibco), 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Spleens
were transferred into a 60 mm Petri dish containing 2 mL of RPMI 1640 (Gibco), 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol
(Sigma). Splenocytes were extracted by incising the spleen with sterile scissors and pressing the cells out of
the spleen sac with the plunger seal of a 1 mL syringe. After addition of 2 mL of RPMI medium, cells were
transferred into a 15 mL conical tube and the Petri plate was washed with 4 mL of medium to collect the
remaining cells. After a three-minute sedimentation, splenocytes were transferred to a new sterile tube to
remove cell/tissue debris. Counts of live cells were carried out by the trypan blue exclusion method. Fresh

splenocytes was resuspended in RPMI complete medium, containing 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol and 10%
FBS, and tested by IFN-γ EliSpot assay.
For bronchoalveolar lavages, mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation, placed on their back, and
dampened with 70% ethanol. Neck skin was opened to the muscles by scissors, and muscles around the neck
and salivary glands were gently pulled aside with forceps to expose the trachea. A 15 cm long surgical thread
was then placed around the trachea and a small hole was cut by fine point scissors between two cartilage
rings. A 22 G × 1” Exel Safelet Catheter was carefully inserted about 0.5 cm into the hole, and then the
catheter and the trachea were firmly tied together with the suture. A 1 mL syringe was loaded with 1 mL of
cold PBS and connected to the catheter. The buffered solution was gently injected into the lung and aspirated
while massaging mouse torax. Lavage fluid was tranferred to a 15 mL conical tube on ice, and lavage
repeated two more times (24, 25). Total lavage volume was approximately 2.5 mL/mouse. Cells were
recovered by centrifugation, resuspeded in cell culture medium, and counted.
IFN- EliSpot analysis
A total of 2.5×105 live cells were seeded in each microwell. Cultures were run in triplicate in
EliSpot multiwell plates (Millipore, cat n. MSPS4510) pre-coated with the AN18 mAb against mouse IFN-γ
(Mabtech) in RPMI 1640 (Gibco), 10% FCS, 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) for 16 h in the presence of 5
µg/mL of the following CD8-specific peptides: E6 (H2-Kb): 18-26: KLPQLCTEL (27); 50-57: YDFAFRDL
(27); 109-117: RCINCQKPL (28); 127-135: DKKQRFMNI (27). HPV-16 E7 (H2-Kb): 49-57 RAHYNIVTF
(27); 67-75 LCVQSTHVD (28). SARS-CoV-2 S1 (H2-Kb): 525-531 VNFNFNGL (29); SARS-CoV-2 S2
(H2-Kd): 1079-1089 PAICHDGKAH (30). As a negative control, 5 µg/mL of either H2-Kb or H2-Kdbinding peptides were used. More than 70% pure preparations of the peptides were obtained from both
UFPeptides, Ferrara, Italy, and JPT, Berlin, Germany. For cell activation control, cultures were treated with
10 ng/mL PMA (Sigma) plus 500 ng/mL of ionomycin (Sigma). After 16 hours. cultures were removed, and
wells incubated with 100 µL of 1 µg/ml of the R4-6A2 biotinylated anti-IFN-γ (Mabtech) for 2 hours at r.t.
Wells were then washed and treated for 1 hour at r.t. with 1:1000 diluted streptavidine-ALP preparations
from Mabtech. After washing, spots were developed by adding 100 µL/well of SigmaFast BCIP/NBT, Cat.
N. B5655. The spot-forming cells were finally analyzed and counted using an AELVIS EliSpot reader.

Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS)
Splenocytes were seeded at 2×106/mL in RPMI medium, 10% FCS, 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol
(Sigma), and 1 g/mL brefeldin A (BD Biosciences). Control conditions were carried out either by adding 10
ng/ml PMA (Sigma) and 1 g/mL ionomycin (Sigma), or with unrelated peptides. After 16 hours, cultures
were stained with 1 l of LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell reagent (Invitrogen ThermoFisher) in 1 mL
of PBS for 30 minutes at 4 °C and washed twice with 500 l of PBS. To minimize nonspecific staining, cells
were pre-incubated with 0.5 g of Fc blocking mAbs (i.e., anti-CD16/CD32 antibodies,
Invitrogen/eBioscience) in 100 L of PBS with 2% FCS for 15 minutes at 4 °C. For the detection of cell

surface markers, cells were stained with 2 L of the following Abs: FITC conjugated anti-mouse CD3, APCCy7 conjugated anti-mouse CD8a, and PerCP conjugated anti-mouse CD4 (BD Biosciences) and incubated
for 1 hour at 4 °C. After washing, cells were permeabilized and fixed through the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD
Biosciences) as per the manufacturer’s recommendations, and stained for 1 hour at 4 °C with 2 l of the
following Abs: PE-Cy7 conjugated anti-mouse IFN- (BD Biosciences), PE conjugated anti-mouse IL-2
(Invitrogen eBioscience), and BV421 anti-mouse TNF- (BD Biosciences) in a total of 100 L of 1×
Perm/Wash Buffer (BD Biosciences). After two washes, cells were fixed in 200 L of 1× PBS/formaldehyde
(2% v/v). Samples were then assessed by a Gallios flow cytometer and analyzed using Kaluza software
(Beckman Coulter).
Gating strategy was as follows: live cells as detected by Aqua LIVE/DEAD Dye vs. FSC-A, singlet
cells from FSC-A vs. FSC-H (singlet 1) and SSC-A vs SSC-W (singlet 2), CD3 positive cells from CD3
(FITC) vs. SSC-A, CD8 or CD4 positive cells from CD8 (APC-Cy7) vs. CD4 (PerCP). The CD8+ cell
population was gated against APC-Cy7, PE, and BV421 to observe changes in IFN-, IL-2, and TNFproduction, respectively. Boolean gates were created in order to determine any cytokine co-expression
pattern.
Statistical analysis
When appropriate, data are presented as mean + standard deviation (SD). In some instances, the
Mann-Whitney U test was used. p<0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Design and EV-uploading of a C-terminal truncated Nefmut
The reduction of sequences of the EV-anchoring protein is expected to increase the safety profile of
the Nef

mut

CTL vaccine platform. We tried to identify the shortest Nefmut-related amino acid sequence still

retaining the ability to efficiently incorporate into EVs.
HIV-1 Nef is a 206 to 210 amino acid long protein recognizing a quite extended structured Nmoiety, and an unstructured C-terminal flexible region (31). To leave untouched the Nefmut secondary
structure which was assumed to be necessary for the EV-uploading activity, only isoforms deleted within its
unstructured C-terminus were considered. Another relevant constraint was represented by the most Cterminal unique amino acid mutation of Nefmut which maps at position 177, and whose presence was proven
to be mandatory to preserve its high efficiency of EV uploading. On this basis, a Nefmut protein truncated at
the amino acid 178, hence deprived of 29 C-terminal amino acids, was considered (Fig. 1).
Both cell accumulation and EV association of C-terminal truncated Nefmut (hereinafter referred to as
NefmutPL) compared to the full-length isoform were analyzed. To this aim, western blot analysis on lysates of
both transiently transfected HEK293T cells and EVs isolated from respective supernatants were carried out.

Representative results shown in fig. 2 indicated that Nefmut and NefmutPL accumulated into transfected cells
at similar extents, suggesting that the C-terminal truncation did not affect the protein stability. Most
important, NefmutPL associated with EVs at levels comparable to those of full-length Nefmut, indicating that
the presence of the 29 C-terminal amino acids is not essential for the uploading efficiency of Nefmut into EVs.
Intracellular expression and EV-uploading HPV16-E6 and -E7 fused with NefmutPL
Next, we tested the efficiency of EV-uploading of foreign proteins fused to NefmutPL compared to
parental Nefmut. To this aim, we considered both HPV16-E6 and –E7, which were already shown to be
uploaded in EVs upon fusion with full-length Nefmut (7, 32). The Nefmut-related sequences were fused with
either HPV16-E6 or - E7 ORFs which were optimized for translation in eukaryotic cells, and whose protein
domains involved in the respective pathogenic effects were inactivated. Steady-state levels in both
transfected cells and EVs isolated from the respective supernatants were evaluated by western blot analysis.
The E6-based fusion products accumulated in HEK293T transfected cells at similar levels, and the analysis
of EVs revealed that E6 efficiently associated with EVs also when fused with NefmutPL (Fig. 3A).
Consistently, E7 derivatives fused with either Nefmut or NefmutPL were expressed and uploaded in EVs at
similar extents (Fig. 3B).
We concluded that the presence of the C-terminal 29 amino acids of Nefmu is not essential for the
efficient EV-uploading of the HPV16 products fused to it.
Induction of HPV16-specific polyfunctional CD8+ T lymphocytes in mice immunized with DNA vectors
expressing NefmutPL/E6 and /E7
The induction of strong CTL immunity through the Nefmut-based platform against the heterologous
antigen implies the induction of antigen-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes co-expressing inflammatory Th-1
cytokines including IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α (i.e., polyfunctional CD8+ T lymphocytes). Next, we compared
the effectiveness of Nefmut to that of its truncated form in favoring the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune
response against the foreign antigen also in terms of induction of polyfunctional CD8+ T lymphocytes.
DNA vectors expressing HPV16-E6 and-E7 fused with either Nefmut or NefmutPL were injected in
mice. Fourteen days after the second immunization, IFN-γ EliSpot assays showed that all injected mice
responded in terms of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immunity (Fig. 4A). Overall, DNA vectors expressing
E7-derivatives induced stronger immune responses compared to E6-derivatives. On the other hand, the levels
of CD8+ T cell immune response in mice immunized with NefmutPL-based vectors appeared similar to those
detected after injection of DNA vectors expressing full-length Nefmut (Fig. 4A). Single-cytokine ICS analysis
showed that the percentages of E6/E7-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes expressing either IFN-γ, IL-2, or TNF-α
did not significantly change in the presence of Nefmut or NefmutPL. As an exception, increased percentages of
TNF-α expressing CD8+ T cells were observed from mice injected with DNA expressing NefmutPL/E6
compared to those immunized with Nefmut /E6 (Fig. 4B). Most important, the C-terminal truncation of Nefmut
did not affect the generation of antigen-specific, polyfunctional CD8+ T lymphocytes (fig. 4C).

We concluded that the effectiveness of the Nefmut-based vaccine platform in terms of anti-HPV16-E6
and –E7 immunogenicity remained largely unchanged when the anchoring protein was deleted of its 29 Cterminal amino acids.
Intracellular expression and EV-uploading of SARS-CoV-2 antigens fused with NefmutPL
Very recently we demonstrated that the Nefmut-based vaccine platform could be instrumental to
induce strong CD8+ T cell immunity against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens (22). The immune response was
detected in both spleens and lung airways. To establish whether these immunogenic properties were
preserved also in the presence of the Nefmut C-terminal truncation, we first evaluated the EV-uploading
efficiency of the fusion products. Investigations were carried out with both S1 and S2 SARS-CoV-2
antigens, which were proven to be the most immunogenic antigens in the context of the Nefmut vaccine
platform.
Intracellular expression of the fusion products were evaluated by transient transfection in HEK293T
cells, and the relative levels of uploading into EVs were scored upon their isolation from the supernatants.
Results from western blot assays indicated that S1 and S2 accumulated in cells at comparable extents when
fused with the two EV-anchoring proteins (Fig. 5). Most important, no evident differences in the levels of
EV-uploading were assessed (Fig. 5).
As already observed with HPV16 products, also in the case of SARS-CoV-2 antigens the efficiency
of EV uploading was not influenced by the Nefmut C-terminal truncation.
CD8+ T cell immunity induced in both spleen and lungs of mice injected with vectors expressing NefmutPLS1 and –S2
Both SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 were previously shown to induce a strong CD8+ T cell immunity in both
spleens and lung airways when expressed by a DNA vector as product of fusion with Nefmut (22). Next, we
compared the CD8+ T cell responses following the injection of DNA vectors expressing the two antigens
fused with either Nefmut or Nefmut-PL. Fourteen days after the second immunization, splenocytes were
isolated from injected mice, and cultured overnight in IFN-γ EliSpot microwells. Comparable antigenspecific CD8+ T cell activations were observed in splenocytes from mice inoculated with each vector
expressing the diverse fusion products, in the presence of a slight increase with vectors expressing fulllength Nefmut (Fig. 7A). On the other hand, the levels of immune responses measured in cells isolated from
bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) of injected mice appeared similar, in this case with a small increase
in cells from mice injected with NefmutPL-based vectors (Fig. 7B).
These data strongly supported the idea that the Nefmut C-terminus is dispensable for the induction of
SARS-CoV-2 specific immunity in spleens and, more striking, lung airways, i.e., the peripheral tissue
primarily involved in SARS-CoV-2-related pathogenesis. Hence, NefmutPL could be considered as an
effective and safe alternative to full-length Nefmut for anti-SARS-CoV-2 CTL vaccines based on the
technology of endogenously engineered EVs.

Discussion
The possibility to translate into the clinic the Nefmut-based CTL vaccine platform imposes the need to
identify and eliminate unnecessary sequences in both vectors and ORFs coding for the fusion products.
Concerning the DNA vector, we proved that Nefmut-based fusion antigens maintain unaltered their
immunogenic properties when expressed by the pVAX1 vector (22), i.e., a vector where prokaryotic
sequences are reduced compared to the more complex pTargeT vector we previously utilized. More
advanced, extremely small DNA vectors lacking antibiotic resistance (e.g., minicircle DNA vectors) would
represent an interesting alternative for translation into the clinic of the Nefmut-based vaccine platform (33).
On the other hand, the possibility to reduce the sequences required for the efficient EV-uploading was here
explored. Although we largely documented that Nefmut lacks all biologic activities of the wild-type
counterpart (3), it should be considered that its defectiveness relies on the co-existence of two amino acid
substitutions. Unpredictable, rare, however theoretically possible events of back-mutation might occur,
especially when the immunogenic DNA undergoes large-scale production and delivery. In this context,
possible anti-cellular effects due to back-mutations are expected to be strongly mitigated by the deletion of a
significant part of the protein. In particular, the 29 amino acid C-terminal region of Nef includes domains
involved in both signaling and trafficking functions typical of wt Nef (34). In the case of Nefmut, we found
that the truncation of a C-terminal region of 29 amino acids had no impact on both efficiency of EV
uploading and immunogenicity of diverse fusion products. This conclusion can be applied to any foreign
antigen, since it was drawn through the analysis of both small- and large-sized proteins from unrelated
viruses.
In some instance, our results can be considered unexpected since the Nef C-terminal region
comprises a well conserved cholesterol recognizing motif (CRM) already characterized as an important
domain for the association with the viral envelope (35). Considering the convergence in the biogenesis of
HIV-1 and EVs (36), this domain has the potential to play a role in the interaction of Nef with the
nanovesicles released by Nef-expressing cells. The CRM amino acid sequence, i.e., LHPEYYK in SF2-like
Nef alleles and LHPEYFK in HXB2-like ones, is well conserved among HIV-1 types B strains, including
that from which Nefmut originated, i.e., F12/HIV-1 (37). We hypothesized that the effects of both N-terminal
myristoylation and palmitoylation present in Nefmut, together with the stretch of basic amino acids located in
alpha helix 1 are prevalent over those induced by CRM in terms of stable interaction with lipid rafts of both
plasma and endosomal membranes.
Overall, the possibility to include NefmutPL sequences in DNA vectors candidates for new vaccine
strategies against infectious and tumor diseases significantly strengthens the safety profile of the EV-based
CTL vaccine platform.
