ABSTRACT
Heart dysfunction, represented by conditions such as myocarditis and arrhythmia, has
been reported in COVID-19 patients. Therapeutic strategies focused on the
cardiovascular system, however, remain scarce. The Sigma-1 receptor (S1R) has
been recently proposed as a therapeutic target because its inhibition reduces SARSCoV-2 replication. To investigate the role of S1R in SARS-CoV-2 infection in the heart,
we used human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCCM) as an experimental model. Here we show that the S1R antagonist NE-100
decreases SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral replication in hiPSC-CMs. Also, NE-100
reduces cytokine release and cell death associated with infection. Because S1R is
involved in cardiac physiology, we investigated the effects of NE-100 in cardiomyocyte
morphology and function. We show that NE-100 compromises cytoskeleton integrity
and reduces beating frequency, causing contractile impairment. These results show
that targeting S1R to challenge SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a useful therapeutic
strategy but its detrimental effects in vivo on cardiac function should not be ignored.

1. INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 is an airborne infectious disease caused by the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the first patients were
diagnosed with COVID-19, myocardial injury following SARS-CoV-2 infection has
been reported (C. Huang et al., 2020). Serious lung infection leading to respiratory
failure is the main cause of death (Gnecchi et al., 2020; L. Huang et al., 2020; Vincent
and Taccone, 2020). However, acute myocardial injury is also ranked as a cause of
SARS-CoV-2 infection-related fatalities; Shi and collaborators have shown that the inhospital mortality was increased (of 51.2%) in comparison to cases without cardiac
injury (of 4.5%) (Shi et al., 2020). Cardiovascular comorbidities are related to worse
outcomes and, together with diabetes, are the most current chronic conditions among
hospitalized COVID-19 patients (B. Li et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020).
SARS-CoV-2 was reported in the myocardial tissue (Lindner et al., 2020; Yao
et al., 2020). Whereas some autopsy studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infects
cardiomyocytes (Bulfamante et al., 2020), others indicated that the most likely targets
are interstitial or invading cells in the myocardium (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Lindner et
al., 2020). Therefore, it is not a consensus whether the myocardial disease is a direct
result of SARS-CoV-2 damage to cardiomyocytes or secondary to systemic events.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is reported as the main receptor
mediating SARS-CoV-2 cell entry (Scialo et al., 2020). ACE2 is expressed in many
organs including the heart, where it plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular function (Li,
2016; Lu et al., 2020; Patel et al., 2016; Shang et al., 2020). The number of ACE2positive cells and the expression of ACE2 itself are increased in failing hearts, which
could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection (Nicin et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). These
observations suggest an interplay between the cardiovascular system and
susceptibility to infection.
Analyzing the human embryonic heart, Yang and collaborators found that ACE2
is enriched in the cardiomyocyte subset of cells and argue that priming of the SARSCoV-2 Spike protein (SP) probably occurs through host cell cathepsins B and L (CTSB
and CTSL) (Yang et al., 2021). Following ACE2 receptor attachment, SARS-CoV-2
utilizes the CTSL-dependent endolysosomal route in human induced pluripotent stem

cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) (Pérez-Bermejo et al., 2020). The hiPSCCMs reproduce many key features of human myocardial cells and have been
recognized as useful tools to address SARS-CoV-2 heart infection in vitro and to test
drugs that may eventually prevent cardiac susceptibility (Choi et al., 2020; Marchiano
et al., 2020; Pérez-Bermejo et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2020).
Several compounds with antiviral activity have been proposed against SARSCoV-2 infection, especially from drug repurposing studies (Lovato et al., 2020;
Reznikov et al., 2020; Vela, 2020). Negative modulators of the Sigma-1 receptor (S1R)
gained considerable attention in SARS-CoV-2 infection because of its interaction with
non-structural protein 6 (NSP6) from SARS-CoV-2 (Gordon et al., 2020). S1R binds
ligands with very diverse structures from a wide spectrum of compounds and small
molecules (Su et al., 2010; Tesei et al., 2018). Experimental and approved drugs that
bind Sigma receptors with mild to high affinity, even as an off-target, have been
considered to prevent or treat COVID-19 (Reznikov et al., 2020; Vela, 2020). Several
of these compounds that inhibit S1R function have antiviral activity, including against
other coronaviruses, but cardiotoxicity and induction of arrhythmias were also reported
(Chen et al., 2006; Page et al., 2016).
On the other hand, apart from antiviral activity and participation in cardiac
function, S1R activation has also drawn attention for its potential anti-inflammatory
properties that could control the hyperinflammatory damage that follows severe SARSCoV-2 infection (Troncone, 2020). Recently, a randomized placebo-controlled clinical
trial showed that the S1R agonist fluvoxamine prevents clinical deterioration of
symptomatic COVID-19 patients (Lenze et al., 2020). Indeed, S1R activity is frequently
described as an inhibitory pathway of cytokine production via inositol-requiring enzyme
1-alpha (IRE1-α)(Rosen et al., 2019a). As a result of this downstream signaling, S1R
stimulation was demonstrated to protect mice from septic shock. As current evidence
shows that the outpouring of inflammatory cytokines at the late stages of critical
COVID-19 cases has a clear correlation with severity of symptoms and poor prognosis
(X. Li et al., 2020), is of utmost relevance to consider both antiviral and antiinflammatory approaches for potential drug candidates.
The modulation of S1R is in the spotlight of alternative pharmacological
approaches in COVID-19 but remains to be explored. In this study, we investigated

the role of S1R in SARS-CoV-2 infection of hiPSC-CMs. Inhibition of S1R reduced
SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral replication, preventing infection-associated cell death
and cytokine release. On the other hand, it led to aberrant changes in the cytoskeleton
and impaired cellular contraction. These results suggest that targeting S1R as a
strategy against COVID-19 should be considered carefully regarding possible adverse
cardiac outcomes.

2. RESULTS

2.1 Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs)
express the cardiac-specific troponin T and S1R

Human cardiomyocytes were differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) according to established protocols(Cruvinel et al., 2020). Differentiation to
cardiomyocytes resulted in a cell population with low expression of the pluripotency
marker OCT-4 (0.8% ± 0.4%) and most cells expressing the specific cardiac muscle
marker troponin T (cTnT) (88.4% ± 8.4%), as assessed by flow cytometry (Figure 1A).
The presence of cTnT was confirmed by immunostaining and cytoskeleton cell
morphology can be visualized by F-actin staining (Figure 1B). Sigma receptors are
known to be expressed in rat heart cells, especially the S1R subtype(Novakova et al.,
1995). Here, we showed S1R expression in human cardiomyocytes by western blot
(Figure 1C) and observed by immunostaining that S1R is widely spread within cells
with an enhanced signal in the perinuclear region and the nuclei (Figure 1D). This is
consistent with the cellular distribution of S1R in other cell types from rodents (Hayashi
and Su, 2003).

2.2 Inhibition of S1R reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in human
cardiomyocytes and prevents cell death
To inhibit S1R in hiPSC-CMs, cells were treated with the high-affinity S1R
antagonist NE-100, which has a very low affinity for other receptors such as dopamine,
serotonin, and phencyclidine receptors (Okuyama et al., 1993). NE-100 does not show
toxicity at concentrations ranging from 10 nM to 10 µM after 72 h (Supplemental
Figure 1 A). Also, hiPSC-CMs treated with 1 μM NE-100 for 48 h and 72 h showed no
significant changes in the number of pyknotic nuclei, which represents an irreversible
chromatin-condensed nuclear state characteristic of cell death (Supplemental Figure
1 B).
Following 24 h pretreatment with 1 μM NE-100, hiPSC-CMs were infected with
SARS-CoV-2 and the infection rate was evaluated at 48 hours post-infection (h.p.i).

patient showed that 57.3% (± 11.1%) of cells were infected at 48 h.p.i (Figure 2A).
We confirmed that CS-staining mostly co-localizes with the specific SARS-CoV-2
Spike Protein (SP) (Supplemental Figure 2). Importantly, S1R inhibition reduced the
percentage of infected hiPSC-CMs to 35.8% (± 2.5%) (Figure 2A and B).
Infection of hiPSC-CMs with SARS-CoV-2 led to the production of infectious
virions as shown in Figure 2C. Exposure to NE-100 significantly diminished viral yield,
with an average reduction of 82% at 48 h.p.i (Figure 2C). SARS-CoV-2 infection was
shown to induce cytopathic features in hiPSC-CMs, mostly related to myofibrillar
disruption and sarcomeric fragmentation, as described by Pérez-Bermejo and
collaborators (Pérez-Bermejo et al., 2020). Likewise, we detected a pattern of
fragmentation at 48 h.p.i, as shown in Supplemental Figure 3 with cardiac TnT
staining.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was evaluated in hiPSC-CM cultures
and confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes cardiomyocyte death, as previously
reported (Sharma et al., 2020). At 24, 48 and 72 h.p.i, LDH levels in cell supernatants
were elevated in SARS-CoV-2-infected conditions when compared to mock controls
by 2.3, 5.6 and 2.7-fold respectively (Figure 2D). NE-100 significantly decreases LDH
leakage at 48 and 72 h.p.i (Figure 2D). These results suggest that the inhibition of
S1R may prevent hiPSC-CMs death by decreasing susceptibility to infection.

in at least three independent experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001.

Since S1R is engaged in ER protein synthesis and acts as chaperone for
proteins translocating to cell surface (Vela, 2020), we investigated whether S1R
inhibition could be related to modifications of the host cell receptor for viral entry. To
that end, the expression of ACE2 was evaluated after a 24 h treatment with 1 µM of
S1R antagonist NE-100. We observed a reduction in the levels of ACE2 mRNA, not
statistically significant (P=0.0790) (Supplemental Figure 4A). Western blot analysis
of ACE2 after NE-100 treatment did not show differences at the protein level
(Supplemental Figures 4B and C). These data suggest that the inhibition of SARSCoV-2 infection in hiPSC-CMs can occur through mechanisms other than a reduction
in the availability of ACE2 under the above described NE-100 exposure.
2.3 S1R inhibitor NE-100 attenuates cytokine release in SARS-CoV-2 infected
hiPSC-CMs
Cell death is probably the final denouement to hiPSC-CMs at 72 h.p.i (Sharma
et al., 2020). To investigate early events before cell death, we analyzed the levels of
some of the main cytokines associated with COVID-19 at 24 and 48 h.p.i. We found
that SARS-CoV-2 infection increased the release of interleukin (IL)-6 when compared
to control. NE-100 decreased the release of interleukin (IL-6) at 24 h.p.i (Figure 3A).
At 48 h.p.i, IL-6 increased 4-fold in comparison to control. Similarly, NE-100 decreased
the release of IL-6 (Figure 3B).
No distinctly clear differences in the IL-8 secretion pattern were apparent at 24
h.p.i (Figure 3A). However, at 48 h.p.i, SARS-CoV-2 increased IL-8 amount by 5.5fold relative to mock condition (Figure 3B). Comparably to the modulation of IL-6
levels, NE-100 robustly decreased IL-8 secretion (Figure 3B). Tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNF-α) was also measured and found increased only at 24 h.p.i (3.3-fold), when
the NE-100 treatment restored secretion to similar levels of control condition (Figure
3A), while no significant changes were observed at 48 h.p.i (Figure 3B).

2.4 S1R inhibition disrupts cytoskeleton architecture and contractility of human
cardiomyocytes
One of the main features displayed by cultured cardiomyocytes is their ability
to perform spontaneous contractions (Belostotskaya and Golovanova, 2014). In that
matter, hiPSC-CMs were proved to be a suitable model to evaluate drug-induced
changes in contractility (Niehoff et al., 2019; Pointon et al., 2015). We observed a

decrease from 17.7 (± 5.9) beats per minute (bpm) to 6.7 (± 1.8) bpm and from 14.7
(± 2.8) bpm to 4.1 (± 0.8) bpm after 24 h and 48 h of NE-100 exposure, respectively
(Figure 4A and Supplemental videos). These results suggest that the inhibition of
S1R leads to contractile impairment and a putative functional collapse.
S1R plays a cardioprotective role during maladaptive cardiac remodeling and
the anti-hypertrophic properties of S1R agonists have been extensively described
(Hirano et al., 2014; Tagashira et al., 2013; Tagashira and Fukunaga, 2012).
Therefore, we also investigated if the S1R antagonist NE-100 alone could induce a
hypertrophic response that could lead to contractile machinery overload and beating
frequency reduction. To that end, we evaluated gene expression upon S1R inhibition,
measuring mRNA levels of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which is one of the main
transcripts of the fetal program for cardiac growth. ANP overexpression is frequently
correlated to cardiac hypertrophy and NE-100 decreased mRNA expression of ANP
by 1.49-fold after 24 h (Figure 4B). Next, we evaluated cell size and no increase in
the average cell surface area of hiPSC-CMs was observed by F-actin staining. In fact,
NE-100 exposure decreased the average cell surface area after 48 h (Figure 4C),
which is a phenotype opposite to the expected for cardiomyocyte hypertrophic
responses in vitro (Watkins et al., 2012).
We then hypothesized that the reduction in beating frequency could be related
to cell shrinking and attributed to morphological changes induced by S1R inhibition.
Analysis of cardiac troponin (cTnT) staining revealed a significant decrease both in
cTnT immunoreactive area and fluorescence intensity of hiPSC-CMs exposed to NE100 when compared to untreated controls (Figure 4D and E, respectively). These
results are probably attributable also to a decrease in cellular cTnT content rather than
exclusively to a change in cell area, indicating a noticeable loss of troponin. In addition,
the integrity of cytoskeletal fibers was grossly affected, as shown in confocal
fluorescence images (Figure 4F).

average ± S.E.M from at least three independent assays. *p<0.05; **p<0.01

Since there are changes in the cytoarchitecture, but not in cell toxicity or
hypertrophy induction, we suggest that cytoskeleton disruption is the most likely cause
for contractile collapse of hiPSC-CMs induced by S1R inhibition.

3. DISCUSSION
In this study, we show that hiPSC-CMs are permissive to a SARS-CoV-2
productive infection, corroborating previous results and validating this model to study
COVID-19 cardiac pathology in vitro (Bojkova et al., 2020; Bulfamante et al., 2020;
Choi et al., 2020; Marchiano et al., 2020; Pérez-Bermejo et al., 2020; Sharma et al.,
2020). Cell-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug screenings have been widely performed and
the hiPSC-CMs approach is improving rapidly so that it can support the prediction of
cardiac side effects at early preclinical steps of drug development (Chaudhari et al.,
2016; Mirabelli et al., 2020; Yiangou et al., 2020).
We described that S1R inhibition with the high-affinity antagonist NE-100
decreases the number of SARS-CoV-2-infected hiPSC-CMs by 21.5% and viral yield
by 82% at 48h.p.i. Sharma and colleagues previously described increased cell death
through apoptosis in hiPSC-CMs after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Sharma et al., 2020).
Here, we confirmed the cytotoxic effect of the virus providing evidence to support that
direct damage to cardiomyocytes follows SARS-CoV-2 infection and could be related
to cardiac injury in COVID-19.
Broader time point analyses are still needed to rule out an ACE2-dependent
inhibition of infection by S1R antagonism. However, there is no description of direct
interaction between S1R and host proteins involved in SARS-CoV-2 attachment or
viral envelope proteins (Vela, 2020).

Moreover, the assumption of a blockage

mechanism after cell entry is in agreement with the SARS-CoV-2–human protein
interaction map based on proteomics analysis, whereupon SARS-CoV-2 NSP6,
located at the ER, interacts directly with human S1R (Gordon et al., 2020). During the
replication of mammalian coronaviruses, this viral protein orchestrates vesicle
trafficking and regulates ER remodeling (Cottam et al., 2011; J Alsaadi and Jones,
2019). This close relationship with S1R could be related to its activity in the

rearrangement of endomembrane compartments and trafficking to favor steps of the
replication of SARS-CoV-2 (Gordon et al., 2020; Santerre et al., 2020).
Gordon and colleagues assessed the antiviral activity of sigma receptor ligands
in Vero E6 cells, which are highly permissive to infection. The authors described that
those with antagonist action reduced viral infectivity by targeting replication (Gordon
et al., 2020). Moreover, they reported that the S1R agonist dextromethorphan had
proviral activity. Herein, we provide evidence to support that this is also true for human
cardiac cells in vitro. Interestingly, compounds believed to protect from SARS-CoV-2
infection that are currently undergoing clinical trials, such as chloroquine (phase 2
NCT04349371), have S1R as an off-target (Hirata et al., 2011).
S1R is critical for early steps of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) RNA replication so that
its downregulation decreases susceptibility to infection in the hepatocyte-derived
carcinoma cell lineage Huh-7 (Friesland et al., 2013). A hallmark of these positivesense single-stranded RNA viruses, such as HCV and SARS-CoV-2, is that replication
occurs inside modified membranes derived from the ER, where S1R is mostly
expressed (Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008; Mori et al., 2013; Ritzenthaler and
Elamawi, 2006). Approved drugs with antiviral activity against HCV replication have
been demonstrated to be potential repurposed compounds to fight SARS-CoV-2
infection in vitro (Sacramento et al., 2020). Notably, remdesivir, which is an efficient
antiviral drug against HCV, was approved for emergency treatment of COVID-19
patients requiring hospitalization (Eastman et al., 2020). Remdesivir anti-SARS-CoV2 activity in human cardiomyocytes was described by Choi and colleagues, together
with a safety profile evaluation that stipulated considerable arrhythmogenic and
cardiotoxic risk in vitro, raising the concern of drug-induced cardiotoxicity of
repositioned pre-approved compounds to manage COVID-19 (Choi et al., 2020).
Aside from viral infection and replication, the immune-mediated mechanisms
are a hallmark of COVID-19 pathology and associated cardiac deterioration that can
be successfully modeled using hiPSC-CMs (Azkur et al., 2020; Dariolli et al., 2021).
Along with monocytes and fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes are also an important source
of cytokines during events such as heart failure (Aoyagi and Matsui, 2012). Here, we
showed that IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α release is stimulated in hiPSC-CMs in response to
SARS-CoV-2 infection, complementing previous data on increased mRNA levels of
these cytokines (Wong et al., 2020). Elevated levels of IL-6 are strongly correlated
with cardiac damage and heart failure in rodent models (Janssen et al., 2005; Jug et
12

al., 2009). Moreover, previous reports demonstrated that IL-6 produced in
cardiomyocytes promotes inflammation in the heart by recruiting neutrophils (Youker
et al., 1992). Interestingly, IL-8, which was also found increased, is a neutrophil
chemotactic factor correlated with chronic heart failure, coronary heart disease and
myocardial apoptosis (Akasaka et al., 2006; Nymo et al., 2014; Rothenbacher et al.,
2006). Indeed, myocardial infiltration of neutrophils has been reported in the hearts of
COVID-19 patients and is believed to be a key mechanism behind myocardial damage
(Yao et al., 2020).
The consequences of infection to cardiomyocytes are just beginning to be
unraveled in vitro and should help to better understand COVID-19 heart pathology and
its crosstalk with systemic events of disease progression. Our results suggest that
immunopathological mechanisms probably underlie myocardial injury following SARSCoV-2 infection and that cardiomyocytes could also play a role in the excessive
systemic release of cytokines observed in the late stages of COVID-19. Interestingly,
S1R inhibition with NE-100 attenuated the cytokine release following SARS-CoV-2
infection. However, the anti-inflammatory role promoted by S1R activation in the
control of septic shock and its immunomodulatory activity during infections by other
respiratory viruses, such as H1N1 influenza virus, have been well described (Rosen
et al., 2019b; Szabo et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2019). Therefore, the effect observed in
this work is more likely to be due to the inhibition of infection than a direct effect on
cytokine production.
Although S1R antagonism was an efficient mechanism to diminish SARS-CoV2 infection and associated cell-death and cytokine release, there are reasons to
believe that such inhibition could be detrimental to cardiac physiology (Shinoda et al.,
2016b, 2016a). Also, as COVID-19 patients are expected to present cardiac
dysfunctions (Magadum and Kishore, 2020; Wu et al., 2020), the use of drugs with
potential cardiac negative effects could be unfeasible as a therapeutic approach.
Notwithstanding, the cell survival rate was not affected, and neither the
characteristic hypertrophic gene expression profile nor enlargement of cell body sizes
was detected after NE-100 exposure. Our findings show that inhibition of S1R
significantly reduced beating frequency in hiPSC-CMs and completely compromised
cell morphology with a conspicuous perturbation of cytoskeletal architecture and
decrease in cardiac troponin staining. Actin subunits are assembled into F-actin, which

serves as a platform for troponin-tropomyosin binding for proper sarcomere function
during contraction (Gunning et al., 2015). The integrity of actin and troponin fibers
dictates the mechanical stability necessary for proper force distribution at sarcomere
margins during contraction and appropriate anchorage between cytoskeletal proteins
and extracellular matrix (Gunning et al., 2015). The disruption of cytoskeletal and
sarcomeric proteins by a decrease in expression or anomalous arrangement could
underlie the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies and heart failure (Sequeira et al.,
2014).
It could be argued that hiPSC-CMs are too immature to reliably predict heart
response to NE-100. However, the S1R antagonist haloperidol was demonstrated to
prolong QT interval, deplete ATP production and cause shortening of action potentials
using cardiomyocytes from different sources, including adult rodents (Shinoda et al.,
2016a; Stracina et al., 2015; Tarabová et al., 2009). These observations were
consistent with the deterioration of heart function in animal models. Furthermore, S1R
knockout mice exhibit maladaptive morphological cardiac remodeling and thereafter
contractile dysfunction (Abdullah et al., 2018).
Further investigations are needed to determine whether NE-100 might induce
cardiotoxicity in vivo. However, it is hypothesized that the direct interaction between
S1R and the human Ether‐à‐go‐go Related Gene (hERG) voltage-gated potassium
channel could underlie the blockage of hERG function by S1R ligands, causing delays
in cardiac repolarization, impairment of rate adaptation and increased risk for druginduced arrhythmia (Balasuriya et al., 2014; Corbera et al., 2006; Crottès et al., 2011;
Eng et al., 2016; Hancox and Mitcheson, 2006; Morales-Lázaro et al., 2019; Witchel,
2011; Yu et al., 2015).
Besides cytoskeleton-sarcomere framework integrity, the contractile capacity of
cardiomyocytes is related to calcium availability (Van der Velden et al., 2003). As S1R
is a key regulator of intracellular calcium homeostasis, the possibility that blocking its
function could be hampering proper calcium cytoplasmic availability and impairing
contraction cannot be ruled out, since this was not evaluated at the present work.
However, the involvement of calcium intracellular concentration in S1R function in
cardiac cells is controversial. Despite the previously described interaction of S1R
inhibitors with L-type calcium channels in rat cardiomyocytes, the sensitivity of the
myofilaments to calcium ions was shown not to be changed, while beating frequency

variations followed by asymmetrical contractions were observed after exposure to S1R
antagonists (Ela et al., 1994; Tarabová et al., 2009).
S1R has been extensively studied regarding its vital role for physiological
cardiac function, amelioration of ER stress, and protection against maladaptive
hypertrophy that leads to heart failure (Bhuiyan and Fukunaga, 2009; Tagashira et al.,
2013; Tagashira and Fukunaga, 2012) but the role of S1R in human cardiomyocytes
remains poorly described. Here, we provide data about the involvement of S1R in
SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our in vitro results suggest that the inhibition of S1R as a
therapeutic strategy against COVID-19 should be further investigated and undergo
well-balanced decision-making when translated to clinical application, due to the
concern of possible drug-induced cardiac malfunction.

4. MATERIAL AND METHODS

4.1 hiPSC-CMs differentiation, purification, and maintenance
Fresh human iPSCs-derived cardiomyocytes were purchased from Pluricell
(São Paulo, Brazil) and the protocol for cardiomyocyte differentiation is described in
detail by Cruvinel and colleagues (Cruvinel et al., 2020). Briefly, hiPSCs were passed
and replated to be maintained in E8 medium with 5 µM of Y-27632 (Cayman Chemical,
USA) with daily changes of media. After 100% confluence was reached, cells were
kept in RPMI supplemented with B27 without insulin (both from Thermo Fisher, USA)
and with 4 µM CHIR99021 (Merck Millipore Sigma, USA) for one day. After 24 h, the
medium was supplemented with 10 ng/ml BMP4 (R&D Systems, USA) for an
additional 24 h. On day 2, fresh medium was supplemented with 2.5 µM KY2111 and
XAV939 (both from Cayman Chemical, USA). From day 4, cells were cultivated with
CDM3 media (RPMI supplemented with 213 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma Aldrich, USA),
500 μg/ml Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and 2 µg/ml Plasmocin (InvivoGen, USA). On
day 18, cells were passaged with TrypLE 10X and plated on a density of 0.9x104/well
or 1.8x104/well onto 96 or 24-well plates and maintained in CDM3 media. Upon arrival,
cardiomyocytes were allowed to regain contractility and maintained at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cardiomyocytes were used between days 30 to
40 of differentiation.

4.2 Chemicals
4-Methoxy-3-(2-phenylethoxy)-N,N-dipropylbenzeneethanamine hydrochloride
(NE-100 hydrochloride) was purchased from Tocris (3133). Stock and work solutions
were prepared using 100% dimethyl sulfoxide sterile-filtered (DMSO; D2650 - SigmaAldrich).

4.3 Flow Cytometry
Cardiomyocytes were plated on 6-well plates coated with GELTREX and
cultivated for 7 days. After cell dissociation, cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde
(PFA), permeabilized with Triton 0.1% (Sigma Aldrich) and Saponin 0.1% (Sigma
Aldrich), and stained with the antibodies anti-TNNT2 (1:2500; Thermo Fisher, MA512960) and anti-OCT4 (1:200, Thermo Fisher, MA5-14845). FC data was acquired
using a Canto BD flow cytometer for each batch of differentiation and analyzed using
the FlowJo Software considering 1%–2% of false-positive events.

4.4 SARS-CoV-2 propagation
SARS-CoV-2 was expanded in Vero E6 cells from an isolate obtained from a
nasopharyngeal swab of a confirmed case in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (GenBank
accession no. MT710714). Viral isolation was performed after a single passage in cell
culture in 150 cm2 flasks with high glucose DMEM plus 2% FBS. Observations for
cytopathic effects were performed daily and peaked 4 to 5 days after infection. All
procedures related to virus culture were handled in biosafety level 3 (BSL3) multi-user
facilities according to WHO guidelines. Virus titers were determined as plaque-forming
units (PFU/ml), and virus stocks were kept in -80°C ultra-low temperature freezers.
4.5 Infections and virus titration
Cardiomyocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI of 0.1 in CDM3 media
without serum. After 1 hour, cells were washed and incubated with complete medium
with treatments or not. For virus titration, monolayers of Vero E6 cells (2 x 104 cell/well)
in 96-well plates were infected with serial dilutions of supernatants containing SARSCoV-2 for 1 hour at 37°C. Semi-solid high glucose DMEM medium containing 2% FSB
and 2.4% carboxymethylcellulose was added and cultures were incubated for 3 days

at 37°C. Then, the cells were fixed with 10% formalin for 2 h at room temperature. The
cell monolayer was stained with 0.04% solution of crystal violet in 20% ethanol for 1
h. Plaque numbers were scored in at least 3 replicates per dilution by independent
readers blinded to the experimental group and the virus titers were determined by
plaque-forming units (PFU) per milliliter.

4.6 Immunocytochemistry and fluorescence image analysis
hiPSC-CMs grown on 96-well plates were fixed using 4% PFA solution (SigmaAldrich) for 1 h and stored at 4ºC until further processing. Cells were washed with 1X
PBS and then incubated with permeabilization/blocking solution (0.3% Triton X100/3% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking
solution and incubated at 4ºC overnight, namely anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent
serum from a recovered COVID-19 patient (1:1000); anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
monoclonal antibody (SP) (1:500, G632604 - Genetex); anti-cardiac troponin T (cTnT)
(1:500, MA5-12960 - Invitrogen) and anti-Sigma1R B-5 (1:100, SC-137075 - Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). The use of the convalescent serum from COVID-19 patients was
approved by CAAE number: 30650420.4.1001.0008. Next, hiPSC-CMs were washed
3 times with PBS 1X and incubated with the secondary antibodies diluted in blocking
solution: goat anti-Human Alexa Fluor 647 (1:400; A-21445 - Invitrogen) and goat antiMouse Alexa Fluor 488 (1:400; A-11001 - Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature.
Actin filaments were stained with Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin (1:10; A-12380 - Life
Technologies) for 1 h. Nuclei were stained with 300 nM 4ʹ-6-diamino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) for 5 minutes and each well was mounted with two drops of 50% PBS-Glycerol
before image acquisition.
For quantitative analysis, images were acquired using Operetta ® High-Content
Screening System (Perkin Elmer) with a 20x long working distance (WD) objective
lens from at least 10 fields per well. For cell surface area measurement, images of Factin stained cardiomyocytes were segmented using Cellpose and the area was
measured using NIH ImageJ software (Stringer et al., 2021). For the other analyses,
data were evaluated using the Columbus™ Image Data Storage and Analysis System
(Perkin Elmer) for image segmentation and object detection. The fluorescence
threshold was set to determine positive and negative cells for each marker.

Representative immunostaining images were acquired on a Leica TCS-SP8 confocal
microscope using a 63x oil-immersion objective lens.

4.7 Measurements of cell death and inflammatory mediators
Monolayers of hiPSC-CMs in 96-well plates (70-90% confluence) were allowed
to regain contractility and then were treated with various concentrations of NE-100.
Neutral red (N4638 - Sigma-Aldrich) solution was prepared using ultrapure water and
centrifuged (600 g for 20 minutes) to remove precipitates of dye crystals. At 72 hours
post-treatment, media was removed, cells were washed once with PBS 1x and 200 μL
of neutral red working solution diluted in hiPSC-CMs medium was added to each well
at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. Cells were incubated for 3 h at 37ºC to allow
uptake of dye into viable cells. Thereafter, media was removed, and cells were washed
with PBS 1x followed by the addition of 1% acetic acid-49% ethanol revealing solution.
After additional 10 minutes at 37ºC and gently shaking, the absorbance was measured
in the microplate reader spectrophotometer Infinite® M200 PRO (Tecan) at a
wavelength of 540 nm. Surviving hiPSC-CMs were estimated by the percentage
relative to untreated condition (vehicle) using the mean of 6 technical replicates per
experiment.
The levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α were quantified in the supernatants from
uninfected and SARS-CoV-2-infected hiPSC-CMs by ELISA (R&D Systems), following
manufacturer’s instructions. Control groups (MOCK and cells infected with Sars-Cov2 only) were also analyzed in Aragao et al., 2021 (in preparation). The results were
obtained as picograms per milliliter (pg/ml) and are expressed as fold-change relative
to untreated uninfected control. Cell death of infected cardiomyocytes was determined
according to the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the culture supernatants
using a CytoTox® Kit (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Supernatants were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 1 minute, to remove cellular debris.

4.8 Gene expression analysis
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent from hiPSC-CMs pellets,
according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After,
total RNA was digested with DNase using DNase I, Amplification Grade, following the

manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific). DNase-treated RNA
samples (1 μg) were converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) using the M-MLV
enzyme (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The reactions to determine gene expression were conducted in three replicates
with a final reaction volume of 10 µL in MicroAmp Fast Optical 96 Well Reaction Plates
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 1X GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega
Corporation), 300 nM CXR Reference Dye, final concentration 200nM of each SYBR

and 10 ng of cDNA per reaction. Briefly, the reactions were performed on a
StepOnePlus ™ Real-Time PCR System thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). Thermal
cycling program comprised hold stage at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycling stages
at 95°C for 15 sec, 57°C for 15 sec, 72°C for 15 sec and melt curve stage 95 °C, 15
sec; 60 °C, 1 min; 95 °C, 15 sec. The relative expression of the genes of interest (GOI)
was normalized by endogenous control genes: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
Dehydrogenase (GAPDH; forward: 5’-GCCCTCAACGACCACTTTG-3’; reverse: 5’CCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG-3’) and Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyl transferase 1
(HPRT-1;

AGAGGGCTACAATGTGATGGC-3’). qPCR data analysis was performed with the N0
method implemented in LinRegPCR v. 2020.0 software, which considers qPCR mean
efficiencies estimated by the window-of-linearity method as proposed by Ramakers et
al. (2003) and Ruijter et al. (2009) (Ramakers et al., 2003; Ruijter et al., 2009). N0
values were calculated in LinRegPCR using default parameters and the arithmetic
mean of N0 values from GOI were normalized by taking its ratio to the N 0 of the
geometric mean of the endogenous control genes (REF) GAPDH and HRRT-1 (N0GOI
/N0REF).

4.9 Protein expression
Media was completely removed from hiPSC-CMs plated on 24-well plates, and
40µL of sample buffer without bromophenol blue (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8,

containing 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) was added to each
well. The lysate was frozen at -80°C until further processing. Next, cell extracts were
boiled at 95°C for 5 min, centrifuged 16,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatant
was collected. Protein content was estimated using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay
(#5000006, Bio-Rad). After the addition of bromophenol blue (0.02%), extract samples
were separated by electrophoresis on an 8% SDS polyacrylamide gel and transferred
to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes.
Western blotting was performed with minor modifications from the originally
described (Towbin et al., 1989). Briefly, membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk
diluted in Tris-Buffered Saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room
temperature. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary
antibodies (anti-ACE2 (1:1000; MA5-32307 - Thermo Fisher), anti-Sigma-1 R (1:500;
SC-137075 - Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-actin (1:2000, MAB1501, Millipore); or
anti-GAPDH (1:5000; AM4300 -Thermo Fisher) diluted in TBS-T with 5% non-fat milk.
Then, membranes were washed and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated antibodies
(goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L), HRP-conjugate (1:10,000, G21040 -Molecular Probes)
and Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) HRP- conjugate (1:10,000, G21234 - Molecular
Probes). The signals were developed using ECL Prime Western Blotting System
(#GERPN2232, Sigma) for 5 minutes and chemiluminescence was detected with an
Odyssey-FC System® (LI-COR Biosciences).
Stripping protocol was performed to break bonds between the antibodies and
the transferred proteins in order to reuse membranes. Briefly, membranes were
incubated for three cycles of 10 minutes in a stripping buffer (pH 2.2, 200 mM glycine,
SDS 0.1% and 1% Tween-20). Then, the buffer was discarded, the membranes were
washed for 5 minutes with PBS (three times) and 5 minutes with 0.1% TBS-T (three
times). Next, membranes were blocked again and proceeded with the abovedescribed steps.
Densitometry analysis was performed using ImageJ software Gel Analysis
program and the values obtained represent the ratio of density between the
immunodetected protein and the loading control (actin or GAPDH).

4.10 Beating frequency evaluation
hiPSC-CMs were plated on 96-well plates (1.8x104 cells per well) and treated
with NE-100 1µM or vehicle (DMSO) before incubating at 37ºC. At 24- and 48-hours

post-treatment, beating frequency was measured by manually counting the
synchronous contractions of the monolayer for 60 seconds (beats per minute). Cells
were observed using an EVOS cell imaging system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), in
brightfield mode. Three wells at a time were counted and then the plates were replaced
for 5-10 minutes at the incubator and allowed to regain contractility before resuming
counting. Representative videos were recorded using Operetta® High-Content
Screening System (Perkin Elmer) for each condition at baseline and 48 h after
treatment with vehicle or NE-100
