ABSTRACT
Bats have been shown to serve as reservoir host of various viral agents including coronaviruses.
They have also been associated with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This has made them
an all important agent for CoV evolution and transmission. Our objective in this study was to
investigate the dispersal, phylogenomics and evolution of betacoronavirus (βCoV) among
African bats. We retrieved sequence data from established databases such as GenBank and
Virus Pathogen Resource, covering the partial RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene of
Bat coronaviruses from eight African, three Asian, five European, two South American countries
and Australia. We analyzed for Phylogeographic information relating to genetic diversity and
evolutionary dynamics. Our study revealed that majority of the African strains fell within
Norbecovirus subgenera, with an Evolutionary rate of 1.301 × 10-3, HPD (1.064 × 10-3 – 1.434 ×
10-3) subs/site/year. The African strains diversified into three main subgenera, Norbecovirus,
Hibecovirus and Marbecovirus. The time to most common recent ancestor for Norbecovirus
strains was 1968, and 2010, for the African Marbecovirus strains. There was evidence of inter
species transmission of Norbecovirus among bats in Cameroun and DRC. Phlylogeography
showed that there were inter-continental spread of Bt-CoV from Europe, China and Hong Kong
into Central and Southern Africa, highlighting the possibility of long distance transmission. Our
study has elucidated the possible evolutionary origins of βCoV among African bats, we therefore
advocate for broader studies of whole genome sequences of BtCoV to further understand the
drivers for their emergence and zoonotic spillovers into human population.
Key words: Phylogeography, Evolutionary dynamics, BtCoV, Africa

INTRODUCTION
Coranaviruses are a large group of enveloped, positive sense, single stranded RNA viruses
belonging to the order Nidovirales and family Coronaviridea [1]. The subfamily coronavirinae
contains four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and
Deltacoronavirus [1]. The international committee on the Taxonomy of viruses recently adopted
addition changes to the nomenclature of Coronaviruses to include the inclusion of subgenera
replacing the elsewhile lineage classification system [2]. Under this new system the genus
betacoronavirus was further classified into five subgenera Sarbecovirus, Marbecovirus,
Norbecovirus, Embecovirus and Hibecovirus [2]. Betacoronaviruses generally infect animals
such as mammals and birds, they are the causative agents of many pathogenic diseases such as
transmissible gastroenteritis of swine (TGEV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBD), mouse hepatitis
virus (MHV), and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) [3]. Coronavirus have been reported as early as
1930 (1Masters and Pearlman, 2013) but the earliest report of human coronavirus was in the year
1960, where two strains namely hCoV229-E and hCoVOC43 were described [4,5]. Generally
betacoranvirus have been observed to cause paucisymptomatic disease in man and are largely
known to be zoonotic. It was not until after the advent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong and parts of China in 2003, that studies into the zoonotic origin
of the incriminated pathogen SARS CoV revealed that the Chinese Rinolophid bats maintained a
genetically related strain of the SARS CoV, [6,7]. This finding sparked up interest in bat CoV
research. Another coronavirus termed Middle East severe respiratory syndrome virus (MERS
CoV) was reported in the Arabian peninsula in 2012 [8]. Genetically similar strains to the MERS
CoV were also isolated from Pipistellus, Tyloncteris and Neoromica bats [9].
In Africa large scale surveillance studies have identified diverse strains of coronavirus (CoV)
circulating among African bats from Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria [10]. Studies have also provided
evidence that the human coronavirus hCoV229E originated from African bat CoV (AfrBtCoV)
[11]. Also the rich fauna and biodiversity in Africa has made it a hotspot for emerging viral
diseases. It is also inhabited by a diversity of bats which have been identified to serve as a
reservoir of high consequence zoonotic diseases such as Marburg hemorrhagic fever and Rabies
[9]. Recently a novel coronavirus SARS CoV-2 was identified to be the cause of a gobal
pandemic which originally broke out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China [12]. Some studies have
also postulated that the SARS CoV-2 probably spilled over into human population through a
zoonotic event involving Chinese SARS-related BtCoV [12,13].

The recent evidence of African bats as a potential reservoir host for several betacoronaviruses
(βCoV) gave rise to the conceptualization of this study which aims to investigate the spatial
dispersal, phylogenomics and evolution of βCoV among African bats.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Collection
We searched for and downloaded partial or complete gene coding regions for the RNA
dependent RNA polymerase sequences (RdRP) of Afr-BtCoV from GeneBank and the Virus
Pathogen resource database http://www.viprbic.org , and Genbank. The data set generated
contained African bat βCoV from eight countries, namely Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Cameroun,
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Madagascar and South Africa (n=94), BtCoV
from China, Hong Kong and Philippines in Asia; and France, Spain, Netherland, Italy and
Luxemburg in Europe (n=95). Mexico and Brazil (n=3), Australia (n=1) and reference African
CoV OC43, CoVHKU1, MERSCoV, and alpha coronavirus from Africa (n=35). Information
such as country of origin, Host species, and date of collection were combined with the sequence
information for the purpose of accurate phylogenetic determination. The final data stets had
information from seven African countries, four European countries and three Asian countries.
All the data used in this study can be assessed in Supplementary Table 1. Majority of the African
BtCoV sequences were generated by nRT-PCR using primers targeting the 440bp partial RdRP
gene region [14] and Sanger sequencing. Full genome sequences of ZBCoV were generated by
both Sanger and ultra high throughput sequencing (UHTP) sequencing [15].
Phylogenetic analysis
Sequences were aligned using clustal W version 2.1 using default settings, the final alignment
was 400bp in length. Phylogenetic trees were constructed in MEGA 7.0 software
www.megasoftwre.net using the maximum likelihood method with a general time reversible
GTR with a gama distributed rate variation (T 4) and a p- distance model with 1000 bootstrap
resampling. The final trees were then visualized in fig tree
http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/.

Discrete Phylogeographic analysis
Aligned sequences were analyzed for evidence of sufficient temporal clock signal using TempEst
version 1.5 [16]. The relationship between root-to-tip divergence and sampling dates supported
the use of molecular clock analysis in this study. Phylogenetic trees were generated by Bayasian
inference through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), implemented in BEAST version 1.10.4
[17]. We partitioned the coding genes into first+second and third codon positions and applied a
separate Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY+G) substitution model with gamma-distributed rate

heterogeneity among sites to each partition [18]. Two clock models were initially evaluated strict
and relaxed molecular clock, with four different tree priors, constant population size, exponential
population size, Bayesian Skyride plot and Gausian Markov Random Field Skyride plot. Each
selected model was run for an initial 30, 000, 000 states. Models were compared using Bayes
factor with marginal likelihood estimated using the path sampling and stepping stone methods
implemented in BEAST version 1.10.4 [17]. The relaxed clock with Gausian Markov Random
Field Skyride plot (GMRF) coalescent prior was selected for the final analysis. The MCMC
chain was set at 100, 000, 000 states with10% as burn in. Results were visualized using Tracer
version 1.8. (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/), all effective sampling size ESS values
were >200 indicating sufficient sampling. Bayesian skyride analysis was carried out to visualize
the epidemic evolutionary history using Tracer v 1.8.
(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/).To reconstruct the ancestral-state phylogeographic
transmission across countries and hosts, we used the discrete-trait model implemented in BEAST
version 1.10.4 [17].The Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) approach [19]
was used to explore the most important historical dispersal routes for the spread BtCoV across
their countries of origin, as well as the most probable host-species transition. The spatiotemporal
viral diffusion was then visualized using the Spatial Phylogenetic Reconstruction of
Evolutionary Dynamics SPREAD3 software [20].

RESULTS AND DISCUSION
PHYLOGENY AND EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS
We analyzed βCoV sequences from seven African countries distributed among eight bat species
as shown in Table 1. The most abundant bat species sampled in this study was Micropteropus.
pussilus, and Cameroon had the highest distribution of bat species sampled in this study. This
result does not necessarily represent the true picture of bat species diversity in Africa, as some
countries lack sequence information for bats due lack of surveillance. Few studies have been
carried in Africa on CoV among bats leaving a huge gap in epidemiologic information regarding
BtβCoV in Africa.
Phylogenetic analysis of Bt-βCoV sequences revealed a significant proportion of the African
strains, isolated from fruit bats fell within the sub-genera Norbecovirus formerly known as
lineage D consisting of strains from Cameroon, DRC, Kenya, Madagascar and Nigeria. This
observation is in agreement with a previous report which identified the widespread circulation of
Norbecovirus (Lineage D) among fruit bats in certain African regions [21]. However, it was
identified that isolates consisting largely of strains isolated among Neomoricia South African
bats clustering within the sub-genus Marbecovirus (formerly Lineage C) together with strains
isolated from Italy and Spain (Figure 1). The phylogenetic classifications utilized in this study is
based on the partial RdrP group unit (RGU), utilized for the rapid classification of field isolates
of βCoV [22]. The species-specific phylogenetic clustering observed among the Neomoricia bats
suggests limited inter-species βCoV transmission and host specific evolution among these
species of bats in Africa as previously reported for BtCoV [23]. Larger epidemiological studies
are needed among these species of bats to shed more light as to the cause of this observed trend
in Africa. Studies have shown that βCoV of subgenera Marbecovirus such as MERSCoV are

capable of both intra-species transmission and inter host transmission [24]. In this study there
seemed to be inter-species transmission among the Norbercovirus (lineage D βCoV), evidenced
by circulation of same Norbecovirus clade within different species of bats from same country
around with the same year of isolation. For instance from Figure 2 it can be seen that
Cameroonian bat species Micropteropus pussilus, Epomophorus gambianus and Epomophorus
franquenti, were infected by the same Norbecovirus clade, isolated around the year 2013. This is
also observed among bat species from DRC (Figure 2).This type of event allows for potential
recombination and rapid evolution of this lineage, as previously reported [25]. This type of
observation was also reported in an earlier study of an inter-species transmission event of alpha
CoV HKU10 in bat species of different orders [26]. Results for root to tip divergence showed the
data set had a positive temporal signal (Supplementary Figure 1) with the correlation coefficient
= 0.0286 and R2 = 0.0818.
The MCC tree of the Afr-βBtCoV strains shows clearly the two major sub-genera
Norbercovirus, and Marbecovirus (Figure 2). We also observed that majority of the Sarbecovirus
(formerly lineage B) BtβCoV were isolated in Europe, precisely France and Spain and also
China (Figure 3). These consisted of SARSr viruses for instance EP11 strains which have been
reported to be widely distributed across Europe and parts of Asia [27]. The absence of
Sarbecovirus subgenera among the AfrBtCoV in our study seems to support the hypothesis that
highly pathogenic CoV’s such as SARS evolved outside the African continent. Although the lack
of Sarbecovirus in this study does not imply that this group of viruses is not currently circulating
among African bats, as the closest subgenra Hibecovirus which was also formerly classified
under Lineage B was identified in African Bats from Nigeria and Ghana [15], clustering with an
Australian isolate ascension no: EU834950. This simply reflects the information gap in
molecular data of BtCoV owing to poor surveillance in Africa. This also extends to information
human coronaviruses such as hCoVOC43, hCoV229E, in which sequence data is limited to just a
few countries such as Kenya and South Africa [28,29]. Phylogenetically the genus Rhinolophus
(Horse shoe bat) exhibited highest potential for intra-host diversity for BtCoV with the genus cocirculating both Sarbecovirus and Norbecovirus strains Figure 3. Our observation was similar to
that of a study from Thailand [30] and supports the theory of diverse intra/inter-host transmission
among different bat species which has been reported in previous studies [31,32]. Although we
did not find this type of intra host genetic diversification among the African bat species in this
study, it is believed that Rhinolophus bats are well distributed in Africa and are capable of
zoonotic transmission of pathogenic hCoV such as SARS, as evidenced by a study that identified
SARSrCoV antibodies among Rhinolophus bats in Africa [33].
The TMRCA for African Norbecovirus dating back to 1973, 95% HPD(1951-1990), and the
TMRCA for Marbecovirus strains 2007 95% HPD (2003-2012). This shows that Marbecovirus
is relatively recent and probably evolved from the existing Norbecovirus strains. Evolutionary
rate of the African BtβCoV was set at 1.301 × 10-3, HPD (1.064 × 10-3 – 1.434 × 10-3), this is
slightly higher that the evolutionary rate for the ongoing SARS CoV-2 which has been estimated
to have an evolutionary rate of 8.0 × 10-4 (www.nextstrain.org/ncov/global ). This is also
slightly higher than the evolutionary rate reported for the partial RdRP gene of HuCoV OC43 of
1.06 × 10-4 [34]. A similar topology was also observed for the MCC tree which included βCoV
from Asia and Europe, with a MRCA of 1915 (HPD 1880-1950) for all the strains, with the

African strains showing the consistent TMRCA as described above (Figure 3). The African
Norbecovirus strains seemed to emerge from their parental strain at around the year 1960 (HPD,
1930-1970) this observation supports the hypothesis that Norbecoviruses could have been
circulating in Africa long before they were first isolated. Whereas for the South African
Marbecovirus (lineage C) strains seemed to emerge from their parental lineage around the year
1987 (Figure 3), indicating a more recent introduction into Africa, however studies have dated
their origin based on partial RdrP gene to as back as 1859 [35].
PHYLOGEOGRAPHY OF Bat β-CoV IN AFRICA
Phylogeographic dispersal of the Bat β-CoV revealed numerous inter-continental spread events
from China and Hong Kong into Central Africa (DRC and Kenya), Cameroun in West Africa,
and South Africa, and also Mexico and Argentina in the Americas into West Africa Figure 4.
These long distance spread events may not necessarily represent actual transmission events, such
as inter/intra-host transmission by migrating bat species, as bats have not been known to migrate
across the Atlantic Ocean. However reports have shown the possibility of African bats to cover
long distances during migration [37]. These observations simply represent genetic similarity and
gene flow pathways of BtCoVs, which may due to other factors such as international trade in
exotic and wild animals serving as intermediate host of these viruses. There were also dispersal
of these viruses between France and some African countries such as Cameroun, South Africa and
the DRC. There was also dispersal from Spain into Kenya, South Africa and Madagascar. We
also observed dispersal across the Atlantic from Europe to Brazil, as well as across the Indian
Ocean from Australia into East and Southern Africa. One limitation to this study is that we were
unable to collect consistent data on the bat species from the reference isolates from other
continents. Hence the data presented serves as a hypothetical model reflecting genetic dispersal
of BtCoV and not species specific movements. The only dispersal event from Italy into Africa
was into Nigeria. Studies have shown the potential for African fruit bats to migrate long
distances covering thousands of Kilometers, for instance a study using satellite telemetry in
Zambia showed that Elodiun hevium is capable of covering thousands of kilometers during
migration [36]. Another study showed that African bats were capable of migration exceeding
2000km [37]. Intra-continental dispersal events were observed between Cameroun, DRC and
South Africa, as well as direct dispersal from Cameroon into Madagascar. The AfrBtCoV strains
displayed steady state population demography as depicted by their Bayesian Skyline plot (Figure
5). The population demography reported in this study might not represent the true picture of the
virus population, as the dataset utilized in this study is limited by its size and might not represent
the true demographic population of BtCoV in Africa.
CONCLUSIONS
We have presented data on the phylodiversity and evolutionary dynamics of Afr-βCoV and their
possible dispersal across the continent. Mutiple dispersal pathways were identified between
Europe and East/Southern Africa; there were also evidence of spread of BtCoV strains from Asia
into Africa. We also identified three CoV sub-genera Norbecovirus, Hibecovirus and
Marbecovirus circulating among African bat species with the probability of inter-species
transmission among bats. We also identified multiple corona virus sub-genera co-circulating in

China among the bat specie Rhinolophus sinicus, with the capability of zoonotic transmission
[32, 33]. Study limitations include the lack of sufficient sequence data in Genebank covering
AfrBtCoV, the relatively short genomic fragment analyzed and our inability to analyze spike
protein sequence data of these viruses, as a result of paucity of African BtCoV spike protein
sequences in established databases; this would have shed more light on their evolution in relation
to infectivity and transmission. We have shown the importance of molecular surveillance of
viruses with zoonotic potential such as coronaviruses. We advocate for broader trans-continental
studies involving full genome sequences of BtCoV to further understand the drivers for their
emergence and zoonotic spillovers into human population.
