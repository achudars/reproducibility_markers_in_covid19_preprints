ABSTRACT

37

Rapid and accurate diagnosis is crucial for successful outbreak containment. During the

38

current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency, the gold standard for

39

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection diagnosis is the

40

detection of viral RNA by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Additional diagnostic methods

41

enabling the detection of current or past SARS-CoV-2 infection would be highly beneficial to

42

ensure the timely diagnosis of all infected and recovered patients. Here, we investigated

43

several serological tools, i.e., two immunochromatographic lateral flow assays (LFA-1

44

(Biosynex COVID-19 BSS) and LFA-2 (COVID-19 Sign IgM/IgG)) and two enzyme-linked

45

immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) detecting IgA (ELISA-1 Euroimmun), IgM (ELISA-2 EDI)

46

and/or IgG (ELISA-1 and ELISA-2) based on well-characterized panels of serum samples

47

from patients and healthcare workers with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and from SARS-CoV-

48

2-negative patients. A total of 272 serum samples were used, including 62 serum samples

49

from hospitalized patients (panel 1 and panel 3), 143 serum samples from healthcare workers

50

(panel 2) diagnosed with COVID-19 and 67 serum samples from negative controls.

51

Diagnostic performances of each assay were assessed according to days after symptom onset

52

(dso) and the antigenic format used by manufacturers. We found overall sensitivities ranging

53

from 69% to 93% on panels 1 and 2 and specificities ranging from 83% to 98%. The clinical

54

sensitivity varied greatly according to the panel tested and the dso. The assays we tested

55

showed poor mutual agreement. A thorough selection of serological assays for the detection

56

of ongoing or past infections is advisable.

INTRODUCTION

59

A novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

60

causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a major healthcare threat (1).

61

At the beginning of the pandemic, the main healthcare objective was to stop the spread of the

62

virus. A key aspect to achieve this goal was to ensure early and accurate infection diagnosis

63

and appropriate quarantine for infected people. The gold standard for identifying SARS-CoV-

64

2 infection relies on the detection of viral RNA by reverse transcription (RT-) polymerase

65

chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques. However, the large-scale routine implementation of

66

this approach has been hampered by its time-consuming nature (most often 4−6 hours) and

67

shortages of materials. Moreover, the presence of sufficient amounts of the viral genome at

68

the site of sample collection is a prerequisite to allow genome detection. Missing the time

69

window of active viral replication or low-quality sampling can lead to false-negative results,

70

which would allow infected patients to spread the virus to their relatives and working

71

environment. In such conditions, additional diagnostic methods would be highly beneficial to

72

ensure timely diagnosis of all infected and recovered patients. Combining RT-PCR with the

73

screening of the onset and strength of the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 could

74

enhance diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy. There are now several studies describing the

75

kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection using laboratory ELISA tests, most

76

reporting that IgM is detectable as early as 5-14 days after the first clinical symptoms (2-7).

77

At this stage of the pandemic, many countries are now questioning how to prepare and

78

manage the easing of lockdown. Serological tools have an important place in establishing

79

such strategies. Validated serological assays are crucial for patient contact tracing and

80

epidemiological studies. Several formats of serological methods are beginning to be marketed,

81

i.e., lateral flow assays (LFAs) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) detecting

82

IgA, IgM and/or IgG. Data about the analytical and clinical performances of these devices are

83

still lacking, as well as their indication in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this

84

context, we evaluated the diagnostic performances of two LFAs and two commercial ELISA

85

kits detecting IgM, IgA and IgG based on well-characterized panels of serum samples from

86

PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers and from SARS-CoV-2-negative

87

patients. Diagnostic performances of each assay were assessed according to days after

88

symptom onset (dso) and the antigenic format used by manufacturers. This evaluation led us

89

to propose a decisional diagnostic algorithm based on serology, which may be applicable in

90

future seroprevalence studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

94

Patients and serum samples/Study design. The study design is summarized in Figure

95

1. A total of 272 serum samples were used, including 62 serum samples from hospitalized

96

patients (30 of the 62 in panel 1 and 50 of the 62 in panel 3); 143 serum samples from

97

healthcare workers (panel 2) diagnosed with COVID-19 at Strasbourg University Hospital

98

(Strasbourg, France), recruited in April 2020; and 67 serum samples from negative controls.

99

All sera of panels 1 and 2 were tested with two LFAs and two IgG ELISAs (Fig. 1). Fifty

100

serum samples (panel 3) from infected patients collected from 1 to 14 dso were tested by IgA

101

and IgM ELISA. Patient characteristics (the date and type of presenting symptoms) were

102

collected for each panel (Table 1). Laboratory detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed by

103

RT-PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swab specimens according to current guidelines (Institut

104

Pasteur, Paris, France; WHO technical guidance). This assay targets two regions of the viral

105

RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, with a threshold limit of detection of 10

106

copies per reaction. Serum samples were collected at a median of 9 dso (range, 1-28 dso) for

107

panel 1, 24 dso (range, 15-39 dso) for panel 2, and 7 dso (range, 0-14 dso) for panel 3. Serum

108

samples from 40 patients collected before the COVID-19 pandemic onset (from March to

109

November 2019) were selected as negative controls to determine clinical specificity. Another

110

27 serum samples were used to study cross-reactivity, including 20 samples from patients

111

infected with four other human coronaviruses two to three months before sampling (HCoV-

112

229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43), two from patients previously infected

113

with influenza A virus, one from a patient previously infected with human rhinovirus, two

114

containing rheumatoid factor, and two positive for antinuclear antibodies. All these negative

115

controls were tested with all evaluated assays. Additionally, nine lots of intravenous

116

immunoglobulins and one pool of six solvent detergent fresh-frozen plasma bags from healthy

117

donors obtained from the French blood bank were tested. Ethical approval was granted by the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.16.156166; this version posted June 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

118

local institutional review board (CE-2020-34). All patients provided written informed

119

consent.

120

Samples analyzed within 7 days were stored at 4°C. The other samples were stored at -20°C

121

with only a single freeze-thaw cycle.

122

Immunochromatographic lateral flow assays (LFAs). We evaluated two commercial

123

CE-marked LFAs: (i) LFA-1: Biosynex COVID-19 BSS (Biosynex, Switzerland, Fribourg)

124

and (ii) LFA-2: COVID-19 Sign IgM/IgG (Servibio/VEDALAB, France, Alençon). Technical

125

characteristics of the assays are summarized in the Supplementary data (Table S1). Both were

126

tested according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, for each test, 10 μL of serum

127

sample and two drops of buffer were added. The strip was placed flat at room temperature for

128

10 minutes, and then the results were scored according to the sample and control line intensity

129

only for the tests validated by the appearance of the control line. Interpretation was performed

130

by two independent readers using the standardized intensity scoring system that was

131

established previously. The absence of the sample line was scored as 0 (negative), whereas a

132

visible sample line was classified as positive, and the results were scored as follows: a weak

133

line as 1, a clear visible line with an intensity lower than that of the control line as 2, a clear

134

visible line with an intensity similar to that of the control line as 3, and a clear visible line

135

with an intensity higher than that of the control line as 4.

136

Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (IgA, IgM and IgG). The following ELISA

137

diagnostic kits were used for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies

138

according to the manufacturer’s instructions: (1) ELISA-1: ELISA anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and

139

IgG (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany) and (2) ELISA-2: EDITM novel coronavirus COVID-19

140

IgM and IgG (Epitope Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, USA). Technical characteristics of the

141

assays are summarized in the Supplementary data (Table S1). The assessed ELISA kits used

142

as their antigenic source full-length recombinant nucleocapsid protein and the recombinant S1

143

domain of the spike protein for IgA and IgG in ELISA-1 and for IgM and IgG in ELISA-2,

144

respectively. In brief, the optical density (OD) of the samples and calibrators was detected at

145

450 nm. Cutoffs for IgG detection were calculated according to the manufacturer’s

146

instructions. ELISA-1 results were expressed as a ratio, and a ratio greater than 1.1 was

147

considered positive. For ELISA-2, values greater than the cutoff were considered positive. To

148

allow correlation of the results, the results for IgG ELISA-2 were also expressed as a ratio

149

(OD sample/OD cutoff).

150

Statistical analysis. Clinical sensitivity was determined on samples from SARS-CoV-2

151

RT-PCR-positive patients and healthcare workers (inclusion criterion). Percentages of IgA,

152

IgM and IgG detection were calculated and compared among all evaluated serological devices

153

according to the dso category in panel 1 (i.e., 1 to 7, 8 to 14, and more than 14), in panel 2

154

(i.e., 15 to 21, 22 to 28, and more than 28), and in panel 3 (i.e., 0 to 3, 4 to 8, and 9 to 14). For

155

both LFAs, overall positivity was also evaluated based on positive results for the IgM or the

156

IgG test line. Clinical specificity was calculated using the serum samples from 40 patients

157

collected before the COVID-19 pandemic onset (from March to November 2019). Agreement

158

among kits was determined for IgM and IgG parameters using Fleiss’ kappa (overall

159

agreement) and Cohen’s kappa (agreement between pairs). A kappa value > 0.80 was deemed

160

satisfactory. The diagnostic performances were estimated by comparing the combined IgM

161

and IgG results according to SARS-CoV-2 infection status for each sample. Performance was

162

considered satisfactory if the diagnostic accuracy exceeded 90%. Analyses were conducted

163

using GraphPad (San Diego, CA, USA) Prism 6 software.

RESULTS

167

Study population. The general characteristics of the COVID-19 study participants are

168

presented in Table 1. We collected serum samples from a total of 198 patients, including 85

169

men. Ages ranged from 21 to 93 years, with a median of 43. Serum samples were divided into

170

several panels for evaluation, i.e., panels 1 and 3 correspond to COVID-19 patients, and panel

171

2 corresponds to COVID-19 healthcare workers. Among COVID-19 patients, the median age

172

was 68 (range: 34-93), and the median age was 32 (range: 21-62) among COVID-19

173

healthcare workers.

174

LFA and ELISA clinical performances. Clinical sensitivity and specificity

175

The clinical sensitivity evaluated on 171 serum samples from COVID-19 patients (panel 1

176

and panel 2, excluding the second serum sample in repeatedly sampled patients) varied

177

greatly between the two LFAs tested, especially for IgM, which was found in 83% and 30%

178

of samples, respectively. A higher percentage of IgM detection (90%) was observed between

179

15 and 21 dso for LFA-1 (Fig. S1). The sensitivity was similar for IgG between the devices,

180

with 68% of samples detected positive using LFA-1 and 65% detected positive using LFA-2.

181

The maximal detection rate for IgG was observed 28 dso, with 88% and 80% for LFA-1 and

182

LFA-2, respectively (Fig. S2). Combining IgM and IgG detection led to an overall sensitivity

183

of 93% using LFA-1 but only 69% using LFA-2.

184

The clinical sensitivity estimated for IgG detection with ELISA-1 and ELISA-2 on the

185

same 171 serum samples was 84% and 74%, respectively (Fig. 2). Both ELISA kits were

186

more sensitive than the LFA devices for IgG detection between 22 and 28 dso. For this

187

period, the sensitivity for IgG detection for ELISA-1 reached 96%.

188

Clinical sensitivity was also evaluated in each panel separately, given that specimens

189

were sampled earlier after symptom onset in panel 1 than in panel 2. In panel 1, IgM was

190

detected in 61% and 39% of sera using LFA-1 and LFA-2, respectively (Fig. S3). The

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.16.156166; this version posted June 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

191

optimum IgM detection rate was observed earlier with LFA-1 (80% of cases from 1 to 7 dso)

192

than with LFA-2 (50% of cases only 8 dso). In this panel, the percentage of IgG detection

193

ranged from 46% (LFA-1 and IgG ELISA-1) to 64% (IgG ELISA-2) (Fig. S4). The optimum

194

rate of IgG detection was observed for all assays 14 dso, with rates ranging from 75% (LFA-

195

2, IgG ELISA-1 and IgG ELISA-2) to 100% (LFA-1). However, only four infected patients

196

were sampled 14 dso in this panel. When combining IgM and IgG results using LFA devices

197

in panel 1, the sensitivity was 82% and 71% for LFA-1 and LFA-2, respectively (Fig. 3).

198

In panel 2, the sensitivity for IgM detection was 87% and 29% for LFA-1 and LFA-2,

199

respectively. LFA-1 was more efficient at detecting IgM from 15 to 21 dso in 92% of the

200

cases, whereas the highest percentage of IgM detection for LFA-2 was measured 28 dso, with

201

only 35% of the cases detected (Fig. S5). The percentage of IgG detection ranged from 64%

202

for ELISA-2 to 87% for ELISA-1 (Fig. S6). The optimum rate of IgG detection was observed

203

for all assays after 28 dso (i.e., 68% (ELISA-2), 80% (LFA-2), 88% (LFA-1) and 100%

204

(ELISA-1)). Combining IgM and IgG detection in this panel increased the overall sensitivity

205

to 95% for LFA-1 and to 70% for LFA-2 (Fig. 4).

206

IgM clinical specificity ranged from 88% (LFA-2) to 98% (LFA-1). IgG specificity was

207

98% for LFA-1, whereas it reached only 83% for LFA-2, corresponding to 7/40 false-positive

208

results with a weak intensity score of 1 to 2. ELISA-1 and ELISA-2 showed specificity values

209

for IgG of 98% and 90%, respectively. ELISA-1 showed a specificity of 88% for IgA, and

210

ELISA-2 showed a specificity of 98% for IgM (Table S2).

211

Relative performances of serological tools for SARS-CoV-2 (Panels 1 and 2). The

212

relative performance of evaluated assays was assessed on both panels 1 and 2 (not in panel 3).

213

The overall agreement among the four assays was 79% (Fleiss’ kappa: 0.57; 95% confidence

214

interval [CI]: 0.51−0.62). When comparing the two LFAs, the kappa agreement statistic was

215

0.50 (95% CI: 0.392-0.615) for IgG and 0.11 (95% CI: 0.014-0.199) for IgM. Between the

216

two IgG ELISAs, the kappa value reached 0.54 (95% CI: 0.433-0.654). High variability in

217

signal intensities was observed among the tested assays (Fig. 5A). Bland-Altman analysis of

218

the IgG ratio measured by ELISA-1 and ELISA-2 defined a 95% limit of agreement of 4.93

219

(S/CO), showing a good correlation between the two IgG ELISAs with ratios of at least 2

220

S/CO (Fig. 5B).

221

Time to IgM and IgA antibody onset. Fifty early serum samples (panel 3) of COVID-

222

19 patients were tested with ELISA IgA (Euroimmun) and ELISA-IgM (EDI) assays as well

223

as with both LFA devices. The IgM detection rate ranged from 34% (ELISA-IgM EDI) to

224

48% (LFA-1), whereas IgA was detected in 40% of samples. The optimum rate of detection

225

for IgM and IgA was observed between 9 and 14 dso (82% for LFA-1 IgM and 71% for IgA

226

ELISA) (Fig. 6). We further analyzed the delay of antibody onset in this panel according to

227

the hospitalization unit. When considering samples positive in at least two of the four assays,

228

we observed a trend towards an earlier detection of antibodies in patients admitted to the ICU

229

than in those with milder disease, but the specimen numbers per time interval were low (Fig.

230

7).

231

Cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and other Human Coronaviruses.

232

Analytical specificity reached 89% for IgM and 100% for IgG for both LFAs. LFA-1 cross-

233

reacted with the two serum samples containing rheumatoid factor (IgM band intensity scored

234

from 1 to 3). Both LFA assays cross-reacted with seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoV-

235

HKU1/NL63, 229E and OC43) with IgM band intensities scored from 1 to 2 (Table S3). The

236

analytical specificity was 96% for both IgG ELISA devices and reached 93% for IgA ELISA

237

(Euroimmun) and 100% for IgM ELISA (EDI). Both IgG ELISAs cross-reacted with a

238

different seasonal human coronavirus (HCoV-HKU1 for ELISA-2 (EDI) and HCoV-NL63 for

239

ELISA-1 (Euroimmun)).

241

DISCUSSION

242

In our study, we evaluated test performance for two LFAs (i.e., Biosynex (LFA-1) and

243

Servibio (LFA-2)) and two ELISA kits (i.e., ELISA-1 Euroimmun IgA and IgG and ELISA-2

244

EDI IgM and IgG). We found a good clinical specificity of 98% for LFA-1 (Biosynex IgM

245

and IgG), ELISA-1 (IgG) and ELISA-2 (IgM). Except for ELISA-1 IgA and for the IgM test

246

line on both LFA devices, other assays did not cross-react or they poorly cross-reacted.

247

Clinical sensitivity was first calculated on combined panels 1 and 2 according to days

248

after symptom onset. Considering the 171 serum samples, the majority of patients displayed

249

anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies only 15 days after symptom onset. The assays we tested showed

250

variable sensitivities and poor mutual agreement (Fig. 6A). However, only IgG ELISA-1

251

(Euroimmun) reached more than 90% clinical sensitivity 21 dso (Fig. 2). The observed

252

differences in terms of sensitivity may reflect the material used as an antigenic source for each

253

assay. Among the 4 coronavirus structural proteins, the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N)

254

proteins are the main immunogens (8). Specifically, antibodies directed against the viral spike

255

protein are expected to appear earlier than those directed against the nucleocapsid protein (3,

256

9). ELISA-1 (Euroimmun) and LFA-1 (Biosynex) use the recombinant spike protein S1

257

domain and the receptor binding domain (RBD) as antigenic sources, respectively, whereas

258

ELISA-2 (EDI) and ELISA-2 (Servibio) are based on a recombinant complete nucleocapsid

259

protein. Another major point explaining the variable results is the choice of the population

260

tested.

261

Since their development and availability, serological tools have been envisaged to meet

262

two different objectives.

263

The first objective was to obtain a faster diagnosis, improve the detection of acute infection

264

by detecting false-negative patients to decrease workloads to central laboratories and

265

accelerate clinical decision-making (6, 7). We evaluated clinical sensitivity in panel 1,

including serum samples from hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Only LFA-1 (Biosynex)

267

reached 100% detection after 14 dso when combining IgM and IgG detection. For the same

268

time point, the other assays (LFA-2, ELISA-1 IgG and ELISA-2 IgG) showed a suboptimal

269

sensitivity of 75%, which moderates the interest in their use in the triage of patients with

270

suspected COVID-19. Moreover, because of possible delays in seroconversion, we suggest

271

that rapid serology tests such as LFA cannot replace RT-PCR but should instead be

272

considered complementary tools to enhance access to the screening of symptomatic and

273

asymptomatic patients at the population level.

274

We also investigated IgM and IgA detection in a third panel (panel 3) of sera from

275

infected patients sampled early after symptom onset. If some patients developed anti-SARS-

276

CoV-2 antibodies from 1 to 3 dso, most had detectable IgM (65% with EDI IgM ELISA) and

277

IgA (71% with Euroimmun IgA ELISA) only between 9 and 14 days (Fig. 6). In addition,

278

symptom severity may affect the rate of seropositivity. A delayed or absent humoral response

279

against SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in some patients (10) and may result in negative

280

serology results (7; 11). Future studies are required to shed further light on the underlying

281

mechanisms. We observed a trend towards higher seroprevalence, with at least two of the

282

four assays being positive for patients admitted to the ICU compared to those with milder

283

disease.

284

The second diagnostic application of a SARS-CoV-2 serological diagnostic tool would

285

be to determine population seroprevalence. At this stage of the pandemic, many countries are

286

now preparing the exit from lockdown. Serological tools have an important place in

287

establishing such strategies. Therefore, we evaluated the four assays in panel 2, composed of

288

143 serum samples from COVID-19 healthcare workers with a diagnosis proven by RT-PCR.

289

Only LFA-1 (Biosynex) when combining IgM and IgG detection and ELISA-1 IgG

290

(Euroimmun) displayed an excellent clinical sensitivity after 21 days from the onset of

291

symptoms in the range of acceptable values defined by the French National Agency of

292

Medicine and Health Products Safety (ANSM) (90-100%) (Fig. 4).

293

At this stage of the pandemic, there are no data available about the COVID-19 global

294

seroprevalence in our country (or only partial data obtained in a small specific cohort). It

295

would be interesting in light of future prevalence studies to determine and discuss the positive

296

predictive value (PPV) of the LFA and ELISA kits we evaluated.

297

In this study, we first demonstrated that serological tools cannot replace RT-PCR for

298

acute infection diagnosis, and second, a thorough selection of serological assays for detecting

299

ongoing or past infections is advisable following the lifting of lockdowns. Special attention

300

should be paid to antigenic sources and validation against RT-PCR results. The reading of

301

sample test lines on LFA devices is still subjective regardless of the manufacturers, especially

302

for weak and/or equivocal bands, requiring a double reading of results. This subjectivity

303

makes it difficult to globalize their use with good reproducibility among healthcare workers.

304

Manufacturers should provide some intensity scale to facilitate the interpretation of these

305

assays. We recommend optimizing antibody detection by combining one LFA and one IgG

306

ELISA in cases of weak or equivocal signals on the LFA. Long-term studies are required to

307

investigate antibody persistence.
