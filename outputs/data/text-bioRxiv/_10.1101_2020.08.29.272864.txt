Abstract

22

We describe a mammalian cell-based assay capable of identifying coronavirus 3CL protease

23

(3CLpro) inhibitors without requiring the use of live virus. By enabling the facile testing of compounds

24

across a range of coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes, including the one from SARS-CoV-2, we are able to

25

quickly identify compounds with broad or narrow spectra of activity. We further demonstrate the

26

utility of our approach by performing a curated compound screen along with structure-activity

27

profiling of a series of small molecules to identify compounds with antiviral activity. Throughout these

28

studies, we observed concordance between data emerging from this assay and from live virus

29

assays. By democratizing the testing of 3CL inhibitors to enable screening in the majority of

30

laboratories rather than the few with extensive biosafety infrastructure, we hope to expedite the

31

search for coronavirus 3CL protease inhibitors, to address the current epidemic and future ones that

32

will inevitably arise.

Introduction

34

The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection of the past several months has

35

paralyzed countries around the world1,2. This crisis is further exacerbated by the dearth of approved

36

therapeutics, leaving physicians with few proven treatment options. In the past two decades, the

37

world has already suffered from two other major coronavirus outbreaks, Severe Acute Respiratory

38

Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), suggesting that coronaviruses

39

represent a real and ever-present threat to global health that must be addressed3. Yet, even if

40

therapeutics against the existing epidemic strains are identified, there are several hundred other

41

coronaviruses in active circulation within animal populations, many with the theoretical potential to

42

infect humans. To help identify therapeutics for the current epidemic along with preparing for the

43

next, there is a need for readily deployable small molecule screening assays that enable the

44

identification of therapeutics that are broad-acting across a large collection of coronavirus strains.

45
46

During coronavirus infection, the RNA genome is delivered into cells and translated into a pair of

47

polyproteins4. These polyproteins are then processed by a set of virally encoded proteases, of which

48

the three-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) performs the majority of cleavage events4. As a result

49

of its essential role in viral replication and high degree of conservation across all coronaviruses,

50

3CLpro enzymes represent important targets for therapeutic drug development5,6. Previous work

51

expressing a variety of viral proteases within yeast and mammalian cellular systems have shown

52

that protease expression can lead to profound cellular toxicity, which can be rescued by the addition

53

of protease inhibitors7–12. We hypothesized that if the expression of coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes

54

within mammalian cells leads to a similar toxic phenotype, this could form the basis of an easily

55

implemented mammalian cell-based assay to evaluate protease inhibitors. While multiple assays

56

exist to evaluate protease inhibitors, an assay of the nature we envisioned has clear advantages, as

57

it requires minimal upfront cost or effort, is accessible to many biomedical research labs, does not

58

involve the use of live virus, and requires no specialized reporter to read out protease activity. In

59

contrast, in vitro protease assays using purified protein have formed the backbone of inhibitor

60

screening, but require upfront efforts to isolate the pure protease and are not conducted under

61

physiologic cellular conditions13,14. In addition, if one desires to identify broad-acting coronavirus

62

inhibitors, one must purify and identify experimental conditions suitable for testing each protease in

63

vitro. An alternative approach for identifying protease inhibitors is the use of live virus which is

64

performed under more biologically relevant conditions, assuming relevant host cell systems can be

65

identified, but requires intensive safety training and specialized biosafety protocols15. For many

66

coronaviruses, no live virus assay exists, limiting the ability to test compounds within mammalian cell

67

systems to a small subset of all coronaviruses16. Furthermore, compounds with activity against live

68

virus may function through a number of mechanisms other than protease inhibition which cannot be

69

readily determined, and may lead to undesired off-target activities which are not realized until much

70

later in the drug development process17,18.

71
72

Here, we report a mammalian cell-based assay to identify coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitors that does

73

not require the use of live virus. We demonstrate the utility of the assay using the SARS-CoV-2

74

3CLpro, with EC50 values obtained from the assay showing good concordance with traditional live

75

virus testing for multiple compounds. We next establish the generality of the approach by testing a

76

diverse set of 3CLpro enzymes. Finally, we perform a small molecule screen, along with structure-

77

activity profiling of a set of compounds to find those with enhanced antiviral activity. The presented

78

data support the use of our assay system for the discovery of small molecule 3CLpro inhibitors and

79

the rapid characterization of their activity across multiple coronaviruses to identify those with broad

80

inhibitory activity.

86

Prior work has shown that the exogenous expression of viral proteases within cellular systems can

87

result in growth suppression or cell death. Motivated by this work, we sought to determine the effect

88

of expressing the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in HEK293T cells. Utilizing a cost-effective crystal-violet-

89

based approach to quantify cell abundance, we observed that expression of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro

90

results in significant growth inhibition as compared to the expression of a control protein, enhanced

91

yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) (Fig. 1a-b)19. This suppression of growth was dependent upon the

92

catalytic function of the enzyme, as mutating cysteine 145, which is essential for the enzyme’s

93

peptidase activity, abolished the growth defect (Fig. 1a-b). We sought to determine if the observed

94

growth defect could be rescued by incubating cells with GC376, a feline coronavirus inhibitor that

95

was recently reported to have activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro20. In comparison to untreated

96

control cells, the addition of GC376 led to a robust increase in cell growth (Fig. 1c-d).

97
98

Compound rescue of transfected 3CLpro cytotoxicity is similar to results obtained with live

99

virus

100

We next tested if this transfection-based assay could be used to determine compound EC50 values

101

and whether the values showed any correlation with those obtained with live virus. After incubating

102

SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro transfected cells with a range of GC376 concentrations, we calculated an EC50

103

of 3.30 µM, which is similar to published values reported using live virus on Vero E6 (EC50 2.2 µM,

104

0.9 µM, 0.18 µM, 4.48 µM) and Vero 76 cells (EC50 3.37 µM) (Fig. 2a and Table 1)20–24. We

105

investigated the assay’s tolerance to deviation by varying the amount of plasmid transfected or the

106

number of cells seeded into wells containing compound (Supplementary Fig. 1). In all cases, the

107

assay was robust to variation, delivering a similar EC50 for GC376 across all conditions. We also

108

tested an orthogonal method of quantifying cell abundance based on fluorescence microscopy and

109

observed agreement with the results obtained with crystal violet staining (Supplementary Fig. 2).

110

This suggests that the assay system is robust to variation and provides consistent results.

112

We next conducted dose-response profiling for two additional SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors,

113

compound 4 and compound 11a, and observed reversal of the toxic effect of the protease in a dose-

114

dependent manner (Fig. 2b-c)25,26. In agreement with the results obtained with GC376, the EC50

115

value for compound 4 was comparable to those obtained with live virus, 0.98 µM and 3.023 µM,

116

respectively (Table 1)24. Unexpectedly, we calculated an EC50 of 6.89 µM for 11a, which is

117

approximately 10-fold higher than the literature reported value of 0.53 µM, based on viral plaque

118

assay26. We have noticed that literature reported EC50 values from live virus testing could range over

119

an order of magnitude depending on the exact method employed, as is the case for GC376 (Table

120

1). To resolve this discrepancy between the transfection-based approach and the live virus assay,

121

we conducted live virus testing of 11a using the commonly employed readout of cytopathic effect in

122

Vero E6 cells and observed closer concordance with our transfection-based results (Supplementary

123

Figure 3 and Table 1)20,24,27. To measure the toxicity of each compound, we exposed EYFP-

124

transfected cells to each molecule and determined CC50 values (Fig. 2). We also calculated the

125

selectivity index (SI) for each compound tested in this study (Supplementary Table 1).

126
127

We hypothesized that the assay would be able to distinguish between compounds that are only

128

active on the purified SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and those that are able to inhibit the live virus through

129

protease inhibition. In general, we observe concordance between compounds showing activity within

130

this transfection-based 3CL assay and live virus studies (Supplementary Fig. 4a-e)13. However,

131

within the assay, we did not observe activity for ebselen, a small molecule with demonstrated activity

132

against the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in vitro and activity against the SARS-CoV-2 live virus

133

(Supplementary Fig. 4f). We suggest that this may be due to ebselen targeting more than 3CLpro

134

within the live virus assay, which is in line with work showing that ebselen is highly reactive and

135

readily forms selenosulfide bonds with numerous proteins including the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like

136

protease (PLP)18,28,29.

139

We hypothesized that this assay may be used to study other coronavirus 3CLpros to enable users to

140

identify broad-acting inhibitors, as constructs containing other 3CLpro enzymes could be readily

141

synthesized. To test the assay’s generality, we created expression constructs for 3CL proteases

142

from five other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Bat-CoV-HKU9, HCoV-NL63 and IBV) with

143

variable amino acid identity compared with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (Supplementary Fig. 5a). For each

144

of these proteases, we confirmed that expression in mammalian cells resulted in toxicity that is

145

dependent upon the enzyme’s catalytic activity (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Next, we tested GC376,

146

compound 4, and 11a across this panel of proteases. GC376, a drug originally identified for use

147

against the Feline Infectious Peritonitis virus, showed EC50 <10 µM for the most, but not all of

148

proteases tested30. Unexpectedly, compound 4, which was originally designed as a SARS-CoV

149

3CLpro inhibitor showed particular potency against IBV 3CLpro (EC50 = 0.058 µM) along with broad

150

activity (EC50 <10 µM) for all other 3CL proteases tested. In contrast to GC376 and compound 4, 11a

151

had a relatively narrow activity spectrum with EC50 <10 µM against only SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-

152

2 3CLpro enzymes (Fig. 3). Of note, in all cases where previous live virus data was available, the

153

EC50 values obtained from this transfection-based assay were similar (Table 1).

154
155

Rapid testing to identify SARS-CoV-2-3CL protease inhibitors

156

Having further determined the assay’s ability to examine the effects of active individual compounds,

157

we sought to determine its suitability for small molecule screening. Before performing the screen, we

158

optimized the testing parameters to ensure suitable performance characteristics (Supplementary Fig.

159

6 and Methods)31. We compiled a collection of 162 diverse protease inhibitors, along with

160

compounds with reported in vitro activity against 3CLpro enzymes or structural similarity to known

161

3CLpro inhibitors (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3). Of the nearly 200

162

compounds tested, two potent hits were identified, GC373 and GRL-0496 (Fig. 4a, Supplementary

163

Table 2)32.

165

We noted that GC373 is structurally similar to its prodrug GC376, except for the change of the

166

bisulfide salt adduct to an aldehyde warhead22,33. Additional testing of GC373 revealed it to have a

167

similar EC50 as GC376 in both the transfection assay and when tested against live SARS-CoV-2

168

virus, suggesting that the differences in structure has a minimal effect on their potency

169

(Supplementary Fig. 7 and Table 1), although solubility may be affected33. The other hit from the

170

screen, GRL-0496, shares structural similarity to several other compounds within the library, one of

171

which is a previously reported 3CLpro inhibitor (MAC-5576) that failed to show activity against

172

SARS-CoV-2 in a live virus assay24,34. Additional testing of GRL-0496 revealed it to have an EC50 of

173

5.05 µM against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro within our transfection-based assay (Fig. 4c). To verify GRL-

174

0496’s activity, we tested it against live SARS-CoV-2 virus, and confirmed its potency (EC50 = 9.12

175

µM) (Fig. 4d). We next tested GRL-0496 against the full panel of 3CLpro enzymes we had previously

176

examined and observed a narrow range of activity, with EC50 <10 µM only observed against SARS-

177

CoV 3CLpro and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, in agreement with previous live virus testing (Supplementary

178

Fig. 8 and Table 1)27. We also tested GC373 against the full panel of 3CLpro enzymes and observed

179

concordance with GC376, with SARS-CoV 3CLpro, MERS-CoV 3CL pro, and IBV 3CL pro

180

demonstrating an EC50 <10 µM (Supplementary Fig. 8).

Discussion

183

Given the potential for protease inhibitors in the treatment of viral illnesses, small molecule inhibitors

184

of coronavirus 3CL proteases represent a promising avenue for treating infections caused by this

185

large family of viruses. Here, we present a simplified assay to identify candidate inhibitors under

186

physiologic cellular conditions. This approach presents significant advantages over other methods to

187

detect 3CL protease inhibitory activity with its ease of use and ability to be performed with equipment

188

and reagents commonly available to many biomedical research laboratories. While conventional

189

methods for identifying 3CL protease inhibitors make use of in vitro purified protease, the isolation of

190

sufficiently pure enzyme in its native state can be costly and labor intensive. Furthermore, assays

191

using purified protease fail to consider cell permeability and the influence of the extracellular and

192

intracellular milieu on compound activity. In comparison to live virus-based assays, the outlined

193

approach does not require extensive biosafety containment. These data also suggest that the

194

approach described here is applicable to a number of coronaviruses for which live virus assays may

195

not be available or would be deemed ethically challenging to be performed even with extensive

196

biosafety infrastructure35,36. Finally, because the phenotype assayed within this approach is driven

197

solely by protease activity, it may enable the distinction between compounds with multiple biological

198

targets and subsequent potential for off-target toxicity from those that function primarily as 3CLpro

199

inhibitors.

200
201

A number of surrogate assays that aim to identify molecules with activity against proteins encoded

202

by SARS-CoV-2 have recently been reported37–39. These assays were developed to provide

203

physiologically meaningful molecule testing without needing to use live SARS-CoV-2 cultures in

204

order to allow for rapid testing and widespread adoption to labs without necessary safety

205

infrastructure. The aforementioned assays have focused primarily on identifying neutralizing

206

antibodies targeted at the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. To our knowledge, a reporter-free

207

surrogate assay to identify coronavirus 3CL protease inhibitors validated with multiple known

208

coronavirus 3CL protease inhibitors has not been reported.

209
210

Within the literature, EC50 values obtained for a 3CLpro inhibitor against live virus can show a broad

211

range of potency, with some compounds demonstrating EC50 values across multiple orders of

212

magnitude (Table 1). These differences appear to be driven by variation in experimental setup such

213

as cell line used, assay readout, incubation period, and initial concentration of virus added. While we

214

have observed agreement between the EC50 values obtained from the described transfection-based

215

method and those reported in the literature, given the differences in EC50 across assays, we suggest

216

caution when comparing results across studies. By developing this transfection-based 3CLpro

217

testing platform, we hope to facilitate the discovery of new coronavirus inhibitors while also

218

facilitating the comparison of existing inhibitors within a single simplified assay system. Furthermore,

we propose that this cellular protease assay system could be industrialized to screen and optimize a

220

large number of compounds to discover potential treatments for future viral pandemics.

Methods

223

Cell Lines and Cell Culture

224

HEK293T and HEK293 cells used in this study were obtained from ATCC. Cells were maintained at

225

37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. HEK293T and HEK293 cells were grown in

226

Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) which was supplemented with 10% fetal

227

bovine serum (Gibco) and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). HEK293T and HEK293 cells were

228

confirmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination with the Agilent MycoSensor PCR Assay Kit.

229

To obtain HEK293 cells stably expressing EYFP, cells were co-transfected with EYFP plasmids

230

harboring the piggyBac transposon (pPB bsr2-EYFP) (Yusa et al., 2009) and pCMV-mPBase

231

(mammalian codon-optimized PBase) encoding a piggyBac transposase using Lipofectamine 2000

232

(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. One day after transfection, the transfected

233

cells were selected with 10 µg/mL of blasticidin (Invitrogen).

234
235

Transfections and Drug Selections

236

24 h prior to transfection, 293T cells were seeded at 65-75% confluency into 24-well plates coated

237

for 30 min with a 1 mg/mL solution of poly-D-lysine (MP Biomedicals Inc.) and washed with PBS

238

(Gibco) once prior to media addition. The next day, 500 ng of 3CLpro expression plasmid, unless

239

otherwise stated, was incubated with Opti-MEM and Lipofectamine 2000 for 30 min at room

240

temperature prior to dribbling on cells, as per manufacturer’s protocol. For plating into drug

241

conditions, 20 h after transfection, cells were washed once with PBS and 200 µL Trypsin-EDTA

242

0.25% (Gibco) was added to cells to release them from the plate. Trypsinized cell slurry was pipetted

243

up and down repeatedly to ensure a single cell suspension. 96-well plates were coated with poly-D-

244

lysine, either coated manually with 1 µg/mL poly-D-lysine in PBS solution for 30 min or purchased

245

pre-coated with poly-D-lysine (Corning). Wells were filled with 100 µL of media ± drug and 1 µg/mL

puromycin and were seeded with 9 µL of trypsinized cell slurry. For higher throughput experiments,

247

multiple individually transfected wells of a 24-well plate were combined after trypsinization and prior

248

to seeding in drug. After seeding into wells containing drug and puromycin, cells were incubated for

249

48 h unless otherwise specified.

251

Plasmids

252

All vectors used in this study were cloned into the pLEX307 backbone (Addgene #41392) using

253

Gateway LR II Clonase Enzyme mix (Invitrogen). 3CL proteases used in this study were generated

254

using gene fragments ordered from Twist Biosciences. Inactive 3CL proteases were generated by

255

site directed mutagenesis of the essential catalytic cysteine. DNA was transformed into NEB 10-beta

256

high efficiency competent cells. Sanger sequencing to verify proper inserts were done for all

257

plasmids used in this study (Genewiz).

258
259

Plasmid DNA was isolated using standard miniprep buffers (Omega Biotek) and silica membrane

260

columns (Biobasic). To reduce batch-to-batch variability between plasmid DNA isolations and its

261

subsequent impact on transfection efficiency, multiple plasmid DNA extractions were conducted in

262

parallel, diluted to 50 ng/µL and pooled together.

263
264

Crystal Violet Staining and Quantification

265

The crystal violet staining protocol was adapted from Feoktistova et. al.19 Briefly, after compound

266

incubation with 3CLpro expressing cells in 96-well plates, the medium was discarded and cells were

267

washed once with PBS. Cells were incubated with 50 µL of crystal violet staining solution (0.5%

268

crystal violet in 80% water and 20% methanol) and rocked gently for 30 min. The staining solution

269

cells were left to dry for ≥4 h on the laboratory bench or within the chemical hood. The crystal violet

stain from each well was transferred to a new 96-well plate for reading in a Tecan Infinite F50 plate

274

reader. Absorbance was measured at 595 nm twice and values were averaged between replicate

275

measurements. Blank wells were included in each batch of experiments, and absorbance values

276

were normalized by background levels of staining from blank wells.

Statistical Analysis of Dose Response Curves

279

For analysis of crystal violet staining experiments, relative growth was calculated from background

280

normalized absorbance values. Test wells containing drug were divided by average background

281

normalized values from wells where cells were expressing protease and exposed to vehicle, when

282

available. Otherwise, values were normalized by values from protease-expressing cells exposed to

283

the lowest concentration of drug included in the dose-response curve. When there were significant

284

deviations from protease-expressing cells exposed to no drug and protease-expressing cells

285

exposed to lowest concentrations of drug included in the dose-response curve, experiments were

286

repeated with normalization by protease-expressing cells exposed to no drug. CC50 values were

287

calculated in Prism using the nonlinear regression functionality and derived from dose-response

288

curves with EYFP transfected cells. A nonlinear curve fitting function accounting for variable curve

289

slopes was calculated by plotting the normalized response as a function of log(compound). Similarly,

290

EC50 values were calculated in GraphPad Prism also using the nonlinear regression functionality. A

291

nonlinear curve fitting function measuring the stimulatory response of a compound as a function of

292

an unnormalized response was used to calculate the EC50. All reported values were confirmed to not

293

have ambiguous curve fitting. The 95% confidence interval of EC50 calculations was also calculated

294

and included.

295
296

For analysis of live virus experiments, EC50 values were determined by fitting a nonlinear curve to

297

the data with the assumption of a normalized response (GraphPad Prism). Cells were confirmed as

298

mycoplasma negative prior to use.

Compound Screening

301

For screening condition optimization, we measured the Z-Factor for replicates of positive controls

302

GC376, tested at 50 µM, and compound 4, tested at 20 µM. Replicate measurements were recorded

303

for DMSO negative controls and positive control compounds after 48, 72, and 96 h of incubation with

304

drug. Background normalized crystal violet absorbance values at each timepoint were collected.

305
306

During the drug screen, within each of the four plates screened, two positive controls wells were

307

included to ensure assay reliability, along with several wells with the negative control 0.1% DMSO

308

condition. All compounds were screened at 10 µM resuspended in DMSO (Fisher Scientific).

309

For hit selection, we employed a robust z-score method. We first normalized data using a robust z-

310

score that uses median and median absolute deviation (MAD) instead of mean and standard

311

deviation. We then used a threshold of 3.5 MAD to determine which drugs rescued the cytotoxicity

312

imposed by expression of the viral protease40.

313
314

Live Virus Assay

315

The SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019-nCoV/USA_WA1/2020 was grown and titered in Vero-E6 cells. One

316

day before the experiment, Vero-E6 cells were seeded at 30,000 cells/well in 96 well-plates. Serial

317

dilutions of the test compound were prepared in media (EMEM + 10% FCS +

318

penicillin/streptomycin), pipetted onto cells, and virus was subsequently added to each well at an

319

MOI of 0.2. Cells were incubated at in a humidified environment at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 72 h after

320

addition of virus. Cytopathic effect was scored by independent, blinded researchers. The reported

321

cytopathic effect value represents the average from two independent reviewers. Percent Inhibition

322

was calculated by comparison to control wells with no inhibitor added. All live virus experiments were

323

conducted in a biosafety level 3 lab.

Cells plated on a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-OneTM) and washed once immediately before imaging.

327

EYFP fluorescence imaging was performed using an Axio Observer 7 microscope (Zeiss) equipped

328

with a Plan-Apochromat 10X objective (0.45 N.A.) with 1-by-1 pixel binning. Optical Illumination bias

329

was empirically derived by sampling background areas and subsequently used to flatten images.
