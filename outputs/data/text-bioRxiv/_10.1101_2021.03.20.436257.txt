The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility, pathogenesis and

22

resistance to vaccines presents urgent challenges for curbing the COVID-19 pandemic.

23

While Spike mutations that enhance virus infectivity may drive the emergence of these novel

24

variants, studies documenting a critical a role for interferon responses in the early control of

25

SARS-CoV-2 infection, combined with the presence of viral genes that limit these responses,

26

suggest that interferons may also influence SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Here, we compared the

27

potency of 17 different human interferons against 5 viral lineages sampled during the course

28

of the global outbreak that included ancestral and emerging variants. Our data revealed

29

increased interferon resistance in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, indicating that evasion of

30

innate immunity is a significant driving force for SARS-CoV-2 evolution. These findings

31

have implications for the increased lethality of emerging variants and highlight the

32

interferon subtypes that may be most successful in the treatment of early infections.

33
34

The human genome encodes a diverse array of antiviral interferons (IFNs). These include the type

35

I IFNs (IFN-Is) such as the 12 IFNα subtypes, IFNβ and IFNω that signal through ubiquitous

36

IFNΑR receptor, and the type III IFNs (IFN-IIIs) such as IFNλ1, IFNλ2 and IFNλ3 that signal

37

through the more restricted IFNλR receptor that is present in lung epithelial cells1. IFN diversity

38

may be driven by an evolutionary arms-race to enable the host to counteract diverse viral

39

pathogens2. For instance, the IFNα subtypes exhibit >78% amino acid sequence identity, but

40

IFNα14, IFNα8 and IFNα6 most potently inhibited HIV-1 in vitro and in vivo3-5, whereas IFNα5

41

most potently inhibited influenza H3N2 in lung explant cultures6. Surprisingly, while SARS-CoV-

42

2 was sensitive to IFNα2, IFNβ, and IFNλ7-9, and clinical trials on IFNα2 and IFNβ demonstrated

Results

47

The current study was undertaken to determine which IFNs would best inhibit SARS-CoV-2. We

48

selected 5 isolates from prominent lineages13 during the course of the pandemic (Fig. 1,

49

Supplementary Table 1). USA-WA1/2020 is the standard strain utilized in many in vitro and in

50

vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2 and belongs to lineage A13. It was isolated from the first COVID-19

51

patient in the US, who had a direct epidemiologic link to Wuhan, China, where the virus was first

52

detected14. By contrast, subsequent infection waves from Asia to Europe15 were associated with

53

the emergence of the D614G mutation16. D614G+ strains in lineage B spread with devastating

54

speed, likely due to its increased transmissibility17,18. It accumulated additional mutations in Italy

55

as lineage B.1 which then precipitated a severe outbreak in New York City19. More recently,

56

lineage B.1.1.7 acquired the N501Y mutation that is associated with enhanced transmissibility in

57

the United Kingdom13. Lineage B.1.351 was first reported in South Africa and acquired an

58

additional E484K mutation that is associated with resistance to neutralizing antibodies20,21. Both

59

B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 have now been reported in multiple countries and there is increasing concern

60

that these may become dominant22. Representative SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the B, B.1, B.1.1.7

61

and B.1.351 lineages were obtained from BEI Resources (Supplementary Table 1) and amplified

62

once in an alveolar type II epithelial cell line, A549, that we stably transduced with the receptor

63

ACE2 (A549-ACE2) (Supplementary Fig. 1a).

65

A549-ACE2 cells were pre-incubated with 17 recombinant IFNs (PBL Assay Science) overnight

66

in parallel and in triplicate, then infected with a non-saturating virus dose for 2 h (Supplementary

67

Fig. 1b). We normalized the IFNs based on molar concentrations similar to our previous work with

68

HIV-13,23. For rapid and robust evaluation of antiviral activities against live SARS-CoV-2 isolates,

69

we utilized a quantitative PCR approach (Fig. 2a). An initial dose-titration study showed that a 2

70

pM concentration maximally distinguished the antiviral activities of IFNβ and IFNλ1

71

(Supplementary Fig. 1c), and was therefore used to screen the antiviral IFNs. In the absence of

72

IFN, all 5 isolates reached titers of ~104-106 copies per 5 µl input of RNA extract (Fig. 2). Using

73

absolute copy numbers (Fig. 2) and values normalized to mock as 100% (Supplementary Fig. 2),

74

the 17 IFNs showed a range of antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2. The 3 IFNλ subtypes

75

exhibited none to very weak (<2-fold) antiviral activities compared to most IFN-Is (Fig. 2 and

76

Supplementary Fig. 2, blue bars). This was despite the fact that the assay showed a robust dynamic

77

range, with some IFNs inhibiting USA-WA1/2020 >2500-fold to below detectable levels (Fig. 2a).

78

IFN potencies against the 5 isolates correlated with each other (Supplementary Fig. 3), and a

79

similar rank-order of IFN antiviral potency was observed for D614G+ isolates (Fig. 2b,

80

Supplementary Fig. 2). Overall, IFNα8, IFNβ and IFNω were the most potent, followed by IFNα5,

81

IFNα17 and IFNα14 (Fig. 2c).

82
83

We reported that HIV-1 inhibition by the IFNα subtypes correlated with IFNΑR signaling capacity

84

and binding affinity to the IFNΑR2 subunit3,23. IFNΑR signaling capacity, as measured in an IFN-

85

sensitive reporter cell line (iLite cells; Euro Diagnostics), correlated with the antiviral potencies of

86

the IFNα subtypes against SARS-CoV-2 lineages A and B, but not B.1, B.1.351 or B.1.1.7 strains

87

(Fig. 3a). Interestingly, IFNα subtype inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 did not correlate with IFNΑR2

binding affinity (Fig. 3b)24, as measured by surface plasmon resonance by the Schreiber group24.

89

Furthermore, correlations between SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 inhibition3 were weak at best (Fig.

90

3c). These findings suggested that IFN-mediated control of SARS-CoV-2 isolates may be

91

qualitatively distinct from that of HIV-1.

92
93

We generated a heat-map to visualize the antiviral potency of diverse IFNs against the 5 isolates

94

and observed marked differences in IFN sensitivities (Fig. 4a). Pairwise analysis of antiviral

95

potencies between isolates collected early (January 2020) and later (March-December 2020)

96

during the pandemic were performed against the 14 IFN-Is (IFN-IIIs were not included due to low

97

inhibition, Fig. 2). The overall IFN-I sensitivity of USA-WA1/2020 and Germany/BavPat1/2020

98

isolates were not significantly different from each other (Fig. 4b). By contrast, relative to

99

Germany/BavPat1/2020, we observed 17 to 122-fold IFN-I resistance of the emerging SARS-

100

CoV-2 variants (Fig. 4c), with the B.1.1.7 strain exhibiting the highest IFN-I resistance. The level

101

of interferon resistance was more striking when compared to USA-WA1/2020, where emerging

102

SARS-CoV-2 variants exhibited 25 to 322-fold higher IFN-I resistance (Supplementary Fig. 4a).

103
104

The experiments above allowed the simultaneous analysis of 17 IFNs against multiple SARS-

105

CoV-2 isolates, but do not provide information on how different IFN-I doses affect virus

106

replication. It also remains unclear if the emerging variants were resistant to IFN-IIIs. We therefore

107

titrated a potent (IFNβ; 0.002 to 200 pM) and a weak (IFNλ1; 0.02 to 2000 pM) interferon against

108

the lineage B, B.1, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 isolates (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 4b). We included

109

an additional B.1.1.7 strain, hCov-19/England/204820464/2020 (Supplementary Table 1). The

110

50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of the B.1.1.7 variants were 4.3 to 8.3-fold higher for IFNβ

and 3.0 to 3.5 higher for IFNλ1 than the lineage B isolate (Fig. 4d), whereas the B.1 isolate

112

exhibited 2.6 and 5.5-fold higher IC50 for IFNλ1 and IFNβ, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 4b).

113

Interestingly, maximum inhibition was not achieved with either IFNβ or IFNλ1 against the B.1.1.7

114

variant, plateauing at 15 to 20-fold higher levels than the ancestral lineage B isolate (Fig. 4d). In

115

a separate experiment, the B.1.351 variant was also more resistant to IFNβ (>500-fold) and IFNλ1

116

(26-fold) compared to the lineage B isolate (Fig. 4d). These data confirm that the B.1, B.1.1.7 and

117

B.1.351 isolates have evolved to resist the IFN-I and IFN-III response.

119

Discussion

120

Numerous studies done by many laboratories highlighted the importance of IFNs in SARS-CoV-

121

2 control. Here, we demonstrate the continued evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to escape IFN responses

122

and identify the IFNs with the highest antiviral potencies. IFNλ initially showed promise as an

123

antiviral that can reduce inflammation25, but was recently associated with virus-induced lung

124

pathology26. Our data suggests that higher doses of IFNλ may be needed to achieve a similar

125

antiviral effect in vivo as the IFN-Is. Nebulized IFNβ showed potential as a therapeutic against

126

COVID-1911, and our data confirm IFNβ as a highly potent antiviral against SARS-CoV-2.

127

However, IFNβ was also linked to pathogenic outcomes in chronic mucosal HIV-123, murine

128

LCMV27 and if administered late in mice, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV28,29 infection. By

129

contrast, IFNα8 altered 3-fold less genes in primary mucosal lymphocytes than IFNβ23, but showed

130

similar anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency as IFNβ. IFNα8 also exhibited high antiviral activity against

131

HIV-13, raising its potential for treatment against both pandemic viruses. Notably, IFNα8 appeared

132

to be an outlier, as the antiviral potencies of the IFNα subtypes against SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1

133

did not strongly correlate. IFNα6 potently restricted HIV-13,4 but was one of the weakest IFNα

134

subtypes against SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, IFNα5 strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2, but weakly

135

inhibited HIV-13. Our data strengthens the theory that diverse IFNs may have evolved to restrict

136

distinct virus families2,23. The mechanisms underlying these qualitative differences remain unclear.

137

While IFNΑR signaling contributes to antiviral potency3,4,24, diverse IFNs may have distinct

138

abilities to mobilize antiviral effectors in specific cell types. Comparing the interferomes induced

139

by distinct IFNs in lung epithelial cells may help unravel antiviral mechanisms that is responsible

140

for the differential effects.

141
142

Our data unmasked a concerning trend for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants to resist the antiviral

143

IFN response. Prior to this work, the emergence and fixation of variants was linked to enhanced

144

viral infectivity due to mutations in the Spike protein13,16-18. However, previous studies on HIV-1

145

infection suggested that IFNs can also shape the evolution of pandemic viruses30,31. In fact, SARS-

146

CoV-2 infected individuals with either genetic defects in IFN signaling32 or IFN-reactive

147

autoantibodies33 had increased risk of developing severe COVID-19. As IFNs are critical in

148

controlling early virus infection levels, IFN-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants may produce higher

149

viral loads that could in turn promote transmission and/or exacerbate pathogenesis. Consistent with

150

this hypothesis, alarming preliminary reports linked B.1.1.7 with increased viral loads34 and risk

151

of death35-37. In addition to Spike, emerging variants exhibited mutations in nucleocapsid,

152

membrane and nonstructural proteins NSP3, NSP6 and NSP12 (Supplementary Table 1). These

153

viral proteins were shown to antagonize IFN signaling in cells38-40. It will be important to identify

154

the virus mutations driving IFN-I resistance in emerging variants, the underlying molecular

155

mechanisms, and its consequences for COVID-19 pathogenesis.

Overall, the current study suggested a role for the innate immune response in driving the evolution

158

of SARS-CoV-2 that could have practical implications for interferon-based therapies. Our findings

159

reinforce the importance of continued full-genome surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, and assessments

160

of emerging variants not only for resistance to vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies, but also for

161

evasion of the host interferon response.

Virus isolates. All experiments with live SARS-CoV-2 were performed in a Biosafety Level-3

181

(BSL3) facility with powered air-purifying respirators at the University of Colorado Anschutz

182

Medical Campus. SARS-CoV-2 stocks from BEI Resources (Supplementary Table 1) had

183

comparable titers >106 TCID50/ml (Supplementary Fig. 1a) except for the B.1.1.7 strains

184

(CA_CDC_5574/2020 and England/204820464/2020). The contents of the entire vial (~0.5 ml)

185

were inoculated into 3 T-75 flasks containing 3´106 A549-ACE2 cells, except for B.1.1.7 which

186

was inoculated into 1 T-75 flask. After culturing for 72 h, the supernatants were collected and spun

187

at 2700´g for 5 min to remove cell debris, and frozen at -80°C. The A549-amplified stocks were

188

titered according to the proposed assay format (Supplementary Fig. 1b, Fig. 2a). Briefly, 2.5´104

189

A549-ACE2 cells were plated per well in a 48-well plate overnight. The next day, the cells were

190

infected with 300, 30, 3, 0.3, 0.03 and 0.003 µl (serial 10-fold dilution) of amplified virus stock in

191

300 µl final volume of media for 2 h. The virus was washed twice with PBS, and 500 µl of

192

complete media with the corresponding IFN concentrations were added. After 24 h, supernatants

193

were collected, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 3200´g for 5 min.

SARS-CoV-2 quantitative PCR. For rapid and robust assessments of viral replication, we utilized

196

a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) approach. This assay would require less handling of

197

infectious, potentially high-titer SARS-CoV-2 in the BSL3 compared to a VeroE6 plaque assay,

198

as the supernatants can be directly placed in lysis buffer containing guanidinium thiocyanate that

199

would inactivate the virus by at least 4-5 log1043. To measure SARS-CoV-2 levels, total RNA was

200

extracted from 100 µl of culture supernatant using the E.Z.N.A Total RNA Kit I (Omega Bio-Tek)

201

and eluted in 50 µl of RNAse-free water. 5 µl of this extract was used for qPCR. Official CDC

were investigated. The real-time qPCR reaction was run on a Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time

thermocycler under the following conditions: 55°C 10 mins for reverse transcription, then 95°C 1

210

min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C 10s and 60°C 30s. The absolute quantification of the N1 copy

number was interpolated using a standard curve with 107-101 serial 10-fold dilution of a control

212

plasmid (nCoV-CDC-Control Plasmid, Eurofins).

214

Antiviral inhibition assay. We used a non-saturating dose of the amplified virus stock for the IFN

215

inhibition assays. These titers were expected to yield ~105 copies per 5 µl input RNA extract

216

(Supplementary Fig. 1b). Recombinant IFNs were obtained from PBL Assay Science. In addition

217

to the IFN-Is (12 IFNα subtypes, IFNβ and IFNω), we also evaluated 3 IFNλ subtypes (IFNλ1,

218

IFNλ2, IFNλ3). To normalize the IFNs, we used molar concentrations23 instead of international

219

units (IU), as IU values were derived from inhibition of encelphalomyocarditis virus, which may

220

not be relevant to SARS-CoV-2. To find a suitable dose to screen 17 IFNs in parallel, we

221

performed a dose-titration experiment of the USA-WA1/2020 strain with IFNβ and IFNλ1. A dose

222

of 2 pM allowed for maximum discrimination of the antiviral potency IFNβ versus IFNλ1

223

(Supplementary Fig. 1c). Serial 10-fold dilutions of IFNβ and IFNλ1 were also used in follow-up

224

experiments. Thus, in 48-well plates, we pre-incubated 2.5´104 A549-ACE2 cells with the IFNs

for 18 h, then infected with the A549-amplified virus stock for 2 h. After two washes with PBS,

Statistical analyses. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8. Differences between the IFNs

231

were tested using a nonparametric two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a multiple

232

comparison using the Friedman test. Pearson correlation coefficients (R2) values were computed

233

for linear regression analyses. Paired analysis of two isolates against multiple IFNs were

234

performed using a nonparametric, two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs rank test. Differences with

235

p<0.05 were considered significant. Nonlinear regression curves were fit using a two-phase

236

exponential decay equation on log-transformed data.

Figure 3 | Correlation between SARS-CoV-2 inhibition and biological properties of IFNα

274

subtypes. Log-transformed IFN-inhibition values relative to mock for the 5 different SARS-CoV-

275

2 strains were compared to previously published values on (a) 50% effective concentrations in the

276

iLite assay, a reporter cell line encoding the IFN sensitive response element of ISG15 linked to

277

firefly luciferase23; (b) IFNΑR2 subunit binding affinity, as measured by surface plasmon

278

resonance by the Schreiber group24; and (c) HIV-1 inhibition values, based on % inhibition of

279

HIV-1 p24+ gut lymphocytes relative to mock as measured by flow cytometry3. Each dot

280

corresponds to an IFNα subtype. Linear regression was performed using GraphPad Prism 8.

281

Significant correlations (p<0.05) were highlighted with a red best-fit line; those that were trending

282

(p<0.1) had a gray, dotted best-fit line.

295

a second B.1.1.7 isolate from the United Kingdom (UK), England/204820464/2020. A549-ACE2

296

cells were pre-treated with serial 10-fold dilutions of IFNs for 18 h in triplicate and then infected

297

with SARS-CoV-2. Supernatants were collected after 24 h, SARS-CoV-2 N1 copy numbers were

298

determined by qPCR, and then normalized against mock as 100%. Non-linear best-fit regression
