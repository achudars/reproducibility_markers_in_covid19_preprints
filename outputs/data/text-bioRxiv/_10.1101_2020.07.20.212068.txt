ABSTRACT
The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, and the closely related SARS-CoV coronavirus
enter cells by binding at the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The stronger hACE2 affinity of SARS-CoV-2 has
been connected with its higher infectivity. In this work, we study hACE2 complexes with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of
the human SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV viruses, using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Computational
Protein Design (CPD) with a physics-based energy function. The MD simulations identify charge-modifying substitutions between
the CoV-2 and CoV RBDs, which either increase or decrease the hACE2 affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The combined effect
of these mutations is small, and the relative affinity is mainly determined by substitutions at residues in contact with hACE2. Many
of these findings are in line and interpret recent experiments. Our CPD calculations redesign positions 455, 493, 494 and 501 of
the SARS-CoV-2 RBM, which contact hACE2 in the complex and are important for ACE2 recognition. Sampling is enhanced by
an adaptive importance sampling Monte Carlo method. Sequences with increased affinity replace CoV-2 glutamine by a negative
residue at position 493, and serine by nonpolar, aromatic or a threonine at position 494. Substitutions at positions positions 455
and 501 have a smaller effect on affinity. Substitutions suggested by our design are seen in viral sequences encountered in other
species, including bat and pangolin. Our results might be used to identify potential virus strains with higher human infectivity and
assist in the design of peptide-based or peptidomimetic compounds with the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 binding at hACE2.

SIGNIFICANCE The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 and
the earlier, closely related SARS-CoV virus bind at the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor at
the cell surface. The higher human infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 may be linked to its stronger affinity for hACE2. Here, we
study by computational methods complexes of hACE2 with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of viruses SARS-CoV-2
and SARS-CoV. We identify residues affecting the affinities of the two domains for hACE2. We also propose mutations
at key SARS-CoV-2 positions, which might enhance hACE2 affinity. Such mutations may appear in viral strains with
increased human infectivity and might assist the design of peptide-based compounds that inhibit infection of human cells
by SARS-CoV-2.

INTRODUCTION
Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses responsible for respiratory, gastrointestinal and central nervous
system diseases in various avian and mammalian species (1). The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus caused acute respiratory
syndrome and pneumonia in humans at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since caused a pandemic responsible for over
13 million confirmed cases and 500000 deaths (early July 2020). In addition to SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses able to infect
humans are the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERSCoV), which appeared, respectively, in 2002 and 2012, and the mild-symptom viruses HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E (2, 3).
SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV and the bat CoV ZC45, RmYNo2, RaTG13, sharing with them a nucleotide
sequence identity of 79.5%, 89.1%, 93.3%, and 96.2%, respectively (4–6).
Receptor binding and membrane fusion are key initial steps in the coronavirus infection cycle. Entry into host cells is
mediated via the viral spike (S) protein, which forms large protuberances at the virus surface and gives the crown (corona)
appearance to the coronaviruses. The S protein (reviewed in (7)) consists of an ectodomain, a transmembrane domain and
an intracellular tail. The ectodomain contains a receptor-binding subunit (S1) and a membrane-fusion subunit (S2). During

virus entry, the S1 subunit binds to a receptor on the host cell surface and the S2 subunit fuses the host and viral membranes,
allowing viral genomes to enter host cells (7).
The host receptor of the human SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S1 subunits is the human angiotensin converting enzyme
2 (hACE2) (5, 8, 9). The crystallographic structures of various complexes involving the receptor binding domain (RBD)
of SARS-CoV strains from different host species and the ACE2 receptor from various animal species have been described
earlier (1, 10–13). Recently, the cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer (14) and crystallographic structures of the
complex between hACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (15, 16) have been determined.
The above structural studies and additional biochemical experiments have provided insights on the similarities and
differences of the two complexes. The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs have similar folds, with an RMSD of 1.2 Å
between Cα atoms (15, 16). Overall, the RBD sequences differ at 48 positions, with 34 differences located in the RBMs. Eight
preserved residues and six residues with similar physicochemical properties are located in structurally equivalent positions
and form similar contacts with hACE2 (Figure 1). CoV-2/CoV positions L455/Y442, F486/L472, Q493/N479, S494/D480
and N501/T487 affect the recognition of the ACE2 receptor and the range of hosts infected by the SARS-CoV virus (12, 16).
Residues L455/Y442, S494/D480 and Q493/N479 are located near key salt bridge K31-E35 (“hotspot 31”) on the hACE
receptor. N501/T487 interact with a second key hACE2 salt bridge D38-K353 (“hotspot 353”). The remaining differences
are at positions not in direct contact with hACE2. A large number contain charge modifications, which perturb long-range
interactions with the negatively charged hACE2, and might contribute to the relative affinity of the complexes.
The stronger affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein for hACE2 may be linked to the higher human infectivity of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus (15, 16). The differences between the two RBMs contribute to changes in the affinities of the two complexes.
It is thus important to identify residues that contribute to the observed differences in affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
RBDs for hACE2, and search for mutations that might enhance the SARS-CoV-2 affinity.
In the present work, we study complexes of the hACE2 receptor with the RBDs of the human SARS-CoV-2 and human
SARS-CoV viruses. In what follows, we refer to these complexes as “the CoV-2 complex” and “the CoV complex”, respectively.
Using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we evaluate the contributions of the various RBD and hACE2 residues
to the affinities of the two complexes. Several charge-modifying substitutions at remote positions in the CoV-2 RBD tend to
stabilize or destabilize the CoV-2 complex relative to the CoV complex, but their combined effect is small; thus, the relative
affinity is mainly determined by mutations at positions, which contact hACE2 in the CoV-2 complex.
We also perform exhaustive computational sequence design (CPD) calculations at key positions 455, 493, 494 and 501
of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM. The CPD calculations employ a physics-based energy function and a recent methodology for the
flattening of the sequence space landscape (17–19) that is closely analogous to the Wang-Landau approach (20). The top
affinity sequences contain a glutamic or aspartic acid at position 493, in place of glutamine, and nonpolar, aromatic or polar
(threonine) residues at position 494, in place of serine. Substitutions at positions 455 and 501 have a smaller effect on affinity;
thus CoV-2 residues L455 and N501 seem to be already optimal choices. Some of the observed substitutions are see in virus
sequences encountered in bat and pangolin. Our results might be used to identify potential virus strains with increased hACE2
affinity, or peptides and peptidomimetic compounds with the potential to inhibit the CoV-2 S1:hACE2 complex.

METHODS
Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Simulation systems

We investigated complexes of human ACE2 with the SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBDs. The crystal structures (PDB ID
2AJF (16) and 6M0J (15)) contain the hACE2 segment 323 - 502, the SARS-CoV2 segment 333-526, the SARS-CoV segment
323 - 502, Asn-linked glycans (N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine molecules) at positions 53 (SARS-CoV complex), 90, 322, 546 in
hACE2, position 330 in SARS CoV, position 343 in SARS-CoV-2, two metal ions Zn++ and Cl- , and numerous water molecules.
The structures were truncated by deleting hACE2 residues or SARS-CoV-2(CoV) residues located more than 25 Å from
SARS-CoV-2(CoV) or hACE2, respectively. The resulting complexes contained hACE2 segments 19-109, 293-421, 547-565,
SARS-CoV segments 326-343, 353-368, 384-499 (RBM) and SARS-CoV-2 segments 339-356, 366-381, 397-513 (RBM)
and had 6250-6251 protein atoms. The zinc ions, all glycans and crystallographic waters within 4 Å from the complexes were
retained. The disulphide bridges C344-C361 in hACE2, C366-C419, C467-C474 in SARS-CoV, and C379-C432, C480-C488
in SARS-CoV-2 were also retained. Acetylated and N-methylated blocking groups were respectively attached at the N- and
C-terminal ends of the proteins. Titratable residues were assigned their most common ionization state at physiological pH, with
the exception of hACE2 residue Asp382, which was protonated. In both crystallographic complexes, residues Asp382 and
Asp350 are in direct contact (Cβ -Cβ ∼ 4 Å) and their interactions with nearby residues and a crystallographic water (∼ 3.5 Å)
suggest that one of them is protonated. Calculations with the empirical model Propka (21) predicted highly elevated pKa values

SARS-CoV-2 optimization for human ACE2

(8.8-9.7 for Asp382 and 6.6-6.0 for Asp350), suggesting that Asp382 is protonated.
The two complexes were solvated in a truncated octahedral box of explicit water molecules; the hydration layer around each
complex had a minimal width of 13 Å. Potassium ions were included to neutralize the simulation systems. Initial hydrogen
atom coordinates were determined by the HBUILD facility (22). All system setups were performed with the CHARMM-GUI
interface (23).
Equilibration and production simulations

The solvated systems were first subjected to 800 steps of conjugate-gradient minimization. Protein and glycan heavy atoms
and the Zn ion were harmonically restrained, with restraint constants gradually varied from 10 to 2 kcal/mol/Å2 ; this was
followed by 200 adopted-basis Newton-Raphson minimization steps, with 1.0 kcal/mol/Å2 restraint constants on backbone
heavy atoms and 0.1 kcal/mol/Å2 on sidechain heavy atoms. Additional dihedral restraints ensured that glycans kept their sugar
conformation.
Following minimization, each system was equilibrated by an 1-ns simulation in the NPT ensemble at 300 K, with harmonic
restraints applied on backbone and side chain heavy atoms. The simulation was divided into six segments with lengths of 3x100
ps, 2x150 ps and 400 ps, in which the harmonic restraints were gradually reduced from 10 kcal/mol/Å2 on all protein heavy
atoms to 0.5 kcal/mol/Å2 on main chain atoms. In the last segment the time step was increased from 1.0-fs to 1.5-fs to 2.0-fs.
The production simulations were performed in the NPT ensemble with the NAMD program (24). All protein heavy atoms
located more than 15 Å from the hACE2 or SARS-CoV-2/CoV segments were retained near their initial positions by harmonic
restraints. The restraint constant was set to 0.4 kcal/mol/Å2 to reproduce vibrational thermal motions, as reflected by the
crystallographic B-factors ( 65 Å2 ).
The system temperature was controlled by Langevin dynamics at 300 K, with a friction coefficient of 5 ps-1 . The pressure
was kept constant at 1 atm using a Nose-Hoover Langevin piston with a period of 200 ps (25, 26). Atomic interactions were
modeled by the CHARMM36 energy function (27). The water solvent was represented by the TIP3P model (28–30). Long-range
electrostatic interactions were described (every 2 steps) by the Particle Mesh Ewald method (31) using the r-RESPA multiple
time-step method (32) and a general cutoff distance at 12 Å for all non-bonded interactions. We performed 3 production runs
from different starting structures. Each run had a time-step of 2 fs and a total duration of 41 ns; post-processing analysis was
performed with 4000 snapshots, extracted at 10-ps intervals from the last 40 ns of each trajectory.
Estimation of binding affinities

The total effective energies were expressed as the sum of molecular mechanics (MM) and solvation (solv) terms:
EX = (EXbonded + EXvdw + EXCoulomb ) + (EXGB + EXSA + EXDI ) ≡ EMM + Esolv

(1)

where X is the system under consideration (the complex C or the dissociated proteins P1 and P2). The MM energy terms
correspond to bonded, van der Waals (vdw) and Coulombic interactions. The continuum electrostatic generalized Born (GB)
term EXGB models the interaction of the solute charges with the solvent polarization. The term EXSA takes into account the
tendency of solute atoms to be exposed or hidden from solvent via a surface area (SA) term. The term EXDI incorporates
solute-water attractive dispersion interactions (33–36).
To compute these terms, we extracted 12000 coordinate frames at 10-ps intervals and removed all waters and ions. We
employed the “single-trajectory” approximation, according to which the two proteins have identical conformations in the
complex and unbound states. The binding affinities are
∆Ebind = E Coulomb + E vdw + ∆E GB + ∆E SA + ∆E DI

(2)

with E Coulomb and E vdw the intermolecular Coulomb and vdw energies. Bonded and intramolecular vdw and Coulomb energies
are identical in the complex and unbound proteins and do not appear in Eq. 2. The binding affinities do not take into account
changes in the translational, rotational and vibrational/conformational entropies of the two proteins upon association. These
terms are expected to cancel to a large extent in the relative affinities for molecules of comparable sizes, such as the CoV-2 and
CoV RBDs (37, 38).

Optimization of the CoV-2 RBM affinity for hACE2
Design positions

We designed key positions 455, 493, 494 and 501 in the CoV-2 RBM, to improve affinity for hACE2. The design calculations
were conducted with the program Proteus (19, 39).
Design scaffold

The system used in the design resulted from the all-atom simulation CoV-2 complex, after removing glycans, metal ions and
water molecules. The resulting complex contained 239 hACE2 residues and 157 SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues.
The initial atomic coordinates were taken from the crystallographic structure (15) and were subjected to 1000 steps of
minimization. During design, positions 455, 493 and 494 were allowed to sample 18 chemical types (A, I, L, V, M, K, R,
D, E, N, Q, C, S, T, F, Y, W, H(Nδ )). Position 501 sampled 14 types; bulky sidechains F, Y, W, H were excluded, due to
steric repulsions. These selections resulted in 183 × 14 = 81648 possible sequences. All chemical types sampled sidechain
conformations from a discrete rotamer library (40), augmented to include orientations seen in the PDB structure of the CoV-2
complex (15). 53 SARS-CoV-2 and 108 hACE2 side chains (excluding glycine and proline residues) within 15 Å of hACE2
retained the SARS-CoV-2 chemical type and sampled conformations from the same library. The remaining atoms (the entire
protein backbone, including the N- and C-terminal blocking groups, cysteine residues in disulphide bridges, all glycines and
prolines and all other sidechains farther than 15 Å from the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 interface) were kept fixed.
Interaction Energy Matrix

The interaction energies of all side chain-backbone and sidechain-sidechain pairs, for all possible side-chain chemical types
and rotamers, were pre-computed and stored in an Interaction Energy Matrix. The energy function was given from Eq. 1. The
GB term corresponded to the Hawkins-Cramer-Truhlar Generalized Born (GB/HCT) approximation (41–43). It was rendered
pair-wise decomposable via the Native Environment Approximation (NEA), that is described in (44–46). According to this
approximation, the atomic solvation coefficients bi of each residue are precalculated, with the rest of the system kept at the
native sequence and conformation. The water and protein dielectric constants were set to 80.0 and 6.8; the atomic surface
coefficients of non-polar, polar, ionic and aromatic atoms were set to σalk = −5 cal/mol, σpol =-8 cal/mol, σion =-9 cal/mol,
σaro =-12 cal/mol (33).

Adaptive flattening of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD apo state

We first performed a design simulation of the unbound SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain, in which we derived bias potentials
that rendered all allowed chemical types at positions 455, 493, 494 and 501 equiprobable. The procedure is analogous to
the Wang-Landau approach (20) and has been described in detail in refs (17–19). At a particular simulation time t, the bias
potentials have the form
E B (s1 (t), s2 (t), . . . , s k (t)) =

k
X
i=1

EiB (s i (t); t) +

k
X

EiBj (s i (t), s j (t); t).

(4)

i > j=1

The above sums are over the four mutable positions; s i (t) is the sidechain type at position i at simulation time t; EiB (s i (t)) is
the biasing potential for sidechain type s i at position i, and EiBj (s i (t), s j (t); t) is the biasing potential for pairs of side-chain
types s i and s j at positions i and j, at simulation time t.
The bias potentials are updated at regular time intervals T. During an update at simulation time t = nT, the sequence
s1 (nT ), . . . , s k (nT ) is penalized by adding the following energy increments to the corresponding bias potentials:
eiB (s i (nT ); nT )

(6)

where e0 and E 0 are constants with the dimension of energy. As the simulation proceeds, the biasing potentials grow (with
exponentially decreasing increments), reducing the probabilities of frequently appearing sequences and flattening the sequence

where δ a,b is Kronecker’s delta.
In the current work, the bias potentials were updated every 1000 MC steps. The parameters e0 and E0 were respectively set
to 0.2 kcal/mol and 100 kcal/mol for single-position biases and 0.1 kcal/mol, 40 kcal/mol for two-position biases. The biases
were updated via 3 × 108 MC steps of the free SARS-CoV-2 at a temperature of 300 K, using single- and double-position
moves.
Biased simulations of the ACE2 complex

The resulting biased potentials are approximately equal to the negative folding energies of the apo (A) SARS-CoV-2 RBD state
(18). Using the same biasing potentials, a second design simulation is conducted for the CoV-2 complex (C). Since the biasing
potentials subtract from the free energies of the complex the unbound-protein free energies, the design promotes the selection
of sequences with good binding affinities. The populations pC (S) and p A (S) of a sequence S in the simulations of the complex
and the apo states are used to compute the binding free energy of a sequence S relative to a reference sequence Sref :
∆∆Gbind (S) = −k B T ln

p A (S)
pC (S)
+ k B T ln
.
pC (Sref )
p A (Sref )

(9)

The probabilities entering Eq. 9 are biased. However, if the same biasing potentials are used in the design simulations of the
apo state and the complex (as done here), the biasing terms cancel out in the binding free energies (18). Thus, Eq. 9 yields the
unbiased binding free energy of sequence S relative to a reference sequence Sref (e.g., the native SARS-CoV-2 sequence).
Details of MC simulations

The biasing MC simulations of the apo SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the CoV-2 complex had a length of 109 Replica Exchange
Monte Carlo steps. We employed four replicas at kT = 0.6 kcal/mol, 0.9 kcal/mol, 1.3 kcal/mol and 1.8 kcal/mol; swaps
between neighboring replicas were attempted every 2000 MC steps. The simulation started from a randomly selected sequence/conformation state using the random number generator routine mt19937 from GSL. Side chains more than 7 Å from
any atom of the 4 mutable positions were retained to their initial conformations. At each MC step, a chemical type/rotamer
modification was randomly chosen at one or two positions. The associated energy difference was computed by the IEM, and
the modification was accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis criterion (47). The frequencies of attempted changes
were as follows: one-position rotamer changes 57% and chemical-type changes 11%, two-position rotamer/rotamer changes
23%, type/rotamer changes 6% and type/type changes 3%. Residue pairs with interaction energies smaller in absolute value
than 3 kcal/mol were not considered for two-position changes. At the end of the simulation, sequences were collected from the
0.6 kcal/mol replica for analysis.

All-atom MD simulations of the CoV-2 and CoV complexes
Description of the crystallographic CoV-2 and CoV complexes

Figure 1(a) displays the crystallographic structures of the two complexes. The CoV-2 RBD spans the S1 protein region 333-526
and is folded into an antiparallel, five-strand β-sheet (strands β1, β2, β3, β4, β7), connected via three short helices (α1, α2, α3)
and loops; recognition of the hACE2 receptor is achieved via region 438-506 (the receptor binding motif or RBM), that is
inserted between strands β4 and β7 and consists of two short strands (β5 and β6), two helices (α4, α5) and loops (15, 16, 48). In
SARS-CoV, the corresponding RBD extends in the region T425-S492 and the RBM in the region T425-Q492.
A sequence alignment of the CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs is included in Figure 1(b); aligned residues occupy structurally
equivalent positions in the two RBDs. Using a cut-off distance of 4 Å, 17 SARS-CoV-2 residues and 16 SARS-CoV residues in
the two RBMs form crystallographic intermolecular contacts with hACE2 (8, 15, 16). Eight CoV-2/CoV residues are identical
(Y449/Y436, Y453/Y440, N487/473, Y489/Y475, G496/G482, T500/T486, G502/G488, Y505/Y491) and six residues are
modified, but retain similar biochemical properties (L455/Y442, F456/L443, F486/L472, Q493/N479, Q498/Y484, N501/T487).

These residues form similar hydrogen-bonding or nonpolar contacts with hACE2 (Table 1). Hotspot-31 residue K31 contacts
the structurally equivalent residues Y489/Y475. At hotspot 353, residue D38 forms a hydrogen bond with the structurally

with Y505/Y491.

Structurally equivalent residues in the CoV-2 and CoV RBMs
are included in the same row. Designed positions are in bold.
“sc” and “mc” denote hydrogen-bonds involving side chain and
mainchain atoms, respectively; “np” and “p” denote contacts
involving nonpolar and polar moieties.

The RBD sequences contain also charge-modifying substitutions at positions not in direct contact with hACE2 in the
complexes. CoV-2/CoV substitutions K444/T431, K458/H445, G476/D463 and S994/D480 introduce a positive charge or
eliminate a negative charge in the COV-2 RBM; substitutions N439/R426, L452/K439, N460/K447, E471/V458, T478/K465,
E484/P471 eliminate a positive charge or insert a negative charge (Figure 1). As discussed below, residues at these positions
form longer-range polar interactions with hACE2 and contribute to the affinities of the two complexes.
Interactions in the MD simulations of the CoV-2 and CoV complexes

The intermolecular crystallographic contacts of Tables 1-2 were maintained in the simulations, with the exception of CoV-2
contact F456-D30 that was replaced by L455-D30. Some new intermolecular contacts were also observed. CoV-2/CoV residues
A475/P462 formed contacts with Q24 and T27; residues G476/P462 formed a new contact with S19. An extended hydrophobic
packing was observed near hotspot 353, involving T500/T486, N501/T487, G502/G488, Y505/Y491 and ACE2 residues N330,
K353, G354, D355. New intermolecular contacts only in the CoV-2 complex involved residue pairs G476-Q24 and G496-D38;
in the CoV complex, new contacts involved pairs N473-Q24 and G488-T324. Overall, the CoV-2 RBD formed 21 non-polar
contacts with hACE2, compared to 20 contacts in the CoV complex. The two hotspots (intermolecular hACE2 salt bridges
K31-E35 and D38-K353) were very stable, with occupancies in the range 100%-85%.
Statistics of intermolecular hydrogen-bonds are collected in Table 3. Residues N487/N473 form two hydrogen bonds with
Y83 and Q24, residues Y489/Y475 form a second hydrogen bond with Y83, G502/G488 a hydrogen bond with K353, and
T500/T486 with Y41. In general, common hydrogen bonds are more stable in the CoV-2 simulations. The intermolecular salt
bridge K417-D30 (54.5% occupancy) and the hydrogen bonds K31-Q493 (27.6%), E35-Q493 (51.5%), K353-G496 (66.4

%) and K353-Q498 (34.6%) are only observed in the CoV-2 complex. In the CoV complex, hotspot-31 residues do not form
intermolecular hydrogen-bonds; K353 forms a single hydrogen bond with G488 (45.2% occupancy) and D38 forms three
infrequent hydrogen bonds with residues N479, Y436 and Y484 (occupancies 29.3%-15.4%).
Residue interaction energy analysis of the CoV-2 and CoV complexes

Figure 2 displays difference values for selected residue intermolecular energies in the CoV-2 and CoV complexes. Negative
values indicate stronger intermolecular interactions in the CoV-2 complex. Values at non-conserved positions show whether a
specific substitution improves or weakens intermolecular interactions. The energies are averaged over three independent 40-ns
MD trajectories of each complex, with the standard deviation of the means in error bars.
The CoV-2/CoV residue profiles are shown in Figure 2(a). We first discuss the differences in the electrostatic (Coulomb+GB)
intermolecular energies. Substitutions K417/V403, K444/T431, K458/H445, G476/D463, S994/D480 increase the positivecharge of the CoV-2 RBD and strengthen interactions with the excess negative charge of the hACE2 receptor (11 positively and
14 negatively charged hACE2 residues are located within 15 Å of the CoV-2 RBM). Substitutions N439/R426, L452/K439,
N460/K447, E471/V458, T478/K465, E484/P471 reduce the positive charge and weaken interactions with hACE2. These
residues are shown in Figure 1(a). With the exception of K417 (forming a salt-bridge with CoV-2 S30), R426 (hydrogen-bonded
to Q325 and E329 in CoV) and D463 (interacting with CoV S19), other positions do not contact hACE2. Due to cancellations
among the above residue components, their total contribution to the relative affinity is small (-0.4 kcal/mol). Additional negative
contributions are due to charge-preserving substitutions Q493/N479 (-0.7 kcal/mol), Q498/Y484 (-1.0 kcal/mol), and conserved
residues N487 (-0.4 kcal/mol), G496 (-0.6 kcal/mol). All these residues form more stable hydrogen bonds with hACE2 in the
CoV-2 simulations (Table 3).
With respect to vdw interactions, the most negative contribution is associated with substitution F486/L472, due to improved

contacts of F486 with hACE2 residues L79, M82 and Y83. The most positive value is due to substitution Q498/Y484; in the
CoV simulations, Y484 forms better intermolecular interactions with Y41.
The above analysis shows that charge-modifying substitutions between the CoV and CoV-2 RBDs do not always favor
the CoV-2 complex, but tend to cancel each other and contribute little to the relative affinity of the CoV-2 complex. Some
substitutions may be chosen for stability reasons, as they eliminate or create pairs of opposite charges at or near salt-bridge
distances (Figure 1(a)): the CoV pairs D463-K465, K439-D480 and H445-V458 are transformed to G476-T478, L452-S494

and K458-E471 in CoV-2. Overall, the observed charge balance prevents the accumulation of excessive positive charge on the
SARS-CoV-2 RBM and might help the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein to escape recognition by molecules other than the hACE2
receptor. Instead, the improved CoV-2 S1 affinity for hACE2 relies mainly on substitutions at the interface of the CoV-2
complex, notably K417/V404 and F486/L472.
The difference profiles of selected hACE2 residues are displayed in Figure 2(b). Most electrostatic components are small,
suggesting that the majority of hACE2 residues do not differentiate significantly between the CoV and CoV-2 RBDs, even
if they are charged. This can be attributed to the fact that the CoV-2 and CoV RBMs have similar net charges (respectively
+1 and +2 within 15 Å of hACE2). Thus, maintaining a constant charge might assist the virus RBM to prevent recognition

SARS-CoV-2 optimization for human ACE2

by molecules other than hACE2. The largest (in absolute value) negative electrostatic contributions are associated with D30
(hydrogen-bonds with K417), hotspot-31 K31 (hydrogen-bonds to Q493) and hotspot-353 K353 (hydrogen bonds to G496,
Q498 and G502). The largest negative vdw energies are associated with K31, L79, M82 and Y83. Lysine K31 makes more
favourable vdw interactions with CoV-2 residues F490 and F456. The other three residues form a hydrophobic pocket that
makes improved non polar contacts with CoV-2 residue F486.
Using Eq. 2, we estimate that the CoV-2 complex has a lower total binding affinity by 4.0±2.4 kcal/mol. The corresponding
experimental estimate is in the range -0.9 to -1.1 kcal/mol, based on the reported dissociation constants in (15, 16). Thus, the
computational estimate ranks correctly the two complexes, but overestimates somewhat the relative CoV-2 affinity.

Computational optimization of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM
We optimized the SARS-CoV-2 composition at RBM positions 455, 493, 494 and 501, searching for mutants with improved
binding affinity for hACE2. Residues at these positions interact with the “hotspot” intramolecular salt-bridges K31-E35, K353D38 on the hACE2 α1 helix, and have been characterized as critical for the recognition of hACE2 (15, 16). The methodology is
outlined in the methods.
Design and filtering procedure

Step 1: Flattening of the energy landscape of the apo CoV-2 RBD. We first derived bias potentials that flattened the
sequence landscape at positions 455, 493, 494 and 501 of of the apo SARS-CoV2 RBD. Figure 3(a) displays a logo of the
sequence composition after flattening the landscape. All 18 chemical types were accepted at positions 455, 493, 494 and all 14
allowed chemical types were accepted at position 501. A total of 81643 out of 81648 possible sequences were sampled in the
simulations, with 60660 sequences appearing more than 5000 times. The CoV-2 wt sequence “LQSN" was selected 15651
times, and the CoV wt sequence “YNDT” 1264 times.
Step 2: Biased simulations of the apo CoV-2 RBD and the CoV-2 complex. The above bias potentials approximate the
negative free energies of the apo CoV-2 RBD (18). Using these potentials, a second design simulation was conducted with the
CoV-2 complex. Since the biasing potentials subtract the apo from the complex free energies, the design promotes sequences
with good binding affinities. In the calculations of the CoV-2 complex, a total of 29668 out of 81648 sequences were sampled,
with 6350 sequences appearing more than 5000 times. The CoV-2 sequence L455/Q493/S494/N501 (LQSN) was sampled
6347 times, whereas the CoV sequence Y455/N493/D494/T501 was not sampled. A total of 5596 common sequences were
visited at least 5000 times in the simulations of the complex and apo state. Using Eq. 9, we estimated that 4704 out of the 5596
sequences had better binding affinity than the native sequence.
Discussion of the designed sequences

Figure 3(b) displays a logo with the composition of the 4704 sequences with improved affinities relative to the CoV-2 sequence
LQSN. The resulting chemical types are Boltzmann-weighted by the sequence binding affinities; large letters signify types
most frequently encountered in the highest-affinity sequences. Position 455 is most frequently occupied by a leucine (L) as
in the CoV-2 RBM, a glutamine (Q) or a glutamic acid (E); position 493 is occupied by negatively charged aminoacids (D,
E), position 494 by hydrophobic (I, V), aromatic (W) and polar (N) aminoacids, and position 501 by V, T (as in the CoV
RBM) and N (as in the CoV-2 RBM). Figure 4(a) lists the 20 highest-affinity sequences. The top sequence is the triple mutant
L455/E493/I494/V501 (LEIV).
Figure 4(b) displays the highest-affinity sequences, organized in terms of their similarity with the CoV-2 sequence. Singlepoint mutants are listed in the leftmost column. The best three sequences contain the mutations Q493E/D or S494I; each of the
three mutations is predicted to improve the CoV-2 affinity for hACE2 by 1.6–2.2 kcal/mol. Position 494 displays the highest
variability, with eight point mutations. Most favorable choices insert nonpolar (isoleucine, valine) or aromatic (tryptophane)
sidechains, or substitute CoV-2 serine by another polar aminoacid (asparagine). At positions 455 and 501, mutations are sparse
and have a weak effect on affinity. Mutations L455E and N501V improve affinity by 0.7–0.6 kcal/mol; a small improvement in
affinity (0.3 kcal/mol) is also predicted for the mutation N501T, which restores at that position the chemical type encountered
in the CoV RBD.
The top 15 double-mutants are displayed in the second column of Figure 4(b). Most sequences result from a combination
of the best single-point mutations, i.e. contain residues E/D at position 493 and residues I, V and W at position 494. The best
double mutant (LEIN) is among the four top sequences Figure 4(a), with a relative affinity of -4.6 kcal/mol.
The top triple mutants are displayed in the next-to-last column of Fig. 4(b). The top mutants combine the 493E/D and
494I residues encountered in the best double mutants LEIN, LDIN with the V and T substitutions seen at position 501 of the
single-point mutants. Sequence LEIV has the best affinity overall (-5.1 kcal/mol).

The best quadruple mutants are included in the last column of Figure 4(b). Several mutants contain an L to Q substitution at
position 455 that either maintains affinity at the same level or makes it slightly smaller; for example, sequences QEIV and

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The present study compared complexes of the human ACE2 receptor and the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV S1 proteins by all-atom MD simulations and searched for sequence substitutions at positions 455, 493, 494 and
501 of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD, which might increase the virus affinity for hACE2.
Using all-atom simulations and interaction energy decomposition, we quantified contributions of the various CoV, CoV-2
and hACE2 residues on the affinities of the two complexes. Since hACE2 is negatively charged, positively charged residues
are expected to favor and negatively charged residues to disfavor association. Indeed, substitutions K417/V404, K444/T431,
K458/H445, G476/D463, S494/D480 inserted a positive charge or eliminated a negative charge at the CoV-2 RBD and favor
the CoV-2 complex; substitutions N439/R426, L452/K439, N460/K447, E471/V458, T478/K465, E484/P471 eliminated a
positive charge or inserted a negative charge and had the opposite effect.
In general, it might be expected that the accumulation of positive charge in the CoV-2 RBM would be favored, since it
would increase the affinity for the negatively charged hACE2 receptor. Nevertheless, the above substitutions decrease the CoV-2
charge by one unit, relative to CoV, and have a small total effect on the relative affinity (the total electrostatic intermolecular
interaction energy of these residues is -0.4 kcal/mol in favor the CoV-2 complex). The lack of accumulation of a large positive
charge might help the RBMs escape recognition from other molecules than the ACE2 receptor. Furthermore, some of the above
substitutions create or eliminate salt-bridge forming residues and might be favored for stability reasons. Instead, the improved

recognition of hACE2 by the S1 RBM seems to rely mostly on substitutions at the interface of the complex. In the CoV-2
complex, such substitutions increasing the CoV-2 affinity are K417/V404 and F486/L473. The former introduces the salt bridge
K417-D30 and the latter improves nonpolar interactions with a hydrophobic pocket consisting of hACE2 residues L79, M82
and Y83.
Residue component differences are only indicative of changes in affinity due to these substitutions. Nevertheless, many of
the above conclusions are in line with a recent experimental study, which examined the impact of CoV substitutions at the
CoV-2 RBM (16). Substitutions N439R, L452K, E484P and Q498Y were shown to increase and F486L to decrease the affinity
of the CoV-2 complex; charge-modifying mutations E471V and S494D had an insignificant effect; thus, charge changes at
some RBD positions might have a smaller impact on affinity.
Using protein computational design methods, we next examined systematically a large number of substitutions at positions
455, 493, 494 and 501 of the CoV-2 RBM, which have been evaluated as important for ACE2 recognition and cross-species
transmission (13, 16). Main improvements in affinity are associated with the introduction of negative residues (E, D) at position
493 and nonpolar (I, V) or aromatic (W) at position 494; the polar CoV-2 serine can also be substituted by asparagine at that
position. Insertions of a valine or the CoV threonine at position 501 yield small improvements on the affinity. The CoV-2
leucine is maintained at position 455, in sequences of high affinity; insertion of a glutamic acid at this position is only seen in
conjunction with mutations at other places, without improvement in affinity.
We analyzed some complexes containing the above substitutions by 10-ns all-atom MD simulations. Figure 5(a) shows a
representative simulation structure of the complex with the highest affinity triple mutant LEIV. E493 forms a stable hydrogen
bond with K31, without perturbing the hotspot-31 salt bridge K31-E35. The I494 sidechain stays in proximity of the D38
sidechain (the average distance I494(CB)-D38(CB) ∼ 7 Å) and forms two stable intramolecular nonpolar contacts with
Y449 and L452. The I494-L452 contact replaces the structurally equivalent contacts S494-L452 and D480-K439, observed
respectively in the CoV-2 and CoV RBM. The hotspot salt-bridge D38-K353 and the intermolecular salt-bridge K417-D30
are also maintained. V501 makes a non polar contact and Q498 a hydrogen bond with the K353 sidechain. L455 contacts the
nonpolar moiety of K31.
A second interesting case is the EEIV mutant, which contains two negatively charged residues at positions 455 and 493.
Figure 5(b) shows a representative simulation structure of the corresponding complex. E455 forms two stable intermolecular
hydrogen bonds with K31 and H34 and an intramolecular hydrogen bond with Y453. E493 forms a second stable hydrogen
bond with K31, without disrupting the salt-bridges K31-E35 and K417-D30. The I494 sidechain forms similar interactions as

in the LEIN complex. The Y449 sidechain forms hydrogen bonds with D38 and Q42. The Q42 sidechain is oriented toward
Q498, forming two simultaneous hydrogen bonds with it. Another hydrogen bond is formed between Q498 and K353. The

SARS-CoV-2 optimization for human ACE2

tryptophane substitution at position 494. The W494 sidechain is oriented towards ACE2, forming a hydrogen bond with D38.
Figure 4(c) shows the composition at positions 455, 493, 494 and 501 (CoV-2 numbering) in various viral strains encountered
in other species than human (16). The Pangolin (GD) sequence composition is identical to SARS-CoV-2. Among the other
sequences, only the Pangolin (GX) sequence 455L/493E/494R/501T was predicted by our design to have better affinity than
CoV-2 (2.9 kcal/mol). Note though that the Pangolin (GX) RBM contains several additional substitutions with respect to CoV-2,
including mutations K417V, F486L and Q498H at positions contacting hACE2. The total effect of all these substitutions might
be to reduce affinity for hACE2 below the CoV-2 affinity.
At position 455, some of the coronavirus sequences of Figure 4(c), substitute L with S, R, W and Y. Among these types, an
arginine is predicted in some of our designed sequences. The best sequence is REIV, with a relative affinity of -2.8 kcal/mol.
Reconstruction of the designed conformation shows that R455 can form an intermolecular salt-bridge with E35 and an
intramolecular salt-bridge with E493.
At position 493, the coronavirus sequences of Figure 4(c), substitute L with E, Y, K, A, R, S. Among these types, we
frequently encounter a tyrosine residue in our design. The best such sequence is LYIV, with an affinity of -2.8 kcal/mol. The
bat (RatG13) sequence LYRD also contains a tyrosine at this position. Our design predicts the closely related sequence LYRT,
with an affinity of -0.3 kcal/mol.
At position 501, several coronavirus sequences of Figure 4(c) contain mainly small polar side chains (N,T,S) and three of
the bat sequences contain a V or D residue. In our designed sequences, V, T and N are the most frequently encountered choices
in sequences of high-affinity. Our design inserts a threonine residue in the best and in 12 out of the 20 top-binding sequences.
In accord with this, the substitution N501T was recently shown in ref (50) to improve the CoV-2 affinity for hACE2.
In conclusion, the computational protein design calculations predict that the combinations (E, D)493 /(I, V, N, W)494 /(V, T,
N)501 might increase the SARS-CoV-2 affinity for hACE2. All-atom MD simulations show that the above substitutions create
new intermolecular salt-bridges or hydrogen bonds, without disrupting the hotspots 31 and 353, or the salt-bridge K417-D30.
The introduction of an E sidechain at position 455 creates a hydrogen bond with H34. E or Q sidechains at position 493 form a
hydrogen bonds with K31. The introduction of I, V and W sidechains at position 494 creates a nonpolar patch and promotes
association; the W sidechain is positioned between D38 and E35, forming a hydrogen bond with D38. A V sidechain at position
501 makes a non polar contact with K353. Some of these interactions could be used in pharmacophore models and assist in the
identification of peptidomimetic compounds and organic molecules with the potential to inhibit the binding of the viral S1
protein to hACE2.
