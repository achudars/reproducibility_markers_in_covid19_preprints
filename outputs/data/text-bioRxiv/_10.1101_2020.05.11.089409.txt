ABSTRACT
Background:

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has a major global health and

socio-economic burden. It has instigated the mobilisation of resources into the development of control

tools, such as diagnostics and vaccines. The poor performance of some diagnostic serological tools has

emphasised the need for up to date immune-informatic analyses to inform the selection of viable

targets for further study. This requires the integration and analysis of genetic and immunological data

for SARS-CoV-2 and its homology with other human coronavirus species to understand cross-reactivity.

Methods:

We have developed an online “immuno-analytics” resource to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 research,

combining an extensive B/T-cell epitope mapping and prediction meta-analysis, and human CoV

sequence homology mapping and protein database annotation, with an updated variant database and

geospatial tracking for >7,800 non-synonymous mutation positions derived from >150,000 whole

genome sequences. To demonstrate its utility, we present an integrated analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike

and nucleocapsid proteins, both being vaccine and serological diagnostic targets, including an analysis

of changes in relevant mutation frequencies over time.

Results:

Our analysis reveals that the nucleocapsid protein in its native form appears to be a sub-

optimal target for use in serological diagnostic platforms. The most frequent mutations were the spike

protein D614G and nsp12 L314P, which were common (>86%) across all the geographical regions. Some

mutations in the spike protein (e.g. A222V and L18F) have increased in frequency in Europe during the

latter half of 2020, detected using our automated algorithms. The tool also suggests that orf3a proteins

may be a suitable alternative target for diagnostic serologic assays in a post-vaccine surveillance setting.

Conclusions:

The immuno-analytics tool can be accessed online (http://genomics.lshtm.ac.uk/immuno)

and will serve as a useful resource for biological discovery and surveillance in the fight against SARS-

CoV-2. Further, the tool may be adapted to inform on biological targets in future outbreaks, including

potential emerging human coronaviruses that spill over from animal hosts.

Background
COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was first characterised in the city of Wuhan,

Hubei, and has now spread to 190 countries. With over 60 million confirmed cases worldwide and more

than 1.26 million deaths, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed a high burden on the world’s healthcare

infrastructure and economies, with projected final costs of 28 trillion or 31% of the global gross

domestic product [1,2]. The majority of infections are either asymptomatic or result in mild flu-like

disease, with severe cases of viral pneumonia affecting between 1.0% (

≥

20 years) and 18.4% (

≥

80

years) of diagnosed patients [3]. Its variable infection outcome, mode of transmission and incubation

period together have enhanced the ability of the pathogen to spread efficiently worldwide. As a result,

there has been an urgent push for the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines to aid

control efforts.

Current front-line diagnostic strategies apply a quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assay

on patient nasopharyngeal swabs, using primer/probe sets targeting the

nsp10, RdRp, nsp14, envelope

and nucleocapsid genes; tests endorsed by a number of agencies and health systems [4,5] Patients

hospitalised with severe respiratory disease who are RT-qPCR negative may be diagnosed

radiographically (chest x-ray or computerised tomography scan), but in resource-poor and high

infection rate settings these methods maybe unviable. Considering the inherent limitations in the

sample collection process and transient viral load, RNA detection-based diagnostics can vary in their

sensitivity. The demand for serological diagnostics is high, particularly because these tests are capable

of detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, a biomarker indicative of infection, present after the infection has

been cleared by the immune system. These tools are essential to address crucial questions like how

many people have been infected within a population, including those who may have been

asymptomatic, and how long immunity can last post infection.

Numerous lateral flow rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)

tests have been developed, including an approved IgM/IgG RDT which uses the nucleocapsid protein as

a target for the detection of seroconverted individuals [6]. Other assays use the spike protein as an

antigen, with some using the receptor binding domain (RBD) as a target, a region with a high level of

diversity between alphacoronavirus species [7]. Unlike RNA detection methods, these platforms can

identify convalescent patients, which further informs outbreak control efforts. Long-term control

strategies will involve vaccine roll-out. As of November 2020, there were more than 50 vaccines at

development phase 1 or greater, with at least 10 vaccines in phase 3 [8,9]. Vaccines at the forefront,

include those based on a non-replicating adenovirus vector base (ChAdOx-nCoV-19 and Ad5-nCov), an

LNP-encapsulated mRNA (BNT162 and mRNA-1273), protein subunit (NVX-CoV2373) or inactivated

virus (BBIBP-CorV and CoronaVac) [8,9].

The discovery, development and management of efficacious vaccines and sensitive and specific

serological diagnostics are both dependant on the availability of up-to-date information on viral

evolution and immune-informatic analyses. The identification of variable or conserved regions in the

proteome of SARS-CoV-2 can inform the rational selection of reverse-design targets in both vaccinology

and diagnostic fields, as well as indicate immunologically relevant regions of interest for further studies

to characterise SARS-CoV-2 immune responses. Whilst the availability of biological data for SARS-CoV-2

in the public domain has increased, insights are most likely to come from its integration informatically

in an open and accessible format. Here we present an online integrated immuno-analytic resource for

the visualisation and extraction of SARS-CoV-2 meta-analysis data [10]. This platform utilises an

automated pipeline for the formation of a whole genome sequence variant database for SARS-CoV-2

isolates worldwide (as of November 2020, n=150,090). We have integrated this dataset with a suite of

B-cell epitope prediction platform meta analyses, HLA-I and HLA-II peptide prediction, an ‘epitope

mapping’ analysis of available experimental

in vitro confirmed epitope data from The Immune Epitope

Database (IEDB) and a protein orthologue sequence analysis of six relevant coronavirus species (SARS,

MERS, OC43, HKU1, NL63 and 229E); with all data updated and annotated regularly with information

from the UniProt database. Furthermore, we have a feature that will enable users to visualise external

analytical datasets presented in the literature (e.g.

[11]). With this resource users can browse the SARS-

CoV-2 proteome annotated with the above analyses and extract meta data to inform further

experiments. To demonstrate the functionality of the immuno-analytics tool, we present an analysis of

the SARS-CoV-2 spike, nucleocapsid and orf3a proteins, which are vaccine and serological targets.

Methods
Whole genome sequence data analysis
SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences were downloaded from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and

GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org). As a part of an automated in-house pipeline, sequences were aligned

using MAFFT software (v7.2) [12] and trimmed to the beginning of the first reading frame (orf1ab-

nsp1). Sequences with >20% missing were excluded from the dataset. Using data available from the

NCBI COVID-19 resource, a modified annotation (GFF) file was generated and open reading frames

(ORFs) for each respective viral protein were extracted (taking in to account ribosomal slippage) using

bedtools ‘getfasta’ function [13]. Each ORF was translated using EMBOSS transeq software [14] and the

variants for each protein sequence were identified using an in-house script. As a part of our analysis

pipeline we generated consensus sequences for each SARS-CoV-2 protein from the nucleotide database

using the EMBOSS Cons CLI tool [14]. These canonical sequences were used as a reference for

prediction, specificity and epitope mapping analyses.

B-cell epitope prediction meta-analysis
Six epitope prediction software platforms were chosen for this analysis (Bepipred [15], AAPpred [16]

DRREP [17], ABCpred [18], LBtope [19] and BCEpreds [20]). For each tool, we used the settings and

quality cut-offs as recommended by their respective authors. The scores across the predictive platforms

were then normalised (minimum-maximum scaled) to ensure that no single tool skewed the aggregate

‘consensus’ score, and combined to provide a single consensus B-cell epitope prediction score. Within

the ‘raw data table’ (accessed from the tool’s landing page) users can dissect each score depending on

their preference of methodology.

HLA-I and HLA-II peptide prediction
We have incorporated an HLA-I peptide prediction analysis into the tool to aid in the scrutiny and

development of vaccine candidates. CD8

effector immunity has been reported to play a central role in

the response to SARS-CoV infection, as well as infection mediated immunopathology [21–23]. We used

a database of 2,915 HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C alleles to make HLA-I peptide binding predictions using the

netMHCpan server (v4.1) [24], with peptide lengths of 8 to 14 amino acids across the entire SARS-CoV-2

proteome. We chose to use the netMHCpan server for our HLA-I peptide prediction analysis, due to its

high overall performance and its extensive HLA-I allele database [24]. We ran predictions for a total of

2,915 alleles (HLA-A 886, HLA-B 1412 and HLA-C 617), across all peptide lengths (8-14 amino acids). The

analysis generated 1.1 billion candidates. After quality control we selected a total of 736,073 peptides

based on strong binding affinity across the allele database for further analysis. We selected strong

binding affinity peptides based on the tools internal binding scoring metrics. Only ‘strong binding’

alleles were selected for further analysis. For each position with a ligand with high binding affinity we

analysed the percentage representation of the respective HLA-I type across the allele database. For

predicting HLA-II peptides we used the MARIA online tool [25]. We pre-processed the SARS-CoV-2

canonical protein sequences using a 15 amino acid sliding window. Predictions were made for all

available HLA-II alleles.

A 95% cut off was chosen for a positive HLA-II presentation. All data for each

15-mer is displayed on the tool.

Epitope mapping
B-cell epitopes for coronavirus species were sourced from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB)

resource (https://www.iedb.org). Using BLASTp [26] we mapped short amino acid epitope sequences

onto the canonical sequence of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A BLASTp bitscore of 25 with a minimum length of

8 residues was selected as a quality cut-off for mapped epitopes. The frequency of mapped epitopes

was logged for each position in the protein and parsed for graphical representation.

Coronavirus homology analysis
Reference proteomes for SARS, MERS, OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63 α and β coronavirus (-CoV) species

were sourced from UniProt database. These sequences were processed into 10-mers using the

pyfasta

platform and mapped on to the canonical sequences of SARS-CoV-2 proteins using the aforementioned

‘epitope mapping’ process. The k-mer mapping technique applied used a matching threshold of at least

10 residues in orthologous viral proteins, which is of sufficient length to cover HLA-bound peptides

and/or whole or part of a B-cell epitope; something that is challenging using only pairwise multiple

sequence alignments. Homologous peptide sequences with a BLAST bitscore indicating 10 or more

residues mapped to the target sequence were recorded and parsed for display on the graph.

Online SARS-CoV-2 “Immuno-analytics” resource and analysis software
We developed an online immuno-analytics resource with an interactive plot that integrates SARS-CoV-2

genetic variation, epitope prediction and mapping, with other coronavirus homology, as well as a table

for candidate proteome analysis. This tool is available online (from

http://genomics.lshtm.ac.uk/immuno) (see

used to generate the interactive plot and

Datatables.net libraries for the table. The underlying browser

software and in-house pipelines for data analysis are available (https://github.com/dan-ward-

bio/COVID-immunoanalytics). To facilitate the further scrutiny of non-synonymous mutations in the

dataset, we have developed an interface as a part of the COVID immuno-analytics platform to enable

users to temporally and geographically track mutant sites within a given SARS-CoV-2 protein

Temporal and geographic data on individual mutations can be found on the ‘Mutation Tracker’ page,

accessed via the tools home page. For the temporal/geographic non-synonymous mutation plots, we

partitioned the whole genome sequencing dataset by week and continent and plotted non-synonymous

allele frequencies using the Google Charts JavaScript libraries. Metadata on collection data and

geographic location from each GISAID sequence was used to place each data point respectively. To

improve sustainability of the tool, all functions and data of the website are generated and updated

using automated data scripts developed in-house.

Results
Analysis of 150,090 SARS-CoV-2 sequences identified 911,324 non-synonymous mutations across

16,951 sites in protein coding regions; 0.71% of these mutations are singleton events and 0.03% (46) of

these mutations have a frequency above 1%, occurring in >1,500 samples. The most frequent mutations

were the spike protein D614G (87.3%) and nsp12 L314P (87.5%), which were common across all the

geographical regions (all >86%) (

Table 1

), in keeping with their deep ancestral nature in the SARS-CoV-2

phylogenetic tree [23]. In particular, nsp12 L314P has been used to genotype the putative S and L

strains of SARS-CoV-2, which have now been clustered into further groups [27]. Spike D614G lies 73

residues downstream from the spike RBD, a region of interest as it is a primary target of protective

humoral responses and bears immunodominant epitopes that play a possible role in antibody

dependant enhancement [28–31]. We have observed a strong correlation between the spatiotemporal

accumulation of both spike D614G and nsp12 L314P

(Figure 1, Table 1),

due to either a common origin

and subsequently linked accumulation by a founder effect, or a more complex biological interaction,

including positive selection driven imparted by increased transmissibility as suggested by a recent study

[32]. Specifically, the spike D614G and nsp12 N314L both appear to have a near-identical frequency

with a consistent increase across all geographic regions (negating weeks with poor data collection). In

contrast, the frequency of orf3a Q57H appears to fluctuate, increasing and decreasing significantly from

the time it was first observed in February 2020 (week 8) to present day (November 2020, week 43)

Figure 1; Table 1

(

). Using the immuno-analytical tool, spike A222V, S477N and L18F variants were

observed to have increased significantly in frequency between May and November 2020 (weeks 23-40).

Spike mutations A222V and L18F appear to become entrenched in Europe reaching a total frequency of

70.6% and 31.6.%, respectively (

S1 Table, S2 Figure)

. Moreover, A222V appears to be increasing in Asia

and Oceania from week 41, and S477N has increased to >95% frequency across Oceania (N=8,321) with

a peak of 9.3% in Europe (

S1 Table, S2 Figure

), consistent with a recent report [33].

The proximity of the D614G mutation to one of the functional domains of the spike protein has raised

concerns, but whether it confers any gain in pathogenicity, transmissibility or immune evasion is still

unclear [32]. Other high frequency mutations occur on the nucleocapsid gene (R203K, 38.8.0%; G204R

38.4%; across all geographical regions >31%;

Table 1

), which has been the target antigen for several

serological RDTs currently in use or in production. Both of these mutations share a near-identical

spaciotemporal profile. We have identified 363 non-synonymous variant sites across the nucleocapsid

gene with mutations occurring 173,955 times in this dataset. Using the SARS-CoV-2 immuno-analytics

platform we further queried these polymorphic regions for immunological relevance. The 20 residues

surrounding the spike mutation D614G (S604-624) (

Figure 2

) have a high epitope prediction meta-score

(34% increase on the global median) with 204 IEDB epitope positions mapping to the surrounding

residues, suggesting this region is of high interest and may elicit a strong immune response. On top of

the high level of SARS-CoV sequence homology reported, we have identified multiple clusters in the S2

domain of the spike protein, with homology to MERS, OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63 human

coronaviruses, which may elicit a cross-reactive immune response in immune sera. Human coronavirus

sequence homology is greatly reduced in the S1 domain, with only two small 10-residue pockets of

OC43 and HKU1 identity (see

Figure 2

). We observed a 17% increase over the median epitope meta-

score within the receptor-binding motif (AA437-508), a region implicated in the direct ACE2 interaction.

HLA-II peptide binding prediction (see

Figure 3

) yielded several epitopes within the receptor binding

domain with high HLA-II ligand affinity, as well as strong B-cell epitope prediction scores (28% above the

global median). Metadata obtained from the UniProt database reveals 3 clusters of glycosylated

residues across the spike protein, a characteristic highlighted by this tool that should be considered

when choosing expression systems for producing protein/peptides based on these regions.

For two high frequency non-synonymous nucleocapsid protein mutations (R203K and G204R; co-fixed),

all but three of the 30 (N173-234) flanking residues have non-synonymous variants, with 5 sites

reporting an alternative allele frequency greater than 1% (A220V, S194L, S197L, M234I and P199L:S).

The average epitope meta-score for these variant sites is 30% above the global median prediction

score, with the two aforementioned high frequency mutant residues scoring 35% above the global

median epitope predictive score.

The sequence homology analysis of the nucleocapsid protein

revealed a high level of shared identity between SARS-CoV (90%) and MERS-CoV (45%) on a per-residue

basis. The nucleocapsid protein analysis revealed two clusters of shared human coronavirus orthologue

identity (

), one of which was found to cross the aforementioned N173-234 region with identity

to HKU1, NL63, MERS and SARS detected. Moreover, these clusters were found to have an increased

IEDB epitope mapping frequency, high polymorphism frequency and B-cell epitope meta-scores (23%

above the global median) indicative of potential B-cell immunogenicity. We focused on two

nucleocapsid protein specific regions of interest (amino acids 102 to 137 and 167 to 206;

Figure 2).

Within the first 35-residue region (amino acids 102 to 137), we have detected NL63, SARS, OC43, 229E,

MERS and HKU1 human coronavirus homology. Further, we observed an increase in mapped IEDB

epitopes, including mapped linear peptidic B and T-cell epitopes from avian gammacoronavirus, murine

betacoronavirus, feline and canine alphacoronavirus-1 providing

in vitro confirmation that peptides

within this region may indeed serve as immunogenic cross-reactive epitopes. The second region (amino

acids 167 to 206) contains the R203K and G204R mutations along with a cluster of high frequency

variants. We detected homology with HKU1, NL63 and MERS human coronavirus species along with a

high frequency of SARS and murine coronavirus mapped IEDB epitopes, with a 34% increase on the

median B-vell epitope prediction meta-score.

Previous studies of adaptive cellular effector immune responses to SARS-CoV infection have

emphasised the importance of spike peptide presentation in the progression and severity of disease;

regions of particular interest include: S436–443, S525–532, S366–374, S978, S1202 [21,22,34]. We

analysed these regions for their performance as HLA-I ligands

in-silico and found that all of the regions

of interest had a high binding affinity scores associated with that position. Moreover, these peptides

were widely represented in the predictions made across the 2,915 HLA-A, -B and -C alleles used in this

analysis. Taking into account all available HLA-A, B and C alleles, we found the spike peptides had an

average allele coverage of 21%, 18% and 34% respectively. We performed an analysis to include 12

alleles with the highest frequency observed across the human population, as reported recently [11]. We

found that peptides in the S366-374 and S1202 regions had high representation across the subset of 12

Figure 3

high frequency HLA-I alleles (

). These findings imply that the peptides as HLA-I ligands may have

a putative role in initiating a protective cellular response in SARS-CoV-2 infections across a significant

proportion of the HLA-I population worldwide. We have identified another region of interest that

scores highly in the HLA-I peptide binding analysis. The S690-700 region has a high frequency of

peptides with a high binding affinity with significant representation across all HLA-I alleles (HLA-A 40%, -

B 23%, -C 60%). Furthermore, we have observed no mutations present in this region based on our SARS-

CoV-2 variant analysis, implying this peptide appears to remain conserved making it a prime candidate

for further study. The spike D614G mutation does not appear to have significantly elevated HLA-I

epitope prediction scores

(Figure 3)

, a finding supported by recent work [35]. The biological importance

of spike D614G, particularly its immunological relevance and impact on transmission and disease, are

still unclear [36,37].

Protein 3a (orf3a), has been reported to play a role in host immune modulation by decreasing

interferon alpha-receptor expression in SARS-CoV infected cells and activating the NLRP3

inflammasome [38,39]; a response that may boost inflammation mediated COVID-19 pathology. Orf3a

has been a target for SARS-CoV vaccinology studies, with reports of it eliciting potentially protective

responses in both protein and DNA forms [23,40]. These immunogenic properties appear conserved in

the SARS-CoV-2 orthologue, with consistently strong antibody responses reported in COVID-19 patients

[41]. Looking across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, of the 50 residues with the highest B-cell epitope

prediction meta-score, orf3a occupies 16%, despite only constituting 2.5% of the total SARS-CoV-2

protein sequence. Moreover, there are numerous high affinity HLA-II epitopes, which may serve to elicit

strong antibody responses. Although protein orf3a shares a high level of identity with its SARS-CoV

orthologue, we detected no amino acid sequence homology with OC43, NL63, HKU1 and 229E human

coronavirus species or any non-SARS-CoV IEDB epitopes.

Our analysis of the 150,090 SAR-CoV-2 whole genome sequences detected 267 variant sites within

orf3a, with non-synonymous mutations occurring 68,473 times. A minority of these variant sites are

singletons (8.2%) and five (1.8%) have a frequency higher than 1% (>1500 isolates), with a non-

synonymous mutation density 40% lower than that of the nucleocapsid. The variant sites identified in

the orf3a gene have a mean epitope predictive meta-score of 2.3, which is equal to the median global

score, indicating that these sites may not form a part of a B-cell epitope. Comparing the predictive

meta-scores of the nucleocapsid protein variant sites, we observed an increase of 26% over the global

median, indicating that nucleocapsid protein non-synonymous mutations may impact epitope

variability more than those found in orf3a. CD8

+

effector responses to protein 3a have been

characterised in SARS-CoV patients and appear to play a significant role in immunity [22,42,43].

Notably, alongside two within the spike protein, a peptide in orf3a (orf3a 36-50) has been found to

form a part of the public (conserved) T-cell epitope repertoire across SARS-CoV patients [43]. This

region scores highly in the HLA-II predictions with numerous HLA-A and HLA-B high affinity peptides

covered (HLA-A 19%, -B 41%, -C 48%) and is relatively conserved with few low frequency non-

synonymous mutations (maximum mutant allele frequency of 0.00219 (65 times)). We have identified

one further region in orf3a (101-121) that scores highly with HLA-I epitope prediction across frequent

HLA-I alleles (

), and therefore may be of interest to those studying HLA-I ligands. For HLA-I

prediction, we observed that orf3a performs significantly better than the nucleocapsid. Despite the

nucleocapsid protein sequence being 52% larger than that of orf3a, there are 34% more high affinity

HLA-I epitopes across our subset of 12 frequent HLA-I alleles (

Figure 3)

, which may indicate that orf3a

has a more immunodominant role in cellular responses following intracellular processing when

compared to the nucleocapsid protein.

Discussion
We have developed an immuno-analytical tool that combines

in silico prediction data with in vitro

epitope mapping, SARS-CoV-2 genome variation and a k-mer-based human coronavirus sequence

homology with curated functional annotation data. Furthermore, we have added functionality enabling

users to track mutations geographically across time. An additional framework exists to annotate

positions with relevant findings from the literature to further guide users’ research. The integration and

co-visualisation of these data support the rational selection of diagnostics, vaccine targets with reverse-

immunology, and highlight regions for further immunological studies. Using the tool, we demonstrate

our analysis on three proteins and their mutant positions that are of relevance to current SARS-CoV-2

research, highlighting important features that will inform further SARS-CoV-2 research.

Understanding the magnitude of transmission and patterns of infection will lead to insights for post-

isolation strategies. The rapid emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus called for an expediated process to

deploy serological RDTs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibody responses. There were

reports early in the outbreak of lateral flow SARS-CoV-2 Ig RDTs not reaching sufficiently high levels of

sensitivity and specificity [43]. While many assays use the spike protein as its sole antigen for antibody

detection, others employ a combination of the spike and nucleocapsid proteins; other assays have been

based solely on the nucleocapsid protein [6]. Our analyses suggest that, in its native form, the

nucleocapsid protein may prove a sub-optimal target for use in serological diagnostic platforms. It

possesses the greatest number of residues across all SARS-CoV-2 genes with high-frequency non-

synonymous mutations, the majority of which have a high predictive epitope and IEDB epitope mapping

scores when compared to variant positions of other genes. This implies that there may be an inherent

variability in dominant antibody responses to different nucleocapsid protein isoforms, which may work

to confound testing. We have located three regions of homology with other highly prevalent human

coronavirus species, which could serve as non-specific SARS-CoV-2 epitopes if used in serological

assays. Moreover, we have emphasised the high level of SARS-CoV identity across the SARS-CoV-2

proteome (except in orf8 and orf10), which may have implications for diagnostic deployment in

countries that have had outbreaks involving SARS-CoV.

The spike protein has remained a focus of both vaccine and diagnostic research. Its functional role in

viral entry imparts this antigen with immunodominant and neutralising antibody responses [28,44]. This

role is reinforced in our analyses, with several clusters of high epitope meta-scores in functional

regions, and IEDB epitope mapping counts. The S1 domain in particular has been the focus of a number

of studies looking for specific antigens, not least because of its apparent lack of sequence homology

with other human coronavirus species when compared to regions in the S2 domain, but also its strong

functional and immunogenic role in SARS-CoV-2 infection [7,40,44,45]. However, as vaccination

programmes begin, most of which will target the spike protein, it will become challenging to

differentiate vaccination responses from those elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection. There may then be a

requirement for alternative viable targets for serological screening.

The broad nature of the analyses chosen for our tool may assist in the understanding of vaccine targets

both during design and testing phases. The prediction of HLA-I ligands is relevant not only to the study

of structural viral targets, but the full range of potentially immunologically relevant endogenous

proteins analysed here that may be presented following intracellular processing, some of which may

have less coverage in the literature. Our broad approach to HLA-I ligand prediction ensures that

researchers understand the applicability of

in-silico informed vaccine targets across different

populations; a vital factor in pandemic situations. Further, ensuring that targets are both specific and

devoid of polymorphism is essential to ensuring the longevity of vaccine responses and diagnostic

capabilities, the analysis of which is achieved easily with our tool. The humoral and cellular immune

responses, as well as the effects of H-CoV protein homology to SARS-CoV-2 proteins have yet to be fully

characterised. With the significant levels of amino-acid sequence identity between SARS-CoV-2 and

other H-CoV species detected in our analysis, researchers should be wary of the potentially deleterious

effects of both non-specific humoral and cellular responses in enhancing infection, a phenomenon

observed in a number of other viral pathology models. While the tracing and monitoring of non-

synonymous mutations and their spatiotemporal analysis provides an initial indication of their

importance, potentially the impact of evolutionary pressures on loci of interest, further analyses on

signals of selection may provide additional insights. Computer intensive genome-wide analyses of

positive selection are becoming available (e g. http://covid19.datamonkey.org/) and may be used to

complement insights from our immuno-analytical tool.

Using the SARS-CoV-2 immuno-analytics platform we were able to identify shortcomings in current

targets for diagnostics and suggest orf3a as another target for further study. This protein has proven

in

vitro immunogenicity in COVID-19 patients, as well as an array of supportive results from analyses
performed here. The database underpinning the online tool is updated automatically using data parsing

scripts that require minimal human curation. The monitoring of the temporal changes in the

frequencies of mutations or their presence in multiple clades in a SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree could

provide insights for infection control, including post-vaccine introduction. Importantly, our open-access

platform and tool enables the acquisition of all of the aforementioned data associated with the SARS-

CoV-2 proteome, assisting further important research on COVID-19 control tools.

Figure 3. Mapping of HLA-I A and B epitopes to the spike, nucleocapsid and orf3a protein
sequences. Epitopes were inferred using NetMHCpan 4.1. Only strong binding epitopes were
selected for analysis, based on the tool’s internal classification system. A representative set of HLA-I
alleles were used as described in Grifoni

et. al (2020) [11]. Binding affinity is based on predicted IC50

values (nM) (a lower concentration equates to a stronger affinity). Shaded region (denoted by A)
indicates the spike receptor binding domain (RBD).
