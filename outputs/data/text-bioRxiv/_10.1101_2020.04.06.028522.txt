ABSTRACT
Single-cell RNA profiling of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, had proposed multiple tissue cells as the potential
targets of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus causing the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most were not
echoed by the patients’ clinical manifestations, largely due to the lack of protein expression information of ACE2
and co-factors. Here, we incorporated the protein information to analyse the expression of ACE2, together with
TMPRSS2 and Furin, two proteases assisting SARS-CoV-2 infection, at single cell level in situ, which we called
protein-proofed single-cell RNA (pscRNA) profiling. Systemic analysis across 36 tissues revealed a rank list of
candidate cells potentially vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. The top targets are lung AT2 cells and macrophages,
then cardiomyocytes and adrenal gland stromal cells, followed by stromal cells in testis, ovary and thyroid.
Whereas, the polarized kidney proximal tubule cells, liver cholangiocytes and intestinal enterocytes are less
likely to be the primary SARS-CoV-2 targets as ACE2 localizes at the apical region of cells, where the viruses
may not readily reach. Actually, the stomach may constitute a physical barrier against SARS-CoV-2 as the
acidic environment in normal stomach (pH < 2.0) could completely inactivate SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-viruses.
These findings are in concert with the clinical characteristics of prominent lung symptoms, frequent heart injury,
and uncommon intestinal symptoms and acute kidney injury. Together, we provide a comprehensive view on
the potential SARS-CoV-2 targets by pscRNA profiling, and propose that, in addition to acute respiratory distress
syndrome, attentions should also be paid to the potential injuries in cardiovascular, endocrine and reproductive
systems during the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

In January, 2020, a novel coronavirus of unknown origin was identified to cause severe pneumonia in about
15-20% infected patients (Guan et al., 2020; Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response
Epidemiology, 2020), the disease is currently called COVID-19 abbreviated from Coronavirus Disease 2019
(Zhu et al., 2020a). The virus is phylogenetically similar (~76% amino acid identity) to the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Tang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b; Xu et al., 2020; Zhou et al.,
2020b; Zhu et al., 2020b), and was subsequently named as SARS-CoV-2 after the initial name of 2019-nCoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is much more contagious than SARS-CoV, and had infected more than 12 million of
individuals from 215 countries and territories as of July 12, 2020, leading to more than 56 thousands of deaths
with an average motility rate of about 4.5% (WHO, 2020). The pandemic of COVID-19 is posing a global health
emergency.

The coronavirus is a large group of enveloped, single-strand positive-sense RNA viruses, with SARS-CoV
and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) the two known deadly viruses for human (Li,
2016). The spike (S) envelope glycoproteins on coronavirus are the major determinants of host cell entry.
Proteolytic cleavage of S protein produces S1, the N-terminal region of S protein that is responsible for receptor
binding, and S2, the trans-membrane C-terminal region of S protein that promotes membrane fusion. The
cleavage step is often permissive for the fusion function of S protein as it helps to release the fusion peptide to
insert into the target cellular membrane (Li, 2016; Millet and Whittaker, 2015). Therefore, the host range and
cell/tissue tropism of coronaviruses were believed to be controlled by the S protein engagement of host cell
receptor, and by the proteolytic cleavage of the S protein as well (Millet and Whittaker, 2015). Recently, works
from several groups demonstrated, either bioinformatically or experimentally, that angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV virus (Li et al., 2003), is also a functional cellular receptor for
SARS-CoV-2 virus (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020; Zhou et al.,
2020b), and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and Furin are two proteases that process SARSCoV-2 S protein to establish efficient infection (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Meng et al., 2020; Walls
et al., 2020).

Single-cell RNA (scRNA) profiling is a state-of-the-art tool to dissect gene expression at single cell level,
therefore was employed to explore the target cells of the SARS-CoV-2. Based on the profiling of ACE2 mRNA
expression in different tissues/organs, multiple types of cells were proposed to be potentially targeted by SARSCoV-2 virus, including the lung alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells (Zhao et al., 2020a), nasal epithelial cells (WU et al.,
2020a), oesophageal epithelial cells and intestinal enterocytes (Zhang et al., 2020), liver cholangiocytes (Chai
et al., 2020), cardiomyocytes (Xin Zou), kidney proximal tubule cells (Lin et al., 2020), spermatogonia and
Leydig/sertoli cells in the testis (Zhengpin and Xiaojiang, 2020). However, unparallel to the many potential
targets cells and organs proposed, the COVID-19 patients primarily displayed typical symptoms of inflammation
in the lung, where only a very small portion of cells (~0.64% of total cells, and ~1.4% of AT2 cells) expressed
ACE2 mRNA (Zhao et al., 2020a); meanwhile, the injuries in other organs/tissues, such as the kidney and the
intestinal track, where ACE2 gene was expressed at high levels, seemed to be uncommon (Guan et al., 2020;
Wang et al., 2020a). This obvious discrepancy suggests that mechanisms other than ACE2 mRNA levels are
also involved in the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection of their target cells.

Considering that mRNA level does not always dictate comparable protein expression and subcellular
localizations, which are missing information from mRNA profiling, are critical for protein functions, we set out to
explore ACE2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels by taking advantages of the curated public database.
We called this method as protein-proofed scRNA (pscRNA) profiling. Moreover, we also analysed the coexpression of ACE2 with its two processing proteases, TMPRSS2 and Furin, at single cell resolution in situ by
pscRNA profiling. Systemic analysis of 36 human tissues/organs revealed that 1) a rank list of potential SARSCoV-2 targets with lung AT2 cell and macrophages as the top targets, then cardiomyocytes, and stromal cells

in testis, ovary, adrenal and thyroid glands. Among them, the lung macrophages, stromal cells in ovary and
adrenal gland, were identified for the first time, which may account for severe clinical symptoms and rapid
disease progression; 2) the mRNA levels may differ dramatically from the protein levels for ACE2, TMPRSS2
and Furin in different tissue cells; and protein subcellular localization is another factor potentially affecting virus
host-entry; 3) the co-expression of ACE2 with TMPRSS2 and Furin proteases may contribute to establish
efficient infection of SARS-CoV-2 virus.

To achieve a comprehensive analysis of tissue cells potentially vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 virus, we employed
a step-in strategy, ie, from tissue to cell, from multiple cells to single cell, from protein to mRNA, from single
gene expression to co-expression. During analysis, we primarily focused on the expression of ACE2 while taking
into account its co-expression with TMPRSS2 and Furin, two proteases that were believed to facilitate SARSCoV-2 infection. To evaluate the cell vulnerability, not only the mRNA levels but also the protein levels were
considered, and the protein levels actually take more weights as protein is the main function executor; also, not
only protein levels but also their subcellular localizations in a specified type of cell were considered, as the
subcellular localization determines the routes whereby viruses might access the protein receptor, for instance,
apical localized surface protein would primarily be accessed by viruses from the luminal side, but not viruses
from blood stream that are more likely infected unpolarized stromal cells. By following above principles, we
firstly examined tissue distribution of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin in both RNA and protein levels, then analyzed
their expressions in situ by immunohistochemistry, which could provide information on both protein levels and
subcellular localization. Subsequently, single cell RNA profiling was performed to determine and confirm cell
type and co-expression pattern. Finally, a rank list was proposed by integrating information from RNA and
protein levels, protein subcellular localizations, cell types and co-expression pattern, and the available
experimental evidences and clinical manifestations.

For scRNA profiling, the raw gene expression matrices for single cells were downloaded from Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and Human Cell Atlas Data Portal
(https://data.humancellatlas.org/). In total, we acquired the single cell gene expression datasets of various
normal tissues and organs, including the lung, heart, liver, kidney, intestine, stomach, testis, ovary, adrenal
gland and thyroid. Apart from the heart dataset, which was obtained by the smart-seq2 method, a majority of
the single cell data were generated through the 10x Chromium platform. The GEO accession number of these
datasets is GSE122960 (lung) (Reyfman et al., 2019), GSE109816 (heart) (Wang et al., 2020b), GSE131685
(kidney) (Liao et al., 2020), GSE125970 (intestine) (Wang et al., 2020c), GSE134520 (stomach) (Zhang et al.,
2019a), GSE109037 (testis) (Hermann et al., 2018), GSE134355 (thyroid and adrenal gland)(Han et al., 2020),
and GSE118127 (ovary) (Fan et al., 2019). The liver dataset was acquired from the Human Cell Atlas Data
Portal (MacParland et al., 2018). The summary of sample information for single-cell data was shown in the
supplementary table 1.

For tissue distribution of mRNA and protein expression profiles, data were obtained for target genes from

2015). The mRNA expression from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database was chosen for
demonstration with reference to the normalized consensus dataset (Carithers and Moore, 2015). The protein
expression scores were extracted directly from the “PROTEIN EXPRESSION SUMMARY” subcategory from
the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed on normal
human tissue samples (Thul et al., 2017). ACE2 expression was primarily detected with the rabbit antibody
(1:250, HPA000288, Sigma-Aldrich) and confirmed with the mouse antibody (1:5000, CAB026174, R&D

Systems); TMPRSS2 expression was detected with the rabbit antibody (1:300, HPA035787, Sigma-Aldrich);
Furin expression was detected with the rabbit antibody (1:125, sc-20801, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The
information on expression intensity and cell types expressing respective genes was extracted from the staining
reports for each staining in the HPA database.

The raw count matrices of single-cell transcriptome were imported into R (version 3.6.1, https://www.rproject.org/) and processed by the Seurat R package(version3.1.4) (Stuart et al., 2019). The filter criteria for
low-quality cells were determined on the basis of the number of genes and the percentage of mitochondrial
genes in the distinct tissue samples. Generally, cells with less than 200 detected genes, higher than 2500
detected genes and higher than 25% mitochondrial genome transcript ratio were removed. In specific, cells with
higher than 72% mitochondrial genome transcript ratio in the heart dataset and cells with higher than 50%
mitochondrial genome transcript ratio in the liver dataset were removed as mentioned by the corresponding
authors (MacParland et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020b). Then, the gene expression matrices were normalized
and scaled. Briefly, for each cell, the expression counts for each gene were divided by the sum of counts for all
genes of that cell, multiplied by a scaling factor (10,000) and log transformed using the “NormalizeData” function
in the R package Seurat. Furthermore, 2000 highly variable genes were selected based on a variance stabilizing
transformation method for downstream analysis.

To avoid batch effects among samples and experiments in the heart and intestine datasets, we adopted the
anchoring procedure in the Seurat R package to integrate the datasets as described previously (Stuart et al.,
2019). In brief, the “anchor” correspondences between datasets were identified using the
“FindIntegrationAnchors” function with default parameters in Seurat. Then, we used the “IntegrateData” function
in Seurat to obtain the batch-corrected expression matrices. We also applied another integration approach
called “Harmony” (Korsunsky et al., 2019) to the kidney and testis datasets. The Harmony R package
(version1.0, https://github.com/immunogenomics/Harmony) focuses on scalable integration of the scRNA-seq
data for batch correction.

In order to reduce the number of dimensions representing each cell, the “RunPCA” function in Seurat was
performed to calculate principal components (PCs). Then, the number of PCs used in downstream analysis and
visualization was determined based on the “JackStraw” procedure and the elbow of a scree plot. Nonlinear
dimensionality reduction algorithms, including uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and tdistributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE), were also used to conduct unsupervised clustering of
single cells. Specifically, we made use of the UMAP and t-SNE to place cells with similar local neighbourhoods
based on the statistically significant PCs to visualize the datasets.

Cell Clustering, Annotation and Visualization

We applied a graph-based clustering approach to assemble cells. Briefly, we constructed a K-nearest
neighbour graph based on the Euclidean distance in principal component analysis(PCA) space and refined the
edge weights between any two cells based on the shared overlap in their local neighbourhoods through the
“FindNeighbors” function in Seurat. Subsequently, we applied the Louvain algorithm using the “FindCluster”
function in Seurat to group cells.

We applied two strategies to determine cell types. First, canonical marker genes were applied to annotate
each cluster into known biological cell types. Expression dot plots or heatmaps of the marker genes for each
cluster are shown in Figure 3. Second, we used the “FindAllMarkers” function from R package Seurat to find
differentially expressed genes by comparing each cluster of cells with all other cells. Differentially expressed
genes in each cluster were enriched to the cell markers gene sets(Zhang et al., 2019b) using the “clusterProfiler”
R package (version 3.14.3) (Yu et al., 2012) to predict the probable cell types.

Umap plots, heatmaps, violin plots, and dot plots were generated using the R package Seurat. In order to

Based on the expression analysis across 36 human tissues, ACE2 displayed a tissue-specific expression at
both mRNA and protein levels. A total of 10 tissues expressed relatively higher level of ACE2 mRNA, including
the small intestine, colon, oesophagus, thyroid gland, kidney, testis, ovary, breast, heart muscle and adipose
tissue. Meanwhile, the majority of the other tissues, such as the lung, liver, pancreas, spleen, prostate, urinary
bladder, skin and neuronal tissues, had the marginal expression of ACE2 mRNA (Figure 1A-B, S1A). The
protein expression score, though also displaying a tissue-specific pattern, only indicated that 6 tissues
expressed ACE2 protein, with 5 of them matched the mRNA expression, including the small intestine, colon,
thyroid gland, kidney and testis. Interestingly, while the adrenal gland expressed little mRNA, it had a median
level of ACE2 protein expression. This inconsistency was true for ACE2 to other tissues such as the breast,

The expression of TMPRSS2 also had a tissue-specific pattern, but it was different from that of ACE2 in
terms of tissue distribution (Figure 1A, 1C, S1B and S1E). There were 5 tissues co-expressing relatively high
mRNA levels of TMPRSS2 and ACE2, include the small intestine, colon, thyroid gland, kidney and breast. At
the protein level, only the small intestine and kidney showed co-expression. Interestingly, the prostate
expressed the highest level of TMPRSS2 mRNA but had an undetectable level of ACE2 protein. These results
suggest that TMPRSS2 and ACE2 are not often co-expressed in the same tissues. Notably, considerable
TMPRSS2 mRNA was expressed in the lung, the target tissue of SARS-CoV-2 virus, which was consistent with
a promoting role of TMPRSS2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

As compared with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the expression of Furin protease was much less specific at both
the mRNA and protein levels, though some tissues, such as the liver and lung, did express much higher than
the others. Regarding the 5 tissues co-expressing TMPRSS2 and ACE2, the thyroid gland and kidney appeared
to simultaneously express high levels of Furin mRNA or protein (Figure 1A, 1D, S1C and S1F).

Tissues generally comprise multiple types of cells; therefore, the expression level of a specified gene at the
tissue scale may not be representative of its level at a certain type of cell. To address this issue, we first analysed
the protein expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin in situ from immunohistochemistry (IHC) images. Tissues
highly expressing ACE2 either at the mRNA level or protein level were included for analysis. In addition, the
putative SARS-CoV-2 target tissues proposed by previous studies, irrespective of ACE2 expression level, were
also included. This resulted in a list of 15 tissues in total (Figure 2, S2 and S3), which, based on the IHC intensity
of ACE2, could be roughly categorised into 3 groups. The ACE2-high group contained the kidney, stomach,
small intestine, colon, gallbladder and testis. In this group of tissues, ACE2 was generally expressed at the
apical region, facing the luminal surface of epithelial cells (Figure 2D-E, S2D-F, and S3B-D), which means that
efficient host entry of virus could only take place from the luminal side. This rule may not be applied to testis as
high level of ACE2 expression was also detected in the stromal cells (Figure 2F and S2F), which are not
polarized and could be potentially accessed by virus from the blood stream. The ACE2-low group contained
liver, oesophagus, breast and adipose tissue, which are unlikely to be the direct targets of SARS-CoV-2 virus
even though some of them showed high levels of mRNA expression, such as breast (Figure S3E) and adipose
tissues (Figure S3F). There was a small amount of ACE2-positive cells in the interlobular region of liver tissue
(Figure 2C and S2C), probably the cholanggiocytes as suggested below in scRNA analysis (Figure 4C). These
cells might be potential SARS-CoV-2 targets under the condition that viruses come from the luminal side, which
is normally rare, as the ACE2 protein was detected at the cell apical surface. The ACE2-median group contained
the lung, heart, ovary, adrenal gland and thyroid gland. For lung, the major target of SARS-CoV-2 virus, there
were considerable amounts of ACE2-positive cells in the alveolus lumen, which morphologically resembled
macrophages and represented for the majority of ACE2-positive cells in the lung tissue (Figure 2A and S2A).
All of the cardiomyocytes, and a portion of stromal cells in the ovary, adrenal gland and thyroid gland significantly
expressed ACE2 (Figure 2B, 2G-H, S3G), therefore were potential virus targets in the presence of viremia.

The expression of TMPRSS2 and Furin generally was also high in ACE2-high group tissues (Figure 2D-E,
S2B-D), with the exception of the testis, where TMPRSS2 seemed to be only highly enriched in the spermatids
(Figure 2F). For the ACE2-low group, TMPRSS2 and Furin were also expressed at low levels (Figure S3A, S3EF) with the exception of the liver, where the hepatocytes expressed Furin at quite high level (Figure 2C). For the
ACE2-median group, while Furin was readily detected in all the tissue cells, TMPRSS2 expression could be
readily detected in lung macrophages (Figure 2A and S2A), cardiomyocytes (Figure 2B and S2B) and adrenal
gland cells (Figure 2H and S2H), but not the stromal cells of ovary and thyroid gland (Figure 2G, S2G and S3G),
suggesting different probabilities for them to establish efficient infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus during viremia.

Together, based on the above analysis, we propose that lung macrophages, in addition to the well-known
AT2 cells, may be another direct target of SARS-CoV-2 virus. In the presence of viremia, the top vulnerable
targets might be the heart and adrenal gland, and then the less likely the testis, ovary and thyroid gland. Other
tissues are either unlikely direct targets or incompetent for establishing efficient infection due to lack of access
to virus or low expression of helping proteases.

To obtain comprehensive analysis of the target cells of SARS-CoV-2, we utilized the curated public
databases to perform scRNA profiling of the ACE2-high and -medium tissues, including the lung, heart, kidney,
intestinal track (ileum, rectum, colon), stomach, testis, ovary, thyroid and adrenal gland. In addition, we also
included the liver, the ACE2-low organ, in scRNA analysis given its important clinical implications. After quality
filtering (see Material and methods), We obtained a total of 147,726 cells and annotated 79 cell types involving
the respiratory, circulatory, digestive, urinary, reproductive and endocrine systems.

The lung, as the pivotal respiratory organ, is one of the target organs of SARS-CoV-2. In the lung dataset,
28819 cells from three donors passed stringent quality control and represented 11 cell types. Specifically, we
identified alveolar type II (AT2) cells, alveolar type I (AT1) cells, ciliated and club cells, alveolar macrophages,
dendritic cells, monocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, T and NKT cells, plasma and B cells. Expression of
canonical cell markers for pulmonary cell types was observed in largely non-overlapping cells, including SFTPC
for AT2 cells, AGER for AT1 cells, TPPP3 for ciliated cells, SCGB3A2 for club cells, CD68 for macrophages,
VWF for endothelial cells, CD3D for T and NKT cells, IGHG4 for plasma and B cells (Figure 3A). In the heart
dataset, we obtained 8148 high-quality cells consisting of 5 prime cell types, including cardiomyocytes,
endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells (SMC) and macrophages on the basis of their respective
molecular features (Figure 3B).

As such, the cell population of hepatic tissues from 5 human livers was classified into ten cell types based
on the expression of known markers, which was shown in Figure 3C. In addition, 23,366 kidney cells from 3
donors were identified and grouped into 10 cell types. The detailed cell categories of kidney and the expression
of specific cell markers were shown in Figure 3D.

For integrative analysis of the human intestinal mucosa at single cell level, we pooled 14,207 intestinal cells
together (6167 cells from two ileum samples, 4411 cells from two colon samples and 3629 cells from two rectum
samples). In total, these cells were partitioned into 7 main cell types, containing enteroendocrine cells (EC),
enterocytes, goblet cells, paneth cells (PC), paneth-like cells (PLC), stem cells and transient amplifying cells
(TAC) (Figure 3E). Additionally, we also investigated the gastric mucosa dataset incorporating 5281 cells and
finally annotated 9 cell types (Figure S4A-B).

To characterize the single-cell profiling of human reproductive organs, the testis and ovarian datasets were
thoroughly analysed. In the testis datasets from adult human sorted spermatogonia, spermatocytes and
spermatids, we identified 12,829 cells, which were classified into 5 major cell populations for downstream
analysis (Figure 3F). Similarly, we exploited 27,857 cells from 5 adult women ovaries, and defined 5 major cell
types, including theca cells, granulosa cells, endothelial cells, SMC and immune cells (Figure 3G).

The adrenal gland and thyroid, as the significant parts of the endocrine system, were also included into our
research. We took advantage of 9809 cells from the foetal adrenal gland and 8966 cells from the thyroid to
construct the single cell atlas (Figure 3H, Figure S4H). Based on the expression of specific cell markers, we
found that the atlas of the fetal adrenal gland mainly comprised epithelial cells, adrenocortical cell (AC),
hepatocyte-like cell (HLC), and chromaffin cells, while the atlas of the thyroid mainly consisted of thyroid
follicular cells, endothelial cells and SMC (Figure 3H, Figure S4I).

To determine the mRNA expression level of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin genes in distinct tissue cells, we
systematically explored the established cell atlases of different organs and tissues. We found the expression
level of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin genes varied significantly across the tissues and organs analyzed (Figure
4). Importantly, in certain tissues, these genes were only expressed in particular cell types. For example, the
SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 was mainly expressed in AT2 cells in the lung (Figure 4A), and cholangiocytes
and hepatocytes in the human liver (Figure 4C), which was consistent with results of previous studies (Chai et
al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020b) and confirmed our above analysis on the protein expression of ACE2. We further
investigated the mRNA expression of TMPRSS2 and Furin proteases and confirmed that these genes were
also expressed in the liver cholangiocytes and AT2 cells at the high level (Figure 4A and C). Notably, in the
adult ovary, we found that only stroma cells expressed the ACE2 and Furin genes (Figure 3G). In addition, the
spermatogonia moderately expressed the ACE2 gene as well as Furin and TMPRSS2 (Figure 4F), while the
Sertoli/Leydig cells expressed relatively low level of TMPRSS2, which was consistent with IHC results indicated
above.

Moreover, we observed that the expression of the ACE2 gene in the intestine and kidney was quite high
(Figure 4D, E). Interestingly, the expression levels of the TMPRSS2 and Furin genes in the kidney were not
remarkable (Figure 4D), which is inconsistent with the IHC results (Figure 2D). In addition, the high expression
of the ACE2 and Furin genes were found in cardiomyocytes (Figure 4B), which fits well with the IHC results
(Figure 2B). Moreover, the significant expression of the ACE2 gene was also shown in the cells of the fetal
adrenal gland, specifically in HLC and epithelial cells, as well as the significant expression of the TMPRSS2
and Furin genes (Figure 4H). By contrast, in the thyroid, there was little expression of the ACE2 despite the high
expression of TMPRSS2 and Furin (Figure S4J-K), which disagreed with the IHC results that ACE2 was highly
expressed in stromal cells of thyroid gland (Figure S3G). These results show that the heart and fetal adrenal
gland are more likely vulnerable to the SARS-CoV-2 virus via cardiomyocytes and HLC cells, respectively.

24

26

Taken together, we comprehensively analyzed the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin genes in
different tissue cells by feat of the scRNA-seq profiling and laid the foundation for identifying the target cells of
SARS-CoV-2.

Characterization of the co-expression features of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin

Considering the fact that cell receptors like ACE2, together with the proteases such as TMPRSS2 and Furin,
are required for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to efficiently infect cells, it is imperative to characterize the co-expression
patterns between ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin. Accordingly, we resorted to single-cell transcriptomes to profile
their co-expression patterns in the cell types indicated.

The results showed that the co-expression feature of these three genes were quite dominant in the intestine,
specifically in enterocytes (Figure 5E), and the proportion of ACE2 positive cells expressing either or both
TMPRSS2 and Furin in the intestine is higher than the other ACE2-high tissues such as the kidney (Figure 5D),
testis (Figure 5F) and stomach (Figure S4E-G). In detail, as shown in Figure 5D, though the cells in the kidney
expressed ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin at moderate to high levels, there was only a small proportion of ACE2
positive cells expressing either or both TMPRSS2 and Furin. The ACE2-low liver tissue displayed an interesting
expression pattern, showing that the co-expression feature of ACE2 with Furin and TMPRSS2 in the
hepatocytes and cholangiocytes was remarkable (Figure 5C), but the basal expression level with ACE2 in both
RNA and protein level was much lower (Figure 1B and 4C), arguing against the liver as a primary SARS-CoV2 target.

In the ACE2-medium tissues, we found that the lung displayed the co-expression features, especially in AT2
cells, and a highest percentage of ACE2 positive cells expressing either or both TMPRSS2 and Furin in the
investigated organs and tissues (Figure 5A), which provided the evidence that SARS-CoV-2 posed the serious
threat to the lung. Moreover, we observed a significant co-expression of the ACE2 gene with TMPRSS2 and

Furin in the epithelial cells and HLC of the fetal adrenal gland (Figure 5H), manifesting that the fetal adrenal
gland may be a target of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermoreconsistent with the results above, a portion of
cardiomyocytes simultaneously expressed ACE2 and Furin (Figure 5B). However, few cells co-expressed ACE2,
TMPRSS2 and Furin simultaneously in the ovary (Figure 5G) and thyroid gland (Figure S4M-N).

Since the normal stomach is highly acidic, it may conceivably serve as a physical barrier against SARS-Co-V2 virus. In order to test this idea, we made viruses pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The same
amounts of pseudo-viruses were pretreated under acidic conditions with pH of 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, or 7.0,
respectively, and then used to infect 293T-ACE2 cells and Hela-ACE2 cells. As shown in Figure 6, the viruses
were completely inactivated and incapable of infecting both types of cells anymore under the pH of 1.0 and
2.0, a condition resembling the normal acidity of fasting stomach (Weiss and Clark, 1985). Even under the pH
of 4.0, the viral infectivity was significantly compromised to 23% – 52% of normal level. Thus, the SARS-CoV2 virus was likely acid-instable, which is consistent with clinically uncommon symptom in gastrointestinal tract.

Previous analysis based solely on the mRNA expression of ACE2 suggested that multiple tissue cells may
be potential targets of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, including cells from almost every important human
system. However, the COVID-19 patients primarily display symptoms in the respiratory system, where ACE2 is
expressed in only a small portion of cells. Even for severely ill patients, the injuries or symptoms in the ACE2high organs such as the kidney and intestinal tract are relatively uncommon, with a rate of 1%-4.3% for acute
kidney injury (Guan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a), and a rate of 3.5%-5.8% for intestinal symptoms (Guan
et al., 2020; Special Expert Group for Control of the Epidemic of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia of the Chinese
Preventive Medicine, 2020). Instead, the injuries in ACE2-median organs such as the heart are more
common(12%-19%) (Guan et al., 2020; Special Expert Group for Control of the Epidemic of Novel Coronavirus
Pneumonia of the Chinese Preventive Medicine, 2020). This obvious discrepancy suggests that mechanisms
other than ACE2 expression level also play important roles in establishing efficient and successful infection.
Based on our analysis by pscRNA expression profiling, we propose that three more factors, in addition to the
mRNA level, should be taken into account for predicting the vulnerability of a specified target tissue/organ to
SARS-CoV2 infection.

First, the information on the protein expression level and protein subcellular localization may influence virus
infection. As shown above, the mRNA level did not often correspond to protein level, for example, the ACE2
expression in lung macrophages (Figure 2A and 4A). While ACE2 is readily detected in macrophages in IHC
staining (Figure 2A), there are only several macrophages positive in ACE2 (Figure 4A). This obvious
discrepancy may be resulted from limited scRNA samples analysed, which may not be the case as additional
lung scRNA analysis gave results similar to that in Figure 4A (data not shown); or protein-mRNA expression
inconsistency might be accountable, which actually necessitates the protein-proofed scRNA profiling analysis
that incorporates information from protein expression, RNA expression and biological experimentations as well.
In light of this point, the final rank list of SARS-CoV-2 vulnerable cells would be a result of combined
consideration. Actually, several recent works (Bost et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020c) indicated that macrophages
are indeed one major target cell of SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with our analysis. Therefore, it is necessary
to not only analyse mRNA expression, but also detect protein expression in situ. Moreover, membrane proteins
such as ACE2 could be expressed either all around the surface of non-polarized stromal cells such as Leydig
cells in the testis (Figure 2F and 3F), or specifically on the apical region of polarized epithelial cells such as the
enterocytes in the intestinal tract (Figure 2E). This means much for virus infection as it determines how the
viruses may get access to their target cells and enter. For the polarized cells like enterocytes, virus could only
successfully make infection from the luminal side, where ACE2 is expressed on the apical surface but not the

basal-lateral surfaces. Whereas, it was reported that coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV, lost infectivity in highly
acidic gastric fluid (Zhou et al., 2017), thus, the likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 get access to enterocytes via
stomach would be low. While for the non-polarized stromal cells, virus may readily come to see them from the
blood stream.

Second, the co-expression of infection co-factors determines the efficiency of successful infection. As for
SARS-CoV-2, TMPRSS2 and Furin were demonstrated to be important proteases that cleave the S protein to
promote host entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Meng et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020). Therefore, their co-expression
with ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, may dictate the vulnerability of the target tissues. Actually,
we found that some ACE2-high cells, such as stromal cells in the testis and ovary, expressed TMPRSS2 at
quite low levels (Figure 2F-G), suggesting that they may not be SARS-CoV-2 targets as susceptible as those
co-expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2/Furin proteases, such as cardiomyocytes in the heart, though
cardiomyocytes expressed relatively lower level of ACE2. It is conceivable that cells highly co-expressing ACE2,
TMPRSS2 and Furin proteases, such as lung macrophages and stromal cells in adrenal gland, would be readily
vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 attack in the presence of viruses.

Third, the feasible routes whereby viruses gain access to their target cells are also accountable for clinical
manifestations. In theory, there are two major routes for virus transmission: 1) direct entry to the luminal tracks
via open entries of the body. The potentially affected tissues/organs include those from the respiratory system,
digestive system and urinary tract, among which the respiratory system is much easier than the rest two to be
infected, as it is almost a completely open system, while the rest two are gated by multiple means. For example,
the stomach, which is a highly acidic, may serve as an effective barrier for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the intestinal
track by inactivating them (Figure 6). This may explain the prominent symptoms in the respiratory system but
not in the digestive and urinary systems despite high levels of co-expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin in
epithelial cells lining along the tracts of the later two systems; 2) transmission via the blood stream to the entire
body. This may theoretically affect all the internal organs with stromal cells expressing ACE2, with exception for
those polarized cells in which the ACE2 protein is only expressed on the apical surface unreachable by the
viruses from viremia. The target tissue cells affected by this route may include cardiomyocytes, stromal cells in
adrenal gland, Leydig cells in the testis, and stromal cells in the ovary and thyroid gland. Among them, only the
former two, but not the later three, are more likely the true or susceptible targets of SARS-CoV-2 when
considering the co-expression of helping proteases with ACE2. It should be noted that the precondition for this
route is viremia, which, however to our best knowledge, was not clearly documented in COVID-19 patients up
to date. Nevertheless, frequent heart injuries in COVID-19 patients (Guan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a) are
consistent with the presence of occasional viremia. Under such circumstances, the adrenal gland may be
another vulnerable target of SARS-CoV-2, which, to our best knowledge, is identified for the first time in this
study.

Intriguingly, a recent work by Ziegler et al (Ziegler et al., 2020) demonstrated that ACE2 is an interferonstimulated gene, and the immune response stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in upregulated
expression of cytokines such as interferon, which subsequently upregulates ACE2 expression in the
neighbouring cells promoting virus dissemination. Thus, in addition to the basal ACE2-TMPRSS2 co-expression
as analysed in this study, which mediates the initial viral infection, a positive-feedback loop between virus
infection and interferon signalling would facilitate viral dissemination by increasing ACE2 expression. This
finding was further confirmed by two independent studies by Smith J et al (Smith et al., 2020) and Wang et al
(Wang and Cheng, 2020). This factor should also be taken into account when analysing tissue injuries and
clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients.

In summary, we propose that the pscRNA profiling is a feasible way for gene expression analysis at both
protein and mRNA levels. Through a systemic analysis of 36 human tissues/organs by pscRNA profiling of
ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin proteases, we propose a rank list of tissue cells potentially vulnerable to SARS11

CoV-2 attack. For initial infection, ACE2-expressing cells, with the co-expression of TMPRSS2 and Furin as a
plus, in the respiratory track are the primary targets. These cells include the known lung AT2 cells, and
macrophages in this study, and also the nasal epithelial cells as reported recently (WU et al., 2020a). And the
likelihood of epithelial cells in digestive and urinary systems as the primary targets is low. During a period of
viremia, the top internal organ targets would be cardiomyocytes, and stromal cells in the adrenal gland, as both
of these express ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin proteases; the descent targets may be Leydig cells in the testis,
and stromal cells in the ovary and thyroid gland, as these cells are un-polarized and ACE2-positve, but do not
show ideal co-expression of TMPRSS2 or Furin proteases. Notably, the identification of the adrenal gland as a
SARS-CoV-2 target may be quite informative for clinical practise if experimentally confirmed, because the
COVID-19 disease frequently proceeds to a severe or very severe stage in a short period, which suggests
systemic conditions occur probably due to deregulated endocrine systems involving the adrenal gland. This
issue remains to be validated experimentally and clinically.
