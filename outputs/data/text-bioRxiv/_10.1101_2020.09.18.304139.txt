Summary:
RNA structural elements occur in numerous single stranded (+)-sense RNA viruses. The stemloop 2 motif (s2m) is one such element with an unusually high degree of sequence
conservation, being found in the 3ʹ UTR in the genomes of many astroviruses, some
picornaviruses and noroviruses, and a variety of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2. The evolutionary conservation and its occurrence in all viral subgenomic
transcripts implicates a key role of s2m in the viral infection cycle. Our findings indicate that
the element, while stably folded, can nonetheless be invaded and remodelled spontaneously by
antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that initiate pairing in exposed loops and trigger efficient
sequence-specific RNA cleavage in reporter assays. ASOs also act to inhibit replication in an
astrovirus replicon model system in a sequence-specific, dose-dependent manner and inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture. Our results thus permit us to suggest that the s2m
element is a site of vulnerability readily targeted by ASOs, which show promise as anti-viral
agents.

INTRODUCTION
SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious virus and the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic. Given the continued rise in cases worldwide, the significant mortality rate and the
challenges in predicting the severity of illness in infected individuals (Messner et al., 2020),
there is a pressing need for efficacious antiviral therapies (Koirala et al., 2020; Krammer, 2020;
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/ /novel-coronavirus-2019). Moreover, the potential
for further outbreaks of infections by emerging pathogenic coronaviruses (Menachery et al,
2015; Akula and McCubrey, 2020) places importance on improving fundamental
understanding of coronavirus biology, as well as exploring novel therapeutics to build
capability for a rapid response to the next zoonotic jump.
Like other positive-sense (+) single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses, replication of SARS-CoV-2 is
orchestrated by virus-encoded enzymes inside infected host cells. The 30 kb long SARS-CoV2 genomic RNA and the subgenomic mRNA transcripts all contain a common 5ʹ-leader
sequence and a common 3ʹ UTR, which harbour several conserved structural elements,
including the stem-loop 2 motif (s2m) (Fig. 1A and B) (Rangan et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020).
The s2m, originally identified in astroviruses (Jonassen et al., 1998), is a highly conserved
RNA sequence element, present within the 3ʹ UTR in the genomes of many astroviruses, some
picornaviruses and noroviruses, and a variety of coronaviruses, including members of the
subgenus Sarbecovirus, which includes SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses (Tengs et al.,
2013, Tengs et al., 2016), and Merbecovirus, which includes MERS (Frey et al, 2014), the
causative agents of three recent severe human pathogenic outbreaks. The SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 s2m sequences are nearly identical, with only 2 point nucleotide divergence
(Fig. 1A), in contrast to the overall 20 % genome-wide sequence difference (Kim et al., 2020).
The s2m sequence is also highly conserved in the clinical isolates from patients that have tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the current pandemic, although with a few isolated exceptions
(GSAID database https://www.gisaid.org; UCSC genome browser; Vahed et al.,2020; Yeh and
Contreras, 2020). The high degree of s2m sequence conservation is likely to be a direct
consequence of a requirement to sustain an elaborate and conserved three-dimensional
structure. Indeed, an earlier study of the SARS-CoV s2m element revealed a stable stem loop
with a few exposed bases (Fig. 1B) in a 2.7 Å resolution crystal structure (Robertson et al.,
2005). Several more recent studies probed RNA accessibility and mapped RNA-RNA
interactions of the (+) sense SARS-CoV-2 viral species inside the host cell, confirming that the
s2m stem-loop structure folds in vivo as well (Huston, 2020; Ziv et al., 2020).
Because of the apparent high degree of selective pressure to maintain this specific sequence
and its structure, the s2m is a promising target for potential antiviral agents, with reduced
likelihood of evolving mutations that would lead to resistance. Any agents targeting the s2m
element would also have the advantage of acting against a large number of virus RNA species,
due to the presence of the element in all (+)-sense virus RNAs, including both the full-length
genome and the subgenomic mRNAs. In order to test the accessibility of the s2m element to
potential nucleic acid-based therapeutics, we designed a panel of antisense oligonucleotides
(ASOs). These oligonucleotides have proven therapeutic potential against viruses and have
been undergoing active development for more than a decade (Bennett, 2019). Third-generation
ASOs include locked nucleic acids (LNAs), in which a bicyclic linkage at the furanose
constrains the conformational freedom of the nucleotide (Singh et al., 1998). LNAs provide
high affinity base-pairing to complementary RNA and DNA targets, as well as resistance to
nuclease attack (Hagedorn et al., 2018). A version of LNA ASOs known as ‘gapmers’ consists
of LNA bases flanking a central DNA sequence (Wahlenstedt et al, 2000). In this design, LNA

bases confer resistance to nucleases and provide high-affinity base-pairing to target RNA,
while the central DNA region, once base-paired to RNA, recruits ribonuclease H (RNase H),
which acts to cleave the RNA in the RNA-DNA duplex. In this process, the DNA is not
digested and thus the gapmer remains intact and free to bind further RNA molecules. Gapmers
have already been successfully used in clinical trials to silence target transcripts (Bonneau et
al., 2019).
In this report, we describe the design and testing of several LNA ASOs (gapmers) against the
highly conserved structured s2m element from the 3’ UTR of SARS-CoV-2. We found by
chemical probing of the RNA target element that despite the high degree of structural
compactness, ASOs were successfully disrupting the s2m structure. Furthermore, gapmers
were capable of inducing sequence-specific RNA cleavage in vitro and in multiple independent
cell-based platforms, including a human reporter system, an astrovirus replicon assay, and
direct inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected cells. Our results support targeting of
the s2m element and other conserved structures with predicted exposed loops in the viral
genomes by ASOs. In addition, the particular gapmer designs described here may offer suitable
lead compounds for further development as antiviral therapeutics to treat COVID-19 and other
diseases caused by RNA viruses possessing the s2m element in their genomes.
RESULTS
Model for the s2m element in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 3ʹ UTR
Given the high sequence similarity between the s2m elements in the SARS-CoV-2 and SARSCoV genomes (Fig. 1A), the corresponding structures are expected to show high similarity as
well. The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV s2m reveals a stem loop with a small pocket that
can accommodate cations (Fig. 1B; Robertson et al., 2005) and suggests a similar fold for the
SARS-CoV-2 s2m. To test this experimentally, we probed the structure of the SARS-CoV-2
s2m element within the genomic 3ʹ UTR using SHAPE (Selective 2′-Hydroxyl Acylation
analyzed by Primer Extension) (Spitale et al., 2013). The SHAPE reactivity profile strongly
agrees with the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV s2m element (Fig. 1C). For instance, high
SHAPE reactivities were found at the loop region (G71-A75), indicating strong possibility of
a single-stranded nature, while low SHAPE reactivities were found for nucleotides predicted
to be base-paired, such as nucleotides 54-58, and nucleotides 90-94. We performed further
SHAPE probing on an extended version of the 3’ UTR RNA (“extended 3ʹ UTR”) that
additionally includes ORF10 and the region immediately upstream from it (ORF10 may not be
protein coding; Taiaroa et al., 2020; Jungreis et al., 2020) (Fig. S1 and Table 1). We found a
high degree of consistency between the SHAPE profiles for the s2m element in the extended
and non-extended constructs (Pearson correlation coefficient PCC = 0.996, Fig. S1B and S1C),
indicating that the s2m element in the 3ʹ UTR is stably folded and is unlikely to be affected by
flanking regions such as ORF10. Stable structural unit formation by s2m, maintained within
an extended surrounding sequence, has also been observed in a recent NMR and DMS chemical
probing study (Wacker et al., 2020), with experimental data agreeing with the s2m secondary
structure proposed here (Fig. 1C). Further support for our findings comes from recent wholegenome studies of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA structure, which show good agreement between
SHAPE reactivity and in silico predictions and identify s2m stem loop in this context (Huston,
2020; Manfredonia et al, 2020).
To further investigate potential structures formed by the viral 3ʹ UTR as a whole, we used cryoelectron microscopy. Imaging this RNA fragment mainly yielded elongated shapes resembling

thick rope, up to 500 Å in length (Fig. 1D). A subset of the ropey particles were less extended,
measuring around 300 Å, which is about half the length expected for an elongated polymer,
implying that the RNA there is semi-compact. These particles were subjected to computational
2D/3D averaging in an attempt to reveal underlying shared structural features (Fig 1E and F).
However, none could be clearly identified, suggesting that the 3’ UTR RNA does not fold into
a well-defined structure, at least in vitro.
Our cryo-electron microscopy observations give support to earlier in vivo studies, where cells
infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus were probed by cryo-electron tomography (Klein et al.,
2020). Both the tomography study and our single-particle imaging reveal small, high-contrast
features at the periphery of the RNA particles, which might represent views down the long axis
of some duplex RNA regions (Fig. 1D, red arrows).
Overall, based on the prediction from the SARS-CoV s2m RNA crystal structure and our
SHAPE probing results, we conclude that the s2m element in the 3ʹ UTR of SARS-CoV-2
RNA folds into a stem-loop structure, which may be highly conserved among coronaviruses.
This is in contrast to the entire 3’ UTR as a whole, for which we do not observe any welldefined global structure.
Design of LNA ASO gapmers against the s2m element; assessment of binding and activity
in vitro
Although the highly conserved nature of the s2m element makes it an attractive target for
therapies based on ASOs, the structured nature of the target may potentially interfere with
ASO-target base-pairing. To facilitate gapmer-induced disruption of the native s2m structure,
we designed gapmers so that the high-affinity LNA bases would pair with the RNA bases
predicted to be exposed in the s2m element (Fig. 2 and Table 3). This pairing should facilitate
initial gapmer-target interaction, hypothetically leading to unfolding of the s2m element as the
rest of the gapmer base-pairs with the complementary target nucleotides.
We designed a panel of gapmers and tested their ability to direct RNase H cleavage in vitro,
using s2m RNA as the substrate for the purified enzyme (Fig. 2A and D). Gapmers 1-3 were
designed to have higher affinity for target RNA than gapmers 4-6, as indicated by respective
predicted melting temperatures (schematic top panel, Fig. 2 and Table 3). The presence of the
sequence-specific gapmers 1-6 in the digestion reactions led to clear degradation of target
RNA, regardless of their predicted melting temperature bracket, whereas non-sequencespecific control gapmer with scrambled sequence failed to have an effect (“scr”, Fig. 2D). The
degradation was very efficient even for 2:1 s2m:gapmer molar ratio, indicating that gapmers
can be recycled and can direct multiple turnover of substrates by RNase H. Gapmers 1-6 also
drove cleavage of the whole 3ʹ UTR (Fig. 2B and E) and of the “extended 3ʹ UTR” construct
that additionally includes ORF10 and the region immediately upstream of it (Fig. 2F),
indicating that the target s2m sequence is successfully recognised and is accessible for gapmer
base-pairing in its native sequence context. The observation that both the higher-affinity
gapmers 1-3 (Fig. 2A and B) and the lower-affinity gapmers 4-6 (Fig. 2 D, E and F) were able
to direct RNase H cleavage of the s2m element indicates that a range of gapmer-target affinities
are compatible with successful target degradation of the highly structured s2m sequence. This
flexibility in gapmer design is particularly important as higher affinity gapmers may be
expected to have more off-target interactions in cells, which may be reduced in lower-affinity
variants.

Additionally, we designed and tested gapmers targeting a single-stranded conserved region in
SARS-CoV-2, at position 1359-1374 relative to the NC_045512.2 virus reference genome
(“ss3”; Rangan et al., 2020) and tested alternative gapmer backbone chemistries with these.
Gapmers designated “all” and “some” have the same sequence and base composition, but
different polymer backbones (Table 3). The entire backbone of gapmer “all” contains
phosphorothioate modifications, as is also the case in gapmers 1-6; it is a well-established
modification conferring some nuclease resistance to oligonucleotides (Kumar et al., 1998;
Eckstein, 2000). The backbone in gapmer “some”, however, is mixed; DNA bases are linked
by phosphodiester backbone, whereas LNA bases are linked by phosphorothioate backbone.
In vitro digestion experiments (Fig. 2C) indicate that both chemistries are compatible with
RNase H recruitment and target RNA degradation and also suggest general applicability of
gapmer-induced degradation of viral RNA sequences. Gapmer “some” appears to have higher
binding affinity for the “ss3” target, judging from the presence of an extra band at the top of
the gel in Fig. 2C, which likely corresponds to a gapmer-target dimer. This is consistent with
expectation, as phosphorothioate modifications are known to reduce target affinity (Grünweller
et al., 2003), so gapmer “all” would be expected to show weaker binding than gapmer “some”.
On the other hand, gapmer “all” generates a higher amount of cleaved product (Fig. 2C), which
supports our choice of phosphorothioate backbone throughout gapmers 1-6.
s2m structure is successfully remodelled by LNA gapmers
To test whether gapmers have any effect on the s2m structure, we performed SHAPE probing
of SARS-CoV-2 3′ UTR in the presence of gapmers 1, 2 and 3 targeting s2m and gapmer “all”
as a non-specific control. Since SHAPE probing detects the accessibility of nucleotides (Spitale
et al., 2013), it is capable of revealing both intra- and inter-molecular RNA base-pairing
interactions.
In the presence of gapmer 1 and gapmer 2, SHAPE reactivity profiles strongly decreased in the
regions targeted by the gapmers, indicating inter-molecular interactions formed between
gapmers and their target sequences (Fig. 3A-D). In contrast, SHAPE reactivities strongly
increased in the regions that were originally base-paired with the gapmer-target regions and in
their flanking regions, indicating they were more single-stranded in the presence of gapmers,
consistent with expectation.
In the presence of gapmer 3, which targets the single-stranded loop region within s2m, SHAPE
reactivity profile showed a strong decrease in this region (Fig. 3E and F), indicating successful
targeting by gapmer. We also found that this inter-molecular interaction between gapmer 3 and
the loop region led to increased SHAPE reactivities downstream of the loop region. This
suggests that inter-molecular interactions between gapmers and target regions could also
remodel the folding status of flanking regions.
Notably, the observed changes in SHAPE reactivity were dependent on the concentration of
gapmers and were not detected in the presence of a control gapmer (gapmer “all”) which is not
able to target the s2m element (Fig. 3G and H). Taken together, our results validate the design
of gapmers in targeting the s2m element and highlight the effect of gapmers in remodelling
s2m structure.

To investigate if gapmers against the s2m element could drive target RNA silencing in human
cells, we set up a tissue culture-based reporter system. We generated lung-derived A549 and
HeLa cell reporter lines carrying stably integrated GFP genes that encode either the wild type
s2m element or a scrambled control sequence in the 3ʹ UTR (Fig. S2A and B). Transfection
with gapmers against s2m reduced GFP fluorescence levels in the two s2m-containing cell
lines for both the higher-affinity gapmers 1-3 and the lower-affinity gapmers 5-6 (Fig. 4A
and B). Gapmer 4, the shortest of the tested gapmers and containing only six DNA nucleotides
(Table 3), had no effect (Fig. 4A and B); this may reflect difficulties in recruiting human
RNase H in vivo to this length of RNA-DNA duplex (Kurreck et al., 2002). Non-specific
control gapmers did not affect GFP fluorescence levels, nor did treatment with s2m-specific
gapmers of control cell lines in which the sequence of the s2m element was scrambled
(Fig. S3A and B). These results indicate that the silencing effect relies on sequence-specific
gapmer-target interaction. Overall, the results show that gapmers against the s2m element have
the potential to silence gene expression from mRNAs containing s2m in their 3ʹ UTR
sequences, which is the case for SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs.
Our experimental method also functioned to test the hypothesis that the s2m is a posttranscriptional response element. We used the GFP reporter cell lines to compare fluorescence
levels between the GFP-s2m and GFP-scrambled cells. No difference was observed, indicating
that the s2m element itself does not affect fluorescent protein production (Fig. S2C) suggesting
that it does not act as an independent element in cis in translation of viral mRNAs.
LNA gapmers against s2m inhibit replication in an astrovirus replicon model system in
human cells
To investigate the effects of s2m-targeting LNA gapmers on viral replication, initially we
employed an astrovirus replicon system. Many (+) ssRNA viruses share a similar repertoire of
genetic elements required for the replication of viral RNA, and this is true in the case of
coronaviruses and astroviruses. Despite large differences in genome size, coronaviruses and
astroviruses possess a similar modular organization, including the order of non-structural and
structural genes, a frameshift signal to access the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)
open reading frame, and production of 3ʹ-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs for structural and
accessory protein expression. Like coronaviruses, many astroviruses – including human
astrovirus 1 (HAstV1) – contain an s2m element in the 3ʹ UTR of their genomes (Fig. 5A). We
have recently developed a robust HAstV1-based replicon system (Fig. 5A, lower panel), which
permits the evaluation of RNA replication in multiple cell types (Lulla and Firth, 2020). The
small astroviral genome size (~7 kb) compared to coronaviruses (~30 kb), allows for rapid
manipulation of sequences for anti-viral testing in a less restrictive environment than that
required to manipulate SARS-CoV-2.
Building on promising results in a cell-based reporter system, we used the astrovirus system to
test gapmer efficacy in the context of virus-like replication, where replicative intermediates are
generally physically occluded within host membrane derived vesicles, as is also the case in
bona fide virus infection. We generated chimeric astrovirus replicons bearing the s2m elements
from SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 5B). Chimeric replicons recapitulated the replication
properties of the wild-type astrovirus replicon (Fig. 5C), indicating that this system is suitable
for testing gapmers against multiple s2m sequences. To rule out any potential cell-specific
effects, all gapmers were tested in two human cell lines – Huh7.5.1 (Lulla and Firth, 2020) and
HEK293T (optimised for this study). The replication of replicons bearing SARS-CoV-2 s2m
sequences was efficiently inhibited by gapmers 1, 2, and 5, causing inhibition in the subPage 6 of 36

nanomolar range, with a less pronounced effect found for gapmers 3, 4, and 6. The inhibition
of non-specific control gapmers (“all” and “scr”) was significantly below their compositionmatched counterparts, gapmers 1-3 and 4-6, respectively (Fig. 5D). The same gapmers were
also tested against the SARS-CoV s2m in this system and found to be active, though with a
lower potency (Fig. 5E). This could potentially be attributed to differences arising from C-G
versus C-U juxtaposition within the respective s2m elements (Fig. 5B), leading to changes in
the s2m structure (Aldhumani et al., 2021), thus potentially affecting the s2m gapmer binding
properties. Replication in the presence of sufficient concentrations of gapmers 1, 2 or 5
dropped to the baseline level of the pO2RL-GNN mutant, which is completely deficient in
replication due to a mutated RdRp active site (Fig. 5C).
To assess the cytotoxicity and potential off-target effects of the tested gapmers, we (i)
performed a lactate dehydrogenase release-based cytotoxicity assay, and (ii) evaluated the
efficiency of cap-dependent translation in the presence of the different gapmer concentrations.
Consistent with previous work (Kaur et al., 2007), these assays showed no gapmer-induced
cellular toxicity (Fig. S4A). Translation inhibition of > 50% was only observed at 500 nM
concentrations of gapmers 1, 2, 5 and 6 (Fig. S4B), which is at least 10-fold higher than the
effective inhibition range for gapmers 1, 2 and 5. Overall, these results suggest that gapmers
targeting the s2m element can inhibit viral replication in the model replicon system in a dosedependent, sequence-specific manner without causing significant cell toxicity.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is inhibited by LNA gapmers targeting s2m
A high content screening (HCS) assay was developed to measure the effects of LNA gapmers
on infection in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Figure 6A shows a graphical
representation of the HCS assay workflow and an example representative microscopy image,
with cells stained for N protein (488 nm signal). We tested gapmers 1-6, “all” and “scr” at 0.25,
0.5 and 1 µM concentrations, a no-gapmer control, and 10 µM remdesivir treated cells as a
positive control. Our results indicate that gapmers 2 and 5 inhibit infection in a dose-dependent
manner, reducing virus replication (measured through N protein expression) to 10.4 and 6.9%,
respectively, of the non-treated control at 1 µM concentration, with cell viability at 72% and
83%, respectively. Furthermore, the inhibition levels are comparable to the 10 µM remdesivir
control in this assay (Fig. 6B). Gapmer 1, 3, and 6 have a less profound effect (27%, 31%, and
17% of non-treated control levels at 1 µM), whereas gapmer 4 shows the highest toxicity levels
besides inhibition to 13% of the non-treated control. In strong agreement with the astrovirus
replicon-based results (Fig. 5D), gapmers 2 and 5 demonstrate the most promising results in
SARS-CoV-2 inhibition assays (Fig. 6B), suggesting the suitability of these two gapmers for
therapeutic development. Consistent with our previous results on other cell lines (Fig. S4A),
the gapmers show no cytotoxic effect on Vero E6 cells in the absence of transfection reagent
(<5%, Fig. 6C), providing further confidence for potential therapeutic gymnotic delivery (Fazil
et al., 2016). These results are consistent with the astrovirus replicon-based approach and
indicate that gapmers may have sufficient access to their RNA target in infected cells and that
gapmers against the conserved s2m element may act as a viable anti-viral agent, warranting
their further exploration as therapeutics.
DISCUSSION
We have confirmed that the highly conserved structural element s2m in the 3ʹ UTR of SARSCoV-2 RNA is a site of vulnerability and a feasible candidate for ASO-based targeting by
designing LNA-based gapmer ASOs effective against the s2m element in vitro and in vivo. We

demonstrated physical gapmer-induced disruption of the RNA structure, consistent with
successful gapmer-target base-pairing interactions, and RNase H-induced target degradation in
vitro. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the s2m element can direct gapmer-induced
silencing of gene expression in GFP reporter assays in human cells, likely relying on the
demonstrated enzymatic activity of endogenous RNase H in the nucleus and the cytoplasm
(Liang et al., 2017).
We extended the observation by testing the ability of s2m-targeting gapmers to inhibit viral
replication in an astrovirus-based replicon model system, a rapid functional assay that does not
require access to higher containment level facilities. Viral replicon assays showed that gapmers
against s2m inhibit viral replication in a sequence-specific, dose-dependent manner, down to
sub-nanomolar range. These observations confirm that gapmers have significant potential as
RNA replication inhibitors. Results from SARS-CoV-2 infection assays in cell culture with
LNA gapmers targeting s2m are highly encouraging, with inhibition observed at the 0.25-1 µM
gapmer concentration range. Two of the tested gapmers, 2 and 5, provided consistent inhibition
results in both systems without increased cellular toxicity.
It is worth noting that coronaviruses produce double membrane vesicles inside infected host
cells, thought to conceal the viral double-stranded RNA replicative intermediate from cellular
defences (Hagemeijer et al., 2012; Knoops et al., 2008). These vesicles have been proposed to
be formed through virus-induced manipulations of the membrane of endoplasmic reticulum
(Blanchard and Roingeard, 2015). This compartmentalization of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in
membranous bodies within the host cell’s cytoplasm (Klein et al., 2020) may reduce access of
the ASOs to the s2m element or other viral genomic targets (although viral mRNAs, which all
contain s2m, should still be accessible). In this regard, it is useful to consider that LNA ASOs
have been conjugated with tocopherol and cholesterol for membrane association in the past
(Benizri et al., 2019; Nishina et al., 2015), which could increase ASO ability to find its target.
Improved membrane association may also boost gapmer entry into target cells. The primary
targets for the SARS-CoV-2 infection are the ACE2 receptor expressing airway cells, with the
virus infection gradually decreasing from the proximal to distal respiratory tract (Hou et al.,
2020). These cells might be amenable to aerosol delivery (Drevinek et al., 2020), enabling
highly targeted therapeutic administration.
When considering s2m as a target for virus inhibition, it is also worth noting that while it is a
remarkably stable genomic element, conserved across multiple groups of single-stranded
(+) sense RNA viruses, some mutations can arise over time. In the SARS-CoV-2 sequences
from Covid-19 patient samples, some s2m polymorphisms have been detected at positions 15
and 31, predicted to destabilise the stem loop structure (Vahed et al, 2020; Yeh and Contreras,
2020). Using a combination of several gapmers together offers a potential strategy to guard
against emerging resistance.
The results described here represent a promising start for further research into targeting
conserved elements in single-stranded (+) sense RNA viruses, and support development of
gapmers and related ASOs against the s2m element in particular. In the case of the SARS-CoV2, our gapmer designs offer a strong starting point for further therapeutic development, which
may include large scale optimisation and screening to maximise efficacy in cell culture and
animal models, as well as chemical modifications for optimal delivery to target cells.

alignment of the s2m element in the 3ʹ UTRs of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Lines indicate
base-pairing regions within the element. (B) The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV s2m
element (adapted from Robertson et al., 2005). (C) Chemical probing of the 3ʹ UTR of SARSCoV-2. RNA was denatured and refolded in the presence of 100 mM K+ and 0.5 mM Mg2+,
then incubated with NAI (+NAI channel) or DMSO control (-NAI channel). NAI modification
was detected by reverse transcription stalling and gel-based analysis. Sequencing lanes were
generated by adding ddT (for A), ddG (for C), ddC (for G) and ddA (for U) when performing
reverse transcription. The lower panel shows quantification of SHAPE signal in the s2m and
flanking regions. Calculation was based on the gel in Fig. 1C, by subtracting the signal of the
+NAI lane from that of the -NAI lane. The upper panel shows annotation of SHAPE signal on
the s2m structure. The bases with SHAPE signal of 0-0.2, 0.2-0.5, 0.5-0.8 and 0.8-2 were
coloured with green, yellow, orange and red, respectively. (D) Representative cryoEM image

gapmer indicated. RNA was denatured and refolded in the presence of 100 mM K+ and
0.5 mM Mg2+, then incubated with different amounts of gapmer (0×, 0.5×, 1×, 2× that of RNA)
and probed using NAI. (B, D, F, H) Quantification of A, C, E and G, respectively. Analysis of
the differences in SHAPE signal from SARS-CoV-2 3ʹ UTR alone and in the presence of
2× gapmer. Red arrows indicate the start and end points of gapmer target regions. (A and B)
The presence of gapmer 1 induced an increase in SHAPE signal at positions 70-74 and 79-94,
highlighted in orange, indicating that these nucleotides are more unstructured. A strong
decrease in SHAPE signal was observed at positions 60-69, highlighted in blue, indicating
decreased accessibility of these bases, which could be caused by their base-pairing with the
gapmer. (C and D) The reactivity profile in D is similar to that in B, due to the similar target
regions of gapmer 1 and gapmer 2. (E and F) In the presence of gapmer 3, nucleotides at
positions 69-75 are more structured, while nucleotides at positions 76-94 are less structured, as

MATERIALS AND METHODS
RNA preparation
3ʹ UTRs and the s2m 47-mer were prepared by in vitro transcription (IVT). Templates for IVT
were generated either by PCR, using Phire Hotstart II polymerase (Thermo Fisher) according
to manufacturer’s instructions, or by hybridising complementary DNA oligonucleotides
(Sigma). Sequences for the PCR primers and the DNA oligonucleotides are given in Table 2.
RNA generated by IVT was purified: IVT products were separated on polyacrylamide
denaturing gel (National Diagnostics), relevant bands were excised using UV shadowing and
electroeluted in TBE (Whatman Elutrap), then cleaned up using PureLinkTM RNA Microscale
Kit (Invitrogen). RNA concentrations were estimated using UV absorbance (A260nm) and a
calculated extinction coefficient.
Gel-based RNA cleavage assay
Each gapmer was pre-incubated with target RNA in 1× RNase H buffer (Thermo Scientific)
for 10 min at 37 C. 2.5 U of RNase H (Thermo Scientific) was then added and the reaction
incubated for 20 min at 37 C. Reactions were quenched by adding an equal volume of
proteinase K mix (0.5 mg/mL enzyme, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
12.5 mM EDTA, 1% w/v SDS) and incubating at 50 C for 20 min. RNA was visualised on
polyacrylamide 7.5 M urea gel (National Diagnostics) in TBE using SybrGold (Invitrogen).
Chemical probing of the 3ʹ UTR
To probe RNA structure without gapmers, 5 pmol RNA (~350 ng) was dissolved in 9 l
nuclease-free water, and denatured at 95 C for 90 s, then cooled on ice for 2 min. RNA was
refolded by adding 10 l of 2× SHAPE probing buffer (80 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mM KCl,
1 mM MgCl2) and incubating at 37 C for 15 min. 2-methylnicotinic acid imidazolide (NAI)
was added to a final concentration of 100 mM in 20 l reaction; in control reactions, same
volume of DMSO was added instead. Reactions were allowed to proceed at 37 C for 5 min
and then quenched by adding 10 l of 2 M DTT. RNA was purified by loading quenched
samples onto Micro Bio-spin Columns with Bio-Gel P-6 (BioRad), followed by ethanol
precipitation. Purified RNA was then dissolved in 6 μl water, reverse-transcribed into cDNA
and analysed by PAGE as described below.
To probe RNA structure with gapmers, different amounts of gapmers were added to refolded
RNA, at molar ratios of 0.5×, 1× or 2×, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The same volume
of water was added for the no-gapmer control. After co-incubation, RNA was probed using
NAI as described above. In addition, un-probed input RNA was also subjected to Sanger
sequencing: RNA was dissolved in 5 μl water and supplemented with 1 μl of 10 mM
corresponding ddNTP (Roche), then reverse-transcribed into cDNA and analysed by PAGE as
described below.
Reverse transcription and PAGE analysis of cDNA
6 μl of each RNA-containing sample was mixed with 1 μl of 5 μM Cy5-modified RT primer
(sequence given in Table 2) and 0.5 μl of 10 mM dNTPs. The mixture was incubated at 95 °C
for 3 min to denature the RNA and then cooled to 50 °C. RT reaction was started by adding
2 μl of 5× RT buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8.3, 500 mM LiCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT) and
0.5 μl Superscript III enzyme (Invitrogen), mixing quickly with a pipette tip. Reaction was
allowed to proceed at 50 °C for 20 min, then quenched by incubation at 85 °C for 10 min,
which inactivates the enzyme. In order to degrade RNA and liberate the complementary cDNA,

the reaction mix was then supplemented with 0.5 μl of 2 M NaOH and incubated at 95 °C for
10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× stopping buffer
(95% formaldehyde, 20 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, orange G dye) and
incubating at 95 °C for 5 min. The resulting cDNA sample was cooled down to 65 °C and
analysed on an 8% Acrylamide:Bis-Acrylamide-Urea gel by electrophoresis. The gel was
imaged using Typhoon FLA 9000 Gel Imager (GE healthcare).
Quantitative Gel Analysis and SHAPE Reactivity Calculation
Signal intensity of each band on the PAGE gel was detected using ImageQuant TL software
and normalized to the total signal of the whole lane. Raw reactivity was generated by
subtracting the signal of NAI channel from that of the DMSO control channel; reactivities with
negative values were corrected to 0. SHAPE reactivity was generated following the 2/8 %
normalization method (Low and Weeks, 2010). To calculate the differences in SHAPE signal
in the presence and absence of gapmers, the lanes of NAI channels with 2× gapmer (+gapmer)
or without gapmer (-gapmer) were used. The signal intensity of each band was normalized to
the total signal of the whole lane. Differences were calculated by subtracting the signal of the
+gapmer channel from that of the -gapmer channel and then rescaled to the signal of the gapmer channel.
Cryo electron microscopy
5 µM purified 3ʹ UTR in 10 mM Tris pH 7.6, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl was annealed by
sequential incubation at 95 °C for 2 min, at 50 °C for 2 min, at 37 °C for 5 min and then at
room temperature. The sample was supplemented with 1 mM MgCl2. 3 µl of the resultant
mixture was applied to glow-discharged (EasiGlow Pelco) R2/2 Quantifoil grids (Quantifoil).
Excess sample was blotted away with a FEI Vitrobot (IV) (100% humidity, 4 °C, blotting force
0, 3 s blot time) and the grids were vitrified in liquid ethane. The grids were screened with a
200 kV FEI Talos Arctica microscope with a Falcon III camera and a data set was collected on
a 300 kV FEI Titan Krios microscope equipped with a Gatan K3 camera. Motion correction,
ctf estimation and particle-picking were performed in Warp (Tegunov and Cramer , 2019) and
2D/3D alignments and averaging were carried out with cryoSPARC 2.15 (Punjani et al., 2017).
Gapmer reporter assays
The s2m sequence or control scrambled sequence of s2m (s2m_scr) was inserted into the
3ʹ UTR of GFP in H6P plasmid using In-Fusion Cloning kit (TaKaRa) and verified by
sequencing. HEK293ET, HeLa and A459 cells, as well as all stable cell lines, were grown in
IMDM medium supplemented with 10% FCS at 37 °C in 5% CO2. All cell lines tested negative
for mycoplasma. Constructs in H6P plasmids were used to produce recombinant lentivirus in
HEK293ET cells for the stable expression of GFP reporter in mammalian cells from a
constitutive SFFV promoter. HeLa and A549 stable cell lines were generated by lentiviral
transduction with low MOI (>0.3) to ensure single genomic integrations and were selected for
by drug resistance.
To examine the effect of gapmers on GFP expression, HeLa or A549 cells with a stably
integrated GFP-s2m/s2m_scr reporter were seeded at 5 × 104 cells per well in 24-well plates.
The following day, cells were transfected with gapmer to achieve 20 nM final concentration
using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Flow cytometry analysis was
performed 72 h after transfection. Cells were washed twice with warm PBS, detached with
trypsin and resuspended in IMDM. All samples were analysed on a BD LSR ii flow cytometer,
using the high throughput system (HTS), and at least 20,000 events were acquired for each
sample. Data were analysed in FlowJo (v10.7.1). Main cell population was identified and gated

on Forward and Side Scatter using the Auto Gate tool and plotted as a histogram to visualise
GFP intensity of cells (measured using B-525 detector).
Virus replicon assays
HEK293T cells (ATCC) were maintained at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics. Huh7.5.1 cells (obtained from Apath,
Brooklyn, NY; Zhong et al., 2005) were maintained in the same media supplemented with nonessential amino acids. All cells were mycoplasma tested (MycoAlertTM PLUS Assay, Lonza);
Huh7.5.1 cells were also tested by deep sequencing.
The HAstV1 replicon system is based on the HAstV1 infectious clone, where the virus genome
is left intact up to the end of ORFX, then followed by a foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A
sequence and a Renilla luciferase (RLuc) sequence fused in the ORF2 reading frame, followed
by the last 624 nt of the virus genome and a poly-A tail (Fig. 4A, GenBank accession number
MN030571; Lulla and Firth, 2020). The s2m mutations were introduced using site-directed
mutagenesis and all constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The resulting plasmids were
linearized with XhoI prior to T7 RNA transcription.
Huh7.5.1 and HEK293T cells were transfected in triplicate with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent
(Invitrogen), using the protocol in which suspended cells are added directly to the RNA
complexes in 96-well plates. For each transfection, 100 ng replicon, 10 ng firefly luciferaseencoding purified T7 RNA (RNA Clean and Concentrator, Zymo research), the indicated
amount of gapmers, and 0.3 µl Lipofectamine 2000 in 20 µl Opti-Mem (Gibco) supplemented
with RNaseOUT (Invitrogen; diluted 1:1,000 in Opti-Mem) were added to each well containing
5 × 104 cells in 100 µl DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h
(Huh7.5.1) or 18 h (HEK293T). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined using
the Dual Luciferase Stop & Glo Reporter Assay System (Promega). Replicon activity was
calculated as the ratio of Renilla (subgenomic reporter) to Firefly (cap-dependent translation,
loading control), normalized by the same ratio for the control replicon, as indicated for each
experiment. Three independent experiments, each in triplicate, were performed to confirm
reproducibility of results.
Cytotoxicity assays
The analysis of gapmer cellular cytotoxicity in HEK293T, Huh7.5.1, and Vero E6 cells was
performed using the CyQUANT LDH cytotoxicity assay (Thermo Scientific). Leaked
cytoplasmic enzyme LDH in cell culture supernatants was quantified after enzymatic
conversion, and absorbance was measured at 490 nm in a 96-well plate reader according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
SARS-CoV-2 production and infection
Vero E6 cells obtained from Oliver Schwarz (Institute Pasteur, Paris) were maintained in
DMEM modified with high glucose, L-glutamine, phenol red and sodium pyruvate
(ThermoFisher, #41966-029) supplemented with 10% FCS at 5% CO2. SARS-CoV-2 strain
BetaCoV/England/02/2020 (obtained from Public Health England) was propagated at 37°C on
Vero E6 cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS at 37 °C. The titer was determined by
plaque assay as follows: confluent monolayers of VeroE6 cells where grown on 6-well plates
and incubated with 200 μl of a 10-fold serial dilution of virus stock in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FCS for 1 h at room temperature. These cells were then overlaid with 0.5× DMEM
supplemented with 1% FCS and 1.2% Avicel (BMC Biopolymers, Belgium). After 4 days
incubation at 37 ℃, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS followed by staining with

0.1% toluidine blue (Sigma, #89640). The titer was calculated as plaque forming units (PFU)
per ml.
SARS-CoV-2 infection assay
Vero E6 cells (NIBC, UK) were grown in DMEM (containing 10 % FBS) at 37 °C and 5 %
CO2 in 96 well imaging plates (Greiner 655090). Cells were transfected with individual
gapmers at 0.25, 0.5 or 1 µM final concentration using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher),
according to manufacturer’s instructions. At 6 h post transfection, the media was replaced and
the cells were infected or mock infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection
0.5 PFU/cell. At 22 h post-infection, cells were fixed, permeabilised and stained for SARSCoV-2 N protein using Alexa488-labelled-CR3009 antibody (van den Brink et al., 2005) and
for nuclei (DRAQ7, 647 nm wavelength). The plate was imaged using the high content
screening microscope Opera Phenix from Perkin Elmer with a 5× lens. The Opera Phenixassociated software Harmony was used to delineate the whole well area and to determine the
total intensities of the Alexa488/N protein and DRAQ7/DNA signals per said whole well area
during image acquisition. The background subtracted Alexa488/N intensities were normalised
to vehicle treated samples. Toxicity was evaluated using the DRAQ7/DNA signal normalised
to mock treated wells and LDH release-based cytotoxicity assay.

Figure S1, related to Figure 1. SHAPE analysis of the extended 3ʹ UTR of SARS-CoV-2
(A) Chemical probing of the extended 3ʹ UTR of SARS-CoV-2 (including ORF10 and the
region immediately upstream of it). RNA was denatured and refolded in the presence of
100 mM K+ and 0.5 mM Mg2+, then incubated with NAI (+NAI channel) or DMSO control (NAI channel). NAI modification was detected by reverse transcription stalling and gel-based
analysis. Sequencing lanes were generated by adding ddT (for A), ddG (for C), ddC (for G)
and ddA (for U) when performing reverse transcription. (B) Quantification of SHAPE signal
on at the s2m element and flanking regions. Calculation was based on the gel in Fig. S1A, by
subtracting the signal of the +NAI lane from that of the -NAI lane. (C) Agreement of SHAPE
signal on s2m structure in the 3ʹ UTR and the extended 3ʹ UTR of SARS-CoV-2. Pearson
correlation coefficient was calculated based on the SHAPE signals shown in Fig. 1C and
