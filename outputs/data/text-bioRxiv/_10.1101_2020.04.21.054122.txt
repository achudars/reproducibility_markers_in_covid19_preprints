Abstract
The current coronavirus disease 2019 (​COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2
virus and is still spreading rapidly worldwide. Full-genome-sequence computational analysis
of the SARS-CoV-2 genome will allow us to understand the recent evolutionary events and
adaptability mechanisms more accurately, as there is still neither effective therapeutic nor
prophylactic strategy. In this study, we used population genetics analysis to infer the
mutation rate and plausible recombination events that may have contributed to the evolution
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, we localized targets of recent and strong positive
selection. The genomic regions that appear to be under positive selection are largely
co-localized with regions in which recombination from non-human hosts appeared to have
taken place in the past. Our results suggest that the pangolin coronavirus genome may have
contributed to the SARS-CoV-2 genome by recombination with the bat coronavirus genome.
However, we find evidence for additional recombination events that involve coronavirus
genomes from other hosts, i.e., Hedgehog and Sparrow. Even though recombination events
within human hosts cannot be directly assessed, due to the high similarity of SARS-CoV-2
genomes, we infer that recombinations may have recently occurred within human hosts
using a linkage disequilibrium analysis. In addition, we employed an Approximate Bayesian
Computation approach to estimate the parameters of a demographic scenario involving an
exponential growth of the size of the SARS-CoV-2 populations that have infected European,
Asian and Northern American cohorts, and we demonstrated that a rapid exponential growth
in population size can support the observed polymorphism patterns in SARS-CoV-2
genomes.

Introduction
In late December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia
cases epidemiologically linked with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, Hubei
Province, China ​(Huang et al., 2020)​. On January 7, 2020, these cases were associated with
a novel human coronavirus (hCoV), dubbed SARS-CoV-2 ​(Coronaviridae Study Group of the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 2020)​, ​which consists the third
documented spillover from mammals, but it is divergent from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
that caused past epidemics ​(Rota et al., 2003; Zaki et al., 2012)​. Two weeks later, the United
States of America reported the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection while the first
three cases in Europe were confirmed on January 24, 2020 ​(Holshue et al., 2020)​. As of
April 20, the pandemic coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus
disease 19 (COVID-19) has infected more than 2,397,216 people and has caused 162,956
deaths (WHO, COVID-19 Situation Report 92).
As the outbreak progresses over time, laboratories around the world are sequencing
SARS-CoV-2 genomes from various human sources and timepoints to track the dispersal
pattern of the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genera and
structurally is an enveloped RNA virus, with a non-segmented, positive-sense (+ssRNA)
genome of ~30 kb, amongst the largest identified RNA genomes ​(Andersen et al., 2020; Zhu
et al., 2020)​. The application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches on
pathogens can elucidate important features like disease transmission and virulence ​(Gwinn
et al., 2019)​. In fact, NGS data are accumulating with unprecedented speed, and t​he Global
Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database, which ​originally promoted the
international sharing of all influenza virus sequences, as of April 2, included 3,230
SARS-CoV-2 genome data sub​missions (2,305 full-length sequences with high-coverage).
Population genetics can provide insights into the spread and epidemics of viruses because it
offers the machinery to estimate the values of parameters such as the mutation and
recombination rate. Both of these parameters are important for the evolution and the
management of viral diseases. Mutation rate, recombination, as well as stochastic (random
genetic drift) and non-stochastic processes (selection) are the dominant forces that shape
viral diversity in natural populations of RNA viruses. In fact, due to the lack of proofreading in
RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, RNA viruses demonstrate the highest mutation rates of
any group of organisms ​(Moya et al., 2004)​, which may lead to viral adaptation to selective
pressures and alter their virulence. In addition, recombination has an important role in
evolution, by elevating haplotypic variability in viral populations and potentially generating
highly fitted genomes more rapidly than by mutation rate alone, especially if epistatic
interactions are present between different genomic locations. Research on viral
recombination rates has demonstrated its association with increased genetic diversity and
the generation of novel lineages and new pathogenic recombinant circulating viruses
(Combelas et al., 2011; Pérez-Losada et al., 2015)​. Actually, recent studies suggest that
recombination events may have shaped the architecture of SARS-CoV-2 genome by
demonstrating that it shares 96.3% genetic similarity with a bat CoV ​(Lu et al., 2020) and
91.2% genetically similarity with two pangolin CoV genomes ​(Andersen et al., 2020; Boni et

al., 2020; Lam et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019; Paraskevis et al., 2020)​. High mutation and/or
recombination rates imply that developing a successful vaccine will be challenging since viral
genomes will be able to adapt fast in human interventions ​(Andersen et al., 2020)​. Moreover,
population genetics provides tools to infer the recent evolutionary history of populations, both
adaptive and non-adaptive. Thus, by using statistical approaches, such as the Approximate
Bayesian Computation ​(Beaumont et al., 2002)​, it is feasible to assess past population size
changes by using only present-day genomic data. RNA viruses demonstrate immense
population sizes ​(Moya et al., 2004) and the study of the population demographic history
could support viral epidemiological research. A previous study, in particular, has associated
the change from a bat CoV population of constant size to a population growth of CoVs from
other hosts, with the interspecies transmission of viruses from their original reservoir to an
alternate host ​(Vijaykrishna et al., 2007)​. Furthermore, selective sweep theory ​(Kim &
Stephan, 2002; Maynard Smith & Haigh, 1974; Stephan et al., 1992) allows to localize the
targets of recent and strong selection on genomes.
In our study, we aim to elucidate the recent evolution of SARS-CoV-2 by implementing
population genetics approaches on full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes available at the
GISAID database (​https://www.gisaid.org/​). Understanding the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary
processes would enable us to assess critical parameters, such as the mutation rate, and
plausible recombinations, as well as recent selective sweeps and population demographic
parameters, which can directly affect the evolution of this virus within the human population.
Such results will support epidemiological research on tracing dispersal patterns of the
pandemic and designing therapeutic or preventive strategies.

Results
We used publicly available data of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the GISAID database,
downloaded on 2/4/2020. All analyses, but selective-sweep localization, were performed on
this dataset. The initial dataset comprises 3,230 full genome assembled sequences. From
those, we kept only the high-coverage sequences (as defined by GISAID, these sequences
contain less than 1% ambiguous states (N’s) and less than 0.05% unique amino acid
mutations, i.e., not seen in other sequences in the database, and no insertion-deletions
unless verified by submitters). In total, 2,305 pass this filter. We applied additional filters to
keep only high-quality sequences: First, we trimmed the ambiguous N’s from both the
beginning and the end of the genomes. Then, after trimming, we kept only sequences with
less than 10 ambiguous states (N’s). The final dataset consists of 1,895 SARS-CoV-2
genomes and two outgroup sequences: the bat CoV (hCoV-19/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013;
Accession
ID
EPI_ISL_402131)
and
pangolin
CoV
genomes
(hCoV-19/pangolin/Guangdong/1/2019; Accession ID: EPI_ISL_410721). The dataset was
aligned using the MAFFT software v.7.205 ​(Katoh & Standley, 2013)​.

Estimation of mutation rate and divergence from bat CoV
We modeled the divergence from the bat CoV genome as a function of the sequence
sampling date. Divergence was estimated using the Kimura80 approach ​(Kimura, 1980) as
implemented in libsequence C++ library ​(Thornton, 2003)​. Since the sampling date is known
(provided by the GISAID database), we were able to perform a regression analysis of the
divergence per site as a function of the sampling date. The slope of the line represents the
increase of divergence per site and per day, thus it may be used as a proxy for the mutation
rate per site and per day. The estimated mutation rate is 1.87 x 10​-6 per nucleotide
substitution per site per day (Figure 1), which is expected and in concordance with what has
been previously reported for SARS-CoV-1 (0.80 to 2.38×10​-3 per site and per year, i.e.,
2.24-6.68 x 10​-6 ​per site and per day) and ~10​-6 per site per cycle for other CoVs ​(Bar-On et
al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2004)​.

Figure 1​: Regression analysis of the divergence from the bat CoV genome as a function of
sampling date. The slope of the regression line (1.87 x 10​-6​) reflects the increase in
divergence per site and per day.
The divergence from the bat CoV genome is estimated to 0.04 substitutions per site using
the Kimura (1980) calculation. Assuming that the mutation rate is 1.87 x 10​-6​, the total time
since that separates SARS-CoV-2 from the bat CoV genome is 0.04/1.87 x 10​-6 ​= 58.6 years.
Thus, assuming an equal mutation rate between the bat CoV lineage and the human CoV
genome, the time since the common ancestor between the bat CoV and the SARS-CoV-2 is
about 58.6/2 = 29.3 years.

Recombination events

We performed a BLAST-based analysis using as a (locally constructed) database the 55
fully
sequenced
Coronaviridae
genomes
downloaded
from
NCBI
(​https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesGroup.cgi?taxid=11118​) together with the
bat CoV and pangolin CoV genomes from the GISAID database. The query comprises all
the unique 300-mers from the 1,895 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. In total, there are 452,212
unique 300-mers. The word size parameter of BLAST was set to 10 and the e-value to 0.1 to
capture even small parts of the sequence that may resemble parts from the Coronaviridae
family of different hosts. We checked whether consecutive regions in a query sequence
could match different entries in the local blast database, that is Coronaviridae sequences
from different hosts. Then, we estimated all correlation coefficients for all host pairs to

evaluate their tendency to co-occur as a match in the same query sequence (Figure 2). For
example, pangolin and bat co-occur in 395 out of 5568 total cases, resulting in an ​r ​value of
0.4. Such a high co-occurrence may suggest that an ancestral sequence of a query 300-mer
could have experienced a recombination event in these two hosts. We found plausible past
recombination events between CoVs from pangolin and bat, Sparrow and ​Rhinolophus blasii
(bat), and the hCoV-HKU1 genome with Hedgehog (​Erinaceus​).

Localization of recombination events
For the three pairs of hosts depicted in Figure 2, we localized the genomic regions that may
be involved in recombination events. Thus, for all concordant pairs, that is pairs
corresponding to consecutive matches between a query 300-mer and two different database
entries, we used the genomic coordinates of the non-SARS-CoV-2 host. The density plots in
Figures 2B, C and D illustrate the distribution of the location in the genome of the host. For
the pangolin/bat pair (Figure 2B), the location of both pangolin and bat fragments are around
the position 23,583, suggesting a plausible recombination event in the highly divergent Spike
protein S1 coding region. On the other hand, the Sparrow/Rhinolophus pair shows different

localization of the Sparrow and Rhinolophus fragments. The Sparrow fragments are located
around the location 3,484, whereas the Rhinolophus fragments around the position 28,034.
Thus, it is probable that an ectopic recombination event between ORF1a and ORF8 has
taken place, since it is common for viruses to exchange genetic material in a non-reciprocal
manner ​(Pérez-Losada et al., 2015) even though we cannot exclude the possibility of a false
positive result. Finally, the Hedgehog/Human_HCoV-HKU1 pair both locations are around
the position 17,000 (17,062 and 17,088, respectively), within the ORF1b polyprotein and the
helicase/nsp13 coding region.

Detection of recombination events amongst SARS-CoV-2 genomes
Using a similar approach as in “Host analysis”, we assessed whether recombination events
have taken place between the human SARS-CoV-2 genomes. No recombination event was
detected using the SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the GISAID database until the date
2/4/2020.

Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) analysis
An indirect approach to infer recombination in a sequence is the decay of LD as a function of
distance. We estimated LD between all sites using the software ​plink ​(Purcell et al., 2007)
and we modeled haplotypic LD as a function of distance between two genomic sites using a
simple linear model as LD = ​a​x + ​b​, where x is the distance. The analysis was performed on
the SARS-CoV-2 genomes for each population separately (Europe, Africa, North America,
South America, Oceania, Asia). Results for parameters ​a and ​b ​are presented in the
Supplementary Table S1. These results suggest that for the European, Asian and the total
population, LD is decreasing as a function of distance. Thus, recombination may have
occurred in SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These findings are not contradictory to the previous
section “Detection of recombination events between the SARS-CoV-2 genomes”. In the
previous section, our goal was to detect the recombination breakpoints and the recombinant
sequences (or the descendants of the recombinant sequences). However, if the sequences
are not divergent enough such an approach will not reveal the breakpoints. On the contrary,
the LD decay approach is more sensitive to show that recombination may have happened
(however, it can neither reveal the recombination breakpoints nor the recombinant
sequences). The Supplementary Table S1 shows that in the North America, South America,
Oceania and Africa populations, the value of the slope ​a is not statistically different than 0,
i.e., there is no correlation between the genomic distance and the LD. This is probably due
to the fact that the number of recombination events that take place in a population is a
function of both the recombination rate and the effective population size (ρ = 4Ν​e​r, where N​e
is the effective population size and r the recombination rate). Since, the exponential growth
phase started later in these continents compared to Asia and Europe, it is possible that the
effective population size of the virus was not large enough for recombination to be detected
in the North America, South America, Oceania and Africa populations.

Selective sweeps
Selective sweep analyses were done on the dataset downloaded on 31/3/2020 due to
extensive computational time requirements. We used SweeD ​(Pavlidis et al., 2013) and
RAiSD ​(Alachiotis & Pavlidis, 2018) to identify potential targets of selective sweeps. SweeD
implements a composite likelihood ratio test based on the site-frequency spectrum, while
RAiSD evaluates the μ statistic that relies on multiple sweep signatures. Supplementary
Figure S1 illustrates the scores of both tools along the genome when analyzing 1,601
SARS-CoV-2 sequences (version 31/3/2020) in the total population and per continent for
Europe, Asia, and North America. The figure also shows the top 5% common outliers. Given
the accuracy granularity of existing sweep detection methods, including the employed ones
in this study, we refrain from identifying specific genomic positions at site granularity.
Table 1 provides distinct region pairs that were identified as potential sweep targets. For the
world sample, the first two region pairs are located within the non-structural protein 3 (nsp3),
which is a large multidomain and multifunctional protein that plays a key role in coronavirus
replication. Previous studies report that the nsp3 represents a preferential selection target in
MERS-CoV and lineage C betaCoVs ​(Forni et al., 2016)​. The third region pair belongs to
Spike protein S1, which attaches the virion to the cell membrane by interacting with a host
receptor, thereby initiating the infection. The highly divergent Spike protein S1 of
coronaviruses facilitates viral attachment, fusion and entry, and thus serves as a target for
antibody and vaccine development ​(Tai et al., 2020)​. The identified outlier region
23,043-23,073 falls into the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which has been reported to be
optimized, as a result of natural selection, for binding to human angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and consists a putative target for designing future therapeutic or
preventive strategies ​(Andersen et al., 2020)​. The fourth region pair is in the spike protein
S2, which mediates the fusion of the virion and cellular membranes by acting as a class I
viral-fusion protein.

Summary statistics along the SARS-CoV-2 genome
We estimated the values of several summary statistics, commonly used in population
genetics studies, along the genome of SARS-CoV-2: (i) Watterson’s estimate ​(Watterson,
1975) of θ value (the population mutation rate); (ii) θ​π ​(Tajima, 1983)​, i.e., the average
number of pairwise differences in the sampled sequences, which is another estimate of θ;
(iii) Tajima’s D ​(Tajima, 1989)​, a commonly used neutrality test that receives negative values
typically in cases of population expansion and/or recent strong positive selection; (iv) Wall’s
B and Wall’s Q ​(Wall, 1999)​, which are related to the recombination rate; (v) the divergence
to the bat sequence using a random SARS-CoV-2 genome, the average divergence from the
bat Coronavirus sequence using all SARS-CoV-2 genomes and (vi) the Depaulis and Veuille
K and H statistics ​(Depaulis & Veuille, 1998)​, which denote the number of haplotypes and
the haplotype heterozygosity, respectively. The region around position 23,000 (Spike protein
S1/RBD) is characterized by large divergence, low Tajima’s D, and high values of Wall’s B
and Q. The divergence values (high) and the Tajima’s D values (low) suggest that it may be
a target of recent positive selection. The value of θ​W is high, which is due to the excessive
number of singletons in the region since θ​π does not receive very high values. This result is
consistent with positive selection, even though we cannot exclude artifacts from sequencing
errors or more complex evolutionary phenomena (e.g., recombination with another host).
Another probable explanation is that selective sweep is ongoing. Thus, there will still exist
several low-frequency polymorphisms decreasing Tajima’s D and maintaining high values for
θ​W​.

Estimation of the time of the most recent common ancestor
We used all samples to estimate the mean and the variance of the parameter ​t
​ ​= 47.0 and the
(Supplementary Figure S2). The mean parameter value estimation was ​test
variance 504.45. Supplementary Figure S2B, depicts the histogram, density and the mean
value for the parameter ​t​, the time of the most recent common ancestor measured in days
before the first Wuhan sample (24/12/2019). The estimated value of ​t suggests that the most
recent common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 genomes is quite older (47 days) than the first
reported case. The estimated value is similar, though a bit older, to the value presented in
NextStrain (​www.nextstrain.org​) using a regression analysis (NextStrain dates the TMRCA
on 14/12/2019 as estimated on April 21). Even though it is reasonable that the first case is
dated earlier than the first reported case, here, we cannot know whether the TMRCA refers
to a human sample or another host (e.g., bat).

Demographic inference
Exploring the demographic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 populations is important in
understanding the magnitude of the spread of the ​ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we
focused on the SARS-CoV-2 sequences of Asian, European and Northern American human
cohorts ​and we employed an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach to model
the exponential growth of the three SARS-CoV-2 populations. For each population, the
parameter inference procedure involves the estimation of the posterior distributions of two
​ nd the rate of exponential expansion ​α​.
parameters: the s​caled population mutation rate ​θ a
In this model of population growth the population size is given by: N(t) = N​0 e​−αt​, where time t
is measured backwards in time in units of 2N​0 generations and ​θ is defined as 2N​0​μ for
haploid organisms, where μ is the mutation rate per generation and N​0 the present-day
effective population size ​(Hein et al., 2005)​.
For each population under study, ABC employs stochastic coalescent simulations to
estimate properties of the parameters’ posterior distributions. The parameter inference
procedure consists in retaining only the best τ of the simulations, i.e., τ of the simulated
datasets which are closest to the observation (Supplementary Figure S3-5). Visualizing in a
contour plot the percentage of accepted simulations that was determine​d with a tolerance
τ=0.005 (Supplementary Figure S6-8​), demonstrates how these simulations explore the
space around the observed data. The summary statistics form an 8-dimensional space. For
some statistics (i.e., dimensions), the contour lines diverge from the observed value,
because the algorithm keeps the simulations that minimize the 8-dimensional Euclidean
distance to the observed vector. Thus, even if the distance is minimized over all dimensions,
this may not be true for each dimension separately. For example, the posterior distributions
of Tajima’s D and DVK of the European population in particular, show that the accepted
values (within the tolerance τ) are quite distant from the observed value. Specifically Tajma’s
D and DVK are affected by low frequency derived variants, especially singletons. Tajima’s D
becomes negative and DVK assumes large values in the presence of singletons since the
number of haplotypes increases. In the SARS-CoV-2 dataset a large proportion of
polymorphisms (>70%) are singletons, which results in extreme negative values of Tajima’s
D. Such a proportion of singletons is difficult to be explained with a simple demographic
model of population expansion alone. It is possible that other factors (e.g., sequencing
errors, more complex demographic models) have contributed to such an observation.
An improvement to the simple rejection ABC algorithm was employed to correct for the
discrepancy between the simulated and the observed statistics. The posterior probability of
the parameters was approximated by applying regression adjustment techniques to the
retained simulations. More specifically, we performed a local linear weighted regression
correction to estimate the posterior parameter probabilities of the American and the Asian
SARS-CoV-2 population while a non-linear regression model ​using feed-forward neural
networks was utilized in the demographic analysis of the European population. This
correction influenced our estimates, ​reducing the variance of the posterior estimates (Figure
4)​. The inferred mean, median and mode values, as well as quantile values are shown in
Table 2. Both α and θ values are higher in the Asian and North American populations than

the European population. This suggests that population growth was faster in Asia and North
America compared to the European population. Also, since θ = 2N​0​μ (N​0 is the present day
population size for each population) is higher for the Asian and North American population, it
suggests that Ν​0 is higher in Asia and North America than Europe. We note that N​0 is
different from the effective population size: the effective population size N​e represents
a
​
long-term ideal population size, while N​0 refers only to the present. Furthermore, we note
that ​a-posteriori t​ he two parameters α and θ are correlated (Supplementary Figure S9).
Thus, the likelihood surface may have multiple local optima and the inference process may
result in different optima (and therefore, parameter estimates) in different populations.

Methods
Mutation rate analysis and estimation of the time of the most recent
common ancestor between bat CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
Let μ the mutation rate per nucleotide and per day. The collection date of the samples has
been recorded in the GISAID repository. Let ​hi​ ​be the collection date for sample ​i​. If we
perform a regression analysis of the number of nucleotide differences (divergence) ​divi​
between sample ​i ​and the bat Coronovirus sequence as a function of collection date, there
should be a relation of the form: ​divi​ ​= ​h​i ​* μ + β, i.e., the divergence between sample ​i and
the bat Coronavirus increases linearly with time. The parameter β denotes the intercept, i.e.,
the divergence of the first sampled SARS-CoV-2 sequence in Wuhan. To estimate the
parameter μ, we calculated the slope of the regression line that models divergence as a
function of sampling date. Furthermore, the point that this line crosses the x-axis (the axis of
dates), denotes the time point t​bat/Cov2 at
which the divergence between bat and SARS-CoV-2
​
is 0, i.e., the time of the most recent common ancestor between bat and SARS-CoV-2.

Recombination analysis
Recombination evaluation was performed with a blast-based analysis. Let D​S (Dataset
Sars)
​
denote the SARS-CoV-2 fasta dataset as it was downloaded from the GISAID database.
Furthermore, D​C (Dataset Coronavirus) the dataset with 55 Coronaviridae sequences
downloaded from NCBI and with the pangolin and bat sequences from GISAID (thus, 57
sequences in total), and D​BP (Dataset pangolin/bat) is a dataset with only two sequences, the
bat and the pangolin sequence from GISAID. First, using D​S​, we generated a new dataset
​ S​​ .
called D​SS ​(Dataset Sars Split) which comprises all the unique 300-mers from the ​whole D
To detect potential contribution of bat/pangolin recombinant sequences into SARS-CoV-2 we
blasted the D​SS dataset against the D​BP dataset (i.e., D​BP is the blast database and D​SS the
query set). If a sequence D​SS,i (or an ancestral sequence of it) is the result of recombination
between the bat Coronavirus sequence and the pangolin Coronavirus sequence, then the
sequence will be matched to both bat and pangolin in consecutive parts of it. Thus, if D​SS,i is
​
a sequence of length L (here L = 300bp), we are looking for blast results of the the form: D​SS,i
[​a,​ ​b]​ matches to bat/pangolin and D​SS,i​[c, d] matches to pangolin/bat, where 1 ≤ ​a ≤ ​b ≤ ​c ≤ ​d
≤ L. We applied also the following restrictions: 1 ≤ ​a ≤ 10, L-10 ≤ ​d ≤ L, |​b - c|​ ≤ 20. In other
words, ​a s​ hould be in the beginning of the 300-mer, ​d s​ hould be at the end of the 300-mer
and the distance between the bat-like and the pangolin-like parts should be smaller than 20.
To detect other potential recombination events, we used as a blast database the D​C dataset
to search for recombinants from other hosts besides bat and pangolin. Furthermore, to
detect recombination between human SARS-CoV-2 sequences, or their unsampled
ancestral sequences, we used as a blast database the D​S dataset. The specific parameters
for running ​blastn were the following: -outfmt 6 (to present the results in a tabulated format),
-word_size 10 (to capture even small fragments) and -evalue 0.1 (also, to be able to capture
small fragments).

Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)
An indirect approach to infer recombination in a sequence is the decay of LD as a function of
distance. Given the demographic model, LD between two sites may be decreased either due
to recombination events or due to recurrent mutations, violating, thus, the infinite site model
(Kimura, 1969). From these two causal reasons of LD decay, only recombination decreases
LD as a function of the distance between two sites since the recombination rate is
proportional to the distance of the two sites. We used ​plink to estimate haplotypic LD
between all possible pairs of polymorphisms in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Then, we
modeled LD as a linear function of distance (assuming that the recombination rate is
constant along the genome) as follows:
LD = ​ax ​+ ​b,​ where ​x is the distance between two sites and ​a and ​b the slope and intercept,
respectively.
If ​a is negative, then it supports the presence of recombination on the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
On the other hand, if ​a ​is not statistically different than 0, then recombination may not be a
reason for LD patterns along the genome.

Selective sweeps and common outliers
To estimate potential targets of selective sweeps, we deployed the software tools SweeD
(Pavlidis et al., 2013) and RAiSD ​(Alachiotis & Pavlidis, 2018)​. A selective sweep analysis
detects characteristic patterns of polymorphisms attributed to the action of recent and strong
positive selection from a new allele. The key mechanism that generates such polymorphic
patterns is the fast increase of the beneficial mutation and the recombination rate ​(Pavlidis et
al., 2008)​. Currently, the whole population of SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly expanding.
Furthermore, even though recombination may be present in viruses, our analyses did not
find evidence of recombination among human SARS-CoV-2 sequences. This outcome does
not suggest that recombination is absent, but rather that diversity within the human
SARS-CoV-2 is not large enough to allow the detection of recombination events. Thus, a
selective sweep analysis may still be meaningful for SARS-CoV-2.
We performed a selective sweep analysis for each separate population (Asia, Europe, North
America, South America, Oceania, Africa) and for the total worldwide sample. SweeD was
executed using its default parameters and a grid size of 5,000 positions along the genome
(-grid parameter), which led to the calculation of a CLR score every 6 nucleotides, on
average. Due to the tool's high computational complexity for computing the site frequency
spectrum, which can lead to prohibitively long execution times when the sample size
increases, we used a smaller sample size for the worldwide analysis. The SweeD-based
analysis of the employed dataset, which comprised 1,601 genomes, required 112 CPU
hours. Initial analyses with smaller sample sizes (performed as data were becoming
available online for a period of three weeks) revealed that SweeD results remain largely
identical when the sample size exceeds 1,000 sequences.
Unlike SweeD, which relies on maximum-likelihood estimation at predefined positions along
the data, RAiSD computes the μ statistic using a polymorphism-driven sliding-window
algorithm. RAiSD was executed using a sliding-window size of 8 polymorphisms (-w

parameter) and a step of 1 polymorphism (default). We also increased the slack for the SFS
edges to 2 (-c parameter), which directed the tool to also consider doubletons and
polymorphisms that belong to the S-2 class in the calculation of the μSFS factor, where S is
the sample size. The default value for the SFS edge slack is 1, considering only singletons
and polymorphisms in the S-1 class.
To conduct a common-outlier analysis based on the results obtained by SweeD and RAiSD,
we implemented a series of extensions directly in the source code of RAiSD. More
specifically, we introduced a new parameter (-G) that specifies the grid size similarly to
SweeD, which directs RAiSD to report scores at the same positions as SweeD when the
same grid size is given. Given the RAiSD polymorphism-driven approach, however, scores
for the required positions are calculated using linear interpolation based on the initially
evaluated positions. To detect common-outlier regions, we sort the evaluated positions in
each of the tool reports based on their associated scores, and set the top 0.05 value as the
cutoff threshold per method. This allowed us to identify all outlier positions per tool.
Thereafter, we compute all pairwise base distances between SweeD and RAiSD outlier
positions, and report candidate outlier position pairs if the evaluated positions are closer than
400 bases. The common-outlier analysis was integrated as a feature in RAiSD to facilitate
reproduction of the results. The following example command line was used to detect
common-outlier regions:
RAiSD -I inputFile -n runName -CO SweeDReport 1 2 -COT 0.05 -O -COD 400 -c 2 -w 8 -G
5000
The -CO parameter provides a path to the SweeD report, as well as the column indices for
the positions and the scores. The -COT and -COD parameters specify the cutoff threshold
for the outliers and the maximum distance between SweeD/RAiSD outlier positions,
respectively.

Estimation of the time of the most recent common ancestor
To estimate the time of the most recent common ancestor, we applied the following: Let x​0
be the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from the first reported patient in Wuhan. This
sampling/collection date is 24/12/2019. Any other sequence y​i will have a common ancestor
with x​0 at some time t​i as shown in Supplementary Figure 1, earlier than the date
24/12/2019. To assess t​i we need to consider the differences (diversity), δ​i​, between x​0 and
y​i​. The older t​i is, the more differences on average will exist between x​0 and y​i​. In general, the
expected number of differences, δ​i​, between x​0 and y​i will be δ​i = (D​i + 2t​i​)μ​l​, where μ is the
mutation rate per base per day, ​l ​is the length of the genome (here we used the value
30,000bp), and D​i the number of days between the sampling date of x​0 and y​i​. Substituting δ​i
with the observed number of pairwise differences between x​0 and y​i​, μ = 1.87 x 10​-6 (see
“Estimation of mutation rate and divergence from bat” in Results), we can estimate t​i for
sample ​i​. Finally, we estimated the expected [t​i​] and the variance V​t of t​i as the average of
t​i​’s, and the sample variance, respectively. The reason behind using the first reported patient
in Wuhan is that the common ancestor between this sequence and any other sequence
should be either on 24/12/2019 or earlier than this date. Contrary, it is possible that any two

different sequences y​i and y​j (sampled later during the pandemia) have a common ancestor
more recently than the date 24/12/2020, thus it would not be possible to use them in order to
estimate the time of the most recent common ancestor.

Demographic inference
Demographic analysis was performed in an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)
framework. ABC is a bayesian approach that bypasses the exact likelihood computation by
using stochastic simulations and summary statistics. ​(Beaumont et al., 2002)​. In our
analysis, we are modeling the demography of the SARS-CoV-2 dataset that has infected
Asian, European and Northern American cohorts. An important approximation in an ABC
analysis, is the replacement of the full data by a set of summary statistics. These are
numerical values calculated from the data, so that they represent the maximum amount of
information in the simplest possible form ​(Csilléry et al., 2010)​. The summary statistics were
calculated from the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of each population’s sequences by
msABC ​(Pavlidis et al., 2010) and include (1) estimates of genetic diversity: the Watterson’s
estimator ​θw ​(Watterson, 1975) and the mean pairwise differences of sequences ​θπ ​(Tajima,
1983)​, (2) summary of the site frequency spectrum in the form of Tajima’s D ​(1989)​, (3) the
average pairwise correlation coefficient ZnS ​(Kelly, 1997) as a measure of linkage
disequilibrium, (4) two haplotype-based statistics ​(Depaulis & Veuille, 1998)​: the number of
haplotypes calculated by the Depaulis and Veuille K (​DVK)​ and the haplotype diversity
measured by the Depaulis and Veuille H (​DVH)​ and (5) the Thomson estimator of the time of
the most recent common ancestor TMRCA ​(Thomson et al., 2000) and its variance ​(Hudson,
2007)​.
In order to estimate the parameters of a demographic scenario involving an exponential
growth of the population size, we created simulations of neutral polymorphism data. Inferring
the demographic history of one population at a time, we generated sets of 500,000
coalescent simulations using msABC ​(Pavlidis et al., 2010)​. In that framework, every
evolutionary scenario was defined by a set of parameters and every parameter was
characterized by a prior distribution (Table 3). Given the current effective size of a population
N​0​, the expansion model is characterized by two parameters: the scaled population mutation
rate θ and the rate of exponential expansion α. Therefore, the population size is given by:
N(t) = N​0 e​−αt​, where time t is measured backwards in time in units of 4N​0 generations and θ
is defined as 2N​0​μ for haploid organisms, where μ is the mutation rate per generation ​(Hein
et al., 2005)​. Since there was no clear evidence that recombination has taken place within
SARS-CoV-2 genomes, the population recombination rate ρ of all the simulations was set to
zero. For each population, the number of individuals sampled per simulation was equal to
the number of sequences in the multiple sequence alignment.
The ABC parameter inference was implemented using the R package abc ​(Csilléry et al.,
2012)​. The inference procedure consists in retaining simulations for which the Euclidean
distance between the set of simulated summary statistics and the observed set is sufficiently
small. The percentage of accepted simulations is determined by the tolerance value,
τ=0.005. Ιn order to correct for the discrepancy between the simulated and the observed
statistics, due to the non-zero τ, the posterior probability of the parameters was

approximated by applying regression adjustment techniques to the retained simulations.
More specifically, we performed a local linear weighted regression correction to estimate the
posterior parameter probabilities of the American and Asian SARS-CoV-2 populations. In
this approach, the simulated parameters are assigned weights according to how well the
corresponding summary statistics adhere to the observed ones and then a linear regression
adjustment is performed to the accepted, weighted parameters ​(Beaumont et al., 2002)​. The
parameters were ‘logit’ transformed prior to estimation, using as boundaries the prior
distributions' minimum and maximum values that were used during simulations for each
parameter. After the regression estimation, the parameters were back-transformed to their
original scale. A non-linear heteroscedastic regression model ​using a feed-forward neural
network model was utilized in the demographic analysis of the European population ​(Blum &
François, 2010)​.
