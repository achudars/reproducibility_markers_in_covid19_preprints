ABSTRACT: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently spreading and mutating with increasing speed worldwide. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a simple, sensitive, and high-throughput
(HTP) assay to quantify virus-host interaction in order to quickly evaluate infectious ability of mutant virus and develop or validate virus-inhibiting drugs. Here we have developed an ultrasensitive bioluminescent biosensor to evaluate
virus-cell interaction by quantifying the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) both in living cells and in vitro. We have successfully used this
novel biosensor to analyze SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants, and evaluated candidate small molecules (SMs), antibodies,
and peptides that may block RBD:ACE2 interaction. This simple, rapid and HTP biosensor tool will significantly expedite detection of viral mutants and anti-COVID-19 drug discovery processes.

The recent outbreak of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes
human respiratory disease called COVID-19 in China
and worldwide. At the time of writing this manuscript,
over 40 million cases and 1 million deaths have been
attributed to the virus. The key in the fight against this
virus is the development of fast, accurate, sensitive diagnostic tools, and potent therapeutic drugs. Most recently, multiple tools, which include fast detection of
viral mRNAs and anti-viral antibodies (IgM and IgG) in
COVID19+ patients, have been developed1. However,
drugs effectively eradicating the virus are still lacking.
Currently, the most promising approach to stop the virus
is to develop vaccine against this virus. However, vaccine development and testing usually require long time
(>12 months). In addition, as for vaccines against other
types of virus such as SARS, there is no guarantee that
the vaccine will work. Moreover, given the nature of this
SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is also possible that it will become endemic and circulate in the population like seasonal influenza virus (flu). And, like the flu, it could
mutate into new strains that escape the vaccines. Therefore, for the long-term fight against COVID-19, other
long-lasting therapeutic drugs targeting this virus are
also required.

Beside vaccines, two major approaches have been
proposed or reported to target the SARS-CoV-22: 1) Use
of SMs, antibodies or peptides to inactivate proteins involved in viral entrance [e.g. viral Spike (S) protein
(anti-S antibodies)], processing [e.g. cleavage by proteases Mpro and 3CLpro (Lopinavir-ritonavir), and endocytosis (e.g. hydroxychloroquine)], and replication [e.g.
RNA polymerase (remdesivir)]; 2) Use of convalescent
plasma/sera containing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
from recovered patients. However, up until now, there
are no developed drugs used in clinical treatment that
can effectively treat COVID-19 and resulting in reduced
mortality. Since clinical trials usually take years to accomplish, there is an urgent need for tools that can
quickly test the effectiveness of candidate anti-virus
drugs to expedite the discovery processes. In addition,
although many SARS-CoV-2 mutants have been detected in new COVID-19 patients globally3, there is no simple, fast and accurate way to test whether these mutants
will affect their entrance into cells via changed interaction with ACE2 on the cell membrane.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 enters human
epithelial cells by using the RBD of its S protein to attach to a receptor called ACE2 protein on the cell sur-

face4. Therefore, blocking RBD:ACE2 protein-protein
interaction (PPI) will be an excellent strategy to curb
virus entrance/invasion into cells and their subsequent
infection5. The gold standard to test the effect of
RBD/ACE2 mutation, drugs or antibodies on their interactions is to use viral neutralization assays using either
live virus6 or viral vectors pseudotyped with the S protein7. However, these in vivo virus-based assays require
a level III biosafety facility and are time-consuming to
run. Although some in vitro protein-based assays such as
surface plasmon resonance (SPR)8 and ELISA9-11 have
also been developed in analyzing RBD:ACE2 interactions, they are less sensitive (color detection) and technically challenging (require purification of proteins from
mammalian cells and multiple steps or special equipment to perform), which makes them difficult to operationalize in most research and clinical labs. Therefore, a
simple, sensitive, and fast assay that can be used to perform HTP screening or validation for drugs blocking
RBD-ACE2 PPI for anti-COVID-19 therapy is required.
In 2016, an ultrasensitive split luciferase complementary assay (SLCA) called NanoLuc Binary Technology
(NanoBiT) was developed to monitor PPIs 12. This assay
is based on the observation that the NanoLuc luciferase
enzyme can be separated into two fragments, 18 kDa
Large BiT (LgBiT or Lg) and 11 amino acids (aa) small
BiT (SmBiT or Sm) with each fragment fused to a target
protein of interest. PPI of these two proteins can lead to
reconstitution of active NanoLuc luciferase from the
LgBiT and SmBiT and emit light in the presence of its
substrate furimazine. By using this technology, we successfully constructed a NanoBiT YAP:TEAD biosensor
and successfully used it to screen and identify SMs disrupting YAP-TEAD PPIs in cancer therapy13. In this
study, we have used this simple and powerful technology and developed the first NanoBiT biosensor to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RBD:ACE2 PPI both in vitro and in
vivo. We have also validated this biosensor to test the
effects of SMs, antibodies, and peptides on RBD:ACE2
PPIs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials. Chemicals were purchased from SigmaAldrich or Bioshop unless otherwise stated.
Biosensor plasmid construction and in vitro
mutagenesis. To construct SARS-CoV-2 RBD:ACE2
biosensor (SRAE2-BS), RBD (aa. 319-685) or ACE2
ectodomain (aa. 18-615) was first amplified from by
PCR from codon optimized SARS-Cov-2 (2018-nCoV)
Spike S1 ORF (SinoBiologicals Inc.) or human ACE2
cDNAs (SinoBiologicals Inc.; accession number
NM_021804.1), respectively, using PrimStar DNA
polymeras (Takara Bio). LgBiT, SmBiT, GS linker
(GSSGGGGSGGGGSSG), or 6×His tag (Fig. 1A) was
added into either N- or C-terminal PCR products of the
RBD or ACE2 by including their sequences in primers

or by overlapping PCR (see Table 1S for primer
sequences). The amplified PCR products were digested
with
EcoRV/NicoI
and
subcloned
into
pFUSE_hIgG1_Fc2 mammalian expression vector
(Invivogen), which contains a N-terminal IL2 secretion
signal peptides (SP).
PCR was used to construct SRAE2-BS plasmids with
ACE2 or RBD deletions, whereas overlapping PCR was
used to make in vitro mutagenesis. The primer
sequences were described in Table S2.
Cell culture. HEK293T (human embryonic kidney)
cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM; Sigma D6429) containing 10% FBE,
and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C
with 5% CO2.
DNA Transfection and western blot analysis.
About 1 μg/well of SRAE2-BS plasmid was transfected
into HEK293T cells in 6-well plate using PolyJet transfection reagent (SignaGen). Two days after transfection,
protein was extracted using RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM
Tris.HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). 10-20
μg extracted protein lysates were separated by 10%
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)(BioRad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The
blot was first probed with anti-6×His mouse monoclonal
antibody (Abcam ab18184), followed by incubation with
goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson
ImmunoResearch). The signal was detected using ECL
chemiluminescence substrate and visualized using an
Amersham Imager 600UV.
Peptide design and synthesis. The interrupting peptides were designed based on the analysis of the binding
sequences between the SARS-CoV2 spike glycoprotein
and ACE2, particularly, the amino acid residues between
446 and 505 on RBD and residues 19-393 on ACE2,
which was believed to form hydrogen bonds with ACE2
residues 19-393 at SARA-CoV-2 RBD/ACE-2
interface8, 14, 15. The final sequences of the modified peptides were optimized by using peptide-protein docking
software, HPEPDOCK16 and HADDOCK17. The peptides with top docking energy scores were selected for
the biosensor binding assay. Peptides were synthesized
on a Liberty Blue microwave aided peptide synthesizer
(CEM Corporation) using solid phase methodology and
Fmoc-protecting group strategy on a Rink Amide
MBHA resin (Gyrosprotein Technologies). In each peptide-build-up cycle, 20% piperidine in DMF (N,Ndimethylmethanamide) was used for N-terminal Fmocdeprotection and N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC)
/Oxyma were used as coupling reagents. Synthesized
peptides were cleaved from resin in TFA cleavage cocktail containing trifluoroacetic acid, phenol, deionized
water, thioanisole and 1,2-ethanedithiol (82.5:5:5:5:2.5

NanoLuc luciferase (NanoBiT) assay.
For
analysis of biosensor activity in living cell in vivo,
2×104 HEK293T cells were seeded in triplicate in 96well plate 24 hours before transfection. 100 ng of LgRBD, RBD-Lg, Sm-ACE2, or ACE2-Sm plasmids
were transfected alone or together into HEK293T cells
using PolyJet transfection reagent (SignaGen). 24
hours after transfection, the medium was transferred to
new wells. The attached cells were lysed in 20 μl of 1×
passive lysis buffer (1× PLB, Promega) at room
temperature (RT) for 15 min. 20 μl of cell lysate or
medium were subjected to NanoLuc luciferase assay
using Nano-Glo Live Cell Reagent containing 1/50
diluted furimazine substrate (Promega). Relative
Luminescence Unit (RLU) was measured using
GloMax Navigator Microplate Luminomer (Promega).
For analysis of biosensor activity in vitro, 500

HPLC coupled with 6100

ng/well of wild-type (WT) or mutant (deletions or
point mutations) Sm-ACE2 or RBD-Lg were
transfected into 12-well plate using PolyJet

transfection, cells were lysed in 1× PLB at RT for 15
min. Protein concentration were quantified using RC
DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). Protein lysates were
diluted into 1 μg/μl and kept at -80 oC. For in vitro
biosensor analysis, equal amounts of WT or mutant
RBD-Lg and Sm-ACE2 were mixed together in 10 μl
and incubated at RT for 30 min. 10 μl of 1/50 diluted
furimazine substrate were added, followed by
measurement of RLU using GloMax Microplate

were extracted, quantified, diluted, and stored as described above. For examination of the effect of candidate drugs on biosensor activity, triplicate of increasing
amounts (0-1000 μM) of SMs [Baicalin, Hesperidin,

(R&D#LMAB10541) were preincubated with 1 μg of
Sm-ACE2 protein lysate in 10 μl in 96-well plates on
a rocker at RT for 30 min. 1 μg/10 μl of Sm-ACE2
protein lysates were added and the mixture was incubated on a rocker at RT for another 30 min. For peptides targeting ACE2 (RBD-P1~3), increasing concentrations (1-100 μM) of peptides were preincubated
with Sm-ACE2 protein lysate for 30 min, followed by
incubation with RBD-Lg protein lysates. 10 μl of 1/50
diluted furimazine substrate were added into each well.
The mixtures were incubated on a rocker for 2 min,
followed by measurement of RLU using GloMax
Microplate Luminometer (Promega). All experiments
were repeated at least twice. The mean and standard
error (S.E.) of triplicate samples were calculated.
Statistical analysis. Student’s t-test (2-tailed) was
used for statistical analysis. A value of P ≤ 0.05 was
accepted as statistically significant.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To build the NanoBiT bioluminescent biosensor monitoring the RBD:ACE2 PPI, we first construct biosensor
plasmids by fusing LgBiT or SmBiT with RBD or ACE2 ,
respectively, at their N- or C-termini. Interaction of RBD
and ACE2 will make complementation of LgBiT and
SmBiT to form NanoLuc luciferase, which will emit light
in the present of its substrate furimazine (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis of each construct shows that while similarly high levels of Lg-RBD-His and RBD-Lg-His were
expressed in cells, relatively low levels of Sm-ACE2-His
and ACE2-Sm were expressed (Fig. 1C). Luciferase
analysis of biosensor activity indicates that transfection of
each component of the biosensor alone had little
luciferase activity, whereas the combination of Sm-ACE2
and RBD-Lg obtained the highest activity in both protein
lysate extracted from cells transfected with plasmids and
collected cell culture medium (secreted biosensor)(Fig.
1D). To analyze the biosensor activity in vitro, we combined increasing amounts (0-10 μg) of Sm-ACE2 protein
lysates with equal amounts of RBD-Lg lysates in vitro
and incubated at RT for 30 min, followed by luciferase
analysis. Significantly, combination of only 1 μg of protein lysate of Sm-ACE2 and RBD-Lg can obtain over
1× 105 RLU. The signal intensity linearly increases
with increasing amounts of cell lysates added (Fig.
1E). These data strongly suggest that we are able to
quantify RBD-ACE2 PPI both in vivo in cells and in
vitro using protein lysates extracted from plasmid-

transfected cells. This newly developed bioluminescent
biosensor tool is simple (only a luciferase assay in
vitro), sensitive (~0.2-1 μg crude cell lysate per assay;
no protein purification is required), fast (30 min in
vitro), accurate (quantified by light emission unit),
HTP (96-well or 394-well plate) and cheap (<1$ per
assay).
Next, we are going to use this biosensor to test the
functional domains of RBD interacting with ACE2.
Previous studies indicate that the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the RBD (Fig. 2A) is more important for
its interaction with ACE218. We have made RBM-Lg
construct and compared its activity with that of RBD in
vitro. Although RBD-Lg and RBM-Lg were expressed
at similar levels in cells (Fig. 2B), compared to RBDLg/Sm-ACE2, the biosensor activity of RBM-Lg/SmACE2 in vitro is only 20% of that of RBD-Lg/SmACE2, suggesting that other sequences downstream of
RBM (aa. 541-685) are also important for its interaction with ACE2. Previous structural study shows that
the peptidase domain or ectodomain (aa. 18-615) of
ACE2 (Fig. 2D) is important for its interaction with
RBD8. However, the minimum region required for the
interaction of ACE2 with RBD has not been mapped.
To map the minimum region of ACE2 critical for its
interaction with RBD, we further truncated the protease domain (Fig. 2D). Our biosensor analysis shows
that although similar protein levels were detected for
Sm-ACE2-18-615 and Sm-ACE2-18-515 (Fig. 2E), the
biosensor activity of Sm-ACE2-18-515/RBD-Lg was
significantly lower than that of Sm-ACE2-18615/RBD-Lg (Fig. 2F). Further ACE2 deletion (SmACE2-18-415) stabilized the ACE2 protein (Fig. 2E)
but reduces biosensor activity (Fig. 2F), suggesting
that aa. 18-615 of ACE2 has the full-length RBDbinding domain. Based on structure of ACE2-RBD
complex14, we also mutated 4 residues on ACE2 important for binding of ACE2 to RBD. Although similar
levels of proteins were expressed for both WT and mutant ACE2 (Fig. 2G), in vitro luciferase assay shows
that mutation of ACE2 K31 or M82 into alanine (A)
significantly reduces biosensor activity (Fig. 2H). Furthermore, mutation of ACE2 K353 into alanine almost
abolish biosensor activity (Fig. 2H). These findings not
only confirm the specificity of our SRAE2-BS but also
identify K353A as a critical residue for RBD:ACE2
PPI.
Currently, no SMs disrupting RBD:ACE2 PPI have
been used for COVID-19 clinical treatments. Most
studies predict candidate SMs inhibiting RBD:ACE2
PPI by using computer modeling5, 19, 20. We have used
our SRAE2-BS to test several candidate SMs (i.e.
Baicalin, Hesperidin, Sculellarin, Theaflavin, and Heparin) predicted by computer modeling to be able to
disrupt RBD-ACE2 PPI19-21. Surprisingly, out of 5
SMs tested, only Theaflavin can significantly suppress
SRAE2-BS activity with an IC50 of 41.7 μM (Fig. 3A).

This result suggests that a functional analysis such as
our biosensor assay is required to finally validate the
true SMs disrupting RBD-ACE2 PPI. Monoclonal antibodies have previously been shown to be able to bind
to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and disrupt RBD-ACE2 interac-

tion, which inhibits viral entrance into cells22. We have
used a VHHR72 anti-RBD antibody, which has previously been shown to effectively inhibit RBD-ACE2
PPI10, 23, to test our biosensor. The biosensor activity is
suppressed by

VHH72 rather than IgG control in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 4B). We next synthesized peptides based
on RBD-ACE2 complex structure and peptide-protein
docking ranking8, 14. Although ACE2-P1 has no effect
on SRAE2-BS activity, ACE2-P2 significantly suppresses SRAE2-BS with IC50 of 42 μM (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, different from ACE2-derived peptides targeting virus RBD, peptides RBD-P1, P2, P3 targeting
ACE2 significantly suppressor SRAE2-BS activity in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D) with IC50 of 9.0,
6.8, and 1.1 μM, respectively. Our findings clearly
show that our SRAE2-BS can be a very useful and
simple tool to quickly validate SMs, antibodies, and
peptides disrupting RBD-ACE2 PPI for anti-COVID19 therapy.
One character of coronavirus is the high frequency
of mutations during spreading. Although the mutation
rate for SARS-CoV-2 is not very high, many mutations
have been detected in patients all over the world. However, since there is no system for rapid analysis of the-

se mutations, how these mutations affect their binding
to ACE2 is largely unknown. By taking the advantage
of our newly constructed SRAE2-BS, we analyzed
some of the RBD mutants detected in COVID-19 patients worldwide24-29. Except for RBD-G476S mutant,
which is not stable in cells, compared to RBD-WT,
western blot analysis indicates that the expression levels of RBD mutants are similar (Fig. 4A). When the
same amounts of Sm-ACE2-His protein lysates were
mixed with those of WT or each mutant RBD, RBDL452A and RBD-T572I have similar affinity to SmACE2 to RBD-WT, whereas A474V, G476S, and
F490L mutants in RBD significantly reduce its ability
to bind to ACE2 (Fig. 4B). Most interestingly, compared to WT RBD, V367F, L452R and Q493A RBD
mutants obtained 3-5-fold increase in their bindings to
ACE2 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that some of the RBD mutants indeed enhance the binding of virus to its receptor, therefore, probably resulting in higher entrance
into cells and infectibility. Consistent to our findings,

SARS-CoV-2 with V367F or L452R mutation was indeed shown to have enhanced entrance into cells,
whereas virus with G476S, A475V or F490L mutations
have reduced entrance into cells28. Our findings provide strong evidence that our SRAE2-BS is a surrogate
assay for evaluating the ability of SARS-CoV-2 RBD

mutants on ACE2 binding and virus infectibility. We
next tested whether the mutants with enhanced binding
to ACE2 are also sensitive to antibody suppression. As
shown in Fig. 4C, although the binding of V367F and
L453R mutants to ACE2 are still significantly

suppressed by VHH72 at the same levels as WT RBD, whereas Q493A mutant is relatively insensitive to antibody suppression (Fig. 4C). We also tested whether the most potent peptide disrupting RBD-ACE2 PPI, RBD-P3, is able to
suppress mutant RBD activity (Fig. 3D). Significantly, RBD-P3 can suppress the interaction of ACE2 with both WT
and mutants at similar IC50 (Fig. 4D). As a control, the RBD-P3 peptide has little effect on LATS kinase biosensor,
Sm-YAP/LgTEAD (Fig. 4D), suggesting that the effect of RBD-P3 on RBD:ACE2 PPI is specific. Together, these
findings clearly suggest that our SRAE2-BS is a very useful tool for biochemical analysis of virus RBD mutants and
their sensitivity to drug treatments.
Finally, we also used our biosensor to test whether it can evaluate the ability of antibodies in sera of convalescent
COVID-19 patients in blocking RBD:ACE2 PPI. Since unknown molecules existing in sera of both healthy persons
and COVID-19 patients interfere our biosensor analysis, we were unable to evaluate our biosensor using serum samples (data not shown). Further optimization for assay procedures and conditions, i.e., using affinity chromatography to
extract antibodies of interest from the sample matrix, is required for future application of this biosensor for detecting
the ability of antibodies produced in COVID19 patients in suppressing RBD-ACE2 PPIs.
CONCLUSION
In this study, we have developed an ultrasensitive, simple, rapid biochemical biosensor tool to analyze the interaction of virus RBD and human ACE2 both in living cells and in vitro. It will have significant implications and applications in both basic research on SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 biology and COVID-19 clinical diagnosis and therapeutic drug
discovery.
