Abstract:

The interactions between antibodies, SARS-CoV-2 and immune cells contribute to the pathogenesis
of COVID-19 and protective immunity. To understand the differences between antibody responses
in mild versus severe cases of COVID-19, we analyzed the B cell responses in patients 1.5 months
post SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe and not mild infection correlated with high titers of IgG against
Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that were capable of viral inhibition. B cell receptor (BCR)
sequencing revealed two VH genes, VH3-38 and VH3-53, that were enriched during severe
infection. Of the 22 antibodies cloned from two severe donors, six exhibited potent neutralization
against live SARS-CoV-2, and inhibited syncytia formation. Using peptide libraries, competition
ELISA and RBD mutagenesis, we mapped the epitopes of the neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to
three different sites on the Spike.

Finally, we used combinations of nAbs targeting different

immune-sites to efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of 49 healthy BCR repertoires
revealed that the nAbs germline VHJH precursors comprise up to 2.7% of all VHJHs.

We

demonstrate that severe COVID-19 is associated with unique BCR signatures and multi-clonal
neutralizing responses that are relatively frequent in the population. Moreover, our data support the
use of combination antibody therapy to prevent and treat COVID-19.

Introduction:
The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the newly emerged SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2) and has incomparable public health, economic, and social consequences1,2. COVID-19
patients typically produce SARS-CoV-2 antibodies3, and these antibodies can be protective in small
animal models4 and in human cell lines, thus supporting SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based vaccine
initiatives.

Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) hold great therapeutic potential and have proven

efficacious for treatment of viral infections such as RSV5, Ebola6,7, Zika8, and HIV-19-11. nAbs have
been isolated from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors as early as 20 days post infection, exhibiting
low clonal expansion and small numbers of somatic hyper mutations4,12-18. However, while it is now
agreed that nAbs are produced following SARS-CoV-2 infection, how they affect the progression of
the disease remains unclear. Additionally, the effects of such antibody responses on subsequent
viral exposure and their ability to prevent re-infection are still not understood.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 varies clinically from asymptomatic in some infected individuals
to a severe disease associated with morbidity and mortality in others19,20. The development of an
effective antiviral antibody response may limit viral dissemination, thereby preventing a severe
disease. An alternative possibility is that severe disease is prevented by T cell-mediated immunity
or innate effector mechanisms which independently of B cells restrict viral replication and disease
progression. To assess the clinical profile associated with effective antibody responses following
SARS-CoV-2 infection, we recruited 18 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals 6 weeks post infection.
Eight out of the 18 donors had been hospitalized due to severe COVID-19 (termed “Severe”), while
the remaining 10 donors had experienced mild or no symptoms (termed “Mild”). The intention of the
present study was to comprehensively analyze the cellular, molecular, and functional aspects of the
antibody responses in Severe versus Mild SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors in order to understand
the potential roles for antibodies in COVID-19. Our conclusion is that severe, and not mild infection,
is correlated with robust SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. Furthermore, we isolated 6 neutralizing
antibodies from two severely affected donors and characterized their binding mechanisms by

peptide libraries, computational methods and mutagenesis while examining their anti-viral efficacy
alone and in combination against live SARS-CoV-2.

Results:
Severe COVID-19 disease is accompanied by stronger IgG responses compared to mild
To characterize the antibody repertoire in COVID-19 convalescent donors, we examined B
cell responses from 18 donors (Supplementary Table 1). Based on clinical information, the donors
were divided into two groups; 8 donors had experienced severe disease manifestations following
SARS-CoV-2 infection with >1 week of high fever (above 38.5 °C), and pneumonia that required
hospitalization. These donors were defined as Severe. The remaining 10 donors were largely
asymptomatic following SARS-CoV-2 infection, or had reported only mild symptoms such as loss of
taste and/or smell, fatigue, or fever lasting 2 for days or less. These donors were defined as Mild.
We first asked whether the Mild donors had developed higher antibody plasma responses towards
the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD, produced in house, Supplementary
Figure 1). Mild donors had significantly less anti-RBD IgG than Severe donors (p = 0.0008, Figure
1a, Supplementary Figure 2a), while no differences were observed between Mild and Severe
groups for anti-RBD IgM and IgA (Figure 1b and c, Supplementary Figure 2b and c). Moreover,
ELISA revealed that, plasma from Mild donors had significantly weaker ability to inhibit RBD binding
to a soluble angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, produced in house, Supplementary Figure 1)
compared to plasma from the Severe donors’ group (p < 0.0001, Figure 1d, and Supplementary
Figure 2d). As expected, the levels of anti-RBD IgG, but not IgM or IgA, were directly correlated
with the ability of the plasma to inhibit RBD:ACE2 binding (r2 = 0.9018, p < 0.0001, Figure 1e-g).
Pre-existing antibody responses against related respiratory viruses were previously reported to
improve the outcomes of a SARS-CoV-2 infection21. We, however, did not observe differences
between the Mild and Severe groups in their IgG titers against the closely related seasonal beta
Coronaviruses OC43 and 229E, as well as in IgG titers against Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Herpes
Simplex Virus 1 (HSV1) (Supplementary Figure 3).

We therefore conclude that, compared to

Severe donors, Mild donors have lower titers of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and a decreased ability to inhibit
RBD:ACE2 binding, while no difference in IgG directed against beta Coronaviruses OC43 and
229E.

Severe Covid-19 patients exhibit distinct BCR signatures
To compare B cell responses in Mild versus Severe donors at the molecular level, we
performed total B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing using a single cell 10x platform on seven Mild
donors (CoV03, CoV04, CoV05, CoV07 CoV10, CoV11, and CoV14, Figure 2a), and six Severe
donors (CoV01, CoV02, CoV09, CoV12 CoV13, and CoV16).

Insufficient cell amounts were

available for analysis from donors CoV08, CoV17, CoV15, and CoV18, and donor CoV06 was
excluded due to clinical reasons. When comparing the BCR dataset from 13 COVID-19 donors
(Mild and Severe donors) to two additional COVID-19 unexposed BCR datasets (7 BCR repertoires
from total B cells, and 42 BCR repertoires from naïve B cells), 6 VHJH combinations were overrepresented, and 3 VHJH combinations were under-represented in COVID-19 samples (marked in
green and red, respectively, Figure 2b). Next, we compared the BCR sequences between Mild and
Severe COVID-19 donors. Mild COVID-19 donors had significantly lower B cell lineage overlap
compared to the B cell lineage overlap within the Severe group (55 shared B cell clones in Mild,
compared to 96 shared B cell clones in Severe, Figure 2c). Two VH genes (VH3-38 (p = 0.008) and
VH3-53 (p = 0.006)) were significantly over-expressed in the Severe group when compared to Mild
(Figure 2d and e). Overall these results indicate that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated
with greater B cell clonal expansion and enrichment of VH3-38 and VH3-53.

6 mAbs from two donors CoV01 and CoV02 effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2
While the frequencies of anti-RBD B cells were not statistically significantly different between
the two groups, Mild donors display on average lower frequencies of anti-RBD B cells compared to
Severe donors (Figure 3b, and Supplementary Figure 4). Taken together with the plasma and the
BCR-seq profiling, this suggests that higher B cell responses are associated with severe, and not
mild, SARS-CoV-2 infection. We therefore focused on the Severe group of COVID-19 convalescent

donors. To investigate antibody responses in the Severe group, we used single B cell sorting with
SARS-CoV-2 RBD as a bait to derive monoclonal antibodies for analysis. We selected two donors
CoV01 and CoV02, a married couple, who were amongst the first 10 documented COVID-19 cases
in Israel (in September 2020, there are 192,579 positive cases in Israel). CoV01 infected CoV02
following a visit to Italy, as well as two of their three children. Both donors were hospitalized due to
severe pneumonia and prolonged high fever.

While both donors had strong anti-RBD IgG

responses in ELISA (Figure 1a), CoV01 had a lower frequency of anti-RBD B cells compared to
CoV02, suggesting that the antibodies in his plasma originated mostly in bone marrow-derived
Plasma cells (Figure 3b).

Using single B cell sorting and Sanger sequencing as previously

described9,22 we were able to sequence a total of 35 and 118 RBD-specific paired heavy and light
chains from memory B cells of CoV01 and CoV02, respectively (Figure 3c).

The two donors

exhibited divergent B cell responses. While 19.5% of the sequences extracted from donor CoV02
comprised 8 clonally related families, the sequences of donor CoV01 showed no clonality, possibly
due to a lower number of anti-RBD B cells (Figure 3b). The degree of somatic hypermutations were
higher in CoV01, while the sequences from CoV02 were similar to germline (Figure 3d). The
CDRH3 lengths of the sequences were similar to each other (Figure 3e). We generated 9 and 13
monoclonal antibodies from donors CoV01 and CoV02, respectively (Supplementary Table 2).
Eight of these mAbs (3 from CoV01 and 5 from CoV02) bound SARS CoV-2 RBD and Spike trimer
protein in ELISA (Figure 3f, Supplementary Figure 5a and b).

mAb TAU-1109 exhibited 40%

competition with the previously described mAb CR302223, which recognizes a non-ACE2 binding
site (non-ACE2bs, Figure 3g)24. mAbs TAU-1145, TAU-2189, TAU-2230, and TAU-2303 inhibited
RBD binding to both soluble ACE2 by ELISA (Figure 3h), and to human ACE2 (hACE2) expressing
cells (Figure 3i, Supplementary Figure 6).

We next asked whether the mAbs have neutralizing activity. We first used lentivirus-based
GFP-reporter pseudo-viruses that present SARS-CoV-2 Spike on their membrane to infect hACE2expressing HEK-293 cells (Supplementary Figure 7). All the RBD and Spike-binding mAbs had
some neutralizing activity in the pseudo-viral assay with IC50 ranging between 0.04 µg/mL to 3.8

µg/mL (Figure 4a). We then tested the neutralizing activity of the mAbs against live SARS-CoV-2.
Vero E6 cells were infected with live SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of mAbs, and after 48 h virus
was detected using fluorescently labeled anti-nucleocapsid antibody. Six of the nine mAbs that
neutralized the pseudo-typed virus, also neutralized live virus (TAU-1109, -2212, -2189, -2230, 2310, and -2303, Figure 4b and c, Supplementary Figure 8). To further screen for neutralizing
activity of these mAbs, the viability of the cells was tracked by live cell imaging for three days to
examine the effects of mAb titrations on virus-induced cell death. The same mAbs (TAU-1109, 2212, -2189, -2230, -2310, and -2303) dramatically decreased the number of dead cells when used
at concentrations ranging from 1 - 100 µg/mL (Figure 4d, Supplementary Figure 9), and two of the
mAbs, TAU-2212 and TAU-2230 inhibited syncytia formation (Figure 4e and f). Interestingly, mAb
TAU-2212 demonstrated impressive neutralizing ability in all three assays (pseudo-virus, live virus
and syncytia formation) despite having no detectable binding to either SARS-CoV-2 RBD or the
Spike trimer by ELISA (Figures 3f). Using fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry, we confirmed
the binding of TAU-2212 to the viral Spike when the trimer was transiently expressed on the surface
of HEK-293 cells (Figure 4g, Supplementary Figure 10). It is known that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike
protein transitions rapidly between an open and a closed state17, suggesting that TAU-2212 may be
targeting a conformation-dependent epitope, or an epitope that involves more than one subunit.

G446 is a key residue in the binding of ACE2bs nAbs
We sought to further explore the epitope of ACE2bs neutralizing mAbs (ACE2bs nAbs) on
RBD. We focused on nAb TAU-2230 that exhibited over 80% blockade of ACE2:RBD interaction in
ELISA (Figure 3h). To map the epitope of this nAb on the surface of RBD we used phage-displayed
random peptide libraries and the Mapitope algorithm25. In this method, one maps linear affinity
selected peptides pulled from a random peptide library onto the 3-D atomic coordinates of the
antigen to get an output of 2-3 epitope candidates26. A total of 16 peptides were isolated with TAU2230 (Figure 5a), and these were used as input for Mapitope to generate epitope prediction. Three
epitope candidates were predicted, Clusters A-C, one of which, Cluster B, overlapped with the
ACE2bs (Supplementary Figure 11).

Cluster B had 4 shared contact residues with ACE2bs27

(Figure 5b). To identify key residues for TAU-2230 recognition, we introduced a panel of point
mutations in RBD in the TAU-2230 predicted epitope, as well as outside the predicted epitope, as
control. We then tested the binding of other RBD-binding mAbs, as well as ACE2, to the generated
RBD mutants. Mutation of a single residue G446ARBD, that was in the core of predicted TAU-2230
epitope, abolished completely the binding of TAU-2230, as well as the binding of other ACE2bs
nAbs, TAU-2189 and 1145 (Figure 5c and d). Mutating residues T500DRBD and G496ARBD reduced
the binding of ACE2, but did not affect TAU-2230, suggesting that TAU-2230 binding to these
residues might be through interaction with the backbone atoms rather than the sidechains (Figure
5c). Antibody TAU-1109 that binds the RBD strongly, and binds outside the ACE2bs (does not
compete with ACE2 for binding) served as a positive control indicating that the conformation of the
mutated RBD proteins was intact. Based on these computational and mutagenesis analyses we
conclude that residue G446 is central in the recognition of RBD by ACE2bs nAbs.

Combinations of nAbs directed against different sites effectively block virus spread
Combination therapies have now become the paradigm for antiviral therapy and to avoid
viral escape mutants2,28.

We therefore investigated whether combinations of our nAbs could

synergistically block viral infection and viral spread. The nAbs we isolated are directed against at
least three different sites on the virus; ACE2bs (TAU-2230, -2189, -1145, and -2303), CR3022proximal (TAU-1109), and an unknown conformational epitope (TAU-2212). Combining nAbs TAU2212 and TAU-1109 at a concentration of 1 µg/mL, blocked live SARS-CoV-2 infection by 95%,
suggesting a synergistic effect between these nAbs (Figure 6a, top panel, red column). We then
combined either TAU-2212 or TAU-1109 with one of the four ACE2bs nAbs, at concentrations of 1
or 10 µg/mL, and measured the number of dead cells over time. At 10 µg/mL viral inhibition was
achieved when TAU-1109 was combined with TAU-2303 (Figure 6b, bottom left panel), or when
TAU-2212 was combined with any of the ACE2bs nAbs (Figure 6b, right panel).

The triple

combination at 10 µg/mL (TAU-2212, -1109 and ACE2bs nAb) blocked 99% of virus-induced cell
death (Figure 6c, bottom panel). We conclude that combining TAU-2212 with either ACE2bs nAbs
or with TAU-1109 is an extremely potent formula for live SARS-CoV-2 inhibition.

The precursors of nAbs are frequent in the BCR repertoire
The nAbs described in this study were elicited naturally following infection and therefore
represent a desired response following vaccination. We therefore examined the frequency of these
nAbs in the total and naïve BCR repertoires. We were able to identify the VHJH combinations that
give rise to these nAbs in 7 COVID-19 unexposed BCR repertoires, as well as in 42 COVID-19
unexposed BCR repertoires comprised of only naïve B cells. Moreover, the VHJH combinations for
nAbs TAU-1145, -2212, -2230, -2189, and -2310 were present within the 30 most frequent VHJH
combinations. Our data indicates that SARS-CoV-2 neutralization can be achieved in many ways
and that the germline gene combinations that give rise to anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAbs are relatively
frequent in the healthy BCR repertoire. Therefore, given enough antigenic stimulation (which is the
case during severe COVID-19), these nAbs can be produced by the majority of individuals (Figure
7).

Discussion:
The link between COVID-19 clinical manifestations and SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses is
still not clear. While our study focused on only 18 donors, we saw that all patients exhibiting
symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection developed similarly high levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, in contrast
to donors with milder symptoms, who exhibited a wide range of responses, ranging from high to
non-detectable.

Although this indicates that high titers of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are not

responsible for lack of COVID-19 symptoms, these antibodies and memory B cells developing
during severe disease may prevent future re-infection.

In agreement with other studies, the antibodies sequenced from memory B cells of the
donors we investigated demonstrated a relatively low degree of somatic hyper mutations and clonal
expansion12,29. Within the convalescent donors, Severe donors had higher level of shared B cell
closed compared to Mild donors, likely due to increased antigenic stimulation and/or prolonged

viremia to drive expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells. Moreover, the Severe donors had an
increased representation of VH3-38 and VH3-53 (VH3-53 was previously described as dominant in
responses against SARS-CoV-215,17,30). However, the nAbs we isolated from CoV01 and CoV02
donors did not originate from these VHs. Both donors exhibited neutralizing activity that was multiclonal, i.e., comprised of several neutralizing clones targeting different sites on the Spike. Both
donors produced antibodies against the ACE2bs. The contact residues of mAb TAU-2230 were
predicted to partially overlap with ACE2bs, using similar tools to the ones we used to map the
epitope of the SARS mAb 80R31 in 2006. This highlights the ACE2bs as a major neutralizing
determinant on the different Coronaviruses that is targeted by antibodies elicited during infection in
humans. Additional two groups of neutralizing determinants are targeted by nAbs TAU-1109 and
TAU-2212. These nAbs bind outside the ACE2bs and their epitopes, that are still to be determined,
may constitute new sites of vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2, as well as targets for vaccines.

The nAbs we isolated did not require substantial affinity maturation, as evidenced from the
low numbers of somatic hypermutations. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis of 7 + 42 uninfected BCR
repertoires revealed that the precursors that give rise to these nAbs are abundant in the naïve
population. Somewhat counterintuitively, many of the mild donors in our cohort did not develop antiRBD IgGs that were able to inhibit RBD:ACE2 interaction (CoV05, -06, -07, -11, -14, and -18). This
suggests that while most individuals have SARS-CoV-2 nAb precursors in their BCR repertoires, a
single dose vaccine may not be sufficient to elicit protective anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity.

This is the first demonstration that combinations of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAbs can
effectively block the spread of live SARS-CoV-2.

In this context, combinations of nAbs were

previously shown to prevent the selection of HIV-1 escape mutants32,33. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has
been reported to mutate in culture in the presence of nAbs34. The combinations examined in our
study can be further tested in clinical settings as a useful means of prevention and therapy of
COVID-19.

Ethics statement
All COVID-19 convalescent donors, between the ages 25 and 65 recruited for this study
provided a written informed consent prior to participating in this study. All donors tested positive in
at least two separate RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 infection. A sample of 150 mL whole blood
was collected 1.5 months post SARS-CoV-2 infection, after two consecutive negative RT-PCR
results. Tel Aviv University Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved all studies involving patient
enrollment, sample collection, and clinical follow-up (protocol number 0001255-1). Donors CoV01, 02, -03, -04, -05, -06, -07, 08, -12, -13, and -18 were followed by Ichilov Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical
Center (Helsinki approval number 0190-20-TLV), while donors CoV09, -10, -11, -14, -15, -16, and 17 were followed and recruited by Kaplan Medical Center in Rehovot (protocol number 0049-20KMC).

Cloning, expression, and purification of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the extra-cellular human
ACE2 for ELISA and FACS
Codon optimized sequences encoding the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2 were downloaded
from the NCBI data base, synthesized by Syntezza-Israel, and cloned into the pcDNA 3.1
mammalian expression vector.

Each construct contained an N-terminal growth factor receptor

signal peptide [MKAPAVLAPGILVLLFTLVQRSNG] and two C-terminal tags - a hexa-histidine tag
(HHHHHH, “His-tag”) for downstream protein purification and a site-specific biotinylation tag
(GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE, AviTag).

Each construct was individually used to transiently transfect

Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) using the ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Seven days post transfection, the cell supernatant was collected,
filtered (0.22 µm), and incubated with Ni2+-NTA agarose beads (GE Life Sciences) for 2 h at room
temperature (RT). Proteins were eluted by 250 mM imidazole, buffer-exchanged to PBS x1, and
then aliquoted and stored at -80°C. The RBD protein was biotinylated with the BirA biotin-protein
ligase kit (Avidity LLC, Colorado, USA) using the manufacturer’s protocol.

Isolation of plasma and PBMCs from whole blood samples
Plasma was isolated from 10 mL of each sample and the rest was used for isolation of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). For plasma separation, the sample was left in the
collection tube (BD Vacutainer® blood collection tubes, Becton, Dickinson and Company) in an
upright position for 2 h followed by centrifugation at 1500 g for 15 min. The upper layer containing
the plasma was collected, aliquoted, and stored at -20 °C. PBMCs were isolated by diluting whole
blood sample 3-fold with RPMI 1640 medium (Biological Industries Israel Beit-Haemek) and loading
the material on Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Life Sciences) at a ratio of 1.8 : 1 for phase separation
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

The lymphocyte containing buffy coat layer was

transferred to a new vial, washed, resuspended in fetal bovine serum (FBS) containing 10% DMSO,
and stored in liquid nitrogen.

Plasma and mAb ELISA
For plasma ELISA, high-binding 96 well ELISA plates (Corning #9018) were coated with 1
µg/mL RBD in PBS x1 overnight at 4 °C. The following day, the coating was discarded, the wells
were washed with “washing buffer” containing PBS x1 0.05% Tween20, and the plates were
blocked for 2 h at RT with 200 µL of “blocking buffer” containing PBS x1 3% BSA (MP Biomedicals)
20mM EDTA and 0.05% Tween20 (Sigma). Plasma samples were diluted 2-fold in blocking buffer
starting from 1:100 with seven consecutive dilutions, and incubated for 1 h at RT. Plates were then
washed 3 times with washing buffer before adding secondary anti-IgG, or -IgM (Jackson
ImmmunoResearch 109-035-088 & 109-035-129) or anti-IgA (abcam ab97215) antibodies
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) diluted 1:5000 in blocking buffer, and incubated for 45
min at RT. Following four additional washes, 100 µL of TMB/E (Millipore) was added to each well
and the absorbance at 650 nm was read after 20 min (BioTek 800 TS). Positive and negative
controls were added to each plate. For mAb ELISA, high binding 96 well ELISA plates were coated
with 1 µg/mL RBD, washed and blocked as described above. Antibodies were added at starting
concentration of 10 µg/mL with nine additional 4-fold dilutions in PBS x1, and incubated for 1 hour at

RT. Plates were then washed 3 times with washing buffer before adding secondary anti-IgG HRPconjugated as described above. After four additional washes, 100 µL of TMB/E (Millipore) was
added to each well and the absorbance at 650 nm was read after 20 min. For ACE2:RBD inhibition
ELISA, high-binding 96 well plates were coated with 2 µg/mL human ACE2 in PBS x1 overnight at 4
°C. The next day, plates were washed and blocked with blocking buffer for 2 h at RT. Concurrently,
biotinylated RBD was mixed with the 4-fold serial dilutions of plasma or mAbs.

The RBD-

plasma/mAb mix was then applied to the ACE2 coated plates and incubated for 30 min.
Biotinylated RBD was detected via streptavidin conjugated to HRP (Jackson ImmmunoResearch
016-030-084).

For CR3022 competition, ELISA plates were coated with 0.5 µg/mL RBD as described, and
then washed and blocked. Serial dilutions of each mAb were added and the plates were incubated
for 30 min. Next, biotinylated CR3022 at a concentration of 0.1 µg/mL was added to each well and
incubated for an additional 15 min. The plates were then washed and incubated with streptavidinHRP for 45 min. The plates were then washed and the signal detected as described above.

ELISA to validate affinity-selected phages binding to TAU-2230 mAb was carried out as
follows: High-binding 96 well ELISA plates (Corning #3590) were coated with 2 µg/mL mAb TAU2230 overnight at 4°C. The following day, the wells were blocked for 1 h at RT with blocking
solution (5% skim milk in TBS x1). After washing once with TBS x1 0.05% Tween 20, purified
phages diluted in blocking solution were applied to each well, starting from 4 x 108 phages per well
to give a total of five consecutive 3-fold dilutions. The plates were incubated for 1 h at RT, then
washed 3 times with wash buffer, and incubated with rabbit anti-m13 polyclonal sera at a dilution of
1:5000 in blocking solution for 1 h at RT. After 3 washes, the plates were incubated at RT with a
secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody (Jackson, West Grove, PA) at a dilution of 1:2500 in
blocking solution for 45 min. The wells were then washed 3 times wash buffer and once with TBS

Absorbance was measured as described.

scRNA-seq library construction and BCR-seq data analysis
B cells were isolated from frozen PBMCs by using anti-CD19 immunomagnetic beads
according to the manufacturer's protocol (CD19 Microbeads, human, Miltenyi Biotec). Purified B
cells were eluted in PBS x1 containing 0.5% v/v Fetal bovine serum (FBS)) and 2 mM EDTA. Cells
were centrifuged for 10 min at 300 x g and resuspended in PBS x1 containing 0.04% w/v BSA and
counted. Up to 16,600 B cells were loaded on a 10x Chromium Next GEM Chip G Kit and library
synthesized according to the 10x Chromium Next GEM Single Cell V(D)J Reagent Kits v1.1
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10x Genomics). BCR CDR3 sequences were enriched
using the human V(D)J B cell enrichment kit (10x Genomics).

Libraries were sequenced by

Genewiz on a NovaSeq 6000 System using the S4 2x 150 kit (Illumina). Raw read alignment and
contig assembly were performed using Cellranger V(D)J (10x Genomics, version 3.1.0), with the
default compatible human reference (refdata-cellranger-vdj-GRCh38-alts-ensembl-3.1.0). Contigs
were aligned to human IG loci using igBLAST-1.16.036, and clones were assigned based on nonexact matching of the heavy chain sequence, using the Immcantation framework.

Briefly, the

normalized Hamming distance from each cell to its nearest neighbor was calculated using the
Shazam R package (version 1.0.0). Based on the distribution of these distances, the cutoff to
define two contigs as belonging to a single clone was set to 0.11. Clones were then assigned using
the DefineClones command from the Change-O toolkit (version 1.0.0 2020.05.06 of the algorithm
described by Gupta et al. 37).

Flow cytometry single B cell sorting and sequencing
PBMCs were rapidly thawed at 37 °C and washed in 50 mL RPMI 1640 medium, followed by
B cell enrichment using anti-CD19 magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-050-301) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The enriched B cells were resuspended in 1 % BSA in PBS x1 and 2 mM

EDTA and stained with anti-CD19-FITC (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-113-645), anti-igG-APC (Miltenyi
Biotec, 130-119-772), anti-CD27-Brilliant Violet 605 (BioLegend, 302830), anti-CD38-PerCP
(BioLegend, 356614), followed by labeled RBD via streptavidin-PE (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-106-790)
and streptavidin-APC (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-106-792). Single CD19+IgG+RBD+ cells were sorted into
a 96 well plate containing 4 µL lysis buffer (12 units of RNasin Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega,
N2511), 10 mM DTT and PBS x0.5) per well using a FACSAria III sorter (Becton Dickinson). The
plates were stored in dry ice before proceeding to RNA reverse transcription and PCR DNA
amplification. For this purpose, the lysed cells were thawed on ice and the Ig genes were amplified
by RT-PCR as previously described9,22,38. Briefly, cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer
primers (Invitrogen, 48190011), and SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, 18080085).
Antibody sequences corresponding to the gamma, kappa, and lambda chains were amplified by
nested PCR as previously described22,38. The first round of PCR ran at 94 °C for 7 min, 50 cycles of
94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C (gamma) 50 °C (kappa) or 58 °C (lambda) for 20 s, and 72 °C for 40 s. The
second round of PCR ran at similar conditions but the number of cycles was reduced to 40 and the
annealing temperature of the gamma and lambda chains was slightly raised to 56°C and 60°C
respectively.

Second round PCR products were purified, sequenced, and annotated with

IgBLAST36. First round PCR products were used as a template for additional amplification with
specific 5’ V and 3’ J primers containing restriction sites for subsequent cloning into Ig expression
vectors.

PCR products were purified (MACHEREY-NAGEL, 740609.250), digested with the

appropriate restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs), and ligated (New England Biolabs,
M0202L) into the corresponding expression vectors for IgG, IgK, or IgL.

Antibody production
Cloned mAb vectors for IgG1 heavy chain and Kappa or Lambda light chains were cotransfected at a ratio of 1:3 (H:K/L) into Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) using the
ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Seven days post transfection,
the cell supernatant was collected, filtered (0.22 µm) and incubated with protein A coated agarose

beads (GE Life Sciences, 17519901) for 2 h at RT.

The beads were then loaded onto

chromatography columns, washed, and eluted using 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 3.0) into 1 M
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Antibodies were buffer exchanged to PBS x1, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C.

Antibody inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to hACE2-expressing cells
PE conjugated, biotinylated RBD was incubated with each mAb for 20 min at 4 °C, and then
with hACE2-expressing mouse lung cells for 20 min at 4 °C.

The cells were analyzed using

CytoFLEX S4 (Beckman Coulter) and the PE florescence was recorded.

Affinity selection of TAU-2230 specific peptides
Biopanning protocol was performed as previously described 26. Briefly, approximately 1x1011
phages from the random-peptide library were mixed with 2 µg TAU-2230 mAb in TBS x1 3% BSA
solution (complete to 100 µL) in 0.5 mL vials (AXYGEN, PCR tubes, PCR-05-C), and incubated for
1 h at RT. Next, 30 µL of protein G coated magnetic beads (Invitrogen, DynabeadsTM Protein G)
were added and the mix was incubated for additional 30 min on a rotating mixer at RT. The vials
were then placed on a magnetic stand (Promega, MagneSphere® Technology Magnetic Separation
Stands) for 2 min to collect the beads, and the supernatant was discarded.

The beads were

washed 3 times with 200 µL TBS x1 0.5% TWEEN20, and the bound phages were eluted twice with
105 µL of elution buffer (0.1N HCl pH 2.2, 1 mg/mL BSA) for 10 min, followed by addition of 19 µL
of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 9.1. A total of three rounds of biopanning were carried out for each screen. In
order to confirm binding to affinity-selected phages, monoclonal phages were produced in E. coli
DH5αF, re-suspended in TBS x1 0.5% TWEEN20, quantified and used in confirmatory dot blot
analyses.

Pseudo-particle preparation and neutralization assays
SARS-CoV-2-Spike pseudo-particles were obtained by co-transfection of Expi293F cells
with pCMV delta R8.2, pLenti-GFP (Genecopoeia), and pCDNA3.1 SΔC19 (ThermoFisher

Scientific) at a ratio of 1:2:1, respectively, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The

supernatant was harvested 72 h post transfection, centrifuged at 1500xg for 10min to remove
cell debris, and passed through a 0.45 μm filter (LIFEGENE, Israel). The pseudo-particle-containing
supernatant was then concentrated to 5% of its original volume using an Amicon Ultra with a 100
KDa cutoff at 16 °C (Merck Millipore).

HEK-293 cells stably expressing hACE2 were seeded into 0.1 % Gelatin-coated 96-well
plates (Greiner) at an initial density of 0.75 x 105 cells per well. The following day, concentrated
pseudo-particles were incubated with serial dilutions of antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C and then added
to the 96 well pre-seeded plates. After 48 h, the cell medium was replaced with fresh DMEM
medium excluding Phenol Red, and 24 h later, the 96-well plates were imaged by the IncuCyte
ZOOM system (Essen BioScience). Cells were imaged with a 10x objective using the default
IncuCyte software settings, which were used to calculate number of GFP-positive cells from four
488 nm-channel images in each well (data for each antibody concentration were collected in
triplicate). The numbers of GFP-positive cells were normalized and converted to a neutralization
percentage. IC50 and IC80 were calculated by GraphPad Prism software fitting to a non-linear
regression model.

SARS-CoV-2 infection
SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources) was propagated using Vero E6
(ATCC) cells and infectious units quantified by plaque assay. For antibody neutralization assays,
104 Vero E6 cells were seeded in wells of a 96-well plate and incubated overnight in DMEM 10%
FBS with penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C 5% CO2. The following day, titrations of mAbs were
incubated with 104 PFU for 1 h in DMEM 10% FBS at room temperature, then added to Vero E6
cells for up to 48 h. Infection was measured by tracking virus-induced cell death of Vero E6 cells
and by intracellular staining for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, described below.

Virus titers were determined by plaque assays on Vero E6 monolayers. Serial dilutions of
virus stocks in DMEM (Corning, #10-014-CV) were added to Vero E6 monolayers on 12-well plates
and incubated 1 h at 37 °C with rocking every 10-15 min. Virus was removed, and cells were
subsequently overlaid with a 1:1 mixture of 1.2% agarose (ThermoFisher Scientific, #16500-100)
and supplemented 2x MEM (2x MEM (ThermoFisher Scientific #11935046) plus 8% FBS, 2x nonessential amino acids, 2x L-glutamine, and 1.5x sodium bicarbonate). Plates were incubated at 37
°C in 5% CO2 for 48 h and fixed with a mixture of 10% formaldehyde and 2% methanol (v/v in PBS)
for 24 h. Agarose overlays were removed, and the monolayer was washed once with PBS x1 and
stained with 0.025% Crystal Violet prepared in 2% ethanol.

After 15 min, Crystal Violet was

removed, and plaques were counted to determine the virus titers. Plaque assays were performed
and counted by a blinded experimenter. Plaque assays were counted and recorded by a blinded
observer.

All work with SARS-CoV-2 was conducted in Biosafety Level-3 conditions at the

University of California San Diego following the guidelines approved by the Institutional Biosafety
Committees.

Immunofluorescence imaging and analysis
For viral nucleocapsid detection in Vero E6 cells by immunofluorescence, cells were washed
twice with PBS x1 and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at RT. Fixed cells were washed with
PBS x1 and permeabilized for immunofluorescence using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm according to the
manufacturer’s protocol for fixed cells and stained for SARS-CoV-2 with a primary Nucleocapsid
antibody (GeneTex GTX135357) conjugated to AF594 (ThermoFisher A20185) and nuclei
counterstained with Hoechst. Eight images per well were obtained using a Nikon Ti2-E microscope
equipped with a Spectra III light engine (Lumencor), appropriate filter cubes (Semrock), and a Qi-2
camera. For images acquired with the Nikon Ti2-E, analysis was performed using custom-scripted
code for the Fiji distribution of ImageJ (PMID 22743772) and the DeepLearning plugin StarDist
(Schmidt et al, 2012 – see below) as follows. Channels were separated and the Hoechst-stained
nuclei were segmented using StarDist to generate individual masks for each nucleus. The AF594
channel (Nucleocapsid) was selected by removing background with a rolling ball of 50 pixels. A

median filter (sigma=10) was applied to facilitate thresholding of AF594 signal. The resulting image
was used to generate a mask representing all positive stain. Positive nuclei were selected by firstly
eroding the StarDist-generated nuclei mask by 2 pixels to reduce potential overlap with non-positive
stain. Binary reconstruction was then carried out between the resulting mask and the AF594 mask.
Data from all fields of view was logged and graphed with Graphpad Prism39.

Virus-induced cell death
SARS-CoV-2-triggered cell death of Vero E6 cells was monitored using an Incucyte S3.
Titrations of mAbs were incubated with 104 PFU for 1 h in DMEM 10% FBS at RT, then added to
104 confluent Vero E6 cells for up to 96 h at MOI of 1. Cell viability was monitored using 1 µg/mL
propidium iodide. Five fields of view at 10x magnification representing 33.6% well coverage were
monitored for changes in cell viability every 6 h. PI-positive cells were identified using Incucyte
software.

Cell-to-cell fusion assay:
HEK-293T cells were plated in a 6-well plate (Greiner) at an initial density of 0.5 x 106 cells
per well. In parallel, HEK-293 target cells stably expressing hACE2 were plated in a gelatin-covered
96-well plate (Greiner) at an initial density of 0.75 x 105 cell per well. After 16 h incubation, the
HEK-293T cells were transfected with 3

μg

of pCDNA3.1 plasmid encoding SARS-CoV-2-Spike

(MN908947.3) with 19 amino acid C-terminal truncation (pSΔC19), using polyethyleneimine (PEI,
Sigma Aldrich). Six hours post-transfection, the cells were washed once with complete media and
collected using a cell scraper (BIOFIL, Israel). Next, 1 x 104 cells were overlaid on the target cells in
the presence of 10 μg/mL of the appropriate antibody. The cells were incubated for 2 h, prior to
imaging by the IncuCyte ZOOM system (Essen BioScience) at hourly intervals over 12 h. The 96well plate (Greiner) was imaged with a 10x objective utilizing the default IncuCyte software
parameters, which were used to calculate the mean confluence area of single-nuclei cells from 4
bright phase images in each well. The percentage area of syncytia was calculated by subtracting
the single cell area from the total field area using the following equation:
