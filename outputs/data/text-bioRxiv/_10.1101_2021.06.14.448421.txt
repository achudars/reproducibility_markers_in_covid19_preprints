Abstract
Motivation: SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Variants of Concern (VOCs)
and Variants of Interest (VOIs) are lineages that represent a greater risk to public health, and can
be differentiated from the wildtype virus based on unique profiles of signature mutations. Wastewater
surveillance by metagenomic sequence analysis can capture signal for these variants that may not be
detected by public health testing and/or sequencing initiatives. However, because multiple viral genomes
are likely to be present in a metagenomic sample, additional analytical scrutiny of the sequencing reads
beyond variant calling can provide more confident diagnostic determinations.
Results: We have developed MMMVI to aggregate and report cases where multiple mutations are present
on a given read. These reads can be used as enhanced biomarkers to more confidently confirm the
presence of a VOC/VOI in the sample.
Availability: MMMVI is implemented in Python, and is available under the MIT licence from
https://github.com/dorbarker/voc-identify/

1 Introduction
Surveillance of wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 has proven advantageous
because it is non-invasive, can capture signal from asymptomatic and
positive cases not detected via the public health system and may be
predictive of clinical trends (Medema et al., 2020; D’Aoust et al.,
2021). Metagenomic sequencing provides a mechanism to characterize
the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 present in wastewater, and presents
a snapshot of the lineages circulating within the community. Importantly,
these data can be screened for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of
Concern (VOCs) and Variants of Interest (VOIs) based on the profile
of signature mutations observed in the sample (Hadfield et al., 2018;
Rambaut et al., 2020; Public Health England, 2021). However, a sample
may not contain the complete set of mutations corresponding to any
single VOC/VOI. This could be due to incomplete sequencing of the
genome, or indicative of the early introduction, or localized outbreak of
one or more VOCs/VOIs in the community. It is also possible to observe
signature mutations from multiple VOCs/VOIs in a single sample, and
some signature mutations (e.g., N501Y) have emerged independently
in multiple VOCs/VOIs. Thus, the criteria (i.e., the number and/or set
of specific signature mutations required) to stipulate the presence of a
VOC/VOI in a metagenomics context are not well defined.
We propose an approach that takes advantage of signature mutations
that occur in close proximity to one another in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

If we assume that a sequencing read is ultimately derived from a distinct
viral genome, then any mutations identified on that read should also be
derived from that viral genome. Therefore, the combination of signature
mutations found on a single read can be used as an enhanced biomarker
that is more sensitive than variant calling for the detection of a VOC/VOI,
but also suitable as a surrogate marker in samples where the genome is
incompletely sequenced.
Here, we present MMMVI, a command line tool that automates
the categorisation and quantification of reads based on all combinations
of signature mutations they encompass. It generates a number of
detailed reports to more confidently inform the presence of, or
differentiate between, one or more VOCs/VOIs in a sample. MMMVI is
compatible with data generated from both Illumina and Oxford Nanopore
Technologies platforms, and can be readily run both on consumer-grade
hardware and in parallel on a computer cluster.

2 Description
2.1 Data
A wastewater sample positive by RT-qPCR detection for the
B.1.1.7/N501Y.V1/Alpha SARS-CoV-2 VOC was amplified using a tiledPCR amplification method and sequenced on both the Illumina MiSeq
and Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platforms (BioProject:
PRJNA708265). Reads from each sequencing run were independently

2.2 Input
MMMVI takes three files as input: the sample in BAM format aligned to
the reference genome (Li et al., 2009), the complete reference genome
in FASTA format, and a delimited tabular text file describing signature
nucleotide mutations.

The first line in Table 1 describes substitution of C in the wildtype
by A in B.1.1.7 at reference genome position 23604 in the sense strand.
Similarly, the second line shows a three base substitution of GAT by CTA,
beginning at position 28280. The third line is a 6 base deletion relative to the
reference beginning at position 21765. On the fourth, a four base insertion
between reference positions 28262 and 28263 is indicated. All positions
are 1-based, i.e. position 1 is the first base in the reference genome. All
intervals are closed.

2.3 Mutation Identification
MMMVI makes use of pandas and pysam (https://github.com/pysamdevelopers/pysam) (McKinney et al., 2011; PySAM Developers, 2019)
for efficient processing.
Each read is compared to the set of mutations provided by the mutations
table. If a read spans all the reference positions for a given mutation, its
sequence at those positions is compared with the mutation. If the read
contains all of the substitutions or deletions described by the mutation, the
read is considered to have that mutation. Gaps in the read alignment are
considered deletions. A read may contain multiple mutations, and each
unique combination of mutations is considered a read species.

2.4 Output
All outputs are returned to the user as delimited text files, with the delimiter
optionally selectable by the user.
2.4.1 Summary Table
The summary file contains a table indicating the count of reads possessing
N mutations for each VOC/VOI, as well as the wildtype. The numerical
column headers indicate N mutations found on the read, and the left
column shows the variant names. The table values for these show the count
of reads with N mutations for each variant. The maximum mutations
per median read indicates the greatest theoretical number of mutations
for a given VOC/VOI that can fit on a single read based on the median
read length calculated for the sample. Also shown are the fraction of
signature mutations that are represented in the sample, as well the fraction
of signature mutations which are exclusive to that VOC/VOI.
2.4.2 Co-occurrence Matrices
The co-occurrence matrices show the frequencies of cases where multiple
mutations are present on a given read.
These matrices are given both as absolute counts and as relative counts.
The relative count expresses, for each pair of mutations X and Y , the count

possessing X.
2.4.3 Read Report
This report shows every sequencing read given as input and alleles present
for each VOC/VOI and the wildtype. The alleles are expressed as genomic
positions, with coordinates placed in the column or columns which
correspond to a VOC or the wildtype.
2.4.4 Read Species Report
The read species report shows every unique combination of mutations
found on a single read, as well as the positions that are mutated, the
nucleotide or INDEL present at those positions, and the number of times
a given combination was observed in the dataset.
Further, it provides a bit array for each VOC/VOI and the wildtype,
indicating at each position which variant shares the observed nucleotide
or INDEL. Finally, each combination is expressed as a proportion relative
to the number of reads spanning the relevant positions, and as a proportion
relative to the total number of reads in the dataset.

3 Conclusion
MMMVI uses a command line interface for user interaction. For ease
of automation, we also provide a Snakemake workflow for executing
MMMVI jobs (Mölder et al., 2021).
Table 3 shows the performance of MMMVI on inputs generated using
the Illumina MiSeq and Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION. We
searched for two VOCs or VOIs plus wildtype, comprising 45 variant
positions.

MMMVI facilitates detection of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in metagenomic
sequence data sourced from wastewater. Although it was designed for use
with wastewater samples, we believe this approach is applicable to other
sample types.
