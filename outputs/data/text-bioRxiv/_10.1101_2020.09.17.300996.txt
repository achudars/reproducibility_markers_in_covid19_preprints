Abstract

34

To date, the Covid-19 pandemic affected more than 18 million individuals and caused more

35

than 690, 000 deaths. Its clinical expression is pleiomorphic and severity is related to age and

36

comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. The pathophysiology of the disease relies on

37

aberrant activation of immune system and lymphopenia that has been recognized as a

38

prognosis marker. We wondered if the myeloid compartment was affected in Covid-19 and if

39

monocytes and macrophages could be infected by SARS-CoV-2. We show here that SARS-

40

CoV-2 efficiently infects monocytes and macrophages without any cytopathic effect.

41

Infection was associated with the secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10,

42

TGF-β) and the induction of a macrophagic specific transcriptional program characterized by

43

the upregulation of M2-type molecules. In addition, we found that in vitro macrophage

44

polarization did not account for the permissivity to SARS-CoV-2, since M1- and M2-type

45

macrophages were similarly infected. Finally, in a cohort of 76 Covid-19 patients ranging

46

from mild to severe clinical expression, all circulating monocyte subsets were decreased,

47

likely related to massive emigration into tissues. Monocytes from Covid-19 patients exhibited

48

decreased expression of HLA-DR and increased expression of CD163, irrespective of the

49

clinical status. Hence, SARS-CoV-2 drives circulating monocytes and macrophages inducing

50

immunoparalysis of the host for the benefit of Covid-19 disease progression.

Introduction

54

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/2019-n-

55

CoV) emerged in Wuhan (China) at the end of 2019 and caused the coronavirus disease of

56

2019 (Covid-19) pandemic in a few weeks, affecting more than 18 million people and killing

57

more than 690,000 to date (1). The disease is characterized by a strikingly heterogeneous

58

clinical presentation and prognosis. Most patients are pauci-symptomatic or have fever, cough

59

and fatigue, while a minority experience progression to an acute respiratory distress syndrome

60

or other critically severe conditions. The severity of the disease is related to underlying

61

conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart diseases or obesity (2). The

62

mechanisms of the disease remain elusive at this stage, but evidence for a prominent role of

63

the immune system is accumulating. The severity of Covid-19 pneumonia is associated with

64

lymphopenia and a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (3), which contributes to the massive

65

migration of T cells into tissues, mainly the lung as revealed by accumulation of T cells

66

within lesions (4).

67

There is evidence that myeloid cells may be involved in the pathophysiology of

68

coronavirus infection, either directly, as a targets for the virus, or indirectly, as effectors of the

69

CRS (5). Indeed, it is known from previous coronavirus outbreaks that macrophages are

70

susceptible to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 infection (6). Recently, macrophage and

71

monocyte accumulation in the alveolar lumen has been shown in a humanized mice model of

72

SARS-CoV-2 expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (7). In addition,

73

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein has been detected in lymph nodes and spleen-associated

74

CD169+ macrophages from Covid-19 patients (8). Finally, single cell RNA sequencing of

75

pulmonary tissue from Covid-19 patients revealed an expansion of interstitial macrophages

76

and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) but not of alveolar macrophages (9). However,

77

whether circulating monocytes and/or macrophages are targets of SARS-CoV-2 and whether

78

monocyte diversity is altered in Covid-19 patients require specific investigation since most

79

studies are based on this hypothesis.

80

Monocytes are innate hematopoietic cells that maintain vascular homeostasis and

81

ensure early responses to pathogens during acute infections. Three distinct human monocyte

82

subsets are described, based on the expression of CD14 and CD16 surface antigens: classical

83

CD14+CD16- monocytes, intermediate CD14+CD16+ monocytes, and non-classical CD14-

84

CD16+ monocytes (10,11). Recently, it has been shown in murine models that classical

85

monocytes are the precursors of non-classical monocytes (12). There is evidence that

86

monocyte subsets exhibit a certain degree of functional specialization. During bacterial

87

infection, classical monocytes are recruited to the sites of inflammation, where they exert

88

typical phagocytic functions and can differentiate into inflammatory dendritic cells or

89

macrophages. Non-classical monocytes crawl along vasculature and surveil the vascular tissue

90

(13). Alterations of monocyte subset frequency have been reported in infectious and

91

inflammatory diseases (10). While macrophages largely arise from monocytes in acute

92

situations such as infection, under homeostatic conditions most tissue macrophages are of

93

embryonic origin and monocytes merely renew this population (14). Consequently, the

94

mobilization of immune cells in Covid-19 might lead to macrophage populations of multiple

95

origin in tissue lesions.

96

We show here that SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to infect human monocytes and

97

macrophages. SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulated the production of immunoregulatory

98

cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 in both cell types and triggered in macrophages an

99

original transcriptional program enriched with M2-type genes. Macrophage polarization did

100

not account for permissivity to the virus since M1- and M2-polarized cells were similarly

101

infected by SARS-CoV-2. In Covid-19 patients, the numbers of classical, intermediate and

102

non-classical monocytes were decreased, irrespective of the level of severity. Their expression

103

of CD163, a molecule associated with the immunoregulatory phenotype, was significantly

104

higher than in healthy controls, whereas that of HLA-DR was decreased. Hence, SARS-CoV-

105

2 drives circulating monocytes and macrophages, inducing immunoparalysis of the host for

106

the benefit of Covid-19 disease progression.

Results

108

SARS-CoV-2 infects monocytes and macrophages and stimulates cytokine release

109

It has been shown that monocytes and macrophages express receptors for SARS-CoV-2 (24),

110

suggesting that the virus targets myeloid cells. We wondered whether SARS-CoV-2 was able

111

to infect human monocytes and macrophages. Monocytes, MDM and Vero cells were

112

incubated with SARS-CoV-2 strain IHU-MI3 (0.1 MOI) for 24 and 48 hours and infection

113

level was measured by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence. SARS-CoV-2 infected efficiently

114

Vero cells (Ct=18.69) after 24 hours, but a lytic process prevented the measurement of viral

115

replication, (Figure 1A). Monocytes were also infected after 24 hours (Ct=22.44), but the

116

viral load remained constant thereafter (Ct=22.2) (Figure 1A). Similarly, macrophages were

117

efficiently infected with the SARS-CoV-2 strain IHU-MI3 after 24 (Ct=22.49) and 48 hours

118

(Ct=19.67). In contrast to Vero cells, monocytes and macrophages were not uniformly

119

infected, as observed by confocal microscopy (Figure 1A, right panel). We next addressed

120

the ability of the IHU-MI3 strain of SARS-CoV-2 to induce the release of soluble mediators

121

from monocytes and MDMs. IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-β and TGF-β1 levels were

122

measured in supernatants of monocytes or MDM stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 for 24 and 48

123

hours. IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1β levels were significantly increased in stimulated monocyte

124

supernatants as compared to unstimulated conditions after 24 hours (Figure 1B) and were

125

persistently increased after 48 hours (Figure 1C), whereas no difference was observed for

126

TNF-α. In MDM supernatants, levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were increased after 24 and 48 hours

127

(Figure 1B and C). TGF-β levels were significantly increased in supernatants from

128

monocytes and MDMs after 48 hours of stimulation. IFN-β was never detected in

129

supernatants from monocytes or macrophages stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1B and

130

C). Taken together, SARS-CoV-2 infects monocytes and macrophages. The virus stimulates

131

the release of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

132
133

SARS-CoV-2 elicits a specific transcriptional program in macrophages

134

Next, the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response (IFNΑ, IFNΒ, IFNG,

135

TNF, IL1Β, IL6, IL8, CXCL10) or immunoregulation, (IL10, TGFΒ1, CD163) was measured

136

by qRT-PCR in monocytes and MDM incubated with the virus for 24 and 48 hours. PCA of

137

gene expression using ClustVis software showed that unstimulated and SARS-CoV-2-

138

stimulated monocytes exhibited superimposable programs; in contrast, unstimulated and

139

SARS-CoV-2-stimulated transcriptional programs were clearly distinct in macrophages

140

(Figure 2A). In monocytes, a 24 hour-incubation with SARS-CoV-2 stimulated the

141

expression of the whole gene panel, but only IFNΑ gene variation reached the significance

142

level (Figure 2B). After 48 hours, expression of IFNΑ declined to levels of unstimulated cells

143

and there was no other change in gene expression (Suppl figure 1), suggesting that SARS-

144

CoV-2 was only able to activate gene expression in monocytes in a transient manner.

145

We next investigated the transcriptional program induced by SARS-CoV-2 in macrophages.

146

Similar to monocytes, at 24 hours, SARS-CoV-2 significantly increased the expression of

147

antiviral (IFNΑ and IFNΒ ), inflammatory (CXCL10 and TNF), and immunoregulatory genes

148

(TGFΒ1 and CD163) (Figure 2B). The increase in gene expression was no longer observed

149

after 48 hours except for TGFΒ and CD163 (Suppl figure 1). Hence, the early transcriptional

150

program of infected macrophages consisted of genes associated with M1 profile (type I IFN,

151

CXCL10) and M2 profile (TGFΒ1 and CD163), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 does not induce

152

clear polarization of macrophages at the onset of the infection but rather a delayed shift

153

toward a M2-type.

154
155

Macrophage polarization and SARS-CoV-2 infection

156

As SARS-CoV-2 induced an early M1/M2 followed by a late M2 program in macrophages,

157

we investigated the effect of macrophage polarization status on infection. MDM polarization

158

was induced by IFN-γ (20 ng/ml) and lipopolysaccharide (100 ng/ml) (M1), IL-4 (20

159

ng/ml) (M2), or was kept at a resting state without polarization (M0). The polarization status

160

was confirmed by measuring the expression of M1 (IL1Β, IL1RA, IL6, IL12, CXCL10, TNF,

161

NOS2, IFNG) and M2 genes (ARG1, IL10, MR, CD163, TGFΒ). PCA and hierarchical

162

clustering confirmed the induction of three distinct activation statuses (Suppl. figure 2). The

163

expression of polarization-related genes was investigated after 24 and 48 hours of SARS-

164

CoV-2 stimulation of M1 and M2 polarized macrophages. The hierarchical clustering showed

165

that unstimulated and SARS-CoV-2-stimulated MDM (M0, M1 and M2) were present on two

166

distinct branches but the discrimination of responses as a function of polarization was not

167

possible (Suppl figure 3). Regarding pro- (IL-6, TNF) and anti- (IL-10, TGF-β)

168

inflammatory cytokines, SARS-CoV-2 stimulation significantly increased the release of both

169

cytokine groups in M1- and M2-polarized macrophages after 24 and 48 hours (Figure 3A, B).

170

In addition, no differences were observed in the viral load of M0, M1 or M2 macrophages

171

(Figure 3C). We next performed the same experiment using M0, M1 or M2 THP-1

172

macrophages. The choice of a cell line instead of primary macrophages aimed at minimizing

173

inter-individual variations. When THP-1 macrophages were M1 polarized, the viral load was

174

similar to that of non-polarized (M0) macrophages. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 load was

175

significantly decreased in M2 polarized macrophages as compared with M0 macrophages

176

(Figure 3C). Although a type 2 immune response was associated with lesser infection of

177

macrophages, their polarization did not appear critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

178
179

Monocyte subsets are altered in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients

180

Following the demonstration of a direct in vitro effect of SARS-CoV-2 on monocytes and

181

macrophages, we wondered if the frequency of monocyte subsets was affected in Covid-19

182

patients. Monocyte subsets were analyzed for CD14, CD16 and HLA-DR expression by flow

183

cytometry in 76 Covid-19 patients and compared to healthy blood donors (Figure 4A). In the

184

latter, classical monocytes were the best represented monocyte subset (9.17% of total

185

PBMCs), while intermediate and non-classical monocytes accounted for 0.42% and 0.60%,

186

respectively. In Covid-19 patients, the percentages of classical (2.03%), intermediate (0.23%)

187

and non-classical monocytes (0.22%) were significantly lower than in healthy controls

188

(Figure 4A). Hence, the monocytopenia previously reported in patients infected with SARS-

189

CoV-2 (25) affected all three monocyte subsets. We wondered if circulating monocytes

190

displayed changes in the expression level of activation-associated membrane markers. Hence,

191

we measured the expression of HLA-DR, a canonical marker of monocyte activation, and

192

CD163, an immunoregulatory marker. As shown in figure 4B, all three monocyte subsets

193

expressed HLA-DR and CD163. In Covid-19 patients, the expression level of HLA-DR was

194

significantly decreased in intermediate and non-classical monocytes, whereas it remained

195

similar to controls in classical monocytes (Figure 4B). In contrast, the expression of CD163

196

was significantly increased in classical and non-classical monocytes (Figure 4B). The

197

opposite effect of Covid-19 on HLA-DR and CD163 expression suggests that their activation

198

status was shifted to an immunoregulatory program. This phenotypic profile of patient

199

monocytes was partly recapitulated by incubating control monocytes with SARS-CoV-2.

200

SARS-CoV-2 increased HLA-DR expression in a dose dependent manner after 24 hours and

201

decreased it after 48 hours. The inverted pattern was observed with CD163 (Figure 4C).

202

Finally, we wondered if the decrease in monocyte subsets and altered expression of HLA-DR

203

and CD163 reflected the severity of Covid-19. There were no significant differences in

204

monocyte phenotype among mild, moderate, and severe patients (Figure 5). Hence variation

205

of monocyte HLA-DR and CD163 expression in Covid-19 patients was induced by SARS-

206

CoV-2 infection, but was not related to subsequent disease severity.

Discussion

208

We showed that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infects human monocytes and macrophages.

209

This is reminiscent of previous reports about SARS-CoV-1 that infects human macrophages

210

but does not replicate within (26). In addition, macrophages infected by SARS-CoV-1 were

211

detected in lungs of SARS patients (5). Recently, post-mortem examination of lymph nodes

212

and spleen revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in macrophages that

213

express CD169, a maker of macrophages from the splenic marginal zone (8). Using an

214

unsupervised computational pipeline that can detect viral RNA in any scRNA-seq data set, an

215

enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 reads in macrophages expressing secreted phosphoprotein 1 was

216

observed (27). Although monocytes and macrophages express the molecular machinery to

217

recognize and internalize SARS-CoV-2 such as ACE2, TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 (24), the

218

ability of the virus to replicate within these cells is not fully understood. Our results favor the

219

hypothesis of an abortive infection similar to SARS-CoV-1 (28) but clearly distinct from

220

MERS-CoV replication in macrophages (29).

221

The infection of monocytes and macrophages is associated with the production of

222

inflammatory cytokines that contribute to the CRS described in patients and involved in

223

disease pathogenesis. Monocytes and macrophages exhibit a common secretory profile

224

associating the release of IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-β and the absence of IFN-β. The impaired IFN

225

production is consistent with the reported inhibition of type I IFNs by SARS-CoV-1 and the

226

lack of interferon regulatory factor 3 activation in macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells

227

(5). In addition to preventing IFN-α/β responses, SARS-CoV downregulated IFN-related

228

genes in THP-1 cell lines (30). At least three SARS-CoV proteins, namely N protein, OrfB3

229

and Orf6, are known to antagonize the IFN-β response (31). While the release of IL-6 is

230

consistent with previous reports on the ability of SARS-CoV-1 to stimulate IL-6 secretion in

231

human MDM, the lack of significant changes in TNF release was not expected (26). It has

232

been shown in an in-situ study of post-mortem samples that SARS-CoV-2 induces IL-6 more

233

efficiently than TNF (8). In our hands, both monocytes and macrophages released IL-10 and

234

TGF-β, suggesting that anti-inflammatory cytokines are also involved in cell responses to

235

infection. The release of TGF-β by monocytes and macrophages may be associated with

236

tissue repair and generation of fibrosis that complicates Covid-19 evolution (32). Taken

237

together, our results suggest that the early response of monocytes and macrophages is

238

inflammatory whereas the delayed response promotes tissue repair. This model is in line with

239

the immune response unfolding in Covid-19 patients, in whom myeloid cells interact with

240

innate and adaptive immune partners able to redirect immune responses towards an

241

inflammatory status.

242

We found that SARS-CoV-2 differently affected the transcriptional programs of

243

monocytes and macrophages. In monocytes, SARS-CoV-2 elicited a transient program

244

dominated by the upregulation of IFNα gene, while macrophages exhibited a more diversified

245

transcriptional program associating inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes, which shifted

246

to an anti-inflammatory program of M2 type. Hence, SARS-CoV-2 affected macrophage

247

polarization according to the kinetics of infection. Previous reports on SARS-CoV-1 infection

248

showed a direct effect of virus on macrophage activation. In an African green monkey model,

249

SARS-CoV-1 activated pulmonary macrophages by polarizing them toward a M1 profile

250

associated with decreased viral load but persistence of inflammation (33). In a murine model

251

of SARS-CoV-1 infection, alveolar macrophages were repolarized to limit T cell activation

252

(34). Another study revealed that SARS-CoV-1 induced non protective M2 polarization in

253

lung macrophages from infected mice(35). Whether macrophage polarization affected their

254

capacity to control SARS-CoV-2 replication was not addressed. Using polarized MDM and

255

differentiated THP-1 cells, we found that non polarized and M1 type polarized macrophages

256

were permissive to SARS-CoV-2. This may explain why obesity and diabetes, conditions

257

associated with M1 macrophage polarization, are critical comorbidities in Covid-19 (36). In

258

our hands, M2 type macrophages tended to be less permissive to SARS-CoV-2. As estrogens

259

favor M2 polarization (37), this may explain why women are less affected than men by

260

Covid-19. In addition, patients with allergic asthma seem to be less susceptible to the virus

261

(38). Our results suggest that, instead of inducing a clear polarization, SARS-CoV-2

262

exacerbates macrophage responses whatever the type of polarization.

263

The myeloid compartment was analyzed through monocyte frequencies and the

264

expression of membrane markers. Previous reports established that monocytopenia was

265

detected in Covid-19 patients in association with lymphopenia. We showed that this decrease

266

in circulating monocytes affects all monocyte subsets. There is a lack of consensus about the

267

variations of monocyte count in Covid-19, probably because of the diversity of measurement

268

tools and the heterogeneity of patients in terms of evolution. A.J. Wilk et al reported depletion

269

of CD16+ monocytes including intermediate and non-classical monocytes in a single-cell

270

RNA sequencing study of Covid-19 PBMCs (39). A Cytof study of CD45+ mononuclear cells

271

revealed an initial increase in cell count from mild to severe followed by a decline in more

272

severe patients (40). Expansion of IL-6 producing CD14+CD16+ monocytes was reported in

275

Besides monocyte depletion in patients, remaining monocytes were characterized by a

276

down-modulation of HLA-DR and upregulation of CD163. HLA-DR down-modulation is in

277

agreement with previous studies. A. Gatti et al reported downregulation of monocyte HLA-

278

DR in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 (41). A sc-RNA seq study revealed that genes

279

encoding class II HLA molecules were downmodulated in Covid-19 patients(39). P. Bost

280

reported a disease-severity-associated signature in MDM in which MHC II and type I IFN

281

genes were downmodulated (27). Another study showed that CD14+ monocytes maintained

282

the expression of HLA-DR in mild/moderate patients, with down-modulation occurring only

283

in severe forms (42). Previously unreported CD163 upregulation in Covid-19 patients

284

suggests a monocyte polarization toward a M2-type profile. Immunohistochemical staining of

285

SARS pneumonia demonstrated CD163+ M2 macrophages in situ (43). M2 polarization is the

286

consequence of the release of immunoregulatory cytokines, but also of the interaction with the

287

virus. Indeed, we showed a trend in monocytes infected with SARS-CoV-2 with an increase

288

in CD163 expression paralleling low HLA-DR expression. It is known that IL-6 antagonizes

289

HLA-DR expression and the addition of the specific inhibitor of IL-6 pathway, tocilizumab,

290

partially restores HLA-DR expression of CD14+ monocytes from Covid-19 patients (42). A

291

synergism between SARS-CoV-2 and IL-6 is likely necessary to down-modulate the

292

expression of HLA-DR and to disarm microbicidal competence of monocytes and

293

macrophages.

294

Here, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 infects monocytes and macrophages without

295

cytopathic effect and induces a more sustained activation program in macrophages. Monocyte

296

and macrophage response to SARS-CoV-2 is more complex than expected from the

297

observation of CRS, to which they poorly contribute. The investigation of circulating

298

monocytes suggested that massive migration to tissues had occurred and remaining blood

299

monocytes exhibit a repairing profile. This observation may help understand the risk of post-

300

Covid-19 complication including fibrosis. Indeed, a subset of macrophages with a pro-fibrotic

301

program has been described in patients with Covid-19 (32). The lack of correlation between

302

monocyte count and monocyte functional polarization with severity stages suggest that

303

monocytes are markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is likely that other membrane markers of

304

myeloid cells are modulated according to disease progression and reflect more accurately the

305

inflammatory context associated with the severity. Taken together, our study showed that

Methods

309

Patients and ethical statement

310

Seventy-six consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed through reverse

311

transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA)

312

from March 16 through March 27, 2020 at the University Hospitals of Marseille, France, were

313

included. Not later than 48 hours post-diagnosis, patients underwent clinical laboratory tests

314

and

315

Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and outcome data were obtained from a

316

retrospective, non-interventional review of the medical charts and laboratory results.

317

Demographic characteristics of the study population are presented in table 1. This study was

318

performed on excess EDTA-anticoagulated total blood samples. According to French law, the

319

patients had received information that their excess samples and clinical data might be used for

320

research purposes, and retained the right to oppose (15,16).

322

Cell isolation

323

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the blood of Covid-19

324

patients and from buffy coats from healthy blood donors (Convention N°7828, “Etablissement

325

Français du Sang”, Marseille, France) by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll

326

(Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) as previously described (17). Monocytes were purified by CD14

327

selection using MACS magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Glabach, Germany) and

328

cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium-1640 (RPMI, Life Technologies,

329

Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 10% inactivated human AB-serum, 2 mM glutamine (Sigma

330

Aldrich, Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France), 100 U/mL penicillin and 50 µg/mL streptomycin

331

(Life Technologies). After 3 days, the medium was replaced by RPMI-1640 containing 10%

332

fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies) and 2 mM glutamine, and cells were

333

differentiated into macrophages for 4 additional days. For some experiments, THP-1

334

macrophages were used and cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS, 2mM glutamine

335

and 100 U/mL penicillin and 50 µg/mL streptomycin and differentiated into macrophages

336

after treatment with 50 ng/ml phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma Aldrich) for 48

340

SARS-CoV-2 strain IHU-MI3 was obtained after Vero E6 cells (American type culture

341

collection ATCC® CRL-1586™) infection in Minimum Essential Media (MEM) (Life

342

Technologies) supplemented with 4% FBS as previously described (20).

343

Cells were infected with 50 µl virus suspension (0.25, 0.5 or 0.1 multiplicity of infection

344

(MOI)) for 24 or 48 hours at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2 and 95% air in a humidified

345

incubator.

346
347

Immunofluorescence

348

After a 24 or 48-hour infection, cells were incubated in blocking buffer (Phosphate buffer

349

saline (PBS) supplemented with 5% FBS and 0.5% Triton X-100) for 30 minutes and washed

350

before incubation with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody (Life Technologies).

351

Nuclei and F-actin were stained using DAPI and Phalloidin (Life Technologies) respectively.

352

Pictures were obtained using an LSM800 Airyscan confocal microscope (Zeiss) and a 63X oil

353

objective.

354
355

Viral RNA extraction and q-RTPCR

356

Viral RNA was extracted from infected cells using NucleoSpin® Viral RNA Isolation kit

357

(Macherey-Nagel, Hoerdt, France) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Virus

358

detection was performed using One-Step RT-PCR SuperScript™ III Platinum™ Kit (Life

359

Technologies). Thermal cycling was achieved at 55°C for 10 minutes for reverse

360

transcription, pursued by 95°C for 3 minutes and then 45 cycles at 95°C for 15 seconds and

361

58°C for 30 seconds using a LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR system (Roche, Rotkreuz,

362

Switzerland). The primers and the probes were designed against the E gene (20).

363
364

RNA isolation and q-RTPCR

365

Total RNA was extracted from monocytes or macrophages (2.106 cells/well) using the

366

RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) and DNase I treatment to eliminate DNA

367

contaminants (21). The quality and quantity were evaluated using a spectrophotometer

368

(Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, USA). Reverse transcription of isolated RNA was

369

performed using a Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase kit (Life

370

Technologies) and oligo(dT) primers. q-PCR was performed using the Smart SYBRGreen fast

371

Master kit (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) and a CFX Touch RTPCR Detection System

372

(Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) using specific primers (Table 2). The results were

373

normalized using the housekeeping endogenous control actb gene encoding β-actin and are

1β, interferon (IFN)-β, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 (R&D Systems, Bio-Techne,

381

Novel Châtillon sur Seiche, France) and IL-6 (Clinisciences, Nanterre, France) was quantified

382

using specific immunoassay kits. The sensitivity of the assays was (pg/ml) 15.4 for IL-6, 3.9

383

for IL-10, 5.5 for TNF-α, 0.125 for IL-1β, 50 for IFN-β and 4.61 for TGF-β1.

385

Flow cytometry

386

PBMCs from healthy donors or Covid-19 patients were resuspended in PBS (Life

387

Technologies) containing 5% FBS and 2mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 minutes before

388

staining using the following fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (mouse IgG1): CD3

389

(UCHT1), CD20 (B9E9), CD14 (RMO52), CD16 (3G8) purchased from Beckman Coulter,

390

Paris, France; HLA-DR (G46-6) and CD163 (GHI/61) from BD Biosciences, Le Pont de

391

Claix, France, and appropriate isotype controls. A minimum of 50,000 events were acquired

392

for each sample using a BD Canto II instrument (BD Biosciences) and data were analyzed

393

with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).

394
395

Statistical analysis

396

Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism (7.0, La Jolla, CA), using the two-

397

way ANOVA test for viral quantification (Ct values) and transcriptional analysis,

398

nonparametric Kruskall-Wallis test for group comparison , nonparametric Mann-Whitney U

399

test for cytokine levels, and nonparametric t-test for flow cytometry results with monocyte

400

populations and surface marker expression. Turkey’s and Sidak’s tests were used for post-hoc

401

comparisons. qRT-PCR data for monocytes and macrophages, including principal component

402

analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering of gene expression, were analyzed using the

403

ClustVis webtool (23). Differences were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 infects monocytes and macrophages and stimulates cytokine

574

release. Vero E6 cells, monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages were infected with

575

SARS-CoV-2 IHU-MI3 strain (0.1 MOI) for 24 or 48 hours. (A) SARS-CoV-2 quantification

576

was evaluated by RT-PCR, expressed as Ct values and observed in red in infected cells, with

577

the nucleus in blue and F-actin in green (n = 3). Pictures were acquired using a confocal
