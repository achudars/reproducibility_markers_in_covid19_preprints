Abstract
The current pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and large progress in understanding
the pathology of the virus has been made since its emergence in late 2019. Several reports
indicate short lasting immunity against endemic coronaviruses, which contrasts repeated
reports that biobanked venous blood contains SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells even before the
outbreak in Wuhan. This suggests there exists a preformed T cell memory in individuals not
exposed to the pandemic virus. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to other members of the
Coronaviridae family , the endemic coronaviruses appear likely candidates to generate this T
cell memory. However, given the apparent poor immunological memory created by the endemic
coronaviruses, other immunity against other common pathogens might offer an alternative
explanation. Here, we utilize a combination of epitope prediction and similarity to common
human pathogens to identify potential sources of the SARS-CoV-2 T cell memory. We find that
no common human virus, other than beta-coronaviruses, can explain the pre-existing
SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals. Our study suggests OC43 and HKU1 are
the most likely pathogens giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 preformed immunity.

Introduction
The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) ​(1)​ with devastating consequences.
SARS-CoV-2 infections have a broad spectrum of manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic to
severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ​(2)​. The reason for this broad range
is unclear, but markedly decreased immune cell numbers ​(3,4)​, together with cytokine storm
(5)​, and dysregulation of lung infiltrating immune cells ​(6–9)​ have been associated with critical
COVID-19 manifestations. The virulence of SARS-CoV-2 is in contrast to the four endemic
coronaviruses (OC43, HKU1, 229E, NL63), which are responsible for the common cold with
usually mild symptoms ​(10)​.
T cells recognise peptides presented in the context of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I
and class II molecules. Peptides presented on the class I HLAs are generally recognised by CD8​+
cytotoxic T cells, while CD4​+​ T helper cells recognise peptides bound on the HLA class II
molecule. T cells are known to be cross reactive ​(11,12)​, that is, a single T cell can recognise
similar peptides derived from different pathogens presented by HLA molecules.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus elicits a T cells response during the infection ​(13)​. However, mounting
evidence suggests that also uninfected individuals are capable of responding to peptides derived
from the S-protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus ​(13–17)​, indicating a pre-existing immunity to the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein. A single influenza epitope has been identified by comparison of T cell
receptors ​(18)​, but the original pathogenic source of this pre-formed T cell memory is generally
unclear.
Given the high sequence similarity, the endemic coronaviruses are likely inducers of the
preexisting immunity. However, immunity to these coronaviruses appears short-lived as
antibody titers return to baseline levels at 4-12 months after infection ​(19–21)​. It can also not
be excluded that re-infection with the same coronavirus type can occur within a single year
(22)​. How the antibody titers translate to T cell immunity is not known. For influenza it is clear
that recurrent infections and epidemics are due to the accumulation of mutations in the
hemagglutinin and neuraminidase ​(23)​. However, the genetic drift of endemic coronaviruses
seems to be considerably slower than for Influenza A and B ​(24,25)​. Collectively, this indicates
that other frequently encountered pathogens besides the endemic coronaviruses could have
generated the preexisting immunity.
In the present report, we evaluate commonly occurring human pathogens for epitopes with a
very high similarity to potential SARS-CoV-2 epitopes.

Results
We identified a number of pathogens commonly causing infections in the European population
(Supplementary Tables 2-5). The list of pathogens included 32 viruses, 11 fungi, 26 bacteria and
2 parasites. We obtained all protein sequences for these pathogens from NCBI, and compared
these to predicted HLA-I and HLA-II binding epitopes in SARS-CoV-2, and ranked the pathogens
based on a relevance score (see Methods; Figure 1a).

Figure 1. Analysis approach.
a) 6, 7, 8mer k-mers were extracted from the proteins of relevant human pathogens and
compared to epitopes predicted in the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The epitope prediction was by
netMHCpan and netMHCIIpan. Pathogens were ranked based on k-mer hits to the epitopes. b)
Principle of Levenshtein distance of epitopes.
We observed different relevance scores for the same pathogen, depending on the length of
​ 6 we found that all viruses were in the upper half
k​-mers (Supplementary Figure 1 and 2). For ​k=
when ranking the relevance scores, while the viruses were in the lower half at ​k​=8. This was
independent of the HLA-class epitopes (Supplementary Figure 1 and 2).
Given the overall similarity between coronaviruses, the endemic coronaviruses are expected to
have the highest relevance score. Given the compact genome size and highly optimized proteins
(26)​ it seems likely that only short stretches will have an exact match, even when using a
reduced alphabet. Conversely, more complex organisms have larger and less optimized genes,
why the probability of matching longer stretches increases. We therefore focus on pathogens
with short (​k​=6) matches.

SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, we find a similar picture, with the exception of the appearance of Human
Gammaherpesvirus 4 (Epstein-Barr virus, EBV) in place of Trichomonas vaginalis (Figure 2b).

Figure 2. Some viruses and bacteria have peptides (k-mers) matching SARS-CoV-2
epitopes.
The top 10 pathogen relevance score was averaged over ​k-​ mers at the length of 6, 7, and 8
amino acids for a) HLA-I, and b) HLA-II. Pathogen relevance score for each pathogen an ​k​ are
presented in Supplementary figure 1 and 2.
Viral genes can be expressed at different times during an infection ​(27)​. However, during the
multiplication phase of the virus, the viral products are expressed in excess. To avoid selection
of pathogens based on highly similar, but rarely or poorly expressed proteins, we therefore
focus on the viruses in the following analysis.
Using netMHCpan and netMHCIIpan we predicted the epitopes in the reference sequences for
the coronaviruses OC43, HKU1, 229E, and NL63, as well as Influenza B, EBV, RV, and VZV.
Assessing the similarity to SARS-CoV-2 predicted epitopes, we calculated the Levenshtein
distance from each SARS-CoV-2 epitope to each of the predicted epitopes in the selected
pathogens (Figure 1b). The Levenshtein edit distance accounts for addition, deletion, and
exchange of amino acids to transform one epitope into another. We opted for this distance
metric to allow differences in epitope lengths. The edit distance was calculated per analyzed
HLA.
We found that the beta-coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 had the highest number of epitopes
identical to the predicted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. For HLA-I bound epitopes we found 211 and
195 identical epitopes in HKU1 and OC3, respectively (Figure 3a). For HLA-II bound epitopes we
found 493 and 464 identical epitopes in OC43 and HKU1, respectively (Figure 3b). When the
similarity threshold was relaxed to an edit distance of 1 or 2 we found a similar pattern (Figure
3). Interestingly, allowing three insertions, deletions, or exchanges we find the highest number
of similar SARS-CoV-2 HLA-I epitopes in VZV, followed by OC43, and HKU1 with 1292, 1189,
and 1163 epitopes, respectively (Figure 3a). This was not reflected in HLA-II bound epitopes.

This strong occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 similar VZV epitopes was mainly driven by epitopes on
HLA-B and HLA-C, and to a minor degree on HLA-A (Supplementary figures 3-5).

Figure 3. OC43 and HKU1 epitopes can be presented on many HLAs.
Epitopes were predicted using netMHCpan and netMHCIIpan in selected pathogens. The
similarity between each SARS-CoV-2 epitope and pathogen epitope was calculated using the
Levenshtein distance, and the number of shortest matches was enumerated. a) Total number of
HLA-I epitopes with an edit distance between 0 and 3 . b) Total number of HLA-II epitopes with
an edit distance between 0 and 3 . The pathogens are ordered per plot from highest to lowest,
while the fill colour is preserved.

Discussion
There is mounting evidence for preformed immunity against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2
(13–17)​. Reports on memory T cell response to the endemic coronaviruses are lacking, but since
antibody titers appear short-lived and frequent re-infections cannot be excluded ​(19–22)​, it is
probable that the endemic coronaviruses with low virulence do not create lasting immunity.
This then begs the question, which pathogen can generate a memory T cell response cross
reactive to SARS-CoV-2. Through ​in silico​ analysis of predicted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and
common pathogens we address this question.
When allowing some dissimilarity, VZV has the highest number of like SARS-CoV-2 epitopes.
However, this we only find for HLA-I, and in particular HLA-B and HLA-C, but not HLA-II. Since
SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells are found among both the HLA-I reactive CD8​+​ and among the
HLA-II reactive CD4​+​ it is not likely that VZV is the pathogen behind the SARS-CoV-2 cross
reactive T cells. Rather, only the endemic coronaviruses, and in particular the
beta-coronaviruses, have the highest number of epitopes similar to those predicted in the
SARS-CoV-2 virus.
While the prediction of HLA-I epitopes has high accuracy, the accuracy of HLA-II epitope
prediction is lower than that for HLA-I ​(28)​. One reason for this lower accuracy of HLA-II
epitope prediction is the dimer structure of the HLA-II making the peptide binding groove. In
fact, the HLA-II ɑβ-chain combinations have been estimated to be over 4000 in number. In
contrast, the combination of the HLA-I and β2-microglobulin chains yields less combinatorial
variation on the receptor. The epitope prediction with netMHCpan depends on a proper training
set. By focusing on the most frequent european HLAs, inaccuracies in the epitope prediction are
reduced or even avoided. We did not utilize epitope databases like VDJDB ​(29)​ and IEDB ​(30)​,
the reason being that these databases have a natural bias towards laboratory model antigen. For
instance, the most frequent epitopes in the Immune Epitope Database are human auto antigen
and epitopes derived from Trypanosoma cruzi.
The amino acid set was reduced from the 20 standard amino acids to 15 amino acids by
combining molecules with similar hydrophobic side chains. The advantage is the ease of
sequence comparison without alignment since the ​k​-mer is a complete substring of the target
protein. While the reduced amino acid alphabet is derived from structural considerations ​(31)​,
it cannot be excluded that alphabet reduction might skew the results. However, given the
requirements of anchor amino acids, which are buried within the HLA-molecule, the final results
should not change.
One limitation to the study is that we do not consider the frequency of pathogens nor the
potential expression level of the proteins and accessibility for the immune system. Both
arguably have an effect on the likelihood that an epitope can raise a robust immune response.
However, both variables can only be assessed with great uncertainty. Another limitation to the
study is the reliance on sequence similarity; although related epitopes are likely to interact with
the same T cell receptor, this is not guaranteed ​(32)​.

The finding that the beta-coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 are the most likely pathogens to give
rise to SARS-CoV-2 preformed immunity means that the endemic coronaviruses must be able to
generally raise a long lasting T cells response. Otherwise the epitopes recognized by the cross
reactive T cells share no high degree of similarity.
In conclusion, we conjecture that other beta-coronaviruses are the source for SARS-CoV-2 cross
reactive T cells.

Methods
The SARS-CoV2 protein sequences were downloaded from ViralZone ​(33;
https://viralzone.expasy.org/89966)​, accessed May 29, 2020. Uniprot IDs and common names
are listed in Supplementary Table 1. The common human pathogens evaluated in this study are
listed in Supplementary Tables 2-5. Pathogen protein sequences were extracted from the NCBI
"non-redundant" protein database ("nr", version 5, downloaded from
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA on May 31, 2020). The extraction was per pathogen
name, as stored in the Taxonomy database. For epitope comparison, the protein reference
sequences for the coronaviruses OC43, HKU1, 229E, and NL63, and Influenza B, Human
Gammaherpesvirus 4, Rotavirus A, and Human alphaherpesvirus 3, were downloaded from
https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/viral on 26.Jun.2020.
All potential MHC class I and class II epitopes in the SARS-CoV2 protein sequences, and selected
pathogen reference sequences, were identified using netMHCpan version 4.1 and netMHCIIpan
version 4.0, respectively, with default settings ​(34)​. For this step, the evaluated HLAs listed in
Supplementary Tables 6 and 7 were selected based on frequency in the European population as
reported in the Allele Frequency Net Database ​(35; http://www.allelefrequencies.net, June 1,
2020)​.
The Levenshtein distance between each predicted SARS-CoV-2 epitope to a predicted epitope in
a selected pathogen was calculated. The calculation as per pathogen and HLA and only the best
match was used.
Short peptides of length ​k (k​-mers) of lengths 6, 7, and 8 were extracted from the proteins of
each of the relevant pathogens and counted, for each value of ​k​ separately Each such multiset of
k-​ mers was prefiltered so that ​k​-mers found only once in a pathogen were removed if those
k-​ mers constituted a small fraction ​f​ or less of all ​k​-mers found for the pathogen. The analysis
was done separately for ​f​ in {0%, 1%, 5%}. The resulting ​k-​ mers were matched to the ​k​-mers
from the predicted epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 using a reduced 15 letter amino acid alphabet ​(31)​.
This amino acid alphabet allows mismatches of amino acids with similar properties by letting
the large hydrophobic amino acids V, L, I, and M be represented by L, the amino acids Y and F,
which are hydrophobic with aromatic side chains by F, and the positively charged K and R by K.
The more complex an organism, the more proteins are expressed. This means that the
probability of finding ​k​-mers matching epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 increases. To overcome this
problem we developed a ​pathogen relevance score​ to be evaluated for each triple of SARS-CoV-2
protein ​p​, pathogen species ​s​ and value of ​k​ (note that the quantity also depends on the filter
threshold f described above and on the considered set of epitopes, i.e. HLA class I or class II only
or combined). We thus define
S p,s,k := log2 [ (N p,s,k / T p,k ) / ( (P s + C ) / (15k + C ) ) ] ,
where N p,s,k is the number of ​k​-mer matched epitopes of protein ​p​ in species ​s,​ and
T p,k := ∑ N p,s,k is the number of such epitopes of protein ​p​ across all species; their ratio is
s

viewed in relation to the "richness" of the ​k-​ mer set of the pathogen species ​s,​ i.e. P s , the

number of distinct ​k-​ mers in pathogen s, divided by the total number of possible k-mers over
the reduced alphabet ( 15k ). To avoid bias in favor of underrepresented species (very small P s ),
we add a regularizing constant C when computing the fraction of ​k​-mers used by the species.
Thus the score is a log-observed-vs-expected-ratio indicating whether species ​s​ matches
unproportionally many SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that cannot be explained by its proteome size
alone.
To focus on possibly relevant pathogens in general rather than on a single SARS-CoV-2 protein,
we also considered an aggregated score
S s,k := log2 [ (N s,k / T k ) / ( (P s + C ) / (15k + C ) ) ] ,
where N s,k is the total number of ​k-​ mer matched epitopes in species ​s,​ and T k := ∑ N s,k is the
s

number of such epitopes across all species. The pathogens were then ranked according to score
(the highest score obtaining rank 1; the lowest score rank ​n​, where ​n​ is the number of
considered species). Then the average rank is computed over the different parameter
combinations k=6,7,8 and f=1%.
