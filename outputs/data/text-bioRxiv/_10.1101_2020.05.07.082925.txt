Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The rapid, sensitive and
specific diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by fast and unambiguous testing is widely
recognized to be critical in responding to the ongoing outbreak. Since the
current testing capacity of RT-PCR-based methods is being challenged due to
the extraordinary demand of supplies, such as RNA extraction kits and PCR
reagents worldwide, alternative and/or complementary testing assays should be
developed. Here, we exploit the potential of mass spectrometry technology
combined with machine learning algorithms as an alternative fast tool for SARSCoV-2 detection from nasopharyngeal swabs samples. According to our
preliminary

results,

mass

spectrometry-based

methods

combined

with

multivariate analysis showed an interesting potential as a complementary
diagnostic tool and further steps should be focused on sample preparation
protocols and the improvement of the technology applied.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2
virus, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 12th
2020 following its emergence in Wuhan China. As of the April 4th 2020 there
were over 1.2M confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 175 countries, with over
65,000 fatalities (Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, 2020). SARSCoV-2 is one of four new pathogenic viruses which have jumped from animal to
human hosts over the past 20 years, and the current pandemic sends warning
signs about the need for preparedness and associated research. Clinical
presentation of COVID-19 ranges from mild to severe with a high proportion of
the population having no symptoms yet being equally infectious (Yang et al.,
2020; Zhou et al., 2019). Together, these features have led to intensive
lockdown measures in most countries with the aim to restrict the spread of the
virus, limit the burden on healthcare systems and reduce mortality rate. In
parallel, there has been an extraordinary response from the scientific
community. These collective efforts aim to understand the pathogenesis of the
disease, to evaluate treatment strategies and to develop a vaccine at
unprecedented speeds in order to minimize its impact on individuals and on the
global economy (Li, 2016; Wenzhong and Hualan, Preprint).
The rapid, sensitive and specific diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by fast and
unambiguous testing is widely recognized to be critical in responding to the
outbreak. Since the current testing capacity of RT-PCR-based methods is being
challenged due to the extraordinary global demand of supplies such as RNA
extraction kits and PCR reagents, alternative and/or complementary testing

assays need to be deployed now in an effort to accelerate our understanding of
COVID-19 disease (Chin et al., 2020; Antezack et al., 2020).
The aim of this work was to assess the potential of MALDI-TOF MS technology
to create mass spectra from nasopharyngeal swabs in order to find specific
discriminatory peaks by using machine learning algorithms, and whether those
peaks were able to differentiate COVID-19 positive samples from COVID-19
negative samples.

Materials and methods
Sample preparation and MALDI-TOF data acquisition.
Samples. First, we analyzed in triplicate 25 samples of nasopharyngeal swab,
preliminary tested by RT-PCR (Corman et al., 2020) at the Reference
Respiratory Virus Laboratory INEI-ANLIS “Dr. Carlos G. Malbrán” in Argentina.
Of the 25 samples, 13 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 12 had nondetectable viral load for SARS-CoV-2 (8/12 were positive for the other
respiratory virus such as respiratory syncytial virus, Measles virus, Influenza A
and B virus, and endemic human coronavirus).
The analysis was carried out using the Bruker Daltonics MicroFlex LT
instrument version 3.4 (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Briefly, for the
assay, 1ul of each nasopharyngeal swab was applied onto 3 wells of the steel
MALDI plate (MSP 96 target ground steel; Bruker Daltonics), after the wells
have got dried, they were overlaid with 1 μl of HCCA matrix (a solution
containing α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid diluted into 500μL of acetonitrile,
250μL of 10% trifluoroacetic acid and 250μL of HPLC grade water).

All

manipulations were performed under certified class II biological safety cabinet
TELSTARTM BIO IIA (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Villebon sur Yvette, France)

and wearing all the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) required
to comply with biosafety standards (World Health Organization,

2020).

After

drying for a few minutes at room temperature, the plate was loaded into the
instrument and analyzed using MALDI-TOF software.
Spectra acquisition. Spectra were acquired manually (mode OFF), reaching
160-200 laser shots per well and within a mass-range of 1960-20200 Da using
FlexControl software v3.4 (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The platform
was previously calibrated using the Bruker Daltonics Bacterial Test Standard.
All spectra were verified using the Flex Analysis v3.4 software (Bruker
Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The spectra selected for model generation and
classification were treated according to a standard workflow including the
following steps: baseline subtraction, normalization, recalibration, average
spectra calculation, average peak list calculation, peak calculation in the
individual spectra and normalization of peak list for model generation.

MALDI-TOF MS spectra analysis.
Database development. MSP library construction.
Main Spectrum Profiles (MSPs) were performed according to manufacturer’s
instructions. All 25 samples were used to build an “in-house” database with
Maldi Biotyper OC V3.1 (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany); in addition,
dendrograms were performed to assess the relatedness of these MSPs using
default settings.

Biomarker assignment.
Spectra files from MSPs were exported as mzXML files using CompassXport
CXP3.0.5. (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) for visual analysis. At the
same time, a new database was created in Bionumerics v7.6.2 (Applied Maths,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.082925; this version posted May 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

Ghent, Belgium) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. All raw spectra
were imported into the Bionumerics database with x-axis trimming to a minimum
of 1960 m/z.
Baseline subtraction (with a rolling disc with a size of 50 points), noise
computing (continuous wavelet transformation, CWT), smooth (Kaiser Window
with a window size of 20 points and beta of 10 points), and peak detection
(CWT with a minimum signal to noise ratio of 1) were performed. Spectrum
summarizing, peak matching and peak assignment was performed according to
instructions from Bionumerics. In short, all raw spectra were summarized into
isolate spectra, and peak matching, using the option “existing peak classes
only”, was performed on isolate spectra using a constant tolerance of 1.9, a
linear tolerance of 550 and a peak detection rate of 10%. Binary peak matching
tables were exported to summarize the presence of peak classes. By assigning
biomarkers, only the presence and absence of peaks was investigated. To also
assess quantitative peak data such as peak intensity and peak area, a
multivariate unsupervised statistical tool PCA was additionally performed. All
samples were examined for the unique masses (± 10 Da).

Classifier models based on machine learning.
ClinProTools software. Peak data of all samples were used to define and train
machine learning based classifiers using ClinProTools V.2.2 software (Bruker
Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. In
brief, data analysis began with the loading of the raw data into the software and
they were grouped into different classes; first we created a two-class model
(Class 1 = SARS-CoV-2 detectable samples; Class 2= undetectable viral load
samples). The distribution of the elements is showed in Fig. 1.

Figure 1. 2D Peak Distribution Plot of 2 classes model. This plot displays the distribution of two
selected peaks in the non-excluded spectra on the loaded model generation classes. The data
is shown on a two-dimensional plane. By default, the first two (=best separating) peaks of the
current statistic sort order are displayed. The ellipses represent the standard deviation of the
peak area/intensities.

Then a three-class model (Class 1 = SARS-CoV-2 detectable samples; Class 2
= undetectable viral load samples and Class 3 = other respiratory virus) was
developed. Pretreatment, normalization, baseline subtraction, peak defining
(range 1960-20000 m/z), recalibration; and then, the automatic comparison of
multiple spectra was performed. Values of m/z from the average spectra of
each class and informative peaks were identified according to their statistical
significance, as determined by the different statistical tests supported by
ClinProTools: Anderson–Darling test, t-/ analysis of variance (ANOVA) test and
Wilcoxon/Kruskal–Wallis tests. Informative peaks were those showing a
significant difference between the classes whether: the p-value for the
Anderson–Darling test was >0.05 and for the t-/ANOVA or Wilcoxon/Kruskal–
Wallis test was ≤0.05, or if the p-value for the Anderson–Darling test was ≤0.05

Classification models were generated using all three available algorithms
(Supervised Neural Network, Genetic Algorithm and QuickClassifier) and they
were later compared.

For each model, the recognition capability (RC) and

cross validation (CV) percentage was generated to demonstrate the reliability
and accuracy of the model. RC and CV percentages were indicators of the
model’s performance and useful predictors of the model’s ability to classify test
samples. The model with the highest RC and CV values was used in the
analysis.

Statistical analysis
For evaluating the performance of the different approaches mentioned,
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive prediction and negative prediction were
calculated (ClinPro Tools 3.0: User Manual, 2011).

Results
The results were analyzed according to the following approaches: Biomarker
findings, construction of an “in-house” database and through the design of
predictive models by machine learning.

Detection of potential Biomarkers.
Manual analysis of the spectra obtained by Flex Analysis v3.4 software
revealed one potential peak of negativity which was not detected in most of the
positive samples: 4551 Da.
When BioNumerics software was used, another potential biomarker was found
in 60% of negative samples and only in 16% of positives: 3142 Da.
This peak is also detected with reproducible intensity in the average spectrum
of that same class in ClinProTools (Fig. 2).

software.

Evaluation of the novel “in-house” database.
The novel database was challenged with 30 previously-characterized samples
different than those used to create it. They were processed in the same way as
to create the complementary library and the wells were read in the MALDI
Biotyper OC v3.1 software according to the manufacturer's recommendations,
for an offline classification, obtaining the following results: 12 of 19 positive
samples (63%) were correctly identified with score values >1.70; 1 of 19 (5%)
was miss identified and 6 of 19 (32%) presented low score values, making
identification not reliable. Contrasting, 8 of 11 of negative samples (73%) were
identified correctly presenting score values above 1.70; 2 samples (18%) were
miss identified and only 1 (9%) presented low score values. Samples with low
score values were not included in the statistical analysis.

Machine Learning models.

models used are summarized in Table 2.

Discussion
MALDI-TOF MS is a simple, inexpensive and fast technique that analyses
protein profiles with a high reliability rate, and could be used as a rapid
screening method in a large population (Croxatto et al., 2012). These
preliminary results suggest that MALDI-TOF MS coupled with ClinProTools
software represents an interesting alternative as a screening tool for diagnosis
of SARS-CoV-2, especially because of the good performance and accuracy
obtained with samples in which viral presence was not detected. More samples
need to be analyzed in order to make a definitive statement. However, this
study using MALDI-TOF combined with machine learning has proven to be, as
far as we know, a revolutionary alternative that deserves further development.

Conclusions
The identification of specific biomarkers responsible for each peak or group of
peaks represents a difficult and demanding task that requires further specific
studies. Based on the promising preliminary results, we should focus on the
improvement of this potential diagnosis approach by assaying various
techniques for proteins extraction to the clinical samples and on the expansion
of the complementary database in the near future.
These results constitute the basis for further research and we encourage
researchers to explore the potential of MALDI-TOF MS in order to assess the
feasibility of this technology, widely available in clinical microbiology
laboratories, as a fast and inexpensive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tool.
