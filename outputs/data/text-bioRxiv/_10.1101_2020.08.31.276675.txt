Abstract

49
50

India is one of the countries most affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic.

51

Characterization of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including immunoglobulin

52

isotype usage, neutralizing activity and memory B cell generation, is necessary to provide

53

critical insights on the formation of immune memory in Indian subjects. In this study, we

54

evaluated SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody

55

responses, neutralization of live virus, and RBD-specific memory B cell responses in pre-

56

pandemic healthy versus convalescent COVID-19 individuals from India. We observed

57

substantial heterogeneity in the formation of humoral and B cell memory post COVID-19

58

recovery. While a vast majority (38/42, 90.47%) of COVID-19 recovered individuals

59

developed SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG responses, only half of them had appreciable

60

neutralizing antibody titers. RBD-specific IgG titers correlated with these neutralizing

61

antibody titers as well as with RBD-specific memory B cell frequencies. In contrast, IgG titers

62

measured against SARS-CoV-2 whole virus preparation, which includes responses to

63

additional viral proteins besides RBD, did not show robust correlation. Our results suggest

64

that assessing RBD-specific IgG titers can serve as a surrogate assay to determine the

65

neutralizing antibody response. These observations have timely implications for identifying

66

potential plasma therapy donors based on RBD-specific IgG in resource-limited settings

67

where routine performance of neutralization assays remains a challenge.

Importance

72
73

Our study provides an understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies,

74

binding antibodies and memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent subjects from India. Our

75

study highlights that PCR-confirmed convalescent COVID-19 individuals develop SARS-CoV-

76

2 RBD-specific IgG antibodies, which correlate strongly with their neutralizing antibody

77

titers. RBD-specific IgG titers, thus, can serve as a valuable surrogate measurement for

78

neutralizing antibody responses. These finding have timely significance for selection of

79

appropriate individuals as donors for plasma intervention strategies, as well as determining

80

vaccine efficacy.

Introduction

82
83

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for

84

the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, emerged as a grave public health threat

85

beginning in December 2019(1), paralyzing daily lives and causing economic downturns in

86

many parts of the world. Currently, India is one of the countries most affected with more

87

than 3 million COVID-19 confirmed cases and 60,000 associated deaths (2).

88
89

Intense efforts are underway to develop vaccines and antiviral therapeutics (3-11). These

90

efforts require a detailed understanding of immune correlates of protection, formation of

91

immune memory, and durability of these responses. Additionally, infusion of plasma derived

92

from COVID-19 recovered individuals is also being explored as a treatment strategy (12-20).

93

All these efforts require a detailed understanding of humoral immunity, immunoglobulin

94

isotype usage and neutralizing activity following recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

95

Moreover, given that many of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing epitopes are located in the viral

96

receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) protein (21-29), it is important to evaluate

97

the relationship between RBD-specific IgG titers and neutralizing antibody responses.

98
99

In this study, we evaluated IgG, IgA, IgM, neutralizing antibodies and memory B cell

100

responses in PCR-confirmed COVID-19 convalescent subjects. Our results show that while a

101

vast majority (38/42, 90.47%) of COVID-19 recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2

102

RBD-specific IgG responses, we were able to detect appreciable levels of neutralizing

103

antibody responses in only half of the convalescent subjects. Neutralizing responses

104

correlated closely with RBD-specific IgG titers, but weakly with IgG titers measured against

105

crude virus concentrate using a commercial ELISA kit. Taken together, these findings suggest

106

that despite significant inter-individual variation in the RBD-specific IgG titers and

107

neutralizing antibodies, RBD-specific IgG titers can serve as a valuable and robust surrogate

108

measurement for neutralizing antibody responses. These observations not only provide a

109

glimpse of humoral immune responses in COVID-19 recovered individuals from India, but

110

also have timely implications for identifying potential plasma therapy donors using on RBD-

111

specific IgG ELISA’s in India where routine performance of neutralization assays remains a

112

challenge.

Methods

114
115

Subject recruitment

116

COVID-19 recovered individuals were recruited at Shaheed Hasan Khan Mewati Government

117

Medical College, Nuh, Haryana, India, Super Specialty Pediatric Hospital and Post Graduate

118

Teaching Institute, Noida and ICMR-National Institute of Malaria Research, New Delhi. The

119

Institutional ethical boards approved the study. Informed consent was obtained prior to

120

inclusion in the study. All subjects (mean age 39.4 years, range 15 – 70 years) were SARS-

121

CoV-2 PCR positive at the time of initial diagnosis, and were PCR negative when recruited for

122

this study at 3.6 – 12 weeks post initial diagnosis (Table 1). Samples collected from healthy

123

adult blood bank donors in the year 2018 are included as pre-pandemic controls.

124

SARS-CoV-2 specific PCR

125

SARS-CoV-2 specific rRT-PCR was performed as per the Indian government guidelines for

126

COVID-19 diagnosis. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were collected in viral transport

127

medium (VTM) (HiMedia, #AL 167)) and transported to the testing laboratory maintaining

128

cold chain. All the samples were subjected to the first line screening assay or the ‘e’ gene

129

assay as per the guidelines (30). Samples reactive by the first line assay were subjected to

130

the RdRp gene assay (Invitrogen SuperScript™ III Platinum® One-Step Quantitative Kit (Cat.

131

No.11732088). Samples reactive for both the genes were labeled positive, while samples

132

reactive to ‘e’ gene only were considered indeterminate and were subjected to repeat

133

sampling. The same protocol was used to verify that the subjects were PCR negative at the

134

time of recruitment for this study.

135

SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific direct ELISA

136

Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RDB gene was cloned, expressed, purified and standard direct

137

ELISAs were performed as previously described (31). Briefly, purified RBD was coated on

138

MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Fisher, #439454) at a concentration of 1 ug/mL in 100 uL

139

phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4oC overnight. The plates were washed extensively with

140

PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20. Three-fold serially diluted plasma samples were added to

141

the plates and incubated at room temperature for 1hr. After incubation, the plates were

142

washed and the SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific IgG, IgM, IgA signals were detected by incubating

143

with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated - anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch

144

Labs, #109-036-098), IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, #109-036-129), or IgA (Jackson

145

ImmunoResearch Labs, #109-036-011). Plates were then washed thoroughly and developed

146

with o-phenylenediamine (OPD) substrate (Sigma, #P8787) in 0.05M phosphate-citrate

147

buffer (Sigma, #P4809) pH 5.0, containing with 0.012% hydrogen peroxide (Fisher Scientific,

148

#18755) just before use. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm.

149

Enumeration of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific memory B cells

150

Purified RBD protein (100 ug) was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 using microscale protein

151

labeling kit (Life Technologies, #A30006) as per manufacturer’s protocol. PBMC’s were

152

stained with RBD-Alexa Fluor 488 for 1 hour at 4oC, followed by washing with PBS containing

153

0.25% FBS, and incubation with efluor780 Fixable Viability (Live Dead) dye (Life

154

Technologies, #65-0865-14) and anti-human CD3, CD19, CD27, CD38 and IgD antibodies (BD

155

Biosciences) for 30 minutes. Cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and acquired on BD

156

LSR Fortessa X20. Data was analyzed using FlowJo software 10. SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific

157

memory B cells were identified in cells positive for CD19, CD20, CD27 that were negative for

158

IgD and CD3.

160

IgG ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 whole virus preparation

161

SARS-CoV-2 antigen specific IgG was detected using a commercially available assay (COVID-

162

Kavach ELISA tests kit, Zydus diagnostics), which measures responses to antigen

163

concentrated from gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2-infected tissue culture fluid as per the

164

manufacturer’s instructions (32, 33).

165

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay

166

Neutralization titers to SARS-CoV-2 were determined as previously described (31). Briefly

167

infectious clone of the full-length mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV/USA_WA1/2020)

168

was used to test heat-inactivated COVID-19 convalescent samples and healthy donor

169

samples (pre-pandemic). Heat-inactivated serum was serially diluted three-fold in duplicate

170

starting at a 1:20 dilution in a 96-well round-bottom plate and incubated between 750 FFU

171

of ic-SARS-CoV-2-mNG for 1 h at 37°C. This antibody-virus mixture was transferred into the

172

wells of a 96-well plate that had been seeded with Vero-E6 cells the previous day at a

173

concentration of 2.5× 104 cells/well. After 1 hour, the antibody-virus inoculum was removed

174

and 0.85% methylcellulose in 2% FBS containing DMEM was overlaid onto the cell

175

monolayer. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. Cells were washed three times with

176

1XPBS (Corning Cellgro) and fixed with 125 µl of 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Electron

177

Microscopy Sciences) for 30 minutes. Following fixation, plates were washed twice with 1x

178

PBS and imaged on an ELISPOT reader (CTL Analyzer). Foci were counted using Viridot (34)

(counted first under the “green light” setting followed by background subtraction under the

180

“red light” setting). FRNT-mNG50 titers were calculated by non-linear regression analysis

181

using the 4PL sigmoidal dose curve equation on Prism 8 (Graphpad Software).

182

Neutralization titers were calculated as 100% x [1- (average foci in duplicate wells incubated

183

with the specimen) ÷ (average number of foci in the duplicate wells incubated at the highest

184

dilution of the respective specimen).

185

Statistical analysis

186

Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad prism 8.0 software. Non-parametric t test

187

(Mann-Whitney) was used to calculate the differences between groups. Non-parametric

188

Spearman’s correlation coefficient (r) was used to calculate correlation between groups.

189

A p value of <0.05 was considered as significant.

SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific humoral immunity in COVID-19 recovered individuals.

194

The demographic profile of COVID-19 recovered individuals recruited for this study is shown

195

in Table 1. All subjects were at least 3.6 weeks past their initial SARS-CoV-2 positive

196

diagnosis. RBD-specific ELISA curves for IgG, IgA and IgM at different dilutions of plasma in

197

pre-pandemic healthy versus COVID-19 recovered individuals are shown in Figure 1. RBD-

198

specific responses were highly elevated in COVID-19 recovered individuals as compared to

199

pre-pandemic healthy controls (Figure 1A,B,C, left versus middle panels). Titers of IgG,

200

IgA and IgM in the COVID-19 recovered individuals showed substantial inter-individual

201

variation (Figure 1 A, B, C, right panel) - with IgG endpoint titers ranging from below

202

detection to 24484 (2000+619); IgA titers from below detection to 5686 (386+136) and IgM

203

titers from below detection to 2958 (515+90). Four individuals had undetectable RBD-

204

specific IgG and IgA titers. One of these individuals was also below detection for IgM (Table

205

2). Inter-individual heterogeneity was not related to the age of the individuals (Figure 2A)

206

or the number of days that elapsed between PCR confirmation of infection and sample

207

collection (Figure 2B).

SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing titers in COVID-19 recovered individuals.

210

To assess plasma neutralizing titers from COVID-19 convalescent individuals, we performed

211

a live virus neutralization assay using a focus-reduction neutralization mNeonGreen (FRNT-

212

mNG) assay (31). The neutralizing activity at different dilutions of plasma for pre-pandemic

213

healthy individuals (Figure 3A) and COVID-19 recovered individuals is shown in (Figure

214

3B). Figure 3C shows FRNT-mNG50 titers calculated based on the plasma dilution that

215

neutralized 50% of the virus. While all pre-pandemic healthy individuals had undetectable

216

FRNT-mNG50 titers, only half of the COVID-19 recovered individuals showed 50% or more

217

neutralization even at a 1:20 dilution of plasma. Similar to RBD-specific IgG titers, the FRNT-

218

mNG50 titers were heterogeneous with the latter reaching titers as high as 682 (Figure 3C).

219
220

Previous studies in other viral infections have shown that all three antibody isotypes (IgG,

221

IgA and IgM) can potentially neutralize (35-39). We next determined if any correlation exists

222

between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers and RBD-specific IgG, IgA, IgM binding antibody

223

titers. We observed a positive correlation (r=0.83; p<0.001) between SARS-CoV-2

224

neutralizing titers and RBD-specific IgG titers (Figure 4, left graph) but not with IgA

225

(Figure 4, middle graph) or IgM titers (Figure 4, right graph).

226
227

Plasma infusion therapy has recently been started in India as an intervention therapy for

228

COVID-19. For this, plasma donors are being typically identified by the presence of IgG to

229

SARS-CoV-2 by commercial ELISA tests (40). One of these tests detects IgG towards viral

230

antigens concentrated from gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2-infected tissue culture fluid (32,

231

33). It was therefore of interest to examine the correlation between neutralization titers and

232

IgG responses measured using this test. We observed that, of the 42 COVID-19 recovered

233

individuals tested, 33 were IgG positive whereas 9 were below the assay cut off (Figure 5A).

234

Of the 9 individuals that were below cut off, 4 also tested negative by the RBD-specific IgG

235

ELISA (Table 2). All of the samples from the pre-pandemic healthy individuals were below

236

the limit of detection using both the ELISA methods. Most importantly, the IgG values

237

obtained by whole virus-based ELISA did not show as robust a correlation (r=0.56) with

238

neutralizing antibody titers (Figure 5B) as compared to those observed with RBD-specific

239

IgG titers (r=0.83) (Figure 4, left graph).

240
241

Characterization of RBD-specific memory B cells in COVID-19 recovered individuals.

242

While circulating neutralizing antibodies help prevent re-infection by viruses, memory B

243

cells allow for rapid production of new antibodies in case of re-infection. To address whether

244

the COVID-19 recovered individuals generated memory B cells, we enumerated RBD-specific

245

memory B cells using fluorescently-conjugated RBD antigen. An example of the flow

246

cytometric gating strategy and RBD staining among the gated memory B cells is shown in

247

Figure 6A and 6B. Figure 6C shows the frequency of RBD-specific memory B cells in a

248

subset of the individuals where sufficient PBMCs were available. Though we found that there

249

was substantial inter-individual variation in the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific

250

memory B cells, their frequencies modestly correlated with RBD-specific IgG titers.

Discussion

252
253

Our study provides a detailed understanding of humoral immunity and memory B cells in

254

COVID-19 recovered individuals from India. We examined SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing

255

antibodies, IgG, IgM, IgA and memory B cells in pre-pandemic healthy versus COVID-19

256

recovered individuals and further evaluated inter-individual variation and relation among

257

these.

258
259

Our correlative analysis of RBD-specific IgG binding titers with neutralizing antibody titers

260

and memory B cells has important implications for not only identifying potential donors for

261

plasma therapy but also for understanding humoral and cellular memory post COVID-19.

262

Though current plasma therapy guidelines in India do not consider neutralizing antibody

263

titers, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines recommend, when

264

available, a neutralizing titer of 1:160 or 1:80 to be used for identifying potential plasma

265

donors (41). Our correlation analysis shows that RBD-specific titers of more than 3668 can

266

provide a suitable surrogate for identifying the individuals with neutralizing titers of above

267

1:160 and RBD-specific IgG titers 1926 for neutralizing titers of 1:80. Though larger scale

268

studies are needed to establish robustness, these observations have timely implications to

269

identify potential plasma therapy donors.

270
271

Our study raises important questions on formation of protective immune memory after

272

recovering from COVID-19. We found that nearly half of the COVID-19 recovered individuals

273

did not induce 50% neutralizing titers even at 1:20 dilution of plasma. This raises the

274

question of whether these individuals with low neutralizing antibodies also differ in

275

formation of cellular immune memory. Our data show that individuals with low neutralizing

276

antibodies indeed had lower memory B cells. Given that T cells may also contribute to COVID-

277

19 protection, studies are needed to understand whether these individuals may also differ

278

in the generation of memory CD8 and CD4 T cells (42-44).

279
280

The reason why only half of the COVID-19 recovered individuals developed appreciable

281

levels of neutralizing antibody titers requires further investigation. This may be related to

282

inter-individual differences in human immune responses associated with the expected

283

heterogeneity in initial viral inoculum(45), initial viral loads (46-48), incubation period (49),

284

host genetic factors (50-52) and disease severity (53, 54). This is consistent with previous

285

studies that show relatively higher neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 hospitalized patients

286

during the acute febrile phase, or in recovered individuals that were previously hospitalized

287

with severe COVID-19 disease (53, 54). It is noteworthy that the COVID-19 recovered

288

individuals from our study had mild to moderate symptoms during the initial diagnosis. In

289

light of these studies, our findings warrant future studies to seek an understanding of

290

whether the individuals that have generated low or no neutralizing antibodies, IgG titers or

291

memory B cells past recovery will be protected if they were re-exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or a

292

related virus.
