Abstract
Several fast-spreading variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) have become the dominant circulating strains that continue to fuel the
COVID-19 pandemic despite intensive vaccination efforts throughout the world. We
report here cryo-EM structures of the full-length spike (S) trimers of the B.1.1.7 and
B.1.351 variants, as well as their biochemical and antigenic properties. Mutations in the
B.1.1.7 protein increase the accessibility of its receptor binding domain and also the
binding affinity for receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The enhanced
receptor engagement can account for the increased transmissibility and risk of mortality
as the variant may begin to infect efficiently infect additional cell types expressing low
levels of ACE2. The B.1.351 variant has evolved to reshape antigenic surfaces of the
major neutralizing sites on the S protein, rendering complete resistance to some potent
neutralizing antibodies. These findings provide structural details on how the wide spread
of SARS-CoV-2 enables rapid evolution to enhance viral fitness and immune evasion.
They may guide intervention strategies to control the pandemic.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) (1), has led to loss of human life in millions, as well as devastating socioeconomic disruptions worldwide. Although the mutation rate of the coronavirus is
relatively low because of the proofreading activity of its replication machinery (2),
several variants of concern (VOCs) have emerged in different countries, including the
B.1.1.7 lineage first identified in the United Kingdom, the B.1.351 lineage in South
Africa and the B.1.1.28 lineage in Brazil within a period of several months (3-5). These
variants not only appear to spread more rapidly than the virus from the initial outbreak
(i.e., the strain Wuhan-Hu-1; ref(1)), but also are more resistant to immunity elicited by
the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain in the setting of either natural infection or vaccination (6-8). The
B.1.1.7 variant is of particularly concern because it has been reported to be significantly
more deadly (9, 10). Thus, understanding the underlying mechanisms of the increased
transmissibility, risk of mortality and immune resistance of the new variants may
facilitate development of intervention strategies to control the crisis.
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus that depends on fusion of
viral and target cell membranes to enter a host cell. This first key step of infection is
catalyzed by the virus-encoded trimeric spike (S) protein, which is also a major surface
antigen and thus an important target for development of diagnostics, vaccines and
therapeutics. The S protein is synthesized as a single-chain precursor and subsequently
cleaved by a furin-like protease into the receptor-binding fragment S1 and the fusion
fragment S2 (Fig. S1; ref(11)). It is generally believed that binding of the viral receptor
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell surface to the receptor-binding
domain (RBD) of S1, together with a second proteolytic cleavage by a cellular serine
protease TMPRSS2 or endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L (CatB/L) in S2
(S2’ site; Fig. S1; ref(12)), induce large conformational changes and prompt dissociation
of S1 and irreversible refolding of S2 into a postfusion structure, ultimately leading to
membrane fusion (13, 14). In the prefusion conformation, S1 folds into four domains NTD (N-terminal domain), RBD, and two CTDs (C-terminal domains), and they wrap
around the prefusion structure of S2. The RBD can adopt two distinct conformations –

“up” for a receptor-accessible state and “down” for a receptor-inaccessible state (15).
Remarkable progress in structural biology of the S protein has been achieved rapidly
since the early stage of the pandemic, advancing our knowledge on the SARS-CoV-2
entry process considerably (15-28). We have previously identified two structural
elements - the FPPR (fusion peptide proximal region) and 630 loop, which appear to
modulate the overall stability of the S protein, as well as the RBD conformation and thus
the receptor accessibility (22, 28).
The S protein is the centerpiece of almost all the first-generation COVID-19 vaccines,
which were developed shortly after the initial outbreak using the sequence of the WuhanHu-1 strain (29, 30). Several of them have completed phase 3 trials, showing impressive
protective efficacy with minimal side effects (31, 32), and they have therefore received
Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by various regulatory agencies throughout the
world. These vaccines appear to have somewhat lower efficacy against the B.1.351
variant than against its parental strain (6-8, 33). In addition, this variant became
completely resistant to many convalescent serum samples from those recovered from
COVID-19 (8). How to address genetic diversity has therefore become a high priority for
developing next-generation vaccines. In this study, we have characterized the full-length
S proteins from the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants and determined their structures by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), providing a structural basis for understanding the
molecular mechanisms of the enhanced infectivity, risk of mortality and immune evasion
of these two variants.
Results
Biochemical and antigenic properties of the intact S proteins from the new variants
To characterize the full-length S proteins with the sequences derived from natural isolates
of the B.1.1.7 (hCoV-19/England/MILK-C504CD/2020) and B.1.351 (hCoV-19/South
Africa/KRISP-EC-MDSH925100/2020) variants (Fig. S1), we first transfected HEK293
cells with the respective expression constructs and compared their membrane fusion
activities with those of the full-length S constructs of their parental strains (Wuhan-Hu-1:
D614, and its early variant with D614G substitution: G614 (34)). All S proteins

expressed at comparable levels, as judged by western blot (Fig. S2A). The cells
expressing these S proteins fused efficiently with the cells transfected with a human
ACE2 construct (Fig. S2B), indicating that they are fully functional as a membrane
fusogen. Consistent with our previous findings (22, 28), the G614 and B.1.351 variant S
constructs showed slightly higher fusion activity than those of the D614 and B.1.1.7
variant, but the differences diminished when the transfection level increased.
To produce the full-length S proteins, we added a C-terminal strep-tag to the B.1.1.7 and
B.1.351 S (Fig. S3A), expressed and purified these proteins under the identical conditions
established for producing the D614 and G614 S trimers (22, 28). The B.1.1.7 protein
eluted in three distinct peaks representing the prefusion S trimer, the postfusion S2 trimer
and the dissociated S1 monomer, respectively (22), consistent with Coomassie-stained
SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. S3B). Nonetheless, the prefusion trimer was still the
predominant form, accounting for >70% of the total protein. Like the G614 trimer (28),
B.1.351 protein eluted as a single major peak, corresponding to the prefusion S trimer
(Fig. S3B), with no obvious peaks for dissociated S1 and S2. SDS-PAGE analysis
showed that the peaks for the prefusion trimers contained primarily the cleaved S1/S2
complex for both the proteins with the cleavage level moderately higher for B.1.351 S
than for B.1.1.7 S. These results indicate that the B.1.351 and G614 S proteins have
almost identical biochemical properties, while the B.1.1.7 S trimer is slightly less stable.
To assess antigenic properties of the purified prefusion S trimers from the new variants,
we first measured by bio-layer interferometry (BLI) their binding to recombinant soluble
ACE2 and S-directed monoclonal antibodies isolated from COVID-19 convalescent
individuals. These antibodies target various epitopic regions on the S trimer, as defined
by clusters of competing antibodies and designated RBD-1, RBD-2, RBD-3, NTD-1,
NTD-2 and S2 (Fig. S4A; ref(35)). All but the last two clusters contain neutralizing
antibodies. The B.1.1.7 variant bound substantially more strongly to the receptor than did
its G614 parent, regardless of the oligomeric state of ACE2 (Figs. 1 and S4B; Table S1).
The B.1.351 protein had higher affinity for monomeric ACE2, but slightly lower affinity
for dimeric ACE2, than did the G614 trimer. In both cases, affinity for ACE2 of the

B.1.351 protein was significantly lower than that of the B.1.1.7 variant. These results
suggest that the mutations in the RBD of the B.1.1.7 variant, N501Y in particular,
enhance receptor recognition, while the additional mutations in the B.1.351 variant (i.e.,
K417N and E484K) reduce ACE2 affinity to a level close to that of the G614 protein. All
selected monoclonal antibodies bound the G614 S with reasonable affinities, and the
B.1.1.7 variant showed a similar pattern but with substantially stronger binding to almost
all the antibodies (Figs. 1 and S4B; Table S1). In contrast, the B.1.351 variant completely
lost binding to the two RBD-2 antibodies, 32B6 and 12A2, as well as to the two NTD-1
antibodies, 12C9 and 83B6, while the affinities for the rest of the antibodies were the
same as those of the G614 trimer. An RBD-3 antibody, 63C7, which recognizes the
RBD-up conformation, bound more strongly to the B.1.1.7 trimer than to the G614 and
B.1.351 proteins, for which it had affinities nearly equal to each other. To rule out
potential artifacts associated with the proteins purified in detergent, we tested by flow
cytometry binding of these antibodies and of a designed trimeric ACE2 construct to the S
proteins expressed on the cell surfaces. As shown in Fig. S5, the binding results with the
membrane-bound S trimers are largely in agreement with the data measured by BLI. In
particular, the B.1.1.7 S had a substantially higher affinity for the trimeric ACE2 than did
the G614 and B.1.351 proteins.
We also assessed the neutralization potency of the antibodies and the trimeric ACE2
construct in blocking infection of these variants in an HIV-based pseudovirus assay. As
summarized in Table S2, for most antibodies, the neutralization potency strictly
correlated with their binding affinity for either the membrane-bound or purified S
proteins. 81D6 and 163E6 recognize two non-neutralizing epitopes, located in the NTD
and S2, respectively, and they did not neutralize any of the pseudoviruses. We note that
the B.1.1.7 virus is the most sensitive to the trimeric ACE2 and the RBD-up-targeting
63C7, suggesting that the B.1.1.7 trimer may prefer the RBD-up conformation. These
findings confirm that the detergent solubilized S proteins adopt a physiologically relevant
conformation and demonstrate that mutations in the B.1.351 variant have a much greater
impact on the antibody sensitivity of the virus than those in the B.1.1.7 variant.

Structures of the full-length S trimers from the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants
We determined the cryo-EM structures of the full-length S trimers with the unmodified
sequences of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. Cryo-EM images were acquired on a Titan
Krios electron microscope operated at 300 keV and equipped with a Gatan K3 direct
electron detector. We used RELION (36) and cryoSPARC (37) for particle picking, twodimensional (2D) classification, three dimensional (3D) classification and refinement
(Figs. S6-S11). 3D classification identified five distinct classes for the B.1.1.7 S trimer -representing one closed prefusion conformation, three one-RBD-up conformations and
one two-RBD-up conformation -- and two different classes for the B.1.351 trimer,
representing a closed conformation and a one RBD-up conformation. These structures
were refined to 3.1-4.5 Å resolution (Fig. S6-S9; Table S3).
As expected, the overall architectures of the full-length S proteins from the new variants
are very similar to that of the G614 S trimer in the corresponding conformation (Figs.
S10 and S11; ref(28)). In the closed, three RBD-down structure, the four domains of S1 -NTD, RBD, CTD1 and CTD2 -- cap the almost invariant prefusion S2 trimer. In the one
RBD-up conformation, the RBD position has no effect on the central core region of S2,
but two NTDs, the immediately adjacent one and the one from the same protomer, shift
away from the three-fold axis and open up the trimer. The furin cleavage site at the S1/S2
boundary in these structures remains disordered, and the structures therefore do not offer
any explanation for the difference in the cleavage level between the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351
trimers; the position of a mutation (P681H) in the B.1.1.7 S (Fig. S1) close to the
cleavage site is likewise not well ordered. A very small class of particles in the two RBDup conformation was present only with the B.1.1.7 trimer (Fig. S10), possibly because of
the greater number of uncleaved trimers from which S1 cannot dissociate.
For the B.1.1.7 S trimer, most of the particles used for refinement were in the RBD-up
conformation (Fig. 2A-E). We have proposed that the FPPR and 630 loop modulate the
stability and fusogenic structural rearrangements of the S protein (22, 28). In the closed
conformation of the B.1.1.7 trimer, all three FPPR and three 630 loops are disordered
(Fig. 2F), which otherwise would help clamp down the RBDs. This observation can

explain why the B.1.1.7 trimer prefers an RBD-up conformation, unlike its parental stain,
the G614 variant. In the one RBD-up conformation, one 630 loop on the opposite side of
the shifted RBD becomes fully structured, inserting between neighboring NTD and CTDs
in the same configuration found in the G614 trimer (28). The second 630 loop is partially
ordered, while the third one remains disordered. A similar pattern is found for three
FPPRs, although the structured FPPR adopts a conformation distinct from the one seen in
our previous structures of the full-length S proteins (22, 28). Overall, the arrangement of
these structural elements appears to stabilize the cleaved S trimer and to prevent the
premature dissociation of S1 in the one RBD-up conformation. The three one RBD-up
structures differ only by the degree to which the “up” RBD and the adjacent NTD of its
neighboring protomer shift away from the central threefold axis (Fig. S12A). We have
suggested that the two RBD-up conformation might be unstable (22, 28), leading to S1
dissociation and irreversible refolding of S2. If this suggestion is valid, the small class of
the two RBD-up particles probably contains mainly uncleaved S trimers.
The two classes for the B.1.351 S trimer represent the closed prefusion and one RBD-up
states, respectively (Fig. 2G and 2H). The configurations of the FPPR and 630 loop
follow closely the distribution seen in the G614 trimer: all are structured in the RBDdown conformation, while only one the FPPR and 630-loop pair is ordered in the one
RBD-up conformation (Fig. S11; ref(28)). These observations are consistent with the
nearly identical biochemical stabilities of the B.1.351 and G614 S trimers (Fig. S3;
ref(28)).
Structural consequences of mutations in the B.1.1.7 variant
We superposed the structures of the B.1.1.7 trimer onto the G614 trimer in the closed
conformation aligning them by the S2 structure (Fig. 3A), and detected an outward
rotation of all three S1 subunits, leading to a slightly more open conformation than that of
the G614 trimer. This rotation in the B.1.1.7 variant widened the gap between the NTD
and the CTDs of the same protomer (Fig. S12B). In the G614 trimer, this gap
accommodates the ordered 630 loop that reinforces CTD2 and prevents S1 shedding (28).
Thus, the widened gap in the variant loosens the grip on the 630 loop, accounting for the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.13.439709; this version posted April 14, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

absence of ordered features in this part of the B.1.1.7 map. There are two mutations that
may be responsible for these structural differences. First, Ala570 in CTD1 normally
packs against one side of the FPPR in the G614 trimer (Fig. 3B). The A570D mutation,
with a larger side chain, may weaken the packing and destabilize the FPPR, which is not
visible in the closed conformation of the B.1.1.7 S. Moreover, in the one RBD-up
conformation of the B.1.1.7 S, in which the FPPR is at least partially structured, Lys854,
which in the G614 trimer probably forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl
group of Gly614, flips back in the B.1.1.7 variant to form a salt bridge with the
mutantAsp570. Second, the S982A mutation eliminates a hydrogen bond between the
central helices of S2 and the carbonyl group of Gly545 in CTD1 (Fig. 3C). These two
mutations together allow an outward movement of CTD1 by more than 3Å (Fig. S12B),
thereby affecting the conformation of both the FPPR and 630 loops.
Other mutations in the B.1.1.7 variant cluster in the NTD, including deletions of His69,
Val70 and Tyr145 (Fig. 3D). The first two residues are in a disordered loop in all these S
structures, and the structural impact, if any, of their deletion is unclear. Tyr145 is also
near a loop (residues 144-155), and its deletion apparently causes only some local
changes of the loop. The absence of structural changes in the B.1.1.7 trimer NTD is
consistent with the absence of effects on its sensitivity to the various antibodies that
target this domain (35). Additional mutations, including N501Y, T716I and D1118H,
caused minimal local changes (Fig. S13A-C). They might nonetheless have important
roles in the dynamic process of membrane fusion.
Structural impact of the mutations in the B.1.351 variant
We compared the structures of the B.1.351 trimer with the G614 trimer in both the closed
and the one RBD-up conformation (Figs. 4A and S14). The overall structures of variant
and parent were essentially the same for the corresponding states, except for some loop
regions in the NTD. Three mutations in the RBD, including K417N, E484K and N501Y,
do not produce any major structural rearrangements (Fig. 4B). The most striking
differences are in the NTD, which contains three point mutations (L18F, D80A and
D215G) and a three-residue deletion (L242del, A243del and L244del). The L18F and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.13.439709; this version posted April 14, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

D80A lead to reconfiguration of the N-terminal segment despite the disulfide between
Cys16 and Cys136 that partly anchors the N-terminal peptide (Fig. 4C). D215G appears
to have the least structural impact since Asp215 is a solvent-exposed residue that may
compensate for the surface charge from the neighboring, well-exposed Arg214.
The most consequential changes are probably from the triple residue deletion, as these
nonpolar residues, located on the edge of the NTD core structure formed by four stacking
β-sheets, are replaced with polar residues His245-Arg246-Ser247. This replacement
causes a shift of the nearby loop 144-155 and must also reconfigure the adjacent disorder
loop (residues 246-260), both of which form part of the neutralizing epitopes (38).
Furthermore, Arg246 is pointing towards the side chain of Arg102 near the segment 172188, forcing the loop to rearrange. As shown in Fig. 4D, the segment 172-188 segment
wraps around the edge of the NTD core, packing underneath the β-sheet involving L242A243-L244 in the G614 trimer. The triple residue deletion rearranges this segment with a
movement up to 17Å (Leu180), bringing large changes in the antigenic surface in this
region. Thus, these mutations are likely to alter substantially the conformational
preferences of this component of the molecular surface and to affect binding of any
antibody that has part of its footprint in this region. Additional mutation A701V is
located in surface-exposed region of S2 and caused minimal structural changes (Fig.
S13D). It is difficult to predict the impact of this mutation since the functional role of this
segment is unclear.

Discussion
Transmissibility and immune evasion are independent selective forces driving emergence
of viral genetic diversity. The changes of most concern in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein
would be those that simultaneously enhance transmission, augment disease severity, and
evade immune recognition in previously exposed hosts. Our data suggest that the most
problematic combination of such mutations is not yet present in the existing variants
examined here.

In the B.1.1.7 virus, mutations A570D and S982A lead to an outward shift of the CTD1
away from the threefold axis, thereby relaxing the two key structural elements, the FPPR
and 630 loop, which in the parental strain help retain the RBD in its “down” position. The
mutations effectively increase the frequency with which the S trimer samples the one
RBD-up conformation and thus more effectively presents the receptor binding motif
(RBM) to ACE2 on the host cells. Once one RBD flips up, the fully or partially ordered
630 loops of the neighboring protomers stabilize the CTD2, which folds together with the
N-terminal segment of S2, and thus prevent the premature dissociation of S1 and
inactivation of the functional spike. The N501Y mutation in the ACE2 binding site of the
RBD also increases the affinity of that domain for both the monomeric and dimeric
ACE2 proteins, probably because of hydrophobic interaction of Tyr501 with Tyr41 of
ACE2 (39), as well as a possible cation-π interaction with ACE2 Lys353 (Fig. S15). The
combination of enhanced presentation of the RBM and additional local interactions might
allow the B.1.1.7 virus to infect cell types with lower levels of ACE2 expression than
those of the nasal and bronchial epithelial cells that the virus typically infects; an
expanded cell tropism could account for the recently reported increased risk of mortality
in patients infected with this variant (9, 10).
Residue 501 is outside of the major neutralizing epitope clusters in the RBD (Fig. S4),
and its mutation from asparagine to tyrosine does not cause any widespread
conformational shifts. The N501Y mutation has therefore brought only minimal changes
in the sensitivity of the B.1.1.7 variant to the potently neutralizing antibodies that bind
the RBD (Table S1 and S2). In addition, the mutations in the NTD caused no major
structural rearrangements, consistent with potent neutralization against the B.1.1.7 virus
by NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies. Thus, the B.1.1.7 variant, while posing a threat,
as documented, to unvaccinated or virus-naïve individuals, may be a less serious concern
for those with infection- or vaccine-elicited immunity to the Wu_Hu-1 strain (33).

In the B.1.351 virus, the S protein largely retains the structure of the G614 trimer with
almost identical biochemical stability. Mutations N501Y, K417N and E484K in the RBD

have not led to any major structural changes, but the loss of salt bridges between K417
and ACE2 Asp30 and Glu484 and ACE2 Lys31 more or less cancels the increased
receptor affinity imparted by N501Y (Fig. S15). The mutations at residues 417 and 484
are probably responsible, however, for loss of detectable binding and neutralization by
antibodies that target the RBD-2 epitopes (Fig. S4A). Moreover, the accompanying
mutations in the NTD remodel the antigenic surface of the domain, greatly reducing the
potency of neutralizing antibodies that target NTD-1 epitopes. In particular, deletion of
three consecutive residues in a β-strand forming the core structure of the NTD is clearly
an effective strategy to rearrange a large surface of the domain. The B.1.351 variant was
probably selected under a certain level of immune pressure, as it altered two major
neutralizing sites on the S trimer simultaneously with only a slight compromise in its
ability to engage a host cell.
The global range of SARS-CoV-2 and the consequently vast number of replication events
occurring every day make emergence of new variants inevitable, and substantially
increases the genetic diversity of the virus. In many cases, antibody resistance may
compromise viral fitness, as in the B.1.351 variant, which resists neutralization by RBDdirected antibodies, but also loses the enhanced affinity and transmissibility imparted by
N501Y, as a consequence of the immune-escape mutations. It is also possible to combine
immune evasion and virulence through continuous viral evolution, such as the
identification of a B.1.1.7 variant that contains the E484K mutation (B.1.1.7+E484K)
(40), although this added mutation may alleviate the risk of mortality, at least to some
extent. Such a combination will nonetheless bring much greater challenges for vaccine
development compared to the beginning of the pandemic. Genetic diversity is also the
major hurdle for development or optimization of vaccines against several other human
pathogens, such HIV-1, hepatitis C virus and influenza virus. If SARS-CoV-2 becomes
seasonal, innovative strategies already developed against those viruses may be applicable
to on-going control of the COVID-19 pandemic. The B.1.351 S trimer, which has
superior biochemical stability and novel epitopes, should be an excellent starting point
for developing next-generation vaccines designed to elicit broadly neutralizing antibody
responses.

Materials and Methods
Expression constructs
Genes of full-length spike (S) protein from hCoV-19/England/MILK-C504CD/2020
(GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_736724) and hCoV-19/South Africa/KRISP-ECMDSH925100/2020 (GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_736980) were synthesized by
GENEWIZ (South Plainfield, NJ). The S genes were fused with a C-terminal twin Strep
tag [(GGGGS)2WSHPQFEK(GGGGS)2WSHPQFEK)] and cloned into a mammalian cell
expression vector pCMV-IRES-puro (Codex BioSolutions, Inc, Gaithersburg, MD).
Expression and purification of recombinant proteins
Expression and purification of the full-length S proteins were carried out as previously
described (22). Briefly, expi293F cells (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) were
transiently transfected with the S protein expression constructs. To purify the S protein,
the transfected cells were lysed in a buffer containing Buffer A (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) and 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM)
(Anatrace, Inc. Maumee, OH), EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland), and incubated at 4°C for one hour. After a clarifying spin, the
supernatant was loaded on a strep-tactin column equilibrated with the lysis buffer. The
column was then washed with 50 column volumes of Buffer A and 0.3% DDM, followed
by additional washes with 50 column volumes of Buffer A and 0.1% DDM, and with 50
column volumes of Buffer A and 0.02% DDM. The S protein was eluted by Buffer A
containing 0.02% DDM and 5 mM desthiobiotin. The protein was further purified by gel
filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 10/300 column (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL)
in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% DDM.

The monomeric ACE2 or dimeric ACE2 proteins were produced as described (41).
Briefly, Expi293F cells transfected with monomeric ACE2 or dimeric ACE2 expression
construct and the supernatant of the cell culture was collected. The monomeric ACE2
protein was purified by affinity chromatography using Ni Sepharose excel (Cytiva Life
Sciences, Marlborough, MA), followed by gel filtration chromatography. The dimeric

ACE2 protein was purified by GammaBind Plus Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare),
followed gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column.
All the monoclonal antibodies were produced as described (35).

Western blot
Western blot was performed using an anti-SARS-COV-2 S antibody following a protocol
described previously (42). Briefly, full-length S protein samples were prepared from cell
pellets and resolved in 4-15% Mini-Protean TGX gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and
transferred onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in
PBS for 1 hour and incubated a SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) Spike RBD Antibody (Sino
Biological Inc., Beijing, China, Cat: 40592-T62) for another hour at room temperature.
Alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-Rabbit IgG (1:5000) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) was used as a secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized using one-step
NBT/BCIP substrates (Promega, Madison, WI).
Cell-cell fusion assay
The cell-cell fusion assay, based on the α-complementation of E. coli β-galactosidase,
was conducted to quantify the fusion activity mediated by SARS-CoV2 S protein, as
described (22). Briefly, various amount of the full-length SARS-CoV2 (D614, G614, UK
and South Afirca) S construct (0.025-10 µg) and the α fragment of E. coli β-galactosidase
construct (10 µg), or the full-length ACE2 construct (10 µg) together with the ω fragment
of E. coli β-galactosidase construct (10 µg), were transfected to HEK293T cells using
Polyethylenimine (PEI) (80 µg). After a 24-hour incubation at 37°C, the cells were
detached using PBS buffer with 5mM EDTA and resuspended in complete DMEM
medium. 50 µl S-expressing cells (1.0x106 cells/ml) were mixed with 50 µl ACE2expressing cells (1.0x106 cells/ml) to allow the cell-cell fusion proceed at 37 °C for 2
hours. Cell-cell fusion activity was quantified using a chemiluminescent assay system,
Gal-Screen (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), following the standard protocol
recommended by the manufacturer. The substrate was added to the mixture of the cells
and allowed to react for 90 minutes in dark at room temperature. The luminescence signal
was recorded with a Synergy Neo plate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT).

Binding assay by bio-layer interferometry (BLI)
Binding of monomeric or dimeric ACE2 to the full-length Spike protein of each variant
was measured using an Octet RED384 system (ForteBio, Fremont, CA), following the
protocol described previously(41). Briefly, the full-length S protein was immobilized to
Amine Reactive 2nd Generation (AR2G) biosensors (ForteBio, Fremont, CA) and dipped
in the wells containing the ACE2 protein at various concentrations (5.56-450 nM for
monomeric ACE2; 0.926-75 nM for dimeric ACE2) for 5 minutes, followed with 10
minutes in the running buffer (PBS, 0.02% Tween 20, 2 mg/ml BSA) to determine the
dissociation rate. To measure the binding of the full-length Spike protein to monoclonal
antibodies, the antibody was immobilized to anti-human IgG Fc Capture (AHC)
biosensor (ForteBio, Fremont, CA) following a protocol recommended by the
manufacturer. The full-length Spike protein was diluted using the running buffer (PBS,
0.02% Tween 20, 0.02% DDM, 2 mg/ml BSA) to various concentrations (0.617-50 nM)
and transferred to 96-well plate. The sensors were dipped in the wells containing the
Spike protein solutions for 5 minutes to measure the association rate, followed with 10
minutes in the wells of the running buffer to measure the dissociation rate. Control
sensors with no Spike protein or antibody were also dipped in the ACE2 or Spike protein
solutions and the running buffer as references. Recorded sensorgrams with background
subtracted from the references were analyzed using the software Octet Data Analysis HT
Version 11.1 (ForteBio). Binding kinetics was evaluated using a 1:1 Langmuir model
except for dimeric ACE2 and antibodies 32B6 and 12A2, which were analyzed by a
bivalent binding model.
Flow cytometry
Expi293F cells (ThermoFisher Scientific) were grown in Expi293 expression medium
(ThermoFisher Scientific). Cell surface display DNA constructs for the SARS-CoV-2
spike variants together with a plasmid expressing blue fluorescent protein (BFP) were
transiently transfected into Expi293F cells using ExpiFectamine 293 reagent
(ThermoFisher Scientific) per manufacturer’s instruction. Two days after transfection, the
cells were stained with primary antibodies or the histagged ACE2615-foldon T27W
protein (41) at 10 µg/ml concentration. For antibody staining, an Alexa Fluor 647

conjugated donkey anti-human IgG Fc F(ab’)2 fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch,
West Grove, PA) was used as secondary antibody at 5 µg/ml concentration. For ACE2615foldon T27W staining, APC conjugated anti-HIS antibody (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn,
CA) was used as secondary antibody at 1:50 dilution.

Cells were run through an

Intellicyt iQue Screener Plus flow cytometer. Cells gated for positive BFP expression
were analyzed for antibody and ACE2615-foldon T27W binding. The flow cytometry
assays were repeated three times with essentially identical results.
HIV-based pseudovirus assay
Neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was measured using a singleround infection assay in 293T/ACE2 target cells. Pseudotyped virus particles were
produced in 293T/17 cells (ATCC) by co-transfection of plasmids encoding codonoptimized SARS-CoV-2 full-length Spike constructs, packaging plasmid pCMV DR8.2,
and luciferase reporter plasmid pHR’ CMV-Luc. G614 Spike, packaging and luciferase
plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Barney Graham (Vaccine Research Center, NIH).
The 293T cell line stably overexpressing the human ACE2 cell surface receptor protein
was kindly provided by Drs. Michael Farzan and Huihui Ma (The Scripps Research
Institute). For neutralization assays, serial dilutions of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
were performed in duplicate followed by addition of pseudovirus. Pooled serum samples
from convalescent COVID-19 patients or pre-pandemic normal healthy serum (NHS)
were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Plates were incubated for 1
hour at 37oC followed by addition of 293/ACE2 target cells (1x104/well).

Wells

containing cells + pseudovirus (without sample) or cells alone acted as positive and
negative infection controls, respectively. Assays were harvested on day 3 using Promega
BrightGlo luciferase reagent and luminescence detected with a Promega GloMax
luminometer. Titers are reported as the concentration of mAb that inhibited 50% or 80%
virus infection (IC50 and IC80 titers, respectively). All neutralization experiments were
repeated twice with similar results.
Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection.

To prepare cryo grids, 3.5 µl of the freshly purified sample from the peak fraction in
DDM at ~2.0 mg/ml for the B.1.1.7 protein or ~1.5 mg/ml for the B.1.351 protein was
applied to a 1.2/1.3 Quantifoil grid (Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH), which had been
glow discharged with a PELCO easiGlowTM Glow Discharge Cleaning system (Ted
Pella, Inc.) for 60 s at 15 mA. Grids were immediately plunge-frozen in liquid ethane
using a Vitrobot Mark IV (ThermoFisher Scientific), and excess protein was blotted
away by using grade 595 filter paper (Ted Pella, Inc.) with a blotting time of 4 s, a
blotting force of -12 at 4°C in 100% humidity. For data collection, images were
acquired with selected grids using a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope
(ThermoFisher Scientific) operated at 300 keV and equipped with a BioQuantum
GIF/K3 direct electron detector. Automated data collection was carried out using
SerialEM version 3.8.6 (43) at a nominal magnification of 105,000× and the K3
detector in counting mode (calibrated pixel size, 0.825 Å) at an exposure rate of 20.21
(for B.1.1.7) or 20.50 (for B.1.351) electrons per pixel per second. Each movie had a
total accumulated electron exposure of ~53.40 (for B.1.1.7) or 51.10 (for B.1.351)
e/Å2, fractionated in 51 (for B.1.1.7) or 50 (for B.1.351) frames. Datasets were
acquired using a defocus range of 1.4-2.3 µm (for B.1.1.7) or 1.5-2.5 µm (for B.1.351).

Image processing and 3D reconstructions
Drift correction for cryo-EM images was performed using MotionCor2 (44), and
contrast transfer function (CTF) was estimated by CTFFIND4 (45) using motioncorrected sums without dose-weighting. Motion corrected sums with dose-weighting
were used for all other image processing. RELION3.0.8 and crYOLO (46) were used
for particle picking, 2D classification, 3D classification and refinement procedure. For
the B.1.1.7 sample, approximately 3,000 particles were manually picked for each
protein sample and subjected to 2D classification to generate the templates for
automatic particle picking. After manual inspection of auto-picked particles, a total of
2,325,106 particles were extracted from 27,950 images. The selected particles were
subjected to 2D classification, giving a total of 877,530 good particles. A lowresolution negative-stain reconstruction of the D614 S trimer (22) was low-pass
filtered to 30Å resolution and used as an initial model for 3D classification with C1

symmetry. Three major classes showed clear structural features were subjected to
another round of 3D classification with C1 symmetry, giving another three major
classes. These three classes were joined together and re-extract to do one round of 3D
auto-refinement, following by CTF Refinement, Particle Polishing, and another round
of 3D auto-refinement, giving a map with 271,387 particles at 3.3Å resolution. Third
round of signal-subtraction 3D classification without alignment at the apex region of
the S trimer were performed to further classify, produced five different major classes,
representing the closed, three RBD-down conformation, three of the one RBD-up
conformation and two RBD-up conformation, respectively. The five classes containing
13,919, 77,942, 7,368, 119,338, 41,138 particles, respectively, were then subjected to
another round of 3D auto-refinement with C1 (one RBD-up and two RBD-up) and C3
(closed) symmetry using an overall mask, resulting in five final reconstructions at
4.0Å, 3.3Å, 4.3Å, 3.2Å and 3.1Å resolutions, respectively. Several rounds of 3D autorefinement was done for each then by adding different size of mask at the apex region
to further improve the local resolution. The best map from each class was used for
model building.

For the B.1.351 sample, after manual inspection of auto-picked particles, a total of
4,875,287 particles were extracted from 33,931 images. The selected particles were
subjected to 2D classification, giving a total of 1,380,218 good particles. The lowresolution negative-stain reconstruction of the sample was low-pass-filtered to 40Å as
an initial model for 3D classification with C1 symmetry. Two major classes with
224,988 and 301,967 particles that showed clear structural features were subjected to
the second round of 3D classification with C1 symmetry. One class showing a 3-RBD
down conformation with 124,042 particles was selected for auto-Refinement, giving a
reconstruction at 4.2Å resolution.

Third round of signal-subtraction 3D classification without alignment at the apex
region of the S trimer were performed to further classify, produced three different
major classes, representing the closed, three RBD-down conformation, two of the one
RBD-up conformation, respectively. The closed state classes containing 53,772

particles were then subjected to another round of 3D auto-refinement with C1
symmetry using an overall mask, resulting in final reconstruction at 4.5Å resolution.
Several rounds of 3D auto-refinement were performed by adding a different size of
mask at the apex region to further improve the local resolution. The best map from
each class was used for model building.

For the RBD-up class of the B.1.351 sample, data processing was primarily carried out
in cryoSPARC (37). Initially picked particles were subjected to sequential 2D
classifications within RELION and cryoSPARC on downsampled data (3.3Å/pix) to
give 994,071 particles. Two rounds of heterogeneous 3D refinement in cryoSPARC
resulted in 552,519 particles being selected. Following downsampling to 1.65Å/pix,
subsequent 3D heterogeneous refinement resulted in 503,181 particles corresponding
to the open conformation. After un-binning to 0.825Å/pix these particles underwent
Non-Uniform refinement, including cycles of CTF parameter refinement, resulting in a
final resolution of 3.13Å. Particle polishing in RELION, and further Non-Uniform
refinement including cycles of CTF parameter refinement, resulted in a final resolution
of 2.95Å with no additional new features, compared to the unpolished map.

Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC)
using the 0.143 criterion. All density maps from RELION were corrected from the
modulation transfer function of the K3 detector and then sharpened by applying a
temperature factor that was estimated using post-processing in the program. Local
resolution was determined using RELION with half-reconstructions as input maps.

Model building
The initial templates for model building used the stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S
ectodomain trimer structure (PDB ID 7KRQ and PDB ID 7KRR) for both the B.1.351
and B.1.1.7 variant spike protein prefusion conformation. Several rounds of manual
building were performed in Coot (47). The maps with a resolution lower than 4.0Å
were primarily modeled manually in coot and by rigid body fitting, as the local

resolution of many regions is higher than 4.0Å. The model was then refined in Phenix
(48) against the 3.1Å (closed), 3.2Å, 3.3Å, 4.0Å (one RBD-up) and 4.3Å (two RBDup) cryo-EM maps of the B.1.1.7 variant, and refined in Phenix against the 3.1Å
(open), 4.5Å (closed) cryo-EM maps of the B.1.351 variant. Iteratively, refinement
was performed in both Phenix (real space refinement) and ISOLDE (49), and the
Phenix refinement strategy included minimization_global, local_grid_search, and adp,
with rotamer, Ramachandran, and reference-model restraints, using 7KRQ and 7KRR
as the reference model. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table S2.
Structural biology applications used in this project were compiled and configured by
SBGrid (50).

G614 "parent" strain and the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants derived from it with soluble
ACE2 constructs and with a panel of antibodies representing five epitopic regions on the
RBD and NTD (see Fig. S4A and ref(35)). For ACE2 binding, purified S proteins were
immobilized to AR2G biosensors and dipped into the wells containing ACE2 at various
concentrations. For antibody binding, various antibodies were immobilized to AHC
biosensors and dipped into the wells containing each purified S protein at different
concentration. Binding kinetics were evaluated using a 1:1 Langmuir model except for
dimeric ACE2 and antibody 32B6 targeting the RBD-2, which were analyzed by a
bivalent binding model. The sensorgrams are in black and the fits in red. RU, response
unit. Binding constants are also summarized here and in Table S1. All experiments were
repeated at least twice with essentially identical results.
