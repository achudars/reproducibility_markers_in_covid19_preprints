Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus global pandemic (COVID-19) has led to millions of
cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths around the globe. While the elderly appear at high
risk for severe disease, hospitalizations and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 among children have
been relatively rare. Integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of the developing
mouse lung with temporally-resolved RNA-in-situ hybridization (ISH) in mouse and human lung
tissue, we found that expression of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein primer TMPRSS2 was highest in
ciliated cells and type I alveolar epithelial cells (AT1), and TMPRSS2 expression was increased
with aging in mice and humans. Analysis of autopsy tissue from fatal COVID-19 cases revealed
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected most frequently in ciliated and secretory cells in the airway
epithelium and AT1 cells in the peripheral lung. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was highly colocalized in
cells expressing TMPRSS2. Together, these data demonstrate the cellular spectrum infected by
SARS-CoV-2 in the lung epithelium, and suggest that developmental regulation of TMPRSS2
may underlie the relative protection of infants and children from severe respiratory illness.

Introduction
The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus has led to a global pandemic
(COVID-19), with more than 18 million cases as of August 2020(1). While the global burden of
disease has overwhelmed healthcare systems around the world, available data suggest that severe
illness and death from COVID-19 are rare in the pediatric population(2). One aspect of the
COVID-19 pandemic that has eluded explanation is the striking diversity of clinical phenotypes
accompanying SARS-CoV-2 infection, ranging from asymptomatic carriage to life threatening
multi-organ failure(3–8). Morbidity and mortality appear most severe among the elderly(9, 10),
while infection rates and hospitalizations among infants and children are substantially lower(1).
In a recently published study from China, 90% of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibited
mild symptoms or were asymptomatic(2), and neonatal infections are limited to a handful of case
reports. This led us to hypothesize that host factors determining SARS-CoV-2 cellular infectivity
and viral attachment in the respiratory epithelium may be developmentally regulated. Differential
expression of these viral attachment factors across lung development may provide biologic
rationale for the variability in COVID-19 presentation.
Results and Discussion
To investigate how the expression of genes associated with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility
change during lung development, we analyzed a previously unpublished scRNA-seq dataset
profiling the epithelial and stromal cells in the developing mouse lung at five timepoints ranging
from embryonic day 18 (E18) to postnatal day 64 (P64) (Fig. 1A-B, Fig. S1A-B). We
interrogated expression profiles of genes linked to SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by analyzing a total
of 67,629 cells across these 5 timepoints (Fig. 1C-D). Previous work has suggested that SARSCoV-2 gains cellular entry by binding ACE2 on the cell surface(11–13), then the spike-protein
undergoes a protease-mediated cleavage facilitating fusion with the cell membrane (14).
TMPRSS2 is the canonical protease mediating cellular entry for coronaviruses including SARSCoV-2(14), although it should be noted that there are reports the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may
be cleaved by other proteases(13). Consistent with recent reports analyzing single-cell
transcriptomic data of the lung and other organs (15–19), we observed that during lung
development, expression of Ace2 was generally low, was largely restricted to epithelial cells, was
most frequently and most highly expressed in secretory cells (Fig. 1E), and was expressed in a
small subset of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells. In contrast, Tmprss2 was expressed broadly in the
epithelium and was most highly expressed in ciliated cells and alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells (Fig.
1E). A small proportion of fibroblasts and pericytes expressed Ace2, but there was minimal Ace2
or Tmprss2 in endothelial or other stromal cells (Fig. 1E). Examining the relative expression of
Tmprss2 and other putative priming proteases across developmental time (including furin and
cathepsin B), we observed that specifically in ciliated airway epithelial cells, Tmprss2 expression
was significantly higher at P64 compared to all earlier developmental timepoints; a similar
pattern was observed for Ctsb. In AT1 cells, Tmprss2 expression generally increased during
alveolarization into adulthood.
To provide tissue validation and to spatially and temporally localize expression of
Tmprss2, we performed RNA-ISH using formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung tissue
from the same developmental time points used for scRNAseq, as well as lung tissue from 1yr
and 2yr old mice. Colocalizing Tmprss2 with Scgb1a1 (secretory cells), Foxj1 (ciliated cells),

Sftpc (AT2 cells), and Hopx (AT1 cells) (Fig. 2A), we observed an age-dependent progressive
increase in the proportion of Tmprss2+ cells among all cell types (Fig. 2B). Further, in AT1
cells and ciliated cells, there was a marked increase in relative Tmprss2 expression across
developmental time that was most striking at 1 and 2 years of age (Fig. 2B). Tmprss2 exhibited
relatively low expression in secretory cells although levels increased in adult and aged mice.
AT2 cells showed even lower expression of Tmprss2 when compared with other epithelial cells,
with little detectable increase in expression across lung development . Notably, there was
minimal detection of Tmprss2 prenatally at E18, and relatively low levels in the saccular stage at

P0 in all epithelial cell types. Combining RNA ISH with immunofluorescence for TMPRSS2
protein showed concordance between expression of the Tmprss2 gene and the TMPRSS2 protein
(Fig. S2), and the localization of TMPRSS2 protein expression in ciliated cells expressing
Foxj1was confirmed (Fig. S2). Consistent with our transcriptomic data, basal Ace2 expression
detected by RNA-ISH was low with little change during development and aging (Fig. S3).
To determine whether TMPRSS2 is also developmentally regulated in humans, we
examined TMPRSS2 expression by RNA-ISH across the human lifespan. We defined infants as
individuals up to 2 years of age (n=7), children between the ages of 3 and 17 (n=9). Adult
specimens were from subjects aged 54-69 (never smokers, n=4). Infants expressed TMPRSS2 at
very low levels across all four epithelial lineages evaluated, while children exhibited similarly
low levels of TMPRSS2 in secretory and alveolar epithelial cells with a significant increase in
FOXJ1+ ciliated cells (Fig. 3A-B). Adult subjects had higher TMPRSS2 expression in secretory,
ciliated, and AT1 cells relative to both pediatric groups with very little TMPRSS2 expression in
AT2 cells (Fig. 3B). As with the murine experiments, combining RNA ISH with
immunofluorescence for TMPRSS2 protein showed concordance between expression of the
Tmprss2 gene and the TMPRSS2 protein (Fig. S3). The localization of TMPRSS2 protein
expression in ciliated cells expressing Foxj1, and the substantial increase of TMPRSS2 protein
expression with aging was confirmed (Fig. S4). Human lung tissue demonstrated low levels of
ACE2 expression across in infants, children, and adult samples (Fig S5). These data are broadly
consistent with results of a single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) study of infants, children and
adults up to age 30 that was reported while this manuscript was being finalized, though notably
that study only had 3 subjects per group and did not show tissue validation of their findings(20).
To understand the relevance of our findings in the setting of COVID-19 infection, we
analyzed autopsy specimens from the lungs of patients who died from complications of COVID19 (n=3). Using RNA-ISH, we identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in both the large
airway and lung parenchyma. SARS-CoV-2 was localized to epithelial cells expressing
SCGB1A1 (secretory), FOXJ1 (ciliated), and AGER (AT1). Surprisingly, despite analyzing > 150
SFTPC positive cells (corresponding to AT2), none contained detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA by
this assay (Fig 4A-B). In large airways (mainstem bronchus), SARS-CoV-2 co-localized with
TMPRSS2 in SCGB1A1+ secretory cells as well as SCGB1A1-negative (presumably ciliated)
cells (Fig. 4C), and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was highly colocalized in cells expressing TMPRSS2
(Fig. 4D). Since autopsy tissue likely represents end-stage disease, the surprising absence of
SARS-CoV-2 in AT2 cells could be explained by changes in viral replication during the course
of the illness and/or increased cytotoxicity of infected AT2 cells; alternatively direct viral
infection of AT2 cells may not play as significant role in the disease pathophysiology as has been

hypothesized. It is also possible that SARS-CoV-2 is localized to other cells in the lung that we
did not look for, including inflammatory cells. These data do indicate that secretory, ciliated, and
AT1 cells had the highest levels of TMPRSS2 expression and that these cell types all harbored
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in lung tissue from severely infected patients, similar to data observed in an
ex-vivo infection model(21). Immunofluorescence for TMPRSS2 protein showed localization of
SARS-CoV-2 virus in cells expressing TMPRSS2. Together, these data suggest that priming
protease TMPRSS2 expression may be a crucial determinant of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in the
lower respiratory tract.
The epithelial cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 is dependent upon viral attachment and
activation by cell-surface proteins, e.g. ACE2 and TMPRSS2. While ACE2 has been well
studied in in vitro platforms of differentiated lung epithelium, our findings and prior studies (15–
17, 22) suggest that ACE2 is expressed at low levels in respiratory epithelium (Figures 1, S3,5).

Conversely, the rising expression of TMPRSS2 with age in both the conducting airways and
alveolar epithelium may explain the increased susceptibility to symptomatic infection and severe
ARDS observed in adults relative to children. To date, there have been very few cases of vertical
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to newborns(23), despite viral particles being identified in the
placentas of women who were infected with SARS-CoV-2(24). In light of the very low
expression of ACE2 in ciliated epithelial cells, our data indicate that ACE2-independent
attachment may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry and pathogenesis. CD147 (basigin,
BSG) has also been proposed as an alternative SARS-CoV-2 receptor(25) and is expressed
broadly including in ciliated cells in which its expression increased across developmental time;
in contrast, Bsg expression decreased in the other epithelial cell types (Fig. S6A-B).
Alternatively, recent data indicate that ACE2 may be transiently induced by interferon signaling
to facilitate cellular entry, with increased interferon signaling after initial viral entry propagating
ACE2 expression in neighboring cells(26). Across developmental time in the lung epithelium,
we observed a progressively increasing interferon signature with increasing age, most prominent
in AT2 and AT1 cells (Fig. S7A-B). This raises the possibility that the developing lung may have
relatively less interferon “priming” and therefore have less efficient ACE2 induction to serve as
the primary entry receptor to facilitate alveolar infectivity. In contrast, we did not observe
developmental differences in basal expression of innate inflammatory genes linked to
coronaviruses response including: Irf3, Tnf, Mapk1/3, Nfkb1/2, and Cxcl15 (26–29) (Fig. S7C).
The very low levels of TMPRSS2 expression in human infants, and nearly absent levels
of expression of Tmprss2 in prenatal mice, suggest a mechanism by which neonates may be
relatively protected against severe forms of COVID-19. After the SARS outbreak in 2003,
several groups(30–33) reported that proteolytic cleavage of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein is a
prerequisite for viral activation and host cell entry, with SARS-CoV tropism for TMPRSS2expressing cells in primates(34). Prior work studying SARS-CoV has shown that inhibition of
TMPRSS2 with the serine protease inhibitor Camostat, partially prevented SARS-CoV
infection(35), and addition of a cathepsin inhibitor (Aloxistatin) to Camostat potentiated the
antiviral effect(35).These data highlight the potential for TMPRSS2 inhibition as an effective
strategy for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection, although it is important to note this does not
suggest TMPRSS2 is required for for SARS-CoV-2 entry in vivo.
In summary, these data suggest that developmental regulation of viral entry-factors may
be the primary determinant of the age-related differences in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and
severity. The identification of changes in TMPRSS2 expression associated with age presents a
biological rationale for the observed rarity of severe lower respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 disease
in children, and underscores the opportunity to consider TMPRSS2 inhibition as a potential
therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2.

Methods
Animal Care and Tissue Fixation: C57BL/6 mice were used for all experiments. Timed matings
were performed as previously described(1) and mice were sacrificed at P0, P7, P14, or P64 for
single cell RNA sequencing or lung block fixation. E18 lungs were isolated by removing pups
from the mouse uterus and isolating lung tissue. E18 and P0 lungs were fixed in formalin. P7,
P14, P64, 12 month, and 24 month old mouse lungs were inflation-fixed by gravity filling with
10% buffered formalin and paraffin embedded. This protocol was approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN) and was in
compliance with the Public Health Services policy on humane care and use of laboratory
animals.
Single cell isolation and flow cytometry: At the indicated timepoints, lung lobes were harvested,
minced, and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C in dissociation media (RPMI-1640 with 0.7 mg/ml
collagenase XI and 30 mg/ml type IV bovine pancreatic DNase). After incubation, lobes were
passed through a wide bore pipet tip and filter through a 40 mm filter. Single cell lung
suspension was then counted, aliquoted, and blocked with CD-32 Fc block (BD cat #553142 )
for 20 minutes on ice. After 2% FBS staining buffer wash, cells were incubated with the
conjugated primary antibodies anti-CD45 (BD cat # 559864) and anti-Ter119 (BD cat# 116211)
as indicated below. In the same manner, fluorescence minus one controls were blocked and
stained with the appropriate antibody controls. Cells from individual mice were then incubated
with identifiable hashtags, resuspended in staining buffer, and treated with PI viability dye.
CD45 negative, Ter119 negative, viable cells were collected by fluorescence associated cell
sorting using a 70 mm nozzle on a 4-laser FACSAria III Cell Sorter. Both single and
fluorescence-minus-one controls were used for compensation.
scRNA-seq library preparation and next-generation sequencing: ScRNA-seq libraries were
generated using the 10X Chromium platform 5’ library preparation kits (10X Genomics)
following the manufacturer's recommendations and targeting 10,000 - 20,000 cells per sample.
Next generation sequencing was performed on an Illumina Novaseq 6000. Reads with read
quality less than 30 were filtered out and CellRanger Count v3.1 (10X Genomics) was used to
align reads onto mm10 reference genome.
Ambient RNA filtering : Ambient background RNA were cleaned from the scRNA-seq data
with “SoupX” (version 1.2.2, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, UK) ;(2)) in
RStudio (version 1.2.5001, RStudio, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, USA). Matrix files from
CellRanger were read into the global environment and combined into a “SoupChannel.” Data
from the SoupChannel were passed to Seurat (version 3.1.4, New York Genome Center, New
York City, New York, USA)(3, 4) for data normalization, identification of variable features, data
scaling, principal component analysis, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)
for dimensionality reduction, calculation of nearest neighbors, and cluster identification. The
SoupX pipeline was used for each time point to determine which genes were most likely
contributing to the ambient background RNA. We utilized the following genes to estimate the
non-expressing cells, calculate the contamination fraction, and adjust the gene expression
counts: Dcn, Bgn, Aspn, Ecm2, Fos, Hbb-bs, Hbb-bt, Hba-a1, Hba-a2, Lyz1, Lyz2, Mgp, Postn,
Scgb1a1. For time points that were sorted to select for epithelial cells, the following genes were

added to the SoupX pipeline: Sftpc, Hopx, Ager, Krt19, Cldn4, Foxj1, Krt5, Sfn, Pecam1. New
matrix files were created by SoupX and used for subsequent analyses in Scanpy.
Data integration and clustering. Data integration and clustering was performed using a standard
Scanpy workflow (Scanpy v1.46)(5). Individual SoupX “cleaned” libraries were concatenated
and analyzed jointly. After quality filtering (removal of cells with <500 or >5000 genes, or >10%
mitochondrial gene expression), data were normalized, log-transformed, highly-variable genes
were identified, and percent mitochondrial gene expression and and read depth were regressed.
Following data scaling, and principal components analysis, Leiden clustering was performed
followed by visualization of canonical marker genes. Red blood cells and doublet clusters
(containing non-physiologic marker combinations, i.e. Epcam+/Pecam1+) were filtered. Batch
correction for dataset integration was performed using batch-balanced K-nearest neighbors(6).
Principal components 1:30 were used for clustering and Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP) embedding(7). Leiden clustering (resolution 0.8) was then performed on the
integrated dataset and cell-types assigned based on marker expression profiles.
Subjects and samples: Lung tissue from 20 healthy human subjects was obtained at the time of
surgical biopsy or autopsy, with death occurring from non-respiratory causes. Subjects were
classified as infants (between birth and age 2 years), children (3-17 years), and adult (54-69
years old). Adult tissue included male and female donors, and all were lifetime
nonsmokers. SARS-CoV-2 lung tissue was obtained at the time of autopsy from 3 patients who
died from hypoxic respiratory failure (ages 51, 82, 97). All studies were approved by the
Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board (VanderbiltIRB #’s 060165, 171657, 200490)
RNA in situ hybridization: RNAScope technology (ACDBio) was used to perform all RNA in
situ hybridization (RNA ISH) experiments according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNAScope
probes to the following human genes were used: TMPRSS2, ACE2, SCGB1A1, FOXJ1, SFTPC,
and AGER. Probes to the following mouse genes were used: Tmprss2, Ace2, Scgb1a1, Foxj1,
Sftpc, Hopx. RNAScope probe to the SARS-CoV-2 virus (sense) was also used. Our validation
of the SARS-CoV-2 probe included application of this probe to lung tissue from healthy adult
lungs from a patient who died in 2018, which showed no amplification or fluorescence (Figure
S8). Positive control probe (PPIB) and negative control probe (DapB) were purchased from the
company and performed with each experimental replicate, with representative data shown
(Figure S8).
Immunofluorescence: Using the published protocol from ACD Bio
(https://acdbio.com/technical-support/user-manuals, 323100-TN), we combined
immunofluorescence with RNA in situ hybridization. We used a monoclonal antibody to
TMRPSS2 (Abcam, ab109131) and RNAScope probes to TMPRSS2 and FOXJ1 in human
samples and Tmprss2 and Foxj1 in murine samples. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector
Laboratories).
Image acquisition and analysis: Fluorescent images were acquired using a Keyence BZ-X710
with BZ-X Viewer software with 40X objective. Wavelengths used for excitation included 405,
488, 561, and 647nm lines. Automated image analysis was performed with Halo software (Indica
Labs); an example of cellular segmentation and determination of co-localization is demonstrated

in Figure S9. Cell area of Tmprss2/TMPRSS2 probe was calculated as a percentage of total cell
area for each epithelial subtype. Number of Tmprss2/TMPRSS2 positive cells (defined as having
5 or more copies of Tmprss2/TMPRSS2 by Halo analysis) as a percentage of total epithelial cells
was also calculated. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 in epithelial cells was determined by Halo
segmentation and analysis.
Data availability. Raw data and counts matrices used in generating this dataset are available

and analyses in this manuscript are available at https://github.com/KropskiLab.
Statistical approach: Statistical tests used for specific comparisons are described in the relevant
figure legends. Comparisons of gene expression from scRNA-seq were performed by analysis of
variance (anova) using the linear model (lm) function in R version 3.6.3.
