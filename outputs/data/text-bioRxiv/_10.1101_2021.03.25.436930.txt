Abstract:
Emergence of distinct viral clades has been observed in SARS-CoV2 variants across
the world and India. Identification of the genomic diversity and the phylodynamic profiles
of the prevalent strains of the country are critical to understand the evolution and spread
of the variants. We performed whole-genome sequencing of 54 SARS-CoV2 strains
collected from COVID-19 patients in Kolkata, West Bengal during August to October
2020. Phylogeographic and phylodynamic analyses were performed using these 54 and
other sequences from India and abroad available in GISAID database. Spatio-temporal
evolutionary dynamics of the pathogen across various regions and states of India over
three different time periods in the year 2020 were analyzed. We estimated the clade
dynamics of the Indian strains and compared the clade specific mutations and the comutation patterns across states and union territories of India over the time course. We
observed that GR, GH and G (GISAID) or 20B and 20A (Nextstrain) clades were the
prevalent clades in India during middle and later half of the year 2020. However,
frequent mutations and co-mutations observed within the major clades across time
periods do not show much overlap, indicating emergence of newer mutations in the viral
population prevailing in the country. Further, we explored the possible association of
specific mutations and co-mutations with the infection outcomes manifested within the
Indian patients.

Introduction:
The corona virus disease or COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus has
created an unprecedented health and financial crisis throughout the world (1,2). Since
the emergence of the outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, the novel
corona virus disease has spread widely and has caused millions of infections and
thousands of death throughout the year 2020 and active infections are still continuing at
an alarming rate in parts of the globe, especially in Americas and Europe. As of March
2021, the total number of infections reported in India surpasses 11 million while active
infections are still more than 180,000 causing overall death toll more than 158,000 (3).
Similar to global efforts to combat the deadly disease, various measures have been
taken by the Indian clinical and biomedical research community including vaccine
development (4), clinical trials with repurposed drugs (5), convalescent plasma therapy
(6), and genetic surveillance via genome sequencing of the viral strains extracted from
the infected individuals (7-15).
Several thousands of whole-genome sequences of the SARS-CoV2 from various parts
of the country have been sequenced and subsequently deposited in global databases
such as GISAID (16). Multiple works from India have highlighted the genomic diversity
and the phylogenetic profiles of the prevalent strains in the country (7,17). However,
more than 75% of the SARS-CoV2 sequences (2521 out of 3277 complete genomes
from India) were deposited in the latter half of the year 2020. It is understandable for the
lower number (146) of the deposited sequences during December 2019 to March 2020

as the active cases only started to appear in India in March 2020 only. In order to enrich
the viral genome sequence data for the latter half of the year, we decided to sequence
54 SARS-CoV2 sequences collected from the state of West Bengal during August 2020
to December 2020 making it only the third Indian state apart from Telangana and
Maharashtra to deposit more than fifty sequences in that time period. With these
sequences we decided to analyze and understand the spatio-temporal evolutionary
dynamics of the pathogen across various states and union territories (UT) of India in the
year 2020. We estimated the clade dynamics of the Indian strains and compared the
clade specific mutations, speculated their positive selection and calculated the comutations patterns across states and UTs of India. Further, we explored the possible
association of specific mutations/co-occurred mutations with the infection outcome
manifested within the patients.
We found that for Indian sequences GR, GH and G (GISAID) or 20B and 20A
(Nextstrain) (18) clades were primarily the major prevalent clades in middle and later
half of the year 2020. However, frequent mutations observed within each of the major
clades do not show much overlap, especially for the last half of the year 2020, indicating
the emergence of new mutations in the viral population prevailing in the country.
Interestingly, only 10% of the mutations within the GISAID clades across various Indian
states are found to be common. Co-mutations or co-occurrence of mutations within a
specific viral strain were investigated and frequent co-mutation patterns for different
Indian states were identified. Finally, associations between specific mutation and comutation pattern with respect to patient status (deceased, symptomatic, asymptomatic,
etc) have been explored.

Materials and Methods:
Sample collection
Ethical clearances were taken from the Institutional (CSIR-Indian Indian Institute of
Chemical Biology) and hospital (MEDICA Superspecialty Hospital) ethical committees
for the present study. Nasopharyngeal/ oropharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients
were collected from August to October 2020. Samples were anonymized by removing
patient identifiers except gender, age, and collection date. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids
were isolated using the MagMax Viral Pathogen Isolation kit from Themo Fisher in
KingFisher Flex automated extractor.

standard protocol. The RT-PCR assay was

performed using SD Biosensor COVID 19 kit based on taqman probe chemistry for the
detection of SARS-CoV2 RDRP gene and E gene using reverse transcription in Rotor
Gene Q 5 plex HRM system. Samples with Ct values <= 25 were considered for
sequencing.

Viral whole genome sequencing
Virus genomes were sequenced using ARTIC COVID-19 multiplex PCR primers version
3 by via combination of nanopore sequencing based on MinION sequencer, Oxford
Nanopore Technology (ONT) and Illumina HiSeqX (19). To generate PCR amplicons for
nanopore sequencing Native Barcode Expansion 1-12, protocols (Kits EXP-NBD104)
(ONT) were used. RNA extracted from the clinical specimens were converted to cDNA
using reverse transcriptase enzyme (Super Script IV First Strand Synthesis Kit, Thermo

Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and then purified by using AMPure XP beads. Purified
cDNA was then amplified by each of the two ARTIC v3 primer pools which tile the
SARS-CoV2 genome. The amplified product was further subjected to end-repair, and
barcoded by Native Barcode Expansion kits (1-12) and purified by 0.4X of concentration
of AmpureXP. All samples were then pooled together and ligated with sequencing
adapters, purified samples were finally quantified using Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer
(Invitrogen), followed by loading of 15ng of pooled barcoded material and sequencing
on MinION flow cells.
For Illumina sequencing, samples were sequenced through 2x150bp paired end
Illumina's HiSeqX sequencing system following standard protocol. QIAseq SARS-CoV-2
Primer Panel (Qiagen, cat. no. 333895) and QIAseq FX DNA Library Kit were used in
order to prepare amplicon libraries for viral genome sequencing. Prepared libraries were
then pooled and sequenced using Illumina HiSeqX instrument to generate 150bp paired
end reads.

Genome assembly and sequence submission in GISAID
Two different methods were implemented for the assembly of long and short reads as
obtained from ONT and Illumina sequencing platforms, respectively. All reads from both
the platforms were checked for their quality using FastQC (20). In case of long reads,
reference based assembly was performed using the first SARS-CoV2 strain identified
from China, Wuhan (NCBI Accession Number NC-045512.2 (21) which is identical to
the GISAID reference sequence EPI_ISL_402124 (16)) as reference, and Minimap2
(22) with ONT specific parameters. In case of short reads, they were first filtered using

kneaddata (23) and then assembled by SPAdes (24) using default parameters. Pilon
(25) was used for polishing and generation of final consensus sequences. The
assembled SARS-CoV2 genome sequences were checked for frameshifts using
Genome Detective online tool (26) and their depths were calculated using Mosdepth
(27). All the 54 genome sequences with their associated metadata were uploaded to
GISAID database (Table S1).

Sequence and mutation data collection
We have accessed the protein sequences of SARS-CoV2 virus collected from different
continents from the EpiCoV database of GISAID (16). The database was searched on
1st January 2021 up to sample collection date 31st December 2020 using the primary
key-words ‘hCoV-19’ and ‘Human’. Only complete and high coverage sequences were
considered. Sequences with genomes >29,000 bp were considered complete.
Sequences with <1% Ns (undefined bases) were considered as high coverage
sequences. Sequences collected from India were analyzed separately. Sequences from
different states of India were also accessed and analyzed separately. Additional
metadata for the sequences which include location of sample collection, age and sex of
the patients, clade, lineage, patient status were also downloaded.
We found only 23 sequences collected in 2019, all from Wuhan, China from where the
disease spread. To analyze the evolution of viral clades with time, we divided all
sequences in three terms, depending on the date of collection of sample. ‘Term1’
includes sequences collected till March 2020. ‘Term2’ defines April 2020 to July 2020
and ‘Term3’ includes sequences collected from August 2020 to December 2020. Table

1 shows the number of sequences collected from different continents and India in
different terms.
For identifying the mutations, GISAID reference sequence EPI_ISL_402124, collected
from human sample in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was considered as reference
(28).
Alignment and mutation frequency analysis
To extract the unique representative sequences and exclude redundant sequences CDHIT (29) server was used. The number of CD-HIT runs was kept as 1 with sequence
identity cut-off 1.0 (100% identity). It provided clusters of sequences which are 100%
identical. The cluster representative sequences along with the reference sequence were
aligned using Kalign protein sequence alignment tool (30). Python (version 3.4) codes
were used for extracting mutations and further analysis. Mutation was considered as
frequent when frequency was calculated with at least 50 sequences (N) and the
frequency was ≥ 2.5% for N ≥ 200 and mutation count was at least 5 when N < 200.

Mutational and Co-mutational analysis
For mutational analysis within India, we have chosen states and UTs, which had at least
50 sequences in a given term. For Term2, we found 8 states and UTs. Among them, only
3 states had more than 50 sequences in Term3. Hence, temporal analysis was done for
those 3 states only. We also analyzed how different mutations co-occurred in different
states and terms. Network was constructed for each state and UT showing co-

occurrence between frequent mutations of that state/UT. Cytoscape.js (31) was used to
construct the network.

Patient status association analysis
To correlate disease severity with mutation and co-mutation pattern, available metadata
was analyzed. Based on the available ‘patient status’, patients were classified broadly in
four categories, ‘deceased’, ‘symptomatic’, ‘mild’, and ‘asymptomatic’. Patient status
was associated with frequent mutations, co-occurring mutations, and clades. Fisher’s
Exact test was performed using the following contingency table (32) for deceased
samples,

Results
Demographic and phylogenic distribution
54 SARS-CoV2 samples taken from patients residing in Kolkata and West Bengal were
sequenced using whole genome sequencing approach. The age of the patients ranges
from 6 to 88 years with a maximum peak (24.07%) in the range of 51-60 years (Figure
S1A) with an overall male to female ratio of 1.7 against the national ratio of 1.99. For
comparison we have also plotted the age distribution of the Indian patients for which the
extracted SARS-CoV2 sequences were deposited in GISAID database (Figure S1A).
The quality of the sequencing data represented in the form of depth shows a mean
depth of approximately 26035X and 455X for short reads and long reads respectively
(Figure S1B) while the coverage for all the assembled genomes was above 99%. The
GISAID clade distribution of the 54 sequences is slightly different from the national
distribution with majority of O clade representation and same is true for Nextstrain
clades with prevalence of 20A clade (Figure S1C-D).

Dynamics of clade distribution
In order to explore the evolutionary and mutational dynamics represented in terms of
phylogenetic clades we compared the clade distribution of all the complete and high-

quality SARS-CoV2 sequences (3277) deposited in GISAID from India until December
31, 2020. The sequences were categorized into three time points (‘Term’) based on the
date of the collection/submission of the sequences. Figure 1 shows the distribution of
different GISAID and Nextstrain clades in three time points. It is evident that GR clade is
prevalent in Term2 and Term3 followed by GH and G clades (33). Similarly, Nextstrain
clades 20B and 20A are found to be more prevalent in the latter half of the year 2020.
To compare the clade dynamics with respect to SARS-CoV2 sequences from
elsewhere, we have performed the similar analysis with sequences deposited from
North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Oceania and Asia (without Indian
sequences) (Figure S2). Interestingly, except North America and Europe, all the other
continents show prevalence of GR clade in the second and third term of the year. North
America shows a consistent prevalence of GH clade throughout the year where a
massive increase in the numbers of GV clade sequences was observed in Europe
during the latter part of the 2020. However, it is interesting to investigate whether
sequences belonging to the major clades observed in India through various time ‘Terms’
harbor similar mutations or not. Hence we compared the non-clade defining and
‘frequent’ (frequency >=2.5% or >5 when N <= 200) mutations observed within the
same clade across the time terms (Figure S3). Interestingly, we observed that a
significant fraction of the mutations turned out be unique in ‘Term2’ and ‘Term3’
indicating accumulation of novel mutations.

Curious to see the previous observation, we wanted to investigate whether the
mutational variability within clades is more specific to certain geographical location
delineated by the states and UTs of India. ‘Term1’ contains only 146 sequences from
India, hence, we compared state specific mutations taking SARS-CoV2 sequences from
only ‘Term2’ and Term3’, respectively. Only seven states and one union territory,
Karnataka (KA), Telangana (TG), Maharashtra (MH), Gujarat (GJ), Delhi (DL),
Uttarakhand (UT), West Bengal (WB) and Odisha (OR) contained more than 50
deposited good quality sequences in GISAID. Figure 2A shows fraction of various
GISAID clade sequences within these states and union territory. MH, GJ and WB are
the top three states representing G clade sequences in ‘Term2’ whereas GJ produces a
significantly higher number of GH clade sequences compared to other states. MH and
TG possess maximum number of GR sequences followed by KA and OR. Interestingly,
DL and TG provides maximum number of O clade sequences which are generally less
clearly defined (34). Distribution of clade S is underrepresented in these eight states
and union territories. Comparison of the frequent mutations across states for the same
clade also revealed much more specific mutation than common ones (Figure 2) where
overall only 10% of the mutations within the GISAID clades across various Indian states
are found to be common (Table 2). In ‘Term3’ only from three states (MH, TG and WB)
more than fifty sequences were deposited and similar to observation from ‘Term2’, very
few overlap of mutations were found to be common across these three states (Figure
S4 and Table 2).

Variation in the co-occurrence of mutations (co-mutations) across Indian states
and union territories
Combined impact of co-occurrence of mutations within a specific viral strain could be
crucial to elicit infectivity and sustenance of viral load within the host. Hence, comutation patterns within SARS-CoV2 variants were investigated and specific/common
co-mutations for different Indian states were identified irrespective of clade. Figure 3A3H shows network representation of co-mutations patterns amongst the most frequent
mutations where each node represents a mutation site and the edge denotes cooccurrence between a pair of mutant sites. Edge thickness is proportional to the number
of co-occurrence while node size is to the frequency of mutation. Any two nodes (sites)
were considered to be co-mutated if the co-mutation pair is represented in >=2.5% of
the population size or >5 when the total number of sequences in the particular category
is less than 200. Figure 3I-3J show the frequency distribution of the number of comutating sites for viral strains from different states and union territories. It is evident that
for most of these states and UT a large fraction of the sequences harbor five or more
co-mutations. Although the mutations include the clade defining mutations [e.g., G:
Spike(D614G), GH: Spike(D614G) and NS3(Q57H), GR: Spike(D614G) and N(G204R),
GV: Spike(D614G) and Spike(A222V), S: NS8(L84S)] a large number non-clade
defining mutations are found to co-occur within SARS-CoV2 strains from these states
and UT during the ‘Term2’. In ‘MH’ more than 50% sequences had 7 co-mutations. ‘KA’
also has similar trend. However, for states like WB and GJ, maximum percentage of
sequences contains less than 5 co-mutations per sequence (Figure 3I-3J). Interestingly,
in ‘Term3’ higher number of co-mutations are observed in sequences retrieved from

both MH and TG (Figure 4D), maintaining the trend observed in ‘Term2’. For example,
in TG more than 70% sequences harbored 8 and above mutations within single viral
strain whereas in MH close to 45% sequences possessed 7 co-mutations. WB
continued to harbor lower number of co-mutations even in ‘Term3’ with almost 60%
sequences having 2 and 3 co-mutations per viral sequence.

Dynamics of co-mutation patterns in Indian states across ‘Term2’ and ‘Term3’
Similar to the comparison of frequent mutations across time scale, we decided to check
whether the co-mutation patterns of SARS-CoV2 variant also varies over time within the
states and union territories of India. However, as only three states possessed more than
50 sequences we could compare the changes in co-mutation patterns/motifs for these
three states only along with overall Indian sequences. Panel A of Figure 5 compares the
frequent mutations across three or two terms for sequences retrieved from India,
Maharashtra (MH), Telangana (TG) and West Bengal (WB), respectively. As indicated
before, significant fraction of novel mutations were evolved during ‘Term3’ compared to
‘Term2’ in India as well as in these three states. Comparison between the co-mutation
networks consisting three to five (>=3 & <=5; Figure 5B upper panels) and more than
five mutations (>5; Figure 5B lower panels) again shows emergence large number of
unique co-mutation patterns and combinations for overall Indian sequences as well as
sequences retrieved from MH, TG, and WB, respectively. This observation is further
corroborated when we compared the co-mutation pattern within the major clades (G,
GH, and GR, respectively) (Figure S5). GR clade has large number of co-occurred
mutations of size (n) >5 in ‘Term3’ (Figure S5H) which is consistent with large number

of co-occurred mutations of size (n) > 5 in MH and TG states (Figure 4D) where GR is
the dominant clade (Figure S4A).

Association of specific mutations and co-mutations with patient status
Association of prevalent mutations with the status of the infected patients is a key
aspect to explore the connection between genetic variability and the patho-physiology of
the COVID-19 disease. Hence, we calculated the fraction of mutations that are
predominantly found in a subset of Indian COVID-19 patients for which disease
outcome information is available at the GISAID database. Out of the 3277 sequences
deposited during 2020, patient status was reported for only 806 sequences where 95
were marked as deceased, and 631, 49, 31 were marked as symptomatic, mild, and
asymptomatic, respectively. Figure 6 provides a matrix representation of the percentage
of frequent mutations observed within the Indian patients marked as deceased (D),
symptomatic (S), mild symptomatic (M), and asymptomatic (A), respectively. Statistical
significance of the association of these mutations with respective categories was
evaluated using Fisher’s Exact test (see Methods for details) and the list of mutations
that are found to be significant (p-value ≤ 0.05) are listed in Table S2. It is evident that
there is certainly some mutations [NS3(Q57H), N(S194L), Spike(L54F)] which are
specifically associated with symptomatic and deceased status apart from the usual
Spike(D614G) and NSP12(P323L) mutations (Figure 6). Among them NS3(Q57H),
marker for GH clade is associated with deceased and symptomatic patients in North
America also where GH is the dominant clade (Figure S2). NSP2(T85I) is also
associated with deceased and symptomatic patients in North America but not in India.

NSP12(A97V), and NSP3(T1198K), respectively) are relatively more specifically

mutations (Figure 6). 15.54% of the deceased population and 3.91% of the symptomatic
population of the N. American patients showed NSP7(S25L) mutation while missing in
mild and asymptomatic populations. In Europe, a few frequent mutations like
Spike(A222V), N(A220V), and NS9c(L67F) were observed relatively more within
asymptomatic patients (Figure 6). Examination of association of clade specific frequent
mutations with the disease/patient status does not reveal much specific association.
However, relatively higher (>=10%) association was observed for a G clade (Indian
population) mutation, N(S194L), which was exclusively found in 16% symptomatic
patients only (Figure S6A). In case of GH clade, N(S194L) is observed in more than
70% samples of deceased and symptomatic patients. Similarly, NSP14(T372I), a GH

Spike(G639S), NS7a(Q94L), NS8(I121L), N(P365S) from GV clades seem to be
associated with asymptomatic patients only (Figure S6B). In N. American GH clade
specific frequent mutation NSP14(A320V) was found exclusively only in deceased
(16%) whereas NSP5(L89F) and NS8(S24L) were observed in 14% and 32%
symptomatic patients, respectively (Figure S6C).
Impact of the single point mutation could be essential but may not be sufficient to elicit
pathological response and or variation in disease phenotype. Hence, we thought of
exploring the association of evolutionary selected multiple mutations within a viral strain
with respect to the disease status of the patient from whom the strain was isolated.

NSP6(L37F)-NSP12(P323L)-Spike(D614G)-NS3(Q57H)-N(S194L) were observed in

NSP6(L37F)-NSP12(P323L)-Spike(D614G) is present as either triad or part of larger
co-mutation network in most of the symptomatic patients along with mild, symptomatic
and deceased populations. However, quite different co-mutation patterns are observed
with patients from Europe and N. America where absence of NSP6(L37F) mutation was
along with Spike(D614G) and NSP12(P323L) mutations (Figure S7).

Whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV2 strains throughout the world has provided
enormous amount of knowledge about the evolutionary diversity of this deadly virus and
also contributed significantly in understanding the nature of the pandemic (35,36).
During the difficult times in late 2019 and throughout 2020, sequencing of the viral
strains was one of the primary research objectives globally in order to understand the
specific phylogenetic variations and their connection to the spread and transmissibility
of the virus (37). As part of this global endeavor, deposition of SARS-CoV2 genome
data in genomic databases such as GenBank (38), NCBI (39), and GISAID (16) has
truly facilitate the knowledge to tackle the deadly COVID-19 disease. Here, 54 SARSCoV2 whole genomes have been sequenced using NGS platforms with very high
coverage and depth (Figure S1B). The viral RNA was extracted from patients from the
city of Kolkata, capital of West Bengal (WB) state of India. These 54 RNAs were
collected during the time period of August-October 2020 and constitute almost all the
SARS-CoV2 (except one) genome sequences deposited from West Bengal (WB) in the
latter half of the year 2020. However, the clade distributions of these 54 sequences
constituting the ‘Term3’ repertoire of WB sequences are distinctively different than that
of overall India (Figure S1 and Figure 1). WB ‘Term3’ sequences have significant higher
fractions of ‘O’ clade (GISAID) and 20A clade (Nextstrain) sequences compared to both
overall Indian distribution and sequences retrieved during the ‘Term3’ period as well. As
a matter of fact the ‘Term2’ (April 2020 – July 2020) sequences from WB show
significantly higher fraction of ‘G’ and 20A clades distribution (82% and 83%,
respectively) compared to other states and overall India (Figure 1 and 2). This indicates

that the evolutionary dynamics of the WB strains are slower and therefore may be the
usual fixation of major clades like ‘GR’ or 20B is delayed for some reason.
Intrigued by this observation, we thought it would be helpful to undertake an analysis to
examine the variations in evolutionary dynamics of the SARS-CoV2 virus and its
connection to the spatio-temporal regulation. In other words, we thought it would be
worthwhile to check the evolutionary changes in viral populations prevalent in India
across time and geographical zones. Our analysis clearly shows gradual fixation of the
more prevalent clades such as GR (GISAID) and 20B (Nextstrain) across time within
the viral population extracted from Indian patients. However, the most frequent
mutations observed within the population across three time terms were quite different
and emergence of newer mutations were observed even at the end of the year 2020 for
the overall Indian population as well as population categorized based on their clades.
Similarly, sequences belonging to same clades but extracted from different states also
show little commonality in the type of non-clade defining mutations (Figure 2, 3 and
Table 2).
Further, we also examined the variation in co-occurrence of mutations (co-mutation)
across Indian states and union territories compared over the three time terms. We
observed a large number of non-clade defining mutations to co-occur within SARSCoV2 strains from the states and union territories during the ‘Term2’ and ‘Term3’ which
is consistent with earlier reports based on the sequences collected mostly in ‘Term1’
period (17). Consequently, a larger number of unique combinations among these cooccurred mutations were appeared during the latter half of the year 2020. It is really
interesting to observe that larger fractions of viral strains extracted from states like

Telangana, Maharashtra and Karnataka during ‘Term2’ harbored five or more comutations while major fractions from West Bengal and Gujarat possessed less than five
co-mutations. Even in ‘Term3’ far larger fractions of sequences from Telangana and
Maharashtra showed higher co-mutating residues compared to that of West Bengal.
Significantly higher numbers of active infection cases were reported in Maharashtra and
Karnataka compared to West Bengal and Gujarat during ‘Term2’ and ‘Term3’ (15,40).
Hence, the higher number co-mutations in those two states could be associated with
higher infectivity of the strains prevalent there. In West Bengal during ‘Term3’ only
~22% sequences harbored more than 5 co-mutations while almost 58% of the
sequences were designated as ‘O’ clade known for harboring larger amount of other
(34) mutations.
Finally, we tried to associate the frequent mutations and co-mutation patterns along with
COVID-19 patient status broadly categorized into deceased, symptomatic, mild, and
asymptomatic groups, respectively. Although the number of patient status mapped data
is lower (806 out of 3277 sequences) we thought it was worthwhile to investigate if
some of the mutations and co-mutation patterns could be specifically associated with
those four states of the COVID-19 disease. Apart from the usual Spike(D614G) and
NSP12(P323L) mutations, specific association of mutations NS3(Q57H), N(S194L), and
Spike(L54F) are observed with symptomatic and deceased status of Indian patients
while NS9b(P10S), N(P13L), NSP12(A97V), and NSP3(T1198K), respectively are found
to be relatively more in asymptomatic Indian patients. Similarly, presence and absence
of specific mutation with respect to symptomatic or asymptomatic status were also
examined for North American and European samples for which the disease status was

available at the GISAID database. Although we did not find any specific co-mutation
pattern with severe (deceased or symptomatic) patients but few co-mutation patterns
were observed to be significantly higher in asymptomatic and mild symptomatic patients
(Figure 7). We have also identified presence of a co-mutation triad [NSP6(L37F)NSP12(P323L)-Spike(D614G)] in most of the symptomatic patients including mild,
symptomatic and deceased populations of Indian patients. Figure 8 summarizes the
most frequent mutations and co-mutation network motifs within overall Indian SARSCoV2 samples, most prevalent clades and also for the viral strains extracted from
patients for which the disease status was documented. We observed the top 5
mutations for deceased and symptomatic patients remain identical. Among these 5
mutations, 3 appears in mild and only one mutation (NSP6(L37F)) appears in
asymptomatic patients. It indicates the possibility of association of specific mutations
with disease severity. Similar overlap is observed in the co-mutation networks of
deceased and symptomatic patients. The co-mutation network observed in 51% of
asymptomatic patients is also observed in 20.41% mild patients but neither in deceased
nor in case of symptomatic patients. Similarly, Figure 9 provides an overview of the
dynamics of co-mutation pattern/motif observed within viral strains from Indian
population, most prevalent clades and for three states (MH, TG and WB) for which
sufficient sequences were deposited in GISAID database in Term2 and Term3. It
highlights emergence of new co-mutation network motifs with time across different
states and clades. We believe that our report is one of the few studies that aim to
provide a comprehensive picture of the evolutionary dynamics and co-mutations
