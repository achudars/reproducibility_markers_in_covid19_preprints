Abstract
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) is a member of the family coronaviridae
and contains a single-stranded RNA genome with positive-polarity. To reveal the evolution
mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 genome, we performed comprehensive genomic analysis with newly
sequenced SARS-CoV-2 strains and 20 closely related coronavirus strains. Among 98 nucleotide
mutations at 93 sites of the genome among different SARS-CoV-2 strains, 58 of them caused
amino acid change, indicating a result of neutral evolution. However, the ratio of nucleotide
substitutions to amino acid substitutions of spike gene (9.07) between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and
Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between other
coronaviruses (range 1.29 - 4.81). The elevated synonymous mutations between SARS-CoV-2 and
RaTG13, suggesting they underwent stronger purifying selection. Moreover, their nucleotide
substitutions are enriched with T:C transition, which is consistent with the mutation signature
caused by deactivity of RNA 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN). The codon usage was similar
between SARS-CoV-2 and other strains in beta-coronavirus lineage B, suggesting it had small
impact on the mutation pattern. In comparison of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 with Bat-SARSr-CoV
RaTG13, the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) was the lowest
among all performed comparisons, reconfirming the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 under stringent
selective pressure. Moreover, some sites of spike protein might be subjected to positive selection.
Therefore, our results will help understanding the evolutionary mechanisms contribute to viral
pathogenicity and its adaptation with hosts.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2, also known as 2019-nCoV, is a novel coronavirus (CoVs) isolated from
patients with pneumonia in China 2019. SARS-CoV-2 has a similar incubation period (median,
3.0 days) and a relatively lower fatality rate than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV (1), but it is
estimated that the reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than that of SARS-CoV (2).
What’s more, some laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases are absent of apparent cough, fever
or radiologic manifestations, making it difficult to timely and accurately find out all infected
patients (3, 4). As of February 28, 2020, patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 have been diagnosed in
more than 30 countries, and more than 78,000 confirmed cases and 2,700 deaths associate with
SARS-CoV-2 infection are reported in China alone.
The genetic information of a virus is essential for not only its classification and traceability,
but also its pathogenicity. At the whole genome level, the sequence identify of SARS-CoV-2 was
50% to MERS-CoV, 79% to SARS-CoV, 88% to two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses,
Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, China) , and 96% to
Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 (collected in 2013 in Yunnan, China) (5). Each genome of all
SARS-CoV-2 strains now submitted online contains nearly 29,900 nucleotides (nt), which are
predicted with at least 14 open reading frames (ORFs) (5′ to 3′), such as ORF1ab (P, 21,291 nt),
spike (S, 3,822 nt), ORF3a (8,28 nt), envelope (E, 228 nt), membrane (M, 669nt), ORF8 (366 nt),
and nucleocapsid (N,1,260 nt) (6). Among them, the spike gene encoded a glycoprotein that is
crucial for determining host tropism and transmission capacity, and highly divergent when
compared with that of bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 (93.1% nucleotide identity) (6, 7).
Generally, the rates of nucleotide substitution of RNA viruses are faster than their hosts, and

this rapid evolution is mainly shaped by natural selection (mostly purifying selection) (8). Gene
mutations such as nucleotide substitutions, deletions and insertions have been frequently reported
when comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other viruses (5-7). In this work, we investigated the mutation
pattern of SARS-CoV-2 by comprehensive comparative genomic analysis of the nonsynonymous/
synonymous substitution, relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) and selective pressure in
order to explore their potential in evolution and function.

Materials and Methods
Sequence data
The SARS-CoV-2 reference genome Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512) and WIV04 (MN996528)
was downloaded from the GenBank database. Other newly sequenced 2019-nCoV genomes were
downloaded from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database
(https://www.gisaid.org/). Twenty-one closely related coronavirus complete genome sequences
and their coding sequences (CDS) were downloaded from GenBank database (Supplementary
Table S1).
Phylogenetic analysis
Genome sequences were aligned using MUSCLE v3.8.31 (9), followed by manual
adjustment using BioEdit v7.2.5. Phylogenetic analyses of complete genome were performed
using maximum-likelihood method and general time-reversible model of nucleotide substitution
with gamma-distributed rates among sites (GTR+G) in RAxML v8.1.21 (10). Support for the
inferred relationships was evaluated by a bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates and trees were
rooted with the alpha-coronavirus lineage as an outgroup.

The coding sequences were translated and aligned using the MEGA-X program (11), and
then codon-based sequence alignment was used for further analysis. Phylogenetic analyses of
coding sequences were performed using MEGA-X software. The changes of amino acids or
nucleotides for each CDS sequences were analyzed using in-house Perl script.
Estimation of synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates
The number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS), and the number of
non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (dN), for each coding region were
calculated using the Nei-Gojobori method (Jukes-Cantor) in PAML package (12).
The adaptive evolution server (http://www.datamonkey.org/) was used to identify eventual
sites of positive selection. For this purpose, the following test has been used: mixed-effects model
of evolution (MEME), which allows the distribution of dN/dS (ω) to vary from site to site and
from branch to branch at a site (13). This test allowed us to infer episodic and pervasive positive
selection at individual sites.
Synonymous Codon Usage Analysis

protein from SARS-CoV-2 and its closely related coronaviruses, the coding sequence (CDS) of

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical package (version 3.2.2). The
Chi-squared test was used to compare any two data sets, and data were considered significantly
different if the two-tailed p value was less than 0.05.

Results and discussion
The mutation pattern between SARS-CoV-2 and its closely related coronaviruses
The newly identified SARS-CoV-2 strain WIV04 genome sequence was closely related with
Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45, which was collected from host Rhinolophus
affinis (5). Compared with RaTG13 genome, many nucleotide substitutions are observed, but
there are only five small inserts and deletions (indels) mutations, and the largest insert segment in
WIV04 genome was " CGGCGGGCACGT " sequence, which is located near the boundary of S1
and S2 regions of spike protein. Interestingly, only synonymous mutation are observed near this
insertion sequence (Fig. 1, panel C). Compared with Bat-SL-CoVZC45 genome, this insert
segment is detected as well, but non-synonymous mutations are also observed around it. Then, we
further compared the proportion of synonymous mutations in spike gene between WIV04 and
RaTG13 or Bat-SL-CoVZC45. The ratio of nucleotide substitutions (263 NT) to amino acid
substitutions (29 AA) was 9.07 from WIV04 to RaTG13, which was significantly higher than the
ratio (3.91, 864/221) from WIV04 to Bat-SL-CoVZC45 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2). Moreover, we also
observed that the synonymous mutations increased in whole genome level between WIV04 and
RaTG13 than that between WIV04 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45.
Next, the detailed nucleotide changes of each comparison group were analyzed, and we
found that the T-to-C (T:C) transition mutation was enriched in the nucleotide substitutions
between WIV04 and RaTG13 (Fig. 1B). It’s reported that the CoVs lacking a 3’-to-5’
exoribonuclease (ExoN) accumulated 15 to 20 fold more A:G and U:C transition (14). What’s
more, the RNA mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment will also increase the U:C and A:G
transitions. Consequently, this increased T:C mutation implies the ExoN of SARS-CoV-2 may be
deactivated compared with that of RaTG13.

Furthermore, we checked whether the ratio of synonymous substitution to missense
substitution is increased within SARS-CoV-2 strains. From December 2019 to February 2020, the
genome sequences of 108 strains of SARS-CoV-2 virus have been submitted to GISAID database
worldwide. Compared with the standard SARS-CoV-2 strain WIV04, total 98 point mutations
were detected at 93 nucleotide sites of all SARS-CoV-2 strains with genome sequence available
on Feb. 25 2020 (Fig. 1A). However, only 58 of these nucleotide mutations caused changes in
amino acids. Among them, 15 nucleotide substitutions at 14 sites caused changes in 7 amino acids
of the spike protein were observed. Consequently, the proportion of synonymous mutations (~40%)
among all current reported SARS-CoV-2 strains is similar to that between WIV04 and
Bat-SL-CoVZC45 (39.1%), but is dramatically less than that between WIV04 and RaTG13
(90.7%).
According to random drift hypothesis (15) ， these nucleotide mutations among different
SARS-CoV-2 strains now available are still determined by neutral evolution. In short, there has no
powerful factor to force SARS-CoV-2 to evolve in a certain direction by far. However, we should
take strict precautions against the strong factors that may cause directional variation of
SARS-CoV-2 both in natural environment and infection treatment.

The mutation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 was unique across coronavirus species
To investigate whether the mutation pattern between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is unique
across all coronavirus species, we further compared their alterations of nucleotides and amino
acids in comparison to other representative coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2
and its 20 closely related coronaviruses formed four well supported clades (Fig. 2). The two
SARS-CoV-2 strain WIV04 (from Wuhan) and SNU01 (from Korea patient) were clustered with
SARS-CoV-related strains to form clade 1, belonging to beta-coronavirus lineage B. The

MERS-CoV (EMC2012) from human, CAMEL-363 from camel and RSA2011 from bat formed
clade 2, belonging to beta-coronavirus lineage C. The third beta-coronavirus lineage A was formed
by the representive virus Bovine coronavirus (bCoV-ENT), Murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59),
and human coronavirus HKU1. The last clade was constituted of four representive
alpha-coronaviruses. Notably, the sequence identities between closed related representative
viruses, such as WIV04 and RaTG13, Tor2 and WIV1, SADS FarmA and HKU1 were nearly
95%.
Compared with Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, there were 293 nucleotideswere altered while only
29 amino acids were altered in SARS-CoV-2; their ratio was as high as 9.07. However, this ratio
detected in the comparisons of other human coronaviruses with their similar animal coronaviruses
was less than 5.0. For example, the ratio of human SARS-CoV Tor2 to bat SARS-like CoVs
LYRa11 was 4.81; that ratio of human MERS-CoV EMC2012 to bat SARS-like CoVs RSA2011
was 2.80; that ratio of human coronavirus 229E to bat coronavirus HKU2 was 4.55. These results
indicate that the relative level of synonymous substitutions between human SARS-CoV-2 and its
possible animal origin (RaTG13) is much higher than that between other human coronaviruses and
their potential animal sources.

Codon usage has small impact on the mutation pattern between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13
Different organisms, even different protein coding genes of the same species, have different
frequency of codon usage (16). The RSCU bias will reveal the difference of the host source. We
calculated the distance of RSCU between spike genes of 20 representative coronaviruses and
SARS-COV-2. The codon usage difference (distance of RSCU) of between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04
and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was 1.17, which was the lowest except for SNU01 (another strain
of SARS-CoV-2), indicating that their codon preference was almost the same; the second lowest
codon usage difference was 2.41 that was detected between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and
Bat-SL-CoVZC45 (Fig. 2). The coronaviruses in same beta-CoV lineage B have a relatively close

distance, except that of CoV Zhejiang2013. The codon usage difference of spike gene between
human coronavirus HKU1 and bovine bCoV-ENT sequence have the largest difference, with a
ratio of 41.41.
Codon usage bias in a gene can be effectively measured by determining the effective number
of codons (ENc). Generally, the RNA viruses usually consist of high ENc values which help it in
replication and host adaption with preferred codons. The lower ENc values represent high codon
bias with low numbers of synonymous codons used for the amino acids, and a gene with strong
codon usage bias may have an ENc value less than 35. The ENc values of WIV04 spike gene was
44.38 (Fig. 2), which is similar with those of RaTG13 and other bat coronavirus in Beta-CoVs
lineage (B), indicating the high synonymous mutation was not determined by codon usage bias.

The nucleotide substitutions between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 was affected by stronger
purifying selection
To infer whether the retention of synonymous mutations is supported or hindered by natural
selection, we further studied non-synonymous substitution rate (dN) and synonymous substitution
rate (dS) in spike gene (Table 1). Generally, positive (Darwinian) selection increases, but negative
(purifying) selection decreases the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates
(dN/dS). The results showed that both dN and dS of S gene of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 versus
Bat-SARr-CoV RaTG13 were the lowest among all typical coronaviruses, while those of
SARS-CoV Tor2 versus bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1 were the second lowest. When the ratio
of dN to dS of spike gene is compared, all the tested dN/dS are less than 1, indicating that these
non-synonymous mutations are harmful, and negative selection will reduce their retention speed.

Among them, dN/dS of spike gene of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 versus that of Bat-SARr-CoV
RaTG13 was 0.04, which was the lowest among all comparisons, reconfirming that the rate of
synonymous mutation was increased between WIV04 and RaTG13 strains. Moreover, dN/dS rate
of polyprotein (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid (N) genes were similar with that of spike gene (Table
S2).
The spike (S) protein undergoes several drastic changes during virus infection. For instance,
its large parts are cleaved during infection by cellular proteases and expose the receptors to
activate viral attachment to the host (17). As the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein
was involved in interacting with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, the
RBD region was thought to be preferential targets of natural selection (18). Consistent with this
hypothesis, our results showed that both dN and dS of RBD region are increased in comparison
with whole spike gene region across all the virus pairs used in this study (Table 1). Notably, the
dN/dS ratio of RBD region in SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 was dramatically increased in about 3 fold in
comparison with full spike region. Consequently, these mutations may be subjected to Darwin's
choice and will become evidence of adaptive protein evolution.
To detect positive selection on the spike gene, the MEME analysis was performed.
Significant (p < 0.05) pervasive episodic selection was detected in three sites (48th, 254th, 330th
position using the reference sequence of WIV04). On the 254th position of the spike amino acid
sequence, there is a histidine residue instead of a phenylalanine residue, whereas on the 330th
amino acidic position in WIV04 sequence, there is a glutamine residue instead of an valine residue.
The results described above strongly supporting the action of positive selection in spike gene
during the recent evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13. However, this result should be

addressed with careful explain, because the RBD region of spike gene from SARS-CoV-2 was quit
divergent with that of RaTG13 (Fig. S1), suggesting it might have originated from homologous
recombination between RaTG13 and one yet-unknown coronavirus (19).

Conclusions
Through comprehensive comparative analysis between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses,
we found the synonymous mutations is dramatically elevated between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13
than that of other coronavirus strains, and the nucleotide mutations were enriched in T:C transition.
The specific mutation pattern may caused by the loss function of RNA 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease
(ExoN). Moreover, as the SARS-CoV-2 was supposed to be originated from Bat-SARSr-CoV
RaTG13, the increased synonymous substitution between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strain
suggested the SARS-CoV-2 genome was under stronger negative (purifying) selection. We also
detected some sites in spike protein was experiencing positive selection. These observations
suggest that adaptive evolution might contribute to its host shifts. However, as the RNA mutagen
(e.g. 5-FU) could induce the same mutation pattern, the mechanism of the mutation pattern
observed between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 should be further investigated in future work.

(https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/next-sars-cov2-app/). The non-synonymous and
synonymous mutations of SARS-CoV-2 viruses were highlighted with red or blue bar in the spike
gene region. (B) Frequency of point mutations observed in spike gene. The frequency is the
number of point mutations in each category (A:C, A:G, A:T, C:G, C:T, G:T) divided by total
mutations. The “A:C” represents the nucloetide A was changed to C, or C changed to A. (C)The
illustration of an insertion in spike sequence. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was aligned
against the most closely related SARS-like CoVs RaTG13 and Bat-SL-CoVCZ45.

Figure 2. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of 21 coronavirus strains. The tree was built with
full genome and rooted against alpha-CoV clade. The taxonomic name and NCBI accession
number of each virus was list Supplemental table S1. NT: The number of nucleotide changes. AA:
The number of amino acid changes. RSCUdist: the RSCU distance of spike protein; ENc:
effective number of codons; S ident(%): the percent identity of S protein sequence between
different coronaviruses. The NT/AA ratio between WIV04/RaTG13 was statistically significant
higher (Chi-squared test, P<0.01) than that of other strain pairs.
