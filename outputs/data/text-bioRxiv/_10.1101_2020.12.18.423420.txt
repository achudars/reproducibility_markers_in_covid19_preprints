Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 is spreading rapidly in the absence of
validated tools to control the growing epidemic besides social distancing and masks. Many efforts are
ongoing for the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 since there is an imminent need to develop
effective interventions for controlling and preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread. Essentially all vaccines in
most advanced phases are based on the induction of antibody response against either whole or part of
spike (S) protein. Differently, we developed an original strategy to induce CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocyte
(CTL) immunity based on in vivo engineering of extracellular vesicles (EVs). We exploited this
technology with the aim to identify a clinical candidate defined as DNA vectors expressing SARS-CoV-2
antigens inducing a robust CD8+ T-cell response. This is a new vaccination approach employing a DNA
expression vector encoding a biologically inactive HIV-1 Nef protein (Nefmut) showing an unusually high
efficiency of incorporation into EVs even when foreign polypeptides are fused to its C-terminus.
Nanovesicles containing Nefmut-fused antigens released by muscle cells are internalized by antigenpresenting cells leading to cross-presentation of the associated antigens thereby priming of antigenspecific CD8+ T-cells. To apply this technology to a design of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we recovered
DNA vectors expressing the products of fusion between Nefmut and four viral antigens, namely N- and Cterminal moieties of S (referred to as S1 and S2), M, and N. All fusion products are efficiently uploaded in
EVs. When the respective DNA vectors were injected in mice, a strong antigen-specific CD8+ T cell
immunity was generated. Most important, high levels of virus-specific CD8+ T cells were found in
bronchoalveolar lavages of immunized mice. Co-injection of DNA vectors expressing the diverse SARSCoV-2 antigens resulted in additive immune responses in both spleen and lung. EVs engineered with
SARS-CoV-2 antigens proved immunogenic also in the human system through cross-priming assays
carried out with ex vivo human cells. Hence, DNA vectors expressing Nefmut-based fusion proteins can be
proposed as anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 first emerged in late 2019 in China
(1-3). Globally, the virus has since infected over 72 million individuals and caused more than 1.6 million
deaths (4). Given the severity of the disease, vaccines and therapeutics to tackle this novel virus are urgently
needed.
The majority of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently in development aims at inducing neutralizing
antibodies against either whole or part of virus spike (S) protein. However, follow-up studies from patients
who recovered from previous epidemic of SARS-CoV suggest that specific antibody responses are short
lived with few or no memory B-cells (5-12), and target the primary homologous strain. Conversely, memory
T cells against SARS-CoV persist 11 years post-infection and have the potential to induce cross-reactive
immunity (13-17). An increasing number of studies shows that also SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients
develop robust T-cell responses (18-22). Besides S protein, SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein also elicits
strong CD8+ T cell responses, and a significant reactivity was also reported for both nucleocapsid (N) (18)
and ORF1ab (19) proteins. Taken together, these evidences suggest that a long-lasting, broad vaccine
formulation against SARS-CoV-2 could and should induce strong memory T cell responses against multiple
viral antigens.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a heterogeneous population of membrane nanovesicles among which
exosomes are the most studied (23). EVs are released by most cell types including myocytes (24), and have
critical roles in cell-to-cell communication and regulation of immune responses (25-28).
We previously described the ability of Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -1 Nef to incorporate
into EVs released by multiple cell types including CD4+ T lymphocytes and dendritic cells (29). The
incorporation into EVs increases by approximately 100-fold in the case of the Nef G3C-V153L-E177G
mutant, most likely due to increased stabilization with cell membranes (30, 31). Moreover, and extremely
beneficial for a vaccine, V153L-E177G mutations make Nefmut defective for basically all detrimental Nef
functions including both CD4 and MHC Class I down-regulation, increased HIV-1 infectivity, and
p21 activated kinases (PAK)-2 activation (31, 32). Furthermore, we observed that the efficiency of Nefmut
incorporation into EVs is maintained even when a foreign protein is fused to its C-terminus (30, 31, 33-36).
When DNA vectors expressing Nefmut-based fusion proteins are intramuscularly (i.m.) injected in mice,
detectable amounts of the fusion protein are packed into EVs while not altering their spontaneous release
from muscle tissue. Nefmut-fused antigens released inside muscle derived-EVs are then internalized by
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) which, in turn, cross-present EV content to activate antigen-specific T cells.
These in vivo engineered EVs are assumed to freely circulate into the body, thereby acting as an effective
vaccine by eliciting potent antigen-specific CTL responses (30, 31, 36). The effectiveness and flexibility of
this vaccine platform has been demonstrated with an array of viral products of various origins and sizes,
including but not limited to: Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)16-E6 and -E7; Ebola Virus VP24, VP40 and
NP; Hepatitis C Virus NS3; West Nile Virus NS3; and Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever NP. Of note, in
our hands very low to undetectable antigen-specific CD8+ T immune responses were observed when animals

were injected with DNA vectors expressing the antigen open reading frame (ORF) devoid of the Nefmut
sequences (30, 36). On the other hand, no antibody response was detected against Nef or any of the antigens
fused to it in mice injected with Nefmut-based DNA vectors.
We tested three SARS-CoV-2 structural antigens, namely spike (S), membrane (M), and
nucleocapsid (N) proteins in the context of the Nefmut system. The immunogenicity of DNA vectors
expressing each SARS-CoV-2 protein fused with Nefmut and injected in mice either alone or in combination
was evaluated in both spleens and lung airways. The immunogenicity of engineered EVs was tested also in
ex vivo human blood cells.

Results
Construction of vectors expressing Nefmut fused with SARS-CoV-2 antigens
All Nefmut/SARS-CoV-2 fusion proteins were expressed in the context of the pVAX1 vector (Fig.
1A). The ORFs encoding SARS-CoV-2 S, M and N proteins were from the Italian clinical isolate of SARSCoV-2 ITA/INMI1/2020 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MT066156; GenBank: MT066156.1). Each
Nefmut-fusion construct has been designed to guarantee optimal internalization into EVs meanwhile
preserving already characterized mouse immunodominant epitopes. SARS-CoV-2 amino acid sequences
included in the Nefmut-based fusion proteins are highlighted in fig. 1B.
In SARS-CoV-2, S is cleaved at the boundary between S1 and S2 subunits which remain noncovalently bound in the pre-fusion conformation (37). The cleavage occurs at the furin-like site PRRARS.
We predicted that the furin-dependent cleavage of S would negatively affect the uploading into EVs of the
entire S protein fused with Nefmut. To overcome this limitation, we designed two Nefmut-based constructs, i.e,
Nefmut-S1 (aa 19 to 680) where both signal peptide and furin-like cleavage site were excluded, and Nefmut-S2
(aa 836 to 1196), including the extracellular portion of the protein with the exclusion of the two fusion
domains, the transmembrane region, and the short intracytoplasmic tail.
The SARS-CoV-2 M protein (221 aa) is composed of an amino-terminal exterior region of 18 amino
acids, a transmembrane region accounting for approximately one third of the entire protein, and a C-terminal
region composed of 123 intraluminal residues (37). To guarantee an efficient EV uploading, only the Cterminal region of M (aa 94 to 221) was fused to Nefmut.
Finally, the full length ORF of the N protein (422 aa), except for M1 amino acid, was fused to
mut

Nef .
Nefmut-based products of fusion with SARS-CoV-2 antigens are efficiently uploaded in EVs
The cell expression of the products of fusion between Nefmut and SARS-CoV-2 antigens S1, S2, M,
and N was evaluated by transient transfection in HEK293T cells. To inspect the uploading into EVs of the
fusion products, supernatants from transfected cell were collected 48-72 h after transfection, and then
processed by differential centrifugations.

Both cell lysates and EVs isolated from the respective supernatants were analyzed by western blot
assay (Fig. 2). Upon incubation with anti-Nef Abs, the cell-associated steady-state levels of all Nefmutderivatives were clearly detectable. The strongest signals appeared in lysates of cells expressing either Nefmut
alone or its product of fusion with N. In this case, products of lower molecular weight were also detectable,
possibly originated by intracellular cleavage.
The results we obtained from the analysis of EVs basically reflected those from cell lysate analysis
(Fig. 2). Also in this case, the presence of apparently full-length Nefmut/N fusion product coupled with that of
two products of lower molecular weight.
Taken together, these results indicated that all fusion products we designed are stable and associate with
EVs.
Virus-specific CD8+ T cells were detected in spleens from mice injected with vectors expressing Nefmut fused
with each SARS-CoV-2 antigen
Next, we evaluated the immunogenicity of DNA vectors expressing each SARS-CoV-2 antigen fused
with Nefmut. As benchmark of CD8+ T cell immunity induced through the Nefmut system, mice were
immunized with a vector expressing Nefmut/E7, i.e., a vector whose injection generates a both strong and
effective anti-E7 CTL immune response (36, 38). Either C57 Bl/6 or, in the case of immunization with the
Nefmut/S2 vector, Balb/c mice were i.m. inoculated in each quadriceps with 10 μg of each DNA vector and,
as control, equal amounts of either void or pVAX1-Nefmut vector. Injections were immediately followed by
electroporation procedures. The immunizations were repeated 14 days later and, after additional 14 days,
mice were sacrificed. Splenocytes were then isolated and cultured overnight in IFN-γ EliSpot microwells in
the presence of either unrelated or antigen-specific octo-decamers specific for CD8+ T cell immunodominant
epitopes already described for SARS-CoV, and whose sequences are unmodified in SARS-CoV-2 antigens.
Both sustained and comparable antigen-specific CD8+ T cell activation were observed in splenocyte cultures
from mice inoculated with each vector expressing the diverse Nefmut-based fusion proteins (Fig. 3). Although
the assay does not allow a rigorous quantification of the immune response, the CD8+ T cell activation extents
detected in mice injected with vectors expressing SARS-CoV-2-derivatives appeared comparable to that
induced by the Nefmut/E7-expressing vector we considered as a “gold-standard”.
These data indicated that all four SARS-CoV-2 based DNA vectors were able to elicit a virus-specific

Detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes in cells from bronchoalveolar lavages of immunized
mice.
The induction of a CD8+ T cell immune response at the pulmonary tissues should be considered a
mandatory feature for any CD8+ T cell-based vaccine against respiratory diseases. In general, the immune
response against respiratory viruses leads to the formation of three distinct antigen-specific CD8+ T cell
populations: circulating effector memory (TEM); central memory (TCM), basically residing in secondary
lymphoid organs; and resident memory (TRM) cells in peripheral tissues (39). These latter are considered a

self-renewing cell population only minimally replenished by circulating TEM (40). On this basis, the presence
of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in spleens would not necessarily guarantee adequate levels of immunity at
lung tissues, i.e., the district directly involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.
The here above immunogenicity experiment was reproduced with the specific aim to test the cell
immune response at the level of lung airways. To this end, mice were immunized as described and, 14 days
after the second immunization, cells from both spleens and bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) were isolated
and tested in IFN-γ EliSpot assay. Either pools of peptides to test the total cell immune response, or octodecamers specific for the CD8+ T cell immune response were used. Results obtained with splenocytes (Fig.
4A) fairly reproduced those described in the previous immunogenicity experiment. The higher responses
detected with peptide pools were likely consequence of a co-induced CD4+ T cell immune response.
Concerning the immune responses detectable in cells isolated from BALs (Fig. 4B), quite high percentages
of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T cells compared to the number of activated PMA cells were found (Fig.
4C). Using peptide pools, the immune responses appeared to be increased less significantly compared to
what observed with splenocytes (Fig. 4C), likely consequence of the predominance of CD8+ T cell immunity.
This hypothesis was supported by data obtained through intracellular staining (ICS) and FACS analysis of
cells from BALs from mice immunized by Nefmut/S1 vector (Fig. 4D). After stimulation with the pool of S1
peptides, a prevalent activation of CD8+ T over CD4+ T cells was observed. Of note, a significant
subpopulation of activated CD8+ T cells co-expressed IFN-, IL-2, and TNF-indicating the induction of
polyfunctional CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4D)..
In conclusion, the immunization with Nefmut-based DNA vectors generated a strong antiviral CD8+ T
cell immune response also in lung airways, i.e., the peripheral tissue most critically involved in the virusinduced respiratory disease.

Co-injection of DNA vectors expressing diverse SARS-CoV-2 –based fusion proteins results in an additive
immunogenicity effect
A potential features of the Nefmut-based CTL vaccine platform is the possibility to immunize against
different antigens through a single DNA injection. To explore this possibility, mice were injected with
combinations of the DNA vectors expressing SARS-CoV-2 antigens fused with Nefmut already proven to be
immunogenic. In particular, mice were injected with DNA vectors expressing Nefmut fused with S1 and M,
S1 and N, as well as combination of vectors expressing S1, M and N. As control, equal amounts of the DNA
vector expressing Nefmut alone were used. Fourteen days after the second injection, cells from both spleens
and BALs were isolated and tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells.
When in the IFN-γ EliSpot analysis of splenocytes peptides specific for a single antigen were used,
immune responses of potency similar to those previously observed in mice injected with single DNA vectors
were detected (Fig. 5A). When combinations of specific peptides were added to IFN-γ EliSpot microwells,
the resulting CD8+ T cell activation appeared consistently higher than that observed using single peptides
(Fig. 5A). The highest immune response was detected in splenocytes from triple injected mice tested with

peptides specific for the respective SARS-CoV-2 antigens.
Consistently, the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell immune response detected in cells from BALs
proved to be quite high in mice injected with DNA combinations (Fig. 5B). Also in this case, the strongest
response was detected in cells from mice co- injected with S1-, M- and N-expressing vectors.
The presence of high levels of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in lungs represents a strong value added
for the here proposed anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strategy. More in general, these data open the way towards
the development of CD8+ T cell vaccination strategies against multiple antigens of the same and,
theoretically, other pathogens also.

SARS-CoV-2 N specific CTLs are generated upon challenge of human DCs with engineered EVs
The feasibility of the Nefmut-based vaccine strategy relies on the possibility to induce virus-specific
CTLs in human cells. It was tested by cross-priming experiments carried out by co-cultivating human PBLs
with autologous DCs previously challenged with EVs engineered with a SARS-CoV-2 antigen. In detail,
human iDCs (Fig. 6A) were challenged with similar amounts (as evaluated by the Alix signal detected in
western blot analysis) (Fig. 6B) of EVs uploading either Nefmut or Nefmut/N. After overnight culture in the
presence of LPS, DCs were put in co-culture with autologous PBLs for a week. Afterwards, the stimulation
was repeated and, after an additional week, the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific CTLs was tested in two
ways, i.e., through CD107a and trogocytosis assays.
The virus-specific cytolytic activity of CD8+ T lymphocytes was first assessed through FACS
analysis of CD107a/LAMP-1, i.e., a well characterized cell membrane marker of CTL degranulation (41). To
this end, lymphocytes recovered after cross-priming cultures were co-cultivated for five hours with
syngeneic cells (i.e., MCF-7) previously treated with either unrelated or N-specific peptides. We noticed an
increase of CD107a expression within the CD8+ T cells from PBLs co-cultivated with DCs challenged with
N-engineered EVs compared to those co-cultivated with DCs incubated with control EVs (Fig. 6C).
Antigen-specific CTLs can capture plasma membrane fragments from target cells while exerting the
cytotoxic activity through a phenomenon referred to as trogocytosis (42). The membrane capture is T-cell
receptor dependent (42-45), epitope specific (45, 46), and is exerted by lymphocyte clones endowed with the
highest cytotoxic functions (47).
At the end of cross-priming cultures, PBLs were put in co-culture with peptide-treated MCF-7 cells
previously labeled with CM-Dil, i.e., a red-fluorescent molecule specifically intercalating within cell
membrane bilayers. After 5 hours of incubation, the co-cultures were analyzed by FACS for the presence of
CD8+/Dil+ T lymphocytes. As represented in fig. 6D, and consistently with data obtained with the CD107a
assay, in the presence of N-specific peptides a significant higher percentage of red-fluorescent cells was
reproducibly observed within the CD8+ T cells from PBLs co-cultivated with DCs challenged with Nengineered EVs compared to those co-cultivated with DCs incubated with control EVs.
Through these data, we gained the proof-of-principle that EVs engineered with a SARS-CoV-2
antigen have the potential to elicit a virus-specific CTL immune response in humans. This finding is of

obvious relevance in view of a possible translation into the clinic of the Nefmut-based anti-SARS-CoV-2
vaccine strategy.

Discussion
Both experimental and clinical evidences already demonstrated the key role of CTLs in the
mechanism of protection induced by a number of vaccine preparations against acutely infecting viruses (48-64).
For instance, in non-human primates the vaccine-induced immunity against Ebola virus is marked by the
protective effect largely mediated by CD8+ T-cells (65). Similarly, a key role of CD8+ T-cells in vaccineinduced protection against West Nile Virus has been demonstrated (66). Also in the case of infections of
human Coronaviruses, CD8+ T-cell immunity plays a relevant role in the recovery from SARS-CoV, MERSCoV (48), and SARS-CoV-2 (19) infections.
The majority of current efforts towards the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are focused on
the induction of antibodies against the S protein. Although the correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2
are still unknown, results from studies on the related SARS-CoV indicated that the virus-specific antibody
response was short lived. In fact, in SARS-CoV-patients, virus-specific IgM and IgA lasted less than
6 months, while virus-specific IgG titers peaked 4 months post-infection and markedly declined after 1 year
at best (5-11). The risk of losing this protection over time was further indicated in a 6-year follow-up study
showing the absence of peripheral memory B cell responses in recovered SARS patients (12).
Another serious potential obstacle for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development is the risk of triggering
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus infection and/or immunopathology considering that
vaccine-induced ADE has been documented in the case of SARS-CoV infections (67-69), and just recently
suggested for SARS-CoV-2 (70). Thus, without a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying
protective immunity, many fear that some vaccines might worsen the disease rather than prevent it, echoing
the disastrous effects of the Dengvaxia tetravalent yellow fever-dengue antibody-generating vaccine (71).
Following a prime-boost immunization approach, Channappanavar and coll. showed that CD8+ Tcells specific for a single SARS-CoV immunodominant epitope protected mice from an otherwise lethal dose
of virus in the absence of neutralizing antibodies (72). The same study demonstrated the lack of memory
CD8+ T-cell-mediated immunopathology, suggesting that the induction of these cells was safe (72). On the
other hand, unlike patient waning serum antibody levels, CD8+ T-cell responses against S and N proteins can
still be detected in peripheral blood of recovered SARS-CoV patients even 11 years post-infection (12-17).
Recently, Grifoni and coll. demonstrated robust T cell responses against S, M, and N proteins in 20 COVID19 convalescent patients (18). Circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were found in 70%
and 100% of patients, respectively (18). Another study identified the most part of SARS-CoV-2-specific
epitopes recognized by memory CD8+ T cells from COVID-19 patients in both N and ORF1ab proteins (19).
Taken together, these evidences suggest that a strong memory CD8+ T-cell response should be a component
of any vaccine regimen for human CoVs, possibly in combination with immunogens inducing safe
neutralizing antibodies.

As from previous immunogenicity studies with DNA vectors expressing Nefmut fused with several
viral and tumor antigens, HPV-16 E7 reproducibly appeared the antigen eliciting the most potent CD8+ T
cell response (29, 35). Here, we provide evidence that DNA vectors expressing single SARS-CoV-2 antigens
elicited a CD8+ T cell immune response at least comparable to that induced by Nefmut/E7 (36). Most striking,
valuable levels of virus-specific CD8+ T cells were identified in cells from BALs of immunized mice.
Resident CD8+ T cells in lung are basically maintained independently of the pool of circulating CD8+ T cells,
undergoing homeostatic proliferation to replenish the continuous loss of cells through intraepithelial
migration toward lung airways. In view of the quite high percentages of virus-specific CD8+ T cells we
detected in BALs, it is conceivable that these cells originated by activation occurred at local, e.g.,
mediastinal, lymph nodes rather than by diffusion of circulating virus-specific CD8+ T cells. This hypothesis
is consistent with the biological properties of immunogenic EVs, which are expected to freely circulate into
the body thereby targeting, as already documented (73), spleen, liver, and lung. Upon EV capture, tissueresident APCs would migrate to local lymph nodes thereby switching the processes leading to antigenspecific CD8+ T cell activation. Even if the underlying mechanism needs to be elucidated, the results we
obtained with BALs should be considered of overwhelming relevance for a cell-mediated vaccine strategy
conceived to battle a respiratory virus.
The immune response we observed by co-injecting different DNA vectors appeared reproducibly
higher than that obtained by injecting each DNA vector alone. No negative interferences among the diverse
antigens were observed by testing immune responses with cells isolated from spleens and, most important,
BALs. Hence, the Nefmut-based vaccine platform offers the option to elicit a simultaneous CD8+ T cell
response against different antigens, which were proven to be effective in peripheral tissues as well. The
results we obtained with ex vivo human cells represent the proof-of-principle that the anti-SARS-CoV-2
vaccine strategy based on engineered EVs could be readily translated into the clinic.
The overall significance of our findings would greatly benefit from data of virus challenge, for
instance, on hACE-transgenic mice immunized by Nefmut-based DNA vectors. Notwithstanding, a number of
original achievements has been already obtained through our studies, in particular: i) strong CD8+ T
immunity was generated by DNA vectors expressing either SARS-CoV-2 S1, S2, M or N proteins fused with
Nefmut; ii) this immune responses were detectable in lung airways also, and iii) the CD8+ T immune response
can be elicited against different antigens through a single injection. All these findings would have
significance also whether applied to other infectious or tumor antigens.
Taken together DNA vectors expressing the products of fusion between Nefmut and SARS-CoV-2
antigens can be considered candidates for new vaccine strategies aimed at inducing anti-SARS-CoV-2 CTLs.

pVAX1 plasmid (Thermo Fisher), i.e., a vector approved by FDA for use in humans. To obtain the pVAX1
vector expressing Nefmut, its ORF was cloned into Nhe I and EcoR I sites (Fig. 1A). To recover vectors
expressing Nefmut-based fusion products, an intermediate vector referred to as pVAX1/Nefmutfusion was
produced (Fig. 1A). Here, the whole Nefmut ORF deprived of its stop codon was followed by a sequence
coding a GPGP linker including a unique Apa I restriction site. In this way, sequences comprising the Apa I
site at their 5’ end and the Pme I one at their 3’ end were fused in frame with Nefmut ORF (Fig. 1). Stop
codons of SARS-CoV-2-related sequences were preceded by sequences coding for a DYKDDDK epitope tag
(flag-tag). SARS-CoV-2 sequences were optimized for expression in human cells through the GeneSmart
software from Genescript. All these vectors were synthesized by Explora Biotech. The pTargeT vector
expressing the Nefmut/HPV16-E7 fusion protein was already described (74).

Cell cultures and transfection
Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (ATCC, CRL-11268) were grown in DMEM (Gibco)
plus 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco). Transfection assays were performed using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific)-based method.

EV isolation
Cells transfected with vectors expressing the Nefmut-based fusion proteins were washed 24 h later, and
reseeded in medium supplemented with EV-deprived FCS. The supernatants were harvested from 48 to 72 h
after transfection. EVs were recovered through differential centrifugations (75) by centrifuging
supernatants at 500×g for 10 min, and then at 10,000×g for 30 min. Supernatants were harvested,
filtered with 0.22 m pore size filters, and ultracentrifuged at 70,000×g for l h. Pelleted vesicles were
resuspended in 1×PBS, and ultracentrifuged again at 70,000×g for 1 h. Afterwards, pellets containing
EVs were resuspended in 1:100 of the initial volume.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analyses of both cell lysates and EVs were carried out after resolving samples in 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In brief, the analysis on cell
lysates was performed by washing cells twice with 1×PBS (pH 7.4) and lysing them with 1× SDS-PAGE
sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred by electroblotting on a 0.45 μM pore
size nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham) overnight using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot. EVs were lysed and
analyzed as described for cell lysates. For immunoassays, membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry
milk in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated overnight at 4 °C

Mice immunization
Both 6-weeks old C57 Bl/6 and, for S2 immunization (in view of the lack of already characterized
H2b immunodominant S2 epitopes), Balb/c female mice were obtained from Charles River. They were
housed at the Central Animal Facility of the Istituto Superiore di Sanità, as approved by the Italian Ministry
of Health, authorization n. 565/2020 released on June, 3, 2020. The day before the first inoculation,
microchips from DATAMARS were inserted sub cute at the back of the neck between the shoulder blades on
the dorsal midline. DNA vector preparations were diluted in 30 L of sterile 0.9% saline solution. Both
quality and quantity of the DNA preparations were checked by 260/280 nm absorbance and electrophoresis
assays. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane as prescribed in the Ministry authorization. Each inoculum
volume was therefore measured by micropipette, loaded singly into a 1 mL syringe without dead volume,
and injected into mouse right quadriceps. Immediately after inoculation, mice underwent electroporation at
the site of injection through the Agilpulse BTX device using a 4-needle array 4 mm gap, 5 mm needle length,
with the following parameters: 1 pulse of 450 V for 50 µsec; 0.2 msec interval; 1 pulse of 450 V for 50 µsec;
50 msec interval; 8 pulses of 110 V for 10 msec with 20 msec intervals. The same procedure was repeated
for the left quadriceps of each mouse. Immunizations were repeated after 14 days. Fourteen days after the
second immunization, mice were sacrificed by either cervical dislocation or CO2 inhalation, in both cases
following the recommendations by the Ministry authorization protocol.

Cell isolation from immunized mice
Spleens were explanted by qualified personnel of the ISS Central Animal Facility, and placed into a
2 mL Eppendorf tubes filled with 1 mL of RPMI 1640 (Gibco), 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Spleens
were transferred into a 60 mm Petri dish containing 2 mL of RPMI 1640 (Gibco), 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol
(Sigma). Splenocytes were extracted by incising the spleen with sterile scissors and pressing the cells out of
the spleen sac with the plunger seal of a 1 mL syringe. After addition of 2 mL of RPMI medium, cells were
transferred into a 15 mL conical tube, and the Petri plate was washed with 4 mL of medium to collect the
remaining cells. After a three-minute sedimentation, splenocytes were transferred to a new sterile tube to
remove cell/tissue debris. Counts of live cells were carried out by the trypan blue exclusion method. Fresh
splenocytes was resuspended in RPMI complete medium, containing 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol and 10%
FBS, and tested by IFN-γ EliSpot assay.
For bronchoalveolar lavages, mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation, placed on their back, and
dampened with 70% ethanol. Neck skin was opened to the muscles by scissors, and muscles around the neck
and salivary glands were gently pulled aside with forceps to expose the trachea. A 15 cm long surgical thread
was then placed around the trachea and a small hole was cut by fine point scissors between two cartilage
rings. A 22 G×1” Exel Safelet Catheter was carefully inserted about 0.5 cm into the hole, and then the
catheter and the trachea were firmly tied together with the suture. A 1 mL syringe was loaded with 1 mL of
cold PBS and connected to the catheter. The buffered solution was gently injected into the lung and aspirated

while massaging mouse torax. Lavage fluid was tranferred to a 15 mL conical tube on ice, and lavage
repeated two more times (76, 77). Total lavage volume was approximately 2.5 mL/mouse. Cells were
recovered by centrifugation, resuspeded in cell culture medium, and counted.
IFN- EliSpot analysis
A total of 2.5×105 live cells were seeded in each IFN-γ EliSpot microwell. Cultures were run in
triplicate in EliSpot multiwell plates (Millipore, cat n. MSPS4510) pre-coated with the AN18 mAb against
mouse IFN-γ (Mabtech) in RPMI 1640 (Gibco), 10% FCS, 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) for 16 h in the
presence of 5 µg/mL of the following CD8-specific peptides: HPV-16 E7 (H2-Kb): 21-28 DLYCYEQL (78);
49-57 RAHYNIVTF (78); 67-75 LCVQSTHVD (79). SARS-CoV-2 S1 (H2-Kb): 525-531 VNFNFNGL
(80); SARS-CoV-2 S2 (H2-Kd): 1079-1089 PAICHDGKAH (81); SARS-CoV-2 M (H2-Kb): 173-180
RTLSYYKL (82); SARS-CoV-2 N (H2-Kb): 219-228 ALALLLLDRL (82). As negative controls, 5 µg/mL
of either H2-Kb or H2-Kd-binding peptides were used. More than 70% pure preparations of the peptides were
obtained from Elabioscences. SARS-CoV-2 peptide collections were obtained from BEI resources. Peptide
pools were adjusted at the concentration of 50 g/mL for each peptide, and used at the final concentration of
1 g/mL each. For cell activation control, cultures were treated with 10 ng/mL PMA (Sigma) plus 500
ng/mL of ionomycin (Sigma). PeptTivator NS3 (Miltenyi) (i.e., a pool of HCV genotype 1b NS3 peptides
consisting in 15-mers with 11 aa overlap covering the whole NS3 sequence) was used as negative control.
After 16 hours. cultures were removed, and wells incubated with 100 µL of 1 µg/ml of the R4-6A2
biotinylated anti-IFN-γ (Mabtech) for 2 hours at r.t. Wells were then washed and treated for 1 hour at r.t.
with 1:1000 diluted streptavidine-ALP preparations from Mabtech. After washing, spots were developed by
adding 100 µL/well of SigmaFast BCIP/NBT, Cat. N. B5655. The spot-forming cells were finally analyzed
and counted using an AELVIS EliSpot reader.

Intracellular staining
Cells from BALs were seeded (2×106/mL) in RPMI medium, 10% FCS, 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol
(Sigma), and 1 g/mL Brefeldin A (BD Biosciences). Control conditions were carried out either by adding
10 ng/ml PMA (Sigma) and 1 g/mL ionomycin (Sigma), or with unrelated peptides. After 16 hours,
cultures were stained with 1 l of LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell reagent (Invitrogen ThermoFisher)
in 1 mL of PBS for 30 minutes at 4 °C and washed twice with 500 l of PBS. To minimize nonspecific
staining, cells were pre-incubated with 0.5 g of Fc blocking mAbs (i.e., anti-CD16/CD32 antibodies,
Invitrogen/eBioscience) in 100 L of PBS with 2% FCS for 15 minutes at 4 °C. For the detection of cell
surface markers, cells were stained with 2 L of the following Abs: FITC conjugated anti-mouse CD3, APCCy7 conjugated anti-mouse CD8a, and PerCP conjugated anti-mouse CD4 (BD Biosciences) and incubated
for 1 hour at 4 °C. After washing, cells were permeabilized and fixed through the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD
Biosciences) as per the manufacturer’s recommendations, and stained for 1 hour at 4 °C with 2 l of the

following Abs: PE-Cy7 conjugated anti-mouse IFN-, PE conjugated anti-mouse IL-2 (Invitrogen
eBioscience), and BV421 rat anti-mouse TNF- BD Biosciences in a total of 100 L of 1× Perm/Wash
Buffer (BD Biosciences). After two washes, cells were fixed in 200 L of 1× PBS/formaldehyde (2% v/v).
Samples were then assessed by a Gallios flow cytometer and analyzed using Kaluza software (Beckman
Coulter).
Gating strategy was as follows: live cells as detected by Aqua LIVE/DEAD dye vs. FSC-A, singlet
cells from FSC-A vs. FSC-H (singlet 1) and SSC-A vs SSC-W (singlet 2), CD3 positive cells from CD3
(FITC) vs. SSC-A, CD8 or CD4 positive cells from CD8 (APC-Cy7) vs. CD4 (PerCP). The CD8+ cell
population was gated against APC-Cy7, PE, and BV421 to observe changes in IFN-, IL-2, and TNF-
production, respectively. Boolean gates were created in order to determine any cytokine co-expression
pattern.

Cross-priming assay
Monocytes were isolated from HLA-A.02 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by
immune magnetic protocol. Human immature dendritic cells (iDCs) were obtained after 5 to7 days of culture
of monocytes in the presence of both IL-4 and GM-CSF. Immature DCs were challenged by engineered EVs
uploading either Nefmut/N or Nefmut alone isolated from supernatants of HEK293T transfected cells. After an
overnight incubation, iDCs were matured by LPS treatment for 24 hours. Thereafter, DCs were washed, and
co-cultured with autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) in a 1:10 cell ratio. A week later, the
stimulation procedure was repeated, and, after an additional week, CD8+ T cells were recovered for
downstream assays.

Activation-induced degranulation and trogocytosis assays
Activation-induced degranulation was measured by evaluating CD107a surface expression as
described (41). Briefly, 2×105 PBLs recovered from cross-primed cultures were co-cultivated for 5 hours
with equal number of HLA-matched target cells, i.e., MCF-7 previously treated with 1 g/mL of either
SARS-CoV-2 N-specific or unrelated HLA-A.02 binding peptides, in the presence of both PE-conjugated
anti-CD107a (BD-Pharmingen) and 0.7 g/mL monensin (GolgiStop, BD). The gated CD8+ T cell
populations were then analyzed by FACS for the detection of CD107a-related fluorescence.
For trogocytosis assay, MCF-7 cells were labeled with the fluorescent lipophilic dye CM-Dil
(Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications. In detail, 106
target cells were resuspended in 1 mL of 1×PBS in the presence of 1 μM CM-Dil, and incubated for 5 min at
37 °C, following by an additional incubation of 15 min at 4 °C. Cold RPMI medium containing 10% AB
human serum was added to stop labeling (1:1 volume) for 10 min at 4 °C. Then, cells were washed three
times with 1×PBS containing 1% AB human serum. Following resuspension in complete medium, labeled
target cells were cultured for 4 hours in the presence of 1 g/mL of either SARS-CoV-2 N-specific or
unrelated HLA-A.02 binding peptides, and finally co-cultured with primed PBLs (5×105 per well in 200 μL

supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and stained with appropriate Abs for FACS analysis. Dead
cells were stained by adding Aqua LIVE/DEAD dye. HLA-A.02-binding SARS-CoV-2 N-specific peptides
