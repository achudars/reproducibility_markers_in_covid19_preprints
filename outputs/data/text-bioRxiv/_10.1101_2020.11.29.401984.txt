Abstract
Emetine is a FDA-approved drug for the treatment of amebiasis. In the recent times we
had also demonstrated the antiviral efficacy of emetine against some RNA and DNA
viruses. Following emergence of the COVID-19, we further evaluated thein vitro antiviral
activity of emetine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2). The therapeutic index of emetine was determined to be 10910.4, at a cytotoxic
concentration 50 (CC50) of 1603.8 nM and effective concentration 50 (EC50) of 0.147
nM.Besides, we also demonstrated the protective efficacy of emetine against lethal
challenge with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; a chicken coronavirus) in the
embryonated chicken egg infection model. Emetine treatment was shown to decrease
viral RNA and protein synthesis without affecting other steps of viral life cycle such as
attachment, entry and budding.In a chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assay,
emetine was shown to disrupt the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA with eIF4E (eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4E, a cellular cap-binding protein required for initiation
ofprotein translation). Further, SARS-CoV-2 was shown to exploit ERK/MNK1/eIF4E
signalling pathwayfor its effective replication in the target cells. To conclude, emetine
targets SARS-CoV-2 protein synthesis which is mediated via inhibiting the interaction of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA with eIF4E. This is a novel mechanistic insight on the antiviral
efficacy of emetine. In vitro antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and its ability to
protect chicken embryos against IBV suggests that emetine could be repurposed to
treat COVID-19.

1. Introduction
The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has become a health emergency of
international concern. Therapeutic agents that can be used against COVID-19 or other
coronavirus diseases are unavailable.Emetine dihydrochloride hydrate or emetine isa
natural alkaloid found in three plant families:Alangiaceae, Icacinaceae, and Rubiaceae.
Emetine is a FDA-approved drug for the treatment of amebiasis(Bleasel and
Peterson, 2020).
Emetine has beenshownto disrupt protein synthesis in mammalian, yeast and plant
cells (Grollman, 1966, 1968; Gupta and Siminovitch, 1976; Han et al., 2014; Jimenez et
al., 1977; Smirnova et al., 2003). Recent studies by our and other groups have
suggested in vitroantiviral efficacy of emetine against some RNA and DNA viruses
(Chaves Valadao et al., 2015; Choy et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2007; Khandelwal et al.,
2017; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016; Ramabhadran and Thach, 1980; Yang et al.,
2018).Emetine can directly inhibit viral polymerase (Chaves Valadao et al., 2015;
Khandelwal et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018), although the major antiviral activity of
emetine is believed to be mediated via targeting certain cellular factors (Khandelwal et
al., 2017). While most studies are based on simply measuring the reduction in virus
yield in the cell culture system, some mechanistic insights of emetine action have also
been provided. For instance, in a study on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), emetine
was shown to target themouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2)-p53 interaction, which
is required for efficient HCMV replication (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016). However, the

precise natures of the cellular factors targeted by emetine and their roles in viral life
cycle remain unknown. In this study, weprovide some novel mechanistic insights on the
antiviral efficacy of emetine againstSARS-CoV-2, besides evaluating its protective
efficacy against lethal challenge with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, a chicken
coronavirus) in embryonated chicken eggs.

2.4.

Determination of the cytotoxicity of emetine in Vero cells

The cytotoxicity (Kumar et al., 2008)of emetine in Vero cells was determined by MTT
assay as described previously by our group(Khandelwal et al., 2017).
2.5.

Determination of the lethal dose 50 (LD50) of emetine in embryonated chicken

eggs
To determine LD50, 100 l of 5-fold serial dilutions (5000-0.32 ng/egg) of emetine (5
μ

eggs/dilution) or equal volumes of PBS (vehicle control)were injected in SPF
embryonated chicken eggs via allantoic route. The eggs were observed daily for
mortality of the embryos. The LD50 was determined by Reed-Muench method.
2.6.

In ovo antiviral efficacy of emetine against IBV

SPF embryonated chicken eggs, in quadruplets, were inoculated with 5-fold serial
dilutions of emetine (100-0.8 ng/egg in 100 l PBS)via allantoicroute and subsequently
μ

infected with IBVategg infective dose 50 (EID50) of 100. The eggs were visualizeddaily
for up to 6 days post-inoculation for mortality of the embryos. Effective concentration 50
(EC50) was determined by the Reed-Muench method.
2.7.

Attachment assay

Vero cells, in triplicates were pre-incubated with 500 nM emetine or equivalent
volume of PBS for 1 h and then infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI of 5 for 2 h at 4°C.
The cells were then washed 5 times with PBS and the cell lysates were prepared by
rapid freeze-thaw method. The viral titres were determined by plaque assay.

2.8.

Entry assay

The effect of emetine on SARS-CoV-2 entry was assessed using a previously
described assay (Khandelwal et al., 2014). Briefly, Vero cell monolayers (in triplicates)
were pre-chilled to 4oC and infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI of 5 in the emetine-free
medium for 1 h at 4oC to permit attachment. This was followed by washing and addition
of fresh MEM containing the drug or its vehicle-control. Entry was allowed to proceed at
37oC for 1 h after which the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with
MEMwithout any drug. The progeny virus particles released in the infected cell culture
supernatant at 16 h were titrated by plaque assay.
2.9.

Quantitative real-time PCR (RNA synthesis)

The levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the infected cells were quantified by quantitative
real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Viral RNA was extracted by QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cDNA was synthesized as per the protocol described by the
manufacturer (Fermentas, Hanover, USA) using either oligo dT or random hexamer
primers. qRT-PCR was carried out with a 25 µl reaction mixture containing gene specific
primers, template and iTaq™ Universal SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, USA) and
run on QuantStudio™ 3 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Massachusetts, USA). Thermalcycler conditions were as follows: a denaturation step of
5 min at 950C followed by 40 cycles of amplification (30 s at 950C, 30 s at 590C, and 300
s at 720C). The levels of viral RNA, expressed as threshold cycle (CT) values, were
analyzed to determine relative fold change in SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers (E
gene) as described previously (Kumar et al., 2016). The primers used for amplification

of SARS-CoV-2 E gene were as follows: [forward primer: 5’ACCGACGACGACTACTAGCG-3’and reverse primer: 5’AGCTCTTCAACGGTAATAGTACCG-3’.
2.10. Virus release assay
Confluent monolayers of Vero cells, in triplicates, were infected with SARS-CoV-2
for 1 h at MOI of 5, followed by washing with PBS and addition of fresh MEM. At 10 hpi,
cells were washed 5 times with chilled PBS followed by addition of fresh MEM
containing 500nM emetine or PBS. Virus release at various time points (post-emetine
addition) was quantified by plaque assay.
2.11. Western blot analysis
Confluent monolayers of Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI of 5for
1h, followed by washing with PBS and addition of fresh MEM. Cell lysates were
prepared at 12 hpi in RIPA buffer (Kumar et al., 2011)and subjected to Western blot
analysis to probe the viral/cellularproteins.
2.12. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assay
CHIP assay was carried out to evaluate the interaction of viral mRNA with a cellular
cap-binding protein (eIF4E) as per the previously described method (Bier et al., 2011;
Carey et al., 2009) with some modifications. Briefly, Vero cells, in triplicates were
infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI of 5. At 10hpi, when the RNA levels were expected to
be at its peak, the cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min to covalently
cross-link interacting proteins and nucleic acid. Thereafter, the cross-linking reaction

was stopped by addition of 125 mM glycine (final concentration) followed by washing
the cells with ice-cold PBS. The cells lysates were prepared in immunoprecipitation (IP)
buffer [150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 1% Triton X100 plus protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail] and sonicated in a Qsonica
Sonicator Q500 (Qsonica, Newtown, CT, USA)(6 pulse of 15 sec at amplitude of 40%).
The cell lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000g. The clarified cell
lysateswere mixed with 10 units of RiboLock RNase Inhibitor (Thermo Scientific, USA)
and then incubated with the phospho-eIF4E antibody (reactive antibody),phospho ERK
antibody (nonreactive antibody) or equivalent volume of IP buffer (beads control) for 45
minutes at room temperature. Thereafter,40µl (5 ng/µl) of Protein A Sepharose® slurry,
prepared as per the instruction of manufacturer (Abcam, USA) was added into each
reaction and incubated overnight at 40C on a rotary platform. The beads were then
washed 5 times in IP buffer (without protease inhibitors). To reverse the cross-linking,
the complexes were then incubated withProteinase K (20mg/ml final concentration) at
560C for 40 minutes. Finally, the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 12,000g for 1 min
and the supernatant was subjected to cDNA preparation and quantitation of SARS-CoV2 RNA (E gene) by qRT-PCR.
3. Results

ofemetine on cell free virions (virucidal effect), infectious virions were incubated with
indicated concentrations of emetine which wasfollowed by determination of theresidual
infectivityof SARS-CoV-2 virions by plaque assay. As shown in Fig. 2b,viral titres were
comparable in the emetine and vehicle control-treated groups which suggestedthat
emetine has no virucidal effect on the cell-free SARS-CoV-2 virions. To determine thein
vitroantiviral efficacy of emetine, the yields of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virionswere
measured in the presence of various non-cytotoxic concentrations of emetineor vehiclecontrol.Emetine was found to decrease the SARS-CoV-2 replication (Fig. 2c)in a dosedependent manner. The EC50 was determined to be 0.147 nM. The selective index
(CC50/EC50) was calculated to be 10910.4.
3.2.

In ovo antiviral efficacy of emetine against IBV

Anti-coronavirus potential of emetine was further evaluated in ovoby virulent IBV
challenge in an embryonated chicken egg infection model. Initially, we determined the
lethal dose of emetine by inoculating SPF embryonated chicken eggs with serial
dilutions of emetine. As shown in Fig. 3a, mortality of the embryo was observed at
emetine concentration 200 ng/egg but not at the lower concentrations. The LD50 was
≥

determined to be 365.7 ng/egg.
For evaluation of in ovoanti-IBV efficacy of emetine, eggs were infected with IBV
along with the indicated concentrations of emetine. As shown in Fig. 3b, emetine
prevented the chicken embryos against lethal IBV challenge in a dosedependentmanner. No mortalities were observed at emetine concentration of 20 ng
≥

whereas a partial (significant) protection was obtained up to 4 ng. Besides, emetine

administration also resulted in normal development of embryos as compared to vehiclecontrol-treated group wherein stunted growth and defective feather development was
observed (Fig. 3c).At an EC50 of 2.3 ng/egg, the therapeutic index (LD50/EC50) of
emetine was determined to be 159.1. Taken together, we conclude that emetine
prevents the chicken embryos against lethal challenge with IBV.
3.3.

Emetinedoes not affect attachment, entry and release of SARS-CoV-2

In order to evaluate which specific step(s) of SARS-CoV-2 are affected by emetine,
we first determined the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2in one-step growth curve wherein Vero
cells were infected with high multiplicity of infection (MOI=5) followed by quantification of
the virus released in the infected cell culture supernatant at different times postinfection. As shown in Fig. 4a, the virus titres were comparable at 1 hpi, 2 hpi or 4 hpi.
However, a sharp rise in the viral titres was observed at 8 hpi. This was presumably due
to the production of new progeny virus particles and hencesuggestive of the completion
of viral life cycle. After 8 hpi viz; 10 hpi and 12 hpi, the virus entered intothe stationary
phase(Fig. 4a). Keeping these results in view and in agreement with others (Keyaerts
et al., 2005), the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 was determined to be 8-10 h in Vero cells.
Typically, the receptor-virus interactions are specific and the binding
is independent of energy or temperature. The attachmentassay was carried out at 4oC
which allowed only attachment but restricted other post-attachment steps of the viral life
cycle which are energy and temperature dependent. As shown in (Fig. 4b), we did not
observe any significant difference in the viral tittersattached in the presence of emetine
or vehicle-control. In order to determine whetherthe pre-attached virus was able to enter

the cells in the presence of emetine, a standard entry assay was also performed.
Emetine was not shown to affect viral entry as the viral titres were comparable between
emetine-treated and vehicle-control-treated cells (Fig. 4c). To determine the effect of
emetine on virus release (budding), it was applied at the time when the virus was
presumed to be completing its life cycle viz; ~10 hpi. As shown in Fig. 4d,no significant
difference in the viral titres was observed between emetine-treated and control-treated
cells, suggesting that emetine does not affect SARS-CoV-2 release from the infected
cells.
3.4.

Emetine treatment reduces SARS-CoV-2 RNA and proteins synthesis

In order to determinethe effect of emetine on the synthesis of viral genome, we first
evaluated the kinetics of the viral RNA synthesis in the infected cells (cell pellet). As
shown in Fig. 5a, the amount of viral RNA in the infected cell pellet was comparable at
1 hpi, 2 hpi, 4 hpi and 6 hpi. The detectable amounts of viral RNA at these early time
points represent the virus particles which entered in the target cells following infection
(input). A sharp rise in the viral RNA was observed at 8 hpi which peaked at 10 hpi
before declining sharply at 12 hpi (Fig. 5a).
To evaluate the effect of emetine on synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, emetine was
applied when early steps of the virus life cycle (attachment/entry) were expected to
occur (~4hpi) and the cells were harvested when the levels of viral RNA were expected
to be maximum (~10 hpi, Fig. 5a). As shown in Fig. 5b, a highly significantreduction in
the relative copy numbers of viral RNAas well as viral mRNA was observed in emetine-

treated cells whichsuggestedthat emetine could affect viral genome synthesis in
infected cells.
Emetine-induced decreasedsynthesis of viral genome could be due to the reduced
synthesis of viral proteins (viral polymerase and other accessory proteins required for
virus replication).Nevertheless, Western blot analysis of cells infected withSARS-CoV-2
(Fig. 5c, upper panel) showed decreased levels of viral proteins in the presence of
emetine. However, there were similar levels of cellular housekeeping proteinGAPDH in
emetine-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 5c, lowerpanel)which suggested that emetine
does not lead to a general shut off /inhibitionof cellular protein synthesis(at least at the
concentration we employed).
3.5.

Emetine inhibits interaction of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA and cellular eIF4E

We further explored the possible inhibitory mechanism of emetine in suppressingthe
synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 proteins.In coronaviruses, viral mRNA translation takes place
in a cap-dependent manner wherein the eIF4E plays a central role in the initiation of
translation(Cencic et al., 2011; Gordon et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2018; Müller et al.,
2018). Upon activation (phosphorylation) by upstream kinase(s), elF4E binds to 5 cap
′

of mRNA to initiate translation (Kumar et al., 2018). We first evaluated the impact of the
inhibition of eIF4E activity on SARS-CoV-2 replication. As shown in Fig. 6a,at a noncytotoxic concentration [(0.5 µg/ml, determined previously by our group (Khandelwal et
al., 2020)], addition of 4EGI-1 resulted in a highly significant reduction invirus yield(Fig.
6a)whichsuggested that eIF4E is essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication.

Next we evaluated if emetine inhibits interaction of the viral RNAwith eIF4E (capbinding protein). At 10 hpi when SARS-CoV-2 RNA was expected to be at its peak level,
cells were covalently cross-linked and evaluated for viral RNA and eIF4E interaction in a
CHIP assay. As shown in Fig. 6b, -eIF4E (reactive antibody) but not -ERK (nonα

α

reactive antibody) or beads control immunoprecipitated SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The levels
of viral RNA immunoprecipitated by -eIF4E were >99.9% lower in emetine-treated cells
α

as compared to the PBS-treated cells (Fig. 6b) which confirmed that emetine inhibits
eIF4E/SARS-CoV-2 mRNA interaction. In qRT-PCR, the levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in
-ERK-treated (but not -eIF4E-treated cell aliquots) were undetectable (Ct values

undetermined) which suggested that -eIF4E specifically interacted with SARS-CoV-2
α

RNA(Fig. 6b).
3.6. ERK/MNK1/eIF4E cell signalling pathway is prerequisite for SARS-CoV-2
replication
eIF4E is activated via RTK/ERK/MNK1 signalling axis (Kumar et al., 2018).As shown
in Fig. 7,in addition to the inhibitory effect of eIF4E inhibitor, at a non-cytotoxic
concentration, addition of the inhibitors targetingupstream eIF4E kinases such asMNK1
(CGP57380: 0.5 µg/ml) and ERK (FR180204: 0.2 µg/ml) also resulted in decreased
SARS-CoV-2 replication suggesting that the ERK/MNK1/eIF4E signalling is prerequisite
for SARS-CoV-2 replication. The CC50 values of eIF4E, Apigenin, CGP57380 and
FR180204 in Vero cells has been described previously by our groups (Khandelwal et
al., 2020). Apigenin, a dietary flavanoid was previously shown to decrease eIF4E
phosphorylation in buffalopox virus (BPXV) infected Vero cells(Khandelwal et al.,

2020).Addition of a non-cytotoxic concentration (2.5µg/ml) of Apigenin resulted in
reduced production ofSARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells (Fig. 7) which further confirmed the
virus supportive role of eIF4E in SARS-CoV-2 replication.
4. Discussion
We along with some other groups have demonstrated thein vitro antiviral efficacy of
emetine against some RNA and DNA viruses (Chaves Valadao et al., 2015; Choy et
al., 2020; Deng et al., 2007; Khandelwal et al., 2017; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016;
Ramabhadran and Thach, 1980). While the development of entirely new antiviral drugs
may take several months or even years, repurposing the existing approved drugs could
save time and a lot of investments. Following the emergence of COVID-19, we
evaluated thein vitro antiviral activity of emetine against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we
have provided some novel mechanistic insights on the antiviral efficacy of emetine
against SARS-CoV-2, besides analysingthe antiviral potential of emetine againsta lethal
challenge with IBV for the first time.
Emetine inhibits protein synthesis in mammalian cells. A non-cytotoxic concentration
of emetine is also known to inhibit the replication of certainviruses. While most of the
studies on the inhibitory effect of emetine on virus replication are simply based on
measuring the virus yields in cell culture(Choy et al., 2020; Ramabhadran and Thach,
1980; Yang et al., 2018),somemechanistic insights have also been provided. Emetine
can directly inhibit viral polymerase(Chaves Valadao et al., 2015; Khandelwal et al.,
2017; Yang et al., 2018), although the major antiviral activity of emetine is believed to
be mediated via targeting certain cellular factors (Khandelwal et al., 2017). Depending

on the nature of the virus involved, emetine could target different step(s) of virus
replication cycle. For instance, in Zika virus (ZIKV), emetine was shown to inhibit NS5
polymerase activity, besides inhibiting viral entry (mediated via disruption of lysosomal
functions)(Yang et al., 2018). In human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, emetine was
shown to inhibit HCMV replication after entry but before initiation of DNA
synthesis(Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016). Likewise, in rabies virus, emetine was also
shown to block the axonal transport of the virus particles (MacGibeny et al., 2018).
Similarly, in vaccinia virus, it was shown to interfere with the virus assembly (Deng et
al., 2007). Most of these studies provide insights on the inhibitory effect of emetine on
the specific step(s) of viral life cycle. However, the precise molecular mechanism of
emetine action remains unknown.
Viruses are well known to exploit several cellular factors to effectively transcribe and
translate their genome(Kumar et al., 2020). Like several other viruses, coronaviruses
also synthesizetheir protein in cap-dependent manner wherein eIF4E plays a critical
role in the initiation of translation(Nakagawa et al., 2016). Since emetine was found to
decrease synthesis of viral proteins, we hypothesize ifinhibitory effect of emetine is
mediated via disrupting viral mRNA and eIF4E interaction. As in the case of other
coronaviruses (Nakagawa et al., 2016), inhibiting the cellular eIF4E activityresulted in
decreasedSARS-CoV-2 replication which suggested the virus supportive role of
eIF4E.Further, in a CHIP assay, we demonstrated that emetine inhibitsinteraction of the
viral RNA with cap-binding protein eIF4E(Fig. 6b andFig. 8). eIF4E activation is
commonly mediated via RTK/ERK/MNK1/eIF4Esignalling axis(Kumar et al.,
2018).Blocking these upstream eIF4E kinases resulted in reduced SARS-CoV-2

replication which suggested that ERK/MNK1/eIF4E signalling is prerequisite for SARSCoV-2 replication(Fig. 8). Nevertheless previous studies suggest that coronaviruses
induces eIF4E activation which plays a virus supportive role in coronavirus (including
SARS-CoV-2)life cycle (Cencic et al., 2011; Gordon et al., 2020; Mizutani et al., 2004;
Müller et al., 2018).
Since virus replication requires the presence of the viral structural and nonstructuralproteins, their (viral polymerase), their restricted availability (in the presence of
emetine) couldeventually block viral genome replicationwhich we have observed in our
study in the form of reduced levels of viral RNA and mRNA. Alternatively, emetine may
directly inhibit certain viral polymerases (Aguiar et al., 2007; Chaves Valadao et al.,
2015). However, in a cell free virion polymerase assay, we could not observe any direct
effect of emetine on the function of viral polymerase (data not shown) which suggests
that the major mechanism of action of emetine is mediated via targeting the cellular
factor(s), one (eIF4E) which is described in this study. Like eIF4E, emetine may also
target other host-dependency factors. Additional studies that involve
transcriptome/proteome/phospho-proteome/lipidome analysis in emetine-treated anduntreated cells are required to precisely elucidate the molecular mechanism of the
action of emetine.
The high selective index of emetine suggests its potential as anti-SARS-CoV-2
agent. However, since emetine also targets cellular factors, in vivo cytotoxicity may be a
potential difficulty of its use. For the treatment of amebiasis, emetine is given at 1 mg/kg
body weight daily for up to 10 days without any side effects (Mastrangelo et al., 1973).

As an anti-cancer agent (clinical trials), emetine was shown to be well tolerated when
delivered intravenously at 1.5 mg/kg doses twice a week (Panettiere and Coltman,
1971). In a mouse CMV (MCMV) model, emetine inhibited virus replication at an oral
dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight(Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016)which is somewhat in the
similar range required to protect chicken embryos against virulent IBVchallenge in this
study (considering an embryo weight of 20 gram and an EC50 of 2.3 ng/egg). Although
the route of administration and potential cumulative cytotoxicity needs to be determined
in the case of COVID-19, the doses required for virus inhibition are substantially lower
than the traditional emetine doses used to treat amebiasis and other ailments.
Considering these facts in view, it is apparent that emetine has the potential to treat
COVID-19.
In vitro antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and its ability to protect chicken
embryos against virulent IBV suggests that emetine could be repurposed to treat
COVID-19. In addition, we provide a novel mechanistic insight into the antiviral activity
of emetine. Emetine targets SARS-CoV-2 protein synthesis which is mediated by
inhibiting the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA with the cellular cap-binding protein
eIF4E.
