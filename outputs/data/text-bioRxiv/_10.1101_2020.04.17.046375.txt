Abstract:
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has brought about an
unprecedented crisis, taking a heavy toll on human health, lives as well as the global
economy. There are no SARS-CoV-2-specific treatments or vaccines available due to
the novelty of this virus. Hence, rapid development of effective vaccines against
SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. Here we developed a pilot-scale production of a
purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc), which induced
SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats and non-human primates.
These antibodies potently neutralized 10 representative SARS-CoV-2 strains,
indicative of a possible broader neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 strains
circulating worldwide. Immunization with two different doses (3μg or 6 μg per dose)
provided partial or complete protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge,
respectively, without any antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Systematic
evaluation of PiCoVacc via monitoring clinical signs, hematological and biochemical
index, and histophathological analysis in macaques suggests that it is safe. These data
support the rapid clinical development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for humans.

One Sentence Summary: A purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine
candidate (PiCoVacc) confers complete protection in non-human primates against
SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide by eliciting potent humoral responses
devoid of immunopathology

Main Text: The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of coronavirus
disease in 2019 (COVID-19) to be a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. It is reported that
~80% of COVID-19 patients have mild-to-moderate symptoms, while ~20% develop
serious manifestations such as severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS), sepsis and even death (1). The number of COVID-19 cases has increased at
a staggering rate globally. As of 10 April, the total confirmed cases have reached
1,623, 173 and the death toll has risen to 97,236. Severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic, belongs
to the genus Betacoronavirus (β-CoV) of the family Coronavirdae (2). SARS-CoV-2
along with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the
Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), constitute
the three most life-threatening species among all human coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2
harbors a linear single-stranded positive sense RNA genome, encoding 4 structural
proteins [spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N)] of which S is
a major protective antigen that elicits highly potent neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), 16
non-structural proteins (nsp1-nsp16) and several accessory proteins (3). No specific
antiviral drugs or vaccines against the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 are currently
available. Therefore, urgency in the development of vaccines is of vital importance to
curb the pandemic and prevent new viral outbreaks.

Multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccine types, such as DNA-, RNA-based formulations,
recombinant-subunits containing viral epitopes, adenovirus-based vectors and purified
inactivated virus are under development (4-6). Purified inactivated viruses have been
traditionally used for vaccine development and such vaccines have been found to be
safe and effective for the prevention of diseases caused by viruses like influenza virus
and poliovirus (7, 8). To develop preclinical in vitro neutralization and challenge
models for a candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we isolated SARS-CoV-2 strains from
the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples of 11 hospitalized patients
(including 5 ICU patients), among which 4 are from China, 4 from Italy, 1 from

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.046375; this version posted April 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

Switzerland, 1 from UK and 1 from Spain (table. S1). These patients were infected
with SARS-CoV-2 during the most recent outbreak. The 11 samples contained
SARS-CoV-2 strains are widely scattered on the phylogenic tree constructed from all
available sequences, representing, to some extent, the circulating populations (Fig. 1A
and fig. S1). We chose strain CN2 for purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine
development (PiCoVacc) and other 10 strains (termed as CN1, CN3-CN5 and
OS1-OS6) as preclinical challenge strains. A number of strains amongst these,
including CN1 and OS1, which are closely related to 2019-nCoV-BetaCoV
/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 and EPI_ISL_412973, respectively, have been reported to cause
severe clinical symptoms, including respiratory failure, requiring mechanical
ventilation (9, 10).

To obtain a viral stock adapted for efficient growth in Vero cells for PiCoVacc
production, the CN3 strain was firstly plaque purified and passaged once in Vero cells
to generate the P1 stock. After this another four passages were performed to generate
the P2-P5 stocks. Growth kinetics analysis of the P5 stock in Vero cells showed that
this stock replicated efficiently and reached a peak titer of 6-7 log10 TCID50/ml by 3 or
4 days post infection (dpi) at multiplicities of infection (MOI) of 0.0001-0.01 at
temperatures between 33°C-37°C (fig. 1B). To evaluate the genetic stability of
PiCoVacc, 5 more passages were performed to obtain the P10 stock, whole genome of
which, together with those of the P1, P3 and P5 stocks were sequenced. Compared to
P1, only two amino acid substitutions, Ala → Asp at E residue 32 (E-A32D) and Thr
→ Ile at nsp10 residue 49 (nsp10-T32I), occurred in P5 and P10 stocks (table. S2),
suggesting that PiCoVacc CN2 strain possesses excellent genetic stability without any
S mutations that might potentially alter the NAb epitopes. To produce pilot scale
PiCoVacc for animal studies, the virus was propagated in a 50-liter culture of Vero
cells using cell factory and inactivated by using β-propiolactone (Fig. 1C). The virus
was purified using depth filtration and two optimized steps of chromatography,
yielding a highly pure preparation of PiCoVacc (Fig. 1D). Additionally, cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis showed intact oval-shaped particles with diameters of

90-150 nm, which are embellished with crown-like spikes, representing a prefusion
state of the virus (Fig. 1E).

To assess the immunogenicity of PiCoVacc, groups of BALB/c mice (n=10) were
injected at day 0 and day 7 with various doses of PiCoVacc mixed with alum adjuvant
(0, 1.5 or 3 or 6 μg per dose, 0 μg in physiological saline as the sham group). No
inflammation or other adverse effects were observed. Spike-, receptor binding domain
(RBD)-, and N-specific antibody responses were evaluated by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) at weeks 1-6 after initial immunization (fig. S2).
SARS-CoV-2 S- and RBD-specific immunoglobulin G (Ig G) developed quickly in
the serum of vaccinated mice and peaked at the titer of 819,200 (>200 μg/ml) and
409,600 (>100 μg/ml), respectively, at week 6 (Fig. 2A). RBD-specific Ig G accounts
for half of the S induced antibody responses, suggesting RBD is the dominant
immunogen, which closely matches the serological profile of the blood of recovered
COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2A and 2B) (11). Surprisingly, the amount of N-specific Ig
G induced is ~30-fold lower than the antibodies targeting S or RBD in immunized
mice. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that the N-specific Ig G is largely
abundant in the serum of COVID-19 patients and serves as one of the clinical
diagnostic markers (11). It’s worthy to note that PiCoVacc could elicit much higher
S-specific antibody titers than those of the serum from the recovered COVID-19
patients. This observation coupled with the fact that the antibodies targeting N of
SARS-CoV-2 do not provide protective immunity against the infection (12), suggest
that PiCoVacc is capable of eliciting more effective antibody responses (Fig. 2A and
2B). Next, we measured SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies over a period
of time using microneutralization assays (MN50). Similar to S-specific Ig G responses,
the neutralizing antibody titer against the CN1 strain emerged at week 1 (12 for high
dose immunization), surged after the week 2 booster and reached up to around 1,500
for low and medium doses and 3,000 for high dose at week 7, respectively (Fig. 2A).
In contrast, the sham group did not develop detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody
responses (Fig. 2A and 2B). In addition, immunogenic evaluations of PiCoVacc in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.046375; this version posted April 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

Wistar rats with the same immunization strategy yielded similar results - the
maximum neutralizing titers reached 2,048-4,096 at week 7 (Fig. 2C). To investigate
the spectrum of neutralizing activities elicited by PiCoVacc, we conducted
neutralization assays against the other 9 isolated SARS-CoV-2 strains using mouse
and rat serums collected 3 weeks post vaccination. Neutralizing titers against these
strains demonstrate that PiCoVacc is capable of eliciting antibodies that possibly
exhibit potent neutralization activities against SARS-Cov-2 strains circulating
worldwide (Fig. 2D and 2E).

We next evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of PiCoVacc in rhesus
macaques (Macaca mulatta), a non-human primate species that shows a
COVID-19-like disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection (13). Macaques were
immunized three times via the intramuscular route with medium (3 μg per dose) or
high doses (6 μg per dose) of PiCoVacc at day 0, 7 and 14 (n=4). S-specific IgG and
NAb were induced at week 2 and rose to ~12,800 and ~50, respectively at week 3
(before virus challenge) in both vaccinated groups, whose titers are similar to those of
serum from the recovered COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3A and 3B). Unexpectedly, NAb
titer (61) in medium dose immunized group was ~20% more than that observed (50)
in high dose vaccinated group at week 3, possibly due to individual differences in the
ability of one animal in medium dose group in eliciting ~10-fold higher titer when
compared to the other 3 (Fig. 3B). Excluding this exception, NAb titer in medium
dose group would drop down to 34, ~40% lower than that in high dose group.
Subsequently, we conducted a challenge study by a direct inoculation of 106 TCID50
of SARS-CoV-2 CN1 into the animal lung through intratracheal route at day 22 (one
day after the third immunization) in vaccinated and control macaques to verify the
protective efficacy. Expectedly, all control (sham and placebo) macaques showed
excessive copies (104-106/ml) of viral genomic RNA in pharynx, crissum and lung by
day 3-7 post-inoculation (dpi) and severe interstitial pneumonia (Fig. 3C-3F). By
contrast, all vaccinated macaques were largely protected against SARS-CoV-2
infection with very small histopathological changes in lung, which probably were

caused by a direct inoculation of 106 TCID50 of virus into the lung through
intratracheal route, that needed longer time (more than one week) to recover
completely (Fig. 3F). Viral loads decreased significantly in all vaccinated macaques,
but increased slightly in control animals from day 3-7 after infection (Fig. 3C-3E). All
four macaques that received the high dose, had no detectable viral loads in pharynx,
crissum and lung at day 7 after infection. In medium dose immunized group, we
indeed partially detected the viral blip from pharyngeal (3/4), anal (2/4) and
pulmonary (1/4) specimens at day 7 after infection, whilst viral loads presented a ~95%
reduction when compared to the sham groups (Fig. 3C-3E). Interestingly, NAb titer in
vaccinated groups decreased by ~30% by 3 days post infection to neutralize viruses,
then rapidly increased from day 5-7 after infection to maintain its potent
neutralization efficacy. In comparison with high dose vaccination group (titer of
~145), higher NAb titers observed in medium dose vaccinated group at day 7 after
infection (~400 for 4 macaques; ~300 for 3 macaques, if the one outlier is discarded)
might have resulted from relatively low level of viral replication, suggesting a
requirement of longer time for complete viral clearance. No antibody-dependent
enhancement of infection (ADE) was observed for any vaccinated macaques despite
the observation that relatively low NAb titer existed within the medium dose group
before infection, offering partial protection.

Previous experiences with the development of SARS and MERS vaccine candidates
had raised concerns about pulmonary immunopathology, either directly caused by a
type 2 helper T-cell (Th2) response or as a result of ADE (4, 14, 15). Although T-cell
responses elicited by many vaccines have been demonstrated to be crucial for acute
viral clearance, protection from subsequent coronavirus infections is largely mediated
by humoral immunity (16, 17). The “cytokine storm” induced by excessive T-cell
responses have been actually shown to accentuate the pathogenesis of COVID19 (18,
19). Therefore, T-cell responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have to be well
controlled in order to avoid immunopathology. In context with this, we systematically
evaluated safety of PiCoVacc in macaques by recording a number of clinical

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.046375; this version posted April 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

observations and biological indices. Two groups of macaques (n=10) were immunized
by intramuscular injection with low (1.5 μg) or high doses (6 μg) and another two
groups of macaques (n=10) were immunized with adjuvant (sham) and physiological
saline (placebo) for three times at day 0, 7 and 14. Neither fever nor weight loss was
observed in any macaque after the immunization of PiCoVacc, and the appetite and
mental state of all animals remained normal (Fig. S3). Hematological and biochemical
analysis, including biochemical blood test, lymphocyte subset percent (CD3+, CD4+
and CD8+) and key cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6) showed no
notable changes in vaccinated groups when compared to the sham and placebo groups
(Fig. 4A-4B and fig. S4-S5). In addition, histopathological evaluations of various
organs, including lung, heart, spleen, liver, kidney and brain, from the 4 groups at day
29 demonstrated that PiCoVacc did not cause any notable pathology in macaques (Fig.
4C and fig. S6).

The serious pandemic of the current COVID19 and the precipitously increasing
numbers of death worldwide necessitate the urgent development of a SARS-CoV-2
vaccine, requiring a new pandemic paradigm. The safety and efficacy are essential for
vaccine development at both stages of preclinical studies and clinical trials. Although
it’s still too early to define the best animal model for studying SARS-CoV-2 infections,
rhesus macaques that mimic COVID-19-like symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection
appear quite promising animal models for studying the disease. We provide extensive
evidences for the safety of PiCoVacc in macaques; neither infection enhancement nor
immunopathological exacerbation was observed in our studies. Our data also
demonstrate a complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge with a 6μg per
dose of PiCoVacc in macaques. Collectively these results suggest a path forward for
clinical development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for use in humans. Phases I, II and III
clinical trials with PiCoVacc, as well as other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, are
expected to begin later this year.

Materials and Methods
Facility and ethics statements
All experiments with live SARS-CoV-2 viruses were performed in the enhanced
biosafety level 3 (P3+) facilities in the Institute of Laboratory Animal Science,
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) approved by the National Health
Commission of the People’s Republic of China. All experiments with mice, rats and
macaques were carried out in accordance with the Regulations in the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Ministry of Science and Technology of
the People’s Republic of China.
Virus titration
SARS-CoV-2 virus titer was determined by microdose cytopathogenic efficiency
(CPE) assay. Serial 10-fold dilutions of virus contained samples were mixed with
1-2 × 104 Vero cells, and then plated in 96-well culture plate. After 3-7 days culture
in a 5% CO2 incubator at 36.5°C, cells were checked under a microscope for the
presence of CPE. Virus titer was calculated by the method of Karber (20).
Vaccine candidate preparation
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, isolated from a COVID-19 infected patient, was
provided by Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Viruses were cultured in large-scale Vero cells factories, and inactivated with

β-propiolactone for 24 hours, followed by purification with Ion-exchange
Chromatography (IEC) and Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) method. The
purified viruses were mixed with Al(OH)3 adjuvant and served as SARS-CoV-2
vaccine candidate.
RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from organs as described previously (13) with the RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen) and the PrimerScript RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa). The forward and
reverse primers targeting against the envelope (E) gene of SARS-CoV-2 used for
RT-PCR

were

5 ′-

TCGTTTCGGAAGAGACAGGT-3′

and

5 ′-

GCGCAGTAAGGATGGCTAGT-3′ , respectively. RT-PCR was performed at the
reaction conditions of 50°C for 30 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 min, 94°C
for 15 s, and 60°C for 45 s.

Vaccine immunogenicity analysis
Balb/c mice, wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups and immunized
intraperitoneally and intramuscularly with the trial vaccine at three doses (1.5 μg, 3 μg,
6 μg/dose)，respectively. All grouped animals were immunized for two times (at day 0
and 7). The control group was injected with physiological saline. Animals were bled
from the tail veins, followed by antibody neutralizing assay to analyze vaccines
immunogenicity.
Neutralizing assay
Serum samples collected from immunized animals were inactivated at 56°C for 0.5h
and serially diluted with cell culture medium in two-fold steps. The diluted serums
were mixed with a virus suspension of 100 TCID50 in 96-well plates at a ratio of 1:1,
followed by 2 hours incubation at 36.5°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. 1-2 × 104 Vero cells
were then added to the serum-virus mixture, and the plates were incubated for 5 days at
36.5°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cytopathic effect (CPE) of each well was recorded
under microscopes, and the neutralizing titer was calculated by the dilution number of
50% protective condition.
Enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA)
SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer of serum samples collected from immunized animals was
determined by indirect ELISA assay. 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 0.1 μg
of purified S protein, M protein, N protein individually at 2-8°C overnight, and blocked
with 2% BSA for 1h at room temperature. Diluted sera (1:100) were applied to each
well for 2h at 37°C, followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse antibodies conjugated
with HRP for 1h at 37°C after 3 times PBS wash. The plate was developed using TMB,
following 2M H2SO4 addition to stop the reaction, and read at 450/630nm by ELISA
plate reader for final data.
Vaccine safety evaluation
SARS-CoV-2 trial vaccine’s safety was evaluated in macaques. Four groups monkeys
(5 female and 5 male monkeys/group) were immunized with high dose (6μg /dose), low
dose (1.5μg /dose) vaccine, Al(OH)3 adjuvant and physiological saline individually for
three times at days 0, 7 and 14. Datasets of many safety related parameters were
collected during and after immunization, including clinical observation, body weight,

body temperature. Analysis of lymphocyte subset percent (CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+),
key cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-2、IL-4、IL-5、IL-6) and biochemical blood test
are also performed in collected blood samples. 60% of monkeys were euthanized at day
18 post immunization, and the left 40% were euthanized at day 29. Organs of lung,
heart, spleen, liver, kidney and brain were collected for pathologic analysis.
Challenge assay of rhesus macaques
Rhesus macaques (3-4 years old) were divided into four groups and injected
intramuscularly with high dose (6 μg/dose), medium dose (3 μg/dose) vaccine,
Al(OH)3 adjuvant and physiological saline respectively. All grouped animals were
immunized at three times (days 0, 7 and 14) before challenged with 106 TCID50/ml
SARS-CoV-2 virus by intratracheal routes. Macaques were euthanized and lung tissues
were collected at 7 days post inoculation (dpi). At day 3, 5, 7 dpi, the throat, and anal
swabs were collected. Blood samples were collected on 0, 7, 14, and 21 days post
immunization, and 3, 5, 7 dpi for hematological analysis and neutralizing antibody test
of SARS-CoV-2. Lung tissues were collected at 7 dpi, and used for RT-PCR assay and
histopathological assay.
Protein expression and purification
To express the prefusion S ectodomain, a gene encoding residues 1−1208 of
COVID-19 S (GenBank: MN908947) with proline substitutions at residues 986 and
987, a “GSAS” substitution at the furin cleavage site (residues 682–685) and a
2×StrepTag was synthesized and cloned into the mammalian expression vector
pCAGGS. To express the COVID-19 RBD, residues 319−591 of COVID-19 S were
cloned upstream of a 2×StrepTag into the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS. To
express the N protein, residues 1-419 (GenBank: QHW06046.1) was cloned into
vector pET-28a containing a C-terminal 6×His. S ectodomain and RBD were used to
transiently transfect HEK Expi 293F cells (Thermo Fisher) using polyethylenimine.
Protein was purified from filtered cell supernatants using StrepTactin resin (IBA)
before being subjected to additional purification by size-exclusion chromatography
using either a Superose 6 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) or a Superdex 200 10/300
Increase column (GE Healthcare) in 20mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl. The N protein
was produced in BL21(DE3) upon the introduction of IPTG. After ultrasonication, the

(https://www.gisaid.org/), NCBI and BIGD (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov) database.
After quality control (removing sequences with low quality or short sequence length),
455 sequences were retained for the phylogenetic analysis. By combining 9 target
sequences with the sequences from the public databases, we conducted sequence
alignment using MAFFT and performed phylogenic reconstruction using IQtree (21)
with default parameters. The inferred maximum likelihood tree is plotted using ggtree
(22).
Cryo-EM sample preparation
For cryo-EM sample preparation, a 3 μL aliquot of purified viral particles was applied
to a glow-discharged C-flat R2/1 Cu grid. Grids were manually blotted for 3 s in 100%
relative humidity for plunge-freezing (Vitrobot; FEI) in liquid ethane, as descripted
previously (23). All samples were examined on a Titan Krios microscope (FEI).
