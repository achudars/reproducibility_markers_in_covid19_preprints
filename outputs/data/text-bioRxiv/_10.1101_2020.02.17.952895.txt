Abstract
The spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a global emergency, that
demands urgent solutions for detection and therapy to prevent escalating health, social and
economic impacts. The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor
ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells1.
The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar2, but structural differences in
the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1–specific neutralizing
antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-23. Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all
sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these
viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two
completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif
(PBM). These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to
increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)4-6, the
leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection7,8. However, three drugs
approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting
upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride9,10) or the PBM
(SB2035805), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated
for SARS-CoV-1in animal models. Hence, blocking the SARS protein E inhibits development
of ARDS in vivo. Given that our results demonstrate that the protein E subcluster for the SARS
clade is quasi-identical for the key functional regions of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we
conclude that use of approved drugs shown to act as SARS E protein inhibitors can help prevent
further casualties from COVID-2019 while vaccines and other preventive measures are being
developed.

Introduction
The current epidemic of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a rising global
health emergency (WHO https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019)
with disruptive health, social and economic repercussions. Three major actions, confinement,
detection and therapy are required to contain this pandemic. Detection and therapy can be
guided by virus sequence data, which was first made available in 17 December, 2019 at
gsaid.org, soon after detection of the first cases. The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data are
a pivotal resource on its own, but can gain greater value when embedded within those of other
Betacoronavirus, allowing a comparative pangenomic analysis. This approach can help
identify the core genome of Betacoronaviruses and extract accessory genomic features shared
by a subset of these viruses or unique to SARS-CoV-2. Whereas core genomic features are
required for the virus to be functional, accessory features are candidates to provide insights
into the drivers of the unique capacities of SARS-CoV-2 explaining its spread and virulence.
Genome annotation and structural modelling can then be used to assess the possible functions
of these accessory features and guide approaches to detection and treatment.
Here we apply a comparative pangenomic approach of all Betacoronavirus genomes sequenced
thus far (Table 1), to detect the core and accessory gene cluster of this genus, and then annotate
the functions, further assessed through structural analysis. Furthermore, we provide insights
into importance, key features and differences in the Envelope protein, E, conserved separately
in SARS, MERS and coronaviruses from other animals.
Results and Discussion
We used a pangenome approach to explore the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (MN985325 and
related isolates) in comparison to other Betacornaviruses, including SARS and MERS.
Previous approaches11 proceeded by extracting individual genes, aligning them, and then
establishing a phylogeny. Our approach differs in that we first cluster all sequences to then
calculate the alignment. This approach, based on using panX12, allows us to achieve a higher
sensibility in the detection of gene clusters. The resulting pangenome including all core and
accessory gene clusters, interactive trees and alignments from 24 Betacoronavirus genomes,
including 4 isolates from SARS-CoV-2, is available at https://pangenomedb.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/.
There are five essential genes in coronaviruses, the Spike protein (S), Membrane glycoprotein
(M), Nucleocapsid (N), envelope protein (E) and the Orf1ab (a large polyprotein known as
replicase/protease), all required to produce a structurally complete viral particle13. These five
genes define the core pan-genome. However, panX12 only retrieved four of these (S, M, N and
the ORF1ab) as components of the core pan-genome (Figure 1). However, the fifth gene in the
Betacoronavirus core genome, the envelope protein (E), varied among genomes, defining three
distinct subclusters within the envelope protein E of Betacoronaviruses (Figure 2). One of these
E clusters comprises only SARS-CoV-1 (AY274119), SARS-CoV-2 and two Bat
Coronaviruses (MG772933 and KF63652). Among the other two protein E gene clusters, one
includes MERS (JX869059 and KC164505) and several coronaviruses from different animals,
while the third cluster includes coronaviruses from two Rousettus bats. To validate the
conservation and specificity of the SARS E cluster, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 E sequence
with all known sequences in NCBI’s non redundant (NR) protein database. This comparison
showed, consistent with our pan-genome analysis, that the subcluster of the protein E gene
appearing in SARS-CoV-2, SARS and two bat coronaviruses, is defined by the same essential
functional features, which are exactly conserved (100% similarity) between bats and SARSCoV-2, but differ slightly (95% similarity with one deletion and three substitutions) from

SARS (Figure 2B and supplementary figure 7). A recent study compared genomes and gene
families of all alpha, beta, delta and gamma coronaviruses, but did not explore the variability
present within the protein E gene sequences, which we did through the clustering approach
reported above.
We found five accessory gene clusters (15% of the accessory genome of genus
Betacoronavirus) common to SARS-like coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, out of 33
total accessory gene clusters. Four of these gene clusters (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF8,
Fig. 1A), appear only in SARS-CoV-2, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and the SARS virus. A gene cluster
annotated as ORF10 appeared to be unique to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1). However, a blast-based
search against the DNA of all sequences in NCBI’s NT database showed that the ORF10
sequence matches with 100% coverage in DNA of other SARS-like genomes, but there is no
open-reading frame predicted for those genomes in the matching region (Fig 1A). Hence, the
apparent uniqueness of ORF10 might simply be an artifact of the GeneBank annotation
pipeline that did not predict an ORF for this gene in other matching genomes. However, for
completeness, we report a functional analysis of ORF10 as Supplementary material
(Supplementary material 1) since at present there is no experimental evidence available against
or in favor of this being a real gene.
Compared to the essential genes S, M, N, E and ORF1ab, other genes such as ORF3a and
ORF7a
are
poorly
characterized,
according
to
GenBank
annotations
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/proteins/86693?genome_assembly_id=760344). Our
bioinformatic protein structural analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a (cluster 12), also
known as viroporin, and ORF7a (cluster 17), that is same as ORF8a14 in SARS, retain the
structural features observed in other SARS viruses, namely a multi-pass transmembrane
domain and a cytoplasmic b-barrel or b-sandwich fold (ORF3a) and an N-terminal secpathway signal peptide, cleaved after residue 15, an immunoglobulin-like b-sandwich fold
stabilized by two cysteine di-sulfide bonds, and a C-terminal single-pass transmembrane helix
(ORF7a; Supplementary Figures 5,6). Hence these SARS-CoV-2 proteins are expected to act
in the same way as they do in other SARS, namely as accessory proteins mostly localized in
the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment, but also occurring on the cell
membrane where they enhance viral pathogenicity and mortality through protein-protein
interactions15-17.
The remaining two accessory gene clusters, ORF6, ORF8, present in SARS-CoV-2, SARS and
bat-SL-CoVZC45 are functionally uncharacterized. All are very short polypeptides (61, 121
and 38 residues for ORF6 and 8, respectively) with a large percentage of hydrophobic residues
(62%, 56%, respectively). None of the proteins have trans-membrane regions, but ORF8 has
an N-terminal sec-pathway signal peptide with a cleavage site after residues 15, suggesting that
it is secreted into the extracellular space (Supplementary Figures 5,6). Following signal peptide
cleavage, the ORF8 protein core is predicted to consist largely of b-strands and features 7
cysteines. We predict that this protein adopts a cysteine disulfide-bond stabilized b-sandwich
structure similar to the soluble domain of ORF7a (Supplementary Figures 5,6), inferring that
ORF8 also functions as ligand binding module. ORF6 consists of a long amphipathic helical
region, followed by an acidic tail. Our deep-learning-based annotation (DeepGOPlus18)
suggested that ORFs 6, 7, 8 are involved in the regulation of molecular functions, either in
response to stimuli (ORFs 8), or in cellular component biogenesis and organization (ORF6)
(Suppl. Figure 2-4). Collectively, our analysis suggested no major function or gene cluster to
be unique to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our analysis is in agreement with ORFs 3a, 6, 7a, 8 and

being accessory non-essential proteins, that would be inefficient targets for COVID-2019
therapy.
The S protein binds to the host receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for preventing
viral entry into host cells1. The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar2,
but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARSCoV-1–specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-23. We therefore focused our
attention on the protein E, which is highly similar in SARS-CoV. The E protein, also a
viroporin19, was previously confirmed as a determinant of pathogenicity4,5 in SARS-CoV-1.
Protein E was used as target for SARS antivirals6, and studies using SARS-CoV with lacking
or mutated protein E as vaccine candidates showed promising results20-23. Furthermore, the E
gene is one of the key genes used in identification of SARS-CoV-2 through RT-PCR7,24.
The SARS-Cov-1 protein E has ion channel (IC) activity and features a postsynaptic density95/discs large/zona occludens-1 (PDZ)-binding motif (PBM). Both IC and PBM were required
for SARS-CoV to induce virulence in mice14. The protein E from SARS-CoV-2 differs from
that of SARS-CoV-1 only by three substitutions and one deletion (Figure 2A-B). The PBM
and IC are identical in all SARS E proteins in cluster 1, but distinct in orthologues from the
other two clusters (Figure 2B-D). The substitutions and insertions are positioned in flexible
cytoplasmic regions, where they are not expected to affect the protein structure, IC or function
of the PBM (Figure 2E).
Studies on SARS-CoV-1 demonstrated that the E protein uses the IC and PBM to trigger a
cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs.
Ultimately these events result in ARDS4-6, a leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARSCoV-2 infection7,8. However, the drugs Amantadine, Hexamethylene amiloride and also
BIT225 (BIT225 is in clinical trials) completely block the IC activity of SARS-CoV-19,10 and
restrict its reproduction, leading to better survival of the animal host. The PBM enables the E
protein to interact with the cellular PDZ domains. Its association with the tandem PDZ domains
of syntenin activates the MAP kinase p38, triggering the overexpression of inflammatory
cytokines. Consequently, inhibition of p38 by SB203580 increases the survival of the host5.
The high level of conservation of the IC and PBM within clade 2, including SARS-CoV-1 and
SARS-CoV-2, strongly suggests that the available inhibitors for the E protein of SARS-CoV1 should also be active on SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusion
Therapies to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the lethality caused by the resulting
COVID-2019 are currently focusing primarily on S, the viral spike protein3,25,26. However,
despite high similarities between proteins S between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses,
existing neutralizing antibodies are ineffective against SARS-CoV-23. Hence, new antibodies
that bind specifically to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein need to be developed, tested and
approved for human use, which would be a time-consuming process.
Our pangenomic analysis suggests that the protein E of all SARS viruses preserves its critical
motifs used for pathogenesis. Hence, we predict that the readily available and approved
inhibitors (Amantadine, Hexamethylene amiloride and SB203580), that proved efficient for
alleviating ARDS in SARS-CoV-1-infected animal models should also be effective against

SARS-CoV-2. While not preventing future spreading of the virus, these inhibitors might reduce
the mortality rate while effective vaccines are being developed.
Methods
Collection of Betacoronavirus strains.
The NCBI genome assemblies page was searched, on January 26, for taxonid of genus
Betacoronavirus, resulting in a list of 22 genomes, including four isolates of SARS-CoV-2.
We downloaded in addition to this initial list two more assemblies one for a bat coronavirus
(MG772933) and another for MERS (KF600630), see Table 1. For easy identification of genes
and annotations from GenBank, we included unique locus_tag identifiers containing locus id
and an index number. Metadata was collected to define user friendly strain names and to
understand phylogenetic trees in the context of virus host, country, taxon id and data release
date.
Creating a pangenome for Betacoronavirus
GenBank annotation and sequences were used as a starting point for this pangenomic analysis
study. These GenBank annotations contain heterogeneous identifiers for genes so we included
unique locus tags containing the strain accession number and gene index number for
computational processing. In addition, we collected metadata for these coronaviruses for
displaying on the interactive phylogenetic trees for analysis later on. Gene sequences were
compared to each other for sequence similarity, followed by gene clustering. Phylogenetic
analysis was carried out on the core gene clusters to produce a species tree and similarly for
each gene cluster to produce gene trees. For this pangenome analysis we used panX12 (Ding et
al., 2018) that takes GenBank files as input and extracts gene coordinates, annotations from
GenBank and sequences from these genomes on both nucleotide and protein levels. For
interactive visualization of pangenome clusters, alignments and phylogenetic trees we used
panX visualization module obtain from github, https://github.com/neherlab/pan-genomevisualization/. Other databases showing greater detail about many viruses, such as Virus
Pathogen Resource (VIPR, https://www.viprbrc.org) and GSAID (https://www.gisaid.org) are
very useful but these resources do not provide gene clustering or pan-genome analysis.
Re-annotation of proteins from Betacoronavirus genomes using KAUST Metagenomic
Analysis Platform (KMAP) annotation pipeline.
To annotate uncharacterized genes in Betacoronavirus, we utilized all available protein
sequences available from the clustering analysis as an input to our Automatic Annotation of
Microbial Genomes (AAMG) pipeline27, available via KAUST Metagenomic Analysis
Platform (http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/kmap). AAMG uses sequence-based BLAST to
UniProtKB (www.uniprot.org), KEGG (www.kegg.jp) and also Protein Family (PFam)
domain detection using InterPro (www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro).
Prediction of function using DeepGOPlus.
We used all genes from Betacoronavirus dataset in order to explore Gene Ontology predictions
through our in-house DeepGOPlus 18 tool that combines deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) model with sequence similarity-based predictions to derive relevant functional classes
from Gene Ontology alongside a confidence score. Results were included with a score 0.1 and
filtered for class specificity. Predicted Gene Ontology (GO) terms with a confidence score from
DeepGOPlus were visualized using QuickGO (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/) for SARS-

Structure based prediction of function
ProtParam (https://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/protparam/protparam) was used for calculating
protein features. Phobius (http://phobius.sbc.su.se/) and SignalP-5.0 were used for prediction
of transmembrane regions and signal peptides 28. Jpred4 was used to calculate secondary
structure features (http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred4/). 3D modelling was carried out
using SwissModel (homology modelling)29 or QUARK (ab initio structure predictions)30.

Supplementary Information 1, ORF10 gene in SARS-CoV-2:
A short gene predicted in in SARS-CoV-2, known as ORF10, appears unique only to SARSCoV-2. A sequence comparison of this gene to DNA of all Betacoronavirus genomes in NCBI
shows matches in SARS and SARS-like genomes with 100% coverage, although no gene has
been predicted in matching location of ORF10 in SARS or SARS-like genomes. This raises a
question whether ORF10 is an artifact of annotation in SARS-CoV-2 where it has been
predicted or an artifact in SARS and SARS-like genomes where it has not been predicted.
There is no experimental data available to approve or disprove the reality of this gene. For
completeness purposes we included ORF10 in our functional and structural analysis of SARSCoV-2 but not included in the main text.
Supplementary Figure 4-6 shows predicted Gene Ontology and structural information about
ORF10 using deep learning Gene Ontology Prediction tool (DeepGOplus). It shows that,
similar to ORF8, this gene regulates molecular functions and contributes to response to
stimulus. It is predicted to be localized only in the extracellular region of the host cells. OF10
is predicted to harbor a long helix followed by a b-strand and appears to be localized only in
the extracellular region of the host cells. It has been concluded that SARS-CoV-2 accessory
genes, including ORF10, carry a helper function and do not serve as a major target for detection
or therapy of COVID-2019.

Supplementary Figure 1.
DeepGOPlus predicted Gene Ontology Graph for SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein, E.
According to predictions, the protein can be localized in the host cell Golgi apparatus, vacuoles,
endoplasmic reticulum, and membrane cell periphery of the host cell. It contributes to the
process of disruption of the host cell and viral budding from Golgi membrane.

DeepGOPlus predicted Gene Ontology Graph for SARS-CoV-2 ORF6. Predictions generally
describe this protein to be localized in a membrane protein complex. It negatively regulates
biological processes and contributes to cellular localization and biogenesis.

Supplementary Figure 3.
DeepGOPlus predicted Gene Ontology Graph for SARS-CoV-2 ORF8. This protein
contributes to processes as response to stimulus along with biological regulation and potentially
localized in vacuoles, cell periphery and extracellular regions.

Supplementary Figure 4.
DeepGOPlus Gene Ontology Graph for SARS-CoV-2 gene, ORF10. Similar to ORF8, this
protein (if this predicted ORF is not an annotation artifact, see Figure 1) regulates molecular
functions and contributes to response to stimulus. It is predicted to be localized only in the
extracellular region of the host cells.

Supplementary Figure 6
Prediction of secondary structure characteristics and tertiary architecture (colour-ramped
from N- (blue) to C-terminus (red)). E: homology model based on the pentameric SARS CoV
E protein (PDB Id 5x29, 26% sequence identity). Only one chain is colour-ramped. The
membrane (pale pink) is indicated with cytoplasmic and luminal sides labelled. Note that the
N-terminal 7 and C-terminal 15 residues are not included in the model. ORF3a and ORF7a:
structural models for the soluble domains. The two di-sulphide bridges conserved in SARS
ORF3a are shown in magenta (template: 1xak). 90˚ views of ab initio models are shown for
ORF6 and ORF10. Hydrophobic and charged side chains are highlighted in ORF6, and
hydrophobic side chains are highlighted in ORF10.

Supplementary Figure 7. Alignment of SARS-CoV-2 E protein comparison to hits available
in NCBI’s NR database. The first two appear from SARS-CoV-2 and rest of the hits appear
from SARS and SARS-like Betacoronaviruses. This result shows SARS-CoV-2 E protein is
conserved only in SARS clade and E from MERS or other animal coronaviruses clusters in
different clusters (see Figure 2).
