Abstract

28

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a worldwide pandemic causing

29

significant damage to public health and the economy. Efforts to understand the

30

mechanisms of COVID-19 disease have been hampered by the lack of robust mouse

31

models. To overcome this barrier, we utilized a reverse genetic system to generate a

32

mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2. Incorporating key mutations found in SARSCoV-2

33

variants, this model recapitulates critical elements of human infection including

34

viral replication in the lung, immune cell infiltration, and significant in vivo disease.

35

Importantly, mouse-adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 does not impair replication in human

36

airway cells and maintains antigenicity similar to human SARS-CoV-2 strains. Utilizing this

37

model, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infected mice are protected from lethal challenge with

38

the original SARS-CoV, suggesting immunity from heterologous CoV strains. Together, the

39

results highlight the utility of this mouse model for further study of SARS-CoV-2 infection

40

and disease.

Introduction

43

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-

44

19 disease, emerged in late 2019 and has since caused an ongoing outbreak with over 153

45

million cases and over 3.2 million deaths in the last 17 months1,2. The novel coronavirus, similar

46

to previous emergent SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, can

47

produce severe respiratory disease characterized by fever, labored breathing, pulmonary

48

infiltration and inflammation3,4. In severe cases, SARS-CoV-2 can lead to acute respiratory

49

distress and death. Unlike the earlier pandemic CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 maintains the ability to

50

spread asymptomatically and causes a range of disease from mild to severe5. These factors

51

have led to a world-wide outbreak that continues to rage over a year after its emergence.

52

In responding to the outbreak, understanding the complexity of SARS-CoV-2 infection

53

has been hampered by the limitations of small animal models 6. Early on, wild-type SARS-CoV-

54

2 was shown to be unable to utilize mouse ACE2 for entry and infection 7. Alternative models

55

utilized receptor transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 or Syrian golden hamsters to

56

evaluate SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease in vivo 6. However, the transgenic models, while

57

causing severe disease and lethality, have distinct infection tropism leading to encephalitis in

58

addition to lung disease 8-10. Similarly, while the hamster model has provided utility in studying

59

disease and transmission 11, the absence of genetic knockout and immunological tools limits the

60

types of studies that can be pursued. Without a robust mouse model, many of the resources

61

used to study infection and the immune response are unavailable for SARS-CoV-2 experiments.

62

In order to alleviate these issues, we set out to develop a mouse-adapted strain of

63

SARS-CoV-2 using standard laboratory strains. Building from our infectious clone system 12, we

64

incorporated amino acid changes that facilitated replication in standard Balb/C mice and serially

65

passaged the mutant to create a mouse-adapted strain (CMA3p20) that causes significant

66

weight loss, disease, and lung damage following infection. Notably, virus replication in this

67

model is limited to the respiratory system, thus recapitulating disease observed in most humans.

68

Importantly, the SARS-CoV-2 CMA3p20 strain did not attenuate replication in primary human

69

airway cultures or change the antigenicity of the mouse-adapted strain relative to WT control

70

virus, making it suitable for vaccine and therapeutic studies. Finally, following prior infection with

71

SARS-CoV-2 CMA3p20, mice were protected from lethal challenge with SARS-CoV despite the

72

absence of sterilizing immunity. Together, the results highlight the utility of SARS-CoV-2

73

CMA3p20 to study infection and pathogenesis in standard mouse lines.

Results

77

The initial, emergent strains of SARS-CoV-2 had spike proteins unable to utilize mouse ACE2

78

and infect standard laboratory mice 7. To overcome this barrier, we generated a series of

79

mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 using our infectious clone 12.

80

Our initial efforts modeled the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and mouse ACE2 and used

81

previous mouse adapted strains of SARS-CoV (MA15, MA20, and v2163) 13 to design mutants

82

including changes at Y449H (MA1), Y449H/L455F (MA2), and F486L/Q498Y (MA4) (S. Fig. 1A-

83

C). We also generated a series of mutants based on a reported natural SARS-CoV-2 isolate

84

(MASCP6) capable of infecting mice14, which has spike change at N501Y and several additional

85

mutations (S. Fig. 2A). Given the capacity of the MASCP6 strain to replicate in mice, we

86

generated mutants that had the spike mutation alone (CMA1), the spike/N protein mutation

87

(CMA2), and all four changes (CMA3) (S. Fig. 2A). For each of the six mutants, we utilized site-

88

directed mutagenesis in the WA1 strain clone and rescued virus stocks on Vero E6 cells (S. Fig.

89

2B). We subsequently infected 10-week-old female Balb/C mice with 105 plaque forming units

90

(PFU) of each mutant virus and evaluated replication in the lung 2 days post infection. For WT,

91

MA1, and MA2, no evidence of viable infection was detected in mouse lung tissues (S. Fig. 2C);

92

however, MA4 and CMA1-3 had robust replication in mouse lung suggesting multiple

93

combinations of RBD changes could provide compatibly with mouse ACE2 sufficient for

94

replication in a standard laboratory mouse strain.

95

To further evaluate the mouse adapted strains, we focused on SARS-CoV-2 CMA1,

96

CMA2, and CMA3 mutants over a four-day time course. In female ten-week-old Balb/c mice

97

infected with 105 PFU, none of three mutants induced major disease (S. Fig. 3A), although both

98

CMA2 and CMA3 caused more weight loss than CMA1. Examining viral replication in the lung,

99

all three mutants produced ~105 PFU per lobe at day 2 post infection (S. Fig. 3B). However, no

100

virus was detected at day 4, suggesting rapid clearance by the host. To determine if type I

101

interferon was the major factor blunting infection, IFNAR-/- SJV129 mice were infected with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.03.442357; this version posted May 4, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

102

CMA1, CMA2, and CMA3 at 105 PFU. Following infection, all three CMA mutant strains caused

103

significant disease with both CMA2 and CMA3 peaking at ~10% weight loss (S. Fig. 3C).

104

However, despite increased disease, viral titers were only slightly higher at day 2 than immune

105

competent Balb/c mice and still cleared by day 4 for all three strains (S. Fig. 3D). Together, the

106

results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 CMA1, CMA2, and CMA3 can replicate in both Balb/C and

107

IFNAR-/- mice, but fail to sustain continued replication in vivo.

108

Serial passage of SARS-CoV-2 CMA3

109

In order to generate a SARS-CoV-2 strain that produced significant disease in an

110

immune competent mouse, we serially passaged SARS-CoV-2 CMA3 in 10-week-old Balb/c

111

mice. A single mouse was infected with 105 PFU of CMA3 (p0); the mouse was subsequently

112

euthanized at 1 day post infection with half the lung lobes taken for viral RNA and the other

113

lobes homogenized, clarified, and used to inoculate subsequent passages (Fig. 1A); lung

114

samples were titered by plaque assay to verify continued SARS-CoV-2 replication (Fig. 1B).

115

After passages (p) 10, 15, and 20, stock viruses were generated on Vero E6 cells, used to infect

116

10-week-old Balb/C mice, and compared to the disease caused by the original CMA3 p0 strain

117

(Fig. 1C). Following 105 PFU challenge, mice infected with p10 and p15 were found to have

118

augmented weight loss compared to p0; however, mice infected with p20 showed 10% weight

119

loss by day 3 and signs of disease including ruffled fur and hunched posture. We subsequently

120

deep sequenced the passaged virus from the lung RNA and identified two additional spike

121

mutations (K417N and H655Y) and a mutation in the E protein (E8V). Several other mutations

122

were also found as minority variants in the spike and in other parts of the genome. Modeling

123

the receptor binding domain interaction (Fig. 1D), K417N and N501Y likely improve binding to

124

mouse ACE2 and facilitate increased in vivo disease. Together, mouse adaptation of SARS-

125

CoV-2 CMA3 incorporated three additional fixed mutations that drive increased disease in mice.

127

Having observed significant disease in mice infected with CMA3p20 relative to the initial strain

128

of CMA3, we next evaluated weight loss, viral replication, and histopathology in Balb/c mice.

129

First, we tested CMA3p20 for a dose-dependent impact on weight loss (S. Fig. 4A); both 106

130

and 105 PFU caused significant, dose-dependent weight loss with minimal disease observed in

131

the 104 challenge. We also compared CMA3p20 infection associated weight loss to a B.1.1.7

132

SARS-CoV-2 variant (UK) which contains the N501Y mutation that permits virus replication in

133

mice (S. Fig. 3A-D). After challenge with the 106 PFU of the B.1.1.7 variant, female Balb/C

134

mice lost approximately 10% of their starting weight by day 2 and recovered (S. Fig. 4B).

135

Together, the results indicate more severe disease with the mouse adapted CMA3p20 than the

136

B.1.1.7 variant.

137

We subsequently used the 105 PFU dose of CMA3p20 to examine infection compared

138

to SARS-CoV-2 CMA3 over a seven-day time course. Following infection, 10-week-old female

139

Balb/C mice CMA3p20-infected mice lost significant weight over the first four days, peaking at

140

day 3 with >10% weight loss (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the original CMA3 caused minimal weight

141

loss over the course of the seven-day infection. We next examined viral replication in the lung at

142

days 2, 4, and 7 post infection (Fig. 2B). CMA3p20 infection had a significant 0.5 log increase

143

in viral load over CMA3 in the lung at day 2; this difference was diminished at day 4 (0.25 log

144

increase, not statically significant) and both virus strains were cleared by day 7 in the lung. We

145

also observed day 2 replication in the trachea of mice that was cleared by day 4 in both CMA3

146

and CMA3p20 infection (Fig. 2C). Together, the data demonstrate robust weight loss and clear

147

replication in the mouse respiratory tract.

148

We next evaluated SARS-CoV-2 replication in non-respiratory tissues. Following

149

infection, we noted replication in the heart tissue of a subset of animals at day 2 (Fig. 2D).

150

However, infection was transient and not uniform in all animals and no virus was detected in the

151

heart at later time points. We subsequently evaluated viral load in the brain and blood and

152

found no evidence for CMA3 or CMA3p20 infection by plaque assay (Fig. 2E-F). To further

153

verify viral replication, we also examined viral RNA expression in the lung, heart, brain, spleen,

154

and liver (S. Fig. 4C). While robust viral RNA was observed in the lung, the other tissues had

155

minimal evidence for CMA3p20 replication. Together, the data indicate that the SARS-CoV-2

156

CMA3p20 strain is primarily restricted to and disease driven by virus replication in the

157

respiratory tract.

158

CMA3p20 induces significant immune infiltration and lung damage.

159

Further examining lung tissue, histopathology analysis of CMA3p20 infection indicated robust

160

virus replication, immune infiltration, and tissue damage. Utilizing antigen staining against the N

161

protein, we saw evidence for viral replication primarily in the bronchioles with additional staining

162

in the lung parenchyma at day 2 post infection (Fig. 2G). We also observed lung infiltration and

163

inflammation following CMA3p20 challenge characterized by peribronchioloitis, perivascular

164

cuffing, and perivasculitis by day 2 post infection (Fig. 2H). Similarly, at day 4, we noted

165

collapsed airways and interstitial pneumonia (Fig. 2I). Some portions of the day 4 lungs

166

infected with CMA3p20 also had virus induced damage including enlarged and multinucleated

167

alveolar type II cells (S. Fig. 5A), loss of cellular polarity (S. Fig. 5B), and immune cells in the

168

bronchiolar lumen (S. Fig. 5D). Together, the histopathology results demonstrated significant

169

damage, inflammation, and disease in the lung following infection with SARS-CoV-2 CMA3p20.

178

results indicate that mouse adaption resulted in no significant replication attenuation of

179

CMA3p20 in primary human airway cells.

180

CMA3p20 retains antigenicity similar to WT SARS-CoV-2.

181

In addition to differences in replication in human cells, spike changes in SARS-CoV-2 could alter

182

the overall antigenicity of CMA3p20 as compared to SARS-CoV-2 derived from humans; this

183

result would make it more difficult to interpret vaccine and protection studies derived from mice.

184

Therefore, to evaluate antigenicity, we infected 10-week-old female Balb/C mice with 106 PFU of

185

CMA3p20, then, euthanized and harvested sera 28 days post infection. We subsequently used

186

the mouse sera to measure plaque reduction neuralization titer (PRNT50) against the wild-type

187

SARS-CoV-2 WA1 strain (Fig. 3C). Mouse sera from mice (n=7) infected with CMA3p20

188

neutralized WT SARS-CoV-2 with a PRNT50 value of ~1/600. To further evaluate CMA3p20

189

antigenicity, we examined PRNT50 assays utilizing sera from acutely infected COVID-19

190

patients (Fig. 3D). Performing neutralization assays in parallel, we found that CMA3p20 had

191

PRNT50 values similar to WT SARS-CoV-2 with each COVID19 patient serum tested. With a R2

192

value of 0.8651 over the 13 samples, the results indicated that CMA3p20 retains similar

193

antigenicity to the WT SARS-CoV-2 and has utility for vaccine and protection studies.

194

To further demonstrate the utility of CMA3p20 to understand in vivo protection, we

195

performed a passive transfer experiment with COVID-19 patient sera. One day prior to

196

infection, 10-week-old female BALB/C mice were pre-treated intraperitoneally with either control

197

(PBS) or 100ul of convalescent serum from a COVID-19 patient. Mice were subsequently

198

challenged with 105 PFU of CMA3p20 and monitored for weight loss and viral titer. Mice treated

199

with acutely infected COVID-19 patient serum had significantly reduced weight loss at day 3 and

200

4 post infection as compared to control mice (Fig. 3E). Similarly, viral titers in the lung were

201

reduced at both day 2 and day 4 in mice receiving COVID-19 patient serum as compared to

202

control. Consistent with the PRNT50 data (Fig. 3D), the results from the passive transfer

203

experiment demonstrate that antibody-based immunity generated following human infection can

204

effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2 CMA3p20. Together, the results confirm similar antigenicity

205

of CMA3p20 and WT SARS-CoV-2.

206

Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection protects from lethal SARS-CoV challenge.

207

Having established a SARS-CoV-2 mouse model with significant disease, we next evaluated the

208

capacity of CMA3p20 to protect against heterologous SARS-CoV challenge. Ten-week-old

209

female Balb/c mice were infected with 106 PFU of CMA3p20 or control (PBS), monitored for

210

weight loss, and allowed to recover. CMA3p20 infected and control mice were subsequently

211

challenged with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (104 PFU) 17. Control mice infected

212

with SARS-CoV MA15 had rapid weight loss and lethality with all mice reaching euthanasia

213

criteria by day four post infection (Fig. 4A & B). In contrast, mice previously infected with

214

SARS-CoV-2 CMA3p20 had less weight loss compared to controls, only losing approximately

215

10% of their starting weight by day 2. The CMA3p20-infected mice recovered their starting

216

weight at late times demonstrating protection from lethal SARS-CoV infection. Examining

217

disease score, mice previously infect with SARS-CoV-2 CMA3p20 showed some disease at day

218

2, but were generally devoid of ruffled fur, diminished movement, or hunching (Fig. 4C). In

219

contrast, the mock infected animals challenged with SARS-CoV showed significant disease that

220

escalated over the course of infection and required euthanasia by day 4 for all animals

221

remaining in the study (n=10). For both CMA3p20 infected and uninfected animals, robust

222

SARS-CoV replication was observed in the lung (Fig. 4D). However, mice infected with

223

CMA3p20 has a significant reduction in viral loads as compared to control animals. Yet, the

224

viral replication indicates sterilizing immunity was not achieved. We subsequently evaluated the

225

neutralization capacity of SARS-CoV-2 CMA3p20 sera against SARS-CoV (Fig. 4E). CMA3p20

226

mouse sera from pre-challenge, day 2, day 4, and 7 post SARS-CoV infection were able to

227

neutralize SARS-CoV with a low range of PRNT50 values (Fig. 4F). Both the pre-challenge and

228

day 2 post challenge sera had neutralization levels <1/150, while day 4 and 7 post-challenge

229

sera were only augmented to ~1/200. While significantly less neutralization than what is

observed against WT SARS-CoV-2 (~1/600), the results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 CMA3p20

Discussion

234

In this manuscript, we utilized a reverse genetic system 18 and in vivo adaptation to generate a

235

mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2 (CMA3p20). CMA3p20 induces a dose-dependent

236

disease in young, female Balb/C mice with viral replication limited primarily to the respiratory

237

tract. In addition, CMA3p20 infection causes substantial damage to the mouse lung with

238

significant inflammation, immune infiltration, and pneumonia. Importantly, mutations in

239

CMA3p20 do not alter its ability to infect primary human cell airway cells, and the mouse

240

adapted strain maintains similar antigenicity to wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Utilizing this model, we

241

demonstrated infection with SARS-CoV-2 CMA3p20 provided protection from lethal challenge

242

with the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV. Together, results indicate the utility of CMA3p20 as a

243

model to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and immunity in standard inbred mice.

244

With the threat posed by SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants, questions have been

245

raised on the efficacy and duration of immunity following natural infection 19,20. Based on the

246

protection provided by prior SARS-CoV-2 challenge against the heterologous SARS-CoV, our

247

results suggest immunity is more complex than neutralizing serum titer alone. While sera from

248

mice challenged with SARS-CoV-2 CMA3p20 neutralizes SARS-CoV at ~1/150, this level of

249

antibody does not provide sterilizing immunity in the lung. Even after SARS-CoV infection, the

250

serum neutralization is only ~1/200 at day 7 post infection. Yet, in terms of weight loss and

251

disease, the SARS-CoV-2 infected mice showed a significant reduction in severity and complete

252

protection from SARS-CoV-induced lethality.

253

From these initial findings, the exact mechanism of protection is not yet clear. With

254

previous studies with SARS-CoV, antibody-based immunity has led to complete protection from

255

viral replication in the lung 21,22. Similar findings have been observed in animal models of

256

SARS-CoV-2, leading to serum neutralization as a primary correlate associated with protection

257

23

258

Notably, initial findings have found non-neutralizing antibody responses against common cold

. However, studies with SARS-CoV have also implicated a role for cellular based immunity 24.

259

CoV had some level of protection 25. Importantly, the vast majority of T-cell studies have found

260

epitopes directed against the more conserved nucleocapsid protein 25. Absent in most vaccine

261

platforms, it is unclear if the immunity stimulated by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection will mimic

262

vaccine induced immunity and offer protection against heterologous SARS-CoV challenge.

263

In regard to the mouse adapted strain, CMA3p20, several of the key mutations in the

264

spike protein have been observed in novel SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern 26. Starting with the

265

spike mutations, N501Y is represented in several COVID-19 variants of concern, found in 29%

266

of the GSAID database of reported sequences, and has been shown to improve binding to

267

human ACE2 27. In these studies, N501Y alone (CMA1) permits SARS-CoV-2 to replicate in

268

Balb/c mice. Similarly, spike mutation K417N, also found in several variants of concern, likely

269

augments receptor binding and drives in vivo disease 28. In contrast to the other spike

270

mutations, H655Y is outside the RBD, has low penetrance in GSAID sequences (<0.5%), and

271

does not have a clear functional impact 28. Outside the spike changes, the other mutations

272

found in CMA3p20 are not clear in their impact. Mutations in NSP8, NSP10 (<0.5%), and E

273

protein are rarely found in GSAID reported sequences, are not in conserved domains, and may

274

be hitchhiking mutations 29. Notably, NSP6 (L37F) has been in observed in 4% of human SARS-

275

CoV-2 isolates, suggesting possible selection 29. Similarly, while N change at 128 is not

276

common 28, differences in disease between CMA2 and CMA1 suggesting a role in

277

pathogenesis.

278

While the mouse-adapted mutations in CMA3p20 render a pathogenic virus in mice, it

279

does not ablate the replication capacity in human cells or antigenicity relative to the wild-type

280

SARS-CoV-2 strains. Previously described mouse adapted strains have been shown to cause

281

significant disease but lose replication capacity in primary human airway cultures 15. In these

282

studies, CMA3p20 has similar replication levels as SARS-CoV-2 WA1 in primary HAE cultures.

283

In addition, CMA3p20-infected mice generate antibody responses capable of neutralizing wild-

284

type SARS-CoV-2 WA1 and the mouse-adapted strain is similarly neutralized by COVID-19

285

sera. Importantly, passive transfer of human convalescent sera reduced disease in mice

286

challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Together, the results indicate that CMA3p20 induces a robust

287

immune response similar to that seen in humans and useful for understanding immunity in

288

standard animal models.

In vitro infection. Viral infections in primary human airway cells were performed as previously

465

described 37. Briefly, the apical side of the HAE cultures were washed 3 times with PBS. Cultures

466

were infected with SARS-CoV-2 WT (WA1) or CMA3p20 at MOI 0.01 and allowed to adsorb for

467

1 hr at 37°C. After adsorption, the apical side was washed 3 times with PBS, and the basolateral

468

media replaced. Viral washes were collected adding PBS to the apical side and incubated for 30

469

minutes at 37°C. Viral titer was evaluated by focus forming assay as previously described

470

RNA from HAE were collected at 48 hours post infection. RNA was harvested from mock-infected

471

and infected HAE cultures by treating with RNA lysis buffer for >5 min and gently pipetting to

472

recover cells. Total RNA was extracted using the Zymo Quick-RNA miniprep kit (VWR; R1055)

473

according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Purified RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using

474

the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher, 43-688-13). RNA levels were

475

quantified using the IDT Prime Time gene expression master mix and TaqMan gene expression

biological replicates were harvested at each described time and results are representative of

481

multiple experiments. No blinding was used in any sample collections, nor were samples

482

randomized. Microsoft Excel for Mac 2011 was used to analyze data.

483

Deep sequencing analysis. RNA libraries of SARS-CoV-2 mutants were prepared with 300 ng

484

of RNA using the Tiled-ClickSeq protocol as previously described 38,39 using tiled primers cognate

485

to the SARS-CoV-2 genome (accession number NC_045512.2) and the TruSeq i7 LT adapter

486

series and i5 hexamer adaptors containing a 12N unique molecular identifier (UMI). Libraries were

487

sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform with MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 using paired-end reads

488

(R1:250 cycles, R2:50 cycles). Raw data was de-multiplexed using TruSeq indexes using the

489

MiSeq Reporter Software. Demultiplexed read data were quality filtered, adaptor-trimmed and

490

primer-trimmed as previously described

491

(NC_045512.2) using ViReMa

492

molecular identifiers (UMIs) embedded in the i5 click-adaptor. A consensus reference sequence

493

was generated using Pilon42 ensuring that read coverage was greater than 25x across 99.5% of

494

the reference genome. Pileup files were generated using Samtools v1.9

495

were extracted by nucleotide voting (PHRED>=30) using a custom python3 script previously

496

described 39.

505

for NT50 calculation. The PRNT assay was performed at the BSL-3 facility at UTMB.

506

Ethic Statement. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations for care

507

and use of animals by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, National Institutes of Health. The

508

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of University of Texas Medical Branch

509

(UTMB) approved the animal studies under protocol 1711065 and 1707046. For samples Emory

510

University, collection and processing were performed under approval from the University

511

Institutional Review Board (IRB #00001080 and #00022371). Adults ≥18 years were enrolled who

512

met eligibility criteria for SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR or rapid antigen test confirmed by a

513

commercially available assay) and provided informed consent.

514

Human Serum samples

515

For Emory University, acute peripheral blood samples were collected from hospitalized patients

516

at the time of enrollment. Infected patients were randomly selected from a convenience sample

517

and no data was collected on the number of patients that were pre-screened or declined

518

participation. All patients enrolled in July 2020 and had a mean age of 57 (range: 26-85; 50%

519

male). Samples were collected in the first 9 days (range: 2-9) of their hospital stay (range: 3-33

520

days) and mostly 1-2 weeks after symptom onset (range 5-19 days), the majority of the patients

521

had comorbid conditions (n=16) with 19 out of 20 having severe disease and one patient had

522

moderate disease. All of these patients had radiological evidence of pneumonia; 19 out of the 20

523

patients required supplemental oxygen, and 4 out of 20 patients were admitted to the intensive

524

care unit (ICU). Three enrolled patients died of COVID-19.

525

Mice and in vivo infection. Ten-week-old BALB/C mice were purchased from Charles River

526

Laboratories and were maintained in SealsafeTM HEPA-filtered air in/out units. Prior to infection,

527

animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and infected intranasally (IN) with 104 to 106 plaque

528

forming units diluted 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Infected animals were monitored

529

for weight loss, morbidity, and clinical signs of disease, and lung titers were determined as

530

described previously 45. Infected animals were weighed daily, and lung tissue collected 2-, 4- and

531

7-days post infection for downstream analysis by plaque assay.

532

Real-Time PCR for Viral RNA. RNA from tissues were collected using RNA later (). Samples

533

were subsequently homogenized with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was then extracted from

534

Triazol using the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus kit (Zymo Research #R2072) per the

535

manufacturer’s instruction. Extracted RNA was then converted to cDNA with the iScript cDNA

536

Synthesis kit (BioRad #1708891). Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed with the

537

Luna Universal qPCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs #M3003) on a CFX Connect instrument

538

(BioRad #1855200). Primer 1 (Forward - AAT GTT TTT CAA ACA CGT GCA G and Primer 2

539

(Reverse - TAC ACT ACG TGC CCG CCG AGG) were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 genomes. A

540

primer annealing temperature of 63°C was used for all assays.

541

Histological Analysis. The left lung was removed and submerged in 10% buffered formalin

542

(Fisher) without inflation for 1 week. Lungs from mice sacrificed on day 2 and day 4 were fixed in

543

formalin and paraffin embedded. Five-micron serial sections were taken and used for

544

histopathological staining with hematoxylin and eosin and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay.

545

IHC was conducted using rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid

546

protein (clone NB100-56576 [1:100], Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) and biotinylated anti-rabbit

547

IgG, streptavidin AP (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) with Permanent Red chromogen

548

(Dako/Agilent, Santa Clara CA). Normal rabbit serum was used as primary antibody for the

549

negative control. Briefly, the sections were deparaffinized by immersion in three xylene baths for

550

5 minutes each. The slides were rehydrated by immersion in a series of alcohol baths ranging

551

from 100 to 95% for 5 minutes each. The slides were pretreated with a citrate-based buffer, pH

552

6.0 at 98 0 C for heat-induced epitope retrieval. Endogenous avidin and biotin sites were blocked

553

using avidin/biotin blocking kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). The slides were incubated with anti-

554

SARS-CoV antibody for one hour at room temperature, washed in 1X Tris-buffered saline (TBS),

555

0.05% Tween 20 (wash buffer), and incubated with goat biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (H + L)
