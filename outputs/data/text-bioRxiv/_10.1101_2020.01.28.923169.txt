Summary
Background: The 2019 new coronavirus, "2019-nCoV", was discovered from Wuhan
Viral Pneumonia cases in December 2019, and was named by the World Health
Organization on January 12, 2020. In the early stage, people knows little about the
2019-nCoV virus was not clear, and the spread period was encountering China's annual
spring migration, which made the epidemic spread rapidly from Wuhan to almost all
provinces in China.
Methods: This study builds a SEIRD model that considers the movement of people
across regions, revealing the effects of three measures on controlling the spread of the
epidemic.Based on MATLAB R2017a, computational experiments were performed to
simulate the epidemic prevention and control measures.
Findings: The research results show that current prevention and control measures in
China are very necessary. This study further validates the concerns of international and
domestic experts regarding asymptomatic transmission (E-status).
Interpretation: The results of this study are applicable to explore the impact of the
implementation of relevant measures on the prevention and control of epidemic spread,
and to identify key individuals that may exist during the spread of the epidemic.

1 Introduction
The 2019 new coronavirus, "2019-nCoV", was discovered from Wuhan Viral
Pneumonia cases in December 2019, and was named by the World Health Organization
on January 12, 2020. In the early stage, people knows little about the 2019-nCoV virus
was not clear, and the spread period was encountering China's annual spring migration,
which made the epidemic spread rapidly from Wuhan to almost all provinces in China.
As of 20:30 on January 27, 2020, 2844 cases were confirmed nationwide, 5794 were
suspected, 58 were cured, and 81 died. Such a major epidemic is a serious challenge to
people's lives and an important test of public health emergency management
capabilities.
In recent days, domestic and foreign scholars have published research results about new
coronaviruses online, and some of them are non-medical scholars who use mathematics
and computer technology to simulate and predict disease transmission. Scholars from
the field of public health present a timely evaluation of the Chinese 2019-nCov
epidemic in its initial phase[1]. Different from the existing studies, this study taking
into account the new characteristics of new coronaviruses and the current epidemic
prevention and control measures in China, and constructing a SEIRD model that
considers the movement of people across regions. The purpose of this study is to reveal
the role of the three most important current measures to control the spread of the
epidemic, such as quarantine of infected persons, reduction of human mobility, and
improvement of treatment.

2 Model
The warehouse model was proposed by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927. According
to the characteristics of actual transmission behavior, there can be multiple states of an
individual. The two most basic states are Susceptible (S) and Infected (Infected, I).
According to the types of individual states included in the model, classic warehouse
models such as SI model[2], SIS model[3], SIR model[4], and SEIR model [5]. The SI
model is a basic model, and other warehouse models are derived models built according

to research needs. The SEIR model considers Exposed, that is, vulnerable individuals
are infected, but they cannot infect other vulnerable individuals within a certain
incubation period.
On the basis of the SIR model, considering that 2019-nCoV is an infectious disease
with a latent period, the E (Exposed) state and D (Death) state are added to construct
the SEIRD propagation model. The schematic diagram of the SEIRD propagation
model is shown in figure 1.

Figure 1. SEIRD model
The members in this model mainly have the following four conversion methods.


First, S → E. Relevant evidence shows that during the 2019-nCoV infection
process, not only confirmed patients have infectious capacity, but also those
asymptomatic transmission individuals also have the ability to infect others.
Therefore, in the SEIRD model, the susceptible status (S) will change to a Exposed
status (E) with a certain probability after contacting the infected individual (I) or
the Exposed individual (E).



Second, E → I. Relevant evidence shows that the longest incubation period for
2019-nCoV is 14 days and the shortest is 1 day. The Exposed status (E) may be
transformed into an infected status (I) after the incubation period.



Third, I → R. The infected individual (I) will be isolated and treated with a certain
probability in hospital and will change to the R status.



Fourth, I → D. Relevant evidence shows that infected patients die after 15 days
without effective treatment.

During the 2019-nCoV transmission, the movement of individuals in the I and E status
caused a rapid spread of the epidemic. Therefore, during the spread of the epidemic,
consideration should be given to the contagion caused by individuals moving in

different regions / communities / urbans. Suppose there are NU members in a twodimensional space. In the initial stage, NU members are randomly and uniformly
distributed in NC * NC communities (also can be understood as cities), that is, each
community has NU / (NC * NC) people. For members located in the two-dimensional
space, each time step (which can be understood as daily) moves to the neighbor
community with a probability of M (u, t). Therefore, for individuals in different
community, there are five possible directions for movement: no movement, up, down,
left, and right(Figure 2).

This paper conducts three experiments


Frist, isolate the infected. In this study, the effect of isolation measures for infected
people is that from the time TI, the individual in I status stopped moving and will
be isolated and treated by hospital.



Second, reduce individuals’ across communities move. In this study, measures to
reduce individuals’ move is that from the time MT, reduction in the probability
(MU)of all personnel going to other communities.



Third, improve the level of treatment. In this study, the measures to improve the
level of treatment is that from the time of implementation of treatment(PT), all
individuals in I status will be isolated and treated with probability PI.

4 Simulation of infected isolation measures
In this study, the isolation measures refer to that from the time of publication TI,
individuals in I-status stop moving and are isolated and treated by the hospital.
Fixed relevant parameters (MU = 0.25, MT = 1, PI = 0.1, PT = 40), simulate the
implementation of quarantine measures at four time points of TI = 10, 20, 30, 40 after
the outbreak, and observe individual proportion changes of E and I status (Figure 3).
It can be found that with the isolation measures implemented at four time points, the Estatus user changes are not obvious. The possible reason is that this isolation is only
implemented for I-status users, but one of the characteristics of 2019-nCoV is that not
only I-status is contagious, but E-status is also contagious. Although the I-status is being
treated in isolation, there are still many members of the E-status in the incubation period.
These members make the disease likely to continue to spread. This explains that the

government requires that people who share a bus, a flight, or a train with the infected
person need to isolate themselves. These individuals may have changed to the E-status
because they had been in the same space with the I-status individuals.
It can be found that with the implementation of isolation measures at four time points,
the I-status user has changed significantly. The change is reflected in that the sooner the
isolation measures are implemented, the lower the proportion of I-status users remains,
and the shorter the time it takes for the proportion of I-status users to decrease to zero.
For example, the peak value of I-status personnel is 10% at TI = 10, and the peak value
of I-status personnel is 95% at TI = 40 and decreases to 0 at t = 45.

Figure 3. E and I-status under infected person isolation measures
Individuals with infectious capacity (in E status and I status) are the key to the control
of infectious diseases, but the number of deaths (in D status) is also an important
manifestation of the epidemic hazard and social prevention and control capabilities.
Take TI = 40 as an example, observe the proportion of D-status users in the initial
community in each time period (Figure 4). At t = 20, only D-status individuals appear
in the central community and surrounding neighborhoods. When t = 30, D-status
individuals also appeared in a larger range of surrounding communities, but the
proportion was still the highest in the central community, and the surrounding
communities gradually decreased. When t = 40, the proportion of D-status individuals
in the central community has reached 80%. When t = 50 (evolution into a steady state),
many communities face up to 80% of D-status individuals. The epidemic evolution is
centered with the central community. The larger the radius, the lower the D-status ratio.

Due to the implementation of prevention and control measures, it will eventually enter
a steady state, that is, there will no longer be new D-status users in all communities.

4 Simulation of reduce individuals move measures
Starting at 10:00 on January 23, 2020, Wuhan and surrounding cities announced the
suspension of public transportation services to prevent the spread of new coronavirus
epidemics. In this study, measures to reduce personnel mobility are reflected in the
reduction in the probability (MU) of individuals going to other communities, from the
time of release MT.
Fix the relevant parameters (PI = 0.1, PT = 40, TI = 200), and simulate the impact of
individual mobility measures on the spread of the epidemic after the outbreak (MT =
10,20). The degree of reduction includes 0.1 (10% probability of going to neighboring
communities) and 0.01 (1% probability of going to neighboring communities, similar
to the city closure policy). Observe the changes in the proportion of individuals in the

E and I-status (Figure 5).
It can be found that the implementation of population mobility control at two time
points (MT = 10,20) and the different degree of population mobility control (MU =
0.1,0.01), the proportion of E-status users has changed significantly. The earlier the
implementation time, the higher the degree of control, the lower the peak value of the
proportion of E-status users (such as MU = 0.01, MT = 10, the peak value is 20%). In
contrast, if this measure is implemented late (MT = 20), the influence of different levels
of flow control measures on the proportion of E-status users is not obvious (such as MU
= 0.01, 0.1, the peaks are close to 50 %). Therefore, in order to reduce the proportion
of E-status users, measures to reduce population mobility should be implemented as
soon as possible. If it is implemented later, even the closure of the city may be difficult
to achieve significant results.
It can be found that the implementation of population mobility control at two points in
time, and the difference in the degree of population mobility control, the proportion of
I-status users has changed significantly. A conclusion similar to that of the E-status is
obtained, that is, in order to reduce the proportion of the I-status users, measures to
reduce population mobility should be implemented as soon as possible.

Figure 5. E and I-status under reduce individuals move measures
In order to compare the proportion of D-status users under different flow control
measures, take two time stage t = 30 and t = 50 (evolving into steady state) as examples,
and observe the changes in D-status users in 81 communities in the two groups (high
measures,MU = 0.01, MT = 10; low measures,MU = 0.1, MT = 20) (Figure 6). At t =

30, compared with the low-measure group, the proportion of D-status in the highmeasure group (MU = 0.01, MT = 10) was lower. When t = 50, compared with the lowmeasure group (the percentage of D-status in almost all communities exceeds 50%), the
range of the D-status ratio in the high-measure group is [0.5-1]. Areas above 100%
(gray) appear at t = 50, which is because the random flow of people makes the number
of people in some communities higher than the initial stage. This result further validates
that "the sooner, the higher the degree of implementation of the measures to reduce the
movement of people, the better the effect of controlling the spread of the epidemic."

In this study, measures to improve the level of treatment means that from the time when
treatment is implemented(PT), all individuals in the I state will be isolated and treated
with probability PI. Fix the relevant parameters (MU = 0.25, MT = 1, TI = 200), and
simulate the implementation of measures to improve treatment level at two time stages:
MT = 10,20 after the outbreak. The treatment level includes 0.3 (low treatment level)

Figure 7. E and I-status under improve treatment measures
From the perspective of the proportion of E-status individuals, the peak of the
proportion of E-status individuals did not change significantly in the four groups. This
may be because although the I-status individuals have been isolated and treated, there
are still a large number of E-status individuals in the population. These individuals also
have the ability to infect, that is, the ability to make other S-status individuals into Estate individuals.
From the perspective of the proportion of individuals in the I state, the peak of the
proportion of individuals in the E-status changed significantly in the four groups.
Among them, the group with a high level of treatment (PI = 0.7) and the early start of
treatment (PT = 10) had a lower proportion of I-status individuals, and the peak
appeared earlier. Therefore, starting early isolation and treatment of I-status individuals
and continuously improving the level of treatment (more I-status individuals can be
treated) will help reduce the proportion of I-status individuals in the population. Such
findings explain why it is necessary to coordinate national medical science and
technology resources to support Wuhan, and why it is necessary to build Leishenshan
Hospital and Huoshenshan Hospital, because improving treatment levels as soon as
possible is an important way to reduce the spread of the epidemic.

This study builds a SEIRD model that considers the movement of people across regions,
revealing the effects of three measures (quarantine of infected people, reduction of
movement of people, and improvement of treatment) on controlling the spread of the
epidemic. The research results show that current prevention and control measures in
China are very necessary. The results of this study are applicable to explore the impact
of the implementation of relevant measures on the prevention and control of epidemic
spread, and to identify key individuals that may exist during the spread of the epidemic.
This study further validates the concerns of international and domestic experts
regarding asymptomatic transmission (ie, E-status in this article). This article suggests
that as long as medical resources are available, E-status individuals or potential E-status
individuals should be included in the scope of isolation and treatment. The government
should promptly release information on the epidemic situation, as well as information
on the areas and vehicles used by the infected people, to further encourage those who
have been in contact with individuals in the I or E-status to go to nearby hospitals for
timely inspection.
