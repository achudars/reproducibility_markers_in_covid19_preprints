ABSTRACT

44

Background: SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have emerged from an animal reservoir as a zoonotic

45

pathogen. Over the course of the current pandemic, evidence has mounted that infected

46

humans can transmit the virus to animals including household pets, however the frequency of

47

and risk factors for this transmission remain unclear. We carried out a community-based study

48

of pets in households with one or more confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case among the human

49

residents, and report here on interim findings from sampling of dogs.

50

Methods: Data collection included a survey of human and animal demographic and clinical

51

variables, features of their shared environment, and human-animal contact; blood collection

52

from animals for serology for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; and nasopharyngeal sampling for

53

PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2.

54

Results: Sampling consisted of 67 dogs from 46 households. Nasopharyngeal PCR testing results

55

were available for 58 dogs, and serological testing results were available for 51. Clinical signs

56

consistent with COVID-19 were reported in 14 dogs (23.7%, 95% CI 0.13, 0.35), and SARS-CoV-2

57

antibody testing using viral receptor binding domain ELISA was positive in 22 dogs (43.1%, 95%

58

CI 0.30, 0.57). All PCR tests of nasopharyngeal swabs were negative. Survey respondents

59

commonly reported close human-animal contact, and the majority of households were aware

60

of and adopted measures to mitigate human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 following

61

diagnosis. While no statistically significant associations were detected between human-animal

62

contact variables and either seropositivity or COVID-19 like illness in dogs, positive trends were

63

found for sharing beds with humans and the number of SARS-CoV-2 positive humans in the

64

corresponding household. Reported measures taken by the household to mitigate transmission

65

showed a protective trend, and COVID-19 like illness in a dog was positively associated with

66

seropositivity in that dog.

67

Discussion: These data indicate that human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in

68

households is common, in a study population characterized by close human-animal contact.

69

They also indicate that infected pets often manifest signs of COVID-like illness. While

70

nasopoharyngeal sampling of dogs in this study has not to date demonstrated positive PCR

71

results, this could be due to delays in sampling. Household members reported taking

72

precautions to protect pets from SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating an opportunity for further

73

measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between people and animals sharing

74

households.

BACKGROUND

80

Coronaviruses occur in multiple mammalian species, and SARS-CoV-2 virus, the etiological

81

agent of COVID-19 infection, is thought to have jumped to humans from a mammalian source

82

[1]. While currently the virus is spreading person to person, the ACE2 receptor involved in SARS-

83

CoV-2 transmission is present in multiple species and there are numerous anecdotal reports of

84

companion animals becoming infected, including dogs and cats. At the date of this writing, 76

85

cats and 51 dogs in the USA have been reported by USDA-APHIS to have confirmed SARS-CoV-2

86

infection based on PCR or antibody testing. Workplace transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between

87

humans and animals has also been documented, including in zoos (felids and non-human

88

primates) and on mink farms [2,3]. This is consistent with previous reports of SARS-CoV-1

89

infecting cats and ferrets, as well as laboratory studies demonstrating experimental SARS-CoV-

90

2 infection of non-human primates, ferrets, hamsters, and rabbits [4]. Less is known, however,

91

about the frequency of and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between humans and

92

companion animals in a household setting. Furthermore, the natural history of COVID-19

93

infection in pets is poorly understood.

94

Given the close contact many people have with their pets and the intimate nature of

95

their shared environment, in particular during periods of quarantine or isolation, it is important

96

to better understand the role of companion animals in community infection patterns, including

97

whether such transmission contributes to virus evolution and emergence of novel strains. In

98

light of evidence from mink farms that animal-origin variants may contain spike mutations and

99

other changes that could affect clinical features of infection[5,6], ongoing monitoring of SARS-

100

CoV-2 transmission between humans and animals in household and other human-animal

101

contact settings remains critical.

102

We report interim findings from the COVID and Pets Study (CAPS), a cross-sectional

103

community-based study of animals in households of persons with documented COVID-19

104

infection conducted from 2020 to 2021 in Washington and Idaho. The goal of the study is to

105

describe the frequency of transmission between humans and animals within a household, and

106

to determine human, animal, and environmental risk factors for that transmission, in a One

107

Health framework.

108
109

METHODS

110

The COHERE [7] and STROBE [8] statements were used to guide reporting of the findings and

111

the preparation of this manuscript.

112

Study population

113

We recruited households for this study, defining a household as one or more persons ages 18

114

or older, co-housing, or co-sheltering in the case of unhoused individuals, with at least one pet

115

that does not live solely outdoors. Pets were defined as dogs, cats, ferrets, and hamsters based

116

on prior research documenting experimental COVID-19 infection in these species [9,10].

117

We conducted this study in King, Snohomish, Yakima, Whitman, Pierce, Spokane, and

118

Benton counties in Washington, and Latah County in Idaho. Enrollment began in April 2020, and

119

continues at the time of publication.

121

CAPS is a cross-sectional study with individual- and household-level data collection, with a

122

longitudinal component for households with PCR positive pets. Study participation involved

123

two components, detailed below: an online survey followed by animal sampling.

124

Study team

125

Our study team was comprised of veterinarians, microbiologists, physicians, epidemiologists,

126

environmental health experts, and medical anthropologists from the University of Washington’s

127

Center for One Health Research, and Washington State University’s College of Veterinary

128

Medicine, Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, and Paul G. Allen School for

129

Global Health.

130

Recruitment and eligibility

131

Households were recruited through partnerships with other COVID-19 clinical trials, social

132

media, word of mouth and through community partners. Individuals were screened for

133

eligibility using the UW Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system [11], a HIPAA-

134

compliant web tool for clinical research, with criteria including county of residence, pet

135

ownership, and one or more household member with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

136

During eligibility screening participants were asked to confirm that any animals to be

137

sampled were up to date on their rabies vaccination, and were suitable for sampling based on

138

knowledge of that pet’s behavior when receiving veterinary care. Animals with known fearful

139

and/or aggressive behavior in response to restraint were excluded from sampling, however the

140

corresponding household was not excluded from completing the REDCap survey, nor from

141

animal sampling if other animals residing in the household were amenable to sampling.

143

This study and its protocols received ethical approval from the University of Washington’s

144

Institutional Review Board STUDY00010585) and Office of Animal Welfare (PROTO201600308:

145

4355-01). Informed consent was obtained from human subjects via REDCap, or over the phone

146

with the study coordinator if preferred by the participant, after the nature and possible

147

consequences of study involvement had been explained. Once eligibility was confirmed and

148

consent was obtained, individuals then completed the online survey.

149

Survey

150

A comprehensive survey was completed by a person living in the same household as the pet(s)

151

prior to scheduling of the sampling visit. Surveys could be completed by the study participant

152

online using the REDCap interface, or on the phone with the study coordinator if preferred.

153

Human items included symptoms, timeline, and severity of COVID-19 infection and illness for

154

any affected household members (including individuals who did not have confirmatory testing),

155

and comorbidities. Animal items were stratified on individual animal, and included veterinary

156

clinical variables, history of COVID-like illness, and contact between individual animals and

157

individual members of the household including questions pertaining to co-sleeping, kissing, and

158

sharing of glassware and other food containers (“utensils”). Environmental items included type

159

and size of home, type of flooring (carpet, wood, etc.), and availability of outdoor space for pets

160

to roam.

161

A second brief survey was completed verbally at the time of sampling to collect data on

162

changes in the clinical status of human and animal household members since the REDCap

163

survey was completed, including new hospitalizations, symptoms, or COVID-19 diagnoses.

164

Confirmation of COVID-19 positive status and testing date was also performed at this time

165

through review of test results by the sampling team.

166

Animal sampling

167

Sampling was performed by a team of two study personnel, one veterinarian and either a

168

second veterinarian or an assistant trained in ethical animal restraint. In most cases sampling

169

was conducted at the participant’s home, however several animals were tested at veterinary

170

clinics. No chemical restraint was used, nor muzzles due to biosafety concerns. When possible,

171

sampling was performed outdoors to minimize the study team’s exposure, however the same

172

PPE and health and safety protocols were adhered to regardless of whether sampling was

173

indoors or outdoors.

174

Species-appropriate restraint was employed using standard techniques to allow for

175

venipuncture and collection of 3 mL of blood into a labeled serum separator tube. Following

176

venipuncture, swab samples were collected from both rostral nares/nasal passage and the

177

caudal oropharynx, and placed into one Primestore MTM tube [Longhorn Vaccines and

178

Diagnostics]. If an animal started to exhibit severe signs of stress and/or aggression during

179

restraint, attempts to sample were halted to maintain human and animal safety. All participants

180

received educational information about measures to mitigate household COVID-19

181

transmission from the field team.

182

Swab and serum samples were transported on ice within 24 hours to the Washington

183

Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (WADDL) for PCR and antibody testing.

SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein ELISA

203

For dog antibody testing, WADDL developed a SARS-CoV-2 ELISA assay using recombinant SARS-

204

CoV-2 Spike Receptor Binding Domain protein as antigen (S-RBD). The recombinant RBD was

205

obtained from the UW Center for Emerging and Reemerging Infectious Disease (CERID)

206

laboratory of Dr. Wesley Van Voorhis through an institutional Material Transfer Agreement.

well format based up a previous publication in humans. The major components of the assay

209

included: 1) rS-RBD coating of plates as target antigen (2ug/ml in Sigma Carbonate-Bicarbonate

210

Buffer); 2) 1:100 dilution of test sera (diluted in ChronBlock ELISA Buffer-Chondrex Inc.); 3) anti

211

dog IgG-HRP as linker (Southern BioTech goat anti-canine IgG) and 4) Sigma (TMB) liquid

212

substrate system to develop OD. Plates were blocked with ChronBlock ELISA buffer per

213

manufacturer’s instructions, washing solution consisted of PBS+0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma), and

214

plates were read on a plate reader at 450 nM. Test samples and controls were run in triplicate.

215

The negative controls consisted of sera from six pre-COVID dogs, archived at WADDL, run in

216

triplicate and the mean utilized as “OD negative controls”. The positive cutoff of 2.0 test

217

OD:negative control OD equated to mean of negative controls + 3 standard deviations of the

218

mean.

219

Statistical analyses

220

A study database was created using an anonymous identifier to store epidemiological and

221

clinical data through REDCap. All analyses were conducted in R [13].

222

The primary aim of this study was to estimate the burden of household SARS-CoV-2

223

transmission from humans to their pets. Secondary aims included describing the nature of

224

human-animal contact within households, and identifying risk factors for household

225

transmission, including human-animal contact.

226

Outcome

227

Animal infection with SARS-CoV-2 was defined as an animal meeting one or more of the

228

following criteria: (1) seropositive status, (2) PCR positive status, or (3) COVID-19 like illness,

229

defined as participant answer of “yes” to the survey question: “Since the time of COVID

diagnosis/symptom onset in the household, has this animal had any new issues with difficulty

231

breathing, coughing and/or decreased interest in playing, walking, or eating?”

232

Descriptive statistics

233

All descriptive statistics were generated at the animal-level. Key variables included human-

234

animal transmission, animal and human clinical variables, environmental variables, and human-

235

animal contact variables. If there was more than one SARS-CoV-2 positive household member,

236

the index case was defined as the person completing the survey.

237

Regression models

238

Outcomes

239

Outcome was defined as an animal case of SARS-CoV-2, defined above. Separate regression

240

models were fit for each outcome definition.

241

Exposures

242

Household-level exposures for animal infection included residence in house versus apartment

243

or condominium (binary), home size in square feet (continuous), and the number of confirmed

244

SARS-CoV-2 cases (continuous).

245

Animal-level exposures for infection included bedsharing with one or more human

246

household members (binary), sharing eating utensils with humans (binary), and SARS-CoV-2

247

positive household members taking precautions to prevent transmission to their pets following

248

diagnosis, including not petting or kissing the animal, staying in a different room, and having

249

someone else feed and walk the animal (binary).

250
251

We also examined the association between canine seropositivity and COVID-19 like
illness in the animal, and between seropositivity and time since the animal was first exposed,

252

defined as 2 days prior to the first date any household member had symptoms of COVID-19 or

253

tested positive, whichever was earlier.

254

Confounders

255

We identified possible confounders a priori using a directed acyclic graph (DAG; Figure 1). The

256

minimum sufficient adjustment set was defined, using this DAG and DAGitty.net, separately for

257

each exposure [14].

258

For house type, the minimum sufficient set was {SES}; for indoor-only status, the

259

minimum sufficient set was {number of positive household members, house size, house type,

260

precautions taken, bedsharing, and sharing eating utensils}; for house size, the minimum

261

sufficient set was {SES, house type}; for sharing eating utensils, the minimum sufficient set was

262

{number of positive household members, house type, house size, indoor-only status,

263

precautions taken, and bedsharing}; for number of positive household members, the minimum

264

sufficient set was {SES, house size}; for bedsharing, the minimum sufficient set was {number of

265

positive household members, house size, house type, indoor-only status, precautions taken,

266

and sharing eating utensils}; and for precautions taken, the minimum sufficient set was

267

{number of positive household members, house size, house type, indoor-only status,

268

bedsharing, and sharing eating utensils}.

Models
For each exposure of interest we implemented a generalized estimating equation (GEE)

279

approach with an exchangeable working correlation structure, household as the clustering

280

variable, and binomial models with a logit link, using the geepack package in R [15]. For

281

regression of serostatus on COVID-19 like illness and time since first exposure, we performed

282

logistic regression using the glm() function in R.

RESULTS

285

Recruitment

286

Out of 70 households enrolled to date, 54 had completed the REDCap survey. Out of these 54

287

households, 35 were in King County, 6 in Whitman County, 2 in Pierce County, 1 in Spokane

288

County, 1 in Benton County (all Washington), 8 in Latah County, Idaho, and one unknown (no

289

sample visit conducted). There were four households in which the index case’s date of diagnosis

290

was not confirmed by the study team during sampling. No unhoused households have been

291

recruited to date. After subsetting to households containing dogs, 67 dogs from 46 households

292

were available for analyses. The data for cats are undergoing a separate analysis, and no ferrets

293

or hamsters have been enrolled or sampled.

294

immediately after the onset of the participant’s COVID-19 symptoms. That family member

297

subsequently tested positive, thus the dog and corresponding households were removed from

298

analyses as it was difficult to determine which household should be assigned to this dog for

299

analysis. This dog was seropositive.

300

Sample collection is detailed in Figure 3. Out of 67 dogs corresponding to households

301

with completed surveys, two belong to one household which had not yet been sampled, and a

302

third belongs to a household which was unable to be sampled. Six dogs belonged to households

303

in which other animals were sampled but these dogs were judged unsafe to be sampled for PCR

304

or serology, while an additional seven dogs were judged safe to restrain for swab samples but

305

not for serum collection.

PCR results were available for 58 dogs and serology results were available for 51 dogs. Of these,

318

22 (43.1%, 95% CI 0.30, 0.57) of dogs were seropositive and 14 (23.7%, 95% CI 0.13, 0.35) had

319

COVID-19 like illness reported. All dogs in the study were SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative from

320

nasopharyngeal swab samples. There were 6 households with more than one seropositive dog:

321

5 households with two dogs each who were both seropositive, and 1 household with 5 dogs,

322

two of whom were seropositive.

323

Nearly one-third of dogs engaged in activities outside of the household during periods of

324

isolation or quarantine, 42 (63%) resided in households whose residents reported awareness of

325

CDC guidelines to prevent human-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and 33 (51%) resided in

326

households which reported taking precautions to prevent such transmission to household

327

pet(s) following diagnosis. With regards to human COVID-19 illness in household residents, only

328

one dog resided in a household in which the case was hospitalized, however 28% resided in

329

households in which the case had pre-existing conditions. Nearly all dogs had access to yards or

330

gardens (85%) and were allowed on furniture (89%), and the majority were kissed by (69%) and

331

shared beds with (72%) human household members. Almost all dogs’ eating utensils were

332

washed in the kitchen (95%).

Regression models

344

Results of regression models are presented in Table 2 as prevalence odds ratios, reflecting the

345

cross-sectional design of this study. With the exception of house size, which was adjusted for

346

house type as the minimum sufficient adjustment set was very small for this exposure,

347

confounders were not adjusted for due to concerns regarding overfitting arising from the small

348

sample size. Effect modification, e.g. by animal age or sex, was not explored for the same

349

reason.

350

No effect estimates reached statistical significance, however there were positive trends

351

across both outcome definitions for bed sharing with humans and the number of SARS-CoV-2

352

positive humans in the corresponding households, and a negative effect for precautions taken

353

to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission following diagnosis. We also found serostatus was

354

associated with COVID-19 like illness.

DISCUSSION

366

We present the results of a cross-sectional, One Health study of dogs and humans sharing

367

households where at least one human was infected with SARS-CoV-2. The study results indicate

368

that household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to animals occurs frequently, and

369

that these animals commonly display signs of COVID-19 like illness. Notably, in the vast majority

370

of cases with multiple dogs in a household, all the dogs shared the same serostatus. We

371

furthermore show that close human-animal contact is common among people and their pets in

372

this study population, that this contact appears to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and that

373

pet owners in this population are familiar with and willing to adopt measures to protect their

374

pets from COVID-19.

375

There are several limitations to our approach. First, several weeks had elapsed from first

376

reported exposure to household sample collection from animals in most households, limiting

377

our ability to detect viral shedding by PCR testing if nasal shedding is short-lived, but perhaps

378

strengthening our ability to detect seroconversion. Second, we report here on the findings of

379

the cross-sectional (baseline) component of our study. Were any pets to test PCR positive, a

380

longitudinal component would follow. As the outcomes are common, our prevalence odds

381

ratios do not approximate prevalence ratios. Third, our study is subject to residual confounding

382

due to inability to adjust for confounders without risking over-fitting, with the exception of

17

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.24.440952; this version posted April 26, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

383

house size, which was adjusted for house type. While we believe the confounders examined,

384

most of which are also exposures of interest, are likely strong risk factors for the outcome, they

385

are only strong confounders if they also have strong relationships with the exposure of interest.

386

We do not expect this association to be strong for confounders that do not represent latent

387

(and therefore difficult to measure and model) constructs, such as socioeconomic status,

388

strength of the human-animal bond, and level of concern about zoonotic disease transmission.

389

With the exception of PCR testing, mentioned above, we do not expect strong

390

measurement error in any of the variables examined. As no gold-standard for canine anti-SARS-

391

CoV-2 serology exists we could not estimate sensitivity of our serological test, however all pre-

392

COVID-19 samples evaluated were negative, indicating specificity approaches 100%. While our

393

primary aim—to estimate the burden of human-animal SARS-CoV-2 transmission—was

394

estimated with reasonable precision, as we were not able to estimate sensitivity of our

395

serological test, we could not propagate uncertainty arising from imperfect sensitivity in our

396

prevalence estimates. Furthermore, due to our small sample size variance was high for our

397

estimated prevalence odds ratios. Finally, by nature of our recruitment methods and study

398

population, generalizability of our findings is likely limited to highly-educated, higher-income

399

individuals residing in urban and suburban communities.

400
401

CONCLUSIONS

402

These limitations aside, our study contributes important and novel findings to the literature on

403

cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2, with relevance to other zoonoses and

404

anthropozoonoses transmitted in a household setting. Furthermore, we collected human,

405

animal, and environmental data, representing a true One Health approach to this critical

406

research question. Finally, our findings indicate households in this population are willing to

407

adopt measures to protect their pets from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that these measures may

408

be effective, indicating an opportunity to prevent household transmission of zoonoses and

409

anthropozoonoses through health education and policy. As vaccine roll-out continues and

410

human-to-human transmission wanes, and in preparation for the next pandemic of zoonotic

411

origin, rigorous characterization of the nature of human-animal contact within households, and

412

the implications of this contact for disease transmission, is critical.
