Discovery of simeprevir as a potent suppressor of SARS-CoV-2 viral replication
that synergizes with remdesivir.
Abstract
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global threat to human
health. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we identified and validated the hepatitis C
virus (HCV) protease inhibitor simeprevir as an especially promising repurposable drug
for treating COVID-19. Simeprevir potently reduces SARS-CoV-2 viral load by multiple
orders of magnitude and synergizes with remdesivir in vitro. Mechanistically, we showed
that simeprevir inhibits the main protease (Mpro) and unexpectedly the RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRp). Our results thus reveal the viral protein targets of simeprevir,
and provide preclinical rationale for the combination of simeprevir and remdesivir for the
pharmacological management of COVID-19 patients.

Introduction
The recent outbreak of infection by the novel betacoronavirus severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread to almost all countries
and claimed more than 760,000 lives worldwide (WHO situation report 209, August 16,
2020). Alarming features of COVID-19 include a high risk of clustered outbreak both in
community and nosocomial settings, and up to one-fifth severe/critically ill proportion of
symptomatic inpatients reported1–4. Furthermore, a significant proportion of infected
individuals are asymptomatic, substantially delaying their diagnoses, hence facilitating
the widespread dissemination of COVID-195. With a dire need for effective therapeutics
that can reduce both clinical severity and viral shedding, numerous antiviral candidates

have been under clinical trials or in compassionate use for the treatment of SARS-CoV2 infection6.
Several antivirals under study are hypothesized or proven to target the key
mediator of a specific step in the SARS-CoV-2 viral replication cycle. For instance,
lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and danoprevir have been proposed to inhibit the SARS-CoV2 main protease (Mpro, also called 3CLPro) needed for the maturation of multiple viral
proteins; chloroquine (CQ) / hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) [alone or combined with
azithromycin (AZ)] may abrogate viral replication by inhibiting endosomal acidification
crucial for viral entry7,8; nucleoside analogues such as remdesivir, ribavirin, favipiravir
and EIDD-2801 likely inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp) and/or induce lethal mutations during viral RNA replication9–11. Unfortunately, on
the clinical aspect, LPV/r failed to demonstrate clinical benefits in well-powered
randomized controlled trials (RCTs), while HCQ and/or AZ also failed to demonstrate
benefits in observational studies12–14. Meanwhile, LPV/r, CQ/HCQ and AZ may even
increase the incidence of adverse events14–16. Although remdesivir is widely considered
as one of the most promising candidates, latest RCTs only revealed marginal
shortening of disease duration in patients treated17. Therefore, further efforts are
required to search for more potent, readily repurposable therapeutic agents for SARSCoV-2 infection, either as sole therapy or in combination with other drugs to enhance
their efficacy.
Ideally, the candidate drugs need to be readily available as intravenous and/or
oral formulation(s), possess favourable pharmacokinetics properties as anti-infectives,
and do not cause adverse events during the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g.
non-specific immunosuppression, arrhythmia or respiratory side effects). Two
complementary approaches have been adopted to identify novel drugs or compounds
that can suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication. One approach relies on in vitro profiling of
the antiviral efficacy of up to thousands of compounds in early clinical development, or
drugs already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)18–22. On the
other hand, as the crystal structure of the Mpro 23,24, papain-like protease (PLpro)25 and
the cryo-EM structure of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 RdRp complex11,26 of the SARS-CoV-2
virus became available, the structure-based development of their specific inhibitors
becomes feasible. Structure-aided screening will enable the discovery of novel
compounds as highly potent inhibitors27 as well as the repurposing of readily available
drugs as anti-CoV agents for fast-track clinical trials.
Here we report our results regarding the discovery of FDA-approved drugs
potentially active against the SARS-CoV-2. In vitro experiments led to the identification
of simeprevir, a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3A/4 protease inhibitor28, as a potent inhibitor
of SARS-CoV-2 replication (Fig. 1A). Importantly, simeprevir acts synergistically with
remdesivir, whereby the effective dose of remdesivir could be lowered by multiple-fold

by simeprevir at physiologically feasible concentrations. Interestingly, biochemical and
molecular characterizations revealed that simeprevir inhibits both the Mpro protease and
RdRp polymerase activities. This unexpected anti-SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of
simeprevir provides hints on novel antiviral strategies.
Results
A prioritized screening identifies simeprevir as a potent suppressor of SARS-CoV-2
replication in a cellular infection model
Given our goal of identifying immediately usable and practical drugs against
SARS-CoV-2, we prioritized a list of repurposing drug candidates for in vitro testing
based on joint considerations on safety, pharmacokinetics, drug formulation availability,
and feasibility of rapidly conducting clinical trials (Table S1). We focused on FDAapproved antivirals (including simeprevir, saquinavir, daclatasvir, ribavirin, sofosbuvir
and zidovudine), and drugs whose primary indication was not antiviral but had reported
antiviral activity (including bromocriptine and atovaquone). Remdesivir was also tested
for comparison of efficacy and as a positive control.
In a Vero E6 cellular infection model, we found the macrocyclic HCV protease

(Fig. 1B). More detailed

dose-response characterization found that simeprevir has a potency comparable to
remdesivir (Fig. 1C, D). The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of simeprevir
was determined to be 4.08 μM, while the 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) was
19.33 μM (Fig. 1C, D). In a physiologically relevant human lung epithelial cell model,
ACE2-expressing A549 cells (A549-ACE2) infected with SARS-CoV-2, we also
observed the strong antiviral effect of simeprevir29 (Supplementary Fig. 1). The
cytotoxicity data are also in line with the reported in vitro and in vivo safety
pharmacological profiling using human cell lines, genotoxicity assays, and animal
models28,30. These data suggest that a desirable therapeutic window exists for the
suppression of SARS-CoV-2 replication with simeprevir.

RNA Sequencing identifies significant downregulation of viral defense responses upon
the treatment of simeprevir
While inhibition of viral targets seems to be a primary mechanism of action of
simeprevir, the weak inhibitory effects observed in biochemical assays as well as its
cytotoxicity suggest the possibility of additional host-mediated antiviral response. To
further elucidate the antiviral mechanism of simeprevir, we next performed RNA
sequencing on Vero E6 cells to reveal the transcriptomic changes upon drug treatment
(Fig. 4A). In line with the literature, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced type I interferon and
chemokine response (Supplementary Fig. 9)35,36. In mock-infected cells, simeprevir
treatment (at 1.1 μM or 3.3 μM) did not induce any significant changes of differentially
expressed genes (DEGs); while in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, a small number of DEGs
was observed (Fig. 4B). Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of infected cells using
Reactome gene sets revealed significant positive enrichment of 93 gene sets in the
simeprevir-treated samples, including histone lysine/arginine methylation, histone
demethylation, and cell cycle control (Fig. 4C, Supplementary table 2). On the other
hand, gene sets with the gene ontology (GO) terms “defense response to virus” and
“response to type I interferon” were negatively enriched, suggesting overall
downregulation of these gene sets (Fig. 4D). In the latter set, green monkey orthologs
of crucial human innate immune-related genes (e.g. IFIT1-3, USP18) and interferonstimulated genes (e.g. ISG15) were downregulated with simeprevir treatment in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 4E). Similarly, the downregulation of some of these genes as
well as the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and interferon IFNL1 were also observed
with remdesivir treatment (Fig. 4F).

Discussion
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has gone from an emerging infection to a
global pandemic with its high transmissibility. As human activities are becoming more
re
aggressive and damaging to nature, future coronavirus pandemics are bound to
happen. It is therefore essential to reduce the casualties by effective pharmacological

management. Our study has successfully identified the readily repurposable, clinically
practical antiviral simeprevir that could target SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, we found up to
fourth-order suppression of viral genome copies by

simeprevir at ≤ 10 μM in cell-based

s - a concentration that is expected to be attainable in human lung

tissues with ≥ 150mg daily dosing based on available pharmacokinetic data37,38.
In addition, we discovered that simeprevir can synergize with remdesivir in
inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in a cellular model, potentially allowing lower doses of
both drugs to be used to treat COVID-19. In a global pandemic with patients having
diverse clinical characteristics, providing additional therapeutic options to remdesivir will
be important to treat those who are intolerant or not responding to the drug 17, which
can easily amount to tens of thousands of patients. As there is only one confirmed and
approved therapy for COVID-19, a potentially repurposable drug can be rapidly tested in
animal models before clinical trials to prepare for supply shortages or when remdesivirresistant mutations arise. Combination treatment, such as simeprevir-remdesivir, may
also help to reduce the dose required to alleviate side effects.
We note, however, there are also several limitations of simeprevir and the
proposed simeprevir-remdesivir combination. Simeprevir requires dose adjustments in
patients with Child-Pugh Class B or C cirrhosis, as well as in patients with East Asian
ancestry37. In addition, simeprevir has been taken off the market since 2018 due to the
emergence of next-generation HCV protease inhibitors, hence its supply may not be
ramped up easily. Noteworthily, simeprevir is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme with
saturable kinetics37 while remdesivir itself is not only a substrate of CYP3A4 but also a
CYP3A4 inhibitor. Whether such theoretical pharmacokinetic interaction will exacerbate
liver toxicity or provide additional pharmacokinetic synergy (in addition to
pharmacodynamic synergy) in vivo remains to be tested.
Mechanistically, we found that simeprevir suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication by
targeting at least two viral proteins – it weakly inhibits Mpro at ~10 μM and unexpectedly
inhibits RdRp at ~5 μM. The potency towards Mpro is consistent with the IC50 of ~13.7
μM as determined in a parallel study39. Our gel-based assay (Supplementary Fig. 9)
suggested that simeprevir interferes with RNA-binding of RdRp because less probe was
extended but to full length. This is also supported by the in silico docking results, in
which simeprevir is docked to a highly conserved RNA binding site showing no amino
acid polymorphism between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. 8A).
This putative binding mode hints that simeprevir might block the RNA binding site while
remdesivir might target the nucleoside entry site, potentially resulting in a synergistic
effect. Importantly, the high similarity in sequence (96% identity) and structure between
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV also suggest that simeprevir might act as a broadspectrum antiviral in the Coronaviridae family.

Furthermore, the discrepancy between RdRp and Mpro inhibitory potency versus
in vitro inhibitory potency of SARS-CoV-2 replication suggested additional
mechanism(s) of action of simeprevir. Our RNA-seq and GSEA analysis revealed
several molecular pathways that warrant future investigation. A possible direction is
immune modulation via epigenetic regulations, which could mediate viral infection (via
SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and histone H3.3 complex)40, interferoninduced antiviral response (via H3K79 methylation)41, and host immune evasion (via
alteration of DNA methylome)42. Whether the downregulation of type I IFN-related
genes stems directly from simeprevir’s action or a reduction in viral load remains an
open question. Collectively, simeprevir targets two viral proteins but may also act on the
host proteins to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication.
Given that simeprevir is originally a non-nucleoside antiviral targeting HCV
protease, its inhibition towards RdRp is largely unexpected and represents a novel
mechanism of action. Simeprevir thus holds promise to be a lead compound for the
future development of dual inhibitors of Mpro and RdRp. It should be noted that the
potencies of Mpro and RdRp inhibition may not entirely account for the strong
suppression of SARS-CoV-2 viral replication. Therefore, further investigation of the
mechanism of action of simeprevir may uncover new druggable targets for inhibiting
SARS-CoV-2 replication.

quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) at 48 h post-infection with specific primers
targeting the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1b43.
In vitro drug cytotoxicity assays
In vitro cytotoxicity of the tested drugs was evaluated using thiazolyl blue
tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich)-based cell viability assays. Vero E6 cells
were seeded onto 48-well plates and treated with indicated concentrations of simeprevir
and/or remdesivir for 48 h. Treated cells were incubated with DMEM supplemented with
0.15 mg/mL MTT for 2 h, and formazan crystal products were dissolved with DMSO.
Cell viability was quantified with colorimetric absorbance at 590 nm.
Molecular docking simulations
Three-dimensional representations of chemical structures were extracted from
the ZINC15 database (http://zinc15.docking.org)44, with the application of three selection
filters –– Protomers, Anodyne, and Ref. ZINC15 subset DrugBank FDA
(http://zinc15.docking.org./catalogs/dbfda/) were downloaded as the mol2 file format.
The molecular structures were then converted to the pdbqt format (the input file format
for AutoDock Vina) using MGLTools2-1.1 RC1 (sub-program “prepare_ligand”)
(http://adfr.scripps.edu/versions/1.1/downloads.html). AutoDock Vina v1.1.2 was
employed to perform docking experiments45. Docking of simeprevir on SARS-CoV-2
Mpro was performed with the target structure based on an apo protein crystal structure
(PDB ID: 6YB7); the A:B dimer was generated by crystallographic symmetry. Docking
was run with the substrate-binding residues set to be flexible. Docking of simeprevir and
other active triphosphate forms of nucleotide analogues was performed against the
nsp12 portion of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex cryo-EM structure (PDB
ID: 6M71).
Expression and purification of Mpro and its substrate for FRET assay
The sequence of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was obtained from GenBank (accession
number: YP_009725301), codon-optimized, and ordered from GenScript. A C-terminal
hexahistidine-maltose binding protein (His6-MBP) tag with two in-between Factor Xa
digestion sites were inserted. Expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was then
performed as described for SARS-CoV Mpro 31. The protein substrate, where the
cleavage sequence “TSAVLQSGFRKM” of Mpro was inserted between a cyan
fluorescent protein and a yellow fluorescent protein, was expressed and purified as

The inhibition assay was based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer
(FRET) using a fluorescent protein-based substrate previously developed for SARSCoV Mpro 31,46. 0.1 μM of purified SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was pre-incubated with 0 - 250 μM
simeprevir in 20 mM HEPES pH 6.5, 120 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, 4 mM DTT for 30
min before the reaction was initiated by addition of 10 μM protein substrate32. Protease
activity was followed at 25 °C by FRET with excitation and emission wavelengths of 430
nm and 530 nm, respectively, using a multi-plate reader as previously described31,46.
Reduction of fluorescence at 530 nm was fitted to a single exponential decay to obtain
the observed rate constant (kobs). Relative activity of Mpro was defined as the ratio of kobs
with inhibitors to that without. The relative IC50 value of simeprevir was determined by
fitting the relative activity at different inhibitor concentration to a four-parameter logistics
equation.
Expression and purification of SARS-CoV nsp7L8, nsp12
The fusion protein nsp7-nsp8 (nsp7L8) was generated by inserting a GSGSGS
linker sequence between the nsp7 and nsp8 coding sequences34 . The nsp7L8, nsp8
and nsp12 were produced and purified independently as described47. The complex,
referred to as the replication/transcription complex (RTC), was reconstituted with a 1:3:3
ratio of nsp12:nsp7L8:nsp8.
In vitro RdRp inhibition assay - fluorescence-based
The assay was performed as previously described48. The compound
concentration leading to a 50% inhibition of RTC-mediated RNA synthesis was
determined as previously described. Briefly, poly(A) template and the SARS-CoV RTC
was incubated 5 min at room temperature and then added to increasing concentration
of compound. Reaction was started by adding UTP and incubated 20 min at 30°C.
Reaction assays were stopped by the addition of 20 µl EDTA 100 mM. Positive and
negative controls consisted of a reaction mix with 5% DMSO (final concentration) or
EDTA (100 mM) instead of compounds, respectively. Picogreen® fluorescent reagent
was diluted to 1/800 final in TE buffer according to the data manufacturer and aliquots
were distributed into each well of the plate. The plate was incubated for 5 min in the
dark at room temperature and the fluorescence signal was then read at 480 nm
(excitation) and 530 nm (emission) using a TecanSafire2 microplate reader. IC50 was
determined using the following equation: % of active enzyme = 100/(1+(I)2/IC50), where I
is the concentration of inhibitor and 100% of activity is the fluorescence intensity without
inhibitor. IC50 was determined from curve-fitting using the GraphPad Prism 8.
In vitro RdRp inhibition assay - gel-based
Enzyme mix (10 µM nsp12, 30 µM nsp7L8, 30 µM nsp8) in complex buffer (25
mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 NaCl, 5 mM TCEP, 5 mM MgCl2) was incubated for 10 min on

ice and then diluted with reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM
MgCl2) to 2 µM nsp12 (6 µM nsp7L8 and nsp8) to a final volume of 10 µl. The resulting
enzyme complex was mixed with the 10 µl of 0.8 µM primer/ template (P/T) carrying a
Cy5 fluorescent label at the 5’ end (P:Cy5-GUC AUU CUC C, T: UAG CUU CUU AGG
AGA AUG AC) in reaction buffer, and incubated at 30°C for 10 min. Inhibitor was added
in 2 µl to the elongation complex and reactions were immediately started with 18 µl of
NTP mix in the reaction buffer. Final concentrations in the reactions were 0.5 µM nsp12
(1.5 µM nsp7L8 and nsp8), 0.2 µM P/T, 50 µM NTPs and the given concentrations of
inhibitors. Samples of 8 µl were taken at given time points and mixed with 40 µl of
formamide containing 10 mM EDTA. Ten-µl samples were analyzed by denaturing
PAGE (20 % acrylamide, 7 M urea, TBE buffer); and product profiles visualized by a
fluorescence imager (Amersham Typhoon). Quantification of product bands and
analysis were performed using ImageQuant and Excel.
In vitro PLpro inhibition assay - fluorescence-based
The purification and assay of PLpro activity was adapted from as previously
described25. Briefly, a ISG15-C-term protein tagged with rhodamine was used as a
substrate for the enzymatic assay. Because of the solubility of Simeprevir, we used an
optimized reaction buffer (5% DMSO, 15% PEG300, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM
NaCl, 5 mM DTT). 5 uL of solution containing 0 - 2 mM of Simeprevir and 2 µM of
ISG15c-rhodamine were aliquoted into a 384-well plate. Reaction was initiated by
addition of 5 µL of 40 nM PLpro to the well. Initial velocities of rhodamine release (36 240 seconds) were normalized against DMSO control. Reactions were conducted for 12
minutes with monitoring of fluorescence intensity at 485/520 nm using a microplate
reader (PHERAstar FSX, BMG Labtech). The same experiment was repeated with
ubiquitin-rhodamine substrate.
In vitro PLpro inhibition assay - Gel-based
All proteins used for ubiquitination and PLpro biochemical assays were expressed
in E. coli RIL cells with 0.6 mM IPTG over-induction at 16 ˚C. Rsp5 WW3-HECT with 2
mutations (Q808M, E809L) at the C-terminus was expressed using GST-fusion affinity
tag followed by TEV protease digestion and purification by size exclusion
chromatography. His-tagged PLpro, UBA1, UBCH7, ubiquitin K63R with extra cysteine at
the N-terminus were also expressed and purified similarly, except hexahistidine tag
used. Ubiquitin was further cross-linked with fluorescein-5-maleimide (Anaspec,
Fremont, CA, US) and the poly-ubiquitination sample was generated following previous
protocol 49. Deubiquitination assays using PLpro (SARS-CoV-2) were carried out at 37
˚C for 10 minutes using 1-100 µM Simeprevir and 1 µM PLpro. Final DMSO
concentration of each reaction is 2%. The reaction was quenched by SDS sample buffer
and analyzed by 4-20% SDS-gel (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, US). Fluorescent ubiquitin
signals were imaged using Thermo iBright exposed for 750 ms.

Sample preparation for RNA-seq
Approximately 4 x 105 Vero E6 cells were seeded onto each well of 12-well
plates, in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM L glutamine, 25
mM HEPES and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Infections of SARS-CoV-2 were performed
at a MOI of 1 for 24 hours, followed by drug treatment or 2% DMSO in triplicates.
Uninfected cells were also treated with the same concentrations of drug or DMSO in
triplicates. After 24 hours of drug treatment, total RNA from infected cells and uninfected
cells were extracted using Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Then, we performed pair-end sequencing on a NovaSeq
6000 PE150 platform and generated 20 million reads per sample at Novogene
Bioinformatics Institute (Novogene, Beijing, China).
Bioinformatic Analyses
The raw reads quality was checked by the FastQC (0.11.7) and aligned to ChlSab1.1
(Chlorocebus sabaeus) reference genome by the STAR (2.5.0a) with default
parameters. The count matrix was generated by the featureCounts (as a component of
Subread package 2.0.1) program. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were
calculated by DESeq2 package (1.26.0) under R environment (3.6.1) and characterized
for each sample (|L2FC| > 1, p-adjusted-value < 0.05). Gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA) was performed as previously described using normalized counts with orthology
gene converting to human gene by biomaRt package (2.42.1)50. Bubble plots and
heatmaps were generated using ggplot package and heatmap() function in R
respectively.
Statistical Analyses
For in vitro experiments, four-parameter dose response curve fitting was performed with
constraints: Top = 1, IC50 > 0 using GraphPad Prism 8.

Supplementary Fig. 3 (A) The addition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro led to the cleavage of the substrate, causing
ng
detectable decline in FRET signal with 430-nm excitation and 530-nm emission. (B) Confirmation of
substrate cleavage by Mpro using SDS-PAGE. (C) The addition of simeprevir at varying concentrations
pro
attenuated the rate of FRET substrate cleavage by M .

Supplementary Fig. 4 Docking of simeprevir on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (performed with AutoDock Vina
na
version 1.1.2). The Mpro structure was based on an apo protein crystal structure (PDB ID: 6YB7); the A:B
:B
dimer was generated by crystallographic symmetry. Docking was run with the substrate-binding residues
es
set to be flexible; and a 30 x 30 x 30 Å3 search box centered near the side-chain Nε2 atom of His163. The
he
-1
top docking mode shown here scored -9.9 kcal mol . The protein is shown as a semi-transparent
nt
molecular surface encasing its stick model with the catalytic residues His41 and Cys145 in green. The
he
ligand is shown as a stick model with oxygen atoms in red; nitrogen atoms in blue, sulfur atoms in yellow
w
and carbon atoms in white.

Supplementary Fig. 6 Inhibitor deubiquitination assay of PLpro shows PLpro (SARS-CoV-2) actively
ly
cleaves poly-ubiquitinated substrate into di-ubiquitin or longer ubiquitin chain. While simeprevir was
as
added in reaction solution, the activity of PLpro was not profoundly inhibited compared to control
rol
experiments (no inhibitor and no inhibitor with 2% DMSO).
