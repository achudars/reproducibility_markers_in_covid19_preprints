ABSTRACT
This paper presents the design and study of a first-in-class cyclic peptide inhibitor against
the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). The cyclic peptide inhibitor is designed to mimic the
conformation of a substrate at a C-terminal autolytic cleavage site of Mpro. Synthesis and
evaluation of a first-generation cyclic peptide inhibitor reveals that the inhibitor is active against
Mpro in vitro and is non-toxic toward human cells in culture. The initial hit described in this
manuscript, UCI-1, lays the groundwork for the development of additional cyclic peptide
inhibitors against Mpro with improved activities.

INTRODUCTION
Antiviral drugs are desperately needed to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic caused
by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as epidemics
caused by other coronaviruses in the future.1,2 Antiviral drugs that slow or halt viral replication
can lead to a shortened time to recovery from COVID-19, offering the promise of improved
mortality rates and alleviation of the tremendous strain experienced by hospitals during the
COVID-19 pandemic.3
The main protease (Mpro or 3CL protease) is one of the best-characterized drug targets for
coronaviruses.4,5,6,7,8,9,10 The SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a member of a of class homologous
cysteine proteases that are needed for viral replication in diseases such as Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). These viruses
cleave the initially translated viral polyprotein into its component proteins. Cleavage generally
occurs immediately after a Gln residue, and the Gln residue is typically preceded by a
hydrophobic residue, most often Leu. The residue that follows the Gln is often a small amino
acid such as Ser, Ala, or Asn. Mpro autolytically cleaves itself from the polyprotein.11 Inhibiting
Mpro activity slows or halts viral replication, offering the promise of improved clinical outcomes
for COVID-19 and other coronavirus diseases. Furthermore, there are no known human
proteases with similar cleavage specificity to Mpro, suggesting that it should be possible to
develop inhibitors that target Mpro without off-target toxicity.
The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro amino acid sequence is 96% identical to the SARS-CoV Mpro
amino sequence, and the three-dimensional structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is highly similar
to the structure of the SARS-CoV Mpro.12 Peptide-based inhibitors previously developed to target
the SARS-CoV Mpro have effectively been repurposed and modified to target the SARS-CoV-2

Mpro — N3 from Jin et al., 13b from Zhang et al., and 11a and 11b from Dai et al.12,13,14 These
inhibitors effectively block SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell-based studies, making them
promising antiviral drug candidates. While the Mpro inhibitors N3, 13b, 11a, and 11b have shown
promise against inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication, additional Mpro inhibitors will most likely
be needed for their improved properties or to be used in combination therapies.15
In this paper, we describe the design and preliminary evaluation of UCI-1 (University of
California, Irvine Coronavirus Inhibitor-1), a first-in-class cyclic peptide that inhibits the SARSCoV-2 Mpro (Figure 1). UCI-1 is designed to mimic the conformation of a C-terminal autolytic
cleavage site of the SARS-CoV Mpro, a naturally occurring Mpro substrate. UCI-1 contains amino
acid side chains from the P2, P1, P1’, and P2’ positions of the Mpro substrate that are designed to
fill the S2, S1, S1’, and S2’ pockets of the Mpro active site (Figure 1A). In UCI-1, the carboxyterminus of the P2’ residue is linked to the amino-terminus of the P2 residue with a [4-(2aminoethyl)phenyl]-acetic acid (AEPA) group, creating a cyclophane. The (2-aminoethyl)phenyl
group of AEPA is designed to act as a surrogate for a phenylalanine side chain at position P3’
and fill the S3’ pocket. Evaluation of the first generation cyclic peptide inhibitor UCI-1 in an in
vitro Mpro inhibition assay reveals that UCI-1 is active against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro at midmicromolar concentrations. LC/MS analysis indicates that UCI-1 resists cleavage by Mpro,
despite containing a scissile amide bond. Furthermore, UCI-1 is found to be non-toxic toward
human embryonic kidney cells at concentrations that inhibit Mpro. The following details the
design, synthesis, and preliminary evaluation of UCI-1.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Design of the cyclic peptide inhibitor. We designed the cyclic peptide inhibitor based on
the crystal structure of an inactive SARS-CoV Mpro (C145A) variant with a 10 amino-acid Cterminal extension corresponding to the C-terminal prosequence of Mpro (PDB 5B6O) (Figure
2).16 We term this Mpro variant “Mpro316”. In the Mpro316 crystal structure, C-terminal residues
301–310 (SGVTFQGKFK) extend into and complex with the active site of another Mpro316
molecule in an adjacent asymmetric unit (Figure 2 inset). This complex reveals how the P2-P1-

The cyclic peptide inhibitor is designed to mimic the conformation that the P2-P1-P1’P2’-P3’ residues adopt in the active site of Mpro316. In the active site of Mpro316, the P2-P1-P1’P2’-P3’ residues adopt a “kinked” conformation in which the phenyl group of Phe309 at the P3’
position points toward the backbone of Phe305 at the P2 position (Figure 2 inset). To mimic this
conformation, we envisioned linking the phenyl group of Phe309 to the backbone of Phe305 to
create a macrocycle. To realize this design, we used the molecular visualization software
PyMOL (version 2.2.2, Schrödinger) to build a model of the envisioned cyclic peptide by
modifying Phe305 and Phe309 in the active site of Mpro316 (Figure 3). In PyMOL, we deleted
residues 301–304 to expose the amino group on Phe305; we also deleted residue 308 and the
carbonyl of Phe309. We then connected the para position of Phe309 to the amino group of
Phe305 with a CH2CO group to create a macrocycle. The newly created amino acid derived from
Phe309 thus constitutes the amino acid AEPA.

Figure 3. Design process for creating the cyclic peptide inhibitor UCI-1 from the C-terminal
autolytic cleavage site that extends into the active site of the enzyme: (1) Delete residues 301–
304 and 308 as well as the carbonyl of Phe309. (2) Build a CH2CO group on the para position of
the phenyl group on Phe309. (3) Create a bond between the carbonyl carbon of the newly created
CH2CO group on Phe309 and the amino group of Phe305, and then invert the stereochemistry of
Phe305. (4) Mutate Gly307 to serine.
We recognized that upon linking Phe309 and Phe305 as described above, Phe305 and
Gln306 were poised to form a β-turn in which the carbonyl of AEPA hydrogen bonds with the

amino group of Gly307. We envision that β-turn formation in the cyclic peptide inhibitor will
promote rigidity of the cyclic scaffold. To introduce additional conformational rigidity to the
macrocycle, we also mutated Gly307 to serine, which is the most common residue at the P1’
position among the 11 known SARS-CoV-2 Mpro cleavage sites. The resulting cyclic peptide
inhibitor UCI-1 was then synthesized and further studied as described below.
Synthesis of UCI-1. We synthesized UCI-1 by Fmoc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis
of the protected linear peptide H2N-FQSK-AEPA-COOH on 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin
followed by cleavage of the linear protected peptide from the resin and subsequent solutionphase macrocyclization and global deprotection (Scheme 1). UCI-1 was purified using reversephase HPLC. The synthesis and purification proceeded smoothly on a 0.1 mmol scale and
yielded 22 mg of purified UCI-1 as the TFA salt. Detailed procedures for synthesis of UCI-1 are
given in the Materials and Methods section.

includes purified SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as a fusion protein with maltose binding protein (MBPMpro), the fluorogenic Mpro substrate Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKM-E(Edans)-NH2, and assay
buffer. For the inhibition assay, we pre-incubated MBP-Mpro with varying concentrations of
UCI-1 (32–512 µM) or with varying concentrations of the acyclic variant of UCI-1, “peptide-1a”
(32–256 µM), in assay buffer for 30 min. We then added the fluorogenic Mpro substrate and
monitored MBP-Mpro activity in a continuous kinetic assay using wavelengths of 360 nm and
460 nm for excitation and emission. In each well, the concentration of MBP-Mpro was 0.2 µM
and the concentration of the fluorogenic substrate was 50 µM. Figure S1 shows the results of the
results of the continuous kinetic assay of UCI-1.
Initial rates for MBP-Mpro activity in the presence or absence of UCI-1 or peptide-1a
were obtained by fitting the linear portions of the curves from the continuous kinetic assay to a
straight line. UCI-1 is active against MBP-Mpro with an IC50 value of ~150 µM (Figure 4A). In
contrast, the linear control peptide-1a shows little or no inhibition at concentrations at or below
256 µM (Figure 4B). There appears to be a slight reduction in rate of cleavage of the fluorogenic
substrate upon addition of 256 µM peptide-1a. This reduction in rate may reflect either slight
inhibition of MBP-Mpro or that the linear peptide acts as a competitive substrate at high
concentrations. These findings indicate that the cyclic structure of UCI-1 is critical for its
activity.

increasing concentrations of UCI-1 (A) or lin-UCI-1 (B). Dose response curves for IC50 values
were determined by non-linear regression. All data are shown as mean ± s.d., n = 3 replicates.
Assessment of cleavage of UCI-1 by Mpro. The amide bond between residues at positions
P1 and P1’ of UCI-1 has the potential to be cleaved by Mpro because residues at these positions
correspond to the cleavage site of Mpro substrates. To determine whether Mpro cleaves UCI-1, we
used LC/MS to analyze UCI-1 in the well solution from the 96-well plate of the enzyme
inhibition assay after 24 hours. To aide in LC/MS identification of the cleavage product of UCI1, we synthesized the authentic UCI-1 Mpro cleavage product “peptide-1b” and spiked the well
solution with peptide-1b.

UCI-1 does not appear to be cleaved by Mpro (Figure 5). LC/MS analysis of the enzyme
inhibition assay well solution with 16 µM UCI-1 spiked with 0.1 µM peptide-1b shows a small
peak at 2.09 minutes that corresponds to peptide-1b (Figure 5B). The peak at 2.09 minutes is
absent in the LC/MS trace acquired before spiking the well solution with peptide-1b (Figure 5A),
indicating that there is not appreciable cleavage of UCI-1 by Mpro. The ion current at 2.09
minutes in the LC/MS trace acquired before spiking with peptide-1b shows no evidence of the
UCI-1 cleavage product (Figure 5C), whereas the ion current at 2.09 minutes in the LC/MS trace
acquired after spiking with peptide-1b shows the mass of peptide-1b (Figure 5D), providing
additional evidence that UCI-1 resists cleavage by Mpro. These findings confirm that UCI-1 acts
as an inhibitor and not a competitive substrate. The resistance of UCI-1 to cleavage by Mpro is
consistent with the observations by others that cyclic peptides often resist proteolytic
cleavage.17,18,19,20,21,22

and then assessed cell death using a lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. At the highest
concentration evaluated (256 µM), UCI-1 elicits little to no LDH release from HEK-293 cells,
indicating that UCI-1 is not cytotoxic at concentrations up to 256 µM (Figure 6).

Conformational analysis and docking of UCI-1. To better understand the threedimensional structure of UCI-1 and how it interacts with the active site of the SARS-CoV-2
Mpro, we performed conformational analysis and docking studies. Conformational searching of
UCI-1 (MacroModel with the MMFFs force field and GB/SA water) revealed that UCI-1 adopts
a global minimum energy conformation that resembles the kinked conformation that residues
305–309 adopt in the active site of Mpro316 (Figures 2 and 7A). In the global minimum energy
conformation, the AEPA residue acts as a rigid spacer, with the Phe, Gln, Ser, and Lys forming a
bridge. As we had envisioned, the Phe and Gln residues adopt a β-turn conformation, with Phe at
the i+1 position and Gln at the i+2 position. The Phe side chain is well situated to fit in the S2

pocket, and the Gln side chain is well situated to fit in the S1 pocket. The Ser, Lys, and AEPA
residues, in turn, are poised to occupy the S1’, S2’, and S3’ pockets. The macrocyclic scaffold of
the cyclic peptide inhibitor appears to be particularly rigid. In the conformational search, the
peptide backbones of most of the conformers adopt the conformation described above, differing
only in side chain geometry and the type of β-turn formed by Phe305 and Gln306 (Figure 7B).
Docking of the lowest energy conformer of UCI-1 with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB 6YB7)
using Autodock Vina reveals that the inhibitor binds the active site of Mpro in the envisioned

CONCLUSIONS
The design and preliminary evaluation of UCI-1 demonstrates that cyclic peptides that
mimic the conformation of linear peptide substrates of Mpro can be developed as inhibitors
against Mpro. Almost all of the Mpro inhibitors that have been reported are linear peptides that
contain a “warhead” that forms a covalent bond with the active cysteine of Mpro. While the
activity of UCI-1 is modest compared to other known Mpro inhibitors, the design and preliminary
evaluation of UCI-1 lays the groundwork for developing additional cyclic peptide inhibitor
analogs of UCI-1 with improved activity against Mpro. Design and development of next
generation UCI-1 analogs will likely produce better inhibitors. Due to the urgency of COVID-19,
we elected to share our initial hit, UCI-1, in this preprint. We hope that doing so will encourage
others to also begin thinking about cyclic peptide inhibitors as promising drug candidates. We
are currently pursuing next generation analogs of UCI-1 predicted to exhibit enhanced activity
against Mpro, and will report our findings from these pursuits in due course.

reaction was run for 2 hours at room temperature. While it was running, the reaction was
monitored by TLC (3:1 EtOAc/hexanes + 10 % MeOH, Rf = 0.44) to determine the consumption
of starting material (Rf = 0.77) and an appearance of fulvene (Rf = 0.81). 10 mL of EtOAc was

then added to the reaction mixture and the organic layer was removed. The aqueous layer was
acidified with 30 mL 1 M HCl, and then 10 mL of EtOAc was added. The organic layer was
washed with water and brine, dried over MgSO4, and solvent was evaporated in vacuo to afford a
white powder (70 %, 0.140 g). The Fmoc-AEPA was used in solid-phase peptide synthesis
without further purification. The product contains a minor contaminant (< 10 %) of FmocAEPA-AEPA-OH, as detected by 1H NMR spectroscopy. HRMS (ESI-TOF) m/z: [M+Na]+ calcd

Synthesis of UCI-1. 2-Chlorotrityl chloride resin (200 mg, 1.6 mmol/g) was added to a
Bio-Rad Poly-Prep chromatography column (10 mL). The resin was suspended in dry CH2Cl2
(10 mL) and allowed to swell for 30 min. The solution was drained from the resin and a solution
of Fmoc-AEPA-OH (0.50 equiv, 64 mg, 0.16 mmol) in 6% (v/v) 2,4,6-collidine in dry CH2Cl2 (8
mL) was added immediately and the suspension was gently agitated for 12 h. The solution was
then drained and a mixture of CH2Cl2/MeOH/N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (17:2:1, 10
mL) was added immediately. The mixture was gently agitated for 1 h to cap the unreacted 2chlorotrityl chloride resin sites. The resin was then washed with dry CH2Cl2 (2x) and dried by
passing nitrogen through the vessel. This procedure yielded 0.26 mmol/g of loaded resin.
The Fmoc-AEPA-2-chlorotrityl resin was transferred to a peptide synthesis coupling
vessel and subjected to cycles of peptide coupling with Fmoc-protected amino acid building
blocks. The linear peptide was synthesized from the C-terminus to the N-terminus. Each
coupling cycle consisted of i. Fmoc-deprotection with 20% (v/v) piperidine in DMF for 5 min
(2x), ii. washing with DMF (3x), iii. coupling of the amino acid (5 equiv) in the presence of
HCTU (4.5 equiv) and 20% (v/v) N-methylmorpholine (2,4,6-collidine) in DMF for 10–20 min.

removed with 20% (v/v) piperidine in DMF. The resin was transferred from the coupling vessel
to a Bio-Rad Poly-Prep chromatography column.
The linear peptide was cleaved from the resin by agitating the resin for 1 h with a
solution of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) in CH2Cl2 (1:4, 7 mL).24 The suspension
was filtered and the filtrate was collected in a 250-mL round-bottomed flask. The resin was
washed with additional HFIP in CH2Cl2 (1:4, 7 mL) and then with CH2Cl2 (2×10 mL). The
combined filtrates were concentrated by rotary evaporation to give a white solid. The white solid
was further dried by vacuum pump to afford the crude protected linear peptide, which was
cyclized without further purification.
The crude protected linear peptide was dissolved in dry DMF (150 mL). HOBt (5 equiv)
and HBTU (5 equiv) were added to the solution. NMM (12 equiv) was added to the solution and
the mixture was stirred under nitrogen for 24 h. The mixture was then concentrated under
reduced pressure to afford the crude protected cyclic peptide.
The protected cyclic peptide was dissolved in TFA/triisopropylsilane (TIPS)/H2O
(18:1:1, 20 mL) in a 250-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a nitrogen-inlet adaptor. The
solution was stirred for 1.5 h. The reaction mixture was then concentrated by rotary evaporation
under reduced pressure to afford the crude cyclic peptide as a thin yellow film on the side of the
round-bottomed flask. The crude cyclic peptide was immediately subjected to purification by
reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC).
The peptide was dissolved in H2O and acetonitrile (7:3, 10 mL), and the solution was
filtered through a 0.2 µm syringe filter and purified by RP-HPLC (gradient elution with 10–30%
CH3CN over 50 min). Pure fractions were concentrated by rotary evaporation and lyophilized.
The synthesis of UCI-1 yielded 22 mg of the peptide as the TFA salt.

Synthesis of peptide-1a. Rink amide AM resin (300 mg, 0.68 mmol/g) was added to a
peptide synthesis coupling vessel. The resin was suspended in dry DMF (10 mL) and allowed to
swell for 30 min. The solution was drained from the resin and the Fmoc group was removed with
20% (v/v) piperidine in DMF for 20 min. The solution was drained and washed with DMF (5x).
Fmoc-AEPA-OH (0.50 equiv, 40.8 mg, 0.102 mmol), HATU (0.5 equiv), and HOAt (0.5 equiv)
in 20% (v/v) 2,4,6-collidine in dry DMF (8 mL) was then added to the resin mixed for 12 h. The
solution was then drained, washed with DMF (3x) and a mixture of acetic anhydride/pyridine
(3:2, 10 mL) was added. The resin was mixed for 15 min to cap the unreacted resin sites. The
resin was then washed with DMF (3x). This procedure yielded 0.17 mmol/g of loaded resin.
The Fmoc-AEPA-Rink amide AM resin was subjected to cycles of peptide coupling with
Fmoc-protected amino acid building blocks as described above, ending with cleavage of the
terminal Fmoc. The resin was then washed with CH2Cl2 (3x) and then dried by pushing N2 gas
through the Poly-Prep column. The peptide was cleaved from the resin and globally deprotected
by mixing the dried resin with TFA/triisopropylsilane (TIPS)/H2O (18:1:1, 10 mL) and gently
rocking for 2.5 hours. The peptide was drained into a glass beaker, precipitated in cold ether, and
subjected to purification by RP-HPLC as described above. The synthesis of peptide-1a yielded
17 mg of the peptide as the TFA salt.
Synthesis of peptide-1b. 2-Chlorotrityl chloride resin (300 mg, 1.6 mmol/g) was added to
a Bio-Rad Poly-Prep chromatography column (10 mL). The resin was suspended in dry CH2Cl2
(10 mL) and allowed to swell for 30 min. The solution was drained from the resin and a solution
of Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH (0.50 equiv, 146.57 mg, 0.24 mmol) in 6% (v/v) 2,4,6-collidine in dry
CH2Cl2 (8 mL) was added immediately and the suspension was gently agitated for 12 h. The
solution was then drained and a mixture of CH2Cl2/MeOH/N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA)

(17:2:1, 10 mL) was added immediately. The mixture was gently agitated for 1 h to cap the
unreacted 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin sites. The resin was then washed with dry CH2Cl2 (2x) and
dried by passing nitrogen through the vessel. This procedure yielded 0.36 mmol/g of loaded
resin.
The Fmoc-Gln(Trt)- 2-chlorotrityl resin was subjected to cycles of peptide coupling with
Fmoc-protected amino acid building blocks as described above, ending with cleavage of the
terminal Fmoc. The resin was then washed with CH2Cl2 (3x) and then dried by pushing N2 gas

13 mg of the peptide as the TFA salt.
Enzyme inhibition assay. A proprietary buffer containing detergent from BPS Bioscience
was used for the inhibition assays. The substrate with the cleavage sites of Mpro (indicated by the
arrow, ↓), Dabcyl-KTSAVLQ↓SGFRKM-E(Edans)-NH2 and (BPS Bioscience), was used in the
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based continuous kinetic assay, using a backwalled 96-well plate. The dequenching of the Edans fluorescence due to the cleavage of the
substrate by MBP-Mpro was monitored at 460 nm with excitation at 360 nm, using a Varioskan
LUX fluorescence spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher) using the top-read mode. Stock solutions
(10 mg/mL) of UCI-1 and peptide-1a were prepared gravimetrically by dissolving the peptides in
deionized H2O. For the determination of the IC50, 0.2 µM SARS-CoV-2 MBP-Mpro was
incubated with UCI-1 or peptide-1a at various concentrations (32–512 µM for UCI-1 and 32–256
µM peptide-1a) in assay buffer at room temperature for 30 min. Afterward, the reaction was

initiated by adding the FRET peptide substrate at a 50 µM final concentration (final volume: 50
µL). The IC50 value for UCI-1 was determined using the GraphPad Prism 8.4.3 software
(GraphPad) by plotting the initial rates. Measurements of enzymatic activity were performed in
triplicate and are presented as the mean ± standard deviations (s.d.).
LC/MS. LC/MS analysis of the pooled 16 µM UCI-1 well solutions from the enzyme
inhibition assay was performed on a Waters Xevo Qtof G2XS equipped with a C4 column. For
both LC/MS traces, 10 µL of the well solution (diluted 1:100 in deionized H2O) was injected on
the column. For the spiking experiment, a 10 mg/mL stock solution of peptide-1b was prepared
gravimetrically in deionized H2O, and an aliquot of the stock solution was diluted in deionized
H2O to create a 10 µM working solution. A 1-µL aliquot of the 10 µM working solution of
peptide-1b was added to 100 µL of the well solution to achieve a final peptide-1b concentration
of 0.1 µM.
LDH release assay. The LDH release assay was performed using the Pierce LDH
Cytotoxicity Assay Kit from Thermo Scientific. Experiments were performed in replicates of
five, and an additional 10 wells were used for controls. Cells were cultured in the inner 60 wells
(rows B–G, columns 2–11) of the 96-well plate. DMEM:F12 media (100 µL) was added to the
outer wells (rows A and H and columns 1 and 12), in order to ensure the greatest reproducibility
of data generated from the inner wells. A 10-mg/mL stock solution of UCI-1 was prepared
gravimetrically in sterile deionized H2O that had been passed through a 0.2 µm nylon syringe
filter. The stock solution was used to create a 2560 µM solution of UCI-1, which was serially
diluted in sterile deionized H2O to create 10X working solutions of UCI-1.
HEK-293 cells were plated in a 96-well plate at 15,000 cells per well. Cells were
incubated in 100 µL of a 1:1 mixture of DMEM:F12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine

serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and
allowed to adhere to the bottom of the plate for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the culture media was
removed and replaced with 90 µL of serum-free DMEM:F12 media. A 10-µL aliquot of the
working solutions of UCI-1 was added to each well, for well concentrations of 256 µM to 32
µM. Experiments were run in replicates of five. Five wells were used as controls and received
10-µL aliquots of sterile deionized water (vehicle). Another five wells were left untreated, to be
subsequently used as controls with lysis buffer for the LDH release assay. Cells were incubated
at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 72 hours.
After 72 hours, 10 µL of 10x lysis buffer — included with the assay kit — was added to
the five untreated wells, and the cells were incubated for an additional 45 min. After 45 min, a
50-µL aliquot of the supernatant media from each well was transferred to a new 96-well plate
and 50 µL of LDH substrate solution, prepared according to manufacturer’s protocol, was added
to each well. The treated plates were stored in the dark for 30 min. The absorbance of each well
was measured at 490 and 680 nm (A490 and A680). Data were processed by calculating the
differential absorbance for each well (A490−A680) and comparing those values to those of the lysis
buffer controls and the untreated controls:
% cell death = [(A490−A680)compound − (A490−A680)vehicle] ⁄ [(A490−A680)lysis − (A490−A680)vehicle]
Docking of UCI-1 to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The model of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was
generated as follows: Starting coordinates of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were generated from the SARSCoV-2 Mpro crystallographic structure (PDB 6YB7) using PyMOL and saved as a new PDB file.
In PyMOL the dimethyl sulfoxide molecule that sits in the active site of 6YB7 was deleted.
iBabel was used to convert the UCI-1 minimized structured PDB file into a PDBQT file prior to
docking. Docking was performed using AutoDock Tools and AutoDock Vina. In AutoDock

Tools, a grid was chosen to encompass the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in the size of
25x25x25 Å and with the coordinates x = 9.250, y = -5.944, z = 18.944. SARS CoV-2 Mpro was
treated as a rigid receptor in these calculations. The lowest energy cluster, as determined by
AutoDock Vina was chosen to represent the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro UCI-1 interaction model in
Figure 7C.
