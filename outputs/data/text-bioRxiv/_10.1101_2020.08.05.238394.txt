SUMMARY
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created an urgent need for
therapeutics that inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus and suppress the fulminant inflammation
characteristic of advanced illness. Here, we describe the anti-COVID-19 potential of PTC299, an
orally available compound that is a potent inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH),
the rate-limiting enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. In tissue culture,
PTC299 manifests robust, dose-dependent, and DHODH-dependent inhibition of SARS CoV-2
replication (EC50 range, 2.0 to 31.6 nM) with a selectivity index >3,800. PTC299 also blocked
replication of other RNA viruses, including Ebola virus. Consistent with known DHODH
requirements for immunomodulatory cytokine production, PTC299 inhibited the production of
interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17A (also called IL-17), IL-17F, and vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) in tissue culture models. The combination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, cytokine
inhibitory activity, and previously established favorable pharmacokinetic and human safety
profiles render PTC299 a promising therapeutic for COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a serious threat to public health.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID19, is a positive-sense, single-stranded-RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family that shares 79.5%
sequence identity with SARS-CoV (Huang et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a; Wu et
al., 2020b; Zhou et al., 2020b; Zhu et al., 2020). While both viruses are likely descendants of bat
coronaviruses, the proximal source of this zoonotic virus is unknown (Zhou et al., 2020b). Since
its first description at the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread around the globe, infecting
millions of people, and killing hundreds of thousands (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu). An urgent
medical need exists for effective treatments for this disease.
In the early stages of COVID-19, the virus proliferates rapidly, and in some cases, triggers a
cytokine storm - an excessive production of inflammatory cytokines (Quartuccio et al., 2020;
Wiersinga et al., 2020). This uncontrolled inflammation can result in hyperpermeability of the
vasculature, multi-organ failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death (Gupta
et al., 2020; Jose and Manuel, 2020; Quartuccio et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a; Zhou et al.,
2020a). Acute respiratory distress syndrome is one of the leading causes of mortality in COVID19 (Moore and June, 2020). In addition, elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-17 are
reported to be associated with severe pulmonary complications and death (Pacha et al., 2020;
Ruan et al., 2020; Russell et al., 2020).
A therapeutic that can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication while attenuating the cytokine storm
would be highly beneficial for both the early and late stages of COVID-19. Targeting the cellular
de novo pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway is one potential approach to treat both
phases of COVID-19 as viral replication and over-production of a subset of inflammatory

cytokines are controlled by pyrimidine nucleotide levels (Cheung et al., 2017; Xiong et al.,
2020). Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway, is
located on the inner membrane of mitochondria and catalyzes the dehydrogenation of
dihydroorotate (DHO) to orotic acid, ultimately resulting in the production of uridine and
cytidine triphosphates (UTP and CTP) (Figure 1) (Munier-Lehmann et al., 2013).
The de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway is also critical for the excessive production of
a subset of inflammatory cytokines (including interferon-gamma, monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1 [MCP-1], IL-5, and IL-6) in both cultured cells and animal models of viral infection
(Cheung et al., 2017; Xiong et al., 2020). Consistent with DHODH being mechanistically central
to COVID-19, a recent multi-omics study of drug targets for viral infections prioritized DHODH
inhibition as one of the top three mechanisms to consider for SARS-CoV-2 treatment (Zheng et
al., 2020).
PTC299 is an orally bioavailable potent inhibitor of DHODH (Cao et al., 2019). Treatment of
cultured cells with PTC299 results in inhibition of DHODH activity, leading to increased levels
of DHO, the substrate for the DHODH enzyme (Cao et al., 2019). Similar findings were
documented in PTC299-treated cancer patients, where administration of PTC299 resulted in
increased blood levels of DHO, indicating successful inhibition of DHODH in these patients
(Cao et al., 2019). These results are consistent with increased DHO levels observed in Miller
syndrome patients who carry mutations in the DHODH gene that reduce DHODH activity
(Duley et al., 2016) and with studies showing that PTC299 not only inhibits vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) levels in cultured cells, but also normalized VEGF levels in cancer
patients (Cao et al., 2019). VEGF is a stress-regulated cytokine the levels of which are increased
in these patients (Plotkin et al., 2009).

In studies of over 300 human subjects, including healthy volunteers and oncology patients,
PTC299 has manifested a favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and has been generally well
tolerated. The mechanism of action and the favorable PK and safety profiles of PTC299 support
its investigation for use as a therapeutic for COVID-19. Here, we evaluated the in vitro antiviral
activity of PTC299 against a panel of RNA viruses, with a specific focus on SARS-CoV-2, as
well as the drug’s ability to attenuate the excessive production of inflammatory cytokines. Our
results indicate that that PTC299 has considerable potential as a COVID-19 therapeutic.

RESULTS
PTC299 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro
The ability of PTC299 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication was evaluated in vitro using two
virus cell culture models. In the first model, Vero cells were preincubated for 24 hours with
increasing concentrations of PTC299 and cells were subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2 at
a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05. Forty-eight hours after infection, viral protein was
quantified by staining with antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 and with DAPI,
which stains the cells nuclei, to determine cell number. The results demonstrated that PTC299
treatment led to a dose-dependent reduction in the levels of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein
(green) with an EC50 of 1.96 nM (Figures 2A and 2B). DAPI staining of cell nuclei (blue)
showed that PTC299 did not reduce cell number (Figure 2A). These results indicate that PTC299
reduces viral load in the absence of cytotoxicity.

Legend: (A) Quantitative immunofluorescence analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells treated with PTC299.
PTC299 was added at concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 1 µM 30 minutes prior to infection of Vero E6 cells with
SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. At 48 hours post-infection, the cells were
fixed, probed with antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 and stained with AlexaFluor 488
conjugated secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Images acquired in the Green (i.e., NP of SARSCoV-2) and the Blue (DAPI) channels were overlaid and are displayed as indicated (note images corresponding to
the 3 nM concentration of PTC299 were omitted for simplicity). Scale bar, 200 µm.
(B) In order to quantify viral infection, images acquired in A were subjected to quantitative image analysis to determine
the number of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid positive cells at each concentration of PTC299 (i.e., 1, 3, 10, 100 nM and 1
µM). Normalized percent numbers of nucleocapsid positive cells were plotted against Log10 transforms of PTC299
concentrations and the IC50 was estimated using non-linear regression (goodness-of-fit R-squared = 0.9653). Data is
plotted as the mean and standard deviation of 3 independent replicates.

In a second cell culture model, the efficacy of PTC299 in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication
was further evaluated. Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 0.05 and PTC299
was added at increasing concentrations at various times from 18 hours pre-infection to 2 hours
post-infection. Viral titer was quantified by collecting the medium from the infected cell cultures
and determining the TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose). The 50% and 90% effective
concentrations (EC50 and EC90, respectively) of PTC299 were calculated. In parallel, the
concentration of PTC299 necessary to reduce cell viability by 50% (cytotoxic concentration;
CC50) in the absence of infection was determined by measuring intracellular ATP levels, and the
selectivity index was calculated as CC50/EC50.
Preincubation of Vero cells with PTC299 at concentrations of 250, 500, and 1000 nM for 2
hours prior to viral infection reduced viral replication by approximately 3 orders of magnitude
after 24 hours for all concentrations tested (Figure 3A). To determine whether the effect of
PTC299 is a direct consequence of DHODH inhibition, excess uridine (100 µM) was added to
the treatment media. Exogenously added uridine prevented the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2
replication by PTC299 (Figure 3B) consistent with the drug inhibiting DHODH to block viral
replication. PTC299 also inhibited viral replication when added to the cells 18 hours prior to
infection, added at the time of infection, or added 2 hours post-infection (see Supplemental
Material Figure 1).
The initial concentration range of PTC299 explored did not enable the determination of EC50
and EC90 for PTC299 against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, a range of lower concentrations of
PTC299 (from 1 pM to 1 µM) was evaluated. The EC50 and EC90 values were determined to be
2.6 nM and 53 nM, respectively (Figure 3C and Table 1), which is consistent with the findings of
the immunofluorescence experiments described in Figure 2. The EC50, determined as the

midpoint of the logarithmic curve, was 31.6 nM. Using a similar calculation based on the
logarithmic curve, the EC90 was determined to be 80.3 nM. At the highest concentration of
PTC299 tested (10 µM), the CC50 was determined to be >10 µM (Figure 3D and Table 1),
indicating, similar to the immunofluorescence experiments described above, that PTC299
reduces viral load with little cell death.

PTC299 has broad-spectrum antiviral activity
The results in Figures 2 and 3 indicate that PTC299 is a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2
replication. Considering its mechanism of inhibiting cellular de novo pyrimidine synthesis and
the established role of pyrimidine nucleotides in viral replication, we investigated the spectrum
of activity of PTC299 against a panel of RNA viruses of both positive and negative genome
polarity. PTC299 was found to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity against the RNA viruses
tested (Table 1). PTC299 was a highly potent inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicon
genotype 1b, poliovirus, Ebola virus, and Rift Valley fever virus (EC50 ≤36 nM). The CC50
values indicated minimal cytotoxicity in most of the viral infection models and were generally
above the highest concentrations of PTC299 tested.

PTC299 inhibits production of inflammatory cytokines
PTC299 was originally identified as a compound that modulates expression of stressregulated proteins like VEGF and was only subsequently found to be a DHODH inhibitor (Cao
et al., 2019; Weetall et al., 2016). DHODH inhibitors have been shown to suppress virallyinduced inflammatory cytokine production (Xiong et al., 2020). The effect of PTC299 on

cytokine production and release into the cell culture medium was assessed in the Biologically
Multiplexed Activity Profiling (BioMAP) assay profiling platform. This system consists of cocultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) with other cell types, including B cells,
fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, allowing for the measurement of physiologically relevant
biomarker readouts of the activity of a test compound (Berg et al., 2006; Kunkel et al., 2004a;
Kunkel et al., 2004b). Each co-culture was stimulated to recapitulate relevant signaling networks
that naturally occur in healthy human tissue and under certain disease states. For each system,
cytotoxicity and cellular proliferation were assessed. PTC299 was added at increasing
concentrations to each of the model systems one hour before cellular stimulation and remained
present during the stimulation period for each co-culture. Cytokine production was subsequently
assessed.
PTC299 was found to be a potent inhibitor of the production of a subset of
immunomodulatory and inflammation-related cytokines that are associated with the stress
response and poor prognosis in COVID-19 (Figure 4). In the SAg co-cell culture system, which
models T-cell activation, PTC299 treatment resulted in significant decreases of MCP-1, CD40,
and IL-8, as levels decreased after 24 hours of stimulation (Table 2). Compared with the control,
31% and 27% reductions in MCP-1 and IL-8, respectively, were observed when cells were
incubated with 10 nM PTC299, and a 29% decrease in CD40 was detected with 100 nM PTC299
(all p values <0.01). A 23% reduction in endothelial cellular proliferation as measured by SRB (a
measure of cell biomass) relative to control was seen following treatment with PTC299 at 100
nM (p<0.01) but not at 1 or 10 nM.
In the BT co-cell culture system, which models chronic inflammatory conditions driven by B
cell activation and antibody production, incubation of cells with 10 nM PTC299 resulted in a

significant reduction in the levels of soluble (s)IgG, sIL-17A, sIL-17F, sIL-6, and sTNFα
released from the cells after 72 hours of stimulation (range, 49% to 68%) (all p values <0.01)
(Figure 4 and Table 2). The production of sIgG was also significantly decreased by 97%
following 144 hours of stimulation (p <0.01). Similar to results obtained in the SAg co-cell
culture system, 100 nM PTC299 significantly inhibited proliferation (31%) compared with
control (p<0.05).
In the HDFSAg co-cell culture system, which models chronic T cell activation and
inflammation responses within a tissue setting, PTC299 was associated with significantly lower
levels of secreted MCP-1, IL-8, MMP-1, sIL-10, sIL-17A, sIL-17F, sIL-2, sIL-6, sTNFα and
sVEGF compared with control (all p values <0.01) (Figure 4 and Table 2). PTC299 inhibition of
cytokine production was particularly apparent for sIL-17F, sIL-6, and sVEGF, where a
significant reduction in the levels of these cytokines was observed at as low as 1 nM PTC299
(range 33% to 90%; all p values <0.01). No significant differences between co-cultures treated
with PTC299 or the control were seen with regard to proliferation or cytotoxicity.
In the /TH2 co-cell culture system, a model of mixed vascular Th1 and Th2 type
inflammation that creates a pro-angiogenic environment promoting vascular permeability and
recruitment of mast cells, basophils, eosinophils and T and B cells, significant inhibition of
MCP-1 and sIL-17A production was seen as relative to controls (all p values <0.01) (Figure 4
and Table 2). Significant inhibition of MCP-1 production of 21% was observed when cells were
incubated with 10 nM PTC299 (p<0.01). Similar to results obtained with the HDFSAg co-culture
system, treatment with PTC299 did not result in a significant decrease in cell proliferation or
increased cytotoxicity in the /TH2 system.

PTC299 Inhibits IL-17 Production in Th17 cells
IL-17A and IL-17F are cytokines produced by activated T-helper-17 (Th17) cells that
mobilize and activate neutrophils. In COVID-19, disease severity is positively correlated with
levels of IL-17A, and the levels of this cytokine are increased in patients in the intensive care
unit (Megna et al., 2020; Pacha et al., 2020). Results from the BioSeek analysis described above
using the BT and HDFSAg co-cell culture systems demonstrated that PTC299 significantly
inhibits the production of IL-17A and IL-17F. The ability of PTC299 to decrease IL-17A and IL17F levels was further verified by assessing the effects of PTC299 on the production of IL-17A

and IL-17F by Th17 cells, a subset of CD4 T cells that produce these cytokines (Martinez et al.,
2012).
The ability of PTC299 to inhibit the production of secreted IL-17A and IL-17F was assessed
in a model system in which PBMCs were stimulated with human T-activator CD3/CD28
Dynabeads in a culture containing cytokines and antibody to induce Th17 differentiation. The
model culture system was incubated with increasing levels of PTC299. Consistent with the
BioMap results, PTC299 inhibited the production of IL-17A and IL-17F in tissue culture
medium in a dose-dependent manner, with >70% inhibition being observed at doses of ≥75 nM
(Figures 5A and 5B). The inhibition was specific for PTC299, as the inactive R-enantiomer of
this compound, PTC-371 (Cao et al., 2019) and teriflunomide, a DHODH inhibitor with a
relatively high EC50 (26.1 µM) (Xiong et al., 2020), did not inhibit the production of IL-17A and
IL-17F. A different DHODH inhibitor, brequinar, also inhibited IL-17A and IL-17F production,
but at substantially higher concentrations than PTC299. Addition of 100 µM uridine rescued the
PTC299-dependent inhibition consistent with PTC299 acting on DHODH (Figures 5C and 5D).

DISCUSSION
COVID-19 is characterized by an early stage of viral replication followed in some cases by
overproduction of inflammatory cytokines. Both the viral replication and the cytokine response
are dependent upon pyrimidine nucleotides produced by the de novo biosynthesis pathway
(Cheung et al., 2017; Xiong et al., 2020). The results presented here demonstrate that PTC299
has a dual mechanism of action that inhibits viral replication and attenuates the production of a
subset of inflammatory cytokines. PTC299 potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro,
with an EC50 of 2.6 nM (31.6 nM based on the logarithmic curve), and an antiviral selectivity of
>3,800. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by PTC299 was prevented by the addition of
exogenous uridine, which obviated the requirement for the de novo pyrimidine nucleotide
synthesis pathway, consistent with the drug functioning as a DHODH inhibitor and with the fact
that many RNA viruses require high concentrations of pyrimidine nucleotides to transcribe or
replicate the viral genomes (Xiong et al., 2020). Accordingly, PTC299 also demonstrated broadspectrum antiviral activity (Table 1).
A unique aspect of a DHODH inhibitor such as PTC299 is its ability to affect both viral
replication and attenuate the cytokine storm (Breedveld and Dayer, 2000; Li et al., 2013; Xiong
et al., 2020). The cytokine response associated with COVID-19 dramatically complicates the
course of the infection in some patients and can result in ARDS with a high mortality rate.
Experience with other viral infections indicates that treating the excessive inflammatory immune
events downstream of the infection is paramount to patient recovery (Quartuccio et al., 2020).
Studies presented here demonstrated that PTC299 inhibited production of multiple cytokines,
including MCP-1, IL-6, TNFα, VEGF, and IL-17.

Inhibition of IL-6, IL-17, VEGF, and IgG by PTC299 may be of particular importance for
treating COVID-19. IL-6 appears to play a key role in excessive cytokine production resulting
from viral infection and pulmonary complications in COVID-19 (Ruan et al., 2020; Russell et
al., 2020). Preliminary results from two small studies suggest inhibition of the IL-6 pathways by
tocilizumab and siltuximab resulted in treatment benefit for COVID-19 patients (Gritti et al.,
2020; Xu et al., 2020). Comparable to what was found for MERS-CoV and SAR-CoV infections,
IL-17A has also been associated with disease severity and lung injury in COVID-19 (Pacha et
al., 2020). Similarly, increased VEGF levels promote vascular permeability and leakage, helping
in the pathophysiology of hypotension and pulmonary dysfunction (Teuwen et al., 2020). The
attenuation of expression of these cytokines by PTC299 that result from SARS-CoV-2 infection
may provide important and unique therapeutic benefits. The reduction in the levels of IgG
production by PTC299 may also be a clinically meaningful aspect of PTC299 treatment; elevated
IgG levels has been shown to be associated with the severity of COVID-19 (Tan et al., 2020;
Zhao et al., 2020).
The novel dual mechanism of action of PTC299 distinguishes it from most other therapeutics
being investigated in the clinic for the treatment of COVID-19, as many of these target either
viral-specific processes or the immune response, but not both. Due to its dual mechanism of
action, PTC299 is expected to be effective in treating both early and later stages of COVID-19.
This contrasts with direct-acting antivirals that typically show their greatest effectiveness
primarily in the early phase of the disease. Further, since PTC299 targets a cellular gene product
(DHODH), and it is unlikely that viruses can overcome the need for pyrimidine nucleotides, the
likelihood that the therapeutic effect of PTC299 will be compromised by the development of

viral resistance is low. This may be particularly important for RNA viruses whose high mutation
frequency often promotes evasion of direct-acting antivirals.
PTC299 is a highly potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication, with an EC50 of 2.6 nM.
Several other DHODH inhibitors have also shown activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Xiong et al.,
2020), including teriflunomide, an FDA approved treatment for relapsing forms of multiple
sclerosis. Teriflunomide has an EC50 of 26.1 µM , and similar to PTC299, has also been shown
to have broad spectrum antiviral activity (Xiong et al., 2020).
Several other compounds that are under evaluation in the clinic for the treatment of SARSCoV-2 infection have EC50 values reported to be the micromolar range. While these compounds
have different mechanisms of action than PTC299, it is notable that the reported EC50 of
remdesivir is 770 nM, that of chloroquine is 1.1 to 5.5 µM, and that of hydroxycholorquine is
720 nM (Choy et al., 2020; Sanders et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b; Xiong et al., 2020; Yao et
al., 2020).
The key to a successful COVID-19 treatment is to not only have a potent molecule, but to
also have a dose that can be delivered safely and that will sustain exposure in the blood to inhibit
viral replication or infection. PTC299 is currently being evaluated to treat COVID-19 in the
phase 2/3 study PTC299-VIR-015-COV19 (referred to as FITE19)
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04439071?term=PTC299+AND+COVID&draw=2&ran
k=1). The dose being used is based on a PK/pharmacodynamic relationship obtained in monkeys
and in cancer patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), and the well-characterized PK
profile from healthy volunteer and oncology studies (Cao et al., 2019)(data on file). The PTC299
dose in the FITE19 study is predicted to yield a Cave of 1371 ng/mL and will thus be ~1100-fold
higher than the drug’s EC50 and ~55-fold greater than the EC90 values against SARS-CoV-2. The

PTC299 levels would also be ~12-fold higher than the 250 nM concentration that resulted in the
3-log reduction in the titer of SARS-CoV-2 in cultured Vero cells.
In summary, PTC299 is a highly potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication that also
suppresses production of a subset of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting it has the potential
to act through this dual mechanism to treat the viral and immune components of COVID-19. Due
to its ability to block viral replication and cytokine production, PTC299 may be effective in
treating both early and later stages of the disease. This contrasts with direct-acting antivirals that
typically show their greatest effectiveness primarily in the early phase of the disease (McNicholl
and McNicholl, 2001; Xiong et al., 2020) and with anti-inflammatory drugs that treat only the
later phase of COVID-19 (Moore and June, 2020; Quartuccio et al., 2020). It has been argued
that it is important to combine antiviral therapy with immune suppressants as using only
compounds that modify the immune response to treat the cytokine storms may make viral
clearance more difficult (Quartuccio et al., 2020). Importantly, PTC299 is orally bioavailable,
has been extensively evaluated in human subjects, has well established PK and safety profiles
and is generally well tolerated. These findings and prior clinical experience with PTC299 support
the further development of this novel molecule for the treatment of COVID-19.

Poliovirus (CCL-2) was obtained from ATCC. The received virus was amplified in HeLa
cells, grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin solution
and the titer evaluated by plaque assay on HeLa cell monolayers.
Detailed Methods
SARS-CoV-2 viral yield assay
Vero cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations (1 nM to 1 µM) of PTC299 or
PTC299 with 100 µM uridine. After incubation at 37°C overnight, medium was removed, and
cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05. After 1
hour of incubation at 37°C inCO2, wells were washed 3 times with dilution medium and 1 mL of
medium containing the indicated compound doses was added back to each well. Cells were
incubated at 37°C and samples collected at 0, 16, and 24 hours post-infection. Collected
timepoint medium was replaced with an equal amount of 1x compound or dilution medium.
Samples were stored at -80°C until the day of analysis. The SARS-CoV-2 titer in Vero cells via
50% tissue culture infectious dose assay (TCID50) was performed for each sample collected at 0,
16, and 24 hours post-infection.
For cytotoxicity determination, Vero cells were plated at 1e5 or 2e5 cells/ml DMEM
containing 5% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin solution. Cells were treated with
PTC299 at concentrations from 1 nM to 10 µM. At 16, 24, or 48 hours post-treatment,
cytotoxicity was measured by Cell Titer-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA).
Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 infection levels by quantitative immunofluorescence analysis
African Green Monkey Vero E6 cells were plated in 96-well plates at 1x104 cells per well.

PTC299 in DMSO or they were untreated for 30 minutes at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cells were
subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 by adding 10
µL of the diluted virus to each well. Experiments were conducted in triplicates using three wells
of a 96-well plate per condition.
Two days post infection, cells were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 6
hours at 4°C and removed from the BSL-4 laboratory. The cells were permeabilized with 1:1
(vol:vol) acetone-methanol solution for 5 min at -20°C, incubated in 0.1 M glycine for 10 min at
room temperature, and subsequently incubated in blocking reagent (2% bovine serum albumin,
0.2% Tween 20, 3% glycerin, and 0.05% NaN3 in PBS) for 20 minutes at room temperature.
After each step, the cells were washed three times in PBS, and then incubated for 1 hour at room
temperature with a rabbit antibody directed against the SARS-CoV nucleoprotein (Rockland
Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA). This antibody cross-reacts with the SARS-CoV-2
nucleoprotein. The cells were washed four times in PBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit
antibody conjugated with AlexaFluor488 (Invitrogen) for 1 hour at room temperature. 4',6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was used at 200 ng/mL for
nuclei staining.
Cells were stored at 4°C in PBS prior to imaging. Images were acquired using a with
Photometrics Prime BSI sCMOS camera attached to a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 microscope, equipped
with a Nikon N Plan Apo λ 4X/0.20 ∞/- WD20. Acquisition was driven using the NIS Elements
AR software (Nikon). Four tiles were acquired per well and tiles were stitched together using the
NIS Element AR Software. Two channels were acquired per tile using the Nikon C-FL DAPI
and the Nikon C-FL GFP HC HISN Zero Shift filter sets, respectively.

Images corresponding to 4 tiles and 2 channels each, were imported into QuPath software v0.2.0
(https://qupath.github.io/) and subjected to quantitative image analysis using a custom-made
script based on the Multiplexed Analysis procedure
(https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/tutorials/multiplex_analysis.html). SARS-CoV-2
positive cells were counted and their normalized percentage with respect to the total number of
identified cells was plotted against the Log10 transform of the concentration of PTC299. The
non-linear regression of the inverted sigmoid curve was calculated using GraphPad Prism 8.
Data management was performed using the OMERO.web client (v5.4.6-ice36-b87) and the
OMERO server v5.4.6 (https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/.
PTC299 activity against RNA virus panel
For poliovirus antiviral assay, HeLa cells were seeded at 5000/well in 96-well plates the day
before infection in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were treated with
serially diluted test compounds 16 hours pre-infection. The final concentration of dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) in the media was 0.5%. Cells were infected with 0.1 plaque forming units per
cell of poliovirus (PV) and incubated at 37°C. Twenty hours post-infection, cells were lysed, and
quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed using
primers to the poliovirus genome and to human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH), a cellular reference gene, Predeveloped TaqMan® assay reagents (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Concentration required for 50% inhibition of viral genomic RNA
compared to mock treated control (EC50) was reported as the concentration of test compound
required to cause a 50% reduction in PV RNA and was normalized to GAPDH levels in the same
well. The concentration required for 50% inhibition of cellular GAPDH RNA compared to mock
treated control (CC50) was reported as the concentration of test compound that caused a 50%

reduction in GAPDH mRNA. The experiment was repeated 3 times for this study and average
EC50 and CC50 values are reported.
HCV replicon studies were performed as previously described. Huh-7 (hepatocarcinoma)
cells harboring the subgenomic HCV genotype 1b (Con1) replicon (referred to as 1b replicon
cells) were obtained from ReBLikon GmbH (Gau-Odernheim, Germany) . Replicon cells were
plated at a density of 5000 cells per well in 96-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Serial
dilutions of test compounds in DMSO were added to wells and cells were incubated at 37ºC and
5% CO2 for 3 days prior to determining the extent of inhibition of HCV replicon RNA
replication and the effect of the compound on cell proliferation. The final concentration of
DMSO in the medium was 0.5%. Inhibition of replicon RNA replication was quantified using
real-time RT-qPCR assay. At the end of compound treatment, the cells were lysed with Cell-tocDNA lysis buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX). RT-PCR was carried out using TaqMan® One-Step
RT-PCR master mix reagents kit (Applied Biosystems) with HCV primers (sense S66
[ACGCAGAAAGCGTCTAGCCAT] and anti-sense A165 [TACTCACCGGTTCCGCAGA])
and probe (5’ -6FAM-TCCTGGAGGCTGCACGACACTCAT - 3’ TAMRA) at a concentration
of 100 µM. The effect of the compound on the abundance of the housekeeping gene GAPDH
mRNA as a control for cytotoxicity was determined by using Predeveloped TaqMan® assay
reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Both HCV replicon and GAPDH RNAs were
amplified in the same well using ABI 7900HT (Applied Biosystems). The quantity of HCV
replicon or GAPDH RNA from each sample was determined by applying PCR cycle-time values
to a standard curve. The percent reduction of HCV RNA in the presence of test compound was
calculated using the formula: [1-(compound treatment sample - background control) / (noncompound treatment control - background control)] X 100. EC50 and EC90 (50% and 90%

effective concentrations, respectively) values were calculated by non-linear regression using
Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). The test was repeated 6 times for this study and
average EC50 and CC50 values are reported.
Evaluation of the effect of PTC299 on Ebola and Rift Valley Fever (RVFV) virus replication
was performed at USAMRIID (Fort Detrick, MD). Assays were performed in 96 well plates and
analyzed by high content screening. Test compounds were administered at a concentration range
of 0.0032 to 2 µM in duplicate. Antiviral assays used a virus engineered to express green
fluorescent protein (EBOV-GFP), and antiviral activity was determined by counting the number
of GFP expressing cells compared to a mock treated control. Cytotoxicity was determined by
counting the number of viable cells compared to mock treated control. For evaluation of efficacy
against Ebola virus, Vero76 cells were seeded at 30,000 cells per well 1 day prior to infection
and pretreated for 18 or 2 hours with test compound. Cells were infected at a multiplicity of
infection of 5 with Ebola-GFP virus and incubated 48 hours at 37°C. For evaluation of efficacy
against Rift Valley fever virus, HeLa cells were seeded at 10,000 cells per well 1 day prior to
infection and pretreated for 2 hours with test compound. Cells were infected at a multiplicity of
infection of 0.1 with RVFV-GFP virus and incubated 48 hours at 37°C.
Evaluation of inhibition of cytokine production
The activity of PT299 was evaluated in complex primary culture human cell systems in the
BioMap assays profiling platform (from BioSeek, now part of Eurofins). Detailed protocols for
the BioMap primary human cell cultures and coculture systems have previously been published
(Berg et al., 2010; Berg et al., 2013; Melton et al., 2013; Shah et al., 2017). These systems
consist of complex co-cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) pooled
from healthy donors with early passage human primary fibroblasts, B-cells, or venular

endothelial cells and are stimulated to recapitulate relevant signaling networks that naturally
occur in human tissue or during specific disease states. In this study, four different co-culture
systems were utilized. PTC299 was prepared in DMSO (final concentration ≤ 0.1%) and was
added at the specified concentrations 1-hr before stimulation and remain in culture for 24-hrs
(sAg system), 48-hrs (HDFSAg system), 72-hrs (BT system, soluble cytokines), or144-hrs (BT
system, secreted IgG)).
SAg system
The SAg system is a co-culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with mitogenic levels of T cell receptor
(TCR) ligands to drive the polyclonal T cell stimulation (defined as 1X TCR ligand strength),
expansion and elevated cytokine release that is characteristic of acute T cell immune activation
and inflammation conditions. HUVEC cells were stimulated with cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1β,
1 ng/mL; TNF-α, 5 ng/mL; and IFN-γ, 100 ng/mL) and the superantigen Staphylococcal
enterotoxin F from Staphylococcus aureus [Sag (20 ng/mL)]. The SAg system also captures the
paracrine signaling between activated immune cells and inflamed endothelial cells that is
relevant for the vascular inflammation.
BT system
The BT system is a co-culture of CD19+ B cells and PBMC that utilizes B cell receptor
(BCR) stimulation and sub-mitogenic TCR stimulation (defined as 1/1000th TCR ligand
strength) to capture the T cell dependent B cell activation and class switching that occurs in
germinal centers. The BT system models diseases and chronic inflammatory conditions driven
by B cell activation and antibody production.

HDFSAg system
The HDFSAg system is a co-culture of human primary dermal fibroblasts and PBMC that is
stimulated with sub-mitogenic TCR levels (defined as 1/1000th TCR ligand strength) to model
chronic T cell activation and inflammation responses within a tissue setting.
/TH2 system
The /TH2 system is a co-culture of HUVEC cells and Th2 blasts stimulated with TCR
ligands (1/10th ligand strength) and cytokines to model mixed vascular T helper type 1 (Th1)
and Th2 type inflammation and create a pro-angiogenic environment that promotes vascular
permeability and recruitment of mast cells, basophils, eosinophils and T and B cells.
For all 4 co-cell culture systems, PTC299 was added to cells at a concentration of 0.1, 1.0, 10,
and 100 nM 1 hr prior to stimulation of the cells and was present during the 48-hr stimulation
period. The effect of PTC299 on the levels of various biomarkers including cytokines, growth
factors, expression of surface molecules, and cell proliferation were monitored. The levels of
protein biomarkers were measured by ELISA. Cytotoxicity was quantified by Alamar blue
reduction, which measures cell viability by evaluating the level of oxidation during respiration.
Cell viability was quantified using Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. SRB bind cellular protein
components and measure the total biomass and proliferation was measured by counting cells.
IL-17A and IL-17F ELISA
PBMCs (Allcells, Inc.) were stimulated with T cell activator CD3/CD28 Dynabeads, that are
coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (Dynabeads; Gibco, Cat#11131D),in the
presence of cytokines and antibodies to promote Th17 differentiation while blocking Th1 and
Th2 differentiation. The final concentration of cytokines was as follows: IL-6 (10 ng/mL), IL-1β

(10 ng/mL), TGF-β1 (5–10 ng/mL), IL-23 (10 ng/mL), and the neutralizing antibodies anti-IL-4
(10 μg/mL) and anti-IFN-γ (10 μg/mL) in culture medium.
For all experiments, a total of 40 µL of cells (1 x 105 cells) were added per well in a 96-well
tissue culture plate. Subsequently, 10 µL of washed Dynabeads or medium were added to each
well and the cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 3 to 4 hours. Following incubation,, 25 µL
of 4x cytokine/Ab mixture (described above) was as added to each well (for the “no stimulating
control”, 25 µL medium was as added) and 25 µL of PTC299, PTC-371 (the inactive enantiomer
of PTC299) (Cao et al., 2019), brequinar, A77, or medium was added. Cells were incubated at
37°C, 5% CO2 for a total 88 hours. After 88 hours, the medium was collected and analyzed by an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (R&D System: IL17 Cat#DY317-05 and
IL17F Cat#DY1335-05) according to manufacturer’s instruction.
Statistical Analysis
Data was analyzed using GraphPad PRISM.
