Abstract

Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, from
parents to early embryos during conception could be catastrophic, but is
contingent on the susceptibility of cells of the embryo to infection. Because
presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been reported in the human reproductive
system, we assessed whether pre-implantation embryos are permissive to SARSCoV-2 entry. RNA-seq and immunostaining studies revealed presence of two key
entry factors in the trophectoderm of blastocyst-stage embryos, the ACE2
receptor and the TMPRSS2 protease. Exposure of blastocysts to fluorescent
reporter virions pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein
revealed S-ACE2 dependent entry and fusion. These results indicate that human
pre-implantation embryos can be infected by SARS-CoV-2, a finding pertinent to
natural human conceptions and assisted reproductive technologies during and
after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as an unexpected, novel, and
devastating pandemic upending life around the globe1. Entry of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the infectious agent responsible for COVID192, requires interactions of its surface glycoprotein Spike (S) with two ‘entry’ factors on
the target cell: engagement of the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) by
S and cleavage of S by the serine protease TMPRSS23,4. These binding and processing
steps lead to subsequent endocytosis of virions and fusion within the late endosome4.
The full repertoire of cell and tissue types that SARS-CoV-2 can infect is now
being defined1,5. Expression of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry factors has been described in a
wide assortment of human cells5, and in COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 virus has
been detected in various organs6-8. Infected individuals can also exhibit a range of
symptoms spanning beyond lung-related problems, to include disease in the intestine,
heart, kidney, vasculature, and liver6,8-12. Within the female and male reproductive
systems, expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors is present in cells of the ovaries,
uterus, vagina, testis, and prostate5,13-16. The virus is also detectable in the semen of
infected males17.
The possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to embryos during or
shortly after fertilization is concerning, but is contingent on cells of the embryo being
permissive to the virus. We now confirm expression of key entry factors for SARS-CoV2 on cells in the embryonic trophectoderm and demonstrate experimentally that reporter

Materials

Human Embryos
All embryos used in this study were surplus samples from fertility treatment and in vitro
fertilization, donated strictly for research by signed informed consent. Ethical approval
for this project was obtained through the IRB of the Zouves Foundation for Reproductive
Medicine (OHRP IRB00011505). For the RNA-seq experiment, embryos were of various
ethnic backgrounds and comprised a mix of euploid and aneuploid samples based on
evaluation by pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A)18 (Suppl. Table
1). For immunofluorescence and infection experiments, embryos were either untested
or assessed by PGT-A, and included a mix of euploid, mosaic, and aneuploid samples
(samples with aneuploidies in chromosomes X or 21, respectively encoding ACE2 and
TMPRSS2, were excluded).

RNA-seq and Expression Analysis
Trophectoderm (TE) biopsies containing 5-10 cells from blastocyst-stage embryos
(n=24) were processed for RNA-seq using a commercial kit (Takara Bio, SMART-Seq
v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing) following the user manual. The resulting
cDNAs were converted to libraries using Illumina Nextera XT kit (with modified protocol
according to SMART-Seq v4 user manual). The resulting libraries were pooled and
sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550 with a MidOutput cartridge at 2x75 cycles. The
sequencing reads in Fastq files were down-sampled to 6M total reads, aligned to the
human genome assembly (hg38), and the number of transcripts per million (TPM) was

determined using the CLC Genomics Workbench 12 (Qiagen). Results were mined for
expression of factors implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Violin plots were prepared
with PlotsOfData19.

Immunofluorescence
Blastocysts were immersed in fixation buffer containing 4% paraformaldehyde (EMS no.
15710) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Seradigm 1500-050) in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS; Corning MT21040CM) for 10 minutes (min) at room temperature (rt),
followed by three 1-min washes at rt in PBS with 10% FBS. Embryos were blocked in
2% horse serum (Sigma H0146) and 0.1% saponin (Sigma S7900) in PBS (blocking
solution) for 1 hour (h) at rt and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in
blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Embryos were then washed three times for 5 min
each in PBS at rt prior to incubation with secondary antibodies. Secondary antibodies
diluted in blocking solution were applied for 1 h at 4 °C. Embryos were then washed
twice for 5 min each in PBS and subsequently incubated with 5 µg/ml Hoechst 33342
(Invitrogen) in PBS for 5 min. Finally, embryos were washed twice for 5 min each in
PBS prior to mounting for imaging. The following primary antibodies were used: goat
anti-ACE2 (R&D Systems AF933, 1:100), mouse anti-TMPRSS2 (Developmental
Hybridoma Bank P5H9-A3, 3.2 µg/ml). The following secondary Alexa Fluor-conjugated
antibodies (Invitrogen) were used at a dilution of 1:500: donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor
568 (A10042), donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (A21202). DNA was visualized using
Hoechst 33342. For all immunofluorescence experiments, n = 5 independent biological
replicates were used.

Pseudotyped Virion Production
For production of HIV-1 NL-43∆Env-eGFP SARS CoV-2 S pseudotyped virus particles,
293T cells were plated at 3.75 x106 cells in a T175 flask. 24 h post plating the cells were
transfected by PEI transfection reagent (Sigma) with 90 µg of PEI, 30 µg of HIV-1 NL4∆Env-eGFP (NIH AIDS Reagent Program) and 3.5 µg of pCAGGS SARS CoV-2 S
Glycoprotein (NR52310, BEI) in a total of 10 ml of Opti-MEM media (Invitrogen). The
day following transfection the media was changed to DMEM10 complete media and
placed at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 48 h. At 48 h the supernatant was harvested, filtered by
0.22 µm Steriflip filters (EMD, Millipore) and then concentrated by ultracentrifugation for
1.5 h at 4 °C and 25K rpm. After concentration the supernatant was removed and virus
particle pellets were resuspended in cold 1xPBS containing 1% FBS, aliquots were
stored at -80 °C. For production of control virus particles not expressing the SARS CoV2 S glycoprotein (Bald), the same procedure was used but with the omission of the
pCAGGS SARS CoV-2 S vector transfection. SARS and MERS pseudotyped virus
particles were produced using the same procedure, substituting the SARS CoV-2 S
expression vector with either pcDNA3.1(+) SARS S or pcDNA3.1(+) MERS S.
For production of VSV∆G SARS CoV-2 S pseudotyped virus particles, 293T cells were
plated at 1.8 x106 cells in a T175 flask. 24 h post plating the cells were transfected by
PEI transfection reagent (Sigma) with 90 µg of PEI, 30 µg of pCAGGS SARS CoV-2 S
Glycoprotein (NR52310, BEI) in a total of 10 mL of Opti-MEM media (Invitrogen). One
day after transfection the media was removed, the cells are washed with 1xPBS and
DMEM10 complete media was added. Once the media was changed the cells were

infected with VSV∆G VSVg virus (Sandia) at an MOI of 1 or higher. The infection media
is changed after 4 h, the cells are washed with 1xPBS and DMEM10 supplemented with
20% anti-VSVg hybridoma supernatant (ATCC CRL-2700). At 24 h the supernatant was
harvested, filtered by 0.22 µm Steriflip filter (EMD, Millipore) and then concentrated by
ultracentrifugation for 1.5 h at 4 °C and 25K rpm. Supernatant was removed and virus
particle pellets were resuspended in cold 1xPBS containing 1% FBS, aliquots were
stored at -80 °C. For production of control virus particles not expressing the SARS CoV2 S glycoprotein (Bald), the same procedure was used but with the omission of the
pCAGGS SARS CoV-2 S vector transfection on day 2.
SARS and MERS pseudotyped virus particles were produced using the same
procedures, substituting the SARS CoV-2 S expression vector with either pcDNA3.1(+)
SARS S or pcDNA3.1(+) MERS S vectors respectively.

Virion Infection
For viral infection experiments, blastocyst-stage embryos (n=94) were hatched from
zona pellucidas mechanically, and transferred to flat bottom 96 well plates in 100 µl
embryo culture media. Either HIV-1 NL-43∆Env-eGFP SARS CoV-2 S pseudotyped
virions (100ng/p24), or VSV∆G SARS CoV-2 S pseudotyped virions (MOI=0.1), were
added to the embryos. Bald (not expressing S glycoprotein) virions and mock infection
conditions were included for each infection experiment. After the addition of the virions,
the embryos were spinoculated at 200 g for 2 h at rt. Upon completion of the
spinoculation an additional 100 µl of embryo culture media was added to each well and
the cultures were placed at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For the HIV-1 NL-43∆Env-eGFP based

infections embryos were monitored for fluorescence at 24-48 h post-spinoculation. For
the VSV∆G based infections embryos were monitored for fluorescence at 12-24 h postspinoculation. Additional controls included conditions with either 10 µg of anti-ACE2
antibody (AF933, R&D Systems), anti-SARS CoV-2 S Neutralizing antibody (SAD-S35,
ACRO) or anti-Human IgG Kappa (STAR 127, Bio-Rad) control antibody.

Microscopy
Embryos were placed into 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek). For epifluorescence
microscopy, embryos were imaged with a EVOS M5000 Imaging System employing a
LPanFL PH2 20X/0.40 lens, and fluorescence light cube for GFP (470/525 nm) and
transmitted light. For confocal microscopy of immunostained embryos, samples were
placed within microdrops of a 4 mg/ml solution of BSA (Sigma) in PBS. Images were
acquired using a Zeiss LSM880 laser-scanning confocal microscope, equipped with an
oil-immersion Zeiss EC Plan-Neofluar 40x/NA1.3/WD0.17mm. Z-stacks were acquired
through whole embryos with an optical section thickness of 1 µm. Fluorescence was
excited with a 405-nm laser diode (Hoechst), a 488-nm Argon laser (Alexa Fluor 488),
and a 561-nm DPSS laser (Alexa Fluor 568). For confocal microscopy of infected
embryos, samples were stained with Hoechst 33342, and images were acquired using
an Olympus FV3000RS laser-scanning microscope using a 40X UPLXAPO (NA= 0.95).
Embryos were simultaneously scanned for Hoechst and GFP using the 405-nm and
488-nm lasers. RapidZ series were taken through the entire volume of the imaged
embryos in 3 µm steps.

Results

Cells of the Embryo Express Genes Required for SARS-CoV-2 Infection
We reasoned that within the pre-implantation period of human development, embryos in
the blastocyst stage are particularly vulnerable as they lose their protective zona
pellucida (ZP) that counters the threat of many foreign agents20. The trophectoderm,
which is the precursor to the the placenta21, is located at the surface of the blastocyst
and may be the specific target of infecting viruses. Hence, we focused our attention on
the trophectoderm and evaluated its permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Two prior publications have described ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in
blastocyst-stage pre-implantation embryos5,22 based on analysis of publicly available
RNA-seq datasets from a single ethnic group (East Asian/Chinese)23-25. To determine
whether this pattern of gene expression is observed in more diverse populations, we
performed RNA-seq on a group of 24 human blastocysts from multiple ethnic
backgrounds (Suppl. Table 1). ACE2 transcripts were detected in trophectoderm
biopsies comprising 5-10 cells in 23 of 24 embryos (95.8%), and TMPRSS2 transcripts
in biopsies from all 24 embryos (Fig.1A). We evaluated the expression of 22 additional
human genes proposed to be involved in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle5 (Fig.1B).
Expression was confirmed for genes encoding putative alternate receptors
(BSG/CD147, ANPEP) and proteases (CTSB, CTSL, TMPRSS4). Transcripts for DPP4,
encoding the receptor used by MERS-CoV to enter cells, were either absent or
expressed at very low levels in our samples.

Genes for two factors apparently required for SARS-CoV-2 genome replication,
TOP3B and ZCRB1/MADP1, were expressed respectively at low and high levels.
Among the genes encoding factors proposed to control trafficking and/or assembly of
viral components and which are known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, RHOA,
RAB10, RAB14, RAB1A, AP2M1, and CHMP2A exhibited high levels of expression
while AP2A2 and TAPT1 were expressed at low levels. Together, these transcriptomic
profiling data indicate that trophectoderm cells express many key factors required for
SARS-CoV-2 entry and subsequent replication.

SARS-CoV-2 Entry Factors Localize to the Membrane of Trophectoderm Cells
To evaluate the presence and localization of entry factors in trophectoderm cells, we
performed immunofluorescence and confocal imaging for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in
blastocysts. Both factors were readily detectable in cells of the trophectoderm; ACE2
was enriched on cellular membranes, as evidenced by strong signal at cell-cell junctions
(Fig. 2A), while the TMPRSS2 pattern was more diffuse, localizing to both cell
membranes and within the cytoplasm but not nucleus (Fig. 2B). The inner cell mass
(ICM) was not evaluated, since the immunofluorescence protocol was not optimized for
penetration of antibodies through cell layers. Localization of ACE2 and TMPRSS2
protein suggests that pre-implantation embryos are potentially permissive to SARSCoV-2 entry.

Human Embryos are Receptive to Entry by SARS-CoV-2 Pseudotyped Reporter
Virions
To test the susceptibility of embryos to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we evaluated the
entry of viral agents expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. In the first series of
experiments (see Table 1), we used an HIV-based reporter virion lacking its native viral
entry factor Env, and encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Embryos exposed
to control media or media containing the original non-pseudotyped ‘bald’ reporter virus
displayed no fluorescence and appeared healthy 24-48 hours after mock spinoculation
(inoculation by centrifugation) (Suppl. Fig. 1). However, when embryos were exposed
to the reporter virus pseudotyped with the S protein from SARS-CoV-2, several showed
robust GFP signal in numerous trophectoderm cells (Fig. 3A). Some embryos showed
both strong GFP signal and evidence of cell degradation (Fig.3A and Suppl. Fig. 1).
Treatment of the blastocysts with neutralizing anti-S antibodies markedly decreased
GFP fluorescence to a limited number of puncta (Suppl. Fig. 1).
In the second experimental series (see Table 1), we used a vesicular stomatitis
virus lacking the cell entry factor G envelope protein (VSV∆G), and encoding GFP as a
reporter. No fluorescence was detected when embryos were exposed to control media
or media containing the non-pseudotyped ‘bald’ virions . Conversely, several samples
exhibited GFP when exposed to the reporter virus pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein (Fig. 3B). Again, some of the infected embryos showed evidence of cellular
degradation 24-48 h after spinoculation (Fig. 3B and Suppl. Fig. 1). Addition of a
neutralizing antibody targeting either S or ACE2 strongly reduced GFP expression,
while a control, non-specific anti-IgG antibody produced no inhibitory effects (Suppl.

Fig. 1). When the VSV∆G-based reporter virus was pseudotyped with the S protein
from SARS-CoV-1, which also utilizes the ACE2 receptor for cell entry, embryos again
displayed GFP signal and occasional evidence of cellular degradation (Suppl. Fig. 1).
Conversely, reporter virus pseudotyped with the S protein from MERS-CoV, which
depends on the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor for cell entry, produced no GFP
signal (Suppl. Fig. 1). Together, these pseudotyped-virion experiments indicate that
pre-implantation embryos are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 entry (and likely SARS-CoV-1
entry), involving interactions of S proteins with the ACE2 receptor.

Discussion

The findings of this study demonstrate the permissiveness of human preimplantation embryos to SARS-CoV-2 entry. Transcript and protein profiling show the
presence of the required receptor and protease in cells of the trophectoderm, the
embryo’s outer cell layer, which is essential for embryo implantation and later in
pregnancy forms the placenta. Pseudotyped virion experiments indicate effective entry
is achieved when SARS-CoV-2 S binds to human ACE2 receptors.
Our RNA-seq experiments show that embryos from multiple ethnic backgrounds
express the canonical entry factor genes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in trophectoderm cells.
These findings confirm and extend prior reports of ACE2 and TRMPRSS2 embryonic
expression in a single ethnic group (East Asian/China)23-25. The localization of ACE2 we
observe on the membrane of trophectoderm cells is in agreement with a previous study
employing a different commercially-available anti-ACE2 antibody for
immunofluorescence microscopy26. In addition, we detect the TMPRSS2 protein in the
same cell population of the embryo, a strong indication that SARS-CoV-2 could indeed
enter trophectoderm cells via the canonical ACE2-TMPRSS2 pathway.
The experiments using reporter virions confirm our hypothesis. Only virions
pseudotyped with the S protein could infect cells of the embryo, and interfering with
either S or ACE2 with neutralizing antibodies reduces infection by the pseudotyped
virions, implicating a functional interplay between S and ACE2 for cell entry. Embryos
also displayed evidence of infection by reporter virions pseudotyped with the S protein
from SARS-CoV-1 (which similarly uses ACE2 for entry) but not with the S protein from

MERS-CoV (which uses DPP4 for entry), again suggesting that ACE2 functions as an
effective coronavirus receptor in trophectoderm cells.
The finding that pre-implantation embryos are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2
infection raises the possibility of viral transmission from either the mother or father to the
developing embryo. Although the data remains limited, vertical transmission of SARSCoV-2 between pregnant mothers and fetuses has been reported27-30, albeit
considerably later in pregnancy. Of note, the studies implicate the placenta, which
develops from the trophectoderm, as the principal site of transmission29,31. Vertical
transmission to the embryo before implantation would necessarily require exposure to
SARS-CoV-2 virions at this precise stage. While cell entry factors are present in various
cells in the female reproductive tract13,16, to date there have been no confirmed reports
of SARS-CoV-2 infection in those tissues32. For example, a study showed that none of
16 oocytes from two asymptomatic positive women contained detectable virus33.
However, some evidence suggesting that infected males may transmit the virus is
emerging. In one study, six of 38 male COVID-19 patients had detectable levels of
SARS-CoV-2 in their semen17. Moreover, microlesions in any part of the male or female
reproductive systems could translate to exposure of pre-implantation embryos to the
virus since SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in the blood of infected patients34.
In comparison to embryos from natural conceptions, embryos generated by
assisted reproductive technologies (ART) for treatment of infertility, such as in vitro
fertilization (IVF), face additional avenues of potential viral exposure. These include
exposure to virus shed by asymptomatically infected medical and laboratory personnel
during handling of gametes, assisted conception, embryo culture, intrauterine transfer,

or extended cryopreservation. Guidelines regarding best practices in the ART clinic
during the COVID-19 pandemic have been recently described35-39, however we feel
these recommendations merit revision in light of the data presented here.
An unexpected additional finding is the toxicity of the pseudotyped virions for
infected cells. We observed various degrees of cell degradation in embryos that showed
GFP expression, ranging from subtle to pronounced evidence of blebbing or cell debris
with GFP positive puncta, and, in a few instances, total embryo demise. This was the
case with both HIV- and VSV∆G-based reporter virions. The cytotoxicity might be
produced by S engaging ACE2, resulting in signaling and activation of a cell death
program in cells of the embryo. Alternatively, toxicity might occur as a result of
transcription and translation of reporter virus genes. It will be interesting to assess the
effects of live SARS-CoV-2 infection on these blastocysts.
SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women is associated with increased risk of
miscarriage, prematurity, and impaired fetal growth40. Such adverse fetal outcomes
have mainly been attributed to COVID-19-related complications in pregnant patients40,
but could also reflect infection of the fetus during pregnancy27-30. The present study
further indicates that vertical transmission during pre-implantation stages might
contribute to such complications and should not be ruled out. Given the trophectoderm’s
central role in implantation of an embryo into the maternal endometrium, compromised
health of trophectoderm cells due to SARS-CoV-2 infection could altogether impede
establishment of a pregnancy. Alternatively, lasting detrimental effects on the
trophectoderm-derived placenta could affect the clinical outcome of an established
pregnancy. Noting that our transcriptomic analysis revealed RNA presence of various

factors associated with downstream steps of the SARS-CoV-2 viral life cycle, such as
genome replication, trafficking and assembly5, the possibility of trophectoderm cells
infecting surrounding tissues (maternal or fetal) after additional viral shedding cannot be
excluded. Ultimately, population effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility may
become apparent when epidemiological data on pregnancies and birth rates become
more readily available.
In summary, our finding that pre-implantation embryos are permissive to SARSCoV-2 entry highlights a potential vulnerability of these embryos in vivo. Additionally, the
data presented here should prompt careful review of procedures surrounding in vitro
fertilization during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.
