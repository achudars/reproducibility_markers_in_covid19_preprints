Abstract

11

Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgency to identify novel

12

vaccine targets for protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with observations for

13

SARS-CoV, a closely related coronavirus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, early reports

14

identify a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated immunity for SARS CoV-2.

15

Methods: In this study, we leveraged HLA-I and HLA-II T cell epitope prediction tools from

16

RECON® (Real-time Epitope Computation for ONcology), our bioinformatic pipeline that was

17

developed using proteomic profiling of individual HLA-I and HLA-II alleles to predict rules for

18

peptide binding to a diverse set of such alleles. We applied these binding predictors to viral

19

genomes from the Coronaviridae family, and specifically to identify SARS-CoV-2 T cell

20

epitopes.

Results: To test the suitability of these tools to identify viral T cell epitopes, we first validated

2

HLA-I and HLA-II predictions on Coronaviridae family epitopes deposited in the Virus

3

Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) database. We then use our HLA-I and HLA-II

4

predictors to identify 11,776 HLA-I and 7,991 HLA-II candidate binding peptides across all 12

5

open reading frames (ORFs) of SARS-CoV-2. This extensive list of identified candidate peptides

6

is driven by the length of the ORFs and the significant number of HLA-I and HLA-II alleles that

7

we are able to predict (74 and 83, respectively), providing over 99% coverage for the US,

8

European and Asian populations, for both HLA-I and HLA-II. From our SARS-CoV-2 predicted

9

peptide-HLA-I allele pairs, 368 pairs identically matched previously reported pairs in the ViPR

10

database, originating from other forms of coronaviruses. 320 of these pairs (89.1%) had a

11

positive MHC-binding assay result. This analysis reinforces the validity our predictions.

12

Conclusions: Using this bioinformatic platform, we identify multiple putative epitopes for CD4+

13

and CD8+ T cells whose HLA binding properties cover nearly the entire population and thus may

14

be effective when included in prophylactic vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to induce broad

15

cellular immunity.

Background

2

Coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that have occasionally emerged

3

from zoonotic sources to infect human populations (1). Most of the infections cause mild

4

respiratory symptoms. However, some recent coronavirus infections have resulted in serious

5

morbidity and mortality, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-

6

CoV) (2–4), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (5,6) and SARS-CoV-

7

2, which is responsible for the current spreading of COVID-19. These three viruses all belong to

8

the genus Betacoronaviridae (1). SARS-CoV was identified in South China in 2002 and its

9

global spread led to 8096 cases and 774 deaths (7). The first case of MERS-CoV emerged in

10

2012 in Saudi Arabia, and since then a total of 2,494 cases and 858 associated deaths have been

11

reported (6). In contrast to the more limited scope of these other coronavirus infections, SARS-

12

CoV-2, which emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of December 2019, has resulted in 334,981

13

cases, including 14,652 deaths globally as of March 23, 2020 (8). The rapid spread of SARS-

14

CoV-2 has resulted in the World Health Organization declaring a global pandemic. Thus, there is

15

an urgent need for effective vaccines and antiviral treatments against SARS-CoV-2 to deal with

16

this global pandemic.

17

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 spans 30 kilobases in length and encodes for 12 open-reading

18

frames (ORFs), including four structural proteins. These structural proteins are the spike protein

19

(S), the membrane protein (M), the envelope protein (E), and the nucleocapsid protein (N). In

20

addition, there are over 20 non-structural proteins that account for all the proteins involved in the

21

transcription and replication of the virus (9). All encoded proteins of the virus are potential

22

candidates for developing vaccines to induce robust T cell immunity.

1

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share 76% amino acid identity across the genome (10,11). This

2

high degree of sequence similarity allows us to leverage the previous research on protective

3

immune responses to SAR-CoV to aid in vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2. Both humoral

4

and cellular immune responses have been shown to be important in host responses to SARS-CoV

5

(12). Antibody responses generated against the S and the N proteins have shown to protect from

6

SARS-CoV infection in mice and have been detected in SARS-CoV infected patients (13–16).

7

However, these antibody responses detected against the S protein were short-lived and

8

undetectable in patients six years post-recovery, suggesting that T cell responses may be

9

involved in the long-term control of this virus (17). Indeed, significant changes in the total

10

lymphocyte counts and T cell subset composition have been observed in patients with SARS-

11

CoV; namely, levels of both B cells, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been significantly reduced

12

in these patients (18,19). Similarly, mice infected with SARS-CoV demonstrated that the severity

13

of SARS correlated with the ability to develop a virus-specific T cell response (20,21).

14

Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses have been detected in SARS-CoV-infected patients

15

(12,22) as well as in SARS-CoV-2 (23). Notably, SARS-CoV-specific memory CD8+ T cells

16

persisted up to 11 years post-infection in patients who recovered from SARS (24). Studies in

17

mice have shown that SARS-CoV-specific memory CD8+ T cells provided protection against a

18

lethal SARS-CoV infection in aged mice (21). In addition, adoptive transfer of effector CD4+

19

and CD8+ T cells to immunodeficient or young mice expedited virus clearance and improved

20

clinical results (20). Immunization with SARS-CoV peptide-pulsed dendritic cells invigorated a

21

T cell response, increasing the number of virus-specific CD8+ T cells enhancing both virus

22

clearance and overall survival (25). These studies indicate an important role for T cell responses

23

in controlling disease severity, virus clearance and conferring protective immunity to SARS-CoV

infections. Given the homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as well as emerging

2

data on SARS-CoV-2 (23), cellular immune mechanisms might play a critical role in providing

3

protection against SARS-CoV-2.

4

Here, we used T cell epitope prediction tools from the bioinformatic pipeline RECON® (Real-

5

time Epitope Computation for ONcology) (26,27) to identify SARS-CoV-2 epitopes recognized

6

by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. RECON was trained on high-quality mono-allelic major

7

histocompatibility complex (MHC) immunopeptidome data generated via mass spectrometry.

8

The use of mass spectrometry allows for the high throughput, and relatively unbiased, collection

9

of MHC binding data compared to traditional binding affinity assays, as well as the inclusion of

10

important chaperone molecules. Additionally, the use of engineered mono-allelic cell lines

11

avoids dependence on in-silico deconvolution techniques and allows for allele coverage to be

12

expanded in a targeted manner.

13

With this approach, we generated data for 74 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I and 83 HLA-II

14

alleles (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). This mass spectrometry data enabled us to train neural

15

network-based binding predictors that outperform the leading affinity-based predictors for both

16

HLA-I (26) and HLA-II (27). Furthermore, we demonstrated in (27) that this improved binding

17

prediction leads to improved immunogenicity prediction by validating on a data set of tetramer

18

responses to a diverse collection of pathogens and allergens (28,29). Although RECON was

19

originally developed to prioritize neoantigens for immunotherapy applications, it is agnostic to

20

the source of peptide sequences evaluated and can be easily applied to peptides derived from

21

pathogens as well. As validation to that end, the binding predictors from RECON were used to

22

score Coronaviridae family peptides that had been assayed for T cell reactivity or MHC binding

23

from the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR) database (30). The ViPR database integrates viral

pathogen data from internally curated data, researcher submissions and data from various

2

external sources. Our approach provides a significant improvement in both the breadth of

3

predictions, and their validity, compared with a recent study that had a similar aim (31). We used

4

the HLA-I and HLA-II binding predictors from RECON to predict the binding potential of

5

peptide sequences from across the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome for a broad set of HLA-I and

6

HLA-II alleles, covering the vast majority of USA, European, and Asian populations

7

(Supplementary Table 3). Epitopes that were predicted to have a high likelihood of binding for

8

multiple alleles could potentially be included in vaccines to stimulate CD4+ and CD8+ immune

9

responses against this virus.

METHODS

11

Retrieval of Coronaviridae family T cell epitopes from ViPR

12

Experimentally determined epitopes for the Coronaviridae family for human hosts were

13

retrieved from the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR)

14

(https://www.viprbrc.org/; accessed March 5 2020) (30). To build a validation dataset, both

15

positives and negatives for T cell assays and MHC binding assays were obtained. Only assays

16

associated with alleles identified with at least four-digit resolution and supported by RECON

17

(Supplementary Table 1) were included for this analysis. Positive calls were prioritized – that is,

18

if a given peptide-allele pair was assayed multiple times by a specific assay type and was

19

determined to be positive in any single one of the assays, the peptide-allele pair was classified as

20

positive. Specifically, the priority was given by the following order: Positive-High > Positive-

21

Intermediate > Positive-Low > Positive > Negative (e.g., a peptide allele pairing that was

22

assayed three times with the results Positive-High, Positive, and Negative were assigned a

23

Positive-High result).

Binding prediction for ViPR Coronaviridae family T cell epitopes

3

Peptide-HLA-I allele pairs in the ViPR validation dataset were scored using RECON’s HLA-I

4

binding predictor , a neural network-based model trained on mass spectrometry data (26).

5

Similarly, peptide-HLA-II allele pairs in the ViPR validation dataset were scored using

6

RECON’s HLA-II binding predictor, a recently published convolutional neural network-based

7

model trained on mono-allelic mass spectrometry data (27). When applying the HLA-II binding

8

predictor, we used the highest score for all 12-20mers within a given assay peptide. This is meant

9

to account for the fact that the predictor is trained on ligands observed via mass spectrometry and

10

may learn processing rules that are irrelevant for assays that do not incorporate processing and

11

presentation.

12
13

Retrieval of SARS-CoV-2 sequence

14

The GenBank reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 (accession: NC_045512.2) was used for this

15

study. All twelve annotated open-reading frames (orf1a, orf1b, S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a,

16

ORF7b, ORF8, N, and ORF10) were considered as sources of potential epitopes.

17
18

Identification of HLA-I Epitopes

19

To identify candidate HLA-I epitopes, all possible 8-12mer peptide sequences from SARS-CoV-

20

2 were scored with RECON’s HLA-I binding predictor. The HLA-I binding predictor was used

21

to score SARS-CoV-2 peptides binding against 74 alleles, including 21 HLA-A alleles, 35 HLA7

1

B alleles, and 18 HLA-C alleles. Peptide-allele pairs were assigned a percent rank by comparing

2

their binding scores to those of 1,000,000 reference peptides for the same respective allele.

3

Peptide-allele pairs that scored in the top 1% of the scores of these reference peptides were

4

considered strong potential binders.

5

These top-ranking peptides were then prioritized based on expected USA population coverage

6

(allele frequencies obtained from (32) – USA frequencies calculated as follows:

7

0.623*EUR+0.133*AFA+0.068*APA+0.176*HIS), given all the alleles each peptide was

8

expected to bind to (i.e., all the alleles for which the peptide scored in the top 1%). The estimate

9

of population coverage for each peptide was calculated as

10

coverage = 1 – Πloci (1 – Σlocus alleles fallele,avg)2

11

where fallele,avg is the (unweighted) average allele frequency across the USA, European, and Asian

12

Pacific Islander (API) populations and the cumulative product is taken across the three HLA-I

13

loci: (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C).

14

The cumulative product itself represents the chance that an individual in the USA does not

15

express any one of the contained alleles; hence, the complement describes the probability that at

16

least one is present. The aim of using USA, European, and API allele frequencies is to cover a

17

diverse population where allele frequency estimates are relatively reliable.

18

We then construct two ranked lists of HLA-I epitopes by coverage. The first ranks the epitopes

19

by their absolute coverage, such that sequences predicted to bind similar collections of alleles

20

would be ranked similarly (Supplementary Table 4). The second list, referred to as the “disjoint”

21

list, is constructed in an iterative fashion where the sequence with the greatest coverage is

22

selected first, and then the coverage for the remaining epitopes is updated to nullify contributions

1

from any alleles that have already been selected (Supplementary Table 5). This second list was

2

used to generate Figure 3A.

3

Identification of HLA-II Epitopes

4

To identify HLA-II epitopes, we used RECON’s HLA-II binding predictor to score all 12-20mer

5

sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome to predict both binding potential and the likely binding

6

core within each 12-20mer. Scoring was performed across all supported HLA-II alleles that

7

comprise 46 HLA-DR alleles, 17 HLA-DP alleles, and 20 HLA-DQ alleles (Supplementary

8

Table 2).

9

Peptide/allele pairs were assigned a percent rank by comparing their binding scores to those of

10

100,000 reference peptides. Pairs scoring in the top 1% were deemed likely to bind.

11

Additionally, we define the “epitope” of a 12-20mer to be the predicted binding core within the

12

sequence. As such, overlapping 12-20mers with the same predicted binding core for a given

13

allele would constitute a single epitope. Table 1 shows counts of these epitopes.

14

Additionally, we generated two lists of 25mers contained in SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences

15

ranked by population coverage. To do this, we associated each 25mer with all subsequences that

16

were likely binders and calculated the population coverage of the corresponding HLA-II alleles.

17

Given a collection of alleles, we calculated the coverage as described in the previous section, the

18

only difference being the cumulative product is taken across the following four HLA-II loci:

19

HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB3/4/5, HLA-DP, and HLA-DQ. HLA-II allele frequencies were obtained

20

from (32) and Allele Frequency Net Database (33).

21

As with HLA-I, two sorted lists of predicted binding sequences were generated – one sorted on

22

absolute coverage (Supplementary Table 6), and one sorted on disjoint coverage (Supplementary

2

four 25mers to have predicted binders for >99.9% of the USA, European, and API populations.

Comparison of predicted epitopes to the human proteome

4

8-12mer sequences (corresponding to predicted HLA-I epitopes), 9mer sequences

5

(corresponding to predicted HLA-II binding cores), and 25mer sequences (corresponding to

6

predicted HLA-II sequences that bound multiple alleles) from SARS-CoV-2 were compared

7

against sub-sequences of the same length from the human proteome, using UCSC Genome

8

Browser genes with hg19 annotation of the human genome and its protein coding transcripts

9

(63,691 entries) (34). Exact matches were identified and flagged in Supplementary Table 4. No

10

exact matches were found for the predicted HLA-II binding cores or 25mer sequences.

RESULTS

13

Validating RECON prediction for viral epitopes using ViPR

14

We first sought to validate the ability of our predictors to identify epitopes from genomes of the

15

Coronaviridae family. Since SARS-CoV-2 only emerged recently, specific data on SARS-CoV-2

16

peptide MHC-binding and immunogenic epitopes are currently limited. However, other viruses

17

from the Coronaviridae family have been studied thoroughly, specifically MERS-CoV and SARS-

18

CoV. The latter has significant sequence homology to SARS-CoV-2 (35). We therefore sought to

19

leverage previously tested epitopes from across the Coronaviridae family to validate our

20

predictions of viral peptides, with special interest in peptide sequences that incidentally overlapped

21

the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. To that end, we used the publicly available ViPR database, which

22

lists the results of T cell immunogenicity and MHC peptide-binding assays for both HLA-I and
10

1

HLA-II alleles for viral pathogen epitopes. We used all assays of Coronaviridae family viruses

2

with human hosts from ViPR as our validation dataset. Assays that did not have an associated four-

3

digit HLA allele or were associated with an allele our models did not support were omitted (see

4

Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 for a list of supported alleles).

5

For HLA-I, within the validation dataset there were a total of 4,445 unique peptide-HLA allele

6

pairs that were assayed for MHC-binding, using variations of: 1) cellular MHC or purified MHC;

7

2) a direct or competitive assay; and 3) measured by fluorescence or radioactivity. Two additional

8

peptide-MHC allele pairs were confirmed via X-ray crystallography. Depending on the study from

9

which the data was collected, peptide-MHC allele pairs were either binarily defined in ViPR as

10

“Negative” and “Positive” for binding, or with a more granular scale of positivity: Low,

11

Intermediate, and High. We assigned peptide-MHC allele pairs with multiple measurements with

12

the highest MHC-binding detected across the replicates (see Methods).

13

We then applied our HLA-I binding predictor from RECON to the peptide-MHC allele pairs in

14

the validation dataset and compared the computed HLA-I percent ranks of these pairs with the

15

reported MHC-binding assay results (Supplementary Table 8). A low percent rank value

16

corresponds to high likelihood of binding (e.g., a peptide with a percent rank of 1% scores amongst

17

the top 1% of the reference peptides). The percent ranks of peptide-MHC allele pairs that had a

18

binary “Positive” result in the MHC-binding assay were significantly lower than pairs with a

19

“Negative” result. Further, in the more granular positive results, stronger assay results (low <

20

intermediate < high) were associated with increasingly lower percent ranks (Figure 1A). In

21

addition, the two peptide-MHC alleles that were confirmed by X-ray crystallography were

22

predicted as very likely binders, with low percent rank scores of 0.07% and 0.30%. These results

1

demonstrate that our HLA-I binding predictor from RECON can reliably predict the HLA-I

2

binding of peptides from proteins of the Coronaviridae family, to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs.

3

Assays of T cell reactivity (e.g., interferon-gamma ELISpots, tetramers), which are stricter

4

measures for T cell immunogenicity to epitopes, were performed in significantly lower numbers

5

compared with MHC-binding assays. For HLA-I, the overlap between peptide-MHC allele pairs

6

for which we had a prediction (supported alleles) and pairs with a reported T cell assay consisted

7

of only 32 pairs, of which 23 had a positive result. We did not detect differences in the percent

8

ranks across the positive and negative groups, however sample sizes are extremely small (data not

9

shown). In addition, for HLA-I epitopes, the validation dataset only contained T cell assay results

10

for peptide-MHC allele pairs that had a positive result in a binding assay, suggesting a biased pool

11

of epitopes selected for testing.

12

In addition to the identification of targets for CD8+ T cells, we have recently demonstrated and

13

incorporated into RECON the unprecedented ability to predict HLA-II binders (27), allowing us

14

to target CD4+ T cell responses which could be harnessed for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. These CD4+

15

responses can potentially bolster both T cell immunity and enhance humoral immunity (36).

16

In a similar fashion to the HLA-I analysis, we scored all Coronaviridae family peptide-MHC allele

17

pairs with supported HLA-II alleles in ViPR, using our HLA-II predictor (27) (Supplementary

18

Table 9). There were 259 unique peptide-MHC allele pairs assayed by MHC-binding assays in the

19

ViPR validation dataset for HLA-II. As before, we compared their percent rank with their reported

20

‘best’ (in the case of multiple measurements) MHC-binding assay result. This comparison could

21

not be performed with the “Negative” pairs as an independent group since there was only one

22

negative result in the validation dataset for HLA-II. The low negative counts may be due to under-

23

reporting of negative assay results or biased selection of the peptides to be assayed. Therefore, we

1

merged the “Negative” and “Positive-Low” groups into one group and compared their percent

2

ranks with either the “Positive-Intermediate” or the “Positive-High” groups (Figure 1B). This

3

analysis revealed a trend similar to that observed with HLA-I predictions, indicating that stronger

4

MHC-binding assay results are associated with a lower predicted percent rank for HLA-II binders,

5

as we expect for a robust predictor. Similar to the HLA-I T cell assays, there were too few recorded

6

HLA-II T cell assays (31) in our validation dataset to determine percent rank differences between

7

peptide-HLA II allele pairs testing positive and negative. Together, these findings further

8

corroborate the validity of our epitope predictors, as peptide-MHC allele pairs with positive results

9

in binding assays consistently have lower percent ranks (better scores) by both our HLA-I and

10

HLA-II MHC-binding predictors.

11
12

Epitope Prediction for SARS-CoV-2

13

We harnessed RECON’s HLA binding prediction ability to identify the peptides most relevant to

14

the generation of SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses. We first performed the analysis for HLA-I

15

peptide binding; we computed the likelihood of each peptide of lengths 8-12 amino-acid from the

16

12 SARS-CoV-2 ORFs to bind to any HLA-I allele in our database was computed. We then

17

calculated the percent rank of each peptide-MHC allele pair by comparing their binding scores to

18

those of a set of reference peptides, to generate a list of best-ranking peptide-MHC allele pairs

19

(Figure 2A-C).

20
21

We detected a total of 11,776 unique SARS-CoV-2 peptides that were predicted to bind at least

22

peptides overlapped with a subsequence of the human proteome (see methods, Supplementary

2

Table 4).

3

Unlike HLA-I, which has a closed binding groove that constrains bound peptide lengths to

4

approximately 8 to 12 amino acids, peptides binding HLA-II have a wider length distribution (up

5

to 30 amino acids or even longer) since the HLA-II binding groove is open at both ends. Peptides

6

bind with a 9 amino acid subsequence (termed the binding core) occupying the HLA-II binding

7

groove, with any flanking sequence overhanging the edges of the molecule. We consider a group

8

of peptides that differ in the flanking regions but share a common binding core as a single epitope.

9

Using the HLA-II predictor we identified 7,207 unique binding-cores that are predicted to bind at

10

least one HLA-II allele with a percent rank score of 1% or lower. The number of high-quality

11

peptide-MHC allele pairs we identify per SARS-CoV-2 gene is listed in Table 1. The majority of

12

predicted peptide-MHC allele pairs are from orf1a and orf1ab, primarily driven by the length of

13

these ORFs. In addition, orf1a and orf1ab have very similar sequences, with over 18,000 identical

14

binding peptide-HLA-I allele pairs predicted for both ORFs. We therefore opted to exclude

15

redundant predictions and only reported unique pairs (see * in Table 1). Similarly, all HLA-II

16

predicted epitopes from orf1a were covered by those reported for orf1ab.

17

To test the validity of the SARS-CoV-2 predicted peptide-HLA pairs, we looked for identical

18

peptide sequences in the Coronaviridae portion of the ViPR database (Figure 2D). A total of 368

19

HLA-I peptide-MHC allele pairs from SARS-CoV-2 had both a percent rank lower than 1% by

20

our predictor and were found in the HLA-I MHC-binding validation dataset. Strikingly, of these

21

HLA-I peptide-MHC allele pairs, 328 (89.1%) had a positive assay result. As a comparison, we

22

also tested for overlap between epitopes predicted to have low likelihood of MHC-binding (percent

23

rank 50% or higher) and the validation dataset. 37 peptide-MHC allele pairs overlapped between

1

these sets, of which 36 (97.2%) had a negative assay result, as predicted. Further, we sought to

2

determine whether our highly predicted SARS-CoV-2 peptide-HLA-I allele pairs (percent rank

3

lower than 1%) would be validated by reported T cell assay results. Despite the significantly

4

smaller number of peptide-MHC allele pairs that were tested for T cell reactivity in the validation

5

dataset, 10 assayed pairs were also highly predicted by our HLA-I binding predictor. Nine out of

6

these 10 (90%) predicted pairs had a positive result to the T cell assay. No low-scoring pairs

7

(percent rank of 50% or above) were reported in the validation dataset. These findings demonstrate

8

the validity of our prediction for peptide-HLA-I allele pairs for SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Notably,

9

while our algorithms are not trained on T cell reactivity data, and are aimed at peptide-MHC

10

binding, for the few examples for which we had T cell reactivity assay results, we were able to

11

show our highly-scoring peptide-MHC allele pairs are indeed immunogenic in the vast majority

12

of cases.

13

For HLA-II peptide-MHC allele pairs, only a single HLA-II peptide-MHC allele pair had both a

14

percent rank lower than 1% and was reported in the validation dataset; this single pair (from the

15

envelope protein) had a “Positive-High” assay result.

A small number of peptides predicted to bind multiple HLA-I and HLA-II alleles can provide

2

broad population coverage

3

The concordance between the validation dataset and our highly predicted peptide-MHC allele pairs

4

indicate that the HLA binding predictors from RECON significantly expand the list of predicted

5

MHC binding peptides from the ORFs of SARS-CoV-2. We then sought to estimate the minimal

6

number of HLA-I and HLA-II epitopes that would be required to provide coverage for the USA,

7

European and Asian Pacific Islander populations based on the prevalence of MHC alleles in these

8

populations (32). We found that a subset of the peptides was predicted to bind a broad set of either

9

HLA-I or HLA-II alleles. We determined that a vaccine containing three of these HLA-I and four

10

HLA-II sequences could provide >99.9% coverage for all of the USA, European, and Asian Pacific

11

Islander populations, for HLA-I and HLA-II, respectively (Figure 3). Under the assumption that

12

all peptide-MHC allele pairs for which a given peptide scores in the top 1% are indeed

13

immunogenic, this finding could facilitate the design of a parsimonious, broadly effective vaccine.

14
15

Discussion

16

In this work, we demonstrated the utility and validity of our HLA-I and HLA-II binding

17

prediction algorithms to the Coronaviridae virus family, and specifically to SARS-CoV-2. By

18

applying these algorithms to previously assayed peptide-MHC allele pairs in ViPR, we were able

19

to show excellent concordance between our binding predictions and the results of the assays for

20

both HLA-I and HLA-II epitopes. We leveraged the homology within the Coronaviridae family

21

to demonstrate that an exceedingly high portion (~90%) of our high-ranking SARS-CoV-2

22

peptide-MHC allele pairs for which validation was available was indeed confirmed to bind the

23

predicted MHC allele. Likewise, lowly-scoring peptide-MHC allele pairs derived from SARS-

1

CoV-2 that had previously been assayed in ViPR were confirmed as non-binding. We therefore

2

concluded that using RECON’s HLA binding predictors to predict T cell epitopes from the ORFs

3

of SARS-CoV-2 provides a significantly expanded, novel set of high-quality vaccine targets for

4

the virus. These sequences can be exploited for vaccines in various formats, including RNA or

5

peptides.

6
7

This application of our prediction algorithms has clearly identified many candidate epitopes that

8

can be included in a vaccine to induce cellular responses against this novel virus. Immune

9

analysis of patients infected with either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV has identified critical

10

antiviral roles for these cellular responses. Viral specific CD8+ T cells can be cytotoxic and can

11

kill virally infected cells to reduce disease severity. CD8+ T cells account for about 80% of the

12

total inflammatory cells in the pulmonary interstitium of SARS-CoV infected patients and play a

13

vital role in eliminating virally infected cells (12). In addition to having effector functions, CD4+

14

T cells can promote the production of virus-specific antibodies by activating T-dependent B

15

cells. With respect to humoral immunity, antibodies are seen primarily to the S and N proteins.

16

Although short lived, antibody responses are essential to control the persistent phase of CoV

17

infection by preventing subsequent viral entry. We thus propose that a combination of B and T

18

cell epitopes could provide long-lasting immunity from SARS-CoV-2 or mitigate the severity of

19

disease when protection is partial.

20

The strength of our prediction is two-fold: first, we have validated predictors for both HLA-I and

21

HLA-II binders, which potentially could be leveraged to induce both long-term CD4+ and CD8+

22

T cell immunity against the virus. Specifically, our HLA-II predictor, which has also been

23

trained on a large set of mono-allelic mass spectrometry data, has been shown to significantly

1

outperform previously published tools and is used here to identify high-quality CD4+ epitopes

2

that may contribute to both cellular and humoral immunity (27) (Supplementary Table 6).

3

Second, our expansive database of supported HLA-I and HLA-II alleles provides us with the

4

ability to not only identify many peptide-MHC allele pairs, but to generate a narrow list of

5

peptides with many potential HLA pairings that could be presented by the entire USA, European

6

and Asian Pacific Islander populations. These advantages significantly improve upon previously

7

published findings (31).

8

Our algorithms predict peptide-MHC binding, which is necessary but not sufficient to induce a T

9

cell response. Therefore, further experimental work would be needed to refine the list of peptides

10

to strictly immunogenic ones. However, with the breadth of the list we are able to provide, the

11

likelihood of identifying many such epitopes is high. In addition, while the availability of

12

confirmed T cell reactions to SARS2-CoV-2 epitopes is limited, nine out of 10 highly ranking

13

peptide-HLA-I allele pairs that were previously assayed had a positive result in a T cell assay.

14
15

Conclusions

16

In summary, our work provides the most robust set of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells epitopes that

17

are spanning the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome and binding a wide set of HLA-I and HLA-II

18

alleles. Our predicted list of T cell epitopes serves as a resource for the scientific community to

19

generate potent SARS-CoV-2 vaccine epitopes and generate long-lasting T cell immunity. These

20

epitopes are predicted to bind MHC alleles covering over 99.9% of the USA, European and

21

Asian Pacific Islander populations and could complement B cell epitopes that have been shown

22

to be effective but provide short-lived immunity. This expansive data set allows us to identify

African American (AFA), and Hispanic (HIS) populations. The USA population allele frequency

11

is calculated as the following weighted average:

12

0.623*EUR+0.133*AFA+0.068*APA+0.176*HIS. For alleles where AFA and API population
