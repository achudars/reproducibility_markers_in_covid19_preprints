Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a common human receptor ACE2.
Protein-protein interaction structure modeling indicates that spike-RBD of the two
viruses also has similar overall binding conformation and binding free energy to
ACE2. In vitro assays using recombinant ACE2 proteins and ACE2 expressing cells
confirmed the two coronaviruses’ similar binding affinities to ACE2. The above
studies provide experimental supporting evidences and possible explanation for the
high transmissibility observed in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Potent ACE2-blocking
SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies showed limited cross-binding and neutralizing
activities to SARS-CoV-2. ACE2-non-blocking SARS-CoV RBD antibodies, though
with weaker neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV, showed positive
cross-neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2 with an unknown mechanism. These
findings suggest a trade-off between the efficacy and spectrum for therapeutic
antibodies to different coronaviruses, and hence highlight the possibilities and
challenges in developing broadly protecting antibodies and vaccines against
SARS-CoV-2 and its future mutants.

Introduction
In December 2019, outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection has brought back the attention
of pathogenic coronavirus to the spotlight1-5. SARS-CoV-2 is spreading rapidly,
causing severe COVID-19 symptoms and life-threatening diseases in some infected
patients6. Numbers of infected cases reached over 60,000 in less than 3 months7.

Various estimates and analyses suggest SARS-CoV-2 and Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) may have similar transmissibility with an
estimated reproductive number (R0) of 3.77 (2.23-4.82) for SARS-CoV-2 and between
2.9-3.3 for SARS-CoV8.
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a common host-cell receptor protein, angiotensin
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), expressed on epithelial cells in the respiratory track
system and various human organs, such as the lung9,10. Receptor recognition by
coronaviruses is the first and essential step for infecting host cells11,12. An
envelope-anchored trimeric spike (S) protein mediates the binding of the two
coronaviruses to human ACE213,14, and is cleaved by the host protease into two
separate polypeptides as S1, which contains the receptor binding domain (RBD), and
S2, which is responsible for the homotrimer formation and mediates fusion of the
virion with cellular membranes15. The receptor binding motif (RBM) in RBD is
responsible for direct binding to ACE2 and its binding affinity may directly affects the
virus infectivity and transmissibility16,17. The amino acid sequence homology between
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 approximates to 75% for the spike proteins, and are
73.7% and 50.0% for RBDs and RBMs, respectively.
The prominent sequence differences between the crucial RBMs of SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV raise a critical question of whether the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2
spike protein to human ACE2 is comparable to that of SARS-CoV. A recent study by
computational modeling suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has a lower binding affinity to
human ACE2, as a result of the loss of one hydrogen bond interactions18. However,
another publication using structure analysis suggested similar binding affinities to
SARS-CoV9. By using biolayer interferometry binding assay, Tian et al.9 measured
the SARS-CoV-2 RBD’s binding affinity to human ACE2 protein to be 15.2 nM,
which is comparable to previously published affinity data for SARS-CoV spike
protein19. The above comparison of spike proteins’ binding affinities to human ACE2
between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were inconclusive or indirect, hence, a direct
head-to-head comparison is desired for the understanding of the infectivity and
transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Neutralizing antibody (nAb) is expected to be one of the most promising treatments
against coronavirus infection among the existing therapeutic options20,21. Several
nAbs targeting SARS-CoV exhibit significant in vivo antivirus activities by reducing
virus titers in lung tissues of animal models22-26. However, coronavirus is a
single-stranded RNA virus prone to rapid mutations during transmission, nAbs
without cross-reactivity to a broad spectrum of viral mutants could lead to treatment
failure10,27-29, therefore, highly potent and cross-protective nAbs and prophylactic
vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are in urgent needs.
Here we investigated the optimized complex structure conformations between the
RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019, GISAID accession ID:
EPI_ISL_402119) and SARS-CoV (CUHK-W1, GenBank accession ID: AY278554)

with ACE2 by computational modeling and binding free energy analysis. We also
used the recombinant S1 proteins of the two viruses to compare their binding curves
to both recombinant ACE2 protein and ACE2 expressing cells. The above studies
confirm that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have similar binding affinities to the
human receptor ACE2.
Due to the relatively low homology of the spike RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV, it is of significant interest to investigate whether SARS-CoV neutralizing
antibodies possess cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV polyclonal antibodies
and ACE2 blocking and non-blocking nAbs were tested with SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus (PSV) for cross neutralizing activities.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex structure modeling reveals almost identical
structure configuration and affinity to SARS-CoV
The structure model for SARS-CoVRBD-ACE2 complex was optimized based on the
complex’s crystal structure (PDB ID: 2AJF) (http://www.rcsb.org/). The structure
model for SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex was constructed by homology
modeling using the optimized SARS-CoV RBD-ACE2 complex crystal structure as a
template, based on a 73.7% amino acid sequence homology between the two viruses.
Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of Cα atoms between the two complex
structures is 0.703 Å, indicating an almost identical structural conformation
(Figure1B). There are subtle differences in the RBD-ACE2 interfaces between
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at the loop 469-470 (numbered according to
SARS-CoV RBD), arising from a one-residue insertion after residue 469 (Figure 1A).
On the other hand, the interaction patterns in both complex structures’ interfaces are
somewhat different (Figure 1A and Table S2). Four residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD
(i.e. N439, G476, Q498, and N501) lost their interactions with ACE2 as compared
with the corresponding residues in SARS-CoV RBD (i.e. R426, D463, Y484, and
T487), four replacing residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD (i.e. K417, V445, E484, and
F486) form new interactions with ACE2, which are absent in the SARS-CoV RBD
(corresponding to V404, S432, P470, and L472) (Figure 1A&C). It is noteworthy that
although a strong salt-bridge presented between R426 of SARS-CoV RBD and E329
of ACE2, is missing in the interaction involving SARS-CoV-2 RBD. However, a new
strong salt-bridge interaction between E484 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and K31 of ACE2
compensates for that loss.
The RBD-ACE2 binding free energies of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are estimated
to be -40.42 and -44.96 REU (Rosetta energy unit), respectively (Table S1), by
Rosetta Interface Analyzer30. The insignificant difference in binding free energies
suggests that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV viruses have similar binding affinities to
human ACE2.

Recombinant S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 showed similar binding to human ACE2
in both protein and cellular forms, as compared with SARS-CoV
The RBD containing S1 protein, resulted from cleavage of the spike protein on the
virus membrane is responsible for the binding of the virus to human receptor on cell
membrane, which is important for viral infectivity31. Binding curves of recombinant
S1 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV to human ACE2 were measured by
ELISA. Results confirmed that both viruses have similar S1-ACE2 protein-protein
binding curves and EC50 (Figure 2A). Binding curves of S1 protein to ACE2
expressing 293T cells was further assessed using FACS. Again, similar binding curves
and EC50 values were obtained for the two viruses (Figure 2B). The above
experimental results are consistent with our structure modeling analysis, which
indicates that SARS-CoV-2 virus likely infects human cells through similar
mechanisms as SARS-CoV virus by binding to human ACE2 with comparable
affinities, and hence may possess similar transmissibility.

pseudovirus neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2
Coronavirus’ mutation and emergence of escape mutants to neutralizing monoclonal
antibodies and vaccines are a major concern. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are two
different coronaviruses with modest level of sequence homology in their spike
proteins. Understanding whether antibodies raised from SARS-CoV spike protein
immunization have cross-reactivity to the new SARS-CoV-2 will offer important
insights and guidance to therapeutic antibody and prophylactic vaccine development.
SARS-CoV nAbs were generated by immunizing mouse or rabbit with SARS-CoV S1
or RBD protein. Two SARS-CoV S-protein rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Table 1) and
four monoclonal antibodies (Table 2) were analyzed for cross-reactivity to
SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein and cross-neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2 PSV. As
expected, the polyclonal antibodies showed weaker binding to SARS-CoV-2 S1
protein (EC50>100ng/mL) as compared to SARS-CoV S1 protein (EC50<25ng/mL).
Neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 PSV were lower by more than two-orders
of magnitudes than SARS-CoV PSV (Table 1), presenting a pessimistic forecast for
the probability to identify highly potent and cross-reactive nAbs to SARS-CoV-2 from
SARS-CoV antibodies or antibody libraries.
SARS-CoV monoclonal nAbs with strong S1 binding (EC50<50ng/mL, KD≤2.0E-10
M) and potent ACE2-blocking activities exhibited potent neutralizing activities
against SARS-CoV (minimum dose to reach 100% neutralization at ~0.1μg/mL), but
almost no cross-binding to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein (EC50>15μg/mL) and no
cross-neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 PSV (<50% neutralizing activity at
100μg/mL) (Figure3, Table 2, Figure S1 & S2).
Interestingly, three ACE2-non-blocking monoclonal antibodies showed modest
binding activities to SARS-CoV S1 protein (EC50>100ng/mL) and neutralizing
activities to the SARS-CoV PSV (minimum dose to reach 100% neutralization at ≥
10 μg/mL). Although, these nAbs were less potent than the ACE2-blocking nAbs to
SARS-CoV, but could evidently cross-bind to the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein
(EC50<3μg/mL) and cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 PSV (>50% neutralizing activity
at 100μg/mL) (Table 2).

Significant micro-structure differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
RBDs exist in their RBM regions
As suggested by the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD sequence alignment analysis
(Figure 1A), the 50% RBM sequence homology is much less than the 73.7% RBD
sequence homology. Structure similarity analysis confirms the presence of significant
local structure differences in the RBM regions, while the rest of the RBD regions have
significantly higher similarities (Figure 4). Moreover, three glycosylation sites in
SARS-CoV RBD (i.e. N318, N330, and N357)32 was conserved, although one of the
glycosylation sites, N357, may not be glycosylated in the corresponding residue of
SARS-CoV-2 as predicted by NetNGlyc33.
Taking the two viruses’ RBD structure similarities and glycosylation sites into account,
we predict that there are two possible conserved regions in RBD where epitopes for
cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies reside. These regions probably do not overlap
with the ACE2 binding sites (Figure 4). We speculate that it is more likely to obtain
cross-reactive and non-blocking neutralizing antibodies targeting the conserved
regions outside the RBM region. The neutralization mechanism for these
non-blocking but cross-reactive antibodies is likely unrelated to ACE2 blockage.

Figure 4. Structure similarity between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD.
RBD is shown in a space-filled model with colored surface. ACE2 is shown as gray tube model.
The three glycosylation sites in SARS-CoV are labeled. Note that N357ST in SARS-CoV is
changed to N370SA in SARS-CoV-2, which is different from the NXS/T pattern required for
glycosylation, and hence this site is more likely to be unglycosylated. The two possible
cross-reactive regions are marked with yellow circles.

cell receptors to initiate infection. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV viruses use
human ACE2 for cell entry10. Due to the nature of RNA virus’ rapid mutation rates,
changes in the S-protein’s amino acid sequence, especially in the RBD’s receptor
binding motif, could have significant impact on virus infectivity, pathogenicity,
transmissibility, and cross-protection from previous coronavirus infection, as well as
therapeutic antibody and prophylactic vaccine development. Hence, understanding the
differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and their implications may offer
significant scientific and practical value.
Though it is difficult to assess the virus-host-cell interactions with real virion, we
studied the new SARS-CoV-2 in head-to-head comparisons with SARS-CoV using
multiple methods. Measurements of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike
proteins to recombinant ACE2 protein and ACE2 expressing 293T cells confirmed the
two coronaviruses’ similar binding affinities to human ACE2 (Figure 2A&B), which
provided direct molecular based evidences to support and possibly explain the
observation that the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has similar transmissibility to
SARS-CoV virus.
Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are both coronaviruses with over 70% sequence
homology and share the same human receptor ACE2, analyzing SARS-CoV’s
antibodies’ cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 may provide useful information on
whether neutralizing epitopes were conserved on the two coronaviruses. Two rabbit
polyclonal antibodies produced with SARS-CoV S1 and RBD proteins had potent
binding and neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV but only modest cross-binding and
cross-neutralizing activities to the new SARS-CoV-2 virus. Four highly potent ACE2
blocking SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies showed binding affinities to SARS-CoV
S1 protein in the range of 0.2 nM to 8.7 pM, and very high neutralizing activities to
SARS-CoV. As low as 0.2 ug/mL nAb can lead to 100% neutralization of SARS-CoV
PSV. However, virtually no cross-binding or cross neutralizing activities against the
novel SARS-CoV-2 virus were detected with the four ACE2 blocking monoclonal
antibodies.
We then screened non-ACE2-blocking antibodies raised from SARS-CoV RBD for
neutralizing activities. Three such monoclonal antibodies were identified. Although,
binding affinities to SARS-CoV S1 protein was significantly lower with EC50
between 55 to 224 μg/mL as compared to 16 to 42 μg/mL EC50 for the four
ACE2-blocking nAbs, significant cross-binding activities to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein
and modest cross-neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 PSV were detected.
The observation that these three antibodies bind to and neutralize both SARS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2 without blocking ACE2 suggest the following. First, the epitope or
epitopes for these three antibodies are conserved across the two significantly different
coronaviruses. Hence it is possible but maybe challenging to identify antibodies with
potent neutralizing activities to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and ideally to
their mutant virus strains as well. Second, the epitope or epitopes for the three nAbs

are likely located outside the RBM motif due to their non-ACE2 blocking features and
the fact that homology in the RBM motif between the two viruses is significantly
lower than the rest portion of the RBD.
An analysis on the mutations in RBD was also conducted. We analyzed 68 sequences
of SARS-CoV-2 variants in GISAID and found 4 variants with mutations in RBD
(one has N354D/D364Y, two have V367F, and one has F342L). Alignment of 111
SARS-CoV RBD sequences, collected by BLAST via NCBI website34, was used for
ConSurf analysis35. As shown in Figure 5, the SARS-CoV RBM region is highly
variable, making it more challenging to develop cross-reactive antibodies with broad
spectrum of neutralizing activities against mutant strains. On the other hand,
significant portions of RBD (marked in pink) outside the RBM motif are highly
conserved. Neutralizing antibodies targeting epitopes in these regions could
potentially have cross-protective activities against different mutant strains.
It is also noteworthy that the three non-blocking antibodies’ neutralizing activities are
significantly lower than the four blocking antibodies. Due to the limited number of
antibodies obtained, it is difficult to conclude whether there is a consistent pattern
between ACE2 blockage and neutralizing potency, but one can speculate that
neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved epitopes outside the RBM region may be
cross-protective but may also be less potent due to the lack of ACE2 blocking
activities. In a recent article9, a SARS-CoV RBD neutralizing antibody CR3022 with
an epitope outside the RBM motif was also shown to be non-blocking but
cross-binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with a relatively low KD of 6.3 nM.
The neutralization mechanism of these non-blocking antibodies is not clear yet. It is
known that antibodies targeting the S2 region could block S2 protein’s configuration
change and hence interfere with virus entry into host cells. Whether these
non-blocking RBD antibodies also interfere with S2 protein’s configuration change
remains to be investigated.
In summary, the above findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind to
human ACE2 with similar affinities and hence may have similar transmissibility.
Antibodies targeting the RBM regions may be more potent due to their ACE2
blocking activities but cross-protecting antibodies targeting the RBM regions may be
more difficult to obtain because of the lower degree of sequence conservation.
Antibodies to the more conserved regions outside the RBM motif may possess
cross-protective neutralizing activities but may be less potent due to the lack of ACE2
blocking activities. Mechanism of neutralization for the non-blocking RBD antibodies
remains to be investigated. Developing potent and cross-protective therapeutic
antibodies and vaccines is possible but could be challenging.

labeling were added and incubated for another hour before washed away. Developing
buffer was added and incubated for 5-30 min, 1% H2SO4was added to stop the reaction
and absorbance at 450nm was detected with a microplate reader.
Flow cytometry
Indicated concentrations of S1 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were
incubated with 293T-ACE2 cells for 45 min. After washing away the unbound proteins,
cells were incubated withPE labelled anti-his-tag antibody for 20 min and went through
flow cytometer for detection of cellular binding. Flowjo and Graphpad softwares were
used for data analysis.
Octet
Recombinant SARS-CoV S1 protein were biotinated and loaded using SA sensor,
indicated antibodies were added for real time association and dissociation analysis.
Data Analysis Octet was used for data processing.
Pseudovirus production in 293T adherent cells
6-8 hours before transfection, 293T cells were pre-plate on T75 flask in DMEM+10%
FBS at 100,000 cells/cm2. 13μg of Luciferase-expressing HIV-1 lentiviral transfer
genome (pWPXL-luc), 13μg of packaging plasmid (PSD) and 13μg of expression
plasmid encoding either SARS-CoV-2-S protein (pCMV-whCoV-Spike) or SARS-S
protein (pCMV-SARS-Spike) were co-transfected into pre-plated 293T cells using
Sinofection transfection reagent according to the procedure recommended by
manufacturer. Then the transfected cells incubated were incubated at 37℃ and 5% CO2
overnight, followed by medium exchange with fresh DMEM plus 10% FBS. The
supernatant containing pseudovirus was collected after 48-72 hours and filtered
through a 0.45μm filter and stored at -80℃ for longtime storage or 4℃ for short time
storage.
Pseudovirus neutralization assay
293T-ACE2 cells were plated in 96-well plate at 1,0000 cells/well in 100 μ L
DMEM+10% FBS. 60μL serially diluted antibody samples and 60μL of SARS-CoV-2
or SARS PSV were mixed and incubated at 4℃ for 1 hour. Then 100μL/well of the
antibody-PSV mixture was added onto the 293T/ACE2 cell wells and incubated for

neutralization titers were presented as 50% maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50).
Sequence alignment
Protein sequence alignments were performed using Clustal Omega36.
RBD-ACE2 complex structure modeling and analysis
The SARS-CoV RBD-ACE2 complex structure was remodeled based on PDB 2AJF to
complete its missing loop using Discovery Studio (DS)37. This complex structure was
then optimized by Rosetta Relax38. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex structure
was constructed base on the optimized SARS-CoV RBD-ACE2 complex structure
using DS and was also optimized by Rosetta Relax. The interface between the RBD and
ACE2 was analyzed by Rosetta Interface Analyzer30 and DS. Software PyMol was
used for preparing structural figures39. Structural similarity analysis between
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV was carried out by Discovery Studio (DS)37.
Structural conservation analysis of SARS-CoV RBD
Structural conservation analysis of SARS-CoV RBD was carried out using ConSurf35.
Alignment of 111 SARS-CoV RBD sequence, used for the generation of sequence
conservation, was collected by BLAST via NCBI website34. Structural conservation
was displayed by PyMol39.
