Summary
The human placenta is increasingly a focus of research related to early child development and
the impact of maternal hyperimmune states. The ability to model human trophectoderm disease
states from human pluripotent stem cells, the nature of human pluripotent stem cell potency and
the mechanisms regulating human trophectoderm specification remains poorly understood.
Recent work suggests that only the naive state can give rise to trophectoderm and that primed
iPSC generate mixed amnionic and mesoderm lineages. Here we identify conditions that
efficiently drive the specification of primed iPSC to trophectoderm, named Trophoblast Stem
Cell (TSC). iPS-derived-TSC share transcriptional, morphological and functional characteristics
with human in vivo cytotrophoblasts including activation of human endogenous retroviruses,
expression of COVID-19 associated host factors and generation of multinucleated
syncytiotrophoblasts with a large fusion index. At high densities in 5% O2, iPS-derived-TSC form
villi-like structures and express extravillous and syncytiotrophoblast proteins HCG-β and HLA-G.
Using temporal single cell RNAseq, we define the molecular changes associated with
specification under three separate conditions: 1) BMP4, 2) BMP4 and inhibition of WNT, 3)
activation of EGF and WNT, inhibition of TGFbeta, HDAC and ROCK signaling (named TSC).
With 9,821 high-quality single cell transcriptomes, we find that BMP4 gives rise to mesenchymal
cells while TS conditions lacking exogenous BMP4 generate a stable proliferating cell type that
is highly similar to six week placenta cytotrophoblasts. TFAP2A programs the specification of
primed iPS cells to TSC without transitioning through a naive state. TSC specification
independent of exogenous BMP4 will allow for robust and reproducible studies of the
cytotrophoblast component of human placenta.
Introduction
The first cellular specification occurs early in human development when blastomeres divide
asymmetrically to generate the outer trophectoderm and the inner cell mass of the preimplantation embryo. Upon implantation, primitive syncytial trophoblast invades and remodels
the maternal decidual environment before specifying into the cytotrophoblast and
syncytiotrophoblast layers found in placenta villi. Currently, there is a limited understanding of
the early developmental trajectories of human trophoblast differentiations (Rossant, 2018).
Human models are essential to understanding how the human placenta is built. Placental
structures and interaction of placental cells with the maternal environment vary tremendously
across mammals. Comparative genome analysis demonstrates that genes involved in placenta
and reproduction are amongst the most divergent between human and mouse (Mouse Genome
Sequencing Consortium et al., 2002). The evolutionary tinkering between species is driven by
endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) ((Johnson, 2019)). Now comprising 8% of the human genome,
human endogenous retroviruses are retroviruses acquired by ancestral humans which then
integrate into the genome and are passed onto the next generation (Lander et al., 2001). ERVderived proteins have been repeatedly co-opted for placental functions to promote cell–cell
fusion and formation of syncytial trophoblast by endogenous retrovirus group W member 1
(ERVWE1 or syncytin-1) (Blond et al., 1999, 2000; Cornelis et al., 2013) and ERVFRD-1 (Blaise
et al., 2003). ERVs harbor regulatory sequences that function as enhancers to control placental

gene expression, such as a primate-specific ERV which functions as a placenta-specific
enhancer for corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a hormone linked to the control of birth
timing in humans (Blond et al., 2000; Dunn-Fletcher et al., 2018). Therefore, human cellular
systems are crucial to understand the many human and primate-specific properties of human
placenta.
Human induced pluripotent stem cells are powerful models to understand causal genetic
mechanisms of human disease. For organs such as the brain, rapid progress has led to iPS
models with increasing complexity and utility (Mansour et al., 2020). For the human placenta,
which is increasingly implicated as a risk factor for developmental disorders associated with a
maternal hyperimmune state, the ability to faithfully model human trophectoderm disease states
from human pluripotent stem cells is a matter of debate. Several model systems have been
developed to differentiate primed and naive iPSC to trophectoderm. Soon after the derivation of
the first human stem cells, Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) was shown to differentiate
human stem cells to syncytial cytotrophoblasts (Xu et al., 2002). Since then, various BMP4based methods have been described including the BAP protocol (BMP4, A83-01 an alk-5
inhibitor and PD173074 and FGF and VEGF inhibitor)(Roberts et al., 2018) and a combination
of BMP4 and IWP2 (Horii et al., 2019) , an inhibitor that blocks the biosynthesis of mature WNT
proteins (Chen et al., 2009). Primed iPS differentiations have almost exclusively included the
use of BMP4, despite the fact that single cell sequencing of the peri-implantation human embryo
found the BMP signaling pathway and SMAD protein signal transduction to be enriched in
primitive endoderm, not trophectoderm (Blakeley et al., 2015; Petropoulos et al., 2016; Stirparo
et al., 2018). BMP4 induces differentiation of mesendoderm of the embryo proper (Goldman et
al., 2009; Schneider et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008) and also extraembryonic
endoderm (Vallier et al., 2009) in addition to upregulating some genes expressed in
trophoblasts. TB differentiations using these model systems generate heterogeneous cells with
mesodermal contamination and fail to maintain a trophoblast stem cell population (Bernardo et
al., 2011; Drukker et al., 2012; Erb et al., 2011; Yabe et al., 2016). Models inconsistently
manipulate morphogens including BMP and WNT to generate trophoblast-like cells that are
characterized with a limited set of genes. Recent single cell analyses of the early placenta have
characterized the expression of these genes in multiple placental cell types (Liu et al., 2018;
Suryawanshi et al., 2018; Vento-Tormo et al., 2018). As many of these genes are either
expressed in many different cell types or not detected at all, their findings call into question the
confidence with which specific iPS derived placental cell types can be identified. Therefore, it is
a matter of debate which pluripotent states can give rise to trophectoderm and how similar these
trophectoderm cells are to in vivo placenta.
Understanding if and how induced pluripotent stem cells can generate human trophectoderm is
central to understanding human pluripotent stem cell potency and the mechanisms regulating
human trophectoderm specification. In the present study, we first ask if BMP4 is required for
primed pluripotent stem cell specification to trophectoderm. In the absence of BMP4, we find
that activation of wingless/Integrated (Wnt) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) while inhibiting
Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFb) histone deacetylase (HDAC) and Rho-associated
protein kinase (ROCK) efficiently specify multiple primed pluripotent stem cell lines to

trophectoderm. These factors were previously discovered to derive and grow trophoblast stem
cells from blastocysts and the early placenta (Okae et al., 2018). We demonstrate that iPSderived TS cells are capable of self-renewal for at least 30 passages, differentiate into syncytial
cytotrophoblasts and villus cytotrophoblasts and generate villi-like structures in low oxygen. We
used temporal single-cell sequencing analysis to elucidate the transcriptional landscape of this
specification compared to previously implemented protocols involving BMP4. We find that BMP4
conditions alone largely generate extraembryonic mesoderm cells. BMP4 combined with
inhibition of WNT shifts differentiation away from a mesodermal fate while upregulating
trophoblast associated lineage markers but cells are transcriptionally distinct from ex vivo
cytotrophoblasts. Trophoblast cells generated by TS conditions are transcriptionally highly
similar to ex vivo cytotrophoblasts and uniquely upregulate endogenous retroviral genes.
Specification of primed iPS cells to TS occurs without entering a naive state and TFAP2A and
ESRRG are central genes regulating the specification. Defining the molecular mechanisms
specifying the trophectoderm is key to understanding placental associated diseases and
improving iPS-derived models.
Results:
Derivation of trophoblast stem cells (TS) from primed human embryonic stem cells and
induced pluripotent stem cells without BMP4
In search of alternative methods to specify iPS cells to trophectoderm, we reasoned that primed
human pluripotent stem cells might be capable of specification to trophoblast stem cells directly
by activating wingless/Integrated (WNT) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) and inhibiting
Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFb) histone deacetylase (HDAC) and Rho-associated
protein kinase (ROCK). While previously described primed iPS differentiations to trophectoderm
have added BMP4, BMP4 is not expressed in the early pre-implantation trophoblast and it is not
known if iPS can differentiate to trophectoderm in the absence of BMP4 ((Blakeley et al., 2015;
Petropoulos et al., 2016; Stirparo et al., 2018). Activation of WNT and EGF and inhibition of
TGFb, HDAC and ROCK enable the long-term culture of human trophoblast stem cells derived
from primary embryos (Okae et al., 2018). 24 hours after clump passage of the human
embryonic stem cell line H1 (Thomson et al., 1998) in primed feeder-free stem cell conditions,
ES colonies demonstrated domed tight packing with defined edges characteristic of primed cells
(Figure 1A and B). 48 hours post passage, cells were switched directly to TSC media. By
brightfield imaging over the subsequent 6 days, we observed that cells proliferated rapidly and
adopted a flatter appearance with some cells adopting a cobblestone appearance (Figure 1AD). After passaging, two morphologically distinct populations emerged. Circular colonies with an
epithelial-like appearance could be seen surrounded by phase bright fibroblastic cells (Figure
1E,F). The inner epithelial-like cells continued to proliferate and appeared morphologically
similar to TS cells derived from primary human embryos (Figure 1G). Immunofluorescence
revealed that subpopulations of the colony cells expressed TP63 and/or KRT7 and minimally
expressed VIM while surrounding fibroblastic cells strongly expressed VIM (Figure 1H). Over
the course of several passages, the epithelial-like cells preferentially expand and reach purity
between passage 5-7. These TSC widely express both TP63 and KRT7 (Figure 1I-K,

Supplemental Figure 1) without expressing the pluripotency genes SOX2 and NANOG
(Supplemental Figure 1). In summary, we find that activating wingless/Integrated (Wnt) and
epidermal growth factor (EGF) and inhibiting Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFb) histone
deacetylase (HDAC) and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) directly in primed iPS lines
results in efficient specification of trophoblast stem cells.
Pluripotent stem cell lines vary in their propensity to differentiate to different cell types (Osafune
et al., 2008). Therefore, we asked if TSC conditions without exogenous BMP4 could specify a
variety of primed human stem cell lines. We confirmed TS specification by VIM, KRT7 and TP63
immunofluorescence on iPS lines reprogrammed from dermal fibroblasts by sendai, named
2014.06 (Supplemental Figure 2), and two postmortem dura fibroblast-derived iPS cell lines
reprogrammed by episome, named LIBD7c6 and LIBD1c8 (Sawada et al., 2020)(Figure 1 H-K).
To confirm the ability to proliferate as TS-like cells, iPS-derived TS lines were passaged for up
to 32 passages and maintained KRT7 and TP63 expression (Figure 1K).
Hypoxia induces differentiation of iPS-derived TS cells into villi-like structures composed
of differentiated syncytial cytotrophoblasts and villus cytotrophoblasts
To investigate the maturation potential of iPS-derived-TSC, we evaluated the ability of iPSderived TS cells to differentiate to mature trophectoderm cell types. Proliferative trophoblast
stem cells are bipotential stem cells with the capacity to differentiate to syncytial
cytotrophoblasts and extravillous cytotrophoblasts (Okae et al 2018). Syncytial cytotrophoblast
is a terminally differentiated multinucleated epithelial layer that infiltrates the maternal
endometrium. The multinucleated cell forms from multiple cytotrophoblast cell fusions. When TS
cells were grown to high density, we observed the spontaneous formation of multinucleated
cells by brightfield microscopy. We confirmed that multinucleated syncytial cells are Ki-67
negative nuclei surrounded by the tight-junction protein ZO-1 positive cells (Figure 2A and B).
We observed large areas of syncytial formation fused nuclei (Figure 2A and S3).
Syncytiotrophoblasts produce and secrete high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCGB3), a hormone essential for cytotrophoblast differentiation, immuno-suppression, and
placental invasion (Cole, 2010). We observe expression of hCGB3 in regions of the
differentiated cytotrophoblast cultures, indicating differentiation to syncytiotrophoblasts (Figure
2C). Extravillus trophoblasts express human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G), the main molecule
involved in maternal immune system evasion upon placental invasion of the endometrium. We
also readily detected regions of HLA-G positive cells, indicating iPS-derived TS cells are
capable of differentiation to extravillous cytotrophoblast (Figure 2D). Expression of hCGB3 and
HLA-G was specific to iPS-derived TS cells and not detected in iPS cells (Supplemental Figure
1I).
To further induce differentiation of the iPS-derived-TSC, we tested if cells will respond to altering
oxygen concentrations. Hypoxia is a natural cue that stimulates syncytial cytotrophoblast
differentiation in vivo (Wakeland et al., 2017), therefore we transitioned a high density TS cell
culture from atmospheric oxygen of 20% to 5%. In 5% oxygen, these cells demonstrate minimal
contact inhibition and form 3D villi-like structures that protrude from the monolayer surface of

the culture dish (Figure 2 E-H). When imaged by confocal microscopy, these villi-like structures
are approximately 50 microns in height. In summary, iPS-derived-TSC readily differentiate into
both HLA-G positive villus cytotrophoblasts and hCGB3 positive syncytial cytotrophoblasts.
Single cell RNA sequencing reveals unique transcriptional programs for iPS-derived TS
specification
To define the molecular events involved in the specification of iPS cells to trophectoderm, we
performed temporal single cell RNAseq analysis of human iPS cells specified to placental
trophoblast cells by three separate conditions: 1) addition of BMP4 (Xu et al., 2002), 2) addition
of BMP4 and inhibition of Wnt with the small molecule inhibitor IWP2 (Horii et al., 2019), 3)
Trophoblast Stem Cell condition (TSC) activation of EGF and Wnt, inhibition of TGFbeta, HDAC
and ROCK signaling to generate trophoblast stem cells (Figure 3A). Sequencing was generated
for iPS cells before differentiation (day 0), for BMP4 on days 4 and 6, for BMP4+IWP2 on days
2, 4 and 6, and on days 2, 4, 6 and 8 for TS condition, resulting in 10 single-cell transcriptomes
(Figure 3A). In TS condition, the day 8 is a timepoint two days after the first passaging
annotated as p1. In the BMP4 and BMP4 + IWP2 conditions, no proliferative cells survived
passaging, therefore the p1 time point was not sequenced. Using the highly parallel droplet
based single cell sequencing method Drop-Seq (Macosko et al., 2015), 9,821 high-quality cells
were obtained after removing cells with less than 1000 genes detected and more than 20% of
mitochondrial mapping. The average ratio of mapping reads for mitochondrial genes in all cells
were 3.9%, indicating good viability (Supplemental Figure 4A). The total number of genes
detected ranged between 21804 for BMP4 + IWP2 day 4 to 27134 for TS day 4 (Supplemental
Figure 4B) time point with between 563 to 1572 high quality cells per timepoint (Supplemental
Figure 4C).
In order to explore the data in an unbiased manner, we performed dimensionality reduction for
the most variable genes across all cells with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform
Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) embedding. Generally, single cells separated by
differentiation stage and condition, with UMAP dimension 2 generally capturing the
differentiation condition (Figure 3B). To identify transcriptionally similar groups of cells, we
performed a graph-based clustering analysis of k nearest neighbors using the euclidean
distance of the 30 first PCs in Seurat (Stuart et al., 2019). We identified 19 clusters, and clusters
contained mostly a single time-point and media condition (Figure 3B-D and S4D and Table S1).
IPS clusters 1, 2 and 3 mostly contained IPS cells with slight contributions from the first days of
all three differentiation conditions. Cells from the BMP4+ IWP-2 condition were found
predominantly in a group of five heterogeneous clusters termed BR (BMP responsive). BR1 was
composed of roughly equal parts iPS cells and BMP4 + IWP-2 day 2 treated cells. BMP4+IWP2
cells made up the majority of the cells in the other BR clusters alongside a smaller population of
BMP4 cells. BR2 and BR3 were predominantly derived from BMP4+IWP2 day 2 cells, while day
4 contributed to BR4, and day 6 contributed to BR. Cells from the BMP4 condition almost
exclusively formed four clusters termed SC (Stromal cell). SC1 and SC3 were predominantly
composed of cells from day 4 of the differentiation while SC2 and SC were predominantly from
day 6 cells. In addition, cluster SC contained a small contribution of cells originating from the

final differentiation day of the TS condition termed TSP1 (TS passage 1). Cells from the TS
differentiation almost exclusively populated 7 clusters termed TS. TS1 was exclusively
composed of Day 2 cells and TS 2-5 were composed of a mixture of cells from days 2-6. The
final TS day (TSP1) separated into two clusters named TS and TS6, which confirms the
brightfield observations of 2 cell populations. Interestingly, 14 cells from BMP4+IWP2 d6 and 4
cells from the BMP4 d6 contribute to the final TS cluster (Figure 3D, Table S1).
To understand how transcriptional profiles change during the differentiation, we asked which
cells express canonical pluripotent, trophectoderm and mesoderm specific genes. We find that
the stem cell transcription factor SOX2 is highest expressed in the iPS stage and is absent from
the most differentiated BR, TS and SC clusters (Figure 3E). SOX2 expression is maintained at a
higher level in the initial days of the TS conditions compared to BMP WNTi and BMP treatment
and absent from the most differentiated TS cells. The Paired-like homeodomain transcription
factor 2 PITX2 is highly expressed in the later stages of BMP4 differentiation, suggesting that
BMP4 conditions generate placental stromal cells (Figure 3F). In single cell RNAseq of the
human placenta, PITX2 was identified as the top marker gene for a stromal fetal communicating
cell type F1 by Vento-Tormo (Liu et al., 2018; Vento-Tormo et al., 2018). Keratin 7, KRT7, and
human chorionic gonadotropin subunit alpha, CGA, are expressed in both stem cell derived
cytotrophoblasts and in vivo placenta (Yabe et al., 2016). Indicating specification to
trophectoderm transcriptional programs, we find both KRT7 and CGA are expressed in the later
stages of the BMP+ WNTi condition and TS condition (Figure 3G-H). Overall, both TS and
BMP4+ WNTi treated cells demonstrated an increased expression for most TB markers
including GATA3 and TFAP2C (Figure S5A) while the BMP4 alone conditions demonstrated a
more mesoderm associated expression of GATA4, TBXT and PDGFRA (Figure S5B). In mouse,
the Caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX2) is involved in the segregation of the ICM and
trophectoderm lineages at the blastocyst stage by repressing OCT4/POU5F1 and NANOG in
the TE. Overexpression of CDX2 in mouse embryonic stem cells causes differentiation to
trophoblast stem cells (Erwin et al., 2012; Niwa et al., 2005). In humans, CDX2 expression is
initiated after blastocyst formation and has variable expression patterns in trophectoderm
(Niakan and Eggan, 2013). Similar to TS cells derived from primary human embryos, CDX2 is
not expressed in the differentiated TS state, and there is sparse expression of CDX2 at d4 of all
differentiations (Figure S5A).
Next we asked which genes are preferentially expressed in each cluster by non-parametric
Wilcoxon rank sum test (adj.p-value < 0.05; logFC > 0.25)(Figure 3I, Table S2). We defined cellpopulation markers by comparing gene expression of each cell population compared to all other
cells. DUSP6 and THY1 are primed stem cell state genes and are among the top marker genes
identified in the iPS cells. The SC cluster marker genes includes WNT signaling genes RSPO2
a WNT agonist (Kazanskaya et al., 2004) and PITX2 which interacts with both WNT signaling
and regulates collagen expression during development (Hendee et al., 2018). Markers of the BR
cluster include PRSS23 a serine protease involved in Snail-dependent Epithelial to
Mesenchymal Transition (Chen et al., 2013) and regulators of Insulin-like growth factor signaling
IGFBP7 (Oh et al., 1996) and PAPPA2 (Overgaard et al., 2001). Markers of the TS clusters
include genes involved in EGFR signaling NPNT (Arai et al., 2017), IFI6 (Meyer et al., 2015),

and MUC15 (Wang et al., 2013). Additionally, ARHGAP18 is a Rho GTPase activating protein
that functions as a downstream effector of YAP signaling (Porazinski et al., 2015) recently
implicated in the specification HiPS to bipotent trophoblast stem cells (Mischler et al., 2019).
In sum, TSC, BMP4 and BMP4 with inhibition of WNT pattern different cell types. Activation of
WNT and EGF and inhibition of TGFb, HDAC and ROCK specify primed iPSC to
cytotrophoblasts, BMP4 alone induces mesenchymal fates and inhibition of WNT in the context
of BMP4 generates a small percentage of TS cells. For use by the community, we provide a
web browser of the single cell expression profiles
(http://erwinpaquolalab.libd.org/publications/singlecellTS) and the differentially expressed genes
for all pairwise cluster comparisons (Table S3).
iPS-derived trophoblast stem cells resemble first trimester placental cytotrophoblasts
while BMP4 differentiation generates placental mesenchymal cells
We next asked how similar are the iPS-derived placental cells to ex vivo cells found in human
placenta. There is considerable debate about the authenticity of iPS derived trophoblast cells
and primary trophoblast stem cells, therefore we set out to directly compare the single cell
transcriptional profiles to ex vivo datasets. To characterize the expression profiles of the 19
clusters, we analyzed the overlap with cell type-specific genes identified by two published
single-cell studies of early human placenta (Liu et al., 2018; Vento-Tormo et al., 2018). We
performed gene set enrichment analyses using Cell-Specific Expression Analysis (CSEA) (Xu et
al., 2014). We identified cell type specific genes that were preferentially expressed in each cell
type/cluster of the 19 clusters from iPS-derived cells by the specificity index probability (pSI)
statistic at thresholds of p< 0.05. Next, we tested whether cell-type specific genes previously
identified by single cell studies of human placenta are over-represented in the cell-type specific
genes from our iPS specification by hypergeometric test and applied the Bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons, considering all the tested gene lists [α = 0.05/ (19× (38+14)) = 5.1×105
]. Vento-Tormo identified a set of 38 cell types from maternal (decidua and blood) and fetal
tissues (placenta) of first trimester placenta and reported 30 cell-type specific genes per cell
type (Vento-Tormo et al., 2018). We found that the transcriptional profile from all iPS clusters
and clusters from d2-d4 timepoints did not have significant enrichment for any of the placental
cell type clusters (Figure S6A). In contrast, the most mature iPS-derived TS cluster was highly
enriched for the syncytial cytotrophoblast (SCT) and villous cytotrophoblast (VCT) cluster
(p=log10-32 and log10-17) (Figure 4A). The expression profile of the iPS-derived TS cluster was
highly specific for SCT and VCT with no significant enrichment for any other cell-type in the
maternal fetal interface. The D6 BMP4 cluster SC was most enriched in the two fibroblast
clusters (F1 and F2) (p=log10-26 and p=log10-13). Vento-Tormo described these placental
fibroblasts as mesenchymal stromal cells of fetal origin that derive from the primitive endoderm
expressing GATA4, GATA6, PDGFRa, and SOX17 (Figure S6 and S7). The BMP4 + IWP2
conditions (BR) were not strongly enriched for any specific placental cell type and instead had
weaker enrichment for several clusters including syncytial cytotrophoblast (SCT), and maternal
decidua derived F1 endodermal cell type and dS1. In sum, iPS-derived TS cells are highly

enriched for expression of genes specific to syncytial cytotrophoblast and villous cytotrophoblast
of ex vivo human placenta.
Next we compared the expression profiles to early placental dataset from the 8 week and 24
week placenta (Liu et al., 2018) (Figure 4B). Again, we found strong enrichment for the iPSderived TS cells in the eight week fusion competent CTB1 (cytotrophoblast, log10-9). BMP4 alone
and BMP4 + IWP2 conditions were enriched for two different mesoderm cells identified by Liu et
al (log10-23 and log10-4). To visualize placental cell-type specific expression patterns among the
iPS-derived cell types, we plotted a heatmap of the top unique markers of the fetal cell types
identified in Vento-Tormo and polar trophectoderm markers identified in (Petropoulos et al.,
2016) (Figure 4C). Consistent with the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, we observed high
expression for a majority of unique marker genes previously identified in polar trophectoderm
villus cytotrophoblasts (VCT) and syncytial cytotrophoblasts (SCT). We also compared the
expression profiles of all iPS-derived cellular clusters to previously identified lineage and marker
genes from pre-implantation datasets (Stirparo et al 2018, Figure S7A). Again, we found the
highest expression of trophoblast genes KRT18, TEAD3, GATA3 and GATA2 in iPS derived TS,
with moderate expression in BR cells. Primitive endoderm genes SOX17, GATA4, GATA6 were
highest expressed in SC cells. When compared to primary trophoblast cells (Suryawanshi et al
2019, Figure S7B), we confirmed that TS cells expressed the highest level of cytotrophoblast
and EVT specific genes. In summary, iPS cells specified via TS conditions have a
transcriptional profile highly homologous to cytotrophoblasts taken directly from human placenta
while BMP4 differentiation generates placental mesenchymal cells.
Primed iPS specify to trophoblast by activation of TFAP2A without activation of naive
stem cell programs
It has been reported that primed stem cells are restricted in their potency and unable to
differentiate to TSC while naive stem cells readily differentiate to TSC because they are poised
to specify to trophectoderm (Dong et al., 2020). Therefore, we asked if the primed iPS or TSCM
treated cells adopt a naive stem cell program during differentiation. For 12 previously identified
naive marker genes (Messmer et al., 2019), naive transcripts were nearly absent. Five genes
HORMAD1, ALPPL2, KHD3L, TRIM60, and HYAL4 had no observed expression in any cell
(Figure 5A, Table S4). Less than 1% of cells for any condition had detectable expression for six
other marker genes ALPP, OLAH, LYZ, MEG8, KDC1L, and FAM151A. ZNF729 was the only
gene expressed in 0.51% of TSp1 cells to 14.69% of IWP2d2. In contrast, primed marker genes
were consistently expressed in iPS clusters and often throughout the differentiation state. For
example, DUSP6 was detected in 74.87% of the iPS cells, indicating that the iPS initiated in the
primed state. In sum, primed iPS transition to cytotrophoblasts without transitioning through a
naive state.
We asked how BMP signaling contributes to the differentiation by evaluating BMP family
signaling in all samples. Low percentages of cells expressed BMP4 in TS conditions, while
BMP4 was significantly upregulated in several cell clusters including Day 4 BMP4 and BMP4 +
IWP2 treated cells compared to iPS and TS cell clusters (Figure 5B, Table S4). BMP5 and

BMP7 were expressed in a larger portion of TSCM treated cells compared to iPS (BMP5: 00.67% iPS vs 24.72% TS1 cells and BMP7: 1.01-4.71% iPS vs 29.06% TS1 cells). The BMP
effector proteins SMAD1,4, and 5 is expressed in the first days of all conditions and is absent
from the mature TS cluster. We conclude that BMP5 and BMP7 signaling patterns iPS-derived
TS specification instead of BMP4.
To identify the most significant gene expression changes associated with the initial stages of TS
specification, we studied a subset of the sample using only cells from the iPS and TS day 2
samples and applied a single-cell trajectory inference and pseudotime estimation (STREAM) to
the single cell transcriptome data (Chen et al., 2019). Briefly, single cells were ordered along
probabilistic trajectories and a numeric value referred to as pseudotime was assigned to each
cell to indicate how far it progresses along the dynamic differentiation. STREAM identifies an
initial branch composed of both iPS and TS day2 cells (S3-S0). This level of analysis also
identified branches containing IPS cells (S0-S2, S0-S4), reflecting the pluripotency continuum,
as well as a TS day 2 (S0-S1) branch reflecting the exit from pluripotency (Figure 5C and Table
S5). On branch S3-S0, node S3 was predominantly composed of iPS cells while TS day 2 cells
are more abundant towards S0 (Figure 5C, S8A,B). We next identified the transcriptional states
that contribute to the specification by identifying highly expressed genes within a branch that are
correlated with the transition along the specification branches (see methods). Top positively
correlated transition genes along branch S3-S0 include LRRN3 which amplifies MAPK signaling
through EGFR (Fukamachi et al., 2002), MEIS2 which codes for a TALE homeobox protein that
promotes tumor progression through the combined action of two isoforms increasing YAP
nuclear translocation and activating the WNT/b-catenin pathway (Guan et al., 2019), BMP5,
BMPR1B and TFAP2A a transcription factor key to the suppression of pluripotency and
expression of trophoblast associated genes (Krendl et al., 2017) (Figure 5C, S8C). These genes
were expressed not only along branch S3-S0 but also along branch S0-S1 (Figure S8C). The
branch S0-S1 captures the transition out of the pluripotent state and into the TS state with
upregulation of cytokeratins (KRT18, KRT19, KRT8) and calcium binding proteins (S100A11,
S100A10) known to be expressed in trophectoderm (Abd El-Aleem and Dekker, 2018; Liu et al.,
2006) (Figure S8D). Also found as a top transition gene, TMSB4X is implicated in stemness of
progenitor trophoblast cells of first trimester human placentas by increasing NOTCH1 activity
(Huang et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2018; Lv et al., 2013). In summary, trophectoderm transcriptional
programming occurs early in the specification and utilizes previously identified trophectoderm
associated regulatory factors including TMSB4X, YAP, BMP5, and TFAP2A.
STREAM pseudotime analysis of trophoblast differentiations reveals upregulation of
stromal mesenchyme upon BMP4 treatment and trophectoderm transcriptional
programming upon TS treatment.
To understand the transcriptional changes associated with the full trajectory of iPS to
trophectoderm specification, we repeated the STREAM analysis with the complete iPS to d8
dataset. STREAM identifies 4 main branching points among all single cells (Figure 6A). The
early differentiation days for all conditions were mixed in pseudotime demonstrating a similar
transcriptional state at the initial phases of IPS commitment when compared in the context of d6

and d8 cells. Similar to the UMAP projection (Figure 3B,C), STREAM inferred mixing of two iPS
stages with cells from the d2 treatments. STREAM inferred three main branching points which
separated based on the most differentiated cells from each condition. To reveal the
transcriptional states that contribute to the branching, we carried out differential expression
analysis to identify highly expressed genes within a branch that are differentially expressed
compared to all other branches, termed leaf gene detection analysis in STREAM (see methods)
(Figure 6B, Table S6). For the zero IPS branch point, pluripotent-specific genes including
DNMT3A and POU5F1/OCT4 were highly differentially expressed. For the branch of cells
exposed to BMP4 (SC), mesoderm markers including PITX2 were identified as differentially
expressed. For the BMP+IWP2 branch, placental associated genes were identified including
RAB31, a small GTPases highly expressed in placenta that regulates intracellular membrane
trafficking of ligand bound EGFR (Chua and Tang, 2014). For the TS branch, significantly
differentially expressed genes were associated with trophectoderm commitment and
implantation and preeclampsia including GATA3. We performed a Gene Ontology enrichment
analysis for biological processes using the top 300 significantly differentially expressed leaf
genes for the TS branch. Significantly overrepresented GO categories included placental
development, female pregnancy, viral processes (Figure 6 C,D).
Human endogenous retrovirus derived genes participate in a regulatory subnetwork
specifically within iPS-derived trophoblast stem cells
We found the set of genes involved in viral-like processes are upregulated in the later TS
differentiation timepoints (Figure 6C). This echoes an increasing body of evidence
demonstrating that endogenous retroviruses play a fundamental role in the evolutionary
diversification of the mammalian placenta (Johnson, 2019). Therefore, we asked what is the
expression of human ERV-derived genes during trophectoderm specification? We found specific
upregulation of five ERV-derived genes in the most differentiated TS cell type (Figure 7A).
To understand the place of ERV-derived genes in the regulatory TS regulatory network, we
analyzed the participation of ERV-derived genes in a gene regulatory network. We built a
transcription factor and target gene network model using the Passing Attributes between
Networks for Data Assimilation (PANDA) algorithm to all clusters among the conditions. PANDA
integrates information from TF-sequence-motif data, gene expression and protein-protein
interaction (PPI) in a message-passing approach (Glass et al., 2013). Briefly, PANDA’s
algorithm makes the assumption that genes targeted by the same TF are more likely to be coexpressed than genes that are regulated by a different TF. Using a TF-sequence motif as initial
network model, the algorithm refines and updates the model by computing the congruence
between two measures: 1) Concordance in co-expression of genes presenting motif for a same
TF, and 2) Concordance in the regulatory profile of a set of TFs that interact with each other via
Protein-protein interaction data. Therefore, the likelihood of interaction between a TF and a
target gene is given by its edge weight, which states for the coordination of targets’ expression
by a TF complex. PANDA outputs Z-score normalized edge weights, therefore positive and
negative weights can be seen as likely and unlikely interactions respectively. One network was

created for each previously identified cell cluster based on the expression profile of the top 100
cells in each cluster (based on PC1) with genes expressed in at least 10% cells.
We found that ERV interactions (Transcription Factors + ERV-derived genes) are prominent in
the most differentiated TS cluster and in no other cell clusters. We found regulatory interactions
for five ERV-derived genes (ERVH48-1, ERV3-1, ERVMER34-1, ERVW-1 and ERVFRD-1) are
highly unique to the TS cluster network, while only 0 or 1 ERV-derived gene was found in the
other cell clusters (Figure 7B, S9A). Clusters SC and SC 3 (BMP4 cells) exhibited interactions
for gene ERVH48-1, and clusters BR 1, BR 3 and BR 4 (BMP4+IWP2 cells) presented the gene
ERV3-1. Interestingly, genes encompassed in ERV regulatory interactions of iPS derived TS
cells were enriched in biological pathways related to hormone metabolism, cell differentiation
and the immune system (adj. p value < 0.01) (Figure 7C, Table S7). In addition, we observed
ERV regulatory interactions are also enriched for categories such as placenta development,
trophectodermal cell differentiation and syncytium formation (Table S7). To understand the
significance of the ERV-subnetwork interactions, we next asked what is the strength of ERV
edges in the network context of the TS cluster? We found that weights of ERV regulatory
interactions were highly ranked among all network connections (Wilcoxon Rank Sum
pval=1.6778e-31, permuted p value=0.001). In sum, we find that ERV-derived genes participate
in a regulatory subnetwork specifically within TS cells.
Coronavirus associated host factors are expressed in iPS-derived TS cells and could
potentially model cytotrophoblast involvement in infection
We next asked if these iPS-derived cells could be relevant to model the cytotrophoblast
involvement in infection. Infections of pregnant women can severely impact both the developing
fetus and pregnant women. Trophoblast cells at the maternal-fetal interphase play a crucial role
in the impact of these infections. Syncytiotrophoblasts are the barrier that protects the fetus from
some infections (Parry et al., 1997). The permissiveness of trophoblast cells to a specific
infection largely determines if an infection reaches the fetus. Pathogens such as Toxoplasma
gondii, Rubella, herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus, and Zika virus can cross the placenta, infect the
fetus and cause congenital disease (Stegmann and Carey, 2002; Coyne and Lazear, 2016). It is
still too soon to know the complete impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on pregnant women
and fetus. But it has been established that the placenta can be infected by SARS-CoV-2
(Vivanti et al., 2020). Emerging data suggest that placental SARS-CoV-2 infections are rare
(Vivanti et al., 2020), perhaps because the CoV-2 host entry substrate angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the serine protease TMPRSS2 are minimally expressed in the placenta
(Pique-Regi et al., 2020). Although ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression are rare in the maternal
fetal interface, alternative entry receptors such as BSG (Aguiar et al., 2020). When considering
expression analysis of confirmed and potential SARS-CoV-2 host factors, Singh et al reported
that the cytotrophoblast is the cell type most susceptible to coronavirus infection in the first
trimester placenta while confirming that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are lowly expressed (Singh et al.,
2020).

To evaluate the potential tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in iPS-derived TS cells, we profiled SARSCoV-2 and coronavirus associated factors. Overall, iPS-derived TS cells expressed coronavirus
associated factors in similar patterns compared to ex vivo cytotrophoblasts (Singh et al., 2020),
(Pique-Regi et al., 2020). ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are minimally expressed (Figure 8A, Table S8)
and putative alternative entry receptors BSG, HSPA5 and DPP4 are more expressed. Other
potential entry proteases CTSB, CTSL and FURIN are all expressed at a higher level (Figure
8B, Table S8). The placenta also protects the fetus from infection by the active transfer of
maternal antibodies to the fetus. Syncytiotrophoblasts transfer protective humoral maternal IgG
to the fetus via the neonatal Fc receptor encoded by the FCGRT gene (Leach et al., 1996).
Consistent with the findings that iPS-derived TS cells are transcriptionally similar to
cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts, iPS-derived TS cells also express FCGRT. In sum,
iPS-derived TS cells are highly transcriptionally similar to ex vivo cytotrophoblasts and
syncytiotrophoblasts with respect to placental host factors involved in infection. Therefore, iPSderived TS cells may be useful to model the involvement of human cytotrophoblasts in infection.
Discussion
Here we demonstrate that primed iPS cells are specified to trophectoderm without BMP4 and
instead with EGF, TGF-β inhibitors, a WNT activator and Valproic acid induced HDAC inhibition.
IPS-derived TS cells are highly transcriptionally similar to cytotrophoblasts found in human
placenta. TS cells proliferate rapidly, display very variably sized nuclei, readily become
multinucleated as observed in early post-implantation trophoblast and strongly express
extravillous and syncytiotrophoblast associated proteins (HLA-G, HCG-β) in sub populations.
After eight days of specification, iPS-derived TS cells display a uniquely active transcriptional
network of human endogenous retroviruses similar to in vivo trophoblast. We demonstrate that
in hypoxic conditions, iPS-derived TS cells create 3D villi-like structures, conditions which will
likely be useful for future 3D organoid models.
The ability of primed human stem cells to differentiate into true trophectoderm lineages is under
debate. Here we demonstrate that primed human stem cells retain a broad potency to generate
extra embryonic lineages which are transcriptionally highly similar to placenta. Our results are
consistent with the model that the primed state is on a continuum of potency, rather than a fixed
and restricted state (Weinberger et al., 2016). Methodological differences and the frequent use
of BMP4 likely underlie previously reported differences in the ability of primed and naive
pluripotent stem cells to generate TSCs. We confirm that the BMP4 model can generate cells
with key features of trophoblast, but in the defined conditions used here BMP4 specified cells
are less similar to in vivo cytotrophoblasts. Following the recent derivation of human TSCs from
primary cells (Mischler et al., 2019; Okae et al., 2018), several attempts have been made to
derive TSCs from ES/iPS from a range of pluripotent states. Mischler et al. 2019 used primed
ES cells with a hybrid protocol that combined a three day treatment of BMP4 and SB431542
with long term culture in TM4 media (CYM554 a S1PR3 agonist, CHIR99021, A83-01, and
FGF10) to generate a CDX2+ TSC-like population (Mischler et al., 2019; Okae et al., 2018).
When transferred to TSCM media, these cells lost CDX2 expression and adopted
characteristics of TSCs. Omitting TM4 media and directly transferring BMP4 treated cells to

TSCM resulted in a gradually enriching population of epithelial cells comparable with their
CDX2- TSC-like population. Interestingly, this process mirrors the differentiation progression we
observed when we directly treated primed iPS with TSCM. Our data suggest that BMP4 is not
involved in this transition. TSC-like cells have also been generated from primed iPS cells using
a micromesh culture system with primed pluripotent stem cell media followed by culture in
TSCM (Li et al., 2019) although the comparison of these cells to in vivo placental cells is less
extensive. In contrast, Dong et al. 2020 reported that only naive and not primed ES could
generate TSC-like cells by direct exposure to TSCM (Dong et al., 2020). Human expanded
potential stem cells (EPSCs) can also generate TSC-like cells when differentiated in TSCM
(Gao et al., 2019). Interestingly, this group was unable to generate TSC-like cells using naive or
primed ES cells under similar conditions. Here, we demonstrate that the continuum of
pluripotency present in the primed state readily allows for specification to trophectoderm.
The robust differentiation of primed iPS cells to trophectoderm allows for modeling of placental
diseases from patient-specific cells without first trimester primary tissue. Placental adaptive
responses to insults can alter fetal development and program the fetus for later disease
including diabetes and neurodevelopmental disorders (Myatt, 2006). As both the protective
barrier and a component of the innate immune system, cytotrophoblasts and their progeny play
important roles in the outcome of insults (Guleria and Pollard, 2000). Recent evidence that
Covid19 leads to a hyperimmune state has implications for placental biology and fetal
development, potentially analogous to the effects of other hyperimmune states during
pregnancy (Al-Haddad et al., 2019). Genetic variation among individuals influences how a
pathogen affects the fetus. iPS models of this genetic variation could be harnessed for
therapeutic intervention. We anticipate that iPS-derived TS cells will be a powerful model to
study the placental contribution to disease and the genetic regulation of human placental
evolution.

Methods
PSC culture
6-well plates were coated with reduced growth factor Cultrex (1mg/12 ml DMEM/F12) at 37°C
for at least one hour. Human ES and iPS were maintained on coated plates in Stemflex media.
Media was changed every 48hrs in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. Cells
were passaged in small clusters using Versene solution and a split ratio of 1:10-1:12. For
cryopreservation, cells were suspended in PSC media and temporarily stored in a deep freezer
at −80°C before being transferred to liquid nitrogen for long term storage.
Differentiations and Cell Maintenance
6-well plates were coated with reduced growth factor Cultrex (1mg/12 ml DMEM/F12) at 37°C
for at least one hour. PSC were harvested in small clusters using Versene solution without
centrifugation, seeded at a passage ratio of 1:12, and cultured in 2 mL of Stemflex medium.
After 24 hours, cells were washed with DPBS and 2 mL of appropriate media was added to
each differentiating well. For TS differentiation, TS medium [DMEM/F12 with Glutamax
supplemented with 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% FBS, 0.3% BSA, 1% ITS-X supplement,
1.5 μg/ml L-ascorbic acid, 50 ng/ml EGF, 2 μM CHIR99021, 0.5 μM A83-01, 1 μM SB431542,
0.8 mM VPA and 5 μM Y27632] was added to each well. For BMP4 based differentiations 10
ng/ml BMP4 and/or 2uM IWP2 was added to basal differentiation medium (DMEM/F12 with
Glutamax supplemented with ITS and L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate magnesium) was added to
each well. Every 24 hours 2 mL of fresh medium was added to each well. Cells were collected
on day 2, 4, and 6 for RNA sequencing. For the TS condition, after 6 days of differentiation cells
were passaged using TrypLE express at a split ratio of 1:3 and plated on new Cultrex or col IV
(5 ug/mL) coated plates. After the first passage, cells were fed every 48 hours and split at a ratio
of 1:3-1:6 every 3-4 days. Mature TS cells between passages 10-20 were used for all
experiments unless otherwise noted. Cells were cultured in humidified incubators 5% CO2 and
20% O2. For hypoxic cultures, O2 levels were reduced to 5%. For cryopreservation, TS cells
were suspended in Cell Banker 1 and temporarily stored in a deep freezer at −80°C before
being transferred to liquid nitrogen for long term storage.
Immunofluorescence Staining
Cells were washed in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS), fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde for ten
minutes, and washed three times in TBS. Cells were then incubated in blocking solution (3%
horse serum, 0.1% Triton-X in TBS) for one hour at room temperature before being incubated
with primary antibodies in blocking solution overnight at 4°C. Cells were then rinsed twice and
incubated with secondary antibodies in blocking solution for two hours at room temperature.
After two washes in TBS cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 and rinsed twice in
TBS. Cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM770 or LSM780 confocal microscope. The
brightness and/or contrast was globally adjusted for some images.
Single Cell sequencing by Dropseq
Dissociation of Cells for Dropseq
Human iPS cells were grown to 80-90% confluency. After washing cells with DPBS (Thermo
Fisher Scientific 14190250) cells were incubated with Versene (Thermo Fisher Scientific

15040066) solution for approximately 10 minutes at 37 °C and gently washed up and down with
a P1000 pipette to generate a single cell suspension. Cells were then diluted in Stemflex media
and centrifuged at 200g for 4 min before being resuspended in 1 mL of 1X PBS, pH 7.4 (Gibco,
# 10010023) with 0.01% BSA (Invitrogen, # AM2616) at the concentration of 100 cells/µL.
Droplet generation
Barcoded beads (Chemgenes, # Macosko-2011-10) were washed with 30 mL of ethanol (Sigma
Aldrich, # E7023-500ML), then removed all ethanol after centrifugation at 1,000g for 1 minute.
Washed beads were suspended in 30 mL of TE-TW (10 mM Tris pH8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5%
SDS) and spun down at 1,000g for 1 minute. TE-TW was discarded and re-suspended in 20 mL
of TE-TW. 100 µm strainer (Corning, Cat# 352360) was used for size selection of beads.
Beads were suspended as the concentration of 120 beads/µL in 1 mL of the lysis buffer. To
generate droplets, cells, beads, and oil (BioRad, #186-4006) were loaded into the 125-μm
microfluidic device after aquapel flush treatment (FlowJEM). The cells and barcoded beads
suspension were flown at 2 mL/h each and at 13 mL/h for oil.
Droplet breakage, reverse transcription, and exonuclease I treatment
Droplets were collected into the 50 mL tubes and 30 mL of 6X SSC was added, then broken
with 1 mL of perfluorooctanol (Sigma, # 370533). Collected beads were washed with 1 mL of 6X
SSC twice and with 300 µLof RT buffer. On removing the RT buffer, reverse transcription
mixture was added into the beads. To synthesize cDNA, beads in RT mix were incubated with
rotation at room temperature for 30 minutes and 42 °C for 90 minutes. The reverse transcription
mixture was prepared as in the reference, Macosko, E.Z. et. al., Cell 161, 1202-1214 (2015).
Beads were washed once with 1 mL of TE-SDS, twice with 1 mL of TE-TW, and with 1 mL of 10
mM Tris pH 8.0. Exonuclease I treatment was performed to remove excess bead primers at 37
°C for 45 minutes with rotation followed by washing beads once with 1 mL of TE-SDS, twice
with 1 mL of TE-TW, and with 1 mL of molecular grade water.
PCR amplification, clean-up with SPRI beads, and library preparation
Unique barcode STAMPs (Single-cell Transcriptomes Attached to MicroParticles) were
resuspended in 1 mL H2O, and loaded on a hemocytometer (Incyto, # DHC-N01). Aliquots of
3,000 beads in 24.6 µL of H2O were amplified with 0.8 µM SMART PCR primer (IDT, 5’-AAG
CAG TGG TAT CAA CGC AGA GT-3’) and 2X KAPA HiFi Hotstart Ready Mix (Fisher Scientific,
# KK2602) using the following PCR condition: (step 1) 95 °C for 3 min, (step 2) four cycles of:
98 °C for 20 sec, 65 °C for 45 sec, 72 °C for 3 min, (step 3) 10 cycles of: 98 °C for 20 sec, 67 °C
for 20 s, 72 °C for 3 min, and (step 4) finally, 72 °C for 5 min.
Purified cDNA with 0.6X SPRI beads were analyzed with High Sensitive DNA kit (Agilent, #
5067-4626), then tagmented and amplified using Nextera XT Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, #
FC-131-1096) by manufacturer's manual for sequencing.
Sequencing
All libraries were checked its quality with Agilent High Sensitive DNA chips before sequencing.
Each library was diluted at 3 nM for an Illumina HiSeq 3000. We used HiSeq SBS 50 cycle kits
for sequence (paired-end): 21-bp for read 1 with Custom Read1 primer (IDT, 5’-

GCCTGTCCGCGGAAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTAC-3’), 21-bp for read 2, and 8-bp for
index 1.
Preprocessing of Drop-seq data
Raw sequencing data was preprocessed using the pipeline “Drop-seq Alignment Cookbook”
v2.0.0 found at https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq/releases/ and described in (Macosko
et al., 2015). Briefly, paired-end reads were filtered in order to remove read pairs with any base
with quality of less than 10 in both cellular and molecular barcodes. SMART adapters at 5’ end
and polyA tails at 3’ end with 6 or more bp were removed from the second pair, and then
aligned to the reference human (GRCh38) genome using HISAT2 v2.1.0 (Kim et al., 2015) with
the default settings. Uniquely mapped reads were retained and grouped by cell barcode. UMI
barcodes with a hamming distance = 1 were merged within each cell, and the number of
transcripts of each gene was defined based on the total number of each distinct UMI sequence,
for that gene, in a given cell.
Clustering and Differential Gene Expression analysis for Marker Genes
All downstream analysis for quality control, clustering, and differential expression were
performed using Seurat (Stuart et al., 2019) v3.0 R package. Data was initially filtered to remove
low quality cells and very low detected genes. We discarded cells with less than 1000 genes
detected and with more than 20% of mitochondrial gene content. Genes expressed in less than
3 cells were also removed. Variance stabilizing and normalization was performed using
sctransform (Hafemeister and Satija, 2019) approach adjusting for library size and the
percentage of mitochondrial genes in each cell. To cluster the cells, cell distances were defined
with 30 first PCs using a graph-based approach implemented in Seurat, that briefly build a Knearest neighbor (KNN) graph based on euclidean distance in PCA space, with subsequent
refining of edge weights using Jacard similarity. Clusters were defined using Seurat default
algorithm – a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph based on k-nearest neighbors with
modularity optimization using original Louvain algorithm. Gene markers of cell clusters were
defined using ROC analysis for only genes with at least 0.25 logFC average difference between
the clusters. Graphic visualizations of clusters and gene expression were done using Seurat
and ggplot2 in R.
Single-cell trajectory reconstruction
Reconstruction of cell differentiation trajectories for cell clusters was performed with STREAM
(Single cell Trajectories Reconstruction, Exploration and Mapping) (Chen et al., 2019) Python
package. The expression data of high quality cells (9,821 cells) was library size normalized,
scaled, natural-log transformed and used as input for STREAM. Data dimension reduction was
done with Spectral Embedding (SE) based on most variable genes found with LOESS fitting.
Branches representing trajectory structure were learned based on 3 SE dimensions.
Marker genes of each branch were defined by Leaf gene detection analysis implemented in the
STREAM package. Initially, the average expression of each gene is calculated for all branches.
Based on the average expressions, Z-scores are computed and genes are picked as candidates
when greater than 1.5. Then a Kruskal–Wallis H-test is calculated for each candidate to test the
difference of gene expression among branches. Finally, the Conover test for multiple

comparison is computed for the differentially expressed candidates (Krustal-Wallis p-value <
0.01) between all branches, and genes with Conover p-value < 0.01 are picked as a Leaf gene
for that branch. GO enrichment analysis of branch markers were performed for top 100 leaf
genes using hypergeometric test with GOstats v2.48.0 R package. Circus plot with GO terms
was done using GOplot v1.0.2 R package.
Transition genes were found by performing transition gene analysis implemented in STREAM.
The algorithm starts ordering cells based on their inferred pseudotime and splits them in two
groups. One group contains 20% of cells closer to the pseudotime start point, and the other is
composed of all remaining cells (80%). Gene average expressions are calculated for each
group and genes with a log2 fold change greater than 0.25 between groups are picked as
candidate genes. Then, Spearman’s rank correlation is computed between inferred pseudotime
and gene expression of the candidates. Genes with correlation coefficient above 0.4 are
reported as transition genes.
Overrepresentation analysis was performed by using the algorithm MSET (Eisinger et al., 2013)
implemented in R, using 10000 permutations. The list of transcription factors related to
trophoblast differentiation used is described in (Krendl et al., 2017).
Clusters enrichment analysis for placental cell-specific genes.
To characterize the expression profiles of the 19 clusters detected in this work, we analyzed the
overlap with cell-specific genes identified by previous single-cell studies. We used two sets of
candidate genes. A set of 38 cell-specific gene lists (30 gene each) was drawn from the
supplementary table 2 of (Vento-Tormo et al. 2018). These gene lists span both maternal
(decidua and blood) and fetal tissues (placenta). Another set of 14 cell-specific gene lists was
drawn from the supplementary table 1 of (Liu et al. 2018), which also span analogous tissues.
To profile the expression patterns of the 19 clusters detected in this work, we applied the CellSpecific Expression Analysis (CSEA) as implemented in the pSI R package (Xu et al., 2014).
This approach compares each profile with all the others and identifies genes expressed in one
group but not in the others, calculates a score (specificity index, SI) for each gene and attributes
a statistical level of significance (pSI). Here, we used the normalized expression matrix to
compute cluster-level median gene expression for each gene, which defined 19 cluster profiles.
Then, cluster profiles were used to compute SI and pSI for each gene, within each profile.
Cluster-specific gene lists were obtained applying the statistical threshold, pSI < 0.05.
Finally, we tested whether cell-specific genes from previous studies are over-represented in our
clusters. We used the hypergeometric test and applied the Bonferroni correction for multiple
comparisons, considering all the tested gene lists [α = 0.05/ (19× (38+14)) = 5.1×10-5].
PANDA regulatory networks
Gene regulatory networks were constructed using the pandaR v1.14.0 R package which
integrates multiple types of data to infer direct interactions (edges) between TFs and target
genes. PANDA initiates with a prior regulatory network that can be built by mapping TF binding
sites to the genome, and refines this initial network integrating gene expression data of target
genes and TF PPI data. The main idea behind the algorithm is that target genes from a given

TF are likely co-expressed, and TFs that interact with each other are more likely to regulate a
similar group of target genes. These two assumptions are used to infer the edge weight of each
TF-target interaction, and basically reflects the congruence between the regulatory profile of a
TF with target gene co-expression. Iteratively the algorithm refine the initial network structure
and infer a final consensus regulatory network.
A regulatory network was built for each cluster using as initial network a TF-motif binding map
described in (Sonawane et al., 2017) and downloaded in
(https://sites.google.com/a/channing.harvard.edu/kimberlyglass/tools/resources). Gene
expression data was library size normalized, scaled, and natural-log transformed. Genes
expressed in less than 10% of the cells of each cluster were filtered out. PPI network of TFs
was built using STRING database v11.0 (downloaded from https://string-db.org/) and score
interactions were divided by 1000 to initiate the PANDA.
Edges with negative weights estimated by PANDA were discarded in order to explore only
interactions with greater evidence. The relative importance of individual genes in the network
topology was addressed with the betweenness centrality measure calculated using the Igraph
v1.2.4 R package. For each cluster, the significance of betweenness values were calculated
based on the betweenness probability distribution of 100 random networks constructed with the
same number of edges of that cluster. Graphic visualization, gene clusterization, and GO
enrichment analysis of gene clusters within networks were performed using Cytoscape v3.7.2
(Shannon et al., 2003) and ClueGO v2.5.4.ENRICHMENT/RANKING ANALYSIS (Bindea et al.,
2009).
