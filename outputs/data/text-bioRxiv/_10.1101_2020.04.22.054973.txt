Received: date / Accepted: date

Abstract Internet forums and public social media, such as online healthcare forums,
provide a convenient channel for users (people/patients) concerned about health issues to discuss and share information with each other. In late December 2019, an
outbreak of a novel coronavirus (infection from which results in the disease named
COVID-19) was reported, and, due to the rapid spread of the virus in other parts of the
world, the World Health Organization declared a state of emergency. In this paper, we
used automated extraction of COVID-19–related discussions from social media and
a natural language process (NLP) method based on topic modeling to uncover various issues related to COVID-19 from public opinions. Moreover, we also investigate
how to use LSTM recurrent neural network for sentiment classification of COVID-19
comments. Our findings shed light on the importance of using public opinions and
suitable computational techniques to understand issues surrounding COVID-19 and
to guide related decision-making.

1 Introduction
Online forums, such as reddit, enable healthcare service providers to collect people/patient experience data. These forums are valuable sources of people’s opinions,
which can be examined for knowledge discovery and user behaviour analysis. In a
typical sub-reddit forum, a user can use keywords and apply search tools to identify
relevant questions/answers or comments sent in by other reddit users. Moreover, a
registered user can create a topic or post a new question to start discussions with
other community members. In answering the questions, users reflect and share their
views and experiences. In these online forums, people may express their positive and
negative comments, or share questions, problems, and needs related to health issues.
By analysing these comments, we can identify valuable recommendations for improving health-services and understanding the problems of users.
In late December 2019, the outbreak of a novel coronavirus causing COVID-19
was reported [1]. Due to the rapid spread of the virus, the World Health Organization
declared a state of emergency. In this paper, we focused on analysing COVID-19–
related comments to detect sentiment and semantic ideas relating to COVID-19 based
on the public opinions of people on reddit. Specifically, we used automated extraction
of COVID-19–related discussions from social media and a natural language process
(NLP) method based on topic modeling to uncover various issues related to COVID19 from public opinions. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
– We present a systematic framework based on NLP that is capable of extracting
meaningful topics from COVID-19–related comments on reddit.
– We propose a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
for sentiment classification of COVID-19–related comments, which produces better results compared with several other well-known machine-learning methods.
– We detect and uncover meaningful topics that are being discussed on COVID19–related issues on reddit, as primary research.
– We calculate the polarity of the COVID-19 comments related to sentiment and
opinion analysis from 10 sub-reddits.
Our findings shed light on the importance of using public opinions and suitable computational techniques to understand issues surrounding COVID-19 and to guide related decision-making. Overall, the paper is structured as follows. First, we provide
a brief introduction to online healthcare forums. Discussion of COVID-19–related
issues and some similar works is provided in section 2. In section 3, we describe
the data pre-processing methods adopted in our research, and the NLP and deeplearning methods applied to the COVID-19 comments database. Next, we present the
results and discussion. Finally, we conclude and discuss future works based on NLP
approaches for analysing the online community in relation to the topic of COVID-19.

2 Related Work
Machine and deep-learning approaches based on sentiment and semantic analysis are
popular methods of analysing text-content in online health forums. Many researchers
have used these methods on social media such as Twitter, reddit [2] - [7], and health
information websites [8], [9]. For example; Halder and colleagues [10] focused on
exploring linguistic changes to analyse the emotional status of a user over time.
They utilized a recurrent neural network (RNN) to investigate user-content in a huge
dataset from the mental-health online forums of healthboards.com. McRoy and colleagues [11] investigated ways to automate identification of the information needs of
breast cancer survivors based on user-posts of online health forums. Chakravorti and
colleagues [12] extracted topics based on various health issues discussed in online
forums by evaluating user posts of several subreddits (e.g., r/Depression, r/Anxiety)
from 2012 to 2018. VanDam and colleagues [13] presented a classification approach
for identifying clinic-related posts in online health communities. For that dataset, the
authors collected 9576 thread-initiating posts from WebMD, which is a health information website.
The COVID-19–related comments from an online healthcare-oriented group can
be considered potentially useful for extracting meaningful topics to better understand
the opinions and highlight discussions of people/users and improve health strategies.
Although there are similar works regarding various health issues in online forums, to
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize NLP methods to evaluate
COVID-19–related comments from sub-reddit forums. We propose utilizing the NLP
technique based on topic modeling algorithms to automatically extract meaningful
topics and design a deep-learning model based on LSTM RNN for sentiment classi-

fication on COVID-19 comments and to understand the positive or negative opinions
of people as they relate to COVID-19 issues to inform relevant decision-making.

3 Framework Methodology
This section clarifies the methods used to investigate the main contributions to this
study, which proposes the use of an unsupervised topic model, with a collaborative
deep-learning model based on LSTN RNN to analyse COVID-19–related comments
from sub-reddits. The developed framework, shown in Fig. 2, uses sentiment and
semantic analysis for mining and opinion analysis of COVID-19–related comments.

3.1 Preparing the input data
Reddit is an American social media, a discussion website for various topics that includes web content ratings. In this social media, users are able to post questions
and comments, and to respond to each other regarding different subjects, such as
COVID-19. The posts are organised by subjects created by online users, called ”subreddits”, which cover a variety of topics like news, science, healthcare, video, books,
fitness, food, and image-sharing. This website is an ideal source for collecting healthrelated information about COVID-19–related issues. This paper focuses on COVID19–related comments of 10 sub-reddits based on an existing dataset as the first step
in producing this model.

3.2 Removing Noise and Stop-words
One of the most important steps in pre-processing COVID-19–related comments is
removing useless words/data, which are defined as stop-words in NLP, from pure
text. Moreover, we also decreased the dimensionality of the features space by eliminating stop-words. For example, the most common words in the text comments are
words that are usually meaningless and do not effectively influence the output, such
as articles, conjunctions, pronouns, and linking verbs. Some examples include: am,
is, are, they, the, these, I, that, and, them.

3.3 Semantic Extraction and COVID-19 Comment Mining
Text-document modeling in NLP is a practical technique that represents an individual document and the set of text-documents based on terms appearing in the textdocuments. Topic modeling based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [14] is one
type of document modelling approach. As a third step, we utilized topic modeling
based on an LDA Topic model and Gibbs sampling [15] for semantic extraction and
latent topic discovery of COVID-19–related comments. COVID-19 comments, however, can depend on various subjects that are discussed by reddit users. In this step
we can detect and discover these meaningful subjects or topics. Therefore, based

on the LDA model, we considered a collection of documents, such as COVID-19–
related comments and words, as topics (K), where the discrete topic distributions
are drawn from a symmetric Dirichlet distribution. The probability of observed data
D was computed and obtained from every COVID-19–related comment in a corpus
using the following equation:

Determined α parameters of topic Dirichlet prior and also considered parameters
of word Dirichlet prior as β. M is the number of text-documents, and N is the vocabulary size. Moreover,(α, θ) was determined for the corpus-level topic distributions
with a pair of Dirichlet multinomials. (β, ϕ) was also determined for the topic-word
distributions with a pair of Dirichlet multinomials. In addition, the document-level
variables were defined as θ d , which may be sampled for each document. The wordlevel variables zdn , wdn , were sampled in each text-document for each word [14].

Algorithm 2 describes a general process as part of our framework for extracting
latent topics and semantic mining. The input data consists of the number of COVID19–related comments as the context of the document: Line 1 processes the pure-data
to eliminate noise and stop-words based on Algorithm 1. Lines 2-5 compute the probability of the word distribution from Topic K[i]. Lines 6-11 compute the probability of
the topic distribution from the COVID-19-Content-Document m [i]. As highlighted
in Equation 1, the variables θm , wn are computed for document-level and word-level
of the framework. In more detail, the LDA handles topics as multinomial distributions
in documents and words as a probabilistic mixture of a pre-determined number from
latent topics. Lines 1-3 of Algorithm 3 show the semantic mining to extract the latent
topics. We then used a sorting function to determine the recommended highlighted
topics. Because the Gibbs sampling method is used in this step, the time requested for
model inference can be specified as the sum of the time for inferring LDA. Therefore,
the time complexity for LDA is O(N K), where N denotes the total size of the corpus
(COVID-19–related comments) and K is the topic number.

3.4 Deep-Learning and Sentiment Classification
Deep neural networks have been successfully employed for different types of machinelearning tasks, such as NLP-based methods utilizing sentiment aspects for deep classification [16] - [21]. Deep neural networks are able to model high-level abstractions
and to decrease the dimensions by utilizing multiple processing layers based on complex structures or to be combined with non-linear transformations. RNNs are popular
models with demonstrated importance and strength in most NLP works [22] - [24].
The purpose of RNNs is to use consecutive information, and the output is augmented
by storing previous calculations. In fact, RNNs are equipped with a memory function
that saves formerly calculated information. Basic RNNs, however, have some challenges due to gradient vanishing or exploding, and they are unable to learn long-term
dependencies. LSTM [25], [26] units have the benefit of being able to avoid this challenge by adjusting the information in a cell state using 3 different gates. The formula
for each LSTM cell can be formalized as:
ft = σ(W f z zt−1 + W f x xt + b f )

(2)

it = σ(Wiz zt−1 + Wix xt + bi )

(3)

ot = σ(Woz zt−1 + Wox xt + bo )

(4)

The forget ( ft ), input (it ), and output (ot ) gates for each LSTM cell are determined by these 3 equations, eqs. 2-4, respectively. In an LSTM layer, the forget gate
determines which previous information from the cell state is forgotten. The input gate
controls or determines the new information that is saved in the memory cell. The output gate controls or determines the amount of information in the internal memory cell
to be exposed. The cell-memory/input block equations are:
et = φ(Wcz zt−1 + Wcx xt + bc )
C
C t = it

et + ft

(7)

In which, Ci is the cell state, zt is the hidden output, and xt is an input vector. W
and b are the weight matrix and the bias term respectively. σ is sigmoid and φ is tanh.
is element-wise multiplication.
As the last step of this framework, an LSTM model was utilised to assess the
COVID-19–related comments of online users who posted on reddit, in order to recognize the emotion/sentiment elicited from these comments. We designed two LSTMlayers and for pre-trained embeddings, considered the Glove-50 dimension 1 , which
were trained over a large corpus of COVID-19–related comments (Figure 3). The processed text from the COVID-19–related comments, however, is changed to vectors
with a fixed dimension by converting pre-trained embeddings. Moreover, COVID19 comments can also be described as a characters-sequence with its corresponding
dimension creating a matrix [27].

4 Experiment Details
In this section, we provide a detailed description of the data collection and experimental results followed by a comprehensive discussion of the results. We assessed
563,079 COVID-19–related comments from reddit. The dataset was collected between January 20, 2020 and March 19, 2020 (the full dataset is available at Kaggle
website2 ). We used MALLET3 to implement the inference and capture the LDA topic
model to retrieve latent topics. We used the Python library Keras 4 to implement our
deep-learning model.

Fig. 5: Word cloud visualisation based on the word-weight of the topics.

According to Table 1 and 2 and Figures 4-8, the following observations were
made: Topics 85 and 18 had a similar concept in “People/Infection”. Topic 85 included words referring to people, such as ”people”, ”virus”, ”day”, ”bad”, ”stop”,
”news”, ”worse”, ”sick”, ”spread”, and ”family”. This topic is the first ranked topic
discovered from the generated latent topics, in which most users express their opinion and comment on this issue. Based on Table 1 and Figure 5 (a) in this topic, the
terms “people” and “virus” were the most highlighted words, with word-weights of
0.1295% and 0.0301%, respectively. Also, we can see the importance of the term
”family” from this topic. In addition, Topic 18 contains the telling words ”virus”,
”people”, ”symptoms”, ”infection”, ”cases”, ”disease”, ”pneumonia”, ”coronavirus”,
and ”treatment”. Other revealing words in Topic 18 included ”people”, ”infection”,
and ”treatment”. These terms initially suggest a set of user comments about treatment
issues. Moreover, the sentiment analysis of the terms suggest that negative words
were more highlighted than positive words.

Topic 63 also addresses healthcare and hospital issues with the most frequent
term being “hospital”. Words such as ”hospital”, ”medical”, ”healthcare”, ”patients”,
”care”, and ”city” were included. The terms “hospital”, “medical”, and “healthcare”
were the most highlighted words, with word-weights of 0.0561%, 0.0282%, and
0.0278%, respectively. Other words worth mentioning that were seen for this topic
were “person”, “patient”, “staff”, “workers”, and “emergency”. Topic 63 was assigned as medical staff issues. Topic 4 included words relating to money, such as
”pay”, ”money”, ”companies”, ”insurance”, ”paid”, ”free”, ”cost”, ”tax”, ”years”,
and ”employees”. Moreover, the sentiment analysis of the terms suggested that negative words were more highlighted than positive words.
Topic 30 covers user’s comments concerning issues related to ”feelings and hopes”
and highlight words such as ”good”, ”hope”, ”feel”, ”house”, ”safe”, ”hard”, ”months”,
”fine”, ”live”, and ”friend”. Moreover, sentiment analysis of terms suggested that

positive words were more highlighted than negative words. Positive words such as
“good”, “hope”, “safe”, “fine”, “kind”, and “friend”, thus pertain to the phenomenon
of “positive feelings”. For Topic 93, we can see that there was a clear focus on ”people, age, and COVID issues” with the top words being ”covid”, ”young”, ”risk”,
”fever”, ”immune”, ”age”, ”sick”, ”cough”, ”life”, ”cold”, ”elderly”, and ”older”.
The terms “covid”, “young”, and “risk” were the most highlighted words, with wordweights of 0.0299%, 0.0222%, and 0.0218%, respectively, and this topic had negative
polarity.
Topic 48 also addresses ”COVID-19 testing issues” and contains words like ”people”, ”testing”, ”government”, ”country”, ”tested”, ”test”, ”infected”, ”home”, ”covid”,
and ”pandemic”. Based on the results, the terms ”people” and ”testing” were the most
highlighted words with word weights of 0.0447% and 0.0337%, respectively. Moreover, the opinion words based on sentiment analysis scored high in negative polarity
for Topic 17. The top terms of this topic were “coronavirus”, ”quarantine”, ”stupid”,

”quarantine issues”. The terms ”coronavirus” and ”quarantine” were the most highlighted words, with word-weights of 0.0353% and 0.0346%, respectively.
4.1 Sentiment and Polarity results
Sentiment analysis is a practical technique in NLP for opinion mining that can be
used to classify text/comments based on word polarities [28] - [30]. This technique
has many applications in various disciplines, such as opinion mining in online healthcare communities [31] - [33]. We obtained the sentiment of the COVID-19–related
comments using the SentiStrength algorithm [34] - [36]. Therefore, with all COVID19–related comments tagged with sentiment scores, we calculated the average sentiment of the entire dataset along with comments mentioning only 10 COVID-19
sub-reddits. The main objective of this analysis was to identify the overall sentiment

For each of the polar comments in our labelled dataset, we assigned negative and
positive scores utilizing SentiStrength, and employed the various scores directly as
rules for building inference about the polarity/sentiment of the COVID-19 comments.
Based on SentiStrength, we determined that a comment was positive if the positive
sentiment score was greater than the negative sentiment score, and also considered
a similar rule for determining a positive sentiment. For example, a score of +5 and
-4 indicates positive polarity and a score of +4 and -6 indicates negative polarity.
Moreover, If the sentiment scores were equal (such as -1 and +1, +4 and -4), we
determined that the comment was neutral.

4.2 Deep classification and Feature Analysis
To prepare the dataset to automatically classify the sentiment of the COVID-19 comments for all of the data, we labelled each of the comments as very positive, positive, very negative, negative, and neutral based on the sentiment score obtained using the Sentistrength method. The training set had 338,666 COVID-19–related comments and the testing set had 112,888 comments. In this experiment, we evaluated
the proposed LSTM-model and also supervised machine-learning methods using the
Support Vector Machine (Senti-ML1), Naive Bayes (Senti-ML2), Logistic Regression (Senti-ML3), K Nearest Neighbors (Senti-ML4) techniques. Figure 4 shows
the accuracy of the best model for classifying a COVID-19 comment as either a
very positive, positive, very negative, negative, or neutral sentiment. Our approach
based on the LSTM model, which classified all COVID-19 comments in the majority
class achieved 81.15% accuracy, which was higher than that of traditional machinelearning algorithms. We believe that the sentiment and semantic techniques can provide meaningful results with an overview of how users/people feel about the disaster.

5 Discussion and Practical Findings
Analysing social media comments on platforms such as reddit could provide meaningful information for understanding people’s opinions, which might be difficult to
achieve through traditional techniques, such as manual methods. The text content on
reddit has been analysed in various studies [37] - [39]; to the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study to analyse comments by considering semantic and sentiment
aspects of COVID-related comments from reddit for online health communities.
Overall, we extended the analysis to check whether we could find a dependency
of semantic aspects of user-comments for different issues on COVID-19–related topics. In this case, we considered an existing dataset that included 563,079 comments
from 10 sub-reddits. We found and detected meaningful latent topics of terms about
COVID-19 comments related to various issues. Thus, user comments proved to be
a valuable source of information, as shown in Tables 1 and 2 and Figures 4-8. A
variety of different visualisations was used to interpret the generated LDA results.
As mentioned, LDA is a probabilistic model that, when applied to documents, hypothesises that each document from a collection has been generated as a mixture of

unobserved (latent) topics, where a topic is defined as a categorical distribution over
words. Regarding the top-ranked topics for the COVID-19 comments, it is possible
to recognise many words probably related to needs and highlight-discussions of the
people or users on reddit.
This research was limited to English-language text, which was considered a selection criterion. Therefore, the results do not reflect comments made in other languages. In addition, this study was limited to comments retrieved from January 20,
2020 and March 19, 2020. Therefore, the gap between the period in which the research was being completed and the time-frame of our study may have somewhat
affected the timeliness of our results. Overall, the study suggests that the systematic
framework by combining NLP and deep-learning methods based on topic modelling
and an LSTM model enabled us to generate some valuable information from COVID19–related comments. These kinds of statistical contributions can be useful for determining the positive and negative actions of an online community, and to collect user
opinions to help researchers and clinicians better understand the behaviour of people
in a critical situation. Regarding future work, we plan to evaluate other social media,
such as Twitter, using hybrid fuzzy deep-learning techniques [40] - [41] that can be
used in the future for sentiment level classification as a novel method of retrieving
meaningful latent topics from public comments.

6 CONCLUSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyse the association between COVID19 comments’sentiment and semantic topics on reddit. The main goal of this paper,
however, was to show a novel application for NLP based on an LSTM model to detect meaningful latent-topics and sentiment-comment-classification on COVID-19–
related issues from healthcare forums, such as sub-reddits. We believe that the results
of this paper will aid in understanding the concerns and needs of people with respect
to COVID-19–related issues. Moreover, our findings may aid in improving practical
strategies for public health services and interventions related to COVID-19.
