Abstract:

30

Efficacious interventions are urgently needed for the treatment of COVID-19. Here, we report

31

a monoclonal antibody (mAb), MW05, showing high SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity by

32

disrupting the interaction of receptor binding domain (RBD) with angiotensin-converting

33

enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Crosslinking of Fc with FcγRIIB mediates antibody-dependent

34

enhancement (ADE) activity by MW05. This activity was eliminated by introducing the LALA

35

mutation to the Fc region (MW05/LALA). Most importantly, potent prophylactic and

36

therapeutic effects against SARS-CoV-2 were observed in rhesus monkeys. A single dose of

37

MW05/LALA completely blocked the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in a study of its prophylactic

38

effect and totally cleared SARS-CoV-2 in three days in a treatment setting. These results pave

39

the way for the development of MW05/LALA as an effective strategy for combating COVID-

40

19.

42

COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is currently spreading globally, threatening human

43

health and economic development 1,2. As of July 27, 2020, COVID-19 has resulted in more than

44

16 million infections and 647,784 deaths. Although, multiple clinical trials are ongoing to

45

evaluate repurposing anti-viral and anti-inflammatory agents, no specific treatment against

46

SARS-CoV-2 has been approved since the worldwide outbreak began six months ago 3.

47

Treatments using plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients have shown clear clinical

48

improvement of both mild and severe cases of COVID-19, indicating that passive

49

administration of neutralizing mAbs could have a major impact on controlling the SARS-CoV-

RBD recombinant protein. We used this protein as bait to isolate specific memory B cells from

65

peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a COVID-19 convalescent patient. We then

66

used a single B cell cloning strategy to amplify the variable regions of IgG antibodies from

characterized. Two mAbs, MW05 and MW07, showed high RBD binding abilities and strong

70

RBD/ACE2 disrupting activities in ELISA. IC50 was determined to be 0.054 µg/mL for MW05

71

and 0.037 µg/mL for MW07. (Fig. 1 A to C). FACS analysis showed that both mAbs could

72

specifically bind to SARS-CoV-2 S protein expressed on HEK293 cells (Fig. 1D). The

73

dissociation constants (Kd) of MW05 and MW07 binding to SARS-CoV-2 S1 recombinant

74

protein was measured by a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. Kd was 0.403 nM for

75

MW05 and 0.462 nM for MW07 (Fig.1E). No cross reactivity with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV

76

S1 recombinant proteins was detected for either mAb, as assessed using ELISA (Fig. 1 F).

77

SARS-CoV-2 raced around the world after its initial outbreak. Over the past few months it has

78

been mutating. We next expressed RBD recombinant proteins from eight SARS-CoV-2 strains

79

with reported high-frequency mutations. Binding assays showed that both MW05 and MW07

80

exhibited the same binding abilities to all RBD recombinant proteins. This result suggests that

81

MW05 and MW07 may neutralize all eight of these strains (Fig. 1G; Extended Data Fig. 1).

14

. A large panel of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding mAbs were generated and

82

To investigate the neutralizing activities of MW05 and MW07, we used in vitro assays to

83

assess neutralization of first pseudovirus bearing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and then

84

authentic virus. Both MW05 and MW07 inhibited pseudovirus infection of Huh7 cells

85

effectively. NT50 was measured as 0.030 μg/ml for MW05 and 0.063 μg/ml for MW07 (Fig. 2,

A and B). We further evaluated the neutralizing activities of these two mAbs with authentic

87

SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells. As expected, MW05 and MW07 blocked authentic

88

SARS-CoV-2 entry into Vero E6 cells, with 100% neutralization titer (NT100) around 1 μg/ml

89

for MW05 and 5 μg/ml for MW07 (Fig. 2, C and D). In summary, MW05 and MW07 exhibited

90

substantial neutralization of both SARS-Cov-2 pseudovirus and authentic virus.

91

ADE has been observed for coronaviruses and several publications have shown that sera

92

induced by SARS-CoV S protein enhanced viral entry into immune cells and inflammation 15,16.

93

To evaluate ADE activities of MW05 and MW07, we assessed the infection of SARS-CoV-2

94

pseudovirus and mAbs complex in THP-1, K562 and Raji cells. These cells are resistant to

95

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, as they do not express ACE2 receptor (Extended Data Fig.

96

2). Cells were incubated with the mixture of pseudovirus with serially diluted MW05. Enhanced

97

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of Raji cells, but not of THP-1 o K562 cells was observed

98

(Fig. 3A). Interestingly, No ADE activity was detected for MW07 on all three cell lines (Fig.

99

3B). Next, we determined the FcγR expression profile of the three cell lines. FACS data

100

revealed that Raji cells, which showed ADE activity for MW05, only express a relatively high

101

level of FcγRIIB; THP-1 cells express high levels of FcγRIA and FcγRIIA; and K562 cells only

102

express high level of FcγRIIA (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that FcγRIIB is the major FcγR

103

contributing to the enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection mediated by MW05.

104

To further assess the ADE activities of MW05, we pre-incubated Raji cells along with

105

irrelevant hIgG1 or MW05 along with FcγRIA recombinant protein to disrupt the interaction of

106

MW05 Fc with FcγRIIB on Raji cells. Both pre-incubation strategies effectively inhibited the

107

ADE activities of MW05 (Fig.3 D and E). FcγRIA has high affinity for the Fc of human IgG1.

108

Accordingly, pre-incubation of MW05 with FcγRIA recombinant protein showed higher ADE

109

inhibition than did pre-incubation of irrelevant hIgG1with Raji cells by disruption of MW05 Fc

110

with with FcγRIIB on Raji cells (Fig.3 D and E).

111

mediated acute lung injury in vivo, we introduced the LALA mutation to the Fc region of MW05

112

(MW05/LALA) to decrease the engagement of MW05 with FcγRs. This mutation completely

113

eliminated ADE activity of MW05 without decreasing its neutralizing activity (Fig. 3 F and G).

114

We evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of MW05/LALA in a rhesus monkey

115

SARS-CoV-2 infection model. In the prophylactic (pre-challenge) group, three animals were

116

injected intravenously with a single dose of MW05/LALA (20 mg/kg) one day before receiving

117

a 1×105 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) SARS-CoV-2 challenge via intratracheal

118

incubation (Fig. 4A). MW05/LALA antibody effectively protected animals from SARS-CoV-2

119

infection; almost no virus was detected in the oropharyngeal swabs of the prophylactic group

120

(Fig. 4B).

To eliminate the risk of ADE and Fc-

121

In the treatment (post-challenge) group, three animals were first challenged with 1×105

122

TCID50 SARS-CoV-2. Then, at day 1 post infection (dpi), a single dose of MW05/LALA (40

123

mg/kg) was administered intravenously to these animals (Fig. 4A). Animals in the control group

124

(n=3) were given a single dose of irrelevant hIgG1 (20 mg/kg) on 1 dpi. In the control group,

125

the viral loads in oropharyngeal swabs increased to a peak of about 107.0 RNA copies/mL on 4

126

dpi, then decreased to the limit of detection on 7 dpi (Fig. 4B). Virus was only detected in the

127

rectal swabs of two animals in the control group (Fig. 4C). Notably, virus titers decreased in

128

the MW05/LALA treatment group immediately after administration. No virus was detected in

129

the MW05/LALA treatment group even on 4 dpi, the time point at which viral titers in the

130

control group reached their peak. A single dose of MW05/LALA exhibited SARS-CoV-2

131

therapeutic efficacy in a rhesus monkey model, clearing virus in three days after antibody

132

administration (Fig. 4B). No significant weight loss or body temperature change was observed

133

in any of the animals during the study (Extended Data Fig. 3 and 4). No virus was detected in

134

nasal swabs or blood samples (Extended Data Fig. 5). Additionally, no significant abnormal

135

hematology changes were observed (Extended Data Fig. 6).

136

Rhesus monkeys challenged with SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated for tissue damage. One

137

monkey from each group was euthanized for necropsy on 6 and 7 dpi. Interstitial pneumonia

138

symptoms were observed in the control group, including thickened alveolar septa, intensive

139

infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes, and proliferation of fibroblasts (Fig. 4D). We also

140

observed cellulose exudation in some alveolar cavities, with the formation of hyaline membrane

141

and pulmonary hemorrhaging (Fig. 4D). Monkeys in treatment group displayed limited

142

pathological lung changes, with overall alveolar structure intact and much lower levels of

143

fibroblasts proliferation and leukocyte infiltration than were observed in the control monkeys

144

(Fig. 4D). No lesions were observed in the lungs of the animal euthanized on 6 dpi and very

145

mild pulmonary hemorrhaging of the animal euthanized on 7 dpi in the prophylactic group (Fig.

146

4D). In summary, MW05/LALA effectively inhibited lung tissue damage in both prophylactic

147

and therapeutic ways in a rhesus monkey SARS-CoV-2 infection model.

148

Immunohistochemical analysis of virus in lung tissues showed that SARS-CoV-2 protein

149

only been detected in the lung tissue of the control group on 5 dpi but not 6 dpi and 7 dpi. In

150

comparison, viral proteins were undetectable in the lung tissues of animals in the prophylactic

151

and therapeutic groups (Fig. 4E). In order to further understand the distribution of SARS-CoV7 / 28

2 in upper respiratory tract, trachea and bronchus tissue samples were collected on 6 dpi and 7

153

dpi. Viral titers were then determined by qRT-PCR. On 6 dpi and 7 dpi, high levels of SARS-

154

CoV-2 RNA copies were detected in trachea and bronchi tissues of control animals, while no

155

viral nucleic acid was detected from tissue samples of both prophylactic and therapeutic groups

156

(Fig. 4F).

157

The global COVID-19 pandemic is running rampant over the world. There are great unmet

158

medical needs for COVID-19 therapy as no SARS-CoV-2 specific drugs or vaccines have yet

159

been approved. Neutralizing mAbs are promising agents to combat emerging infectious

160

diseases. Our results showed the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of MW05/LALA on

161

SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. This work paves the way for further development of antibody-based

162

therapies for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of COVID-19.

231

MX488AS100-1KT, Sigma-Aldrich) were added into cells (1×106 cells/sample in 100 μL) and

232

incubated for 60 min at 2-6℃ and analyzed using flow cytometry (CytoFLEX, Beckman Coulter).

233
234

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR). SPR measurements were performed at room temperature using

235

a BIAcore S200 system with CM4 biosensor chips (GE Healthcare). For all measurements, a buffer

236

consisting of 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 3 mM EDTA, pH 7.4 and 0.005% (v/v) Tween-20 was

237

used as running buffer. All proteins were exchanged into this buffer in advance. The blank channel

238

of the chip served as the negative control. SARS-CoV-2 S1 recombinant protein was captured on

239

the chip at 175 response units. Gradient concentrations of MW05 Fab or MW07 Fab (from 200 nM

240

to 6.25 nM with 2-fold dilution) were then flowed over the chip surface. After each cycle, the sensor

241

was regenerated with Gly-HCl (pH 1.5). The affinity was calculated using a 1:1 (Rmax Local fit)

242

binding fit model with BIAevaluation software.

243
244

Neutralization assay. SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was prepared and provided by the Institute for

245

Biological Product Control, National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC) 18. The TCID50

246

was determined by the transduction of pseudovirus into Huh7 cells. For pseudovirus neutralization

247

assay, 100 µL of mAbs at different concentrations were mixed with 50 µL supernatant containing

248

500 TCID50 pseudovirus. The mixture was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, supplied with 5% CO2.

249

All mAbs were tested in concentrations ranging from 0.55 ng/mL to 28 µg/mL in the context of

250

Huh7 cells. 100 µL of Huh7 cell suspension (2 × 105 cells/mL) was then added to the mixtures of

251

pseudoviruses and mAbs for an additional 24 h incubation at 37 °C. Then, 150 μL of supernatant

252

was removed, and 100 μL luciferase detecting regents (Promega) was added to each well. After 2

253

mins incubation, each well was mixed 10 times by pipetting, and 150 μL of the mixture was

254

transferred to a new microplate. Luciferase activity was measured using a microplate luminometer

255

(ThermoFisher). The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) was calculated using GraphPad Prism 7.0. For

256

SARS-CoV-2 authentic virus neutralization assay, Vero E6 cells were diluted and seeded into a 96-

257

well plate with 1×104 cells/well in 100 µL volume at 37 °C. 16 h later, cells were washed by 1× PBS

258

for 3 times and added diluted antibodies in equal volume with the concentration ranging from 0.1

259

μg/mL to 100 μg/mL. 100 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 authentic virus was used for each well. Meanwhile,

260

a control group without antibody was set up. A virus back-titration was performed to assess the

261

correct virus titer used in each experiment. Cytopathic effect of each well was monitored every day

262

and photographed at day 3 or day 4 after virus infection. All experiments were conducted following

263

the standard operating procedures of the approved BSL-3 facility.

264
265

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) assay. The ADE assays were performed using Raji,

266

THP-1 and K562 cell lines. 25 µL of 2-fold serially diluted mAbs were mixed with 25 µL

267

supernatant containing 250 TCID50 pseudovirus. The mixture was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C,

268

supplied with 5% CO2. All mAbs were tested in the concentrations ranging from 6000 to 23.4 ng/mL.

269

100 µL of THP-1, Raji and K562 cells at the density of 2 × 106 cells/mL were added to the mixtures

270

of pseudoviruses and mAbs for an additional 24 h incubation. Then, same volume of luciferase

Animal experiments. All animal experiments were performed according to the procedures

275

approved by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and complied with all relevant ethical regulations

276

regarding animal research. Nine 6 or 7 year-old rhesus monkeys (3 females and 6 males) were

277

divided into 3 groups: a control group (one female and two males), a pre-exposure group (one female

278

and two males) and a post-exposure group (one female and two males). Rhesus monkeys in the

279

control group were injected with 20 mg/kg negative control antibody. For the prophylactic study,

280

monkeys in the pre-exposure group were given a single dose of 20 mg/kg MW05/LALA antibody

281

intravenously one day before being challenged with 1×105 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 via intratracheal

282

routes. For the therapeutic study, monkeys in the post-exposure group were administrated with a

283

single dose of 40 mg/kg MW05/LALA antibody intravenously one day after challenged with 1×105

284

TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 via intratracheal routes. Body weight and body temperature were monitored

285

every day. Oropharyngeal, nasal and rectal swabs were collected for 7 days. Blood samples were

286

collected. White blood cells (WBC), neutrophils (NEUT), lymphocytes (LYMPH) and monocytes

287

(MONO) were assessed for all monkeys. Swabs were placed into 1 mL of DMEM after collection.
