Abstract
Spike (S) proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are critical determinants of the infectivity
and antigenicity of the virus. Several mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have already been detected, and their
effect in immune system evasion and enhanced transmission as a cause of increased morbidity and mortality are being
investigated. From pathogenic and epidemiological perspectives, spike proteins are of prime interest to researchers. This
study focused on the unique variants of S proteins from six continents Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, South America, and
North America. In comparison to the other five continents, Africa (29.065%) had the highest percentage of unique S proteins.
Notably, only North America had 87% (14046) of the total (16143) specific S proteins available in the NCBI database(across
all continents). Based on the amino acid frequency distributions in the S protein variants from all the continents, the
phylogenetic relationship implies that unique S proteins from North America were significantly different from those of the
other five continents. Overtime, the unique variants originating from North America are most likely to spread to the other
geographic locations through international travel or naturally by emerging mutations. Hence it is suggested that restriction of
international travel should be considered, and massive vaccination as an utmost measure to combat the spread of COVID-19
pandemic. It is also further suggested that the efficacy of existing vaccines and future vaccine development must be reviewed
with careful scrutiny, and if needed, further re-engineered based on requirements dictated by new emerging S protein variants.

1. Introduction
The world is experiencing a health emergency due to Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by a deadly enveloped
positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
The spike (S) protein is a homotrimer present on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 and recognizes the human host cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) [7, 8, 9, 10]. From the beginning of the second wave of COVID-19
infection, various SARS-CoV-2 variants variants emerged raising concern of enhanced transmission and mortality of the virus
and reduced efficacy of vaccine protection [11, 12]. Some of the studies opposed the perception of SARS-CoV-2 mutations
as distinctive pathogenic variants and increased rate of transmissibility were questioned [13, 14]. However, the frequency of
the mutant strains within the SARS-CoV-2 population carrying the D614G mutation in the spike protein clearly plays a
role in enabling the virus to spread more effectively and rapidly [15]. Epidemiologists have been constantly monitoring the
evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with a particular focus on the spike protein and other interacting proteins of the virus [15, 16].
The D614G mutation in the S protein discovered in early 2020 makes the virus able to spread more effectively and rapidly
[17]. The D614G mutation has been found to be related with high viral loads in infected patients, and high rate of infections,
but not with increased disease severity [18]. Various mutations in the S protein make the SARS-CoV-2 more complex and
hence it is more difficult to characterize its severity, infectivity and efficacy of vaccines designed to target S protein. Not all
mutations are advantageous to the virus but several mutations or a set of mutations may increase the transmission potential
through an increase in receptor binding or the ability to evade the host immune response by altering the surface structures
recognized by antibodies [19, 20, 21].
To contain the spread of the COVID-19, it is definitely of high interest to detect and identify various unique emerging
variants of S proteins. Additionally, it is also worth investigating the impact of new S protein variants on viral infectivity
and potential to spread rapidly as well as to acertain the origin of the spread of the new variants concerning spike protein
variabilities. Accordingly, it might be possible to segregate the set of new variants with respect to individual characteristics
of SARS-CoV-2, which would undoubtedly help policy makers to form various strategies to contain the spread of the virus.
There are a large number of different SARS-CoV-2 S protein mutant sequences currently available in the NCBI virus database.
In this study, all available S protein sequences from six continents Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America, and
Oceania were analyzed for their uniqueness and variability. An inter-linkage was made among the unique S proteins available
on the six continents was performed.
2. Data acquisition and methods
S protein sequences from all six continents (Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, South America, and North America) were
downloaded in Fasta format (on May 7, 2021) from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Further, fasta files were processed in Matlab-2021a for extracting unique S protein sequences
for each continent.
2.1. Frequency probability of amino acids
Any protein sequence is composed of twenty different amino acids with various frequencies starting from zero. The
i)
where f (Ai ) denotes the frequency of
probability of occurrence of each amino acid Ai is determined by the formula f (A
l
occurrence of the amino acid Ai in a primary sequence, and l stands as the length of an S protein [22]. Hence for each S
protein, a twenty-dimensional vector considering the frequency probability of twenty amino acids can be obtained. Based on
this frequency probability, the dominance of amino acid density in a given protein is illuminated.
2.2. Evaluation of normalized amino acid compositions
The variability of the amino acid compositions of the unique S-proteins from each continent was evaluated using the webbased tool Composition Profiler (http://www.cprofiler.org/ ) that automates detection of enrichment or depletion patterns of
individual amino acids or groups of amino acids in query proteins [23]. In this analysis, we used sets of unique S-proteins
from each continent as query samples and the amino acid of the original S-protein (UniProt ID: P0DTC2) as a reference
sample that provides the background amino acid distribution. Composition profiler generates a bar chart composed of twenty
data points (one for each amino acid), where bar heights indicate normalized enrichment or depletion of a given residue. The
normalized enrichment/depletion is calculated as
Ccontinent − Coriginal
Coriginal
where Ccontinent is the content of given residue in the query set of S-proteins in a given continent and Coriginal is the content
of the same residue in the original S-protein. For comparison, we generated composition profile of disordered proteins, where
C
−CP DB
normalized composition was evaluated as Disprot
(CDisP rot = content of a given amino acid in the set of intrinsically
CP DB
disordered proteins in the DisProt database [24]; CP DB = content of the given residue in the dataset of fully ordered proteins,
PDB Select 25 [23]). In these analyses, the positive and negative values produced in the compositional profiler indicated
enrichment or depletion of the indicated residue, respectively.

2.3. Amino acid conservation Shannon entropy
How conserved/disordered the amino acids are organized over S protein is addressed by the information-theoretic measure
known as ’Shannon entropy(SE)’. For each S protein, Shannon entropy of amino acid conservation over the amino acid
sequence of S protein is computed using the following formula [25, 26]:
For a given amino acid sequence of length l, the conservation of amino acids is calculated as follows:
SE = −

20
X

psi log20 (psi )

i=1

where psi =

ki
l ;

ki represents the number of occurrences of an amino acid si in the given sequence [27].

2.4. Isoelectric point of a protein sequence
The isoelectric point (IP), is the pH at which a molecule carries no net electrical charge or is electrically neutral in the
statistical mean. We calculate the theoretical pI by using the pKa’s of amino acids and summing the net charge across the
protein at a given pH (default is typical intracellular pH 7.2), searching with our algorithm for the pH at which the net
charge is zero [28].
Note that the isoelectric point of a protein sequence was computed here using the standard routine of Matlab-2021a. This
parameter was deployed to characterize the unique S protein sequences, quantitatively.
3. Results
We first determined the set of unique S protein sequences from each continent. Further, every unique S protein from a
continent was compared with other unique S proteins from five continents, and the lists of the same are presented in Tables
12-17. Also, the variability of the S proteins from each continent was shown using Shannon entropy and isoelectric point.
3.1. Unique spike proteins in the continents
In Table 1, the number of total sequences, unique sequences and percentages are presented. Note that, a complete list
of unique S protein accessions and their names (continent-wise) were made available in supplementary file-1. Note that,
sequence accession is renamed as Ck where C stands for continent code (Asia:AS, Africa:AF, Oceania:O, Europe:U, South
America:SA and North America:NA), and k denotes the serial number.

The highest amount (29.065%) of unique S proteins were found in Africa though the total number of available sequences is
significantly low as compared with that from other continents. Almost similar amounts (in percentage) of unique S sequence
variations were found in Asia and Europe. Among the total 127760 S proteins embedded in SARS-CoV-2 genomes, only 16143
(12%) unique S proteins were detected so far, and notably most of the unique variants (87%) were found in North America only.
For each continent, the unique spike (S) proteins were matched with other unique proteins from the rest of the five
continents, and a total number of such identical pairs are presented accordingly in the matrix (Table 2).

From Table 2, it was observed that, in each continent there is still a significant percentage of unique spike variations
available, which are not shared with any rest of the continents. Such percentages of unique variations of S proteins in Asia,
Africa, Europe, Oceania, South America, and North America were 41%, 55%, 28%, 92%, 7%, and 97% respectively. The lists
of pairs of identical S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 originating from six continents are presented in Tables 9-11 (Appendix -I).
The lists of unique S proteins (from a particular continent), which were found to be identical with some unique spike
proteins from other five continents, are presented in Tables (12-17) (Appendix -II).
The frequency and percentage of invariant residue positions, where no amino acid change was detected so far in the unique
S proteins available in each continent, are presented in Table 3.

The highest number of mutations (lowest number of invariant residue position, 6.99%) (Table 3) were detected in the
unique S proteins from North America where 12.42% unique S protein sequences were present as mentioned in Table 1.
Likewise, the lowest number (15.95%) of mutations in unique S proteins were observed in South America where 15.3% unique
S sequences were found. Only 29.14% residues of 1273 in the unique S proteins were mutated, although a significantly higher
number (29.065%) of unique sequences were found in Africa among the other five continents. The unique S proteins from
Europe possessed only 25.5% mutations, whereas 45.5% mutations were detected in the unique S proteins from Asia although
the same percentage (18.5%) of unique spike proteins were found (Table 1 and 3). Further it was observed that 11.3% of the
unique S proteins from Oceania possessed 42.58% mutations.
3.2. Variability through normalized amino acid composition
Additional information on the variability of the amino compositions of the unique S-proteins from each continent relative to the composition of original S-protein from Wuhan was retrieved using the web-based tool Composition Profiler
(http://www.cprofiler.org/ ). Results of this analysis are shown in Figure 4A, which clearly shows the presence of some noticeable amino acid composition variability among unique S-proteins from different continents. Since individual S proteins
are different from each other and from the original S-protein mostly in very limited number of residues, the range of changes
in the normalized enrichment/depletion of a given residue is rather limited (compare scales of Y axis in Figures 1A and 1B,
where a composition profile of the intrinsically disordered proteins is shown for comparison).

Figure 1: Composition profiles of unique S-proteins from different continents (A) in comparison with the composition profile of typical intrinsically
disordered protein (B).

On an average, unique S-proteins form Oceania were found to have the most variability in terms of normalized amino acid
composition. This was followed by the unique S-proteins from North America. Curiously, Figure 1A shows that although
the normalized content of individual residues in the unique S-proteins from Oceania is always below that of the original
S-protein, S-proteins from other continents might have relative excess of some residues. For example, some unique S-proteins
from almost all continents can be enriched in glycine or histidine residues, whereas some European S-proteins can also be
relatively enriched in cysteine, isoleucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and lysine residues (see positive green bars in Figure
1A). Another interesting observation is that the different sets of S-proteins are typically characterized by rather noticeable
variability of the normalized content of most residues. The noticeable exception is given by aspartate, depletion in which is
almost uniform between all the unique S-proteins from all the continents.
3.3. Variability of unique spike proteins
We quantitatively determined the variations in the unique S proteins on six continents. The variations were captured
through the frequency distribution of amino acids present, Shannon entropy (amount of conservation of amino acids in a
given sequence), and molecular weights and isoelectric points of a given protein sequence.
3.3.1. Variations in the frequency distribution of amino acids
The frequency of each amino acid was computed for each unique S protein available in six continents (Supplementary
file-2 ). Maximum and minimum frequencies of amino acids present in the unique S proteins from different continents are
presented in Table 4.

All S protein sequences are leucine (L) and serine (S) rich. Tryptophan (W) and methionine (M) were presented with
the least frequencies (Table 4). The widest variation in frequency distributions of the twenty amino acids over the unique S
proteins was found in North America.
To obtain quantitative variations in the unique S proteins available in each continent, differences between maximum and
minimum vectors (20 dimensions) were obtained (Table 5), and then Euclidean distances between the difference vectors was
calculated (Table 6).

Figure 2: Phylogenetic relationship among the six continents based on the variability of unique spike proteins available in each continent.

Variations based on the frequency distribution of amino acids present in the S proteins make North America (which
belongs to the rightmost branch of the tree) distant from the other five continents (Figure 2). Variations among the unique
spike proteins from Asia and Oceania turned out to be similar, and they belong to the same level of leaves of the far left
branch of the tree. Africa and Europe were found to be the closest in terms of variations based on the frequency distribution
of amino acids over the unique spike proteins from each continent. Variability of spike proteins from South America has
distant resemblance to that of Africa/Europe as estimated in the phylogeny. The frequencies of amino acid distribution in
each unique S protein from each continent were plotted (Figure 3).

as wide band was observed in Figure 4. Individual frequency distributions of amino acids in Asia and Oceania seem very
close as it was observed from the phylogeny (Figure 2).
3.3.2. Variability through Shannon entropy
In principle, for a random amino acid sequence, the Shannon entropy (SE) is one. Here Shannon entropy for each S
protein sequence was computed using the formula stated in section 2.2 (Supplementary file-2 ). It was found that the highest
and lowest SEs of S proteins from all continents were 0.9643 and 0.9594 respectively. That is, the length of the largest
interval is 0.005 which is sufficiently small. Also note that the length of the smallest interval was 0.001 which occurred in
the SEs of S proteins from South America. Within this realm, the widest variation of SEs was noticed among the unique S
proteins of North America. All other four intervals (considering lowest and highest) of SEs of all the unique S proteins from
four continents Africa, Asia, Oceania and Europe were contained in the interval of North America and contain that of South
America.

Among all (201273 ) possible amino acids (20 in number) sequences of length 1273, Nature(?) had selected only a fraction
to make S proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and interestingly SEs of them were kept within a very small interval. From the SEs
which were close to 1, the S protein sequences are expected to be pseudo-random. Variation of SEs for all unique S proteins
from each continent is shown in Figures 5 and 6.

Conservation of amino acids present over each S protein from each continent is different from one another which is depicted
by the zig-zag nature of SEs plots (Figure 5 and 6).
3.3.3. Variability through isoelectric point
For each S protein sequence from each continent isoelectric point (IP) was computed (Supplementary file-3). Intervals
(considering minimum and maximum) IPs of unique spike proteins from each continent were tabulated in Table 8.

It was noticed that IPs for all the unique S proteins from the six continents were distributed in between 5.61 and 7.79.
The largest interval of IPs was found for the unique S proteins from North America. Therefore, the widest varieties of unique
S proteins were found in North America.

4. Discussion and concluding remarks
Various mutations in S proteins lead to the evolution of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 [29]. Naturally, our attention was
captured to characterize unique S protein variants which were embedded in SARS-CoV-2 genomes infecting millions people
worldwide [30]. As of May 7, 2021, there are 127760 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with 16143 S protein variants, which
undoubtedly well-organized by means of amino acids composition and conservation as it was depicted by Shannon entropy
and isoelectric point. Among the unique spike proteins present in a continent, many of them are common in other continents
as well (Table 2). On the other hand, there is still a handful of unique spike protein variants residing in each continent.
Considering the nature and biological implications of the new variants of SARS-CoV-2 caused by different mutations in S
proteins, the appearance of several unique S variants in SARS-CoV-2 is certainly an worrying event. [31]. There are still
many unique S protein variants in all continents that may spread from person to person through close communities or by
spontaneous mutations caused a condition that may become alarming.
We observed that unique S proteins from North America have mutations in almost every amino acid residue position (1184
out of 1273), while unique spike variants from the other continents only have mutations in 16 to 20% of residues. So, even
if international travel is limited, S proteins from these five continents will likely acquire mutations at other residue positions
where mutations have already been found in the specific variants from North America due to natural evolution. Based on the
amino acid frequency distributions in the S protein variants from all the continents, a phylogenetic relationship among the
continents was drawn. The phylogenetic relationship implies that unique S proteins from North America were found to be
significantly different from that of other five continents. Therefore, the possibility of spreading the unique variants originated
from North America to the other geographic locations by means of international travel is high, and numerous mutations
have been detected already in the unique variants from North America. Of note, South America infection/herd immunity
status may have summarized by Manaus city example (the capital of Amazonas state in northern Brazil) where by June 2020
to October 2020 SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among Manaus’ population increased from ¿60% to ¿70%, a condition which may
mirror acquisition of herd immunity [32]. By January 2021 Manaus had a huge resurgence in cases due to emergence of a
new variant known as P.1 which was responsible for nearly 100% of the new case [33]. Although the population may have
then reached a high herd immunity threshold, there is still a risk of resurgence of new immunity-escape variants, which raises
important questions. For example, Is post-infection herd immunity not enough for protection and should it be combined
with vaccination? 2. Will the crucial viral variants (mutations) be listed by WHO and recommended to be included in “next
generation vaccines”? [34, 35]. In addition, we cannot yet exclude the possibility of serious mutations in the viral RBD
emerging in India and the USA [34].
Hence in the near future, we can expect to experience more new SARS-CoV-2 variants which might cause third, fourth,
and fifth etc. waves of COVID-19. Therefore, massive vaccination is necessary to combat COVID-19, and of course, existing
vaccines must be reviewed, and if needed further re-engineered may be required based on newly emerging S protein variants.
