Summary

28

Coronaviruses are adept at evading host antiviral pathways induced by viral double-stranded

29

RNA, including interferon (IFN) signaling, oligoadenylate synthetase–ribonuclease L (OAS-

30

RNase L), and protein kinase R (PKR). While dysregulated or inadequate IFN responses have

31

been associated with severe coronavirus infection, the extent to which the recently emerged

32

SARS-CoV-2 activates or antagonizes these pathways is relatively unknown. We found that

33

SARS-CoV-2 infects patient-derived nasal epithelial cells, present at the initial site of infection,

34

induced pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar type 2 cells (iAT2), the major cell type infected in

35

the lung, and cardiomyocytes (iCM), consistent with cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19

36

disease. Robust activation of IFN or OAS-RNase L is not observed in these cell types, while PKR

37

activation is evident in iAT2 and iCM. In SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 and A549ACE2 lung-derived

38

cell lines, IFN induction remains relatively weak; however activation of OAS-RNase L and PKR is

39

observed. This is in contrast to MERS-CoV, which effectively inhibits IFN signaling as well as

40

OAS-RNase L and PKR pathways, but similar to mutant MERS-CoV lacking innate immune

41

antagonists. Remarkably, both OAS-RNase L and PKR are activated in MAVS knockout A549ACE2

42

cells, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can induce these host antiviral pathways despite minimal

43

IFN production. Moreover, increased replication and cytopathic effect in RNASEL knockout

44

A549ACE2 cells implicates OAS-RNase L in restricting SARS-CoV-2. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2

45

fails to antagonize these host defense pathways, which contrasts with other coronaviruses, the

46

IFN signaling response is generally weak. These host-virus interactions may contribute to the

47

unique pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.

severe COVID-19 diseases, understanding of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with host antiviral

infections in relevant respiratory tract derived cells and cardiomyocytes and found that SARS-

CoV-2 activates two antiviral pathways, oligoadenylate synthetase–ribonuclease L (OAS-RNase

Introduction

76

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 emerged in China in late 2019,

77

causing the COVID-19 pandemic with extensive morbidity and mortality, leading to major changes

78

in day-to-day life in many parts of the world. This was the third lethal respiratory human

79

coronavirus, after SARS-CoV in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-

80

CoV) in 2012, to emerge from bats in the twenty-first century. Although these viruses are all

81

members of the Betacoronavirus genus (1), each has caused a somewhat different pattern of

82

pathogenesis and spread in humans, with SARS-CoV-2 alone capable of spreading from

83

asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals (2). Therefore it is important to understand how

84

these viruses interact with their host.

85
86

Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with large, positive-sense single-stranded (ss)RNA

87

genomes of around 30kb that can infect a diverse range of mammals and other species.

88

Coronaviruses use much of their genomes, including their approximately 20 kb Orf1ab replicase

89

locus comprising the 5’ two thirds of the genome, to encode proteins that antagonize host cell

90

responses (3). As a result they are remarkably adept at antagonizing host responses, in particular

91

the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-induced pathways that are essential components of the host

92

innate immune response (4-8). In addition, interspersed among the structural genes encoded in

93

the 3’ third of the genome are lineage-specific genes encoding accessory proteins, which are non-

94

essential for RNA replication and variable among CoV lineages that further divide the

95

Betacoronavirus genus (9). These accessory proteins often have functions in antagonizing host

96

cell responses and thus likely contribute to discrepancies in pathogenesis and tropism observed

97

among the different lineages (10-12).

98
99

Like other RNA viruses, coronaviruses produce dsRNA early during the infection cycle as a result

100

of genome replication and mRNA transcription (13). Host cell pattern recognition receptors

101

(PRRs) sense viral dsRNA as pathogenic non-self and respond by activating several antiviral

102

pathways critical for early defense against viral invasion. DsRNA sensing by cytosolic PRRs can

103

be divided into three key pathways – interferon (IFN) production, oligoadenylate-ribonuclease L

104

(OAS-RNase L) activation, and protein kinase R (PKR) activation (Fig 1) (14). Detection of dsRNA

105

by MDA5 during coronavirus infection (15), leads to the production of type I (a/b) and type III (l)

106

IFN. Upon binding to its specific cell surface receptor, IFN triggers phosphorylation of STAT1 and

107

STAT2 transcription factors, which then induce expression of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) with

108

antiviral activities (16, 17). In parallel, dsRNA is also sensed by oligoadenylate synthetases

109

(OASs), primarily OAS3, which synthesize 2’,5’-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) (18, 19).

110

Generation of 2-5A induces dimerization and activation of RNase L, leading to degradation of viral

111

and host ssRNA (20). Finally, dsRNA sensing by PKR induces PKR autophosphorylation,

112

permitting PKR to then phosphorylate the translation initiation factor eIF2a, which results in

113

protein synthesis shutdown and restriction of viral replication (21). While RNase L and PKR

114

antiviral activity are not dependent on IFN production (18), the genes encoding OASs and PKR

115

are ISGs, therefore these pathways can be activated and/or reinforced by IFN production.

116

Similarly, RNase L and PKR activation can promote IFN production, cellular stress, inflammation,

117

and/or apoptotic death (22-27), thus further reducing host cell viability.

118
119

Induction and inhibition of innate immune responses during infection with SARS-CoV-2 have yet

120

to be fully characterized. Several recent reports implicate genetic deficiencies in IFN responses

121

(28, 29) or polymorphisms in OAS genes (30) with more severe COVID-19 disease, emphasizing

122

the importance of understanding the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and these innate

123

response pathways. Furthermore, while it is known that SARS-CoV-2 enters the human body

124

through the upper respiratory tract, it is unclear which cell types of the upper and lower respiratory

125

system contribute to sustained infection and resulting disease in the airways and elsewhere. We

126

have performed SARS-CoV-2 infections of primary nasal epithelial cells, induced pluripotent stem

127

cell (iPSC)-derived alveolar type 2 cells (iAT2), and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iCM), which

128

collectively represent the host tissues likely affected by clinical SARS-CoV-2 infection (31, 32).

129

We assessed viral replication in these cell types as well as the degree of ensuing dsRNA-sensing

130

responses. We also employed two lung derived immune-competent cells lines, Calu-3 and A549

131

cells, to investigate dsRNA-induced pathway activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition,

132

we compared host responses to SARS-CoV-2 with those of MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV-

133

DNS4ab, a mutant lacking expression of two dsRNA-induced innate immune pathway antagonists

134

that we have characterized previously (10).

Results
SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in cells derived from upper and lower respiratory tract.

139

We compared the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV in nasal epithelia-derived cells, a

140

relevant site of infection in vivo (Fig 2A). For each virus, replication was similar in cells from four

141

different individuals, although the extent of replication was somewhat variable. The trends in

142

replication kinetics, however, were significantly different between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV

143

infections. Replication of SARS-CoV-2 increased until 96hpi, but then plateaued at nearly 106

144

plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml. MERS-CoV replication peaked at 96hpi, at a lower titer than

145

SARS-CoV-2, and produced fewer PFU/mL at later timepoints. Nasal epithelial cell cultures were

146

stained with antibodies to identify ciliated cells (anti-type IV b-tubulin), a key feature of this cell

147

type, and either SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV nucleocapsid expression (anti-N protein) (Fig 2B).

148

We detected abundant N expression in both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV infected cells,

149

indicating that these cells were sufficiently infected at 48 hours post infection (hpi). Interestingly,

150

robust replication occurred in these cultures, despite a very low level of ACE2 protein expression

151

in cells from the three individuals examined (Fig 2C).

153

We measured dsRNA-induced host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including type I and type

154

III IFN mRNA induction, RNase L activation, and PKR activation, in the nasal cells. For RT-qPCR

155

analysis, we extracted RNA from SARS-CoV-2 infected cultures from four different donors at

156

120hpi. We verified that virus was replicating by quantifying viral genome copies from intracellular

157

RNA (Fig S1A). We then quantified mRNA expression of IFN-b (type I IFN), IFN-l (type III IFN),

158

select ISGs (OAS2, IFIT1, IFIH1), and the neutrophil attracting chemokine IL-8 (CXCL8), which

159

has been implicated in nasal inflammation during viral infection (33, 34) (Fig 2D). There was some

160

induction of IFN-b and to a lesser extent IFN-l mRNA, and minimal induction of the ISG mRNAs

161

examined. Similarly, CXCL8 encoding IL-8 was barely induced. Interestingly, this may be at least

162

partially due to high basal levels of IFN (notably IFN-l) and ISG (notably OAS2) mRNAs

163

compared with other cell types examined below, which would result in weak fold changes in

164

mRNA levels compared with mock infected cells (Fig S2). To further investigate this very weak

165

ISG induction, using cells from the same donors as the IFN/ISG mRNA quantification, we

166

assessed the phosphorylation of STAT1, a transcription factor that is itself encoded by an ISG,

167

which is primarily a key mediator of type I and type III IFN signaling (35). Consistent with the weak

168

activation of ISGs, there was no evidence of phosphorylation of STAT1 (Fig 2C). In addition, we

169

did not detect PKR activation in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, as indicated by the absence of

170

phosphorylated PKR and eIF2a. This is in contrast to the phosphorylated eIF2a detected in

171

Sendai virus (SeV) infected cells from two of the three donors (Fig 2C). We also assessed

172

activation of the OAS-RNase L pathway during SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells from two of the

173

same four donors. Since 28S and 18S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are targeted for degradation by

174

activated RNase L, we evaluated 28S and 18S rRNA integrity using a Bioanalyzer as a readout

175

for RNase L activation. The absence of any rRNA degradation in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (Fig

176

2E) indicated that RNase L was not activated despite abundant RNase L protein expression (Fig

177

2C).

180

Next, we sought to examine host innate immune responses during infection of alveolar type 2

181

cells (AT2), a major target of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans (31, 36, 37). We employed induced

182

pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived iAT2 cells (SPC2 line), expressing tdTomato from the

183

endogenous locus of surfactant protein-C (SFTPC), an AT2 cell specific marker (38). As in nasal

184

cells, virus replicated efficiently, reaching a titer of 106 PFU/ml by 48hpi (Fig 3A). Staining of

185

cultures with an anti-N antibody showed that most of the iAT2 cells were infected, without obvious

186

cytopathic effect (CPE) during infection (Fig 3B). Notably, SARS-CoV-2 infection of iAT2 cells

187

was robust despite ACE2 expression being below the level of detection by immunoblotting (Fig

188

3C). We observed activation of the PKR pathway as indicated by both PKR and eIF2a

189

phosphorylation (Fig 3C). We extracted RNA from infected iAT2 cells for RT-qPCR analysis,

190

verified these cells were replicating virus by quantifying genome RNA copies (Fig S1B), and

191

assessed IFN/ISG induction. As with the nasal cells, we observed weak induction of IFN-b and

192

IFN-l mRNA from mock infected and infected cells (Fig 3D), as well as no detection of MDA5

193

protein (15), a dsRNA sensor in the pathway leading to IFN production during coronavirus

194

infection (Fig 3C). We used the alphavirus Sindbis virus (SINV) as a positive control, which we

195

have previously shown induces robust activation of all dsRNA-induced pathways (10).

196

Surprisingly, we observed greater increases in OAS2 and IFIT mRNA expression by SARS-CoV-

197

2 compared with SINV (Fig 3D), but with minimal induction of IFIH1 mRNA, consistent with the

198

lack of MDA5 protein expression (Fig 3C&D). However, we did not observe phosphorylation of

199

STAT1 (Fig 3C), as in the nasal cells above. Additionally, we did not observe any degradation of

200

rRNA in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, and only slight degradation by SINV despite ample

201

expression of RNase L (Fig 3E), suggesting minimal activation of RNase L in iAT2 cells in general.

202
203

SARS-CoV-2 replicates and induces innate immune responses in iPSC-derived

204

cardiomyocytes. Since many COVID-19 patients experience cardiovascular symptoms and

205

pathology (39, 40), we investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection of iPSC derived-cardiomyocytes (iCM).

206

SARS-CoV-2 replicated robustly in these cells, reaching titers of approximately 106 PFU/ml by

207

48hpi (Fig 4A), similar to replication in nasal and iAT2 cells. Cells were stained with an antibody

208

against cardiac troponin-T (cTnT) as a marker for cardiomyocytes, and an antibody against the

209

viral N protein to identify infected cells (Fig 4B). In addition, we detected clear CPE in the iCM,

210

which differed from infected nasal and iAT2 cells. This CPE included syncytia resulting from cell-

211

to-cell fusion, which is typical of coronaviruses (41-45). Interestingly, while we observed

212

detectable ACE2 protein expression in mock infected or SINV infected cells in two independent

213

experiments, we observed loss of ACE2 expression upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, consistent with

214

a recent study (32) (Fig 4C). We extracted RNA from mock infected cells and cells infected with

215

SARS-CoV-2 or SINV, verified that virus was replicating by quantifying viral genome (Fig S1C),

216

and quantified expression of mRNAs for IFNs and select ISGs. We found low levels of IFN/ISGs

217

transcript in iCM similar to the nasal and iAT2 cells (Fig D), perhaps due to the undetectable

218

levels of MDA5 and MAVS protein expression in these cells (Fig 4C). SINV also induced host

219

mRNAs weakly, with the exception of IFN-l, in these cells (Fig 4D). We observed no degradation

220

of rRNA, suggesting an absence of RNase L activation in iCM with SARS-CoV-2 or SINV (Fig

221

4E), despite clear infection with either virus (Fig S1C). This was not surprising as there was no

222

RNase L detectable by immunoblot in these cells (Fig 4C). Finally, as in iAT2 cells, we observed

223

phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2a, indicating that the PKR antiviral pathway is activated (Fig

224

4C).

233

CoV (10, 47). A549 cells were not permissive to SARS-CoV-2, due to lack of expression of the

234

SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 (Fig S3). Therefore, we generated A549 cells expressing the ACE2

235

receptor (A549ACE2) by lentiviral transduction, and used two single cell clones, C44 and C34, for

236

all experiments (Fig S3). Both A549ACE2 clones express high levels of ACE2 greater than the

237

endogenously expressed ACE2 in Calu-3 cells (Fig S3) and in the primary cells discussed above

238

(Fig 2-4).

239
240

We performed single step growth curves to measure replication of SARS-CoV-2 over the course

241

of one infectious cycle in A549ACE2 cells, simian Vero-E6 cells, which are commonly used to

242

prepare SARS-CoV-2 stocks, and Calu-3 cells (clone HTB-55). SARS-CoV-2 replicated robustly

243

in A549ACE2 and Vero-E6 cells (Fig 5A), although viral yields were lower in Calu-3 cells (Fig 5B).

244

Since Calu-3 cells also support MERS-CoV infection, we compared SARS-CoV-2 replication to

245

that of wild type MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV-DNS4ab, a mutant deleted in host cell antagonists

246

NS4a, a dsRNA-binding protein, and NS4b, a 2’5’-phosphodiesterase that prevents RNase L

247

activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kB (10, 48). Consistent with our previous work (10),

248

MERS-CoV-DNS4ab reduced viral titers from WT MERS-CoV levels, although they remained

249

higher than SARS-CoV-2 titers (Fig 5B). To further understand the replication of SARS-CoV-2,

250

we stained A549, Vero-E6, and Calu-3 cells at 24 hpi with antibodies against viral N protein and

251

viral dsRNA, including additional Calu-3 staining at 48 hpi since replication kinetics are slower

252

(Fig 5C). We observed cytopathic effect in all three cell types, with N localized to the cytoplasm.

253

Syncytia were observed in A549ACE2 and Calu-3 cells, but not in Vero-E6 cells (Fig 5C). We also

254

observed viral dsRNA localized to perinuclear foci as we and others have described during

255

infection with other coronaviruses (10, 49-51).

256
257

We used RT-qPCR to quantify the induction of type I and type III IFNs and select ISGs at 24 and

10

258

48 hpi (Fig 6A), as well as the intracellular viral genome copies to verify replication (Fig 6B) in

259

A549ACE2 cells. Using SINV as a positive control, we found relatively low levels of both IFNb and

260

IFNl mRNA at 24 and 48 hpi by SARS-CoV-2, compared to SINV (Fig 6A). Notably, IFN induction

261

was greater than observed in the nasal, iAT2, or iCM cells, possibly due to lower basal levels of

262

IFNb, but not IFNl, mRNA in the A549ACE2 cells, which allow for greater fold changes over mock

263

infected cells (Fig S2). Levels of ISG mRNAs were variable, with SARS-CoV-2 inducing moderate

264

levels of OAS2 and IFIT1 mRNAs, but only late in infection (48 hpi), similar to those induced by

265

SINV at 24 hpi (Fig 6A). We observed minimal effects on mRNA levels of IFIH1 and CXCL8 at

266

both timepoints (Fig 6A). Furthermore, we did not detect any STAT1 phosphorylation at 24 hpi

267

(Fig 6C), which correlates with weak ISG expression, suggesting defective IFN signaling

268

downstream of IFN production.

269
270

We evaluated IFN/ISG responses in Calu-3 cells, which provided a second lung-derived cell line

271

that additionally supports both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV infection, allowing us to compare

272

host responses between the two lethal CoVs. We compared SARS-CoV-2 responses to both WT

273

MERS-CoV and mutant MERS-CoV-DNS4ab (Fig 7A). Although we observed reduced MERS-

274

CoV-DNS4ab infectious virus production compared with WT MERS-CoV (Fig 5B), we detected

275

similar intracellular viral genome levels of all three viruses (Fig 7B). We found previously that

276

MERS-CoV-DNS4ab induces higher levels of IFNs and ISGs compared to WT MERS-CoV, and

277

also activates RNase L and PKR (10). Herein, in Calu-3 cells, we observed greater SARS-CoV-

278

2 induction of IFN mRNAs as compared to A549ACE2 cells (Fig 6A&S4B). Interestingly, SARS-

CoV-2 induced higher IFN mRNA levels than WT MERS-CoV at 24 and 48 hpi (Fig 7A). Similarly,

280

SARS-CoV-2 generally induced more ISG mRNA than WT MERS-CoV, and even more OAS2

281

mRNA than MERS-DNS4ab (Fig 7A). Induction of CXCL8 was weak for all viruses (Fig 7A).

282

Notably, SARS-CoV-2 induced ISG mRNAs in Calu-3 (24hpi) without the delay observed in

283

A549ACE2 cells. Consistent with earlier ISG mRNA induction during infection, SARS-CoV-2

284

infection promoted phosphorylation of STAT1 in Calu-3 cells (Fig 7C), as recently reported (52).

285

SARS-CoV-2 induced phosphorylation of STAT1 as well as rapid IFIT1 and OAS2 mRNA

286

induction suggests a similar host response to SARS-CoV-2 as that observed during mutant

287

MERS-CoV-DNS4ab infection, and not that of WT MERS-CoV infection.

288
289

SARS-CoV-2 infection activates RNase L and PKR. We assessed activation of the RNase L

290

pathway by analyzing intracellular rRNA integrity in infected cells, as described above. We found

291

that in A549ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 promoted rRNA degradation by 24 hpi, which was more clearly

292

observed at 48 hpi, using SINV as a positive control (Fig 8A). Evaluation of RNase L activation

293

in SARS-CoV-2, WT MERS-CoV, and MERS-CoV-DNS4ab infected Calu-3 cells showed SARS-

294

CoV-2 activation of RNase L to a similar extent as MERS-CoV-DNS4ab (10, 53) (Fig 8B). In

295

contrast, as we previously reported, MERS-CoV failed to activate RNase L (10, 47) (Fig 8B). We

296

also observed activation of PKR as indicated by phosphorylation of PKR and downstream eIF2a,

297

in both A549ACE2 cells (Fig 8C) and Calu-3 cells (Fig 8D) infected with SARS-CoV-2. In Calu-3

298

cells, SARS-CoV-2 induced PKR phosphorylation to a similar extent as MERS-CoV-DNS4ab,

299

while WT MERS-CoV failed to induce a response. These data are consistent with IFN/ISG

300

induction data described above, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not antagonize dsRNA

301

pathways as efficiently as MERS-CoV, but instead induces host responses similar to those

302

observed during MERS-CoV-DNS4ab infection.

303
304

The A549ACE2 cells were valuable in that they provided a system with intact innate immune

305

responses that was also amenable to CRISPR-Cas9 engineering. Thus, we used the A549ACE2

306

cells to construct additional cell lines with targeted deletions of MAVS, RNASEL, or PKR, as we

307

have done previously for parental A549 cells (19, 54). We could then use these cells to determine

308

whether activation of IFN, RNase L, and/or PKR resulted in attenuation of SARS-CoV-2

309

replication (19, 54). We validated the knockout (KO) A549ACE2 cell lines by western blot (Fig S5A)

310

and compared replication of SARS-CoV-2 in MAVS KO, RNASEL KO and PKR KO cells with

311

levels in WT A549ACE2 cells (Fig 9A). Interestingly, there was little effect on SARS-CoV-2

312

replication with MAVS or PKR expression absent. At 48 hpi in RNASEL KO cells, virus replication

313

was two- to four-fold higher compared to WT A549ACE2 cells (Fig 9A). While the difference in

314

replication between RNASEL KO and WT was not extensive, it was statistically significant in three

315

independent experiments. As a result of higher viral titers, infected RNASEL KO cells exhibited

316

strikingly more CPE as compared with WT, PKR KO, or MAVS KO cells, as demonstrated by

317

crystal violet-staining of infected cells (Fig 9B).

318
319

We assessed rRNA degradation in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 or SINV (Fig 9C) and, as

320

expected, found that rRNA remained intact in the RNASEL KO A549ACE2 cells, which further

321

validated these cells. However, rRNA was degraded in PKR or MAVS KO cells, indicating RNase

322

L activation in both of these cell types (Fig 9C). Similarly, the PKR pathway was activated by

323

SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 9D) and SINV (Fig S5B), as evidenced by phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2a,

324

in both RNASEL KO and MAVS KO cells. More pPKR was detected in RNASEL KO cells than

325

WT or MAVS KO cells, perhaps due to higher viral titer. Moreover, phosphorylated peIF2a was

326

observed even in absence of PKR, suggesting that at least one other kinase may contribute to

327

phosphorylation of eIF2a during infection with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 9D) but not SINV (Fig S5B).

328

These data are consistent with our previous findings that activation of the RNase L pathway does

329

not depend on MAVS signaling in A549 cells infected with SINV or Zika virus (ZIKV) (18, 55), and

330

demonstrate that the PKR pathway can also be activated independently of MAVS. Thus, RNase

331

L and PKR activation occur in parallel with IFN production (Fig 1), are not dependent on each

332

other (56).

Discussion
We evaluated responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary nasal epithelia-derived upper airway

339

cells and iPSC-derived type II airway (iAT2) cells, as well as iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iCM),

340

another likely target of infection (32). To complement these studies, we used two lung derived

341

transformed cell lines, Calu-3 cells and two different A549ACE2 clones, to more mechanistically

342

dissect activation and antagonism of these pathways by SARS-CoV-2. We found that the extent

343

of IFN induction and signaling is variable among the primary cell types and cell lines used, but is

344

consistently only poorly induced. Interestingly, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in

345

more IFN signaling (phosphorylation of STAT1 and IFN/ISG expression) when compared to

346

MERS-CoV in Calu-3 cells. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 activates RNase L and PKR in both

347

cell lines used, and PKR in iAT2 cells and iCM, but not in primary nasal cells. Using KO cell lines,

348

we demonstrate that RNase L expression significantly impacts SARS-CoV-2 viral titers and CPE

349

observed during infection. These data suggest that while SARS-CoV-2 is generally a weak

350

activator of IFN signaling responses of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, SARS-CoV-

351

2 can induce the PKR and OAS-RNase L pathways and thus is less adept at antagonizing host

352

responses than MERS-CoV.

353
354

As nasal cells are the initial replication site of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, we quantified virus

355

replication in infected nasal cell culture. We found that SARS-CoV-2 replicates to higher titer than

356

MERS-CoV, and that the time period for shedding of virus is much longer (Fig 2A). We suggest

357

that this longer period of replication in nasal cells and stronger immune responses in Calu-3 cells

358

may in part explain why SARS-CoV-2 is less virulent, yet more contagious than MERS-CoV.

359

Indeed for SARS-CoV-2, R0=5.7 (57) while for MERS-CoV, R0=0.45 (58).

361

Infection of all three primary cell types – nasal cells, iAT2 cells, and iCM – resulted in high levels

362

of SARS-CoV-2 replication, while only iCM exhibited obvious CPE (Figs 2-4). Syncytia formation

363

was observed in both A549ACE2 and Calu-3 cell lines and IFA staining with viral dsRNA-specific

364

antibody (J2) showed SARS-CoV-2 dsRNA localized to perinuclear areas in A549ACE2 and Calu-

365

3 cells, which is typical of coronavirus infection (Fig 5). The protein expression level of the SARS-

366

CoV-2 host receptor ACE2 (59-61) in primary cells and Calu-3 cells was either low or

367

undetectable, indicating that high levels of receptor are not necessary for productive infection (Fig

368

2-4&S3). This is similar to previous observations in the murine coronavirus (MHV) system where

369

viral receptor CEACAM1a is very weakly expressed in the mouse brain, a major site of infection,

370

and particularly in neurons, the most frequently infected cells (62).

371
372

The canonical IFN production and signaling pathways activated by the sensing of dsRNA, an

373

obligate intermediate in viral genome replication and mRNA transcription, provide a crucial early

374

antiviral response (Fig 1). However, the role of IFN responses during coronavirus infection is

375

complex and at times contradictory. While IFNs may contribute to pathogenesis later on in

376

infection, coronaviruses, often prevent these responses early on during infection in both animal

377

models and humans (63-66). Indeed, weak IFN responses have been observed during initial

378

stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but IFN produced later may contribute to the strong inflammatory

379

responses and resulting immunopathology observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection cytokine

380

storms (67, 68). Providing further evidence for the role of IFN in influencing coronavirus

381

pathogeneis, genetic defects in IFN signaling or the presence of antibodies against type I IFNs

382

are found in a fraction of individuals with severe COVID-19 (28, 29). Genome wide associations

383

of the OAS1, OAS2, OAS3 genes as well as the IFNAR2 receptor subunit gene have also been

384

associated with COVID-19 severity (30).

386

Antagonism of dsRNA-induced antiviral pathways has been well characterized for lineage a (for

387

example, MHV) (11) and lineage c betacoronaviruses (MERS-CoV and related bat viruses) (10),

388

however there is less known about lineage b betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV (2002) and

389

SARS-CoV-2. We and others have previously found that both MHV and MERS-CoV

390

betacoronaviruses induce only minimal type I and type III IFNs, and fail to activate RNase L or

391

PKR pathways (11, 47, 50, 69, 70). We found that SARS-CoV-2, like other betacoronaviruses,

392

induced limited amounts of type I and type III IFN mRNAs, although this was somewhat variable

393

among the cell types examined. Using SINV as a control for robust activation of IFN, we detected

394

low levels of type I and type III IFN mRNA in nasal cell, iAT2 cells, and iCM (Fig 2-4). However,

395

we observed higher levels of OAS2, an ISG, relative to SINV in iAT2 cells (Fig 3D). As we have

396

observed among murine cells, we saw vastly different levels of basal expression of both IFN and

397

ISG mRNAs among the cell types infected (Fig S2) (70-72). It is understood that higher basal

398

levels of innate immune response mRNAs typically result in a lower threshold for activation of

399

corresponding responses. Interestingly, we observed significantly higher basal levels, especially

400

IFN-l, in (uninfected) nasal cells as compared to iAT2 cells and iCM (Fig S2A). As major barrier

401

cells, we speculate that this may be important for protection as these cells are more often exposed

402

to infectious agents in the environment. Indeed, it is well documented that IFN-l serves as an

403

added defense for epithelial cells, which may perhaps explain some of the differences observed

404

in basal gene expression between nasal cells and iCM (73-75). As previously reported in heart

405

tissue, the iCM expressed undetectable levels of both MAVS and RNase L, (23, 76), which is

406

possibly to protect the heart from excessive inflammation.

407
408

In A549ACE2 cells, SARS-CoV-2 induced low levels of IFN-l and IFN-b mRNAs and somewhat

409

higher ISG mRNA by 48 hpi, as compared with SINV (Fig 6A). We observed greater increases

410

in IFN induction in Calu-3 compared to A549ACE2 (Fig 7A), which may be at least partially due to

16

411

higher basal levels of IFNs in the Calu-3 cells (Fig S2). Calu-3 cells were employed to directly

412

compare the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection with that of MERS-CoV and mutant MERS-

413

CoV-DNS4ab, which lacks the NS4a and NS4b proteins that inhibit IFN production and signaling

414

(10, 48, 50). In Calu-3 cells, SARS-CoV-2 induced more IFN mRNA than WT MERS-CoV,

415

approaching the level of MERS-CoV-DNS4ab (Fig 7A). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 induced

416

higher levels of ISG mRNAs than MERS-CoV and, in the case of OAS2, higher than MERS-CoV-

417

DNS4ab as well. Consistent with this, in Calu-3 cells SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV-DNS4ab, but

418

not WT MERS-CoV, promoted STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig 7C), which leads to ISG transcription

419

and antiviral responses. Overall, our results displayed a trend of relatively weak IFN responses

420

induced by SARS-CoV-2 in airway epithelial cells with limited ISG induction, when compared

421

with host responses to viruses from other families. This is in argreement with a recent report

422

demonstrating that the SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 encoded protein blocks STAT1 entry into the nucleus,

423

leading to the relatively weak IFN induction (77). Additionally, our data show that enhanced

424

IFN/ISG responses in Calu-3 cells restrict virus production, while lower host responses in

425

A549ACE2 cells correlate with higher viral titers (Fig 5). Considering how robust ACE2 expression

426

appears dispensable for infection of some cell types (nasal, iAT2, Calu-3), these data also

427

indicate that stronger innate immune responses may be more effective at restricting SARS-CoV-

428

2 replication than low ACE2 expression level.

429
430

We found that SARS-CoV-2 was unable to prevent activation of RNase L and PKR, although to

431

different extents among the cell types, unlike MHV and MERS-CoV, which shut down these

432

pathways (10, 11, 69). We observed PKR activation as indicated by phosphorylation of PKR and

433

eIF2a in SARS-CoV-2 infected iAT2 (Fig 3C) and iCM (one/two experiments) (Fig 4C), but not in

434

nasal cells (Fig 2C). However, we did not detect rRNA degradation indicative of RNase L

435

activation in these cell types (Fig 2E, 3E, 4E). Activation of both RNase L and PKR were observed

436

in A549ACE2 and Calu-3 cells during infection with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 8). In Calu-3 cells, this

437

contrasted MERS-CoV and was more similar to MERS-CoV-DNS4ab. Previous studies have

438

shown that MERS-CoV NS4a restricts phosphorylation of PKR by binding dsRNA, reducing its

439

accessibility to PKR (10, 50). Additionally, MERS-CoV NS4b, a 2’-5’ phosphodiesterase, prevents

440

RNase L activation by degrading 2-5A, the small molecular activator of RNase L (10, 47). Current

441

understanding of SARS-CoV-2 protein function infers an absence of these types of protein

442

antagonists, therefore it is not surprising that both of these pathways are activated during infection

443

of both A549ACE2 and Calu-3. Indeed, MERS-CoV-DNS4ab attenuation compared to WT MERS-

444

CoV, as well as lower SARS-CoV-2 titers than those of MERS-CoV (Fig 5B), may be at least in

445

part due to RNase L and PKR activation in addition to IFN/ISG induction in Calu-3 cells.

446
447

We found that SARS-CoV-2 did not activate dsRNA-induced pathway responses as robustly as

448

SINV (18, 19), which may be due to CoV antagonists encoded by the nsp genes of the replicase

449

locus (3, 78-80). Most notably, nsp15 encodes an endoribonuclease (EndoU) that has been

450

shown in the MHV system to restrict dsRNA accumulation and thus limit activation of both RNase

451

L and PKR (80, 81). Nevertheless, increased, albeit modest, replication and enhanced cell death

452

in SARS-CoV-2 infected RNASEL KO cells indicates that this pathway is activated and indeed

453

restricts replication and downstream cell death caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig 9A&B). In

454

contrast, we found that PKR KO had no effect on viral titer and infected cells still produced

455

detectable levels of peIF2α. These results mirror a previous report on SARS-CoV, which found

456

that both PKR and PKR-like ER Kinase (PERK) were activated during infection and contributed

457

to eIF2α phosphorylation (82). Our results therefore raise the possibility that SARS-CoV-2

458

infection activates multiple kinases of the integrated stress response, all of which target eIF2α.

459

We have previously found that MERS-CoV infection inhibits host protein synthesis independent

460

of PKR, so that PKR phosphorylation during MERS-CoV-DNS4ab infection did not lead to further

461

reduction (10).

462
463

KO of MAVS and the consequent loss of IFN production had no significant effect on viral titer or

464

cell death. This is similar to our previous findings demonstrating that RNase L activation can occur

465

independent of virus-induced IFN production during SINV (55) or ZIKV (18) infection in A549 cells,

466

as well as during MHV infection of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (56). We extend

467

these findings to demonstrate that PKR activation, like OAS-RNase L, can occur independently

468

of MAVS signaling, perhaps explaining the phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2a in iCM, which

469

express undetectable levels of MAVS protein (Fig 4). This underscores the importance of the

470

RNase L and PKR antiviral pathways, which can be activated early in infection upon concurrent

471

dsRNA sensing by OAS, PKR, and MDA5 receptors before IFN is produced. Alternatively, these

472

pathways can be activated in cells infected by virus that produce low levels of IFN only late in

473

infection, as we observe here with SARS-CoV-2. Further studies are required to determine

474

whether activation of PKR or RNase L during

475

outcomes characteristic of these pathways, including inhibition of protein synthesis, induction of

476

apoptosis, cleavage of viral RNA, or induction of inflammatory responses (Fig 1). Interestingly,

477

we observed possible RNase L-induced apoptosis in the SARS-CoV-2 infected A549ACE2 WT,

478

MAVS KO, and PKR KO cells, when compared with mock infected counterparts (Fig 9C).

479

However, RNASEL KO cells displayed the most cell death among the four cell lines, suggesting

480

that virus-induced cell lysis in the RNASEL KO cells where viral titers are highest (Fig 9B) is more

481

detrimental to cells than RNase L-induced programmed cell death.

SARS-CoV-2 infection results in functional

pathways, which highlights the distinctions among coronaviruses in interacting with these

486

pathways. However, like MERS-CoV and MHV, SARS-CoV-2 induces limited and late IFN/ISG

487

responses, indicating that proteins antagonizing innate immune responses are likely encoded.

488

Our future studies will focus on identifying specific innate immunity antagonists among lineage b

betacoronavirus accessory proteins as well as conserved proteins encoded in the replicase

locus.

as previously described (38). For generation of 2D alveolar cells for viral infection, alveolospheres

540

were dispersed into single cells, then plated on pre-coated 1/30 Matrigel plates at a cell density

541

of 125,000 cells/cm2 using CK+DCI media with ROCK inhibitor for the first 48h and then the

542

medium was changed to CK+DCI media at day 3 and infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Cardiomyocytes. Experiments involving the use of human iPSCs were approved by the

545

University of Pennsylvania Embryonic Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee. The iPSC line

546

(PENN123i-SV20) used for cardiomyocyte generation was derived by the UPenn iPSC core as

547

previously described (87, 88). This line has been deposited at the WiCell repository (Wicell.org).

548

iPSCs were maintained on Geltrex (Thermofisher Scientific)-coated plates in iPS-Brew XF

549

(Miltenyi Biotec) media at 37oC in 5% CO2/5% O2/90% air humidified atmosphere. Cells were

550

passaged every 5-7 days using Stem-MACS Passaging Solution (Miltenyi Biotec).

551

Differentiation of SV20 into cardiomyocytes (iCMs) was performed using previously described

552

protocols (89, 90). In general, iCMs were >95% positive for cardiac Troponin T staining by FACS.

553

Day 18-25 differentiated cells were replated and used for viral infection experiments.

Generation of A549ACE2 cells. A549ACE2 cells were constructed by lentivirus transduction of

556

hACE2. The plasmid encoding the cDNA of hACE2 was purchased from Addgene. The cDNA

557

was amplified using forward primer 5′-ACTCTAGAATGTCAAGCTCTTCCTGGCTCCTTC-3′ and

558

reverse

GTCTGAAC ′-3 (contained V5 tag sequences). The fragment containing hACE2-V5 was digested

561

by the XbaI and Sall restriction enzymes from the hACE2 cDNA and was cloned into pLenti-GFP

562

(Addgene) in place of green fluorescent protein (GFP), generating pLenti-hACE2-V5. The

563

resulting plasmids were packaged in lentiviruses pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus

565

post-transfection were used for transduction into A549 cells. Forty-eight hours after transduction,

566

cells were subjected to hygromycin (1 mg/ml) selection for 3 days and single-cell cloned. Clones

567

were screened for ACE2 expression and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 replication.

569

CRISPR/Cas9 engineered cells. RNASEL, PKR and MAVS KO A549ACE2 cells (clone 44) were

570

constructed using the same Lenti-CRISPR system and guide RNA sequences as previously

571

described (19, 54).

573

Viral growth kinetics. The nasal ALI cultures were apically infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=5)

574

or MERS-CoV (MOI=5). Viral stocks were diluted in nasal cell media, 50µl was added to each

575

well, the cells were incubated in 37°C for one hour, then the virus was removed and the cells were

576

wash three times with 200µl of PBS. For viral growth curves, at indicated time points, 200µl of

577

PBS was added to the apical surface, collected 5 minutes later and frozen for subsequent analysis

578

of shed virus by plaque assay. The inserts were transferred to new 24-well plates with fresh media

579

after each collection. For iAT2 or iCM, cells were plated in 12 or 6-well plates, 4X105 cells (iAT2)

580

or 6.25X105 cells per well (iCM), cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI=5 (iAT2) or MOI=1

581

(iCM). At 6, 24, 48 hours postinfection, 200μl of supernatant were harvested and stored in -80°C

582

for infectious virus titration. For infections, cell lines were plated in 12-well plates, A549 and Vero-

583

E6 at 5X105 cells per well and Calu-3 at 3X105 cells per well. Viruses were diluted in serum-free

584

RPMI (A549 infections) or serum-free DMEM (Vero infections) or serum-free MEM (Calu-3

585

infections) and added to cells for absorption for 1 hour at 37°C. Cells were washed three times

586

with PBS and fed with DMEM or RPMI +2% FBS for Vero and RPMI infections, respectively, or

587

4% FBS in MEM for Calu-3 infections (47). For virus titration 200µl of supernatant was collected

588

at the times indicated and stored at -80°C for plaque assay on Vero-E6 (SARS-CoV-2) or Vero-

589

CCL81 (MERS-CoV) cells as previously described (91).

Plaque assay. Briefly virus supernatant was 10-fold serial diluted and inoculum was absorbed on

592

Vero-E6 cells (SARS-CoV-2) or VeroCCL81 cells (MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV-Δ4ab) for 1 hour

593

at 37°C. Inoculum was overlaid with DMEM plus agarose (either 0.7% or 0.1%) and incubated for

594

3 days at 37°C. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1% crystal violet for

595

597

Immunofluorescent staining. For nasal ALI culture, following 48 hours of infection, the cultures

598

were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 minutes. The transwell supports

599

were washed 3 times with PBS prior to excision of the membrane containing the cells. The cells

600

were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and then immersed in PBS with 0.2% Triton

601

X-100, 10% normal donkey serum, and 1% BSA for 60 min at room temperature. Primary antibody

602

incubation was incubated overnight at 4ºC (Type IV tubulin, Abcam ab11315, rabbit anti SARS-

603

CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein, GeneTex, Irvine, CA). Visualization was carried out with Alexa

604

Fluor®-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgGs (Thermo-Fisher) (1:1000; 60 min

605

incubation at room temperature). Confocal images were acquired with an Olympus Fluoview

606

System (Z-axis step 0.5μm; sequential scanning). For iAT2, the cell monolayer was fixed using

607

4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30min, 1X PBS was used to removed PFA and proceed with

608

antibody staining. Fixed cells were treated with a blocking solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100

609

and 5% donkey serum in 1X PBS for 30min. Immunostaining was performed for SARS-CoV-2

610

nucleocapsid protein expression using the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody at 1:1000 dilution

611

in blocking solution incubated for 30min. After washing primary antibody away, a secondary Alexa

612

Fluor 488®-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody( Thermo-Fisher) was used at 1:400

613

dilution in blocking solution and incubated for 30min. Secondary antibody was washed away with

621

for 2hr at RT. Slides were mounted in Slowfade Gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen

622

S36939). Images were acquired with BZ-X710 all-in-one fluorescence microscope equipped with

623

BZ-X Viewer software (Keyence Corporation). At the indicated times post-infection cells were

624

fixed onto glass coverslips (Calu-3 coverslips were coated with rat tail collagen type-1: Cell

625

Applications, Inc. Cat. # 122-20) with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes at room temperature.

626

Cells were then washed three times with PBS and permeabilized for 10 minutes with PBS+0.1%

627

Triton-X100. Cells were then blocked in PBS and 3% BSA for 30-60 minutes at room temperature.

628

Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated on a rocker at room temperature

629

for one hour. Cells were washed three times with blocking buffer and then incubated rocking at

630

Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).

657

A549, Calu-3, and iAT2 cells were lysed at indicated times post infection in RLT buffer and DNase-

658

treated before total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA from iCM

659

and nasal cells was extracted using TRIzol-LS (Ambion), and DNase-treated using the DNA-

660

freeTM Kit (Invitrogen). RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with a High Capacity cDNA

661

Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Applied Biosystems). cDNA was amplified using specific RT-qPCR

662

primers (see Table below), iQÔ SYBRÒ Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), and the QuantStudioÔ 3

663

PCR system (Thermo Fisher). Host gene expression displayed as fold change over mock-infected

664

samples was generated by first normalizing cycle threshold (CT) values to 18S rRNA to generate

665

DCT values (DCT = CT gene of interest - CT 18S rRNA). Next, D(DCT) values were determined by

666

subtracting the mock-infected DCT values from the virus-infected samples. Technical triplicates

667

were averaged and means displayed using the equation 2-D(DCT). For basal expression levels, CT

668

values were normalized to 18S rRNA to generate DCT values (DCT = CT gene of interest - CT 18S

669

rRNA), and displayed as 2-ΔCt. Basal expression levels were also calculated as fold change over

670

A549ACE2 clone 44 using the equation 2-Δ(ΔCT). Δ(ΔCT) values were calculated by subtracting ΔCT

671

values from each cell type from the ΔCT value of A549ACE2 clone 44. Absolute quantification of

672

SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV genomes was calculated using a standard curve generated from

674

SARS-CoV-2, construct pcDNA6B-nCoV-NSP12-FLAG encoding the RDRP gene (gift from Dr.

675

George Stark, Cleveland Clinic) was digested with Xho1 and purified by Qiagen QIAquick PCR

676

Purification Kit to be used as a standard in the RT-qPCR reaction. For MERS-CoV, cDNA MERS-

677

D1 (91) containing basepairs 12259–15470 of the MERS-CoV genome was digested with BgII

678

and purified by Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification Kit to be used as a standard in the RT-PCR

679

reaction. Copy numbers were generated by standard curve analysis in the QuantStudioÔ 3

680

software, and copy numbers per ug RNA were calculated based on the volume of cDNA used in

681

the qPCR reaction, and concentration of RNA used to generated cDNA. Primer sequences are

Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses and plotting of data were performed using GraphPad

692

Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., CA). SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV replication trends

693

in nasal cells were analyzed by two-way ANOVA comparing averaged titers from all four donor

694

cells for each virus at each timepoint. MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV-DNS4ab viral replication and

695

primary cell RT-qPCR gene expression between SARS-CoV-2 and SINV were analyzed by paired

696

Student t test. RT-qPCR analysis in A549ACE2 cells was analyzed by one-way ANOVA, comparing

697

SARS-CoV-2 at each timepoint to SINV. RT-qPCR analysis in Calu-3 cells was analyzed by two-

698

way ANOVA, comparing SARS-CoV-2 at each timepoint to MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV-DNS4ab.

699

SARS-CoV-2 replication in A549ACE2 WT cells compared with A549ACE2 KO cells was analyzed by

700

two-way ANOVA. Displayed significance is determined by p-value (P), where * = P < 0.05; ** = P

Figure 1. Double-stranded RNA induced innate immune responses during SARS-CoV-2

1114

infection. Coronavirus double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is produced through replication and

1115

transcription and recognized by cytosolic OAS, MDA5, or PKR host receptors to activate innate

1116

immune pathways. MDA5 signals through MAVS, leading to type I and type III IFN production and

1117

release from the cell where it binds to cell surface receptors, which induces phosphorylation and

1118

heterodimerization of STAT1 and STAT2 that then prompt ISG transcription and cytokine

1119

responses. OASs produce 2’-5’-oligoadenylates (2-5A) that bind RNase L, leading to

1120

homodimerization and catalytic activation of RNase L, which cleaves host and viral ssRNA to

1121

trigger apoptosis and inflammation. PKR autophosphorylates before phosphorylating eIF2a,

1122

which leads to translational arrest, cell death, and inflammatory responses. Graphic was created
