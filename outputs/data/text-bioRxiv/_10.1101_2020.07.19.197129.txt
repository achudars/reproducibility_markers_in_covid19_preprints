Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic originated from Wuhan, China in December 2019 raised an
alarming situation all over the globe. Sequencing of this novel virus provides an opportunity to
evaluate the genetic polymorphism present in the viral population. Herein, we analysed 173
sequences isolated from Indian patients and performed SNP linkage, clustering and
phylogenetic analysis to understand the local genetic diversity. We found that the SNP linkages
that lead to the identification of some global clades, do not hold true for the local clade
classification. In addition to the unique cluster, established by another Indian study, we
identified a new cluster (I-20D) that encompasses 28% of the analysed sequences. This cluster
is defined by two linked variations – C22444T and C28854T. A detailed study of such
polymorphisms can be useful for drug and vaccine development.

Introduction
The emergence and global spread of the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the major
point of concern for all affected countries. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 can be traced back to
late 2019 in Wuhan, China1. Since then SARS-CoV-2 has spread across the world and become
a global health emergency on March, 2020 when World Health Organisation (WHO) declared
COVID-19 as global pandemic2. The worldwide alarming situation can be foreseen with more
than 9,500,000 people infected and over 489,000 deaths reported globally (as of June 26th
2020). After its entry into human host, the continuous divergence of the virus generated at least
5 major clades globally till June 20203. Genetic analysis of the virus population can provide
information about the extent of molecular divergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the human
population.
Before December 2019, six human coronaviruses were known with different severity causing
pulmonary and gut infections. Four out of six, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43,
HCoV-HKU1 were common coronaviruses that are infecting worldwide population with low
pathogenicity to humans4,5. The remaining two human coronaviruses, Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are the two highly pathogenic coronaviruses. The novel seventh
Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a close relative of the SARS-CoV species as they share high
homology (~80%) and recognize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate infection
cycle5. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense ssRNA (single stranded RNA) virus with
approximately 30kb genome size.
Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, bats serve as reservoir hosts for progenitor of SARSCoV-26. SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest sequence homology (96.3%) with bat coronavirus
(RaTG13) isolated from a bat in Yunnan7. The Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARSCoV-2’s surface glycoprotein shares (86.64%) nucleotide sequence identity with pangolin
CoV’s RBD as compared to the bat virus, RaTG13 (86.19%)8. A recent study highlights a
recombination event between bat CoV and pangolin CoV, before its introduction in humans 9.
Strong purifying selection pressure and recombination shapes the origin and evolution of the
novel SARS-CoV-26,9. After its human entry the molecular divergence of SARS-CoV-2 is
continuing and it is important to track this molecular evolution to understand the epidemiology
of the disease and to effectively design drugs and vaccines for a target population.

In an earlier study10, 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were segregated in two lineages ‘L’ and ‘S’
based on two linked mutations. The expansion of the viral genome sequences revealed large
number of polymorphism in the population and their geo-distribution11. Nextstrain defines five
major global clades that can classify the overall global SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences3. The
geo-distribution of the mutations and therefore clades11 across countries can have severe impact
on the local evolution of the virus. In a previous study12, combination of four genetic variants
were used to define a unique clade predominant in India.
The publicly available whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different
countries can be utilized for understanding the evolution of the virus as of function of time and
geography11. The information can be used to characterize the novel viral mutations in a
population that can be further exploited for designing better diagnostic tests, vaccines and
antiviral drugs. In the present study, we characterized the genetic variants in 173 SARS-CoV2 genomes isolated from the Indian population, predominantly from Ahmedabad and Gujarat.
We analysed the genetic variants defining the phylogenetic clusters and established a new clade
dominant in the Indian population that was not reported earlier.
Materials and Methods
Data collection and sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Indian Population
173 FASTA sequence files of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from NCBI13 (update: 05-06-2020)
database. Only complete genomes originated from Indian population were used in this study.
Reference sequence and annotations of SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512) were retrieved from
GenBank, NCBI13 and the reference sequence was used as parent sequence for all other
sequences. The sequences were divided into two sets: initial set (update: till 17-05-2020) and
final set (update: till 05-06-2020). The first set of 60 sequences (59 Indian originated sequences
and 1 reference sequence) were used for initial analysis of genetic diversity, SNP linkages,
clustering and phylogenetic analysis. And the final set of 174 sequences was used to test the
results concluded from the analysis of initial set.
Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of initial set sequences was performed using MUSCLE
algorithm in MEGA14. Further, MEGA14 was used to evaluate the mutation type (Synonymous
or Non-synonymous) and frequencies at every single site in aligned sequences of whole
genome as well as concatenated CDS (coding regions). Mutations occurring 5 or more than 5

times were considered as recurrent mutations. The protein and conserved domain information
were retrieved from NCBI15.
Linkage Disequilibrium and linkage-based sequence clustering
The aligned file of all retrieved sequences of initial set was used to generate a HapMap file
with sixteen selected mutations containing information regarding sequence, sequence position
and allele frequency of both minor and major. TASSEL version 5.2.6116 was used to generate
linkage plot between the selected SNPs using HapMap file. Correlation analysis between
mutations, sequences and geographical locations was performed using ClustVis17 tool. A heat
map was generated using the following settings: unit variance scaling was applied to rows, both
rows and columns were clustered using correlation distance and average method, and tightest
cluster first was used for tree ordering of both rows and columns. Clusters were defined based
on the linked SNPs in the sequence.
Phylogenetic analysis and global distribution of clades
Phylogenetic analysis between SARS-CoV-2 sequences used in this study was performed using
PhyML18 with Smart Model Selection19 with tree searching using Nearest Neighbour
Interchange (NNI) and 100 bootstrap replicates. GTR+I substitution model was selected as best
model using BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) selection criteria.
Nextstrain nomenclature3 for clade identification was adopted and used to classify the
sequences in this study. For defining a new clade, at least 2 mutations should be away from its
parent major clade.
For global analysis, sequences were retrieved from all the countries who had deposited in NCBI
till June 5th 2020. Then Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was performed and frequency of
the occurrence of the two mutations simultaneously was assessed.
Functional Characterization of amino acid change
The N -gene variant, C194T, was evaluated for the functional characterization using the Protein
Variant Effect Analyser (PROVEAN) and PolyPhen-2. In PROVEANv1.120, the predefined
threshold score was used, i.e. -2.5. This cut off score corresponds to 80.4% sensitivity and
78.6% specificity. Polyphen-2 uses Naïve Bayes classifier for predicting functional
significance of the allele replacement21. Default parameters has been used for calculating the
Polyphen-2 score.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, their origin and date of collection
The viral genome isolates of Indian origin (n=173) along with the reference genome sequence
(Wuhan-Hu-1, NC_045512.2) were collected over the period of five and half months from
December 24, 2019 to June 5, 2020; and most of them (94.8%) were isolated after mid-April
(Fig: 1a). The most represented origin of isolated viruses was Ahmedabad, with 43.3%
(75/173) share of all sequences (Fig: 1b). Out of these 173 Indian origin SARS-CoV-2
sequences, 59 SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes (update: till 17-05-2020; initial set) were used
for initial evaluation of genetic diversity, SNP linkages and phylogenetic analysis. Rest of the
sequences along with the initial set (n = 173) were later used to validate the results obtained
from the analysis of initial sequence set.
Genetic diversity in the Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences
A total of 136 variations were identified in the initial sequence set studied as compared to the
reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 (NC_045512.2), Additionally, two unrelated
3-nucleotide deletions were observed in two different sequences. There were 91 singleton
mutations present, harbouring change only in one sequence. There were four sites, one in the
5' (1-265) and three in the 3' (29675..29903) UTR regions where mutations were observed. All
mutations present in 3' UTR region were singleton. However, a C to T mutation at position 241
(compared to the reference genome) in the 5’-UTR was found in about 86% of the 173 Indian
sequences.
In concatenated CDS region of all genes, total 131 variations were found, including 82 (62.6%)
non-synonymous and 49 (37.4%) synonymous mutations (Fig: 2a). Out of them, 88 (67.2%)
were singleton that includes 55 (62.5%) non-synonymous and 33 (37.5%) synonymous
mutations (Fig: 2a). For closely related isolates, relationship between selection and dN/dS
values is not monotonic. The high occurrence of non-synonymous mutations (Fig: 2b) at
selected sites might suggest a rapid sweep in the population and strong selection22.Therefore,
predicting selection pressure from dN/dS can be misleading22.
The analysis of the frequencies of mutated alleles in the initial set revealed the presence of 16
frequent mutations with minor allele frequency of f > 5% (the frequency that is considered
significant23), i.e. mutations present in more than three SARS-CoV-2 genomes were considered

for this analysis. The frequencies of these 16 selected recurrent mutations for initial as well as
final set are given in Table: 1.
As can be seen from the above table, the 10 non-synonymous mutations were distributed in
five genes coding seven proteins with variable frequencies, in the genes coding for ORF1ab
(Nsp3, Nsp6, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), S-gene (spike protein), ORF3a, M-gene
(membrane glycoprotein) and N-gene (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein). ORF1ab being the
largest coding region harboured higher non-synonymous mutations (n = 6) than any of the other
four genes (each having 1 non-synonymous mutation). In ORF1ab two non-synonymous
mutations were found in Nsp3 protein, one in C-terminal SARS-Unique Domain (SUD)
(S716I) and the other in nucleic acid-binding domain (T1198K). In Nsp6, a transmembrane
domain containing protein, of ORF1ab there was a leucine to phenylalanine mutation (L37F).
The other three non-synonymous mutations in ORF1ab were present in the RPol N-terminus
of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (A97V, P323L and L329I). In surface glycoprotein there
was a frequent aspartic acid to glycine change at position 614 (D614G) outside of receptor
binding domain. APA3_viroporin region of ORF3a had a frequent glutamine to histidine
change at position 57 (Q57H). Whereas there were two frequent amino acid changes in
nucleocapsid phosphoproteins (P13L and S194L).
SNP linkage and Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes
To analyse and visualize the linkage pattern among the selected sixteen recurrent mutations, a
linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was performed using TASSEL 5.2.6116. We found that
most of the analysed SNPs had shown linkage, with value of D' (Fig: 3a, upper right triangle)
as 1 and varying R2 value (Fig: 3a, lower left triangle) as the allele frequency is varying for
different mutation pairs. Some SNPs had shown strong linkage24 with similar allele frequencies
having R2 value more than 0.8 along with D' value of 1 (Fig: 3b, Table: 2).
To further confirm the above finding a correlation analysis between recurrent mutations and
individual sequences were performed using ClustVis17. As expected, we observed a clear
clustering of sequences based on the linkage pattern of various mutations (Fig: 4, Table: 2).
There were two broad clusters, one minor (A) and one major (B) cluster that divide the
population in two distinct groups. The minor group was nearer to reference genome in sequence
similarity and the major group can be further divided into two smaller groups (C and D). Both
‘C’ and ‘D’ encompass two further smaller clusters ‘E’ and ‘F’ respectively. Likewise, ‘A’

cluster contains a small cluster ‘G’. In our study population there was an over-representation
of SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from Ahmedabad and most of these sequences fall in the
major cluster ‘B’ indicating of a possible common origin of the sequences.
A phylogenetic tree was constructed using 60 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences
(including 1 reference genome) of the initial set. The phylogenetic tree revealed similar
organization of clusters and in agreement with our previous results (Fig: 5). The lineages can
be distinguished and identified based on the occurrence of the linked SNPs.
Extending analysis to 173 sequences and comparing with the global status
When we extended our analysis by comparing all 173 sequences together, we found that most
of the frequencies of selected recurrent mutations were matching with the initial sequence set
(Fig: 6). Frequencies of only two non-synonymous mutations were decreased by more than
five percent, indicating their loss in the population. There were some mutations which were
previously present in low numbers but after extending the sequence numbers they appear with
higher frequencies, suggesting either selection pressure operating on these sites or introduction
of new mutations from other population. Interestingly most of these new mutations were nonsynonymous in nature. Further phylogenetic analysis was performed to validate the previous
clustering and phylogeny of smaller sequence set; and emergence of new clades.
Nextsrain3,25 identified five global major clades, namely 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B and 20C till June
2020. Each of these clades was defined by the presence of at least two mutations. 19A is the
root clade related mostly to the reference sequence. 19B and 20A both emerged from 19A and
both have two linked mutations defining their major clades, T28144C and C8782T for 19B;
and C14408T and A23403G for 20A. 20B and 20C emerged from 20A defined by their linked
genetic variants. G28881A, G28882A and G28883C defines 20B whereas C1059T and
G25563T defines 20C.
On analysing the sequences, we found 19B, a cluster designated as a major cluster as per global
analysis, was not prominent (only 3.5% of samples) in our study population (Fig: 7). In
addition to 19B, we found another clade emerging out of 19A, encompassing 8.8% of our
sample population. This clade is defined by a set of four mutations; C28311T, C6312A,
C13730T and C23929T. This clade was also identified in another Indian study12 where they
observed around 29% of their study population to be in this cluster and named it as Clade I/A3i

(defined by a combination of same four variants). This study used viral genomes isolated from
Telangana along with other available sequences to infer the phylogeny. The observed
differences in the frequency of the sub-populations in these two studies in Clade I/A3i is due
to the altered demographics of the virus sequences.
Most of the sequences (~ 86%) used in our study population fall in the major clade 20A (Fig:
7). Nextstrain3 defined clade 20A by two mutations, C14408T and A23403G. We found an
additional mutation (C3037T) redefining the clade (I-20A, i.e. India-20A) for Indian
population (high D' and R2 values, Table: 2). Also, C241T mutation in the 5’UTR (not shown
here) is tightly linked with these variants of clade I-20A. Similar to 19B, very few sequences
(1.7%) represent clade 20B in our study population.
Clade 20C emerged from 20A and was defined by Nextstrain with two mutations, C1059T and
G25563T. Surprisingly, in our study population the linkage expected between these two
mutations was not found. On the contrary, G25563T was found to be strongly linked with
mutations C18877T and C26735T. Since this linkage was different from what was observed
for 20C, we renamed this clade as I-20C (India-20C) for Indian population.
In addition to the above clades we identified a novel clade (I-20D) emerging from I-20C,
representing around 28% of the sequences in the population studied. This clade was defined by
a combination of C22444T and C28854T variants (Fig: 7). C2836T was also found to be linked
with C22444T and C28854T (Table: 2, Fig: 5). Since the allele frequency of C2836T was
lower than C22444T and C28854T (Table: 1) in the final sequence set, it was not included in
the variant combination defining Clade I-20D.
The analysis was further extended to global population to check the spread of the Clade I-20D
across the world. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from various countries/continents were
retrieved from NCBI and the presence of variant combination (C22444T and C28854T) was
tested at respective positions of each sequence. We found this clade to be absent in Rest of Asia
(Excluding India), Africa and South America whereas North America, Europe and Oceania
had very low frequency (0.3, 0.3 and 0.8% respectively) of the variant combination (Table: 3).
Functional evaluation of SNPs in Clade I-20D

One of the two mutations defining the clade I-20D is synonymous (C22444T), while the other
one (C28854T) is non-synonymous therefore can cause a change in the amino acid sequence.
The C28854T variant was analysed for potential functional consequences using the Protein
Variant Effect Analyser (PROVEAN)20 and PolyPhen-221. This non-synonymous mutation
occurs in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, N, resulting in a change of Serine (S) to Leucine
(L) at 194 position of polypeptide. The change observed is in the serine rich region (181 –
213)15 of the protein. Since N is a phosphoprotein and serine being a potential site for
phosphorylation, change in serine to leucine can have functional consequences. Both
PROVEAN and PolyPhen-2 analyses suggest that the effect of this mutation was deleterious
in nature (Table: 4). However, further experimental studies are needed to determine the true
effect of this mutation.
Discussion
In this report, we investigated the pattern of molecular evolution of 173 SARS-CoV-2 genomes
isolated from Indian population. On the basis of linkages between sixteen recurrent SNPs (each
found in more than 5% sequences), sequences were clustered and subsequently clades were
defined. In this study population, we found two unique clades, that were not among the major
global clades as defined by Nextstrain. One of the two clades that we identified was also
reported by Banu et at., wherein the cluster was named, Clade I/A3i12. The identification of the
cluster was defined by a combination of four variants, C28311T, C6312A, C13730T and
C23929T. Similar to their observation, we found another linked SNP along with these variants
but not all of the sequences in the cluster shared this variant, G11083T (D’ and R^2 values with
all other four variants were less than 0.78 and 0.49, respectively), therefore excluded from the
clade identifier set. The above referred study included a large sequence population from
Telangana with the geographical distribution of this cluster was found to be prevalent in
Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Delhi. The major contributors to our study
population were the SARS-CoV-2 sequences originated mostly from Gujarat. Since this clade
(I-A3i) may not be predominant in Gujarat, the number of sequences belonging to the clade
was very less (8.8% of the total sequences).
In our analysis, we found another unique clade specific to the Indian population (absent in other
countries/continents). This clade was predominantly present in the study population (28% of
the total sequences) and was defined by two tightly linked SNPs, C22444T and C28854T. We
named this cluster, I-20D (India-20D), since it is derived from the parent clade I-20C (India-

20C). The global clade, 20C was redefined for our study population as the combination of two
variants C1059T and G25563T, defining it, was missing in the sequences we analysed. Instead,
G25563T was found to be strongly linked with C18877T and C26735T and hence we renamed
this clade as I-20C. Similarly, clade 20A was renamed I-20A as C14408T and A23403G was
tightly linked with C3037T. Therefore, the SNPs that determine the clades in global population
(Nextstrain) have shown an altered occurrence patterns in Indian population.
Recently, a study demonstrated increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 virus when D (Aspartic
Acid) at 614 position of surface glycoprotein converted into G (Glycine)26. The D614G
(A23403G) is one of the mutation identifiers of 20A global clade, which was found to occur in
86% of our study population. Whether this mutation has resulted in a higher infectivity in
Indian population needs to be investigated further. The C to T conversion at 28854 position in
the N gene of viral genome in the clade I-20D (S194L) may alter the function of the
Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein. This change was predicted to be deleterious by two
programmes21,20. More experimental studies are needed to confirm the role of this mutation in
N-gene.
This study brings out the presence of a novel cluster of mutations (I-20D) forming a distinct
clade, exclusively found amongst Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We also found alterations in
the mutation composition among viral clusters 20A and 20C. The consequence of these
variations on the fitness of the virus and hence disease aetiology remains unclear. Instead, a
population genetic analysis, leading to the knowledge of polymorphisms can be better utilized
for drug and vaccine development.
