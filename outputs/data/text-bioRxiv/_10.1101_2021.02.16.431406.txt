Abstract

25
26

Clearance of viral infections, such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV),

27

must be fine-tuned to eliminate the pathogen without causing immunopathology. As such,

28

an aggressive initial innate immune response favors the host in contrast to a detrimental

29

prolonged inflammation. The complement pathway bridges innate and adaptive immune

30

system and contributes to the response by directly clearing pathogens or infected cells, as

31

well as recruiting proinflammatory immune cells and regulating inflammation. However, the

32

impact of modulating complement activation in viral infections is still unclear. In this work,

33

we targeted the complement decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55), a surface protein that

34

protects cells from non-specific complement attack, and analyzed its role in IAV infections.

35

We found that DAF modulates IAV infection in vivo, via an interplay with the antigenic viral

36

proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), in a strain specific manner. Our

37

results reveal that, contrary to what could be expected, DAF potentiates complement

38

activation, increasing the recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes and T cells. We also show

39

that viral NA acts on the heavily sialylated DAF and propose that it exacerbates

40

complement activation, leading to lung immunopathology. Remarkably, this mechanism

41

has no impact on viral loads but rather on the host resilience to infection and may have

42

direct implications in zoonotic influenza transmissions.

excessive complement activation and recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells,

without affecting viral loads. Furthermore, we observed that viral NA directly cleaves DAF

and promotes complement activation, providing a possible link between IAV-DAF

modulate disease severity, which may help to understand the increased pathogenicity of

Introduction

60
61

Host-pathogen interactions are very complex with both parts contributing to the

62

progression and outcome of infections. In the case of viruses, pathogen- and damage-

63

associated molecular patterns (PAMP and DAMP, respectively) are detected by pattern

64

recognition receptors (PRR) alerting the host of their presence, and triggering the immune

65

response to clear the infection (1,2). It is generally accepted that for viral infections, an

66

aggressive initial activation of innate immunity favors the host, whilst mechanisms that

67

originate prolonged inflammation are associated with severe outcomes. This paradigm

68

underpins for example the sex differences observed for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-

69

19), that results in lower death rate in women, despite similar incidence of infection in both

70

sexes (3–5). However, an excessive immune response activation might destabilize the

71

equilibrium needed to eliminate the pathogen without causing tissue damage, and lead to

72

immunopathology (6,7). It is therefore important to determine the host factors and viral

73

characteristics that result in an efficient immune response for clearing the pathogen

74

without provoking immunopathology.

75

Influenza A virus (IAV) is the prevalent cause of seasonal flu, a relevant health

76

problem as it kills up to 600,000 people worldwide yearly (8). IAV replication occurs in the

77

upper and lower respiratory tract, peaks normally 2 days after infection, and in most cases

78

little virus shed can be detected after 6 days. For the majority of people, symptoms (fever,

79

cough, acute viral nasopharyngitis, headache) clear after 7-10 days, with fatigue enduring

80

for weeks, without serious outcomes (8–10). In a proportion of people, however, severe

81

complications occur, with the elderly, immunosuppressed, pregnant women, and people

82

with associated comorbidities being at higher risk (11). IAV can also provoke pandemic

83

outbreaks, associated with zoonotic events, which lead to significant higher mortality than

84

seasonal epidemics. The 1918 Spanish influenza, for example, caused up to 50 million

85

deaths (12). Complications may include hemorrhagic bronchitis, pneumonia (primary viral

86

or secondary bacterial), and death (13–16). They usually derive from an exacerbated

87

immune response leading to tissue damage (17,18). Identifying intrinsic risk factors that

88

contribute to severe disease outcomes may minimize immunopathology in the lungs and

89

uncover new therapeutic targets with decreased proneness to develop resistance.

90

Defects in type I IFN response have been associated with the more severe cases

91

of COVID-19 (19,20), suggesting that the initial steps in immune activation define disease

92

outcome. However, there are other players involved in mounting immune responses, such

93

as the complement system. The complement system has been extensively reviewed (21–

94

23) and consists in a cascade of proteolytic interactions that lead to the direct killing of the

95

pathogen or infected cell, as well as proinflammatory immune cell recruitment.

96

Remarkably, C3 has been found within the mucus barrier (24), which elucidates

97

complement role in early immune response upon pathogen infection in the airways.

98

Disease severity and mortality have been associated with both lack or excess of

99

complement activation in several viral infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory

100

Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (25,26), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome

101

Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (27), SARS-CoV-2 (28–30), and IAV (31–33). However, it is still

102

unclear how fine-tuning complement activation may impact in the development of disease

103

severity. One strategy to tune complement activation in infection is to target its regulators.

104

Complement decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55) is a membrane-bound regulator of

105

complement activation (RCA) exposed at the surface of most cell types, including human

106

and murine airways (34–36). DAF promotes the decay of C3 convertases, thus protecting

107

healthy cells from non-specific complement attack, and inhibiting the release of

108

anaphylatoxins that would recruit and activate the immune response (37–39). In humans, it

109

has been reported that DAF deficiency leads to excess complement activation with

110

systemic implications (40,41). Furthermore, SNPs in DAF promoter region decreasing

111

protein expression have been associated with higher risk of severe infections by pandemic

112

and avian IAV strains (42,43).

113

In this work, we explore the role of DAF in activating complement and in

114

modulating IAV infection via an interplay with the antigenic viral proteins hemagglutinin

115

(HA) and neuraminidase (NA). We observed that DAF, contrary to what could be

116

expected, potentiates complement activation in IAV infection. We also describe that viral

117

NA acts on DAF, in a strain-specific manner, removing α-2,6-linked sialic acids and

118

propose that this may influence pathogenicity. Given that the recognition of different

119

conformations of sialic acid by the influenza virus is a key driver in influenza intra- and

120

interspecies transmission, our findings may have implications for zoonotic events. Our

121

results also showed that DAF leads to increased complement activation, as well as

122

immune cell recruitment, especially of neutrophils and monocytes, increasing lung

123

immunopathology without altering viral loads. Our work reveals a novel mechanism of

124

virulence in IAV infection.

Decay-accelerating factor (DAF) aggravates IAV infection by increasing
immunopathology.

130

Immune response to viral infections such as IAV must be tightly regulated in order to

131

clear the pathogen without causing immunopathology. The complement system is at the

132

frontline of the immune response, recognizing pathogens, and activating and recruiting

133

immune cells. The absence of a regulator of this system, such as DAF, is expected to

134

increase complement activation, resulting in more efficient viral clearance and/or increased

135

tissue damage. To assess the consequences of DAF depletion in the context of IAV

136

infection, C57BL/6J (WT) and C57BL/6J Daf-/- (Daf-/-) mice were challenged with two

137

different H1N1 strains circulating in the human population: A/California/7/2009 (Cal) and

138

A/England/195/2009 (Eng). For each viral strain, we measured bodyweight loss, as proxy

139

for disease severity, and followed survival up to 11 days post infection (d.p.i.) (Fig. 1).

140

Surprisingly, we observed that upon infection with Cal, Daf-/- mice exhibited reduced

141

bodyweight loss starting at 4 d.p.i., when compared to the WT, and maintained that

142

difference throughout the experiment (Fig. 1-A). In addition, percentage of survival of Daf-/-

143

mice when infected with Cal was higher than of WT mice (75% vs. 25%) (Fig. 1-B).

144

Similarly, upon challenge with Eng, Daf-/- mice had increased survival (50% vs. 25%), but

145

lost more of their initial bodyweight when compared to the WT (Fig. 1-C, D). WT mice

146

surviving to Eng infection had a milder bodyweight loss when compared to Daf-/- mice, thus

147

explaining the reversion in trends later in infection, and the consequent discrepancy

148

between bodyweight loss and survival. Taken together, our data indicate that DAF exerts a

149

detrimental effect for the host during IAV infection.

150

We then extended the observation to two different well-characterized IAV strains: the

151

mouse adapted virulent H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) and the less virulent H3N2 A/X-

31 (X31). X31 is a reassortant strain of PR8 containing segments 4 and 6 from A/Hong

153

Kong/1/68 (HK68) (44) and for clarity purposes, the X31 strain will be mentioned as PR8-

154

HK4,6 throughout this work. WT and Daf-/- mice were infected with sublethal and lethal

155

doses of PR8 or PR8-HK4,6, and bodyweight loss and mortality assessed for 11 d.p.i..

156

Upon infection with PR8, Daf-/- and WT mice presented similar bodyweight loss and all

157

mice succumbed to the disease, Daf-/- mice at 7 d.p.i., and WT mice at 8 d.p.i. (Fig. 2-A,

158

B). Upon infection with PR8-HK4,6, as observed in infections with the circulating strains,

159

Daf-/- mice had a less severe disease and mortality when compared with their WT

160

counterparts. These mice lost less of their initial bodyweight (-11.3% vs. -20.4%) and had

161

reduced mortality than WT mice (50% vs. 100%) (Fig. 2-C, D). The discrepancy between

162

PR8 and the other strains might be explained by the high virulence of this strain where 500

163

PFU of PR8 are a lethal dose, here quantified by the humane endpoint of infection of a

164

loss of more than 25% of initial bodyweight. These results show that DAF worsens disease

165

outcome in infection with mildly virulent IAV strains, both circulating in the human

166

population and lab-adapted but not with more virulent IAV strain.

167

As DAF is a complement regulator, the results indicate a role for complement in

168

modulating disease outcome. To dissect between the role of the complement pathway and

169

of this particular molecule, C57BL/6J mice depleted of CD59 (Cd59-/-), another regulator of

170

complement activation (RCA), were infected with PR8-HK4,6, and bodyweight loss and

171

mortality assessed for 11 d.p.i.. Interestingly, there was no difference in bodyweight loss

172

and mortality between Cd59-/- mice and their WT counterparts, with all mice succumbing to

173

the disease at 7 d.p.i. (Fig. 2-E, F). This indicates that the protection observed in Daf-/-

174

mice is mediated by the absence of this particular RCA, and not due to a general

175

complement deregulation.

176

Taken together, our results suggest a role for DAF in disease outcome. To further

177

dissect the mechanisms behind such role, we focused on infections with PR8-HK4,6 as it

178

is a well-described laboratorial model, with a virulence resembling circulating strains.

179

Protection conferred by DAF depletion could be explained by a decrease in viral

180

burden or by preventing immunopathology (6). To distinguish between these two

181

hypotheses, we started by assessing lung viral loads of WT and Daf-/- mice infected with a

182

sublethal dose of PR8-HK4,6. Samples were collected at day 3 and 6 p.i. to distinguish

183

between early viral replication and clearance. At both time points, lung viral titers were

184

identical in WT and Daf-/- mice (3.8±2.8 x 106 PFU/g vs. 3.1±2.7 x 106 PFU/g at 3 d.p.i.,

185

and 3.2±2.7 x 105 PFU/g vs. 3.3±4.3 x 105 PFU/g at 6 d.p.i.) (Fig. 3-A, B). Thus, the

186

amelioration of disease outcome is not associated with reduced viral replication nor faster

187

clearance. We then interrogated if the difference observed between WT and Daf-/- mice

188

could be explained by a spatial difference in lung tissue infection, as was previously

189

described for milder disease progression (45). To detect infected cells in specific parts of

190

the lung tissue, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of viral nucleoprotein

191

(NP) in mice lung sections at 3 d.p.i., time corresponding to higher viral loads. A blind

192

qualitative observation elucidated that in both WT and Daf-/- mice, infection foci were

193

mainly restricted to alveoli (Fig. 3-C), and quantification of infected bronchioli per lung

194

section did not display relevant dissimilarities (27.8±12.7 in WT and 28.4±9.8 in Daf-/-) (Fig.

195

3-D).

196

Lastly, to assess if protection of Daf-/- mice was linked to a decrease in lung damage

197

and immunopathology, a comprehensive and blind histological analysis of lung tissue was

198

performed at day 3 and 6 p.i. (Table S1). At 3 d.p.i., Daf-/- mice had a histological score of

199

4.0±1.3, whereas WT mice had a score of 5.4±2.0 (Fig. 3-E). At 6 d.p.i., this difference

200

became significant, with Daf-/- mice having a score of 10.8±2.2, and WT of 12.8±2.6 (Fig.

201

3-F). Therefore, IAV infected Daf-/- mice have reduced lung damage at 6 d.p.i., when

202

compared to their WT counterparts, demonstrating that DAF increases tissue damage.

203

These results show that DAF does not impact viral replication, clearance nor spatial

204

distribution in the lungs, but point to a new role for DAF as an immunopathology instigator.

205
206

DAF-induced immunopathology relies on elevated complement activation, immune

207

cell recruitment and levels of IFN-γ.

208

We have shown that Daf-/- mice suffer less severe disease than WT mice upon IAV

209

infection by decreasing tissue damage. Next, we aimed at dissecting the mechanism. DAF

210

being an RCA, we first focused on determining the role of the complement pathway. For

211

that purpose, C57BL/6J C3-/- (C3-/-) and C57BL/6J C3-/- / Daf-/- (C3-/- / Daf-/-) mice were

212

infected with 500 PFU of PR8-HK4,6 and bodyweight loss monitored over the course of

213

infection. As expected (46,47), C3-/- mice lost significantly more bodyweight than the WT,

214

losing up to 20.8% of the initial bodyweight, when WT mice lost only 9.8%. C3-/- / Daf-/-

215

mice, however, had a bodyweight loss comparable with C3-/- mice, losing up to 20.5% of

216

the initial bodyweight (Fig. 4-A). These results show that the protection of Daf-/- mice is C3-

217

dependent, and thus complement mediated.

218

DAF regulates complement activation by accelerating the decay of C3 convertases,

219

reducing the levels of C3a. Hence, we proceeded by analyzing the levels of C3a in the

220

bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) of PR8-HK4,6 infected WT or Daf-/- mice. The main

221

differences in tissue damage occurred at 6 d.p.i., and therefore we limited our analysis to

222

that time point. Quite surprisingly, in PR8-HK4,6 infected Daf-/- mice the levels of C3a were

223

of 439.8±474.6 ng/ml, and in WT mice of 1425.0±899.5 ng/ml (Fig. 4-B). Thus, IAV

224

infection induced lower complement activation in Daf-/- mice than in WT mice, indicating

225

that complement activation may play a role in increased tissue damage of WT mice. Taken

226

together these results highlight the equilibrium needed to clear the disease without causing

227

damage and the important role of complement in both these processes.

228

The complement pathway is a cascade of reactions that will release cytokines for

229

recruitment and activation of the immune system, and culminating in the formation of a

230

cytolytic pore (C5b-9). Our results showed that knocking out Cd59, inhibitor of C5b-9, does

231

not impact disease outcome in the context of IAV infection (Fig. 2-E, F), suggesting that

232

the protection observed in Daf-/- mice does not rely on complement-dependent cytotoxicity

233

(CDC). To confirm this hypothesis, WT and Daf-/- murine primary lung cells were infected

234

with PR8-HK4,6, treated with serum collected from naïve WT mice, and cell viability

235

assessed as a measurement of CDC. Daf-/--derived lung cells were more prone to CDC

236

than WT-derived ones, both at steady state (57.7±2.1% vs. 25.4±1.5%) and upon PR8-

237

HK4,6 infection (72.6±2.3% vs. 38.5±5.1%). This effect is specific of complement attack,

238

as heat-inactivated serum did not increase cell death (Fig. 4-C), and confirms that Daf-/-

239

mice protection is not dependent on complement cytolytic attack.

240

Given that Daf-/- mice have lower complement activation but that protection does

241

not depend on CDC, it should rely on the release of anaphylatoxins leading to an alteration

242

of immune cell recruitment and/or activation. To assess this, WT and Daf-/- mice were

243

infected with 1000 PFU of PR8-HK4,6 and the recruitment of specific immune cell types

244

measured in BALs. Analyses were carried at 3 and 6 d.p.i. in order to uncouple the first

245

rapid response from a more mature later one. At 3 d.p.i. we observed that Daf-/- mice had

246

similar numbers of natural killer (NK) cells and neutrophils recruited to the lungs, when

247

compared to WT mice (84.4±16.8% vs. 100±71.0% NK cells; 79.7±47.4% vs. 100±59.3%

248

neutrophils), but lower numbers of monocytes (66.3±30.3% vs. 100±25.6%) (Fig. 4-D-F).

249

At 6 d.p.i., Daf-/- mice maintained the lower number of monocytes when compared to WT

250

mice (58.1±30.3% vs. 100±35.8%), and also had reduced levels of neutrophils

251

(69.1±28.8% vs. 100±27.5%) (Fig. 4-G, H). Levels of NK cells were not analyzed at this

252

time point, nor in following analysis, as depletion of NK cells in PR8-HK4,6 infected WT

253

mice did not alter disease outcome (Fig. S1-A, B). Additionally, we analyzed recruitment of

254

adaptive immune cells, namely CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that have been shown to play an

255

important role in IAV infection (48). Interestingly, there was no difference in recruitment of

256

both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4-I, J), indicating that the protection observed in Daf-/-

257

mice is likely dependent on lower immunopathology mediated by the innate immune

258

response.

259

Cytokines are also key players in the recruitment and activation of the immune

260

system. IFN-γ, in particular, is an essential player in viral responses, and, like all members

261

of the immune system, can cause tissue damage. Indeed, it has recently been shown that

262

IFN-γ, which is produced upon IAV infection, is detrimental to the host by suppressing the

263

protective effect of group II innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) (49). Therefore, levels of IFN-γ

264

were measured in BALs of PR8-HK4,6-infected WT and Daf-/- mice at 6 d.p.i.. Daf-/- mice

265

had significantly lower levels of IFN-γ than WT (22.9±24.3 pg/mL vs. 44.4±32.5 pg/mL)

266

(Fig. 4-K), which is in accordance with the reduced IL6, immunopathology and tissue

267

damage in this context.

268

Taken together, these results suggest that lower complement activation leads to a

269

reduced immune response and recruitment of innate immune cells, such as neutrophils

270

and monocytes. This will allow a reduction in tissue damage, ameliorating disease

271

outcome. Interestingly, and counter-intuitively, the decrease in complement activation is a

272

consequence of the absence of a major complement regulator, DAF.

273
274

DAF-induced immunopathology depends on viral HA and NA.

275

We observed that lack of DAF protected mice from infection with PR8-HK4,6, but

276

not with PR8 (Fig. 2-A-D). These strains differ only in haemagglutinin (HA) and

277

neuraminidase (NA) (44). To investigate the individual role of these proteins in the

278

resilience to infection, we constructed chimeric viruses in PR8 background containing

279

either HA (PR8-HK4) or NA (PR8-HK6) from HK68. It is important to note that analyses

280

are performed in comparison with PR8-HK4,6 infections and not PR8. Therefore, it is the

281

removal of HK6 in PR8-HK4 that will allow investigating the contributions of different NAs,

282

and the removal of HK4 in PR8-HK6 that will enable assessment of the contributions of

283

HAs.

284

On a first step, Daf-/- and WT mice were infected with PR8-HK6, hence highlighting

285

the role of HA. Infection with a sublethal dose of PR8-HK6 resulted in a modest

286

amelioration of bodyweight loss in Daf-/- mice, reaching -16.8% of the initial bodyweight,

287

when compared to WT mice that lost up to 20.1% of the initial bodyweight (Fig. 5-A). When

288

infected with lethal doses of this strain, both Daf-/- and WT mice had a mortality of 100%

289

(Fig. 5-B). In vitro and ex vivo experiments had shown that this strain had increased

290

replication levels when compared to PR8, PR8-HK4,6 or PR8-HK4 (Fig. S2-A-E).

291

Therefore, we hypothesized that the increased mortality of Daf-/- mice, when compared to

292

infection with the other strains, could be due to increased viral titers. Interestingly, analysis

293

of lung viral loads showed no difference between Daf-/- and WT mice both at 3 and 6 d.p.i.

294

(Fig. 5-C, D) and titers were not higher that those observed for the infection with PR8-

295

HK4,6 (Fig. 3-A, B). Therefore, HA-DAF interaction modulates virulence, without impacting

296

in viral replication or clearance in vivo.

297

As HA is involved in adhesion of viral particles to host cells, we asked if differences

298

in HA would impact tissue penetration. As observed in PR8-HK4,6 infected mice, IHC of

299

NP and quantification of infected bronchioli showed no difference in infection levels and

300

patterns between Daf-/- and WT mice (Fig. 5-E, F), indicating that HA-DAF interaction has

301

no role in this context. Additionally, analysis of tissue damage showed that histological

302

scores between Daf-/- and WT mice were similar at 3 d.p.i. (4.7±3.5 vs. 4.1±2.8) (Fig. 5-G),

303

but significantly reduced in Daf-/- mice when compared to WT at 6 d.p.i. (7.4±3.7 vs.

304

10.9±2.8) (Fig. 5-H). These results show that HA-DAF interaction contributes to disease

305

severity and worse disease outcome observed in WT mice, but does not impact lung

306

tissue damage and hence does not completely explain the protective effect of DAF

307

absence.

308

To better understand the role of HA-DAF interaction in disease outcome, we

309

analyzed complement and immune cell recruitment in the lungs of PR8-HK6 infected mice.

310

Interestingly C3-/- and C3-/- / Daf-/- mice had similar bodyweight loss when infected with

311

PR8-HK6 (Fig. 6-A), and the levels of C3a were reduced in BALs of Daf-/- mice when

312

compared to their WT counterparts (178.4±36.8ng/mL vs. 405.8±99.2ng/mL) (Fig. 6-B).

313

These observations correspond to what was seen in PR8-HK4,6 infection and indicate that

314

different HA-DAF interactions do not elicit different complement responses.

315

Analysis of lung immune cell recruitment in PR8-HK6 infected mice showed that at 3

316

d.p.i. levels of neutrophils and monocytes were identical between Daf-/- and WT mice (Fig.

317

6-C, D). At 6 d.p.i, however, Daf-/- mice had lower numbers of neutrophils and monocytes

318

when compared to their WT counterparts (58.6±21.3% vs. 100±36.41% neutrophils;

319

61.4±19.6% vs. 100±41.45% monocytes) (Fig. 6-E, F) showing that a change in HA does

320

not alter the innate immune cell recruitment observed in PR8-HK4,6. Of note, the levels of

321

CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were decreased in PR8-HK6 infected Daf-/- mice when compared

322

to their WT counterparts (57.5±26.2% vs. 100±35.9% CD4+ T cells and 49.3±36.7% vs.

323

100±50.5% CD8+ T cells) (Fig. 6-G, H), contrarily to what was seen in PR8-HK4,6 infection

324

(Fig. 4-I, J) and showing that HA-DAF interaction modulates the adaptive immune

325

response.

326

Taken together, our data is consistent with the HA-DAF interaction controlling

327

disease severity, without impacting complement or innate immune responses leading to

328

immunopathology. It does, however, impact the recruitment of T cells. The decreased

329

activation of the adaptive immune response, together with the higher virulence of this

330

strain may exceed the beneficial effect of reduced tissue damage and explain the similar

331

mortality in Daf-/- and WT mice.

332

As HA-DAF interaction did not impact complement nor innate immune responses, we

333

proceeded with analysis of NA-DAF interactions. Following the principle stated above,

334

analyses were done in comparison with PR8-HK4,6 and not PR8 and thus the removal of

335

HK6 from PR8-HK4,6 allowed assessing the role of different NAs. Therefore, to

336

understand the contribution of NA in the protection conferred by DAF depletion, Daf-/- and

337

WT mice were infected with sublethal and lethal doses of PR8-HK4. Upon infection with

338

this strain, Daf-/- mice showed a reduced bodyweight loss when compared to the WT mice

339

(17.7% vs. 21.8% maximum bodyweight loss) (Fig. 7-A). The detrimental effect of DAF

340

was more evident when mice were challenged with lethal doses. Indeed, 87.5% of WT

341

mice succumbed to infection with 250 PFU of PR8-HK4, whereas all of Daf-/- mice survived

342

(Fig. 7-B). As these results correspond to what was observed with PR8-HK4,6, NA-DAF

343

interaction does not directly impact disease severity.

344

Similarly, lung viral loads were identical in Daf-/- and WT mice infected with PR8-HK4 both

345

at 3 (2.2±1.9 x 106 PFU/g vs. 4.1±5.5 x 106 PFU/g) and 6 d.p.i. (8.8±9.9 PFU/g x 104 vs.

346

6.1±4.1 x 104 PFU/g). Also, PR8-HK4 infection foci were mainly restricted to the alveoli

347

with no difference at the level of infected bronchioli in Daf-/- and WT mice lung sections

348

(25.8±8.3% vs. 24.2±13.6%) (Fig. 7-E, F). These results show that NA-DAF interaction

349

does not impact viral replication, clearance or tissue penetration. Interestingly, further

350

analysis of PR8-HK4 infected lungs showed that the lungs of Daf-/- mice were more

351

damaged at 3 d.p.i. with a histological score of 4.3±0.9, when compared to lungs from WT

352

mice that had a score of 2.9±1.5. At 6 d.p.i. this difference was no longer present, Daf-/-

353

lungs having a score of 8.3±3.8, and WT of 9.2±3.1. Hence PR8-HK4 infected Daf-/- mice

354

have more lung tissue damage at an early time point in infection, when compared to WT

355

mice, and oppositely to what was observed in PR8-HK4,6 infection. NA-DAF interaction

356

would then control lung immunopathology in this context, but with no real consequence in

357

disease outcome, as Daf-/- still had decreased bodyweight loss and mortality when

358

compared to the WT.

359

To better understand the mechanism behind this observation, we started by

360

assessing the role of complement. C3-/- / Daf-/- and C3-/- mice had a similar bodyweight loss

361

upon PR8-HK4 infection (Fig. 8-A), and Daf-/- mice had significantly lower levels of C3a

362

detected in BALs at 6 d.p.i. when compared to their WT counterparts (194.4±115.6 ng/mL

363

vs. 506.4±180.2 ng/mL) (Fig. 8-B). These results confirm that, similarly to what was

364

observed in PR8-HK4,6 and PR8-HK6 infections, the protection of Daf-/- mice upon PR8-

365

HK4 infection is complement mediated, and Daf-/- mice might be protected via lower levels

366

of complement activation.

367

We then proceeded with analysis of immune cell recruitment to the lungs at 3 and 6

368

d.p.i.. At 3 d.p.i., Daf-/- mice had reduced levels of neutrophils but not monocytes when

369

compared to their WT counterparts (16.2±8.6% vs. 100±112.1% neutrophils; 38.1±21.1%

370

vs. 100±79.5% monocytes) (Fig. 8-C, D).

371

comparable levels of both neutrophils and monocytes, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 8-

372

E-J) (105.0±62.9% vs. 100±49.2% neutrophils; 104.5±54.0% vs. 100±49.1% monocytes;

373

106±67.0% vs. 100±61.7% CD4+ T cells; 104.3±60.6% vs. 100±52.6% CD8+ T cells).

374

These results do not correspond to what was observed in infections with PR8-HK4,6,

375

where the main differences between Daf-/- and WT mice resided in reduced numbers of

376

monocytes at 3 d.p.i., and reduced numbers of both neutrophils and monocytes at 6 d.p.i.

377

(Fig. 4-E-H). We can therefore conclude that different NA elicit different innate immune

378

responses, and that NA-DAF interaction is responsible for the recruitment of innate

379

immune cells.

Then, at 6 d.p.i., Daf-/- and WT mice had

380

In summary, Daf-/- mice are protected from PR8-HK4 infection with decreased

381

complement levels and reduced neutrophil recruitment but increased immunopathology

384

neutrophil recruitment reflects what was observed in PR8-HK4,6 infection, albeit at an

385

earlier time point. One might then suggest that NA-DAF interaction is important in

386

regulation of neutrophil recruitment, and that these cells play an important role in

387

modulating disease outcome. Taken together, our results demonstrate that both HA and

388

NA play a role in disease severity, and that the cumulative effect of both HA- and NA-DAF

389

interactions results in the mechanism worsening the outcome observed upon Cal, Eng and

PR8-HK4,6 infections.

mice regarding both lung tissue damage and immune cell recruitment. The reduction in

391
392

Influenza A virus NA cleaves DAF through its sialidase activity

393

NA is an widely studied sialidase with described roles in mucus penetration, cell egress

394

and recently even in viral entry (50). Remarkably, NA has also been reported to cleave

395

sialic acid residues from exogenous proteins inside the cell (51). As DAF is a highly

396

sialylated protein, we hypothesized that the interaction between DAF and NA resided in

397

the ability of NA to cleave DAF’s sialic acid content. Sialic acids that reside on cell surface

398

glycoproteins and glycolipids are the receptors for IAV, recognized by HA for viral entry

399

and cleaved by NA for viral exit (52). In order to assess cleavage of DAF’s sialic acid

400

content, we infected a human alveolar cell line (A549) with Cal, Eng, PR8 and PR8-HK4,6,

401

and analyzed DAF content by western blot. We observed that in infected cells the band

402

marked by the anti-DAF antibody was at a lower molecular weight (MW) than in mock-

403

infected cells (Fig. 9-A). This difference in MW is of nearly 18 kDa, which corresponds to

404

DAF sialic acid content (53) and suggests that infection leads to loss of said content.

405

Quantification of this cleavage confirmed that it is dependent on infection and progressive

406

over time. Interestingly, the extent of DAF cleavage is not identical in cells infected with

407

different IAV strains, PR8 infected cells presenting the most drastic effect (Fig. 9-B).

408

Protein glycosylation type and levels may greatly vary between organisms (54). As

409

previous results were obtained using human cell lines, we wanted to confirm that infection

410

with the tested strains would remove the sialic acid content of murine DAF. For that

411

purpose, we collected mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from WT mice and infected

412

them with the laboratory adapted strains PR8 and PR8-HK4,6. Similarly to what was

413

shown in a human cell line infection, murine DAF in infected MEFs suffered a drop in MW,

414

when compared to non-infected cells (Fig. 9-C). Moreover, the differences in cleavage

415

efficacy between PR8 and PR8-HK4,6 were maintained (Fig. 9-D), showing that IAV is

416

able to process murine DAF and giving an insight to what may be triggering complement

417

activation in vivo.

418

To show that NA mediates processing of DAF and discard the involvement of other viral

419

proteins, we transfected HEK293T cells with eight different plasmids, each encoding a

420

different PR8 genomic segment. As expected, cleavage only occurred when cells were

421

transfected with segment 6, which encodes for NA, showing that NA is the only viral

422

protein responsible for the reduction in DAF MW (Fig. 9-E). To confirm that this drop in

423

MW was indeed the result of direct enzymatic activity of NA, we introduced the mutation

424

E229A in PR8 segment 6, which pronouncedly decreases NA enzymatic activity, while still

425

sustaining a low level of viral replication (55). Using the RG technique as mentioned

426

above, we created a PR8 strain containing the mutated NA: PR8 NA-E229A. Analysis of

427

DAF in cells transfected with the eight RG plasmids required for producing the passage 0

428

virus showed that, by impairing NA sialidase activity, DAF cleavage was prevented (Fig. 9-

429

H). Taken together, these results confirm that DAF cleavage observed upon infection is

430

due solely to NA sialidase activity.

431

As NA is a transmembrane protein with potential to cleave sialic acids at the cell surface,

432

but also in the cytoplasm while en route to the plasma membrane, we questioned where

433

DAF cleavage was taking place. For that, PR8 infected A549 cells were treated with a non-

18

434

permeable NA inhibitor, Zanamivir. We observed that Zanamivir treatment reduced the

435

proportion of cleaved DAF (0.60 vs. 0.75), showing that DAF cleavage happens in part at

436

the cell membrane, and in part in the cytoplasm (Fig. 9-F, G).

437

NA unprecedented direct and pronounced effect on DAF strongly suggests a functional

438

consequence. It has been proposed that DAF negatively charged sialic acids function as a

439

spacer, which projects DAF RCA domains to the extracellular milieu (56). Additionally,

440

sialic acid removal promotes DAF to be proteolytically shed (35). Therefore, we

441

hypothesized that NA-mediated sialic acid cleavage would result in DAF loss/alteration of

442

function, resulting in increased complement activity. To test this, we produced lentiviral

443

vectors to deliver WT or E229A versions of PR8 NA fused to GFP. After transduction of

444

A549 cells, we treated cells with normal human serum and stained for C5b-9 as a proxy for

445

complement activation. Transduction of cells with WT NA resulted in increased C5b-9

446

deposition when compared with cells transduced with E229A (1±0.7 vs. 0.3±0.2) (Fig. 9-I).

447

Therefore, NA removal of DAF sialic acid content does impair its complement regulator

448

function, increasing complement activation.

449

For IAV receptor recognition, the binding of sialic acid to the penultimate galactose

450

residues of carbohydrate side chains is important, and different IAVs exhibit preference for

451

Neu5Ac α(2,3)-Gal (hereafter α2,3-) or Neu5Ac α(2,6)-Gal (hereafter α2,6-) conformations

452

(57,58). Interestingly, most avian IAVs bind preferentially to sialic acid joined to the sugar

453

chain through an α2,3-linkage, whereas human IAV preferentially use α2,6-linked sialic

454

acid as a cellular receptor (58,59). To assess which type of ligations were cleaved by NA,

455

we infected A549 cells with PR8 and purified DAF by immunoprecipitation. Subsequently,

456

we treated immunoprecipitated DAF with PNGaseF to remove N-glycans, and probed DAF

457

by western blot and lectin blot with Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), which detects 2,6-

458

linked sialic acid (Fig. 9-J). The cumulative effect in DAF MW decrease of PR8 infection

459

and PNGaseF treatment, as well as loss of SNA staining only upon infection, indicates that

460

PR8 infection specifically removes 2,6-linked sialic acid from DAF O-glycans.

461

The affinity of the IAV HA and NA for respective sialic acid conformation is one of the host

462

species restriction factors (60), avian strains preferring α2,3-linked sialic acids, whereas

463

human strains are able to cleave 2,6-linked sialic acids. In accordance with that,

464

transfection of HEK293T cells with avian-adapted NAs did not impact DAF MW (Fig. 9-K).

465

Remarkably, transfection with NAs from a H7N9 isolated from a human patient

466

(A/Anhui/1/2013) and from a H5N6 isolated from a chicken (A/chicken/Jiangxi/02.05

467

YGYXG023-P/2015) caused a drop in DAF MW. These two NAs are thus able cleave

468

2,6-linked sialic acid residues, indicating they are already adapted to human sialic acid

469

linkages and indeed both H7N9 (61,62) and H5N6 (63,64) strains have been shown to

470

cause severe zoonotic disease. These results suggest that analysis of sialic acid cleavage

471

might be worth exploring as a measure for host adaptation and zoonotic events.

472

Overall, our results unveil DAF as a novel host virulence factor upon IAV infection,

473

depending on interaction with HA and NA. Specifically, we observed a widespread direct

474

interaction between NA and DAF with functional implications, which is an unprecedented

475

way of a virus, via altering a host protein from within the infected cell, modulating the

476

immune response.

Discussion

479
480

This work highlights the importance of a balanced immune response to viral

481

infections in order to clear the disease without causing immunopathology. Despite its

482

intrinsic protective role, complement is a documented driver of immunopathology in severe

483

viral infections such as IAV (31–33), SARS-CoV-2 (28–30) and MERS (27). In the context

484

of IAV, inhibition of different components of the complement system such as C3a receptor

485

and C5 decreased immune cell recruitment and activation leading to an ameliorated

486

disease outcome (31–33). Our work is in accordance with these studies as Daf-/- mice

487

have less severe disease upon IAV infection, coupled with reduced C3a levels in BALs,

488

and a lower number of immune cells recruited to the lungs (Fig. 4-A, B, 6-A, B, 8-A, B).

489

However, C3 is essential in IAV infection. C3-/- and C3-/- / Daf-/- mice had increased

490

mortality when compared to the WT (Fig. 3-A; 6-A; 8-A) and C3-/- mice presented

491

increased lung inflammation and infiltration of immune cells upon IAV infection (47,65).

492

These observations show the potential of regulating complement activation as a strategy

493

to provide resilience to viral infections, without affecting pathogen clearance.

494

Interestingly, infection of Cd59-/- mice and analysis of CDC in WT and Daf-/- primary lung

495

cells indicated that the last step of the complement cascade does not impact disease

496

outcome in IAV infection (Fig. 2-E, F; 4-C; S2-F, G). Rather, it suggests that earlier

497

components of the complement cascade, such as anaphylatoxins C3a and/or C5a have a

498

modulatory role of IAV virulence. This hypothesis agrees with the function of C3a and C5a

499

as recruiters and activators of the innate immune response, which can lead to

500

immunopathology (31–33). Our results indicate that, in fact, and contrary to expected, in

501

IAV infection, lack of DAF leads to reduced activation of complement, lower levels of C3a

502

and decreased recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils, specifically. The lower levels of

503

C3a detected in the BALs of Daf-/- mice could explain the lower numbers of innate immune

innate immune cells, without changing the levels of C3a in Daf-/- mice. These results

507

indicate that complement is not the sole recruiter and activator of the immune response,

508

and that a direct or indirect HA-DAF and/or NA-DAF interaction has additional roles to play

509

in immune cell recruitment.

510

In fact, we found that HA-DAF interplay impacts recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ T

511

cells, both of which shown to be essential in the clearance of IAV (66). The lower levels of

512

these cells in Daf-/- mice might annul the beneficial effect of lower lung tissue damage

513

observed at 6 d.p.i.. Indeed, upon PR8-HK6 challenge, mice bodyweight rapidly dropped

514

at 7 d.p.i., whereas in infection with other viral strains loss of weight started around 4 d.p.i.

515

and was more gradual, suggesting that the adaptive immune system is implicated in the

516

process (9,67). Despite HA being amongst the most immunogenic proteins of IAV, and

517

hence its involvement in adaptive immune response not surprising (67,68), our work

518

shows for the first time a specific interaction of HA with DAF and the implications of this

519

axis in T cell recruitment.

520

We also identified a novel function for the viral protein NA, via cleaving sialic acids

521

of DAF and modulating immune cell recruitment and viral pathogenicity. Remarkably, NA-

522

mediated cleavage of another host protein, latent TGF-β, activates it, which confers a

523

protective role upon infection (69,70). Here we found that NA cleaves α2,6-linked sialic

524

acids from DAF and hypothesize that this could explain the differences in the numbers of

525

neutrophils and monocytes recruited to the site of infection. Ablation of neutrophils in IAV

526

infections have been shown to prevent tissue damage without affecting viral loads (71–74).

527

In fact, these cells have long been associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome

528

(75), and extensive neutrophil infiltration and release of neutrophil extracellular traps

529

(NETs) have been linked to increased pneumonia severity in critical cases of COVID-19

530

(76–78). Despite these observations, neutrophils are important to the host response

531

against IAV infection as neutrophil depletion resulted in exacerbated viral loads, lung

532

damage and mortality in mice infected with PR8-HK4,6 (79,80). In addition to neutrophils,

533

monocytes are readily recruited to sites of IAV challenge where they differentiate into

534

macrophages or dendritic cells (DC) (81,82) that share many properties with their

535

conventional counterparts (83) and have been studied upon IAV infection (83,84).

536

Monocyte-derived macrophages contribute to the inflammation resolution by clearing

537

apoptotic neutrophils and confer lasting protection against secondary bacterial infections

538

(84,85). The interaction with apoptotic neutrophils has also been reported to increase

539

differentiation of monocytes into DC, promoting adherence of CD8+ T cells (85).

540

Conversely, monocyte and monocyte-derived cells may contribute to immunopathology, as

541

their depletion decreased disease severity without altering viral loads (86–88). These

542

studies show that both cell types are essential for IAV infection but can contribute to tissue

543

damage, and support our hypothesis that increased immunopathology of WT mice upon

544

IAV infection is mediated by excessive recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes.

545

The link we identified via NA, DAF and complement establishes a viral mediated

546

mechanism for maintaining inflammation via increasing the recruitment of immune cells.

547

The model that we propose and that is depicted in Figure 10 explores an interplay

548

between HA and NA in modulating the immune response. Previous examples include the

549

activation of the NK cell sialylated receptors NKp44 and NKp46 by HA at the surface of

550

infected cells, which is countered by NA-mediated desialylation (89,90). In the case of our

551

work, it is known that apical delivery of NA to the cell surface is potentiated by HA (91) and

552

during this transport (and also at the plasma membrane), NA would cleave DAF sialic acid

553

giving rise to increased activation of complement. Indeed, we observed that IAV infection

554

induces a drop in DAF MW over the course of infection both in human and murine cell

555

lines. The drop corresponds to DAF sialic acid content, and NA is necessary and sufficient

556

for this cleavage (Fig. 9-A, C, E, H and J). Moreover, transduction of cells with NA and

557

thus removal of DAF sialic acid content resulted in an increased C5b-9 deposition (Fig. 9-

558

I). We propose that the removal of DAF sialic acid content would not lead to a loss of

559

function, but instead trigger an exaggerated complement response. This is contrary to

560

what is observed for autoimmune diseases, for which Daf-/- mice have been widely used

561

(92–94). These mice have increased disease severity coupled with high complement

562

activation levels when compared to their WT counterparts, showing that Daf-/- mice do not

563

lack the ability to activate the complement and that the mechanism we now describe could

564

be shared among viruses containing promiscuous NAs. As an alternative, NA-mediated

565

DAF cleavage could result in the recruitment of innate immune cells by exposing “non-self”

566

glycans at cell surface, which has been shown to activate complement via the lectin

567

pathway (95). Besides complement, it could also be recognized by different PRRs (96). At

568

the moment this hypothesis is speculative but raises concerns about using therapies, such

569

as DAS181 (97), aiming at decreasing sialic acid levels at cell surface to prevent viral

570

entry. Interestingly, our work indicates that NA cleavage of sialic acids does not happen

571

solely at the cell surface, but also in the cytoplasm, as treatment with Zanamivir did not

572

completely abolish DAF cleavage (Fig. 9-F). To the best of our knowledge, this mechanism

573

has not been reported before.

574

DAF cleavage provides a possible link between DAF-NA interaction and in vivo

575

pathology. Given that our study shows that sialic acids cleaved by DAF are α2,6-linked to

576

O-glycans, this mechanism may have implications in host species jumps, as for example,

577

IAV adapted to birds exhibit preference for α2,3-linked sialic acids.

578

present evidence that NAs derived from two avian-adapted strains, H5N6 and H7N9, were

579

able to cleave human DAF (Fig. 9-J). As H7N9 and H5N6 outbreaks provoked severe

580

infections in humans, associated with exacerbated immune response (61–63),

24

Interestingly, we

581

hypothetically establishing DAF cleavage as a hallmark of virulence could be a useful tool

582

to monitor viruses with pandemic potential.

583

In addition, many host proteins including mucins are decorated by sialic acids. Mucins

584

form an important barrier at the cell surface preventing viral entry (98). These proteins are

585

also heavily glycosylated, specifically at the terminal part of O-glycans (99), similarly to

586

DAF, indicating that they could be substrates of NA. As a consequence, the mechanism

587

we describe could be used to manipulate the extracellular environment and facilitate viral

588

cell-to-cell transmission. Identification of glycans exposed at the surface of infected cells

589

and their interaction with viral proteins may help understand the balance between viral

590

entry and immune response targets and reveal disease resilience pathways prone to

591

therapeutic intervention.

1226

At steady state, DAF accelerates the decay of C3 convertases, inhibiting the

1227

formation of C3a and C3b and subsequent complement activation. Upon IAV infection, the

1228

cell will produce viral proteins, and in particular NA. NA is a potent sialidase that will

1229

remove the sialic acid content of DAF both in the cytoplasm and at the surface. This

1230

processing of DAF by NA leads to DAF loss/alteration of function and hence overactivation

1231

of the complement pathway that will recruit innate immune cells. The excess of innate
