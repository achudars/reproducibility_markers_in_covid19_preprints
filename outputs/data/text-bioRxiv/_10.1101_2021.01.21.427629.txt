Abstract

23

Wild animals have been implicated as the origin of SARS-CoV-2, but it is largely unknown how

24

the virus affects most wildlife species and if wildlife could ultimately serve as a reservoir for

25

maintaining the virus outside the human population. Here we show that several common

26

peridomestic species, including deer mice, bushy-tailed woodrats, and striped skunks, are

27

susceptible to infection and can shed the virus in respiratory secretions. In contrast, we

28

demonstrate that cottontail rabbits, fox squirrels, Wyoming ground squirrels, black-tailed prairie

29

dogs, house mice, and racoons are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our work expands

30

upon the existing knowledge base of susceptible species and provides evidence that human-

31

wildlife interactions could result in continued transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

33

Introduction

34
35

The rapid global expansion of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2

36

(SARS-CoV-2) has been unprecedented in modern history. While the original human

37

infection(s) were potentially linked to wild animals in a wet market (1), human-to-human

38

transmission is currently the dominant mechanism of viral spread. Peridomestic animals, which

39

are represented by wild and feral animals living within close proximity to humans, represent key

40

species to evaluate for SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology for multiple reasons. First, given their

41

common associations with humans and anthropogenically modified habitats, they represent the

42

wildlife species with the greatest chance of exposure to the virus from humans (i.e., reverse

43

zoonosis) or pets such as cats. Second, should select peridomestic wildlife prove to be

44

susceptible to the virus and have the capacity to replicate it to high viral titers, these species

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.21.427629; this version posted January 21, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

45

would have the potential to maintain the virus among conspecifics. Third, should some species

46

possess the maintenance host criteria mentioned above, they would represent wildlife species

47

that would have the greatest chance (e.g., shedding ability and proximity to humans) to spread

48

the virus back to humans. Wild rodents, cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus sp.), raccoons (Procyon

49

lotor) and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) can exhibit peridomestic tendencies in urban and

50

suburban environments. Members of all these species/taxonomic groups have been shown to

51

shed influenza A viruses following experimental inoculations (2,3,4), suggesting they might

52

harbor productive infections when exposed to other human-pathogenic respiratory viruses.

53
54

Based upon protein analyses of amino acid residues of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and S protein,

55

species susceptibility analyses suggested that, among other taxonomic groups, both carnivores

56

and wild rodents are potentially high-risk groups (5,6,7). Predicting specific species’

57

susceptibility, however, is more challenging. Looking at protein sequence analysis of ACE2

58

binding with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, one study indicated that raccoons could be ruled out

59

as potential hosts for SARS-CoV-2 (6) and a different study based upon sequence analysis

60

suggested that the western spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis) had a very low prediction of

61

SARS-CoV-2 S-binding propensity (7). Similarly, the same study also suggested that American

62

mink (Neovison vison) have a similar prediction as western spotted skunks (7). However, over

63

the last several months, outbreaks of SAR-CoV-2 in commercial mink farms have been noted in

64

Europe and more recently in the U.S. (8,9). Respiratory problems, rapid transmission, and/or

65

unusually high mortality have been noted in this species in various regions (9,10), which

66

suggests that the aforementioned analyses have limitations.

68

Rodents are the largest and most diverse order of mammals, so it is unsurprising that the

69

susceptibility of rodents to SARS-CoV-2 varies by species. To date, only a handful of rodent

70

species have been evaluated as potential reservoir hosts or animal models for SARS-CoV-2, and

71

the results largely indicate that outbred species, including lab animals, are at most only

72

moderately affected. Most non-transgenic laboratory mice (Mus musculus) are resistant to

73

infection, while transgenic humanized mice and hamsters, including Syrian hamsters

74

(Mesocricetus auratus) and dwarf hamsters (Phodopus sp.), are highly susceptible, with at least

75

one report of Roborovky’s dwarf hamsters becoming fatally diseased within three days of

76

exposure (11,12,13). Other species, including deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), become

77

infected and shed low titers of virus, but the infection is subclinical (14,15). Considering that

78

there are more than 1700 species of rodents world-wide, many of which exist closely at the

79

human-wildlife interface, there remain many unanswered questions about SARS-CoV-2 and wild

80

rodents.

81
82

Various lagomorphs exist as pets, livestock, and peridomestic wildlife, and as such are in

83

prime position to come into contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected humans. In one study, New

84

Zealand white rabbits were experimentally infected and shed infectious virus for up to seven

85

days without signs of clinical disease (16) Wild rabbits, particularly cottontails in the U.S., are

86

prolific and commonly found around human dwellings, farms, and commercial buildings.

87

Further, as with rodents, wild rabbits are highly likely to be predated upon by domestic cats.

88

Thus, determining the susceptibility of these animals is critically important to interpreting the

89

risk posed to them and by them from infection with SARS-CoV-2.

90

Among carnivores, felids and mustelids have been frequently linked to SARS-CoV-2

91

infections since the early stages of the pandemic. Domestic cats are highly susceptible to SARS-

92

CoV-2 and are capable of transmitting the virus to other cats, suggesting that they could

93

potentially transmit to other animals as well (17,18). While striped skunks are currently

94

considered to be mephitids, they are highly related to mammals within the family mustelidae and

95

were formerly classified as mustelids. Thus, based on the findings of SARS-CoV-2

96

susceptibility in various mustelids, the closely related mephitids are a logical candidate to

97

evaluate for the replication of this virus. Raccoons are notoriously associated with human

98

environments and frequently interact with human trash and sewage, which has been proposed as

99

a potential indirect means for infected humans to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to mammalian wildlife

100

(e.g., raccoons and select mustelids) (19,20,21). Thus, it is important to determine the relative

101

susceptibility of these common peridomestic carnivores and assess the likelihood that they could

102

propagate infection.

103
104

In this study, we assessed six common peridomestic rodent species for susceptibility to

105

SARS-CoV-2: deer mice, wild-caught house mice (Mus musculus), bushy-tailed woodrats (aka

106

“pack rats”; Neotoma cinerea), fox squirrels (Sciurus niger), Wyoming ground squirrels

107

(Urocitellus elegans), and black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). These rodents are

108

common in many parts of the United States, several of them frequently come into close contact

109

with humans and human dwellings, and some are highly social animals, thus increasing the

110

likelihood of pathogen transmission among conspecifics. In addition, we evaluated three other

111

common peridomestic mammals: cottontail rabbits, raccoons, and striped skunks. Our results

112

indicate that 33% (3/9) of the species evaluated are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection,

suggesting that wildlife may become critically implicated in the continued persistence of the

virus.

118

Animals

119

The following mixed-sex animals were evaluated for susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2: Deer mice,

120

house mice, bushy-tailed woodrats, Wyoming ground squirrels, black-tailed prairie dogs, fox

121

squirrels, cottontail rabbits, striped skunks, and raccoons. Deer mice, house mice and bushy-

122

tailed woodrats were trapped using Sherman traps baited with grain. Wyoming ground squirrels,

123

fox squirrels, black-tailed prairie dogs, and cottontails were trapped using Tomahawk live traps

124

(e.g., 7 x 7 x 20 or 7 x 7 x 24). All trapping was done in Northern Colorado (Larimer, Jackson

125

and Weld counties) in accordance with Colorado wildlife regulations and with appropriate

126

permits in place. Skunks and raccoons were purchased from a private vendor. Animals were

127

housed in an Animal Biosafety Level-3 (ABSL3) facility at Colorado State University, in

128

12’x18’ rooms with natural lighting and controlled climate. Mice, black-tailed prairie dogs, and

129

Wyoming ground squirrels were group housed by species with ad libitum access to water and

130

food. All other animals were housed individually with access to food and water ad libitum.

131

Rodents were maintained on Teklad® Rodent Diet (Enviro, Madison, WI) supplemented with

132

fresh fruit and occasional nuts. Rabbits were fed alfalfa pellets (Manna Pro® Corp, Denver,

133

Colorado) supplemented with grass hay and apples. Skunks and raccoons were maintained on

134

Mazuri® Omnivore Diet (Mazuri Exotic Animal Nutrition, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with

135

fresh fruit and occasional eggs. Raccoons, striped skunks and black-tailed prairie dogs were

136

implanted with thermally-sensitive microchips (Bio-Thermo Lifechips, Destron-Fearing) for

137

identification and temperature measurement, deer mice were ear notched; all other animals were

138

identified by cage number or distinct markings.

139

Virus

140

SARS-CoV-2 virus strain WA1/2020WY96 was obtained from BEI Resources (Manassas, VA,

141

USA), passaged twice in Vero E6 cells and stocks frozen at -80°C in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle

142

Medium (DMEM) with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Virus stock was titrated on Vero

143

cells using standard double overlay plaque assay (17) and plaques were counted 72 hours later to

144

determine plaque-forming units (pfu) per ml.

145
146

Virus challenge

147

Prior to challenge with SARS-CoV-2, most animals were lightly anesthetized as needed with 1-3

148

mg/kg xylazine and 10-30 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride (Zetamine™) and a blood sample

149

collected just before inoculation (Day 0). Virus diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was

150

administered to all species via pipette into the nares (50ul for deer and house mice, 100ul for

151

bushy-tailed woodrats, and 200ul for all other species) and animals were observed until fully

152

recovered from anesthesia. Virus back-titration was performed on Vero cells immediately

153

following inoculation, confirming that animals received between 4.5 and 4.9 log10 pfu of SARS-

154

CoV-2.

155
156

Sampling

157

Groups of three animals from each species (two for ground squirrels) were used for preliminary

158

studies to evaluate viral shedding and acute pathological changes. For these animals, oral swabs

159

were obtained pre-challenge and on days 1-3 post-challenge, at which time animals were

160

euthanized and the following tissues harvested for virus isolation and formalin fixation: trachea,

161

nasal turbinates, lung, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, small intestine, and olfactory bulb. The

162

exception to this was raccoons, for which only one animal was euthanized at day 3; the

163

remaining two were kept through day 28 to evaluate serological response. The remaining 3-6

164

animals per select species were swabbed daily from days 0-5 and 7 to further evaluate duration

165

of viral shedding (if any). Striped skunks and raccoons were sedated for all sampling and a nasal

166

swab was collected in addition to the oral swab. Tissues harvested from animals euthanized on

167

day 7 were evaluated as for the day 3 animals. The remaining animals were euthanized at 28

168

days post-infection (DPI) and tissues were harvested for histopathology and serum was collected

169

for serology. Table 1 illustrates the necropsy scheme for each species.

Clinical observations

176

Clinical evaluations were performed for all animals daily and included assessment for

177

temperament and presence of any clinical signs of disease, such as ocular discharge, nasal

178

discharge, ptyalism, coughing/sneezing, dyspnea, diarrhea, lethargy, anorexia, and if moribund.

179

The stress of handling wild animals for sampling precluded the ability to obtain accurate body

all species except skunks and raccoons, which were implanted with thermal microchips and

182

could be measured under sedation during sampling.

183
184

Viral assays

185

Virus isolation was performed on all oral swab, nasal swab and 3 DPI tissue samples by double

186

overlay plaque assay on Vero cells as previously described (17). Briefly, 6-well plates with

187

confluent monolayers of cells were washed once with PBS and inoculated with 100 µl of serial

188

10-fold dilutions of samples, incubated for 1 hour at 37oC, and overlaid with a 0.5% agarose in

189

MEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics/antifungal agents. A second overlay with

190

neutral red dye was added at 48 hours and plaques were counted at 72 hours. Viral titers were

191

reported as the log10 pfu per swab (oropharyngeal/nasal) or per gram (tissue).

192
193

Serology

194

Plaque reduction neutralization assays (PRNT) were performed as previously described (17).

195

Serum was heat-inactivated for 30 mins at 56oC, and two-fold dilutions prepared in BA-1 (Tris-

196

buffered MEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin) starting at a 1:5 dilution were aliquoted

197

onto 96-well plates. An equal volume of virus was added to the serum dilutions and incubated

198

for 1 hour at 37oC. Following incubation, serum-virus mixtures were plated onto Vero

199

monolayers as described for virus isolation assays. Antibody titers were recorded as the

200

reciprocal of the highest dilution in which >90% of virus was neutralized.

201
202

qRT-PCR

203

Plaques were picked from culture plates from each positive animal to confirm SARS-CoV-2

204

viral shedding. RNA extractions were performed per the manufacturer’s instructions using

205

Qiagen QiaAmp Viral RNA mini kits. RT-PCR was performed as recommended using the

206

E_Sarbeco primer probe sequence as described by Corman and colleagues (22) and the

207

Superscript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR system (Invitrogen), with the following

208

modification: the initial reverse transcription was at 50oC. RNA standards for PCR were obtained

209

from BEI Resources (Manassas, VA, USA).

218

Viral shedding

219

Of the nine species evaluated, three (deer mice, bushy-tailed woodrats, and striped skunks) shed

220

infectious virus following challenge (Figure 1). Deer mice, which have previously been

221

demonstrated to shed infectious SARS-CoV-2 experimentally (15 Griffin), shed virus orally for

222

up to four days and virus was isolated from lungs (n=3/3) and trachea (n=2/3) from animals

223

harvested at 3 DPI. All nine inoculated deer mice shed virus on at least two of the first four days

224

following infection, with peak titers of 3.1 log10 pfu/swab. Bushy-tailed woodrats shed virus

225

orally for up to five days post inoculation (n=6/6) and virus was isolated from turbinates (n=2/3),

226

trachea (n=1/3) and lung (n=1/3) from animals necropsied on 3 DPI. Peak titers from bushy-

227

tailed woodrats reached 3.0 log10 pfu/swab by 3 DPI. Interestingly, the single bushy-tailed

228

woodrat for which infectious virus was isolated from the lungs only shed 1.3 log10 pfu/swab

229

orally on the day of necropsy, but the lungs contained 5.2 log10 pfu/gram virus. Striped skunks,

230

which had to be handled under heavy sedation, were sampled on days 1-3, 5, and 7, during which

231

time three of the six infected animals shed orally, nasally, or both, with one animal shedding up

232

to 7 DPI. Of the three skunks necropsied on 3 DPI, two had infectious virus in the turbinates, but

233

not in other tissues tested. One of those two animals had 3.2 log10 pfu/gram in the turbinates but

234

failed to shed detectable virus nasally or orally prior to euthanasia. In general, viral titers were

235

slightly higher in nasal samples compared to oral, but overall peak titers in skunks were

236

relatively low, with oral titers reaching 2 log10 pfu/swab and nasal flush titers at 2.3 log10

237

pfu/swab. All animals with plaque-assay positive samples were confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 by

238

RT-PCR. Similarly, all animals that were negative on plaque assay were confirmed negative for

239

viral shedding by RT-PCR.

Seroconversion

246

All animals were seronegative against SARS-CoV-2 at the time of inoculation (<50% viral

247

neutralization at 1:10 serum dilution). Based on the lack of evidence of infection and the overall

248

difficulty of maintaining wildlife, we opted not to hold subsets of squirrels or rabbits for

249

additional time to assess seroconversion. Neutralizing antibody titers were assessed in all

250

animals euthanized at 28 DPI, which included deer mice, house mice, bushy-tailed woodrats,

251

black-tailed prairie dogs, raccoons and striped skunks. All species which had detectable viral

252

infections (deer mice, skunks, and bushy-tailed woodrats) also developed neutralizing antibodies,

253

while the other species (house mice, raccoons, and black-tailed prairie dogs) did not. Deer mice

254

and bushy-tailed woodrats reached or exceeded titers of 1:80, and the two skunks that shed

255

infectious virus reached or exceeded titers of 1:160, while the single skunk that did not shed

256

virus had a titer of 1:10 at 28 DPI. Animals euthanized at 3 DPI were not tested for

257

seroconversion as previous investigations have demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies are

258

typically not detectable during acute infection (23).

259
260

Clinical disease

261

None of the animals exhibited clinical signs of disease (see methods for symptoms) at any time

262

during the study. Skunks and raccoons, which were sedated for procedures which involved

263

sampling, failed to display elevated temperatures at those times. In addition to clinical signs,

264

behavior was monitored by observing animals through double-paned glass and assessing eating

265

and response to provided enrichment (playing with toys, eating treats, using hides, etc.), and

266

none of the animals were observed to behave abnormally following infection when compared to

267

the acclimation period.

268
269

Pathology

270

None of the animals had gross lesions at the time of necropsy. On histopathologic examination,

271

Conclusions

277
278

COVID19 has had a significant impact on the human population globally, but so far very

279

little is known about how SARS-CoV-2 virus impacts wildlife. Domestic cats and dogs have

280

repeatedly been shown to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, but with few exceptions are

281

asymptomatic or develop mild clinical disease (17,24,25). Farmed mink, on the other hand, are

282

not only susceptible to infection, but can develop fulminating fatal disease (10,26). In contrast,

283

ferrets, which are closely related to mink, shed virus following infection but the infection is

284

subclinical (27). Raccoon dogs, which were heavily implicated in the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in

285

2004, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but remain subclinical (28). Experimentally,

286

deer mice can be infected and shed the virus via oral secretions, as demonstrated by this study

287

and others (14,15). However, other mice, including wild house mice and non-transgenic

288

laboratory strains of this species, are not susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 (29). Studies

289

in which bats and select small mammals were experimentally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 show

290

that some species (i.e., fruit bats [Rousettus aegyptiacus] and tree shrews [Tupaia belangeri]),

291

are capable of minimal viral replication while others (big brown bats [Eptesicus fuscus]) do not

292

appear to become infected at all, which suggests that while the virus may have originated in bats,

293

they are unlikely to serve as reservoir hosts (30,31,32). The confounding clinical response to

294

infection between closely related species makes predicting impacts on wildlife and their potential

295

for reservoir maintenance difficult. Despite best attempts to predict host susceptibility based on

296

receptor similarity or other modeling approaches, experimental infections remain the gold

297

standard for evaluating the susceptibility of an animal to infection and following the course of

298

disease.

299

Our results demonstrate that several common peridomestic wildlife species, including

300

deer mice, bushy-tailed woodrats, and striped skunks are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection

301

and can shed infectious virus. Importantly, our work and the work of others indicate that so far,

302

the majority of exposed wildlife species develop mild to no clinical disease and either fail to shed

303

virus at all or shed low levels for short durations. Perhaps equally important is that these

304

experimental infections suggest that we can rule out several common rodents, select wild

305

lagomorphs and raccoons as potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs. There are, however, limitations

306

to these experimental models, namely that the animals in our studies were directly exposed to

307

high doses (e.g., 5 log10 pfu) of virus, which is unlikely to be representative of an exposure in

308

nature. Additionally, experimental infections using low numbers of apparently healthy,

309

immunocompetent animals do not generate sufficient data to fully characterize the risk posed to

310

animals of varying ages and health status. However, the results of this work and the work of

311

others, combined with the dramatic response to infection seen in certain species such as mink,

312

indicate that the possibility exists of SARS-CoV-2 infecting wildlife, establishing a transmission

313

cycle, and becoming endemic in non-human species. In particular, the relatively high titers

314

observed in select woodrat tissues (e.g., 5.2 log10 pfu/gram of lung) suggests that a predator-prey

315

transmission scenario among this rodent species and various small wild and domestic carnivore

316

species is plausible. The major outcomes of such an event include direct threat to the health of

317

wildlife and establishment of a reservoir host, which could complicate control measures of this

318

virus in human populations. Experimental studies to identify and characterize species’ response

319

to SARS-CoV-2 infection help scientists classify those species that are at highest risk and allow

320

for the implementation of prevention measures. For example, both deer mice and bushy-tailed

321

woodrats are commonly found in barns and sheds in very close proximity to humans, so when

322

cleaning out sheds or attempting to rodent-proof barns, people should consider wearing

323

appropriate personal protective equipment, both to prevent exposure to the pathogens rodents

324

carry as well as to prevent exposing wildlife to SARS-CoV-2. Likewise, humans with COVID19

325

who also own cats and dogs should practice extra precaution with their pets, including

326

minimizing the pet’s exposure to wildlife. Notably, a photo-monitoring study provided evidence

327

that striped skunks can commonly use the same urban cover types (e.g., outbuildings and decks)

328

as domestic cats (33). Intentionally available pet food and spilled bird feed, which were two of

329

the attractants evaluated, produced instances where skunks and domestic cats were documented

330

to be on study sites simultaneously or nearly simultaneously, which could facilitate interspecies

331

transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

332

Wildlife and SARS-CoV-2 are intricately involved, from the initial spillover event to

333

potential reverse zoonosis, and we will undoubtedly continue to discover more susceptible

334

species as the search for zoonotic reservoirs continues. COVID19 is just the latest in a series of

335

examples of how the human-wildlife interface continues to drive the emergence of infectious

336

disease. The use of experimental research, surveillance, and modeling as tools for predicting

337

outbreaks and epidemics will hopefully provide the knowledge base and resources necessary to

338

prevent future pandemics.
