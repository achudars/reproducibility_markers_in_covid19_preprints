Abstract
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus- 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus
responsible for the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). No sustainable
treatment option is available so far to tackle such a public health threat. Therefore, designing a
suitable vaccine to overcome this hurdle asks for immediate attention. In this study, we targeted
for a design of multi-epitope based vaccine using immunoinformatics tools. We considered the
structural proteins S, E and, M of SARS-CoV-2, since they facilitate the infection of the virus
into host cell and using different bioinformatics tools and servers, we predicted multiple B-cell
and T-cell epitopes having potential for the required vaccine design. Phylogenetic analysis
provided insight on ancestral molecular changes and molecular evolutionary relationship of S, E,
and M proteins. Based on the antigenicity and surface accessibility of these proteins, eight
epitopes were selected by various B cell and T cell epitope prediction tools. Molecular docking
was executed to interpret the binding interactions of these epitopes and three potential epitopes
WTAGAAAYY, YVYSRVKNL, and GTITVEELK were selected for their noticeable higher
binding affinity scores -9.1, -7.4, and -7.0 kcal/mol, respectively. Targeted epitopes had 91.09%
population coverage worldwide. In summary, we identified three epitopes having the most
significant properties of designing the peptide-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

Background
History suggests that humanity is always challenged by emerging viruses and viral infections in
terms of livelihood and economic progress in a population. The current situation of ongoing
pandemic of corona virus disease (COVID 19) verily supports that history. The disease came to
recognition by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic on 11th March, 2020 and
has caused a global emergency across 210 countries and territories around the world and 2
international conveyances [1]. As of today, 11th June, 2020 at 18.09 (GMT +6), a confirmed
report of 3,295,032 active infected cases with 2% criticality and 421,363 deaths has been found.
(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). But the disease originated back in December,
2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in the form of cluster of pneumonia like symptoms
which then quickly transcended the border to spread across the globe within a short span of time
[2].
The causative agent behind the infection was first designated as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO)[3]. The novel coronavirus was further
renamed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronovirus-2 or SARS-CoV-2 because of its
genomic similarity of 79.5% and 96% at nucleotide level, respectively with SARS-CoV and bat
coronavirus [4, 5].Through phylogenetic analysis, SARS-CoV-2 has been categorized under the
family Coronaviridae and order Nidoviralae and has shown an origin in bat as a natural host [6,
7]. The SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV of the same genus
Betacoronavirus within the same family in terms of infectivity in humans. The latter two viruses
caused pandemic situations as well in recent years and were the reasons for thousands of death
across the world [8-10]. As for the structural similarity, the SARS-CoV-2 contains a positive
single stranded RNA as its genetic element having a genomic length of around 30 kilobases [11].
The encoded proteins by this genome are structural and non-structural in kind and the major
structural proteins are spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein, envelope (E) protein, and
nucleocapsid (N) protein [12-14]. Especially the exposed parts of these proteins contain domains
necessary for infection into the host cells and account for antigenicity. The similarity between
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 extends to the structure of spike glycoprotein which may be
exploited for a potential vaccine design because the S protein has two major subunits namely S1
and S2 which assist during viral infection into the host cell. S1 subunit contains receptor binding
domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) where RBD binds to the receptor of the host cell
known as angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) [15, 16]. The envelope (E) protein also has
its role in establishing a series of involvement from pathogenesis to viral assembly by not only
interacting with the host cell protein but also maintains a defining connection with all the other
structural proteins (M, S, N proteins) of the virus [17]. Moreover, the exposed portion of M
protein outside the membrane provides us an opportunity to design a suitable epitope-based
subunit vaccine.

Currently, different therapeutic strategies are being utilized by the scientific community to
combat this dangerous spread of COVID-19, most of which are opted to develop novel drugs or
vaccines. Chinese traditional drugs named ShuFengJieDu capsules and LianHua Qing Wen
capsules had been applied to some of the preliminary cases before they were reported to be
effective. But no clinical trials to this date have ever proven them to be safe enough[18]. Some
other drugs such as Remdesivir and Chloroquine had also been reported to be effective against
COVID-19 through in-vitro trials. However, no authentic clinical trial has justified such a claim
so far [18, 19].Besides, SARS-CoV-2 is dispersing too fast across almost all the countries of the
world and is mutating in an unbelievable manner. Due to the high mutation rate in the genome of
SARS-CoV-2 single epitope will not suffice to provide for a successful vaccine; rather, a
multiple epitope based vaccine may do the trick here[20].
At the current stage of the pandemic, it will be highly insensible to develop a vaccine through
classical approach in vitro that involves identification, isolation and culture of pathogenic
viruses. Following this particular process will be too expensive and time consuming which is not
desirable at all given the circumstances. A very sustainable way to overcome such hurdles would
be to design peptide vaccine by genome and proteome analysis of the virus using computational
methods. Since the genome and proteome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has already been done, it
is only rational that we take control measures by making the best out of computation-based
analysis to design therapeutic targets. In this study, we explored the S, E, and M proteins of
SARS-CoV-2 by using different in silico tools and servers to predict B-Cell and T-Cell epitopes
to eventually design an effective epitope-based vaccine. The predicted epitopes were analyzed
further to check their antigenicity and surface accessibility. Epitope-allele interaction was
investigated through molecular docking. A phylogenetic analysis was undertaken to identify
molecular evolutionary relationship of the selected S, E and M proteins. The study was
concluded with the introduction of a properly designed vaccine from the most suitable of
epitopes.

Materials and Methods
Retrieval of Protein Sequences
The FASTA format of S, E, and M protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from various
geographical areas: Australia, China, USA, Finland, India, Sweden, South Korea were retrieved
from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
Then, the BLAST program from NCBI was used to derive the similar sequences against the
proteins.
Phylogenetic tree construction and analysis:

The S, E, and M protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS and common human
coronavirus strains (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) were targeted for this phylogenetic study.
All the sequences of the proteins retrieved from the NCBI BLASTP result were aligned
separately through the ClustalW algorithm by utilizing the MEGA (version 10.0.5) [21].All the
required parameters for the alignment analysis were used as default program in the software. The
aligned sequences were then visualized with the Jalview (version 2.11.0) [22]for the observation
of consensus and conserved sequences.. The phylogenetic trees were built using the neighborjoining tree function and default analysis preferences in MEGA.
Membrane Topology Analysis:
Epitopes of a protein must be in the exposed regions to mount sufficient immune response. The
membrane topology of these proteins was analyzed using TMHMM v2.0 server[23]and was later
cross-referenced with the InterPro server[24, 25]. The outer membrane regions of these proteins
were selected for further analysis.
Antigenicity prediction:
A vaccine candidate must elicit sufficient antigenic response as antigenicity of epitopes play
a crucial role to provoke adequate immune response. VaxiJen v2.0 server[26]calculates
antigenicity depending on physicochemical properties of proteins with the threshold value
0.4 (for viral protein sequence) .
B cell epitope Identification
B cell epitopes presented on the virus surface proteins are recognized by B lymphocytes to
elicit immune response. Based on artificial neural network, ABCpred v2.0 server[27-30]
predicted the linear B cell epitopes. The epitopes were cross-referenced with Immune
Epitope Database (IEDB)[31], which uses amino acid scales and Hidden Markov Models
(HMM) as prediction method. Moreover, Kolaskar and TongaonkarAngenicity, Parker
Hydrophilicity Prediction tools from IEDB were explored to determine the antigenicity and
hydrophilicity properties of these selected epitopes.
T cell epitope Identification
T cell epitopesconsist of a group of amino acids, presented by antigen presenting cell (APC)
in the bound form with major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules to mount T cell mediated
immune response. Prediction of T cell epitopes was performed by using NetCTL tool, which
utilizes MHC binding affinity, proteosomal processing, TAP transport[32-34]. The tool
predicts half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of epitopes based on Artificial
Neural Network (ANN)[35, 36].The lengths for epitopes were set at 9.0 and 15.0 for MHC I
molecule and MHC II molecular, respectively.
Molecular Docking Analysis of HLA and Epitopes:

The three-dimensional structure of targeted T-cell epitopes were modeled by the PEPFOLD3server [37],a peptide structure predicting tool. The best 3D structure generated by this
server was selected as a ligand for docking analysis. Molecular docking was performed by
the virtual screening tool Pyrx[38]through its Autodock vina [39, 40] program in order to
analyze the interactions among our proposed epitopes and different HLA molecules. Protein
Data bank provided most of the pdb files of HLA molecules for docking study whereas
Phyre2 protein prediction server (Protein Homology/analogy Recognition Engine v2.0) [41]
was used to generate the 3D models of some HLA molecules whose pdb structureswere not
available in PDB. Discovery Studio(v4.5) [42]prepared these HLA molecules as
macromolecules
by removing water, non-polar hydrogen and unnecessary
molecules.Pdbfiles were converted into pdbqt files and the default grid box parameters were
maintained with exhaustiveness value 8.The binding interactions of epitope- HLA molecules
were visualized using UCSF Chimera 1.13rc[43].

Population coverage prediction:
Determination of Population coverage for individual is essential as epitopes may exhibit
variety in their binding sites during interacting with different HLA allele .The IEDB
population coverage calculation tool [44]was utilized to determine the percentage of people
expected to respond to a specific number of MHC-restricted epitopes around the world.

Result & Discussion
One of the most prolific ways to reduce the load of viral diseases is to design novel vaccines [4548]. In terms of SARS-CoV-2, continuous research projects are being held to figure out the
biological characteristics, genomics and proteomics and pathophysiology of the virus around the
world [49]. Immunoinformatics tools have always been a medium to develop multi-epitope
based vaccines for some of the dangerous viral diseases such as rhinovirus[50], dengue
virus[51],chikungunya virus[52] etc. Consistent with that idea, this study aimed at providing for
a peptide based vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 using different bioinformatics tools by
exploring structural proteins of virus namely spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein and
envelope (E) protein[53, 54]responsible for virulence mechanism and pathogenic pathways. A
total of 13 sequences of S protein (Figure S4), 13 sequences of M protein (Figure S5), and 6
sequences of E protein (Figure S6) were selected for analysis.
S, E, and M protein sequences from different strains of MERS, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2
(Table S1&S3) and common human coronavirus, (Table S2) were aligned with the phylogenetic
tree construction using the built-in inClustalW algorithm in the MEGA (version 10.0.5).
Phylogenetic trees represented the ancestral molecular changes, evolutionary history and the
molecular evolutionary relationship on account of S, M, and E proteins, respectively. From the

phylogenetic analysis of spike glycoprotein from the different strains of MERS, SARS-CoV
SARS-CoV-2 and common human coronaviruses (Human coronavirus strains: 229E, NL63,
OC43 and HKU1), we noticed that their ancestral and evolutionary relationship has been
comprehensive and found relatable (Figure S1). Analysis also showed that both human
coronavirus OC43, and HKU1 are closely related to MERS virus whereas distantly related to the
SARS and SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, human coronavirus NL63, and 229E are closely
related to each other. Phylogenetic analysis of the membrane proteins (Figure S2 ) of different
strains of MERS, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and envelop proteins (Figure S3 ) from diverse
strains of MERS, SARS-CoV, SARS-Cov-2 along with common human coronaviruses strains
(229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) showed that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are closely related
to MERS virus whereas OC43, and HKU1 strains are closely related, and also comparatively
closer to the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS virus rather than the other closely related
229E and NL63 strains. Unlikely the ancestral relationship in regard of S and M proteins,
analysis showed a different result for E protein that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are closely related
to MERS virus whereas human coronavirus 229E and NL63 are closely related, and also related to
comparatively closer to the SARS-Cov, SARS-Cov-2 and MERS rather than the other closely related
strain human coronavirus OC43 and HKU1.

Viral infection is facilitated by the outer portion of the domain of viral protein which binds with
the receptor proteins of the host cell. So exposed portions of S, E, and M proteins of SARS-CoV2 normally offer a large scope to induce antibody production against itself[55, 56].Therefore, it is
necessary to design a therapeutic target based on those exposed portions of the virus. In order to
do so, Interpro and TMHMM servers were used to predict the outer portions of each of the
protein. The length of exposed regions (Non-cytoplasmic region) ranging from 1-1213, (Figure
1) (1-11, 35-75) and (1-19, 74-78) respectively for S, E, and M proteins were taken for our
assessment. A vaccine candidate must have antigenic features to maximize its reliability to be an
agent of immune response. To ensure the efficacy of the vaccine, antigenicity of the target
sequences must be checked as it is crucial for the design of peptide-based vaccine. VaxiJen 2.0
server was used to predict antigenicity of all the respective proteins. The S protein region had an
antigenic value of 0.4646 whereas values for the region of E, and M protein were 0.7282, and
0.5102, respectively.
Potential B cell epitopes play significant role by providing protection against viral
diseases[57].Therefore, distinctive analysis techniques were utilized in this method for the
prediction of a linear B cell epitope. Primary sequences of S, E, and M protein were checked
through ABCpred and IEDB server to foresee B-cell epitopes. A total of 59, 5, and 19 B-cell
epitopes for S, E, and M were predicted individually by ABCpred. From all anticipated epitopes,
only 4 epitopes; S (2 epitopes), E (1 epitope), and M (1 epitope) presented on the outside of S, E,
and M proteins were chosen (Table 1) with higher antigenicity score.Kolaskar and Tongaonkar
antigenicity estimation tool (Figure2) was utilized to predict this antigenicity, score appeared in
Table1 and TMHMM server was used to check the surface accessibility.

Based on ABCped, among these four identified epitopes of S protein,
'HRSYLTPGDSSSGWTA', and 'CFTNVYADSFVIRGDE' showed most elevated antigenic
score of 0.92, and 0.85, respectively. Moreover, epitope 'HRSYLTPGDSSSGWTA' is positioned
within the NTD region whereas 'CFTNVYADSFVIRGDE' is inside the RBD region. The E
protein epitope 'NVSLVKPSFYVYSRVK' showed 0.8 antigenic score. This epitope is situated at
48 position of E protein. While at 7 position of M protein the 'TITVEELKKLLE' revealed 0.75
antigenic score and selected for M protein (Table 1). According to IEDB, the 'TITVEELKKLLE'
indicated most noteworthy antigenicity of 1.113 followed by the 'CFTNVYADSFVIRGDE',
'TITVEELKKLLE', and 'HRSYLTPGDSSSGWTA' with the antigenicity of 1.048, 1.043, and
0.993, respectively. The ABCpred score and VaxiJen antigencity results revealed the ability of
all predicted peptides to expand barrier reactions within the host during SARS-CoV-2 infection
as an extracellular part of transmembrane-protein. To discover the hydrophilicity of anticipated
B-cell epitopes parker-hydrophilicity strategy was performed (Figure3).With the hydrophilicity
analysis, the 'HRSYLTPGDSSSGWTA'was found to have remarkable hydrophilicity with the
value of 2.95, whereas hydrophilicity values of 'CFTNVYADSFVIRGDE', 'TITVEELKKLLE',
and 'NVSLVKPSFYVYSRVK' were 1.513, 0.492, and 0.45, respectively (Table 1).
B-cell epitope based vaccines have been quite popular for a long time; however, vaccines based
on T-cell epitopes are currently in the trend as the CD8+ T cells produce a long term memory
response in the host against the infected cell [58].That’s why prediction of T-cell epitopes is an
unquestionable requirement for a vaccine to have preventive capacity. Some of the recent studies
on vaccine development against COVID-19 shed light on only the T-cell epitopes whereas in our
study, we have approached both eligible B and T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 for a maximized
yield in our vaccine design project[58].Here, IEDB server was utilized to evaluate the best TCell epitopes from the chosen protein sequences of S, E, and M protein . Moreover, antigenicity
testing and screening of peptides were done with help of VaxiJen 2.0 server. In light of the high
combinatorial score, the 4 best epitopes for MHC Class-I (Table 2) were chosen for additional
investigation. For MHC class I assessment, NetMHCcons 1.1 Server is a consensus approach
that combines the three best NetMHC, NetMHCpan, and PickPocket class strategy to provide the
most accurate predictions. The MHC-I alleles for which the epitopes demonstrated higher
affinity (IC50, 500nM) were chosen (Table 2).
Between MHC class-I anticipated epitopes, a 9 mer epitope, 'KIADYNYKL' that is inside the
RBD region of SARS-CoV-2 showed higher antigenicity score of 1.6639 followed by the
'GTITVEELK', 'YVYSRVKNL' and 'WTAGAAAYY' (within the NTD region of SARS-CoV-2)
with antigenicity score of 1.0976, 0.7020, and 0.5371,respectively. For MHC Class-II, on the
basis of high combinatorial score, the 4best epitopes (Table S4) were chosen for further analysis.
NetMHCII 2.3 server was used to anticipate MHC-II binding prediction with HLA-DR, HLADQ and HLA-DP MHC class II alleles. The MHC-II alleles for which the epitopes demonstrated
higher affinity (IC50, 500nM) were selected (Table S4). The peptide 'GVLTESNKKFLPFQQ'

that is within the RBD region of SARS-CoV-2 was viewed as increasingly antigenic for its
higher antigenicity score 0.8200 followed by the 'YFKIYSKHTPINLVR' (inside the NTD area
of SARS-CoV-2), 'FYVYSRVKNLNSSRV', 'MADSNGTITVEELKK' with antigenicity score of
0.8197, 0.6103, and 0.4367, individually.
Moreover, molecular docking was performed for the analysis of the binding affinity of our
targeted eight epitopes from membrane, spike and enveloped protein with different HLA
molecules. T-cell Epitope sequence with their docking score are showed in the (Table 3).
Among these eight selected T cell epitopes, 'WTAGAAAYY' bound in the binding pocket of
HLA-B*35:01 allele (PDB ID:4PRN) showed the highest binding score of -9.1 kcal/mol
(Figure4& 5).Interaction between the epitope and the binding pocket atoms of HLA molecule
showed in the Figure 6.On the other hand , 'YVYSRVKNL' bound with HLA-A02:03(PDB ID:
3OX8) and 'GTITVEELK' bound with HLA-A*11:01 (PDB ID: 6JOZ) with the binding affinity
of -7.4, and -7 kcal/mol, respectively exhibit good binding interaction of these epitopes with
HLA molecules. Another essential prerequisite in epitope based vaccine design is to determine
population coverage as MHC polymorphism leads to the expression of different forms of HLA
at considerably different rates among different ethnicities[59, 60]. On the basis of binding
interaction of our targeted epitopes with their respective HLA alleles we finalized three epitopes
for vaccine design having the highest binding affinity. Population coverage for these three
epitopes demonstrated the consequences of the host genetic variety on the binding specificity of
these targeted epitopes to class I HLA alleles. Their cumulative population coverage around the
world 91.09% which revealed that these epitopes can cover about 91% (Figure 7) population
from different regions of the world.
Most of the recent studies emphasized on only the spike protein of the virus given its wide range
of conservancy across the viral population. But our work was dedicated to specific epitopes and
domains of all the mentioned proteins (S, M, and E proteins) for an in-silico design of multiepitope vaccine. Vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 shed light on only the T-cell
epitopes in some recent studies whereas in our study, we have approached both eligible B and T
cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 for a maximized yield in our vaccine design project [61]. All the
ideal criteria of a potential epitope had been pulled off by our selected epitopes of S, M, and E
proteins.

Conclusion
Different vaccine development strategies against SARS-CoV-2 are being opted along with
ongoing trials on novel drug design. In our current study, we suggested three epitopes from
conserved regions of spike, membrane and envelope proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as they have
abilities to produce antigenic response. Their potentialities as vaccine candidate assured by their
antigenic properties and strong binding affinity for MHC molecules. This in-silico study requires
