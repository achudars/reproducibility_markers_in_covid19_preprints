ABSTRACT

16

An escalating pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

17

(SARS-CoV-2) is impacting global health. Specific treatment options for diseases caused by

18

SARS-CoV-2 are largely lacking. Herein, we used a pseudotype virus (pv) bearing the

19

SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein to screen a botanical drug library to identify an agent against

20

SARS-CoV-2 entry. All the four hits, including angeloylgomisin O, schisandrin B,

21

procyanidin, and oleanonic acid, were identified for effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S pv

22

entry in the micromolar range. A mechanistic study revealed that these four agents inhibit

23

SARS-CoV-2 S pv entry by blocking S-mediated membrane fusion. Furthermore,

24

angeloylgomisin O, schisandrin B, and oleanonic acid inhibited authentic SARS-CoV-2 with

25

a high selective index (SI). We also showed that all the four hits could also inhibit the entry of

26

pv of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and newly emerged

27

SARS-CoV-2 variants (D614G, K417N/E484K/N501Y/D614G). In drug combination studies

28

performed in cellular antiviral assays, angeloylgomisin O and schisandrin B displayed

29

synergistic effects in combination with remdesivir. These results indicated that

30

angeloylgomisin O, schisandrin B, procyanidin, and oleanonic acid can inhibit SARS-CoV-2

31

and that they are potential therapeutic agents for COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

34

COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2),

35

poses a severe threat to global public health as well as economic and social stability, requiring

36

rapid development of treatment and preventive measures (1).

37

Coronavirus is an enveloped virus with four structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M),

38

envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. SARS-CoV-2 shares a high degree of sequence

39

identity with SARS-CoV that emerged previously and exploits the same human cell receptor,

40

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for infection (2, 3). After the receptor binding

41

domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit of the S protein on the virion binds to the ACE2 receptor on

42

the target cell, the heptapeptide repeat 1 (HR1) and 2 (HR2) domains in the S2 subunit of the

43

S protein interact with each other to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) fusion nucleus. This

44

interaction brings the virus membrane and cell membrane close together for fusion and

45

infection (4, 5).

46

SARS-CoV-2 culture and assays need to be carried out in a biosafety level (BSL)-3

47

laboratory. The vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) reverse genetics system can provide a safe,

48

reliable, and stable platform to study SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein inhibition by antibodies or

49

small molecules with high assay throughput. Researchers have employed related viral systems

50

that afford virus entry studies at BSL-2 and facilitate rapid inhibitor screening using

51

fluorescence or luminescence-based reporters (6).

52

More than a year after its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 continues to cause a fervor with

53

identification of new variants hailing from the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, the

54

United States, and India (7-9). The G614 variant was first detected in early 2020 and contains

55

a D614G substitution in its S protein’s RBD, which appears to increase viral transmissibility

56

(10-12). As other new variants emerged over the past few months, the major focus of research

57

has been on identifying further RBD substitutions and their impact on infection. Three other

58

mutations in RBD, K417T/N, E484K, and N501Y, have been identified that affect host cell

59

interactions and susceptibility to antibody-mediated neutralization (13-15).

60

Natural compounds have been universally used to prevent and cure various illnesses in many

61

countries since ancient times. With the isolation and characterization of the structures of

62

select natural products, these products have become a critical contributor to pharmaceuticals,

63

and several critical pharmaceuticals have been developed that are modeled after natural

64

products (16, 17).

65

This study focuses on screening drugs targeting the entry step of SARS-CoV-2 infection to

66

block the early stages of viral infection and spread. Using SARS-CoV-2 S

67

VSV-based-pseudovirus (SARS-CoV-2 S pv), we identified that angeloylgomisin O,

68

schisandrin B, procyanidin, and oleanonic acid could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry by inhibiting

69

membrane fusion. Our findings may offer new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of

70

COVID-19.

RESULTS

73

Construction of SARS-CoV-2 S pv (ct19)

74

To perform high-throughput screening under BSL-2 conditions, we constructed a

75

SARS-CoV-2 S pv based on a VSV backbone. The cytoplasmic tail of the S glycoproteins

76

SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to that of SARS-CoV and carries signals for their retention in

77

the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Previous studies found that a 19 amino acid deletion in the

78

cytoplasmic tail of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein increased the infectivity of

79

the single-cycle pseudotype virus (18-21).

80

We generated two recombinant plasmids expressing either the wild type (wt) S glycoprotein,

81

pcDNA3.1-SARS-CoV-2 S, or the truncated S glycoprotein missing 19 amino acids from its

82

C-terminus, pcDNA3.1-SARS-CoV-2 S (ct19), which were used to generate SARS-CoV-2 S

83

pv (wt) or the shortened S glycoprotein, SARS-CoV-2 S pv (ct19), respectively.

84

As shown in Fig. 1A, the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) activity of the cells infected with

85

SARS-CoV-2 S pv (ct19) was higher than that of cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 S pv (wt).

86

Next, the VSV copy number was assayed in the different pv harvests, and a higher packaging

87

efficiency was detected in the SARS-CoV-2 S pv (ct19) system than in SARS-CoV-2 S pv

88

(wt) (Fig. 1A), reaching 1.15×109 copies/ml and 2.3×108 copies/ml, respectively.

89

Immunoblots confirmed the expression and accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in

90

SARS-CoV-2 S pv (ct19) (Fig. 1B), enabling us to use SARS-CoV-2 S pv (ct19) for

high-throughput screening (HTS) of potential botanical drug candidates.

92
93

SARS-CoV-2 S pv (ct19) entry inhibitor screening

94

The HTS assay conditions were optimized to a seeding Caco-2 cell density of 2.4×104 cells

95

and SARS-CoV-2 S pv (ct19) infective dose of MOI=5 per well in 96-well plates. Under

96

these optimized conditions, the signal-to-basal (S/B) ratio, coefficient of variation, and Z’

97

factor were 1286.09, 7.35%, and 0.705, respectively, making this assay promising for

98

large-scale inhibitor screening. As shown in Fig. 2A, the HTS assay was performed by

99

screening a library containing 1,037 botanical drugs. Compounds with inhibition of >80% and

100

no apparent cytotoxicity at a concentration of 50 μM were defined as prime candidates.

101

Fifty-eight (5.59%) prime candidates (Fig. 2A and 2B) were selected. These prime candidates

102

were then counter-screened to rule out the inhibition of VSV genome replication and Rluc

103

activity. Four candidates (0.38%), angeloylgomisin O, schisandrin B, procyanidin, and

104

oleanonic acid passed this secondary screen with mild inhibition against VSV (16.85%,

105

33.65%, 21.02%, and 32.41%, respectively) at 50 μM (Fig. 2C).

106
107

Four hits inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S pv (ct19)

108

The dose-dependent inhibition of the four hits was further investigated using Caco-2 cells. As

109

shown in Fig. 3, all the four hits suppressed SARS-CoV-2 S pv (ct19) infection in a

110

dose-dependent manner. Angeloylgomisin O inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S pv (ct19) by 90% at

111

100 μM and had little effect on VSV pv, demonstrating its specific inhibition of SARS-CoV-2

112

entry (Fig. 3A). Meanwhile, the cell viability was >80% when used at an extremely high

113

concentration (400 μM). Schisandrin B inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S pv (ct19) by 90% at 100 μM,

114

whereas the cell viability was approximately 80% at 400 μM (Fig. 3B). Procyanidin at 50 μM

115

and 100 μM inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S pv (ct19) by approximately 80% and 95%, respectively.

116

The cell viability was approximately 80% at 400 μM (Fig. 3C). Oleanolic acid (50 μM)

117

inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S pv (ct19) by approximately 70% (Fig. 3D). While it is relatively

118

toxic to Caco-2 cells with a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of 53.88 μM. To validate the

119

antiviral effects, four hits were purchased from other commercial sources and tested. The

120

antiviral effects were similar to those observed in our primary screening.

121
122

Four hits inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S (ct19)-mediated membrane fusion

123

To explore the antiviral mechanical properties of the four hits, the effects of the four hits on

124

SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion were examined. Recent research has identified

125

that SARS-CoV-2 induces syncytia formation in the lungs of patients with COVID-19 (22). It

126

was reported that cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibited a typical syncytium phenomenon

127

(5). In this assay, fusion activity was conducted by co-transfecting SARS-CoV-2 S (ct19) and

128

green fluorescent protein (GFP) into Vero E6 cells. After 24 h, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2

129

induced cell-cell fusion, resulting in the formation of syncytia (Fig. 4A). 25-hydrocholesterol

130

(25HC) was used as the positive control (23, 24). As shown in Fig. 4A, 25 μM of 25HC

131

blocked syncytia formation. Likewise, all the four hits induced a dose-dependent reduction in

132

syncytium size (Fig. 4B). Angeloylgomisin O blocked syncytia formation at a concentration

133

of 6.25 μM, while procyanidin, oleanonic acid, and schisandrin B required higher

134

concentrations (12.5 μM to 25 μM) to achieve the inhibition (Fig. 4B). These results

135

suggested that angeloylgomisin O, schisandrin B, procyanidin, and oleanonic acid could

136

inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry by inhibiting membrane fusion.

137
138

Four botanical hits inhibited authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection

139

To evaluate the inhibition of four hits on authentic SARS-CoV-2, an immunofluorescence

140

assay (IFA) was carried out using SARS-CoV-2 NP antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, all the four

141

hits inhibited authentic SARS-CoV-2 in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 values of

142

angeloylgomisin O (3.727 μM), schisandrin B (7.337 μM), and oleanonic acid (1.414 μM)

143

were less than 10 μM, While the IC50 value of procyanidin was 32.59 μM. It seemed that

144

angeloylgomisin O, schisandrin B, and oleanonic acid exerted stronger inhibition on the

145

authentic SARS-CoV-2 than on the SARS-CoV-2 S pv (ct19).

146

The selective index (SI, CC50/IC50) was calculated using the authentic SARS-CoV-2

147

inhibition assay. The SI values of angeloylgomisin O and schisandrin were > 61.12 and >

148

27.25, respectively. Suggesting that both drugs are promising potential candidates against

149

COVID-19.

150
151

Effects of the four hits against MERS-CoV-S pv and SARS-CoV-2 S variants pv

152

To verify the inhibitory effects of the four hits against other coronaviruses and the emergence

153

of SARS-CoV-2 variants, we investigated the antiviral effect of the four hits on MERS-CoV

154

S pv and SARS-CoV-2 S pv variants containing S protein mutations. As shown in Fig. 6A, all

155

the four hits suppressed the entry of MERS-CoV S pv into Caco-2 cells in a dose-dependent

156

manner. The IC50 values of angeloylgomisin O, schisandrin B, procyanidin, and oleanonic

157

acid against MERS-CoV S pv were 21.13 μM, 18.99 μM, 13.97 μM, and 18.05 μM,

158

respectively. Indicating that their therapeutic potential against MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV

159

employed the different receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), from the SARS-CoV-2. It

160

could be ruled out that four hits only interfere with ACE2 to block pseudovirus entry (25, 26).

161

A SARS-CoV-2 S pv variant containing the S protein D614G substitution was constructed

162

and used to evaluate its inhibitory effect. As shown in Fig. 6B, all the four hits suppressed the

163

entry of SARS-CoV-2 S pv D614G into Caco-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50

164

values of angeloylgomisin O, schisandrin B, procyanidin, and oleanonic acid at which

165

SARS-CoV-2 S pv D614G was inhibited were 16.35 μM, 26.60 μM, 33.36 μM, and 25.21

166

μM.

167

We introduced three additional amino acid substitutions, K417N, E484K, and N501Y, in the

168

S D614G protein. These mutations have been observed in the South African variant, 501Y.V2,

169

and play an essential role in immune escape (13-15). A substitution was constructed to

170

evaluate the inhibitory effect. The results showed that all the four hits inhibited SARS-CoV-2

171

S pv K417N/E484K/N501Y/D614G in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6C). The IC50 values

172

of angeloylgomisin O, schisandrin B, procyanidin, and oleanonic acid against SARS-CoV-2 S

173

pv K417N/E484K/N501Y/D614G were 23.76 μM, 41.34 μM, 26.62 μM, and 35.18 μM,

174

respectively, indicating that the all the four hits may inhibit new variants such as 501Y.V2.

175

Mutation of K417N/E484K/N501Y on the viral S proteins of 501.V2 variants renders a

176

change in the RBD allowing additional interaction with human ACE2. All the four hits

177

inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S variant with the similar effect. Further confirmed that four hits

178

inhibited membrane fusion rather than interacted with RBD or ACE2 by inhibiting

SARS-CoV-2.

180
181

Combinatory treatments with the drug pairs remdesivir-angeloylgomisin O showed

182

enhanced antiviral activity

183

As all the four hits could inhibit S-mediated membrane fusion, we assessed the efficacy of the

184

combined treatment by using remdesivir, a SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA-dependent RNA

185

polymerase inhibitor (27, 28), and four hits respectively. The degree of interaction was

186

determined according to the bliss independence model using MacSynergy II software to

187

analyze the results (29, 30). Volumes of statistically significant synergy were evaluated, and

188

combination volumes (CV) of > 25 μM2 % were interpreted as evidence of synergy, and > 100

189

μM2 %, as strong synergy (31).

190

Our results showed that strong synergy interactions occurred between remdesivir and

191

angeloylgomisin O. Combination studies between remdesivir and angeloylgomisin O led to

192

the CV of 158.27 μM2 % (Fig. 7A). For combinations of remdesivir-angeloylgomisin O the

193

maximal synergistic effect was seen at concentration of 0.032 to 0.8 μM remdesivir and

194

1.5625 to 6.25 μM angeloylgomisin O. Remdesivir and schisandrin B showed minor amount

195

of synergy CV was 25.3 μM2 % (Fig. 7A and 7C). Two-drug combinations of

196

procyanidin-remdesivir and oleanonic acid-remdesivir had an additive antiviral inhibition

197

profile (Fig. 7D and 7E).

DISCUSSION

200

In this study, we screened a botanical drug library containing 1,037 compounds and identified

201

four hits, including angeloylgomisin O, procyanidin, schisandrin B, and oleanonic acid, which

202

blocked the entry of SARS-CoV-2 S (ct19) pv infection by inhibiting viral membrane fusion.

203

Furthermore, the four hits inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 authentic virus at the micromolar level.

204

The top two compounds angeloylgomisin O and schisandrin B inhibited authentic

205

SARS-CoV-2 at a highly selective index (SI). All the four hits inhibited MERS-CoV S pv,

206

SARS-CoV-2 S D614G pv, and SARS-CoV-2 S pv K417N/E484K/N501Y/D614G infection.

207

Remdesivir-angeloylgomisin O drug combination showed stronger antiviral activities against

208

SARS-CoV-2 than remdesivir monotherapy.

209

The top two hits, angeloylgomisin O and schisandrin B, were derived from Schisandra

210

chinensis. Fruit from this plant and its extracts were used in traditional medicine in East Asia

211

to treat liver disorders such as hepatitis. They also possess a broad spectrum of biological and

212

pharmacological uses, including antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative properties,

213

without toxicity (32). Schisandrin B has been shown to inhibit cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A)

214

activity in rat liver and thus affects the metabolism of many drugs (33, 34). Furthermore,

215

upon rat oral administration of Schisandra chinensis extract, schisandrin B has been reported

216

to accumulate to a maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 4.54 μM (35). This value was

217

similar to the IC50 value for schisandrin B in the present study, suggesting that this compound

218

offers a biologically feasible treatment for SARS-CoV-2.

219

At the cellular level, CD4＋T cells were rapidly activated to produce inflammatory cytokines

220

after SARS-CoV-2 infection, which further induced CD14＋ CD16＋ monocyte activation

221

with high levels of expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6). Thus, reduced IL-6 would potentially

222

reduce immunopathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 (36, 37). Cai et al. demonstrated that
10

223

schisandrin B pretreatment mice at doses of 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg were shown to reduce

224

lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury with lowered the number of inflammatory cells

225

and pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis IL-6 in bronchoalveolar lavage

226

fluid (38). This result suggested that schisandrin B could coordinate cytokine response to

227

reduced host immune response, and schisandrin B might achieved a better therapeutic effect

228

in vivo.

229

Procyanidin is a proanthocyanidin member that belongs to the class of flavonoids, the

230

secondary metabolites of polyphenolic plants and fungi. Proanthocyanidins are also the most

231

abundant polyphenolic compounds in lignin (39). Maroli et al. used molecular docking

232

analyses to demonstrate that procyanidin can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication (40).

233

In this study, we confirmed that procyanidin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in the entry step.

246

The culture supernatants were harvested 24 h later, centrifuged to remove cell debris, and

stored at −80°C. To generate VSVG pseudotype VSV, BHK-21 cells in 6-well plates were

248

infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7-3) encoding T7 RNA polymerase at an

Immunoblotting

268

Equal volumes of virus particles were precipitated with acetone and lysed using RIPA lysis

269

buffer. Lysates were treated with loading buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then

270

transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore). SARS-CoV-2 S

271

was detected using a rabbit anti-S2 subunit mouse monoclonal antibody (GeneTex,

272

GTX632604;1:2000 dilution). Horseraddish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse IgG antibody

(Proteintech, CHI, USA, 1:5000).

274

HTS optimization and assaying of the botanical drug library

275

The appropriate cell density and the dose for SARS-CoV-2 S pv were selected by comparing

276

the signal-to-basal ratio, the coefficients of variation, and Z’ values under different conditions,

277

as previously described. A library of 1,037 botanical compounds was purchased from

278

Weikeqi Biotech (Sichuan, China). The compounds were collected and stored in 10 mM stock

279

solutions in DMSO at -80 °C until use. The first round of HTS was carried out, and Caco-2

280

cells were seeded at a density of 2.4×104 cells per well in 96-well plates. After incubation

281

overnight, cells were treated in duplicate with the compounds (50 μM), and 1 h later, cells

282

were infected with SARS-CoV-2 S pv (ct19) with the MOI=5, and the supernatant was

283

removed 1 h.p.i. Camostat 100 μM and 0.5% DMSO were used as positive and negative

284

controls, respectively. After 24 h, luciferase activity was measured using the Rluc assay

285

system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The primary compounds were then secondarily

286

screened using VSV pv (MOI of 0.5) to rule out VSV genome replication inhibitors and Rluc

287

activity.

The 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was

290

performed to evaluate the effect of the four hits on cell viability. Hits at the indicated

291

concentrations were added to pre-seeded Caco-2 cells in 96-well plates. Twenty-four hours

292

later, the cell viability was measured using the MTT kit.

Membrane fusion assay

294

Vero E6 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-SARS-CoV-2S (ct19) (0.25 μg) and

295

pEGFP-N1 (0.25 μg) by using lipo2000 in 24-well plates. After transfection for 4 h, the

296

medium was replaced with 2% DMEM containing different concentrations of the hits. After

297

24 h, syncytium formation was visualized using an M-shot image system (Micro-shot

Antiviral effect of four hits against SARS-CoV-2

300

Caco-2 cells were seeded at a density of 2.4×104 cells per well in 96-well plates. After

301

overnight incubation, cell monolayers were treated in duplicate with the hits at a final

302

concentration of 1 h and infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.5. After an additional 24

303

h of incubation, the infection was stopped by rinsing each well, and the cells were fixed with

304

4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized using PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15

305

min and blocked with 5% FBS (Gibco), followed by treatment with the primary antibody

306

anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP (GeneTex GTX635678, USA) at a 1:500 dilution overnight at 4°C.

307

After six rinses with PBS, the cells were stained with DyLight 488-labeled antibody against

308

rabbit

309

4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Nine fields per

Drug-drug interactions of remdesivir with hits

313

Caco-2 cells were seeded at a density of 2.4×104 cells per well in 96-well plates. After

314

overnight incubation, different final concentrations of remdesivir were added to each row of

315

the 96-well plate. Simultaneously, different final concentrations of angeloylgomisin O were

316

added to each column of the plate. The cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of

317

0.5. After an additional 24 h of incubation, the infection was stopped by rinsing each well,

318

and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The antiviral activities were determined

319

using the IFA assay. To determine the drug-drug interactions, differential surface plots at the

320

95% confidence level (CI) were generated using MacSynergy II according to the Bliss

321

independence model. The combinatorial effect was determined by subtracting the theoretical

322

additive values from the experimental values (29, 30). The data sets were interpreted using

323

the following scale: volumes of synergy or antagonism > 100 μM 2 %, strong synergy; 50–100

324

μM 2 %, moderate synergy; 25–50 μM 2 %, minor amount of synergy; 0 -25 μM 2 %, additive
