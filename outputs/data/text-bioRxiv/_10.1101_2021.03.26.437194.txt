Abstract

25

The clinical manifestation of the recent pandemic COVID-19, caused by novel SARS-CoV-2,

26

varies from mild to severe respiratory illness. Although environmental, demographicand co-

27

morbidity factors have an impact on the severity of the disease, the contribution of mutations

28

in each of the viral genes towards the degree of severity needs to be elucidated for designing

29

better therapeutic approach against COVID-19. Here, we studied the effect of two

30

substitutions D155Y and S171L, of ORF3a protein, found in COVID-19 patients. Using

31

computational simulations we discovered that the substitutions at 155th and 171st positions

32

changed the amino acids involved in salt bridge formation, hydrogen-bond occupancy,

33

interactome clusters, and the stability of the protein. Protein-protein docking using

34

HADDOCK analysis revealed that out of the two observed substitutions, only the substitution

35

of D155Y, weakened the binding affinity of ORF3a with caveolin-1. The increased

36

fluctuation in the simulated ORF3a-caveolin-1 complex suggested a change in the virulence

37

property of SARS-CoV-2.

38

Importance

39

The binding interaction of viral ORF3a protein to host caveolin-1 is essential for entry and

40

endomembrane trafficking of SARS-CoV-2. The D155Y substitution in SARS-CoV-2

41

ORF3a is located near its caveolin-binding Domain IV and thus the substitution can interfere

42

with the binding affinity of ORF3a to host caveolin-1. Our in silico study report decreased

43

molecular stability of D155Y mutant of ORF3a and increased fluctuation of the simulated

44

D155Y ORF3a-caveolin-1 complex. Thus, we hypothesize that the D155Y substitution could

45

change the virulence property of SARS-CoV-2.

1. Introduction:

54

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative

55

agent of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)[1].Till February 2021, 114.1

56

million cases have been reported worldwide spanning across 215 countries and territories, out

57

of which 11.1 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV2 in India[2].Mortality rate

58

across the world varies drastically from 9.1% (Mexico) to 0.9% (Turkey) [3].Although age,

59

ethnicity and sex contribute to the demographic variation in the viral transmission and its case

60

fatality rate, how mutation in viral genomecan change,in such variation forpathological

61

manifestation needs to be explored.

62

The SARS-CoV-2 genome consists of approximately 30 kilobasesand shares about 82%

63

sequence identity with both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It also shares more than 90%

64

sequence identity for essential enzymes and structural proteins [4].Despite the similarity, only

65

SARS-CoV-2showssevere pathological manifestations in humans, suggesting theexistence of

66

differential molecular interactions between viral proteins and host cell machinery.

67

The SARS-CoV-2 genome broadly consists of 14 open reading frames (ORF), which are

68

generated from nested transcription of subgenomic RNAs.Interestingly, ORF1a and 1b

69

encode for 16 non-structural proteins (nsp) known as replicase/transcriptase complex. The

70

other ORFs code for 4 structural proteins and 8 accessory proteins [1,4].ORF3 is wedged

71

between spike (S) and envelop (E) ORFs and encodes for a membrane-spanning, ion channel

72

protein ORF3a. It is also known as the single largest accessory protein of 275 amino

73

acids[5,6]. Ribosomal profiling has identified two putative overlapping genes, namely

74

ORF3b and ORF3c, at the 3’ end of ORF3 with an alternative reading frame to the canonical

75

ORF3a[7-10], whose functional importance is not well understood.ORF3a can localise at

76

plasma membrane and Golgi complex, and can exist in both glycosylated and non-

77

glycosylated forms[11]. This viral protein has been shown to be highly immunogenic as

78

antisera isolated from SARS-CoV-infected patients can detect ORF3a [10]. Yountet.aland

79

others have shown that ORF3a has been co-evolved with Spike (S) protein, suggesting the

80

possibility of direct or indirect interactions between ORF3a and S protein[10,12,13].Studies

81

in SARS-CoV-infected Caco2 cells show that ORF3a can be efficiently released in detergent-

82

resistant membrane structures and the diacidic motif, ExD, located within the domain VI,

83

plays importantrole in membrane co-localisation[14].ORF3a has multi-functional roles

84

including activating NLRP3 inflammasome and NFkB pathway, upregulating fibrinogen

85

secretion, downregulating IFN Type Iand inducing ER stress and pro-apoptotic activity[5,15-

86

17].Therefore, mutations in this protein warrant further study to understand its role in the

87

virulence and immune evasive potential of the recent SARS-CoV-2.Several mutations have

88

been reported in the ORF3a gene and have been classified in the form of clades and sub-

89

clades.The mutation patterns of ORF3a gene have been characterized as largely non-

90

synonymous(Q57H, H93Y, R126T, L127I, W128L, L129F, W131C, D155Y,S171L, D173Y,

91

G196V, and G251V). G251V and Q57H exhibit severe virulence property[18-

92

21].Interestingly, the 57th position in ORF3a of pangolin SARS-CoV is H. D155Y and S171L

93

mutations were detectedin Indian patients in May 2020[22]. To understand the functional

94

importance of these mutants, their characterization is needed.

95

Our study aims to understand the effect of these two substitutions (D155Y and S171L) in the

96

structural stability of the ORF3a protein and its ability to form complex with caveolin-1.

97

Using computational simulation, protein-protein docking we find that the amino acids

98

involved inthe hydrophobic interactions,hydrogen bond formation,salt bridge formation and

99

residue interaction patterns are different inwild type (WT), i.e., the original Wuhan

100

sequencecompared with the two mutants having D155Y and S171L substitutions.

2. Methods:

103

2.1 Bioinformatic Methods

104

A total of26,656 sequences of ORF3a protein deposited in NCBI database as on Nov 17,

105

2020 were considered for the bioinformatics analysis. The keywords used for the search were

106

“SARS-CoV-2”, “ORF3a protein”, and“complete structure”. These structures were aligned

107

using the BLAST algorithm on the NCBI website. Some of the post-BLAST sequences were

108

larger than 275 due to erroneous performance of the code. But such cases were very low in

109

number. Subsequently, the erroneous sequences were manually cleaned to obtain the final

110

alignments of the complete protein sequences (275 amino acids). The number of samples

111

whose locations were geo-tagged to India was 614. These sequences were then compared to

112

the Wuhan sequence (NCBI Accession No: YP_009724391.1[23]) and the amino acid

113

positions were compared. The positions, where mismatches were observed with respect to the

114

reference Wuhan sequence (WT), were considered as locationsof mutations. Clearly, lesser

115

number of mutations denote a sequence more similar to the WT, whereas more number of

116

mutations denote a more deviant mutant.Overall the sequences found from NCBI database

117

were compared against the WT and the number of mutations for every position of ORF3awas

118

stored. This essentially provides us with the frequency distribution of the mutations found at

119

each position of ORF3a.We have used PROVEAN score to assess whether the effect of a

120

mutation is deleterious or neutral. PROVEAN score of each mutation was determined using

121

PROVEAN web server [24].

122
123

2.2 Preparation of structure of the ORF3a proteins

124

The cryo-EM structure of WT ORF3a protein of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained from PDB (PDB

125

ID: 6XDC[25]).The symmetry information present in the PDB file was used to convert the

126

structure into the functional dimeric form using PDBe PISA server online [26]. The residues

127

on the second monomer have been numbered using “ ’ ” throughout the manuscript.As no

128

homologous structure of the protein was available, we considered the PDB structure of

129

ORF3a, which has residues from 40th to 238th. Weintroduced the necessary mutations

130

(D155Y and S171L) by modelling the residues in Swiss PDB Viewer[27].

131
132

2.3 Molecular dynamics simulation

133

We performed classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation in AMBER20[28]using

134

AMBER ff14sb force field[29]. The missing hydrogen atoms in the protein structure were

135

added by the LEaP module of AMBER20 package. The protein was then subjected to energy

136

minimisation for 2000 steps using steepest descent and conjugate gradient algorithms. We

137

then solvated the energy minimised structures using rectangular water boxes comprising of

138

TIP3P water molecules [30].Particle mesh Ewald was used to calculate the electrostatic

139

interactions at a cut-off distance of 12Å. We performed initial minimisation and equilibration

140

in order to avoid bad contacts. This was followed by equilibration using NVT ensemble at

141

300K for about 500ps. The systems were then equilibrated using NPT ensemble at 1 atm

142

pressure for 1 ns. We considered 2fs as the time step throughout the minimisation-

143

equilibration-production. After the energy values and the density values converged, the

144

systems were subjected to 100ns production runs using NPT ensemble at 300K and 1 atm

145

pressure. The coordinates were saved after intervals of 2ps. We performed the analyses

146

CPPTRAJ module of AMBER[31] and visualizations were performed using VMD [32].The

147

binding energies for the complexes werecalculated using MMGBSA[33]suite of AMBER.

2.4 Graph theory

150

We used graph theory to decipher the composition of interactomes in terms of participating

151

amino acids involved in pairwise interactions. Briefly,the graph structure G(V,E, W) is

152

denoted by three sets. The first one is, the set of residues, denoted as the vertex set (V) of a

153

graph. Each individual residue, here, is considered as an independent entity, formally termed

154

as a vertex or a node. Say, we denote V as {v1, v2, v3, ....,vn}, where vi is the ith residue.

155

Therefore, |V| = n, where n is the number of nodes in the graph, otherwise also known as the

156

order of the graph. The second set is the set of interactions between residues denoted as the

157

edge set (E). The interaction between the ith and the jth residue may be represented as an edge

158

e(vi, vj) and the edge set E may be represented as {e1, e2, e3, ...., em}. Therefore, |E| = m,

159

where m is the number of edges in the graph, otherwise also known as the size of the graph.

160

Please note that the edges have not been considered as directed because, there is no

161

significance of the roles of the interacting residues in these interactions. Weinitially calculate

162

the average energy values (calculated per unit time) over the time of observation for all

163

n

164

use a threshold to remove the average energy values of those interactions. Here, m is the

165

number of interactions with significant average energy values.These average energy values

166

represent the importance of the interactions and may be denoted as the set of edge weights

167

(W). For every edge, there is a corresponding edge weight, therefore it may be concluded that

168

|W| = m.

169

In this work, we are interested in studying the interaction dynamics of the residues. Due to

170

the difference in interaction energies, from observation, we could intuitively understand that a

171

group of residues are more prone to interact among themselves than the other residues. But,

172

to discover underlying densely interacting residue groups or clusters, we apply algorithms

173

that could reveal the clusters accurately. The equivalent problem in residue-residue

174

interaction graphs or networks is known as graph clustering. We have used one of the most

175

popular community detection techniques, Louvain method, to find out the clusters in this

176

residue interaction network[34]. Please note that we have used the terms cluster and

177

community interchangeably. It provides us with a cover C = {c1, c2, c3, ….., ck}, where k is

178

the number of communities and ci is the ith cluster/community. Each vertex in V belongs to

179

exactly one of the clusters. Therefore, union of the vertex sets of all the clusters would lead

180

back to V.

2.5 Modelling the protein-protein interaction complex

183

We used hierarchical approach to predict the structure of the protein in the absence of a

184

suitable template structure for caveolin-1.I-TASSER server was used to generate five initial

185

models[35-37]. One model was selected based on the C-score (confidence score). The model

186

was then evaluated using the SAVES v5.0 server, where Ramachandran plot and ERRAT

187

analyses were performed[38,39]. Model visualizations were done using Chimera[40]. This

188

model was then simulated for 100ns to generate a more stable structure. The average

189

structure was then considered as the initial structure for docking after proper structural

190

evaluation by Ramachandran Plot and ERRAT analyses[38,39]. The two molecules of human

191

caveolin-1 were docked to the WT ORF3a by using HADDOCK[41]. HADDOCK not only

192

considers traditional energetics and shape complementarity, but also incorporates

193

experimental data in terms of restraints to guide the docking of two proteins.The residues of

194

domain IV on ORF3a and the residues Asp82 to Arg101 on human caveolin-1 were defined

195

as active residues in docking based on the cryo-EM structure information[42]. On the basis of

196

the most negative binding energy,we selected a starting structure for the WT ORF3a-

197

caveolin-1 complex. Necessary mutations were introduced in these structures by modelling

198

with the Swiss PDB Viewer. These structures were subjected to all atomic MD simulations.

3.1 Worldwide prevalence of D155Y and S171L substitution of ORF3a

202

ORF3a protein is important for the viral infection, spreading and modulating the host immune

203

system. To understand the role of mutations in the function of this protein, we first checked

204

the prevalence of each mutationsfound in ORF3a. Fig. 1a shows the number of mutant

205

samples at each position of the ORF3a protein in the global and Indian population from a

206

total of 26,656 samples, deposited in NCBI dataset (dated November 17, 2020). From this

207

figure, we observe that mutations occurat 258 positions of the protein for the global

208

population. Whereas, for the Indian population, mutations were found only at 13

209

positions.Mutations at the 57th position were the highest in both the global and the Indian

210

population. For the Indian population, the positions 155th and 171st showed two instances of

211

mutations while the number of instanceswas 23 and 34 respectively in the global population.

for both world and Indian populations are distributed in the entire protein.Table S1 shows a

214

list of the mutation counts we have found at all the positions of the ORF3a protein sequence.

215
216

3.2 Description of the protein systems

217

The SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein can form dimer[43].The monomeric ORF3a has been

218

dividedinto six domains, each having its own functional importance[20]. Fig. 2 shows the

219

locations of D155Y and D155’Y (red spheres) and S171L and S171’L (cyan spheres). The

220

locations of these substitutions between domains IV and V, and in domain VI suggest their

221

possible role in caveolin binding, intracellular protein sorting and intracellular membrane

222

trafficking of ORF3a[20].

223
224

3.3Stability of the two ORF3a variants, D155Y and S171L

225

The cryo-EM structure of WT ORF3a protein (residues 40 to 238) was downloaded from the

226

Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6XDC) and processed as discussed in the methodology section.

227

The substitutions D155Y and S171L on each monomer were modelled on the WT structure

228

separately using SwissPDBViewer[27]. Each of these structures was simulated in triplicate

229

till 200ns. Fig. 3 shows thetime evolution of the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the

230

simulated structure with respect to the starting frame of simulation. Note that WT and both

231

mutants have shown reasonable stability. WT and D155Y (black and red profiles in Fig. 3)

232

showed lesser RMSD (the final RMSD being 2.25Å) and lesser fluctuation, whereas the

233

S171L (green profile in Fig. 3) variant showed higher RMSD (the final RMSD being

234

2.75Å).The overall fluctuation in RMSD was also greater in S171L compared to the WT and

235

D155Y. This indicates that S171L substitution causes more deviation and may interfere with

236

its membrane localisation.However, the final RMSD values attained by the WT and the two

237

mutants were comparable, indicating a similar final simulated structure.So it can be

238

concluded that the substitutions at D155Y and S171L do not cause a major conformational

239

change of ORF3a from the WT.

240

3.4 Differential behaviour of the constituent residues

241

While RMSDs are a measure of the overall stability of the biological systems under

242

consideration, the B-factor values give an idea on the flexibility of the individual residues.

243

The B-factor values were measured to determine the average flexibility of the protein

244

residues around their mean position across all trajectories (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 shows thatthe

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.26.437194; this version posted March 26, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

245

residues in the WT ORF3a protein exhibit the least deviation from their mean position,

246

whereas the residues in both mutants show moreflexibility. Interestingly,in the D155Y

247

variant, the 155th residue showed higher flexibility compared to the WT(14.52 Å2 for WT and

248

61.7 Å2for D155Yand16.95 Å2 for WT and 55.3 Å2for the D155Yat positions 155 and 155’

249

respectively). Similarly, for the S171L variant, the flexibility of the 171st residue in the

250

mutant was higher than the WT or D155Y(13.69 Å2 for WT and64.94 Å2and 26.59 Å2 for

251

WT and 124.48 Å2for S171Lat positions 171 and 171’respectively). The terminal residues are

252

exposed to solvent and are more flexible, resulting in their high B-factor values as seen in

253

Fig. 4 (as marked). Several other residues which are located both near the positions of

254

mutations as well as distallyalso showed greater flexibility. We thus observe an effect of the

255

mutation on the overall dynamics of the protein at distant locations. Thus, these mutations

256

may have allostericeffects on the domain specific function of the ORF3a protein.

257
258

3.5 Differential contribution of stabilizing residues in the ORF3a proteins

259

The WT and the mutant ORF3a proteinswere analysed to understand the role of individual

260

amino acids, hydrogen bond occupancies and salt bridges in their structural stability. The free

261

energies of the three variants(WT and the two mutants) were calculated by using the

262

MMGBSA module of Amber20 and are tabulated in Table 1, which shows the differences in

263

stability among them.The S171L mutant with a free energy of -5376.51 (± 19.34)

264

kcal/molwas the most stable, followed by WT (-5356.85± 12.95kcal/mol) and D155Y mutant

265

(-5266.41± 12.56kcal/mol).This indicates that the mutants D155Y and S171L can also exist

266

independently just like the WT ORF3a protein. To understand the contributing factors for

267

these variations in stabilizing energy, we looked at the contributions of eachamino acidto the

268

overall free energy and tabulated the top contributors for each variantin Table 2. While we

269

observe that the group of residues contributing to the overall stability remains almost

270

unchanged among the variants, their ranking differs. For instance, in WT, Arg68 plays the

271

most important role, whereas in case of the mutant systems, it is Arg126’ that has the most

272

contribution. However, Arg68 features as the second most contributory residue in D155Y

273

mutant, whereas in the S171L mutant, it has the fourth position. In this mutant, the Arg126

274

plays the second most important role, following its corresponding residue on the second

275

monomer.

276

We also checked the hydrogen bond interactions in WT and the two mutant ORF3a proteins,

277

and found that thetotal number of hydrogen bonds remain same (average number is 95, Fig.

278

S1), inall the three variants.In contrast, the individual residuesthat have the most hydrogen

279

bond occupancy vary among the ORF3a proteins. We found that the top three residue pairs

280

involved in forming hydrogen bonds with the maximum occupancy are Tyr156’-Lys192’,

281

Arg134-Asp155 and Ser205’-Asn144’. In D155Y, the top three residue pairs forming the

282

hydrogen bonds with maximum occupancy are Tyr212’-Thr164, Ser205’-Asn144’ and

283

Ser205-Asn144. In the mutant S171L, the top three residue pairs forming hydrogen bonds

284

with maximum occupancy areLeu203-Asp210, Leu203’-Asp210’ and Thr89-Leu85’. A

285

detailed list is given in Table S2.We also calculated the salt bridge interactions for the WT

286

and the two mutant proteins and tabulated the list of salt bridges in Table S3, which shows

287

that D155Yforms lesser number (24) of salt bridges compared to the WT and the S171L (31

288

each). Interestingly, mutation at position 155, but not at 171, breaks the salt bridge formation

289

between Asp155-Arg134. This residue pair is formed at the end of the alpha helix and the

290

beginning of a beta sheet in the proximity of domains III and IV of ORF3a.Thus this loss of

291

salt bridge interaction in D155Y is significant and may play a role in the binding affinity of

292

the interacting partner of the ORF3a protein at this region.

3.6 Changes in interactome interactions – Agraph theoretic perspective

295

The variation in hydrogen base pairing and salt bridges prompted us to check the interactome

296

interactions in ORF3a variants. We represented the interactions between the interactomes in

297

terms of a network. The pairwise hydrophobic interaction energies of the residues in theWT

298

and the two mutants of ORF3a were calculated using MMGBSA suite of Amber20. These

299

hydrophobic interaction energies were considered for building a residue-residue interaction

300

network for the WT and the two mutant proteins. Here, we have used graph data structures

301

and relevant algorithms, to model the interactionsamong the residues.

302

The spatial orientation of the protein, adjacency of the residues and interactions among them

303

play a role in finding the clusters or communities of interacting residues. In the visualization

304

of the clusters, as seen in Fig. 5a, we see the whole interaction network and an overview of

305

the clusters. In Fig. 5b, we zoom on one part of the graph and provide a closer view of the

306

interactions. The node colours denote its affiliation to a certain cluster. The edge colours are

307

determined by the colours of the nodes it is incident upon. The edge thickness denotes the

308

strength of the interactions between the residues, i.e., the weight of the edge. In Fig. 5c, one

309

residue has been selected to show the nodes adjacent to it (also known as its neighbourhood).

310

Fig. 6 shows these clusters as can be seen in the actual protein. We observe that the

311

membership of the residues in the clusters in each protein has shown substantial variation. A

312

list of the clusters and their constituent residues has been provided for the WT and the two

313

mutants (D155Y and S171L) in Table S4. Fig. 6 and Table S5 indicate that the residues of the

314

functional domains have rearranged in different interacting clusters in WT and the two

315

mutants. Domain III being the largest in size has split into the most number of clusters.

316

However, the clusters are different in terms of the constituent residues for WT and the two

317

mutants. Thus, we may conclude that the mutations have changed the interaction patterns of

318

the interactomes present in the protein. Due to changes in residue interactions, the clusters

319

have changed from WT to the other mutants. But it should be noted that the cluster

320

membership for the nodes in the regions of mutations do not change. This indicates that the

321

mutations may have distal effects too, which can be explored further for better understanding

322

of the protein function.

324

3.7 Formation of complex with partner protein caveolin-1

325

We are interested to check if the substitution can change the binding interaction of ORF3a

326

protein with host caveolin-1.Issaet.al.[20]have suggested that domain IV of ORF3a binds to

327

caveolin-1 protein, which is required forviral uptake and regulation[44,45].We modelled

328

caveolin-1 using a hierarchical approach to predict the structure of the protein. Five initial

329

models were then generated using the I-TASSER server. Out of these, one model was

330

selected based on the C-score (confidence score). This model was then evaluated using the

331

SAVES v5.0 server, where Ramachandran plot analysis and ERRAT analysis were

332

performed as shown in Fig. 7a-b. Ramachandran plot showed that 96.9% of the residues of

333

caveolin-1 were within the favoured and allowed regions, while 3.1% of the residues were in

334

the disallowed regions. On the other hand, ERRAT analysis had an overall quality factor of

335

89.412.

336

The modelled structure of human caveolin-1 was simulated for 100ns to generate a well

337

equilibrated and stable structure. The stability of the simulation, as evident from the time

338

evolution of the RMSD of the protein from its starting structure, has been shown in Fig. S2a.

339

The average structure from this simulation (Fig. S2b) was considered as the starting structure

340

of the ORF3a-caveolin-1 complexesafter proper structural evaluation (Fig. 7c-d).

341

Ramachandran plot of the average simulated and stable structure showed that 98.1% of the

342

residues were within the ranges of favourable and allowed regions, and only 1.9% of the

343

residues were in the disallowed regions. ERRAT plot too showed an improvement with the

344

overall quality factor increased to 94.304%.Thus, both Ramachandran plot and ERRAT

345

analysis (Fig. 7c-d) indicated that thecaveolin-1 model was of acceptable quality, and could

346

be used as the starting structure for docking.

347

We carried outour protein-protein docking using the HADDOCK webserver[41,46]. We

348

consider binding domains on ORF3a and caveolin-1 as the interacting residues [42]. Our

349

analysis generated twelve probable structures from three clusters as shown in Fig. S3. In each

350

of these structures, we had two molecules of the human caveolin-1 interacting with the

351

dimeric form of ORF3a protein. The top structure from the topmost cluster (left-most

352

structure in first row of Fig. S3), having a HADDOCK score of -155.3 (±22.2) was

353

considered as our starting structure. This structure showed a symmetrical nature. The buried

354

surface area of this complex was found to be 3031.4 (± 181) Å2, signifying a strong complex.

355

The necessary mutations were introduced into the protein-protein complex by Swiss

356

PDBViewer.

357

The starting structures for WT and the two mutants were simulated for 100ns. The stability

358

for these structures was assessed by plotting the time evolution of their RMSD values with

359

respect to the starting frame of simulation (as shown in Fig. 8). We observe that the WT and

360

the S171L are stable having an average RMSD value around ~-9Å. Although the absolute

361

value is high, yet the protein complexes reached stability and showed a plateau in the RMSD

362

plot from ~40ns, again indicating a stable complex. However, for the D155Y system, the

363

protein complex showed a lot more fluctuation and deviation from the starting structure. This

364

indicates a not-so-stable complex structure, which is further supported by the lower

365

PROVEAN score of D155Y (Table S6). Since the mutation is present in the vicinity of the

366

caveolin binding domain in ORF3a, it can be said that the presence of the mutation leads to

367

an unstable protein-protein complex formation. Thus, the D155Y substitution interfereswith

368

the caveolin binding activity of ORF3a protein. We also calculated the free

369

energy,corresponding to the binding of caveolin-1 to the ORF3a protein, in these three

370

protein complex systems. The values for WT, D155Y and S171L were -37.6385 (±8.3248)

371

kcal/mol, -11.5504 (±2.9333) kcal/moland -31.9254 (± 5.0812) kcal/mol, respectively. From

372

these values, it is evident that the binding affinity of caveolin-1 is considerably less in D155Y

373

mutant compared to WT and S171L. This is in corroboration with the unstable protein-

374

protein complex in the D155Y system. The change in hydrogen bonding, salt bridge

375

patternand hydrophobic interaction pattern associated with D155Y substitution may have

376

contributed to the weakened interaction betweenD155YORF3a and caveolin-1.

379

In this study, we have established that D155Y substitution changes the intramolecular

380

hydrogen bonding, salt bridge formation, and disrupts the interaction between ORF3a and

381

caveolin-1.

382

Several other mutations are present in ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2. Wuet. al. have shown that the

383

incidence of mutation at position 57 is high, compared to the other positions[47]. In order to

384

consider the effect of mutation at the 57th position in D155Y and S171L, we simulated Q57H,

385

Q57H-D155Y and Q57H-S171L variants of ORF3a, for 200ns. Their structural stabilities

386

were calculated with MMGBSA and have been tabulated in Table 3. We noted that the

387

structural stabilities for Q57H and the Q57H-S171L variants were comparable to WT,

388

D155Y and S171L (values listed in Table 1).The Q57H-D155Y variant had considerably

389

lesser stability.Previously Hassan et.al. reported the presence of H at the 57th position in

390

ORF3a protein of pangolin CoV[22].Thus, we may hypothesize that the presence of H may

391

provide natural stability of ORF3a.We checked the structural stability of W131C, W131R,

392

G172C and G172V, which were found in Indian patients. We simulated the variants W131C,

393

W131R, G172C and G172V for 200ns. These four variants were stable and showed an

394

average RMSD value of 2.5Å with respect to the starting structure as shown in Fig. S4. The

395

overall binding free energies for the four variants were also calculated, and we noted that the

396

stabilities for the systems W131C, G172C and G172V were similar to that of the WT ORF3a

397

protein as listed in Table 1. The variant W131R, was more stable than WT ORF3a. This

398

indicates that these four mutants are very stable and can have independent existence. Further

399

study is needed to check the effects of these substitutions both in silico and in vitro. On the

400

contrary, mutation at 155th position (D155Y) reduced the binding affinity of ORF3a to

401

caveolin. The disrupted interaction can be indicative of improved viral fitness, wherein, the

402

virion particles can continue to build the host intracellular viral load without inducing host

403

cell apoptosis or promoting their egress thus lengthening the asymptomatic phase of the

404

infection. Contrariwise, the ORF3a-caveolin-1 affinity change can also affect the virion

405

internalisation into host cells, endomembrane sorting and assembly of the viral components.

406

Direct Coupling Analysis revealed eight genes involved in epistatic interactions at several

407

polymorphic loci. The locusof ORF3a is involved in three out of eight potentially significant

408

epistatic links with, namely, nsp2, nsp6 and nsp12. These intragenetic interactions open up

409

the possibility of potential evolutionary links of the above described substitutions at D155Y

410

and S171L with other positively selected loci in viral genes, which is reportedly subject to

411

demographic variations[48].Moreover, the Neanderthal-derived COVID-19 risk haplotype is

412

altogether positively selected in some populations and has 30% allele frequency thus

413

introducing an evolutionary landscape to the current COVID-19 pandemic[49].

414

Our simulation studies and further analyses ofORF3a protein have shown that the presence of

415

mutations affects the structural stability of the ORF3a protein. The residues involved in

416

forming several stabilising interactions in these proteins also change with the presence of

417

mutations. Although the overall stability of the protein structures in the WT and the two

418

variants are not much different,these mutations may affect the binding affinity of ORF3a with

419

its partner proteins. For instance, in this study we have shown the presence of mutation

420

drastically reduces the binding affinity of ORF3a with caveolin-1.SARS-CoV-2 enters the

421

host cell by both membrane fusion and by clathrin/caveolin-mediated endocytosis after

422

binding to the ACE2 cell-surface receptors in the upper respiratory tract and alveolar

423

epithelial cells[50-52].Caveolin/cholesterol mediated endocytosis has been previously

424

implicated in SARS-CoV through an in silico study wherein several caveolin-1 binding

425

domains (CBD) were found in SARS-CoV proteins and internalisation of virion was

426

proposed to be facilitated in a caveolin-1 and lipid raft-dependent manner. However, the role

427

of caveolin-1 was not limited to viral entry.Rather, it was associated with all stages of viral

428

life cycle starting from virus binding to surface receptors, fusion and endomembrane

429

trafficking of virus in caveosomes, sorting of viral components to endomembrane surfaces,

430

replication, assembly and to subsequent egress. The host-derived lipid bilayer surrounding

431

the enveloped viral nucleocapsid contains caveolin-1 incorporated during viral fission from

432

the host membrane [53]. Thus, binding interactions of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a WT and

433

mutational variants with caveolin-1 provides a putative alternative route for viral

434

pathogenesis in COVID-19. Change in interaction of D155Y ORF3a with caveolin-1 may

435

provide an alternative route to exhibit SARS-CoV-2 virulence properties in COVID-19

436

patients.

437

Cryo-EM structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 proteins shows that ORF3a can exist in dimeric

438

and tetrameric complex arrangements with six functional domains (Domain I to VI) of each

439

protomer. The protein comprises of 3 helices, spanning the transmembrane domain (Domains

440

II and III) and a cytosolic domain with multiple beta-strands (Domain IV, V, VI) [20,54].

441

Each domain of SARS-CoV ORF3a interacts with different host proteins and modulateshost

442

signalling pathways. Domain II has binding sites for TRAF3 and ASC, and interacts to

443

activate NLRP3 inflammasome[5].Domain III has a conserved Cysteine residue at 133rd

444

positionknown to stabilize ORF3a homodimer and homotetramers for its ion channel

445

activity[43,54].Cytosolic domain IV has a conserved motif YDANYFVCW from amino acids

446

141-149 that binds with host caveolin-1[55].Finally, domains V and VI, comprising of the

447

YXXφ and diacidicExD motifs respectively, are essential for intracellular viral protein

448

sorting, trafficking and localization of ORF3a to the host membrane followed by its release

449

into culture medium[14]. The various other host proteins as binding partners to ORF3a

450

protein include components of the anti-inflammatory pathway HMOX1, innate immune

451

signalling pathway, TRIM59, glycosylation pathway (ALG5) and nucleus-inner-membrane

452

proteins (SUN2 and ARL6IP6)[56]. ORF3a also regulates Caspase 8-mediated extrinsic

453

apoptotic pathway for its pro-apoptotic activity in HEK293T cells[17]. Thus, mutations in the

454

binding regions or in its close proximity may interfere with the host protein-viral ORF3a

455

interaction, which needs to be further validated. SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a was among the other

456

candidate proteins that has been found to elicit significant CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response

457

and it has been suggested that an optimal vaccine should be inclusive of class I epitopes

458

derived from M, nsp6 and ORF3a[57-59].Our in silico study provides support to carry out in

459

vivo and in vitro studies for evaluating viral pathogenesis with mutant SARS-CoV-2.
