ABSTRACT
SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolates encoding a D614G mutation in the viral
spike (S) protein predominate over time in locales where it is found, implying that
this change enhances viral transmission. We therefore compared the functional
properties of the S proteins with aspartic acid (SD614) and glycine (SG614) at residue
614. We observed that retroviruses pseudotyped with SG614 infected ACE2expressing cells markedly more efficiently than those with SD614. This greater
infectivity was correlated with less S1 shedding and greater incorporation of the S
protein into the pseudovirion. Similar results were obtained using the virus-like
particles produced with SARS-CoV-2 M, N, E, and S proteins. However, SG614 did
not bind ACE2 more efficiently than SD614, and the pseudoviruses containing these S
proteins were neutralized with comparable efficiencies by convalescent plasma.
These results show SG614 is more stable than SD614, consistent with epidemiological
data suggesting that viruses with SG614 transmit more efficiently.

Until late 2019, only six coronaviruses were known to infect humans: HCoV-229E,
HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), HCoV-NL63, CoV-HKU1, and MERS-CoV.
A seventh, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in the winter of 2019 from Wuhan, China. SARSCoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV-1, a virus that appeared from Guangdong
province, China in late 2002.
The coronavirus spike (S) protein mediates receptor binding and fusion of the viral and
cellular membrane. The S protein extends from the viral membrane and is uniformly
arranged as trimers on the virion surface to give the appearance of a crown (corona in

Latin). The coronavirus S protein is divided into two domains: S1 and S2. The S1
domain mediates receptor binding, and the S2 mediates downstream membrane fusion1,2.
The receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2

(ACE2)3-7, a

metalloprotease that also serves as the receptor for SARS-CoV-18. A small,
independently folded subdomain of S1, described as the receptor-binding domain (RBD),
directly binds ACE2 when the virus engages a target cell9-12. The S1/S2 junction of
SARS-CoV-2 is processed by a furin-like proprotein convertase in the virus producer
cell. In contrast, the S1/S2 junction of SARS-CoV-1 is processed by TMPRSS2 at the
cell surface or by lysosomal cathepsins in the target cells13-18. Both S proteins are further
processed in the target cell within the S2 domain at the S2’ site, an event that is also
required for productive infection19,20.
Recent analyses of the fine-scale sequence variation of SARS-CoV-2 isolates identified
several genomic regions of increased genetic variation21-30. One of these variations
encodes a S-protein mutation, D614G, in the carboxy(C)-terminal region of the S1
domain21-23,26,30. This region of the S1 domain directly associates with S2 (Fig. 1a). This
mutation with glycine at the residue 614 (G614) was previously detected to increase with
an alarming speed21,22. Our own analysis of the S-protein sequences available from the
GenBank showed a similar result: The G614 genotype was not detected in February
(among 33 sequences) and observed at low frequency in March (26%), but increased
rapidly by April (65%) and May (70%) (Fig. 1b), indicating a transmission advantage
over viruses with D614. Korber et al. noted that this change also correlated with
increased viral loads in COVID-19 patients22, but because this change is also associated

with the mutations in viral nsp3 and RdRp proteins, the role of the S-protein in these
observations remained undefined.
To determine if the D614G mutation alters the properties of the S-protein in a way that
could impact transmission or replication, we assessed its role in viral entry. Maloney
murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based pseudoviruses (PVs), expressing green fluorescent
protein (GFP) and pseudotyped with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) carrying the
D614 or G614 genotype (SD614 and SG614, respectively) were produced from transfected
HEK293T cells as previously described31. An SD614 variant, in which the furin-cleavage
motif between the S1 and S2 domains is ablated (SFKO), was also included for
comparison. HEK293T cells transduced to express human ACE2 (hACE2-293T) or those
transduced with vector alone (Mock-293T) were infected with the same particle numbers
of the PVs pseudotyped with the SD614, SG614, or SFKO (PVD614, PVG614, or PVFKO,
respectively), and infection level was assessed one day later. We observed PVG614
infected hACE2-293T cells with approximately 9-fold higher efficiency than did PVD614
(Fig. 1c,d). This enhanced infectivity of PVG614 is not an artifact of PV titer
normalization, as their titers are very similar (Extended Data Fig. 1).
We next investigated the mechanism with which SG614 increased virus infectivity.
Because S1 residue 614 is proximal to the S2 domain, we first compared the ratio
between the S1 and S2 domains in the virion that might indicate altered release or
shedding of the S1 domain after cleavage at the S1/S2 junction. To do so, we used Sprotein constructs bearing Flag tags at both their amino (N)- and C-termini. PVs
pseudotyped with these double-Flag tagged forms of SD614, SG614, and SFKO were partially
purified and concentrated by pelleting through a 20% sucrose layer32 and evaluated for

their infectivity. The titers of PVs were similar among PVG614, PVD614, and PVFKO before
and after purification (Fig. 2a). In addition, modification by Flag-tags or pelleting of PVs
through a sucrose layer did not alter the relative infectivity between PVG614 and PVD614
(Fig. 2b). We then determined their S1:S2 ratio by western blotting using the anti-Flag
M2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2c, the S1:S2 ratio is markedly greater in PVG614
compared to PVD614, indicating that glycine at residue 614 of SG614 stabilizes the
interaction between the S1 and S2 domains, limiting S1 shedding. In addition, the total
amount of the S protein in PVG614 is also much higher than that in PVD614, as indicated by
a denser S2 band, even though the same number of pseudovirions was analyzed, as
determined by quantitative PCR. To independently confirm that similar number of virions
was analyzed, the lower part of the same membrane was blotted with an anti-p30 MLV
gag antibody (Fig. 2c). Similar densities of p30 bands were observed from all PVs,
indicating that differences in S-protein incorporation observed with PVG614 and PVD614
were due to the mutation of residue 614, not by different amount of PVs analyzed. A
similar experiment performed with independently produced PVs yielded a nearly
identical result (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Densitometric analysis shows there is 4.7 times
more S1+S2 band in PVG614 compared to PVD614 (Fig. 2d). To more accurately estimate
the S1:S2 ratio, we next compared different amount of the same samples so that S2-band
intensity in PVG614 and PVD614 was comparable (Fig. 2e). Averages of several
quantification show that the S1:S2 ratio of PVG614 is 3.5 times higher than that of PVD614
(Fig. 2f). The M2 antibody used in this experiment binds the Flag tag located at both the
N- and C-termini of a protein, but it binds N-terminal Flag tag more efficiently33.
Therefore, we directly visualized virion S-protein bands by silver staining (Extended

Data Fig. 2b). Although the S2 bands are masked by a same-sized MLV protein, S1
bands are well separated. Again, the intensity of the S1 band of PVG614 is much stronger
than that of PVD614, while p30 bands are comparable, a result consistent with those
observed using the anti-Flag M2 antibody.
We next confirmed these findings using virus-like particles (VLPs) composed only of the
native SARS-CoV-2 proteins, the nucleoprotein (N), membrane protein (M), envelope
protein (E), and S protein34. VLPs were partially purified and analyzed in the same way
as MLV PVs. The S protein bands were detected with the anti-Flag M2 antibody, and the
N protein with pooled convalescent plasma derived from COVID-19 patients. The S1:S2
ratio and total S protein on the virion was again much higher in the VLPs carrying SG614
(VLPG614) compared to those carrying SD614 (VLPD614) (Fig. 3a). The S1:S2 ratio is 3.4
fold higher and the total S protein is nearly five fold enriched in VLPG614 compared to
VLPD614 (Fig. 3b,c). Thus, the D614G mutation enhances virus infection through two
related mechanisms: It reduces S1 shedding and increases total S protein incorporated
into the virion.
It has previously been speculated that D614G mutation promotes an open configuration
of the S protein that is more favorable to ACE2 association5,22,23,35. To explore this
possibility, we investigated whether ACE2 binding by SG614 was more efficient than that
by SD614. HEK293T cells transfected to express each S protein were assessed for their
binding of hACE2 immunoadhesin, using hACE2-NN-Ig, whose enzymatic activity was
abolished by mutation31. hACE2-NN-Ig bound SARS-CoV-1 RBD with an equivalent
affinity as hACE2-Ig. These S proteins are fused to a C-terminal, but not an N-terminal
Flag tag, thus allowing for the measurement of total S protein expression in

comparable, hACE2-NN-Ig binding to the cells expressing SG614 was substantially higher
than its binding to cells expressing SD614 (Fig. 4a).
explanations.

This observation has several

First, G614 could increase hACE2 association by promoting greater

exposure of the RBD, or second, this mutation could increase the number of binding sites
by limiting S1-domain shedding. To differentiate these possibilities, we appended the
Myc-tag to the N-terminus of the S-protein that is Flag tagged at its C-terminus and
repeated the study, this time detecting the S1 domain with an anti-Myc antibody. As
shown in Fig. 4b, the ratio of Myc-tag to Flag-tag is higher in cells expressing SG614 than
in cells expressing SD614. However, the Myc-tag/Flag-tag ratio is similar to the hACE2NN-Ig/Flag-tag ratio, indicating that increased hACE2 binding to the SG614-expressing
cells did not result from increased affinity of SG614 spikes to hACE2 or greater access to
the RBD. Instead, these data show there is more S1 domain in the SG614-expressing cells,
a result again consistent with the observation that the D614G mutation reduces S1
shedding. We then assessed whether differential amount of the S protein could influence
neutralization sensitivity of the virus. Fig. 4c shows that PVD614 and PVG614 are similarly
susceptible to neutralizing antisera, indicating that antibody-mediated control of viruses
carrying SD614 and SG614 would be similar.
It has also been speculated that the D614G mutation would promote, not limit, shedding
of the S1 domain, based on the hypothetical loss of a hydrogen bond between D614 in S1
and T859 in S222. An alternative explanation, more consistent with the data presented
here, is that Q613 forms a hydrogen bond with T859, and the greater backbone flexibility
provided by introduction of glycine at an adjacent position 614 enables a more favorable

orientation of Q613. It is also possible that D614 can form an intra-domain salt bridge
with R646, promoting a local S1 conformation unfavorable to its association with S2. In
this model, replacing aspartic acid with glycine at the position 614 would prevent
sampling of this unfavorable configuration. The instability of SD614 may also account for
the observed lower level of incorporation of the functional S protein into PVs and VLPs.
Specifically, the S-protein trimers with the exposed S2 domains, as a result of S1
shedding, could destabilize the trans-Golgi network membrane, the site of processing of
the S1/S2 boundary, and such disruption may impede S-protein incorporation into the
virion. In case of VLPs, this disruption would presumably further interfere with
appropriate M- and N-protein associations by altering the conformation and orientation of
the S-protein membrane-proximal regions. Alternatively, these S-protein trimers with the
exposed S2 domains may serve as poor substrates for downstream post-translational
modifications including palmitoylation, and those lacking proper modifications might be
unsuitable for virion incorporation.
An interesting question is why viruses carrying the more stable SG614 appear to be more
transmissible without resulting in a major observable difference in disease severity22,27. It
is possible that higher levels of functional S protein observed with SG614 increase the
chance of host-to-host transmission, but that other factors limit the rate and efficiency of
intra-host replication. Alternatively, the loss of virion-associated S proteins observed with
SD614 may be compensated by greater fusion efficiency with the destabilized S protein
when the next target cell is adjacent in a host tissue. It is also possible that our ability to
detect sequence changes at this early stage of the pandemic is simply greater than our
ability to detect modest differences in pathogenesis. The strong phenotypic difference we

observe here between D614 and G614 suggests that more study on the impact of the
D614G mutation on the course of disease is warranted.
Finally, our data raise interesting questions about the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 as it
moved presumably from horseshoe bats to humans. At some point in this process, the
virus acquired a furin-cleavage site, allowing its S1/S2 boundary to be cleaved in virusproducing cells. In contrast, the S1/S2 boundary of SARS-CoV-1, and indeed all SARSlike viruses isolated from bats, lack this polybasic site and are cleaved by TMPRSS2 or
endosomal cathepsins in the target cells13-20. Thus the greater stability we observe with
SG614 would not be relevant to viruses lacking this site, but it appears to be strongly
favored when a furin-cleavage site is present. Therefore, the D614G mutation may have
emerged to compensate for this newly acquired furin site.
In summary, we show that an S protein mutation that results in more transmissible
SARS-CoV-2 also limits shedding of the S1 domain and increases S-protein
incorporation into the virion. Further studies will be necessary to determine the impact of
this change on the nature and severity of COVID-19.

Methods
SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequences analysis. To track D614G variation among SARSCoV-2 isolates, S protein sequences were downloaded from GenBank and separated by
the month. Genotype frequency at residue 614 was calculated using R (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing) with the Biostrings package. Logo plots of D614G variation were
generated by WebLogo after sequence alignment. Total number of sequences analyzed
for each month is indicated in the Fig. 1 legend.

MLV PV production, quantification, and infection. MLV PVs were produced by
transfecting HEK293T cells at ~60% confluency in T175 flasks using the calciumphosphate method with 70 µg of total DNA. The ratio of 5:5:1 by mass was used for the
retroviral vector pQCXIX encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP) or firefly luciferase
(FLuc), a plasmid expressing MLV gag and pol proteins, and a plasmid expressing the S
protein of SARS-CoV-2 or VSV G protein. The plasmid expressing VSV G protein was
previously reported31. SARS-CoV-2 S protein gene used in the production of MLV PVs
was codon-optimized and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies based on the
protein sequence (GenBank YP_009724390). The S protein gene is fused to the Flag tag
sequence (DYKDDDDK) either at its C-terminus or at both the N- and C-termini, as
indicated in each experiment. PV-containing culture supernatants were collected at 43 h
post transfection, cleared through 0.45 µm filters, and either purified or aliquoted and
frozen at -80°C immediately.
PV titers were quantified by RT-qPCR, using primers and a probe that target the CMV
promoter. Sense primer: 5’-TCACGGGGATTTCCAAGTCTC-3’, anti-sense primer: 5’-

AAACAAACTCCCATTGACGTCA-3’. Viral RNA was extracted with Trizol (Life
Technologies) and GlycoBlue coprecipitant (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed using the
High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). qPCR was
performed using Luna Universal Probe qPCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs) with
the known quantity of pQCXIX vector to generate standard curves.
Infection assays were performed by spinoculating (at 2,100 x g for 30 min at 10°C) PVs
onto the Mock- and hACE2-293T cells seeded on multiwell plates. Spinoculated plates
were incubated for 2 h in a CO2 incubator and medium was replaced with DMEM
containing 10% FBS. Infection levels were assessed 24 h post infection by measuring
GFP expression by Accuri flow cytometer or luciferase activity using the Luc-Pair Firefly
Luciferase HS Assay Kit (GeneCopoeia).

Analyses of the S protein incorporated into MLV PV. For the analyses of the S protein
in the virion, PVs were partially purified. 9 ml of cleared culture supernatants containing
PVs (20 ml/T175) were loaded onto 2 ml of 20% sucrose in PBS and centrifuged at
30,000 rpm in the SW41 rotor for 2 h at 10°C32. PV pellets were resuspended in 30-50 µl
NT buffer (120 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH8.0). Purified PVs were immediately used or
aliquoted and frozen at -80°C. For western blot analyses, 5-10 µl of purified PV, which is
equivalent to 0.5-1.0 x 1010 vector genomes, was loaded per lane of the 4-12% Bis-Tris
gel (Life Technologies), transferred to the PVDF membrane, and blotted with 1 µg/ml
anti-Flag M2 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804) to detect the S-protein bands. 1 µg/ml

mouse IgG-HRP polyclonal antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 115-036-062) were
used to detect MLV gag protein as an internal control. Band intensities were measured,
using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad). To increase the accuracy of this measurement, the
same blots were analyzed several times at different exposures. For silver staining, 30 µl
of purified PVs were separated by the 4-12% Bis-Tris gel and stained with Silver Stain
Plus (Bio-Rad).

VLP production and S-protein analysis. SARS-CoV-2 VLPs were produced by
transfecting HEK293T cells at ~60% confluency in T75 flasks with 25 µg total DNA
using the calcium phosphate method as previously described with a modification34. The
plasmids expressing SARS-CoV-2 M, N, E, and S proteins were transfected at a ratio of
1:5:5:1. The codon-optimized M, N, and E protein genes were synthesized based on the
GenBank protein sequences, YP_009724393, YP_009724397, and YP_009724392,
respectively. VLPs were harvested 43 h post transfection from the culture supernatants,
cleared by 0.45 µm filtration, and partially purified by pelleting through a 20% sucrose
layer as were MLV PVs. VLP pellets were resuspended in 30 µl of NT buffer, and the
entire amount was loaded on the 4-12% Bis-Tris gel for WB analyses. As with MLV PV,
the S-protein bands were visualized using the anti-Flag M2 antibody, and the N-protein
band was detected using pooled convalescent plasma at a 1:500 dilution and 10 ng/ml
goat-anti-human IgG antibody conjugated with polymerized HRP (Fitzgerald, 61RI166AHRP40).

Cell-surface expression and analysis of the S protein. HEK293T cells, approximately
80% confluent in 6-well plates were transfected with 8 µl PEI 40,000 (Polysciences) and
2 µg plasmid expressing the indicated S protein variant. For ACE2-NN-Ig binding
experiments, the S protein constructs with the Flag tag only at the C-terminus, and for the
measurement of total S1, those with N-terminal Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) and C-terminal
Flag tag (DYKDDDDK) are used. All tags are fused with a two-glycine (GG) linker. To
measure ACE2-binding ability or the level of the S1 domain present on the cell surface,
cells were detached two days post transfection with Accutase (Stemcell Technologies
Inc.) and incubated with either 1 µg/ml purified hACE2-NN-Ig or anti-Myc antibody
(clone 9E10, National Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN), respectively, on ice.
hACE2-NN-Ig was previous described and was purified using Protein A-Sepharose CL4B (GE Healthcare)31. To measure the total level of S protein, cells were permeabilized
with PBS including 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 10 min
and incubated with 1 µg/ml anti-Flag M2 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich).

Figure 2. Superior infectivity of G614 results from decreased S1 shedding and higher level of S
protein in the virion. a-f, Indicated MLV PVs produced with the S protein containing the Flag tag at
both the N- and C-termini were partially purified and concentrated by pelleting through a 20% sucrose
layer. PV titers were assessed by RT-qPCR (a). The same symbols in different PV groups indicate they
are from the same batch. The same PVs were assessed for their infectivity in Mock- and hACE2-293T
cells (b). Each symbol in (a,b) indicates an average value of a duplicated experiment. Mean ± SEM of
three independently prepared PVs (a) and four experiments using those three PV batches (b) are shown.
The same amount (1 x 1010 vg per lane) (c,d) or to more accurately compare the S1 and S2 ratio, different
amount (e) of the purified PVs were analyzed by WB using the anti-Flag M2 antibody or anti-p30 MLV
gag antibody. A similar experiment performed with an independently prepared batch of PVs is shown in
Extended Data Fig 2a. The same PVs visualized by silver stain is shown in Extended Data Fig. 2b. Total
virion S protein (d) and the S1/S2 ratio (f) of PVD614 and PVG614 were calculated from four (d) or five (f)
WBs performed with three independently prepared PV batches and presented as mean ± SEM. Significant
differences were analyzed by one-way ANOVA (a), two-way ANOVA with Sidak multiple comparison
tests of log-transformed data (b), or unpaired Student’s t-test (d,f).

Fig. 3. SARS-CoV-2 VLPG614 also	   exhibits	   decreased	   S1	   shedding	   and	   increased	   total	   virion	   S	  
protein.	   a-­‐c,	   VLPs were produced from HEK293T cell transfection of the M, N, E, and S proteins of

SARS-CoV-2. VLPs were harvested from the culture supernatant and partially purified as MLV PVs. The
S protein bands were visualized using the anti-Flag tag M2 antibody and the N protein band using pooled
convalescent plasma (a). A representative of WBs performed with three independently prepared VLPs is
shown. The S1/S2 ratio (b) and the difference in total virion S protein (c) incorporated into the VLPD614
and VLPG614 were calculated from four WBs performed with three independent VLP preparations and
presented as mean ± SEM. Significant differences were analyzed by unpaired Student’s t-test.

Fig 4. PVG614 is not more resistant to neutralization than does PVD614. a, The S protein containing Cterminal Flag tag is transfected into HEK293T cells and assessed for hACE2-NN-Ig binding. Total S
protein was measured by detecting the Flag tag in the permeabilized cells. The ratio of hACE2-NN-Ig
binding to Flag-tag staining is shown. b, Experiments similar to those in (a) except the S protein contains
N-Myc and C-Flag tags, and S1 level was assessed using an anti-Myc antibody. Each symbol in (a,b)
indicates an average value of a duplicated experiment. The data in (a,b) before normalization are
presented in Extended Data Fig. 3a,b. Mean ± SEM of three independent experiments are presented.
Significant differences were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Sidak multiple comparisons test. c, MLV
PVs expressing firefly luciferase and pseudotyped with the indicated S protein or VSV G protein were
preincubated without (presented at x = -6) or with serially diluted plasmas derived from convalescent
COVID-19 patients or a SARS-CoV naïve individual. hACE2-293T cells were infected with these
preincubated mixes and infection was assessed 24 h later by measuring luciferase activity. Mean ± SEM
of three-five independent experiments are presented.

Extended Data Fig. 1. Titers of various MLV PVs. The titers of the MLV PVs used in the experiments
shown in Fig. 1c,d were quantified by RT-qPCR. The same symbols in different PV groups indicate they
were from the same batch. Each symbol indicates an average value of a duplicated experiment. Similar
PV titers validate that enhanced infectivity of PVG614 was not resulted from a large difference in virus
titers and/or normalization thereof. Mean ± SEM of two independent PV preparations are shown.
Significant differences were analyzed by one-way ANOVA.

Extended Data Fig. 2. Superior infectivity of G614 results from decreased S1 shedding and higher
level of S protein in the virion. a, A similar experiment as that shown in Fig. 2c but performed with an
independently prepared PV batch. b, The same PVs used in the experiment shown in Fig. 2c were
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver stain to avoid a potential bias caused by using the M2 antibody that
recognizes N- and C-terminal Flag tags with different affinity. Although the S2 band is masked by an
MLV-derived protein, the S1 band is clearly separated and much weaker in PVD614 compared to that in
PVG614.
