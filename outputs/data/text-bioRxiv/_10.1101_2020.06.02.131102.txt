Abstract:

11

SARS-CoV-2 causes ongoing infections worldwide, and identifying people with immunity is

12

becoming increasingly important. Available point-of-care diagnostic systems as lateral flow assays

13

have high potential for fast and easy on-site antibody testing but are lacking specificity, sensitivity

14

or possibility for quantitative measurements. Here, a new point-of-care approach for SARS-CoV-2

15

specific antibody detection in human serum based on magnetic immuno-detection is described and

16

compared to standard ELISA. For magnetic immuno-detection, immunofiltration columns were

17

coated with a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide. SARS-CoV-2 peptide reactive antibodies, spiked

18

at different concentrations into PBS and human serum, were rinsed through immunofiltration

19

columns. Specific antibodies were retained within the IFC and labelled with an isotype specific

20

biotinylated antibody. Streptavidin-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles were applied to label the

21

secondary antibodies. Enriched magnetic nanoparticles were then detected by means of frequency

22

magnetic mixing detection technology, using a portable magnetic read-out device. Measuring

23

signals corresponded to the amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in the sample. Our

24

preliminary magnetic immuno-detection setup resulted in a higher sensitivity and broader

times to that of a typical lateral flow assay, enabling a fast and easy approach, well suited for point-

1. Introduction

31

The new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is causing ongoing

32

worldwide infections, leading to an unprecedented pandemic. According to World Health

33

Organization (WHO), it is estimated that up to 82% of people with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-

34

19) are not aware that they are/were infected due to no or very mild symptoms [1]. COVID-19

35

symptoms can be noted comparable to common cold cough, rhinitis or fever up to harsh symptoms,

36

especially at elderly, such as respiratory problems with lung failure and death [2, 3]. Patients with

37

few or no symptoms in particular pose the greatest risk, as they can infect many more people via a

38

droplet infection [4]. Identifying people who were infected and have obtained immunity against

39

SARS-CoV-2 is becoming highly important. Besides valuable epidemiological information regarding

40

distribution and spreading behavior, detection methods would help to manage the currently imposed

41

restrictions and non-pharmaceutical measures. All people with confirmed immunity most probably

42

would have no risk to infect themselves and thus would not represent a risk of infection for others.

43

At a later point, serological assays would also be required to prove and monitor effectivity of

44

vaccination and longevity of the obtained immunity. Fast, cheap and easily applicable on-site testing

45

solutions will thus become increasingly important, but currently only few rapid test systems are

46

available. Lateral-flow-detection (LFD) approaches are easy to handle and results are gained after 10-

47

15 min. However they are not quantitative, and their reliability, specificity and sensitivity is much

48

worse than that of lab-based assay formats based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

49

In particular, specificity is a major challenge at currently available serological antibody tests. This

50

depends to a large extent on the antigen used in the test assays. Enveloped positive-stranded RNA

51

SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses consist of five structural proteins, the spike glycoprotein (S), envelope

52

protein (E), membrane protein (M), the nucleocapsid protein (N) and a hemagglutinin esterase (HE).

53

The S-protein, a complex folded glycoprotein comprising two regions, S1 and S2, exhibits the highest

54

immunogenicity, has the most important role in host interaction, especially cell entry, and is also the

55

main target for neutralizing antibodies [5]. The proteins M, E and HE are only weakly immunogenic

56

and less suitable as targets for antibody diagnosis. Although the N protein is immunodominant, it is

57

not suitable for the specific analysis of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 viruses due to its

58

high cross-reactivity with antibodies targeting related coronavirius strains [6, 7]. The company

59

Euroimmun AG, Lübeck, Germany offers two ELISA kits using a genetically modified N-protein

60

variant, which enables a more specific detection of antibodies already ten days after infection.

61

However, for highly specific detection of immune response against SARS-CoV-2, typically the S1

62

subunit of S-protein should be used. Currently, only few vendors offer these specific ELISA formats

63

using the S1 subunit of S-protein for specifically detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [8, 9].

64

Nevertheless, specific, sensitive and quantitative rapid tests applicable for a decentralized point-of-

65

care (PoC) analysis are currently not available.

66

Magnetic Immuno-Detection (MInD) could be a powerful tool for PoC assay performance. MInD

67

employs immunofiltration columns (IFCs) containing a porous polyethylene matrix coated with

68

antigens retaining reactive antibodies from applied samples flushed through IFC by gravity flow.

69

Afterward, secondary antibodies specifically binding to the previously enriched antibodies are

70

applied, and subsequently specially functionalized magnetic particles (MNPs) are added, labelling

71

the secondary antibodies. After a washing step to elute unbound MNPs, IFSc are simply inserted into

72

the detection head of a portable magnetic read-out device in which retained MNPs are then detected

73

by means of frequency magnetic mixing detection technology (FMMD), using a low- and a high-

74

frequency magnetic excitation field [10-17]. An alternately oscillating positive and negative magnetic

75

saturation of MNPs with a frequency of 2·f2 of 122 Hz is obtained when exposing the particle to a low

76

frequency magnetic field of frequency f2 = 61 Hz with an amplitude of a few millitesla [10]. Afterward,

77

the magnetization state of MNPs is probed by the high frequency magnetic excitation field with

78

f1 = 49 kHz. An iron oxide dose-dependent signal is obtained when the resulting mixing frequency

79

signal of f1 + 2·f2 is detected by a Faraday coil. The innermost coil is composed of two adjacent sections,

80

a so-called detection coil directly encircling the IFC, and a reversely wound empty reference coil, so

81

that the directly induced signal from the excitation coils is cancelled while retaining the nonlinear

82

response signal from the MNPs. A detailed description is found in Ref. [10]. An easy application of

83

this technique is guaranteed due to a direct visualization of the resulting measuring signal at the

84

touchscreen of our portable magnetic read-out device.

85

We here present a preliminary MInD proof-of-concept study in comparison to a standard

86

laboratory-based ELISA, demonstrating an improved detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies

87

spiked in human serum samples. We therefore employed a peptide originating from the SARS-CoV-2

88

Spike protein for IFC coating and antibody enrichment. Our approach might facilitate further

89

optimization to obtain a timely PoC setup for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in human

90

blood samples.

122

spike protein peptide was diluted in coupling buffer to a concentration of 2 µg·ml–1 and plated with

123

100 µl per well onto a high-binding 96-well microtiter plate and incubated. After 3 subsequent

124

125

washing, 100 µl of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide specific antibody in concentrations ranging

126

from 1.22 ng·ml–1 to 5000 ng·ml–1 diluted in PBS or in human serum acquired in 2016, respectively,

127

were applied onto the microtiter plate. For blank measurements, PBS or human serum without spiked

128

antibody was employed. After incubation, the plate was washed again. Afterward, 100 µl of

129

biotinylated GaR secondary antibody, diluted 1:20,000 in PBS, was added to each well and incubated.

130

After washing three times with PBS-T, 100 µl of streptavidin-AP (diluted 1:1000 in PBS) was added

131

and incubated for 30 minutes. After washing, absorbance was measured using a Tecan Infinite M200

132

microplate reader at 405 nm after application of AP-substrate in AP-buffer and 5 minutes of

133

incubation in dark.

135

2.3 Preparation of MInD Immunifiltration Columns

136

For MInD, IFCs were equilibrated as described by Rettcher et al. (2015) [16]. After equilibration,

137

IFCs were coated with 500 µl of 2 µg·ml–1 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide, diluted in coupling

138

buffer. After the solution flushed through by gravity flow, a 60 minutes incubation step was

139

performed. Afterward, IFCs were washed by applying 750 µl PBS. Subsequently, remaining binding

140

sites within the polyethylene filter matrix were blocked by applying twice 750 µl BP and an

141

incubation of 20 minutes after each application. After washing of the columns with 750 µl of PBS,

142

IFCs were ready to use for MInD SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide specific antibody detection. Pre-

143

coated, ready-to use IFCs could be stored at 4°C for at least several days until they were used for the

144

assay.

148

peptide, dilutions of an antibody with known specificity for this Spike-protein peptide ranging from

149

1.22 ng·ml–1 to 5000 ng·ml–1 in PBS or in human serum acquired in 2016, respectively, were prepared

151

flow, SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were enriched within the matrix by specific binding to the

152

coated antigen. After 12 minutes of incubation, IFCs were washed with 750 µl PBS and 500 µl of

153

biotinylated GaR (diluted 1:2500 in PBS) were applied onto the columns, binding to retained

154

antibodies. After further incubation of 12 minutes, IFCs were washed again and 500 µl of 60 µg·ml–1

155

70 nm superparamagnetic streptavidin-functionalized magnetic particles were applied and flushed

156

through the IFCs and incubated for 12 minutes. After a final washing with 750 µl PBS, read-out was

157

done by inserting the columns into the portable magnetic reader, detecting the measuring signal in

158

mV as previously described by Rettcher et al. (2015) [16].

160

Data Analysis

161

For ELISA as well as for MInD, data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0.0, and fitting with

162

a Hill slope was performed. Equations (1) and (2) were used to determine the limit of detection (LOD)

163

or maximum of detection (MOD), respectively, on the signal scale and Equation (3) was used for

164

calculation of those parameters on the concentration scale. SD denotes the standard deviation.

3.1. ELISA-based Calibration Experiments of SARS-CoV-2 Specific Antibody Detection

173

As reference method to our PoC MInD approach, a typical laboratory-based ELISA was performed

174

(Fig 1). After coating of ELISA microtiter plate with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide and blocking

175

with BSA, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide specific antibody was diluted in the range from

176

1.22 ng·ml–1 to 5000 ng·ml–1 in PBS-buffer or serum and applied into wells. After addition of

177

biotinylated GaR and subsequent labelling with streptavidin-AP, the ELISA plate was read out at

178

405 nm and obtained measuring values were used to generate calibration curves for SARS-CoV-2

179

specific antibody concentrations in PBS (Fig 1, black curve) and in human serum samples (Fig 1, red

180

curve). Blank values determined in PBS and serum were 0.085 AU ± 0.005 AU and

181

0.083 AU ± 0.001 AU, respectively, and were subtracted from sample values. Both curves recorded

182

with antigen diluted in PBS and human blood serum were almost identical. Based on a Hill fit,

183

calibration measurements in PBS with a LOD 3.4 ng·ml–1 and or LOD of 4.0 ng·ml–1 in human serum

184

were obtained (Fig 1). Both calibration measurements show saturation of measuring signals at

185

concentrations with 625 ng·ml–1 up to 5000 ng·ml–1. For calculation of maximum of detection,

186

the average measuring signal of samples with concentrations ranging from 625 ng·ml–1 up to

187

5000 ng·ml–1 was calculated and threefold SD was subtracted. Using equation 3, a MOD of

188

477 ng·ml–1 in PBS and of 312 ng·ml–1 in serum, respectively, could be determined. Following these

189

calibration measurements, it can be concluded, that with our laboratory-based ELISA, SARS-CoV-2

190

specific antibodies can be detected in range of 3.4 ng·ml–1 up to 477 ng·ml–1 in PBS-buffer or from

191

4.0 ng·ml–1 up to 312 ng·ml–1 in human serum samples, respectively. Typical IgG antibody

192

concentrations in human serum are approximately 10 mg·ml–1, and are significantly increasing after

193

antigenic stimulation of immune system [18]. For the whole assay, excluding coating and blocking

194

but including application of sample, secondary antibody, streptavidin-AP and substrate incubation,

195

a procedure time of 161 minutes was needed. This time is comparable to that of commercially

196

available ELISA test kits (e.g. Euroimmun 140 min). Comparing the sensitivity of commercially

197

available ELISA test kits with our standard ELISA will be possible when samples of COVID-19

198

patients are evaluated. A highly sensitive assay could detect antibodies at an early stage of infection,

199

whereas commercially test kits can detect IgG antibodies in patient samples against S1 subunit of

200

SARS CoV-2 S-protein in 75% of samples 10 to 20 days after infection (Euroimmun).

Fig 1. ELISA-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein specific antibody in PBS-buffer (black

204

1.22 ng·ml–1 up to 5000 ng·ml–1 in each matrix and applied onto 2 ng·ml–1 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

205

peptide coated and BSA blocked microtiter plates. After addition of biotinylated secondary antibody,

206

streptavidin-AP was applied. Limit of detection (LOD) was calculated using non-linear Hill fit

207

(R2=0.997 for PBS-buffer and 0.996 in serum). Assay time of ELISA was 161 minutes. Each data point

208

represents mean ± SD (n = 4 for PBS-buffer and n = 3 for serum).

210

3.1. MInD-based Calibration Experiments for SARS-CoV-2 Specific Antibody Detection

211

Same calibration measurements employing dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody were

212

done with our PoC MInD-based setup (Fig 2 and 3). Comparable to laboratory-based ELISA, the same

213

dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide specific antibody in PBS-buffer (Fig 3, black curve) or

214

human serum (Fig 3, red curve) were applied after coating and blocking of IFC with SARS-CoV-2

215

spike protein peptide and BSA. After application of antibody dilutions, a 5-times shorter incubation

216

time of just 12 minutes compared to ELISA was performed. The reduction of incubation time could

217

be achieved due to a more efficient antibody enrichment. The surface for target binding within the

218

ABICAP immunofiltration column matrix is approximately 40-fold larger compared to the surface of

219

an ELISA well. Furthermore 500 µl of sample was applied and flushed through IFC, compared to just

220

100 µl of sample added to an ELISA microtiter plate well. Afterward, biotinylated GaR was applied

221

onto columns and magnetically labelled with 70 nm streptavidin-functionalized magnetic particles.

222

Again, incubation time of only 12 minutes each could be used due to the increased binding surface.

223

Finally, the IFCs were inserted into our portable magnetic read-out device which can be operated

224

using either an external power adapter or a portable battery, allowing a PoC diagnostic assay

225

procedure. A schematic overview of assay procedure is shown in Fig 2.

226
227

Fig 2. Proof-of-concept MInD assay setup using IFC coated with SARS-CoV-2 antigen. Assay steps

228

and assay time are indicated. IFCs were coated with commercial SARS-CoV-2 S-protein peptide and

229

blocked with BSA. Corresponding antibody was diluted either in PBS or spiked in human serum and

230

applied to IFCs. Biotinylated secondary antibodies were added, followed by application of

231

streptavidin-functionalized MNP. Finally, IFCs were inserted into the portable magnetic read-out

232

device. Measuring signal can be correlated to the amount of antibody in the sample and antibody titer

233

can be determined. Assay time of this preliminary MInD setup was 42 min which is approximately

234

four times faster than ELISA (161 min).

235

As shown in Fig 3, also with MInD-based approach SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody detection

236

calibration curves could be recorded using PBS-buffer or human serum, respectively. Particularly the

237

comparable calibration measurements in PBS or human serum demonstrate the negligible matrix

238

effect of human serum when using MInD. Compared to standard ELISA, a saturation of measurement

239

signal was observed only at samples with higher concentrations of 2500 ng·ml–1 and 5000 ng·ml–1.

240

Based on this, the average of these two samples was used for calculation of the MOD (Equation 2 and

241

3). By analyzing the range of detection, it can be seen that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide specific

242

antibody can be detected in range of 2.95 ng·ml–1 up to 2040 ng·ml–1 in PBS and from 3.36 ng·ml–1 up

243

to 1810 ng·ml–1, demonstrating an at least 5-fold broader range of quantification in both PBS and

244

human serum with higher sensitivities compared to ELISA and perfectly matching nonlinear fit

245

(R2 =0.997 in PBS and R2 =0.993 in human serum). This significantly increased dynamic range

246

compared to ELISA demonstrates one major advantage enabling improved quantitative

247

measurements.

42 minutes (without column preparation). Limit of detection (LOD) was determined by help of

255

non-linear hill fit. Each data point represents mean ± SD (n = 2).

256
257

Furthermore, an approximately 4-fold reduction of assay time with PoC MInD approach

258

compared to ELISA demonstrates the high potential for fast assay procedure. In total, 42 minutes

259

procedure time was needed, resulting in a broader detection range in combination with lower

260

detection limits in both PBS and human serum. A further reduction of assay time could be achieved by

261

checking the required amount of washing steps and analyzing the achieved sensitivity when reducing

262

the incubation time to 5 minutes or less, as described by Rettcher et al. (2015) [16]. Additionally, Rettcher

263

and colleagues demonstrated a reduction of assay time by pre-functionalizing the MNPs with antigen-

264

specific antibodies [16]. Here, MNPs can be pre-functionalized with secondary antibody, which would

265

result, in combination with previously mentioned optimization steps, in less assay steps with a

266

comparable assay time as PoC lateral flow assays (less than 20 minutes).

267

In this proof-of-concept experiment, a commercially available SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

268

peptide with corresponding antibody was used. If using this peptide for testing of patient samples,

269

there might be a high risk for false negative assay results, since patients may not have developed

270

antibodies against this peptide. Most preferably, other antigen variants derived from the highly

271

immunogenic S1-subunit of S-protein or a mixture of antigens of SARS-CoV-2 proteins should be

272

used for highly effective and specific enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibodies. Especially for

273

demonstration of MInD specificity, control antigens derived from common cold human

274

coronaviruses (hCoV) as hCoV 229E, hCoV NL63, hCoV OC43, hCoV HKU1 or SARS-CoV and

275

MERS-CoV should be tested, confirming the enrichment of only SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies.

276

Additionally, a multiplex detection of different MNPs, as demonstrated by Achtsnicht et al. (2019),

277

could be implemented for detection of multiple antibody subclasses in one assay [19]. By coupling

different secondary antibodies to MNPs, each type will label a specific antibody isotype, as e.g. IgA

279

and IgG, a course of infection could be visualized as well as the analysis of seroconversion would be

280

enabled. A further optimization of the magnetic read-out device towards a medical-diagnostic device

281

would then fulfill all requirements for use in medical field. To ensure correct sample allocation, the

282

magnetic reader can be equipped with a barcode scanner, and IFCs could be labelled with a patient-

283

specific barcode. In combination with multiplex detection of several antibody isotypes, the MInD

284

approach would thus be ideally suited for the use in doctors' surgeries since our MInD assay has less

285

than 10% of the cost for typical ELISA equipment. Especially due to the possibility of performing the

286

PoC assay procedure with a single pipette, and the portable magnetic read-out device which can be

287

battery-operated, the MInD assay can also be used by service providers in the medical field and for

288

testing in elderly peoples’ and nursing homes or at airports, quickly identifying persons with existing

289

immunity. As soon as vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is available, our approach could be employed

290

to monitor vaccination success and longevity of immunity by determining antibody titers.

291

4. Conclusions

292

We demonstrated for the first time a proof-of-concept MInD-based approach for rapid and highly

293

sensitive SARS-CoV-2 S-protein peptide specific antibody detection in spiked human serum. MInD

294

calibration experiments with a five-fold higher range of detection in combination with higher sensitivity

295

and a four-fold shorter assay time in comparison to a standard ELISA demonstrate the high potential

296

of MInD-based PoC SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody detection in serological samples. By using

297

appropriate SARS-CoV-2 antigens and a multiplex approach for simultaneous detection of e.g. IgA and

298

IgG antibodies reactive against SARS-CoV-2, the state of infection as well as a seroconversion could be

299

analyzed. Especially due to assay speed, low-cost and portable equipment, we conclude that the MInD-

300

based assay would be ideally suited for PoC testing, identifying persons with existing immunity.

301

Additionally, our MInD approach could be employed for subsequent analysis of efficiency and for

302

monitoring the longevity of vaccination by determining antibody titers.
