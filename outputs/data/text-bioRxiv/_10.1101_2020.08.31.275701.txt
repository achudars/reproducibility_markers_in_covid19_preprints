ABSTRACT

50

There is dire need for an effective and affordable vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 to

51

tackle the ongoing pandemic. In this study, we describe a modular virus-like particle

52

vaccine candidate displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding

53

domain (RBD) using SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology (RBD-SpyVLP). Low doses of

54

RBD-SpyVLP in a prime-boost regimen induced a strong neutralising antibody

55

response in mice and pigs that was superior to convalescent human sera. We

56

evaluated antibody quality using ACE2 blocking and neutralisation of cell infection by

57

pseudovirus or wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Using competition assays with a monoclonal

58

antibody panel, we showed that RBD-SpyVLP induced a polyclonal antibody response

59

that recognised all key epitopes on the RBD, reducing the likelihood of selecting

60

neutralisation-escape mutants. The induction of potent and polyclonal antibody

61

responses by RBD-SpyVLP provides strong potential to address clinical and logistic

62

challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, RBD-SpyVLP is highly resilient,

63

thermostable and can be lyophilised without losing immunogenicity, to facilitate global

64

distribution and reduce cold-chain dependence.

INTRODUCTION

69

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus named severe

70

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in Wuhan,

71

China in December 2019 1. Since then COVID-19 has spread across the world and

72

was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in March 2020. As

73

of August 2020, there have been over 20 million confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide

74

and around 800,000 deaths 2. There are no vaccines or effective treatments for

75

COVID-19 to date; however, as of August 2020, there are 25 vaccine candidates in

76

clinical evaluation and around 140 are in pre-clinical testing 3. Vaccine candidates in

77

current clinical evaluation include inactivated, viral vector (replicating and non-

78

replicating), protein subunit, nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and virus-like particle (VLP)

79

vaccines with the majority of them focusing on using the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike

80

glycoprotein (S) as an immunogen.

81
82

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus carrying a single-stranded positive-sense RNA

83

genome (~30 kb), belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus from the Coronaviridae

84

family 4. The virus RNA encodes four structural proteins including spike (S), envelope

85

(E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, 16 non-structural proteins, and

86

nine accessory proteins 5. The S glycoprotein consists of an ectodomain (that can be

87

processed into S1 and S2 subunits), a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular

88

domain 6. Similar to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-

89

CoV), SARS-CoV-2 binds the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the

90

receptor-binding domain (RBD) within the S1 subunit to facilitate entry into host cells,

91

followed by membrane fusion mediated by the S2 subunit 7-9

92
93

Of the many vaccine platforms, protein subunit vaccines generally have good safety

94

profiles and their production is rapid and easily scalable 10. Recombinant RBD proteins

95

of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been shown to be immunogenic and induce

96

protective neutralising antibodies in animal models and are therefore considered

97

promising vaccine candidates (reviewed

11, 12

). RBD from SARS-CoV- has recently

98

been confirmed to be inducing neutralising antibodies 13, 14. Recently published studies,

99

including one from our group, found that the majority of the potent neutralising
15, 16

100

antibodies isolated from SARS-CoV-2- infected patients bound to the RBD

101

therefore chose to study the immunogenicity of RBD. To improve immunogenicity, we

102

conjugated the RBD onto a virus-like particle (VLP). VLP display of protein antigen

103

has been shown to further enhance immunogenicity by facilitating antigen drainage to

104

lymph nodes, enhancing uptake by antigen-presenting cells and increasing B cell

105

receptor crosslinking

(haemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA)) displayed on the VLPs (same VLP used

107

in this study) were highly immunogenic at a low dose (0.1 µg) in mice 18.

109

In the present study, we used the SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology for assembly of

110

SARS-CoV-2 RBD on the mi3 VLP, via the formation of an intermolecular isopeptide

111

bond between the RBD and the VLP, as a potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine 19, 20 (Figure

112

1A). SpyTag-mediated VLP decoration has been successfully used for the display of

113

diverse antigens from, e.g. Plasmodium spp., influenza A virus, HIV and cancer cells

114

(PD-1L) 18, 19, 21, 22. The RBD-SpyVLP vaccine candidate is highly immunogenic in mice

115

and pigs, inducing robust SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody responses. The results

116

of our study demonstrate the potential of the RBD-SpyVLPs as an effective and

117

affordable vaccine for COVID-19 with RBD-SpyVLP being resilient, retaining stability

118

and immunogenicity post-lyophilisation, which will greatly facilitate distribution for

119

vaccination by eliminating cold-chain dependence.

RESULTS

122

1. RBD can be efficiently displayed on the mi3 VLP via SpyTag/SpyCatcher

123

To create the RBD-SpyVLP vaccine candidate, the SpyTag (AHIVMVDAYKPTK)

124

coding sequence was fused between the signal sequence from influenza H7 HA and

125

the

126

(A/HongKong/125/2017) (SpyTag-RBD) (see Figure S1 for the full sequence) and the

127

glycoprotein was expressed in mammalian cells (Expi293) prior to purification using

132

computationally engineered dodecahedron based on an aldolase from a thermophilic

133

bacterium 20, 25. The SpyTag-RBD can be efficiently conjugated to the SpyCatcher-mi3

134

VLP, with 93% display efficiency reached after 16 h (Figure 1B). This corresponds to

135

an average of 56 RBDs per VLP. We saw no sign of VLP aggregation following

136

coupling and the RBD-SpyVLP is homogeneous, as shown by a uniform peak of the

137

hydrodynamic radius (RH) at 20.7 ± 4.2 nm in dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Figure

138

1C). For immunisation, we chose a conjugation ratio that leaves minimal free RBD

139

(1:1 molar ratio), which corresponds to ~64% display efficiency or around 38 RBD per

140

VLP (Figure 1B).

141
142

2. RBD-SpyVLP is reactive to monoclonal antibodies isolated from recovered
patients and is resilient

143
144

To confirm the antigenicity of RBD-SpyVLP, we performed a series of binding assays.

145

Binding to RBD-SpyVLP was tested using a panel of novel monoclonal antibodies

146

(mAbs) some of which are strongly neutralising, from COVID-19-infected donors

147

that bind to at least three independent epitopes on the RBD. We included the

148

published conformation-specific mAb (CR3022)

149

28

150

tested mAbs and ACE2-Fc bound strongly to the RBD-SpyVLP (Figure 2A), showing

151

that a broad range of epitopes on the RBD-SpyVLP are exposed and correctly folded.

152

An anti-influenza neuraminidase mAb (Flu mAb), used as a negative control, showed

153

no binding to RBD-SpyVLP, confirming the specificity of the assay (Figure 2A).

155

We then tested the stability of RBD-SpyVLP, to determine its resilience and likely

156

sensitivity to failures in the cold-chain 30. The unconjugated SpyCatcher003-mi3 VLP

had previously been shown to be highly thermostable as a platform for antigen display

weeks at -80, -20, 4 or 25 °C in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS). We then centrifuged out

160

any aggregates and analysed soluble protein by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining.

161

We found no significant change in the soluble fraction following storage at 4 °C (n=3,

162

Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s post-hoc test, p>0.05), with only a 12% decrease after

163

storage for two weeks at 25 °C (Figure 2B) and no degradation was observed at 25 °C

164

(Figure S2A). We further analysed the integrity of the sample with ELISA against the

165

conformation-dependent CR3022 mAb and observed no loss of antigenicity under

. For conjugated RBD-SpyVLP, we tested its solubility following storage for two

166

these storage conditions (Figure 2C). We next assessed the resilience of RBD-

167

SpyVLP to freezing, challenging RBD-SpyVLP with multiple rounds of freeze-thaw.

168

Even after five rounds of freeze-thaw, there was no significant loss of soluble RBD-

169

SpyVLP (Figure 2D) or CR3022 recognition (Figure 2E) (n=3, Kruskal-Wallis and

170

Dunn’s post-hoc test, p>0.05) and no degradation was observed (Figure S2B). After

171

reconstitution following lyophilisation, we saw a minimal change in soluble protein for

172

RBD-SpyVLP (91.5±3.8% of the initial value (mean±SD) (Figure 2F), which was not

173

statistically significant (n=3, Mann-Whitney U test, p>0.05). There was also no

174

difference in terms of binding of RBD-SpyVLP to a panel of mAbs or ACE2-Fc

175

recognising non-overlapping footprints on the RBD (Figure 2G). Overall, RBD-SpyVLP

176

showed a high level of resilience.

177
178
179

3. RBD-SpyVLP induces a strong ACE2-blocking and neutralising antibody
response in mouse models

180

We first evaluated the immunogenicity of RBD-SpyVLP in mouse models. C57BL/6

181

mice (n=6) were immunised intramuscularly (IM) with purified RBD alone (0.1 µg or

182

0.5 µg), RBD-SpyVLP (0.1 µg or 0.5 µg equivalents of the RBD component) or VLP

183

alone, all adjuvanted with AddaVax. AddaVax is a squalene-based oil-in-water nano-

184

emulsion adjuvant, a pre-clinical equivalent to the licensed MF59 adjuvant

185

were then boosted with the same dose of immunogen two weeks later and sera were

186

collected at three weeks post-boost. Both the 0.1 µg and 0.5 µg RBD-only groups

187

showed levels of antibody against RBD or spike glycoprotein only slightly above

188

background, detected using ELISA (serum reciprocal endpoint titre (EPT): 1:94 and

189

1:68, respectively), and showed no difference compared to the VLP-only group (Figure

190

3A and B). Mice immunised with 0.1 µg and 0.5 µg RBD-SpyVLP groups showed high

191

levels of antibody to RBD (EPT: 0.1 µg: 1:16,117, p<0.001 and 0.5 µg: 1:7,300, p<0.01)

192

(Figure 3A) and to spike (EPT: 0.1 µg: 1:1,647, p<0.05 and 0.5 µg: 1:1,212) compared

193

to the VLP group (Figure 3B).

31

. Mice

194
195

We then tested RBD-SpyVLP in a second mouse strain (BALB/c) with the same

196

dosage regimen to confirm the immunogenicity (Figure 3A and B). In BALB/c, the 0.1

197

µg and 0.5 µg RBD-SpyVLP groups showed higher levels of RBD-specific antibody

198

(EPT: 0.1 µg: 1:8,406, p<0.01 and 0.5 µg: 1:16,636, p<0.05) (Figure 3A) and spike6

glycoprotein specific antibody (EPT: 0.1 µg: 1:9,574, p<0.001 and 0.5 µg: 1:18,556,

200

p<0.05) (Figure 3B) compared to the VLP group.

201
202

The ability of immunised mouse sera to block recombinant soluble ACE2 binding to

203

immobilised RBD was then assessed. Sera from the 0.1 µg and 0.5 µg RBD-SpyVLP

204

immunised C57BL/6 mice had significantly higher ACE2 blocking (IC50: 0.1 µg: 1:132,

205

p<0.05 and 0.5 µg: 1:253; p<0.05) activity compared to the VLP-immunised mice

206

(Figure 3C). C57BL/6 mice immunised with RBD-only showed no detectable ACE2

207

blocking activity, consistent with the ELISA results (Figure 3A & B). Similarly, both 0.1

208

µg and 0.5 µg RBD-SpyVLP-immunised BALB/c mice had significantly higher ACE2

209

blocking (IC50: 0.1 µg:1:200, p<0.001 and 0.5 µg: 1:560, respectively) compared to the

210

VLP immunised group (Figure 3C). In both mouse strains, 0.1 µg and 0.5 µg RBD-

211

SpyVLP immunised groups had higher antibody titres against RBD (around 5-10-fold;

212

C57BL/6, p<0.001 and p<0.0001; BALB/c, p<0.001 and p<0.0001) and ACE2 blocking

213

(around 10-50-fold; C57BL/6, p<0.0001 and p<0.0001; BALB/c, p<0.0001 and

214

p<0.0001) compared to plasma donated by patients convalescing from COVID-19

215

disease (n=28) (Figure 3B and C). Sera from BALB/c mice immunised with 0.1 µg and

216

0.5 µg RBD-SpyVLP had comparable spike glycoprotein-specific antibody responses

217

compared to convalescent humans whereas sera from C57BL/6 mice immunised with

218

either dose had higher spike gluycoprotein-specific antibody responses compared to

219

convalescent humans (around 2-fold, 0.1 µg, p<0.05 and 0.5 µg, p<0.001) (Figure 3B).

220
221

The antibody response in mice was assessed for neutralisation potency using a live

222

SARS-CoV-2 virus (hCoV-19/England/02/2020, EPI_ISL407073) neutralisation assay

223

(VNT) based on virus plaque reduction. Sera from C57BL/6 mice immunised with

224

either dose of unconjugated RBD showed low level neutralising titres (ND50 1:59 and

225

1:32) compared to the RBD-SpyVLP group, again consistent with ELISA and ACE2

226

blocking activity (Figure 3D). Both 0.1 µg and 0.5 µg RBD-SpyVLP immunised groups

227

exhibited neutralising titres in both C57BL/6 (ND50: 1:450 to 1: 2,095) and BALB/c

228

mice (ND50: 1:230 to 1:1,405) (Figure 3D). Consistent neutralising activity in sera from

229

C57BL/6 mice was found using a VNT in an independent laboratory with the hCoV-

230

19/VIC01/2020 isolate (GenBank MT007544) (Table S1).

232

We tested the immunogenicity of RBD-SpyVLP post-lyophilisation and after five

233

freeze-thaw cycles. C57BL/6 mice (n=6) were immunised IM with 0.5 µg RBD-SpyVLP

234

(pre-lyophilised, post-lyophilised or 5× freeze-thaw) and sera were harvested post

235

prime and post boost and tested for binding in a RBD ELISA. There was no difference

236

between the immune responses in all three groups tested (Figure 3E) (Kruskal-Wallis,

237

followed by Dunn’s post-hoc test, p>0.05), showing that lyophilisation and freeze-thaw

238

had not compromised the immunogenicity of the RBD-SpyVLP.

239
240
241

4. RBD-SpyVLP is highly immunogenic and induces strong neutralising
antibody response in pigs

242

We tested RBD-SpyVLP for its immunogenicity in pigs as a large, genetically outbred

243

animal model. Pigs have previously been reported to be a reliable model to study

244

vaccines for use in humans because of their highly similar physiologies and immune

245

systems

246

vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 (ChAdOx1 nCoV19)

247

(n=3) with a dose of RBD-SpyVLP that we intend to use in humans (5 µg) or with a

248

10-fold higher dose (50 µg) to study dose-response. A third group (n=3) receiving 100

249

µg of purified trimeric spike glycoprotein (spike) was included as a control. Pigs were

250

immunised IM twice, 28-days apart, with 5 µg or 50 µg RBD-SpyVLP or spike, all

251

adjuvanted with AddaVax.

32, 33

. The pig model has been used recently to test an adenovirus vector
34

. We immunised pigs

252
253

As early as day 7, pigs immunised with 50 µg RBD-SpyVLP showed a detectable anti-

254

RBD antibody response, whereas no antibody response was detected at day 7 for 5

255

µg RBD-SpyVLP or 100 µg spike groups (Figure 4A) (p<0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test).

256

The antibody response in all three groups increased gradually to day 14 when the

257

response reached a plateau. The group receiving 50 µg RBD-SpyVLP group showed

258

a trend of slightly higher antibody response than the other two groups until the day of

259

boost (day 28) (Figure 4A). The antibody response in all three groups increased by

260

around 100-fold one week after boosting and remained high until at least day 56. There

261

was no dose-response difference between the 5 µg and 50 µg RBD-SpyVLP groups

262

(p>0.5, Kruskal-Wallis test) for day 56 data (Figure 4A).

263
264

was detected post-boost at day 35 (IC50 1:10 to 1:50) and reduced at day 56 (IC50 1:5

267

to 1:25) in all three groups (Figure 4B). ACE2 blocking activities in all three groups

268

were significantly higher than for sera from convalescent humans (5 µg RBD-SpyVLP,

269

p<0.01; 50 µg RBD-SpyVLP, p<0.001; 100 µg, p<0.05), by around ~3-6-fold (p<0.05

270

and p<0.001, respectively, Kruskal-Wallis test on day 56 data).

271
272

Neutralising antibody responses in the pigs were assessed against both SARS-CoV-

273

2 pseudotyped lentivirus and live SARS-CoV-2 virus. All three groups exhibited similar

274

neutralisation titres against pseudovirus (ND50: ~1:500 to 1:4,000) after boost which

275

remained until at least day 56, with no difference between the three groups (p>0.05,

276

Kruskal-Wallis test on day 56) (Figure 4C). Similarly, no difference in neutralising

277

activity was detected in all three groups against live virus at day 21 (Figure 4D).

278

Neutralisation was detected on both day 35 and 56 in all groups, with ND50 levels

279

between 1:6,000 to 1:11,000 on day 56 and no significant difference between the three

280

groups (p>0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test on day 56 data) (Figure 4D). Nasal and oral

281

secretions were also tested for the presence of neutralising antibodies: here RBD-

282

specific IgG, but notably not IgA, was detected in all three groups with no significant

283

difference between groups post-boost for both nasal and oral secretions (p>0.05,

284

Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn’s Post-hoc) (Figure 4E & F).

285
286

We assessed the level of RBD-specific B cells in peripheral blood. The predominance

287

of an IgG response following the booster immunisation was confirmed in all three

288

groups by assessment of RBD tetramer labelling of IgM, IgG and IgA B cells in

289

peripheral blood and IgG ELISpot assay (Figure S3A & B). In each case, RBD-specific

290

IgG B cells peaked in peripheral blood shortly after the boost (Figure S3A). We also

291

performed longitudinal analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses following

292

immunisation. Intracellular cytokine staining of S-peptide-stimulated peripheral blood

293

mononuclear cells (PBMCs) demonstrated a T cell IFN-γ response, slightly larger in

294

the CD4+ than CD8+ T cell pool, which peaked 7 days after prime and boost

immunisations (Figure S3C).

300

A concern regarding RBD-based vaccines is whether the immune response will be

301

focussed to a single site on the antigen, because of the relatively small size of the RBD,

302

potentially leading to a narrow response that would be sensitive to immune escape 35, 36.

303

A recent report showed that passive immunisation with a single mAb led to escape

304

mutants of SARS-CoV-2, whereas a cocktail of two neutralising antibodies to independent

305

epitopes prevented emergence of neutralisation-escape mutations, demonstrating the

306

importance of a polyclonal antibody response 37. We assessed sera from mice and pigs

307

immunised with RBD-SpyVLP for antibody responses that target multiple RBD epitopes

308

using a competition ELISA against four different mAbs: FI-3A, FD-11A, EY6A and S309,

309

that target three non-overlapping epitopes on the RBD with FD-11A and S309 showing

310

overlap as defined by competition ELISA (see diagram in Figure 2A) 26, 38, 39,. BALB/c mice

311

immunised with RBD-SpyVLP showed competition against all four mAbs tested (Figure

312

5A). BALB/c mice immunised with VLP-only showed no competition (p<0.05, Mann

313

Whitney U-Test) (Figure 5A). A similar pattern was observed in the C57BL/6 mice (Figure

314

S5). Comparison of preimmune and day 42 post- RBD-SpyVLP-immunisation sera from

315

pigs showed a trend of partial competition against all four mAb, but this was not

316

statistically significant because of inter-animal variation (Figure 5B). When responses of

317

individual pigs were compared to their pre-immune sera 2 out of 3 animals in each dosing

318

group showed significant competition for the antibodies FI-3A and S309 that defined

319

independent neutralising epitopes compared to their preimmune sera (Figure S5). These

320

results show that RBD-SpyVLP does not have an immunodominant epitope and does not

321

induce a highly focussed antibody response, making it a vaccine candidate that is likely

322

to resist the generation of neutralisation-escape mutants.

323
324
325

DISCUSSION

326

In the current study we investigated an RBD-based VLP vaccine candidate for COVID-

327

19 based on SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology which was used to assemble RBDs into

328

the mi3 VLP via the formation of an irreversible isopeptide bond 19. We showed RBD-

329

SpyVLPs to be strongly immunogenic in mice and pigs, inducing high titre neutralising

330

antibody responses against wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study confirms that the

331

RBD is the key immunogenic domain for eliciting neutralising monoclonal antibodies

332

against SARS-CoV-2, in line with studies showing that highly neutralising antibodies

333

isolated from convalescent patients bind to the RBD

16, 26, 38, 40-46

. We showed that

RBD-SpyVLPs are recognised by a panel of mAbs isolated from convalescent patients

that all of the epitopes that could potentially induce protective antibodies to RBD are

337

present in RBD-SpyVLPs.

binding to various epitopes on the RBD (Figure 2A). This distributed reactivity shows

338
339

We detected negligible antibody responses in mice vaccinated with equivalent doses

340

(0.1 µg or 0.5 µg) of purified RBD alone, but strong responses to the RBD when

341

displayed on the VLP (Figure 3). Previous studies showed that RBD from SARS-CoV

342

and SARS-COV-2 can induce neutralising antibodies in animal models but typically

343

after administration of much higher doses (e.g. ~50 to 100 µg) and with frequent

344

dosing

345

responses can be detected in two strains of mice immunised with relatively low doses

346

of RBD-SpyVLP (to ND50 ~500 to 2,000). These results confirm the enhanced

347

immunogenicity of RBD when displayed on SpyVLPs. Sera from mice immunised with

348

both 0.1 µg or 0.5 µg of RBD-SpyVLP exhibited high levels of antibody against SARS-

349

CoV-2 RBD and full-length spike glycoprotein and ACE2 blocking activity (Figure 3B,

350

C and D). All of these responses were higher than the levels found in plasma from

351

convalescent humans. Together, these observations suggest that RBD-SpyVLP

352

vaccination could potentially elicit protective antibody responses against SARS-CoV-

353

2 in humans.

13, 14, 47

. On the other hand, we showed that high titre neutralising antibody

354
355

RBD-SpyVLP vaccination also induces high titre neutralising antibody responses in

356

pigs (ND50 ~1:11,000) with a dose that we aim to use for subsequent human trials (5

357

µg) (Figure 4D). At a dose around 2-fold less (based on molar ratio), 5 µg of RBD-

358

SpyVLP induced similar neutralisation titres compared to 100 µg of spike glycoprotein,

359

showing the excellent immunogenicity of RBD-SpyVLP vaccination. Transudate RBD-

360

specific IgG from serum can be detected in the oral and nasal cavity (Figure 4E & F).

361

Surprisingly, no increase in antibody titre was observed in pigs that received a higher

362

dose of antigen (50 µg RBD-SpyVLP). There was a trend that the 50 µg RBD-SpyVLP

363

group generated a more rapid and higher response post-prime but the antibody

364

response between the 5 µg and 50 µg RBD-SpyVLP groups were identical post-boost.

365

This suggests a threshold effect.

367

Since RBD-SpyVLPs induce antibody responses that target multiple epitopes on the

368

RBD the chance of selecting neutralisation-escape mutants should be greatly reduced.

369

Circulating SARS-CoV-2 stains are constantly mutating and the likelihood of

370

persistence of the virus in the human population is high 48, 49.

371
372

We observed differences in the levels of ACE2 blocking in sera from immunised mice

373

and pigs (Figure 3C and 4B). Sera taken from mice immunised with RBD-SpyVLP had

374

at least one order of magnitude higher ACE2 blocking activity compared to serum from

375

pigs, despite neutralisation titres being comparable (Figure 3D and 4D). This suggests

376

that mice and pigs may produce distinct antibody responses against the vaccine

377

candidate, although they were equally potent in neutralising live viruses. Surprisingly,

378

ACE2 blocking in both mild and critical/severe convalescent humans who had natural

379

infection were also low compared to the sera from immunised mice (Figure 3D).

380

Nevertheless, the RBD-SpyVLP induces strong neutralising antibody responses in

381

both mice and pigs. The potential for a vaccine based on the RBD is further

382

emphasised by the sterile immunity induced in non-human primates (Macaca mulatta)

383

by two doses of 20 to 40 µg of unconjugated RBD in Al(OH)3 adjuvant

A recently published report on an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate showed

388

that vaccinated non-human primates (NHP) with a serum neutralising titre (ND50) of

389

<1:100 were still protected against wild type SARS-CoV-2 challenge with no weight

390

loss and no detectable lung pathology 51. In our study, RBD-SpyVLP-vaccinated mice

391

and pigs had ND50 at least an order of magnitude higher than 1:100, which would be

392

expected to provide protection. Sera from pigs immunised with RBD-SpyVLP had

393

similar, if not higher, neutralisation titres against wild type SARS-CoV-2 compared to

394

pigs immunised by adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; both vaccines given as 2

395

doses in the same timeframe) 34. A single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 has been shown

396

to be protective against viral pneumonia and lung pathology following SARS-CoV-2

397

challenge (ND50 ~1:20) in NHP but not virus shedding in the nasal cavity

398

seemingly similar ND50 of the RBD-SpyVLP compared to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in

399

pigs suggests that the RBD-SpyVLP will be as protective as the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19

in NHP and most likely in humans if similar neutralisation titres are achieved. A pre-

pigs immunised with RBD-SpyVLP persisted for at least 2 months and remained

the VLP, to provide broader protection against various SARS-CoV-2 strains

RBD-SpyVLP can also be co-displayed with antigens from other pathogens such as

423

the HA and NA from influenza virus. We have recently shown HA and NA to be highly

424

immunogenic in mice after formulation as a SpyVLP 18. This assembly could potentially

425

provide protection against both SARS-Cov-2 and influenza viruses. Testing resilience

426

of the vaccine candidate, we found that RBD-SpyVLP is stable at ambient temperature,

427

resistant to freeze-thaw, and can be lyophilised and reconstituted with minimal loss in

428

activity (Figure 2B-G) or immunogenicity (Figure 3F). This resilience may not only

simplify vaccine distribution worldwide, especially to countries where cold-chain

resources are incomplete, but also reduce the overall vaccine cost by removing cold-

457

picked and cultured in 10 mL starter LB culture (50 µg/mL kanamycin) for 16 h at 37 °C

458

and shaking at 200 rpm. The preculture was diluted 1:100 into 1 L LB (50 µg/mL

470

lysate at 4 °C for 1 h while mixing at 100 rpm. Precipitated particles were pelleted by

471

centrifugation at 30,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. The collected pellet was resuspended

472

into 8 mL TBS pH 8.5 (25 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl). Residual ammonium sulfate

SpyCatcher003-mi3 was concentrated to 4 mg/mL using a Vivaspin 20 100 kDa spin

475

concentrator (Vivaproducts) and centrifuged at 17,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet

any insoluble material. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 µm syringe filter.

477

The purified SpyCatcher003-mi3 was then further purified using size exclusion

chromatography (SEC). In brief, 2.5 mL was loaded into a HiPrep Sephacryl S-400

479

HR 16-600 SEC column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with TBS using an ÄKTA Pure

480

25 system (GE Healthcare). Proteins were separated at 1 mL/min while collecting 1

mL elution factions. The fractions containing the purified particles were identified by

482

SDS-PAGE, pooled, and concentrated using a Vivaspin 20 100 kDa MW cut-off

centrifugal concentrator. Endotoxin was removed from the SpyCatcher003-mi3

484

samples using Triton X-114 phase separation as previously described

SpyTag-RBD was expressed in Expi293F cells using ExpiFectamine293 transfection

harvested between 5 to 7 days post transfection and filtered through a 0.22 µm filter,

filtered supernatants were diluted with one third supernatant volume of TP buffer (25

495

pH 7. Spy&Go resin in same buffer was mixed with the diluted supernatant and

496

incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle agitation. The mixture was poured into an Econo-

497

Pak column (Bio-Rad) and allowed to empty by gravity. The resin was washed with 2

498

in TP buffer adjusted to pH 7.0 at room temperature (RT). One column volume of

507

SpyTag-RBD was around 100 mg/L. The heterogeneity in the SpyTag-RBD band on

508

Samples of the supernatant were mixed with reducing 6× loading dye (0.23 M Tris-

Mouse immunisation and sampling

572

To prepare the RBD-SpyVLP for vaccination at 125 µg/mL (based on SpyTag-RBD

573

concentration), 5 µM SpyTag-RBD was conjugated with 3.33 µM or 5 µM of

574

SpyCatcher003-mi3 in TBS pH 8.0 at 4 °C for 16 h. The reaction was centrifuged for

575

30 min at 17,000 g at 4 °C to remove potential aggregates. RBD-SpyVLP was

576

aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Matching non-conjugated SpyTag-RBD or

577

SpyCatcher003-mi3 VLP were diluted in the same buffers and incubated and

578

centrifuged in the same way. RBD-SpyVLP (125 µg/mL) was diluted to 4 µg/mL (0.1

579

µg dose) or 20 µg/mL (0.5 µg dose) in the same buffer freshly before immunisation.

580

Before IM immunisation, RBD-SpyVLP was mixed 1:1 (25 µL + 25 µL) with AddaVax

581

adjuvant (Invivogen). Mouse experiments were performed according to the UK

582

Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act Project Licence (PBA43A2E4) and approved by

583

the University of Oxford Local Ethical Review Body. Female C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice

584

(~ 5 weeks old at the time of first immunisation) were obtained from BMS Oxford or

585

Envigo. Mice were housed in accordance with the UK Home Office ethical and welfare

586

guidelines and fed on standard chow and water ad libitum. Isoflurane (Abbott) lightly

587

anaesthetised mice were immunised on day 0 and day 14 IM with 50 µL of RBD-

588

SpyVLP at 0.1 µg or 0.5 µg or equivalent dose of unconjugated SpyTag-RBD or

589

SpyCatcher003-mi3 VLP. Sera samples were obtained on day 42 via cardiac puncture

590

of humanely sacrificed mice. The collected whole blood in Microtainer SST tubes (BD)

591

was allowed to clot at RT for 1 h before spinning down at 10,000 g for 5 min. The

592

clarified sera were heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min before storing at -20 °C.

621

washed with PBS and 50 μL of pre-absorbed human sera diluted in a 2-fold dilution

622

series (starting dilution 1 in 5) were added to the cells for 1 h at RT. The same set of

623

sera were added in parallel plates seeded with MDCK-SIAT1 to obtain background

624

binding on MDCK-SIAT1. Plates were washed and 50 μL of a secondary Alexa Fluor

625

647 goat anti-human antibody (Life Technologies A21455) (1:500 in PBS with 0.1%

626

(w/v) BSA) were added for 1 h at RT. Plates were washed and 100 μL of PBS/1%

627

formalin was added. Fluorescence signal was then read on a Clariostar plate reader.

628

Background signal obtained on the parallel MDCK-SIAT1 plates were subtracted. EPT

629

was determined as described above. Convalescent plasma samples were collected

774

100 µL BioFX 450nmStop Reagent (Cambridge Bioscience) was then added and

775

absorbance was determined using a microplate reader. End-point antibody titres

776

(mean of duplicates) were defined as following: the log10 OD was plotted against the

777

log10 sample dilution and a regression analysis of the linear part of this curve allowed

778

calculation of the endpoint titre with an absorbance of twice the mean absorbance of

779

pre-immunised sera. RBD-specific antibody titres in oral and nasal swab fluids were

780

determined by ELISA as detailed above except that the conjugated secondary

781

antibody was replaced with either goat anti-porcine IgG HRP (Bio-Rad Antibodies) at

782

1:20,000 dilution in PBS with 1% (w/v) skimmed milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 or goat

793

h at 37 °C. Media in the wells seeded with Vero E6 was replaced with 100 µL DMEM

794

with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Gibco) and 100 µL of the sera-virus

795

mixture was added into the wells. The plates were incubated for six days at 37 °C.

796

Cytopathic effect (CPE) was monitored on a brightfield microscopy, and by fixation

797

RBD-tetramer staining assay (pig PBMC)

850

A biotinylated form of RBD was generated for B-cell tetramer staining assays. An RBD

851

protein with a C-terminal biotin acceptor peptide (RBD-BAP) was expressed from

852

plasmid pOPINTTGNeo in Expi293 cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

853

Culture supernatants were clarified by centrifugation and purified through a 5 mL

854

HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare), using the ÄKTA Pure chromatography system

855

(Cytiva). Fractions containing RBD-BAP were concentrated and the excess imidazole

856

removed by buffer exchange using an Amicon 10kDa (Merck). RBD-BAP was

857

biotinylated using E. coli biotin ligase (BirA). GST-BirA enzyme was expressed,

858

purified and biotinylated as previously described

859

assembled with 100µM RBD-BAP, 1µM GST-BirA, 5mM magnesium chloride

860

(Ambion), 2mM ATP and 150µM D-Biotin (both Merck) and incubated twice for one

861

hour at 30 °C with additional fresh biotin and GST-BirA added in-between incubations.

862

GST-BirA was removed from the reaction with a GST HiTrap column, as above, and

863

RBD-BAP was purified out by dialysis as above. Biotinylation of RBD-BAP was

864

confirmed by streptavidin band shift assay

865

RBD tetramers were assembled by combining biotinylated RBD with streptavidin-

866

Brilliant Violet 421 or streptavidin-Brilliant Violet 650 (both BioLegend) at a molar ratio

867

of 4:1. Negative control ‘decoy’ tetramers were similarly assembled using biotinylated

RBD IgG ELISpot assay (pig PBMC)

892

Sterile 96-well Multiscreen-HA filter plates with a mixed cellulose membrane

893

(MAHAS4510, Millipore) were coated with 100 μL of 15 μg/mL anti-porcine IgG mAb

894

(clone MT421, Mabtech, 2BScientific) diluted in 0.05M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer

895

pH 9.2 (Merck). Coated plates were incubated for a minimum of 18 h at 4 °C. Plates

896

were then washed with PBS and blocked using cRPMI for at least 1 h at 37 °C, 5%

897

CO2, 95% humidity. Blocking solution was then removed, and PBMC were added at a

898

density of 5 × 105/well for antigen-specific response or at 5 × 104/well for wells

899

assigned to total IgG (positive control). The plates were then incubated for 18 h at

900

37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity. Media was removed and cells were lysed with cold

901

distilled water, followed by three PBS washes as before. To measure total IgG, 50

902

μL/well of biotinylated anti-IgG mAb (clone MT424-biotin, Mabtech) was added at 0.5

903

µg/mL. To assess antigen-specific responses 50 μL/well of biotinylated SARS-CoV-2

904

RBD was added at 2.5μg/mL. As a negative control, 50 μL/well of biotinylated Nipah

905

G protein was added to the relevant wells at 2.5 μg/mL. All antigens were diluted in

906

PBS with 0.5% (v/v) FCS. An additional set of negative control wells were also

907

prepared by adding 50 μL/well PBS with 0.5% (v/v) FCS. Each condition was tested

908

in triplicate. Plates were incubated for 2 h at RT, before washing five times with PBS.

909

Following this, 50 μL/well of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (streptavidin-ALP)

910

enzyme conjugate (Mabtech) (diluted 1:1,000 in PBS with 0.5% (v/v) FCS) was added

911

to each well and plates were incubated for 1 h at RT (protected from light).

912

Streptavidin-ALP was removed, and plates were washed another 5 times with PBS,

913

followed by addition of 50 μL/well BCIP/NBTplus substrate (Mabtech), neat. Plates

914

were left for 30 min, until distinct spots developed. Finally, development was stopped

915

by addition of 150 μL/well of 4 °C distilled water followed by rinsing both the front and

916

back of the plates with copious tap water. Plates were air-dried, before spots were

917

counted using a CTL ImmunoSpot Analyzer (Cellular Technologies).

918
919

Statistical analysis

920

All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software).

921

Statistical differences were analysed using either Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-

922

Figure 4. RBD-SpyVLPs induce persistent and strong neutralising antibody

1194

responses in pigs. Pigs (n=3 in each group) were dosed twice (prime and boost) IM,

1195

a month apart with 5 µg or 50 µg RBD-VLP or 100 µg of spike glycoprotein, all

1196

adjuvanted with AddaVax and sera were harvested at indicated time-points and

1197

analysed in (A) ELISA against RBD, (B) in an ACE2 competition assay, (C) in

1198

pseudovirus neutralisation assay (pVNT), and (D) wild-type virus neutralisation assay

1199

(VNT). Antibody levels in (E) nasal and (F) oral swabs were measured at indicated

1200

time points using RBD ELISA. Data are presented as the group mean ± 1 SEM. Black

1201

arrows indicate when the vaccines were administered. Kruskal-Wallis test was used

1202

to compare data on day 56 in B-E, n.s.= not significant. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 and

1203

***p<0.001 on day 56 data compared to convalescent human plasma determined by

1204

Mann-Whitney U Test. Dotted lines represent the lowest dilutions of sera tested in the

1205

assays.

Figure 5. RBD-SpyVLP immunisation of mice and pigs elicits polyclonal

1216

antibody responses that targets all key epitopes on the RBD. Competition ELISA

1217

of four human mAbs that target three different key epitopes on the RBD with post-

1218

boost BALB/c sera (0.5 µg RBD-SpyVLP) (A). Competition ELISA of four human mAbs

1219

that target three different key footprints on the RBD with post-boost pig sera (5 µg or

1220

50 µg RBD-SpyVLP) compared to preimmune sera (day 0) (B). Each point in A

1221

represents an average of duplicate readings of a serum sample from one animal three

1222

weeks post boost tested at 1:20 dilution. Each point in B represents an average of

1223

quadruplicate readings of a serum sample from one animal on day 42 tested at 1:20

1224

dilution Data are presented as group means ± 1 SD. ** p<0.01, determined by Mann-
