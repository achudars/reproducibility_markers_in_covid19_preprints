Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the
ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Understanding the
influence of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 gene on clinical outcomes and related
factors is critical for treatment and prevention. Here, we analyzed 209,551
high-coverage complete virus sequences and 321 RNA-seq samples to mine the
mutations associated with clinical outcome in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Several
important hotspot variants were found to be associated with severe clinical outcomes.
Q57H variant in ORF3a protein were found to be associated with higher mortality rate,
and was high proportion in severe cases (39.36%) and 501Y.V2 strains (100%) but
poorly proportional to asymptomatic cases (10.04%). T265I could change nsp2
structure and mitochondrial permeability, and evidently higher in severe cases
(20.12%) and 501Y.V2 strains (100%) but lower in asymptomatic cases (1.43%).
Additionally, R203K and G204R could decrease the flexibility and immunogenic
property of N protein with high frequency among severe cases, VUI 202012/01 and
484K.V2 strains. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 genome was more susceptible to
mutation because of the high frequency of nt14408 mutation (which located in RNA
polymerase) and the high expression levels of ADAR and APOBEC in severe clinical
outcomes. In conclusion, several important mutation hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2
genome associated with clinical outcomes was found in our study, and that might
correlate with different SARS-CoV-2 mortality rates.

Introduction
Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 has rapidly spread
worldwide and became a global health emergency. The clinical spectrum of
SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection,
mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia that may result in
respiratory failure and even death, with many patients being hospitalized with
pneumonia[1-3]. According to the World Health Organization, the mortality rate as of
October 2020 is about 2.7%. However, the mortality rate is up to 26% in severe
cases[4]. The ongoing rapid spread of the virus worldwide, coupled with
asymptomatic cases and patients with severe symptoms, raises an important concern
that it may further mutate into more highly transmissible or virulent forms.
Mortality rates can widely vary according to geography, demographics and
healthcare infrastructure[5], as well as according to various host factors, including
advanced age, being male, and comorbidities[6, 7]. However, the viral factors
underlying the severity of COVID-19 disease and the corresponding mortality rate
remain unclear. Some mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome can reportedly
remarkably change the virus’ properties, such as transmission modes and rates, as well
as the ability to cause diseases[8-10]. The G614D variant in the S glycoprotein is
associated with increased transmissibility, infectivity, and viral loads but not with
disease severity[9, 11]. Parinita et al[12] suggested that the presence of P25L in
ORF3a is a probable mechanism of immune evasion and likely contributes to
enhanced virulence, which are associated with higher mortality rates in SARS-CoV-2
infection. Similarly, some mutations, such as S197L, S194L, and a 382-nucleotide
deletion, are associated with clinical outcomes[13, 14]. Additionally, mutation types,
such as the G/T variant in the open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) gene, is associated
with clinical infections[15].

Therefore, RNA virus mutations not only contributes to viral adaptation that
creates a balance between the integrity of genetic information and genome
variability[16-18] but also lead to different clinical outcomes. Understanding the
characteristics of viral mutations is essential for the pathogenesis, immune escape,
drug resistance, vaccine design, antiviral therapy, and diagnosis of COVID-19. In this
context, we focused on SARS-CoV-2 mutations associated with clinical outcomes.
First, 209,551 high-coverage complete virus sequences from the GISAID database
were compared with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512.2). This study
aimed to gain important insights into virus mutations and their occurrence over time,
especially hotspot mutations associated with different clinical outcomes. Second,
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and RNA-editing enzyme analyzed from
321 RNA-seq samples were explored to explore the SARS-CoV-2 mutations that are
associated with different clinical outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data source
Publicly available SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes of different patients were
collected from the GISAID virus repository (https://www.gisaid.org/) from January 1,
2020 to January 1, 2021. Viral sequences with a complete genome (28000–30,000 bps)
were included in this study. Moreover, the viral genomic sequences of MERS and
SARS were downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI;
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih). RNA-seq datasets available from the PRJNA601736 (2
sample, Raw sequence reads), PRJNA603194 (1 sample, Raw sequence reads),
PRJNA605907 (8 sample, Raw sequence reads), PRJNA631753 (62 sample, Raw
sequence reads), PRJNA639791 (6 sample, Raw sequence reads), PRJNA656568 (93
SARS-CoV-2

infection,

Transcriptome or Gene expression) and PRJNA683226 (37 mild samples, 10
moderate samples, 3 severe samples, Transcriptome or Gene expression) projects
were also downloaded from the NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/).

Single nucleotide variation (SNV) calling in genomic sequence
SNVs were called with a custom R script, by comparing the viral genome sequences
to the reference sequence. The reference of SARS-CoV-2 is NC_045512.2 sequence,
that of SARS is NC_004718.3 sequence, and that of MERS is NC_019843.3 sequence.
SNVs occurring on coding sequences were annotated with custom R scripts to
determine the outcome of nucleotide changes, including nonsense, nonsynonymous,
and synonymous mutations.
SNV calling in the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2
REDItools 2[19, 20] and JACUSA[21] were used together to call the SNVs in the
transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2. With REDItools 2, all SNVs within 15 nucleotides
from the beginning or the end of the reads were removed to avoid artifacts due to
misalignments. Furthermore, the AS_StrandOddsRatio parameter was utilized to
avoid potential artifacts due to strand bias, and any mutation with an
AS_StrandOddsRatio of > 4 was removed from the dataset. The overlap of mutations
generated by REDItools 2 and JACUSA were considered. The threshold to filter the
SNVs was based on minimum coverage (20 reads), number of supporting reads (at
least four mutated reads), allelic fraction (0.5%), quality of the mapped reads (>25),
and base quality (>35).
Gene expression in transcriptome
Gene expression in transcriptome was analyzed by introducing transcript per million
(TPM) to estimate gene expression levels. Given that TPM considers the effects of
sequencing depth, gene length, and sample on reads count, it is often used to estimate
gene expression levels. In this study, all samples were processed through a
SARS-CoV-2

reference-based

assembly

pipeline

that

involved

removing

non-SARS-CoV-2 reads with Kraken2[22] and aligning to the SARS-CoV-2 reference
genome NC_045512.2 by using Samtools[23]. SARS-CoV-2 TPM was calculated
using the R package tximport[24] via the length Scaled TPM method.

Statistical analysis
The normality of data distribution was checked via Shapir–Wilk test. Categorical
variables were expressed as absolute frequency and percentages. The different of SNV
counts per genome between different clinic outcome was analyzed using one-way
ANOVA followed by Student Newman–Keuls test, and Chi-square was utilized to
compare the frequency of mutation sites between different clinical outcomes. Wald
test and log2 FDR were used to compare the number of gene expression between
different groups. Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to estimate the
correlation between sample gene expression and viral load. A higher Pearson
correlation coefficient indicated a stronger correlation. All p-values were calculated
from two-sided tests using 0.05 as the significance level.
Results
Characterization of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome
A total of 209,551 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences isolated from patients
were download from the GISAID Database. All sequences were aligned and
compared with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512.2). Results showed
that C>T, G>T, A>G and G>A mutations were the main SNV types (Figure 1A), and
the frequency of these SNV types increased, especially the C>T mutation from
January 2020 to January 2021 (Figure 1B). The effects of clade, region, sex, and age
on base mutations were also analyzed, indicating that clade and region were also the
main factors of mutation. For example, GV was more prone to C>T mutations, while
GR was more prone to A>G, G>A and G>T mutations. Furthermore, Europe and
Africa were more prone to all base mutations than the other regions (Figure S1). The
sequence context of mutation showed special preference, the C>T mutation
preferentially targets a 5-TTCTA-3  motif, the A>G mutation preferentially targets

a 5-GGATG-3 motif, and the G>A mutation preferentially targets a 5

-AAGGG-3  motif (Figure S2).

A total of 1,329 high-quality sequences had special clinical information.
According to clinical description, these sequences were divided into three groups:
asymptomatic, mild/moderate, and severe/ICU/deceased. The mutation frequency of
C>T, A>G, and G>A was substantially higher in severe cases than in asymptomatic
cases, whereas that of G>T was higher in asymptomatic case than that in other groups
(Figure 1C). These mutations were concentrated in the ORF1ab, S, N genes (Figure
1D). The count of SNV per genome was divided into six groups: asymptomatic cases
were mainly distributed in 1–5 (32%) and 6–10 (19.1%), mild/moderate cases were
largely distributed in 1–5 (22.3%) and 6–10 (49.4%), and severe cases were chiefly
distributed in 6–10 (62.2%) and 11–15 (25.8%). The difference in the three clinical
outcomes was statistically significant (p<0.000) (Figure 1E). The mutation results of
asymptomatic, mild/moderate, and severe cases were primarily nonsynonymous (54%,
46.5%, and 48.3%, respectively), followed by synonymous (37%, 41.1%, and 38.7%,
respectively) (Figure 1F). The sequence context of mutation showed that the motif
preference for the three clinical outcomes was similar (Figure S3).

According to the results of the Chi-square test, 130 missense mutation sites were
notably different in the three clinical outcomes (Table S1). These missense mutations
were primarily distributed in ORF1ab (56.98%), S (16.28%), ORF3a (11.63%), and N
(10.47%) (Figure 2A). With regard to the mutations that presented in over 5% of the
samples, six missense mutations were present in asymptomatic cases only, including
K4576N and N5542D in ORF1ab, A222V and S477N in S, A376T in N, and V30L in
ORF10. Additionally, L3930F in ORF1ab and V1176F in S were found in severe
symptom cases only (Figure 2B). Six major missense mutations were obviously
higher in symptomatic cases than in asymptomatic cases: T265I in ORF1ab
(asymptomatic:1%,

symptomatic:15%),

D614G

in

S

(asymptomatic:59%,

symptomatic:91%), Q57H in ORF3a (asymptomatic:10%, symptomatic:29%), R203K
in N (asymptomatic:27%, symptomatic:40.4%), and G204R in N (asymptomatic:25%,
symptomatic:40.4%) (Figure 2C).
The mutations were found to be related to clades. Thus, the distribution of
mutation hotspots among the clades were analyzed. In this study, 25 major missense
mutation hotspots (frequency >5% in at least one of clade) were included in the
analysis of distribution in different clades. For these mutations, 18 mutation hotspots
were higher in the asymptomatic cases than in symptomatic cases: P80S, M3087I,
K4576N, X5167Y, N5542D, S5585I, S477N, M220V, A376T, M234I, and A376T
were predominantly distributed in GH clade; R6997P, A222V, A220V, and V30L were
mainly distributed in GV clade; T2016K, L3606F, and P13L were mostly distributed
in O clade. However, seven mutation hotspots were higher in the symptomatic cases
than in asymptomatic cases; L3930F V1176F, R203K, and G204R were chiefly
distributed in GR clade; T265I and Q57H were mostly distributed in GH clade
(Figure 2E). The issue of whether these mutation hotspots were also distributed in the
three major pandemic strains, namely, SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 strains
circulating in the United Kingdom, 501Y.V2 strains spreading in South Africa, and
484K.V2 strains dispersing in Brazil, was also analyzed: P681R and L15F were found
to be distributed in the SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 strains. S171L and I121L were

observed to be distributed in the 501Y.V2 strains. T265I and Q57H were determined
to be distributed in 501Y.V2 strains. L3930F and V1176F were uncovered to be
distributed in 484K.V2 strains. R203K and G204R were discovered to be distributed
in the SARS-CoV-2 VUI202012/01strains and 484K.V2 strains. D614G was
established to be distributed in the three strains (Figure 2F).

Dynamics distribution of clinical outcome-associated mutations over time
The dynamics distribution of the 25 major mutation hotspots over time was further
analyzed. A222V, A220V, R6997P, and V30L co-occurred and rapidly increased
starting from July 2020. M3087I, X5167Y, K4576N, N5542D, A376T, and S5585I
co-occurred and gradually increased. S477N started to rise in June but decreased
again in July (Figures 3A and 3B). D614G increased from 74.6% to 99.9%. T265I,
Q57H, R203K, and G204R started to increase in March and gradually decreased in
July. However, all the mutations associated with symptomatic cases increased starting
from November 2020 (Figures 3C and 3D).

The issue of whether the mutation of RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) was
associated with SARS-CoV-2 mutations was analyzed. Results showed that 142
mutations occurred in the RdRp. Moreover, the incidence rate of nt14408 mutation,
which was distributed in asymptomatic cases (56.5%), mild/moderate cases (91.2%),
and severe/ICU/deceased cases (95.9%), was the highest (Figure 4A). The 209,551
sequences were divided into “with nt 14408 mutation” and “without nt14408 mutation”
groups, and the SNV count was calculated and divided into six ranges. According to
the results of Chi-square test, 1–5 (p<0.000), 6–10 (p<0.000), 11–15 (p<0.000), 16–20
(p<0.000), and 21–25 (p=0.03) were significantly difference between “with nt 14408
mutation” and “without nt14408 mutation” groups, the “without nt14408 mutation”
group was primarily distributed in 1–5, whereas the “with nt 14408 mutation” group
was mostly distributed 6–10 and 11–15 (Figure 4B). The SNV type affected by
nt14408 mutation was also analyzed. The counts of A>G, C>T, G>A, G>C and G>T
in the “with nt14408 mutation” group were higher than those in the “without nt14408
mutation” group (Figure 4C).

the RNA editing in the body. These samples included lung tissues (Figure 5A),
nasopharyngeal swabs (Figure 5C), and human alveolar type II cell organoids (Figure
5E). Finally, 19 lung tissue samples, 7 swab samples and 3 human alveolar type II cell
organoids samples were qualified for further analysis. In each group, the distribution
of all SNV types was different. C>T and G>T mutations were the major SNV types in
lung tissues (Figure 5B), while A>G and T>C SNVs were the main SNV types in
nasopharyngeal swabs (Figure 5 D), and A>G and C>T SNVs were the primary SNV
types in human alveolar type II cell organoids (Figure 5F). The SNV types in every
individual were also analyzed. The SNV types were different (Figure S5), which were
pooled together (Figures 5, A, 5C and 5E).

Expression of the RNA-editing enzyme in the transcriptome
In this study, PRJNA656568, PRJNA631753 and PRJNA683226 were used to analyze
the expression of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA proteins (including ADAR1,
ADARB1, and ADARB2), apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like
proteins (including APOBEC1, APOBEC2, APOBEC3A, APOBEC3B, APOBEC3C,
APOBEC3D, APOBEC3F, APOBEC3G, APOBEC3H, and APOBEC4), recombinant
reactive oxygen species modulator 1 (ROMO1), and negative regulator of reactive
oxygen species (NRROS). APOBEC1, APOBEC3H gene were lack in the
PRJNA656568. In the PRJNA656568, the expression levels of ADAR1, APOBEC3C,
APOBEC3D, APOBEC3F, APOBEC3G, and APOBEC4 were higher among
SARS-CoV-2 infection than in those not infected by the virus (Figures 6A–6C). In the
PRJNA683226, the expression levels of ADARB1, APOBEC1, and APOBEC3H were
higher among severe cases than moderate cases. The expression levels of ADARB1
and ADARB2 were higher among severe cases than moderate cases (Figure 6D-F).
Further analysis revealed that the expression of APOBEC3A (r = 0.32) was positively

levels of ADARB2 (r = –0.29), APOBEC2 (r = –0.35), APOBEC4 (r = –0.28), and
ROMO1 (r = –0.34) were negatively correlated with the virus load of SARS-CoV-2
(Figures 6H-6K). In the PRJNA631753, these was no significantly difference between
SARS-CoV-2 infection and control in the lung (Figures S7A- S7C). The expression
levels of ADAR1, ADARB1, APOBEC3C, APOBEC3D, and APOBEC3G were
higher in the lung tissues than those in the heart and liver tissues (Figures S5D- S5F).

Discussion

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.31.437666; this version posted March 31, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

Thousands of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have been identified. Some of these
mutations have become largely fixed in more recent, geographically defined viral
populations[8, 25, 26]. Thus, these mutations might be the underlying factors of
different clinical outcomes, and they may affect the efficacy of antiviral therapies.
Mutations in viral genes may have a direct correlation to clinical outcomes[13].
However, the reason these mutations cause different clinical outcomes remains
unknown, a gap in research that requires further analysis. In this study, we identified
mutation hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 sequence associated with clinical outcomes,
clades, and regions. We found that the expression levels of D614G, L3930F, V1176F,
R203K, G204R, T265I, and Q57H, which were found to be highly distributed in the
SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01, 501Y.V2, and 484K.V2 strains, were higher in severe
cases than in asymptomatic cases. Moreover, we found that the frequency of nt14408
mutation, which was found in the RdRp gene and was observed to increase the
susceptibility to mutations, was higher in severe cases than in asymptomatic cases.
Furthermore, we established that the mutation of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with
the expression of ADAR and APOBEC.
We identified some mutation hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that were
associated with severe outcomes. The frequency of nt14408 mutation, which was in
RdRp (also named nsp12), was higher in severe cases (95.90%) than in asymptomatic

，

cases (56.46%). Notably the “with nt14408 mutation” group had higher mutation
counts than the “without nt14408 mutation” group, especially for the C > T, A > G, G >
A, and G > T mutations. However, the mechanism by which nt14408 mutation affects
genomic mutation remains unclear. The RdRp is a multi-domain protein that can
catalyze the RNA–template dependent formation of phosphodiester bonds between
ribonucleotides in the presence of divalent metal ions[27, 28]. In most viruses, RNA
polymerase lacks proof-reading capability, with some exceptions such as Nidovirales
order (to which the Coronavirus genus belongs), which stands out for having the
largest RNA genome. The SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is a key component of the
replication/transcription machinery. SARS-CoV-2 shares a higher homology for nsp12

compared with SARS-CoV, suggesting that its function and mechanism of action
might be well conserved[29]. Maria Pachetti et al.[30] suggested that the RdRp
variant is possibly associated with SARS-CoV-2 mutations. In the present work, the
nt14408 mutation in RdRp was found to be more susceptible to mutations, especially
for severe outcomes. We speculate that nt14408 mutation may reduce proof-reading
capability and make the SARS-CoV-2 genome more susceptible to mutations.
The Q57H variant, which was found to occur in the ORF3a protein, had a higher
frequency in severe cases (39.36%) than in asymptomatic cases (10.04%). An
RNA-seq dataset (PRJNA631753) from the lungs of deceased patients were also
analyzed. Results showed that 85.71% (6/7) of these patients had the Q57H variant. A
previous study reported that the Q57H variant can cause dramatic changes in protein
structures and decrease the flexibility of domains, thereby enhancing the binding
affinities in ORF3a-M and ORF3a-S complexes[31]. Thus, the Q57H variant may
destroy drug-targeting sites and lead to therapy failure by shifting the protein-binding
interface. Other studies demonstrated that the ORF3a protein can induce apoptosis in
cells[32], similar to SARS-CoV [33, 34]. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has a
relatively weaker pro-apoptotic activity than SARS-CoV ORF3a. This property of
SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a confers certain advantages: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be
relatively mild or even asymptomatic during the early stages, thus allowing the virus
to spread more widely. Majumdar et al.[12] reported that the ORF3a mutation is
associated with a higher mortality rate in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, further
researche on these mutations is warranted to determine whether these structural
alterations in ORF3a influence protein functions and even virus infectivity.
Some of the mutation hotspots identified herein, namely, T265I, D614G, R203K,
G204R, L3930F, and V1176F, were found to be associated with severe outcomes with
high frequency worldwide. T265I, which is located in non-structural protein 2 (nsp2),
has been observed in 13.83% of all cases worldwide. nsp2 is an important domain that
ensures the functional integrity of the mitochondria and responds to cellular stress[35].

A change from a polar amino acid (threonine) to a non-polar one (isoleucine) can
render nsp2 hydrophobic, thereby inducing structural alterations in that domain[36].
Hence, T265I mutation can change nsp2 structure and mitochondrial permeability,
thereby inducing apoptosis pathways. The D614G variant, which was found to occurr
in the S protein, has been proved to enhance infection and transmission[9, 11]. The
R203K and G204R variants co-occurs in the N protein and cause dramatic changes in
protein structure

(RMSD

≥

5.0 Å), thus decreasing the flexibility of the

domain[31]. The N protein has a high immunogenic property that enables it to elicit a
protective immune response against SARS-CoV-2[37, 38]. R203K and G204R
mutations could change N protein structures and affect viral replication, pathogenicity,
and disease severity. More importantly, all of these mutation hotspots were also found
in the three highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants (i.e., B.1.1.7/VUI202012/01,
B.1.351/501Y.V2, and B.1.1.28/484K.V2). These new variants with additional
mutation are rapidly spreading in the United Kingdom (VUI 202012/01), South Africa
(501Y.V2), and Brazil (484K.V2). These mutation hotspots may be associated with
the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the resulting mortality. We focus on these mutation
hotspots to prevent them from causing the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic again.
Furthermore, we found some mutation hotspots associated with asymptomatic
cases. For example, the L3606F mutation in non-structural protein 6 (nsp6) was
significantly higher in asymptomatic cases (40.19%) than in symptomatic cases
(3.39%). nsp6 mutation could affect viral autophagy[39], a critical host antiviral
defense. The issue of whether L3606F mutation can weaken the autophagy function
of nsp6 requires further study. Notably, these major mutations in asymptomatic cases
mostly co-occurred and were distributed in different genes. For example, R6997P
(ORF1Ab), A222V (S), A220V (N), and V30L (ORF10) co-occurred in 0.5% of all
cases in July 2020 and exceeded 50% of all cases by January 2021 worldwide.
M3087I (ORF1Ab), K4576N (ORF1Ab), X5167Y (ORF1Ab), N5542D (ORF1Ab),
S5585I (ORF1Ab), and A376T (N) co-occurred in 0.8% of all cases in January 2020
to 5.7% of known cases in January 2021 worldwide. Thus, the mutation is a

cumulative process. This significant result indicated that co-occurring mutations are
an important factor for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These mutations may be relevant
in designing vaccines.
The factors that caused these different mutations are unclear. The process of viral
genome mutagenesis includes host-dependent RNA editing enzymes, RdRp,
spontaneous nucleic acid damages due to physical and chemical mutagens and
recombination events. The host-dependent RNA editing enzymes includes ADAR,
APOBEC, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (regulated by ROMO1 and NRROS). A
previous study offered a possible evidence for host-dependent RNA editing in the
transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2[40]. Here, we analyzed varous SNV types and host
editing enzymes. The SNV types were dominated by C>T, A>G, and G>T. The C>T
substitution is a signature likely related to APOBEC activity. The A>G substitution is
probably related to ADAR activity. The G>T substitution is possibly related to
ROS-related processes. The expression levels of ADAR1, APOBEC3C, APOBEC3D,
APOBEC3F, APOBEC3G, and APOBEC4 increased after SARS-CoV-2 infection,
indicating that ADARs and APOBECs are involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. ADAR,
which can convert A-to-I, has three ADAR genes encoded in the human genome[41].
APOBEC, a family of zinc-dependent deaminases, includes APOBEC1, APOBEC2,
AID, APOBEC3 (with family members A, B, C, D, F, G, and H), and APOBEC4[42].
Most APOBECs have been shown to catalyze cytosine deamination to uracil (C-to-U)
of foreign single-stranded DNA and RNA[43]. We found that clinical outcomes could
affect the expression of ADAR and APOBEC, a process that is probably the main
cause of different mutation rates among clinical outcomes. Notably, the expression
levels of ADAR3, APOBEC2, APOBEC4, and ROMO1 were negatively correlated
with the virus load of SARS-CoV-2, indicating that these deaminases may be related
to antivirus.
However, this research has several limitations. First, the insufficient clinical
information on these sequences may have led to missing some mutations associated

with clinical outcomes. Second, given that some raw RNA-seq data were unavailable,
the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 mutation and clinical outcomes at the patient
level was not analyzed. Third, some hotspot mutations lacked experimental proof and
thus require experimental verification.
Conclusion
By analyzing 209,551 high-coverage complete virus sequences and 352 RNA-seq
samples, we found that several hotspot variants, especially Q57H, T265I, D614G,
R203K, and G204R mutations, were associated with severe outcomes. These
mutations were higher in severe cases than in asymptomatic cases and were highly
distributed in the SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01, 501Y.V2, and B.1.1.248 strains. The
nt14408 mutation located in RdRp was accompanied with greater susceptibility to
mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We also found that the main SNV types of
SARS-CoV-2 were C>T, A >G, and G >T, all of which were associated with the
expression levels of ADARS and APOBEC. Our results indicated that these variants
must be further investigated. This study provides insights into the development of
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.
