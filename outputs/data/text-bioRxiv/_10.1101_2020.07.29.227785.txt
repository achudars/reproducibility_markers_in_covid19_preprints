ABSTRACT
The densely glycosylated spike (S) proteins that are highly exposed on the surface of
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) facilitate viral
attachment, entry, and membrane fusion. We have previously reported all the 22
N-glycosites and site-specific N-glycans in the S protein protomer. Herein, we report
the comprehensive

and precise

site-specific O-glycosylation

landscapes of

SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, which were characterized using high-resolution mass
spectrometry.

Following

digestion

using

trypsin

and

trypsin/Glu-C,

and

de-N-glycosylation using PNGase F, we determined the mucin-type (GalNAc-type)
O-glycosylation pattern of S proteins, including unambiguous O-glycosites and the 6
most common O-glycans occupying them, via Byonic identification and manual
validation. Finally, 43 O-glycosites were identified in the insect cell-expressed S
protein. Most glycosites were modified by non-sialylated O-glycans such as
HexNAc(1) and HexNAc(1)Hex(1). In contrast, 30 O-glycosites were identified in the
human cell-expressed S protein S1 subunit. Most glycosites were modified by
sialylated

O-glycans

such

as

HexNAc(1)Hex(1)NeuAc(1)

and

HexNAc(1)Hex(1)NeuAc(2). Our results are the first to reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein is a mucin-type glycoprotein; clustered O-glycans often occur in the N- and the
C-termini of the S protein, and the O-glycosite and O-glycan compositions vary with
the host cell type. These site-specific O-glycosylation landscapes of the SARS-CoV-2
S protein are expected to provide novel insights into the viral binding mechanism and
present a strategy for the development of vaccines and targeted drugs.

1. INTRODUCTION
The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) is an extensively N-glycosylated protein1 that protrudes from the virus
surface and binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on host
cells to mediate cell entry2. All 22 N-glycosites and N-glycans attached to asparagine
(Asp, N) in a recombinant S protein protomer expressed in human and insect cells
have been identified using high-resolution liquid chromatography–tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)3. These N-glycosites are preferentially distributed in two
functional subunits responsible for receptor binding (S1 subunit) and membrane
fusion (S2 subunit)3. Site-specific N-glycosylation analysis can provide valuable
insights into the infection mechanism and present a strategy for the development of
vaccines4.
Unlike N-glycosylation, mucin-type O-glycosylation is initiated by the

α-glycosidic attachment of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to the hydroxyl group of
serine (Ser, S) or threonine (Thr, T), which contains eight types of core structures
(Core-1 to Core-8 O-glycans), and is involved in a variety of biological functions,
such as the mediation of pathogenic binding to human receptors4,5. Moreover,
O-glycosylation can influence proteolysis during antigen processing, which could
prevent the formation of glycopeptides for further presentation to major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) and the elicitation of immune response6. The S
protein O-glycosites of SARS-CoV-2 have been predicted using computational
analysis7, and Shajahan et al. (2020) identified two O-glycosites (T323 and S325)
using LC-MS/MS8. However, mucin-type O-glycosylation often occurs in a cluster9.
Hence, we believe that there are many mucin-type O-glycosites that have not been
discovered as deciphering protein O-glycosylation remains a big challenge. The

comprehensive and precise site-specific O-glycosylation analysis cannot be performed
without appropriate sample preprocessing, analysis methods, and software10-15.
In the present study, we characterized the site-specific O-glycosylation of
recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S proteins expressed in human and insect cells, using
LC-MS/MS. Based on a complementary enzyme digestion strategy, we identified
large-scale O-glycosites and their corresponding O-glycans in the recombinant S
proteins, by extensive manual interpretation. The glycosite-specific occupancy by
different glycoforms of S protein S1 subunits expressed in human and insect cells was
resolved and compared. Detailed O-glycosylation profiles of S proteins are
complementary to the N-glycosylation profiles and may help in the development of
vaccines and therapeutic drugs.

2.2. Protein digestion
Recombinant S proteins were proteolyzed using an in-solution protease digestion protocol. In
brief, 50 μg of protein in a tube was denatured for 10 min at 95 °C. After reduction by DTT
(20 mM) for 45 min at 56 °C and alkylation with IAA (50 mM) for 1 h at 25 °C in the dark, 2

μg of protease (trypsin or trypsin/Glu-C) was added to the tube and incubated for 16 h at
37 °C. After desalting using a pipette tip packed with a C18 membrane, the peptide
concentration was determined using a peptide assay kit, based on the absorbance measured at
480 nm. The peptide mixtures were freeze-dried for further analysis.
2.3. Enrichment of intact glycopeptides and N-glycan removal
Intact N- and O-glycopeptides were enriched with ZIC-HILIC materials. Specifically, 20 μg
of peptides was suspended in 100 μL of 80% ACN/0.2% TFA solution, and 2 mg of processed
ZIC-HILIC materials was added to the peptide solution and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Finally,
the mixture was transferred to a 200 μL pipette tip packed with a C8 membrane, and washed
twice with 80% ACN/0.2% TFA. After enrichment, intact glycopeptides were eluted thrice
with 70 μL of 0.1% TFA, and dried using a SpeedVac concentrator. The enriched intact
glycopeptides were digested using 1 U PNGase F dissolved in 50 μL of 50 mM NH4HCO3 for
2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.1% FA. The de-N-glycopeptides and
O-glycopeptides were dried using a SpeedVac concentrator for further analysis.
2.4. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis
All the samples were analyzed using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) in mass
spectrometry (Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer). In brief, intact O-glycopeptides
and de-N-glycopeptides were dissolved in 0.1% FA and separated on a column (ReproSil-Pur
C18-AQ, 1.9 μm, 75 μm inner diameter, 20 cm length; Dr Maisch) over a 78 min gradient
(buffer A, 0.1% FA in water; buffer B, 0.1% FA in 80% ACN) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min.
MS1 was analyzed with a scan range (m/z) of 350–1550 at an Orbitrap resolution of 120,000.
The RF lens, AGC target, maximum injection time, and exclusion duration were 30%, 1.0e6,

50 ms, and 15 s, respectively. MS2 was analyzed with an isolation window (m/z) of 2 at an
Orbitrap resolution of 15,000. The AGC target, maximum injection time, and HCD type were
5.0e4, 80 ms, and 35%, respectively.
2.5. Data analysis
Raw data files were searched against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequence using Byonic™
software (version 3.6.0, Protein Metrics, Inc.)16, with the mass tolerance for precursors and
fragment ions set at ±10 and ±20 ppm, respectively. Two missed cleavage sites were subjected
to trypsin or trypsin/Glu-C digestion. The fixed modification was carbamidomethyl (C), and
the variable modifications included oxidation (M), acetyl (protein N-term), and de-amidation
(N). In addition, the 6 most common mucin-type O-glycans (HexNAc(1) with mass of
203.079 Da; HexNAc(2) with mass of 406.159 Da; HexNAc(1)Hex(1) with mass of 365.132
Da; HexNAc(2)Hex(1) with mass of 568.212 Da; HexNAc(1)Hex(1)NeuAc(1) with mass of
656.228 Da; and HexNAc(1)Hex(1)NeuAc(2) with mass of 947.323 Da) were specified as
O-glycan modifications for intact O-glycopeptides. We then checked the protein database
options, including the decoy database. All other parameters were set to the default values, and
protein groups were filtered using a 1% false discovery rate, based on the number of hits
obtained for the searches against the databases. Stricter quality control methods for intact
O-glycopeptide identification were implemented; they required a score of not less than 300,
and at least 6 amino acids to be identified. Furthermore, all the glycopeptide-spectrum
matches (GPSMs) were examined manually and filtered using the following standard criteria:
a. GPSMs were accepted if there were at least two glycan oxonium ions and at least 6 b/y ions
in the peptide backbone. b. The unambiguously identified O-glycosites were not to be
hindered by the surrounding potential O-glycosites (Ser or Thr). In addition, the
high-confidence O-glycosites had to be identified repeatedly at least twice. O-glycosite
conservation analysis was performed using R software packages. Model building based on the
Cryo-EM structure (PDB: 6VSB) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was performed using
PyMOL.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Strategy for intact O-glycopeptide analysis

Our previous study revealed site-specific N-glycosylation of recombinant S proteins3.
However, comprehensive and precise site-specific O-glycosylation analysis of the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein has not been performed. In the present study, we aimed to
characterize the site-specific mucin-type O-glycosylation landscapes of SARS-CoV-2
recombinant S proteins.
The strategy for intact O-glycopeptide analysis is shown in Figure 1A. The
recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S proteins were digested using trypsin or a mixture of
trypsin and Glu-C to cover as many potential O-glycosites as possible. Then, intact
glycopeptides were enriched using ZIC-HILIC17, and de-N-glycosylated with PNGase
F to avoid interference from non-glycopeptides and N-glycopeptides. Finally, intact
O-glycopeptides were analyzed using a high-resolution mass spectrometer, and their
mass spectra were characterized using Byonic™ and validated manually18. The S
protein expressed in insect cells contained 1209 amino acids (residues 16–1,213) and
included 94 Thr and 92 Ser residues as potential mucin-type O-glycosites. The spike
protein S1 subunit expressed in human cells contained 681 amino acids (residues
16–685) and included 57 Thr and 50 Ser residues as potential mucin-type
O-glycosites (Figure S1). Combined digestion can cover more potential sites,
including the reported and predicted O-glycosites19. As shown in Figure 1B, there was
strong mass spectra evidence for the presence of O-glycosylation at site Thr323, as
reported recently8. The representative HCD-MS/MS spectra of intact O-glycopeptide
320

VQPTESIVR328 with GalNAcGal on site Thr323 (Figure 1B) indicated sufficient

fragment ions (b ions, y ions, and oxonium ions) to confirm the presence of
O-glycosylation on the target site of the peptide. In addition, the experimental data

and manual interpretation showed that intact O-glycopeptide 320VQPTESIVR328 could
be O-glycosylated on a single site, i.e., Ser325 (Figure 1C), or both sites, i.e., Thr323
and Ser325 (Figure 1D). These results showed that our strategy was feasible for
mucin-type O-glycosylation profiling.
3.2. Site-specific O-glycosylation profiling of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein
expressed in insect cells
The S protein produced by the baculovirus insect cell expression system contained
186 potential N-glycosites. Using our aforementioned strategy, a total of 43
O-glycosites were assigned unambiguously with high-quality spectral evidence (Table
S1 and Figure S2). Forty O-glycosites, except S477, T572, and T732 could be
identified repeatedly using trypsin alone. Moreover, 40 O-glycosites, except S325,
T333, and T1066, could be identified repeatedly using trypsin combined with Glu-C
(Figure 2A). Hence, although trypsin digestion can yield good identification results,
trypsin combined with Glu-C digestion should be considered as complementary step.
Furthermore, we mapped these high-confidence O-glycosites to the amino sequences,
and found that the O-glycosites clustered in several areas, especially in the N- and
C-termini of the S protein (Figure 2B). It is notable that the O-glycosites T323, S325,
T333, S345, and S477 were located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). This was
the first result to reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a mucin-type glycoprotein.
In addition, the number of O-glycosylated Thr residues (25) was higher than that of
O-glycosylated Ser residues (18) (Figure 2B). This result is consistent with those of
previous studies on O-glycoproteomics18. Finally, a global analysis of site-specific
O-glycosylation of the S protein was performed (Figure 2C). Six mucin-type
O-glycan compositions were identified on these sites, including HexNAc(1),
HexNAc(2), HexNAc(1)Hex(1), HexNAc(2)Hex(1), HexNAc(1)Hex(1)NeuAc(1),

HexNAc(2)Hex(1),

HexNAc(1)Hex(1)NeuAc(1),

HexNAc(2),

and

HexNAc(1)Hex(1)NeuAc(2) compositions corresponded to 40, 30, 21, 18, 11, and 7
glycosites, respectively. Most glycosites contained at least two types of O-glycans, a
majority of which were non-sialylated (Figure 2C). These results indicated the
clustered mucin-type O-glycans on the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein expressed
in insect cells.
3.3. Site-specific O-glycosylation profiling of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein
expressed in human cells
The recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein S1 subunit produced by the human cell
expression system was used for analysis of the site-specific O-glycans, as the
O-glycan compositions in insect cells could be different from those in human cells.

for O-glycosite identification. Furthermore, we mapped these 30 O-glycosites to the
amino sequences. We found that the O-glycosites mainly clustered at the N- and
C-termini of the S1 subunit and RBD (Figures 3B and 3C). It is notable that two
conserved O-glycosites, T323 and S325, were located in the RBD of the S1 subunit,

25, 24, 16, 10, and 9 glycosites, respectively. Most glycosites contained at least two
types of O-glycans, a majority of which were sialylated (Figure 3D). These results
indicated the more complex mucin-type O-glycosylation and the heterogeneity of
O-glycan compositions on the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein expressed in
human cells.
3.4. Comparison of O-glycosylation landscapes of S1 subunits expressed in insect
and human cells
Based on the above findings, we further compared the O-glycosylation landscapes of
the S1 subunits expressed in insect and human cells. Twenty-three O-glycosites were
present in the S1 subunit expressed in insect cells (Figure 4A). In contrast, 30
O-glycosites were present in the S1 subunit expressed in human cells (Figure 4B). In
addition, 16 conserved O-glycosites (T22, T29, S31, T124, T284, T286, S297, T299,
T323, S325, T572, T573, S659, S673, T676, and T678) were identified in the S1
subunits expressed in insect and human cells, including two sites, T323 and S325,
located in the RBD. Seven and fourteen unique O-glycosites were identified in the
insect and human cell–produced S1 subunits, respectively (Figure 4C). Furthermore,
the number of S1 subunit O-glycosites occupied by each type of O-glycan
compositions was very different. Most O-glycosites of the insect cell–produced S1
subunit contained HexNAc(1)Hex(1) and HexNAc(1). On the other hand, most

varied with the host cell type, which could be taken into account when using the

4. CONCLUSIONS

In this study, we profiled a comprehensive site-specific O-glycosylation pattern of
SARS-CoV-2 S proteins using optimized experimental procedure and high resolution
mass spectrometry. Forty-three O-glycosites were identified in insect cell–expressed S
protein, and most of them were non-sialylated. In contrast, 30 O-glycosites were
identified in human S protein, and most of them were sialylated. Our results revealed
that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was modified by clustered mucin-type O-glycans, and
that the O-glycosite and O-glycan compositions varied with the host cell type.

Figures and Legends
Figure 1. Site-specific O-glycosylation profiling of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. A.
SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins expressed in insect or human cells were digested using trypsin or
a mixture of trypsin and Glu-C. After ZIC-HILIC enrichment and PNGase F digestion, intact
O-glycopeptides were analyzed using a high-resolution mass spectrometer, and their spectra
were characterized using Byonic™ software and validated manually. B. SCE-HCD-MS/MS
spectrum of reported representative O-glycopeptide
