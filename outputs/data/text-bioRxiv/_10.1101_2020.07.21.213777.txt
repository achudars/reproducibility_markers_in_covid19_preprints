Abstract

27

We investigated the immune events following SARS-CoV-2 infection, from the acute

28

inflammatory state up to four weeks post infection, in non-human primates (NHP) with

29

heterogeneous pulmonary pathology. The acute phase was characterized by a robust and

30

rapid migration of monocytes expressing CD16 from the blood and concomitant increase in

31

CD16+ macrophages in the lungs. We identified two subsets of interstitial macrophages

32

(HLA-DR+ CD206–), a transitional CD11c+ CD16+ cell population that was directly

33

associated with IL-6 levels in plasma, and one long lasting CD11b+ CD16+ cell population.

34

Strikingly, levels of monocytes were a correlate of viral replication in bronchial brushes

35

and we discovered TARC (CCL17) as a new potential mediator of myeloid recruitment to

36

the lungs. Worse disease outcomes were associated with high levels of cell infiltration in

37

lungs including CD11b+ CD16hi macrophages and CD11b+ neutrophils. Accumulation of

38

macrophages was long-lasting and detectable even in animals with mild or no signs of

39

disease. Interestingly, animals with anti-inflammatory responses including high IL-10:IL-6

40

and kynurenine to tryptophan ratios had less signs of disease. Our results unravel cellular

41

mechanisms of COVID-19 and suggest that NHP may be appropriate models to test

42

immune therapies.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a major public health crisis, causing a global medical emergency.

46

There are currently no effective vaccines or drugs approved to completely treat or prevent

47

COVID-19, and much remains unknown about the pathogenesis of the disease. COVID-19

48

presents with highly variable outcomes, and patients that develop symptoms exhibit a wide range

49

of disease, spanning from mild (fever, cough, shortness of breath) to severe (dyspnea,

50

pneumonia, rapidly progressing radiographic changes)1. It is currently estimated that up to 15%

51

of COVID-19 patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)2, which is the

52

major cause of death among fatal SARS-CoV-2 cases. Studies elucidating molecular and

53

immunological details of SARS‐CoV-2 infection are underway, and many of the reported

54

clinical observations point to the disease being at least partly the result of an excessive host

55

response aimed to clear the virus but instead contributing to disease development3. This

56

hypothesis is supported by studies on the closely related coronavirus SARS-CoV-14-6, and by

57

clinical reports showing elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 in SARS-CoV-2

58

infected patients, and profound dysregulation of the myeloid cell compartment, particularly

59

among those with severe symptoms3,7-9.

60
61

Interestingly, the increase in IL-6 coincides with the upregulation of chemokines responsible for

62

myelopoiesis and monocyte recruitment to the lungs3,10 suggesting that peripheral inflammatory

63

monocytes and tissue macrophages may play a role in the cytokine storm seen in severe COVID-

64

19 patients11. The underlying inflammatory state and increased myelopoiesis seen in older

65

individuals may be responsible for the high mortality rate seen in this group12. A better

66

understanding of immunopathology of COVID-19 will aid the development of targeted

67

immunotherapies and effective vaccines.

Non-human primates (NHP) have been used as animal models to study acute respiratory diseases

70

such as SARS and MERS13. In these studies, African green monkeys (AGM) have been shown to

71

be more susceptible to severe disease than rhesus macaques (RM)14. Regardless of species

72

differences, and given the overlap between NHP and with human immune systems, both NHP

73

species have been useful models to study host responses to coronaviruses5. We and others have

74

shown that both AGM and RM can be successfully infected with SARS‐CoV-2 via the intranasal

75

and the intratracheal route, or by aerosol15-18. Following exposure, AGM and RM have high

76

levels of virus replication in the respiratory tract for up to two weeks, and both species develop

77

pulmonary pathology characteristic of COVID-19, that varies from very mild to severe19. Other

78

groups have described the very early immune events in SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques,

79

with perturbation of monocytes populations, increased macrophages in lungs, and cellular

80

activation in blood all happening a few days following the infection16.

81

Here, we extend on these findings by describing the kinetics of immune events following

82

infection, spanning from the acute phase up to four weeks following infection, in the blood and

83

the lungs of four African green monkeys (AGM) and four rhesus macaques (RM) with a

84

heterogeneous spectrum of COVID-19. Overall, we observed a multiphasic mobilization of

85

innate and adaptive cells from the blood to the lung that is strikingly common to both species.

86

The acute inflammatory phase was characterized by an increase in the frequency of monocytes

87

that was positively associated with bronchial viral replication. CD11b+ macrophages and

88

neutrophils were detected in the lungs of all infected animals, however, with greater numbers in

89

severe disease. Consistent with the resolution phase of inflammation in the lung20, the second

90

phase was characterized by a switch toward type 2 responses in both species. We identified two

91

populations of interstitial macrophages (HLA-DR+ CD206–) in BAL; 1) CD11c+ CD16hi

92

population increasing during the acute phase of infection that was associated with IL-6 levels in

93

the plasma, and 2) a long lasting CD11b+ and CD16hi population accumulating in lungs of both

94

AGM and RM, particularly in those with increased disease severity. Animals with more

95

pronounced clinical signs had a higher level of infiltrates in lungs when compared with animals

with no or mild signs, lower IL-10:IL-6 and kynurenine /tryptophan ratios (anti-inflammatory:

97

pro-inflammatory) cytokines in plasma21. By investigating temporal and spatial changes in

98

immune cells our study links together findings in both NHP and human patients and unravels

99

new cellular events of COVID-1922,23. Further, we show that NHP are highly relevant models to

100

study COVID-19 immunopathology and suggest that they may be appropriate models to test

101

immune therapies and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.

and disease severity. Four adult RM and four adult AGM were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by

107

either aerosol or mucosal challenge including buccal, intranasal, intratracheal, and conjunctival

108

(multi-route) exposure (Supplementary Table 1). The study concluded at 4 weeks post

109

exposure (Fig. 1A)18. All eight animals had detectable viral load by RT-PCR on nasal and

110

pharyngeal swabs and bronchial brushes by week 1 (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Table 2). Viral

111

RNA was also detected in pharyngeal, nasal, buccal, rectal and vaginal swabs. No differences in

112

viral load (VL) were observed between the different routes of exposure or between the two

113

species at week 1 (Supplementary Table 2 and Fig. 1B). Of note, by week 2 AGM had higher

114

VL than RM in the bronchial brushes and by week 3 VL in RM was mostly undetectable while it

115

remained above detection levels in AGM until study completion (Fig. 1B and Supplementary

116

Table 2). Similar to humans, the course of disease varied widely across animals, as detailed in

117

Table 1. Of the four AGM enrolled, two animals developed severe respiratory signs and were

118

euthanized on days 8 (NC34) and 22 (NC33) post-infection, following established endpoint

119

criteria for NHP study protocols, and as we previously reported18. Of the two remaining AGM,

120

NC38 had multifocal mild to moderate interstitial pneumonia scattered throughout all lung lobes

121

and NC40 was mostly asymptomatic and had scant inflammation in all lung lobes at necropsy.

122

Three of the four RM (GH99, HD09, and FR04) developed pneumonia characterized by a

123

granulomatous to pyogranulomatous inflammatory response. This was severe in GH99, mild in

124

HD09, and minimal in FR04. Histopathology of the fourth RM (HB37) revealed a lymphocytic

125

vasculitis and proliferative vasculopathy in the right middle lung lobe.

126

Clinical signs observed during the course of the study included mild tachypnea (day 11) and

127

cough (day 15) in GH99 (Supplementary Table 3). Intermittent mild to moderate pyrexia was

128

observed in HB37 (day 1-21 post infection). Radiographic changes included a nodule in the right

129

caudal lung lobe (day 11) in GH99, and HD09 also developed a mild, focal increased opacity in

130

the ventral lung field at day 11 (data not shown).Viral loads in the bronchial alveolar brushes at

131

all time points, temperature, pulse oxygen levels (SpO2) and ranking did not differ between

132

female (n = 3) and males (n = 5) or between animals exposed to different routes of infection

133

(multi route n = 4 and aerosol n = 4), possibly due to the small number of animals per group

134

(Supplementary Table 2 - 4).

135

Viral load was not significantly associated with pulmonary pathology, however we observed an

136

inverse association between viral load at week 1 and disease severity ranking (1 to 8 from most

137

severe to least severe) based on the above observations and histopathology findings (AGM: R =

138

0.8 ; RM: R = –0.4, all animals: P = 0.057, R = – 0.71, by the Spearman correlation test) (Fig.

139

1C, Supplementary Fig. 1A and 1B (Supplementary Table 5).

140
141

Interestingly, virus-driven immunological changes were remarkably similar between species at

142

this time (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). To investigate overall changes driven by viral

143

replication in both groups, we combined their immunological analysis, however at the same time

144

we maintained different specifications for each species (teal = RM and magenta = AGM). Data

145

and statistics are also shown separately per group in Supplementary Figure 1. At 1 week after

146

infection both AGM and RM had an increase in the absolute number and frequency of

147

monocytes in the blood (P = 0.065, and P = 0.02 respectively, by the Tukey multiple comparison

148

test, n = 8) compared to baseline levels (Fig. 1D and 1E). This change was significant in AGM

149

alone (absolute number: P = 0.0006, n = 4), and was also observed in all RM, particularly GH99

150

(Supplementary Fig. 1C - 1F). Of note, the increase in absolute number of monocytes remain

151

significant when GH99 was removed from the statistical analysis (P = 0.00002, Supplementary

152

Fig. 1G). The absolute number of neutrophils in blood did not change over time

153

(Supplementary Fig. 1H). Interestingly, the absolute number of monocytes at week 1 was

154

strongly positively associated with the viral load levels in the bronchial brush samples (P =

155

0.002, R = 0.93 by the Spearman test) when all the animals were combined (Fig. 1F) (AGM: R =

156

0.8; R: R = 1, not significant in separated groups, Supplementary Fig. 1I and 1J), and remained

157

significant when GH99 was removed from the statistical analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1K).

158

We then used the CD14 and CD16 markers to discriminate between three circulating monocytes

159

subtypes: classical (CD14hi CD16low), intermediate (CD14hi CD16hi) and non-classical

160

(CD14low CD16hi) within the total (CD45, live , HLA-DR+ CD16hi) monocyte population by

161

flow cytometry (Fig. 1G - 1I and Supplementary Fig. 2). Subsets were gated as shown in

162

Supplementary Figure 2A, using a strategy that excludes CD16+ NK cells that are negative for

163

HLA-DR24. At week 1, the frequency of classical monocytes was significantly increased in

164

blood, as seen in humans25, and the non-classical population was profoundly depleted (increased

165

levels baseline versus week 1: classical P = 0.007 and decreased non-classical P = 0.005 in all

166

animals combined, n = 4) (Fig. 1H and 1I, and Supplementary Fig. 2B – 2E). As we observed

167

for the frequency, the absolute counts of classical and non-classical monocytes at week 1 were

168

also significantly increased and decreased, respectively, compared to the baseline values

169

(Supplementary Figure 2F - G). Interestingly, pre infection levels were never completely

170

restored even after 3 weeks post-infection (week 1 vs. week 3: classical P = 0.03 and non-

171

classical P = 0.03), as the number of circulating CD16hi monocytes increased overtime (non-

172

classical week 1 versus week 3: P = 0.0019). These results suggest emerging myelopoiesis and

173

rapid and robust recruitment of patrolling monocytes in tissues following infection in both

174

species. We did not observe changes in the frequency or number of intermediate monocytes

175

(Supplementary Fig. 2H and 2I). In line with what we observed for the total monocyte count, at

176

week 1 the counts for the subsets of monocytes were positively associated with viral replication

177

detected at the bronchial alveolar sites (classical: R = 0.98; P = 0.06, non-classical: R = 0.96; P =

178

0.03 and intermediate R = 0.94; P = 0.06, by the Pearson test), further suggesting that the robust

179

myelopoiesis is therefore driven by the virus in the lung. Within the total monocytes, the

180

frequency of non-classical monocytes was significantly associated with lower viral loads

181

(classical: R = -0.9867; P = 0.0133, by the Pearson Test, adjusted for multiple comparison P =

182

0.07). It is important to note that none of these analyses were significant when the values were

183

adjusted for multiple comparisons (Supplementary Table 6).

184

Recent studies in humans have described an increase in the frequency of CD14 positive cells

185

expressing low levels of HLA-DR in COVID-19 patients. These cells phenotypically resemble

186

suppressive subsets of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)8 thus they may decrease

187

disease driven inflammation. We and others have previously identified MDSCs in blood of

188

monkeys by flow cytometry as HLA-DRlow CD14hi cells within the CD45/live population26,27.

189

Some of the animals in our study showed increased MDSCs frequency at week 3 compared to

190

baseline levels, however these changes were not significant (Supplementary Fig. 2L). We

191

measured Arginase 1 activity as a functional assay to assess the function of immunosuppressive

192

myeloid cells at the same time points (baseline and week 3) and we did not observe significant

193

changes in plasma overtime (Supplementary Fig. 2M)28.

194
195

We analyzed a group of eight chemokines known to be involved in the mobilization of innate

196

cells, including monocytes, from the blood to the lung: IP-10 (CXCL-10), MCP-1 (CCL2),

197

MCP-4 (CCL13), Eotaxin, TARC (CCL17), MDC (CCL22), MIP-1a and MIP-1b

198

(Supplementary Fig 3A - 3H). Some of the chemokines measured at baseline in plasma differed

199

between the two species (MCP-4, Eotaxin, MIP-1b and MDC) as shown by the principle

200

component analysis in Supplementary Fig. 3I (Supplementary Tables 7 - 9). Plasma levels of

201

TARC (CCL17), a ligand for CCR4 that is involved in Th2 cell recruitment29, were strongly

202

associated with the frequency of monocytes in blood (P = 0.003, R = 0.95, Spearman test,

203

adjusted for multiple comparison: P = 0.02) (Fig. 1J). Similarly, TARC/CCL17 was also

204

associated with viral replication in BAL at week 1 (Fig. 1K and Supplementary Fig. 3J and

205

3K) (P = 0.02, R = 0.857, adjusted for multiple comparisons: P = 0.2, and R = 0.927 and P=

206

0.016 when GH99 is excluded from the analysis), as was IP-10 (P = 0.05, R = 0.78, adjusted for

207

multiple comparisons) when all animals were grouped together (Fig. 1K and Supplementary

208

Fig. 3L), a ligand for CXCR3 that is associated with disease severity and predicts progression of

209

COVID-19 in humans30. To gain a better understanding of a common milieu possibly driving

210

monocyte migration observed in both groups we analyzed changes in the levels of these markers

211

with respect to the baseline (Fig. 1L and Supplementary Table 8). Overall this analysis

212

revealed that animals with the most severe disease outcomes had higher levels of chemokines at

213

week 1, including IP-10, TARC (CCL17).

214
215

Myelomonocytic cells infiltrate BAL and are associated with IL-6. Influx of macrophages has

216

been observed in the lung of severe cases of COVID-19 in humans31. To monitor cell trafficking

217

into the lungs, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at baseline and after each week

218

following infection, up to week 3. As expected, the majority of the cells found in BAL at

219

baseline were alveolar macrophages (AM)32. These cells are readily identified by the mannose

220

receptor C type 1 (CD206) marker, express high levels of HLA-DR, and are positive for the

221

scavenger receptor CD163 (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 4A and 4B), we observed a decrease in

222

the proportion of AM at week 1 post infection in animals of both species, corresponding with an

223

influx of myeloid HLA-DR+ CD206– CD163– cells (Fig. 2A and 2B, Supplementary Fig. 4C).

224

Levels of AM similar to pre-infection were restored at week 2 in all but one animal (GH99), and

225

a concomitant increase of CD86 mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) in this population was

226

observed suggesting an M1 activation state33 (Supplementary Fig. 4D). An increase was also

227

seen in the frequency of CD206+ CD163–that have been previously described as endothelial

228

cells which facilitate lymphocyte trafficking and they are detectable in BAL during inflammatory

229

events (Fig. 2C)34.

230

T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) analysis revealed changes in the phenotype

231

of CD16, CD11b, and CD11c positive populations most prominently at 1-2 weeks post infection

232

(Fig. 2D - 2F). In contrast to what we observed in the blood, there was an increase of CD16+

233

HLA-DR+ cells in BAL over time (Fig. 2G, and Supplementary Fig. 4E and 4F). We observed

234

a transient increase in the level of CD11c+ CD16+ myelomonocytic cells, which function has

235

been described as patrolling, and they participate in rapid tissue invasion and monocyte survival

236

(baseline vs. week 1: P = 0.015) (Fig. 2H)35,36. The frequency of CD11c+ macrophages in BAL

237

at week 3 was strongly associated with the levels of the proinflammatory IL-6 cytokine in the

238

plasma at the same time point (week 3: P = 0.003, R = 0.96, Spearman test) (Supplementary

239

Fig. 5). The CD11b marker is required for monocyte migration to sites of inflammation37, and is

240

highly expressed on myeloid cells recruited from the blood and differentiating into

241

macrophages38. We also observed an increase in the percentage of CD11b+ CD16+ HLA-DR+

242

CD206– myelomonocytic cells in BAL at week 2 and 3 following infection (Fig. 2I), a

243

population that is involved in regulating lung inflammatory response20,33,39,40. The gating strategy

244

for the two myelomonocytic cells populations is shown in Supplementary Figure 4G.

245
246

Interstitial macrophages accumulate in lungs of infected animals. Lungs were collected for

247

all animals at the end of the study, corresponding to 4 weeks post infection (1 week following the

248

last BAL collection shown in Figure 2), with the exception of NC33 and NC34. These two

249

animals had higher levels of IL-6 at necropsy compared to the other six monkeys, and NC34 had

250

symptoms similar to ARDS18 (Fig. 3). Overall, infiltration of macrophages was observed in the

251

lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected AGM and RM at necropsy and was more robust in animals with

252

severe disease (Fig. 3A). We further characterized macrophages population in the lung by

253

staining with the AM marker CD206 (in blue) and with CD11b integrin (in green) and CD16

254

(red) (Fig. 3B). Low numbers of macrophages were seen in the lungs of a non-infected control

255

RM, scattered throughout the interstitium and alveolar spaces, as shown by the arrows. In the

256

control this population was bi-morphic and composed of CD11b negative CD16+ CD206–

257

(arrow) in the alveolar septa or CD16+ CD206+ cells within the alveolar spaces (arrowhead)

258

(Fig. 3B). In all animals that were infected we could detect CD11b+ CD16+ macrophages. FR04

259

(RM ranking = 7) lungs had macrophages scattered throughout the interstitium and alveolar

260

spaces. The phenotypic population was heterogeneous and contained low numbers of CD11b+

261

CD16+ CD206– macrophages. The most severe RM, GH99 (ranking = 3), had large numbers of

262

macrophages multifocally surrounding small airways denoted by the asterisks. Of note this

263

animal had the higher absolute number of monocytes in the blood at week 1 (Supplementary

264

Fig. 1D). Low numbers of CD11b+ CD16+ CD206– cells were scattered throughout the

265

predominant population of CD11b+ CD16+ CD206+ macrophages. Macrophages were also

266

scattered throughout the interstitium and alveolar spaces. NC34 and NC33 (AGM ranking = 1

267

and 2 respectively) had multifocal to coalescing areas of hemorrhage (NC33 indicated by the

arrows), and pulmonary parenchyma infiltrated by multifocal aggregates of macrophages (NC34)

269

with infiltration by low to moderate numbers of macrophages. The phenotypic population was

270

heterogenous and composed of moderate numbers of CD11b+ CD16+ CD206– macrophages.

271

Aggregates were determined by staining animals FR04, GH99, and NC34 with CD68/CD163

272

(red) and CD3: (blue). Animal FR04 (RM ranking = 7) had isolated CD3+ cells scattered

273

throughout the lung. GH99 (RM ranking = 3) had cell aggregate with mixed populations of

274

CD3+ and CD68/CD163+ cells in isolated area of inflammation. NC34 (AGM ranking = 1) had

275

rare, small aggregates of CD3+ cells (Supplementary Figure 6). Altogether these findings

276

present a picture of long-lasting lung inflammation that, albeit more pronounced in animals with

277

severe signs of disease, is also present in animals with no detectable viral load and mild or no

278

signs of disease after 4 weeks from the start of infection.

279
280

Neutrophils accumulate in animals with severe disease. In this study we did not observe

281

changes in the absolute number of neutrophils in blood during the course of the infection

282

(Supplementary Figure 1H). Interestingly, studies in monkeys and humans showed increased

283

levels of neutrophils and suggested deregulation of their maturation, with CD11b being one of

284

the markers defining pre-neutrophils8,9,41-43. We stained lungs from animals NC33, NC34, GH99,

285

FR04 and NC40 with anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody for neutrophils and with anti-

286

CD11b antibody, and we included two controls, one RM and one AGM (Figure 4A). MPO+

287

cells44 were elevated in animals with severe disease (NC33, NC34). GH99 had areas with

288

neutrophil accumulation and the remaining animals were low. Controls had very few neutrophils

289

in the lungs (Figure 4B). CD11b+ MPO+ neutrophils were only present in infected animals and

290

were also high in NC33 (Figure 4C). Accordingly, neutrophils and lymphocytes could be seen in

291

animals with severe disease but not in animals with moderate disease (Supplementary Fig. 7).

292

NC34 (necropsy day 8 post infection; rank = 1, severe) had lymphocytic aggregates that were

293

perivascular and intermixed with neutrophils and histiocytes. In NC38 (necropsy day 28, rank 5,

294

moderate) lymphocytic aggregates are scattered within the alveolar septa and predominately

295

mixed with histiocytes and rare neutrophils.

296
297

NKG2a+ cells and PD-1+ T cells decrease in blood and increase in BAL overtime.

298

Infiltration of lymphocytes was observed in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected AGM and RM at

299

necropsy and was more robust in animals with severe disease (Fig. 5A). We first analyzed the

300

kinetics of innate NK cells subsets, that we defined as HLA-DR– CD3– cells expressing the

301

NKG2a receptors, which are known to traffic to the lung45 (Fig. 5B - D, and Supplementary

302

Fig. 8). Interestingly, the frequencies of NKG2a+ cells significantly decreased in peripheral

303

blood of both AGM and RM over the course of infection (baseline vs. week 3, P = 0.03) (Fig.

304

5B). Consistent with the pattern described for the myeloid population, we also observed a

13

305

concomitant increase in the frequencies of NKG2a+ cells in BAL (baseline vs. week 3, P = 0.05)

306

(Fig. 5C and 5D, Supplementary Fig. 8A - 8C). Four out of four AGM had decreased NKG2a+

307

cells in peripheral blood, coinciding with an increase of the same cells in BAL. While the pattern

308

of NKG2a+ cells in peripheral blood of RM was not statistically significant, nonetheless in this

309

species there was a marked increase of those cells in the BAL. These results suggest that the loss

310

of NKG2a+ cells in the PBMCs and the gain of NKG2a+ cells in the BAL may coincide with an

311

egress of these cells from peripheral blood to tissues. Accordingly, the frequency of NKG2a+

312

cells expressing CXCR3, a marker associated with NK cell migration to the lung46 also

313

significantly decreased in blood over time (baseline vs. week 3, P = 0.03, Fig. 5E). Despite this

314

change in lymphocyte phenotype, the absolute number of lymphocytes did not change over the

315

first 2 weeks of infection (Fig. 5F) however it is important to note that all 3 remaining AGM had

316

an increase at week 3 (Supplementary Fig. 8D – 8E).

317

tSNE analysis revealed an increase in the level of PD-1 at weeks 2 and 3 post-infection,

318

overlapping with spatial regions corresponding to both CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5G and

319

Supplementary Fig. 9A). In fact, the frequency of PD-1+ CD4+ T cells was elevated in the

320

blood of both RM and AGM (Fig. 5H, and 5I, respectively). During the first week following the

321

infection we observed an increase in IP-10 and IFN-g (Supplementary Fig. 9B), however we

322

also observed a switch toward Th2 type responses characterized by the increase of Th2 cytokines

323

IL-5 and IL-13 over time (Supplementary Fig. 9B). Accordingly, a gradual increase of Th2 type

324

cells (defined as CXCR3– CCR6 – CD4+ T cells)24 was seen in the blood within the PD-1

325

positive population (Fig. 5J). The increase of PD-1+ Th2 cells was significantly and positively

326

associated with IL-4 cytokine levels (P = 0.016, R = 0.94, Spearman test) (Supplementary Fig.

327

9C). Moreover, we observed an increased level of PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in blood and BAL (BAL:

14

328

baseline vs. week 2, P = 0.015; baseline vs. week 3, P = 0.03) (data not shown and Fig. 5K).

329

Animals divided by species are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9D and 9E. Associations between

330

viral replication and the frequency of PD1+ CD4 T cells in blood and PD1+ CD8 T cells in BAL

331

at week 3 were found (Supplementary Fig. 9G- I), however, they were most likely driven by

332

the AGM but not RM which had no detectable viral replication in bronchial brushes at that

333

specific time point.

334
335

The ratio between the anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory responses is associated with

336

disease progression. The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 has been described as a strong

337

predictor to disease progression in humans3,7. We measured IL-6 and IL-10 in the plasma of all

338

the animals (Fig. 6A). While IL-6 levels alone did not associate with disease severity in NHPs,

339

the ratio of IL-10 to IL-6 levels measured in plasma associated with both the ranking of disease

340

severity and with the pathological score that was obtained by analyzing the extension of the

341

inflammation and edema of the lungs (R = 0.76 P = 0.037; and R = –0.76, P = 0.03, by the

342

Spearman correlation test, all animals) (Fig. 6B and C). To investigate further, we also measured

343

the levels of tryptophan and kynurenine in plasma at baseline, week 1, week 3 and at necropsy

344

(Supplementary Figure 10). Kynurenine was elevated and significantly increased at week 3

345

compared to baseline levels (P= 0.013 adj.). The kynurenine (Kyn)/ tryptophan (Tryp) ratio has

346

been used as a measurement of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity and is often

347

associated with T regulatory cell function (21).. In line with the observed association for the IL-

348

10:IL-6 ratio, the Kyn /Tryp ratio was also negatively correlated with the pathology score (1 =

349

mild – 18 = severe) suggesting that animals with higher levels of immune suppression had less

350

inflammation in the lung and better disease outcome (Figure 6D).

351

These findings show a complex series of immune events in the lung of that are most likely

352

initiated as a host response to the virus and then evolving overtime toward less antiviral

353

responses, as summarized in Figure 6E.

354

357

DISCUSSION

358

The development of such strategies requires a clear understanding of the immune cells involved

359

in COVID-19 and their unique role in pathogenesis. Clinical observations in patients and few

360

studies on non-human primates have started to shed light on the immune aspects involved in

361

COVID-198,9,11,22,47,48. Here, we further characterized immune events following SARS-CoV-2

362

infection in two NHPs models recapitulating crucial aspects of COVID-19 lung disease16,18.

There is an urgent need to develop safe and effective strategies to prevent and treat COVID-19.

363
364

Altogether our findings provide the first evidence in both AGM and RM of a multiphasic

365

immune response characterized by 1) an initial inflammatory phase with monocyte recruitment

366

to the lung 2) a gradual switch from a type 1 to type 2 response, and 3) a “make it or break it”

367

phase with either an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and regulatory cell subsets

368

with suppressive activity, or IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine associated with disease

369

progression in humans, as summarized in Figure 6E.

370

By examining the temporal and spatial distribution of monocytes, myelomonocytic cells and

371

macrophages in blood and BAL and lungs, we confirmed and extended on studies in humans and

372

NHPs suggesting increased myelopoiesis with recruitment of myeloid cells from the blood to

373

lungs during the infection that is initially driven by the virus replicating in the lung3,16,22. Similar

374

to what has been described by Wilk et al. and Thevarajan et al. in humans, we observed an

16

375

increase of classical CD14hi monocytes, and a corresponding drop in the frequency of

376

monocytes expressing CD16 in the peripheral blood22,23. Importantly, we extend on these

377

findings by showing a simultaneous increase in the frequency patrolling CD16hi HLA-DR+

378

monocytes in BAL occurring in both species and by describing the kinetics of two CD16+ HLA-

379

DR+ CD206– macrophages populations that preferentially populate the alveolar interstitium and

380

exhibit features of antigen-presenting cells49. CD11c+ CD16+ cells arising from intravascular

381

CD16hi patrolling monocytes in the acute phase and associating with IL-6 levels, and a CD11b+

382

macrophage population known to be involved in resolution of inflammation in the lung20,33,39,40.

383

Higher frequencies of CD11b+ monocytes with increased disease severity has been observed in

384

the blood of humans8. The origin and the exact function of these interstitial macrophages remains

385

to be determined.

386

Differently than what was observed in humans and previously reported data in RM, we did not

387

detect an increase in the number of neutrophils, as these responses may have come up earlier

388

than 1 week after infection as shown by others16. At necropsy, CD11b+ MPO+ neutrophils were

389

present in the lungs of animals with severe disease as observed in humans. More studies are

390

needed to determine if SARS-CoV-2 results in the accumulation of immature neutrophils as seen

391

in humans 8,9.

392
393

Common to both species was the observation that animals with higher levels of myeloid and

394

lymphoid cell infiltration in the lung had worse disease outcomes. Several studies in both SARS-

395

CoV-1 and CoV-2 have reported depleted peripheral NK cell counts in severe patients11,22,25,47.

396

Our data support the notion of NKG2a+ cell trafficking to the lung during SARS-CoV-2

397

infection, most likely mediated by IP-10 (CXCL-10), which promotes the recruitment of

17

398

CXCR3+ Th1 thymocytes and NKs50,51. Expression of NKG2a has been linked to both activation

399

and inhibition of inflammation52; the function in SARS-CoV-2 remains to be investigated. In the

400

periphery, we also observed increased levels of PD-1 on T cells. This is consistent with findings

401

in humans describing of an exhaustive T cell phenotype during SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2

402

infection11,53.

403
404

For the first time, we identified TARC (CCL17) as a possible mediator of myeloid recruitment in

405

the lung during SARS-CoV-2. Both dendritic cells and CD11b+ macrophages in the lung have

406

been identified as a source of CCL17 in the airways in other pulmonary inflammatory

407

diseases54,55.These cells promote the recruitment of T helper type 2 (Th2) lymphocytes into the

408

airways54. Remarkably, we observed a gradual increase of the recruitment of Th2 lymphocytes

409

into the airway and of Th2 type cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13. These findings show a

410

complex series of immune events in the lung of that are most likely initiated as a host response to

411

the virus, and that they may evolve into other less effective antiviral responses as either an

412

attempt to tissue repair/resolution of inflammation, as summarized in Figure 6E, or as the result

413

of virus direct immunomodulatory effects on host responses6.

414
415

Intrinsic species-specific susceptibility to disease progression has been described for NHP in

416

SARS-CoV-16 with AGM being more susceptible than rhesus to severe disease. There were

417

unexpected similarities in the kinetics and the quality of the immune responses analyzed in RM

418

and AGM, particularly during the acute phase of infection, however AGM did not clear the

419

infection as well as RM and two AGM had most severe symptoms56. While the number of

420

animals enrolled in this study was not sufficient to look at species-specific differences and their

18

421

effect on disease progression, we found that a higher ratio of IL-10: IL-6 in plasma was

422

associated with disease severity. Undoubtedly, more studies are needed to prove or disprove the

423

single contribution of IL-10 and IL-6 in the outcome of COVID-19 disease and to identify the

424

source of these two potential key players57. The notion that dynamically balanced pro and anti-

425

immune responses to SASR-CoV-2 play an important role in disease progression and outcome is

426

supported by the association of the pathological score and the Kyn /Tryp suggesting a role of T

427

regulatory cells in resolution of inflammation of the lungs in COVID-19.

428
429

Overall, this study uncovers critical steps in the immune events of the host response to SARS-

430

CoV-2 and describes new correlates of viral replication and disease progression. Importantly, we

431

show viral driven inflammation/cell recruitment to the lung occurs rapidly, and lasts up to four

432

weeks post infection, which may explain in part the observed slow recovery from COVID-19

433

seen humans. Finally, these findings have the potential to aid the interpretation of the results of

434

the human trials that are currently underway for several vaccine candidates and may be

435

instrumental in generating new targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at resolving the severe

436

immune deregulation of the lung of COVID-19 patients.

Animals and infection. Four adult-aged African green monkeys (Caribbean origin) and four

449

rhesus macaques (Indian ancestry) were exposed to SARS-CoV-2; 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020

450

409 (MN985325.1). The virus stock was prepared in Vero E6 cells and the sequence confirmed

451

by PCR and/or Sanger sequencing. Plaque assays were performed in Vero E6 cells. The rhesus

452

macaques were from the Tulane National Primate Research Center breeding colony pathogen

453

free for simian type D retrovirus (SRV), macacine herpesvirus 1 (B virus), simian

454

immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian T cell lymphotropic/leukemia virus (STLV), measles

455

virus (MV) and tuberculosis (TB). The African green monkeys were wild caught and at the

456

TNPRC for over a year before being assigned to this study. To mimic different possible routes of

457

infection in humans, animals were exposed to the virus either by aerosol (inhaled dose of 2.0 x

458

103 and 2.5 x 103 TCID50) or by inoculating a cumulative dose of 3.61 x 106 PFU through

459

multiple routes (oral, nasal, intratracheal, conjunctival) (Supplementary Table 1).

460

The multi route exposure was given to four animals, one adult RM male (GH99, 14 years old),

461

one adult RM female (HD09, 13 years old) and two AGM, one aged male (NC40, 16 years old,

462

approximately) and one aged female (NC33, 16 years old, approximately). An additional two

463

adult males RM (FR04 and HB37, 15 and 13 years old, respectively) and one aged male and

464

female AGM: NC34 and NC38 (16 years old, approximately) were exposed by aerosol

465

(Supplementary Table 1). Rhesus macaques tend to live approximately 20 years in captivity,

466

while African green monkeys live approximately 15 years58. The age of the macaques is

467

generally multiplied by three when compared to humans, and GH99 had signs of aged lungs that

468

were not associated with COVID-19.

Cell count and CO2 and SpO2 pressure measurements. Total white blood cell counts, white

471

blood cell differentials, red blood cell counts, platelet counts, hematocrit values, total

472

hemoglobin concentrations, mean cell volumes, mean corpuscular volumes, and mean

473

corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations were analyzed from blood collected in tubes containing

474

EDTA using a SYSMEX XN-1000v Hematology Analyzer in the Level 2 Lab and a Sysmex XS-

475

1000 in the Level 3 Lab. CO2 measurements were taken using the Piccolo Express Chemistry

476

Analyzer in the Level 3 lab and is part of the Metabolic Comprehensive Panel. SpO2 values were

477

obtained using the Masimo Rad-57 Handheld Pulse Oximeter (Supplementary Table 3).

479

Sample collection and processing. Blood EDTA was collected by venipuncture and bronchial

480

brush and BAL by bronchoscopy. For the latter, the bronchoscope is introduced into the trachea

481

and directed into one of the bronchi. The bronchoscope is advanced to the point where the

482

diameter of the bronchoscope approximates the dimensions of the bronchus. The bronchial brush

483

is passed through the channel of the bronchoscope. The brush is gently advanced until the lumen

484

of the bronchus or bronchioles approximates the dimensions of the brush. The brush is then be

485

gently advanced back and forth against the mucosa to gather cells. The brush is removed from

486

the channel of the bronchoscope and the brush is placed into 200 μL of DNA/RNA Shield X1

487

(Cat.# R1200, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). The bronchoscope remains in place while two

488

aliquots of 20 ml of saline each are instilled into the bronchus and subsequently aspirated. This

489

procedure is then repeated in the opposite lung.

490
491

Blood was layered over Ficoll-Plaque Plus (GE Healthcare17144003) and centrifuged for 30

492

minutes in cap-locked adaptors. Differential migration of cells during centrifugation results in

493

the formation of layers containing different cell types and allows collection of peripheral blood

494

mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from other populations. PBMCs were collected, counted and

495

aliquoted in tubes or resuspended in freezing media containing Fetal Bovine Serum and DMSO.

496

For bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), cells and supernatant were separated by centrifugation (15

497

minutes at 2,000 x g at RT) in cap-locked adaptors and cells were lysed in Ammonium Chloride

498

Potassium (ACK) lysing buffer at room temperature for 5 minutes (Gibco# A1049201) washed

499

in 2% FBS, and resuspended in PBS and counted under laminar flux hood in BCL3. Fresh cells

500

were stained for flow cytometry.

501
502

BAL and PBMCs staining. Freshly obtained PBMCs and cells obtained from BAL were stained

503

with appropriate antibody cocktails and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature.

504

Antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table 10. Cells were fixed with 4% or 2% PFA-BSA

505

overnight. Samples were run on a FACSAria Fusion flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) within a

506

Biosafety Cabinet, and each sample was run for at least five minutes. For all panels, the

507

LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead cell Stain kit was used (ThermoFisher #L34957). Monocytes

508

subsets were gated as described in Supplementary Figure 2A and as previously described24.

509

Alveolar macrophages were gated based on the size and the expression of HLA-DR, CD206 and

510

CD163 markers. Myeloid infiltrates were gated as cells negative for CD206 and CD163 and

511

positive for HLA-DR, CD16 and CD11b. The gating strategy is shown in Supplementary

512

Figure 4G. NKG2a+ cells were gated on the CD3 negative parent population as shown (BAL

513

FR04 week 2) in Supplementary Figure 8A. Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells were gated as previously

514

described24. tSNE analyses were performed in FlowJo using the opt-SNE algorithm and plots

515

were created in R using the ggplot2 package59.

Histopathology and scoring. Tissue samples were fixed in Z-fix (Anatech), embedded in

518

paraffin and 5 µm thick sections were cut, adhered to charged glass slides and stained with

519

hematoxylin and eosin. All slides were scanned on a Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1 digital slide scanner.

520

Images were acquired using HALO software (Indica Labs). Quantification of pathologic lesions

521

was performed with HALO software. Machine learning (Random Forest) algorithms were

522

trained by a board -certified pathologist to recognize fluidic and cellular inflammation in the

523

lungs of the RM and AGM. Scores were assigned to fluidic and cellular inflammation,

524

separately, based on the percentage of lung affected. Fluidic and cellular inflammation scores

525

were summated for all lobes and animals were ranked from 1 (highest sum) to 8 (lowest sum).

527

Plasma cytokines and chemokines. Plasma was collected by spinning and was thawed before

528

use. Cytokines were measured using 497 Mesoscale Discovery. IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10

529

and IL-13 were part of the V-Plex Proinflammatory Panel 1, 10-Plex. V-plex. The chemokine

530

panel (#K15049D, Mesoscale Discovery, Rockville, Maryland) was also used, following the

Heatmaps were generated using the ‘pheatmap’ package in R60,61. Data were normalized by

533

dividing raw values at week 1 by baseline values for each animal, followed by the application of

534

log2. Values below the limit of detection were replaced with the lowest limit of detection value

535

based on the standard curve for each run, or with the lowest value detected during the run,

536

whichever was smaller. Bubble plots were generated using the ‘ggplot2’ package in R, using the

537

same normalized data shown in the heatmap59. Scatter plots were drawn using raw data points

538

and display Pearson’s correlation coefficients and a 95% confidence interval.

RNA isolation. Swab and bronchial brush samples were collected in 200 μL of

541

DNA/RNA Shield X1 (Cat.# R1200, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) and extracted for Viral RNA

542

(vRNA) using the Quick-RNAViral kit (Cat.# R1034/5, Zymo Research). The Viral RNA

543

Buffer dispensed directly to the swab in the DNA/RNA Shield. The swab was directly inserted

544

into the spin column. The vRNA was eluted (45μL) and 5 μL was added in a 0.1 mL fast 96-well

545

optical microtiter plate (Cat.# 4346906, ThermoFisher, CA).

546
547

Viral RNA detection. RT-qPCR reaction TaqPath1-Step MultiplexMaster Mix was used (Cat.#

548

A28527, ThermoFisher) along with the 2019-nCoV RUO Kit (Cat.# 10006713, IDTDNA,

549

Coralville, IA) targeting the N1 amplicon of N gene of SARS2-nCoV19 (accession MN908947).

550

The master mix was added to the microtiter plates covered with optical film (cat. #4311971;

551

ThermoFisher) and then was vortexed and pulse centrifuged. The RT-qPCR program consisted

552

of incubation at 25°C for 2 minutes, RT incubation at 50°C for 15 minutes, and an enzyme

553

activation at 95°C for 2 minutes followed by 40 cycles of denaturing step at 95°C for 3 seconds

554

and annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds. Fluorescence signals were detected with an Applied

555

Biosystems QuantStudio6 Sequence Detector. Data were captured and analyzed with Sequence

556

Detector Software v1.3 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Viral copy numbers were

557

calculated by plotting Cq Values obtained from unknown (i.e. test) samples against a standard

558

curve representing known viral copy numbers. The limit of detection of the assay was 10 copies

559

per reaction volume. A 2019-nCoVpositive control (Cat.#10006625, IDTDNA) were analyzed in

560

parallel with every set of test samples. A non-template control (NTC) was also included.

561
562

Immunohistochemistry. Five µm sections of Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung were

563

mounted on charged glass slides, baked overnight at 56oC and passed through Xylene, graded

564

ethanol, and double distilled water to remove paraffin and rehydrate tissue sections. A

565

microwave was used for heat induced epitope retrieval, which was performed sequentially with

566

high and low pH solutions from Vector Labs (H-3301 and H-3300). CD16+ and MPO+ cells

567

were detected using MACH3 AP kits (Biocare Medical M3M532 or M3R533) and permanent

568

red substrate (Dako K0640). MPO+ cells CD3+ cells CD11b+ cells CD68+/CD163+ cells, and

569

CD206+ cells were detected using antibodies described in Supplementary Table 10. Slides

570

were incubated with a blocking buffer comprised of either 1% normal donkey serum or 10%

571

normal goat serum for 40 minutes. All primary antibodies were incubated for 60 minutes and all

572

secondary antibodies for 40 minutes at room temperature, with thorough washing in between.

573

DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) was used to label the nuclei of each section. Slides were

574

mounted using a homemade anti-quenching mounting media containing Mowiol (Calbiochem

575

#475904) and DABCO (Sigma #D2522) and imaged with a Zeiss Axio Slide Scanner.

577

Arginase Activity. Arginase activity was analyzed on Plasma using the Arginase Activity Assay

578

Kit (MAK112, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) following the manufacturer instructions. Briefly,

579

samples were thawed on ice and, in order to deplete the urea, 40 μl of plasma were loaded in an

580

Amicon®Ultra 10K centrifugal filter (UFC501096 EMD Millipore), diluted with pure water to

581

500 μl, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. Following centrifugation, the eluted

582

solution was discarded. Filtered samples were then diluted with pure water to 500 μl, and

583

centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. At the end of centrifugation, the remaining volume

584

of each sample was measured, and ultra-pure water was added to reach a final volume of 40 μl.

585

Each sample was loaded into 2 wells of a 96-well plate (20 μl/well), representing the sample well

586

and the sample blank well, and 20 μl/well of ultra-pure water were added to each well. Together

587

with samples, the plate was loaded with urea standard and water as positive and negative

588

controls, respectively. Samples were loaded in singlicate, whereas controls were loaded in

589

duplicate. Ten microliters of 5X substrate buffer, composed of Arginine Buffer and Mn Solution,

590

were added to the wells except for sample blank wells, and they were incubated for 120 min at

591

37°C. Following the incubation, 200 μl of Urea Reagent, composed of Reagents A and B, was

592

added to each well to stop the reaction. Finally, 10 μl of 5X Substrate Buffer was added to the

593

sample blank wells to have the same reagents proportion of reagents as the Sample Wells. After

594

mixing, the plate was incubated for 60 min at RT, and finally acquired with microplate

595

spectrophotometer Power Wave XS2 (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT) to measure the

596

absorbance at 430 nm (A430) of each well. The arginase activity was determined per the

597

following equation: [ (sample well) - (blank)/(urea- blank)] X [(1mM x50x 103)/40ul x

598

120min)], according to the manufacture instructions.

Kynurenine and Tryptophan Plasma Levels. Tryptophan and Kynurenine plasma

601

concentrations were measured by using the Tryptophan ELISA (Rocky Mountain Diagnostics,

602

Colorado Springs, CO, USA, Catalog #BA E-2700) and Kynurenine ELISA commercial kits

603

(Rocky Mountain Diagnostics, Colorado Springs, CO, USA, Catalog #BA E-2200). For

604

tryptophan measurement, 20 μl of plasma were precipitated, the recovered supernatants were

605

derivatized, and the product was used to perform the ELISA according to manufacturer

606

instructions. For kynurenine assay, 10 μl of plasma were acylated and used to perform the

607

ELISA according to manufacturer instructions. The data are presented as the ratio between

608

kynurenine and tryptophan (Krn/Try) levels.

Statistical analysis. Correlation analyses were performed using the non-parametric Spearman

611

rank correlation method (two-tailed, 95% confidence) using exact permutation P values when

612

ranks were used, or Peason’s correlation test when both variables were continuous. Analysis of

613

variance (ANOVA) was used for comparing statistical differences between multiple groups,

614

followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison tests. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA or Mann-Whitney tests

615

were used. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 8.4.2

616

GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA) and R software (URL http://www.R-project.org/).

617

Correlation plots were created using the ‘Performance Analytics’ and ‘corrr’ plots, respectively,

618

in R61-63.
