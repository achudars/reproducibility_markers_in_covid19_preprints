Abstract
Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is an enveloped pathogen of the family Coronaviridae
that spreads worldwide and causes up to 10% of all annual respiratory diseases. HCoV-NL63 is
typically associated with mild upper respiratory symptoms in children, elderly and
immunocompromised individuals. It has also been shown to cause severe lower respiratory illness.
NL63 shares ACE2 as a receptor for viral entry with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Here we
present the in situ structure of HCoV-NL63 spike (S) trimer at 3.4-Å resolution by single-particle
cryo-EM imaging of vitrified virions without chemical fixative. It is structurally homologous to
that obtained previously from the biochemically purified ectodomain of HCoV-NL63 S trimer,
which displays a 3-fold symmetric trimer in a single conformation. In addition to previously
proposed and observed glycosylation sites, our map shows density at other amino acid positions
as well as differences in glycan structures. The domain arrangement within a protomer is strikingly
different from that of the SARS-CoV-2 S and may explain their different requirements for
activating binding to the receptor. This structure provides the basis for future studies of spike
proteins with receptors, antibodies, or drugs, in the native state of the coronavirus particles.

Introduction
Coronaviridae constitute a large family of enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA
(+ssRNA) viruses capable of causing severe and widespread human respiratory disease. The
coronaviruses are zoonotic pathogens, often circulating among natural reservoirs such as bats or
camels prior to crossing the species barrier into humans (Sabir et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2006).
Coronaviruses are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV),
with human coronaviruses found in two: alpha-CoVs (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and betaCoVs (middle-east respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2)) (Cui et al. 2019). SARS-CoV-2, responsible
for the COVID-19 pandemic, has infected over 19 million people and claimed over 720,000 lives
worldwide as of early August, 2020, underscoring the urgency of studying all circulating human

coronaviruses (https://covid19.who.int/) (Cui et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2020). While beta-CoVs are
more commonly associated with high pathogenesis and severe respiratory disease, alpha-CoVs are
widely circulating viruses associated with cold-like symptoms and in rare cases more serious
respiratory failure (Wang et al. 2020). HCoV-NL63 is estimated to be the causative agent of up to
10% of annual respiratory disease and is a major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in newborns
(Chiu et al. 2005; van der Hoek et al. 2004).
Coronaviruses utilize large (~500-600 kDa) spike (S) homotrimers protruding from the viral
membrane to engage cellular receptors and mediate fusion with host membranes (Pallesen et al.
2017; Thorp et al. 2006). These spikes, numerous on the virus surface, constitute the primary target
of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and are central to vaccine design and structural studies for drug
optimization. Each S molecule contains two large regions: N-terminal S1 responsible for receptorbinding and C-terminal S2 responsible for type-I fusion, as well as an additional single-pass
transmembrane helix that anchors the spikes to the viral envelope (Bosch et al. 2003; Zheng et al.
2006). Spikes are activated by protease cleavage at the S2’ site, near the putative fusion peptide,
allowing the transition from pre- to post-fusion conformation during virus entry (Belouzard et al.
2009).
Several single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of purified, ectodomains of
pre-fusion S trimers from alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genera have been determined, illustrating
conformational heterogeneity of S1, multiple glycosylation sites, and the interactions with soluble
receptors and NAbs (Song et al. 2018; Walls et al. 2016, 2020; Wrapp et al. 2020). These S
complexes lack the helical C-terminal stem that connects S2 to the viral envelope, and require
residues mutated to proline at the loop between the first heptad repeat (HR) and the central helix
to stabilize the construct (Kirchdoerfer et al. 2018; Pallesen et al. 2017; Park et al. 2019). High
resolution structure determinations of molecular components in pleomorphic virions are typically
obtained by single particle cryo-EM or X-ray crystallography of exogenously expressed and
purified components. Conversely, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has been used to
reconstruct tomograms of the whole virus particles, from which subvolume density, corresponding
to the feature of interest, would be further processed by classification and averaging (Schmid et al.
2012; Wan & Briggs 2016). Here, we take the approach of utilizing single-particle cryo-EM
imaging of purified and vitrified HCoV-NL63 virus particles, and then using computational

methods to extract the S trimer density for its high resolution structure determination. Our
approach is similar to a recent preprint report for chemically fixed SARS-CoV-2 particles (Ke et
al. 2020). We report the 3.4-Å structure of the S trimer in its native, pre-fusion state, and expect
our data will be of value in future drug and vaccine design for various strains of coronaviruses
without the need to genetically construct and biochemically purify spike proteins.
Results and Discussion
Since the S timers protrude from the membrane surface of the virion, many of the crown-shaped
S trimers can be easily identified, computationally extracted from the raw images, and treated as
single particle images with a distinct particle orientation without the need of tilting the specimens
(Fig. 1a). Based on the fact that single-particle cryo-EM is a more routine procedure for computing
high-resolution structures compared to cryo-ET, we decided not to collect tilt series, and used
single-particle cryo-EM analysis of the native S trimer on purified and vitrified virions. The 2D
class averages showed a clear triangular shape for the S trimer and other distinct views (Fig. 1b).
De novo building of the initial map, using the “Ab initial reconstruction” option in cryoSPARC
without any symmetry applied, resulted in a three-dimensional (3D) structure with well-defined
features. Further 3D refinement was performed with and without C3 symmetry to obtain 3.4 Å and
3.7 Å maps, respectively (Fig. 1c-e and Fig. S1). The reconstructed map without imposed
symmetry also displayed 3-fold symmetry, showing a high cross-correlation coefficient (CC =
0.9802) with the symmetric map (Fig. S1d). Hereafter, we will present our structural analysis of
the 3.4-Å map with C3 imposed symmetry after refinement from a subset of ~82,000 S trimer
particles showing adequate orientation sampling (Fig. S1). The local resolution varies in our map
(Fig. 1e); the densities at the utmost surface of the protein have a much lower resolution than the
central region (Fig. 1e), which could be attributed to the inherent flexibility of the distal ends of
glycans. Compared to the map of the purified S ectodomain, our map has more extended density
without recognizable secondary structure element features pointing toward the viral membrane
(Fig. 1e). The detection of this feature likely benefits from the direct picking of S trimer anchored
in the lipid envelope of native virions, stabilizing the stem region that otherwise disassembles in
the purified S ectodomains.
Because of the high feature similarity of our map and that determined from the biochemically
purified S ectodomain (Walls et al. 2016), we fit the published model (PDB ID: 5SZS) to our 3.44

Å map and refined it including the glycans (see Methods). The quality of the refined model was
validated by MolProbity (Chen et al. 2010) (Table S1), correlation between the map and model,
and Q-score analysis per residue (Pintilie et al. 2020) (Fig. 2). The density map of our structure is
better resolved at many regions relative to the previous structure (PDB ID: 5SZS), including
glycans (Fig. 3), which were previously interpreted with accompanied mass spectroscopy
measurements (Walls et al. 2016). Superimposition of our model and 5SZS yields 804 pruned
atom pairs matched with 1.28-Å RMSD, indicating their high structural similarity. Structural
comparisons based on individual domains also show similar results. These domains include
domain 0, domain A, domain B (also known as RBD), domain C, and domain D, with the RMSD
ranging from 0.29 Å to 0.90 Å. As shown in Fig. 1 and 2, each of the three receptor-binding
domains (RBDs) within the S trimer is pointed downwards. Notably, heterogeneous refinement
and 3D variability did not reveal alternative RBD conformations, implying that the native S trimer
proteins on the virion are predominantly in a fully closed state, consistent with the previous report
of purified HCoV-NL63 S ectodomain (Walls et al. 2016).
Since glycosylation of S plays an important role in the viral life cycle and immune-evasion
(Casalino et al. 2020; Vigerust & Shepherd 2007; Watanabe et al. 2019, 2020), we further
investigated the glycosylation sites in our map by computing a difference map between our map
and the map of biochemically purified S (EMD-8331). All glycosylation sites previously identified
by a combination of cryo-EM densities protruding from the expected amino acid side chains and
mass spectroscopy (Table 1 and Table S2) (Walls et al. 2016) were found in our map and
annotated in yellow (Fig. 3) as in (EMD-8331). Two other N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn24
and Asn203 in domain 0), predicted to exist from their sequence but not found by Mass
Spectroscopy or in the map of (Walls et al. 2016), as well as one O-linked glycosylation site
(Ser496 in domain B), were newly identified in our density map (Fig. 3, Table 1). In addition, we
noted extended densities at several glycosylation sites shown in the difference map (annotated in
green, Fig. 3) between our structure and the previously published one, possibly due to the
differences in glycosylation patterns across species (Walls et al. 2016). In our study the virus was
grown in mammalian cells, while the previous study used S ectodomain expressed in insect cells.
N-linked glycosylation in mammalian cells typically results in complex-type glycans with two to
four branches extended from the tri-mannosyl core. In contrast, glycosylation in insect cells

typically yields truncated or paucimannosidic or oligomannosidic glycans, with few if any
complex-type glycans (Tomiya et al. 2004). Overall there is significant agreement between in-situ
and biochemically purified S protein structure, with some notable differences in glycan densities.
Our structure cross-validates the conformation of the spike protein of HCoV-NL63 determined
from either the biochemically purified specimen or the intact virions by cryo-EM.
Compared to the S1 protein of betacoronavirus (i.e. SARS-CoV-2), HCoV-NL63 S1 has an
additional N-terminal domain (domain 0) that is assumed to be a gene duplication of domain A
and is a canonical feature of alphacoronaviruses. Domain B (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 transitions
between upward (open) and downward (closed) conformations due to its inherent flexibility, the
viral receptor ACE2 is able to sample the RBD’s up conformation to initiate virus-receptor binding.
In contrast, domain B of HCoV-NL63 interacts with domain A, therefore being stabilized in a
closed “circle” of HCoV-NL63 S1 (Fig. 4a). The interface area between domain A and B is ~500
Å2 and involves 22 hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 4b) according to PDBsum structure
bioinformatics analysis (Laskowski et al. 2018). The three receptor binding motifs (RBMs) on
HCoV-NL63 RBD are consequently buried in the interface between domain A and domain B, and
prevented from binding to the viral receptor ACE2 (Wu et al. 2009). There must exist a mechanism
to induce some conformational change to release the RBMs from domain A to allow receptor
binding. It was reported that HCoV-NL63 utilizes heparan sulfate proteoglycans as the attachment
factor before binding to ACE2 for virus entry (Milewska et al. 2014, 2018). Whether heparan
sulfate binding to HCoV-NL63 S1 or other factors induce conformational changes to release
RBMs for ACE2 binding warrants further studies.
S proteins of coronaviruses require protease cleavage to release the fusion peptide that inserts into
the target membrane to initiate membrane fusion for virus entry. We compared HCoV-NL63 and
SARS-CoV-2 S2 fusion machineries by superimposing their structures together and excellent
agreement was observed (Fig. 4c). In both structures, the S2’ loop where the host protease cleavage
site is located is almost perpendicular to the central helix, protruding at the peripheral of the S
trimer and readily accessible to host proteases. The fusion machineries of HCoV-NL63 and SARSCoV-2 are almost identical except that the S2’ trigger loop of HCoV-NL63 forms a short alpha
helix before looping back to connect to the fusion peptide while the corresponding loop of SARS-

CoV-2 is long and flexible. The fusion machinery of coronaviruses provides a potential target for
broad anti-coronavirus therapeutics development.
The feasibility of solving the near-atomic resolution structure of membrane-anchored S trimer on
the purified viral particle opens a straightforward path for follow-up structural studies of
coronaviruses with external reagents like receptors, antibodies or drugs. In addition, the single
particle cryo-EM derived structures can be used together with subtomogram averages of the S
trimer in the virion to understand complex and heterogeneous modes of interactions between S
and various external reagents in different biochemical conditions, and the orientation in 3D of S
with respect to the viral membrane, and, ultimately, the cell surface. Such a hybrid approach across
different imaging protocols will be very useful for the discovery of authentic structural states of
molecular components in a pleomorphic virus particle in the context of pathogenesis relevant to
human health.
Methods
Cell culture and Virus
Vero E6 (ATCC CRL-1586) and MA104 (ATCC CRL-2378.1) cells were maintained at 37°C in
a fully humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in DMEM (Invitrogen) and M199 (Gibco) medium
respectively. All culture media were supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin and 10% FBS
(Hyclone). HCoV-NL63 was obtained from BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: Human Coronavirus,
NL63, NR-470.
Virus production and purification
Monolayers of Vero E6 or MA-104 cells were infected with HCoV-NL63 at MOI 0.5. Culture
supernatants were harvested when clear cytopathic effect (CPE) developed. After clarification of
the supernatants through a 0.45 micron filter, the virus was pelleted down through a 20% sucrose
cushion. Virus was then resuspended in NTE buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA) before layered onto 2 ml of 60% OptiPrep (Sigma-Aldrich) and spun at 50,000 x g for 1.5
hour using a SW28 rotor. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatants were removed to leave 4 ml
above the virus band. The remaining 4 ml supernatant, the virus band and the underlay of 2 ml of
60% OptiPrep were mixed to reach a final concentration of 20% OptiPrep. The mixture was spun

at 360,000 x g for 3.5 hours with a NVT65.2 rotor. The virus band was extracted and buffer
exchanged to the NTE buffer using an Amicon Ultra-2 Centrifugal Filter Unit with Ultracel-100
membrane (Millipore).
Cryo-EM vitrification, data acquisition, image processing, and 3D reconstruction
Three microliters of purified HCoV-NL63 virions (4.5 mg/mL) were first applied to 300-mesh
R2/1 + 2 nm C-film grids (Quantifoil) that had been glow-discharged for 15s PELCO easiGlow
(TED PELLA, INC.). Grids were then front-blotted for 2 seconds in a 90% humidified chamber
and vitrified using the LEICA EM GP automated plunge freezing device. Frozen grids were then
stored in liquid nitrogen until imaging. The samples were imaged in a Titan Krios cryo-electron
microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 kV with GIF energy filter (BioQuantum,
Gatan) at a magnification of 64,000× (corresponding to a calibrated sampling of 1.4 Å per pixel).
Micrographs were recorded by EPU software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a Gatan K3 Summit
direct electron detector, where each image was composed of 30 individual frames with an exposure
time of 3 s and an exposure rate of 16 electrons per second per Å2. A total of 4,138 movie stacks
were collected. All movie stacks were motion-corrected by MotionCor2 (Zheng et al. 2017).
Motion-corrected micrographs were imported into cryoSPARC for image processing. The contrast
transfer function (CTF) was determined using the “Patch CTF Estimation” option, and the
micrographs with “CTF fit < 5 Å” were selected using the “Manually Curate Exposures”. Then
157 particles were manually picked and subjected to 2D classification into 10 classes, 3 of which
were selected as the template for the auto-particle picking, yielding 944,822 particles. Several
rounds of 2D classification were then performed to remove the poor 2D class averages, and
300,236 particles were obtained. The initial map was built using ab-initio reconstruction without
any symmetry applied. Next, three rounds of heterogeneous refinement were performed to further
remove bad particles. The final 3D non-uniform refinement was performed using the selected
82,030 particles with or without C3 symmetry applied, and a 3.4-Å map and a 3.7-Å map were
obtained, respectively. Resolution for the final maps was estimated with the 0.143 criterion of the
Fourier shell correlation curve. Resolution map was calculated in cryoSPARC using the “Local
Resolution Estimation” option. The figures were prepared using UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al.
2004) or UCSF Chimera X (Goddard et al. 2018).

Model building
One protomer was first computationally extracted (Pintilie et al. 2010) from the 3.4-Å cryo-EM
map of the spike protein expressed on HCoV-NL63 coronavirus. The PDB coordinates of
biochemically purified HCoV-NL63 spike protein (PDB ID: 5SZS) were then docked into the
computationally extracted S protomer map. Residues 883-889 and 993-1000 that were previously
unresolved were modeled using SWISS-MODEL (Waterhouse et al. 2018). The resultant model
was refined using phenix.real_space_refine (Adams et al. 2012) and manually optimized with Coot
(Emsley et al. 2010). The atomic model of protomer was then fitted into the cryo-EM density of
the other protomers in the HCoV-NL63 spike trimer using Chimera (Pettersen et al. 2004),
followed by the optimization of the whole model with phenix.real_space_refine. The glycans in
the PDB ID: 5SZS model were also used in our model for refinement. The final model was
evaluated by MolProbity (Chen et al. 2010) and Q-scores (Pintilie et al. 2020). Statistics of the
map reconstruction and model optimization are shown in Table S1. All figures were prepared using
Chimera (Pettersen et al. 2004) or Chimera X (Goddard et al. 2018).
