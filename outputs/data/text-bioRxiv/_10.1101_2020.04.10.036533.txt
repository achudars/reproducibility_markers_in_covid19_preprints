Abstract

18

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an urgent global public health emergency and

19

warrants investigating molecular and structural studies addressing the dynamics of viral

20

proteins involved in host cell adhesion. The recent comparative genomic studies highlight

21

the insertion of Furin protease site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein alerting possible

22

modification in the viral spike protein and its eventual entry to host cell and presence of Furin

23

site implicated to virulence. Here we structurally show how Furin interacts with the SARS-

24

CoV-2 spike glycoprotein homotrimer at S1/S2 region, which underlined the mechanism and

25

mode of action, which is a key for host cell entry. Unravelling the structural features of

26

biding site opens the arena in rising bonafide antibodies targeting to block the Furin cleavage

27

and have great implications in the development of Furin inhibitors or therapeutics.

Introduction

30

The pandemic Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute

31

Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an urgent public health emergency

32

and made a serious impact on global health and economy (1). To date, more than 86,000

33

deaths and 1.5 million confirmed positive cases were reported globally, making the most

34

contagious pandemic in the last decade (www.coronavirus.gov). Since the initial reports on

35

this pneumonia-causing novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China , mortality and

36

morbidity are increasing exponentially around the globe despite several antiviral and

37

antibody treatments (2). Most available neutralising antibodies in use are targeting the SARS-

38

CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which is essential for host cell adhesion via ACE2 and CD26

39

receptors (3, 4), but infection control is still insignificant. Meanwhile, several antiviral drugs

40

(Ritonavir, Lopinavir, Chloroquine, Remdesivir and others) targeting different host and viral

41

proteins are been clinically evaluating and repurposing to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection (2,

42

5). With the drastic increasing number of the positive cases around the world (www.cdc.gov),

43

moderate response to antivirals under clinical trials and poor response to antibodies targeting

44

spike SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is a serious concern and warrants detail understanding

45

of the molecular and structural features of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins in native

46

condition and post-viral infection. This will abet in understanding the dynamics and

47

mechanism of viral action on the human cell.

48
49

In this regard, several epidemiological and evolutionary reports have highlighted the

50

several unique sequence deletions and insertions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome compare to

51

previous known SARS and Bat coronavirus (6, 7). Among the various genetic variations,

52

insertion of Furin protease cleavage site in the spike glycoprotein (aa682 – aa689) is

53

strikingly novel in SARS-CoV-2 (4, 8) and has not been found in other related coronaviruses

54

(SARS-CoV-1, Bat-CoV, Pangolin) (MERS contain pseudo binding site) (Fig. S1A). Furin

55

protease belongs to the family of calcium (Ca2+)-dependent proprotein/prohormone

56

convertase (PCs) which is ubiquitously expressed in humans but its levels are elevated lung

57

cystic fibrosis (9). Furin protease also cycles from trans-Golgi network (TGN) to cell

58

membrane (virus attaches) and endosomes (virus translocate in endosomes). Interestingly,

59

Furin and other related proteases are highly specific and known for cleaving different viral

60

(Influenza, HIV) envelope glycoproteins, thereby enhancing viral fusion with the host cell

61

membrane (10). Furthermore, Furin preferentially recognizes the motif R-X-K/R-R and

62

cleaves the peptide in the presence of Ca2+, which is physiologically connected to different

63

viral infections (10, 11). However, about SARS-CoV-2, it is elusive that how Furin could

64

bind and act on the viral spike glycoprotein. Hence to understand the interaction mode and

65

mechanism of Furin action over the spike glycoprotein warrants further structural and

66

biomolecular studies.

69

Considering the current public health crisis and to better understand the structural and

70

molecular mode of interactions between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human Furin, we

71

resolve the structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in complex with Furin protease via

72

molecular dynamics and simulations. Unfortunately, the only two available SARS-CoV-2

73

spike glycoprotein Cryo-EM structures (PDB: 6VSB and 6VXX) are incomplete and has

74

several gaps in the built structure and also lacks the structure for Furin cleavage sites (3, 12).

75

As these EM structures built on molecular replacement with SARS-CoV-1 (PDB: 6ACG),

76

Furin cleavage sites in the spike protein is flexible and novel insertion only in the SARS-

77

CoV-2, the EM structures lack this important region. Hence, for the molecular dynamics and

78

simulation studies, we directed to use previously published and validated model structure of

79

full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (4) and published structure of human Furin

80

(PDB: 1P8J or 1JXH) (11). The RMSD of the previously published model structure and

81

Cryo-EM structure was 0.84, which suggests overall structural accuracy even with the

82

presence of Furin cleavage sites. The binding free energies were taken into consideration for

83

selecting the best possible model. Further validation and refinement was completed by

84

ensuring that the residues occupied Ramachandran favoured positions using Coot (www.mrc-

85

imb.cam.uk/). The final complex structure was then compared with the initial Furin structure

86

and their overall RMSD was found to be 0.28 Å for Ca atoms.

87
88

Results

89

The overall complex structure shows three Furin proteases binding to the mid or

90

equatorial region (mid region of S1 and S2 domain (S1/S2)) of SARS-CoV-2 spike

91

glycoprotein homo-trimer at the off-centric and adjacent side of spike trimer (Fig. 1 and

92

S1B). The binding Furin proteases adopt a clamp-like fashion, where it clips to the cleavage

93

site of the spike glycoprotein. Furthermore, the binding of Furin protease creates a large

94

burred interface of ~1,100Å2 (~368Å2/Furin) between the proteins, as calculated from the

95

PISA server (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/). This suggests a bonafide and tight

96

interaction of Furin protease over the spike glycoprotein and Furin. The depth, shape and

97

charge of Furin protease are well known and it has canyon-like crevice and its active site

98

pocket is conserved in many species and the catalytic or substrate-binding pocket is made of

99

key amino acid residues R185, M189, D191, N192, R193, E229, V231, D233, D259, K261,

100

R298, W328 and Q346 (10, 11) (Fig. 2 and S2). Interestingly, these residues are also well-

101

positioned to interact with the viral spike protein cleavage site in our complex structure and

102

the entire substrate-binding pocket of Furin protease appears like a canyon-like crevice,

103

which can accommodate a large portion of target protein/peptide. The results show that the

104

SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein amino acid residues N657 to Q690 are the prime interacting

105

residues with the Furin protease. The position and orientation of these unique residues

106

involved in Furin recognition are well exposed and organise in a flexible loop. The spike

107

protein residues N657, N658, E661, Y660, T678, N679, S680, R682, R683, R685, S689,

108

Q690 makes the strong interaction with the Furin protease (Fig. 2A). The interaction between

109

the viral spike glycoprotein and Furin protease is mediated via several van der Waals or by

110

hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, the entire cleavage loop of viral spike protein fits into the

111

canyon-like substrate-binding pocket of Furin protease. It is quite interesting to notice that

112

none of the previously known coronaviruses had this novel Furin protease cleavage site in the

113

spike glycoprotein, which accentuates the novelty and uniqueness of SARS-CoV-2. In

114

addition, previous reports on the glycosylation of spike glycoprotein show that Furin

115

cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is not targeted by the glycosylation,

116

hence this cleavage loop is completely solvent-exposed (4). This further corroborates the

117

potential attack of Furin protease over the S1/S2 cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike

118

glycoprotein. Based on the Furin binding mode and structural interaction, we propose the

119

following supposition. The binding and cleaving (priming) the spike glycoprotein at S1/S2

120

region by Furin protease might cut the spike glycoprotein into N-terminal S1 domain

121

involved in host cell recognition and C-terminal S2 membrane-anchored domain involved in

122

host cell penetration and entry, thus making the SARS-CoV-2 highly virulent. In support of

123

this supposition, it is evident in infectious bronchitis virus that presence of Furin cleavage site

124

has pronounced virulence suggesting Furin cleavage increase the virulence (13).

125
126
127

Discussion:

128

Based on this enzyme cleavage action and separation of N- and C- terminal domain of

129

spike glycoproteins also could make the ACE2 and CD26 inhibitors of least effective, as

130

upon cleavage the N-terminal S1 domains are not required for the cell penetration. This also

131

raises a caution that while making neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike

132

glycoprotein, these cleavage activities need to be considered. Hence, we speculate that

133

antibodies against S2 domain and drugs targeting S1 trimerization could be more promising.

134

These observations and structure-guided molecular interaction with novel Furin protease

135

guide us to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 have different infection modes with that of earlier

136

known coronaviruses. Repurposing and developing targets (inhibitors and peptide) to block

the Furin protease found to be another potential therapeutic option and also warrant clinical

138

investigation. This study also first to show structurally that how the human Furin interacts

139

with the coronavirus spike glycoprotein, which underlines its mechanism of action. This

140

structural and molecular dynamics study has great implications to further develop Furin

141

protease inhibitors to block the protease activity of Furin and also abet in the development of

142

bonafide antibodies targeting the S1/S2 Furin cleavage site of spike glycoprotein and

143

accenture the development of future therapeutics.
