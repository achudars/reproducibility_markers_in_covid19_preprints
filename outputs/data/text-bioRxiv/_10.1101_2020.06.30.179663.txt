Abstract

SARS-CoV-2, a highly transmittable pathogen has infected over 3.8 million people around the
globe. The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 engages host ACE2 for adhesion, TMPRSS2
for activation and entry. With the aid of whole-exome sequencing, we report a variant
rs12329760 in TMPRSS2 gene and its mutant V160M, which might impede viral entry.
Furthermore, we identified TMPRSS2 cleavage sites in S2 domain of spike glycoprotein and
report the structure of TMPRSS2 in complex with spike glycoprotein. We also report the
structures of protease inhibitors in complex with TMPRSS2, which could hamper the
interaction with spike protein. These findings advance our understanding on the role of
TMPRSS2 and in the development of potential therapeutics.

Introduction
The pandemic COVID-19 caused by a highly transmittable pathogen SARS-CoV-2, has
infected millions of people worldwide1,2. To date, it has infected more than 3.8 million people
resulting in ~265,000 deaths with varied incidence and mortality rates across the globe5. The
USA and European countries recorded a large number of infections associated with higher
mortality compared to Asian countries. These variations could be due to differences in the
virulence, pathogenicity of viral strains and host factors including genetic makeup.

SARS-CoV-2 use Spike glycoprotein for host cells adhesion. The N-terminal S1subunit
interact with receptor ACE2 It is also known that SARS-CoV-2 S-protein gets activated
through host proteases7,8. Evidences have also shown that corona viruses S proteins are cleaved
by host cell proteases such as furin at S1/S2 cleavage site exposing S2 to serine protease
TMPRSS2 to activate fusion of membranes for viral entry7,12. However, lack of structural and
molecular studies concerning TMPRSS2 interaction with S-protein limits our understanding of
key priming action of TMPRSS2 for the host cell entry of the S-protein, which has great
therapeutic implications.

Here, with the aid of whole exome sequencing we discover and report the functionally relevant
variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human genome that contribute to differences in COVID-19
infection rates. By employing structural mutation studies, molecular dynamics we show this
variant V160M decreased stability, with a plausible role in viral entry. Furthermore, for the
first time we demonstrate the structural interactions between TMPRSS2 and S2 subunit of
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We also report the structural interactions of clinically approved
protease inhibitors to block the TMPRSS2 and its further interaction with S2 subunit of spike
protein establish the specificity and precision.
Methods
Study subjects and Ethics
The study group were recruited after obtaining informed consent and the study protocol was
approved by Institutional ethics committee. Whole blood (3ml) was collected from 547 healthy
individuals from the general population of Indian ethnicity. Whole exome data was generated
for 20 individuals. Variants identified in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were replicated in 159 and 500
individuals respectively as shown in Supplementary Fig. S6. The study subjects were
considered healthy based on no self-reported disease, normal BMI, ultrasound, laboratory
parameters and were found to be clinically healthy.

DNA Isolation, Whole exome sequencing, genotyping in healthy individuals and insilico
analysis
DNA was isolated from whole blood and Complete exonic regions were amplified and
sequenced on the Next generation sequencer (Ion Proton; Life technologies, USA).
Functionally relevant variants were identified using Polyphen and SIFT scores. Genotypes
were interpreted using Genome Lab GeXP software (v10.2). All the protocols conformed to
standard kit instructions and the methodology is given in Supplementary information.

Structural modelling of TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein trimer
To better understand the structure of TMPRSS2, including the position and organization of the
catalytic site for substrate processing, we modelled the monomer structure of human TMPRSS2
employing SWISS-MODEL and I-TASSER. The structure ensure all residues are placed in
Ramachandran favored positions using Coot (www.mrc-imb.cam.uk/) and validated the model.
we used a previously published and validated model structure of full length SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein19.

Molecular docking of activated form of SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein and TMPRSS2
Molecular docking with HADDOCK 2.2 and Cluspro , interaction studies were performed
with the activated form (post furin cleavage) of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S2 domain)
and our modelled and validated TMPRSS2 (aa145-aa492) as template structures. The binding
free energies were taken into consideration for selecting the best possible models. Ensured the
residues occupied Ramachandran favored positions using Coot (www.mrc-imb.cam.uk/). The
final model of complex structure of activated SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein homotrimer and
TMPRSS2 was visualized in PyMol.

Molecular Docking and dynamics of TMPRSS2 inhibitors and structure refinement
TMPRSS2 and potent protease inhibitors (Chemostat, Upmoastat, Nafamostat and Bromhexine
hydrochloride) were docked and simulated individually for molecular docking and dynamics
studies. Both protein and protease inhibitors were prepared for docking by ensuring the
presence of all hydrogen atoms and water molecules at least 5 Å around the binding site or
catalytic pocket using the Mastero package program34. Binding is corroborated based on the
Solvent accessibility surface area (SASA), C-Score (confidence score) and Z- score (clash
score). Further jelly body refinement was done in the CCP4 program suite35 and then Coot

(www.mrc-imb.cam.uk/) to ensure appropriate docking and no steric hindrance clashes in the
side chain residues. Binding free energies were taken into consideration for selecting the best
possible docked site.

Results
Exome Data identifies functionally relevant variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2
Whole exome sequencing on Next generation sequencer yielded 6.5-7.5 GB data and ~56,000
variants per sample across the genome. We identified 3 variants in ACE2 and 9 in TMPRSS2
applying relevant filters (Fig. 1). Of these 12 variants, rs971249 in ACE2 and rs12329760 in
TMPRSS2 genes were replicated. The minor allele frequency for the TMPRSS2 variant was
0.22, and ACE2 variant was 0.3.

Allelic frequency of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 variants
To compare the allelic frequencies of Indians with other ethnicities we sequenced the flanking
regions of the variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the study subjects. A representative
electropherogram for TMPRSS2 genotypes is shown (Fig. 1) The minor allele frequency (MAF)
of the ACE2 variant (rs971249-T) was 0.24 and TMPRSS2 variant (rs12329760-T) was 0.27.
the TMPRSS2 variant was noted between ethnicities (USA, Europe Vs India; Z score= -2.08;
p=0.03).

Structure of TMPRSS2 and catalytic site
The overall structure of TMPRSS2 (aa145-aa492) (Fig. 2a) measures 42 Å in length and 24 Å
in diameter comprising an N-terminal (aa145-aa243) activation domain and C-terminal (aa256aa492) proteolytic or catalytic domain. We mapped the catalytic site/pocket of TMPRSS2,
where residues H296, S441, K432, W461 and Q438 are found to be highly conserved with
other TTPs (type II transmembrane serine proteases).

Identification of TMPRSS2 binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and
structure of activated S-protein
Based on available literature addressing the serine protease target sites we mapped two
potential TMPRSS2 binding sites in S-protein (T1: aa837 to aa 845 and T2: aa 976 to aa986)
located in the S2 domain region (Fig. 3). The structure of S-proteins with S1 and S2 domains
are shown in (Fig. 3b).

V160M decreases the stability of TMPRSS2
The TMPRSS2 variant (rs12329760) and the current epidemiological reports showing lower
SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in the Indian ethnic background raises an intriguing question about

its correlation with the infection. Valine 160 in the wild-type protein (V160) is located in the
N-terminal SRCS domain (scavenger receptor cysteine rich) and is paired with the three antiparallel β-sheets (aa145-aa170), Structurally the replacement of V160M does not
accommodate the Met due to the topology and charge limit (Fig. 4a,). We performed molecular
dynamics and simulation studies to know mutant protein characteristics and found undergone
structural deformation due to the complete shift in the motif (Fig.4c,). This is corroborated with
the overall increase in the B-factor (stability factor) of TMPRSS2 with V160M mutation. (Fig.
4 e, f). These observations reiterate that the V160M variant of TMPRSS2 decreases the stability
of the protein.

mutant structure of TMPRSS2. The difference in the domain oscillation and structural change
is marked in red dashed box.
Structural interactions in the activated SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein - TMPRSS2 complex
We have observed TMPRSS2 potentially interacting with the T1 and T2 sites of the S2 domain
of spike glycoprotein. The overall complex structure shows that TMPRSS2 binds to T1 site of
SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein homo-trimer and adopts typical protease binding mode and
interacts with a higher affinity (-250 kcal). This suggests a bonafide and tight interaction of
TMPRSS2 protease with the spike glycoprotein. The active or catalytic pocket of TMPRSS2
is made of residues Q276, H296, E299, K300, P301, K340, K342, E389, K390, L419, S441,
Q438 and W461. And the residues H296, S441, K432 and Q438 are highly conserved among
several serine proteases. The TMPRSS2 catalytic pocket of a cup-like architecture
accommodates and interacts with the linker region connecting α1/α2 and α3/α4 of S2 domain
of the spike protein Fig. 5a, 5b. With respect to TMPRSS2 interaction with T2 site of activated
S2 domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, the extended and well-exposed loop region
(G832 to N856) adopts the peptide binding mode with the TMPRSS2. The entire “S-shape”
loop region of T2 site (K835 to I850) of S2 domain pass into the canyon-like crevice or cuplike structure of TMPRSS2 catalytic pocket (Fig. 5d) Among them, residues K835, Y837,
D839, C840, L841, D843, I844, R847, R848 are the key interacting residues and also well
positioned towards the catalytic pocket of the TMPRSS2 (Fig. 5 e).

Structure of TMPRSS2 in complex with clinically approved protease inhibitors
To explore the specificity and validate the precision of the catalytic pocket we performed
molecular docking, refinement and dynamic studies with four potential TMPRSS2 protease
inhibitors (Chemostat, Upamostat, Nafmostat and Bromhexine hydrochloride) (Fig. 6 a-f). As
expected we observed the specific binding location of all drugs directed to the catalytic pocket
of TMPRSS2. The main drug binding region is structurally linked with the binding of T1 and
T2 sites of the S2 domain of spike glycol proteins with binding energy of -9 kCal.

We next analyzed interactions of individual drugs with TMPRSS2 catalytic pocket of active
residues Q276, H296, E299, K300, P301, K340, K342, E389, K390, L419, S441, Q438 and
W461. It was interesting to notice that all four inhibitors (Chemostat, Upamostat, Nafamostat
and Bromhexine hydrochloride) predominantly bind to the specific location of the TMPRSS2
catalytic pocket. The detailed position and alignment of amino acids of TMPRSS2 and
individual drugs involved in the interaction are showed in Fig. 7.

Discussion
We identified a missense variant rs12329760 in TMPRSS2 gene that is shown to confer
decreased stability of the protein. From the homology model of TMPRSS2 and its mutant
V160M, we have identified its interaction sites with SARS-CoV-2 S-protein for the first time.
Binding of clinically proven protease inhibitors with precision and specificity at these
interaction sites suggest that this site can be targeted for developing newer drugs in the
treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and till then these drugs can be tested on patients
therapeutically in current COVID clinics.

It is intriguing to note that, although the viral strain emerged from China and spread to various
regions of the world, significant differences in the incidence and mortality rates cannot be
completely explained by the various quasi-sub species of the virus. This suggests that the host
factors ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2, play a role in the infection. Significant differences
(p=0.03) in allelic frequency of TMPRSS2 variant across ethnicities (MAF and variant carriers
0.27; 44.60% in Indians, 0.22; 36.26% in Europeans, 0.15;28.24% in Americans), indicate its
role in varied infectivity. The identified variant rs12329760; V160M in TMPRSS2 gene was
earlier reported to have a higher risk of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in prostate cancer patients18. It
also gains importance as it is known to be present in an exonic splicing enhancer site (Srp40)
that is associated with an increased chance of exon skipping or malformation of the protein due
to potential exonic splicing enhancer site disruption 13,14. Hence, we believe that the presence
of unstable protein in the variant carriers might hamper the entry of the virus in to the host.
Despite knowing the role of TMPRSS2 in priming of S-protein for host cell entry, its structure
and interaction sites with the S-protein are not elucidated. Also the fact that a deleterious variant
in TMPRSS2 gene is identified in healthy individuals, we wanted to discern its position in
relation to the activation site employing a validated homology model. To understand the
structure/functional relevance of the variant in TMPRSS2, the precise location of the variant on
the protein was explored. This predicted and validated model was important because the
structure for TMPRSS2 protease was not available in PDB and none of the previous studies
demonstrated the protease cleavage sites.The homology model clearly demonstrates that the
variant V160M is in the N-terminal domain (aa145-aa243) towards cell membrane away from
catalytic and C-terminal domain (aa256-aa492) located outwards.

We have also identified the interactions of TMPRSS2 with spike glycoprotein using the above
model in complex with the validated model structure of full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.30.179663; this version posted June 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

glycoprotein19 as the available structures with PDB lack Furin and TMPRSS2 recognition and
cleavage sites 11. Based on available literature on the target sites of other serine proteases 20,21
along with sequence analysis, we identified two prime TMPRSS2 recognition sites in the
SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. The two identified sites span a part of heptad region1 (HR1)
of six helix bundle of SARS-CoV-2 near the fusion peptide. Recently it is reported that heptad
regions HR1 and HR2 aid in bringing the fusion peptide in close proximity to transmembrane
domain facilitating membrane fusion22-24. It is convincing to speculate that Furin protease acts
first on the spike glycoprotein at S1/S2 region and cleaves the spike protein to S1 (ACE2 and
CD26 binding region) and S2 (trimerization domain) resulting in the complete exposure of S2
domain and TMPRSS2 recognition sites as elucidated earlier 12,25.

While this model fits well for the normal genotype of TMPRSS2, whether genetic variant in
TMPRSS2 protease has any physiological role in SARS-CoV-2 infection or activation of spike
glycoprotein is elusive. Insilico studies suggested decreased stability of the protein in variant,
as the free energy change is less than -0.5 k cal/mol, and is present in an important domain of
the protein 15,26. Molecular dynamics simulation confirm structural distortions due to complete
shift in the motif leading to changes in quaternary structure of the protein and concomitant
increase in B factor with V160M variant. This reiterates the fact that although the V160M is
not located in the catalytic pocket of TMPRSS2, decrease in the stability of the protein might
hamper SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, however, this needs to be confirmed.

In order to assess the binding efficiency of TMPRSS2 with identified cleavage sites on S2
subunit of Spike protein, we tested the clinically proven protease inhibitors: Camostat,
Nafamostat, Upamostat and Bromhexine hydrochloride (BHH). Camostat used therapeutically,
for unrelated clinical conditions was shown to inhibit influenza viral replication27,28 while
Nafamostat is a potent inhibitor of MERS S-protein mediated membrane fusion 29. BHH on the
other hand is FDA approved mucolytic agent and a specific inhibitor of TMPRSS2

30,31

.

Upamostat is another serine protease inhibitor under consideration for clinical trials 32. All four
drugs bind to the active site of TMPRSS2 with high precision and specificity (Fig. 5 and
Supplementary Fig. S5). We demonstrate that Camostat, Upamostat and BHH preferentially
bind to a specific location at the catalytic pocket of TMPRSS2, while Nafamostat binds to 3
additional binding residues in two modes.Furthermore, these potential TMPRSS2 inhibitors
also share their interaction via several polar, charged and hydrophobic interactions
(Supplementary Fig. S5). The specific binding of these drugs with high precision confirms that

they could potentially bind and impede the interaction between the spike glycoprotein and
TMPRSS2. This study identified the interaction sites of the drugs with TMPRSS2 and
therefore, this conserved epitope can be targeted for developing vaccines and therapeutic drugs.
Based on these findings we propose a model of interaction of TMPRSS2 with S2 subunit of
spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 Fig. 8. Limitation of this study is that we have not shown the
association of V160M variant with infectivity in COVID-19 patients and instability of the
protein is shown by in silico approaches. Further studies are needed in COVID-19 patients to
explore the association and functional assays to gain mechanical insights on the role of the
variant.

As in other human diseases, the incidence, severity, progression and therapeutic response have
a genetic predisposition, susceptibility to COVID-19 may also have a predisposition. Although
age, sex and comorbidities are shown to associate with varied incidence and severity of the
disease, host genetic predisposition has not been explored. This study reports for the first time
host factor genetics, molecular structure of TMPRSS2 and its cleavage sites on S2 subunit of
spike glycoprotein. It is interesting to note that a significant proportion are variant carriers in
India with lesser incidence of COVID-19 as compared to other ethnicities including USA and
European countries that have a lower variant carriers with higher incidence. While we report
the importance of host genetic factors for the first time, COVID-19 host genetics initiative
(https://www.covid19hg.org/) reiterate the need to study the role of human genome in
explaining COVID-19 severity and susceptibility.
