ABSTRACT

41

The nasal-mucosa constitutes the primary entry site for respiratory viruses including

42

SARS-CoV-2. While the imbalanced innate immune response of end-stage COVID-

43

19 has been extensively studied, the earliest stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the

44

mucosal entry site have remained unexplored. Here we employed SARS-CoV-2 and

45

influenza virus infection in native multi-cell-type human nasal turbinate and lung

46

tissues ex vivo, coupled with genome-wide transcriptional analysis, to investigate

47

viral susceptibility and early patterns of local-mucosal innate immune response in the

48

authentic milieu of the human respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 productively infected

49

the nasal turbinate tissues, predominantly targeting respiratory epithelial cells, with

50

rapid increase in tissue-associated viral sub-genomic mRNA, and secretion of

51

infectious viral progeny. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered robust antiviral

52

and inflammatory innate immune responses in the nasal mucosa. The upregulation

53

of interferon stimulated genes, cytokines and chemokines, related to interferon

54

signaling and immune-cell activation pathways, was broader than that triggered by

55

influenza virus infection. Conversely, lung tissues exhibited a restricted innate

56

immune response to SARS-CoV-2, with a conspicuous lack of type I and III

57

interferon upregulation, contrasting with their vigorous innate immune response to

58

influenza virus. Our findings reveal differential tissue-specific innate immune

59

responses in the upper and lower respiratory tract, that are distinct to SARS-CoV-2.

60

The studies shed light on the role of the nasal-mucosa in active viral transmission

61

and immune defense, implying a window of opportunity for early interventions,

62

whereas the restricted innate immune response in early-SARS-CoV-2-infected lung

63

tissues could underlie the unique uncontrolled late-phase lung damage of advanced

64

COVID-19.

IMPORTANCE

66

In order to reduce the late-phase morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, there is a

67

need to better understand and target the earliest stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in

68

the human respiratory tract. Here we have studied the initial steps of SARS-CoV-2

69

infection and the consequent innate immune responses within the natural

70

multicellular complexity of human nasal-mucosal and lung tissues. Comparing the

71

global innate response patterns of nasal and lung tissues, infected in parallel with

72

SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus, we have revealed distinct virus-host interactions in

73

the upper and lower respiratory tract, which could determine the outcome and unique

74

pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies in the nasal-mucosal infection model

75

can be employed to assess the impact of viral evolutionary changes, and evaluate

76

new therapeutic and preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 and other human

77

respiratory pathogens.

INTRODUCTION

82

The ongoing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe

83

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has created an immense

84

global health crisis. While the majority of infections are asymptomatic or cause mild-

85

to-moderate disease, a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients progress over

86

time to display severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome,

87

reflecting extensive late-stage viral- and inflammatory-mediated lung injury (1–5).

88

SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory tract, utilizing the cellular receptor

89

angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and the transmembrane protease serine 2

90

(TMPRSS2), shown to be expressed in respiratory epithelial cells lining the upper

91

and lower airways (6–13).

92

The nose is the main port of entry for SARS-CoV-2. The importance of the nasal

93

mucosa as the initial site for SARS-CoV-2 infection is suggested by the observed

94

sequence of clinical manifestations (proceeding from upper-to-lower respiratory

95

involvement), and the higher expression of ACE2 gene in nasal epithelial cells

96

(compared to lower respiratory airway epithelial cells), paralleled by high infectivity of

97

these cells in vitro (7, 13).

98

Frontline protection against respiratory viral infections is mediated by early local-

99

mucosal innate immune responses, exerting antiviral defense via multiple

100

upregulated interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and cytokines release (14, 15). In the

101

case of SARS-CoV-2, the importance of innate immune defenses in viral control has

102

been highlighted by the finding that inborn defects in innate immunity or the

103

presence of auto-antibodies against interferons are associated with severe COVID-

104

19 (16–18). While the imbalanced innate immune status of end-stage COVID-19,

105

marked by excessive inflammation coupled with impaired interferon production, has

106

been well-characterized (4, 12, 19–21), the earliest innate immune responses to

107

SARS-CoV-2 infection at the nasal mucosal entry site, which could determine the

108

outcome of infection have remained largely unexplored.

109

Controlled infection studies in animal models, although invaluable for testing

110

vaccines and therapeutics, do not reflect the severe form of the disease in humans

111

(22). Studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human airway epithelial cells grown in

112

monolayer cultures and in organoids derived from differentiated lung stem cells have

113

proven instrumental in dissecting the virus biology and cell-type specific interactions

114

(9, 11, 12, 23). However, these models may not recapitulate the tropism of the virus

115

and the host response within authentic multicellular human tissues, that contain a

116

variety of cells of different lineages, as well as extracellular matrix composition -

117

unique to each tissue (24). In this regard, recent work has shown that lung tissue

118

explants can be infected ex vivo with SARS-CoV-2, exhibiting impaired interferon

119

(IFN) response with cytokines induction (25, 26).

120

We have previously reported on the development of ex vivo viral infection models in

121

native three-dimensional human target tissues, maintained viable as multi-cell type

122

organ cultures (27–31). We applied these models for the analysis of viral tropism,

123

mode of spread within the tissue, and innate immune effectors of herpes simplex

124

virus type 1, human cytomegalovirus, and Zika virus (32–35). More recently, we

125

have established a novel ex vivo model of inferior nasal turbinate tissues –

126

representing the respiratory viral mucosal entry site (36).

127

In the present study, we employed ex vivo SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection

128

in native human nasal turbinate and lung tissues, coupled with genome-wide

129

transcriptional analysis, to investigate viral susceptibility and early patterns of local

130

mucosal defense in the authentic respiratory tract milieu. Our findings provide

RESULTS

136

Human nasal turbinate and lung tissues maintained in organ culture are

137

permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection

138

The human nasal turbinates are lined by ciliary respiratory epithelium, covering the

139

lamina propria, populated by stromal cells, blood vessels, glands, and immune cells

140

(36). This tissue represents the upper airway entry site for respiratory viruses

141

including SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, we sought to characterize the susceptibility of

142

the human nasal turbinate tissues, maintained as integral 3D organ cultures, to

143

SARS-CoV-2. We have recently shown that nasal turbinate tissues remain viable

144

and retain their natural histology and functionality, including the continued beating of

145

epithelial cilia, for at least 7 days in culture (36). To further identify tissue-specific

146

and virus-specific aspects of the initial respiratory infection, we have investigated in

147

parallel: 1) SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung tissues, representing the major end-organ

148

site of viral replication and disease [similarly maintained as organ cultures as

149

previously described; (27)], and 2) The susceptibility of the same upper and lower

150

respiratory tract tissues to influenza virus infection.

151

To evaluate the susceptibility of the nasal turbinate and lung tissues to SARS-CoV-2,

152

we first examined the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and the key

153

protease TMPRSS2, needed for proteolytic cleavage of the viral spike protein.

154

Employing confocal microscopy immunofluorescence analysis of whole-mount

155

tissues, we showed the marked expression of both entry factors in the nasal

156

turbinate tissues, and their colocalization pattern with respiratory epithelial cells lining

157

the mucosa (Figure 1A). In line with latest studies (7, 9, 11, 13), we have also shown

158

the presence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins in the lung tissues, and their

159

colocalization with epithelial cells lining the alveolar spaces (Figure 1B).

160

Next, the turbinate organ cultures were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-

161

WA1/2020). At 2, 24, 48, and 72 hours post infection (hpi), the tissues were washed,

162

and collected along with their respective cleared supernatants. Confocal microcopy

163

analysis of whole-mount infected turbinate tissues at 48 hpi showed the presence of

164

infected cells, primarily localized in the respiratory epithelial cell layer (Figure 1C).

165

No viral immune staining was observed in control mock-infected tissues. We

166

monitored the kinetics of viral infection, measuring the accumulation of the viral sub-

167

genomic (sg) mRNA transcribed in the infected tissues, and the progeny virus

168

genomic RNA released from the infected tissues (measured in the respective cleared

169

supernatants) by quantitative real time (RT)-PCR. As shown in Figure 2A, there was

170

a rapid and significant increase in turbinate-tissue-associated viral sg mRNA (>1-

171

log), and in mature progeny viral RNA released from the infected tissues (~2.5-log),

172

both reaching peak levels within 24 hpi, followed by a plateau. Consistent with these

173

findings, peak titers (TCID50) of newly-formed infectious viral progeny were released

174

from infected tissues at 24 hpi, with declining infectious titers at later times (Figure

175

2A). Together, these findings revealed productive SARS-CoV-2 replication in the

176

nasal turbinate cultures, with preferential infection of respiratory epithelial cells.

177

Similar viral replication was demonstrated using a low-passage SARS-CoV-2 clinical

178

isolate (SARS-CoV-2 isolate Israel-Jerusalem-854/2020), isolated from a

179

nasopharyngeal swab specimen (data not shown).

180

In accordance with the presence of viral receptors, we have also demonstrated the

181

active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in ex vivo infected lung tissues (Figures 1D, 2A),

182

showing the widespread distribution of the virus in alveolar epithelial cells throughout

183

the tissue. Comparable overall SARS-CoV-2 infection kinetics were observed in the

184

nasal turbinate and in the lung tissues – as measured by viral RNA synthesis and

185

infectious viral progeny levels over time (Figure 2A).

186

Influenza virus efficiently infects the same human nasal turbinate and lung tissues

187

Influenza virus sialic acid receptors are abundantly expressed in upper and lower

188

respiratory tract epithelial cells (13). To uncover virus-specific patterns of infection

189

and host response, the corresponding tissues from the same donors were infected in

190

parallel with influenza virus A(H1N1) pdm09 (using the same viral inoculum

191

infectious dose). Both the nasal turbinate and the lung tissues were readily infected

192

by influenza virus (Figures 1C,D, 2B). The tissue distribution and respiratory

193

epithelial cell tropism appeared overall comparable to that of SARS-CoV-2, as

194

shown by confocal microscopy analysis (Figure 1C,D). Influenza virus replication and

195

productive infection in the nasal turbinate and lung tissues was demonstrated by the

196

consistent upsurge (~ 2-log) in tissue-associated influenza RNA and in supernatant

197

cell-free influenza virus genomic RNA levels observed at 24 hpi, with further increase

198

through 48-72 hpi. Unlike the decreasing titers of SARS-CoV-2 noted at 48 and 72

199

hpi (see above), increasing titers of infectious influenza virus progeny were

200

consistently released from the infected nasal turbinate and lung tissues through

201

these later times post infection (Figure 2B).

202
203

SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits distinct virus-specific and tissue-specific innate

204

immune response patterns in human nasal turbinate and lung tissues

205

To gain a global insight into the earliest tissue responses to SARS-CoV-2, we

206

employed unbiased genome-wide transcriptome analysis of infected versus mock-

207

infected tissues at 24 hpi. This time point was chosen based on our demonstration

208

that SARS-CoV-2 replication in the tissues already reaches its peak at 24 hpi (see

10

209

Figure 2), and our preliminary RT-PCR analysis of individual cytokines kinetic in

210

SARS-CoV-2- and influenza virus -infected nasal turbinate tissues (data not shown),

211

indicating that the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus in

212

infected tissues is well induced by 24 hpi. We sought to define common versus virus-

213

specific and tissue-specific innate immune response patterns, by comparing the

214

transcriptional response of the nasal turbinate and lung tissues to SARS-CoV-2 and

215

influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 (upon parallel infection of the same tissues, as described

216

above).

217

Transcriptome analysis was carried out independently on 3 nasal tissues and 5 lung

218

tissues (all obtained from different donors) to gain statistical significance. We

219

detected viral gene transcripts representing coverage over the entire viral genome in

220

all infected tissues (data not shown). The percent of viral transcripts (of all the

221

sequence reads in the transcriptome data) was overall comparable upon infection by

222

SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus in both tissues, except for a significantly higher

223

percent of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts reads in the lung tissues compared to the

224

percent of SARS-CoV-2 reads in the nasal turbinate tissues (Figure S1).

225

Innate responses of the infected nasal turbinate tissues

226

To start evaluating the global host response pertaining to each of the conditions, the

227

samples were grouped in principal-component analysis (PCA). As shown, SARS-

228

CoV-2 and influenza exerted distinct global signatures in the nasal turbinate tissues,

229

reflected by their disparate coordinates (Figure 3A); SARS-CoV-2 and influenza

230

transcriptional signatures differentially distributed from mock along PC2, with more

231

progressive transcriptional response observed along this axis in SARS-CoV-2

232

infected tissues. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially affected the

233

global gene expression profile in the nasal turbinate tissues, leading to differential

11

234

expression of 371 genes (309 upregulated and 62 downregulated following infection;

235

Figure 3B). The most profoundly upregulated genes included antiviral ISGs,

236

cytokines and chemokines (Figures 3C, S2A). Of note, in addition to familiar ISGs,

237

one of the most upregulated genes in SARS-CoV-2 infected nasal turbinate tissues

238

was the long non-protein coding RNA LINC00487 (Figure 3C), recently identified as

239

a novel ISG (37). Employing qRT-PCR of RNA purified from independent infected

240

and mock-control nasal turbinate tissues, we validated the viral-induced upregulation

241

of selected innate immunity genes following infection (Figure S3). In accordance,

242

and further defining the affected biological pathways and predicted functions,

243

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection in the nasal

244

mucosal tissues primarily induced antiviral and proinflammatory pathways related to

245

interferon signaling, innate immunity, and immune cell activation (Figure 3C,D, see

246

also Figure 5A). Despite similar levels of infection, we observed some transcriptional

247

response variability between the three independent nasal turbinate tissues (mainly

248

with respect to the extent, but not the direction: up- versus downregulation, of

249

differential gene response; Figure 3D). As we have shown before, this tissue-to-

250

tissues variability, reflecting the natural diversity between individuals, is expected in

251

studies involving human tissues (36).

252

Influenza virus infection of the same nasal turbinate tissues differentially affected the

253

expression of a lower number of genes compared to SARS-CoV-2 (186; 182

254

upregulated and 4 downregulated; Figure 3B). Comparison between the nasal

255

turbinate tissue response to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, identified 173 common and

256

198 SARS-CoV-2-distinct differentially expressed (DE) genes (Figure 3B). Innate

257

immunity genes related to interferon signaling, immune activation, and antiviral

258

pathways were commonly induced (albeit to a variable extent) by the 2 viruses in the

12

259

nasal mucosal tissues (see also Figure 5A). The common and distinct response

260

patterns of the nasal mucosal tissues to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus could be

261

clearly delineated by a clustered heatmap analysis of all significantly DE genes,

262

which identified 4 clusters of genes, defined by the direction (upregulation vs.

263

downregulation) and/or the extent of their differential expression (Figure 3D). In

264

general, the nasal turbinate tissue response to SARS-CoV-2 appeared broader than

265

the response to influenza virus, and included innate immune and immune cell

266

maturation and activation pathways which were distinctively or more significantly

267

enriched following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figures 3D, 5A). We also noted the more

268

significant effect of SARS-CoV-2 on pathways of translation regulation (Figures 3D)

269

– a finding which could be related to the multi-faceted strategies employed by

270

coronaviruses in general and by SARS-CoV-2 to suppress host protein synthesis

271

(38).

272

Innate immune responses of the infected lung tissues

273

Strikingly, a different response pattern was observed upon infection of the lung

274

tissues, where SARS-CoV-2 (despite higher infection level - as demonstrated by

275

qRT-PCR and percent viral reads; Figures 2A, S1) elicited a restricted tissue

276

response. This was reflected in the PCA analysis, showing that influenza virus-

277

infected tissues could be grouped by their greater transcriptional perturbation

278

(compared to both mock- and SARS-CoV-2 infected samples) along PC1, whereas

279

SARS-CoV-2 elicited modest transcriptional changes in this space (Figure 4A). The

280

relatively restricted lung tissue response to SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated by the

281

lower number of differentially-expressed genes (124 genes; 117 upregulated and 7

282

downregulated; Figure 4B), along with the lower extent of gene upregulation (Figure

283

4C,D), compared to the effect of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal tissues (Figure 3) and to the

13

284

parallel effect of influenza virus in the same lung tissues (which resulted in a

285

response of much greater magnitude, affecting 1072 genes, the majority of which

286

were not affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection; Figure 3B). In fact, in agreement with

287

the PCA (Figure 4A), a clustered heatmap analysis of all significantly DE genes,

288

showed that the relative transcriptional profile of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung tissues

289

was closer to that of mock-infected tissues, and completely distinct from that of the

290

highly responsive influenza-infected lung tissues (Figure 4D). While both viruses

291

induced the expression of genes related to interferon signaling pathway (Figures 4E,

292

5B), influenza virus infection of the lungs induced a wide range of innate immune,

293

immune cell activation differentiation and trafficking signaling pathways (Figures

294

4F,G, 5B), cytokines and chemokines (Figures S2, S3), not affected by SARS-CoV-

295

2.

296

Employing independent qRT-PCR, we showed a low-to-absent upregulation of IFN-

297

I, IFN-II, and IFN-III by SARS-CoV-2, compared to influenza virus, with the

298

differences reaching statistical significance for IFNα, IFNβ and IFNλ (Figure 5C).

299

Significantly, no upregulation of IFNλ1 was observed in all SARS-CoV-2 infected

300

lung tissues examined, a finding that contrasted with the upregulation of IFNλ1 in

301

both SARS-CoV-2-infected turbinate tissues and influenza-infected lung tissues

302

(Figure 5C).

303

Together, the combined data revealed that SARS-CoV-2 affected the nasal mucosal

DISCUSSION

312

We have characterized the initial steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection and innate immune

313

response within the natural complexity of human nasal turbinate tissues, maintained

314

in organ culture. Comparing the global transcriptional signatures of nasal and lung

315

tissues, infected in parallel with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus, we have revealed

316

for the first time distinct virus-host interactions in the upper and lower respiratory

317

tract, which could determine the outcome and pathogenesis of COVID-19.

318

SARS-CoV-2 productively infected the nasal turbinate tissues (Figures 1,2);

319

Consistent with the expression pattern of the viral receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2,

320

we showed the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 to respiratory epithelial cells lining the nasal

321

mucosa (Figure 1). Active viral replication was demonstrated by the rapid increase

322

in viral sub-genomic mRNA within the infected tissues, along with de-novo secretion

323

of infectious viral progeny (Figure 2). Hence, the nasal mucosa, supporting efficient

324

viral replication, could constitute a key site of transmission, from which the progeny

325

virus may further spread to the lungs (across the respiratory mucosa, or more likely

326

via aspiration from the infected nasal secretions), and to the central nervous system

327

[via the olfactory neural–mucosal interface; (39)].

328

Importantly, employing gene-wide transcriptome analysis, we have shown that the

329

nasal mucosal tissue mounted a robust antiviral and inflammatory innate immune

330

response to SARS-CoV-2, with upregulation of numerous antiviral ISGs, cytokines,

331

and chemokines, related to interferon signaling and immune cell activation pathways

332

(Figures 3,5,S2,S3). Moreover, comparative analysis of the nasal tissue innate

333

response to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus, while demonstrating commonly

334

induced antiviral pathways, identified virus-specific transcriptional footprints, with

16

335

SARS-CoV-2 inducing an overall broader nasal-mucosal innate responses than

336

influenza virus (Figures 3,5,S2).

337

In sharp contrast, infected lung tissues exhibited a restricted response to SARS-

338

CoV-2 infection, despite comparable-to-higher viral infection levels. This finding was

339

further underscored by the strong innate immune response of the same tissues to

340

influenza virus infection. While the interferon signaling pathway was commonly

341

induced by the two viruses, a wide range of antiviral and immune-cell activation

342

pathways, cytokines and chemokines, which were induced following influenza virus

343

infection were not stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs (Figures 4, 5, S2,

344

S3). The restricted lung-tissue response observed herein is in agreement with and

345

expands recent reports of silenced IFN response to SARS-CoV-2 in transformed and

346

primary human airway epithelial cell cultures and in lung explants, whereas some

347

reports demonstrated specific chemokines induction in primary cells or even IFN

348

elevations in lung organoids (9–12, 25, 26). These differences reflect the complex

349

interplay between the virus and the different cell types under varying experimental

350

conditions in culture and within integral multi-cell-type tissues.

351

Our findings imply that SARS-CoV-2 successfully manipulates the innate immune

352

response in the lung tissues, which were otherwise capable of mounting a robust IFN

353

antiviral response to influenza. In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to

354

encode synergistic innate immune antagonist genes [i.e., Nsp1-shutting down

355

cellular translation, Nsp3, Nsp5, Nsp10, Nsp13, Nsp14, ORF3, ORF6 and ORF7,

356

ORF8; (12, 38, 40, 41)], and thus may more effectively dampen the lung antiviral

357

defence compared with influenza virus, whose IFN evasion function is mediated

358

mainly by NS1 (12, 42). The question remains: why the same SARS-CoV-2 immune

359

manipulation strategies are rendered ineffective in the nasal mucosa tissue milieu?

360

We suggest that the nasal mucosa, being constantly exposed to environmental

361

agents and resident microflora (unlike the relatively sterile lower respiratory tract), is

362

conditioned to persistent innate immune signalling, which could override the viral

363

antagonists. In support of this hypothesis is the recently demonstrated skewed

364

expression of innate immune genes in cultured nasal epithelial cells (13).

365

A schematic illustration of the differential tissue-specific innate immune responses to

366

SARS-CoV-2 in nasal and lung tissues, as compared to influenza virus mediated

367

responses, is shown in Figure 6. Our findings highlight the potential importance of

368

the nasal mucosa as a first-barrier to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, once the

369

virus gains access to the lungs, the compromised early innate immune response

370

could impede viral clearance. Beyond the global transcriptomics pattern, the

371

conspicuous lack of type I and III IFNs upregulation (with an absolute lack of INFλ1)

372

in early SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues (as opposed to their significant

373

stimulation in influenza-infected lung tissues; Figures 5C) deserves further

374

consideration, in relation to the distinctive late-phase pathogenesis of COVID-19;

375

IFNs type I and III share common antiviral functions, yet, type III IFNs, beyond their

376

role in antiviral defense, have been shown to exert critical immune-regulatory

377

activities - limiting excessive local inflammation (15). Thus, it is tempting to speculate

378

that the restricted antiviral and immune-regulatory IFN response in early SARS-CoV-

379

2-infected lung tissues (not observed following influenza virus infection), could

380

mechanistically explain the subsequent uncontrolled SARS-CoV-2 replication and

381

imbalanced hyper-inflammatory response, characteristic of late-phase COVID-19.

382

Our study has several limitations. The cellular heterogeneity within the tissues limits

383

the resolution of isolated molecular pathways. Additionally, native respiratory tissues

384

in organ culture are relatively short-lived (~a week) compared to primary human

18

385

airway epithelial cells and to the self-renewable stem cell-derived organoid cultures,

386

which have proven useful for the studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection and cellular

387

response (9–11, 43, 44). Nonetheless, our studies recapitulate viral infection and

388

host response within the authentic multicellular and morphologically-intact tissue

389

microenvironment - containing tissue epithelial, vascular endothelial, stromal and

390

immune cells, and the specific extracellular matrix. It is notable that the comparative

391

data between the human nasal and lung tissues were not obtained from the same

392

individuals. Yet, we believe that the findings, based on extensive analyses of

393

independent tissues from different individuals, faithfully support the generalizability of

394

the observed tissue-specific patterns. Notwithstanding, the comparison of SARS-

395

CoV-2 and Influenza infections was done in parallel within the same donor tissue.

396

Furthermore, these studies capture the inherent person-to-person variability of innate

397

immune responses, thereby paving the way to future studies of personal host

398

features which determine the innate responses to viral infection along the respiratory

399

tract.

400
401

In summary, we have demonstrated the active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in native

402

human nasal-mucosal tissues, providing new insights into differential tissue-specific

403

innate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in nasal and lung tissues. Our findings

404

shed light on the nasal mucosa as a key site of viral transmission and innate immune

405

defense, implying a window of opportunity for early interventions, whereas the

406

restricted innate immune response in early-SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues,

407

contrasting with their robust response to influenza virus, could underlie the unique

408

extensive late-phase lung damage of advanced COVID-19. Studies in the nasal

409

mucosal model can be further employed to assess the impact of viral evolutionary

MATERIALS AND METHODS

414

Cells and viruses.

415

Simian kidney Vero E6 (ATCC CRL-1586) and Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK,

416

ATCC® CCL-34™) cells were maintained in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium

417

(EMEM; Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel), supplemented with 10% fetal

418

bovine serum, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 10 IU/ml Penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin

419

(Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel). SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020

420

(NR-52281; obtained from BEI resources) was propagated in Vero E6 cells. SARS-

421

CoV-2 clinical isolate (SARS-CoV-2 isolate Israel-Jerusalem-854/2020) was isolated

422

on Vero E6 cells from a positive nasopharyngeal swab sample, obtained at the

423

Hadassah Hospital Clinical Virology Laboratory. The virus was isolated and

424

propagated (3 passages) in Vero E6 cells, and sequence verified. Influenza virus

425

A(H1N1) pdm09 (NIBRG-121xp, Cat# 09/268; obtained from NIBSC, UK) was

426

propagated in MDCK cells. The virus titers of cleared infected cells- and tissue

427

supernatants were determined by a standard TCID50 assay on Vero E6 cells (SARS-

428

CoV-2) or MDCK cells (influenza virus).

Preparation and infection of nasal turbinate and lung organ cultures.

431

Nasal turbinate and lung organ cultures were prepared and infected as previously

432

described (27, 36). In brief, inferior nasal turbinate tissues were obtained from

433

consented patients undergoing turbinectomy procedures, and lung tissues (the tumor

434

free margins) were obtained from consented patients undergoing lobectomy

435

operations. The studies were approved by the Hadassah Medical Center and the

436

Sheba Medical Center Institutional Review Boards. Fresh tissues were kept on ice

437

until further processed at the same day. The tissues were sectioned by a microtome

443

at 37°C, 5% CO2. The tissues were processed and infected at the same day (the

444

day of harvesting; Day 0). For infection of the organ cultures, the tissues were placed

445

in 48-well plates and inoculated with the respective virus (2x105 TCID50/well in 0.3

446

ml) for 12h to allow effective viral adsorption. Following viral adsorption, the cultures

447

were washed three times (in 0.3 ml of complete medium) and further incubated for

448

the duration of the experiment, with replacement of the culture medium every 2 to 3

449

days. Tissue viability was monitored by the mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzyme

450

492

Nasal organ cultures (from 3 independent donors) and lung organ cultures (from 5

493

independent donors) were each infected in parallel with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza

494

virus (with mock-infected controls used for each individual tissue).

495

Preparation of transcriptome libraries and deep sequencing were performed as

496

previously described in detail (35). Normalization and differential expression were

497

done with the DESeq2 package (version 1.22.2). Samples of each tissue were

498

analyzed separately, after removing genes with less than 10 counts. Differential

499

expression was calculated with default parameters, incorporating both the donor and

500

the infection information in the statistical model. Pairwise comparisons of the

501

infected- versus mock-infected samples were performed, while considering the donor

502

effect (design = ~ Donor + Infection). Genes with a significant effect (padj<0.1) were

503

further filtered based on their baseMean and log2FoldChange values, requiring

504

baseMean > 5 and |log2FoldChange| > 5/baseMean^0.5 + 0.3. In order test the

505

contribution of infection to the variance in the system as a whole, the LRT test was

506

used, comparing the full model, Donor + Infection, to a reduced model of just the

507

Donor factor. Genes with a padj<0.05 in this test were taken as significant and

508

clustered using R’s kmeans function. Results are shown for k=2 in lungs tissue and

509

for k=4 in turbinates tissue.

Figure 6. Schematic illustration of the early patterns of viral infection and

local-mucosal innate immune responses in human nasal turbinate and lung

tissues. In the work presented here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 productively infects

897

respiratory epithelial cells within the nasal turbinate tissues. Comparing the innate

898

response patterns of nasal and lung tissues, infected in parallel with SARS-CoV-2

899

and influenza virus, we have revealed differential tissue-specific and virus-specific

900

innate immune responses in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Our findings

901

emphasize the role of the nasal mucosa in viral transmission and innate antiviral

902

defence, whereas the restricted innate immune response in early-SARS-CoV-2-

infected lung tissues (contrasting with their robust response to influenza virus) could
