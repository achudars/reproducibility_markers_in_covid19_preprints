Abstract:

13

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel ssRNA+ virus from the Coronaviridae family, which has caused the

14

COVID-19 pandemic. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the largest of RNA viruses,

15

comprising of 26 known protein-coding loci. This study aimed to explore the coding potential

16

of negative-strand RNA intermediate for its potential to contain additional protein coding-loci.

17

Surprisingly, we have found several putative ORFs and one brandt new functional SARS-CoV-

18

2 protein-coding loci and called it Avo1 (Ambient viral ORF1). This sequence is located on

19

negative-sense RNA intermediate and bona fide coding for 81 amino acid residues long protein

20

and contains a strong Kozak sequence for translation on eukaryotic ribosomes.

21

In silico translated protein Avo1 has a predominantly alpha-helical structure. The existence of

22

the Avo1 gene is supported also by its evolutionarily and structural conservation in RaTG13 bat

23

coronavirus. The nucleotide sequence of Avo1 also contains a unique SREBP2 binding site

24

which is closely related to the so-called “cytokine storm” in severe COVID-19 patients.

25

Altogether, our results suggest the existence of still undescribed SARS-CoV-2 protein, which

26

may play an important role in the viral lifecycle and COVID-19 pathogenesis.

Introduction:

33

Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, as a causative agent of COVID-19 disease, is intensively

34

studied worldwide. It is generally considered that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is coding for 16

35

non-structural proteins (NSP1-16), 4 structural proteins (surface glycoprotein, membrane

36

glycoprotein, envelope protein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein), and 6 – 9 “accessory factors”

37

(still designated as “open reading frames”, ORFs) (Gordon et al. 2020). The length of the

38

SARS-CoV-2 proteins varied from 1945 aa to 13 aa (Huang et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020, 6; Helmy

39

et al. 2020). The shortest SARS-CoV-2 protein has only 13 aa (nsp11) and its function is

40

unknown (Chen, Liu, a Guo 2020), followed by ORF10 (38 aa), ORF7b (43 aa), ORF6 (61 aa),

41

and envelope protein (75 aa) (Wu et al. 2020). The longest SARS-CoV-2 protein is a multi-

42

domain protein nsp3 (1945 aa) (Helmy et al. 2020). All to date described SARS-CoV-2 proteins

43

are coded by positive-sense viral RNA strand. Overall, positive-sense RNA viruses are

44

generally accepted to encode proteins solely on the positive strand, but in the current work by

45

Dinan et al., they demonstrated that also negative-sense viral RNA strand has the potential to

46

be protein-coding (Dinan et al. 2020). We have decided to inspect the negative-sense

47

intermediate viral RNA strand of SARS-CoV-2 and look for new potential ORFs. As an

48

indicator for in vivo validity, we have chosen a combination of complementary bioinformatics

49

approaches, e.g. the presence of the so-called Kozak sequence, which is considered strong

50

supportive evidence for being translated on host ribosomes (Gong et al. 2014), transcription

51

factor binding site analysis, homology search, and 3D structure prediction. Our analyses

52

propose a novel SARS-CoV-2 ORF, which has a high probability to be translated in host cells.

Methods:

63

The SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512.2) was searched by NCBI ORFfinder

64

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/), to predict all potential ORFs longer than 200

65

nucleotides (we have chosen an arbitrary threshold of 200 nt to make this analysis feasible and

66

to minimize false-positive results). We have focused especially on the negative strand

67

intermediate (i.e. frames -1, -2, and -3). Using ATGpr web-based tool (https://atgpr.dbcls.jp/)

68

(Salamov, Nishikawa, a Swindells 1998), we have inspected, if they contain the so-called

69

Kozak sequence, which is considered an important signal in the 5´ end of mRNAs to be

70

translated on eukaryotic ribosomes (Noderer et al. 2014). To compute Mw and isoelectric point

71

(pI), we used the Expasy Compute pI/Mw tool (https://web.expasy.org/compute_pi/) (Gasteiger

72

et al. 2005). For the transcription factor binding site analysis, the RegRNA 2.0. webserver was

73

used (Chang et al. 2013). To find possible domain homologs we used NCBI´s Conserved

74

Domains Database (CDD) webserver (Marchler-Bauer et al. 2015) with an E-value cut-off set

75

to 10. For ab initio structural modeling, the QUARK tool was used (Xu a Zhang 2012) and the

76

resulting structures were visualized within UCSC Chimera 1.15 workflow (Pettersen et al.

77

2004).

Results and discussion:

87

We have predicted all putative SARS-CoV-2 ORFs longer than 200 nucleotides,

88

resulting in a set of 8 protein candidates (all ORFs are enclosed in SM1, the longest was 303 nt

89

long, and the shortest 201 nt in size). Then we have inspected if they contain the

90

so-called Kozak sequence. We have found one highly promising candidate locus and called it

91

Avo1 (Ambient viral ORF1). Avo1 nucleotide sequence (Figure 1 Top) contains a very well-

92

conserved Kozak signal in the form of RYMRMVAUGGC (Noderer et al. 2014), which is a

93

nucleic acid motif that functions as the protein translation initiation site in most mammalian

mRNA transcripts (Noderer et al. 2014). The strongest Kozak signals found in the SARS-CoV-

95

2 genome are depicted in Figure 1 Bottom (five of six Kozak signals are located in RNA+

96

strand, one is located on the RNA- strand).

97

Avo1 locus is situated on nucleotide positions 422 – 667 of the reference SARS-CoV-2

98

genome (NC_045512.2) and putative protein is translated in reading frame -2 (i.e. only from

99

negative-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA intermediate). Protein product would be 81 amino acid

100

residues long and its molecular weight was computed to be 9586.06 Da with an isoelectric point

101

(pI) 9.22. Interestingly, the proposed Avo1 gene contains 12 nt long SREBP2 binding site

102

(Figure 1 Top). Recently it was found that “COVID-19-activated SREBP2 disturbs cholesterol

103

biosynthesis and leads to cytokine storm” (Lee et al. 2020).

122

Homology searches revealed that Avo1 ORFs are evolutionarily conserved in several

123

coronaviruses, e.g. in bat coronaviruses RaTG13, RpShaanxi2011, BtRs-BetaCoV/HuB2013,

124

Rc-o319, or in pangolin coronavirus GX/P2V (Figure 2 Top). On the other side, human SARS-

125

CoV and MERS-CoV Avo1 loci are truncated by stop codons - dynamic loss or gain of specific

126

accessory proteins may be an explanation for different viral properties (virulence, pathogenesis,

127

etc.). Three weak domain homology signals were found in the CDD database: B-12 dependent

128

methionine synthase, Herpes envelope superfamily, and adenosine deaminase.

129

Another evidence for possible Avo1 protein biological significance is that instead of

130

some disordered clumps, an independent ab initio prediction of tertiary structures of SARS-

131

CoV-2 Avo1 and RatG13 Avo1 has shown five alpha-helices forming conserved structures

132

(Figure 2 Bottom).

139

Our subsequent searches reveal a couple of interesting ORFs located on negative sense

140

RNA in other Coronaviruses, so it seems that the negative-sense coronaviral RNA can serve as

141

an additional pool for their coding potential. For example, Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8

142

(NC_010438.1) has a 438 aa long ORF and Alphacoronavirus Bat-CoV/P.kuhlii/Italy/3398-

143

19/2015 (NC_009988.1) has a 313 aa long ORF on its negative sense RNA. All the longest 13

144

hits (over 200 aa) are listed in SM5. Analyzes of their predicted pI revealed, that all of them

145

have pI higher than 8.4 (with the average value of 10.07) - it is very surprising because there

146

was no significant sequence homology between them. Nine of these long ORFs also contains

147

potential nuclear localization signal(s) (see SM5). Following prediction of N-glycosylation

148

suggests that the vast majority (12/13) of these ORFs are posttranslationally modified by N-

149

glycosylation. N-glycosylation is a common phenomenon, how viral proteins can be recognized

150

by an innate immune response, which is the first line of defense against infection (York,

151

Stevens, a Alymova 2019). Our findings are summarized and depicted in the figure below

152

(Figure 3).

Figure 3. Proposed hypothesis about accessory viral proteins coding on negative sense RNA

159

strand. The replication of coronaviral RNA takes place inside special compartments connected to the

160

endoplasmic reticulum. We propose the hypothesis, that also negative sense RNA has a coding potential

161

and most of the resulting proteins are likely to be glycosylated. In addition, some of them are possibly

162

translocated into the nucleus, where can modulate host gene expression via nucleic acid binding.

163
164

It was found that the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome is very diverse and rich (Kim et al.

165

2020) and therefore, it is likely that also SARS-CoV-2 proteome will follow this trend and still

166

unheeded viral proteins or protein variants wait for its discovery. Every newly described SARS-

167

CoV-2 protein (and its host interacting proteins) could be a potential target for a drug

168

repurposing or development of novel therapies (Gordon et al. 2020), for instance it was found,

169

that SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins ORF6 and ORF8 inhibit type I interferon signaling

170

pathway, and thus play a critical role in innate immune suppression during viral infection (Li

171

et al. 2020, 6). Altogether, our results suggest the existence of a still undescribed SARS-CoV-

172

2 protein, which may play an important role in the viral lifecycle and COVID-19 pathogenesis.
