Abstract
Pandemic COVID-19 outbreak has been caused due to SARS-COV2 pathogen, resulting
millions of infection and death worldwide, USA being on top at the present moment. The
long, complex orf1ab polyproteins of SARS-COV2 play an important role in viral RNA
synthesis. To assess the impact of mutations in this important domain, we analyzed 1134
complete protein sequences of orf1ab polyprotein from NCBI Virus database from affected
patients across various states of USA from December 2019 to 25th April, 2020. Multiple
sequence alignment using Clustal Omega followed by statistical significance was calculated.
Four significant mutations T265I (nsp 2), P4715L (nsp 12) and P5828L and Y5865C (both at
nsp 13) were identified in important non-structural proteins, which function either as
replicase or helicase. A comparative analysis shows 265T>I, 5828P>L and 5865Y>C are
unique to USA and not reported from Europe or Asia; while one, 4715P>L is predominant in
both Europe and USA. Mutational changes in amino acids are predicted to alter structure and
function of corresponding proteins, thereby it is imperative to consider the mutational spectra
while designing new antiviral therapeutics targeting viral orf1ab.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 is the responsible pathogen for pandemic COVID 19. Positive-stranded, RNA
genomes of Coronaviruses is around 27 to 32-kb in length, of which about 2/3rd encompasses
viral Orf1ab gene and expresses the largest and most complex polyproteins of any RNA
viruses. The open reading frame 1 (ORF1), functions as replicase, replicase/transcriptase, or
polymerase polyproteins, is translated into ORF1a (approximately 486kDa, major product)
and ORF1b (~306KDa) polyproteins in the host cell. Virus-encoded proteinases including
Papain like protease (PLPs) and 3C like protease (3CL Pro) cleaves ORF1 into 16
nonstructural proteins (nsps)(1,2). ORF1a comprising nsps (nsp 1 to nsp 10) play an
important role in coping cellular stresses and maintaining functional integrity of the cellular
components along with the pivotal roles in viral replication. On the other hand, ORF1b
encodes viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), helicase (nsp13), exonuclease
(nsp14), a polyU (Uridylate) specific endonuclease (nsp15), and methyl transferase (nsp16).
Hence, majority of these nsps play an important role in viral pathogenesis and promising
target for anti- viral drug targeting and vaccine synthesis (3).
At present, USA is one of the worst affected countries globally in terms of affected
individuals and the number of death, is concerned. Till 25th April, USA is reported to have
860,772 positive cases and 44,053 deaths (4). This adverse condition led to investigate the
sequence of viral whole genome reported to NCBI virus database. As on 25th April 2020 (till
12 noon, IST), around 1134 Orf1ab polyprotein sequence have been submitted from USA
alone. Different states of USA like Washington D.C, New York, Connecticut, Idaho, Georgia
etc have uploaded sequence of Orf1ab polyprotein in the database. Since COVID-19
originated in Wuhan and found to be extended to different parts of the globe with variation in
its virulence, it is imperative to identify the mutations occurred in Orf1ab polyprotein and
consequent impact in protein structure and interaction with the host body. Hence the present
study aims (i) to identify the mutations observed in orf1ab polyprotein, (ii) to predict the
conformational changes of SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein due to the mutations and (iii) to identify
the signature pattern, if any for USA.

Methodology
ORF1ab protein sequence retrieval from the database
The protein sequences were retrieved from “NCBI Virus” database, specific input was
“SARS-CoV-2”. Then the output was refined with sequence length 7050 to 7100, as the
length of our target orf1ab polyprotein is 7096. Total 1307 sequences were retrieved, among
them 125 sequences were from Asia, 42 from Europe and 1134 solely from USA.
Screening of submitted sequences and selection of study sample
Incomplete sequences or sequence with undetermined residues (mentioned as X) were
eliminated. A total of 867 orf1ab polyprotein complete sequences deposited from 31 different
states of USA were considered for the present study (Group A). All the above-mentioned
sequences from Asia (Group B) and Europe (Group C) were also selected.
Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) and analysis of mutational spectra
Clustal Omega (5) was employed to align multiple sequences of each of the above-mentioned
groups. Then sequences of Group A were subdivided into 31 subgroups depending on the
regional source from which the sequence was originated and MSA was conducted
encompassing all subgroups using ancestral orf1ab polyprotein sequence of Wuhan
(YP_009742608, comprising 7096 residues) as reference sequence (6,7). Gap opening
penalty and gap extension penalty was set 12 and 2 respectively to ensure that unnecessary
gaps are not created during alignment and alterations are visualised easily. Alignment results
were thoroughly screened to find out the exact location of the mutations and alteration linked
to that position.
Calculation of statistical significance to detect signature mutations of USA
The number of occurrence of each mutated variant in Group A, B and C were calculated
(suppose a, b and c) and then divided by the total number of sequence submitted under that
group (suppose x for Group A, y for Group B and z for Group C). The proportion of each
variant in Group A would be a/x and likewise for other Groups. Then p-value was calculated
through Z-score using the proportion of the mutant and sample size to establish whether the
occurrence of that mutant variant in USA is significantly higher in comparison to Asia and
Europe. Two-tailed p values were calculated using 0.05 as the significance level (8). Thus
attempt has been made to identify the signature mutations in the region of orf1ab polyprotein.
Homology Modelling and simulation of protein structure
Structures of the associated non structural proteins for wild type were reported at I-Tasser
server, however, the structures were not available for the varied amino acid alteration. To
identify the alteration, Homology Modelling method by I-Tasser was used to generate
secondary structure, which was then superimposed with the wild type using UCSF Chimera
and PyMOL for easy visualization and comparison.

Results and Discussion
To assess the structural variation and identify the signature mutations, if any among the viral
strain(s) identified from USA, all 1134 sequences, submitted to NCBI Virus database
(December 2019 to 25th April 2020) were retrieved. Following the exclusion criteria
mentioned above, 867 complete sequences from 31 different states of USA were obtained.
For each subgroup of Group A, mutations observed in >5% studied population were taken
into considerations and shown in Table 1.
Mutation at amino acid (AA) location 265 (Thr > Ile) of nsp2 is observed among ~50% states
(subgroups) and 44.2% sequences in USA (Table 1). Nsp2 is an important domain that takes
care of the functional integrity of mitochondria and copes up cellular stress (9). In addition to
this, nsp2 co-operates with nsp4 in viral replication. Nsp12 is important for its RNA
dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity and Pro > Leu in 4715 at this domain is a
significant alteration, reported in 28 out of 31 states. Nsp 13 functions as helicase protein,
which is a key enzyme in viral replication and therefore, two mutations, P5828L and Y5865C
observed in this domain, expected to alter in structure-function and interaction with host’s
target site. These two mutations, in particular are observed and presumed to be linked and
found in equal proportions (0.321), among affected individuals from 9 out of 31 states.
All these four mutations are widely observed throughout the country but some mutations are
consistently observed to specific regions (Figure 1). Georgia and South Carolina are two
neighbouring states sharing common border in the South East region of USA and both carry
mutant variant Leucine at the position of 971 (P>L) at nsp 3 and 6158 (F>L) at nsp14 in
more than 60% cases. We found another mutation 3606L>F in nsp6 and individuals from
Florida, Texas, Ohio, Nevada and Georgia had this mutation with a frequency of >10%. Nsp
6 plays a role in initial induction of autophagosomes from host endoplasmic reticulum, but
gradually limits the expansion of these phagosomes which are unable to deliver viral
components to lysosomes. It is important to note here that 3606L>F mutations were found in
Italy while analyzing Group C (present study), which further strengthens our previous
reporting (10).
To study the implication of these mutations, we have compared the prevalence of T265I in
European and Asian population with that of USA population. Strikingly, Threonine at 265 is
the wild type AA found in all sequences from Europe and 119 out of 125 sequences from
Asia. Therefore, the mutated AA Isoleucine is present in only 4.8% patient population in
Asia, null in European population so far, but observed in 44.2% patient population (383 out
of 867) in USA establishing it to be a signature mutation of the country (p = <0.0001).
Let us consider the mutation 4715 P > L, which is quite common in Europe and present in
countries like Spain, France, Greece etc. and the amino acid variant Leucine is found in
51.6% (16 out of 31 sequences deposited by European countries). In USA, the frequency of
Leucine is 58.1%, not significantly higher in comparison to Europe (p = 0.47) but clearly
compared to Asia (<0.0001). However, the mutant Leucine at 4715 is consistently observed
in America. Two other most frequent mutations in USA are 5828 P > L and 5865 Y > C,
found in equal proportion (both observed 278 out of 867), presumed to be linked, and
exclusively found in USA, so far (Table 2).

The four signature mutations are located in nsp 2, nsp 12 and nsp 13 respectively (Figure 2).
Non-structural protein 2 is assumed to be responsible in the modulation of host cell survival
signaling pathway by interacting with PHB and PHB2 in the host body (9, 11, 12). Change of
a polar amino acid (Threonine) to a non-polar one (Isoleucine) makes it hydrophobic and
induces structural alteration in that domain which is observed by simulating structure of the
nsp2 protein harboring mutated allele through homology modeling using I-Tasser (13, 14,
15).
Structure prediction for wild type nsps are already available in I-Tasser; which gave us the
opportunity to evaluate and superimpose three altered nsp structures (nsp 2, nsp 12 and nsp
13; against said signature mutations), using UCSF Chimera (16) and PyMOL (17) for clear
visualisation of the alteration (Figure 3A). RdRp (nsp12) is responsible for viral replication
and transcription. Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV shares only 79% genome
similarity (18, 19), with regard to nsp12 sequence similarity, is comparatively much higher
(98%) inferring the evolutionary significance of these conserved region (8, 20). RdRp is a
major antiviral drug target (21, 22) and thus the structural alteration due to the mutant AA
shall have important implications. Comparing the superimposed structure of RdRp, we have
observed four small domains with the altered structure in the mutant sequence (Figure 3B)
and these needs to be investigated further. Helicase (nsp 13) is a multi-functional protein
having a zinc-binding domain in N-terminus exhibiting RNA and DNA duplex-unwinding
activities with 5' to 3' polarity (11, 12). Figure 3C exhibits some important structural
alteration due to those two mutations present in close proximity near the N-terminus;
including a major structural alteration, where a loop or chain-like structure is transformed
into a helix, found near the N-terminus of nsp 13. The length of nsp 13 or Helicase protein is
601 (5325-5925 of orf1ab polyprotein) and the above-mentioned alteration is found in the
location 592-598, indicating possible variation in functional outcome.
Conclusions
Orf1ab polyprotein of SARS-CoV-2 encompasses mutational spectra. Comparing to the
European and Asian strain(s) we observed four characteristic mutations 265T>I (nsp 2),
4715P>L (nsp 12), 5828P>L (nsp 13) and 5865Y>C (nsp 13) which can be considered as a
signature pattern for USA. It is noteworthy to mention here that 5828P>L and 5865Y>C,
exclusively found in USA till now; whereas 265T>I is found in very low abundance in Asia
(4.42%) and not found at all in Europe. 4715P>L is commonly found in both USA (58.1%)
and Europe (51.6%) but present in low abundance in Asia(11.2%). 971P>L and 6158F>L are
frequently observed in Georgia and South Carolina only representing the South-East region
of the country. All of the four signature mutations caused structural alteration in their
respective non-structural proteins (nsp 2, nsp 12 and nsp 13). Thereby it is essential to
consider the mutational spectra while designing new antiviral therapeutics targeting viral
orf1ab.
