SUMMARY

23
24

COVID-19 manifests with a wide diversity of clinical phenotypes characterized by

25

dysfunctional and exaggerated host immune responses. Many results have been

26

described on the status of the immune system of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2,

27

but there are still aspects that have not been fully characterized. In this study, we have

28

analyzed a cohort of patients with mild, moderate and severe disease. We performed

29

flow cytometric studies and correlated the data with the clinical features and clinical

30

laboratory values of patients. Both conventional and unsupervised data analyses

31

concluded that patients with severe disease are characterized, among others, by a higher

32

state of activation in all T cell subsets, higher expression of perforin and granzyme B in

33

cytotoxic cells, expansion of adaptive NK cells and the accumulation of activated and

34

immature dysfunctional monocytes which are identified by a low expression of HLA-

35

DR and an intriguing abrupt change in the expression pattern of CD300 receptors. More

36

importantly, correlation analysis showed a strong association between the alterations in

37

the immune cells and the clinical signs of severity. These results indicate that patients

38

with severe COVID-19 have a broad perturbation of their immune system, and they will

39

help to understand the immunopathogenesis of severe COVID-19 as well as could be of

40

special value for physicians to decide which specific therapeutic options are most

41

effective for their patients.

INTRODUCTION

48
49

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause coronavirus

50

disease 2019 (COVID-19) which, in the worst cases scenario, can lead to severe

51

manifestations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, characterized by aggressive

52

inflammatory responses in the lower part of respiratory tract, and multiple organ failure.

53

A relevant number of symptomatic patients require hospitalization and a portion of

54

them are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), moreover death may occur in a

55

significant number of cases (Huang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a). The thrombotic

56

complications associated with COVID-19 represent a very important problem.

57

Embolism and thrombosis are frequent clinical features of patients with severe COVID-

58

19 (Klok et al., 2020; Lodigiani et al., 2020), sometimes despite anticoagulation

59

therapy. Patients with severe disease have abnormal coagulation characteristics,

60

including elevated D-dimer levels, and generalized thrombotic microvascular injury

61

(Rapkiewicz et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a).

62

In acute respiratory viral infections, pathology can be caused directly by the virus and/or

63

by a damaging immune response from the host (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Moore and

64

June, 2020; Vabret et al., 2020). In this sense, severe COVID-19 is due not only to the

65

direct effects of SARS-CoV-2, but also to a misdirected host response with complex

66

immune dysregulation (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020; Kuri-Cervantes et al.,

67

2020; Laing et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020; Su et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b).

68

Therefore, it is very important to exactly recognize and identify the immunological

69

signatures that correlate with the severity of the disease, since this aspect undoubtedly

70

has relevant clinical implications related to patients´ stratification and management.

71

From the first publications, the knowledge about the dysfunctional immune response in

72

COVID-19 is constantly evolving. Most reports on immune dysfunction in COVID-19

73

patients have focused on severe disease. Hence, patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit

74

in plasma higher amounts of numerous cytokines and chemokines than less severe cases

75

(Herold et al., 2020; Del Valle et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Severe manifestations are

76

caused, in part, by high levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and the subsequent cytokine storm

77

together with an altered type I interferon (IFN) response with low IFN production and

78

an altered expression of IFN-regulated genes (Hadjadj et al., 2020; Del Valle et al.,

79

2020). The cytokine storm is characterized by systemic inflammation, hemodynamic

80

instability, hyperferritinemia and multiple organ failure (Moore and June, 2020). Many

81

studies of circulating immune cells by flow and mass cytometry and/or single-cell RNA

82

sequencing have provided valuable insights into immune perturbations in COVID-19

83

(Carissimo et al., 2020; Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020; Kuri-Cervantes et al.,

84

2020; Laing et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020; Sánchez-Cerrillo et al., 2020; Schulte-

85

Schrepping et al., 2020; Silvin et al., 2020; Su et al., 2020; Wilk et al., 2020). Recently,

86

a multi-omics approach study has identified a major shift between mild and moderate

87

disease, in which increased inflammatory signaling correlates with clinical metrics of

88

blood clotting and plasma composition changes, suggesting that moderate disease may

89

be the most effective situation for therapeutic intervention (Su et al., 2020).

90

Lymphopenia, including T and NK cell lymphopenia, is a characteristic of severe

91

COVID-19 (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a). In addition,

92

alterations in the T cell compartment of COVID-19 patients have been described (Kuri-

93

Cervantes et al., 2020; Laing et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b).

94

Among these, an increment in the frequency of activated and proliferating memory CD4

95

T cells and memory CD8 T cells in subsets of patients have been documented (Mathew

96

et al., 2020). Also, T cell exhaustion and increased expression of inhibitory receptors on

97

peripheral T cells have been described (Li et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020; Zheng et

98

al., 2020). Nonetheless, it is important to consider that these inhibitory receptors are

99

also increased after T cell activation (Mathew et al., 2020). Besides the evidences of T

100

cell activation in COVID-19 patients, some studies have found decreases in

101

polyfunctionality or cytotoxicity (Zheng et al., 2020). Other reported alterations in the

102

T cell compartment include, for example, a decrease in γδ T cells (Laing et al., 2020).

103

Related to B cells, it has been described an increase in the circulating plasmablasts and

104

in proliferating B cell subsets, among others (Mathew et al., 2020). Alterations in

105

natural killer (NK) cells during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection have also been reported.

106

For example, reduced NK cell counts in patients with severe COVID-19 and impaired

107

degranulating activity and IFN-gamma production in response to classical targets, such

108

as K562 cells, have been published (Mazzoni et al., 2020; Osman et al., 2020). Other

109

studies have shown that there is an increase in the frequency of NK cells displaying

110

inhibitory receptors, such as NKG2A (Demaria et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Zheng et al.,

111

2020). However, others have described a strong activation of both circulating and lung

112

NK cells and an expansion of adaptive NK cells in patients with severe disease (Jiang et

113

al., 2020; Maucourant et al., 2020).

114

Diverse immune mechanisms are on place to detect viral replication and protect the

115

host. Pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system recognize viral antigens

116

and virus-induced damage, increasing bone marrow hematopoiesis, the release of

117

myeloid cells including neutrophils and monocytes, and the secretion of cytokines and

118

chemokines (Stegelmeier et al., 2019). If the inflammatory condition is not controlled,

119

then emergency hematopoiesis may lead to bystander tissue damage that with the

120

cytokine storm causes organ dysfunction. It is well known that the myeloid

121

compartment is also profoundly altered during SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in

122

patients with severe COVID-19 (Mann et al., 2020; Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020;

123

Silvin et al., 2020). For example, dendritic cells (DCs) were found to be reduced in

124

number and functionally impaired and the ratio of conventional DCs (cDCs) to

125

plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) was increased in patients with severe disease (Zhou et al.,

126

2020b). Some authors have found that pDCs and CD141+ cDCs were equally

127

diminished in patients irrespective of the disease severity, while the decrease in CD1c+

128

cDCs was more evident in patients with severe COVID-19, suggesting that this specific

129

cDC subset migrates to the lungs and other locations (Sánchez-Cerrillo et al., 2020).

130

Regarding circulating monocytes, alterations in the frequency of certain subpopulations

131

have been described, such as transitional (CD14++CD16+) and non-classical

132

(CD14+CD16++) monocytes (Sánchez-Cerrillo et al., 2020; Schulte-Schrepping et al.,

133

2020; Silvin et al., 2020). Some have described that loss of non-classical monocytes

134

could help in the identification of high risk of severe COVID-19 (Silvin et al., 2020).

135

Patients with severe disease are characterized by an accumulation of dysfunctional

136

activated monocytes that express low levels of HLA-DR and immature neutrophils,

137

indicating an emergency myelopoiesis, and an accumulation of these cells in the lungs

138

(Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020; Silvin et al., 2020; Vitte et al., 2020). Severe COVID-

139

19 is also characterized by a profound alteration of neutrophil subsets. Neutrophilia with

140

immature (CD10lowCD101-) neutrophils, indicative of emergency granulopoiesis, and

141

dysfunctional granulocytes are characteristics of patients with severe disease (Silvin et

142

al., 2020). A granulocytic signature has been proposed to identify SARS-CoV-2

143

infected from non-infected people as well as between severity stages (Vitte et al., 2020).

144

Severity was correlated with the expression of PD-L1 in granulocytes from patients

145

with severe COVID-19 (Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020; Vitte et al., 2020).

146

Besides all the published data, there are still aspects not fully characterized in COVID-

147

19 immunopathogenesis. Patients with severe disease exhibit a significant immune

148

dysregulation and the nature of it is not completely understood. An in depth and

149

complete knowledge of the dysregulated immune response is very important not only

150

for its therapeutic implications, but also to better understand the immunopathology of

151

the disease. Therefore, it is essential to entirely define the immune response

152

characteristics related to disease features and determine at which stage of the disease

153

specific therapeutic options may be most effective.

154

We have characterized lymphocytes (T, B and NK cells) and monocytes of patients with

155

mild, moderate and severe disease using flow cytometry-based studies and correlated

156

the results with clinical features and laboratory data. Comprehensive conventional and

157

unsupervised analyses of the results showed that, in addition to others, the activation

158

status of T lymphocytes and an increase in the cytotoxic potential of T and NK cells are

159

correlated with the degree of the disease severity. Furthermore, we also describe an

160

alteration in the expression of CD300 molecules in monocytes and granulocytes that, to

161

our knowledge, was previously unrecognized. This alteration is characterized by an

162

abrupt change in the expression of this family of receptors between patients with

163

moderate and severe COVID-19. Altogether, our results may help physicians to make

164

therapeutic decisions regarding the management of patients with moderate and severe

165

COVID-19.

169

SARS-CoV-2 infection: Study design, clinical cohort and clinical data

170

Our aim was to evaluate the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in circulating

171

leukocytes. To this end, we performed a cross-sectional study. Forty four patients with

172

COVID-19 disease were recruited for the study. To correlate laboratory findings,

173

including frequencies and phenotype of circulating leukocytes and the severity of the

174

disease, we stratified our cohort of COVID-19 patients into 3 groups of those showing

175

mild (15 patients), moderate (15 patients) and severe (14 patients) disease. The

176

demographic, clinical characteristics and clinical laboratory values are summarized in

177

Table S1 and Table S2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were followed to guarantee the

178

homogeneity of the cohort, including age, gender, severity of the disease and time from

179

the onset of symptoms to sample collection. In addition, twelve healthy controls (HC)

180

were included in the study.

181

No significant differences were found between COVID-19 patients and HC in relation

182

to age (median ages of 64 and 59.5, respectively). There were also no significant

183

differences between the three groups of patients (severe, moderate and mild) in relation

184

to the number of days from the appearance of symptoms and the sample collection:

185

median of 8 days for the mild group (range: 0 to 35), 3 days for the moderate group

186

(range: 0 to 15) and 7 days for the severe group (range: 0 to 21). Regarding the gender

187

of the participants, 7 (58.33%) men and 5 (41.66%) women participated in the HC

188

group and 20 men (45.45%) and 24 (54.54%) women in the COVID-19 group (Fig.

189

1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, and in agreement with previous studies (Huang et al., 2020;

190

Mann et al., 2020; Del Valle et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a), we observed an increase

191

in the levels of plasma IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin in COVID-19

192

patients in comparison with HC (Fig. 1B). Specifically, 26% of patients exhibited IL-6

193

levels above the normal range (>40 pg/mL). Interestingly, all HC had IL-6 levels below

194

the limit of detection (<3 pg/mL), while 69% of patients had >3 pg/mL of IL-6. On the

195

other hand, 66% of patients exhibited CRP levels above the normal range (>11 mg/L)

196

and 57% of patients exhibited ferritin levels above the normal range (>300 ng/mL) (Fig.

197

1B). Furthermore, although white blood cell (WBC) counts were mostly normal in mild

198

and moderate COVID-19 patients, some moderate and severe patients exhibited high

199

WBC counts (Fig. 1C). Also, and in accordance with the literature (Hadjadj et al., 2020;

200

Huang et al., 2020), we observed frequencies and absolute numbers of lymphocytes

201

below the normal values, and frequencies and absolute number of neutrophils above the

202

normal values associated with the severity of the disease (Fig. 1C). Finally, increased

203

levels of IL-6 (>40 pg/mL), CRP (>11 mg/L), ferritin (>300 ng/mL), fibrinogen (>400

204

mg/dL) and D-dimer (>500 ng/mL) and lower levels of hemoglobin (<13 g/dL) were

205

observed mostly in moderate and severe patients (Fig. 1D).

206

To examine potential associations between these general laboratory values and other

207

clinical features, we performed correlation analysis (Fig. 1E). The analysis revealed

208

associations between different degrees of severity with clinical features (oxygen

209

therapy, bilateral infiltrations), comorbidities (hypertension), laboratory values (CRP,

210

D-dimer, fibrinogen, hemoglobin), etc. Frequencies and absolute values of different

211

subsets of WBCs were also correlated with severity degrees. Interestingly, the analysis

212

did not reveal a correlation between IL-6 levels with other parameters. Thus, COVID-19

213

patients presented varied and complex clinical phenotypes and laboratory values,

214

including evidences of inflammation and altered leukocyte counts in many patients.

215
216

SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with activated CD4 T cells subsets expressing

217

higher levels of PD-1 and perforin

218

We next performed a detailed multiparametric flow cytometry analysis to further

219

investigate circulating leukocytes status in COVID-19 patients (see gating strategy for

220

each cell population in Fig. S1). Given the important role of T cells in the defense

221

against viral infections and in the establishment of an immunological memory, as well

222

as in the immunopathology and damage that may occur, we studied T cell

223

subpopulations. We did not observe significant differences in the frequency of the major

224

T cells subsets, i.e. CD4, CD8 and double negative (DN) neither in the CD4/CD8 ratio

225

between the patients and compared with the HC (Fig. S2). Four major CD4 T cell

226

subpopulations were examined by using the combination of CD45RA and CD27 to

227

define naïve (CD27+CD45RA+), memory (CD27+CD45RA−), effector-memory

228

(CD27−CD45RA−),

229

(CD27−CD45RA+) cells (Fig. 2A). There were no significant differences in the

230

frequencies of the four subsets between HC and COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, the

231

frequency of CD4 TEMRA cells was highly variable in COVID-19 patients, in which a

232

subset of them was characterized by a relatively high number of this cell type (Fig. 2A).

233

Most viral infections induce proliferation and activation of T cells. The latter is detected

234

by the coexpression of CD38 and HLA-DR (Mathew et al., 2020). We found an

and

terminal

effector-memory

235

expansion in the CD38+HLA-DR+ subset in all the non-naïve CD4 T cell subsets from

236

COVID-19 patients, more significantly in the severe group (Fig. 2B and Fig. S3A). This

237

expansion could be antigen-driven activation, as well as bystander activation and

238

homeostatic proliferation. Nevertheless, the magnitude of CD38+HLA-DR+ cells

239

expansion varied widely in our cohort and is significantly lower than the one observed

240

in CD8 T cells (see below). After antigen recognition and activation, T cells up-regulate

241

the expression of inhibitory receptors, such as programed cell death-1 (PD-1), with the

242

aim of preventing an excessive response that, if not properly regulated, could be

243

harmful to the host (Schönrich and Raftery, 2019). Therefore, in the context of an acute

244

infection, PD-1 could also be considered an activation marker, while during chronic

245

stimulation, T cells became progressively dysfunctional and exhausted, and the

246

expression of PD-1 persists (Schönrich and Raftery, 2019). We studied the expression

247

of PD-1 on CD4 T cells and found that there was an increase in all non-naïve CD4 T

248

cells from patients, which was statistically significant in the effector-memory subset

249

from moderate and severe COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2C and Fig. S3B). Similar to the

250

CD38+HLA-DR+ cells, the expansion of PD-1+ cells varied widely, but importantly a

251

strong positive correlation between CD38+HLA-DR+ cells and PD-1+ cells was

252

observed in COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2D), suggesting the possibility that PD-1

253

expression on CD4 T cells during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is more an activation

254

marker than an exhaustion marker.

255

Given the relevant role of antibodies in the response to SARS-CoV-2, we also analyzed

256

the circulating T follicular helper (TFH) cells (PD-1+CXCR5+) (Crotty, 2019). We did

257

not observe a significant increase, except for the moderate group of patients, in the

258

frequency of TFH in COVID-19 patients (Fig. S3C). Nevertheless, the frequency of

259

CD38+HLA-DR+ TFH cells was expanded in patients, suggesting that they had a recent

260

antigen encounter and have emigrated from the germinal center (Crotty, 2019) (Fig.

261

S3C). In addition, we performed an analysis of B cells and, while the frequencies of

262

CD27- B cells, which include mostly the naïve subset, tended to increase in COVID-19

263

patients, the frequencies of CD27+ memory B cells tended to decrease with the disease

264

severity, although not significantly (Fig. S4A). Contrarily, the frequency of

265

plasmablasts (CD27+CD38+) increased, except in patients with severe disease (Fig.

266

S4A). We also observed a significant decrease in CXCR5 (Fig. S4B) and HLA-DR

267

(Fig. S4C) expression levels in B cells from COVID-19 patients.

268

Cytotoxic CD4 T cells represent an additional mechanism by which CD4 T cells

269

contribute to immunity. In viral infections, these perforin expressing CD4 T cells have

270

been shown to play a protective and/or pathologic role (Broadley et al., 2017; Sanchez-

271

Martinez et al., 2019). Therefore, we measured the expression of perforin in CD4 T

272

cells from COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2E and Fig. S3D). Results showed that the

273

frequency of effector-memory and TEMRA CD4 T cells expressing perforin from a

274

subset of COVID-19 patients was higher than in HC (Fig. 2E). Although the increase in

275

the frequency of the memory cells that express perforin was not statistically significant

276

between COVID-19 patients and HC (Fig. 2E), we observed an enhanced perforin

277

expression per cell basis as shown by an increase in the median fluorescence intensity

278

(MFI) of perforin+ cells (Fig. S3D). Altogether, these results suggest that cytotoxic

279

CD4 T cells may contribute to the clinical course of those patients.

280

To gain more insight, we performed high-dimensional mapping of seven parameters

281

flow cytometry data in non-naïve CD4 T cells. For that, a t-distributed stochastic

282

neighbor embedding (tSNE) representation (heatmap and density plot) of the data

283

highlighted some regions of non-naïve CD4 T cells that were preferentially found in

284

COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2F). Among these, cells expressing CD45RA and perforin

285

were expanded in COVID-19 patients. To further define and also quantify these

286

differences, we performed FlowSOM clustering and compared the expression of the

287

seven markers to define 12 clusters or populations (or Pop) (Fig. 2G). Using this

288

approach we identified several populations differentially expressed between HC and

289

COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2H and Fig. 3SE). For example, Pop10, which identified

290

TEMRA cells (CD27-CD45RA+) expressing perforin, was expanded in patients.

291

Memory cells (CD27+CD45RA-) that express PD-1 and CD38 (Pop0) and PD-1, CD38

292

and HLA-DR (Pop2), as well as CD27-CD45RAlow expressing PD-1, CD38 and HLA-

293

DR (Pop6) were also expanded in COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2H). Thus, COVID-19

294

patients were characterized by expanded populations of activated, PD-1 and perforin

295

expressing CD4 T cells in a subgroup of patients.

296
297

SARS-CoV-2 acute infection is associated with CD8 T cell activation in severe

298

patients.

299

CD8 T cells have a very relevant role in viral infections through their ability to

300

recognize and kill virus infected cells and in the formation of the immunological

301

memory. But also, highly differentiated CD8 T cells have been suggested to induce

302

damage in SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs in an antigen-independent manner (AN and

303

DW, 2020). Therefore, we next examined the four major subpopulations (naïve,

304

memory, effector-memory and TEMRA). We observed no significant differences in the

305

frequencies of naïve, memory and TEMRA subsets between HC and COVID-19

306

patients. Nevertheless, the frequency of CD8 effector-memory cells was significantly

307

higher in patients with severe disease (Fig. 3A).

308

Then, we determined the activation status of CD8 T cells. We observed that COVID-19

309

patients exhibited a significant expansion of activated (CD38+HLA-DR+) cells,

310

especially in the patients with severe disease (Fig. S5A). As in CD4 T cells, this

311

expansion could be not only antigen-driven activation, but also homeostatic

312

proliferation and bystander activation. When we looked at the CD8 T cells subsets,

313

increased frequencies of activated CD8 T cells were also observed in patients, most

314

significantly in those with severe disease (Fig. 3B). The magnitude of the activated cells

315

expansion varied widely, although in a significant subset of patients with severe

316

COVID-19 more than 50% of their memory, effector-memory and TEMRA CD8 T cells

317

were activated compared to less than 10% in all HC (Fig. 3B). We also studied the

318

expression of PD-1 on CD8 T cells (Fig. 3C and Fig. S5B) and although there was a

319

tendency, no significant differences were observed between HC and patients, with the

320

exception of an expansion of PD-1+ CD8 memory cells in patients with severe disease.

321

In contrast to the CD4 T cells, we did not observe a correlation between CD38+HLA-

322

DR+ cells and PD-1+ cells in COVID-19 patients (Fig. S5C), probably suggesting that

323

PD-1 expression on CD8 T cells is more a marker of exhaustion than of activation.

324

Nevertheless, more studies are required to confirm this statement.

325

CD8 T cells exert their cytotoxic activity after encountering virus-infected cells by

326

releasing perforin and granzymes that are contained in their lytic granules (Halle et al.,

327

2017). We next determine perforin expression in our cohort of COVID-19 patients.

328

When we looked at the total CD8 T cell population we observed a significant increase

329

in the frequency of cells containing perforin in patients with severe disease (Fig. S5D).

330

This could be explained by an increased in the frequency of memory and effector-

331

memory cells expressing perforin in severe patients (Fig. 3D). Altogether, these results

332

suggest that an expansion of activated and perforin containing non-naive CD8 T cells

333

may contribute to the severity of the COVID-19 disease.

334

Projecting the non-naïve CD8 T cell subsets into the high-dimensional tSNE space

335

(heatmap and density plot) also identified alterations in the response of these cells

336

during SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with HC (Fig. 3E). Among others, a relevant

337

expansion of activated non-naïve CD8 T cells was observed, more significantly in

338

patients with severe disease. To gain more insight into the CD8 T cell alterations, we

339

again used the FlowSOM clustering tool and compared the expression of several

340

markers to define 12 populations (or Pop) (Fig. 3F). We were able to identify some

341

populations that were differentially expressed between COVID-19 patients and HC

342

(Fig. 3G and S5E). The populations containing the activated cells (Pops 7, 8, 9, 10 and

343

11) were significantly expanded in patients, especially in those with a severe disease.

344

Pop7 identified activated memory CD8 T cells that are PD-1+, while Pop10 represented

345

activated memory CD8 T cells that are PD-1-. Pop8 and Pop9 identified activated

346

effector-memory CD8 T cells that are PD-1- and PD-1+, respectively (Fig. 3G). Pop11

347

identified the activated TEMRA cell subset, that was significantly increased in severe

348

patients, while the frequency of Pop0, which identified the TEMRA non-activated cells,

349

was the same in HC and COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3G and S5E). Pop1 identified the

350

non-activated (CD38-HLA-DR-) and PD-1- memory subset that decreased with the

351

severity of the disease (Fig. S5E). Hence, COVID-19 patients were characterized by an

352

expansion of non-naïve activated CD8 T cells, including both PD-1+ and PD-1- cells.

353

We have also analyzed the DN T cells, and in a similar way to what happens with CD4

354

and CD8 T cells, the activated (HLA-DR+CD38+) and perforin expressing DN T cells

355

are significantly expanded in COVID-19 patients (Fig. S6).

356
357

Activated monocytes, decreased levels of HLA-DR and a shift in CD300 receptors

358

expression pattern correlate with severe COVID-19.

359

The myeloid cell compartment is profoundly dysregulated in patients with severe

360

COVID-19 (Mann et al., 2020; Sánchez-Cerrillo et al., 2020; Schulte-Schrepping et al.,

361

2020; Silvin et al., 2020; Vitte et al., 2020). Among other findings, it has been described

362

an emergency myelopoiesis with accumulation of dysfunctional and immature

363

monocytes that are characterized by low expression of HLA-DR and CD163 (Schulte-

364

Schrepping et al., 2020; Silvin et al., 2020). In relation to the three main monocyte

365

subpopulations (classical, transitional and non-classical), several authors have reported

366

that the frequency of the CD14lowCD16high (non-classical) monocyte subpopulation is

367

decreased in patients with severe disease (Sánchez-Cerrillo et al., 2020; Silvin et al.,

368

2020). In our cohort, we did not observe significant differences in the three main

369

monocyte subsets, with the exception of transitional monocytes in patients with

370

moderate disease (Fig. 4A). CD163 is a receptor expressed on monocytes that has been

371

investigated as a potential inflammation marker in different infectious diseases (Tippett

372

et al., 2011). We found a significant increase in the percentage of CD163+ monocytes in

373

patients with moderate and severe disease (Fig. 4B). This increased frequency was

374

observed in all the monocyte subsets, with a significant number of patients with

375

moderate and severe disease exhibiting more than 40% of CD163+ transitional

376

monocytes (Fig. 4B). Also, as previously published by others (Giamarellos-Bourboulis

377

et al., 2020; Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020; Silvin et al., 2020), we found a gradual

378

decrease in HLA-DR expression levels in all monocyte subsets that correlated with the

379

severity of the disease (Fig. 4C).

380

The CD300 molecules are type I transmembrane proteins expressed on the surface of

381

immune cells that modulate a multitude of signaling pathways and have been found to

382

be involved in several diseases, including viral infections and sepsis (Borrego, 2013;

383

Vitallé et al., 2019; Zenarruzabeitia et al., 2015, 2016). Therefore we decided to

384

determine the expression of the inhibitory receptor CD300a and activating receptors

385

CD300c and CD300e on monocytes from patients with COVID-19 (Fig. 4D). Results

386

showed a differential expression of these receptors between HC and patients. Very

387

interestingly, we observed a sharp shift in the expression of this family of receptors

388

between moderate and severe disease. Specifically, while the expression levels of

389

CD300a and CD300e increased in monocytes from patients with mild and moderate

390

disease, a drastic decrease was observed in patients with a severe form of COVID-19.

391

This decrease in the expression levels reached similar or lower levels than those

392

expressed by patients with mild disease and HC (Fig. 4D). The expression of CD300a in

393

granulocytes (CD66b+ cells) was similar to monocytes, with an increase in patients with

394

mild and moderate disease and then a sharp decline in patients with severe COVID-19

395

(Fig. S7). The expression of CD300c on monocytes exhibited a somewhat opposite

396

pattern to that of CD300a and CD300e (Fig. 4D). In fact, the expression of this marker

397

decreased in all patients, and significantly in those with a moderate disease. Although

398

the mechanism responsible for the altered expression levels of CD300 molecules in

399

patients with COVID-19 it is not known, these results, along with other observations,

400

may be of great importance for distinguishing those patients who have a severe disease

401

from others who have a moderate or mild illness.

402

Next, we performed high-dimensional mapping of the seven parameter flow cytometry

403

data using tSNE representation (heatmap and density plot) and we observed that some

404

regions were preferentially found in patients when compared with HC (Fig. 5A). Then,

405

clustering was performed using FlowSOM and 10 clusters or populations (Pop) were

406

identified and quantified (Fig. 5B). Several populations were differentially expressed

407

between HC and COVID-19 patients (Fig. 5C and Fig. S8). For example, the classical

408

monocytes Pop0 and Pop4, with low expression of HLA-DR, CD300a and CD300e,

409

were significantly expanded in patients with severe disease. Interestingly, Pop0

410

expressed high levels of the CD300c and Pop4 exhibited low levels of this receptor.

411

Pop5 also belongs to the classical monocyte subset and is characterized by higher

412

expression of HLA-DR, low CD300c and medium levels of CD300a and CD300e. In

413

accordance with the results from conventional analysis, Pop5 was most expanded in

414

patients with mild and moderate disease, while the frequency of this population did not

415

change in severe COVID-19 patients when compared with HC. Pop1, which is the

416

predominant population in HC (approximately 50% of monocytes) and is significantly

417

reduced in patients, belongs to the classical monocyte subset and is characterized by

418

high HLA-DR and CD300c expression, intermediate levels of CD300e and high levels

419

of CD300a. Altogether, monocytes from COVID-19 patients have an activated

420

phenotype, a gradual loss of HLA-DR expression that correlates with the severity of the

421

disease and, very interestingly, a shift in the expression of CD300 molecules between

422

moderate and severe disease.

423
424

Perforin and granzyme B armed NK cell subsets are expanded in patients with

425

severe disease.

426

The role of NK cells in the recognition and elimination of virus-infected cells is well

427

documented, as well in modulating the adaptive immune response (Lam and Lanier,

428

2017). But also, uncontrolled NK cell activation may contribute to hyper-inflammation

429

and tissue injury (Li et al., 2012). The exact status of NK cells in SARS-CoV-2

430

infection is not well elucidated and conflicting results related to their phenotype and

431

functionality have been published. Several studies in COVID-19 patients have revealed

432

that circulating NK cells are lower in numbers (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020;

433

Maucourant et al., 2020), displayed an inhibitory-related phenotype and have altered

434

cytotoxic and immunomodulatory functions (Demaria et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020;

435

Mazzoni et al., 2020; Osman et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020). Single-cell RNA

436

sequencing studies have corroborated this trend (Wilk et al., 2020). However, other

437

articles have described a strong activation of both, circulating and lung NK cells

438

measured at protein and RNA levels, as well as an expansion of adaptive NK cells in

439

patients with severe disease (Jiang et al., 2020; Maucourant et al., 2020). Therefore, we

440

decided to perform a phenotypical analysis of NK cells from COVID-19 patients. First,

441

we determined the frequency of the three circulating NK cell subsets, i.e. CD56bright,

442

CD56dim and CD56neg NK cells. CD56bright cells are considered a less mature subset than

443

CD56dim NK cells (Di Vito et al., 2019). Our results showed that there were no

444

significant differences in the frequencies of the three subsets when we compared HC

445

with COVID-19 patients (Fig. 6A).

446

Next, we analyzed the expression of perforin and granzyme B in NK cells (Fig. 6B).

447

Results showed that both CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells from COVID-19 patients

448

exhibited higher levels of perforin and granzyme B as determined by the MFI of these

449

markers. This increase in perforin and granzyme B levels were associated with the

450

severity of the disease (Fig. 6B), suggesting that NK cells from patients with moderate

451

and, even more with severe disease, have the potential to eliminate more efficiently

452

target cells. As a subset, CD56dim NK cells continue to differentiate (Di Vito et al.,

453

2019). During this process, among other phenotypical features, they lose the expression

454

of NKG2A and sequentially acquire CD57 (Di Vito et al., 2019). Therefore, we

455

determined the expression of NKG2A and CD57 on CD56dim NK cells from HC and

456

COVID-19 patients to evaluate their maturation status. Results showed that there were

457

no significant differences in the frequencies of the four subsets between HC and patients

458

(Fig. 6C). Nevertheless, the increased expression of perforin and granzyme B that

459

associated with the severity of the disease was also evident in each of the four subsets

460

(Fig. S9A).

461

We also performed high-dimensional mapping of the eight parameter flow cytometry

462

data using tSNE representation and it was evident that some regions were preferentially

463

found in COVID-19 patients when compared with HC (Fig. 6D). To gain more insight

464

into the NK cell alterations observed in COVID-19, we used the FlowSOM clustering

465

tool and compared the expression of the eight markers to define 16 populations (Fig.

466

6E). Using this approach, we were able to identify some populations that were

467

differentially expressed between COVID-19 patients and HC (Fig. 6F and S9B). Pop6,

468

Pop7 and Pop11 represented CD56dim NK cells with relatively low amount of perforin

469

and granzyme B expression. The frequency of these three populations was significantly

470

higher in HC, while patients with severe disease exhibited a lower frequency. Pop6 and

471

Pop11 are CD57-, while Pop7 is CD57+. Related to the CD56bright NK cell subset, both

472

Pop14 and Pop15 were identified. While Pop14 does not express perforin or granzyme

473

B, Pop 15 expresses high levels of these two cytolytic markers. As expected, the

474

frequency of Pop14 was very low in patients with severe disease, while Pop15 was

475

significantly expanded in severe COVID-19.

476

Despite the classification as innate cells, the discovery of memory properties in NK

477

cells hints the role of this cell type in adaptive immunity and long-term responses

478

(Cerwenka and Lanier, 2016; Lam and Lanier, 2017). In humans adaptive NK cells

479

express NKG2C and lack signaling molecules such as FcRγ (FcεRIγ). It is well known

480

that infection by cytomegalovirus (CMV) induces the expansion of adaptive NK cells

481

(Rölle and Brodin, 2016). At the functional level, they have higher expression of

482

granzyme B, secrete higher levels of IFN-γ and TNF, and are capable of mediating

483

ADCC responses and secrete cytokines against CMV infected cells (Rölle and Brodin,

484

2016). It has been previously described that in patients with severe COVID-19 there is

485

an increase in the frequency of adaptive NK cells in the circulation (Maucourant et al.,

486

2020). Therefore, we studied this NK cell subset in our cohort of patients. First, we

487

determined the frequencies of NKG2C+, FcRγ- and CD57+NKG2C+ subsets within the

488

CD56dim NK cells (Fig. 7A). Results showed that there were no significant differences

489

in the frequency of these subsets, with the exception of an expansion of NKG2C+ and

490

CD57+NKG2C+ cells from patients with moderate disease. When we simultaneously

491

looked at the expression of the NKG2C and FcRγ markers, we could distinguish four

492

subsets: the NKG2C-FcRγ+ subset that represents the conventional NK cells, and the

493

three different subsets of adaptive NK cells, i.e. NKG2C-FcRγ-, NKG2C+FcRγ- and

494

NKG2C+FcRγ+ (Fig. 7B). The conventional NKG2C-FcRγ+ subset was the largest

495

both in patients and HC. The frequency of these four subsets was similar in patients and

496

HC (Fig. 7B and S10A). Nevertheless, the expression of perforin and granzyme B was

497

higher in each adaptive NK cell subset from COVID-19 patients when compared with

498

HC (Fig. S10B).

499

It is well known that human adaptive NK cells are expanded in individuals that are

500

infected by CMV (Lam and Lanier, 2017; Rölle and Brodin, 2016). Hence, we studied

501

adaptive NK cells expansion according to the CMV serology status of patients and

502

healthy controls. As reported by Maucourant et al. (Maucourant et al., 2020), we have

503

determined that there is an expansion of adaptive CD57+ NKG2C+ NK cells when they

504

are more than 5% of circulating CD56dim cells. In addition, we have also determined

505

that there is an expansion of adaptive FcRγ- NK cells when they represent more than

506

7% of the CD56dim cells. Results in Fig. 7C shows that CMV-seronegative individuals

507

do not have expansions of adaptive NK cells, except for one patient with moderate

508

disease, in which the NKG2C+CD57+ cells represented more than 5%, and another

509

patient with severe disease, in which the FcRγ- cells were more than 7%. When only the

510

CMV-seropositive individuals were taken into account, we observed a significant

511

expansion of adaptive NK cells in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19, which

512

was more pronounced when NKG2C+CD57+ cells were taken into account instead of

513

FcRγ- cells (Fig. 7C).

514

Finally, we performed high-dimensional mapping using tSNE representation and we

515

observed that some regions were preferentially found in CMV-seropositive individuals

516

compared with CMV-seronegative donors (Fig. 7D). Then, to better understand the

517

differences in NK cell subsets between CMV-seropositive and CMV-seronegative

518

individuals we used the FlowSOM clustering tool and compared the expression of seven

519

markers to define 8 populations (Fig. 7E). Using this approach, we were able to identify

520

some populations that were differentially expressed between the two groups of donors

521

(Fig. 7F and S10C). Specifically, the adaptive NK cells Pop6 and Pop7 were

522

characterized by the phenotype NKG2C+FcRγ-, and while Pop6 was CD57+, Pop7 was

523

CD57-. As expected, the frequencies of Pop6 and Pop7 were higher in CMV-

524

seropositive HC and COVID-19 patients, although we did not see significant

525

differences.

526
527

Statistical analysis reveals the relationships between circulating T cells, NK cells

528

and monocytes with disease severity in COVID-19 patients.

529

We first performed a bivariate analysis of 203 clinical laboratory and flow cytometry

530

variables (Table S3). We selected the statistically significant variables for a multivariate

531

analysis. Then, to reduce the number of variables to include in the multivariate analysis

532

we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. 8A). Components 1 to 4

533

explained around 73.7% of the variance, and components 1 and 2 explained around

534

60.8% of the variance (Fig. S11A). In Figure S11B the contribution of each variable to

535

components 1 to 4 is shown. The expression of CD300 molecules in monocytes and of

536

granzyme B in CD56bright NK cells are variables, along with the frequency of

537

lymphocytes and neutrophils, that significantly contribute to component 1. For

538

regression models. When we compared patients with a mild disease with those with a

543

moderate or severe disease, results showed that component 1 is significantly different

544

between patients with mild and severe disease, while component 2 is significantly

545

different between patients with mild and moderate disease (Fig. 8B, upper panel). On

546

the other hand, when we compared patients with moderate disease with those with a

547

mild and severe disease, we could see that component 1 was significantly different

548

between patients with a moderate and severe disease and, as expected, component 2 was

549

different between patients with moderate and mild disease (Fig. 8B, lower panel).

550

Next, we performed correlation analysis. A different correlogram pattern was observed

551

between HC and patients groups when we looked at the correlation between the

552

significant flow cytometry variables (Fig. S12). Then, the analysis was performed to

553

look for associations between the general laboratory values, clinical features and

554

degrees of severity with the significant flow cytometry variables (Fig. 8C). Indeed, the

555

correlogram revealed many direct and inverse correlations providing a very valuable

556

insight into the flow cytometry variables that were associated with the degree of

557

severity. Very importantly, a strong direct association of activated T cells and granzyme

558

B expression in CD56bright NK cells with severe disease was observed. Furthermore, and

559

as expected, there was a strong direct association between activated T cells and

560

granzyme B expression in CD56bright NK cells with clinical features of severity such as

561

oxygen therapy, days with oxygen therapy, days in ICU, thrombosis/embolism and

562

bilateral lung infiltrations. Related to clinical laboratory, we observed a direct

563

correlation between activated T cells and granzyme B expression in CD56bright NK cells

564

with ferritin, counts and frequency of neutrophils, D-dimer, and CRP, and an inverse

565

association with hemoglobin and counts and frequency of lymphocytes.

566

On the other hand, a very interesting picture emerged when the expression of CD300

567

receptors on monocytes was taken into consideration. A positive correlation between

568

CD300a and CD300e expression with moderate disease was observed. However, a

569

sharp shift in their correlation was detected in patients with severe disease. In fact, an

570

inverse correlation between CD300a and CD300e expression in monocytes with other

571

clinical features of severity was also observed. We also looked at the expression of

572

HLA-DR in monocytes, and there was also an inverse correlation with clinical features

573

associated to severity such as days in ICU, dead, CRP, D-dimer, etc. Altogether, these

with severe COVID-19.

DISCUSSION

579
580

In this study, we have carried out a phenotypic characterization of circulating immune

581

cells in order to determine correlates that may help to distinguish between degrees of

582

severity in COVID-19. In addition, the findings that we have obtained could shed some

583

light into the underlying mechanisms of the disease immunopathogenesis, especially in

584

severe cases. Among other findings, an increased activation status of all T cell subsets

585

(CD4, CD8, circulating TFH and DN cells) and highly armed cytotoxic cells, mostly

586

NK cells and TEMRA and effector-memory T cells, are characteristics of severe

587

disease. Furthermore, to our knowledge, we have uncovered a previously unrecognized

588

alteration and a sharp shift in the pattern of expression of CD300 receptors on

589

monocytes. Very importantly, conventional and unsupervised analyses lead to very

590

similar conclusions highlighting the relevance of our findings.

591

A possible limitation of our study is the size of the cohort of patients with COVID-19

592

(n=44) and HC (n=12). However, and to avoid problems related to the diversity of

593

participants, we have been very careful in choosing a cohort that is as uniform as

594

possible before we performed the study. Thus, in this way, it is very important to point

595

out that there are no significant differences between the groups of patients in relation to

596

age, gender or between the number of days since the symptoms onset and samples

597

collection.

598

It is widely accepted that immune dysregulation contributes to the pathology seen in

599

severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A consistent finding in many studies, including

600

ours, is that COVID-19 patients display robust activation of the T cell pool, although a

601

considerable portion of patients have minimal levels of activation compared to HC

602

(Mathew et al., 2020). Our study shows that the frequency of activated T cells increases

603

with the degree of severity of the disease. The frequency of activated memory, effector-

604

memory and TEMRA CD4, CD8, DN, and even circulating TFH cells, is increased in

605

patients with severe COVID-19. Furthermore, a very significant correlation was

606

observed between many of these activated T cell subsets with severe disease while, as

607

expected, an inverse association was observed with patients that experienced a mild

608

disease. We also observed that CD4 and CD8 T cells from patients with severe disease

609

tended to have higher levels of perforin. How these activated and perforin containing T

610

cells contribute to the disease pathology is not well known. However, it has been

611

proposed that highly differentiated T cells may induce damage during SARS-CoV-2

612

infection in a mechanism involving the induction of ligands, as for example MICA/B,

613

for activating NK cell receptors in the respiratory epithelium. The recruited terminally

614

differentiated T cells, which among other things are characterized by the expression of

615

high levels of perforin and NK cell receptors, may recognize and induce T cell receptor-

616

independent killing of epithelial cells in the respiratory tract and lungs (AN and DW,

617

2020). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that in patients with severe COVID-19, the

618

expansion of activated T cells, especially the effector-memory and TEMRA cells, have

619

a role in the pathology of the disease. To confirm this affirmation, an in depth analysis

620

of these cell subsets (in blood and tissues) from patients with different degrees of

621

severity is required, including a complete study of their NK cell receptor repertoire. On

622

the other hand, we observed that cytotoxic (perforin containing) CD4 T cells are

623

expanded in a subset of COVID-19 patients. Both protective and pathogenic role for

624

these cells during viral infection have been proposed (Broadley et al., 2017; Sanchez-

625

Martinez et al., 2019). Even more, it has been postulated that an expansion of cytotoxic

626

CD4 T cells drives cardiovascular disease in certain inflammatory conditions and they

627

are triggered by CMV infection (Broadley et al., 2017). There is no doubt that it is

628

necessary to determine if these cytotoxic CD4 T cells have some role in tissue damage

629

and thrombotic complications in COVID-19.

630

Although we did not find a significant increase in the frequency of circulating TFH, it

631

was possible to observe an expansion in a subset of patients. Nevertheless, circulating

632

TFH were more activated in severe COVID-19, suggesting that these CD38+HLA-DR+

633

TFH had a recent antigen encounter and may be providing B cell help (Crotty, 2019),

634

possibly as a part of an extrafollicular response, which somehow is explained by the

635

observed low levels of CXCR5 in B cells from patients with severe disease. It has been

636

shown in other viral infections that activated circulating TFH correlates with blood

637

plasmablasts frequency (Crotty, 2019). We did not observe such correlation and,

638

furthermore, we only saw an increase in the plasmablasts frequency in patients with

639

moderate disease. This is in contrast with other studies (Mathew et al., 2020) and we do

640

not know the reason for this discrepancy. Nevertheless, it is important to point out that

641

we have not determined the specific SARS-CoV-2 plasmablast response, but the

642

frequency of total plasmablasts.

643

Similar to Maucourant et al. (Maucourant et al., 2020), we have also found that

644

COVID-19 patients exhibited expansions of adaptive NK cells as well as highly armed

645

NK cells. Considering that adaptive NK cells are not a uniform NK cell subset (Rölle
21

646

and Brodin, 2016), it is important to point out that we observed the expansions when we

647

use the two more common gating strategies to identify adaptive NK cells:

648

CD57+NKG2C+ cells and FcRγ- cells. What marker is best for the identification of

649

adaptive NK cells is a matter of discussion, but recently it has been shown that editing

650

the FcRγ gene reprograms conventional NK cells to display functional and phenotypical

651

characteristics of adaptive NK cells (Liu et al., 2020). Expansions of adaptive NK cells

652

occurred mostly, but not exclusively, on those individuals that were CMV-seropositive,

653

raising the question of a possible CMV reactivation in COVID-19. However, the lack of

654

proliferation of CMV specific T cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the absence of

655

correlation between the expansions of adaptive NK cells with specific CMV IgG titers

656

argues against the CMV reactivation as the cause (Maucourant et al., 2020; Sekine et

657

al., 2020). Nevertheless, more studies are required to define what drives the expansion

658

of adaptive NK cells in COVID-19 patients.

659

There was an apparent increase in the levels of perforin and granzyme B in NK cells

660

from COVID-19 patients that correlated with the disease severity. This increased

661

arming of NK cells was very evident in the CD56bright subset, which in patients with

662

severe COVID-19 expressed high levels of perforin and even higher of granzyme B.

663

Interestingly, two populations (Pop14 and Pop15) that differed in the expression of

664

perforin, granzyme B and CD16 were identified within the CD56bright NK cells. Some

665

authors have previously suggested that CD56brightCD16+ NK cells represent a more

666

mature stage within the CD56bright subset (Campos et al., 2015). Therefore, we could

667

conclude that in severe COVID-19 there is a shift toward a more mature NK cell within

668

the CD56bright cells. On the other hand, we did not observe a difference in the maturation

669

status of the CD56dim subset according to the expression of NKG2A and CD57.

670

Correlation studies showed a strong association of granzyme B expression in CD56bright

671

NK cells with severe disease as shown by clinical features such as bilateral infiltrations,

672

thrombosis/embolism, oxygen therapy, neutrophilia, etc. A less strong association was

673

also observed when the granzyme B expression in CD56dim NK cells was taken into

674

account. The presence of these highly armed NK cells in patients with severe disease

675

may suggest the possibility to eliminate more efficiently target cells, including virus-

676

infected cells, and activated T cells that may cause immunopathology, and therefore

677

modulate the adaptive immune response (Waggoner et al., 2012). But also, these NK

678

cells can cause tissue damage in a way similar to how respiratory syncytial virus causes

22

679

acute lung damage (Li et al., 2012). Undoubtedly, more studies are required to know

680

how these two aspects of NK cells contribute to the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19.

681

A decrease in non-classical monocytes and an increase in the transitional subset have

682

been associated to a severe and mild COVID-19, respectively (Sánchez-Cerrillo et al.,

683

2020; Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020; Silvin et al., 2020). Although we did not find

684

significant differences between patients and HC in the frequency of monocyte subsets, a

685

tendency to a diminution in the frequency of the non-classical subset and an increase in

686

the transitional monocytes was evident. In agreement with previous results

687

(Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020; Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020; Silvin et al.,

688

2020), we observed a decrease in HLA-DR expression in monocytes. The decrease was

689

gradual and it was very significant in patients with severe COVID-19. HLA-DRlow

690

monocytes are considered dysfunctional and are an established surrogate marker of

691

immunosuppression in sepsis (Venet et al., 2020). Acute infections trigger an

692

emergency myelopoiesis that is characterized by the mobilization of immature myeloid

693

cells, which are linked to immunosuppressive functions (Loftus et al., 2018). Therefore,

694

it is reasonable to propose that an increment in dysfunctional monocytes and an

695

emergency myelopoiesis are factors that contribute to the development of severe

696

disease.

697

The CD300 molecules are type I transmembrane proteins expressed on the surface of

698

immune cells and are divided in two groups: activating and inhibitory receptors

699

(Borrego, 2013). CD300 receptors are able to bind different ligands, mostly lipids such

700

as phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine and ceramide (Borrego, 2013; Izawa

701

et al., 2014; Simhadri et al., 2012; Zenarruzabeitia et al., 2015). They regulate many

702

signaling pathways, as for example monocyte and neutrophil activation (Alvarez et al.,

703

2008; Borrego, 2013; Simhadri et al., 2013; Zenarruzabeitia et al., 2015, 2016). The

704

importance of CD300 molecules in several pathological conditions has been highlighted

705

by multiple studies describing the role of this family of receptors in allergic disorders,

706

autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, cancer, sepsis and viral infections (Borrego,

707

2013; Vitallé et al., 2019; Zenarruzabeitia et al., 2015). In this study we have observed a

708

very intriguing expression pattern of the CD300 molecules in COVID-19 patients. The

709

expression of CD300a and CD300e gradually increased in monocytes and granulocytes

710

from patients with mild and moderate disease. It is well known that activation of

711

neutrophils and monocytes with pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as LPS and GM-CSF,

712

increased the expression of CD300a and CD300e (Alvarez et al., 2008; Zenarruzabeitia
23

713

et al., 2016). Therefore, it is plausible to assume that in patients with moderate and mild

714

disease the increased expression in these two CD300 receptors is a consequence of the

715

inflammatory milieu. However, a sudden change in the pattern of CD300a and CD300e

716

receptors expression happened in patients with severe COVID-19 that exhibited very

717

low levels of these two molecules. The cause for this sharp shift is not known.

718

However, some clues could be found in the HL-60 acute myeloid leukemia cell model

719

to study the differentiation towards monocytes and neutrophils (Alvarez et al., 2008).

720

Undifferentiated HL-60 cell do not express CD300 molecules, but when neutrophil and

721

monocyte differentiation was induced, a significant increase in CD300a cell surface

722

expression was observed, indicating that the CD300a receptor expression is

723

developmentally regulated (Alvarez et al., 2008). Therefore, a possible explanation for

724

the sharp decrease in CD300a expression, and also possibly CD300e, is that the

725

circulating monocytes and granulocytes are more immature (and possibly more

726

dysfunctional) that those observed in mild and moderate COVID-19. This is somehow

727

supported by the lower HLA-DR expression in monocytes from patients with severe

728

disease. Evidently, more studies are required to understand not only the exact

729

mechanisms involved in the regulation of CD300 receptors expression in COVID-19,

730

but also the role that they play in this disease. Besides that, the determination of CD300

731

receptors expression in COVID-19 is very important as the statistical, including PCA

732

analysis, and correlation studies show.

733

In conclusion, the two important findings of this study were that the unsupervised

734

analysis obtained similar results and reached similar conclusions than the conventional

735

analysis, and that the statistical and correlation studies corroborated that several immune

736

alterations were in close relationship with the severity of the disease as shown by the

737

clinical features and clinical laboratory data. This study could be improved in the future

738

by increasing the number of recruited patients, performing longitudinal studies,

739

analyzing in more depth immune cell subsets, as for example terminal differentiated T

740

cells and monocytes, from blood and tissues, obtaining more comprehensive clinical

741

data, etc. Still, our study, along with those published by others, provides a compilation

742

of immune response data that, at least, could help in two ways: first, by providing

743

additional light on the immune mechanisms behind the development of severe COVID-

744

19, and second, with the potential benefit of helping clinicians to decide which

745

therapeutic approach is better for each patient.

749

Patients and healthy donors

750

In this study, we used plasma and whole blood samples cryopreserved in Cytodelics

751

Stabiliser (http://www.cytodelics.com) from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (n=44) and

752

adult healthy donors (n=12). Patients were recruited at Cruces University Hospital. All

755

management, traceability and biosecurity, set out in the Spanish Law 14/2007 of

756

Biomedical Research and in the Royal Decree 1716/2011. Patients recruited into the

757

study tested PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2, except one patient with mild disease, from

758

March to June 2020 and were classified in 3 different clinical severity groups: mild,

759

moderate and severe, according to clinical criteria (see Table S1 and S2). All donors

760

provided written and signed informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of

761

Cell preparation and flow cytometry

765

From each donor a whole blood sample was collected in EDTA, from which one aliquot

766

was centrifuged to obtain plasma and another aliquot was frozen using Cytodelics

767

whole blood cell stabilizer. For extracellular staining, 200μL of blood + stabilizer

768

mixture thawed at 37oC were incubated with the specific antibodies for 23 min at room

769

temperature (RT) in the dark. Next, red blood cells were lysed using 2mL of 1X BD

770

FACS Lysing Solution (BD Biosciences) for 12 min at RT. Cells were washed with

771

PBS containing 2.5% of bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich) and were

772

permeabilized and fixed using Cytofix/Cytoperm Plus Kit (BD Biosciences) following

773

manufacturer´s instructions. Then, intracellular staining was performed using the

774

corresponding antibodies during 30 min at 4ºC in the dark. Lastly, cells were washed,

775

resuspended in 250 µL of PBS and acquired in a LSRFortessa X-20 flow cytometer (BD

776

Biosciences). Three flow cytometry panels were used to study T and B cells, NK cells

777

and monocytes (see Table S4).

780

FCS 3.0 files were exported from the FACSDiva and imported into FlowJo v.10.7.1. for

781

subsequent analysis. The following plug-ins were used: DownSample (1.1), tSNE and

782

FlowSOM (2.6). Manual and automated analyses were performed. For the automated

783

analysis, events were first downsampled from the gates of interest (CD4 T cells, CD8 T

784

cells, B cells, monocytes, NK cells and CD56dim NK cells) across all samples using

785

DownSample plug-in. Then, downsampled populations were concatenated for the

786

analysis. tSNE was run using the parameters indicated in each figure and represented as

787

heatmap and density plot. FlowSOM was run using the same parameters from the tSNE

788

panels.

789
790

Clinical laboratory data

791

Hemograms and serum determinations (D-dimer, ferritin, fibrinogen, CRP, etc.) from

792

all patients were realized at the clinical laboratory of Cruces University Hospital. In

793

addition, IL-6 levels and CMV serology were determined in plasma samples, also at the

794

clinical laboratory of Cruces University Hospital. Samples for all determinations were

795

obtained the same day than samples for flow cytometry analysis.

796
797

Statistical analysis and data representation

798

GraphPad Prism v.8.4.3 was used for graphical representation and statistical analysis.

799

Data were represented as boxplots with the median and 25th to 75th percentiles, and the

800

whiskers denote lowest and highest values. Each dot represented a donor. Significance

801

was determined by the Kruskal-Wallis test adjusting for multiple comparisons using

802

Dunn´s test. For categorical comparisons, the significance was determined by chi-

803

squared test.

804

Correlation plots between variables were calculated and visualized as correlograms

805

using R function corrplot. Spearman´s Rank Correlation coefficient was indicated by

806

square size and heat scale. Significance was indicated by *p <0.05, **p <0.01, ***p

807

<0.001, and ****p <0.0001. p values were adjusted using the Benjamini & Hochberg

808

test.

809

Bivariate analyses were performed (Table S3). First, using the Shapiro-Wilks normality

810

test we determined if variables followed a normal distribution. If they did, the average

811

and standard deviation were reported, and if they did not have a normal distribution the

812

median and interquartile range were indicated. To determine statistical significance, we

813

use the Student's t test if the variable follows a normal distribution and the Mann26

bivariate analysis. To reduce the number of variables to include in the multivariate

analysis we performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Multinomial logistic
