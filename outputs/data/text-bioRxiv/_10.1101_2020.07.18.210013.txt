ABSTRACT

31

The search for successful therapies of infections with the coronavirus SARS-

32

CoV-2 is ongoing. We tested inhibition of host cell nucleotide synthesis as a

33

promising strategy to decrease the replication of SARS-CoV-2-RNA, thus

34

diminishing the formation of virus progeny. Methotrexate (MTX) is an

35

established drug for cancer therapy and to induce immunosuppression. The

36

drug inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and other enzymes required for the

37

synthesis of nucleotides. Strikingly, the replication of SARS-CoV-2 was

38

inhibited by MTX in therapeutic concentrations around 1 µM, leading to more

39

than 1000-fold reductions in virus progeny in Vero C1008 (Vero E6) as well as

40

Calu-3 cells. Virus replication was more sensitive to equivalent concentrations

41

of MTX than of the established antiviral agent remdesivir. MTX strongly

42

diminished the synthesis of viral structural proteins and the amount of released

43

virus RNA. Virus replication and protein synthesis were rescued by folinic acid

44

(leucovorin) and also by inosine, indicating that purine depletion is the principal

45

mechanism that allows MTX to reduce virus RNA synthesis. The combination of

46

MTX with remdesivir led to synergistic impairment of virus replication, even at

47

300 nM MTX. The use of MTX in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections still awaits

48

further evaluation regarding toxicity and efficacy in infected organisms, rather

49

than cultured cells. Within the frame of these caveats, however, our results raise

50

the perspective of a two-fold benefit from repurposing MTX for treating COVID-

51

19. Firstly, its previously known ability to reduce aberrant inflammatory

52

responses might dampen respiratory distress. In addition, its direct antiviral

53

activity described here would limit the dissemination of the virus.

SIGNIFICANCE


MTX is one of the earliest cancer drugs to be developed, giving rise to seven

57

decades of clinical experience. It is on the World Health Organization's List of

58

Essential Medicines, can be administered orally or parenterally, and its costs

59

are at single digit € or $ amounts/day for standard treatment. In case of its

60

successful further preclinical evaluation for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections, its

61

repurposing to treat COVID-19 would thus be feasible, especially under low-

62

resource conditions.

63



Additional drugs exist to interfere with the synthesis of nucleotides, e.g.

64

additional folate antagonists, inhibitors of GMP synthetase, or inhibitors of

65

dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Such inhibitors have been approved

66

as drugs for different purposes and might represent further therapeutic options

67

against infections with SARS-CoV-2

68



Remdesivir is currently the most established drug for treating COVID-19. Our

69

results argue that MTX and remdesivir, even at moderate concentrations, can

70

act in a synergistic fashion to repress virus replication to a considerably greater

71

extent than either drug alone.

72



COVID-19, in its severe forms, is characterized by pneumonia and acute

73

respiratory distress syndrome, and additional organ involvements. These

74

manifestations are not necessarily a direct consequence of virus replication and

75

cytopathic effects, but rather a result of an uncontrolled inflammatory and

76

immune response. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids are thus

77

being evaluated for treating COVID-19. However, this bears the risk of re-

78

activating virus spread by suppressing a sufficient and specific immune

79

response. In this situation, it is tempting to speculate that MTX might suppress

80

both excessive inflammation as well as virus replication at the same time, thus

81

limiting both the pathogenesis of pneumonia and also the spread of virus within

82

a patient.

INTRODUCTION

85

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has so far infected > 12 million people, with > 500,000

86

deaths ascribed to COVID-19 so far (July 2020). The fast spread of the virus, currently

87

most notable in the Americas and south Asia, raises the need for readily available

88

therapies, preferably through drug repurposing. In addition to viral proteins, cellular

89

pathways represent attractive targets, with fewer opportunities for viruses to develop

90

drug resistance.

91

The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 comprises the replication of the viral RNA genome, one

92

of the longest single strand RNA genomes among all viruses. Large amounts of RNA

93

need to be synthesized, often subgenomic for translation at ribosomes, as well as full-

94

length RNA genomes for incorporation into virus progeny. Thus, high amounts of

95

ribonucleotides are required in infected cells for virus replication. This makes

96

nucleotide biosynthesis an attractive target for drugs to interfere with the propagation

97

of the virus in infected individuals.

98

One way of suppressing nucleotide biosynthesis consists in the use of folate

99

antagonists. This class of drugs, upon cellular uptake, diminishes the regeneration of

100

tetrahydrofolate (THF) from dihydrofolate (DHF), and the subsequent transfer of

101

methyl groups required for the synthesis of purine nucleotides, as well as

102

desoxythymidine monophosphate and S-adenosyl methionine. Especially the lack of

103

purine nucleotides can be expected to diminish the synthesis of virus RNA. Folate

104

antagonists have not been broadly evaluated as antivirals, with the exception of some

105

flaviviruses (Beck et al., 2019; Fischer et al., 2013). In contrast, sulfonamides and

106

trimethoprim are routinely used for treating bacterial infections, and their mechanism

107

of action is to prevent the synthesis of folic acid in bacteria (Estrada et al., 2016).

108

Methotrexate (MTX), along with the closely related aminopterin, represents the most

109

established antifolate to act on eukaryotic cells. They belong to the earliest cancer

110

drugs whatsoever, since they were first characterized by Sidney Farber and

111

colleagues in the forties of the last century (Farber et al., 1948), and have been in

112

clinical use ever since. They were first applied at high doses to treat leukemia as well

113

as solid malignancies. Later, however, they were found to suppress the inflammatory

114

and immune response even at low doses (Cronstein and Aune, 2020). Until today,

115

MTX is broadly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, and

116

it is also part of current standard anti-cancer regimens. It is bioavailable orally and

117

parenterally, inexpensive, and, with seven decades of clinical use, one of the best-

118

characterized drugs in the clinics. Its disadvantages are often a result of long-term

119

treatment, which would not be necessary in the case of treating an acute virus

120

infection. Of note, however, pregnancy is a contraindication for MTX, due to its

121

negative impact on fast-proliferating embryonal cells (Weber-Schoendorfer et al.,

122

2014). Moreover, high doses of MTX can cause severe mucositis (den Hoed et al.,

123

2015). Thus, therapies with MTX do require close monitoring by trained personnel.

124

Here we show that MTX reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication up to 1000-fold, at

125

concentrations that are clinically achievable, in Vero cells as well as Calu-3 cells that

126

resemble bronchial epithelial cells. This effect of MTX can be largely ascribed to

127

impaired purine synthesis. Furthermore, MTX synergizes with the antiviral purine

128

analogue remdesivir to diminish virus replication. This raises the perspective that MTX

129

might not only reduce inflammation in the context of COVID-19 but also display a direct

130

antiviral impact.

MATERIALS & METHODS

133
134

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND METHODS

135

Cell culture

136

Vero E6 cells (Vero C1008) were kindly provided by C. Stahl-Hennig, German Primate

137

Center Göttingen, Germany. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s

138

medium (DMEM with GlutaMAXTM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum

139

(Merck), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Gibco), and 10 µg/ml

140

ciprofloxacin (Bayer) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The human

141

lung epithelial cell line Calu-3 was purchased from ATCC (HTB-55) and maintained in

142

Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal

143

bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were routinely tested and ensured to

144

be negative for mycoplasma contamination.

145
146

Virus stock production

147

SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from a patient sample taken in March 2020 at Göttingen,

148

Germany. Throat swab material was mixed with medium containing 2% fetal bovine

149

serum and used to inoculate Vero E6 cells for five days. The supernatant was

150

passaged twice more to expand the virus. This cell culture supernatant was used as

151

virus stock in all experiments.

152
153

Treatments and SARS-CoV-2 infection

154

30,000 cells per well were seeded into 24-well-plates using medium containing 2%

155

fetal bovine serum and incubated for 8 hours at 37 °C. Cells were treated with

156

methotrexate (Selleckchem S1210), remdesivir (Selleckchem S8932), leucovorin

157

(Selleckchem S1236) and inosine (Selleckchem S2442) at the concentrations

158

indicated in the figure legends. When preparing stock solutions, methotrexate and

159

remdesivir were dissolved in DMSO; leucovorin and inosine in water. After 24 hours,

160

the cells were infected with virus stocks corresponding to 3*107 RNA-copies of SARS-

161

CoV-2 and incubated for 48-72 hours at 37 °C.

163

Quantitative RT-PCR for virus quantification

164

For RNA isolation, the SARS-CoV-2 containing cell culture supernatant was mixed

165

(1:1 ratio) with the Lysis Binding Buffer from the Magnapure LC Kit # 03038505001

166

(Roche) containing > 3 M guanidine thiocyanate (GTC), and the viral RNA was isolated

167

using Trizol LS. After adding chloroform, the RNA-containing aqueous phase was

168

isolated, and RNA was precipitated using isopropanol. The RNA pellet was washed

169

with ethanol, dried and resuspended in nuclease-free water. Quantitative RT-PCR was

170

performed according to a previously established RT-PCR assay involving a TaqMan

171

probe (Corman et al., 2020), to quantify virus yield. The following primers were

Immunofluorescence analyses

175

8,000 Vero E6 cells per well were seeded onto 8-well chamber slides (Nunc) and

176

treated/infected as indicated. After 48 hours, the cells were fixed with 4%

177

formaldehyde in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton

178

X-100 in PBS for 30 minutes and blocked in 10% FBS/PBS for 10 minutes. Primary

179

antibodies were used to stain dsRNA (SCICONS J2 #10010200, 1:500) as well as the

180

SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S; GeneTex #GTX 632604, 1:2000) and Nucleoprotein (N; Sino

181

Biological #40143-R019, 1:5000) overnight. Secondary Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-

182

mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 546 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, 1:500) antibodies

183

were added together with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 1.5 hours at room

184

temperature. All antibodies were diluted in blocking solution. Slides were mounted with

185

Fluorescence Mounting Medium (DAKO) and fluorescence signals were detected by

186

microscopy (Zeiss Axio Scope.A1).

188

ATP quantification by luminometry

189

30,000 Vero E6 cells per well were seeded into 24-well plates, treated with DMSO or

190

MTX and infected with SARS-CoV-2 as indicated. After 48 hours, the cells were lysed

191

with the Lysis Binding Buffer from the Magnapure LC Kit 03038505001 (Roche)

192

containing > 3 M guanidine thiocyanate (GTC), and ATP levels were quantified by

193

adding luciferase as well as luciferin to a 1 µl sample of the lysate, using 100 µl of the

194

CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay solution (Promega), followed by

195

luminometry using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Berthold).

196
197

Immunoblot analysis

198

Cells were washed once in PBS and harvested in radioimmunoprecipitation assay

199

(RIPA) lysis buffer (20 mM TRIS-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-

200

X 100, 1% deoxycholate salt, 0.1% SDS, 2 M urea) in the presence of protease

201

inhibitors. Samples were briefly sonicated to disrupt DNA-protein complexes. The

202

protein extracts were quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher

203

Scientific). Protein samples were boiled at 95 °C in Laemmli buffer for 5 min, and equal

204

amounts were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis

205

(SDS-PAGE). Subsequently, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose

206

membrane, blocked in 5% (w/v) non-fat milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 for 1

207

hour and incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight followed by incubation

208

with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rabbit or donkey anti-

209

mouse IgG, Jackson Immunoresearch). The proteins were detected using either Super

210

Cell counts (Celigo)

214

Vero E6 cells were seeded into 24-well-plates and treated/infected as indicated. After

215

fixation of the cells and Hoechst staining to visualize nuclear DNA, the numbers of

216

nuclei were counted using the Celígo® S Imaging Cytometer (Nexcelom Bioscience).

217
218

RNA Sequencing and NGS data analysis

219

Quality and integrity of RNA were assessed using the Fragment Analyzer (Advanced

220

Analytical) and the standard sensitivity RNA Analysis Kit (DNF-471). RNA-seq libraries

221

were prepared using a non stranded RNA Seq, massively-parallel mRNA sequencing

222

approach (Illumina; TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit v2, Set A; 48 samples, 12

223

indexes, Cat. N°RS-122-2001). Specifically, we first optimized the ligation step diluting

224

the concentration of adaptors to increase ligation efficiency (>94%), and we reduced

225

the number of PCR cycles (10 cycles) to avoid PCR duplication artifacts as well as

226

primer dimers in the final library product. Libraries were prepared on an automated

227

device (Beckman Coulter’s Biomek FXP workstation). For accurate quantitation of

228

cDNA libraries, a fluorometry-based system, the QuantiFluor™dsDNA System

229

(Promega) was used. The size of final cDNA libraries was determined using the

230

dsDNA 905 Reagent Kit (Fragment Analyzer from Advanced Bioanalytical) revealing

231

sizes of 280 bp on average. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina

232

HiSeq 4000 analyzer (PE; 1 x 2x150 bp; 80 Mio reads/sample). Sequence images

233

were transformed using the software BaseCaller (Illumina) to obtain BCL files, which

234

were demultiplexed to FASTQ files using bcl2fastq v2.20.

235

Analysis of sequencing data was performed on the high-performance computing

236

cluster provided by the Gesellschaft für wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH

237

Göttingen (GWDG) using the software Xshell® 6 for Home/School (NetSarang

238

Computer Inc.). FASTQ files were subjected to quality control using FASTQC/0.11.4

239

(Babraham Bioinformatics) prior to trimming using FASTX/0.0.14 (Hannon Lab)

240

according to following thresholds: first base to keep: 15, last base to keep: 140.

241

Trimmed read pairs were mapped against the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 reference

242

genome (accession number: NC_045512.2) (Wu et al., 2020) using BOWTIE2/2.3.4.1

243

(Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) with the --very-sensitive end-to-end setting. Resulting

244

SAM files were processed using SAMTOOLS/1.9 (Li, 2011). In short, SAM files were

245

converted into BAM files using samtools view, followed by merging of technical

246

replicates using samtools merge. The resulting BAM files were sorted according to

247

read names using samtools sort with the -n option and mate-scores were added to

248

each read pair using samtools fixmate. The resulting BAM files were subsequently re-

249

sorted according to genomic coordinates using samtools sort, PCR duplicates were

250

removed using samtools markdup with default settings, and the corresponding index

251

files were generated using samtools index. Sequencing depth was determined using

252

samtools depth and the average read coverage per base was calculated taking the

253

average sequencing depth for all positions across the reference genome. Genomic

254

tracks of mapped reads were calculated using the bamCoverage function of

255

DEEPTOOLS/3.0.1 (Ramirez et al., 2016) with the following settings: -e 100, --

256

ignoreDuplicate, --smoothLength 60, --binSize 20, --samFlagInclude 64. SNPs

257

present in the isolated virus were identified using bcftools mpileup with default settings,

258

followed by bcftools call with -mv and -Ob settings of BCFTOOLS/1.9 (Samtools).

259

Identified variants were filtered and converted into VCF files using bcftools view with

260

the -i ‘%QUAL>=150’ setting. Genomic tracks as well as VCF files were visualized

261

using the Integrative Genomics Viewer v2.3 (Robinson et al., 2017; Robinson et al.,

262

2011; Thorvaldsdóttir et al., 2013).

263
264

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

265

Statistical testing was performed using Graph Pad Prism 6 (RRID:SCR_002798). A

266

two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test was calculated. Significance was assumed where

267

p-values ≤ 0.05. Asterisks represent significance in the following way: ****, p ≤ 0.0001,

268

***, p ≤ 0.005; **, p ≤ 0.01; *, p ≤ 0.05.

RESULTS

271

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 produces >106 copies of genomic virus RNA per cell.

272

We isolated SARS-CoV-2 from a patient sample taken in March 2020 at Göttingen,

273

Germany. Throat swab material was used to inoculate Vero C1008 cells (i.e. Vero E6

274

cells; shortly termed Vero cells from here on). The supernatant was passaged twice

275

more to expand the virus, and cell supernatant was subjected to deep sequencing

276

analysis. More than 80*106 reads, 2*150bp each, were taken and aligned with the

277

published genome sequence of the first Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 (Wu et al.,

278

2020). >97% of all reads corresponded to the virus. Comparing the Göttingen and

279

Wuhan strains, only 8 nucleotide deviations were found (Fig. 1A). Most of these

280

deviations were from C to U, arguing that they might have occurred through RNA

281

deamination rather than misincorporation by the polymerase. Among the deviations

282

was a nucleotide exchange leading to the mutation D614G in the Spike (S) protein that

283

was recently reported to increase the number of S proteins displayed on the viral

284

envelope (Li et al.; Zhang et al., 2020). Of note, however, no change in the coding

285

region for the furin cleavage site of the S protein (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,

286

2020; Ogando et al., 2020) was observed.

287

Next, we detected and quantified the viral RNA released from infected cells. With

288

decreasing virus inoculate, the yield of virus progeny after two days first remained at

289

a maximum and then steeply decreased (Fig. 1B). The decrease in virus yield was

290

more than linear compared to the decrease in inoculum. This could not solely be

291

explained by the presence of defective virus particles. Rather, we propose that more

292

than one virus particle might be required for the productive infection of a cell, leading

293

to a more than proportional decrease in infectivity with lower virus concentrations.

294

Quantitative RT-PCR with comparison to a standard (kind gift by the M. L. Schmidt,

295

Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany) revealed that up to 4*106 copies of viral

296

genomic RNA were released from each cell in the infected culture. Given the length of

297

the viral genome of roughly 3*104 nucleotides, this suggests that one infected cell

298

needs to produce at least 3*4*1010 = 1,2*1011 nucleotides for virus RNA synthesis –

299

and this does not include subgenomic virus RNA to encode virus proteins, nor negative

300

strand RNA intermediates. Hence, virus production requires about 20 times more

301

nucleotides than the replication of the cellular genome (6*109 nucleotides in a diploid

302

human cell). By this calculation, the demand of virus replication on nucleotide

303

biosynthesis corresponds to more than three times of what is needed for the re-

304

synthesis of all ribosomal RNAs, assuming 5*106 ribosomes per cell (Lewin, 1994;

305

Milo et al., 2010) and 7*103 ribonucleotides per ribosome. Considering these numbers,

306

we reasoned that nucleotide biosynthesis might represent a limiting factor for virus

307

replication, and hence a suitable drug target.

308
309

MTX strongly diminishes virus yield upon infection with SARS-CoV-2.

310

As a strategy to interfere with nucleotide biosynthesis, and hence with virus replication,

311

we treated Vero cells with MTX before and during infection with SARS-CoV-2.

312

Strikingly, the treatment with MTX strongly antagonized the infection. MTX largely

313

prevented the cytopathic effect (CPE) observed in infected cells, whereas up to 10 µM

314

MTX did not produce obvious morphologic signs of cytotoxicity (Fig. 2A), in agreement

315

with a previous preliminary report (Xing et al., 2020). The amount of virus RNA

316

released into the media was reduced up to 1000-fold by MTX in Vero cells (Fig. 2B),

317

and the effective concentration of MTX was around 1 µM, which was lower than the

318

effective concentration of the established antiviral drug remdesivir, i.e. 3 µM (Fig. 2B).

319

MTX diminished SARS-CoV-2 progeny even at 100 nM concentration when using

320

Calu-3 cells (Fig. 2C), a cell line that can be used to model bronchial epithelia (Foster

321

et al., 2000). Taken together, these results indicate that MTX is a potent inhibitor of

322

SARS-CoV-2 replication.

323
324

In the presence of MTX, far lower amounts of double stranded RNA and virus

325

proteins accumulate in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.

326

To obtain a first idea about the stage of the infectious cycle affected by MTX, we

327

detected double stranded RNA (dsRNA; an intermediate of virus RNA replication) as

328

well as the viral proteins, upon treating the cells with MTX and infecting them with

329

SARS-CoV-2. The amount of viral S and N proteins, as well as the accumulation of

330

dsRNA, were severely reduced by MTX (Fig. 3A, B). This argues that not just the

331

release of virus particles is diminished by MTX, but also the earlier steps of the

332

infectious cycle, i.e. the synthesis of RNA and virus proteins.

334

MTX does not reduce the levels of its target dihydrofolate reductase in SARS-

335

CoV-2-infected cells, but it strongly decreases the amount of cellular ATP.

336

One of the major targets of MTX is dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). To test if MTX

337

can affect the levels of DHFR, we performed immunoblot analyses of Vero cells that

338

were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and/or treated with MTX. We found infected cells to

339

express the virus N and S proteins, whereas the amounts of these virus proteins were

340

strongly diminished by MTX (Fig. 4A), as expected from the corresponding

341

immunofluorescence analyses shown in Fig. 2B. In contrast, the levels of DHFR were

342

not grossly affected by virus infection. However, MTX led to an increase of detectable

343

DHFR, in mock-infected as well as virus-infected cells. Such an increase of DHFR

344

upon MTX treatment has been described before and might be explained by increased

345

translation and/or stability of DHFR in the presence of a folate antagonist (Hsieh et al.,

346

2009). This observation suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection does not overcome the

347

adaptive increase in DHFR levels upon treatment of cells with MTX.

348

Next we asked whether purine synthesis might be diminished by MTX treatment in the

349

context of infection. One key product of purine synthesis is represented by ATP. To

350

determine ATP levels in MTX-treated and/or virus-infected cells, we rapidly lysed the

351

cells in a chaotropic buffer, followed by dilution and addition of luciferin and luciferase

352

to cell lysates, and luminometry. In this assay system, the levels of ATP are directly

353

reflected by the extent of luminescence. Simultaneously, we determined the

354

corresponding cell numbers by DAPI-staining of cell nuclei and automated

355

quantification. When calculating the relative amount of ATP per cell, we found that

356

MTX reduced ATP levels about three- to fivefold (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, ATP levels

357

per cell were about two-fold higher in infected vs. non-infected cells, and reductions

358

by MTX were only seen at higher concentrations of MTX. Nonetheless, MTX at 1 µM

359

or higher concentration was capable of reducing ATP levels more than 5-fold in

360

infected cells, suggesting that MTX impairs purine synthesis even upon infection with

361

SARS-CoV-2.

363

Folinic acid as well as purine nucleoside rescue virus replication in the presence

364

of MTX.

365

MTX interferes with a number of metabolic steps (Fig. 5A) after cellular uptake and

366

polyglutamation (Alqarni and Zeidler, 2020; Bedoui et al., 2019; Cronstein and Aune,

367

2020). First and foremost, it inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (Nichol and

368

Welch, 1950; Osborn et al., 1958). However, purine synthesis is inhibited by MTX even

369

under conditions when the directly required folate metabolite, 10-formyl-THF, is largely

370

preserved in its levels (Allegra et al., 1986). This argues that MTX diminishes purine

371

synthesis, at least to a substantial extent, by direct inhibition of one of its metabolic

372

steps.

373

phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide (AICAR) transformylase (ATIC) (Allegra

374

et al., 1985b; Baggott et al., 1986).

375

MTX, when polyglutamated, also inhibits thymidylate synthetase (TYMS) directly

376

(Allegra et al., 1985a; Borsa and Whitmore, 1969), which, along with the depletion of

377

5,10 methylene THF, further diminishes the synthesis of deoxythymidine

378

monophosphate (Chu et al., 1990). This then reduces the availability of

379

deoxythymidine triphosphate, which is required for the synthesis of DNA but not RNA.

380

Finally, MTX also acts as an inhibitor of methylene tetrahydrofolate-reductase

381

(MTHFR) (Chabner et al., 1985). In addition to the shortage of the MTHFR substrate

382

5,10 methylene THF, this direct inhibition reduces the regeneration of methionine from

383

homocysteine. Methionine is required to synthesize S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a

384

necessary substrate of methylations of proteins (e.g. histones) as well as the RNA 5’-

385

cap. Given these diverse mechanisms of action by MTX, we performed rescue

386

experiments to elucidate the mechanism(s) required to interfere with virus replication.

387

First, we added folinic acid (leucovorin) to the cells along with the MTX treatment.

388

Remarkably, this fully rescued virus replication. Folinic acid is readily converted to 5,10

389

methylene THF, thus re-supplying the source of methylation required by all MTX-

390

inhibited reactions (Chan and Cronstein, 2010). The rescue strongly suggests that the

391

impact of MTX on virus replication is indeed due to its competition with endogenous

392

folic acid and its metabolism (Fig. 5B).

393

Moreover, the addition of inosine restored virus replication in the presence of MTX

394

(Fig. 5C). Both leucovorin and inosine were also capable of re-establishing the

395

synthesis of virus N and S proteins (Fig. 5D). Inosine is rapidly converted to inosine

396

monophosphate (Chan and Cronstein, 2010; Kozminski et al., 2020), which otherwise

397

represents the end point of purine synthesis. This indicates that purine synthesis,

398

rather than the supply of thymidine or SAM, is critical for virus replication. From this,

399

the reduced supply of ribonucleotides appears as the dominating mechanism of action

400

allowing MTX to act in an antiviral fashion.

401
402

Remdesivir synergizes with MTX to antagonize SARS-CoV-2 replication.

403

Remdesivir is currently the most advanced antiviral drug for clinical use against SARS-

404

CoV-2 infection (Wang et al., 2020). It resembles a purine nucleoside and acts as an

405

adenosine analogue to inhibit viral RNA polymerase. Since MTX diminishes the

406

amounts of available ATP in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Fig. 4B), we reasoned that it

407

might increase the incorporation of remdesivir and hence its antiviral activity. To test

408

this, we first determined suboptimal concentrations of MTX and remdesivir to

409

moderately diminish virus replication. Then, we treated Vero cells with the drugs at

410

these concentrations, alone or in combination, followed by infection with SARS-CoV-

411

2. And indeed, while each drug alone reduced the virus RNA in the cell supernatant

412

(reflecting viral progeny) by roughly 50%, the combination of both drugs led to a

413

reduction by more than 90% (Fig. 6A). Similarly, virus proteins were still detectable

414

when the cells had been treated with single drugs at these concentrations, but the drug

415

combination virtually extinguished the corresponding immunofluorescence signals

416

(Fig. 6B). We conclude that MTX enhances the efficacy of remdesivir, leading to

417

synergistic therapeutic efficacy.

419

DISCUSSION

420

Our results indicate that MTX efficiently inhibits the propagation of SARS-CoV-2, at

421

least in the cell culture systems under study here. The inhibitory effect of MTX primarily

422

relies on reduced purine synthesis. Moreover, MTX was combined with remdesivir to

423

yield synergistic virus inhibition. Pending further testing in animals, these results are

424

compatible with the idea of repurposing MTX as a drug for treating and/or preventing

425

COVID-19, combining its known anti-inflammatory with the here-described antiviral

426

effect.

427

The principle of limiting nucleotide synthesis to interfere with virus replication might be

428

further expanded to treat COVID-19. To limit the synthesis of guanine nucleotides, the

429

enzyme inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) can be inhibited by

430

mycophenolic acid, an established drug in the clinics (Allison and Eugui, 1996).

431

Furthermore, pyrimidine synthesis can be reduced by inhibitors of orotate synthesis,

432

targeting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Besides teriflunomide, an

433

approved immunomodulatory drug, novel DHODH inhibitors are in current clinical

434

testing for treating cancer and leukemia (Madak et al., 2019) and might be re-purposed

435

for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections as well, e.g. through a recently announced phase

436

I trial (NCT04425252).

437

A reduction in available nucleotides may affect the synthesis of viral RNA not only

438

through the kinetics of RNA polymerase. Given the strong impact of MTX on virus

439

yield, with complete rescue by inosine, we speculate that low nucleotide

440

concentrations may trigger regulatory signaling pathways for adapting the viral life

441

cycle to such conditions. Such signaling pathways, as revealed by phosphoproteomics

442

and metabolomics (Bojkova et al., 2020; Bouhaddou et al., 2020; Stukalov et al.,

443

2020), might provide opportunities to further interfere with the replication of SARS-

444

CoV-2.

445

In addition to purine synthesis, MTX also limits the transfer of C1 bodies (methyl

446

groups) through MTHFR to regenerate S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a major

447

substrate for methyltransferases in the cell (Cronstein and Aune, 2020). Since SAM is

448

required for the capping of the viral (as well as cellular) RNA (Viswanathan et al.,

449

2020), this might further limit the production of infectious RNA. Indeed, the

450

characterization of cellular metabolomics in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and

451

the observed reduction in spermidine, at least suggested that SAM levels were

452

reduced in infected cells (Gassen et al., 2020). However, based on the fact that the

453

purine nucleoside inosine was capable of rescuing virus replication (Fig. 5C), we

454

propose that the lack of purine synthesis represents the major mechanism of how MTX

455

limits SARS-CoV-2 replication.

456

Using MTX against other viruses has been considered previously. As early as in 1957,

457

it was reported that a folate antagonist was capable of protecting mice from infections

458

with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV; a member of the arenaviridae), while

459

this was reverted by leucovorin (at that time still called “citrovorum factor”) (Haas et

460

al., 1957). Moreover, MTX is capable of interfering with the replication of Zika virus,

461

another positive strand RNA virus, and a member of the flaviviridae family of viruses

462

(Beck et al., 2019). There, again, rescue with leucovorin and adenosine indicated

463

reduced purine synthesis as the primary mechanism of action. However, at least to

464

our knowledge, MTX has not been broadly used as an antiviral drug. We speculate

465

that it might be usable against other viruses with large burst sizes and corresponding

466

demand of nucleotides as well. Of note, other flaviviridae, i.e. Dengue and West Nile

467

Virus, were also found susceptible to treatment with MTX, whereas Sindbis and

468

Vesicular Stomatitis Virus were not (Fischer et al., 2013). It thus remains to be

469

determined whether MTX might also interfere with the replication of other RNA as well

470

as DNA viruses.

471

With seven decades of clinical experience, MTX is one of the most established drugs

472

whatsoever, available at low costs, making its potential use for treating COVID-19

473

relatively straightforward. Having said this, a number of caveats still apply. Firstly, the

474

dose of MTX that would be needed for antiviral treatment is probably higher than the

475

typical dose taken by patients for the purpose of long-term anti-inflammation

476

treatment. Plasma concentrations in patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis, typically

477

taking 7.5 mg/week for months or even years, are only around 25 nM (Hornung et al.,

478

2008), which is unlikely to interfere with virus replication. On the other hand, when

479

applying high-dose therapies, up to 1000 µM plasma concentrations are achievable

480

(Comandone et al., 2005), i.e. 1000-fold more than what would be required for the

481

antiviral effect in our study. Under such circumstances, a limiting toxicity would consist

482

in mucositis, which is often observed when treating leukemia with high-dose MTX in a

483

pediatric setting (den Hoed et al., 2015).

484

Antiviral activities of MTX would presumably require an intermediate shortterm dose

485

for a week or two. The antiviral concentration of MTX (> 1 µM) is achieved, for instance,

486

by single intramuscular application of 50 mg MTX, which is a common procedure to

487

induce abortions at early stages of pregnancy (Creinin and Vittinghoff, 1994). In this

488

setting, tolerable side effects were reported, e.g. transient nausea, diarrhea, and

489

headache (Creinin and Krohn, 1997). This comparison, on the other hand, makes it

490

very clear that antiviral doses of MTX are contraindicated in pregnant women.

491

A clinical study using nanoparticle-coupled MTX for treating COVID-19 was registered

492

at clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04352465. Moreover, clinical studies using intermediate-to-

493

high dose therapy with MTX were recently proposed for COVID-19, purely based on

494

the rationale of immunosuppression by MTX (Frohman et al., 2020a; Frohman et al.,

495

2020b). Our findings that MTX also interferes with virus replication further argues in

496

favor of such clinical studies.

497

As with other antiviral drugs such as remdesivir, the timing of the therapeutic

498

intervention appears critical. At stages where the COVID-19 symptoms are fully

499

established, virus propagation may already have surpassed its peak. The disease is

500

then mostly caused by excessive inflammatory responses in the lung, as well as

501

intravasal blood coagulation. This argues in favor of early treatment with drugs that

502

interfere with virus replication, to avoid spreading of the infection in the first place.

503

On the other hand, MTX may benefit COVID-19 patients not only through its direct

504

impact on virus replication. Rather, MTX has long been known to suppress the immune

505

response by diminishing the proliferation of B and T cells, which may reduce the

506

pathogenesis of immune-driven lung pathology. While immune suppression would

507

otherwise bear the risk of further virus propagation, our results strongly suggest a

508

direct impact of MTX on viral RNA synthesis. This might allow two benefits at once,

509

i.e. lower virus spread and lower immune reaction. Finally, MTX not only reduces the

510

adaptive immune response, but also the inflammatory reaction, e.g. through

511

extracellular release of adenosine (Cronstein et al., 1991) as well as by diminishing

512

the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (Thomas et al., 2015). Indeed, the targeted JAK-

513

STAT inhibitor baricitinib was reported to be beneficial for COVID-19 patients

514

(Richardson et al., 2020), and combining baricitinib with MTX was suggested recently

515

(Seif et al., 2020); furthermore, the reduction of the inflammatory response may also

516

explain the benefits of corticosteroids in the management of COVID-19 (Li et al., 2020).

517

So far, the use of MTX in patients with rheumatoid arthritis was at least reported to be

518

of no detrimental effect when these patients had COVID-19 (Sanchez-Piedra et al.,

519

2020). However, none of these studies was aiming at a direct antiviral effect of the

520

drugs. According to the results presented here, MTX would have the additional

521

advantage of interfering with virus replication itself.

522

The clinical efficacy of MTX against SARS-CoV-2 replication might be further

523

enhanced through the combination with antivirals such as remdesivir. We propose that

524

this combination might work in a more than additive fashion, but by a mechanistic

525

synergism. Specifically, the reduction in available purine nucleotides might enhance

526

the likelihood of incorporating remdesivir or similar antiviral drugs and their active

527

metabolites into the nascent viral RNA. In any case, treatment with remdesivir andMTX

528

might not only be tolerable but serve to potentiate antiviral efficacy.

529

In summary, albeit solely based on cell culture experiments so far, our study raises

530

the possibility of using MTX, alone or in combination with remdesivir, to limit the

531

replication of SARS-CoV-2 in patients, with the possible additional benefit of its

532

immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects to reduce the pathogenesis of

533

COVID-19. Pending further preclinical evaluation, repurposing the established drug

534

MTX for treating COVID-19 might be beneficial.

782

Germany) and a non-infected cell monolayer (neg. Ctrl), mapped against the Wuhan-

783

Hu-1 reference genome (NC_045512.2). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
