ABSTRACT

20

SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific antibodies contribute the majority of the

21

neutralizing activity in most convalescent human sera. Two SARS-CoV-2

22

variants, N501Y.V1 (also known as B.1.1.7 lineage or VOC-202012/01) and

23

N501Y.V2 (B.1.351 lineage), reported from the United Kingdom and South

24

Africa, contain several mutations in the receptor binding domain of Spike and

25

are of particular concern. To address the infectivity and neutralization escape

26

phenotypes potentially caused by these mutations, we used SARS-CoV-2

27

pseudovirus system to compare the viral infectivity, as well as the

28

neutralization activities of convalescent sera and monoclonal antibodies

29

(mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our results showed that N501Y Variant

30

1 and Variant 2 increase viral infectivity compared to the reference strain

31

(wild-type, WT) in vitro. At 8 months after symptom onset, 17 serum samples

32

of 20 participants (85%) retaining titers of ID 50 >40 against WT pseudovirus,

33

whereas the NAb titers of 8 samples (40%) and 18 samples (90%) decreased

34

below the threshold against N501Y.V1 and N501Y.V2, respectively. In addition,

35

both N501Y Variant 1 and Variant 2 reduced neutralization sensitivity to most

36

(6/8) mAbs tested, while N501Y.V2 even abrogated neutralizing activity of two

37

mAbs. Taken together the results suggest that N501Y.V1 and N501Y.V2

38

reduce neutralization sensitivity to some convalescent sera and mAbs.

INTRODUCTION

42

Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that contain the

43

largest known RNA genomes to date. As severe acute respiratory syndrome

44

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to circulate in the human population,

45

multiple mutations accumulate over time, which may affect its transmission,

46

virulence and antigenicity. Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) elicited by natural

47

infection or vaccination are likely to be a key immune correlate for protection

48

against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Decline of antibodies response to

49

SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent individuals and reinfections by different

50

viral-variants have been reported 1–3. It is therefore important to gain insights

51

into infectivity and antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

52
53

Spike-specific antibodies contribute the majority of the neutralizing activity in

54

most convalescent human sera. Two SARS-CoV-2 variants, N501Y.V1 (also

55

known as B.1.1.7 lineage or VOC-202012/01) and N501Y.V2 (B.1.351 lineage),

56

reported from the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa, contain several

57

mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike and are of particular

58

concern. To address the infectivity and neutralization escape phenotypes

59

potentially caused by these mutations, we used SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus

60

system to compare the viral infectivity, as well as the neutralization activities of

61

convalescent sera and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2

62

variants.

METHODS

64

The blood samples (n = 40) of 20 patients with COVID-19 obtained in February

65

and October 2020 in Chongqing were previously reported.2 Eight RBD-specific

66

mAbs with neutralizing capability against SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from the

67

blood samples of COVID-19 convalescent patients.4 DNA sequences encoding

68

reference strain (wild-type, WT) and mutant Spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2

69

were codon-optimized and synthesized by Sino Biological Inc (Beijing, China)

70

and GenScript Inc (Nanjing, China). Using luciferase-expressing lentiviral

71

pseudotype system, we expressed WT, N501Y.V1 (Variant 1) and N501Y.V2

72

(Variant 2) mutant Spike proteins in enveloped virions, respectively. The

73

neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were measured by pseudovirus-based assays

74

in 293T-ACE2 cells. The inhibitory dose (ID 50 ) was calculated as the titers of

75

NAbs.

The study was approved by the Ethics Commission of Chongqing Medical

79

University (reference number 2020003). Written informed consent was waived

80

by the Ethics Commission of the designated hospital for emerging infectious

81

RESULTS

84

First, the infectivity of pseudotyped viral particles were measured by luciferase

85

assay as previously described.5 As shown in Fig.1a, the entry efficiencies of

86

Spike pseudotyped viruses bearing N501Y Variant 1 or Variant 2 mutant were

87

about 3 to 4.4 times higher than that of the WT pseudovirus when viral input

88

was normalized, suggesting that these spike variants promote the infectivity of

89

SARS-CoV-2. Then, we assessed the neutralizing efficacy of 40 convalescent

90

serum samples from 20 individuals at two time points with pseudovirus

91

neutralization assay. At follow-up time point 1, corresponding to a median of 25

92

days (range 5–33 days) post-symptom onset, most sera were significantly less

93

effective in neutralizing the N501Y Variant 1 and Variant 2 compare to WT

94

pseudovirus (Fig. 1b). The mean nAb titers were 825 for WT, 343 for Variant 1,

95

and 148 for Variant 2. The neutralizing activity of 2 samples against N501Y.V1

96

was reduced by >10-fold. Notably, the NAb titers of 6 samples (30%)

97

decreased below the threshold against Variant 2 (Fig. 1b). At follow-up time

98

point 2 (about 8 months post-symptom onset), 17 samples of 20 participants

99

(85%) retaining titers of ID 50 >40 against WT pseudovirus, whereas the NAb

100

titers of 8 samples (40%) and 18 samples (90%) decreased below the

101

threshold against N501Y Variant 1 and Variant 2, respectively (Fig. 1c). These

102

data indicate that N501Y Variant 1 and Variant 2 escape from neutralizing

103

antibodies in some COVID-19 convalescent sera.

105

In addition, we assessed the impact of these variants on neutralizing activity of

106

human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from COVID-19 convalescent

107

patients. All eight antibodies potently neutralized the WT pseudovirus, while

108

two mAbs (CQ016 and CQ045) are only minimally affected by the variants.

109

However, the neutralization activities of six mAbs were reduced or abolished

110

by either N501Y Variant 1 or Variant 2 (Fig. 1d). Among them, three mAbs

111

were less effective against N501Y.V1 and five against N501Y.V2 by 3-folds or

112

more (Fig. 1d). Notably, two mAbs (CQ026 and CQ038) showed no

113

neutralizing activity to N501Y.V2. Moreover, the Variant 2 reduced the

114

neutralization sensitivity with the most potent mAb CQ046 by 26 folds,

115

compared with that of WT pseudovirus. The IC 50 of mAb CQ046 increased

116

from 7.4 ng/ml (WT) to 194 ng/ml (Variant 2) (Fig. 1e). Together, both N501Y

117

Variant 1 and Variant 2 reduced neutralization sensitivity to most mAbs tested,

118

while N501Y.V2 even abrogated neutralizing activity of two mAbs.

DISCUSSION

122

Our findings indicated that N501Y Variant 1 and Variant 2 increase viral

123

infectivity compared to the reference strain in vitro. Notably, both N501Y

124

Variant 1 and Variant 2 contain the D614G and N501Y mutations in Spike

125

protein. The findings that Variant 1 and Variant 2 enhanced the infectivity of

126

SARS-CoV-2 in vitro are highly consistent with previous studies, which

127

demonstrated that D614G and N501Y mutations enhanced the fitness and

128

transmissibility of the virus as evidenced by structure analysis and the

129

increased number of clinical cases.6,7 Another key question is whether some

130

mutations may enable immune evasion. It is reported that neutralization

131

escape mutants can be selected by passaging virus in the presence of NAbs.8

132

Here, we observed that two naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants, N501Y

133

Variant 1 and Variant 2, were more resistant to neutralization by some mAb

134

and convalescent sera from patients that were infected in mid- to late- January

135

2020 when a ‘first wave’ virus was mainly circulating in China. Consistently,

136

Spike variants with the H60/V70 deletion or E484K mutation have significantly

137

reduced susceptibility to neutralization by the polyclonal serum antibodies of

138

some individuals.9,10 Whether these patients were at high risk of reinfection

139

with ‘second wave’ variants should be explored in further studies. It is also

140

urgent to assess the effectiveness of currently authorized vaccines against

141

these variants.

143

Collectively, this study will be helpful for understanding SARS-CoV-2 infectivity

144

and for the design of vaccines against COVID-19. Given the evolving nature of

145

the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, antibody therapeutics and vaccine

146

development require further considerations to accommodate mutations in

147

Spike that may affect the antigenicity of the virus. Limitations of this study

148

include its small sample size and the use of non-replicating pseudovirus

149

system. Therefore, further studies with authentic SARS-CoV-2 viruses are

150

required.
