ABSTRACT:
COVID-19 is a newly communicable disease with a catastrophe outbreak that affects all over the
world. We retrieved about 8,781 nucleotide fragments and complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2
reported from sixty-four countries. The CoV-2 reference genome was obtained from the National
Genomics Data Center (NGDC), GISAID, and NCBI Genbank. All the sequences were aligned
against reference genomes using Clustal Omega and variants were called using in-house built
Python script. We intend to establish a user-friendly online resource to visualize the variants in
the viral genome along with the Primer Infopedia. After analyzing and filtering the data globally,
it was made available to the public. The detail of data available to the public includes mutations
from 5688 SARS-CoV-2 sequences curated from 91 regions. This database incorporated 39920
mutations over 3990 unique positions. According to the translational impact, these mutations
include 11829 synonymous mutations including 681 synonymous frameshifts and 21701
nonsynonymous mutations including 10 nonsynonymous frameshifts. Development of SARSCoV-2 mutation genome browsers is a fundamental step obliging towards the virus surveillance,
viral detection, and development of vaccine and therapeutic drugs. The SARS-COV-2 mutation
browser is available at http://covid-19.dnageography.com.

INTRODUCTION:
The novel seventh strain of Coronaviridae associated with sever human to human transmission
tentatively named 2019-nCoV that was officially declared a public health emergency of
international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 31, 2020 [1]. Later
on, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
announced the name SARS-CoV-2 “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2” on 11
February 2020. Moreover, on the same day, the World Health Organization declared it a
pandemic disease caused by the virus was “COVID-19” [2, 3]. The number of people infected
with Coronavirus 19 will soon touch the five million mark in 209 countries including Pakistan.
The first two cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Karachi and Islamabad by the Ministry
of Health [4]. Although, COVID-19 is most prevalent in Pakistan as compare to other South East
Asian countries [5]. To date, 27thMay, 2,940,406 active cases, 357,894 (6.16%) deceased and
2,514,950 (43.26%) recovered has been reported worldwide [6].
The SARS-CoV-2 is the 3rd most highly virulent strain of coronavirus that causes severe
respiratory disease followed by SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus) and
MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) with highest fatality rate [7, 8]
while other members of this family 229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1 primarily involve in mild selflimiting disease such as “common cold” in the human population [9].
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome was sequenced and submitted to the NCVBI GenBank (NC045512) on 12 January 2020 that consists of 29,903bp with close resemblance of SARS-CoV.
Coronavirus recognized as highly evolving viruses, consists of non-segmented, positive-sense
single-stranded RNA, with a high frequency of mutation and genomic recombination, [10, 11].
The virus genome is arranged in the order of 5’UTR (untranslated region), ORF1ab (open
reading frame), 3’UTR, and nonstructural ORFs. ORF1ab encodes replicase polyprotein pp1a
and pp1b, proteolytic cleavage of these two viral polyproteins produced 16nsp (nonstructural
proteins) - Club shaped structural glycoprotein spikes(S) that gives the virus crown-like
appearance- Envelope protein(E) - Membrane protein(M) - Nucleocapsid protein (N) [12].
The study on the hotspot of differences in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is very important for
investigating the etiology, epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of coronavirus infection. We

aim to develop the SARS-CoV-2 mutation Browser v-1.3 that retrieved the full-length viral
genome sequence data from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Global
Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) and NGDC databases from all over the world
to find the mutation or polymorphism in SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. This mutation browser will
help the scientists and researchers to investigate the variation in the whole genome of SARSCoV-2. Based on these findings, biomedical companies are also trying to develop rapid
molecular diagnostic kits, vaccines, and therapeutic drugs for SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Results
A total of 12,743 sequences collected from 105 regions (77 countries) were analyzed and filtered
to acquire 8471 high coverage sequences containing 61917 mutations within 5415 mutating
positions and an information browser was made available/accessible to the public. According to
the translational impact, these mutations include 17,912 Synonymous mutations including 936
Synonymous Frameshifts and 33,823 Non-Synonymous Mutations including 17 NonSynonymous Frameshifts.
Numbers of isolates with a certain number of mutations are also displayed in the browser and are
given in Table 1. Most of the isolates with a count of 1047 have 6 mutations and terminals of the
given range have the least number of mutations. This data is evident that the majority of
sequences have lesser than ten mutations.
Mutation Browser is also furnished with a panel for range selection to visualize the number of
variations within that particular range. Users can also directly select gene regions to visualize the
number of mutations of transcribing genomic positions. An exemplary illustration of this
visualization is given in Figure1.
Another important tool in the mutation browser is “Primer Infopedia” where the incorporation of
available primers for COVID-19 sequence amplifications to select their regions directly from the
list and visualize the mutation details of those regions along with the details of geographical
regions curated from sequence information. This utility helps a lot for a quick review of the
reliability of the primers for the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

Discussion
Healthcare professionals and evidence-based medical experts of different countries launched the
COVID-19 information portal which aggregates immediate information updates related to
COVID-19 pandemic from reliable sources (Ref).These COVID-19 dashboards and portals
provide general information about disease epidemiology, symptoms, diagnosis, preventive
measure, medication as well as morbidity and mortality ratio [13, 14]. Along with these general
COVID-19 portals, there was also dire need to launch a diagnostic-based portal that facilitates
the researchers and scientists to develop the state of art molecular detection assays, vaccines, and
therapeutic drugs against COVID-19. In the current situation of the COIVD-19 pandemic, we
have developed and launched the SARS-CoV-2 mutation Browser v-1.3 on date 28-Feb-2020
that is updated regularly.
The SARS-CoV-2 mutation browser is easy, efficient, and user friendly that only deals with
novel coronavirus and display the viral genome variation around the globe on a single platform
for the convenience of the researchers and virologists through World Wide Web http://covid19.dnageography.com. The browser features comprehensive integration of a genomic sequence
of SARS-CoV-2along with their metadata information from NGDC, NCBI, and GISAID.
Furthermore, it is open access mutation browser that displays the region and gene-wise (5UTR,
ORFab, S, E, M, N, 3UTR) distribution of mutation data of particular virus isolate and also
provides position and statistics of mutations. Moreover, viral primer sequence information is also
displayed on the same page “primer infopedia”. The mutation browser has close resemblance
with a Chinese“2019nCOVR” 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource browser with additional
functions like it deals with all coronavirus family, retrieved the viral genome sequence data from
NCBI, GISAID, NMDC and CNCB/NGDC [15].
The evolution rate of coronavirus could be 10-4 substitute per bp per year as a typical RNA virus
therefore; the mutation could be occurring during each replication cycle [9]. However, in the
present bio-information browser, 5688 SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences from ninety-one regions
were examined and a total of 39920 mutations were found. Importantly, the database showed
position and type of mutation, consequence, and consequence type in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
Therefore, to avoid false-negative results, data from this database will be helpful to design the
PCR primers and probes with maximum specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-

19. A potential limitation of this mutation browser is that since all SARS-CoV-2 genome
sequences used in this study were retrieved from different databases and the accuracy of these
genome sequences could not be verified although these partial or complete sequences have been
published worldwide.
In conclusion, the COVID-19 mutation browser is a worthful addition to the currently available
coronavirus resources that will allow the researchers to access data expeditiously and intuitively
on SARS-CoV-2 mutation. We expect the SARS-CoV-2 mutation browser will assist the process
of study design and be a key resource for the COVID-19 community.
Materials and Methods:
Study Design:
Data Collection and Multiple Sequence Alignment:

A total of 12,743 high coverage complete genomes of SARS CoV-2 isolates from 77 countries
(105 regions) were retrieved from GISAID.org [16]. Complete detail about the origin of each
sequence is given in Supplementary Table 1. The reference genome sequence of the virus was
also retrieved from NCBI-GenBank (GenBank: MN908947.3) [17, 18]. All of these viral
genome sequences were aligned with reference sequence in different sets by using Clustal
Omega Server provided by EMBL-EBI [19, 20].

Processing of Aligned Sequences

The aligned sequences were processed by an in-house python script to extract mutations and
filter sequences. Based on a filter over the number of differences, only high-quality sequences
with a max of 20 differences were selected for the database. Our python script could only call all
the variants except deletions at terminal regions of aligned sequences and where nucleotide
changes to “N” (Unknown nucleotide). This script was also programmed to select and curate
mutations only from those sequences having the utmost 20 mutations and no addition greater
than two base pairs.

Annotation of Nucleotide Mutations:

All the nucleotide variations were also annotated for their translational consequences along with
consequence types. For achieving this milestone, an in-house built database was generated
having the annotations of each known consequence permutation and then a python script was
written to annotate each mutation and curate its consequence and consequence type.
Development of Mutation Browser

The SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Browser v.1.3 has been generated the viral genome sequences data
with different types of mutations. Two viral genome sequences of Pakistani isolates retrieved
from NCBI were also processed through the same procedure and are provided separately on the
browser. This browser is coded using modern programming languages including HTML5,
JavaScript, JQuery, PHP, and equipped with MySQL server for rapid retrieval of information.
This browser is designed to provide the user with visualizations of region-wise differences, Gene
wise differences, Hotspot of differences in Genome, Consensus sequence, and all differences of a
sample from reference genomes and their consequence along with summarized information
represented in tabulated format. This portal is also coded to show some basic stats of isolates
regarding several mutations and genomic positions concerning the number of mutations with the
integration of Google Charts.
Primer Infopeida:
All the primers reported for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and research purposes were manually
curated from literature and websites. All these primers were aligned to the reference sequence
using the NCBI BLAST tool to select fully reference mapping primers and curate them with their
regions according to the reference sequence. Mutations Database and Primers Database were
then integrated into another “Primer Infopedia” tool that is also a part of SARS-CoV-2 Mutation
Browser v.1.3.
