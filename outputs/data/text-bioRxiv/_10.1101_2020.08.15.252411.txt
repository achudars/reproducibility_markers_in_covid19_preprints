Abstract
In this paper, the 1D Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima lines (WTMM) method is used to
investigate the Long-Range Correlation (LRC) and to estimate the so-called Hurst exponent of
21 isolate RNA sequence downloaded from the NCBI database of patients infected by SARSCoV-2, Coronavirus, the Knucleotidic, Purine, Pyramidine, Ameno, Keto and GC DNA coding
are used. Obtained results show the LRC character in the most sequences; except some
sequences where the anti-correlated or the Classical Brownian motion character is observed,
demonstrating that the SARS-Cov2 coronavirus undergoes mutation from a country to another or
in the same country, they reveals also the complexity and the heterogeneous genome structure
organization far from the equilibrium and the self-organization.
Keywords: DNA, WTMM, Hurst exponent, NCBI, SARS-CoV-2, mutation, complexity,
heterogeneity.

1 Introduction
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae family
causes an illness called COVID-19, which can spread from person to person (Conway, 2020). It
has many symptoms such as fever, headache, and tiredness. It causes respiratory difficulties that
can cause death, especially for people which health chronic difficulties such as diabetes, arterial
hypertension, heart and pneumonic illness. Until now, there is no proven anti-viral or vaccination
for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Fractal character of nucleic acids distribution in DNA sequences has been widely studied by the
scientific community; many papers have been published in literature. Arneodo et al (1996)
published a paper deals with the study of the Long-Range Correlation (LRC) character of DNA
sequences using the 1D continuous wavelet transform method. Zu-Guo et al (2002) introduced a

time series model in a statistical point of view and a visual representation in a geometrical point
of view to DNA sequence analysis, they have also used fractal dimension, correlation dimension,
the Hurst exponent and the dimension spectrum (multifractal analysis) to discuss problems in
this field. Cattani (2010) published a paper deals with the digital complex representation of a
DNA sequences and the analysis of existing correlations by wavelets. The symbolic DNA
sequence is mapped into a nonlinear time series. By studying this time series the existence of
fractal shapes and symmetries will be shown. Eight H1N1 DNA sequences from different
locations over the world are analyzed. Audit et al (2001) studied the Long-Range Correlations in
Genomic DNA and the signature of the Nucleosomal Structure. Audit et al (2004) published a
paper deals with wavelet Analysis of DNA bending profiles reveals structural constraints on the
evolution of genomic sequences, Voss (1996) published a paper deals with the evolution of
Long-Range fractal correlations and 1/f noise in DNA base sequences.
In this paper the 1D Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima Lines (WTMM) method is used to
demonstrate the monofractal behavior of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences downloaded from the
NCBI database and to estimate the so-called Hurst exponent, the goal is to investigate the LRC
character in these sequences. We begin by describing the different DNA coding that will be
used.

2 Different DNA coding
Many DNA coding of the nucleic acids formed by four different nucleotide which are the
Thymine (T), the Guanine (G), the Cytosine (C), the Adenine (A) have been proposed in
literature, here we will use the following six coding (Messaoudi et al, 2012):
1)

The Knucleotidic DNA coding: T=2, G=-2, A=1, C=-1.

2)

Purine coding A=G=1 , C=T=-1

3)

Pyrimidine C=T=1, A=G=-1.

4)

Ameno groupe: A=C=1, G=T=-1.

5)

Keto coding G=T=1, A=C=-1.

6)

GC coding G=C=1, A=T=-1.

3 Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima lines and LRC in DNA sequences
The 1D Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima lines (WTMM) method is a wavelet based
multifractal analysis formalism introduced by Arneodo et al (1995), the algorithm of the WTMM
is composed with five steps which are:
1-Calcultation of the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) which is a function of time or the
space and the scale.
2-Calculation of Maxima of the Modulus of the CWT
3-Calculation of the function of Partition , .
4-Estimation of the spectrum of exponents .
5-Estimation of the spectrum of singularities  .
For more details about the 1D WTMM method we invite readers to the paper of Arneodo et al
(1996) or Ouadfeul and Aliouane (2011).
One of the most important strengths of the WTMM method is the ability to identify the mono or
the multifractal behavior of a given fractal process, the linear shape of the spectrum of exponents
(



1 is enough to say that a given fractal process is monofractal ( is the Hurst

exponent). For more details about this ability, we invite readers to the papers of Ouadfeul and
Aliouane (2011).
Audit et al (2004) showed that there has been intense discussion about the existence, the nature
and the origin of LRC in DNA sequences in last decades. Besides Fourier and autocorrelation
analysis, different techniques including mutual information functions, DNA walk representation,
Zipf analysis and entropies were used for statistical analysis of DNA sequences. Actually, there
were many objective reasons for this somehow controversial situation. Most of the investigations
of LRC in DNA sequences were performed using different techniques that all had their own
advantages and limitations. They all consisted in measuring power-law behavior of some
characteristic quantity, e.g., the fractal dimension of the DNA walk, the scaling exponent of the
correlation function or the power-law exponent of the power spectrum. Therefore, in practice,
they all faced the same difficulties, namely finite size effects due to the finiteness of the
sequence. Authors of this paper demonstrated the necessity of the wavelet transform microscope
to study the LRC character of DNA sequences.

Estimated Hurst exponent H of the DNA walks using the wavelet transform method is able to
say that a given DNA walk is an anti-correlated random walk (H <1/2: anti-persistent random
walk), or positively correlated (H > 1/2: persistent random walk). H = 1/2 corresponds to
classical Brownian motion (Audit et al, 2004).

4 Data analysis and results discussion
In this part, 21 isolate RNA sequence are analyzed using the 1D WTMM method, these
sequences are extracted from 21 GenBank downloaded from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, All these RNA sequences are of peoples infected
by SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus, table 01 shows the code of each GenBank and the origin
(Country) of each patient infected by this virus. These RNA profiles are coded using the six
coding methods detailed above. Then, the 1D WTMM analysis is applied to these sequences to
estimate the so-called Holder exponent for each coded DNA profile. Figure 01 shows the RNA
Knucleotidic coding with 512bp as a length, the DNA walk of this sequence is presented in
figure 02, the DNA walk at the position n is defined as the sum ‡Ø°

‚àë‡Ø°‡Øú‡≠Ä‡¨µ ‡Øú where ‡Øú

‡Øú , ‡Øú , ‡Øú , ‡Øú }. For more details about DNA Walk, we invite readers to the paper of Peng (1992).
To demonstrate the fractal behavior of this DNA walk, we calculate the spectral density

||‡¨∂ of this sequence and we present the spectral density versus the frequency in the log-log
scale (Voss, 1992).It is clear that log(||‡¨∂  has a linear shape (see figure 3), which

0.4) (Arneodo et al, 1995).

The first step is the Continuous Wavelet Transform calculation, the analyzing wavelet is the
Complex Morlet, for more details about the CWT calculation, parameters of the analyzing
wavelet, and the scaling method, we invite readers to the paper of Ouadfeul and Aliouane (2011).
Figure 4 shows the modulus of CWT, then maxima of the modulus of the CWT are calculated;
graph of chains of maxima is called Skelton, figure 5 exhibits the Skelton of the modulus of the
CWT. Then, the function of partition is calculated on the (q,a) domain, where a is the dilatation
and q is a scale parameter, for a good WTMM analysis and a high capacity of the WTMM
method to identify the mono and multifractal behavior of these RNA coded sequences we take in
consideration only the q scale parameter interval [-0.5,+0.5] (Ouadfeul and Aliouane, 2011).

linear behavior with equation 



1. H is the Hurst exponent (slope of the straight

line) which is equal to 0.55 for this sequence.
The calculated value of the Hurst exponents demonstrates the mono-fractal behavior of the
SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence (which is in agreement with Audit et al (2004) that have
demonstrated the monofractal behavior of human and animal DNA and virus RNA sequences),
this value demonstrates also the LRC character of this RNA profile.
Same procedure is applied to the 21 RNA sequences for each RNA coding method, table 01
shows the estimated Hurst exponents, obtained results clearly show the Long-Range Correlation
(persistent random walk) for the most RNA sequences except for the Genbanks LC529905.1,
MN985325.1, and MT093571.1 (Knucleotidic Coding) ; MT126808.1, MT066175.1,
LC529905.1, MN985325.1, MT093571.1 and MN994467 (Ameno group coding); MT066156.1
and MT044257 (GC coding) where the RNA profiles exhibit a classical Brownian motion
behavior (

0.5. Obtained results demonstrate also that the RNA profiles MN994467,

MT072688, MT007544.1, MT012098.1, MT121215.1, MT198652, MT192773.1 exhibit an anticorrelated random walk behavior (anti-persistent random walk) for Knucleotidic Coding.
Obtained Hurst exponents by the 1D WTMM method have the same values for the same coding
in some countries, for example in Knucleotidic coding the Genbank of the following locations
have the same Hurst exponent: (Italy, USA Illinois), (Japan, China: Wuhan, China: Shenzhen,
China : Beijing, Brazil, Taiwan); (USA : California, Nepal, Australia Victoria, India: Kerala
State, China Changai, Spain : Valencia, Viet Nam) which confirm the possibility of mutation of
SARS-CoV-2 virus. Audit et al (2004) debated LRC character in DNA profiles and demonstrated
that this character is not a simple reason of text and character replication in DNA sequences but
it is due to Bacterial/Viral signature in human/animal cells.
They have demonstrated also that the choice of the DNA coding method is very important to
extract the Bacterial/Viral signature.
Cattani (2010) demonstrated that the concentration/replication and hidden symmetries of the four
nucleic acids in DNA maps built from DNA profiles and the fractal signature in these maps is a
strong indicator of H1N1 viral infection, he has demonstrated also that the wavelet-based fractal
analysis of DNA profiles extracted from these maps is also a strong indicator of H1N1 viral
infection.

Table 02 shows the average value of the Hurst exponent for each coding method of the 21 RNA
GenBank, we can observe that the Purine (sensitive to A and G concentrations) and the
Pyrimidine (sensitive to C and T concentrations) have the smallest Hurst exponent variation
compared to Ameno (sensitive to A and C concentrations) and GC coding which have the
highest variation of the Hurst exponent.

5 Conclusions
We have performed a 1D wavelet based multifractal analysis of 21 RNA profiles downloaded
from the NCBI database using the continuous wavelet transform, the analyzing wavelet is the
complex Morlet, the analyzing parameters of the wavelet transform modulus maxima lines
method have been optimized by Ouadfeul and Aliouane (2011) in previous works related to the
analysis of geophysical signals. Six coding methods are used; the goal is to investigate the LongRange Correlation character in RNA SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus genomes. Obtained results
demonstrate the LRC character in the most sequences; except some sequences where the anticorrelated or the Classical Brownian motion characters are observed. Obtained results
demonstrate also that the SARS-CoV-2 undergoes mutation, varying from a country to another
or varying in the same country like China.
Average value and variations of the Hurst exponent for each coding method of the 21 GenBank
reveal the complexity and the heterogeneous genome structure organization far from the
equilibrium and the self-organization.
. We recommend extending the multifractal analysis to the 2D domain; this can be realized by
the use of 2D Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima lines method which has proven its
robustness in many fields and branches of sciences.
