Abstract

2

The Coronaviridae are a family of viruses with large RNA genomes. Seven coronaviruses

3

(CoVs) have been shown to infect humans, including the recently emerged severe acute

4

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease of 2019

5

(COVID-19). The host response to CoV infection is complex and regulated, in part, by

6

intracellular antiviral signaling pathways triggered in the first cells that are infected. Emerging

7

evidence suggests that CoVs hijack these antiviral responses to reshape the production of

8

interferons and proinflammatory cytokines. Processing bodies (PBs) are membraneless

9

ribonucleoprotein granules that mediate decay or translational suppression of cellular mRNAs;

10

this is particularly relevant for proinflammatory cytokine mRNA which normally reside in PBs

11

and are repressed. Emerging evidence also suggests that PBs or their components play important

12

direct-acting antiviral roles, providing a compelling reason for their frequent disassembly by

13

many viruses. No information is known about how human CoVs impact PBs. Here, we provide

14

data to show that infection with the human CoV, OC43, causes PB disassembly. Moreover, we

15

show that several SARS-CoV-2 gene products also mediate PB loss and virus-induced PB loss

16

correlates with elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs that would normally be

17

repressed in PBs. Finally, we demonstrate that stimulating PB formation prior to OC43 infection

18

restricts viral replication. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs disassemble PBs

19

during infection to support viral replication and evade innate immune responses. As an

20

unintended side effect, the disassembly of PBs enhances translation of proinflammatory cytokine

21

mRNAs which normally reside in PBs, thereby reshaping the subsequent immune response.

Introduction

26

PBs are ubiquitous, biomolecular condensates that form via liquid-liquid phase separation of

27

proteins with regions of intrinsic disorder, and from RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions

28

(1-5). PBs are comprised of the enzymes required for mRNA turnover, including those needed

29

for decapping (Dcp2 and co-factors Dcp1a and Edc4/Hedls) and decay of the RNA body (5’-3’

30

exonuclease Xrn1 and RNA helicase Rck/DDX6) and some components of the RNA-induced

31

silencing complex (2,6). The RNA found in PBs consists of one third of all coding transcripts

32

which are poorly translated and non-coding RNAs (2,4,7,8). mRNA transcripts, consisting

33

predominantly of grouped regulatory mRNAs with related biological functions, are delivered to

34

PBs by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) (2,4). One such group bear destabilizing AU-rich elements

35

(AREs) in their 3’-untranslated regions (3’-UTRs) and encode potent regulatory molecules like

36

growth factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and angiogenic factors, making their turnover

37

and/or suppression in PBs fundamental to our physiology (9-11). We and others showed that the

38

presence of visible PBs correlates with increased turnover/suppression of ARE-mRNAs (11-15).

39

Conversely, when PBs are lost, constitutive ARE-mRNA suppression is reversed. This provides

40

cells with a means to rapidly respond to stimuli that disassemble PBs to produce

41

proinflammatory cytokines, making PB disassembly an important yet underappreciated

42

regulatory mechanism that tunes the production of potent proinflammatory cytokines that contain

43

AREs, molecules like IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and TNF (9).

44
45

PBs are constitutive, dynamic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules that change in size and number

46

in response to different stimuli. We and others have shown that stressors that activate the

47

p38/MK2 MAP kinase pathway, as well as many virus infections elicit PB disassembly

48

(12,13,15-18). Disassembly can occur by a direct interaction between a viral protein(s) and a PB

49

component that is subsequently re-localized to viral replication and transcription compartments

50

(vRTCs) (19-21) or cleaved by viral proteases (21-23). Viruses can also cause PB disassembly

51

indirectly by activating p38/MK2 signaling (12,13). Despite numerous reports of viral gene

52

products that trigger PB disassembly, corresponding reports of viral gene products that stimulate

53

PB formation are rare, which suggests that PBs possess direct antiviral function and their

54

disassembly may favour viral replication in ways that we fail to grasp (24). Even though other

55

RNPs such as stress granules have emerged as important components of our antiviral defenses

56

that contribute to sensing virus and triggering innate immune responses (25-27), the evidence to

57

support a direct antiviral role for PBs is less well established (24). A direct-acting antiviral role

58

has been defined for several PB-localized enzymes that impede viral replication (e.g.

59

APOBEC3G, MOV10). However, in these cases, the mechanism of viral restriction was

60

attributed to the enzymatic activity of the PB protein(s) and its localization to PBs was not

61

deemed as significant (20,21,23,28-35). PBs also harbour antiviral proteins that are important for

62

innate immune signaling, diverting them and keeping them ready for the inducement of the

63

desired antiviral response (20,36). It remains unclear if organization of particular proteins in PBs,

64

or the higher order condensation of many proteins into the PB, regulates its antiviral activities.

65

Nonetheless, the disassembly of PBs by diverse viruses strongly suggests their importance.

66
67

The family Coronaviridae includes seven viruses that infect humans, including the four

68

circulating ‘common cold’ coronaviruses (CoVs), HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and

69

HCoV-HKU1 and three zoonotic viruses that cause severe disease in humans: MERS-CoV,

70

SARS-CoV, and the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 (37,38). The latter is the infectious cause of

71

coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). When severe, COVID is characterized by aberrant

72

proinflammatory cytokine production, endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction and multiple organ

73

involvement and has resulted in more than a million deaths worldwide thus far (39-44). Despite

74

previous CoV epidemics, we do not yet appreciate precisely how SARS-CoV-2 infection causes

75

the pathology observed in COVID and urgently need to define these molecular mechanisms to

76

inform novel therapeutic strategies. Although all CoVs encode multiple proteins that hijack

77

antiviral and interferon (IFN) responses (45), SARS-CoV-2 excels in this regard and a

78

mismanaged IFN response is emerging as a major clinical determinant of COVID outcomes (45-

79

48). In support of this, new evidence continues to reveal the multitude of mechanisms used by

80

SARS-CoV-2 to out compete antiviral responses (49-53). For example, four SARS-CoV-2 non-

81

structural proteins (nsp) were recently reported to each interact with specific cellular RNA

82

targets to dramatically diminish IFN-β production and promote viral propagation (52).

83
84

To contribute to an enhanced understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs usurp cellular

85

antiviral responses and alter cytokine mRNA expression profiles, we performed an analysis of

3

86

PBs. There is no published literature on human CoVs and PBs, and only two previous reports

87

mentioned PB dynamics after CoV infection. Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) was reported to

88

increase PBs at early infection times, while transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV)

89

infected cells displayed complete PB loss by 16 hours post infection (24,54-56). We now present

90

the first evidence to show that PBs are targeted for disassembly by a human CoV. We also show

91

that SARS-CoV-2 encodes multiple proteins that when expressed alone are capable of causing

92

PB loss, supporting a coordinated effort by CoVs to disassemble these granules. Finally, we

93

show that prior formation of PBs restricts infection with OC43, delaying the expression of the

94

viral nucleocapsid protein and preventing infectious progeny production. Taken together, these

95

results suggest PBs play central role in the cellular antiviral responses to CoV infection.

Results

100

A screen of SARS-CoV-2 genes reveals mediators of PB loss

101

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is predicted to contain up to 14 open reading frames (ORFs). The

102

two N-terminal ORFs (1a and 1ab) encode two large polyproteins which are processed by viral

103

proteases into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) essential for viral genome replication and

104

transcription (37). The 3’ end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is predicted to code for ORFs that are

105

expressed from 9 subgenomic mRNAs (57). Among these are the four structural proteins spike

106

(S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) and up to 9 potential accessory proteins,

107

not all of which have been validated in infected cells (37). To test the role of SARS-CoV-2 gene

108

products in PB disassembly, we obtained a plasmid library of 27 SARS-CoV-2 genes from the

109

Krogan lab; this library included 14 nsps (excluding nsp3 and nsp16), all structural (S, E, M, N)

110

and candidate accessory genes (ORFs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, 9c, 10) and a catalytically inactive

111

mutant version of the nsp5 3C-like protease (C145A) (57). We individually transfected each

112

plasmid into HeLa cells that express a Dox-inducible GFP-tagged version of the PB-resident

113

protein, Dcp1a (6). When fixed, these GFP-positive puncta co-stain with endogenous PB

114

proteins such as the RNA helicase DDX6/Rck (Fig 1A) and the decapping co-factor hedls/Edc4

115

(Fig S1). While control cells or those transfected with the envelope (E) protein displayed DDX6-

116

positive PBs, PBs were largely absent after transfection of six SARS-CoV-2 genes including the

117

viral nucleocapsid (N) and the accessory gene, ORF7b (Fig 1A). We quantified number of

118

DDX6-positive PBs per cell for each transfection using CellProfiler, as in (58). This

119

quantification was performed in two different ways. In most cases, transfected cells were

120

identified by co-staining for the Strep-tag II fused to each gene, as shown for N, E and ORF7b

121

(Fig 1A). In such cases, we were able to count PBs only in cells with positive staining only and

122

not count PBs in bystander cells (Fig 1B, thresholded). These data identified two SARS-CoV-2

123

proteins that may cause PB loss in a cell autonomous manner: ORF7b and N (Fig 1B). For the

124

remaining transfections (nsp1, nsp5, nsp6, nsp11, nsp13, nsp14, ORF3b, ORF6, ORF9b, ORF9c)

125

immunostaining for the Strep-tag II was not robust and we were unable to threshold our PB

126

counts using CellProfiler. In these samples, we quantified PBs in all cells (Fig 1B,

127

unthresholded). These data identified four additional SARS-CoV-2 proteins that may cause PB

128

loss: ORF3b, nsp1, nsp6 and nsp11 (Fig 1B). We verified the expression of all constructs,

129

including low expressors (nsp1, nsp5, nsp6, nsp11, nsp13, nsp14, ORF3b, ORF6, ORF9b and

130

ORF9c) by immunoblotting whole cell lysates harvested from parallel transfections (Fig 1C). We

131

were unable to detect nsp4 and ORF10 by immunoblotting; however, we did visualize these

132

proteins in immunostained samples. Consistent with previous work (57), we were unable to

133

detect nsp6 by immunoblotting or by immunostaining, despite our observation that these cells

134

appear to have less DDX6-positive puncta than our controls (Fig 1B, C).

135
136

A screen of SARS-CoV-2 genes reveals enhancers of an ARE-containing luciferase reporter

137

We performed a secondary reporter screen to identify SARS-CoV-2 proteins that enhanced the

138

activity of a firefly luciferase (FLuc) reporter containing an ARE sequence in its 3’ UTR,

139

rendering the mRNA sensitive to constitutive turnover or translational suppression in PBs (59).

140

For this reason, control samples display extremely low levels of FLuc luminescence relative to a

141

non-ARE renilla luciferase (RLuc) transfection control, that reflects the turnover or suppression

142

of the FLuc mRNA (Fig 2A). When reporter constructs are co-transfected with the positive

143

control protein, KapB, which we have previously shown to cause PB disassembly and elevate the

144

FLuc ARE-mRNA reporter (13,59), the relative luminescence is enhanced ~50-fold (Fig 2B).

145

After co-transfection with the SARS-CoV-2 gene library, we identified three SARS-CoV-2

146

proteins that significantly elevated relative luminescence as well as or better than KapB: nsp1

147

(150-fold), nsp14 (80-fold), and ORF7b (40-fold), and two others that elevated luminescence 10-

148

20-fold: nsp13 and ORF6 (Fig 2B). Of these ARE-mRNA regulating SARS-CoV-2 gene

149

products, two overlap with those we showed to cause PB loss, nsp1 and ORF7b (Fig 1).

150
151

Validation of SARS-CoV-2 genes that cause PB loss in primary endothelial cells

152

Endothelial cells (ECs) have emerged as playing a significant role in severe COVID, they are

153

also sources for many of the cytokines elevated in severe disease and are infected by SARS-

154

CoV-2 (48,60-63). We validated top hits from our PB and ARE-containing reporter screen in

155

human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that were transduced with recombinant

156

lentiviruses expressing N, nsp14 or a vector control. Transduced cells were selected and stained

157

for the endogenous PB marker protein DDX6 and for the Strep-tag II on each of SARS-CoV-2

158

constructs. Compared to the control, we observed PB loss in N-expressing cells and a decrease in

159

PB numbers in the nsp14-transduced cell population (Fig 3). We also observed that in some

6

160

cells, nsp14 staining, although usually difficult to detect, overlapped with DDX6-positive puncta

161

in nsp14-transfected HeLa cells (Fig 3B, C). The significance of this observation is unclear and

162

we are investigating it further.

163
164

Infection of endothelial cells with human coronavirus causes PB loss

165

To understand if PBs were lost during infection with human coronaviruses, we established an

166

infection model for the human CoV, OC43, in HUVECs. We tested the ability of OC43 to enter

167

and replicate in these primary cells and confirmed that HUVECs are permissive to OC43 (Fig

168

4A). We then performed a time-course experiment wherein OC43-infected HUVECs were fixed

169

at various times post infection and stained for DDX6 (PBs) and the viral nucleocapsid (N)

170

protein to denote infected cells. We observed that PBs were lost after infection with OC43 but

171

not lost over the time course of the experiment in our mock-infected control cells (Fig 4A-B).

172

These results showed that PB counts were significantly diminished at 12 and 24 hpi (Fig 4A-B).

173

To determine if the reduced PB counts correlated with changes to cytokine mRNA levels, we

174

harvested total RNA from OC43-infected cells at 24 hpi and performed RT-qPCR for two ARE-

175

containing cytokine transcripts, IL-6 and IL-8 (Fig 4C). Consistent with the observed reduction

176

in PBs, the steady-state levels of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA both increased ~20-fold compared to

177

uninfected cells (Fig 4C). We also observed, in some infected cells, DDX6-positive puncta

178

reappeared at 24 hpi, but these puncta did not resemble PBs in terms of their size or shape but

179

were larger, non-spherical aggregates. It is unclear at this time if these DDX6-positive

180

aggregates represent vRTCs or stress granules, another RNP granule that viruses manipulate

181

(25,26). Further experiments will determine the nature of these aggregates.

182
183

PBs restrict coronavirus infection

184

Since SARS-CoV-2 encodes six proteins that induce PB loss and infection with OC43

185

recapitulates this loss, we hypothesized that PBs may be able to restrict coronavirus infection. To

186

test this, we used lentiviruses to deliver the fluorescently-labeled PB protein, GFP-Dcp1a, or a

187

control GFP protein to HUVECs prior to infecting with OC43. At various times post infection,

188

cells were fixed and stained for the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein (Fig 5A). Although OC43 was

189

able to express N in GFP-positive control cells, we observed viral N gene expression was

190

restricted in cells that expressed GFP-Dcp1a (Fig 5A). The restriction was most pronounced at

7

191

6hpi, when we observed only ~20% of GFP-Dcp1a-positive cells were visibly infected,

192

compared to the GFP-only controls (Fig 5B). At later infection times, more N gene expression

193

was observed in cells also expressing GFP-Dcp1a, suggesting that OC43 infection was able to

194

overcome the restriction imposed by GFP-Dcp1a (Fig 5B). Next, we examined if an increased

195

dose of the GFP-Dcp1a lentivirus, that should elicit the formation of more PBs, would increase

196

the restrictive phenotype (Fig 5C). HUVECs were transduced with 5-fold more GFP-Dcp1a

197

lentivirus than in Fig 5B, infected with OC43, and the infected cell supernatant was collected at

198

24hpi (Fig 5C). The amount of OC43 infectious particles produced in each condition was

199

determined using a TCID50 assay (64). Infectious OC43 particles were produced from control

200

cell populations transduced with the GFP virus and there was no significant difference in viral

201

particles produced after transduction with a lower dose of GFP-Dcp1a lentivirus (Fig 5C).

202

However, the addition of 5-fold more GFP-Dcp1a lentivirus prior to OC43 infection restricted

203

viral replication and no infectious OC43 particles were detected in the 24hpi-supernatant taken

204

from these cells (Fig 5C). Taken together, these data show that PB fortification prior to OC43

205

virus infection restricts virus replication, providing a compelling reason why SARS-CoV-2

206

would coordinate an attack on cellular PBs using multiple viral proteins.

Discussion

210

In this manuscript, we present data to show that the human CoV, OC43, causes PB loss during

211

infection. The loss of PBs correlates with elevated steady-state levels of two PB-regulated

212

cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8. Using a gene library, we also identify six candidate gene products

213

encoded by SARS-CoV-2 that are capable of inducing PB loss and three candidate gene products

214

that stabilize an ARE-containing luciferase reporter. Moreover, we present evidence that prior

215

fortification of PB granules using overexpression of the PB protein, GFP-Dcp1a, restricts the

216

infectious cycle of OC43, delaying viral nucleocapsid protein production and preventing

217

infectious progeny production. These data support our model that PBs are antiviral granules

218

designed to protect cells from viral invaders.

219
220

Multiple SARS-CoV-2 gene products highlight the diversity of approaches used by one virus to

221

induce PB loss

222

We screened 27 SARS-CoV-2 gene products by transfection in HeLa cells (57) and identified six

223

candidates that reduce PB numbers including the viral nucleocapsid protein (N), the viral host

224

shutoff factor (nsp1), non-structural proteins nsp6 and nsp11, and accessory proteins ORF7b and

225

ORF3b (Fig 1). The most significant of these candidates was the N protein, which we also

226

showed caused endogenous PB loss in primary ECs (Fig 3). N is a multifunctional RNA-binding

227

protein (RBP) that coats the viral genome and induces phase separation to promote viral particle

228

assembly (37,65-68). N possesses several non-specific RNA-binding regions and is

229

phosphorylated in its central serine-arginine (SR-rich) domain (68,69). SARS-CoV-2 N also

230

contains three putative NLS sequences (70). One possible reason for PB loss may be the

231

indiscriminate RNA binding of N protein which acts as sponge for RNA, pulling it out of

232

cytoplasm, reducing the RNA-protein interactions required for phase separation of PBs (3). We

233

are currently engaged in site-directed and truncation mutagenesis studies to determine the precise

234

region(s) of N that are essential for its effect on PBs (71). Another PB-regulating SARS-CoV-2

235

protein we discovered is the bifunctional enzyme, nsp14, which possesses an N-terminal

236

exonuclease domain (ExoN) required for proofreading of the CoV polymerase complex and a C-

237

terminal N-methyltransferase (MTase) domain that contributes to viral RNA capping (37,72).

238

Nsp14 caused PB loss in our EC validation studies yet it did not cause PB loss in HeLa cells (Fig

239

1, 3). Though we are unclear of the precise reason for these discrepant results, one consideration

9

240

is that GFP-Dcp1a expression in HeLa cells makes PBs more stable and their disassembly more

241

difficult. It was also quite difficult to detect the expression of nsp14 in HeLa cells after their

242

transfection, although nsp14 was detected by immunoblotting; therefore, PBs were counted in all

243

cells, and the results were not specific for cells that expressed nsp14 (Fig 1). In contrast, in our

244

EC validation studies we selected for transduced cells; thus, all ECs contain nsp14 even if the

245

staining is low (Fig 3). This may explain the significant PB loss observed in ECs and not in

246

HeLa cells. Finally, we observed that nsp14 occasionally formed small puncta that overlapped

247

with DDX6-positive PBs in both HeLa cells and ECs (Fig 3A, 3C). There are no previous reports

248

of any other CoV proteins co-localizing to PBs. The significance of this observation remains

249

unclear. We will continue to interrogate nsp14 localization using confocal microscopy and

250

immunoprecipitation assays. Nsp14 was also a significant hit in the luciferase reporter assay (Fig

251

2), suggesting that nsp14 promotes the stabilization or translation of PB-localized, ARE-

252

containing cytokine mRNA. Consistent with this, alphacoronavirus nsp14 enhanced TNF and

253

IFN-b (both these mRNAs contain AREs) independent of its enzymatic functions, a phenotype

254

that is consistent with a PB-regulating protein (73).

255
256

Our initial validation efforts have focused on nsp14 and N (Fig 3); however, our screens did

257

highlight other SARS-CoV-2 proteins that may regulate PBs to enhance translation of ARE-

258

mRNAs. These include the top hit in our luciferase screen, nsp1. All CoVs encode a host shutoff

259

protein called nsp1 that is the first protein expressed after virus entry and an important IFN

260

antagonist that limits IFN and interferon-stimulated gene translation (52,74). SARS-CoV-2 nsp1

261

binds to 18S rRNA and the blocks the mRNA entry channel in the 40S ribosomal subunit,

262

thereby blocking translation (52,75). Given its role in translation shutoff and RNA decay, we

263

were initially concerned that nsp1-mediated elevation in the ARE-containing FLuc reporter was

264

non-specific because we observed low levels of the RLuc control that could suggest global

265

translation shutoff (52,76-78). However, stress-responsive cellular transcripts are often resistant

266

to the action of nsp1and other viral shutoff proteins suggesting that the sequestration of

267

regulatory transcripts in PBs is a strategy used by cells to withstand viral host shutoff (74,77,79).

268

For this reason, PB-regulated transcripts like the ARE-containing FLuc reporter may be resistant

269

to nsp1-mediated shutoff (Fig 2). We are currently validating if nsp1 is a PB-regulating viral

270

protein in ECs and will explore its effects on cytokine mRNA levels. In addition, ORF7b and the

271

short ORF3b are intriguing hits because both are accessory proteins that have been reported to

272

either activate the kinase p38 (an inducer of PB disassembly) or antagonize IFN responses

273

(53,80). Not picked up in our screen, the viral 3C-like protease, nsp5, is also of particular interest

274

because porcine CoV nsp5 cleaves Dcp1a, an event that would be predicted to cause PB

275

disassembly (81). Although nsp6 and nsp11 were top hits in our unthresholded PB screen (Fig

276

1), their expression is either toxic or difficult to detect and we are engaged in developing

277

strategies to minimize these issues and study them further.

278
279

PBs are antiviral granules that restrict CoV infection

280

We used the human CoV, OC43, to infect ECs and show that virus infection caused significant

281

PB loss at 12 and 24 hpi (Fig 4). We then fortified PBs using the overexpression of GFP-Dcp1a

282

and showed that PB fortification before infection delayed the visual expression of viral

283

nucleoprotein and restricted the production of infectious viral particles (Fig 5). However, the

284

precise details of the mechanism of restriction remain unclear. We are engaged in ongoing time

285

course experiments to determine if the restrictive phenotype represents a delay of viral progeny

286

production or a complete block. It is also unclear if the prior GFP-Dcp1a overexpression restricts

287

OC43 replication due to a direct antiviral role of the Dcp1a enzyme itself or its ability to promote

288

the formation of larger PBs (82,83). GFP-Dcp1a overexpression is a common approach used to

289

visualize PBs, and we know these GFP-positive puncta co-stain with endogenous PB proteins

290

(Fig 1) (82). However, GFP-Dcp1a puncta are larger and may be more stable than endogenous

291

PBs (56,83). Our ongoing work will utilize other molecular tools that regulate PB dynamics to

292

determine if certain PB resident proteins exert antiviral properties independent from the

293

formation of the PB granule itself. We are currently engaged in experiments to overexpress

294

different PB proteins that have roles in RNA decay (Dcp1a, DDX6 RNA helicase, the decapping

295

cofactor hedls/Edc4 or the exonuclease Xrn1) as well as PB proteins that do not directly mediate

296

RNA decay but play an important condensation role for PB granule formation (Lsm14A, 4E-T)

297

(3,4,84). Each of the proposed proteins will affect PBs differently when overexpressed: Dcp1a,

298

hedls/Edc4 and DDX6 increase PB formation, with Dcp1a expression inducing larger granules

299

than the others, Dcp2 has no effect on granule size/number, and Xrn-1 eliminates PBs because it

300

increases mRNA decay (4,83-86). We predict that other GFP-tagged PB proteins that promote

301

molecular condensation of PBs, such as GFP-DDX6, will also restrict OC43 infection.

302

Conversely, we expect that the overexpression of Xrn1 will promote viral infection (as shown by

303

others (34)) because it prevents PB formation, even though it can degrade viral RNA.

304
305

There is increasing evidence in support of our hypothesis that the antiviral role of PB-localized

306

enzymes is promoted by phase separation of molecules into PBs and that the antiviral function of

307

these molecules is lost when PB granules decondense. This has been previously proposed for

308

decapping complexes, the enzymatic activity of which is increased by phase separation and

309

decreased in solution (3-5). However, for PB-localized enzymes that have established antiviral

310

effects, (e.g. APOBEC, MOV10), their ability to restrict virus infection has previously been

311

attributed to their enzymatic activity rather than their localization to PBs (20,21,23,29-35,82).

312

Therefore, it is not yet clear if the antiviral capability of PBs relies on their formation into

313

biomolecular condensates. Here, we consider that the antiviral restriction promoted by PB-

314

localized enzymes requires the granule formation for optimal function. By that definition, factors

315

that promote PB condensation may also be antiviral. Therefore, in part one of our model, we

316

propose that PBs are direct-acting antiviral granules that can restrict virus infection when present

317

as visible condensates; for this reason, they are targeted by disassembly by most viruses.

318
319

PBs interact with other innate immune pathways to regulate antiviral signaling

320

One possibility is that PBs are antiviral because their proteins help the cell respond to signals that

321

activate innate immune pathways (20,22,36,85). It is not clear if PB antiviral activities are

322

connected to established regulators of innate immune signaling such as the RNA sensors RIG-

323

I/MDA5, transcription factors IRF3/NF-kB, or the production of Type I IFNs, though reports

324

suggest this may indeed be the case (36,85,87). The recent demonstration that TRAF6 controls

325

Dcp1a localization within PBs using ubiquitylation suggests that antiviral signaling is more

326

complex than previously appreciated and integrates transcriptional responses with cytokine

327

mRNA suppression in PBs (85,87). Moreover, the PB protein Lsm14A has also been shown to

328

bind to viral RNA/DNA after infection to promote IRF3 activation and IFN-b production (36).

329

Although it remains unclear if organization of particular proteins in PBs, or the higher order

330

condensation of many proteins into the PB, regulates its antiviral activity (82,87), what is clear is

331

that PB disassembly reverses the constitutive decay or translational suppression of cytokine

332

mRNAs that contain AREs that would normally occur there (11-15,88). These data suggest that

12

333

when viruses coordinate an attack to cause PB loss, this event relieves the cytokine mRNA

334

suppression and acts as a danger signal that signals the immune system for help. In this way, PB

335

disassembly may be a central component of the cellular innate immune response and part of the

336

sequelae of signals that notify the immune system that a cell is infected. In situations where

337

interferon responses are delayed or defective, as is emerging for SARS-CoV-2 and severe

338

COVID (45-53), PB disassembly may be an important contributing factor to pathogenic cytokine

339

responses. Therefore, in part two of our model, we propose that cells view viral PB disassembly

340

as a danger signal and respond by increasing production of proinflammatory cytokines as a call

341

for reinforcements.

342
343

A new model for the role of PBs as a nexus of intracellular antiviral responses

344

We now propose a model for how PBs may regulate cellular innate responses to CoV infection

345

(Fig 6). Our model places PBs at a nexus point, a connection between intracellular direct-acting

346

antiviral responses and proinflammatory cytokine responses. We propose that PBs function as

347

direct-acting antiviral granules that can restrict virus infection if robustly induced into phase-

348

separated molecular condensates; for this reason, they are targeted by disassembly by most

349

viruses. Second, when viral invaders cause PB loss, the cell responds to the inactivation of PBs

350

with a call for reinforcements. This occurs because PBs house suppressed cytokine transcripts

351

which are relieved of their suppression by viral PB disassembly. This model places the PB as a

352

central player in the antiviral response that coordinates the immune reshaping that occurs after

353

CoV infection.

369

coverslips.

370

Plasmids and Cloning

371

pLenti-IRES-Puro SARS-CoV2 plasmids were a generous gift from the Krogan Lab (89).

372

pLJM1-GFP-Dcp1a was generated by cloning pT7-EGFP-C1-HsDCP1a (Addgene 25030) into

373

pLJM1-BSD (90)using AgeI and SmaI restriction sites (NEB). pLJM1-KapB-BSD was

376

Transient Transfections

377

Transient transfections were performed using Fugene (Promega) according to manufacturer’s

378

guidelines. Briefly, HeLa Flp-In TREx GFP-Dcp1a cells were seeded in 12-well plates at

379

150,000 cells/well in antibiotic-free DMEM on coverslips for immunofluorescence or directly in

380

wells for lysates. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA and 3 μL of Fugene for 48 h before

381

processing.

All lentiviruses were generated using a second-generation system. Briefly, HEK293T cells were

384

transfected with pSPAX2, MD2G, and the plasmid containing a gene of interest using

385

polyethylimine (PEI, Polysciences). Viral supernatants were harvested 48 h post-transfection

386

and frozen at -80°C until use. For transduction, lentiviruses were thawed at 37°C and added to

387

target cells in complete media containing 5 µg/mL polybrene (Sigma) for 24 h. The media was

388

changed to selection media containing 1 µg/mL puromycin or 5 µg/mL blasticidin (Thermo

391

Cells were seeded onto coverslips for immunofluorescence experiments. Following treatment,

392

cells were fixed for 10 mins at 37 °C in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy

393

Sciences). Samples were permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10

394

min at room temperature and blocked in 1% human AB serum (Sigma-Aldrich) 1 h at room

395

temperature. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 1% human AB serum and used at

396

the concentrations in Table 1. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Samples were mounted with

397

Prolong Gold AntiFade mounting media (Thermo).

398

Immunoblotting

399

Cells were lysed in 2X Laemmli buffer and stored at -20°C until use. The DC Protein Assay

400

(Bio-Rad) was used to quantify protein concentration as per the manufacturer’s instructions. 10-

401

15 µg of protein lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4-15% gradient TGX Stain-Free

402

acrylamide gels (BioRad). Total protein images were acquired from the PVDF membranes after

403

transfer on the ChemiDoc Touch Imaging system (BioRad). Membranes were blocked in 5%

404

BSA in TBS-T. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 2.5% BSA, and used at the

405

dilutions found in Table 1. Membranes were visualized using Clarity Western ECL substrate and

406

the ChemiDoc Touch Imaging system (BioRad).

407

Luciferase Assays

408

HeLa Tet-Off cells were transfected according to Corcoran J.A. et al. Methods (2011) with

409

pTRE2-Firefly Luciferase-ARE, pTRE2-Renilla Luciferase, and SARS-CoV2 plasmids using

410

Fugene HD (Promega). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activity were quantified using the Dual

411

Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega) and read on a Modulus Microplate luminometer (Promega).

412

Quantitative PCR

413

RNA was collected using an RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s

414

instructions and stored at -80°C until use. RNA concentration was determined and was reverse

415

transcribed using qScript XLT cDNA SuperMix (QuantaBio) using a combination of random

416

hexamer and oligo dT primers, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Depending on

417

starting concentration, cDNA was diluted between 1:10 and 1:20 for qPCR experiments and

418

SsoFast EvaGreen Mastermix (Biorad) was used to amplify cDNA. The ∆∆quantitation cycle

422

Stocks of hCoV-OC43 (ATCC) were propagated in Vero E6 cells. To produce viral stocks, Vero

423

E6 cells were infected at an MOI of 0.01 for 1 h in serum-free DMEM at 33˚C. Following

424

infection, the viral inoculum was removed and replaced with DMEM supplemented with 2%

425

heat-inactivated FBS and 100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine. After 6 days, the

426

supernatant was harvested and centrifuged at 2000 RPM for 5 mins to remove cellular debris.

427

Virus stocks were aliquoted and stored at -80˚C for single use. Viral titers were enumerated

428

using Reed and Muench tissue-culture infectious dose 50% (TCID50) in Vero E6 cells (64). For

429

infection, cells were seeded onto coverslips to achieve ~70% confluency after 24 hours. The

430

following day, the growth media was removed and replaced with 100 µl of human CoV-OC43

431

inoculum and incubated at 37˚C for one hour, rocking the plate every 10 minutes to distribute

432

viral inoculum. Following incubation, the virus inoculum was removed and replaced with EGM-

435

Processing Body Quantification

436

Processing bodies were quantified using an unbiased image analysis pipeline generated in the

437

freeware CellProfiler (cellprofiler.org) (91). First, detection of nuclei in the DAPI channel image

438

was performed by applying a binary threshold and executing primary object detection between

439

50 and 250 pixels. From each identified nuclear object, the “Propagation” function was

440

performed on the respective CoV2-ORF channel image to define cell borders. The identified cell

441

borders were masked with the identified nuclei to define a cytoplasm mask. The cytoplasm mask

442

was then applied to the processing body puncta channel image to ensure only cytoplasmic puncta

443

were quantified. Background staining was reduced in the cytoplasmic puncta channel using the

444

“Enhance Speckles” function. Using “global thresholding with robust background adjustments”,

445

puncta within a defined size and intensity range were quantified. Size and intensity thresholds

446

were unchanged between experiments with identical staining parameters. Intensity measurements

447

of puncta and CoV2-ORF staining were quantified. Quantification data was exported and

448

RStudio was used for data analysis.

Statistics

451

All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0. Significance was determined
