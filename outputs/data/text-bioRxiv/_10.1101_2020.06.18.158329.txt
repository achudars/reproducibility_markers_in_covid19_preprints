Abstract
The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has triggered multiple efforts for serological tests
and vaccine development. Most of these tests and vaccines are based on the Spike
glycoprotein (S) or the Nucleocapsid (N) viral protein. Conservation of these antigens
among viral strains is critical to ensure optimum diagnostic test performance and broad
protective efficacy, respectively. We assessed N and S antigen diversity from 17,853
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and evaluated selection pressure. Up to 6-7 incipient
phylogenetic clades were identified for both antigens, confirming early variants of the S
antigen and identifying new ones. Significant diversifying selection was detected at
multiple sites for both antigens. Some sequence variants have already spread in multiple
regions, in spite of their low frequency. In conclusion, the N and S antigens of SARSCoV-2 are well conserved antigens, but new clades are emerging and may need to be
included in future diagnostic and vaccine formulations.

Introduction
The emergence and rapid spread of a novel Coronavirus, referred to as SARSCoV-2, is resulting in one of the worst pandemic in the world, causing an unprecedented
health and economic crisis. About seven months after the first cases were identified, over
8 million cases have been reported worldwide, with over 400,000 deaths according to the
Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.
The pandemic has triggered multiple efforts at developing serological tests, able
to detect both acute infections by detecting virus-specific IgM, as well as recovered
individuals by detecting virus-specific IgG. Several immunochromatographic rapid tests
are already available (1), and several more will become available in the next few months.
Such tools would be critical to increase testing for the accurate and rapid identification of
cases and their isolation to limit further transmission of the virus. However, their
performance needs to be evaluated, and initial testing suggested variable performance of
these tests (1, 2). Test performance relies in part on the antigen used, and its conservation
among virus strains circulating in the population being tested. Currently, most of these
tests are based on the Spike glycoprotein (S) or the Nucleocapsid (N) viral proteins (1).
The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein, which mediates binding to the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in human cells (3), is also widely used
as a diagnostic antigen.
Similarly, vaccine development efforts have been very intense and a growing
number of vaccine candidates are being quickly moved into clinical trials. These are
based on different technological platforms, ranging from recombinant proteins, RNA and
DNA vaccines, or recombinant viral vectors (4, 5). A first RNA vaccine candidate

recently completed clinical phase 1 evaluation, and is expected to move into Phase 2
shortly. Most of these vaccine candidates are based on the viral S protein, or the RBD as
antigen. Multiple potential vaccine epitopes have also been identified in the S as well as
in the N viral proteins (6). As for diagnostics, conservation of these vaccine antigens
among viral strains is critical to ensure broad protection and avoid immune evasion by
the virus.
As an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 is prone to frequent mutations, in spite of some
proof-reading abilities of its RNA polymerase complex (7, 8). An early assessment of
genomic changes SARS-CoV-2 showed a mutation hot-spot in the virus RNA dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRp), but a few mutations were also detected in other parts of the
viral genome, including the N and S proteins (9). The growing availability of a large
number of complete genome sequences gathered since the beginning of the pandemic
provides a unique tool to assess the extent of viral antigen polymorphisms, and potential
selection pressures on these. A first analysis of polymorphisms in the S glycoprotein until
early April 2020 identified a handful of variant sites, including D614G, S943P, and
possibly L5F and L8V (10). Variant sites V367F, G476S, and V483A were also
identified in the RBD. We analyzed here the sequence variation in a broader set of viral
proteins N and S, which represent the main diagnostic and vaccine antigens to date. We
examined the implications of the identified sequence variants on vaccine and serological
diagnostic performance.

Whole genome sequences from 18,247 SARS-CoV-2 virus were obtained from
GISAID (Supplemental Table 1), covering virus isolates from multiple continents,
including Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, and America. These sequences included those
from initial human cases in Wuhan, China from December 2019 up to sequences from
May 11, 2020.

Sequence analysis
Viral genome sequences were aligned using MAFFT (11) as implemented in
Geneious 11, and alignments were edited to exclude partial or low quality sequences. A
final alignment including 17,853 quality sequences were used to construct phylogenetic
trees using FastTree (12) for a global analysis of viral diversity across the world.
FastTree infers approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees. Sequence
conservation across genome alignment was calculated using s sliding window of one in
Geneious.
Separate analyses were then performed using S and N genes, as well as the RBD
from the S protein (positions 319-540 within the S protein). For these, translated
sequences were aligned with the MAFFT algorithm using Blossum62 matrix and the
frequency of variants at each site was calculated. Unique sequences from these proteins
were then selected and phylogenetic trees were constructed using FastTree as above.
Predicted epitopes from these antigens (6, 13) were mapped in the alignments, as well as
glycosylation sites (14) to assess their conservation among viral sequences. Finally,
evolutionary selection pressures on the antigens were analyzed using the Fast,

Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR), as implemented in HyPhy (15) and
statistical significance was considered at a threshold of P<0.1.

Results
Analysis of over 17,000 genome sequences confirmed the SARS-CoV-2 is a fast
evolving virus, as it is rapidly accumulating mutations. Indeed, in the less than 5 months
that viral sequences have been available, we detected sequence variants scattered
throughout the viral genome, rather than clustered in specific genes (Figure 1A and B)
and some virus circulating now in multiple countries has somewhat diverged from some
of the isolates initially sequenced in December 2019 in Wuhan, China (Figure 1C).
Importantly, some sequence variation could be detected within both the N and S genes.
These genes were then analyzed in detail and separately. For the N protein, we
included a dataset of 16,656 sequences, and significant sequence diversity was detected,
with up to 326 distinct protein sequences. For a clearer assessment of their phylogenetic
relationship, these variant sequences were analyzed independently (Figure 2A). Notably,
a structuring including up to seven incipient clades was found emerging, with sequences
from the first virus from Wuhan, China included in Clade 1 (Figure 2C). There was no
specific geographic clustering of the sequence variants, illustrating the widespread
multidirectional spreading of the virus across the world. A notable exception was
observed for Clade 3, which included mostly sequences from Europe. Analysis of
sequence variation along the protein sequence indicated that about half of the protein on
the amino side was mostly conserved, except in two regions at sites 13 and 203-204,

respectively (Figure 2B). On the other hand, the carboxy half of the protein appeared
more variable, but this also reflected some sequencing ambiguities.
A total of 178/419 (42.5%) sites presented variation in the N protein. This
included seven sites with four variant amino acids, seven sites with three variant amino
acids, and 13 sites with two variant amino acids that were found under significant
diversifying selection pressure (26/419 (6.2%), Table 1). Because of these changes, the N
protein is slowly diverging from the sequence from some of the early virus, belonging to
Clade 1, and up to six additional major clades (Clades 2-7) are emerging for the N
antigen (Figure 2C). Site D144 that can be substituted by E, H, Y or N may disrupt a
predicted epitope (ALNTPKDHI 138-146). Importantly, most variants were still found at
relatively low frequency among the viral population (0.018 to 0.541%), with only R203X
and P13X variants detected at higher frequency (18.108 and 1.589%, respectively, Table
1), indicating an overall high level of conservation of the N protein. Nonetheless, many
of the low frequency variants were found to have already dispersed in multiple countries
and regions. This is for example the case of S202X variants, which were detected in 90
cases from Australia, China, Democratic Republic Congo, England, Ghana, India, The
Netherland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Turkey, and the USA, or D22X, detected in
53 cases from Australia, England, Taiwan, Uruguay and Wales. On the other hand, a few
variants were likely more associated with limited clusters of infection, such as A208G
variants, which were mostly limited to the US so far.
A similar analysis of the S antigen was performed, based on 17,802 sequences. It
revealed even greater sequence diversity, with up to 681 unique S protein variants, and
most of this diversity was observed in the most recent months of March and April 2020

compared to January and February 2020 (Figure 3A). Furthermore, up to six emerging
clades could be defined, that present a clear divergence from Clade 1, which includes
some of the first sequences from Wuhan, China (Figure 3B). While some sequences from
Clades 3 and 6 could be detected as early as February 2020, sequences from Clades 2, 4
and 5 appeared in March 2020 and expanded in April 2020. At the same time, sequences
from Clade 1 appeared less frequent with time.
Analysis of sequence variation along the protein sequence indicated that amino
acid variants were spread along most of the S glycoprotein (Figure 3C), although a few
regions of lower sequence conservation could be detected at positions 260-320 just before
the RBD, at position 445-515 in the carboxy end of the RBD, and at site 614. Further
analysis of each major clade revealed that each had amino acid substitutions that
concentrated in different domains of the proteins, except for Clade 1, which accumulated
the greatest number of substitutions across the entire protein (Figure 4). For example,
Clade 2 had more substitutions between sites 850-970, Clade 3 between 550-750 and
1150-1250, Clade 4 between 250-320, Clade 5 between 140-250 and 420-500, and Clade
6 between 750-800.
A total of 362/1273 (28.4%) sites presented variation in the S protein, of which 32
sites (2.5%) were found under significant diversifying selection pressure (Table 2). These
included one site with five variant amino acids, one site with four variants, seven sites
with three variants, 11 sites with two variants, and 12 sites with a single variant amino
acid. Further more, different selection patterns were identified in each major clade, and
only a few notable sites had substitutions in more that one clade (Table 2 and Figure 4).
For example sequences from Clade 1 are clearly defined by site D614, which is under

strong diversifying selection, together with sites V615, G476, V483 and H519 and their
corresponding variants. Most sequences from Clades 2-6 have a D614G substitution,
together with clade specific variants. Thus, Clade 2 is characterized by a cluster of
substitutions around sites 936-943, with specific sites D936, S940 and S943 and their
variants under strong diversifying selection. Clade 3 is characterized by variants sites
V622, A653, A684, A703 and their variants, and Clade 5 by sites D215, S221 and Q238
and their variants (Table 2 and Figure 4). A single predicted epitope may be affected by
diversifying selection and substitutions at site 1078. The furin cleaveage region (671692), and particularly the cleavage site were well conserved, although two sites, Q675
and A684 are under diversifying selection. Substitutions at these less conserved sites may
thus not affect furin cleavage, which is unique to SARS-Cov-2 (3). Similarly, none of the
sites with N-linked glycosylation (14) were found under diversifying selection, allowing
for the conservation of the glycosylation pattern of the S protein across its diversity.
With the exception of the D614G substitution which has taken over and is now
widespread in virus populations across the globe (over 63% of sequences carry this
substitution), the other variants under selection still represent a low proportion of viral
sequences, ranging from 0.017 to 0.586% (Table 3). A few of these variants likely
correspond to limited clusters of infections, as they come from a single geographic region
and are grouped in time. This is the case for the G1124V variant, which is limited to 50
cases from Victoria, Australia, between March 20-27, 2020. Similarly, the N439K variant
is limited to 40 cases from Scotland, identified between March 16-April 5, 2020.
However, most of the other variants have already spread to multiple countries and
regions, such as Q675X, which has been found in Denmark, England, Finland, Iceland,

Norway, Scotland, Spain, and the USA over March and April 2020. Similarly, L5F
variants have been found on 102 cases from Australia, Belgium, Canada, England,
France, Iceland, India, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Portugal, Scotland, Singapore, Taiwan,
Thailand, USA, and Wales and H49X variants have been found in 36 cases from
Australia, China, England, Mexico, Taiwan, and the USA, for example.
As mentioned above, some of the sequence variation affecting the S protein was
detected within the RBD, which is a key functional domain of the protein and one of the
most used targets for serological diagnostic. We thus analyzed in detail its polymorphism.
Sequence analysis of RBD revealed that it represented a highly conserved region of the S
protein. Nonetheless, up to 54 RBD sequence variants were identified, with again some
significant divergence from the first sequences from Wuhan, China (Figure 5).
Importantly, divergence seemed to increase with time as more variants accumulate and
become established. A total of seven sites from the RBD were found under significant
diversifying selection pressure, and variants sites within the RBD were observed in each
of the major clades of the S protein (Table 2). Nonetheless, while possible RBD clades
are emerging, these do not match the S protein major clades described above.

Discussion
Antigen polymorphism from pathogens has the potential to impair serological
diagnostic test performance, as well as vaccine efficacy. It is thus of key importance to
consider these aspects for serological test and vaccine development, to ensure their
usefulness and broad efficacy. This is commonly done for influenza vaccines for
example, that are updated each year based on circulating viral strains, as cross protection

among strains is still elusive (16). We investigated here the sequence diversity of two
major antigens of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, the N and S proteins. Importantly, a
significant level of sequence diversity was detected for both antigens, with incipient
clades emerging as multiple sites were found under significant diversifying selection
pressure.
The N protein, mostly used in serological diagnostic tests (1) had a large number
of sequence variants, and 6.2% of its residues were found under diversifying selection.
Overall up to seven major sequence clades have been emerging in recent months for this
antigen, and these did not show any geographic clustering. A notable exception was
Clade 3 of the N protein, which appeared over-represented in sequences from Europe so
far. Importantly, predicted epitopes appeared conserved so far, although a more detail
epitope mapping is still needed for this antigen. Nonetheless, N protein variants diverging
from the initial sequences from Wuhan, China are now circulating in most geographic
regions. While these changes are so far limited to a relatively small proportion of
sequences (23.4%) and may not interfere with protein antigenicity, the inclusion of some
of the variants in serological tests would ensure optimum sensitivity of tests, particularly
if some of these variants become more frequent.
The S glycoprotein is the main vaccine candidate currently tested in multiple
vaccine platforms/formulation (4, 5). Compared to the N antigen, it is more conserved
and only 2.5% of its sites were found under diversifying selection pressure. We
confirmed the importance of most of the variant sites previously identified in this antigen.
These include D614G, S943P, as well as L5F and L8V and variant sites V367F, G476S,
and V483A in the RBD (10). However, multiple additional variants were also identified

here, leading to the identification of up to six major clades of the S glycoprotein that are
emerging. Most of these variants appeared in the past weeks/months and may be slowly
replacing the virus presenting sequences similar to that of the initial isolates from Wuhan,
China. Indeed, while most of the variants still have a low frequency in the viral
population, several have already spread to multiple countries and regions, where they
may reach higher frequencies in the near future if they are successfully transmitted.
Importantly, none of the substitutions identified affected the glycosylation pattern of the
S protein, and none of the predicted epitopes appear affected. While the functional impact
of these variants is unknown, the D614G mutation has been associated with potential
increased viral transmission and/or fitness (10), which may explain why it became so
frequent. A recent comparison of functional properties of the S proteins with aspartic acid
(SD614) and glycine (SG614) confirmed a greater infectivity correlated with less S1
shedding and greater incorporation of the S protein into the pseudovirion with the SG614
variant (17). Similar functional studies of the additional variants identified here may help
evaluate their impact on virus fitness. Future studies will also provide data on how the
different clades identified here may be successfully transmitted or go extinct.
While the RBD is particularly well conserved, some sequence variation was also
detected in this region within the S glycoprotein, with up to 54 sequence variants.
Because these differ by only 1-2 amino acids, the overall antibody recognition of the
RBD can be expected to be mostly preserved so far, but some specific epitopes may
nonetheless be lost. Also, our phylogenetic analysis suggested that possible clades may
be emerging within the RBD as well, and newer sequences may diverge further from the
sequence from the initial isolates from Wuhan.

In conclusion, we found that the N and S antigens of SARS-CoV-2 are so far
highly conserved, so that both are good antigens for both diagnostic and vaccine
development. However, some sequence variation is also emerging and 6-7 phylogenetic
clades could be identified for both antigens. Some of these sequence variants have
already spread in multiple countries and regions, in spite of their low frequency.
Sequence variants may arise by random substitutions in the viral genome during
replication, but the significant diversifying selection detected at multiple sites in both
antigens suggests that immune selection pressure and adaptation to human hosts may be
driving some of these changes, which may lead to the establishment of some of these
variants. New variants are also likely to emerge with time. The recent identification of
potential co-infections with more than one viral strain suggests that recombination could
also contribute to the generation of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity (18). Therefore,
further monitoring of antigen drift over time will be needed to ensure that diverging
antigens can be identified in a timely manner and included in future diagnostic and
vaccine formulations.
