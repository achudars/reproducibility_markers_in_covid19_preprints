Summary

2

Virus‐specific humoral and cellular immunity act synergistically to protect the host from viral

3

infection. We interrogated the dynamic changes of virological and immunological

4

parameters in 12 patients with symptomatic acute SARS‐CoV‐2 infection from disease onset

5

to convalescence or death. We quantified SARS‐CoV‐2 viral RNA in the respiratory tract in

6

parallel with antibodies and circulating T cells specific for various structural (NP, M, ORF3a

7

and spike) and non‐structural proteins (ORF7/8, NSP7 and NSP13). We observed that while

8

rapid induction and quantity of humoral responses were associated with increased disease

9

severity, an early induction of SARS‐CoV‐2 specific T cells was present in patients with mild

10

disease and accelerated viral clearance. These findings provide further support for a

11

protective role of SARS‐CoV‐2 specific T cells over antibodies during SARS‐CoV‐2 infection

12

with important implications in vaccine design and immune‐monitoring.

Introduction

2

In December 2019, a new coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, China in several patients

3

with pneumonia and was later named SARS‐CoV‐2(Zhou et al., 2020). The illness (COVID‐19)

4

resulting from SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is reported to be multi‐faceted with inflammation of

5

the respiratory tract causing the leading symptoms of fever and dry cough {Chen:2020kl}.

6

Both humoral (Long et al., 2020a) (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020) and cellular

7

(Grifoni et al., 2020) (Braun et al., 2020; Le Bert et al., 2020) (Weiskopf et al., 2020)

8

components of adaptive immunity are induced in SARS‐CoV‐2 infected individuals but their

9

roles in viral control or disease pathogenesis still needs to be clarified. Viral clearance and

10

reduced disease severity have been associated with a coordinated activation of humoral and

11

cellular anti‐viral immunity (Rydyznski Moderbacher et al., 2020) and robust T cell responses

12

(Takahashi et al., 2020). On the other hand, a positive relation between the magnitude of

13

SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies (Hung et al., 2020; Long et al., 2020b) or T cells(Peng et al., 2020)

14

with disease severity have also been reported. However, most of these studies have

15

analysed patients during the convalescent phase of infection and only a single study

16

reported the dynamic changes of viral and immunological parameters in severe COVID‐19

17

patients during the initial phases of infection (Weiskopf et al., 2020). To fill this gap, we

18

longitudinally followed‐up twelve patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection from symptom onset

19

to convalescence or death. We quantified SARS‐CoV‐2 viral load in the upper respiratory

20

tract and virus‐specific antibodies and T cells at multiple time points. Our data reveal a

21

direct association between early induction of SARS‐CoV‐2 specific T cells and rapid control of

22

viral infection.

Results

2

Dynamics of SARS‐CoV‐2 replication

3

Relative quantities of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the respiratory tract and its persistence in each

4

individual patient was calculated by utilizing the number of RT‐PCR cycles as a proxy of viral

5

quantity (Figure 1). Duration of infection was defined from symptom onset till RT‐PCR

6

negativity (two negative SARS‐CoV‐2 RT‐PCR 24 hours apart). The patients displayed

7

different profiles of virus quantity and persistence: short duration of infection was detected

8

in four patients (P18, 04, 02 and 15) who became RT‐PCR negative within 15 days of

9

symptom onset. Five (P11, 16, 06, 09 and 03) were RT‐PCR negative at around day 17‐24,

10

while two (P10 and 12) became RT‐PCR negative almost 1 month after onset of symptoms.

11

One patient (P05) who succumbed to infection was persistently SARS‐CoV‐2 RT‐PCR positive

12

till day 31 post symptom onset when he demised. Peak viral quantities was also positively

13

correlated with the duration of infection (Figure 1 insert). In addition, while patients who

14

eliminated the virus within 15 days experienced mild respiratory symptoms (presence of

15

fever or respiratory symptoms but not requiring supplemental oxygen), patients with

16

moderate (requiring oxygen supplementation FiO2<0.5) and severe (requiring oxygen

17

supplementation FiO2>0.5, high flow oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation) symptoms

18

eliminated the virus from upper respiratory tract later.

Dynamics of SARS‐CoV‐2 specific antibody response

We then characterized the kinetics of anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody appearance. Virus

22

neutralization ability was tested longitudinally utilizing the surrogate virus neutralization

test (sVNT) that quantified the ability of serum antibodies to inhibit the binding of Spike RBD

2

to ACE2 receptor in vitro (Tan et al., 2020). We also quantified anti‐RBD, anti‐S1 (S1 domain

3

of spike) and anti‐NP (nucleoprotein) IgG and IgM antibodies with a Luminex–based

4

quantification test that utilize beads coated with RBD, S1 domain of Spike and NP proteins

5

respectively (Figure 2A).

6

Figure 2B shows that all COVID‐19 patients developed neutralising antibodies with the

7

exception of patient P02 who nonetheless cleared SARS‐CoV‐2 at day 13 post symptom

8

onset (Figure 1). The peak neutralizing activity was achieved within 9‐15 days post symptom

9

onset. Of note, the two patients who first reached 90% virus neutralisation developed

10

severe disease (P05‐deceased and P03‐severe). The kinetics of anti‐RBD, anti‐S1 and anti‐NP

11

IgG also peaked around the 10‐20 days period, similar to previous observations (Isho et al.,

12

2020; Ripperger et al., 2020)with higher peak levels of antibodies against NP and Spike

13

detected in patient P05 who succumbed to the infection. Interestingly, when we analysed in

14

parallel the kinetics of appearance of antibody responses against different proteins, we

15

observed that patients with severe disease have an early NP‐biased antibody response,

16

while those with mild/moderate symptoms had either a spike‐dominant or balanced

17

response (Figure 2C). These kinetics of appearance is consistent with recent data (Atyeo et

18

al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020) showing that an anti‐nucleocapsid humoral response is

19

preferentially induced over a Spike IgG response in severe COVID‐19 patients.

Dynamics of SARS‐CoV‐2 specific cellular responses

We next analysed the kinetics of SARS‐CoV‐2 specific T cell appearance during the RT‐PCR

Membrane (M), ORF7ab, ORF8, ORF3a, the NSP7 and NSP13 of ORF1ab and a pool of ~40

2

peptides containing all the confirmed T cell epitopes of Spike were used to stimulate PBMC

3

in an IFN‐γ ELISPOT assay (Figure 3A). Since samples of PCR+ patients could not be handled

4

outside a BSL‐3 laboratory, a more detailed immunological analysis performed by flow

5

cytometry could only be performed after viral clearance (Supplementary Figure 1). During

6

the initial phase of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, the quantity of IFN‐γ secreting cells after

7

stimulation by the different peptides pools increased progressively with the peak of

8

frequency detected within ~15 days after symptom onset in the majority of the tested

9

patients (8 out of 12, Figure 3B and 3C) in line with a previous report (Weiskopf et al., 2020).

10

In two patients, peak responses were detected beyond 20 days after symptom onset, while

11

patient P05, who succumbed to disease before viral clearance, had no detectable IFN‐γ

12

secreting cells when stimulated with the different peptide pools until day 26 when

13

stimulation with Spike peptides activated a weak response (Figure 3B). Importantly, large

14

production of IFN‐γ was detected at all time points in all patients after stimulation with

15

PMA+Ionomycin, showing that global cellular functionality was not compromised (Figure 4A

16

insert). The frequency of IFN‐γ secreting cells reactive to all the different peptide pools was

17

also quantified at least 1 month after resolution of infection. The magnitude of the IFN‐γ

18

response declined massively in 7 out of the 8 patients tested (Figure 3B), consistent with the

19

waning of the cellular immune response that follows resolution of acute infection. The

20

quantity and time of appearance of SARS‐CoV‐2 peptide‐reactive cells was then analysed in

21

relation to the virological and clinical parameters.

22

First, we observed that in contrast to the antibody quantity, the overall magnitude of SARS‐

23

CoV‐2 peptide‐reactive cells was not proportional to the severity of disease. Figure 2B shows

24

that while higher quantities of IgG were observed in patients with severe compared to mild

COVID‐19, an opposite pattern was detected when the total IFN‐γ response detected after

2

stimulation by all the peptide pools was calculated. Higher frequencies of IFN‐γ secreting

3

cells both in the early (day 1‐15) as well as late stages (day 15‐30) were present in mild but

4

not in the severe COVID‐19 patients (Figure 3B and 3C). In addition, by analysing the

5

association between the time of SARS‐CoV‐2 T cell appearance and the length of infection,

6

we observed a statistically significant direct correlation between the early appearance of

7

SARS‐CoV‐2 peptide‐reactive cells (specific for NP, ORF7/8, ORF3a, M and Spike) and shorter

8

duration of infection (Figure 3D). In contrast, no correlation was observed when we

9

analysed the time of antibody and the length of infection. The temporal association of SARS‐

10

CoV‐2 specific T cell appearance with reduced length of infection suggest that T cells play an

11

essential role in the control of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

12
13

Hierarchy of T cell immunogenicity towards different SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins

14

Finally, we performed a granular analysis of the ability of different SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins to

15

stimulate IFN‐y production in severe and mild cases of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Peptide pools

16

covering all the different structural proteins (M, NP, ORF3a and Spike) and the ORF7/8

17

accessory proteins stimulate IFN‐y production from the PBMC of all the acute patients with

18

the exception of patient P05 (Figure 4A). In line with our previous report, NSP7 and NSP13

19

pools were rarely able to trigger IFN‐y response in COVID‐19 patients(Le Bert et al., 2020). In

20

most of the acute patients, we observed the simultaneous presence of IFN‐y producing cells

21

specific for all the different peptide pools both during the acute phase of infection and at

22

convalescence (Figure 4A). Of note, we observed that the ORF 7/8 peptide pool triggered a

23

robust IFN‐y response preferentially in the early phases of infection and only in patients

with mild disease (Figure 3B and 4A). When we calculated the proportion of IFN‐y producing

2

cells triggered by different SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins at the time of first detection and at

3

convalescence (>30 days after viral clearance), we observed that ORF7/8 responses waned

4

almost completely at convalescence. In contrast, the proportion of cells stimulated by the

5

peptide pools covering other SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins remained unchanged (M, ORF3a and

6

Spike) or increased (NP) over time (Figure 4B). To demonstrate unequivocally that IFN‐y

7

secreting cells detected in our assays after peptide stimulation were indeed T cells, we

8

performed a flow cytometry phenotypic analysis of IFN‐y producing cells expanded after

9

SARS‐CoV‐2 peptide stimulation of PBMCs. Unfortunately, such characterisations was

10

performed only with PBMCs of SARS‐CoV‐2 patients at convalescence due to biosafety

11

regulations that prevented us from analysing PBMCs collected during active infection (RT‐

12

PCR positive) outside a BSL‐3 laboratory. As expected and already demonstrated, CD3+ T

13

cells produced IFN‐y after peptide pool stimulation (Supplementary Figure 1A). Most of the

14

peptide responsive T cells were CD4 cells but CD8 T cells specific to NP peptide pools were

15

also detected (Supplementary Figure 1B). We were also able to expand ORF7 or ORF8

16

specific T cells in 6 out of 7 patients in whom we detected, in the early phases of infection, a

17

robust population of IFN‐y producing cells after activation with the combined ORF7/8

18

peptide pools. Phenotypic analysis showed that these cells were all CD4 T cells. Thus even

19

though we were unable to directly demonstrate that CD4 T cells were responsible for the

20

IFN‐y response triggered by ORF7/8 pools during the early phases of infection, such

21

interpretation was strongly supported by the exclusive expansion of ORF7 and ORF8 specific

22

CD4 T cells in the convalescents.

Discussion

2

Despite the small number of patients analysed, our longitudinal analysis of the dynamics of

3

virological and virus‐specific immunological parameters during the acute phase of SARS‐

4

CoV‐2 infection revealed a positive relation between induction of SARS‐CoV‐2 specific T cell

5

responses and early control of infection. In addition, the quantity of virus‐specific T cells

6

present during the acute phase of infection was not proportional to the COVID‐19 severity

7

but was actually more robust in patients with mild disease. These data contrasted with the

8

recent analysis of SARS‐CoV‐2 specific T cells in COVID‐19 convalescent patients that

9

reported a positive association of the frequency of SARS‐CoV‐2 specific T cells with disease

10

severity(Peng et al., 2020). However in this work, the T cell response was measured in

11

patients who were already in the convalescent phase. Since our longitudinal analysis

12

showed that the frequency of SARS‐CoV‐2 specific T cells rapidly waned after SARS‐CoV‐2

13

clearance, the time of T cell analysis can significantly influence the magnitude of T cell

14

response detected. The most robust T cell response was detected in patients with

15

mild/moderate symptoms who cleared the virus early, while for example the patient with

16

severe disease who succumbed to infection developed only a weak and monospecific T cell

17

response detectable 26 days after symptom onset.

18

An opposite scenario was observed for antibodies. The two most severe COVID‐19 patients

19

studied here showed the most rapid and robust ability to achieve peak virus neutralisation

20

and the overall quantities of SARS‐CoV‐2 specific antibodies were higher in severe than

21

milder COVID‐19 cases. These data confirm the numerous observations that have linked

with increased disease severity. Due to the significant link between early induction of T cells

2

and shorter duration of the infection, the demonstration of the early induction of ORF7/8

3

specific cellular immunity can be of particular significance in viral control. For example, a

4

382 nucleotide deletion that truncates ORF7b and ORF8 leading to the elimination of ORF8

5

transcription had been reported at low frequencies in multiple countries (Su et al., 2020).

6

While the mechanism leading to the acquisition of the genomic change is unresolved, the

7

early induction of ORF7/8 specific T cells and a recent report of the robust early antibody

8

response to ORF8 in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection would suggest that an immune‐driven selection

9

process could be involved (Hachim et al., 2020). Given that this viral variant was associated

10

with a milder disease (Young et al., 2020), the early induction of ORF7/8 immunity is worthy

11

of further investigation. It remains difficult to explain why ORF7/8 specific T cells were

12

preferentially detected during the acute phase of infection. Recent findings show a

13

corresponding increase in ORF8‐specific antibodies during the early phases of SARS‐CoV‐2

14

infection (Hachim et al., 2020). However, there is no experimental evidences of a

15

preferential early expression of ORF7/8 proteins in SARS‐CoV‐2 infected cells that might

16

contribute to an increased immunogenicity of these accessory proteins in the early phases

17

of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. An alternative hypothesis is that pre‐existing immunological

18

memory to ORF7 or ORF8 might have caused a selective accelerated expansion of ORF7/8 T

19

cells since ORF7/8 specific T cells can be occasionally detected in archived PBMC samples

20

collected from healthy individuals before 2019 (Mateus et al., 2020). However, ORF7/8 is

21

only expressed by SARS‐CoV‐1 and SARS‐CoV‐2 with little homology to other seasonal

22

coronaviruses, hence the role of such peptide cross‐reactive cells is puzzling and calls for a

23

more detailed analysis of the effect of pre‐existing immunity in the control or pathogenesis

Methods

2

Study design

3

Patients (n=12) were enrolled in this study after being admitted to the hospital and

4

confirmed to be infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 based on a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 RT‐PCR test as

5

part of the PROTECT (National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Board reference

6

number 2012/00917) and Novel Pathogens (CIRB ref. 2018/3045) studies. All participants

7

provided written informed consent. Peripheral blood of acutely infected patients was

8

collected in Mononuclear Cell Preparation tubes (CPT, BD Vacutainer) and transferred at 4°C

9

to the biosafety level‐3 (BSL3) facility for same‐day processing. Blood from study

10

participants at convalescent time points was obtained and processed in BSL2 laboratories.

11

Six patients were male, six were female, their median age at time of admission was 52.5

12

years, ranging from 27 to 78 years. None of the patients received immunomodulatory

13

treatments during the study period.

14
15

Surrogate virus neutralization assay

16

sVNT assay to quantify the neutralising antibody response were performed as previously

17

described (Tan et al., 2020). Briefly, sera from acutely infected patients were prepared in

18

BSL3 containment and heat‐inactivated prior to sVNT assay. HRP‐conjugated RBD

19

(Genscript) were pre‐incubated with 1:20 diluted serum at 37°C for 1h, followed by addition

20

to the Fc‐chimeric human ACE2‐coated MaxiSORP ELISA plate (Nunc) for an hour at room

21

temperature. Colorimetric signal was developed using TMB substrate (KPL) after extensive

PBST washes and the reaction was stopped with 1M HCl. Absorbance reading at 450 nm and

2

570 nm were obtained using Hidex Sense microplate reader (Hidex).

Luminex analysis

5

SARS‐CoV‐2 RBD, S1 and N proteins (Genscript) were conjugated onto MagPlex microsphere

6

(Luminex) using xMAP antibody coupling kit (Luminex). SARS‐CoV‐2 spike and N proteins

7

specific antibodies were detected by pre‐incubation of 100‐fold diluted serum (in 1% BSA

8

PBS) with conjugated microspheres (1250 beads/antigen) for 1h at room temperature,

9

followed by 1:1000 diluted PE‐conjugated anti‐human IgG polyclonal antibody (eBioscience)

10

or PE‐conjugated anti‐human IgM antibody for 1h at room temperature. The signal was

11

detected using Luminex MAGPIX instrument.

12
13

IFN‐γ ELISPOT assay

14

15‐mer peptides that spanned the entire ORF of genes eight SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins (NP, M,

15

ORF7, ORF8, ORF3, S, NSP7, NSP13) and antibody responses to two SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins

16

(NP, S) were synthesised with 10 amino acids overlap and were grouped into pools of

17

approximately 40 peptides (Table S1). CPT tubes were centrifuged at 1500 rcf for 15 mins

18

and approximately 2 ml of mononuclear cells located on top of the polyester gel were

19

aliquoted and stored at ‐80°C. ELISPOT plates were prepared with IFN‐γ coating antibody

20

(MabTech) and peptides pools in 50 l AIM‐V medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific)

21

supplemented with 2% AB human serum (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) on the day of

22

incubation with PBMCs. Vials containing PBMCs were thawed at RT, 2U Benzonase

(SigmaAldrich) to remove remaining nucleic acids was added when fully thawed and

2

incubated for 15 mins before centrifugation at 1000 rcf for 10 mins. The cell pellet was

3

dissolved in 1 ml of AIM‐V medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 2%

4

AB human serum (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) before quantification at undiluted and

5

1:10 dilution using a Scepter 2.0 cell counter (Millipore). Approximately 2 x 105 PBMCs in

6

100 l per well were incubated in the presence of peptides overnight at 37°C and 5% CO2.

7

After 24 hours, inoculum was removed and plates were washed six times with PBS.

8

Biotinylated anti‐IFN‐γ antibody (MabTech) at a 1:2000 dilution in PBS/0.5% FCS was

9

incubated at RT for two hours, followed by six wash steps with PBS and incubation of

10

Streptavidin‐AP (MabTech) at a 1:2000 dilution in PBS/0.5% FCS at RT for one hour. After

11

another six PBS washes, 50l of KLP BCIP/NBT phosphatase substrate (SeraCare) was added

12

and incubated at RT in the dark for 5‐15 mins. The reaction was stopped by washing the

13

plate with water extensively when the chromogenic reaction produced clearly visible spots.

14

Subsequently, the plates were allowed to air‐dry and spot forming units (SFU) were

15

analysed using an Immunospot reader and software (Cellular Technology).

16
17

SARS‐CoV‐2 specific T cell lines

18

T cell lines were generated as follows: 20% of PBMC were pulsed with 10 μg/ml of the

19

overlapping SARS‐CoV‐2 peptides (all pools combined) or single peptides for 1 hour at 37°C,

20

subsequently washed, and co‐cultured with the remaining cells in AIM‐V medium (Gibco;

21

Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 2% AB human serum (Gibco; Thermo Fisher

22

Scientific). T cell lines were cultured for 10 days in the presence of 20 U/ml of recombinant

23

IL‐2 (R&D Systems).
