ABSTRACT

30

Since the first case of COVID-19 in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2

31

has spread worldwide and within a year has caused 2.29 million deaths globally. With

32

dramatically increasing infection numbers, and the arrival of new variants with increased

33

infectivity, tracking the evolution of its genome is crucial for effectively controlling the pandemic

34

and informing vaccine platform development. Our study explores evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in

35

a representative cohort of sequences covering the entire genome in the United States, through

36

all of 2020 and early 2021. Strikingly, we detected many accumulating Single Nucleotide

37

Variations (SNVs) encoding amino acid changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with a pattern

38

indicative of RNA editing enzymes as major mutators of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We report

39

three major variants through October of 2020. These revealed 14 key mutations that were

40

found in various combinations among 14 distinct predominant signatures. These signatures

41

likely represent evolutionary lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. and reveal clues to its

42

evolution such as a mutational burst in the summer of 2020 likely leading to a homegrown new

43

variant, and a trend towards higher mutational load among viral isolates, but with occasional

44

mutation loss. The last quartile of 2020 revealed a concerning accumulation of mostly novel

45

low frequency replacement mutations in the Spike protein, and a hypermutable glutamine

46

residue near the putative furin cleavage site. Finally, the end of the year data revealed the

47

presence of known variants of concern including B.1.1.7, which has acquired additional Spike

48

mutations. Overall, our results suggest that predominant viral sequences are dynamically

49

evolving over time, with periods of mutational bursts and unabated mutation accumulation.

50

This high level of existing variation, even at low frequencies and especially in the Spike-

51

encoding region may be become problematic when superspreader events, akin to serial

52

Founder Events in evolution, drive these rare mutations to prominence.

AUTHOR SUMMARY

58

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute

59

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused the death of more than 2.29

60

million people and continues to be a severe threat internationally. Although simple measures

61

such as social distancing, periodic lockdowns and hygiene protocols were immediately put into

62

force, the infection rates were only temporarily minimized. When infection rates exploded again

63

new variants of the virus began to emerge. Our study focuses on a representative set of

64

sequences from the United States throughout 2020 and early 2021. We show that the driving

65

force behind the variants of public health concern, is widespread infection and superspreader

66

events. In particular, we show accumulation of mutations over time with little loss from genetic

67

drift, including in the Spike region, which could be problematic for vaccines and therapies. This

68

lurking accumulated genetic variation may be a superspreader event from becoming more

69

common and lead to variants that can escape the immune protection provided by the existing

70

vaccines.

INTRODUCTION

73

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes

74

the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan,

75

China, when a number of severe pneumonia cases were reported [1]. By March 11th, 2020,

76

the COVID-19 outbreak was classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO)

77

[2] and as of early February 2021, more than 105 million COVID-19 cases have been confirmed

78

worldwide, while 2.29 million related deaths have been reported [3].

79

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus and a

80

member of the betacoronavirus genera, of the Coronaviridae family [4]. The viral envelope of

81

SARS-CoV-2 consists of the membrane (M), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S)

82

proteins (encoded by the ORF5, ORF4 and ORF2 respectively), crucial components of the

83

viral structure, but also necessary for the packaging of the viral RNA genome, and for viral

84

infectivity [5]. The S protein (also known as Spike glycoprotein), is a major contributor to

85

COVID-19’s pathogenesis and tropism, as it is responsible for SARS-CoV-2’s recognition,

86

fusion and entrance into host cells. The infection process initiates when the Receptor Binding

87

Domain (RBD; S1 subunit) of the S protein recognizes and binds the angiotensin-converting

88

enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor of the host, leading to fusion of the viral envelope with the cellular

89

membrane thanks to a hydrophobic fusion peptide sequence found in the S2 subunit of Spike

90

[6].

91

Entrance and subsequent release of the positive strand viral RNA genome in the host

92

cell, is followed directly by its translation into a variety of structural and non-structural proteins

93

crucial for the viral life cycle [7,8]. ORF1a and 1b are the first to be translated and encode the

94

polyproteins pp1a and pp1b, which are cleaved by the papain-like protease (PLpro) and the

95

chymotrypsin-like protease (also referred to as 3C-like protease; 3CLpro) [9]. This results in the

96

production of 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-11 from pp1a and nsp12-16 from pp1b) [9].

97

Together, these nsps are necessary for the viral life cycle as they regulate the assembly or are

98

components of the Replication-Transcription Complex (RTC) [10]. Nsp1 “hijacks” the

99

translational machinery of the host to prioritize viral protein expression [11], while Nsp2

100

modulates the host’s cell cycle progression, migration, differentiation, apoptosis, and

101

mitochondrial biogenesis [12]. Nsp4 interacts with nsp3 and other host proteins to facilitate

102

viral replication [5,12], while the nsp6 protein induces membrane vesicles [13]. Nsp12 functions

103

as an RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) and synthesizes the viral RNA with the help of

104

the cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 [14]. Nsp14 is also part of the RTC by virtue of its function as a

105

3’-5’ exoribonuclease proofreader, among other functions [15]. Additional RTC nsp proteins

106

are nsp9 (capable of binding to RNA), nsp10 (cofactor of nsp14 and nsp16), nsp13 (helicase

107

and 5’ triphosphatase), nsp15 (with N7-methyltransferase function) and nsp16 (with 2’-O-

108

methyltransferase function) [5,16]. Once the RTC complex is established, it produces copies

109

of negative-sense viral RNA, which are then used as templates for synthesis of the positive-

110

sense genomic RNA (through an obligatory double stranded RNA intermediate [17]). These

111

new copies of genomic RNA are either translated for the expression of new nonstructural

112

proteins or are assembled into virions toward viral release [5]. Finally, the N protein binds to

113

the newly synthesized positive-sense genomic RNA in the cytoplasm, forming the

114

ribonucleocapsid, which along with the M, S and E proteins, are transported to the endoplasmic

115

reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) for virion assembly. The virions exit the

116

Golgi via budding and are released out of the cell through exocytosis [8].

117

All these ORFs encode components crucial to the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Genomic

118

variants that alter the amino acid composition of any of these ORFs are of interest. Normally

119

such variants would arise from polymerase-induced mutations during viral replication.

120

However, SARS-CoV-2 (with a genome of ~30 kb) appears to mutate less frequently than

121

viruses with smaller genomes [18], a feature attributed to nsp14, which possesses 3’-5’

122

exoribonuclease proofreading function that repairs some of the RdRp generated errors [15].

123

Indeed, the majority of single nucleotide variants detected in viral genomes (65% of

124

documented mutations [19,20]) are C-to-U and A-to-G base changes, a likely result of the

125

action of RNA editing deaminases [21]. These enzymes of the APOBEC (Apolipoprotein B

126

mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like) and ADAR (Adenosine Deaminase Acting

127

on RNA) families are normally referred to as anti-viral [22-24]. They target C’s in single

128

stranded RNA (as is documented for APOBEC1 [25], APOBEC3A [26,27] and possibly

129

APOBEC3G [28]) or A’s in double stranded RNA (generated during viral genome replication–

130

a perfect substrate for ADAR enzymes) to generate transition mutations (C-to-U and A-to-I,

131

decoded as G) [23]. While RNA deamination in general (also referred to as RNA editing) is

132

normally thought of as anti-viral, there is no reason why it cannot power viral evolution as well,

133

and in fact, current data suggest it does so in SARS-CoV-2. Aside from single nucleotide

134

substitutions, there is experimental evidence that, at least in vitro, this and earlier

135

coronaviruses (e.g. SARS-1) are capable of recombination, through template strand switching

136

[29].

137

Here, we have tracked the appearance of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome

138

through the first 12 months of the pandemic in the United States. Starting from aggregate

139

mutational profiles, we derived a number of mutational signatures, representing distinct

140

variants, which we have then tracked as they emerged across the U.S. in the course of the

pandemic over time. We report an increase of variant emergence and mutations per variant

142

with time, underscoring the need for continued mitigation even in the context of a successful

143

vaccination strategy. Finally, a few of the variants we identify from early 2021 are evolved

144

versions of the British variant of concern (B1.1.7) further underscoring the urgency of a dual

145

strategy of mitigation and vaccination.

147

RESULTS

148

SNVs accumulate progressively with time throughout the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

149

The SARS-CoV-2 isolates analyzed in this study come from infected American

150

individuals collected between January 19th 2020 and January 6th 2021 and encompass 8171

151

sequences. The number of sequences and locations where they are obtained from are shown

152

in Fig S1. Although viral isolate numbers decrease right after the first wave, a second increase

153

in daily isolate numbers starts from late July onwards. The number of SNVs per viral isolate

154

increases progressively over time (Fig 1A), indicating the virus is not keeping a static genomic

155

profile during the course of the pandemic and is instead accumulating diversity.

156

The kinds of substitutions that characterize the aggregate viral SNV profile are

157

predominantly C>T changes, with A>G, G>T and T>C also abundantly represented (Fig 1B)

158

among all mutations. When examining the mutation pattern among unique (non-ancestral)

159

synonymous changes in an effort to better understand the mechanism generating variability in

160

SARS-CoV-2, we found that C to T (U) and T (U) to C transitions are over-represented among

161

synonymous changes (Table 1; synonymous changes typically roughly represent 1/3 of the

162

mutations). The large number of C to U mutations (by far the most common mutation when

163

only unique mutations are considered) regardless of whether they generate a replacement or

164

not, combined with their excess representation among synonymous changes, suggest the

165

intrinsic signature of the mechanism generating mutations in SARS-CoV-2 involves the

166

generation of C to T mutations with a secondary smaller bias for T to C. These base

167

substitution patterns add to the increasing chorus in the literature that the APOBEC family of

168

RNA editing enzymes may be contributing to SARS-CoV-2 diversity (not entirely surprising

169

considering their known roles in antiviral activity [20,21,24]). In certain ORFs, C to T changes

170

were predominant (Fig 1C) while others deviated from the intrinsic mutational signature such

171

as ORF2 encoding spike, suggesting the intrinsic pattern may be masked by positive selection

172

for other mutations in ORF2.

In our viral isolate cohort, fourteen specific missense mutations were found at high

177

frequencies in the aggregate sequence data (Fig 2A; Table 2) suggesting they were under

178

positive selection. Mutations that appear in more than 10% of the retrieved sequences whose

179

frequency over time profile suggest at least three major variants include following:

180

(1) in ORF1a, a Threonine-to-Isoleucine (T>I; T265I) change is present at about 48.79%

181

of the sequences leading to a recoding effect in the Nsp2 protein (also found in [30]),

182

which is one of the first viral encoded proteins to initiate the viral life cycle, as well as a

183

Leucine-to-Phenylalanine (L>F; L3352F) in 12.98% of sequences, recoding the

184

peptidase C30. The frequency of this mutation follows a specific pattern (pattern A. Fig

185

2B), where it has overall increased over time concurrently with other mutations of the

186

same pattern as mentioned below.

187

(2) In ORF1b, a Proline-to-Leucine (P>L; P4715L in 82.03% of sequences) appears to be

188

the most frequent mutation found in our cohort and has been previously also found in

189

[31]. In the same ORF, Y5865C (Y>C) and P5828L (P>L) represent recoding changes

190

affecting the DNA/RNA helicase domain, and N6054D and R7014C represent amino

191

acid changes in Nsp14 and Nsp16 respectively [32]. Not all of these mutations follow

192

the same frequency patterns (for example P4715L, P5828L and Y5865C, and R7014C

193

follow distinct patterns (Figure 2B)).

194

(3) In ORF2 an Aspartic-acid-to-Glycine (D614G) change (in 80.76% of sequences),

195

(pattern B, Figure 2B), maps between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the S2

196

subunit of the spike. This change has been extensively noted in the literature as a

197

variant associated with an increase in infectivity and appears to have originated in

198

Europe [33].

199

(4) In ORF3a, a Glutamine-to-Histidine (Q>H; Q57H) mutation (~57.62% of the sequences

200

- pattern B, Figure 2B) is also found along with a G172V (G>V) change [34] (pattern A,

201

Figure 2B), both recoding the viroporin protein of SARS-CoV-2 [35].

202

(5) Mutations in the Ig-like (ORF8) and Nucleocapsid (ORF9) proteins of SARS-CoV-2

203

have also been abundantly found: in the first an S24L, which follows a unique frequency

204

pattern (pattern D, Figure 2B), and an L84S change (pattern A, Figure 2B), both at

205

about 15% frequency) [36] and in the latter a P199L change [37] and a P67S alteration,

206

which has not been previously documented, at about 10% of the sequences (with a

frequency pattern A – Figure 2B).

The identified patterns of specific mutation groups with near identical “frequency over time”

215

profiles suggest at least three major variants were present in the United States at various time

216

points in 2020. Some of the mutations are found more frequently earlier in the pandemic rather

217

than later (pattern C; Fig 2B) which correlate with the original Wuhan strain and its early

218

derivatives.

219
220

Mutational signatures over the SARS-CoV-2 genome suggest a combination of genetic

221

drift and selection

222

From our sequence cohort, we determined all potentially distinct mutation combinations

223

among sequences to get a sense of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. We

224

found 48 distinct putative signatures (s0-s48) that ranged from extremely rare (1 genome) to

225

frequent (in more than 10% of the genomes) (Fig S2A). We focused on those signatures that

226

were present in more than 0.1% of the genomes (Fig 2C). Their prevalence as a function of

227

time was also evaluated (Fig 2C, S2B). Three major variants appear to have dominated the

228

landscape in the US in 2020. These include (a) the reference Wuhan sequence which

229

disappeared as of June 2020, (b) the D to G clade (D614G) and various lower frequency but

230

highly similar subvariants and (c) a group of signatures from that clade that appear to have

231

acquired multiple mutations as a burst event in the summer of 2020 (involving at least 5

232

missense mutations (Fig 2C)).

233

These signatures provide enough resolution to examine their distribution across states

234

through time. We focused on states from where sequences were reported both early in the

235

pandemic but also throughout the year. As is clear from Figure 3, significant divergence from

236

the original Wuhan strain is already apparent in mutational profiles of SARS-CoV-2 genomes

237

collected between March and May 2020 (part of the 1st wave). Several mutational signatures

238

become dominant over time and this pattern is specific to some states and seemed to be

239

anchored by the well-known D614G mutation. For example, in California, a diverse set of

240

signatures is present early on, but by the end of 2020, s6, s11, s22, s28 and s48 dominate.

241

Additionally, some signatures are also state-specific such as s41 in MA, and s42 in WI, both

242

very similar to the now ubiquitous s48 but that with the apparent loss of a single mutation in

243

that lineage (Fig 2C), likely through genetic drift. The net effect has been that sequence

244

diversity among viral isolates has increased with time but that diversity may come in bursts as

245

the one seen in the summer of 2020 leading to the s48 signature, likely a homegrown variant

246

(Fig 2C, 3). Intriguingly, one of the mutations that define s48, N6054D, appears to impact the

247

proofreading activity of SARS-CoV-2 [32], raising the possibility that the mutational burst may

248

also be associated with this mutation. These data clearly indicate the genome of SARS-CoV-

249

2 is not static and can adapt through mutation.

251

Appearance of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in the U.S.

252

The functional consequences of variant evolution are most obvious in the context of

Spike protein, as mutations in Spike could impact receptor recognition and infectivity (as well

254

as alter antibody binding and thus lead to immune evasion). Therefore, Spike variants are now

255

denoted as “variants of concern”. One of the first variants of concern was the D614G mutation

256

(clade G) [33], which is now found in the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 genomes (including all

257

genomes recently annotated as novel variants of concern, such as B.1.1.7). Indeed, D614G is

258

present in more than 80% of the sequences in our cohort in aggregate (Fig2A, Table 2), and

259

virtually all sequences from after the 2nd quartile of 2020 (Q2) have this mutation. In addition

260

to the previously described mutations of concern, we have detected 13 isolates with a H69/V70

261

deletion. Of these only three have an additional deletion at V143/Y144 (and additional

262

characteristic mutations which define them as B.1.1.7 lineage (Fig 4A-B) according to [38]. The

263

rest carry the H69/V70 deletion together with a handful of other mutations, matching the

264

B.1.375 lineage (Fig 4B). These 13 isolates, detected in the US after mid-November 2020 both

265

in East and West coasts, have continued to evolve. For example, a B.1.1.7 isolate in Florida

266

carries an additional K1191N mutation, and B.1.375 isolates with additional V578L and

267

C1236S mutations have been sequenced from Florida and California respectively. The

268

K1191N mutation in the HR2 domain of B.1.1.7 has been found in at least one other variant in

269

Bangladesh, suggesting this may be another problematic recurrent mutation under positive

270

selection [39]. These findings highlight the ongoing diversification of the Spike region.

271
272

Multiple low frequency missense mutations of unknown consequence are accumulating

273

in the region encoding the Spike protein that may warrant close surveillance.

274

Additional mutations were found in Spike region that are currently at very low

275

frequencies but present in at least 0.1% of sequences (a cutoff selected to minimize

276

sequencing error contribution to the analysis). The consequences of these mutations to

277

infectivity, severity of disease, or response to vaccination remain unknown. They include: L5F

278

(163 genomes), E780Q (83 genomes), P681H (74 genomes) and Q677H (68 genomes; see

279

below), and over 20 additional mostly unidentified amino acid replacing mutations (as

280

summarized in Fig 4C). None of these Spike mutations have been identified as problematic to

281

date, but they remain within the population at very low frequencies. Strikingly, these low

282

frequency spike mutations seem to be increasing over time as more and more mutations

283

accumulate in the 4th quartile - while only a couple have been lost likely from genetic drift (Fig

284

4C). We found that of these low frequency mutations, six are in the receptor binding domain

285

(RBD) (Fig. 4C) and include (with number of genomes in parentheses): V382L (35), L452R

286

(28), F490S (9), S494P (30), N501T (12), and A520S (11), which may have consequences for

287

binding affinities to the ACE2 receptor in human cells, infectivity and/or response to vaccines

288

developed to trigger antibody responses to the RBD of earlier strains. Moreover, we identified

289

two different amino acid substitutions at Q677: Q677R (A23592G) and Q677H (through two

290

different point mutations -G23593T and G23593C) which are very close to the furin cleavage

291

domain. This hypermutability at Q677 suggests that it is under strong selection. A series of low

292

frequency mostly novel mutations in Spike were detected and included (with number of

293

genomes in parentheses): I210V (9) T719S (9), E781Q (32), T860I (10), V1041F (13), V1176F

294

(10), and E1203Q (10). The entire list of low frequency mutations in Spike are shown in Fig.

295

4C. Finally, it is important to note that this low frequency variation in Spike currently present

296

within the US population, may be potentially one superspreader event away from prominence,

297

and could lead to problematic new mutations or variants.

DISCUSSION

300

Among positive strand RNA viruses, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 has been thought to

301

be remarkably stable – in part because it has proofreading functionality during RNA synthesis

302

- a function carried out by nsp14 [15]. However, this notion of stability has come under scrutiny

303

with the emergence of multiple variants, some threatening the effectiveness of vaccines, and

304

many coinciding in convergently acquired spike mutations [40]. Indeed, though lacking the

305

diversity seen in HIV-1 variants [41], SARS-CoV-2 is fully capable of acquiring mutations that

306

enhance its ability to spread and evade immune responses.

307

In this study, we aimed to examine SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United States during

308

the first year of the pandemic. We were interested in sampling the existing variation, how

309

variant frequency changes over time and across states and finally, in the potential identification

310

of either new variants or novel mutations in pre-existing variants that have arrived from other

311

parts of the world. We also examined whether the pattern of mutations, particularly among

312

synonymous sites, could provide a clue as to how, despite its proofreading exoribonuclease

313

activity, SARS-CoV-2 has accumulated significant genetic variation.

314

For this study, we obtained 8171 full length sequences from Covid19 patients from

315

January 2020 through January 2021 from 42 US states. It is important to note that a majority

316

of the data was obtained from a handful of states (California, Florida, New York, Maryland,

317

Massachusetts, Minnesota, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Washington (Fig S1B)), likely a

318

combination of available genome surveillance programs, and rates of infection in those states.

319

We identified several distinct variants (Fig 2C, S2A) that can be categorized as follows: 1) The

320

original Wuhan strain and a few descendants with minor changes. This strain lacks the D614G

321

change that emerged in Europe early in the pandemic (G-clade). The reference strain and its

322

minor subvariants appear to have been lost in most states by early to mid-summer (Fig. 3); 2)

323

Two versions of the G-clade European strain defined by the acquisition, in an intermediate

324

within the clade, of multiple mutations within a short period of time in the summer of 2020,

325

leading to the now predominant likely homegrown variant s48 signature (Fig 2C). Our analysis

326

is not compatible with the notion that the burst of mutations originated from a recombination

327

event; rather these mutations appear instead to arise from the acquisition of multiple single

328

base substitutions that increased in frequency in the population relatively quickly, likely through

329

serial Founder Events. However, a few examples of lone mutations shared across variants

330

suggest the possibility of recombination or convergent evolution. Bursts of mutations may also

331

originate from patients with persistent infection despite treatment with convalescent plasma

332

where pressure for immune escape variants may be prolonged and intense [42,43].

333

Strikingly, the main variants in the US accumulated an increasing number of mutations

334

over time (Fig 1A, 2B-C, 3, S2B). This underscores the fact that with uncontrolled infection,

335

the appearance of new mutations will increase – and this will augment the probability of the

336

emergence of variants that alter the efficacy of vaccines or other therapeutics (e.g. monoclonal

337

antibodies). Of particular concern is our finding that over the last year in the United States,

338

over 20 amino acid replacing mutations arose in the Spike protein that have not been identified

339

yet as problematic, many still remaining in the population but currently at low frequencies (less

340

than 1%, Fig. 4C). Typically, mutations need to reach non-trivial frequency levels to survive

341

genetic drift and loss from the population. However, the number of amino acid replacements

342

impacting ORF2 encoding Spike seems to be increasing over time, with little corresponding

343

loss of variation through drift (Fig. 4C). This low frequency variation in Spike is of concern

344

because of the number of superspreader events in the US population leading to serial Founder

345

Events that can increase the frequency of these rare mutations. Variation reaching non-trivial

346

frequencies through superspreader events can then be subjected to positive selection in viral

347

evolution which can come in the form of host immune escape variants: such as arising in

348

immunocompromised patients receiving convalescent plasma [42,43], or in inadequately

349

vaccinated individuals (e.g. having only received a single dose of a two-dose vaccine

350

regiment), or by outperforming other variants through easier spreading for example. The latter

351

may be the reason the D614G variant became the dominant form in most countries [44,45].

352

Superspreader events may effectively work as Founder Events in this pandemic. In

353

Founder Events, where a few organisms initiate a new population, typically most genetic

354

variation is lost [46]. However, multiple or serial Founder Events originating from a population

355

can potentiate the generation of new species (or variants in this case) by providing a

356

mechanism for rare mutations to quickly increase their frequency [47]. Therefore, in

357

considering the generation of diversity of SARS-CoV-2, superspreading events is another

358

mechanism, besides mutation, where the virus can effectively increase its diversity over the

359

population. Given this, it is a reasonable possibility that current low frequency Spike mutations

360

may develop into problematic variants through superspreader events. This provides a

361

compelling reason to adhere to strict mitigation controls especially in the context of gatherings

362

with potential to become superspreader events. Minimizing such events is likely critical to

363

control the generation of clinically relevant variants.

364

Deservedly, a lot of attention has been given to variations in the ORF encoding spike

365

protein (Orf2), since any immune escape mutants are likely to arise particularly (though not

366

exclusively) within the receptor binding domain of Spike, that interacts with the ACE2 receptor

367

[48]. Among variants in Spike, we detected rare instances of the B 1.1.7 variant (3 cases in

368

November in California and Florida) and 10 of the B1.375 variant, recently identified as having

369

the H69/V70 deletion similar to B 1.1.7 but lacking most of the other distinguishing mutations
14

370

of B.1.1.7 [49]. This novel lineage (B.1.375) is another example of the H69/V70 deletion been

371

found in independent variants, suggesting it evolved convergently multiple times in SARS-

372

CoV-2 variants (as recognized by others [50]) even among different species [51]. Recent

373

models suggest that the H69/V70 deletion may be a gateway alteration to more variation as it

374

may provide increased flexibility of the receptor binding domain to accommodate mutations in

375

the ACE2 receptor among individuals and/or species [48], but this remains speculative.

376

Specific caution is warranted with genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 genomes containing

377

this deletion (whether it is B1.1.7 or not) as it seems to be associated with the generation of

378

new variants of clinical relevance.

379

In addition to variants within the ORF encoding spike protein (Orf2), we and others

380

found significant variation in other Orfs such as Orf1a and 1b and others, including a 15bp

381

deletion in the region encoding NSP1, previously identified in Japan [52]. The functional

382

relevance of this variation is less clear but cannot be ignored as it may impact the virus ability

383

to replicate, infect other cells once inside the host, and even modulate the host immune

384

response (as has been observed for NSP1 [52]). Therefore, while these non-spike variants

385

may not impact vaccine efficacy, they may impact the severity of the disease and potentially

386

the spread of the virus by increasing its efficiency in hijacking host cells and lowering the viral

387

load threshold required to establish infection.

388

Because the SARS-CoV-2 genome is not as stable as initially thought despite its

389

proofreading activity, we examined the pattern of mutation among synonymous changes

390

throughout the 8171 SARS-CoV-2 genomes to try to establish the intrinsic signatures of the

391

mechanisms that result in SARS-CoV-2 mutations. Querying synonymous mutations, we found

392

that C-to-U and U-to-C transitions were abundant and among all mutations, C-to-U changes

393

were dominant. One source of C-to-U mutations in RNA is the APOBEC family of RNA editing

394

enzymes, some with anti-viral properties known to deliberately attack the genomes or RNA

395

viruses, such as in the case of Apobec3G and HIV [53]. The less frequent U-to-C mutations

396

could also be due to RNA modification events occurring on uracil, and decoded as cytosine;

397

modifications that could result in such a profile could include thiolation (e.g. 4-thio-uridine) or
15

398

aminocarboxypropylation (e.g. acp3U) events. Though these modifications have not yet been

399

reported to occur on mRNA, both can occur on tRNA [54,55]. Finally, A-to-G events are also

400

evident (and the likely result of adenosine deamination to inosine, decoded as guanosine,

401

which is catalyzed by ADAR proteins, whose preference for dsRNA targets could attract them

402

to double-stranded RNA intermediates of the viral replication process) – for example the

403

prominent G clade mutation (D614G) may be the outcome of an A-to-I deamination event at

404

position A23403).

405

While we are not the first to make the observation that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is a

406

target of modification enzymes [21, 56-58], the fact that (a) many of the mutations that have

407

given rise to variants of concern could be explained by such modification events, together with

408

the fact that (b) modification enzymes have a preference with regard to the nucleotides that

409

neighbor the base-to-be-modified, lead us to speculate that RNA modifications are a major

410

source of targeted mutagenesis of the viral genome. This would explain why emerging variants

411

(like the B1.1.7), rather than diverging in sequence, appear to be acquiring mutations common

412

to unrelated strains (e.g. the new acquisition of the E484K (GAA=>AAA mutation first defined

413

as concerning in the unrelated 501Y.V2 variant [59], which could be attributed to a modification

414

such as m1G, which can be decoded as A [60]). Overall, this may be good news, as it would

415

imply that the range of sequence alterations that can yield variants of concern is limited, and

416

can be effectively targeted by novel vaccination strategies. This does not eliminate the

417

potential for recombination as another source of variation, as seen often in coronaviruses [29],

418

however we did not detect evidence of recombination events in the sequences we queried

419

here.

420

A troubling implication of the emergence of Spike variants is the potential for the

421

concurrent development of antibodies that are optimal for the original strains but not for the

422

new strains which may lead to the development of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)

423

documented for other viruses and associated with the development of suboptimal antibodies

424

[61]. Fortunately, ADE has not emerged explicitly as a substantial concern with SARS-CoV-2

425

[62,63], although suspects are the MIS-C or MIS-A, the Kawasaki-like syndromes associated

426

with COVID-19 infection and re-infection both in children and more recently also in adults

427

[64,65].

428

From a public health perspective, this study underscores the critical importance of

429

mitigating infection levels and particularly, super-spreader events, as critical potential

430

generators of high frequency novel variants from the very low frequency existing and

431

increasing Spike mutation pool. Indeed, the finding of over 20 spike variants at low frequencies

432

in the population of the U.S., is concerning as this “lurking” genetic variation can quickly

433

emerge as novel variants through superspreader, Founder-like events in an expansion process

434

similar to genetic surfing [66,67]. All these considerations require, in addition to recommended

435

mitigation efforts such as social distancing and mask wearing, that large scale vaccination be

436

in accordance to the schedules used in the clinical trials leading to federal agency approval.

437

Further supporting this, are reports of problematic variants arising within individual

438

immunocompromised patients treated with convalescent sera [42] as these escape mutants

439

can clearly arise when subjected to low levels of anti-Spike protein antibody. This, and our

440

finding of potential “lurking” low frequency variants already within the population, dictate that

441

selection against this virus through vaccination be strong and that “taking the foot off the pedal”

442

(for example by allowing people to have a single dose, or by low second shot compliance) can

443

allow this existing variation to give rise to novel escape variants. This explicitly means that

444

vaccinating more people with a single dose, but delaying the second, could lead to suboptimal

445

protection and therefore mild selection pressure on the circulating variants, allowing for the

446

evolution of more robust escape mutants.

The NCBI SARS-CoV-2 Resources portal (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sars-cov-2/ )

451

was the source for all SARS-CoV-2 sequences employed in this study. To fulfill the criteria of

452

nucleotide completeness (complete coverage), 8171 viral isolate sequences were retrieved

453

and isolated from human infections in the USA. Sequences retrieved by the time of analysis

454

were isolated from infections reported between January 19th, 2020 and January 6th, 2021

455

(noted as “Collection Date” in the database). In our analyses we considered the collection date

456

as the most relevant parameter and interpreted our results according to this time frame.

457
458

Variant calling and annotation

459

As the reference genome, we considered the one isolated from patient-zero in Wuhan,

460

China (accession number NC_045512 in RefSeq). Alignments were performed with the

461

Multiple Sequence Alignment tool “Clustal Omega” [68,69], comparing each US state

462

separately against the reference genome. We used Clustal alignment outputs (with character

463

counts) as input for our python 3.8 script to call SNVs (Single Nucleotide Variation), which

464

incorporated from ‘biopython’ [70] alignment reading commands for outputs of variation from

465

the reference. Translation of SNVs to note amino acid changes were processed with an R

466

(4.0.2) script, which applied the genetic code on reference sequence to display amino acid

467

variation and thus highlight missense and silent mutations. Annotation of genomic variants with

468

regards to regions in the viral genome (organized into ORFs) was performed employing NCBI

469

RefSeq SARS-CoV-2 genome annotation, which is also publicly available in the NCBI SARS-

470

CoV-2 Resources portal. Most variants and evolutionary signatures called throughout the

471

dataset were visually inspected for validation of SNVs (and presumed amino acid changes).

472

For further analysis and processing different cut-off parameters were followed: as most

473

frequent variants in aggregate (Fig 2A, Table 1) we defined the missense mutations that are

474

present in at least 10% of the sequence cohort (>817 sequences), same cut-off was for the

475

nucleotide changes, but including both silent and missense mutations. For the low frequency

476

Spike mutations, we considered the Spike missense mutations present in more than 0.1% of

477

the sequences.

478

For detecting specific deletions (eg ΔH69/V70) we employed the BLAST (Basic Local

479

Alignment Search Tool) command line application, by calling for gap-containing sequences

480

compared to the reference, in a locally-constructed database with all viral isolate sequences

481

(n=8171) satisfying the aforementioned criteria.

Mutational signatures analysis

484

We defined sequences with distinct combinations of the most frequently detected

485

mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes as mutational signatures (Figure 2A; Table 2). All unique

486

combinations were called to build a reference of putative mutational signatures (Fig S2A). We

487

focused on those signatures that were found in more than 0.1% of the sequences (>8). Time-

488

scaled phylogenetic tree of the major signatures (>0.1%) was constructed with IQ-TREE 2

489

[71].

490
491

Statistical analyses and visualization

492

All statistical analyses and visualizations were performed in R programming language

493

(v. 4.0.2) employing the R stats package, as well as the Tidyverse (v. 1.3.0) [72], pheatmap (v.

494

1.0.12), dendextent (v. 1.14.0) [73], msa [74], treeio [75] and ggtree [76].

730

(Collection Date), indicating their aggregation in SARS-CoV-2 genomes. (B) Distribution of

731

substitutions at unique SNVs. Two of the most frequent SNV substitutions, C>T and A>G, have

732

been previously associated with APOBEC and ADAR deaminase activities, on the SARS-CoV-

733

2 ssRNA(+) genome or its dsRNA intermediate, respectively. (C) Graphical representation of

734

SNV substitution profiles at various SARS-CoV-2 ORFs, illustrating intrinsic mutational bias

735

for C>T dominating the mutation pattern in some ORF’s (i.e. 1a and 1b), but being masked

736

(likely by selection) in other ORF’s like ORF2 encoding Spike region.

739

(A) Dot plot representation of missense mutations identified in the SARS2-CoV-2 genome, of

740

which fourteen were found in the most abundant SNVs, including Threonine-to-Isoleucine (T>I)

741

and Proline-to-Leucine (P>L) change in ORF1b (present in about 48.79% and 80.2%) of the

742

sequences, respectively) and the well-documented Aspartic-acid-to-Glycine (D>G) change in

743

ORF2 (found in 80.76% of the sequences). A summary further detailing these predominant

744

mutations is provided in the Table 1 and Supplementary File 1. (B) Density histograms

745

(showing how the most common mutations from Fig 2A change over time), reveal that the most

746

common mutations can be grouped into four distinct patterns (A-D); these mutational co-

747

occurrences thus indicate the presence of at least three major variants. (C) Unique profiles of

748

co-occurring mutational signatures from the dataset were employed to compile 48 sub-variant

749

putative signatures (s1-s48; Figure S2A) distinct from the original Wuhan viral isolate (s0). 14

750

signatures and the s0, were found in more than 0.1% of the sequences. Time-scaled

751

phylogenetic tree of those 14 subvariants and s0 (highlighted in red) reveals accumulation of

752

mutations and more complex signatures with an acute burst of mutations in the summer of

753

2020 likely leading to a novel homegrown variant (s48). The first and last sequences by time

754

profiled (per signature) are denoted with light blue and red dots respectively. The reference

756

denoted with red letters for each specific mutation, while loss with grey. The most abundant

757

Figure 3. SARS-CoV-2 viral isolate signatures change over time, but with different

760

patterns across states, showing dynamic evolution by mutation, drift and selection.

761

Shown are state-specific ridgeline plots of the density of each signature (y axis) over collection

762

date (x axis). In each plot, peak colors gradually change to highlight transition in time (x axis),

763

with the pink-shaded areas corresponding to the periods of time where data was not available.

764

States shown were selected by sequence abundance throughout the year. Of note, the

765

reference strain s0 is virtually absent by June 2020, while signatures s6, s48, s22 are dominant

766

by late 2020.

774

profiling of the 13 isolates shown in Fig 4A, collected from individuals after November 19th,

775

2020 (primarily in CA and FL). All isolates were either B.1.1.7 variants (3), or B.1.375 (10)

776

which lacked the ΔV143/Y144 deletion. Also of note, novel spike mutations were found in a

777

B.1.1.7 lineage isolate in FL (K1191N), as well as in two B.1.375 sequences (V758L and

778

C1236S in FL and CA, respectively). Dot entries in the last column denote the absence of

779

additional mutations. All mutations found in the Spike region of these isolates are summarized

805

January 6th, 2021 (8171 in total from SARS-CoV-2 NCBI portal; see Methods), highest

806

numbers were in mid- to late-March 2020. (B) States with the most sequences were WA, WI,

S2 Figure. Associated information with Figures 2 and 3. (A) Heatmap summarizing all the

811

putative signatures (columns) built by the unique combination of dominant mutations (rows).

812

Signatures are ranked from left to right by the sequence number they were found in (red labels

813

below x axis). The first 15 signatures that are found in 0.1% of the sequences (>8) or more

814

were considered for the mutational signature analysis. Presence or absence of mutation in

815

each signature is denoted with blue or light yellow respectively. (B) Signatures that were found

816

in more than 0.1% of the viral isolates in aggregate were further explored in the context of time

817

from emergence till early 2021. Viral isolates that were profiled with those signatures (s0, s1-

818

2, s6-8, s11-12, s22, s28, s34, s41-42, s48), were ordered by collection date in the columns of

819

the heatmap from left to right. The heatmap visualizes the % occurrence (light yellow to dark

820

blue scale) of each signature per collection date in the cohort of sequences. Column annotation

821

(bottom of the heatmap) denotes the different quartiles (Q1-Q4) of calendar year 2020 (very

822

few entries from Q1 of 2021 are shown) in which the sequences were collected. The non-

823

variant SARS-CoV-2 (s0) is present primarily in the in Q1 up to mid-Q2 of 2020. While a diverse

824

set of signatures appears in the USA from the start of the pandemic onward, subvariants

825

currently circulating in the American population are variations of s48, s22 and s6 (with some

826

variation per state).
