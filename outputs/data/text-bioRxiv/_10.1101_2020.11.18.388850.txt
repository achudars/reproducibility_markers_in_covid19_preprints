Abstract
There is an urgent need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the
transmissibility and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is a host ectopeptidase with welldescribed anti-inflammatory and tissue protective functions and the receptor for the
virus. Understanding SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 interaction and the expression of antiviral host
genes in early infection phase is crucial for fighting the pandemic. We tested the
significance of soluble ACE2 enzymatic activity longitudinally in positive nasopharyngeal
swabs at two time points after symptom consultation, along with gene expression
profiles of ACE2, its proteases, ADAM17 and TMPRRS2, and interferon-stimulated genes
(ISGs), DDX58, CXCL10 and IL-6. Soluble ACE2 activity decreased during infection course,
in parallel to ACE2 gene expression. On the contrary, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced
expression of the ISG genes in positive SARS-CoV-2 samples at baseline compared to
negative control subjects, although this increase wanes with time. These changes
positively correlated with viral load. Our results demonstrate the existence of
mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 suppress ACE2 expression and function casting doubt
on the IFN-induced upregulation of the receptor. Moreover, we show that initial
intracellular viral sensing and subsequent ISG induction is also rapidly downregulated.
Overall, our results offer new insights into ACE2 dynamics and inflammatory response
in the human upper respiratory tract that may contribute to understand the early
antiviral host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the COVID-19
disease1. SARS-CoV-2 infection is manifested in a wide range of symptoms2,3, with the
risk for increased disease severity correlating with male sex, advanced age and
underlying comorbidities4,5.
One of the hallmarks of COVID-19 is a dysregulated antiviral immune response6,7.
Interestingly, ACE2 expression is reported to be induced upon exposure to interferon
(IFN)8, following SARS-CoV-2 infection, in contrast with data from SARS-CoV, where
cellular ACE2 expression levels are downregulated by viral infection and linked with the
pathogenicity of the virus9. SARS-CoV-2 may also antagonize initial viral sensing and IFN
responses10,11, although the mechanism is still unknown and the temporal relationship
between viral load and host gene expression, has not been explored in vivo. At gene
transcription level, shotgun RNA sequencing profiles of nasopharyngeal samples from
infected subjects associated IFN stimulated gene (ISGs) expression with viral load, age
and sex12. In this context, the in-depth analysis of nasopharyngeal samples may help to
decipher the intricate processes of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the host immune response.
Gathering this information must be crucial to better understand how the initial phase of
infection may compromise the disease progression.
ACE2 is also known to be a tissue-damage protective factor, due to its
monocarboxipeptidase actions on Angiotensin (ANG)-II promoting anti-inflammatory
functions through Ang-(1-7) production. These two peptides of the renin angiotensin
system (RAS) are involved in the regulation of blood pressure and body fluid
homeostasis13–15. ACE2 ectodomain is released from the cell surface by ADAM17 and

TMPRSS216,17carboxipeptidases, being TMPRSS2 also necessary for SARS-CoV-2 viral
entry due to its function in the priming of viral S protein 16. Interestingly, once released,
the ectodomain of ACE2 keeps the catalytic activity, which is able to cleave circulating
vasoactive peptides16,17. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it might significantly
influence viral spread and pathogenesis, either by limiting new viral infections acting as
a soluble decoy or alternatively, by reducing local inflammation due to its tissue
protective function.
Thus, studies focused on key molecular mechanisms early after SARS-CoV-2 infection
are of great value to better decipher the inflammation cascade and immune signalling
in the initial phase of the disease. Moreover, the role of IFN in ACE2 expression and
shedding should be deeply evaluated because of the important implications in
modulating inflammatory cytokines. Here, we evaluated the interplay between ACE2
function and host immune response in nasopharyngeal samples of a cohort of SARSCoV-2 infected subjects, delineating how viral infection modulates both ACE2 expression
and function in vivo, as well as, its relation with immune response and viral load.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to loss of ACE2 function and expression in upper
respiratory tract
Because of the central role of ACE2 receptor as the viral entry point, deciphering the
ACE2 functional role is critical for the understanding of the pathophysiological changes
due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 viral entry might trigger cleavage of
ACE2 receptor ectodomain, affecting ACE2 function and systemic release.
To gain insight into ACE2 function in viral entry and early infection events, we
standardized the measurement of soluble ACE2 enzymatic activity in nasopharyngeal
swabs as a surrogate marker of ACE2 function in upper respiratory tract (Supplementary
fig 1). We observed significant lower ACE2 enzymatic activity levels in nasopharyngeal
swabs than in serum samples, but suggesting a potential role of ACE2 activity in the
upper respiratory tract in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.
Thus, soluble ACE2 activity was measured in a cohort of acute infected SARS-CoV-2
subjects, confirmed by a positive PCR diagnostic test and in a group of uninfected
controls, matched by age and sex. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the
infected subjects included in the study are summarized in Table 1. SARS-CoV-2 positive
subjects were longitudinally followed with a first sample at the time of the recruitment
(day 0) and a second nasopharyngeal swab 3 days later. ACE2 activity did not
significantly differ in SARS-CoV-2 positive compared to negative subjects, although a
trend to a higher activity in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples was observed (Fig 1A).
Interestingly, ACE2 activity at day 3 was significantly lower than the first sample (Fig 1A,
p-value=0,0048), supporting the idea that ACE2 cleavage and release occurs upon viral
entry and its function is not recovered thereafter.

When samples were stratified according to sex, ACE2 activity levels were higher in SARSCoV-2 positive males compared to females, irrespective of the day of sampling (Fig 1B,
p-value= 0,0008 and p-value=0,009 for day 0 and 3, respectively), in line with previous
reports showing higher plasma ACE2 levels in men18,19 .
We next explored the temporal relationship of ACE2 gene expression in nasopharyngeal
swabs from our cohort of positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 subjects. Surprisingly, ACE2
gene expression was significantly lower in positive SARS-CoV-2 than in negative samples
(Fig 1C), in contrast to previous reports indicating IFN-dependent upregulation of ACE2
expression upon SARS-CoV-2 infection8. Moreover, when comparing ACE2 gene
expression longitudinally in positive samples, ACE2 expression showed a significant
decrease overtime, following the same trend observed with ACE2 enzymatic activity,
suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is able to downregulate the expression of its receptor. No
significant differences in ACE2 gene expression were observed when samples were
stratified by sex (Fig 1D).
ACE2 function and expression correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load in infected
subjects
SARS-CoV-2 viral load was quantified by RT-qPCR at the same timepoints were ACE2
activity and gene expression were determined, to unravel putative interactions between
soluble active ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 infection. As previously reported, viral load
significantly decreased from day 0 to day 3 (mean of 2 log reduction, p-value=6,5x10-07,
Supplementary fig 2A), showing a similar reduction to that observed for ACE2 expression
and parallel to the trend observed for ACE2 activity. No differences in viral load were
identified when data was stratified by sex (Table1 and Supplementary fig 2B).

Interestingly, a significant positive correlation was found between ACE2 activity drop
and viral load decrease overtime, i.e., the higher the decrease in viral load, the higher
the decrease in soluble active ACE2 (spearman correlation coefficient rho=0.355, pvalue=0.0246, Fig 2A). Indeed, ACE2 gene expression also directly correlated with viral
load (spearman correlation coefficient rho=0.352, p-value=0.0259 Fig 2B), strongly
suggesting a direct link between viral entry and ACE2 expression and function.
SARS-CoV-2 infection modulates ISG gene expression
To further explore gene expression modulation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, mRNA
expression of TMPRSS2 and ADAM17, the proteases able to cleave ACE2 ectodomain,
together with distinct ISG genes were also measured. In the case of TMPRSS2 and
ADAM17 expression, there were no significant differences in longitudinal samples
obtained at different timepoints of SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects, although TMPRSS2
expression was decreased in infected subjects compared to uninfected controls (Fig 3A,
p-value<0.01).
On the contrary, significantly higher expression of the ISG genes, DDX58 (RIG-I), CXCL10
and IL-6 genes was observed in positive SARS-CoV-2 samples at baseline compared to
uninfected subjects (Fig 3B, p-value<0.05 in all cases), albeit ISG expression decreased
at follow-up 3 days later, suggesting that viral infection is inducing an IFN-mediated
antiviral response that is rapidly counteracted by viral proteins10–12.
Interestingly, increased expression of ISGs was associated with higher viral load (Fig 3C)
but did not correlate with proteases expression (Supplementary Fig 3) supporting also
the idea that SARS-CoV-2 infection is inducing an antiviral response upon viral entry that
is afterwards suppressed to facilitate infection spread.

Discussion
In this study, we report changes in expression of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related genes and
the enzymatic activity of ACE2 in nasopharyngeal swabs contributing to understand the
biology of early viral infection. Overall, our findings show the modulation induced by
SARS-CoV-2 on its receptor, ACE2, at gene and soluble level throughout the first week
after infection in a cohort of mild COVID-19 subjects. This modulation seems to be
independent of the ISGs induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, also demonstrating that
ACE2 expression is not regulated by IFN. Moreover, we show that initial upregulation of
antiviral immune response is directly linked to viral load and its upregulation is rapidly
reversed within days during the course of infection. Our data adds key relevant
knowledge to the understanding of the early antiviral host response to SARS-CoV-2
infection at the site of viral infection.
Soluble ACE2 has been described as a risk factor of death or cardiovascular events
associated to several kidney or heart diseases20–23, and more recently, also reported in
general population19. The role of the circulating molecule has been discussed as a
feedback pathway to counterbalance the RAS and hyperinflammation activation. In our
study, this scenario is also plausible in the upper airway epithelium where viral entry
starts to induce the inflammatory cascade that may ultimately lead to the cytokine
storm24. Upon infection, soluble ACE2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs shows a slight
increase in enzymatic activity, probably due to the infection itself and/or the activity of
ADAM17 and/or TMPRS22 sheddases16. However, longitudinal evaluation of soluble
ACE2 in patient-matched samples showed a significant decrease, indicating that viral
infection is significantly affecting ACE2 function. Controversial observations have been
published regarding ACE2 gene expression in COVID-19 infection. Previous studies on

SARS-CoV linked the downregulation of ACE2 expression levels in the lungs with the
pathogenicity of viral infection as a mechanism to avoid protective levels of soluble
ACE29,25,26. On the other hand, Ziegler and colleagues by analysis of single-cell RNA-seq
datasets describe ACE2 as an IFN-stimulated gene in human epithelial tissues,
upregulated following SARS-CoV-2 infection8. A recent publication reports the discovery
of a truncated form of ACE2 gene (dACE2) as the IFN-inducible isoform of ACE2 not
acting as viral receptor nor as carboxipeptidase27. This finding would be in line with our
results showing no significant changes in ACE2 soluble activity upon SARS-CoV-2
infection, concomitant to a decrease in ACE2 gene expression. In contrast, a clear
induction of IFN stimulated genes is observed upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, also
supporting the idea that full length ACE2 is not an ISG and that viral infection is indeed
downregulating its expression9. Importantly, ACE2 expression and function correlated
with viral load, further stressing the key role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.
Indeed, age and sex differences in ACE2 expression have also been linked to COVID-19
susceptibility and disease outcome28, in concordance with our data showing higher ACE2
in males compared to females.
In the setting of COVID-19 infection, soluble ACE2 has been proposed as a treatment
against the spread of the virus. Clinically, changes in soluble ACE2 might imply a
decrease in membrane-bound ACE2 and indicate the pathophysiological status of the
patient. The presence of circulating ACE2 locally at the primary site of infection might
also have implications in disease progression as a feedback pathway to counterbalance
the RAS and hyperinflammation activation29. Parallel to the description on the biological
significance of circulating ACE2, other studies showed that soluble ACE2 might be
postulated as a protective molecule in some experimental models 25 or recently as

blocker for SARS-CoV-2 virus30. We can surmise that recombinant ACE2 might be a
locally applied treatment for the first days of infection. However, further studies in
extended cohorts with different infection outcomes are needed to unravel the clinical
significance of soluble ACE2 in particular settings and considering each clinical situation.
Although the virus-receptor interaction is needed to initiate infection, pathogenesis is a
multistep process and the development of disease is influenced by multiple factors, in
which target cell factors and the capacity of the host to develop a proper immune
response are key. Indeed, the fact that TMPRSS2, but not ADAM17 expression was
downregulated upon infection, might indicate the prominent role of TMPRSS2 in the
context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, we observed a significant
upregulation of CXCL10, IL-6 and RIG-I expression, all playing important roles in innate
immune activation and clearly indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces an antiviral
response characterized by ISG upregulation. Importantly, the highest levels of individual
ISG expression were seen in samples with the highest viral load. However, patientmatched longitudinal specimens showed a clear reduction in ISG-induced transcription
3 days later, demonstrating that the induction of an antiviral response rapidly wanes
with time. In concordance with our results, it is well established the capacity of
coronaviruses to manipulate immune responses and interfere with the IFN pathway,
with several structural proteins (M and N) and non-structural protein (NSP1 and NSP3)
from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV acting as interferon antagonists31.
Collectively, our results support the existence of IFN-independent mechanisms by which
SARS-CoV-2 suppress ACE2 expression and function. SARS-CoV-2 induction of ISGs at the
site of infection is temporary, suggesting that the virus may also suppress intracellular
viral sensing and subsequent ISG induction for favoring viral replication, although its

relative contribution to disease outcome cannot be solved due to the characteristics of
the studied cohort, all presenting mild forms of the disease. In depth evaluation of early
changes in innate immune activation at the site of infection in patients with distinct
disease severity may shed light on its putative effects on viral associated pathogenesis
that may lead to different infection outcomes.
Deciphering the regulation of the ACE2 and ISG expression and function in SARS-CoV-2
target cells is a step forward in linking ACE2 levels with viral damage and COVID-19
pathology, that may help to design better strategies to efficiently clear the SARS-CoV-2
virus and minimize tissue damage. On the other hand, understanding the innate immune
responses to SARS-CoV-2 and its immunoevasion approaches will improve our
understanding of pathogenesis, virus clearance, and contribute toward vaccine and
immunotherapeutic design and evaluation.

Materials and methods
Patients and samples
Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from 40 patients recruited under the BCN PEP
CoV-2 Study (NCT04304053) during the spring SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, in Catalonia
(North-East Spain). All COVID-19 cases included in the present analysis were nonhospitalized adults (i.e., ≥ 18 years of age) with quantitative PCR result available at
baseline and mild symptom onset who met the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 (fever,
or acute cough, or sudden olfactory or gustatory loss, or rhinitis). Two nasopharyngeal
swabs were obtained, at the time of recruitment (day 0) and at follow-up, 3 days after
(day 3). Full details of the original study are reported elsewhere32. Similarly, a group of
COVID-19 negative nasopharyngeal swabs (n=20) were collected following the same
procedure and matched by age and sex to the infected patients (mean age: 39 years and
70% females). All negative samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR with a
negative result.
The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Hospital Germans
Trias i Pujol. All participants provided written informed consent.
ACE2 enzymatic assay
The ACE2 fluorescent enzymatic assay protocol was performed as previously described23
with slight modifications, using an ACE2-quenched fluorescent substrate (Mca-Ala-ProLys(Dnp)-OH; Enzo Life Sciences). Swab samples (5μL) were incubated with ACE2 assay
buffer [100mM Tris-HCl, 600mM NaCl, 10μM ZnCl2, pH 7.5 in presence of protease
inhibitors 100μM captopril, 5μM amastatin, 5μM bestatin, and 10μM Z-Pro-prolinal
(from Merck-Sigma-Aldrich and Enzo Life Sciences)] and 10μM fluorogenic substrate in
a final volume of 100μL at 37°C for 18h. To test substrate specificity, ACE2-specific

inhibitor, MLN-4760 (Merck-Sigma-Aldrich) was added. Soluble ACE2 cleaves the
substrate proportionally to the enzyme activity. Measurements were carried out in
duplicate for each data point. Plates (Corning clear flat-bottom 96 well black polystyrene
plates) were read using a fluorescence plate reader (EnsightTM multimode plate reader,
Perkin Elmer) at λex320 nm and λem400 nm. Results were obtained after subtracting the
background and expressed as RFU (relative fluorescent units)/µL sample/hr.
SARS-CoV-2 PCR detection and viral load quantification. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was
quantified from nasopharyngeal swabs at the distinct time points by quantitative
reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). RNA extraction was performed using MagMAX™
Pathogen RNA/DNA Kit (Catalog number: 4462359, ThermoFisher), optimized for a
KingFisher instrument (ThermoFisher), following manufacturer's instructions. PCR
amplification was based on the 2019-Novel Coronavirus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic
Panel guidelines and protocol developed by the American Center for Disease control and
Prevention. Briefly, a 20 μl PCR reaction was set up containing 5 μL of RNA, 1.5 μL of N3
primers and probe (2019-nCov CDC EUA Kit, #10006770, Integrated DNA Technologies)
and 12.5 μl of TaqPath 1-StepRT-qPCR Master Mix (ThermoFisher). Thermal cycling was
performed at 50ºC for 15min for reverse transcription, followed by 95°C for 2 min and
then 45 cycles of 95°C for 3 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, in the Applied Biosystems 7500 or
QuantStudio5 Real-Time PCR instruments (ThermoFisher). For absolute quantification,
a standard curve was built using 1/5 serial dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 plasmid (2019nCoV_N_Positive Control, #10006625, 200 copies/μl, Integrated DNA Technologies) and
run in parallel in all PCR determinations. Viral load of each sample was determined in
triplicate and mean viral load (in copies/ml) was extrapolated from the standard curve
and corrected by the corresponding dilution factor.

Quantitative RT-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). For relative mRNA
quantification RNA extraction was performed using MagMAX™ Pathogen RNA/DNA Kit,
optimized for a KingFisher instrument (ThermoFisher) Reverse transcriptase was
performed using the TaqPath 1-StepRT-qPCR Master Mix (ThermoFisher). mRNA relative
levels of all genes were measured by two-step quantitative RT-PCR and normalized to
GAPDH using the 1/DCt method. All probes were purchased from Life Technologies
(TaqMan gene expression assays).
Statistical analysis
Given that the normality was not fulfilled by the majority of variables, non-parametric
methods were applied. Between group differences were evaluated trough MannWhitney U test. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to evaluate statistically significant
changes in paired samples within the SARS-CoV-2 positive cohort (baseline-3 days).
Correlation between variables were evaluated through Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficients. Results were considered as statistically significant at p-value<0.05.
Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 15.1.

Figure 1. Enzymatic activity and expression of ACE2 in nasopharyngeal swabs from
SARS-CoV-2 patients. (A) ACE2 enzymatic activity in negative (n=20, white squares, Neg)
or positive SARS-CoV-2 samples (n=40), collected at the time of PCR positivity (Pos D0,
black circles) and 3 days later (Pos D3, black triangles). (B) ACE2 activity in positive SARSCoV-2 females (black circles, F-Pos) and males (black triangles, M-Pos) collected at the
time of PCR positivity (D0) and 3 days later (D3). Data are expressed as individual relative
fluorescence units (RFU) per microliter/hour. (C) Relative mRNA expression of ACE2 gene
in negative (n=20, white squares, Neg) or positive SARS-CoV-2 samples (n=40) at the
time of PCR positivity (black circles, Pos D0) and 3 days later (black triangles, Pos D3). (D)
Relative expression of ACE2 in positive SARS-CoV-2 subjects stratified by sex (F-Pos,
female; M-Pos, male). The mean values are presented as horizontal lines. Data was
analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
