Abstract
The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
binds the cell surface protein ACE2 to mediate fusion of the viral membrane with target
cells1-4. S comprises a large external domain, a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a
short cytoplasmic tail5,6. To elucidate the intracellular trafficking of S protein in host cells
we applied proteomics to identify cellular factors that interact with its cytoplasmic tail. We
confirm interactions with components of the COPI, COPII and SNX27/retromer vesicle
coats, and with FERM domain actin regulators and the WIPI3 autophagy component. The
interaction with COPII promotes efficient exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and
although COPI-binding should retain S in the early Golgi system where viral budding
occurs, the binding is weakened by a suboptimal histidine residue in the recognition motif.
As a result, S leaks to the surface where it accumulates as it lacks an endocytosis motif
of the type found in many other coronaviruses7,8. It is known that when at the surface S
can direct cell:cell fusion leading to the formation of multinucleate syncytia9-11. Thus, the
trafficking signals in the cytoplasmic tail of S protein indicate that syncytia formation is not
an inadvertent by-product of infection but rather a key aspect of the replicative cycle of
SARS-CoV-2 and potential cause of pathological symptoms.

Main text
Coronavirus virions are encapsulated by a lipid bilayer that contains a small set of
membrane proteins including the S protein that binds to and fuses with target cells, and
the M protein that recruits the viral genome into the virion12-14. Virions of SARS-CoV-2
and other betacoronviridae also contain the minor structural envelope (E) protein15,16. In
infected cells, all three proteins are initially inserted into ER and are then trafficked to the
ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the Golgi where they are glycosylated
and, in the case of S, cleaved by Golgi enzymes17. Virions then form by budding into the
membranes of the ERGIC and Golgi, and membrane-bound carriers then transfer the
newly-formed virions to the surface for release from the cell18,19. Although SARS-CoV-2
and most other coronaviruses do not bud from the cell surface, some S protein is found
on the surface of infected cells. Consistent with this, infected cells have been observed to
fuse with neighbouring cells to form large multinucleate cells (syncytia)9,10,20.
The traffic of membrane proteins through the secretory pathway is typically mediated by
interactions between their cytoplasmic tails and the coat proteins that form the carriers
that move proteins and lipids between compartments. To investigate the mechanisms by
which S protein becomes distributed between the membranes of the host cell we sought
cellular factors that recognised its cytoplasmic tail. The 37 residue tail of S was
expressed as a GST fusion in bacteria and used for affinity chromatography of cytosol.
Proteins that bound preferentially to the tail fusion rather than GST alone were identified
by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a, and Supplementary Table 1). The
highest hits included several vesicle coat proteins and three related proteins, ezrin,
moesin and radixin, that link membrane proteins to actin. Ezrin was previously reported
as hit in a yeast two-hybrid screen with the cytoplasmic tail of S from SARS, and
suggested to have a role in restraining viral entry21. The vesicle coat proteins include
subunits of the coatomer complex that forms COPI-coated vesicles, consistent with a
previous report that coatomer binds to the closely related cytoplasmic tail of the S protein
of SARS22. In addition to these known interactors, there was a strong enrichment of
subunits of the COPII coat that forms ER-to-Golgi vesicles, and of the sorting nexin
SNX27 and its associated retromer complex that together recycle proteins from
endosomes to the cell surface23. The few other strong hits are not linked to membrane
traffic and were not investigated further, with the exception of WIPI3/WDR45B which
interacts with membranes to regulate autophagy24.

To dissect the roles of the different coat proteins we mapped the regions that they bind
on the 37 residue S protein tail (Fig. 1b,c). The tail comprises two distinct sections (Fig.
1d). The membrane proximal half (1234-1254) contains eight cysteines which are known
to be palmitoylated in the equivalent region in SARS and other coronaviruses and, once
modified, are likely to be embedded in the surface of the bilayer25,26. The distal half of the
tail (1255-1273) lacks cysteines and so will project into the cytoplasm. Testing GST
fusions to these two halves showed that all the interactors bound to the distal region with
the exception of SNX27 which exclusively bound to the cysteine-rich region (Fig. 1c,
Extended Data Figs. 1b and 2a). To map binding at higher resolution we tested tails with
adjacent pairs of residues mutated to alanine (Fig. 1b). COPII binding was reduced by
mutations in the acidic stretch DEDDSE that contains three copies of the di-acidic ER exit
motif that binds to the Sec24 subunit of the coat27,28. In contrast, COPI binding required
the residues in the C-terminal KXHXX motif that was also found to be required for this
interaction in SARS S protein22. The FERM domain proteins required residues between
the COPI and COPII binding sites, and SNX27 binding required residues in the Nterminal half of the tail nearest the TMD.
To further validate the interactions with SNX27, WIPI3 and the FERM domain proteins,
we used recombinant proteins to test direct binding. Moesin is known to interact with
plasma membrane proteins via its N-terminal FERM domain, and this part of the protein
bound directly to the S protein tail, with residues 1261SEPV being essential (Fig. 2a). The
autophagy regulator WIPI3, when expressed in E. coli, also bound directly to the
membrane distal half of the tail (Fig. 2b). Recombinant SNX27 also bound to the tail in
vitro, with residues 1238TSC next to the transmembrane domain being important, with
the same residues found to be required for recruitment of SNX27 from cell lysate (Fig. 2c,
Extended Data Fig. 2). SNX27 associates with retromer via the latter’s VPS26 subunit,
and we found that VPS26 is recruited to the tail of S protein by the addition of SNX27
indicating that the tail can bind SNX27 whilst it is in a complex with retromer (Fig. 2d).
Interestingly, some tail mutants that lost SNX27 binding retained binding to retromer
indicating that this complex can also bind elsewhere in the tail.
Mutation of residues required for SNX27 or moesin binding in full length S protein did not
detectably alter its intracellular distribution or accumulation on the plasma membrane
(Extended Data Fig. 3), indicating that these interactions do not have a role in cell surface
delivery. Indeed, the binding of SNX27, although very efficient, is to the region of the tail
that will be palmitoylated in host cells and so its in vivo significance remains unclear. We

thus examined the contribution of the COPI and COPII binding sites to the subcellular
distribution of S protein. Mutation of the acidic residues in the COPII binding region
greatly reduced cell surface expression, with S protein accumulating in the ER, indicating
that these residues direct efficient egress of the newly-made S protein into the secretory
pathway (Fig. 3a-c). The COPI binding region comprises KLHYT which differs somewhat
from the canonical KXKXX or KKXX C-terminal COPI binding motif29,30. To test COPI
binding we expressed a chimeric protein comprised of the S protein tail fused to the
extracellular and TMD domains of the cell surface protein CD86. Immunoprecipitation of
this chimera from transfected cells revealed co-precipitation with COPI and this was lost
when lysine K1269 was mutated to alanine (Fig. 3d,e). When H1271 was altered to a
canonical lysine, binding was substantially increased by both co-precipitation and affinity
chromatography of cytosol, indicating that S protein has a suboptimal COPI binding site
(Fig. 3e,f). In the above alanine scanning of the tail, mutation of the terminal residue
T1273 to alanine was found to increase COPI binding (Fig. 1b), and this effect was
recapitulated with the equivalent mutation in the CD86 chimera, suggesting the Cterminal threonine is a further feature of the tail that reduces its affinity for COPI (Fig. 3e).
Extension of the tail with a C-terminal epitope tag also resulted in a loss of COPI binding
indicating that, despite containing a histidine, the C-terminus is being recognised like a
KXKXX motif that has to be at the C-terminus30. This also explains why the COPI
interaction was not detected in recent proteomic searches for interaction partners of
SARS-CoV-2 proteins as these used C-terminally tagged proteins31,32.
Incorporation of the K1269A COPI binding site mutation into full length S protein caused,
at most, only a small increase in the cell surface expression (Fig. 3g,h). In contrast, the
H1271K and T1273A mutations that increased COPI binding both caused S protein to
instead accumulate intracellularly with substantial co-localisation with the ER (Fig. 3g,h).
Thus, the COPI binding site in S has conserved features that reduce its in vivo efficacy,
and so allow it to reach the cell surface. Some other coronaviruses, including those that
have histidine at the -3 position in the tail of S, have been found to be efficiently
endocytosed if they reach the surface7,8. In these cases, endocytosis requires a tyrosinecontaining motif that resembles the classic Yxxφ signal, but the S protein of SARS-CoV-2
lacks such a motif and consistent with this we found that it not only accumulated on the
surface but did not show efficient endocytic uptake (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 3).
What might be the reason for S protein to accumulate at the cell surface? SARS-CoV-2,
like other coronaviruses, buds into intracellular membranes and so S protein that has

reached the plasma membrane will not contribute to virion formation but it is in a position
to cause infected cells to fuse to adjacent cells and so facilitate spread without virion
release. We thus tested the effect of the mutations in the COPI binding site on the degree
of cell fusion induced by S protein. 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing
S protein and mixed with Vero cells which endogenously express the S protein receptor
ACE2, and cell fusion then followed with a fluorescent assay33. The K1269A mutant that
prevents COPI binding caused a small but reproducible increase in cell fusion (Fig. 4b,c).
In contrast, the H1271K mutation that binds better to COPI resulted in greatly reduced
cell fusion, with the mutant S showing reduced levels of S1/S2 cleavage, consistent with
it not moving beyond the early Golgi (Fig. 4d).
The data presented here argue that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has three features
which facilitate accumulation on the plasma membrane. Firstly, a region containing diacidic COPII binding motifs directs efficient exit from the ER. Secondly, the COPI-binding
site is suboptimal which allows S protein to escape the Golgi apparatus. Consistent with
this, the S protein of the coronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has a
related C-terminal sequence (-KVHVQ) and was found to bind COPI with a much lower
affinity than canonical KXKXX motifs (Fig. 4a)34. Finally, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 is
not efficiently endocytosed, consistent with it lacking a tyrosine-containing motif of the
sort that is found in many coronaviruses, including PEDV, and has been shown to either
induce endocytosis or prevent movement beyond the Golgi depending on the virus (Fig.
4a) 7,8,35,36. Our data do not provide insight into possible roles for the other interactions we
have observed, and progress may require testing in different cells or in conditions of virus
replication. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that FERM domain proteins anchor cell surface
proteins to the actin cytoskeleton and thus direct their accumulation at specific regions37.
Once at the cell surface, S protein is able to induce cell fusion and hence the formation of
multinucleate syncytia. For other coronaviruses, including SARS, it is known that in virusinfected cells the M protein holds some S protein in the Golgi so as to direct its packaging
in virions13,22,38. However, this does not preclude some S reaching the surface. Indeed,
syncytia have been observed in cultured airway epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2
in vitro, and in post mortem samples of patients who have died of COVID-199,10,39. Thus, it
is clear that some SARS-CoV-2 S can reach the surface during an infection. Our analysis
of the tail of S protein suggests that this is not simply an irrelevant side reaction of virion
production but rather a feature of S that is a consequence of the sequence of its
cytoplasmic tail. Like other viruses, syncytium formation may be advantageous to SARS-

CoV-2 by allowing rapid and efficient spread between cells that is both rapid and can also
evade immune surveillance40. Indeed, it has been argued that syncytia formation may be
a common infection strategy amongst respiratory viruses41. It also seems quite
conceivable that the formation of large syncytia increases viral pathogenicity by
destablising airway epithelia or creating holes that are more challenging to repair than the
loss of single infected cell.
Our findings thus argue that syncytia formation by SARS-CoV-2 should be viewed as a
potential target for therapeutic strategies, especially as the process appears entirely
dependent on the cell surface protease TMPRSS2 to make the activating S2’ cleavage,
whereas viral entry can be facilitated by either TMPRSS2 or lysosomal cathepsins1,9.

Methods
Plasmids. Details of the plasmids used in this report can be accessed from
Supplementary Table 2. Constructs used for bacterial expression of the cytoplasmic
domains of the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2: the sequence encoding the N-terminally
GST-tagged cytoplasmic domain of S were cloned into the vector pGEX6p2 (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences). For GST-S (1255-1273, pJC149) and GST-S (1237-1273,
pJC150), the inserts and vector were amplified by PCR and assembled using Gibson
cloning with the linker SDLEVLFQGPLGSPGIQ. For GST-S (1237-1254, pJC247) in
pGEX6p2, sequence specific primers were annealed and inserted at the EcoRI and
BamHI sites with the linker SDLEVLFQGPLGSPGIQ. For the alanine mutants of GST-S
(pJC173 to pJC190, and pJC254 to pJC257) two fragments of pJC150 were amplified by
PCR using mutation specific primers and assembled by Gibson cloning. gBlocks and
PCR amplified vector were assembled by Gibson cloning. GST-S construct expressing
the cytoplasmic domain of SARS-CoV (1219-1255) was generated by mutating GST-S
from SARS-CoV-2: two fragments of pJC150 were amplified by PCR using mutation
specific primers and assembled by Gibson cloning.
Constructs used for bacterial expression of the described S protein interactors: full
length human WIPI3 (NCBI: NM_019613.4, UniProt Q5MNZ6) in pOPT vector (from O.
Perisic, MRC-LMB) with a C-terminal PGAGA linker and a 6xHis tag was generated
through Gibson assembly of the PCR amplified insert (pJC248 was the template) and
vector. Human moesin (1-300)-6xHis (UniProt P26038), and human SNX27-6xHis (528
amino acid version UniProt Q96L92-3) were cloned into pOPT vector with a C-terminal
PGAGA linker and a 6xHis tag. Inserts were synthesised as gene fragments (IDT for
moesin [1-300] and Genewiz for SNX27) with codons optimized for E. coli expression.
gBlocks and PCR amplified vectors were assembled by Gibson cloning.
WIPI3-HA construct used for expression in mammalian cells (pJC248): a gBlock
(IDT) encoding WIPI3-HA was assembled by Gibson cloning with PCR amplified
pcDNA3.1+ (Clontech). ss-HA-CPD in pEGFP_N1 (pJC338): signal sequence (1-31) with
the HA tag in the reverse primer, carboxypeptidase D (CPD) (32-1380) and vector were
PCR amplified and the three fragments were assembled by Gibson cloning. CPD cDNA
was from GenScript clone ID OHu10876, accession number NM_001304.4.
Full length S protein constructs used for expression in mammalian cells: a
sequence encoding SARS-CoV-2 S was codon optimised for expression in mammalian
cells and cloned into pcDNA3.1+ (modified to be compatible with the PiggyBac
transposase system) using the restriction sites NheI and NotI. Where indicated, an HA

tag was inserted after the signal peptide by introduction into the forward primer,
amplification by PCR and insertion into pcDNA3.1+. Key residues in the cytoplasmic tail
of S were mutated as indicated by introducing mutations into primers, amplification of a
small region at the 3’ end of the gene and insertion using the restriction sites BstEII and
NotI. For GFP-CD86 chimeric fusions, GFP and a GAGAGS linker was inserted
immediately downstream of the signal peptide of CD86 (the cDNA from John James)
using Gibson assembly and inserted into modified pcDNA3.1+ using the restriction sites
NheI and NotI. DNA fragments containing a short luminal region of CD86 (with a
membrane-proximal insertion of two aspartic acid residues) and the TMD of CD86 fused
to different mutant forms of the cytoplasmic tail of S were either synthesised (Genewiz) or
amplified by PCR. The short fragments were cloned into the GFP-CD86 vector using the
restriction sites BbvCI and NotI. GFP, with a short C-terminal linker, was cloned into
pcDNA3.1+ using the restriction sites NheI and NotI.
Mammalian cell culture. Human embryonic kidney 293T (ATCC, CRL-3216), U2OS
(ATCC, HTB-96) and Vero (ATCC, CCL-81) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium Glutamax (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(FCS) and penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO2. Unless indicated otherwise, cells
were transfected using polyethylenimine (PEI; Polyscience, 24765) dissolved in PBS to 1
mg/mL. The ratio of PEI (µL) to DNA (µg) used was 3:1; PEI was dissolved in Opti-Mem,
incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes, DNA was added and incubated for another
15 to 20 minutes at room temperature before dropwise addition onto cells which had
been seeded the day before. Cells were free of mycoplasma as determined by regular
testing (MycoAlert, Lonza).
Protein expression in bacteria. GST (pGEX6p2 vector), the different versions of the
GST-S, E and M constructs and the 6xHis-tagged interactors were expressed as follows:
plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Agilent, 230245).
From an overnight starter culture, cells were grown in 2xTY medium containing 100
µg/mL ampicillin (or 50 µg/mL Kanamycin for 6xHis-VPS26) and 34 µg/mL
chloramphenicol at 37ºC in a shaking incubator. When the culture reached OD600 = 0.6 0.8, the temperature was lowered to 16ºC, protein expression was induced with 100 µM
of Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and incubated overnight. Bacteria cells
were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 x g at 4°C for 15 minutes and were
mechanically resuspended on ice in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, and supplemented with

protease inhibitor cocktail (cOmplete, Roche). Cells were lysed by sonication and the
lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 x g at 4ºC for 15 minutes. Clarified
lysates were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed as needed for the binding assays.
GST-pulldowns using 293T cell lysates. Pull downs for mass spectrometry: clarified
lysates from 450 mL 2xTY cultures containing bacteria expressing recombinant GST,
GST-S tails (product of pJC149, pJC150, pJC247) were thawed. 100 μL of glutathione
Sepharose 4B bead slurry (GE17-0756-01) was washed twice with lysis buffer (50 mM
Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100) by
centrifugation at 100 x g for 1 minute at 4ºC and aspiration of the washing buffer. Clarified
bacterial lysates were added to the Glutathione Sepharose beads and incubated at 4ºC
for 1 hour on a tube roller. 293T cells (from four confluent T175 flasks per GST-tagged
bait) were collected by scraping and lysed with lysis buffer supplemented with protease
inhibitor cocktail (EDTA-free, cOmplete, Roche). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation
for 5 minutes at 17,000 x g and pre-cleared with 100 μL of Glutathione Sepharose bead
slurry per bait. Beads loaded with recombinant GST-tagged baits were washed once with
ice-cold lysis buffer, once with lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mM NaCl, and once
again with lysis buffer. Around 5% of the beads were kept aside as an input control and
the remaining beads were incubated with the pre-cleared 293T cell lysate for 2-4 hours
on a tube roller at 4ºC. Beads were washed twice with lysis buffer, transferred to 0.8 mL
centrifuge columns (Pierce 89869B) and washed twice more. Columns were brought to
room temperature and eluted 5 times with 100 µL of elution buffer (1.5 M NaCl in lysis
buffer) by centrifugation at 100 x g for 1 minute; for the final elution the sample was
centrifuged at 17,000 x g for 1 minute. Eluates were pooled together and concentrated
down to around 75 μL using an Amicon Ultra 0.5 mL 3,000 NMWL centrifugal filter
(Millipore UFC500324), supplemented with 25 µL of NuPage 4x LDS sample buffer
(Invitrogen, NP0007) containing 100 mM DTT. 40% of the eluate was loaded on SDS
PAGE gels (Invitrogen, XP04202) and stained with InstantBlue Coomassie Protein Stain
(Abcam, ab119211). Each lane was cut into 8 gel slices for mass spectrometry analysis.
Pulldowns for western blotting: pulldowns were conducted as described for mass
spectrometry with the exception that half of the amounts of clarified bacterial lysate,
Glutathione Sepharose beads, and clarified 293T cell lysate were used. The amounts of
eluates indicated on the figures were loaded on to SDS PAGE gels (Invitrogen,

from half of a T175 flask were used.
Mass spectrometry. Polyacrylamide gel slices (1-2 mm) were placed in a well of a 96well microtitre plate and destained with 50% v/v acetonitrile and 50 mM ammonium
bicarbonate, reduced with 10 mM DTT, and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide. After
alkylation, proteins were digested with 6 ng/µL trypsin (Promega, UK) overnight at 37 °C.
The resulting peptides were extracted in 2% v/v formic acid, 2% v/v acetonitrile. The
digests were analysed by nano-scale capillary LC-MS/MS using an Ultimate U3000
HPLC (ThermoScientific Dionex, San Jose, USA) to deliver a flow of approximately 300

60-minute gradient of acetonitrile (2% to 80%). The analytical column outlet was directly
interfaced via a nano-flow electrospray ionisation source, with a quadrupole Orbitrap
mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive HFX, ThermoScientific, USA). MS data were acquired in
data-dependent mode using a top 10 method, where ions with a precursor charge state of
1+ were excluded. High-resolution full scans (R=60,000, m/z 300-1800) were recorded in
the Orbitrap followed by higher energy collision dissociation (HCD) (26 % Normalized
Collision Energy) of the 10 most intense MS peaks. The fragment ion spectra were
acquired at a resolution of 15,000 and dynamic exclusion window of 20s was applied.
Raw data files from LC-MS/MS data were were processed using Proteome Discoverer
v2.1 (Thermo Scientific), and then searched against a human protein database (UniProt
KB, reviewed) using the Mascot search engine programme (Matrix Science, UK).
Database search parameters were set with a precursor tolerance of 10 ppm and a
fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.2 Da. One missed enzyme cleavage was allowed and
variable modifications for oxidized methionine, carbamidomethyl cysteine, pyroglutamic
acid, phosphorylated serine, threonine and tyrosine were included. MS/MS data were
validated using the Scaffold programme (Proteome Software Inc., USA). All data were
additionally interrogated manually. The data presented was exported from Scaffold as
total spectral counts with the protein threshold was set at 80%, the minimum number of
peptides was set as 2 and the peptide threshold was set at 50%. the Lower Scoring
Matches, and those of <5% probability were not shown.

with the Andromeda search engine integrated into the MaxQuant software suite43,44.
Enzyme search specificity was Trypsin/P for both endoproteinases. Up to two missed
cleavages for each peptide were allowed. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as
fixed modification with oxidized methionine and protein N-acetylation considered as
variable modifications. The search was performed with an initial mass tolerance of 6 ppm
for the precursor ion and 0.5 Da for MS/MS spectra. The false discovery rate was fixed at
1% at the peptide and protein level. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Perseus
module of MaxQuant45. Prior to statistical analysis, peptides mapped to known
contaminants, reverse hits and protein groups only identified by site were removed. Only
protein groups identified with at least two peptides, one of which was unique and two
quantitation events were considered for data analysis. Each protein had to be detected in
at least two out of the three replicates. Missing values were imputed by values simulating
noise using the Perseus default settings. To calculate the p-values, two sample t-tests
was performed.
Immunoblotting. Protein samples in 1x NuPage LDS sample buffer, 25 mM DTT (or 50
mM TCEP pH 7.0) were loaded on to SDS PAGE gels (Invitrogen, XP04205) and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) milk in
PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% [v/v] Tween-20) for 1 hour, incubated overnight at 4°C with
primary antibody in the same blocking solution, washed three times with PBS-T for 5
minutes, incubated with HRP- or Alexa Fluor (AF)-conjugated secondary antibody (where
indicated) in 0.1% (w/v) milk in PBS-T for 1 hour and, washed three times with PBS-T for
5 minutes. Where indicated a primary anti-6xHis or anti-SNX27 antibody crosslinked to
HRP was used. Blots stained with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were imaged
using BioRad ChemiDoc imagers with chemiluminescence substrates: either SuperSignal
West Pico PLUS (Thermo Scientific, 34577) or SuperSignal West Femto (Thermo
Scientific, 34095) depending on the strength of the signal. Blots stained with AFconjugated secondary antibodies were imaged using a Typhoon Imager (GE Healthcare)
or a BioRad ChemiDoc. Primary and secondary antibodies are in Supplementary Table 2.
In vitro binding assays using recombinant proteins. Saturating amounts of clarified
bacterial lysates containing GST and GST-S fusions were added to Glutathione
Sepharose beads that were previously washed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150
mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100) and incubated at 4ºC
for 1 hour on a tube roller. Beads were washed once with lysis buffer, once with lysis
buffer supplemented with 500 mM NaCl, once again with lysis buffer, and incubated with

clarified bacterial lysates containing recombinant WIPI3-6xHis, moesin(1-300)-6xHis,
SNX27-6xHis, or 6xHis-VPS26 for 2 hours at 4ºC on a rotator. Beads were washed 3
times with lysis buffer and eluted with 25 mM reduced glutathione made in lysis buffer,
supplemented with a 4x solution of NuPage LDS sample buffer containing 100 mM DTT
and loaded on SDS PAGE gels (Invitrogen, XP04205) and analysed by Coomassie
protein stain (Abcam, ab119211) or by immunoblot using an anti-6xHis HRP-conjugated
antibody.
GFP co-immunoprecipitation. 293T cells were seeded in 150 mm dishes in culture
medium in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2. Once cells reached a density of
approximately 50-70%, they were transfected with 25 μg per plate of plasmid DNA
encoding GFP or GFP-CD86-S chimeric fusions using PEI. 48 hours after transfection,
cells were mechanically resuspended in culture medium and EDTA solution and
centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C. Cells were washed once with ice cold PBS by
resuspension and centrifugation and the pellet was subsequently resuspended in 1 ml of
ice cold lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1%
Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF (Sigma) and 1x cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor
cocktail. Cells were subject to sonication using a Misonix 300 water sonicator for 1
minute; 10 seconds on, 10 seconds off at amplitude 5. Cells were incubated at 4°C with
agitation for 10 minutes prior to the clarification of the lysate at 16,100 x g for 10 minutes
at 4°C. For the sample containing the ss-GFP-CD86-S-HA chimeric fusion, 0.6 μg of antiHA antibody (Roche) was added to the lysate. A fraction of the input lysate was mixed
with 1x NuPage LDS sample buffer, 50 mM TCEP pH 7.0. 100 μl of GFP-Trap magnetic
agarose bead slurry (Chromotek) per sample was equilibrated by washing once in ice
cold lysis buffer using a magnetic rack. The equilibrated beads were resuspended in
lysate and incubated at 4°C with agitation for 2 hours. The sample was washed 5 times in
lysis buffer using a magnetic rack and eluted in 2x LDS sample buffer with 50 mM TCEP
pH 7.0 by boiling at 90°C for 3 minutes.
Comparison of internal and external levels of S by flow cytometry. U2OS cells were
seeded at a density of 2x104 cells/cm2 in T75 flasks in culture medium in a humidified
incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2. 24 hours after seeding, cells were transfected with 15 μg
of plasmid DNA encoding different N-terminally HA-tagged S cytoplasmic tail mutants
using PEI. 24 hours after transfection, cells were washed once in EDTA solution and
dissociated from the flask in accutase (Sigma) for 2 minutes at 37°C. Cells were washed

x g for 5 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and approximately 106 cells were
resuspended in FACS buffer containing an anti-HA AF488 conjugate (1:1000, BioLegend,
901509) and an eFluor 780 fixable viability dye (Thermo Fischer Scientific, 65-0865-14).
Cells were incubated on ice, in darkness for 30 minutes. Cells were washed 3 times in
FACS buffer and incubated in Cyto-Fast Fix/Perm Buffer (BioLegend, 426803) for 20
minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed once in Cyto-Fast Wash Buffer and
incubated in Cyto-Fast Wash Buffer containing an anti-HA AF647 conjugate (1:1000,
BioLegend, 682404) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with
Cyto-Fast Wash Buffer and resuspended in FACS buffer. Cells were strained using a 100
μm filter prior to analysis on an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data was
analysed using FlowJo v10 in which singlets were gated according to forward and side
scatter profiles, dead cells were excluded using the viability dye and non-transfected cells
were excluded based on their low AF488 and 647 signals. Single colour controls were
used to conduct compensation.
Assay of endocytosis of S by flow cytometry. Cells were seeded, transfected and
resuspended as described above. The antibody uptake assay was based on the use of
quenching to distinguish internal from external material46. Approximately 106 cells were
resuspended in complete medium containing an anti-HA AF488 conjugate (1:1000) and
incubated at 37°C for 40 minutes. The cells were washed twice with ice cold FACS buffer
and incubated with an anti-AF488 antibody (1:67, A-11094, Thermo Fischer Scientific; to
quench non-internalised anti-HA AF488 conjugate), an anti-mouse AF647 antibody
(1:300, Thermo Fischer Scientific, A31571; to relabel the non-internalised anti-HA
conjugate) and an eFluor 780 fixable viability dye. Cells were washed three times in ice
cold FACS buffer, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 minutes and washed a
further two times in FACS buffer. Cells were strained and analysed as described above.
Internalised anti-HA AF488 conjugate was inaccessible to quenching and therefore any
associated AF488 signal was equated to levels of internalised S. Conversely, only antiHA AF488 conjugate at the cell surface was accessible by the anti-mouse AF647
secondary antibody and therefore any associated AF647 signal was equated to levels of
non-internalised S.
Comparison of internal and external levels of S by immunofluorescence. U2OS
cells were seeded at a density of 2x104 cells/cm2 in 6-well plates in culture medium in a

and dissociated from the flask in trypsin for 2 minutes at 37°C and seeded onto coated
microscope slides (Hendley-Essex) in culture medium in a humidified incubator at 37°C
with 5% CO2. 24 hours after seeding, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% PFA in
PBS for 20 minutes at room temperature. Cells were incubated in an anti-HA AF647
conjugate (1:1000) diluted in 20% FCS in PBS for 20 minutes in order to label HA-tagged
S at the surface of cells. Cells were washed three times in PBS and permeabilised in
10% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 minutes. Cells were subsequently washed twice in PBS
and incubated in blocking buffer (20% FCS, 1% Tween-20 in PBS) for 1 hour. Cells were
incubated with an anti-calreticulin antibody (1:200, Abcam, ab2907) diluted in blocking
buffer for 1 hour in order to counterstain the ER. Cells were washed twice in PBS,
incubated in blocking buffer for 10 minutes and washed twice again in PBS. Cells were
incubated for 1 hour in darkness with an anti-rabbit AF555 secondary antibody (1:300,
Thermo Fischer Scientific, A31572) and an anti-HA AF488 conjugate (1:1000) diluted in
blocking buffer with the latter intended to label HA-tagged S associated with intracellular
membranes (as well as available external HA-S epitopes). Cells were washed twice in
PBS, incubated in blocking buffer for 10 minutes and washed twice again in PBS. Cells
were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) prior to application of a coverslip
which was sealed using nail vanish. Slides were imaged using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal
microscope.
S protein uptake assay. U2OS cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Nterminally HA-tagged S and variants, or HA-tagged CPD, and seeded onto microscope
slides as described above. 48 hours after transfection, cells were incubated in ice cold
media and slides were placed on ice for 15 minutes. An anti-HA antibody (1:300, Roche,
3F10) diluted in ice cold media was added and cells were incubated on ice for 30
minutes. Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS and subject to a chase in which
warm media was added and cells were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37°C with
5% CO2 for 1 hour. Cells were washed, fixed and blocked with 20% FCS in PBS as
described above. Cells were incubated with an anti-rat AF647 secondary antibody (1:300,
Abcam, ab150154) diluted in 20% FCS in PBS to label non-internalised anti-HA antibody
under non-permeabilising conditions at room temperature for 20 minutes. Cells were

Cell-cell fusion assay. Acceptor and donor cells were seeded at 70% confluency in a
24-well plate 16 hours prior transfection. Donor 293T cells were co-transfected with 1.5
µg of plasmids encoding different untagged S mutants and 0.6 µg of pmCherry-N1 using
6 µL of Fugene 6 following the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). Acceptor Vero
cells were treated with CellTracker™ Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein
diacetate, Thermo Scientific) for 30 minutes. Donor cells were then detached 5 hours
post transfection, mixed together with the green-labelled acceptor cells and plated in a
12-well plate. Cell-cell fusion events was measured using an IncuCyte (Sartorious) and
determined as the proportion of merged area to green area over time. Data were
analysed using IncuCyte software and plotted with Prism 8.

(GST). Values are in Supplementary Table 1. b,c, Immunoblots of eluates from the
indicated GST-tagged S tails as prepared in (a). Coomassie blue-stained gels show the
GST-tail fusions with adjacent residues of the tail of S (residues 1237-1273) mutated to
alanine (b). The blots shown are representative from two independent experiments, and
the input lysate represents 1/100 of the material applied to the GST fusions. c, Validation
of the interactions using two distinct halves of the tail of S: the membrane proximal half
(residues 1237-1254) and the distal half (residues 1255-1273). The blots shown are
representative from three independent experiments. d, Schematic of the transmembrane
and cytoplasmic domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The residues that are critical for
binding to the different cytoplasmic factors are indicated.
Fig. 2. The tail of SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds directly to moesin, WIPI3, SNX27,
and to VPS26 via SNX27. a, Coomassie-stained gel and immunoblot against 6xHis to
test the binding of the FERM domain of moesin (residues 1-300, expressed in bacterial
lysate) to GST fusions to the tail of S. Experiment repeated twice, input 1/40 that applied
to beads. b, As in (a), beads coated with the indicated GST-fusions were incubated with
clarified bacterial lysates from cells overexpressing WIPI3-6xHis. Experiment repeated
twice, input 1/7 that applied to beads. c, Coomassie gel showing that the residues
1238ThrSerCys1240 of the tail of S are required for binding to SNX27. As in (a) except
that the lysate was from cells overexpressing SNX27-6xHis. Experiment repeated three
times, input 1/40 that applied to beads. d, Coomassie gel showing that VPS26 requires
SNX27 to bind to the tail of S protein. Same experiment as in (a) except that beads
coated with the GST-fusions were incubated with bacterial lysate from cells
overexpressing either SNX27-6xHis, 6xHis-VPS26 or both. Experiment repeated twice.

Fig. 4. SARS-CoV-2 S leakage to the plasma membrane facilitates cell-cell fusion
and the formation of syncytia. a, Comparison of the cytoplasmic tails of S proteins from
the four genera of Coronaviridae. Binding motifs for trafficking proteins are indicated:
COPI (green), COPII (blue), and clathrin adaptors (red), along with cysteine residues
(brown). Retention of S in the ER reduces its capacity to form syncytia while increased
leakage to the plasma membrane increases it. b, Representative micrographs showing
293T cells coexpressing mCherry and different full-length S variants fusing with acceptor
Vero cells stained with CellTracker Green. Cell fusion is monitored by overlap between
the green and red signal. Scale bars: 200 µm. b, Quantification of cell-cell fusion as
percentage of field showing green and red overlap area. N = 2, error bars SEM. c,
Immunoblots from 293T cells expressing the indicated full-length S variants, with the
H1271K mutation restricting the protein in the early Golgi and thus away from the site of
S1/S2 cleavage by furin.

the cell surface. a, Micrographs of U2OS cells transiently expressing variants of S or
carboxypeptidase D (CPD) (all with N-terminal HA tags), and subjected to an antibody
uptake assay. Cells were incubated with an anti-HA antibody in complete medium for 30
minutes on ice, unbound antibody washed off and cells chased for one hour in complete
medium at 37ºC. Cells were fixed and surface S was labelled using an AF647-conjugated
secondary antibody under non-permeabilising conditions. Cells were then permeabilised
and stained with an AF488-conjugated secondary antibody to label both surface and
internalised S. Scale bars:10 μm. b, Flow cytometry analysis comparing HA-tagged S and
CPD in an antibody uptake assay. Cells were stained with an anti-HA AF488 conjugate
for 30 minutes on ice, unbound antibody was washed off and cells chased for 40-minutes
at 37ºC. Cells were fixed and non-internalised anti-HA AF488 conjugated antibody was
simultaneously quenched and relabelled with AF647 by incubation with an anti-AF488
antibody and an AF647-conjugated secondary antibody respectively under nonpermeabilising conditions. Histograms represent the ratio of internalised S (AF488 signal)
to that of non-internalised S (AF647 signal), and are normalised to the mode value and
represent 5000 - 10,000 events, N = 2.
