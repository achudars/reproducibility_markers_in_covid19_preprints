ABSTRACT

2
3

Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 spreads within the respiratory tract is important to define the

4

parameters controlling the severity of COVID-19. We examined the functional and structural

5

consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a reconstituted human bronchial epithelium model.

6

SARS-CoV-2 replication caused a transient decrease in epithelial barrier function and disruption

7

of tight junctions, though viral particle crossing remained limited. Rather, SARS-CoV-2 replication

8

led to a rapid loss of the ciliary layer, characterized at the ultrastructural level by axoneme loss

9

and misorientation of remaining basal bodies. The motile cilia function was compromised, as

10

measured in a mucociliary clearance assay. Epithelial defense mechanisms, including basal cell

11

mobilization and interferon-lambda induction, ramped up only after the initiation of cilia damage.

12

Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters further demonstrated the loss of motile cilia

13

in vivo. This study identifies cilia damage as a pathogenic mechanism that could facilitate SARS-

14

CoV-2 spread to the deeper lung parenchyma.

INTRODUCTION

2

The COVID-19 pandemic remains a worldwide public health emergency. The infection caused by the severe

3

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 (Lu

4

et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b; Zhu et al., 2020b) and spread to all continents except Antartica, affecting

5

over 31 million persons and causing over 970,000 deaths as of Sept. 24, 2020 (covid19.who.int).

6
7

The respiratory syndrome COVID-19 ranges from mild upper respiratory tract infection to bilateral

8

pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure (Guan et al., 2020;

9

Huang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a). Pathological examination indicates that SARS-CoV-2 targets

10

primarily the airways and the lungs (Tian et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). Severe cases are characterized by

11

diffuse alveolar damage and formation of hyaline membranes that limit gaseous exchanges. COVID-19

12

pneumonia is associated with inflammatory infiltrates in the alveolar space and a systemic cytokine storm,

13

suggesting that an exacerbated immune response contributes to damaged lung function (Huang et al.,

14

2020; Liao et al., 2020). Induction of interferons appears limited in the more severe clinical cases, pointing

15

to an imbalance between antiviral and inflammatory cytokine responses (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Hadjadj

16

et al., 2020).

17
18

SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closely related to the original SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus, which caused an outbreak

19

of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002-2003, affecting about 8,000 patients and resulting in 774

20

reported deaths (Peiris et al., 2003; Petersen et al., 2020). Both viruses use the angiotensin converting

21

enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor, and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) as a viral entry

22

cofactor (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b). The pneumonia induced by the two coronaviruses

23

show similar features in severe cases. SARS-CoV-2 induces a mortality rate approximately ten times lower

24

than SARS-CoV-1, but shows much higher effective transmissibility, and thus represents a greater threat

25

to global health (Petersen et al., 2020). Possible reasons for the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 include

26

an active viral replication in upper airway epithelia at an early stage of infection. The number of SARS-CoV-

27

2 genomic copies in nasopharyngeal swabs is generally high at symptom onset (≥106 viral RNA copies/mL)

28

and persists for about 5 days before declining (Wolfel et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2020). This is in contrast to

29

the pattern observed for SARS-CoV-1, with viral RNA peaking about 10 days after symptom onset and

30

remaining of moderate magnitude (Peiris et al., 2003). Therefore, analyzing how SARS-CoV-2 spreads in

31

the airways is relevant to understand its pandemic potential and potentially identify novel mitigation

32

strategies.

1

The epithelium lining the airways plays a key role in the defense against infections (Tilley et al., 2015). It

2

comprises goblet cells that secrete a protective mucus able to trap inhaled particles, including microbes.

3

Ciliated cells, which constitute over half of epithelial cells, possess an apical layer of about 200 cilia that

4

beat rhythmically in a coordinated fashion, resulting in a movement of the overlaying mucus layer towards

5

the laryngopharynx, where it is ultimately swallowed (Spassky and Meunier, 2017). This mechanism of

6

mucociliary clearance prevents the accumulation of particles and mucus within the lungs. The airways

7

basal cells, located close to the epithelial basement membrane, respond to injury by proliferating and

8

differentiating into other epithelial cell types. Studies of autopsy samples from COVID-19 patients and

9

experimental infection of tissue explants have documented SARS-CoV-2 replication predominantly in the

10

upper and lower airway epithelia and in the lung alveoli (Hou et al., 2020; Hui et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020).

11

Infection of reconstituted airway epithelia showed a preferential targeting of ciliated cells, with an

12

infection of goblet cells in some (Mulay et al., 2020; Pizzorno et al., 2020; Ravindra et al., 2020; Zhu et al.,

13

2020a) but not all studies (Hou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020b). The functional consequences of SARS-CoV-

14

2 infection on epithelial functions remain to be characterized.

15
16

To better understand the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 dissemination in the respiratory tract, we analyzed

17

the ultrastructural and functional changes induced by infection in a reconstituted human bronchial

18

epithelium model. This system enabled the study of SARS-CoV-2 interactions with its primary target cells

19

in a well-differentiated pseudostratified epithelium. We also examined the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection

20

on the airway mucosa in vivo, using the physiologically relevant Syrian hamster model.

RESULTS

24
25

SARS-CoV-2 actively replicates in a reconstituted human bronchial epithelium model

26

SARS-CoV-2 infection was studied in the MucilAirTM model, consisting of primary human bronchial

27

epithelial cells grown over a porous membrane and differentiated at the air/liquid interface (ALI) for over

28

4 weeks (Fig. 1A). We first verified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that the bronchial epithelial

29

cells were differentiated into a pseudostratified epithelium comprising three main cell types (Fig. 1B):

30

ciliated cells harboring a dense layer of 5-10 µm long motile cilia, goblet cells enriched in mucus-containing

31

vesicles (arrowhead), and basal cells spread flat on the insert membrane.

1

The reconstituted epithelia were infected with a viral suspension of SARS-CoV-2 at 106 pfu/mL deposited

2

on the apical side for 4h, restored to ALI conditions, and monitored for infection for 7 days. We observed

3

a rapid increase of extracellular viral RNA in apical culture supernatants, with concentrations reaching up

4

to 106 viral RNA copies/µL at 2 days post-infection (dpi), followed by stable or slowly decreasing viral RNA

5

levels until 7 dpi (Fig. 1C). In contrast, minimal concentrations of viral RNA were detected in the basolateral

6

compartment (Fig. 1D), indicating that SARS-CoV-2 particles were predominantly released from the apical

7

side of the epithelium. Infectious viral particle production in apical supernatants initially tracked with viral

8

RNA production, with a rapid increase at 2 dpi to reach a mean of 1.8 x 106 TCID50/mL, followed by a

9

plateau at 4 dpi (Fig. 1E). A decrease to 6.1 x 104 TCID50/mL was then observed at 7 dpi, suggesting a

10

partial containment of infectious virus production. Immunofluorescence analysis of the reconstituted

11

epithelia revealed a patchy distribution of infected cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at 2 and

12

4 dpi, and minimal persistence of productively infected cells at 7 dpi, consistent with partial viral

13

containment after one week of infection (Fig. 1F).

14
15

SARS-CoV-2 infection transiently impairs epithelial barrier function

16

SARS-CoV-2 productive infection locally altered the distribution of zonula occludens protein-1 (ZO-1),

17

which associates to tight junctions. The characteristic ZO-1 staining pattern at cell boundaries remained

18

intact in mock-infected epithelia (Fig. 1F, left), but appeared disrupted in areas with viral antigen

19

expression (Fig. 1F, right), suggesting a possible impairment of epithelial barrier integrity. Image analysis

20

confirmed that the average number of neighbors per cell at 4 dpi decreased from 5.93 to 5.72 (P<0.001),

21

a value characteristic of actively remodeling epithelia (Aigouy et al., 2010; Farhadifar et al., 2007) (Fig. S1A-

22

H, J). In addition, infection induced changes in the average area of ZO-1-delimited cells, which significantly

23

increased at 2 and 4 dpi, but decreased at 7 dpi as compared to uninfected samples (Fig.S1A-I), supporting

24

a dynamic remodeling of the epithelium. The epithelial packing geometry returned to a more regular

25

pattern at 7 dpi, with a higher proportion of hexagonal cells than at 4 dpi, pointing to the restoration of

26

the tight junction network.

27
28

To test barrier function, we measured the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) between electrodes

29

placed in the apical and basal compartments of reconstituted bronchial epithelia (Fig. 1G). As expected,

30

TEER proved relatively stable in mock-treated cultures, with values remaining above 600 Ω.cm2. In SARS-

31

CoV-2 infected cultures, there was a transient but significant 3.3x TEER decrease at 4 dpi (Fig. 1H; P=0.02).

32

Apical-to-basolateral transport of FITC-coupled dextran showed an inverse relation to TEER, with a

5

1

transient 2.5x increase in paracellular permeability at 4 dpi (Fig. 1I-J; P=0.015). Both TEER and permeability

2

values returned to baseline levels at 7 dpi, demonstrating epithelial regeneration after SARS-CoV-2

3

infection.

4
5

Measurement of cell death by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in apical supernatants showed

6

an increase at 4 dpi in infected epithelia (Fig. S2A; P=0.01), confirming that SARS-CoV-2 exerted a transient

7

cytopathic effect on epithelial cells. Dying cells extruded from the apical side were observed at the surface

8

of infected epithelia, though their numbers remained limited (Fig. S2B). Extruded cells had a rounded

9

shape and sometimes carried multiple viral particles at their surface (Fig. S2C), suggesting virally-induced

10

cell death. Taken together, these findings showed that SARS-CoV-2 caused a transient loss of epithelial

11

barrier function, due to cytopathic effect and a perturbation of the tight junction network. However, SARS-

12

CoV-2 infection did not cause a general disruption of the epithelial layer and was compatible with rapid

13

epithelial regeneration.

14
15

SARS-CoV-2 infection damages the cilia layer

16

The nature of infected cells was characterized by immunofluorescence confocal imaging. At 2 dpi, the

17

majority of cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen at their surface (spike+ cells) co-expressed the

18

cilia marker b-tubulin IV, confirming that ciliated cells represented the main viral targets in this model (Fig.

19

2A). At 4 dpi, the majority of spike+ cells still expressed b-tubulin IV, though we noted the presence of

20

infected cells with weak or absent b-tubulin IV staining (Fig. 2B). Basal cells expressing the cytokeratin-5

21

marker did not appear infected, with the exception of rare cells that had lost their basal localization (Fig.

22

S3A). Of note, some spike-negative basal cells changed morphology and appeared raised through the

23

pseudo-stratified epithelium in infected samples, suggesting an epithelial response to virally-induced

24

damage (Fig. 2B). We did not detect infected cells expressing the goblet cell marker MUC5AC (Fig. S3B).

25

However, further analyses by SEM documented viral budding from cells with multiple secretory pores that

26

may represent rare infected goblet cells (Fig. S3C). Interestingly, viral production was also documented in

27

cells with a transitional phenotype characterized by the presence of both motile cilia and abundant

28

secretory vesicles (Fig. S3D). Taken together, these results showed a preferential tropism of SARS-CoV-2

29

for ciliated epithelial cells, with occasional infection of transitional and secretory cells.

30
31

As we had observed infected cells with weak b-tubulin IV staining, we asked whether SARS-CoV-2 infection

32

could perturb the layer of motile cilia present at the apical side of ciliated cells. To this goal, we quantified

6

1

the area occupied by b-tubulin IV staining (tubulin+ area) on projections of confocal images obtained

2

sequentially in the course of infection (Fig. 2C-D). The tubulin+ area remained unchanged at 2 dpi, but

3

decreased at 4 dpi (median values: 87.9% in mock, 61.7% in infected; P=0.0012), and showed only limited

4

recovery at 7 dpi (94.8 % in mock vs 67.9% in infected, P=0.0043). SEM imaging confirmed a marked cilia

5

loss at 4 dpi and showed that deciliated areas were not devoid of cells, but rather occupied by cells covered

6

by flattened microvilli (Fig. 2E).

7
8

The formation of deciliated areas could occur via the loss of motile cilia at the surface of infected cells, or

9

via the replacement of dead ciliated cells by cells involved in epithelial regeneration. To distinguish

10

between these non-exclusive possibilities, we analyzed the distribution of cilia at the early stage of

11

infection, prior to the occurrence of measurable cell death. A set of ≥70 cells was analyzed on confocal

12

images obtained at 2 dpi in each of three categories: ciliated cells from mock-infected epithelia (mock),

13

productively infected ciliated cells (spike+) and bystander uninfected ciliated cells (spike-) from SARS-CoV-

14

2 exposed epithelia. For each cell, the averaged intensity profile of b-tubulin IV staining was measured

15

along the depth axis (Fig. 3A). There was a bimodal distribution of b-tubulin in mock cells, with a distal

16

peak corresponding to cilia and a proximal peak located just below the plasma membrane, corresponding

17

to the area where basal bodies anchor cilia into the cytoplasm. Examination of average profiles for each

18

category suggested a specific decrease of the distal b-tubulin peak in spike+ cells. This was confirmed by

19

an analysis of the distal to proximal peak intensity ratio, which showed a significant decrease in spike+

20

cells, as compared to spike- and mock cells (Fig. 3B). Thus, the density of cilia decreased at 2 dpi, supporting

21

an early loss of cilia in infected cells. SEM imaging confirmed the presence of productively infected cells

22

with only few remaining cilia on their apical surface (Fig. 3C), as opposed to the packed ciliary layer

23

characteristic of intact ciliated cells (Fig. 1B). Some infected cells showed a lack of cilia and a massive

24

accumulation of virions at the cell surface and on membrane ruffles (Fig. 3D), indicative of highly

25

productive SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of note, viral particles were rarely observed along the length of ciliary

26

sheaths. This observation was consistent with the distribution of spike staining, which formed a narrow

27

band above the plasma membrane, but did not overlay the distal b-tubulin peak (Fig. 3A, spike+; Fig. S4A).

28

In addition, spike and b-tubulin labeling showed minimal colocalization, as measured by Mander

29

correlation coefficients (Fig. S4B-C). Thus, viral budding or accumulation did not take place in the cilium

30

structure, suggesting that cilia destruction occurred through an indirect mechanism.

31

SARS-CoV-2 infection induces ultrastructurally abnormal cilia

1

SEM imaging performed at higher magnification revealed ultrastructural abnormalities in infected ciliated

2

cells. Cilia were often shortened and misshapen (Fig. 4A-B) and sometimes showed crescent-shaped juxta-

3

membrane regions (Fig. 4C). Viral particles present at the membrane were not symmetrical but rather

4

pleiomorphic (Fig. 4D), consistent with studies suggesting that spike trimers adopt various orientations at

5

the virion surface (Turonova et al., 2020). Transmission electron microcopy (TEM) was then used to

6

examine the internal organization of cilia. Mock-infected epithelia revealed a typical "9+2" cilium

7

structure, with peripheral microtubule doublets surrounding a central microtubule pair (Fig. S4D). These

8

microtubules constituted elongated axonemes that emerged from basal bodies aligned perpendicular to

9

the plasma membrane (Fig. 4E). The basal bodies were themselves anchored into the cytoplasm through

10

striated rootlets (Fig. 4F). A striking disorganization of cilia structure was observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected

11

cells, with fewer axonemes, and misoriented basal bodies that lined large vesicles, which themselves often

12

contained viral-like particles (Fig. 4G and S4E). Isolated rootlets were also detected, suggesting a

13

dissociation of ciliary components (Fig. S4G). The vesicles contained packed viral-like particles, but also

14

larger particles that may have derived from engulfed basal bodies (Fig. 4H and S4E). Therefore, SARS-CoV-

15

2 infection had a major impact on ciliary structure, by inducing axoneme loss and accumulation of

16

mislocalized basal bodies.

17
18

SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs mucociliary clearance

19

We next examined the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on ciliary function. To this goal, we

20

deposited low density 30 µm-sized polystyrene microbeads onto the apical surface of mock-treated or

21

infected epithelia and tracked their movement in real time. These experiments were performed at 7 dpi,

22

to allow sufficient reconstitution of the mucus layer after the infection step. We observed that beads

23

deposited on mock-treated epithelia moved generally in the same direction, consistent with coordinated

24

beating of the underlying cilia (Fig. 5A, 5C, and Supplemental Movie 1). In contrast, beads deposited on

25

infected epithelia were mostly immobile or showed randomly-oriented limited movements, indicating an

26

impairment of the mucociliary clearance function (Fig. 5B, 5D, and Supplemental Movie 2). Quantitation

27

of velocities confirmed a highly significant decrease in bead clearance upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (mean:

28

8.9 µm/s in mock vs 1.5 µm/s in infected epithelia; P<0.0001) (Fig. 5E). The straightness of tracks also

29

decreased in infected epithelia (Fig. 5F; P<0.0001), suggesting a perturbation in the coordination of cilia

30

movements. Thus, cilia alterations induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection were associated to a marked

31

impairment in mucociliary transport.

1

Epithelial defense mechanisms are triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection

2

Mucociliary transport was altered at 7 dpi, at a time when barrier integrity was already restored (Fig. 1).

3

To better apprehend the process of epithelial regeneration, we analyzed the localization and morphology

4

of basal cells at this time point. Confocal images showed that basal cells expressing cytokeratin-5 were

5

typically flattened on the basement membrane of mock-treated epithelia, while they appeared raised

6

through the thickness of the pseudo-stratified epithelium in infected samples (Fig. 6A). To quantify this

7

phenomenon, we first generated elevation maps of the inserts that support the cultures, and used these

8

to correct for local insert deformations (Fig. S5A). This approach enabled to precisely quantify the mean

9

height of basal cells in the epithelia, which proved significantly higher in infected than non-infected

10

samples (Fig. 6B-C). SEM imaging confirmed that basal cells adopted a more rounded morphology in

11

infected epithelia (Fig. S5B). Thus, basal cells were mobilized at 7 dpi, which may contribute to the

12

restoration of barrier integrity. However, they had not differentiated into ciliary cells at this stage, as

13

attested by the persistence of deciliated areas (Fig. 2D) and the impairment in mucociliary clearance (Fig.

14

5E).

15
16

Epithelial interferon production provides another key defense mechanism, that can occur in the absence

17

of immune cell infiltration, and thus represents one of the earliest antiviral response to respiratory viruses.

18

We monitored the kinetics of type I (IFN-a, IFN-b) and type III (IFN-l) interferon production in the

19

supernatants of reconstituted epithelia. IFN-a remained undetectable (data not shown), using a high-

20

sensitivity SIMOA assay with a limit of detection (LOD) of 2 fg/mL (Hadjadj et al., 2020). IFN-b was

21

minimally induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, with peak values of 4.2±0.4 pg/mL at 2 dpi in apical

22

supernatants, and levels below the LOD (< 1.7 pg/mL) in basal supernatants (Fig. 6D, left). In contrast, IFN-

23

l induction showed a different kinetics, with limited induction in apical supernatants at 2 dpi, but

24

persistent increase at 4 and 7 dpi, to reach relatively high concentrations in both the apical (501.3±81.8

25

pg/mL) and basal supernatants (343±106 pg/mL) (Fig. 6D, right). Both IFN-b and IFN-l production showed

26

a degree of inter-sample variability, but were significantly induced as compared to mock-treated samples

27

at 4 dpi (Fig. 6E). It remained striking, however, that viral replication already peaked at 2 dpi (Fig. 1E), while

28

interferon production was minimal at this stage. Pretreatment of the reconstituted epithelia with

29

exogenous IFN-b or IFN-l prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased viral RNA levels by 2 logs (Fig. 6F),

30

pointing to the importance of the timing of IFN induction to achieve viral containment. Taken together,

31

these findings documented the induction of epithelial defense mechanisms following SARS-CoV-2

infection, including basal cell mobilization and type III interferon induction. However, the kinetics of these

2

responses appeared too slow in this model to prevent viral replication and functional impairment.

SARS-CoV-2 infection damages the ciliary layer in the respiratory tract of Syrian hamsters

5

We next asked whether the ciliated airway epithelium is impacted by SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. We

6

chose the golden Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) model, as this species is naturally susceptible to

7

SARS-CoV-2 and shows lung lesions upon infection (Chan et al., 2020; Sia et al., 2020). Syrian hamsters

8

were infected with 6 x 104 pfu of SARS-CoV-2 via the intranasal route. The infected hamsters showed rapid

9

body weight loss as compared to mock-infected controls (n=4 in each group; Fig. 7A). The animals were

euthanized at 4 dpi, at a time when the infected group showed a high viral load in the trachea (Fig. 7B).

11

SEM imaging showed that cilia occupied almost half of the epithelial surface in the trachea of control

12

animals (Fig. 7C, left). A marked cilia loss occurred in the trachea of infected animals (Fig. 7C, right), as

13

confirmed by image analysis (median of ciliated area: 2.5% in SARS-CoV-2+ vs 45.4% in Mock, P=0.0079)

14

(Fig. 7D). Immunofluorescence labeling of trachea sections confirmed a partial to complete loss of the

15

ciliated layer at 4 dpi, with a mobilization of basal cells towards the luminal side of the epithelium (Fig. 7E).

16

The SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen could be detected in a few remaining ciliated cells (Fig. S6). Therefore, SARS-

17

CoV-2 infected and damaged the epithelial ciliary layer in a physiologically relevant animal model.

DISCUSSION

21

We report here that SARS-CoV-2 preferentially replicates in ciliated cells, damages the ciliary layer, and

22

impairs mucociliary clearance in a reconstituted human bronchial epithelium model. We also

23

demonstrate, in the SARS-CoV-2 susceptible hamster model, a loss of motile cilia in the trachea of infected

24

animals. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 specifically damaged airway motile cilia, both in vivo and in vitro. Our findings

25

suggest that cilia loss may also play a role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, as a localized clearance impairment

26

at the site of SARS-CoV-2 replication could facilitate viral spread within the airways. Decreased cilia

27

movement could slow the transport of released virions towards the pharynx and facilitate viral access to

28

deeper regions of the bronchial tree. This process could self-perpetuate, with cycles of localized cilia

29

destruction facilitating SARS-CoV-2 progression towards increasingly more distal regions, until the virus

30

reaches the alveoli and triggers pneumocyte damage.

We did not observe major discontinuities in the tracheal epithelium of infected hamsters. Continuity of

2

the epithelial layer was not disrupted in the in vitro model either, as confirmed by the minimal release of

3

viral particles in the basal compartment. A degree of cytotoxicity was measured by LDH release, but the

4

observation of extruded dead cells remained occasional. Epithelial barrier function was impaired at day 4,

5

as documented by decreased transepithelial resistance, increased permeability, and altered distribution

6

of the tight junction protein ZO-1. However, this functional impairment remained transient, with signs of

7

epithelial regeneration such as basal cell mobilization observed at day 7. Our results indicate that SARS-

8

CoV-2 replication has a drastic effect on the ciliary layer while exerting a moderate effect on epithelial

9

barrier integrity. This is in contrast to other respiratory viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV), which

10

induces widespread epithelial cell death and persistent loss of epithelial barrier function (Essaidi-Laziosi et

11

al., 2018). Respiratory viruses use distinct strategies that all converge in limiting mucociliary clearance,

12

including motile cilia loss (this study)(Look et al., 2001), epithelial disruption (Essaidi-Laziosi et al., 2018;

13

Villenave et al., 2010), and altered ciliary movements (Essaidi-Laziosi et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2014).

14

Experimental impairment of ciliary movements through chemical treatment also increased IAV infection

15

in vitro (Fu et al., 2018), providing further evidence that decreasing mucociliary clearance can facilitate

16

viral infection.

17
18

The role of mucociliary clearance in limiting respiratory bacterial infections is also well documented (Gudis

19

et al., 2012), and supported by the recurrence of severe pulmonary infections in patients with inborn

20

errors in genes essential to motile cilia function (Shapiro et al., 2016). The percentage of COVID-19 patients

21

presenting with a bacterial or fungal respiratory co-infection at hospital admission remains moderate

22

(Garcia-Vidal et al., 2020; Rawson et al., 2020). However, the occurrence of secondary infections increases

23

in critically-ill COVID-19 patients, in spite of common broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis. One fourth

24

to one third of severe COVID-19 patients experience secondary bacterial or fungal superinfections (Alanio

25

et al., 2020; Manohar et al., 2020; White et al., 2020). Secondary infections are associated with worse

26

outcomes (Garcia-Vidal et al., 2020; Manohar et al., 2020), emphasizing the possible effect of impaired

27

mucociliary clearance on the risk of severe COVID.

28
29

Ultrastructural analysis by SEM revealed a loss of motile cilia in productively infected human bronchial

30

cells. Misshapen and shortened cilia were also detected, reminiscent of abnormalities observed in certain

31

cases of primary ciliopathies (Shah et al., 2008; Tilley et al., 2015). We documented by

32

immunofluorescence a thinning of the ciliary layer as early as 2 dpi, associated to a layer of viral spike

protein at the base of motile cilia. SARS-CoV-2 particles did not bud from cilia, but rather from deciliated

2

areas, as indicated by the minimal colocalization between the spike and b-tubulin markers. Clusters of viral

3

particles could be detected on microvilli, consistent with findings suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could induce

4

the formation of actin-based filaments in transformed cells (Bouhaddou et al., 2020). The absence of viral

5

particles within cilia may result from the restricted protein access imposed by the transition zone at the

6

base of motile cilia (Nachury and Mick, 2019). Access of cellular proteins into the ciliary axoneme is limited

7

to those bound by the intraflagellar transport machinery, which likely prevents the import of viral proteins.

8

Therefore, the destruction of motile cilia by SARS-CoV-2 seems mediated by an indirect mechanism, rather

9

than by direct viral production within these structures. TEM imaging revealed the presence of misoriented

10

basal bodies that had lost plasma membrane docking in productively infected cells. The ciliary axoneme is

11

normally

12

polymerization/depolymerization, in turn regulated by the supply of ciliary components by intraflagellar

13

transport (Lechtreck et al., 2017). Our observations in infected cells suggest a disequilibrium favoring

14

depolymerization, leading to loss of ciliary axonemes. Rootlets, which normally anchor basal bodies into

15

the cytoplasm, were sometimes found isolated, suggesting that basal bodies may themselves detach

16

and/or depolymerize. It is relevant that RNAseq studies of SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cell cultures

17

(Nunnari et al., 2020; Ravindra et al., 2020) and of mucosal samples from COVID-19 patients (He et al.,

18

2020) reported a downregulation of transcripts involved in cilia function, such as dyneins, supporting the

19

idea of a virally-induced dedifferentiation of ciliated cells. Future work will help decipher the step at which

20

SARS-CoV-2 impairs the production, stability, or transport of ciliary components.

SARS-CoV-2 infection also induced a significant IFN response, that was primarily driven by type III IFN. IFN-

23

l was abundantly secreted at 4 dpi in the apical and basal compartments of infected reconstituted

24

epithelia. In contrast, IFN-b secretion was minimal in the apical compartment and undetectable in the

25

basal compartment. IFN-a secretion remained undetectable in both compartments, even though we used

26

a high-sensitivity Simoa digital ELISA for detection. These observations fit with the notion that type III IFN

27

is the dominant antiviral cytokine in epithelia, enabling a localized response mediated directly by epithelial

28

cells, prior to the infiltration of immune cells (Park and Iwasaki, 2020). It was noteworthy, however, that

29

IFN was secreted mostly from day 4 post-infection onward, while viral RNA production had already shown

30

a 2 log increase by day 2. This delay in the induction of the antiviral response suggests a "too little too late"

31

scenario, where antiviral mechanisms are overwhelmed and subverted by active viral replication. Our

32

findings are compatible with studies showing a limited and/or delayed IFN induction by SARS-CoV-2 as

(Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Lamers et al., 2020; V’kovski et al., 2020; Vanderheiden et al., 2020).

4

These results do not rule out the potential for IFN treatment, as IFN may still exert an antiviral effect if

5

administered early. We observed that pretreatment with IFN-b or IFN-l markedly decreased SARS-CoV-2

6

replication in our reconstituted bronchial epithelium model. These findings are in agreement with studies

7

in various culture systems documenting the inhibitory effect of both type I and type III IFN on SARS-CoV-2

8

replication, when treatment occurs prior to the stage of massive viral replication (Felgenhauer et al., 2020;

9

Mantlo et al., 2020; Stanifer et al., 2020; V’kovski et al., 2020; Vanderheiden et al., 2020). However, studies

10

in animal models suggest that, at an advanced stage of infection, IFN may contribute to the decline of

11

respiratory function, possibly by worsening inflammation (Boudewijns et al., 2020) and impairing epithelial

12

cell regeneration (Broggi et al., 2020; Major et al., 2020). Therefore, the window of opportunity for IFN

13

treatment may have to be carefully defined in randomized controlled trials.

14
15

In conclusion, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 induces a rapid loss of the ciliary layer in airway epithelial

16

cells, resulting in impaired mucociliary clearance. Infected cells display ultrastructurally altered motile cilia,

17

characterized by misshapen or absent axonemes. Intrinsic epithelial defense mechanisms likely occur too

18

late to prevent cilia loss. These findings highlight a pathogenic mechanism that may promote viral spread

19

in the respiratory tree and increase the risk of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients.
