Abstract
Global surveillance has identified emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) associated
with broadened host specificity, pathogenicity, and immune evasion to vaccine induced immunity.
Here we compared humoral and cellular responses against SARS-CoV-2 VOC in subjects
immunized with the DNA vaccine, INO-4800. INO-4800 vaccination induced neutralizing
antibodies against all variants tested, with reduced levels detected against B.1.351. IFNγ T cell
responses were fully maintained against all variants tested.

Main Text
SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, continues to cause unprecedented
levels of mortality and socioeconomic burden. Concerningly, virus surveillance shows the global
spread of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, which are more infectious and display increased
transmissibility and pathology [1-3]. Some of these variants of concern (VOC) contain mutations
in the Spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), the region which interacts with the host ACE2
receptor, and to which many SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies target. The B.1.1.7 lineage, the
first emerging VOC reported in the United Kingdom, contains the key N501Y and D614G
mutations and the 69-70 deletion in the RBD and/or S1 regions and exhibits increased
transmissibility which is associated with increased pathogenesis, but does not appear to
significantly evade neutralizing antibody responses generated by current vaccines approved for
use [4, 5]. The B.1.351 (first reported in South Africa) and P.1 (first reported in Brazil) lineages
have additional mutations, including E484K in the RBD region [6-8], as well as unique changes
in position K417. Notably, sera isolated from convalescent individuals and vaccinees exposed to
the wild-type (WT) Spike protein sequence have shown significantly lower levels of neutralizing
activity against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants [8-12].
INO-4800 is a SARS-CoV-2 Spike DNA-based vaccine that is delivered intradermally followed by
electroporation (EP) using CELLECTRA® 2000 and is currently undergoing clinical development.
In a Phase 1 clinical trial, INO-4800 vaccination induced a balanced immune response
characterized by both functional antibody and T cell responses in vaccinated subjects [13]. Both
humoral and cellular immune responses have been shown to be important components of
protection against betacoronaviruses [14-16]. In the present study, we have assessed the
humoral and T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants elicited
after INO-4800 vaccination (Figure S1A).
In INO-4800 vaccinated subjects, serum IgG antibody binding titers to SARS-CoV-2 full-length
Spike proteins were evaluated by ELISA using proteins specific for B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1
variants (Fig. 1A, and S1A). IgG binding titers were not negatively impacted between WT and
B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 variants. An average 1.9-fold reduction was observed for the P.1 variant in
subjects tested at week 8 after receiving two doses of INO-4800 (Fig. 1A).
We performed a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay using sera collected from thirteen
subjects two weeks after administration of a third dose of either 0.5 mg, 1 mg, or 2 mg of INO4800 (Table S1). Neutralizing activity was detected against WT and the emerging variants in all
serum samples tested (Fig. 1B). The mean ID50 titers for the WT, B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1. were
643, 295, 105, and 664, respectively (Table S1). Compared to WT, there was a 2.1 and 6.9-fold
reduction for B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, respectively, while there was no difference between WT and
the P.1 variant. These results are consistent with other recent studies, which have demonstrated

a significant reduction in neutralizing activity in vaccinated individuals towards the B.1.351 (≥6fold reduction), while the B.1.1.7 lineage has demonstrated a reduced activity of 2-fold or less [4,
7-9, 17]. Strikingly, while the P.1 strain presents with similar RBD mutations as B.1.351, we did
not observe any reduction in neutralizing activity compared to the WT strain in INO-4800
vaccinated individuals [18, 19]. The P.1 lineage has similar changes in the RBD to the B.1.351
lineage as they contain the N501Y mutation found in the B.1.1.7 lineage and identical E484K
mutations. However, they have similar but different mutations at position K417, with a change to
T for the P.1 and to N for the B.1.351 lineage. While both are changes to polar uncharged side
chains, the B1.351 N mutation carries an additional amide group. It is possible that this position
and this change allows for the impact of neutralizing responses observed.
Recent reports have supported an important role for T cell immunity in protecting against COVID19 in the absence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 [20, 21]. Through optimized DNA construct
design, combined with intradermal enhanced delivery, Inovio’s DNA platform technology has been
demonstrated to drive balanced humoral and cellular immune responses to a wide range of
infectious disease and tumor antigen targets [22-24]. We therefore compared cellular immune
responses to WT and SARS-CoV-2 Spike variants elicited by INO-4800 vaccination. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from ten subjects at week 8 after receiving their
second dose of INO-4800 were stimulated with WT, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, or P.1 Spike peptides and
cellular responses were measured by IFNγ ELISpot assay. We observed strikingly similar cellular
responses to WT (median = 82.2 IFNγ spot-forming units [SFUs]/106 PBMCs, IQR = 58.9-205.3),
B.1.1.7 (median = 79.4, IQR = 38.9- 179.7), B.1.351 (median = 80.0, IQR = 40.0-208.6) and P.1
(median = 78.3, IQR = 53.1-177.8) Spike peptides (Fig. 2). This is consistent with published
results showing that, compared with neutralizing antibody responses, cellular immunity is
relatively unimpaired by the current variants of concern [25]. Here, we show that T cell responses
are consistently maintained between WT and all SARS-CoV-2 variants tested, including B.1.351
and P.1. Cells stimulated with peptides against these variants generated IFNγ responses as well
as cytokines associated with CD8+ cytotoxic T cell responses (data not shown).
There is a growing concern regarding the protective efficacy of vaccines recently approved for
emergency use and those vaccines currently in development against the variants of concern.
Recent studies have shown a reduction in serum neutralization levels against B.1.351 and P.1 [4,
7, 18], with minimal impact against B.1.1.7 [17]. In addition, vaccine trials have shown a
considerable reduction in protective efficacy against B.1.351 [11, 12, 26]. Interestingly, a small
reduction in protective efficacy is observed in Latin American countries including Brazil,
suggesting that P.1 may have emerged around the time of clinical trials were in effect [26]. Here
we report the neutralizing antibody and T cell activity measured in INO-4800 vaccinated subjects
against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and
Brazil. The neutralization levels against B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 for the INO-4800 SARS-CoV-2 Spike
DNA vaccine are consistent with previous reports of subjects receiving vaccines encoding for the
ancestral Spike protein [7, 27]. Surprisingly, despite recent reports showing a reduction in
neutralizing activity against the P.1 variant [8, 18], INO-4800 generates robust neutralizing
antibodies at levels comparable to the WT strain. INO-4800 induces cross-reactive T cell
responses against B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants that are comparable to the WT strain. Taken
together, these data demonstrate maintenance of one or both cellular and humoral arms of the
immune response against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants for the INO-4800 vaccine, which will
likely be critical factors to impact the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods
Clinical Trial Subject Samples: Serum and PBMC samples were acquired from participants of
the phase I INO-4800 clinical trial (NCT04336410) described previously [13]. The trial has since
been expanded to include participants of 51-64 and 64+ years of age as separate groups in
addition to the original 18-50 age group. A 0.5 mg dose group was also added. Sera from 20
subjects out of the 120 total study participants were selected for analysis on variant Spike protein
binding ELISAs and variant pseudovirus neutralization assays. The samples analyzed by
pseudovirus neutralization assay were collected from subjects two weeks after a third dose of
INO-4800, and the samples used for other ELISA and ELISpot were collected after two doses.
Antigen Binding ELISA: Binding ELISAs were performed as described previously[13], except
different variants of SARS-CoV-2 S1+S2 proteins were used for plate coating. The S1+S2 wildtype Spike protein (Acro Biosystems #SPN-C52H8) contained amino acids 16-1213 of the full
Spike protein (Accession #QHD43416.1) with R683A and R685A mutations to eliminate the furin
cleavage site. The B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 S1+S2 variant proteins (Acro Biosystems #SPNC52Hc,#SPN-C52H6, and #SPN-C52Hg, respectively) additionally contained the following
proline substitutions for trimeric protein stabilization: F817P, A892P, A899P, A942P, K986P, and
V987P. The B.1.1.7 protein contained the following variant-specific amino acid substitutions:
HV69-70del, Y144del, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H; the B.1.351
protein contained the following substitutions: L18F, D80A, D215G, R246I, K417N, E484K, N501Y,
D614G, A701V; and the P.1 protein contained the following: L18F,T20N,P26S,
D138Y,R190S,K417T,E484K,N501Y,D614G,H655Y,T1027I,V1176F. Assay plates were coated
using 100 µL of 2 µg/mL of protein.
SARS-CoV-2 Pseudovirus Production: SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus stocks encoding for the WT,
B.1.1.7, B.1.351 or P.1 Spike protein were produced using HEK 293T cells transfected with
Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher) using IgE-SARS-CoV-2 S plasmid variants (Genscript) cotransfected with pNL4-3.Luc.R-E- plasmid (NIH AIDS reagent) at a 1:8 ratio. 72h post transfection,
supernatants were collected, steri-filtered (Millipore Sigma), and aliquoted for storage at -80°C.

SARS-CoV-2 Pseudoviral Neutralization Assay: CHO cells stably expressing ACE2 (ACE2CHOs) were used as target cells plated at 10,000 cells/well. SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus were
tittered to yield greater than 30 times the cells only control relative luminescence units (RLU) after
72h of infection. Sera from 13 INO-4800 vaccinated subjects were heat inactivated and serially
diluted two-fold starting at 1:16 dilution. Sera were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus for
90 min at room temperature. After incubation, sera-pseudovirus mixture was added to ACE2CHOs and allowed to incubate in a standard incubator (37% humidity, 5% CO2) for 72h. After
72h, cells were lysed using Bright-Glo™ Luciferase Assay (Promega) and RLU was measured
using an automated luminometer. Neutralization titers (ID50) were calculated using GraphPad
Prism 8 and defined as the reciprocal serum dilution at which RLU were reduced by 50%
compared to RLU in virus control wells after subtraction of background RLU in cell control wells.
SARS-CoV-2 Spike ELISpot assay: Peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated in
vitro with 15-mer peptides (overlapping by 11 amino acids) spanning the full-length Spike protein
sequence of the indicated variants. Variant peptide pools (JPT PepmixTM) included the following
changes to match published deletions/mutation in each variant: B.1.1.7 variant (delta69-70,
delta144, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H), B.1.351 variant (L18F, D80A,
D215G, delta242-244, R246I, K417N, E484K, N501Y, D614G, A701V); P.1 variant L18F, T20N,
P26S, D138Y, R190S, K417T, E484K, N501Y, D614G, H655Y, T1027I, V1176F). Cells were
incubated overnight with peptide pools at a concentration of 1 μg per ml per peptide in a precoated
ELISpot plate, (MabTech, Human IFNγ ELISpot Plus). Cells were then washed off, and the plates
were developed via a biotinylated anti-IFN-γ detection antibody followed by a streptavidin-enzyme
conjugate resulting in visible spots. After plates were developed, spots were scanned and
quantified
using
the
CTL
S6
Micro
Analyzer
(CTL)
with ImmunoCapture and ImmunoSpot software. Values are shown as the backgroundsubtracted average of measured triplicates. The ELISpot assay qualification determined that 12
spot forming units was the lower limit of detection. Thus, anything above this cutoff signal is an
antigen specific cellular response.
Statistical Methods: GraphPad Prism 8.1.2 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA) was used
for graphical and statistical analysis of data sets. P values of <0.05 were considered statistically
significant. A nonparametric two-tailed student t-test Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to
assess statistical significance in Figures 1 and 2.
