Abstract
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense
single stranded RNA virus with high human transmissibility. This study generated
Whole Genome data to determine the origin and pattern of transmission of SARSCoV-2 from the first six cases tested in The Gambia. Total RNA from SARS-CoV-2
was extracted from inactivated nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swabs of six cases and
converted to cDNA following the ARTIC COVID-19 sequencing protocol. Libraries
were constructed with the NEBNext ultra II DNA library prep kit for Illumina and Oxford
Nanopore Ligation sequencing kit and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq and Nanopore
GridION, respectively. Sequencing reads were mapped to the Wuhan reference

genome and compared to eleven other SARS-CoV-2 strains of Asian, European and
American origins. A phylogenetic tree was constructed with the consensus genomes
for local and non-African strains. Three of the Gambian strains had a European origin
(UK and Spain), two strains were of Asian origin (Japan). In The Gambia, Nanopore
and Illumina sequencers were successfully used to identify the sources of SARS-CoV2 infection in COVID-19 cases.

Introduction
The emerging and re-emerging of pathogens such as severe acute respiratory
syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pose a grave threat to human health1. The
SARS-CoV-2 disease, first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has become
a global pandemic2 and is causing an unprecedented burden on the health care
systems and economies globally3-6. Worldwide, the number of cases has been
increasing exponentially6, especially in Europe and America, with significant but
variable case-fatality rates between continents. By April 28th, 2020, there were more
than 3.1 million SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases and more than 200,000 deaths7.
Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases in sub-Saharan Africa are currently
relatively low, possibly due to much lower international air traffic than in other
continents and thus a low number of imported cases9. By the 28th April 2020, The
Gambia, a tourism hotspot, had reported a total of ten SARS-CoV-2 cases, including
one death. While the travel history of index cases may suggest the origin of infection,
phylogenetic analysis of the strains isolated from these cases and contacts will provide
a precise link between local transmission and other global populations.

The first SARS-CoV-2 case was reported to be an acquired zoonotic infection

10, 11

,

followed by efficient and rapid human-to-human transmission from Wuhan, China, to
other Asian countries and then other continents

12–14

. The single stranded positive

sense RNA genome of the SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 10-15. These pathogens pose significant risk to
global health and modern-day life, hence the need for effective strategies to detect the
sources of infections, outbreaks and transmission patterns in different geographical
settings.
The phylogenetic analyses of global SARS-CoV-2 sequences provide insight into the
relatedness of strains from different areas and suggest the transmission of four superclades 16 geographically clustering into viral isolates from Asia (China), US (two super
clades) and Europe. The objective of this analysis was to provide genome data on six
cases of SARS-CoV-2 in The Gambia, determine the source of these strains, baseline
for subsequent local transmission, and contribute genomic diversity data towards local
and global vaccine design. The Oxford Nanopore GridION and Illumina MiSeq
platforms were utilized to sequence the viral genomes from four confirmed SARSCoV-2, one inconclusive and one negative case by rRT-PCR. We also analysed the
genomes of samples classified as indeterminate and negative by RT-PCR (COVID-19
detection assay) from two different cases respectively.

Method:
Sample acquisition
Nasopharyngeal-Oropharyngeal (NP-OP) swabs (451) from SARS-CoV-2 suspected
cases and their contacts were transported to the Medical Research Council Unit The
Gambia at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (MRCG at LSHTM). Of
the 451 samples screened by rRT-PCR, ten were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 cases
and 5 as indeterminate cases (positive for the screening gene and negative for the
SARS-CoV-2 confirmatory gene)

For WGS, four SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases, one indeterminate case and one
negative case were processed (Table 1). In one of the confirmed cases, different
isolates from samples collected up to 10 days apart were sequenced. Of the 6 cases
sequenced, 4 were male; 2 female, there was one death, two recoveries and two
active cases.

RNA extraction
Total RNA was purified from eleven samples (see Table 1) using the QiaAmp viral
RNA mini kit (Qiagen – 52906) following viral inactivation at the MRCG at LSHTM
containment level 3 facility. The purified RNA samples were quantified using Qubit
RNA reagent kit on a Qubit fluorometer 3.0 (concentration range 3-7 ng/μl)
(Invitrogen). RNA integrity (RINe) was checked on the Agilent Tapestation 4200
(Figure 1) yielding a RINe range of 2.1–5.

Ribosomal RNA depletion, cDNA synthesis and Multiplex PCR
Two of the samples (day 0 and 4) from Case A were depleted using the RiboMinus
transcription isolation kit from ThermoFisher and purified using RNA purification beads
from Beckman Coulter. The purified rRNA-depleted samples were converted to cDNA
as per the NEBNext ultra II RNA library prep kit for Illumina (NEB, E7770L). Total RNA
from the rest of the samples was converted to cDNA according to the ARTIC amplicon
sequencing protocol for SARS-CoV-2 17. ARTIC protocol primer 17 schemes for SARSCoV-2 (Version 2) were used for the multiplex PCR. Two primer pools at 10 μM
containing 98 primers each were used for the PCR amplification. The samples were
subjected to 35 cycles of PCR. The purified products were visualised and quantified.

Illumina and Nanopore library Preparation and Sequencing

Illumina library preparation using the NEBNext ultra II DNA library prep kit for Illumina
(New England Biolabs, UK; E7645).
Following 7 cycles of PCR enrichment, the libraries were purified and quantified using
the high sensitivity dsDNA Qubit kit and sized using D1000 ScreenTape on the Agilent
Tapestation 4200 (amplicon size range 519-572 bp). Each sample was normalised to
10 nM before pooling. The pool was run at a final concentration of 10 pM on an Illumina
MiSeq instrument using MiSeq V3 reagent kit. The pool was denatured with sodium
hydroxide according to Illumina recommendation and spiked with 5% PhiX (PhiX
control v3 Illumina Catalogue FC-110-3001) before loading (Fig. 1).

Nanopore library preparation
Nanopore sequencing library preparation was performed according to the
manufacturer's instructions for the Ligation Sequencing Kit (SQK-LSK109, Oxford
Nanopore Technologies). Briefly, the cDNA samples were amplified using the ARTIC
protocol and purified with 1X AMPure XP beads. Individual samples were then
subjected to end repair and adapter ligation following SQK-LSK109 protocol. 20 ng of
each library was loaded on the Oxford Nanopore GridION on individual R9.4.1 flow
cells and sequencing data monitored on the fly using Rampart (v1.1.0).
Quality control and read mapping for Illumina and Nanopore platform
Although a minimum read depth of 30X for the SARS-CoV-2 genome was targeted,
more than 100X coverage was generated on both platforms. FASTQ files were
subjected to various quality control checks and analysed following standard analysis
pipelines (SARS-CoV-2 novel Coronavirus bioinformatics protocol; SAMTOOLS).
For Nanopore data, sequencing reads were quality checked using MinIONQC

18

and

only reads with a minimum Q score of 7 were included in our subsequent analysis.
Quality checked reads were run through what’s in My Pot (WIMP) pipeline on the
Oxford Nanopore EPI2ME platform to verify the number of reads characterised as
SARS-CoV-2.
We used SARS-CoV-2 novel Coronavirus bioinformatics protocol developed by Nick
Loman et. al. to analyse the Nanopore data19. Firstly, we used “ARTIC Guppylex” to
remove chimeric reads from each sample with the following parameters (--min-length
400 –max-length 700). Filtered reads were then mapped to Wuhan-Hu-1 reference
genomes (accession number MN908947.3) and compared to other strains from other

countries (see supplementary table 1a) using MiniMAP2 (v2.17-r941). Single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) were generated based on the reference and a
consensus genome for each sample was generated using SAMTOOLS (v1.9). To
further validate our results, we ran all genomes through the coronavirus typing tool
(v1.13).
Similarly, 250 bp paired end Illumina reads were quality checked using FASTQC
(v0.11.5)

20

. Reads with only a minimum phred score of 30 were included in our

downstream analysis. One sample which was SARS-CoV-2 negative by reversetranscription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was characterised as Bat
coronavirus using kraken and thus excluded from the analysis. Filtered reads were
then mapped to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genomes (accession number
MN908947.3) using BWA-mem (0.7.17-r1188). BCFtools Mpileup (v1.8) was used in
creating a variant file. Finally, BCFtools consensus was used in generating the FASTA
consensus sequence for each sample.
Phylogenetic analysis for Illumina and Nanopore platform
Prank (v140603) was used to generate a multiple alignment of all the samples
including some available reference genomes around the globe (Downloaded from
RefSeq). These strains were selected based on the patients’ travel history and the
major geographical spread of the pandemic. We finally constructed a maximum
likelihood phylogenetic tree using the General time reversible model (GTR) with
IQTREE (v1.3.11.1). The Interactive Tree of Life (ITOL) (v5) was used to visualise and
annotate the phylogenetic tree.

Results and DiscussionWhole genome sequencing data was generated from six confirmed cases from both
sequencing platforms; the additional time points from cases D and E were sequenced
only on the Nanopore GridION (Table 2). Two samples from the first case were
sequenced on both platforms following ribosomal depletion, the results generated (not
included) showed depletion of human sequences and the majority of the reads
mapped to bacterial sequences with only 0.03% from the Illumina reads mapping to
the SARS-CoV-2 reference strain. The rRT-PCR and the sequencing data generated
are summarized in table 2.

ranged from three to six million reads with an average mapping quality of 60 when
mapped to the Wuhan reference genome. The Nanopore platform generated a read
length of 400 - 17000 bp for each sample after 12 hrs of sequencing. It recorded a
range of one to four million reads with average mapping quality of 58 across the
reference genome for each sample. To compare the results from both technologies,
consensus genomes were generated for each sample and a maximum likelihood
phylogenetic tree was constructed. Both platforms showed a similar topology with
1000 bootstrap clustering The Gambian isolates with the European and Asian strains
as illustrated in Figures 2 and 3.

The Gambian to the global circulating strains.
Six genomes (4 samples from Case A, 1 from case D and 1 from case C) from the
Gambian samples clustered with the European (Spanish and United Kingdom) SARSCoV-2 strains. This is not surprising given that these patients had been in Europe
before arriving in The Gambia. Although viruses are known to mutate and change
rapidly, 21, 22 the viral genome of case A clustered on the same node at different time
points indicating the patient was shedding the same virus with no observed
polymorphism according to Nanopore results. Interestingly, the same samples
sequenced on the MiSeq suggested polymorphism at day 10, resulting in a longer
branch length compared to previous time points (Figure 3). Further analysis of the
Illumina data showed seven more SNPs in the day 10 sample compared to the other
time points. The SNP winked by the Nanopore phylogenetically, might have an
associated higher error rate compared to the Illumina. Strains from cases C and D,
both having travelled from France, were more closely related to the Spanish strain

included for comparison. Though cases D and A travelled to The Gambia on the same
flight, their strains had a different origin, indicating that they could have been infected
independently, before the start of their journeys.
The viral genome from case B who initiated travel from Bangladesh and then across
four other countries, including Senegal, before arriving in The Gambia, clustered with
a strain from Japan. This case may have contracted the infection in Asia and his travel
history suggests he could have contributed to infections in other countries. The two
isolates from case E at different time points clustered with strains from Japan as well.
Interestingly, case E samples were indeterminate by rRT-PCR diagnostics, even
though the outcome from multiple alignment showed no mismatch between the
sequences and the primer set. The indeterminate diagnostic rRT-PCR result could be
due to low sensitivity of the assay, an indication of low viral density of SARS-CoV-2 in
the sample. Therefore, subsequent follow up for such cases is essential to further
evaluate diagnosis and aid towards the understanding of the disease progression and
the evolution of this novel virus strain under different case management environments.
Although WGS data is still limited in sub-Saharan Africa, this approach has proven to
be a highly sensitive, specific and confirmatory tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Hence,
the use of second and third generation sequencing technologies coupled with
bioinformatics is quite imperative in providing data for monitoring transmission
dynamics.
From the two sequencing platforms, we were able to rapidly generate sequencing
data, in 20 hours and 3 days after sample reception on the Nanopore and Illumina
platforms, respectively. While Illumina sequencing may be more accurate in
determining within-sample-diversity, Nanopore data can help with the understanding

of the linkage between SNPs within individual virions. The Nanopore platform with its
flexibility for number of samples per run, and the generation of data in real-time and at
a reasonable cost makes it most suitable for outbreaks. Therefore, with our optimised
and ready-to-go workflow, we are set to generate data for tracking SARS-CoV-2 in
The Gambia and other African countries within 24 hours of sample reception. This
would go a long way in providing knowledge on the molecular epidemiology of this
disease, give the true burden of the disease in this setting (as seen in the resolution
of the indeterminate cases) as well as provide information for African specific vaccine
development and inform policy makers on decisions for strategic control measures.
Conclusion:
We have demonstrated that the Nanopore platform with the flexibility of high-end
desktop sequencer (GridION) to the portable sequencer (MinION) in combination with
the ARTIC protocol and workflow allows for cost-effective (wide range for the number
of runs and samples per flow cell), and near real-time generation of pathogen
sequence data. Our analysis has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 strains identified in The
Gambia are of European and Asian origin and sequenced data matched patients’
travel history. In addition, we were able to show that two COVID19 positive cases
travelling in the same flight had in fact different sources of infection.
