On 12th December 2019, a pneumonia case of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan City,
Hubei Province, China, and on 31st December 2019, the disease outbreak was reported to
World Health Organization (WHO). After ruling out possible influenza and other
coronaviruses by laboratory testing, the Chinese authorities isolated a new type of
coronavirus (novel coronavirus, nCoV) on 7th January 2020, which was then named 2019nCoV by WHO on 12th January [1]. As of 22nd January, 571 confirmed cases (including 15
medical staff) and 17 deaths have been reported in China, and 6 cases confirmed overseas [2].
On 20th January 2020. two local infections in the Chinese province of Guangdong with no
direct visit to Wuhan were the first confirmed human-to-human transmission cases [3]. The
asymptomatic incubation period (from infection to symptom onset) for individuals infected
with 2019-nCov was 5-6 days (personal communication), and the virus infectiousness
remained unknown. We estimated the basic and effective reproduction number of 2019-nCoV
and predicted the epidemic peak time and size based on existing epidemiological data and a
dynamic model.

Our mathematical model (details in Appendix) indicates that the national epidemic of 2019nCov in China may lead to a total of 8042 (95%CI: 4199-11884) infections and 898 (3681429) deaths (Figure 1a), corresponding to a fatality rate of 11.02% (9.26-12.78%). This is
lower than the fatality rates of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (14-15%) [4]
and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (34.4%) [5], suggesting that 2019-nCov
may be a less virulent strain in the coronavirus family. Besides, experiences from fighting the
previous coronaviruses may have also added to the rapid response to the epidemic by the
Chinese government and the international society. However, we acknowledge that in the
early phase of the epidemic, the death cases are likely under-reported as many infected cases
have not progressed to the critical stage.

The basic reproduction number (R0) of 2019-nCov, an indication of the initial transmissibility
of the virus, was estimated to be 4.71 (4.50-4.92) when the epidemic started on 12th
December 2019, but its effective reproduction number (Re) has dropped to 2.08 (1.99-2.18) as
of 22th January 2020 (Figure 1b). If the declining trend continues with the assumption of no
resurges of the epidemic, Re will drop below one within three months (77 [75-80] days) of the
epidemic initiation, suggesting that the epidemic will gradually die off after this time.
Compared with SARS and MERS, R0 of 2019-nCov was similar to SARS (R0=4.91) in

Beijing, China, in 2003 [6] and MERS in Jeddah (3.5-6.7) and Riyadh (2.0-2.8), Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia, in 2014 [7].

Timely diagnosis for quarantine and integrated interventions are essential for curbing the
epidemic. If the current intervention continues, the number of infected individuals is expected
to peak in early March 2020 (80 days since initiation) with a peak population size of 827
(421-1232) infectious individuals in China. The current duration from symptom onset to
isolation is about six days. Our model indicates that every one-day reduction in this duration
would reduce the peak population size by 72-84% and the cumulative infected cases and
deaths both by 68-80% (Figure 1c,d). Integrated interventions, such as the promotion of face
mask use and reduction of travel, have been actively implemented. We estimate that every
additional 10% decay in the transmission rate due to integrated interventions would reduce
the peak population size by 20-47%, the cumulative infected cases and deaths both by 23-49%
(Figure 1c,d). Facing the rapidly rising epidemic, the Chinese government has timely
amended the Law of the PRC on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases on 20th
January 2020 to include the 2019-nCov as a class-B infection but manage it as a class-A
infection due to its severity [8]. Consequently, more than 30,000 PCR-fluorescence probing
detection kit for 2019-nCoV RNA has been distributed to designated diagnosis centres in
Wuhan [9]. The Chinese government has also taken an unprecedented action of locking down
Wuhan and its nearby Huangguang city in a bid to minimise person-to-person contact on 23rd
January 2020 [10].

We present a timely evaluation of the Chinese 2019-nCov epidemic in its initial phase, where
2019-nCov demonstrates comparable transmissibility but lower fatality rates than SARS and
MERS. A quick diagnosis that leads to quarantine and integrated interventions will have a
major impact on its future trend. Nevertheless, as China is facing its ‘Spring Festival travel
rush’ and the epidemic has spread beyond its borders, further investigation on its potential
spatiotemporal transmission pattern and novel intervention strategies are warranted.
