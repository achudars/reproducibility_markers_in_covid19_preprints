Abstract
The novel Coronavirus from Wuhan China discovered in December 2019 (nCOV-2019) has
since developed into a global epidemic with major concerns about the possibility of the virus
evolving into something even more sinister. In the present study we constructed the phylo-geonetwork of nCOV-2019 genomes from across India to understand the viral evolution in the
country. A total of 611 full length genomes were extracted from different states of India from
the EpiCov repository of GISAID initiative and NCBI. Their alignment uncovered 270
parsimony informative sites. Further, 339 genomes were divided into 51 haplogroups. The
network revealed the core haplogroup as that of reference sequence NC_045512.2 (Haplogroup
A1) with 157 identical sequences present across 16 states. The rest were having not more than
ten identical sequences across not more than three locations. Interestingly, some locations with
fewer samples have more haplogroups and most haplogroups (41) are localized exclusively to
any one state only, suggesting the local evolution of viruses. The two most common lineages
are B6 and B1 (Pangolin) whereas clade A2a (Covidex) appears to be the most predominant in
India. However, since the pandemic is still emerging, the final outcome will be clear later only.

Introduction
Coronaviruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae have been named so owing to the electron
microscopic structure resemblance of their virion structure to that of a crown. The spikes
present on the virion surface provide for the resemblance. Their genome has a positive single
strand RNA of 26 to 32kb in length and are known to infect a wide range of hosts (Cavanagh,
2007; Ismail et al., 2003; Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Su et al., 2016; Weiss and Navas-Martin,
2005). A novel Coronavirus which has the potential to infect humans has been identified from
Wuhan China in December 2019. It was subsequently referred to as nCOV-2019 (novel
Coronavirus 2019) and since its emergence it has developed into a global epidemic. As of 28th
August 2020, there were 33,10,234 cases and 60,472 deaths in India due to nCOV-2019
(https://www.mygov.in/covid-19). At the same time, as per WHO there have been 24,021,218
cases and 821,462 deaths globally (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). The nCOV2019 is different from earlier Coronavirus outbreaks, severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) coronavirus in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus in
2012 predominantly due to its extremely high transmission rates. The patients infected with
nCOV-2019 have been observed to have varied symptoms ranging from normal flu like
symptoms to high fever to invasive lesions (Chan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Peiris et al.,
2004; Zaki et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2020).

The nCOV-2019 belongs to genus Betacoronavirus and sub genus Sarbecovirus with suggested
origin in bats. Various theories are in discussion about how it reached humans but nothing can
be said with surety just yet (Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). However, the ever-increasing
number of people being infected globally provides for the most conducive environments for
the virus to evolve. The availability of full genome sequences for nCOV-2019 in GISAID has

aided the study of these evolving sequences with both global and local perspectives (Shu and
McCauley, 2017a).

At present, we build and analyze the phylo-geo-network of nCOV-2019 in India based on the
publicly available full-length sequences of nCOV-2019 from India. We performed the
haplogroup analysis and phylogenetic lineage study in addition to their defining mutations and
geographical distributions. This assumes significance with India rapidly moving up the ladder
in sharing the global burden of nCOV-2019 cases and is expected to continue so in near future
owing to its demographic and health care structure.

Materials and Methods
Sequence Acquisition
Genome sequences of nCOV-2019 in FASTA format was assessed from the EpiCovTM
repository (www.epicov.org) of GISAID initiative (Shu and McCauley, 2017b) and NCBI
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

On 6th June, 2020 we retrieved 611 FASTA sequence congregations along their rational meta
data from GISAID EpiCoV server using the data filter ~ virus name: hCoV-19 - Host: Human
- Location: Asia/India – Complete – High Coverage and use the genome ID by excluding the
first part i.e. “EPI_ISL_” of GISAID accession ID. One sequence from the epicenter, Wuhan,
China (NC_045512.2) was taken as reference. Details of the geographical distribution of the
sequences and their accession numbers are provided in Figure 1 and Supplementary file 1
respectively. Location data of GISAID are used to identify the state of origin in India, and
wherein state name is unavailable, state address of the originating lab has been used.

Sequence Alignment
The congregations are aligned with the FFT-NS-fragment method using rapid calculation of
full-length MSA of closely related viral genomes, a light-weight algorithm of MAFFT v7 webserver (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/closelyrelatedviralgenomes.html) (Katoh et
al., 2018) and keeping alignment size exactly throughout the reference sequence. The
nucleotide transformation sites of the alignment were further studied using MEGA X (Kumar
et al., 2018)

Phylogenetic Network Analysis
Aligned sequences were used to generated parsimony based TCS networks (Clement et al.,
2002) implemented in Population Analysis with Reticulate Trees (PopART v1.7) software
(Leigh and Bryant, 2015) where over 5 percent sites contain undefined states and will be
masked. A map of haplotypes was also drawn using the same software with geotags and traits
label coding.

Genome Annotation
The tool IGLSF (Alam et al., 2019) arranges the location of variable sites according to genes.
Using the software DNAPlotter (Carver et al., 2009) we used the Artemis (Carver et al., 2012)
to annotate the genome and visualized it as a circular plot.

Lineage and Subtyping Analysis
In the predefined cluster, using distinct nomenclature methods only a certain sequence belongs
to the haplogroups have been classified into different lineage and subtype. Lineages that
contribute most of the global spread have been assigned through Pangolin (Phylogenetic
Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages) Web (https://pangolin.cog-uk.io/) , using

nomenclature implemented by Rambaut, et al. (Rambaut et al., 2020). Viral subtypes of the
studied Indian population were achieved using ‘SARS Cov 2 Nextstrain’ classification model
of Covidex (https://cacciabue.shinyapps.io/shiny2/), a web-based subtyping tool (Cacciabue et
al., 2020).

Sequence Statistics
Multiple metrics were used to assess the population genetics to decipher the phylogenetic
relationship. We calculated Tajima’s D (Tajima, 1989) statistic to test mutation- drift
equilibrium and Pi value, segregating sites, parsimony-informative sites to measure DNA
polymorphism among sequences using PopART statistics (Leigh and Bryant, 2015).

Results and Discussion
Phylogenetic network analysis
The alignment of genomes and their subsequent analysis revealed a total of 493 segregating
sites of which 270 were parsimony informative (PI) sites. The incidence of sites and their
distribution across gaps and ambiguous sequences and statistical evaluation has been
summarized in Table 1. A negative value of Tajimas D statistic suggests the significance of
these sites in evolution of these genomes. The reported phylo-geo-network herein has been
built using the 152 PI sites excluding the gaps and ambiguous sequences.

The phylo-geo-network analysis of the studied genomes has been represented in Figure 1.
Several observations can be drawn from this analysis and the data forming the basis of this
figure. First, the core of the network with maximum genomes (157) is the node of reference
sequence of nCOV-2019 from Wuhan, China with accession no NC_045512.2. The fact that
this accounts for over one fourth (25.7%) of the total studied sequences is a clear indication

that in spite of many reported variations, the original nCOV-2019 genome continues to be the
dominantly prevalent form. Interestingly, there was one sequence with genome id 458080 from
Telangana which was hundred percent identical to the Wuhan reference sequence
(Supplementary files 1 and 4). Though the absence of travel history for most of the studied
patients and the sequences only being a partial representation of the patients present makes the
conclusion subjective, but it does indicate about arrival of the virus directly from China to
India. Though the variations are fast accumulating in the virus, it's the original one that still
prevails, at least in the Indian context. Viral evolution is a dynamic and fast process but unless
due selection advantage is offered, a new form wouldn’t take over.

Secondly, the distribution of sequences from across India (Figure 1) don’t corroborate with the
incidence scenarios but are a reflection of the ground level preparations and activity in getting
the genomes sequenced. For instance, the under-representation of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu
in the present data set in-spite of being the two most affected states. However, assuming that
the virus has an equal chance of evolving anywhere, we believe the number of sequences
analyzed are apt for giving a glimpse of the ongoing viral evolution.

Thirdly, when we analyzed the distribution of PI sites across the genome and found it to be
non-uniform in nature. We studied the distribution in the form of strike-rate of PI sites which
we define as the number of bases after which there will be another PI site. This is to say that a
region with a strike rate of 20 would mean a PI site every 20 bases and so on. Thus, a lower
strike rate will infer a higher density of the PI sites in the region (Table 2). Based on our
analysis, the Envelope and Spike protein have a PI strike rate of 45 and 115 respectively (Table
2). Before drawing any conclusions, we need to understand that a higher incidence of PI sites
doesn’t necessarily corroborate to driving the evolutionary process as their impact on protein

functionality needs to be ascertained first. However, it does indicate the potential genomic
regions for the same which herein appear to be Envelope and Spike protein.

Haplogroup analysis and distribution
The network tree construction was accompanied by haplogroup determination of the studied
genomes. The nodes representing haplogroups in phylo-geo-network in Figure 1 have been
named as per accession number of the sequence defining the haplogroup. The nodal haplogroup
represented by the Wuhan reference sequence NC_045512.2 has two maxima associated with
it. The number of sequences therein as represented by the diameter of the circle (157 sequences)
and total number of locations (16 states) in which the sequences are distributed. The details of
distribution of all identical sequences have been summarized in Figure 2a and Supplementary
file 2.

Of the 611 studied genomes, the 51 haplogroups account for 339 genomes. At this juncture,
we would like to note about the sequences left out of haplogroups. They belong to haplotypes
which may converge to an existing haplogroup or emerge as a new one as the pandemic
progresses. Due to the high mutation rate of viruses and with ever increasing incidence of the
diseases the virus is replicating more and more and new polymorphisms are being generated
every day. These variations are changing the haplotype and haplogroup profile on a regular
basis.

We propose the nomenclature of the 51 observed haplogroups as per the path used to construct
the network. We will explain the haplogroup nomenclature by taking a couple of examples.
The haplogroup having NC_045512.2 was named A1 as the core of the network. From this
cluster many haplogroups emerged and so on. The haplogroup A1.1 (420544) is defined by

five positions; 241 (C→T), 3037 (C→T), 4809 (C→T), 14408 (C→T) and 23403 (A→G).
However, as we move to haplogroup A1.1.1 (420543), in addition to the above mutations,
another one at position 8782 (C→T) is present which becomes the defining polymorphism for
this haplogroup. Similarly, haplogroup A1.6 (435063) is defined by positions 241(C→T), 1059
(C→T), 3037 (C→T), 14408 (C→T), 23403 (A→G) and 25563 (G→T). Subsequently
haplogroup A1.6.1 (444471) is characterized by mutation at positions 18877 (C→T) and 26735
(C→T) and haplogroup A1.6.1.1 by additional mutations at 22444 (C→T) and 28854 (C→T).
The haplogroup lineage thus defined clearly indicates that A1 is the most prevalent one while
A1.6 is the most evolving one as it has the maximum number of steps going up to A1.6.1.1.1.4
reflective of five steps and stages of mutations/PI sites. The position of all the observed PI sites
has been listed in Table 2/Figure 2b and their details are summarized in Supplementary file 3.
The haplogroup nomenclature has been listed in correlation with their genome IDs and location
in Table 3. If we observe the PI sites reported in the study, it includes most of the commonly
reported sites from across the world besides some novel ones. However, we aren’t emphasizing
on the novelty of sites due to the fast-changing scenario and rapidly emerging data.

The geographical distribution of the haplogroups can be looked at from two different aspects.
To begin with, which haplogroup is found in which location. Herein, A1 (NC_045512.2)
haplogroup as already mentioned was most widely prevalent with 157 sequences distributed
across 16 locations. All other haplogroups had ten or fewer genomes spread across one to three
locations (Figure 2a). The scenario is more interesting if we inverse the analysis as in which
location had how many haplogroups. Gujarat with a maximal representation of 199 genomes
had 27 different haplogroups but this isn’t the norm as in more sequences would mean more
haplogroups. Delhi (63 genomes, 3 haplogroups), Maharashtra (94 genomes, 9 haplogroups)
and West Bengal (40 genomes,7 haplogroups) exhibit the non-linearity of the same. Also, 41

haplogroups have a single location only led by Gujarat (21), Maharashtra (6), West Bengal,
Telangana, Tamil Nadu (4 each) and Ladakh, Orissa (1 each). Three states Punjab, Andhra
Pradesh and Kerala don’t have any haplogroup so far. The distribution of haplogroups across
states has been shown in Figure 1 and Supplementary file 2. The fact that some locations with
fewer samples have more haplogroups and most haplogroups are localized exclusively to a
single state is a clear indication about the local evolution of viruses. However, since the
pandemic is still emerging, the final outcome will be clear only at a later stage.

Lineage and Subtype Analysis
We also ascertained the lineage and subtype of the observed sequences through Pangolin and
Covidex respectively. Also, the presence of lineages in India across the world was studied. The
fact that phylogenetic lineage of nCOV-2019 genomes from India exhibits its relation with
diverse countries like USA, Australia, UK, Singapore, China and Turkey is reflective of the
global nature of the pandemic. Most of it can be attributed to international air travel and diverse
regulations across countries. The three most common lineages in India as predicted by Pangolin
are B6, B1 and B1.36 whereas clade A2a appears to be the most predominant one as predicted
by Covidex (Figure 2c, Table 3, Supplementary file 4). These lineages can shift with increasing
incidences and accumulating variations which requires regular monitoring. However, proper
recording of both national and international travel history for all the patients will go a long way
in unveiling the true path of viral evolution.

Conclusions
The understanding of emergence and evolution of nCOV-2019 pandemic in India is an apt set
up to understand viral divergence and evolution due to its huge population and diversity. As of
now, the virus most prevalent in India is of the same haplogroup as the nCOV-2019 reference

sequence from Wuhan indicating absence of any significant novel emerging strain. The two
most common lineages are B6 and B1 whereas clade A2a appears to be the most predominant
one in Indian context. However, with ever increasing incidence the situation needs to be
monitored regularly.

Figure Legends
Figure 1: Phylogenomic geographic network of nCOV-2019 genomes from India. The
nodes have been named after the Accession No of the defining sequences representing a
particular cluster. The diameter of the circle represents the number of samples present therein.
more the samples, longer the diameter. The different locations within India have been
represented by color coding and the number of sequences from each state are shown in the
bottom scale of the graph. Also shown are the distribution of haplogroups across different states
in the maps on the periphery. On the right side are haplogroups present only in one state only
whereas others include those present on multiple locations. Maps are generated and powered
by Bing (©Geo Names, Microsoft, TomTom) through MS Excel 2019.
Figure 2: a) Prevalence and geographical distribution of 51 haplogroups of nCOV-2019
genomes in India. The number of identical sequences present in a haplogroup are shown on
primary vertical axis whereas number of locations wherein its distribution is shown on
secondary vertical axes. Note the maximum prevalence and widespread distribution of
NC_045512.2 containing haplogroup (A1). For details of haplogroup IDs, identical sequences
and locations please refer to Supplementary file 2. b) Distribution of parsimony informative
sites across the nCOV-2019 genome. The nCOV-2019 genome has been represented
circularly along with the locations of different genes/ORFs/Non coding regions have been
represented. PI sites are shown as lines traversing the circle. 2c) Lineage and Subtype
Analysis of nCOV-2019 genomes in India. The outermost circle represents haplogroups
reported in the study whereas the middle circle depicts lineage prediction by Pangolin web.
The innermost circle is the clade analysis by Covidex web-tool.
