Main Text

48

In the last 20 years, coronaviruses have cyclically caused three major infectious

49

outbreaks in human, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (1), Middle

50

East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (2), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (3,

51

4). It is possible that future outbreaks are caused by not yet discovered coronaviruses.

52

To treat COVID-19 and prepare for future coronavirus outbreaks, broad-spectrum

53

coronavirus controlling strategies are sought after. So far, only small molecule drug

54

remdesivir with broad (in theory) but marginal efficacies has been approved for treating

55

COVID-19 (5, 6), the latest pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome

56

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). No drugs with conclusive benefits have ever been

57

approved for SARS or MERS.

58

Coronaviruses are highly glycosylated and mutate frequently. For example,

59

analyses of over 28,000 gene sequences of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein) in

60

May 2020 revealed a D614G amino acid substitution (SARS-CoV-2-D614G) that was

61

rare before March 2020, but increased greatly in frequency as the pandemic spread

62

worldwide, reaching over 74% of all published sequences by June 2020(7). Frequent

63

mutation renders coronaviruses the ability to evade single target-specific medications

64

easily (8, 9). In theory, broad-spectrum coronavirus drugs have the best chance to

65

withstand viral mutations and offer patients long-term benefits.

66

The key to develop broad-spectrum coronavirus therapeutics is to identify

67

broad-spectrum druggable and specific anti-viral targets. Remdesivir interferes with the

68

action of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and evades proofreading by viral

69

exoribonuclease, causing decrease in viral RNA production (5, 6). Although RNA

70

polymerase is a broad anti-RNA virus target, it suffers from low specificity and efficacy.

71

Recently, a peptide, named P9R, has been demonstrated to have broad antiviral

72

activities against respiratory viruses including influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, but it

73

is a general immunosuppressant and not coronavirus specific (10). By employing a

74

multi-dimensional approach, Gordon et al. proposed a set of potential “pan” viral target

75

for coronaviruses, but the druggability of these targets are yet to be evaluated (11).

76

The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is triggered by binding of their envelope

77

spike glycoproteins (S-protein) to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) molecules

78

expressed on host cells (12, 13). The S-protein consists of two subunits: 1) S1-subunit

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.11.375972; this version posted November 12, 2020. The copyright holder for this

79

(also called S1-protein) at N-terminal containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD)

80

that is responsible for ACE2 binding; 2) S2-subunit at C-terminal responsible for

81

membrane fusion (13). Due to its importance in viral entry, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2

82

has been heavily targeted by antibodies as well as small molecule approaches (14-18),

83

but RBD-targeting approaches in general are not broad spectrum due to the diversity of

84

RBD sequences.

85

ACE2 is a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein that plays important roles in

86

maintaining blood pressure homeostasis in the renin-angiotensin system (19, 20).

87

Mysteriously, it serves as the shared receptor in human and several other host species

88

for multiple coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63, etc.

89

(12, 21, 22). SARS-CoV, a close sibling of SARS-CoV-2 in coronavirus family, was the

90

culprit that caused the prior coronavirus outbreak in 2003 (3), while HCoV-NL63

91

infects human much more frequently but usually causes only cold symptoms with

92

moderate clinical impacts (23). Binding of coronavirus to ACE2 not only facilitates

93

viral entry into the host cells, but also down-regulates ACE2 expression (24, 25).

94

Previous results revealed that RBD binding site of ACE2 does not overlap with its

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.11.375972; this version posted November 12, 2020. The copyright holder for this

95

catalytic site (26-28), it is therefore hypothesized that targeting ACE2 with neutralizing

96

antibodies can block the entry of all ACE2-dependent coronaviruses, while sparing

97

ACE2’s physiological activities. Such antibodies can, in theory, be utilized in managing

98

both current and future coronavirus outbreaks and tolerate viral mutations. By targeting

99

ACE2, additionally, the antibody could be evaluated in HCoV-NL63 patients even

100

when COVID-19 patients are no longer available for clinical trials. To test our

101

hypothesis, we generated an ACE2-targeting monoclonal antibody, namely 3E8, to

102

neutralize S1/ACE2 interactions. The therapeutic potentials and safety profiles of 3E8

103

were investigated and the key binding sites of 3E8 on human ACE2 molecule were

104

revealed by cyro-EM to aid future drug discovery endeavor.

111

and light (VL) chains were cloned into human IgG4 backbone, transiently expressed in

112

HEK293F cells and purified (Fig. S1C).

113

We then measured the binding affinity of 3E8 to His-tagged human ACE2 protein

114

with ELISA and biolayer interferometry (BLI). The EC50 value was 15.35 nM in ELISA

115

(Fig. 1A) and dissociation constant (KD) was 32.6 nM in BLI (Fig. 1B). It also bound to

116

HEK293F cells ectopically overexpressing human ACE2 and Vero E6 cells endogenously

117

expressing human ACE2, as demonstrated by flow cytometry (Fig. S1D).

118

We next investigated the ability of 3E8 to neutralize S1-subunit/ACE2 interaction.

119

S1-subunits from SARS-CoV-2-D614G, SARS-CoV-2 (D614), SARS-CoV and

120

HCoV-NL63 were included. SARS-CoV-2-D614G and SARS-CoV-2 represent 64.6%

121

and 30% respectively of all analyzed SARS-CoV-2 sequences in GISAID database. The

122

EC50 values of S1-subunits from different coronaviruses (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1E) to

123

His-tagged recombinant human ACE2 molecule were 2.58, 11.82, 1.13 and 24.24 nM,

124

respectively (Fig. 1E). Incubation with 3E8 effectively neutralized all S-subunit binding

125

to ACE2 (Fig. 1D) and the IC50 values were 13.80, 7.12, 13.73 and 4.96 nM, respectively

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.11.375972; this version posted November 12, 2020. The copyright holder for this

126

(Fig. 1E). Thus, 3E8 can broadly neutralize the binding of S1-subunits from 4 different

127

multiple coronaviruses to human ACE2 molecules.

128

To further test our hypothesis, we constructed pseudo-typed coronaviruses with

129

full-length S-proteins from SARS-CoV-2-D614G, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and

130

HCoV-NL63. All pseudoviruses could infect HEK293F cells that ectopically express

131

human ACE2, while SARS-CoV-2-D614G showed significantly-enhanced infectivity

132

when compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 (D614) (Fig. S2). Incubation with 3E8 fully

133

abolished the infectivity of all pseudoviruses, with IC50 values at 0.13, 0.07, 0.24 and

134

1.06 nM, respectively (Fig. 2, A, C). In comparison, B38, a SARS-CoV-2

135

RBD-targeting antibody currently under clinical development (29), could only suppress

136

the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2-D614G and SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV or

137

HCoV-NL63. The suppression of 3E8 was not only broader, but also remarkably more

138

efficacious and potent, as the EC50 values of 3E8 was 230- and 618-fold improved when

139

compared to B38 in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-D614G and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2C).

140

ACE2-Fc, a virus RBD-targeting fusion protein consisting human ACE2 extracellular

141

domain and the Fc region of human IgG1, showed broad but mediocre blocking on

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.11.375972; this version posted November 12, 2020. The copyright holder for this

142

pseudoviruses. Our investigation indicated that 3E8 might be a powerful broad-spectrum

143

coronavirus blocker.

144

Our results were also confirmed by live virus study in a BSL-3 laboratory setting.

145

Results showed that incubation with 3E8 inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner,

146

the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells. The virus RBD-targeting B38 antibody,

147

also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, but was 60-fold less potent than 3E8, as

148

suggested by the difference between their IC50 values (2.32 vs. 0.04 nM), even though

149

both of them completely abolished SARS-CoV-2 replication at higher concentrations

150

(Fig. 2, B, C).

151

More importantly, the neutralizing ability of 3E8 was validated in a mouse model

152

of COVID-19. This model was generated by exogenous delivery of hACE2 with

153

Venezuelan equine encephalitis replicon particles, VEEV-VRP-hACE2, and was

154

published previously (30). After VEEV-VRP-hACE2 transfection and antibody

155

application, mice were infected with 105 PFU of live SARS-CoV-2 via intranasal route,

156

and then viral RNA loads and tissue damages in lungs were examined 3 days post

157

infection. Consistent with our in vitro results, application of 3E8 protected lungs from

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.11.375972; this version posted November 12, 2020. The copyright holder for this

158

virus infection, as indicated by approximately 40-fold reduction in lung viral loads (Fig.

159

3A) and ameliorated tissue damages (Fig. 3B). In comparison, the viral loads in

160

B38-treated mice were only about 5 times lower than that of control mice. Thus,

161

application of 3E8 achieved significantly greater anti-viral effects than that of B38 in

162

the COVID-19 mouse model we employed.

163

Since ACE2 plays important roles in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis in

164

the renin-angiotensin system, we evaluated the safety risks of 3E8 both in vitro and in

165

vivo. Our studies with both recombinant ACE2 protein and Vero E6 cells suggested that

166

3E8 had no effects on ACE2’s catalytic activities even at a concentration as high as

167

666.7 nM (Fig. 4A, B). Furthermore, incubation with 3E8 did not trigger a clear trend of

168

ACE2 degradation in Vero E6 cells, as indicated by Western blot (Fig. 4C). Although

169

3E8 caused time-dependent internalization of ACE2, the levels of membrane-expressed

170

ACE2 were stabilized after 24 h of 3E8 incubation (Fig. 4D). In limited number of

171

human ACE2 “knock-in” mice, which only express human version of ACE2, injection

172

of 3E8 did not induce noticeable changes in body weights, or blood chemistry profiles

173

(Fig. S3). In addition, there are no obvious difference in shape, size and pathology of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.11.375972; this version posted November 12, 2020. The copyright holder for this

174

major organs, including hearts, livers, kidneys, spleens and lungs of treated mice (Fig.

175

S3).

176

To characterize the epitope recognized by 3E8 on ACE2, we solved the Cryo-EM

177

structure of the ACE2-B0AT1 complex bound with 3E8 at an overall resolution of 3.2

178

Å (Fig. 5A). Each ACE2 molecule in the complex is bound by a 3E8 molecule that

179

extends from the complex like a wing (Fig. 5A). The heavy chain of 3E8 binds to the

180

peptidase domain of ACE2 mainly through polar interactions between the

181

complementarity-determining region (CDR) 2 and 3 of 3E8 and the N-terminal α1 helix

182

of ACE2 (Fig. 5B). The loop between α2 and α3 of ACE2, referred to as Loop2-3, also

183

contribute limited interactions with 3E8. The resolution at the interface was improved to

184

3.4 Å by applying focused refinement, supporting detailed analysis on the interactions

185

between ACE2 and 3E8. The interface can be divided into two clusters. At cluster 1, the

186

side chains of Asp103 and Arg104 of 3E8 are hydrogen (H) bonded with the main chain

187

of Phe28 in α1 helix of ACE2 and the side chain of Tyr83 in Loop2-3 of ACE2,

188

respectively (Fig. 5C). Meanwhile, the main chain atoms of Asp103 and Asp104 of 3E8

189

form H-bonds with the side chain of Gln24 of ACE2. At cluster 2, Tyr54 and Tyr102 of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.11.375972; this version posted November 12, 2020. The copyright holder for this

190

3E8 interact with Lys31 of ACE2 through cation-π interactions, whereas Asn55 and

191

Lys59 of 3E8 interact with His34 of ACE2 and Glu23 and Gln18 of ACE2, respectively,

192

by forming H-bonds between side chains of these residues (Fig. 5D). Structural

193

alignment of the 3E8/ACE2-B0AT1 complex with the previously reported

194

RBD/ACE2-B0AT1 complex reveals clash between 3E8 and RBD of the SARS-CoV-2

195

S protein at the binding interface with ACE2 (Fig. 5E), providing explanation for the

196

results of competition assays. The binding site of 3E8, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and

197

HCoV-NL63 on ACE2 were summarized (31-33) (Fig. 5F), and the bound ACE2 at

198

His34 together, which suggested that His34 residue might be critical in

199

anti-coronaviruses activity. Evolutionary tree of 3E8 binding site on ACE2 with

200

different species were also analysed, and there was some phylogenetic diversity on

201

some sites, such as 23, 24, 31 and 34.

202

The mechanism by which 3E8 is more potent and efficacious than RBD-targeting

203

antibody B38 is not yet fully understood. Limited by the sample size, it is premature to

204

conclude that targeting ACE2 is superior to targeting viral RBD in potency and efficacy.

205

B38 is one of the early anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies isolated from COVID-19 patients

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.11.375972; this version posted November 12, 2020. The copyright holder for this

206

and due to the urgent nature, it might not be well engineered with respect to affinity and

207

developability. More head-to-head studies with more ACE2- and RBD-targeting

208

molecules are necessary before drawing any conclusion.

209

Our result indicated that ACE2-Fc (or called ACE2-Ig) fusion protein molecules

210

may act as a “decoy” to interfere coronaviruses from binding to the endogenous ACE2

211

molecules (Fig. 2). Although ACE2-Fc molecules can be broad-spectrum in theory,

212

their binding affinity (to RBDs), specificity and developability are usually much lower

213

than antibodies. ACE2-Fc was included in our studies as a control and mediocre

214

efficacy was observed in vitro. Thus, we believe that ACE2-neutralizing antibody is a

215

more favorable approach than ACE2-fc fusion protein approach.

216

“Cocktail” or combination therapies have been currently explored in treating

217

COVID-19 (14). A combination of 3E8 with antibodies or fusion proteins recognizing

218

different epitopes (e.g., RBD, NTD and/or glycan) on the viral surface, such as RBD,

219

seems a viable option and should be explored.

220

It is not surprising that no serious side effect or toxicity of 3E8 were observed in

221

vitro or in human ACE2 “knock-in” mice. In vitro, 3E8 did not affect the catalytic

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.11.375972; this version posted November 12, 2020. The copyright holder for this

222

activities of ACE2 or trigger significant ACE2 down-regulation. Even though ACE2

223

internalization was overserved, the levels of membrane ACE2 expression were

224

stabilized after 24 h. It is possible that the ACE2 molecules remaining on the membrane

225

were enough to maintain the physiological functions of ACE2-expressing cells.

226

Previous studies showed that ACE2 “knockout” mice were viable and healthy in general,

227

even though the contratile dysfunction was founded (34), indicating that ACE2 is not

228

crucial to the survival of animals. Due to limited animal availability, the conclusion

229

from human ACE2 “knock-in” mice should not be overinterpreted. We plan to repeat

230

this study when more animals are commercially available. Moreover, key signs of

231

cardiovascular health, such as pulse pressure and heartbeat rate, cannot be measured in

232

mice. Thus, the side effects and toxicities of 3E8 should be carefully evaluated in

233

non-human primates before moving to the clinic.

234

To our knowledge, it is the first time that a “pan” anti-coronavirus epitope has ever

235

been disclosed. Current coronavirus-targeting antibodies focus mainly on highly

236

conserved region of RBD, such as 47D11 (16) and S309 (15). The epitope of 3E8

237

binding on ACE2 is identified only partially overlapping with that of RBD domain, but

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.11.375972; this version posted November 12, 2020. The copyright holder for this

238

blocked virus infections with remarkable efficiency, demonstrating the extraordinary

239

power of ACE2 targeting strategy. Previously, an neutralizing antibody (4A8) (35) was

240

isolated from convalescent COVID-19 patients with binding on the N-terminal domain

241

(NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, but not the RBD. Our results highlighted again

242

the importance of epitope outside or on the verge of RBD/ACE2 interface, and would

243

facilitate future endeavor searching for broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus approaches.

244

Taken together, by targeting ACE2 with a neutralizing antibody, we achieved

245

broader and more effective suppression against ACE2-depedent coronaviruses without

246

causing any serious side effects or toxicities. Furthermore, we revealed in the first time

247

a broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus epitope on ACE2. Overall, we presented evidence

248

that 3E8 is a promising therapeutic candidate for both current and future

249

coronavirus-triggered epidemics and disclosed the first time a “pan” anti-coronavirus
