In only a few months, the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic, leaving physicians, scientists, and public health
officials racing to understand, treat, and contain this zoonotic disease. SARS-CoV-2 has made
the leap from animals to humans, but little is known about variations in species susceptibility
that could identify potential reservoir species, animal models, and the risk to pets, wildlife, and
livestock. While there is evidence that certain species, such as cats, are susceptible, the vast
majority of animal species, including those in close contact with humans, have unknown
susceptibility. Hence, methods to predict their infection risk are urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2
spike protein binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critical for viral cell entry
and infection. Here we identified key ACE2 residues that distinguish susceptible from resistant
species using in-depth sequence and structural analyses of ACE2 and its binding to SARSCoV-2. Our findings have important implications for identification of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2
residues for therapeutic targeting and identification of animal species with increased
susceptibility for infection on which to focus research and protection measures for
environmental and public health.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the
global pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19) that is impacting millions of lives and
the global economy. Covid-19 is a zoonotic infection capable of crossing the species barrier.
SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in bats and subsequently transmitted to humans,
perhaps through a secondary host.1,2 Emerging experimental and observational evidence
demonstrates differences in species susceptibility to infection. For example, humans, house
cats, tigers, and lions are all susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2.3-6 Golden Syrian hamsters
and rhesus monkeys are also capable of being experimentally infected by SARS-CoV-2 and
developing Covid-19 pathologies.7,8 In contrast, observational and experimental studies with
direct intranasal inoculation have demonstrated that chickens, ducks, and mice are not
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.5,9-11 Interestingly however, susceptibility is not
dichotomous. Although ferrets are also susceptible to infection, intranasal inoculation failed to
result in spread of infection to the lower respiratory tract, significantly limiting symptom
development.5 In addition, although dogs failed to exhibit infection of the respiratory tract and
appear asymptomatic, a minority of experimentally or environmentally exposed dogs exhibited
evidence of infection by SARS-CoV-2 PCR or SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion with production of
SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies.5,12 While pigs have not demonstrated evidence of infection
after intranasal inoculation, overexpression of swine ACE2 in cultured cells supports some
degree of viral entry.5,9,13 Hence, ferrets, dogs, and pigs are classified as having intermediate
susceptibility to infection. Despite these findings, the number of animal species tested for
susceptibility to infection in experimental or observational studies is very limited. Thus, methods
of determining risk of species with unknown susceptibility are urgently needed to reduce risk of
propagating transmission, protect food supplies, identify potential intermediate hosts, and
discover animal models for research. Identifying the key residues mediating susceptibility to
infection can also guide rational drug design.

SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the coronavirus family of single-stranded RNA viruses.9 The spike
protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus mediates interaction with its receptor,
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to promote membrane fusion and virus entry into the
cell. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein contains a receptor binding motif
(RBM) that binds to the peptidase domain of ACE2.14 Following spike protein cleavage, fusion of
the viral and host cell membranes occurs to enable viral entry into the cell.15 Interaction of the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD and ACE2 is thus critical for viral cell entry and infection.9 The
importance of this interaction in infection is further supported by evidence that exogenous
soluble ACE2 limits infection in human organoids,10 and that overexpression of human ACE2 is
necessary to enable viral cell entry in HeLa cells in vitro and SARS-CoV-2 infection in mouse
models in vivo.9,16

ACE2 is present in almost all vertebrates, however sequence differences exist that may hold
clues to differences in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, as has been observed for SARS-CoV.17,18
Understanding such differences could provide insight into key structural interactions between
ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD important for infection, and permit development of a susceptibility
score for estimating the infection risk of various species. In this manuscript we integrate

experimentally validated differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection with ACE2
sequence comparisons and in-depth structural analyses to determine how differences in ACE2
across species influence interaction with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We identified multiple key residues
mediating structural interactions between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD and use these residues
to generate a susceptibility score to predict animals with elevated risk of infection. We also
demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is nearly optimal for binding ACE2 of humans compared to other
animals, which may underlie the highly contagious nature of this virus amongst humans. Our
findings have important implications for identification of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 residues for
therapeutic targeting and identification of animal species with increased susceptibility for
infection on which to focus research and protection efforts.

Given experimental evidence for susceptibility of humans, house cats, tigers, lions, rhesus
macaques, and Golden Syrian hamsters to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and experimental evidence
for non-susceptibility of mice, ducks, and chickens,3-5,7,9-11,19 we performed protein sequence
alignment of ACE2 from these organisms using MAFFT (Extended Data Figure 1).20 We also
included species with intermediate susceptibility, including dogs, pigs, and ferrets,5,9,12 as well
as species with unknown susceptibility, including camels, horses, Malayan pangolin, and sheep.
The degree of similarity of ACE2 protein sequences largely fell along expected phylogenetic
relationships among species (Extended Data Figure 2). Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2
infection, however, did not match either phylogenetic relationships or ACE2 sequence
similarities across species. For example, mouse (Mus musculus) is not susceptible to infection.
However, mouse ACE2 sequence is more similar to a susceptible species, Golden Syrian
hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), than non-susceptible species such as duck (Aythya fuligula) or
chicken (Gallus gallus).9,16 In addition, mice are phylogenetically more similar to susceptible
species such as humans (Homo sapiens) and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) than nonsusceptible species such as ducks and chicken.9,16 These findings suggest that neither
phylogenetic relationships nor overall ACE2 protein sequence similarity across species is able
to predict susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

An alternative approach is to use the experimentally validated differences in infection
susceptibility across species to focus on ACE2 amino acids that most differ between susceptible
and non-susceptible species. We thus calculated a weighted score of how well the aligned
amino acids stratify susceptible versus non-susceptible species, incorporating amino acid
similarity. This score, termed GroupSim, permits quantitative determination of which amino
acids in the alignment best stratify susceptible from non-susceptible species.21 This analysis
demonstrated that multiple amino acid positions in the ACE2 alignment, including Leu79, His34,
Tyr83, and Gln24, are highly similar in susceptible species and quite different in non-susceptible

species (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplemental Table 1). When mapping these scores
onto the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 complex, multiple residues with high
GroupSim scores were present at or near the binding interface including His34, Asp30, Thr92,
Gln24, Lys31, and Leu79 (Figure 1). We then extended this analysis by focusing on key
residues previously demonstrated from prior structural analysis to be important for ACE2 and
SARS-CoV-2 RBD interactions (Table 1).7,22-24 Interestingly, this revealed that key amino acids
for the ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interaction were enriched among the top scoring
GroupSim positions (7 of 35; p<0.0001; Fisher’s exact test). Such key residues based on
structural analysis being over-represented in amino acid positions that best discriminated
susceptible from non-susceptible species suggests that structural interactions between ACE2
and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein importantly determine differences in species susceptibility to
infection. In addition, these data suggest that certain ACE2 amino acid residues may be
particularly important for determining susceptibility, including Leu79, His34, Tyr83, Gln24,
Lys31, Asp30, and Glu329.

We used homology modeling to identify structural determinants of binding the ACE2 protein
from species with known differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The models
were based on previously reported crystal structures of the human ACE2 in complex with
SARS-CoV-2 (PDB: 6LZG and 6M0J).14 We modeled ACE2 in the presence of the SARS-CoV-2
RBD to allow backbone adjustment to the binder and refined by redocking of the RBD domain to
optimize sidechains. Models were selected by overall calculated protein stability of the SARSCoV-2 RBD complex, predicted binding energy between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and
similarity (as Cα-root mean square deviation [Cα-RMSD], Extended Data Figure 3 and
Extended Data Figure 4). Based on these models, multiple approaches where undertaken to
investigate the structural interactions between SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2.

We evaluated the overall calculated protein stability and predicted binding energy for SARSCoV-2-RBD and ACE2 complexes for each species. We considered the 100 best models for
each species and evaluated evidence for difference in binding energy or stability between
susceptible and non-susceptible species. The average mean predicted binding energy and
calculated protein stability differs across species (Figure 2). Consistent with the lack of
susceptibility of chickens (Gallus gallus), chicken ACE2 in complex with SARS-CoV-2-RBD was
the lowest scoring, or most energetically unfavorable model. The complex with duck ACE2
(Aythya fuligula) shows similarly unfavorable scores, indicating that ACE2 sequence differences
leading to a lower structural binding ability in these two avian species may explain their lack of
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the complex of SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2
of the non-susceptible mouse (Mus musculus) exhibits lower binding energy and higher protein
stability than several species that are susceptible, including the lion (Panthera leo), tiger
(Panthera tigris), and cat (Felis catus). Thus, differences in SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 complex
stability have some discriminative power but are not the sole factor in differences in
susceptibility across species.

As a complementary approach to determine whether particular residues may discriminate
susceptible from non-susceptible species, we performed energetic modeling of residue-residue
interactions in the interface of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 using Rosetta. Although the overall
interaction pattern across residues is similar between susceptible, non-susceptible, and
intermediate susceptibility species, there are significant differences in the magnitude of residueresidue interactions (Figure 3). For example, residue 30 (which is an aspartate in all susceptible
species) forms a strong ionic interaction with lysine 417 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and interacts
modestly with other residues, including Phe456 and Tyr473. In contrast, in non-susceptible
species such as chicken and duck where residue 30 contains an alanine this interaction is no
longer present and is not substituted by any other structural rearrangements that might
accommodate this change. Mouse (Mus musculus) ACE2 contains an asparagine in position 30
instead of an aspartate, which results in lower predicted binding energy due to the lack of an
ionic interaction. A close-up view of residue 30 shows the different structural environment
available in the non-susceptible species chicken, duck, and mouse as compared to susceptible
species, including human (Figure 4). This analysis also identifies residue 83 of ACE2 as having
differential energetic interactions across species. Residue 83 is a tyrosine in susceptible species
and a phenylalanine in non-susceptible species (Table 1). Compared to susceptible species,
this position exhibits significantly decreased binding energy with residues Asn487 and Tyr489 in
SARS-CoV-2 RBD in non-susceptible species (Figure 3). Although ACE2 residue 83 also
interacts with SARS-CoV-2 RBD phenylalanine 486, this interaction is unlikely to be significantly
affected by differences between tyrosine and phenylalanine. However, the hydroxyl group of
tyrosine at position 83 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone oxygen of asparagine 487 that
is negatively impacted by substitution to phenylalanine in non-susceptible species (Figure 5A).
In addition to this residue-residue structural analysis, both ACE2 positions 30 and 83 were
identified through the GroupSim analysis described above to be top residues discriminating
susceptible from non-susceptible species based on sequence alignment (Extended Data Table
1). These results suggest that these amino acid positions of ACE2 may be important mediators
of the structural interaction of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD and determinants of differences to
susceptibility to infection across species.

It is an evolutionary advantage for SARS-CoV-2 to maintain its ability to infect multiple species.
Thus, we hypothesized that the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD is not optimized for a single
species but is capable of binding ACE2 of multiple species. Multistate design is a computational
approach to test this hypothesis. It allows us to determine the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD
that is optimal for binding ACE2 of multiple species. We used Restraint Convergence (RECON)
multistate design to test this hypothesis. This method determines how many mutations one
protein requires to acquire affinity for multiple targets at once.25,26

We adapted this strategy to evaluate the ability of the SARS-CoV-2-RBD to bind non-human
ACE2 variants starting from the constraint of the known binding to human ACE2. We

hypothesized that engineering a SARS-CoV-2 RBD with binding affinity for ACE2 from nonsusceptible species would require more changes to binding interface residues than for
susceptible species. To test this hypothesis, we redesigned the SARS-CoV-2 RBD interface
sequence using RECON in the presence of the known binder, human ACE2, and ACE2 from
other species in turn (Figure 6A).

As an initial positive control, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was redesigned against human ACE2 only.
By mutating multiple SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues to improve binding affinity, we tested at each
designable position the frequency of native sequence recovery, which measures the fraction of
models in which the native SARS-CoV-2 RBD amino acid is retained. This resulted in very few
proposed amino acid changes of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to optimally bind human ACE2, indicating
that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD sequence overall represents a solution close to optimal (Figure 6B).
The exception is valine 503, for which more polar amino acids were deemed optimal. This
valine, however, is near a glycosylation site at asparagine 322 in ACE2 at the SARS-CoV-2 and
ACE2 interface (Extended Data Figure 5). Since glycans are not incorporated into the RECON
multistate design technique, this valine 503 may have a higher affinity binding partner when
considering the presence of ACE2 glycosylation sites..

Designing SARS-CoV-2 RBD in the presence of ACE2 from additional species revealed that
ACE2 from a number of species have lower sequence recovery (including non-susceptible
species such as duck and chicken, but also hamster, macaque, cat, lion and dog). When
evaluating residue-specific interactions based on the native sequence recovery from RECON
multistate design, tyrosine 505 shows no sequence recovery in avian species as compared to
the human ACE2 control. This tyrosine interacts very prominently with lysine 353 in ACE2,
however this residue is highly conserved across all species examined (Table 1). Tyrosine 505
also interacts less strongly with glycine 354, which is occupied by an asparagine in the avian
species (chicken and duck) (Table 1 and Figure 5B). This secondary interaction might explain
the differences in native sequence recovery. However, another experimentally verified nonsusceptible species, the mouse (Mus musculus), has a high degree of sequence recovery,
similar to human ACE2. This suggests that other factors beyond residue-residue interactions of
ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD at the interface may determine susceptibility to infection, at least
in the mouse, and that differences in RECON multistate design explain only partially differences
in species susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

As a final additional approach to structurally evaluate differences in species susceptibility, we
investigated the predicted glycosylation profiles of various species in comparison to human
ACE2. Protein glycosylation is increasingly recognized as a critical contributor to receptor-ligand
interactions;27 however, given the challenges in identifying glycans in protein crystal structures,
glycosylation has received considerably less attention than SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2
protein-protein interactions. Naturally occurring glycans as posttranslational modifications are
not fully visible in crystal structures. Normally only the first N-actylglucosamine is visible or no
sugar moiety can be observed, or glycosylation sites are mutated prior to crystallization. In the
crystal structures of the human ACE2 used here, a sugar moiety bound to an asparagine at a

surface exposed NXT/S sequon was seen three times in proximity to the binding interface on
the ACE2. To understand whether the ACE2 of other species have similar glycosylation
patterns, glycosylation was predicted using NetNGlyc 1.0, a neural network for predicting Nglycosylation sites, and compared to the glycosylation patterns of human ACE2.28 Residues 53,
90, 103, and 322 were identified as glycosylation sites in human ACE2, with 53, 90, and 322
demonstrating glycosylation in the crystal structure (PDB: 6M0J and 6LZG)14 (Table 2). Other
susceptible species were quite similar to this pattern, except for position 103, which is only
predicted to be glycosylated in humans and rhesus macaques. Among known susceptible
species, only Golden Syrian hamster ACE2 lacks predicted glycosylation in position 322. At
position 90, all susceptible species were predicted to be glycosylated and all non-susceptible
and intermediate susceptibility species were non-glycosylated. Interestingly, ACE2 from the
non-susceptible mouse, despite not showing significant differences in predicted binding energy
or RECON multistate analysis compared to susceptible species, is predicted to lack
glycosylation at residues 90 and 322, distinguishing it from ACE2 of nearly all susceptible
species. This suggests a potential mechanism by which mice may be non-susceptible despite
having similar binding energy and SARS-CoV-2 native sequence recovery to susceptible
species.

Taken together, results of these studies reveal a set of key ACE2 residues important for
interaction with SARS-CoV-2 RBD and for which differences help discriminate susceptible from
non-susceptible species. These differences include ACE2 amino acid positions 30 and 83,
which exhibit differential residue-residue binding energy, position 354, which exhibits low native
sequence recovery in interaction with SARS-CoV-2, and positions 90 and 322, which exhibit
differences in glycosylation. Using these key residues in aggregate, we developed a SARSCoV-2 susceptibility score based on similarity to the human ACE2 sequence using the
BLOSUM62 similarity matrix (Table 3).29 This analysis revealed that experimentally validated
non-susceptible species have in fact the lowest susceptibility scores, while species with
previously demonstrated intermediate susceptibility have intermediate susceptibility scores.
Using the lowest score of the susceptible species, 23, as the lower cutoff for susceptibility and
the highest score of non-susceptible species, 11, as the upper cutoff for non-susceptibility, we
extended these results to species with unknown susceptibility. This revealed high scores in the
susceptible range for the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), horse (Equus caballus),
and camels (Camelus dromedarius and Camelus bactrianus) and intermediate susceptibility
scores for the Malayan pangolin (Manis javanica), cow (Bos taurus), goat (Capra hircus), and
sheep (Ovis aries).

To permit wider use of this susceptibility score for evaluation of additional species with unknown
susceptibility, including those species that in the future may be of particular concern, we
developed an implementation of the susceptibility score algorithm in R for public use. This
implementation takes as input human ACE2 aligned with ACE2 of another species of interest
and provides a susceptibility score using differences in ACE2 positions 30, 83, 90, 322, and
354. R code for implementation of this algorithm as a graphical user interface is available in

Here we tested the hypothesis that differences in ACE2 proteins across various species alter
structural interactions with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, leading to differences in species susceptibility to
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results, combining prior knowledge of experimentally validated
differences in species susceptibility with multiple methods of determining effects on ACE2
structure and interaction with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, reveal five key residues that in aggregate help
discriminate susceptibility across species. These include ACE2 positions 30, 83, and 354, which
exhibit alterations in binding energy, and positions 90 and 322, which exhibit alterations in
glycosylation that likely contribute to differences in interactions at the interface. Taken together,
our results provide insight into the molecular determinants of species susceptibility to SARSCoV-2 infection and have important implications for identification of key residues for therapeutic
targeting and determining susceptibility of additional species to infection.

Our study has several unique features that permit rigorous evaluation of differences in species
susceptibility to infection. Prior studies have similarly performed ACE2 sequence alignments
across species and modeled structural effects of the amino acid changes on the SARS-CoV-2
and ACE2 interface.7,30-35 However, our study integrates experimentally validated susceptibility
to SARS-CoV-2 with in-depth structural analyses to determine critical ACE2 residues for
infection. In addition, we performed multiple structural analyses, including residue-residue
interactions, RECON multistate design, and glycosylation analysis, to rigorously determine the
structural basis for species differences in ACE2 interaction with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Prior
studies of ACE2 sequence alignment with limited structural modeling have suggested that pigs
are susceptible to infection,36 and that hamsters and house cats are in an intermediate risk
group.37 Recent experimental work with direct inoculation, however, has demonstrated that pigs
are non-susceptible,5 and that house cats and Golden Syrian hamsters are susceptible.5,7 We
identified key residues on which to build a susceptibility score that closely matches
experimentally verified in vivo susceptibility, including predicting an intermediate susceptibility of
the pig and higher susceptibility of house cats and Golden Syrian hamsters.

A key principle revealed by our findings is the importance of using multiple methods for
determining the structural basis for differences in ACE2 interaction with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. For
example, although calculated binding energy, protein stability, and RECON multistate design of
SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with duck and chicken ACE2 distinguished non-susceptible
chicken and duck ACE2 from susceptible species, mouse ACE2 did not fit the pattern of other
non-susceptible species. However, analysis of ACE2 protein glycosylation revealed two
residues, 90 and 322, for which differences in mouse ACE2 distinguished it from susceptible
species. In addition, combining ACE2 sequence alignment, GroupSim calculations, and residueresidue interaction modeling identified residues 30 and 83, which are distinctly different in all
non-susceptible compared to susceptible species. Differences in these residues in nonsusceptible species result in decreased binding energy with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Although no
single residue appears capable of explaining the difference in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2
infection across species, in combination amino acid positions 30, 83, 90, 322, and 354 can help
distinguish susceptible from non-susceptible species, as reflected by the calculated

Our findings have important implications for determining infectability of animals with heretofore
unknown susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Determining such susceptibility is critical to
prevent disruption to food supplies, identify optimal animal models for research, aid in the
search for intermediate hosts, and enhance identification of potential animal reservoirs that can
propagate transmission.38 We applied our infection susceptibility score to several important
species with unknown susceptibility to date. These data suggest that cows (Bos taurus),
Malayan pangolin (Manis javanica), and goats (Capra hircus) have intermediate susceptibility to
infection, while Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus), horses (Equus caballus), and
camels (Camelus dromedarius and Camelus bactrianus) have higher susceptibility. Although
the ultimate test is direct exposure of live animals to evaluate infectability and transmissability,5,7
this is complicated by the need for BSL3 containment and is quite costly and challenging with
larger animals. Observational studies and case reports could also help provide evidence of
susceptibility. Indeed, our results suggest that horses and camels should be tested and/or
closely monitored for evidence of Covid-19 infection. The close interaction of these animals with
humans, and the importance of these animals as domestic companions and laborers worldwide
make determination of their susceptibility an urgent need. The use of the susceptibility score
developed here can also be applied to additional species of interest to help direct resources for
focused research and protection efforts in the future.

ACE2 residues identified in this paper that provide a structural basis to differences in species
susceptibility to infection reveal important insights into the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2
structural interaction and potential for therapeutic targeting. By incorporating differences in
species susceptibility into the structural analysis, our findings enhance the potential to identify
particularly important residues mediating the ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD interaction. Indeed,
although GroupSim scores were not used in the structural analysis, three of the five key
identified residues (30, 83, and 90) from the structural modeling are in the top scoring ACE2
positions by GroupSim score. This suggests that the amino acids at these positions in ACE2
differ significantly between susceptible and non-susceptible species, consistent with an
important contribution of these residues to differences in susceptibility. Amino acid positions 30
and 83 of ACE2 in particular exhibited large differences in residue-residue interaction binding
energies between susceptible and non-susceptible species. Asp30 on ACE2 interacts with
residues Lys417, Phe456, and Tyr473 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and ACE2 Tyr83 interacts with
Asn487 and Tyr489 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD. These amino acids mark sites of SARS-CoV-2
interaction with ACE2 that may be important for development of antibody-based therapies or
small molecule inhibitors.

Applying a multistate design algorithm to probe the SARS-CoV-2-RBD interactions for their
ability to cross-bind to ACE2 of multiple species yielded several novel observations. First, this
technique identified ACE2 position 354 as an important site for differentiating binding and nonbinding ACE2 of different species to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Second, this approach demonstrated
that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD sequence is nearly optimal for binding to human ACE2 compared to
other species. This is a remarkable finding, and likely underlies the high transmissibility of this

virus amongst humans. This finding is also consistent with recent results that compared SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 and determined that a number of differences in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD
have made it a much more potent binder to human ACE2 through the introduction of numerous
hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic networks.39

Although ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD interactions are critical to SARS-CoV-2 infection,9,10,16
differences in other factors across species may also contribute to differences in susceptibility.
This includes differences in ACE2 expression levels40 and differences in the protein sequence of
TMPRSS2, a protein that contributes to viral and host cell membrane fusion through cleavage of
spike protein.15,41 With further experimental and observational data on infectability of currently
unknown species, the susceptibility score we have developed can also help determine species
for which differences in ACE2 protein may not inadequately predict differences in susceptibility.
For these species future studies could compare differences in expression levels of ACE2 and/or
differences in TMPRSS2 structure. These structural comparisons of TMPRSS2, however, will
require elucidation of the protein crystal structure, which is not yet available.

We combined in-depth structural analyses with knowledge of varying species susceptibility to
SARS-CoV-2 infection to determine key structural determinants of infection susceptibility. First,
we identified multiple key residues mediating structural interactions between ACE2 and SARSCoV-2 RBD. Differences in these residues were used to generate a susceptibility score that can
help predict animals with elevated risk of infection for which we do not yet have experimental
evidence of susceptibility, including horses and camels. Finally, we have demonstrated that
SARS-CoV-2 is nearly optimal for binding ACE2 of humans compared to other animals, which
may underlie the highly contagious transmissibility of this virus amongst humans. Taken
together, results of these studies identify key structural regions of the ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2
interaction for therapeutic targeting and for identifying animal species on which to focus
additional research and protection efforts for environmental and public health.

differences in binding interactions of positions 30 and 34 (magenta) of ACE2 from each species
with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Position 30 is occupied by an aspartic acid (D) in susceptible
humans (Homo sapiens), is an asparagine (N) in non-susceptible mice (Mus musculus), and an
alanine (A) in the avian species (Aythya fuligula and Gallus gallus). Glutamic acid (E) is present
at position 30 in pig (Sus scrofa) and Malayan pangolin (Manis javanicus), representing
intermediate and unknown susceptible species, respectively. Position 34 is conserved as
histidine (H) in all susceptible species such as humans, yet has another residue identity in
intermediate and non-susceptible species. Species names in orange are susceptible, green are
non-susceptible, blue are intermediate susceptibility, and black are unknown.

Figure 5: Binding interactions of ACE2 positions 83 and 354 differ across susceptible
and non-susceptible species. (A) ACE2 position 83 (magenta) is a tyrosine in the human
susceptible species (left) and phenylalanine in the non-susceptible mouse species (right).
Tyrosine 83 of human ACE2 interacts with asparagine 87 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, probably via a
hydrogen bond. Phenylalanine in mouse ACE2 cannot interact with asparagine 487 due to the
lack of a hydrogen bond donor. (B) Interactions of tyrosine r505 of the SARS-CoV-2-RBD (cyan)
with ACE2 residues 353 and residue 354 (magenta). ACE2 residue 353 is conserved as lysine
with the only exception of a histidine in the mouse ACE2. ACE2 residue 354 is a glycine in the
susceptible species (human), but an asparagine in non-susceptible duck and chicken, and a
histidine in pangolin (unknown susceptibility). Species names in orange are susceptible, green
are non-susceptible, and black are unknown.

Figure 6: Multistate design reveals SARS-CoV-2 RBD Tyr505 to have low native sequence
recovery in non-susceptible duck and chicken. (A) RECON multistate design overview. In
the presence of ACE2 from two different species the SARS-CoV-2-RBD interface is redesigned.
When two true binders are redesigned they should require few sequence changes, thus
resulting in a higher native sequence recovery. In contrast, if the native sequence recovery for
the interface residues is lower, then many sequence changes are required, indicating that one
of the ACE2 proteins is a non-binder. (B) Residue-specific native sequence recovery as
determined from RECON multistate design against the SARS-CoV-2-RBD complex with human
ACE2. Only residues of the SARS-CoV-2-RBD, which are in the protein-protein interface and
show changes are depicted. Tyrosine 505 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD shows low native sequence
recovery (black) in non-susceptible duck (Gallus gallus) and chicken (Aythya fuligula). The

Protein sequence accession numbers and corresponding FASTA files from multiple species
(Extended Data Table 2) were pulled from NCBI using Batch Entrez. In the absence of a
published sequence and accession number, ACE2 protein sequence for the lion (Panthera leo)
was assembled using TBLASTN (National Center for Biotechnology Information) with tiger
ACE2 protein sequence as the query (Extended Data Table 3). Protein sequences were loaded
into EMBL-EBI web interface implementation of MAFFT for multiple sequence alignment using
default settings (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mafft/).20 Resulting alignment was uploaded to
ESPript 3.0 to generate a graphical version of the alignment
(http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/ESPript/), including annotation of secondary structure based on
Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure 1r42 of human ACE2.42 A treedyn format tree diagram
representing similarity of ACE2 protein sequence across species was generated using
phylogeny.fr (https://www.phylogeny.fr/).43,44 NCBI Taxonomy Browser was used to generate a
taxonomic tree of phylogenetic relationships amongst species as a Phylogeny Inference
Package (PHYLIP) tree.45 Final visualization was performed using the interactive Tree of Life
(iTOL) tree viewer v 5.5.1 (https://itol.embl.de/).46

1 were obtained with 1 assigned to the position that best stratifies susceptible and nonsusceptible species. Values are weighted by the BLOSUM62 similarity matrix to incorporate
similarity of amino acids properties.29

ACE2 of human and non-human species was modeled based on two co-crystal structures of
SARS-CoV-2-RBD with the human ACE2 (PDB-IDs 6LZG and 6M0J).14 One co-crystal structure
(PDB-ID 6VW1) was excluded due to its lower resolution as compared to the aforementioned
structures. The target sequences were threaded over the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2-RBD co-crystal
structure, which was first relaxed with backbone constraints using RosettaRelax.47 A total of
1000 homology models were constructed using RosettaCM, and subsequently relaxed with
backbone constraints.47,48 Of these, 25 models were selected based on the total energy as a
measure of protein stability, predicted binding energy, and Cα-root mean square deviation (CαRMSD) to the best scoring model (Extended Data Figure 3). The SARS-CoV-2-RBD-ACE2
complex was optimized using a rigid-body docking with limited degrees for rotational and
torsional sampling.49,50 A final ensemble of 100 models was selected based on the total energy
as measure of protein stability, predicted binding energy and Cα-RMSD to the best scoring
model (Extended Data Figure 4). The pairwise binding interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and
ACE2 was evaluated by retrieving the decomposed Rosetta scores for each residue. The
protocol was tested by modeling the human ACE2 in complex with SARS-CoV-2-RBD, and

RECON multistate design was carried out as reported previously for each susceptible, nonsusceptible, intermediate, and unknown species against the human SARS-CoV-2-RBD-ACE2
complex.25,26,51 As a control, this was also performed solely using the human SARS-CoV-2RBD-ACE2 complex. A total of 5000 models were sampled and trajectories with final models
that scored lower than -2400 REU were evaluated. The native sequence recovery was
calculated for each pairwise experiment and also for the control run for the SARS-CoV-2-RBD
complex with the human ACE2 (Extended Data Figure 6).

All protocols were executed using Rosetta-3.12 (www.rosettacommons.org). Evaluation was
performed using the numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries in Python 3.7, PyMOL
2.752-54 and GraphPad Prism version 8.3.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego,
California). Example commands and RosettaScripts protocols can be found in the

The NetNGlyc 1.0 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/) was used to predict
glycosylation sites.28 Based from the observation that asparagine in positions 53, 90, and 322
carried glycosylation in the crystal structures PDB: 6LZG and 6M0J, and scored with high
confidence from NetNGlyc 1.0, these were selected as reliably glycosylated. Position 103 was
included, as it was strongly predicted to be glycosylated by NetNGlyc 1.0, although no
glycosylation was observed in the crystal structures. Furthermore, it was evaluated whether the
NxT/S sequons were surface accessible and in proximity to the ACE2-SARs-CoV-2-RBD
binding interface.

Using identified ACE2 key amino acid positions 30, 83, 90, 322, and 354 in the alignment of
ACE2 across species, a global susceptibility score was calculated as the sum of the Blosum62
scoring matrix substitutions for the amino acid at each position compared to the human ACE2
sequence.29 This was calculated for each species, with higher scores suggesting greater
susceptibility. An R implementation of this susceptibility score algorithm was also developed in
RStudio. The software takes as input alignment of human ACE2 protein sequence with ACE2 of
another species of interest and provides a susceptibility score as output. Susceptibility scores of
species examined in this manuscript are also graphically demonstrated as reference. Code for
implementing this algorithm in R as a graphical user interface is available in Supplemental
Methods.

Extended Data Figure 3: Construction of SARS-CoV-2-RBD-ACE2 complex models for
each species resulted in comparable high-quality models. Models were evaluated for their
Cα-root mean square deviation (Cα-RMSD) as a measure of similarity to the best performing
model by predicted binding energy versus calculated protein stability. Models in the lower left
quadrant of the plots show good convergence of calculated protein stability and similarity, and
were thus selected for re-docking of SARS-CoV-2-RBD to the respective ACE2 as in Extended
Data Figure 4.

Extended Data Figure 4: Re-docking of SARS-CoV-2-RBD to ACE2 of different species
resulted in high-quality models. Cα-root mean square deviation (Cα-RMSD) were calculated
against the best performing model and plotted versus predicted binding energy (dG_separated)
after redocking of the SARS-CoV-2-RBD for all SARS-CoV-2-RBD-ACE2 co-complexes. This
measure describes the similarity of the models compared to their predicted binding energy.
Models from the lowest left corner represent the highest quality models and where chosen for
further analysis. The models for Mus musculus were recalculated to the second-best model
(magenta), as they did not converge on the best model.
