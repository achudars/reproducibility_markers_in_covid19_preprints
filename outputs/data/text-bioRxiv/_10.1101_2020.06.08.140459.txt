Evolutionary and structural analyses of SARS-CoV-2 D614G
spike protein mutation now documented worldwide

30

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2

31

(SARS-CoV-2), was declared on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization. As of the 31 st

32

of May, 2020, there have been more than 6 million COVID-19 cases diagnosed worldwide and

33

over 370,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins. Thousands of SARS-CoV-2 strains have been

34

sequenced to date, providing a valuable opportunity to investigate the evolution of the virus on a

35

global scale. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of over 1,225 SARS-CoV-2 genomes spanning

36

from late December 2019 to mid-March 2020. We identified a missense mutation, D614G, in the

37

spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which has emerged as a predominant clade in Europe (954 of 1,449

38

(66%) sequences) and is spreading worldwide (1,237 of 2,795 (44%) sequences). Molecular dating

39

analysis estimated the emergence of this clade around mid-to-late January (10 - 25 January)

40

2020. We also applied structural bioinformatics to assess D614G potential impact on the

41

virulence and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. In silico analyses on the spike protein structure

42

suggests that the mutation is most likely neutral to protein function as it relates to its interaction

43

with the human ACE2 receptor. The lack of clinical metadata available prevented our

44

investigation of association between viral clade and disease severity phenotype. Future work that

45

can leverage clinical outcome data with both viral and human genomic diversity is needed to

46

monitor the pandemic.

47
48

In late December 2019, a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases was reported and epidemiologically

49

linked to a wholesale seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China 1. The causative agent was

50

identified as a novel RNA virus of the family Coronaviridae and was subsequently designated SARS-

51

CoV-2 owing to its high overall nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV, which was responsible for

52

previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome in humans between 2002-2004 2,3. Previous

53

studies of SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced during the early months of the epidemic (late December

54

2019 up to early February 2020) estimated the time of its emergence at the end of November (18 th and

55

25th)4–6, approximately a month before the first confirmed cases. It has been hypothesized that SARS-

56

CoV-2 may have undergone a period of cryptic transmission in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic

57

individuals, or in unidentified pneumonia cases prior to the cluster reported in Wuhan in late December

58

20193. Based on the high nucleotide identity of SARS-CoV-2 to a bat coronavirus isolate (96%) 7, a

59

possible scenario is that SARS-CoV-2 had undergone a period of adaptation in an as yet identified

60

animal host, facilitating its capacity to jump species boundaries and infect humans 3. The present rapid

61

spread of the virus worldwide, coupled with its associated mortality, raises an important concern of its

62

further potential to adapt to more highly transmissible or virulent forms.

63
64

The availability of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences concurrent with the present outbreak provides a

65

valuable resource for improving our understanding of viral evolution across location and time. We

66

performed an initial phylogenetic analysis of 749 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from late-December

67

2019 to March 13, 2020 (based on publicly available genome sequences on GISAID) and noted 152

68

SARS-CoV-2 sequences initially isolated in Europe beginning in February, 2020, which appear to have

69

emerged as a distinct phylogenetic clade. Upon further investigation, we found that these strains are

70

distinguished by a derived missense mutation in the spike protein (S-protein) encoding gene, resulting

71

in an amino acid change from an aspartate to a glycine residue at position 614 (D614G). At the time of

72

our study, the D614G mutation was at particularly high frequency 20/23 (87%) among Italian SARS-

73

CoV-2 sequenced specimens, which was then emerging as the most severely affected country outside of

74

China, with an overall case fatality rate of 7.2%8.

75
76

During the course of our analysis, the number of available SARS-CoV-2 genomes increased

77

substantially. We subsequently analyzed a total of 2,795 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2

78

(Supplementary data Table 1). For those sequences with demographics (65% of sequenced specimens),

79

the male to female ratio was 0.56:0.44, with a median age of 49 years old, and a range from less than 1

80

to 99 years old. As of 30 March 2020, the D614G clade includes 954 of 1,449 (66%) of European

81

specimens and 1,237 of 2,795 (44%) worldwide sequenced specimens. A comparison against the

82

previous set of genomes collected for our phylogenetic and molecular dating analysis revealed that for

83

samples submitted during the period from March 17-30, 2020, the D614G clade became increasingly

84

prevalent worldwide, expanding from 22 to 42 countries (Figure 1), as also reported previously 9,10. The

85

demographic distribution for this mutation, when known, (male to female ratio, 0.56:0.44; median age,

86

48 years old; age range, less than 1 to 99 years old) was not significantly different compared to the

87

reported demographics for all sequenced SARS-CoV-2 specimens.

88
89

We employed molecular dating to estimate the time of emergence of the D614G clade. Based on a

90

curated set of 442 genomes representing the sequence diversity of SARS-CoV-2 samples available at

91

the time of analysis (30 March 2020), the mean time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) was

92

estimated to be on 18 January 2020 (95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval: 10 January - 25

93

January), indicating its relatively recent emergence (Figure 2). Although the mutation appears to be

94

clade-specific, we noted that D614G also arose another time in a single isolate belonging to a distinct

95

lineage, Wuhan/HBCDC-HB-06/2020 (EPI 412982), collected on 7 February 2020. Given the high

96

degree of nucleotide identity of the D614G clade (~99.6%), we expect that future tMRCA estimates

97

will not differ substantially. The mean tMRCA for the root of the tree was estimated to be 13 November

98

2019 (95% HPD interval: 19 October 2019 to 5 December 2019) which is similar to what has been

99

estimated previously4. Multiple factors can influence these estimates as more data become available:

100

increased diversity and number of strains included for analysis, expanded range of sampling dates

101

compared to earlier studies, as well as incomplete/biased sampling of available genomes. Therefore,

102

caution should be used when inferring broad and definite conclusions about the epidemiology of the

103

emerging outbreak in real-time, particularly as the early undocumented stages of SARS-CoV-2

104

transmission is largely unknown3. They should be taken as tentative estimates based on limited

105

information, which are subject to change as more information becomes available and compared to other

106

epidemiological information. For instance, as different countries review and test archived specimens

107

from cases of severe pneumonia or influenza-like illness for SARS-CoV-2, it is expected that additional

108

cases may be identified, such as in France where a patient without travel history to China was identified

109

to have COVID-19 in late December concurrent with the initial reported cases from Wuhan 11. These

110

retrospective analyses will provide crucial insights into the early transmission dynamics and evolution

111

of SARS-CoV-2 and its rapid global spread.

112
113

From our findings of the recent emergence of the D614G clade and the increasing number of specimens

114

harboring the mutation identified worldwide, we sought to investigate the potential significance of the

115

mutation on clinical disease severity phenotypes. Unfortunately, only limited clinical disease severity

116

data was available for patients whose sequenced samples were included in our analysis (asymptomatic

117

64, symptomatic 8, mild symptoms 2, pneumonia 4, hospitalized 163, released 48, recovered 26,

118

nursing home 3, live 24, ICU 2, deceased 1), preventing us from being able to meaningfully correlate

119

disease severity and genotype from these data. However, using country-wide crude case fatality data

120

for countries from which sequencing data was available, there was no significant correlation between

121

proportion of D614G clade sequences and crude case fatality rate as of 30 March 2020 (Spearman’s

122

rank correlation coefficient, r 0.22, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.51). In addition, on analysis of crude case fatality

123

rate by age-group (available for China, Italy, South Korea, Spain, and Canada) there was no significant

124

correlation with proportion of D614G clades in the sequences analysed for these countries

125

(Supplementary Table 2)8,12–14 A major limitation of this analysis is that publicly available SARS-CoV-

126

2 genomes are the result of convenience sampling and are not expected to provide an accurate

127

representation of the spatial-demographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes. Therefore, one must

128

be cautious about making inferences about severity and transmission of variants 15 from genomic

129

sequence data alone.

130
131

The possibility that the D614G mutation may still have a potential impact on the function of the SARS-

132

CoV-2 spike protein could not be excluded. Previous studies of SARS-CoV have shown that the

133

sequential accumulation of mutations in the spike protein increased its affinity to ACE2 and likely

134

impacted its transmission and disease severity during the course of outbreaks in 2002-2004 16–18.

135

Recently, Phan et al. studied 86 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes, identifying 42 missense mutations,

136

eight of which occurred in the S-protein gene2. However, at the time of their study, the mutation

137

D614G was only found in one sequence from Germany (collected on 28 January, 2020). Modifications

138

in the spike protein are of interest as they might indicate the emergence of a novel strain of SARS-CoV-

139

2 with change in transmissibility or pathogenicity. Therefore, we investigated the potential functional

140

and epidemiological consequences of the D614G mutation with structural modeling of the SARS-CoV-

141

2 spike (S) protein and its interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.

142
143

The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is shown in Figure 3. The S protein is a heavily

144

glycosylated trimeric protein that mediates entry to host cells via fusion with ACE2. Recently, Wrapp

145

and colleagues used Cryo-EM to determine the structure of the S protein and analyze its

146

conformational changes during infection19. Using their three-dimensional model of the S protein

147

structure, we set out to investigate the effects that a mutation in position 614 might have. First, we

148

analyzed changes in inter-atomic contacts within a radius of 6 Å from position 614 before and after

149

substitution of aspartate by glycine. Notably, four inter-chain destabilizing (i.e., hydrophobic-

150

hydrophilic) contacts are lost with residues of an adjacent chain upon D614G mutation (see Table 1 and

151

Figure 3C). This suggests that a small repelling interaction between adjacent chains is removed upon

152

this aspartate substitution (see Table 1). However, it is unlikely that this would have a significant effect

153

on recognition and binding to ACE2 given the relative distal position of this mutation with respect to

154

the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (see Figure 3B), but further analyses would be required to assess

155

whether the D614G mutation has an effect on the way the S protein changes its conformation after

156

interaction with ACE2. Lan and colleagues also showed residues in the RBD act as epitopes for SARS-

157

CoV-2 and mutations can influence antibody binding 20. Given the important role that glycosylation

158

plays in regulating the function of spike proteins in coronaviruses21, we decided to search for potential

159

changes in a glycosylated residue (asparagine) in position 616. As shown in Figure 3D, this residue and

160

aspartate 614 are oriented in opposite directions, suggesting that substitution by glycine also has a null

161

effect on this interaction. Finally, neither position 614 nor the inter-atomic contacts at positions 854,

162

859, 860, 861 of the spike protein lie in a polybasic cleavage region which is of importance for SARS-

163

CoV-2 as it has been proposed to activate the protein for membrane fusion 22. Our results are consistent

164

with the work by Wrapp and colleagues, where they identified nine missense mutations (including

165

D614G) in the spike protein that were thought to be relatively conservative and thus unlikely to affect

166

protein function19.

167
168

There were important limitations faced in our present analysis which are likely to be a significant

169

hurdle to similar studies in the future. The lack of available clinical metadata prevented our

170

investigation of association between viral clade and disease severity phenotype. Additionally, numbers

171

of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples vary greatly between countries and may be subject to potential

172

sampling bias. It is important to note that current country level data on crude case fatality rates and case

173

numbers do not permit robust comparison of clinical phenotype across countries due to significant

174

differences in population demographics, testing protocols, case definitions and implementation of

175

public health measures. Accordingly, it was not possible to draw any conclusions regarding the clinical

176

phenotype of the D614G clade and there is no evidence at this time to suggest this clade is associated

177

with any differences in disease phenotype. As a potential proxy measure for viral load, we reviewed the

178

cycle threshold (Ct) values of the SARS-CoV-2 assay for samples sequenced from Ontario, Canada

179

(total n = 178, with 50 and 128 samples possessing the spike protein 614-D and 614-G mutations,

180

respectively). In this small selection of samples, we found no significant difference in the average Ct

181

for 614-D and 614-G mutations (mean 22.35, SD 5.13 and mean 22.32, SD 5.188 respectively, t-test p-

182

value = 0.978) (Figure 4). We do note, however, that numerous factors affect the measurement and

183

limit the reliability of Ct value measurement, including sample type, quality of swabs, quality of

184

collection method, and time from onset to sample collection 23. In contrast, another study has found a

185

statistically significant decrease in PCR Ct values associated with the mutated amino acid G variant 10

186

but its clinical significance remains unclear. In spite of the lack of evidence for phenotypic differences,

187

it is interesting that in a short period of time since its emergence the D614G clade has become

188

widespread all around the world. It is possible that even if the observed mutation does not impact the

189

protein’s interaction with ACE2, it may not be completely neutral with respect to viral fitness. For

190

example, given that the molecular weight of glycine is significantly smaller than that of aspartate, the

191

mutation could be advantageous from a cost minimization point of view 24. It is also possible that the

192

mutation may be in linkage disequilibrium with a selectively advantageous variant impacting another

193

aspect of viral reproduction. For example, most strains of the D614G clade also harbor a mutation

194

(P4715L) in orf1ab and a subclade processes three nucleotide changes in the nucleoprotein (N) gene

195

(GGG to AAC; G204R), which plays diverse roles in virion assembly as well as genome transcription

196

and translation25,26. Most recently, it has been suggested that D614G introduces a new elastase cleavage

197

site that may be differentially activated by host genomic mutations thereby facilitating spike

198

processing, and entry into host cells in some host populations but not others 27. Finally, the global

199

spread of the D614G mutation may have nothing to do with viral biology but may simply be a

200

consequence of the high level of interconnectedness of Europe to the rest of the world. Thus, the

201

emergence of the D614G clade may be explained by a founder event and subsequent clonal expansion

202

in Europe that led to its spreading worldwide.

203
204

Genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis are powerful approaches to track viral evolution during

205

the course of a pandemic and help coordinate the global implementation of strategies for decreasing

206

virus transmission and mitigating global mortality. However, our study highlights that caution is

207

warranted in hastily drawing conclusions from limited observational data. Future work that can

208

leverage clinical outcome data with both viral and human genomic diversity, in vitro and in vivo tests

209

and in silico modeling will greatly enhance our ability to understand if specific SARS-CoV-2 clades are

210

evolving with respect to virulence or transmissibility, and identify genetic variants associated with viral

211

adaptation, transmissibility, and mortality. These data will be essential for effective vaccine

212

development and public health responses to this emergent pandemic.

Materials and Methods

214

Sequence data, demographics, maps and statistics

215

A total of 2,803 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 (excluding non-human sequences specimens) and

216

demographics when available were obtained from GISAID (http://gisaid.org/) (downloaded on 30

217

March 2020) to perform the statistical analyses of the D614G mutation (8 sequences were excluded due

218

to ambiguous or unknown nucleotide at this position). The dataset included sequences representing 55

219

countries. The world geographical maps were built with the geographic information system QGIS

220

(v2.18.21, https://qgis.org). Global CFR was calculated from data according to Johns Hopkins as of 30

221

March 2020. CFR for age groups of different countries were extracted from country-specific published

222

data 8,12–14. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis was performed using GraphPad prism (v 8.3.1).

223
224

PCR and sequencing

225

SARS-CoV-2 E-gene PCR on respiratory specimens (e.g. nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar

226

lavages) submitted to Public Health Ontario Laboratory was performed as previously described 28.

227

Specimens with Ct values of 32 or less were selected for whole genome sequencing. Briefly, rRNA

228

depleted RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen/Life

229

Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) to cDNA using tagged random primer (5'-GTTTCCCAGTCACGATA-

230

(N9)-3') followed by second strand DNA synthesis using Sequenase (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

231

Waltham,

232

GTTTCCCAGTCACGATA-3' using AccuTaq™ LA DNA Polymerase according to manufacture

233

recommendation. Amplified products were purified using 1.0 X ratio of Agencourt AMPure XP beads

234

(Beckman Coulter) and quantified with Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer by using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit

235

(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina) following

236

manufacturer’s instructions was used for Library preparation and indexing. The sequencing library was

237

quantified using Qubit 2.0 (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and average size was determined by 4200

238

TapeStation using the D5000 ScreenTape assay (Agilent Technologies, US). The library was

239

normalized to 4 nMol and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform, using Illumina MiSeq reagent kit

240

v2 (2 × 150 bp), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. CLC Genomics Workbench version 8.0.1

241

(CLC bio, Germantown, MD, USA) was used for both reference assembly and de novo assembly.

specific primers producing short amplicon covering entire genome. Briefly, cDNA synthesis and

244

amplicon generation using 2 individual pools of primers was done according to the published

245

protocol29. The two pools of amplicons were combined together and cleaned by Agencourt AMPure XP

246

beads (Beckman Coulter) prior to library preparation using Nextera XT (Illumina) following the

247

manufacturer protocol except that half volume of the reagent was used throughout the protocol.

248

Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) in ratio of 1.0 were used for the final purification step

249

followed by measurement by Qubit 2.0 and average size determination, using 2200 TapeStation

(Agilent Technologies, USA). All libraries were manually normalized to 4 nMol. Libraries were

combined in equal volumes for denaturation and subsequent dilution according to MiSeq protocol

252

recommended by manufacturer.

254

Molecular evolution

255

A total of 2,803 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained from GISAID (downloaded on March 30th

256

2020). Initial quality filtering was performed by iteratively removing redundant sequences with 100%

257

nucleotide identity, having less than 2,940 informative positions, and lacking informative sampling

258

dates. The resulting 2,017 curated sequences were aligned using mafft 30 (v7.450: --retree 2 –maxiterate

259

2 –auto settings), and unaligned ends and gap positions from the resulting alignment were removed

260

using Geneious (version R10.2.6, https://www.geneious.com). A Maximum-likelihood tree was

261

constructed using IQTree31 (v1.6.1: -model HKY) and used for identification and removal of highly

262

divergent sequences with Treetime32 (clock setting). Following previous recommendations (adapted

263

from http://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473)33 to account for regions

264

which might potentially be the result of hypervariability or sequencing artifacts, alignment positions

265

showing significant homoplasy were first identified using Treetime (homoplasy setting). Top-10

266

significant homoplastic positions were merged from three separate analyses, using all sequences from

267

the initial alignment, and sequence subsets generated using Illumina (1,450 samples) or Nanopore (341

268

samples) sequencing technologies. Next, recombinant clusters of mutations were identified with

269

ConalFrameML34. Identified positions were masked using a custom-written python script, and further

270

filtered for sequences with 100% nucleotide identity, resulting in an alignment of 1,225 sequences.

271

Finally, to reduce sampling bias only one sample per country was kept for date of sampling, leading to

272

442 sequences. Molecular dating analysis was performed by the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

273

method implemented by Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis on Sampling Trees (BEAST) 1.10.4 35. A

274

HKY85 nucleotide substitution model was used. Fixed and relaxed molecular clock models were fitted,

and constant population size was compared with exponential population growth. All models were run

276

using default priors except for the exponential growth rate (Laplace distribution) in which scale was set

277

to 100. The chain length was set to 100 million states and burn-in of 10 million. Convergence was

278

checked with Tracer 1.7.136. Based on ESS values, estimates for tMRCA of the European Clade spike

279

protein mutation and root age are reported under the strict molecular clock and constant population

280

growth (ESSs > 900). The resulting coalescent tree was generated using TreeAnnotator 37 and visualized

281

using ggtree package38 in R version 3.6.1 (https://www.r-project.org/).

282
283

Structural analyses

284

Visualization, analysis and in silico mutations of protein structures were done in UCSF Chimera 18.

285

First, we downloaded the molecular structure of the spike protein from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).

286

This structure corresponds to that resolved by Wrapp and colleagues 19 and deposited in PDB with

287

identifier number 6vsb. We replaced the aspartate residue in position 614 by glycine using the

288

“Rotamers” function in Chimera with default parameters. Then, inter-atomic contacts of both residues

289

at position 614 were derived with the CSU package19 freely available at http://oca.weizmann.ac.il/oca-

290

bin/lpccsu.

Figure 3. Structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein around position 614. (A) Location and
distribution of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. The full trimeric form of the spike protein results from a
complex of three identical spike monomers (right panel). (B) Three-dimensional depiction of a spike
protein monomer. The receptor-binding domain is colored purple and the location of the aspartate
residue in position 614 is highlighted in green. (C) Inter-atomic contacts between aspartate 614 (green)
in a reference spike monomer (blue) and four residues (pink) in its adjacent spike protein monomer
chain (white). These four contacts are destabilizing and create a hydrophilic-hydrophobic repelling
effect that is lost upon replacement of aspartate by glycine in the D614G mutation (see Table 1). (D)
Spatial distribution of aspartate 614 residue (green) and an adjacent glycosylated asparagine residue in
position 616 (orange). The two residues point in opposite directions and thus it is unlikely they share a
meaningful interaction.
