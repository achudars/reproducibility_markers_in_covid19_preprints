Abstract – 144 words
SARS-CoV-2, the agent responsible for COVID-19 has been shown to infect a number of

17

species. The role of domestic livestock and the risk associated for humans in close contact

18

remains unknown for many production animals. Determination of the susceptibility of pigs to

19

SARS-CoV-2 is critical towards a One Health approach to manage the potential risk of zoonotic

20

transmission. Here, pigs undergoing experimental inoculation are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 at

21

low levels. Viral RNA was detected in group oral fluids and nasal wash from at least two animals

22

while live virus was isolated from a pig. Further, antibodies could be detected in two animals at

23

11 and 13 days post infection, while oral fluid samples at 6 days post inoculation indicated the

24

presence of secreted antibodies. These data highlight the need for additional livestock assessment

25

to better determine the potential role domestic animals may contribute towards the SARS-CoV-2

26

pandemic.

Introduction

30

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent of

31

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was recently identified to cause severe respiratory distress in

32

humans with symptoms ranging from asymptomatic, mild to severe, and sometimes fatal cases

33

(1). Rapidly spreading, this novel virus emerged in Wuhan China, to generate a pandemic as

34

declared by the World Health Organization on March, 11th 2020 (2). Predicted to have

35

originated in bats, SARS-CoV-2 origins are still under intense investigation as reports continue

36

to identify the ability of the virus to infect new animal species (3-8). Detection of natural

37

infections has recently shed light on knowledge gaps in understanding transmission which has

38

raised concerns regarding amplifying or reservoir hosts. In turn, a better understanding of

39

wildlife and domestic animal susceptibility is required to assess the potential roles and present

40

risks to prevent future spread of disease. Domestic swine, one of the most significant and highly

41

produced agricultural species with previous impacts to public health, must be assessed (9-12).

42

The increase in “backyard” small stakeholder animal production in both rural and urban

43

environments provides an important source of high-quality protein and income, but can also

44

serve as a source for zoonotic disease; therefore, it is important to investigate their potential role

45

during SARS-CoV-2 spread (13). Evidence for the involvement of production animals was

46

recently highlighted in The Netherlands where anthroponotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from

47

humans to farmed mink with subsequent zoonotic transmission to at least two humans from mink

48

has been proposed, further exemplifying the need to identify the potential role of production

49

animals in disease transmission (14).

50
51

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified to be the receptor for
SARS-CoV-2 (15). A Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) query of the protein

52

database using translated nucleotide (BLASTx) from the human ACE2 coding sequence predicts

53

98% coverage and 81% identity for the homologous receptor in swine. Interestingly, using the

54

same search both mink (82%) and feline (85%) show similar identity to the human ACE2 for

55

their cognate receptors. Moreover, both mink and cats have been reported to be susceptible to

56

SARS-CoV-2 and have shown transmission to other animals (5, 16). Work by Zhou et al.

57

utilized in vitro infectivity studies testing ACE2 receptor from laboratory mice, horseshoe bats,

58

civets and the domestic pig. All of the respective receptors, except mice, were reported to enter

59

HeLa cells indicating a functional target for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the authors employed

60

additional known coronavirus receptors including both aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl

61

peptidase 4 finding neither are used for cell entry outlining the specificity for the ACE2 receptor

62

(17).

63

The work reported here aims to determine whether domestic swine are susceptible to

64

SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing critical information to aid public health risk assessments.

65

Following oronasal inoculation, swine were assessed for: clinical signs and pathology, evidence

66

of virus shedding, viral dissemination within tissues, and seroconversion. The data presented in

67

this study provides evidence live SARS-CoV-2 virus can persist in swine for at least 13 days

68

following experimental inoculation.

guidelines. Group housing was carried out in the BSL-3zoonotic large animal cubicles, and

76

animals were provided with commercial toys for enrichment and access to food and water ad

77

libitum. All invasive procedures, including experimental inoculation and sample collection (nasal

78

washes, rectal swabs, and blood collection) were performed under isoflurane gas anesthesia, and

79

animals were euthanized by intravenous administration of a commercial sodium pentobarbital

80

solution.

81
82

Study design. Nineteen domestic, American Yorkshire crossbred pigs (Sus scrufa) (6

83

castrated males and 13 females, age 8 weeks) were locally sourced in Manitoba, Canada and

84

utilized in this study. Sixteen pigs were oronasally challenged with 1 X 106 pfu per animal in a

85

total of 3 mL DMEM under sedation with isoflurane. 1 ml was distributed per nostril and 1ml

86

placed in the distal pharynx utilizing a sterile, tomcat-style catheter. The challenge dose was

87

confirmed by back-titration of the inoculum on Vero E6 cells. Two naïve pigs were placed in the

88

room with the inoculated pigs at day 10 to serve as in-room transmission controls. One additional

89

uninoculated pig was sampled and necropsied to serve as a “farm control” providing negative

90

control tissues. A physical examination including collection of blood, multiple swabs (rectal,

91

oral, and nasal), and nasal wash with sterile D-PBS was performed at day zero and every other

92

day beginning at three days post-inoculation (DPI) until day 15. The remaining pigs were

93

sampled on 22 and 29 DPI. Group oral fluids from rope chews were collected daily. Necropsies

94

and post-mortem sampling were performed starting at 3 DPI as outlined in Table 1. Animal

95

numbers were not based on power analysis but on the limitations of the containment animal

96

room size and requirements of CCAC guidelines. Group assignment (day of euthanasia and

97

necropsy) was based on randomization at the time of permanent animal identification (ear tag).

Sampling of animals. Oral, rectal, and nasal swabs were taken from each pig under general

100

anesthesia using isoflurane and placed into sterile D-PBS containing the following antibiotics:

101

streptomycin, vancomycin, nystatin, and gentamycin. Fluid was collected from a bilateral nasal

102

wash using sterile D-PBS. Blood was collected in each of the following via jugular venipuncture:

103

serum, sodium citrate, sodium heparin, and K3 EDTA.

104
105

Hematology, chemistry, and blood gas analyses. Hematology was performed on an HM5

106

analyzer (Abaxis) using K3 EDTA-treated whole blood and the following parameters were

107

evaluated: red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular

108

hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red cell distribution weight, platelets,

109

mean platelet volume, white blood cells, neutrophil count (absolute (abs) and %), lymphocyte

110

count (abs and %), monocyte count (abs and %), eosinophil count (abs and %), and basophil

111

count (abs and %). Blood chemistries were evaluated on a VetScan 2 (Abaxis) with the

112

Comprehensive Diagnostic Profile rotor (Abaxis) using serum stored at -80˚C until tested and the

113

following parameters were evaluated: glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, albumin,

114

total protein, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase,

115

amylase, potassium, sodium, phosphate, chloride, globulin, and total bilirubin. Sodium heparin

116

treated blood was used to analyze venous blood gases, which were performed on an iSTAT

117

Alinity V machine (Abaxis) using a CG4+ cartridge (Abaxis) to measure the following

118

parameters: lactate, pH, total carbon dioxide, partial pressure carbon dioxide, partial pressure

119

oxygen, soluble oxygen, bicarbonate, and base excess. Age-specific values were utilized to

120

establish normal ranges along with the machine reference intervals (18-20).

Cells and virus. Second passage of SARS-CoV-2 (generously provided by the Public Health

145

Agency of Canada, hCoV-19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020) was propagated on Vero E6 cells in

146

DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS. Virus was titrated by plaque assay and viral isolation was

147

performed as previously described (21, 22).

148
149

Tissue homogenization and virus isolation. Pre-weighed, frozen tissue sections in Precellys

150

bead mill tubes were thawed and D- PBS was added to make 10% w/v tissue homogenates.

151

Tubes were processed using a Bertin Minilys personal tissue homogenizer and clarified by

152

centrifugation at 2000 xg. Clarified homogenates, swabs and fluids collected from experimental

153

animals were inactivated with TriPure Reagent (Roche) and extracted in duplicate as described

154

below. Semi-quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) positive samples were tested for virus

155

isolation through standard plaque assay on VE6 cells using freshly prepared homogenates of

156

frozen tissue.

Serum Neutralization Assays. Neutralizing antibody titers in sera were determined via

204

plaque reduction neutralization test against SARS-CoV-2. Serial five-fold dilutions of heat

205

inactivated (30 min at 56°C) sera were incubated with virus for 1 hour at 37°C. Each virus-serum

206

mixture was then added to duplicate wells of Vero E6 cells in a 48-well format, incubated for 1

207

hour at 37°C, and overlaid with 500 μl of 2.0% carboxymethylcellulose in DMEM per well.

208

Plates were then incubated at 37°C for 72 hours, fixed with 10% buffered formalin, and stained

209

with 0.5% crystal violet. Serum dilutions resulting in >70% reduction of plaque counts compared

210

to virus controls were considered positive for virus neutralization.

Surrogate virus Neutralization Test. Detection and semi-quantitation of neutralizing

213

antibodies was determined using SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test Kit

214

(Genscript, Cat. No.: L00847). Testing of sera was performed as outlined in the manufacturer’s

215

instructions. All sera were assessed from 7 DPI through 29 DPI including archived negative sera

216

and kit-supplied negative controls. Neutralization was determined positive when above the

217

recommended 20% cutoff.

Results
Experimental inoculation of sixteen eight week old swine was performed oronasally with

221

1 X 106 pfu of SARS-CoV-2, distributed evenly between both nostrils and the distal pharynx.

222

Starting at 1 day post inoculation (DPI), pigs developed a mild, bilateral ocular discharge and in

223

some cases, this was accompanied by serous nasal secretion. This was observed for only the first

224

three days post inoculation. Temperatures remained normal throughout the study (Table S1).

225

Overall, animals did not develop clinically observable respiratory distress, however one animal

226

(Pig 20-06) presented mild depression at 1 DPI accompanied with a cough which was maintained

227

through 4 DPI. This animal did not display additional clinical signs over the course of the study.

228
229

Viral shedding was evaluated to identify potential transmission which may occur through

230

droplets from coughing, sneezing, oral fluids or gastrointestinal involvement. A sampling

231

schedule was developed with the goal of determining the incidence of viral shedding (Table 1).

232

Every other day starting at 3 DPI to 15 DPI, oral, nasal, and rectal swabs were sampled to

233

evaluate the potential for delayed onset (1). Nucleic acid was extracted from swabs and RT-

234

qPCR was performed to identify SARS-CoV-2 by targeting the envelope gene (E gene). Viral

235

RNA could not be detected in swabs from any animals over the course of the study (Table 2, A).

236

Nasal washes are a sensitive method for detection of pathogens in swine and were routinely

237

sampled using sterile D-PBS to rinse nasal passages. Two pigs (20-10, 20-11) displayed low

238

levels of viral RNA by RT-qPCR at 3 DPI (Table 2, A). Recovery of live virus was attempted for

239

both PCR-positive nasal wash samples, however neither produced cytopathic effect or increased

240

RNA detection via RT-qPCR of the cell culture supernatent. A third method for the detection of

241

viral shedding was performed using a non-invasive, group sampling method. A cotton rope was

242

hung on the pen prior to feeding which allows for deposit of oral fluids. Daily fluids from ropes

243

were processed, with one room (Table 1, Cubicle 1) a weak positive signal for viral RNA at 3

244

DPI by RT-qPCR. Virus isolation was attempted from this sample, but similar to nasal washes,

245

virus was not successfully isolated. It is important to note the positive oral fluid from cubicle 1 is

246

not from the same room as the two positive nasal washes generated from Pigs 20-10 and 20-11

247

as the later were in different animal cubicles. Therefore, at minimum three animals provide

248

evidence of viral nucleic acid in oronasal secretions from two independent animal rooms. Of

249

note, two naïve pigs were introduced to the infected pigs at 10 DPI as transmission contacts,

250

however no indication of viral infection could be detected from these animals at any point during

251

the study.

252
253

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 was also attempted from whole blood by RT-qPCR, following

254

the sampling schedule outlined in Table 1. As outlined in Table 2A, viremia, as indicated by the

255

presence of viral RNA in the blood, could not be detected in any animal throughout the study.

256

Blood cell counts, chemistries, and gasses were measured using the Abaxis HM5, VetScan 2, and

257

iSTAT respectively. Although some variation was observed throughout the study, changes were

258

minimal and inconclusive, and profiles consistent with acute viral infection or subsequent organ

259

damage were not observed.

260
261

To identify potential target tissues or gross lesions consistent with SARS-CoV-2 disease,

262

necropsy was performed on two animals starting at 3 DPI and every other day up to day 15; with

263

an additional two pigs necropsied at both 22 and 29 DPI (Table 1). No significant pathology was

264

observed which could be directly attributed to a viral infection. RT-qPCR was performed across

265

all tissues and samples collected at necropsy targeting the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2, C).

266

One tissue, the submandibular lymph node tested from Pig 20-06 necropsied at 13 DPI was

267

positive for viral RNA. The tissue sample was repeated in triplicate, on independent days,

268

generating consistent results. Further, RNA was extracted from homogenized tissue and full

269

genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was recovered. A 10% homogenate was generated from the

270

submandibular lymph node and used to infect Vero E6 cells. Aliquots were taken from cell

271

culture at 2DPI and 3DPI to monitor viral replication as indicated by an increasing quantity of

272

RNA. Mild CPE was observed by 3DPI in the first passage with an increase in viral RNA

273

measured by RT-qPCR targeting the envelope, spike and RNA dependent RNA polymerase

274

genes. The first passage supernatant was clarified by centrifugation and passaged a second time

275

in Vero E6 cells. At 2DPI of the second passage, significant CPE was exhibited in addition to

276

increasing copies of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA confirmed by RT-qPCR. Together this

277

demonstrated the presence of live, replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus isolated form the

278

submandibular lymph node of Pig 20-06 (Table 2).

280

The development of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were monitored over the

281

course of study. Starting at 7 DPI, serum was obtained from individual animals for both virus

282

neutralization test (traditional VNT) and a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT; Genscript).

283

Sera was first tested using a traditional VNT, with one pig (20-07) generating neutralizing

284

antibody titers, albeit weak, at a 1:5 dilution with a 70% reduction of plaques at both 13 and 15

285

DPI (Table 3). Consequently, the sVNT assay identified the same animal, Pig 20-07, as antibody

286

positive with 0.188 µg/ml antibody at 15 DPI. A second pig (20-14) was shown to have

287

generated antibody at 11 DPI (0.113 µg/ml) and 13 DPI (0.224 µg/ml). The sVNT was also

288

employed to identify secreted antibody in oral fluids throughout the study. Interestingly, at 6 DPI

289

we detected positive antibody (0.133 µg/ml) from group oral fluid collected from cubicle 1

290

(Table 3).

Discussion
The results presented in this study define domestic swine as a susceptible species albeit at

294

low levels to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. One animal was found to retain live virus, while two

295

additional animals had detectible RNA measured in the nasal wash, and two pigs developed

296

antibodies. In total, of the sixteen animals experimentally inoculated, five displayed some level

297

of exposure or elicited an immune response to the virus, representing roughly 30% of the study

298

cohort. One pig displayed mild, non-specific clinical signs, including coughing and depression in

299

addition to multiple pigs demonstrating mild ocular and nasal discharge. These signs occurred

300

during what could be considered to be the immediate, post-infection period. Over a nine day

301

period, between cessation of clinical signs and post mortem evaluation, the virus was found to be

302

maintained undetected in the submandibular lymph node in this animal. Importantly, of the five

303

animals indicated potential infection, viral RNA was only detected at low levels and no live viral

304

shedding was identified.

305
306

Following the detection of viral RNA in group oral fluids collected by rope chews at 3

307

DPI, the presence of secreted antibody was detected using a surrogate virus neutralization test

308

(sVNT) at 6 DPI in the same sample type. The amount of antibody measured in oral fluids from

309

swine would be considered below a protective cutoff based on comparisons to classical

310

neutralizing titers, however the discovery of secreted antibody in oral fluids may be a useful tool

311

for surveillance efforts. This also demonstrates the possibility that human saliva should be

312

evaluated as a less invasive method to provide accompanying evidence with serosurveillance

313

studies for exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

314
315

The results of this study contradict previous reports indicating swine are not susceptible

316

to SARS-CoV-2 infection (4, 25). RNA was not detected in swabs or organ samples and no

317

seroconversion was measured in these studies. Infectious dose, viral isolate, age, and breed or

318

colony of swine may affect study outcomes. It should be noted in this work, a ten-fold higher

319

viral dose was utilized for experimental infection compared to previous studies. Moreover,

320

animals were obtained from a high health status farm in Manitoba, in contrast to a specific

321

pathogen free colony, for the purpose of determining the risk to Canadian pigs. Altogether, these

322

findings indicate that further investigations into the susceptibility of additional domestic

323

livestock species should be studied to assess their risk. Finally, we emphasize that no cases of

324

domestic livestock have been documented by natural infection to date; however, the results of

326

and spread of SARS-CoV-2.
