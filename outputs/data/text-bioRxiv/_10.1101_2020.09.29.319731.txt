Synopsis:

24

Background: SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and a pathogen of immense

25

global public health importance. Development of innovative direct-acting antiviral agents is

26

sorely needed to address this virus. Peptide-conjugated morpholino oligomers (PPMO) are

27

antisense agents composed of a phosphordiamidate morpholino oligomer covalently conjugated

28

to a cell-penetrating peptide. PPMO require no delivery assistance to enter cells and are able to

29

reduce expression of targeted RNA through sequence-specific steric blocking.

30

Objectives and Methods: Five PPMO designed against sequences of genomic RNA in the

31

SARS-CoV-2 5’-untranslated region and a negative control PPMO of random sequence were

32

synthesized. Each PPMO was evaluated for its effect on the viability of uninfected cells and its

33

inhibitory effect on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cell cultures. Cell viability was

34

evaluated with an ATP-based method and viral growth was measured with quantitative RT-PCR

35

and TCID50 infectivity assays.

36

Results: PPMO designed to base-pair with sequence in the 5’-terminal region or the leader

37

transcription regulatory sequence-region of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA were highly

38

efficacious, reducing viral titers by up to 4-6 log10 in cell cultures at 48-72 hours post-infection,

39

in a non-toxic and dose-responsive manner.

40

Conclusion: The data indicate that PPMO have the ability to potently and specifically suppress

41

SARS-CoV-2 growth and are promising candidates for further pre-clinical development.

Introduction:

44

There is a pressing need for the development of additional antiviral therapeutics to address

45

SARS-CoV-2 infections. Peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers

46

(PPMO) are single-stranded-nucleic acid analogs capable of entering cells without assistance and

47

interfering with gene expression through steric blockade of targeted RNA. PPMO are composed

48

of a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) covalently conjugated to a cell-

49

penetrating peptide (CPP)[1-3]. PPMO are water-soluble, nuclease resistant and non-toxic at

50

effective concentrations across a range of in vitro and in vivo applications [1, 4]. In several in

51

vivo models of respiratory viruses, including influenza A virus[5, 6], respiratory syncytial virus

52

[7]and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus[8], intranasally administered PPMO

53

targeted against virus sequence have reduced viral titer and pathology in lung tissue.

54

The 5’UTR of the coronavirus genome contains sequences and structures known to be important

55

in various aspects of the virus life-cycle including translation and RNA synthesis [9]. In previous

56

studies, PPMO targeted to various sites in the 5’UTR of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [10, 11]

57

and SARS-CoV [12] were effectively antiviral. In the present study we investigated the ability of

58

five PPMO targeted against various sites in the 5’UTR and polyprotein 1a/b translation start site

59

(AUG) region of SARS-CoV-2 to suppress virus growth in cell cultures. We found that PPMO

60

targeting the 5’terminal region and the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS)-leader region of

61

genomic RNA were potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication.

62

Materials and Methods:

63

Biosafety. Work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 was approved by the Institutional Biosafety

64

Committee (IBC) and performed in high biocontainment at Rocky Mountain Laboratories

65

(RML), NIAID, NIH. Sample removal from high biocontainment followed IBC-approved

66

Standard Operating Protocols.

67

PPMO synthesis. PPMO were synthesized by covalently conjugating the CPP (RXR)4 (where R

68

is arginine and X is 6-aminohexanoic acid) to PMO (Gene Tools LLC, Philomath, Oregon) at

69

the 3’ end through a noncleavable linker, by methods described previously [3].

70

Cells and viruses. Vero-E6 cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10%

71

fetal calf serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 μg/mL streptomycin (growth

72

medium). All cell culture incubations were carried out at 37º C and 5% CO2. SARS-CoV-2

73

isolate nCoV-WA1-2020 was kindly provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

74

(Atlanta, Georgia, USA). Preparation and quantification of the virus followed methods

75

previously described[13]. Briefly, the original virus stock was propagated once at RML in Vero-

76

E6 cells in DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum containing L-glutamine and

77

antibiotics as above (infection medium). The virus stock used in the experiments was passage 4

78

and was confirmed by sequencing to be identical to the initial deposited GenBank sequence

79

MN985325.

80

Cell viability assay. Cell viability was assessed using CellTiterGlo (Promega). Vero E6 cells

81

grown in 96-well plates were incubated in the presence of PPMO in growth media for 48 hours,

82

then assayed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Statistical analysis was carried out

83

using GraphPad Prizm (San Diego, CA).

84

Antiviral assays. PPMO were resuspended in sterile PBS. Vero-E6 cells were plated in 48 well

85

plates and were approximately 80% confluent on the day of infection. At 5 hrs before infection,

86

the growth medium was removed and replaced with infection medium containing PPMO. For

87

viral infections, the PPMO-containing medium was aspirated and the cells rinsed twice with

88

DMEM before adding 100 µl of infection medium containing virus at a MOI of .01. Following a

89

one hour infection period, the virus-containing inoculum was aspirated and the cells washed

90

twice with infection medium after which 300 µl fresh infection medium was added. At 12, 24, 48

91

and 72 hours post-infection (pi), all of the media in a well was collected for qRT-PCR and

92

TCID50 analysis.

93

Evaluation of virus quantity by qRT-PCR. Supernatants were harvested as described above

94

and viral RNA purified and quantified by using one-step quantitative reverse transcription PCR

95

(qRT-PCR) following previous described methods [13]. Briefly, total RNA was isolated with the

96

RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and RT-PCR carried out using the One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen)

97

according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Copy numbers were calculated using standards

98

produced as previously described [13].

99

TCID50 evaluations. Viral supernatants were serially diluted in DMEM and each dilution

100

sample was titrated in triplicate. Subsequently, 100 ul of each virus dilution was transferred to

101

Vero-E6 cells grown in 96-well plates containing 100ul DMEM. Following a seven day

102

incubation period, wells were scored for cytopathic effect (CPE). The TCID50 values were

103

calculated via the Reed-Muench formula.

Results:

106

PPMO design. PPMO design was guided by previous studies in which various Nidoviruses were

107

targeted with PPMO [10-12, 14, 15]. In this study, five PPMO were designed to target the 5’ UTR

108

and first translation start site-region of SARS-CoV-2 positive sense genomic RNA (Table 1). Two

109

of the PPMO target the 5’-terminal-region of the genome. Both 5’END-1 and 5’END-2 were

110

designed with the intention of interfering with pre-initiation of translation of genomic and

111

subgenomic mRNAs.

112

Two PPMO were designed to target the genomic 5’UTR region containing the putative SARS-

113

CoV-2 leader-TRS core sequence (nt 70-75, 5’-ACGAAC-3’) and thereby potentially interfere

114

with body-TRS to leader-TRS base-pairing, and/or with translocation of the 48S translation

115

preinitiation complex along the 5’UTR of the genomic and various subgenomic mRNAs.

116

Coronaviruses produce a set of nested mRNAs through the process of discontinuous subgenomic

117

mRNA synthesis. The TRS is a six-ten nt sequence that is critical in the production of negative

118

strand mRNA templates during this process [16, 17]. For SARS-CoV, the leader-TRS core

119

sequence consists of nt 67-72 of the genomic RNA sequence[18], and most viral mRNAs possess

120

the same 72 nt 5’ leader sequence.

121

The AUG PPMO was designed to target the translation initiation region for ORF1a/b, which codes

122

for the replicase polyprotein, with the intention to block translation initiation.

123

A negative control PPMO (NC) of random sequence was included (see Table 1), to control for

124

nonspecific effects of the PPMO chemistry. NC was screened using BLAST and contains little

125

significant homology to any primate, rodent or viral sequences.

126

Evaluation of PPMO cytotoxicity. To evaluate the effect of PPMO treatments on cell viability,

127

cells were treated under similar conditions to the antiviral assays described below, but in the

128

absence of virus. Cells were treated in triplicate with increasing doses of PPMO for 48 hours before

129

being assayed using a quantitative cell viability assay. At the concentrations used in the antiviral

130

assays described below, none of the PPMO produced more than 5% cytotoxic effect (Figure 1A).

131

Evaluation of PPMO antiviral activity. To determine the inhibitory activity of the various

132

PPMO on SARS-CoV-2 replication, Vero-E6 cells were treated with each of the six PPMO

133

described in Table 1 at 4, 8, and 16 µM for 5 hours before infection, then incubated without

134

PPMO after infection. Cell supernatants were collected at four time-points post-infection: 12, 24,

135

48, and 72 hours. Virus growth was evaluated by two methods, qRT-PCR and TCID50 infectivity

136

assay. Using an MOI of 0.01, virus growth rose steadily and reached peak growth at 72 hrs post-

137

infection (Fig. 1B and H). Growth of the virus under PBS treatment was highly similar to virus

138

growth under NC PPMO treatment (data not shown). Four of the five PPMO designed to target

139

SARS-CoV-2 RNA were highly effective, suppressing viral titers by 3-5 log10 at the 48 and 72

140

hr time-points (Figure 1B-M). qPCR analysis showed that in cells treated with 8 or 16 µM of

141

any of the four PPMO targeting the 5’end- or TRS-regions, virus growth was markedly

142

suppressed at 12-48 hrs post-infection. The number of cycles required to detect virus from those

143

samples was approximately the same as the number of cycles required to detect the input virus

144

shortly after infection. At 72 hrs post-infection, the efficacy of the 5’END- and TRS-PPMO had

145

waned, to a minor extent, although still providing multi-log suppression of virus growth. The

146

AUG PPMO was not nearly as effective as the other 4 antiviral PPMO used in this study (Figure

147

1C and I).

148

Discussion:

149

We found that PPMO targeting the 5’terminal-region or leader-TRS-region were highly effective

150

at inhibiting the growth of SARS-CoV-2, whereas a PPMO targeting the polyprotein 1a/b AUG

151

translation start site region was not effective. It is unknown if the ineffective AUG-PPMO was

152

unable to bind to its target, or if duplexing occurred yet was relatively inconsequential.

153

To date, little sequence variation in the PPMO target sites in the 5’UTR of SARS-CoV-2 has

154

been identified. Of the whole-genome nucleotide sequences reported in GenBank, two genotypes

155

contain a single mismatch with the 5’END PPMO and one genome has a single mismatch with

156

the TRS PPMO[19]. Previous studies have shown that PPMO having a single base mismatch

157

with their target site retain approximately 90% of their activity compared to those having perfect

158

agreement [15, 20].

159

This study demonstrates that PPMO targeted against SARS-CoV-2 can enter cells readily and

160

inhibit viral replication in a sequence-specific, dose-responsive and non-toxic manner.

161

Considering the considerable in vivo antiviral efficacy demonstrated by PPMO against several

162

respiratory viruses in previous studies [5-8], further development of the 5’END- and TRS-PPMO

163

appears warranted.
