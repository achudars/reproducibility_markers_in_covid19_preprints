Abstract
Many government websites and mobile content are inaccessible for people with vision, hearing, and
cognitive disabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted these disparities when health authority
website information, critical in providing resources for curbing the spread of the virus, remained
inaccessible for disabled populations. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines provide comparatively
universally accepted guidelines for website accessibility. We utilized these parameters to examine the
number of countries with or without accessible health authority websites. The resulting data indicate
a dearth of countries with websites accessible for persons with disabilities. Methods of information
dissemination must take into consideration individuals with disabilities, particularly in times of global
health crises.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging the boundaries of not only social behaviors and cultural
institutions, but also the rapid and accurate dissemination of information. The containment of this
epidemic has required stringent adherence to interpersonal behavioral modifications, which are often
developed and transmitted by national health authorities. However, national health authority
websites may lack website accommodations for people with vision, hearing, physical, or cognitive
impairments. Minimizing the information gap between able-bodied and disabled populations is
imperative for achieving global engagement in containing not only COVID-19, but also future
pandemics. We sought to determine what percentage of national health authority websites are fully
accessible to people with disabilities according to Web Content Accessibility (WCAG 2.1) guidelines
(W3C, 2020a) benchmarks. Our research demonstrates that only a small percentage of government
health websites are fully accessible for people with disabilities.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 2.2 billion people suffer from
vision impairment or blindness (WHO Blindness and vision impairment, 2019), while 466 million
people have a disabling hearing loss (WHO Deafness and hearing loss, 2020). Individuals with
temporary or permanent motor or cognitive disabilities also require accessibility modifications for
proper interaction with websites. Inconsistent heading level and font size or color contrast of elements
in webpages harbor barriers for proper interaction by visually impaired people. Likewise, alternative
textual descriptions of visual elements on a page are essential for contextual understanding, in
addition to proper interaction with text-to-speech engines. Lack of video content subtitles or
transcripts present barriers to the hearing impaired. Compatibility with keyboard navigation, including
skip linking in the backend of a website, is crucial to accommodate web navigation for people with
motor dysfunction who interact with a single finger or with other motor gestures.

Materials and methods
The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), launched and endorsed by the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) (W3C, 2020b), established a set of guidelines according to four accessibility principles: whether
the website is Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. Each WCAG 2.1 principle has a set
of testable criteria with a total number of 78 testable success criteria. Each success criteria is assigned
to one of three conformance levels: A (lowest), AA (intermediate), and AAA (highest). The adherence
to higher levels of conformance has been shown to improve accessibility for both disabled and nondisabled users (Loiacono and Djamasbi, 2013; Ruth-Janneck, 2011; Schmutz et al., 2016). A panoply of
web accessibility evaluation plug-ins was developed under open-source license for the systematic
evaluation of website accessibility against the WCAG 2.1 criteria (W3C, 2020a). A list of available tools
is presented by the W3C website without an official recommendation for usage of one tool above

another (W3C, 2020c). These automated tools aim to complement the cardinal manual check of a
website during the development process and throughout routine website updates to ensure maximal
adherence WCAG guidelines (Petrie and Bevan, 2009). A comprehensive comparison between eight
widely used accessibility evaluation tools highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each tool and
recommends using more than one tool for optimal coverage of success criteria (Frazão and Duarte,
2020). Hence, to test the accessibility of COVID-19 information disseminated through health authority
websites, we utilized two independent accessibility evaluation engine including WAVE chrome
extension (wave.webaim.org) and Accessibility Insights (accessibilityinsights.io), both of which have
been described and utilized in previous literature (Acosta-Vargas et al., 2020; Frazão and Duarte,
2020). The WAVE tool analyzes 180 checks according to two conformances level (152 level A; 28 level
AA); whereas the Accessibility Insights tool analyzes 64 checks according to three conformances level
(55 level A; 7 level AA; and 2 level AAA) (Frazão and Duarte, 2020). It must be noted that the weight
of each error (e.g. minor, moderate, critical) is defined by the tool developer and thus may result in
different impacts on the overall accessibility rank of the page results.
Due to the rapid growth of COVID-19 information and the frequent updates of health
authorities’ websites, which may influence the accessibility score at a given time point, the degree of
accessibility of each website was evaluated at three different time points and the presented data refer
to the following three consecutive days (5-7 April, 2020). The calculated number of errors of each
health authority homepage augments the average number of errors in each test separately (WAVE
and Accessibility Insights), with removal of redundant errors represented in both tests.
In addition to accessibility assessments, we tested each website for mobile usability in
concordance to Google webmaster developer tools (developers.google.com). In this regard, previous
studies have demonstrated that mobile-friendliness of a given website contributes not only to end
user usability, but also for website visibility on search engine results (Schubert, 2016).
The list of health authorities' websites of 189 countries were drawn from The Geneva
Foundation for Medical Education and Research (GFMER, 2020) (Supplementary Table 1). Prior to
accessibility evaluation, a manual check of each website on the list yielded 174 health authority
websites. Websites of 15 countries were excluded due to an inability to load the site on the test server
or when the official health authority homepage appeared as a social media page. This was a crosssectional study concentrating on the accessibility of health authorities' websites’ homepages (unit of
analysis) providing health information and recommended public protective measures against COVID19.

Results
Only 4.7% of the countries examined had fully implemented the WAI accessibility guidelines: Italy, the
Netherlands, Norway, Japan, Poland, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States (Figure
1). In contrast, sites from the majority of countries continue to have accessibility errors that present
significant barriers to people with disabilities around the world. Distribution of reported errors across
all 174 tested health authorities’ homepages, according to WCAG conformance levels, reveals that
89% violate Level A criteria, while 11% of countries contain errors that violate higher levels of success
criteria (AA and AAA). Inspection of the numbers of errors on all tested pages grouped by WCAG
principles indicate that the most impacted principles are robustness (39%) and perceptibility (32%),
as compared to operability (19%) and understandability (10%). While both error number,
conformance, and principle distribution may be altered according to the selected assessment tools,
the data collected signifies the insufficient implementation of WCAG guidelines in the majority of
health authority websites, rendering accessibility barriers to millions of people.

Discussion
Reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 depends on tight adherence of the public to simple but
challenging modifications in social and public behavior (Chu et al., 2020). Digital media provide
numerous platforms to distribute essential information to the public through websites, social media,
and instant messaging applications (Jung and Shin, 2020).
Due to the diversity of reporting sources and the harmful consequences of disinformation (Islam
et al., 2020), governments often encourage the public to check local health authority websites
frequently for regular updates. This demand requires the information on official websites to be
accessible to as many citizens as possible. Unfortunately, individuals with the greatest need for timely
and precise data may have the most difficulty accessing governmental material (West and Miller,
2006). Providing consistently high-quality government productions could also lead to a greater
utilization of the Internet by persons with disabilities. Enhancing accessibility to governmentsponsored resources could lead not only to immediate population benefits but could also promote
the position of disabled people in the digital sphere through increased communication, global
engagement, and visibility.
Despite remarkable technological advancements in recent history, for people with visual,
hearing, motor and cognitive disabilities, a seemingly simple website interaction can present a
daunting challenge. Although internet access is still unavailable to approximately one-third of the
world’s population, the needs of all existing users must be accommodated to ensure equal benefits
and access to essential health information. The growth and expansion of the Internet must therefore
be accompanied by an equal development of sophisticated accessibility technologies, which would
expand the usability of the web to individuals with disabilities. Without underestimating the
importance of accessibility implementation during normal times, the current COVID-19 pandemic now
highlights just how important unhindered access to government websites is during a global health
crisis.
