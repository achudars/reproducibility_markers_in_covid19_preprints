Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that causes the respiratory disease COVID-19, which is
now the third-leading cause of death in the United States. The FDA has recently
approved remdesivir, an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication, to treat COVID-19,
though recent data from the WHO shows little to no benefit with use of this anti-viral
agent. Here we report the discovery of ethacridine, a safe antiseptic use in humans, as a
potent drug for use against SARS-CoV-2 (EC50 ~ 0.08 ùúáM). Ethacridine was identified
via high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library in living cells using a
fluorescent assay. Interestingly, the main mode of action of ethacridine is through
inactivation of viral particles, preventing their binding to the host cells. Indeed,
ethacridine is effective in various cell types, including primary human nasal epithelial
cells. Taken together, these data identify a promising, potent, and new use of the old drug
possessing a distinct mode of action for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
The worldwide outbreak of the respiratory disease COVID-19 is caused by the
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). SARSCoV-2 is an RNA betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. It contains a singlestranded positive-sense RNA genome encapsulated within a membrane envelope 1-4. Its
genomic RNA is approximately 30kb with a 5‚Ä≤-cap structure and 3‚Ä≤-poly-A tail 1. The
genome of SARS-CoV-2 can be split into two main regions that contain as many as 14
open reading frames (ORFs) 5.
The first region, containing the first ORF (ORF1a/b), is about two-thirds of the
length of the genome. After coronavirus attachment and entry into the host cell, the viral
genomic RNA is released intracellularly. The first region of the genomic RNA is used as
a template to directly translate two polyproteins: pp1a and pp1ab. The pp1a polyprotein is
translated from ORF1a. The pp1ab polyprotein comes from a -1 ribosomal frameshift
between ORF1a and ORF1b. The two overlapping polyproteins are processed by a
papain-like protease (PLpro) and a 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro). Both pp1a
and pp1ab are mainly processed by 3CLpro, which is also referred to as the main protease
(Mpro). Mpro digests the polyproteins in at least 11 conserved sites, starting with the
auto-proteolytic cleavage of this viral protease itself from pp1a and pp1ab. The functional
polypeptides, 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1‚Äì16), are released from the polyproteins
after extensive proteolytic processing. Nsp12 (i.e., RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp)), together with other nsps (e.g., nsp7 and nsp8), forms a multi-subunit
replicase/transcriptase complex (RTC) that is associated with the formation of virusinduced double-membrane vesicles 4,6,7. The membrane-bound RTC synthesizes a fulllength negative-strand RNA template that is used to make positive-strand viral genomic
RNA.
The remaining one-third of the genomic RNA is used by the RTC to synthesize
subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) that encode four conserved structural proteins (spike
protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N)),
and several accessory proteins. Eventually, the viral RNA-N complex and S, M, and E
proteins are assembled in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) to form a
mature virion that is then released via budding from the host cell. S protein is exposed on
the surface of the virion and binds the virus receptor ACE2 on the host cell surface.
Therefore, Mpro plays a central and critical role in the lifecycle of the coronavirus and is
an attractive drug target 8-10, which also include other biological steps essential for viral
replication and budding.
To identify drugs that may inhibit the coronavirus, we redesigned the green
fluorescent protein (GFP) into an activity reporter of Mpro, which becomes fluorescent
only upon cleavage by the active Mpro. Using this fluorescent assay, we screened a drug
library in living cells and identified several drugs that inhibit Mpro activity. One highly
effective drug, ethacridine, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 production by inactivating the viral
particles.
RESULTS
Rational design of a fluorogenic Mpro activity reporter FlipGFPMpro

To develop an activity reporter of Mpro with a large dynamic range suitable for highthroughput screening (HTS), we applied the GFP-based protease reporter called FlipGFP
11
, which was designed by flipping one of the 11 beta-strands of a split GFP. Briefly, the
split GFP contains two parts: one part contains beta-strands 10 and 11 (i.e., GFP10 and
11), and the other contains nine other beta-strands and the central alpha helix (i.e., GFP1‚Äì
9). GFP10‚Äì11 contains the highly conserved Glu222 that is essential for catalyzing
chromophore maturation. GFP1-9 contains the three amino acids that form the
chromophore via cyclization, dehydration and oxidation 12. GFP10-11 spontaneously
binds GFP1-9 and catalyzes the chromophore maturation, leading to green fluorescence.
To design an Mpro activity reporter, we ‚Äúflipped‚Äù GFP10-11 using heterodimeric coiled
coils (E5 and K5) so that the flipped GFP10-11 cannot bind GFP1-9 when Mpro is
inactive, and thus, no or little fluorescence is detected (Fig. 1a). We incorporated an
Mpro-specific cleavage sequence AVLQ‚ÜìSGFR (‚Üì denotes the cleavage site) between
GFP11 and K5. In this way, when Mpro cleaves the proteolytic site, GFP11 is flipped
back, allowing GFP10-11 to now bind GFP1-9, resulting in bright fluorescence (Fig. 1a).
We named this reporter FlipGFPMpro. To normalize the fluorescence, we added a red
fluorescent protein mCherry within the construct via a ‚Äúself-cleaving‚Äù 2A peptide13 (Fig.
1c).
To determine if FlipGFPMpro serves to report on Mpro activity of SARS-CoV-2 in
living cells, we expressed the human angiotensin converting enzyme 3 (ACE2), the
SARS-CoV2 receptor, in HEK293-FlipGFPMpro cells. Next, we infected the cells with
SARS-CoV-2, and at 24 hours post-infection, cells were analyzed by
immunofluorescence using antibodies directed against double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
and FlipGFPMpro green fluorescence. The green fluorescence of the sensor, normalized by
the co-expressed mCherry, was 63% greater in the coronavirus-infected cells than in
mock-infected cells (Fig. 1d). Infected cells also showed dsRNA fluorescence compared
to non-infected (mock) cells without dsRNA staining (Fig. 1d). These data demonstrate
that the utility of FlipGFPMpro as a reporter of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro activity in human
cells.
Next, we established a system for screening Mpro inhibitors in living cells by
exogenously expressing Mpro in HEK293. Specifically, wild-type Mpro or an inactive
Mpro mutant (with catalytic cysteine 145 mutated to alanine) were co-expressed in this
cell line. The green fluorescence of FlipGFPMpro was barely detected in the cells
expressing the inactive Mpro/C145A mutant, whereas the red fluorescence of mCherry
was observed (Fig. 1e, upper panels). On the other hand, strong green fluorescence was
detected in the cells expressing Mpro with similar levels of mCherry fluorescence (Fig.
1e, lower panels). The green fluorescence of FlipGFPMpro, normalized to the red
fluorescence of mCherry, revealed an ~60-fold dynamic range between inactive and
active Mpro (Fig. 1f). Furthermore, based on these quantified data, we calculated a Z'factor14

"

which is ~0.8 with Mpro and its inactive mutant as positive (+) and negative (-) controls,
respectively (here ùúé is standard deviation, ùúá is mean). This suggests that the assay is
robust for HTS.
The FlipGFPMpro sensor was not responsive to the TEV protease, and the
FlipGFP-based TEV reporter (FlipGFPTEV) was only activated by TEV but not by Mpro

(Fig. 1f). Thus, FlipGFPMpro specifically detects Mpro activity with a large dynamic
range. Therefore, our data show that we have established a robust HTS system for
screening Mpro inhibitors at a BSL2 level with 60-fold fluorescence change and a robust
z‚Äô-factor. Comparing the normalized FlipGFPMpro fluorescence in the SARS-CoV-2
infected cells (Fig. 1d) with that from the cells expressing Mpro exogenously (Fig. 1e, f)
suggests that the active Mpro concentration in the cytoplasm of the coronavirus-infected
cells is ~100-fold lower than that of the HEK293 cells exogenously expressing Mpro
(under a EF1ùõº promoter).
HTS of drugs that inhibit Mpro activity in living cells
Next, we conducted HTS of ~1600 FDA-approved drugs (20 ùúáM final concentration, Fig.
2a). The reporter construct (FlipGFPMpro and mCherry) was transfected into HEK293
cells, followed by addition and incubation of the drugs. Levels of green fluorescence
normalized to red fluorescence were calculated. A volcano plot revealed ~120 drugs that
showed ‚â• 50% reduction of Mpro activity with a p-value < 0.001 (Fig. 2a). To confirm
this result, we re-screened the identified ~120 drugs under similar conditions (Supporting
Fig. S1). We further assayed those top 15 drugs at a lower concentration (10 ùúáM) and
found that 12 drugs showed ‚â•50% reduction of FlipGFPMpro fluorescence (normalized by
mCherry) at 10 ùúáM concentration (Fig. 2b). We finally calculated an IC50 for each of the
12 drugs. Six drugs were at 2 ‚Äì 6 ùúáM (Fig. 2c), and the rest were above 6 ùúáM
(Supporting Fig. S2).
Antiviral activity of identified drugs
We next investigated antiviral activity of selected drugs in Vero E6 cells. The cell
monolayers were pretreated with the 12 selected drugs for 3 hours, and then infected with
SARS-CoV-2. The cells were further cultivated in the presence of each respective
compound at a concentration of 5 ŒºM. After 16 hours of incubation, the culture media
samples were collected, and the amount of infectious particles were estimated by plaque
assay (Fig. 3a, b & Supporting Fig. S3). Our data revealed that 9 of the 12 drugs showed
significant antiviral activity at 5 ŒºM. Strong inhibition was detected for ethacridine with
5 ‚Äì 6 logs reduction in viral titer, simeprevir ~4-log reduction, ABT-199 ~2-log
reduction, hydroxyprogesterone ~1-log reduction, cinacalcet ~1-log reduction. Two of
the 12 drugs (ivermectin and verteporfin) were cytotoxic at 5‚Äì13 ŒºM in Vero E6 cells
and, thus, were excluded from the further analysis (Supporting Fig. S4). As a comparison,
we tested the antiviral effect of a reported Mpro inhibitor, ebselen, which showed ~2-log
reduction in viral titer. The RdRp inhibitor remdesivir showed ~4-log reduction.
Next, we determined dose-response curves for the top 5 selected drugs. First, our
data revealed that the EC50 of four drugs (simeprevir, cinacalcet, ABT-199 and
hydroxyprogesterone) was 1‚Äì3 ŒºM (Fig. 3c ‚Äì g), within a range similar to their IC50 in
inhibiting Mpro (Fig. 2c). This was consistent with the expectation that SARS-CoV-2
replication is inhibited by restricting Mpro activity. Indeed, as we were finalizing this
study, a preprint report showed that simeprevir inhibits Mpro activity and SARS-CoV-2
15
. By contrast, ethacridine showed outstanding antiviral activity (EC50 ~ 0.08 ŒºM, Fig.
3e), which is 40-fold lower (i.e. stronger) than its Mpro-inhibiting activity (IC50 ~ 3.54
ŒºM, Fig. 2c). These data suggest that the outstanding antiviral activity of ethacridine is
not mainly accounted for by its Mpro-inhibiting activity. Lastly, for comparison, we also

Ethacridine inhibits SARS-CoV-2 by inactivating viral particles
To determine how ethacridine inhibits SARS-CoV-2, we tested infectivity of the virus
particles after ethacridine treatment using plaque assay, and we also measured viral RNA
levels using qRT-PCR. We examined the antiviral effect of ethacridine on different
stages of the viral lifecycle of SARS-CoV-2, including before virus-cell binding, after
cell entry, and after budding. In particular, we pre-incubated SARS-CoV-2 particles with
ethacridine (5 ¬µM) or DMSO for 1 hour. The mixture was then added to Vero E6 cells
for viral adsorption at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) at 0.5. Next, we removed the
solution and added fresh medium containing ethacridine (5 ¬µM) or DMSO. Sixteen hours
later, we collected supernatant and conducted plaque assay with overlaid agar without
ethacridine or DMSO, measured viral titer of the supernatant. We also conducted qRTPCR and measured viral RNA levels in the supernatant and within cells. In this way, we
developed three conditions (Fig. 4a): 1) Control (DMSO + DMSO): the virus and cells
were not exposed to DMSO and not the drug; 2) The virus and cells were exposed to the
drug at all stages, including 1 hour before infection, during replication, and after viral
budding (i.e. Eth. + Eth.); 3) The virus and cells were exposed to the drug only after viral
entry, during replication, and after budding (i.e. DMSO + Eth.). Lastly, we used a fourth
condition (Fig. 4b): we conducted plaque assay right after pre-treatment of SARS-CoV-2
with ethacridine for 1 hr (i.e. Eth. [1 hr]), which determines antiviral activity of the drug
on the viral particles (equivalent to addition of the drug after viral budding).
When ethacridine was present continuous prior to plaque assay (Eth. + Eth.), viral
titers were reduced 3 ‚Äì 4 logs, compared with the control (DMSO + DMSO) (Fig. 4a,
lower left panel). When ethacridine was added to the Vero cells after viral entry (DMSO
+ Eth.), similar level of reduced infectivity (3 ‚Äì 4 logs reduction in viral titer) was
observed (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, when SARS-CoV2 was pre-incubated with ethacridine
for 1 hr (Eth. [1 hr]) and followed by plaque assay without drug, we also observed 3 ‚Äì 4
logs reduction in infectivity (Fig. 4b). This result suggests that the drug directly
inactivates SARS-CoV2 viral particles. Because of similar-level reduction in infectivity
in all of the three conditions, our data strongly suggests that ethacridine inhibits SARSCoV-2 mainly by inactivation of viral particles.
We next examined viral RNA accumulation in infected cells. qRT-PCR
measurement revealed no change of viral RNA (vRNA) levels when the drug was added
after viral binding and cell entry (DMSO + Eth.) in both the supernatant and the cells
(Fig. 4a, lower middle and right panels), compared with the control (DMSO + DMSO).
This indicates that the drug has no effect on vRNA replication. Because plaque assaybased measurement of the same-conditioned sample (DMSO + Eth.) showed 3 ‚Äì 4 logs
reduction in infectivity, our data suggests that ethacridine inhibits SARS-CoV-2 by
inactivating the viral particles without effect on vRNA replication. This is consistent with
the results of plaque assays for the supernatant samples with 3 different conditions that
showed similar level of reduction in infectivity. Here the virions in the supernatant were
exposed to the drug before plaque assay-based measurement of viral titer.
Next, when ethacridine was present continuously (i.e. Eth. + Eth.), 4 ‚Äì 5 fold
reductions were observed in vRNA copies in the supernatant and wthin the cells (Fig. 4a,

middle and right panels). Because plaque assay-based measurement of the same
conditioned sample (Eth. + Eth.) showed 2400-fold reduction in viral titer, the effect of
ethacridine on viral replication (4 ‚Äì 5 fold reduction) is about 500-fold smaller than its
effect on viral infectivity. This further supports the conclusion that ethacridine inhibits
SARS-CoV-2 by inactivating the viral particles. The 4 ‚Äì 5 fold reduction of vRNA copies
is likely due to reduced viral copy numbers that may bind to the cells (see below),
because here the additional step is that the viruses were pre-incubated with the drug.
Thus, our data based on plaque assay and qRT-PCR of different conditioned
samples suggests that ethacridine inhibits SARS-CoV-2 by mainly inactivating viral
particles, including the virus before binding to Vero cells, as well as virions in the
supernatant after budding from host cells, with no or little effect on vRNA replication
(Fig. 4c).
To further investigate the mechanism of ethacridine-based inactivation of the viral
particles, we conducted immunofluorescence staining and imaging to determine whether
the ethacridine-treated SARS-CoV-2 can bind to and enter the cells. We treated SARSCoV-2 with ethacridine (5 ¬µM) or DMSO for 1 hour. Then the virus was added to cells
for adsorption (37¬∞C, 1 hour) at a MOI = 100. Cells were then quickly washed and fixed
with 4% PFA (Fig. 4d). Immunostaining with antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein
(N) of SARS-CoV-2 showed strong anti-N fluorescence on the plasma membrane of the
cells infected with virus+DMSO mixture, but little anti-N fluorescence in cells treated
with virus+ethacridine mixture (Fig. 4e). Immunostaining against the Spike protein (S) of
SARS-CoV-2 also revealed fluorescence signals on control cells, but minimal
fluorescence on cells infected with the virus+ethacridine mixture (Fig. 4f). Quantification
of fluorescence revealed that ethacridine treatment led to a dramatic reduction in
detectable anti-N and anti-S fluorescence (Fig. 4g). These results indicate that
ethacridine-treated SARS-CoV-2 cannot bind cells to initiate infection.
We also tested the dependency of the viral-inactivation effect of ethacridine on
dose, incubation time and incubation temperature with a plaque assay. For the conditions
tested, the viral-inactivation effect showed dose-dependency but was comparable to a 1or 2-hour incubation at room temperature or 37¬∞C (Supporting Fig. S5).
Further validation in human cells
We further evaluated the anti-viral effect of ethacridine in human cells, including a
human lung epithelial A549 cell line stably expressing human ACE2 (A549ACE2) and
human primary nasal epithelial (HNE) cells to ensure that the antiviral effect is not
restricted to the Vero E6 cells. A plaque assay in A549ACE2 cells revealed that
ethacridine-treated virus showed a dramatic decrease in infectivity when applied to
A549ACE2 cells (Supporting Fig. S6), indicating that the the effect of virus inactivation of
ethacridine is not specific to Vero cells. This is consistent with the main mode of action
of ethacridine that it blocks SARS-CoV-2 by inactivating the viral particles and thus its
effect is independent of cell type. To further support this and validate the antiviral effects,
primary HNE cells were infected with ethacridine-treated virus and incubated with the
media containing 5 ŒºM ethacridine for 48 hours (Fig. 5a). The cilia organelles within the
nasal epithelium have been shown to strongly and specifically express the ACE2 receptor
exploited by SARS-CoV-2 16. As a control, we used DMSO solution without ethacridine.
Immunostaining using anti-N and anti-S antibodies in HNE cells showed that, in the

presence of ethacridine, the proportion of infected primary nasal cells was dramatically
decreased (Fig. 5b, c), suggesting that ethacridine protected HNE cells from viral
infection. These data suggest that the antiviral effect of ethacridine is cell-independent,
consistent with the main mode of action of this drug.
DISCUSSION
Several small molecule-based inhibitors have been identified that interfere with major
targets involved in the viral lifecycle of SARS-CoV-2, including the main protease Mpro
and the SARS-CoV-2 replicase RdRp. For example, ùõº-ketoamide inhibitors of Mpro and
the FDA-approved drug ebselen have been reported to inhibit Mpro activity with EC50 at
0.53 and 4.67 ùúáM, respectively 8-10. The replicase RdRp inhibitor, remdesivir, has been
designed and very recently approved by FDA to treat critically-ill COVID-19 patients
6,17
. However, very recent data from WHO showed no or little effect in hospitalized
COVID-19 patients, including metrics of overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and
duration of hospital stay 18. Thus, therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir appears far from
satisfactory, and new therapeutic options are urgently needed.
The current work started through development of a target-specific cell-based
screening assay. We created the Mpro sensor, and our screen of 1622 FDA-approved
drugs led to identification of 9 drugs that inhibit Mpro activity and show anti-SARSCoV-2 activity. We characterized the antiviral property of five drugs further. Four of
them, including simeprevir, ABT-199, hydroxyprogesterone and cinacalcet effectively
inhibited Mpro and blocked SARS-CoV-2. This suggests that these latter four drugs
inhibit SARS-CoV-2 mainly via inhibition of Mpro activity. These drugs have similar or
better EC50 than ebselen, and thus they may be repurposed as potential therapies against
COVID-19. Furthermore, previous computational docking predicted that simeprevir and
venetoclax (ABT-199) bind and inhibit Mpro 19,20. Hydroxyprogesterone inhibits SARSCoV-2, but its mode of action is unclear 21. Our data suggests that hydroxyprogesterone
may block SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting Mpro activity. Utilizing our FlipGFP-based HTS
approach enables screening of Mpro inhibitors in the cellular context, and can be
expanded to visualize activity of key proteases of other viruses at BSL2, and to identify
their inhibitors.
The most potent antiviral drug discovered in the current work, ethacridine,
showed higher antiviral potency than remdesivir and very little cell toxicity (Fig. 3e).
This agent blocks SARS-CoV-2 mainly by inactivating the viral particles. First, unlike
the other identified drugs that show similar range of IC50 in inhibiting Mpro and EC50
against SARS-CoV-2, ethacridine has much higher anti-viral potency (EC50 ~ 0.08 ŒºM)
than its Mpro-inhibiting activity (IC50 ~ 3.5 ùúáM), indicating that the main mode of action
of ethacridine is not via inhibition of Mpro. Second, we provide direct evidence that after
ethacridine treatment, SARS-CoV-2 had markedly reduced infectivity to bind to host
cells. On the other hand, ethacridine does not block viral RNA replication as shown by
the qRT-PCR data. Therefore, our data suggest that ethacridine blocks SARS-CoV-2
mainly by inactivating the viral particles without influencing viral RNA replication. The
precise mechanisms for how ethacridine inactivates the viral particles infection will
require further investigation, such as potential ultrastructural changes of viral particles
and/or binding of ethacridine to viral RNA and/or protein.

Our findings herein reveal a new approach against SARS-CoV-2 through the
inactivation of viral particles, for which the efficacy is expected to be cell typeindependent. Indeed, ethacridine blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cell line
A549ACE2 cells and also in primary HNE cells. Furthermore, ethacridine is non-toxic in
various animal models including rat, mice and rabbits. For example, mice treated with 20
mg/kg ethacridine by i.p. injection showed no toxicity 22. While currently ethacridine is
mainly used as a topical wound disinfectant, it has been applied to patients for treating
puerperal sepsis via intravenous injection 23. Thus, it is plausible to validate its antiviral
effect in animal models and COVID-19 patients. Moreover, because it blocks the
coronavirus by direct inactivation of the viral particles, ethacridine may be used in
combination with other pathway-targeted drugs such as the replicase inhibitor remdesivir
in treating COVID-19 patients for potentially greater clinical efficacy.

Methods
Plasmid construction
Plasmid constructs were created by standard molecular biology techniques and confirmed
by exhaustively sequencing the cloned fragments. To create pcDNA3-Mpro-flipGFPT2A-mCherry, the GFP10-E5-GFP11-Mprosubstrate-K5 fragment was first generated by
PCR with an overlapping primer with coding sequence of the MPro substrate,
AVLQSGFR. This fragment was then digested with NheI and AflII and inserted into the
pcDNA3-TEV-flipGFP-T2A-mCherry 11 .
Characterization of GFP-based Mpro activity sensor FlipGFPMpro
To check the FlipGFPMpro signal in the presence of wildtype or mutant MPro of SARSCoV-2, HEK293T cells were seeded onto eight-well plate and 24 hours later, 40 ng of
pcDNA3-FlipGFPMpro-T2A-mCherry was transfected with 40 ng of pLVX-EF1alphanCoV2019-nsp5-2xStrep-IRES-Puro (expressing wildtype Mpro of SARS-CoV-2) or
pLVX-EF1alpha-nCoV2019-nsp5-C145A-2xStrep-IRES-Puro (expressing C145A MPro
mutant). To check the FlipGFPMpro signal after SARS-CoV-2 infection, HEK293T on 10mm coverglasses were transfected with 200 ng of pcDNA3.1-hACE2 (Addgene,
#145033) 24 hours later. Those 293T cells were further infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an
MOI of 0.5. At 24 hours after infection, 293T cells were fixed and processed for
immunostaining against dsRNA (Scicons, 10010500) and visualized with goat antimouse IgG H&L (Cy5 ¬Æ) (Abcam, ab6563). Images were taken using Nikon Eclipse TiE Spinning Disk under 20X and 60X. The cell pixel intensity in the GFP and mCherry
channels were scored using Analyze Particle function in ImageJ. The ratio of GFP pixel
intensity against mCherry pixel intensity was then compared in cells with wildtype and
mutant MPro or in cells with SARS-CoV-2 or mock infection.
High-throughput screen (HTS) against the FDA-approved library
An FDA-approved drug library (MedChemExpress) containing 1622 compounds was
used for HTS. For initial screening, 293T cells were seeded onto a 96-well plate,
incubated overnight and transfected with 20 ng of pcDNA3-Mpro-flipGFP-T2A-mCherry
and 20ng pLVX-EF1alpha-nCoV2019-nsp5-2xStrep-IRES-Puro encoding MPro using
calcium-phosphate transfection. At 3 hours after transfection, compounds were added to
individual wells at a 100X dilution for a final concentration of 20 ¬µM. Verification of the
120 hits from the initial screening and further IC50 testing of the 12 hits followed a
similar protocol except that a decreasing concentration series was used. Images were
acquired 20 hours after transfection in the GFP and mCherry channels with a Nikon
Eclipse Ti-E Spinning Disk. The cells‚Äô pixel intensity in the GFP and mCherry channels
were scored using Analyze Particle function in imageJ. MPro activity was calculated as
the ratio of the GFP pixel intensity versus the mCherry pixel intensity.
Antiviral assay
The African green monkey kidney Vero E6 cell line was obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, no. 1586) and maintained in Minimum Essential
Medium (MEM; Gibco Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Gibco Invitrogen), 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Gibco Invitrogen), at 37¬∞C in a

humidified 5% CO2 incubator. A clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020, BEI
Cat No: NR-52281) was propagated in Vero E6 cells. Viral titers were quantified with a
plaque assay. All the infections were performed at biosafety level-3 (BSL-3).
To assess the antiviral activity, ~70% confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells
(3√ó105 cells/well in 24-well plates) were pretreated with drugs at different concentration
for 3 hours (pretreatment) and then infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=0.5) at 37¬∫C for 1
hour. The virus solution was removed, cells were further cultured with fresh medium
containing drugs at different concentrations. At 16 hours post-infection, viral titers of the
supernatants were detected with a plaque assay.
Plaque assay
Confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells grown in six-well plates were incubated with the
serial dilutions of virus samples (250 ¬µl/well) at 37¬∫C for 1 hour. Next, the cells were
overlayed with 1% agarose (Invitrogen) prepared with MEM supplemented with 2%
FBS. Three days later, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 2 hours, the overlay
was discarded, and samples were stained with crystal violet dye.
Viral RNA quantification
Viral RNA (vRNA) was extracted from cell pellets or supernatants with Tri-reagent
(Ambion), following the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. The supernatant samples were
pretreated with RNAse A for 2 hours at 37¬∫C to remove non-encapsidated RNA. These
samples were also spiked with equivalent volumes of Drosophila C Virus (DCV) to
enable normalization, based on variation in RNA extractions. RNA from supernatants
was used directly to make cDNA using the iScript RT Supermix (BioRad). For cell
pellets, 1‚Äì2 mg of RNA was treated with DNAse I (NEB), x ¬µL and 2 ¬µL of this reaction
was used to make cDNA. qPCR was done using the Luna Universal qPCR Master Mix
(NEB) and run on a CFX connect qPCR Detection System (BioRad). To determine the
number of vRNA copies per ml, plasmids containing the nucleocapsid gene of SARSCoV-2 (cloned from the USA-WA1/2020 isolate) or the DCV full genome were used as
standards and diluted serially 10-fold to determine target copy numbers. Threshold cycle
(Ct) values were plotted against the number of target-copies, and the resultant standard
curve was used to determine the number of genome equivalents of vRNA in the samples.
For cell pellet samples, the vRNA copy number was normalized to the housekeeping
gene huel, and supernatant samples were normalized to spiked DCV RNA. All samples
were within the range of linearity of a standard curve and primers efficiencies were 100%
+/- 5%. The primers used for SARS-CoV-2 are 5‚Ä≤-TCCTGGTGATTCTTCTTCAGG-3‚Ä≤
and 5‚Ä≤-TCTGAGAGAGGGTCAAGTGC-3‚Ä≤, DCV 5-CAGCAAAGAAACAGCGTGAG3‚Äô and 5‚Ä≤-CACTTGCGCAACAATACGAG-3‚Ä≤, huel 5‚Ä≤TCAGACGACGAAGTCCCCATGAAG-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤TCCTTACGCAATTTTTTCTCTCTGGC-3‚Ä≤
Cytotoxicity assay
Cytotoxicity of the identified drugs on Vero E6 cell was determined with WST-1 cell
proliferation assays (ROCHE, 5015944001). Twenty thousand cells were seeded into a
96-well plate and incubated for 20‚Äì24 h at 37 ¬∞C, and 1 ŒºL of each compound at
decreasing concentrations was added. After 18 hrs incubation at 37 ¬∞C, WST-1 assays

were performed according to manufacturer‚Äôs protocols. All experiments were performed
in triplicate.
Adsorption assay
The virus sample was supplemented with 5 ¬µM ethacridine or with DMSO and incubated
for 1 hour at 37¬∫C. Samples were added to ~70% Vero E6 cells monolayers on coverslips
with an MOI of 100. The cells were immediately placed on ice for 1 hour, and then the
virus suspension was quickly removed, and cells were washed three times with ice-cold
PBS. Cells were immediately fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min at room temperature. PFA
was further washed with PBS and quenched with 1 M glycine in PBS. Immunostaining
was further carried out using an antibody against nucleocapsid (Genetex, SARS-CoV-2
(COVID-19) nucleocapsid antibody, GTX135357) or an antibody against spike (Genetex,
SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) spike antibody [1A9], GTX632604) and visualized with goat
anti-rabbit IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor¬Æ 488) (Abcam, ab150077) or goat anti-mouse IgG
H&L (Alexa Fluor¬Æ 555) (Abcam, ab150114). Images were acquired using Nikon
Eclipse Ti-E Spinning Disk under 60X and processed in ImageJ. Fluorescence signals
were calculated by pixel intensity using Analyze Particle function in Image J.
Statistics
All statistics were performed in GraphPad Prism. IC50 or EC50 of MPro inhibition,
cytotoxicity and antiviral activity was calculated using the non-linear fit function
(Variable slope). Non-paired t-test was used to compare differences between groups. One
way-ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple comparisons test was used to compare differences
among multiple groups.
