in the replication machinery (e.g., the RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase nsp12).[2] Inhibition of Mpro impairs the ability of the
virus to replicate.
Analogous to the 2004 SARS-CoV main protease, the
functional unit of the SARS-CoV-2 MPro is a homodimer (Figure
1).[3] Several encouraging strategies to inhibit MPro have been
explored via its covalent inhibition.[3a, 3b] Non-covalent
modulators, including compounds that disrupt the dimer
interface, have not been investigated to the same extent. Drugs
that bind non-covalently can often be fine-tuned to diffuse
through membranes and bind to target proteins with high
affinity.[4] Moreover, these species lack reactive warheads often
leading to higher chemical stability than their covalent
counterparts and a reduction in undesirable toxic effects due to
irreversible binding to host proteins and nucleic acids. Therefore,
non-covalent compounds serve as a promising means to inhibit
viral proliferation.
Previous studies of the SARS-CoV MPro dimer identified
nano to micromolar dissociation constants.[5] We report the
dissociation constant for SARS-CoV-2 MPro determined using
native mass spectrometry (MS), which can directly identify and
quantify the relative amounts of the oligomeric state of a protein
in solution.[6] To probe the monomer-dimer equilibrium we
recorded native mass spectra over a range of MPro
concentrations from 0.313 to 10.0 µM in an aqueous buffer
containing 200 mM ammonium acetate (pH = 7.4). At a protein
concentration of 5 µM, two well-resolved charge state
distributions are readily identified. The high-abundant signals
centered at the 17+ charge state correspond to a deconvoluted
mass of 67,591 ± 0.5 Da, consistent with the expected sequence
mass of dimeric MPro (67,592 Da). A minor peak series between
m/z ~2750 and 3500 Th, is also observed. These signals,
centered at a 10+ charge state, correspond to a deconvoluted
mass of 33,795 ± 3 Da, in excellent agreement with the mass of
monomeric MPro with wildtype N- and C-termini (33,796 Da). As
the concentration of protein is decreased in a series of stepwise
dilutions from 5.0 µM to 0.625 µM, the signals corresponding to

into two viral polypeptides, the main protease M cleaves at eleven
sites to release non-structural proteins required for viral replication.
MPro is an attractive target for antiviral therapies to combat the
coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19). Here, we have used native
pro
mass spectrometry (MS) to characterize the functional unit of M .
Analysis of the monomer-dimer equilibria reveals a dissociation
constant of Kd = 0.14 ± 0.03 µM, revealing MPro has a strong
preference to dimerize in solution. Developing an MS-based kinetic
assay we then characterized substrate turnover rates by following
temporal changes in the enzyme-substrate complexes, which are
effectively “flash-frozen” as they transition from solution to the gas
phase. We screened small molecules, that bind distant from the
active site, for their ability to modulate activity. These compounds,
including one proposed to disrupt the catalytically active dimer, slow
the rate of substrate processing by ~35%. This information was
readily obtained and, together with analysis of the x-ray crystal
structures of these enzyme-small molecule complexes, provides a
starting point for the development of more potent molecules that
allosterically regulate MPro activity.

The coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is the etiological agent of
the 2020 pandemic that has claimed >550,000 lives and affected
more than 12 million people as of July 2020.[1] Coronaviruses
have long existed in nature and have made zoonotic
transmission to humans. Despite the tragic and widespread
effects of these sudden occurrences, we do not yet have
validated anti-viral treatments targeting coronavirus infections.
SARS-CoV-2 packages a large RNA genome of ~30k bases,
two-thirds of which encodes for two polyproteins (pp1a and
pp1b). These polyproteins are processed into 15 non-structural
proteins (nsps) that are liberated from the long polypeptide
chains by two viral proteases, the papain-like protease (nsp 3)
and the 3C like protease (nsp 5). The latter species, named the
main protease Mpro is a cysteine protease that cleaves the viral
polyproteins at eleven sites to generate twelve non-structural
proteins (nsp4-nsp15). Included in these nsps are those involved

the MPro monomer increase concurrent with a decrease in the
peak intensities assigned to the dimer.
To extract a monomer-dimer equilibrium constant we
performed measurements in triplicate at seven different protein
concentrations (from 0.325 to 10 µM) and plotted the mole
fraction of each species as a function of total protein
concentration (Figure 1). Excellent agreement was found
between the measured values and a monomer-dimer equilibrium
binding model (see Supporting Information) providing high
confidence in the derived dissociation constant, Kd = 0.14 ± 0.03

excess of x1187 the fractional abundance of the monomer
peaks increases further to ~15%.
Inspection of the crystal structure identifies the likely origin
of this destabilization; x1187 rests across the dimer interface,
packing into a hydrophobic pocket partially comprised of key
residues Met6 and Phe8 on the N-finger (Figure 2). The long
axis of x1187 rests along the C-terminal helix of protomer 1 and
is proximal to Ser139 on protomer 2, a critical residue for proper
function and assembly.[7] The position of x1187 is important as it
rests in a pocket crucial to formation of a dimer with a productive
topology,[8] prompting us to consider whether or not this, or the
other small molecules that bind non-covalently, mediate

Following the deposition of high-resolution SARS-CoV-2
MPro structures to the protein databank,[3a, 3b] a fragment screen
was released providing structural insight towards 96 candidates
that bind MPro.[3c] Three of these candidates were identified as
binding to the dimer interface; 23 non-covalent and 48 covalent
hits were found to bind the active site. We focused our study to
those small molecules that bind non-covalently to MPro and
considered their potential to both destabilize the dimer and
modulate substrate cleavage. We identified four candidates –
three that bind to the solvent exposed surface (x0390, x0425,
and x0464) and one that binds within the dimer interface
(x1187). We incubated each species with 5 µM MPro at a ligand
concentration range of 1 to 100 µM (0.125 – 20-fold molar
excess). Following incubation for 30 mins we recorded mass
spectra to investigate their effect on the monomer-dimer
equilibrium. x0390, x0425, and x0464 showed no appreciable
perturbation of the monomer-dimer ratios (see Supporting
Information). However, the effect of x1187 on dimerization was
clearly apparent (Figure 2). In the absence of x1187, under the
solvent conditions used to dissolve the small molecules, the
charge state distribution is centered at 15+ reinforcing the notion
that MPro is predominantly a dimer under a range of solution
conditions. Following the addition of a 10-fold molar excess of
x1187 the peaks assigned to monomers, centered at 10+ charge
state, are observed to increase. After addition of a 20-fold molar

To identify the ability for these molecules to mediate the
proteolytic activity of MPro we first characterized the substrate
turnover in the absence of small molecules using an MS-based
kinetic assay. This assay quantifies the change in observable
enzyme-substrate complexes as a function of time. These

complexes are notoriously difficult to isolate and quantify as they
are turned over rapidly; but as they transition from solution to the
gas phase, they are effectively “flash-frozen”. Quenching the
reaction enables interrogation of these transient species
captured in the MS instrument.[9] A mass spectrum collected 30
s after initiating the cleavage reaction is shown (Figure 3).
Several satellite peaks are observed alongside the main charge
state series, one of which corresponds to the enzyme substrate
complex with a mass of 68,781 ± 2 Da, in agreement with
dimeric MPro bound to a single 11-mer substrate (1192 Da). We
also identified a series of peaks with a deconvoluted mass of
68,188 ± 0.5 Da, consistent with the acyl-enzyme complex that
is formed by reaction of the nucleophilic Cys145 with the scissile
Q-S peptide bond of the substrate to give a covalent TSAVLQenzyme complex of mass 68,192 Da (Figure 3). A summary of
the MPro-substrate complexes we identified are listed in Table 1.

Interestingly, we did not observe any peaks corresponding
to monomeric MPro bound to the 11-mer substrate or acylenzyme complex (see Supporting Information). We considered
several reasons for the absence of signals for substrate-bound
monomers. One possibility is that the monomers have enhanced
activity compared to the dimer. The timescale we measure for
substrate cleavage by the dimer is on the order of minutes.
Thus, if monomers were to bind and process substrates the
monomer activity would need to be enhanced by ~100-fold
(complete turnover by ~6 s), otherwise we would readily capture
monomer-substrate complexes. This is unlikely, as other assays
have indicated that monomeric MPro is inactive.[5c] We surmise
that monomers are not only inactive but also they do not bind
the 11-mer substrate with high affinity.
An expansion of the 15+ charge state at three
representative time points reveals that as time evolves, the
signal for the enzyme-substrate complex at 4586 m/z is depleted
(Figure 3). At our longest timepoint (10 min), the signals for the
enzyme-substrate complex are no longer present in detectable
quantities indicating that by this time the substrate 11-mer has
been proteolyzed and the products released (see Supporting
Information). A plot of the relative abundance of the decay of the
enzyme-substrate complex versus reaction time reveals that the
decay is exponential (Figure 3). The experimental data can be
readily fit to a single-step unimolecular kinetics model, providing
a relatively straightforward means to compare half-life changes
in the presence of inhibitors. A plot comparing the half-lives
obtained by incorporating the 20-fold molar excess of the

dimer equilibrium and measuring efficacy in reducing substrate
turnover rates. These relatively straightforward measurements
delineate the mechanism of action of these allosteric regulators either via disruption of the dimer interface or reversible noncompetitive binding, distal from the active site. Overall, in
addition to highlighting new ways of assaying these small
molecules, the results provide a starting point for lead
optimization chemistry with the ultimate goal of deactivating

that covalently modified Cys145 and found no appreciable
changes in substrate turnover, formation of the enzymesubstrate complex, or acyl-enzyme complex (See Supporting
Information). We also characterized the kinetic behavior of MPro
in the presence of 50-fold molar excess of EDTA. We found no
appreciable change in the depletion of the enzyme-substrate
complex, suggesting that trace amounts of divalent metal
cations, (e.g., Zn2+) when added in isolation, are not modulators
of MPro activity.[10]
All of the small molecule candidates tested inhibit MPro
proteolytic activity and bind to locations distant from the active
site
(Figure 4). Specifically, x1187 binds at the dimer interface
and x0390, x0425, and x0464 bind to solvent-exposed pockets
remote form the active site. While x1187 disrupts the dimer, its
proximity to key residues in the vicinity of the N-finger may also
allow it to intervene with the N-finger in regulating activity[8] and
allows us to conclude that all of these fragments inhibit substrate
cleavage via allosteric regulation.
The absence of monomeric MPro bound to substrate raises
an interesting question – how is pp1a/pp1ab processed upon
viral infection? With a high propensity to dimerize, we speculate
that viral polypeptide processing by MPro is carried out through a
pp1a/pp1ab oligomer rather than MPro monomers. Approximating
the volume of a mammalian cell to be 2.43 × 10-3 nL,[11] our
findings indicate that only ~200,000 molecules of MPro are
required for the enzyme to preferentially form catalytically active
dimers and process viral polypeptides. Moreover, the monomerdimer equilibrium may be influenced by other cellular factors; the
assembly state may shift to favor dimers given that MPro could be
enriched subcellularly through the formation of endosomal
vesicles.[12] This may support the formation of pp1a/pp1ab
dimers that transiently associate, facilitating the release of MPro
from within the viral polypeptides.[5c] Regardless of the
mechanisms behind the initial steps of MPro maturation, our
findings provide evidence that disruption of the catalytically
active dimer with small molecules provides an opportunity to
explore potent antivirals with low risk for toxicity.

The SARS-CoV-2 main protease monomer-dimer equilibrium has been characterized using native mass spectrometry. A
straightforward MS-based kinetic assay that quantifies the changes in the amounts of enzyme-substrate complex with time was used
to capture MPro protease activity. The presence of several small molecules that bind non-covalently to MPro and do not compete for
the active site slow the processing of the substrate, providing a straightforward means for prioritizing and optimizing potential
antivirals.
