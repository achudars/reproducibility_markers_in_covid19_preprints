ABSTRACT

6

10

Host miRNAs are known as important regulators of virus replication and pathogenesis. They

11

can interact with various viruses by several possible mechanisms including direct binding the

12

viral RNA. Identification of human miRNAs involved in coronavirus-host interplay is becoming

13

important due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this work we performed computational

14

prediction of high-confidence direct interactions between miRNAs and seven human coron-

15

avirus RNAs. In order to uncover the entire miRNA-virus interplay we further analyzed lungs

16

miRNome of SARS-CoV infected mice using publicly available miRNA sequencing data. We

17

found that miRNA miR-21-3p has the largest probability of binding the human coronavirus

18

RNAs and being dramatically up-regulated in mouse lungs during infection induced by SARS-

19

CoV. Further bioinformatic analysis of binding sites revealed high conservativity of miR-21-3p

20

binding regions within RNAs of human coronaviruses and their strains.

Keywords: coronavirus, miRNA, miR-21-3p, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

23

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coron-

24

avirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) acquired pandemic status on March 11, 2020 making a dramatic impact

25

on the health of millions of people (Zhou et al., 2020a; Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020). Lung

26

failure induced by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most common cause of

27

death during viral infection (Xu et al., 2020).

28

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (22 nucleotides in average) non-coding RNAs which

29

appear to regulate at least one-third of all human-protein coding genes (Nilsen, 2007). Namely,

30

assembling with a set of proteins miRNA forms an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)

and binds the 3’-UTR of the target mRNA. The latter promotes translation repression or even

32

mRNA degradation (Carthew and Sontheimer, 2009). Multiple works suggest the critical

33

function of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of various human diseases. Thus, alteration of miRNAs

34

expression is observed during different types of cancer (Di Leva et al., 2014; Shkurnikov

35

et al., 2019), cardiovascular (Schulte et al., 2015; Nouraee and Mowla, 2015) and neurological

36

diseases (Leidinger et al., 2013; Christensen and Schratt, 2009). Other studies have suggested

37

that miRNAs can also participate in intercellular communication (Turchinovich et al., 2019;

38

Baranova et al., 2019).

39

There is a large number of reports consistently demonstrating the role of miRNAs in viral

40

infections. One of the research directions is connected with miRNAs which can target viral RNAs.

41

Since RNA of single-stranded RNA virus (ssRNA virus) is not structurally distinguishable from

42

host mRNA there are no barriers for miRNA to bind it. In contrast to conventional binding to the

43

3’-UTR of the target mRNA, host miRNAs often bind to the coding region or to the 5’-UTR of

44

the viral RNA (Bruscella et al., 2017). Besides translational repression such interactions can also

45

enhance viral replication or purposefully alter the amount of free miRNA in a cell (Trobaugh and

46

Klimstra, 2017). For example, miR-122 can bind to the 5’-UTR of the hepatitis C virus (HCV)

47

RNA which increases RNA stability and viral replication since it becomes protected from a host

48

exonuclease activity (Shimakami et al., 2012). Another report contains evidences that miR-17

49

binding sites on the RNA of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) are aimed to decrease level of

50

free miR-17 in the cell therefore mediating expression of miRNA targets (Scheel et al., 2016).

51

Other research groups focused on miRNAs altering their expression in response to the

52

viral infection. Thus, Liu et al. showed that proteins of avian influenza virus H5N1 cause the

53

upregulation of miR-200c-3p in the lungs (Liu et al., 2017). This miRNA targets the 3’-UTR

54

of ACE2 mRNA therefore decreasing its expression. On the other hand, it was shown that

55

the decrease in ACE2 expression is critical in ARDS pathogenesis (Imai et al., 2005). Thus,

56

H5N1 virus promotes miRNA-mediated ACE2 silencing to induce ARDS. Recent reports suggest

57

several other host miRNAs which can potentially regulate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression which

58

can be also important during SARS-CoV-2 infection due to crucial role of these enzymes for

59

virus cell entry (Nersisyan et al., 2020). Another example was highlighted by Choi et al. who

60

studied miRNAs altering their expression during influenza A virus infection (Choi et al., 2014).

Nersisyan et al.

miR-21-3p in coronavirus-host interplay

61

It was shown that several miRNAs which play an important role in cellular processes including

62

immune response and cell death exhibited significant expression differences in infected mice. In

63

the same work authors show that treatment with the respective anti-miRNAs demonstrates an

64

effective therapeutic action.

65

In recent work, Fulzele with co-authors found hundreds of miRNAs which can potentially

66

bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well as the RNA of the highly similar SARS-CoV coronavirus

67

(Fulzele et al., 2020). However, this large miRNA list should be narrowed to find high-confidence

68

interactions which should be further experimentally validated. In this work we hypothesized

69

that there can be miRNA-mediated virus-host interplay mechanisms common for several human

70

coronaviruses. For that we used bioinformatic tools to predict miRNA binding sites within human

71

coronavirus RNAs including ones inducing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2,

72

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) as well as other human coronaviruses causing common cold,

73

namely, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-229E. To find and explore more

74

complex regulatory mechanisms we also analyzed miRNome of mouse lungs during SARS-CoV

75

infection to select miRNAs whose expression was significantly altered upon viral infection.

76

RESULTS

77

Human coronavirus RNAs have a large number of common host miRNA binding

78

sites

79

To identify human miRNAs that may bind to RNAs of human coronaviruses we used two classical

80

miRNA target prediction tools: miRDB and TargetScan. TargetScan results can be ranked with

81

different seed-region binding types while miRDB results can be ranked with so-called “target

82

score” associated with the probability of successful binding. Interestingly, for each of viruses

83

TargetScan predicted 2-3 times higher number of miRNAs, while 80-85% miRNAs predicted by

84

miRDB were predicted by TargetScan too (summary on number of miRNAs predicted for each

85

of viral genomes is presented in Supplementary File 1).

86

We constructed the list of 19 miRNAs potentially targeting multiple viral RNAs by selecting

87

miRNAs with miRDB target scores greater than 75 in all analyzed viruses (Supplementary File 1).

88

For the further analysis we selected only high confidence miRNAs according to miRBase, namely,

89

hsa-miR-21-3p, hsa-miR-195-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-3065-5p, hsa-miR-424-5p and hsa3/15

Nersisyan et al.

miR-21-3p in coronavirus-host interplay

90

miR-421. Target scores of selected miRNAs as well as corresponding hierarchical clustering

91

of viruses are illustrated in Figure 1A. As it can be seen, such clustering grouped together

92

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as well as HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 which can be also

93

observed when clustering is performed based on the viral genomic sequences similarity (Zhou

94

et al., 2020b). In order to assess which of these miRNAs could demonstrate activity in human

95

lungs we analyzed miRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Lung

96

Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-LUAD) project. Two of the enlisted miRNAs demonstrated relatively

97

high expression, see Figure 1B. Specifically, hsa-miR-21-3p and hsa-miR-16-5p corresponded to

98

top-5% of the most highly expressed miRNAs according to their mean expression level taken

99

across all samples.

100

The miR-21 and its target genes exhibit significant expression alteration in mouse

101

lungs during SARS-CoV infection

102

To further explore a potential interplay between host miRNAs and coronaviruses we hypothesized

103

that some of miRNAs predicted to bind viral RNAs can have altered expression during the

104

infection. In order to test this hypothesis we analyzed two publicly available miRNA-seq datasets

105

of mouse lungs during SARS-CoV infection. The first dataset (GSE36971) included data derived

106

from four mouse strains infected by SARS-CoV and four corresponding control mice. The

107

second dataset (GSE90624) comprised three infected and four control mice.

108

Differential expression analysis revealed 19 miRNAs in the first dataset and 21 in the second

109

dataset whose expression change during infection was statistically significant (Supplementary

110

File 1). Six miRNAs were differentially expressed in both datasets, five of them had matched

111

fold change signs, namely, were overexpressed in infected mice, see Figure 2. This was a

112

statistically significant overlap since an estimate of the probability for 19- and 21-element random

113

miRNA sets having five or more common elements was equal to 4.07 × 10−7 (hypergeometric

114

test). Surprisingly, miR-21a-3p which we previously identified as a potential regulator of

115

all analyzed coronavirus genomes with one of the highest scores exhibited 8.3-fold increase

116

(adjusted p = 5.72 × 10−35 ) and 11-fold increase (adjusted p = 5.77 × 10−11 ) during SARS-CoV

117

infection in the first and the second datasets, respectively.

118

Expression of mmu-miR-21a-5p (the opposite “guide” strand of the same hairpin) was also

119

increased in the infected group (2.8- and 3.2-folds, respectively). The latter had a particular

Nersisyan et al.

miR-21-3p in coronavirus-host interplay

120

importance since mmu-miR-21a-5p was very highly expressed in mice during both experiments.

121

Namely, according to its mean expression across all samples it was 4th and 38th out of 2302 in

122

the first and the second datasets, respectively. Thus, significant expression change of this miRNA

123

can dramatically affect expression of its target genes.

124

In order to capture aberrant expression of miRNA target genes during infection we analyzed

125

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of eight SARS-CoV infected mice strains published by the

126

same group of authors as in the first miRNA-seq dataset (GSE52405). Two strategies were

127

utilized to generate a list of miRNA targets. Namely, we used the target prediction tools described

128

in the previous section as well as the literature-curated miRTarBase database.

129

First, we took genes predicted both by miRDB and TargetScan with miRDB target score

130

greater than 75. Additionally, we thresholded this list using top 10% predictions based on

131

TargetScan’s cumulative weighted context++ score. A significant fraction of mmu-miR-21a-5p

132

target genes were down-regulated during the infection. Namely, 6 out of 24 considered genes

133

demonstrated significant decrease in expression (hypergeometric test p = 7.6 × 10−3 ). For four

134

other miRNAs there was no statistical significance on the number of down-regulated target

135

genes. Situation was quite different for interactions enlisted in miRTarBase. Thus, 2 out of

136

2 mmu-miR-21a-3p target genes (Snca and Reck) were down-regulated (hypergeometric test

137

p = 5.7 × 10−3 ) while only 6 out of 37 mmu-miR-21a-5p target genes exhibited expression

138

decrease (hypergeometric test p = 0.057). As in the previous case, no significant number of

139

down-regulated target genes was observed for other miRNAs.

140

Viral binding sites of miR-21-3p are conserved across different coronaviruses

141

and their strains

142

Since miR-21-3p was overexpressed in mouse lung during SARS-CoV infection and was

143

predicted to bind several coronavirus RNAs it is important to analyze the putative binding sites.

144

As summarized in Table 1, all viruses had tens of miR-21-3p binding regions while the peak

145

was observed for HCoV-NL63. To go deeper and analyze mutual arrangement of these sites we

146

performed multiple sequence alignment on seven analyzed genomes and mapped the predicted

147

miR-21-3p binding positions from individual genomes to the obtained alignment. Then, for each

148

binding site mapped to the alignment we calculated the number of viruses sharing that particular

149

miRNA binding site.

Nersisyan et al.

miR-21-3p in coronavirus-host interplay

150

In total, there were 34 positions common for two or more viruses. Interestingly, 31 of them

151

corresponded to nonstructural proteins located in the polyprotein 1ab coding region. Two other

152

positions were located in spike protein, both were shared by HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43.

153

Besides, one position was located in the nucleocapsid protein of HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.

154

One position on the alignment was specific to six out of seven considered coronaviruses, namely,

155

a consensus was obtained for miR-21-3p binding sites on polyprotein 1a of all viruses except

156

MERS-CoV, see Figure 3. One other position corresponded to five viruses (SARS-CoV-2,

157

SARS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63), while two positions were shared by four

158

viruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63) and six positions were shared by

159

three viruses. Full information is listed in Supplementary File 1.

160

To group coronaviruses based on the probability of sharing common binding positions of

161

miR-21-3p we calculated the number of matching positions of binding sites in the multiple

162

alignment for each pair of viruses, see Figure 4A. This data was normalized by 34 (total number

163

of binding positions in the alignment shared by two or more viruses) and used as a distance

164

matrix for hierarchical clustering, see Figure 4B. Interestingly, such clustering fully agreed with

165

the clustering of viruses based on their genomic sequence similarity (Zhou et al., 2020b).

166

Finally, to assess conservativity of miR-21-3p binding regions across viral strains we per-

167

formed multiple sequence alignment of available viral genomes independently for each of human

168

coronaviruses. The results demonstrated high conservativity of these regions: 63% to 86% of

169

binding sites within coronavirus RNAs had not a single mutation (see Table 1) while mean of

170

average mutation rates (i.e. number of mutations normalized by region length and number of

171

strains) across all viruses was equal to 0.5%. Even more interesting results were obtained for the

172

already mentioned binding sites common for several viruses. Namely, for 24 out of 34 regions

173

(71%) there were no mutations in each of viruses, including the one shared by six coronaviruses.

174

For mutated regions average mutation rate was limited by 5%, mean was equal to 0.9%. The

175

exact values of average mutation rates are available in Supplementary File 1.

176

DISCUSSION

177

In this work we found that miRNA miR-21-3p has a potential to bind multiple human coronavirus

178

RNAs. Moreover, aside from virus specific binding sites we identified genomic positions which

179

can serve as conserved miR-21-3p targets for several RNAs. As one can expect, viruses with

Nersisyan et al.

miR-21-3p in coronavirus-host interplay

180

high genomic similarity such as SARS-CoV-2 / SARS-CoV or HCoV-229E / HCoV-NL63 had

181

higher number of shared binding sites.

182

On the other hand, we found that expression of miR-21-3p in lungs exhibits an 8-fold increase

183

upon SARS-CoV infection. Interestingly, miR-21-5p (the “guide” strand of the same pre-miRNA

184

hairpin) demonstrated only 3-folds increase in expression. To explain this phenomena of non-

185

symmetrical expression increase we hypothesize that binding to the viral genome saves star

186

miRNA miR-21-3p from degradation after unsuccessful attempt of AGO2 loading. A similar

187

mechanism was already mentioned in several works. Namely, Janas with co-authors demonstrated

188

that Ago-free miRNAs can escape degradation by forming Ago-free miRNA-mRNA duplex

189

(Janas et al., 2012) thereby confirming previously proposed hypotheses (Song et al., 2003;

190

Chatterjee and Großhans, 2009). A similar concept was named as target RNA directed miRNA

191

degradation (TDMD) which consists of the fact that highly complementary target RNA can

192

trigger miRNA degradation by a mechanism involving nucleotide addition and exonucleolytic

193

degradation (la Mata et al., 2015). This concept was experimentally validated as an example of

194

miR-574-5p and miR-574-3p study in gastric cancer (Zhang et al., 2019). Thus, non-proportional

195

up-regulation of miR-21 arms can be indirect evidence that miR-21-3p directly targets the viral

196

RNA or that the miR-21-5p is being actively degraded during target mRNA binding.

197

Several hypotheses can be put forward to explain biological motivation of such interplay. At

198

first sight, one can think about host miRNA-mediated immune response to the viral infection. For

199

example, translation of human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1) is inhibited by miR-28-3p

200

activity (Bai and Nicot, 2015). However, our results suggest that miR-21-3p binding sites are

201

actually conserved across human coronaviruses. Thus, viruses can purposefully accumulate host

202

miRNA binding sites to slow down their own replication rate in order to evade fast detection

203

and elimination by the immune system. Such behaviour was reported e.g. in the case of eastern

204

equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) (Trobaugh et al., 2014). Authors reported that haematopoietic-

205

cell-specific miRNA miR-142-3p directly binds viral RNA which limits the replication of virus

206

thereby suppressing innate immunity. The latter was shown to be crucial in the virus infection

207

pathogenesis.

208

209

A functional activity of miR-21-3p was already mentioned in the context of viral infections.
Thus, it was shown that miR-21-3p regulates the replication of influenza A virus (IAV) (Xia

Nersisyan et al.

miR-21-3p in coronavirus-host interplay

210

et al., 2018). Namely, hsa-miR-21-3p targeting 3’-UTR of HDAC8 gene was shown to be down-

211

regulated during IAV infection of human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 using both miRNA

212

microarray and quantitative PCR analysis. Consecutive increase in the HDAC8 expression was

213

shown to promote viral replication.

214

Indeed, overexpression of miRNA can lead to down-regulation of its target genes. Multiple

215

reports indicate a role of miR-21-3p in such pathways as cell proliferation, cell cycle phases,

216

and the DNA metabolic process. Gao et al. demonstrated that the miR-21-3p can promote cell

217

proliferation and decrease apoptosis in cancer stem cells (CSCs) by regulating TRAF4, which

218

functions are related to cell proliferation and apoptosis (Gao et al., 2019). In another work Liu

219

et al. demonstrated that the downregulation of miR-21-3p can inhibit the apoptosis caused by

220

lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Liu et al., 2019). The apoptosis inhibition was shown to happen due to

221

the targeting of the 3’-UTR of RGS4 mRNA by miR-21-3p. There are also prognostic signatures

222

based on the level of miR-21-3p expression. Namely, hsa-miR-21-3p together with L1CAM gene

223

form a reliable pair for overall and disease free survival in ovarian, endometrial, breast, renal cell

224

carcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Doberstein et al., 2014). Finally, miR-21-3p

225

was shown to control sepsis-associated cardiac dysfunction by targeting SORBS2 gene (Wang

226

et al., 2016).

227

MATERIALS AND METHODS

miR-21-3p in coronavirus-host interplay

For the analysis of miRNA-mRNA interactions we also used miRTarBase v8 (Huang et al.,

240

2020).

241

RNA sequencing data and differential expression analysis

242

The miRNA-seq data from the TCGA-LUAD project (Collisson et al., 2014) was used to quantify

243

miRNA expression in the human lungs. Specifically, the data was obtained from GDC Data Portal

244

(https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and included miRNA expression table whose columns correspond

245

to 46 normal lung tissues and rows are associated with miRNAs. We used log2 -transformed

246

Reads Per Million mapped reads (RPM) as a miRNA expression unit.

247

Two miRNA-seq datasets, GSE36971 (Peng et al., 2011) and GSE90624 (Morales et al.,

248

2017), were used to analyze miRNome of SARS-CoV infected mouse lungs. Raw fastq files

249

were downloaded from Sequence Read Archive (Leinonen et al., 2011). Adapters were trimmed

250

via Cutadapt 2.10 (Martin, 2011), miRNA expression was quantified by miRDeep2 (Friedländer

251

et al., 2012) using GRCm38.p6 mouse genome (release M25) from GENCODE (Frankish et al.,

252

2019) and miRBase 22.1 (Kozomara et al., 2019). Gene expression profile of SARS-CoV

253

infected mouse lungs was downloaded in form of count matrix from Gene Expression Omnibus

254

(GEO) (Barrett et al., 2013) under GSE52405 accession number (Josset et al., 2014). Differential

255

expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014). The results were filtered

256

using 0.05 threshold on adjusted p-value and 1.5 on fold change (linear scale).

257

Sequence alignment

258

Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of viral genomic sequences was done using Kalign 2.04

259

(Lassmann et al., 2009). Two MSA series were performed. In the first one we aligned seven

260

human coronavirus genomes. In the second one different coronavirus strains were aligned for

261

each of analyzed viruses. All genomes available on the NCBI Virus were used for SARS-CoV,

262

MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-229E (263, 253, 139, 58,

263

39 and 28 genomes, respectively). For SARS-CoV-2 thousand genomes were randomly chosen

264

preserving the percentage of samples from each country. For each virus we established the

265

mapping between alignment and genomic coordinates. With the use of this mapping, miRNA

266

seed region binding positions within viral RNAs were placed on the alignment.

Data and code availability

268

All code was written in Python 3 programming language with extensive use of NumPy (Van Der

269

Walt et al., 2011) and Pandas (McKinney, 2010) modules. Statistical analysis was performed

270

using the SciPy stats (Virtanen et al., 2020), plots were constructed using the Seaborn and Mat-

271

plotlib (Hunter, 2007). MAS was visualized using Unipro UGENE (Okonechnikov et al., 2012).

272

All used data and source codes are available on GitHub (https://github.com/s-a-nersisyan/host-
