Abstract

8

COVID-19 has a potential to cause chaos in Ethiopia due to the country’s already daunting

9

economic and social challenges. Living and working conditions are highly conducive for

10

transmission, as people live in crowded inter-generational households that often lack running

11

water and other basic sanitary facilities. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the

12

knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of Ethiopians toward COVID-19 following the

13

introduction of state of emergency by the Ethiopian government to curb the spread of the

14

disease. A cross-sectional study design was conducted in nine reginal states and two chartered

15

cities. Data for demographic, Knowledge, attitude and practice toward COVID-19 were

16

collected through telephone interview from 1570 participants. Descriptive and bivariate

17

analyses using chi-square test, t-test or analysis of variance were performed as appropriate.

18

Binary and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to measure the relationship between

19

the categorical dependent variables and one or more socio-demographic independent variables

20

with two-tailed at α=0.05 significance level and 95% of confidence interval. The level of good

21

knowledge, favourable attitude and good practice among the respondents were 42%, 53.8%

22

and 24.3% respectively.

23

education, being resident of Amhara and Oromia regions were independent predictors of

24

knowledge level. While being rural resident, married, employed, having at least basic

25

education, being residents of Afar, Amhara, Gambela, Oromia and Somali regions were found

to be the best predictors of the attitude, being rural resident, government employee, having at

27

least basic education, and living outside of the capital were the independent predictors of

28

practice level of the respondents. The finding revealed that Ethiopians have inadequate level

29

of knowledge and are generally have a mixed outlook on overcoming the pandemic with poor

30

adherence to COVID-19 prevention practice. reinforcing preventive measures and intensifying

31

sensitization campaigns to fill the knowledge gap and persuading people to follow the

32

preventive measures set by the government with concurrent evaluation of the impacts of these

33

measures on knowledge and practice is highly recommended to mitigate the disease.

1. Introduction

35

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease caused by a novel human

36

coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) first identified in china in December 2019 (1). The World Health

37

Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic on the 11th of March 2020,

38

after it has spread to 113 countries worldwide (2).

39

According to current evidence, the COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted rapidly between

40

people through respiratory droplets and contact routes (3). Airborne transmission has been

41

suggested by some studies (4, 5). Recent experimental studies have examined the stability of

42

SARS-CoV-2, showing that the virus remains infectious in aerosols for hours (5) and on

43

surfaces up to days (5, 6). The mean incubation period of COVID-19 is about 3–9 days with a

44

range between 0–24 days (3, 7). However, the mean time between successive cases in a chain

45

of transmission is about 3-8 days suggesting that one becomes contagious before symptoms

46

present about 2.5 days earlier from the onset of symptoms (8). Studies estimated that about

47

44% of transmission of COVID-19 occur before the onset of symptoms (9).

48

The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Ethiopia on 13th of March 2020 (10). The state

49

of emergency was declared by the government on 8th of April 2020 to control the pandemic.

50

The state of emergency includes closing schools, banning public gatherings and requiring

51

employees to work from home (10). The introduction of the state of emergency has been

52

welcomed by most citizens and institutions but was not without critiques from some political

53

opposition parties. While the federal and regional governments announced measures such as

54

suspending large gatherings and inter-city public transport, authorities have not introduced a

55

comprehensive lockdown to try to contain the virus due to some real challenges. Firstly, most

56

citizens live day-to-day and they may see a complete lockdown as counterproductive and unfair

57

to those on the bottom rungs of society. Secondly, complete lockdown could worsen the life

58

of the vulnerable segments of society such as street children, internally displaced persons and

59

refugees (11).

60

COVID-19 has the potential to cause chaos in Ethiopia due to the country’s already daunting

61

economic and social challenges. On one hand, the public health risks presented by COVID-19

62

are vast. Living and working conditions are highly conducive for transmission, as people live

63

in crowded inter-generational households that often lack running water and other basic sanitary

64

facilities. Allowing economic activity to continue unchecked could lead to huge infections

65

within months, with serious cases quickly overwhelming the already weak health system (12).

66

Public health intervention measures are rapidly changing around the world to cope up with the

67

rapid transmission of the disease and to minimize the risk for infection and speared of the

68

disease. However, miscommunication regarding the threat of COVID-19 may lead to public

69

confusion and inaction (13). Being older and having underlining health conditions, reduced

70

ability to access and understand health information, inability to make well-informed decisions

71

and failure to take optimal health-promoting are among the greatest risk factors for sever

72

infection and death due to COVID-19 (13, 14). This situation is especially true when the health

73

information itself is not timely, trusted, consistent, or actionable particularly in sub-Saharan

74

African countries where health inequalities are worsened by lack of political commitment and

75

good governance (15). As a result, a wide range of health disparities may exist by age,

76

ethnicity, regions, political affiliations and socio-demographic status (15-17). Therefore,

77

During COVID-19 pandemic when the understanding of critical preventive measures and

78

ever-changing public health messages is most important, many vulnerable populations may be

79

further marginalized by inadequate health communication, posing substantial risks to

80

themselves and their communities.

81

On the other hand, the success of national preventive strategy of a pandemic is largely depends

82

on the adherence of the public to the preventive measures established by the government. The

83

public adherence is likely to be influenced by trust in government (18) and by public

84

knowledge and attitude toward the pandemic (19). By evaluating the public knowledge, attitude

85

and practice about COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible to explore attributes that influence the

86

public in adopting practices and responsive behaviour toward COVID-19 prevention measures.

87

Thus, the aim of study was to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of

88

Ethiopians toward COVID-19 following the introduction of state of emergency by the

89

Ethiopian government to help curb the spread of COVID-19 following 55 cases and 2 fatalities

90

on April 8, 2020 (20). we conducted a time sensitive KAP study in all regional states and

91

chartered cities of Ethiopia from May 20, 2020 to June 20, 2020.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study design and site

94

A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 20 to June 20, 2020 in nine regional states

95

and two charted cities of Ethiopia. The regional statues include Tigray, Afar, Amhara, Oromia,

96

Harari, Somali, Gambela, Benishangul and Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples’

97

Region. (SNNP). The two charted cities are Addis Ababa (Finfinnee) and Dire Dawa.

2.2. Study population
The study population included all peoples living in the nine regional states and two chartered
cities who are 18 years old and above during the study period.
2.3. Study procedure

102

This study was conducted after the government declared a state of emergency in the country to

103

help curb the spread of COVID-19 following 55 cases and 2 fatalities on April 8, 2020. As face

104

to face data collection was impossible, we opted to use telephone interview for enrolling

105

potential participants. We ruled out the online enrolling methods for two reasons: Firstly, only

106

about 17% of the population has access to the internet penetration but more than 45% of the

107

population has access to either mobile network or fixed landline telephones in 2020 (21).

108

Secondly, adult literacy is only 52% and social media penetration in Ethiopia is 5.5% by

109

January 2020 (22). As a result, telephone interview was found to be the best alternative among

110

the existing methods of data collection where face-to-face data collection is not possible.

111

2.4. Study tools

112

We adapted the survey tools from previous KAP studies towards COVID-19 (2, 13, 19). We

113

included four core themes to assess the KAP of Ethiopians toward COVID-19. (i) demographic

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.22.215590; this version posted July 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

114

data collection tools. (ii) knowledge about COVID-19, (iii) attitude toward COVID-19 and (iv)

115

practices appropriate to curb covid-19 infection and transmission.

116

Demographic questions: Each respondent was asked for age, gender, residence, occupation,

117

region, educational and marriage status.

118

COVID-19 Knowledge: Demonstrated knowledge of COVID-19 was assessed through asking

119

the respondents 10 close-ended questions. The questions include the respondents’ knowledge

120

about the cause, transmission route, clinical symptoms, prevention and control measures of

121

COVID-19. Respondents were given three response options: ‘true’, ‘false’ or ‘I do not now’.

122

A correct response was assigned 1 point, while an incorrect or I do not know response to the

123

question was assigned 0 points.

124

Higher score indicates better knowledge of COVID-19 (supplementary (1).

125

Attitude toward COVID-19: To assess the attitude of respondents toward COVID-19, we

126

used 5 questions. Two questions include confidence of the respondent on COVID-19

127

prevention methods and confidence on the government to contain the spreading of coronavirus.

128

They were also asked if they are in favour of the state of emergency introduced to curb the

129

spread of COVID-19, their perception to get infected with coronavirus and if they believe

130

traditional herbs and religious faith can cure COVID-19. For each question a 4-point Likert

131

scale response options (strongly disagree, disagree, agree and straggly agree) were provided

132

(supplementary (1).

133

Practice towards COVID-19 prevention: To investigate how aften respondents’ practice

134

COVID-19 prevention, 5-questions were used. The questions include how often the respondent

135

wash its hand with soap, avoid non-essential travel, keep 2-meter social distancing, avoid social

136

gatherings and avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed (unsensitized) hands. For

Each respondent achieves between 0 and 10 score points.

137

each question a 4-point Likert scale response options (never, sometimes, usually and always)

138

were provided.

139

2.5. Data collection methods

140

Twenty data collectors were recruited and trained online. The data collectors were recruited

141

from each region. All data collectors had previous experience of KAP data collection by phone.

142

In most cases, phone numbers were randomly selected from local phone book. Following the

143

verbal consent, each respondent was assured that the voice is not recorded, and any personal

144

data is not required to participate in the study.

145

2.6. Operational definitions

146

Independent variables: all sociodemographic variables: age, sex, education, marital status,

147

residence, employment and region are considered as independent variables.

148

Dependent Variables: knowledge, attitude and practice toward COVID-19 were considered

149

as dependent variables for all statistical analysis.

150

Good level of knowledge: Respondents who scored above the mean score of the total

151

respondents were considered as having good level of COVID-19 knowledge and those who

152

scored below the mean as having poor level of COVID-19 Knowledge.

153

Favourable attitude:

154

considered as favourable attitude for logistic regression analysis. However, for two questions:

155

“I believe that traditional herbs and faith such as holy water can cure COVID-19; and I do not

156

think I will get sick from COVID-19” a response of strongly disagree or disagree were

157

considered as favourable attitude.

A response of agree or strongly agree to attitude questions were

158

Good practice: a response of “usually” and “always” to each practice question was considered

159

as having good practice towards COVID-19 prevention.

160

2.7. Statistical analysis

161

Descriptive statistics (means with standard deviations and percentage frequencies) were

162

calculated for all survey responses. Associations between socio-demographic characterises and

163

responses to COVID-19 knowledge, attitude and practice were investigated in bivariate

164

analyses using chi-square test, t-test or analysis of variance as appropriate. Binary and multiple

165

logistic regression analyses were used to measure the relationship between the categorical

166

dependent variables (knowledge, attitude and practice) and one or more socio-demographic

167

independent variables. results of logistic regression have been reported as adjusted odds ratio

168

(AOR). Data were analysed using Stata for Windows, version 16 (Stata Corp., College Station,

169

TX, USA with two-tailed at α=0.05 significance level and 95% of confidence interval

3. Result
3.1. Social and demographic characteristics

172

A total of 1570 participants completed the survey questionnaire of which 896 (57.1%) of the

173

respondents were male. A third of the respondents were from rural residents. The age of the

174

respondents ranges from 18 and 73 years with a mean ± standard deviation (SD) of 31.6 year

175

± 12.8. Among the respondents, 660 (42.0%) had college or university education while 260

176

(16.6%) are unable to read and write. Occupation-wise, about a third (34.9%) of them were

177

government employees while a fifth (19.5%) of them were self-employed and one in 6 (15.9%)

178

were farmers (Table 1).

3.2. COVID-19 Knowledge

182

The overall correct response of the respondents to the knowledge questions about the COVID-

183

19 varies from 14.0% to 73.6% (Table 1) with the mean knowledge score of 4.2 (SD=2.809,

184

range 0-10) suggesting an overall of 42% (4.2/10*100) correct rate on COVID-19 knowledge

185

test. Knowledge scores significantly differ across each question. Nearly three-fourth (73.6%)

186

of the respondents have heard about COVID-19 but only 42.4% and 37.8% knew COVID-19

187

transmission and clinical manifestations, respectively. Only 14% of the respondents knew that

188

the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19. While about 63.8% of the respondents had

189

correctly answered COVID-19 prevention methods such as handwashing, social distancing,

190

avoiding crowd gatherings and using face mask. only 18.6% of them knew that people who

191

have COVID-19 symptoms should self-isolate at least for 7 days and their household contacts

192

for 14 days. A third of the respondents consider that only elderly people or people with chronic

193

health conditions develop sever condition if infected with COVID-19. Nearly 80% of the

194

respondents did not know that currently there is no effective drug to cure COVID-19 nor

195

vaccines to prevent the infection (Table 2).

The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, continuous
dry cough and shortness of breath
COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or
discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes
Only elderly people or people with chronic health condition develop
sever condition if infected with COVID-19
Peoples infected with COVID-19 virus but not have any symptoms do
not infect others
Children and young healthy adults do not necessarily take measures
against COVID-19 as they are immune to the disease
Handwashing, social distancing, avoiding crowding and using facemask
can reduce the risk of covid-19 infection
People who have COVID-19 symptoms should self-isolate at least for 7
days and their household contacts for 14 days
Currently there is no effective drug to cure COVID-19 nor vaccines to

The student t-test has shown that the level of COVID-19 knowledge was low among female

199

respondents compared to male respondents (P=0.05). Older respondent (50 years) had low

200

COVID-19 knowledge than the other age group (F=8.38, P <0.0001). Similarly, there was a

201

significant difference in the knowledge score of the respondents among age groups, residence,

202

educational status, marital status and regions of residence (Table 3).

205

After grouping respondents into good (mean score ≥ 4.2) and poor (mean score < 4.2) level of

206

knowledge using a bloom’s cut of points, binary and multivariable logistic regression was

207

performed. Age, occupation, residence and education have been significantly associated with

208

COVID-19 knowledge of the respondents with correct prediction of 72.2% in multivariable

209

regression analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis has shown that respondents of

210

age group 50-59 (AOR= 0.562; (95% CI: 0.4285-0.708) and above 59 years old (AOR=0.387;

211

(95%CI: 0.1924-0.4982) were less knowledgeable about COVID-19 compared to respondents

212

in the age group of 18-29. Similarly, respondents those who had college or university education

213

had more than 14 times higher knowledge (AOR=14.026; (95%CI: 9.56431-21.8764)

214

compared to those who are unable to read and write. Respondents from the two most populous

215

regions, Amhara (AOR=0.497 (95%CI: 0.2990-0.6542) and Oromia (AOR= 0.4512; 95%CI:

216

0.3218-0.8026) regional states had poor level of knowledge compared with respondents from

217

Addis Ababa (Finfinnee), the capital (Table 4).

3.3. Attitude

221

Five questions were used to measure the attitude of the respondents towards COVID-19. More

222

than 50% of the respondents either agree or strongly agree that traditional herbs and religious

223

faith such as holy water can cure COVID-19. Half of the respondents think that it is unlikely

224

to get sick from COVID-19. About 47% of the respondents do not agree with the principles of

225

COVID-19 prevention methods such as hand washing, social distancing, avoiding non-

226

essential travel and self-isolation (if have symptoms) and 57.1% of them disagree with the

227

current introduction of state emergency to curb the spread of COVID-19. Only 40.4% of the

228

respondents are confident that the government can prevent a nationwide outbreak of the disease

229

(Table 5).

230

The association between the socio-demographic variables and COVID-19 attitude was assessed

231

by chi-square test (Table 5). The overall favourable attitude response rate was 43.8%.

232

Respondents in the age group of 40-49 years had more favourable attitude (50.6%) towards

233

COVID-19 prevention methods and principles than the other age groups (χ2=8.6, P ≤ 0.05).

234

Interestingly rural residents had more favourable attitude (59.2%) than the corresponding urban

235

residents (37.1%) (χ2 =65.996, P ≤ 0.001). There was strong association between occupation

236

and attitude towards COVID-19 (χ2 = 335.735, P ≤ 0.0001). While government employees

237

had the highest favourable response (77.8%), self-employed respondents had the least

238

favourable response rate (15.7%). The educational status of the respondents was also found to

239

be strongly associated with the attitude of the respondents towards COVID-19 (χ2=195.914, P

240

≤ 0.001). Respondents from Tigray (65.3%) and Amhara (63.2%) regions had relatively higher

241

favourable attitude while respondents from Gambela (17.6%) and Afar (28.6%) had the lowest

242

favourable attitude (χ2 =89.64, P≤0.001) (Table 6).

248

Multivariable regression analysis has shown that residence, marital status, education,

249

occupation and age are factors that most predict the attitude of the respondents with the correct

250

predication of 73.2%. The odds of favourable attitude for being rural resident is twice as high

251

as being urban resident (AOR=1.909; 95%CI: 1.436-2.538). On the other hand, being married

252

(AOR=0.58; 95%CI: 0.398-0.854) and widow (AOR= 0.17; 95% CI: 0.034-0.854) were less

253

likely to have favourable attitude compared to unmarried (single) respondents. Government

254

employees had the highest odds of favourable attitude (OR=4.8) compared to farmers. As the

255

educational level of the respondents increases, the odds of favourable attitude increase

256

(OR=1.41, 1.68 and 3.01) for primary, secondary and college/university education

257

respectively). While, Odds of favourable attitude for respondents from Amhara region is twice

258

the odds of favourable attitude of respondents from Addis Ababa. The odds of favourable

259

attitude of respondents from Afar, Gambela, Somali and Oromia are significantly low (P≤0.05)

260

(Table 7).

3.4. Practice

264

The practice of the respondents to prevent COVI-19 was assessed by 5 questions. About 43%

265

of the respondents never practice any of the COVID-19 prevention methods and only less than

266

one fifth (19.1%) of the respondents follow COVID-19 prevention measures either usually or

267

always. About a third (31.0%) of respondents never wash their hands with soap and 42.9% of

268

the respondents never avoided touching their eyes, nose, and mouth with their unwashed or

269

unsensitized hand. Four of five respondents (81.4%) do not keep 2-meter social distancing

270

whenever they are out for essential reasons. More than half of the respondents never avoided

271

social gatherings for religious, festivals, or other ceremonies since the introduction of the state

272

of emergency (Table 8).

275

There was no statistically significant difference between gender, and among age and marital

276

status in the implementation of COVID-19 preventive measures at individual level. On the

277

other hand, there is statistically significant difference in practicing COVID-19 preventive

278

measure among residence, education, occupation and region of the respondents (P≤0.001).

279

While 27.6% of urban respondents practice COVID-19 prevention measures, only 16.8% of

280

the corresponding rural residents practice these measures either usually or always. Only a

281

small proportion of respondents practice COVID-19 prevention measures in SNNP, Gambela

282

and Dire Dawa compared to respondents from other regions (Table 9).

4. Discussions

297

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by sever acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-

298

CoV-2) and its being pandemic poses a significant threat to public health (9). Given that the

299

disease is pandemic threat with no vaccine or proven treatment drug, preventive measures are

300

the most essential methods available to reduce the infection rates and control the spread of the

301

disease. This implies that public adherence to preventive and control measures are essential to

302

curb the disease. The extent of public adherence to preventive and control measures is affected

303

by their knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP). Therefore, this study was envisioned to assess

304

the KAP of the Ethiopian population for the control of COVID-19.

305

The finding has shown that the participants level of COVID-19 knowledge is unsatisfactory.

306

Only 42% of the respondents achieved a satisfactory knowledge score and the result is lower

307

than most previous reports from various countries (2, 13, 19, 23-25). Our study has shown that

308

Ethiopians had lower level of COVID-19 knowledge than Chinese (80.5%) ((25), Saudi Arabia

309

(81.6%)(24), Bangladesh (54·87%) (26), Malaysia (80.5%) (23) and Tanzania (84.4%) (27)

310

but similar with a study reported from Cameroon (43,7%) (28).

311

Poor level of knowledge of Ethiopians towards COVID-19 could make the spread of the

312

pandemic worst coupled with the country’s limited capacity of testing, contact tracing and

313

isolation of suspected cases. Until the end of June 2020, Ethiopia has tested only less than

314

300,000 peoples among the 114 million population indicating that Ethiopia is far from

315

achieving the pandemic control.

316

Knowledge scores significantly differ across socio-demographic factors which underlines the

317

need for targeted public awareness campaign. Although most of the respondents (73.6%) have

318

heard about COVID-19, only 42.4% and 37.8% knew COVID-19 transmission and clinical

319

manifestations, respectively. Furthermore, only less than 20% of the respondents knew that

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.22.215590; this version posted July 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint
(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. It is
made available under aCC-BY 4.0 International license.

320

currently there is no effective drug to cure COVID-19 nor vaccines to prevent the infection.

321

This poor level of knowledge towards COVID-19 could be due to limited engagement of

322

Ethiopian institutions, religious sectors, political parties and policy-decision makers to generate

323

contextual knowledge platform to provide an easy and accessible ways of getting credible

324

information. It could be also due to top-down community awareness campaigns, lack of

325

engaging diverse groups by the government, communication overload as large and conflicting

326

information are directed at federal, regional state, and local health bureau from multiple sources

327

which challenges the credibility and acceptability of the information by the general public.

328

However, these proposed scenarios need further investigation.

329

Multivariable logistic regression analysis has shown that respondents from Oromia and

330

Amhara regions are 55% and 50% more likely to be less knowledgeable about COVID-19

331

respectively than other regions. The poor level of COVID-19 knowledge in these two regions

332

could be due to the vastness of these regions to address every corner of the regions adequately

333

using the limited resources and infrastructure the country has. The sporadic protests and

334

instability in these two regions cannot also be ignored affecting the consolidation of the

335

information delivered from the government. This finding is very important since it may

336

indicate that more effort should be exerted to deliver the desired message in these two most

337

populous regions of the country, which account for more than 65% of the population of the

338

country, (29) to control the spread of the disease.

339

Majority of the respondents (59.6%) have no confidence on the government to control the

340

nationwide outbreak of the disease and 57.1% of the respondents disagree with the current

341

introduction of state of emergency to curb the spread of COVID-19 by the government.

342

Unexpectedly, half of the respondents do not agree with the principles of COVID-19

343

prevention methods such as hand washing, social distancing, avoiding non-essential travel and

344

self-isolation symptomatic patients. As a result, only one in five respondents practice COVID-

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.22.215590; this version posted July 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

345

19 prevention measures satisfactorily. It is very difficult to explain why the attitude and practice

346

of the public to fight COVID-19 is low unlike in other countries such as China (25), Egypt (30)

347

, Sudan (31) and Tanzania (27). One reason could be the top-down flow of government

348

procedures to contain the virus may be perceived as authoritarian attempts by government to

349

consolidate control, leading to a loss of faith in the government. This pinpoints that the

350

government need to re-examine the mode of delivery of COVID-19 related messages to the

351

public. Another reason could be related to poverty and food insecurity. The state of emergency

352

weigh most heavily on the poor, who are often part of the informal economy and thus dependent

353

on day-to-day making money to feed themselves and their families. For many of them, a day

354

without work means a day without food. Hence, they may resist to follow government advice.

355

The attitude of the respondents toward COVID-19 significantly varies across some

356

sociodemographic factors. Although rural residents had lower level of COVID-19 knowledge,

357

a significantly higher proportion of (59.2%) them had favourable attitude than urban residents

358

(37.1%) towards COVID-19. Multivariate logistic regression analysis has shown that the odds

359

of favourable attitude of being a rural resident was twice than being an urban resident. This

360

could be due to the fact that rural residents have limited access to various information sources

361

particularly on social media (32). Hence, they largely depend on the information from the local

362

and national governors. Rural residents are also less likely than the urban residents to translate

363

service dissatisfaction into discontent with their government and hence have more trust in

364

government and evaluate information from local and national officials more positively than

365

urban peers (33).

366

Only one in 5 of the respondents adhered to COVID-19 prevention measures either usually or

367

always. While a third of respondents never wash their hands with soap, more than 80% of the

368

respondents had never applied a 2-meter social distancing rule at least once. Ethiopia is among

369

one of the poorest sub-Sharan countries where a significant proportion of the population (70-

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.22.215590; this version posted July 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

370

80%) have no access to adequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene facilities (34) which

371

challenges the handwashing practice to limit the spreading of COVID-19. Maintaining social

372

distance is unattainable practice in Ethiopia since majority of the citizens live in slums. About

373

80% of Addis Ababa, the capital of the country, is considered slum areas, characterized by

374

widespread sanitation challenges where families live in crowded rooms and are exposed to

375

health and safety risks (35).

376

The ability of the government to persuade people to internalize the externality they would

377

impose on the community by not reducing their mobility is one of the most important elements

378

of compliance (36). This is particularly important where the ability to enforce lockdowns on a

379

large scale is unattainable. Evidence from different countries indicates that political beliefs,

380

coupled with differences in media consumption, have important implications for risk

381

perceptions and compliance with social distancing and the Ethiopian government should

382

revisits its COVID-19 prevention strategy (36).

383

Strengthening of government measures, community-based sensitization and health education

384

programs will go a long way to prepare the community to overcome the pandemic. Providing

385

this education to the population will help fill the knowledge gaps reflected and correct the

386

misperception regarding the attitude of the population towards the disease which ultimately

387

improves the practice.

388

5. Conclusions and recommendations

389

In summary, the present study was able to provide a comprehensive investigation of the

390

knowledge, attitude and practice of Ethiopians toward COVID-19. The finding suggest that

391

Ethiopians have inadequate level of knowledge on COVID-19 and are generally have a mixed

392

outlook on overcoming the pandemic. The poor adherence to COVID-19 prevention practice

393

by the public underlines the need for urgent reinforcing preventive measures and intensifying

394

sensitization campaigns to fill the knowledge gap of the population with regards to COVID-19

395

and to persuade people to follow the preventive measures set by the government. At the same

396

time, there is a need to evaluate the impact of these measures on the knowledge and practices

397

of the population with the progression of the pandemic in Ethiopia. Finally, we believe that the

398

study will inspire the healthcare authorities, and media to spread more COVID-19 related

399

accurate knowledge which ultimately results in better preventive practices toward COVID-19.

400

Since no proven medicine or vaccine is developed yet, the best way to curb the spreading of

401

the disease is maximizing knowledge and preventive practices toward COVID-19 at all levels.
