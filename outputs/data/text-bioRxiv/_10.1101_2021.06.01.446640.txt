Abstract

SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing a global pandemic with large variation
in COVID-19 disease spectrum. SARS-CoV-2 infection requires host receptor ACE2
on lung epithelium, but epithelial underpinnings of variation are largely unknown. We
capitalized on comprehensive organoid assays to report remarkable variation in
SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of lung organoids from different subjects. Tropism is
highest for TUBA- and MUC5AC-positive organoid cells, but levels of TUBA-, MUC5A, or ACE2- positive cells do not predict infection rate. We identify surface molecule
Tetraspanin 8 (TSPAN8) as novel mediator of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is not
downregulated by this specific virus. TSPAN8 levels, prior to infection, strongly
correlate with infection rate and TSPAN8-blocking antibodies diminish SARS-CoV-2
infection. We propose TSPAN8 as novel functional biomarker and potential
therapeutic target for COVID-19.

Introduction

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a
global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with over 170M cases worldwide
(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) as of May 2021. Clinically, SARS-CoV-2 can
lead to lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 1. Many SARS-CoV-2
studies have focus on the immune system, currently, we do not understand how the
lung epithelium itself may play a role in variation in disease spectrum of COVID-19.

The lung airway epithelium defends against pollutants, allergens, and pathogens and
is composed of a variety of cell types including basal cells, ciliated cells, mucusproducing goblet cells, secretory cells, and neuroendocrine cells. The distal lung
epithelium also includes alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells, which mediate gas exchange, and
AT2 cells, which secrete surfactant

2 , 3.

In the case of COVID-19, studies thus far

suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infects mostly ciliated cells, goblet cells, AT2 cells but also
basal stem cells

4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

Comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 infection studies focusing on

lung epithelial cell subsets in different individuals have not been reported to date.

Coronavirus (CoV) particles are spherical with three viral proteins anchored in the
envelope: the triple-spanning membrane (M) protein, the envelope (E) protein, and the
spike (S) protein, which form the characteristic trimeric spikes 9, 10, 11. The surface spike
glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme
2) 12. Binding of the S protein to ACE2 mediates membrane fusion and viral entry. The
S protein is cleaved by host cell type II trans-membrane serine proteases resulting in
spike protein activation and viral entry 13, 14, 15, 16. As such, ACE2 and Transmembrane
protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) are critical for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell 17.

Viruses typically co-opt various host proteins to maximize infectious potential

18.

The

wide variation in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and COVID-19 severity suggests that
there must be facilitators other than ACE2 and TMPRSS-2 that have yet to be
discovered. Epithelial organoids have gained traction as a physiological platform for
personal medicine because these organoids retain patient-specific traits19. A handful
of studies have used alveolospheres and organoids to study SARS-CoV-2 epithelial
response

20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25

and tropism

SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large panel of lung organoids has not been reported to
date. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis with the goal of obtaining insights
for different subjects as well as discovery of new molecules that play a role in infection.

Results
A comprehensive lung organoid biobank
We generated organoids from biopsies from healthy donors or adjacent normal tissue
from lung cancer patients undergoing surgery (Table 1). 3D lung organoids from
twenty subjects were expanded through passaging and cryopreserved, generating a
biobank (Figs. 1A and 1B, and Suppl. Fig S1A and S1B).

Spectral flow cytometry analyses with single tube staining of fourteen markers (termed
spectral flow here), including a panel of recently developed airway epithelial markers
31

revealed diversified compositions of cell subsets in fifteen lung organoids. We

identified ciliated like cells (TUBAhigh CD271neg)

32,

goblet like cells (TUBAneg,

MUC5AC+)33 , pre-goblet like cells (TUBAneg , MUC5AC-,TSPAN8+)34, three
populations of cells expressing basal cell markers CD49f+CD271+, CD49fnegCD271+,
CD49f+CD271+,

and

a

population

of

CD49fnegCD271negTUBAnegMUC5ACnegTSPAN8neg cells (Figs.1C and 1D). Lung
organoids derived from different donors displayed distinctive cell type compositions
(Fig. 1E). By contrast, compositions of organoids generated from upper lobe and lower
lobe samples from the same patient were very similar (Suppl. Fig S1B) and analysis
of different passages from distinct organoids demonstrated that our lung organoids
are stable and retain patient-specific composition in passaging (Suppl. Fig S1C).
Spectral Flow Cytometry staining for intra-cellular TMPRSS2 (Fig. 1F) and
extracellular ACE-2 (Fig. 1G) allowed for the assessment of the percent of cells
expressing these proteins that play critical roles in SARS-CoV-2 entry. Pearson
correlations between age and the proportions of goblet like-, ciliated like-, and basalcells in unmanipulated organoids were not significant (Suppl. Fig S1D-S1F). We
selected a panel of twelve lung organoids that captured the variety in cell composition,
age, sex, and ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 expression for further studies.
Viral infections of lung organoids

We utilized H1N1/PR8 influenza virus to optimize viral infection of lung organoids
(Suppl. Fig. S3A-D). Following infection, we assessed cell-composition changes with
spectral flow, adding the cKit marker (Suppl. Fig S2 and S3F), as this receptor has
been suggested to mark lung regeneration upon injury

and tropism of cell types

for H1N1 (Suppl. Fig S3G). Since viral infections trigger epithelial interferon
responses, which help orchestrate immune responses

we also stained for co-

or immune-activating molecules

CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 39, 40. ACE2 has recently been described as an interferonupregulated gene

41.

We observed upregulation of these five cell surface molecules

after H1N1/PR8 infection (Suppl. Fig. S3H).
Having established consistent infection with H1N1/PR8, we switched to SARS-CoV-2
(Fig 2A). Whole mount organoids revealed the presence of double stranded RNA
(dsRNA) and viral nucleocapsid protein (N) in the infected lung organoids, that were
also stained for CD49f and acTUBA (Fig. 2B). Five independent SARS-CoV-2
infections of lung organoid 2522UL demonstrated that our infections were robust and
consistent (Suppl. Fig S4A-D). Spectral flow of dsRNA staining, marking replicating
virus, revealed a remarkable variation in the percentage of (replicating) SARS-CoV-2positive cells in twelve different organoids and 31 SARS-CoV-2 infections with means
ranging from fifteen to zero percent (Figs. 2C and 2D). The percentage of cell death
in the organoids (Suppl. Fig S5A) and infection rates (Fig. 2D) showed different
patterns. We characterized cell compositions (Fig. 2E and Suppl. Fig S5B) and
plotted changes using PCA (principal component analysis) (Suppl. Fig S5C). SARSCoV-2 infection resulted in increased proportions of cells expressing acTUBA (Fig.
2F) and cKit (Fig. 2G), but no alterations in the fraction of basal cells (CD49+ or
CD271+), MUC5AC-positive, or CD49fnegCD271neg cells (Fig. 2H ,Suppl. Fig S5B and
S5D).
In terms of functional markers, CD86-positive cells were increased (Fig. 2I), but
SARS-CoV-2 infection did not cause increases in proportions for CD80-, CEACAM5-,
and CEACAM6- expressing cells (Suppl. Fig S5E), indicating that there was not a
uniform induction of an interferon response program in all cells of infected organoids.
Lungs from COVID-19 patients demonstrate elevated ACE-2 protein expression

We observed significant increases in the proportions of ACE2-positive cells (Fig. 2J)

upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in the 12 lung organoids. The spectral flow allows us to
compare mock-infected to SARS-CoV-2 exposed/infected (dsRNA+), and to SARSCoV-2 exposed/uninfected (dsRNA-). These comparisons revealed that nearly one
hundred per cent of dsRNA-positive, infected cells were ACE2-positive (Fig. 2K).
Similarly, we observed high proportions of cells positive for CD80, CD86, CEACAM5,
and CEACAM6 when analyzing exposed/infected specifically (Suppl. Fig S4E).

Finding the rules of variation in SARS-CoV-2 infection

The lung organoids from subject 2525 express low TMPRSS2 (Fig. 1G), providing an
explanation for the low infection rate in 2525 (Fig. 2D). For the other organoids an
explanation for the variation was lacking. Our panel of twelve organoids and 31 SARSCoV-2 infections allowed us to explore if there are rules that help explain the infection
variation that ranged from thirteen to zero percent on average. We observed a tropism
of SARS-CoV-2 for acTUBA- and MUC5AC- positive cells (Fig. 3A). Depicting PCA of
many factors in a circle of correlation, we established that there are probable
correlations between amount ciliated cells (acTUBA positivity), ACE2 positivity, and
CD86 positivity, determined in non-infected organoids and subsequent infection rate.
There is also a probable correlation between the age of the donor and infection, since
the arrows are of substantial length and point in the same direction (Fig. 3B). However,
statistical analysis of age (Fig. 3C, Pearson 0.45, Pv = 0.14), TUBA-positivity (Fig.
3D, Pearson 0.48, Pv = 0.11), and CD86-, cKit-, or MUC5AC- positivity (Suppl. Fig
S5F) as single factors revealed that none correlate with SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in
organoids.
The percentage of ACE2 positive cells was significantly upregulated upon infection of
lung organoids (Fig. 2J) and nearly all dsRNA-positive cells are also ACE2-positive
(Fig. 2K). However, the proportion of ACE2-positive cells in the organoids prior to
infection, either as mean infection or as single datapoints of all 31 infections, did not
correlate with infection rate (Fig. 3E and 3F). These findings motivated us to search
for novel molecules that show strong correlations with rate of infection and may
function as host proteins co-opted by SARS-CoV-2 in infecting the lung.

Single cell gene expression points to TSPAN8

In search of new mediators of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we infected four organoids with
SARS-CoV-2 and performed single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) of organoids.
Unsupervised clustering analysis based on most variable gene expression across all
cells

43,

regardless of infection status, identified sixteen unique cell subsets

represented in a UMAP plot (Fig. 4A). Based on the top five most differentially
expressed genes by cluster we assigned relative identities to these sixteen
populations (Suppl. Fig S6), though it should be noted that assignment of identity of
single cells of different lung organoids was not our objective here. Furthermore, while
clustering analysis of individual organoids showed significant differences (Suppl. Fig
S7A), read counts were relatively low for organoids L7 and 2524. For this reason, we
treated the four organoids as one collective dataset, while capitalizing on the resolution
of the sc-RNAseq for discovery.

We next focused on cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 transcript to identify specific
transcriptomic signatures in infected cells (Table 2). Metascape pathway analysis

44

confirmed a signature of inflammatory response, in agreement with the identity of
virus-infected epithelial cells (Suppl. Fig S7C). We plotted a cluster of sixty genes that
were differentially expressed in single cells positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral read
compared to false identities (Suppl. Fig. S7B and Table 3A). We mined our dataset
in search of possible novel receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and noted that the surface
molecules TSPAN8, AREG, and CD24 (Suppl. Fig. S7B and Table 3B) were
positively expressed in single cells containing SARS-CoV-2 reads. We were
particularly intrigued by TSPAN8 (Tetraspanin 8), since members of the TSPAN family
are believed to promote cell entry of different viruses

45

, but TSPANs have not been

linked to SARS-CoV-2. Single cell TSPAN8 mRNA reads were present in 64% of cells
with SARS-CoV-2 reads (Suppl. Fig. S7B) andTSPAN8 expression was not limited to
a unique cell subset (Fig. 4B).

TSPAN8 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection and can be inhibited

TSPAN8 mRNA expression had been documented in the supplemental dataset of a
single SARS-CoV-2-infected lung organoid 8, but the role of TSPAN8 in SARS-CoV2 infection has not been investigated. Fortuitously, we had included anti-TSPAN8
antibody in our spectral flow to distinguish goblet like cells from pre-goblet cells
(Suppl. Fig. S2), allowing for surface protein expression to confirm the sc-RNAseq
discovery. The proportion TSPAN8-positive cells in the organoids increased upon
SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 4C), but decreased with H1N1 infections (Fig. 4D). Just
as for ACE2 (Fig 2K), most infected cells (dsRNA positive) expressed TSPAN8 (Fig.
4E), a pattern not observed for H1N1 (Fig. 4F). We further investigated TSPAN8 in
the context of viral infections. Nasal swabs of adult patients with acute respiratory
illness (ARI)

46

due to non-COVID-19, respiratory viral infection revealed

downregulation of TSPAN8 (Fig. 4G). However, such airway brushes from COVID
patients revealed that TSPAN8 expression remained of the same level compared to
comparison to patients with ARI due to non-viral etiology Fig. 4G.

Mining published scRNAseq data of human lungs

3

that predominantly reported on

immune cell composition, we noted that of 61,000 cells sequenced from lung tissue
(as opposed to blood), only 48 cells had expression of both TSPAN8 and ACE2 and
all of these 48 cells were of epithelial origin (Fig. 4H). Furthermore, back-gating on
dsRNA-positive cells and overlaying this onto a ACE2/TSPAN8 contour plot, our
spectral flow revealed that a large proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells
simultaneously expresses both ACE2 and TSPAN8 (Fig. 4J and Suppl. Fig S7F).
Collectively, these data suggest that the two surface proteins may cooperate in SARSCoV-2 infection (Fig. 4I).

Given the TSPAN8 data and the report that TSPAN family member CD9 facilitates
MERS-CoV infection in mice

47,

we considered whether TSPAN8 is a facilitator of

SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 4I). First, we explored TSPAN8 as biomarker. Different
from our studies on ACE2 expression (Figs. 3E and 3F), high percentages of
TSPAN8-positive cells prior to infection did correlate very strongly with subsequent
SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in the 31 infections (Fig. 4K, Suppl. Fig S7G). Lastly, we
explored TSPAN8 as potential therapeutic target. We chose organoid 2450UL that

displays high baseline TSPAN8 expression (Suppl. Fig. S7F), infected with SARSCoV-2, and subjected these to blocking antibody treatment. Addition of a blocking
antibody that binds to one of TSPAN8’s extracellular loops reduced SARS-CoV-2
infection by 60 per cent, roughly in the same range of inhibition of an ACE2-blocking
antibody (Figs. 4L and 4M, Supplemental Fig. S7H and I), which had been reported
previously 14.

Discussion
Here we characterized the composition of 15 lung organoids derived from different
donors. Multi-parameter spectral flow of cell sub-sets shows that the organoids are
stable, but unique from subject to subject, generating a diverse lung organoid biobank.
Subject-specific traits can be investigated, such as the pattern of decreasing amounts
of mucus-producing cells as the age of the donor subject increases (Suppl. Fig S1F).
H1N1/PR8 influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection and spectral flow allowed for
discovery of cell responses. Fifteen antibody spectral flow generates gating strategies
where cell populations are embedded in each other, providing quantitative, linked data
that can be analyzed in many ways. We were intrigued by the increase in cKit-positive
cells after infection, as cKit has been suggested as marker of lung regeneration upon
injury

35, 36.

Possibly infected organoids sense damage and attempt to repair injury.

Spectral flow-assisted gating on SARS-CoV-2-infected cells revealed a clear tropism
for ciliated and MUC5AC-positive cells, but other cell types could also get infected. It
should be noted here that our lung organoids are all embedded in Matrigel as we have
not yet been able to obtain high throughput for organoid with air-liquid interface 48.
Neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients have multiple targets 49, 50, suggesting
that protective immune responses occur that may block interactions of molecules other
than the S protein-ACE2 receptor pair. In our scRNA data RALA and CD24 reads
were present in infected cells. RALA (RAS like Proto-Oncogene A) was identified in
the host-coronavirus protein network

51

and infection levels of a hepatoma cell line is

reduced when deleted by CRISPR17. CD24 is a glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)anchored membrane protein that can repress the host response to DAMPS

52

and

EXO-CD24 exosomes are explored in clinical trials as therapy for COVID19 patients
(Clinical Trial NCT047477574). Studies using cell lines had also implicated additional
mediators of infection, including AXL 53 CD147 54, 55 and neuropilin-1 (NRP1) 56, 57.

We discovered that TSPAN8 strongly correlates with infected cells and infection rate.
Tetraspanin proteins have four transmembrane domains (Fig. 4I) that can form lateral
associations with multiple molecular partners and with each other, organizing the
surface membrane proteins in dynamic microdomains

45.

Tetraspanins promote the

entry of multiple viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), human cytomegalovirus

(HCMV), human papillomavirus, hepatitis C virus, Lujo virus, and several alphaviruses
45.

Depleting the tetraspanin CD9 reduced MERS-CoV lung titers by ∼90% in the

infected mice 47. Our analyses of ACE2 and TSPAN8 protein expression in the context
of SARS-CoV-2 infection of a large panel of lung organoids strongly suggested that
TSPAN8 may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infections. SARS-CoV-2 infection does not
lead to TSPAN8 downregulation, whereas other viral infections do. Bioinformatic

speculates that ACE2

and data from Traveglini et al. 3 showed that epithelial cells

are the only cells in the lung that can express both TSPAN8 and ACE2. Alternatively,
TSPAN8 may cooperate in the lung organoid infections with other mediators, such as
neuropilin-1 (NRP1) described in cell line studies

56, 57

. Future studies are required to

understand the mechanistic details of TSPAN8 and ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2
infection.

Clonal cell lines are powerful discovery tools but lack variations in genetic and
proteomic traits. Lung epithelial organoids are an attractive platform to study
responses to airway infection in the context of diverse cell types 48, but every organoid
from a human subject is distinct. Our study with a comprehensive panel of lung
organoids capitalized on the unique diversity in lung organoids derived from different
subjects to discover TSPAN8 as novel biomarker. Furthermore, blocking TSPAN8
showed a reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral load and TSPAN8 may be a novel potential
therapeutic target in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
