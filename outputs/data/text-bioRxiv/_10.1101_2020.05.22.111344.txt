Abstract.
Despite massive investment in research on reservoirs of emerging pathogens, it remains difficult to
rapidly identify the wildlife origins of novel zoonotic viruses. Viral surveillance is costly but rarely
optimized using model-guided prioritization strategies, and predictions from a single model may be
highly uncertain. Here, we generate an ensemble of eight network- and trait-based statistical models that
predict mammal-virus associations, and we use model predictions to develop a set of priority
recommendations for sampling potential bat reservoirs and intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 and
related betacoronaviruses. We find over 200 bat species globally could be undetected hosts of
betacoronaviruses. Although over a dozen species of Asian horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) are known
to harbor SARS-like coronaviruses, we find at least two thirds of betacoronavirus reservoirs in this bat
genus might still be undetected. Although identification of other probable mammal reservoirs is likely
beyond existing predictive capacity, some of our findings are surprisingly plausible; for example, several
civet and pangolin species were highlighted as high-priority species for viral sampling. Our results should
not be over-interpreted as novel information about the plausibility or likelihood of SARS-CoV-2’s
ultimate origin, but rather these predictions could help guide sampling for novel potentially zoonotic
viruses; immunological research to characterize key receptors (e.g., ACE2) and identify mechanisms of
viral tolerance; and experimental infections to quantify competence of suspected host species.

Introduction
Coronaviruses are a diverse family of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, found widely in
mammals and birds1. They have a broad host range, a high mutation rate, and the largest genomes of any
RNA viruses, but they have also evolved mechanisms for RNA proofreading and repair, which help to
mitigate the deleterious effects of a high recombination rate acting over a large genome2. Consequently,
coronaviruses fit the profile of viruses with high zoonotic potential. There are seven human coronaviruses
(two in the genus Alphacoronavirus and five in Betacoronavirus), of which three are highly pathogenic in
humans: SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV. These three are zoonotic and widely agreed to
have evolutionary origins in bats3–6.
Our collective experience with both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV illustrate the difficulty of tracing
specific animal hosts of emerging coronaviruses. During the 2002–2003 SARS epidemic, SARS-CoV
was traced to the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata)7, but the ultimate origin remained unknown for
several years. Horseshoe bats (family Rhinolophidae: Rhinolophus) were implicated as reservoir hosts in
2005, but their SARS-like viruses were not identical to circulating human strains4. Stronger evidence
from 2017 placed the most likely evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum or
potentially R. sinicus8. Presently, there is even less certainty in the origins of MERS-CoV, although
spillover to humans occurs relatively often through contact with dromedary camels (Camelus
dromedarius). A virus with 100% nucleotide identity in a ~200 base pair region of the polymerase gene
was detected in Taphozous bats (family Emballonuridae) in Saudi Arabia9; however, based on spike gene
similarity, other sources treat HKU4 virus from Tylonycteris bats (family Vespertilionidae) in China as
the closest-related bat virus10,11. Several bat coronaviruses have shown close relation to MERS-CoV, with
a surprisingly broad geographic distribution from Mexico to China12,13,14,15.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus with presumed evolutionary origins in bats. Although the earliest cases
were linked to a wildlife market, contact tracing was limited, and there has been no definitive
identification of the wildlife contact that resulted in spillover nor a true “index case.” Two bat viruses are
closely related to SARS-CoV-2: RaTG13 bat CoV from Rhinolophus affinis (96% identical overall), and
RmYN02 bat CoV from Rhinolophus malayanus (97% identical in one gene but only 61% in the
receptor-binding domain and with less overall similarity)6,16. The divergence time between these bat
viruses and human SARS-CoV-2 has been estimated as 40-50 years17, suggesting that the main host(s)
involved in spillover remain unknown. Evidence of viral recombination in pangolins has been proposed
but is unresolved17. SARS-like betacoronaviruses have been recently isolated from Malayan pangolins
(Manis javanica) traded in wildlife markets18,19, and these viruses have a very high amino acid identity to
SARS-CoV-2, but only show a ~90% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 or Bat-CoV RaTG1320. None
of these host species are universally accepted as the origin of SARS-CoV-2 or a progenitor virus, and a
“better fit” wildlife reservoir could likely still be identified. However, substantial gaps in betacoronavirus
sampling across wildlife limit actionable inference about plausible reservoirs and intermediate hosts for
SARS-CoV-221.
Identifying likely reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens is challenging22. Sampling wildlife for the presence of
active or previous infection (i.e., seropositivity) represents the first stage of a pipeline for proper inference

of host species23, but sampling is often limited in phylogenetic, temporal, and spatial scale by logistical
constraints24. Given such restrictions, modeling efforts can play a critical role in helping to prioritize
pathogen surveillance by narrowing the set of plausible sampling targets25. For example, machine learning
approaches have generated candidate lists of likely, but unsampled, primate reservoirs for Zika virus, bat
reservoirs for filoviruses, and avian reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi26–28. In some contexts, models
may be more useful for identifying which host or pathogen groups are unlikely to have zoonotic
potential29. However, these approaches are generally applied individually to generate predictions.
Implementation of multiple modeling approaches collaboratively and simultaneously could reduce
redundancy and apparent disagreement at the earliest stages of pathogen tracing and help advance
modeling work by addressing inter-model reliability, predictive accuracy, and the broader utility (or
inefficacy) of such models in zoonosis research.
Because SARS-like coronaviruses (subgenus Sarbecovirus) are only characterized from a small number
of bat species in publicly available data, current modeling methods are poorly tailored to exactly infer
their potential reservoir hosts. In this study, we instead conduct two predictive efforts that may help guide
the inevitable search for known and future zoonotic coronaviruses in wildlife: (1) broadly identifying bats
and other mammals that may host any Betacoronavirus and (2) specifically identifying species with a
high viral sharing probability with the two Rhinolophus species carrying the closest known wildlife
relatives of SARS-CoV-2. To do this, we developed a standardized dataset of mammal-virus associations
by integrating a previously published mammal-virus dataset30 with a targeted scrape of all GenBank
accessions for Coronaviridae and their associated hosts. Our final dataset spanned 710 host species and
359 virus genera, including 107 mammal hosts of betacoronaviruses as well as hundreds of other (noncoronavirus) association records. We integrated our host-virus data with a mammal phylogenetic
supertree31 and over 60 ecological traits of bat species27,32,33.
We used these standardized data to generate an ensemble of predictive models. We drew on two popular
approaches to identify candidate reservoirs and intermediate hosts of betacoronaviruses. Network-based
methods estimate a full set of “true” unobserved host-virus interactions based on a recorded network of
associations (here, pairs of host species and associated viral genera). These methods are increasingly
popular as a way to identify latent processes structuring ecological networks34–36, but they are often
confounded by sampling bias and can only make predictions for species within the observed network (i.e.,
those that have available virus data; in-sample prediction). In contrast, trait-based methods use observed
relationships concerning host traits to identify species that fit the morphological, ecological, and/or
phylogenetic profile of known host species of a given pathogen and rank the suitability of unknown hosts
based on these trait profiles28,37. These methods may be more likely to recapitulate patterns in observed
host-pathogen association data (e.g., geographic biases in sampling, phylogenetic similarity in host
morphology), but they more easily correct for sampling bias and can predict host species without known
viral associations (out-of-sample prediction).
In total, we implemented eight different models of host-virus associations, including four network-based
approaches, three trait-based approaches, and one hybrid approach using both network and trait
information. These efforts generated eight ranked lists of suspected bat hosts of betacoronaviruses and
five ranked lists for other mammals. Each ranked list was scaled proportionally and consolidated in an

(Supplemental Figure 1).

Results
Predicted bat hosts of betacoronaviruses
Predictions of bat hosts of betacoronavirus derived from network- and trait-based approaches displayed
strong inter-model agreement within-group, but less with each other (Figure 1A,B). In-sample, we
identified bat species across a range of genera as having the highest predicted probabilities of hosting
betacoronaviruses, distributed in distinct families in both the Old World (e.g., Hipposideridae, several
subfamilies in the Vespertilionidae) and the New World (e.g., Artibeus jamaicensis from the
Phyllostomidae; Figure 1C). Out-of-sample, our multi-model ensemble more conservatively limited
predictions to primarily Old World families such as Rhinolophidae and Pteropodidae (Figure 1D). Of the
1,037 bat hosts not currently known to host betacoronaviruses, our models identified between 1 and 720
potential hosts based on a 10% omission threshold (90% sensitivity). Applying this same threshold to our
ensemble predictions, we identified 239 bat species that are likely undetected hosts of betacoronaviruses.
These include more half of bat species in the genus Rhinolophus not currently known to be
betacoronavirus hosts (35 of 61), compared to 16 known hosts in this genus. Given known roles of
rhinolophids as hosts of SARS-like coronaviruses, our results suggest that SARS-like coronavirus
diversity could be undescribed for around two-thirds of the potential reservoir bat species.
Our multi-model ensemble predicted undiscovered betacoronavirus bat hosts with striking geographic
patterning (Figure 2). In-sample, the top 50 predicted bat hosts were broadly distributed and recapitulated
observed patterns of bat betacoronavirus hosts in Europe, parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast
Asia, although our models also predicted greater-than-expected richness of likely bat reservoirs in the
Neotropics and North America. In contrast, the top out-of-sample predictions clustered in Vietnam,
Myanmar, and southern China.
Because only trait-based models were capable of out-of-sample prediction, the differences in geographic
patterns of our predictions likely reflect distinctions between the network- and trait-based modeling
approaches, which we suggest should be considered qualitatively different lines of evidence. Network
approaches proportionally upweight species with high observed viral diversity, recapitulating sampling
biases largely unrelated to coronaviruses (e.g., frequent screening for rabies lyssaviruses in vampire bats,
which have been sampled in a comparatively limited capacity for coronaviruses14,38–40). Highly ranked
species may also have been previously sampled without evidence of betacoronavirus presence; for
example, Rhinolophus luctus and Macroglossus sobrinus from China and Thailand, respectively, tested
negative for betacoronaviruses, but detection probability was limited by small sample sizes41–43. In
contrast, trait-based approaches are constrained by their reliance on phylogeny and ecological traits, and
the use of geographic covariates made models more likely to recapitulate existing spatial patterns of
betacoronavirus detection (i.e., clustering in southeast Asia). However, their out-of-sample predictions
are, by definition, inclusive of unsampled hosts44, which potentially offer greater return on viral
discovery investment.

Multi-model ensemble predictions also clustered taxonomically along parallel lines. Applying a graph
partitioning algorithm (phylogenetic factorization) to the bat phylogeny45, we found that in-sample
predictions were on average lowest for the Yangochiroptera (Figure 3). This makes intuitive sense,
because this clade does not include the groups known to harbor the majority of betacoronaviruses
detected in bats (e.g., Rhinolophus, Hipposideridae). Out-of-sample predictions were lower in the New
World superfamily Noctilionoidea, the emballonurids, and the Lasiurus genus, whereas the Rhinolophus
genus and the Old World fruit bats (Pteropodidae) both had higher mean probabilities of betacoronavirus
hosting (Supplemental Table 1).
These clade-specific patterns of predicted probabilities across extant bats could be particularly applicable
for guiding future surveillance. On the one hand, betacoronavirus sampling in southeast Asian bat taxa
(especially the genus Rhinolophus) may have a high success of viral detection but may not improve
existing bat sampling gaps46. On the other hand, discovery of novel betacoronaviruses in Neotropical bats
or Old World fruit bats could significantly revise our understanding of the bat-virus association network.
Such discoveries would be particularly important for global health security, given the surprising
identification of a MERS-like virus in Mexican bats14 and the likelihood that post-COVID pandemic
preparedness efforts will focus disproportionately on Asia despite the near-global presence of bat
betacoronaviruses.
Mammal-wide predictions
Although our ensemble model of potential bat betacoronavirus reservoirs generated strong and actionable
predictions, our mammal-wide predictions were largely uninformative. In particular, minimal inter-model
agreement (Supplemental Figure 2) indicated a lack of consistent, biologically meaningful findings.
Major effects of sampling bias were apparent from the top-ranked species, which were primarily domestic
animals or well-studied mesocarnivores (ED Figure 2B). Phylogenetic factorization mostly failed to find
specific patterns in prediction (Supplemental Table 2): in-sample, mean predictions primarily confirmed
betacoronavirus detection in the remaining Laurasiatheria (e.g., ungulates, carnivores, pangolins,
hedgehogs, shrews), although nested clades of marine mammals (i.e., cetaceans) were less likely to harbor
these viruses. Although cetaceans are predicted to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 based on ACE2
similarity with humans47, this result is expected given betacoronavirus epidemiology and their
predominance in terrestrial mammals. Our mammal predictions thus reflect a combination of detection
bias and poor performance of network methods on limited data that likely signals the limits of existing
predictive capacity. Our dataset contained only 30 non-bat betacoronavirus hosts, many of which were
identified during sampling efforts following the first SARS outbreak7. Although the laurasiatherians
include more potential intermediate hosts than other mammals, likely driven by inclusion of bats in this
group, the high species diversity of this clade restricts insights for sampling prioritization, experimental
work, or spillover risk management.
SARS-CoV-2 sampling priorities
Given the unresolved origins of SARS-CoV-2 and significant motivation to identify other SARS-like
coronaviruses and their reservoir hosts for pandemic preparedness21, we further explored our only model
that could generate out-of-sample predictions for all mammals48. This model uses geographic distributions

and phylogenetic relatedness to estimate viral sharing probability. Where one or more (potential) hosts are
known, these sharing patterns can be interpreted to identify probable reservoir hosts48. Because
Rhinolophus affinis and R. malayanus host viruses that are closely related to SARS-CoV-26,16, we used
their predicted sharing patterns to identify possible reservoirs of sarbecoviruses. In doing so, we aimed to
work around a major data limitation: fewer than 20 sarbecovirus hosts were recorded in our dataset, a
sample size that would preclude most modeling approaches.
For both presumed bat host species of sarbecoviruses, the most probable viral sharing hosts were again
within the Laurasiatheria. Although bats—especially rhinolophids—unsurprisingly assumed the top
predictions given phylogenetic affinity with known hosts (Supplemental Table 3, Supplemental Figure 3),
several notable patterns emerged in the rankings of other mammals. Pangolins (Pholidota) were
disproportionately likely to share viruses with R. affinis and R. malayanus (Supplemental Figure 4); the
Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica) and Chinese pangolin (M. pentadactyla) were in the top 20 predictions
for both reservoir species (Supplemental Table 4). This result is promising given the much-discussed
discovery of SARS-like betacoronaviruses in M. javanica18. The Viverridae were also disproportionately
well-represented in the top predictions (Supplemental Figure 5), most notably the masked palm civet
(Paguma larvata), which was identified as an intermediate host of SARS-CoV49,50 (Supplemental Table
4). Our virus sharing model thus captured historic patterns of betacoronavirus spillover and predicted
cross-species transmission from only the phylogeography of east Asian mammals. The opportunity for
inter-species contact depends on both animal behavior and habitat selection, which could be better studied
in natural and anthropogenic habitats for these clades51. However, over evolutionary timescales, our
results suggest recombination and diversification of novel betacoronaviruses should be expected among
such taxa in nature, without necessarily requiring further contact via the wildlife trade. For example,
recent observations in Gabon demonstrate cohabitation between pangolins, bats, and various other
mammals (e.g., rodents) in burrows52.
Moreover, these findings lend credibility to other predictions of SARS-CoV-2 sharing patterns and host
susceptibility. Many of the model’s top predictions were mustelids (i.e., ferrets and weasels), and the most
likely viral sharing partner for both Rhinolophus species was the hog badger (Arctonyx collaris;
Supplemental Table 4). Taken together with reports of SARS-CoV-2 spread in mink farms53, these results
highlight the relatively unexplored potential for mustelids to serve as betacoronavirus hosts and as models
for infectivity studies54. Similarly, identification of several deer and Old World monkey taxa as highprobability hosts in our clade-based analysis (Supplemental Figure 3) meshes with the observation of high
binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptors in cervid deer and primates47. Felids (especially leopards)
also ranked relatively high in our viral sharing predictions (Supplemental Table 4, Supplemental Figure
5), which is of particular interest given reports of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility among cats55. However, we
caution that this model was the only approach in our ensemble that could generate out-of-sample
prediction across mammals, and therefore its predictions lacked confirmation (and filtering of potential
spurious results) by other models that were designed and implemented independently.

Discussion
Several limitations apply to our work, most notably the difficulty of empirically verifying predictions.
Although some virological studies have incidentally tested specific hypotheses (e.g., filovirus models and

bat surveys27,56, henipavirus models and experimental infections23,57), model-based predictions are nearly
never subject to systematic verification or post-hoc efforts to identify and correct spurious results. Greater
dialogue between modelers and empiricists is necessary to systematically confront the growing set of
predicted host-virus associations with experimental validation or field observation.
Already, we have identified roughly a half-dozen new bat reservoirs of betacoronaviruses that our study
correctly predicted. Scotophilus heathii, Hipposideros larvatus, and Pteropus lylei, all highly predicted
bat species in our out-of-sample rankings, have been reported positive for betacoronaviruses in the
literature43,58; however, resulting sequences were not annotated to genus level in GenBank. More recently,
the release of 630 novel bat coronaviruses sequences from China included four additional bat hosts
(Hipposideros pomona, Scotophilus kuhlii, Myotis pequinius, and M. horsfieldii)59. All but M. horsfieldii
were correctly identified by the ensemble, and three models correctly identified all seven verification
hosts (Trait-based 1 and 3 and Network-based 1). These results support the idea that our models identified
relevant targets correctly but also highlight an evident limitation of the workflow. Whereas an automated
approach was the ideal method to systematically compile over 30,000 samples on the timescales
commensurate with ongoing efforts to trace SARS-CoV-2 in wildlife, we suggest this discrepancy
highlights the need for careful virological work downstream at every stage of the modeling process,
including the development of hybrid manual-automated data pipelines.
Additionally, overcoming underlying model biases that are driven by historical sampling regimes will
require coordinated efforts in field study design. Bat sampling for betacoronaviruses has prioritized viral
discovery39,40,60–62, but limitations in the spatial and temporal scale (and replication) of field sampling
have likely created fundamental gaps in our understanding of infection dynamics in bat populations24.
Limited longitudinal sampling of wild bats suggests betacoronavirus detection is sporadic over time and
space58,63, implying strong seasonality in virus shedding pulses64. Carefully tailored spatial and temporal
sampling efforts for priority taxa identified here, within the Rhinolophus genus or other high-prediction
bat clades, will be key to identifying the environmental drivers of betacoronavirus shedding from wild
bats and possible opportunities for contact between bats, intermediate hosts, and humans.
Future field studies will undoubtedly be important to understand viral dynamics in bats but are inherently
costly and labor-intensive. These efforts are particularly challenging during a pandemic, as many
scientific operations have been restricted including field studies of bats in some regions to limit possible
viral spillback from humans. However, various alternative efforts could both advance basic virology and
allow testing model predictions. General open access to viral association records, including GenBank
accessions and the upcoming release of the USAID PREDICT program’s data, could answer open
questions and allow updates to our sampling prioritization (including potentially modeling at subgenus
level, with greater data availability). Appropriately preserved museum specimens and historical
collections, from diverse research programs, also offer key opportunities to retrospectively screen samples
from bats and other mammals for betacoronaviruses and to enhance our understanding of complex hostvirus interactions65. Large-scale research networks, such as GBatNet (Global Union of Bat Diversity
Networks; https://gbatnet.blogspot.com) and its member networks, could provide diverse samples and
ensure proper partnerships and equitable access and benefit sharing of knowledge across countries66,67.
Whole-genome sequencing through initiatives such as the Bat1K Project (https://bat1k.ucd.ie) would
facilitate fundamental and applied insights into the immunological pathways by which bats can harbor

many virulent viruses without displaying disease68,69. Additionally, targeted sequencing efforts could also
identify endogenized viral elements in bat genomes, shedding light on the diversity of bat viruses and the
evolution of bat immune systems70,71.
To expedite such work, we have made our binary predictions of host-virus associations for all eight
models and all 1,000+ bat species publicly available (Supplementary File 1). Such results are provided
both in the spirit of open science and with the hope that future viral detection, isolation, or experimental
studies might confirm some of these predictions or rule out others57. In ongoing collaborative efforts, we
aim to consolidate results from field studies that address these predictions (e.g., serosurveys) and to track
Genbank submissions to expand the known list of betacoronavirus hosts. In several years, we intend to
revisit these predictions as a post-hoc test of model validation, which would represent the first effort to
test the performance of such models and assess their contribution to basic science and to pandemic
preparedness.
It is crucial that our predictions be interpreted as a set of hypotheses about potential host-virus
compatibility rather than strong evidence that a particular mammal species is a true reservoir for
betacoronaviruses. In particular, susceptibility is only one aspect of host competence22,72, which
encompasses the diverse genetic and immunological processes that mediate within-host responses
following exposure73. SARS-CoV-2 in particular may have a broad host range47, given hypothesized
compatibility with the ACE2 receptor in many mammal species, but this only adds to the extreme caution
with which any data should be used to implicate a potential wildlife reservoir of the virus, given that rapid
interpretation of inconclusive molecular evidence has likely already generated spurious reservoir
identifications74,75. Future efforts to isolate live virus from wildlife or to experimentally show viral
replication would more robustly test whether predicted host species actually play a role in betacoronavirus
maintenance in wildlife57.
Without direct lines of virological evidence, we note that our sampling prioritization scheme also does not
implicate any given mammal species in SARS-CoV-2 transmission to humans. Care should be taken to
communicate this, especially given the potential consequences of miscommunication for wildlife
conservation. The bat research community in particular has expressed concern that negative framing of
bats as the source of SARS-CoV-2 will impact public and governmental attitudes toward bat
conservation76. In zoonotic virus research on bats, studies often over-emphasize human disease risks77 and
rarely mention ecosystem services provided by these animals 78. Skewed communication can fuel
negative responses against bats, including indiscriminate culling (i.e., reduction of populations by
selective slaughter)79, which has already occured in response to COVID-19 even outside of Asia (where
spillover occurred)80.
To minimize potential unintended negative impacts for bat conservation, public health and conservation
responses should act in accordance with substantial evidence suggesting that culling has numerous
negative consequences, not only threatening population viability of threatened bat species in shared
roosts81 but also possibly increasing viral transmission within the very species that are targeted82,83.
Instead, bat conservation programs and long-term ecological studies are necessary to help researchers
understand viral ecology and find sustainable solutions for humans to live safely with wildlife. From
another perspective, policy solutions aimed at limiting human-animal contact could potentially prevent

virus establishment in novel species (e.g., as observed in mink farms53), especially in wildlife that may
already face conservation challenges (e.g., North American bats threatened by an emerging disease,
white-nose syndrome79,84). At least two bat species that can be infected by the fungal pathogen (Eptesicus
fuscus and Tadarida brasiliensis) are in our list of the 239 bat species most likely to be betacoronavirus
hosts.
Substantial investments are already being planned to trace the wildlife origins of SARS-CoV-2. However,
the intermediate progenitor virus may never be isolated from samples contemporaneous with spillover,
and it may no longer be circulating in wildlife. MERS-CoV circulates continuously in camels85 and
SARS-CoV persisted in civets long enough to seed secondary outbreaks49,50, but the limited description of
Pangolin-CoV symptoms suggests high mortality, potentially indicating a more transient epizootic such
as Ebola die-offs in red river hogs (Potamochoerus porcus)18. In lieu of concrete data, our study provides
no additional evidence implicating any particular species—or any particular pathway of spillover (e.g.,
wildlife trade, consumption of hunted animals)—as more or less likely. No specific scenario can be
confirmed or rigorously interrogated by ecological models, and we explicitly warn against
misinterpretation or misuse of our findings as evidence for adjacent policy decisions. Although policies
that focus on particular potential reservoir species or target human-wildlife contact could reduce future
spillovers, they will have a negligible bearing on the ongoing pandemic, as SARS-CoV-2 is highly
transmissible within humans (e.g., unlike MERS-CoV or other zoonoses that are sustained in people by
constant reintroduction). SARS-CoV-2 is likely to remain circulating in human populations at least until a
vaccine is developed (if not much longer, given current challenges to vaccine production, allocation,
governance, and uptake), regardless of immediate actions regarding wildlife. COVID-19 response must
be informed by the best consensus evidence available and prioritize solutions that address immediate
reduction of transmission through public health and policy channels. Meanwhile, we hope our proposed
wildlife sampling priorities will help increase the odds of preventing the future emergence of novel
betacoronaviruses.

generally substantial and positive (A,B). Models are arranged in decreasing order of their mean
correlation with other models. In-sample predictions, expressed as host species’ proportional rank (0 is
the most likely host from a given model, 1 is the least likely host), varied significantly due to the
uncertainty of network approaches (C). In contrast, species’ proportional ranks were tightly correlated
across out-of-sample predictive approaches, which relied on species traits (D). Each line represents a
different bat species’ proportional rank across models. The ten species with the highest mean proportional

Methods.
The underlying conceptual aim of this study was to produce and synthesize several different models that
predict and rank candidate reservoir species—each with different methods, assumptions, and framings—
and to rapidly synthesize these into a consensus list. We broadly structured our study around two
modeling targets: (1) produce rankings of likely bat hosts of betacoronaviruses and (2) identify potential
non-bat mammal hosts. We developed a novel dataset that merged existing knowledge about the broader
mammal-virus network with targeted data collection about coronaviruses; implemented eight modeling
methods; synthesized these into an ensemble; and post-hoc identified taxonomic patterns in prediction
using phylogenetic factorization.
Host-Virus Association Data
Entries were downloaded from GenBank on March 27th 2020 using the following search terms:
Coronavirus,
Coronaviridae,
Orthocoronavirinae
Alphacoronavirus,
Betacoronavirus,
Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Data were sorted using a Python script that saved all available
metadata regarding accession number, division, submission date, entry title, organism, genus, genome
length, host classification, country, collection date, PubMed ID, journal containing associated publication,
publication year, genome completeness, and the gene sequenced. The dataset was cleaned to remove
duplicate entries, using GenBank accession number, and entries that did not correspond to viral
sequences, using GenBank division. After cleaning, 31,473 entries remained, of which 25,628 had
metadata regarding host species.
Data from GenBank were merged with the Host-Pathogen Phylogeny Project (HP3) dataset30. The HP3
dataset consists of 2,805 associations between 754 mammal hosts and 586 virus species, compiled from
the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) database, and manually cleaned over a
period of five years. Data collection on HP3 began in 2010 and has been static since 2017, but it still
represents the most complete dataset on the mammal virome published with a high standard of data
documentation. Several recent studies have used the HP3 dataset to produce statistical models of viral
sharing or zoonotic potential29,48,86, making it a comparable reference for a multi-model ensemble study.
Because of naming inconsistencies both within GenBank and between the two datasets (HP3 and
GenBank), we used a two-step pipeline for taxonomic reconciliation. Viral names were matched to the
ICTV 2019 master species list, up to the sub-genus level. Host species names were matched against GBIF
using their species API with an automated Julia script, and processed to a fully cleaned set of names. This
led to an harmonized dataset representing a global list of mammal-virus associations, from which the batcoronavirus data can be extracted for downstream and specific modeling efforts. Because the HP3 dataset
used an older version of the ICTV master list, and because not all host names in the GenBank metadata
could be matched by the GBIF species API (or could be solved unambiguously to the species level), some
host-virus interactions were lost; this reinforces the need to careful data curation of taxonomic metadata if
they are to enable and support predictive pipelines.

Predictor Data
Phylogeny
We used a supertree of extant mammals to unify modeling approaches incorporating host phylogeny31.
Although more recent mammal supertrees exist, we used this particular phylogeny for consistency with
trait datasets and several of the modeling frameworks included in our ensemble. We manually matched
select bat species names between our edge list and this particular phylogeny. This included reverting any
Dermanura to their former Artibeus designation (i.e., D. phaeotis, D. cinerea, D. tolteca)87, switching
Tadarida species to either Mops or Chaerophon species (i.e., Tadarida condylura to Mops condylurus,
Tadarida plicata to Chaerephon plicatus, Tadarida pumila to Chaerephon pumilus)88, and renaming
Myotis pilosus to the more recent Myotis ricketti. Chaerephon pusillus was considered its own species but
is now synonymous with Chaerephon pumilus88. Minor discrepancies between virus data and our
phylogeny were also corrected (Hipposideros commersonii to Hipposideros commersoni [although more
recently changed to Macronycteris commersoni], Rhinolophus hildebrandti to Rhinolophus hildebrandtii,
Neoromicia nana to Neoromicia nanus). In other cases, some recently revised genera in our edge list were
modified to match former genera in the mammal supertree: Parastrellus hesperus to Pipistrellus
hesperus, and Perimyotis subflavus to Pipistrellus subflavus89. Lastly, some names in our edge list
missing from the mammal supertree represent former subspecies being raised to full species rank, and
names were reverted accordingly: Artibeus planirostris to Artibeus jamaicensis, Miniopterus fuliginosus
to Miniopterus schreibersii, Triaenops afer to Triaenops persicus, and Carollia sowelli to Carollia
brevicauda. Although we recognize that these are each now recognized as distinct species, in all cases our
synonymized names are thought to be either sister taxa or very closely related.
Ecological traits
We used a previously published dataset of 63 ecological traits describing the morphology, life history,
biogeography, and diet of 1,116 bat species. These data are drawn from a combination of PanTHERIA32,
EltonTraits33, and the IUCN Red List range maps, and were previously cleaned in a study producing
predictions of bat reservoirs of filoviruses27. Four redundant variables (two for human population density,
mean potential evapotranspiration in range, and body mass) were eliminated prior to analyses, favoring
variables with higher completeness.
Correction for sampling bias
To correct for sampling bias, in the style of several previous studies30,86, we used the number of peerreviewed citations available on a given host as a measure of scientific sampling effort. We used the R
package easyPubMed to scrape the number of citations in PubMed returned when searching each of the
1,116 bat names in the trait data on April 10, 2020.
Modeling Approaches
Our team produced an ensemble of eight statistical models (Supplemental Tables 5 and 6), and applied
them to generate a predictive set of eight models for bats and five for other mammals. Four use a

network-theoretic component (k-nearest neighbors, linear filtering, trait-free plug-and-play, and scaled
phylogeny), while three primarily used ecological traits as predictors (boosted regression trees, Bayesian
additive regression trees, and neutral phylogeographic). A final hybrid model used a combination
approach with a network backbone but incorporating the phylogeny and bat trait data.
All eight approaches were used to generate predictions about potential bat hosts of betacoronaviruses. A
subset of five were used to recommend potential non-bat mammal hosts of betacoronaviruses (k-nearest
neighbor, linear filtering, scaled phylogeny, trait-free plug-and-play, and neutral phylogeographic). We
did not use trait-based models to predict non-bat hosts, because assigning pseudoabsences to the vast
majority (~3500 or more) of mammal species would likely lead to largely uninformative predictions,
weighed against the 109 known betacoronavirus hosts (79 bats and 30 other mammals).
Network model 1: k-nearest neighbors recommender
We follow the methodology previously developed for the recommendation of species feeding
interactions90. This method builds a recommender system internally based on the k-nearest neighbor
(kNN) algorithm, under which candidate hosts are recommended for a virus from a pool constituted by
the hosts of the k viruses with which it has the greatest overlap. Overlap (host sharing) is measured using
Tanimoto similarity, which is the cardinality of the intersection of two sets divided by the cardinality of
their union. To obtain the pairwise similarity between two viruses, this divides the number of shared hosts
by the cumulative number of hosts. The kNN of a virus are the k other viruses with which it has the
highest Tanimoto similarity.
Hosts are then recommended by counting how many times they appear in these k neighbors, a quantity
that ranges from 1 to k. We can impose arbitrary cutoffs by limiting the recommendations to the hosts that
occur in at least k, k-1, etc, viruses. Previous leave-one-out validation of this model revealed that it is
particularly effective for viruses with a reduced number of hosts, which is likely to be the case for
emerging viruses. Furthermore, the performance of this model was not significantly improved by the
addition of functional traits, making it acceptable to run on the association data only.
This model was run two times: first, by measuring the similarity of viruses, and recommending hosts;
second, by measuring the similarity of hosts, and recommending viruses. In all cases, only results for
betacoronaviruses are reported.
The outcome of this model should be subject to caution, as leave-one-out validation revealed that the
success rate (i.e., ability to recover one interaction that has been removed) remained lower than 50% even
when using k=8, and dropped as low as 5% when using k=1 (the nearest-neighbor algorithm). This
strongly suggests that the dataset of reported host-virus associations is extremely incomplete; therefore,
the identification of the nearest neighbors can be biased by under-reported interactions, and this can result
in noise in the prediction. This noise can be particularly important when the kNN technique operates on
viruses, of which the bat dataset has only 15.
Network-based model 2: Linear filter recommender

Following Stock et al.91, we used a previously developed linear filter to infer potential missing
interactions. This recommender system assumes that networks tend to be self-similar, and use this
information to generate a score for an un-observed interaction that is a linear combination of the status of
the interaction (relative weight of 1/4), relative degree of host and virus, and of the observed connectance
of the network (all with relative weights of 1); as we are concerned with ranking interactions as opposed
to examining the absolute value of the score, the penalization coefficient associated to the interaction
being presumed absent could be omitted with no change in the ranking, but has been set to a low value
instead. The scores returned by the linear filter are not directly related to the probability of the interaction
existing in this context, but higher scores still indicate interactions that are more likely to exist. Indeed,
known hosts of betacoronavirus typically scored higher.
We used the zero-one-out approach to assess the performance of this model on the entire datasets. In all
cases, non-interactions ranked lower than positive interactions even when entirely removing the
penalization coefficient from the linear filter parameters, which suggests that the network structure
(degree and connectance) is capturing a lot of information as to which species can interact.
Network-based model 3: Plug and play
For network problems, the “plug and play” model is a statistical approach that formulates Bayes’ theorem
for link prediction around the conditional density of traits of known associations compared to traits of
every possible association in a network. The conditional density function is measured by using nonparametric kernel density estimators (implemented with the R package np), and the conditional ratio
between them is used to estimate link “suitability”, a scale-free ratio. Compared to other machine learning
methods that fit training data iteratively, plug and play is comparatively simple, and directly infers the
most likely extensions of observed patterns in data. The plug and play was originally developed to
forecast missing links in host-parasite networks36, but has since been used to model species distributions92
and predict the global spread of human infectious diseases93. We used this model here to estimate
suitability of host-virus interactions by first modeling the entire estimated network of host-virus
interaction suitability, and ranking hosts that are not infected by betacoronaviruses by their estimated
suitability for betacoronaviruses.
The “plug and play” model is trained using either matched pairs of host and pathogen ecological,
morphological, or phylogenetic traits36, or by using a latent approach93 which considers the mean
similarity of pathogens in their host ranges and the mean similarity of hosts in their pathogen
communities as ‘traits’. We decided to use the latent approach, as host trait data was far more available
than viral trait data. Further, the taxonomic scale considered for host (species) and virus (genus) differed,
making the resolution of potential trait data different enough to potentially confound trait-based
approaches in this modeling framework.
Relative suitability of a host-virus association, as estimated by the “plug and play” model, is formulated
as a density ratio estimation problem. The suitability of a host-virus association is quantified as the
quotient of the distribution of latent trait values when an association was recorded over the distribution of
all the latent trait values. As an attempt to control for sampling effort of mammal and bat host species, we
included PubMed citation counts for host species (as described above) in the estimation of host-virus

suitability. We explored host-pathogen suitability using the entire mammal-virus associations dataset, to
maximize the available information on the network’s structure, and ranked host-pathogen pairs by their
relative suitability value. From the final predictions, we subset out bat-specific predictions. When
predicting, we set citation counts to the mean of training data, as a sampling bias correction.
Network-based model 4: Scaled-phylogeny
We apply the network-based conditional model of Elmasri et al.94 for predicting missing links in bipartite
ecological networks. The full model combines a hierarchical Bayesian latent score framework which
accounts for the number of interactions per taxon, and a dependency among hosts based on evolutionary
distances. To predict links based on evolutionary distance, the probability of a host-parasite interaction is
taken as the sum of evolutionary distances to the documented hosts of that parasite. This allocates higher
probabilities when a few closely related hosts, or many distantly related hosts interact with a parasite. In
this way phylogenetic distances are combined with individual affinity parameters per taxa to model the
conditional probability of an interaction.
In ecological studies, it is common to use time-scaled phylogenies to quantify evolutionary distance
among species95. We may use these fixed evolutionary distances for link prediction, but parasite taxa are
known to be more or less constrained by phylogenetic distances among hosts96. Further, phylogenies are
hypotheses about evolutionary relationships and have uncertainties in the topology and relative distances
among species97. Rather than treating phylogenetic distances as fixed, Elmasri et al.94 re-scale the
phylogeny by applying a macroevolutionary model of trait evolution. While any evolutionary model that
re-scales the covariance matrix may be used, we use the early-burst model, which allows evolutionary
change to accelerate or decelerate through time98. This different emphasis to be placed on deep versus
recent host divergences when predicting links.
We apply the model to a network of associations among host species and viral genera, and the mammal
supertree, which allows us to leverage information from across the network to predict undocumented batbetacoronavirus associations. We fit sets of models, applying both the full model, and the phylogeny-only
model to both the bat-viral genera associations, and the mammal-viral genera associations. For each datamodel combination we fit the model using ten-fold cross-validation holding out links for which there is a
minimum of two observed interactions. The posterior interaction matrices resulting from each of the ten
models are then averaged to generate predictions for all links in the network, with betacoronaviruses
subset to generate the ensemble predictions.
To assess predictive performance, we attempted to predict the held out interactions, and calculated AUC
scores by thresholding predicted probabilities per fold, and taking an average across the 10 folds. In
addition to AUC, we also assessed the model based on the percent of documented interactions accurately
recovered. For the bat-viral genera data the full model resulted in an average AUC of 0.82 and recovered
an average of 90.1% of held out interactions, while the phylogeny-only model showed increased AUC
(0.86), but a decreased proportion of held-out interactions recovered (84.5%). Interestingly, the models
for bat-virus genera associations had marginally worse predictive performance compared to the same
models run on the larger network of mammal-virus associations (full model: AUC 0.88, 84.4% positive
interactions recovered; phylogeny-only model:AUC: 0.88, 88.8% positive interactions recovered),

indicating that predicting bat-betacoronavirus associations may benefit from including data on non-bat
hosts. The models also estimated the scaling parameter (eta) of the early-burst model to be positive
(average eta=7.92 for the full model run on the bat subset), indicating accelerating evolution compared to
the input tree (Supplemental Figure 6). This means that recent divergences are given more weight than
deeper ones for determining bat-viral genera associations, which is consistent with recent work on viral
sharing48,99.
Trait-based model 1: Boosted regression trees
Previous work has been highly successful in predicting zoonotic reservoirs using a combination of
taxonomic, ecological, and geographic traits as predictors. This approach has been previously used to
identify wildlife hosts of filoviruses27,100, flaviviruses28,101, henipaviruses23, Borrelia burgdorferi26, to
predict mosquito vectors of flaviviruses102, and to predict rodent reservoirs and tick vectors of zoonotic
viruses37,103. These approaches treat the presence of a specific virus (or genus of viruses) or a zoonotic
pathogen as an outcome variable, with negative values given for species not known to be hosts
(pseudoabsences), and use machine learning to identify the characteristics that predispose animals to
hosting pathogens of concern. By predicting the probability that a given pseudoabsence is a false
negative, the method can infer potential undetected or undiscovered host species.
This approach has almost exclusively been implemented using boosted regression trees (BRT), a
classification and regression tree (CART) machine learning method that became popular a decade ago for
species distribution modeling.104 Boosted regression trees develop an ensemble of classification trees
which iteratively explain the residuals of previous trees, up to a fixed tree depth (usually between 3 and 5
splits). The incorporation of boosting allows the model, as it is fit, to progressively better explain poorlyfit cases within training data.
We used boosted regression trees to identify trait profiles that predict bat hosts of betacoronaviruses,
including all trait predictors from the trait database that met baseline coverage (< 50% missing values)
and variation (< 97% homogenous) thresholds. For all model fitting, we specified a Bernoulli error
distribution for our binary response variable and applied 10-fold cross validation to prevent overfitting (R
package gbm). We started by fitting a global model to our full dataset, first specifying learning rate = 0.01
(shrinks the contribution of each tree to the model) and tree complexity = 4 (controls tree depth) as per
default values and subsequently tuning to minimize cross-validation error.
We reduced the variable set by calling the gbm.simp() function, which computes and compares the mean
change in cross-validation error (deviance) produced by dropping different sets of least-contributing
predictors. The final simplified model included 23 variables, plus citation counts, which we added to
correct for sampling bias.
We applied bootstrapping resampling methods to estimate uncertainty, using our tuned model to fit 1000
replicate models. For each model, training sets were assembled by randomly selecting with replacement
79 bat-coronavirus associations from the set of reported bat hosts and 79 pseudoabsences. Trained models
were used to generate relative influence coefficients for trait predictors and coronavirus host probabilities
across all bat species. Partial dependence plots display relative influence coefficients and bootstrapped

confidence intervals for the top ten contributing trait predictors. The medians of host probabilities were
ranked and used to identify the top ten candidate host species. When predicting, we set citation counts to
the mean of training data, as a sampling bias correction.
Trait-based model 2: Bayesian additive regression trees
A similar workflow to trait-based model 1 was implemented using Bayesian additive regression trees
(BART), an emerging machine learning tool that has similarities to more popular methods like random
forests and boosted regression trees. BART adds several layers of methodological innovation, and
performs well in bakeoffs with other advanced machine learning methods. Several features make BART
very convenient for modeling projects like these, including several easy-to-use implementations in R
packages, built-in capacity to impute and predict on missing data, and easy construction of variable
importance and partial dependence plots.
Like other classification and regression tree methods, BART assigns the probability of a binary outcome
variable by developing a set of classification trees - in this case, a sum-of-trees model - that split data
(“branches”) and assign values to terminal nodes (“leaves”). Whereas other similar methods generate
uncertainty by adjusting data (e.g. random forests bootstrap training data and fit a tree to each bootstrap;
boosted regression trees are usually implemented with iterated training-test splits to generate confidence
intervals), BART generates uncertainty using an MCMC process. An initial sum-of-trees model is fit to
the entire dataset, and then rulesets are adjusted in a limited and stochastic set of ways (e.g., adding a
split; switching two internal nodes), with the sum-of-trees model backfit to each change. After a burn-in
period, the cumulative set of sum-of-trees models is treated as a posterior distribution. This has some
advantages over other methods, like boosted regression trees or random forests. In particular, posterior
width directly measures model uncertainty (rather than approximating it by permuting training data), and
a single model can be run (instead of an ensemble trained on smaller subsets of training data), allowing
the model to use the full training dataset all at once.105
Unlike many Bayesian machine learning methods, BART is easily implemented out-of-the-box, due to a
limited set of customization needs. Three main priors control the fitting process: one usually-uniform
prior on variable importance, one two-parameter negative power distribution on tree depth (preventing
overfitting), and an inverse chi-squared distribution on residual variance. A set of well-performing priors
from the original BART study106 are widely used across R implementations for out-of-the-box settings,
but can be further adjusted relative to modeling needs. In this study, we implemented BART models
using a Dirichlet prior for variable importance (DART), a specification that is designed for situations with
high dimensionality data that probably reflects a small number of true informative predictors. This often
produces a much more reduced model without going through a stepwise variable selection process, which
can be slow and very subject to stochasticity.105
We implemented this approach using the BART package in R, using the bat-virus association dataset to
generate an outcome variable, and the bat traits dataset as predictors. BART models were implemented
with 200 trees and 10,000 posterior draws, using every trait feature that was at least 50% complete and <
97% homogenous (taken from TBM1).

We tried four total implementations, based on two decisions: BART uncorrected and corrected for
citation counts (BART-u, BART-c), and DART uncorrected and corrected for citation counts (DART-u,
DART-c). All four models performed well, with little variation in predictive power measured by the area
under the receiver operator curve calculated on training data (BART-u: AUC = 0.93; BART-c: AUC =
0.93; DART-u: AUC = 0.93; DART-c: 0.90; Supplemental Figure 7). Across all models, spatial variables
had a high importance, including some regionalization (extent of range) and some variables capturing
larger geographic range sizes, as did a diet of invertebrates (pulling out the phylogenetic signal of
insectivorous bats; Supplemental Figure 8).
All models identified a number of “false negative” hosts that would be suitable based on a 10% false
negative classification threshold for known betacoronavirus hosts (implemented with the R package
‘PresenceAbsence’). BART-u identified 217 missing hosts, BART-c identified 279 missing hosts, DARTu identified 222 missing hosts, and DART-c identified 384 missing hosts, suggesting that this model most
penalized overfitting as intended. As a result, we considered this model the most rigorous and powerful
for inference, and used DART-c in the final model ensemble. We predicted across all 1,040 bats without
recorded betacoronavirus associations, and ranked predicted probability. When predicting, we set citation
counts to the mean of training data, as a sampling bias correction.
Trait-based model 3: Phylogeographic neutral model
We used a previously published pairwise viral sharing model48 to predict potential betacoronavirus hosts
based on the sharing patterns of known hosts in a published dataset 30. We used a generalised additive
mixed model (GAMM), which was fitted in the first half of 2019 using the mgcv package, with pairwise
binary viral sharing (0/1 denoting if a species shares at least one virus) as a response variable.
Explanatory variables include pairwise proportional phylogenetic distance and geographic range overlap
(taken from the IUCN species ranges), with a multi-membership random effect to control for specieslevel sampling biases. The model was then used to predict the probability that a given species pair share
at least one virus across 4196 placental mammals with available data, producing a predicted viral sharing
network that recapitulates a number of known macroecological patterns, as well as predicting reservoir
hosts with surprising accuracy48. Subsetting this predicted sharing matrix, we listed the rank order of hosts
most likely to share with all known betacoronavirus hosts in our datasets.
Rhinolophus-specific implementation of trait-based model 3
We then repeated this process with sharing patterns of Rhinolophus affinis and R. malayanus specifically.
Given the strong phylogenetic effect, the top 139 predictions were bat species: predominantly
rhinolophids and hipposiderids. The top 20 predictions for both R. malayanus and R. affinis are displayed
in Supplemental Tables 3 and 4. Notable predictions included the hog badger Arctonyx collaris
(Carnivora: Mustelidae), which was examined for SARS-CoV antibodies in 2003 and is reported in
wildlife markets7,107; a selection of civet cats (Carnivora: Viverridae) including Viverra species; the
binturong (Arctitis binturong); and the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata), the latter of which were
implicated in the chain of emergence for SARS-CoV49,50; and pangolins (Pholidota: Manidae) including
Manis javanica and Manis pentadactyla, which have been hypothesised to be part of the emergence chain
for SARS-CoV-218,19.

Alongside these high-ranked species-level predictions, we visually examined how predictions varied
across all mammal orders and families using the whole dataset (Supplemental Figure 5). Pangolins
(Pholidota), treeshrews (Scandentia), carnivores (Carnivora), hedgehogs (Erinaceomorpha), and eventoed ungulates (Artiodactyla) had high mean predicted probabilities. Investigating family-level sharing
probabilities revealed that civets (Viverridae) and mustelids (Mustelidae) were responsible for the high
Carnivora probabilities, and mouse deer (Tragulidae) and bovids (Bovidae) were mainly responsible for
high probabilities in the Artiodactyla (Supplemental Figure 5).
Hybrid model 1: Two-Step Kernel Ridge Regression
To make predictions using both the traits and the phylogeny of the hosts, we used Two-Step Kernel Ridge
Regression (TSKRR), a kernel-based pairwise learning method108,109. This method can predict interactions
between two species, i.e., hosts and viruses, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Conceptually, TSKRR
performs nonlinear regression twice: once to generalize to new hosts and once to generalize to new
viruses (Supplemental Figure 9A). As a kernel method, it can exploit arbitrary similarity measures to
describe the species. At the same time, its conceptual simplicity permits using efficient shortcuts for
tuning and specialized cross-validation.
For the hosts, we again restricted ourselves to bats. First, we inputted missing trait values using the
MissForest package110. We then selected the relevant traits, standardized them, and computed the squared
Euclidean distance. We plugged this distance into a standard radial basis kernel111, where we used the
median heuristic to set the bandwidth. Similarly, for the bat phylogeny, we computed the distance matrix.
We combined this distance with the radial basis kernel, again setting the bandwidth by the median of the
distances. Bats were described using a kernel matrix derived from traits, phylogeny, or the average of
both (Supplemental Figure 9B). We corrected for sampling bias by including the number of citations per
species as a covariate and predicted using the average number of citations for all hosts. For viruses, we
used a simple kernel with a “1” if two virus genera belong to the same family, and a “0” elsewise. For all
the kernel matrices, we added 0.1 to each element and an additional 0.1 to the diagonal elements. This
modification serves as an intercept and it gives the TSKRR the same capacity as the linear filtering
method described earlier108.
We fitted the models using the R package xnet. We assessed model performance in two ways. First, we
used leave-one-out for every element of the incidence matrix and computed the AUC over all predicted
interactions. Secondly, we used leave-one-out cross-validation on bats(i.e., leaving out a single species,
making predictions for all the viruses of that bat, and repeating this for every species). In this setting, we
computed the AUC for every virus over all bats and averaged these values (Supplemental Figure 9C). For
both evaluation strategies, we removed viruses with no hosts in the dataset, although we kept these for
training the model (Supplementary Table 7). Compared to the average performance for the viruses,
betacoronaviruses were slightly more difficult to predict. Phylogeny was slightly more informative than
traits, although the effect between them was synergistic. As would be expected, it was easier to predict
missing interactions than to predict new hosts.

To assess which variables are most important, we computed feature importance based on random
permutations. We randomly reshuffled one or both of the bats’ kernel matrices, destroying its information
content. Subsequently, we recorded the decrease in AUC for the setting ‘interactions’ in the model as an
indication of relative importance. We also randomly reshuffled each trait separately and monitored the
effect on performance. We repeated each random permutation 100 times. Reshuffling the complete kernel
matrix with both traits and phylogeny resulted in the largest average drop in AUC of 0.1904
(Supplementary Figure 10). Reshuffling only the phylogeny kernel matrix had a much more profound
impact than the trait matrix (0.07769 vs. 0.05301). Contributions of traits were smaller by comparison.
Citation count was the largest effect (0.02119), with diet breadth (0.00520), population group size
(0.003802), and annual birth pulse (0.0022944) as the remaining largest contributions. Removing
citations resulted in a stronger importance for these variables but did not change the relative importance.
Consensus Methods and Recommendations
Combining and ranking predictions
For all eight models predicting bat hosts of betacoronaviruses, and five models predicting mammal hosts
of betacoronaviruses, we combined predictions—generated using the same standardized data—into one
standardized dataset. All mammal models were trained on data including bats, but predictions were subset
to exclude bats to focus on likely intermediate hosts.
Each study’s unique output—a non-intercomparable mix of different definitions of suitability or
probability of association—were transformed into proportional rank, where lower rank indicates higher
evidence for association out of the total number of hosts examined. By rescaling all results to proportional
ranks between zero and one, we also allowed comparison of in-sample and out-of-sample predictions
across all models. Proportional ranks were averaged across models to generate one standardized list of
predictions. This absorbed much of the variation in model performance (Supplemental Figure 1) and
produced a set of rankings that performed well.
We elected not to withhold any “test” data to measure model performance, given that each method
deployed in the ensemble has been independently and rigorously tested and validated in previous
publications. Instead, to maximize the amount of available training data for every model, we used full
datasets in each model and measured performance on the full training data.
For bats, the final ensemble of models spanned a large range of performance on the training data,
measured by the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC; Network 1: 0.624; Network 2: 0.987;
Network 3: 0.514; Network 4: 0.726; Trait 1: 0.850; Trait 2: 0.902; Trait 3: 0.762; Hybrid 1: 0.924),
indicating that it was possible to suitably detect differences in model performance on the full data. The
total ensemble of proportional ranks performed medium well (AUC = 0.832). We used known
betacoronavirus associations to threshold each model and the ensemble predictions based on a 10%
omission threshold (90% sensitivity), and we again found a wide range in the number of predicted
undiscovered bat hosts of betacoronaviruses (Network 1: 162 species; Network 2: 1; Network 3: 111;
Network 4: 44; Trait 1: 425; Trait 2: 384; Trait 3: 720; Hybrid 1: 181; total ensemble: 239 species). Given

concerns about mammal model performance and biological accuracy (see Main Text), we elected not to
apply this exercise to mammal hosts at large.
To visualize the spatial distribution of predicted bat hosts, we used the IUCN Red List database of species
geographic distributions. We took the top 50 ranked in-sample predictions and top 50 ranked out-ofsample predictions and combined these range maps to visualize species richness of top predicted hosts
(Figure 3).
Phylogenetic factorization of ensemble models
We used phylogenetic factorization to flexibly identify taxonomic patterns in the consensus proportional
rankings of likely hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Phylogenetic factorization is a graph-partitioning algorithm that
iteratively partitions a phylogeny in a series of generalized linear models to identify clades at any
taxonomic level (e.g., rather than a priori comparing strictly among genera or family) that differ in a trait
of interest 45. Using the mammal supertree, we used the phylofactor package to partition proportional rank
as a Gaussian-distributed variable. We determined the number of significant phylogenetic factors using a
Holm's sequentially rejective 5% cutoff for the family-wise error rate. We applied this algorithm across
our four final ensemble prediction datasets: in-sample bat ranks, out-of-sample bat ranks, in-sample
mammal ranks, and out-of-sample mammal ranks.
Using network and trait-based models within-sample, we identified only one bat clade with substantially
compared to 0.39 for the
remaining bat phylogeny, the Yinpterochiroptera). Out of sample, using only trait-based models, we
instead identified eight bat clades with different propensities to include unlikely or likely bat hosts of

betacoronaviruses. Subclades of the New World superfamily Noctilionoidea broadly had higher
proportional ranks (x=0.73), indicating lower predicted probability of being hosts, as did the
Emballanuridae (x=0.75). In contrast, both the Rhinolophidae and the Pteropodidae broadly had lower
mean ranks (x=0.29 and x=0.38).
Using network models within-sample across non-volant mammals, we identified four clades with
different proportional ranks. The largest clade was the Laurasiatheria (Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla,
Carnivora, Pholidota, Soricomorpha, and Erinaceomorpha), which had lower proportional ranks (higher
risk; x=0.55). Nested within this clade, the Cetacea had greater proportional ranks (x=0.89),
indicating lower risk. A large subclade of the Murinae (Old World rats and mice) also had lower ranks
(x=0.52). Out of sample, using only the biogeographic viral sharing model, we instead identified 15
clades with different proportional ranks. The first clade identified large swaths of the Muridae as having
higher risk (x=0.38) as well as the Laurasiatheria (x=0.50). Old World primates had weakly lower risk
(x=0.65), as did the Scuridae (x=0.67). The Cetacea and Pinnipedia both had greater proportional
ranks (x=0.89 and x=0.71). Old World porcupines (Hystricidae) and the Erinaceidae (Paraechinus,
Hemiechinus, Mesechinus, Erinaceus, Atelerix) both had greater risk (x=0.48 and x=0.39), while the
Afrosoricida had higher ranks (x=0.97).
To assess potential discrepancy between taxonomic patterns in model ensemble predictions and those of
simply host betacoronavirus status itself, we ran a secondary phylogenetic factorization treating host

status as a Bernoulli-distributed variable, with the same procedure applied to determine the number of
significant phylogenetic factors. To assess sensitivity of taxonomic patterns to sampling effort, we ran
phylogenetic factorization with and without square-root transformed PubMed citations per species as a
weighting variable (Supplemental Figure 11).
Without accounting for study effort, phylogenetic factorization of betacoronavirus host status identified
one significant clade across the bat phylogeny, the Yangochiroptera, as having fewer positive species
(4.71%) than the paraphyletic remainder (12.12%). When accounting for study effort, however, the single
clade identified by phylogenetic factorization changed, with a subclade of the family Pteropodidae (the
Rousettinae) having a greater proportion of positive species (28.6%). For non-volant mammals,
phylogenetic factorization identified only one clade, the family Camelidae, as having more positive
species (75%) than the tree remainder (0.68%).
Phylogenetic factorization of Rhinolophidae virus sharing
Because phylogenetic patterns in predictions from our viral sharing model could vary across other
taxonomic scales beyond order and family, we also used phylogenetic factorization to more flexibly
identify host clades with different propensities to share viruses with R. affinis and R. malayanus. We
partitioned rank as a Gaussian-distributed variable and again determined the number of significant
phylogenetic factors using Holm's sequentially rejective 5% cutoff.
Within the Chiroptera, we identified 10 clades with different propensities to share viruses with R. affinis
and 5 clades with different propensities to share viruses with R. malayanus. For both bats, the top clade
was the family Rhinolophidae, reinforcing phylogenetic components of the biogeographic model and
highlighting the greater likelihood of viral sharing (mean rank x=40 for R. affinis, x=42 for R.
malayanus). For R. affinis, several individual bat species had lower risks of viral sharing (e.g., Myotis
leibii, x=4100; Pteropus insularis, x=3157; Nyctimene aello, x=2497; Chaerephon chapini,
x=2497). The Megadermatidae, Nycteridae, and Hipposideridae (under which the PanTHERIA dataset
includes the genus Rhinonicteris, although this is now considered a separate family, the
Rhinonycteridae112) collectively had greater likelihood of viral sharing (x=557), as did the
Vespertillionidae (x=704).
Across the non-volant mammals, we identified 7 clades with different propensities to share viruses with
R. affinis and only 1 clade with different propensities to share viruses with R. malayanus. For both bat
species, the first and primary clade was the Ferungulata (Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Carnivora,
Pholidota, Soricomorpha, and Erinaceomorpha), which had lower ranks (higher viral sharing; x=2084).
For viral sharing with R. affinis, the Sciuridae was more likely to share viruses (x=1948), as was the
Scandentia (x=1416) and many members of the Colobinae (x=1958). However, members of the tribe
Muntiacini (genera Elaphodus and Muntiacus) had especially high likelihoods of viral sharing and low
rank (x=361).

Supplemental Table 6. Data scale of prediction, by method. Some methods use pseudoabsences to
expand the scale of prediction but still only analyze existing data, with no out-of-sample inference, while
others can predict freshly onto new data. (* Training data from the HP3 database uses pseudoabsences,
but no new ones are generated in this study that modify the model or the bat-virus association dataset)

Supplemental Figure 1. Bat models perform more strongly together than in isolation. Curves show
observed betacoronavirus hosts against predicted proportional ranks from eight individual models, and
incorporated into one multi-model ensemble. Black lines show a binomial GLM fit to the predicted ranks
against the recorded presence or absence of known betacoronavirus associations. Points are jittered to
reduce overlap.

Supplemental Figure 2. Poor concordance among predictive models for mammal hosts of
betacoronaviruses. The pairwise Spearman’s rank correlations between models’ ranked species-level
predictions were generally low (A). In-sample predictions varied significantly and heavily prioritized
domestic animals and well-studied hosts (B). The ten species with the highest mean proportional ranks
across all models are highlighted in shades of purple. Only in-sample predictions are displayed because
only one model (Trait-based 3) was able to predict out of sample for all mammals.

Supplemental Figure 3. Results of phylogenetic factorization applied to predicted ranks of virus sharing
with Rhinolophus affinis and Rhinolophus malayanus. Colored regions indicate clades identified as
significantly different in their predicted rank compared to the paraphyletic remainder; those more likely to
share a virus with the Rhinolophus are shown in red, whereas those less likely to share a virus are shown
in blue. Bar height indicates predicted rank (higher values = lower rank score, more likely share virus).
Results are displayed for bats and remaining mammals separately. Mammal-wide clades with high
propensities to share viruses with R. affinis based solely on their phylogeography included the treeshrews
(Scandentia), Old World monkeys (Colobinae), and both tufted and barking deer (Muntiacini).

Supplemental Figure 6. To account for uncertainty in the phylogenetic distances among hosts, the
scaled-phylogeny model estimates a tree scaling parameter (eta) based on an early-burst model of
evolution. On the left is the unscaled bat phylogeny for the hosts in the bat-virus genera network, and on
the right is the same tree rescaled according to mean estimated scaling parameter (eta = 7.92). Eta values
above 1 indicate accelerating evolution, suggesting less phylogenetic conservatism in host-virus
associations among closely related taxa than would be predicted by a Brownian-motion model on the
unscaled tree.

Supplemental Figure 7. Four formulations of Bayesian additive regression tree (BART) models produce
ce
slightly different results, but largely agree. Two models use baseline BART, while two models use a
re
Dirichlet prior on variable importance (DART). Two are uncorrected for sampling bias (u) while two are
el
corrected using citation counts (c). In the final main-text model ensemble, we present a DART model
nd
including correction for citation bias, which penalizes overfitting and spurious patterns two ways and
leads to predictions with a lower total correlation with the data, but a still-high performance (AUC =
0.90).

Supplemental Figure 9. Overview of the two-step kernel ridge regression (TSKRR) method. A. The
he
nd
incidence matrix Y is modelled by two kernel matrices K and G, describing the hosts (here: bats) and
viruses, respectively. The equations for fitting the model and making predictions are given below. B.
Computing the host kernel matrix is done based on traits, phylogeny or both. A standard radial basis
sis
kernel is used to transform a distance to a valid kernel. The two kernels are combined by averaging. C.
on
The models are validated by specialized cross-validation. The setting interactions leaves one interaction
ng
out at a time and repeats this for every interaction. AUC is computed in micro-fashion. In the setting
hosts, we leave out one host at a time and compute the AUC per virus, averaging the individual results. D.
he
To assess the variable importance, we first randomly reshuffle the kernel matrices and monitor how the
performance of a model fitted on these data drops. In a more fine-grained approach, we just reshuffle a
single trait (indicated by the red arrow) and compare the resulting performances.
