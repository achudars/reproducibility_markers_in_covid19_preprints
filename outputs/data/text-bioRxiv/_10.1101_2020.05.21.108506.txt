Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which jumped into the
human population in late 2019 from a currently uncharacterised animal reservoir. Due to this
extremely recent association with humans, SARS-CoV-2 may not yet be fully adapted to its
human host. This has led to speculations that some lineages of SARS-CoV-2 may be evolving
towards

higher

transmissibility.

The

natural selection are those which have emerged repeatedly and independently (homoplasies).
Here, we formally test whether any of the recurrent mutations that have been observed in
SARS-CoV-2 are significantly associated with increased viral transmission. To do so, we develop
a phylogenetic index to quantify the relative number of descendants in sister clades with and
without a specific allele. We apply this index to a carefully curated set of recurrent mutations
identified within a dataset of 46,723 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from patients worldwide.

appear to be evolutionary neutral. Recurrent mutations also seem primarily induced by the
human immune system via host RNA editing, rather than being signatures of adaptation to the
novel human host. In conclusion, we find no evidence at this stage for the emergence of
significantly more transmissible lineages of SARS-CoV-2 due to recurrent mutations.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Covid19, is a positive single-stranded RNA virus that jumped into the human population towards the
end of 2019 [1-4] from a yet uncharacterised zoonotic reservoir [5]. Since then, the virus has
gradually accumulated mutations leading to patterns of genomic diversity. These mutations
can be used both to track the spread of the pandemic and to identify sites putatively under
selection as SARS-CoV-2 potentially adapts to its new human host. Large-scale efforts from the

warranted here for two reasons. First, the unprecedented and growing number of SARS-CoV-2
assemblies calls for the development of computationally fast methods that scale effectively

with datasets. Second, and more importantly, the genetic diversity of the SARS-CoV-2
population lacks strong structure at a global level due to the large number of independent
introductions of the virus in most densely sampled countries [1]. This leads to the worldwide
distribution of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity being fairly homogenous, thus minimising the risk
that a homoplasic mutation could be deemed to provide a fitness advantage to its viral carrier
simply because it is overrepresented, by chance, in regions of the world more conducive to
transmission.
In this work, we make use of curated alignment comprising 46,723 SARS-CoV-2 assemblies to
formally test whether any identified recurrent mutation is involved in altering viral fitness. We
find that none of the recurrent SARS-CoV-2 mutations tested are associated with significantly
increased viral transmission. Instead, recurrent mutations seem to be primarily induced by
host immunity through RNA editing mechanisms, and likely tend to be selectively neutral, with
no or only negligible effects on virus transmissibility.
Results

Global diversity of SARS-CoV-2

The global genetic diversity of 46,723 SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies is presented as a
maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree (Figure 1A). No assemblies were found to deviate by
more than 32 SNPs from the reference genome, Wuhan-Hu-1, which is consistent with the
relatively recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 towards the latter portion of 2019 [1-5]. We
informally estimated the mutation rate over our alignment as 9.8 x 10 substitutions per site
per year, which is consistent with previous rates estimated for SARS-CoV-2 [1-4] (Figure S1-S2).
This rate also falls in line with those observed in other coronaviruses [25, 26], and is fairly
unremarkable relative to other positive single-stranded RNA viruses, which do not have a viral
proof-reading mechanism [27, 28].

into sublineages [29]. Our dataset includes viruses sequenced from 99 countries

(Figure 1B, Table S1), with a good temporal coverage (Figure S1B). While some countries are
far more densely sampled than others (Figure 1B), the emerging picture is that fairly limited
geographic structure is observed in the viruses in circulation in any one region. All major clades
in the global diversity of SARS-CoV-2 are represented in various regions of the world (Figure
1A, Figure S3), and the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in circulation in different continents is
fairly uniform (Figure 1C, Figure S3).

Distribution of recurrent mutations
Across the alignment we detected 12,706 variable positions, with an observed genomewide
ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions of 1.88 (calculated from Table S2).
Following masking of putatively artefactual sites and phylogeny reconstruction we detected
over 5,000 homoplasic positions (5,710 and 5,793 respectively using two different masking
criteria), see Methods and Figures S4-S5, Table S3. However, recurrent mutations may arise as
a result of sequencing or genome assembly artefacts [30]. In line with our previous work ([1];
see Methods) we therefore applied two stringent filtering approaches to delineate sets of well
supported homoplasic sites which present strong candidates to test for ongoing selection. This
resulted in 398 and 411 homoplasic sites in the alignments, respectively (Figures S4-S5, Table
S3).

by analysing simulated nucleotide alignments and discrete traits randomly assigned onto the
global SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny (see Methods, Figure S11).

We restricted the analysis of the global SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny to homoplasies determined to
have arisen at least n=3 times independently. We observed 185 and 199 homoplasies passing
all the RoHO score criteria under the more and less stringent masking procedures,
respectively, and report in the main text the results obtained with the more stringent masking.
We ignored all homoplasic events where the parent node led to fewer than two descendant
tips carying the ancestral allele and two with the derived allele (Figure 2). In order to avoid
pseudoreplication (i.e. scoring any genome more than once), we also discarded from the RoHO
index calculations for any homoplasic parent node embedding a secondary homoplasic event
involving the same site in the alignment (Figure 2). Ignoring embedding homoplasic parent
nodes led to only a marginal loss of statistical power and inclusion of homoplasies carried on
embedded nodes yielded similar results (Figure S11b). Results were consistent for the
alternative, less stringent, masking strategy (Figure S11c, Table S4).

Schematic depicting the rationale behind the Ratio of Homoplasic Offspring (RoHO) score index.
White tips correspond to an isolate carrying the reference allele and red tips correspond to the
homoplasic allele. This schematic phylogeny comprises three highlighted internal nodes annotated as
corresponding to an ancestor that acquired a homoplasy. Node 3 is not considered because it fails our
criterion of having at least two descendant tips carrying either allele. Node 1 is not considered because
it includes embedded children nodes themselves annotated as carrying a homoplasic mutation. Node 2
meets our criteria: its RoHO score is 4/2 = 2. In order to consider RoHO score for a homoplasic position,
at least n=3 nodes have to satisfy the criteria (not illustrated in the figure).
Figure 2

None of the 185 detected recurrent mutations having emerged independently a minimum of
three times were statistically significantly associated with an increase in viral transmission for
either tested alignment (paired t-test; Figure 3 and Table S4, Figure S11). We also did not
identify any recurrent mutations statistically significantly associated with reduced viral
transmissibility for the more stringently masked alignment. Instead the entire set of 185
recurrent mutations seem to fit the expectation for neutral evolution with respect to
transmissibility, with a mean and median overall Log10RoHO score of -0.001 and and -0.02.
Moreover, the distribution of individual site-specific RoHO scores is symmetrically distributed
around 0 with 97/185 mean positive values and 88/185 negative ones. To summarise, we
would expect that recurrent mutations should be the best candidates for putative adaptation
of SARS-CoV-2 to its novel human host. However, none of the recurrent mutations in
circulation to date shows evidence of being associated with viral transmissibility.

Discussion

In this work, we analysed a dataset of over 46,700 SARS-CoV-2 assemblies sampled across 99
different countries and all major continental regions. Current patterns of genomic diversity
highlight multiple introductions in all continents (Figure 1, Figures S1-S3) since the host-switch
to humans in late 2019 [1-4]. Although SARS-CoV-2 at present is effectively a single lineage
with limited diversity within it, the gradual accumulation of mutations in viral genomes in
circulation may offer early clues to adaptation to its novel human host. Across our dataset we
identified a total of 12,706 mutations, heavily enriched in C U transitions, of which we
identified 398 strongly supported recurrent mutations (Table S3, Figures S4-S5). Employing a
newly devised index (Ratio of Homoplasic Offspring; RoHO) to test whether any of these
mutations contribute to a change in transmission, we found no mutation to be convincingly
associated with a significant increase or decrease in transmissibility (Figures 2-3, Table S4).
Given the importance of monitoring potential changes in virus transmissibility, several other
studies have investigated whether particular sets of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 are associated
with changes in transmission and virulence [15, 21, 38]. We strongly caution that efforts to
determine if any specific mutation contributes to a change in viral phenotype, using solely
genomic approaches, relies on the ability to distinguish between changes in allele frequency
due to demographic or epidemiological processes, compared to those driven by selection [22].
A convenient and powerful alternative is to focus on sites which have emerged recurrently
(homoplasies), as we do here. While such a method is obviously restricted to such recurrent
mutations, it reduces the effect of demographic confounding problems such as founder bias.

A much discussed mutation in the context of demographic confounding is D614G (nucleotide
position 23,403), a nonsynonymous change in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Korber et al.
suggested that D614G increases transmissibility but with no measurable effect on patient
infection outcome [21]. Other studies have suggested associations with increased infectivity in
vitro [18, 39] and antigenicity [40]. Here, we conversely find that D614G does not associate
with significantly increased viral transmission (Median log10(RoHO)=0, paired t-test p=0.28;
Table S4), in line with our results for all other tested recurrent mutations. Though clearly,
choice of methodology may lead to different conclusions. A recent study on a sample of
25,000 whole genome sequences exclusively from the UK used different approaches to
investigate D614G. Not all analyses found a conclusive signal for D614G, and effects on
transmission, when detected, appeared relatively moderate [38].
These apparently contrasting results for D614G should be considered carefully. What is
however indisputable is that D614G emerged early in the pandemic and is now found at high
frequency globally, with 36,347 assemblies in our dataset (77.8%) carrying the derived allele
(Figure 1a, Table S3). However, D614G is also in linkage disequilibrium with three other
derived mutations (nucleotide positions 241, 3037 and 14,408) that have experienced highly
similar expansions, as 98.9% of accessions with D614G also carry these derived alleles
(35,954/36,347). It should be noted that the D614G mutation displays only five independent
emergences that qualify for inclusion in our analyses (fewer than the other three sites it is
associated with). While this limits our power to detect a statistically significant association
with transmissibility, the low number of independent emergences suggests to us that the
abundance of D614G is more probably a demographic artefact: D614G went up in frequency as
the SARS-CoV-2 population expanded, largely due to a founder effect originating from one of
the deepest branches in the global phylogeny, rather than being a driver of transmission itself.
The RoHO index developed here provides an intuitive metric to quantify the association
between a given mutation and viral transmission. However, we acknowledge this approach has
some limitations. We have, for example, relied on admittedly arbitrary choices concerning the
number of minimal observations and nodes required to conduct statistical testing. While it
seems unlikely this would change our overall conclusions, which are highly consistent for two
tested alignments, results for particular mutations should be considered in light of this caveat
and may change as more genomes become available. Further, our approach necessarily entails
some loss of information and therefore statistical power. This is because our motivation to test
independent occurrences means that we do not handle "embedded homoplasies" explicitly:
we simply discard them (Figure 2), although inclusion of embedded homoplasies does not
change the overall conclusions (Figure S11b). Finally, while our approach is undoubtedly more
robust to demographic confounding (such as founder bias), it is impossible to completely
remove all the sources of bias that come with the use of available public genomes.
In addition, it is of note that the SARS-CoV-2 population has only acquired moderate genetic
diversity since its jump into the human population and, consequently, most branches in the
phylogenetic tree are only supported by very few mutations. As a result of the low genetic
diversity, most nodes in the tree have only low statistical support [41]. This prompted us to
apply a series of stringent filters and masking strategies to the alignment (see Methods). Also,
while our method does not account quantitatively for phylogenetic uncertainty, we only
computed RoHO scores for situations which should be phylogenetically robust (i.e. mutations
represented in at least three replicate nodes, each with at least two representatives of the
reference and alternate allele in descendants).
We further acknowledge that the number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available at this stage of the
pandemic, whilst extensive, still provides us only with moderate power to detect statistically

significant associations with transmissibility for any individual recurrent mutation (Figure S12).
The statistical power of the RoHO score methodology depends primarily on the number of
independent homoplasic replicates rather than the strength of selection (Figure S12). The
number of usable replicates per homoplasic site ranges between 3-14, and 3-67 for the two
masking strategies we applied (Table S4). While the statistical power at most sites is weak, we
predict a higher number of replicates at sites under strong positive selection, due to the
expected recurrent mutations to the beneficial allelic state. We acknowledge that more
sophisticated methods for phylodynamic modelling of viral fitness do exist [24, 42, 43],
however, these are not directly portable to SARS-CoV-2 and would be too computationally
demanding for a dataset of this size. Our approach, which is deliberately simple and makes
minimal assumptions, is conversely highly scalable as the number of available SARS-CoV-2
genome sequences continues to rapidly increase.
To date, the fact that none of the 185 recurrent mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 population we
identified as candidates for putative adaptation to its novel human host are statistically
significantly associated to transmission suggests that the vast majority of mutations
segregating at reasonable frequency are largely neutral in the context of transmission and viral
fitness. This interpretation is supported by the essentially perfect spread of individual RoHO
index scores around their expectation under neutral evolution (Figure 3). However, it is
nonetheless interesting to consider the cause of these mutations. Notably, 65% of the
detected mutations comprise nonsynonymous changes of which 38% derive from C U
transitions. This high compositional bias, as also detected in other studies [34-36], as well as in
other members of the Coronaviridae [31-33], suggests that mutations observed in the SARSCoV-2 genome are not solely the result of errors by the viral RNA polymerase during virus
replication [35, 36]. One possibility is the action of human RNA editing systems which have
been implicated in innate and adaptive immunity. These include the AID/APOBEC family of
cytidine deaminases which catalyse deamination of cytidine to uridine in RNA or DNA and the
ADAR family of adenosine deaminases which catalyse deamination of adenosine to inosine
(recognized as a guanosine during translation) in RNA [44, 45].
The exact targets of these host immune RNA editing mechanisms are not fully characterized,
but comprise viral nucleotide sequence target motifs whose editing may leave characteristic
biases in the viral genome [37, 46, 47]. For example, detectable depletion of the preferred
APOBEC3 target dinucleotides sequence TC have been reported in papillomaviruses [48]. In the
context of SARS-CoV-2, Simmonds [36] and Di Giorgio et al. [35] both highlight the potential of
APOBEC-mediated cytosine deamination as an underlying biological mechanism driving the
over-representation of C U mutations. However, APOBEC3 was shown to result in cytosine
deamination but not hypermutation of HCoV-NL63 in vitro [49], which may suggest that
additional biological processes also play a role.
In summary, our results do not point to any candidate recurrent mutation significantly
increasing transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 at this stage and confirm that the genomic diversity
of the global SARS-CoV-2 population is currently still very limited. It is to be expected that
SARS-CoV-2 will diverge into phenotypically different lineages as it establishes itself as an
endemic human pathogen. However, there is no a priori reason to believe that this process will
lead to the emergence of any lineage with increased transmission ability in its human host.

Methods

Data acquisition

48,454 SARS-CoV-2 assemblies were downloaded from GISAID on 30/07/2020 selecting only
those marked as ‘complete’, ‘low coverage exclude’ and ‘high coverage only’. To this dataset,
all assemblies of total genome length less than 29,700bp were removed, as were any with a
fraction of ‘N’ nucleotides >5%. In addition, all animal isolate strains were removed, including
those from bat, pangolin, mink, cat and tiger. All samples flagged by NextStrain as ‘exclude’
(https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/blob/master/config/exclude.txt) as of 30/07/2020 were
also removed. 21 further accessions were also filtered from our phylogenetic analyses as they
appeared as major outliers following phylogenetic inference and application of TreeShrink [50]
despite passing other filtering checks. This left 46,723 assemblies for downstream analysis. A
full metadata table, list of acknowledgements and exclusions is provided in Table S1.
Multiple sequence alignment and maximum likelihood tree

All 46,723 assemblies were aligned against the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (GenBank
NC_045512.2, GISAID EPI_ISL_402125) using MAFFT [51] implemented in the rapid
phylodynamic alignment pipeline provided by Augur (github.com/nextstrain/augur). This
resulted in a 29,903 nucleotide alignment. As certain sites in the alignment have been flagged
as putative sequencing errors (http://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencingdata/473), we followed two separate masking strategies. The first masking strategy is designed
to test the impact of the inclusion of putative sequencing errors in phylogenetic inference,
masking several sites within the genome (n=68) together with the first 55 and last 100 sites of
the alignment (the list of sites flagged as ‘mask’ is available at https://github.com/WL/ProblematicSites_SARS-CoV2/blob/master/problematic_sites_sarsCov2.vcf,
accessed
30/07/2020) [30]. We also employed a less stringent approach, following the masking strategy
employed by NextStrain which masks only positions 18,529, 29,849, 29,851 and 29,853 as well
as the first 130 and last 50 sites of the alignment. A complete list of masked positions is
provided in Table S5. This resulted in two masked alignments of 46,723 and 46,745 assemblies
with 12,706 and 12,807 SNPs respectively.
Subsequently, for both alignments, a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was built using IQTREE 2.1.0 Covid release (https://github.com/iqtree/iqtree2/releases/tag/v2.1.0) as the treebuilding method [52]. The resulting phylogenies were viewed and annotated using ggtree [53]
(Figure 1, Figure S1). Site numbering and genome structure are provided for available
annotations (non-overlapping open reading frames) using Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512.2) as
reference.
Phylogenetic dating

We informally estimated the substitution rate and time to the most recent common ancestor
of both masked alignments by computing the root-to-tip temporal regression implemented in
BactDating [54]. Both alignments exhibit a significant correlation between the genetic distance
from the root and the time of sample collection following 10,000 random permutations of
sampling date (Figure S2).

The resulting maximum likelihood trees were used, together with the input alignments, to
rapidly identify recurrent mutations (homoplasies) using HomoplasyFinder [1, 55].
HomoplasyFinder employs the method first described by Fitch [56], providing, for each site,
the site specific consistency index and the minimum number of changes invoked on the
phylogenetic tree. All ambiguous sites in the alignment were set to ‘N’. HomoplasyFinder
identified a total of 5,710 homoplasies, which were distributed over the SARS-CoV-2 genome
(Figure S4). For the less stringent masking of the alignment, HomoplasyFinder identified a total
of 5,793 homoplasies (Figure S5).
As previously described, we filtered both sets of identified homoplasies using a set of
thresholds attempting to circumvent potential assembly/sequencing errors (filtering scripts
are available at https://github.com/liampshaw/CoV-homoplasy-filtering and see reference
[1]). Here we only considered homoplasies present in >46 isolates (0.1% of isolates in the
dataset), where the number of submitting and originating laboratories of isolates with the
homoplasy was >1 and displaying a third allele frequency <0.2 of that of the second allele
frequency. This avoids us taking forward homoplasies which have only been identified in a
single location. This resulted in 398 filtered sites (411 following a less stringent masking
procedure) of which 397 overlap. A full list of sites is provided for both alignments in Table S3.
In addition, we considered an additional filtering criterion to identify homoplasic sites falling
close to homopolymer regions, which may be more prone to sequencing error. We defined
homopolymer regions as positions on the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference with at least four repeated
nucleotides. While homopolymer regions can arise through meaningful biological mechanisms,
for example polymerase slippage, such regions have also been implicated in increased error
rates for both nanopore [57] and Illumina sequencing [58]. As such, homoplasies detected
near these regions (± 1 nt) could have arisen due to sequencing error rather than solely as a
result of underlying biological mechanisms. If this were true, we would expect the proportion
of homoplasic sites near these regions to be greater than that of homopolymeric positions
across the entire genome. We tested this by identifying homopolymer regions using a custom
python script (https://github.com/cednotsed/genome_homopolymer_counter) and
performing a binomial test on the said proportions. A list of homopolymer regions across the
genome is provided in Table S6. 25 of the 398 (6.3%) filtered homoplasies were within ± 1 nt of
homopolymer regions and this proportion was significantly lower as compared to that of
homopolymeric positions across the reference (9.7%; p = 0.009504). As such, we did not
exclude homopolymer-associated homoplasies and suggest that these sites are likely to be
biologically meaningful.
To determine if systematic biases were introduced in our filtering steps, we performed a
principal component analysis (PCA) on the unfiltered list of homoplasies obtained from
HomoplasyFinder (n = 5,710). The input space of the PCA included 11 variables, of which eight
were dummy-coded reference/variant nucleotides and a further three corresponded to the
minimum number of changes on tree, SNP count and consistency index output by
HomoplasyFinder. Visualisation of PCA projections (Figure S8a) suggested that there was no
hidden structure introduced by our homoplasy filtering steps. The first two principle
components accounted for 56% of the variance and were mostly loaded by the variables
encoding the reference and variant nucleotides (Figure S8b).
Annotation and characterisation of homoplasic sites

All variable sites across the coding regions of the genomes were identified as synonymous or
non-synonymous. This was done by retrieving the amino acid changes corresponding to all
SNPs at these positions using a custom Biopython (v.1.76) script

(https://github.com/cednotsed/nucleotide_to_AA_parser.git). The ORF coordinates used
(including the ORF1ab ribosomal frameshift site) were obtained from the associated metadata
according to Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512.2).
To determine if certain types of SNPs are overrepresented in homoplasic sites, we computed
the base count ratios and cumulative frequencies of the different types of SNPs across all
SARS-CoV-2 genomes at homoplasic and/or non-homoplasic sites (Figures S6-S7). In addition,
we identified the sequence context of all variable positions in the genome (± 1 and ± 2
neighbouring bases from these positions) and computed the frequencies of the resultant 3mers (Figure S9) and 5-mers (Figure S10).
Quantifying pathogen fitness (transmission)

Under random sampling we expect that a mutation that positively affects a pathogen’s
transmission fitness will be represented in proportionally more descendant nodes. As such, a
pathogen’s fitness can be expressed simply as the number of descendant nodes from the
direct ancestor of the strain having acquired the mutation, relative to the number of
descendants without the mutation (schematic Figure 2). We define this as the Ratio of
Homoplasic Offspring (RoHO) index (full associated code available at
https://github.com/DamienFr/RoHO).
HomoplasyFinder [55] flags all nodes of a phylogeny corresponding to an ancestor that
acquired a homoplasy. We only considered nodes with at least two descending tips carrying
either allele and with no children node embedded carrying a subsequent mutation at the same
site (see Figure 2). For each such node in the tree we counted the number of isolates of each
allele and computed the RoHO index. We finally restricted our analysis to homoplasies having
at least n=3 individual RoHO indices (i.e. for which three independent lineages acquired the
mutation). The latter allows us to consider only nodes for which we have multiple supported
observations within the phylogeny. Paired t-tests were computed for each homoplasy to test
whether RoHO indices were significantly different from zero. To validate the methodology, this
analysis was carried out on data analysed using two different masking strategies (Figure 3,
Figure S11, masked sites available in Table S5). Full metadata associated with each tested site,
including the number and associated countries of descendant offsprings are provided in Table
S4.
Assessing RoHO performance

To assess the performance of our RoHO index, we performed a set of simulations designed to
test the distribution of RoHO values under a neutral model.
We simulated a 10,000 nucleotide alignment comprising 1,000 accessions using the rtree()
simulator available in Ape v5.3 [59] and genSeq from the R package PhyTools v0.7-2.0 [60]
using a single rate transition matrix multiplied by a rate of 6x10 to approximately match that
estimated in [1]. This generated a 8,236 SNP alignment which was run through the treebuilding and homoplasy detection algorithms described for the true data; identifying 3,097
homoplasies (pre-filtering). Specifying a minimum of three replicates and at least two
descendant tips of each allele, we obtained a set of RoHO scores none of which differed
significantly from zero (Figure S11e).
-4

In parallel we tested for any bias in the RoHO scores when a set of randomly generated
discrete traits were simulated onto the true maximum likelihood phylogeny. To do so we
employed the discrete character simulator rTraitDisc() available through Ape [59] specifying an

equilibrium frequency of 1 (i.e. neutrality) and a normalised rate of 0.002 (after dividing
branch lengths by the mean edge length). This rate value was manually chosen to
approximately reproduce patterns of homoplasies similar to those observed for homoplasies
of the actual phylogeny. Simulations were repeated for 100 random traits. Considering the
discrete simulated traits as variant (putative homoplasic) sites, we again evaluated the RoHO
indices (applying filters mentioned previously) for these 100 neutral traits. Following
Bonferroni correction, no sites were deemed statistically significant (Figure S11d).
In all cases, to mitigate the introduction of bias we only considered homoplasies with nodes
with at least two tips carrying either allele, in order to avoid 1/n and n/1 comparisons (see
node 3 in Figure 2). We further enforced a minimum number of three replicates (Figure 3,
Figure S11, Table S4). While we discarded homoplasies located on ‘embedded nodes’ to avoid
pseudoreplication (see node 1 in Figure 2), we note that including such sites has no impact on
our results (Figure S11b).
In addition we assessed the statistical power to detect significant deviations from neutrality of
the RoHO index according to (i) the number of independent emergences of a homoplasy in the
phylogeny and (ii) the imbalance between offspring number for each allele (i.e. fitness
differential conferred by the carriage of the derived allele). To do so, we generated 1,000
replicates for each combination of independent emergences (counts) of a homoplasy and
corresponding fitness differential values using results from both masked alignments. For each
replicate, we drew values for the number of descended tips from the actual homoplasic parent
nodes at our 185 candidate mutations sites under putative selection (all 185 pooled). We then
probabilistically assigned a state to each tip according to an offspring imbalance (e.g. 10%). We
drew replicates until we obtained 1,000 for each combination comprising at least two alleles of
each type. The proportion of significant paired t-tests for each combination of independent
homoplasic parent nodes and fitness differential (10% to 80%) is presented as a heatmap
(Figure S12).
The statistical power depends primarily on the number of independent emergences (i.e.
homoplasic parent nodes) rather than the fitness differential (Figure S12, see Discussion).
Beneficial alleles have a far higher chance to increase their allele frequency upon introduction
than deleterious ones, which are expected to be readily weeded out from the population.
Thus, we expect to observe a disproportionally higher number of independent homoplasic
parents nodes for beneficial alleles. As such, the RoHO score index is inherently better suited
to identify mutations associated to increased transmissibility relative to deleterious ones.
