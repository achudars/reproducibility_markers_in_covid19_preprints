Abstract

The spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the ongoing global pandemics has led to
infections of millions of people and losses of many lives. The rapid, accurate and
convenient SARS-CoV-2 virus detection is crucial for controlling and stopping the
pandemics. Diagnosis of patients in the early stage infection are so far limited to viral
nucleic acid or antigen detection in human nasopharyngeal swab or saliva samples.
Here we developed a method for rapid and direct optical measurement of
SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in one step nearly without any sample preparation using
a spike protein specific nanoplasmonic resonance sensor. We demonstrate that we can
detect as few as 30 virus particles in one step within 15 minutes and can quantify the
virus concentration linearly in the range of 103 vp/ml to 106 vp/ml. Measurements
shown on both generic microplate reader and a handheld smartphone connected
device suggest that our low-cost and rapid detection method may be adopted quickly
under both regular clinical environment and resource-limited settings.

Introduction
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the respiratory infections of
SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) virus between
humans1, 2. It is evident that the infection may be effectively reduced and eventually
controlled with swift and large-scale testing for early diagnostics3-6. Current testing
methods include PCR nucleic acid detection with either thermal cycling7,

8

or

isothermal amplification9-11, serological IgM/IgG antibody testing12 as well as viral
protein detections13 in nasopharyngeal swap. The PCR based nucleic acid testing is
very sensitive and accurate in early infection diagnostics but it generally requires
multiple and lengthy processes including virus lysis, RNA extraction, reverse
transcription and amplification and is prone to sample contamination14, 15. Serological
IgM/IgG antibody testing is a very rapid and potentially point-of-care detection
method for epidemiology studies of past viral infections, although not adequate for
early diagnosis, since the serological antibody presence will not occur until a couple
of weeks after the initial viral infection16-18. There were some reported and
commercially available viral antigen S or N protein detection assays however they all
suffered with very poor accuracy, reliability and sensitivity. Therefore it is a global
consensus there is an urgent and tremendous demand for low-cost rapid and reliable
SARS-CoV-2 antigen and virus detection which helps to enable timely and affordable
point-of-care COVID-19 diagnostics for a very large population.
As the matter of fact, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing is a promising
label free and one-step virus detection method and has been used in rapid viral
particle detection such as SARS/MERS19, H1N120, H7N921 .... Once the viral particles
are captured by the monoclonal antibody immobilized on the SPR sensor chip surface,
the plasmon resonance wavelength or intensity change induced by the virus particle
presence can be measured by an optical sensing system22-24. However conventional
SPR testing equipment are bulky and not affordable to most research and clinical
institutions especially in developing countries and resources limited settings25,

26

.

Therefore the SPR viral detection, although often showed in research labs, rarely

becomes a viable method accessible to clinical and point-of-care applications.
Here we report a low-cost nanoplasmonic sensor allowing for one-step rapid
detection and quantification of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (Fig. 1a).

The

low-cost nanoplasmonic sensor chips were made by the method previously reported 27,
28

, and this method allows for large-scale manufacturing with high uniformity and

repeatability (Fig. 1b). Owing to the specially designed periodic nanostructures,
without any external coupling optics, the plasmon resonance wavelength and intensity
change on the virus-capturing sensor can be simply observed by transmission light
spectroscopy or imagin29,

30

. Therefore the nanoplasmonic sensor chips can be

integrated with microwell plate or microfluidic cuvette, and the measurements are
carried out in both ubiquitous generic microplate readers and a low-cost handheld
point-of-care testing device27,

28

. The genetically reconstructed pseudovirus for

SARS-CoV-2, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), MERS (Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome), and VSV (Vesicular Stomatitis Virus) viruses were produced
for testing the device sensitivity and specificity31-33. With proper antibody
functionalization on its surface, the nanoplasmonic sensor is able to detect as few as
30 SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus while showing negligible responses to SARS, MERS
and VSV pseudoviruses. SARS-CoV-2 virus concentrations in the range of 103 vp/mL
to 106 vp/mL can also be quantified by this assay with simultaneous measurements of
diluted standard samples in the same microplate reader. Similar sensing capability are
demonstrated by using a low-cost handheld optical equipment controlled by a
smartphone App. The ultrasensitive SARS-CoV-2 virus detection and potential early
diagnosis of COVID-19 disease become available for point-of-care applications in
clinics, roadside triage sites and even home settings.

Results
Measurement of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus using the generic microplate readers
with homemade 96-well chip plate device.
Fast and sensitive detection of intact coronavirus directly in body fluid samples
are essential to diagnose these viruses and help proper treatment. For this reason, our
chip-in-microwell sensor were developed for the direct multichannel detection of
different concentrations of whole virus particles rather than genetic extraction and
analysis methods, which are accurate, but also time-consuming and low-cost (Fig.
2a,b). The surface of the nanoplasmonic array sensor chip was functionalized with

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies to capture intact coronavirus by binding with spike
proteins on the surface of the coronavirus (Fig. 2c). The initial titer after
centrifugation of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was 3.74 × 1010 vp/mL and it was
quantified via the standard qRT-PCR method. Different dilutions of SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus in PBS solution (from 1.0× 106 to 1.6 × 1010 vp/mL) were added into the
96-well chip plate at the same time. The PBS solution in the absence of SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus was treated as the control group. The real-time dynamic binding curves
of the antigen-antibody interaction was shown in Fig. 3a. It can be seen that the curve
of the control PBS solution group shows almost no change. Interestingly, the relative
OD changes are proportional to these SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus concentrations. The
standard curve of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus detection by the chip-in-microwell
sensor over the range of 1.0× 106 to 1.6 × 1010 vp/mL is shown in Fig. 3b. The relative
OD change value was obtained from the data change over 60 min process as shown in
Fig. 3a. The results were analyzed and fitted using a four-parameter logistic equation,
and the correlation coefficient (R2) is 0.99246. Moreover, the R2 is 0.99994 in the
relatively low virus concentrations range from the 1.0× 106 to 2.5 × 108 vp/mL.
Furthermore, we present a gold nanoparticles (NPs)-enhanced detection
techniques based on our nanoplasmonic resonance sensor device that enables
enhanced-sensitivity, rapid and convenience coronavirus detection in a single-step
sandwich plasmonic resonance immunoassay method (Fig. 3c,d). We implemented the
proposed techniques for detection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus using the specific
binding of SARS-CoV-2 mAbs and Au NP-labeled ACE2 protein to the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,
respectively. We firstly mixed 30 μL of different concentrations of SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus with 10 μL of AuNP labeled ACE2 protein solution, and then dropped the
mixture samples onto the spike protein specific nanoplasmonic resonance sensor for
detection by using a generic microplate reader. The real-time nano-SPR curve of the
interaction is represented in Fig. 3e. There is a clear distinction between different
concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus within 5 min. Rapid quantitative

detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles of a much lower concentration range

（from

1.0× 103 to 6.0 × 105 vp/mL) was achieved via a single-step Au NP-enhanced
nanoplasmonic detection techniques based on our homemade 96-well biosensor chip
plate device. In addition, the 4PL curve fitting R2 between the relative OD change
value and the concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus is 0.97143 over the range
of 1.0× 103 to 6.0 × 105 vp/mL, and the R2 is improved up to 0.99561 in the lower
concentration range from 1.0× 103 to 3.0 × 103 vp/mL (Fig. 2f). The limit of detection
(LOD) of the chip-in-microwell biosensor for the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus detection
was estimated to be 30 virus particles in the final sample solution. Notably, this LOD
is well below the typical viral concentration range in nasopharyngeal swab and saliva3,
34, 35

, suggesting that the chip-in-microwell sensor has the potential to detect

SARS-CoV-2 virus with an ultrahigh sensitivity and effectiveness in early infection
diagnostics, compared to existing technologies requiring laborious sample processing
and amplification.
Reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus requires distinguishing nonspecific
binding of other viruses to the functionalized nanoplasmonic sensor surface. Virus
selectivity is achieved by surface immobilized highly specific antibodies CR3022
showing strong affinity only to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus membrane proteins1,
called spike proteins (Fig. 3c). Here, the detection specificity was evaluated with the
SARS, MERS, and VSV in comparison with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. As shown in
Fig. 3f-h, a significant difference in binding capacity was observed between the
SARS-CoV-2 viruses and other virus strains. These results demonstrate that the
functionalized nanoplasmonic sensor chip has very high specificity (>1000:1) in
detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Measurement of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus using a low-cost handheld optical
equipment controlled by a smartphone App.
Demand for rapid, accurate and convenient SARS-CoV-2 virus detection present
significant challenges in controlling and stopping the pandemics. Diagnosis of
patients in the early stage infection are so far limited to viral nucleic acid or antigen
detection in human nasopharyngeal swabs or saliva samples. Although traditional
approaches, including point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, bedside testing, and
community-based approaches, were applied to address these challenges, innovative
techniques combining with mobile technologies, nanotechnology, imaging systems,
and microfluidic technologies are expected to promote this transformation36-38. In this
work, we also developed a portable and innovative devices controlled by a
smartphone App for real-time measurements of the dynamic binging curves of
SARS-CoV-2 virus on the nanoplasmonic sensor (Fig. 4a). We integrated the
nanoplasmonic sensor chip in a cartridge designed for the handheld testing device,
followed by functional modification of the sensor chip and detection of pseudovirus
particle samples according to the protocol described previously (Fig. 4b). The
functionalized chip cartridge with different concentrations of pseudovirus samples
was inserted into the testing device and the dynamic curves were recorded in real time
through the smartphone APP. The real-time virus binding curve measurement is
presented in Fig. 4c and Video 1. This low-cost handheld sensing platform can
directly detect the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus sample in one step within 15 minutes
and the detectable virus concentrations range over 8.0 × 104 to 6.0 × 106 vp/mL.
Moreover, the detection limit of the handheld equipment is currently about 4000
SARS-CoV-2 virus particles and can be further improved to be comparable with the
microplate reader case.
Furthermore, the detection specificity of the handheld devices for SARS-CoV-2

pseudovirus was also carried out with the SARS, MERS, and VSV pseudovirus. As
shown in Fig. 4d, there was no obvious change in the curves of SARS, MERS, and
VSV pseudovirus. A remarkably rising curve was observed only for the SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus sample, suggesting that the devices controlled by a smartphone App
could offer convenient operability while permit highly sensitive and specific
quantification and detection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. This nanoplasmonic sensor
device with the potential in rapid and affordable early diagnosis of COVID-19 disease
will become available for POC applications in clinics, roadside triage site and even
home settings.

Conslusion
At present the COVID-19 pandemic is still affecting the whole world. However,
there are just a limited rapid diagnostic methods or testing equipments that are
effective for newly infected patients or asymptomatic carriers. In addition, most
detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 viruses have high logistical barriers and thus are
not suitable for POC testing. Therefore in this work, we developed a simple and
low-cost device to rapidly and sensitively detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus in one step
using a nanoplasmonic biosensor integrated with a standard 96-well plate. Our study
confirmed that the nanoplasmonic sensor chip is able to directly detect the whole
SARS-CoV-2 virus with extraordinary time efficiency (<15 min) and sensitivity
(LOD = 30 virus particles). Moreover, similar rapid and sensitive detection
capabilities are demonstrated by using a low-cost handheld optical equipment
controlled by a smartphone App. The detection limit of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in
the final detection system was about 4000 virus particles within 20 min. We therefore
conclude that the low-cost POCT devices would be expected for rapid diagnosis of
SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.

made by a 3D printer (Object 30 primer™ Stratasys Ltd.) .
Surface functionalization. After rinsing the chip integrated microplate wells or cards
twice with deionized (DI) water, the chips were incubated in a 10 mM MUA ethanol
solution for 0.5 h at room temperature. Clean the chips with 70% ethanol and DI
water twice followed by immersion in a mixture of 400 mM EDC and 100 mM NHS
for 30 min to activate the chips at room temperature. Next, the chips were rinsed in DI
water twice and the SARS-CoV-2 mAbs of 12.0 μg/mL (in PBS) were immediately
immobilized to the activated chips for 4 h at room temperature. Rinse the chips with
PBS and DI water, and afterwards incubate the chips in 60 μg/mL BSA blocking
solution and then in 10% ethanolamine solution, and both steps last for 30 min at
room temperature. After incubation, functionalized chips were gently rinsed with DI

°

water twice and then stored in a humid atmosphere at 4 C.
Preparation of gold labeled ACE2 protein. ACE2 Protein prepared in pH 7.0
Glycine-buffered solution (100 nmol/L) was added drop-wise to 1 ml of 30 nm
colloidal Au-NPs solution. The pH of the colloidal Au-NPs solution was adjusted to
pH 7.2 by addition of dilute 0.01 M K2CO3 before adding the ACE2 protein. This was
done in as much as the optimum stability of the conjugates is at pH 7.2, and the least
content of antibody was 0.023 mg/ml of gold solution. The ACE2 protein was initially
incubated with Au-NPs for 30 min. After incubation, 10 μL of Tris-HCl 1× with 1%
BSA blocking solution was added to the gold labeled solution for 10 min. The
Au-NPs suspension was then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 30 min. Centrifugation and
resuspension steps were repeated 3 times. At the final resuspension step, Au-NPs
precipitate were resuspended in 100 μL of Tris-HCl 1× with 0.2% w/v PEG and 0.05%
w/v Tween20. The conjugated Au NPs were stored at 4 °C for further experiments.
Measurement of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus using the homemade 96-well chip
plate device. The dynamic interaction kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus
particles binding to the immobilized SARS-CoV-2 mAbs with respect to time was
performed using the generic microplate reader with our homemade chip-in-microwell
plate. 100 μL of different concentrations of pseudovirus particles (covering the range
of 106 vp/mL to 1010 vp/mL) were added into the functionalized chip-in-microwell
plate at the same time. The dynamic absorption spectrum corves were measured using
a simple small volume microplate reader (Xlement SPR100 ).
The Au NP-enhanced techniques for detection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was
implemented by using the specific binding of SARS-CoV-2 mAbs and Au NP-labeled
ACE2 protein to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the receptor-binding domain
(RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, respectively. We firstly mixed 30 μL of
