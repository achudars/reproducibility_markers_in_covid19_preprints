Abstract

The success of SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) vaccines is measured by their ability to mount
immune memory responses that are long-lasting. To achieve this goal, it is important to
identify surrogates of immune protection, namely, CoV-2 MHC Class I and II
immunodominant pieces/epitopes and methodologies to measure them. Here, we
present results of flow cytometry-based MHC Class I and II QuickSwitchTM platforms for
assessing SARS-CoV-2 peptide binding affinities to various human alleles as well as
the H-2 Kb mouse allele. Multiple SARS-CoV-2 potential MHC binders were screened
and validated by QuickSwitch testing. While several predicted peptides with acceptable
theoretical Kd showed poor MHC occupancies, fourteen MHC class II and a few MHC
class I peptides showed promiscuity in that they bind with multiple MHC molecule types.
With the peptide exchange generated MHC tetramers, scientists can assess CD4+ and
CD8+ immune responses to these different MHC/peptide complexes. Results obtained
with several SARS-CoV-2 MHC class I and II peptides are included and discussed.

Introduction

While various antiviral drugs or passive antibody therapies are attractive approaches as
a bridge to a vaccine, the consensus is that immunization and mounting durable
immune memory against the SARS-CoV-2 is an unavoidable task facing today’s
scientific community [1]. The basic research to uncover the exact mechanisms of how
the SARS-CoV-2 virus is perceived and countered by the human immune system have
been more difficult. In the effort to fight this outbreak, a greater understanding of how
the viral proteins and their processed peptides stimulate the immune responses
mediated by CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes is needed. While some tremendous
research has been undertaken with an impressive swiftness to determine the specific
viral peptides that lead to an effective T cell response, many of the identified SARSCoV-2-reactive T-cells were also found in healthy donors [2,3]. This, in turn, raises even
more questions as to the nature of the viral peptides needed to mount an effective
immune response. In addition, this creates a vital need for a fast and effective way to
generate various MHC tetramers needed to detect the numerous specific T cells that
will be researched while trying to determine the best possible viral peptides that would
stimulate the most effective T cells.

The ability of a peptide to stimulate the immune system stems from such properties as
the availability of the right T cell receptor, antigen processability by the antigen
processing system that could generate the peptide in question, and the peptide’s ability
to occupy the cleft of the MHC molecule [4,5]. It has been observed that more than 80%

of MHC class I-bound peptides derived from a virus can be immunogenic [6]. At least in
the case of viral peptides, peptides that that have a high binding affinity to MHC Class I
molecules tend to also be immunogenic [7,8]. To this end, we have come up with an
antigen presentation platform based on the QuickSwitch peptide exchange principle.
This platform allows users to quantitate the relative ability of MHC molecules to bind a
particular peptide, as well as to generate an MHC tetramer that can be used to stain T
cells in Flow Cytometry experiments. This system relies on an irrelevant and weak
binding peptide, called exiting peptide, which comes pre-loaded into the recombinant
MHC molecule that you wish to study. When the QuickSwitch MHC molecule is
presented with a competing peptide, the exiting peptide will be replaced proportionally
to the MHC binding affinity of the competing peptide. In addition, a FITC-labeled
antibody against the exiting peptide comes included in every kit so that the extent of the
peptide exchange can be measured using a simple Flow Cytometry procedure with
magnetic beads specific for the MHC molecule being tested. In this short study we
would like to report how the QuickSwitch platform (MBL International) can be used to
screen SARS-CoV-2 peptides for their ability to bind various MHC molecules. This short
collection of findings helps avoid unnecessary experiments with SARS-CoV-2 peptides
that cannot be presented by MHC molecules and allows for the construction of working
MHC tetramers that can be used for productive CD8+ and CD4+ cell staining.

Materials and Methods
The peptide binding tests to determine the peptide’s affinity for a specific MHC
haplotype were performed on a 50 µg/mL (MHC concentration) solution of Tetramers for

the MHC Class I molecules or a 100 µg/mL solution of recombinant MHC biotinylated
molecules for MHC Class II. While it is possible to get valid peptide exchange results by
decreasing the Tetramer or monomer concentration even further, it is not
recommended, as some MHC haplotypes are much more sensitive to dilution than
others generating different results depending on the MHC concentration.

MHC Class I peptide exchange procedures. 50 µL of the Tetramer at 50 µg/mL was
mixed with 1 µL of Peptide stock diluted to 1 mM in H2O and 1 µL of the proprietary
Peptide Exchange Factor corresponding to the particular MHC haplotype. HLA-A*02:01,
HLA-A*24:02 and H-2 Kb received 1 µL of Peptide Exchange Factor #1 (PEF#1). HLAA*11:01 received 1 µL of Peptide Exchange Factor #2 (PEF#2). And HLA-A*03:01
received 1 µL of Peptide Exchange Factor #3 (PEF#3). The resulting solution,
containing 50 µg/mL Tetramer, 20 µM peptide to be loaded into the MHC molecule and
1 µL of the Peptide Exchange Factor was incubated in a conical-bottom 96 well PCR
plate for 4 hours at room temperature (≈ 22°C).

Capture assay to determine the binding affinity of a peptide for a particular MHC
haplotype. Following the incubation, the percentage of MHC molecules that were
loaded with the test peptide from the total MHC molecules containing the exiting peptide
was determined by performing a capture assay described in the MBL International
QuickSwitchTM Quant Tetramer Kit Data Sheet. Briefly, 20 µL of magnetic beads linked
with an anti HLA-ABC antibody (provided in the kit) were added into sample wells of a
V-bottom 96-well microtiter plate with 5 µL of the Tetramer peptide exchange solution

(from the 52 µL total volume). The microplate was shaken for 45 minutes at 550 RPM,
protected from light with a sheet of aluminum foil. Following the shaking incubation, all
sample wells were washed with 150 µL of Assay Buffer (provided in the kit, must be
diluted 10x before use), utilizing the magnetic qualities of the beads by letting them
sediment while the plate is immobilized on a magnetic tray. The excess buffer was
decanted out of the plate by flicking while it was being held tight to the magnetic tray.
After rinse each well received 25 µL of Exiting Peptide Antibody-FITC solution (provided
in the kit, must be diluted 25x before use). The microplate containing the magnetic
beads with the bound MHC tetramers and the exiting peptide antibody was shaken
again for 45 minutes at 550 RPM, protected from light with a sheet of aluminum foil. The
samples were washed with another 150 µL volume of Assay Buffer and resuspended in
150 µL of Assay Buffer before the beads read on the flow cytometer.

MHC Class II peptide exchange procedures. For MHC Class II peptide exchange we
followed the parameters of QuickSwitch Quant HLA-DRB1*01:01, HLA-DRB1*04:01
and HLA-DRB1*15:01 assays. 25 µL of a 100 µg/mL biotinylated MHC Class II
QuickSwitch molecule was mixed with 3 µL of Peptide stock diluted to 10 mM in 100%
DMSO and 2 µL of Emulsifier #1 (provided in the kit). The resulting solution, containing
100 µg/mL MHC Class II molecule, 1 mM peptide (or tenfold dilutions) to be loaded into
the MHC Class II molecule and 2 µL of the proprietary Emulsifier #1 was incubated in a
conical-bottom 96 well PCR plate overnight (>10 hours) at 37°C.

The capture assay was performed with nearly identical procedures to the ones used for
the MHC Class I Tetramers. 25 µL of streptavidin conjugated magnetic beads (provided
in the kit) were used to capture 1 µL of the 30 µL MHC Class II peptide exchange
reaction. The MHC molecules were captured by the magnetic beads after shaking the
V-bottom 96-well microtiter plate for 45 minutes at 550 RPM. Following a 150 µL wash
with Peptide Exchange Assay Buffer #2 (provided in the kit, must be diluted 10x before
use) the exchanged MHC Class II molecules were stained with 25 µL of Exiting Peptide
Antibody-FITC (provided in the kit). The antibody was allowed to stain the captured
MHC Class II molecules by shaking the plate for 45 minutes at 550 RPM. The beads
were then washed with another 150 µL of Peptide Exchange Assay Buffer #2 and
resuspended in 150 µL of assay buffer.

Flow Cytometry. The experiments were performed on the CytoFLEX LX (Beckman
Coulter) flow cytometry instrument. The FSC and SSC voltages, gains and thresholds
were adjusted so that the magnetic beads used for the capture assay were detected as
a unique population separate from the background signals. The flow cytometer was
then used to measure the Median Fluorescence Intensity of the FITC signal that
resulted from the Exiting Peptide Antibody binding to the captured MHC tetramers on
the anti HLA-ABC antibody covalently linked beads.

Peptides. All peptides for this experiment were synthesized at the 95% purity level. The
peptides were diluted to 10 mM stocks in 100 % DMSO and stored at -20°C. Further
peptide dilutions before each binding experiment were done with HPLC grade H2O.

In Silico prediction of peptide binding affinities for MHC molecules. All of the
theoretical binding affinities were derived from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB)
web resource funded by NIAID. This website catalogues experimental data on antibody
and T cell epitopes resulting from numerous studies in the context of infectious disease,
allergy, autoimmunity and transplantation. The accumulated data is then compiled and
analyzed to allow the prediction of peptide binding affinities for specific MHC molecules.

Results

The ability of a number of SARS-CoV-2 virus derived peptides as potential binders to
MHC molecules were tested. A few specific SARS-CoV-2 peptides with a high
theoretical binding affinity for the MHC molecules in question, as determined by the
Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) web resource were selected from a large list of MHC
potential binders (supplemental tables 3 and 6). Those peptides were then loaded into
MHC molecules using the parameters of the QuickSwitch kits.

In silico prediction, while an indispensable tool for modern studies on T cell stimulation,
does not always predict the right peptide that would be able to bind to the MHC
molecule’s peptide binding groove, not to mention, stimulate the T cells needed to fight
infection or disease, especially when it comes to MHC Class II molecules [10]. The
following results, obtained with recombinant MHC molecules, can be used in the future
to determine the nature of the T cell immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 without

questioning what viral peptide sequences can be presented by which MHC molecules.
In addition, it will be simplify custom MHC tetramer generation with peptides that have
shown to be good binders.

Using the HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*03:01, HLA-A*24:02, HLA-A*11:01 and H-2 Kb
QuickSwitchTM Quant Tetramer Kits, we were able to identify a number of peptides that
bound to each MHC haplotype (Table 1). The identified SARS-CoV-2 peptides
effectively displaced the exiting peptide which was selected for each individual MHC
haplotype to easily dissociate from the MHC molecule to allow for the binding of even
moderately strong peptides. When more than 75% of the exiting peptide is exchanged
with a target peptide, the resulting tetramer can be used for CD8+ T cell staining. An
exchange rate of higher than 90% corresponds to binding affinities in the low nanomolar
range, while exchange rates lower than 65% are indicative of weak peptide-MHC
interactions (data not shown). In contrast to MHC class II binding peptides there is very
little binding promiscuity among class I alleles with one notable exception: HLA-A3 and
HLA-A11. These 2 alleles are tightly related and all the tested peptides that were highly
exchangeable on HLA-A3 also happened to be good HLA-A11 binders.

To address similar studies in mouse models, we attempted to assess the utility of the
platform in a mouse MHC haplotype. Mouse H-2 Kb specific SARS-CoV-2 peptides
which could be used for T cell immunomonitoring in mouse models of COVID-19 studies
were identified, should they become available. A set of predicted peptides were tested
and determined their peptide occupancies in the groove of H-2 Kb molecules.

Interestingly, two of the identified H-2 Kb peptides were also determined to be good
HLA-A*02:01 binders (Table 2).

The exact exchange ratios of the tested HLA-A*02:01 Tetramer-PE molecules with each
SARS-CoV-2 peptide can be visualized in Figure 1. All HLA-A2 exchange ratios
following a 4-hour incubation can be compared to the exchange ratio of the HLA-A2
Reference Peptide (Figure 1, sample number 29). This peptide has been specifically
selected and engineered to have one of the strongest interactions with the peptide
binding groove of the HLA-A*02:01 molecule. The Reference Peptide is able to
exchange a significant amount of the exiting peptide even when less than 1 µM of it is
used for the exchange reaction.

As an illustration of the effectiveness of in silico prediction algorithms, we compared the
theoretical binding affinity of the studied peptides determined by IEDB and the peptide
exchange ratio resulting from the QuickSwitch assay. While most of the peptides
determined to have low nanomolar Kd values readily exchange with the exiting peptide
of the HLA-A*02:01 molecule, even among the peptides which we have tried there are a
few exceptions. Some peptides with low theoretical Kd values show a low binding ability
to the QuickSwitch HLA-A2 assay and some peptides that should theoretically be bad
binders display a high binding capacity for HLA-A2 (Figure 2). It is those outliers, which
may hold the greatest insight into how the immune system may be skewed to resolve an
infection or pathology and our QuickSwitch platform provides an effective mechanism to
identify those peptides.

We tested 19 SARS-CoV-2 peptides selected with the IEDB web resource for their
ability to bind to recombinant HLA-DRB1*01:01 (DR1), HLA-DRB1*04:01 (DR4) and
HLA-DRB1*15:01 (DR15) molecules. All of the selected peptides were 15 amino acids
in length with various binding affinity to each of the three Class II molecules. Unlike with
the Class I QuickSwitch platform, the Class II peptide exchange cannot be tested
directly on a fluorochrome-conjugated tetramer and the peptide exchange has to be
performed on biotinylated recombinant MHC Class II molecules before they are
tetramerized following the kit’s guidelines. As a Reference Peptide for all of the HLA-DR
molecules tested we used the short sequence of the CLIP87-101 peptide –
PVSKMRMATPLLMQA. While CLIP is generally believed to be a moderate binder of
MHC Class II molecules [11], we have consistently found that its short 15 amino acid
form interacts strongly with recombinant DR1, DR4 and DR15 molecules used to make
MHC tetramers. Most of the tested peptides bound equally well to all three Class II
molecules (Figure 3). Some of the peptide exchanges were repeated with 100 and 10
µM of competing peptide. Peptides RAMPNMLRIMASLVL and SEFSSLPSYAAFATA
exchange equally well at 10 µM and 1 mM indicating that they bind strongly to the three
alleles (Data not shown). In contrast, peptides IWLGFIAGLIAIVMV,
LLLLDRLNQLESKMS and LAFVVFLLVTLAILT did not bind well at the 1 mM level and
showed virtually no exchange at 10 µM. HLA-DR molecules seem to have less
restrictions to peptide binding than the MHC Class I molecules we have tested. Not all
peptides will be equally presented on naturally occurring MHC molecules since some of
them will be selected against the antigen processing and presentation system. To fully

mimic the naturally occurring peptides, some form of an in vitro biochemical antigen
processing model will have to be used to determine which peptides can truly be
presented by the antigen presentations system [12–14] and only then should those
peptides be tested with the QuickSwitch platform.

Discussion

There are concerns that some vaccine researchers focus only on humoral responses to
establish the potency and efficacy of their CoV-2 vaccines. This concern stems from the
fact that the durability and potency of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is indeed partially dictated
by elicited T cell immune responses. Not examining the CoV-2 T cell immunomonitoring
may result in vaccines that induce short lasting humoral responses in the absence of
proper T cell memory responses [15–20]. Other than healthy hosts, it is also important
to analyze CoV-2-specific T cell responses in certain vaccinated sub-populations such
as the elderly, and hosts who bear underlying conditions that are expected to impact the
immune system such as diabetes. To better understand the breath of T cell immune
responses, three essential steps need to be interrogated, i) it is necessary to identify
protein pieces (peptides) that can be processed in antigen processing pathways, ii) to
identify those that are able to interact with the groove of MHC molecules, and iii) to
validate those peptides with human PBMCs to ensure that there are T cell clonotypes
recognizing these peptides in the context of self MHC. This short communication
addresses the second item which is MHC occupancy testing of a selected sets of
peptides that are reported in the past few months based on either in silica prediction

models and/or after validation in PBMCs of hosts. These peptides should be validated in
a system other than the one they are predicted in [21]. The QuickSwitch platform for the
generation of custom tetramers has proven itself to be a robust tool for the identification
of peptides that can form a stable complex with both Class I and Class II MHC
molecules. Unlike in-silico systems, the platform used for this study involves the
quantitation of real peptide binding to recombinant MHC molecules which can then be
used to make tetramers and stain T cells. This allows the users to focus on finding
populations of T cells that react to a specific viral peptide without worrying about
whether this peptide can be presented by the MHC molecules or if the MHC tetramer
that they are using is defective. In addition, the strong-binding peptides that we
discovered in this short study can be used for multiple applications and assays. It is
expected that these findings can be used by other labs to decipher what viral peptides
have the most relevance to fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.

Table 1: Summary of SARS-CoV-2 peptide binding to human MHC class I molecules.
Peptides from different SARS-CoV-2 proteins were selected for strongest binding on the
most frequent human MHC class I alleles: HLA-A2, A3, A11 and A24. All of the
identified peptides were able to exchange at least 75% of the exiting peptide and could
be used to make custom Tetramers for CD8+ T cell staining.

Table 2: Summary of SARS-CoV-2 peptide binding to mouse H-2 Kb MHC molecules.
Peptides from different SARS-CoV-2 proteins were selected for strongest binding on the
H-2 Kb mouse allele. After the peptides were found to exchange at least 75% of the
exiting QuickSwitch peptide they were tested with the HLA-A2 allele and the crossreacting peptides were identified.

Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2 peptide exchange with QuickSwitch HLA-A*02:01 Tetramer-PE
molecules. 50 µg/mL Tetramerized and R-phycoerythrin coupled HLA-A*02:01
molecules were used for the peptide exchange experiment. All HLA-A*02:01 molecules
were loaded with a exiting peptide and incubated with 20 µM of competing SARS-CoV-2
peptides for 4 hours at room temperature (≈ 23°C) in the presence of a kit-determined
volume of Peptide Exchange Factor #1 (PEF#1). The amount of exiting peptide
removed from the MHC molecule was then determined following a capture assay and
plotted on the vertical axis for each tested peptide.

Figure 2: Theoretical binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 peptides to HLA-A*02:01
compared to the practical binding to a Tetramerized recombinant MHC molecule.
Theoretical Kd values of SARS-CoV-2 peptide binding to HLA-A*02:01 molecules as
determined by the IEDB web resource were plotted against the resulting HLA-A*02:01
Tetramer-PE peptide exchange values. The peptides outlined in red circles are
YLYALVYFL (Theoretical Kd = 2.67 nM, Practical Exchange rate = 85%); SVLLFLAFV
(Theoretical Kd = 44.91 nM, Practical Exchange rate = 57.5 %) and ISDEFSSNV
(Theoretical Kd = 908.9 nM, Practical Exchange rate = 93.5%).

Figure 3: SARS-CoV-2 peptide exchange with QuickSwitch HLA-DRB1*01:01, HLADRB1*04:01 and HLA-DRB1*15:01 molecules. 100 µg/mL recombinant HLADRB1*01:01 (Blue Bars), HLA-DRB1*04:01 (Orange Bars) and HLA-DRB1*15:01 (Gray
Bars) molecules were used for the peptide exchange experiment. All MHC Class II
molecules were loaded with an exiting peptide and incubated with 1 mM of competing
SARS-CoV-2 peptides overnight (> 10 hours) at 37°C. The amount of exiting peptide
removed from the MHC molecule was then determined following a capture assay and
plotted on the vertical axis for each tested peptide.
