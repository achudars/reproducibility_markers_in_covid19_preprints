Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and novel coronavirus disease (COVID19) are caused by two closely related beta-coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,
respectively. The envelopes surrounding these viruses are decorated with spike proteins,
whose receptor binding domains (RBDs) initiate invasion by binding to the human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Subtle changes at the interface with ACE2
seem to be responsible for the enhanced affinity for the receptor of the SARS-CoV-2
RBD compared to SARS-CoV RBD. Here, we use Elastic Network Models (ENMs)
to study the response of the viral RBDs and ACE2 upon dissassembly of the complexes. We identify a dominant detachment mode, in which the RBD rotates away
from the surface of ACE2, while the receptor undergoes a conformational transition

which stretches the active-site cleft. Using the Structural Perturbation Method, we determine the network of residues, referred to as the Allostery Wiring Diagram (AWD),
which drives the large-scale motion activated by the detachment of the complex. The
AWD for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are remarkably similar, showing a network that
spans the interface of the complex and reaches the active site of ACE2, thus establishing an allosteric connection between RBD binding and receptor catalytic function.
Informed in part by the AWD, we used Molecular Dynamics simulations to probe the
effect of interfacial mutations in which SARS-CoV-2 residues are replaced by their
SARS-CoV counterparts. We focused on a conserved glycine (G502 in SARS-CoV-2,
G488 in SARS-CoV) because it belongs to a region that initiates the dissociation of the
complex along the dominant detachment mode, and is prominent in the AWD. Molecular Dynamics simulations of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and G502P mutant show that the
affinity for the human receptor of the mutant is drastically diminished. Our results
suggest that in addition to residues that are in direct contact with the interface those
involved in long range allosteric communication are also a determinant of the stability
of the RBD-ACE2 complex.

Introduction
Due to the unprecedented toll that COVID-19 has taken throughout the world, the extraordinary interest elicited by this pandemic from the scientific, medical, and pharmaceutical
communities as well as the general public cannot be overstated. The causative virus in the
COVID-19 disease is a novel beta-coronavirus. The membrane of this virus is decorated
with homotrimeric spike proteins, which are directly responsible for initiating host invasion.
The tip of the spike protein fluctuates between “down” and “up” conformations. 1 In the “up”
state, a receptor binding domain (RBD) is exposed to solution, and is poised to attach to
the host, the first step of viral invasion. Experiments 2,3 have established that the presence
of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is necessary for infecting the hu-

man cell. In addition, structural studies revealed the conformation of the full spike, 1,4 of
the RBD-ACE2 complex, 5–7 and of the receptor-bound spike, 8 thereby setting the stage for
getting near quantitative molecular insights using computational methods. 9,10
Nearly 20 years ago, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) raised worldwide
health concerns. This disease was caused by another beta-coronavirus, SARS-CoV. Similar
to the novel coronavirus (which from now on will be termed SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV
invades the human cell by binding to the ACE2 receptor. 11,12 Structure 4 and sequence 2
of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins are similar (see Fig. 1 for a comparison of
the RBDs), although the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 has higher affinity for ACE2. 4,7,13–15 Binding
assays and careful inspection of the RBD-ACE2 interface inform us of the relevant differences
between the two viruses. 16,17 Deep Mutagenesis Scanning provides the methodology for more
extensive analysis. This technique enables a rapid evaluation of the effect on expression and
binding of replacing selected ACE2 18 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD 15 residues with any other
amino acid. This wealth of information is crucial in order to understand the mechanism
by which RBD recognizes the ACE2. However, it needs to be complemented with detailed
computational models capable of providing a structural rationale to the experimental data.
Binding affinity changes upon mutation could result from perturbation of local interactions (e.g. complementarity of charged, and hydrophobic patches), and long-range effects,
which are often associated with large structural transitions. 19 Such an “action at a distance”
is encoded in the sequence, conformation, and dynamics of the protein or the associated
complex. In the present context, the allosteric “down”

“up” transition of the spike pro-

tein, as well as the binding/dissociation of the RBD and ACE2, likely involve a network
of residues throughout the ensemble, as in other large information-transmitting complexes.
Computational methods have been developed to predict long-range effects associated with
such structural transitions, and provide complementary information to the analysis based
solely on structure and sequence. The Structural Perturbation Method (SPM) 20–22 enables
the determination of the Allostery Wiring Diagram (AWD), which represents a network of

residues that drives large-scale mechanical movement. SPM analysis begins with an Elastic
Network Model (ENM) 23,24 representation of the complex. The ENM is a coarse-grained
description of the system in which all of the components interact via harmonic potentials.
This simplified energy function underlies the fluctuations of the system, which are described
using a combination of normal modes. The AWD determination using the SPM is based on
the premise that key residues associated with conformational transitions between distinct
allosteric states have the largest effect on the few low-frequency, soft modes that describe
the large-scale movement. This can be probed by perturbing the interactions of each residue
and monitoring the response along a mode. The residues that have the largest response to
the perturbation are considered “hot-spots,” and the network of such residues is the AWD.
Here, we used the SPM analysis based on the structures of the complexes between the
RBDs of SARS-CoV 25 and SARS-CoV-2 5,6 with the soluble, metallopeptidase domain (PD)
of the human ACE2 receptor (Fig. 1b). ENM analysis revealed that a single dominant
mode, which is similar in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (see Fig. 2 and Fig. S1), describes
the disruption of the complex. Along this mode, a subset of interfacial interactions focused
around RBD residue G502 (G488 in SARS-CoV) appear to rupture first as the RBD undergoes a counter-clockwise rotation to move away from ACE2 (Fig. 2 and Fig. S1). The SPM
analysis suggests an allosteric connection between the active site of ACE2 and the RBDbinding surface of the receptor (Fig. 3 and Fig. S2). At the interface between ACE2 and
RBD, SPM identifies three distinct regions of interaction, which span the whole interface
(Fig. 4 and Fig. S4). We identified a few residues that could contribute to the change in
the affinity for the receptor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, which prompted us to
perform Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to assess their effect on the stability of the
complex and provide atomically-detailed explanation of our findings. SPM also predicts that
the strongest contribution to the AWD comes from the residues around SARS-CoV-2 G502
and SARS-CoV G488. We surmise that G502 might play a critical role in the dissociation
of the complex, and we tested this hypothesis by performing MD simulations of the G502P

mutant. As predicted by the SPM, the mutation strongly destabilizes the complex. Taken
together, our results show that disassembly of the RBD-ACE2 complex, and hence its stability, is determined by allosteric communication between residues that are spatially distant
from the interface. A clear implication is that long range allosteric transitions must play
a crucial role in driving the “down”

“up” transition in the spike protein, which is the first

step in viral infection.
In the main text, we present results for only SARS-CoV-2 (Figs. 2-4). The Supporting
Information contains the same analysis conducted on SARS-CoV (Figs. S1-S4). In the
Discussion section we examine our findings in the context of few other published studies.

Results
Sequence Comparison: We compared the RBD sequences (see Methods) corresponding to
the experimentally solved structures of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Fig. 1a) used in this
study (for example see also 7,14,27 ). About 81% of the residues are identical or similar (with
a positive score in the replacement matrix, see Methods) between SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2. Focusing on residues involved in interfacial contacts (residues in red in Fig. 1a) only
about 58% are identical or similar. We highlight a few sites which we will describe in detail
in the following. (i) F486 in SARS-CoV-2 replaces L472 in SARS-CoV (red box in Fig. 1b).
These residues are at the interface with ACE2 in a region that is completely reshaped in
SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV. This is due to significant differences in sequence –
the sequence segment from 470 to 485 has only 3 conserved residues with 457-471 of SARSCoV. (ii) Q493 of SARS-CoV-2 substitutes N479 in SARS-CoV in the middle section of
the ACE2-RBD interface (green box in Fig. 1b). (iii) On the backside of the ACE2-RBD
interface, N501 of SARS-CoV-2 has replaced SARS-CoV T487 (blue box in Fig. 1b). (iv)
G502 of SARS-CoV-2 is conserved (G488 in SARS-CoV, see blue box in Fig. 1b).
Dominant Mode: The dynamics of the ACE2-RBD complex can be described by per-

forming a normal mode analysis of the ENM for the complex. Often, long-range, collective
movements are encoded within a small set of low-eigenvalue modes. Therefore, we sought
the modes that provide the best description of the dissociation of the viral RBD and the
receptor. Because the mechanism of complex disruption is unknown, we considered 27 dissociation pathways (see Fig. 1c for a pictorial representation, and for additional details see
the Supporting Information (SI) and Fig. S6). We computed the overlap (the cosine of
the angle between two vectors, see Eq. S18) between each normal mode and all of the displacement vectors representing the disassembly of the complex. We neglected rigid body
movements (colored blue, with negative indices in Fig. 2a and Fig. S1a), which are not associated with the disruption of interactions at the interface. For both SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2a)
and SARS-CoV (Fig. S1a), mode 2 (with the second smallest, non-zero eigenvalue) has the
largest overlap when averaged over the 27 displacement vectors (green arrow in Fig. 2a and
Fig. S1a, see Eq. S19). Mode 2 is also the dominant mode for > 50% of the displacement
vectors considered (insets in Fig. 2a and Fig. S1a, black stars), and it is in the top three
for > 60% of the dissociation pathways (insets of Fig. 2a and Fig. S1a, red bars). Although
other modes could be relevant, we focused only on the dominant one.
Figure 2b shows the movement associated with mode 2: the “jaws” (subdomain I and subdomain II, see Towler et al. 28 ) enclosing ACE2 active site 28 open slightly, and the N-terminal
helix moves right to left (see horizontal red arrow). The RBD rotates away from ACE2 in
a counter-clockwise manner. Figures 2c-d show that the interacting pairs at the interface
in the “front” of the complex (Fig. 2c) get closer, whereas there is domain visible from the
“back” of the ensemble (Fig. 2d) that separates along the dominant mode. Figures S1b-d
show that mode 2 of SARS-CoV RBD-ACE2 complex shares analogous features.
SPM and global AWD: Figures 3-4 show the result of the SPM analysis for SARSCoV-2. The results for SARS-CoV are in Figs. S2-S4. We focus on the “hot spot” residues
that show the largest responses to a local perturbation (Eq. S20). The network of “hot spot”
residues builds the AWD.

The AWD in Figs. 3a,b shows how the response to detachment involves more than merely
the residues at the ACE2 interface. Two pathways connect the interior of ACE2 with the
interface (Fig. 3a): one dominated by polar residues, including Q81 (pink circle in Fig. 3a),
which has amongst the strongest SPM signals (Fig. 3c). The other pathway reaches the
active site of ACE2 PD, with the zinc-binding consensus sequence (374 HExxH378 + E402 , see
Towler et al. 28 ) involved in the network (zinc is shown in orange in Fig. 3a). From the back
(Fig 3b), it is clear that the region associated with the initiation of the detachment (cyan
in Fig. 2d) is dominated by backbone beads and hydrophobic side-chains. In this region,
residues G502 on the RBD and G354 of ACE2 show strong SPM signals (Fig. 3c).
The shape of the overall AWD is similar for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (see Fig. 3a,b
with Fig. S2a,b). A quantitative comparison between the two AWDs shows a robust correlation (Pearson coefficient ≥ 0.8, see Fig. S3), although there are a number of outliers
reflecting the reorganization of the network due to mutations and subtle structural changes.
Many of these outliers occur around the area at the “back” of the complex which initiates
detachment (see Fig. S3). Here, both G502 and V503 in SARS-CoV-2 and the corresponding
SARS-CoV residues (G488 and I489) have among the strongest SPM signals. However, the
contribution of the glycine is larger in SARS-CoV-2 than in SARS-CoV, whereas SARS-CoV
I489 has a much stronger signal than the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 valine.
AWD at the Interface: We draw a number of inferences by examining the three “hot
spot” areas at the interface (Fig. 4). Where possible, the conjectures are tested using MD
simulations.
(A) SPM identified a group of predominantly hydrophobic residues concentrated around
M82 of ACE2 (blue box in Fig. 4a and Fig 4b for SARS-CoV-2, see Fig. S4a,b for SARSCoV). L79 is also part of this hydrophobic patch in the AWD on ACE2 for both SARS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, Y83 contributes to the AWD only for SARS-CoV. In both
viruses, a hydrophobic group interacts with M82 and L79: F486 in SARS-CoV-2 or L472 in
SARS-CoV. Because phenylalanine is larger and more hydrophobic than leucine, it fits better

and the viral RBD in green. The same complex is shown from the “front” (a) and the “back”

The color code distinguishes the alpha-carbons (black), and side-chains which are positively
charged (blue, including histidine), negatively charged (red), polar (pink), and hydrophobic
(grey). The size of the sphere is ∝ 0.5+ωi / max ω, where ωi is the strength of the SPM signal
for bead i, and max ω is the largest SPM signal. Beads selected by SPM and within 0.8 nm
from each other are connected by a yellow line. (a) In the blue, dashed box, we highlight
two sections of the AWD, which connect the bulk of the ACE2 with the interface. On one
side (pink circle), communication is carried out through a cluster of predominantly polar
side-chains, including Q81. On the other (orange circle), it reaches the area surrounding the
zinc-binding consensus sequence, 374 HExxH378 +E402 . (b) The red, dashed box from the back

in the pocket around M82, allowing us to suggest that the former interacts more tightly with
ACE2, despite the reduced SPM signal for F486 compared to L472.
To confirm this hypothesis, we performed MD simulations of each complex separately
and show that L472 slips out of the pocket within a few nanoseconds, whereas F486 remains
inside the pocket (see Fig. 4c). An analysis of the Solvent-accessible Surface Area (SASA)
for F486 and L472 provides the same insight (see Fig. 4d). We also computed the relative
binding strength (∆∆G) between the wild-type (WT) F486 SARS-CoV-2 and the mutant
F486L. In order to do this, we used alchemical methods 29 (see Methods and Supporting
Information) to compute the change in free energy upon mutation of the RBD in isolation or
in complex with ACE2. This can be related to the ∆∆G by constructing the thermodynamic
cycle (see Fig. S8). The resulting ∆∆G (see Table 1) suggests that the mutant has reduced
affinity for ACE2.
(B) In the middle of the ACE2-RBD interface, SPM identified a second cluster around
ACE2 residues K31 and E35 (green box in Fig. 4a and Fig 4e, see Fig. S4a,c for SARS-CoV),
which form the previously identified “hot-spot 31” involving a salt bridge that could stabilize
the complex. 16,17 K31 and E35 interact with Q493 on the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, which is
also a part of the AWD. In contrast, in SARS-CoV the Q493 is replaced by an asparagine
(N479), and SPM displays fewer residues in this region of the AWD (see Fig. S4b).
We tested the difference between asparagine and glutamine by running MD simulations
of the ACE2-RBD WT and Q493N mutant of SARS-CoV-2. Addition of another carbon in
the side-chain allows Q493 to interact with K31 and E35 on the ACE2, whereas the shorter
N493 does not appear to be able to engage in a stable interaction with the same residues on
the ACE2 interface. As a consequence, Fig. 4f shows that N493 of the mutant, but not the
WT Q493, spends a fraction of the time recoiled onto itself. Accordingly, in the ACE2-RBD
complex of SARS-CoV, K31 and E35 move away from the RBD and interact with ACE2
Q76 (see PDBID: 2AJF 25 ).

on ACE2), G502 (RBD) and G354 (ACE2), which carry the largest SPM signals (see Fig. 3c)
and N501 on the RBD. Similar groups are identified in SARS-CoV (Fig. S4d), though the
SPM signal for K353 and D38 is weaker. Interestingly, N501 of SARS-CoV-2 replaces T487
in SARS-CoV. We tested the impact of this replacement by alchemically substituting N501
with a threonine, and we computed the relative binding free energy of ACE2 and RBD
between the WT SARS-CoV-2 and the N501T mutant following the same thermodynamic
cycle as for the F486L mutation (see Fig. S8). We found a negative ∆∆G (see Table 1),
implying that the mutant has a larger affinity for the human receptor, and we compared
unbiased MD simulations of the WT and N501T mutant to determine the reasons of this
change. From Fig. 4h, it appears that the hydroxyl group on the threonine can form a
favorable hydrogen bond with the carbonyl backbone of K353. Given that the asparagine is
slightly longer and only has a hydrogen bond donor at the end of its side-chain, it is unable
to form this connection and is not long enough to successfully interact at the end of the
K353.
At the core of the previously termed “hot-spot 353” is G502, which carries the largest
SPM signal in SARS-CoV-2 and is in the top 3 for SARS-CoV. G502 is the proximal residue
of a short near-alpha-helical turn made by an almost perfectly conserved set of 4 residues:
502

GVGY505 and

488

GIGY491 for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, respectively. This turn on

its own is unlikely to be stable in solution, given the lack of propensity for glycine to be in
a alpha helix. 30 MD simulations (Fig. 5a) confirm this showing that the RBD in solution
is characterized by a larger average distance and broader distribution of the bond between
G502 and Y505.
Importantly, G502 also forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone of K353, which likely
stabilizes the complex. In addition, G502 tightly fits in a small recess on the surface of

ACE2. 15 We mutated glycine 502 to proline, which has a dual effect: (i) it is incapable of
interacting with K353, although it could in principle maintain the helical shape of the tetrad
502

PVGY505 , and (ii) it might introduce steric clashes with ACE2. The result indicates that

proline strongly destabilizes the ACE2-RBD complex (see Table 1). Analysis of the MD
simulations reveals that the distance between the RBD residue in position 502 and K353
increases after the mutation (Fig. 5b), an expected consequence of breaking the hydrogen
bond. Interestingly, this is associated with the strengthening of the ACE2 K353-D38 saltbridge (Fig. 5c). The solvent exposure of the tetrad 502-505 (Fig. 5d) is unaffected by the
mutation in the solvated RBD; on the other hand, residues 502-505 are more solvent exposed
after the G502P mutation in the ACE2-RBD complex. This indicates that the increase in
the volume from glycine to proline reduces the extent to which the tetrad 502-505 fits in the
niche created by ACE2, which underscores the importance of volume-exclusion effects.

Discussion
Overall Movement of the Complex: Along the dominant mode, activated by the detachment, the interfacial contacts break in the vicinity of an area previously denoted as “hot spot
353.” An oscillating movement along the dissociation mode would predict the alternative
weakening of the interaction at the two ends of the ACE2-RBD interface (the hydrophobic
patch and “hot spot 353”), while the central area of the complex maintains its native distance
from ACE2. Such oscillations along mode 2 would be in agreement with MD simulations

of the complex, which show that the two ends of the interface break native contacts more
frequently than the central section. 31
The Importance of G502 (G488 in SARS-CoV): The AWD probes the contribution
of individual residues to the collective response associated with the dissassembly of the RBDACE2. However, the contribution of a residue to the AWD may not be directly correlated
with its effect on the stability of the complex. This is clear from two considerations: first,
a pair of interacting residues that do not move during the disassembly process would not
contribute to the AWD, and yet might have a significant role in regulating the affinity of
the complex – the interaction would remain intact, though it might be strengthened or
weakened by changes in the environment. Second, the AWD only reveals information about
the detachment, and not about the binding of RBD to ACE2. Nevertheless, the information
from the AWD could be combined with other observations to predict the contribution of
a specific group (backbone or side chain) to the stability of the complex. For example, a
combination of factors suggest that modifying the interactions around the RBD G502 (G488
in SARS-CoV) could affect the stability of the complex. (1) SPM indicates that this glycine
belongs to the part of the complex that appears to initiate detachment along the dominant
mode (see Fig. 2d). (2) SPM also suggests that G502 is part of a branch of the AWD
that reaches the bulk of ACE2 (Figs. 3a,b), highlighting that it contributes to a collective
response, which is shown by its strong SPM signal (Fig. 3c). (3) Previous studies argued
the importance of the K353-G502 hydrogen bond. 32,33 (4) Analysis of the structure suggests
that the interaction with G502 might contribute to the stability of the ACE2 salt bridge
between K353 and D38 on the receptor surface (Fig. 4g). This salt bridge could contribute
to the stability of the complex because binding ACE2 to the RBD makes the environment
more hydrophobic, which effectively reduces the dielectric constant making the K353-D38
salt bridge more stable than it would be in solution. 17 Indeed, structures of ACE2 without
RBD show that the salt bridge could be either intact (PDBID: 6M18 5 ) or broken (PDBID:
1R42 28 ). (5) Computational studies indicated that residue G502 is replaced by proline in

a number of coronaviruses which are predicted to interact poorly with the human ACE2
receptor. 34 (6) Deep Mutagenesis Scanning indicated that mutation of G502 in any other
residue hampers the ability of the RBD to bind the human receptor, and this is attributed
to volume exclusion effects. 15
We provided structural characterization to explain these observations by studying the
effect of the substitution of glycine 502 with proline using MD simulations. Free energy
calculations showed that the mutant (G502P) complex is weakened by almost 3 kcal/mol
(Table 1). We could ascribe this effect, at least in part, to the loss of the backbone hydrogen
bond between G502 and K353. However, we also observed that the K353-D38 salt bridge is
stabilized by this substitution. We surmise that the hydrogen bond with the RBD pulls K353
away from D38; in the absence of the interaction with the RBD, the lysine can move closer
to the aspartic acid. While these opposing effects might balance each other, our calculations
of the SASA for the the 502-505 tetrad show that the mutant does not fit well on the ACE2
surface, indicating the important role of steric clashes and shape complementarity. The
importance of volume exclusion is highlighted in Fig. S9, where we plot the data of Starr
et al. 15 for the change in avidity of the mutant G502X as a function of the volume of the
residue X. 35
Mutations at the Interface: We focused our analysis on a few amino acids at the
interface which were replaced in SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV. Our prediction of the
change in binding affinity when F486 is mutated to leucine is in agreement with experiments
measuring the change in binding avidity for the same mutation, 15 and with experiments 16
and simulations 33 showing that the L472F mutation in SARS-CoV resulted in a more stable
complex. Interestingly, the values for the ∆∆G of F486L in SARS-CoV-2 and L472F in
SARS-CoV 33 are in excellent agreement. In addition, computational studies report a ∆∆G
for the F486A mutation that is somewhat larger than our result for the F486L substitution. 36
This is expected: alanine is smaller and less hydrophobic than leucine, resulting in a further
binding penalty when it faces the ACE2 hydrophobic pocket around M82.

We found that the N501T mutation in SARS-CoV-2, which restores the SARS-CoV
residue, increases the binding affinity of the RBD for ACE2. This is in agreement with
expectations 17 but contradicts other computational studies. 34 Experiments have shown that
the N501T reduces the binding strength of the full spike protein, 7 although measurements
probing the result for the RBD alone showed a small increase in avidity upon mutation. 15
Interestingly, the inverse mutation, T487N, in SARS-CoV was also predicted via MD simulations to be favorable, 33 which might highlight that changes to nearby or far-away groups
contribute to selecting which amino acid increases stability.
Our analysis of the difference between glutamine and asparagine in position 493 of SARSCoV-2 indicates that there is a specific recognition of the RBD interface only with glutamine,
which would indicate a small increase in binding affinity. We attempted to compute the
∆∆G associated with this mutation, but preliminary results were deemed to be too small
to be trustworthy. Deep Scanning Mutagenesis indicates that the Q493N mutation reduces
the avidity of the ACE2-RBD complex by a small amount, though it also indicates that
the specific recognition of K31 and E35 might not be crucial, as mutations to hydrophobic
residues (M, A, or Y) further increase the avidity. 15 Also in this case, the Q493N mutation
reduces the binding affinity of the full spike for ACE2. 7 The inverse mutation on SARS-CoV,
N479Q, was predicted to be favorable. 33
Connection with the Active Site: A striking prediction of the SPM is the allosteric
connection between the detachment of the RBD and the active site of ACE2 PD. The opening movement of the “jaws” of ACE2 (subdomain I and subdomain II) is opposite to the
movement observed in the presence of an inhibitor of the catalytic function of the enzyme, 28
which instead triggers the closing of the two subdomains. In addition, the AWD triggered by
the release of the RBD reaches the zinc-binding active site of ACE2. This evidence suggests
a possible connection between enzymatic activity and the formation of the RBD-ACE2 complex. However, the experimental evidence obtained so far yielded mixed results. (i) Mutating
the histidines of the zinc-binding consensus sequence to asparagines impedes catalysis, but

did not prevent ACE2-RBD binding in SARS-CoV. 11 Similarly, (ii) mutations of H374 and
H378 of ACE2 do not significantly enhance or deplete the frequency with which the ACE2
is selected by a cell expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike compared to the wild-type. 18 On the
other hand, (iii) an inhibitor of ACE2 was shown to reduce cell-fusion mediated by SARSCoV. 37 A more direct test of the relationship between RBD binding and ACE2 inhibition is
lacking, to our knowledge. The AWD would predict that a long-range connection between
enzymatic active site and the RBD binding site exists, and although we cannot predict what
the consequences would be, it indicates that further experiments are necessary to probe this
allosteric effect.
Importance of AWD: The presence of the AWD dispersed throughout the complex
suggests that, besides the impact of electrostatic forces, 38 long-range effects caused by the
inherent stiffness of the folded structure 19 may be responsible in not only in the needed
conformational transition that populates the infection competent “up” state, but also affect
the responses at the interface. Although it may be tempting to focus solely on the interactions
at the interface to infer stability of the complexes, residues that are spatially distant also
affect binding interactions, and thus the efficacy of fusion. Thus, both for global mechanical
movements through allosteric communication and for stability, it is critical to determine the
AWD. 21
We focused our analysis on the RBD and the PD of ACE2, but excluded the role of
sugars, which are known to be covalently linked to both ACE2 and RBD. The importance of
glycosylation of the receptor in complex stability has already been investigated experimentally, and using MD simulations. 7,18,31,39 Future developments will expand the model of the
viral protein including the rest of the spike, and of ACE2 (though the structure of the collectrin homology domain might not be stable in solution, as evidenced by the weak electron
density map reported by Towler et al., 28 and therefore models that account for the cellular
membrane might be required). The current study provides a sound computational framework to investigate the AWD activated transitions upon dissolution of the complex. Our

study also suggests that allosteric communication across the entire spike may be involved in
the initial stages of fusion.

Materials and Methods
Sequence Alignment: In order to compare the structures of the ACE2-RBD complexes
(Fig. 1b), we aligned the sequences using dynamic programming. 40 We adopted the BLOSUM50 scoring matrix, with penalties −12 and −2 for opening and continuing gaps, respectively. 40 Aligned residues are considered similar if they have a positive BLOSUM50 score.
ENM and SPM: The steps in the AWD determination are the following. First, we
computed the modes and frequencies of the bound complexes (Fig. 1b), considering only
protein components – RBD [333-527 for SARS-CoV-2 (PDBID: 6LZG), 323-502 for SARSCoV (PDBID: 2AJF)] and ACE2 [19-614 for the complex with SARS-CoV-2 (PDBID: 6LZG),
19-615 for the complex with SARS-CoV) (PDBID: 2AJF)], ignoring ions (zinc and chloride,
which is found in structure PDBID: 2AJF, but not in PDBID: 6LZG), water, and sugars.
Second, we validated the model by comparing the scaled and normalized B-factors with
experiments (see the Supporting Information and Fig. S5). The location and height of many
peaks was reproduced correctly without adjusting any parameters. Third, we constructed
an ensemble of dissociated structures (Fig. 1c, see details in the Supporting Information and
Fig. S6) in which the ACE2 structure is intact, and the RBD is rigidly displaced away from
the ACE2. Fourth, we identified the mode that provides the most accurate description of the
rigid-body displacement of the RBD (one with the largest “overlap” defined in the Supporting
Information, Eqs. S18-S19), and analyzed the mode-induced conformational changes in the
ACE2 and RBD (Fig. 2 and Fig. S1). Finally, by performing the SPM analysis, we determine
the critical residues throughout the complex (Fig. 3 and Fig. S2), and at the interface (Fig. 4
and Fig. S4). The SPM signal (ω, defined in Eq. S20) is a result of the response to a
perturbation of the interactions of one group with the rest of the protein along a selected

mode. The network of residues with the largest responses to a local perturbation (that is,
ωi > 2ω̄, where ω̄ is the average SPM signal (see Eq. S25) constitute the AWD. Additional
details of the ENM and SPM are in the Supporting Information.
MD Simulations: We used alchemical substitutions 29 in order to estimate the difference
in binding free energy of the RBD-ACE2 complex upon mutation of a few RBD residues.
The free energy change upon mutating a residue in the bound and dissociated complex can
be computed numerically, and the scheme in Fig. S8 shows that it is related to the change
in binding free energy (∆∆G) between the wild type and mutant. ∆∆G > 0 refers to
a mutation that decreases the stability of the complex, while ∆∆G < 0 implies that the
mutation stabilizes the ACE2-RBD complex.
The details of the MD simulations are discussed in the Supporting Information. Briefly,
we performed the explicit-solvent simulations with NAMD 41 with CHARMM36 42 force field
for proteins and TIP3P 43 for water. The VMD 44 package Mutator was used to setup the
alchemical substitutions for computing the ∆G of mutation. The transformation of the
WT protein into a mutant was carried out via a series of intermediate steps for both the
RBD alone in solution, and the solvated RBD-ACE2 complex. The free energy difference
was computed using Bennett Acceptance Ratio 45 at each intermediate step. Results were
repeated 3 times from different initial structures in order to estimate the error.
Visualization: Molecular structures were rendered with PyMol 26 or VMD. 44 Matplotlib 46 and Jupyter notebooks 47 were also used to plot and analyze the data.
