Abstract
Starting from December 2019, a novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, was found
to cause Severe Acute Respiratory (SARI) symptoms and rapid pandemic in China.
With the hope to identify candidate drugs for 2019-nCoV, we adopted a computational
approach to screen for available commercial medicines which may function as
inhibitors for the Mpro of 2019-nCoV. Up to 10 commercial medicines that may form
hydrogen bounds to key residues within the binding pocket of 2019-nCoV Mpro were
identified, which may have higher mutation tolerance than lopinavir/ritonavir and may
also function as inhibitors for other coronaviruses with similar M pro binding sites and
pocket structures.

Introduction
Coronaviruses,

members

of

the

family

Coronaviridae

and

subfamily

Coronavirinae, are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses which have spikes of
glycoproteins projecting from their viral envelopes, thus exhibit a corona or halo-like
appearance (Masters and Perlman, 2013; Cui et al., 2019) Coronaviruses are the causal
pathogens for a wide spectrum of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in both wild
and domestic animals, including birds, pigs, rodents, etc (Dhama et al., 2014). Previous
studies have found that six strains of coronaviruses are capable to infect human,

including four strains circulating yearly to cause common cold, and other two strains
which the source for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), respectively (Cui et al., 2019; Dhama et al., 2014).
Starting from December 2019, a novel coronavirus, which was later named 2019nCoV (‘n’ stands for novel), was found to cause Severe Acute Respiratory (SARI)
symptoms, including fever, dyspnea, asthenia and pneumonia among people in Wuhan,
China (Zhu et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Hui et al., 2020). The first batch of patients
infected by 2019-nCoV were almost all connected to a seafood market in Wuhan, which
also trades wild animals. Later, contact transmission of 2019-nCoV among humans was
confirmed, and the number of infected patients increased rapidly in Wuhan as well as
other major cities in China. A series of actions have taken by the Chinese government
to control the pandemic of the virus, and effective medical methods are in urgent needs
to prevent 2019-nCoV infection and cure the disease.
Among all know RNA viruses, coronaviruses have the largest genomes ranging
from 26 to 32 kb in length (Regenmortel et al., 2000; Schoeman and Fielding, 2019).
Besides encoding structural proteins, majority part of the coronavirus genome is
transcribed and translated into a polypeptide, which encodes proteins essential for viral
replication and gene expression (Lai and Holmes, 2001). The ~306 aa long main
protease (Mpro), a key enzyme for coronavirus replication, is also encoded by the
polypeptide and responsible for processing the polypeptide into functional proteins (Lai
and Holmes, 2001). The Mpro has similar cleavage-site specificity to that of picornavirus
3C protease (3Cpro), thus is also known as 3C-like protease (3CLpro) (Gorbalenya et al.,
1989). Studies have shown that Mpros of difference coronaviruses are highly conserved
in terms of both sequences and 3D structures (Xue et al., 2008). These features, together
with its functional importance, have made Mpro an attractive target for the design of
anticoronaviral drugs (Xue et al., 2008; Anand et al., 2003).
To present, these are still no clinically approved antibodies or drugs specific for
coronaviruses, which makes it more difficult for curing 2019-nCoV caused diseases

and controlling the associated pandemic. With the hope to identify candidate drugs for
2019-nCoV, we adopted a computational approach to screen for available commercial
medicines which may function as inhibitors for the Mpro of 2019-nCoV.

Results
A previous attempt to predict drugs for the Mpro of SARS-CoV has identified two
HIV-1 protease inhibitors, namely lopinavir and ritonavir, as potential candidates, both
of which bind to the same target site of Mpro (Nukoolkarn et al., 2008). Clinical
application of these two drugs on 2019-nCoV patients also appears to be effective,
demonstrating the importance of the drug binding site for suppressing 2019-nCoV Mpro
activity.
To search for other drugs that may inhibit 2019-nCoV Mpro, we first evaluated the
sequence and structural conservation of lopinavir/ritonavir bind site between SARSCoV and 2019-nCoV. The protein sequences of SARS-CoV Mpro and 2019-nCoV Mpro
are 96% identical (Figure 1a), and the spatial structure of the previously reported
lopinavir/ritonavir bind pocket is also conserved between SARS-CoV Mpro and 2019nCoV Mpro (Figure 1b). The conserved amino acids Thr24-Asn28 and Asn119
(numbered according to positions in SARS-CoV Mpro as the present sequence of 2019nCoV Mpro in GenBank is in polypeptide form) formed the binding pockets for
lopinavir/ritonavir in the spatial structure of both SARS-CoV Mpro and 2019-nCoV Mpro,
whereas the nearby non-conserved amino acids locate far away from the binding pocket,
thus would not affect its structural conservation (Figure 1b). Virtual docking of
lopinavir/ritonavir to 2019-nCoV Mpro also showed high binding ability to the pocket
site (Figure 1c), similar to previous report for SARS-CoV Mpro (Nukoolkarn et al.,
2008). Amino acids Thr24, Thr26, and Asn119 were predicted to be the key residues
for binding the drugs (Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure 1), forming 2 hydrogen
bonds with lopinavir and 2 hydrogen bonds with ritonavir, respectively.

shown as orange lines.
Basing on these results, we performed virtual docking to screen for commercial
medicines in the DrugBank database that could bind to the above mentioned pocket site
of 2019-nCoV Mpro, and identified 10 candidate clinical medicines (Table 1, Figure 1d
and Supplementary Figure 2). These drugs could form hydrogen bonds with one or
more residues among Thr24-Asn28 and Asn119, theoretically, are capable to bind to

the pocket formed by these amino acids and interfere the function of 2019-nCoV Mpro.
In summary, basing on the structural information of clinical effective medicines for
2019-nCoV, we have predicted a list of commercial medicines which may function as
inhibitors for 2019-nCoV by targeting its main protease Mpro. Compared to
lopinavir/ritonavir, most of these predicted drugs could form more hydrogen bounds
with 2019-nCoV Mpro, thus may have higher mutation tolerance than lopinavir/ritonavir.
The binding pockets of these drugs on Mpro are conserved between SARS-CoV Mpro
and 2019-nCoV Mpro, indicating the potential of these drugs to function as inhibitors
for other coronaviruses with similar Mpro binding sites and pocket structures.

Methods
Sequence Resource
The protein sequences of SARS-CoV Mpro (Accession: 1UK3_A) and 2019-nCoV
polyprotein orf1ab (Accession: YP_009724389.1) were downloaded from GenBank
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The protein sequence of 2019-nCoV Mpro was
determined by aligning the SARS-CoV Mpro sequence to 2019-nCoV polyprotein
orf1ab using BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990), the best aligned region in 2019-nCoV
orf1ab to SARS-CoV Mpro was selected as 2019-nCoV Mpro.

Structure Modeling
Crystal structure of SARS-CoV Mpro (PDB ID: 1UJ1) was downloaded from Protein
Data Bank (PDB, http://www.rcsb.org) (Burley et al., 2019). Structure of 2019-nCoV
Mpro was predicted by Modeller algorithm (Webb and Sali, 2016) using the structure of
SARS-CoV Mpro as template. Structural details were visualized with the Visualizer
function of Discovery Studio 3.5 (Accelrys Software Inc).

Candidate Drug Screen
Molecular structures of commercial available medicines were downloaded from the
DrugBank database (http://www.drugbank.ca) (Wishart et al., 2018). The original
indications of medicines were collected according to DrugBank descriptions. Virtual
screening of medicines with binding potential to the pocket site of 2019-nCoV Mpro was
performed using the Libdock algorithm of Discovery Studio 3.5 (Accelrys Software
Inc). The pocket site of 2019-nCoV Mpro was identified by homology comparison to a
previous published work (Nukoolkarn et al., 2008). Spatial conformations of medicines
were generated using CAESAR algorithm of Discovery Studio 3.5 using default
parameters. Maximal hits of the docking process was set to 50.
