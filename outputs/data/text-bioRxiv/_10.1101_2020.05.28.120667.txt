Abstract: Due to the current pandemic, global shortage of reagents has drawn interest in

6

developing alternatives to increase the number coronavirus tests. One such alternative is sample

7

pooling. Here we compared commercial kits that are used in COVID-19 diagnostics, in terms of

8

sensitivity and feasibility for use in pooling. We showed that pooling of up to 60 samples did not

9

affect the efficiency of the kits. Also, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a more

10

suitable target in pooled samples than the Envelope (E) protein. This approach could provide an

11

easy method of screening large number of samples and help adjust different government

12

regulations.

Introduction

33
34

The recent emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

35

(SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 from Wuhan, China, has caused more than 5 million cases

36

with an estimate of more than 300 000 deaths associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

37

(1). Clinical manifestation of COVID-19 infection is variable ranging from asymptomatic to

38

severe disease, with symptoms including respiratory distress, fever, cough, dyspnea, and viral

39

pneumonia (2). Since there is currently no targeted therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and

40

clinical manifestations are not disease specific, diagnostic screening and implementation of strict

41

biosecurity measures issued by governments are limiting the spread of the disease (3). The most

42

widely used molecular method approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers

43

for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to detect SARS-CoV-2 is the real-time reverse

44

transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (4). In the case of a public health

45

emergency, most of diagnostic laboratories worldwide can rely on this technology to routinely

46

perform diagnostic services until standardized tests are widely available. Different PCR assays

47

were rapidly developed to target the ORF1a/b, ORF1b-nsp14, RdRp, S, E, or N gene of SARS-

48

CoV-2 and other related betacoronaviruses, such as the closely related SARS-CoV (3, 5). The

49

majority of qPCR tests are using different sample matrixes, represented by either swabs or

50

sputum, since they contain relatively high titer virus, due to the initial viral replication in the

51

upper respiratory tract (6). However, the global need for a new surveillance approach reflects the

52

requirement to adapt to the increased demand of number of molecular tests to adjust the

53

lockdown policies.

54

Diagnostic pooling has been already shown to be effective both in veterinary medicine,

55

detecting various diseases induced by swine influenza, African swine fever virus or foot-and-

56

mouth disease virus (7; 8; 9) and in human medicine for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

57

and other transfusion-transmittable diseases (10; 11). Recently, the same approach showed

58

encouraging results for SARS-CoV-2 when a pool of up to 7 samples was used before the

59

extraction and up to 60 samples could be pooled after (12).

60

Therefore, our main goal was to evaluate and compare some commercial kits currently

61

used for COVID-19 diagnostics, using the sample pooling approach. We also showed that the

63

Sample collection and processing

67

Samples included in this study consisted of swabs collected from both nostrils and the

68

throat or sputum, following the WHO recommendations by healthcare providers and sent to the

69

Molecular laboratory VetWork Diagnostics, Tulcea, Romania and Personal Genetics, Bucharest,

70

Romania. A volume of 200 ul of the transport swab buffer was mixed with 500 ul lysis buffer and

71

RNA was extracted using Power Prep Viral DNA/RNA Extraction kit, (Kogene Biotech, Seoul,

72

Republic of Korea). Sputum samples were mixed with equal volume of PBS and processed as

73

described above. We obtained samples tested between April 20-27, 2020. Samples collected from

74

24 confirmed COVID-19 patients were extracted, aliquoted and stored at –80°C until use. Negative

75

samples were collected from 60 healthy volunteers with no COVID-19 associated symptoms.

76
77

RNA extraction

78

Extraction of RNA was performed with Power Prep Viral DNA/RNA Extraction Kit

79

(Kogene biotech, Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. After lysis, samples

80

were incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes, after incubation 700 µl of binding buffer was

81

added, followed by vortex and spin. Supernatant was passed through the Binding Column. The

82

columns were washed two times with 500 µl Wash Buffer A first and Wash Buffer B second. At

83

the final 50 µl of Elution Buffer was added and incubated for 1 minute at room temperature,

84

followed by a spin at 13.000 rpm for one minute and eluted RNA collected.

Ethical considerations
The study was conducted as part of surveillance program for COVID-19 implemented by

125

the Romanian government, with no disclosure regarding name, physical, economic, cultural,

126

social status of the patients, therefore did not require individual patient consent or ethical

127

approval.

Results
1. Evaluation of commercial SARS-CoV-2 qPCR kits
To determine the analytical sensitivity of the COVID-19 commercial assays used in

132

Romanian hospitals (PowerCheck Kogene 2019-nCoV, COVID -19 PCR Diatheva Detection Kit

133

and 2019-nCoV CDC EUA), we first evaluated their limit of detection (LOD) using the positive

134

controls provided by the kit. Assay reproducibility was tested in duplicate using 10-fold serial

135

dilutions of the controls and intra- and inter-assay variability evaluated for each dilution point in

136

triplicate on two different PCR machines. The LOD of RdRp and E (end point at 10−7 fold

137

dilution) was similar between the assays from Kogene and Diatheva. However, for the CDC

138

EUA kit, LOD for N1 and N2 was 2 log unit lower (10−4 fold dilution) than that of E and RdRp.

139

Therefore, for the future experiments, we decided to use Kogene and Diatheva kits.

140

2. Evaluation of different clinical specimens collected from COVID-19 infected patients

141

Samples were collected from patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, ranging

142

from 22 to 80 years old and consisted of swabs (from throat and/or nostrils) or sputum. Clinical

143

presentation was either asymptomatic or mild in 14/24 patients; the rest of 10 patients either with

144

moderate or severe COVID-19 outcome associated with co-morbidities (Table 2). Seven patients

145

were tested negative by PCR for the initial screening, but were positive when the PCR was

146

repeated after 2 weeks interval. Mild or asymptomatic patients did not have any other co-

147

morbidities, and clinical signs were limited to either fever, cough and/or shortness of breath, as

148

shown in Table 2. PCR results revealed an average Ct value for E gene of 25.78±1.16 and for

149

RdRp, 26.05±1.18, with no variation between sample matrix used (either nasal/throat swabs or

150

sputum).

152
153

3. Sample pooling and comparative performance of targets
In order to test the pooling approach, we decided to use a sample with an average Ct

154

value of 26.25±2.1 to spike into seven negative pools containing equal volumes (200 ul/sample)

155

of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 and 60. No optimization is required if using same volumes. Pools were

156

then processed and extracted as previously described. Each reaction contained the undiluted

157

sample used for pooling to assess for sample degradation of variation between assays. Finally,

158

5ul of the extracted RNA was added to the RT-qPCR reagent mix from Kogene or Dyatheva. We

159

repeated the experiment two times and all the pooled samples were ran in triplicate (Figures 1

160

and 2). As shown in Figure 1, all the pools were positive for RdRp gene, which is consistent with

161

other reports selecting molecular targets for COVID-19 diagnostics (13). As the sample pool

162

increased signal for E gene was lost after pooling 20 negative samples. However, Diatheva kit

163

managed to detect both targets in the pool of 30 samples (Figure 2).

164
165
166

Discussion
As some countries are lifting up lockdown measures implemented through February and

167

March, economies have to open quickly and safely. The initial steps to resume economical

168

activities have to prioritize public health (14). Therefore massive scaling up COVID-19 testing is

169

the temporary solution until immunity levels are achieved. One of the approaches that can be

170

easily applied in order to increase the number of tests represents sample pooling. We showed that

171

using a range of negative sample matrixes with one representative sample, ranging from 5 to 60

172

pools only leads to only an incremental increase in the Ct values, for the RdRp target. This is

173

consistent with the initial report for SARS-CoV-2 pooling, however the number of samples used

174

for pooling before RNA extraction, was limited to 7 (12). This approach would be feasible for

175

laboratories that are performing large-volume testing and considering screening with the

176

commercial kits evaluated in this study. Moreover, laboratories may consider testing as many as

177

60 samples using different sample matrixes, using the standard protocols, as an option for cost

178

savings without compromising the capacity to detect SARS-CoV-2. However, there are several

179

limitations that might arise using the pooled sample approach.

180

One limitation of this approach is that it seems only the RdRp gene is suitable for

181

detection of SARS-CoV-2 in pools larger than 30 samples, which might arise in false negative

182

results due to equipment variation and sample handling. However, this could be easily

183

circumvented by integrating additional SARS-CoV-2 specific targets. Moreover, the complexity

184

of the disease can influence the sensitivity and specificity of the assay (15). Our results are

185

showing that RdRp would be the ideal target for sample pooling, rather than E gene. This agrees

186

with the initial development of molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection, when RdRp gene

187

assays 3.6 copies per reaction for the RdRp assay (4; 13).

188
189

In this research, we showed that sample pooling for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic is a feasible
measure using commercial kits widely available.
