SUMMARY
Covid-19 morbidity and mortality are associated with a dysregulated immune response.
Tools are needed to enhance existing immune profiling capabilities in affected patients. Here
we aimed to develop an approach to support the design of focused blood transcriptome
panels for profiling the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We designed a pool of
candidates based on a pre-existing and well-characterized repertoire of blood transcriptional
modules. Available Covid-19 blood transcriptome data was also used to guide this process.
Further selection steps relied on expert curation. Additionally, we developed several custom
web applications to support the evaluation of candidates. As a proof of principle, we
designed three targeted blood transcript panels, each with a different translational
connotation:

and

immunological relevance. Altogether the work presented here may contribute to the future
expansion of immune profiling capabilities via targeted profiling of blood transcript
abundance in Covid-19 patients.

INTRODUCTION
Covid-19 is an infectious, respiratory disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus:
SARS-CoV-2. The severity of symptoms and the course of infection vary widely, with most
patients presenting mild symptoms. However, about 20% of patients develop severe disease
and require hospitalization (1,2). The interaction between innate and adaptive immunity can
lead to the development of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens that might
be associated with viral clearance and protection (3). But immune factors are also believed
to play an important role in the rapid clinical deterioration observed in some Covid-19
patients (4). There is thus a need to develop new modalities that can improve the delineation
of “immune trajectories” during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Blood transcriptome profiling involves measuring the abundance of circulating
leukocyte RNA on a genome-wide scale (5). Processing of the samples and the raw
sequencing data however, is time consuming and requires access to sophisticated
laboratory and computational infrastructure. Thus, the possibility of implementing this
approach on large scales to ensure immediate translational potential is limited. Such
unbiased omics profiling data might rather be leveraged to inform the development of more
practical, scalable and targeted transcriptional profiling assays. These assays could in turn
serve to significantly bolster existing immune profiling capacity.
Fixed sets of transcripts grouped based on co-expression observed in large
collections of reference datasets provide a robust platform for transcriptional profiling data
analyses (6). Here we leveraged a repertoire of 382 transcriptional modules previously
developed by our team (7). The repertoire is based on a collection of reference patient
cohorts encompassing 16 pathological or physiological states and 985 individual
transcriptome profiles. In this proof of principle study, we used the available transcript
profiling data from two separate studies to select Covid-19 relevant sets of modules (8,9).
Next, we applied filters based on pre-specified selection criteria (e.g. immunologic relevance
or therapeutic relevance). Finally, expert curation was used as the last selection step. For
this we have developed custom web applications to consolidate the information necessary

for the evaluation of candidates. One of these applications provides access to module-level
transcript abundance profiles for available Covid-19 blood transcriptome profiling datasets.
Another web interface was implemented which serves as a scaffold for the juxtaposition of
such transcriptional profiling data with extensive functional annotations.

RESULTS
Mapping Covid-19 blood transcriptome signatures against a pre-existing reference set
of transcriptional modules
SARS-CoV-2 infection might not result in changes in transcript abundance across all of the
382 transcriptional modules constituting our repertoire [(encompassing 14,168 transcripts)
see methods section and (7)]. Indeed, the 16 reference patient cohorts upon which our
repertoire was based encompass a wide range of immune states, including infectious
diseases but also autoimmune diseases, pregnancy and cancer. Thus, the first step involved
identifying subsets of modules for which changes could be observed in Covid-19 patients.
We used two sets of Covid-19 patients for this proof of principle analysis. These
datasets were contributed by Xiong et al. (9) (one control and three subjects) and Ong et al.
(8) (nine controls and three subjects profiled at multiple time points). Their data were
generated using RNA-seq and Nanostring technology, respectively. The generic 594
transcript panel used by Ong et al. did not give sufficient coverage across the 382-module
set. We thus mapped the transcript changes at a lower resolution, using a framework formed
by 38 module “aggregates“. These 38 aggregates were constituted by grouping modules
based on similarities in abundance patterns across the 16 reference datasets [see methods
section and (7)].
We first assessed changes in transcript abundance resulting from SARS-CoV-2
infection across the 38 module aggregates (Figure 1). In general, we saw a decrease in
aggregates associated with lymphocytic compartments (aggregates A1 & A5) and an
increase in aggregates associated with myeloid compartments and inflammation
(aggregates A33 & A35). As expected, we also saw increases over uninfected controls for

the module aggregate associated with interferon (IFN) responses (A28) and the module
aggregate presumably associated with the effector humoral response (A27). We detected a
wide spread of values for aggregate A11 for the Nanostring (Ong et al.) dataset. However,
this aggregate comprises only one module, with only two of its transcripts measured in this
Nanostring code set (the probe coverage across all aggregates is shown in Supplementary
Figure 1).
Despite large differences between the two studies in terms of design, range of
clinical severity, technology platforms and module coverage, the combined overall changes
(detected at a high-level perspective) are consistent with those observed in known acute
infections, such as those caused by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or S. aureus.
This consistency is evidenced by the indicated by patterns of change observed for the
reference fingerprints shown alongside those of Covid-19 patients (Figure 1).
Overall, such a high-level analysis allows us to identify module aggregates forming
our repertoire that may be included in further selection steps. In this proof of principle
analysis, we selected 17 aggregates for further analysis (Table 1).

Identification of coherent sets of Covid-19-relevant modules
The abundance patterns for modules comprised in a given aggregate are not always
homogeneous (Figure 2). Thus, a next step would consist of identifying sets of modules
within an aggregate that display coherent abundance patterns across modules forming a
given aggregate.
To achieve this, we first mapped the changes in transcript abundance associated
with Covid-19 disease using the RNAseq dataset from Xiong et al., as illustrated for A31
(Figure 2A) and A28 (Figure 3A). Similar plots can be generated for all other aggregates
using the “COVID-19” web application (also compiled in Supplementary File 1 and listed in
Table 2). Next, we identified and assigned a module set ID for each aggregate the modules
that formed homogeneous clusters. For example, we designated the first A28 set as A28/S1.
Such module grouping is only based on patterns of transcript abundance observed in three

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.107243; this version posted May 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

Covid-19 patients; however, the groupings were often consistent with those observed for the
much larger reference cohorts that constitute the module repertoire (Figure 2B and Figure
3B). A28/S1, which is formed by M8.3 and M15.127, serves as a good example of this
consistency (Figure 3B). Likewise, the segregation of the modules forming A31 based on
differences observed in the three Covid-19 patients was also apparent in the reference
patient cohorts (Figure 2B). Specifically, an increase in A31/S1 modules, which
accompanied a decrease in A31/S2 modules, in these three patients was also characteristic
of RSV patients.
We ultimately derived 28 homogeneous Covid-19 relevant module sets from the 17
aggregates selected in the earlier step (Table 1). These sets might be used as a basis for
further selection.

Design of an illustrative targeted panel emphasizing immunological relevance
In the previous step, we used available Covid-19 data to guide the selection of 28 distinct
“Covid-19 relevant module sets”. In the next step, we selected the transcripts within each
module set that warranted inclusion in one of three illustrative Covid-19 targeted panels. A
first panel was formed using immunologic relevance as the primary criterion, a second was
formed on the basis of relevance to coronavirus biology, a third was constituted on the basis
of relevance to therapy.
For the first panel we matched transcripts comprised in each module set to a list of
canonical immune genes (see methods for details). Expert curation also involved accessing
transcript profiling data from the reference datasets, indicating for instance leukocyte
restriction or patterns of response to a wide range of immune stimuli in vitro. We describe
our approach for module and gene annotation in more detail below and provide access to
our resources to support expert curation (Table 2).
For our illustrative case, we selected one representative transcript per module set to
produce a panel comprised of 28 representative transcripts (Table 3). Examples of
signatures surveyed by such a panel include: 1) ISG15 in A28/S1 (interferon responses),

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.107243; this version posted May 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

which encodes for a member of the ubiquitin family. ISG15 plays a central role in the host
defense to viral infections (10). 2) GATA1 in A37/S1 (erythroid cells), which encodes for a
master regulator of erythropoiesis (11). It is associated with a module signature (A37) that
we recently reported as being associated with immunosuppressive states, such as late stage
cancer and maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in solid organ transplant recipients
(12). In the same report we also found an association between this signature and
heightened severity in patients with RSV infection and established a putative link with a
population of immunosuppressive circulating erythroid cells (13). 3) CD38 in A27/S1 (cell
cycle), which encodes for the CD38 molecule expressed on different circulating leukocyte
populations. In whole blood we find the abundance of its transcript to correlates with that of
IGJ, TNFRSF17 (BCMA), TXNDC5 (M12.15). Such a signature was previously found to be
increased in response to vaccination at day 7 post administration, to correlate with the
prevalence of antibody producing cells, and the development of antibody titers at day 28
(14). 4) TLR8 in A35/S1 (inflammation), encodes toll-like receptor 8. Expression of
transcripts comprising this aggregate is generally restricted to neutrophils and robustly
increased during sepsis (e.g. as we have described in detail earlier for ACSL1, another
transcript belonging to this aggregate (15)). 5) GZMB in A2/S1 (Cytotoxic cells) encodes
Granzyme B, a serine protease known to play a role in immune-mediated cytotoxicity. Other
transcripts forming this panel are listed in Table 3.
Even with the limited amount of data available to guide the selection in the previous
steps, it is reasonable to assume that such a panel (while not optimal) would already provide
valid information for Covid-19 immune profiling. Additional Covid-19 blood transcriptome
data that will become available in the coming weeks will allow us to refine the overall
selection process.

Design of an illustrative targeted panel emphasizing therapeutic relevance
A different translational connotation was given for this second panel. Here, we based
the selection on the same collection of 28 module sets. However, this time, whenever

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.107243; this version posted May 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

possible, we included transcripts that could have value as targets for the treatment of Covid19 patients. An initial screen identified 82 transcripts encoding molecules that are known
targets for existing drugs (see Methods). We further prioritized these candidates based on
an expert’s evaluation of the compatibility of use of the drugs for treating Covid-19 patients.
As an exception, module sets belonging to A28 (interferon response) were selected based
on their suitability as markers of a response to interferon therapy. Sets for which no targets
of clinical relevance were identified (16/28) were instead represented in the panel by
immunologically-relevant transcripts (defined earlier).
We ultimately identified a preliminary set of 12 targets through this high stringency
selection process (Table 4). Developing effective immune modulation therapies in critical
care settings has proven challenging (16). Current efforts in the context of Covid-19 disease
particularly aim at controlling runaway systemic immune responses or so called “cytokine
storms” that have been associated with organ damage and clinical worsening. Targets of
interest identified among our gene set include: 1) IL6R in A35/S2 (inflammation), encoding
the Interleukin-6 Receptor, which is a target for the biologic drug Tocilizumab. Several
studies have tested this antagonist in open label single arm trials in Covid-19 patients with
the intent of blocking the cytokine storm associated with severe Covid-19 infection (17,18).
2) CCR2 in A26/1 (monocytes), encoding the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2, is targeted
along with CCR5 by the drug Cenicriviroc. This drug exerts potent anti-inflammatory activity
(19). 3) TBXA2R in A31/1 (platelets), encoding the Thromboxane receptor, is targeted by
several drugs with anti-platelet aggregation properties (20). 4) PDE8A in A33/S1
(inflammation), encoding Phosphodiesterase 8A, is targeted by Pentoxifylline, a nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases perfusion and may reduce risk of acute
kidney injury and attenuates LPS-induced inflammation (21). 5) NQO1 in A8/S1
(Complement), encoding NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1. The NQO1 antagonist
Vatiquinone (EPI-743) has been found to inhibit ferroptosis (22), a process associated with
tissue injury (23), including in sepsis (24). A complete list is provided in Table 4.

The fact that this transcript panel and the previous survey the same pre-defined 28
homogenous Covid-19 relevant module sets should make them largely synonymous (since
modules are formed on the basis of co-expression). Nevertheless, this second panel may be
more relevant for investigators interested in investigating new therapeutic approaches or
measuring responses to treatment.

Design of a targeted panel of blood transcripts of relevance for SARS-CoV-2 biology
For the third panel designed in this proof of principle, we primarily selected
transcripts based on their relevance to SARS biology. As a first step, we used a literature
profiling tool to identify SARS, MERS, or Covid-19 literature articles that were associated
with transcripts forming the 28 Covid-19 module sets. Next, the potential associations were
subjected to expert curation (see Methods). Once again, to keep redundancies to a
minimum, we only included one candidate per set in this panel (Table 5). Notable examples
include: 1) LTF in A38/S1 (neutrophil activation) encodes Lactotransferrin, that is known to
block the binding of the SARS-CoV spike protein to host cells, thus exerting an inhibitory
function at the viral attachment stage (25). 2) FURIN in A37/S1 (Erythroid cells), encodes a
proprotein convertase that preactivates SARS-CoV-2, thus reducing its dependence on
target cell proteases for entry (26). 3) EGR1 in A7/S1 (Monocytes), encodes Early Growth
Response 1, which upon induction by SARS Coronavirus Papain-Like Protease mediates
up-Regulation of TGF-β1 (27). 4) STAT1 in A28/S3 (Interferon response), encodes a
transcription factor known to play an important role in the induction of antiviral effector
responses. It was reported that SARS ORF6 Antagonizes STAT1 function by preventing its
translocation to the nucleus and acts as an interferon antagonist in the context of SARS-CoV
infection (28).
This screen identified several molecules that may be of importance for SARS-CoV-2
entry and replication. It is expected that this knowledge will evolve rapidly over time and
frequent updates may be necessary. And, as for the previous two panels, investigators may

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.107243; this version posted May 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

also have an interest in including more than one candidate per module set. This of course
would also be feasible, although at the expense of course of parsimony.

Development of an annotation framework in support of signatures curation efforts
A vast amount of information is available to support the work of expert curators who are
responsible for finalizing the selection of candidates. This process often requires accessing
a number of different resources (e.g. those listed in Table 2). Here we have built upon
earlier efforts to aggregate this information in a manner that makes it seamlessly accessible
by the curators.
As proof of principle, we created dedicated, interactive presentations in Prezi for
module aggregates A28 ((24)) and A31 (https://prezi.com/view/zYCSLyo0nvJTwjfJkJqb/).
These presentations are intended, on the one hand, to aggregate contextual information that
can serve as a basis for data interpretation. On the other hand, they are intended to capture
the results of the interpretative efforts of expert curators.
The interactive presentations are organized in sections, each showing aggregated
information from a different level: module-sets, modules and transcripts (Figure 5). The
information derived from multiple online sources, including both third party applications and
custom applications developed by our team (Table 2). Among those is a web application
developed specifically for this work, which was used to generate the Covid-19 plots from
Ong et al. and Xiong et al. (Figure 5A). The interactive presentation itself permits to zoom in
and out, determine spatial relationships and interactively browse the very large compendium
of analysis reports and heatmaps generated as part of these annotation efforts. The last
section that contains transcript-centric information, is also the area where interpretations
from individual curators is aggregated.
We have annotated and interpreted some of the transcripts included in A31/S1 in
such a manner: 1) OXTR, which encodes for the Oxytocin receptor through which antiinflammatory and wound healing properties of Oxytocin are mediated (29). Among our
reference cohort datasets, OXTR is most highly increased in patients with S. aureus

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.107243; this version posted May 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

infection or active pulmonary tuberculosis (7).

2) CD9, which encodes a member of the

tetraspanin family, facilitates the condensation of receptors and proteases activating MERSCoV and promoting its rapid and efficient entry into host cells (30). 3) TNFSF4, which
encodes for OX40L and is a member of the TNF superfamily. Although OX40L is best known
as a T-cell co-stimulatory molecule, reports have also shown that it is present on the
neutrophil surface (31). Furthermore, OX40L blockade improved outcomes of sepsis in an
animal model.
Our interpretation efforts have been limited thus far by expediency. Certainly,
interpretation will be the object of future, more targeted efforts. In the meantime, this
annotation framework supports the selection of candidates forming the panels presented
here. It may also serve as a resource for investigators who wish to design custom panels of
their own.

DISCUSSION
Early reports point to profound immunological changes occurring in affected patients during
the course of a SARS-CoV-2 infection (32,33). In particular, patterns of immune dysfunction
have been associated with clinical deterioration and the onset of severe respiratory failure
(34). However, disease outcomes remain highly heterogeneous and factors contributing to
clinical deterioration are poorly understood. Among other modalities, means to establish
comprehensive immune monitoring in cohorts of Covid-19 patients are needed.
Here we designed an approach select and curate targeted blood transcript panels
relevant to Covid-19. When finalized, such panels could in turn serve as a basis for rapid
implementation of focused transcript profiling assays. This process should become possible
as more Covid-19 blood transcriptome profiling datasets become available in the coming
weeks and months. These data could, for instance, be used to refine the delineation of
Covid-19 module sets.
Because our selection strategy relies primarily on a pre-existing module repertoire
framework, we anticipate that changes would only be relatively minor. Indeed, one

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.107243; this version posted May 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

advantage of basing candidate selection on a repertoire of transcriptional modules is that it
permits to derive non-synonymous transcripts sets. In other words, each transcript included
in the panel could survey the abundance of a different module (signature). Basing selection
on differential expression instead, for instance, would tend to select multiple transcripts from
more dominant signatures (with highest significance / fold changes). But for more specific
purposes, such as differential diagnosis or prediction, machine learning models would be
more appropriate [for instance in sepsis studies: (35)]. Indeed, such panels have already
been developed for Covid-19 (36), and we anticipate that more will emerge over the coming
months.

However, our intent here was different: our primary aim was to support the

development of a solution that can monitor immune responses and functions.
Delineation of “immune trajectories” associated with clinical worsening of Covid-19
patients is one application to consider. Another application would be the measurement of
responses to therapy (as part of standard of care or a trial). The immune profiling of
asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic patients (e.g quarantined) would be another setting where
implementation of such an assay could prove useful. For this, it would for instance be
possible to use protocols that we have previously developed for home-based, self-sampling
and blood RNA stabilization (37,38).
Different connotations were given for the three panels, which are presented here as
a proof of principle. The panel consisting of immunologically relevant markers might have
the highest general interest. However, measuring changes in the abundance of transcripts
coding for molecules that are targetable by existing drugs could have higher translational
potential. Another illustrative panel comprises transcripts coding for molecules that are of
relevance to SARS-CoV-2 biology and might be of additional interest in investigations of
host–pathogens interactions. The common denominator between these panels is that they
comprise representative transcripts of each of the 28 module sets. Other transcript
combinations following the same principle would be possible, as well as the inclusion of
multiple transcripts from the same set for added robustness. The obvious disadvantage of
the latter, however, is the increase to the size of the panel. Medium-throughput technology

platforms, such as the Nanostring Ncounter System, Fluidigm Biomark or ThermoFisher
Openarray, would be appropriate for implementing custom profiling assays with the number
of targets comprising the tentative panels presented here (or a combination thereof).
Downsizing panels to comprise ±10 key markers might serve as a basis for implementation
on more ubiquitous real-time PCR platforms.
Overall, this work lays the ground for a framework that could support the
development of increasingly more refined and interpretable targeted panels for profiling
immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This should be possible in part through the
further development of environments providing investigators with seamless access to vast
amounts of annotations aggregated from different sources.

level. The columns on this heatmap represent samples (Xiong et al. & Ong et al.) or patient
cohorts (Altman et al.). Module aggregates (A1-A38) are arranged as rows. The colored
spots represent the proportion of transcripts comprising each transcriptional module
aggregate found to be differentially expressed compared to control samples. The cutoffs
vary from one study to another due to differences in the design and the profiling platforms
used. Thus, module aggregate response values range from 100% (all transcripts comprised
in the module aggregate increased) to -100% (all decreased). The Xiong et al. dataset
comprised one control and three Covid-19 patients and transcript abundance was measured
by RNA-seq. The Ong et al. dataset comprised three Covid-19 cases from whom samples
were collected serially, and nine uninfected controls (8). Transcript abundance was
measured using a 594 gene standard immune panel from Nanostring. Patterns are also
shown for cohorts comprised in the Altman et al. dataset (7). The colored labels (right)
indicate functional associations for some of the aggregates.

three Covid-19 patients comprising the Xiong et al. RNA-seq transcriptome datasets. The
top heatmap summarizes the module-level values for the six modules forming aggregate
A28. The color code indicates membership to one of the three Covid-19 module sets that
were defined earlier. The bottom heatmap shows patterns of abundance for the same six
modules, but at the individual gene level. The line graphs on the right show changes in
abundance for three transcripts from the “therapeutic relevance panel” in three Covid-19
patients profiled by Ong et al. using a generic Nanostring immune set comprising 594
transcripts.

Figure 5: High resolution annotation framework supporting the curation and
interpretation of Covid-19 module sets. This series of screenshots shows the content of
the interactive presentations that have been established to provide curators with access to
detailed annotations regarding modules forming a given aggregate, its constitutive modules
and targets that have been selected for inclusion in transcript panels. Links to interactive
presentations and resources mentioned below are available in Table 2.

aggregate-level information. This section displays patterns of transcript abundance across
the modules forming a given aggregate, as well as the degree of association of this
aggregate with the severity of RSV disease.

Plots used to populate this section were

generated using three web applications, including one that was developed in support of this
work that compiles the Covid-19 blood transcriptional data available to date. The other two
applications were developed as part of a previous study to generate plots for the reference
disease cohorts and RSV severity association plots (45). B. Module-level information.
This section includes, for a given module, reports from functional profiling tools as well as
patterns of transcript abundance across the genes forming the module. Drug targeting
profiles were added to provide another level of information. C. Gene-centric information.
The information includes curated pathways from the literature, articles and reports from
public resources. Gene-centric transcriptional profiles that are available via gene expression
browsing applications deployed by our group are also captured and used for context (GXB).
A synthesis of the information gathered by expert curation and potential relevance to SARSCov-2 infection can also be captured and presented here.

METHODS
Datasets
Two Covid-19 blood transcriptional datasets available at the time this work was conducted
were used: 1) Xiong et al. (9) obtained peripheral mononuclear cell samples obtained from
one uninfected control individual and three patients with Covid-19. RNA abundance was
profiled via RNAseq. The data were deposited in the Genome Sequence Archive of the
Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the accession number
CRA002390. FASTQ passed QC and were aligned to reference genome GRChg38/hg19
using Hisat2 (v2.05). BAM files were converted to a raw count expression matrix using
subreads (v1.6.2). Raw expression data was corrected for within lane and between lane
effects using R package EDASeq (v2.12.0) and quantile normalized using preprocessCore
(v1.36.0). The modular analysis was performed by using 10,617 RNA-seq genes which
overlapped with transcripts from the 3rd generation module construction (7). details of the
analysis as described below section.
2) Ong et al. (8) collected whole blood stabilized in RNA buffer from uninfected
controls and three Covid-19 patients at multiple time points. RNA abundance was profiled
using a standard immunology panel from Nanostring comprising 594 transcripts. The data
were deposited in the arrayexpress public repository with accession ID E-MTAB-8871. The
normalized data were downloaded, and modular analysis was performed by using 403
NanoString genes which overlapped with transcripts from the 3nd generation module
construction details of the analysis as described below section.
3) We also used a reference dataset generated by our group that was previously
used to construct the 382 blood transcriptional module repertoire (7). Briefly, this repertoire
consists of the following cohorts of patients and respective control subjects: S. aureus
infection (99 cases, 44 controls), sepsis (35 cases, 12 controls), tuberculosis (23 cases, 11
controls), Influenza (25 cases, 14 controls), RSV infection (70 cases, 14 controls), HIV
infection (28 cases, 35 controls), systemic lupus erythematosus (55 cases, 14 controls),
multiple sclerosis (34 cases, 22 controls), juvenile dermatomyositis (40 cases, 9 controls),

Kawasaki disease (21 cases, 23 controls), systemic onset idiopathic arthritis (62 cases, 23
controls), COPD (19 cases, 24 controls), melanoma (22 cases, 5 controls), pregnancy (25
cases, 20 controls), liver transplant recipients (94 cases, 30 controls), and B-cell deficiency
(20 cases, 13 controls). All samples were run at the same facility on Illumina HumanHT-12
v3.0 Gene Expression BeadChips. The data have been deposited in NCBI GEO with
accession number GSE100150.

Transcriptional module repertoire
The method used to construct the transcriptional module repertoire has been described
elsewhere (39,40). The version used here is the third and last to have been developed by
our group over a period of 12 years. It is the object of a separate publication (available on a
pre-print server (7)).
Briefly, the approach consists of identifying sets of co-expressed transcripts in a wide
range of pathological or physiological states, focusing in this case on the blood
transcriptome as the biological system. We determined co-expression based on patterns of
co-clustering observed for all gene pairs across the collection of 16 reference datasets listed
in the previous section and that encompassed viral and bacterial infectious diseases as well
as several inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, B-cell deficiency, liver transplantation,
stage IV melanoma and pregnancy. Overall, this collection comprised 985 blood
transcriptome profiles. A weighted, co-expression network was built with the weight of the
nodes connecting a gene pair being based on the number of times co-clustering was
observed for the pair among the 16 reference datasets. Thus, the weights ranged from 1
(where co-clustering occurs in one of 16 datasets) to 16 (where co-clustering occurs in all 16
datasets). Next, this network was mined using a graph theory algorithm to define subsets of
densely connected gene sets that constituted our module repertoire (“Cliques” and
“Paracliques”).
Overall, 382 transcriptional modules were identified, encompassing 14,168
transcripts. A supplemental file including the definition of this module repertoire along with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.107243; this version posted May 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

the functional annotations is available elsewhere (7). To provide another level of granularity
and facilitate data interpretation, a second round of clustering was performed to group the
modules into “aggregates”. This process was achieved by grouping the set of 382 modules
according to the patterns of transcript abundance across the 16 reference datasets that were
used for module construction. This segregation resulted in the formation of 38 aggregates,
each comprising between one and 42 modules.

Module repertoire analyses
The modular analyses were performed using the core set of 14,168 transcripts forming the
module repertoire. For group-level comparisons (cases vs controls), a paired t-test was
performed on the log2-transformed data [Fold change (FC) cut off = 1.5; FDR cut off = 0.1].
For individual-level analyses, each sample was compared to the mean value of the
corresponding control samples (or individual sample in the case of the Xiong et al. dataset).
The cut off comprised an absolute FC >1.5 and a difference in counts >10. The results for
each module are reported as the percentage of its constitutive transcripts that increased or
decreased in abundance. Because the genes comprised in a module are selected based on
the co-expression observed in blood, the changes in abundance within a given module tend
to be coordinated and the dominant trend is therefore selected (the greater value of the
percentage increased vs. percentage decreased). Thus, the values range from -100% (all
constitutive modules are decreased) to +100% (all constitutive modules are increased). A
module was considered to be “responsive” when the proportion of transcripts found to be
increased was >15%, or when the proportion of transcripts found to be decreased was
≤15%. At the aggregate-level, the percent values of the constitutive modules were averaged.

Data visualization
Changes in transcript abundance reduced at the module or module aggregate-level were
visualized using a custom fingerprint heatmap format. For each module, the percentage of
increased transcripts is represented by a red spot and the percentage of decreased

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.107243; this version posted May 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

transcripts is represented by a blue spot. The fingerprint grid plots were generated using
“ComplexHeatmap” (41). A web application was developed to generate the plots and browse
modules and module aggregates (https://drinchai.shinyapps.io/COVID_19_project/). A
detailed description and source code will be available as part of a separate publication
BioRxiv deposition on GitHub and BioRxiv (in preparation).

Selection of transcripts for inclusion in targeted panels
Therapeutic relevance: Covid-19 module sets belonging to aggregates comprising module
annotations relating to inflammation, monocytes, neutrophils or coagulation pathway were
selected for screening (A7, A8, A26, A31, A33, A34, A35). In turn, transcripts from each of
the corresponding module sets were selected on the basis of their status as a known
therapeutic

target

for

(source:

targetvalidation.org). Next, candidates were prioritized via expert curation on the basis of
compatibility and a potential benefit as a Covid-19 treatment. Curators were tasked with
prioritizing candidates within each of the Covid-19 module sets. Only the top ranked
candidate from each set was selected for inclusion in the panel. Module sets from aggregate
A28 (interferon response) may also be of clinical relevance, may also be of clinical
relevance, as indicators of a treatment response since interferon administration has been
shown to increase the activity of anti-viral drugs in Covid-19 patients (42). The selection of
candidates for aggregate A28 sets was thus based on the amplitude of the response to betainterferon therapy measured in patients with multiple sclerosis [fold-change over pretreatment baseline (43) & NCBI GEO accession GSE26104]. The remaining nine
aggregates, which tended to associate preferentially with adaptive immune responses and
for which targeting by therapies might prove detrimental, were not included in this screen.
For these, representative transcripts from the default panel of immune relevant transcripts
were included.
Relevance to Coronavirus biology: for the second panel, transcripts were primarily
selected based on their relevance to SARS biology. As a first step, a literature profiling tool

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.107243; this version posted May 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

was used to identify among the SARS, MERS, or Covid-19 literature articles that were
associated with transcripts forming the 28 Covid-19 module sets (Literature Lab, Gene
Profiler module; Accumenta Biotech, Boston, MA). Next, the potential associations were
assessed by manual curation. The curators prioritized the transcripts for which the
associations could be confirmed based on importance and robustness.
Immunological relevance: Lists of immunologically relevant genes were retrieved
from Immport (44), and were used along with membership to IPA pathways (Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis, QIAGEN, Germantown MD) to annotate transcripts comprising Covid-19
module sets. The curators prioritized annotated transcripts on the basis of their relevance to
the functional annotations of the module set (e.g. interferon, inflammation, cytotoxic cells).
The transcript with the highest priority rank was included in the assay.
Housekeeping genes: A recommended set of housekeeping genes is provided in
Table 6. These were selected on the basis of low variance observed across the 985
transcriptome profiles generated for our reference cohorts.

Annotation framework
Links to the resources described in this section and to video demonstrations are available in
Table 2. Interactive presentations were created via the Prezi web application. For this we
have built and expanded upon an annotation framework established as part of the
characterization of our reference blood transcriptome repertoire (7). Several bioinformatic
resources were used to populate interactive presentations that served as a framework for
annotation of Covid-19 relevant module sets. These resources include web applications
deployed using Shiny R, which permit to plot transcript abundance patterns at the module
and aggregate levels. Two of these applications were developed as part of a previous work
establishing the blood transcriptome repertoire and applying it in the context of a metaanalysis of six public RSV datasets (12). A third application was developed as part of this
work and can generate profiles at the transcript, module and module-aggregate levels for the
Xiong et al. and Ong et al. datasets.
