SUMMARY (150 words)

35

Betacoronaviruses (betaCoVs) caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and

36

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, and now the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

37

Vaccines that elicit protective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs

38

circulating in animals have the potential to prevent future betaCoV pandemics. Here, we show

39

that immunization of macaques with a multimeric SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD)

40

nanoparticle adjuvanted with 3M-052-Alum elicited cross-neutralizing antibody responses

41

against SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, batCoVs and the UK B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 mutant virus.

42

Nanoparticle vaccination resulted in a SARS-CoV-2 reciprocal geometric mean neutralization

43

titer of 47,216, and robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 in macaque upper and lower

44

respiratory tracts. Importantly, nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding a stabilized transmembrane

45

spike or monomeric RBD protein also induced SARS-CoV-1 and batCoV cross-neutralizing

46

antibodies, albeit at lower titers. These results demonstrate current mRNA vaccines may

47

provide some protection from future zoonotic betaCoV outbreaks, and provide a platform for

48

further development of pan-betaCoV nanoparticle vaccines.

MAIN

51

The emergence of three betacoronavirus (BetaCoV) outbreaks over the last 18 years

52

necessitates the development of countermeasures that can prevent future pandemics

53

SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (betaCoV group 2b) and MERS (betaCoV group 2c) emerged

54

from cross-species transmission events where humans were infected with bat or camel CoVs 5-

55

9

56

to the human ACE2 receptor for virus entry circulate in civets, bats, and Malayan pangolins 5,6,10-

57

12

58

humans. Neutralizing antibodies can prevent or treat betaCoV infection and represent potential

59

countermeasures against current human betaCoVs and pre-emergent viruses 13-22. Cross-

1-4

.

. In particular, betaCoVs that are genetically similar to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and bind

. Thus, SARS-related animal coronaviruses represent betaCoVs that can be transmitted to

60

neutralizing antibodies capable of neutralizing multiple betaCoVs, have been isolated from

61

SARS-CoV-1 infected humans 13,23,24, providing proof-of-concept for development of betaCoV

62

vaccines against group 2b Sarbecoviruses 25. A critical target of cross-neutralizing antibodies is

63

the receptor binding domain (RBD) 22,23,25. RBD immunogenicity can be augmented by arraying

64

multiple copies of it on nanoparticles, mimicking multimeric virus-like particles 26-30. Vaccine

65

induction of cross-neutralizing antibodies has been reported in in vitro neutralization assays

66

against CoV pseudoviruses in mice 29,30. However, it is unknown whether spike vaccination of

67

primates can elicit cross-neutralizing betaCoV antibodies against SARS-CoV-1, bat betaCoVs,

68

or against SARS-CoV-2 escape viruses. Here, we demonstrate the ability of a SARS-CoV-2

69

RBD 24-mer subunit nanoparticle vaccine—produced with an easily modifiable sortase-ferritin

70

platform31—to elicit in monkeys potent cross-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-1,

71

SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7, as well as SARS-related bat betaCoVs. RBD

72

nanoparticle vaccination protected monkeys against SARS-CoV-2 after respiratory challenge.

73

Lastly, we show lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated Spike mRNA vaccines similar to those in

74

clinical use elicit cross-neutralizing CoV antibodies, albeit at lower titers.

75
76

We and others have demonstrated the SARS-CoV-2 RBD has an epitope to which broadly

77

cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies can bind

78

neutralizes SARS-CoV-1, CoV-2 and bat CoVs24.To focus the immune response on cross-

79

reactive neutralizing epitopes on betaCoVs, we designed a 24-mer SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ferritin

80

nanoparticle vaccine. The RBD nanoparticle was constructed by first expressing recombinant

81

SARS-CoV-2 RBD with a C-terminal sortase A donor sequence. Next, we expressed the 24-

82

subunit, self-assembling protein nanoparticle Helicobacter pylori ferritin with an N-terminal

83

sortase A acceptor sequence

84

together by a sortase A reaction (Fig. 1a, Extended data Fig. 1) 31. Analytical size exclusion

85

chromatography and negative stain electron microscopy confirmed that RBD was conjugated to

31

13,24,32

, and the DH1047 RBD antibody cross-

. The RBD and H. pylori ferritin nanoparticle were conjugated

86

the surface of the ferritin nanoparticle (Fig. 1a, Extended data Fig. 1b,c). The RBD sortase A

87

conjugated nanoparticle (RBD-scNP) bound to human ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and

88

to potently neutralizing RBD antibodies DH1041, DH1042, DH1043, DH1044, and DH1045 24

89

(Fig. 1b). The epitopes of these antibodies are focused on the receptor binding motif within the

90

RBD 24. Cross-neutralizing antibody DH1047 also bound to the RBD-scNP (Fig. 1b). The RBD

91

scNP lacked binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies that bound outside of the RBD (Fig. 1b).

92
93

To assess immunogenicity of the RBD scNP, we immunized five cynomolgus macaques three

94

times intramuscularly four weeks apart (Fig. 1c). Immunogenicity of the protein was adjuvanted

95

with the TLR7/8 agonist 3M-052 absorbed to alum 33. After a single immunization, all five

96

macaques generated binding IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 RBD and stabilized Spike

97

ectodomain (S-2P) (Fig. 1d). Boosting once maximally increased plasma SARS-CoV-2 RBD

98

and S-2P-specific IgG antibody titers (Fig. 1d). ACE2 competitive binding assays demonstrated

99

the presence of antibodies against the ACE2 binding site within the receptor binding domain.

100

Plasma antibodies blocked the ACE2 binding site on SARS-CoV-2 S-2P by 52% after one

101

immunization and 100% after two immunizations (Fig. 1e). Similarly, plasma antibodies blocked

102

the binding of ACE2-binding site-focused, RBD neutralizing antibody DH1041, although to a

103

lesser degree than ACE2 (Fig. 1e). Vaccine induction of neutralizing antibodies was assessed

104

against a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with an aspartic acid to glycine substitution at position 614

105

(D614G)34. Two RBD scNP immunizations induced potent serum neutralizing antibodies (Fig.

106

1f-h). The fifty percent inhibitory reciprocal serum dilution (ID50) neutralization titers ranged

107

from 21,292 to 162,603 (Fig. 1g). In cynomolgus macaques, serum neutralization titers against

108

SARS-CoV-2 D614G pseudovirus elicited by RBD-scNP immunization were significantly higher

109

than titers elicited by stabilized transmembrane (TM) Spike (S-2P) lipid-encapsulated

110

nucleoside-modified mRNA (mRNA-LNP) immunization that is analogous to the immunogen and

111

vaccine platform in the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines (Fig. 1i, P<0.01

112

Exact Wilcoxon test, n=5)35,36. The group geometric mean ID50, measured as reciprocal serum

113

dilution, for the macaques immunized with RBD-ScNP was 47,216 compared to 6,469 for

114

mRNA-LNP immunized macaques. When compared to natural infection, RBD-scNP vaccination

115

elicited ID50 neutralization titers higher than those elicited in humans with SARS-CoV-2

116

symptomatic infection, asymptomatic infection, or infection requiring hospitalization (Fig. 1j).

117

Thus, RBD-scNP vaccination elicits significantly higher neutralizing titers compared to current

118

vaccine platforms and natural infection.

119
120

The new SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 is widespread in the United Kingdom (UK) and is

121

spreading globally37,38. Moreover, the B.1.1.7 variant has been suggested to have higher

122

infectivity and has mutations in the receptor binding domain that may limit neutralization efficacy

123

of RBD-specific antibodies 37,38. Therefore, we tested the serum from the RBD-scNP-vaccinated

124

macaques against a pseudovirus with B.1.1.7 spike. The macaque serum potently neutralized a

125

pseudovirus bearing the Spike from the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2a,b). Similarly,

126

neutralizing antibodies elicited by mRNA-LNP encoding the stabilized TM spike neutralized the

127

B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 equally as well the D614G variant of SARS-CoV-2, albeit at

128

titers below those observed with RBD-scNP immunization (Fig. 2a,b). Thus, the potentially

129

more transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 was equally susceptible to vaccine-induced

130

neutralizing antibodies as the SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant. Additionally, we determined RBD-

131

scNP and S-2P mRNA-LNP immune plasma IgG binding to S ectodomain spike proteins

132

containing mutations observed in strains circulating in Danish minks, as well as B1.351, P.1,

133

and B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 strains 38-40. As a control, we tested ACE2 receptor and SARS-CoV-2

134

cross-neutralizing antibody DH1047 binding to each spike mutant. The presence of D614G

135

increased binding to spike by ACE2 and RBD cross-reactive antibody DH1047 (Fig. 2c,d).

136

Similarly, plasma IgG from S-2P mRNA-LNP-immunized macaques and RBD-scNP-immunized

137

macaques exhibited increased binding to spike in the presence of D614G (Fig. 2c,d). The

138

addition of mutations from mink strains of SARS-CoV-2, the South African B1.351, Brazilian P.1

139

strain, and UK B.1.1.7 strains did not change binding magnitude for DH1047 nor macaque

140

plasma IgG (Fig. 2c,d). However, the addition of these mutations slightly increased ACE2

141

binding compared to D614G alone (Fig. 2c). Next we tested binding to recombinant RBD

142

monomers with and without the K417N, E484K, and N501Y mutations present in the B1.351

143

variant. ACE2 binding was decreased by K417N and increased by N501Y, while the RBD with

144

all three mutations showed no change in ACE2 binding (Fig. 2e). RBD neutralizing antibody

145

DH1041 is focused on the ACE2 binding site, and was knocked out by the E484K change (Fig.

146

2e). Importantly, the binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD for cross-reactive antibody DH1047 was

147

unchanged to RBDs with E484K or other mutations (Fig. 2f). Also, RBD-scNP-vaccinated

148

macaque plasma IgG and S-2P mRNA-LNP-immunized macaque plasma IgG were unaffected

149

by the RBD mutations (Fig. 2e,f). 41 Thus, RBD-scNP and mRNA-LNP-induced RBD binding

150

antibodies were not sensitive to spike mutations present in neutralization-resistant UK, South

151

Africa or Brazil SARS-CoV-2 variants.

152
153

While SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and variant neutralization remain a priority for halting the current

154

pandemic, additional SARS-related CoVs that circulate in humans and animals remain a threat

155

for future outbreaks 42-44. Therefore, we examined neutralization of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-related

156

batCoV-WIV-1 and SARS-related batCoV-SHC014 by immune serum from vaccinated

157

macaques6,10,43,44. After two immunizations, RBD-scNP, S-2P mRNA-LNP, and the RBD

158

monomer mRNA-LNP elicited neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-1, batCoV-WIV-1, and

159

batCoV-SHC014 (Fig. 3a, Extended data Fig. 2). Neutralization was more potent for

160

replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus compared to the other three SARS-related viruses

161

(Fig. 3a, Extended data Fig. 2). Among the three immunogens, RBD-scNP elicited the highest

162

neutralization titers and mRNA-LNP expressing monomer RBD elicited the lowest neutralization

163

titers (Fig. 3a, Extended data Fig. 2). Also, RBD-scNP immunization elicited cross-reactive IgG

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.17.431492; this version posted February 17, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

164

binding against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, batCoV-RaTG13, batCoV-SHC014, pangolin CoV-

165

GXP4L Spike proteins (Fig. 3c and Extended data Figs. 3a,c). RBD-scNP immune plasma IgG

166

did not bind the S ectodomain of four endemic human CoVs, nor did it bind MERS-CoV S

167

ectodomain (Extended data figs. 3a,c). The lack of binding by plasma IgG to these latter five S

168

ectodomains was consistent with RBD sequence divergence among groups 1, 2a, 2b and 2c

169

coronaviruses (Fig. 3e and Extended data figs. 4-6). Nonetheless, the SARS-CoV-2 spike

170

induced cross-reactive antibodies against multiple group 2b SARS-related betaCoVs, with the

171

highest titers induced by RBD-scNP.

172
173

The immune sera from RBD-scNP-immunized exhibited a similar cross-neutralizing profile as

174

the cross-neutralizing antibody DH1047. DH1047 binds with <0.02 nM affinity to monomeric

175

SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Extended data fig. 3b), and bound the RBD-scNP (Fig. 1b). DH1047

176

protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques and batCoV-WIV-1 infection in mice24; thus

177

the DH1047 epitope is a principal betacoronavirus (CoV) cross-neutralizing antibody target for

178

vaccination. The cross-reactive DH1047 epitope is adjacent to the N-terminus of the receptor

179

binding motif distinguishing it from dominant RBM-focused neutralizing antibodies such as

180

DH104124 (Fig. 3d). Antibodies targeting near the DH1047 epitope would be predicted to be

181

cross-reactive with group 2b betaCoVs given the high sequence conservation present in and

182

immediately proximal to the DH1047 epitope (Fig. 3e). Comparison of RBD sequences showed

183

them to be relatively conserved within betaCoV group 2b, but minimally conserved between

184

groups 2b and 2c (Fig. 3f and Extended data figs. 4-6). To examine whether RBD-scNP-

185

induced antibodies bound near the DH1047 epitope, we assessed plasma antibody blocking of

186

DH1047 binding to SARS-CoV-2 S-2P ectodomain. Plasma from all RBD-scNP immunized

187

macaques blocked the binding of ACE2 and DH1047 to SARS-CoV-2 S-2P ectodomain (Fig. 3g

188

and Extended data fig. 3d). Since DH1047-blocking plasma antibodies could be SARS-CoV-2-

189

specific, we also examined plasma IgG blocking of DH1047 binding to batCoV-SHC014. Similar

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.17.431492; this version posted February 17, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

190

to SARS-CoV-2 S binding, RBD-scNP plasma also blocked DH1047 binding to batCoV-SHC014

191

(Fig. 3g). While 96% of COVID-19 patients made antibodies that blocked ACE2 as a dominant

192

RBD response, only 31% made antibodies that blocked the cross-reactive antibody, DH1047

193

(Fig. 3h). Thus, in natural SARS-CoV-2 infection the cross-reactive DH1047 IgG blocking

194

response is subdominant, and RBD-scNP vaccination focused antibody responses to this

195

subdominant cross-reactive neutralizing epitope.

196
197

Finally, to determine whether vaccination elicited coronavirus protective immunity, we

198

challenged RBD scNP-vaccinated monkeys with 105 plaque forming units of SARS-CoV-2 virus

199

(Fig 4a). To assess virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract, E or N sgRNA was

200

quantified in fluid from nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) two and four days after

201

challenge (Fig 4a). In unimmunized macaques two days after challenge, there were on average

202

1.3x105 and 1.2x104 copies/mL of E gene sgRNA in the nasal swab and BAL fluids, respectively

203

(Fig. 4b,c). In contrast, vaccinated monkeys had undetectable levels of subgenomic envelope E

204

gene RNA in the upper and lower respiratory tract (Fig. 4b,c). We sampled monkeys again 2

205

days later to determine if detectable virus replication was present, but again found no detectable

206

E gene sgRNA in any monkey BAL or nasal swab samples (Fig. 4b,c). Similarly, all RBD-

207

scNP-vaccinated macaques had undetectable N gene sgRNA in BAL and the nasal swab fluid,

208

except one macaque that had 234 copies/mL of N gene sgRNA detected on day 2 in nasal

209

swab fluid (Fig. 4d,e). Viral replication was undetectable in this macaque by the fourth day after

210

challenge (Fig. 4d,e). Thus, RBD-scNP-induced immunity prevented virus replication, and likely

211

provided sterilizing immunity, in the upper and lower respiratory tract in all but one macaque.

212
213

This study demonstrates that immunization with SARS-CoV-2 Spike either as a protein RBD-

214

scNP or as an mRNA-LNP elicits a cross-reactive antibody response capable of neutralizing

215

multiple SARS-related human and bat betaCoVs. These results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2

216

vaccination with either the RBD-scNP or the stabilized transmembrane spike mRNA-LNP

217

vaccines currently approved for use in humans, will likely elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies with

218

the potential to prevent future animal CoV spillover events to humans 30,42,45. The ~one log

219

higher neutralization titers induced by RBD-scNP suggests improved durability of responses.

220
221

The identification of betaCoV cross-neutralizing antibodies such as DH1047 have shown that

222

the SARS-CoV-2 RBD contains a conserved betaCoV group 2b cross-neutralizing

223

epitope13,23,24,46,47. Vaccination of macaques in this study showed that cross-neutralizing

224

epitopes on RBD can be potently targeted by primates. A recent study reported mosaic RBD

225

nanoparticles arrayed with RBDs from various CoVs induced cross-neutralizing antibodies in

226

mice 30. Here, we show that cross-neutralizing antibodies are not only elicited by RBD

227

nanoparticles, but also by mRNA-LNPs expressing SARS-CoV-2 stabilized spike of the design

228

currently in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The 24-mer RBD-scNP nanoparticle protein adjuvanted

229

with a toll-like receptor agonist 3M-052 adsorbed to alum elicited the highest group 2b cross-

230

neutralizing antibody titers. 3M-052 formulated with alum or in an emulsion has induced Iong-

231

lasting memory B cells and protection against SHIV challenge in non-human primates48,49. A

232

Phase I clinical study using 3M-052/Alum to induce neutralizing antibody responses to an HIV

233

vaccine candidate is underway (NCT04177355). Thus, this vaccine modality represents a

234

promising first-generation pan-group 2b betaCoV vaccine with the potential to durably inhibit

235

future zoonotic transmission

25

.

236
237

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization-resistant and highly infectious variants continues

238

to be a concern for vaccine efficacy. We found here that protein nanoparticle or mRNA-LNP

239

SARS-CoV-2 spike immunization elicited SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies capable of

240

neutralizing the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant D614G as well as the newly-emerged B.1.1.7

241

UK variant. Thus, while the B.1.1.7 variant may be more transmissible, it was equally as

242

sensitive to vaccine-induced serum neutralization as the predominant circulating SARS-CoV-2

243

D614G strain. Importantly, cross-reactive RBD-scNP immune sera and S-2P mRNA-LNP

244

immune sera bound equally as well to spike ectodomain molecules with South African B1.351,

245

Brazilian P.1 and UK B.1.1.7 RBD mutations, and are compatible with the recent demonstration

246

that current COVID-19 vaccines have efficacy, albeit reduced, against the UK and South

247

African SARS-CoV-2 variants50-55.

248
249

Protection against asymptomatic infection and the durability of protection remain concerns for

250

current vaccines. The RBD-scNP vaccine induced robust protective immunity for SARS-CoV-2

251

replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract. This degree of virus suppression in the upper

252

respiratory tract has not been routinely achieved with SARS-CoV-2 challenge in macaques 56,57

253

and supports the notion of inducing SARS-CoV-2 sterilizing immunity with vaccination.

254

Additionally, the extraordinarily high neutralization titers achieved by RBD-scNP vaccination

255

bode well for an extended duration of protection. Critically, as we have had 3 coronavirus

256

epidemics in the past 20 years, there is a need to develop an effective pancoronavirus vaccine

257

prior to the next pandemic. The RBD-scNP vaccine induces neutralizing antibodies to SARS-

258

CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, batCoV-WIV-1 and batCoV-SCH014 and represents a platform for

259

producing a pancoronavirus vaccine that could prevent, rapidly temper, or extinguish the next

260

spillover of a coronavirus into humans.

439

and were performed based on standard operating procedures. Nucleoside-modified messenger

440

RNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNP) was prepared as previously stated

441

Rhesus macaques (n=8) were immunized intramuscularly with 50µg of mRNA-LNP encoding

442

the receptor binding domain monomer. Cynomolgus macaques (n=5) were immunized with

443

either 50µg of mRNA-LNP encoding the transmembrane Spike protein stabilized with K986P

444

and V987P mutations. An additional group of cynomolgus macaques (n=5) were immunized in

445

the quadriceps with 100 µg of RBD-scNP adjuvanted with 5 µg of 3M-052 formulated in alum33.

446

Biospecimens before challenge, 2 days post-challenge, and 4 days post challenge were

447

collected as described previously 24.

448

SARS-CoV-2 intranasal and intratracheal challenge. All animals were challenged at week 11

449

(3 weeks after last vaccination) through combined intratracheal (IT, 3.0 mL) and intranasal (IN,

450

0.5 mL per nostril) inoculation with an infectious dose of 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-

PFU/mL) from a p4 seed stock obtained from BEI Resources (NR-52281). The stock underwent

453

deep sequencing to confirm homology with the WA1/2020 isolate. Virus was stored at -80C

454

prior to use, thawed by hand and placed immediately on wet ice. Stock was diluted to 2.5x10 4

455

PFU/mL in PBS and vortexed gently for 5 seconds prior to inoculation. Nasal swabs,

456

bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), plasma, and serum samples were collected seven days before,

457

two days after, and four days after challenge. Unimmunized macaques (n=50 were used as a

458

negative control group. Protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by quantitative

2P and HexaPro 61 were transiently transfected in FreeStyle 293 cells (Thermo Fisher) using

465

Turbo293 (SpeedBiosystems) or 293Fectin (ThermoFisher). The constructs contained an HRV

466

3C-cleavable C-terminal twinStrepTagII-8xHis tag. On day 6, cell-free culture supernatant was

467

generated by centrifugation of the culture and filtering through a 0.8 um filter. Protein was

468

purified from filtered cell culture supernatants by StrepTactin resin (IBA) and by size exclusion

469

chromatography using Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare) in 10 mM Tris pH8,150 mM NaCl or

470

2 mM Tris pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3. ACE-2-Fc was expressed by transient transfection

471

of Freestyle 293-F cells60. ACE2-Fc was purified from cell culture supernatant by HiTrap protein

472

A column chromatography and Superdex200 size exclusion chromatography in 10 mM Tris

473

pH8,150 mM NaCl. SARS-CoV-2 NTD was produced as previously described 62. SARS-CoV-2

474

fusion peptide was synthesized (GenScript).

Sortase A conjugation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to H. pylori ferritin nanoparticles. Wuhan

476

strain SARS-CoV-2 RBD was expressed with sortase A donor sequence LPETGG encoded at

477

its c-terminus. C-terminal to the sortase A donor sequence was an HRV-3C cleavage site, 8X

478

his tag, and a twin StrepTagII (IBA). The SARS-CoV-2 RBD was expressed in Freestyle293

479

cells and purified by StrepTactin affinity chromatography (IBA) and superdex200 size exclusion

480

chromatography as stated above. H. pylori ferritin particles were expressed with a pentaglycine

481

sortase A acceptor sequence encoded at its N-terminus of each subunit. For affinity purification

482

of ferritin particles, 6XHis tags were appended C-terminal to a HRV3C cleavage site. Ferritin

483

particles with a sortase A N-terminal tag were buffer exchanged into 50mM Tris, 150mM NaCI,

484

5mM CaCI2, pH7.5. 180 μM SARS-CoV-2 RBD was mixed with 120 μM of ferritin subunits and

485

incubated with 100 μM of sortase A overnight at room temperature. Following incubation

486

conjugated particles were isolated from free ferritin or free RBD by size exclusion

487

chromatography using a Superose6 16/60 column.

minutes in PBS. ACE2 and monoclonal antibodies were diluted to 20 µg/mL in PBS and placed

491

in black 96-well assay plate. The influenza antibody CH65 was used as the background

492

reference antibody. The RBD nanoparticle was diluted to 50 µg/mL in PBS and added to the

493

assay plate. Sensor tips were loaded with antibody for 120 s. Subsequently, the sensor tips

494

were washed for 60 s in PBS to removed unbound antibody. The sensor tips were incubated in

495

a fresh well of PBS to establish baseline reading before being dipped into RBD-scNP to allow

496

association for 400 s. To measure dissociation of the antibody-RBD-scNP complex, the tip was

497

incubated in PBS for 600 s. At the end of dissociation, the tip was ejected and a new tip was

498

attached to load another antibody. The data was analyzed with Data Analysis HT v12

499

(ForteBio). Background binding observed with CH65 was subtracted from all values. All binding

500

curves were aligned to the start of association. The binding response at the end of the 400 s

501

association phase was plotted in GraphPad Prism v9.0.

502

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. SPR measurements of DH1047 antigen binding

503

fragment (Fab) binding to monomeric SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins

504

were performed in HBS-EP+ running buffer using a Biacore S200 instrument (Cytiva). Assays

505

were performed in the DHVI BIA Core Facility. The RBD was first captured via its twin-

506

StrepTagII onto a Series S Streptavidin chip to a level of 300-400 resonance units (RU). The

507

antibody Fabs were injected at 0.5 to 500 nM over the captured S proteins using the single

508

cycle kinetics injection mode at a flow rate of 50 L/min. Fab association occurred for 180 s

509

followed by a dissociation of 360 seconds after the end of the association phase. At the end of

510

the dissociation phase the RBD was regenerated with a 30 s injection of glycine pH1.5. Binding

511

values were analyzed with Biacore S200 Evaluation software (Cytiva). References included

512

blank streptavidin surface along with blank buffer binding and was subtracted from DH1047

513

values to account for signal drift and non-specific protein binding. A 1:1 Langmuir model with a

514

local Rmax was used for curve fitting. Binding rates and constants were derived from the curve.

515

Representative results from two independent experiments are shown.

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization. Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped

517

virus was performed by adapting an infection assay described previously with lentiviral vectors

518

and infection in 293T/ACE2.MF (the cell line was kindly provided by Drs. Mike Farzan and

519

Huihui Mu at Scripps). Cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 50 µg/ml

520

gentamicin. An expression plasmid encoding codon-optimized full-length spike of the Wuhan-1

521

strain (VRC7480), was provided by Drs. Barney Graham and Kizzmekia Corbett at the Vaccine

522

Research Center, National Institutes of Health (USA). The D614G mutation was introduced into

523

VRC7480 by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed

524

Mutagenesis Kit from Agilent Technologies (Catalog # 210518). The mutation was confirmed by

525

full-length spike gene sequencing. Pseudovirions were produced in HEK 293T/17 cells (ATCC

526

cat. no. CRL-11268) by transfection using Fugene 6 (Promega, Catalog #E2692). Pseudovirions

527

for 293T/ACE2 infection were produced by co-transfection with a lentiviral backbone (pCMV

528

ΔR8.2) and firefly luciferase reporter gene (pHR' CMV Luc)

For 293T/ACE2 neutralization assays, a pre-titrated dose of virus was incubated with 8

532

serial 3-fold or 5-fold dilutions of mAbs in duplicate in a total volume of 150 µL for 1 hr at 37 C

533

in 96-well flat-bottom poly-L-lysine-coated culture plates (Corning Biocoat). Cells were

534

suspended using TrypLE express enzyme solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and immediately

535

added to all wells (10,000 cells in 100 µL of growth medium per well). One set of 8 control wells

536

received cells + virus (virus control) and another set of 8 wells received cells only (background

537

control). After 66-72 h of incubation, medium was removed by gentle aspiration and 30 µL of

538

Promega 1x lysis buffer was added to all wells. After a 10-minute incubation at room

539

temperature, 100 µl of Bright-Glo luciferase reagent was added to all wells. After 1-2 minutes,

540

110 µl of the cell lysate was transferred to a black/white plate (Perkin-Elmer). Luminescence

RLUs.

545

Plasma IgG blocking of ACE2 binding. For ACE2 blocking assays, plates were coated with 2

546

g/mL recombinant ACE2 protein, then washed and blocked with 3% BSA in 1X PBS. While

547

assay plates blocked, purified antibodies were diluted as stated above, only in 1% BSA with

548

0.05% Tween-20. In a separate dilution plate Spike-2P protein was mixed with the antibodies at

549

a final concentration equal to the EC50 at which spike binds to ACE2 protein. The mixture was

550

allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 hour. Blocked assay plates were then washed

551

and the antibody-spike mixture was added to the assay plates for a period of 1 hour at room

552

temperature. Plates were washed and a polyclonal rabbit serum against the same spike protein

553

(nCoV-1 nCoV-2P.293F) was added for 1 hour, washed and detected with goat anti rabbit-HRP

554

(Abcam cat# ab97080) followed by TMB substrate. The extent to which antibodies were able to

555

block the binding spike protein to ACE2 was determined by comparing the OD of antibody

556

samples at 450 nm to the OD of samples containing spike protein only with no antibody. The

557

following formula was used to calculate percent blocking: blocking% = (100 - (OD sample/OD of

558

spike only)*100).

559

Plasma IgG blocking of RBD monoclonal antibody binding. Blocking assays for DH1041

560

and DH1047 were performed as stated above for ACE2, except plates were coated with either

561

DH1041 or DH1047 instead of ACE2.

597

was carried out on a QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

598

Waltham, MA) using the following thermal cycler parameters: heat to 50°C, hold for 2 min, heat

599

to 95°C, hold for 10 min, then the following parameters are repeated for 50 cycles: heat to 95°C,

600

hold for 15 seconds, cool to 60°C and hold for 1 minute. SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per reaction

601

were interpolated using quantification cycle data and a serial dilution of a highly characterized

602

custom DNA plasmid containing the SARS-CoV-2 envelope gene sequence. Mean RNA copies

603

per milliliter were then calculated by applying the assay dilution factor (DF=11.7). The limit of

604

detection (LOD) for this assay is approximately 62 RNA copies per mL of sample.

605

Live virus neutralization assays. Full-length SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, WIV-1, and

606

RsSHC014 viruses were designed to express nanoluciferase (nLuc) and were recovered via

607

reverse genetics as described previously 64-66. Virus titers were measured in Vero E6 USAMRIID

608

cells, as defined by plaque forming units (PFU) per ml, in a 6-well plate format in quadruplicate

609

biological replicates for accuracy. For the 96-well neutralization assay, Vero E6 USAMRID cells

610

were plated at 20,000 cells per well the day prior in clear bottom black walled plates. Cells were

611

inspected to ensure confluency on the day of assay. Serum samples were tested at a starting

612

dilution of 1:20 and were serially diluted 3-fold up to nine dilution spots. Serially diluted serum

613

samples were mixed in equal volume with diluted virus. Antibody-virus and virus only mixtures

614

were then incubated at 37 oC with 5% CO2 for one hour. Following incubation, serially diluted

615

sera and virus only controls were added in duplicate to the cells at 75 PFU at 37 oC with 5%

616

CO2. After 24 hours, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured via Nano-Glo

617

Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer specifications.

CA). Virus neutralization titers were defined as the sample dilution at which a 50% reduction in

620

RLU was observed relative to the average of the virus control wells.

621

Biocontainment and biosafety. All work described here was performed with approved

622

standard operating procedures for SARS-CoV-2 in a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility

623

conforming to requirements recommended in the Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories,

624

by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service, the U.S. Public Health Service, and the

625

U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Institutes of Health

626

(NIH).

627

Recombinant IgG production. Expi293-F cells were diluted to 2.5E6 cells/mL on the day of

628

transfection. Cells were co-transfected with Expifectamine and heavy and light chain expression

629

plasmids. Enhancers were added 16h after transfection. On day 5, the cell culture was cleared

630

of cells by centrifugation, filtered, and incubated with protein A beads overnight. The next day

631

the protein A resin was washed with Tris buffered saline and then added to a 25 mL column.

632

The resin was washed again and then glacial acetic acid was used to elute antibody off of the

633

protein A resin. The pH of the solution was neutralized with 1M Tris pH8. The antibody was

634

buffer exchanged into 25 mM sodium citrate pH6 supplemented with 150 mM NaCl, 0.2 μm

635

filtered, and frozen at -80C.

636

Negative stain electron microscopy. The RBD nanoparticle protein at ~1-5 mg/ml

637

concentration that had been flash frozen and stored at -80 °C was thawed in an aluminum block

638

at 37 °C for 5 minutes; then 1-4 µL of RBD nanoparticle was diluted to a final concentration of

639

0.1 mg/ml into room-temperature buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 5%

640

glycerol, and 7.5 mM glutaraldehyde. After 5 minutes cross-linking, excess glutaraldehyde was

641

quenched by adding sufficient 1 M Tris pH 7.4 stock to give a final concentration of 75 mM Tris

642

and incubated for 5 minutes. For negative stain, carbon-coated grids (EMS, CF300-cu-UL) were

643

glow-discharged for 20s at 15 mA, after which a 5-µl drop of quenched sample was incubated

644

on the grid for 10-15 s, blotted, and then stained with 2% uranyl formate. After air drying grids

were imaged with a Philips EM420 electron microscope operated at 120 kV, at

646

82,000 magnification and images captured with a 2k x 2k CCD camera at a pixel size of 4.02

647

Å.

648

Processing of negative stain images. The RELION 3.0 program was used for all negative

649

stain image processing. Images were imported, CTF-corrected with CTFFIND, and particles

650

were picked using a spike template from previous 2D class averages of spike alone. Extracted

651

particle stacks were subjected to 2-3 rounds of 2D class averaging and selection to discard junk

652

particles and background picks. Cleaned particle stacks were then subjected to 3D classification

653

using a starting model created from a bare spike model, PDB 6vsb, low-pass filtered to 30 Å.

654

Classes that showed clearly-defined Fabs were selected for final refinements followed by

655

automatic filtering and B-factor sharpening with the default Relion post-processing parameters.

656

Betacoronavirus sequence analysis. Heatmaps of amino acid sequence similarity were

657

computed for a representative set of betacoronaviruses using the ComplexHeatmap package in

658

R. Briefly, 1408 betacoronavirus sequences were retrieved from NCBI Genbank, aligned to the

659

Wuhan-1 spike protein sequence, and trimmed to the aligned region. The 1408 spike

660

sequences were then clustered using USEARCH

661

resulting in 52 clusters. We sampled one sequence from each cluster to generate a

662

representative set of sequences. Five betacoronavirus sequences of interest not originally

663

included in the clustered set were added: SARS-CoV-2, GXP4L, batCoV-RaTG13, batCoV-

664

SHC014, batCoV-WIV-1. This resulted in a set of 57 representative spike sequences. Pairs of

665

spike amino acid sequences were aligned using a global alignment and the BLOSUM62 scoring

666

matrix. For RBD and NTD domain alignments, spike sequences were aligned to the Wuhan 1

667

spike protein RBD region (residues 330-521) and NTD region (residues 27-292), respectively,

668

and trimmed to the aligned region. Phylogenetic tree construction of RBD sequences was

669

performed with Geneious Prime 2020.1.2 using the Neighbor Joining method and default

670

parameters. To map group 2b betaCoV sequence conservation onto the RBD structure, group

67

671

2b spike sequences were retrieved from Genbank and clustered using USEARCH

672

sequence identity threshold of 0.99 resulting in 39 clusters. For clusters of size >5, 5 spike

673

sequences were randomly downsampled from each cluster. The resulting set of 73 sequences

674

was aligned using MAFFT 68. Conservation scores for each position in the multiple sequence

675

alignment were calculated using the trident scoring method

676

program (https://github.com/gcollet/MstatX). The conservation scores were then mapped to the

677

RBD domain coordinates (PDB: 7LD1) and images rendered with PyMol version 2.3.5.

678

Statistics Analysis. Data were plotted using Prism GraphPad 8.0. Wilcoxon rank sum exact

679

test was performed to compare differences between groups with p-value < 0.05 considered

680

significant using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). No adjustments were made to the p-values

681

for multiple comparisons. IC50 and IC80 values were calculated using R statistical software

682

(version 4.0.0; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The R package ‘nplr’

683

was used to fit 4-Parameter Logistic (4-PL) regression curves to the average values from

684

duplicate experiments, and these fits were used to estimate the concentrations corresponding to

685

50% and 80% neutralization.
