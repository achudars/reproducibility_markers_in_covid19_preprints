ABSTRACT
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over ten million
patients worldwide. Although most coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have a good prognosis, some
develop severe illness. Markers that define disease severity or predict clinical outcome need to be urgently
developed as the mortality rate in critical cases is approximately 61.5%. In the present study, we performed indepth proteome profiling of undepleted plasma from eight COVID-19 patients. Quantitative proteomic analysis
using the BoxCar method revealed that 91 out of 1,222 quantified proteins were differentially expressed
depending on the severity of COVID-19. Importantly, we found 76 proteins, previously not reported, which
could be novel prognostic biomarker candidates. Our plasma proteome signatures captured the host response to
SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby highlighting the role of neutrophil activation, complement activation, platelet
function, and T cell suppression as well as proinflammatory factors upstream and downstream of interleukin-6,
interleukin-1B, and tumor necrosis factor. Consequently, this study supports the development of blood
biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets to aid clinical decision-making and subsequently improve prognosis
of COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented global health threat caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent studies have reported an astonishing
case fatality rate of 61.5% for critical cases, increasing sharply with age and in patients with underlying
comorbidities [1]. The severity and increasing number of cases, the medical services face immense pressure, and
there is a shortage of intensive care resources. To curtail the pandemic and return to normalcy, it is essential to
find markers that define the disease severity, have prognostic value, or predict a specific phase of the disease.
Unfortunately, no prognostic biomarkers are presently available that can distinguish patients requiring
immediate medical attention and estimate their associated mortality rates. Nevertheless, Yan et al. [2] reported
that blood-borne marker panels can identify the mortality rate in individual patients more than 10 days in
advance with >90% accuracy. Moreover, they suggested that tissue damage markers can be leveraged to predict
COVID-19 outcomes.
Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics may potentially be used as an ideal technology in this
situation as it can quickly deliver substantial amounts of clinical and biological information from blood plasma
or serum in an untargeted manner [3,4]. Furthermore, these MS-based proteomic workflows for biomarker
discovery and profiling are well established [3]. However, only two studies have presently applied proteomics to
the serum of COVID-19 patients with moderate proteome depth [5,6]. Therefore, detailed understanding of the
in-depth proteome of plasma or serum is necessary to develop prognostic or predictive protein markers.
In the present study, we performed in-depth proteome profiling of undepleted plasma samples using
the BoxCar acquisition method [7] from an exploratory cohort comprising 8 COVID-19 patients to identify
candidate biomarkers for evaluating the disease severity.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
2.1. Label-free quantification of plasma samples
Here, we report the in-depth plasma proteome data of the Korean COVID-19 cohort. Our dataset was
generated using the plasma samples collected from eight COVID-19 positively confirmed patients, including
three non-severe (mild) and five severe cases (Supplementary Table S1). The plasma proteome was analyzed via
ultra-high-resolution LC-MS and the proteins whose expression revealed significant differences were discovered
(Figure 1). We provided this in-depth proteome as a cornerstone to the communities doing research on COVID19.
To increase the proteome depth, we performed label-free quantification based on BoxCar acquisition
using a small amount (2 µl) of plasma sample without high-abundant protein depletion. In total, 1,639 proteins
were identified at the protein FDR 1% level. An average of 1,064 proteins were quantified in the individual
samples (Figure 2a). The details of the identified and quantified proteins are listed in Supplementary Table S2.
To identify the differences within and between groups, the protein profiles were plotted as multi-scatter plots,
and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) value between proteome pairs was calculated (Supplementary
Figure S1). The intra-group correlation displayed average PCCs of 0.82 and 0.80 in mild and severe groups,
respectively. The average PCC value of inter-group between the mild and severe was 0.78. Presumably, the
differences between groups were slightly larger than those within groups. The overall mass spectrometric
intensities presented no significant differences between all samples, although the plasma samples were prepared
based on equal volume and not on the amount of plasma protein (Supplementary Figure S2). Interestingly,
principal component analysis (PCA) performed using all identified plasma proteomes presented clear separation
of the samples, indicating that the plasma protein expression was considerably altered based on the clinical
symptoms (Figure 2b)
After considering the proteins quantified by at least 50% in either the mild or severe COVID-19
groups, 1,222 proteins were subjected to statistical analysis. Statistical tests revealed that the expression of 91
proteins significantly differed between mild and severe groups (Student’s t-test, p-value < 0.05, and |foldchange| > 1.5) (Figure 2c). These 91 proteins were regarded as DEPs and are summarized in Supplementary
Table S3.

2.2 Comparison with previous studies
After the outbreak of COVID-19, two articles that intensively explored proteomics to discover blood
biomarkers for COVID-19 have been published. Shen et al. analyzed the serum proteome and metabolome in a
Chinese cohort (N = 118), suggesting a set of proteins as serum biomarkers for classifying COVID-19 patients
[6]. Moreover, Messner et al. developed a high-throughput proteome analysis method and reported numerous
significant proteins that distinguished the severe group from the non-severe group [5]. To verify the
comprehensiveness of the proteome, our protein identifications and DEPs were compared with those of the
previously published articles. The comparative analysis revealed that our proteome data covered most of the
previous datasets, overlapping 71% and 72% of the proteome from Messner et al.’s dataset and Shen et al.’s
dataset, respectively (Figure 3). Furthermore, we found 76 significant proteins, previously not reported, which
could be novel biomarker candidates; however, the results differed from each other. Interestingly, although
proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A-1 (SAA1), protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor
(SERPINA10), and albumin (ALB) were previously reported as promising marker candidates, these proteins
could not fit into our criteria for differential expression. Presumably, the temporal gap between the blood sample
collection time and the first symptom may be a reason for this disparity. The blood samples in our cohort were
collected approximately 3 weeks after the first symptom, and the patients were treated with medications during
this period. Therefore, the severe symptoms of the patients would have been alleviated, and thus the level of
these proteins associated with acute responses would be restored to mild-symptom patients. Although numerous
proteins were excluded, the expression of CRP, SAA1, Complement factor B (CFB), Cofilin-1 (CFL1),
Complement C2 (C2), Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein (LRG1), Apolipoprotein C-I (APOC1), and
Serotransferrin (TF) revealed expression trend consistent with those of other studies with medium significance
(p-value < 0.1) (Supplementary Figure S3). The significant proteins reported in the two published articles are
listed in Supplementary Table S4.

2.3 Functional characteristics distinguish the severe COVID-19 group from the mild group
To recapitulate the functional characteristics of differentially expressed plasma proteome and further
suggest potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19, we investigated the biological functions and signaling
pathways associated with DEPs. The over-representative analysis using EnrichR [8] based on bioPlanet and

Wikipathway database derived numerous biological functions and signaling pathways satisfying the statistical
criteria (Fisher’s exact test p-value < 0.05) (Supplementary Table S5). Notably, the functions related to the
neutrophils and blood coagulation were mostly significant (Figure 4a). For example, the function “neutrophil
activation involved in immune response” was associated with nine upregulated proteins, including Polymeric
immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR), Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase C (ALDOC), Heat shock cognate 71 kDa
protein (HSPA8), Vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAPA), Ras GTPase-activatinglike protein (IQGAP2), Serpin B10 (SERPINB10), Alpha-1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1), and Alpha-1antichymotrypsin (SERPINA3), and was deduced as one of the most important functions (p-value = 1.12E-05).
Other similar terms such as “neutrophil degranulation” and “neutrophil mediated immunity” were also enriched
(p-value = 1.04E-05 and p-value = 1.19E-05, respectively). Recently, the role of neutrophils in severe COVID19 has received immense attention. Specifically, a microarray-based study of SARS-CoV-2 infected a peripheral
blood mononuclear cell (PMBC) and single cell analysis of epithelial and immune cells in COVID-19 patients
revealed that the neutrophil markers were overexpressed, suggesting that the patients were under neutrophilia
[9,10]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis based on gene network constructed from the published datasets derived
several neutrophil-enriched genes [11]. Other articles have reported that neutrophils and their extracellular traps
(Neutrophil extracellular traps, NETs) trigger COVID-19 [12,13]. Barnes et al. [12] argued that the NETs
formed by expelled proteins and DNA by neutrophils play a crucial role in protecting the host; however, the
excessive persistence of NETs induce a hyperinflammatory response and thus may damage the organs.
Moreover, they suggested that NETs also contribute to cytokine storm by stimulating macrophages to secrete
cytokines such as interleukin-1-beta (IL-1B) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Based on this perspective, the treatment
strategy for the regulation of NET in severe COVID-19 patients is deemed important.
Interestingly, identical functions were enriched in the downregulated proteins; Neutrophil defensin 3
(DEFA1), Cathepsin D (CTSD), Phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), Signal-regulatory protein beta-1
(SIRPB1), Ferritin heavy chain (FTH1), and ADP-ribosyl cyclase/cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase 2 (BST1)
enriched the “neutrophil activation involved in immune response” (p-value = 3.70E-05), “neutrophil
degranulation” (p-value = 3.53E-05), and “neutrophil mediated immunity” (p-value = 3.87E-05) (Figure 4b).
Our results revealed that the two protein groups are conflictingly affecting the activation of neutrophils (Figure
4c). The exact mechanism of these proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 infected blood cells need to be examined;
however, these protein levels in plasma efficiently differentiate between the COVID-19 mild and severe groups,

and thus, they could be suggested as potential prognostic markers.
Next, according to the study by Zhou et al., the proportion of coagulopathy increased significantly in
the COVID-19 death group [14]. A meta-analysis report revealed that COVID-19-confirmed patients presented
coagulopathy different from typical acute disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with the reduced levels of
the fibrinogen and relatively minimal changes in platelet counts [15]. According to the report, significantly
elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen levels were the most common finding in COVID-19-related coagulopathy
[13,15]. Other studies have also reported similar phenomenon revealing that severely affected COVID-19
patients are under a hypercoagulable state [16-18]. However, platelet counts in COVID-19 patients are variable
depending on the reported studies [15]. In the present study, upregulation of the proteins involved in regulating
complement and coagulation activation and platelet degranulation in the severe group can be considered as a
reflection of coagulopathy. Potentially, SARS-CoV-2 entry from angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) can
release intracellular angiotensin II, triggering platelet degranulation [19]. This resulted in inflammation and loss
of platelets via deposition in peripheral microvascular beds, thereby heralding thrombocytopenia and
intravascular coagulopathy in COVID-19 [20]. Presently, some experts cautiously suggest that severe COVID19 patients require medications with anticoagulation drugs as adjunctive therapy to reduce severity and
mortality [21], and our results support this treatment strategy.
Additionally, signaling pathway enrichment using EnrichR software also revealed that the upregulated
proteins in the severe group were predicted to be involved mainly in pathways related to platelet function and
coagulation, thereby further highlighting the importance of coagulation in COVID-19, as established by
previous observations in patients with severe symptoms [13,15-17]. Furthermore, the metabolism pathway was
presumed to be activated (Supplementary Figure S4a). In contrast, various signaling pathways were enriched in
downregulated proteins, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling, signaling events mediated by T cell protein
tyrosine phosphatase, and lysosome (Supplementary Figure S4b). Notably, a recent study reported that the
inhibition of IL-2 signaling may relate to the decreased CD8+ T cells in critical COVID-19 patients [22]. Here,
we observed downregulation of five proteins included in the IL-2 signaling pathway, such as Macrophage
colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1), Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (KDR), Myomegalin
(PDE4DIP), Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 3 (FAIM3), and CTSD, in critical patients, which may represent
another potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.
To identify potential therapeutic targets, we used the molecule–molecule interaction causality

information present in IPA. We constructed a regulator-target network using upstream regulators predicted to
regulate the DEPs found in this study (Figure 5). As a result, eight upstream regulators that regulate 28 DEPs
were discovered; of these, six regulators were increased and remaining two regulators were decreased. One of
the most significant regulators is IL-6, and the immune response triggered by it is activated in severe COVID-19
patients, as reported in previous publications [5,6,23,24]. In addition to IL-6, IL-1B and tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) are the major components of the cytokine storm commonly observed in severe COVID-19 patients [25].
The aforementioned results might be due to immune responses that naturally occur in COVID-19. Notably,
proto-oncoproteins such as Cellular tumor antigen p53 (TP53) and the Myc proto-oncogene protein (MYC)
family were predicted to regulate seven plasma DEPs. In particular, decrease in TP53 as well as increase in
MYC, were predicted. Presumably, the regulation of these proteins may contribute to cell proliferation,
particularly macrophages and neutrophils, in response to SARS-Cov-2 infection. In contrast, the regulated levels
of DEPs, including Proprotein convertase 1 inhibitor (PCSK1N), Galectin-3-binding protein (LGALS3BP),
Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), and ADP-ribosyl cyclase/cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase 2
(BST1), elicited a predicted increase in PDZ and LIM domain protein 2 (PDLIM2) levels. PDLIM2 has been
reported to inhibit T cell development, which is in accordance with previous reports on reduced numbers and
functional diversity of T cells in severe COVID-19 patients [26-28]. Moreover, the level of T cell receptor
(TCR) complex was reduced in our analysis. Therefore, it can be considered that the quantity or function of T
cells decreased as COVID-19 exacerbated. Nevertheless, our suggestion is based on in silico analysis; hence, the
role of regulators and their target proteins in severe COVID-19 should be verified via further functional studies.

METHODS
Patients and samples
Our team procured plasma samples from eight COVID-19 patients who visited the National Medical
Center between February and April 2020 (Supplementary Table S1). All patients with positive results for SARSCoV-2 infection, detected by analyzing the respiratory specimens via PCR, and willing to provide written
informed consent were eligible for participation. Treatment and medical interventions follow the standard of
care as recommended by the current international and Korean guidelines for COVID-19. The severity of
COVID-19 in this study was classified based on the requirement of oxygen support (mild = no oxygen support;
severe = oxygen support). The Ethics Committee and Institutional Review Board of the National Medical Center
(IRB no. H-2002-111-002) approved all experimental procedures. All experiments were performed following
the approved guidelines.

Sample preparation
The protein digestion process was optimized to 2 μl of each plasma or serum sample as previously
described with some modifications [29]. Briefly, 23 µl of digestion buffer, including reduction and alkylation
reagents, was added to 2 µl of blood plasma or serum. The mixture was boiled for 25 min at 60 °C to denature
and alkylate the proteins. After cooling to room temperature, proteins were digested at 37 °C overnight using a
trypsin/LysC mixture at 100:1 protein-to-protease ratio. The second digestion was performed at 37 °C for 2 h
using trypsin (enzyme-to-substrate ratio [w/w] of 1:1,000). All resulting peptides were acidified with 10%
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The acidified peptides were loaded onto a homemade styrenedivinylbenzene
reversed-phase sulfonate (SDB-RPS)-StageTips according to the previously described procedures [29,30]. The
peptides were initially washed with 0.2% TFA, and were then eluted with 80% acetonitrile (ACN) containing
1% ammonia. The eluate was vacuum-centrifuged to dryness and stored at −80 °C.

LC-MS/MS analysis
All LC-MS/MS analyses were performed using Quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometers, Q-exactive
HF-X (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) coupled to an Ultimate 3000 RSLC system (Dionex,

Sunnyvale, CA, USA) via a nanoelectrospray source, as described previously with some modifications [29,31].
Peptide samples were separated on a 2-column setup with a trap column (75 µm I.D. × 2 cm, C18 3 µm, 100 Å)
and an analytical column (50 µm I.D. × 15 cm, C18 1.9 um, 100 Å). Prior to sample injection, the dried peptide
samples were predissolved in solvent A (2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid). After loading the samples onto
the Nano LC, a 90-min gradient from 8% to 26% of solvent B (100% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) was
applied to all samples. The spray voltage was 2.0 kV in the positive ion mode, and the temperature of the heated
capillary was set to 320 °C. MaxQuant.Live version 1.2 was used to perform BoxCar acquisition [7,32]. The
MS1 resolution was set to 120,000 at m/z 200 for BoxCar, and the acquisition cycle comprised two BoxCar
scans at 12 boxes (scaled width, 1 Th overlap) with a maximum ion injection time of 20.8 per box with the
individual AGC target set to 250,000.

Spectral library generation
To generate spectral libraries for the BoxCar, 24 data-dependent acquisition (DDA) measurements of
the immunodepleted plasma samples were performed. DDA spectra were searched using the Maxquant against
Uniprot Human Database (December 2014, 88,657 entries) and the iRT standard peptide sequence.

Data processing for label-free quantification
Mass spectra were processed using MaxQuant version 1.6.1.0 [33]. MS/MS spectra were searched
against the Human Uniprot protein sequence database (December 2014, 88,657 entries) using the Andromeda
search engine [34]. In the global parameter, the BoxCar was set as the experimental type. Primary searches were
performed using a 6-ppm precursor ion tolerance for analyzing the total protein levels. The MS/MS ion
tolerance was set at 20 ppm. Cysteine carbamide-methylation was set as a fixed modification. N-Acetylation of
proteins and oxidation of methionine were set as variable modifications. Enzyme specificity was set to complete
tryptic digestion. Peptides with a minimum length of six amino acids and up to two missed-cleavages were
considered. The required false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1% at the peptide, protein, and modification
levels. To maximize the number of quantification events across samples, we enabled the “Match between Runs”
option on the MaxQuant platform. The MS proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange
Consortium via the PRIDE [35] partner repository with the data set identifier PXD020354.

Statistical analysis
For pair-wise analysis in plasma experiments, data were statistically analyzed using Perseus software
[36]. Initially, proteins only identified by site, reverse, and contaminants were removed. The expression level of
proteins in the plasma was estimated by determining their intensity based absolute quantification (iBAQ) values
calculated using Maxquant software. After log2 transformation was conducted for these values, valid values
were filtered using proteins with a minimum of 50% quantified values in at least one symptom group. Missing
values of the proteins were imputed based on a normal distribution (width = 0.5, down-shift = 1.8) to simulate
signals of low-abundance proteins. Two-sided t-tests were performed for pairwise comparisons of proteomes to
detect differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) with significant filtering criteria (p-value < 0.05 and fold-change
> 1.5). Protein abundances were subjected to z-normalization followed by hierarchical clustering with Pearson’s
correlation distance.

Bioinformatics analysis
Funtional gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis were performed using the EnrichR
online tool (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/) [8]. Upstream regulation and protein networks were evaluated
via Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) based on the DEPs in the plasma
experiment. The analytical algorithms embedded in IPA uses lists of DEPs to predict the biological processes
and pathways. The statistical significance of both the gene ontology classification and enrichment analysis was
determined by Fisher’s exact test. All statistical tests were two-sided, and p < 0.05 was considered as statistically
significant.

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, a class of emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS, and MERS, caused
worldwide health concerns. Although recent efforts can acquire the genetic sequence of the virus and initial data
on the epidemiology and clinical consequences of SARS-CoV-2, numerous important questions remain
unanswered, including its origin, extent, duration of transmission in humans, ability to infect other animal hosts,
and the spectrum and pathogenesis of human infections. In particular, insufficient biochemical knowledge will
make it difficult to identify the biomarkers and to define point-of-care clinical classifiers. MS-based proteomics
can present valuable and unbiased information about disease progression and therapeutic targets, without prior
knowledge about the etiologies and biomolecules.
To the best of our knowledge, with a total of 1,639 proteins identified and 1,222 proteins statistically
analyzed, this is the first comprehensive study of the plasma proteome for COVID-19 patients, which provides a
unique insight into the altered protein circulation based on the severity of COVID-19. We identified 91
differentially expressed plasma proteins between the mild and severe groups of COVID-19 and demonstrated
the potential of plasma proteome signatures. The proteome signatures captured the host response to COVID-19
infection, highlighting the role of neutrophil activation, complement activation, and platelet function.
Furthermore, our bioinformatics analysis indicated a high specificity of several inflammatory modulators,
particularly IL-6, IL-1B, and TNF. Overrepresentation of the suppressing factor of T cells (PDLIM2) was also
predicted. This study had certain limitation including the sample size of COVID-19 patients; the clinical
significance and statistical power would increase with more patients. Nevertheless, our in-depth plasma
proteome may provide insights into the development of prognostic biomarkers to support clinical decisionmaking as well as potential therapeutic targets.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. Overall scheme of in-depth plasma proteome profiling
Figure 2. Plasma proteome data generated using COVID-19 infected patients
(a) The number of proteins identified in each plasma sample as well as the number of total identifications is
plotted. (b) The result of principle component analysis (PCA) is depicted as 2-dimensional diagram. (c) The logtransformed student’s t-test p-value of each protein is plotted against the log-transformed fold-change. The
middle line indicates the p-value cut-off, 0.05. The proteins with high significance (top eight) were labeled.
Figure 3. Comparison with other SARS-CoV-2 blood proteome datasets
(a) The list of protein identification in our data is compared to that of previously published papers (Shen et al.,
2020, Cell and Messner et al., 2020, Cell systems). (b) The significant proteins proposed in each dataset were
compared. Two proteins Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (ITIH4) and Lipopolysaccharide-binding
protein (LBP) were commonly reported as significant.
Figure 4. Functional analysis of differentially expressed proteins
(a, b) Biological function enrichment analysis was performed using the upregulated or downregulated DEPs. If
the proteins on the left side were associated with the corresponding function, then they were filled with red. The
level of significance of each biological function is displayed as the length of red (a) and blue (b) bars overlapped
in the function term cell. (c) The expression levels of the 15 proteins associated with neutrophils were plotted.
Figure 5. Upstream regulator–downstream plasma DEP network
The upstream regulators that were known or reported to regulate the input DEPs at the upper level were
searched, and their status was calculated using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis bioinformatics tool. Eight
regulators were predicted to be upregulated and one to be downregulated. The upstream regulators, their
regulation targets, that is, plasma DEPs in our dataset, and the functional connections between them were
plotted.
