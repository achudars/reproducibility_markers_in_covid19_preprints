ABSTRACT
The SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein mediates viral entry into cells
expressing the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S protein engages ACE2
through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), an independently folded 197-amino acid
fragment of the 1273-amino acid S-protein protomer. The RBD is the primary SARS-CoV2 neutralizing epitope and a critical target of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Here we show that
this RBD conjugated to each of two carrier proteins elicited more potent neutralizing
responses in immunized rodents than did a similarly conjugated proline-stabilized S-protein
ectodomain. Nonetheless, the native RBD expresses inefficiently, limiting its usefulness as a
vaccine antigen. However, we show that an RBD engineered with four novel glycosylation
sites (gRBD) expresses markedly more efficiently, and generates a more potent neutralizing
responses as a DNA vaccine antigen, than the wild-type RBD or the full-length S protein,
especially when fused to multivalent carriers such as an H. pylori ferritin 24-mer. Further,
gRBD is more immunogenic than the wild-type RBD when administered as a subunit protein
vaccine. Our data suggest that multivalent gRBD antigens can reduce costs and doses, and
improve the immunogenicity, of all major classes of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

INTRODUCTION
Coronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded, positive-strand RNA viruses of the family
Corornaviridae (1). At least seven coronaviruses infect humans: the α-coronaviruses HCoV-229E
and HCoV-OC43, and the β-coronaviruses SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), HCoV-NL63, CoVHKU1, MERS-CoV, and the recently described SARS-CoV-2, a β-coronavirus closely related to
human SARS-CoV-1 (79.0% nucleotide identity) and to SARS-CoV-like variants isolated from
bats (2-4). SARS-CoV-2 infection causes flu-like symptoms in many patients, but in other cases
develops into an acute pulmonary syndrome (3, 5). SARS-CoV-1 causes severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), whereas disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 has been named COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV-1, requires expression of the cellular receptor ACE2 to infect cells
(6-8).
Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into ACE2-expressing cells is mediated by its spike (S) protein (7, 8). The
coronavirus S protein is a type I viral entry protein similar to influenza hemagglutinin and the
HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (9). Like these latter entry proteins, the S protein is processed into
two domains, S1 and S2 (7). S1 binds ACE2, whereas S2 anchors the S protein to the viral
membrane. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein has an efficient furin cleavage site at its S1/S2 boundary,
and this site is processed in virus-producing cells (10). In contrast, the SARS-CoV-1 S1/S2
junction is cleaved by extracellular or target-cell proteases including TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L
(11-13). Both S proteins require processing at a second site, S2’, within the S2 domain to mediate
fusion of the viral and target cell membranes (14).
The receptor-binding domains (RBDs, also described as SB) of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2
directly bind ACE2 (7, 15-17). These RBDs are structurally and functionally distinct from the
remainder of the S1 domain, and express and fold as independent domains (15). Both RBDs are
highly stable and held together by four disulfide bonds. Structural studies of the SARS-CoV-2
RBD bound to ACE2 have identified a variable region, termed the receptor-binding motif (RBM),
which directly engages ACE2 (16). This region is divergent between SARS-CoV-1 and SARSCoV-2, although both RBD bind ACE2 in the same orientation and rely on conserved, mostly
aromatic, residues to engage this receptor. The divergence between the SARS-CoV-1 and SARSCoV-2 RBM domains suggest that this region is subject to ongoing positive selection from the
humoral response in various hosts. However, some ten months into the pandemic, changes in the

SARS-CoV-2 RBD remain exceedingly rare, consistent with a relatively slow overall rate of viral
mutation throughout the genome.
Because the S protein is the major protein exposed on the virion, and because its activity can be
impeded with antibodies, it is likely the major target of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Soluble trimeric
S proteins, including those stabilized through various mechanisms, have been tested as SARSCoV-1 vaccines, and similar approaches are now being taken against SARS-CoV-2 (7, 17, 18). In
fact, all of the vaccines likely to be available in the first half of 2021 express or deliver a fulllength or ectodomain S protein, typically engineered with a pair of prolines designed to enhance
the stability of these constructs (19). Nonetheless, the neutralizing activity of these vaccines
correlates with RBD recognition, and the vast majority of potent neutralizing antibodies described
to date, including those in late-stage clinical trials, target the RBD (20-24).
A different approach, immunizing with the RBD alone, has been shown to raise potent neutralizing
antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 in rodents (25, 26). Although the RBD presents fewer epitopes
than the S-protein trimer, this approach may have key advantages. First, a much larger fraction of
RBD epitopes, essentially all RBD epitopes exposed on the native trimer, are neutralizing. Thus
the RBD has fewer decoy epitopes and a greater fraction of the antibodies elicited will be
neutralizing. Second, the 197-amino-acid RBD (S-protein residues 331-527) is much easier to
produce than the full S-protein trimer. Thus the costs of production of a subunit vaccine will be
lower, and expression from an mRNA or adenoviral vaccine will be greater, allowing dose sparing
and limiting side effects. Third, an RBD-based vaccine is less likely to include linear or
conformational epitopes that, in rare cases, might promote autoimmune disorders through
molecular mimicry. Similarly, fewer epitopes reduce residual concerns about antibody-dependent
enhancement, observed with other coronaviruses and primarily mediated through non-neutralizing
epitopes. Finally, multivalent antigens are typically more immunogenic than dimeric or trimeric
vaccines, and multivalency is much more easily obtained with RBD-based vaccines compared with
those based on S-protein trimers.
Here we show that when equal amounts of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein ectodomain or the RBD
alone were conjugated to each of two carrier proteins, the RBD generated neutralizing responses
equal to or greater than those of the S-protein. We nonetheless noted that the RBD expressed
inefficiently, especially as a fusion protein with a range of multivalent carrier proteins. We

therefore engineered the RBD to correct this deficiency and showed that this modified RBD, fused
to five different multivalent carrier proteins and expressed as DNA vaccines, elicited a more potent
neutralizing antibody responses than the wild-type RBD or the full-length proline-stabilized Sprotein antigen used in several prominent COVID-19 vaccines. Finally we show that our modified
RBD is more inherently immunogenic than the wild-type RBD when administered at equal dosage
as a subunit protein vaccine. These data suggest that future vaccines against COVID-19 should
include multivalent forms of engineered RBD antigens.
RESULTS
The SARS-CoV-2 RBD can elicit potent neutralizing antisera
The SARS-CoV-2 RBD, like that of SARS-CoV-1, is exposed in both known states of the Sprotein trimer, namely a closed state where each RBD contacts symmetrically its analogues on the
other protomer, and an open state in which at least one RBD domain is extended to contact ACE2.
We have previously shown that the SARS-CoV-1 RBD folds independently and expresses
efficiently, and that an immunoadhesin form of this RBD bound ACE2 more efficiently than
constructs based on the S1 domain (15). This construct, RBD-Fc, also efficiently raised antibodies
in mice capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-1 variants, including those with distinct RBD
sequences (25, 26). Moreover, the vast majority of well characterized neutralizing antibodies
against SARS-CoV-2, including those in late-stage clinical trials, target the RBD. These data
suggest that an RBD-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could be effective against virus throughout the
current COVID-19 pandemic.
To initially evaluate this possibility under optimal conditions, we evaluated the immunogenicity
of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD fused to the Fc domain as an expedient for rapid purification. RBD-Fc
was chemically conjugated to a Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) carrier protein and mixed with
the AS01 adjuvant formulation now used in at least two human vaccines (Fig. 1). This
antigen/adjuvant combination was inoculated intramuscularly into four female Sprague-Dawley
rats with a schedule of seven increasing (2.5-fold) doses, one each day, ultimately administering a
total of 500 µg of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc. Thirty days after the first administration, RBD fused
to a 4-amino acid C-tag was purified with a C-tag affinity column and administered as before.
Blood was harvested from each of the four rats (R15, R16, R17, R18) immediately before

inoculation (day 0) and 40 days after the first inoculation. Serial dilutions of day-0 and day-40 sera
were measured for their ability to neutralize retroviruses pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein (SARS2-PV). To estimate neutralization potency, these sera were also compared with a
mixture of all four day-0 preimmune sera, further combined with an immunoadhesin form of ACE2
(ACE2-Fc) at concentrations of 10, 100, and 1000 µg/ml before dilution. As anticipated, some
baseline inhibition could be observed in heat-inactivated rat sera (grey lines in Fig. 1A). However
day-40 serum from each rat, obtained after two sets of immunizations, potently neutralized
SARS2-PV entry with an efficiency comparable to or greater than day-0 preimmune sera mixed
with ACE2-Fc at a 100 µg/ml concentration (Fig. 1, A and B). We conclude that the SARS-CoV2 RBD can elicit a neutralizing response in vaccinated rats comparable to a 100 µg/ml (1 µM)
concentration of an inhibitor with a 1 nM IC50. To confirm that sera from vaccinated rats
neutralized SARS2-PV by recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we used each pooled serum to
prevent binding of an ACE2-Fc variant bearing a rabbit Fc domain (ACE2-rIg) from cells
expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Fig. 1C). The ability of pooled serum to compete with
ACE2-rIg indicates that these antisera neutralized SARS2-PV entry by blockading ACE2
association with the S protein. Thus, under ideal conditions, immunization with SARS-CoV-2
RBD elicits antibodies that very potently neutralize SARS2-PV, and these antibodies do so by
preventing S-protein association with ACE2.
One concern associated with coronavirus vaccines is the possibility that anti-S-protein antibodies
could promote infection of cells, such as alveolar macrophages, expressing Fc receptors, for
example FcγRI (CD64) or FcγRII (CD32). This undesirable antibody-dependent enhancement
(ADE) has been well characterized in tissue-culture studies of several flaviviruses including Zika
virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (27). To evaluate this possibility for SARS-CoV-2, SARS2-PV
were mixed with pooled day-0 or day-40 serum at the indicated serial dilutions, and the resulting
virus/sera mixtures were incubated with HEK293T cells transfected to express rat FcγRI. These
cells did not express ACE2 and no infection was observed with day-0 preimmune sera nor day-40
immune sera (Fig. S1A). In contrast, rat anti-ZIKV antisera, or day-0 preimmune sera incubated
at the same dilutions with ZIKV virus-like particles (VLP) promoted robust ADE (Fig. S1B). ADE
activity peaked at approximately a 3000-fold dilution, consistent with competition between ADE
and neutralizing activities of these antisera. Moreover, no SARS2-PV ADE was observed in the
presence of ACE2 (Fig. S2, C and D) or with K562 cells that endogenously express FcγRII (Fig.

S1, E and F) (28). Thus anti-RBD antisera do not mediate SARS2-PV ADE in the presence or
absence of ACE2 under the described conditions.
The RBD is more immunogenic than the S-protein ectodomain
To directly compare the immunogenicity of the RBD and a proline-stabilized S-protein
ectodomain, both proteins were fused at their C-termini to a SpyTag and conjugated to one of two
carrier systems (Fig. 2). First, each was conjugated by isopeptide bond formation to SpyCatchermi3 60-mer particles (RBD-mi3 and S-mi3) (29, 30). Second, the same proteins were conjugated
chemically to KLH as in Figure 1 (RBD-KLH and S-KLH). Four rats were vaccinated with each
antigen/carrier combination as in Fig. 1 except that one-fifth the total antigen (100 µg) was
administered for each vaccination round. Sera collected at day 0 and day 45 from each rat was
characterized for neutralization with SARS2-PV (Fig. S2) and the results were averaged (Fig. 2,
A and B). We observed that, with both carrier proteins, RBD conjugates elicited more potent
neutralizing responses at day 45 than did S-protein conjugates. We further observed that
conjugates to the mi3 60-mer elicited more potent responses than conjugates to the KLH carrier
protein. Thus RBD-mi3 was significantly more immunogenic than S-mi3, RBD-KLH and S-KLH
(Fig. 2C). We conclude that, when equal amounts of the RBD and the S-protein ectodomain are
conjugated to a carrier and administered with a potent adjuvant, the RBD elicits a more potent
neutralizing response. We also conclude that the mi3 carrier protein elicited more potent responses
to both antigens than did KLH.
A glycan-modified RBD, gRBD, administered as a protein, elicits a more potent neutralizing
response than does the wild-type RBD
Conjugates of the sort produced for Fig. 2 cannot readily be used with genetic vaccines such as
those delivered as DNA, or as mRNA, or through viral vectors. However fusion proteins that
express both the antigen and the carrier as a single polypeptide chain can be used in these formats.
Such fusion proteins also simplify the production of subunit protein vaccines. We therefore
undertook to produce fusion proteins with the RBD in various formats but observed that these
constructs were not efficiently produced in cells and were not efficiently secreted (Fig. S4). To
solve this problem, we developed a screening procedure whereby the expression levels of
engineered RBD variants, expressed as dimers, were monitored by flow cytometry. We observed

that one such variant, modified with four additional glycosylation sites in an RBD region occluded
in S-protein trimer (Fig. 3, A to C), expressed and secreted markedly more efficiently as a fusion
with the mi3 60-mer than did the unmodified RBD (Fig. 4A). Each of three of these newly
engineered glycans – those engineered at residues 370, 428, and 517 – markedly increased RBD
expression when fused to a multivalent carrier (Fig. S3), with the engineered glycosylation motif
at residue 517 contributing most to gRBD expression. A fourth glycan, at residue 394, did not
contribute to higher RBD expression, but it was included to further limit RBD aggregation.
We then investigated whether these additional glycans would alter immune responses to the RBD
(Fig. 4, B to E). Because fusions of the wild-type RBD with higher-order multivalent carrier
proteins proved difficult to express and purify, we produced RBD and gRBD as fusion proteins
with Fc domains of human IgG1 (wtRBD-Fc and gRBD-Fc). Two doses of 25 µg of RBD-Fc
antigen with 25 µg MPLA and 10 µg QuilA adjuvants, separated by 14 days, were administered
intramuscularly to five mice per group. Anti-sera were harvested 21 days after the first vaccination,
and analyzed for its ability to neutralize SARS2-PV or control pseudoviruses expressing the entry
(GP) protein of the lymphocytic choriomengingitis virus (LCMV-PV). Sera from inoculated mice
was mixed and compared with pre-immune sera and pre-immune sera mixed at an initial
concentration of 200 µg/ml ACE2-Fc. We observed, somewhat unexpectedly, that gRBD-Fc
elicited a more potent neutralizing response than did wtRBD-Fc (Fig. 4, B and C). Consistent with
this observation, sera from gRBD-Fc inoculated mice more efficiently bound cell-expressed S
protein (Fig. 4D) and more efficiently blocked binding of fluorescently labeled ACE2-Fc (Fig.
4E) than did sera from wtRBD-Fc-inoculated mice. Thus the engineered glycans of gRBD do not
interfere with, and may enhance its ability to raise anti-RBD antibodies in mice. We speculate that
gRBD glycans better focus the B-cell response to neutralizing RBD epitopes (31, 32).
Alternatively, aggregation of the wild-type RBD may impede access to these epitopes. Collectively
these data suggest that multivalent antigens based on gRBD will be easier to produce and at least
as immunogenic as their wild-type RBD analogues.
DNA vaccines expressing multivalent gRBD fusion proteins elicit more potent neutralizing
antisera than do the corresponding wtRBD fusion proteins or the full-length S protein

carriers (Fig. 5). Specifically, fusions with the IgG1 Fc-domain dimer (Fc), the T4 foldon
trimerizing domain (33), a dodecameric scaffold based on the H. pylori neutrophil-activating
protein (NAP) (34), the H. pylori ferritin 24-mer (35), and the engineered mi3 60-mer (29, 30).
Complete amino-acid sequences of these fusion proteins are provided in Fig. S4A. In each case,
the gRBD fusion protein expressed more efficiently than its wild-type RBD analogue (Fig. S4B).
We also evaluated a plasmid expressing the full-length proline-stabilized 1273 amino-acid S
protein (S1273-PP, the full-length S protein with prolines introduced at residues 986 and 987)
which expressed efficiently on the surface of HEK293T cells, more so than the otherwise identical
construct lacking these stabilizing prolines. (Fig. S4C). Five mice per group were electroporated
with 120 µg plasmid (60 µg per hind leg) encoding either wtRBD or gRBD antigen fused to each
of the aforementioned multivalent scaffolds, or with plasmid expressing the S1273-PP full-length
S protein. Mice were again electroporated 14 days later with the same plasmds. Sera were
harvested 21 days after the first inoculation. Combined sera for each group were evaluated for its
ability to neutralize SARS2-PV or LCMV-PV and compared with preimmune sera or preimmune
sera mixed with ACE2-Fc at an initial concentration of 200 µg/ml. In each case, sera from gRBDfusion constructs neutralized SARS2-PV more efficiently than their wtRBD analogues, and more
efficiently than sera from mice electroporated with S1273-PP (Fig. 5A). Among the various
scaffolds, the H. pylori ferritin 24-mer elicited the most potent neutralizing antisera (Fig. 5, B and
C). We conclude that gRBD consistently and significantly (P=0.0089, Fig. 5C) improves the
immunogenicity of multivalent fusion proteins relative to the same construct fused to the wildtype RBD.
DISCUSSION
For several reasons, a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 should be easier to develop than those against
many other viruses (9, 36). First, coronaviruses have exceptionally large genomes compared to
other RNA viruses, and, to avoid error catastrophe, their viral polymerase has acquired a proofreading function. Thus any individual gene, for example that of the S protein, is likely to retain its
original sequence over multiple replication cycles. Indeed now 9 months into the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic, few mutations in the S protein, and no dominant mutations in its RBD, have yet been
described. Second, coronaviruses in general, and clearly SARS-CoV-2 in particular, transmits to
a new host more rapidly than an adaptive immune response can emerge. A likely consequence of

this strategy is that one of its most critical epitopes, namely its RBD, is exposed on the virion (7,
9, 15, 17), favoring transmission efficiency over antibody resistance. Finally, the stability and
compactness of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD suggests that it can be easily
manufactured and presented to the immune system using many production technologies,
presentation scaffolds, and delivery systems (15). Here we repeat studies of the SARS-CoV-1 RBD
showing that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is sufficient to raise potent neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 1),
and that it does so more efficiently than the SARS-CoV-2 S protein ectodomain when conjugated
to a KLH or mi3 carrier and administered as a protein (Fig. 2).
However, the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 RBD suffers from one major deficiency. When expressed
as a fusion protein in multivalent scaffold or carrier, it is expressed inefficiently in cells, it secretes
poorly, and it tends to aggregate (Fig. 4A, Fig. S4B). This tendency to aggregate appears to impair
its immunogenicity, even when administered as a reasonably well-behaved Fc dimer (Fig. 4B).
Through trial-and-error screening of RBD variants modified in a region normally occluded on the
S-protein trimer, we identified a construct with four novel glycosylation motifs (Fig 3), that
substantially improved or rescued expression of all five multivalent protein carriers assayed (Fig.
S4B). Each of these glycosylation motifs improved expression or RBD solubility (Fig. S3). The
resulting engineered RBD, which we call gRBD to reflect its additional glycans, elicited more
potent neutralizing sera when administered as an adjuvanted protein (Fig. 4, B to E) or when
electroporated as a DNA vaccine expressing each of five carrier proteins (Fig. 5, A to C).
Importantly, these gRBD fusion proteins were more immunogenic than proline-stabilized S
proteins used as antigens in most prominent SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (Fig. 5B).
Our data therefore show that (1) the SARS-CoV-2 RBD can be more immunogenic than the S
protein, (2) an RBD engineered with four glycans can be more immunogenic than the wild-type
RBD, and (3) multivalent forms of the RBD and gRBD, and in particular those fused with the
H.pylori ferritin 24-mer, can be more immunogenic than dimeric or trimeric constructs. Why is
the RBD more immunogenic than the S protein? The answer appears straightforward: the RBD is
the dominant neutralizing epitope. Expression of the remainder of the protein taxes cellular
resources and exposes potential decoy epitopes. Why is gRBD more immunogenic than the wildtype RBD? We speculate that poor folding or solubility of the wild-type RBD help occlude its
major neutralizing epitopes or limit its access to the lymph nodes (37). It is also possible that the
glycans of gRBD mask dominant but non-neutralizing RBD epitopes. Finally, why is the ferritin

24-mer more immunogenic than the other scaffolds? Immunogenicity is likely improved by
multivalency, by higher expression, and by pre-existing T cell help (37, 38). The mi3 60-mer is
maximally multivalent, but it expresses relatively poorly and may include fewer epitopes
recognized by established memory T cells. The NAP 12-mer expresses much more efficiently, but
its size or the arrangement of gRBD domains may be sub-optimal. The Fc dimer and foldon trimer
may also be insufficiently multivalent, and again include fewer T-cell epitopes. The H. pylori
ferritin 24-mer combines high expression, a larger particle and high valency, and it provides Tcell epitopes similar to those in many bacterial antigens. Further work identifying and engineering
high-expressing multivalent scaffolds capable of presenting gRBD may yield even more potent
antigens.
In short, we have engineered a SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen that expresses more efficiently than the
wild-type RBD as a fusion with multivalent carrier proteins, and these fusion proteins are more
immunogenic as protein or DNA vaccines than commonly used S protein antigens. We propose
therefore that multivalent gRBD fusion proteins could improve production efficiencies of proteinbased SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and limit the doses necessary for all vaccine classes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Production of SARS-CoV-2 and LCMV pseudoviruses and Zika-virus virus-like particles
Retroviruses pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein or lymphocytic choriomenginitis virus
GP protein (SARS2-PV, LCMV-PV) were produced as previously described (Moore et al., 2004)
with modest modifications as described. HEK293T cells were transfected by polyethylenimine
(PEI) transfection at a ratio of 5:5:1 with a plasmid encoding murine leukemia virus (MLV)
gag/pol proteins, a retroviral vector pQCXIX expressing firefly luciferase, and a plasmid
expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank YP_009724390) or LCMV GP (GenBank
AHZ55917.1). Cells were washed 6 hours later, and the culture supernatant containing
pseudoviruses was harvested at 48-72 hours post transfection. Zika virus virus-like particles
(ZIKV-VLP) were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells by the calcium phosphate transfection
method with a ZIKV replicon (strain FS13025, GenBank KU955593.1), whose expression is

with fresh media containing 1 μg/ml doxycycline. The VLP-containing culture supernatant was
harvested 48 h post transfection. ZIKV replicon was generated by replacing the region spanning
39th through 763rd amino acids of the polyprotein of a ZIKV molecular clone we previously
generated (39) with Renilla luciferase with the 2A self-cleaving peptide fused atits C-terminus.
This construct contains the tetracycline-responsive Ptight promoter that drives ZIKV RNA
transcription. The pseudovirus- or VLP-containing culture supernatants were cleared by 0.45-µm
filtration. SARS2-PV and ZIKV-VLP titers were assessed by RT-qPCR targeting the CMV
promoter in the retroviral vector pQCXIX and ZIKV NS3 gene, respectively. In some cases,
clarified pseudovirus and VLP stocks were stored at -80oC for long-term storage and reuse.
Generation of human ACE2 expressing cell lines
HEK293T cells expressing human ACE2 (hACE2) were generated by transduction with murine
leukemia virus (MLV) pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein and expressing
myc-hACE2-c9, as previously described (Wicht et al., 2014). Briefly, HEK293T cells were cotransfected by PEI with three plasmids, pMLV-gag-pol, pCAGGS-VSV-G and pQCXIP-mychACE2-c9 at a ratio of 3:2:1, and medium was refreshed after overnight incubation of transfection
mix. The supernatant with produced virus was harvested 72-hours post transfection and clarified
by passing through 0.45μm filter. 293T-hACE2 cells transduced with MLV vectors were selected
and maintained with medium containing puromycin (Sigma). hACE2 expression was confirmed
by SARS1-PV and SARS2-PV entry assays and by immunofluorescence staining using mouse
monoclonal antibody recognizing c-Myc.
Protein Production
Expi293 cells (Thermo-Fisher) were transiently transfected using FectoPRO (Polyplus) with
plasmids encoding SARS-CoV2 RBD with a human or rabbit-Fc fusion or a C-terminal C-tag (EPEA). After 5 days in shaker culture, media were collected and cleared of debris for 10 min at
3,000 g and filtered using 0.45-µm flasks (Nalgene). Proteins were isolated using MabSelect SuRe
(GE Lifesciences) or CaptureSelect C-TagXL (Thermo-Fisher) columns according to the
manufacturers’ instructions. Eluates were buffer exchanged four times with PBS and concentrated
using Amicon ultra filtration devices (Millipore Sigma), except for S-protein-Spytag, which was
buffer exchanged by dialysis (Pierce) 3 times, and concentrated. For wtRBD-Fc and gRBD-Fc
used in mouse protein immunizations, further purification was performed by SEC on a HiPrep

16/60 Sephacryl S-400 HR column connected to an ÄKTA FPLC. Fractions were isolated with
PBS buffer, verified by SDS-PAGE gels, pooled, and concentrated. All purified proteins were
stored at 4°C prior to use.
For RBD-multimer fusion proteins, supernatant pH was adjusted to 8.5 by addition of 1/20 volume
1M Tris pH=9.0 (G-Biosciences, 786-476), and the supernatant was filtered by 0.45 μm filter prior
to purification on CaptureSelect™ C-tagXL Columns. In the case of RBD-ferritin fusions, 0.5%
Tween-20 was also added to supernatants prior to filtration, and supernatants were mixed with
anti-flag M2 agarose affinity gel (1 mL slurry for 25mL culture, Sigma-Aldrich, A2220-10ML),
and incubated on a rotary shaker overnight at 4°C. The mixture was packed into columns (Agela
Technologies, AZ-IC-1T). Columns (C-tag or M2) were washed with 10 CV TBS (25 mM Tris
8.5, 150 mM NaCl), and eluted with 5 CV Gentle Ag/Ab Elution Buffer, pH 6.6 (Thermo Scientific
Pierce, 21027). Buffer was exchanged 4 times with TBS 8.5 for yield studies, or 3 times with TBS
8.5, and one time with PBS for subsequent SEC polishing.
Protein immunizations and sera collection in rats
All animals used in these studies were handled and maintained in accordance with NIH guidelines
and approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Scripps Research
(Protocol 18-025). Female Sprague Dawley rats were immunized with incremental increasing
doses of antigen over seven days starting at day 0, and boosted with a similar regimen at day 30.
Rats were inoculated in the first set with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD fused to the Fc domain of human
IgG1, and in the second set with the RBD fused to a four amino-acid C-tag. In both cases RBD
fusions were conjugated at a 1:1 ratio to Mariculture keyhole limpet hemocyanin (mcKLH,
Thermo-Fischer Peirce) by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC,
Thermo-Fischer Peirce) according to manufactures protocols. Each set of seven injections were
performed in the following manner. RBD-KLH conjugates were administered intramuscularly into
the rear quadriceps. Inoculations were initiated with 2.2 µg RBD-KLH (equivalent to 1.1 µg RBD
antigen) adjuvanted with 0.1 µg MPLA and 0.1 µg QuilA, and this inoculum was increased by
2.55 fold for each of the next six days, administering a total of 500 µg RBD-Fc or RBD-C-tag
fusion protein, and 40 µg of each adjuvant component. Sera were collected before inoculation (day
0 preimmune sera) and every five days starting on 10th day after the first injection. All sera were
heat-inactivated for 30 minutes at 56°C and stored at -80ºC for reuse.

For the mi3 vs KLH round of inoculations, rats were inoculated with either RBD-Spytag or Sprotein-Spytag, conjugated either to equal quantities of either Spycatcher-mi3 (mixed and
incubated 4ºC overnight) or mcKLH (EDC conjugation). Incremental increasing injections were
conducted as above, but with an initial inoculation of 0.4 µg (0.2 µg each antigen and carrier) for
a total of 200 µg protein over both rounds of vaccination and 40 µg of each adjuvant component.
Protein immunizations and sera collection in mice
Female 8 to 9-week-old BALB/cJ mice were immunized with 25 µg protein antigen, 25 µg MPLA
and 10 µg of QuilA on day 0 and day 14. Sera were collected before the initial inoculation
(preimmune sera) and on day 21. All sera were heat-inactivated for 30 minutes at 56°C and stored
at -80ºC for reuse.
DNA immunizations in mice
CMV/R expression plasmids encoding wtRBD or gRBD fused to multimerization platforms
(Figure S3A) were prepared using NucleoBond® PC 2000 (Takara Bio USA Inc) and confirmed
to be essentially endotoxin free using Pierce™ Chromogenic Endotoxin Quant (Thermoscientific)
according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Female 8 to 9-week-old BALB/cJ mice were
electroporated with 60 µg DNA in each hindquarter for a total dose of 120 µg on day 0 and day
14. Electroporations were conducted on a Harvard Apparatus ECM 839 BTX in LV mode at 40V
using 8 pulses, pulse length of 100ms, at 100ms intervals with unipolar polarity. Sera were
collected before the initial inoculation (preimmune sera) and on day 21. All sera were heatinactivated for 30 minutes at 56°C and stored at -80ºC for reuse.
Neutralization studies of SARS-CoV-2 and LCMV pseudoviruses
Individual sera or pooled sera collected at day 0 (pre-immune sera), and at the indicated day after
the first inoculation were serially diluted in DMEM. In some cases, day 0 sera were mixed with
ACE2-Fc to a concentration of 10, 100, or 1000 µg/ml before dilution, and then diluted in the same
manner. Individual, pooled, or pooled-ACE2-Fc sera was mixed with SARS2-PV and incubated
at 37ºC for one hour. For rat studies, one hour later, 104 ACE2-239T cells were added along with
DEAE-Dextran (final concentration 5 µg/ml), and media was exchanged 6 hours later with fresh
media without rat sera. For mouse studies, one hour later, 104 ACE2-239T cells were added and
spun at 3000×g for 30 minutes at 4ºC, was then returned to 37ºC, and media was exchanged 2
hours later with fresh media without mouse sera. At least two independently mixed replicates

were measured for each experiment. Firefly luciferase activity was measured (Britelight) 48 hours
post-infection. All neutralization studies were performed at least twice with similar results.
Competitive displacement of ACE2-rabbit-Fc from S-protein expressing cells
Serial dilutions of pooled sera or pooled pre-immune sera mixed with ACE2-Fc (with the human
Fc domain) at initial concentrations of 10, 100 and 1000 µg/mL were then mixed with 1 µg/ml
ACE2-rabbit-Fc. Independent mixtures were made for each replicate. Pooled sera and sera
mixtures were used to stain HEK293T cells transfected by the jetPRIME Transfection Reagent
(Polyplus) to express the full-length SARS-CoV2 S protein. Specifically, 105 per cells per well
were placed in a 96-well V-bottom plate and incubated for 45 minutes at 4ºC with 100 μl of the
serially diluted sera doped with ACE2-Fc. After washing, cells were stained with anti-rabbit IgGAlexa647 antibody for 45 minutes at 4ºC, and mean fluorescence intensities were measured for
each well by flow cytometry.
Measurement of antibody-dependent enhancement
The ability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD immune sera to mediate antibody-dependent enhancement
(ADE) was measured using HEK293T cells or HEK293T cells stably expressing human ACE2
(293T-hACE2 cells), transfected using the calcium phosphate transfection method to express the
rat ortholog of FcγRI (CD64). The human monocytic cell line K562 (ATCC CCL- 243), which
endogenously expresses FcγRII, was also used for ADE assays. The RBD immune sera, collected
from four different rats at day 40 after the first immunization, were mixed at an equal ratio, as was
preimmune sera obtained at day 0 from the same rats. As a positive control, sera from ZIKVinfected rats (rat #13 and #15, distinct from the similarly numbered RBD- inoculated rats), was
also mixed at an equal ratio. Immune and pre-immune serum samples were heat inactivated for 30
min at 56°C and serially diluted in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS. SARS2-PV or
ZIKV-VLP in 50 µl was preincubated for 1 h at 37°C with 50 µl of diluted sera and added to the
indicated cells plated on the 96 well plates. Two days later, infection levels were assessed using
Luc-Pair Firefly Luciferase HS Assay Kit (Genocopia) for SARS-PV and Luc-Pair Renilla
Luciferase HS Assay Kit (Genocopia) for ZIKV-VLP.
SDS-PAGE Western Blotting
Expi293 supernatant samples were centrifuged and separated and filtered (0.45-µm). Equivalent
fractions of cell lysate and clarified supernatants were loaded and run by SDS-PAGE on

NuPAGETM bis-tris gels. Gels were then transferred to 0.4-µm PVDF membrane using Xcell Blot
Module under constant voltage of 25V for 1 hour. The membrane was wash and blocked (5%
PBST-milk 4°C), then blotted with 100 ng/mL NbSym2-rabbit-Fc, recognizing the C-tag,
previously conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (LighteningLinkTM Novus Biologicals) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
RBD-multimer proteins and particles were analyzed by blue native polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (BN-PAGE). The proteins were mixed with sample buffer and G250 loading dye
and added to a 3-12% Bis-Tris NativePAGETM gel (Life Technologies). BN-PAGE gels were run
for 2 hours at 150 V using the NativePAGETM running buffer (Life Technologies) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Native Western Blotting
Expi293 supernatant samples were centrifuged and filtered (0.45-µm). Clarified supernatants were
loaded and run by BN-PAGE. Gels were then transferred to 0.2-µm PVDF membrane using Xcell
Blot Module under constant voltage of 25V for 1 hour. The membrane was wash and blocked (5%
TBST-milk 4°C), then blotted with 50 ng/mL ACE2-Fc previously conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase (LighteningLinkTM Novus Biologicals) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Fig. 1. Immunization with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD elicits potently
neutralizing antibodies. Four female Sprague Dawley rats (R15, R16,
R17, R18) were immunized with two sets of escalating doses of RBD
conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. (A) The indicated dilutions of
preimmune sera (day 0, gray) were compared to dilutions of sera
harvested from immunized rats at day 40, and to the same dilutions
of preimmune sera mixed to achieve the indicated ACE2-Fc
concentrations before dilution. Each serum and serum-ACE2-Fc
mixture was compared for its ability to neutralize S-proteinpseudotyped retroviruses (SARS2-PV), by measuring the activity of a
firefly-luciferease reporter expressed by these pseudoviruses. Figure
shows entry of SARS2-PV as a percentage of that observed without added
rat serum. Error bars indicate the range of two neutralization studies. (B)
The data from each rat of panel A are averaged for clarity. Error bars
indicate s.d., with each rat considered a different experiment.
Differences between day-0 and day-40 serum are significant at all
dilutions (P < 0.001; two-way ANOVA). (C) Pooled sera and pooled
preimmune sera mixed with the indicated concentrations of ACE2-Fc
were further combined with an ACE2-Fc variant bearing a rabbit-derived
Fc domain. Binding of the ACE2-Fc was monitored with an antirabbit Fc secondary antibody as determined by flow cytometry.
Error bars indicate the range of two such measurements. Differences
between day-0 and day-40 serum are significant (P < 0.001; two-way
ANOVA) at all dilutions.

Fig. 2. SARS-CoV-2 RBD nanoparticles are more immunogenic
than S-protein nanoparticles. Four groups of four female Sprague
Dawley rats were inoculated with either RBD-SpyTag or S-proteinSpyTag conguated to either SpyCatcher-mi3 particles (A) by
isopeptide bond formation, or KLH (B) by EDC. The indicated
dilutions of preimmune sera (day 0) were compared to dilutions
of sera harvested from immunized rats at day 40. Each serum was
compared for its ability to neutralize S-protein-pseudotyped
retroviruses (SARS2-PV), by measuring the activity of a firefly-luciferease
reporter expressed by these pseudoviruses. Figure shows entry of
SARS2-PV as a percentage of that observed without added rat serum.
Dotted lines indicate 80% neutralization. Error bars indicate s.d. for

Fig. 4. gRBD expresses efficiently as an mi3 fusion protein and is more immunogenic than wild-type RBD as adjuvanted protein. Expression: (A) RBD-mi3 60mer fusion proteins were expressed in Expi293 cells, after 5 days, supernatants and cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE anti-CTag western blot. Note that no wtRBDmi3 could be detected in the supernatant. Immunogenicity: Five mice per group were inoculated with 25 µg of protein A/SEC purified wtRBD-Fc or gRBD-Fc adjuvanted with
25 µg of MPLA and 10 µg Quil-A. Immunizations were conducted day 0 and day 14, and serum was collected and pooled on day 21. Pooled preimmune sera, and pooled
preimmune sera doped with 200 µg/mL of ACE2-Fc were used as negative and positive controls. Pooled sera were used to neutralize (B) SARS-CoV2 pseudovirus or (C) LCMV
pseudovirus control. In parallel, HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 µg / well in a six well plate and stained the next day with pooled preimmune and day-21 sera and
then stained with either (D) anti-mouse-FITC or (E) ACE2-Fc-DyLight650. Error bars indicate SEM.

Fig. 5. gRBD based DNA vaccines more efficiently raise neutralizing antibodies than those based on wild-type
RBD. (A) Five mice per group were electroporated in each hind leg with 60 µg plasmid DNA expressing wtRBD or
gRBD fused to human Fc dimer, foldon trimer, H. pylori NAP 12-mer, H. pylori ferritin 24-mer, and mi3 60mer. An additional control group was electroporated with plasmid expressing the full-length SARSCoV-2 spike protein with two stabilizing prolines (S1273-PP). Electroporations were conducted day 0 and
day 14, and serum was collected and pooled for neutralization assays on day 21. Pooled preimmune
sera, and pooled preimmune sera doped with 200 µg/mL of ACE2-Fc were used as negative and positive
controls. (B) Neutralizing potency of gRBD varied by platform. (C) IC50 calculations for wtRBD and gRBD
were calculated (Prism 8) against normalized values by least squares fit. P-value was calculated by 2tailed paired t test between wtRBD and gRBD pairs.

Fig. S1. Anti-RBD antisera does not mediate antibody-dependent enhancement
of SARSCoV-2 S protein-mediated entry. (A) HEK293T cells were transfected to
express rat FcγRI and infected with SARS2-PV in the presence of the indicated
dilutions of preimmune day 0 or immune day 40 antisera. (B) Experiments similar to
those in panel A except that ZIKV VLP and anti-ZIKV antisera, also elicited in Sprague
Dawley rats, were compared to preimmune sera. (C, D) Experiments identical to those
in panel A and B respectively except that HEK239T cells stably expressing human
ACE2 were again transfected to express rat FcγRI before incubation with SARS2-PV (C)
or ZIKV-VLP (D). (E, F) Experiments identical to A and B, respectively, except that the
pro-monocytic K562 cell line was incubated with SARS2-PV (E) or ZIKV-VLP (F). Error
bars in panels A-F indicate the range of two experiments run in parallel. Significant
differences with day-0 preimmune sera are indicated (**** indicates P<0.001 by twoway ANOVA; ns indicates not significant).

as
fusions to the C-terminus of H. pylori NAP 12-mer. Native western
blots probed with
ACE2-Fc-HRP were performed
on Expi293
supernatants harvested 5 days post transfection.

ACE2-Fc-DyLight650

Fig. S4. Multivalent gRBD fusion proteins express more
efficiently than their wtRBD counterparts. (A) Complete
sequences of the multivalent gRBD fusion constructs used in these
studies. Green indicated signal peptide; black, linker residues; blue,
multivalent carrier protein; red, gRBD; purple, affinity tag. (B) Yields
of purified wtRBD and gRBD multimers expressed from the CMV/R
vector in Expi293 cells. Values reflect a minimum of two
independent transfections. Error bars indicate s.d. (C) Flow
cytometery of 293T cells transiently transfected with SARS-CoV2 S
protein in the pCAGGS vector, or S1273-PP in the CMVR vector.
Expression was measured by by staining with ACE2-Fc-DyLight650.
Right panel indicates mean fluorescence intensity as determine from
the histogram shown in the left panel.
