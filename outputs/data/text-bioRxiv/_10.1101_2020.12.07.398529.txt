Summary

Zoonotic infections, such as COVID-19, reside in animal hosts before jumping species to
humans. The Carnivora, like mink, carry many zoonoses yet how diversity in host immune genes
across species impact upon pathogen carriage are poorly understood. Here we describe a
progressive evolutionary downregulation of pathogen sensing inflammasome pathways in
Carnivora. This includes the loss of nucleotide-oligomerisation domain leucine rich repeat
receptors (NLRs), acquisition of a unique caspase-1/-4 effector fusion protein that processes
gasdermin D pore formation without inducing lytic cell death and the formation of an NLRP3caspase-8 containing inflammasome that inefficiently processes interleukin-1β (IL-1β).
Inflammasomes regulate gut immunity, but the carnivorous diet is antimicrobial suggesting a
tolerance to the loss of these immune pathways. The consequences of systemic inflammasome
downregulation, however, can reduce the host sensing of specific pathogens such that they can
reside undetected in the Carnivora.

Introduction
Viral and bacterial zoonotic pathogens, such as COVID-19 and Salmonella species, infect
asymptomatic or symptomatic animal hosts which facilitate the transmission to humans. Pathogen
genomics has yielded important discoveries about the diversity of different microorganisms in the
context of disease (Weinert et al., 2015). Comparative biology of animal immune systems and
their links to infection susceptibility are less well understood. This is partly due to a lack of tools,
for example antibodies or other resources that make immune studies tractable, but the use of
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing is a universal technique that can be applied to cells from many animals.
Approximately 49% of all carnivore species (for example mink and dogs), the highest proportion
of any mammal order including bats, carry one or more unique zoonotic pathogens (Han et al.,
2016). Whether this is because Carnivora are a large group of animals harbouring many pathogens
so carry proportionally more zoonoses (Mollentze and Streicker, 2020) or due to other factors such
as differences in the immune system remains to be determined.

Inflammasomes are of central importance in host protection against viral and bacterial diseases
driving inflammation to control infections in humans and mice (Broz and Dixit, 2016). Canonical
inflammasomes are a multi-protein complex composed of a pathogen recognition receptor, such as
a nucleotide-oligomerisation domain leucine rich repeat receptors (NLRs; NLRP1, NLRP3 and
NLRC4), Pyrin or absent-in-melanoma 2 receptor (AIM2), an adaptor (apoptosis associated speck
like protein, ASC) and an effector protein (caspase-1; CASP1). The role of this pro-inflammatory
protein complex is to process the immature cytokines pro-interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and pro-IL-18
into their mature, more active forms and to cleave the lytic pyroptotic cell death effector gasdermin
D to its pore forming N-terminal fragment (Broz and Dixit, 2016). Non-canonical inflammasomes
can also be formed by cytosolic delivery of the bacterial toxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which
leads to the activation of caspase-11 in mice or caspase-4 and -5 in humans to cleave gasdermin

D, which in turn leads to the activation of NLRP3 (Broz and Dixit, 2016; Broz et al., 2020;
Lieberman et al., 2019). There is wide species diversity in AIM-2 like receptors, but there is
substantial functional redundancy which acts as a compensatory mechanism (Brunette et al.,
2012).

Here by comparing the distribution and evolution of inflammasome and cell death genes across
the order Carnivora we find a profound compromise in inflammasome functionality, caspasedependent lytic cell death pathways and a critical loss of NLR genes. A caspase-1-caspase-4
fusion protein found in all Carnivora despite being functionally capable of processing substrates
in vitro and being active in mouse cells is inactive in cells from a model carnivore (dog). Caspase8 is conserved and processes some pro-IL-1b, but without inducing lytic cell death and is
predominantly required for upregulating expression of this protein.

This compromised

inflammasome activity coupled to the absence of the necroptotic effector Mixed Lineage Kinase
Domain Like Pseudokinase (MLKL) (Dondelinger et al., 2016) should mean that the order
Carnivora are immunologically challenged particularly in gut mucosal immunity, but ecology
studies suggest that a high protein diet, such as that consumed by carnivores, is antimicrobial.
This may explain why these innate immune pathways have been lost in the Carnivora, but the
consequences for the carriage of zoonotic pathogens, particularly in organs other than the gut, may
be very detrimental.

Results
The Carnivora caspase-1/-4 fusion has limited activity within cells compared to the
recombinant protein and when an equivalent mouse caspase-1/-11 is expressed within mouse
cells.
Carnivora, such as dogs, cats and mink, through their close proximity with humans, can be
susceptible to human pathogens.

There are, however, marked differences in Carnivora

inflammasome effector caspases compared to humans and also to mice. A unique caspase-1/-4
fusion protein is present in all cats and dogs (Eckhart et al., 2008). This protein has the equivalent
of the CARD1 domain of caspase-1, which should render it unable to respond to cytosolic LPS,
and the catalytic domain is most closely related to the catalytic domain of mouse caspase-11
(caspase 4 or 5 in humans), being only distantly related to caspase-1 in terms of sequence identity
(Fig S1). This caspase-1/-4 fusion is conserved across all Carnivora (Fig 1A). The absence of
individual caspase-1 and caspase-4/-5/-11 genes in Carnivora suggests there will be differences in
how inflammasomes function in species of this order. The structural differences in the caspase1/-4 fusion (Fig S1) suggests it should be able to process gasdermin D in response to canonical
inflammasome stimulation, but have a limited/no capacity to process IL-1β and IL-18. To
characterise inflammasome functionality in Carnivora we first took immortalised bone marrow
derived macrophages from wild type (WT) mice and compared them to the DH82 dog macrophagelike cell line as a Carnivora model.

Cells were infected with Salmonella enterica serovar

Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) which activates NLRC4 and NLRP3 canonical inflammasome
formation (Man et al., 2014). IL-1β was produced by the WT mouse cells, as expected, and also,
surprisingly, the dog cells which showed clear, but inefficient, processing of pro- IL-1β (Fig 1B).
Cells from WT mice, caspase-1/-11 double knock out mice and the DH82 dog cells infected with
S. Typhimurium showed that the majority of cells from the WT mice, as expected, released LDH
so lysed 2 hours post infection and cells from the caspase-1/-11 double knock out do not lyse until

24 hours post infection. The dog macrophage cells, surprisingly, did not lyse until 24 hours post
infection (Fig 1B). Experiments in primary monocyte derived macrophages isolated from dog
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with S. Typhimurium also induced IL-1β
production with delayed lytic cell death (Fig 1C). This is unexpected given the caspase-1/-4 fusion
was expected to process gasdermin D to lyse cells, but not cleave IL-1β in response to canonical
inflammasome activity (Kayagaki et al., 2011).

Caspase 1 and caspase 11 are so close to each other in the mouse genome (Kayagaki et al., 2011)
that it is theoretically possible to delete the catalytic domain of caspase 1 and the CARD domains
of caspase 11 to make a mouse fusion protein equivalent to the Carnivora caspase-1/-4 fusion. To
determine the biological functions of the caspase-1/-4 fusion we therefore used a novel approach
of CRISPR/Cas9 gene deletion (S2) to generate a mouse with a fusion protein of the caspase-1
CARD1 and the caspase-11 catalytic domain (DogMo; (Fig S3).

Bone marrow derived

macrophages from DogMo infected with S. Typhimurium, as expected, showed canonical
inflammasome driven cell lysis and gasdermin D processing, but no IL-1β production (Fig 1D, E).
DogMo cells also showed no cell lysis or IL-1β production in response to non-canonical
inflammasome activation induced by cytosolic LPS (Fig 1F).

DH82 dog cells and primary dog

mononuclear cells, in contrast, showed no cell lysis and limited IL-1β production in response to
cytosolic LPS (Fig 1F, G, S4). The IL-1β produced by the DH82 cells was the same whether the
cells were stimulated with the TLR2 ligand Pam3CSK4 (as a control) or after transfection of LPS
into the cytosol after priming with Pam3CSK4 suggesting this cytokine was induced by priming
rather than non-canonical inflammasome activation (Fig 1F, G, H). To determine whether the
enzymatic properties of the caspase-1/-4 hybrid could account for the IL-1β processing in the
absence of lytic cell death by inflammasomes in dog cells, we expressed the catalytic domain of
this protein to test its ability to process substrates in vitro (Fig 1I). Caspase-1/-4 processed both

gasdermin D and IL-1β to their biologically active forms in vitro. Caspase-11, as expected, cleaved
gasdermin D but not IL-1β. We also used synthetic peptidyl substrates optimized, based on
specificity screens, to improve selectivity for caspase-1 or caspase-11 (Ramirez et al., 2018). Dog
caspase-1/-4 cleaved these synthetic substrates at superior rates compared to caspase-11 and
cleaved the caspase-1 optimum substrate at rates comparable to caspase-1 (Fig 1I). These data
reveal that the substrate specificity of dog caspase-1/-4 resembles that of caspase-1 more closely
than caspase-11 in vitro.

This suggests that the defective canonical and non canonical

inflammasome responses in dog cells are not caused by an intrinsic loss of enzymatic activity of
the caspase-1/-4 fusion protein, but most likely because of an alternative regulatory mechanism.

The inflammasome gene repertoire and functionality in the Carnivora is severely
compromised.
An alternative explanation for our data is that species-specific differences in NLRs might account
for the weak activation of canonical inflammasomes we see in dog cells. AIM2, for example, is
absent in many species including Carnivora (Brunette et al., 2012). Analysis of the repertoire of
NLR genes across the Carnivora identified that either NLR family of apoptosis inhibitory proteins
(NAIP) and/or NLRC4 (bacterial sensors) are predominantly missing or are pseudogenes in the
Canidae whereas the Felidae lack another bacterial sensor NLRP1 (Fig 2A). The loss of these
NLRs occurred early in the evolutionary trees of both the Canidae and Felidae (Fig 2B). This
diversity in NLRs suggests that the lack of NAIP/NLRC4 in dogs would, at least partially, explain
the altered inflammasome responses to S. Typhimurium, which activates both NLRC4 and
NLRP3, we saw when comparing mouse and dog macrophages. NLRP3, a non-specific sensor of
cellular insults (Swanson et al., 2019), in contrast, is conserved across all Carnivora. We next
stimulated WT mouse, caspase-1/-11 double knock out mouse or dog DH82 macrophages with
increasing concentrations of the canonical NLRP3 activator nigericin. We saw cell lysis in WT

mouse BMMs, as expected, but no cell lysis in dog cells until we used very high concentrations
of nigericin when cell death was independent of both caspase-1 and -11 in mouse BMMs (Fig
2C). The failure of nigericin to induce inflammasome-induced cell lysis was not due to the
inability of the caspase fusion protein to function per se because stimulation of the DogMo
macrophages again showed cell lysis and gasdermin D cleavage, but minimal IL-1β production
(Fig 2D, E).

How then is NLRP3 processing IL-1β, but not driving cell lysis? Caspase-8 can be recruited to
the inflammasome to process IL-1β and gasdermin D, particularly in the absence of caspase-1
(Lee et al., 2018; Man et al., 2013; Newton et al., 2019). In experiments where we visualised
NLRP3 induction of ASC specks we saw recruitment of a caspase-8 fluorescent substrate to this
macromolecular structure within dog cells (Fig 2F). To validate this observation, we used
CRISPR/Cas9 to delete caspase-8 from dog macrophages (S5) and saw a loss of IL-1β production
in response to S. Typhimurium (Fig 2G). This suggests canonical inflammasome formation in dog
macrophages utilises caspase-8, rather than the caspase-1-4 fusion, to weakly process IL-1β (Fig
2I), but lytic cell death is not initiated. We also used a caspase-1 fluorescent substrate and
visualised the caspase-1/-4 fusion recruited to the ASC speck (Fig 2F), but deletion of this gene
fusion by CRISPR/Cas9 did not alter IL-1β production by DH82 cells following cellular infection
with S. Typhimurium (S5). Caspase-8 regulates the Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein
kinase 1 (RIPK1)/RIPK3 pathway that triggers necroptosis, but also regulates Toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4)-dependent Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κβ) driven
transcription of genes such as pro-IL1β. Carnivora cells cannot undergo necroptosis as the effector
protein Mixed Lineage Kinase Domain Like Pseudokinase (MLKL) is missing from their genomes
(Dondelinger et al., 2016). When we used CRISPR/Cas9 to remove RIPK1 from dog cells IL-1β
production was abolished in response to inflammasome stimulation (Fig 2H, I) because of a loss

of pro-IL-1β transcription driven by TLR4 priming from the Salmonella LPS. Collectively our
data suggest that what little inflammasome cytokine processing occurs in carnivores is driven by
caspase- 8.

Inflammasome activity induces pore formation, but is uncoupled from cell lysis in the
Carnivora.
Our data suggest that in dogs and, presumably in other Carnivora, non-canonical inflammasome
activation is absent and canonical inflammasome activation is limited to a little caspase-8dependent processing of IL-1β without lytic cell death. In Carnivora there is a loss of, or
modification of, genes important in lytic cell death pathways (necroptosis and pyroptosis Figure 3
A, E). Gasdermin D pores can form, however, without inducing lytic cell death (Evavold et al.,
2018) so as there are no gasdermin D antibodies that cross react with the dog protein we measured
propridium iodide (PI) uptake and used live cell imaging of DH82 cells to determine if pyroptotic
cell death pathways are completely missing in dog cells. S. Typhimurium classically processes
gasdermin D to induce rapid lytic cell death in mouse or human cells, yet infected dog cells took
up PI, but only lysed 24 hours post infection presumably when the cell membrane can no longer
contain the enormous intracellular bacterial load (Fig 3 B, C). In response to nigericin stimulation
DH82 cells again took up PI suggesting gasdermin D pores are formed, but cells from these animals
have a markedly reduced capacity for pro-inflammatory lytic cell death (Fig 3 B, D). The
appearance of the caspase-1/-4 fusion and the loss of MLKL occurred early in the Carnivora
evolutionary tree (Fig 2B). Gasdermin E, a protein that drives pyroptosis in response to caspase3 activation (Wang et al., 2017), is conserved. The apoptotic caspases 3, 7, 8 and 9 are fully
conserved across all Carnivora suggesting caspase-dependent cell death may be limited primarily
to apoptosis pathways in these animals (Fig 3A). We do see some lytic cell death at very high
doses of nigericin in dog cells (Fig 3C) which could be driven by, for example, gasdermin E, but

Discussion

Here we show that key inflammasome lytic cell death pathways thought to be critical for gut health
in mammals are either genetically and/or functionally missing from the Carnivora. PI uptake
without cell lysis occurs in dog cells in response to inflammasome activation suggesting a
dissociation of gasdermin D pore formation from lytic cell death similar to the phenotype seen if
the NINJ1 protein is deleted from human or mouse cells (Kayagaki et al., 2020) yet all Carnivora
have NINJ1. Our data suggest that inefficient inflammasome activation occurs in dog cells such
that insufficient gasdermin D pores form to drive cell lysis. Inflammasome-driven lytic cell death
is, therefore, lost in Canidae and this is particularly interesting because the Carnivora also lack the
necroptotic effector MLKL such that two of the critical inflammatory cell death pathways that are
thought to be essential for host protection against infection are absent. One of the key functions
for inflammatory cell death is to protect the gut against infection (Crowley et al., 2020; Rauch et
al., 2017; Schwarzer et al., 2020; Sellin et al., 2014; Tummers et al., 2020) yet canonical
inflammasome, non-canonical inflammasome and necroptotic lytic cell death pathways in
Carnivora are inactive. Emerging ecological evidence suggests that a high protein diet, such as
that consumed by the Carnivora, is antimicrobial (Cotter et al., 2019) and we speculate that the
evolutionary and functional reduction in inflammasome activation in the Carnivora may simply
reflect the protection against infection conferred on these animals by their dietary habits.

Canonical inflammasomes traditionally couple a receptor, such as an NLR or AIM2, with ASC
and the effector protein caspase-1 whereas non canonical inflammasomes are driven by caspase 4/-5/-11 to indirectly activate NLRP3 (Broz and Dixit, 2016). In the Carnivora caspase-1 and -4
are fused into a single caspase which has the CARD domain of caspase-1 but the catalytic site of
caspase-4/-11 which should result in a protein that is unable to bind to LPS, efficiently processes

gasdermin D, but cannot process pro-IL-1b. Macrophages from a mouse expressing an analogous
caspase-1/-11 fusion fulfilled these predictions, although when expressed as a recombinant protein
the dog caspase-1/-4 can process both gasdermin D and pro-IL-1b in vitro.

In the dog

macrophages, however, the caspase-1/-4 fusion is relative inactive producing no lytic cell death,
limited gasdermin D pore formation and what little pro-IL-1b processing occurs is through
caspase-8. This caspase can be recruited to canonical inflammasomes, particularly in the absence
of caspase-1, to process pro-IL-1b and drive cell death (Man et al., 2013; Newton et al., 2019).
Our data shows that the predominant role for caspase-8 in the Carnivora, however, is to drive proIL-1b expression. IL-1b is active in domestic members of the Carnivora, like dogs (Dinarello,
2018), so presumably inflammasome independent mechanisms, such as through proteinase-3,
elastase, matrix metalloprotease-9 and granzyme A (Dinarello, 2018), process sufficient pro-IL1b to provide immune protection in these animals.

There are potential consequences for the loss of the inflammasome and cell death pathways
particularly in organ systems other than the gut. The presence of bacteria in other organs of the
Carnivora might be expected to lead to either immune deficits and/or allow the pathogen to hide.
Inflammasome-induced pyroptosis and subsequent lytic cell death is thought to be a critically
important mechanism by which pathogens are controlled in the host (Martinon et al., 2009; Miao
et al., 2010). The lack of pyroptotic cell lysis in the Carnivora should, therefore, severely
compromise the susceptibility of these animals to infection, yet these mammals continue to thrive.
The Canidae lack of NAIP/NLRC4 should affect the recognition of a number of bacterial
pathogens including salmonellae, Pseudomonas and Bacillus. The Felidae lack of NLRP1, which
is activated by protease cleavage and thus susceptible to processing by bacterial or viral proteases
(Chui et al., 2019; Sandstrom et al., 2019), potentially compromises the immune status of these
animals in response to pathogens. The Carnivora also have a minimal capacity to activate NLRP3.

The compromise in inflammasome functionality in the Carnivora does not seem to predispose
them to infection, but another possible consequence of the lack of PRR recognition could be to
allow pathogens to reside undetected facilitating the potential for zoonotic carriage. One reason
for the high zoonotic carriage by bats has been suggested to be due to dampened activation of
NLRP3 (Ahn et al., 2019). The muted inflammasome activation we see in Canidae might also
facilitate zoonotic carriage. COVID-19, for example, is carried by mink (Oude Munnink et al.,
2020) and although its genome is incomplete the caspase 1 locus is intact with, as expected, a
predicted caspase-1/-4 fusion protein consistent with poor inflammasome functionality. The loss
of these immune pathways in Carnivora may, therefore, have the unexpected consequence of
permitting certain pathogens to evade host detection when in habitats other than the gut thus
facilitating the carriage of zoonotic infections.

DH82, (D) primary murine WT, DogMo and immortalised canine DH82 cells were primed with
LPS (200 ng/ml for 3 hours) then stimulated with nigericin (20-200 µM for 1 hour). Percentage of
cell lysis (Ci, Di) was determined by measuring the relative amount of LDH release into the
supernatant, while IL-1β release (Cii, Dii) was measured using murine- and canine-specific
ELISA kits, respectively. (Ciii) Immortalised DH82, (E) primary WT and DogMo cells were

Carnivora gene presence/absence analysis
Genomes of the Carnivora species listed on the Ensembl genome database were examined for the
presence of key innate immune system and cell death genes. Genes were first assessed for presence
using the standard Ensembl annotation tool. For genes that were absent, we extracted the closest
evolutionary relative’s cDNA splice variants (or the human cDNA variants if no relatives could be
found in Carnivora) and performed Blastn (http://www.ensembl.org/Multi/Tools/Blast) on release
98 of the Ensembl genome database. In some cases, the gene was found but not appropriately
annotated. Standard checks were performed to confirm that the gene was a true orthologue of the gene
in question. These included 1) producing a bootstrapped neighbour-joining phylogeny and confirming
that the gene tree was consistent with the species phylogeny and 2) checking that the gene length was
consistent with not containing premature stop codons. The phylogenetic tree was produced in RStudio
(v1.2.5001) using the ‘ape’ and ‘seqinr’ packages. The function ‘dist.dna(x, model=”F84”)’ first
produced a matrix of pairwise distances from the DNA, ‘nj()’ constructed a tree from this distance
matrix and bootstrapping of the tree was carried out using the function ‘boot.phylo()’. A bootstrap
value of >80% was taken as support for a particular node. Genes may be missing from genomes due
to errors in genome assembly. To verify that genes not found by annotation and Blastn were due to
true absence, synteny between the genomes was examined. A queried species genome and the most
closely related species genome available containing the investigated gene were compared. The gene
coordinates were retrieved from the “Region in detail” tool on Ensembl’s gene location option, this
allowed the gene size, location and relation to nearby genes to be obtained. Using this information,
synteny maps were generated for species in which the gene is thought to be deleted.

Cell culture
Murine immortalised bone marrow derived macrophages (iBMDMs) and canine DH82 cells were
maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing- 10% FBS, 5 mM Lglutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml of penicillin at 37°C, 5% CO2. Primary BMDMs
were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS, 8 mM L-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and
100 units/ml penicillin, 20% L929 conditioned medium for 6 days before use. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were taken from residual blood samples from dogs admitted to the
Queen’s Veterinary School Hospital (Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge)
and pooled (Table S1). Mononuclear cells were isolated using Histopaque-1077 density gradient
medium (Sigma) and SepMate™ mononuclear cell tubes (Stem Cell Technologies). For bacterial
infection studies, cell cultures and bacteria were prepared complete medium without antibiotics
(DMEM-).
Cells were seeded in 96-well flat-bottomed plates at a concentration of 1x106/ml in DMEM- and
incubated overnight at 37°C in 5% CO2. S. Typhimurium SL1344 was grown for 18h before subculturing to logarithmic growth for 3h as described [1]. Cells were infected with S. Typhimurium
SL1344 for 1 hour with multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1, 10 or 50. For long time courses (over 2
hours) cell culture medium was replaced with DMEM- cell culture medium supplemented with
gentamicin (ThermoFisherScientific) at 50 μg/ml final concentration and further incubated for one
hour at 37°C in 5% CO2. For the 6- and 24-hour time-points, 50 μg/ml gentamicin was replaced with
fresh DMEM- cell culture medium containing gentamicin at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. At each
time point the supernatant was removed and stored at -80°C until required. In time lapse experiments
medium was not replaced to ensure that the field of vision was retained.
Inflammasome activators and inhibitors
Cells were seeded at 1x106 cells/ml and incubated overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2. Adherent cells were
primed with either ultrapure E.coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (InvivoGen, tlrl-3pelps) at a final

concentration of 200 ng/ml for 3 hours or Pam3CSK4 (Pam3) (InvivoGen, tlrl-pms) at a final
concentration of 10 μg/ml for 4 hours at 37°C, 5% CO2. Cells were stimulated with nigericin (SigmaAldrich, N7143-5MG; 10 μM to 200 μM) for 1 hour. For non-canonical inflammasome activation,
cells were incubated with ultrapure LPS at 1 μg/ml or 5 μg/ml final concentration in the presence of
FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega, E2311) for 16 hours at 37°C, 5% CO2. LPS and
transfection reagent were pre-incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature prior to addition to the
cells.
Genome editing
The crRNA designs were performed using Benchling online research platform (https://benchling.com)
and crRNA sequences were confirmed using IDT’s Custom Alt-R® CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA tool
(https://eu.idtdna.com/site/order/designtool/index/CRISPR_CUSTOM). Equimolar amounts of tracrand crRNAs (IDT) were mixed and heated at 95˚C for 5 minutes. Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assembly
reaction was performed on duplexes by adding an equimolar concentration of Cas9 endonuclease
protein (IDT) to the complex. The RNP complex was then supplemented with equimolar concentration
of Alt-R® Cas9 electroporation enhancer (IDT). DH82 cells were resuspended in Nucleofector
Solution V containing electroporation supplement (Lonza, VCA- 1003) and 10 μl of RNP was
introduced. The nucleofection buffer-cell-RNP mix was then transferred directly into an
electroporation cuvette and a single electroporation was performed in an Amaxa Nucleofector 2b
(Lonza) using the X-005 program. Cells were rested for 48 hours, after which they were seeded into
96 well plates at single-cell dilution to obtain single cell clones. Monoclones were genotyped as
previously described (PMID: 26443227). Briefly, locus-specific primers were designed based on the
canine reference genome (CanFam3.1) using Primer-blast and were designed to incorporate 5’ adaptor
sequences. First level PCR was performed using genomic DNA extracted from monoclones and the
locus-specific primers. Second level MiSeq PCRs were performed using the first round PCR product
as template and the universal 96-well Miseq barcode primers, prepared by combining 8 unique forward

were prepared for immunoblotting by incubating the appropriate volume of sample with Pierce™ Lane
Marker (5x) Reducing Sample Buffer (Thermo Fisher) for 10 minutes at 100°C. After denaturation
lysates were cooled on ice followed by brief centrifugation and subjected to SDS-PAGE.
Total protein extraction from cell culture supernatants
Total protein was extracted from clarified supernatants using methanol/chloroform extraction method.
Samples were then centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 12 minutes at 4°C. The intermediate phase containing
the precipitated protein was carefully aspirated and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4°C. Protein pellets
were washed twice in ice-cold methanol. In between washes the resuspended pellets were centrifuged
at 16,000 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C. After the final wash, the methanol was carefully removed, and the
pellets were allowed to dry. Pellets were re-suspended in Laemmli 2 x concentrate sample buffer
(Sigma Aldrich), heated at 100°C for 10 minutes and stored at -80°C until required.

Western blotting
Denatured proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 12% tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels and
subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes followed by incubation with primary (anti-ASC
#AG-25B-006-C100, anti-canine IL-1β AF3747, anti-caspase-1 p10 sc-514, anti-caspase-11 sc-56038
or anti-GSDMD ab209845) and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Proteins were detected using
Western Lightning Plus-ECL Substrate (Perkin Elmer, NEL103E001EA) and protein bands were
visualised using a GeneGnome chemiluminescence imager (Syngene, GeneGnome XRQ).
LDH release quantification
Supernatants were assayed for LDH release at indicated time points using the CytoTox 96® NonRadioactive Cytotoxicity Assay kit (Promega, G1780) per the manufacturer’s instruction. Absorbance
values (absorbance 490 nm and 680 nm) were measured on either a PHERAstar or CLARIOstar
Microplate Reader (both BMG Labtech). Percentage cell death values are expressed relative to total
LDH release induced by detergent lysis.
Propidium iodide uptake
DH82 were seeded into 96-well black/clear bottom microplates at 5 x 104 cells/well in complete
DMEM and incubated overnight. Cells were either unprimed or primed with 200 ng/ml LPS for 3
hours prior to stimulation with 100 µM nigericin. Cells were infected with Salmonella at the indicated
MOIs in imaging medium (Opti-MEM containing GlutaMax, HEPES and 10% FBS). Propidium
iodide (PI) was used at a final concentration of 2 µg/ml. Triton X-100 (0.2% w/v) in imaging medium
was added to control wells. Measurements were taken every 10 minutes on a CLARIOstar microplate
reader set to 37 °C. After the first kinetic window (1 hour), the plate was removed and 100 µM nigericin
added to the LPS-primed wells, or in the Salmonella-infected wells, the medium was replaced with
imaging medium supplemented with 50 µg/ml gentamicin, and fluorescence readings recorded every
10 minutes for a further 23 hours. The percentage PI uptake was normalised against the unstimulated

fluorescence recordings at the start of each kinetic window (0%) and the maximal PI uptake (100 %)
induced by Triton X-100 (0.2 %).
Cytokine measurement using ELISA
Mouse IL-1β and canine IL-1β released into cell culture supernatant was measured using Mouse IL1β ELIOptEIA™ (BD Biosciences, 559603) and Canine IL-1β/IL-1F2 DuoSet (R&D Systems,
DY3747) respectively, as described in the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance was read at 450
nm wavelength (570 nm correction) using either a PHERAstar or CLARIOstar Microplate Reader
(BMG, Labtech).
Sample preparation for immunofluorescent staining and imaging
Murine and canine iBMDMs and primary macrophages were seeded at a density of 2x105 cells/well
on an 8-well chamber slide (ThermoFisher) and incubated overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2. Following
ligand stimulation, cells were incubated with either FAM FLICA caspase-1, caspase-8or poly-caspase
(all Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Post stimulation, cells were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 28908) and incubated with anti-ASC (AL177)
pAb (Adipogen, AG-25B-0006-C100) followed by incubation with goat-anti-rabbit-IgGAlexaFluor488 (Invitrogen, A11034) or -AlexaFluor568 (Invitrogen, A11036) secondary antibodies.
Cells were counterstained with nuclear Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, H3570) labelling solution followed
by mounting in VECTASHIELD Antifade Mounting Medium (H-1000, Vector) and imaged using an
Inverted Fluorescence Microscope (Leica DM IRM).
Recombinant protein expression and in vitro caspase activity assays
Constructs encoding mouse pro-IL-1β, as well as CARD deleted modified versions of caspase-1 and
caspase-11 in pET29b(+) containing a C-terminal 6×His tag were previously described[2]. The DNA
encoding the CARD deleted version of dog caspase-1/-4 containing a C-terminal 6×His tag was
purchased from Integrated DNA technologies (IDT, San Diego, CA) and cloned into pET29b(+) by
using Nde I and Xho I. Gasdermin D sequence was amplified

from a pET29b(+) construct using primers to add an N-term 8xHis and cloned into pET15b using Nde
I and Xho I restriction enzymes. Proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli cultures and purified
as previously described (Ramirez et al., 2018). Protein concentration of pro-IL-1β and gasdermin D
was calculated by absorbance at 280 nm and the concentration of caspases was calculated by active
site titration with z-VAD-fmk. Activity assays were performed in 100 μl final volume and assay buffer
consisted of 20 mM PIPES, 10% sucrose, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT
and 0.75 M sodium citrate. The fluorogenic peptide substrates Ac-Trp-Thr(Bzl)-His-Asp-ACC and
Ac-Tle-Bpa-His(Bzl)-Asp-ACC and Ac-WEHD-AFC was purchased from BACHEM. For kcat/KM
determination, the concentration of fluorogenic peptide substrates varied in the range of 5-200 μM.
Reactions were monitored for 30 minutes at 37°C in a CLARIOstar plate reader (BMG LabTech). The
ACC fluorophore was detected at excitation/emission 355/460 nm and AFC at 400/505 nm. Reaction
velocity was calculated using MARS data analysis software (BMG LabTech) and the kinetic
parameters with Prism 7 (GraphPad) using the Michaelis-Menten equation. Recombinant
inflammatory caspases were subjected to 2-fold dilution series and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C
with 4 μM gasdermin D or pro-IL1β. Reactions in a 60 μl final volume were performed using assay
buffer minus sodium citrate. After incubation, reactions were terminated by the addition of 30 μl of 3
× SDS loading buffer and heated at 95°C for 5 minutes. Reaction products were separated on 4-12%
Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels and stained with Instant Blue (Expedeon).
Generation of a mouse with a Casp1-Casp4 gene fusion
To generate a mouse allele corresponding to the dog caspase gene fusion, a CRISPR strategy with two
sgRNAs was used to generate a 20,524 bp deletion (GRCm38/mm10 chr9:5,302,869-5,323,392). The
5' sgRNA (binding to chr9:5,302,865-5,302,884 reverse strand) is located in Casp1 intron 4 and the 3'
sgRNA (binding to chr9:5,323,374-5,323,393) is located in Casp4 intron 3. The deletion thus created
an in-frame fusion between Casp1 exons 1-4 and Casp4 exons 4-9, resulting in a fusion protein similar
to the dog fusion protein (see protein alignment). Cas9 mRNA and synthetic sgRNAs (Synthego) were

co-microinjected into C57BL/6N mouse zygotes and resulting mosaic founders positive for the large
deletion were analysed for absence of off-targets essentially as described and subsequently bred to
C57BL/6N for transmission of the fusion allele. Homozygous mice were used in this study (Anderson
et al., 2018; Sievers et al., 2011).

Figure S1: The dog caspase-1/-4 hybrid (A, B) Domain organisation of the dog
caspase- 1/4/11 hybrid protein. The gene encoding the canine hybrid protein can produce
two alternative transcripts. (Transcript A) The larger transcript contains two tandem
CARDs and a caspase domain. The first CARD domain shows high sequence homology to
the CARD domain of human and murine caspase-1. While the second CARD domain
shows high sequence similarities to the CARD domain of human caspase-4/-5 and murine
caspase-11. The caspase domain shows high similarities to the caspase domain of human
caspase-4/-5 and murine caspase-11. (Transcript B) By contrast, the shorter transcript
excludes the second CARD domain, resulting in a gene sequence consisting of a CARD
domain similar to human and murine caspase-1 and the caspase domain similar to human
caspase-4/-5 and murine caspase-11. (C) Ensembl gene build annotation of the hybrid gene
(ENSCAFG00000014860) shows the predicted protein coding exons. The identified
catalytic residue is present in both transcripts in exon 6. Mass spectrometry analysis of full
protein extracts from (D(i)) non-stimulated (medium only) and (ii) LPS primed DH82 cell
lysates were cut out between the 32 kDa and 58 kDa molecular weight markers (area
marked with red rectangles) and prepared for mass spectrometry analysis by the Cambridge
Centre for Proteomics (CCP) Core Facility. (iii) Mass spectrometry analysis showed
constitutive expression of the hybrid gene.
S2 Strategy for the generation of the DogMo mouse. (A) To generate a mouse allele
corresponding to the dog caspase gene fusion, a CRISPR strategy with two sgRNAs was
used to generate a 20,524 bp deletion (GRCm38/mm10 chr9:5,302,869-5,323,392). The 5'
sgRNA (binding to chr9:5,302,865-5,302,884 reverse strand) is located in Casp1 intron 4
and the 3' sgRNA (binding to chr9:5,323,374-5,323,393) is located in Casp4 intron 3. (B)
The deletion thus created an in-frame fusion between Casp1 exons 1-4 and Casp4 exons 49, resulting in a fusion protein similar to the dog fusion protein.

Immortalised murine WT, CASP1-/-CASP11-/- and canine DH82 cells were primed with
Pam3CSK4 (10 μg/ml for 4 hours) then stimulated with either LPS (5 μg/ml) alone or in
conjunction with FuGENEâHD transfection reagent. Percentage of cell lysis induced was
determined by measuring LDH release into the supernatant, while IL-1β release was
measured using ELISA method. Data shown is pooled from three independent experiments.
Error bars represent the standard error of means (SEM) of triplicate wells.
S4 CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of the caspase-1/-4 from DH82 does not affect IL-1β
production in response to inflammasome stimulation by STm infection. Caspase-1/-4
knock-out clones A1, C6, non-electroporated and electroporated wild-type DH82 cells
were infected with S. Typhimurium at MOI of 10. (A) Percentage of cell lysis induced was
determined by measuring the relative amount of LDH release into the supernatant, while
(B) IL-1β release was measured using ELISA method. Data shown is pooled from three
independent experiments. Error bars represent the standard error of means (SEM) of
triplicate wells.
