Abstract
Deep sequencing of B cell receptor (BCR) heavy chains from a cohort of 19 COVID-19
patients from the UK reveals a stereotypical naive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 which is
consistent across patients and may be a positive indicator of disease outcome. Clonal
expansion of the B cell memory response is also observed and may be the result of memory
bystander effects. There was a strong convergent sequence signature across patients, and
we identified 777 clonotypes convergent between at least four of the COVID-19 patients,
but not present in healthy controls. A subset of the convergent clonotypes were
homologous to known SARS and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein neutralising antibodies.
Convergence was also demonstrated across wide geographies by comparison of data sets
between patients from UK, USA and China, further validating the disease association and
consistency of the stereotypical immune response even at the sequence level. These
convergent clonotypes provide a resource to identify potential therapeutic and prophylactic
antibodies and demonstrate the potential of BCR profiling as a tool to help understand and
predict positive patient responses.
Key words: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, B cell repertoire, antibody

Introduction
Since the report of the first patients in December 2019 1,2, the unprecedented global scale of
the COVID-19 pandemic has become apparent. The infectious agent, the SARS-CoV-2
betacoronavirus 3, causes mild symptoms in most cases but can cause severe respiratory
diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome in some individuals. Risk factors for
severe disease include age, male gender and underlying co-morbidities 4.
Understanding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to support
the development of therapies. Recombinant monoclonal antibodies derived from analysis of
B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires in infected patients or the immunisation of animals have
been shown to be effective against several infectious diseases including Ebola virus 5, rabies
6
and respiratory syncytial virus disease 7. Such therapeutic antibodies have the potential to
protect susceptible populations as well as to treat severe established infections.
While many vaccine approaches are underway in response to the SARS-CoV-2
outbreak, many of these compositions include as immunogens either whole, attenuated
virus or whole spike (S) protein - a viral membrane glycoprotein which mediates cell uptake
by binding to host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The antibody response to such
vaccines will be polyclonal in nature and will likely include both neutralising and nonneutralising antibodies. It is hoped that the neutralising component will be sufficient to
provide long-term SARS-CoV-2 immunity following vaccination, although other potential
confounders may exist, such as raising antibodies which mediate antibody-dependent
enhancement (ADE) of viral entry 8–10. While ADE is not proven for SARS-CoV-2, prior studies
of SARS-CoV-1 in non-human primates showed that, while some S protein antibodies from
human SARS-CoV-1 patients were protective, others enhanced the infection via ADE 11. An
alternative could be to support passive immunity to SARS-CoV-2, by administering one, or a
small cocktail of, well-characterised, neutralising antibodies.
Patients recovering from COVID-19 have already been screened to identify
neutralising antibodies, following analysis of relatively small numbers (100-500) of antibody
sequences 12,13. A more extensive BCR repertoire analysis was performed on six patients in
Stanford, USA with signs and symptoms of COVID-19 who also tested positive for SARS-CoV2 RNA 14. Although no information was provided on the patient outcomes in that study, the
analysis demonstrated preferential expression of a subset of immunoglobulin heavy chain
(IGH) V gene segments with relatively little somatic hypermutation and showed evidence of
convergent antibodies between patients.
To drive a deeper understanding of the nature of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2
infection and to identify potential therapeutic antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, we have evaluated
the BCR heavy chain repertoire from 19 individuals at various stages of their immune
response. We show that (1) there are stereotypic responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, (2)
infection stimulates both naïve and memory B cell responses, (3) sequence convergence can
be used to identify putative SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, and (4) sequence convergence
can be identified between different SARS-CoV-2 studies in different locations and using
different sample types.

Blood samples were collected from n=19 patients admitted to hospital with acute COVID-19
pneumonia. The mean age of patients was 50.2 (SD 18.5) years and 13 (68%) were male. All
patients had a clinical history consistent with COVID-19 and typical radiological changes.
Seventeen patients had a confirmatory positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. The patients
experienced an average of 11 days (range 4-20) of symptoms prior to the day on which the
blood sample was collected. Nine of the patients were still requiring hospital care but not
oxygen therapy on day of sample collection (WHO Ordinal Scale Score 3), while eight were
hospitalised requiring oxygen by conventional mask or nasal prongs (WHO Ordinal Scale
Score 4) and two were hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring high-flow
nasal oxygen (WHO Ordinal Scale Score 5). On the day of sample collection, the direct
clinical care team considered two patients to be deteriorating, four improving and the
remaining thirteen were clinically stable.

SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a stereotypic B cell response
IGHA and IGHG BCR sequencing yielded on average 135,437 unique sequences, and 23,742
clonotypes per sample (Supplementary Table 1). To characterise the B cell response in
COVID-19, we compared this BCR repertoire data to BCR repertoire data from healthy
controls obtained in a separate study 15. Comparing IGHV gene segment usage revealed a
significantly different IGHV gene usage in COVID-19 patients compared to the healthy
controls, most notably with increases in the usage of IGHV2-5 (2.6x IGHA, 1.0x IGHG
increase), IGHV2-70 (4.6x IGHA, 4.1x IGHG increase), IGHV3-30 (2.0x IGHA, 1.4x IGHG
increase), IGHV5-51 (3.5x IGHA, 2.0x IGHG increase), and IGHV4-34 (1.4x IGHA, 2.4x IGHG
increase) in the COVID-19 patients (Figure 1A). All of these V gene segments have been
previously observed in SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies16. IGHV4-34 has been
shown to bind both autoantigens 17 and commensal bacteria 18 and has been associated
with SLE 19. Our data extends this, showing that the proportion of sequences containing the
autoreactive AVY & NHS sequence motifs within the IGHV region is significantly more
frequent in improving COVID-19 patients compared to stable or deteriorating COVID-19
patients, specifically in the IGHG1 isotype subclass (p-value = 0.038; Supplementary Figure
2).
Comparing isotype subclasses showed a significant increase in the relative usage of
IGHA1 and IGHG1 in COVID-19 patients (Figure 1B) - these are the two first isotype
subclasses that are switched to upon activation of IGHM 20. There was also an increase in
the mean CDRH3 length of the BCRs in the COVID-19 patients, that was most pronounced in
the IGHA1, IGHA2 and IGHG1 isotype subclasses (Figure 1C).

SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates both naïve and memory responses
To further investigate the COVID-19-specific B cell response, we analysed the characteristics
of the BCR sequences that are consistent with recent B cell activation – somatic
hypermutation, and clonal expansion. In healthy controls, for class-switched sequences,
there is a clear unimodal distribution of sequences with different numbers of mutations,
and a mean mutation count across IGHA and IGHG isotypes of 17.6 (Figure 2A). In the
COVID-19 samples, the mean mutation count was 14.4, and there was a bimodal
distribution with a separate peak of sequences with no mutations. This bimodal distribution
was most pronounced in the IGHG1, IGHG3, and IGHA1 isotype subclasses, corresponding to
the increased isotype usages. Such a distribution is consistent with an expansion of recently
class-switched B cells that have yet to undergo somatic hypermutation. There was

considerable variation between participants in the proportion of unmutated sequences
(Supplementary Figure 1), which had no significant correlation with the number of days
since symptom onset (R = 0.09, p = 0.72), but was lower in the deteriorating compared to
improving patients (Figure 2B)
To investigate differential clonal expansion between patients, the Shannon diversity
index of each repertoire was calculated (while accounting for differences in read depth
through subsampling). A more diverse repertoire is indicative of a greater abundance of
different clonal expansions. The BCR repertoires of the COVID-19 patients were significantly
more diverse than the BCR repertoires of the healthy controls (Figure 2C); this increase in
diversity was positively correlated with an increased proportion of unmutated sequences (R
= 0.44, p = 0.061; Figure 2D). Interestingly, when we investigated the largest clonal
expansions, despite having a more diverse repertoire, the largest clonal expansions in the
COVID-19 samples were larger than in the healthy controls (Figure 2E). These large clonal
expansions were also highly mutated and had similar levels of mutation between the
COVID-19 samples and the healthy controls (Figure 2F).

Sequence convergence can be used to identify putative SARS-CoV-2 specific
antibodies
Given the skewing of the B cell response in the COVID-19 patients to specific IGHV genes,
we next investigated whether the same similarity was also seen on the BCR sequence level
between different participants. Such convergent BCR signatures have been observed in
response to other infectious diseases 21, and may be used to identify disease-specific
antibody sequences.
Of the 435,420 total clonotypes across all the COVID-19 patients, 9,646 (2.2%) were
shared between at least two of the participants (Figure 3A). As convergence could occur by
chance or be due to an unrelated memory response from commonly encountered
pathogens, the healthy control dataset was used to subtract irrelevant BCR sequences. Of
the 9,646 convergent clonotypes, 1,442 (14.9%) were also present in at least one of the 40
healthy control samples. As expected, of the convergent clonotypes that were also present
in the healthy control samples, the mean mutation count was significantly greater (Figure
3B), and the mean CDRH3 length significantly shorter (Figure 3C) than the convergent
clonotypes that were unique to the COVID-19 patients.
To identify a set of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody sequences with high confidence,
we identified 777 convergent clonotypes that were shared between at least four of the
COVID-19 patients, but not seen in the healthy controls. In parallel, for a comparison of
convergent signatures, we performed the same analysis on a cohort of seven metastatic
breast cancer patient biopsy samples 22, which identified 469 convergent clonotypes. These
convergent clonotypes were highly specific to each disease cohort (Figure 3D). The 777
COVID-19 convergent clonotypes had low mutation levels, with a mean mutation count of 2,
and only 51 clonotypes with a mean mutation greater than 5. The sequences within the
convergent clonotypes were primarily of the IGHG1 (70%) and IGHA1 (16%) subclasses
(Supplementary Figure 3A). The convergent clonotypes used a diversity of IGHV gene
segments, with IGHV3-30, IGHV3-30-3 and IGHV3-33 as the most highly represented
(Supplementary Figure 3B). This IGHV gene usage distribution differs between that of the
total repertoire, and IGHV3-30 is also the most highly used IGHV gene in the CoV-AbDab16.
We next tested whether these convergent clonotypes correlated with disease
severity. Indeed, 25 of these convergent clonotypes were found to associate with clinical

symptoms after correcting for multiple testing, of which 22 were observed at a significantly
higher frequency in improving patients (Figure 3E and Supplementary Figure 4). This is a
significantly higher proportion associated with clinical symptoms compared to that expected
by chance (p-value = 0.018 by random permutations of labels). Interestingly, some of these
clonotypes are common in patients comprising >0.1 % of a patient’s repertoire.
Furthermore, the convergent clonotypes that are associated with clinical symptoms cluster
together (Figure 3F) and are found primarily in the IGHA1 and IGHG1 isotypes (Figure 3G).

BCR clonotype sequence convergence signatures are shared between different
COVID-19 studies in different locations and from different anatomical sites
To further explore whether the convergent clonotypes observed in our study were indeed
disease specific, and to determine whether such convergence was common across studies
and geographic regions, we compared these 777 convergent clonotypes to public B cell
datasets.
First, we compared our data to RNAseq data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
obtained from five of the first infected patients in Wuhan, China 23. These samples were
obtained for the purpose of metagenomic analyses to identify the aetiological agent of the
novel coronavirus but were re-analysed to determine whether we could extract any
transcripts from BCRs. From the 10,038,758 total reads, we were able to identify 16 unique
CDR3 AA sequences (
Supplementary Table 2). Of these, one had an exact AA match to a sequence in our
data and shared the same V gene segment (IGHV3-15), and J gene segment (IGHJ4) usage
(Figure 4A). The sequence had a CDRH3 AA length of 12, so such a match is unlikely to occur
due to chance alone. The clonotype that the sequence belonged to contained 699 total
sequences and was convergent between 8 of our 19 COVID-19 patients, but not present in
the healthy controls. The clonotype was highly diverse, and the sequences had evidence of
low mutation from germline, with a mean mutation count over all sequences of 4.8
(Supplementary Figure 5).
Next, we compared our 777 convergent clonotypes to CoV-AbDab – the Coronavirus
Antibody Database [accessed 10th May 2020] 16. At the time of access, this database
contained 80 non-redundant CDRH3 sequences from published and patented antibodies
proven to bind SARS-CoV-1 and/or SARS-CoV-2. We found 6 of our clonotypes to have high
CDRH3 homology to the antibodies in CoV-AbDab (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 6).
The most striking similarity was to S304, a previously described SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2
receptor-binding domain antibody able to contribute to viral neutralisation 24. One of the
777 convergent clonotypes contained sequences with an exact CDRH3 AA sequence match
and utilised the same IGHV and IGHJ germline gene segments to S304. This clonotype was
convergent across 6 patients and had a mean mutation count of 1.1.
Finally, we compared our data to a publicly available BCR deep sequencing dataset
from six COVID-19 patients from Stanford, USA. 405 of our 777 convergent clonotypes
matched (using the same definition we used for clonotyping within our dataset) sequences
in this dataset (Figure 4C), showing the high level of convergence between studies. The
average number of clonotype matches to the Stanford COVID-19 patient repertoires was 95,
but this varied considerably between patients and timepoints. Two of the six patients were
seronegative at the day of sampling (7451 and 7453), and these two patients had the fewest
clonotype matches (16 and 14 respectively). Patient 7453 had an additional sample taken
two days later (following seroconversion), and at this point had a large increase in the

number of clonotype matches to 204. There was one of the 777 convergent clonotypes that
was found across all six of the Stanford patients, and 17 clonotypes that were found in at
least four of five samples from seroconverted patients, but not found in the seronegative
patients (Supplementary Table 3).

We have used deep sequencing of the BCR heavy chain repertoire to evaluate the B cell
responses of 19 individuals with COVID-19. In agreement with previous studies, there was a
skewing of the repertoire in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an increased use of
certain V genes, an increase in the proportion of antibodies with longer CDRH3s, and an
altered isotype subclass distribution 14. The significantly increased usage of IGHA1 observed
in the COVID-19 patients is in line with mucosal responses, where the longer hinge in IGHA1
compared to IGHA2 may offer advantages in antigen recognition by allowing higher avidity
bivalent interactions with distantly spaced antigens 25.
As anticipated, given the novel nature of the virus, that SARS-CoV-2 infection largely
stimulated a characteristically naïve response, rather than a reactivation of pre-existing
memory B cells – (1) there was an increased prevalence of unmutated antigen-experienced
class-switched BCR sequences, (2) an increase in the diversity of class-switched IGHA and
IGHG BCRs, and (3) an increase in the usage of isotype subclasses that are associated with
recent viral immunity. These observations are consistent with an increase in the frequency
of recently activated B cells in response to SARS-CoV-2. In addition to the naïve response,
there was also evidence of a proportion of the response arising from memory recall. In the
COVID-19 patients, the largest clonal expansions were highly mutated, equivalent to the
level observed in healthy control cohort. Such a secondary response to SARS-CoV-2 has
been previously observed 26, and may be due to recall of B cells activated in response to
previously circulating human coronaviruses, as recently highlighted27,28.
We observed a potential relationship between repertoire characteristics and disease
state, with improving patients showing a tendency towards a higher proportion of
unmutated sequences. The increased prevalence of autoreactive IGHV4-34 sequences in
improving COVID-19 patients compared to stable or deteriorating COVID-19 patients
potentially suggests a role for natural or autoreactive antibodies in resolving infection and
lower risk of pathology. There is a clear need to expand on these findings by using larger
sample cohorts and gathering more clinical data to aid understanding of the differences
between individuals that respond with mild versus severe disease and have different
recovery patterns. Building upon these observations could help to inform the future
development of diagnostic assays to monitor and predict the progression of disease in
infected patients.
A large number (777) of highly convergent clonotypes unique to COVID-19 were
identified. Our approach of subtracting the convergent clonotypes also observed in healthy
controls 15, allowed us to identify convergence specific to the disease cohort. The unbiased
nature of the BCR repertoire analysis approach means that, whilst these convergent
clonotypes are likely to include many antibodies to the spike protein and other parts of the
virus they may also include other protective antibodies, including those to host proteins.
Characterisation of the heavy chains we have identified, coupled with matched light chains
to generate functional antibodies will permit analysis of the binding sites and neutralising

potential of these antibodies. The report that plasma derived from recently recovered
donors with high neutralising antibody titres can improve the outcome of patients with
severe disease 29, supports the hypotheses that intervention with a therapeutic antibody
has the potential to be an effective treatment. A manufactured monoclonal antibody or
combination of antibodies would also provide a simpler, scalable and safer approach than
plasma therapy.
Sequence convergence between our 777 convergent clonotypes with heavy chains
from published and patented SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies16 supports several
observations. Firstly, it demonstrates that our approach of finding a convergent sequence
signature is a useful method for enriching disease-specific antibodies, as we find matches to
known SARS-CoV spike-binding antibodies. Secondly, it shows that the clonotypes observed
in response to SARS-CoV-2 overlap with those to SARS-CoV-1, presumably explained by the
relatively high homology of the two related viruses 3. Indeed, here we show that there is an
overrepresentation of clonotypes that correlate with patient clinical symptoms than is
expected by chance, and these BCR sequences are associated with the dominant IgA1 and
IgG1 responses. Finally, it shows that the convergence extends beyond our UK COVID-19
disease cohort.
Further evidence for convergence extending beyond our disease cohort came from
the comparisons of our 777 convergent clonotypes to deep sequencing datasets from China
23
and the USA 14. The dataset from the USA is also from BCR sequencing of the peripheral
blood of COVID-19 patients, and here we found matches to 405 of our 777 clonotypes. The
dataset from China was from total RNA sequencing of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of
SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Only 16 unique CDRH3 sequences could be identified in this
whole dataset, but one of them matched a convergent clonotype in the current study,
showing that convergence can be seen both between different locations, and different
sample types. We believe that the identification of such high BCR sequence convergence
between geographically distinct and independent datasets could be highly significant and
validates the disease association of the clonotypes, as well as the overall approach.
In summary, our BCR repertoire analysis provides information on the specific nature
of the B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The information generated has the potential
to facilitate the treatment of COVID-19 by supporting diagnostic approaches to predict the
progression of disease, informing vaccine development and enabling the development of
therapeutic antibody treatments and prophylactics.

Methods
Clinical information gathering

Peripheral blood was obtained from patients admitted with acute COVID-19 pneumonia to
medical wards at Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK, after informed consent by the direct
care team (NHS HRA RES Ethics 19/SC/0361). Venous blood was collected in EDTA
Vacutainers (BD). Patient demographics and clinical information relevant to their admission
were collected by members of the direct care team, including duration of symptoms prior to
blood sample collection. Current severity was mapped to the WHO Ordinal Scale of Severity.
Whether patients at time of sample collection were clinically Improving, Stable or
Deteriorating was subjectively determined by the direct clinical team prior to any sample
analysis. This determination was primarily made on the basis of whether requirement for

supplemental oxygen was increasing, stable, or decreasing comparing current day to
previous three days.

Sample collection and initial processing

Blood samples were centrifuged at 150 xg for 15 minutes at room temperature to separate
plasma. The cell pellet was resuspended with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS without
calcium and magnesium, Sigma) to 20 ml, layered onto 15 ml Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE
Healthcare) and then centrifuged at 400 xg for 30 minutes at room temperature without
brake. Mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were extracted from the buffy coat and washed twice
with PBS at 300 xg for 8 min. PBMCs were counted with Trypan blue (Sigma) and viability of
>96% was observed. 5x106 PBMCs were resuspended in RLT (Qiagen) and incubated at room
temperature for 10 min prior to storage at –80°C. Consecutive donor samples with sufficient
RLT samples progressed to RNA preparation and BCR preparation and are included in this
manuscript.
Metastatic breast cancer biopsy samples were collected and RNA extracted as part
of a previously reported cohort 22.

RNA prep & BCR sequencing

Total RNA from 5x106 PBMCs was isolated using RNeasy kits (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was
generated from total RNA using SuperScript RT IV (Invitrogen) and IgA and IgG isotype
specific primers 30 including UMIs at 50 oC for 45 min (inactivation at 80 oC for 10 min).
The resulting cDNA was used as template for High Fidelity PCR amplification (KAPA,
Roche) using a set of 6 FR1-specific forward primers 30 including sample-specific barcode
sequences (6bp) and a reverse primer specific to the RT primer (initial denaturation at 95 oC
for 3 min, 25 cycles at 98 oC for 20 sec, 60 oC for 30 sec, 72 oC for 1 min and final extension
at 72 oC for 7 min). The amount of Ig amplicons (~450bp) was quantified by TapeStation
(Beckman Coulter) and gel-purified.
Dual-indexed sequencing adapters (KAPA) were ligated onto 500ng amplicons per
patient using the HyperPrep library construction kit (KAPA) and the adapter-ligated libraries
were finally PCR-amplified for 3 cycles (98 oC for 15 sec, 60 oC for 30 sec, 72 oC for 30 sec,
final extension at 72 oC for 1min). Pools of 10 and 9 libraries were sequenced on an Illumina
MiSeq using 2x300 bp chemistry.

Sequence processing

The Immcantation framework (docker container v3.0.0) was used for sequence processing
31,32
. Briefly, paired-end reads were joined based on a minimum overlap of 20 nt, and a max
error of 0.2, and reads with a mean phred score below 20 were removed. Primer regions,
including UMIs and sample barcodes, were then identified within each read, and trimmed.
Together, the sample barcode, UMI, and constant region primer were used to assign
molecular groupings for each read. Within each grouping, usearch 33, was used to subdivide
the grouping, with a cutoff of 80% nucleotide identity, to account for randomly overlapping
UMIs. Each of the resulting groupings is assumed to represent reads arising from a single
RNA. Reads within each grouping were then aligned, and a consensus sequence determined.
For each processed sequence, IgBlast 34 was used to determine V, D and J gene
segments, and locations of the CDRs and FWRs. Isotype was determined based on
comparison to germline constant region sequences. Sequences annotated as unproductive

by IgBlast were removed. The number of mutations within each sequence was determined
using the shazam R package 32.
Sequences were clustered to identify those arising from clonally related B cells; a
process termed clonotyping. Sequences from all samples were clustered together to also
identify convergent clusters between samples. Clustering was performed using a previously
described algorithm 35. Clustering required identical V and J gene segment usage, identical
CDRH3 length, and allowed 1 AA mismatch for every 10 AAs within the CDRH3. Cluster
centers were defined as the most common sequence within the cluster. Lineages were
reconstructed from clusters using the alakazam R package 36. The similarity tree of the
convergent clonontype CDR3 sequences was generated through a kmer similarity matrix
between sequences in R.

Public healthy control data processing
The healthy control BCR sequence dataset used here has been described previously 15. Only
samples from participants aged 10 years or older, and from peripheral blood were used,
resulting in a mean age of 28 (range: 11-51). Furthermore, only class-switched sequences
were considered.

Public SARS-CoV-2 bronchoalveolar lavage RNAseq data processing
The bronchoalveolar lavage data comes from a previously published study of SARS-CoV-2
infection 23, with data available under the PRJNA605983 BioProject on NCBI. MIXCR v3.0.3
was used, with default settings, to extract reads mapping to antibody genes from the total
RNASeq data 37.

Public CoV-AbDab data processing

All public CDRH3 AA sequences associated with published or patented SARS-CoV-1 or SARSCoV-2 binding antibodies were mined from CoV-AbDab16, downloaded on 10th May 2020. A
total of 80 non-redundant CDRH3s were identified (100% identity threshold). These
sequences were then clustered alongside the representative CDRH3 sequence from each of
our 777 convergent clones using CD-HIT 38, at an 80% sequence identity threshold (allowing
at most a CDRH3 length mismatch of 1 AA). Cluster centres containing at least one CoVAbDab CDRH3 and one convergent clone CDRH3 were further investigated.

Public COVID-19 BCR sequence data processing
The fourteen MiSeq "read 1" FASTQ datasets from the six SARS-CoV-2 patients analysed in
Nielsen et al.14 were downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive 39. IgBlast 34 was used to
identify heavy chain V, D, and J gene rearrangements and antibody regions. Unproductive
sequences, sequences with out-of-frame V and J genes, and sequences missing the CDRH3
region were removed from the downstream analysis. Sequences with 100% amino acid and
isotype matches were collapsed. To circumvent the disparity in collapsed dataset sizes
between pairs of replicates, we selected the replicate with the highest number of sequences
for downstream analysis.

Convergent Clonotyping Matching to Public Repertoires
The public SARS-CoV-2-positive14 and healthy control BCR repertoires40 were scanned for
clonotype matches to our 777 convergent clonotype cluster centres. A BCR repertoire

sequence was determined as a match if it had identical V and J genes, the same length
CDRH3, and was within 1 AA mismatch per 10 CDRH3 AAs to a convergent clonotype
representative sequence.

Statistical analysis and graphing

Statistical analysis and plotting were performed using R 41. Plotting was performed using
ggplot2 42. Sequence logos were created using ggseqlogo 43. Specific statistical tests used are
detailed in the figure legends. Correlations of IGHV4-34 autoreactive motifs and convergent
clonotypes was performed by manova in R.

Figure 3. Convergent BCR sequence signature within individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. A) Data from all patients and
healthy controls were clustered together to identify convergent clonotypes. Shown is the number of clonotypes shared by
different numbers of participants, grouped by whether the clonotypes are also present in the healthy control dataset. Of the
convergent clonotypes, B) the mean mutation count, and C) the CDRH3 AA sequence length was compared between those
that were convergent only within the SARS-CoV-2 patients, and those that were also convergent with the healthy control
dataset. D) Heatmap of the 777 convergent COVID-19-associated clonotypes (observed between 4 or more COVID-19
participants) with the 469 convergent clonotypes from seven metastatic breast cancer (BC) patient biopsy samples,
demonstrating that the convergent signatures are unique to each disease cohort. E) Percentage frequencies of four example
convergent clonotypes grouped by clinical status. F) Similarity tree of convergent clonotype cluster centers that are
significantly associated with clinical status. Groups (i) and (ii) indicate groups of similar convergent clonotypes. An
alignment of group (ii) provided adjacent. G) Proportions of IGHA and IGHG of the convergent clonotypes that are
associated with patients with improving symptoms.

Figure 4. Matches of the 777 convergent clonotypes identified in the present study to other SARS-CoV-2 studies. A) CDRH3
sequence, and IGHV/IGHJ gene segments of a sequence identified in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a SARS-CoV-2
patient from a Chinese cohort (shown across the top in black text), and a CDRH3 AA sequence logo unpacking the sequence
diversity present in the convergent clonotype found in the COVID-19 patients in this study that had an exact AA match. B)
CDRH3 sequence, and IGHV/IGHJ gene segment of an antibody in the CoV-AbDab (S304) that has SARS-CoV-1 and SARSCoV-2 neutralising activity, alongside a CDRH3 AA sequence logo unpacking the sequence diversity in the convergent
clonotype found in the COVID-19 patients in this study that had an exact AA match. C) Comparison of convergent
clonotypes to the BCR data from Nielsen et al 14. Plotted along the x-axis are the 405 convergent clonotypes represented in
at least one Nielsen et al. dataset. Each row represents a separate BCR repertoire from Nielsen et al.; pink shading indicates
that the convergent clonotype has a match in the Nielsen dataset.

Supplementary Figure 5. Lineage trees of the convergent clonotype that matched to the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid data.
Each lineage tree represents the members of the clonotype from each of the eight patients it was present in. Each node
represents a unique sequence within the clonotype lineage tree, with the size indicative of the number of duplicate
sequences present. Numbers on the edges of adjoining nodes show the number of mutations between the sequences.
