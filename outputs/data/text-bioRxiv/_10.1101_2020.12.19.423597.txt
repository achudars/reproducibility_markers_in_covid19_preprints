Abstract

31

COVID-19, which has resulted a worldwide health crisis with more than 74.9 million confirmed

32

cases worldwide by December 2020, is caused by a newly emerging coronavirus identified and

33

named SARS-CoV-2 in February in Wuhan, China. Experiences in defeating SARS, which infested

34

during 2002-2003, can be used in treating the new disease. However, comparative genomics and

35

epidemiology studies have shown much difference between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which

36

underlies the different clinical features and therapies in between those two diseases. Further studies

37

comparing transcriptomes infected by these two viruses to uncover the differences in host responses

38

would be necessary. Here we conducted a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of SARS-CoV and

39

SARS-CoV-2-infected human cell lines, including Caco-2, Calu-3, H1299. Clustering analysis and

40

expression of ACE2 show that SARS-CoV-2 has broader but weaker infection, where the largest

41

discrepancy occurs in the epithelial lung cancer cell, Calu-3. SARS-CoV-2 genes also show less

42

tissue specificity than SARS-CoV genes. Furthermore, we detected more general but moderate

43

immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected transcriptomes by comparing weighted gene co-

44

expression networks and modules. Our results suggest a different immune therapy and treatment

45

scheme for COVID-19 patients than the ones used on SARS patients. The wider but weaker

46

permissiveness and host responses of virus infection may also imply a long-term existence of SARS-

47

CoV-2 among human populations.

Introduction

60

Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has cause 74.9 million confirmed infections

61

worldwide including more than 1.41 million deaths by December 18th, 2020, evolving to a

62

threatening pandemic (Dong, Du, & Gardner, 2020). The etiological pathogen of the emerging

63

pneumonia was at first identified as 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by genome sequencing and

64

epidemiological investigations (Tan et al., 2020), and was later officially named as "SARS-CoV-2"

65

on February 11th, 2020 by ICTV (Gorbalenya et al., 2020).

66

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are critical strains of virus for human and vertebrates, within the family

67

of Coronaviridae under the order of Nidovirales (Hu, Ge, Wang, & Shi, 2015). Mostly hosted by

68

bats, they readily infect cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal system of human and a large

69

proportion of wild animals (L. F. Wang et al., 2006) (Chen & Guo, 2016). Since 21st century,

70

outbreaks of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the Middle East

71

Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012, along with the current COVID have provided evidence for

72

the possibility of human-to-human transmission of CoVs, which signifies potential future outbreaks

73

(Poletto et al., 2014) (Cui, Li, & Shi, 2019). From a genomic perspective, SARS-CoV from 2003 is

74

the most related human CoV to SARS-CoV-2 with a 79.5% similarity in nucleotides, with merely

75

380 amino acid substitution mostly in accessory open reading frames (ORFs) 8a, 8b, and 3b, then

76

followed by MERS-CoV at about 50% similarity. (Zhang & Holmes, 2020) (H. Wang et al., 2020)

77

The essential structural spike protein has no amino acid substitution in its receptor-bind motif (RBM)

78

(Wu et al., 2020), but there may be a functional difference associated with the six mutations in other

79

counterparts of RBD (Wu et al., 2020). Further comparison between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

80

may provide more insights into understanding of COVID.

81

Despite the viruses' genomic similarity and common respiratory signs like fever, dry cough,

82

and dyspnea similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 patients display fewer common features such

83

as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort (Booth et al., 2003). In terms of clinical

84

outcome, COVID patients with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (nausea, vomiting or diarrhea) are

85

oftentimes severe and associated with family clustering (Jin et al., 2020). Ackermann et al. (2020)

86

demonstrated that COVID patients and SARS patients have atypical pneumonia regarding

87

pulmonary vasculature, where histological analysis among COVID-19 patients shows extensive

88

thrombosis and microangiopathy relative to acute respiratory distress syndromes (ARDS). COVID-

89

19 patients also have higher incidence of alveolar capillary microthrombi and new tissue growth

90

(Ackermann et al., 2020).

91

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar to certain degrees on their pathogenesis and

92

molecular mechanism. Amino acid sequence of their spike proteins(-S) shares the essential residues

93

to effective binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2), allowing SARS-2-S and

94

SARS-S to employ the same entry site with the same cleavage protease TPMRSS2 (Hoffmann et

95

al., 2020). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 likens SARS-CoV in terms of cell tropism and infection

96

spectrum: most common cell lines of humans are readily susceptible to SARS-S and SARS-2-S

97

mediated entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020) (Hui et al., 2020), and they target identical cell types in lung

98

infections (types I and II pneumocyte and alveolar macrophage) (Chu et al., 2020). However, some

99

of the SARS-CoV-2’s mechanisms may account for its distinctive epidemiological and clinical

100

characteristics. A faster viral replication (3.2-fold higher than SARS-CoV) is observed in SARS-

101

CoV-2 infected human organs samples (Chan, Zhang, et al., 2020). The underlying reason may be

102

attributed to the difference in host immune response pattern. SARS-CoV-2 does not significantly

103

trigger any upregulation in interferons; activations of proinflammatory cytokines are also

104

significantly infrequent in COVID-19 patients (Chu et al., 2020). The combinations of these traits

105

may lead to remarkably high viral load present at upper respiratory tracts long before symptoms

106

emerge (To et al., 2020).

107

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2’s difference at host transcriptome level can create a discrepancy

108

in host immune-responses, which leads to differentiated symptoms among patients. Although

109

research on pathogenesis and clinical records of COVID-19 are abundant, comprehensive studies

110

on human subjects’ post-infection transcriptome are still largely lacking. In this study, we focused

111

on human cell lines challenged by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, computed permissiveness, tissue-

112

specificity, and constructed a weighted correlation network (WGCNA) of gene expression profile

113

as well as the subsequent gene ontology analysis. With bioinformatic approach, the study may give

114

elemental understanding to COVID-19’s characteristics of all kind. While nowadays, there are few

115

treatment options for COVID-19 (Dong, Hu, & Gao, 2020) (Mehra, Desai, Kuy, Henry, & Patel,

116

2020), and serums of recovered SARS patients have only exhibited limited efficacy in reducing

117

SARS-2-S mediated entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020, analysis on their transcriptome would have

122

SARS-CoV-2 manifests lower permissiveness for most cell lines

123

Transcriptomes of host cells with virion reveals the hosts’ responses, which differ across

124

various virus, tissue, and infection time. To uncover those differences between the infected cell

125

responses of the two coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 , we collected the RNA-seq data

126

of 42 samples of three cell lines (non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell line H1299, epithelial

127

lung cell line Calu-3 and epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2) at different hpi

128

(hours post infection, 4h, 12h and 24h for Calu-3 and Caco2 while 4h, 12h, 24h and 36h for H1299)

129

from Emanuel et al (Series Accession Number: GSE148729, Emanuel et al., 2020). We mapped

130

those RNA-seq reads to the combined genome of human and SARS-CoV-2 using HISAT2 (version

131

2.1.0), then measured the proportion of viral reads in the transcriptomes by cell lines and infection

132

time. As shown, the proportion of viral reads varies among different cell types, and generally, that

133

of perfect viral reads from SARS-CoV were higher than those from SARS-CoV-2 in both Caco-2

134

and Calu-3 (Students’ t test, p < 0.05, Figure 1), showing a severer infection of SARS-CoV than

135

SARS-CoV-2. However, almost no infection was detected in H1299. Besides the increasing trend

136

of viral reads along infection time, we also detected a decrease of SARS-CoV-2 reads from 12 hpi

137

to 24 hpi in Calu-3, which may imply the recovery of host cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure

138

1). Our results are consistent to those reported by Emanuel et al (2020).

147

To briefly elucidate the differences of transcriptomes between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

148

infected cells, we also measured the transcripts per million (TPM) as expression level of both human

149

and viral genes by StringTie (version 1.3.3b, –e –A). The k-means cluster analysis is applied to

150

determine the host transcriptome similarity across samples of cell lines with various treatments and

151

time points (Figure 2A). Caco-2 and H1299 cells show almost the same topologic structure and

152

clustered well together in the trees, but Calu-3 cells not. In SARS-CoV-infected transcriptomes,

153

three time points of Calu-3 cells clustered together and located the outmost of the tree, while the 12

154

hpi and 24 hpi of SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells clustered with Caco-2 cells. The results show

155

that Calu-3 cells responded differently than other cells in infection of SARS-CoV-2 from that of

156

SARS-CoV (Figure 2A).

157

The expression level of ACE2 gene is deemed decisive to the magnitude of viral

158

permissiveness, because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 employ ACE2 as the only site for spike

159

protein mediated entry into human cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Hence the expression abundance

160

of ACE2 can present the magnitude of viral permissiveness. To further illustrate the differences in

161

Calu-3 cells resulted by these two coronaviruses, we compared the expression level of ACE2 among

162

cell lines infected by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 along time series. Among all, ACE2 are

163

expressed much higher at 12 hpi in SARS-CoV-infected Calu-3 cells than SARS-CoV-2-infected

164

ones (Students’ t test, p = 0.032, Figure 2B). Our results show a wider permissiveness of SARS-

165

CoV-2 in cell types, and host may respond differently from 12 hpi to 24 hpi in Calu-3 cells, an

166

epithelial lung cell line.

167

To further showcase the differences among cell types, we employed a method from

168

Kryuchkova-Mostacci and Robinson-Rechavi (2016) to calculate the tissue-specificity index (τ)

169

based on the expression level of viral genes, measured in transcripts per kilobase million (TPM),

170

among three cell types and 3-4 time points. Genes of SARS-CoV-2 have lower τ values than SARS-

171

CoV (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05), showing weaker tissue-/time-specificity (Figure 2C). Most

172

genes (8 out of 13) in SARS-CoV have τ values greater than 0.6, with higher tissue-/time-specificity.

173

In contrast, only 3 of 11 genes in SARS-CoV-2 have τ values greater than 0.6. Interestingly, genes

174

with lower expression specificity (with τ less than 0.6) in tissue/time show much higher expression

175

levels (supplementary table S1&S2).

SARS-CoV-2 induces broader immune responses than SARS-CoV does
Next, we compared the detailed host responses between SARS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-2-

186

infected cells, by constructing weighted gene co-expression networks through R package “WGCNA”

187

(Langfelder P. and Horvath S., 2008). The soft-thresholding power indicates the scale-free topology

188

of weighted gene co-expression networks (Zhang and Horvath, 2005). In SARS-CoV-infected

189

network, power 5 is the lowest power to fit the scale-free topology while power 9 in SARS-CoV-2-

190

infected network, showing quite different network topologies (Sup Fig 1A, B). Then we detected

191

co-expression modules in these two networks, respectively (Sup Fig 1A, B). Most of the 24 modules

192

detected in SARS-CoV-infected network can be related to modules in SARS-CoV-2-infected

193

network, but only 7 of 28 modules in SARS-CoV-2-infected network can be related to modules in

194

SARS-CoV-infected network (Figure 3A).

195

To relate modules to biological functions and illustrate host responses, we applied functional

196

annotation to each module of the two networks by R package “anRichment” (supplementary

197

table1,2, ref), finding that the module denoted as black in SARS-CoV-infected network and the one

198

denoted as red in SARS-CoV-infected network both enriched with Gene Ontology (GO) terms of

199

immune responses (Figure 3B, C). 55 of those terms are overlapping between two viral-infected

200

networks, with higher enrichment ratio in SARS-CoV-2-infected network. Most of them are

201

essential non-specific immune response pathways and responses (Figure 3B). These fundamental

202

functions include the reception, response, and signaling pathways of interferons and phagocytic

203

leukocytes. There were only 3 uniquely enriched term in SARS-CoV-infected network, but 98 in

204

SARS-CoV-2-infected network (Figure 3B, C). Our functional annotations show that SARS-CoV-2

205

induced broader immune responses.

222

SARS-CoV-infected transcriptome (Mann-whitney U test, p < 0.001) (Figure 4A). Furthermore, we

223

compared their expression levels in Calu-3 cells as most the transcriptome differences occur on

224

Calu-3 cell line at 12 hpi and 24 hpi (Figure 2). Surprisingly, the genes involved in immune

225

responses exhibit significantly lower expression in SARS-CoV-2-infected transcriptomes than

226

SARS-CoV-infected ones (Mann-whitney U test, p<0.001), despite that it happened solely at 12 hpi

227

(Figure 4B). Those results indicate that the common immune responses to these two coronaviruses

228

are weaker but more specific in SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomes than in SARS-CoV transcriptome.

Discussion

238

Based on percentage of viral poly-A RNA transcript in human cell line samples of Caco-2,

239

Calu-3, and H1299, we determined that SARS-CoV-2 is less capable of infecting and infesting host

240

cells. Upon infection broadness, SARS-CoV-2 infections are more ubiquitous across all tissue with

241

a significantly lower (0.72-fold) tissue-specificity compared to SARS-CoV. These findings may

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.19.423597; this version posted December 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this

242

explain the universal low case fatality rate (CFR) of 3.2% among COVID-19 confirmed cases (Dong,

243

Du, & Gardner, 2020), compared to a CFR of 11% in the short outbreak of SARS in 2003 (Chan-

244

Yeung & Xu, 2003). The clustering pattern of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2) also matches an

245

aforementioned clinical distinction, the co-exhibition of GI and respiratory symptoms, of COVID-

246

19, frequently leading to worse prognosis (Jin et al., 2020) (Garland, Kumar, & Borum, 2020). Our

247

results might demonstrate a broader infection spectrum of SARS-CoV-2, leading to frequently

248

documented complications and complication-induced mortality (Guo et al., 2020) (Babapoor-

249

Farrokhran et al., 2020).

250

More importantly, SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome is found to have more annotated (2.86-fold)

251

non-specific immunity related functions, including cell pathways of interferons, leukocyte activities,

252

and specific lymphocyte activations. However, the expression level of those overlapped functions

253

is lower in SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomes compared to SARS-CoV. As innate immune responses

254

being the first and crucial response against viral infection, COVID-19 patients are speculated of

255

having a wider range of signs and symptoms triggered by multiple inflammation but to a mild extent.

256

Therefore, unlike SARS patients manifesting few but stark and easily identifiable symptoms like

257

abnormally high fever and readily progressive pneumonia (P. K. S. Chan et al., 2006), the mild and

258

cold-mimicking symptoms may account for relatively low alertness and awareness of emerging

259

COVID patients, catalyzing invisible chains of transmission in community and nosocomial settings

260

due to testing inefficiency, which leads to an rapidly-spreading and uncontrolled global pandemic.

261

Our findings provide implications in preventative and treatment strategies. As evidenced by

262

our study that COVID-19 has a further potential for wide-range spreading, universal testing and

263

masking would be crucial to identify asymptomatic and incubated patients and cut off invisible

264

spreads within communities, which is recommended in early onset countries and regions such as

265

China and Hong Kong (K. H. Chan & Yuen, 2020). Furthermore, applications of large dose anti-

266

inflammatories like corticosteroids shall be prudent and to an extent with simultaneous uses antiviral

267

drugs out of already weak innate responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections, in order to to achieve an

268

optimal clinical outcome for COVID patients with especially mild to moderate symptoms.

269

There are some limitations to our study. First, the RNA-seq data on which all subsequent

270

analyses are based on is sequenced from cultured samples of three human cell line, which is in lack

271

of genetic variations and versatile cell process and systemic immune response functions facilitated

272

by partilar lymphocytes. Second, the differential characteristics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

273

infected transcriptome may not be able to apply to all strains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 due

274

to limited inclusion of viral strains in cell line treatments. Further investigations on SARS-CoV-2

275

transcriptome are recommended to perform on a larger range of live tissues or organoids of

276

cardiovascular and urinary systems to elucidate a more well-rounded host response and viral

277

infection profiling.

Mapping, quantification, and clustering

288

RNA-seq reads were mapped to a combined genome of human (gencode, v34) and SARS-CoV

289

(GCF_000864885.1) or SARS-CoV-2 (GCF_009858895.2) using HISAT2 (version 2.1.0) (Kim et

290

al. 2015). Reads mapped to human and viral genome were considered as the effective libraries and

291

are used to calculate proportions of viral reads and expression levels. Expression levels were

292

measured as transcripts per million (TPM) using StringTie (version 1.3.3b, –e –A) (Pertea et al.

293

2015). TPMs of human genes were used to do the clustering of samples using R function “hclust”

294

based on their square Euclidean distance.

Measuring tissue specificity (τ)
A measurement of tissue-specificity denoted as τ were used as Kryuchkova-Mostacci N. and
Robinson-Rechavi M. (2016), except that TPM values were used instead of RPKM.

Constructing weighted gene co-expression networks and module detection

302

To compare the transcriptome difference between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infected

303

human cell lines, we constructed the weighted gene co-expression networks and detected modules

304

of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-infected transcriptomes using step-by-step method according to

305

the R package “WGCNA” (Langfelder P. and Horvath S., 2008). Corresponding modules between

306

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were detected by performing Fisher Exact test on overlapping genes

307

of any two modules in each transcriptome.

308
309
310

Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis
R function “enrichmentAnalysis” from package “anRichment” was performed on modules of

311

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

infected

transcriptomes to

detected module functions

312

(https://horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/CoexpressionNetwork/GeneAnnotation/). Only GO terms

313

of biological process were selected. GO terms with Bonferroni adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 and

314

enrichment ratio ≥ 2 were used in further analysis.
