Abstract: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known
as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), is a highly infectious RNA virus. A still-debated
percentage of patients develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after infection, whose
symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue. Acute and life-threatening
respiratory symptoms are experienced by 10-20% of symptomatic patients, particularly those with
underlying medical conditions that includes diabetes, COPD and pregnancy. One of the main
challenges in the containment of COVID-19 is the identification and isolation of asymptomatic/presymptomatic individuals. As communities re-open, large numbers of people will need to be tested
and contact-tracing of positive patients will be required to prevent additional waves of infections
and enable the continuous monitoring of the viral loads COVID-19 positive patients. A number of
molecular assays are currently in clinical use to detect SARS-CoV-2.

Many of them can

accurately test hundreds or even thousands of patients every day. However, there are presently
no testing platforms that enable more than 10,000 tests per day. Here, we describe the foundation
for the REcombinase Mediated BaRcoding and AmplificatioN Diagnostic Tool (REMBRANDT), a
high-throughput Next Generation Sequencing-based approach for the simultaneous screening of
over 100,000 samples per day. The REMBRANDT protocol includes direct two-barcoded
amplification of SARS-CoV-2 and control amplicons using an isothermal reaction, and the
downstream library preparation for Illumina sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. This protocol
represents a potentially powerful approach for community screening, a major bottleneck for
testing samples from a large patient population for COVID-19.

Introduction: COVID-19 is an infectious disease whose etiopathogenic agent is the Severely
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA virus (1). To date, this viral
infection has globally affected over 4.5 million of patients and claimed more than 300,000 lives
(2). The enormous volume of COVID-19 patients has placed significant strain on healthcare
systems around the world and led to the confinement of over half of the world’s population.
Different regions of the world are enduring different stages in the battle against COVID19. These range from initial identification of acute COVID-19 cases to preparing to re-open
schools and businesses. Regardless, rapid large-scale screening for COVID-19 is essential. At
present, the efficacy of seroconversion tests is still to be determined. Moreover, seroconversion
following a SARS-CoV-2 infection displays an as yet unknown protective immunity (3). Thus,
detection of the viral RNA genome remains the best predictor of both early infection, pre- or
asymptomatic stages as well as an indicator of viral clearance and reduced or eliminated viral
transmissibility. To accommodate state- and country-wide populations that will require serial
monitoring of 1-100 million residents, a scalable diagnostic test is required that may be
established with widely available and existing equipment.
Here, we describe, and provide reduction-to-practice data of a mass COVID-19 screening
platform: Recombinase Mediated BaRcoding/AmplificatioN Diagnostic Tool (REMBRANDT;
Figure 1). This protocol contains a number of key advances that maximize output and sensitivity
whilst retaining speed and efficiency. Specifically, REMBRANDT uses recombination and repair
enzymes to detect and amplify the viral genomic RNA (4). The amplification simultaneously tags
the individual samples with dual barcoded primers (Figure 2). This critical step rapidly generates
DNA products that are significantly more stable than RNA. Utilizing two independent barcoded
primers per well enables a single patient sample within a 96-well plate to be independently marked
with a well-specific barcode and a plate-specific barcode. This algorithm reduces the number of
barcodes 100-fold from conventional barcoding methods. Once barcoded, the patient samples
from multiple 96-well plates can be pooled and purified, ultimately minimizing reagent usage, time

and sample-to-sample variation. While the system is further scalable, we provide barcoded
primers sufficient to distinguish individual samples for ninety six 96-well plates or 9,216 patient
samples. Processing these samples together enables rapid library construction using any one of
the barcoded Illumina kits. Utilizing 12 Illumina barcodes allows further sample multiplexing such
that twelve different 9,216 combined samples may be further mixed together to perform Next
Generation (NextGen) Sequencing analysis of 110,592 patient samples in a single run on a
number of Illumina-based platforms. The smaller numbers of barcodes requires less timeconsuming computational processing, as trimmed sequences can be quickly divided based on
barcode, and mapped to SARS-CoV-2 N gene or a control human gene (RNAse P) sequences.
Importantly, this protocol introduces a unique, synthetic SARS-CoV-2 N gene sequence into every
96-well plate. This control has identical primer annealing regions to the SARS-CoV-2 N gene but
contains 6 engineered base pair substitutions that distinguishes it from native sequences;
providing an internal quality control for the process and a measure of batch effects. The laboratory
and computational framework is designed to maximize SARS-CoV-2 detection efficiency while
minimizing reagent usage, processing and turn-around time.

Methods:
Starting Considerations:
1: This protocol can effectively analyze 110,592 patient samples using 192 total barcoding
primers (96 forward and 96 reverse) and 12 different adapters for High-Throughput sequencing.
However, for ease of description the steps outlined here are defined for 9,216 samples or ninety
six 96-well plates. To achieve this number, the protocol (steps RS1-8) should be performed 96
times. Each 96-well plate uses the same set of barcoded reverse primers to identify the patient
and a separate barcoded forward primer to identify the plate. Each plate of 96 samples therefore
has a different barcoded forward primer. This ultimately enables 12 different Illumina libraries to

be combined and analyzed together for Next Generation Sequencing to reach the maximum
potential of over 110,000 samples. To reach maximum throughput, the use of robotic
aliquoting/pipetting system is recommended.
2: For this method, the RNA extraction from patients’ samples is not required. Based on previously
reports, the protocol may be performed without anticipated issues using RNA extracted from
nasopharyngeal swabs, following the CDC guidelines. However, recent manuscripts suggest that
patients’ samples can be processed directly from nasopharyngeal swab, throat swab and saliva
skipping the RNA extraction process (5). These direct detection approaches may reduce the
number of amplification-available viral RNAs. Comparable results to commercial RNA extraction
kits have been obtained using a 5-min direct detection preparation method of nasopharyngeal
samples following 1:1 dilution with the Quick Extract DNA extraction Solution (Lucigen) (6).
Moreover, different types of specimens, such as saliva, may be more sensitive for the detection
of SARS-CoV-2 (7). We currently advise nasopharyngeal swabs as recommended by the US
CDC. However, the saliva observations described above would appear to be the least invasive
and easiest for patient collection.
3: RNA isothermal amplification can provide high sensitivity but are also prone to contamination.
We recommend the use appropriate PPE, and the decontamination of benches to prevent RNA
degradation. Sterile and barrier tips are recommended throughout, as is the separation of
research spaces for the amplification, purification and library preparation steps.
4: Personnel safety must be a priority when performing any COVID-19 diagnostic approaches.
Please refer to CDC guidelines for the most appropriate use of equipment and PPEs when
working with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses.

In vitro RNA transcription: to generate positive control RNAs, T7-flanked forward primers and
standard reverse primers (Supplementary Information) were used in a PCR reaction to apply a
region of each target gene with Q5 polymerase. Templates used in this work were COVID-19-N
(10006625, IDT) and RNPase P (10006626, IDT). Gel purified PCR products (200ng) are purified
and used in T7 (Roche 10881775001) in vitro transcription reaction. DNase is then added for
15mins, before the RNA is precipitated using standard ethanol RNA purification method (8).
Plate Preparation (PP):
PP1: Chemically synthesize ninety six forward barcoding primers (plate-specific barcode) and
ninety six reverse barcoding primers (well-specific barcode) (see sequences in Supplementary
Information), dissolved at a 10 µM concentration in RNase-free water. A total of 2.8 ml of each
primer is required for the full protocol (includes 20% extra volume due to pipetting error).
PP2: Aliquot 1 µl of every well-specific reverse primer into each well of a 96-well plate. Repeat
this step for ninety six individual 96-well plates. This will generate ninety six plates that contain
the same well-specific reverse barcoding primer in each respective well.
PP3: aliquot 1 µl of a single plate specific forward barcoding primer into each well of a single
specific 96-well plate from PS2. Repeat this step with a unique forward plate specific barcoding
primer per plate from PS2. These preparation steps generate ninety six 96-well plates (9,216
unique wells), with each well containing one plate-specific forward primer and one well-specific
reverse primer. PS2 and 3 can be repeated multiple times to optimize the procedure and
aliquoted plates stored at -20C before use.

on the side of the well, or under the well cap, and mixed with the sample by vortexing and/or

RS7: Place all the 96-well plates at 38o C for 2h.

RS8: Collect the REMBRANDT products from all the 96-well plates into a single container (each
96-well plate will yield 1.92 ml).
Note: next steps are referred to the handling of a single 96-well plate, but can be scaled-up as
needed.

The maximum yield/well is about 1µg of amplification product.

Since suggested

purification columns have a maximum capacity of 500 µg, up to 5 plates can be purified with one
column. Using a 20-spots vacuum manifold, the products of ninety six 96-well plates can be
purified simultaneously.

RS9: Add 5 volumes (9.6 ml) of DNA Binding Buffer. Mix well and load onto a Zymo-Spin VI
column. Place the column(s) on a vacuum manifold, turn on the vacuum source and let the
sample clear from the column (repeat this step up to 5 times). Add 5 ml of DNA wash Buffer.
Repeat the wash step. Leave the vacuum source on for additional 5 minutes to remove all the
wash buffer. Transfer the column into a 50 ml conical tube. Add 2 ml of water to the column and
wait 1 minute. Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 3 minutes and collect the eluted barcoded DNA.

RS10: If performing multiple plates/columns, combine the eluted barcoded DNA and label the
combination as “Batch 1”

RS11: Repeat steps RS1-10. Ideally the procedure can be repeated a total of 24 times. The
subsequent 1-24 Batches are individually used for library preparation, and SHOULD NOT be
combined until AFTER LIGATION (Library construction) with batch specific adapters.

Library construction (LC):
LC1: Before library construction, a fraction of each purified pool of barcoded products should be
examined using the Bioanalyzer to determine concentration and product size. The respective
size of the COVID-19 and RNase P product are 124 and 104 bp, respectively.

LC2: Using the Illumina library construction kit (e7490), start at protocol 1.6 and conduct End
repair on each pool of DNA fragments.

LC3: Proceed to Adaptor Ligation Step

LC4: Proceed to Purification of Ligation of Reaction step. This is critical to remove any free
adaptor that will add noise to the library construction.

LC5: PCR Enrichment of Ligation Reaction. We recommend using 8 cycles to minimize overamplification.

LC6: Purification of PCR reaction.

LC7: The overall library quality should be checked using a Bioanalyzer to confirm the size of the
DNA fragments. Libraries that contain detectable levels of Primer-Primer annealing events should
be repeated.

LC8: Determine the absolute DNA concentration of each library using Qubit.

Sequencing (S): The libraries are then loaded onto the Illumina sequencing platform and run as
per manufacturer’s instructions. Once complete, the dataset is downloaded onto a suitable
storage server for analysis.

Results: To establish the REMBRANDT protocol, whilst minimizing virus exposure, we amplified
a region of the SARS-CoV-2 N gene and the control human RNase P gene (RPP30) using PCR
(Figure 3A) using commercially available templates (COVID-19-N: 10006625, IDT and RNPase
P: 10006626, IDT). Each of the forward primers contained an extended region that coded for the
T7 polymerase binding site.

This site was then used to synthesize each RNA using T7

polymerase transcription that was then purified using ethanol precipitation. We then utilized
different dilutions of the RNase P RNA to identify specific conditions for the accurate and
reproducible amplification of this region using a combined Reverse Transcriptase-RecombinasePolymerase Amplification (RT-RPA) (Figure 3B). The optimized RT-RPA conditions were then
evaluated for the SARS-CoV-2 N amplicon, which were found to efficiently amplify this region
(Figure 3C). These results demonstrate that the REMBRANDT approach can directly rapidly
amplify RNA from the CDC-recommended control gene and SARS-CoV-2 N gene regions.
We then examined different combinations of barcoded SARS-CoV-2 N gene primers. We
found that 8 unique barcoded forward and 12 unique barcoded reverse primers efficiently
amplified the COVID-19 region.

From this analysis, we determined that our test primer

combinations could be utilized to detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Figure 3D). Following the
protocol described above, these barcoded DNA fragments can be rapidly assembled into a library
for standard RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq).
Unlike normal RNA-Seq runs that focus on mapping a small number of barcodes to a large
number of genes, our computational strategy simply demultiplexes large numbers of barcodes
and then maps them to three genes (Figure 4). In brief, we have developed a computational
framework that separates samples based on 3 sets of barcodes using a nested iteration from the
ShortRead Bioconductor package (9). The RNA-Seq fastq files are first imported into the R
environment using the FastqStreamer() function and the sequence information extracted using
the yield() function in FastqStreamer. For each read iteration, we use the grepl() string searching
function to identify input barcodes. If input barcodes are identified, the reads are placed in a new
fastq file using the writeFastq() function. The new fastq files are the input files for the next round
of iterations of inputting, string-searching, and splitting files using the next round of barcodes.
These process iterations start by de-multiplexing based on Illumina barcodes followed by platespecific barcodes followed by well-specific barcodes. This iterative approach can efficiently map
reads in to each unique barcode combination. Once complete, all of the reads are mapped to the
inputted control RNase P, SARS-CoV-2 N gene and control SARS-CoV-2 oligo using the
Rsubread Bioconductor package (10). The sequences of each of these amplicons are then
combined into a fasta file, and an index built using the buildIndex() function.

A Simplified

Annotation Format (SAF) file is also generated for these sequences. Using the align() function,
alongside our assembled indexes, we align our demultiplexed ‘fastq’ files to the control SARSCoV-2 N, Human RPP30, and SARS-CoV-2 N gene sequences. The counts per sequence are
then summarized from the resulting BAM alignment files using the featureCounts() function
alongside our SAF annotation file. We use the parLapply() function from the snow R package to
run large numbers of samples in parallel to maximize efficiency (11). The steps for this pipeline
are detailed in Figure 4.

Discussion and Conclusions:
SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious single-stranded RNA virus. However, increasing evidence
suggests that the vast majority of infected individuals display few or very mild symptoms (12).
These people may still spread the virus for over 20 days after the initial contagion (13). For this
reason, a key counter-measure against COVID-19 has been social distancing and city- or countrywide lockdowns.

This approach has significantly slowed the number of new cases in the

populations that practice these methods. Unfortunately, these lockdowns place real burdens on
residents, and are designed to be temporary measures.
The rapid identification and quarantining of infected individuals is a key measure to
containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Areas of the world such as South Korea and Northeastern
Italy that have quickly tested their population en masse for SARS-CoV-2 have significantly
reduced the spread of the disease.

The relatively low incidence and mortality from these

examples in comparison with adjacent countries and regions suggests that extensive population
testing will be important for the foreseeable future, as cities and countries re-open their
businesses and borders, to assess the COVID-19 status in real-time, at the community level (14).
One of the major current limitations of population testing is the availability of reagents
(swabs, viral transport medium, RNA isolation kits, probes and other molecular biology reagents).
The current clinical standard for COVID-19 diagnosis (qRT-PCR) requires suitable equipment for
the amplification of the viral RNA and the detection of the infection.

Each of these steps

significantly slows sample processing and limits the number of tests that can be performed in a
day. For this reason, new diagnostic tools are needed that are fast and efficient as well as
scalable to population sized numbers and based on readily available reagents.
To address this need, the scientific community has delivered a remarkable and
unprecedented number of assays to diagnose COVID-19. Several diagnostic approaches that
can provide fast and cheap tests have been developed. One of the leading approaches uses

blood tests to identify IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 proteins (15). These tests
show great promise. However, this assay can only examine the immunological status of the
patient and cannot determine the viral load in exhaled respiratory particles, the major source of
disease spread. These diagnostic kits will therefore be important to identify patients which may
have developed immunity against the virus, but are not appropriate to test the ability of a patient
to infect others.
A number of groups have been working to develop novel tools to detect the genetic
material of SARS-CoV-2 within patient airways. These approaches allow the preliminary detection
of potentially infected asymptomatic patients, whose diagnosis should be confirmed using
standard qRT-PCR. The different tests range from the quick and portable kits (16-17), with the
potential to become home-testing kits, to high-throughput multiplexed RT-PCR reactions. One
particularly promising approach uses viral RNA reverse transcription and patient-specific
barcoding of the single strand of cDNA, followed by cDNA amplification and NGS analysis (18).
This approach, although interesting, requires 1 barcode per patient rather than multiplexing
barcodes. Ultimately, that means to screen 10,000 patients one would require 10,000 barcodes.
In addition, these large primers with large barcodes are likely to vary significantly in their
amplification efficiency, making the individual testing of these primer sets essential.
REcombinase Mediated BaRcoding and AmplificatioN Diagnostic Tool (REMBRANDT)
builds on these principles to double barcode each patient sample using an isothermal RT-RPA
reaction. The combinatorial use of multiple forward and reverse barcodes, one per patient and
one per plate, enables 192 primers to generate 9,216 patient-specific combinations. This number
can then be further multiplexed and amplified with 12 Illumina barcodes utilized during library
construction to examine 110,952 patient samples in a single Illumina run. This simplified and
straightforward approach does not require specialized equipment for patient detection and library
construction.

We therefore have confidence that this system could be readily implemented in

most communities, including those with limited resources, provided the availability of partners

capable of NGS analysis. We are currently developing approaches to scale-up the production of
the recombinant RT-RPA enzymes for the management of the potential increase in their demand.
As REMBRANDT uses an isothermal RNA reverse transcription and amplification
reaction, it does not require PCR amplification. Moreover, since pairing of the template and primer
during the amplification step relies on the activity of recombinases UvsX and UvsY, it is minimally
affected by different Tm or Ta of the primers. The REMBRANDT pipeline also offers flexibility and
can be readily adapted to detect other viral genes, viruses and/or other pathogenic species, by
switching the design of the amplification primers.

The protocol described here provides

experimental evidence that the designed RT-RPA is effective in amplifying the synthetic SARSCoV-2 N-gene RNA. Although the clinical efficacy of this approach remains untested, isothermal
amplification has been previously used to detect SARS-CoV-2 levels in patients, from a number
of bodily fluids (19).
The detailed protocol and experimental results for the fast (less than 24h) concurrent
screening of over 100,000 potential COVID-19 samples as well as the framework to analyze NGS
sequencing data is fully described. When clinically validated, REMBRANDT may represent a
useful tool for screening easy-to-access bodily fluids for COVID-19 diagnosis.
