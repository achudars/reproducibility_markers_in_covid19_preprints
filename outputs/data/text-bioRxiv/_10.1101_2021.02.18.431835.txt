Abstract

16

Rotavirus, a segmented double-stranded RNA virus, is a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in

17

young children. The introduction of live oral rotavirus vaccines has reduced the incidence of

18

rotavirus disease in many countries. To explore the possibility of establishing a combined

19

rotavirus-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we generated recombinant (r)SA11 rotaviruses with modified

20

segment 7 RNAs that contained coding sequences for NSP3 and FLAG-tagged portions of the

21

SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. A 2A translational element was used to drive separate

22

expression of NSP3 and the S product. rSA11 viruses were recovered that encoded the S-protein

23

S1 fragment, N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD), extended receptor-

24

binding domain (ExRBD), and S2 core (CR) domain (rSA11/NSP3-fS1, -fNTD, -fRBD, -

25

fExRBD, and -fCR, respectively). Generation of rSA11/fS1 required a foreign-sequence

26

insertion of 2.2-kbp, the largest such insertion yet made into the rotavirus genome. Based on

27

isopycnic centrifugation, rSA11 containing S sequences were denser than wildtype virus,

28

confirming the capacity of the rotavirus to accommodate larger genomes. Immunoblotting

29

showed that rSA11/-fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD, and -fCR viruses expressed S products of

30

expected size, with fExRBD expressed at highest levels. These rSA11 viruses were genetically

31

stable during serial passage. In contrast, rSA11/NSP3-fS1 failed to express its expected 80-kDa

32

fS1 product, for unexplained reasons. Moreover, rSA11/NSP3-fS1 was genetically unstable, with

33

variants lacking the S1 insertion appearing during serial passage. Nonetheless, these results

34

emphasize the potential usefulness of rotavirus vaccines as expression vectors of portions of the

35

SARS-CoV-2 S protein (e.g., NTD, RBD, ExRBD, and CR) with sizes smaller than the S1

36

fragment.

Among the vaccines administered to children in the US and many other countries are those

targeting rotavirus, a segmented double-stranded RNA virus that is a major cause of severe

by reverse genetics, such that the virus could serve as an expression vector of the SARS-CoV-2

INTRODUCTION
The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on human

52

mortality and morbidity has stimulated broad ranging efforts to develop vaccines preventing

53

coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) (1,2). Given that the virus can cause asymptomatic and

54

symptomatic infections in individuals of all ages, including infants and young children,

55

comprehensive strategies to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may require modification of

56

childhood immunization programs to include COVID-19 vaccines (3,4). Among the vaccines

57

routinely administered to infants in the US and many other countries, are those targeting

58

rotavirus, a segmented double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus that is a primary cause of severe

59

acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children during the first 5 years of life (5). The most widely used

60

rotavirus vaccines are given orally and formulated from live attenuated virus strains (6). These

61

vaccines induce the production of neutralizing IgG and IgA antibodies (7,8,9) and have been

62

highly effective in reducing the incidence of rotavirus hospitalizations and mortality (10,11).

63

Advances in rotavirus reverse genetics technologies have allowed the generation of

64

recombinant rotaviruses that serve as expression platforms of heterologous proteins (12-19). The

65

rotavirus genome consists of 11 segments of dsRNA, with a total size of ~18.6 kbp for group A

66

strains (rotavirus species A) typically associated with pediatric AGE (20). Most of the genome

67

segments contain a single open-reading frame (ORF); these encode the 6 structural (VP1-VP4,

68

VP6-VP7) or 6 nonstructural (NSP) viral proteins (21). The recently-developed rotavirus reverse

69

genetics systems consist of eleven T7 transcription (pT7) vectors, each directing synthesis of a

70

unique viral (+)RNA when transfected into baby-hamster kidney cells producing T7 RNA

71

polymerase (BHK-T7 cells). In some cases, support plasmids expressing capping enzymes

72

[African swine fever virus NP868R (22) or vaccinia virus D1L/D12R (18)] or fusion proteins

73

[avian reovirus p10FAST (18)] are co-transfected with the pT7 vectors to enhance recovery of

74

recombinant viruses. Rotavirus reverse genetics systems have been used to mutate several of the

75

viral genome segments and to generate virus strains that express reporter proteins (13,17,23-26).

76

Genome segment 7 of group A rotaviruses encodes NSP3 (36 kDa), an RNA-binding

77

protein that acts a translation enhancer of viral (+)RNAs and is expressed at moderate levels in

78

infected cells (27,28). In a previous study, we showed that the single NSP3 ORF could be re-

79

engineered by reverse genetics to express two separate proteins through placement of a

80

teschovirus 2A translational stop-restart element at the end of the NSP3 ORF, followed by the

81

coding sequence for a heterologous protein (17). Through this approach, well-growing

82

genetically-stable recombinant rotaviruses have been generated that express NSP3 and one or

83

more fluorescent proteins (FPs) [e.g., mRuby (red), UnaG (green), TagBFP (blue), etc.] from

84

segment 7, an advance allowing study of rotavirus biology by live cell imaging (15). The NSP3

85

product of these recombinant viruses is functional, capable of dimerization and inducing the

86

nuclear accumulation of the cellular poly(A)-binding protein (16,17). Thus, recombinant

87

rotaviruses that express foreign proteins via addition of a 2A element and coding sequence into

88

segment 7 downstream of the NSP3 ORF retain the full complement of functional viral ORFs.

89

As a step towards developing a combined rotavirus-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we explored

90

the possibility of generating recombinant rotaviruses that express regions of the SARS-CoV-2

91

spike (S) protein through re-engineering of the NSP3 ORF in segment 7. Trimers of the S protein

92

form crown-like projections that emanate from the lipid envelop surrounding the SARS-CoV-2

93

virion (29,30). Cleavage of the trimeric spikes by extracellular furin-like proteases generates S1

94

and S2 fragments, each which possess activities essential for virus entry (Fig. 1). The S1

95

fragment includes an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a receptor-binding domain (RBD), the latter

96

mediating virus interaction with the cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2

97

(ACE2) (31). The S2 fragment is responsible for S-protein trimerization and contains fusion

98

domains that are essential for virus entry. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies with neutralizing

99

activity have been mapped to various regions of the S protein, including the NTD, RBD, and

100

fusion domains (32-35). We determined that by inserting S coding sequences into rotavirus

101

genome segment 7 downstream of the NSP3 ORF and a 2A element, well-growing genetically-

102

stable recombinant rotaviruses can be made that express all or portions of the S1 and S2

103

fragment. These findings raise the possibility of constructing rotavirus vaccine strains that are

104

not only capable of inducing immunological protective responses against rotavirus, but also

105

COVID-19.

107

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

108

Modified segment 7 (NSP3) expression vectors containing SARS-CoV-2 S sequences.

109

To examine the possibility of using rotavirus as an expression platform for regions of the SARS-

110

CoV-2 S protein, we replaced the NSP3 ORF in the pT7/NSP3SA11 transcription vector with a

111

cassette comprised of the NSP3 ORF, a porcine teschovirus 2A element, and a coding sequence

112

of the S protein (Fig. 2). The cassette included a flexible GAG hinge between the coding

113

sequence for NSP3 and the 2A element and a 3x FLAG (f) tag between the coding sequences for

114

the 2A element and the S region. This approach was used to generate a set of vectors

115

(collectively referred to as pT7/NSP3-CoV2/S vectors) that contained coding sequences for

116

SARS-CoV-2 S1 (pT7/NSP3-2A-fS1), NTD (pT7/NSP3-2A-fNTD), RBD (pT7/NSP3-2A-

117

fRBD), an extended form of the RBD (ExRBD) (pT7/NSP3-2A-fExRBD), and the S2 core

118

region (CR) including its fusion domains (pT7/NSP3-2A-fCR) (Fig. 1). The S sequences were

119

inserted into the pT7/NSP3SA11 vector at the same site as used before in the production of

120

recombinant SA11 (rSA11) rotaviruses expressing FPs (15-17).

121

Recovery of rSA11 rotaviruses with segment 7 dsRNA containing S sequences. To

122

generate rSA11 viruses, BHK-T7 monolayers were transfected with a complete set of pT7/SA11

123

expression vectors, except pT7/NSP3SA11 was replaced with a pT7/NSP3-CoV2/S vector, and a

124

CMV expression plasmid (pCMV-NP868R) encoding the capping enzyme of African swine

125

fever virus. In transfection mixtures, plasmids encoding rotavirus NSP2 (pT7/NSP2SA11) and

126

NSP5 (pT7/NSP5SA11) were included at levels three-fold greater than the other pT7/SA11

127

vectors. BHK-T7 cells were overseeded with MA104 cells two days following transfection. The

128

BHK-T7/MA104 cell mixture was freeze-thawed three days later, and the rSA11 viruses were

129

recovered by plaque isolation and amplified by 1 or 2 cycles of growth in MA104 cells prior to

130

characterization (36). Properties of the rSA11 viruses are summarized in Table 1.

131

Based on gel electrophoresis, rSA11 viruses generated with pT7/NSP3-S vectors

132

(collectively referred to as rSA11/NSP3-CoV2/S viruses) contained segment 7 dsRNAs that

133

were much larger than that of wildtype rSA11 (rSA11/wt) virus (Fig. 3). Sequence analysis

134

confirmed that the segment 7 dsRNAs of the rSA11/NSP3-CoV2/S viruses matched the segment

135

7 sequences present in the pT7/NSP3-CoV2/S vectors (data not shown). The re-engineered

136

segment 7 dsRNA of virus isolate rSA11/NSP3-fS1 had a length of 3.3 kbp, accounting for its

137

electrophoretic migration near the largest rotavirus genome segment (segment 1), which is

138

likewise 3.3 kbp in length (Table 1, Fig. 3A). The segment 7 dsRNA of rSA11/NSP3-fS1

139

contains a 2.2-kbp foreign sequence insertion, the longest foreign sequence that has been

140

introduced into the segment 7 dsRNA, or for that matter, any rotavirus genome segment. The

141

previously longest 7 dsRNA engineered into rSA11 was the 2.4-kbp segment 7 dsRNA of

142

rSA11/NSP3-fmRuby-P2A-fUnaG, which contained a cassette that encoded three proteins

143

(NSP3, UnaG, mRuby) (17). The total genome size of rSA11/NSP3-fS1 is 20.8 kbp, 12% greater

144

than that of rSA11/wt (37). This is the largest genome known to exist within a rotavirus isolate

145

and demonstrates the capacity of rotavirus to replicate and package large amounts of foreign

146

sequence.

147

The segment 7 dsRNAs of virus isolates, rSA11/NSP3-fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD, and -

148

fCR, were determined to have lengths of 2.1, 1.8, 2.1, and 2.3 kbp, respectively (Table 1), and as

149

expected from their sizes, migrated on RNA gels between rotavirus genome segments 3 (2.6 kbp)

150

and 5 (1.6 kbp) (Fig. 3). The segment 7 dsRNAs of the rSA11/NSP3-fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD,

151

and -fCR isolates contained foreign sequence insertions of 1.0, 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 kbp,

152

respectively, significantly smaller that the 2.1 kBP foreign sequence insertion of rSA11/NSP3-

153

fS1. The smaller sizes of the foreign-sequence insert in the segment 7 RNAs of rSA11/NSP3-

154

fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD, and -fCR provide additional genetic space that can be used to add

155

routing and localization signals to S protein products, which may enhance their antigen

156

processing and presentation, recognition by T cells, and trafficking to immune cells. For

157

example, the extra genetic space can be used to add an N-terminal ER trafficking signal and a C-

158

terminal plasma-membrane localization signal to the ExRBD, along with internal coiled-coil

159

cassettes, that may favor surface presentation of a multimerized form of the ExRBD capable of

160

inducing enhanced production of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.

161

Consistent with previous studies examining the phenotypes of rSA11 isolates expressing

162

FPs (16-17), the sizes of plaques formed by rSA11/NSP3-CoV2/S viruses were smaller than

163

plaques formed by rSA11/wt. Similarly, rSA11 viruses containing S-protein coding sequences

164

grew to maximum titers that were up to 0.5-1 log lower than rSA11/wt. The reason for the

165

smaller plaques and lower titers of the rSA11/NSP3-CoV2/S viruses is unknown, but may reflect

166

the longer elongation time likely required for the viral RNA polymerase to transcribe their

167

segment 7 dsRNAs during viral replication. Alternatively, it may reflect the longer time required

168

to translate segment 7 (+)RNAs that contain S-protein coding sequences.

169

Expression of S coding sequences by rSA11 rotaviruses. To determine whether the

170

rSA11/NSP3-CoV2/S viruses expressed products from their S sequences, lysates prepared from

171

MA104 cells infected with these viruses were examined by immunoblot assay using FLAG- and

172

RBD-specific antibodies (Fig. 4A, B). Immunoblots probed with FLAG antibody showed that

173

rSA11/NSP3-fNTD, -fExRBD, -fRBD, and -fCR viruses generated S products and that their

174

sizes were as predicted for an active 2A element in the segment 7 ORF: fNTD (34.8 kDa),

175

fExRBD (35.2 kDa), fRBD (24.3 kDa), and fCR (42.9 kDa) (Table 1). Immunoblot assays

176

indicated that the rSA11/NSP3-fExRBD yielded higher levels of S product than any of the other

177

rSA11/NSP3-CoV2/S viruses. The basis for the higher levels of the fExRBD product is unclear,

178

but does not correlate with increased levels of expression of other viral products, such as NSP3

179

and VP6. Nonetheless, the high levels of ExRBD expression by rSA11/NSP3-fExRBD suggests

180

that such viruses may be best suited in pursing the development of combined rotavirus/COVID

181

vaccines.

182

FLAG antibody did not detect the expected 79.6-kDa fS1 product in cells infected with

183

rSA11/NSP3-fS1 (Fig. 4A). The S1 coding sequence in the segment 7 ORF includes an N-

184

terminal signal sequence which, in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, is cleaved from the S1 protein

185

during synthesis on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (29,38). Cleavage of the signal sequence

186

may have removed the upstream 3x FLAG tag from a S1 product, preventing its detection by the

187

FLAG antibody. It is also possible that glycosylation and/or degradation of the 79.6 kDa-S1

9

188

product by ER-associated proteases may have prevented the protein's detection. In addition,

189

rotavirus which usurps and possibly remodels the ER in support of glycoprotein (NSP4 and VP7)

190

synthesis and virus morphogenesis may perturb ER-interaction with the S signal sequence in

191

such a way to prevent S1 synthesis (21). Interestingly, all the rSA11/NSP3-CoV2/S viruses,

192

including rSA11/NSP3-fS1, generated 2A read-through products that were detectable using

193

FLAG antibody. Thus, the 2A stop-start element in the rSA11/NSP3-2A-CoV2/S viruses was not

194

fully active, which is consistent with previous reports analyzing the functionality of 2A elements

195

within cells (39-41). However, with the exception of the rSA11/NSP3-fS1, all the viruses

196

generated more 2A-cleaved S product than read-through product. Mutation of residues in and

197

around the 2A element, including the inclusion of flexible linker sequences, may decrease the

198

relative frequency of read through (42-43).

199

Lysates from MA104 cells infected with rSA11/wt, rSA11/NSP3-fRBD, and

200

rSA11/NSP3-fExRBD were also probed with a RBD-specific polyclonal antibody prepared

201

against a peptide mapping to the C-terminal end of the RBD domain (ProSci 9087). The RBD

202

antibody recognized the fExRBD product of the rSA11/NSP3-fExRBD virus, but not the fRBD

203

product of rSA11/NSP3-fRBD (Fig. 4B), presumably because the latter product lacked the

204

peptide sequence used in generating the ProSci RBD antibody. To gain insight into whether the

205

fRBD and fExRBD products folded into native structures mimicking those present in the SARS-

206

CoV-2 S protein, lysates prepared from MA104 cells infected with rSA11/NSP3-fRBD and

207

rSA11/NSP3-fExRBD were probed by pulldown assay using an anti-RBD conformation-

208

dependent neutralizing monoclonal antibody (GeneTex CR3022). As shown in Fig. 4C, the

209

CR3022 immunoprecipitate included fExRBD, indicating that this product included a

210

neutralizing epitope found in authentic SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Thus, at least some of the RBD

10

211

product of rSA11/NSP3-fExRBD has likely folded in a conformation capable of inducing a

212

protective antibody response. Unlike the successful pulldown of ExRBD with CR3022 antibody,

213

it was not clear if the antibody likewise immunoprecipitated the fRBD product of rSA11/NSP3-

214

fRBD. This uncertainty stems from the light chain of the CR3022 antibody obscuring the

215

electrophoretically closely-migrating fRBD product in immunoblot assays (Fig. 4C).

216

Expression of the ExRBD and RBD products by rSA11s during rotavirus infection.

217

To gain insight into fExRBD and fRBD expression during virus replication, MA104 cells were

218

infected with rSA11/wt, rSA11/NSP3-fExRBD or rSA11/NSP3-fRBD and then harvested at

219

intervals between 0 and 12 hr p.i. Analysis of the infected cell lysates by immunoblot assay

220

showed that fExRBD and fRBD were readily detectable by 4 h p.i., paralleling the expression of

221

rotavirus proteins NSP3 and VP6 (Fig. 5). Increased levels of fExRBD and fRBD were present at

222

8 and 12 h p.i., without obvious accumulation of FLAG-tagged products of smaller sizes. Thus,

223

the fExRBD and fRBD products appear to be relatively stable.

224

Density of rSA11 virus particles containing S sequences. The introduction of S

225

sequences into the rSA11/NSP3-CoV2/S viruses increased the size of their viral genomes by 1.0

226

to 2.5 kbp beyond that of SA11/wt. Assuming the rSA11/NSP3-CoV2/S viruses are packaged

227

efficiently and contain a complete constellation of 11 genome segments, the increased content of

228

dsRNA within the core of rSA11/NSP3-CoV2/S particles should cause their densities to be

229

greater than that of SA11/wt particles. To explore this possibility, rSA11/wt (18.6-kbp genome),

230

rSA11/NSP3-fExRBD (19.5 kbp) and rSA11/NSP3-fS1 (20.8 kbp) were amplified in MA104

231

cells. The infected-cell lysates were then treated with EDTA to convert rotavirus virions (triple-

232

layered particles) into double-layered particles (DLPs). The particles were centrifuged to

233

equilibrium on CsCl gradients (Fig. 6) and the density of the DLP bands determined by

refractometry. The analysis indicated that the density of rSA11/NSP3-fExRBD DLPs (1.386

235

g/cm3) was greater than SA11/wt DLPs (1.381 g/cm3) (panel A) and similarly, the density of

236

rSA11/NSP3-fS1 DLPs (1.387 g/cm3) was greater that SA11/wt DLPs (1.38 g/cm3) (panel B).

237

Analysis of the banded DLPs by gel electrophoresis confirmed that they contained the expected

238

constellation of eleven genome segments. To confirm that the density of rSA11/NSP3-fS1 DLPs

239

was different that rSA11/wt DLPs, infected-cell lysates containing each of these viruses were

240

pooled, treated with EDTA, and the viral DLPs in the combined sample banded by centrifugation

241

on a CsCl gradient (Fig. 6, panel E). Analysis of the gradient revealed the presence of two bands

242

of particles, indicating that rSA11/NSP3-fSA11-fS1 and rSA11/wt DLPs were of different

243

densities. Gel electrophoresis of the combined DLP bands showed, as expected, that both

244

rSA11/NSP3-fSA11-fS1 and rSA11/wt were present. Taken together, these results demonstrate

245

that rSA11/NSP3-CoV-2/S virions contain complete genome constellations despite the fact that

246

their genome sizes are significantly greater than that of wildtype SA11 virus. Indeed, the 20.8-

247

kbp rSA11/NSP3-fS1 genome is 12% greater in size than the 18.6-kbp rSA11/wt genome (Table

248

1). Thus, the rotavirus core has space to accommodate large amounts of additional foreign

249

sequence. How the dsRNA within the core is re-distributed to accommodate large amounts of

250

additional sequence is not known, but clearly the core remains a transcriptionally-active

251

nanomachine despite the additional sequence. Whether other genome segments can be

252

engineered similarly to segment 7 of rSA11/NSP3-fS1 to include 2 kb of additional sequence

253

remains to be determined. The maximum packaging capacity of the core also remains to be

254

determined.

257

MA104 cells infected with 1:1000 dilutions of cell lysates at each round. Electrophoretic analysis

258

of the dsRNAs recovered from cells infected with rSA11/NSP3-fNTD, -fRBD, -ExRBD, or -

259

ExCR showed no changes in the sizes of any of the 11 genome segments over 5 rounds of

260

passage (P1-P5), including segment 7, indicating that these viruses were genetically stable. In

261

contrast, serial passage of rSA11/NSP3-S1 showed evidence of instability. By the third round of

262

passage, novel genome segments were appearing that were smaller than the 3.3-kbp segment 7

263

RNA. With continued passage, four novel segments (R-1 to R-4) became prominent and the 3.3-

264

kbp segment 7 RNA was no longer detectable, suggesting that the high-passage virus pools (P3-

265

P6) were populated by variants containing segment 7 RNAs derived from the 3.3-kb segment 7

266

RNA through internal sequence deletion. To evaluate this possibility, 8 variants were recovered

267

from the P6 virus pool by plaque isolation, 4 with a large (L) plaque phenotype and 4 with a

268

small (S) plaque phenotype. Electrophoretic analysis of the genomes of the variants showed that

269

none contained the 3.3-kbp segment 7 RNA. Instead, 6 variants (L1, L2, L3, L4, S2, and S4)

270

contained the R3 segment, and the other two variants contained either the R1 (S1) or R2 (R2)

271

segment. No variants were recovered that contained the novel R4 segment. Sequencing showed

272

that the R1, R2, and R3 segments were in fact derivatives of the 3.3-kbp segment 7 RNA. The

273

R1, R2, and R3 RNAs all retained the complete 5'- and 3'-UTRs and NSP3 ORF of segment 7,

274

but contained sequence deletions of 1.0 (R1), 1.5 (R2), or 1.8 (R3) kbp of S1 coding sequence.

275

The fact that 6 of the 8 variants isolated by plaque assay contained the R3 segment suggests that

276

variants with this RNA may have a growth advantage over variants with the R1, R2, or R4

277

RNAs. Although genetic instability gave rise to rSA11/NSP3-fS1 variants lacking portions of the

278

S1 ORF, none were identified that lacked portions of the NSP3 ORF. This suggests that NSP3

279

may be essential for virus replication, which would explain the failure of previous efforts by us

281

282

Summary. We have shown that reverse genetics can be used to generate recombinant

283

rotaviruses that express, as separate products, portions of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, including

284

its immunodominant RBD. These results indicate that it may be possible to develop rotaviruses

285

as vaccine expression vectors, providing a path for generating oral live-attenuated rotavirus-

286

COVID-19 combination vaccines able to induce immunological protective responses against

287

both rotavirus and SARS-CoV-2. Such combination vaccines would be designed for use in

288

infants and young children and would allow the widespread distribution and administration of

289

COVID-19-targeted vaccines by piggy backing onto current rotavirus immunization programs

290

used in the USA and many other countries, both developed and developing. In addition, our

291

findings raise the possibility that through the use of rotavirus as vaccine expression platforms,

292

rotavirus-based combination vaccines could be made against other enteric viruses including

293

norovirus, astrovirus, and hepatitis E virus.

294

We have determined that the 18.6-kbp rotavirus dsRNA can accommodate as much as

295

2.2-kbp of foreign sequence, which is sufficient to encode the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein.

296

However, in our hands, rSA11s encoding S1 were not genetically stable and failed to express the

297

appropriate S1 product, for reasons that are uncertain but under further investigation. Rotaviruses

298

carrying large amounts of foreign sequence are characteristically genetically unstable (this study

299

and data not shown), but those with foreign sequences of <1.0-1.5-kbp are stable over 5-10

300

rounds of serial passage at low MOI and, thus, can be developed into vaccine candidates . The

301

coding capacity provided by 1.0-1.5-kbp of extra sequence is sufficient to produce recombinant

302

rotaviruses that encode the SARS-CoV-2 NTD, RBD, or S2 core along with trafficking signals

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture. Embryonic monkey kidney cells (MA104) were grown in medium 199

309

(M199) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Baby hamster

310

kidney cells expressing T7 RNA polymerase (BHK-T7) were provided by Dr. Ulla Buchholz,

311

Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, NIAID, NIH, and were propagated in Glasgow minimum

312

essential media (GMEM) containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10%

313

tryptone-peptide broth, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 2% non-essential amino acids, and 1%

314

glutamine (36). BHK-T7 cells were grown in medium supplemented with 2% Geneticin

315

(Invitrogen) with every other passage.

316

Plasmid construction. Recombinant SA11 rotaviruses were prepared using the plasmids

317

pT7/VP1SA11, pT7/VP2SA11, pT7/VP3SA11, pT7/VP4SA11, pT7/VP6SA11, pT7/VP7SA11,

318

pT7/NSP1SA11, pT7/NSP2SA11, pT7/NSP3SA11, pT7/NSP4SA11, and pT7/NSP5SA11

319

[https://www.addgene.org/Takeshi_Kobayashi/] and pCMV-NP868R (16). The plasmid

320

pT7/NSP3-P2A-fUnaG was produced, as described elesewhere, by fusing a DNA fragment

321

containing the ORF for P2A-3xFL-UnaG to the 3'-end of the NSP3 ORF in pT7/NSP3SA11

322

(17). A plasmid (pTWIST/COVID19spike) containing a full-length cDNA of the SARS-CoV-2 S

323

gene (GenBank MN908947.3) was purchased from Twist Bioscience. The plasmids pT7/NSP3-

324

2A-fNTD, pT7/NSP3-2A-fExRBD, pT7/NSP3-2A-fRBD, pT7/NSP3-2A-fCR, and pT7/NSP3-

325

2A-S1 were made by replacing the UnaG ORF in pT7/NSP3-2A-fUnaG with ORFs for the NTD,

ExRBD, RBD, CR, and S1 regions, respectively, of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, by In-Fusion

327

cloning. DNA fragments containing NTD, ExRBD, RBD, CR, and S1 coding sequences were

328

amplified from pTWIST/COVID19spike using the primer pairs NTD_For and NTD_Rev,

329

ExRBD_For and ExRBD_Rev, RBD_For and RBD_Rev, CR_For and CR_Rev, and S1_For and

330

331

(www.plasmid.com) or using Qiagen plasmid purification kits. Primers were provided by and

332

sequences determined by EuroFins Scientific.

333

Recombinant viruses. The reverse genetics protocol used to generate recombinant

334

rotaviruses was described in detail previously (16,44). To summarize, BHK-T7 cells were

335

transfected with SA11 pT7 plasmids and pCMV-NP868R using Mirus TransIT-LT1 transfection

336

reagent. Two days later, the transfected cells were overseeded with MA104 cells and the growth

337

medium (serum-free) adjusted to a final concentration of 0.5 g/ml trypsin. Three days later, the

338

BHK-T7/MA104 cell mixture was freeze-thawed 3-times and the lysates clarified by low-speed

339

centrifugation. Recombinant virus in clarified lysates were amplified by one or two rounds of

340

passage in MA104 cells maintained in serum-free medium containing 0.5 g/ml trypsin.

341

Individual virus isolates were obtained by plaque purification and typically amplified 1 or 2

342

rounds in MA104 cells prior to analysis. Viral dsRNAs were recovered from infected-cell lysates

343

by Trizol extraction, resolved by electrophoresis on Novex 8% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen)

344

in Tris-glycine buffer, and detected by staining with ethidium bromide. Viral dsRNAs in gels

345

were visualized using a BioRad ChemiDoc MP Imaging System. The genetic stability of plaque

346

isolated rSA11s was assessed by serial passage as described previously (17).

351

inhibitor cocktail (Roche cOmplete)]. For immunoblot assays, lysates were resolved by

352

electrophoresis on Novex linear 8-16% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose

353

membranes. After blocking with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% non-fat dry milk, blots

358

peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies: horse anti-mouse IgG (CST), anti-guinea

359

pig IgG (KPL), or goat anti-rabbit IgG (CST). Signals were developed using Clarity Western

360

ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad) and detected using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc imaging system.

Immunoprecipitation assay. Mock-infected and infected cell lysates were prepared as

362

above. Lysates were mixed with a SARS-CoV-2 S1 specific monoclonal antibody (GeneTex

363

CR3022, 1:150 dilution) or an NSP2 monoclonal antibody (#171, 1:200). After incubation at 4C

364

with gentle rocking for 18 h, antigen-antibody complexes were recovered using Pierce magnetic

365

IgA/IgG beads (ThermoFisher Scientific), resolved by gel electrophoresis, and blotted onto

366

nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with FLAG antibody (1:2000) to detect fRBD and

Figure 3. Properties of rSA11/NSP3-CoV2/S viruses expressing regions of the SARSCoV-2 S protein. (A and B) dsRNA was recovered from MA104 cells infected with plaquepurified rSA11 isolates, resolved by gel electrophoresis, and detected by ethidium-bromide
staining. RNA segments of rSA11/wt are labeled 1 to 11. Sizes (kbp) of segment 7 RNAs
(black arrows) of rSA11 isolates are indicated. Double-stranded RNA of rSA11/NSP3-fS1
serially passaged twice (P1 and P2) in MA104 cells is shown in (A). (C) Plaque assays were
performed using MA104 cells and detected by crystal-violet staining. (D) Titers reached by
rSA11 isolates were determined by plaque assay. Bars indicate standard deviations calculated
from three separate determinations.

Figure 4. Expression of SARS-CoV-2 S products by rSA11 viruses. (A, B) Whole cell lysates (WCL)
were prepared from cells infected with rSA11 viruses and examined by immunoblot assay using (A)
FLAG antibody to detect S products (NTD, ExRBD, RBD, CR, S1, and 2A read-through products) and
antibodies specific for rotavirus NSP3 and VP6 and cellular PCNA. Red asterisks identify 2A readthrough products and blue asterisks identify 2A cleavage products. (B) Lysates prepared from MA104
cells infected with rSA11wt, rSA11/NSP3-fRBD and rSA11/NSP3-fExRBD were examined by
immunoblot assay using antibodies specific for RBD (ProSci 9087), rotavirus VP6, and PCNA. (C)
Lysates prepared from MA104 cells infected with rSA11/wt, rSA11/NSP3-fRBD and rSA11/NSP3fExRBD viruses were examined by immunoprecipitation assay using a SARS-CoV-2 S1 specific
monoclonal antibody (GeneTex CR3022). Lysates were also analyzed with a NSP2-specific polyclonal
antibody. Antigen-antibody complexes were recovered using IgA/G beads, resolved by gel
electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with FLAG (fRBD and fExRBD)
and NSP2 antibody. Molecular weight markers are indicated (kDa). Red arrows indicate fRBD and
fExRBD. fRBD comigrates near the Ig light chain (Ig/L). Ig heavy chain, Ig/H).

Figure 6. Impact of genome size on rotavirus particle density. MA104 cells were infected with
rSA11/wt, rSA11/NSP3-fExRBD, or rSA11/NSP3-fS1 viruses at an MOI of 5. At 12 h p.i., the cells
were recovered, lysed by treatment with non-ionic detergent, and treated with EDTA to convert
rotavirus virions into DLPs. (A, B) DLPs were banded by centrifugation in CsCl gradients and their
densities (g/cm3) determined using a refractometer. (C) Lysates from rSA11/wt and rSA11/NSP3-fS1
infected cells were combined and their DLP components banded by centrifugation in a CsCl gradient.
(D,E) Electrophoretic profile of the dsRNA genomes of DLPs recovered from CsCl gradients. Panel D
RNAs derive from DLPs in panel A and panel E RNAs derive from DLPs in panel B and C. RNA
segments of rSA11/wt are labeled 1 to 11. Positions of segment 7 RNAs are indicated with red arrows.

Figure 7. Genetic stability of rSA11 strains expressing SARS-CoV-2 S domains. rSA11 strains were
serially passaged 5 to 6 times (P1 to P5 or P6) in MA104 cells. (A) Genomic RNAs were recovered from
infected cell lysates and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Positions of viral genome segments are labeled.
Position of modified segment 7 (NSP3) dsRNAs introduced into rSA11 strains are denoted with black
arrows. Genetic instability of the modified segment 7 (NSP3) dsRNA of rSA11/NSP3-fS1 yielded R1-R4
RNAs during serial passage. (B) Genomic RNAs prepared from large (L1-L4) and small (S1-S4) plaque
isolates of P6 rSA11/NSP3-fS1. Segment 7 RNAs are identified as R1-R3, as in (A). (C) Organization of
R1-R3 sequences determined by sequencing of segment 7 RNAs of L1, S1, and S3 plaque isolates.
Sequence deletions are indicated with dashed lines. Regions of the S1 ORF that are no longer encoded by
the R1-R3 segment 7 RNAs are indicated by slashed green-white boxes.
