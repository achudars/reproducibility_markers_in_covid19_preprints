SUMMARY

2

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in 2019 as the causative agent

3

of the novel pandemic viral disease COVID-19. With no approved therapies, this pandemic illustrates the

4

urgent need for safe, broad-spectrum antiviral countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging

5

CoVs. We report that remdesivir (RDV), a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog,

6

potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells and primary human airway epithelial

7

cultures (EC50 = 0.01 µM). Weaker activity was observed in Vero E6 cells (EC50 = 1.65 µM) due to their

8

low capacity to metabolize RDV. To rapidly evaluate in vivo efficacy, we engineered a chimeric SARS-

9

CoV encoding the viral target of RDV, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, of SARS-CoV-2. In mice

10

infected with chimeric virus, therapeutic RDV administration diminished lung viral load and improved

11

pulmonary function as compared to vehicle treated animals. These data provide evidence that RDV is

INTRODUCTION

19

Coronaviruses (CoV) are genetically diverse positive sense RNA viruses that circulate in animals and

20

humans. In the past 20 years, three new human CoV have emerged: severe acute respiratory syndrome

21

CoV (SARS-CoV-1) in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in 2012 and current

22

pandemic SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 (de Wit et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2020b).

23

While four endemic human CoV (HCoV-OC43, -229E, -NL63, and -HKU1) typically cause mild

24

respiratory diseases with common cold-like symptoms, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2

25

cause severe respiratory disease with respective mortality rates of 11% (Chan-Yeung and Xu, 2003), 35%

26

(Arabi et al., 2017), and an estimated 3% (Chen, 2020). The development of effective broad-spectrum

27

antivirals has been hampered by viral diversity, the capacity of CoVs to adaptively overcome negative

28

selective pressures, and the ability to actively counteract drugs through the action of a proofreading

29

exoribonuclease. We previously reported that remdesivir (RDV), a monophosphoramidate prodrug of the

30

C-adenosine analog GS-441524, potently inhibits replication of a broad spectrum of pre-pandemic bat

31

CoVs and human epidemic CoVs in primary human lung cell cultures (Agostini et al., 2018; Brown et al.,

32

2019; Sheahan et al., 2017). Biochemical analysis of the mechanism of inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2,

33

SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) revealed that incorporation of

34

the active metabolite RDV triphosphate (RDV-TP) was more efficient than the natural substrate ATP and

35

led to delayed chain termination three nucleotides downstream of incorporation (Gordon et al., 2020a,

36

2020b). Prolonged passaging of murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a group 2a CoV, in the presence of GS-

37

441524 resulted in low level resistance through mutations in the RdRp, further implicating this protein as

38

the drug target (Agostini et al., 2018). RDV showed both prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in mouse

39

models of SARS and MERS and against MERS-CoV challenge in a rhesus macaque model (Sheahan et

40

al., 2017, 2020a; Wit et al., 2020). Here we report that RDV potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication

41

Calu3 human lung cells with sub-micromolar EC50 and in primary human airway epithelial cultures

42

(HAEs) with nanomolar EC50. Notably, we have detected comparably lower potency of RDV in

43

established human and monkey cell lines due to their lower metabolic capacity to activate the compound.

44

Mice infected with chimeric SARS-CoV-1 encoding the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and treated therapeutically

45

with RDV show decreased viral loads in the lungs and increased pulmonary function. These data

46

emphasize the potential of RDV as a promising countermeasure against the ongoing COVID-19

pandemic.

RESULTS

50

Structural model of remdesivir incorporation by the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase and conservation of

51

the active site across human CoV. Drug function and performance is heavily influenced by

52

microvariation in target genes across virus families, biodistribution in the organism, and, importantly,

53

host cell and tissue expression patterns that influence drug stability and metabolism. We previously

54

modeled RDV on a homology model of SARS-CoV-2 based on the cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-1

55

polymerase complex (Gordon et al., 2020b; Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019). Composed of nsp12, nsp7 and

56

nsp8, the model was consistent with biochemical findings predicting efficient incorporation of RDV-TP

57

into the growing RNA strand and provided an explanation for the observed delayed chain termination

58

after the incorporation of three additional nucleotides. We have since refined this model using the recently

59

released cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex (Gao et al., 2020). The major

60

qualitative change is a more complete picture of the N-terminal NiRAN domain of nsp12, which was not

61

resolved in the SARS-CoV-1 structure. The current model of the pre-incorporation state, with RDV-TP,

62

RNA primer and template strands and catalytic metals was well-optimized with a series of constrained

63

energy minimizations and conformational searches, as described previously (Fig. 1A). Bound to the two

64

catalytic Mg2+ ions, RDV-TP is coordinated by two basic residues (R553 and R555). The ribose 2’OH

65

forms hydrogen bonds to T680 and N691, and the 1’CN resides in a shallow pocket formed by T687 and

66

A688 (Fig. 1B). The interaction with T680 distinguishes CoVs from other structurally related families,

67

including noroviruses, picornaviruses, and the flaviviruses. While key residues including D623, S682, and

68

N691, are conserved across all these virus families and have been shown to govern positioning of the

69

NTP into the active site, the role of T680 appears to be novel. While writing this manuscript, another

70

model of RDV-TP in the SARS-CoV-2 active site (Shannon et al., 2020) was published which predicts a

71

role for S682 as well. The position of T680 relative to N691 strongly implies it will contribute to the

72

recognition of the ribose 2’OH, likely diminishing the role of S682 as a result, consistent with earlier

73

predictions (Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019).

74

Modeling of the RDV resistance mutations identified in MHV (Agostini et al., 2018) onto homologous

75

residues V557 and F480 in the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp structure reveals that V557L shifts the position of the

76

template base, which in turn shifts the positioning of the incoming NTP (Fig. S1 A, B). This will impact

77

RDV activity in that it alters the position of the 1’CN in the pocket. Because the model predicts no direct

78

interaction of F480 with the NTP, primer, or template, the effect of the F480L mutation is more difficult

79

to discern. The F480L mutation could potentially induce a subtle change to the 1’CN binding pocket (Fig.

80

S1 C, D). Alignment of nsp12 sequences from SARS-CoV-2 used in other studies of RDV shows

81

complete conservation of nsp12 nucleotide sequences, predicting the comparable antiviral activity of

82

RDV against these isolates (Fig. S2). We next modeled the active sites of the six other human CoVs

83

SARS-CoV-1 (Fig. S3A), MERS-CoV (Fig. S3B), HCoV-OC43 (Fig. S3C), -229E (Fig. S3D), -NL63

84

(Fig. S3E), and -HKU1 (Fig. S3F). The models show that SARS-CoV-2 is identical to SARS-CoV-1 out

85

to a radius of 18 Å from the active site. Differences detected on the periphery of the active site of the

86

MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43, -229E, -NL63, and HKU1 correspond to residues that do not directly

87

interact RDV-TP. Together, these data demonstrate high structural conservation of the RdRp active site

88

interacting with RDV-TP across all seven known human CoV strains.

89

Remdesivir and GS-441524 potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Remdesivir (RDV) and its

90

parent nucleoside analog GS-441524 inhibit CoVs and multiple other viruses (Agostini et al., 2018; Cho

91

et al., 2012; Lo et al., 2017; Sheahan et al., 2017; Warren et al., 2016). Previous reports (Choy et al.,

92

2020; Wang et al., 2020; Runfeng et al., 2020) suggest RDV inhibits SARS-CoV-2, but comparative

93

studies of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity using authentic compound in physiologically relevant cell lines are

94

lacking. We first compared SARS-CoV-2 replication in established cell lines to determine which cell

95

types could potentially be suitable for studying RDV efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Viral yields were

96

determined at 24, 48, and 72 hours post-infection (hpi) in Vero E6, Vero CCL-81 (Vero), Huh7, and

97

Calu3 2B4 (Yoshikawa et al., 2010) cells (Fig. 2A). Vero E6 and Vero cells supported highest levels of

98

SARS-CoV-2 replication, consistent with a previous study (Harcourt et al.). Maximum yields were

99

detected at 48 hpi in Vero E6 cells (>6 logs at MOI = 0.1 and 0.01 PFU/cell), 24 hpi in Vero cells infected

100

at MOI = 0.1 PFU (>5 logs), 48 hpi in Vero cells infected at MOI = 0.01 PFU/cell (>5 logs), 72 hpi in

101

Calu3 2B4 (>4 logs at MOI = 0.1 PFU/cell), and 48 hpi in Huh7 cells (>4 logs at MOI = 0.1 PFU/cell, <2

102

logs at MOI = 0.01 PFU/cell). These results indicate that Vero E6, Vero, and Calu3 2B4 cells support

103

varying levels of SARS-CoV-2 replication and cell type should be chosen for a given study depending on

104

study goals.

105

To determine if RDV and GS-441524 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in established cell lines, Calu3

106

2B4 human lung adenocarcinoma cells and Vero E6 African green monkey kidney cells were infected

107

with the SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 and treated with a range of RDV or

108

GS-441524 concentrations. Supernatants were harvested at time points corresponding to peak viral

109

replication for each cell type, and infectious viral titer and viral genome copy number in the supernatant

110

were quantified by plaque assay and RT-qPCR, respectively. RDV and GS-441524 potently inhibited

111

SARS-CoV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner in both cell types (Fig. 2; Table 1). In Calu3 cells,

112

both compounds displayed dose-dependent inhibition of viral replication as determined by plaque assay

113

(Fig. 2B) and RT-qPCR (Fig. 2C). RDV inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 = 0.28 μM and EC90 = 2.48

114

μM. The parent compound GS-441524 was less potent: EC50 = 0.62 μM, EC90 = 1.34 μM (Fig. 2D; Table

115

1). EC50 values determined by quantification of viral genome copies were roughly two-fold higher than

116

those obtained by quantification of infectious virus (Fig. 2E; Table 1). Both compounds also displayed

117

dose-dependent inhibition of viral replication in Vero E6 cells as determined by infectious viral titer and

118

genome copy number (Fig 2F). RDV inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 = 1.65 μM and EC90 = 2.40 μM,

119

while GS-441524 was more potent (EC50 = 0.47 μM, EC90 = 0.71 μM) (Fig. 2G; Table 1). Relative

120

potency based on genome copies was similar to that assessed by quantification of infectious viral titer in

121

Vero E6 cells (Fig. 2H; Table 1). Thus, RDV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 more potently in Calu3 2B4 than in

122

Vero E6 cells.

123

RDV is a highly potent antiviral inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 in primary human airway epithelial

124

(HAE) cultures. Primary HAE cultures grown on air-liquid interface recapitulate the cellular complexity

125

and physiology of the human conducting airway (Sims et al., 2005). Therefore, we evaluated antiviral

126

activity of RDV in this biologically relevant model. In RDV treated HAE, we observed a dose-dependent

127

reduction in infectious virus production, with >100-fold inhibition at the highest tested concentration

128

(Fig. 3A). Importantly, RDV demonstrate potent antiviral activity with EC50 values of 0.0010 and 0.009

129

µM in two independent experiments (Fig. 3B). We previously reported that RDV is not cytotoxic at doses

130

at or below 10 µM in this culture system, supporting the conclusion that the observed antiviral effect was

131

virus-specific (Sheahan et al., 2017). Together, these data demonstrate that RDV is potently antiviral

132

against SARS-CoV-2 in primary human lung cultures with a selectivity index of >1000.

133

Antiviral activities of RDV and GS-441524 correlate with RDV-TP metabolite levels. Cell type

134

specific expression of genes that metabolize ribonucleoside analogs can have a profound impact on

135

activity (Eriksson, 2013; Koczor et al., 2012). Table 1 and prior studies (Bojkova et al., 2020; Choy et al.,

136

2020; Jeon et al., 2020) demonstrate the antiviral activity of RDV against SARS-CoV-2 is highly variable

137

in different cell culture models. Both RDV and GS-441524 undergo intracellular conversion to the active

138

metabolite RDV-TP involving several metabolic steps (Fig. S4) and the efficiency of each step might

139

differ between cell types. Therefore, to reconcile the differences in antiviral activity of RDV and GS-

140

441524 observed in our and other studies, we compared intracellular RDV-TP concentrations in Vero E6,

141

Calu3 2B4, and HAEs following incubation with the two compounds. RDV-TP levels per million cells

142

produced after 8- to 48-hour treatment with RDV were substantially higher in primary HAE cultures than

143

either Calu3 2B4 or Vero E6. (Fig 4; Table 1; Tables S1, S2). Given the primary nature of HAE cultures,

144

we used cells from two independent donors with similar demographic profiles. RDV-TP was efficiently

145

formed in both donor cultures following incubation with RDV with a difference of < 3-fold from each

146

other. The lowest levels of RDV-TP were observed following RDV treatment of Vero E6 cells and were

147

approximately 4- and 20-fold lower than those observed in Calu3 2B4 and HAE cultures, respectively.

148

The levels of GS-441524 as well as the intermediate mono- and di-phosphorylated metabolites (RDV-MP

149

and RDV-DP) were readily detected in Calu3 2B4 cultures following treatment with RDV, but were

150

below the limit of quantification in Vero E6 cells at all time points tested (Table S1). In addition,

151

incubation of Vero E6 cells with GS-441524 yielded 4-fold higher RDV-TP levels compared to

152

incubation with RDV corresponding to higher antiviral potency of GS-441524 relative to RDV, which is

153

not observed with either Calu3 or HAE cultures. (Table S1, S2). In conclusion, the RDV-TP levels in the

154

different cell types directly correlated with the antiviral potencies of RDV and GS-441524 against SARS-

155

CoV-2 with the HAE cultures producing substantially higher levels of RDV-TP that translated into

156

markedly more potent antiviral activity of RDV (Table 1). Importantly, the metabolism of RDV in Vero

157

E6 cells appeared altered and was less efficient particularly in comparison with the HAE cultures,

158

indicating that Vero E6 cells might not be an adequate cell type to characterize the antiviral activity of

159

RDV and potentially also other nucleotide prodrug-based antivirals.

160

RDV is active against the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in vivo. To determine whether RDV exerts antiviral

161

effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vivo, we constructed a chimeric mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-1 variant encoding

162

the target of RDV antiviral activity, the RdRp, of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS1/SARS2-RdRp) (Fig. 5A).

163

Although other chimeric replicase ORF recombinant CoVs have shown to be viable (Stobart et al., 2013),

164

this is the first demonstration that the RdRp from a related but different CoV can support efficient

165

replication of another. After recovery and sequence-confirmation (Fig. 5B) of recombinant chimeric

166

viruses with and without nanoluciferase reporter, we compared SARS-CoV-1 and SARS1/SARS2-RdRp

167

replication and sensitivity to RDV in Huh7 cells. Replication of both viruses was inhibited similarly in a

168

dose-dependent manner by RDV (SARS-CoV-1 mean EC50 = 0.007 µM; SARS1/SARS2-RdRp mean

169

EC50 = 0.003 µM) (Fig. 5C and D). We then sought to determine the therapeutic efficacy of RDV against

170

the SARS1/SARS2-RdRp in mouse models employed for previous studies of RDV (Sheahan et al., 2017).

171

Mice produce a serum esterase absent in humans, carboxyl esterase 1c (Ces1c), that dramatically reduces

172

half-life of RDV. Thus, to mirror pharmacokinetics observed in humans, mouse studies with RDV must

173

be performed in transgenic C57Bl/6 Ces1c-/- mice (Sheahan et al., 2017). We infected female C57Bl/6

174

Ces1c-/- mice with 103 PFU SARS1/SARS2-RdRp and initiated subcutaneous treatment with 25 mg/kg

175

RDV BID at one day post-infection (dpi). This regimen was continued until study termination. While

176

weight loss did not differ between vehicle- and RDV-treated animals (Fig. 5E), lung hemorrhage at five

177

dpi was significantly reduced with RDV treatment (Fig. 5F). To gain insight into physiologic metrics of

178

disease severity, we measured pulmonary function daily by whole body plethysmography (WBP). The

179

WBP metric, PenH, is a surrogate marker of pulmonary obstruction (Menachery et al., 2015a).

180

Therapeutic RDV significantly ameliorated loss of pulmonary function observed in the vehicle-treated

181

group (Fig. 5G). Importantly, RDV treatment dramatically reduced lung viral load (Fig. 5H). Taken

182

together, these data demonstrate that therapeutically administered RDV can reduce virus replication and

183

improve pulmonary function in an ongoing infection with a chimeric SARS-CoV-1/SARS-CoV-2 virus

184

encoding the target of RDV, the RdRp.

185
186

DISCUSSION

187

The COVID-19 pandemic has gravely illustrated the need for countermeasures against emerging epidemic

188

and pandemic CoVs. Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, antibodies, and vaccines are needed to combat the

189

current pandemic and those that will emerge in the future. RDV shows potent activity against an array of

190

genetically diverse CoVs as well as against unrelated emerging viruses like Ebola (Agostini et al., 2018;

191

Brown et al., 2019; Sheahan et al., 2017, 2020a; Warren et al., 2016). In this study, we demonstrate that

192

RDV and its parent nucleoside GS-441524 are active against SARS-CoV-2 in a physiologically relevant

193

cell line and that RDV exerts substantially higher antiviral activity in primary human airway cultures.

194

Potency was directly related to the intracellular concentration of pharmacologically active triphosphate

195

metabolite, which was markedly higher in primary HAE cultures compared to human lung cells (Calu3

196

2B4) and monkey kidney cells (Vero E6). Our data are consistent with recent studies demonstrating

197

important contributions of natural variation in host and tissue specific gene expression patterns and

198

microbiome specific contributions to drug metabolism, stability, and bioavailability in different tissues

199

(Eriksson, 2013; Koczor et al., 2012). Modeling of RDV onto the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp revealed that the

200

positioning of the RDV into the active site closely resembled that of cognate natural substrate ATP,

201

consistent with efficient incorporation into RNA during replication of the viral genome. RDV decreased

202

viral loads and improved lung function in mice infected with SARS1/SARS2-RdRp chimeric virus when

203

treated at 1 dpi. This is the first rigorous demonstration of potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in

204

continuous and primary human lung cultures and first study suggesting efficacy of RDV against SARS-

205

CoV-2 in mice.

206

Previous studies of RDV anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity reported EC50 values of 0.77 μM as determined by

207

quantification of genome copy number (Wang et al., 2020), 23.15 μM as determined by TCID50, 26.90 as

208

determined by RNA copy number (Choy et al., 2020), and 0.651 μM as determined by cytopathic effect

209

(CPE) (Runfeng et al., 2020), all in Vero E6 cells. The potency of RDV in Vero E6 cells (EC50 1.65 μM)

210

observed in our study is comparable to values reported by Wang et al. and Runfeng et al., but greater than

211

reported by Choy et al. Sequence comparison of the nsp12 from the Seattle, WA isolate used in this study

212

versus SARS-CoV-2 isolates used in the previously mentioned studies assessing RDV potency did not

213

reveal consensus changes in nsp12 sequence, suggesting that any isolate-specific variation in RDV

214

sensitivity is not likely due to differences in the RDV-TP interaction with the RdRp. Therefore, the

215

differences in EC50 may be partially explained by intrinsic differences of SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates,

216

quantification methods, and assay conditions such as incubation period and virus input.

217

Although Vero E6 cells support robust replication of SARS-CoV-2 as illustrated here and elsewhere, our

218

study emphasized the extreme caution that should be exercised when interpreting drug efficacy and

219

potency experiments performed using Vero cell lineages. Nucleoside analog efficacy is greatly dependent

220

on metabolism into the active form. In contrast to GS-441524, RDV contains a protective group which

221

facilitates cellular uptake of the nucleoside analog and addition of the first phosphate group, which

222

accelerates conversion to the active triphosphate (Mehellou et al., 2018). Consistent with previous reports

223

(Agostini et al., 2018), RDV showed enhanced inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 over GS-441524 in Calu3 2B4

224

cells. In contrast, RDV was two-fold less potent than GS-441524 in Vero E6 cells. Relative potency of

225

the two compounds was directly linked to intracellular concentration of the active triphosphate

226

metabolite, suggesting an altered uptake and/or intracellular metabolism of RDV, consistent with a

227

previous report describing inefficient metabolism of the nucleotide prodrug sofosbuvir in Vero cells

228

(Mumtaz et al., 2017). Drug potency in Vero E6 was similar whether quantified by infectious virus or

229

genome copy number. In Calu3 cells, the potency determined by RT-qPCR was about two-fold lower

230

than when quantified by plaque assay. It is possible that RT-qPCR, which was developed to detect

231

nucleocapsid (N) RNA, also detects packaged subgenomic RNAs and defective genomes in addition to

232

full-length genomes. This would result in underestimation of the reduction in infectious titer. Notably, the

233

potency of RDV against SARS-CoV-1 encoding the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in Huh7 cells was more than

234

100-fold higher than that of RDV against bona-fide SARS-CoV-2 in Huh7 and Calu3 cells. This

235

difference could be due to infectivity, which is driven by the SARS-CoV-1 instead of the SARS-CoV-2

236

spike protein. In addition, SARS-CoV-1 infects Huh7 cells at low frequency at the MOI used in this study

237

and does not appear to spread throughout the culture over the course of the experiment. The number of

238

Huh7 cells in which virus replicates is relatively lower compared to Calu3 cells, possibly enhancing

239

potency of RDV in Huh7 compared to Calu3. Interestingly, the antiviral potency of RDV against SARS8

240

CoV-2 in HAE cultures was comparable to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV (Sheahan et al., 2017), which

241

is consistent with the high conservation of the RdRp active site across these different CoVs. Together,

242

these results emphasize the need for careful selection and use of multiple cell types and methods to study

243

potency and efficacy of nucleoside analogs and other antiviral compounds.

244

The target of RDV antiviral activity is the viral RdRp. To mirror the pharmacokinetic exposures observed

245

in humans, RDV studies in mice must be performed in Ces1c-/- animals (Sheahan et al., 2017). In

246

addition, SARS-CoV-2 does not readily infect WT mice due to incompatibilities between virus spike and

247

the murine ortholog of ACE2, which serves as the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor (Wan et al., 2020). The

248

breeding a doubly transgenic (hACE2, Ces1c-/-) mice for use in RDV efficacy studies is ongoing. To

249

rapidly assess the therapeutic efficacy of RDV against SARS-CoV-2, we constructed recombinant SARS-

250

CoV-1 chimeric virus encoding the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (SARS1/SARS2-RdRp). Virus entry, tropism,

251

and pathogenesis of this chimeric virus are driven by parental mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-1 virus. Similar

252

to our previous studies with SARS-CoV-1 (Sheahan et al., 2017), we now show that therapeutic

253

administration of RDV one dpi can both reduce viral load and improve pulmonary function in mice. The

254

kinetics of SARS-CoV-1 replication and disease are notably compressed in mice as compared to humans

255

where virus titer peaks 10-15 days after onset of symptoms (Hung et al., 2004; Peiris et al., 2004). By

256

comparison, initial reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 replication peaks around 5-6 days after symptom

257

onset, just prior to onset of dyspnea (Pan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a). A recent preprint described the

258

therapeutic efficacy of RDV against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques, where RDV treatment reduced

259

respiratory pathology and viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (Williamson et al., 2020). Prior to

260

the emergence of pandemic SARS-CoV-2, RDV was evaluated in phase 1 clinical trials as well as phase 2

261

randomized controlled trial trials to treat acute Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo

262

(DRC), and human safety data are available (Mulangu et al., 2019). Thus, our preclinical development of

263

RDV positioned RDV for immediate compassionate use of RDV for severely ill COVID-19 patients.

264

While early results are promising (Grein et al., 2020), Phase III randomized controlled trials for the

265

treatment of patients with COVID-19 are ongoing globally and will ultimately determine efficacy, safety,

266

and optimal dosing of RDV in patients with different stages of COVID-19.

267

Despite worldwide drug discovery efforts and over 300 active clinical evaluations of potential treatments,

268

no effective countermeasure currently exists to combat COVID-19 (Sanders et al., 2020) or likely future

269

CoV pandemics. Large-scale deployment of antiviral monotherapies creates high risk for emergence of

270

drug resistance. Our previous work demonstrates that CoV resistance to RDV is generated slowly and is

271

conferred by two mutations in the RdRp. In addition, RDV-resistant CoVs exhibit reduced replication

272

capacity and are also more sensitive to another potently active nucleoside analog inhibitor β-D-N49

hydroxycytidine (NHC; EIDD-1931/2801) (Agostini et al., 2019; Sheahan et al., 2020b). Therapies

274

combining direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) such as RDV and NHC, along with other DAAs such as

275

antibodies and protease inhibitors that target different stages of the viral replication cycle, could be

276

considered for counteracting resistance if it emerges in patients treated with antiviral monotherapy. In

277

addition, attention should be given to combining DAAs with anti-inflammatory drugs to potentially

278

extend the treatment window during which DAAs can improve outcomes. With SARS-CoV-1-, SARS-

279

CoV-2-, and MERS-like CoVs continuing to circulate in bat species, more outbreaks of novel CoVs are

280

expected (Menachery et al., 2015b, 2016). Identification and evaluation of broadly efficacious, robust

281

anti-CoV therapies are thus urgently needed in the present and future.

METHODS

389

Cells, viruses, and compounds. Vero (ATCC CCL-81) and Vero E6 (ATCC CRL-1586) cells were

390

purchased from ATCC and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco,

391

ThermoFisher Scientific) or 10% FCS fetal clonal serum (FCS)(HyClone, GE Life Sciences), 100 U/ml

392

penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco, ThermoFisher Scientific), and 0.25 μM amphotericin B (Corning).

393

Human hepatoma (Huh7) cells were provided by Dr. Mark Heise at UNC Chapel Hill and grown in

394

DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone) and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, ThermoFisher

395

Scientific). Calu3 2B4 cells (Yoshikawa et al., 2010) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 20%

396

FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin, and 0.25 μM amphotericin B.

397

Primary HAE cell cultures used in antiviral activity assays were obtained from the Tissue Procurement

398

and Cell Culture Core Laboratory in the Marsico Lung Institute/Cystic Fibrosis Research Center at UNC.

399

All assays in this report were performed using a single HAE cell donor. Human tracheobronchial

400

epithelial cells provided by Dr. Scott Randell were obtained from airway specimens resected from

401

patients undergoing surgery under University of North Carolina Institutional Review Board-approved

402

protocols (#03-1396) by the Cystic Fibrosis Center Tissue Culture Core. Primary cells were expanded to

403

generate passage 1 cells and passage 2 cells were plated at a density of 250,000 cells per well on

404

Transwell-COL (12mm diameter) supports (Corning). Human airway epithelium cultures (HAE) were

405

generated by provision of an air-liquid interface for 6 to 8 weeks to form well-differentiated, polarized

406

cultures that resembled in vivo pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium (Fulcher et al., 2005).

407

Clinical specimens of SARS-CoV-2 from a case-patient who acquired COVID-19 during travel to China

408

and diagnosed in Washington State, USA upon return were collected as described (Holshue et al., 2020).

409

Virus isolation from this patient’s specimens was performed as described in (Harcourt et al.). The

410

sequence is available through GenBank (accession number MN985325). A passage 3 stock of the SARS-

411

CoV-2 Seattle isolate was obtained from the CDC and passed twice in Vero E6 cells to generate high-titer

412

passage 5 stock for experiments described in this manuscript.

413

SARS-CoV-1 expressing GFP (GFP replaces ORF7) was created from molecular cDNA clones as

414

described (Scobey et al., 2013; Sims et al., 2005). To create SARS-CoV-1 expressing nanoluciferase

415

(nLUC), the gene for GFP was replaced with nLUC and isolated using our existing mouse adapted SARS-

416

CoV-1 (MA15) SARS-CoV-1 Urbani molecular clone (Yount et al., 2003). A synthetic cDNA encoding

417

the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (Integrated DNA Technologies) was cloned into SARS MA15 D fragment using

418

StuI (5’) and BsaI (3’) via Gibson assembly. The resultant plasmids were sequence confirmed and then

419

utilized to generate recombinant virus with or without nanoluciferase as described. Recombinant virus

420

stocks were confirmed to harbor SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by Sanger sequencing.

421

Remdesivir (RDV; GS-5734) and GS-441524 were synthesized by the Department of Medicinal

422

Chemistry, Gilead Sciences (Foster City, CA).

423

Modeling. A model of the elongating SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex was generated based on a

424

homology model which used the cryo-EM structure of apo SARS-CoV-1 as a template (PDB: 6NUR,

425

(Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019) as described previously (Gordon et al., 2020b). RNA primer and template,

426

a substrate ATP and two catalytic Mg++ ions were oriented in the structure based on alignment to a ternary

427

x-ray structure of HCV NS5B (PDB: 4WTD, (Appleby et al., 2015). The structure was then optimized

428

with a series of constrained minimizations. To this structure we aligned the new cryo-EM structure of the

429

SARS-CoV-2 replication complex. As the SARS-CoV-2 structure does not significantly differ from the

430

SARS-CoV-1 structure, rather than a complete replacement of the model, we incorporated only those

431

residues that had not been resolved in the previous structure (residues 31-116). Additional optimization,

432

particularly of the RNA in the exit channel, was done following the previously outlined procedures. After

433

optimization of the ATP structure, RDV-TP was modeled into the active site and minimized. Models of

434

the V557L and F480L mutants and the other coronavirus models reported here were generated based on

435

this final model. All work was carried out using Prime and Macromodel (Schrödinger, LLC, New York,

436

NY, 2020). 3D coordinates of the SARS-CoV-2/RDV-TP model are provided in the Supplementary

437

Material.

438

Sequence alignments. Coronavirus nsp12 sequence alignment was generated using CLC Workbench

439

(Qiagen) from sequences downloaded from the NCBI website (Accession numbers MN985325.1 and

440

MT123290.1) and from GISAID’s EpiFlu™ Database (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017; Shu and

451

minutes (min) at 37°C with manual rocking every 10 min. Virus inoculum was removed, cells were

452

washed in PBS, and 0.5 ml medium was added to each well. Supernatant was collected at 0, 24, 48, and

453

72 h post-infection, and infectious viral titer in supernatants was determined by plaque assay.

454

Antiviral activity assays. Vero E6 cells were seeded at 1 x 105 cells per well, and Calu3 2B4 cells were

455

seeded at 2 x 105 cells per well in 24-well plates (Corning). Cells were allowed to adhere for 16-24 h.

456

Drugs were dissolved in DSMO and serially diluted in DMSO to achieve 1000x final concentration.

457

Equal volumes of each 1000x concentration were further diluted 1000-fold in medium up to 2 h before

458

start of the infection. Cells were adsorbed at MOI = 0.01 PFU/cell with SARS-CoV-2 in gel saline for 30

459

min at 37°C. Plates were rocked manually to redistribute the inoculum every 10 minutes. Viral inoculum

460

was removed, and cells were washed with pre-warmed PBS+/+ (Corning) for 5 minutes. PBS+/+ was

461

removed, and medium containing dilutions of RDV, GS-441524, or vehicle (DMSO) was added. Cells

462

were incubated at 37°C. At 48 (Vero E6) or 72 (Calu3 2B4) hpi, supernatants were harvested and

463

processed for plaque assay and RT-qPCR.

464

Huh7 cells were plated at a density of 8 x 104 cells per well. Twenty-four hours later, fresh medium was

465

added. Triplicate wells of cells were infected for 1 h at 37°C with SARS1/SARS2-RdRp-nLUC or SARS-

466

CoV-1-nLUC diluted 1:100 in culture medium. Virus was removed, cultures were rinsed once with

467

medium, and fresh medium containing dilutions of RDV or vehicle (DMSO) was added. DMSO (0.05%)

468

was constant in all conditions. At 48 hpi, virus replication was measured by nLUC assay (Promega) using

469

a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices).

470

Before infection, HAE cultures (approximately 1 x 106 cells per well) were washed with phosphate-

471

buffered saline (PBS) and moved into air-liquid interface medium containing various doses of RDV

472

ranging from 0.00260 to10 mM (final DMSO, <0.05%). Cultures were infected with SARS-CoV-2

473

clinical isolate (2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020) at MOI = 0.5 PFU/cell for 2 h at 37°C, after which virus

474

was removed and cultures were washed three times with PBS, followed by incubation at 37°C for 48 h.

475

The apical surface of each culture was washed with PBS and collected for virus titration, measured as

476

plaque-forming units (PFU) as previously described for SARS-CoV-1 (Scobey et al., 2013; Sims et al.,

477

2005).

478

Cytotoxicity Assays. Cells were seeded at a density of 15,000 cells/well (Vero E6) or 30,000 cells/well

479

(Calu3 2B4) in a white-wall clear-bottom 96-well plate (Corning) and incubated at 37°C overnight.

480

Medium was removed, and serial dilutions of drug in medium were added to each well (see “antiviral

481

activity assays”). Cytotoxicity was determined using CellTiterGlo Cell Viability Assay (Promega)

482

according to manufacturer’s instructions at 48 h (Vero E6) or 72 h (Calu3). HAE cultures were treated

21

483

with the same concentration range of drug in Transwell plates (Corning). Cytotoxicity in HAE was

484

previously determined by RT-qPCR of TRIzol-extracted RNA (Sheahan et al., 2017)

485

Quantification of infectious viral titer by plaque assay. Approximately 1 x 106 Vero E6 cells/well were

486

seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates (Corning) and allowed to grow to confluence for 48 h. Medium was

487

removed, and 200 µL of 10-fold serial dilutions of virus-containing supernatants in gel saline were

488

adsorbed in duplicate for 30 min at 37°C. Plates were rocked manually to redistribute inoculum every 10

489

minutes. Cells were overlaid with a 1:1 mixture of 2x DMEM and 2% agar in ddH2O and incubated at

490

37°C. Plaques were enumerated in unstained monolayers at 48-72 hpi using a light box.

491

Quantification of viral RNA genome copy number by RT-qPCR. Cell supernatants were harvested in

492

TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen), and RNA was purified following phase separation by chloroform as

493

recommended by the manufacturer. RNA in the aqueous phase was collected and further purified using

494

PureLink RNA Mini Kits (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Viral RNA was quantified

495

by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System

496

(Applied Biosystems) using TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix chemistry (Applied Biosystems).

497

SARS-CoV-2 N gene RNA was amplified using forward (5’-GACCCCAAAATCAGCGAAAT) and

498

reverse (5’-TCTGGTTACTGCCAGTTGAATCTG) primers and probe (5’- FAM-

499

ACCCCGCATTACGTTTGGTGGACC-BHQ1) designed by the United States Centers for Disease

500

Control and Prevention (oligonucleotides produced by IDT, cat# 10006606). RNA copy numbers were

501

interpolated from a standard curve produced with serial 10-fold dilutions of N gene RNA. Briefly, SARS-

502

CoV-2 N gene positive control plasmid (IDT, cat# 10006625) served as template to PCR-amplify a 1280

503

bp product using forward (5’-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGATGTCTGATAATGGACCCCA) and

504

reverse (5’- TTAGGCCTGAGTTGAGTCAG) primers that appended a T7 RNA polymerase promoter to

505

the 5’ end of the complete N ORF. PCR product was column purified (Promega) for subsequent in vitro

506

transcription of N RNA using mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Transcription Kit (Invitrogen) according to

507

manufacturer’s protocol. N RNA was purified using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to

508

manufacturer’s protocol, and copy number was calculated using SciencePrimer.com cop number

509

calculator.

510

In vitro metabolism of RDV and GS-441524. Calu3 2B4 or Vero E6 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate

511

at 8.0 x 105 or 3.5 X 105 cells/well, respectively. Twenty-four hours later, cell culture media was replaced

512

with media containing 1 μM RDV (GS-5734) or GS-441524 and incubated at 37˚C. Differentiated HAE

513

cultures from two healthy donors (MatTek Corporation; Ashland, MA) were maintained with media

514

replacement every other day for 1 week. The HAE donors were 56- and 62-year-old females of the same

515

race. At the time of treatment, media was replaced on the basal side of the transwell HAE culture, while
22

516

the apical surface media was replaced with 200 µL media containing 1 μM RDV. At 8, 24 and 48h post

517

drug addition to all cultures, cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold tris-buffered saline, scraped into 0.5

518

mL ice-cold 70% methanol and stored at -80°C. Extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 15 minutes

519

and supernatants were transferred to clean tubes for evaporation in a MiVac Duo concentrator (Genevac).

520

Dried samples were reconstituted in mobile phase A containing 3 mM ammonium formate (pH 5) with 10

521

mM dimethylhexylamine (DMH) in water for analysis by LC-MS/MS, using a multi-stage linear gradient

522

from 10% to 50% acetonitrile in mobile phase A at a flow rate of 300 μL/min. Analytes were separated

523

using a 50 x 2 mm, 2.5 μm Luna C18(2) HST column (Phenomenex) connected to an LC-20ADXR

524

(Shimadzu) ternary pump system and HTS PAL autosampler (LEAP Technologies). Detection was

525

performed on a Qtrap 6500+ (AB Sciex) mass spectrometer operating in positive ion and multiple

526

reaction monitoring modes. Analytes were quantified using a 7-point standard curve ranging in

527

concentration from 0.156 to 40 pmol prepared in extracts from untreated cells. For normalization by cell

528

number, multiple untreated Calu3 or Vero E6 culture wells were counted at each timepoint. HAE cells

529

were counted at the 24-h timepoint and the counts for other timepoints were determined by normalized to

530

endogenous ATP levels for accuracy.

531

Formulations for in vivo studies. RDV was solubilized at 2.5 mg/mL in vehicle containing 12%

532

sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin sodium salt in water (with HCl/NaOH) at pH 5.0.

533

In vivo efficacy studies. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the University of

534

North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee policies and guidelines. To

535

achieve a pharmacokinetic profile similar to that observed in humans, we performed therapeutic efficacy

536

studies in Ces1c-/- mice (stock 014096, The Jackson Laboratory), which lack a serum esterase not present

537

in humans that dramatically reduces RDV half-life (Sheahan et al., 2017). 17 week-old female Ces1c-/-

538

mice were anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine and intranasally infected with 103 PFU

539

SARS1/SARS2-RdRp in 50 µL. One dpi, vehicle (n = 7) and RDV (n = 7) dosing was initiated (25 mg/kg

540

subcutaneously) and continued every 12 h until the end of the study at five dpi. To monitor morbidity,

541

mice were weighed daily. Pulmonary function testing was performed daily by whole body

542

plethysmography (WBP) (Data Sciences International) (Sheahan et al., 2017). At five dpi, animals were

543

sacrificed by isoflurane overdose, lungs were scored for lung hemorrhage, and the inferior right lobe was

544

frozen at −80°C for viral titration via plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. Lung hemorrhage is a gross

545

pathological phenotype readily observed by the naked eye and driven by the degree of virus replication,

546

where lung coloration changes from pink to dark red (Sheahan et al., 2017, 2020a). For the plaque assay,

547

5 x 105 Vero E6 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates. The following day, medium was removed, and

548

monolayers were adsorbed at 37˚C for one h with serial dilutions of sample ranging from 10-1 to 10-6.

549

Cells were overlayed with 1X DMEM, 5% Fetal Clone 2 serum, 1× antibiotic-antimycotic, 0.8% agarose.

550

Viral plaques were enumerated three days later.

551

Mathematical and statistical analyses. The EC50 value was defined in GraphPad Prism 8 as the

552

concentration at which there was a 50% decrease in viral replication relative to vehicle alone (0%

553

inhibition). Curves were fitted based on four parameter non-linear regression analysis. All statistical tests

554

were executed using GraphPad Prism 8.
