Abstract:

33

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in an

34

unprecedented public health crisis. There are no approved vaccines or therapeutics for

35

treating COVID-19. Here we reported a humanized monoclonal antibody, H014,

36

efficiently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses as well as

37

authentic SARS-CoV-2 at nM level by engaging the S receptor binding domain

38

(RBD). Importantly, H014 administration reduced SARS-CoV-2 titers in the infected

39

lungs and prevented pulmonary pathology in hACE2 mouse model. Cryo-EM

40

characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer in complex with the H014 Fab fragment

41

unveiled a novel conformational epitope, which is only accessible when the RBD is in

42

open conformation. Biochemical, cellular, virological and structural studies

43

demonstrated that H014 prevents attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to its host cell receptors.

44

Epitope analysis of available neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV and

45

SARS-CoV-2 uncover broad cross-protective epitopes. Our results highlight a key

46

role for antibody-based therapeutic interventions in the treatment of COVID-19.

Main Text: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had afflicted >7

64

million people in more than 200 countries/regions, resulting in 400,000 deaths as of 8

65

June, according to the World Health Organization. The etiological agent of this

66

pandemic is the newly emerging coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome

67

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which, together with the closely related SARS-CoV

68

belongs to the lineage B of the genus Betacoronavirus in the Coronaviridae family (1).

69

Sharing an amino acid sequence identity of ~80% in the envelope-located spike (S)

70

glycoprotein, both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV utilize human angiotensin

71

converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) to enter into host cells. Cellular entry is achieved by

72

the homotrimeric S mediated virus-receptor engagement through the receptor binding

73

domain (RBD) followed by virus-host membrane fusion (1, 2). Abrogation of this

74

crucial role played by the S-protein in the establishment of an infection is the main

75

goal of neutralizing antibodies and the focus of therapeutic interventions as well as

76

vaccine design (3-6). Several previously characterized SARS-CoV neutralizing

77

antibodies (NAbs) were demonstrated to exhibit very limited neutralization activities

78

against SARS-CoV-2 (7-9). Among these, CR3022, a weakly neutralizing antibody

79

against SARS-CoV, is tight binding, but non-neutralizing for SARS-CoV-2,

80

indicative of possible conformational differences in the neutralizing epitopes (9).

81

More recent studies have reported two SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies, 47D11

82

and S309, that have been shown to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 as well (10, 11),

83

suggesting that broad cross-neutralizing epitopes exist within lineage B. Convalescent

84

plasma containing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) have been shown to

85

confer clear protection in COVID-19 patients (12, 13), yet gaps in our knowledge

86

concerning the immunogenic features and key epitopes of SARS-CoV-2, have

87

hampered the development of effective immuno-therapeutics against the virus.

88
89

The RBDs of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have an amino-acid sequence identity of

90

around 75%, raising the possibility that RBD-targeting cross-neutralizing NAbs could

91

be possibly identified. Using phage display technique, we constructed an antibody

92

library which was generated from RNAs extracted from peripheral lymphocytes of

93

mice immunized with recombinant SARS-CoV RBD. SARS-CoV-2 RBD was used as

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.02.129098; this version posted June 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

94

the target for screening the phage antibody library for potential hits. Antibodies

95

showing tight binding for SARS-CoV-2 RBD were further propagated as chimeric

96

antibodies and tested for neutralizing activities using a vesicular stomatitis virus

97

(VSV) based pseudotyping system (fig. S1) (14). Among the antibodies tested, clone

98

014 which showed potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was

99

humanized, named as H014. To evaluate the binding affinities, real-time association

100

and dissociation of H014 binding to either SARS-CoV-2 RBD or SARS-CoV RBD

101

were monitored using the OCTET system (Fortebio). Both H014 Ig G and Fab

102

fragments exhibited tight binding to both RBDs with comparable binding affinities at

103

sub-nM levels for SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD, respectively (Fig. 1A

104

and fig. S2). Pseudovirus neutralization assays revealed that H014 has potent

105

neutralizing activities: a 50% neutralizing concentration value (IC50) of 3 nM and 1

106

nM against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses, respectively (Fig. 1B).

107

Plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) conducted against an authentic

108

SARS-CoV-2 strain (BetaCoV/Beijing/AMMS01/2020) verified the neutralizing

109

activities with an IC50 of 38 nM, 10-fold lower than those observed in the

110

pseudotyping system (Fig. 1C). We next sought to assess in vivo protection efficacy of

111

H014 in our previously established human ACE2 (hACE2) humanized mouse model

112

that was sensitized to SARS-CoV-2 infection (15). In this model, as a result of hACE2

113

expression on lung cells, SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into the lungs and replicates as in a

114

human disease, exhibiting lung pathology at 5 days post infection (dpi).

115

hACE2-humanized mice were treated by intraperitoneal injection of H014 at 50

116

mg/kg either 4 hours after (1 dose, therapeutic) or 12 hours before and 4 hours after (2

117

doses, prophylactic plus therapeutic) intranasal infection with 5 × 105 PFU of

118

SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/Beijing /AMMS01/2020). All challenged animals were

119

sacrificed at day 5. While the viral loads in the lungs of the PBS group (control)

120

surged to ~107 RNA copies/g at day 5 (Fig. 1D), remarkably, in the prophylactic and

121

prophylactic plus therapeutic groups, H014 treatment resulted in a ~10-fold and

122

100-fold reduction of viral titers in the lungs at day 5, respectively (Fig. 1D). Lung

123

pathology analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 caused mild interstitial pneumonia

124

characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, alveolar septal thickening and

125

distinctive vascular system injury upon PBS treatment. In contrast, no obvious lesions

126

of alveolar epithelial cells or focal hemorrhage were observed in the lung sections

127

from mice that received H014 treatment (Fig. 1E), indicative of a potential therapeutic

128

role for H014 in curing COVID-19.

129
130

The overall structure of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer resembles those of SARS-CoV and

131

other coronaviruses. Each monomer of the S protein is composed of two functional

132

subunits. The S1 subunit binds the host cell receptor, while the S2 subunit mediates

133

fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane (2, 16). The four domains

134

within S1 include N-terminal domain (NTD), RBD and two subdomains (SD1 and

135

SD2) where the latter are positioned adjacent to the S1/S2 cleavage site. Hinge-like

136

movements of the RBD give rise to two distinct conformational states referred to as

137

the “close” and “open”, where close corresponds to the receptor-inaccessible state and

138

open corresponds to the receptor-accessible state, which is supposed to be metastable

139

(17-20). Cryo-EM characterization of the stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain in

140

complex with the H014 Fab fragment revealed that the complex adopts three distinct

141

conformational states, corresponding to one RBD open + two RBDs closed (state 1),

142

two RBDs open + one RBD closed (state 2) and all three open RBDs (state 3) (Fig.

143

2A). Interestingly, structure of the completely closed (state 4) SARS-CoV-2 S trimer

144

without any Fab bound was also observed during 3D classification of the cryo-EM

145

data, albeit in the presence of excessive Fab, suggesting that the binding sites of H014

146

are exposed through protein “breathing” followed by a stochastic RBD movement

147

(Fig. 2A). We determined asymmetric cryo-EM reconstructions of the 4 states at 3.4 –

148

3.6 Å (figs. S3-S6 and table S1). However, the electron potential maps for binding

149

interface between RBD and H014 are relatively weak due to conformational

150

heterogeneity. To solve this problem, focusing classification and refinement by using

151

a “block-based” reconstruction approach were performed to further improve the local

152

resolution up to 3.9 Å, enabling reliable analysis of the interaction mode (fig. S5-S6).

153

Detailed analysis of the interactions between H014 and S was done using the binding

154

interface structure.

155

H014 recognizes a conformational epitope on one side of the open RBD, only

156

involving protein/protein contacts, distinct from the receptor-binding motif (RBM)

157

(Fig. 2B). The H014 paratope constitutes all six complementary determining region

158

(CDR) loops (CDRL1-3 and CDRH1-3) and unusual the heavy-chain frame work

159

(HF-R, residues 58-65) that forge tight interactions with the RBD, resulting in a

160

buried area of ~1,000 Å2 (Fig. 2C). Variable domains of the light-chain and

161

heavy-chain contribute ~32% and 68% of the buried surface area, respectively,

162

through hydrophobic and hydrophilic contacts. The H014 epitope is composed of 21

163

residues, primarily locating in the 2-2-2 (residues 368-386), 3 (residues 405-408,

164

411-413), 4 (residue 439) and 4 (residues 503) regions, which construct a cavity on

165

one side of the RBD (Fig. 2B, 2D and fig. S7). The 12-residue long CDRH3 inserts

166

into this cavity and the hydrophobic residues (YDPYYVM) enriched CDRH3

167

contacts the 3 and edge of the five-stranded -sheet ( 2) region of the RBD (Fig.

168

2D). Tight bindings between the RBD and H014 are primarily due to extensive

169

hydrophobic interactions contributed by two patches: one formed by F54 from

170

CDRH2, Y101 from CDRH3 and A411, P412 and Y508 of the RBD and the other

171

composed of Y49 from CDRL2, P103, Y104, Y105 from CDRH3 and V407, V503

172

and Y508 of the RBD (Fig. 2E and table S2). Additionally, hydrophilic contacts from

173

CDRH1 and HF-R further enhance the RBD-H014 interactions, leading to an

174

extremely high binding affinity at sub nM level at temperatures of 25 °C or 37 °C (Fig.

175

2E and fig. S8). Residues comprising the epitope are mostly conserved with 3

176

single-site mutants (R408I, N439K and V503F) in this region among currently

177

circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains reported (fig. S9). In addition, a number of

178

SARS-CoV-2 isolates bear a common mutation V367F in the RBD (21), which lies

179

adjacent to the major epitope patch 2- 2- 2. Constructs of the recombinant RBD

180

harboring point mutations of above residues and other reported substitutions exhibited

181

an indistinguishable binding affinity to H014 (fig. S10), suggesting that H014 may

182

exhibit broad neutralization activities against SARS-CoV-2 strains currently

183

circulating worldwide. Out of the 21 residues in the H014 epitope, 17 (81 %) are

184

identical between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (fig. S9), which explains the

185

cross-reactivity and comparable binding affinities.

186

To investigate whether H014 interferes with the binding of RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 or

187

SARS-CoV to ACE2, we performed competitive binding assays at both protein and

188

cellular levels. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) indicated that

189

H014 was able to compete with recombinant ACE2 for binding to RBDs of

190

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with EC50 values of 0.7 nM and 5 nM, respectively

191

(Fig. 3A). Additionally, H014 efficiently blocked both the attachment of SARS-CoV-2

192

RBD to ACE2 expressing 293T cells and the binding of recombinant ACE2 to

193

SARS-CoV-2 S expressing 293T cells (Fig. 3B). To verify its potential full occlusion

194

on trimeric S, we conducted two sets of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays by

195

exposing the trimeric S to H014 first and then to ACE2 or the other way around. As

196

expected, binding of H014 completely blocked the attachment of ACE2 to trimeric S.

197

Moreover, ACE2 could be displaced from trimeric S and replaced by H014 (Fig. 3C).

198

To further verify these results in a cell-based viral infection model, real time RT-PCR

199

analysis was carried out to quantify the amount of virus remaining on the host cell

200

surface, which were exposed to antibodies pre- or post-virus attachment to cells at

201

4 °C. H014 efficiently prevented attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to the cell surface in a

202

dose-dependent manner and the viral particles that had already bound to the cell

203

surface could be partially stripped by H014 (Fig. 3D). Superimposition of the

204

structure of the H014-SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S complex over the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2

205

RBD complex structure revealed clashes between the ACE2 and H014, arising out of

206

an overlap of the regions belonging to the binding sites located at the apical helix (4)

207

of the RBD (Fig. 3E). This observation differs substantially from those of most known

208

SARS RBD-targeted antibody complexes, where the antibodies directly recognize the

209

RBM (22-25). Thus, the ability of H014 to prevent SARS-CoV-2 from attaching to

210

host cells can be attributed to steric clashes with ACE2.

211
212

Similar to the RBM, the H014 epitope is only accessible in the open state, indicative

213

of a role akin to the RBM – involving dynamic interferences in interactions with host

214

cells. Our structures together with previously reported coronavirus S structures, not

215

including human coronavirus HKU1 (20), have observed the breathing of the S1

216

subunit, that mediates the transition between “close” and “open” conformation (Fig.

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.02.129098; this version posted June 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

217

4A) (2, 9, 20). In contrast to the hinge-like movement of the RBD observed in most

218

structures, the conformational transition from “close” to “open” observed in our

219

structures mainly involves two steps of rotations: 1) counterclockwise movement of

220

SD1 by ~25° encircling the hinge point (at residue 320); 2) the RBD rotates itself

221

counterclockwise by ~60° (Fig. 4B). These conformational rotations of the SD1 and

222

RBD at proximal points relay an amplified alteration at the distal end, leading to

223

opening up of adequate space for the binding of H014 or ACE2 (Fig. 4B).

224

Ambiguously, the special conformational transition observed in our complex

225

structures results from the engagement of H014 or a synergistic movement of the SD1

226

and RBD.

227
228

Humoral immunity is essential for protection against coronavirus infections and

229

passive immunization of convalescent plasma has been demonstrated to be effective

230

in treating SARS and COVID-19 (12, 26). A number of SARS-CoV specific

231

neutralizing antibodies including m396, 80R and F26G19, have been previously

232

reported to engage primarily the RBM core (residues 484-492 in SARS-CoV)

233

provided that the RBD is in open conformation (Fig. 4C and 4D) (24, 27, 28).

234

Unexpectedly, none of these antibodies has so far demonstrated impressive

235

neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 (7, 8). S230, a SARS-CoV neutralizing

236

antibody that functionally mimics receptor attachment and promotes membrane fusion,

237

despite requiring an open state of the RBD as well, recognizes a small patch at the top

238

of the RBM (Fig. 4C and 4D) (17). Recently, two other antibodies (CR3022 and S309)

239

originating from the memory B cells of SARS survivors in 2003, demonstrated strong

240

binding to SARS-CoV-2 (9, 10). Surprisingly, CR3022 failed to neutralize

241

SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, which could be attributed to the fact that CR3022 binds a

242

cryptic epitope, which is distal from the RBD and is only accessible when at least two

243

RBDs are in the open state. Furthermore, CR3022 does not compete with ACE2 for

244

binding to the RBD (Fig. 4C and 4D) (9). By contrast, S309, a more recently reported

245

neutralizing mAb against both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, recognizes a conserved

246

glycan-containing epitope accessible in both the open and closed states of SARS-CoV

247

and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs (10). The neutralization mechanism of S309 does not depend

248

on direct blocking of receptor binding, but it induces antibody-dependent cell

249

cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). We

250

reported a potent therapeutic antibody H014, which can cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2

251

and SARS-CoV infections by blocking attachment of the virus to the host cell (Fig. 3).

252

Distinct from other antibodies, H014 binds one full side of the RBD, spanning from

253

the proximal  2 to the distal edge of the RBM and possesses partially overlapping

254

epitopes with SARS-CoV specific antibodies like m392, 80R, F26G19, CR3022 and

255

S309 (Fig. 4C and 4D). Although both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 utilize ACE2 to

256

enter host cells, high sequence variations in the RBM and local conformational

257

rearrangements at the distal end of the RBM from the two viruses have been observed

258

(8). These probably lead to the failure of some antibodies, especially those targeting

259

the RBM of SARS-CoV, in cross-binding and cross-neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. Three

260

cross-reactive antibodies (CR3022, S309 and H014) recognize more conserved

261

epitopes located beyond the RBM, amongst which the CR3022 epitope is most distant

262

from the RBM (Fig. 4C and 4D), suggesting a possible reason for its inability to

263

neutralize SARS-CoV-2. H014 binds more conserved epitopes, some of which are in

264

close proximity to the RBM, rendering it effective in cross-neutralizing lineage B

265

viruses. Additionally, antibodies recognizing more conserved patches beyond the

266

RBM would function synergistically with antibodies targeting the RBM to enhance

267

neutralization activities, which could mitigate the risk of viral escape. The molecular

268

features of H014 epitopes unveiled in this study facilitate the discovery of broad

269

cross-neutralizing epitopes within lineage B and pose interesting targets for

270

structure-based rational vaccine design. Our studies also highlight the promise of

271

antibody-based therapeutic interventions for the treatment of COVID-19.

Fig. 4 Breathing of the S1 subunit and epitopes of neutralizing antibodies

630

(A) H014 can only interact with the “open” RBD, whereas the “closed” RBD is

631

inaccessible to H014. The “open” RBD and RBD bound H014 are depicted in

632

lighter colors corresponding to the protein chain they belong to. Color scheme is

633

the same as in Fig. 2A. (B) Structural rearrangements of the S1 subunit of

634

SARS-CoV-2 transition from the closed state to the open state. SD1: subdomain 1,

635

SD2: subdomain 2, RBD’: RBD (closed state) from adjacent monomer. SD1, SD2,

636

NTD, RBD and RBD’ are colored in pale green, light orange, cyan, blue and yellow,

637

respectively. The red dot indicates the hinge point. The angles between the RBD

638

and SD1 are labeled. (C) Epitope location analysis of neutralizing antibodies on

639

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S trimers. The S trimer structures with one RBD

640

open and two RBD closed from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were used to show

641

individual epitope information, which is highlighted in green. The accessible and

642

in-accessible states are encircled and marked by green ticks and red crosses. (D)

643

Footprints of the seven mAbs on RBDs of SARS-CoV (left) and SARS-CoV-2

644

(right). RBDs are rendered as molecular surfaces in light blue. Footprints of

645

different mAbs are highlighted in different colors as labeled in the graph. Note:

646

epitopes recognized by indicated antibodies are labeled in blue (non-overlapped),

647

yellow (overlapped once) and red (overlapped twice).
