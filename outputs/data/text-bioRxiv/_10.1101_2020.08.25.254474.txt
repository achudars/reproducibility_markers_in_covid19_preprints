Abstract

8

Six cattle (Bos taurus) were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and kept together with

9

three naïve in-contact animals. Low-level virus replication and a specific sero-reactivity were

10

observed in two inoculated animals, despite the presence of high antibody titers against a bovine

11

betacoronavirus. The in-contact animals did not become infected.

Text
After spill-over from a yet unknown animal host to humans, a global pandemic of an

16

acute respiratory disease referred to as “coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)” started in

17

Wuhan, China, in December 2019 (1, 2). As causative agent, a novel coronavirus designated

18

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified (3). Since the

19

beginning of the pandemic, the role of livestock and wildlife species at the human-animal

20

interface was discussed, with a special focus on the identification of susceptible species and

21

potential reservoir or intermediate hosts. Until now, natural or experimental infections

22

demonstrated the susceptibility of fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), ferrets, felids, dogs and

23

minks, while pigs, chicken and ducks could not be infected (4-6). Besides ducks, chicken and

24

pigs, major livestock species with close contact to humans are ruminants including a global

25

population of ca. 1.5 Billion of cattle. In bovines, non-SARS betacoronaviruses are widespread

26

(7, 8) with seroprevalences reaching up to 90% (9). The course of infection is usually subclinical

27

(7). However, it is yet unknown whether any ruminant species including cattle is susceptible to

28

SARS-CoV-2 infection or whether there is any cross-reactivity of antibodies against bovine

29

coronaviruses (BCoV) to SARS-CoV-2.

This study

32

To examine the susceptibility of cattle for SARS-CoV-2 and to characterize the course of

33

infection under experimental conditions, six 4-5 months old, male Holstein-Friesian dairy calves

34

were intranasally inoculated under BSL3-conditions with 1x105 tissue culture infectious dose

50% (TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2 strain “2019_nCoV Muc-IMB-1” (GISAID

ID_EPI_ISL_406862, designation “hCoV-19/Germany/BavPat1/2020”) at 1ml per nostril, using

37

a vaporization device (Teleflex Medical, Germany). 24 hours after inoculation three contact

38

cattle, that were separated prior to infection, were re-introduced. Body temperature and clinical

39

signs were monitored daily and nasal, oral and rectal swabs were taken on days -1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,

40

12 and 20, and blood samples on days -1, 6, 12 and 20 after infection.

41

Swabs (Medical Wire & Equipment, UK) were immediately resuspended in 1.25ml

42

serum-free cell culture medium supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, gentamycin, and

43

amphotericin B. Nucleic acid was extracted from 100µl of swab fluid using the NucleoMag Vet

44

kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany), and subsequently tested by the real-time RT-PCR “nCoV_IP4”

45

targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene (10). Positive results were

46

confirmed by a second real-time RT-PCR based on an E gene target (11). Serum samples were

47

tested by indirect immunofluorescence (iIFA) and virus neutralization assays (VNT) against

48

SARS-CoV-2 as described before (5), and by an ELISA based on the receptor-binding domain

49

(RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 (12). In addition, the sera were investigated by iIFA using CRFK cells

50

(L0115, collection of cell lines in veterinary medicine (CCLV), Insel Riems) infected with

51

BCoV strain Nebraska as antigen matrix and by VNT against this BCoV strain on MBDK cells

52

(L0261, CCLV).

53

All animals tested negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in swab samples and

54

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in serum prior to infection. None of the inoculated cattle, nor

55

any of the contact animals showed any clinical, disease-related symptoms. Body temperature,

56

feed intake and general condition remained in a physiological range throughout the study.

57

However, two of the inoculated animals became productively infected demonstrated by the

58

detection of viral RNA in nasal swabs. One animal (number 776) tested positive on days 2 and 3

59

after inoculation with quantification cycle (Cq) values of 29.97 (day 2) and 33.79 (day 3), and

60

another calf (number 768) on day 3 only (Cq 38.13) (Figure 1A). These animals scored positive

61

only in the nasal swabs. Oral and rectal swabs taken simultaneously, as well as specimens

62

collected from every other animal, remained negative throughout the study period.

63

Serum samples were tested with a SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific indirect ELISA. An

64

increase in reactivity was observed for animal 776 from day 12 onwards (Figure 1B) indicating

65

seroconversion. Serum taken on day 20 from this animal confirmed the positive ELISA findings

66

with a low iIFA titer of 1:4, and a visible, although not complete, inhibition of viral replication in

67

VNT (serum dilution 1:2). Animal 768 showed only a slightly increased ELISA-reactivity at day

68

20, while iIFA and VNT remained negative. This could be related to the test sensitivity or a

69

possible restriction of replication to the upper respiratory tract.

70
71
72

The other animals remained negative throughout the study in all applied SARS-CoV-2specific serological tests.
In addition, the BCoV status of the cattle was tested. As confirmed by VNT, all animals

73

had neutralizing antibodies against BCoV prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the titers differed

74

markedly between individual animals (Figure 1D). Surprisingly, three animals showed an

75

increase in antibody titers against BCoV in iIFA and two also in the VNT (Figure 1). In order to

76

exclude an effect of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, nasal swabs were tested for BCoV by a generic

77

RdRp-based RT-PCR (13). Animal 842 reacted positive one day prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection

78

and 2 days post infection. The presence of a non-SARS-BCoV, which induced the increase in the

79

anti-BCoV titer in this animal (Figure 1) and presumably infected animal 774, was confirmed by

80

sequencing. However, no interference of the bovine coronavirus with the applied SARS-CoV-2

81

tests was observed, since all animals tested negative in SARS-CoV-2 tests prior to infection

82

(Figure 1). Hence, there is presumably no detectable serological cross-reactivity between BCoV

83

and SARS-CoV-2 in the used assays. Moreover, two animals with high BCoV sero-response

84

were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA after inoculation, whereas those with lower BCoV-

85

specific titers could not be infected, further confirming a lack of any cross-reactivity or cross-

86

protection.

87

In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that under our experimental conditions cattle

88

show low susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, since two out of six animals appear to be infected as

89

demonstrated by SARS-CoV-2-genome detection in nasal swabs and specific seroconversion.

90

However, there is no indication that cattle play any role in the human pandemic nor are there

91

reports of naturally infected bovines. This correlates with the rather low genome loads we

92

detected after experimental intranasal infection of cattle and the absence of transmission to any

93

of the direct in-contact animals. Nevertheless, in regions with high numbers of cattle and high

94

case numbers in humans, like the US or South America, close contact between livestock and

95

infected animal owners or caretakers could lead to anthropo-zoonotic infections of cattle, as it

96

was already described for highly susceptible animal species like mink, felids or dogs (6, 14).

97

Besides, age, husbandry practices and underlying health conditions of the animals should be

98

considered, when assessing the risk of virus circulation within bovine populations. Hence, cattle

99

may be included in outbreak investigations if there is any indication of direct contact to SARS-

100

CoV-2, e.g. by infected farmers or staff. Beside direct detection by PCR, serological screenings

101

with sensitive and specific ELISA-systems should also be taken into consideration. In this

102

context, the wide distribution of another coronavirus in cattle is of special interest, especially

103

since the presence of one virus did not protect from infection with another betacoronavirus in

104

this study. Double infections of individual animals might potentially lead to recombination

105

events between SARS-CoV-2 and BCoV, a phenomenon already described for other pandemic

106

coronaviruses (15). A resulting chimeric virus, comprising characteristics of both primarily

107

respiratory viruses, could present an additional threat for both human and livestock populations

108

and should therefore be monitored.
