ABSTRACT

20

Inactivated viral preparations are important resources in vaccine and antisera industry.

21

Of the many vaccines that are being developed against COVID-19, inactivated whole-

22

virus vaccines are also considered effective. β-propiolactone (BPL) is a widely used

23

chemical inactivator of several viruses. Here, we analyze various concentrations of BPL

24

to effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and their effects on the biochemical properties of

25

the virion particles. BPL at 1:2000 (v/v) concentrations effectively inactivated SARS-

26

CoV-2. However, higher BPL concentrations resulted in the loss of both protein content

27

as well as the antigenic integrity of the structural proteins. Higher concentrations also

28

caused substantial aggregation of the virion particles possibly causing undesirable

29

outcomes including a potential immune escape by infectious virions, and a loss in

30

antigenic potential. We also identify that the viral RNA content in the culture

31

supernatants can be a direct indicator of their antigenic content. Our findings may have

32

important implications in the vaccine and antisera industry during COVID-19 pandemic.

INTRODUCTION

34

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is

35

devastating the human lives across the globe [1, 2]. As of the middle of April 2021, the

36

virus is estimated to have infected about 140 million people, killing over 3 million of

37

them worldwide. The disease is characterized by acute respiratory illness resulting in

38

severe breathing difficulties very similar to the common flu accompanied by severe

39

cough in the infected people forcing several of them to be hospitalized. In addition, there

40

have been several reports of sepsis, blood clotting and multi-organ failure in several

41

persons infected by the virus. The severity of the disease is significantly higher in

42

persons with co-morbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer and

43

respiratory problems [2, 3]. Currently, there are no drugs that can cure COVID-19.

44

Vaccines are the best hopes for ending this pandemic. Antibody-based interventional

45

therapies are of great importance in treating severe cases. Some of these projects

46

utilize inactivated virus particles that are used for immunization along with adjuvants.

47

Large-scale viral cultures and antigens are essential for successful generation of

48

vaccines and antisera that are based on whole virus-derived antigens. This requires

49

complete inactivation of the virus particles while causing minimum damage to their

50

structural and antigenic properties. Therefore, these projects are dependent on the

51

availability of viral samples that are totally inactivated while retaining their antigenicity

52

sufficient to induce antibody response.

53

Several methods have been adapted historically to inactivate the viral stocks that are

54

used for vaccine and antisera development. They include physical methods such as

55

heat [4] and γ-rays [5] or chemical agents such as formaldehyde and β-propiolactone

56

(BPL) [6-8]. SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be inactivated by temperatures starting from

57

56 °C [9, 10]. BPL mediated inactivation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 has been

58

demonstrated [7, 9, 11, 12]. Heating is known to denature the proteins that might

59

negatively impact their antigenicity [4]. γ -irradiation has been employed in several

60

vaccine studies, but they are also known to damage the antigens if not properly

61

optimized [13]. Formaldehyde, despite being one of the oldest and most easily available

62

chemical agents to inactivate viruses, also causes loss in protein antigenicity and hence

63

is less desirable. BPL has emerged as a very popular chemical agent in various vaccine

64

initiatives due to its high inactivation potency and relatively low damage of antigens.

65

BPL has also been used in SARS-CoV-2 inactivation at various concentrations.

66

However, a comprehensive analysis of its potency and impact on the integrity of viral

67

antigen is not available. In this study, we attempt to optimize the concentration of BPL

68

for SARS-CoV-2 for efficient inactivation and protection of antigenicity. We demonstrate

69

that BPL at 1:2000 concentrations (v/v) is enough to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and

70

increasing the BPL concentration above 1:1000 leads to significant drop in the antigenic

71

potential of viral proteins, probably caused by the modifications on their amino acids.

72

Our investigation also identified a lack of correlation between viral RNA titer and

73

infectious viral units in the supernatant. However, the viral RNA titer showed strong

74

correlation with the antigenic content in the sample. Our studies also demonstrate that

75

SARS-CoV-2 particles tend to form larger aggregates with increasing concentrations of

76

BPL above 1:1000 which could possibly lead to reduced epitope exposure thereby

77

deleteriously affecting the antigenic potential of the sample.

Virus culturing

89

The oro- and nasopharyngeal patient swabs transported in VTM were screened using

90

SARS-CoV-2 specific primers (LabGenomics; Labgun COVID-19 RT-PCR kit;

91

CV9032B) and the samples with low Ct (less than 20) values were chosen to culture

92

virus. VTMs were filter-sterilized and added to Vero monolayers in 96-well plate. Three

93

hours post-infection, the media was replaced with fresh serum sufficient media. The

94

infected cells were further incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber and

95

cytopathic effects (CPE) were examined every 24 hours. Cells along with the

96

supernatants were collected from those wells displaying CPE and transferred to fresh

97

12-well plate containing Vero monolayers for further propagation. This process was

98

repeated until the cell culture supernatant showed a Ct value lesser than 20. The

99

supernatants were titrated for infectious particle count by plaque-forming assay. In the

100

case of dry-swab sample, the swab was first soaked in TE buffer for 30 minutes [14]

101

and further stored at -80°C freezers. Later the sample was used as inoculum for

102

infection similar to VTM.

103

Virus quantification, titration, and sequencing

104

RNA from VTMs or swab-immersed TE buffer or cell culture supernatant was isolated

105

using viral RNA isolation kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL GmbH & Co. KG; 740956.250). The

106

SARS-CoV2 RNA was quantified using (LabGun™ COVID-19 RT-PCR Kit) following

107

the manufacturer's protocol or following WHO guidelines using SuperScript™ III

108

Platinum™ One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (ThermoFisher) and Taqman probes against CoV-2

109

E, and RdRP (Eurofins Scientific). The isolates that were established in cultures were

110

sequenced by next-generation sequencing and compared with Wuhan SARS-CoV-2

genome as reference S. The sequence of isolates used for all the experiments here

112

were submitted to GISAID public database (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_458075; virus ID-

113

114

19/India/TG-CCMB-L1021/2020). Subsequently, the CCMB_O2 isolate was scaled up

115

and used for the experiments. All the virus cultures were titrated for infectious particle

116

count using plaque forming assay (PFU/mL) before use. Briefly, the supernatant was

117

log-diluted from 10-1 to 10-7 in serum-free media and was added to a 100% confluent

118

monolayer of Vero cells. Two hours post-infection the infection inoculum was replaced

119

with agar media (one part of 1% LMA mixed with one part of 2 × DMEM with 5% FBS

120

and 1% Pen-Strep). 6-7 days post-infection cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in 1×

121

PBS and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The dilution which had 5-20 plaque was used

122

for calculating PFU/mL.

123

Virus infection and inactivation

124

Cells were infected with SARS-CoV2 at 90% confluency in serum-free media at 1MOI

125

for two hours and subsequently, the inoculum was replaced with fresh serum-free

126

media. Three days post-infection, cell culture supernatant was collected and the debris

127

was removed by centrifugation and stored until further use. Later, the infectious viruses

128

in the supernatants were inactivated using BPL at varying concentrations (1:250, 500,

129

1000, 2000 (v/v to the culture-media). In brief, the supernatant with BPL was incubated

130

at 4°C for 16 hours followed by 4-hour incubation at 37°C to hydrolyze the remaining

131

BPL. The inactivation of the virus was confirmed by the absence of CPE in three

132

consecutive rounds of infections. To study the effect of BPL on viral antigenicity, either

133

live infectious or inactivated viral samples were concentrated to 10 × using centrifugal

134

filter units with 100 kDa cut-off.

135

Zinc Staining

136

All the reagents provided by the manufacturer (Reversible Zinc Stain; G Biosciences)

137

were diluted to working concentration using deionized water. Zinc staining was done

138

after performing SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Viral supernatants concentrated

139

either by ultracentrifugation or by centrifugal filters were lysed with equal volume of 2

140

× lysis buffer (containing 2% NP40, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM sodium

141

orthovanadate, 2 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate,

142

and protease inhibitor cocktail) [15], mixed with 6 × Laemmli buffer, boiled and loaded

143

onto the gels after cooling. Gels were washed with distilled water after electrophoresis

144

followed by incubation in 25 mL washing buffer (Reagent I) for 5 minutes on a shaking

145

platform. Subsequently, the gel was incubated with 25 mL of Reagent II containing

146

imidazole for 15 minutes. Finally, the gel was stained in zinc sulfate-containing Reagent

147

III for 45-60 seconds followed by immediate transfer to distilled water. The gel image

148

was scanned against a dark background and was then destained using destaining

149

solution provided by the manufacturer followed by three 5-minute washes using distilled

150

water. The destained gel was used for subsequent western blot transfer procedures.

151

Immunoblotting

152

Fresh gels or the destained gels after zinc staining were transferred onto PVDF

153

membranes for 16 hours at 30 V. Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA and were

154

subsequently probed with SARS-CoV-2-specific Nucleocapsid (1:8000) or SARS Spike

155

(1:2000) antibodies. HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody was used at

1:20000 dilutions. Blots were then developed with ECL reagents (Clarity ECL Western

157

Blotting; Bio-Rad) using ChemiDoc MP system (Bio-Rad). All densitometric analyses

158

were performed using ImageJ software [16].

159

Dynamic light scattering spectroscopy

160

The particle size of virions from BPL inactivated viral samples was measured using a

161

dynamic light scattering instrument (SpectroSize 300; Nabitec). The instrument uses a

162

laser diode and operates at a wavelength of 660 nm at 90° scattering angle and

163

detection was done by an avalanche photodiode detector. Each BPL inactivated sample

164

was subjected to twenty measurements to obtain the particle size. The data obtained

165

was analyzed using SpectroSize 300 software that provided the average hydrodynamic

166

size distribution profiles. The average size of the particles from each sample was plotted

167

against the dilution of BPL used. The experiment was repeated in triplicate using

168

samples with different Ct values.

RESULTS

179

Establishment of SARS-CoV-2 cultures

180

Several other articles have described methods for the establishment of SARS-CoV-2

181

cultures [17-20]. Here, the key is to have access to patient oro- or nasopharyngeal

182

samples in viral transport medium (VTM) that display low Ct values in the quantitative

183

real time RT-PCR assays. The association of the viral load estimated by qRT-PCR with

184

COVID severity is controversial [21, 22], and qRT-PCR-generated Ct values of viral

185

genes are not true indicators of the viral load owing to a large number of variables in

186

sample collection and processing and hence could be deceptive at times. Therefore it is

187

important to try several VTM samples that display Ct values below 30. Even though

188

lower Ct values are indicators of high viral load, several samples with low Ct values

189

could not establish a culture. This could primarily be determined by the infectious viral

190

load in the sample that is dependent on the collection process and the post-collection

191

storage conditions. Samples that did show signs of infection in a small scale (96-well set

192

up) were then gradually expanded to larger scale to maintain a constant

193

viral culture for further experiments. Each passage of virus was tested for viral load and

194

titer to ensure the retention of infectivity (Table 1).

195

Recently, RNA extraction from the swab samples was shown to be dispensable thereby

196

enabling direct processing of the samples for qRT-PCR in COVID-19 screening [14] as

197

well as in other respiratory viral infections [23, 24]. Collecting the samples in dry-swab

198

form has been demonstrated to be effective in preserving the viral content and also

199

much more bio-safe [23, 24]. The dry swabs were immersed in TE buffer before using

200

directly in qRT-PCR. However, the dry-swab method has a potential risk of inactivating

201

the virus due to long-term dry conditions. We tested if virus cultures can be established

202

from the dry-swab samples resuspended in TE buffer stored at -80°C. As in the case of

203

VTM, the potential samples were incubated with Vero cells for infection. Interestingly, as

204

demonstrated in Table 1, we successfully isolated SARS-CoV-2 from dry-swab

205

collection sample, indicating that virus particles derived from dry-swab method can be

206

viable and can indeed establish infection.

207

Ct values do not correlate with infectivity, but with protein content

208

Several studies have used Ct values as a measure of viral titer in the culture

209

supernatants [25, 26]. During our studies, we encountered numerous instances where

210

low Ct values do not really translate into a high viral titer (Figure 1A). Supernatants with

211

Ct values differing significantly, displayed comparable viral titers. We often came across

212

samples with low Ct values and low infectious titers and also those with relatively higher

213

Ct but with high viral titers. Large majority of the established culture supernatants had

214

infectious titers around 107 PFU/mL but their Ct values ranged from 10-28, clearly

215

pointing to a substantially large fraction of viral RNA contributed by non-infectious viral

216

particles or non-virion associated viral RNA. However, samples with low Ct values

217

corresponded to high viral protein content (Figure 1B) suggesting that the samples with

218

low Ct values and low titers contained larger amounts of defective and noninfectious

219

viral particles that contributed to the higher protein content. Thus, the samples with low

220

Ct values are ideal for the preparation of antigens irrespective of their infectious viral

221

units.

Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by BPL

223

BPL is a common reagent used for chemical inactivation of viruses [6, 27, 28]. We

224

titrated the optimal concentration of BPL required for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. BPL

225

was added to viral supernatants with known infectious titer (PFU/mL) to make final

226

dilutions of 1:2000, 1:1000, 1:500 and 1:250 (all v/v). Infectivity of the supernatants was

227

measured by CPE. Our results demonstrate that BPL was consistently effective in

228

inactivating the virus completely even at 1:2000 dilutions. Three consecutive rounds of

229

infection confirmed total inactivation of virus at these concentrations (Table 2; Figure 2).

230

These results indicate that BPL at 1:2000 concentrations is strong enough to inactivate

231

SARS-CoV-2 efficiently.

232

BPL inactivation causes damage to SARS-CoV-2 antigens

233

One of the major requirements of BPL inactivation is in vaccine studies. However, BPL

234

treatment consistently interfered with the quantification of viral protein. BPL is known to

235

damage the genetic content, but its influence on the proteins of the virions is less

236

understood [29]. In addition, if BPL damages structural proteins of the virions, this could

237

be less desirable for vaccine studies. To address this issue, we tested the epitope

238

integrity of SARS-CoV-2 virions inactivated with BPL. Viral supernatants treated with

239

BPL at 1:250 dilutions were concentrated 10 × by filters with 100kDa cut-off

240

membranes. Protein lysates prepared from these concentrates were electrophoresed by

241

SDS-PAGE following which the gels were zinc stained to visualize antigens. BPL

242

treatment caused minimal drop in the total protein content in the samples as

243

demonstrated in Figure 3 A and B. Next, we studied the effect on antigenicity by

244

detecting structural proteins spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) by immunoblotting.

245

Immunoblotting against S and N was used as a proxy measure of the antigenic integrity

246

of the virions. Any drop in the band intensity would be considered as the outcome of

247

potential damage to the epitopes. The immunoblots revealed a substantial loss of

248

signals in BPL treated samples against the untreated, infectious samples (Figure 3 C

249

and D) suggested that BPL treatment is causing the loss of antigenic integrity in addition

250

to causing loss in the protein content.

251

In order to further substantiate this point, we treated the viral supernatants with varying

252

concentrations of BPL at 1:2000, 1:1000, 1:500 and 1:250 dilutions. Supporting our

253

initial observations, loss in the signal was the most striking in sample with 1:250 BPL

254

concentrations followed by 1:500 (Figure 4A). BPL caused much less loss at 1:1000

255

and 1:2000 dilutions. This was further strengthened by immunoblotting where a gradual

256

loss of antigenic integrity was remarkably captured in 1:250 dilutions (Figure 4B). This

257

could be caused either by a possible chemical modification of amino acids in the

258

epitopes or by the potential loss of exposure of epitopes caused by aggregation. These

259

results collectively demonstrate that BPL treatment causes loss in protein content and

260

also a further loss in antigenicity and suggest that using 1:2000 or 1:1000 dilutions

261

would be more appropriate for vaccine studies.

262

BPL treatment causes aggregation of SARS-CoV-2

263

Earlier studies have demonstrated that BPL treatment causes aggregation of virus

264

particles [6]. To test whether SARS-CoV-2 undergoes aggregation during BPL

265

treatment, we used dynamic light scattering (DLS) that can study particle size

266

distribution in a suspension. Viral supernatants treated with varying concentrations of

267

BPL were analyzed by DLS. Interestingly, increasing concentrations of BPL induced the

268

formation of larger aggregates as demonstrated in Figure 5 A-D. While the viral particles

in the supernatant with BPL at 1:2000 dilutions had an average size of about 160nm

270

their size gradually increased to over 500nm with 1:250 concentration of BPL (Figure

271

5E). These results demonstrate that BPL causes aggregation of SARS-CoV-2 particles

in a concentration-dependent manner. Increased aggregation of virions could result in

273

significant loss in the exposure of the epitopes and hence would render them less

274

suitable for antibody response. Additionally, filtration of the mixture post-BPL treatment

275

is not advisable as it might cause significant loss of virion aggregates. Increased

276

aggregation coupled with lower exposure of viral proteins indicates that higher

277

concentrations of BPL are not optimal for inactivation of virus.

278

DISCUSSION

279

In this study, we focused on characterizing the methods for preparation of large

280

volumes of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 cultures for therapeutic purposes such as vaccine

281

and antisera production. Since BPL is the mode of choice for inactivation of several

282

microbes, we optimized the concentration and studied the impact of the treatment on

283

the epitopes and virus aggregation. We demonstrate that BPL at 1:2000 (v/v) dilutions

284

in the culture supernatant is sufficient to totally inactivate the virus. Our studies suggest

285

that BPL negatively impacts the antigenic potential of the virus thereby potentially

286

affecting the immune response when used as antigens. However, lower concentration

287

of BPL at 1:2000 concentrations had minimal impact on the antigenic integrity in

288

comparison with higher concentration suggesting that at this concentration, antigenic

289

response should be robust.

290

Since BPL treatment impacted the antigenic potential of S and N, we speculate that it

291

must be causing chemical modifications of amino acids. Similar reports have been

292

made in the case of influenza and coxsackie viruses [6, 30] suggesting that BPL might

293

be interfering with the integrity of the structural proteins of the virion. In agreement with

294

this data, protein quantitation of the BPL treated viral samples always failed to show

295

reproducible results (data not shown). Highly sensitive BCA method detected proteins in

296

the viral samples, albeit in highly irreproducible manner. We demonstrate that viral

297

proteins from such samples could be detected by the Zinc negative staining in SDS-

298

PAGE and could be used for relative quantitation.

299

Our study demonstrates a clear dichotomy between the Ct values and infectious viral

300

count in any given stock. While the Ct values are representatives of the levels of viral

301

RNA, the plaque assays are direct indicators of the infectivity of the stocks. Our studies

302

demonstrate a lack of correlation between the Ct and PFU values, and a strong

303

correlation between low Ct values and high viral antigens, pointing to the possibility of

304

the presence of a large fraction of non-infectious virus particles in these samples.

305

Having lower infectious titer may not necessarily be a deterrent for samples used in

306

immunizations given that they have high antigenic content. Our results suggest that

307

samples with low Ct and low infectious titers can therefore be used for immunization

308

purposes provided they have good antigenic contents.

309

While cytopathic effect (CPE) is a clear indication of the viral replication, we observed

310

that several cultures that harbored very high titer virus did not display a CPE during the

311

early part of viral culturing. On the other hand, a few cultures that displayed CPE could

312

not establish viral cultures. Therefore, it is important to monitor the presence of the virus

313

in the supernatant by qRT-PCR. If the cultures do not display CPE, qRT-PCR could be

314

optimally performed at a week from the time of infection.

315

Our finding on the aggregation of SARS CoV-2 particles has significance in the vaccine

316

and antisera industry. Studies have reported an association between aggregation and

317

loss of antigenicity [31-33]. Another concern is the incomplete inactivation due to

318

aggregation and the potential escape of virus from inactivation resulting in the presence

319

of infectious viruses in vaccine with a potential for infection [34]. However, our studies

320

could not detect any traces of infectious virus after three rounds of consecutive

321

infections. Nevertheless, total inactivation is achieved even at 1:2000 concentrations

322

and hence higher concentrations of BPL are well avoidable.

323

CONCLUSION

324

We have successfully established culturing of multiple isolates of SARS-CoV-2 from

325

patient samples including the modified dry-swab method of collection. We optimized the

326

optimal concentrations of BPL for complete inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. Our studies

327

identified those concentrations of BPL higher than 1:1000 results in aggregation of viral

328

particles and also loss in the antigenic potential of the sample. Our studies would

329

provide a good guiding material for antisera and vaccine studies.

performed by BPL at 1:250 concentrations. The concentrated samples were lysed in

570

equal volumes of 2 × protein lysis buffer, mixed with 6 × Laemmli buffer, boiled and

571

loaded into the gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained following the

572

instructions provided by the manufacturer. (B) Relative protein contents in the active
