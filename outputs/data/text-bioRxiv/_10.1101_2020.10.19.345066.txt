Abstract
The ongoing global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 implies a corresponding accumulation of
mutations. Herein the mutational status of 611 genomes from India along with their impact
on proteins was ascertained. After excluding gaps and ambiguous sequences, a total of 493
variable sites (152 parsimony informative and 341 singleton) were observed. The most
prevalent reference nucleotide was C (209) and substituted one was T (293). NSP3 had the
highest incidence of 101 sites followed by S protein (74 sites), NSP12b (43 sites) and ORF3a
(31 sites). The average number of mutations per sample for males and females was 2.56 and
2.88 respectively suggesting a higher contribution of mutations from females. Non-uniform
geographical distribution of mutations implied by Odisha (30 samples, 109 mutations) and
Tamil Nadu (31 samples, 40 mutations) suggests that sequences in some regions are mutating
faster than others. There were 281 mutations (198 ‘Neutral’ and 83 ‘Disease’) affecting
amino acid sequence. NSP13 has a maximum of 14 ‘Disease’ variants followed by S protein
and ORF3a with 13 each. Further, constitution of ‘Disease’ mutations in genomes from
asymptomatic people was mere 11% but those from deceased patients was over three folds
higher at 38% indicating contribution of these mutations to the pathophysiology of the
SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic began from Wuhan, China and has devastated
millions of lives, economies and even nations as a whole. The first reported case was in
December 2019 and as of 1st September 2020, there have been 2,56,21,967 reported cases and
8,54,235 deaths worldwide (www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Of these, 36,21,245 cases
and 64,469 deaths have happened in India making it one of the most affected countries in the
world (www.mygov.in/covid-19).

The causative agent identified for COVID-19 is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which belongs to family Coronaviridae characterized by
single strand positive sense RNA genome. Though this is novel virus but the outbreak is not
the first one from members of Coronaviridae. Previously, severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) coronavirus in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus in
2012 created a scare as they had a relatively higher mortality rate. However, SARS-CoV-2 is
by far the most contagious one [1–4].

The higher incidence of viral infections would imply a faster evolution process for SARSCoV-2 [5]. This is so because more the virus replicates, higher are the chances of it
accumulating mutations with the possibility of it leading to altered dynamics of its virulence,
pathogenesis and interactions with host. The changes may not be necessarily favoring the
virus; however, the unpredictability demands caution.

The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes for 16 non-structural proteins in addition to the replicase
polyprotein, the spike (S) glycoprotein, envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and

other accessory proteins [6]. The impact of mutations in all the regions of the genome needs
to be assessed to understand viral evolution.

With a definitive possibility of India becoming the most affected country by SARS-CoV-2 in
near future and the demographic burden involved, its pertinent to be analyze the
accumulating variations in the genome accounting for possible changes in protein and their
potential to alter the virus in any manner. On 6th June, 2020 we retrieved 611 FASTA
sequence congregations from India along their rational meta data from GISAID EpiCoV
server to construct the phylo-geo-network and analyze the haplogroups along with their
geographical distribution across different states of India [7]. Herein we extend our study
using the same congregation of sequences to analyze the nature and composition of the
observed mutations and their impact on proteins of SARS-CoV-2.

Methodology:
Sequence Congregations Collection:
GISAID EpiCoV is an open access repository of genomic and epidemiologic information
about novel corona viruses from across the world from wherein sequences were extracted and
alignment performed as previously reported [7]. Briefly, 611 FASTA sequence congregations
along their rational meta data from GISAID EpiCoV (www.epicov.org) server. For
mutational profile analysis with clinical correlation, we selected 15 genomes of deceased
patients from existing congregation. However, there were just two genomes for asymptomatic
patients in the congregations. So, on 09.12.2020, we downloaded 775 FASTA sequences with
patient status from the same server and selected 30 genomes from asymptomatic patients. As
the data filter for genome extraction, we used hCoV-19 as a virus name, human as a host,
India as a location and complete sequence with high coverage. Details of the asymptomatic

samples are given in Supplementary file 1. The sequences thus extracted were analyzed with
NC_045512.2 from Wuhan, China as reference.

Nucleotide Analysis
MEGA(v.10) is a multithreaded tool for molecular and evolutionary analysis. Multiple
Sequence Alignment (MSA) of the extracted sequences [7] was initially visualized by this
software then the variable sites are exported into spreadsheets with or without
missing/ambiguous and gap sites along their respective positions [8]. Using this software, we
estimate the MCL (Maximum Composite Likelihood) nucleotide substitution pattern and
Tajima’s Neutrality test to understand transition transversion bias and nucleotide diversity
[9,10]. PIRO IGLSF is a MATLAB-based simulation software, we used this for the identify
the location of mutated nucleotide position on specific gene [11].

Protein Analysis
Coronavirus Typing Tool of Genome Detective (v.1.13) and COVID-19 Genome Annotator
of Coronapp are webtools for analysis of protein and nucleotide mutation [12,13]. We used
these tools for annotation, identification and classification of mutated protein followed by
verification and validation of the positions with the mutated nucleotide sites by the output of
MEGA. The nucleotide similarity percentage was validated by NCBI BLAST
(blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) to investigate the sequence diversity.

Protein Prediction Analysis:
SIFT, PROVEAN and ws-SNPs&GO are the prediction tools which report positive or
negative impact of variants on protein phenotype. The assessments are focused upon scores
using several algorithms. It is expected that a SIFT score of < 0.05 is diseased ("affect protein

−2.5 is diseased ("deleterious"), and > −2.5 is neutral. ws-SNPs&GO 's PHD-SNP method is
estimated to be > 0.5 mutation in the probability of disease, and < 0.5 is neutral [14–16].

Results and Discussion
Composition and distribution of variable sites
The observed MSA length was 29903 bp wherein the variable sites could be extracted
through two different options. If we included gaps and ambiguous sequences, a total of 841
variable sites were observed with a percentage cover of 2.81%, where percentage cover =
[(No of variable site / MSA Length) * 100]. All the sites have been shown in Supplementary
file 2. The Tajima’s D statistic was also analysed (Table 1) and its negative value indicated
the significance of these variable sites.

However, excluding the gaps and ambiguous sequences reduced this percentage cover to
1.65% encompassing 493 variable sites which we have used for subsequent analyses reported
in this study. This included 152 parsimony informative (PI) sites and 341 singleton sites
(SNP: Single nucleotide Polymorphism). The PI sites are those whose incidence was
observed in multiple samples whereas singleton sites had a restricted single sample incidence.
The distribution of these sites according to various substitutions, protein localizations and
impact therein has been summarized in Figure 1, Supplementary file 2. As evident therein,
C→T (181 sites) forms the most prevalent mutation in both PI and singleton sites and G→T
(95 sites) comes a distant second. The common aspect of two most prevalent mutations is “T”
being the substituted nucleotide. Further, there were two multi-variable (MV) sites each in PI
and singleton category wherein two separate mutations were observed at the same site in
different samples. The details of observed MV sites have been summarized in Table 2.

The distribution of the variable sites across proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in a non-uniform
manner is reflective of the differential contributions of proteins in evolution. As per our data,
NSP3 had the maximum of 101 variable sites followed by S protein (74 sites), NSP12b (43
sites) and ORF3a (31 sites) (Figure 1; Supplementary file 2). These four proteins account for
over half of the total variable sites of the genome and may be considered as drivers of
genomic evolution for SARS-CoV-2. The mutations of S protein have been the focus for
multiple research groups owing to its plausible impact on viral entry to the host cell but the
mutations elsewhere may be equally relevant as the viral genome is known to harbor only
what’s essential [17–19]. We believe a holistic approach is required to understand the
evolution as more often than not the selection advantage being offered by any mutation is a
chance event and can be from any part of the genome.

In terms of the impact of these variable sites on amino acid sequence of the viral proteins we
classified them into four categories. First, the sites located in the extragenic region and hence
no influence on the coding proteins. There were 10 such variable sites localized to the UTR
regions (2 in 3’UTR and 8 in 5’UTR). Secondly, SNP-silent included those variable sites
wherein the nucleotide change was leaving the amino acid sequenced unaltered. A total of
186 such sites were distributed across the genome. Thirdly, the variable sites which were
leading to the introduction of a stop codon were referred to as SNP-stop and there were 8
such sites in our study. Lastly, the variable sites which were affecting the protein sequence
are referred as SNP in the study and there were 281 such sites (Supplementary file 3). The
prevalence and distribution of these sites has been summarized in Figure 1 and results of the
prediction of their impact on protein has been discussed later.

Constitution of genome, variable sites and the substitutions
In order to understand the underlying dynamics of substitutions, we performed the maximum
composite likelihood estimate of nucleotide substitution as shown in Table 3. The reference
and substituted nucleotide have been shown in rows and columns respectively. The values
therein represent the probability of substitution (r) from one base to another. For simplicity,
the sum of r values is made equal to 100. The nucleotide frequencies of the MSA are 29.87%
(A), 32.14% (T/U), 18.37% (C), and 19.63% (G). The transition/transversion rate ratios are
k1 = 2.195 (purines) and k2 = 7.799 (pyrimidines). The overall transition/transversion bias is
R = 2.356, where R = [A*G*k1 + T*C*k2]/[(A+G)*(T+C)]. This substantiates the
prevalence of certain mutations (C→T and G→T) over others.

We thereon looked at these variations in combination with their prevalence across samples.
The most prevalent nucleotide at the variable sites in reference sequence was C (209)
followed by G (137) whereas T was by far the predominantly substituted nucleotide (293,
60%). Also, the other three nucleotides had an almost equal representation in substitutions
(A-68, G-68, T-64). This biased prevalence was not restricted to the alignment but was also
getting translated to population incidence. There was a total of 723 mutations with C as
reference nucleotide and 1032 mutations with T as substituted nucleotide across 611 studied
genomes. The composition of 493 variable sites, their substitutions and prevalence across
samples has been summarized in Figure 2 and Supplementary file 2. Evidently, any particular
mutation may be incident across multiple samples and a single sample can harbor multiple
mutations. A cumulative number for the same has been referred to as “Sum of Mutation
Incidence” herein and thereafter in this study.

Age and Gender wise distribution of samples and mutations therein
We subsequently analyzed the patient’s dataset with reference to age and gender for the
incidence of mutations. However, since patients’ data wasn’t cumulatively available, the data
for this aspect isn’t exhaustive but representative for 255 samples (104 females and 151
males). The patients whose genomes were used in the study and age was known were
classified into seven categories from infancy to over 75 years. The maximum number of
patients for both males and females belonged to mature adulthood category of 50 to 74 years
with 57 and 40 samples respectively (Figure 3, Supplementary file 4). This adheres to the fact
that the older population is at a greater risk for infection owing to a possibly weaker immune
system and other physiological conditions.

The simple question of whether or not age and gender are associated with accumulation of
genome variations has a not so simple answer. The overall average number of mutations per
sample was 2.69 and the corresponding values for males and females separately was 2.56 and
2.88 respectively. Thus, women were contributing more to the mutational accumulation as
compared to males. The individual mutational load for different age groups in males and
females has been represented in Figure 4. Evidently, women are contributing more to the
mutational load except for three age groups; 5-9years, 10-14years and 20-34 years. The
highest difference on the basis of gender is for 15-19 years (2.67) but since there was just one
female sample in that age group, it can’t be emphasized much in isolation but the overall
pattern does seem relevant. This is more so because, in terms of incidence, males are almost
1.5 times of the females but in terms of variations, fewer females are contributing more to the
mutational load. Possibly, the virus is behaving differently depending on gender.

Geographical distribution and accumulation of variable sites
The mutational distribution across different states of India was subsequently ascertained.
Generally speaking, more the virus replicates more should be the accumulated variations. The
fact that the samples used in the study aren’t uniformly distributed across states provides for
an intriguing template for analysis. The number of samples and the mutations therein for
different states has been summarized in Figure 5 and Supplementary file 4. Evidently,
Gujarat with highest number of 199 samples had maximum of 694 mutations. However, the
correlation is neither uniform nor universal. For instance, Maharashtra with 94 samples had
203 variations whereas Telangana with 97 samples had 154 variations. A plausible
explanation for this can be one sequence in Telangana (Genome ID 458080) to be identical to
reference sequence as reported [7]. That means, Maharashtra samples had more variations
from reference sequence to begin with. But if we look and Odisha and Tamil Nadu with 30
and 31 samples accounting for 109 and 40 variations respectively, it’s evident that sequences
in some regions are mutating faster than others. Another contrasting example pair is Delhi
(63 samples, 54 mutations) and West Bengal (40 samples, 70 mutations). The exact
mutational route can be revealed only with tracking the route of samples and spreading of
infection which has not been feasible for present dataset due to paucity of information.
However, we can surely say that some sequences are mutating more than the others but
whether the geographical location is playing a role needs to be ascertained.

Impact of variables sites on viral proteins
A total of 281 SNPs which were present which were altering the amino acid sequence. Their
details and positions have been summarized in Table 4 and Supplementary file 5. We also
ascertained the prevalence of these variants across samples. The most incident variant Q57H
localized to ORF3a was present in 127 samples followed by A994D in NSP3 present in 29

samples. Amongst the silent SNPs, Y71Y in M protein was present in 117 samples followed
by D294D in S protein with 69 incidences. The overall data for variants present in 10
genomes or more has been summarized in Figure 6a. Conversely, we also assessed the
accumulation of variations in a given genome as summarized in Figure 6b. Interestingly, one
sample (Genome ID 461495) had highest incidence of 11 mutations while 114 samples
harbored just a single mutation. There were 156 samples with no mutations and 340 with
more than one mutation. To account for these, the Sum of Mutation Incidence has been used
in this study as explained above.

The impact of mutations on proteins was predicted through three different tools; SIFT,
PROVEAN, ws-SNPs&GO; which classified the mutations as “Neutral/Tolerated” or
“Disease/Affect Protein Function/Deleterious”. For the sake of simplicity, we have referred
the results from all sites as Neutral and Disease. Though the prediction outcomes of the three
tools were not in sync for all sites but since the classification of outcomes were on similar
lines, the results can be represented in a binary manner with four categories. First two
categories represent wherein the three tools have the same prediction; either all predicting a
site to be “Neutral” or “Disease”. The other two categories represent deviation between
prediction outcomes. They are “Disease by One, Neutral by Two” and “Disease by Two and
Neutral by One”. For comparison between variants, any mutation predicted as Disease by
Two or Three tools are considered as Disease and mutations predicted as Neutral by Two or
Three tools are considered as Neutral.

The distribution of Disease and Neutral variants across the different genes of SARS-CoV-2
has been shown in Table 4 and Supplementary file 5. These could be analyzed in three
aspects. First, in terms of overall incidence. The maximum variants affecting protein

sequence were present in NSP3 (63) followed by Spike (S) protein with 49 variants.
Secondly, if we focus only on variants with predicted outcome as “Disease” then NSP13 has
a maximum of 14 such variants followed by S protein and ORF3a with 13 variants each.
Thirdly, we looked at those proteins which had more Disease variants as compared to
Neutral. There were five such proteins namely: NSP5, NSP10, NSP13, ORF3a, E, ORF7a. Of
these NSP10 had just two variants and both of them were predicted as Disease by all three
tools. Others had differential bias towards Disease variants. Thus, we can say that though
some regions of the genome have more variations but mostly Neutral while others with fewer
variations are more impactful in terms of their predicted impact due to more Disease variants.
Conversely, mutations in some proteins can be relatively better tolerated by the viral genome.

The overall protein prediction outcomes of the 611 genomes have been summarized in Figure
7. There were total of 198 mutations (70%) and 83 mutations (30%) which are predicted to be
Neutral and Disease respectively by at least two tools. These predictions suggest that even
though mutations are accumulating in SARS-CoV-2, they are predominantly neutral. This is
the possible reason that no major virulence or physiological deviations have been observed so
far.

Mutational profile of Asymptomatic and deceased samples
In order to further assess impact of these variations we compared their prevalence across
samples which were asymptomatic with those wherein the patient died. The idea was that if
predictions are true, then asymptomatic samples should have more of neutral mutations
whereas deceased ones should have more of disease mutations. The present congregation of
samples in the study had just 2 asymptomatic samples and 15 deceased. Thereon, we included
30 new asymptomatic samples (Supplementary file 1) and compared their amino acid

mutations with those of 15 deceased samples. Their comparative data has been shown in
Table 5. The p value therein represents the probability that a given variant chosen at random
to be Neutral or Disease. Taking the threshold as common prediction by at least two tools the
data gives interesting insights. As shown and previously mentioned, for the original
congregation of 611 samples, 70% mutations were Neutral (p value 0.7) and 30% were
Disease (p value 0.3). The asymptomatic samples with a total of 55 SNPs affecting amino
acid sequence had p value of 0.89 for Neutral variants and 0.11 for Disease variants.
Corresponding data for the deceased samples with a total of 13 mutations affecting amino
acid sequence had p values of 0.61 and 0.39 for Neutral and Disease variants respectively.
Evidently, asymptomatic samples had majorly neutral mutations (89%) but deceased samples
have a reduced share of neutral mutations (61%) and enhanced share of Disease mutations
(39%). The data were analyzed in terms of p value owing to the difference in number of
samples in each category. However, we do agree that a larger data set analysis for all
categories with clinical correlation will provide greater insight into the impact of protein
variations on SARS-CoV-2.

Conclusions
The mutational accumulation in SARS-CoV-2 genomes is a multifactorial event with some
areas of genome more prone to mutations, selective mutations being more prevalent, nonlinear assimilation of mutations across various states and differential correlation between
mutational impact on proteins and physiological state. Age and gender specific bias in
incidence of mutations was observed. The asymptomatic samples had higher occurrence of
Neutral variants while deceased samples had relatively higher incidence of Disease variants.
A cross-linking of mutational dynamics and patient history will provide for better correlation
and understanding of the variations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Figure Legends
Figure 1: Summary of variations observed in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India. The
nature of variations (Singleton/PI); type of mutation, genome localization and impact on
protein (SNP, SNP-Silent, SNP-Stop, Extragenic) has been represented along with their
interlinking. The width of the connecting lines represent number; broader the line more the
number of that parameter.
Figure 2: Prevalence and composition of different nucleotides across reference and
substituted positions in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India.
Figure 3: Age and gender wise distribution of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from
India. Number of male/female samples and sum of mutations incidence therein according to
age group.
Figure 4: Average number of mutations per sample in different age groups of
males/females and the differences therein.
Figure 5: Number of samples and corresponding Sum of Mutation Incidence of SARSCoV-2 across different states of India.
Figure 6: Prevalence of variant sites across studied genomes. a) Most prevalent SNP and
SNP_Silent across studied samples. Variants which had incidence across more than ten
genomes haven been represented. b) Samples with accumulated variations in genomes
