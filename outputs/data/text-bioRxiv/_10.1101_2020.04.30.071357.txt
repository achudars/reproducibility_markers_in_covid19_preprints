Abstract.

18

The recent emerging coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been rapidly and widely spread and

19

causing an ongoing viral pneumonia outbreak worldwide. It has been observed that SARS-

20

CoV-2 patients show a rather long and asymptomatic incubation time. We characterized the

21

abilities to induce and to response to IFNβ/IFNλ1 of two or our clinical isolates, SARS-CoV-

22

2/NTU01/TWN/human/2020 and SARS-CoV-2/NTU02/TWN/human/2020, which exhibit

23

only two amino acid differences over the ~30kb viral genome. We found that both isolates

24

may infect Huh7, A549 and Calu-3 cells, yet the RIG-I-like receptor-dependent antiviral

25

signaling was poorly induced in these cells in the early infections. Unexpectedly, we found

26

that the intracellular vRNA levels of these isolates were sustained upon to type I/III IFN

27

treatments, and this phenotype was more pronounced in the Taiwan/NTU01/2020 isolate. The

28

type I/III IFN responses are antiviral but partially proviral in the case of SARS-CoV-2

29

infections. Poor induction and response to innate immunity may contribute to destitute

30

neutralization index of the antibody produced, and indeed we found that the patient serum

31

could not efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virions. With better understandings of the

32

interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the host antiviral innate immunity, our report may

33

provide new insights for the regimen of therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

Main

35

In December 2019, a few pneumonia patients with low respiratory infections were

36

identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China1. The etiology of this illness was then termed as

37

coronavirus infection disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was caused by severe acute

38

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 shares about 80%

39

nucleotide identity to the original SARS-CoV, and the corresponding disease, COVID-19,

40

shows many similar symptoms to the original SARS-CoV infection2. Both SARS-CoV and

41

SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from human to human, and both utilize human angiotensin

42

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the major receptor for virus entry3-5. However, the

43

transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between human seems more efficiently than that of the original

44

SARS-CoV. In April 2020, more than 2,000,000 cases of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients

45

have been reported in more than 185 countries around the world.

46

The induction and expression of type I and type III interferons (IFNs) are the frontlines to

47

fight against viral infections6,7. These responses occur within minutes to hours post-infection

48

and rapidly set the infected and the neighboring cells in the anti-viral state by inducing the

49

expression of interferon and antiviral immunity by recruiting innate and adaptive immune

50

cells from hours to days post-infection. Upon virus infection and pathogen-associated

51

molecular pattern (PAMP) recognition, the PAMP recognition receptors (PRRs) are then lead

52

to the activation of PAMP-driven transcription factor, IFN production and interferon-

53

stimulated gene (ISG) expression resulting in the immediate expression of host response

54

genes8. An early onset of type I IFN induction and response is the key for successful viral

55

clearance7. Particularly, type III IFN plays a critical role at the barrier surfaces, such as the

56

airway and the GI tract9. It has been shown that IFNλ1 was more potent than type I IFN in

57

restricting viral propagation with less inflammation and tissue damage

58

many viruses have evolved some strategies to escape from the induction of response to type

59

I/III IFN to establish the infection 12,13.

60

Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals has been reported in many studies 14.

61

Some SARS-CoV-2 infected patients showed long incubation time before the symptoms were

62

developed. Two SARS-CoV-2-infected patients admitted to our unit showed distinct clinical

63

virology and serology progresses (Table 1). Both patients showed normal complete blood

64

count (CBC) initially with mild thrombocytopenia. Although days taken for seroconversion

65

highly varied between the two patients, the immunoglobulin levels including total IgM, IgG

66

and IgA were comparable (Table 1). While Patient NTU2 showed early seroconversion and

67

rapid viral clearance, Patient NTU1 showed a slightly delayed seroconversion and a

68

prolonged virus shedding period post seroconversion, up to 63 days post symptom onset

69

(Table 1)

70

sufficiently induced in time to confront SARS-CoV-2 infections in Patient NTU1. We then

71

isolated viruses from both patients, SARS-CoV-2/NTU01/TWN/human/2020 (GeneBank:

72

MT066175.1) and SARS-CoV-2/NTU02/TWN/human/2020 (GeneBank: MT066176.1), and

73

assessed how these isolates may induce and response to host innate immunity in cell cultures.

74

We then performed many assays in cell culture, where only the innate immunity of the

75

infected host cells are involved, to rule out the variations among infected individuals and to

76

characterize the virology of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. RNA sequencing results determined that

77

SARS-CoV-2/NTU01/TWN/human/2020 represented clade B with the L84S (28144T>C)

78

polymorphism in ORF8, and SARS-CoV-2/NTU02/TWN/human/2020 was highly related to

79

the Wuhan prototype strain (Table 2). We hypothesize that the induction levels of type I and

80

type III IFNs may be low during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this may be due to the lack of

81

PRR recognition and/or a strong suppression of type I/III IFN expressions by the viral

82

proteins of SARS-CoV-2. To address these questions, we utilized two of our clinical isolates

15

. Therefore, it is likely that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 innate immunity was not

83

of SARS-CoV-2 to infect Huh7, A549, and Calu3 cells, and monitored their inductions and

84

responses to type I/III interferons during SARS-CoV-2 infections.

85

We first monitored the intracellular vRNA levels of SARS-CoV-2 in Huh7 hepatoma cells,

86

of which cell-line that was widely used for previous SARS-CoV studies. Huh7 and MAVS

87

K/D Huh7 cells were infected with either SARS-CoV-2/NTU01/TWN/human/2020 (NTU1)

88

or SARS-CoV-2/NTU02/TWN/human/2020 (NTU2) at the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.)

89

of 0.01-0.1 for two days. By 48 hours post infection (h.p.i.), we did not observe any

90

cytopathogenic effects (CPE) in Huh7 nor in the MAVS K/D huh7 cells (Supplementary Fig.

91

1A). The total intracellular vRNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA, and the levels were

92

determined by Taqman qPCR. As expected, the detected intracellular SARS-CoV2 vRNA

93

levels increased along with the initial m.o.i. used for infection in both NTU1- and NTU2-

94

infected Huh7 cells (Fig 1A). For both isolates, the vRNA levels was higher at 24 h.p.i than

95

those at 48 h.p.i, suggesting that the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Huh7 is none or very

96

minimal (Fig. 1A). Also, NTU1 and NTU2 showed comparable intracellular vRNA levels in

97

the infected Huh7 cells (Fig. 1A). Compared to the wildtype Huh7 cells, we did not observe

98

any significant differences at the intracellular vRNA levels in the SARS-CoV-2 infected

99

MAVS K/D huh7 cells (Fig. 1B). The loss of MAVS-dependent antiviral innate immunity did

100

not further support replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Huh7 cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the

101

RIG-I-like receptors-dependent antiviral innate signaling, primarily the induction of type I

102

and type III IFNs, may only have marginal anti-viral effects on the replication of SARS-CoV-

103

2. As an infection control of RNA viruses, Sendai virus (SenV), which belongs to the

104

paramyxoviridae, was utilized. We then compared the induction levels of IFNβ and IFNλ1 in

105

SARS-CoV-2-infected and SenV-infected Huh7 cells. After SenV-infection, Huh7 cells

106

generated decent antiviral innate immunity against SenV as the mRNA levels of IFNβ, IFNλ1,

107

and IFIT were all elevated (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Besides, the mRNA levels of IFITM3,

108

which is specifically controlled by the interferon-sensitive response element (ISRE)

109

downstream of type I IFN receptors, was also elevated, suggesting that Huh7 cells have the

110

intact inductions and responses to type I IFN during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Supplementary

111

Fig. 1B). However, in Huh7 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 0.01 m.o.i., we found that

112

IFNβ mRNA levels were only transiently induced with a very low fold of induction at 24

113

h.p.i and were down to background levels at 48 h.p.i in the infected Huh7 cells, which is

114

correlating to the vRNA levels detected in these cells (Fig. 1, A & C). We did not observe

115

any significant induction of IFNβ in Huh7 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 0.1 m.o.i. (Fig.

116

1C).

117

A recent study has reported that the virus-like particle of SARS-CoV-2 could enter Huh7,

118

A549, Calu-3, and many other cell lines 3. We then repeated above experiments in relevant

119

airway cell-lines, A549 and Calu-3 cells, which are adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal

120

epithelial cells and human lung cancer epithelial cell, respectively. In consistent with data

121

collected from Huh7 cells, both isolates were able to infect A549 and Calu-3 cells (Fig. 2, A

122

& B). Similarly, the vRNA levels in A549 was higher at 24 h.p.i than those at 48 h.p.i (Fig.

123

2A), which is consistent to the phenotype observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected Huh7 cells,

124

suggesting that A549 cells could not efficiently support SARS-CoV-2 replication either.

125

Strikingly, Calu-3 cells were capable to highly efficiently support SARS-CoV-2 replication

126

as shown by the increased intracellular vRNA levels over time from 24 to 48 h.p.i. with

127

SARS-CoV-2 infection at 0.01 m.o.i (Fig. 2B). The vRNA levels in 0.1 m.o.i. SARS-CoV-2

128

infected Calu-3 cells were not examined due to the great loss of cells from cell death after 48

129

hours (data not shown). Among the three cell-lines that we infected with the same m.o.i, the

130

intracellular vRNA levels in Calu-3 was 10,000-fold higher than those in the Huh7 and A549

131

cells (Figs. 1A & 2A-B), and Calu-3 is the only human cell-line we tested that showed a CPE

132

after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 2C).

133

Besides SARS-CoV-2 replication, the induction of type I/III IFNs in SARS-CoV-2

134

infected Calu-3 cells, which supports SARS-CoV-2 replication most efficiently among the

135

cells we tested, were also assessed (Fig. 2D). To confirm that Calu-3 has intact type I/III IFN

136

inductions and responses against RNA virus infections, we first infected Calu-3 cells with

137

100 HAU/ml SenV for 24-48 hours and examined the intracellular vRNA levels and the

138

mRNA levels of ISGs (Supplementary Fig. 2A). As expected, SenV vRNA levels increased

139

over time from 24 to 48 h.p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 2A), and the mRNA levels of IFNβ,

140

IFNλ1, IFIT1, and IFITM3 were also increased, suggesting the SenV-infected Calu-3 was

141

able to turn on the antiviral signaling against SenV infection. Conversely, although the

142

intracellular levels of SARS-CoV-2 vRNA were readily amplified at 24 h.p.i, the induction of

143

IFNβ and IFNλ1 mRNA expressions in Calu-3 remained undetectable at 24 h.p.i (Fig. 2, B &

144

D), indicating either that the intracellular vRNAs of SARS-CoV-2 are poor ligands for RNA

145

recognition by the PRRs to induce type I/III IFNs or certain viral products of SARS-CoV2

146

could strongly suppress the induction of antiviral innate immunity. This phenotype is very

147

different from how Calu-3 response to SenV infection (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. 2A).

148

During SenV infection, the fold induction of IFNβ and IFNλ1 mRNA was correlated to the

149

vRNA levels of SenV (Supplementary Fig. 2A). Nevertheless, during SARS-CoV-2 infection,

150

the attitude of the induction of IFNβ and IFNλ1 mRNA expression was not correlated to the

151

intracellular vRNA levels. The initial induction of IFNβ and IFNλ1 mRNA expression was

152

weak at 24 h.p.i during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 2, D and E) At 48 hours post SARS-

153

CoV-2 infection, along with the elevated amount of intracellular vRNA (Fig. 2B), both the

154

mRNA levels of IFNβ and IFNλ1 in SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 were drastically increased,

155

and the expressions of ISGs, including IFIT and IFITM3 were also elevated (Fig. 2D). As

156

previously mentioned that the expression of IFITM3 is under the control of ISRE, these

157

results suggested that in Calu-3 cells, the production of type I/III IFNs was not impaired

158

during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 2D). We next determined whether the induction of type I

159

and type III IFNs were dependent on the TBK1-IRF3 axis of signaling. Calu-3 cells were

160

infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 6 hours and then treated with a TBK1 inhibitor, BX795, for

161

18 hours. The IFNβ and IFNλ1 mRNA were induced at low levels after 24 hours SARS-CoV-

162

2 infection in the mock-treated Calu-3 cells, and this induction was diminished in the BX-795

163

pre-treated SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells (Fig. 2E), indicating the critical roles of

164

TBK1-IRF3 in SARS-CoV-2-induced type I/III IFN induction. These data suggested that

165

SARS-CoV-2 vRNA was only able to induce antiviral innate immunity in cells which well-

166

supported SARS-CoV-2 replication, and that SARS-CoV-2 is likely a weak inducer and also

167

a strong suppressor of type I/III IFNs.

168

Our results indicate that the viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was able to be detected by

169

intracellular PRRs to induce type I/III IFN expression. Although the induction of IFNβ and

170

IFNλ1 was transiently detected in SARS-CoV-2 infected Huh7 cells, the mRNA levels of

171

several ISGs, including IFIT1 and IFMTF3 were not increased during infection (Fig. 3A). We

172

then assessed whether the intracellular vRNA of SARS-CoV-2 could serve as the ligands of

173

the cytoplasmic foreign RNA receptors, RIG-I and MDA5. Total RNA extracted from the

174

NTU-1- or NTU-2- infected Calu-3 cells were transfected into mouse embryonic fibroblasts

175

(MEFs) treated with cycloheximide to monitor their abilities to induce type I IFN expression

176

by measuring the mRNA levels of Ifnb in the absence of any newly-translated proteins (Fig.

177

3B). As negative and positive controls, total Calu-3 intracellular from mock-infected

178

(mcRNA) or Sendai virus-infected (SenV-icRNA) cells were also transfected into MEFs

179

respectively (Fig. 3B). The transfection of mcRNA into MEFs did not induce any expression

180

of Ifnb in MEFs. The Ifnb mRNA levels were greatly increased in MEFs transfected with

181

total intracellular RNA harvested from SenV-infected cells (Fig. 3B). We then pretreated the

182

SenV-icRNA samples with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase prior to transfection to reduce

183

RIG-I recognition of SenV-icRNA, and as expected, the Ifnb mRNA levels induced by CIP-

184

treated SenV-icRNA transfection was drastically reduced (Fig. 3B). We found that MEFs

185

transfected with the total RNAs extracted from SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells (NTU1-

186

and NTU2-icRNAs) were able to induce slight expression of Ifnb mRNA when compared to

187

that transfected with SenV-icRNA (Fig. 3B), and the phosphatase pretreatment of the total

188

RNA extracted from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells prior to RNA transfection could barely

189

reduce the induction of Ifnb mRNA, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be

190

recognized mostly through PRRs other than RIG-I (Fig. 3B).

191

Based on these results, it is suggested that although the replication intermediates of

192

SARS-CoV-2 is an inducer for type I IFN expression, SARS-CoV-2 may encode some viral

193

products as strong type I IFN induction suppressors, which together contribute the poor

194

induction of type I/III IFNs (Figs. 2D and 3B). Therefore, we next assessed whether the

195

complementarity by exogenous source of type I or type III IFNs in the culture medium may

196

facilitate the cells to establish the antiviral states to restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication. Huh7

197

and Calu-3 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 isolates at the indicated m.o.i. for 24 hours

198

and then treated with either 100 IU/mL of IFNβ or 100 ng/ mL of IFNλ1 for 24 hours. The

199

intracellular RNA from these cells were then extracted by trizol and reverse-transcribed into

200

cDNA for quantitative PCR. The mRNA levels of several ISGs, including IFIT1 and IFITM3,

201

were first determined to validate that the treatment of IFNβ and/or IFNλ1 indeed turned on

202

the expression of ISGs (Fig. 3C). The expression levels of ISGs post-interferon treatments

203

were at comparable levels among the mock-, NTU1-, and NTU2-infected cells, suggesting

204

that SARS-CoV-2 infection did not block the response to type I IFN in Huh7 cells (Fig. 3C).

205

In Calu-3 cells, SARS-CoV-2 infection may induce the expression of type I/III expression at

206

48 h.p.i. (Fig. 2D), and responses to both type I and type III IFN post-treatments during

207

SARS-CoV-2 further elevated the mRNA expression levels of IFIT1 and IFITM3 (Fig. 3D).

208

Typically, the expression of ISGs in response to the treatment of type I/III IFNs facilitate the

209

cells to be antiviral as we have shown that either pre- or post-treated the cells with type I/III

210

IFN during SenV infection, the cells were able to restrict SenV replication (Supplementary

211

Fig. 2, A & B). Calu-3 cells pretreated with type I and/or type III IFNs were also able to

212

restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication (Supplementary Fig. 3A). However, in all cells which were

213

post-treated with either type I and/or type III IFNs after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we did not

214

observe any antiviral effects in these cells as the vRNA levels sustained after the treatment of

215

type I/III IFNs (Fig. 3E). The vRNA levels of NTU2 remained unchanged upon type I IFN

216

treatment in Huh7 and A549 cells (Fig. 3E), but however, the vRNA levels of NTU1 were

217

predominantly enhanced after the treatment of type I IFN (Fig. 3E). In Calu-3 cells, which

218

highly supports SARS-CoV-2 replication, the vRNA levels of NTU1 were not reduced upon

219

post-treatment of type I/III IFNs while the vRNA levels of NTU2 were slightly suppressed by

220

type I/III IFN treatments (Fig. 3F). In contrast, the post-treatment of BX795, which inhibits

221

the expression of type I/III IFN (Fig. 3G), was able to increase the vRNA levels of NTU2 in

222

Calu-3 cells, of which viral infection is more sensitive the type I/III IFN post-treatment (Fig.

223

3F). All these data indicated that pre-treatment of type I/III IFNs potentiates the cells to

224

restrict SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is consistent to a recent report in SARS-CoV-2

225

infected Vero-E6 cells

226

post-treatment of type I and/or type III IFNs could not effectively control SARS-CoV-2

227

replication. A recent report revealed the viral protein interactome of SARS-CoV-2 and

228

showed that SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 was capable to interact with TBK1, which is a critical

229

kinase to activation IRF3 for type I/III IFN expressions 17. The detail mechanism remained to

230

be further studied.

It has been shown that deficiency in RLR-dependent antiviral signaling, such as the

induction of type I IFN, may result in uncontrolled inflammation and adaptive immunity

233

which could not provide protection against the viral infection18. The induction of type I IFN

234

in the epithelial cells correlates to the neutralization index of antibodies produced during viral

235

infection18. Our cell culture experiments showed that the inductions of type I/III IFN

236

expressions were poor during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and therefore we next assessed

237

whether the serum from SARS-CoV-2-infected patient may provide good quantity and

238

quality of antibodies to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virion. A recent study showed that among

239

the hospitalized COVID19 patients, the occurrence of seroconversion was not followed by a

240

rapid decline of the viral titer 19. For NTU1 patient, gradual viral load decrease was observed

241

since hospitalization and the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 was first identified on the

242

tenth day 15. The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) was performed to determine the

243

neutralizing activities of serum collected from NTU2 patient post seroconversion and that

244

from NTU1 patient on the 1st and the 18th day of hospitalization, which represented serum

245

before and after seroconversion respectively15. The serum from NTU2 patient, who rapid

246

clear SARS-CoV-2 after seroconversion (Table 1), was able to effectively neutralize NTU1

247

virions at >1:160 dilution in the PRNT assay (Supplementary Fig. 4). However, both serum

248

collected from Patient NTU1 before and after seroconversion did not well-neutralize the

249

virion isolated from the same patient (NTU1) The PRNT50 for NTU1 is about 1:80 before

250

seroconversion and 1:160 after seroconversion (Fig. 4). These results together indicated that

251

although the total IgM, IgG, and IgA amount between both patients were at the comparable

252

of SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterizations of how SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the cell as

259

well as how it may escape from the frontline of host antiviral innate immunity are critical for

260

the development of therapy in responding to the novel infectious agents. During the

261

preparation of this manuscript, several studies also reported that unlike SARS-CoV and/or

262

Influenza A Virus infection, SARS-CoV-2 infection showed a delayed or suppressed

263

phenotypes in the inductions of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokines in several models

264

20,21

265

We have tested several cell types and found that Calu-3, which supported SARS-CoV-2

266

replication with a CPE post-infection, may be a decent model to study this emerging virus

267

instead of utilizing Huh7 and/or A549. Information obtained from SARS-CoV-2 infected

268

Calu-3 cells will be relevant to the real infection situations. Our data suggested that although

269

the vRNA and/or RNA replication intermediates could be recognized by host PRRs to induce

270

type I/III IFN expressions, the virus likely encodes certain viral product to antagonize the

271

antiviral innate immunity at the early stage of the infection. In some of our cull culture

272

experiments, the treatment of type I or type III IFNs unexpectedly enhanced intracellular

273

vRNA levels (Fig 3, E-F). Intriguingly, a recent report showed that among the top 50 genes

274

which were co-expressed with ACE2, an entry receptor for SARS-CoV2, many of them were

275

ISGs or genes that are involved in the regulation innate immunity, including ASS1, OAS1,

276

MX1, and etc.22. In our study, we found that pretreatment of TBK1 inhibitor prior go SARS-

277

CoV-2 infection, however, unexpectedly reduced the intracellular vRNA at 24 h.p.i., of

278

which phenomenon also observed in the SARS-CoV-2-infected MAVS K/D Huh7 cells

279

(Supplementary Fig. 3B and Fig. 1B). We examined the mRNA levels of ACE2 in our

280

samples and found that the expression of ACE2 was increased after of IFNβ and/or IFNλ1

281

treatment and was decreased in cells treated with BX-795 or knocked-down with MAVS

282

(Supplementary Fig. 3), which may be correlating with the reduced vRNA levels we

. However, in these experimental models, SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication was not ideal.

283

observed in the MAVS K/D and BX795-treated cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection. A recent

284

report showed that ACE2 may be an ISG in human epithelial cells 23. Our study together with

285

recent reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may utilize certain ISGs to benefit its own life cycle.

286

This may also explain why patients with chronic inflammation disease are more prone to

287

COVID19. Whether the response to type I/III interferon treatments were purely anti-SARS-

288

CoV-2 remained debatable.

289

The two isolates in this study, SARS-CoV-2/NTU01/TWN/human/2020 (NTU1) and

290

SARS-CoV-2/NTU02/TWN/human/2020 (NTU2), presents similar replication preferences

291

among the cell-lines we tested. The replication kinetics of these 2 isolates were similar, but

292

however, their responses to the post-treatment of type I/III IFNs were different. While NTU2

293

was rather sensitive to the post-treatment of type I/III IFNs in the Calu-3 cells, NTU1 seemed

294

to be resistant to the treatment of type I/III IFNs. The genetic difference of these 2 isolates

295

were quite little. At the genetic level, there were positions 8782, 9034, 9491, and 28144 four

296

nucleotides different. In the viral protein sequence, only two amino acid sites of orf1ab and

297

orf8 were different (Table 2). Tang’s group found genetic analysis of 103 SARS-CoV-2

298

genomes by SNP could define the L and S lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in two linked SNPs at

299

sites 8782 and 288144

300

SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. We tried to subclone and express ORF8 from both isolates in

301

either mammalian cells or in E. coli, and none of the system could support decent expression

302

of ORF8 (data not shown). Therefore, at this point, we are not able to design any molecular

303

biological studies to elucidate whether the genotypic difference in ORF8 between the two

304

isolates might contribute to the phenotypic differences in the response to type I/III IFNs.

. However, the virulence or pathogenicity of these two lineages of

Lastly, we found that seroconversion in patients did not correlate with their abilities for

306

viral clearance. As reviewed a recent perspective, How the responses to type I/III IFNs in

307

patients and/or healthy individual who received the vaccine may likely affect the

protectivities provided by the antibodies25. Better assays to determine whether the antibodies

309

developed during seroconversions are protective or pathogenic remained to be established.

This will be rather useful to determine the regiment for each COVID19 patients as well as to

311

evaluate the vaccine protectivity in the future.

Material and Method
Cells and Viruses
Huh7, A549, Calu-3, VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells were propagated in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium DMEM; Gibco-BRL, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; GIBCO-BRL, USA), penicillin G sodium 100 units/mL, streptomycin sulfate 100
μg/mL and amphotericin B 250 ng/mL (antibiotic-antimycotic; Gibco-BRL, USA). Stable
MAVS knock-down (MAVS K/D) Huh7 cells as previously described26 was cultured in
DMEM with 10% FBS and 1μg/mL of puromycin. Throat-swab, sputum, and/or
nasopharyngeal swab specimens obtained from SARS-CoV-2-infected patient were
maintained in viral-transport medium. The specimens were propagated in VeroE6 cells and/or
LLC-MK2 cells in DMEM supplemented with 2 μg/mL of tosylsulfonyl phenylalantyl
chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) -trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). Culture supernatants were harvested
when more than 70% of cells showing cytopathic effects, and the virus titers were determined
by plaque assay. Experiments involving infectious SARS-CoV-2 followed the approved
standard operating procedures of our Biosafety Level 3 facility at the College of Medicine,
National Taiwan University.
Virus infection
Virus infection was performed in 24-well tissue culture plates. The VeroE6 cells were seeded
at 2 x 105 cells/well in DMEM with 10% FCS and antibiotics one day before infection.
SARS-CoV-2 at indicated MOI were added to the cell monolayer for 1 hour at 37°C.
Subsequently, viruses were removed and the cell monolayer was washed once with PBS
before covering with media containing 2% FCS. At the end of infection, the virus titers in the
supernatants were determined by RT-qPCR (or plaque assay).

RNA extraction and Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR
Total RNA from infected cells was extracted with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies) by
isopropanol precipitations, and cDNA was prepared with iScript (BioRad). Quantitative PCR
of vRNA was performed with TaqMan probes detecting SARS-CoV-2 N gene (IDT,
#10006600). RP was used as a reference gene. Quantitative PCR of IFN-beta, IFN-lambda,
IFIT1, and IFITM3 were performed with Power SYBR Green PCR (Life Technologies). Data
were analyzed according to the ΔCT method. Primer and probe sequences are listed in
Supplementary Table 1.
RNA transfection
RNA transfection assay was described exhaustively in previous study27. Briefly, total RNA
from calu-3 cells infected with SeV, SARS-CoV-2/NTU1 or SARS-CoV-2/NTU2 and
uninfected cells were extracted with Trizol. All RNA samples were treated with or without

Plaque reduction neutralization assay
Plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT) assay was performed to determine the SARS-CoV-2
titers as previously described with minor modification 28. Briefly, the VeroE6 cells were
seeded at 2 x 105 cells/well in the 24-well tissue culture plates with DMEM containing 10%
FCS and antibiotics one day before infection. Serial diluted serum was preinteracted with
SARS-CoV-2 at 37°C for one hour and then added to the cell monolayer for 1 hour at 37°C.
Subsequently, viruses were removed, and the cell monolayer was washed once with PBS
before covering with media containing 1% methylcellulose for 5-7 days. The cells were fixed
with 10% formaldehyde overnight. After removal of overlay media, the cells were stained
with 0.7% crystal violet and the plaques were counted.
Statistic analysis
All data were presented the means ± standard deviation (SD) from two independent
experiments, and the two-tailed Student's t-test was used as statistical analysis, *p<0.05,
**p<0.01.
Ethical approval statement
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board of
the NTUH Research Ethics Committee (202002002RIND) and informed consent was waived.
