Abstract

17

The emergence of the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China has

18

caused a worldwide epidemic of respiratory disease (COVID-19). Vaccines and

19

targeted therapeutics for treatment of this disease are currently lacking. Here we report

20

a human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 (and SARS-CoV). This

21

cross-neutralizing antibody targets a communal epitope on these viruses and offers

22

potential for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

Main text

25

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological

26

agent of the coronavirus induced disease 19 (COVID-19) that emerged in China late

27

2019 and causing a worldwide epidemic1. As of March 10th 2020, over 115,113 cases

28

have been reported in 109 countries, of which 4,063 (3.5%) succumbed to the

29

infection2.

30

Betacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae)3 together with SARS-CoV that emerged in

31

2002 causing approximately 8000 infections with a lethality of 10%. Both viruses

32

crossed species barriers from an animal reservoir and can cause a life-threatening

33

respiratory illness in humans. Presently no approved targeted therapeutics are

34

available for COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies targeting vulnerable sites on viral

35

surface proteins are increasingly recognised as a promising class of drugs against

36

infectious diseases and have shown therapeutic efficacy for a number of viruses4, 5.

37

Coronavirus neutralizing antibodies primarily target the trimeric spike (S) glycoproteins

38

on the viral surface that mediate entry into host cells. The S protein has two functional

39

subunits that mediate cell attachment (the S1 subunit, existing of four core domains

40

S1A through S1D) and fusion of the viral and cellular membrane (the S2 subunit). Potent

41

neutralizing antibodies often target the receptor interaction site in S1, disabling

42

receptor interactions6-11. The spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2-S; 1,273

43

residues, strain Wuhan-Hu-1) and SARS-CoV (SARS-S, 1,255 residues, strain Urbani)

44

are 77.5% identical by primary amino acid sequence, are structurally very similar12, 13

45

and commonly bind the human angiotensin coverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein as a

46

host receptor1, 14 through their S1B domain. Receptor interaction is known to trigger

irreversible conformational changes in coronavirus spike proteins enabling membrane

48

fusion15.

49

In order to identify SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, ELISA-(cross)reactivity was

50

assessed of antibody-containing supernatants of a collection of 51 SARS-S

51

hybridoma’s derived from immunized transgenic H2L2 mice that encode chimeric

52

immunoglobulins with human variable heavy and light chains and constant regions of

53

rat origin (Suppl.Fig.1). Four of 51 SARS-S hybridoma supernatants displayed ELISA-

54

cross-reactivity with the SARS2-S1 subunit (S residues 1-681; Suppl.Fig.1), of which

55

one (47D11) exhibited cross-neutralizing activity of SARS-S and SARS2-S

56

pseudotyped VSV infection. The chimeric 47D11 H2L2 antibody was reformatted and

57

recombinantly expressed as a fully human IgG1 isotype antibody for further

58

characterization.

59

The human 47D11 antibody binds to cells expressing the full-length spike proteins of

60

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.1a). The 47D11 antibody was found to potently

61

inhibit infection of VeroE6 cells with SARS-S and SARS2-S pseudotyped VSV with

62

IC50 values of 0.06 and 0.08 μg/ml (Fig.1b), respectively. Authentic infection of VeroE6

63

cells with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 was neutralized with IC50 values of 0.19 and

64

0.57 μg/ml (Fig.1c). Using ELISA 47D11 was shown to target the S1B receptor binding

65

domain (RBD) of SARS-S and SARS2-S. 47D11 bound the S1B of both viruses with

66

similar affinities as shown by the ELISA-based half maximal effective concentration

67

(EC50) values (0.02 and 0.03 μg/ml, respectively; Fig.2a). ELISA-based binding affinity

68

of 47D11 for the spike ectodomain (Secto) of SARS-CoV was higher relative to that of

69

SARS-CoV-2 (EC50 values: 0.018 and 0.15 μg/ml, respectively), despite equimolar

70

antigen coating (Suppl.Fig.2). Congruent with the ELISA-reactivities, measurement of

71

binding kinetics of 47D11 by biolayer interferometry showed that 47D11 binds SARS-

72

Secto with higher affinity (equilibrium dissociation constant [KD]: 0.745 nM) relative to

73

SARS2-Secto (KD 10.8 nM) whereas affinity for SARS-S1B and SARS2-S1B was in a

74

similar range (16.1 and 9.6 nM, respectively, Suppl.Fig.3). This difference may

75

originate from differences in epitope accessibility in SARS-S versus SARS2-S, as

76

domain B can adopt a closed and open conformation in the prefusion spike

77

homotrimer12, 13. Remarkably, binding of 47D11 to SARS-S1B and SARS2-S1B did not

78

compete with S1B binding to the ACE2 receptor expressed at the cell surface as shown

79

by flow cytometry (Fig.2b; Suppl.Fig.4) nor with Secto and S1B binding to soluble ACE2

80

in solid-phase based assay (Suppl.Fig.5), whereas two SARS-S1 specific antibodies

81

35F4 and 43C6 that neutralize SARS-S (but not SARS2-S) pseudotyped VSV infection

82

(Suppl.Fig.6) do block binding of SARS-Secto and SARS-S1B to ACE2. Using a trypsin-

83

triggered cell-cell fusion assay, 47D11 was shown to impair SARS-S and SARS2-S

84

mediated syncytia formation (Suppl.Fig.7). Our data show that 47D11 neutralizes

85

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through a yet unknown mechanism that is different from

86

receptor binding interference. Alternative mechanisms of coronavirus neutralization by

87

RBD-targeting antibodies have been reported including spike inactivation through

88

antibody-induced destabilization of its prefusion structure15, which may also apply for

89

47D11.

90

The SARS2-S1B receptor binding domain (residues 338-506) consists of a core

91

domain and a receptor binding subdomain (residues 438-498) looping out from the

92

antiparallel betasheet core domain structure that directly engages the receptor.

93

Compared to the S1B core domain, the protein sequence identity of the S1B receptor

94

interacting subdomain of SARS-S and SARS2-S is substantially lower (46.7% versus

95

86.3%; Suppl.Fig.8 and Fig.2c). Potent neutralizing antibodies often target this

96

receptor binding subdomain. However, due to common variations in this subdomain,

97

these antibodies are often virus-specific and bind and neutralize related viruses

98

poorly16, 17. The cross-reactive nature of 47D11 indicates that the antibody is more

99

likely to target the conserved core structure of the S1B receptor binding domain. S1B

100

binding by 47D11 further away from the receptor binding interface explains its inability

101

to compromise spike-receptor interaction.

102

In conclusion, this is the first report on a (human) monoclonal antibody that

103

neutralizes SARS-CoV-2. 47D11 binds a conserved epitope on the spike receptor

104

binding domain explaining its ability to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,

105

using a mechanism that is independent of receptor binding inhibition. This antibody will

106

be useful for development of antigen detection tests and serological assays targeting

107

SARS-CoV-2. Neutralizing antibodies can alter the course of infection in the infected

108

host supporting virus clearance or protect an uninfected host that is exposed to the

109

virus4. Hence, this antibody offers the potential to prevent and/or treat COVID-19, and

110

possibly also other future emerging diseases in humans caused by viruses from the

111

Sarbecovirus subgenus.

Immunofluorescence microscopy. Antibody binding to cell surface spike proteins of

262

SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV was measured by immunofluoresence

263

microscopy. HEK-293T cells seeded on glass slides were transfected with plasmids

264

encoding SARS-S, SARS2-S or MERS-S - C-terminally fused to the green

265

fluorescence protein (GFP) - using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Two days post

266

transfection, cells were fixed by incubation with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20

267

min at room temperature and stained for nuclei with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole

268

(DAPI). Cells were subsequently incubated with mAbs at a concentration of 10 µg/ml

269

for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated

270

goat anti-human IgG antibodies (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 45 min at

271

room temperature. The fluorescence images were recorded using a Leica SpeII

272

confocal microscope.

273

Flow cytometry-based receptor binding inhibition assay. Antibody interference of

274

S1B binding to human ACE2 receptor on the cell surface was measured by flow

275

cytometry. HEK-293T cells were seeded at a density of 2.5×105 cells per ml in a T75

276

flask. After reaching 70~80% confluency, cells were transfected with an expression

277

plasmid encoding human ACE2 - C-terminally fused to the GFP - using Lipofectamine

278

2000 (Invitrogen). Two days post transfection, cells were dissociated by cell

279

dissociation solution (Sigma-aldrich, Merck KGaA; cat. no. C5914). 2.5 µg/ml of human

280

Fc tagged SARS-S1B and SARS2-S1B was preincubated with mAb at the indicated

281

mAb:S1B molar ratios for 1 hour on ice and subjected to flow cytometry. Single cell

282

suspensions in FACS buffer were centrifuged at 400×g for 10 min. Cells were

283

subsequently incubated with S1B and mAb mixture for 1 h on ice, followed by

284

incubation with Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibodies

293

G pseudotyped VSV∆G bearing the firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase reporter gene.

294

Twenty-four hours later, supernatants containing SARS-S/SARS2-S pseudotyped

295

VSV particles were harvested and titrated on African green monkey kidney VeroE6

296

cells. In the virus neutralization assay, mAbs were serially diluted at two times the

297

desired final concentration in DMEM supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum (Bodinco),

298

100 U/ml Penicillin and 100 µg/ml Streptomycin. Diluted mAbs were incubated with an

299

equal volume of pseudotyped VSV particles for 1 hour at room temperature, inoculated

300

on confluent VeroE6 monolayers in 96-well plated, and further incubated at 37°C for

301

24 hours. Luciferase activity was measured on a Berthold Centro LB 960 plate

302

luminometer using D-luciferin as a substrate (Promega). The percentage of infectivity

303

was calculated as ratio of luciferase readout in the presence of mAbs normalized to

304

luciferase readout in the absence of mAb. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations

305

(IC50) were determined using 4-parameter logistic regression (GraphPad Prism version

307

Virus neutralization assay. Neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

308

was performed using a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) as described

309

earlier, with some modifications20. In brief, mAbs were two-fold serially diluted and

310

mixed with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour. The mixture was then added to

311

VeroE6 cells and incubated for 1 hr, after which the cells were washed and further

312

incubated in medium for 8 hrs. The cells were then fixed and stained using a rabbit

313

anti-SARS-CoV serum (Sino Biological) and a secondary peroxidase-labelled goat

314

anti-rabbit IgG (Dako). The signal was developed using a precipitate forming TMB

315

substrate (True Blue, KPL) and the number of infected cells per well were counted

316

using the ImmunoSpot® Image analyzer (CTL Europe GmbH). The half maximal

Suppl. Fig.1. ELISA cross-reactivity of antibody-containing supernatants of
SARS-S H2L2 hybridomas towards SARS2-S1. SARS-S targeting hybridomas
were developed by conventional hybridoma technology from immunized H2L2
transgenic mice (Harbour Biomed), as described before1. These mice - carrying
genes encoding the heavy and light chain human immunoglobulin repertoire - were
sequentially immunized with 2-week intervals with trimeric spike protein
ectodomains (Secto) of three human coronaviruses from the betacoronavirus genus
in the following order: 1. HCoV-OC43-Secto, 2. SARS-CoV-Secto, 3. MERS-CoVSecto, 4. HCoV-OC43-Secto, 5. SARS-CoV-Secto, 6. MERS-CoV-Secto. Four days after
the last immunization, splenocytes and lymph node lymphocytes were harvested
and hybridomas were generated. Antibodies in the cell supernatants were tested for
ELISA-reactivity against SARS-Secto, SARS-S1, SARS-S1A and SARS2-S1. Of the
51 hybridoma supernatants that reacted with SARS-Secto only, 23 reacted with
SARS-S1A, 22 with SARS-S1 but not SARS-S1A, 6 with SARS-Secto but not SARSS1. Four of the 51 SARS-Secto hybridoma supernatants reacted with SARS2-S1
(see column on the right). The table displays ELISA-signal intensities (OD450nm
values) of hybridoma supernatants for the different antigens.

SARS-Secto, SARS2-Secto, SARS-S1B and SARS2-S1B was measured using
biolayer interferometry at 25°C, as described previously21. Kinetic binding assay
was performed by loading 47D11 mAb at optimal concentration (42 nM) on antihuman Fc biosensor for 10 mins. Antigen association step was performed by
incubating the sensor with a range of concentrations of the recombinant spike
ectodomain (1600-800-400-200-100-50-25 nM) for 10 min, followed by a
dissociation step in PBS for 60 min. The kinetics constants were calculated using

Suppl. Fig.7. Cell-cell fusion inhibition assay. The cell-cell-fusion
inhibition assay was performed as described previously with some
adaptations1. VeroE6 cells were seeded with density of 105 cells per ml.
After reaching 70~80% confluency, cells were transfected with plasmids
encoding full length SARS-S, SARS2-S and MERS-S – C-terminally fused
to GFP - using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The furin recognition site in
the SARS2-S was mutated (R682RAR to A682AAR) to inhibit cleavage of the
protein by endogenous furin and allow trypsin-induced syncytia formation.
Two days post transfection, cells were pretreated DMEM only or DMEM with
20 μg/ml mAbs for 1 h and subsequently treated with DMEM with 15 μg/ml
trypsin (to activate the spike fusion function) in the absence or presence of
20 μg/ml mAbs (47D11 crossreactive SARS-S and SARS2-S, 35F4 reactive
to SARS-S, 7.7G6 reactive to MERS-S). After incubation at 37°C for 2 hrs,
the cells were fixed with 2% PFA in PBS for 20 min at room temperature
and stained for nuclei with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Cells
expressing the S-GFP proteins were detected by fluorescence microscopy
and S-mediated cell-cell fusion was observed by the formation of
(fluorescent) multi-nucleated syncytia. The fluorescence images were
recorded using a Leica SpeII confocal microscope. The experiment was
performed twice, data from a representative experiment are shown.

Suppl. Fig.8. Protein sequence alignment of the S1B receptor binding
domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins by
ClustalW. Numbering denotes the residue position in the full-length spike protein
of SARS-CoV (Genbank: AAP13441.1) and SARS-CoV-2 (Genbank:
QHD43416.1). Asterisks (*) indicated fully conserved residues, the colon symbol
(:) indicates conservation between groups of very similar properties, and the
period symbol (.) indicates conservation between groups of weakly similar
properties. Sequences corresponding to the S1B receptor binding core domain
and the receptor binding subdomain are colored in blue and orange,
respectively. The fourteen residues that are involved in binding of SARS-CoV
S1B to human ACE2 are highlighted in grey1.
