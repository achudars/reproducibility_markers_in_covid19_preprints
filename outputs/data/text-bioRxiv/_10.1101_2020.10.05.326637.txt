Abstract
Effective and affordable treatments for patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), are needed. We report in vitro efficacy of Artemisia annua extracts as well as
artemisinin, artesunate, and artemether against SARS-CoV-2. The latter two are
approved active pharmaceutical ingredients of anti-malarial drugs.
Proof-of-concept for prophylactic efficacy of the extracts was obtained using a plaquereduction assay in VeroE6 cells. Subsequent concentration-response studies using a highthroughput antiviral assay, based on immunostaining of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein,
revealed that pretreatment and treatment with extracts, artemisinin, and artesunate
inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of VeroE6 cells. In treatment assays, artesunate (50%
effective concentration (EC50): 7 µg/mL) was more potent than the tested plant extracts
(128-260 µg/mL) or artemisinin (151 µg/mL) and artemether (>179 µg/mL), while

generally EC50 in pretreatment assays were slightly higher. The selectivity index (SI),
calculated based on treatment and cell viability assays, was highest for artemisinin (54),
and roughly equal for the extracts (5-10), artesunate (6) and artemether (<7). Similar
results were obtained in human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells. Peak plasma concentrations of
artesunate exceeding EC50 values can be achieved. Clinical studies are required to
further evaluate the utility of these compounds as COVID-19 treatment.

Introduction
The pandemic with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1,2 has
worldwide been associated with over 1 million deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19).3, 4, 5 This febrile respiratory and systemic illness is highly contagious and in many cases
life-threatening. Remdesivir, the only antiviral drug with proven in vitro and clinical efficacy,
was approved for treatment of COVID-19.6 Still, COVID-19 treatment remains largely
supportive with an urgent need to identify effective antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. An
attractive approach is repurposing drugs already licensed for other diseases. Teas of A. annua
plants have been employed to treat malaria in Traditional Chinese Medicine, as well as in
clinical trials,7,

and are used widely in many African countries, albeit against WHO

recommendations. Artemisinin (Figure 1, 1), a sesquiterpene lactone with a peroxide moiety
and one of many bioactive compounds present in A. annua, is the active ingredient to treat
malaria infections.9, 10 The artemisinin derivatives artesunate (Figure 1, 2) and artemether
(Figure 1, 3) exhibit improved pharmacokinetic properties and are the key active
pharmaceutical ingredients (API) of WHO-recommended anti-malaria combination therapies
used in millions of adults and children each year with few side effects.11 A. annua extracts are
active against different viruses, including SARS-CoV.12,

Therefore, we set out to

determine whether A. annua extracts, as well as pure artemisinin, artesunate, and artemether

are active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Artemisinin-based drugs would be attractive
repurposing candidates for treatment of COVID-19 considering their excellent safety profiles
in humans, and since they are readily available for worldwide distribution at a relatively low
cost.

Results
Extracts and compounds. A. annua plants grown from a cultivated seed line in Kentucky,
USA, were extracted using either absolute ethanol or distilled water at 50 °C for 200 minutes,
as described in Materials and Methods and Supplementary Information (Figure S1). For a third
preparation, to protect artemisinin from degradation by reducing agents, ground coffee – a
natural source of polyphenols such as chlorogenic acid (Figure 1, (4)) that also exhibit mild
antiviral activities15, 16 – was coextracted with the plant material using ethanol (see supporting
information). Solids were removed by filtration and the solvents were evaporated. The
extracted materials were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (both ethanol extracts) or a
DMSO:water mixture (3:1 for aqueous extract) and filtered (see supporting information for
details). Artemisinin (Figure 1, (1)) was synthesized and purified following a published
procedure,17 while artesunate (Figure 1, (2)) and artemether (Figure 1, (3)) were obtained from
commercial sources.
Plaque-reduction assays in VeroE6 cells for in vitro proof-of-concept of the pretreatment
efficacy of A. annua extracts and artemisinin. To initially screen whether extracts and pure
artemisinin were active against SARS-CoV-2, their antiviral activity was tested by pretreating
VeroE6 cells at different time points during 120 minutes with selected concentrations of the
extracts or compounds prior to infection with the first European SARS-CoV-2 isolated in
München (SARS-CoV-2/human/Germany/BavPat 1/2020). The virus-drug mixture was then
removed and cells were overlaid with medium containing 1.3% carboxymethylcellulose to
prevent virus release into the medium. DMSO was used as a negative control. Plaque numbers
were determined either by indirect immunofluorescence using a mixture of antibodies to
SARS-CoV N protein18 or by staining with crystal violet.19 The addition of either ethanolic or
aqueous A. annua extracts prior to virus addition resulted in reduced plaque formation in a
concentration dependent manner with median effective concentration (EC50) values estimated

to range between 5 and 168 µg/mL (Supplemental Figure S2A-C). Artemisinin exhibited little
antiviral activity with an EC50 >220 µg/mL (Supplemental Figure S2D).
Efficacy of A. Annua extracts in high-throughput antiviral in vitro assays in VeroE6 cells.
Concentration-response experiments using the Danish SARS-CoV-2 isolate SARS-CoV2/human/Denmark/DK-AHH1/2020 were performed employing a 96-well plate based highthroughput antiviral assay, allowing for multiple replicates per concentration, as described in
Materials and Methods and Supplementary Information (Figures S3 and S4).20 Seven replicates
were measured at each concentration and a range of concentrations was evaluated to increase
data accuracy when compared to the plaque-reduction assay, which was carried out in
duplicates. Extracts or compounds were added to VeroE6 cells either 1.5 h prior to
(pretreatment (pt)) or 1 h post infection (treatment (t)), respectively, followed by a two-day
incubation of virus with extracts or compounds. Both protocols yielded similar results, with
slightly lower EC50 values observed for treatment assays.
The ethanolic extracts showed similar potency: for A. annua alone EC50 were 173 µg/mL (pt)
and 142 µg/mL (t) and for A. annua with coffee EC50 were 176 µg/mL (pt) and 128 µg/mL (t)
(Figures 2, 3 and Table 1). The aqueous extract was slightly less potent with EC50 being 390
µg/mL (pt) and 260 µg/mL (t) (Figures 2, 3 and Table 1). With all extracts, almost complete
virus inhibition was achieved at high concentrations: For the A. annua ethanolic extract at 333
µg/mL (pt) and 444 µg/mL (t), for the A. annua + coffee ethanolic extract at 300 µg/mL (pt)
and 267 µg/mL (t), and for the A. annua aqueous extract at 875 µg/mL (pt) and 1009 µg/mL
(t) (Figures 2 and 3). The highest evaluated concentrations used in our assays were informed
by the cytotoxicity of the extracts or compounds, as only concentrations resulting in cell
viability greater than 90% were evaluated (Figures 2, 3, S5 and Table 1). Cell viability assays
revealed median cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) of 1,044 µg/mL (A. annua ethanolic extract),
632 µg/mL (A. annua + coffee ethanolic extract), and 2,721 µg/mL (A. annua aqueous extract)
(Figures 2, 3, S5 and Table 1). Selectivity indexes (SI) were determined by dividing CC50 by
EC50 and revealed similar results for the A. annua ethanolic extract being 6 (pt) and 7 (t), the
A. annua + coffee ethanolic extract being 3 (pt) and 5 (t) as well as the A. annua aqueous extract
being 7 (pt) and 10 (t) (Table 1).
The two ethanolic extracts were diluted with DMSO that by itself caused reduction of cell
viability to <90% when used at a 1:28 dilution, but not at dilutions ≥1:42 (Figure S6). Thus,
the cytotoxicity observed when using the extracts at relatively high concentrations was most

likely not caused by DMSO (Figures 2 and 3). DMSO at dilutions >1:152 including the
dilutions used in antiviral assays did not have antiviral effects, defined as reduction of residual
infectivity to <70% (Figure S6). Thus, the observed antiviral effect of the tested extracts was
most likely not caused by DMSO. A pure coffee extract estimated to contain 2.5-fold higher
coffee concentrations than the A. annua + coffee ethanolic extract did not result in reduction
of cell viability to <90% at dilutions ≥1:28 (Figure S7). The cytotoxicity observed when using
the A. annua + coffee extract at relatively high concentrations was most likely not caused by
coffee (Figures 2 and 3). Interestingly, coffee extract alone showed some antiviral activity at
dilutions ≤1:273 (Figure S7). Thus, the observed antiviral effect of the A. annua + coffee
extract may be influenced by coffee.
Efficacy of artemisinin and its derivatives in high-throughput antiviral in vitro assays in
VeroE6 cells. A. annua plants contain, in addition to many other bioactive compounds,
artemisinin that is responsible for the potent anti-malarial activities of A. annua. To investigate
whether artemisinin is the active component responsible for the antiviral activities of the plant
extracts described above, the pure compound and synthetic derivatives were tested in
pretreatment and treatment assays. Artemisinin was found to be active in SARS-CoV-2 assays
with EC50 238 µg/mL (pt) and 151 µg/mL (t) (Figures 2, 3, and Table 1). Close to complete
virus inhibition was achieved in both assays at the highest concentration evaluated in the
assays, 893 (pt) and 1208 µg/mL (t). The SI for artemisinin is relatively high, 34 (pt) and 54
(t), based on a CC50 of 8,216 µg/mL (Figures 2, 3, S6, and Table 1). The observed cytotoxicity
of artemisinin appeared to be at least partially caused by DMSO, as cytotoxicity was only
observed at drug dilutions where DMSO was found to reduce cell viability (Figures 2, 3, and
S6). The antiviral effects observed when using artemisinin at relatively high concentrations
were most likely not due to the diluent DMSO (Figures 2, 3, and S6).
The synthetic artemisinin derivative artesunate, the API of WHO-recommended first-line
malaria therapies with improved pharmacokinetic properties, showed the highest potency of
all compounds tested, with EC50 being 12 µg/mL (pt) and 7 µg/mL (t) (Figures 2 and 3). In
the treatment assay, close to complete virus inhibition was achieved at the highest evaluated
concentration (15 µg/mL), as determined by cytotoxicity data, compared to 69% inhibition at
this concentration in the pretreatment assay. Higher artesunate concentrations were not used
considering its cytotoxicity in this assay (CC50: 41 µg/mL) (Figures 2, 3, S5, and Table 1). SI
of 3 (pt) and 6 (t) were calculated (Table 1). The cytotoxicity and the antiviral effects observed

when using artesunate at relatively high concentrations were most likely not due to the diluent
DMSO (Figures 2, 3, and S6).
Artemether, another artemisinin-derivative that is used globally as the active ingredient in
malaria medications, did not show a significant antiviral effect at concentrations of up to 179
µg/mL (Figures 2 and 3). Considering artemether´s cytotoxicity (CC50 of 1,220 µg/mL), an SI
< 7 was calculated (Figures 2, 3, S5, and Table 1). The cytotoxicity observed when using
artemether at relatively high concentrations was most likely not due to the diluent DMSO
(Figures 2, 3, and S6).
Efficacy of artemisinin-based treatment in high-throughput antiviral in vitro assays using
Huh7.5 cells. The observed antiviral activity in these assays is effected by the ability of the
pure compounds, and the compounds contained in the extracts, to enter the cells as well as their
rates of metabolism within the cells. To exclude major differences in potency of extracts and
compounds in human cells, treatment assays were also carried out in human hepatoma Huh7.5
cells, adding extracts or compounds to the cells immediately post infection. Overall, the
ethanolic A. annua extract, artemisinin, artesunate, and artemether showed similar efficacy in
Huh7.5 compared to VeroE6 cells. Artesunate (EC50: 11 µg/mL) was again found to be the
most potent compound with close to complete virus inhibition at 22 µg/mL and an SI of 8 as
determined by a CC50 of 93 µg/mL (Figures 4, S8 and Table 1). Artemether, (EC50: 135
µg/mL) with close to complete virus inhibition at 179 µg/mL, had an SI of only 2, based on
CC50 of 303 µg/mL (Figures 4, S8 and Table 1). In Huh7.5 cells, the EC50 for the ethanolic
A. annua extract was 118 µg/mL, with 76% virus inhibition at the highest evaluated
concentration (150 µg/mL), as determined by cytotoxicity data; the CC50 was 483 µg/mL and
the SI was 4 (Figures 4, S8 and Table 1). Artemisinin showed no significant virus inhibition at
the highest evaluated concentration (208 µg/mL) and an SI <24, based on a CC50 of 5,066
µg/mL (Figures 4, S8 and Table 1).
In Huh7.5 cells, DMSO caused reduction of cell viability to <90% when used at a 1:28 dilution,
but not at dilutions ≥1:56 (Figure S9). Thus, the cytotoxicity observed when using the ethanolic
extract or the pure compounds at relatively high concentrations was most likely not caused by
DMSO (Figure 4). DMSO at dilutions >1:179 including dilutions used in antiviral assays did
not have any antiviral effects (Figure S9). Thus, the observed antiviral effect of the ethanolic
A. annua extract and the pure compounds was most likely not caused by DMSO.

Discussion
Here, we demonstrate the in vitro efficacy of artemisinin-based treatments against SARS-CoV2. Initially, several A. annua extracts, as well as artemisinin, were screened for antiviral activity
using a plaque-reduction assay in a pretreatment setting using a German SARS-CoV-2 strain
from Munich. Based on these findings, three A. annua extracts and pure, synthetic artemisinin,
artesunate, and artemether were studied in detail to establish concentration-response curves for
extracts and compounds for pretreatment and treatment settings using a Danish SARS-CoV-2
strain from Copenhagen.
High-throughput antiviral assays facilitated testing of drug concentrations in multiple
replicates resulting in accurate EC50 values. The EC50 values in the pretreatment setting were
slightly higher than EC50 values determined in the treatment setting possibly because preincubation may have a negative impact on the stability of the extracts and pure compounds.
Generally, EC50 values depend on the specific assay employed. While the type of assay we
used with a single treatment and subsequent incubation of virus and drug is state of the art for
antiviral efficacy measurements, assay modifications, such as repeated administration of
treatment, might result in slightly different EC50 values. Since the active antiviral substance
may be an artemisinin metabolite, such that the artemisinin derivatives and extracts can be
considered prodrugs, we used the human Huh7.5 cell line to confirm the EC50 determined in
VeroE6 cells.
While A. annua extracts have been considered “natural combination therapies” as they contain
several bioactive compounds,21 the WHO discourages the use of non-pharmaceutical forms of
artemisinin as a therapeutic option for malaria due to lack of standardization with its sourcing
and preparation, implying risks of suboptimal efficacy and resistance development.22 In this
context, it is important to note that the extracts used in this study were prepared from plants
grown under optimized and standardized conditions, in a manner where concentrations of the
extracted material are reproducible.
Interestingly, we found that coffee extracts exhibited in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.
While modelling studies suggested that ingredients in coffee such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic
acid, and tannins show activity against SARS-CoV-2,23 we here provide in vitro evidence of
such an effect. Future studies are needed to elucidate the effect of coffee and active ingredients
on SARS-CoV-2 in detail. In addition, future studies might address whether A. annua or active
ingredients and coffee extracts show antagonistic, additive, or synergistic effects on SARSCoV-2.

While compiling data for this study, Cao et al. reported efficacy of artemisinin derivatives
against a SARS-CoV-2 isolate from Wuhan in VeroE6 cells.24 While extracts were not studied,
the efficacy of artesunate was similar with EC50 of 13 µM compared to 18 µM in our VeroE6
treatment assay. Interestingly, EC50 for artemether and artemisinin were 8 fold and >8 fold
higher in our VeroE6 treatment assay compared to values reported by Cao et al. This difference
might be due to the nature of the assay employed. The assay used by Cao et al. was based on
viral RNA determinations, the viral inoculum was removed post infection / prior to treatment
and perhaps most importantly, the assay was terminated 24 hours post infection, which is
expected to result in comparatively lower EC50 for compounds with an immediate antiviral
effect but a limited capacity to control the virus, either due to limited antiviral efficacy or due
to limited stability during a 48-hour treatment period. Importantly, we report for the first time
the efficacy of the compounds in a human cell line (Huh7.5) in addition to efficacy in the
monkey cell line VeroE6. Finally, in our study we confirm efficacy of artemisinin-based
treatment for two European SARS-CoV-2 strains from Germany and Denmark, which are more
closely related to the majority of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide than the Wuhan
strain.
Artesunate, the API in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved malaria treatments,
showed the highest potency against SARS-CoV-2 among the extracts and pure compounds
tested in VeroE6 and Huh7.5 cells. The extracts proved more potent than artemisinin and
artemether that exhibited only borderline antiviral efficacy considering results in VeroE6 and
Huh7.5 cells. With SI of below 10, except for artemisinin, a relatively low therapeutic window
exists. It should be noted that certain drugs such as digoxin with SI values as low as 2 are used
successfully in the clinic.25 Among the tested extracts and pure compounds, only artesunate
showed EC50 values in the range of clinically achievable plasma and tissue concentrations.
When the typically used doses of 2 to 2.4 mg/kg intravenously were administered, reported
peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) were between 19.4 and 29.7 µg/mL in patients.26 Based
on these observations and our treatment data in VeroE6 and Huh7.5 cells, the calculated
Cmax/EC50 values are between 2.5 and 4.2. In animal studies following administration of a
single dose of artesunate, tissue concentrations including lung, kidney, intestine, and spleen
concentrations were several-fold higher than plasma concentrations.27 In contrast, following
administration of artemisinin, artemether, and A. annua teas, Cmax values between 311−776
ng/mL were reported, which is close to three orders of magnitude below EC50 values for
SARS-CoV-2. Plasma and tissue concentrations that can be achieved with standardized A.

annua extracts with high artemisinin content used in this study still have to be determined. In
vivo, immunomodulatory effects of artemisinin-based treatments have been reported for this
class of drugs.28 Such effects that may involve cytokine signaling cannot be monitored in in
vitro assays performed here and will have to be carefully studied in subsequent clinical
evaluations.
Materials and Methods
Extraction. Solvent (250 mL ethanol or distilled water) was heated to 50 °C in an Erlenmeyer
flask. Dried plant material (50g for ethanol, 25g for water) or dried plant material and
preground coffee (50g, 50g) was added to the solvent and stirred for 200 minutes. The mixture
was filtered and solid material washed with fresh ethanol or water. The solvent was removed
by rotary evaporation and solid material stored at -30 °C prior to sample preparation.
Sample Preparation. Dried extract was warmed to room temperature. The required sample
mass was removed using a spatula. DMSO (3 mL, ethanol extracts) or DMSO:water (3:1, 8
mL water extract) was added and the mixture was heated (40 °C) to ensure solvation. The
solution was filtered using a syringe filter and stored in a snap-close vial.
Cell Culture. At FU Berlin, african green monkey kidney VeroE6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586)
were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM; PAN Biotech,
Aidenbach, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (PAN Biotech), 100 IU/mL
penicillin G and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany).
At CO-HEP, african green monkey kidney VeroE6 cells (kind gift from J. Dubuisson) as well
as human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells28 were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s
Modified Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) containing 10% heat inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA) and 100 U/mL penicillin + 100 µL
streptomycin (Gibco/Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, California, USA). Cells were subcultured every 2-3 days using trypsin (Sigma, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA) to maintain a subconfluent cell layer.
Virus isolates. The SARS-CoV-2 BavPat 1 isolate (SARS-CoV-2/human/Germany/BavPat 1/
2020 was provided by Dr. Daniela Niemeyer and Dr. Christian Drosten (Charité, Berlin,
Germany) and obtained from an outbreak in Munich, Germany, in February 2020
(BetaCoV/Germany/BavPat1/2020).

VeroE6 cells and generation of a sequence confirmed 2nd viral passage stock with an
infectivity titer of 5.5 log TCID50/mL as described in Ramirez et al.20
Plaque reduction antiviral assay. Antiviral activity of artemisinin derivatives was evaluated
on VeroE6 cells grown overnight in 12-well plates (Sarstedt) at a density of approximately
5×105 cells/well. Cells were incubated in the presence of ten-fold serial dilutions of the
compounds for 15 min, 30 min, 60 min or 120 min, before the virus was added at a
concentration of approximately 200 plaque-forming-units (PFU) per well for 120 min. The
virus-drug mixture was removed, and cells were overlaid with MEM-FBS containing 1.3%
carboxymethylcellulose to prevent virus release into the medium. DMSO in cell culture
medium at a 1:100 dilution (the highest concentration relative to the preparations of extracts /
compounds) was used as a negative control, and virus plaque numbers were determined by
manual counting of plaques following indirect immunofluorescence (IF) using a mixture of
antibodies to SARS-CoV N protein18 or following staining with crystal violet.19 For IF, cells
were fixed with 4% formalin and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100. Unspecific binding
was blocked with 1% FBS in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.25% Triton X-100
(PBS-T) at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were incubated with the anti-N monoclonal
antibodies (1:25 dilution in PBS-T) for 45 min, followed by incubation with secondary
antibody (Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-mouse at a 1:500 dilution; Thermo Fisher). In each
assay, each concentration was tested in one replicate culture; 5 infected and DMSO control
treated cultures were included in each assay. Plaque counts recorded in each infected treated
culture were related to the average count of the five control cultures to calculate the number of
plaques as percent relative to the control. Two independent assays were carried out. Datapoints
are means of two replicate cultures from the two independent assays with error bars reflecting
the standard deviations (SD) (Figure S2). Selected concentrations were only tested in one of
the assays and for these datapoints are based on single replicates. The MOI for infection was
chosen aiming at on average 150-250 plaques per culture.
High-throughput pretreatment and treatment antiviral assay in VeroE6 cells. 96-well
based antiviral assays in VeroE6 cells were developed based on assays previously established
for evaluation of the efficacy of antivirals against hepatitis C virus.30, 31 VeroE6 cells were
plated at 10,000 cells per well of poly-D-lysine-coated 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Rochester, NY, USA). For pretreatment assays, the next day, medium was
exchanged to medium containing extracts or compounds adding 50 µL per well. After 1.5 h of

well, resulting in the specified concentrations of extracts or compounds. For treatment assays,
the next day, medium was exchanged by adding 50 µL of fresh medium per well. Then, cells
were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2/human/Denmark/DK-AHH1/2020 at MOI 0.0016 by
adding 50 µL of diluted virus stock per well. After 1 hour of incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2,
50 µL of medium containing extracts or compounds were added resulting in the specified
concentrations; alternatively, 50 µL of medium containing diluent (DMSO) or additive (coffee
extract) were added resulting in the specified dilutions. For both assays, each
concentration/dilution was tested in seven replicates; 14 infected and nontreated as well as 12
noninfected and nontreated control wells were included in each assay. After 48±2 hours
incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, cultures were immunostained for SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein and evaluated as described below.
High-throughput treatment antiviral assay in Huh7.5 cells. Huh7.5 cells were plated at
8,000 cells per well of flat bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Roskilde,
Denmark). The next day, cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2/human/Denmark/DKAHH1/2020 at MOI 0.0198 by adding 50 µL of diluted virus stock per well. Directly after, 50
µL of medium containing extracts or compounds were added resulting in the specified
concentrations; alternatively, 50 µL of medium containing diluent (DMSO) were added
resulting in the specified dilutions. Each concentration was tested in seven replicates; 14
infected and nontreated as well as 12 noninfected and nontreated control wells were included
in the assay. After 72±2 hours incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, cultures were immunostained
for SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and evaluated as described below.
Immunostaining and evaluation of 96-well plates for high-throughput antiviral assays.
Cells were fixed and virus was inactivated by immersion of plates in methanol (J.T.Baker,
Gliwice, Poland) for 20 min. Unless specified, immunostaining was done at room temperature.
Plates were washed twice with PBS (Sigma, Gillingham, UK) containing 0.1% Tween-20
(Sigma, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by
incubation with 3% H2O2 for ten minutes followed by two washes with PBS containing 0.1%
Tween-20 and blocking with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) and 0.2% skim milk powder (Easis, Aarhus, Denmark) for 30 minutes. Following
removal of blocking solution, plates were incubated with primary antibody SARS-CoV-2 spike
chimeric monoclonal antibody (Sino Biological #40150-D004, Beijing, China) diluted 1:5000
in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% skim milk powder overnight at 4 ℃.
Following two washes with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, plates were incubated with
secondary antibody F(ab')2-Goat anti-Human IgG Fc Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody,

pre-adsorbed (Abcamab#98595, Cambridge, UK) diluted 1:2000 in PBS containing 1% bovine
serum albumin and 0.2% skim milk powder for 2 h. Following two washes with PBS containing
0.1% Tween-20, SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein was visualized using DAB substrate
(Immunologic # BS04-110, Duiven, Netherlands). Spike protein positive cells were counted
automatically using an ImmunoSpot series 5 UV analyzer (CTL Europe GmbH, Bonn,
Germany) as described.30,31,32 The average count of 12 noninfected nontreated control wells,
which was usually <50, was subtracted from the count of each infected well. Counts recorded
in each infected treated well were related to the average count of 14 infected nontreated control
wells to calculate % residual infectivity. Datapoints are means of seven replicates with standard
errors of the means (SEM). Sigmoidal dose response curves were fitted and EC50 values were
calculated with GraphPad Prism 8.0.0 using a bottom constraint of 0 and the formula Y=
Top/(1+10^((LogEC50-X)*HillSlope)). The MOI for infection was chosen aiming at on
average 3000-4000 counts per well for VeroE6 cells and on average 300-600 counts per well
for the less permissive Huh7.5 cells in infected nontreated control wells upon termination of
the respective assays. Representative 96-well images from assays in VeroE6 cells are shown
in Figure S3 and representative images of single wells are show in Figure S4.
Cell viability assays in VeroE6 and Huh7.5 cells. To evaluate cytotoxic effects of the tested
extracts, compounds, diluents (DMSO) and additive (coffee extract), cell viability was
monitored using the CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). VeroE6 cells or Huh7.5 cells were plated at 10,000 or 8,000 cells per well
of flat bottom 96-well plates, respectively (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark). The
next day, medium was exchanged to contain specified concentrations of extracts or compounds
or dilutions of DMSO and coffee extract adding 100 µL per well. Each concentration or dilution
was tested in 3 replicates; at least 6 nontreated control wells were included in the assay. For
VeroE6 cells, after 48±2 h, and for Huh7.5 cells, after 72±2 h of incubation at 37 °C and 5%
CO2, 20 µL CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Reagent was added per well and plates were
incubated for 1.5 to 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, prior to recording absorbance at 492 nm using a
FLUOstar OPTIMA 96-well plate reader (BMG LABTECH, Offenburg, Germany).
Absorbance recorded in each well was related to the average absorbance of nontreated control
wells to calculate the percentage of cell viability. Datapoints are means of triplicates with SEM.
Sigmoidal dose response curves were fitted and median cytotoxic concentration (CC50) values
were calculated with GraphPad Prism 8.0.0 using a bottom constraint of 0 and the formula Y=
Top/(1+10^((LogCC50-X)*HillSlope)) as further specified in Figures S5 and S8. To rule out
