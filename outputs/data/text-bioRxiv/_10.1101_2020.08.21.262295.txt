Abstract

24

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that emerged in 2019 and is now classified in the genus

25

Coronavirus with closely related SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is highly pathogenic in humans and is

26

classified as a biosafety level (BSL)-3 pathogen, which makes manipulating it relatively difficult

27

due to its infectious nature. To circumvent the need for BSL-3 laboratories, an alternative assay was

28

developed that avoids live virus and instead uses a recombinant VSV expressing luciferase and

29

possesses the full length or truncated spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, to measure

30

SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies under BSL2 conditions, a chemiluminescence reduction

31

neutralization test (CRNT) for SARS-CoV-2 was developed. The neutralization values of the serum

32

samples collected from hospitalized patients with COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative

33

donors against the pseudotyped virus infection evaluated by the CRNT were compared with

34

antibody titers determined from an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The CRNT, which used

35

whole blood collected from hospitalized patients with COVID-19, was also examined. As a result,

36

the inhibition of pseudotyped virus infection was specifically observed in both serum and whole

37

blood and was also correlated with the results of the IFA. In conclusion, the CRNT for COVID-19

38

is a convenient assay system that can be performed in a BSL-2 laboratory with high specificity and

39

sensitivity for evaluating the occurrence of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

42

Recently, the infectious Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged and is caused by a newly

43

identified coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1).

44

Globally, COVID-19 severely impacted health and socio-economic conditions. Currently, no safe

45

and effective antivirals or other therapies for COVID-19 exist, although some drugs, such as

46

remdesivir, showed limited efficacy for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 (2, 3). Similar to

47

other diseases, proper treatment requires an accurate diagnosis. Therefore, establishing diagnostics,

48

such as the detection of target viral genes and antibodies, is also required.

49

The genome structure of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome

50

coronavirus SARS-CoV, which is the causative agent for severe acute respiratory syndrome

51

(SARS) that showed high mortality and morbidity in the late 2002-to the middle of 2003 outbreak,

52

which mainly occurred in China (4). The proteins of SARS-CoV-2 consist of two large

53

polyproteins: ORF1a and ORF1ab; four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M),

54

and nucleocapsid (N); and eight accessory proteins: ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7b, ORF8a,

55

ORF8b, and ORF9b. S protein is a glycoprotein, which is responsible for binding and penetration of

56

target cells. The S protein is also important for induction of protective humoral and cellular

57

immunity during infection. The S protein is the main target with which the neutralizing antibodies

58

react. Measuring the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies is important for proper diagnosis, to

59

study the serological epidemiology and determine infection control of SARS-CoV-2.

60

The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and

61

immunochromatography utilize the principle of antigen-antibody reaction and were developed as

62

serodiagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

63

The specificity of these assays is fairly high, but problems are present such as relatively low

64

sensitivity and a high rate of false positives. The neutralization antibody test (NT) for serum using

65

live SARS-CoV-2 is a method in which inhibition of the serum upon viral infection is observed in

66

the presence of neutralizing antibodies against proteins involved in viral binding and penetration in

67

the serum. Generally, the NT is the standard method used to confirm the presence of neutralizing

68

antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. However, this method takes a long time because it depends on the

69

growth of the virus, and it is not a simple measuring system in terms of complicated handling and

70

biosafety for highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, recently, a pseudotyped virus system

71

based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or pseudotyped particle systems based on lentivirus or

72

retrovirus were developed for the detection of neutralizing antibodies instead of using infectious

73

and authentic viruses (5-7). However, a significant need exists to evaluate the neutralizing antibody

74

against SARS-CoV-2 in the clinical setting. Therefore, the ability to perform the NT under lower

75

BSL laboratory conditions is preferred.

76

In this study, an antibody detection system based on the chemiluminescence reduction

77

neutralization test (CRNT) and using the S protein-based pseudotyped viruses was developed. The

78

correlation between antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 determined by CRNT were evaluated

79

along with those determined by the IFA in which recombinant S protein was used as an antigen.

80

The usefulness of the CRNT system for detecting neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 that

81

was newly developed in this study is presented.

Materials and Methods

85

Plasmids

86

The cDNAs of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were obtained by chemical synthesis with

87

optimization for the humanized codon (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA). The S

88

cDNA of SARS-CoV-2 was cloned into the pCAGGS expression vector (8). The resulting plasmid

89

was designated as pCAG-SARS-CoV-2. The plasmid, which contains the S protein gene with a 19

90

aa truncation at the C-terminus, was constructed using the cDNA of pCAG-SARS-CoV-2. The S

91

proteins with the 19 aa deletion of coronaviruses were previously reported to show increased

92

efficiency regarding incorporation into virions of VSV (9, 10).

93
94

Cells

95

Human (Huh7 and 293T), monkey (Vero), hamster (BHK and CHO), and mouse (NIH3T3) cell

96

lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Summit Pharmaceuticals

97

International, Tokyo, Japan). All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium

98

(DMEM; Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) containing 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum

99

(FBS).

100
101

Generation of pseudotyped VSVs

102

Pseudotyped VSVs bearing the S protein, the 19 aa-truncated S protein of SARS-CoV-2, or VSV-G

103

were generated as described below. Briefly, 293T cells were grown to 80% confluence on

104

collagen-coated tissue culture plates and then transfected with each expression vector:

105

pCAG-SARS-CoV-2 S-full, pCAG-SARS-CoV-2 S-t19, and pCAG-VSV-G. After 24 h of

106

incubation, the cells transfected with each plasmid were infected with G-complemented (*G)

107

VSV∆G/Luc (*G-VSV∆G/Luc)(11) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 per cell. Then, the

108

virus was adsorbed and extensively washed four times with 10% FBS DMEM. After 24 h of

109

incubation, to remove cell debris, the culture supernatants containing pseudotyped VSVs were

110

centrifuged, and then, they stored at −80°C until ready for use. The pseudotyped VSV bearing

111

SARS-CoV-2 S protein or SARS-CoV-2 truncated S protein are referred to as Sfullpv or St19pv,

112

respectively. The infectivity of Sfullpv, St19pv, or VSVpv to 293T cells was assessed by measuring

113

the luciferase activity. The value of the relative light unit (RLU) of luciferase was determined using

114

a PicaGene Luminescence Kit (TOYO B-Net Co., LTD, Tokyo, Japan) and GloMax Navigator

115

System G2000 (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

117

Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining and Immunoblotting

118

Transfection of 293T cells occurred with pCAG-SARS-CoV-2 Sfull, pCAG-SARS-CoV-2 St19, or

119

VSV-G. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were collected and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline

120

(PBS) containing 1% NP40. Then, the lysates were centrifuged to separate insoluble pellets from

121

supernatants. The supernatants were used as samples. The Sfullpv or St19pv, which were generated

122

as described above, were pelleted through a 20% (wt/vol) sucrose cushion at 25,000 rpm for 2 h in

123

an SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Tokyo, Japan). Then, the pellets were resuspended in PBS. Each

124

sample that was boiled in loading buffer was subjected to 10% sodium dodecyl

125

sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). According to the manufacturer’s protocol,

126

the proteins in the gel were stained with CBB Stain One (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.). Next, the proteins

127

in another gel were electrophoretically transferred to a methanol-activated polyvinylidene difluoride

128

(PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and reacted with COVID-19 hospitalized patient sera

129

(#12). Then, immune complexes were visualized with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration

130

Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and detected by an LAS3000 analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan).

132

Blood samples

133

Twenty-three serum samples were collected from hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were

134

admitted to the University of Toyama Hospital, Toyama, Japan. In addition, nineteen serum

135

samples were collected from COVID-19 PCR-negative donors at the University of Toyama

136

Hospital. The diagnosis of COVID-19 in all patients or donors was assessed using the real-time

137

PCR method with specific primers, which were developed at the National Institute of Infectious

138

Diseases, Japan (12).

139

By using a blood collection tube containing EDTA, whole blood samples were obtained from 5

Neutralization assays with patient blood samples

143

The patient sera used in this study were collected from participants after obtaining informed consent.

144

To examine neutralization of the human serum or whole blood samples against pseudotyped viruses,

145

Vero cells were treated with serially diluted sera or whole blood of convalescent patients with

146

COVID-19 or PCR-negative donors and then inoculated with Sfullpv, St19pv, or VSVpv. To

147

remove hematopoietic cells from whole blood samples, centrifugation was performed at 2,000 × g

148

for 5 min. Infectivity of the pseudotyped viruses were determined by measuring luciferase activities

149

after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C.

150
151

Immunofluorescence assay (IFA)

152

For the IFA, BHK cells transfected with pCAG-SARS-CoV-2 S-full were fixed with

153

acetone-methanol (1:1) at 4 °C for 20 min. Fixed cells were reacted with the test serum samples,

154

which were diluted at 1:100 with PBS. After an incubation for 1 h, the cells were rinsed with PBS

155

and incubated with goat anti-human Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen). After washing with PBS,

156

staining was observed under a fluorescence microscope.

157

Results

164

Production and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 Sfullpv and St19pv

165

SARS-CoV-2 Sfullpv, St19pv, and VSVpv were generated in 293T cells transiently expressed with

166

full length-, truncated S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and VSV-G, respectively, upon infection of 293T

167

cells with *G-VSV∆G/Luc, as previously reported (11). To confirm the incorporation of S proteins

168

into Sfullpv or St19pv particles, the pseudotyped viruses were purified by ultracentrifugation and

169

analyzed using immunoblotting and the serum of COVID-19 hospitalized patient (Fig. 1A, right

170

panel). The S1 and S2 proteins in Sfullpv or St19pv and Sfull- or St19-expressing cell lysates were

171

detected but not in VSV that lacked an envelope protein (∆Gpv) or mock cells (Ctrl). The VSV

172

structural proteins, nucleoprotein (N), and matrix protein (M) were also detected in Sfullpv, St19pv,

173

and ∆Gpv by CBB staining (Fig. 1A, left panel). Overall, the amount of St19 proteins incorporated

174

was higher than that of Sfull proteins, although the amount of structural proteins of VSV was

175

almost the same level among all the virions. These results indicate that the incorporation of

176

truncated S proteins into VSV particles was more efficient than the full-length S protein.

177

Next, ∆Gpv, Sfullpv, St19pv, and VSVpv were inoculated into the indicated cell lines to examine

178

the infectivity of pseudotyped viruses to various mammalian cell lines (Fig. 1B). Among the tested

179

cell lines, Huh7, 293T, Vero, and BHK cells were susceptible to Sfullpv and St19pv infection.

180

NIH3T3 cells were less susceptible to infection by both Sfullpv and St19pv, while CHO cells

181

showed no susceptibility. Notably, the infectivity of St19pv was higher than that of Sfullpv in Vero

182

cells.

183

To determine the specificity of infection of Sfullpv and St19pv, a neutralization assay of the

184

pseudotyped viruses was performed using sera of two hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The
8

185

infectivity of Sfullpv and St19pv, but not that of VSVpv in Vero cells, were clearly inhibited by

186

sera of the patients in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). These data indicated that Sfullpv and

187

St19pv infection exhibited an S protein-mediated entry.

188
189

Neutralization test for COVID-19 hospitalized patients or COVID-19 PCR-negative donors

190

by pseudotyped viruses

191

To examine the neutralization of COVID-19 hospitalized patients or COVID-19 PCR-negative

192

donors against St19pv, Vero cells with each serum were infected with St19pv and VSVpv.

193

Neutralization of St19pv was observed based on the sixteen sera of COVID-19 hospitalized patients

194

at a rate of more than 99% (Fig. 3A). Sera, which did not show the neutralization of St19pv, were

195

derived from COVID-19 hospitalized patients who were hospitalized for a short period before

196

antibody production (such as within 3 days after onset). No neutralization was observed in the

197

VSVpv infection by any of the sera of COVID-19 hospitalized patients and in both St19pv and

198

VSVpv infection by any of the sera of COVID-19 PCR-negative donors (Fig. 3A and B). The dot

199

plot graph shows a classification of each pseudotyped virus from Fig. 3A and 3B graphs (Fig. 3C).

200

Due to the presence of convalescent and non-convalescent patient sera, the degree of neutralization

201

activity of St19pv by COVID-19 hospitalized patient sera was variable.

202
203

IFA for COVID-19 hospitalized patients or COVID-19 PCR-negative donors

204

To examine the correlation of the antibody titers using CRNT compared to those determined by the

205

IFA, the IFA was also performed using COVID-19 hospitalized patients or COVID-19

206

PCR-negative donors. The fluorescence intensity of IFA was correlated with the sera, which exhibit

207

a high neutralizing activity in the CRNT (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Sera with low neutralizing activity in

9

208

the CRNT showed weak fluorescence intensity, and sera that demonstrated no neutralizing activity

209

in the CRNT were also negative by IFA.

210
211

Comparison of patient sera and whole blood in the neutralization of pseudotyped viruses

212

Also, we compared the neutralizing effect of pseudotyped viruses between the sera and whole blood

213

of COVID-19 hospitalized patients with or without centrifugation (Fig. 4). After centrifugation of

214

whole blood, hematopoietic cells, including red blood cells, may be removed. As a result, the

215

neutralization of both sera and whole blood against St19pv infection was observed with or without

216

centrifugation (Fig. 4). Although the neutralizing activities of whole blood were higher than those

217

of the sera in St19pv infection, the infectivity of VSVpv was reduced by approximately 1/10

218

without centrifugation (Fig. 4A). The reduction of infectivity of both St19pv and VSVpv was

219

suppressed, by removing hematopoietic cells in whole blood after centrifugation (Fig. 4B).

220

Therefore, some inhibitory factors, such as hematopoietic cells, may be involved in pseudotyped

221

virus infection in whole blood.

222
223
224

Discussion

225

A rapid, safe, and highly sensitive CRNT system using VSV-based pseudotyped viruses with

226

SARS-CoV-2 S or truncated S proteins was developed. Because this system utilizes replication and

227

translation of VSV, neutralization against pseudotyped virus infection can be determined within 12–

228

16 hours. Another pseudotyped viral system that uses retroviral or lentiviral vectors takes

229

approximately 48 h to obtain results. Therefore, the VSV-based pseudotyped viral system is

230

considered more useful. In addition, since measurement of luciferase activity is a quantitative

10

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.21.262295; this version posted August 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

231

method, it is not necessary to count GFP-positive cells. Therefore, this CRNT system permits a

232

simple and objective evaluation for the neutralization.

233

For many viral species, CRNT systems were developed using VSV-pseudotyped viruses with

234

their own envelope proteins (11, 13–15). In SARS-CoV-2, researchers recently demonstrated the

235

construction of pseudotyped viruses and evaluation of the presence of neutralizing antibodies (16).

236

In this study, we prepared a pseudotyped virus that possesses a truncated SARS-CoV-2 S

237

protein, which showed higher infectivity. Furthermore, the neutralizing activity of the test sera and

238

whole blood against the pseudotyped virus was quantitatively detected in a convalescent patient

239

with COVID-19, while the donor sera of the COVID-19 PCR-negative patient showed a negative

240

reaction. In the CRNT of St19pv, the infectivity of St19pv was reduced by 99% or more by the

241

convalescent phase patient sera. This demonstrated that the convalescent phase patient sera of

242

COVID-19 exhibited a high neutralizing antibody activity. The results determined by the CRNT

243

also correlated with those determined by the IFA. Antibodies against the S protein of SARS-CoV-2

244

in COVID-19 convalescent patient sera were capable of neutralizing the viral infection.

245

If using whole blood in the CRNT becomes possible, the work of separating serum will no

246

longer be necessary. The CRNT can be performed with an extremely small amount of blood sample

247

(only a few microliters). Therefore, when we confirmed that the CRNT with whole blood of the

248

convalescent phase patient of COVID-19 was possible, a high neutralizing activity by the CRNT

249

should be observed. However, the infectivity of the control VSVpv was also reduced by the whole

250

blood control. Since many hematopoietic cells, including red blood cells, are contained in whole

251

blood, these cells are present on the Vero cells used in the CRNT with whole blood. The possibility

252

highly exists that this inhibition is due to the presence of hematopoietic cells because removal of the

253

cells with centrifugation suppressed non-specific reduction of the pseudotyped viral infection.

254

However, inhibition of St19pv infection shows a stronger neutralizing activity compared to VSVpv

255

infection. Therefore, evaluating the CRNT using whole blood is possible.

256

The neutralizing antibody measurement system using pseudotyped viruses for SARS-CoV-2 is

257

an effective tool for evaluating the presence or duration of the neutralizing antibody in convalescent

258

patients and to screen for those who present with the neutralizing antibody among suspected

259

populations. In addition, this CRNT system does not require the use of infectious viruses to measure

260

neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, once the pseudotyped virus system is established, it can be made

261

available at many laboratories without BSL-3 facilities. Furthermore, because of the measuring

262

system by chemiluminescence, the results can be obtained safely and quickly. Finally, the CRNT

263

using whole blood is a simpler and safer method because it can be measured with only a very small

264

amount of blood from an eligible person.

using the pseudotyped viruses. Sfullpv, St19pv, and 100-fold-diluted VSVpv generated in 293T

330

cells were inoculated into the indicated cell lines. At 24 h post-infection, infectivity of the viruses

331

was determined by measuring luciferase activities as a relative luciferase unit (RLU). VSVpv

332

without envelope (∆Gpv) was used as a negative control. The results are from three independent
