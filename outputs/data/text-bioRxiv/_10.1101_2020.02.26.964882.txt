SUMMARY

31

A new coronavirus (CoV) identified as COVID-19 virus is the etiological agent responsible

32

for the 2019-2020 viral pneumonia outbreak that commenced in Wuhan1-4. Currently there

33

is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to

34

rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined

35

structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to

36

identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (Mpro). Mpro is a key

37

CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription,

38

making it an attractive drug target for this virus5,6. Here, we identified a mechanism-based

39

inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal

40

structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with this compound. Next, through a

41

combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over

42

10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other

43

pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these inhibit Mpro with

44

IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 μM. Ebselen also exhibited promising antiviral

45

activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy,

46

which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to

47

new infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available.

49

CoVs infect humans and other animal species, causing a variety of highly prevalent and

50

severe diseases, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East

51

Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)7. The COVID-19 virus genome is comprised of ~30,000

52

nucleotides; its replicase gene encodes two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab,

53

required for viral replication and transcription3,4. The functional polypeptides are released

54

from the polyproteins by extensive proteolytic processing, predominantly by a 33.8-kDa

55

main protease (Mpro), also referred to as the 3C-like protease. Mpro digests the polyprotein

56

at no less than 11 conserved sites, starting with the autolytic cleavage of this enzyme itself

57

from pp1a and pp1ab8. The functional importance of Mpro in the viral life cycle, together

58

with the absence of closely related homologues in humans, identify the Mpro as an attractive

59

target for antiviral drug design9.

60

To facilitate the rapid discovery of antiviral compounds with clinical potential, we

61

developed a strategy combining structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and

62

high-throughput screening to repurpose existing drugs to target COVID-19 virus Mpro.

63

Establishing a high-throughput activity assay

64

Recombinant COVID-19 virus Mpro with native N and C termini was expressed in

65

Escherichia coli and subsequently purified (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). The molecular

66

weight of COVID-19 virus Mpro as determined by mass spectroscopy is 33797.0 Da,

67

consistent with its theoretical molecular weight 33796.8 Da. In order to characterize its

68

enzymatic activity and to carry out high-throughput screening of inhibitors, we developed

69

a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. To do this, a fluorescently labeled

70

substrate, MCA-AVLQ↓SGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2, derived from the N-terminal auto-

71

cleavage sequence of the viral protease was designed and synthesized for time-dependent

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; this version posted March 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

72

kinetic analysis (Extended Data Fig. 1e). The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for COVID-19

73

virus Mpro was measured to be 28,500 M−1s−1 which is slightly higher than that for SARS-

74

CoV Mpro (kcat/Km=26,500 M−1s−1)10, but over 30-fold higher than that of human rhinovirus

75

3C protease (kcat/Km=920 M−1s−1)11.

76

N3 is a potent irreversible inhibitor of COVID-19 virus Mpro

77

In a previous study, we designed a Michael acceptor inhibitor N3 using computer-aided

78

drug design (CADD) (Extended Data Fig. 1c), which can specifically inhibit multiple CoV

79

Mpros, including those from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV12-15. It also has displayed potent

80

antiviral activity against infectious bronchitis virus in an animal model13. The CC50 of N3

81

is >133 μM (Extended Data Fig. 1f). Next, we constructed a homology model for COVID-

82

19 virus Mpro and used molecular docking to see if N3 could target this new CoV Mpro. A

83

docking pose showed that it could fit inside the substrate-binding pocket. To assess the

84

efficacy of N3 for COVID-19 virus Mpro, kinetic analysis was performed. A progress curve

85

showed that it is a time-dependent irreversible inhibitor of this enzyme. Further, the shape

86

of this curve supports the mechanism of two-step irreversible inactivation. The inhibitor

87

first associates with COVID-19 virus Mpro (EI) with a dissociation constant Ki; then, a

88

stable covalent bond is formed between N3 and Mpro (E−I). The evaluation of this time-

89

dependent inhibition requires both the equilibrium-binding constant Ki (designated as k2/k1)

90

and the inactivation rate constant for covalent bond formation k3. However, N3 exhibits

91

very potent inhibition of COVID-19 virus Mpro, such that measurement of Ki and k3 proved

92

not feasible (Extended Data Fig. 1d, e). When very rapid inactivation occurs, kobs/[I] was

93

utilized to evaluate the inhibition as an approximation of the pseudo second-order rate

94

constant (k3/Ki)12. The value of kobs/[I] of N3 for COVID-19 virus Mpro was determined to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; this version posted March 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

95

be 11,300±880 M-1s-1, suggesting this Michael acceptor has potent inhibition.

96

The crystal structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with N3

97

In order to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of this compound, we determined the crystal

98

structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with N3 to 2.1-Å resolution. The asymmetric

99

unit contains only one polypeptide (Extended Data Table 1). However, two of these

100

associate to form a dimer by a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis (the two molecules

101

are designated protomer A and B) (Fig. 1b). All residues (residues 1–306) are visible in

102

electron density maps. Each protomer is composed of three domains (Fig. 1a). Domains Ⅰ

103

(residues 8–101) and Ⅱ (residues 102–184) have an antiparallel β-barrel structure. Domain

104

Ⅲ (residues 201–303) contains five α-helices arranged into a largely antiparallel globular

105

cluster, and is connected to domain Ⅱ by means of a long loop region (residues 185–200).

106

COVID-19 virus Mpro has a Cys–His catalytic dyad, and the substrate-binding site is

107

located in a cleft between Domain Ⅰ and Ⅱ. These features are similar to those of other Mpros

108

reported previously5,6,13-15. The electron density map shows that N3 binds in the substrate-

109

binding pocket in an extended conformation (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 2), with the

110

inhibitor backbone atoms forming an antiparallel sheet with residues 164–168 of the long

111

strand155-168 on one side, and with residues 189–191 of the loop linking domains Ⅱ and Ⅲ.

112

Here we detail the specific interactions of N3 with Mpro (Fig. 1c, d). The electron density

113

shows that the Sγ atom of C145-A forms a covalent bond (1.8-Å) with the Cβ of the vinyl

114

group, confirming that the Michael addition has occurred. The S1 subsite has an absolute

115

requirement for Gln at the P1 position. The side chains of F140-A, N142-A, E166-A, H163-

116

A, H172-A, S1-B (from protomer B), and main chains of F140-A and L141-A are involved

117

in S1 subsite formation, which also includes two ordered water molecules (named W1 and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; this version posted March 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

118

W2). The lactam at P1 inserts into the S1 subsite and forms a hydrogen bond with H163-

119

A. The side chain of Leu at P2 site inserts deeply into the hydrophobic S2 subsite, which

120

consists of the side chains of H41-A, M49-A, Y54-A, M165-A, and the alkyl portion of the

121

side chain of D187-A. The side chain of Val at P3 is solvent-exposed, indicating that this

122

site can tolerate a wide range of functional groups. The side chain of Ala at P4 side is

123

surrounded by the side chains of M165-A, L167-A, F185-A, Q192-A and the main chain

124

of Q189-A, all of which form a small hydrophobic pocket. P5 makes van der Waals contacts

125

with P168-A and the backbone of residues 190–191. The bulky benzyl group extends into

126

the S1′ site, forming van der Waals interactions with T24-A and T25-A. In addition, N3

127

forms multiple hydrogen bonds with the main chain of the residues in the substrate-binding

128

pocket, which also helps lock the inhibitor inside the substrate-binding pocket.

129

An overlay of the structures of COVID-19 virus Mpro-N3 and SARS-CoV Mpro-N112

130

shows that N3 and N1 bind to Mpros in a similar mode (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 3). The

131

major difference lies in the P1´ site. Compared with the benzyl ester portion of N3 in the

132

COVID-19 virus Mpro structure, the ethyl ester portion in N1 adopts a slightly different

133

conformation. This may be attributed to an ordered water (W1) in SARS-CoV Mpro-N1

134

structure, which makes a long-distance hydrogen bond to the carboxylate oxygen of the

135

ester and also forms two hydrogen bonds from the backbone NH of G143 and the side

136

chain of N142. In our previous study, we proposed that all the CoV Mpros share a highly

137

conserved substrate-recognition pocket, which could serve as a drug target for the design

138

of broad-spectrum inhibitors12. The recent discovery of new CoVs and accumulation of

139

structural data for CoV Mpros from various species provided the opportunity to further

140

examine this hypothesis. Superposition of the 12 crystal structures of Mpros12-21 have shown

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; this version posted March 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

141

that the most variable regions were the helical domain Ⅲ and surface loops, but the

142

substrate-binding pockets located in a cleft between domains Ⅰ and Ⅱ are still highly

143

conserved among all CoV Mpros, suggesting the antiviral inhibitors targeting this site should

144

have wide-spectrum anti-CoV activity (Fig. 2b, c).

145

Virtual screening

146

The structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with N3 provides a model for identifying

147

lead inhibitors to target COVID-19 virus Mpro through in silico screening. To achieve this,

148

an in-house database of potential binding compounds was docked using Glide (v8.2). The

149

results show that cinanserin fits snugly into the substrate-binding pocket, by interacting

150

with H41 and E166 of Mpro by cation-π. Subsequently we determined this compound has

151

an IC50 value of 125 μM for Mpro. Moreover, cinanserin is a well-characterized serotonin

152

antagonist, which underwent preliminary clinical testing in humans in the 1960s22 and has

153

previously been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV Mpro23. The CC50 of cinanserin is > 200 μM

154

(Extended Data Fig. 4). Thus, it has potential for optimization as an anti-viral drug lead.

155

High-throughput screening

156

Next, we used our FRET assay, to screen a library of ~10,000 compounds consisting of

157

approved drugs, clinical trial drug candidates and natural products. Primary hits included

158

seven compounds that are either FDA-approved drugs or clinical trial/preclinical drug

159

candidates. We then determined their IC50 values, which are in the range from 0.67 to 21.4

160

μM (Fig. 3). Amongst them, disulfiram and carmofur are FDA-approved drugs, whilst

161

ebselen, shikonin, tideglusib, PX-12 and TDZD-8 are currently in clinical trials or

162

preclinical studies. Ebselen has the strongest inhibition of Mpro activity with an IC50 of 0.67

163

μM. However, in a detergent-based assay24, TDZD-8 was found to be an aggregate-based

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; this version posted March 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

164

inhibitor, which might non-specifically inhibit Mpro (Extended Data Fig. 5) and was

165

therefore not considered for further investigation. Next, we set out to identify the potential

166

covalent inhibitors among these compounds through tandem MS/MS analysis. The MS/MS

167

data shows that ebselen, PX-12 and carmofur are all able to covalently bind to C145 of the

168

catalytic dyad in COVID-19 virus Mpro. However, while PX-12 and carmofur completely

169

modified Mpro, ebselen could only partially modify this viral cysteine protease (Extended

170

Data Fig. 6). Since ebselen has even stronger inhibition than the others, there is a possibility

171

that ebselen could also inhibit Mpro through non-covalent binding. It is likely that a portion

172

of the hits identified by screening are covalently bonded to the catalytic cysteine of Mpro

173

through their sulfhydryl groups. In general, such molecules are expected to be promiscuous

174

binders and therefore, as they stand, may have limited potential as drug leads. Since our

175

structural data is based on N3, we investigated if molecular docking could predict how

176

disulfiram, tideglusib and shikonin bind to this protein. In all cases, reasonable docking

177

poses were found, demonstrating that they could fit inside the substrate-binding pocket

178

(Extended Data Fig. 7).

179

Antiviral activity assay

180

To further substantiate the enzymatic inhibition results in vitro, we evaluated whether these

181

compounds could prevent viral replication in cell-based assays. As shown in Fig. 4a,

182

quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that ebselen and N3 showed the

183

strongest antiviral effects among them at a concentration of 10 μM treatment in COVID-

184

19 virus infected Vero cells. A plaque-reduction assay (Extended Data Fig. 8) was

185

performed to further assess the efficacy of these two compounds in protecting cells.

186

Ebselen and N3 displayed inhibition against COVID-19 virus with individual EC50 values

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; this version posted March 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

187

of 4.67 μM and 16.77 μM, respectively (Fig. 4b, c). The dose-response curves suggest that

188

both of them could be able to penetrate cellular membrane to access their targets. Ebselen

189

is an organoselenium compound with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and cytoprotective

190

properties. This compound has been investigated for the treatment of multiple diseases,

191

such as bipolar disorders25 and hearing loss26,27. Ebselen has extremely low cytotoxicity

192

(LD50 in rats > 4,600 mg/kg, per os)28 and its safety in humans has been evaluated in a

193

number of clinical trials26,27,29. These data strongly suggest the clinical potential of ebselen

194

for CoV treatment. It is also interesting that cinanserin displayed moderate inhibition

195

against COVID-19 virus with an EC50 value of 20.61 μM from qRT-PCR analysis

196

(Extended Data Fig. 4), which is superior to that in the enzymatic inhibition assay,

197

suggesting that cinanserin might have multi-drug targets in preventing viral infection. In

198

further studies, selection and characterization of drug-resistant mutants will help clarify the

199

mode of cinanserin’s action.

200

Discussion

201

Our crystal structural and docking data have shown that the drug leads identified can bind

202

to the substrate-binding pocket of COVID-19 virus Mpro, which is highly conserved among

203

all CoV Mpros. This strongly supports our hypothesis that development of a single antiviral

204

agent targeting Mpro or in combination with other potential therapies could provide an

205

effective first line of defense against all CoV-associated diseases.

206

In the last twenty years, new infectious agents have emerged to cause epidemics, such

207

as SARS and MERS7. The timely development of effective antiviral agents for clinical use

208

is extremely challenging because conventional drug development approaches normally

209

take years of investigations and cost billions of dollars. The repurposing of approved

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; this version posted March 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

210

pharmaceutical drugs and drug candidates provides an alternative approach to rapidly

211

identify potential drug leads to manage rapidly emerging viral infections. Cell-based

212

phenotypic screening has proven to be valuable30, but the complexity of this approach is

213

not readily compatible with high-throughput pipelines, and it cannot identify the molecular

214

target or mechanism of action31. In this study, the convergence of structure-based ab initio

215

drug design, virtual screening and high-throughput screening proved to be an efficient

216

strategy to find antiviral leads against COVID-19 virus. The methods presented here can

217

greatly assist in the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new

218

emerging infectious diseases that currently lack specific drugs and vaccines.

Methods

333

Cloning, protein expression and purification of COVID-19 virus Mpro

334

The full-length gene encoding COVID-19 virus Mpro (NC_045512) was optimized and

335

synthesized for Escherichia coli expression (Genewiz, USA). Cloning strategy for

336

producing authentic viral Mpro has been reported previously10. The expression plasmid was

337

transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and then cultured in Luria Broth

338

medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. When the cells were grown to OD600 of

339

0.6-0.8, 0.5 mM IPTG was added to the cell culture to induce the expression at 16 °C. After

340

10 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000g. The cell pellets were

341

resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl), lysed by high-

342

pressure homogenization, and then centrifuged at 25,000g for 40 min. The supernatant was

343

loaded onto Ni-NTA affinity column (Qiagen, Germany), and washed by the resuspension

344

buffer containing 20 mM imidazole. The His tagged Mpro was eluted by cleavage buffer

345

(50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl) including 300 mM imidazole. Human rhinovirus

346

3C protease was added to remove the C-terminal His tag. The Mpro was further purified by

347

ion exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. CoV Mpros exist as a

348

mixture of monomers and dimers in solutions32. The purified Mpro was stored in 50 mM

349

Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 1 mM EDTA.

350

Crystallization, data collection and structure determination

351

COVID-19 virus Mpro was incubated with 10 mM N3 for 30 min and the complex (5 mg/ml)

352

was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C. The best crystals were

353

grown with well buffer containing 0.1 M MES pH 6.0, 2% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000,

354

3% DMSO, 1 mM DTT. The cryo-protectant solution contained 0.1 M MES pH 6.0, 30%

355

PEG 400.

356

X-ray data were collected on beamline BL17U1 at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation

357

Facility (SSRF) at 100 K and at a wavelength of 1.07180 Å using an Eiger X 16M image

358

plate detector. Data integration and scaling were performed using the program Xia233. The

359

structure was determined by molecular replacement (MR) with the Phaser module34 in

360

CCP435 using the SARS-CoV Mpro (PDB ID: 2H2Z) as a search template. The output model

361

from MR was subsequently subjected to iterative cycles of manual model adjustment with

362

Coot36 and refinement was finished with Phenix37. The inhibitor N3 was built according to

363

the omit map. The phasing and refinement statistics are summarized in Extended Data

364

Table 1. The Rwork/Rfree values are 0.202/0.235, respectively. 97.3% residues are in most

365

favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, and no residues are found in disallowed regions.

366

Coordinates and structure factors for COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with the inhibitor

367

N3 have been deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession number 6LU7. While

368

this work was under review, we solved the complex structure at a higher resolution (1.7 Å).

369

The relevant coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in PDB with accession

370

number 7BQY.

371

Enzymatic activity and inhibition assays

372

The enzyme activity assays have been described previously10. Briefly, the activity of

373

COVID-19 virus Mpro was measured by a continuous kinetic assay, with the substrate

374

MCA-AVLQSGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2 (GL Biochem, Shanghai), using wavelengths of

375

320 nm and 405 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. The assay started by

376

immediately mixing 0.2 μM COVID-19 virus Mpro with different concentrations of

377

substrate (2.5-100 μM). Fluorescence intensity was monitored with an EnVision multimode

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; this version posted March 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

378

plate reader (Perkin Elmer, USA). Initial rates were obtained by fitting the linear portion

379

of the curves to a straight line. The kinetic parameters Km and kcat were calculated from a

380

double-reciprocal plot. As N3 is a mechanism-based irreversible inhibitor for COVID-19

381

virus Mpro, kobs/[I] was used as an approximation of the pseudo second-order rate constant

382

to evaluate the inhibition effect of the inhibitor N312. In this case, the measurement was

383

carried out with 0.2 μM of enzyme, 20 μM of substrate and inhibitor at 6 different

384

concentrations (0-1 μM).

385

Virtual screening

386

The virtual screening was performed using our in-house database via a workflow

387

application of Glide (v8.2), Maestro (Schrödinger 2019-1a)38. All compounds in the

388

database were considered to be at pH 7.4 ± 0.2 to estimate their protonation state using the

389

program EpiK39. Their three dimensional conformations were generated by the ligPrep

390

module of Maestro. The structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) was used to

391

generate receptor grid for docking simulations. The center of active site of the grid was

392

determined according to the position of N3 in the structure. The flexibility of the receptor

393

hydroxyl and thiol groups in side chains of C145, S46 and Y54 were considered. At the

394

very beginning, a relatively fast but raw screening was performed by using the glide

395

standard precision model, and the top 20% of compounds were kept. Finally, the candidate

396

molecules were picked by analysing the predicted binding modes and their scores.

397

High-throughput drug screen and IC50 measurement

398

Potential inhibitors against COVID-19 virus Mpro were screened by an enzymatic inhibition

399

assay. When the different compounds were added into the enzymatic reaction mixture, the

400

change of initial rates was calculated to evaluate their inhibitory effect. Five drug libraries,

401

Approved Drug Library (Target Mol, USA), Clinic Compound Library (Target Mol, USA),

402

FDA-approved Drug Library (Selleck, USA), Natural Product Library (Selleck, USA), and

403

Anti-virus Drug Library (Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies,

404

SIAIS), which includes ~10,000 compounds, were used. The preliminary screening

405

reaction mixture included 0.2 μM protein, 20 μM substrate and 50 μM compounds. The

406

compounds of interest were defined as those with a percentage of inhibition over 60%

407

compared with the reaction in the absence of inhibitor. IC50 values of seven drug leads were

408

measured using 0.2 μM protein, 20 μM substrate and 11 different inhibitor concentrations.

409

In order to exclude inhibitors possibly acting as aggregators, detergent-based control was

410

performed by adding 0.001% or 0.01% freshly made up Triton X-100 to the reaction at the

411

same time24. All experimental data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism. All experiments

412

were performed in triplicate.

413

Molecular docking

414

To understand the binding interaction of these molecules with COVID-19 virus Mpro, two

415

different molecular docking methods, i.e., Glide (v8.2)38 and iFitDock40 were used to

416

predict their binding poses. Then a 3D molecular similarity calculation method, SHAFTS41,

417

was used for molecular alignment poses enumeration by matching the critical

418

pharmacophore and volumetric overlay between the N3 molecule within the Mpro structure

419

and the six drug candidates. However, the selenium atom of ebselen could not be treated

420

by any of these above methods, so sulfur was used to replace it in the calculations. Then

421

the obtained optimal superposition of these molecules was used to assess the reasonability

422

of the predicted binding poses from the two docking methods, and only the binding

423

orientations which were consistent among different methods were kept for constructing the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; this version posted March 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

424

initial complexes. Finally, these complexes were further optimized and re-scored by using

425

MM-GBSA module42 of Schrödinger, and the residues within 5 Å around the ligand were

426

refined.

427

Antiviral and cytotoxicity assays for compounds from high-throughput screening

428

The in vitro antiviral efficacy of the drug candidates on Vero cells were determined by qRT-

429

PCR. About 1×104 Vero cells were seeded into a 96-well plate and incubated for 20-24 h

430

at 37 °C. All the infection experiments were performed at biosafety level-3 (BSL-3). Cells

431

were pre-treated with the drug candidates (10 μM) for 1 h; the COVID-19 virus (MOI of

432

0.01) was subsequently added to allow infection for 2 h. Then, the virus-drug mixture was

433

removed and cells were further cultured with fresh drug-containing medium. At 72 h post

434

infection (p.i.), viral RNA (vRNA) was extracted from the culture supernatant using

435

QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s

436

recommendation and detected by qRT-PCR assay using the COVID-19 virus-specific

437

primers. Because shikonin showed cellular toxicity at the test concentration, its antiviral

438

activity assay did not further proceed. Viral RNA copies per milliliter were determined

439

using a synthetic RNA fragment to amplify the target region. The linearized plasmid

440

containing S gene of COVID-19 virus was subjected to in vitro transcription. The resulting

441

RNA transcripts were purified and then quantified using spectrophotometry on Nanodrop

442

2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The purified RNA was diluted 10-fold serially

443

using RNase-free water and was detected using qRT-PCR. Threshold cycle (Ct) values for

444

the known concentrations of the RNA were plotted against the log of the number of genome

445

equivalent copies. The resultant standard curve was used to determine the number of

446

genome equivalents of vRNA in the samples. The determination of the detection limit was

447

based on the lowest level at which vRNA was detected and remained within the range of

448

linearity of a standard curve (Ct value of 38). TaqMan primers for COVID-19 virus are 5'-

449

TCCTGGTGATTCTTCTTCAGG-3' and 5'-TCTGAGAGAGGGTCAAGTGC-3' with

450

COVID-19 virus probe 5'-FAM-AGCTGCAGCACCAGCTGTCCA-BHQ1-3'. The

451

cytotoxicity of the tested drugs on Vero cell were determined by MTS cell proliferation

452

assays (Promega, USA). 1×104 cells were seeded into a 96-well plate and incubated for 20-

453

24 h at 37 °C. After that, the medium was removed, and 100 µl of medium containing

454

decreasing concentrations of antiviral compounds were added to the wells. After 4 days

455

incubation at 37 °C, MTS assays were performed according to manufacturer’s protocols.

456

All experiments were performed in triplicate. Vero cells were obtained from ATCC

457

（American Type Culture Collection）with authentication service. All cell lines were tested

458

negative for mycoplasma contamination. No commonly misidentified cell lines were used.

459

Antiviral and cytotoxicity assays for cinanserin

460

For the antiviral assay, a clinical isolate COVID-19 virus3 was propagated in Vero E6 cells,

461

and viral titer was determined as described previously43. All the infection experiments were

462

performed at BSL-3. Pre-seeded Vero E6 cells (5×104 cells/well) were pre-treated with the

463

different concentrations of cinanserin for 1 h and the virus was subsequently added (MOI

464

of 0.05) to allow infection for 2 h. Then, the virus-drug mixture was removed and cells

465

were further cultured with fresh drug containing medium. At 24 h p.i., the cell supernatant

466

was collected and vRNA in supernatant was subjected to qRT-PCR analysis. For

467

cytotoxicity assays, Vero E6 cells were suspended in growth medium in 96-well plates. The

468

next day, appropriate concentrations of cinanserin were added to the medium. After 24 h,

469

the relative numbers of surviving cells were measured by CCK8 (Beyotime, China) assay

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; this version posted March 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

470

in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. All experiments were performed in

471

triplicate. Vero E6 cells were obtained from ATCC with authentication service. All cell lines

472

were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. No commonly misidentified cell lines

473

were used.

474

Plaque-reduction assays

475

1×105 Vero E6 cells were seeded in a 24-well plate and treated with different doses of the

476

inhibitors. All the infection experiments were performed at BSL-3. Inhibitors with different

477

dilution concentrations were mixed with COVID-19 virus (100 PFU), 200 μl mixtures were

478

inoculated onto monolayer Vero E6 cells for 1 h. After removing the supernatant, the plate

479

was washed twice with DMEM medium, cells were incubated with 0.9% agarose

480

containing appropriate concentrations of inhibitors. The overlay was discarded at 4 days

481

p.i. and cells were fixed for 30 min in 4% polyoxymethylene and stained with crystal violet

482

working solution. The plaque forming units were determined. All experiments were

483

performed in four biological replicates.

484

Intact protein analysis

485

2.5 μl of compounds (10 mM in DMSO) were added into 50 μl of COVID-19 virus Mpro

486

(10 mg/ml). The mixtures were kept in room temperature for 30 min. Liquid

487

chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses were performed in positive-ion

488

mode with a quadrupole-time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer (Agilent 6550, USA)

489

coupled with a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC, Agilent 1260, USA) for

490

detecting the molecular weight of intact proteins. The samples were eluted from a

491

Phenomenex Jupiter C4 300Å LC Column (2×150 mm, 5 μm) over a 15 min gradient from

492

5% to 100% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The

503

mass spectrometry analysis. The elution gradient and mobile phase constitution used for

504

peptide separation were as follows: 0-1 min, 4%-8% B; 1-96 min, 8-35% B; 96-104 min,

505

35-60% B; 105-120min, 60-100% B (mobile phase A: 0.1% formic acid in water; mobile

506

phase B: 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 300 nl /min. Peptides eluted

507

from the LC column were directly electro-sprayed into the mass spectrometer with the

508

application of a distal 1.8-kV spray voltage. Survey full-scan MS spectra (from m/z 300–

509

1800) were acquired in the Orbitrap analyzer (Q Exactive, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA)

510

with resolution r = 70,000 at m/z 400. The top 20 MS/MS events were sequentially

511

generated and selected from the full MS spectrum at a 30% normalized collision energy.

512

The dynamic exclusion time was set at 10 seconds. One acquisition cycle includes one full-

513

scan MS spectrum followed by top 20 MS/MS events, sequentially generated on the first
