Abstract

29

A coronavirus identified as 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is the etiological agent

30

responsible for the 2019-2020 viral pneumonia outbreak that commenced in Wuhan1-4.

31

Currently there is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very

32

limited. In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program

33

of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening, and high-throughput

34

screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 main protease (Mpro). Mpro

35

is a key coronavirus enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and

36

transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus5,6. Here, we identified a

37

mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently

38

determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 Mpro in complex with this compound. Next,

39

through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we

40

assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical

41

trials, and other pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of Mpro. Seven of these

42

inhibit Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.48 to 16.62 μM. Ebselen, thiadiazolidinone-8

43

(TDZD-8) and N3 also exhibited strong antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results

44

demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, and establishes a new paradigm for the

45

rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases

46

where no specific drugs or vaccines are available.

48

An epidemic of contagious pneumonia has been spreading rapidly from its likely origin in

49

Central China since December 20191,2. The infectious pneumonia is now found in all

50

provinces of China, with cases also confirmed in other 35 countries. As of February 25,

51

2020, around 80,000 people were infected and over 2,500 have succumbed to the

52

epidemic7,8. Symptoms associated with this disease include fever, cough, myalgia or

53

fatigue and dyspnea9,10. The World Health Organization announced that the outbreak of this

54

deadly and fast-spreading infectious pneumonia constitutes a global health emergency8. A

55

coronavirus named 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), has been identified as the

56

etiological agent responsible for the outbreak3,4. At present, there are no targeted

57

therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited.

58

CoVs infect humans and other animal species, causing a variety of highly prevalent and

59

severe diseases, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East

60

Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)11. CoVs are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses

61

featuring the largest viral RNA genomes known to date12. The COVID-19 genome is

62

comprised of ~30,000 nucleotides; its replicase gene encodes two overlapping polyproteins,

63

pp1a and pp1ab, required for viral replication and transcription3,4. The functional

64

polypeptides are released from the polyproteins by extensive proteolytic processing,

65

predominantly by a 33.8-kDa main protease (Mpro), also referred to as the 3C-like protease.

66

Mpro digests the polyprotein at no less than 11 conserved sites, starting with the autolytic

67

cleavage of this enzyme itself from pp1a and pp1ab5. The functional importance of Mpro in

68

the viral life cycle, together with the absence of closely related homologues in humans,

69

identify the Mpro as an attractive target for antiviral drug design6.

70

To facilitate the rapid discovery of antiviral compounds with clinical potential, we

71

developed a strategy combining structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and

72

high-throughput screening to repurpose existing drugs to target Mpro, which is a key

73

enzyme for the viral life cycle. Our strategy has successfully identified several new

74

compounds that showed both strong inhibition of the target enzyme and antiviral activity

75

in cell-based assays. These studies pave the way for the further development of novel

76

antiviral drugs against this CoV.

77

Establishing a high-throughput activity assay

78

Recombinant COVID-19 Mpro with native N and C termini was expressed in Escherichia

79

coli and subsequently purified (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). The molecular weight of

80

COVID-19 Mpro as determined by mass spectroscopy is 33797.0 Da, consistent with its

81

theoretical molecular weight 33796.8 Da. In order to characterize its enzymatic activity

82

and to carry out high throughput screening of inhibitors, we developed a fluorescence

83

resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. To do this, a fluorescently labeled substrate,

84

MCA-AVLQ↓SGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2, derived from the N-terminal auto-cleavage

85

sequence of the viral protease was designed and synthesized for time-dependent kinetic

86

analysis (Extended Data Fig. 1e). The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for COVID-19 Mpro was

87

measured to be 28,500 M−1s−1 which is slightly higher than that for SARS-CoV Mpro

88

(kcat/Km=26,500 M−1s−1)13, but over 30-fold higher than that of human rhinovirus 3C

89

protease (kcat/Km=920 M−1s−1)14.

90

N3 is a potent irreversible inhibitor of COVID-19 Mpro

91

In a previous study, we designed a Michael acceptor inhibitor N3 using computer-aided

92

drug design (CADD) (Extended Data Fig. 1c), which can specifically inhibit multiple CoV

93

Mpros, including those from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV15-18. It also has displayed potent

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; this version posted February 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this

94

antiviral activity against infectious bronchitis virus in an animal model16. Next, we

95

constructed a homology model for COVID-19 Mpro and used molecular docking to see if

96

N3 could target this new CoV Mpro. A docking pose showed that it could fit inside the

97

substrate-binding pocket. To assess the efficacy of N3 for COVID-19 Mpro , kinetic analysis

98

was performed15. A progress curve showed that it is time-dependent irreversible inhibitor

99

of this enzyme. Further, the shape of this curve supports the mechanism of two-step

100

irreversible inactivation. The inhibitor first associates with COVID-19 Mpro (EI) with a

101

dissociation constant Ki; then, a stable covalent bond is formed between N3 and Mpro (E−I).

102

The evaluation of this time-dependent inhibition requires both the equilibrium-binding

103

constant Ki (designated as k2/k1) and the inactivation rate constant for covalent bond

104

formation k3 (Extended Data Fig. 1d). However, N3 exhibits very potent inhibition of

105

COVID-19 Mpro (Extended Data Fig. 1e), such that measurement of Ki and k3 proved

106

difficult. When very rapid inactivation occurs, kobs/[I] was utilized to evaluate the inhibition

107

as an approximation of the pseudo second-order rate constant (k3/Ki)15. The value of kobs/[I]

108

of N3 for COVID-19 Mpro was determined to be 11,300±880 M-1s-1, suggesting this

109

Michael acceptor has potent inhibition.

110

The crystal structure of COVID-19 Mpro in complex with N3

111

In order to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of this compound, we determined the crystal

112

structure of COVID-19 Mpro in complex with N3 to 2.1-Å resolution. The asymmetric unit

113

contains only one polypeptide (Extended Data Table 1). However, two of these associate

114

to form a dimer by a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis (the two molecules are

115

designated protomer A and B) (Fig. 1b). All residues (residues 1–306) are visible in electron

116

density maps. Each protomer is composed of three domains (Fig. 1a). Domains I (residues

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; this version posted February 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this

117

8–101) and II (residues 102–184) have an antiparallel β-barrel structure. Domain III

118

(residues 201–303) contains five α-helices arranged into a largely antiparallel globular

119

cluster, and is connected to domain II by means of a long loop region (residues 185–200).

120

COVID-19 Mpro has a Cys–His catalytic dyad, and the substrate-binding site is located in

121

a cleft between Domain I and II. These features are similar to those of other Mpros reported

122

previously5,16,18-20. The electron density map shows that N3 binds in the substrate-binding

123

pocket in an extended conformation (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 2), with the inhibitor

124

backbone atoms forming an antiparallel sheet with residues 164–168 of the long strand155-

125

168

on one side, and with residues 189–191 of the loop linking domains II and III.

126

Here we detail the specific interactions of N3 with Mpro (Fig. 1c). The electron density

127

shows that the Sγ atom of C145-A forms a covalent bond (1.8-Å) with the Cβ of the vinyl

128

group, confirming that the Michael addition has occurred (Fig. 1c, d). The S1 subsite has

129

an absolute requirement for Gln at the P1 position. The side chains of F140-A, N142-A,

130

E166-A, H163-A, H172-A, S1-B (from protomer B), and main chains of F140-A and L141-

131

A are involved in S1 subsite formation, which also includes two ordered water molecules

132

(named W1 and W2). The lactam at P1 inserts into the S1 subsite and forms a hydrogen

133

bond with H163-A. The side chain of Leu at P2 site deeply inserts into the hydrophobic S2

134

subsite, which consists of the side chains of H41-A, M49-A, Y54-A, M165-A, and the alkyl

135

portion of the side chain of D187-A. The side chain of Val at P3 is solvent-exposed,

136

indicating that this site can tolerate a wide range of functional groups. The side chain of

137

Ala at P4 side is surrounded by the side chains of M165-A, L167-A, F185-A, Q192-A and

138

the main chain of Q189-A, all of which form a small hydrophobic pocket. P5 makes van

139

der Waals contacts with P168-A and the backbone of residues 190–191. The bulky benzyl

140

group extends into the S1′ site, possibly forming van der Waals interactions with T24-A

141

and T25-A. In addition, N3 forms multiple hydrogen bonds with the main chain of the

142

residues in the substrate-binding pocket, which also helps lock the inhibitor inside the

143

substrate-binding pocket (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 2).

144

Virtual screening

145

The structure of COVID-19 Mpro in complex with N3 provides a model for rapidly

146

identifying lead inhibitors to target COVID-19 Mpro through in silico screening. To achieve

147

this, an in-house database of potential binding compounds was docked using Glide (version

148

8.2) of Schrödinger 2019-1. The results show that cinanserin fits snugly into the substrate-

149

binding pocket, by interacting with H41 and E166 of Mpro by cation-π. Subsequently we

150

determined this compound has an IC50 value of 124.93 μM for Mpro, which validated our

151

virtual screening approach (Extended Data Fig. 3). Moreover, cinanserin is a well-

152

characterized serotonin antagonist, which has undergone preliminary clinical testing in

153

humans in the 1960s21 and has previously been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV Mpro 22. Thus,

154

it has potential for further optimization as an anti-viral drug lead.

155

High-throughput screening

156

Next, we used our FRET assay, to screen a library of ~10,000 compounds consisting of

157

approved drugs, clinical trial drug candidates and natural products. Primary hits included

158

seven compounds that are either FDA-approved drugs or clinical trial/preclinical drug

159

candidates. We then determined their IC50 values, which are in the range from 0.48 to 16.62

160

μM (Fig. 2). Amongst them, disulfiram and carmofur are FDA-approved drugs, whilst

161

ebselen, TDZD-8, shikonin, tideglusib, and PX-12 are currently in clinical trials or

162

preclinical studies. Ebselen has the strongest inhibition of Mpro activity with an IC50 of 0.48

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; this version posted February 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this

163

μM. Since our structural data is only for N3, we investigated if molecular docking could

164

predict how these inhibitors bind to this protein. In all cases, reasonable docking poses

165

were found, demonstrating that they could fit inside the substrate-binding pocket (Extended

166

Data Fig. 4).

167

Antiviral activity assay

168

To further substantiate the enzymatic inhibition results in vitro, we then evaluated the

169

ability of these compounds to prevent cells from being infected by COVID-19. As shown

170

in Fig. 3, ebselen, TDZD-8 and N3 showed the most potent antiviral effects at a

171

concentration of 10 μM, entirely preventing the cytopathic effect (CPE) in COVID-19-

172

infected Vero cells. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that treatment

173

of ebselen reduced the amounts of COVID-19 20.3-fold compared with the treatment in

174

the absence of inhibitor, and TDZD-8 and N3 exhibited 10.9-fold and 8.4-fold reduction in

175

COVID-19 growth, respectively. Ebselen is an organoselenium compound with anti-

176

inflammatory, anti-oxidant and cytoprotective properties. This compound has been

177

investigated for the treatment of multiple diseases, such as bipolar disorders and hearing

178

loss. The toxicity of ebselen in humans has been evaluated in a number of clinical trials23-

179

25

180

8 was originally designed as a lead compound for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease,

181

which has been shown to be effective in animal models26. It is also interesting that

182

cinanserin displayed moderate inhibition against COVID-19 with an IC50 value of 20.61

183

μM (Extended Data Fig. 3), which is superior to that in the enzymatic inhibition assay,

184

suggesting that cinanserin might have multi-drug targets in preventing viral infection.

. These data strongly suggest the clinical potential of ebselen for CoV treatment. TDZD-

Discussion

186

In the last twenty years, new infectious agents have emerged to cause epidemics, such as

187

SARS and MERS11. The timely development of effective antiviral agents for clinical use

188

is extremely challenging because conventional drug development approaches normally

189

take years of investigations and cost billions of dollars

190

pharmaceutical drugs and drug candidates provides an alternative approach to rapidly

191

identify potential drug leads to manage rapidly emerging viral infections28. Cell-based

192

phenotypic screening has proven to be valuable29, but the corresponding methodological

193

complexity is not readily compatible with high-throughput pipelines, and fails to inform

194

the identity of the molecular target or mechanism of action30. In this regard, we combined

195

structure-based ab initio drug design, virtual screening and high-throughput screening to

196

discover new drugs for treating COVID-19 infection. The convergence of these three

197

approaches proved to be an efficient strategy in finding three lead compounds with good

198

antiviral activity. Ebselen is of particular interest for further investigation since its safety

199

in humans has been supported by different clinical trials23-25. Our methodology establishes

200

a paradigm of rapid discovering drug leads with clinical potential in response to new

201

emerging infectious diseases lacking specific drugs and vaccines.

27

. The repurposing of approved

202

The crystal structural and docking data have shown that these drug leads can bind to the

203

substrate-binding pocket of COVID-19 Mpro. In our previous study, we proposed that all

204

the CoV Mpros share a highly conservative substrate-recognition pocket, which serves as a

205

drug target for broad-spectrum inhibitor design15. Recent discovery of new CoVs and

206

accumulation of structural data for CoV Mpros from various species provided the

207

opportunity to further examine our previous hypothesis. Superposition of the 12 crystal

208

structures of Mpros15,16,18,20,31-35 have shown that the most variable regions were the helical

209

domain III and surface loops, but the substrate-binding pockets located in a cleft between

210

domains I and II are still highly conserved among all CoV Mpros, suggesting the antiviral

211

inhibitors targeting at this site should have wide-spectrum anti-CoV activity (Fig. 4). This

212

strongly supports our hypothesis that development of a single antiviral agent could provide

213

an effective first line of defense against all CoV-associated diseases.

Methods

336

Cloning, protein expression and purification

337

The full-length gene encoding COVID-19 Mpro was optimized and synthesized for

338

Escherichia coli expression (GENEWIZ). Cloning strategy for producing authentic viral

339

Mpro has been reported previously13. The expression plasmid was transformed into

340

Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and then cultured in Luria broth (LB) media containing

341

100 μg/mL ampicillin at 37℃, 220 rpm. When the cells were grown to OD600 of 0.6-0.8,

342

0.5 mM IPTG was added to the cell culture to induce the expression of the recombinant

343

COVID-19 Mpro at 16℃, 180 rpm. After 10 hours, the cells were harvested by

344

centrifugation at 3,000×g for 20 min.

345

The cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl),

346

lysed by high-pressure homogenization, and then centrifuged at 25,000×g for 40 min. The

347

supernatant was loaded onto Ni-NTA affinity column (QIAGEN), and washed by the

348

resuspension buffer containing 20 mM imidazole. The His tagged Mpro was eluted by

349

cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl) including 300 mM imidazole.

350

Human rhinovirus 3C protease was added to remove the C-terminal His tag. The COVID-

351

19 Mpro was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography and size-exclusion

352

chromatography (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare). The purified COVID-19 Mpro was stored

353

in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mM EDTA.

354

Crystallization

355

COVID-19 Mpro was incubated with 10 mM N3 for 30 min and the complex (5 mg/ml) was

356

crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20°C. The best crystals were grown

357

with well buffer containing 2% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000, 3% DMSO, 1 mM DTT,

358

0.1 M MES (pH 6.0). The cryo-protectant solution contained 30% PEG 400, 0.1 M MES

359

(pH 6.0).

360

Data collection and structure determination

361

X-ray data were collected on beamline BL17U1 at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation

362

Facility (SSRF) at 100 K and at a wavelength of 1.07180 Å using an Eiger X 16M image

363

plate detector. Data integration and scaling were performed using the program Xia2. The

364

structure was determined by molecular replacement (MR) with the Phaser module36 in

365

CCP437 using the SARS-CoV Mpro (PDB ID: 2H2Z) as a search template. The output model

366

from MR was subsequently subjected to iterative cycles of manual model adjustment with

367

Coot38 and refinement was finished with Phenix39. The inhibitor N3 was built according to

368

the omit map. The phasing and refinement statistics are summarized in Extended Data

369

Table 1. The Rwork/Rfree values are 0.202/0.235, respectively. 97.3% residues are in most

370

favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, and no residues are found in disallowed regions.

371

Coordinates and structure factors for COVID-19 Mpro in complex with the inhibitor N3

372

have been deposited in Protein Data Bank with accession number 6LU7.

373

Enzymatic activity and inhibition assays

374

The enzyme activity assays have been described previously13. Briefly, the activity of

375

COVID-19 Mpro was measured by continuous kinetic assay, with the substrate MCA-

376

AVLQSGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2 (GL Biochem Shanghai Ltd), using wavelengths of 320

377

and 405 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. The assays started by immediately

378

mixing 0.2 μM COVID-19 Mpro with different concentrations of substrate (2.5-100 μM).

379

Fluorescence intensity was monitored with EnVision multimode plate reader

380

(PerkinElmer). Initial rates were obtained by fitting the linear portion of the curves (usually

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; this version posted February 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this

381

the first 3 min of the assay curves) to a straight line. The kinetic parameters Km and kcat

382

were calculated from a double-reciprocal plot. As N3 is a mechanism-based irreversible

383

inhibitor for COVID-19 Mpro, kobs/[I] was used as an approximation of the pseudo second-

384

order rate constant to evaluate the inhibition effect of the inhibitor N315. In this case, the

385

measurement was carried out with 0.2 μM of enzyme, 20 μM of substrate and inhibitor at

386

6 different concentrations (0-1 μM).

387

Virtual screening

388

The virtual screening was performed using our in-house database via a workflow

389

application of Glide (v8.2)40, which is a module of molecular simulation software package,

390

Maestro (Schrodinger 2019-1a). All compounds in the database were considered to be at

391

pH 7.4 ± 0.2 to estimate their protonation state using the program EpiK41. Their three

392

dimensional conformations were generated by the ligPrep module of Maestro. The newly

393

obtained complex structure of COVID-19 Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) was used to generate

394

receptor grid for docking simulations. The center of active site of the grid was determined

395

according to the N3 in the structure. The flexibility of the receptor hydroxyl and thiol

396

groups in side chains of C145, S46 and Y54 were considered. At the very beginning, a

397

relatively fast but raw screening was performed by using the glide standard precision model,

398

and the top 20% of compounds were kept. Then covalent docking simulations were

399

performed by choosing Michael Addition as the reaction type for these top 20% compounds

400

that contained Michael acceptors, and C145 was set as the source of Michael donor. Finally,

401

the candidate molecules were picked out by analysing the predicted binding modes and

402

their scores.

403

High-throughput drug screen and IC50 measurement

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; this version posted February 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this

404

Potential inhibitors against COVID-19 Mpro were screened by enzymatic inhibition assay.

405

When different compounds were added into the enzymatic reaction, the change of initial

406

rates was calculated to evaluate their inhibitory effect. Five drug libraries, Approved Drug

407

Library (TargetMol, USA), Clinic Compound Library (TargetMol, USA), FDA-approved

408

Drug Library (Selleck, USA), Natural Product Library (Selleck, USA), and Anti-virus drug

409

library (Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies, SIAIS), which includes

410

~ 10,000 compounds, were used. The preliminary screening reaction mixture included 0.2

411

μM protein, 20 μM substrate and 50 μM compounds. The compounds of interest were

412

defined as those with a percentage of inhibition over 60% compared with the reaction in

413

the absence of inhibitor. IC50 values were measured at 12 concentrations and three

414

independent experiments were performed. All experimental data was analyzed using

415

GraphPad Prism software.

416

Molecular docking

417

To understand the binding interaction of these molecules with COVID-19 Mpro, two

418

different molecular docking methods, i.e., Glide (v8.2)40 and iFitDock42 were used to

419

predict their binding poses. Then a 3D molecular similarity calculation method, SHAFTs43,

420

was used for molecular alignment poses enumeration by matching the critical

421

pharmacophore and volumetric overlay between the N3 molecule within the Mpro structure

422

and the seven drug candidates. However, the selenium atom of ebselen could not be treated

423

by any of these above methods, so sulfur was used to replace it in the calculations. Then

424

the obtained optimal superposition of these molecules were used to assist the reasonability

425

of the predicted binding poses from the two docking methods, and only the binding

426

orientations which were consistent among different methods were kept for constructing the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; this version posted February 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this

427

initial complexes. Finally, these complexes were further optimized (refined binding poses

428

are illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 4) and re-scored (shown in Extended Data Table 2) by

429

using MM-GBSA module44 of Schrödinger, and the residues within 5 Å around the ligand

430

were refined.

431

Antiviral assay for compounds identified from high-throughput screening

432

Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells were incubated at 37°C in Dulbecco’s modified

433

Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL

434

penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin.

435

The COVID-19 was originally isolated from a throat swab specimen from a pneumonia

436

patient and amplified in Vero cells. The in vitro antiviral effects of the selected compounds

437

in Vero cells were assayed as previously described45. Briefly, cultured Vero cells were

438

infected with COVID-19 in the presence of each compounds at the concentration of 10 μM.

439

Cells were then cultured for 72 hours, and the CPE was observed daily and viral RNA copy

440

numbers in supernatants were quantified by in the COVID-19-specific qRT-PCR.

441

Antiviral assay for cinanserin

442

Vero E6 cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and

443

maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco Invitrogen)

444

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a

445

humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. A clinical isolate COVID-19 3 was propagated in Vero

446

E6 cells, and viral titer was determined as described previously45. All the infection

447

experiments were performed at biosafety level-3 (BLS-3).

448

Pre-seeded Vero E6 cells (5×104 cells/well) were pre-treated with the different

449

concentration of the indicated compounds for 1 hour and the virus was subsequently added

450

(MOI of 0.05) to allow infection for 2 hours. Then, the virus-drug mixture was removed

451

and cells were further cultured with fresh drug containing medium. At 24 h p.i., the cell

452

supernatant was collected and viral RNA in supernatant was subjected to qRT-PCR analysis.
