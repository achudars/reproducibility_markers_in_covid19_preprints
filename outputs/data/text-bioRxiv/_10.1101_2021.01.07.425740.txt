Abstract
Rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 that have arisen in the United Kingdom and South
Africa share the spike N501Y substitution, which is of particular concern because it is located in
the viral receptor binding site for cell entry and increases binding to the receptor (angiotensin
converting enzyme 2). We generated isogenic N501 and Y501 SARS-CoV-2. Sera of 20
participants in a previously reported trial of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 had
equivalent neutralizing titers to the N501 and Y501 viruses.

Main text
We previously reported that BNT162b2, a nucleoside modified RNA vaccine that encodes the
SARS-CoV-2 full length, prefusion stabilized spike glycoprotein (S), elicited dose-dependent

SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs) that were similar to or higher than the
GMT of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent human serum samples.1 We subsequently reported
that, in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in approximately 44,000 participants 16 years of
age or older, a two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19.2
Since the previously reported studies were conducted, rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV2 have arisen in the United Kingdom and South Africa.3,4 These variants have multiple mutations
in their S glycoproteins, which are key targets of virus neutralizing antibodies. These rapidly
spreading variants share the spike N501Y substitution. This mutation is of particular concern
because it is located in the viral receptor binding site for cell entry, increases binding to the
receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2), and enables the virus to expand its host range to
infect mice.5,6
We generated an isogenic Y501 SARS-CoV-2 on the genetic background of the N501 clinical
strain USA-WA1/2020, which also provided the genetic background of the BNT162b2-encoded
spike antigen. Sera of 20 participants in the previously reported trial,1,2 drawn 2 or 4 weeks after
immunization with two 30-µg doses of BNT162b2 spaced three weeks apart, were tested for
neutralization of N501 and Y501 viruses by a 50% plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT50;
Figure 1). The ratio of the 50% neutralization GMT of the sera against the Y501 virus to that
against the N501 virus was 1.46, indicating no reduction in neutralization activity against the virus
bearing the Y501 spike (Supplementary material).
A limitation of this finding is that the Y501 virus does not include the full set of spike mutations
found on the rapidly spreading strains in the UK or South Africa.3,4 Nevertheless, preserved
neutralization of Y501 virus by BNT162b2-elicited human sera is consistent with preserved
neutralization of a panel of 15 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with other mutations found in
circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains.7

The ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 necessitates continuous monitoring of the significance of
changes for vaccine coverage. This surveillance is accompanied by preparations for the
possibility that a future mutation in SARS-CoV-2 might necessitate a vaccine strain change. Such
a vaccine update would be facilitated by the flexibility of mRNA-based vaccine technology.
