Abstract

34

The current pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2

35

(SARS-CoV-2) and new outbreaks worldwide highlight the need for preventive treatments.

36

Although angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-

37

2, we identified heparan sulfate proteoglycans expressed by epithelial cells, alveolar

38

macrophages and dendritic cells as co-receptors for SARS-CoV-2. Low molecular weight

39

heparins (LMWH) blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells and alveolar

40

macrophages, and virus dissemination by dendritic cells. Notably, potent neutralizing

41

antibodies from COVID-19 patients interfered with SARS-CoV-2 binding to heparan

42

sulfate proteoglycans, underscoring the importance of heparan sulfate proteoglycans as

43

receptors and uncover that SARS-CoV-2 binding to heparan sulfates is an important

44

mechanism for neutralization. These results have imperative implications for our

45

understanding of SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry and reveal an important target for novel

46

prophylactic intervention.

Introduction

50

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan,

51

China in late 2019 and can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an influenza-

52

like disease ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to severe lung injury, multi organ

53

failure and death (1-3). SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly and has caused a pandemic with a

54

severe impact on global health and world economy (4, 5). SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted

55

predominantly via large droplets expelled from the upper respiratory tract through

56

sneezing and coughing (6, 7) and is subsequently taken up via mucosal surfaces of the

57

nose, mouth and eyes (8). SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, such

58

as ciliated mucus secreting bronchial epithelial cells and type 1 pneumocytes in the lung,

59

as well as epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract (9, 10). To date, there is no treatment

60

to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lockdown strategies and social distancing mitigate viral

61

spread but due to negative socioeconomic consequences these are not feasible long-term

62

solutions (11, 12). Recent renewed outbreaks underscore the urgent need for protective

63

strategies specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2 to prevent further dissemination.

64

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the betacoronaviruses, a family that also includes SARS-CoV

65

and MERS-CoV (13). The coronavirus Spike (S) protein is a class I fusion protein that

66

mediates virus entry (14, 15). The S protein consist of two subunits; S1 directly engages

67

via its receptor‐binding domain (RBD) with host surface receptors (16, 17) and S2

68

mediates fusion between virus and cell membrane (18, 19). SARS-CoV-2 uses

69

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its main receptor (13, 20). ACE2 is a type I

70

integral membrane protein abundantly expressed on epithelial cells lining the respiratory

71

tract (21) but also the ileum, esophagus and liver (22) and ACE2 expression dictates

72

SARS-CoV-2 tropism (10). However, it remains unclear whether SARS-CoV2 requires

73

other receptors for virus entry. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2

74

have been identified that are directed not only at the RBD but also outside the RBD (23),

75

supporting the presence of other receptors. Here we show that the heparan sulfate

76

proteoglycans (HSPG) Syndecan 1 and 4 are required for SARS-CoV-2 infection of

77

permissive cells, and that low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) efficiently inhibited

78

infection of polarized epithelial cells as well as alveolar macrophages. Moreover, we show

79

that primary DC subsets use HSPG as attachment receptors to facilitate dissemination of

SARS-CoV-2. These findings are important to develop prophylactics against SARS-CoV-

81

2 or prevent dissemination early after infection.

82
83

Results

84

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are crucial for SARS-CoV-2 binding and infection

85

Heparan sulfates are expressed by most cells including epithelial cells as heparan sulfate

86

proteoglycans and these have been shown to interact with viruses such as HIV-1, HCV,

87

Sindbis virus and also SARS-CoV (24-28). We incubated Huh 7.5 cells that express ACE2

88

(Supplementary Fig. 1A) with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (23) and observed strong binding

89

of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to cells (Fig. 1A). Binding of SARS-CoV-2 was inhibited by

90

a blocking antibody against ACE2 (Fig. 1A). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus binding

91

was inhibited by neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients directed against the RBD

92

(COVA1-18, COVA2-15) and non-RBD (COVA1-21) epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 S

93

protein (23). Notably, unfractionated (UF) heparin potently inhibited the binding of SARS-

94

CoV-2 pseudovirus to cells comparable to the antibody against ACE2 (Fig. 1B).

95

Enzymatic removal of heparan sulfates on the cell surface by Heparinase treatment

96

decreased SARS-CoV-2 virus binding (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. 1B). Furthermore,

97

we observed that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infected Huh 7.5 cells, which was blocked by

98

UF heparin (Fig. 1D). These data strongly suggest that SARS-CoV-2 requires heparan

99

sulfates to infect ACE2-positive cells.

100
101

Low molecular weight heparins inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection

102

Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) have replaced UF heparin in the clinic as anti-

103

coagulant treatment due to their smaller size and superior pharmacological properties (29)

104

Importantly, LMWH therapy has recently been shown to decrease mortality in severely ill

105

COVID-19 patients (30) and is now used as anti-coagulant prophylaxis for COVID-19

106

patients. Several LMWH are used clinically and differ in size and preparation (31). We

107

therefore screened different LMWHs for their ability to block SARS-CoV-2 binding and

108

infection. All LMWH tested blocked SARS-CoV-2 binding to Huh 7.5 cells and inhibition

109

was similar to that of UF heparin (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the different LMWH inhibited

110

infection of Huh 7.5 cells with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a dose dependent manner

111

(Fig. 2B). Thus, we have identified LMWH as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 binding and

112

infection.

113
114

SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells is blocked by UF heparin and LMWH

115

Human kidney epithelial 293T cells with ectopic expression of ACE2 have been used by

116

different studies to investigate the role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection ((20, 32) and

117

Supplementary Fig. 1C). Ectopic expression of ACE2 on 293T cells rendered these cells

118

susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection but infection was abrogated by both

119

LMWH enoxaparin and UF heparin to a similar level as antibodies against ACE2 (Fig. 3A).

120

The combination of ACE2 antibodies and LMWH enoxaparin or UF heparin fully blocked

121

infection of 293T-ACE2 cells (Fig. 3A). These data strongly suggest that heparan sulfates

122

play a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

123

Epithelial cells expressing ACE2 are thought to be primary target cells for SARS-CoV-2

124

infection in the lung and intestinal tract (21, 33). Non-polarized human colon carcinoma

125

Caco-2 cells efficiently bound SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (Fig. 3B). Treatment with

126

antibodies against ACE2, UF heparin and LMWH enoxaparin blocked virus binding to the

127

epithelial cell line. Non-polarized epithelial cells express low levels of ACE2 ((34) and

128

Supplementary Fig. 1C) and Caco2 cells were infected by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus albeit

129

at a low level. LMWH enoxaparin blocked infection of Caco2 cells similar as antibodies

130

against ACE2 (Fig. 3C). Combining ACE2 antibodies with UF heparin or LMWH

131

enoxaparin did not further increase block in non-polarized Caco2 (Fig. 3B and C). Next

132

we cultured Caco-2 cells on a microporous filter and infected the cells with SARS-CoV-2

133

pseudovirus once they had formed a highly polarized epithelial monolayer. The polarized

134

Caco-2 cells were permissive to infection, which was significantly blocked by LMWH

135

treatment to a similar level as antibodies against ACE2 (Fig. 3D). The combination of an

136

antibody against ACE2 together with LMWH enoxaparin showed the same pattern as each

137

treatment independently (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that heparan sulfates are required

138

for SARS-CoV-2 infection of (non-)polarized epithelial cells.

139
140

Heparan sulfates are required for transmission by primary dendritic cells

141

SARS-CoV-2 infects cells in nasal mucosa, lung and the intestinal tract but mechanisms

142

for dissemination of the virus from the respiratory and intestinal tract are still unclear. It

143

has been suggested that macrophages become infected by SARS-CoV-2 (35), which

144

might promote dissemination. Notably, alveolar macrophages isolated by bronchoalveolar

145

lavage were infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 4A). Importantly, LMWH enoxaparin inhibited

146

infection of primary alveolar macrophages with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4A).Different dendritic

147

cell (DC) subsets have been shown to be involved in dissemination of various viruses

148

including SARS-CoV (36-38). We differentiated monocytes to DC, which is a model for

149

submucosal DC, and also isolated primary human Langerhans cells (LCs) from skin (39,

150

40) as this DC subset resides in epidermis of skin and squamous mucosa of different

151

tissues (41). Both DC and LC efficiently bound SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and binding was

152

inhibited by UF heparin as well as LMWH enoxaparin (Fig. 4B and C). Neither DC nor LC

153

expressed ACE2 (Supplementary Fig. 1A) and, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus did not infect

154

DC nor LC (Fig. 4D and E). However, DC subsets are able to transmit HIV-1 to target cells

155

independent of productive infection (40, 42). We therefore treated DC and LC with SARS-

156

CoV-2 pseudovirus and after washing co-cultured the cells with susceptible Huh 7.5 cells.

157

Notably, both DCs and LCs efficiently transmitted captured SARS-CoV-2 to Huh 7.5 cells

158

and transmission was blocked by UF heparin as well as LMWH enoxaparin pre-treatment

159

(Fig. 4F and G). Thus, our data strongly suggest that DC subsets are involved in virus

160

dissemination of SARS- CoV-2 independent of direct infection and in a heparan sulfate-

161

dependent manner.

162
163

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans Syndecan 1 and 4 are important for SARS-CoV-2

164

binding and infection

165

The heparan sulfate proteoglycan family of Syndecans are particularly important in

166

facilitating cell adhesion of several viruses (28, 43). Therefore we investigated SARS-CoV-

167

2 binding to Namalwa cells expressing Syndecan 1 and 4 (Supplementary Fig. 2A) as

168

these Syndecans are expressed by epithelial cells (44, 45). Namalwa cells did not express

169

ACE2 (Supplementary Fig. 1A). SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus bound to Syndecan 1 and 4

170

transduced cell-lines with higher efficiency than the parental cell-line (Fig. 5A and

171

(Supplementary Fig. 2A). UF heparin and LMWH enoxaparin blocked the interaction of

172

Syndecan 1 and 4 with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (Fig. 5A).

173

Epithelial cells (44, 45) and Huh 7.5 cells express Syndecan 1 and 4 and we silenced both

174

Syndecan 1 and 4 by RNA interference (Supplementary Fig. 2B). Notably, silencing of

175

Syndecan 1 or Syndecan 4 decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection of Huh 7.5 cells (Fig. 5B)

176

supporting a role for Syndecan 1 and 4 in SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that

177

Syndecan 1 and 4 are the main heparan sulfate proteoglycans involved in SARS-CoV-2

178

binding and infection.

179
180

Potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S protein target heparan

181

sulfate-SARS-CoV-2 interactions

182

Recently several potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have been isolated

183

from COVID-19 patients that target the RBD (COVA1-15, COVA1-18) as well as the non-

184

RBD (COVA1- 21) of the S protein (23). In order to investigate whether these antibodies

185

can prevent binding of SARS-CoV-2 to heparan sulfates, we examined their ability to

186

inhibit virus binding to ACE2-negative Namalwa cells expressing Syndecan 1. Notably,

187

the two RBD and the non-RBD binding antibodies blocked the interaction of SARS-CoV-

188

2 pseudovirus with Syndecan 1 to a similar extent as LMWH (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the

189

isotype antibodies did not inhibit virus binding.

190

To investigate whether these antibodies specifically block the interaction of SARS-CoV-2

191

with heparan sulfates, we coated UF heparin and measured SARS-CoV-2 S protein

192

binding. SARS- CoV-2 S protein efficiently bound to coated heparin (Fig. 6B). All three

193

antibodies against S protein blocked the interaction of heparin with SARS-CoV-2, strongly

194

suggesting that the neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 interfere with heparan

195

sulfate binding by the virus. Thus, our data strongly suggest that neutralization by

196

antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can occur via ACE2 inhibition but also by preventing

197

SARS-CoV-2 binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and underscores the importance

198

of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in infection.

199
200

Discussion

201

Here we have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection is not only dependent on ACE2 but also

202

requires heparan sulfate proteoglycans and in particular Syndecan 1 and 4. Our data

203

suggest that SARS-CoV-2 attaches to cells via HSPG, which facilitates thereby interaction

204

with ACE2 and subsequent infection. Moreover, we also identified HSPG as important

205

receptors facilitating ACE2-independent transmission by primary DCs. Infection as well as

206

transmission with SARS-CoV-2 was efficiently inhibited by the clinically adapted UF

207

heparin and LMWH. It further suggests that neutralizing antibodies isolated from COVID-

208

19 patients could at least partially inhibit SARS- CoV- 2 binding to heparan sulfate

209

proteoglycans and thereby interfere with infection. These results have important

210

implications for our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry and reveal a relevant

211

target for novel prophylactic intervention.

212
213

Recently, is has been suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein interacts with heparan

214

sulfate molecules and heparin (46-48). Here we have identified heparan sulfates and in

215

particular Syndecan 1 and 4 as important receptors for SARS-CoV-2. Our data strongly

216

suggest that the heparan sulfate proteoglycans are required for virus binding and infection

217

of epithelial cells. LMWH or UF heparin efficiently abrogated virus infection to a similar

218

extent as ACE2 antibodies and combinations of ACE2 antibodies, suggesting that both

219

receptors are required for virus infection. To investigate the role of SARS-CoV-2 infection

220

in primary cells, we isolated alveolar macrophages and epidermal LCs, and cultured

221

monocyte-derived DCs. Interestingly, alveolar macrophages were infected by SARS-CoV-

222

2 in a HSPG dependent manner whereas neither LCs nor DCs were infected. The role of

223

alveolar macrophages in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still unclear but it has been

224

hypothesized that they can infiltrate other tissues or induce pro-inflammatory cytokines

225

and chemokines upon infection (49), indicating a potential detrimental role in disease

226

progression. Interestingly, infection of primary alveolar macrophages isolated from lung

227

was also inhibited by LMWH, suggesting an important role for LMWH protection in lung

228

tissue not as an anti-coagulant but as an antiviral.

229

DCs migrate from mucosal tissues and epidermis into lymphoid tissues (50) and therefore

230

it is thought that DCs are involved in the dissemination of viruses after infection (51). Our

231

data strongly suggest that DCs similarly are involved in SARS-CoV-2 dissemination via

232

HSPG as primary DC subsets isolated from skin or derived from blood monocytes strongly

233

bound SARS-CoV-2 via HSPG and efficiently transmitted the virus to target epithelial cells.

234

The HSPG cell surface receptor primarily expressed by epithelial cells is Syndecan 1 (44,

235

52) and is involved in cell recruitment, proliferation and inflammations (45) but can also

236

bind viruses like Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) (43) and Hepatitis C virus (53). Syndecan

237

4 is further expressed ubiquitously albeit at lower levels (45). Recently we could show that

238

Syndecan 4 is involved in transmission of HCV by LCs (28) whereas Syndecan 3 facilitates

239

binding and transmission of HIV-1 (54). In this study we demonstrate the interaction of

240

specific Syndecans with SARS-CoV-2 and underscore their importance for virus

241

attachment and dissemination.

242

Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are a potential therapy for COVID-19

243

patients and several potent monoclonal neutralizing antibodies have been identified that

244

target the RBD and non-RBD sites of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (23). However, while

245

most of the antibodies are suggested to inhibit ACE2 binding sites, the non-RBD

246

antibodies COVA1-21 does not seem to interfere with ACE2 and instead interfere with

247

other COVA antibodies and as yet unidentified receptors. Notably, two RBD antibodies

248

COVA1-18 and COVA2-15 blocked virus as well as S protein binding to heparan sulfates,

249

indicating that the RBD is also involved in heparan sulfate interactions (23). Moreover, our

250

data suggest that COVA1-21 targets the heparan binding site of the S protein. Recent

251

studies suggest that the heparan sulfate binding site of the S protein are outside the RBD

252

of SARS-CoV-2 (47, 48). The finding that neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2

253

block heparan sulfate interactions suggest that this is an important target for neutralization

254

of the and underscores the importance of the interaction for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus

255

this finding shows that the unusually potent antibodies COVA1-18 and 2-15 can neutralize

256

SARS-CoV-2 through two mechanisms: preventing SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 (23)

257

and to heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

258

LMWHs are already used as subcutaneous treatment of COVID-19 patients to prevent

259

systemic clotting (55, 56). Interestingly, here we have identified an important ability of

260

LMWH to directly block SARS-CoV-2 binding and infection of epithelial cells as well as

261

preventing virus transmission. Our data support the use of LMWH as prophylactic

262

treatment for SARS-CoV-2 as well as a treatment option early in infection to block further

263

infection and dissemination. LMWH inhalation has been studied to attenuate inflammatory

264

responses in COPD and asthma patients and is considered safe to use as a prophylactic.

265

The clinical use of LMWH to treat COVID-19 and our finding that LMWH block virus

266

infection and dissemination strongly advocate for the prophylactic use of LMWH in

267

individuals at risk for infection, or short after infection or even for a general population

268

during outbreaks we still observe daily to quickly limit transmission events.

269

In summary, this study provided new insights into how SARS-CoV-2 initiates attachment,

270

infection and transmission in different cell types and showed that LMWH are possible

271

candidates for prophylactic intervention and antiviral treatment.

382

includes healthy male volunteers aged 18-35. In this study, the subjects are given a first

383

hit of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and, two hours later, a second hit of either fresh or aged

384

platelet concentrate or NaCl 0.9%. Six hours after the second hit, a BAL is performed by

385

a trained pulmonologist according to national guidelines. Fractions 2-8 are pooled and

386

split in two, one half is centrifuged (4 °C, 1750 G, 10 min.), the cell pellet of which was

387

used in this research. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, subjects are also screened for

388

SARS-CoV-2 (via throat swab PCR) 2 days prior to the BAL. All subjects in the DIVA study

389
