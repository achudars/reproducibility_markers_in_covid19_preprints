Abstract: Recently, there has been an outbreak associated with the use of e-cigarette or vaping

products, associated lung injury (EVALI). The primary components of vaping products, vitamin E
acetate (VEA) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) may be responsible for acute lung toxicity.
Currently, little information is available on the physiological and biological effects of exposure to
these products. We hypothesized that these e-cig cartridges and their constituents (VEA and MCT)
induce pulmonary toxicity, mediated by oxidative damage and inflammatory responses, leading to
acute lung injury. We studied the potential mechanisms of cartridge aerosol induced
inflammatory response by evaluating the generation of reactive oxygen species by MCT, VEA, and
cartridges, and their effects on the inflammatory state of pulmonary epithelium and immune cells
both in vitro and in vivo. Cells exposed to these aerosols generated reactive oxygen species, caused
cytotoxicity, induced epithelial barrier dysfunction, and elicited an inflammatory response. Using a
murine model, the parameters of acute toxicity to aerosol inhalation were assessed. Infiltration of
neutrophils and lymphocytes was accompanied by significant increases in IL-6, eotaxin, and G-CSF
in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). In mouse plasma, eicosanoid inflammatory mediators,
leukotrienes, were significantly increased. Plasma from e-cig users also showed increased levels of
hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETEs) and various eicosanoids. Exposure to e-cig cartridge
aerosols showed the most significant effects and toxicity compared to MCT and VEA. In addition,
we determined at SARS-COV-2 related proteins and found no impact associated with aerosol
exposures from these tested cartridges. Overall, this study demonstrates acute exposure to specific
e-cig cartridges induces in vitro cytotoxicity, barrier dysfunction, and inflammation and in vivo
mouse exposure induces acute inflammation with elevated pro-inflammatory markers in the
pathogenesis of EVALI.

Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) products are battery-operated devices equipped
with a tank, cartridge, or a pod filled with a liquid (e-liquid). These e-liquids may contain a base
liquid (humectant), such as propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG). Other contents
include nicotine, flavoring chemicals, and flavor enhancers. Recently, cartridges containing
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) have been introduced to the ENDS market.
These cartridges predominantly use carriers such as mineral oil and medium-chain triglycerides
(MCT) oil. The heating element in these cartridges, i.e., coil/atomizer, raises the temperature of the
e-liquid or oil to aerosolize its constituents. Some of these products have become abundantly
available in the market containing adulterants, such as butane hash oil (a.k.a dabs) [1]. Using these
products has caused acute lung injury to many e-cigarette (e-cig) users and the disease was
recognized as e-cigarette, or vaping, associated lung injury (EVALI) in August 2019. As of February
2020, a total of 2807 hospitalized cases or deaths have associated with EVALI, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [2]. Symptoms of EVALI include labored breathing,
dyspnea, chest pain, cough, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, fever, and weight loss [3,4].

All EVALI patients have a history of e-cigarette use or vaping and the majority report using THC
containing vaping products. No single constituent has been identified as the causative agent of
EVALI. However, vitamin E acetate has been found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of
EVALI patients [5]. Most of the subsequent analyses have been geared towards the constituents of
e-liquids like Vitamin-E acetate (VEA) as implicated in these ENDS-user subjects [6-8]. There is an
urgent need for experimental-based studies to implicate the causative role of VEA in EVALI or other
lung conditions reported. There is a gap in research and knowledge of pulmonary effects and vaping
mediated toxicity. Additionally, inhalation toxicology studies in vitro and in vivo are needed to
investigate the effects of exposure to constituents of e-liquids and vaping cartridges.

In this study, we provide the mechanisms of toxicity of inhalation exposure to e-cig cartridges and
their major components. We assessed the total volatile organic compounds in the aerosols and
conducted an in vitro toxicity assessment using lung epithelial cells and monocytes. The parameters
of in vitro toxicity assessment included cell viability, ROS generation, trans-epithelial barrier
function, and inflammatory mediators. To assess the acute inhalation toxicity of MCT, VEA, and
e-cig cartridge aerosols in vivo, an acute exposure mouse model was utilized. In these exposed
mouse groups, immune cell influx and cytokines in BALF were quantified to investigate the elicited
inflammatory response compared to the unexposed counterparts. In addition, we studied at
SARS-COV-2 related proteins and found no impact associated with aerosol exposures from these
tested cartridges. We demonstrated a reduction in surfactant protein A in lung homogenates of VEA
exposed mice, which plays a role in lipid homeostasis and innate immune defense. Lipidomics
analyses performed on BALF of mice exposed to MCT, VEA, and e-cig cartridge aerosols, as well as
plasma of e-cig users, showed changes in eicosanoids and, exhibiting their role in pulmonary
inflammation. Further, we found altered glycerolipids, cholesterol esters, and glycerophospholipids
in mouse BALF upon acute VEA and cartridge exposure. We hypothesized that VEA, MCT, and
other chemical constituents present in e-cigarette cartridges [9] cause cellular toxicity, and oxidative
and inflammatory responses in epithelial cells, monocytes, and in vivo in mouse lung upon
inhalation.

16-HBE cells (20,000 cells/well) were cultured on 24-well transwell inserts (Corning cat# 3470)
until the cells reached a complete monolayer. Cells were then serum-deprived at 1% FBS 12-hours
before exposure. Cells were exposed to MCT, VEA, and cartridge aerosols using the previously
described aerosol exposure setup. 24-hours later, the barrier function was evaluated by recording
the transepithelial voltage and resistance by EVOM2 (WPI instruments, FL). Each well was
measured three times, and the average unit area resistance was calculated. Cartridge aerosol
exposed data points were then pooled, and the average was compared with the unexposed air

Mouse BALF samples (200 µL) and human plasma from one of our e-cig studies were analyzed
by Cayman chemicals, MI, for eicosanoids/oxylipins and short-chain-fatty-acids by LC-MS/MS. Heat
maps were generated depicting the changes in analytes. Analytes showing distinct differences were
then graphed as box-whisker plots. Untargeted lipidomic profiling was performed by normalizing
peak areas with internal standards. Air control samples were compared with VEA and cartridge
exposed samples, and only the statistically significant analytes were included in Table 1.

Oil-Red-O staining was performed on lung OCT-cryosections and immobilized MM6 cells
using BioVision Cat# K580-24 according to manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, the oil-red-o stock
was made in 20 mL 100% isopropanol. The slides were incubated in 60% isopropanol for 5 minutes,
followed by evenly covering with Oil-Red-O working solution. The slides were then placed on a
shaker and incubated for 20 minutes. After rinsing the slides with dH2O, hematoxylin was added
and incubated for 1 minute. After rinsing the slides with dH2O five times, the slides were viewed
under the microscope. Lipid-laden-indices were calculated in representative images of MM6 stained

The method for LLI scoring of the Oil-Red-O stained monocytes was adapted from Kazachkov
et al. [12]. In two representative images, the total macrophages in each field were counted. Then,
macrophages with <50% of the cytoplasm opacified by the stain were assigned a score of “1”.
Macrophages with >50% of the cytoplasm opacified by the stain were assigned a scored of “2”. The
LLI was then calculated as follows: LLI=((% 1+ macrophages)×1)+((% 2+ macrophages)×2).

3.1 MCT, VEA, and e-cig cartridges induce cellular and acellular ROS generation and cytotoxic
responses

273
274
275
276

BEAS-2B cells generated increased cellular ROS production upon treatment with MCT, VEA,
and cartridges compared to untreated controls. Cellular ROS levels increased with respect to time.
The highest cellular ROS generation was observed in MCT-treated cells, followed by VEA-treated
and cartridge-treated cells (N=4) (Figure 1A).

278
279
280

Acellular ROS was determined by drawing vapors from VEA, MCT, and e-cig cartridges
through DCFH dye. MCT, VEA, and e-cig cartridges generated significantly increased acellular ROS
levels (in H2O2 equivalents) compared to air, but did not differ between treatment groups One-way
ANOVA ***p<0.001 vs. Air (N=2-4) (Figure 1B).

BEAS-2B cells exposed to VEA and e-cig cartridge aerosols caused variable cell death, although
non-statistically significant, compared to the air group. Among aerosols, e-cig cartridges caused the
greatest cytotoxicity (up to 34% cell death, n=6). Monocytes, MM6, treated with VEA or MCT did not
cause significantly increased cytotoxicity. However, MM6 treated with 0.25% e-cig cartridge liquid
caused significant cytotoxicity (up to 98%, n=9).

306

Conditioned media from aerosol exposed cells were assayed for IL-8 and IL-6 to determine the
elicited inflammatory response by individual cells. Both MCT and VEA induced a mild increase in
IL-8 and IL-6 compared to their unexposed controls. Exposure to e-cig cartridge aerosols induced
highly significant IL-6 and IL-8 levels (One-way ANOVA, *p<0.05 and ***p<0.001 vs. control, n=6)
(Figure 2A,B).

In MM6 cells, while the treatment with MCT did not cause any changes in these cytokine levels,
treatment with VEA and cartridge liquid caused an elevation in IL-6 levels. VEA induced
significantly elevated IL-6 levels in monocytes (One-way ANOVA, *p<0.05 vs. control, n=6) (Figure
2C).

Exposure to certain electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) cartridges has recently
increased hospitalizations due to respiratory failure [6-8,13,14]. According to case reports since 2012,
e-cig users with symptoms without direct etiology have undergone various diagnoses, including
acute lung injury, atypical pneumonitis, and eosinophilic or lipoid pneumonia [6,13]. The presence
of abnormal lipid-laden macrophages in lung tissue samples from EVALI subjects has been
associated with lipoid pneumonia [15,16]. The patients diagnosed with lipoid-pneumonia suffered
from cough, difficulty in breathing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and pain, nausea, vomiting,
fatigue, fever, and weight loss. In one of our studies, we analyzed the chemical constituents of e-cig
cartridges involved in EVALI [9]. Users of these ENDS products developed varying degrees of
respiratory illnesses, but the mechanism of toxicity of developing EVALI is still unknown.

In this study, we studied the mechanisms of toxicity in developing EVALI. Constituents in e-cig
cartridges affect the inflammatory state of pulmonary epithelial cells, immune cells, and exposed
mice. MCT and mineral oil are used as the vehicle (humectant) in these cartridges. Upon heating,
these products emit volatile organic compounds. In cartridge aerosols, we saw nearly double the
amount of VOCs compared to MCT, mineral oil, or VEA aerosols. The highest total VOCs were
released by the vape cartridges followed by MCT oil, mineral oil, and VEA compared to air,
suggesting carbonyl stress by these compounds. These VOCs in e-cig cartridges can generate toxic
compounds, such as THC/VEA carbonyl complexes and ketene, during pyrolysis, leading to lung
damage [17,18]. In this study, we also observed significant acellular and cellular ROS generation by
cartridges and their major components. These highly reactive species vary based on vaping patterns
and can lead to lung pathogenesis [19]. Increased levels of IL-6 and IL-8 are clear indicators of an
ongoing inflammatory response in epithelial cells and monocytes. IL-8 is a potent neutrophil
attractant that can induce lung damage by degranulation of stored mediators and enzymes,
oxidative bursts, as well as the release of neutrophil extracellular traps [20,21].

Exposure to e-cig cartridge aerosols showed severe toxicity in monocytes, as well as
significantly elevated IL-6 levels, a biomarker for lung injury. This indicates that in less than 24
hours, the immune system can be primed towards a pro-inflammatory response [22]. In this study,
two puffs of aerosols significantly affected the epithelial barrier function; this is consistent with other
studies our lab, as well as other researchers, have published [23,24]. Toxicants emitted in these
aerosols damage tight junctions between the epithelial cells disrupting the epithelial barrier. This
alteration of the epithelial permeability drives pathogenesis by promoting inflammatory signaling
pathways [23,24].

Radiological and histological analyses of lungs with darkened patches and ground-glass
opacities suggest that volatile hydrocarbons such as terpenes and oils in e-cigs are possibly involved
in the pathogenesis of EVALI [25,26]. Various hydrocarbons and reactive aldehydes are formed
upon heating and thermal decomposition of e-liquids around 500 F. All these cartridges are used at
around a 3.5V to 5.5 V setting using a specific device, which is similar to CBD containing cartridges.
These emitted chemicals may play an important role in the pathogenesis of EVALI, apart from MCT
and VEA. Further studies with chronic animal exposures are required for histopathological studies.

Formation of foamy macrophages in BALF and lung tissue has been used as a diagnostic tool
for vaping associated lung injuries [16,26,27]. In this study, we observed the formation of lipid-laden
macrophages in MM6 cells treated with MCT, VEA, and cartridges. E-cig cartridge liquids showed
more Oil-Red-O staining compared to VEA, suggesting that contents of these cartridges, such as
other oils, including MCT, can potentially cause exogenous lipoid pneumonia upon inhalation and

macrophages; however, we did not notice any lipid-laden macrophages in lung sections (data not
shown), suggesting that the formation of these lipids may take longer than this exposure duration. In
the cytokine profile, significantly increased IL-6, eotaxin, and G-CSF were observed. Increased
G-CSF in BALF has been seen in patients with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), which
has been correlated with pulmonary neutrophilia [29-31]. This is consistent with our findings that
showed neutrophil influx (Figure 5A). In many cases, acute alveolitis has been associated with an
influx of eosinophils and neutrophils [32,33]. Similar to radiological images of lungs showing
ground-glass opacity, presence of lipids, and the influx of cells usually seen in cases with
hydrocarbon and oil inhalation have also been identified in images from vaping related lung injuries
[34]. The increase in eotaxin (Figure 6B) suggests eosinophilic chemotaxis in the lung tissue and
lavage as eotaxin plays a major role in recruiting eosinophils to the sites of inflammation [35].
Corroborating our data, exposure to ENDS has been shown to augment the levels of IL-6 in BALF
along with increased neutrophils and CD4+ cells [14].

In many studies, IL-6 has been shown to increase with exposure to any insult causing acute lung
injury to maintain the homeostasis of the inflammatory response [36-38]. The increase in G-CSF and
eotaxin along with the increase in CD4 cells in BALF suggest that acute exposure may be leaning
toward the Th2 pathway, implicating potential eosinophilic pneumonia with prolonged exposure
[39-41]. Excessive inflammation results in lung damage in diseases. IL-17 plays an important role in
leukocyte infiltration. Studies have shown reduced G-CSF secretion in IL-17R−/− mice and that these
mice were protected against ARDS [42,43]. In this study, aerosol exposure resulted in attenuated
levels of MCP-1, RANTES, IL-17A, IL12p40, and IL-4 in BALF (Figure 6D-H). The occurrence of
eosinophilia and eosinophil alveolitis has been observed in patients with idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis [44]. Consistent with observations in this study, increased CD3+ lymphocytes in BALF and
protection against fibrosis in IL-4 deficient mice have been observed in another study [45]. Moreover,
RANTES and MCP-1 are heavily involved in leukocyte influx and bronchial hyperresponsiveness
[46]. Similarly, the observed significant decrease in IL12p40 suggests the balancing of the
propagated inflammatory response as IL12p40 can be pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic [47]. The
reduction of these cytokines and chemokines implicates a negative feedback of the immune system
to sustain homeostasis. In a previous study, we observed that cannabidiol (CBD) containing
e-cigarettes possess anti-inflammatory properties by upregulating the MCPIP1 transcription factor
[48]. As the tested e-cig cartridges possibly contained THC and CBD, it is possible that these drugs
also contributed to the induced cytokine storm. Further studies are needed to understand the
mechanisms of this immune modulation, such as understanding the role of innate lymphoid cells
(ILCs) in response to exposure to e-cigarette cartridge components and toxicants. ILC2 and ILC3 are
pivotal to the homeostatic response to environmental toxicants with a poised immune response to
alleviate lung damage and maintain lung function [49].

In our lipidomics analysis of mouse BALF exposed to VEA and cartridge aerosols, we observed
increased levels of lipid mediators: leukotrienes. Leukotrienes (LTCs) are 5-lipoxygenase
metabolites that are vital for lung epithelial and endothelial barrier function [50]. Cysteinal
leukotrienes, such as LTC4, have been shown to play a role in allergic asthma development via
group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) activation and propagation [51]. In other animals such as dogs,
rats, and rabbits, increased LTC4 in BALF has been seen in association with injured lungs and the
formation of extravascular lung water [52]. These animal studies suggest that in our murine model,
exposure to VEA and cartridges has promoted allergic asthma-related inflammation-causing lung
injury, especially in VEA exposed mice. However, it may be possible that these lower LTC4 levels
seen in the cartridge exposed group may be confounded by the presence of nicotine as nicotine has
LTC4 suppressive effects [53,54].

In e-cig users of our cohort, we observed increased systemic oxidative stress and inflammatory
responses [10]. These samples also showed increased hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) in

plasma. HETES are well-known biomarkers of oxidative stress, and elevated levels of HETE isomers
have been found in smokers [55]. In this study, we found HETE isomers 5, 11, and 12 induction in
e-cig users’ plasma with other lipid mediators. These metabolites of arachidonic acid play an
important role in mediating inflammation in the lungs. HETES are involved in neutrophil
transcellular migration and proliferation of cells elicited inflammatory response during acute lung
injury [56,57]. Moreover, our untargeted lipidomics analysis showed altered glycerolipids (DG),
cholesterol esters (CE), and glycerophospholipids (PG and PC) in BALF. A study comparing
metabolomic similarities between smokers and cigarette smoke-exposed mice revealed highly
correlated augmented levels of glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids in mouse BALF with the
exposure to cigarette smoke [58]. Thus, it can be inferred that a similar modulation in lipids occurred
with cartridge exposures. Surfactant-associated protein A (SP-A) was reduced in lung homogenates
of VEA exposed male mice. Surfactant proteins are important to prevent lung atelectasis and the
reduction of SP-A may suggest excess accumulation of lipids in the alveolar space as we
demonstrated with this acute exposure. Consistent with our observations, reduced surfactant
proteins in BALF and lung homogenates have been seen in mice exposed to ENDS independent of
nicotine [14].

Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, smokers have shown to have more adverse outcomes upon
infection. In our acutely exposed lung homogenates, we looked at ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Furin
protein abundance and observed no association with cartridge exposures. The decrease in furin,
spike glycoprotein cleaving protease, in male mice with the MCT exposure needs to be further
investigated[59]. The exacerbated response in smokers and vapers may suggest that smoking/vaing
with nicotine and α7nAChR with ACE2 may be involved [60].

Overall, based on our data, it is possible that both VEA and e-cig cartridge may have caused
acute respiratory distress inducing eosinophilic pneumonia. As we found in our previous study,
most of these cartridges contained THC derivatives and VEA [9]. At low concentrations, VEA was
not cytotoxic. Moreover, VEA has been employed as a carrier in therapeutic interventions [61],
suggesting that it may act as a carrier for THC in the blood and the brain. Upon aerosolization, VEA
or its formed oxidant derivatives may interact with phospholipids and surfactants of the epithelial
lining fluid, thus adversely affect the normal lung function [62,63]. In e-liquids, VEA is used along
with mineral oil and MCT oils, and there’s a lack of understanding of inhalation toxicity of these
additives and diluents. Based on our results, MCT had lesser effects compared to VEA in vivo, but it
showed comparable effects to VEA in vitro; overall, cartridges containing both of these components
showed the greatest effects. Other than these two primary components, it may be possible that other
constituents in cartridges are also responsible for EVALI; those chemicals include cyclooctasiloxane,
cyclohexasiloxane, cyclotrisiloxane, tricaprylate, decanoic acid, benzoic acid, 2,2-dimethoxybutane,
and tetramethyl silicate [9].

In summary, this study demonstrates acute exposure to specific e-cig cartridges induce in vitro
cytotoxicity, barrier dysfunction, and inflammation and in vivo mouse exposure induces acute
inflammation with elevated pro-inflammatory markers. It was also found that SARS-COV-2 related
proteins had no impact associated with aerosol exposures from these tested cartridges or other
agents tested. Overall, this study suggests that prolonged exposure to these ENDS may cause
significant lung damage, which is involved in the pathogenesis of EVALI.
