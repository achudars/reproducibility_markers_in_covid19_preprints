Abstract
Genomic surveillance can lead to early identification of novel viral variants and inform
pandemic response. Using this approach, we identified a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
that emerged in the United States (U.S.). The earliest sequenced genomes of this variant, referred
to as 20C-US, can be traced to Texas in late May of 2020. This variant circulated in the U.S.

20

uncharacterized for months and rose to recent prevalence during the third pandemic wave. It
initially acquired five novel, relatively unique non-synonymous mutations. 20C-US is continuing
to acquire multiple new mutations, including three independently occurring spike protein
mutations. Monitoring the ongoing evolution of 20C-US, as well as other novel emerging
variants, will be essential for understanding SARS-CoV-2 host adaptation and predicting

25

pandemic outcomes.

Introduction
In early 2020 the World Health Organization declared that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), a potentially fatal respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, was a global pandemic (1).
5

The high number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide over time has presented the virus with
ample opportunity to acquire new mutations. It has been suggested that some mutations already
present a fitness advantage for the virus. Notably, the D614G mutation, observed early in the
pandemic, is thought to increase the transmissibility of the virus (2, 3). The N501Y mutation of
the spike protein (S) has been implicated in the rapid spread of new variants in the United

10

Kingdom and South Africa (4-6). A growing number of spike protein mutations could enable
immune evasion and reduced vaccine efficacy (7).
The U.S. has experienced a surge in cases during the third pandemic wave over the fall of 2020
and winter of 2020/2021. While many variables are likely to drive the increase in cases, it is

15

possible that emergence of a more fit or transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant could be a
contributing factor (5). Restrictions in population movement during a global pandemic, as well
as the rapid acquisition of multiple mutations, could drive emergence of novel region-specific
variants. This evolutionary paradigm might explain the rise of distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants
now being observed around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic (5, 6, 8).

20

Here we report the characterization of a SARS-CoV-2 variant, 20C-US, that emerged in and has
remained mostly confined to the U.S. Its quiet rise to prominence among other circulating
variants in the late summer and early fall of 2020 coincides with the third U.S. pandemic wave.
Based on existing genomic data, we predict that this variant may already be the most dominant
25

variant of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S., likely accounting for the majority of COVID-19 cases. In
addition to the five signature mutations of the 20C-US variant, new mutations continue to accrue.
These include protease, nucleocapsid, and spike protein mutations that highlight the ongoing
evolution of SARS-CoV-2.

In response to anticipated genetic changes occurring in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we began
sequencing viral genomes for genomic epidemiology and surveillance. With sequencing focused
on the U.S. upper Midwest in the state of Illinois, we generated full genome sequences from
samples taken beginning in March 2020 to present. During phylogenetic reconstruction with our
5

Illinois genome sequences, a particular branch within the 20C clade became noticeably more
pronounced (Fig. 1A). We identified five closely co-occurring signature mutations that appeared
synapomorphic to the new clade within 20C. These mutations resulted in amino acid changes of
N1653D and R2613C in ORF1b, G172V in ORF3a, and P67S and P199L in the nucleocapsid
(N) gene, the last of which also introduces a stop codon mutation at position Q46 of ORF14

to the new variant became apparent (Fig. 1D). Geographic visualization from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31,
2020 revealed that nearly half of all recently sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the U.S. are
the new variant of interest (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, this variant has thus far only been reported at
very low levels in a handful of other countries, including Mexico, Australia, New Zealand,
5

Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, Poland and Israel. Therefore, we have termed this new variant
20C-US.
Tracing a timeline and geographic origin of the 20C-US variant
We attempted to establish a timeline and geographic origin for the emergence of 20C-US by

10

tracing the appearance of mutations in sequenced genomes. We selected all SARS-CoV-2
genomes from the global GISAID database that possessed the five hallmark mutations of 20CUS as well as two prerequisite mutations that appear key to the 20C-US lineage based on
phylogenetic reconstructions, which are ORF8:S24L and ORF1a:L3352F. The majority of
genomes bearing these two mutations were from Minnesota and Louisiana during March and

15

April, 2020. The first signature mutation of 20C-US, ORF3a:G172V, then appears in four
genomes from Louisiana and one from Arizona in April. A series of genome sequences are then
reported in late May and early June that contain the remaining four signature mutations
simultaneously, suggesting either a rapid succession of mutations or an event where most or all
were acquired in a single patient. Those genomes primarily originated from Texas samples, with

20

the earliest being from the greater Houston, Texas area on May 20, 2020. The new 20C-US
variant then becomes prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences across the U.S. over time
(Fig. 1C).
Identification of recent mutations of potential interest in the 20C-US phylogenetic lineage

25

To further characterize 20C-US, we identified all GISAID samples with the signature mutations
of ORF3a:G172V, ORF1b:N1653D, and N:P67S and that also possessed N:P199L or any
mutations at position 2613 for ORF1b. We then reconstructed a phylogenetic tree with these
4681 sequences. A branching event was observed in this new tree that was initiated by two new
mutations, a synonymous mutation at the nucleotide level, C14805T, that co-occurs at the same

30

time with a non-synonymous mutation of the ORF1a gene that changes M2606 to I2606 (Table
2, Fig. 2A). The co-occurrence of these two mutations in the 20C-US lineage was first observed

in late June of 2020. The first full 20C-US genome reported with this mutation and possessing
the expected genotype was from Wisconsin on June 23, 2020 followed by an Illinois case on
June 25, 2020. Visualizing the geographic distribution of 20C-US genomes with the
ORF1a:M2606I mutation demonstrated that it has achieved high prevalence in the eastern and
10

midwestern regions but has not yet spread widely to the western and southwestern regions of the
U.S. (Fig. 2B). The ORF1a:M2606I mutation accounts for 48% of all 20C-US genomes.
Within the new clade defined by ORF1a:M2606I, three additional branches of significance
emerge. One is a nucleocapsid mutation at position 377, converting an aspartate (D) to tyrosine

15

(Y) (Table 2). Since the summer months of 2020, this mutation has occurred many times in the
20A, 20B, and 20C clades. However, it has clearly established a distinct and well-developed
branch within the ORF1a:M2606I lineage of 20C-US (Fig. 2C). When viewed geographically,
its distribution closely mirrors that of the ORF1a:M2606I 20C-US genotype (Fig. 2D).

Two other mutations that have established more recent branches within the same lineage as
ORF1a:M2606I are Q677H (Fig. 2E) and Q173K mutations in the spike (S) gene (Table 2). The
earliest 20C-US genomes in the GISAID database having ORF1a:M2606I and S:Q677H
originated from Minnesota and Wisconsin on August 17, 2020. Mutation of Q677 to lysine (K),
5

arginine (R), proline (P), or histidine (H) has occurred spontaneously throughout the pandemic in
many lineages, including branches of the 20A, 20B, and 20C clades. However, an S:Q677
mutation has never established and expanded well until recently in the ORF1a:M2606I lineage.
Within the ORF1a:M2606I lineage, the S:Q677H mutation represents 10.2% of genomes and a
map view illustrates that S:Q677H mutants remain largely localized to the upper Midwest, which

10

includes Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan (Fig. 2F). Both N:D377Y and S:Q677H have
appeared many times but only established as strong branches after 20C-US acquired the
ORF1a:M2606I mutation, suggesting the possibility of an epistatic interaction between these
mutations (10). The S:Q173K mutation is rather unique for SARS-CoV-2 and also falls in the
ORF1a:M2606I lineage of 20C-US. It has established a small but growing branch in the 20C-US

15

clade. Finally, 20C-US has also begun harboring a number of recent mutations to the S gene
outside of the ORF1a:M2606I lineage that convert asparagine (N) 501 to either tyrosine (Y) or
threonine (T). Thus far, fifteen recent 20C-US genomes have been found with S:N501Y/T
mutations, several with S:N501Y from Texas on the same branch of the 20C-US phylogeny.

20

To better understand the emergence of new mutations, we plotted the percentage of 20C-US
genomes possessing ORF1a:M2606I versus time for the U.S. (Fig. 2G-H). Interestingly, we
observed an apparent slowing or reduction in the percentage of 20C-US variants carrying the
ORF1a:M2606I mutation. Performing a similar analysis for N:D377Y revealed a similar trend. If
decreases in the fraction of a variant over time are taken as an indication of potential fitness loss

25

(11), then this mutation may not be improving the fitness of its parent lineage. However, the
same analysis for S:Q677H and S:Q173K (as a percentage of US-20C genomes that also carry
the ORF1a:M2606I mutation) revealed that these two mutations are not decreasing at a similar
rate as the ORF1a:M2606I and N:D377Y mutants of 20C at this time (Fig. 2H), suggesting a
potential increase in fitness. It is possible that genetic drift or a lag in genome sequence reporting

30

could account for these aberrations, especially when so few genomes containing S:Q677H and
S:Q173K in the 20C-US lineage are currently available. Indeed, both could track more closely

with ORF1a:M2606I as more genome sequences become available. However, it is also possible
that ORF1a:M2606I results in slightly lower fitness compared to its parent 20C-US lineage over
time and the more recent spike protein mutations may compensate to help rescue fitness. Better
resolution of these data through additional sequencing over time should determine the fate and
5

impact of these novel mutations.
Biological implications of 20C-US mutations
Several mutations carried by the 20C-US variant suggest biochemical or functional impacts on
SARS-CoV-2 biology. ORF1b:N1653D is highly unique and specific to the 20C-US lineage.

10

This mutation occurs at residue 138 in the ExoN domain of nonstructural protein (nsp) 14, a
novel RNA proofreading domain that ensures the integrity of RNA genomes and transcripts (12).
ExoN inactivation is lethal to SARS-CoV-2 (13). The mutation of asparagine (N) to aspartate
(D) at this position represents conversion from a neutral to a negatively charged residue in a low
complexity domain, possibly involved in mediating protein-protein or RNA-protein interactions

15

(14) (Fig. 3A). In addition, nsp14 plays a critical enzymatic role by installing a methyl group on
the base of the 5' guanine cap for viral RNA transcripts, which is essential for translation into
viral proteins (12, 13). Interestingly, the other essential viral factor involved in cap formation on
viral transcripts is nsp16, which catalyzes 2'-O-methylation of the nucleotide adjacent to the
terminal 7-methyl-guanine cap on viral RNA transcripts (12, 15). The signature 20C-US

20

mutation ORF1b:R2613C results in a conversion of arginine (R) to cysteine (C) at residue 216 of
nsp16, which would be predicted to disrupt hydrogen bonding to an adjacent glutamate and
structured water molecule and possibly alter local protein stability (Fig. 3B). These two rather
unique mutations co-occur in 20C-US and could potentially alter genome integrity, mutation
retention, transcript integrity, and translation efficiency of viral messenger RNA.

25

The two largest SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA transcripts, ORF1a and ORF1b, are translated into
polyproteins that must be further processed by proteases to release mature, functional viral nsp
proteins. Two proteases within the ORF1a gene are responsible for this processing, nsp3 and
nsp5 (12). The parental ORF1a:L3352F mutation carried by 20C-US creates a mutation of

improve hydrophobic packing and enhance protein stability (16) (Fig. 3C). The more recently
acquired mutation of ORF1a:M2606I results in a mutation to the rather large nsp3 protein within
what is predicted to be the C-terminal 3Ecto or Y domain. This domain is implicated in
anchoring the replication-transcription complex (RTC) to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane
5

to facilitate interaction of nsp3 with other viral proteins on the cytosolic side (17).
ORF3a is a multifunctional protein involved in several aspects of the viral life cycle at the
surface of the cell membrane and intracellular membranes (18). ORF3a modulates the innate
immune response and apoptosis of host cells (19). The mutation G172V in ORF3a occurs within

10

a conserved di-acidic Asp-X-Glu domain (171-173) involved in trafficking to the cell membrane
(20, 21). The introduction of a valine (V) at the more variable 172 position may modulate
interactions with viral or cellular factors (22). ORF3a plays a role in viral particle maturation and
release at the cell membrane and has been proposed to co-mutate with the spike protein (23).
Substitution of serine to leucine at position 171 of ORF3a is a common mutation of the South

15

African SARS-CoV-2 variant 501Y.V2.
The 20C-US variant has also recently acquired a Q677H or a Q173K mutation in the spike
protein. Q677H is directly adjacent to the furin cleavage site. The furin cleavage site is a novel
motif not observed in SARS-CoV viruses that is proposed to significantly enhance infectivity

20

(24). Furin cleavage is a critical priming step essential for efficient entry of SARS-CoV-2 viruses
into cells (24). A mutation of interest has been the P681H in the spike protein of the novel UK
variant 501Y.V1, also due to close proximity to the furin cleavage site (5). Q677 and P681 are
mutated to histidine in 20C-US and 501Y.V1, respectively, suggesting a potentially important
effect of histidine near the furin cleavage site. The Q677 amino acid resides in a similar region

25

on the spike protein as D614, which is commonly mutated to a G residue (3) (Fig. 3D).
S:Q173K resides in the S1A domain nearby the receptor binding domain (RBD), where the wellknown E484K and N501Y mutations are found (5, 6). The S1A domain, like the RBD, exhibits
low conservation, which helps SARS-CoV-2 adapt to host cells and host immunity. Although

30

antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are believed to primarily target the RBD (25),
antibodies isolated from COVID-19 convalescent patients have been found to bind very tightly

to the S1A domain (26). Conversion from a neutral to charged amino acid might alter interactions
important for antibody recognition. In addition, N501Y and N501T mutations in the spike
protein are beginning to occur in the 20C-US variant. The significance of S:N501 mutations has
been underscored by their reoccurrence in apparently highly transmissible forms of the SARS5

CoV-2 virus (5, 6). These mutations occur in the RBD and are directly implicated in modulation
of host cell interaction (Fig. 3D).

Discussion
We have characterized the emergence and rise of a prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variant within the
10

20C clade that is highly specific to the continental U.S. 20C-US is predicted to soon surpass 50%
penetrance to become the dominant variant in the U.S. (Fig. 4A). It is unclear whether natural
selection or genetic drift has driven the rise in prevalence of 20C-US. Nonetheless, its dominance
has been largely achieved during the third pandemic wave when cases have risen significantly
(Fig. 4B). During this period, Google mobility data are consistent with no major changes in

15

population movement patterns across the U.S. that could account for an increase in the
proportion of 20C-US to other variants (Fig. 4C). Recent studies on hospital care for COVID-19
patients in the U.S. indicate that adjusted mortality rates are decreasing and patient outcomes are
improving (27, 28). Taken together, these observations suggest the possibility that 20C-US may
have some degree of increased transmissibility but not a significantly increased disease severity.

20

The biological effects of the combined 20C-US mutations, as well as the viral characteristics of
20C-US, like fitness, transmissibility, and virulence, remain to be experimentally characterized.
However, we note that all signature mutations that occurred during the establishment of the 20CUS variant lineage were non-synonymous. These include mutations to proteins involved in viral
25

replication, metabolism, and cellular exit. Importantly, one mutation, ORF1b:N1653D, occurs in
the RNA genome proofreading enzyme nsp14. 20C-US has more recently also acquired
additional mutations. Of particular interest are independently arising Q677H, Q173K, and
N501Y/T mutations in the spike protein. Q677H lies near the furin cleavage site that could
potentially alter cellular entry of virus particles. Q173K and N501Y/T reside within the N-

30

terminal S1A and RBD domains, respectively, and have the potential to alter antibody

recognition. Monitoring the fate of these mutations, as well as the potentially linked M2606I
mutation of ORF1a, within 20C-US should provide critical insight into ongoing evolutionary
processes for SARS-CoV-2 and their impact on real-world pandemic outcomes.
5

Although characterization of distinct novel SARS-CoV-2 variants has been limited up to this
point, two driving forces that may affect their rise and prevalence are the near simultaneous
acquisition of multiple mutations and limited population movement between local regions during
the pandemic. The UK variant 501Y.V1 acquired several mutations very rapidly. It has been
proposed that this founding event occurred in an immune-compromised patient where sufficient

10

pressure to continually evade the immune system was present (4). The South African variant
501Y.V2 also quickly acquired multiple mutations in the spike protein (6). Likewise, the 20CUS variant appears to have incorporated five mutations very rapidly. These events might create a
jump in fitness and a temporary disequilibrium in variant competition.

15

The mechanism and rate of SARS-CoV-2 transmission necessitates strict measures that
effectively limit population movement (29). Since the outbreak of the global COVID-19
pandemic, international travel has become highly restricted. Novel variants that emerge in an
isolated region or country may transmit locally among that population and develop distinct
genotypes and phenotypes. Thus, it would be expected that regional territories would develop

20

their own distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants over time. When searching for novel emerging variants,
focusing on local and regional data may provide an advantage. Our ability to identify the 20CUS variant can be partly attributed to our initial focus on Illinois state-level data since the
prevalence of the 20C-US variant was more pronounced in the U.S. Midwest.

25

While this manuscript was in preparation, the Nextstrain group updated their global phylogenetic
analysis server for SARS-CoV-2 to begin designating emerging clades. We found that the 20CUS variant closely tracks with the newly designated 20G clade, demonstrating that this approach
will be valuable in helping to identify new potential variants or clades of interest. When
visualized on a global geographic view, it becomes clear that variants specific to other world

30

regions have slowly emerged and gained prevalence, including the western coast of South
America (20D), Europe (20E/EU1), Australia (20F), South Africa (20H/501Y.V2), and the

United Kingdom (20I/501Y.V1) (Fig. 4D). A detailed assessment of the emergence and rise to
prevalence should also be undertaken for these variants. Unless successful vaccination efforts
can be greatly accelerated, we predict the emergence of dominant novel variants in many global
regions that are relatively isolated, possibly including Brazil, New Zealand, the African west
5

coast, and Japan.
This study underscores the need for greater genomic surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
especially at the regional level where novel variants will first emerge. Modern genomic
surveillance enables observation of evolution in near real-time, prediction of major shifts in viral

10

fitness, and assurance that vaccines are kept current.

Materials and Methods
Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 Samples
RNA extraction was performed using Mag-Bind Viral RNA XPress Kit (Omega Bio-Tek) on
15

samples received from Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) in inactivation buffer
consisting of 200 μL of sample in Viral Transport Media (VTM) and 240 μL of lysis buffer (239
μL of TNA lysis buffer and 1 μL of carrier RNA per sample). cDNA synthesis from the extracted
RNA was performed using ABI High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, following
manufacturer’s recommended protocol. SARS-CoV-2 was detected using N2 primers (Integrated

20

DNA Technologies, IDT) that target the N2 region of the nucleocapsid gene. PrimeTime Gene
Expression Master Mix (IDT) and 2 μL of cDNA was used to determine the Ct value of each
sample. Sequencing was performed with Oxford Nanopore Technology’s MinION platform using
ARTIC Network protocol (https://artic.network/ncov-2019) with slight modifications to the
protocol. Briefly, 25 μL reactions were performed for each pool using 5 μL of cDNA template and

25

4 μL of 10 μM primer pool in respective reactions. Finally, 0.5 μL of 10 mM Deoxynucleotide
(dNTP) solution mix (New England Biolabs) was added to each reaction and nuclease -free water
was used to make up the remaining reaction volume. The PCR was run by combining the annealing
and extension steps at 63°C. The thermocycler was set at 98°C for initial denaturation for 30
seconds, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 98°C for 15 seconds, annealing and extension at

30

63°C for 5 min and holding at 4°C indefinitely. From each Multiplex PCR, 5 μL of several

reactions from each pool from the batch was used to run on 1% agarose gel. The remaining 20 μL
of each pool were pooled and clean-up was performed using an equal volume of AMPure XP beads
(Beckman Coulter) and quantified using 1 μL of sample with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit on
a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. Following quantification, 60 ng of each sample was end-prepped using
5

0.75 μL of Ultra II End-Prep enzyme and 1.75 μL of Ultra II End-Prep buffer with a total volume
of 15 μL. The samples were then barcoded using the 96 native barcoding kit (Oxford Nanopore
Technology)

and

further

processed

using

the

ARTIC

Network

protocol

(https://artic.network/ncov-2019).
10

Basecalling on completed sequencing runs was performed using Guppy high accuracy model and
further demultiplexed using Guppy barcoder using strict parameters requiring barcodes to be
present at both ends. Reads were filtered based on length quality (400-700 bp) and mapped by
aligning to the MN908947.3 reference genome using minimap2. Medaka was used to create the
consensus sequence and call variants for each of the samples. The variants identified were fed into

15

longshot to produce a set of high-confidence variants.
Dataset
SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequences used in this paper that were not generated by us were acquired
from the GISAID Initiative (https://www.gisaid.org/). This dataset was updated on 2021-01-04.

20

Individual sequences were compiled by GISAID from contributions from individual labs across
the world. Their information is compiled in the supplementary section. Sequences generated by
our laboratory, currently in the process of being submitted to GISAID, were added to this
dataset. Our samples were all within the state of Illinois.

25

All sequences were evaluated through the command-line version of Nextstrain’s NextClade
software (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neherlab/nextclade) (9) to derive a list of all
nucleotide and amino-acid substitutions. 20C-US samples were then filtered from the larger
population using a criterion of necessary amino-acid mutations. Because not all sequences are
complete (contain gaps) there is the possibility of a sequence being within the 20C-US

30

population but not reporting one of the required mutations. The formula for filtering therefore
used a flexible criterion.

Phylogenetic Trees and Maps
Once appropriately filtered from the greater genomic sample pool, sample FASTA files were
used for phylogenetic inference. Briefly, the Augur pipeline utilized by Nextstrain filters
5

sequences for metadata values and N content before aligning them using MAFFT (30). As a
reference, the Nextstrain nCoV toolkit aligns SARS-CoV-2 sequences to the SARS-CoV-2
isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 complete genome (GenBank: NC_045512.2) and by default removes any
nucleotide insertions relative to this sequence. The pipeline conducts a maximum likelihood
phylogenetic analysis using the general time reversible model allowing for invariant sites and a

10

gamma distribution (GTR+I+G) in IQ-TREE (31). Augur further refines and annotates the tree in
various ways. The resulting files are combined and used by Auspice to visualize phylogenetic
relationships and geographic distributions of SARS-CoV-2 across time. For the 20C-US subset,
all samples were used. For the model of all SARS-CoV-2 variants within the United States of
America, a subset of the data was generated based on Nextstrain’s standard filtering criteria.

15

Briefly, lower-quality samples (those with large numbers of gaps or lacking sufficient metadata)
are filtered out, then the dataset is sorted based on the month it was acquired as well as the U.S.
state it was acquired in. From each of these subsets, Nextstrain attempts to randomly pick an
equal number of samples. All these samples are then recombined and processed together.
