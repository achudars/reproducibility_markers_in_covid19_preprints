Abstract
Since its emergence in Wuhan, China in late 2019, the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2
have been among the most debated issues related to COVID-19. Throughout its spread around
the world, the viral genome continued acquiring new mutations and some of them became
widespread. Among them, 14408 C>T and 23403 A>G mutations in RdRp and S, respectively,
became dominant in Europe and the US, which led to debates regarding their effects on the
mutability and transmissibility of the virus. In this study, we aimed to investigate possible
differences between time-dependent variation of mutation densities (MDe) of viral strains that
carry these two mutations and those that do not. Our analyses at the genome and gene level led
to two important findings: First, time-dependent changes in the average MDe of circulating
SARS-CoV-2 genomes showed different characteristics before and after the beginning of April,
when daily new case numbers started levelling off. Second, this pattern was much delayed or
even non-existent for the “mutant” (MT) strain that harbored both 14408 C>T and 23403 A>G
mutations. Although these differences were not limited to a few hotspots, it is intriguing that
the MDe increase is most evident in two critical genes, S and Orf1ab, which are also the genes
that harbor the defining mutations of the MT genotype. The nature of these unexpected
relationships warrant further research.

Introduction
COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is an ongoing pandemic that has been observed in
7,553,182 patients and responsible for 423,349 deaths as of 13 June 2020. It is characterized
by respiratory system problems and slow onset fever, and is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel
betacoronavirus of presumably zoonotic origin. It has first been identified in the Hubei

province of China in December 2019, with confirmed human transmission in January 20201,2,
and is currently a global concern. COVID-19 has high transmissibility3,4, a capacity of
asymptomatic cases to spread the disease5, and poses a high degree of danger to both
vulnerable individuals and the healthcare systems via such widespread and invisible
transmission6,7. Therefore, despite the disease having a current mortality rate of <6%, lower
than similar diseases caused by betacoronaviruses such as SARS or MERS, a fuller
understanding of and cure for the underlying pathogen is a high priority for researchers and
clinicians everywhere.
Soon after its spread to Europe and the US, a strain of SARS-CoV-2 with two nonsynonymous mutations in the RdRp and Spike (S) proteins, namely 14408 C>T (P323L) and
23403 A>G (D614G) became the dominant form particularly in Europe and to some extent in
the US, as well. Claims of increased transmissibility of this new strain due to D614G
mutation by Korber et al. was met with caution, as other factors such as founder effect, drift
etc. could be responsible for its dominance, as well8. Our previous study suggested that RdRp
14408 C>T mutation is associated with SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution and could even be
working synergistically with the 23403 A>G (D614G) mutation9. Although these and other
studies provided suggestive evidence that indeed this new strain could have altered
phenotypic characteristics, only after mechanistic studies are performed in cell culture and
animal models, we will be able to know whether these inferences are true. In this respect,
findings of a recent study by Zhang et al. support the increased transmissibility hypothesis for
viruses carrying the 23403 A>G mutation: authors pseudotyped retroviruses with the mutant
spike protein, infected cells in culture, and compared to those with the wild-type spike10. They
observed increased infectivity of the mutant viruses due to increased stability of the spike
protein. Other studies also pointed to the importance of the spike protein for the unique

properties of the SARS-CoV-211,12, and therefore, its mutations should probably be monitored
closely and analyzed in-depth.
In our previous study, where we analysed 11,208 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, we
showed that RdRp mutations, particularly 14408 C>T mutation, were associated with SARSCoV-2 genome evolution and higher mutation density9. In the current study, we analyzed the
time-dependent changes in the mutation densities of several SARS-CoV-2 genes and asked
whether the patterns of change were different between the strain with the 14408 C>T / 23403
A>G mutations compared to those with neither mutation.

Materials and Methods
Genome sequence filtering, retrieval, and preprocessing
SARS-CoV-2 isolate genome sequences were obtained from the GISAID EpiCoV database
and their variants were annotated as previously described9,13. Briefly, the obtained alignments
were filtered for full length genomes with high coverage and to remove environmental or nonhuman host samples. The remaining genomes were edited to mask low-quality base calls and
aligned against the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome using the MAFFT multiple sequence
alignment program. Variant sites were retrieved using snp-sites, and their effect on peptide
sequences were annotated using the ANNOVAR suite of tools. Due to the low quality and
gap-heavy content in a majority of isolates, the 5’ untranslated regions (1-265) and the 100
nucleotides at the 3’ end were also removed from analysis. In addition, we removed isolate
genomes without well-defined time of sequencing or geographical location data, to ensure the
time and location variables can be clearly associated with the mutations, for a final count of
19,705 genomes.
Mutation density calculation
The annotated variants were separated into synonymous and nonsynonymous groups, with
variants in nucleotides not located in gene loci considered synonymous. Gene mutation

densities were calculated separately for synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations, by
dividing the number of variant sites in the gene locus of an isolate by the length of the locus.
Densities for each full open reading frame, including the surface glycoprotein (S), envelope
glycoprotein (E), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), and membrane glycoprotein (M) genes
were calculated, as well as the RdRp coding region of ORF1ab and the whole genome.
Statistical Analysis
The categorical variables were analyzed with frequency tables and descriptive statistics were
used for the continuous variables. Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to examine whether
the numeric values had a normal distribution in groups. When the numeric values were not
normally distributed, Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the median values of two
independent groups. The level of significance was chosen as 0.05 in all hypothesis tests. IBM
SPSS Version 25.0 statistical package was used for statistical analyses.

Results and Discussion
14408 C>T and 23403 A>G mutations are associated with mutation density increase
over time
In order to determine whether the SARS-CoV-2 strain with 14408 C>T / 23403 A>G
mutations was different from those that carried neither mutation, with respect to timedependent changes in mutation density, first, we determined the number of synonymous and
non-synonymous mutations. The number of sites carrying mutations, after the low quality
filters were applied to isolates and the 5’ and 3’ ends, was 7870, with 16563 potential
variants. 11095 of these variants were characterized as synonymous, as they did not alter any
known peptide sequence, while 5468 of them were non-synonymous, as they either changed
amino acid residues in the translated proteins, or altered the protein length by changing start
or stop codon locations. To eliminate the bias that would be caused by the 14408 C>T and
23403 A>G mutations on the nonsynonymous mutation density of isolates they were present

in, which would be substantial considering their high frequency, these two nucleotides were
also masked during calculations of non-synonymous mutation density.
For further analysis, we focused on the two countries with the highest number of isolates
sequenced, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US), which in total contributed
58.76% of all isolates that passed the quality filters. Furthermore, we focused only on isolates
that were sequenced after the first genome with both 14408 C>T and 23403 A>G mutations
were identified in the respective geographic regions (26 February 2020 for UK, 28 February
2020 for US). Isolates that carried both of the mutations were named “mutant”, or “MT” in
short, and those that were wild-type at both positions were named “wild-type”, or “WT in
short; few isolates that carried only one of the mutations was excluded. In total, the isolates
were separated into four categories: UK-WT, UK-MT, US-WT, and US-MT.
We calculated the “average mutation density per day per genome” (hereafter referred as
mutation density, or MDe for short) for both synonymous and non-synonymous mutations in
all four categories, as well as the correlation of MDe with time, using Spearman correlation
(Fig. 1). We identified a strong positive correlation between non-synonymous MDe and time
in both UK and US in MT samples (ρ = 0.70, p-value < 0.001), however, a much weaker
correlation was observed in WT samples (ρ = 0.27, p-value = 0.002), indicating a potential
relationship between non-synonymous mutations and 14408 C>T / 23403 A>G genotype. A
similar correlation was identified for synonymous mutations in MT samples, albeit weaker
than for non-synonymous mutations (ρ = 0.64, p-value < 0.001). No significant correlation
was identified for synonymous mutations in WT samples (ρ = 0.15, p-value = 0.09). One
possible explanation for this tight correlation is that MT genomes accumulate both
synonymous and non-synonymous mutations over time, whereas WT strains show more
variation in their mutation accumulation rate.

However, closer inspection of the plots points to further differences between MT and WT
SARS-CoV-2 genomes: Rather than a monotonic change in MDe over time, certain time
points seem to be critical milestones at which the mutation densities take sharp turns. One of
them is roughly Day 100, which is defined as the 100th day following the first SARS-CoV-2
genome sequenced, and corresponds to 2 April 2020 (Fig. 1). Whereas the MDe of WT strains
keep increasing until Day 100, for both synonymous and non-synonymous, this trend is
disrupted from there on and actually a slight decrease is observed. On the other hand, albeit a
slight reduction in the strength of correlation, there is almost no change in the rate of increase
in MDe (both synonymous and non-synonymous) for the MT genomes, only a slight decrease
after Day 130 is observed. Of note, the synonymous MDe of MT genomes starts increasing
after Day 80, compared to the non-synonymous MDe, which shows a steadier increase
starting from the beginning.
The next obvious question is, “Why are there such sharp changes in MDe at certain
timepoints, particularly around Day 100 for WT and Day 80 for MT?” Even though a simple
answer is unlikely, we looked into epidemiological data for clues. Interestingly, Day 80 (13
March 2020) corresponds to the beginning of a 20-day period when daily case numbers
started increasing dramatically in both the UK and the US, and also is the day “national
emergency” was declared in the US; Day 100 (2 April 2020) roughly corresponds to the end
of this period14 (Figure S1) and the daily case numbers show a slow but steady decline after
Day 100 in both countries. It makes sense that both strains accumulated more and more
mutations as they spread fast between Days 80-100. However, it is less clear why this trend
continued only in the MT strain after Day 100, when the strict control measures slowed the
spreading of SARS-CoV-2.
Next, we determined how MT and WT strains differ at gene level, in terms of MDe. To do so,
we examined the overall distribution of mutations combined for the previously specified time

period and compared them between the MT and WT genomes (Figs. S2-3, Table S1). Only 2
(RdRp, N) of the 12 genes showed consistent differential synonymous MDe in the MT
genotype compared to the WT genotype, for UK and US. RdRp MDe was lower in the MT
genotype (Mean Rank: 104.91 vs. 40.30, p<0.001 in UK; 80.26 vs. 52.38, p-value < 0.001 in
US), whereas MDe of N gene was higher in the MT genotype (Mean Rank: 37.21 vs. 101.59,
p-value < 0.001 in UK; 54.05 vs. 77.41, p-value < 0.001 in US). Although differences were
significant in the S gene, it was in the opposite directions, higher in UK (Mean Rank: 61.13
vs. 79.93, p = 0.006) and lower in US (Mean Rank: 81.17 vs. 51.51, p-value < 0.001), for the
MT genotype. A closer look pointed to country-specific differences: While only 3 of 12 genes
showed differences in non-synonymous MDe between MT and WT genoypes for UK, this
number was much higher for US, 9 of 12 genes showed differential non-synonymous MDe.
This marked difference between the two countries is likely due to the differences in the
composition of the WT strains, which has much higher variety in the US compared to UK
owing to heavier influence of Asian SARS-CoV-2 genomes and multiple independent lines of
viral spread around the US15,16. Indeed, such differences are expected, even in the absence of
multiple founders, and justify our approach of comparing results of two countries to reach a
consensus.
As non-synonymous mutations are subject to stronger selection than synonymous mutations
and could have different patterns, we also determined possible differences in their MDe
values between MT and WT SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Only 2 (S, N) of 12 genes showed
consistent differences between the two genotypes in both countries (Table S1). MDe values in
both the S (Mean Rank: 48.88 vs. 91.03, p-value < 0.001 in UK; 58.95 vs. 72.73, p = 0.035 in
US) and N genes (Mean Rank: 34.45 vs. 104.09, p-value < 0.001 in UK; 55.52 vs. 76.01, p =
0.002 in US) were higher in the MT genotype. 3 genes (Orf1ab, Orf3a, Orf6) also showed
differences in both countries, however, in the opposite directions. In contrast to the

synonymous mutations, higher number of genes had significant differences between nonsynonymous MDe values in UK, compared to US (4 vs 2; RdRp, M, E, Orf7b vs Orf8,
Orf10); interestingly, MDe values of the MT genotype were higher in the first four and lower
in the last two, compared to WT. Overall, MDe of MT and WT genotypes at gene level
showed gene-specific and country-specific differences, while only N gene had consistent
differences for both synonymous and non-synonymous mutations in both UK and US.
Non-synonymous mutation densities increase in later samples
After characterization of MDE for the time period that MT genotype existed in the UK or US,
we next tested whether genome-level differences between MT and WT genotypes in terms of
time dependent changes in MDe are also present at gene level. Therefore, we aimed to
understand whether those differences at genome level are merely due to possible founder
effects, or due to differences between MT and WT strains’ accumulation of mutations over
time. Since Day 100 appeared to be a turning point, we divided the SARS-CoV-2 genomes
into two groups by the time of isolation: early (days 60-100) and late periods (days 101-140),
and examined the relationships between the average MDe of the two groups for each gene and
country (Figs. 2-3, Table S2). While none of the 12 genes in the WT genotype showed any
significant difference in MDe between the early and late periods consistently between UK and
US, it was the opposite for the MT genotype: S, RdRp, M, Orf1ab, and Orf3a genes showed
increased MDe in the late period compared to the early period. It was particularly evident for
the S and Orf1ab genes, as both synonymous and non-synonymous MDe in both genes were
significantly increased in the late period in both countries. Interestingly, M gene showed a
consistent decrease in the non-synonymous MDe only in the MT genomes, against the
common trend of increased MDe in this genotype; however, no such association was observed
for the synonymous MDe, it was even the opposite in the UK-MT isolates. On the other hand,
the RdRp non-synonymous MDe was increased significantly in the late period in UK-MT

isolates, and trended towards increase in US-MT isolates (Mean Rank: 29.76 vs. 38.64, pvalue = 0.058); RdRp non-synonymous MDe was also increased in late period UK-MT
isolates, however, there was no such increase in the US isolates, consistent with timeindependent MDe values (Figure S2), and with the marginally insignificant increase in
synonymous MDe in the same isolates. Among changes that were significant for a singlecountry, there was an overall tendency towards increased MDe in MT genomes, but the
opposite was true for WT genomes: 12/14 of single-country changes in MT genomes were
associated with increased MDe, whereas 12/16 of such changes in WT genomes were
associated with decreased MDe in different genes. These findings suggest that the steady
increase in MDe specific to MT isolates even after Day 100 cannot simply be explained by
founder effects, or linkage. One could speculate that at least some of the WT strains
accumulated mutations that reduced their fitness under lock-down conditions and therefore
led to their elimination in the late period (101-140 days), whereas the MT strain was fit
enough to keep most or all mutations and even add new ones in this period. However, almost
equal contribution of synonymous and non-synoymous mutations may point to other factors
in addition to possible differences in fitness. Although S and Orf1ab genes seem to be the
main drivers of the obverved genome-wide increase the MDe of MT genomes, it seems that
other genes are also contributing to this trend.
Isolates with 14408 C>T & 23403 A>G mutations (MT genotype) show steady increase
in mutations in both S and RdRp over time
To further investigate whether the shift in MDe happens due to a few distinct sites that are
linked with the MT mutations, and could possibly directly affect the host adaptation process,
or whether it is caused by a variety of mutations that spread widely both temporally and
spatially in the genome, we further divided the early and late time periods into a total of four
periods (60-80, 81-100, 101-120, 121-140), and analyzed the distributions of mutations in the

S and RdRp coding regions in these four time periods (Figs. 4, S4-5). To do so, we calculated
the number of mutations in 100-nucleotide bins per isolate sharing a genotype (MT or WT) in
that each time period, and observed their distributions, divided into two groups as
synonymous and non-synonymous mutations. We can see that in the 60-80 day period, the
distribution of mutations across the regions were largely comparable between WT and MT
genomes, with the exception of the synonymous 14805 C>T mutation in the RdRp, which is
exclusive to WT isolates (Fig. 4A). The ratio of mutations in MT to WT steadily increase over
time in both synonymous and non-synonymous categories and in both UK and US (Figs. S45), with MT genome mutations more visible in most bins in the 121-140 day period, with the
major exception of the 14805 C>T mutation being preserved in WT isolates (Fig. 4B). 100nucleotide binned totals and the mutated isolate ratios for all sites in the regions are available
in sheet 1 and 2 of Supplementary File, respectively. These observations suggest that the
increase in MDe in MT isolates is due to overall increased number of nucleotides in the
genome becoming mutated over time, rather than increased frequency of certain genotypes
with higher MDe. Although it is unclear whether the 14805 C>T synonymous mutation has
any stabilizing effect on the WT MDe, its high frequency in WT isolates is more likely to be
the result of a founder effect, rather than any selection.

Conclusions
Our results point to an unexpected relationship between the SARS-CoV-2 mutation densities
and viral transmission dynamics at population level in humans. While the average mutation
densities increased steadily by time during the fast-spreading period of COVID-19 in both
countries, this trend ended around Day 100 (2 April 2020), when daily new case numbers
started reaching a plateau. It seems, however, that not all strains of SARS-CoV-2 are affected
equally by the epidemiological factors (i.e. counter-measures that led to reduced daily new
case numbers in UK and US, host factors, treatment regimens, etc.), in terms of mutation

densities. SARS-CoV-2 strain with both RdRp 14408 C>T and S 23403 A>G mutations,
which became dominant in Europe and US first, differed and continued accumulating both
synonymous and non-synonymous mutations after Day 100, particularly in the S and Orf1a
genes. Therefore, two related questions remain to be answered: 1) Is there any causal
relationship between mutation density changes and viral transmission in population? If the
answer is ‘yes’, what is the nature of this relationship? 2) What is the biological basis of
differences between the ‘mutant’ and ‘wild-type’ strains, if there is any? It is intriguing that
the main drivers of the genome-level increase in MDe were two critical genes, S and Orf1a,
which are also the genes that harbor the defining mutations of the MT genotype.
It should also be noted that the MDe of the MT genomes started showing signs of decline
after Day 130 (2 May 2020), although no obvious change in the epidemiological data is seen
around this date. Further studies are warranted that will investigate the relationship between
mutations and the clinical phenotypes, as more data will become widely available.
In conclusion, we propose that monitoring the average mutation densities over time and
relating to the epidemiological and clinical data may help establish genotype/phenotype
relations, and possibly predict the increases and decreases in new cases.

Figure Legends
Figure 1. Mutation density has a strong correlation with time in isolates carrying both
14408 C>T and 23403 A>G mutations. The top two scatter plots show the distribution of
average synonymous mutations per day, while the bottom two show the same distribution for
non-synonymous mutations. The left two plots have the reference nucleotide in base 14408 and
23403, and the right two plots have the mutations of interest in both bases. Red dots indicate
average density of samples from the UK, blue dots indicate the average density of US samples.
The correlation coefficients are calculated using Spearman correlation using the combined sets
of both countries.

Figure 2. Synonymous mutation density rates do not shift significantly between early
and late periods when comparing WT and MT samples. The boxplots show the
synonymous mutation density of UK-WT, UK-MT, US-WT, and US-MT samples divided
into early period (60-100 days) and late period (101-140 days) , with gray bars indicating
early period samples, and orange bars indicating late period samples. The average mutation
density per day is calculated in average nucleotides mutated per gene locus across all isolates.
Mutations in the RdRp coding regions are included in both the RdRp plot and the Orf1ab plot.
Figure 3. MT samples display higher non-synonymous mutation density increases in late
period compared to WT samples. The boxplots show the non-synonymous mutation density
of UK-WT, UK-MT, US-WT, and US-MT samples divided into early period (60-100 days)
and late period (101-140 days), with gray bars indicating early period samples, and orange
bars indicating late period samples. The average mutation density per day is calculated in
average nucleotides mutated per gene locus across all isolates. Mutations in the RdRp coding
regions are included in both the RdRp plot and the Orf1ab plot.
Figure 4. Mutation densities in MT isolates increase more rapidly compared to WT
isolates after first identified MT genome. A) Barplots for isolates in the 60-80 day time
period. B) Barplots for isolates in the 121-140 day time period. The barplots show 100
nucleotide long bins indicating regions on the genome in the x-axis, and the total number of
isolates with mutations in the indicated regions in the y-axis, with green bars indicating WT
isolates and orange bars indicating MT isolates. The top two barplots for each subfigure
indicate synonymous mutations, with the bottom two indicating non-synonymous mutations.
The left barplots show the RdRp coding region, while the right barplots show the S gene.
