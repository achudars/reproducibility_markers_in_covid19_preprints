Abstract
There is a great need for the development of vaccines for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and
mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we developed two modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)
based vaccines which express either a membrane anchored full-length spike protein (MVA/S)
stabilized in a prefusion state or the S1 region of the spike (MVA/S1) which forms trimers and is
secreted. Both immunogens contained the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which is a known
target of antibody-mediated neutralization. Following immunizations with MVA/S or MVA/S1, both
spike protein recombinants induced strong IgG antibodies to purified full-length SARS-CoV-2
spike protein. The MVA/S induced a robust antibody response to purified RBD, S1 and S2
whereas MVA/S1 induced an antibody response to the S1 region outside of the RBD region. Both
vaccines induced an antibody response in the lung and that was associated with induction of
bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue. MVA/S but not MVA/S1 vaccinated mice generated robust
neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 that strongly correlated with RBD antibody
binding titers. Mechanistically, S1 binding to ACE-2 was strong but reduced following prolonged
pre-incubation at room temperature suggesting confirmation changes in RBD with time. These
results demonstrate MVA/S is a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction
The novel SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has recently emerged as a pandemic
across the world. As of June 24, 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 9.3 million people
and over 479,000 people have succumbed to COVID-19, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of a vaccine that can rapidly induce anti-viral
immunity and prevent infection. Previous data from other related coronavirus infections such as
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV demonstrated that a strong neutralizing antibody response against
the spike protein can effectively prevent infection (1-4). Consistent with this, recent studies used
DNA, mRNA and chimp adenovirus-based vaccines expressing full length spike as an
immunogen and showed induction of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (5-9).
Encouragingly, some of these studies showed protection from disease either in small animals or
in rhesus macaques. Emerging data from COVID-19 patients and animal studies show a strong
association between antibody response targeted to receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S1
region of the S protein and neutralizing activity suggesting that COVID-19 vaccines should aim to
target antibody response to RBD (10).
Modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is a highly attenuated strain of vaccinia virus. The safety,
immunogenicity, and protective capacity of the replication-deficient MVA has been wellestablished and has been widely used for developing vaccines against infectious diseases and
cancer in preclinical research and humans (11, 12). There are several advantages to MVA-based
vaccines. 1) They are safe and well-tolerated including in HIV infected individuals (13). 2) They
induce robust antibody responses after a single vaccination and can be boosted at least 10-fold
with a second dose (14-18). 3) MVA vaccine-induced antibody responses in humans are durable
with little contraction over a 6 month timeframe (16). 4) MVA can be delivered through multiple
routes and can be used to generate a mucosal antibody response. 5) MVA can accommodate
large inserts (>10kb) that will allow expression of multiple antigens in a single vector. 6) MVA
vectored recombinants are stable and can be produced at high titer enabling ease of vaccine
manufacturing. 7) MVA vaccines can induce CD4 and CD8 T cell responses important for
protection against some viral infections (14). 8) MVA-based vaccines have been shown to protect
against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Zika virus and Ebola virus (4, 17-19).
In this study, we developed two modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) based vaccines which express
either a membrane anchored full-length spike protein (MVA/S) stabilized in a prefusion state or
the S1 region of the spike (MVA/S1) which forms trimers and is secreted. Both immunogens
contained the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which is a known target of antibody-mediated
neutralization. The MVA/S also incorporated two mutations that have been shown to maintain the
spike protein in a prefusion confirmation (20, 21). Using a mouse model, we evaluated the
antibody responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein following immunization with these two
MVA-based vaccines.
Results:
The MVA vaccines express high levels of full-length stabilized spike and trimeric soluble
S1 proteins
To develop the MVA recombinants we synthesized the full-length spike gene (amino acids 11273) with stabilizing mutations (K986P, V987P) or the S1 region with a small portion of S2 region
(amino acids 14 to 780). To promote active secretion of the S1, we replaced the first 14 amino
acids of the spike sequence with the signal sequence from GM-CSF (Fig. 1A). Both sequences
were optimized for MVA codon usage, corrected for poxvirus transcription termination sequences
and cloned into pLW73 vector that will allow us to insert the recombinant sequences under mH5
promoter in the essential region of MVA. The recombinants were selected as described previously

and characterized for protein expression by flow cytometry and Western blotting. As expected,
the MVA/S expressed high levels of spike on the cell surface (Fig. 1B) and the expressed protein
had a molecular mass of about 180 kDa (Fig. 1C). Similarly, the MVA/S1 was expressed
intracellularly (Fig. 1B), and a molecular mass of about 114 kDA was also secreted into the
supernatants (Fig. 1C). The spike protein expressed by MVA/S on the surface seemed folded
correctly based on strong binding to ACE2 (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, the S1 protein was found to
form trimers based on gel filtration profile and native-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1E).
Both MVA/S and MVA/S1 vaccines induce a strong binding antibody response but with
different specificities
We immunized Balb/c mice with MVA/S or MVA/S1 on weeks 0 and 4, and measured binding
antibody responses to total and different parts of spike i.e. RBD, S1, and S (S) using ELISA at 2
weeks post prime and boost (Fig. 2). While both vaccines induced a strong binding antibody
response to S, they differentially targeted binding to RBD and S1 (Fig. 2A, 2B). The MVA/S sera
showed binding to RBD whereas MVA/S1 sera showed binding to S1. This was interesting
considering that S1 protein includes the RBD region and suggests that antibody binding in sera
from MVA/S1-vaccinated mice may be targeting regions outside of the RBD. We also performed
Luminex assay using sera obtained 3 weeks post-boost to measure binding to different parts of
S including S2, and to determine the antibody subclass and their ability to bind different soluble
FcgRs (Fig. 2C). These analyses revealed that MVA/S-vaccinated mice generated an antibody
response that showed similar binding to the RBD, S1 and S2 purified proteins whereas serum
from MVA/S1-vaccinated mice primarily generated an antibody response that bound to the nonRBD portion of the S1 (Fig. 2C). While the lack of binding to S2 is expected, poor binding to RBD
was not expected. Analysis of IgG subclass and FcgR binding of RBD-specific antibody showed
strong IgG2a response (Th1 biased) and binding to all three FcgRs tested with strongest binding
to FcgR2 and FcgR4 in the MVA/S group (Fig. 2D). In contrast, poor binding of RBD-specific
antibody was observed in general with MVA/S1 sera. However, the S1-specific antibody showed
similar results in both groups. These results demonstrated differential targeting of spike specific
antibody with Th1 profile induced by MVA/S and MVA/S1 vaccines.
MVA vaccination induces strong bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue and antibody
responses in the lung
We next studied if vaccination induced immune responses in the lung, a primary site of SARSCoV-2 virus exposure. We measured the formation of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue
(BALT)(22, 23) using the immunohistochemistry at 3 weeks after the MVA boost by staining for B
and T cells (Fig. 3A, 3B). As expected, the naïve mice showed very little or no BALT, however,
the MVA vaccinated mice showed significant induction of BALT indicating the generation of local
lymphoid tissue. While we do not know the longevity of persistence of these BALT, they are
expected to help with rapid expansion of immunity in the lung following exposure to SARS-CoV2 infection (22, 24). Consistent with BALT, we also observed the induction of spike specific IgG
responses in the BAL (Fig. 3C). Similar to serum, the RBD-specific IgG responses were higher in
the MVA/S group compared to MVA/S1 group. These results demonstrate strong induction of
antibody responses in the lung following MVA vaccination.
MVA/S but not MVA/S1 induces strong neutralizing antibody response
We next evaluated the neutralization capacity of serum from MVA-vaccinated mice using SARSCoV-2. Using serum from 2 weeks post-boost (Fig. 4A), we performed an FRNT-mNG assay.
Impressively, we observed a robust neutralizing antibody response in sera from mice vaccinated
with MVA/S that ranged from 20-900 with a median of 200 (Fig. 4B). In contrast, we did not
observe any detectable neutralization activity in sera from mice immunized with MVA/S1. This

was despite the fact that MVA/S1 mice showed comparable or higher binding antibody response
to RBD, S1 and S proteins. The neutralization titer correlated directly with the RBD binding titer
and negatively correlated with the S1 binding titer (Fig. 4C). In particular, they correlated with the
RBD or S specific IgG2a binding titer (Fig. 4D). These results demonstrated that MVA/S
immunogen can induce a strong neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 and could
serve as a potential vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, they also reveal that MVA/S1 is not a
good vaccine as it failed to induce a neutralizing antibody response.
SARS-CoV-2 S1 exhibits lower affinity to ACE2 than RBD, which further weakens upon
preincubation at 25oC
To further understand the failure of MVA/S1 vaccine to induce strong RBD binding antibody and
neutralizing antibody, we purified the S1 trimer protein expressed by MVA/S1 vaccine and
determined its ability to bind to human ACE-2 using biolayer interferometry (BLI)(Fig. 5). We used
purified RBD protein as a benchmark. SARS-CoV-2 S1 bound to hu-ACE2 quite strongly but at
2-fold lower affinity than RBD (KD = 70.1nM and 36nM respectively, Fig. 5A, 5B). S1 exhibited
10-fold lower association rate than RBD (kon 1.1E+04 and 1.3E+05 1/Ms respectively). However,
the affinity of S1-ACE2 further decreased by 5-fold when the protein was incubated at 25oC for
60 min. In contrary, RBD was stable and retained its affinity (KD = 24nM). The data indicated the
receptor binding domain of S1 to be unstable, thereby loosing association with ACE2 protein upon
prolonged incubation at room temperature, unlike RBD. We observed 10-fold reduction in the
association rate for S1-ACE2, compared to RBD which was meagerly affected.
Discussion
Our results comparing two versions of MVA vaccines expressing either the full length prefusion
stabilized spike or secreted S1 demonstrated that while both immunogens induce strong binding
antibody response to spike only the former induces a strong neutralizing antibody response
against the SARS-CoV-2. The failure of MVA/S1 immunogen to induce neutralizing activity was
associated with its failure to induce antibody to RBD. This was surprising given the fact that RBD
is part of S1. Binding to ACE-2 revealed that S1 presents RBD in the proper confirmation however
the stability of RBD binding to its receptor seems to decrease markedly during prolonged
incubation at the room temperature. This instability of S1 protein seems to contribute to induction
of strong binding antibody to other regions in S1 other than RBD following immunization. Further
studies are needed to understand the binding specificity of antibodies induced by these two
vaccines. Importantly, systemic MVA vaccination also induced T cell and antibody responses in
the lung that will be critical for protection against respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2. Our
previous studies with MVA using HIV recombinants showed that MVA immunogenicity is durable
and comparable in mice, non-human primates and humans except that we will need 10 times
higher dose in NHPs and humans compared to mice (16, 25). This accounts for a dose of about
108 pfu and this dose is achievable by large scale manufacture. Collectively these results
demonstrate that MVA/S could serve as a potential vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.

Methods
Generation of recombinant MVAs expressing SARS-CoV 2 spike antigens. For MVA/S, the
3821-nt ORF encoding the SARS-nCoV Spike gene was codon optimized for vaccinia virus
expression, synthesized (GenScript), and cloned into pLW-73 (provided by B. Moss and L. Wyatt,
National Institutes of Health) using the XmaI and BamH1site under the control of the vaccinia
virus modified H5 early late promoter and adjacent to the gene encoding enhanced GFP (green
fluorescent protein) regulated by the vaccinia virus P11 late promoter. Similarly, to develop
MVA/S1, spike secreted monomeric form, GmCSF signal sequence followed with Spike DNA
sequence of 14-780 AA was synthesized and cloned between Xma1 and BamH1 sites of pLW73 vector. These plasmid DNAs were subsequently used to generate recombinant MVAs by
transfecting transfer plasmids into DF-1 cells that were infected with 0.05 plaque forming units
(pfu) of MVA per cell as described previously into the essential region of MVA 1974 strain between
genes I8R and G1L (26). Recombinant MVAs (rMVA) were isolated using standard methods. The
expression of spike on the MVA-infected cells from MVA/S construct was determined using antiSARS-CoV-2 spike antibody (Cat #135356, GeneTex). For MVA/S1, anti SARS-CoV-2 RBD
antibody (Cat# 40592-T62, Sino Biological) was used to stain intracellularly. Plaques were picked
for 7 rounds to obtain GFP-negative recombinants and DNA was sequenced to confirm there are
no mutations. Viral stocks were purified from lysates of infected DF-1 cells using a 36% sucrose
cushion and titrated using DF-1 cells by counting pfu/ml. Absence of wildtype MVA was confirmed
by PCR using recombinant specific primers flanking the inserts, and by flow cytometry by staining
for MVA and spike.
Flow staining for Spike expression. DF-1 cells were infected with MVA/S or MVA/S1 at 1 pfu
per cell and cells were stained after 36h of infection. MVA/S infected cells were harvested, stained
with live dead marker and anti SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody (#GTX135356, GeneTex) followed by
donkey anti-rabbit IgG coupled to PE ( # 406421, BioLegend) on the surface. Cells were then
fixed with Cytofix/cytoperm (BD Pharmingen), permeabilized with permwash (BD Pharmingen),
and intracellularly stained for MVA using mouse monoclonal anti-Vaccinia virus E3L Ab (#NR4547 BEI Resources) coupled to PacBlue. MVA/S1 infected cells were stained for live dead
marker, fixed, permeabilized and intracellularly stained for S1 protein using SARS-CoV-2 RBD
Ab (#40592-T62, SinoBiological), followed by sequentially with donkey anti Rabbit PE and anti Vaccinia virus E3L Ab. Spike and MVA double positive cells were shown on live cells. Similarly
human ACE2 binding to surface expressed spike on MVA/S infected DF-1 cells was done using
biotinylated human ACE2 protein (#10108-H08H-B, Sino Biological) followed by streptavidin-PE
(BD Pharmingen) and intracellularly for MVA as described earlier.
Protein expression and purification. RBD-His and S1 proteins were produced in Amara
laboratory by transfecting HEK293 cells using plasmids pCAGGS-RBD-His and pGA8-S1,
respectively. The RBD-His plasmid was obtained from BEI resources (Cat# NR-52309). The
pGA8-S1 plasmid was generated by cloning human codon-optimized S1 DNA sequence from
amino acids 14-780 with GM-CSF signal sequence under the control of CMV promoter with intron
A. Transfections were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fischer).
Briefly, HEK 293F cells were seeded at a density of 2x106 cells/ml in Expi293 expression medium
and incubated in an orbital shaking incubator at 37°C and 127 rpm with 8% CO2 overnight. Next
day, 2.5x106 cells/ml were transfected using ExpiFectamineTM 293 transfection reagent
(ThermoFisher, cat. no. A14524) as per manufacturer’s protocol. The cells were grown for 72hrs
at 37°C,127 rpm, 8% CO2. The cells were harvested and spun at 2,000g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
The supernatant was filtered using a 0.22 µm stericup filter (Themofischer, cat.no. 290-4520),
and loaded onto pre-equilibrated affinity column for protein purification. The SARS-CoV-2 RBDHis tag and S1 proteins were purified using Ni-NTA resin (Thermofischer, cat.no. 88221) and

Agarose bound Galanthus Nivalis Lectin (GNL) (Vector Labs, cat. no. AL-1243-5) respectively.
Briefly, His-Pur Ni-NTA resin was washed with fresh PBS by centrifugation at 2000g for 10 min.
The resin was resuspended with the supernatant and incubated for 2 hours on a shaker at RT.
Polypropylene column was loaded with the supernatant-resin mixture and then washed with wash
Buffer (25mM Imidazole, 6.7mM NaH2PO4.H2O and 300mM NaCl in PBS) four times, after which
the protein was eluted in elution buffer (235mM Imidazole, 6.7mM NaH2PO4.H2O and 300mM
NaCl in PBS). S1 protein supernatants were mixed with GNL-resin, overnight on rocker at 4oC.
The supernatant-resin mix was loaded on to the column and washed 3 times with PBS and eluted
using 1M methyl- α-D mannopyranoside, pH7.4. Protein elutions were dialysed against PBS using
Slide-A-lyzer Dialysis Cassette (ThermoScientific, cat no. 66030), concentrated using 10 kDa
Amicon Centrifugal Filter Units (for RBD) or 50 kDa Amicon Centrifugal Filter Units (for S1) at
2000g at 4°C. The concentrated protein elutes were run on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL
(GE Healthcare) column on an AktaTMPure (GE Healthcare) system to collect the peaks of
interest. The eluted peaks of interest were pooled. The concentration was estimated by BCA
Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). The purity of the protein was confirmed by BN-PAGE (NuPAGE™, 412% Bis-Tris Protein Gels, ThermoScientific), SDS PAGE and Western blot.
Western Blotting. DF-1 cells were infected with 1 MOI of recombinant MVA/S or MVA/S1 for 36
h. Infected cells were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer and supernatants were collected. Lysates were
kept on ice for 10 min, centrifuged, and resolved by SDS PAGE using precast 4–15% SDS
polyacrylamide gels (BioRad). Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked
with 1% casein blocker overnight (Cat#1610782 Biorad), and incubated for 1 h at room
temperature with anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike mouse mAb (Cat # GTX632604, GeneTex) for MVA/S
and rabbit SARS-CoV-2 RBD polyclonal antibody (Cat# 40592-T62, Sino Biological) for MVA/S1
diluted 1:2500 in blocking buffer, respectively. The membrane was washed in PBS containing
Tween-20 (0.05%) and was incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse
or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Southern Biotech) diluted 1:20,000 accordingly. The
membranes were washed, and proteins were visualized using the ECL select chemiluminescence
substrate (Cat# RPN2235 GEhealthcare).
Animal immunizations and sample collection. BALB/c mice were obtained from Jackson
Laboratories (Willmington, MA, USA) and were housed in the animal facility at the YNPRC of
Emory University, Atlanta, GA. All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee of the Emory University. Briefly, 6–8-week-old female BALB/c mice
(n=5) were immunized with 10^7 plaque-forming-units (pfu) of rMVA/S or rMVA/S1 by
intramuscular (i.m.) route on weeks 0 and 3. Blood samples were collected by facial vein puncture
in BD Microtainer® Tube at two weeks after each immunization for analyzing serum antibody
responses. At three weeks after the boost, animals were euthanized using CO2 followed by
cervical dislocation. Blood, lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were collected. A small
piece of lung was used for IHC staining.
Measurement of binding antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
These were performed as described previously (27). Briefly, Nunc high-binding ELISA plates
(Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA, USA) were coated with 2 µg/ml of recombinant SARSCoV-2 proteins (S1 and RBD-His proteins were produced in the lab and S1 + S2 ECD spike
protein was purchased from Sino Biologicals) in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS)
and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Plates were then blocked with 5% blotting-grade milk powder
(Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) and 4% whey powder (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) in DPBS with
0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature (RT). Plates were then incubated with serial dilutions
of mouse sera for 2 h at RT, washed 6 times and then incubated with 1: 6000 dilution of
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Southern

Biotech; Birmingham, AL, USA) for 1 h at RT. The plates were washed and developed using TMB
(2-Component Microwell Peroxidase Substrate Kit, SeraCare's Reagents; Milford, MA, USA) and
the reaction was stopped using 1N Sulfuric acid solution. Plates were read at 450 nm wavelength
within 30 min using ELISA plate reader (Molecular Devices; San Jose, CA, USA). ELISA endpoint
titers were defined as the highest reciprocal serum dilution that yielded an absorbance >2-fold
over background values.
Measurement of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Infectious clone of the full-length
mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV/USA_WA1/2020) was generated as previously
described (28). The stock virus was passaged twice (P2) and viral titers were determined by
plaque assay on Vero E6 cells (ATCC). Vero cells were cultured in complete DMEM medium
consisting of 1x DMEM (Corning Cellgro), 10% FBS, 25mM HEPES Buffer (Corning Cellgro),
2mM L-glutamine, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 1x Non-essential Amino Acids, and 1x antibiotics.
Mouse sera from vaccinated animals and naive animals were heat inactivated for 30 min at 56 °C.
Heat-inactivated serum was serially diluted in duplicate three-fold starting at a 1:20 dilution in a
96-well round-bottom plate and incubated between 400-600 FFU of ic-SARS-CoV-2-mNG for 1 h
at 37°C. This antibody-virus mixture was transferred into the wells of a 96-well plate that had been
seeded the previous day at 2.5× 104 cells per well. After 1 hour, the antibody-virus inoculum was
removed and 0.85% methylcellulose in 2% FBS containing cDMEM was overlaid onto the cell
monolayer. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 24-28 hours. Cells were washed three times with
1x PBS (Corning Cellgro) and fixed with 125 µl of 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy
Sciences) for 30 minutes. Following fixation, plates were washed twice with 1x PBS and imaged
on an ELISPOT reader (CTL Analyzer). Foci were counted using Viridot (counted first under the
green light setting followed by background subtraction under the red light setting) (29). FRNT50
curves were generated by non-linear regression analysis using the 4PL sigmoidal dose curve
equation on Prism 8 (Graphpad Software). Neutralization titers were calculated as 100% x [1(average foci in duplicate wells incubated with mouse serum) ÷ (average number of foci in the
duplicate wells incubated at the highest dilution of the respective mouse serum)].
Immunohistochemistry and Confocal microscopy. Tissue imaging of optimum cutting
temperature (OCT) compound embedded lung tissue sections was performed. Fresh lung tissues
from vaccinated and control mice were fixed in 4% PFA for 60 minutes at RT followed by overnight
30% sucrose treatment. Next day, the tissues are embedded in OCT compound and and snap frozen.
10-micron thick tissue sections were taken from Frozen OCT blocks and adhered to highly adhesive
glass slides. Tissue sections were immediately fixed in 30% PFA and 70% acetone fixative cocktail.
Fixed tissue sections were subjected to blocking with 5% BSA in PBS supplemented with 2% goat
serum and 0.025% Tritox-100 for 1h at RT. After three washes with chilled PBS, tissue sections were
subjected to overnight incubation with primary antibodies in 1% BSA and 0.025% Triton-100
supplemented PBS. For investigating the formation of iBALT B cell and T cells were stained in lungs
using primary antibody cocktail containing rat anti-mouse CD45R/B220 (BioLegend, Cat#103202)
and Hamster anti mouse CD3 (BD, Cat#550277) antibodies. and incubated overnight at 4 degree
Celsius. Next day, primary antibodies were washed off the slides thrice using chilled PBS followed by
incubation with secondary antibodies for 1h at RT. Secondary antibodies cocktail contained goat antirat IgG-Alexa488 (abcam, Cat#ab150157) and goat anti-hamster IgG-Alexa546 (Thermofisher,
Cat#A21111). Slides were washed thrice with chilled PBS and mounted using anti-fade mounting
media containing DAPI to stain nucleus. The slides were imaged by Olympus FV1000 confocal

Systems serology by Luminex analysis. For relative quantification of antigen-specific antibody
titers, a customized multiplexed approach was applied, as previously described (30). Therefore,
magnetic microspheres with a unique fluorescent signature (Luminex) were coupled with SARS-

CoV-2 antigens including spike protein (S) (provided by Eric Fischer, Dana Farber), Receptor
Binding Domain (RBD), and CoV HKU1 RBD (provided by Aaron Schmidt, Ragon Institute), CoV2 S1 and S2 (Sino Biologicals) as well as influenza as control (Immune Tech). Coupling was
performed using EDC (Thermo Scientific) and Sulfo-NHS (Thermo Scientific) to covalently couple
antigens to beads. 1.2´103 beads per region/ antigen were added to a 384-well plate (Greiner),
and incubated with diluted plasma samples (1:90 for all readouts) for 16h shaking at 900rmp at
4°C to facilitate immune complex formation. The next day, immune complexed microspheres were
washed three times in 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 using an automated magnetic plate
washer (Tecan). Anti-mouse IgG-, IgG2a-, IgG3-, IgA- and IgM-PE coupled (Southern Biotech)
detection antibodies were diluted in Luminex assay buffer to 0.65ug/ml. Beads and detection
antibody were incubated for 1h at RT while shaking at 900rpm. Following washing of stained
immune complexes, a tertiary goat anti-mouse IgG-PE antibody (Southern Biotech) was added
and incubated for 1h at RT on a shaker. To asses Fc-receptor binding, mouse Fc-receptor FcgR2,
FcgR3, FcgR4 (Duke Protein Production facility) were biotinylated (Thermo Scientific) and
conjugated to Streptavidin-PE for 10 min (Southern Biotech) before adding to immune complexes.
Finally, beads were washed and acquired on a flow cytometer, iQue (Intellicyt) with a robot arm
(PAA). Events were gated on each bead region, median fluorescence of PE for bead positive
events was reported. Samples were run in duplicate for each secondary detection agent.
Binding kinetics by Bio-layer Interferometry (BLI). The assay was done in 384 well format on
Octet Red384 platform, Pall ForteBio. Fc-human ACE2 (Acro Biosystems, catalogue no AC2H5257) was immobilized onto anti-human Fc coated biosensors at 5µg/ml. The purified SARSCoV-2 protein (S1, RBD) was used as analyte (800nM-12.5nM). The analyte was incubated at
25oC for either 0min and 60min before running the experiment. Protein-ACE2 association (kon)
was monitored for 300s, followed by dissociation (kdis) for 600s. 10X Kinetics Buffer, Pall ForteBio
was used as buffer for all steps and dilutions in the assay. KD (dissociation constant = kdis/kon) was
estimated by globally fitting the reference (buffer only) subtracted sensograms to a 1:1 binding
model using ForteBio Data analysis v9 software.
Data analysis and statistical procedures. GraphPad Prism v7.0 was used to perform data
analysis and statistics. A Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used to compare between Naïve,
MVA/S and MVA/S1 vaccination groups. P value of <0.05 was considered significant. The
correlation analysis was performed using Spearman rank test.
