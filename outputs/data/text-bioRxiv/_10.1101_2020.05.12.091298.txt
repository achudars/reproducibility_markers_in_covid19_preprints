ABSTRACT

23

B cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 S envelope glycoprotein spike were isolated from a

24

COVID-19-infected subject using a stabilized spike-derived ectodomain (S2P) twenty-one

25

days post-infection. Forty-four S2P-specific monoclonal antibodies were generated, three

26

of which bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD). The antibodies were minimally

27

mutated from germline and were derived from different B cell lineages. Only two

28

antibodies displayed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus. The most

29

potent antibody bound the RBD in a manner that prevented binding to the ACE2 receptor,

30

while the other bound outside the RBD. Our study indicates that the majority of antibodies

31

against the viral envelope spike that were generated during the first weeks of COVID-19

32

infection are non-neutralizing and target epitopes outside the RBD. Antibodies that disrupt

33

the SARS-CoV-2 spike-ACE2 interaction can potently neutralize the virus without

34

undergoing extensive maturation. Such antibodies have potential preventive/therapeutic

35

potential and can serve as templates for vaccine-design.

IN BRIEF

51

SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to expansion of diverse B cells clones against the viral spike

52

glycoprotein (S). The antibodies bind S with high affinity despite being minimally mutated.

53

Thus, the development of neutralizing antibody responses by vaccination will require the

54

activation of certain naïve B cells without requiring extensive somatic mutation.

INTRODUCTION

61

The WHO declared the 2020 COVID-19 to be a global pandemic on March 11th, 2020

62

(World Health Organization, 2020). There are currently 4.2 million documented cases of

63

COVID-19 and over 290 000 deaths (Dong et al., 2020). The infection is caused by SARS-

64

CoV-2, a beta coronavirus, closely related to SARS-CoV (Wan et al., 2020). Presently the

65

immune response to COVID-19 is not well understood and preventative measures, such

66

as vaccines, are not available. It is also unclear which immune responses are required to

67

prevent or control SARS CoV-2 infection.

68

High resolution structures of the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized spike (S) ectodomain

69

revealed that it adopts multiple conformations with either one receptor binding domain

70

(RBD) in the “up” or “open” conformation or all RBDs in the “down” or “closed”

71

conformation, similar to previous reports on both SARS-CoV S and MERS-CoV S (Gui et

72

al., 2017; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018; Walls et al.,

73

2020; Walls et al., 2019; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2017). Like SARS-CoV, SARS-

74

CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an entry receptor binding with

75

nM affinity (Li et al., 2003; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) (Hoffmann et al., 2020;

76

Letko et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020). Indeed, the S proteins of the two viruses share a high

77

degree of amino acid sequence homology; 76% overall and 74% in RBD (Wan et al.,

78

2020).

79

Although binding and neutralizing antibody responses are known to develop following

80

SARS-CoV-2 infection (Ni et al.; Okba et al., 2020), no information is currently available

81

on the epitope specificities, clonality, binding affinities and neutralizing potentials of the

82

antibody response.

83

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from SARS-CoV-infected subjects can recognize

84

the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Yuan et al., 2020) and immunization with SARS S protein

85

can elicit anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in wildtype, and humanized mice, as

86

well as llamas (Walls et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). However, SARS-

87

CoV-2 infection appears to not elicit strong anti-SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody

88

responses and vice versa (Ou et al., 2020).

89

Here, we employed diverse but complementary approaches to investigate the serum

90

binding and neutralizing antibody responses to a stabilized ectodomain variant of the

91

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S2P)as well as the frequency and clonality of S2P-specifc B

92

cells in a SARS-CoV-2-infected individual 21 days post post the onset of respiratory

93

symptoms. We isolated anti-SARS-CoV-2 S mAbs and characterized their binding

94

properties and determined their neutralizing potencies. Among all B cells analyzed, no

95

particular VH or VL gene family was expanded and the isolated antibodies were minimally

96

mutated. Our analysis reveals that only a small fraction of S2P-specific B cells recognized

97

the RBD. Of the forty-four mAbs analyzed, only two displayed neutralizing activity. The

98

most potent mAb, CV30, bound the RBD in a manner that disrupted the spike-ACE2

99

interaction. The second mAb, CV1, bound to an epitope distinct from the RBD and was

100

much less potent.

RESULTS

106

Serology

107

Serum and PBMC were collected twenty-one days after the onset of clinical disease. The

108

serum contained high titers of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 S2P (Fig. 1A). The

109

specificity of this response was confirmed by the absence of S2P reactivity by serum

110

antibodies isolated from donors collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, or donors

111

with confirmed infection by endemic coronaviruses. We also measured the serum

112

antibody response to RBD, and again observed specific high titers of binding antibodies

113

(Fig. 1B). Isotype-specific ELISA revealed that the IgG titers were higher than the IgA and

114

the IgM titers to both S2P and RBD, suggesting a significant portion of the antibody

115

responses to SARS-CoV-2 S are IgG (Fig. 1C and D). The serum from the SARS-CoV-2

116

infected donor displayed potent neutralizing activity (Reciprocal ID50~3000)against a

117

pseudovirus expressing the S protein from SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (Fig 1E).

118

We concluded that this donor had developed strong binding and neutralizing antibody

119

responses within three weeks of disease onset.

120

B cell sorts and VH/VL sequencing

121

Fluorescently labeled S2P and RBD probes were used as baits to identify B cells specific

122

to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein that were circulating at this timepoint. S2P was labeled with

123

either phycoerythrin (PE) or brilliant violet 711 (BV711) and used to stain B cells

124

concurrently. This double labeling strategy helps to discriminate between bona fide S2P-

125

specific B cells and non-specific background staining to the fluorophores. RBD was

126

labeled with alexa fluor 647 to identify B cells specific for that domain.

127

Approximately 0.65% of total CD19+ B cells were S2P positive compared to 0.07% of

128

total B cells from a naïve donor (Fig. S1A and B). The dominant responding B cells were

129

IgM+ IgD+ (49% of S2P+ B cells; Fig. S1C); 90% of which were CD27+ suggesting that

130

although these B cells have not class-switched, they were antigen-experienced memory

131

B cells. The second most prominent subset of S2P-specific B cells were class-switched

132

IgG+ IgD- B cells (27% of S2P+ B cells; Fig. S1C).

133

stained with S2P (Fig. 2A) and of those ~7% (or 0.12% of total IgG+ B cells, Fig. 2B) were

134

also positive for RBD.

135

We hypothesized that the class-switched SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells were more likely

136

to have undergone some affinity maturation and contain antibodies capable of

137

neutralizing the virus. Thus, we focused on our B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing on S2P+

138

IgG+ B cells. 576 S2P+ B cells were single-cell sorted into individual wells of a 96 well

139

plate and the variable heavy and light chain regions of B cell receptor transcripts were

140

sequenced using nested RT-PCR. We successfully recovered 103 successful VH

141

sequences, and 187 successful VL sequences, 97 of which were kappa and 90 were

142

lambda. B cells specific for S2P+ were derived from diverse antibody heavy and light

143

chain genes (Fig. 2C-E) and had normal distributions of CDRH3 and CDRL3 lengths (Fig.

144

2 F-G). Consistent with the relatively short time of infection the majority of BCR sequences

145

showed low levels of somatic mutation (Fig. 2H).

In fact, 1.7% of the IgG+ B cells

147

Among all successfully sequenced VH and VL transcripts, we obtained paired sequences

148

from forty-four. These were produced as recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of

149

the IgG1 isotype and tested for binding to recombinant S-derived proteins (Fig. 3).

150

All the mAbs bound to the stabilized SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain, S2P (Fig. 3A and E).

151

Consistent with the B cell staining that revealed very few RBD-specific B cells (Fig. 2B),

152

only three mAbs, CV5, CV30 and CV43, also bound the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 3B and

153

E). The majority of S2P-specific mAbs also bound to full-length membrane-bound

154

wildtype SARS-CoV-2 S on the surface of 293 cells (Fig. 3C and Fig. S2). The observation

155

that some S2P-specific mAbs failed to bind to cell surface S indicates that there may be

156

conformational differences between the stabilized soluble ectodomain and cell surface S.

157

The fact that a subset of the mAbs bound to a stabilized ectodomain variant of the closely

158

related SARS-CoV S protein (Fig. 3D and E), demonstrates that there are conserved

159

epitopes among the two viruses. Consistent with the lower degree of conservation of the

160

S1 subunit between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the anti-RBD mAbs CV30 and CV43

161

did not cross react with SARS-CoV S2P, while CV5 showed weak binding.

162

Neutralizing activity

163

The S2P-binding mAbs were evaluated for their ability to neutralize SARS CoV-2

164

pseudovirus infection of 293T cells stably expressing ACE2. All but two of the mAbs were

165

non-neutralizing (Fig. 4A and Table S1). Although it did not achieve 100% neutralization

166

at the highest concentration, CV1 which binds an epitope outside the RBD was weakly

167

neutralizing (IC50=15µg/ml, Fig. 4A and Table S1). CV1 neutralized less potently than an

168

ACE2-Fc fusion protein which acts as a soluble competitor for the interaction between S

169

and the cell surface-expressed ACE2 (IC50=2.2 µg/ml). In contrast, CV30 achieved 100%

170

neutralization and was ~480 times more potent than CV1 (IC50=0.03µg/ml, Fig. 4A and

171

Table S1). CV1, CV30 and the ACE2-Fc fusion did not neutralize a murine leukemia virus

172

pseudovirus demonstrating their specificity for the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Fig. 4B). CV30

173

is derived from a heavy chain utilizing an IGHV3-53*01 heavy chain and an IGKV3-30*01

174

light chain. CV1 binds an epitope outside the RBD and is derived from an IGHV4-38*02

175

heavy chain and an IGLV1-44*01 light chain. Both represent unique clones among all B

176

cells sequenced (Table S1).

177

Based on the observations that CV30 is potently neutralizing and it binds RBD with high

178

affinity, we investigated whether it would block the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2

179

protein and the ACE2 receptor. To this end we setup binding competition experiments

180

using BLI. Indeed, CV30 completely inhibited the RBD-ACE2 interaction. In contrast, CV5

181

and CV43, the other two anti-RBD mAbs and the CR3022 control, which binds the RBD

182

outside of the binding site, did not (Fig. 4C). We also measured the relative binding

183

affinities of CV30 and ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. ACE2 bound the RBD with an

184

affinity of 5.9 nM (Fig. 4D), while CV30 bound with a slightly higher affinity of 3.6 nM (Fig.

185

4E). The kinetics of the interactions were notably different, ACE2 had both a faster

186

association and dissociation rate than CV30 (Figs. 4D and E, and Table S2). Collectively

187

these results indicate that CV30 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the S-

188

ACE2 interaction through an interaction that is higher affinity.

191

DISCUSSION

192

The development of therapeutic interventions, of immunoprophylaxis and of an effective

193

vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 will benefit from understanding the protective immune

194

responses elicited during infection. A recent report indicated that neutralizing antibodies

195

are present in the sera collected from convalescent COVID-19 patients (Ni et al.; Okba et

196

al., 2020). However, the kinetics of neutralizing antibody development as well as the

197

characteristics and epitope specificities of neutralizing antibodies generated during

198

SARS-CoV-2 infection are presently poorly understood.

199

Serological analysis revealed that this COVID-19-infected patient developed high titers of

200

binding and neutralizing antibody responses twenty-one days following infection. The

201

development of neutralizing antibody titers at this early timepoint has been reported for

202

other COVID patients (Ni et al.; Okba et al., 2020) and is consistent with the rapid

203

development of neutralizing responses to SARS-CoV infection (Corti et al., 2011). At this

204

time point, IgG constituted the major fraction of anti-S2P and anti-RBD serum antibodies,

205

although both IgM and IgA antibodies against these viral antigens were detected in the

206

serum as well. The S2P-specific, class switched B cells circulating at this time point were

207

not dominated by any particular clone. Rather, they were derived from a diverse VH/VL

208

gene repertoire, with frequencies similar to those reported in healthy uninfected

209

individuals (Briney et al., 2019; DeKosky et al., 2016; Soto et al., 2019; Vazquez Bernat

210

et al., 2019).

211

Although anti-S2P antibodies isolated at this time point could bind the S protein, the

212

majority lacked neutralizing activity. However, two, CV1 and CV30, were able to

10

213

neutralize SARS-CoV-2. CV1 and C30 were derived from unique rearrangements among

214

all antibodies we examined. Thus, although diverse B cell clones became activated during

215

infection, the serum neutralizing activity is due to a relatively small subset.

216

CV1 binds to an unknown epitope region outside of the RBD, but the more potent CV30

217

recognizes the RBD and likely neutralizes infection by directly inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 S

218

binding to the ACE2 receptor. The RBD is a major target of neutralizing antibodies in

219

SARS-CoV infection (Cao et al., 2010). Several neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that

220

block the interaction of SARS-CoV with the ACE2 receptor have been described (Hwang

221

et al., 2006; Prabakaran et al., 2006; Rockx et al., 2008; Sui et al., 2004; Walls et al.,

222

2019). Moreover, the neutralizing potency correlated with the degree of S-ACE2 inhibition

223

(Rockx et al., 2008). The RBD of MERS-CoV is also a target of potent neutralizing

224

antibodies (Jiang et al., 2014; Niu et al., 2018; Tang et al., 2014; Ying et al., 2014),

225

highlighting the importance of receptor blocking antibodies for coronavirus vaccine

226

development. Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share extensive amino acid

227

sequence in the receptor binding domain (74%) and both viruses utilize human ACE2 for

228

entry, the amino acid identity in the receptor binding motif is only ~50% (Wan et al., 2020).

229

In line with this, potent anti-SARS-CoV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that bind RBD

230

fail to cross react with SARS-CoV-2 (Wrapp et al., 2020), similarly the anti-RBD mAb,

231

CV30 described herein fails to cross react with the SARS-CoV spike protein.

232

Consistent with the short time period post-infection, the majority of S-specific BCRs from

233

individual B cells were unmutated or had only accumulated very few mutations. This was

234

true for the neutralizing antibodies as well. CV1 was unmutated from germline, while

235

CV30 had 2 amino acid mutations in VH and none in VL. Largely unmutated antibodies

236

against SARS-CoV S (Prabakaran et al., 2006; Sui et al., 2004) and MERS-CoV S (Jiang

237

et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2014; Ying et al., 2014; Ying et al., 2015) have been isolated

238

from phage display libraries created from uninfected donors.

239

Potent anti-SARS-CoV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that bind RBD are derived

240

from different VH genes (VH1-18, VH1-69, or VH3-30) than CV30 (Prabakaran et al.,

241

2006; Sui et al., 2004; Traggiai et al., 2004; Walls et al., 2019). Anti-RBD antibodies that

242

neutralize MERS are derived from diverse gene families (Jiang et al., 2014; Niu et al.,

243

2018; Tang et al., 2014).

244

Collectively these results indicate that high-affinity coronavirus-neutralizing antibodies

245

require a short developmental pathway. This suggests that a vaccine against this virus

246

may only need to activate a subset of B cells for potent neutralizing antibody responses

247

to be developed, and that potent neutralizing antibodies are not V-gene restricted.

248

In sum, we provide information on the characteristics of early antibody and B cell

249

responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein during infection. Moreover, the neutralizing

250

antibodies discussed here can serve as templates for the design of immunogens and

251

potentially have utility as therapeutic and prophylactic agents to combat the SARS-CoV2

252

pandemic.

absorbance was reached and then eluted with 20mM sodium Phosphate, 0.5M NaCl,

343

500mM Imidazole HCl, pH 7.4). SARS-CoV S2P was further purified using a 2ml Strep-

344

Tactin sepharose column (IBA Lifesciences Cat# 2-1201-002) and Strep-Tactin

345

Purification Buffer Set (IBA Lifesciences Cat # 2-1002-001) according to the

346

manufacturer’s instructions. The S2P variants were then further purified using a Superose

347

6 10/300 GL column pre-equilibrated in 1XPBS or 2mM Tris 200mM NaCl, pH 8.0.

348

Supernatant containing RBD-Fc was purified over protein A agarose resin (Goldbio, Cat#

349

P-400), cleaved with HRV3C protease (made in house) on-column. The eluate containing

350

the RBD was further purified by SEC using HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (GE

351

Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in 2mM Tris-HCl, 200mM NaCl, pH 8.0. Proteins were

352

directly used for subsequent assays or aliquoted, flash frozen and kept at -80C until

353

further use.

354

Protein biotinylation

355

Purified recombinant S2P or RBD were biotinylated at a theoretical 1:1 ratio using the

356

Easylink NHS-biotin kit (Thermofisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

357

Excess biotin was removed via size exclusion chromatography using an ENrich SEC 650

371

SureBlue Reserve TMB Peroxidase Substrate (Seracare KPL, Cat# 5120-0080) was

372

added and incubated for 4 min followed by addition of 100μL of 1 N H 2SO4 to stop the

373

reaction. The optical density at 450nm was measured using a SpectraMax M2 plate

374

reader (Molecular Devices). All wash steps were performed using a BioTek 405 Select

375

Microplate Washer.

376

B cell sorting

377

Fluorescent SARS-CoV-2-specific S2P and RBD probes were made by combining

378

biotinylated protein with fluorescently labeled streptavidin (SA). The S2P probes were

379

made at a ratio of 2 moles of trimer to 1 mole SA. Two S2P probes, one labeled with

380

phycoerythrin (PE) (Invitrogen), one labeled with brilliant violet (BV) 711 (Biolegend),

381

were used in this panel in order to increase specificity of the detection of SARS-CoV-2-

382

specific B cells. The RBD probe was prepared at a molar ratio of 4 to 1 of protein to SA,

383

labeled with alexa fluor 647 (Invitrogen). Cryopreserved PBMC from the SARS-CoV-2-

384

infected participant and a SARS-naïve donor were thawed at 37°C and stained for SARS-

resuspended for sorting in 10% FBS/RPMI media containing 7AAD. The sample was

393

sorted on a FACS Aria II instrument (BD Biosciences) using the following gating strategy:

394

singlets, lymphocytes, live, CD3-, CD14-, CD4-, CD19+, IgD-, IgG+, S2P-PE+ and S2P-

395

BV711+. Two plates of S2P double positive IgD- B cells were single-cell index-sorted

396

into 96-well plates containing 16µl lysis buffer ((3.90% IGEPAL, 7.81mM DTT, 1250

397

398

IgG+ B cell population were single-cell index-sorted into dry 96-well plates and flash

399

frozen on dry ice. The RBD+ frequency of sorted B cells was analyzed post-sort using

400

the index file data in Flow Jo version 9.9.4 (Becton, Dickinson and Company).

401

B cell sequencing

402

cDNA was generated from sorted B cells by adding 4µl of iScript (Bio-Rad Cat# 1708891)

403

and cycling according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The VH and VL sequences were

404

recovered using gene specific primers and cycling conditions previously described(Tiller

405

Antibody purification

414

Antibody expression plasmids were co-transfected into 293E cells at a density of 106

415

cells/ml in Freestyle 293 media using the 293Free transfection reagent according to the

416

manufacturer’s instructions. Expression was carried out in Freestyle 293 media for 6

417

days, after which cells and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 4,000 × g

418

followed by filtration through a 0.22 µm filter. Clarified cell supernatant containing

419

recombinant antibodies was passed over Protein A Agarose (Goldbio Cat# P-400-5),

420

followed by extensive washing with PBS, and then eluted with 1 ml of Pierce IgG Elution

421

Buffer, pH 2.0, into 0.1 ml of Tris HCl, pH 8.0. Purified antibodies were then dialyzed

422

overnight into PBS, passed through a 0.2µM filter under sterile conditions and stored at -

423

80ºC until use.

424

Quantification and Statistical methods

425

Amino acid mutations were identified by aligning the VH/VL gene sequences to the

426

corresponding germline genes (IMGT Repertoire) using the Geneious Software (Version

427

8.1.9). Mutations were counted beginning at the 5’ end of the V-gene to the 3’ end of the

428

FW3. To quantify the number of amino acid mutations, the sequence alignments were

429

exported from Geneious and imported into R (Version 3.4.1) for analysis (R Core Team,

430

2017) (R Core Team, 2018). This analysis uses the packages Biostrings (Pages H, 2018),

431

seqinr (Charif D, 2007), and tidyverse (Wickham, 2017) in R andGraphPad Prism were

432

used to create graphs.

mAb binding screen:

437

mAbs were diluted in PBS to a concentration of 20µg/ml and captured using Anti-Human

438

IgG Fc capture (AHC) biosensors (Fortebio) for 240s. After loading, the baseline signal

439

was then recorded for 60s in KB. The sensors were then immersed in PBS containing

440

0.5-2µM of purified SARS CoV-2 S2P, SARS CoV-2 RBD, or SARS-CoV S2P for a 300s

441

Kinetic analyses:

446

For kinetic analyses CV30 was captured on anti-Human IgG Fc capture (AHC) sensors,

447

and ACE-2 Fc was captured on protein A biosensors. ligands were diluted to 10 µg/ml in

448

450

CoV-2 RBD in KB for 150s (association phase), followed by immersion in KB for an

451

additional 600s (dissociation phase). The background signal from each analyte-

452

containing well was measured using empty reference sensors and subtracted from the

453

signal obtained with each corresponding mAb loaded sensor. Kinetic analyses were

454

performed at least twice with an independently prepared analyte dilution series. Curve

50ul of cDMEM containing 6µg/ml polybrene was added to each well of 293T-ACE2 cells

503

(2µg/ml final concentration) and incubated for 30 min. The media was aspirated from

504

293T-ACE2 cells and 100µl of the virus-antibody mixture was added. The plates were

505

incubated at 37˚C for 72 hours. The supernatant was aspirated and replaced with 100ul

506

of Steadyglo luciferase reagent (Promega). 75µl was then transferred to an opaque, white

507

bottom plate and read on a Fluorskan Ascent Fluorimeter. Control wells containing virus

508

but no antibody (cells + virus) and no virus or antibody (cells only) were included on each

509

plate.

510

% neutralization for each well was calculated as the RLU of the average of the cells +

511

virus wells, minus test wells (cells +mAb + virus), and dividing this result difference by

512

the average RLU between virus control (cells+ virus) and average RLU between wells

513

containing cells alone, multiplied by 100.

514

mAbs that showed >50% neutralization at 50µg/ml, or plasma were further analyzed to

515

determine neutralizing potency, by preparing serial dilutions and conducting the

516

neutralization assay as described above. The antibody concentration or plasma dilution

517

that neutralized 50% of infectivity (IC50 or ID50, respectively) was interpolated from the

518

neutralization curves determined using the log(inhibitor) vs. response -- Variable slope

519

(four parameters) fit using automatic outlier detection in Graphpad Prism Software. As a

520

control for specificity SARS CoV2-mAbs were tested for neutralizing activity against HIV-

521

1 derived virions pseudotyped with murine leukemia virus envelope (MLV).
