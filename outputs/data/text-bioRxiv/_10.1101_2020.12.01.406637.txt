Abstract
Three-dimensional structures of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviral proteins archived in
the Protein Data Bank were used to analyze viral proteome evolution during the first six
months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses of spatial locations, chemical properties, and
structural and energetic impacts of the observed amino acid changes in >48,000 viral
proteome sequences showed how each one of the 29 viral study proteins have undergone
amino acid changes. Structural models computed for every unique sequence variant
revealed that most substitutions map to protein surfaces and boundary layers with a
minority affecting hydrophobic cores. Conservative changes were observed more
frequently in cores versus boundary layers/surfaces. Active sites and protein-protein
interfaces showed modest numbers of substitutions. Energetics calculations showed that
the impact of substitutions on the thermodynamic stability of the proteome follows a
universal bi-Gaussian distribution. Detailed results are presented for six drug discovery
targets and four structural proteins comprising the virion, highlighting substitutions with
the potential to impact protein structure, enzyme activity, and functional interfaces.
Characterizing the evolution of the virus in three dimensions provides testable insights
into viral protein function and should aid in structure-based drug discovery efforts as well
as the prospective identification of amino acid substitutions with potential for drug
resistance.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 global pandemic, is a member of the
coronavirus family of RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds (Y. Chen, Liu,
& Guo, 2020). The viral genome resembles a single-stranded cellular messenger RNA,
~29.9kb in length with a 7-methyl-G 5’ cap, a 3’ poly-A tail, and more than 10 open
reading frames or Orfs (Figure 1). Viral proteins are expressed in two ways. Translation of
two long polyproteins occurs initially, yielding the machinery required to copy the viral
genome. Subsequent expression of multiple sub-genomic mRNAs produces the four
structural proteins present in virions (see below) and other proteins designated as Orf3a,
Orf6, Orf7a, Orf7b, Orf8, Orf9b, Orf14, and possibly the hypothetical protein Orf10. The
non-structural proteins (nsps) are expressed within the shorter polyprotein 1a (pp1a,
encompassing nsp1-nsp11) and the longer polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab, encompassing nsp1nsp16). Both pp1a and pp1ab require two virally-encoded proteases for processing into
individual nsp protomers (Figure 1). nsp3 includes a papain-like protease (PLPro) domain,
which is responsible for polypeptide chain cleavage at three sites within the N-terminal
portions of both polyproteins (dark blue inverted triangles in Figure 1). Ten additional
polypeptide chain cleavages are carried out by nsp5 (light blue inverted triangles in Figure
1), also known as the main protease or the 3C-like protease. The structural proteins
present in mature virions include the S-protein (surface spike glycoprotein, responsible
for viral entry), the N-protein (nucleocapsid protein), the E-protein (a pentameric ion
channel), and the M-protein (a second integral membrane protein found in the viral lipid
bilayer).
Coronaviruses have the longest RNA virus genomes of all known single-stranded RNA
viruses. Their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (consisting of nsp7, two copies of nsp8,
and nsp12) act together with RNA helicases (nsp13) and proofreading exonucleases
(nsp14), to ensure efficient and relatively faithful copying of the lengthy genome (Denison,
Graham, Donaldson, Eckerle, & Baric, 2011). Proofreading by nsp14 notwithstanding,
coronavirus genome replication is not perfect, and coronaviruses do evolve as they
passage serially from one host to the next. Today in the time of COVID-19, genome
sequence-based "fingerprinting" of the virus in near real time during the pandemic has
provided very detailed accounts of how the virus has moved around the globe since late
2019 as infected individuals, many of them asymptomatic, travelled from continent to
continent (Hadfield et al., 2018; Wang, Hozumi, Yin, & Wei, 2020). Viral genome
fingerprinting has also enabled detailed analyses of the impact of amino acid changes in
particular proteins that modulate infectivity, etc. (e.g., (Korber et al., 2020)).
Herein, we report a comprehensive study of how the SARS-CoV-2 proteome has evolved
in 3D during the first six months of the pandemic between late 2019 and June 25th 2020.

We combined viral genome sequence data assembled by GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org),
the wealth of experimental 3D structure information for SARS-CoV-2 and other
coronavirus proteins available from the open-access Protein Data Bank or PDB (Berman
et al., 2000; Protein Data Bank, 1971; wwPDB consortium, 2019), and computed structural
models in cases where experimentally-determined structures were not available.
The bulk of this work was initiated by research interns (undergraduates and one high
school student) hosted virtually during the summer of 2020 by the Rutgers University
Institute for Quantitative Biomedicine (IQB), the Rutgers University RISE Program, and the
US-funded RCSB Protein Data Bank headquartered at Rutgers (Burley et al., 2018; Stephen
K. Burley et al., 2020; Goodsell et al., 2020). Prior to the online five-week research program,
participating students and mentors received one week of online training in 3D molecular
visualization and computational bioinformatics in the IQB “Summer of the Coronaverse”
Online Boot Camp (S. K. Burley et al., 2020). The methods used in the research study were
developed, evaluated, and refined during the online Boot Camp. Supervision of the
research phase was provided by IQB graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and RCSB
Protein Data Bank scientific staff, all of whom served as mentors in the Boot Camp. The
research interns worked collaboratively in teams, carrying out multiple sequence
alignments, constructing phylogenetic trees, computing 3D structural models of viral
proteins, visualizing 3D structures, and analyzing the structural, functional, and energetic
consequences of SARS-CoV-2 protein amino acid substitutions identified during the first
six months of the pandemic. All computed 3D structural models and results of the
sequence/energetics analyses are described in the main body of this paper and
accompanying Supplementary Materials. The computed 3D structural models and
energetics results are made freely available under Creative Commons license CC0 for

Results and Discussion
Sequence Analyses: Viral genome sequencing and alignments of more than 48,000
individual isolates revealed protein sequence variation between December 2019 and late
June 2020. We investigated the spatial locations, chemical properties, and structural and
energetic impacts of the observed amino acid changes with reference to the original viral
genome/proteome sequence publicly released in January 2020.
Every one of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 study proteins listed in Table 1 underwent changes in
amino sequence, generating an average of approximately one unique sequence variant
(USV) per study-protein amino acid residue (Lowest: nsp10 at ~0.59 USVs/residue;
Highest: Orf3a at ~2.46 USVs/residue). Protein sequence differences were entirely
restricted to non-synonymous changes in one or more residues. No insertions or deletions
were detected in any of the 29 study proteins. Most USVs reflect a single amino acid
change in the protein sequence (~66.8%). Smaller proportions of the USVs showed
accumulation of two (~25.4%), three (~6.8%), four (~0.8%), or rarely five or more (~0.2%)
amino acid substitutions. Where multiple substitutions were observed in a given studyprotein USV, visual inspection of GISAID metadata typically revealed that they
accumulated serially, but no systematic effort was made to track sequence changes as a
function of sample collection date or geographic location. The modest degree of amino
acid sequence variation observed for each of the 29 study proteins analyzed herein is
consistent with previous studies of coronavirus evolution, which underscore the
importance of the 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease activity of nsp14 (reviewed in (Denison et al.,
2011)). In contrast, RNA viruses that do not possess proofreading enzymes (e.g., hepatitis
C virus) exhibit significantly higher rates of amino acid substitution (Simmonds et al.,
2005).

Mapping Locations of Observed Sequence Variations in 3D: Experimental structures or
computed 3D structural models were assembled for all 29 study proteins and their
respective USVs (see Materials and Methods). For each study protein, we identified amino
acid substitutions mapping to sites in the polypeptide chain buried in the hydrophobic
core, exposed on the macromolecule surface, and present in the “boundary” layer
between the core and the surface (Table 2). Not surprisingly, most of the amino acid
substitutions occur on the protein surface (~46.2%) or within the boundary layer (~46.4%).
Very few occur in the protein core (~7.4%). Characterization of the nature of each
substitution (conserved, non-conserved) revealed that non-conservative amino acid
changes were common, albeit less so if they occurred in the core (~54.0%) or the
boundary layer (~55.0%), rather than on the protein surface (~69.4%). (N.B. A minority of
USVs for some study proteins could not be modeled in 3D due to incomplete structural
information.)
To further examine the types of amino acid changes in the viral proteome, we generated
location-based substitution matrices from the observed USVs for each study protein and
for the entire viral proteome (Figure 2). Substitutions to or from all 20 amino acids were
observed across all 29 study proteins. Notable non-conservative changes include
hydrophobic residues changing to negatively charged residues and vice versa, and glycine
and proline residues changing to all types of amino acids on the surface, and to a lesser
extent within the boundary layer. These trends reflect anticipated constraints imposed by
protein structure on the thermodynamic stability due to amino acid substitutions. In the
tightly packed environment of the hydrophobic core of a protein, fewer types of amino
acid substitutions are likely to be compatible with the 3D structure, and changes that do
not impair protein function are likely to be conservative. In contrast, protein boundary
layers and surfaces impose far fewer constraints in terms of structural incompatibility and
non-conservative substitutions.
Most of the observed non-conservative changes can be attributed to the architecture of
the genetic code and single base changes in the viral RNA genome. For example, Alanine
to Aspartic and Glutamic acid changes are achievable via single base changes in the
second base of their respective codons. However, changes requiring double base changes
(e.g., Proline to Aspartate) were also observed.

Variations:
The energetic impact of observed amino acid substitutions for each unique sequence
variant of each study protein was calculated using Rosetta (Table 2, Figure 3). A majority
of the amino acid changes were estimated to be moderately destabilizing as judged by
changes in the free energy of stabilization (apparent G or GApp =0.0 to +15.0 Rosetta
energy units or REU; ~72.0%). A modest number were estimated to be stabilizing

(GApp=-0.01 to -15.0 REU; ~23.7%). In the minority of cases, GApp exceeded +15.0
REU (~4.3%). The distribution of GApp values was used to identify outliers for each study
protein (Table 2).
Given that all modeled amino acid substitutions were detected in viruses that likely had
infected human hosts when they were isolated, we assume that all modeled USVs
correspond to stable, functional proteins. Most globular proteins are marginally stable,
with measured free energies of stabilization G~-5 to -15 kcal/mol (Privalov & Gill, 1988),
and tolerated amino acid substitutions are expected to have an impact within this range.
Therefore, we believe that the small minority of computed large positive GApp values
represent artifacts arising from errors/approximations in our calculations (Table 2). For
example, positional restraints on backbone atoms were employed when modeling USVs
in Rosetta to prevent substantial departures from the reference protein backbone
conformation so more permissive restraints on the polypeptide chain backbone may be
required to model computationally the effects of some particularly large amino acid
changes. Alternatively, large positive values of GApp may reflect shortcomings in the
Rosetta energy function. Outlier cases provide a benchmark for improvements in Rosetta
and other stability calculation approaches. Outliers notwithstanding, ~95% of all
computationally modeled USVs yielded reasonable GApp values.
We next examined the distribution of energetic effects of the observed substitutions for
each study protein and aggregated across all 29 viral study proteins. Several previously
published experimental and theoretical studies have examined the distributions of
thermodynamic stability changes due to point substitutions in individual proteins, and
examined the implication of these distributions for molecular evolution (Bloom et al.,
2005; Faure & Koonin, 2015; Razban & Shakhnovich, 2020; Tokuriki, Stricher,
Schymkowitz, Serrano, & Tawfik, 2007). Our dataset provides an opportunity to reexamine conclusions from these studies which are, with a single exception (Nisthal, Wang,
Ary, & Mayo, 2019), based on limited experimental data and/or computational findings.
Tokuriki et al. (2007) used FoldX-based calculations of all single substitutions in 21
different globular proteins and found that despite a diverse range of sizes and folds, the
distribution of stability effects largely follows a bi-Gaussian function for each protein. They
found that surface residues exhibit a narrow distribution with a modestly destabilizing
mean ΔΔGApp (<GApp>), whereas core residues exhibit a wider distribution with higher
positive <ΔΔGApp> values (Tokuriki et al., 2007). Such asymmetric distributions were also
found for lattice model proteins, and were recently shown to arise from first-principle
statistical mechanical considerations and a sufficiently large amino acid alphabet size
(Razban & Shakhnovich, 2020). Faure and Koonin (2015) obtained similar distributions
across proteomes of five organisms selected from archaea, prokaryota, and eukaryota,

suggesting that this distribution of energetic effects is a universal and evolutionarily
conserved feature of globular protein folds (Faure & Koonin, 2015).
In contrast with larger and more comprehensive datasets used in previous work (all
substitutions at all sites in a protein), approximately one substitution per residue per study
protein was sampled in the SARS-CoV-2 dataset downloaded from GISAID. To investigate
whether or not the observed stability effects follow a similar distribution, we fit biGaussian models to GApp histograms for all USVs for all 29 proteins (Figure 3). The biGaussian distribution fits the calculated stability distributions better than a single
Gaussian (R2=0.95 for a bi-Gaussian and R2=0.80 for a single Gaussian). Individual
Gaussian peaks correspond closely to the energetic impacts of surface and core
substitutions, respectively (Figure 3). This trend was observed for both types of Rosettabased stability calculations, including those in which a dampened repulsive van der Waals
potential was used during the rotamer optimization step. For each calculation type, the
mean destabilization calculated for the core substitution distribution is smaller than the
mean value associated with the second Gaussian peak observed in the full set of
substitutions, possibly due to contributions to the second peak from destabilizing
boundary layer substitutions that shift the mean to higher values (and possibly to
limitations of the sampling and scoring approach discussed above). Bi-Gaussian fits to
GApp distributions for each of the 29 study proteins considered individually
(Supplementary Table Gaussian) show similarly good fits for bi-Gaussian functions for
globular study proteins. Robustness with respect to destabilizing effects of amino acid
changes both limits and promotes viral evolution. It is, therefore, remarkable that the
observed variation in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome over the first six months of the pandemic
follows this universal trend, speaking perhaps to the relative rapidity of viral evolution due
to large population sizes and imperfect replication machinery.

substitutions were included in single Gaussian fitting when all substitutions mapped to
the same region of the study protein.

Analyses of Study Proteins: The sections that follow provide more detailed results and
discussion pertaining to USVs identified for 13 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 study proteins,
including one validated drug target [RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp,
nsp7/nsp82/nsp12 heterotetramer)], five potential small-molecule drug discovery targets
[papain-like proteinase (PLPro, part of nsp3), main protease (nsp5), RNA helicase (nsp13),
proofreading exoribonuclease (nsp14), and methyltransferase (nsp10/nsp16
heterodimer)], plus the four structural proteins comprising the virion [spike S-protein,
nucleocapsid N-protein, pentameric ion channel E-protein, and integral membrane Mprotein]. Analysis results obtained for USVs of the remaining study proteins are provided
in Supplementary Materials together with additional information regarding all 29 study
proteins.
Non-structural Proteins 7, 8, and 12 (nsp7/nsp82/nsp12): The RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp) is a macromolecular machine made up of four protomers, including
nsp7, two asymmetrically bound copies of nsp8, and the catalytic subunit nsp12. The
resulting heterotetramer is responsible for copying the RNA genome and generating nine
subgenomic RNAs (D. Kim et al., 2020). nsp12 consists of three globular domains: an Nterminal nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN), an interface domain,
and a C-terminal RdRp domain. The active site of nsp12 includes residues Thr611 to
Met626 (TPHLMGWDYPKCDRAM) comprising Motif A (Y. Gao et al., 2020). nsp12 binds to
one turn of double-stranded RNA, and residues D760 and D761 bind to the 3’ end of the
RNA and are essential for RNA synthesis (Hillen et al., 2020). The RNA duplex is flanked
by α-helical arms formed by N-terminal segments of the two nsp8 protomers, which
appear to grip the RNA and prevent its premature dissociation from the RdRp (i.e., confer
processivity). Positively-charged residues of nsp8 occurring within the RdRp-RNA
interface include K36, K37, K39, K40, K46, R51, R57, K58, and K61. Of these, K58 interacts
with the RNA duplex emerging from the active site. Any change of this residue in nsp8
yields a replication-incompetent virus (Hillen et al., 2020). Since deposition of PDB ID
6M71 (Y. Gao et al., 2020), a plethora of RdRp structures has become available from the
PDB.
Following US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for remdesivir, RdRp can be
regarded as being a validated drug target for treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected
individuals. Structures of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp containing incorporated remdesivir (PDB ID
7BV2 (Yin et al., 2020) and PDB ID 7C2K (Q. Wang, J. Wu, et al., 2020)) help explain the
drug’s mechanism of action via delayed-chain termination (Gordon et al., 2020) and
provide a valuable starting point for design of second-generation RdRp inhibitors that are
more potent and more selective and possibly orally bioavailable. Residues K545, R553,
D623, S682, T687, N691, S759, D760, and D761 in nsp12 interact directly with remdesivir
(Yin et al., 2020), while S861 may be involved in a steric clash with the 1’-CN group of

remdesivir, possibly perturbing the position of the RNA duplex (Q. Wang, J. Wu, et al.,
2020). Knowledge of the structures of remdesivir-RdRp complexes will also provide
valuable insights into potential sources of drug resistance.
The experimental structure of the RdRp-duplex RNA complex (PDB ID 6YYT (Hillen et al.,
2020)) was used for evolutionary analyses of nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 (Fig. RdRp A and B).
Each protomer is considered in turn below.
nsp7: Sequencing of 48,670 viral genomes identified 47,876 unchanged sequences and
68 USVs of nsp7 versus the reference sequence, with 66 single and two double
substitutions (Tables 1 and 2). Most substitutions occurred in only one USV (~91%). The
most frequently observed USV for nsp7 (S25L; non-conservative, surface) was detected
562 times in the GISAID dataset.
nsp8: Sequencing of 48,335 viral genomes identified 47,635 unchanged sequences and
144 USVs of nsp8 versus the reference protein sequence, with 140 single, two double, one
triple, and one quintuple substitutions (Tables 1 and 2). Most substitutions occurred in
only one USV (~99%). The most frequently observed USV for nsp8 (M129I; conservative,
core) was detected 124 times in the GISAID dataset. No substitutions of the essential RNAbinding residue K58 were observed. Of the remaining eight positively-charged residues
that face the RNA duplex, substitutions were observed for five, including K37, K40, R51,
R57, and K61 (both R51L and R57L preclude salt bridge formation with RNA). Substitutions
of R51 were observed in 3 different USVs, occurring as three distinct substitutions (R51L,
R51C, R51H). Another interesting nsp8 USV is the singly-observed quintuple substitution
USV occurring within the N-terminal arm (A74S/S76C/A81S/V83L/S85M). This USV may
be the result of a sequencing artifact, as none of the five substitutions were observed in
any other USV. One other USV exhibits adjacent amino acid changes: M90S/L91F. This
pair of residues occurs at the interface with nsp12 for one nsp8 protomer and near a
shared interface with nsp7 and nsp12 in the other copy.
nsp12: Sequencing of 44,203 viral genomes identified 10,266 unchanged sequences and
730 USVs of nsp12 versus the reference sequence, with 249 single, 424 double, 51 triple,
3 quadruple, and 3 multi-point substitutions (Tables 1 and 2). A majority of substitutions
occurred in only one USV (~74%). More than 97% (count~32,000) of the ~44,000 GISAID
dataset nsp12 sequences differing from the reference sequence carried the same P323L
substitution. This substitution constitutes a distinct nsp12 clade that was first detected in
the United Kingdom in January 2020 and subsequently in many other countries around
the world.

Approximately 61% of the observed amino acid substitutions were non-conservative (364
non-conservative versus 228 conservative), with most of the non-conservative changes
occurring in the boundary and surface portions of the 3D structure. (N.B.: Only 60 point
substitutions map to the protein core.) Two of the multi-point substitutions
(A97V/S520I/E522D/D523Y/A529S/L829I and T85S/I201F/V202F/V330E/I333T) were
observed only once. In both cases, all substitutions were unique to that particular USV,
suggesting that they are both the result of sequencing artifacts.
nsp7/nsp82/nsp12 Energetics: The vast majority of the USVs (83%) were estimated to be
moderately less stable than the reference sequence (<GApp>~+7.6 REU). In fewer than
4% cases, the estimated change in apparent free energy of stabilization change exceeded
+19.1 REU. A minority of the USVs (~13%) were estimated to be more stable than the
reference sequence (<GApp>~-2.2 REU). (N.B.: Hereafter, references will be made to
Tables 1 and 2 to avoid repeating the same text summarizing amino acid substitutions
and energetics analyses for each of the remaining study proteins.)
nsp12 Active Site: Of the residues in active site Motif A (Fig. RdRp C), substitutions were
observed in residues H613, L614, M615, W617, Y619, and A625 (Fig. RdRp C). It is
remarkable that all of these residues are oriented toward the hydrophobic core of the
protein, away from the active site, and should, therefore, not disrupt catalysis. No
substitutions were observed for nsp12 residues that interact directly or via bridging water
molecules with remdesivir (Fig. RdRp C; K545, R553, D623, N691, D760, S759, D760).
Protein-Protein Interfaces: The four protomers forming the RdRp heterotetramer bury
significant numbers of residues within the various protein-protein interfaces. It is,
therefore, difficult to be certain that a distal substitution might not have a steric influence
on one or more of these interfaces. Below, we enumerate substitutions with the potential
for direct effects on interfacial contacts.
Eleven substitutions involving the following six nsp7 residues could affect binding to
nsp12: K7, L14, S15, S26, L40, and L41. Seven of these 11 substitutions were conservative.
nsp12 substitutions at the following sites could affect binding to nsp7: T409, P412, F415,
Y420, E436, A443, and D445. Y420S would break an observed hydrogen bond with D5 of
nsp7. E436G/K would break an observed salt bridge with K43. Many of the nsp7 and nsp12
substitutions occurring within their contact interface were highly destabilizing, with seven
giving GApp>+10 REU.
nsp7 makes minimal contact with one copy of nsp8. Observed nsp7 substitutions at
residues S25 (S25L) and S26 (S26A and S26F) involve exchange of serine for a hydrophobic

residue. Both substitutions at S26 break an observed hydrogen bond with D163 of nsp8.
No nsp8 D163 substitutions were identified.
The contact surface of nsp7 with the second copy of nsp8 is more extensive than with the
first. nsp7 substitutions occurring within this inter-subunit interface include residues V6,
T9, S15, V16, L20, L28, Q31, F49, E50, M52, S54, L56, S57, V58, L60, S61, V66, I68, and L71
(17/27 substitutions affecting all 19 nsp7 residues were conservative). S54P is a
noteworthy amino acid change that inserts a Proline into the middle of an interfacial αhelix. Substitutions of the following nsp8 residues may affect binding to nsp7: residues
V83, T84, S85, T89, M90, L91, M94, L95, N100, A102, I107, V115, P116, I119, L122, V131,
and A150 (14 of the 21 substitutions involving these 17 sites were conservative).
Because the two nsp8 chains occur in asymmetric environments, a given substitution may
alter one interface or the other, or both. Substitutions at 23 sites could affect the nsp8nsp12 interface for one of the chains (T84, A86, L91, L95, N104, I107, V115, P116, I119,
P121, L122, T123, K127, M129, V131, I132, P133, T141, A150, W154, V160, W182, and
T187). Substitutions at five sites (T68, K72, R75, S76, and K79) could affect only the nsp8nsp12 interface with the chain that wraps around nsp7. Substitutions at three sites (V83,
M90, and M94) could affect both interfaces. Of these 38 substitutions across 31 sites, 19
were conservative. A P121S substitution in nsp8 could give rise to a backbone hydrogen
bond with V398 of nsp12. Two Tryptophan to Cysteine substitutions (W154C and W182C)
occurring in nsp8 were extreme outliers with ∆∆GApp>+30 REU, suggesting that some
backbone rearrangement is necessary in response to exchange of the large Tryptophan
side chains for smaller Cysteines.
In nsp12, substitutions of 25 residues could affect the interface with the first nsp8
protomer (L270, P323, T324, P328, L329, V330, V338, F340, P378, A379, M380, A382, A383,
N386, V398, A399, V405, F407, W509, L514, S518, M519, S520, D523, and V675).
Substitutions of 10 residues in nsp12 could affect the interface formed with the second
copy of nsp8 (N414, F415, D846, I847, V848, T850, M899, M902, M906, T908). No nsp12
substitutions appear to affect contacts with both copies of nsp8. Of the 50 observed nsp12
substitutions occurring at 35 sites, 26 were conservative. The clade-defining nsp12 P323L
substitution occurs at the C-terminus of an α-helix within the smaller interface between
nsp12 and the first nsp8 protomer. While the structural consequences of this P→L
substitution appear negligible, the computed ∆∆GApp ~8 REU. This apparent discrepancy
almost certainly reflects limitations in the Rosetta energetics calculation.

Non-structural Protein 3 Papain-like Proteinase (PLPro): The papain-like proteinase
(PLPro) is a 343-residue segment occurring within the 1945 residue multi-domain protein
nsp3. It is one of two viral proteases responsible for processing of the polyprotein
products of translation of the viral genome following infection. This enzyme cleaves the
polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab at three sites (black inverted triangles in Figure 1): the
nsp1/nsp2 junction and its own N- and C-termini. These three cleavage events liberate
nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3. The PLPro portion of nsp3 is also implicated in cleaving posttranslational modifications of ubiquitin (Ubl) and ISG15 domains of host proteins as an
evasion mechanism against host antiviral immune responses (Clementz et al., 2010).
PLPro is a cytoplasmic cysteine endopeptidase (EC 3.4.22.69) that catalyzes cleavage of
the peptide bond C-terminal to LXGG motifs (where X is any amino acid) in the viral
polyproteins. This enzyme also recognizes conserved LRGG motifs found within the Cterminal segments of Ubl and ISG15 proteins. According to the MEROPS classification,
PLPro belongs to the peptidase clan CA (family C16), containing a Cys-His-Asp catalytic
triad (C111–H272–D286). The first structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLPro to be made public (PDB
ID 6W9C (Michalska, 2020)) revealed a symmetric homotrimer with each enzyme
monomer being highly similar to that of SARS-CoV-1 PLPro (PDB ID 2FE8 (Ratia et al.,
2006); root mean square deviation or r.m.s.d.~0.8Å, sequence identity~83%). Since PDB
release of this initial SARS-CoV-2 PLPro structure, additional co-crystal structures of PLPro
with a variety of ligands have been deposited to the PDB (list updated weekly at
http://rcsb.org/covid19). In many of these structures the enzyme is monomeric, indicating
that the trimer observed in PDB ID 6W9C is almost certainly a crystal packing artifact.
Comparison of the various PLPro monomer structures reveals that the enzyme does not
undergo large conformational changes upon binding of inhibitors or (protein) substrates
(Fig. PLPro A). We, therefore, used the structure of an inhibited form of the enzyme (PDB
ID 6WUU (Rut et al., 2020)) for evolutionary analyses of PLPro (Fig. PLPro A).
Overall substitution trends for PLPro and energetics analysis results are summarized in
Tables 1 and 2. P1640L (non-conservative, surface) and T1626I (non-conservative, surface)
are the two most common USVs, observed in 48 and 47 GISAID dataset sequences,
respectively. No amino acid substitutions were identified in the enzyme active site – the
catalytic triad is fully preserved in all observed USVs. However, examination of apo- and
inhibitor/substrate-bound structures indicates that several substitutions occur in the
ISG15- and ubiquitin-binding regions of PLPro. These substitutions (e.g., F1632S, D1624G,
D1625H, S1633G) mapping to the S2 and S4 α-helices of PLPro (Fig. PLPro B) may alter
the binding affinity and specificity of PLPro for interactions with host protein substrates.
In cell-based assays, the interactome of SARS-CoV-2 PLPro appears to be significantly
different from that of SARS-CoV-1 PLPro. SARS-CoV-2 PLPro prefers ISG15 binding to Ubl
whereas SARS-CoV-1 PLPro prefers Ubl binding to ISG15 (Shin et al., 2020). The S2 and

S4 regions are interaction hotspots in the interfaces of PLPro with ISG15 and Ubl. Amino
acid changes in these regions may change the protein’s interactome. Finally, two observed
substitutions affecting active-site proximal proline residues P1810S and P1811S may
affect inhibitor binding and represent potential sites of drug resistance mutations (Fig.
PLPro C).

Non-structural Protein 5 Main Protease (nsp5): nsp5 is the other viral protease responsible
for processing the viral polyproteins (synonyms: main protease, 3CL protease). This
enzyme cleaves the longer polyprotein pp1ab at 11 sites (light blue inverted triangles in
Figure 1), beginning with liberation of its own N-terminus and concluding with separation
of nsp15 from nsp16 near the C-terminus of the polyprotein. nsp5 is a 306-residue
cysteine endopeptidase (EC 3.4.22.69) that catalyzes cleavage of sites similar to
TSAVLQ/SGFRK (where / denotes the cleavage site). Conserved residues Histidine 41 (H41)
and Cysteine 145 (C145) constitute the catalytic dyad (Huang, Wei, Fan, Liu, & Lai, 2004).
The first structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 deposited into the PDB (PDB ID 6LU7 (Jin et al.,
2020); Figure nsp5) revealed a symmetric homodimeric structure extremely similar to that
of its SARS-CoV-1 homolog (r.m.s.d.~0.8Å, sequence identity>95% with PDB ID 1Q2W
(Pollack, 2003)). Since PDB release of this initial nsp5 structure, ~200 co-crystal structures
of nsp5 with a variety of small chemical fragments and larger ligands have been deposited
to the PDB (updated weekly at http://rcsb.org/covid19). Open access to this wealth of
structural information spurred the launch of an international COVID-19 Moonshot effort
to discover and develop drug-like inhibitors (Chodera, Lee, London, & von Delft, 2020).
The inaugural nsp5 structure (PDB ID 6LU7) was used for the evolutionary analyses that
follow (Fig. nsp5 A).
Overall substitution trends for nsp5 and energetics analysis results are summarized in
Tables 1 and 2. G15S (non-conservative, boundary) is the most common USV, observed
in 1082 sequences. The most striking change observed in the GISAID dataset involves H41,
the catalytic Histidine (Fig. nsp5 B, shown in red) substitution of which is expected to
eliminate catalytic activity. This substitution was detected in the H41P/L50H double
substitution. It is possible that loss of H41 has been compensated by the L50H
substitution, though the distance between L50 and the active site (L50:C𝛼-C145:C𝛼~16Å
versus H41:C𝛼-C145:C𝛼~7Å) would require significant backbone rearrangement. Only
one viral genome with this USV was detected in the GISAID dataset, which raises the
possibility that it represents a sequencing artifact. No other observed USVs included
substitutions of residue L50 to Histidine, but other amino acid changes at that site were
observed within the GISAID dataset. Experimental characterization of the enzymatic
activity of the H41P;L50H double substitution would resolve the issue.
Several amino acids within or adjacent to the substrate binding groove underwent
substitutions (Fig. nsp5 B, shown in purple) that may affect substrate binding, including
T25, M49, M165, E166, 168, 188, 189, and A191. The most dramatic alteration to the active
site occurs in the triple substitution M165L;E166V;A191E. E166 lines the active site cleft,
where it is thought to form a hydrogen bond with the pre-scissile residue of the substrate.
The same residue also appears to interact with the N-terminus of the homodimeric

partner. Each of these substitutions is unique to a single USV, occurring only once in the
GISAID dataset. Other substitutions were observed at residues 165 and 191 in other USVs.
A number of residues occurring near the dimerization interface were also substituted,
including residues M6, A7, G71, A116, S121, V125, G170, G215, M276, G278, S284, A285,
Q299, G302, and T304, any one of which could affect dimerization. In several cases, Glycine
residues were substituted for larger hydrogen-bonding residues (even when such
substitutions appear to be destabilizing: G71S, G170R, G215R, G278R). While total stability
was reduced, dimeric stability was likely increased, consistent with the expected biological
importance of strong dimerization. Interesting, all substitutions mapping to the dimer
interface occurred in USVs lacking any other substitutions.
Finally, there were four cases in which substitutions to Proline (a helix breaking amino
acid) occurred at positions falling within α-helical or β-strand secondary structural
elements (K90P, S123P, A206P, S301P). The latter three represent the most extreme
energetic outliers of all USVs, and all four were observed only once in the GISAID dataset.
S123P occurs at the end of a β-strand at the dimeric interface near the C-terminus of the
homodimeric partner. The observed energetic consequences of these substitutions
introducing Proline residues suggest the potential for significant structural perturbation.

Non-structural protein 13 (nsp13): nsp13 plays a central role in viral replication by
unwinding RNA secondary structure within the 5′ untranslated region of the genome
(Miao, Tidu, Eriani, & Martin, 2020). The enzyme is NTP-dependent and is also known to
exhibit 5′-triphosphatase activity. nsp13 is most active in the presence of the RdRp, which
suggests that the helicase is required for high-efficiency copying of the viral genome
(Adedeji et al., 2012). A recently published 3D electron microscopy (3DEM) structure of
the nsp7-nsp82-nsp12/nsp132 heterohexamer provide a structural model for how two
copies of the helicase could interoperate with RdRp during RNA synthesis (PDB ID 6XEZ
(J. Chen et al., 2020)).
nsp13, a member of helicase superfamily 1, consists of 596 amino acid residues. It adopts
a triangular pyramid-like structure consisting of five domains (Zn++-binding, stalk, 1B, 1A,
and 2A), with each domain directly or indirectly involved in the helicase function. There
are three Zn++-binding sites located within the N-terminus of the enzyme, involving
conserved cysteine and histidine residues (Zn++-1: C5, C8, C26, C29; Zn++-2: C16, C19, H33,
H39; Zn++-3: C50, C55, C72, H75). NTPase activity is mediated by six conserved residues
situated at the base of the 1A and 2A domains (K288, S289, D374, E375, Q404, R567). The
nucleic acid binding channel is formed by domains 1B, 1A, and 2A (Jia et al., 2019).
Sequence alignment of SARS-CoV-1 nsp13 with SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 revealed near-perfect
identity with a single amino acid difference (I570V). The experimental structure of SARSCoV-1 nsp13 (PDB ID 6JYT (Jia et al., 2019)) provided the template for Rosetta
computation of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 homology model used to analyze its evolution in
3D (Fig. nsp13).
Overall substitution trends for nsp13 and energetics analysis results are summarized in
Tables 1 and 2. The double substitution P504L;Y541C is the most common nsp13 USV,
observed 1,607 times in the GISAID dataset. No substitutions were observed for 11 of the
12 Zn++-binding residues. A single substitution was observed for Histidine 33 changing
to Glutamine (H33Q), which appears unlikely to abrogate binding of Zn++. Potentially
important amino acid substitutions involve R337 and R339, two residues known to
support helicase activity that are positioned at the entrance of the nucleic acid binding
channel. Substitutions were observed in the R337L;A362V and R339L USVs. A SARS-CoV1 R337A;R339A double substitution showed decreased helicase activity (Jia et al., 2019). It
is, therefore, likely that R337L and R339L substitutions in SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 reduced
enzyme activity. Another interesting substitution involves the R567, which is important for
NTP hydrolysis in SARS-CoV-1 nsp13 (Jia et al., 2019). An R567I substitution occurs in the
context of the double substitution USV (V456F;R567I; GISAID dataset count=1) and may
reduce SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 helicase activity.

Non-structural Protein 14 Proofreading Exoribonuclease (nsp14): nsp14 is a 527-residue
protein that acts as both a proofreading exoribonuclease and a methyltransferase to
synthesize the N7-methyl-guanine cap 5’ for the mRNA-like genome (Khailany, Safdar, &
Ozaslan, 2020; Shannon et al., 2020). It is encoded as part of polyprotein pp1ab and is
excised by nsp5. Following excision, it is thought to form a 1:1 complex with non-structural
protein 10 (nsp10) to proofread newly formed RNAs synthesized by the RdRp
heterotetramer (Eckerle et al., 2010). (N.B.: nsp10 also forms a heterocomplex with nsp16,
for which there is an experimental structure available from the PDB (see nsp10/nsp16
section below)). At the time of writing there were no publicly available structures of SARSCoV-2 nsp14. A computed homology model was used to analyze the evolution of nsp14,
based on the structure of SARS-CoV-1 nsp14 (PDB ID 5C8S (Ma et al., 2015)), with which
it shares ~95% sequence identity (Fig. nsp14). Superposition of the methyltransferase
catalytic centers of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 and SARS-CoV-1 nsp14 revealed 100%
conservation of active site residues, including both the cap binding residues (N306, C309,
R310, W385, N386, N422, and F426) and the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding
residues (D352, Q354, F367, Y368, and W385). The active site of the exoribonuclease
proofreading domain of nsp14 contains a D-E-D-D-H motif (D90, E92, D243, D273, H268),
which is identical to the corresponding motif found in SARS-CoV-1 Nps14 (Ma et al.,
2015).
Overall substitution trends for nsp14 and energetics analysis results are summarized in
Tables 1 and 2. A320V (conservative, core) was the most common substitution, occurring
in six USVs with a total GISAID dataset count of 327. A320V also occurred in four double
substitution USVs (A320V/D496N, A320V/K349N, A320V/P355S, A320V/A323S). F233L
(conservative, core) was the second most common substitution, occurring in 4 USVs, and
observed in 273 independently sequenced genomes. It occurred in both a single
substitution USV (F233L) and in three double substitution USVs (F233L/A360V,
A23S/F233L, F233L/S461P). Two USVs (sequenced in same geographic location) had
surprisingly large numbers of amino acid changes and very large ∆∆GApp values. The first
had five substitutions (T193K/D352E/D358E/Y361K/E364Q), none of which were observed
in

USVs.
The
other
had

only P70L being observed in another USV as a single substitution. Given the large number
of substitutions, extremely unfavorable apparent stabilization energy changes
(∆∆GApp~20 REU and ~56REU, respectively), and the fact that they were detected only
once, we believe that both of these USVs are the result of sequencing artifacts. No
substitutions were observed within the active site of the exoribonuclease proofreading
domain. The methyltransferase domain displayed a high level of conservation with only
three of 12 active site residues substituted. Two guanine cap binding residues (N306 and
F426) were found substituted, with N306S (conservative, surface) observed as a single

amino acid change and F426L observed once in the double-substitution USV F426L;S448Y.
One SAM binding residue was substituted: Q354H (non-conservative, boundary) was
observed in five independently sequenced viral genomes.
While we did not generate structural models of the nsp14/nsp10 heterodimer, the
structure of SARS-CoV-1 nsp14/nsp10 heterodimer (PDB ID 5C8S (Ma et al., 2015))
allowed us to predict which SARS-CoV-2 amino acid changes may affect nsp10/nsp14
heterodimer formation. Sixteen nsp14 sites of substitution (T5, P24, H26, L27, K47, M62,
N67, Y69, V101, N129, T131, K196, V199, I201, P203, and F217, giving a total of 21 distinct
substitutions) and eight nsp10 sites of substitution (T12, A18, A20, Y30, A32, I81, K93, and
K95, giving a total of 13 distinct substitutions) were mapped to the putative nsp14/nsp10
interface, of which 18 were conservative and 16 were non-conservative. The most
prevalent substitutions were T12 (surface, T12I and T12N), A32 (surface, A32S and A32V),
H26Y (surface), and P203 (surface, P203L and P203S).

Non-structural Proteins 10 and 16 Methyltransferase (nsp10/nsp16): Non-structural
proteins nsp10 and nsp16 are both found within pp1ab, from which they are excised by
nsp5. Together, nsp10 and nsp16 form a stable heterodimer that functions as a
methyltransferase, acting on the 2’ OH of the ribose of the first nucleotide of the viral
genome (i.e., 5′(m7Gp)(ppAm)[pN]n, where Am denotes 2′-O-ribose methyl-adenosine).
This process renders the viral cap structure indistinguishable from that of eukaryotic cap1, thereby disguising the viral genome so that it resembles cellular RNAs typically found
in multicellular organisms and protecting the viral genome from cellular 5’ exonucleases.
Enzyme activity of nsp16 depends on SAM as a cofactor, which donates the methyl group
from the methionine group for transfer to the ribose of the capped viral RNA (Y. Chen et
al., 2011). (N.B.: Capping of the viral RNA is carried out by the N7-guanine
methyltransferase domain of nsp14 (Ma et al., 2015)). The structure of the SARS-CoV-2
nsp10/nsp16 heterodimer (PDB ID 6WVN (Minasov et al., 2020)) revealed a heterodimer
extremely similar to that of its SARS-CoV-1 homolog (sequence Identities ~93% (for
nsp10) and ~98% (for nsp16); r.m.s.d.~1.1Å for PDB ID 6WVN versus PDB ID 2XYQ
(Decroly et al., 2011)).
The SAM binding site includes residues N43, G71, G73, G81, D99 (3 interactions), D114,
C115, D130, and M131 (Rosas-Lemus et al., 2020). The N7-methyl-GpppA binding site
consists of residues K24, C25, L27, Y30 (2 interactions), K46, Y132, K137 (2 interactions),
K170, T172, E173, H174, S201 (2 interactions), and S202 (4 interactions). Efficient catalytic
activity of nsp16 depends on heterodimerization with nsp10, which possesses two zincbinding motifs (PDB ID 6ZCT (Rogstam et al., 2020)). The two Zn++-binding sites of nsp10
are composed of residues C74, C77, H83, and C90; and C117, C120, C128, and C130,
respectively.
Polar interactions within the nsp10/nsp16 interface include nsp10:L45-nsp16:Q87;
nsp10:G94-nsp16:R86; nsp10:K93-nsp16:S105; nsp10:K43-nsp16:K138; nsp10:Y96nsp16:A83; and nsp10:A71/G94-nsp16:D106. There is also a salt bridge between H80 and
D102 in the SARS-CoV-1 nsp10/nsp16 heterodimer (Y. Chen et al., 2011). At the time of
analysis, there was one PDB structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 alone (PDB ID 6ZCT (Rogstam
et al., 2020)). A dozen co-crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp16 heterodimer
are available from the PDB, together with nearly 20 structures of nsp10/nsp16 from SARSCoV-1 and MERS CoV. In the case of SARS-CoV-1, nsp10 also forms a heterodimer with
nsp14 (e.g., PDB ID 5C8S (Ma et al., 2015)). Evolutionary analyses of the nsp10/nsp16
heterodimer that follow were carried out using PDB ID 6WVN (Fig. nsp10/nsp16).
Overall substitution trends for nsp10 and nsp16 and energetics analysis results are
summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Several observed substitutions are noteworthy. Two USVs
involving SAM binding residues in nsp16 include D99N (non-conservative; core) and

D114G (non-conservative; surface), both of which may alter binding affinity to the SAM
moiety due to loss of the negative charge upon substitution. Indeed, modeling indicates
reduced stability (GApp~7REU in the case of D114G). M131I (conservative; boundary)
may also affect SAM binding. By perturbing SAM binding, these substitutions may
influence the ability of the enzyme to methylate the first ribose of the viral cap, although
these predictions await experimental testing. USVs involving 7-methyl-GpppA binding
residues in nsp16 include K24N (non-conservative; surface), D75Y (non-conservative;
surface), and S202F (non-conservative; boundary). All of these substitutions had
destabilizing effects, with GApp >7 REU for S202F. D75Y appears to form a new
hydrogen bond with the 7-methyl-GpppA, which would slightly shift its position in the
binding pocket (Fig. nsp10/nsp16). Only one nsp10 USV affected the Zn++-binding residue
C130 (C130S;D131H), which would be unlikely to abrogate cation binding.
A number of sites near the protein-protein interface were also substituted, any one of
which may affect heterodimer stability, including nsp10 residues K43, T47, T58, F68, and
K93; and nsp16 residues P37, G39, M41, V44, T48, G77, V78, P80, R86, T91, D108, T110,
M247, and P251. Nine of the interfacial substitutions were conservative and mildly
destabilizing, although nsp16 M247I had a more pronounced effect with GApp >10 REU.
Of the 16 non-conservative interfacial substitutions V78G was most common, appearing
in 42 GISAID sequences and three USVs, in two cases occurring concurrently with amino
acid changes for P80 (boundary) (P80A and P80L), suggesting that greater flexibility in
this region of the protein may be tolerated. Four substitutions were identified that could
introduce new hydrogen bonds spanning the heterodimer interface (P37S, G39S, M41T,
and G77R), although each of these substitutions appears mildly destabilizing as judged
by the results of GApp calculations with Rosetta.

Structural Spike Surface Glycoprotein (S-protein): The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Sprotein) is a membrane-anchored homotrimeric class I fusion protein, that is 1273
residues in length and contains 22 N-linked glycosylation sites (Watanabe, Allen, Wrapp,
McLellan, & Crispin, 2020) per monomer (Fig. S-protein A). The S-protein supports viral
entry via host cell attachment and virion-host membrane fusion. Attachment to a host cell
is mediated through the interaction of the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD,
located in domain S1) with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (Fig. Sprotein B). Fusion of the virion to the host cell membrane occurs after cleavage of the Sprotein between the S1 and S2 domains, with an additional cleavage (S2’) occurring near
the fusion peptide (FP) domain, which is responsible for anchoring to the host cell
membrane.
The first experimental structures of the S-protein deposited to the PDB include the prefusion state of the S-protein in two conformations–one with all three RBDs in a closed
conformation (PDB ID 6VXX (Walls et al., 2020)) and one with RBD protruding upwards
(PDB ID 6VSB (Wrapp et al., 2020)). A subsequently deposited PDB structure (PDB ID 6X2B
(Henderson et al., 2020)) revealed two upwards protruding RBDs; however, only a single
RBD is necessary for ACE2 binding. It is not yet known if protrusion of the RBD from the
S-protein trimer is necessary for binding to ACE2 or, as a recent meta-analysis of cryo-EM
data suggests (Melero et al., 2020) that interconversion of the RBD between closed and
open states represents an intrinsic property of the S-protein. Structures of the S-protein
RBD were determined by X-ray crystallography early in the pandemic, both bound to fulllength ACE2 receptor (PDB ID 6M17 (Yan et al., 2020)) and bound to relevant ACE2 binding
domains (PDB ID 6M0J (Lan et al., 2020); PDB ID 6LZG (Q. Wang, Y. Zhang, et al., 2020)).
Overall substitution trends for the S-protein and energetics analysis results are
summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The most commonly observed amino acid change from
the reference sequence was D614G, a non-conservative substitution occurring in the SD2
boundary region of the S1 domain (Fig. S-protein C). This substitution appears 21,014
times as a single point substitution and 3,523 times in double or multi-point substitution
contexts, accounting for ~68% (805/1190) of all USVs and ~74% (24,537/33,290) of all
sequenced genomes downloaded from GISAID. While this substitution is estimated to be
slightly destabilizing versus the reference sequence (~+0.6 REU), it seems to have
emerged early in the pandemic and G614 is now the dominant form of the S-protein
worldwide (Korber et al., 2020). The question of if and why G614 is preferred versus D614
continues to be debated. It has been hypothesized that this substitution confers increased
infectivity, possibly by reducing the pre-emptive shedding of the S1 domain and
increasing the total amount of S-protein incorporated into virions (Zhang et al., 2020). A
recent cryo-EM-based structural characterization of an engineered D614G S-protein
revealed a significantly increased population of conformations in which RBDs are in the

open state (PDB ID 6XS6 (Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020)). Interestingly, the measured binding
affinity of the G614 spike for ACE2 was slightly lower compared to the D614 variant. The
increased population of open conformations in G614 was correlated with loss of interprotomer contacts in the trimeric spike between D614 from the S1 domain and T859 from
the S2 domain this contact was postulated to be a “latch” that favors the closed state (Fig.
S-protein C).
Definitive elucidation of the effects of D614G and other substitutions on S-protein stability
would require measuring impacts on the stability of all states (pre-fusion, post-fusion,
open, closed). Moreover, amino acid changes may impact the structure and stability of
complexes with binding partners (ACE2 and other possible co-receptors) and proteases
responsible for S-protein cleavage. In this work, we limited our analysis of substitutions
to two S-protein PDB structures available in June 2020: a pre-fusion all-closed RBD
conformation (PDB ID 6VXX (Walls et al., 2020)), and the RBD-ACE2 complex (PDB ID 6M17
(Yan et al., 2020)). Our methodology could be extended to other structures that continue
to be determined at a fast clip, including antibody-bound or inhibitor-bound structures.
Receptor Binding Domain Substitutions: The most prevalent RBD substitution is the
double substitution D614G;T478I (count=57), which is located in an RBD substitution that
includes D614G;S477N (count=43), G476S (count=9), and V483A (count=28). These three
residues are located in a loop region at the edge of the RBD-ACE2 binding interface. The
substitutions were calculated to be destabilizing. Further experimental work will be
required to understand how these substitutions might affect the binding of the RBD to
ACE2.
Cleavage-site Substitutions: It was recognized early on in the pandemic that the S-protein
possesses a potential furin cleavage site (residue 681-PRRAR/SV-residue687). Furin
cleavage is thought to represent another mechanism for transition into a fusioncompatible state (Johnson et al., 2020), thereby contributing to virulence. However, the
virus was still found to be infectious upon deletion of the furin cleavage site, indicating
that it may not be required for viral entry (Walls et al., 2020) but may affect replication
kinetics (Johnson et al., 2020). In that context, it is remarkable that several substitutions
are observed within the putative furin cleavage site (P681L/S/H, R682Q/W, R683P/Q,
A684T/S/V, S686G). Others have reported that amino acid changes occurred in the furin
cleavage site (Xing, Li, Gao, & Dong, 2020). Furin cleavage requires a polybasic motif, but
the enzyme is not very stringent, suggesting that these altered sites may still be
proteolytically cleaved (Shiryaev et al., 2013).
Prior to virus entry, the S-protein undergoes a second cleavage at the S2’ site (residue
811-KPSKR/SFI-residue 818), which exposes the fusion peptide. This component in the S2

21

domain fusion machinery attaches to the host cell membrane to initiate membrane fusion.
The identity of the enzyme(s) responsible for the cleavage at this site is not known,
although given the cleavage site sequence it is thought that it is a furin-like enzyme
(Coutard et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020). We identified several substitutions within the
S2’ cleavage domain, including P812L/S/T, S813I/G, F817L, I818S/V. Further experimental
study of these substitutions and the replication properties of these altered viruses may
provide insight into the role played by furin cleavage in SARS-CoV-2 infection and
virulence.
Fusion Machinery Substitutions: Following cleavage at the S2’ site, the S-protein fuses the
viral membrane with the host cell endosomal membrane. S2’ cleavage exposes the fusion
peptide (loosely defined as residues 816-855), which then inserts into the host cell
membrane. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptide sequences are very similar
(~93% sequence homology) (Tang, Bidon, Jaimes, Whittaker, & Daniel, 2020). Our
analyses, however, identified many USVs in which amino acid changes in this segment
occurred during the pandemic (i.e., L821I, L822F, K825R, V826L, T827I, L828P, A829T,
D830G/A, A831V/S/T, G832C/S, F833S, I834T). The active conformation and mode of
insertion of the SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptide have not been experimentally characterized,
making the impact of these substitutions impossible to assess. It may be significant that
many of the observed amino acid changes in the fusion peptide are conservative.
A partial structure of the post-fusion state of the S-protein was determined early in the
pandemic (PDB ID 6LXT (Xia et al., 2020)). During the final stages of membrane fusion, the
HR1 and HR2 domains of class I fusion proteins assemble into a 6-helix bundle (Tang et
al., 2020). HR2 sequences of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are identical. Differences in
HR1 sequences between the two viruses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 HR2 makes stronger
interactions with HR1 (Xia et al., 2020). Several substitutions occur on the solvent
accessible surface of the HR1 domain (e.g., D936Y, S943P, S939F) and do not seem to
participate in stabilizing interactions with HR2. It is, therefore, unclear how these nonconservative amino acid changes might affect the packing or stability of the post-fusion
S-protein. Other residues in HR2 undergoing substitutions during the pandemic (e.g.,
K1073N, V1176F) or in the transmembrane or cytoplasmic tail domains (e.g., G1219C,
P1263L) are not present in the post-fusion structure of the 6-helix bundle. Future
experimental work to determine the conformation of the FP, HR1, HR2, and TM domains
along the entire membrane fusion pathway should help to elucidate substitutions
affecting these segments of the S-protein.
N-terminal Domain Substitutions: The N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S-protein includes
the first ~300 residues. Thus far, the function of the NTD has not been experimentally
characterized. It is the target of neutralizing antibodies obtained from convalescent serum

of individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Chi et al., 2020), and the site of many
substitutions identified in this work. Interestingly, the S-protein NTD of MERS-CoV utilizes
sugar-binding receptors as a secondary means of interaction with host cells. Awasthi and
co-workers have proposed that the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein NTD may do the same. Their
computational modelling results suggest that that the NTD 4-5 (69-HVSGTNGTKRF-79)
and 14-15 (243-ALHRSYLTPGDSSSGWTAGA-262) loop regions form a sialosidebinding pocket that would support engagement of host cell sialic acid moieties (Awasthi
et al., 2020). Our analyses documented that virtually all of the residues in these loops
underwent amino acid changes during the pandemic (4-5: H69Y, V70F, S71F/Y,
G72R/E/W, T73I, N74K, G75R/V/D, T76I, K77M/N, R78M/K, F79I; 14-15: A243S/V,
H245Y/R, R246I/S/K, S247R/N/I, Y248S, L249S/F, T250N, P251S/H/L, G252S, D253G/Y,
S254F, S255F/P, S256P, G257S/R, W258L, A260S/V, G261V/S/D/R, A262S/T).
Unfortunately, these loop regions are largely absent from the 3DEM structures used in
our analysis (PDB ID 6VXX (Walls et al., 2020); PDB ID 6VSB (Wrapp et al., 2020)),
presumably because they are largely unstructured. Notwithstanding the paucity of 3D
structural information, many of these substitutions would likely disrupt stabilizing
electrostatic interactions between NTD and sialic acid derivatives postulated by Awasthi
and coworkers (Awasthi et al., 2020). Experimental work will be required to evaluate SARSCoV-2 NTD interactions with sialic acid and how amino acid changes in the NTD affects
binding to host cells.

it within the viral envelope. The N-terminal domain (NTD) is responsible for nucleotide
binding, while the C-terminal domain (CTD) is responsible for dimerization (Kang et al.,
2020). They are connected by a serine/arginine-rich (SR) linker region that is thought to
be intrinsically disordered on the basis of amino acid composition. Experimental
structures for the N- and C-terminal domains of the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein (PDB ID 6VYO
(Chang, 2020); PDB ID 6YUN (Zinzula et al., 2020)) were used for the evolutionary analysis
(Fig. N-protein). Residues for which 3D structural information were not available include
1-48, 174-247, and 365-422.
Overall substitution trends for the N-protein and energetics analysis results are
summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The most frequently observed USV (R203K/G204R)
observed 11,425 times affects two residues within the SR linker region for which there is
no 3D structural information. Thereafter, R203K (conservative, atomic coordinates not
present in either PDB structure) is the most common substitution, observed 13,130 times,
and occurring in 272 other USVs. The R203K/G204R double substitution also appears in a
majority of the triple point substitutions (228/237 triples, 35/36 quadruples, 1/2
quintuples). Another interesting USV includes the 5-point substitution,
R36Q/R203K/G204R/T135I/K373N). The NTD contains several basic residues (Arginine
and Lysine) that are located in the finger subdomain and appear likely to interact with the
RNA. Several substitutions in these finger-domain residues were observed in various USVs
(e.g., R92S, R93L, R88L). If and how these may affect RNA-binding remains to be
investigated.

Structural Protein Ion Channel Envelope Protein (E-protein): The integral membrane Eprotein is the smallest of the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (75 residues). It plays
important roles in virus-like particle production and maturation. Coronavirus E-proteins
are co-translationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to
Golgi complexes (Ruch & Machamer, 2012). Although it is abundantly expressed within
the cell, only a modest number of copies are actually incorporated into the viral envelope
(estimated number/virion~20 for SARS-CoV-1, (DeDiego et al., 2007)). Instead, most of
the protein participates in virion assembly and budding together with the SARS-CoV-2
integral membrane M-protein (also a virion structural protein). Additional functions of the
E-protein are thought to include, preventing M-protein aggregation and inducing
membrane curvature (Schoeman & Fielding, 2019). Recombinant coronaviruses lacking Eproteins display weakened maturation, reduced viral titers, or yield incompetent progeny,
highlighting its role in maintaining virion integrity.
The E-protein consists of a shorter hydrophilic N-terminal segment, a longer hydrophobic
transmembrane domain (TMD), and a hydrophilic C-terminal domain. An amphipathic αhelix within the TMD oligomerizes into an homopentameric arrangement perpendicular
to the plane of the lipid bilayer forming an ion-conducting viroporin (Schoeman &
Fielding, 2019). Residues lining the pore include N15, L19, A22, F26, T30, I33, and L37. The
NMR structure of the SARS-CoV-1 E-protein (PDB ID 5X29 (Surya, Li, & Torres, 2018))
served as the template for generating the computed structural model of the SARS-CoV-2
E-protein that was used for analyzing its evolution in 3D (Fig. E-protein). The N-terminal
seven residues and the C-terminal ten residues were omitted from the homology model,
because they were not reported in the SARS-CoV-1 NMR structure.
Overall substitution trends for the E-protein and energetics analysis results are
summarized in Tables 1 and 2. S68F (non-conservative, structural location unknown) is the
most common USV, observed 107 times in the GISAID dataset. The most intriguing
changes in the protein are L37R and L37H USVs, located near the entrance to the pore
(Fig. E-protein). The changes of Leucine to Arginine or Histidine are notable because the
canonical transmembrane domain lacks charged residues. The SARS-CoV-1 E-protein is
preferentially selective for cations, although it can transport anions (Verdia-Baguena et
al., 2012). Substitution of L37 to a positively charged residue may affect ion passage
selectivity and/or its ability to transport ions.
SARS-CoV-1 E-protein is N-linked glycosylated at N66 (S. C. Chen, Lo, Ma, & Li, 2009). At
the time of writing, there were no published reports pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 E-protein
glycosylation. The corresponding residue in SARS-CoV-2 E-protein is N66, which
underwent substitution to Histidine in a single USV (N66H) that would abrogate
glycosylation. Observed amino acid substitutions involving loss or gain of other potential

Structural Integral Membrane Protein (M-protein): The integral membrane
M-protein (222 residues in length) is the most abundant structural protein in the SARSCoV-1 virion (Siu et al., 2008). It is co-translationally inserted into the ER and transported
to Golgi complexes (S. C. Chen et al., 2009), where it is responsible for directing virus
assembly and budding via interactions with E-, N-, and S-proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 Mprotein is predicted to consist of a small glycosylated amino-terminal ectodomain, a
triple-membrane spanning domain, and a carboxyl-terminal endodomain that extends 68 nm into the viral particle. The C-terminal portion of coronaviral M-proteins bind to the
N-protein within the cell membrane of the ER or Golgi complex, stabilizing the
nucleocapsid and the core of the virion. M-proteins also interacts with the E-protein to
trigger budding, and with the S-protein for incorporation into virions (Tseng, Chang,
Wang, Huang, & Wang, 2013). Following assembly, virions are transported to the cell
surface and released via exocytosis. The M-protein is believed to exist as a dimer in the
cell membrane and may adopt two conformations that allow it to bend the membrane
and interact with N-protein/RNA RNP (Neuman et al., 2011). Sequence alignment of
SARS-CoV-2 M-protein to its SARS-CoV-1 homolog revealed high sequence identity
(~90%). The M-protein structural model used for analyzing evolution in 3D was computed
by the David Baker Laboratory during a CASP competition (CASP-C1906 Stage 2, Fig. MProtein).
Overall substitution trends for the M-protein and energetics analysis results are
summarized in Tables 1 and 2. T175M (non-conservative, surface) is the most common
USV, observed 746 times in the GISAID data set (~39% of the observed variant Mproteins). An N5S substitution affects the sole N-linked glycosylation site in the small
ectodomain. Given that M-protein glycosylation is not essential for maintaining virion
morphology or growth kinetics (Voss et al., 2009), it is unclear if M-protein function is
affected by the N5S substitution.

Implications for the Ongoing Pandemic and Discovery and Development of Effective
Countermeasures
Our analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences archived by GISAID documented that
every one of the 29 study proteins underwent amino acid changes versus the original
reference sequence during the first six months of the pandemic. Most of these
substitutions occurred infrequently. Approximately two thirds of the substitutions were
non-conservative, and most appear to have arisen from single or double nucleotide
changes in the RNA genome. Computational 3D structure modeling of the USVs
demonstrated that substitutions primarily occurred in the boundary layers and the
surfaces of the viral proteins. The vast majority of the amino acid changes appear to be
moderately destabilizing, as judged by the results of energetics (ΔΔGApp) calculations.
Given that most of the viral genomes archived by GISAID were obtained from samples
provided by infected individuals, we believe that the viruses and hence the viral proteins
were functional and capable of causing disease in humans. Where multiple substitutions
were detected in a USV, we believe that most were the product of cumulative changes. At
least one of the observed amino acid changes in multi-substitution USVs was almost
always detected as a single substitution in another USV derived from a sample collected
earlier in the pandemic. There is every reason to believe that the pool of viruses circulating
in humans and some mammals (e.g., Mustela lutreola or European mink) around the world
today will continue to diverge from the reference sequence. We have made 3D structure
models of 7,462 USVs and our analysis results freely available under the most permissive
Creative Commons license to facilitate the work of research groups using experimental
and computational tools to characterize SARS-CoV-2 protein function and study the
structural and functional consequences of the myriad substitutions observed during the
first half of 2020.
Some, certainly not all, of the 29 viral proteins analyzed herein represent promising targets
for discovery and development of small-molecule anti-viral agents. At the time of writing,
one small-molecule drug (remdesivir targeting the RdRp) has received full approval from
the US FDA. This compound was originally discovered during the search for an Ebola virus
therapeutic. Although it failed to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials for Ebola victims,
the safety profile encouraged the sponsor company (Gilead Sciences Inc.) to successfully
repurposed the drug for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Open access to
PDB structures of remdesivir bound to the RdRp sets the stage for structure-guided
discovery of second generation nucleoside analogs with superior potency and/or
selectivity, more desirable drug-like properties, or better Absorption-DistributionMetabolism-Excretion profiles (e.g., improved oral bioavailability to avoid intravenous
administration) (Westbrook, Soskind, Hudson, & Burley, 2020). Open access to our
computed 3D structural models of 840 RdRp USVs will provide useful information that

may enable drug hunting teams to anticipate potential sources of drug resistance during
selection for candidates slated for in vitro pre-clinical development studies.
Open access to PDB structures of other essential SARS-CoV-2 enzymes (and their closely
related SARS-CoV-1 homologs) have already facilitated initiation of structure-guided drug
discovery campaigns for PLPro, nsp5, nsp13, nsp14, and nsp10/nsp16. As for the RdRp,
free availability of computed 3D structural models of nearly 1,500 USVs may provide
useful information pertaining to potential causes of drug resistance. Knowledge of
sequence (and 3D structure) variation during the pandemic could also be used to
prioritize these potential drug targets using quantitative assessments of active site
conservation. The best drug discovery targets could be those proteins observed to
undergo the fewest amino acid changes in their active (or drug-binding) site during the
first six months of the pandemic. It is also possible that inhibitors making contacts with
residues that are not engaged by substrates will be more susceptible to the emergence
of drug resistance.
The S-protein is the target of both monoclonal antibodies (for passive immunization) and
vaccines. At the time of writing, a number of monoclonal antibodies had already received
Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the US FDA (e.g., bamlanivimab; sponsor
company Eli Lilly and Co.). EUAs for one or more vaccines can be reasonably expected
before the end of 2020. Open access to a host of PDB structures of the S-protein in various
conformational states and in complexes with host cell proteins and Fab fragments of
monoclonal antibodies will facilitate the work of research teams focused on discovery and
development of second generation monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Free availability
of 689 3D structural models of S-protein USVs may provide insights into potential efficacy
failures due to amino acid changes in the S-protein that interfere with viral antigen
recognition by antibodies (monoclonal or humoral) or T-cells while preserving ACE2
receptor binding.

Postscript
Unwillingness in virtually every country to prepare adequately for the possibility that a
third coronavirus would jump the species barrier has dealt humanity a devastating blow.
Global fatalities attributed to the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in the early 2000s numbered only
774 (total number of cases=8,098), and there were no deaths in the US. Had the virus
rendered asymptomatic individuals infectious, however, we now know that the situation
would have been catastrophically worse. The world was fortunate once again, relatively
speaking, when MERS-CoV struck nearly a decade after SARS-CoV-1. From 2012 through
May 31, 2019, MERS-CoV infected 2,442 individuals and killed 842 worldwide. The virus is
currently circulating in dromedary camels in Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia,
with no end to human infections in sight and no effective anti-viral therapies or vaccines
available.
Analyzing coronavirus protein evolution in 3D provides a sobering lesson regarding the
potential value of proper pandemic preparedness. nsp5 amino acid sequences are highly
conserved across all known coronaviruses. For example, SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 is 95% identical
in amino acid sequence to that of SARS-CoV-1. nsp5 3D structures are also highly
conserved across all known coronaviruses. Indeed, the nsp5 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV-1 are extremely similar in 3D structure (α-carbon r.m.s.d.~0.8Å; Fig. SARS-CoV1/SARS-COV-2). The residues lining the active site are identical and the active sites are
structurally similar (non-hydrogen atom r.m.s.d.<0.5Å), precisely because they recognize
virtually identical (if not identical) peptide cleavage substrates during viral polyprotein
processing. We had every opportunity in the wake of the SARS-CoV-1 medical emergency
to discover and develop a drug targeting SARS-CoV-1 nsp5 and other coronavirus main
proteases. Structure-guided approaches using PDB ID 1Q2W (Pollack, 2003) and the many
structures of SARS-CoV-1 nsp5 subsequently released by the PDB would almost certainly
have yielded one (possibly more) potent and selective enzyme inhibitor(s) with good
drug-like properties and an acceptable safety profile.
While it may have appeared economically rational to consign SARS-CoV-1 (and the
possibility of serious coronavirus outbreaks in humans) to the annals of history, hindsight
tells us otherwise. Economists would describe this a “failure of the free market” for
emergency medicines. With no clear prospect of income from drugs targeting future
epidemics that may never come and no additional incentives provided by public health
authorities, biopharmaceutical companies focused on business as usual. The emergence
of MERS-CoV and its ongoing persistence in endemic areas should have served as
additional warnings that emerging coronavirus pandemics represent a very real and
present danger to humanity. A safe and effective drug targeting SARS-CoV-1 nsp5 would
almost certainly be working today for SARS-CoV-2! Simply put, an investment of a few

hundred million US$ in discovering and developing SARS-CoV-1 nsp5 inhibitors, and
eventually drugs in the 2000s, could today have already saved more than a million lives
and prevented tens of trillions of US$ in global economic losses (Burley, 2020).
Rising numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths worldwide as we approach the
northern hemisphere winter of 2020-2021 show that we must prepare for the next
coronavirus outbreak. The science and the unmet medical needs are clear. It is time for
governments, industry, and NGOs to confront the failure of the free market head-on. We
scientists have it within our power to present policy makers with viable options that could
make all the difference when (it’s no longer a matter of if) another coronavirus jumps the
species barrier to human.

Materials and Methods
SARS-CoV-2 Study Protein Sequences: Pre-aligned protein sequences were downloaded
in FASTA format from the GISAID website (gisaid.org) (Elbe & Buckland-Merrett, 2017;
Shu & McCauley, 2017) on June 25th 2020. Sequence alignments for each of the SARSCoV-2 proteins (hereafter study proteins) were constructed by removing non-human
sequences from the alignment; removing truncated sequences; removing incompletely
determined sequences (i.e., those with one or more “X” in lieu of an amino acid one-letter
code); and eliminating duplicates. Study protein sequences made public by researchers in
the People’s Republic of China on January 10th 2020 (GenBank accession code
MN908947.3) (Wu et al., 2020) were defined as the “reference sequence” for each
individual study protein and all unique sequence variant (USV) or amino acid substituted
forms of individual study proteins were compared with their respective reference
sequence. We have assumed that none of observed USVs yielded study proteins that
either failed to fold or lost necessary biochemical functionality for other reasons, because
it is likely given the timing of specimen collection that all of the viral RNAs were isolated
from infected individuals and are, therefore, presumed to have been infectious. For
sequence identity calculations, GenBank accession code AY278741.1 was used as the
source of SARS-CoV-1 protein reference sequences.
Experimentally-determined Structures of Study Proteins from the PDB Archive: Atomic
coordinates for the experimental structures of 13 study proteins were downloaded from
the PDB archive via the RCSB PDB website (RCSB.org), including nsp3b (part of nsp3) (PDB
ID 6WEY (Frick, Virdi, Vuksanovic, Dahal, & Silvaggi, 2020)), Papain-like Proteinase (part of
nsp3) (PLPro; PDB ID 6WUU (Rut et al., 2020)), nsp5 (PDB ID 6LU7 (Jin et al., 2020)), nsp7
(PDB IDs 7BV1 and 7BV2 (Yin et al., 2020), nsp8 (PDB IDs 7BV1 and 7BV2 (Yin et al., 2020)),
nsp9 (PDB ID 6WXD (Littler, Gully, Colson, & Rossjohn, 2020)), nsp10 (PDB ID 6WVN
(Minasov et al., 2020)), nsp12 (PDB IDs 7BV1 and 7BV2 (Yin et al., 2020)), nsp13 (PDB ID
6ZSL, (Newman, 2020)), nsp15 (PDB ID 6VWW (Y. Kim et al., 2020)), nsp16 (PDB ID 6WVN
(Minasov et al., 2020)), S-protein (PDB ID 6VXX (Walls et al., 2020); PDB ID 6M17 (Yan et
al., 2020)), Orf3a (PDB ID 6XDC (Kern et al., 2020)), and the N-protein (PDB ID 6VYO
(Chang, 2020); PDB ID 6YUN (Zinzula et al., 2020)).
Computed Structural Models of Study Proteins: In three cases, computed structural
models for study proteins were downloaded from the Robetta-based predictions from the
website for Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Disease
(https://www.ssgcid.org/cttdb/molecularmodel_list/?organism__icontains=COVID-19),
including
nsp1
(https://robetta.bakerlab.org/domain.php?id=15554),

The computed structural model for the SARS-CoV-2 E-protein were generated using the
solution state NMR structure of the SARS-CoV-1 E-protein embedded in lyso-myristoyl
phosphatidylglycerol micelles (PDB ID 5X29, model 1 (Surya et al., 2018)) as a template,
and substituting differing residues using the MUTATE feature of VMD (Humphrey, Dalke,
& Schulten, 1996). The structural model was then subjected to 10,000 steps of energy
minimization in vacuum using NAMD 2.13 (Phillips et al., 2020) and the CHARMM 36 force
field (MacKerell Jr. et al., 1998).
Swiss-Model (Waterhouse et al., 2018) was the source of computed structural models of
three study proteins, including nsp3a using 77% sequence identical template SARS-CoV1 nsp3a (part of nsp3) (PDB ID 2GRI (Serrano et al., 2007)); nsp3c (part of nsp3) using 75%
sequence identical template SARS-CoV-1 nsp3c (part of nsp3) (PDB ID 2W2G (Tan et al.,
2009)); and nsp3e (part of nsp3) using ~81% identical template SARS-CoV-1 nsp3e (part
of nsp3) (PDB ID 2K87 (Serrano et al., 2009)).
Computed structural models for the eight remaining study proteins were obtained from
the
Rosetta-based
Baker
group
predictions
(TS131)
CASP
website
(https://predictioncenter.org/caspcommons/targetlist.cgi; Model 1 was chosen),
including nsp2, nsp3a (part of nsp3), UNK (part of nsp3), nsp4, nsp6, the M-protein, Orf6,
Orf7b, and Orf8.
nsp11, Orf9b, Orf14, and hypothetical protein Orf10 were excluded from consideration
owing to lack of sequence and/or 3D structure data.
Molecular Visualization and Graphics: The RCSB Protein Data Bank web-native molecular
graphics tool (Mol*; (Sehnal, Rose, Koca, Burley, & Velankar, 2018)) was used for visual
inspection and comparison of reference and amino-acid-substitute study proteins. Spacefilling representation figures were generated using Illustrate (Goodsell, Autin, & Olson,
2019). Ribbon/atomic stick figure representation figures were generated using Mol* and
PyMOL (DeLano, 2002).
Rosetta-based Analyses of Substitution Location(s), Conservation, and Energetics:
PyRosetta (Chaudhury, Lyskov, & Gray, 2010) was used to analyze each study protein and
its observed USVs. All residue pairs with Cα-Cα distance <5.5Å were considered neighbors,
and residue pairs with Cα-Cα distance <11Å were also considered neighbors if their Cα-Cβ
vectors were at an angle <75°. Residue layer identifications were performed on reference
(rather than substituted) study-protein structures, based on side chain neighbors within a
cone centered on the Cα-Cβ vector, which is independent of side chain conformation. The
Layer Determination Factor (LDF) is defined as LDF=((cos(θ)+0.5)/1.5)2/(1 + exp(d - 9)),

where θ is the angle between the Cα-Cβ vector of a given residue and that of a neighbor,
and d is the Cα-Cα distance between residue and neighbor. LDF is summed over nearby
neighbors and if its value is <2, the residue is considered surface. If it is >5.2, the residue
is considered core. Otherwise, it is considered boundary.
Amino acid substitution conservation was determined by whether or not a residue change
stayed within a residue type group as follows: hydrophobic (A, F, I, L, M, V, W, Y),
negatively-charged (D, E), positively-charged (H, K, R), and uncharged hydrophilic (N, Q,
S, T) and any substitution to a residue outside the native residue’s group was considered
non-conservative. Changes to or from Glycine, Proline, or Cysteine were considered nonconservative. Amino acid substitutions in study proteins were identified by alignment with
the reference sequence.
Experimental structures and computed structural models of study proteins were prepared
for computational analyses using the Rosetta FastRelax protocol, employing atom
positional restraints to limit significant changes to backbone geometry. Homooligomeric
proteins were modeled using the symmetric protein modeling framework in Rosetta
(DiMaio, Leaver-Fay, Bradley, Baker, & Andre, 2011). Integral membrane proteins were
modeled using Rosetta membrane protein modeling framework (Alford et al., 2015).
Structural models for study protein USVs were computed by replacing the reference side
chain atomic coordinates in the starting model with those of the substituted amino acid(s)
and performing three rounds of Monte Carlo optimization of rotamers for all side chains
falling within an 8Å radius of the substitution(s), followed by gradient-based energy
minimization of the entire structure, with atom positional restraints to limit significant
changes to backbone geometry. Computed structural model optimizations were
performed with three different combinations of scoring functions based on previous work
(Kellogg, Leaver-Fay, & Baker, 2011), including “hard-hard”, indicating that both side chain
optimization and structure minimization were performed with default van der Waals
repulsion term in the Rosetta scorefunction, “soft-soft” indicating that for both steps, a
different scorefunction was used that has dampened van der Waals repulsion (in this case,
the backbone was entirely prevented from moving during minimization), and “soft-hard”
indicating that the soft-repulsive score function was used for side chain rotamer
optimization, while the hard-repulsive scorefunction was used for energy minimization.
The scorefunctions used were REF2015 (Alford et al., 2017) and REF2015_soft (Kellogg et
al., 2011) for soluble proteins, and franklin2019 (Alford, Fleming, Fleming, & Gray, 2020)
for integral membrane proteins (with a dampened van der Waals repulsion weight in the
case of soft repulsion).

Energetic consequences of amino acid substitutions were determined by performing
identical side chain optimization and energy minimization on both wild-type and
substituted models thrice and subtracting the total energy of the lowest-scoring wildtype model from that of the lowest-scoring substituted model (dividing by the number of
symmetric chains where applicable). The “soft-hard” protocol emerged as the preferred
method because it generated the lowest number of outliers. Only USVs in which a unique
set of substitutions occurred at residue positions that were present in the available studyprotein structures were included in the energy analyses (7,462 USVs).
