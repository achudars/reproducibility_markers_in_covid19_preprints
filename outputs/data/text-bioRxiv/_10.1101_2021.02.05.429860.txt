Abstract

36

A safe and effective vaccine is urgently needed to control the unprecedented

37

COVID-19 pandemic. Four adenovirus vectored vaccines expressing spike (S) protein

38

have advanced into phase 3 trials, with three approved for use. Here, we generated

39

several recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus (AdC7) vaccines expressing S,

40

receptor-binding domain (RBD) or dimeric tandem-repeat RBD (RBD-tr2). We found

41

vaccination via either intramuscular or intranasal route was highly immunogenic in

42

mice to elicit both humoral and cellular (Th1-based) immune responses.

43

AdC7-RBD-tr2 showed higher antibody responses compared with both AdC7-S and

44

AdC7-RBD. Intranasal administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 additionally induced

45

mucosal immunity with neutralizing activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Either

46

single-dose or two-dose mucosal administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 protected mice

47

against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with undetectable subgenomic RNA in lung and

48

relieved lung injury. These results support AdC7-RBD-tr2 as a promising COVID-19

49

vaccine candidate.

Introduction

52

As of 1 February, 2021, the pandemic of COVID-19 has accounted for more than

53

one hundred million laboratory-confirmed cases and two million deaths (1-3). The

54

outbreak is still growing rapidly worldwide (2). Development of a safe and effective

55

COVID-19 vaccine is urgently needed (4). Multiple platforms have been used to

56

develop vaccines against COVID-19, including inactivated virus (5-9), live attenuated

57

virus (10), protein subunit (11-14), virus-like particles (15-17), virus vectored vaccine

58

(18-25), mRNA (26-29) and DNA(30, 31). Both human and chimpanzee adenovirus

59

vectors were widely used for vaccine development. So far, four adenovirus vector

60

vaccines against COVID-19 entered phase III clinical trials, which are ChAdOx1

61

nCoV-19 (University of Oxford and AstraZeneca) (21, 32, 33), Ad5-nCoV (Beijing

62

Institute of Biotechnology and CanSino Biological Inc.) (18, 19), rAd26-S+rAd5-S

63

(Gamaleya Research Institute) (20) and Ad26.COV2.S (J&J, with Janssen

64

Pharmaceutical Companies) (24, 34, 35). Three of them have been approved for use.

65

These recombinant adenovirus vaccines express full-length S protein of SARS-CoV-2.

66

Besides, intranasal administration of a simian Ad36 vectored vaccine expressing

67

prefusion-stabilized full-length S protein conferred mice protection and almost

68

entirely prevented SARS-CoV-2 infections in both the upper and lower respiratory

69

tracts (22).

70

S protein is comprised of S1 and S2 subunit, in which, the receptor binding domain

71

(RBD) of S1 is responsible for recognizing and engaging its host cellular receptor

72

protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and S2 accounts for membrane

73

fusion of virus and host cell (36-39). Therefore, S protein is a major target for the

74

COVID-19 vaccine. Potent neutralizing antibodies are mainly focused on S protein

75

RBD to block the receptor-binding (40-52). Previous studies about feline infectious

76

peritonitis virus (FIPV; a feline coronavirus) found that immunization of cats with

77

recombinant vaccinia virus expressing FIPV S protein resulted in early death after

78

challenge with FIPV. It was thought to be caused by antibody-dependent enhancement

79

(ADE) of FIPV infection (53-55). In addition, sera from animals vaccinated with

80

SARS-CoV S protein could exacerbate virus infection in vitro through ADE, which

81

posed serious safety issues for vaccine development (56-58). Since weakly- or

82

non-neutralizing antibodies are believed as the cause of ADE during both flavivirus

83

and coronavirus infections, concerns should be taken into the vaccine design (59-61).

84

Since most of potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are against RBD of

85

SARS-CoV-2 (62, 63), RBD is an attractive vaccine target. Recombinant

86

SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein vaccines were reported to elicited high neutralizing

87

antibodies in mice without ADE (64, 65). Therefore, we sought to develop COVID-19

88

vaccines based on both full-length S and RBD.

89

Here, we developed virus vectored vaccines based on chimpanzee adenovirus type

90

7 (AdC7), a rare serotype in the human population with the advantage of low level of

91

pre-existing immunity (66, 67). We used a design of tandem repeat RBD-dimer

92

(RBD-tr2) as antigen to increase the immunogenicity. This design has been used in

93

our protein subunit COVID-19 vaccine that has advanced in phase 3 clinical trials (68,

94

69). Our adenovirus-based vaccines are aiming to further enhance the T cell responses.

95

AdC7 expressing full-length or monomeric RBD were generated for comparison.

96

Vaccination via intramuscular and intranasal routes were evaluated to dissect the

97

systemic and mucosal immune responses, with the latter are believed to be beneficial

98

for protection in respiratory system (70, 71). These results will provide crucial

99

guidance for the further clinical trials.

Results

102

We

constructed

three

replication-incompetent AdC7

vaccines

expressing

103

SARS-CoV-2 full-length S, RBD and RBD-tr2, respectively (Fig. 1A). The

104

expression cassettes were inserted into the E1 region of the AdC7 vector with E1 and

105

E3 deletion. Western blot was conducted to confirm antigen expression in HEK 293T

106

cells infected with the recombinant adenovirus. All these antigens were detected in the

107

cell lysates (fig. S1A). Both monomeric RBD and RBD-tr2 were secreted in the

108

culture supernatants (fig. S1B). Particularly, the antigen expression of AdC7-RBD-tr2

109

was much higher than AdC7-S and AdC7-RBD (fig. S1, A and B).

110

To evaluate the immunogenicity of the recombinant AdC7 vaccines, groups of

111

BALB/c mice (n = 5) were immunized on day 0 and 28 with 1 x 1011 vp of AdC7

112

vaccines via intramuscular (i.m.) injection (Fig. 1B). AdC7 without any transgene

113

(AdC7-empty) was injected as the sham control. Blood samples were collected on day

114

21 and 42 (Fig. 1B). The serological RBD-binding IgG and IgA titers was measured.

115

RBD-specific IgG were robustly induced by AdC7-S, AdC7-RBD and AdC7-RBD-tr2

116

(Fig. 1C), while RBD-specific IgA antibodies were only moderately induced in the

117

mice vaccinated with AdC7-RBD-tr2 (fig. S2A). As neutralizing antibodies play a

118

crucial role in protection, pseudovirus displaying the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was used

119

to detect the neutralizating antibody titers in the sera of immunized mice. We found

120

90% neutralization titer (NT90) of the mice sera were increased post boost vaccination

121

for each AdC7 vaccine (Fig.1D). Two doses of AdC7-S, AdC7-RBD and

122

AdC7-RBD-tr2 elicited average NT90 titers of 52, 72 and 416, respectively (Fig. 1D).

123

AdC7-RBD-tr2 showed significantly higher neutralizing titers compared to the other

124

constructs (Fig. 1D).

125

SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted through respiratory droplets and caused lung damage

126

diseases. Specific immune response in the air-way and lung would confer protection

127

against SARS-CoV-2 infection in situ. Immunized mice were euthanized for

128

bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) collection. RBD-binding IgG, IgA and

129

pseudovirus NT90 were measured for the BALF. As expected, a small amount of

130

RBD-binding IgG was detected in these AdC7 vaccines without significant difference

131

compared with sham vaccine (Fig. 1E). Neither RBD-binding IgA nor neutralizing

132

antibodies can be detected in the BALF of mice immunized with AdC7-S, AdC7-RBD

133

or AdC7-RBD-tr2 (Fig. 1, F and G). In order to compare the quality of antibody, the

134

serological neutralizing : binding ratio were calculated for these three constructs. The

135

results showed AdC7-RBD-tr2 elicited highest neutralizing : binding ratio, suggesting

136

its advantage of immunofocusing that potentially reduced ADE risk (Fig. 1H and

137

S3A).

138

As low levels of RBD-binding and neutralizing antibodies were detected in the

139

BALF of mice immunized with each of the AdC7 vaccines via the i.m. route, we

140

sought to immunize BALB/c mice (n = 6) intranasally (i.n.) to strengthen mucosal

141

immunity. On day 0 and 28, the BALB/c mice were vaccinated with 1 x 1011 vp of

142

AdC7 via the i.n. route. On day 21 and 42, serum samples were collected for antibody

143

titration (Fig. 1B). AdC7-S, AdC7-RBD and AdC7-RBD-tr2 all elicited substantial

144

RBD-binding IgG and IgA (Fig. 1I and fig. S2B). Two-dose immunizations of

145

AdC7-S, AdC7-RBD and AdC7-RBD-tr2 induced the pseudovirus NT90 titers of 210,

146

207 and 347, respectively (Fig 1J). The BALF of mice were also collected at day 42

147

for further evaluation. High levels of both RBD-binding IgG and IgA were detected in

148

the BALF of the mice immunized with AdC7-S, AdC7-RBD or AdC7-RBD-tr2 (Fig.

149

1, K and L). The average endpoint titers of RBD-binding IgG and IgA of

150

AdC7-RBD-tr2 group were 1800 and 1620, respectively, with both values higher than

151

the other two constructs (Fig. 1, K and L). Moreover, pseudovirus NT90 of the BALF

152

were assessed, with an average of 10, 15, 17 and 58 for sham, AdC7-S, AdC7-RBD

153

and AdC7-RBD-tr2, respectively (Fig 1M). AdC7-RBD-tr2 group showed higher

154

mucosal pseudovirus NT90 compared to either AdC7-S or AdC7 RBD. In addition, we

155

analyzed the antibody quality in mice sera, and demonstrated RBD and

156

RBD-tr2-based vaccines exhibited higher neutralizing : binding ratio than fell-length

157

S-based vaccine (Fig 1N and S3B). In summary, both systemic and mucosal immunity

158

were induced by recombinant vaccines through i.n. vaccination. Besides,

159

AdC7-RBD-tr2 showed the advantage of immunofocusing to induce neutralizing

160

antibodies blocking receptor-binding.

161

Aside from humoral immunity, cellular immunity also play an important role in

162

protection against the SARS-CoV-2 (72-76). To characterize the cellular immune

163

responses induced by the AdC7 vaccines, the same cohort of immunized BALB/c

164

mice were euthanized on day 42 (Fig. 1B). Splenic lymphocytes were harvested and

165

stimulated with an overlapping 11-mer peptide pool spanning the SARS-CoV-2 S

166

protein and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) and intracellular

167

cytokine staining (ICS) assays. IFN-γ ELISpot analysis showed the induction of

168

robust T cell responses for mice vaccinated with AdC7-S, AdC7-RBD or

169

AdC7-RBD-tr2 via both i.m. and i.n. routes (Fig. 2, A and B). Additionally, the flow

170

cytometric analyses showed that all these recombinant AdC7 vaccines induced robust

171

induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), detected as IFNγ and IL-2 production,

172

via both i.m. and i.n. routes. AdC7-RBD-tr2 performed the best (Fig. 2C and 2E).

173

Besides, the CD4+ T cell responses cytokines were moderately induced for all these

174

three constructs (Fig.2D and 2F). In contrast, no substantial Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and

175

IL10) production was detected for all these three constructs (Fig.2D and 2F). These

176

results demonstrated Th1-biased immune responses were induced in mice received

177

AdC7-S, AdC7-RBD or AdC7-RBD-tr2 vaccines by both i.m. and i.n. routes.

178

Given the fact that AdC7-RBD-tr2 elicited the most robust RBD-binding IgG, IgA,

179

neutralizing antibodies and CTLs, AdC7-RBD-tr2 vaccine was chosen for the further

180

protection efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Since wild type BALB/c mice are

181

not sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the low binding affinity between mouse

182

ACE2 and S protein, we transduced the recombinant Ad5 expressing human ACE2

183

(Ad5-hACE2) into BALB/c mouse lung via i.n. route to rapidly generate a mouse

184

model (77). Five days later, the vaccinated mice were challenged with 5 x 105 TCID50

185

SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3A). AdC7-RBD-tr2 inoculation via i.n. route induced BALB/c

186

mice producing substantial titers of RBD-binding IgG, IgA (Fig. 3, B and C) and

187

pseudovirus neutralizing antibody (Fig. 3D). Additionally, live virus neutralizing

188

assay revealed a mean titer of 120 (one-dose) and 154 (two-dose), respectively, upon

189

AdC7-RBD-tr2 vaccination (Fig. 3E). Three days post challenge, lungs of mice were

190

harvested for virus titration and pathologic analysis. High levels of viral RNA were

191

observed with a mean titer of 9.83 log10 RNA copies/g in mice lung in the one dose

192

sham group (Fig. 3F). Whereas low level of viral RNA was observed in the

193

AdC7-RBD-tr2-vaccinated mice with a mean titer of 6.00 log10 RNA copies/g (Fig.

194

3F). In the prime-boost groups of mice, the mean titer of viral RNA (log10) in mice

195

lung per gram was 9.47 and 5.46 for Sham and AdC7-RBD-tr2, respectively (Fig. 3F).

196

Because a fraction of viral RNA in the lung were probably originated from input

197

challenge virus, levels of subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) were also measured to quantify

198

the live virus. The sgRNA were generated in the infected cells during virus replication

199

but were absent in the virions (78). As a result, high levels of sgRNA were observed

200

with a mean titer of 8.87 and 8.90 log10 RNA copies/g in sham group with the

201

one-dose and two-dose regimens, respectively. Encouragingly, viral sgRNA could not

202

be detected in any lung samples from both one or two doses of AdC7-RBD-tr2

203

vaccinated mice (Fig 3G), indicating the complete protection efficacy of

204

AdC7-RBD-tr2 vaccine.

205

In order to further evaluate vaccine protection against lung damage by

206

SARS-CoV-2, histopathological analysis was performed. The results exhibited mice

207

from sham group developed apparent viral pneumonia characterized by thickened

208

alveolar walls, vascular congestion and inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration (Fig. 4, A, B, I

209

and J), whereas a marked attenuation of pathological damage and inﬂammatory

210

response were seen in the lung tissues of mice vaccinated with AdC7-RBD-tr2 (Fig. 4,

211

C, D, K and L). More importantly, immunofluorescence analysis of lung section

212

stained with anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP antibody revealed the virus presence in the lung of

213

sham group (Fig. 4, E, F, M and N), but not in that of AdC7-RBD-tr2 group (Fig. 4, G,

214

H, O and P). In summary, these results demonstrated the AdC7-RBD-tr2 vaccine

215

robustly elicited mice immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and confer nearly

216

sterilizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

217
218

Discussion

219

Major safety concerns for the vaccine include the vaccine-associated enhanced

220

respiratory disease (ERD), which is associated with unbalanced Th2-biased T cell

221

responses, characterized by enhanced inflammation and immunopathology, and ADE,

222

which is caused by virus uptake into lymphocyte expressing Fc receptor, resulting in

223

increased viral replication and antibody Fc-mediated effector functions (79-81). ADE

224

has been reported for SARS, MERS and other human respiratory virus infections

225

including RSV and measles, which raises a potential concern for the risk of

226

vaccine-enhanced COVID-19 severity (82-86). Although no convincing evidence

227

demonstrated a role for ADE in human COVID-19 pathology, the risk from vaccine

228

immunization should be closely pay attention during vaccine designation (59).

229

Non-neutralizing antibodies or antibodies at sub-neutralizing concentrations bind to

230

viral antigens without blocking or clearing infection was thought to be a major reason

231

for ADE. Up to now, all reported adenovirus vector vaccines against COVID-19 were

232

designed to express full length S protein or modified S protein(19, 20, 24, 32, 87).

233

Specific antibody could be elicited targeting the non-neutralization epitopes on S

234

protein with binding activity. In order to decrease the potential risk of ADE, we

235

constructed a recombinant AdC7 vaccine expressing RBD-tr2 protein and

236

demonstrated it induced robust humoral responses with high antibody quality and

237

Th1-biased T cell responses. In addition, mucosal immunity could also be effectively

238

activated through i.n. immunization, characterized by amounts of RBD-binding IgA

239

and neutralization antibody detected in BALF. Compared with the full-length S

240

construct, RBD-tr2 antigen may induce less non-neutralizing antibodies and enhance

241

antibody quality. The overall immunity elicited by AdC7-RBD-tr2 vaccine confer

242

mice complete protection against COVID-19 without infection enhancement or

243

immunopathological exacerbation. Collectively, these results suggest AdC7-RBD-tr2

244

is a promising candidate vaccine to move forward for preclinical and clinical trials for

245

prophylaxis of COVID-19.

314

peptide (MIHSVFLLMFLLTPTES) and amino acids 16 to 1273 of the S protein of

315

SARS-CoV-2. The RBD construct contains the same signal peptide and amino acids

316

319 to 537 of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The RBD-tr2 construct contains the same

317

signal peptide and two RBD (amino acids 319 to 537 of the S protein) connected as

318

tandem repeat without any linker sequence. The cassette of full-length S, RBD and

319

RBD-tr2 were cloned into pAdC7, forming recombinant adenovirus genome,

320

respectively. These recombinant adenovirus genomes were linearized and transfected

321

into HEK293 cells to rescue the recombinant adenovirus, which was further

322

propagated and puriﬁed by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation as

323

344

ﬁltration chromatography with HiLoad® 16/600 Superdex® 200 pg (GE Healthcare)

345

in a buffer composed of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl.

346

Immunization

347

AdC7-S, AdC7-RBD and AdC7-RBD-tr2 was diluted in PBS. Empty vector AdC7

348

(AdC7-empty) was used as a sham control. Female BALB/c mice at 6 to 8 weeks of

349

age were immunized with 1 x 1011 vp of vaccine or sham control through the i.m. or

350

i.n. route. The second dose was as same as the first dose and given 28 days post prime

351

vaccination. The sera were collected as indicated in ﬁgures legends.

352

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

353

Binding properties of murine sera to monomer RBD or S protein were determined

354

by ELISA. 96-well plates (3590; Corning, USA) were coated over-night with 3 μg/ml

355

of monomer

356

carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, and blocked in 5% skim milk in PBS. Serum or

357

BALF samples were serially diluted and added to each well. Plates were incubated

358

with goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody or goat anti-mouse IgA-HRP antibody and

359

subsequently developed with 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate.

360

Reactions were stopped with 2 M hydrochloric acid, and the absorbance was

361

measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (PerkinElmer, USA). The endpoint

362

titers were deﬁned as the highest reciprocal dilution of serum to give an absorbance

363

greater than 2.5-fold of the background values. Antibody titer below the limit of

364

detection was determined as half the limit of detection.

371

monolayers in 96-well plates. After incubation for 24 hours, the cells were lysed and

372

luciferase activity was measured by the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, USA)

373

according to the manufacturer’s protocol. NT90 was deﬁned as the highest reciprocal

374

serum dilution at which the relative light units (RLUs) were reduced by greater than

375

90% compared with virus control wells. NT90 below the limit of detection was

376

determined as half the limit of detection.

377

Live SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay

378

The neutralizing activity of mouse serum was assessed using a previously described

379

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay (13). Brieﬂy, sera from immunized mice were

380

4-fold serially diluted and mixed with the same volume of SARS-CoV-2 (100 TCID50),

381

incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Thereafter, 100 μL virus-serum mixture was transferred

382

to pre-plated VERO-E6 cells in 96-well plates. Inoculated plates were incubated at

383

37°C for an additional 72 hours, following which the cytopathic effect was observed

384

microscopically. The neutralization titers were deﬁned as the reciprocal of serum

385

dilution required for 50% neutralization of viral infection. All the live virus

386

neutralization assay was conducted under biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility in IMCAS.

387

ELISpot assay.

388

To detect antigen-speciﬁc T lymphocyte responses, an IFNγ-based ELISpot assay

389

was performed as previously described (88), with some modifications. Brieﬂy, an S

390

peptide pool consisting of 15-18-mers (overlapping by 11 amino acids) and spanning

391

the entire S protein of SARS-CoV-2 were synthesized. Spleens of vaccinated BALB/c

392

mice were harvested at 2 weeks post the second dose immunization and plenocytes

393

were isolated. Flat-bottom, 96-well plates were precoated with 10 μg/ml anti-mouse

394

IFNγ Ab (BD Biosciences, USA) overnight at 4°C and then blocked for 2 hours at

395

37°C. Mouse splenocytes were added to the plate. Then, the peptide pool (2 μg /ml

396

individual peptide) was added to the wells. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was added as

397

a positive control. Cells incubated without stimulation were employed as a negative

398

control. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were removed, and the plates were

399

processed in turn with biotinylated IFNγ detection antibody, streptavidin-HRP

401

observed, the development was stopped by thoroughly rinsing samples with deionized

402

water. The numbers of the spots were determined using an automatic ELISpot reader

403

and image analysis software (Cellular Technology Ltd.).

404

ICS and ﬂow cytometry

405

ICS assays were performed as previously described (90), with some modifications.

406

Brieﬂy, mouse splenocytes were added to the plate (2 x 106/well) and then stimulated

407

with the peptide pool (2 μg /ml for individual peptide) for 5 h. The cells were

408

incubated with GolgiStop (BD Biosciences, USA) for an additional 6 h at 37°C. Then,

409

the cells were harvested and stained with anti-CD3 (BioLegend), anti-CD4

410

(BioLegend) and anti-CD8α (BioLegend) surface markers. The cells were

411

subsequently ﬁxed and permeabilized in permeabilizing buffer (BD Biosciences, USA)

412

and stained with anti-mouse anti-IFNγ (BioLegend), anti-TNFα (BioLegend),

413

anti-IL-2 (BioLegend), anti-IL-4 (BioLegend) and anti-IL-10 (BioLegend) antibodies.

414

All ﬂuorescent lymphocytes were gated on a FACSAria ﬂow cytometer (BD

415

Biosciences, USA).

416

Animal protection against virus challenge

417

To evaluate the protection efficacy of vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2, a

418

recombinant adenovirus Ad5-hACE2 transducing BALB/c mice model was used.

419

Immunized BALB/c mice were i.n infected with 8 x 108 vp of Ad5-hACE2. Five days

420

later, the transduced mice were challenged with 5 x 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 via

421

the i.n. route. Three days post challenge, mice were euthanized and necropsied. Lung

422

tissues were collected and split into two parts for virus titration and pathological

423

examination. All animal experiments with SARS-CoV-2 challenge were conducted

424

under animal biosafety level 3 (ABSL3) facility in IMCAS.

425

qRT-PCR

426

Mice lung tissues were weighed and homogenized. Virus RNA was isolated from

427

50-μl supernatants of homogenized tissues using a nucleic acid extraction instrument

429

SARS-CoV-2-speciﬁc quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays were

430

performed using a FastKing One Step Probe RT-qPCR kit (Tiangen Biotech, China)

431

on a CFX96 Touch real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, USA) according to the

432

manufacturer’s protocol. Two sets of primers and probes were used to detect a region

433

of the N gene of viral genome (90) and a region of E gene of sgRNA of SARS-CoV-2

434

(91), respectively, with sequences as follows:

435

440

sgRNA-E-R, ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA;

441

sgRNA-E-probe, FAM-ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG-TAMRA.

442

Viral loads were expressed on a log10 scale as viral copies/gram after calculation

443

with a standard curve. Viral copy numbers below the limit of detection were set as

444

half the limit of detection.

445

Histopathology analysis

446

Mice lung tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, embedded in

447

parafﬁn, and then sectioned. Tissue sections (4 μm) were deparafﬁnized in xylene and

448

stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for pathological examination, such as

449

peribronchiolitis, interstitial pneumonitis and alveolitis. Besides, tissue sections were

450

stained with anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein antibody (Sino Biological, China) to

451

detect virus infection.

452

Data analysis

453

Data are expressed as the means ± standard errors of the means (SEM). For all

454
