Abstract
Precision epidemiology using genomic technologies allows for a more targeted approach to
COVID-19 control and treatment at individual and population level, and is the urgent need of the
day. It enables identification of patients who may be at higher risk than others to COVID-19related mortality, due to their genetic architecture, or who might respond better to a COVID-19
treatment. The COVID-19 virus, similar to SARS-CoV, uses the ACE2 receptor for cell entry
and employs the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for viral S protein priming. This study
aspires to present a multi-omics view of how variations in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes affect
COVID-19 infection and disease progression in affected individuals. It reports, for both genes,
several variant and gene expression analysis findings, through (i) comparison analysis over
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), that may account for the difference of COVID-19
manifestations among global sub-populations; (ii) calculating prevalence of structural variations
(copy number variations (CNVs) / insertions), amongst populations; and (iii) studying expression
patterns stratified by gender and age, over all human tissues. This work is a good first step to be
followed by additional studies and functional assays towards informed treatment decisions and
improved control of the infection rate.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus of 2019 has been the cause of a global health emergency, declared as a
world-wide pandemic of COVID-19, with symptoms including fever, severe respiratory illness,
and pneumonia

1

leading to multiple organ failure and eventual sepsis 2, followed by death in

severe cases. Studies have indicated the similarity of COVID-19 to the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)

3,4

; however the major challenge with COVID-19 is its

comparatively higher human-to-human transmission rate 5,6. The COVID-19 virus belongs to the
beta-coronavirus genus, which also includes the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 7. Monumental efforts are underway to find
drugs and vaccines that could potentially be used to treat people with COVID-19 as well as help
prevent infection. Prior studies have revealed that the COVID-19 virus, similar to SARS-CoV,
uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for cell entry 8. The SARS-CoV S
protein (SARS-S) engages ACE2 as the entry receptor 9 and employs the cellular serine protease
TMPRSS2 for S protein priming 10. The efficiency of ACE2 was found to be a key determinant
of SARS-CoV transmissibility

11,12

. SARS-S and SARS-2-S (from COVID-19) share

∼76%

amino acid identity 9, and therefore a confirmation that SARS-2-S, like SARS-S, employs ACE2
and TMPRSS2 for host cell entry and disease progression, would provide the scientific
community with relevant information regarding treatment of infected people and controlling the
infection rate.
Precision epidemiology constitutes an increase in both scale and resolution of inference of
genomic technologies that take a targeted approach towards infectious disease control

13

. It

includes genome-based approaches for providing information on molecular diagnosis and
individual-level treatment regimens. To this end, pharmacogenetics studies involving multi3

omics evidence could be a strategy to control the uncertainty of treatment decisions for severely
ill COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 has a wide range of presentation, with some patients dying 14
while others are asymptomatic

15

. Other than the clear risks that are associated with age and

comorbidities (due to preexisting chronic conditions such as cardiac diseases, diabetes, or cancer)
16-18

, such variability in the manifestation of symptoms and in outcomes needs to be explained

through genetic probing, as drug development guided by genetic evidence should have greater
rates of success

19,20

. Identifying patients who may be at a higher risk of COVID-19-related

mortality, due to their genetic architecture, or patients who might respond particularly well to a
particular drug, could lead to help guide treatment decisions and successfully treat the symptoms.
It could also help explain why otherwise healthy individuals in low-risk groups sometimes
experience severe disease symptoms. It is necessary to identify variants of the ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 genes that confer higher susceptibility to fatality and symptoms. However, there is the
possibility that a susceptibility gene is likely to have low penetrance, and thus not all carriers will
develop the disorder. Specific environmental influences are also more likely to be important risk
factors that could have an effect on the severity of transmission and infections. Therefore, we
will present multiple lines of supporting evidence from multi-omics data such as single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), allele frequency information, structural variations such as
copy number variations (CNVs i.e. deletions, duplications) and, insertions, and gene expression
information for individual genes, to illustrate how multi-omics approaches can help identify
COVID-19 risk factors.
Early COVID-19 data is alarming, when observed from the racial point of view. The
death/recovery ratio, which is defined as the number of deaths caused by the virus divided by the
number of people that were infected by it and recovered, is highly variable across ethnicities.

While COVID-19 infection was observed in individuals from South and East Asian countries as
early as end-of-2019 or beginning-of-2020, the recovery rates have been relatively quicker with
lower morbidities, than that of Western countries such as the USA and the UK, where people
appear to remain affected for longer with slower recovery times and exhibit higher
death/recovery ratios

21

. The global death toll from the coronavirus climbed to 372,116 as of

June 1st, 2020, while the number of cases surpassed 6.17 million, according to a running tally by
US-based Johns Hopkins University (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). However, the 10
ASEAN countries (https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/coronavirus-asia-asean-live-updatesby-country/) reported around 91,180 cases so far, with the total number of fatalities standing at
2,773. Others including Taiwan (441 confirmed cases and 7 deaths) and South Korea (11,344
confirmed cases and 269 deaths) also display very low death/recovery ratios. Densely populated
developing countries in South Asia and parts of Africa have also been observed to fare far better
when it comes to the mortality rate of COVID-19. The case fatality ratio (CFR) in South Asian
countries such as India is 3.3%, Pakistan 2.2%, Bangladesh 1.5% and Sri Lanka 1%. Moreover,
as of early April 2020, 72% of people who died of COVID-19 in Chicago, USA, were black
(one-third of the city’s population), while in Georgia, as of 17 April, 40% of COVID-19
cases were white people (58% of the state) (https://dph.georgia.gov/covid-19-daily-status-report).
In the UK, of the first 2,249 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 35% were non-white, which is
a lot higher than the proportion of non-white people in England and Wales – 14%, according to
the most recent census (http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_290685.pdf). All of this data
suggests a likely population level genetic variation in terms of susceptibility to the coronavirus
and COVID-19 manifestations. Therefore, distribution of any genetic risk factors between
populations could be the underlying mechanism leading to population-specific risk levels.

Methods

Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Analysis
Prior studies have suggested that genetic variants in ACE2 might affect ACE2 levels in the
human body

22,23

. Several computational variant annotation tools are available that provide

integrated reports that can be used for further rule-based filtering. VariED is one such online
database developed by our research group, the first among its peers, to provide an integrated
database of gene annotation and expression profiles for variants related to human diseases

24

.

VariED was utilized to obtain allele frequencies for all SNP variants from both ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 for different global sub-populations, American (AMR), African (AFR), Finnish (FIN),
Non-Finnish Europeans (NFE), South-Asian (SAS), East-Asian (EAS) and other populations
(OTH). Variant and allele frequency data infers gene and variant function (e.g., whether a gene is
essential) and is helpful in population genetics analyses. Although these data are collected from
healthy people, such an analysis would help us screen potential targets for further functional
assays or cohort studies. We therefore conducted a two-step variant allele comparison analysis
over all SNPs from both genes, to obtain significant variants contributing to the difference
among all populations, using Fisher’s exact test. First a general Fisher’s exact test with a Monte
Carlo approximation was applied to all SNPs from both genes, over all populations, followed by
a post-hoc analysis, that was conducted over the selected SNPs from the first step, to pinpoint
populations that contribute the most to the variation in allele frequency through a 2X2 Fisher’s
exact test. A cut-off of P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

Structural variation analysis
Knowledge of genetic structural variations in humans has accrued slowly, and studies have
revealed that structural variation contributes to all classes of disease with a genetic etiology,
including infectious diseases25. Due to the availability of CNV data in large population samples,
CNVs have been the focus of studies investigating the functional consequences of structural
variation. CNVs are an important and large source of both normal and pathogenic variation, and
the major challenge associated with CNVs is the estimation of whether the variation is benign or
affects a vital biological function and results in disease. To identify causative CNVs, the first
step is to check the presence of the CNV in control cohorts and then use classifier programs or
databases to predict the disease potential of the CNV. In this study, we focused on studying the
CNV frequencies of our candidate genes in control cohorts and accordingly, we utilized
CNVIntegrate 26, a web-based system developed by our research group, which is an integrated,
sorted, and structured database built using CNV datasets from multiple sources, to query the
genes of interest. CNV information from (i) ExAC, which consists of healthy individuals from
global sub-populations, and (ii) TWCNV, a CNV database constructed from healthy Taiwanese
individuals, was used to identify the prevalence of structural variations (CNVs or insertions) in
genes ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Thereby, we calculated the duplications and deletions frequencies
for both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 among the healthy population in the TWCNV and ExAC
databases. We corroborated the results from CNVIntegrate with the structural variation query
results for both the genes in the GnomAD browser 27.

ACE2 has been observed to be expressed predominantly by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine,
kidney and blood vessels
human tissues

28

. TMPRSS2 has been reported previously to be expressed in normal

29

, in small intestine, prostate, colon, stomach, and salivary glands. We used a

gene expression database/web tool, CellExpress 30, developed by our research group, to study the
gene expression patterns over all tissues for both ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Some studies have shown
that in addition to cardiac and diabetic conditions, cancer

31

is associated with a high rate of

comorbidity for COVID-19; 20% of the cases ending in death in Italy had a medical history of
malignancy in the previous 5 years, and in Wuhan, patients (>60 years of age) with non-small
cell lung cancer had the highest incidence rate for COVID-19, followed by esophageal and breast
cancer 31. The report also showed that these patients were more likely to suffer life-threatening
complications requiring emergency ICU admission or mechanical ventilation, with death
attributed to acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, and
pulmonary embolism. Therefore, we conducted a case control analysis for both ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 using CellExpress, with the case data for 36 cancer types acquired from GSE36133
(Cancer Cell line Encyclopedia) 32, and the control data from the Roth normal dataset (GSE7307).
We also did a gene expression search for both genes over all tissues in cancer datasets, stratified
by gender and age, using CellExpress.

Results

SNP analysis results
After filtering out the uninformative SNPs with no reported allele frequencies, a total of 362
SNPs from ACE2 and 532 SNPs from TMPRSS2 were used to compare the allele frequencies

among different sub-populations from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) Database 33.
In the first step, 44 significant SNPs from ACE2 and 98 SNPs from TMPRSS2 were obtained
from the Fisher’s exact test with a Monte Carlo approximation, that were found to display
different allele frequencies between sub-populations. Then a 2X2 Fisher’s exact test on selected
SNPs from the first step to identify populations that contribute the most to the variation in allele
frequency. Table 1 and Table 2 display selected SNPs with significant allele frequency variation.
The reported SNPs were found to have higher allele frequencies among Africans and East Asian
populations compared to Europeans and Americans. Africans were found to display particularly
significant variation for most of the reported SNPs from both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which may
suggest differential susceptibility towards coronavirus in the respective populations under similar
conditions. Most of the reported SNPs in this study have also been reported in other COVID-19related studies

34-39

. Supplementary file 1 and Supplementary file 2 give a full list of all the

significant findings.

Structural Variation analysis results
The duplication and deletion frequencies for the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes were obtained from
the control populations in Taiwan (TWCNV) and other global ethnic populations (ExAC) using
CNVIntegrate. An intuitive model suggests that an increase in the copy number of a specific
gene will, on average, lead to corresponding increase in the expression level of that gene, and
vice versa 40. The results were consistent with this hypothesis. No duplications or deletions were
observed for ACE2 among the healthy population in the TWCNV and ExAC databases (Figure
1A). For TMPRSS2, duplication was observed in 0.06% and 0.014% of the samples from
TWCNV and ExAC, respectively, while deletion was observed at 1.08% in TWCNV and 0.0%

in ExAC (Figure 1B). The corroborated results from GnomAD browser with the structural
variation query results for both the genes are displayed in Table 3. ACE2 displayed only one
duplication event, and TMPRSS2 displayed 4 duplication/insertion and deletion events (Table 3).
This suggests that these variations are rare among healthy cohorts and provide an evidence of the
possibility that they could be potentially pathogenic. Moreover, whether the CNV is of clinical
consequence may also depend on other factors, such as ethnic background (with specific genetic
makeup), environmental elements (such as social distancing measures), age, or sex 41. Perception
of the clinical consequences can change over time, as our knowledge grows. Moreover, the
consideration of x-linked CNVs (ACE2 is located at chrX:15579156-15620271) in males is
important, as many of the reported benign variants included in databases are seen in females.
However, in men, who have only one X chromosome, the same change may be fundamentally
pathogenic. This might also be an explanation of why more deaths from COVID-19 are observed
in males than females 42.

Gene Expression Analysis results
Figure 2 displays the gene expression of baseline healthy populations from CellExpress,
stratified by gender, to observe its effect (if any) on the baseline gene expression levels. Other
than the pituitary gland, the baseline data did not show any significant difference in gene
expression levels between males and females. Similarly, no effect was observed when gene
expression was stratified by age (Figure 3). The overall results resonated with prior findings, as
both the genes are found to be expressed consistently in all tissues, which was further validated
by tissue-specific gene expression in the GTEx population

comorbidity for cancer patients were higher, a case control analysis for both ACE2 and

TMPRSS2 using CellExpress was conducted which demonstrated ACE2 expression to be
significantly associated with cancer, with a p-value of 7.66x10-4, while TMPRSS2 expression
displayed a p-value of 7.83x10-2. The results for a gene expression search for both genes over all
tissues in cancer datasets, stratified by gender and age, using CellExpress, displayed high gene
expression in all tissues for both genes, with no effect of gender and age (Supplementary file 4,
Supplementary file 5).

Discussion
Incorporating informative priors based on biological knowledge or predicted variant function,
along with integrated gene expression or other omics data, may help to inform treatment
decisions for coronavirus-infected people showing COVID-19 symptoms and control the
infection rate. This work provides a basis for future investigations of ACE2 and TMPRSS2
through further functional assays and protein expression analysis. More information on variants
(SNPS and CNVs) needs to be accumulated through (1) fine mapping analysis of the variants
that have been obtained through initial analysis in this study, in order to confirm their
contribution to the differential responses to COVID-19 and mortality across different ethnicities
in COVID-19 patients; (2) improved risk prediction accuracy through large case-control studies
involving candidate gene studies and gene-gene interaction studies using genome-wide data; and
(3) experimental validation of all significant findings. Gene expression analysis showed lung
tissues to have comparatively higher expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, consistent with the fact
that COVID-19 affects lungs and lung tissues. Further protein expression studies are required to
confirm findings in lung and different tissues. It is necessary to validate mRNA findings at the
protein level, as mRNA expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not necessarily the same

as the protein expression patterns due to some post-translational modification. Furthermore, a
comparison of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels between patients of different ethnicities
also needs to be expanded to account for the various levels of affected cases and morbidity.
Immune responses in infected patients play an important role in fighting coronavirus, even
though immunopathological damage can occur via the cytokine storm. Extensive experimental
analysis is necessary to tease out further correlations between expression of the ACE2 receptor
and immune signatures in the lungs. One conjecture has been about levels of BCG (Bacille
Calmette Guérin) vaccination for tuberculosis, where a striking negative correlation has been
observed with COVID-19 casualties. The primary function of the BCG vaccine involves
boosting immunity, and it might have a role to play in the greater immunity against the SARSCoV-2 virus. According to the BCG world atlas, the UK and western Europe had BCG
vaccination policies in the past, while in the US it is not mandatory for all groups of
people. However, in Asia and eastern Europe, BCG vaccination is mandatory for all groups of
people. In spite of Spain and Portugal sharing a border, the former suffered high infection and
the latter (which has a BCG program) did not. Survival prediction studies, using the BCG index
as the predictor and controlling for other confounding factors such as age, gender, and
environmental effects, could further explain the disparity of COVID-19 deaths between East and
West. Finally, it is important to understand the precise virus-host interaction. Single-cell RNA
sequencing in tissues with higher gene expression could be conducted to understand these
dynamics. To bring the concept of precision epidemiology full circle, all the findings from
bioinformatics analyses need to be further validated by experimental and clinical data.
This study conducts genetic probing with the intention of explaining the variability in symptoms
and diverse outcomes of COVID-19. It provides some significant findings (SNP, CNV and gene

expression) from ACE2 and TMPRSS2, as evidence, for a plausible place to start looking into
them. The work is a good first step to be followed by additional studies and functional assays
that could potentially evaluate the findings to identify patients who may be at a higher risk of
COVID-19-related mortality or infection, towards informed decisions for treatment and cure.

Each cell displays P-values from a post-hoc analysis on selected SNPs from ACE2, to identify populations that contribute (p-value <0.05) a
majority of the variation of allele frequency through a 2X2 Fisher’s exact test. AFR: African/African American (5203 samples); AMR: Latino
(5789); EAS: East Asian (4327); FIN: Finnish (3307); NFE: Non-Finnish European (33370); OTH: Other (454); SAS: South Asian (8256). All
data was downloaded from the ExAC (The Exome Aggregation Consortium) subpopulations using the database VariED
( http://varied.cgm.ntu.edu.tw/Variants_search ).

Tables
Table 1. SNPs from ACE2 with significant allele frequency variation between ethnic
populations
Description: Each cell displays P-values from a post-hoc analysis on selected SNPs from ACE2,
to identify populations that contribute (p-value <0.05) a majority of the variation of allele
frequency through a 2X2 Fisher’s exact test. AFR: African/African American (5203 samples);
AMR: Latino (5789); EAS: East Asian (4327); FIN: Finnish (3307); NFE: Non-Finnish
European (33370); OTH: Other (454); SAS: South Asian (8256). All data was downloaded from
the ExAC (The Exome Aggregation Consortium) subpopulations using the database VariED
( http://varied.cgm.ntu.edu.tw/Variants_search ).
