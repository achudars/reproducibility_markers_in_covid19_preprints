Summary
COVID-19 vaccines are urgently needed and while single-dose vaccines are preferred, two-dose
regimens may improve efficacy. We show improved Ad26.COV2.S immunogenicity in non-human
primates after a second vaccine dose, while both regimens protected aged animals against SARSCoV-2 disease.

Abstract
Safe and effective coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 vaccines are urgently needed to control the
ongoing pandemic. While single-dose vaccine regimens would provide multiple advantages, two
doses may improve the magnitude and durability of immunity and protective efficacy. We
assessed one- and two-dose regimens of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine candidate in adult and aged
non-human primates (NHP). A two-dose Ad26.COV2.S regimen induced higher peak binding and
neutralizing antibody responses compared to a single dose. In one-dose regimens neutralizing
antibody responses were stable for at least 14 weeks, providing an early indication of durability.
Ad26.COV2.S induced humoral immunity and Th1 skewed cellular responses in aged NHP that
were comparable to adult animals. Importantly, aged Ad26.COV2.S-vaccinated animals
challenged 3 months post -dose 1 with a SARS-CoV-2 spike G614 variant showed near complete
lower and substantial upper respiratory tract protection for both regimens. These are the first
NHP data showing COVID-19 vaccine protection against the SARS-CoV-2 spike G614 variant and
support ongoing clinical Ad26.COV2.S development.

Introduction
Development of safe and effective vaccines to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic
(Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020; WHO, 2020) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Wu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) is a global priority. Ideally,
especially in the context of a pandemic, a vaccine provides both an early onset of protection and
durable protection. The durability of vaccine-elicited protection depends on the capacity of the
vaccine platform, specific antigen (design) and vaccination regimen to efficiently stimulate the
immune system (Cohen, 2019; Pulendran & Ahmed, 2011) and on several characteristics linked
to the recipient of the vaccine (Zimmermann and Curtis, 2019). Age for instance plays an
important role, as in the elderly the immune response to vaccines is usually reduced in magnitude
and duration, potentially resulting in reduced vaccine efficacy (Wagner et al., 2018; Crooke et al.,
2019; Gustafson et al., 2020; Weinberger, 2018). Although persons of all ages are at risk of
contracting COVID-19, the risk of developing severe or critical illness increases markedly with age
( Mallapaty, 2020; CDC, 2020), warranting the testing of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in different
age cohorts.
The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine candidate is a non-replicating adenovirus 26 (Ad26)-based vector
encoding the stabilized full length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein based on the Wuhan Hu1 SARS-CoV2 isolate, and containing an aspartic acid (D) residue in amino acidic position 614 (D614) (Bos et
al., 2020). In pre-clinical efficacy studies, a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S, provided robust
protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge (USA-WA1/2020 viral strain, D614) in both upper and
lower airways in rhesus macaques (Mercado et al., 2020) and protected Syrian golden hamsters
from severe clinical disease (Tostanoski et al., 2020). Protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in

NHP in this and other studies, strongly correlated with the presence of virus binding and
neutralizing antibodies in serum (Yu et al., 2020; Mercado et al., 2020; McMahan et al., 2020).
These data corroborate previously reported findings on SARS-CoV, showing that neutralizing
antibody responses against the SARS-CoV spike protein, that binds to the same cellular receptor
as SARS-CoV-2 for cell entry (Shan et al., 2020), were associated with protection against SARSCoV challenge in nonclinical models (Chen et al., 2005).
Interim analyses of a Phase 1/2a study showed that Ad26.COV2.S elicits a prompt and robust
immune response after a single-dose vaccination in both adults (18-55 years old) and elderly (≥65
years old) humans , as measured up to day 29 post-immunization (Sadoff et al., 2021). Based on
these data, the protective efficacy against COVID-19 is currently being evaluated in humans in a
Phase 3 one-dose efficacy trial (ENSEMBLE trial, NCT04505722). A second Phase 3 study
(ENSEMBLE 2, NCT04614948) is currently evaluating vaccine efficacy and durability of two-doses
Ad26.COV2.S regimen as well, as the durability of immunity and efficacy may potentially be
enhanced by a second dose. Indeed, in other programs with Ad26-based vaccines, two doses
induced higher and more durable immune responses (Geisbert et al., 2011; Callendret et al.,
2018; Salisch et al., 2019; Salisch et al., 2021) . Here we report immunogenicity data after oneand two-dose regimens of Ad26.COV2.S in adult NHP, including a group of aged NHP, for a followup period up to 14 weeks after the first vaccination, as well as protective efficacy data in aged
NHP challenged with SARS-CoV-2 carrying a glycine residue in position 614 of the spike protein
(D614G mutation), which emerged as the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 spike variant (G614) in the
global pandemic thus far.

Results
Immunogenicity of one- and two-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine regimes in adult rhesus
macaques
Adult Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta; 57 females and 3 males, 3.3 - 5.0 years old) were
immunized with either a single dose of 1x1011 viral particles( vp) or 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (n=14
per group) or with two doses of 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S with a 4- or 8-week interval (n=14 per
group). A sham control group (n=4) received an injection with saline at week 0 and week 8. SARSCoV-2 spike protein-specific antibody responses were measured every two weeks up to 14 weeks
after the first immunization by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and pseudovirus
neutralization assay (psVNA). Immune responses were detected in all vaccinated animals as early
as two weeks after immunization and significantly increased by week 4 post-immunization
(p≤0.010, ANOVA paired t-test) (Figure 1A and B). Animals that received 1x1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S
had 1.6-fold higher binding- and 2.1-fold higher neutralizing antibody levels (p=0.008 and
p=0.004, respectively, ANOVA t-test) relative to animals immunized with 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S.
Similar differences in response levels were maintained throughout the entire observation period.
However, at week 14, neutralizing antibody titers were similar between the two one- dose groups
(p=0.096, ANOVA paired t-test). Spike protein-specific binding antibody levels declined more
rapidly than neutralizing antibody levels, irrespective of the vaccine dose the animals had
received.
A second vaccine dose given 4 or 8 weeks after the first vaccination elicited a significant increase
in spike protein-specific antibody responses relative to the pre-dose 2 timepoint (p≤0.001,

ANOVA t-test) (Figure 1A and 1B). Compared to the one-dose regimen with 5x1010 vp
Ad26.COV2.S, a second immunization given at 4 or 8 weeks post first dose, elicited a 5.7- and
11.8-fold increase (p<0.001, ANOVA t-test) in binding antibody concentrations, and a 7.6- and
15.2-fold increase (p<0.001, ANOVA t-test) in neutralizing antibody titers, respectively, as
measured 2 weeks post-dose 2. Similar differences were observed when comparing the antibody
responses elicited by the two-dose 5x1010 vp vaccine regimens, to those elicited by the one-dose
1 x 1011 vp vaccine dose.
While the two-dose vaccine regimens with 4- and 8-week interval elicited comparable spike
protein-specific binding antibody concentrations two weeks post second immunization (p=0.456,
ANOVA t-test) (Figure 1A), the geometric mean of neutralizing antibody titers was 2.2-fold higher
for the 8-week compared to the 4-week regimen (p=0.005, ANOVA with t-test) (Figure 1 B). At
week 4 and week 6 post second immunization, binding and neutralizing antibody levels declined
in both two-dose groups with similar kinetics, maintaining the relative difference in neutralizing
antibody titers (2.1- and 2.4-fold higher for the 8-week regimen at 4-and 6- weeks respectively ,
p=0.021 and p=0.001, respectively, ANOVA t-test).
In spite of the more rapid decline of binding antibody concentrations relative to neutralizing
antibody titers in animals that received a one-dose regimen, we observed good overall
correlation between binding and neutralizing antibody levels across timepoints for all tested
regimens (R =0.7875, p<0.001, Spearman rank-correlation test) (Figure 1C).

Immunogenicity of one- and two-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine regimens in aged rhesus
macaques.
As COVID-19 severity and mortality increases with age, we additionally analyzed the
immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in aged Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta; 20 females, 13.75
- 21.9 years old). An aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3) adjuvanted soluble trimeric spike protein
stabilized in its prefusion conformation was included as a T helper 2 (Th2) skewing control vaccine
for immunological assessment only. Groups were immunized with a one-dose regimen of 1x1011
vp Ad26.COV2.S (n=6), a two-dose regimen of 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S (n=6) or a two-dose
regimen of Al(OH)3-adjuvanted 100 µg spike protein (n=4), 8 weeks apart. A sham control group
received an Ad26 vector encoding an irrelevant antigen (Ad26.RSV.gLuc; sham control; n=4) at
week 0 and week 8. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific binding and neutralizing antibody levels
were measured every two weeks up to 10 weeks post the first immunization and spike proteinspecific cellular responses were measured at 4 and 10 weeks.
Spike protein-specific binding antibody concentrations significantly increased for each
vaccination regimen from week 2 onwards (p≤0.034, ANOVA paired t-test comparing week 0
versus week 2). At weeks 6 and 8 the Ad26.COV2.S induced antibody concentrations were
significantly increased compared to Al(OH)3-adjuvanted spike protein induced concentrations
(p≤0.036, ANOVA t-test). No statistically significant differences in antibody responses elicited by
the two regimens employing different Ad26.COV2.S dose levels could be detected up to week 8.

At week 10, two weeks after the second dose, the groups that received a second dose of 5x1010
vp Ad26.COV2.S or Al(OH)3-adjuvanted spike protein had significantly higher antibody
concentrations compared to recipients of the single dose 1x1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S (4.4-fold and
5.9 fold for the 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S group and Al(OH)3-adjuvanted spike protein group
respectively, p≤0.002, ANOVA t-test). Spike-specific antibody concentrations between the two
dose regimens were not significantly different (p=0.482) (Figure 2A).
Kinetics of neutralizing antibody responses were determined by a wildtype Virus Neutralization
Assay (wtVNA). A single dose of 1x1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S induced neutralizing antibody titers at
week 2 which were significantly increased at week 4 in all animals compared to the previous
timepoint (p=0.031, sign test), and remained stable thereafter up to week 10. Similarly, the twodose 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S regimen induced neutralizing antibody titers that significantly
increased at week 4 (p=0.031, sign test) and 6 (p=0.008, Tobit ANOVA z-test) compared to
previous time points. At week 10, 2 weeks after the second dose, antibody titers were increased
8-fold compared to week 8 (p<0.001, Tobit ANOVA z-test). Al(OH)3-adjuvanted spike protein
induced only low and transient levels of neutralizing antibodies after the first dose in 2 out of 4
animals only. At week 10 however, 2 weeks after the second dose, all 4 animals had neutralizing
antibody titers in the same range as the Ad26.COV2.S groups (no statistical analysis possible due
to small group size of the adjuvanted protein group). Pairwise comparison of vaccine groups at
week 10 showed that the two-dose 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S regimen or Al(OH)3-adjuvanted spike
protein induced significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers compared to the single-dose
1x1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S group (10- and 5.5-fold for 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S and Al(OH)3adjuvanted spike protein group, respectively, p≤0.004, Tobit ANOVA z-test). Neutralizing

antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 isolate Leiden-0008, which contains the D614G spike
protein mutation (Plante et al., 2020), were not significantly different (p=0.303, Tobit ANOVA ztest) between the two-dose regimens at week 10 (Figure 2B). The spike protein-specific
neutralizing antibody titers strongly correlated with binding antibody concentrations (R=0.92,
p=<0.001, Spearman rank correlation), showing a higher sensitivity of the ELISA (Figure 2C). There
was also a strong correlation observed between neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2
isolate Leiden-0008 and the Victoria/1/2020 (D614 variant) in an additional neutralization assay
(R=0.89, p=<0.001, Spearman rank correlation; Supplementary figure 1).

Spike protein-specific T cell responses were measured with enzyme-linked immunospot assay
(ELISpot) and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) using peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) stimulated with 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids and spanning the
complete SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Both Ad26.COV2.S regimens as well as Al(OH)3-adjuvanted
spike protein induced interferon gamma (IFN-) responses as measured by ELISpot at 4 weeks
after the first dose. At week 10, IFN- responses were lower for the 1x1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S and
adjuvanted spike protein groups compared to week 4. In animals vaccinated with the two-dose
5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S regimen IFN- responses at week 10 were comparable to week 4 ,
suggesting that a second dose of Ad26.COV2.S maintains spike-specific T cell responses.
Substantial IL-4 responses were observed only for the Al(OH)3-adjuvanted spike protein group at
both week 4 and week 10 by ELISpot (Figure 3A).
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell cytokine responses were also analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining
(ICS). Ad26.COV2.S induced a CD4+ Th1-biased response with minimal expression of Th2

cytokines, while Al(OH)3-adjuvanted spike protein induced a more dominant Th2 response
(Figure 3B and Supplementary figure 2). Spike protein-specific CD8+ T cells induced by
Ad26.COV2.S mainly produced IFN- and IL-2, while CD8+ T cells induced by Al(OH)3-adjuvanted
spike protein only produced IL-2. None of the immunization regimens induced CD8+ T cells
producing significant amounts of IL-4, IL-5 or IL-13 (Supplementary figure 3).

Protective efficacy of one- and two-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine regimes in aged rhesus
macaques
Thirteen weeks after the first Ad26.COV2.S dose, the one-dose 1x1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S group,
two-dose 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S group and the sham control group were inoculated with a total
dose of 1x105 tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID50) SARS-COV-2 strain Leiden-0008, by the
intranasal and intratracheal route. To increase statistical power, data from a challenge of naïve
animals (n=4) using an identical challenge strain, challenge regimen and readouts were added to
the sham control group data, collectively referred to as pooled control. Viral loads were assessed
by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), measuring
subgenomic messenger RNA (sgmRNA) (Wölfel et al., 2020) levels in nasal and tracheal swabs
daily during the follow-up period. Low levels of virus were detected in the nose and trachea of
some vaccinated animals. In the nose, the median number of days that virus was present in each
animal was 0.5 days (range 0-3 days) and in the trachea 2.5 days (range 1-5 days) for the single
dose 1x1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S group. For the two-dose 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S group, median
number of days virus was present in the nose of each animal was 1 day (range 0-2 days), and in
the trachea 3 days (range 2-4 days). By contrast, in the pooled control group virus was present in
the nose for the entire follow-up period for all, except one animal that was consistently negative
for nose viral sgmRNA (median of 7 days, range 0-7 days), while in the trachea the median
number of days virus was present was 6 days (range 4-7 days) for each animal (Supplementary

figure 5). Quantification of total viral load in the follow-up period per animal determined by
calculating area under the curve (AUC), showed that total viral load was significantly lower in
both vaccinated groups compared to the pooled control group in both samples, from the nose
(p≤0.012, Tobit ANOVA z test) as well as from the trachea (p≤0.013, Tobit ANOVA z test; Figure
4A). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were collected at regular intervals during the followup period for assessment of viral sgmRNA as well. Only one animal had detectable viral sgmRNA
just above the limit of detection in the two-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine group, while it was
consistently present at high levels in BAL samples from all control animals (Figure 4B and
Supplementary figure 5). The single dose Ad26.COV2.S group was not sampled for BAL due to
restrictions in the number of animals that can be handled in the Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) facility.
At day 7 and 8 all animals were euthanized and lung tissue was collected. The majority of both
one and two-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated animals did not show virus above the limit of
quantification in any of the lung lobes tested, while all lung lobes from pooled control animals
except one contained viral sgmRNA, with the majority of these at high levels (Figure 4C).
The animals showed no overt clinical signs after virus infection and clinical chemistry parameters
in blood were normal Body temperature was continuously measured throughout the study. Prechallenge data were used to reconstruct a daily baseline temperature profile for each individual
animal. Fever, defined as temperature increase above baseline was recorded post-infection and

Histological analysis of lung tissue at the end of the study showed minimal pulmonary pathology
in vaccinated animals, with minimal to mild mononuclear (macrophages and lymphocytes) or
mixed cell infiltrates (macrophages, lymphocytes and scattered neutrophils). in the interstitium
and alveolar lumina minimal to mild perivascular cuffing and focal bronchiolo-alveolar
hyperplasia was observed (Figure 5A -B -D, -E). Immunohistochemistry staining for SARS-CoV-2
nucleoprotein (N) detected a few isolated positive pneumocytes in a single lung lobe in 1 out of
11 vaccinated animals. (Figure 5 G-H). By contrast, sham control animals demonstrated evidence
of viral interstitial pneumonia, characterized mostly by moderate mononuclear or mixed cell
infiltrate in the interstitium, mild to moderate type II pneumocyte hyperplasia/bronchioloalveolar hyperplasia and alveolar lumina containing edema (homogenous eosinophilic fluid)
admixed with mononuclear or mixed cell infiltrates (Figure 5C, -F). In 7 out of 8 sham

Discussion
We previously reported immunogenicity and protective efficacy data of a single dose of our
COVID-19 vaccine candidate Ad26.COV2.S in adult NHP (Mercado et al., 2020). Here we evaluated
the immunogenicity of one- and two-dose Ad26.COV2.S regimens in adult and aged rhesus
macaques for up to 14 weeks after the first dose, to gain insight into the durability of immunity
after a single dose of this vaccine candidate and the added value of a second dose on the
magnitude of spike protein-specific immune responses. In addition, we assessed the protective
efficacy of one- and two-dose Ad26.COV2.S regimens in aged NHP. We used a new challenge
model based on the D614G spike SARS-CoV-2 variant, which is since spring 2020 the most
prevalent circulating spike variant thus far .
In both adult and aged macaques, spike protein-binding and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody
responses were detected as early as two weeks after the first Ad26.COV2.S immunization and
were significantly increased by week 4 in complete agreement with our clinical trial observations
in adults and elderly after a single immunization with Ad26.COV2.S (Sadoff et al., 2021)

Humoral immune responses were maintained at least up to week 14 post-immunization,
providing an early sign of the durability of immunity elicited by Ad26.COV2.S. Binding and
neutralizing antibody responses showed some decline over time, while neutralizing antibody
responses appeared to be more stably maintained, especially in recipients of the 5x1010 vp dose
level. Although humoral immune responses were initially significantly higher in NHP that received
the 1x1011 vp dose as compared to recipients of the 5x1010 vp vaccine dose, differences in
neutralizing antibody levels decreased over time and do not suggest a clear benefit of the higher
dose, in agreement with interim Phase 1/2a clinical data (Sadoff et al., 2021).
A second dose of Ad26.COV2.S given with an 8 week interval resulted in a significant increase in
spike protein-specific binding and neutralizing antibody responses, in both adult and aged NHP.
This is in line with our data in humans (Sadoff et al., 2021) and with observations with other Ad26based vaccines (Geisbert et al., 2011; Callendret et al., 2018; Salisch et al., 2019; Baden et al.,
2013; Salisch et al., 2021).
Neutralizing antibody titers were higher in animals that received the two vaccine doses 8-weeks
apart as compared to the 4-week interval, albeit both two-dose regimens were more
immunogenic than the one-dose regimen. This confirms that a longer interval between vaccine
doses can significantly improve the magnitude and/or quality of the antibody response.
(Ledgerwood et al., 2013; Siegrist, 2018; Sallusto et al., 2010; Roozendaal et al., 2020) While we
have not evaluated the potential difference in efficacy of longer and shorter two-dose regimens
in NHP, a two-doses regimen of 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S administrated 8-weeks apart is currently
being tested for efficacy in humans (ENSEMBLE 2, NCT04614948).

Despite the fact that different virus neutralization assays were used, we observed a strong
correlation between binding and neutralizing antibody titers in sera from vaccinated adult and
aged NHP across time points. These data confirm our earlier observation (Yu et al., 2020;
Mercado et al., 2020; McMahan et al., 2020) and suggest that spike protein-binding antibody
concentrations measured by ELISA could be used as a surrogate readout for neutralizing antibody
responses.
Almost all Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated aged NHP that were challenged three months after first
immunization, were protected from lung infection, as demonstrated by negative PCR testing for
sgmRNA in BAL and lung tissue samples. Only one Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated animal that received
a single vaccination, had clearly detectable SARS-CoV-2 sgmRNA levels as well as traces of viral
antigen detected by immunohistochemistry in lung tissue samples. This animal had much lower
binding and neutralizing antibody levels after vaccination, which could explain the breakthrough
infection, as protection from infection in earlier studies was correlated with binding and
neutralizing antibody titers (Mercado et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020; McMahan et al., 2020)
Nevertheless, viral load in this animal was lower as compared to viral load in lungs of challenged
control animals. While complete protection apparently requires a higher neutralizing antibody
titers in this particular animal model, it is tempting to speculate that the viral load reduction in
lung associated with lower neutralizing antibody titers could translate in protection from severe
disease even in low human vaccine responders. Indeed, while histological analysis and
immunohistochemistry on lung tissue showed severe pulmonary histopathology and presence of
viral antigens in challenged control animals, only minimal histopathological abnormalities and
viral antigens in lungs of Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated animals was observed, in agreement with

earlier observations (Corbett et al., 2020). We observed a small but persistent decrease in the
febrile response post-infection in vaccinated animals. Although transient fever has been
described after SARS-CoV-2 infection of rhesus macaques (Munster et al., 2020), no effect on
temperature was observed in recent NHP vaccine efficacy studies (Chen et al., 2020) (Wang et
al., 2020). In addition to differences in respect to the NHP models used in other studies like age
and challenge virus, an important advantage in this study might be that the body temperature
was continuously monitored and no additional interventions, were required to record
temperature. Continuously temperature monitoring might therefore be a useful clinical
parameter in NHP vaccine efficacy models.
The only partial protection of the upper respiratory tract observed in our present study seems at
odds with our previous NHP study, in which Ad26.COV2.S elicited immunity provided complete
and near-complete protection against viremia in lung and upper respiratory tract, respectively
(Mercado et al., 2020). Several factors may contribute to this difference in outcome. NHP in our
current study were aged and the time of challenge after immunization was considerably longer,
albeit that antibody titers were not waning. Additionally, the G614 SARS-CoV-2 challenge strain
instead of the Washington D614 challenge strain was used. and was reported to be associated
with enhanced viral replication in the upper respiratory tract and potential enhanced viral
transmissibility , but with no associated increase in disease severity (Plante et al., 2020; Hou et
al., 2020).
It is important to emphasize that Ad26.COV2.S elicited immunity is protective against SARS-CoV2 with either the D (Mercado et al., 2020) or the G at amino acid position 614 of the spike protein.

However, with newly emerging variants, the constant monitoring of strain coverage by vaccine
elicited immunity will continue to be of utmost importance.
Derisking for the potential and theoretical risk of Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Respiratory
Disease (VAERD)(Lee et al., 2020; Bottazzi et al., 2020; Haynes et al., 2020), which is generally
considered to be associated with non-neutralizing antibody responses and Th2-skewed cellular
immunity, is an important aspect in the development of COVID-19 vaccines. Here we show that
in aged NHP, Ad26.COV2.S elicited CD4+ T cell responses that were Th1 skewed, confirming our
observations in elderly humans (Sadoff et al., 2021) and similar to findings with other genetic
vaccine platforms encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein(van Doremalen et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020;
Anderson et al., 2020; Vogel et al., 2020; Corbett et al., 2020). The ability of NHP to develop a
Th2 skewed immune response was demonstrated by vaccination with an Al(OH)3-adjuvanted
spike protein. The Th1-skewed response in Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated NHP together with the
induction of robust and durable neutralizing antibody responses by Ad26.COV2.S and absence of
enhanced lung pathology in challenged animals, indicate that the potential for VAERD with this
vaccine is extremely unlikely.
Overall, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy data presented in this manuscript further
support our decision to evaluate a single 5x1010 vp dose of Ad26.COV2.S in our Phase 3
ENSEMBLE (Trial Number: NCT04505722) study and also to evaluate a two-dose Ad26.COV2.S
regimen in our second Phase 3 study ENSEMBLE 2 (Trial Number: NCT04614948)..

Materials and methods Animals
Adult NHP – The NHP study of adult animals was conducted at Charles River Laboratories (CRL)
Montreal ULC, Laval Site (CA). Animals were obtained from Kunmings Biomed international Ltd,
China. Prior to transfer from test facility colony, all animals were subjected to a health
assessment and tested at least once for tuberculosis by intradermal injection of tuberculin. An
anthelmintic treatment was administered to each animal by subcutaneous injection. The
evaluations were performed in accordance with the standard operating procedures by technical
staff. Animal experiment approval was provided by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) at CRL Montreal ULC, Laval Site (CA). Animal experiments were performed in
compliance with Guidelines published by the Canadian Council on Animal Care and the Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Research Council Canada. The
Test Facility is accredited by the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) and the American
Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). In addition, the study was
conducted according to EMA guideline, ICH M3(R2): Guidance on Non-Clinical Safety Studies for
the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals and FDA
guideline, Redbook 2000: General Guidelines for Designing and Conducting Toxicity Studies.
Aged NHP – The study using aged NHP was performed at the Biomedical Primate Research
Centre, Rijswijk, The Netherlands (an AAALAC-accredited institution). Animals were captive-bred
for research purposes and socially housed. Animal housing was according to international
guidelines for NHP care and use (The European Council Directive 2010/63, and Convention ETS
123, including the revised Appendix A as well the ‘Standard for humane care and use of
Laboratory Animals by Foreign institutions’ identification number A5539-01, provided by the

Department of Health and Human Services of the United States of America’s National Institutes
of Health (NIH)). The study was conducted in compliance with, and approved by, all relevant local
and national regulations and the Institutional Animal Welfare Body (Instantie voor Dierenwelzijn,
IvD) guarded that all possible precautions were taken to ensure the welfare and to avoid any
unnecessary discomfort to the animals.

Vaccines
The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine has been generated as previously described (Bos et al., 2020). Briefly,
Ad26.COV2.S is a replication-incompetent Ad26 vector encoding a prefusion-stabilized SARSCOV-2 spike protein sequence (Wuhan Hu1; GenBank accession number: MN908947).
Replication-incompetent, E1/E3-deleted Ad26-vectors were engineered using the AdVac system
(Abbink et al., 2007), using a single plasmid technology containing the Ad26 vector genome
including a transgene expression cassette. The human codon optimized, prefusion-stabilized,
SARS-COV-2 spike protein encoding gene was inserted into the E1-position of the Ad26 vector
genome. Manufacturing of the Ad26 vector was performed in the complementing cell line PER.C6
TetR (Wunderlich et al., 2018; Zahn et al., 2012). The negative control vector Ad26.RSV.gLuc
encodes the RSV F protein fused to Gaussia firefly luciferase as a single transgene separated by
a 2A peptide sequence, resulting in expression of both individual proteins. Manufacturing of the
vector was performed in PER.C6 (Sanders et al., 2013).
The full-length spike protein used for immunization (COR200099) (Bos et al., 2020) was produced
on Expi293F cells. COR200099 is based on the Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 strain (MN908947) and
stabilized by two point mutations (R682A, R685G) in the S1/S2 junction that disrupts the furin

cleavage site, and by two consecutive prolines (K986P, V987P) in the hinge region in S2. In
addition, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions have been replaced by a fibritin foldon
domain for trimerization and a C-tag, allowing the protein to be produced and purified as soluble
protein. Adenoviral vectors and protein were tested for bioburden and endotoxin levels prior to
use.

Study design animal experiments
Adult NHP – 60 (57 females and 3 males. 3 males were allocated to test groups 3, 4 and 5, 1 male
in each group ) rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) from Chinese origin between 3.3 to 5.0 years
of age and weighting between 2.9 to 8.1 kg, were assigned to five groups by a randomizing
stratification system based on body weights. Fourteen animals were included in each vaccine
group and four animals were included in the sham control group. Group 1 (n=4) is the sham
control group and received saline injection at week 0 and week 8. group 2 and 3 (n=14 each
group) received one immunization with 1x1011 vp and 5x1010 vp of Ad26. COV2.S, respectively, at
week 0. Group 4 and 5 (n=14 each group) received two immunizations with 5x1010 vp of Ad26.
COV.2 spaced by four (week 0 and week 4) and eight weeks (week 0 and week 8), respectively.
All immunizations were performed via the intramuscular route in the quadriceps muscle of the
left hind leg. Blood for serum was obtained prior to the first vaccine dose and every 2 weeks
subsequently up to week 14 of the study.
Aged NHP - 20 female rhesus macaques (Macaca Mulatta), aged between 13.75 and 21.9 years
of age and weighting between 6.6-12.6 kg, were distributed over 4 experimental treatment
groups and housed in ABSL-III facilities, pair-housed with socially compatible animals. Prior to

COV2.S at week 0 and 8. Group 3 (n=4) received 100 µg spike protein, adjuvanted with 500 µg
Aluminum Hydroxide (Al(OH)3; 2% Alhydrogel, InvivoGen) at week 0 an 8. The sham control group
(Group 4, n=4) was immunized with 1x1011 vp Ad26.RSV.gLuc, an Ad26 vector expressing an
irrelevant antigen. All immunizations were performed intramuscularly in quadriceps of the left
hind leg. Blood for serum and PBMC isolation was obtained as indicated in the text. Five weeks
after the second vaccination dose all groups, except the Al(OH)3-adjuvanted spike protein group,
were inoculated with 1x105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Leiden-0008. Clinical isolate SARS-CoV2/human/NLD/Leiden-0008/2020 (Leiden-0008) was isolated from a RT-PCR positive throat swab
and passaged twice in Vero E6 cells. The spike protein of this isolate contains the D614G
mutation. The NGS-derived complete genome sequence of this virus isolate is available under
GenBank accession number MT705206.1 and showed only minor variants from the consensus
sequence, especially in the spike furin cleavage site region we detected below 2% of
heterogeneity. Isolate Leiden-0008 was propagated and titrated in Vero E6 cells. The inoculum
was administered in a 2 mL volume, 1 mL intratracheally and 1 mL intranasally, 0.5 mL per nostril.
After virus inoculation, nose and trachea swabs were taken daily, as well as BAL every other day
from the two-dose 5x1010 vp Ad26. COV2.S and sham control groups, to measure viral load. As
animals were anaesthetized on a daily basis, tube feeding was applied. Animals were euthanized
at day 7 and 8 after virus inoculation, with the number of animals of each group approximately
distributed over both days, and respiratory tract tissues were isolated for histopathology,

immunohistochemistry and viral load. To increase statistical power, the data from the sham
control group was pooled with data from the pilot virus inoculation study, consisting of naïve
animals (n=4) of the same age range that were inoculated identically as the described above for
the vaccine study. One animal in the 5x1010 vp Ad26.COV2.S group died during the study.
Postmortem autopsy identified a marked to severe, acute bronchopneumonia associated with
foreign particulate material in the airways, which is consistent with aspiration pneumonia in the
lung as the cause of death of this animal. The death was therefore deemed unrelated to the
vaccine and the animal was excluded from all other analyses.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
IgG binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was measured by ELISA using a recombinant spike
protein antigen based on the Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 strain (MN908947). The SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein antigen was adsorbed on 96 well microplates for a minimum of 16 hours at 4°C. Following
incubation, plates were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/0.05% Tween-20 and blocked
with 5% skim milk in PBS/0.05% Tween-20 for 1 hour at room temperature. Serum standards,
controls and NHP serum samples were diluted and incubated on the plates for 1 hour at room
temperature. Next, the plates were washed and incubated with peroxidase conjugated goat anti
human IgG for 1 hour at room temperature, washed, and developed with tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB) substrate for 30 minutes at room temperature and protected from light, then stopped
with H2SO4. The optical density was read at 450/620 nm. The antibody concentrations were back
calculated on the standard and the reportable value were generated based on all passing
dilutions, expressed in ELISA units [EU]/mL. The LLOD is 3.4 EU/mL, based on the standard lowest
interpolation range concentration multiplied per the dilution factor and is used as an informative

LLOD. LLOQ is based on qualification performed for human samples and has been set on 50.3
EU/mL.

Pseudovirus neutralization assay (psVNA)
SARS-CoV-2 S neutralizing antibody titers were measured by pseudovirus neutralizing assay.
Pseudotyped virus particles were made from a modified Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSVΔG)
backbone and bear the S glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2. The pseudoparticles contain a
luciferase reporter gene used for detection. Serial dilutions of heat-inactivated NHP serum
samples were prepared in 96-well transfer plates. The SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was added
sequentially to the serum dilutions and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 supplementation for 60 ±
5 minutes. Serum-virus complexes were then transferred onto plates, previously seeded
overnight with Vero E6 cells, and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 20 ± 2 hours. Following this
incubation, the luciferase substrate was added to the cells in order to assess the level of
luminescence per well. The plates were then read on a luminescence plate reader. The intensity
of the luminescence was quantified in relative luminescence units (RLU). The neutralizing titer of
a serum sample was calculated as the reciprocal serum dilution corresponding to the 50%
neutralization antibody titer (IC50) for that sample. The LLOD is 10, which is the first sample
dilution (1:10) used as an informative LLOD. LLOQ is based on qualification performed for human
samples has been set on 33 IC50.

Wildtype virus neutralization assay (wtVNA)
Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC)assay – Neutralization assays against live SARS-CoV-2
were performed using the microneutralization assay as previously described (Bos et al., 2020),

with the modification of a different strain used, SARS-CoV-2 isolate Leiden-0008. Isolate Leiden0008 (GenBank accession number: MT705206.1) was propagated and titrated in Vero E6 cells
using the TCID50 endpoint dilution method and the TCID50 was calculated by the Spearman-Kärber
algorithm as previously described (Hierholzer and Killington, 1996) All work with live SARS-CoV2 was performed in a BSL3 facility at Leiden University Medical Center. Vero-E6 cells were seeded
at 12,000 cells/well in 96-well tissue culture plates one day prior to infection. Heat-inactivated
(30 minutes at 56°C) serum samples were analyzed in duplicate. The panel of sera were two-fold
serially diluted in duplicate, with an initial dilution of 1:10 and a final dilution of 1:1280 in 60 μL
eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, 2 mM
L- glutamine and 2% fetal calf serum (FCS). Diluted sera were mixed with equal volumes of 120
TCID50/60 µL Leiden -0008 virus and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The virus-serum mixtures were
then added onto Vero E6 cell monolayers and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere
with 5 % CO2. Cells either unexposed to the virus or mixed with 120 TCID 50/60 µL SARS-CoV-2
were used as negative (uninfected) and positive (infected) controls, respectively. At three days
post-infection, cells were fixed and inactivated with 40 µL 37% formaldehyde/PBS solution/well
overnight at 4 °C. The fixative was removed from cells and the clusters were stained with 50
µL/well crystal violet solution, incubated for 10 minutes and rinsed with water. Dried plates were
evaluated for viral cytopathic effect. Neutralization titer was calculated by dividing the number
of positive wells with complete inhibition of the virus-induced cytopathogenic effect, by the
number of replicates, and adding 2.5 to stabilize the calculated ratio. The neutralizing antibody
titer was defined as the log2 reciprocal of this value. A SARS-CoV-2 back-titration was included
with each assay run to confirm that the dose of the used inoculum was within the acceptable

range of 30 to 300 TCID50Public Health England (PHE) assay - Neutralizing antibodies capable of
inhibiting wild type virus infections were quantified using the wildtype virus microneutralization
assay (MNA) that was developed and qualified for human samples by PHE. The virus stocks used
were derived from the Victoria/1/2020 strain (GenBank accession number: MT007544.1).
In brief, 6 two-fold serial dilutions of the heat-inactivated NHP serum samples were prepared in
96-well transfer plate(s). The SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus was subsequently added to the serum
dilutions at a target working concentration (approximately 100 plaque-forming units [PlaqueForming Unit (PFU)]/well) and incubated at 37°C for 60 to 90 minutes. The serum-virus mixture
was then transferred onto assay plates, previously seeded overnight with Vero E6 African green
monkey kidney cells and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 60 to 90 minutes before the addition
of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) overlay medium and further incubation for 24 hours. Following
this incubation, the cells were fixed and stained using an antibody pair specific for the SARS-CoV2 RBD S protein and immunoplaques were visualized using TrueBlueTM substrate.
Immunoplaques were counted using an Immunospot Analyzer (Cellular Technology Limited,CTL).
The immunoplaque counts were exported to SoftMax Pro (Molecular Devices) and the
neutralizing titer of a serum sample was calculated as the reciprocal serum dilution
corresponding to the 50% neutralization antibody titer (IC50) for that sample.

Enzyme-Linked Immunospot assay (ELISpot)
IFN-  /IL-4 Double-Color was performed on freshly isolated PBMCs. PBMC were isolated from
ethylene diamine tetraaceticacid (EDTA) whole blood using Ficoll gradient centrifugation (10ml
92% Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare) Plus in 1:4 Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS)-

diluted blood) The ELISpot was performed using the ImmunoSpot Human IFN-/IL-4 Double-Color
Enzymatic ELISpot Assay Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Cellular Technology
Limited). Ethanol-activated 96-well ELISpot plates were coated overnight with anti-human IFN- 
and IL-4 capture antibodies. Cells were plated at a concentration of 250,000 cells per well and
stimulated with either cell culture medium in presence of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 2 pools of
consecutive 15-mer peptides with 11 amino acid overlap (JPT) spanning the entire length of the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at a peptide concentration of 2 µg/mL, or 1 µg/mL phytohemagglutinin
(PHA) as positive control for 22 hours. Analysis was performed using the CTL ImmunoSpot
Analyzer and ImmunoSpot Software (Cellular Technology). Spot-forming units per 1.0 × 106
PBMCs were calculated by subtraction of medium stimulus counts of the individual peptide pools
per animal and summed across the 2 peptide pools.

Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS)
For analysis of intracellular cytokine expression, 1x106 freshly isolated PBMC were stimulated at
37 °C overnight (approximately 15 hours) with either cell culture medium in presence of DMSO,
2 µg/mL SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide pools (as described for ELISpot), or 5 µg/mL PHA in
the presence of GolgiStop (BD Biosciences). Stimulated cells were first incubated with LIVE/DEAD
Aqua viability dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific), followed by surface staining with anti-human
monoclonal antibodies CD3-PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone SP34-2, cat. nr. 552852), CD4-APC H7 (clone
L200, cat. .nr. 560837), CD8-BV650 (clone SK1, cat. nr. 565289), CD14-BV605 (clone M5E2, cat.
nr. 564054), CD69-BV786 (clone FN50, cat. nr. 563834), all from BD Biosciences, and CD20-BV605
(Biolegend, clone 2H7, cat. nr. 302334). Cells were subsequently fixed with Cytofix/Cytoperm
buffer (BD Biosciences) and stained intracellularly with anti-human IL-2-PE (clone MQ1-17H12,

cat. nr. 560709), IFN--APC (clone B27, cat. nr. 554702) from BD Biosciences, IL-5-Vio515 (clone
JES1-39D10, cat. nr. 130-108-099, Miltenyi Biotec), IL-4-PE Dazzle594 (clone MP4-25D2, cat. nr.
500832) and IL-13-BV421 (clone JES10-5A2, cat. nr. 501916), both from Biolegend. Sample
acquisition was performed on a LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and data were analysed in FlowJo
V10 (TreeStar). Antigen-specific T cells were identified by consecutive gating on single cells (FSCH versus FSC-A), live cells, size (lymphocytes) (FSC-A versus SSC-A), CD3+, CD4+ or CD8+ cells and
CD69+ plus cytokine-positive (the gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig. 4). Cytokinepositive responses are presented after subtraction of the background response detected in the
corresponding medium stimulated sample of each individual animal. Responders were defined
by a technical threshold (Bowyer et al., 2018), the theoretical ability to detect at least 1 event in
a cytokine gate and here defined as the reciprocal of the average number of CD4 or CD8 T cells
of the medium and peptide pool stimulated samples for each assay run. CD4 Th1 and Th2 T cell
subsets were defined by Boolean gating. Th1 subset consists of CD4+CD69+ T cells expressing IFN and/or IL-2 but not IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, the Th2 subset was defined as CD4+CD69+ T cells
expressing IL-4 and/or IL-5 and/or IL-13.

RNA isolation and SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic mRNA assay
RNA was extracted from homogenized lung tissue and from BAL fluid, trachea, and nasal swabs,
by use of the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Viral E gene-derived subgenomic messenger RNA (sgmRNA) was quantified using
the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen,
Darmstadt, Germany), with 400 nM concentration of the forward or reverse primer and 200 nM
of probe in a 25 µl reaction. The sequence of the sg-leader-specific forward primer, as well as the

E-gene specific reverse primer and probe were previously published (Wölfel et al., 2020) Reverse
transcription was performed at 50oC for 15 minutes, followed by enzyme activation at 95oC for 2
minutes and 40 PCR cycles of 95oC for 15 seconds and 60oC for 30 seconds. An RNA standard was
prepared from a pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing the complete E gene behind the SARS-CoV-2
subgenomic leader sequence (nucleotides. 1-77 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome). Serial dilution of
sgm RNA standard with known number of copies was taken along to calculate sgmRNA in copies
per ml for swabs or copies per gram tissue. The LLOQs were 2.1x103 copies per mL and 1x104
copies per gram tissue, except for the naïve animals that contributed to the pooled control group,
for which the LLOQs were 1.1x104 copies per ml and 5x104 copies per gram tissue.

Body temperature analysis
A baseline 24-hour body temperature cycle was reconstructed per animal using a multi-day
window prior to virus inoculation in which no biotechnical interventions occurred. Fever
duration, defined as the net increase in body temperature was calculated as difference relative
to the mean of the baseline cycle at corresponding clock times during the first 6 days of the
follow-up period. The lower limit of the temperature difference with the baseline was set at zero
to reduce the impact of lower body temperatures during daily post-challenge anesthesia and the
AUC of the net temperature increase in this period was calculated.

Lung gross pathology, histopathology and immunohistochemistry
At the end of the follow-up period all animals were necropsied by opening the thoracic and
abdominal cavities and all major organs were examined. The extent of pulmonary consolidation
was assessed based on visual estimation of the percentage of affected lung tissue. Nasal mucosa,

pharynx, trachea, bronchi and all lung lobes were collected for histopathological examination and
analysis by immunohistochemistry (IHC). All tissues were immersed in 10% neutral-buffered
formalin for fixation, paraffin embedded and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for
histopathological evaluation. The H&E stained tissue sections were examined by light microscopy
(Zeiss Axioplan). For IHC, paraffin sections of all lung lobes were automatically stained (Ventana
Discovery Ultra, Roche, France), using rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV Nucleocapsid protein
antibody (NP, Novus NB100-56576). The immunohistochemically stained tissue sections were
examined by light microscopy, using a Leica DM2500 light microscope with magnification steps
of 25x, 100x, 200x, and 400x.

Statistical analysis
ELISA and psVNA
For binding and psVNA neutralizing antibody data, comparisons between specific vaccine groups
were made with the two-sample t-test in an analysis-of-variance (ANOVA). Successive time points
were compared using the paired t-test per vaccine group. P values were calculated on log10
transformed values.
wtVNA, ELISpot and ICS
Vaccine groups were compared to the negative control group with the Mann-Whitney U-test.
Pairwise comparison between vaccine groups was performed using Tobit ANOVA with vaccine as
factor if less than 50% of the titers were at LLOD. The pairwise comparisons between vaccines
were done with the z-test. If for an assay any vaccine group had 50% censoring or more, then the
pairwise comparisons were done with the Mann-Whitney U-test.

The difference in titer between consecutive time points was calculated per animal for each assay.
Depending on the number of censored measurements, the differences were compared with a
Tobit ANOVA followed by a post-hoc z test or a sign test.
For all statistical tests the significance level was 5%. No multiple comparison adjustment was
applied. All statistical calculations are done in SAS 9.4. (SAS Institute Inc Cary, NC, US).
Correlation analysis
Correlation analysis between binding antibody concentrations and neutralizing antibody titers or
different neutralization assays was calculated using two-sided Spearman rank-correlation.
Challenge data
Mean nasal and trachea swab area under the curve values of each group were pairwise compared
using Tobit ANOVA with post hoc z-test. Mean net temperature difference AUCs were pairwise
compared between groups by t-test.
