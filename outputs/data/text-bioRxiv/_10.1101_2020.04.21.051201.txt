Abstract
The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic have posed
a public health crisis. Higher morbidity and mortality of men with COVID-19 may be
explained by androgen-driven mechanisms. One such proposed mechanism is androgen
regulation of pulmonary TMPRSS2, the host co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2. We find no
evidence for increased TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in the lungs of males compared to
females in humans or mice. Furthermore, in male mice, treatment with the androgen receptor
antagonist enzalutamide does not decrease pulmonary TMPRSS2 expression. Nevertheless,
regardless of sex, smoking significantly increases the expression of TMPRSS2, which reverts
back to never-smoker levels in former smokers. Finally, we show that in mouse models,
despite equivalent AR transcript levels, males express markedly higher amounts of AR
protein. If a similar sex-specific regulation of AR protein occurs in human lung, androgens
could play important roles in clinical outcome of COVID-19 through mechanisms other than
TMPRSS2 regulation.

Introduction
The December 2019 outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, has led to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic (Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). The highly contagious nature of the disease as
well as the lack of vaccines or clinically approved treatments has caused a worldwide public
health emergency. Therefore, improved and timely understanding of the human
susceptibilities to SARS-CoV-2 will prove invaluable in controlling the pandemic and
treatment of those affected.
SARS-CoV-2 enters cells using two host cellular proteins: angiotensin converting
enzyme-2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). The virus first employs
ACE2 as a cell entry protein, followed by TMPRSS2-mediated proteolytic processing of the
SARS-2 spike protein, further facilitating viral entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Targeting the
activity or expression of both factors by a plethora of approaches has been proposed as
potential treatment (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Stopsack et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).
TMPRSS2 is also a widely studied androgen-regulated gene in prostate tissue, contributing to
prostate cancer pathogenesis by way of aberrantly driving oncogene expression.
Approximately half of all prostate cancers harbor a fusion that juxtaposes a TMPRSS2
transcriptional regulatory element, which is stimulated by potent androgens and the androgen
receptor (AR), in front of an ERG oncogene. (Tomlins et al., 2005). The end result is AR
stimulation of oncogene expression.
This raises the possibility that the physiological roles of androgens may, at least
partially, account for the sex-specific clinical outcomes (Grasselli et al., 2020; Sharon
Moalem, 2020). Due to its androgen-regulated nature in the prostate and its essential role in
SARS-Cov-2 etiology, TMPRSS2 expression has been postulated to follow a similar pattern
of regulation in pulmonary cells by the potent androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone
(Mikkonen et al., 2010). If this link proves correct, it could pave the path to novel strategies,
including re-purposing of FDA-approved potent androgen synthesis inhibitors or AR
antagonists, such as enzalutamide (Enz) and apalutamide, for the treatment of COVID-19.
These strategies have been the subject of clinical trial discussions (Sharifi and Ryan, 2020;
Stopsack et al., 2020).
Here, we show that there is no evidence for increased TMPRSS2 expression in the
lungs of males. On the other hand, cigarette smoking increases the levels of pulmonary
TMPRSS2 mRNA, which drop back to never-smoker levels after quitting smoking. We
provide in vivo evidence that neither mRNA nor protein levels of TMPRSS2 vary by sex. In

addition, AR-antagonist therapy with Enz does not suppress pulmonary TMPRSS2
expression in eugonadal male mice. Interestingly, despite similar transcript levels, we found
AR protein levels are substantially higher in lungs of male mice compared with females. This
finding, conditional upon validation in human samples, may yet help explain sex differences
in COVID-19 outcomes, but likely in a manner that is independent of TMPRSS2 regulation.
Results
TMPRSS2 and AR transcript expression in human lung are not higher in males than in
females
Considering the poorer clinical outcome of COVID-19 in men, underlying androgen-related
causes are suspected but not presently known. The SARS-Cov-2 co-receptor, TMPRSS2
harbors an AR-responsive enhancer that is induced by male gonadal hormones in prostate
tissue (Wang et al., 2007), raising the possibility of a similar mode of regulation in the
respiratory system. Furthermore, certain pulmonary disease process outcomes, including
asthma, are sex steroid associated (Zein et al., 2020). Therefore, we sought to investigate
whether male sex was associated with higher expression of TMPRSS2 or AR in human lung.
To this end, we acquired the publicly available expression datasets for TMPRSS2 and AR in
non-cancerous lung and associated respiratory tissues from the Genomic Expression
Omnibus (GEO). Across all tissue-type comparisons, we found no evidence for elevated
TMPRSS2 or AR mRNA expression (Fig.1) in males compared with females. Together, these
results suggest that worse clinical manifestations of men with COVID-19 are unlikely to be
associated with TMPRSS2. However, this conclusion is limited to transcriptional information,
and further studies are required to rule out the possibility of protein level differences in the
human respiratory system.

Pulmonary TMPRSS2 expression in mice does not differ by sex and is unaffected by
potent AR blockade
To further explore sex differences in TMPRSS2 expression in animal models, we harvested
lungs from female and male mice treated with control diet or Enz for > 10 days and analyzed
them for protein and mRNA expression. In the case of TMPRSS2, this yielded results
consistent with human expression data: i.e., there were no sex-specific changes. Additionally,
Enz treatment did not downregulate TMPRSS2 (Fig. 2A and B). Given the unchanged AR
protein levels (despite a modest but statistically significant mRNA increase) in Enz-treated
males, we infer that TMPRSS2 is not regulated by AR in the lung. Nevertheless, further

single-cell level experiments are needed to explore the expression pattern of TMPRSS2 in
cellular subsets rather than in bulk lung and respiratory tract.

Similar to TMPRSS2 and also consistent with human data, we found no evidence of sexspecific changes in AR transcript levels of mice (Fig. 2A). However, the lungs of male mice
express considerably higher amounts of AR protein compared with females (Fig. 2B). This
finding begs the question whether human lungs also follow a sex-discordant pattern of AR
protein synthesis or if this is a mouse-specific phenomenon. If the former, androgen-ARmediated changes may yet explain sex-specific differences in COVID-19 outcomes by
TMPRSS2-independent mechanisms.

TMPRSS2 and ACE2 mRNA expression increase in current smokers whereas in former
smokers, expression returns to levels found in never smokers
In addition to male sex, smoking is a risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and poor
clinical outcomes (Zhao et al., 2020). One recent study of 1,099 COVID-19-positive patients
reported a more than two-fold increased risk for intensive care unit admission and death in
smokers as compared with non-smokers (Guan et al., 2020). We identified human expression
GEO datasets of bronchial/airway epithelial cells containing subject smoking status and
asked whether smoking is associated with TMPRSS2 expression. Our analysis indicated a
consistent pattern where expression of both TMPRSS2 (Fig. 3A) and the primary SARS-CoV2 receptor ACE2 (Fig.3B) was modestly but significantly increased in smokers compared
with non-smokers. Interestingly, the levels were downregulated to never-smoker levels in
former smokers. The results of our analysis are in keeping with several recent reports on
ACE2 and smoking (Brake et al., 2020; Leung et al., 2020; Smith and Sheltzer, 2020).
Although the p-values range widely across different data sets, almost all the data sets show
changes in a consistently increased direction for current smokers including multiple data sets
with small p-values (Fig. 3A and B).
For both TMPRSS2 (Fig. 3C) and ACE2 (Fig. 3D), there was no correlation between
smoking pack years and mRNA expression in both current and former smokers, suggesting
that the change does not build up over time but is instead a rapid process – akin to a switch.
Discussion
Sex-associated clinical outcomes have been long observed in a variety of infectious and
inflammatory conditions. Sex steroids (i.e., androgens and estrogens) are possible mediators

of these biologic differences.

For COVID-19, potential androgen-mediated biologic

differences include 1) TMPRSS2 regulation and 2) immune modulation (Sharifi and Ryan,
2020; Stopsack et al., 2020). Our study addresses the first of these possibilities.
Although AR protein is clearly expressed in the male mouse lung at levels higher than
in females, we find no evidence for androgen regulation of TMPRSS2. This evidence
includes 1) the absence of any TMPRSS2 increase in male compared with female human lung
2) no TMPRSS2 increase in male compared with female mouse lung 3) no evidence for
TMPRSS2 suppression with next generation AR antagonist treatment. Therefore, given that
AR protein is higher in male lungs, it is possible that AR-dependent transcription in the male
lung mediates biologic differences independent of TMPRSS2 expression that are important
for driving sex-dependent differences in clinical outcomes. This has yet to be determined.
Limitations of our study include the fact that we cannot rule out cell type-specific
differences in sex-associated or androgen-dependent TMPRSS2 regulation in pulmonary
tissues. Nevertheless, early autopsy studies of COVID-19 appear to show diffuse viral
damage that may suggest that the expression of viral host cell receptors is likely not limited
to an isolated pulmonary subset of cells (Barton et al., 2020). Although we did perform
immunohistochemical staining studies for TMPRSS2 expression in the mouse lung, we
encountered different patterns compared to human prostate tissue, in which TMPRSS2 is a
membrane/cell surface protein. The mouse lung lacked cytoplasmic and membrane staining
but expressed significant nuclear stain. This led us to conclude that much of the antibody
binding in mouse was non-specific.
The possibility of suppressing androgen-regulated TMPRSS2 expression as a required
SARS-CoV-2 host protein was an attractive hypothesis that may also be tested with clinical
trials of next-generation anti-androgens (Sharifi and Ryan, 2020; Stopsack et al., 2020).
However, our data do not support this hypothesis and we would urge caution in prioritizing
COVID-19 clinical trials.
Sexually dimorphic AR expression in an organ not associated with sexual
differentiation – the male lung – raises the question of function. This is reminiscent of
sexually dimorphic AR protein expression in the male human kidney, in which AR function
includes regulating glucocorticoid metabolism and downstream steroid receptor activity
(Alyamani et al., 2020). Whether this physiology also occurs in the lung has yet to be
determined.
In conclusion, we find no evidence for androgen regulation of TMPRSS2 in the male
lung. Therefore, TMPRSS2 regulation in the lung appears to fundamentally differ from a

clear androgen-dependent effect in prostatic tissues.

Pulmonary TMPRSS2 regulation

appears not to account for the sex-discordance in COVID-19 clinical outcomes. In contrast,
both TMPRSS2 and ACE2 appear to have increased expression in current smokers. It is not
yet known whether these changes in expression have a functional impact on COVID-19
infection, but if they do, the results suggest smokers could partly mitigate their increased risk
by quitting smoking. This also raises the question of whether other hazards such as high
levels of air pollution could have similar effects. Nevertheless, a recent study reports that
ACE2 expression is not upregulated by lung disease or exposure to carcinogens (Smith and
Sheltzer, 2020). Together, these data suggest that induction of ACE2, and perhaps
TMPRSS2, is mediated by specific types of tissue injury.

Materials and methods
Mice, treatments and lung harvest
Mouse studies were performed under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute. A cohort of
adult NSG mice (> 6 weeks old) were obtained from Cleveland Clinic Biological Resources
Unit. The male mice were arbitrarily divided between two groups receiving control chow or
Enz diet 62.5mg/kg. Following 11 days on diet, the mice were sacrificed using a lethal dose
of Nembutal followed by cardiac puncture. Once sacrificed, the abdominal and thoracic
cavities of the mice were opened, the inferior vena cava was cut, and the lungs were gently
perfused with warm saline via the right ventricle. Next, the lungs were removed, and the
individual lobes were either fixed with 10% formalin for paraffin embedding or snap frozen
for subsequent RNA or protein analysis.

Protein and mRNA expression analysis
Approximately 40–50 mg freshly frozen lung was added to soft tissue homogenizing CK14
tubes (Betin Technologies) with 200 ml RIPA buffer containing HALT protease and
phosphate inhibitor cocktail. Lung tissues were then homogenized with a homogenizer
(Minilys, Betin Technologies) three times (60 s each time) at the highest speed, with 5-10
minute intervals on ice to cool lysates. The lysates were then centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000
x g and the supernatants were collected for immunoblot analysis with antibodies for
TMPRSS2 (Abcam: ab92323 and Proteintech: 14437-1-AP), AR (EMD Millipore: PG-21
and Santa Cruz Biotechnology: N-20) and GAPDH (D16H11).

Total RNA was harvested by homogenizing 25 mg lung tissue in 350 µl RLT buffer
(RNeasy kit, Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA synthesis were then
carried out with the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
analysis was conducted in triplicate in an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR machine (Applied
Biosystems) using iTaq Fast SYBR Green Supermix with ROX (Bio-Rad) with the following

Gene expression in human lung
The public genomics data repository Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo)
was searched for data sets containing expression profiling of samples from non-cancerous
human lung and bronchial/airway epithelial cells with samples identified by gender and/or
smoking status of subjects. The following data sets were identified: GSE994 (airway
epithelial cells from current/former/never smokers), GSE4115 (histologically normal
bronchial epithelial cells from smokers with and without lung cancer), GSE7895 (airway
epithelial cells from current/former/never smokers), GSE16008 (bronchial epithelial cells
from healthy current and never smokers), GSE18385 (large and small airway epithelial cells
from healthy current and never smokers), GSE37147 (bronchial epithelial cells from current
and former smokers with and without COPD), GSE43696 (bronchial epithelial cells from
asthma patients and healthy controls), GSE63127 (small airway epithelial cells from healthy
current and never smokers), GSE103174 (lung tissue from smokers and nonsmokers with and
without COPD), and GSE123352 (non-involved lung parenchyma from ever and never
smokers with lung adenocarcinoma). TMPRSS2, AR, and ACE2 gene expression values
were obtained from each data set and analyses for comparisons between groups (for each data
set for which gender and/or current smoking status information was available) were
performed using R.

(normalized so that the mean within each data set equals 1) from publicly available GEO data
sets. N for each data set: GSE16008 = 13 current smoker/13 never smoker; GSE18385 large
airway = 32 current smoker/20 never smoker; GSE18385 small airway = 58 current
smoker/51 never smoker; GSE37147 = 99 current smoker/139 former smoker; GSE61327 =
112 current smoker/71 never smoker; GSE7895 = 52 current smoker/31 former smoker/21

never smoker; GSE994 = 34 current smoker/18 former smoker/23 never smoker. Data sets
18385, 63127, 7895, and 994 contained multiple TMPRSS2 reference sequences and the
expression values of the different sequences were added together within each data set. In all
of the data sets that contained four TMPRSS2 reference sequences (18385 both large and
small airway and 63127), the difference between groups was largest for reference sequence
AI660243, so expression using that reference sequence alone is also shown for those data
sets. For data sets with two groups, p-values from t-tests are shown. For data sets with three
groups, Tukey HSD p-values are shown that were obtained after one-way ANOVA (ANOVA
p-values: GSE7895 0.009, GSE994 0.033). (B) Box plot of ACE2 expression from the same
data sets as in (A). Data sets 18385 and 63127 contained multiple ACE2 reference sequences
and the expression values of the different sequences were added together. For data sets with
two groups, p-values from t-tests are shown. For data sets with three groups, Tukey HSD pvalues are shown that were obtained after one-way ANOVA (ANOVA p-values: GSE7895
0.82, GSE994 0.010). (C) Scatter plots of normalized TMPRSS2 expression vs. smoking pack
years for current and former smokers in all the data sets that contained smoking pack year
values, showing the lack of correlation between TMPRSS2 expression and smoking pack
years. Adjusted R-squared and p-values from linear fits for each data set: GSE16008 R2 =
0.04 and p = 0.17; GSE18385 large airway R2 = -0.03 and p = 0.63; GSE18385 small airway
R2 = -0.02 and p = 0.99; GSE37147 (current smokers) R2 = -0.01 and p = 0.47; GSE37147
(former smokers) R2 = 0.03 and p = 0.03; GSE7895 (current smokers) R2 = 0.003 and p =
0.29; GSE7895 (former smokers) R2 = -0.03 and p = 0.74. (D) Scatter plots of normalized
ACE2 expression vs. smoking pack years for current and former smokers in all the data sets
that contained smoking pack year values, showing the lack of correlation between ACE2
expression and smoking pack years. Adjusted R-squared and p-values from linear fits for
each data set: GSE16008 R2 = 0.03 and p = 0.19; GSE18385 large airway R2 = -0.03 and p =
0.76; GSE18385 small airway R2 = -0.01 and p = 0.41; GSE37147 (current smokers) R2 = 0.01 and p = 0.67; GSE37147 (former smokers) R2 = 0.001 and p = 0.30; GSE7895 (current
smokers) R2 = 0.01 and p = 0.24; GSE7895 (former smokers) R2 = -0.02 and p = 0.60.
