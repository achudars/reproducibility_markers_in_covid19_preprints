Abstract
Here we present a rapid and versatile method for capturing and concentrating SARS-CoV-2 from
transport medium and saliva using affinity-capture magnetic hydrogel particles. We demonstrate
that the method concentrates virus prior to RNA extraction, thus significantly improving detection
of the virus using a real-time RT-PCR assay across a range of viral titers, from 100 to 1,000,000
viral copies/mL; in particular, detection of virus in low viral load samples is enhanced when using
the method coupled with the IDT 2019-nCoV CDC EUA Kit. This method is compatible with
commercially available nucleic acid extraction kits, as well with a simple heat and detergent
method. Using transport medium diagnostic remnant samples that previously had been tested for
SARS-CoV-2 using either the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA Test (n=14) or the Cepheid
Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 EUA Test (n=35), we demonstrate that our method not only correctly
identifies all positive samples (n = 17) but also significantly improves detection of the virus in low
viral load samples. The average improvement in cycle threshold (Ct) value as measured with the
IDT 2019-nCoV CDC EUA Kit was 3.1; n = 10. Finally, to demonstrate that the method could
potentially be used to enable pooled testing, we spiked infectious virus or a confirmed positive
diagnostic remnant sample into 5 mL and 10 mL of negative transport medium and observed
significant improvement in the detection of the virus from those larger sample volumes.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a member of the Coronaviridae
family and is responsible for the pandemic outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
that emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China 1. The disease is
characterized by fever, dry cough, fatigue, anorexia, shortness of breath and myalgia 2,3. COVID19 rapidly spread and by March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
COVID-19 as a global pandemic 4. As of June 7, 2020, there have been more than 7 million
COVID-19 cases and 411,177 deaths worldwide 5. Such a fast-acting and massive outbreak
throughout the world has led to severe impacts on the health care systems and economies of
countries around the globe.
The rapid spread of the virus led to a tremendous increase in demand for COVID-19 diagnostic
testing worldwide. At present, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
recommends diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection via measurement of viral nucleic acid and
antigen tests (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html). Real-time
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) is a reliable and relatively fast
method for the identification of pathogenic nucleic acids in patient samples 6. However, it has
several disadvantages. High quality RNA is critical to real-time RT-PCR assays. Thus, the initial
step often involves purification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from patient samples using commercial
RNA purification kits, which have multiple steps and are time consuming. Moreover, in recent
months, the manufacturers of these kits have struggled to keep up with demand, and there have
been reports of shortages in the United States 7. Another disadvantage is the requirement for
relatively high concentrations of the genetic material in a sample. Although real-time RT-PCR is
considered to be a sensitive method for the detection of nucleic acid, the limit of detection for
SARS-CoV-2 RNA is reported to be between 200 to 77,440 copies/mL, depending on the RNA
extraction method and real-time RT-PCR assay being used 6,8,9.
We sought to address these issues with a method, based on affinity-capture hydrogel particles
(called Nanotrap® particles), that captures and concentrates SARS-CoV-2 from samples to
improve the detection of the virus when used with CDC-recommended SARS-CoV-2 assays.
Here, we demonstrate that a 5-minute Nanotrap particle capture step significantly increases the
sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR assays when used in conjunction with commercial
RNA extraction kits. We also show that Nanotrap particles significantly improve sensitivity of
SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR assays when used with simple heat and detergent extraction
methods, in both saliva and transport medium samples. Furthermore, with this method, we
identified viral RNA in several diagnostic remnant samples that previously had tested negative for
SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we tested and confirmed the ability of a Nanotrap particle method to
improve detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in pooled patient sample mimics, an approach which is
a promising way forward for addressing the massive testing scale-ups that are necessary. Taken
together, the methods here are quick and easy to implement, requiring only a magnetic tube rack
to separate the particles and captured viruses, and they significantly improve the detection
capability of current SARS-CoV-2 test strategies.

Methods and Materials
Cells, Viruses, and Reagents
Vero E6 cells were obtained from ATCC (CRL-1586) and were grown in DMEM complete
medium, consisting of 10% FBS, 5% L-glutamine, and 5% penicillin/streptomycin, at 37°C and
5% CO2. Infectious, replication-competent and heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from
BEI Resources (NR-52281 and NR-52286, respectively). For transport medium experiments,
Puritan UniTranz®-RT Universal Transport Medium (UT-300) was utilized. Nanotrap Magnetic
Virus Particles (SKU 44202) were provided by Ceres Nanosciences Inc. Dulbecco’s phosphatebuffered Saline Solution without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS) was used during viral extraction.
TRIzolTM LS was purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific (Cat. #10296010). Patient pooled saliva
was purchased from BIOIVT (Saliva-1902492).
Diagnostic Remnant Samples
Fourteen diagnostic remnant samples of patient swabs in viral transport media were purchased
from Discovery Life Sciences. Each sample previously had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 using
the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 test. Nine samples (sample ID’s 101-109) previously had
tested positive. Five samples (sample ID’s 110-114) had previously tested negative. An additional
thirty-five diagnostic remnant samples were obtained from Hancock Regional Hospital in
Greenwood, IN, all of which had been previously tested for SARS-CoV-2 using the Cepheid
Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test. Eight samples (sample ID’s 201-208) had previously tested
positive for COVID-19. Twenty-seven had previously tested negative (sample ID’s 209-235).
Most of the samples were frozen after testing at the original sites and were shipped frozen. Due to
challenges associated with shipping, a few of the samples were never frozen and were shipped and
received refrigerated and at least one sample underwent multiple freeze-thaw cycles. All frozen
samples were thawed directly prior to processing.
Concentrating SARS-CoV-2 from Transport Medium
SARS-CoV-2 (heat-inactivated or infectious, replication-competent) was spiked into Puritan
Universal Transport Medium at various concentrations. Two hundred microliters (1 mg) of
Nanotrap particles in the storage solution were added to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and pulled
out of solution using a DynaMagTM-2 magnet from ThermoFisher (12321D). The supernatant was
removed, and one milliliter of spiked transport medium was added to the particles; a quick mixing
of the sample and the Nanotrap particles was performed using a micropipette. For large volume
samples (5 or 10 mL of spiked transport medium), three hundred microliters (1.5 mg) of Nanotrap
particles were used. Unless otherwise described, samples were incubated with Nanotrap particles
at room temperature for 5 minutes to capture virus. Other than the initial mixing of the sample and
the particles, no mixing was required during the 5-minute incubation. For incubations longer than
5 minutes, samples were inverted once every 5 minutes. Following incubation, Nanotrap particles
were pulled out of solution with the DynaMag-2 magnet and the supernatant was discarded.

Concentrating SARS-CoV-2 from Saliva
Heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was spiked into the saliva at various concentrations. The saliva was
allowed to sit for 3 minutes while aggregates settled. The liquid phase of saliva, which contained
the virus, was moved into a new tube and was diluted in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (one-part
saliva was added to two-parts PBS/Tween). Aliquots of 1.8 mL of diluted saliva were added to
three hundred microliters (1.5 mg) of Nanotrap particles, which previously had been removed from
their storage solution using a DynaMag-2 magnetic rack. Samples were incubated at room
temperature for 10 minutes (at the 5-minute mark, samples were inverted once). Following
incubation, Nanotrap particles were pulled out of solution with a DynaMag-2 magnet and the
supernatant was discarded.
Nucleic Acid Extraction
We evaluated the impact of using Nanotrap particles to capture and concentrate SARS-CoV-2 on
several nucleic acid extraction methods: the QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit from QIAGEN
(52906); the RNeasy® Mini Kit from QIAGEN (74106); a TRIzol LS method used in combination
with the RNeasy Mini Kit; a heat extraction method, which used a short heating step to lyse the
virus; and a heat and detergent method, which used a short heating step and some detergent to lyse
the virus. Those extraction methods are described below in their uses with and without Nanotrap
particles.
When Nanotrap particles were used to capture and concentrate virus prior to nucleic acid
extraction, nucleic acids were extracted under the following conditions. For the QIAamp Viral
RNA Mini Kit, the Nanotrap particle pellet was resuspended in 150 µL of PBS and 560 µL of viral
lysis buffer (Buffer AVL) was added to the re-suspended particles and allowed to incubate for 10
minutes at room temperature. Following this, particles were pulled out of solution using the
DynaMag-2 magnet, and the supernatant was collected and added to 560 µL of ethanol, upon
which the manufacturer’s protocol was followed without any deviations.
For the TRIzol LS method, the Nanotrap particle pellet was resuspended in 100 µL of water, mixed
with 300 µL of TRIzol LS for virus inactivation, and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature.
This was followed by mixing with 200 µL of chloroform, spinning down, collecting the upper
phase, mixing the upper phase with 300 µL of RLT buffer from the RNeasy Mini Kit, and adding
an equal volume of 70% ethanol to the mixture. The next purification steps were followed
according to the manufacturer’s protocol for the RNeasy Mini Kit.
For the direct extraction method, the Nanotrap particle pellet was resuspended in a detergent buffer
and was incubated for 5 minutes at 95°C. For heat only extraction, the Nanotrap particle pellet was
resuspended in 50 µL of water and heated for 10 minutes at 95oC. Following this, the particles
were pulled out of solution using the DynaMag-2 magnet, and the supernatant was collected for
analysis. At the end of each of these methods, the resulting solution, with extracted RNA, was
loaded into the downstream assay.
In samples processed without Nanotrap particles, nucleic acids were extracted under the following
conditions. For the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, nucleic acids were extracted from 150 µL of
sample according to the manufacturers’ protocol.

For the RNeasy Mini Kit, nucleic acids were extracted from 150 µL of sample according to the
manufacturers’ protocol.
For the TRIzol LS method, 100 µL of sample was mixed with 300 µL of TRIzol LS for virus
inactivation. After that samples were mixed with 200 µL of chloroform, spun down, the upper
phase was mixed with 300 µL RLT buffer from the RNeasy Mini Kit, and an equal volume of 70%
ethanol was added. This was followed by loading samples onto the column and RNA was purified
according to the RNeasy Mini Kit recommendations.
For the direct extraction method, 50 µL of sample was heated at 95°C for ten minutes. At the end
of each of these extraction methods, the resulting solution, with extracted RNA, was loaded into
the downstream assay.
Real-Time RT-PCR
For heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 samples, two assays, the Primerdesign Ltd COVID-19 Genesig
Real-Time CE-IVD/EUA PCR assay (Z-COVID-19) and the IDT 2019 nCoV CDC EUA Kit
(1006770), were used for real-time RT-PCR. Per Primerdesign’s instructions, 10 µL of the
OasigTM OneStep 2X qRT-PCR Master Mix, 2 µL of COVID-19 primer/probe, and 8 µL of RNA
template were added to each well. PCR conditions were performed according to Primerdesign’s
instructions on a Roche LightCycler® 96. All samples were run in technical triplicate. Resulting
Ct values were averaged across replicates and standard deviations were calculated.
Per IDT’s recommendation, TaqPathTM 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix from ThermoFisher
(A15300) was used in the IDT 2019 nCoV CDC EUA assay. Per IDT’s instructions, each PCR
reaction used 8.5 µL of nuclease free water, 5 µL of the TaqPath solution, 1.5 µL of the N1
primer/probe, and 5 µL of RNA template. PCR conditions were performed according to IDT’s
instructions on a Roche LightCycler 96. All samples were run in technical triplicate. Resulting Ct
values were averaged across replicates and standard deviations were calculated. All heatinactivated SARS-CoV-2 experiments utilized this assay unless otherwise denoted. All patient
remnant samples utilized this assay.
For infectious, replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 samples, we used the N1 primer from the IDT
2019 nCoV CDC EUA Kit (1006770). For the real-time RT-PCR assay, we used the RNA
UltraSense™ One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System from Applied Biosystems™ (11732927)
according to manufacturer’s recommendation. Each PCR reaction contained 1 µL UltraSense
Enzyme Mix, 5 µL RNA UltraSense 5X Reaction Mix, 1.5 µL of primer/probe mixture from IDT,
0.4 µL ROX Reference Dye, 8.1 µL of nuclease free water, and 5 µL of RNA template. The realtime RT-PCR was performed using an ABI StepOne Plus instrument. All samples were run in
biological triplicate unless otherwise described.

Results
Nanotrap® Particles Capture and Concentrate Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 from Transport
Medium and Saliva
In previous studies, we have shown that hydrogel particles functionalized with high-affinity
chemical baits are able to capture and concentrate from biological samples a variety of respiratory
viruses, including Influenza A and B, RSV, and Coronavirus 229-E 10-13. In light of this, we asked
whether the same particles could capture and concentrate SARS-CoV-2 from transport medium
and saliva in order to improve diagnostic testing for COVID-19.
In all experiments, a simple four-step workflow was used to capture and concentrate the virus
using hydrogel particles made by Ceres Nanosciences (Nanotrap particles). Briefly, viral transport
medium spiked with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was mixed with Nanotrap particles and
incubated at room temperature. The Nanotrap particles and the captured viruses were separated
from the solution using a magnet and the supernatant was removed. The particle pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer, which lysed the virus and released its nucleic acid. The Nanotrap
particles were pelleted a second time with a magnet, and the nucleic acid-containing supernatant
was ready for analysis by real-time RT-PCR (if using a direct nucleic acid extraction method, Fig.
1A) or for further RNA purification (if using a commercial nucleic acid kit extraction method, Fig.
1B).
We started by evaluating the impact that incubation time has on the amount of virus captured from
a transport medium sample. We spiked 1,000,000 copies/mL of heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2
into blank transport medium. Then we de-pooled the sample and mixed 1 mL aliquots with
Nanotrap particles. The particles were allowed to incubate for either 2, 5, 10, or 30 minutes. The
2-minute and 5-minute incubation samples were not agitated during incubation. The 10-minute
and 30-minute samples were inverted once every 5 minutes to keep the sample mixed, with no
additional agitation. A sample without Nanotrap particles was used as a control (the 0-minute
incubation time point in Fig. 2A). After virus capture, the particles and captured virus were
concentrated using a magnet and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended in PBS
and the lysis buffer from the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit and incubated for 10 minutes. Viral
nucleic acids were purified and analyzed using the Primerdesign assay as described in the methods
section. Results in Fig. 2A show that virus capture is fast, as there was no significant difference in
Ct values across the incubation times. Furthermore, capturing and concentrating SARS-CoV-2
from the samples prior to RNA extraction improved Ct values by about 3.
We then asked whether this method could work across a range of viral titers. Heat-inactivated
SARS-CoV-2 was spiked into transport medium at 100 copies/mL; 1,000 copies/mL; 10,000
copies/mL; 100,000 copies/mL; and 1,000,000 copies/mL. One mL aliquots of each viral sample
were processed with Nanotrap particles using a 5-minute capture time, followed by RNA
extraction using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. The same extraction kit also was used to extract
RNA from the samples without Nanotrap particle processing. Viral RNA was then detected using
real-time RT-PCR. Results in Fig. 2B show that capturing and concentrating SARS-CoV-2 prior
to viral extraction improves Ct values across all tested viral titers. In samples containing 1,000
copies/mL of SARS-CoV-2 or more, the Ct improvement in the Nanotrap particle-processed

samples was between 2 and 3. In the sample containing 100 copies/mL, the Nanotrap particles
enabled detection of the virus, whereas in the absence of Nanotrap particle concentration of the
virus, this sample tested negative in the real-time RT-PCR assay.
In recent months, as commercial nucleic acid extraction kits have become supply-chain limited,
there have been pre-publication articles showing that it is possible to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA
from samples without an RNA extraction step 14. As such, we wanted to explore whether our
method could be used to improve the detection of SARS-CoV-2 when used with a direct extraction
method that utilizes heat and detergent. To do so, we spiked transport medium with 100 copies/mL,
1,000 copies/mL, or 10,000 copies/mL of heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2. Samples were processed
with and without Nanotrap particles, using either the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit or the direct
extraction method.
Results in Fig. 2C demonstrate that Nanotrap particles are compatible with both viral extraction
methods across the range of viral titers tested and that Nanotrap particles improve Ct values across
all viral titers. Interestingly, when used with Nanotrap particles, both extraction methods resulted
in similar Ct values for the samples spiked at 100 copies/mL, 1,000 copies/mL, and 10,000
copies/mL. We noted that the direct extraction method without Nanotrap particles resulted in no
detectable virus across the range of viral titers, which could be due to PCR inhibitors in the
transport medium being loaded into the real-time RT-PCR along with the viral nucleic acid 15.
As swab-based sample collection is technique dependent and because there have been supply chain
issues with NP swabs and transport medium, a preprint article indicated that there have been
promising efforts to demonstrate that saliva is a useful sample type for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics
16
. Several groups reportedly have demonstrated that virus is present in saliva samples, and at least
one group has already received an EUA from the FDA for a saliva-based COVID-19 test 17. Thus,
we wanted to examine whether our method could be used to capture and concentrate SARS-CoV2 from saliva samples.
We spiked a pooled saliva sample with varying concentrations of heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2.
We allowed aggregates in the saliva to settle to the bottom of the tube (this process took 2-3
minutes in a 5 mL saliva sample), prior to taking the supernatant and diluting it in a PBS solution
containing a small amount of detergent. We then added Nanotrap particles to one milliliter of the
diluted saliva sample and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature with an inversion to mix
the sample at 5 minutes. Viral extraction was performed using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit
or the direct extraction method and real-time RT-PCR results were compared to samples that had
not undergone Nanotrap particle processing.
The results in Fig. 2D demonstrate that capturing and concentrating SARS-CoV-2 from the diluted
saliva sample improved real-time RT-PCR results by 3-4 Cts at viral titers of 1,000 and 10,000
copies/mL and enabled detection at 50 copies/mL and 100 copies/mL when they were otherwise
undetectable. Furthermore, much like the results with transport media samples, Nanotrap particles
enabled the use of the direct extraction method.

Nanotrap® Particles Capture and Concentrate Infectious SARS-CoV-2
As heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 is not necessarily representative of real-life testing paradigms,
we assessed whether our method was compatible with infectious SARS-CoV-2. The method
described above was followed, except that during the virus capture stage Nanotrap particles were
incubated for 30 minutes with constant agitation. The results in Fig. 3A demonstrate that our
method can capture and concentrate infectious SARS-CoV-2 from transport medium across
multiple virus concentrations and can improve detection of that virus using a real-time RT-PCR
assay.
We next evaluated whether we could use Nanotrap particles with infectious virus and a direct
extraction method. To accomplish this, we spiked infectious SARS-CoV-2 in 1 mL of transport
medium, added Nanotrap particles, and after 30 minutes of constant agitation Nanotrap particles
were pelleted with a magnet. Pelleted Nanotrap particles were either directly treated with lysis
buffer followed by RNA purification on a column; or they were mixed with water and heated for
10 minutes at 95oC to release the RNA directly into the supernatant; or they were mixed with
detergent and heated for 10 minutes at 95oC to release the RNA directly into the supernatant. The
results in Fig. 3B show that the use of Nanotrap particles improves viral RNA recovery for all
tested methods. Moreover, these findings are in agreement with data in Fig. 2C and confirm that
Nanotrap particles can be used for direct SARS CoV-2 RNA purification from transport medium
without the use of RNA purification kits. Interestingly, the yield of the recovered RNA for a heat
and detergent method combined with Nanotrap particles is significantly higher than the Nanotrap
particle method combined with the column-based RNA purification kits.
Nanotrap® Particles Can Eliminate False Negatives by Concentrating SARS-CoV-2 Prior to
Testing
We next asked whether our method would improve detection of SARS-CoV-2 in samples that had
been collected from patients. We obtained two sets of transport medium diagnostic remnant
samples that previously had been tested for SARS-CoV-2. The first set of samples was received
from Discovery Life Sciences and included 9 samples that previously had tested positive and 5
samples that previously had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 using the Abbott RealTime SARSCoV-2 EUA test. A second set of remnant samples was obtained from Hancock Regional Hospital
in Greenwood, IN. Eight samples previously had tested positive while 27 samples previously had
tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 using the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 EUA assay. Each
of these samples was processed with and without Nanotrap particles, followed by nucleic acid
extraction using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit and detection by real-time RT-PCR.
Results in Fig. 4A and Fig. 4B demonstrate that our method is able to detect SARS-CoV-2 in all
17 samples that had previously tested positive. These results also demonstrate that concentrating
virus from transport medium samples prior to RNA extraction significantly improves detection of
SARS-CoV-2 in low viral load diagnostic remnant samples as compared to those same samples
processed without Nanotrap particles, (average improvement in Ct value when using Nanotrap
particles for low viral load samples is 3.1; n = 10). These improvements in Ct value are consistent
with the results we saw with our contrived samples.

Of even greater interest to us were the results that suggest that using Nanotrap particles to
concentrate the virus from the transport medium prior to nucleic acid extraction can identify
potential false negatives. In four of the samples that previously had been reported as negative for
SARS-CoV-2 (Samples 209-2012 in Fig. 4B), we observed Ct values that were indicative of low
levels of virus when we used our method. Note that for Sample 213, Nanotrap particle processing
did not result in detection of SARS-CoV-2 even though SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the sample
without Nanotrap particle processing (i.e. with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit extraction only). This
could be due to sample storage conditions; these samples had been subjected to at least one freezethaw cycle, which may have lysed virus in the transport medium prior to the addition of the
Nanotrap particles. The Nanotrap particles can capture whole virions but cannot capture freefloating nucleic acids, whereas we assume that a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit extraction kit would
capture and purify free-floating viral nucleic acids, regardless of whether those came from
previously lysed or recently lysed viruses. No SARS-CoV-2 was observed in our negative control
(water), indicating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the five previously negative samples is not due
to PCR background.
We also noted that the Nanotrap particles did not consistently improve the Ct values of the high
viral titer samples (see, for example, Samples 101-106 in Fig. 4A). These results suggest that the
Nanotrap particles may become saturated at very high viral titers. This could be addressed by using
a larger amount of Nanotrap particles in sample processing, though that may have implications for
the very low viral titer samples. For immediate testing ramp-up needs, however, this method
appears to be very useful, as getting a very accurate assessment of the viral load is much less
clinically relevant than knowing whether virus is present in a sample.
Nanotrap® Particles Capture and Concentrate SARS-CoV-2 from Large Sample Volumes
The diagnostic industry is racing to increase testing capabilities for COVID-19. Despite the
impressive efforts thus far, we are still far short of the total number of daily tests that public health
experts suggest are necessary 18-20. To address this shortage, the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services has called for the development of new diagnostic tools, including “pooling of
samples from multiple (5, 10, or 20) individuals in a single test” in circumstances where the overall
prevalence of the disease is low 21.
Others have demonstrated that pooling of samples for testing for SARS-CoV-2 can increase test
capacity but that it would introduce a risk of borderline positive samples escaping detection 22.
Therefore, we asked whether Nanotrap particles could capture infectious SARS-CoV-2 from a
large volume of a highly diluted sample, mimicking sample pooling prior to viral extraction,
without sacrificing detection of low viral load samples. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 was spiked into
1 mL of transport medium at 100 pfu/mL. One hundred microliters of diluted virus were used for
RNA extraction and purification with RNeasy kit. The rest of the diluted virus was mixed with 4
or 9 mL of uninfected transport medium. Nanotrap particles were incubated with the samples for
thirty minutes with constant agitation to capture the virus and viral extraction was achieved using
direct extraction method. Viral detection was performed using real-time RT-PCR. Results in Fig.
5A indicate that Nanotrap particle processing dramatically improves Ct values in the diluted
samples (by 5-6 Ct values) compared to the sample that was not processed with Nanotrap particles.
Furthermore, the difference of about 1 Ct value between the 5 mL and 10 mL samples that

underwent Nanotrap particle processing is consistent with the notion that two times as much virus
had been spiked into the 10 mL sample.
To determine whether our method would work for a larger sample volume with a more realistic
diagnostic sample, we diluted 100 µL of diagnostic remnant Sample 105 into uninfected transport
medium at 1:50 and 1:100 dilutions (5 mL and 10 mL total volume); each diluted sample contained
the same total amount of virus. We then added Nanotrap particles to the sample and allowed them
to incubate for five minutes with no agitation. Viral extraction was performed using the QIAamp
Viral RNA Mini Kit. The 5 mL and 10 mL samples were also processed without Nanotrap particles
to serve as controls. The results in Fig. 5B show that using Nanotrap particles to capture and
concentrate SARS-CoV-2 from 5 mL and 10 mL transport medium samples significantly improves
detection of the virus. Interestingly, the Nanotrap particles were able to recover roughly the same
amount of virus in both the 5 mL and 10 mL dilutions, suggesting that the full amount of virus was
recovered in both samples, and that even larger sample volumes could be processed using the same
method. Collectively, these data indicate that our method could enable much better detection of
SARS-CoV-2 in samples that have been pooled prior to RNA extraction. This suggests a path
toward testing large numbers of patient pooled samples for presence of SARS-CoV-2 while
reducing the reagents and labor needed to perform the nucleic acid extraction and detection steps.

Discussion
The simple method we have developed can take as little as 10 minutes to prepare SARS-CoV-2
RNA for downstream testing and obviates the need for commercial nucleic acid extraction kits.
Using contrived samples with heat-inactivated and infectious SARS-CoV-2, we have
demonstrated significant improvements in Ct values from transport medium and saliva samples
with both commercial nucleic acid extraction kits and a direct extraction method.
Contrived samples lack the biological complexity (i.e. cells, cell debris, bacteria) contained in
patient samples. Using 49 diagnostic remnant samples, we demonstrated that our method can
improve detection of SARS-CoV-2 in real samples and eliminate false negatives. Our method had
100% concordance with all of the samples that previously tested positive, improved the real-time
RT-PCR signal by an average of 3.1 Ct values in the low viral load samples, and identified SARSCoV-2 in four of the samples that had previously tested negative.
The national and international targets for numbers of daily tests are astronomical. There is a
growing consensus that pooling of samples is going to be one of the methods that must be
implemented in order to reach those numbers of daily tests, an opinion which is shared by the
government of the United States 22,23. Our method was able to concentrate infectious SARS-CoV2 from contrived samples and SARS-CoV-2 from diagnostic remnant samples in pooled patient
sample mimics, an approach which is a promising way forward to address the massive testing
scale-ups that are necessary.
There are several limitations to this study. First, we only had fourteen diagnostic remnant samples
that had been previously tested on the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA assay, and only five
of those samples had previously tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. A larger set of samples would
help us assess how our method compares to that assay. Second, for all of the diagnostic remnant
samples that we used, the storage conditions were inconsistent. Some samples were unintentionally
subjected to multiple freeze-thaw cycles, others were only subjected to one free-thaw cycle, and
others were shipped and stored at 4℃ and never frozen. Third, it is important to note that we used
a different detection assay (from IDT) than had been used previously on the diagnostic remnant
samples; therefore, we cannot make any direct conclusions regarding whether Nanotrap particles
would improve the performance of those assays. Additionally, our saliva data is limited to
contrived samples and it is therefore difficult to gauge how effective our method would be for
saliva SARS-CoV-2 testing in a clinical setting.
Despite these limitations, we are confident that the method described here can offer increased
sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing from transport medium and saliva while enabling
the use of faster and easier nucleic acid extraction methods, which will help address supply chain
limitations. Also, as we have previously demonstrated that the Nanotrap particles used in this study
can also capture and concentrate influenza viruses, RSV, and other coronaviruses 13, we are
confident that the method described here will be compatible with the respiratory virus panel tests
that are under development. Moreover, while we did not address assays for viral antigens, next
generation sequencing assays, or antibody assays in this work, Nanotrap particles can be used to
improve those testing modalities 10,11,24-26 and we look forward to expanding our work into that
area.

Figure 1: Nanotrap particles are compatible with multiple extraction methods. Sample is
mixed with Nanotrap particles and incubated for 2-10 minutes. Nanotrap particles are pelleted with
a magnet, the supernatant is removed, and the particle pellet is resuspended in a viral lysis solution.
The Nanotrap particles are pelleted with a magnet, and (A) the supernatant can be used directly in
real-time RT-PCR (total workflow time is 10-20 minutes) or (B) the supernatant can be processed
with a commercial RNA extraction kit prior to viral detection (total workflow time is 30-50
minutes.)
Figure 2: Nanotrap particles rapidly capture heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in multiple
sample matrices and improve detection by real-time RT-PCR. A) Heat-inactivated SARSCoV-2 was spiked into transport medium at 1,000,000 copies/mL. One milliliter samples were
added to Nanotrap particles and incubated for 2, 5, 10, or 30 minutes. Virus was extracted using
Qiagen’s QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, and real-time RT-PCR was performed using Primerdesign
Ltd’s COVID-19 Genesig Real-Time CE-IVD/EUA PCR assay. A sample without Nanotrap
particle processing was used to represent a 0-minute incubation with Nanotrap particles. B) Heat
inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was spiked into viral transport medium at 100; 1,000; 10,000; 100,000;
or 1,000,000 copies/mL. One milliliter samples at each viral titer were added to Nanotrap particles
and incubated for 5 minutes. Virus was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit and realtime RT-PCR was performed using IDT’s 2019 nCoV CDC EUA assay. Samples at each titer
without Nanotrap particles were used as controls. C) Heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was spiked
into transport medium at 100; 1,000; or 10,000 copies/mL. One milliliter samples at each viral titer
were added to Nanotrap particles and incubated for 5 minutes. Virus was extracted using either the
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit or heat and detergent extraction. Viral detection was performed by
real-time RT-PCR using the IDT 2019 nCoV CDC EUA assay. Samples without Nanotrap
particles were processed by each extraction method as controls. D) Heat-inactivated SARS-CoV2 was spiked into saliva at 50; 100; 1,000; or 10,000 copies/mL. Saliva aggregates were allowed
to settle to the bottom of the tube for 3 minutes. The liquid saliva at each viral titer was then
withdrawn, diluted as 1 volume saliva plus 2 volumes in PBS/Tween, and 1.8 mL of each dilution
was added to Nanotrap particles. After an incubation of 10 minutes, the virus was extracted from
the Nanotrap particles using either QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit or heat and detergent extraction.
Viral detection was performed by real-time RT-PCR using the IDT 2019 nCoV CDC EUA assay.
Samples without Nanotrap particles were processed by each extraction method as controls.

to Nanotrap particles and incubated for 5 minutes. Viral extraction was performed using the
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit and viral RNA was detected using real-time RT-PCR. Samples 101109 and Samples 201-208 had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the Abbott and
Cepheid assays, respectively. Samples 110-114 and Samples 210-235 had previously tested
negative. Each diagnostic remnant sample also underwent processing without Nanotrap particles
for equivalency with previous results. An uninfected transport medium sample was used as a
negative control.
