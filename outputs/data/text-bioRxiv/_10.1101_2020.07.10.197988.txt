Abstract

2

While vaccine development will hopefully quell the global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by

3

SARS-CoV-2, small molecule drugs that can effectively control SARS-CoV-2 infection are

4

urgently needed. Here, inhibitors of spike (S) mediated cell entry were identified in a high

5

throughput screen of an approved drugs library with SARS-S and MERS-S pseudotyped particle
le

6

entry assays. We discovered six compounds (cepharanthine, abemaciclib, osimertinib,

7

trimipramine, colforsin, and ingenol) to be broad spectrum inhibitors for spike-mediated entry.

8

This work should contribute to the development of effective treatments against the initial stage of

9

viral infection, thus reducing viral burden in COVID-19 patients.

Introduction
Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sensed RNA viruses. While some

3

coronaviruses cause the common cold, others are highly pathogenic and have led to several

4

outbreaks in recent years [1]. In 2003, the coronavirus strain SARS-CoV caused severe acute

5

respiratory syndrome outbreak in Asia [2]. In 2013, the Middle East respiratory syndrome

6

(MERS) emerged with similar clinical symptoms as SARS, and the causative agent was named

7

MERS-CoV [3]. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in December

8

2019, and is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which was named based on sequence similarities to

9

SARS-CoV [4]. While many clinical trials are actively under way for treatment of COVID-19,

10

only remdesivir has gained emergency use authorization from the United States Food and Drug

11

Administration. However, it is already clear that this drug alone is not enough to combat the

12

COVID-19 pandemic [5]. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need to identify additional drugs

13

with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity to ameliorate disease in hundreds of millions of yet infectible

14

individuals.

15

SARS-CoV-2 is a biological safety level 3 (BSL-3) pathogen. Currently, most facilities

16

for high-throughput screening (HTS) are only BSL-2, and few BSL-3 facilities have some HTS

17

capabilities. Several drug repurposing screens for SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, but the

18

throughput and assay type were limited due to biocontainment requirements. Therefore, the

19

development of BSL-2 compatible SARS-CoV-2 compound screening assays is an alternative

20

and more facile approach for HTS and drug development. Viral entry assays utilizing

21

pseudotyped particles (PP) are one type of cell-based BSL-2 viral assays that could be utilized

22

for this purpose. PP contain viral envelope proteins, but carry a reporter gene instead of the viral

23

genome, and thus display the necessary viral coat proteins for host receptor and membrane

24

interactions without the capacity for replication. These BSL-2 viral entry assays have been

25

successfully applied to HTS campaigns for several viruses such as Ebola virus [6], influenza [7],

26

and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [8].

27

For SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the spike proteins (S) are responsible for host receptor

28

binding and priming by host proteases to trigger membrane fusion. Thus, SARS-CoV and

29

MERS-CoV spike proteins were pseudotyped with murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag-pol

30

polyprotein to form SARS-S and MERS-S PP carrying luciferase reporter RNA [9,10]. The PP

entry assays include inoculation of susceptible cells with SARS-S or MERS-S PP, incubation to

2

allow luciferase reporter gene expression, and measurement of luciferase reporter activity. These
se

3

protocols were successfully optimized and miniaturized in 1536-well plate formats suitable for

4

HTS. Here, we report parallel drug repurposing screens using SARS-S and MERS-S PP entry

5

assays to identify a set of broad-spectrum coronavirus entry inhibitors. SARS-CoV-2 live virus

6

cytopathic effect (CPE) assay was used to test the generality of these coronavirus entry

7

inhibitors, confirming inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry.

Results
Optimization and miniaturization of SARS-S and MERS-S PP entry assays
Both SARS-S and MERS-S PP were generated by a three plasmid co-transfection to yield
ld

12

particles containing capsid protein of murine leukemia virus (MLV), spike protein (SARS-S or

13

MERS-S), and luciferase RNA (Fig. 1a). The original entry assays were developed in 24-well

14

plates in which host cells were inoculated with PP. Upon cell entry, the particle releases the

15

luciferase RNA reporter for subsequent expression of the luciferase enzyme (Fig. 1b) [9,10].

RNAs, which together assemble into pseudotyped particles. (b) Comparison of SARS/MERS-CoV and

occurs, RNAs of pseudotyped particles are released into cell, where they are reverse transcribed into
DNAs, integrated into the genome, and express luciferase reporter enzyme. Illustrations were made
with BioRender.

To optimize these assays for miniaturization into 1536-well plates, we first tested the

3

SARS-S and MERS-S PP entry in three cell lines: Vero E6, Huh7, and Calu-3. We found that

4

Vero E6 cells produced the highest luciferase signal for SARS-S PP assay and that Huh7 cells

5

yielded the highest signal for MERS-S (Fig. 2a). Vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein

6

(VSV-G) is a class III fusion protein that constitutes the sole fusogenic protein, and does not

7

require protease priming [11]. Thus, VSV-G PP was used as a positive control and produced

8

high signals for all three cell lines (Fig. 2a). This cell tropism data agrees with previous reports

9

[10,12]. Based on these results, the Vero E6 cell line and Huh7 cell line were chosen for SARS-S

10

and MERS-S PP entry assays, respectively. A time course experiment showed that higher signal-

11

to-basal (S/B) ratio was achieved with 48 h PP incubation with all glycoprotein-containing PP

12

compared with control PP formed by two plasmid transfection lacking envelope glycoproteins

13

that are responsible for membrane fusion (delEnv) (Fig. 2b). Therefore, the 48 h time point was

14

used for all following experiments.

15

We examined the percentage of cells transduced with luciferase RNA by PP entry using

16

immunofluorescence staining of luciferase protein and found that in Vero E6 cells, SARS-S PP

17

and VSV-G PP produced1.6% and 6.5% luciferase positive cells, respectively (Fig. 2c). In Huh7

18

cells, MERS-S PP and VSV-G pp transduction produced 10.9% and 26.8% luciferase positive

19

cells, respectively (Fig. 2c). In all cells, the negative control delEnv PP and no PP conditions

20

produced negligible luciferase staining. The percentage of luciferase positive cells correlated

21

with luciferase enzyme activity when comparing different PP in the same cell line. However, cell

22

line comparisons did not show correlation between each PP, which may in part reflect

23

differences in the amount of luciferase expression per cell. The ultrastructure of SARS-S and

24

MERS-S PP were examined by negative stain electron microscopy (EM) to ensure that they

25

showed the expected morphology. EM analysis revealed regularly sized, 125-200 nm diameter

26

spherical structures, that were often partially or completely covered with a dense array of fine

filamentous or lollipop shaped projections, consistent with expected appearance of spike

glycoproteins (Fig. 2d). The presence of SARS-S on the surface of SARS-S PP was further

3

confirmed by immunogold labeling (Fig. 2d). MERS-S PP displayed a conspicuous dense coat of

4

spike-like structures, but lack of a primary antibody has thus far precluded confirmation of their

5

identity with immunogold labeling.

spike-like projections. Scale bar = 100 nm. (e) PP entry assay was miniaturized to 1536-well format
and performance of SARS-S, MERS-S, delEnv and VSV-G PP in Vero E6, Huh7 and Calu-3 cells are

Both SARS-S and MERS-S PP entry assays were then miniaturized into 1536-well plate

3

format. The cell tropism pattern in the 1536-well format matched what was seen in the 96-well

4

format (Fig. 2e). For SARS-S PP, the best assay performance was seen in Vero E6 cells

5

compared with delEnv PP, with S/B of 182.3, coefficient of variation (CV) of 24.1%, and a Z’

6

factor of 0.26. For MERS-S PP the best assay performance was seen in Huh7 cells, with an S/B

7

of 5325.8, CV of 10.9, and Z’ factor of 0.67. Therefore, the SARS-S PP entry assay in Vero E6

8

cells, and MERS-S PP entry assay in Huh7 cells, were robust and advanced to HTS.

SARS-S and MERS-S entry inhibitor drug repurposing screens

11

The NCATS pharmaceutical collection (NPC) of 2,678 compounds, representing

12

approved or investigational drugs [13], was used for drug repurposing screens of both SARS-S

13

and MERS-S PP entry assays. The primary screens were carried out at four compound

14

concentrations (0.46, 2.3, 11.5, and 57.5 μM). Compound cytotoxicity as determined by an ATP

15

content assay was counter screened in both Vero E6 and Huh7 cell lines, at the same

16

concentrations (Fig. 3). All primary screening datasets were deposited to PubChem (Table 1).

The criteria to select hits for follow-up experiments include compounds in curve classes 1 and 2

with efficacy > 50% in the PP entry assay, and little to no cell killing effect in the cytotoxicity

assays using Vero E6 or Huh7 cells. Sixty-one and sixty-five compounds were identified as hits

4

from SARS-S and MERS-S PP viral entry assays, respectively. After removing 20 overlapping

5

hits, a total of 106 primary hits (4.0% hit rate) were selected for activity confirmation and

follow-up studies.

Hit confirmation and follow up assays

3

In our secondary assays, we retested the 106 cherry-picked hits in the original SARS-S

4

and MERS-S PP entry assays, along with ATP content cytotoxicity assays at 11 concentrations

5

with 1:3 titration. PP entry assays rely on luciferase RNA reporter expression, a process which

6

involves the reverse transcription of luciferase RNA, integration into host genome, and

7

expression. Indeed, some of the confirmed hits had known mechanisms of action against reverse

8

transcriptase (adefovir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), and integrase (elvitegravir and

9

dolutegravir). Therefore, another counter assay, VSV-G PP entry assay, was tested in both Vero

10

E6 and Huh7 cell lines against the 106 hits. In addition to eliminating false positives that inhibit

11

luciferase expression, this assay identified compounds that specifically blocked spike

12

glycoprotein-mediated PP entry. All datasets for secondary assays are publicly available on

13

PubChem (Table 1).

These follow up assays yielded a set of 7 inhibitors that showed greater than 10-fold

2

selectivity to either SARS-S or MERS-S PP entry assays compared with the VSV-G PP entry

3

assays, and a safety index greater than 10 fold (CC50/EC50) (Fig. 4a, b, Table 2). Of these 7

4

compounds, only cepharanthine was active against both SARS-S and MERS-S with greater than

5

10-fold selectivity. While trimipramine, copansilib, abemaciclib and osimertinib showed some

6

level of selectivity towards either SARS-S or MERS-S entry versus VSV-G entry, they only

7

reached 10-fold selectivity in one of the spike PP entry assays. Ingenol and NKH477 were only

8

active in SARS-S PP entry in Vero E6, and not in MERS-S entry in Huh7 cells.

9

These 7 confirmed entry inhibitors were then tested in SARS-S, MERS-S and VSV-G PP

10

entry assays in Calu-3 cells (Fig. 4c). While most entry inhibitors failed to show selectivity

11

towards spike-mediated entry in Calu-3 cells, abemaciclib did show >10-fold selectivity towards

12

both SARS-S and MERS-S based entry compared with VSV-G.

SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay to identify broad acting coronavirus entry inhibitors

3

To test whether the confirmed SARS-S and MERS-S mediated PP entry inhibitors are

4

active against SARS-CoV-2, we further tested the top 7 compounds in a SARS-CoV-2

5

cytopathic effect (CPE) assay [14]. We found that 6 out of 7 entry inhibitors significantly

6

reduced (>30%) CPE caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 5, Table 2).

7

Cepharathine was found to be active against SARS-S in Vero E6 and MERS-S in Huh7 cells,

8

and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 CPE to near full efficacy with bell-shaped concentration response

due to cytotoxicity (Fig. 5b). Five other compounds, trimipramine, ingenol, abemaciclib,

10

osimertinib and NKH447 also protected against SARS-CoV-2 induced CPE, but to lesser

degrees than cepharanthine (Fig. 5).

Discussion

14

Viruses rely on host cells for replication, and cell entry is the first step of the viral

15

infection life cycle, and a prime target for drug intervention. Both broad-spectrum and pathogen-

16

specific inhibitors of viral entry have been proposed for emerging viruses such as Ebola virus

17

and coronaviruses [15,16]. Proven therapeutics for viral entry include several approved drugs

targeting CCR5, the host co-receptor for HIV [17]. In SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,

2

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been recognized as a high affinity binding receptor

3

for the viral spike glycoprotein, while dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) is the receptor for MERS-

4

CoV [18,19]. Following receptor binding, membrane fusion is mediated by spike protein

5

cleavage by host cell proteases. TMPRSS2 protease has been shown to be the predominant

6

protease in Calu-3 cells, which mediates ACE2-dependent direct membrane fusion that does not

7

involve the endocytic pathway [12]. Alternate entry pathways are used in cell lines such as Vero

8

E6 and Huh7 that involve endocytosis of viral particles and cathepsin protease priming for

9

membrane fusion [18]. Here, we have applied phenotypic SARS-S and MERS-S PP entry assays

10

for drug repurposing screens with the potential of identifying viral entry inhibitors with different

11

mechanisms of action.

12

In this study, we identified 7 coronavirus spike-mediated entry inhibitors out of a library

13

of 2,678 approved drugs (Fig. 4). After further testing in a SARS-CoV-2 live virus CPE assay

14

and removing cytotoxic compounds, we found that 6 out of 7 entry inhibitors were able to rescue

15

the CPE of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 5), indicating the utility of these PP entry assays.

16

Although the exact mechanism for entry inhibition is unclear, these six compounds, inhibited

17

SARS-S and MERS-S PP cell entry with greater potency than VSV-G PP cell entry (Fig. 4),

18

indicating their coronavirus-specific inhibitory activities on viral entry into host cells. Of these

19

six, only cepharanthine and abemaciclib have been reported to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects,

20

while the other compounds are novel [20]. We found that cepharanthine is an inhibitor of spike-

21

mediated cell entry and rescued the CPE of SARS-CoV-2 to full efficacy. This was corroborated

22

by a recent study, which found that cepharanthine was able to block SARS-CoV-2 induced CPE

23

in Vero E6 cells, only when added during the viral entry time period, and not the post-entry

24

period [21]. Cepharanthine is a natural product used in Japan since the 1950s for treatments of

25

several diseases without major side effects [22]. It has polypharmacology, with anti-

26

inflammatory activity linked to AMPK activation and NFκB inhibition [22]. Cepharanthine has

27

previously reported antiviral activities against HIV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, human T-

28

lymphotropic virus (HTLV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) [23].

29
30

We also identified two other approved drugs, abemaciclib and osimertinib as entry
inhibitors that showed greater than 50% rescue of the SARS-CoV-2 CPE (Fig.s 4 and 5).

Interestingly, abemaciclib also showed spike-specific PP entry inhibition in Calu3 cells over

2

VSV-G mediated PP entry (Fig. 4c). Abemaciclib is a CDK4/6 inhibitor that is approved by the

3

FDA for breast cancer treatment [24,25]. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) are a group of serine-

4

threonine kinases that regulate the cell cycle, and have been targeted for anticancer drug

5

development. Additionally, antiviral activities of CDK inhibitors have been reported against

6

HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), HBV and Zika virus [26]. The antiviral mechanism of action

7

for CDK inhibitors works mainly through the suppression of viral genome replication in host

8

cells [26]. Our data suggests that abemaciclib inhibits CPE of coronaviruses by blocking cell

9

entry in Vero E6, Huh7 and Calu-3 cells. Therefore, the structure of this compound may have the

10

potential to be optimized as a more potent SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor. Osimertinib is an

11

inhibitor of T790M mutant of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and is approved by the

12

FDA for treatment of patients with metastatic mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer [27].

13

Osimertinib does not have previous reported antiviral activities. We found it to rescue the SARS-

14

CoV-2 CPE to 60% efficacy, albeit with a narrow therapeutic window due to cytotoxicity (Fig.

15

5f).

16

Three other inhibitors of spike-mediated PP entry were found to rescue SARS-CoV-2

17

CPE to less than 50% efficacy: trimipramine, ingenol, and NKH477 (Fig. 5a, c, g). Trimipramine

18

is an oral tricyclic antidepressant. Chemically, trimipramine is a basic amine compound

19

belonging to cationic amphiphilic drugs. The antiviral activity of trimipramine has been reported

20

to block the viral entry for Ebola virus and influenza [28,29]. Due to its chemical property,

21

trimipramine as a basic amine can accumulate in acidic organelles such as the late endosomes

22

and lysosomes in cells. High concentration of basic amine drugs in late endosomes and

23

lysosomes may block viral genome release into cytosol [28,29]. However, for coronaviruses, this

24

effect might be more prominent in cell lines such as Vero E6 and Huh7, but not in Calu-3 cells,

25

which has endocytosis independent entry [18]. In accordance with this, trimipramine’s entry

26

inhibition activity was not confirmed in Calu-3 cells (Fig. 4). Importantly, the antiviral entry

27

activity of trimipramine has not yet been reported. In addition, clomipramine, a close analog of

28

trimipramine, was also reported to protect against SARS-CoV-2 CPE through inhibition of

29

autophagy [14]. In the current study, clomipramine was found to be active against SARS-S PP

30

entry and non-cytotoxic in the primary screen, but was not selected for further follow-up because

31

its potency was below the threshold criteria. Ingenol mebutate is a cell death inducer approved

1

by the FDA for topical treatment of actinic keratosis [30]. Due to its topical delivery route and

2

mechanisms of action, ingenol is unlikely to be useful for treatment of COVID-19. NKH477,

3

also called colforsin, is a derivative of forskolin and a potent activator of adenylate cyclase [31].

4

It is approved in Japan for multiple indications and does not have reports of direct antiviral

5

activities.

6

A number of drug repurposing and computer-aided virtual screens have been reported for

7

SARS-CoV-2. It is a common phenomenon that the potencies identified in drug repurposing are

8

not high enough to be clinically relevant when compared to the human plasma concentrations

9

achievable at approved dosing regimens [32]. Drug combination therapy has been proposed as a

10

practical and useful approach for drug repurposing to treat emerging infectious diseases, as drug

11

synergy may reduce the individual drug concentrations in the combinations. The synergistic

12

effect of two- or three- drug combination therapy can increase the therapeutic effect, reduce the

13

doses of individual drugs, and thus reduce potential adverse effects [32]. Ohashi H et al. has

14

reported that the combination of cepharanthine (entry inhibitor) and nelfinavir (HIV protease

15

inhibitor) enhanced the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity [21]. We believe that these coronavirus

16

specific viral entry inhibitors may have utility in a drug combination therapy with other anti-

17

SARS-CoV-2 drugs that have different mechanisms of action, such as remdesivir (the viral RNA

18

dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor), or lysomotropic autophagy inhibitors. In addition,

19

considering that there have been three different coronavirus outbreaks in the past 20 years, these

20

broad acting inhibitors of spike-mediated cell entry might also have utility in drug development

21

efforts for possible future outbreaks.

The NCATS pharmaceutical collection (NPC) was assembled internally, and contains

2

2,678 compounds, which include drugs approved by US FDA and foreign health agencies in

3

European Union, United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, and Australia, as well as some clinical trialed

4

experimental drugs [13]. The compounds were dissolved in 10 mM DMSO as stock solutions,

5

and titrated at 1:5 for primary screens with 4 concentrations, and at 1:3 for follow up assays with

6

11 concentrations. The SARS-S PP entry assay in Vero E6 cells, and MERS-S PP entry assay in

7

Huh7 cells, were used to screen the NPC library in parallel. Concurrently, counter screens for

8

cytotoxicity of compounds in Vero E6 and Huh7 were also screened against the NPC library.

9

A customized software developed in house at NCATS [33] was used for analyzing the

10

primary screen data. Half-maximal efficacious concentration (EC50) and half-maximal

11

cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) of compounds were calculated using Prism software

12

(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Results in bar plots were expressed as mean of triplicates

13

± standard error of the mean (SEM).

Luciferase immunofluorescence and high-content imaging

16

Cells were seeded at 15,000 cells in 100 µL/well media in 96-well assay plates, and

17

incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 overnight (~16 h). Supernatant was removed, and 50 µL/well of PP

18

was added. Plates were spin-inoculated at 1500 rpm (453 xg) for 45 min, incubated for 2 h at

19

37°C, 5% CO2, then 50 μL/well of growth media was added. The plates were incubated for

20

48h at 37°C, 5% CO2. Media was aspirated, and cells were washed once with 1X PBS

21

(ThermoFisher). Cells were then fixed in 4% PFA (EMS) in PBS containing 0.1% BSA

22

(ThermoFisher) for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with 1X PBS,

23

then blocked and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X 100 (ThermoFisher) in Cell Staining Buffer

24

(Biolegend) for 30 min. Permeabilization/blocking solution was removed, 1:1000 primary

25

mouse-anti-luciferase antibody (Santa Cruz) was added, and incubated overnight at 4 °C.

26

Primary antibody was aspirated and cells were washed three times with 1X PBS. 1:1000

27

secondary antibody goat-anti-mouse-AlexaFluor 647 (ThermoFisher) was added for 1 h in Cell

28

Staining Buffer. Cells were washed three times, and stained with 1:5000 Hoechst 33342

29

(ThermoFisher) and 1:10000 HCS Cell Mask Green (ThermoFisher) for 30 min, before three

30

final 1X PBS washes. Plates were sealed and stored at 4 °C prior to imaging.

Plates were imaged on the IN Cell 2500 HS automated high-content imaging system. A

2

20x air objective was used to capture nine fields per well in each 96 well plate. Cells were

3

imaged with the DAPI, Green, and FarRed channels. Images were uploaded to the Columbus

Analyzer software for automated high-content analysis. Cells were first identified using the

5

Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain in the DAPI channel. Cell bodies were identified using the HCS

6

Cell Mask stain in the green channel using the initial population of Nuclei region of interests.

7

Intensity of the FarRed channel indicating luciferase expression was measured, and a threshold

Negative stain and immunogold electron microscopy

13

All reagents were obtained from Electron Microscopy Sciences, unless otherwise

14

specified. For negative staining without immunogold labeling, freshly glow-discharged, formvar

15

and carbon coated, 300-mesh copper grids were inverted on 5 µl drops of sample on Parafilm for

16

1 min. Grids with adhered sample were transferred across two drops of syringe-filtered PBS, and

17

then two drops of filtered distilled water before being placed on a drop of 1% aqueous uranyl

18

acetate for 1 min, after which grids were blotted with filter paper, allowing a thin layer of uranyl

19

acetate to dry on the grid.

SARS-S PP to be immunogold labeled were adhered to freshly glow discharged, formvar

21

and carbon coated, 300-mesh gold grids, transferred across three drops of filtered PBS and then

22

incubated on drops of filtered blocking solution containing 2% BSA (Sigma) in PBS for 10 min.

23

Samples were covered during the incubation steps to prevent evaporation. Primary antibody to

24

SARS-S (BEI), was diluted 1:20 in filtered blocking solution. After blocking, grids were blotted

SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect (CPE) assay
SARS-CoV-2 CPE assay was conducted at Southern Research Institute (Birmingham,

7

AL). Briefly, compounds were titrated in DMSO and acoustically dispensed into 384-well assay

8

plates at 60 nL/well. Cell culture media (MEM, 1% Pen/Strep/GlutaMax, 1% HEPES, 2% HI

9

FBS) was dispensed at 5 µL/well into assay plates and incubated at room temperature. Vero E6

10

(selected for high ACE2 expression) was inoculated with SARS CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020) at

11

0.002 M.O.I. in media and quickly dispensed into assay plates as 4000 cells in 25 µL/well. Assay

12

plates were incubated for 72 h at 37°C, 5% CO2, 90% humidity. Then, 30 µL/well of CellTiter-

13

Glo (Promega) was dispensed, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and luminescence
