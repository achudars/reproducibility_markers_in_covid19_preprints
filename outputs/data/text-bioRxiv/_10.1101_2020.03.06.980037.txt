Abstract

2

The emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, at the end of 2019 has resulted in

3

widespread human infections across the globe. While genetically distinct from SARS-

4

CoV, the etiological agent that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome

5

(SARS) in 2003, both coronaviruses exhibit receptor binding domain (RBD) conservation

6

and utilize the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for

7

virus entry. Therefore, it will be important to test the cross-reactivity of antibodies that

8

have been previously generated against the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV

9

in order to aid research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that an

10

immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV S is highly conserved in multiple

11

strains of SARS-CoV-2. Consistently, four murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised

12

against this immunogenic SARS-CoV fragment were able to recognise the S protein of

13

SARS-CoV-2 expressed in a mammalian cell line. Importantly, one of them (mAb 1A9)

14

was demonstrated to detect S in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. To our knowledge, this is

15

the first study showing that mAbs targeting the S2 domain of SARS-CoV can cross-react

16

with SARS-CoV-2 and this observation is consistent with the high sequence conservation

17

in the S2 subunit. These cross-reactive mAbs may serve as tools useful for SARS-CoV-2

18

research as well as for the development of diagnostic assays for its associated coronavirus

19

disease COVID-19.

Introduction

24

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiological

25

agent for the infectious disease, SARS, which first emerged 17 years ago [1,2]. In

26

December of 2019, another novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) appeared to have crossed

27

species barriers to infect humans and was effectively transmitted from person to person,

28

leading to a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China [3-5]. As of 1 March 2020, this

29

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread further within China and worldwide to 60

30

countries with over 87,000 confirmed cases and 2,980 fatalities [6]. The outbreak has

31

been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health

32

Organization (WHO) and poses an increasing burden on global health and economy [6].

33

A study of 56 complete and partial SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from COVID-19

34

patients showed very high sequence conservation of more than 99%, indicating a recent

35

introduction of the virus into the human population [7]. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-

36

CoV-2 revealed that like SARS-CoV and bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-

37

CoVs), it belongs to lineage B of the betacoronavirus genus [8,9]. While SARS-CoV-2

38

shares higher whole-genome sequence identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-

39

CoVZXC21 (88 – 89%) than with SARS-CoV (79 – 82%), the receptor binding domain

40

(RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV RBD, suggesting a possible

41

common host cell receptor [8,9]. In line with this, several groups have demonstrated that

42

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the same host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),

43

as SARS-CoV for viral entry [3,10-12]. Due to its role in virus entry, the viral surface

44

spike (S) glycoprotein has been the target for the generation of monoclonal antibodies

45

(mAb). The S protein is functionally divided into two domains with the RBD-containing

46

S1 subunit being responsible for attachment to host cell while the S2 subunit mediates

47

fusion between viral and host membranes (reviewed by Li, F.) [13]. Although the origin

48

of SARS-CoV-2 has not been established, SARS-CoV is believed to have originated from

49

SL-CoVs residing in bats [14-17]. For the majority of SL-CoVs, the S1 subunit has low

50

sequence homology to that of SARS-CoV which indicates species-dependent receptor

51

binding [17,18]. On the other hand, the high amino acid sequence identity of more than

52

90% in the S2 subunit suggests that the fusion mechanism during virus infection is well-

53

conserved [17,18].

54

In our previous work, we used an immunogenic fragment in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV

55

to generate a panel of murine mAbs [19]. One of them, mAb 1A9, which binds to the S

56

protein through a novel epitope within the S2 subunit at amino acids 1111-1130, has the

57

ability to bind and cross-neutralize pseudotyped viruses expressing S of human SARS-

58

CoV, civet SARS-CoV and bat SL-CoV strains [20]. In this study, we show that the

59

sequence of the immunogen used to generate mAb 1A9, as well as three other mAbs, is

60

conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2 and these mAbs bind to the spike protein

61

of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in a mammalian cell line. Importantly, mAb 1A9 was

62

demonstrated to detect S in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.

69

penicillin-streptomycin solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were maintained at

70

37 °C with 5% CO2.

71

Purification of antibody

72

The hybridoma for mAb 1A9 was previously generated [19]. All mAbs were purified

73

from cell culture supernatant using a HiTrap protein G HP affinity column (GE

74

Healthcare) and stored at -80 °C. The purity of the mAb was confirmed by sodium

75

dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic (SDS-PAGE) analysis. The

76

concentration of the purified mAb was determined using the Coomassie Plus protein

77

assay reagent (Thermo Scientific).

78

Transient transfection and western blot analysis

79

COS-7 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates 24 hours prior to the transient transfection

80

using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s

81

protocol. SARS-CoV-2 S-expressing plasmids were codon-optimized and generated by

82

gene synthesis (Bio Basic Asia Pacific) according to GenBank accession QHD43416.1.

83

One plasmid is for expressing full-length S while the other is for expressing a fragment

84

consisting of residues 1048-1206. At 48 hours post-transfection, cells were harvested,

85

spun down by centrifugation and washed with cold PBS twice. Cells were then

86

resuspended in RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 0.5%

87

deoxycholic acid, 0.005% SDS and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride] and subjected

88

to five freeze-thaw cycles. Clarified supernatant containing the protein of interest was

89

obtained by spinning down the cell lysate at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C to remove the cell debris

membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked in 5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered

93

saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 hour at room temperature and incubated with

94

primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. After the membrane was washed with TBST, it was

95

incubated with a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific) at room

96

temperature for 1 hour. The membrane was then washed with TBST again and detected

97

with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Scientific).

Transient transfection and immunofluorescence analysis

99

For immunofluorescence (IF) analysis, COS-7 cells on glass coverslips were transfected

100

as above and fixed at 24 hours post-transfection in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at

101

room temperature (RT) followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma)

102

for 5 min. Fixed cells were then blocked with PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum

103

for 30 min at RT. Cells were immunolabelled for 1 hour at RT with the indicated murine

104

mAb and 45 min with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Life

105

Technologies). Immunolabelled coverslips were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma), and

106

mounted using ProLong® Gold Antifade Mountant (Molecular Probes). Images were

107

acquired with Olympus CKX53 microscope using Olympus LCAch N 20x/0.40

115

were fixed with chilled methanol/acetone and the cells were kept in -20°C overnight.

116

Cells were then stained using mAb 1A9 at 5µg/ml at 37°C for 30 minutes in

117

immunofluorescence buffer (BSA 0.2%, Triton X100 0.1% in PBS, pH 7.4). They were

multiple sequence alignment was created with MAFFT using the slow but accurate L-

127

INS-I parameter settings [21] and the alignment curated, cut to the target region 1029-

128

129

calculate the number of amino acid differences for all sequence pairs in the alignment of

130

the mAb target region (Figure 1B) and the full S protein (Figure 1C) normalized by the

131

length of the aligned sequence of the respective reference protein to obtain percent amino

To determine within-outbreak sequence diversity in the spike glycoprotein, 230 human

134

and environmental outbreak virus sequences were downloaded from the GISAID

135

database on March 1st 2020. We gratefully acknowledge the authors, originating and

136

submitting laboratories of the sequences from GISAID’s EpiCoV™ Database on which

137

this part of the research is based. The list is detailed in Supplementary Table 1. The

138

nucleotide sequences were searched with BLASTX against the reference spike

139

glycoprotein. 174 hits covered the full length of the spike glycoprotein and amino acid

140

mutations were counted and tabulated using a custom Perl script (Supplementary Table 2).

Results

143

An immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV is highly conserved in SARS-

144

CoV-2 but not in endemic coronaviruses

145

By using five different fragments of SARS-CoV S to immunize rabbits, a fragment

146

corresponding to residues 1029 to 1192 was found to stimulate neutralizing antibodies

147

against SARS-CoV [24]. Interestingly, sequence alignment shows that this domain,

148

which encompasses the heptad repeat (HR) 2 but not HR1, is highly conserved in SARS-

149

CoV-2 (Figure 1A). When compared with additional reference sequences from bat

150

RaTG13 (closest bat precursor), MERS and human common cold coronaviruses 229E,

151

NL63, OC43 and HKU1 (Figure 1A), it becomes apparent that the amino acid identity

152

between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is much higher in this region (93%, Figure 1B)

153

than over the full protein length (78%, Figure 1C) and the similarity drops sharply (<40%

Four murine mAbs bind to a fragment of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2

165

Subsequently, a panel of murine mAbs was generated using SARS-CoV S(aa1029-1192)

166

fragment and found to have neutralizing activities in vitro [19]. Four mAbs with distinct

167

binding profiles, as mapped by internal deletion mutagenesis study, were selected for

168

testing to determine if they cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. A fragment containing

169

residues 1048 to 1206 of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 was expressed in COS-7 cells via

170

transient transfection and Western blot analysis was performed using four mAbs, namely

171

2B2, 1A9, 4B12 and 1G10. As shown in Figure 2A, all 4 mAbs detected this fragment of

172

SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with the sequence alignment shown in Figure 1A.

173

Similarly, immunofluorescence analysis performed on transiently transfected COS-7 cells

174

showed binding of the 4 mAbs to this S fragment of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2B).

Four murine mAbs bind to the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV-2

177

Next, the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV-2 was overexpressed in COS-7 cells and

178

probed with each of the mAbs. As shown in Figure 3, all 4 mAbs bound to the full-length

179

S protein of SARS-CoV-2.

Mab1A9 binds to S expressed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells

182

Since mAb 1A9 was previously shown to have broad cross-reactivity to civet SARS-CoV

183

and bat SL-CoV strains [20], it was tested on SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero-E6 cells. As

184

shown in Figure 4, mAb 1A9 stained a significant number of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells

185

at 24h post-infection showing that it is sensitive enough to detect the expression of S

186

during infection.

187
188

Discussion

189

Numerous mAbs against the S protein of SARS-CoV have been generated for research

190

and diagnostic assay development. Some of these may be able to cross-react with the S

191

protein of SARS-CoV-2 and serve as tools to aid research on this newly emerged virus.

192

In this current study, an immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV was found

193

to be highly conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2. Consistently, WB and IF

194

analyses showed that 4 different mAbs generated using this SARS-CoV domain were

195

cross-reactive against the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, mAb 1A9 stained a

196

significant number of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells at 24h post-infection showing that it is

197

sensitive enough to detect the expression of S during infection. Thus, these mAbs will be

198

useful for studying the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and development of

199

diagnostic assays for COVID-19. It is noteworthy that cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)

200

epitopes also reside at residues 884-891 and 1116-1123 within the S2 subunit of SARS-

201

CoV [26]. Interestingly, the latter CTL epitope overlaps with the epitope recognized by

202

mAb 1A9 [20]. Hence, the S2 subunit may serve as an important antigen for inducing

203

both humoral as well as cell-mediated immunity against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

204

Recent cross-reactivity studies have evaluated SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies that

205

bind to the RBD-containing S1 subunit. Although both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use

206

ACE2 as a receptor for viral entry [3,10], several SARS-CoV RBD-directed mAbs did

207

not cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD [27,28]. Interestingly, CR3022, which was

208

isolated from a SARS convalescent patient, showed cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2

209

RBD and recognizes an epitope that does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site [28]. To

210

our knowledge, this is the first study showing that mAbs targeting the S2 domain of

211

SARS-CoV can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and this observation is consistent with the

212

high sequence conservation in the S2 subunit. Besides the mAbs characterized here,

213

several other mAbs have been reported to bind to epitopes in the S2 subunit of SARS-

214

CoV [29-31]. Thus, it will be important to determine if these mAbs can also cross-react

215

with SARS-CoV-2.
