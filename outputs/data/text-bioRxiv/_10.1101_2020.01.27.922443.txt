Abstract
Background
A novel coronavirus pneumonia initially identified in Wuhan, China and provisionally named
2019-nCoV has surged in the public. In anticipation of substantial burdens on healthcare
system following this human-to-human spread, we aim to scrutinise the currently available
information and evaluate the burden of healthcare systems during this outbreak in Wuhan.

Methods and Findings
We applied a modified SIR model to project the actual number of infected cases and the
specific burdens on isolation wards and intensive care units (ICU), given the scenarios of
different diagnosis rates as well as different public health intervention efficacy. Our estimates
suggest, assuming 50% diagnosis rate if no public health interventions were implemented,
that the actual number of infected cases could be much higher than the reported, with
estimated 88,075 cases (as of 31st January, 2020), and projected burdens on isolation wards
and ICU would be 34,786 and 9,346 respectively The estimated burdens on healthcare
system could be largely reduced if at least 70% efficacy of public health intervention is
achieved.

Conclusion
The health system burdens arising from the actual number of cases infected by the novel
coronavirus appear to be considerable if no effective public health interventions were
implemented. This calls for continuation of implemented anti-transmission measures (e.g.,
closure of schools and facilities, suspension of public transport, lockdown of city) and further
effective large-scale interventions spanning all subgroups of populations (e.g., universal

1. Background
A novel coronavirus pneumonia, initially identified in Wuhan, Central China and now named
as 2019-nCoV[1], has surged in the public. As from late January 2020, authorities had
reported more than 6,000 confirmed cases across nearly all provinces in mainland China and
confirmed over 130 deaths. Globally, more than 13 countries or regions have reported
confirmed cases including domestic cases. With the increasing incidence of confirmed cases,
corresponding spread control policies and emergency actions are taking place.

The symptom onset date of the first 2019-nCoV patient was identified in early December
2019 and the outbreak started in late December with most of cases epidemiologically
connected to a seafood market in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China [2]. Following
the cases reported in other Chinese cities and overseas, the National Health Commission
(NHC) of People’s Republic of China confirmed the evidence of human-to-human
transmission of such viral pneumonia[3]. Most of confirmed cases so far are travellers from
or ever been to Wuhan or other Chinese cities. Several counties also reported their first
domestic cases. The number of confirmed cases is expected to increase given the availability
of fast-track laboratory test and anticipated country-wide commute arising from Chinese new
year holidays.

To combat the 2019-nCoV outbreak, authorities in China have implemented several
preventive measures. Starting from 10am, 23rd January, all public transport has been
temporarily suspended following by the lockdown on the city of Wuhan[4]. Neighbouring
cities also announced a lockdown in sequence. Local residents were advised to remain at
home and avoid gathering in order to contain the virus spread. Following the raise of

protection standards instructed by NHC, prevention and control measures, such as
disinfection for public facilities, have been strengthened and taking places in other cities[5].
Residents are also being ordered to adopt personal precautionary practices including
facemask wear in public areas by law.[6]

Earlier studies on the effectiveness of spread control measures during infectious disease
pandemic showed large-scale strategies, such as closure of school closure, case isolation,
household quarantine, internal travel restrictions and border control, were able to delay the
spread and/or reduce incidence rate at certain periods through the outbreak season.[7-9]

Whilst awaiting the effectiveness of a series of measures to be seen, such evolving outbreak
is expected to impose substantial burdens on healthcare system. Normally, a regional
university-based hospital in China is equipped with 500-1,000 beds with only a small portion
allocated for isolation purpose. Arising from the forecasting demands, increasing numbers of
isolation beds and intensive care units (ICUs) for subsequent severe cases will be
unquestionably required. Uncertainty of the capacity of current healthcare resources to tackle
such sizable increase in demand is raised.

In anticipation of substantial burdens on healthcare system following this human-to-human
transmissible epidemic, we aim to scrutinise the currently available information and evaluate
the burden of healthcare system during the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China. We hope, by doing
so, that the findings would be able to provide efficacious suggestions on reducing the spreads
on the large scale and help authorities formulate effective control measures on combating this
emerging viral outbreak.

2. Methods
In the classic SIR model, S represents the susceptible population, I represents the infected
population, and R represents the recovered population. Susceptible population can be infected,
who would be cured or died of the infection. The composition of susceptible, infected,
recovered, deceased population is modelled based on a set of transition probabilities.

In this study, we applied a modified SIR model to evaluate the burden of healthcare system
during the 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan, China. Figure 1 shows the design of our model.
Each cycle is one day in our model. The parameters used in the model were estimated based
on the reported incidence released by the NHC of the People’s Republic of China or recent
investigation on the outbreak (

China is available from 11th January, 2020.[10] However, given that the probability of
misdiagnosis is likely to be high in the early stage of the outbreak, we used the reported
incidence between 0:00-24:00 on 28th Jan, 2020 (the most updated data when the analysis
was performed).

Wuhan. Considering that cases without being diagnosed would mostly have mild symptoms,
we assumed that the average number of days needed to recover to be 12.5 days for these
cases. Thus, the probabilities of recovering if not being hospitalised within any given day
(self_recover) was estimated by 1 divided by the average number of days needed to recover.
We also assumed that, if being admitted to the hospital, the average number of days in
isolation ward and ICU to be 20 and 25 days, respectively. Thus, the probabilities of
recovering in any given day in the hospital were estimated by 1 divided by the average
number of days in isolation ward (Iso_recover) or ICU (ICU_recover). We also assumed that
a total of 5% of the confirmed cases admitted to isolation ward would experience
deterioration of the symptoms and be transferred to ICU. Therefore, in any one day, the
probability of being transferred to ICU from isolation ward (ICU_after_Isolation) was
estimated by 5% divided by the average number of days in isolation ward. We considered an
overall death rate of 14% among the hospitalised cases according to the recent investigation
by researchers from the University of Hong Kong.[11] Therefore, the probability of being
dead within any given day in the ICU (death_rate) was estimated by 14% divided by the
average number of days in ICU. Lastly, the report by the MRC Centre for Global Infectious
Disease Analysis at Imperial College London suggests there were a total of 4,000 cases of
2019-nCoV in Wuhan City (uncertainty range: 1,000 – 9,700) by 18th January 2020.[12]
Comparing to the number of cases released by the NHC of the People’s Republic of China,
this report suggests a diagnosis rate of less than 10%. Therefore, we considered multiple
scenarios with different probabilities of being diagnosed (10%, 50%, 90%, and 100%) if
being infected (Dx_rate).

3. Results
Figure 2 and Figure 3 depict our estimated daily numbers of beds occupied in isolation ward
and ICU using a modified SIR model based on the currently available information. We
generated curves of four hypothesised diagnosis rates to project the burden on healthcare
system. For diagnosis rates of 100%, 90% and 50%, our projections showed that between
18,311 and 34,786 beds in isolation ward and between 4,938 and 9,346 beds in ICU would be
needed by the end of January. However, in the scenario of 10% diagnosis rate, the predicted
number of beds occupied is expected to soar and would reach 103,131 in isolation ward and
27,277 in ICU by the end of January.

We also investigated the specific burdens on isolation ward (Figure 4) and ICU (Figure 5)
assuming a 50% diagnosis rate, given public health intervention scenarios of baseline (no
intervention), 70%, 80% and 90% efficacy rates. If a 70% efficacy rate of public health
intervention could be achieved, the number of cases being admitted to isolation ward and
ICU would drop to a large extent throughout the course of outbreak. Similarly, greater
benefits for healthcare system are expected to obtain if higher efficacy can be achieved (e.g.,
80% or 90%). Total number of deaths would also be greatly reduced (Figure 6). By 31st
January, the total number of deaths under the no public health intervention scenario would be
more than two times higher than that under the 70% efficacy rate of public health
intervention.

As of 31st January, it is estimated that there were 246,172 cases given a 10% diagnosis rate
whilst being 88,075 and 52,094 cases given diagnosis rates of 50% and 90%, respectively, if
no public health interventions were implemented (Table 2). We further estimated the total
number of cases with public health intervention efficacy of 70%, 80% and 90%, assuming a
50% diagnosis rate (Scenarios 4, 5 and 6). If 70% efficacy rate could be achieved (Scenario
4), the forecasting number of cases would drop dramatically to 11,056 as of 10th February
compared to 115,355 without public health interventions (Scenario 2). Even fewer cases can
be expected if higher efficacy (e.g., 80% or 90%) is achieved.

4. Discussion
In this study, we synthesised available information during the 2019-nCoV outbreak occurring
in Wuhan city, China, and estimated the burden on healthcare system effected by the
increasing numbers of cases using a modified SIR model. Our results suggest the actual
number of infected cases could be much higher than the reported as the spread continues.

Therefore, the burdens on healthcare system would be substantial, particularly for the
isolation wards and ICU, if no effective public health interventions were implemented.

Our analysis is limited by the availability of data and the lack of understanding of 2019nCoV. First, SIR model can be substantially affected by the input parameters, i.e., the
transition probabilities, which were estimated based on either the data released by the NHC
of the People’s Republic of China or other recent investigations. Only the reported incidence
between 0:00 and 24:00 on 28th Jan 2020 was used at this stage. As more data become
available, further investigation should be considered. Second, classic SIR model assumes a
constant infection rate, which is not likely to be true as interventions being implemented.
Therefore, in this study, we constructed SIR models with multiple efficacy rates of public
health interventions as proxy for the change of infection rate. Third, our prediction can be
influenced by the diagnosis rate. Therefore, we simulated a number of scenarios with
different hypothesised diagnosis rates of 10%, 50% and 90% to estimate the actual number of
infected cases. For the reason of mild or moderate symptoms reported by part of infected
cases and the relatively long incubation period observed, it is reasonable to model a context
of low diagnosis rate. In fact, recent investigation also suggests the current diagnosis rate
could be low and likely lower than 10%.[13] Our estimates appear to be close to the recently
published estimates[13].

Our results emphasised the vital importance of efficacious public health interventions during
the course of outbreak. Established human-to-human transmissibility of this novel
coronavirus can be one of epidemiological factors that contribute to the accelerated spreads
within the epicentre Wuhan and towards cities and regions via transports of those with no or

only subclinical symptoms. Sustained human transmission (i.e., basic reproduction number
R0 > 1) is supported by the confirmed human-to-human transmissibility.[13] Therefore,
upstream measures that limit or block the viral transmission between individuals within and
across cities are urgently needed. Fortunately, the lockdown of Wuhan city has taken place
and is believed to have largely minimised the spreads from the epicentre to other areas.
However, the mayor of Wuhan later announced approximately five million of residents had
left the city ahead of the implementation of lockdown (due to scheduled travel during
Chinese new year and panic about the lockdown)[14], which may compromise the antispread effect of such city lockdown measure as to spreads to other cities. To date,
information on transmission modes and severity of this novel coronavirus is still limited [15].
Further preventive measures to diminish contact between persons and reduce social distance,
such as school closure, public transport shutdown, common activities suspension, etc.[7, 8],
should be implemented as to avoidance of healthcare system breakdown.

To achieve higher efficacy of the public health interventions, efforts from individuals should
not be neglected. In light of no available specific vaccines and treatments for such novel
coronavirus thus far, a range of precautionary behaviours between individuals at homes and
in communities are essential and vital to obtain proper control of the spreads in public and
likely preventing superspreading events. Personal prevention strategies for seasonal influenza
and other viral infections are still applicable during the present outbreak, inclusive of
restricting ill residents from common activities, excluding symptomatic persons from
entering homes/facilities, limiting visit especially of wet markets, live poultry markets or
farms. Maintaining personal hygiene (e.g., frequently performing hand hygiene, washing
hands with soap and water) and cough etiquette (e.g., covering nose and mouth when
coughing, correctly disposing wasted tissues after coughing) are also beneficial.

Amongst these preventive practices, facemask wear appears to be the most operationalised
and thus effective since it is observable from other members of the public. A recent cluster
randomised controlled trial[16], consisting of multiple region-varying medical settings,
showed both N95 respirators and medical masks can effectively prevent influenza and other
viral respiratory infections. Apart from facemask wear being required in public of the
epicentre city in Hubei province, it has also been mandated by the Guangdong provincial
government that facemasks should be worn in public with effect from 26th January, four days
after the implementation in Wuhan. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the
United States, also emphasised the importance of wearing a facemask at all times when
staying with infected individuals in shared spaces as one of precautions for large-scale
spreads in community, specified in their interim guidance for prevention for 2019-nCoV from
spreading in home and communities[17]. All these are extremely important in raising
awareness in the public as to personal preventive steps given the present situation (mild or
subclinical symptoms observed in many cases and observed long incubation period).
Operational issues associated with wearing disposable facemasks to maximise their
preventive effectiveness should be also publicised and educated to the general public
including correct ways of wearing facemask, hygiene practices across the procedure of mask
wearing, disposal of used masks.

Volunteering from healthcare professionals appears to play a major role in reduction of fears
amongst the public. Imported healthcare support from other cities are certainly vital to the
healthcare system in Wuhan during the present outbreak.[18] It is also noteworthy that
volunteers with medical backgrounds (e.g., medical trainees, health science students) are

actively instilling scientific insight and evidence-based knowledge via the Internet to
eliminate rumours spread across Chinse social media [19]. We believe that these volunteering
activities can contribute to a successful delivery of public health principle and, in turn,
efficacious interventions.

The basic reproductive number of this novel coronavirus has been estimated in recent studies
(range from 2.6 to 6.47)[13, 20-24], suggesting its spread being as similar as or more efficient
than seasonal influenza. Our estimates also indicate that a country-wide outbreak or even an
international outbreak is foreseeable. It is thus essential to implement effective public health
measures to curb this very outbreak without delay. Otherwise, the current healthcare system
would not be able to sustain. Once the breakdown occurred, mortality would be expected to
soar due to lack of medical resources. Home isolation for patients with mild symptoms could
be one of the possible managements if the ultimate limit of isolation beds at the city or
province level was exceeded.

We hope that all the essential measures mentioned above can be inclusively implemented so
as to achieve at least 70% efficacy as our projection. Any primary preventive steps are
expected to be contributed to the curb on viral transmission and ultimately bring about the
emergency situation to a controllable level via a functioning healthcare system.
