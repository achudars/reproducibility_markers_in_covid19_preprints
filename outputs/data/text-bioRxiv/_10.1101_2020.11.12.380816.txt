Abstract
In the current study we analyzed the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from Italy, Sweden,
Congo (countries in the same meridian) and Brazil, as outgroup country. Evolutionary analysis revealed
codon 9628 under episodic selective pressure for all four countries, suggesting it as a key site for the
virus evolution. Belonging to the P0DTD3 (Y14_SARS2) uncharacterized protein 14, further
investigation has been conducted showing the codon mutation as responsible for the helical modification
in the secondary structure. According to the predictions done, the codon is placed into the more ordered
region of the gene (41-59) and close the area acting as transmembrane (54-67), suggesting its
involvement into the attachment phase of the virus. The predicted structures of P0DTD3 mutated and
not confirmed the importance of the codon to define the protein structure and the ontological analysis
of the protein emphasized that the mutation enhances the binding probability.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus currently, in 2020, is the
most threatening severe acute respiratory infection in the world. Many attempts to create an effective
vaccine against this infection are still in the developing stages and challenging (Bar-Zeev and Inglesby,
2020, Logunov et al., 2020).
The SARS-CoV-2 genome shares about 82% sequence identity with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and >
90% sequence identity for essential enzymes and structural proteins. This high level of the sequence
identity suggests a common pathogenesis mechanism, thus, therapeutic targeting. Structurally, SARSCoV-2 contains four structural proteins, that include spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and
nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Naqvi et al., 2020). The structure and the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
are under extensive study and the results seem to be controversial. It was shown that the two integral
membrane proteins (matrix (M) and envelope(E)) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide
mutations on their corresponding genes, but genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike
proteins (S), regarded as important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to
evolve faster (Dilucca et al., 2020). However, other studies showed that potential drug targets of SARSCoV-2 are highly conserved (Naqvi et al., 2020).
The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is comprised of a single-stranded positive-sense RNA. The newly
sequenced genome of the SARS-CoV-2 was submitted in the NCBI genome database (NC_045512.2)
~30 Kb in size. The genetic makeup of SARS-CoV-2 is composed of 13–15 (12 functional) open reading
frames (ORFs) containing ~30,000 nucleotides. The genome contains 38% of the GC content and 11
protein-coding genes, with 12 expressed proteins (Naqvi et al., 2020).
The genomic characterization of 95 SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed three most common mutations that
might affect the severity and spread of the SARS-CoV-2(Khailany et al., 2020). Another study
highlighted the crucial genomic features that are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and two other deadly
coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These features correlate with the high fatality rate of these
coronaviruses as well as their ability to switch hosts from animals to humans (Gussow et al., 2020).
The SARS-CoV-2 affected almost every country in the world. COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic
and as on 25 October 2020, over 40 million people had been infected and more than 0.934 million deaths.
It is tempting to speculate that the epidemiological and clinical features may differ among different
countries or continents.
Genomic comparison of 48,635 SARS-CoV-2 genomes has shown that the average number of mutations
per sample was 7.23, and most SARS-CoV-2 strains belong to one of three clades characterized by
geographic and genomic specificity: clade G (Europe), clade L (Asia) and G-derived clade (North
America) (Mercatelli and Giorgi, 2020).

The obtained results suggest custom-designed antiviral strategies based on the molecular specificities
of SARS-CoV-2 in different patients and geographical locations (Mercatelli and Giorgi, 2020). The
early study also differentiated three variants according to the geographic location (East Asia, Europe
and America) (Forster et al., 2020). More recent genome-wide analysis revealed that frequency of aa
mutations were relatively higher in the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of Europe (43.07%) followed
by Asia (38.09%), and North America (29.64%) while case fatality rates remained higher in the
European temperate countries, such as Italy, Spain, Netherlands, France, England and Belgium (Islam
et al., 2020).
The aim of study was to compare the set of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from viruses isolated from the
countries in the same meridian (longitude): Italy, Sweden, Congo, but with different climate to reveal
similar or different pattern of possible evolutionary pressure signatures in their genomes.

Methods
Sequence data
We obtained the data from the GISaid repository sampling all the genomes available to that date (May
5, 2020). In details, the file congo-gisaid_hcov-19_2020_05_05_09.fasta with 75 entries, the file italygisaid_hcov-19_2020_05_05_10.fasta

19_2020_05_15_04.fasta contained 92 entries. The reference genome with Accession Number
NC_045512.2 has been downloaded from the GenBank repository.
Evolution model analysis
The SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 genome (RefSeq Acc. No. NC_045512.2) has been used as reference
sequence and the VIRULIGN version 1.0.1 application (Libin et al., 2019) to perform the multiple
sequence alignment while the AliView version 1.26 application has supported its visualization (Larsson,
2014). HyPhy 2.5.8 (MP) achieved the recombination analysis by the GARD method, the trimming, the
removal of the stop codons, the phylogenetic tree and the MEME (Mixed Effects Model of Evolution)
analysis (Murrell et al., 2012). The http://vision.hyphy.org/MEME web site has been used to read JSON
output files and generate the MEME pictures and tables.
RNA secondary structure prediction
RNA_fold web server (part of the Vienna RNA Web Suite) predicted the secondary structures of both
the sequences (mutated and not) (Lorenz et al., 2011), whereas the graph diagrams have been built using
Forna package (Kerpedjiev et al., 2015).

Protein analysis
The “disorder analysis” of the protein has been conducted by means of MFDp2 (Mizianty et al., 2014),
NetSurfP-2.0 (Klausen et al., 2019) and SPOT-Disorder2 (Hanson et al., 2019) applications. The
“transmembrane analysis” of the protein has been calculated using the TMHHM server v.2.0, the
MemBrain webserver (Yin et al., 2018), the ProtScale (Wilkins et al., 1999) and TMpred (Hofmann,
1993) (scores have been normalized for comparison) on Expasy website (Gasteiger et al., 2003).
3D protein structure prediction and ontologies
Both of the protein structures have been calculated with ab initio approach using the Robetta webserver
(Kim et al., 2004) while DeeProtein capsule from OCEAN CODE (Upmeier zu Belzen et al., 2019) was
used to predict the ontologies of the predicted proteins. Three dimensional images of protein structures
and their ontologies have been released using PyMOL 2.4.0 (Rigsby and Parker, 2016).
Results

In this context we use the term “site” as synonymous of codon, respecting the HyPhy terminology. The
asymptotic p-value for episodic diversification at site 9628 results equal to zero in all cases and Figure
1 shows the distribution of the p-value over the sites for all countries.

The deep check of the multiple alignment data of the countries revealed the episodic positive selective
pressure on site 9628 as a consistent mutation of the codon GGG to ACG, as showed in the Figure 2.

site 9628 under episodic selective pressure. The nucleotides mute from GGG to ACG
RNA secondary structure prediction changes
The secondary structure prediction before and after mutation shows important differences. In detail, the
mutation from GGG to ACG has been applied to the RNA sequence as shown in the Figure 3. The
comparison between the prediction of the two secondary structures highlighted structural modification
at the top-right ring of the RNA-conformation, as depicted in the Figure 4. This result induces to suppose
the GGG to ACG mutation as responsible for a significant modification of the RNA secondary structure.

affected by the GGG to ACG mutation.
Protein analysis
The analysis of the protein conducted for finding its disordered region, turns out the positions from 41
to 59 as the more stable, with the Glycine (G) amino-acid placed at the 50th. We gained the results by
using three different software and considering the average value for the probability of disorder, as
reported by the Table 2 and represented in the Figure 5. Further analysis to locate the transmembrane
region in the protein, revealed the locations from 54 to 67 as associated to this function. The analysis,
conducted with the utilization of four distinct web applications and by evaluating their average values,
puts the Glycine (G) amino-acid as fairly near to the transmembrane region to suppose its involvement.
Table 3 reports some of the data showing the probabilities of acting as transmembrane for each
aminoacidic position, while Figure 6 illustrates the distribution of the probabilities by remarking the
region mentioned above.

Figure 6 Transmembrane prediction. The region 54-67 results as that one with highest probability to
code for the transmembrane and G amino-acid is near enough to suppose its involvement. The orange
rectangle delimits the region and the blue dots outline the position of G on the different curves
3-Dimensional Protein analysis
Being P0DTD3.1 an uncharacterized protein, it has been necessary to predict the three-dimensional
structure using the ab initio approach for both the protein sequences, mutated and not. According to the
preliminary clue from the secondary structure prediction, the model of the mutated protein presents a
slightly different structure around the aminoacidic residue changing from G to T. The Figures 7 and 8
illustrate the predicted two models showing as the mentioned mutation impacts the tertiary structure of
the protein. In fact, the comparison between the residues 45-55 in MUT31136 and MOD30336 turns
out that portion of the protein subject to the mutation stretches out with repercussions to the preceding
helix. This result suggests that the mutation of the single amino-acid from G to T with the consecutive
stretching upon the 3D structure of the protein tends to make the protein acquire new functions.

Protein related ontologies prediction
The analysis of the protein ontologies established different functions to the protein structure depending
on whether it has mutated or not. As the Table 4 points out, the unchanged protein results related to
catalytic and transferase activities with high probability (0.978 ≤ 𝑝 ≤ 1). The mutated version of the
protein presents a remarkable changing of its functionalities trend: even if usually the scores
below 0.5 are interpreted as negative predictions, in an evolutionary context the decreasing of the
probability of the transferase activity (from 0.98 to 0.375) to advantage of the binding function (from
0.004 to 0.132) sounds like not negligible. The contextual inversion of tendency of transferase to binding
activity hints that the episodic evolutionary mutation aims to improve the binding ability.

Discussion and Conclusions
The recent worldwide outbreak of the COVID-19 disease is still ongoing and many researchers trying
to make their input to the slowing down the spread of the disease as well as any other aspects such as
study of epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, treatment, and prevention. The main target
for research is the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a novel coronavirus originated from Wuhan, China. To date,
much is known about the structure, genetics and virulence of this virus, but many important questions
are still not clear.
From the evolutionary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 now is known that the virus has the tendency to
increasing mutation rate comparing to other Coronaviridae, such as SARS-COV, which has a moderate
mutation rate(Zhao et al., 2004). The prevalence of single nucleotide transitions as the major mutational
type across the world has been shown for SAR-CoV-2 virus (Mercatelli and Giorgi, 2020).
Our results shown that codon 9628 is under episodic selective pressure for all four countries. This leads
that RNA secondary structure may be affected and consequently the protein product changes T
(Threonine) to G (Glycine) in position 50 of the protein. This position is located close to the predicted
transmembrane region. The mutation analysis revealed that change from G (Glycine) to D (Aspartic
acid) may confer a new function to the protein, binding activity, which in turn may be responsible for

attaching the virus to human eukaryotic cells. These can be accessed by in vitro experiments and
possibly later facilitate a vaccine design and successful antiviral strategies.
Similar results presented by Mercatelli and Georgi have confirmed that clade G, prevalent in Europe,
carries a D614G mutation in the Spike protein, which is responsible for the initial interaction of the virus
with the host human cell. Other studies also showed different mutation location among different
continents. Mutations in 2891, 3036, 14408, 23403 and 28881 positions are predominantly observed in
Europe, whereas those located at positions 17746, 17857 and 18060 are exclusively present in North
America (Pachetti et al., 2020). Their findings suggest that the virus is evolving and European, North
American and Asian strains might coexist, each of them characterized by a different mutation pattern.
Comparison of genomes from 13 countries also identified differences in protein coding sequences od
SARS-CoV-2. For example, Indian strain showed mutation in spike glycoprotein at R408I and in
replicase polyprotein at I671T, P2144S and A2798V, while the spike protein of Spain & South Korea
carried F797C and S221W mutation, respectively (Khan et al., 2020). Moreover, the recently conducted
integrative analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from different geographical locations reveal unique
features potentially consequential to host-virus interaction and pathogenesis (Sardar et al., 2020).
However, the most recent to date study of genomic diversity and hotspot mutations in 30,983 SARSCoV-2 genomes indicate that unlike the influenza virus or HIV viruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a low
mutation rate which makes the development of an effective global vaccine very likely (Alouane et al.,
2020). The study determined a number of hotspot mutations across the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome.
Fourteen non-synonymous hotspot mutations (>10%) have been identified at different locations along
the viral genome; eight in ORF1ab polyprotein (in nsp2, nsp3, transmembrane domain, RdRp, helicase,
exonuclease, and endoribonuclease), three in nucleocapsid protein, and one in each of three proteins:
Spike, ORF3a, and ORF8. Moreover, 36 non-synonymous mutations were identified in the receptorbinding domain (RBD) of the spike protein with a low prevalence (<1%) across all genomes (Alouane
et al., 2020).
All these findings highlighted the importance of studying the relationship of geography of the isolates
and mutations in their genomes because it is also can be confirmed by inferring from phylogenomic
trees allowing to elucidate lineages and clusters accordingly to the geographical locations.
In conclusion, although we did not found correlation between countries located at the same meridian,
we revealed that codon 9628 is under episodic selective pressure for all four countries.
