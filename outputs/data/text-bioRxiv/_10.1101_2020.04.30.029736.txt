ABSTRACT
Since SARS-CoV-2 became a pandemic event in the world, it has not only
caused huge economic losses, but also a serious threat to global public health.
Many scientific questions about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 were raised and
urgently need to be answered, including the susceptibility of animals to
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we tested whether tree shrew, an emerging
experimental animal domesticated from wild animal, is susceptible to
SARS-CoV-2 infection. No clinical signs were observed in SARS-CoV-2
inoculated tree shrews during this experiment except the increasing body
temperature (above 39

) particular in female animals during infection. Low

levels of virus shedding and replication in tissues occurred in all three age
groups, each of which showed his own characteristics. Histopathological
examine revealed that pulmonary abnormalities were mild but the main
changes although slight lesions were also observed in other tissues. In
summary, tree shrew is not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may not
be a suitable animal for COVID-19 related researches.

The manifestation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is known as COVID-19.
Since the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection reported in Wuhan, China, it has
been about five months. It causes a pandemic with more than three million
confirmed cases and nearly 230 thousand deaths in addition to huge economic
losses to the world1. Nevertheless, it is widely considered to be controllable
according to the experiences from China and other countries. However, there
are still some critical aspects that need to be further investigated in COVID-19
patients, such as cytokine storm, immunopathogenic damages, tropism of
SARS-CoV-2, and other sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection besides bat and
pangolin that are regarded as the origin of SARS-CoV-22-4. From these points
of view, studies of animals become essentially important. In fact, several
animal models of COVID-19 have been recently reported in murine5, hamster6,
ferret7, and non-human primate8-11, which recapitulate COVID-19 from
different aspects. In terms of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, in addition to these
experimental animals, domestic animals and pets are also investigated12. Cats,
as a popular pet, could be an important source of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to
their close relationship with human beings.

The tree shrew, also known as Tupaia belangeris, is genetically demonstrated
to be close to primates13-15. Therefore, it is being developed to be an
experimental animal that could be an alternative to primates in biomedical
research due to its unique characteristics16. In fact, tree shrew has been used
for several animal models of virus infections, including hepatitis B17, influenza
virus18-20, and Zika virus21. However, Tupaia model of high pathogenic viruses
has not been reported yet, including SARS-CoV-2. Several reports show that
SARS-CoV-2 may originate from wild animals2-4. Replication of SARS-CoV-2
in tree shrews is still unknown. In this study, in order to determine the
possibility of tree shrew as a COVID-19 model, we tested the susceptibility of
tree shrew to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that SARS-CoV-2 had limited
replication and shedding in tree shrew, and cause mild histopathology, but no

typical symptom is observed in infected tree shrew as reported in COVID-19
patients.

METHODS
Experimental animals and Ethics
Tree shew, Tupaia belangeri chinensis, were bred in the institute of medical
biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. After quarantine and before
infection, animals were transferred to ABSL-3 facility and housed in the isolated
ventilation cages, with 12-hour light and 12-hour dark. All animal procedures
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Institute
of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Ethics number:
DWSP202002 001), and performed in the ABSL-3 facility of National Kunming
High-level Biosafety Primate Research Center, Yunnan China.
Study procedures
Procedures in this study are outlined in Figure 1. Total 24 tree shrews were
used in this study, and divided into three groups with consideration of gender
and age, including young (6 months to 12 months), adult (2 years to 4 years)
and old (5 years to 7 years) groups. Each group contains half male and half
female animals.
After baseline data and samples were collected right before virus inoculation,
each of tree shrew was inoculated with 1 ml 106 pfu SARS-CoV-2 nasally
(500ul/each nostril). Clinical signs were recorded daily, including behavior,
drinking and eating, breathing, feces and so on. Body temperature was also
monitored every other day post viral inoculation. At the same time points, nasal,
throat and anal swab, and blood samples were collected. Viral genomic RNA in
these samples was quantified by RT-qPCR using virus-specific primers and
probes. On day 14 post viral inoculation, six animals were anesthetized, bled
and necropsied. After gross lesions were recorded, tissue samples were
harvested for analysis of viral loads and histopathology.

Quantification of viral genomic RNA
Swab samples soaked in Trizol solution were vortexed and swabs were
removed. 200 µl of each sample were used for RNA extraction and purification
via the kit Direct-zol™ RNA MiniPrep. Tissue samples were homogenized in
Trizol and 200 µl of each for total RNA preparation. Briefly, 50µl
RNase/DNase-free H2O was used to elute RNA from the column. 7.5 µl of each
RNA was analyzed in each well of 384-well plate by one-step RT-qPCR using
gene-specific primers and probe as described before8.
Histopathological analysis
Tissue samples of heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, weasand, stomach, small
intestine, rectum, pancreas, brain, spinal cord, uterus, penis, testis, cecum
were harvested and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Paraffin-embedded
tissues were cut into 5 µm of sections, followed by haematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) staining. Slides were scanned with 3DHISTECH and inspected by the
experienced pathologist using the manufacture provided software CaseViewer.

RESULTS
Clinical signs in SARS-CoV-2 infected tree shrew
During the period of this study, we couldn’t observe any other clinical sign
besides change of body temperature. After SARS-COV-2 inoculation, body
temperature of tree shrew was monitored every other day. Among three ages
of virus-inoculated tree shrews, all young tree shrews except TS30 showed
increasing body temperature. There are 5 young tree shrews (2 males, 3
females) with peak body temperature on 6 or 8-day post inoculation (dpi),
followed by gradual decline. The peaks of body temperatures in two female
(TS31, TS34) and one male (TS28) young tree shrews were above 39

(Figure 1A). In addition, among old tree shrews, one male (TS1) and three
female (TS8, TS10 and TS12) had the peak body temperature (>39

) on 4 or

6 dpi. However, only one adult female (TS20) showed the peak body
temperature (39.2

) on 6 dpi (Figure 1B & C). These results indicated that

young/old tree shrews and female tree shrews showed higher sensitivity to
SARS-CoV-2 infection, as compared to adult and male tree shrews.

Virus shedding from SARS-CoV-2 infected tree shrew
On 6 dpi, we could detect genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in 5 nasal swabs, 3
throat swabs, 2 anal swabs and one serum sample from young tree shrews, in 2
nasal swabs from adult tree shrews and in 2 nasal swabs, 1 anal swab from old
tree shrew (Table 1). Notably, four samples (nasal, throat, anal swabs and
blood) collected from young tree shrew TS27 all showed virus RNA positive.
The highest copy number of viral genomic RNA was 105.92/ml in nasal swab
from the young tree shrew TS27. On 8 dpi, there were four young, three adult
and four old tree shrew with viral RNA positive in some of samples. The highest
level of virus shedding was still from the young tree shrew (TS28). On 12 dpi,
the young tree shrews showed the decreasing virus shedding and only the
animal TS27 had RNA-positive throat swab. In contrast, increasing number of
old tree shrews had detectable viral RNA in nasal, throat, and anal swabs
(Table 1). From these findings, we deduced that young tree shrew was more
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than adult and old tree shrew. However,

old tree shrew and adult tree shrews gave longer duration of virus shedding
than young tree shrews. Moreover, we noticed that more male animals of adult
and old tree shrews showed virus shedding than females.

Viral load in tissue samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected tree shrew
In order to determine viral load in tissue samples, we necropsied 8 animals from
3 ages of tree shrews on 14 dpi. Sixteen major tissues were collected from each
animal. Viral genomic RNA was quantified as described in Methods. In three
young tree shrews (TS26, TS27 and TS28), we could detect viral RNA from
only lungs in TS26 and TS27, but not in any tissue from TS28, although these
animal had higher number of viral genomic copy numbers at the earlier stage of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, in the adult tree shrew TS16, six tissues
were RNA positive with the highest number 109.08/ml in pancreas. The female
adult tree shrew TS14 had viral RNA-positive uterus in addition to lung and
pancreas. The other four necropsied tree shrews showed viral RNA-negative
results in all 16 tissues (Table S1).

Histopathological characteristics in SARS-CoV-2 infected tree shrew
To determine the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we examined
sixteen tissues from each of 24 tree shrews necropsied on 14 dpi and 16 dpi.
No gross lesion was observed in any organ of infected tree shrews.
Histopathological inspection revealed that 11 out of 16 tissues had various
degrees of pathological changes. The lung of tree shrews in all age groups
showed widened pulmonary septum, hyperemia of interstitium, airway

obstruction, consolidation of lung margin, local hemorrhagic necrosis, and
infiltration of inflammatory cells. Inflammatory cells infiltrated into the
submucosa of the trachea in the aged group. Some spleen corpuscles are in
active state, and the structure of spleen corpuscles is disordered. Hyperplasia
of intestinal gland was observed in the small intestine. The other tissues had
certain inflammatory infiltration and massive lymphocyte aggregation (Figure 2).
Overall evaluation of histopathology in tissues from all 24 tree shrews revealed
that all tissues, except lung, showed only mild histological abnormality. Lung
was the major organs affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mild pulmonary
abnormality was observed in 62.5%, intermediate abnormality in 12.5% and
severe in 4.2% of 24 tree shrews. Unexpectedly, we also found some mild
histopathological changes in brain, heart, liver and pancreas (Table 2).

DISCUSSIONS
The announcement of the genome of SARS-CoV-2 reveals the unique
relationship of SARS-CoV-2 with 2003 SARS-CoV and 2012 MERS-CoV22,
which not only attracts great attentions but also leads to many conjectures. The
main concerns are the origin of SARS-CoV-2, the natural reservoir,
intermediate host, factors affecting infection and prognosis, and so on. These
are actually about the sensitivity or susceptibility of host to SARS-CoV-2
infection12. Although the retrospective studies of COVID-19 have given us
some answers23, further investigation also needs to be performed in various
animals. So far, several animal models of COVID-19 have been reported to
successfully recapitulate some aspects of this disease5-11 and also indicate that
these experimental animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Rhinolophus sinicus is mostly recognized as the natural host for SARS-CoV-224.

However, the intermediate host is still controversial. Nevertheless, some
domestic animals and pets, including cat, can be infected by SARS-CoV-212.
Our previous study revealed the variable susceptibility among three species of
non-human primates to SARS-CoV-2 infection8. Here we experimentally
infected tree shrew, an emerging experimental animal genetically close to
NHP14. No typical clinical sign except the increasing body temperature was
observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected tree shrews, although viruses were
detectable in swabs, serum samples and some of tissues. These results
indicate that tree shrew may be a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2.
It is clinically reported that old COVID-19 patients show high morbidity and
mortality, which is thought to be associated with the comorbidities25. Children
confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection showed milder clinical symptoms than
adult COVID-19 patients 26. However, COVID-19 children are reported to be
critical in fecal-oral transmission due to persistence of fecal virus shedding
even though nasopharyngeal swabs are tested virus-negative 27. Results in
this study indicate that age may affect SARS-CoV-2 infection of tree shrew.
Firstly, more young and old tree shrews showed increasing body temperature
than adult tree shrews (Figure 1). Secondly, young tree shrews had more
severe virus shedding at the early stage of virus infection than the other
animals, and old tree shrews had a longer duration of virus shedding than
others (Table 1). One of young male tree shrew, TS27, didn’t have significant
increasing body temperature, but virus shedding from nasal, throat, anal and
serum was detected on 6 dpi. These results indicated the asymptomatic
infection of SARS-CoV-2 in young tree shrews.

Although SARS-CoV-2 infection didn’t cause severe disease in all three ages
of tree shrews, viral replication and mild histopathological changes were still

observed in this study. Particularly, we found the severe lung abnormality of
histology in one adult tree shrew, which may be caused by
immunopathological responses, such as cytokine storm 28. Unfortunately,
reagents for analysis of cytokines in tree shrews are very limited so that we
couldn’t further evaluate levels of inflammatory cytokines although we may
analyze mRNA levels of cytokines via RT-qPCR in the future.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been demonstrated as an
essential receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vertebrate animals29. The
interaction between ACE2 and RBD domain of viral spike protein determines
the susceptibility and range of host to SARS-CoV-2 infection30. Furthermore,
distribution of ACE2 in vivo may be associated with viral pathogenesis31.
However, no profile of ACE2 in various tissues of animal models has been
reported so far. Amino acid alignment of critical domain of ACE2 binding spike
protein RBD showed that there were 10 amino acid different between tree
shrew and human, whereas no difference exists between rhesus monkey and
human8. This may be one of the reasons that tree shrews are not susceptible
to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SARS-CoV-2 distribution of tissues in tree shrew is different from that reported
in autopsied COVID-19 patients. For example, high copy number of viral
genomic RNA was unexpectedly detected in kidney, pancreas, and spinal cord
in SARS-CoV-2 infected tree shrew (Table 3). These results should further be
confirmed via nucleic acid in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry or
immunofluorescent staining.

In conclusion, tree shrew is not as susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection as the
reported animal models of COVID-19, though limited replication of
SARS-CoV-2 and mild histopathology was detected and observed in some
tissues. In addition, commercial reagents and completely domesticated tree
shrews are very limited. Therefore, tree shrew is not a suitable experimental

investigate whether wild tree shrews in nature are infected by or asymptomatic
carrier of SARS-CoV-2.

Figure 1. Study design and body temperature in SARS-CoV-2 infected
tree shrews. (A) Total 24 tree shrews (Tupaia belangeris ) were divided into
three groups (young, adult and old) according to ages. Each group included
half male and half female. Each of tree shrew was inoculated with 1ml 106 pfu
SARS-CoV-2 nasally (500ul/each) in 0 dpi. Every other day body temperature
was monitored. At the same time, nasal, throat, anal and blood samples were
collected for analysis of viral loads. On 14 and 16 dpi, animals were
euthanatized and necropsied. Gross lesions were recorded and tissue
samples were collected for further analysis. (B) On every other day as
indicated in (A), body temperature of tree shrew was monitored and recorded.
The software Graphpad was utilized for data processing and plotting as
rainbow heat map. X represents no data collected. Body temperature beyond
39
was shown in white boxes.

Figure 2. Histopathological examination of affected tissues from SARS-CoV-2
infected tree shrews. On 14 and 16 dpi, tree shrews were euthanized and
necropsied. Seventeen tissues were collected from each animal for
histopathological analysis. From eight old tree shrews, eleven tissues with
various degrade of pathological changes were representatively shown. Green
arrows indicate the pathological changes described in text. Histopathology of
all other tree shrews was summarized in Table 2.
