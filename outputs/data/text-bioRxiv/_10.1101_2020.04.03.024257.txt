Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus currently causing a pandemic. We show
that the majority of amino acid positions, which differ between SARS-CoV-2 and the
closely related SARS-CoV, are differentially conserved suggesting differences in
biological behaviour. In agreement, novel cell culture models revealed differences
between the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Moreover, cellular ACE2
(SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and TMPRSS2 (enables virus entry via S protein cleavage)
levels did not reliably indicate cell susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV further differed in their drug sensitivity profiles. Thus, only drug testing
using SARS-CoV-2 reliably identifies therapy candidates. Therapeutic concentrations
of the approved protease inhibitor aprotinin displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. The
efficacy of aprotinin and of remdesivir (currently under clinical investigation against
SARS-CoV-2) were further enhanced by therapeutic concentrations of the proton
pump inhibitor omeprazole (aprotinin 2.7-fold, remdesivir 10-fold). Hence, our study
has also identified anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy candidates that can be readily tested in
patients.

Introduction
In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2, a novel betacoronavirus, was identified that
causes a respiratory disease and pneumonia called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID19) [Chen et al., 2020; Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses, 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et
al., 2020]. The first cases seemed to have originated from a wholesale fish market in
Wuhan, China [Zhu et al., 2020]. As of 3rd April 2020, this novel virus has resulted in
1,041,126 confirmed infections and 55,132 deaths in 181 countries and regions
(www.who.int) [Dong et al., 2020].
SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect and cause disease in
humans alongside the alphacoronaviruses human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E)
and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63, New Haven coronavirus) and the
betacoronaviruses human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human coronavirus
HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV),
and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [Corman et al., 2018;
Yin and Wunderink, 2018; Cui et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020b]. HCoV-229E, HCoVOC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 are endemic in humans and typically cause mild
to moderate common cold-like respiratory disease [Channappanavar & Perlman,
2017; Corman et al., 2018].
Since 2002, SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus, after SARS-CoV and MERSCoV, that has caused a substantial outbreak associated with significant mortality [Wu
et al., 2020b]. According to WHO, the SARS-CoV outbreak resulted in 8,098 confirmed
and suspected cases and 774 deaths, equalling a mortality rate of 9.6%
(www.who.int). For MERS-CoV, the WHO currently (2nd April 2020) reports 2,494
laboratory-confirmed cases and 858 deaths (mortality rate: 34.4%) (www.who.int).
However, human-to-human spread of MERS-CoV remains very limited. SARS-CoV-2
disease is associated with a lower mortality. Currently, about 5.3% of individuals with
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection have died, and the risk of severe disease increases
with age [Dong et al., 2020; CDC COVID-19 Response Team, 2020]. This mortality
level is likely to be an overestimation. A mortality rate of 1% or less may be more
realistic, because patients with severe symptoms are more likely to be tested, while
mild and asymptomatic cases are likely to go unreported [Borges do Nascimento,
2020; Nishiura et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020; Rothe et al., 2020]. In contrast to SARSCoV-infected patients, SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be spread by individuals
who are asymptomatic during the incubation period or who do not develop symptoms
at all [Li et al., 2020; Nishiura et al., 2020; Nishiura et al., 2020a; Pan et al., 2020;
Rothe et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020]
We have developed an approach to identify sequence-associated phenotypic
differences between related viruses based on the identification of differentially
conserved amino acid sequence positions (DCPs) and in silico modelling of protein
structures [Pappalardo et al., 2016; Martell et al., 2019]. Here, we used this method to
identify differentially conserved positions that may explain phenotypic differences
between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV [Coronaviridae Study Group of the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al.,
2020]. These findings were analysed in combination with data from cells infected with
a recently derived SARS-CoV-2 isolate [Hoehl et al., 2020]. Our results reveal
characteristic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Most importantly,
we found that therapeutic concentrations of the protease inhibitor aprotinin interfere
with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The efficacy of aprotinin can be further increased by
therapeutic concentrations of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole.

Results
Determination of differentially conserved positions (DCPs)
Coronavirus genomes harbour single-stranded positive sense RNA (+ssRNA)
of about 30 kilobases in length, which contain six or more open reading frames (ORFs)
[Cui et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020b; Wu et al., 2020b]. The SARSCoV-2 genome has a size of approximately 29.8 kilobases and was annotated to
encode 14 ORFs and 27 proteins [Wu et al., 2020b]. Two ORFs at the 5’-terminus
(ORF1a, ORF1ab) encode the polyproteins pp1a and pp1b, which comprise 15 nonstructural proteins (nsps), the nsps 1 to 10 and 12-16 [Wu et al., 2020b]. Additionally,
SARS-CoV-2 encodes four structural proteins (S, E, M, N) and eight accessory
proteins (3a, 3b, p6, 7a, 7b, 8b, 9b, orf14) [Wu et al., 2020b]. This set-up resembles
that of SARS-CoV. Notable differences include that there is an 8a protein in SARSCoV, which is absent in SARS-CoV-2, that 8b is longer in SARS-CoV-2 (121 amino
acids) than in SARS-CoV (84 amino acids), and that 3b is shorter in SARS-CoV-2 (22
amino acids) than in SARS-CoV (154 amino acids) [Wu et al., 2020b].
To identify genomic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV that
may affect the structure and function of the encoded virus proteins, we applied an
approach that we have previously used to compare the human pathogenic
Ebolaviruses species with Reston virus, an Ebolavirus that does not cause disease in
humans [Pappalardo et al., 2016; Martell et al., 2019]. This methodology is based on
the determination of differentially conserved positions (DCPs) [Rausell et al., 2010],
i.e. amino acid positions that are differently conserved between phenotypically
different groups, in our case related viruses. The potential impact of the DCPs on
protein structure and function is then determined by in silico modelling [Pappalardo et
al., 2016; Martell et al., 2019].
For the 22 SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins that could be compared with SARS-CoV,
comparison of the two reference sequences identified 1393 positions that encode
different amino acids. 1243 (89%) of these positions were DCPs (Table 1), which
represents 13% of all residues encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Most of the
amino acid substitutions at DCPs appear to be fairly conservative as demonstrated by
the average BLOSUM substitution score of 0.49 (median 0; Supplementary Figure 1)
and with 73% of them having a score of 0 or greater (the higher the score the more
frequently such amino acid substitutions are observed naturally in evolution). It
followed that 45% of DCPs represent conservative changes where amino acid
properties are retained (e.g. change between two hydrophobic amino acids), a further
30% represented polar - hydrophobic substitutions, while changes between charged
amino acids were rare (<10% of DCPs) (Supplementary Table 1).
DCPs are enriched in six of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, spike (S), 3a, p6, nsp2,
nsp3 (papain-like protease) and nsp4 with 19.4%, 21.5%, 28.6%, 28.6%, 21.3% and
18.8% of their residues being DCPs respectively (Table 1). In contrast, very few DCPs
were observed in the envelope (E) protein and most of remaining non-structural
proteins encoded by ORF1ab, for example 0.5% of residues in the helicase and 2%
of residues in the RNA-directed RNA polymerase, 2’-O-Methyltransferase, nsp8 and
nsp9 are DCPs (Table 1).
The availability of structures of both SARS-CoV and some SARS-CoV-2
proteins, coupled with the ability to model some of the remaining proteins (ref to
methods and supplementary table) enabled us to map 525 DCPs onto protein

structures (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Table 1). Overall, nearly all of the
mapped DCPs occur on the protein surface (92%), with only 40 DCPs buried within
the protein, primarily in S and the papain-like protease (nsp3) (Supplementary Table
1). Based on our structural analysis, we propose that 45 DCPs are likely to result in
structural (or functional) differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
A further 222 could result in some change, with our analysis suggesting that the
remaining 258 DCPs seem unlikely to have a substantial effect on protein structure
and function.
Differentially conserved positions (DCPs) in interferon antagonists
At least 10 SARS-CoV proteins have roles in interferon antagonism [Totura and
Baric, 2012]. Two of these proteins, p6 and the papain-like protease (nsp3), are
enriched in DCPs, two are depleted in DCPs (nsp7 and nsp16), five have intermediate
proportions of DCPs (nsp14, nsp1, nsp15, N and M), while p3b is not encoded by
SARS-CoV-2. Initial studies have identified a difference in the interferon inhibition
between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [Lokugamage et al., 2020], so it is possible

that the DCPs identified in these proteins, especially in p6 and the papain-like
protease, may have an effect on interferon inhibition.
S (Spike) protein
The most interesting changes were detected in the spike (S) protein, which
mediates coronavirus entry into host cells [Cui et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020b]. SARSCoV-2 S is 77.46% sequence identical to the SARS-CoV S and most of the remaining
positions are DCPs (243 residues, 1%) (Table 1). SARS-CoV entry depends on the
cleavage of S by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), the endosomal
cysteine protease cathepsin L, and/ or other cellular proteases, with residues R667
and R797 being critical cleavage sites [Matsuyama et al., 2010; Simmons et al., 2013;
Zhou et al., 2015; Reinke et al., 2017; Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019]. Serine protease
inhibitors such as camostat and nafamostat interfere with S cleavage by TMPRSS2
and virus uptake [Kawase et al., 2012; Yamamoto et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2015; Shin
& Seong, 2017]. R667 and R797 are conserved in SARS-CoV-2 (R685 and R815).
However, there is a four amino acid insertion in SARS-CoV-2 S prior to R685 and
many of the residues close to R685 are DCPs (V663=Q677, S664=T678, T669=V687,
S670=A688, Q671=S689, DCPs are represented by the SARS CoV residue followed
by the SARS-CoV-2 residue) (Figure 1A). There is greater conservation around the
R815 cleavage site with only two DCPs in close proximity (L792=S810, T795=S813)
(Figure 1A).
The SARS-CoV S receptor binding domain (residues 306-527, equivalent to
328-550 in SARS-CoV-2) is enriched in DCPs, containing 51 DCPs (23% of residues).
Eleven of the 24 SARS-CoV S residues in direct contact with ACE2 were DCPs (Figure
1A, Supplementary Table 2). Analysis of the DCPs using the SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 S protein complexes with ACE2 [Song et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2020] identified
runs of DCPs (A430-T433, F460-A471) in surface loops forming part of the S-ACE2
interface and resulted in different conformations in SARS-CoV-2 S compared to
SARS-CoV S (Figure 1B). Two DCPs remove intramolecular hydrogen bonding within
the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Table 2) and three DCPs
(R426=N439, N479=QQ493, Y484=Q498) are residues that form hydrogen bonds
with ACE2. For two of these positions, hydrogen bonding with ACE2 is present with
both S proteins, but for R426=N439 hydrogen bonding with ACE2 is only observed
with SARS-CoV S. N439 in SARS-CoV-2 S is not present in the interface and the
sidechain points away from the interface (Figure 1D). Further, analysis of the SARSCoV-2 S-ACE2 complex highlighted important roles of the V404=K417 DCP, where
K417 in SARS-CoV-2 S is able to form a salt bridge with ACE2 D30 (Figure 1C) [Yan
et al., 2020].
Alanine scanning [Chakraborti et al., 2005] and adaptation experiments [Wan
et al., 2020] have identified 16 SARS-CoV S residues associated with determining the
binding affinity with ACE2. For all five residues identified from adaptation studies and
four of the 11 identified by alanine scanning epxeriments different amino acids are
present in SARS-CoV-2 S (Figure 1E), highlighting the difference in the interaction
with ACE2.

SARS-CoV-2 replication in different cell lines
In further experiments, we investigated to see the extent to which the
substantial number of amino acid positions that are differently conserved between
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, result in different phenotypes. Infection experiments
using the four colorectal cancer cell lines Caco2, CL14, HT-29, and DLD-1 resulted in
similar susceptibility profiles. Replication of both viruses was detected in Caco2 and
CL14 cells, but not in HT-29 or DLD-1 cells, as shown by cytopathogenic effects (CPE)

and CL14 cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection [Cinatl et al., 2004] and the
previous isolation of SARS-CoV-2 cells in Caco2 cells [Hoehl et al., 2020]. Moreover,
we identified CL14 as an additional model to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and
replication.

SARS-CoV-2 infection does not correlate with the cellular ACE2 status
Although ACE2 was identified as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor [Hoffmann et al.,
2020; Letko et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yan
et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020], there was no correlation between the cellular ACE2
levels and the cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 (and SARS-CoV) (Figure 3A).
CL14 cells displayed lower ACE2 levels than both HT-29 and DLD-1 (Figure 3A),
although CL14 was, in contrast to HT-29 and DLD-1, permissive to SARS-CoV-2 (and
SARS-CoV) infection (Figure 2). This suggests that there are other factors in addition
to the cellular ACE2 levels that determine cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV.

ACE2 expression mediates 293 cell susceptibility to SARS-CoV but not to SARSCoV-2
Next, we compared SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication dependence on
ACE2 in an additional model. 293 cells are not susceptible to SARS-CoV infection due
to a lack of ACE2 expression. However, 293 cells that stably express ACE2
(293/ACE2) support SARS-CoV infection [Kamitani et al., 2006]. As expected,
infection of 293 cells with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 did not result in detectable
cytopathogenic effect (CPE) (Figure 3B), but a SARS-CoV-induced CPE was detected
in 293/ACE2 cells (Figure 3B). In contrast to SARS-CoV, however, 293/ACE2 cells
displayed limited permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 3B). Staining for
double-stranded RNA (Figure 3C) and detection of viral genomic RNA copies (Figure
3D) confirmed reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection of and replication in 293/ACE2 cells
relative to SARS-CoV. These findings further suggest that there are differences in the
host cell factors that mediate SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and in turn
differences in the cell tropisms.
Reduced activity of anti-ACE2 antibody against SARS-CoV-2 compared to
SARS-CoV
Antibodies directed against ACE2 have been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV
replication [Li et al., 2003]. In agreement, an anti-ACE2 antibody inhibited SARS-CoV
infection in Caco2 cells (Figure 3E). However, the anti-ACE2 antibody displayed
limited activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 3E). This is in agreement with
previous findings indicating a stronger binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S to ACE2
compared to SARS-CoV S [Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020], which may be more
difficult to antagonise using anti-ACE2 antibodies. As anticipated, antibodies directed
against DPP4, the MERS-CoV receptor [de Wit et al., 2016; Cui et al., 2019], did not
interfere with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 3E).
SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive to TMPRSS2 inhibitors than SARS-CoV
SARS-CoV S and SARS-CoV-2 S are cleaved and activated by TMPRSS2
(transmembrane serine protease 2) [Matsuyama et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2020;
Matsuyama et al., 2020]. Notably, all four cell lines, which we had tested for
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 replication, displayed similar TMPRSS2 levels (Figure
3A). Hence, cellular permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2 infection is determined by further
host cell factors in addition to TMPRSS2 and ACE2.
Previous findings had shown that the serine protease inhibitor camostat, which
is approved for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis in Japan [Ramsey et al., 2019],
inhibits both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry via interference with TMPRSS2mediated S cleavage [Kawase et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2015; Hoffmann et al., 2020].
Camostat inhibited cell entry of VSV pseudotypes bearing SARS-CoV-2 S in a
concentration-dependent manner [Hoffmann et al., 2020]. Control experiments using
wild-type virus were only performed using a single high camostat concentration of 100
µM. Here, we directly compared the concentration-dependent effects of camostat on

SARS-CoV-2- and SARS-CoV-induced CPE formation in Caco2 cells (Figure 4A).
Camostat displayed nearly 14-fold increased activity against SARS-CoV-2
(concentration that inhibits CPE formation by 50%, IC50 1.20µM) compared to SARSCoV (IC50 16.7µM) (Figure 4A). Nafamostat is an alternative serine protease inhibitor,
which is approved for pancreatitis and [Minakata et al., 2019; Hirota et al., 2020] and
has been shown to exert superior effects against MERS-CoV compared to camostat
[Yamamoto et al., 2016].
Nafamostat displayed higher activity against SARS-CoV-2 CPE formation (IC50
0.49µM) than camostat, but similar activity against SARS-CoV (18.9µM) (Figure 4A).
Therapeutic plasma levels for both compounds were described to reach about 0.2µM
[Hiraku et al., 1982; Cao et al., 2008], which is below the antivirally active
concentrations. Moreover, although both compounds inhibited SARS-CoV-2-induced
CPE formation, they displayed limited effects on the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle as
indicated by high levels of double-stranded RNA in both nafamostat- and camostattreated SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Figure 4B). Hence, both camostat and nafamostat
may primarily exert cytoprotective effects in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, which inhibit
syncytium formation and cell lysis, but may not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in the
same way.

nafamostat prevent SARS-CoV-2-mediated cell lysis but are characterised by high
levels of double-stranded RNA.
Aprotinin is a further serine protease inhibitor that has been previously
investigated against influenza viruses [Zhirnov et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2017]. It is
used to reduce blood loss during surgery and for pancreatitis [Moggia et al., 2017;
Kapadia et al., 2019]. The efficacy of aprotinin is measured in kallikrein inhibitor units
(KIU) [Levy et al., 1994; Zhirnov et al., 2011]. Like the other seine protease inhibitors,
aprotinin was also more effective against SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE formation (IC50
22.9 KIU/mL) than against SARS-CoV (IC50 118 KIU/mL) (Figure 4A). In addition and
in contrast to nafamostat and camostat, aprotinin also inhibited double-stranded RNA
formation in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Figure 4B). Therapeutic aprotinin plasma
levels were described to reach 147 ± 61 KIU/mL after the administration of 1,000,000
KIU [Levy et al., 2019]. Moreover, an aerosol preparation of aprotinin is approved for
the treatment of influenza in Russia [Zhirnov et al., 2011]. Since aprotinin interferes
with SARS-CoV-2 in therapeutic concentrations and displays more pronounced direct
antiviral effects than camostat and nafamostat, it seems to have a greater potential for
the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals based on our data.
Testing of additional antiviral drug candidates
To investigate whether there are also differences in the drug sensitivity profiles
of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV to other antiviral drug candidates, we tested two
further compounds (Figure 4A). Previous research had shown that
hydroxychloroquine and ammonium chloride interfere with SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 replication, as lysosomotropic agents that increase the pH in lysosomes [Talbot
and Vance, 1980; Randolph and Stollar, 1990; Touret and de Lamballerie, 2020; Wang
et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020]. Proton pump inhibitors including omeprazole may
also inhibit virus replication by lysosomotropic and/ or other mechanisms [Dowall et
al., 2016; Strickland et al., 2017; Watanabe et al., 2020]. Thus, we included
omeprazole in our study. Moreover, we tested remdesivir, a drug that was developed
for the treatment of flavivirus infections and displayed activity against a range of RNA
viruses [Beigel et al., 2019; Hoenen et al., 2019]. Most recently, remdesivir was found
to inhibit MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and suggested as a therapy candidate for
SARS-CoV-2 infection [de Wit et al., 2020; Sheahan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020].
Currently (as of 31st March 2020), there are eight active clinical trials investigating
remdesivir for SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals (www.clinicaltrials.gov). Omeprazole
inhibited both viruses in similar concentrations, and SARS-CoV was more sensitive to
remdesivir than to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 4A). Both omeprazole and remdesivir also
inhibited the formation of double-stranded RNA (Figure 4B)
Omeprazole increases the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of remdesivir and aprotinin
Omeprazole is a well-tolerated drug and a promising candidate for drug
repurposing strategies [Ikemura et al., 2017]. However, the omeprazole
concentrations that interfered with SARS-CoV-2 CPE formation (IC50 34µM) was
beyond therapeutic omeprazole plasma concentrations reported to reach about 8µM
[Shin & Kim, 2013]. We have recently shown that omeprazole increases the antiviral
activity of acyclovir [Michaelis et al., 2019]. Here, we combined both aprotinin and
remdesivir with a fixed omeprazole concentration of 8µM, which resulted in further
increased activity against CPE formation (aprotinin 2.7-fold, remdesivir 10-fold)
(Figure 5A) and double-stranded RNA formation (Figure 5B). Hence, combinations of

Discussion
Here, we performed an in-silico analysis of the effects of differentially
conserved amino acid positions (DCPs) between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
proteins on virus protein structure and function in combination with a comparison of
wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in cell culture.
Our analysis identified 1243 DCPs, which represents 89% of the amino acid
positions that differ between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and nearly 13% of all
residues encoded by the SARS-CoV genome. 258 of these DCPs (2.6% of all
residues) are likely to have a structural and functional impact. The DCPs are not
equally distributed between the proteins. DCPs are enriched in S, 3a, p6, nsp2,
papain-like protease, and nsp4, but very few DCPs are present in the envelope (E)
protein and most of the remaining non-structural proteins encoded by ORF1ab. This
indicates that the individual proteins differ in their tolerance to sequence changes and/
or their exposure to selection pressure exerted by the host environment.
This large proportion of DCPs reflects the differences in the clinical behaviour
of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. The mortality associated with SARS-CoV is
substantially higher than that associated with SARS-CoV-2 (www.who.int) [Dong et
al., 2020; Nishiura et al., 2020a; Pan et al., 2020; Rothe et al., 2020]. While SARSCoV causes a disease of the lower respiratory tract, and infected individuals are only
contagious when they experience severe symptoms [de Wit et al., 2016], SARS-CoV2 is present in the upper respiratory tract and seems to be readily transmitted via
droplets and direct contact prior to the onset of symptoms. Moreover, mild but
infectious cases may substantially contribute to its spread [Li et al., 2020; Rothe et al.,
2020; Yang et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020]. Further research will be required to elucidate
in detail, which DCPs are responsible for which differences in virus behaviour.
However, we have already identified a number of differences between SARSCoV-2 and SARS-CoV, with regard to their cell tropism and drug sensitivity profiles.
Both viruses use ACE2 as a receptor and are activated by the transmembrane serine
protease TMPRSS2 [Li et al., 2003; Matsuyama et al., 2010; Cui et al., 2019;
Hoffmann et al., 2020; Letko et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Matsuyama et al., 2020; Wals
et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020; Wetko et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020;
Zhou et al., 2020]. Our results show, however, that the ACE2 and the TMPRSS2 status
are not sufficient to predict cells susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV. We
found that the colorectal cancer cell line CL14 supported SARS-CoV-2 replication,
although it displayed lower ACE2 levels and similar TMPRSS2 levels to the nonsusceptible cell lines DLD-1 and HT29. Hence CL14 represents a novel additional
model for the studying of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Notably, attempts to identify SARSCoV-2 target cells based on the ACE2 status [Luan et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020; Xu
et al., 2020] need to be considered with caution in the light of our current findings.
As previously described [Kamitani et al., 2006], ACE2 expression rendered
SARS-CoV non-permissive 293 cells susceptible to SARS-CoV. However, the effects
of ACE2 expression had a substantially lower impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection,
indicating differences in other host cell determinants of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
susceptibility. Moreover, an anti-ACE2 antibody displayed higher efficacy against
SARS-CoV than against SARS-CoV-2. This may be explained by an increased SARSCoV-2 S affinity to ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV S [Wrapp et al., 2020], which may
be more difficult to antagonise.
The serine protease inhibitors camostat, nafamostat, and aprotinin inhibited
both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV CPE formation. In contrast to aprotinin, camostat,

and nafamostat exerted limited activity against double-stranded RNA formation in
SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. This may indicate that camostat and nafamostat rather
exert cytoprotective effects that prevent cells from virus-induced lysis but less
pronounced antiviral activity. The mechanisms underlying the enhanced anti-SARSCoV-2 activity of aprotinin remain unclear. Differences in the interference with
additional proteases involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication may be responsible. Notably,
aprotinin had been identified in the past as a protease inhibitor with pronounced
antiviral activity, which may interfere with viral proteases in addition to cellular ones
[Hayashi et al., 1991; Aleshin et al., 2007; Zhirnov et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2017].
Notably, SARS-CoV-2 was more sensitive to aprotinin than SARS-CoV, which
may be at least in part explained by the DCPs observed in the vicinity of the cleavage
sites in S. Effective aprotinin concentrations were in the range of clinically achievable
concentrations. Moreover, aprotinin aerosols, which may result in increased local drug
concentrations in the lungs are approved for the treatment of influenza viruses in
Russia [Zhirnov et al., 2011]. Remdesivir, a broad spectrum antiviral agent under
investigation in clinical trials for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients
(www.clinicaltrials.gov), exerted stronger effects against SARS-CoV than against
SARS-CoV-2.
Therapeutic concentrations of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole further
increased the activity of aprotinin and remdesivir. Omeprazole may interfere with the
acidification of the lysosomes, which is required to support coronavirus replication
[Shen et al., 2017]. However, other, so far unknown, mechanisms may also contribute
to this. Notably, omeprazole and other proton pump inhibitors have recently been
shown to increase the anti-herpes simplex virus activity of acyclovir [Michaelis et al.,
2019].
In conclusion, our in-silico study revealed a substantial number of differentially
conserved amino acid positions in the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV proteins. In
agreement, cell culture experiments identified differences in the cell tropism and drug
sensitivity profiles of these two viruses. Our data also show that cellular ACE2 levels
do not reliably indicate cell susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Hence, ACE2 expression
studies are not sufficient to predict the SARS-CoV-2 cell tropism. Differences in the
drug sensitivity profiles between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the most closely
related coronavirus known to have caused disease in humans, indicate that
approaches to identify anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs will require testing against this virus.
Finally, and probably most importantly during an ongoing pandemic, we have shown
that the approved drug aprotinin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinically achievable
concentrations. The efficacy of aprotinin (and of remdesivir, which is investigated
against SARS-CoV-2 in clinical trials) can be further enhanced by therapeutic
concentrations of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole. Hence, our study has
identified novel candidate therapies based on approved drugs that can be readily
tested in a clinical setting.

Methods
Structural analysis
Full genome sequences for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) 4 and the GISAID resource. A total of
1266 full length genome sequences were available as of 27/03/2020. Fifty-three
SARS-CoV genome sequences were downloaded from VIPR [Pickett et al., 2012;
Pickett et al., 2012A] restricted to sequences with a collection year between 20032004 and a human or unknown host. Where the host was unknown the genome
information was further checked to see if it was appropriate. Open Reading Frames
(ORFs) were extracted using EMBOSS getorf [Rice et al., 2000]. These ORFs were
matched to known proteins using BLAST, and fragments and mismatches were
discarded. To match the ORF1ab non-structural proteins, a BLAST database of the
sequences from the SARS non-structural proteins was generated and the SARS-CoV2 ORF1ab searched against it. After each ORF was assigned to a known protein they
were aligned using ClustalO [Sievers et al., 2011] with default settings. Sequences
that fell below 50% coverage were removed from analysis.
SDPs were identified by calculating the Jensen-Shannon divergence [Capra &
Singh, 2007] score for each position in the multiple sequence alignment in each
species. Highly conserved alignment positions where the conservation score was >0.8
for both species were retained. Any of alignment positions where the same amino acid
occurred in both species were then removed. The remaining residues, were
considered SDPs.
All available SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV protein structures were downloaded
from the protein Databank (PDB) [Armstrong et al., 2020]. Where structures were not
available they were modelled using Phyre2 [Kelley et al., 2015] (Supplementary Table
4). SDPs were mapped onto protein structures using PyMOL from structures obtained
from the Protein Databank (PDB). To model the complex between the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein and ACE2, a model of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was built using
Phyre2 based on the SARS-CoV structure (PDB:6acg) as some of the residues
involved in binding by the SARS-CoV spike protein were not resolved in the SARSCoV-2 spike protein structure. This homology model was docked to ACE2 using
HADDOCK with constraints based on the likely interface residues equivalent to the
SARS-CoV complex.
Cell culture
The Caco2 cell line was obtained from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). The
cells were grown at 37°C in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10%
foetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. 293
cells (PD-02-01; Microbix Bisosystems Inc.) and 293/ACE2 cells [Kamitani et al., 2006]
(kindly provided by Shinji Makino, UTMB, Galveston, Texas) were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS), 50 IU/ mL
penicillin, and 50µg/ mL streptomycin. Selection of 293/ACE2 cells constitutively
expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was performed by
addition of 12 µg/ mL blasticidin. All culture reagents were purchased from Sigma
(Munich, Germany). Cells were regularly authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR)
analysis and tested for mycoplasma contamination.

Virus infection
The isolate SARS-CoV-2/1/Human/2020/Frankfurt was derived from an
individual, who had been evacuated from the Hubei province in China, transferred to
University Hospital Frankfurt, and tested positive for SARS-CoV [Hoehl et al., 2020]
and cultivated in Caco2 cells as previously described for SARS-CoV strain FFM-1
[Cinatl et al., 2004]. Virus titres were determined as TCID50/ml in confluent cells in 96well microtitre plates [Cinatl et al., 2003; Cinatl et al., 2005].
Western blot
Cells were lysed using Triton-X-100 sample buffer, and proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE. Detection occurred by using specific antibodies against βactin (1:2500 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany), ACE2, and TMPRSS2 (both
1:1000 dilution, abcam, Cambridge, UK). Protein bands were visualised by laserinduced fluorescence using infrared scanner for protein quantification (Odyssey, LiCor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA).
Receptor blocking experiments
To investigate whether ACE2 or DPP4 receptors are involved in SARS-CoV-2
internalisation and replication, Caco2 cells were pre-treated for 30 min at 37°C with
goat antibody directed against the human ACE2 or DDP4 ectodomain (R&D Systems,
Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany). Then, cells were washed three times with PBS
and infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.01. Cytopathogenic effects were monitored
48h post infection.
Antiviral assay
Confluent cell cultures were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in 96-well plates at MOI
0.01 in the absence or presence of drug. Cytopathogenic effect (CPE) was assessed
visually 48h post infection [Cinatl et al., 2003].
Viability assay
Cell
viability
was
determined
by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay modified after Mosman [Mosmann, 1983],
as previously described [Onafuye et al., 2019]. Confluent cell cultures in 96-well plates
were incubated with drug for 48h. Then, 25 µL of MTT solution (2 mg/mL (w/v) in PBS)
were added per well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 4 h.
After this, the cells were lysed using 200 µL of a buffer containing 20% (w/v) sodium
dodecylsulfate and 50% (v/v) N,N-dimethylformamide with the pH adjusted to 4.7 at
37 °C for 4 h. Absorbance was determined at 570 nm for each well using a 96-well
multiscanner. After subtracting of the background absorption, the results are
expressed as percentage viability relative to control cultures which received no drug.
Drug concentrations that inhibited cell viability by 50% (IC50) were determined using
CalcuSyn (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).
qPCR
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RNA from cell culture supernatant samples was
isolated using AVL buffer and the QIAamp Viral RNA Kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Absorbance-based quantification of the RNA yield was performed using the
Genesys 10S UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). RNA was subjected to

OneStep qRT-PCR analysis using the Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (New
England Biolabs) and a CFX96 Real-Time System, C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler.
Primers were adapted from the WHO protocol29 targeting the open reading frame for
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp): RdRP_SARSr-F2 (GTG ARA TGG TCA
TGT GTG GCG G) and RdRP_SARSr-R1 (CAR ATG TTA AAS ACA CTA TTA GCA
TA) using 0.4 µM per reaction. Standard curves were created using plasmid DNA
(pEX-A128-RdRP) harbouring the corresponding amplicon regions for RdRP target
sequence according to GenBank Accession number NC_045512. For each condition
three biological replicates were used. Mean and standard deviation were calculated
for each group.
Immunostaining for double-stranded RNA
Immunostaining was performed as previously described [Cinatl et al., 1995],
using a monoclonal antibody directed against double-stranded RNA (1:150 dilution,
SCICONS J2, mouse, IgG2a, kappa chain, English & Scientific Consulting Kft., Szirák,
Hungary) 48h post infection.
