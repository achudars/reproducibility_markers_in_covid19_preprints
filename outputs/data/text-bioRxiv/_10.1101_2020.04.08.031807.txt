Abstract
COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has recently been announced
as a pandemic all over the world. Plenty of diagnostic, preventive and
therapeutic knowledges have been enriched from clinical studies since
December 2019. However, animal models, particularly non-human primate
models, are urgently needed for critical questions that could not be answered
in clinical patients, evaluations of anti-viral drugs and vaccines. In this study,
two families of non-human primates, Old world monkeys (12 Macaca mulatta,
6 Macaca fascicularis) and New world monkeys (6 Callithrix jacchus), were
experimentally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical signs were recorded.
Samples were collected for analysis of viral shedding, viremia and
histopathological examination. Increased body temperature was observed in
100% (12/12) M. mulatta, 33.3% (2/6) M. fascicularis and none (0/6) of C.
jacchus post inoculation of SARS-CoV-2. All of M. mulatta and M. fascicularis
showed chest radiographic abnormality. Viral genomes were detected in nasal
swabs, throat swabs, anal swabs and blood from all 3 species of monkeys.
Viral shedding from upper respiratory samples reached the peak between day
6 and day 8 post inoculation. From necropsied M. mulatta and M. fascicularis,
the tissues showing virus positive were mainly lung, weasand, bronchus and
spleen. No viral genome was seen in any of tissues from 2 necropsied C.
jacchus. Severe gross lesions and histopathological changes were observed
in lung, heart and stomach of SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. In summary, we
have established a NHP model for COVID-19, which could be used to
evaluate drugs and vaccines, and investigate viral pathogenesis. M. mulatta is
the most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, followed by M. fascicularis and
C. jacchus.
One Sentence Summary:
M. mulatta is the most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to
M. fascicularis and C. jacchus.

INTRODUCTION
The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection,
was firstly reported in Wuhan, Hubei China in December 20191. About one
month, this severe disease attracted international attentions and declared as
a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30,
2020. Within 4 months, COVID-19 unexpectedly spread to 195 countries and
regions, led to more than 1 million confirmed cases in the world and was
defined as a pandemic disease. It is believed to be the second largest
infectious disease since 1918 flu2. Clinicians and scientists have been globally
collaborating to investigate this disease and its pathogen, such as diagnosis,
prevention and treatment of COVID-193, genome and structure of SARS-CoV24. However, there are still many critical questions remaining, which are hard
to be answered in clinic studies. For example, how do SARS-CoV-2 transmit?
What is viral pathogenesis? What about vaccines and drugs against SARSCoV-2? Therefore, animal models are urgently expected to be established for
this severe COVID-19. Although several models of COVID-19 have recently
been reported5-7, including the non-human primate model, none of model
should be considered to be the best one, depending on what questions we
are going to answer with the animal models. About 16 years ago, the nonhuman primate models recapitulated several important aspects of SARS 8-11.
These models made great contributions to investigation of SARS
pathogenesis, evaluation of antiviral drugs and vaccine 12. Though COVID-19
is different from SARS in some aspects, pathogens for these two diseases
share some characters, such as ACE2 receptor. Here, to establish the
COVID-19 model, two families including 3 species of non-human primates,
which are widely used for animal models with their own advantages and
disadvantages, were experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2, followed by
comparisons of clinical symptoms, hematology, biochemical indexes,
immunology and histopathology among 3 species. We found that both
Macaca mulatta (M. mulatta) and Macaca fascicularis (M. fascicularis) of old
world monkeys were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, although M.
mulatta was more susceptible to viral infection than M. fascicularis. However,
Callithrix jacchus (C. jacchus), a new world monkey, was relatively resistant to

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, as the model of COVID-19, M. mulatta and
M. fascicularis may be chosen for further exploration of viral pathogenesis,
evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and vaccines.
RESULTS
Given that host factors may be involved in viral pathogenesis, we designed an
experiment in the present study to investigate whether host genetics, age and
gender affect SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-human primates (Figure 1). Two
families of non-human primates, old world monkeys (12 M. mulatta, 6 M.
fascicularis) and new world monkeys (6 C. jacchus), were chosen for this
experiment after screening and randomly grouped based on species, age and
gender (Figure 1). Animals in large size (4 adults and 4 old M. mulatta, 6 M.
fascicularis) were inoculated with 4.75x106 pfu of SARS-CoV-2 via 3 routines
(intratreachuslly 4.0ml, intranasally 0.5ml and intra 0.25ml). Half dosage of the
viruses was given to 4 young M. mulatta via the same 3 routines. Six C.
jacchus were inoculated with 1.0x106 pfu intranasally.
Clinical signs of SARS-CoV-2 infected monkeys
Animals were monitored daily and sampled at the indicated time points before
and after viral inoculation (Figure 1). Increased body temperature (BT) (above
38

℃) was continuously observed in 100% (12/12) M. mulatta, 33.3% (2/6) M.

fascicularis and none (0/6) of C. jacchus post inoculation of SARS-CoV-2. BT
of 7/12 M. mulatta reached the first peak on day 4-6 post inoculation (dpi) and
maintained above 38

℃ for several days. The highest BT was 40.9 ℃ during

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of M. fascicularis, their BT didn't change as much as
those of M. mulatta. And duration of BT>38

℃ in M. fascicularis was shorter

than M. mulatta (Figure 2A).

On 0 and 10 dpi, body weight (BW) of experimental animals (C. jacchus not
determined) was checked on electronic balance. As compared to BW on day
0, nine out of 12 M. mulatta showed the decreased BW with declined range of
5.88%-28.57%. Eighty-three percent (5/6) of M. fascicularis lost BW by 2.1710.51% (Table 1).

Chest radiographs of infected animals (M. mulatta and M. fascicularis, not C.
jacchus due to their small size) were recorded every other day post virus
inoculation. From the beginning of 10 dpi, abnormalities at various degrees
appeared in lungs of all M. mulatta and M. fascicularis. The texture of the two
lungs is increased and thickened, and scattered in small patches (Figure 2B).
Overview of the chest radiograph throughout this study showed that
progressive pulmonary infiltration was noted in all M. mulatta and M.
fascicularis (Supplemental Figure 1).
Replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the non-human primates
To know dynamics of viral replication and virus shedding, samples of nasal
swabs, throat swabs, anal swabs, feces, blood and tissues were collected at
the indicated time points, and SARS-CoV-2 genomes were quantitated by RTqPCR. Swab samples collected on 2 dpi from M. mulatta and M. fascicularis
showed surprisingly high levels of viral genome RNA, particularly in nasal
swabs. Most of swab samples saw the second peaks of viral RNA on 6-8 dpi.
In some swab samples from old world monkeys, viral RNA was still detectable
on 14 dpi (Figure 3A). Less viral RNA were detected in throat swabs,
compared to nasal swabs and anal swabs. In contrast to M. mulatta and M.
fascicularis, lower levels of viral RNA were detected in swab samples from C.
jacchus during two weeks post viral inoculation (Figure 3B). Virus shedding in
feces from 8 out of 18 old world monkeys started on 6 dpi. Notably, higher
levels of viral RNA were detected in feces from SXH6, HHH6, HHH11 and
HHH12, from which anal swabs also gave correspondingly higher number of
viral RNA. In peripheral blood, 8/18 old world monkeys and 6/6 new world
monkeys had viral RNA detectable on 2 dpi. After 6 days, blood samples from
nearly all old world monkeys became viral RNA-positive. On 10 dpi, viral RNA
was not detectable in blood samples from almost all (23/24) of experimental
monkeys (Figure 3A).

Viral load of SARS-CoV-2 was determined in tissue samples from 8 animals
necropsied on 4 dpi (HHH13), 7 dpi (HHH14), 12 dpi (HHH8), 13 dpi (SXH-1,
RH2, RH5) and 15 dpi (HHH3, HHH12). RT-qPCR with SARS-CoV-2 specific

primers and probes was performed to quantitate copy number of viral
genomic RNA. No viral RNA was detected from all tissues of two C. jacchus.
We could detect higher level of viral genomes in the tissue of bronchus and
weasand from 3 necropsied M. mulatta and relatively lower level of viral RNA
in one M. fascicularis. Spleens from HHH12 and SXH1 gave middle levels of
viral RNA. No viral RNA was detected in other tissues. Furthermore, viral RNA
and spike protein in tissue samples were confirmed in lung, trachea and
bronchus by RNA hybridization RNAscope and immunofluorescent assay
(Figure 3D and Figure 3E). Under TEM, no viral particle was observed in the
ultrathin sections of lungs and other tissues.
Host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection
To determine the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we firstly
performed comprehensive analyses of peripheral blood and serum samples
collected at the indicated time points post infection. Blood complete test (BCT),
blood clotting assay (BCA), flow cytometric assay (FCA) were conducted to
evaluate the anti-coagulated whole blood harvested every other day post viral
inoculation. Twenty-three parameters of whole blood in BCT were assayed,
related to white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC) and platelets. BCT
results showed a slight and irregular changes during infection, which indicated
no clinical meaning. In BCA, three parameters of PT-R, PT-T, PT-INR
progressively decreased with infection, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection
may affect blood coagulation function (data not shown). Three major
populations of immune cells in RBC-depleted peripheral blood were
differentially and dynamically analyzed via flow cytometry. In M mulatta,
regardless of ages, frequencies of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, monocytes
peaked on 2 or 4 dpi, and then gradually declined. Young M mulatta showed
the strongest B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection among 3 ages of
monkeys, but they had the similarly changing trends (peaked on 2 or 4 dpi
and maintained at a certain level) (Figure 4A). M. fascicularis showed the
similar dynamics of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells and monocytes in
blood post SARS-CoV-2 infection, of which no significant difference between
male and female animals (Figure 4B). In SARS-CoV-2 infected monkeys,
serum samples were collected for assay of biochemistry indexes related with

liver functions, heart/muscle functions, kidney functions, blood lipids, humoral
immune responses, and stresses (data not shown). Unfortunately, we could
not find any biochemistry index that could be a biomarker of SARS-CoV-2
infection correlated with functions of key organs.

Humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated in viral
S protein-coated ELISA plates. Virus-specific antibodies became detectable
as early as 4 dpi in both species of old world monkeys. In the following week,
some animals showed a peak level of virus-specific antibodies. In the other
animals, antibody levels gradually increased until the end of experiment (21
dpi) (Figure 4C). On 30 dpi, we still observed that antibody levels in 2 M.
mulatta (one adult HHH-6 and one old HHH-11) and one M. fascicularis (adult
female SXH-6) kept increasing (data not shown). One of old M. mulatta hadn’t
produce detectable virus-specific antibody within 21 days of experiment.
However, young M. mulatta showed overall lower levels of virus-specific
antibodies compared with those in adult and old M. mulatta. Adult M.
fascicularis gave the comparable or slightly higher levels of antibodies than
young M. mulatta. No difference of antibody level was noted between SARSCoV-2 infected male and female M. fascicularis (Figure 4D). We couldn’t
detect virus-specific antibodies in serum samples from infected C. jacchus
probably due to lack of cross-reactivity of antibody detection kit with samples
from C. jacchus.

Furthermore, host inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection were
assessed via non-human primate multiplex inflammatory cytokines assay.
Twenty-three inflammatory cytokines in serum samples from M. mulatta and
M. fascicularis were quantitated and dynamically analyzed at the indicated
time points. We found that eight cytokines (G-CSF, IL-1A, IL-8, IL-15, IL-18,
MCP-1, MIP-1B, sCD40-L), among 23 cytokines assayed, were detected in
most of animals. Especially, expression of sCD40-Lwas beyond the upper
limitation of detection in most of tested samples (data not shown). IL-10 was
only induced in monkeys of HHH-11 and SXH-6 on 4 dpi. In addition, IL-1A,
IL-8, IL-15 and MCP-1 were strikingly induced in HHH-11 and SXH-6 and
peaked on 2 or 4 dpi. Monkey HHH3 produced a peak of IL-15, IL-18 and

MCP-1 on 2 dpi after SARS-CoV-2 infection, followed by gradual decline.
Second peaks of some cytokines occurred at the late stage of experiment
(Figure 4E & 4F).

Finally, in order to further investigate histopathogical responses to SARSCoV-2 infection, we necropsied 8 animals on 4 dpi (HHH-13), 7 dpi (HHH-14),
12 dpi (HHH-8), 13 dpi (SXH-1, RH-2, RH-5), 15 dpi (HHH-3 and HHH-12).
Severe gross lesions were observed on lung, heart and stomach of M. mulatta
and M. fascicularis, but not C. jacchus. The main gross lesions involved
massive pulmonary punctate haemorrhage, swollen Hilar and mediastinal
lymph nodes, pericardial effusion, and swollen Mesenteric lymph nodes
(Figure 5A). Histopathological analysis showed that thickening of the
pulmonary septum and infiltration of inflammatory cells, diffuse hemorrhage
and necrosis in M. mulatta. Exudate, a small number of lymphocytes and
neutrophils were found in some blood vessels of M. mulatta liver, and some
hepatocytes were swollen, with multiple vacuole like cells (mild) steatosis. The
structure of spleen was clear, the number of germinal centers increased
significantly, and capillary hemorrhage occurred in paracortical area. The
number of germinal centers of mesenteric lymph nodes significantly increased.
The space of renal vesicle space was widened and some glomeruli were
atrophied. In M. fascicularis, histopathological changes in the respiratory
system were similar to those examined in M. mulatta. Hyperplasia of
mesenteric lymph nodes was observed in M. fascicularis. Mild infiltration of
local inflammatory cells was also examined in the kidney of infected M.
fascicularis. C. jacchus showed slight infiltration of inflammatory cells into the
broken pulmonary septum with some necrotic cells. The hepatocytes were
swollen. Light hemorrhage was observed in spleen, the germinal center of
which is in actively proliferative condition (Figure 5B). Furthermore,
ultrastructural examination under transmission electronic microscope was
conducted on 70-80nm ultrathin sections. Although we didn’t find viral
particles in any of examined tissues, typical ultrastructural lesions were
observed in lung (increased type II pneumocytes, red blood cells and
macrophages in alveolar airspace) and heart (increased number of
mitochondria in the myocardium, loose arrangement of muscle fibers and

the results from microscopic inspection.

DISCUSSIONS
SARS-CoV-2, recently reported as another novel coronavirus escaping from
Pandora’s box after16 years 13, leaves us not just many mysteries but also
hopes in its jar. Animal models of COVID-19, particularly non-human primate
models, will give us hopes to uncover many mysteries of SARS-CoV-2 and
COVID-19. Since December of 2019, scientists all over the world have been
working to establish animal model of COVID-19. So far there are several
models reported in preprinted journals or peer-reviewed published journals,
including two small murine models (hACE2 transgenic mouse14 and Gold
Syrian hamster15), one ferret model16 and four non-human primate models
(three M. mulattta models5-7, one M. fascicularis model17). Due to differences
of viral isolates, challenging routes, and animal species, controversial results
or conclusions were drawn in these reported models of COVID-19. In this
study, our comparative study of SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrates that M.
mulatta is the most susceptible animal to viral infection among 3 species of
non-human primates, followed by M. fascicularis and C. jacchus. Age and
gender may not affect the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in these monkeys. The
non-human primate model in this study recapitulates several clinical features
of COVID-19.

Retrospective studies of clinical features of COVID-19 show that older
patients have more severe diseases, which may be associated with
comorbidities, including tumor, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, heart
diseases and so on18-20. These underlying diseases may make senior
patients more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and worsen COVID-19.
However, animals in this study were screened prior to experiments and
supposed to be no severe complications/comorbidities and relatively healthy
with normal immunity. This may explain that no matter age and gender within
one species, monkeys showed similar susceptibility and responses to SARSCoV-2 infection.

Monitoring body temperature is one of critical steps to define COVID-19
suspected patients, which leads to the conclusion that fever is the most
common in COVID-19 patients, counting for more than 85% of all
inpatients3,18,21. Here, all SARS-CoV-2 inoculated M. mulatta had increased
body temperature at some time points with a peak of 40.9

℃. One-third of M.

fascicularis and C. jacchus had a slightly elevated body temperature.
Nevertheless, this manifestation could not be defined as fever since we don’t
have the physiological body temperature of various species of monkeys as a
reference.

The other important clinical feature of COVID-19 is abnormal changes of
chest radiograph from X-ray and CT22, which is generally considered to be
direct evidence for pneumonia. Ground glass opacities (GGO) were seen in
40%-70-89.6% of COVID-19 patients, followed by consolidation (13-33.9%)
and other abnormal radiographs18,21,23,24. In this study, all animals (C. jacchus
not determined) began to show progressively abnormal chest radiograph
(Figure 2B and Supplemental Figure 1) from the 10th day after virus
inoculation, which simulates COVID-19 to some extent. In order to confirm
results of chest radiographs, we played a very important match game and
found that in some cases, gross lesions on lungs observed after necropsy
strikingly matched abnormal spots of chest radiographs collected right before
necropsy.

Laboratory routine assays include BCT, BCA, biochemistry indexes, flow
cytometric analysis, results of which could be used to evaluate patients’ health
and immune status. More than 50% COVID-19 patients have lymphopenia
and/or esoinopenia, indicating their immunity may be affected by viral
infection3,18,25. High levels of D-dimer, CRP, procalcitonin and ALT are
assayed in severe patients, which suggests abnormal functions of liver and
blood coagulation26-28. By flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood from M.
mulatta and M. fascicularis in the present study, we showed the changes and
trends of T cells, B cells and monocytes after viral infection (Figure 4B),
indicating that host immune responses were induced by SARS-CoV-2

infection29. However, our results from the other laboratory assays did not
correlate with clinical indexes.

Detection of viral genomic RNA is the most important evidence for diagnosis
of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dynamic analysis of virus shedding will be
beneficial for treatment and control of COVID-19. Comparative studies of
large amount of clinical samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients
demonstrate that 93% bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were viral RNA
positive, followed by sputum (72%), nasal swabs (63%), feces (29%) and
blood/serum (1%)30. In samples from upper respiratory track, nasal swabs
had higher levels of viral RNA than those in throat swabs30. SARS-CoV-2
RNA in nasal swabs was detectable at the onset of disease, and peaked on
day 2 post onset of disease. After that, it began to decline slowly, and usually
last for about 2 weeks31. In the present study, dynamics of virus shedding in
the NHP was similar to that reported in COVID-19 patients, although some
minor disparities existed due to differences between disease onset in patients
and viral inoculation time in animals. On day 2 post viral inoculation, there
was an unusual peak of viral genome RNA in nasal swabs (Figure 3A). We
speculated that this may be the left-over of viral nucleic acid from viral
inoculation, but not from replicating viruses since it sharply declined on 4 dpi.
The real peak of detectable RNA from replicating viruses should be from 6 dpi
to 8 dpi in nasal swabs from infected animals. In addition, detectable viral
RNA in anal swabs and expression of ACE2 in digestive tract of patients with
covid-19 suggest that fecal-oral routine has a great potential risk in the
transmission of SARS-CoV-232. In this study, we noticed that high level of
virus shedding via feces lasted for a long time in 4 monkeys of animal model
(Figure 3A).

Viral load in various tissues, as an indicator of tropism, correlates with viral
pathogenesis. Lung is widely considered to be the target organ for SARSCov-2 replication since plenty of viruses are detected in bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid from COVID-19 patients30. At the earlier stage of our animal
models, we could detect SARS-CoV-2 viral genomic RNA in lung and the
other respiratory tissues (Figure 3C). However, SARS-CoV-2 RNA became

negative in lung after 10 dpi, but was still detectable in weasand, and
bronchus. It is possible that inflammatory environment of lung may push
viruses out to other tissues.

Appearance of viral RNA in blood, out of lung, correlated with the severity
COVID-1933. We could detect viral RNA in blood samples from all of 24
monkeys, although there were some differences of viral load and lasting time
among individual animals. However, we couldn’t find the correlation between
blood viral RNA and severity of disease.

Finally, histopathology is the golden standard and very important for
evaluation of COVID-19 patients. So far, most of the clinical reports on the
pathological changes of covid-19 come from the aged patients with
comorbidities, focusing on lungs. Typical histopathology of pneumonia is
observed in COVID-19 patients in additional to mild inflammation in liver and
heart 34. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, M. mulatta and M. fascicularis, but not C.
jacchus, showed severe histopathological changes in lung as pneumonia, and
inflammation in liver and heart.

In conclusion, the NHP model in this study simulates several important
aspects of COVID-19. Using this model, we should further explore
pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in order to answer some critical remaining
questions in clinics, such as the refractory patients, cytokine storm, antibodies
against SARS-CoV-2, and so on. And this model is suitable for preclinical
evaluation of anti-viral drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

Viral stock of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained from the Center of Diseases Control,
Guangdong Province China. Viruses were amplified on Vero-E6 cells and
concentrated by ultrafilter system via 300kDa module (Millipore). Amplified
SARS-CoV-2 were confirmed via RT-PCR, sequencing and transmission
electronic microscopy, and titrated via plaque assay (106 pfu/ml).
Animals and experimental procedures
Three species of monkeys from two families of primates (old world monkeys
and new world monkey) were used for this study. Detailed information about
experimental animals was shown in Figure 1A.
Animal groups and experimental schedules were outlined in Figure 1A.
Referring to the NHP model of SARS, we inoculated old world monkeys with
total 4.75ml of 106 pfu/ml SARS-CoV-2 intratracheally (4ml), intranasally
(0.5ml) and on conjunctiva (0.25ml), new world monkeys with 1.0ml
intranasally. Animals were daily checked for clinical sign and body
temperature. At the indicated time points in Figure 1A, we anaesthetized
animals with ketamine and performed the following experimental procedures.
Every other day post inoculation, we took chest radiography of animals,
harvested peripheral blood to prepare samples of whole blood or serum, and
collected nasal, pharyngeal, and rectal swabs in 800ul Trizol LS solution
(Invitrogen, US) for further analysis. Monkeys with severe signs were chosen
for necropsy and pathological changes of all organs were recorded and
evaluated at gross, histological and ultrastructural levels.

Chest X-ray image of each anaesthetized monkey was taken with 55-75v and
8-12.5mA every other day using Mobile digital medical X-ray photography
system (MobileCooper, Browiner China). Data was evaluated and scored
double-blindly and independently by two radiologists.
Quantification of viral genome in swabs, feces or tissue samples
400 ul of Trizol LS-treated and inactivated samples was used for RNA
extraction according to the Direct-zol™ RNA MiniPrep protocol (ZYMO
RESEARCH CORP, US). 50 μl of DNase/RNase-Free Water was used to
elute RNA. Real time RT-PCR was used to quantify viral genome in samples
using TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (ThermoFisher, US) and purified
viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 as a standard curve, performed on CFX384 Touch
Real-Time PCR Detection System (Biorad, US). Conditions for RT-PCR were

℃ for 2min, 50℃ for 15min, 95℃ for 2min, then 40 cycles
at 95℃ 5sec and 60℃ 31sec. Primers and probe, specific for NP gene was
synthesized according to sequences reported by China CDC, Target-2-F：

Hematology
Blood was collected in the tube containing anti-coagulant from inguinal veins
of anaesthetized animals for Blood Clotting Test (BCT), Complete Blood
Count (CBC) and flow cytometric analysis. BCT was conducted according to
the manufacture-recommended protocol (Sysmex CA-600, Japan). Items in
BCT includes Fbg sec, Fgb C, PT%, PI-INR, PT-R, PT-T, TT-T and APTT-T.
CBC was performed on Auto Hematology Analyzer (BC-5000 Vet,
Mindray,China), including white blood cells-related (numbers and percentages
of Neu, Lym, Mon, Eos, Base), red blood cells-related (RGB, HCT, MCV,
MCH, MCHC, RDW-CV) and platelet-related items (PLT, MPV, PDW, PCT).
Flow cytometric analysis was conducted on Cytoflex (Backman, USA) using
florescent-labelled antibodies against cellular surface marker CD45, CD3,

CD4, CD8, CD14. Briefly, 50 ul of whole blood was incubated with proper
fluorescent-labelled antibodies for 30min in dark at room temperature. 450 ul
of 1x RBC Lys solution (BD) was added to the antibody-blood mixture and
incubated for 15min at room temperature to remove red blood cells, which
was ready for analysis on Cytoflex machine.
Blood biochemical indexes
Non anti-coagulant blood from inguinal veins of anaesthetized animals was
collected for serum preparation. Biochemical indexes in serum were
measured on the automatic biochemistry analyzer (KHB ZY-1280, Shanghai
Kehua Bio-engineering, China) using commercial kits, including liver functionrelated (TP, ALB, GLB, A/G, TB, DB, IBIL, ALT, AST, ALP), kidney functionrelated (BUN, UA, Cr), blood lipid-related (TC, TG, HDL, LDL, AP0A1, AP0B,
LP(a)), heart muscle-related (CRE-E, LDH, α-HBDH, CK, CK-MB), humeral
immunity-related (IgM, IgG, IgA, C3 and C4), and others indexes (GLU, CRP).

Histological evaluation
For paraffin-bedded sections, tissues were collected and fixed in 10% neutralbuffered formalin, embedded in paraffin. 5 um sections were prepared for
haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, RNAscope or immunofluorescent
staining. The whole H&E slide was scanned via 3D HISTECH system,
evaluated by a pathologist double-blindly.

For ultrastructural sections, tissues were successively fixed in 2.5%
glutaraldehyde and 1% osmium tetroxide solution. After gradual dehydration
in various concentrations of ethanol, tissues were embedded in epoxy resin
and cut into 60-70nm sections. After stained with 2% uranium acetate,
ultrathin sections were examined under Hitachi transmission electron
microscope H-7650.
Localization of viral RNA in tissues
A novel nucleic acid hybridization technique RNAscope was performed to
detect and localize viral RNA in paraffin-embedded tissue sections using
SARS-CoV-2 specific probe (RNAscope® Probe- V-nCoV2019-S, ACD, Cat

No. 848561, targeting the region of 21631 – 23303 (NC_045512.2) of SARSCoV-2 genome). FFPE slides were pretreated by baking, de-paraffinizing,
target retrieval and protease treatment. SARS-CoV-2 specific probe was
applied to the pretreated slides and hybridized with viral genome. Fluorophore
was added to detect the hybridization on slides, followed by counter-staining
with DAPI. Slides were scanned via 3D HISTECH system for further analysis.
Virus-specific antibody response
Levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in serum samples were evaluated
via the commercially available SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Assay Kit (ELISA)
(Cat#XG100H2, China). In this kit, viral spike protein was coated in each well
of 96-well plate to capture spike-specific antibodies. HRP-conjugated goat
anti-human IgG (H+L) antibody was added to detect the captured spikespecific antibodies. Data was plotted via the software GraphPad.
Multiplex analysis of cytokines in serum
MILLIPLEX MAP Non-Human Primate Cytokine Magnetic Bead Panel Immunology Multiplex Assay (PRCYTOMAG-40K, Millipore USA) were used in
this study to assay 23 inflammatory cytokines according to the manufacturer’s
protocol, which was performed on Bio-plex machine. Inflammatory cytokines
in this panel included IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6,IL-8/CXCL8,G-CSF,GM-CSF,IFN-
