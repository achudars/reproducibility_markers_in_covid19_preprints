Abstract

21

Respiratory infections by RNA viruses are one of the major burdens upon global health and economy.

22

Viruses like influenza or coronaviruses can be transmitted through respiratory droplets or contaminated

23

surfaces. An effective antiviral coating can decrease the viability of the virus particles in the outside

24

environment significantly, hence reducing their transmission rate. In this work, we have screened a series

25

of nanoparticles and their composites for antiviral activity using Nano Luciferase based highly sensitive

26

influenza A reporter virus. Using this screening system, we have identified copper-graphene (Cu-Gr)

27

nanocomposite shows strong antiviral activity. Extensive material and biological characterization of the

28

nanocomposite suggested a unique metal oxide embedded graphene sheet architecture that can inactivate

29

the virion particles only within 30 minutes of pre-incubation and subsequently interferes with the entry of

30

these virion particles into the host cell. This ultimately results in reduced viral gene expression, replication

31

and production of progeny virus particles, slowing down the overall pace of progression of infection. Using

32

PVA as a capping agent, we have been able to generate a Cu-Gr nanocomposite based highly transparent

33

coating that retains its original antiviral activity in the solid form.

Introduction

37

The emergence of novel virus strains and the associated outbreaks are becoming a significant threat to

38

mankind (Koven 2020). The currently ongoing pandemic, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory

39

Syndrome- Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has brought the majority of the world to a grinding halt, severely

40

impacting health & economy across the nations (Letko, Marzi, and Munster 2020). So far, the COVID-19

41

pandemic has claimed 720,000 lives resulting from 19.4 million infections globally. This reminds us of the

42

great 1918 Spanish flu pandemic by the influenza virus, which resulted in 500 million infections with 50

43

million deaths (Johnson and Mueller 2002) (Patterson and Pyle 2019) (Taubenberger and Morens 2006)

44

(Landrigan et al. 2018). Till date, there have been four worldwide pandemics caused by influenza viruses

45

in the last century (1918, 1957, 1968, 2009) (World Health Organization 2018) (Saunders-Hastings and

46

Krewski 2016), while Covid19 is the first pandemic caused by the Coronavirus (Y. Wu et al. 2020). Other

47

than pandemics, influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal outbreaks (290,000 to 650,000 deaths worldwide:

48

CDC FLUVIEW] and different coronaviruses cause mild flu-like symptoms to severe respiratory infections

49

(SARS (De Wit et al. 2016) and MERS (Lin et al. 2019) coronavirus epidemics during 2002 and 2012

50

respectively) (Fehr and Perlman 2015). Clearly, recurring respiratory infections caused by these viruses

51

are becoming one of the global human health problem.

52
53

Both influenza and coronaviruses cause respiratory infections, which can be transmitted from infected to

54

healthy individuals through respiratory droplets, aerosols or contacts. These respiratory pathogens are

55

known for their ability to persist on inanimate surfaces for days and even up to months, depending upon

56

weather conditions (Vasickova et al. 2010). As a result, touching contaminated surfaces in public places is

57

a potential route of viral transmission. In fact, the inanimate surfaces have been identified as a major cause

58

of infections, especially in institutions where individuals are in contact with patients or contaminated

59

fomites. Thus, the development of low cost and easily scalable antiviral coating materials, which could be

60

widely applied to various surfaces in order to inactivate the virus particles in the environment, may serve

61

as an effective way to reduce the chance of infection and hence to lower the overall speed of transmission.

62
63

Different metal oxides, including Cu and Ag have been explored for their biocidal activity in soluble as

64

well as in insoluble forms (Minoshima et al. 2016) . Copper and silver nanoparticles have remarkable

65

properties like high electrical and thermal conductivity (Barani et al. 2020; D. Deng et al. 2013), superior

66

catalytic nature (Gawande et al. 2016), anti-fungal (Cioffi et al. 2005) and bacteriostatic activities (Ruparelia

67

et al. 2008) to name a few. Solid-state cuprous oxide and silver nitrate have been shown to inactivate virus

68

particles through interfering with the activity of the surface antigen, hemagglutinin (HA), thereby blocking

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.02.279737; this version posted September 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

69

the attachment of the virus to the host cell receptors (Fehr and Perlman 2015) (Sunada, Minoshima, and

70

Hashimoto 2012). Cuprous oxide nanoparticles had also been shown to inhibit the attachment and entry

71

stages of Hepatitis C Virus infection, hence suggesting a generic mechanism for the copper-based

72

nanoparticles for their antiviral activities (Hang et al. 2015). This may also explain the lesser viability of

73

infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles on copper surfaces (8 h) when compared to stainless steel and plastic

74

surfaces (72 h) (Neeltje van Doremalen et al. 2020). Biological activity of the Cu or Ag nanoparticles largely

75

depends upon their size, shape, stability and capping agent. Due to the high reactivity of these nanoparticles,

76

they can undergo rapid agglomeration leading to the drastic reduction of their activity (Ma et al. 2011). One

77

way to overcome this instability is to form a composite with other organic or inorganic compounds which

78

stabilizes the nanoparticles by altering their surface architecture (Perdikaki et al. 2018).

79
80

Graphene is composed of a single atom thick sheet of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms that forms a honeycomb

81

lattice (Mohammed et al. 2020; Palmieri and Papi 2020). This structure of graphene is responsible for its

82

large surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, strong mechanical strength and unique physicochemical

83

properties (Edwards and Coleman 2013; Eigler and Hirsch 2014; Novoselov et al. 2012). It is used

84

extensively in the field of nano-medicine due to easy surface functionality and controlled selectivity (Park

85

et al. 2020). In recent times, the two dimensional sheet of graphene has caught much attention due to its

86

antimicrobial and antiviral activity (Georgakilas et al. 2012). Differentially functionalized graphene oxide

87

sheets can warp and encapsulate microorganisms, thereby severely restricting their interaction with host

88

cells (Perdikaki et al. 2018) (Vinothini and Rajan 2017) (Karahan et al. 2018). For example, sulfate

89

functionalized reduced graphene oxide has been shown to interact with the positively charged surface

90

proteins of different orthopoxvirus strains (Ziem et al. 2016) (Ye et al. 2015). In this work, we have

91

performed an extensive investigation of the potential antiviral activity of copper (Cu) nanoparticles, silver

92

(Ag) nanoparticles, graphene (Gr) and their hybrid versions (nanocomposite materials) Ag-graphene, Cu-

93

graphene and Ag-Cu-graphene against respiratory viruses using influenza A virus as a model system. Our

94

data shows that prior incubation with the colloidal Cu-Gr nanocomposite can impose a strong reduction in

95

viral infectivity, which gets manifested in the reduced viral entry, gene expression and subsequent

96

production of progeny virions. Extensive material characterization using UV-Visible absorption and Raman

97

spectroscopy along with X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) reveals a unique architecture of copper oxide decorated

98

two-dimensional graphene sheets. The shape, size and distribution of the hybrid nanoparticles were also

99

studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX).

100

Finally, we have developed for the first time a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) based copper-graphene

101

nanocomposite coating, which is completely transparent and shows strong antiviral activity in the solid

102

phase.

Results

105

Synthesis and preliminary characterization of the nanoparticles and nanocomposites

106

We have synthesized various nanoparticles and their hybrids using a simple and cost-effective chemical

107

method as discussed in the experimental section. The synthesized materials are Cu nanoparticles, Ag

108

nanoparticles, graphene (Gr) and their hybrid versions Ag- graphene, Cu- graphene and Ag-Cu-graphene

109

(Figure 1 A, B). Visible absorption spectra of each of these variants confirms the presence of respective

110

components either alone or in combination with their composite partners, as shown in Figure 1C and D. The

111

peak at 418 nm confirms the formation of Ag colloidal nanoparticles (Jin et al. 2005). From literature, it is

112

attributed to Surface Plasmon Resonance with spherical nature (Hu et al. 2013). From the UV-vis spectra

113

of the composite Ag-Gr, Plasmon absorption band at around 410 nm, indicates the formation of a hybrid

114

structure. Incorporation of Ag nanoparticles on graphene sheets had led to a blue shift of the surface

115

plasmon resonance, a characteristic similar to previous reports (Kim et al. 2018).

116

Furthermore, Cu nanoparticles, due to exposure of air at room temperature, goes through surface oxidation,

117

which is the reason that samples contain oxygen in +1 and +2 states forming CuO or Cu2O (Yao et al.

118

2005). Composite including both Ag and Cu nanoparticles were also analyzed from the absorption

119

spectrum. A broad graphene peak was observed at 280 nm in the composite. Both Ag and Cu nanoparticle

120

plasmon peaks were observed and confirmed the presence of the colloidal nanoparticles on graphene sheets

121

(Darabdhara et al. 2017). Particularly, Figure 1D shows the absorption spectra of the composites and it

122

confirms the formation of graphene and CuO/Cu2O nanoparticles. An absorption peak at 262 nm is due to

123

π→π* transition in C=C bond of graphene. Another absorption band at~350-450 nm is attributed to the

124

intrinsic band to band transition of the CuO and Cu2O (Zhang et al. 2020). A blue shift was observed in the

125

peak position compared to bulk CuO; this might be due to the quantum confinement effects exhibited by

126

the particle when the size varies from bulk to nano. These UV-Vis peaks were well matched with CuO and

127

Cu2O absorption profiles from previous studies (Chan et al. 2007). A broadened plasmon resonance peak

128

for Cu-Gr nanocomposites is due to irregular shapes and sizes of the particles (Zhang et al. 2020).

129

Screening of nanoparticles and their hybrids for antiviral activity

130

To test the antiviral activity of synthesized nanomaterials and their composites we have used a

131

bioluminescent reporter variant of the influenza A virus, strain A/H1N1/WSN/1933, that has been

132

previously reported by Tran et al. (Tran et al. 2013). This virus has a Nano-Luciferase (NLuc) gene fused

133

to the carboxy-terminal of the viral PA gene, interspaced by the “self-cleaving” 2A peptide encoding

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.02.279737; this version posted September 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

134

sequence from porcine teschovirus. The Nano-Luc-influenza A reporter virus, as a part of its gene

135

expression, synthesizes the PA-2A-NLuc polypeptide, which gets self-cleaved to produce Nano-luciferase.

136

Subsequently, the luciferase activity could be measured as a quantitative estimate of viral gene expression

137

and hence progression of virus replication cycle inside the cells. To test whether the Nano-luciferase activity

138

could actually serve as a proxy to virus replication, we have infected MDCK cells with different amounts

139

of input virus and viral replication/gene expression was monitored using Nano-Glo assay (Promega). As

140

shown in Figure 3A, there is a linear relationship between multiplicity of infection (0.01-0.1) and luciferase

141

light unit measurements (R2= 0.9294), where an increase in one log in the input virus amount leads to about

142

50% increase in the luciferase activity or vice versa, measured at 8 hours of post-infection. This data

143

suggests that the Nano-luciferase influenza A reporter virus could serve as an excellent tool to study the

144

antiviral activity of various nanoparticles or their nanocomposites used in this study.

145

In order to test the antiviral activity, we have standardized a “Nano-Luc reporter assay” described in Figure

146

3B. Briefly, Nano-luciferase influenza A reporter viruses were pre-incubated with the 5uM colloidal

147

suspensions of each of the nanoparticles/ composites or with the vehicle control for 30 minutes at room

148

temperature and subsequently used to infect MDCK cells at an MOI of 0.1. Luciferase activity was

149

measured at 8 hours of post infection and plotted as a relative percentage of the vehicle control set (Figure

150

3C). Prior treatment of the virus stock solution with Cu-Gr composite showed 64% reduction in viral gene

151

expression, while prior treatment with Ag-Gr resulted in 20% reduction. Treatment with other materials

152

shows no significant decrease in luciferase activity. From the correlation of input virus units and the

153

corresponding luciferase activity, as shown in Figure 3A, it can be inferred that prior treatment with Cu-Gr

154

solution resulted in more than 10-fold reductions in the infectious virus population that has been used to

155

infect the MDCK cells. In this context, it should be noted that none of the materials showed substantial

156

cytotoxicity upon Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells (MDCK) within the concentration range of 0.5 uM -

157

5.0 uM as evaluated using MTT assay (Figure 2). Hence, the reduction in Nano-luciferase activity as a

158

result of prior exposure to Cu-Gr should be attributed exclusively to the reduction of the infectivity of the

159

Nano-luciferase reporter virus. Henceforth, we focused upon the extensive characterization of the Cu-Gr

160

nanocomposite.

161
162

Material characterization of Cu-Gr nanocomposite

163

We have extensively characterized the structural parameters of the synthesized Cu-Gr nanocomposites by

164

optical measurements. Figure 4 A depicts Raman spectra of synthesized Cu-Gr nanocomposite samples at

165

excitation of 532 nm in the range of 200 cm-1 to 3000 cm-1. With Raman spectroscopy, we are able to

166

distinguish both pristine graphene and copper peaks. The presence of D peak (1361 cm-1) and G peak (1527

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.02.279737; this version posted September 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

167

cm-1) confirms the existence of graphene in the samples synthesized. Generally, D peak originates from

168

defects in the hexagonal sp2 carbon system while the G peak arises due to the stretching vibration of sp2

169

carbon pairs in both rings and chains (Ferrari et al. 2006). Except, D and G peak, the 2D peak arises at

170

~2700 cm-1. The 2D peak originates due to transverse optical (TO) phonons around the K point and is

171

activated by triple resonance Raman scattering (TRRS) (J. Bin Wu et al. 2018). In the measured Raman

172

spectra (Figure 4B), three peaks are (280 cm-1, 350 cm-1 and 654 cm-1) observed to confirm the formation

173

of oxide of Cu and originate due to the first order phonon scattering. The peaks are assigned to Ag and 2Bg

174

peaks of copper oxide (Y. Deng et al. 2016). The graphene sheets are also seen in the optical images, as

175

shown in the inset of Figure 4 A. Figure 4B shows the XRD patterns of graphene, CuO, and Cu2O

176

nanoparticles, which confirm the crystalline phase of composites samples (standard JCPDS file number 35–

177

0505, 80–1917). Interestingly, the intensity of the Cu2O is more intense compared to that of the CuO peaks,

178

suggesting a higher abundance of Cu2O on the surface of the graphene sheets. No diffraction peaks

179

corresponding to impurities are observed in the patterns.

180
181

Extensive characterization of antiviral property of Colloidal Cu-Gr nanocomposite

182

Followed by the material characterization, we have invested significant efforts for the characterization of

183

the antiviral property of the Cu-Gr nanocomposites in its colloidal form. First, we have used the Nano-Luc

184

reporter assay in order to identify the optimal time and concentration required for its antiviral activity. The

185

Nano-Luc reporter assay was performed where the influenza A reporter virus was pretreated with the

186

colloidal form of the Cu-Gr nanocomposite for various time periods before using them for infecting MDCK

187

cells. As evidenced from Figure 5A, a sharp decrease (>50%) in the reporter activity was observed as a

188

result of 30 minutes of preincubation with Cu-Gr composite, while longer times of preincubation showed

189

only minor additional reduction. This data suggested that 30 minutes of preincubation with Cu-Gr

190

composite can lead to more than tenfold reduction in input virus titer that ultimately results in ~50%

191

decrease in reporter activity. Subsequently, we tried to identify the optimal concentration of the Cu-Gr

192

composite required for its antiviral activity. Different concentrations of the Cu-Gr composite (50nM,

193

100nM, 500nM, 1µM, 2µM and 5µM, respectively) were used to treat the Nano-Luc influenza A reporter

194

virus for 30 minutes followed by performing Nano-Luc reporter assay with the same. A precise dose

195

dependent decrease in reporter activity and hence virus replication was observed as a result of prior

196

treatment with Cu-Gr composite within the concentration range of 0.5mM to 5mM (Figure 5B). While

197

higher concentration (10µM) further reduced reporter activity, it may also show cytotoxicity upon the cells,

198

hence excluded from the subsequent experiment.

200

Next, we intended to test whether the reduction in the luciferase activity of the reporter virus, as a result of

201

pretreatment with Cu-Gr nanocomposite, can also be correlated to the reduction of progeny virus titer. A

202

non-reporter variant of the influenza A/H1N1/WNS/1933 virus was used for this purpose. Virus stock

203

solutions were either treated with two different concentrations of Cu-Gr nanocomposites (1µM and 5µM)

204

or with the vehicle control prior to infection on MDCK cells. Plaque assay was performed to measure the

205

titer of the progeny virus particles harvested at 8 hours of post-infection. There is about 40% decrease in

206

viral titer for the sets treated 5uM Cu-Gr solution with respect to the vehicle treated sets. Treatment with

207

1µM Cu-Gr nanocomposite shows non-significant decrease in viral titer. This data further substantiates the

208

fact that treatment with 5µM Cu-Gr significantly reduces viral infectivity which results in a decrease in

209

viral gene expression, replication and subsequent production of viral titer (Figure 5C). The plaque assay

210

titer data are tabulated in Figure 5D.

211
212

Prior treatment with Cu-Gr nanocomposite explicitly inhibits virus entry into the cells

213

At this point, we sought to examine the molecular mechanism by which Cu-Gr nanocomposite interferes

214

with virus replication cycle. Metal nanoparticles have been shown to interfere with the integrity of the virus

215

particles or the activity of the surface glycoproteins that may interfere with the entry of virus particles into

216

the host cells (Sunada, Minoshima, and Hashimoto 2012) (Ting Du. 2018). Hence, to investigate the effect

217

of pretreatment of Cu-Gr specifically upon virus entry step, we have performed an ‘entry assay’ (Figure

218

6A). The non-reporter variant of Influenza A WSN virus were either treated with Cu-Gr or with solvent

219

and subsequently used to infect MDCK cells in a synchronized fashion. Post entry, cells were incubated

220

with cycloheximide containing media for one hour to allow the import of the incoming viral

221

ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) into the nucleus. Subsequently, the incoming viral RNPs were stained

222

with antibodies specific to viral Nucleoprotein (NP), which is the major component of the RNPs. As shown

223

in the Figure 6 B, input viral RNPs are solely detected inside the nucleus of the infected cells irrespective

224

of the treatment. However, prior exposure to the Cu-Gr composite resulted in a significant reduction in the

225

number of NP positive cells. A quantitative analysis of 5 different fields with a total of 500 cells for both

226

treated and untreated sets shows roughly 80% decrease in number of NP positive cells in the Cu-Gr treated

227

set, with respect to the untreated one (Figure 6C). This data clearly suggests that exposure to Cu-Gr

228

nanocomposite compromises the ability of the virus particles to enter into the host cell, possibly by

229

impacting the structural integrity of the of the virion particles.

230
231

Development of a Cu-Gr nanocomposite based transparent coating with strong antiviral activity

232

The ability of Cu-Gr nanocomposite to reduce the infectivity of influenza A virus prompted us to test its

233

ability to inactivate influenza virus in the solid form. For this purpose, we have coated different wells of a

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.02.279737; this version posted September 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

234

48 well plate with a series of coating solutions containing different concentrations of Cu-Gr composite

235

(1µM, 5µM, 10 µM and 20 µM) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (1mm, 5mm, and 10mm) as a capping agent.

236

As a control, wells were coated with only PVA. This process generated a thin transparent film of Cu-Gr

237

nanocomposite onto the surface of each well. To test the antiviral activity of these films, defined amounts

238

of Nano-Luc influenza A reporter virus were inoculated in these coated wells and incubated for 30 minutes.

239

Post treatment, infectivity of these virus inoculums were tested on MDCK cells using the Nano-Luc reporter

240

assay as mentioned above. Prior exposure to the coating materials having various concentrations of Cu-Gr

241

composite blended in different amounts of PVA resulted in differential effects upon viral replication (Figure

242

7). Films containing different concentrations of Cu-Gr composite, either in absence or in presence 1mM

243

PVA barely showed any impact upon the infectivity of the virus. In contrast, an exact dose-dependent

244

decrease in viral gene expression was observed as a result of prior treatment with the films containing

245

increasing concentrations of Cu-Gr Composite in 5mM PVA. This antiviral activity was even more

246

pronounced (70% decrease in Nano-Luc activity) for the films containing 1-5uM of Cu-Gr with 10mM of

247

PVA. Together, this data shows 5uM of Cu-Gr composite capped with 10mM of PVA could be used to

248

generate a transparent coating with high antiviral activity.

249

Encouraged by the results mentioned above, we have used dip-coating method used to coat a tempered

250

glass with the Cu-Gr solution with optimum concentration. The glass unit was kept to soak the solution for

251

24 h and then air-dried naturally as shown in (Figure 8A). No formation of visibly aggregated spots or

252

clogging was observed on the glass surface. A clean, transparent screen was obtained, and when fixed on a

253

cell phone, there was no compromisation of light intensity or clarity of image on the display screen observed

254

(Figure 8B). Optical transmittance spectra confirm the transparency of the coating on glass substrates

255

(Figure 8C). As observed from the SEM images (Figure 8D), the Cu-O nanoparticles were uniformly

256

embedded on top of the graphene layer. Elemental analysis of Cu-Gr compounds was conducted by color

257

mapping and EDAX analysis. The data presented in the right panel of Figure 8D and Figure 8E confirmed

258

the presence of C, O, and Cu elements in the composites sample and their uniform distribution in the sample.

259

Figure 8F shows a schematic representation of the Cu2O and CuO nanoparticles embedded on the graphene

260

sheets with PVA as a binding agent.

RNA viruses constitute one of the broader families of human pathogens, including influenza, Nipah, Ebola,

264

SARS or MERS-Coronaviruses. Irrespective of their specific differences in virus replication cycle, all of

265

these viruses share broader structural similarities. The viral genomic RNA remains enwrapped with single

266

or multiple viral proteins and remains enclosed within the lipid bilayer envelope embedded with viral spike

267

proteins. The integrity of the lipid envelope and the functionality of the spike proteins are not only crucial

268

for the protection of the viral genomic materials in the outer environment but also indispensable for

269

conducting the first two steps of the virus life cycle that are “attachment” and “entry” (Jane Flint, Vincent

270

R 2015). In this study, we have identified Cu-Gr nanocomposite as a potential antiviral agent that can

271

interfere with these two steps of the influenza A virus life cycle, possibly through compromising the

272

structural integrity of the virion particles.

273

We, for the first time, have used a highly sensitive Nano-Luc reporter assay to perform an unbiased

274

screening of a series of nanoparticles and their composite materials in order to identify a coating substance

275

with strong antiviral activity. Our data identified Cu-Gr nanocomposite as the most potential antiviral agent.

276

Interestingly, Cu nanoparticles or graphene individually showed minimal or no antiviral activity in our

277

assay while a hybrid between these two showed at least ten-fold decrease in effective viral titer. This might

278

be due to the property of the composite substances, which is not just a hybrid between two materials in their

279

original state, but rather a combination of the modified version of the materials (Ramakrishnan et al. 2015).

280

This can also be substantiated from the previous studies showing metal-ion based composites shows better

281

activity compared to that of metal nanoparticles itself (Minoshima et al. 2016; Perdikaki et al. 2018; Sunada,

282

Minoshima, and Hashimoto 2012). Studies also reveal that the antiviral activity mainly depends on the

283

presence of ions generated from the surface of nanoparticles (Ma et al. 2011) (Shen et al. 2010). Our XRD

284

data clearly indicates the presence of various copper oxide species, Cu2O and CuO, embedded in the

285

graphene sheets which may serve as the basis for the antiviral activity of the composite material. The

286

presence of reactive oxygen species in CuxO-graphene sheets may provide ions, which may interfere with

287

the structural integrity of the lipid bilayer membrane or the surface antigens of the virion particles. This

288

interference should compromise the ability of the virus particles to interact with the cell surface receptor

289

essential for the attachment and subsequent entry into the host cell. Our entry assay supports this hypothesis,

290

as prior treatment with Cu-Gr composite resulted in significant reduction in the percentage of infection

291

positive cells with respect to the vehicle treated set.

292

Finally, we have used PVA as a capping agent and identified optimum concentrations of Cu-Gr and PVA

293

to develop a thin transparent coating with intense antiviral activity. While we have used dip-coating method

294

to coat a tempered glass with high visibility, other forms of coatings like doctor’s blade technique, spin

295

coating, and spray coating can also be implemented. Due to the high transmission efficiency, such coating

296

material could be implemented on a wide variety of surfaces, which could radically decrease the stability

297

of the virus particles in the outer environment and hence reduce the transmission rate drastically. Needless

298

to mention that such generic antiviral strategy can significantly reduce the overall burden of seasonal

303

Copper sulfate (CuSO4 > 99%), Silver nitrate (AgNO3 > 99%), Sodium borohydride (NaBH4 > 98%), Poly

304

vinyl alcohol (>99%), Sodium hydroxide pellets (NaOH > 97%) and graphite powder (>98%) were

305

purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

306
307

Cells, Viruses and Antibody: Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) (CCL-34) cells were maintained in

308

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% FBS at 37˚C and 5% CO2 along

309

with penicillin and streptomycin antibiotics (Gibco).

310
311

Influenza A virus strains, A/WSN/1933 (H1N1), WSN stably encoding PB2 with a C-terminal FLAG tag

312

(WSN-PB2-FLAG) (Dos Santos Afonso et al. 2005) or PA-2A-Swap-Nluc (PASTN) reporter virus based

313

on the strain A/WSN/33 (H1N1) were used for infecting the cells (Tran et al. 2013). Antibody used

314

includes anti-NP (H16-L10-4R5) (Yewdell et al., 1981).

315
316

Synthesis of materials:

317

Initially, the graphene dispersion was prepared using a liquid exfoliation of the graphite powder in

318

Deionized (DI) water (20 mg/300 mL) using an ultrasonic probe sonicator. Probe sonication of frequency

319

30 Hz was used in pulses for 2 hours. Silver (Ag) and Copper (Cu) stock solutions were prepared using

320

4mM AgNO3 (68 mg/100 mL) and 4 mM CuSO4 (63.8 mg/100 mL) in DI water medium respectively.

321

Graphene solution (45 mL) was mixed with 15 mL of Cu and Ag stock solution separately by maintaining

322

the pH=12 adjusted through NaOH. 20 mL of 4 mM NaBH4 (30 mg/200 mL) solution, a strong reducing

323

agent is added drop wise with the Cu-graphene (Cu-Gr), Ag-graphene (Ag-Gr) and Cu-Ag-graphene (Cu-

324

Ag-Gr) mixtures separately and stirred continuously at 40⁰C.

325

Furthermore, four different concentrations (1µM, 5µM, 10µM and 20µM) of Cu functionalized graphene

326

samples were synthesized for biological process optimization. Three different concentrations (1mM, 5mM

327

and10mM) of poly vinyl alcohol have been capped as a coating media for the Cu-graphene samples.

328
329

Material characterizations:

330

Different phases of the synthesized sample (Cu functionalized graphene) were obtained from the X-ray

331

diffraction (XRD) peaks by using Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer within a scan range of 2Theta

332

(2θ) values 7 and 90° with Cu-Kα source, maintaining the scan rate of 1° min-1. Absorption spectra of Cu-

333

graphene synthesized sample were recorded by a BioTek UV-vis spectrophotometer Epoch 2 microplate

334

within 200 nm to 800 nm wavelength. Raman shifts were measured by using WiTec –alpha 300R confocal

335

microscope at excitation of 532 nm in the wavenumber range of 200 cm-1 to 3000 cm-1. SEM images were

336

obtained through Zeiss-Merlin EVO 60 scanning electron microscope with Oxford EDS detector.

337
338

MTT assay:

339

MDCK cells were seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 15000 cells per well. The cells were treated with

340

Silver (Ag), Graphene (Gr), Copper (Cu) nanoparticles as well as Ag-Gr, Cu-Gr and Ag-Cu-Gr

341

nanocomposites respectively for 24 hours (h) at 37°C in 5% CO2. Cellular cytotoxicity assay was performed

342

according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, after 24 h of treatment with the nanoparticle, 100µl of

343

MTT reagent (5 mg/ml, SRL) in PBS was added to the cells and incubated for 3 h at 37°C. The medium

344

was removed carefully without disturbing the formazan crystals and 100µl of DMSO (Sigma) was added

345

to dissolve the insoluble purple formazan crystals. The absorbance of the suspension was measured at 595

346

nm using Epoch 2 Microplate Reader (BioTek instruments). The percentages of metabolically active cells

347

were compared with the percentage of control cells of the same culture plate as a proxy for cell viability.

348

Cellular cytotoxicity was determined in triplicate and each experiment was repeated three times

349

independently.

350
351

Nano-Luc reporter assay:

352

The Nano-Luc reporter assay was used to determine the luciferase activity as previously mentioned by Tran

353

et al., 2013 (Tran et al. 2013). MDCK cells seeded in a 96 well plate were infected in triplicate with the

354

Nano Luciferase influenza A reporter virus, PASTN. Accordingly, the virus was preincubated with a

355

particular concentration of the nanoparticle/nanocomposite for 30 min or mentioned otherwise. The vehicle

356

control or the nanoparticle/ nanocomposite treated virus was used to infect MDCK cells. The infected cells

357

were harvested at 8hpi and the viral NLuc activity was measured by using Nano-Glo® Luciferase Assay

358

System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) and the luminescence was detected by using

359

a Luminometer (Glomax 20/20, Promega).

360
361

Plaque assay:

362

A non-reporter variant of the influenza A/H1N1/WSN/1933 virus stock solutions MOI 0.1 was either

363

preincubated with vehicle control or Cu-Gr nanocomposite (1uM and 5uM) followed by infection in MDCK

364

cells. At 8hpi, the viral supernatant was collected and used to reinfect MDCK cells and plaque assay was

365

performed to determine the progeny viral titer followed by Matrosovich M, 2006 (Matrosovich et al. 2006).

366

Accordingly, after 1 hr of infection with the virus, cells were overlaid with a media containing a mixture of

367

2X DMEM and 2.4% avicel (1:1 ratio). After 62hrs, the overlay was discarded and the cells were fixed with

368

70% ethanol followed by staining with 2% Crystal violet. Plaques were counted and plaque forming unit

369

(PFU/ml) was calculated to measure the progeny viral titer.

370
371

Viral entry assay:

372

MDCK cells grown on coverslips were infected with vehicle control or 5uM Cu-Gr treated virus at a MOI

373

of 5. Viral entry assay was performed according to the protocol followed by Mondal et al., 2017 (Mondal

374

et al. 2017). Virion binding was performed at 4˚C for 1hr in presence of 1mM of Cycloheximide, CHX

375

(Sigma). The viral inoculum was washed off with cold PBS to remove unbound virus particles. Thereafter,

376

the prewarmed virus growth media (VGM, containing DMEM, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 25 mM

377

HEPES buffer, and 0.5 mg/ml TPCK-trypsin) supplemented with 1mM of CHX was added to the cells and

378

synchronous infection was initiated by shifting cells to 37˚C. At 1 hpi, cells were fixed with 3%

379

formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1M Glycine/0.1% Triton-X 100 in PBS for 20 min at room

380

temperature. Blocking was performed at 4˚C with 3% BSA overnight. NP was detected with anti-NP

381

antibody and Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen). DAPI (Sigma)

382

was used to stain the nucleus. Cells were imaged using Fluorescent microscope (Leica Microsystems) and

383

image analysis was performed with ImageJ software.

384
385

Statistics:

386

Each data is a representative of at least three independent experiments, each experiment was performed in

387

Figure 3. Screening of different the nanoparticles/ nanocomposites for antiviral activity using Nano-

537

Luciferase influenza A reporter. (A) MDCK cells were infected with different amounts (0.01-0.1) of

538

Nano-Luciferase Influenza A reporter virus and the reporter activity was measured using Nano glo reporter

539

assay (Promega). To demonstrate the relationship between the MOI and luciferase activity (arbitrary unit)

540

was plotted as a function of MOI. (B) To test the antiviral activity, the Influenza A reporter virus was

541

pretreated with the 5uM colloidal suspensions of each of the materials for 30 minutes at RT and followed

542

by infection of MDCK cells at MOI of 0.1as diagrammed. (C) Luciferase activity of the nanoparticle/

543

nanocomposite treated sets were measured at 8 hpi and plotted as a relative percentage of the vehicle treated

544

set. For all experiments, data are mean of n=3± standard deviation (*, P< 0.05; n=3 ± sd).

Figure 5. Prior incubation with Cu-Gr nanocomposite severely impacts the infectivity of influenza A

550

virus. (A) A time kinetics experiment was performed by treating Influenza A reporter virus with 5uM

551

colloidal suspensions of Cu-Gr for 15, 30, 45 and 60 min at RT and followed by infection of MDCK cells

552

at MOI 0.1. Absolute luciferase activity values w.r.t viral gene expression for the vehicle and Cu-Gr treated

553

sets are represented by black and grey bars respectively. (B) MDCK cells were infected with Influenza A

554

reporter virus pretreated with vehicle or with different concentrations of the Cu-Gr composite (50nM,

555

100nM, 500nM, 1uM, 2uM and 5uM respectively). Viral gene expression was monitored using luciferase

556

activity assay. Data were normalized to vehicle control sets for each nanoparticle. (C, D) A non-reporter

557

A/H1N1/WSN/1933 influenza virus was either treated with Cu-Gr composite (1uM and 5uM) or with

558

vehicle control prior to infecting MDCK cells. Plaque assay was performed to measure the titer of the

559

progeny virus particles harvested at 8hpi. Percentage reduction in viral titers and actual PFUs for all

560

experiments are represented. For all experiments, data are mean of n=3± standard deviation (*, P< 0.05;

Figure 7. PVA based Cu-Gr nanocomposite coating shows strong antiviral activity. Different wells of

573

a 48 well plate was coated with coating solutions having different concentrations of Cu-Gr composite (1uM,

574

5 uM, 10 uM and 20 uM) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (1mM, 5mM and 10mM). Nano Luciferase-

575

Influenza A virus (MOI 0.1) were inoculated in these wells and incubated for 30 minutes. Post treatment,

576

MDCK cells were infected with the viral inoculum recovered from the coated wells and luciferase activity

577

was determined at 8 hpi using Nano-Glo reporter assay (Promega). Luciferase activity of each set was

578

plotted as a relative percentage of the vehicle treated set. Each data was represented in triplicate and each

579

experiment was repeated three times. Data are presented as means ± standard deviations (SD) (n=3) (*, P<
