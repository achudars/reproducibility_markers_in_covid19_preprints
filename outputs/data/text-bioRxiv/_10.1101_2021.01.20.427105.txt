ABSTRACT
This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of 21 dogs belonging to different United Arab Emirates
(UAE) Ministry of Interior (MOI), trained for COVID‐19 olfactory detection.
The study involved 17 explosives detection dogs, two cadaver detection dogs and two dogs with no
previous detection training. Training lasted two weeks before starting the validation protocol.
Sequential five and seven‐cone line‐ups were used with axillary sweat samples from symptomatic
COVID‐19 individuals (SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR positive) and from asymptomatic COVID‐19 negative individuals

(SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR negative). A total of 1368 trials were performed during validation, including 151
positive and 110 negative samples. Each line‐up had one positive sample and at least one negative
sample. The dog had to mark the positive sample, randomly positioned behind one of the cones. The
dog, handler and data recorder were blinded to the positive sample location.
The calculated overall sensitivities were between 71% and 79% for three dogs, between83% and 87%
for three other dogs, and equal to or higher than 90% for the remaining 15 dogs (more than two thirds
of the 21 dogs).
After calculating the overall sensitivity for each dog using all line‐ups, “matched” sensitivities were
calculated only including line‐ups containing COVID‐19 positive and negative samples strictly
comparable on confounding factors such as diabetes, anosmia, asthma, fever, body pain, diarrhoea,
sex, hospital, method of sweat collection and sampling duration. Most of the time, the sensitivities
increased after matching.
Pandemic conditions in the U.A.E., associated with the desire to use dogs as an efficient mass‐
pretesting tool has already led to the operational deployment of the study dogs.
Future studies will focus on comparatives fields‐test results including the impact of the main COVID‐
19 comorbidities and other respiratory tract infections.

INTRODUCTION
Due to the global COVID‐19 pandemic, there is an increasing need for “easy to use” and rapid testing
methods. COVID‐19 has caused unprecedented challenges requiring a proactive and vigilant approach.
At the end of December 2020 in the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.), the average number of daily tests
was around 146,000, with cumulative numbers of diagnosed COVID‐19 cases and deaths of 197,000
and 645, respectively [1].

Due to potential subsequent waves of COVID‐19 in many countries and the availability of large
numbers of existing drug and explosives detection dogs in the U.A.E., the U.A.E Ministry of Interior
decided to join the Nosaïs multicentre study in April 2020. This program is conducted by the National
Veterinary School of Alfort (France) and the St Joseph University of Beirut (Lebanon) and has been
established to develop the scientific approach of medical detection dogs.
Two recent studies provided evidence that detection dogs appear able to detect COVID‐19 positive
individuals through olfactory detection.[2, 3] In addition to investigating a new COVID‐19 “testing
system”, these studies also show that the “One health ‐ One Medicine” is more important than ever
as it is bringing medical doctors, veterinary surgeons, epidemiologists and dog‐handlers together to
share their knowledge and experience in an attempt to combat the current pandemic.
Numerous studies have suggested that dogs seem able to detect human diseases[4], such as bladder
[5, 6], colon [7, 8], prostate [9‐11], and liver [12] cancers, melanoma [13, 14], diabetes [15‐18],epileptic
fits[19], malaria [20], and bacteriological diseases [21, 22]. The high performances of the dogs in these
studies encouraged further research [23]. It appeared that dogs can detect the Volatile Organic
Compounds (VOCs) generated during the conditions but the specificity of this induced odour to the
microorganism was unclear. Several studies explored the VOCs induced by infectious processes but
these focussed on the disease‐related inflammatory reaction or oxidative stress, without looking at
the specificities of the involved pathogen [24‐28]. In 2014, Aksenov et al. [29] demonstrated that the
VOCs produced by cell‐cultures infected by three different types of Influenza viruses (H9N2, H6N2 and
H1N1) were specific to each virus. More recently, Abd el Qader et al. [30] and Schivo et al. [31] reached
the same conclusion with different rhinoviruses. Therefore, there is a high probability that
coronaviruses follow the same rule and that SARS‐CoV‐2 generates specific VOCs [32] but this is yet to
be proven.
Training dogs for acute medical detection is not easy, as the whole process requires a large number of
high‐quality samples (both positive and negative samples in the case of COVID‐19). But once correctly

trained, dogs can be used in real‐time to detect whether or not individuals are infected by an active
SARS‐CoV‐2 virus.
To provide evidence that dogs can detect COVID‐19 positive individuals, the study protocol must follow
recommendations to prevent biases and over‐interpretation of the results.[33‐35] These
recommendations include ensuring the dog handler is unaware of the individual’s disease status when
presenting to the dog, ensuring the dog is presented one sample no more than once during the training
and the validation sessions, ensuring control samples are comparable to positive samples except for
disease status (to avoid confounding bias), and randomising sample positions in the line‐up when used.
This study aimed to estimate the individual sensitivity of dogs trained to detect COVID‐19 positive
individuals.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was conducted using the guidelines written by the Nosaïs program team of Alfort National
Veterinary School (France) [3], and was conducted in strict accordance with the ethical principles in
the Declaration of Helsinki (60th General Assembly of the AMM, Seoul‐Korea, October 2013).

Samples
COVID‐19 positive and negative axillary sweat samples used for the training and the validation sessions
were collected by doctors and nurses in assigned U.A.E government hospitals (listed in Table 1) who
were trained not to contaminate the samples with their own odours. The reasons for choosing sweat,
the sampling site and method, and biological safety measures have been described previously by
Grandjean et al. [3].
Patients presenting to one of the participating hospitals with COVID‐19 clinical symptoms (such as
fever, cough, throat pain, malaise or body pain), and having a positive Reverse Transcription

Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT‐PCR) or PCR test for SARS‐CoV‐2 were included as positive individuals.
Patients from the participating hospitals with a negative COVID‐19 PCR test result were included as
negative individuals. All individuals meeting these inclusion criteria were asked if they were willing to
participate in the study and signed an individual informed consent form approved by the national
ethics committee.
Sweat samples were collected using Getxent inert polymers tubes positioned in direct contact with
the skin (occasionally over the first layer of clothes) in the patient’s axilla for up to 20 minutes. The
tubes were stored in tinted glass jars (to prevent UV ray damage) placed in individual biohazard bags.
The bags were marked with the patients’ individual anonymous code and the RT‐PCR results. Positive
and negative samples were separated and stored in a refrigerator. No samples were screened for other
human coronaviruses like beta coronaviruses HCoV‐OC43 or alpha coronavirus HCoV‐229E.
Individual data collection
Medical staff recorded demographic and medical data about the included individuals, strictly
respecting local regulations. These data included: age, sex, weight, and the presence or absence of
hypertension, diabetes, fever, dry cough, body pain, sore throat, diarrhoea, asthma, and anosmia.
Sample transportations
Once collected, samples were transported from the hospital to the Dubaï Police K9 Training Centre
once a day by a dedicated Ministry of the Interior driver. All individually packaged samples were
transported in two‐compartment medical coolers with icepacks ensuring the positive and negative
samples remained separate.
Sample storage
Samples were stored in boxes (keeping positive and negatives samples separate) in a refrigerator at
4°C until they were used for the dog training or validation sessions. They were never manipulated
without disposable surgical gloves to prevent any odour contamination.

Canine resources
A total of 21 dogs participated in the study belonging to the following U.A.E institutions: Dubai Police,
Fujairah Police, Ajman Police, Ras Al Khaimah Police, Sharjah Police, U.A.E Land forces, and U.A.E
Federal Customs. They were explosives detection dogs (n=17), cadaver detection dogs (n=2), and
“green” dogs (i.e. dogs without previous olfactory detection training) (Table 2). Explosives detection
dogs were chosen because they are already trained to detect 20 to 30 different explosives odours so
the potential COVID‐19 specific odour would be easily memorised and generalised. Cadaver detection
dogs are accustomed to olfactory detection and their training does not interfere with a new odour
being imprinted. “Green” dogs begin training with a short period of nose work.
Biological safety features
Despite a few publications suggesting that infected dogs may transmit the virus back to humans [36],
the World Organisation for Animal Health attests that, for dogs, infection susceptibility is low and there
is no transmission risk[37]. Based on these facts and in addition to the biological safety measures
described for the sweat samples, measures were implemented including dog handlers and assistants
wearing masks and disposable gloves, no petting with bare‐hands, and no kissing the dog or allowing
the dog to lick. The training and validation sessions used five and seven‐cone line‐ups (see below)
which prevented the dog contacting the samples (Figure 1). Furthermore, for safety reasons, samples
were not used for training or validation sessions within 24 hours of collection.
Training protocol
As previously described,[3] dogs were trained to work on an olfactory cone line‐up (Figure 2) and mark
the cones containing the COVID‐19 positive sample by sitting in front of it. The training sessions started
on June 6th, 2020 and took place at the Dubai Police K9 Training Centre. All dogs were trained for eight
hours daily over a two week period. The training process followed a 4‐step procedure:: (step 1) learning
line‐up work, (step 2) memorising the COVID‐19 sample odour (positive samples and empty cones in

the line‐up), (step 3) introducing mocks (positive samples and empty inert polymers tubes in the line‐
up), and (step 4) introducing negative samples without mocks in the line‐up (around 30% of samples
in the line‐ups were COVID‐19 positive). Steps 1 and 2 were carried out in week one and steps 3 (1 day)
and 4 (5 days) were carried out in week two. At the end of week two, the handlers judged whether
their dog was trained and ready for the validation process. Table 3 shows the number of samples
(either COVID‐19 positive or negative) sniffed by the dogs during step 4 of training and the number
correctly marked (i.e. the dog only marked COVID‐19 positive samples).
Validation protocol
The validation sessions took place in Dubaï Police K9 Training Centre. No samples used for training
were used for validation. Most of the time, 5‐cone olfactory line‐ups were used. Seven‐cone line‐ups
were used at the end of validation when dog handlers considered their dog ready for deployment in
the field. There was always only one COVID‐19 positive sample in the line‐up, with the remaining cones
containing COVID‐19 negative sample(s) (at least one in the line‐up) or being empty (i.e. without
sampling material). The COVID‐19 positive and negative sample locations in the line‐up were randomly
assigned and samples were placed by one dedicated person who remained in the room. The data
recorder collected data in the room using dedicated software developed by Dubaï Police (Figure 2) and
was blinded to the COVID‐19 positive and negative sample locations. Once the samples were placed
behind the cones, the handler and the dog entered the room, and the dog was asked to sniff each
cone, one by one. There was no visual contact between the dedicated sample placement person and
either the dog or the dog handler. If the dog marked a cone, the handler asked the dog to resume the
task for the remaining cones in the line‐up (i.e. sequential line‐up). The dog handler considered a cone
marked when the dog sat, stopped or barked. Each time the dog marked (whether correctly or
incorrectly), the dog handler gave a reward and the data recorder recorded it. Once all the cones in
the line‐up had been sniffed, the dog handler and data recorder were informed of the COVID‐19
positive sample location. The handler then knew if the dog had failed to mark the COVID‐19 positive

sample too many times for corrective measures (which did not happen). Only the COVID‐19 positive
sample results (i.e. presence or absence of marking) were recorded for statistical analyses.
Statistical analysis
Since only the COVID‐19 positive sample results were available, sensitivities but not specificities were
calculated. All line‐ups including a COVID‐19 positive sample which had been sniffed in a previous line‐
up were removed from the sensitivity calculations for this dog. Overall sensitivities and “matched”
sensitivities were calculated for each dog.
The overall sensitivity was calculated by dividing the number of correctly marked COVID‐19 positive
samples by the total number of COVID‐19 positive samples it had sniffed (one per line‐up). The 95%
confidence interval (CI) was calculated using Jeffreys’ method [38].
The comparability criterion (i.e. positive samples are comparable to negative samples in the line‐up in
all ways, except for the disease status) is a key criterion in detection dog studies to prevent
confounding bias occurring[34, 39]. To provide evidence that confounding bias did not elevate the
overall sensitivity, “matched” sensitivities were calculated for line‐ups in which the COVID‐19 positive
and negative sample(s) were matched for health conditions, age, sex, hospital, sampling duration, or
the sweat collection method (underarm or over clothes). The potentially confounding health
conditions used for matching included: diabetes, anosmia, asthma, fever, body pain, and diarrhoea.
Hypertension, dry cough, and sore throat were not matching variables since they were not thought to
be potential attractors for dogs. The line‐up was considered “matched” for one health condition if the
health condition of the COVID‐19 positive patient in the line‐up was the same (either present or
absent) as all the COVID‐19 negative patients in that line‐up. If health condition data were missing for
any line‐up samples, the line‐up was not considered “matched” for this condition. The same matching
method was used for sweat collection method. If sampling duration was equal to 20 minutes for all
the line‐up samples, the line‐up was considered “matched”. To be “matched” for age, the difference
between the age of the COVID‐19 positive and negative patients in the line‐up was <15 years. Matching
was performed one characteristic at a time.

Binary and qualitative variables were presented as numbers and proportions, and quantitative
variables (age and weight) were presented as medians and interquartile ranges. The Spearman rank
correlation coefficient was calculated to quantify the association between the dogs’ performance in
step 4 of training and the overall sensitivities calculated during validation. Statistical analyses were
performed using SAS® University Edition (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

RESULTS
A total of 151 COVID‐19 positive patients and 110 COVID‐19 negative patients were recruited,
producing 261 sweat samples used only in the validation line‐ups. The 151 COVID‐19 positive patients
were recruited mainly from Sharjah Field and Al Qasimi hospitals, and the 110 COVID‐19 negative
patients were recruited mainly from Al Qasimi, Rashid, and Saqr hospitals (Table 4). The proportion of
females was higher among COVID‐19 negative patients (36%) compared with COVID‐19 positive
patients (6%). The median age and weight were similar between COVID‐19 negative and positive
patients (40 vs 36 years and 75 vs 70 kg, respectively). Similarly, the proportions of patients presenting
fever and body pain were similar between COVID‐19 negative and positive patients (10% vs 10% and
20% vs 17%, respectively). Hypertension and diabetes were more frequent in COVID‐19 negative
patients (36% and 30%, respectively) than in COVID‐19 positive patients (15% and 14%, respectively).
Sore throat, diarrhoea, asthma, and anosmia were present in <2% of the 261 study participants. Sweat
was collected over clothes (as opposed to direct skin contact) in 14% of COVID‐19 negative patients
and 3% of COVID‐19 positive patients (Table 5). For 84% of COVID‐19 negative patients and 85% of
COVID‐19 positive patients, the sampling material remained in contact with the skin for 20 minutes.
The median number of dogs sniffing one COVID‐19 negative sample was five dogs (interquartile range,
four to seven dogs; range, one to 19 dogs); it was also five dogs (interquartile range, four to five dogs;
range, one to 18 dogs) for COVID‐19 positive samples.
A total of 1786 trials were performed during training, and 1368 during validation. The minimum
number of line‐ups performed by the dogs was 15 (Bolton), and the maximum number was 60 (Cuba;

Table 6), with a median number of 35 line‐ups (interquartile range, 27 to 48 line‐ups) . The median
number of samples (either COVID‐19 positive or negative) per line‐up was two for 13 dogs, three for
seven dogs, and four for one dog. Seven‐cone line‐ups (as opposed to 5‐cone) were used for nine dogs
at the end of the validation. When considering all line‐ups performed by each dog, the overall
sensitivity ranged from 71% (Fudu) to 100% (Nox, Allo, Ramos, Cody, and Bolt) (Table 6). The sensitivity
was >80% in 18 of the 21 study dogs, and > 90% in 15 of the 21 dogs. The 95% confidence interval
lower bound was >80% in 12 of the 21 dogs. The dogs’ performances during step 4 of training were
correlated to overall sensitivities during validation (Spearman rank correlation r = 0.62; p < 0.01;
Figure 3).
Table 7 presents all “matched” sensitivities calculated for each dog using the matched line‐ups. For
instance, Fudu had six line‐ups which were “matched” for diabetes. Fudu marked five of these six
COVID‐19 positive samples, leading to a diabetes “matched” sensitivity of 83%. Table 7 also highlights
that in most cases, “matched” sensitivities are equal to or higher than the overall sensitivity calculated
before matching. The matching characteristics resulting in decreased sensitivity were anosmia and
asthma, with sensitivity only decreasing in eight of the 21 dogs.

DISCUSSION
During this validation process, a total of 261 samples (110 COVID‐19 negative and 151 COVID‐19
positive samples) were sniffed by the 21 study dogs. The estimated overall sensitivities were between
71% and 79% for three dogs, between 83% and 87% for three other dogs, and >90% for the remaining
15 dogs (representing 71% of the 21 dogs). These results may appear heterogeneous but considering
other COVID‐19 detection methods require a sensitivity >90% before implementation, more than two
thirds of the 21 trained dogs could be selected to start work.
Four of the 21 dogs did not reach a sensitivity of 85% (Axel, Bren, Fudu, and Spike). Interestingly, these
dogs also had the lowest performances during step 4 of training. The significant correlation between

the training and validation performances (Figure 4) could arise from chance, confounding bias (i.e. no
causal association), or a true causal association. If confounding bias is causing the significant
correlation, it means there is at least one intrinsic or extrinsic characteristic of the dyad (the dog and
its handler) causing the two phenomena (high performances during training and validation).
Characteristics could include a genetic factor enabling the dog to easily detect SARS‐CoV‐2 [41] or a
good human‐dog relationship within the dyad [42]. This hypothesis is supported by the heterogeneous
performances during training and validation despite identical working hours for all dogs and by the
good performances of the two “green” dogs (Ace and Bolt) during training (89% and 94%, respectively)
and validation (86% and 100%). If a true causal association is causing the significant correlation, then
increasing the dog’s performance during training is likely to increase the performance during
validation. If increasing the number of training days increases training performances, then one reason
for the heterogenous overall sensitivities in our study might be that the dogs with the lowest
sensitivities required more than two weeks training. Our data did not enable the statistical association
between performances during training and validation to be estimated after taking potential
confounders into account.
The two week training period was much shorter than reported in some detection dog studies, but was
in accordance with two previous studies on COVID‐19 detection dogs [2, 3]. The training (Table 3) and
validation (Table 6) performances support the hypothesis that two weeks of intensive training seems
sufficient for most explosives and cadaver detection dogs. Interestingly, one of the two “green” dogs
reached an overall sensitivity of 100% and the other reached 86% suggesting that even dogs with no
training in olfactory detection may be trained to detect COVID‐19 positive individuals. Further studies
identifying factors associated with elevated training and validation performances are necessary to
maximize training efficacy.
The main limitation of our study was the absence of data on dogs marking COVID‐19 negative samples.
This prevented us from calculating lower and higher bounds of estimated sensitivities, specificities,
and positive and negative predictive values, as recommended for detection dogs studies.[43]

Therefore, we cannot rule out that the dogs had a high sensitivity with poor specificity. Although low
specificity values are possible, it is not expected based on the training performances. Since around 70%
of the samples used in the training line‐ups (step 4) were COVID‐19 negative, it would not be possible
to obtain a low specificity if the sensitivity and global performance during training were high. For
example, for the five dogs reaching an overall sensitivity of 100% (Allo, Bolt, Cody, Nox and Ramos)
during validation, the lowest performance in step 4 of training was 86% (Nox). If Nox’s sensitivity had
been 100% in training, Nox’s specificity would have to be 79% to reach a global performance of 86%.
Further studies collecting data for COVID‐19 positive and negative samples are necessary to estimate
sensitivities and specificities, and to calculate positive and negative predictive values.
Since the beginning of the COVID‐19 pandemic, RT‐PCR has been the reference testing method, and is
considered reliable for SARS‐CoV‐2. However, Axell‐House et al. recently evaluated the diagnostic
accuracy of the COVID‐19 test in a scoping review [44]. They found substantial heterogeneity among
available studies in terms of test types, reference standards, metrics, and details of study design and
methodology, and concluded that “while more than 200 SARS‐CoV‐2 molecular diagnostic tests have
received FDA [Emergency Use Authorizations], we have described […] that the performance of few of
these tests has been assessed appropriately. […] The accuracy of these tests should be interpreted
with caution”. In this context, the sensitivities of the 21 study dogs may have been underestimated or
overestimated since their calculation was based on the fact that the RT‐PCR is a “gold standard” with
a positive predictive value of 100% (i.e. the 151 COVID‐19 positive patients were all truly infected by
SARS‐CoV‐2) [45].
Twelve dogs always had 5‐cone line‐ups. For the remaining dogs, a maximum of 10% of line‐ups had
seven cones (Table 6). Cone number had little effect on overall sensitivities. Looking just at the 5‐cone
line‐ups containing four or five samples, the overall sensitivities were lower for five dogs, remained
the same for 5 other dogs, and was increased for the 11 remaining dogs (data not shown). Line‐ups
with few samples had the benefit of being easier to “match” since matching line‐ups with one positive
and one negative sample was easier than one positive and three or four negative samples.

In detection dog studies using line‐ups, to be confident that dogs detect the studied disease itself and
not a characteristic specific to the disease (a confounding factor), disease and disease‐free samples in
the line‐up must be comparable, except for the disease status [34, 39]. As with observational studies
(such as case‐control studies), matching disease and disease‐free samples in a line‐up for more than
one or two potential confounding factors would have been complicated. This is because the sweat
sample had to be sniffed within days after sampling making it impossible to wait for an appropriate
matched sample. Furthermore, the daily number of SARS‐CoV‐2 infected patients presenting in one
hospital who undergo a RT‐PCR test was not high enough to find matching COVID‐19 negative patients
from the same hospital. The hospital was the only characteristic which could have been matched for
COVID‐19 negative and positive samples but was not possible in the present study for organisational
reasons. Apart from this characteristic, matching potential confounding factors in detection dogs
studies working with line‐ups should be performed a posteriori, when performing statistical analyses.
“Matched” sensitivities were calculated after the overall sensitivity for each dog. Theoretically, if a
characteristic was a confounding factor causing high overall sensitivities, matching for this
characteristic would have systematically decreased sensitivity in all 21 dogs. This decreased sensitivity
was only observed for eight of the 21 dogs when matching for anosmia and asthma (Table 7). Most of
the time, sensitivities increased after matching. Hypertension, dry cough, and sore throat were not
considered potential confounding factors. However, sensitivity decreased for eight dogs when
matching for hypertension and sore throat and for seven dogs when matching for dry cough (data not
shown). Overall, these results do not prove that the overall sensitivities were due to a specific
characteristic, and not SARS‐CoV‐2.
Some characteristics, other than the ones collected, could possibly cause a residual confounding bias
such as medication use.

However, matching for health conditions was likely to remove any

confounding bias, at least for medications related to this condition, but it cannot be ruled out that
other medications could be a confounder. Future studies should collect data regarding medication use
for matching.

Our study has some strengths in accordance with previous recommendations for detection dog studies
[33‐35]. These include different samples being used in the training and validation sessions, randomised
sample position, a large number of study dogs (of the 54 detection dog studies reviewed by Johnen et
al. in 2017, only three involved more than 21 dogs[35]), only one sweat sample per individual and a
large number of recruited individuals (n=261). Our study can be considered double‐blind since the dog,
its handler, and the data recorder were blinded to the sample locations. However, since the dedicated
sample placement person remained in the room during the sessions, albeit with no visual contact with
the dog or handler, the study cannot be considered fully blinded and therefore does not completely
meet this recommended criterion. Despite the lack of visual contact, some unintentional influence on
sample choice cannot be totally ruled out.

CONCLUSION
A total of 1786 trials were performed during the training period, and 1368 during the validation period
(using 151 positive and 110 negative samples). Calculated sensitivities range from 71% to 100%, but
only three of the 21 dogs were under 80%, allowing the U.A.E. authorities to deploy the dogs in three
international airports.
These results show that major conditions such as diabetes do not interfere with olfactory detection of
COVID‐19 in sweat, but confirmation is required with more specific studies. Future studies will focus
on comparative field‐test results including the impact of the main COVID‐19 comorbidities and other
respiratory tract infections and comparison with the different rapid COVID‐19 tests in use.

Numbers are expressed as n/N (“matched” Se), where n is the number of correct identifications, N is the total number of line‐ups containing one COVID‐19 positive sample and at least one COVID‐19 negative
sample matched for the matching variable, and Se the sensitivity expressed as a percentage. Grey cells indicate when the “matched” sensitivity calculated in matched line‐ups was equal to or higher than the
overall sensitivity calculated in all line‐ups (see Table 4).
