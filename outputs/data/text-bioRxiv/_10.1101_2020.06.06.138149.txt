Abstract

31

The spread of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections worldwide has raised

32

concerns about the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2. Devices that rapidly inactivate viruses

33

can reduce the chance of infection through aerosols and contact transmission. This in vitro study

34

demonstrated that irradiation with a deep ultraviolet light-emitting diode (DUV-LED) of 280 ±5 nm

35

wavelength rapidly inactivates SARS-CoV-2 obtained from a COVID-19 patient. Development of

36

devices equipped with DUV-LED is expected to prevent virus invasion through the air and after

37

touching contaminated objects.

Letter

40

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spread worldwide and placed countries in

41

emerging, rapidly transforming situations. The World Health Organization (WHO) clarified that

42

more than 5.3 million cases of COVID-19 and 342,000 deaths had been reported to WHO by 25

43

May 2020 [1]. Infectious virus is detected in specimens from the respiratory tract, nasopharyngeal

44

sites, and feces in COVD-19 patients [2]. Recently, infectious SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the

45

urine of a COVID-19 patient [3]. SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in aerosols for up to 3 h, up to 4 h on

46

copper, up to 24 h on cardboard and up to 2–3 days on plastic and stainless steel [4]. To prevent

47

exposure to contaminated material (contact infection), which is one of the major transmission routes,

48

hand hygiene with alcohol is recommended, but its effectiveness in preventing the spread of

49

SARS-CoV-2 infection may be insufficient [5, 6].

50

A deep ultraviolet light-emitting diode (DUV-LED) instrument generating around 250–300 nm

51

wavelength has been reported to effectively inactivate microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses

52

and fungi [7–10], but effects on SARS-CoV-2 have not been reported. We evaluated the antiviral

53

efficacy of irradiation by DUV-LED, generating the narrow-range wavelength (280±5 nm) (Nikkiso

54

Co., Tokyo, Japan), against SARS-CoV-2.

55

A strain of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a patient who developed COVID-19 in the cruise ship

56

Diamond Princess in Japan in February 2020 [11] was obtained from the Kanagawa Prefectural

57

Institute of Public Health (SARS-CoV-2/Hu/DP/Kng/19-027, LC528233). The virus was propagated

58

in Vero cells cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 2% fetal bovine serum

59

(FBS). At 48 h after infection, virus stocks were collected by centrifuging the culture supernatants of

60

infected Vero cells at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. Clarified supernatants were kept at -80 °C until use.

61

Aliquots of stock virus were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline and adjusted to 2.0 ×104

62

plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml. For the evaluation of DUV-LED inactivation, aliquots of virus stock

63

(150 μl) were placed in the center of a 60-mm Petri dish and irradiated with 3.75 mW/cm2 at work

64

distance 20 mm for a range of times (n=3 each for 1, 10, 20, 30, or 60 s). Each virus stock irradiated

65

with DUV-LED was serially diluted in 10-fold steps, then inoculated onto Vero monolayers in a

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.06.138149; this version posted June 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

66

12-well plate. After adsorption of virus for 2 h, cells were overlaid with MEM containing 1%

67

carboxymethyl cellulose and 2% FBS (final concentration). Cells were incubated for 72 h in a CO2

68

incubator, then cytopathic effects were observed under a microscope. An unirradiated virus

69

suspension was used as a negative control. To calculate PFU, cells were fixed with 10% formalin for

70

30 min, followed by staining with 0.1% methylene blue solution. The antiviral effects of DUV-LED

71

irradiations were assessed using the logPFU ratio, calculated as logPFU ratio=log10 (Nt/N0), where

72

Nt is the PFU count of the UV-irradiated sample, and N0 is the PFU count of the sample without UV

73

irradiation. In addition, the infectious titer reduction rate was calculated as (1-1/10log PFU ratio) × 100

74

(%). All experiments were performed in a BSL-3 laboratory.

75

We observed a marked cytopathic effect in virus-infected cells without DUV-LED irradiation

76

(Figure 1A, see “0 s”). In contrast, virus-infected cells irradiated for 60 s showed largely comparable

77

morphology to mock cells (Figure 1A, see “60 s”). To our surprise, virus-infected cells irradiated for

78

1 s showed minimal change (Figure 1A, see “1 s”). The plaque assay (Figure 1B) revealed that short

79

time DUV-LED irradiation rapidly inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1C and Table S1). Of note, the

80

infectious titer reduction rate of 87.4% was already recognized with irradiation of virus stock for 1 s,

81

and the rate was 99.9% with irradiation for 10 s. These results suggest that DUV-LED drastically

82

inactivated SARS-CoV-2 with irradiation for even a very short time.

83

UV-LEDs providing irradiation at various peak emission wavelengths, such as UV-A (320–400

84

nm), UV-B (280–320 nm), and UV-C (100–280 nm), have been adopted to inactivate various

85

pathogenic species, including bacteria, viruses and fungi. Devices equipped with UV-LEDs are now

86

beginning to be introduced into medical fields. UV-C is considered to be the most effective

87

germicidal region of the UV spectrum, acting through the formation of photoproducts in DNA [12].

88

These pyrimidine dimers interrupt transcription, translation and replication of DNA, eventually

89

leading to inactivation of microorganisms [13]. The efficacy of this inactivation may depend not

90

only on the wavelength, but also on factors such as the target (e.g., bacterial species), light output

91

and environmental conditions. The DUV-LED we used has the characteristics of a narrow-range

92

wavelength and high power for short exposure times and long-term use. This study demonstrated for

93

the first time the rapid inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 under DUV-LED irradiation. As shown in

94

Figure 1B, cytopathic effects were observed in control Vero cells infected with SARS-Cov-2, but not

95

in these cells with DUV-LED irradiation for only 10 s. As well as in community settings, healthcare

96

settings are also vulnerable to the invasion and spread of SARS-CoV-2, and the stability of

97

SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols and on surfaces [4] likely contributes to virus transmission in medical

98

environments. No vaccines, neutralizing antibodies, or drugs are currently available for prevention

99

and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. By revealing that SARS-Cov-2 inactivation can be achieved with

100

very short-term DUV-LED irradiation, this study provides useful baseline data toward securing a

101

safer medical environment. Development of devices equipped with DUV-LED is expected to prevent
