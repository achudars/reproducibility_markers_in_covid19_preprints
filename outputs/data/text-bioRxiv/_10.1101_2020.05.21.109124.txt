Abstract:
The presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and high levels of viral RNA in the stool suggest active Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication within enterocytes. Here, in
multiple, large cohorts of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we have studied the
intersections between Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), intestinal inflammation and IBD
treatment. A striking expression of ACE2 on the small bowel enterocyte brush border supports intestinal
infectivity by SARS-CoV-2. Commonly used IBD medications, both biologic and non-biologic, do not
significantly impact ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptor expression in the uninflamed intestines. Additionally,
we have defined molecular responses to COVID-19 infection that are also enriched in IBD, pointing to
shared molecular networks between COVID-19 and IBD. These data generate a novel appreciation of the
confluence of COVID-19- and IBD-associated inflammation and provide mechanistic insights supporting
further investigation of specific IBD drugs in the treatment of COVID-19.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the ensuing coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19)1, have evolved into a global pandemic of unprecedented proportions2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a carboxypeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of
angiotensin I into angiotensin 1-9, and angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-73-6. ACE2 can also be cleaved by
serine proteases such as transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS) 2, TMPRSS11D and TMPRSS1.
Early events in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection include attachment of the receptor binding
domain of the viral spike (S) protein to epithelial ACE27-10. The S protein is then cleaved by TMPRSS2,
which facilitates viral entry into the cytoplasm of the host cell11. Following infection with SARS-CoV,
ACE2 is downregulated in the lungs, resulting in unopposed renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
(RAAS) and contributing to disease severity12, 13.
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) encompassing Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
(UC) are chronic, inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that are treated with
conventional

immunosuppressive

immunomodulatory drugs14,

15

drugs

such

as

corticosteroids,

biologic

therapies

and

. Given that SARS-CoV-2 co-opts receptors expressed by intestinal

epithelial cells, COVID-19 has the potential to intersect with the pathogenesis of IBD and by extension,
its treatment, at a number of points16, 17. For example, ACE2 expression may be potentially be altered
during gut inflammation or by IBD medications. Further, immunomodulatory drugs used in IBD
therapeutics14,

15

could potentially be used in COVID-19 patients to manage the “cytokine storm”

associated with severe disease.
Therefore, in this study we systematically examined potential areas of intersection between the
uninflamed and inflamed GI tract and COVID-19 disease. The results of this study may improve our
molecular understanding of how COVID-19 intersects IBD and may provide a rationale for further
investigation of drugs used in IBD therapeutics for use in patients with COVID-19.

Methods
Immunofluorescence microscopy:
Specimens were obtained via clinical endoscopy during routine care (Table S1, S2). Tissue was formalin
fixed and paraffin embedded by the clinical pathology core at our institution. Primary antibodies used
included ACE2 (abcam-ab15348, 1:1000), EPCAM (abcam-ab228023, prediluted) and mouse antiTMPRSS2 (Millipore-MABF2158, 1:500) and staining was performed as detailed in supplementary
methods.

Study cohorts:

1. Cross sectional cohorts:
i. The Mount Sinai Crohn’s and Colitis Registry (MSCCR):
Peripheral blood and biopsy whole transcriptome sequencing data was obtained from a cross sectional
cohort (~1200 patients) who were enrolled in the Mount Sinai Crohn’s and Colitis Registry (MSCCR)
between December 2013 and September 2016 via a protocol approved by the Icahn School of Medicine at
Mount Sinai Institutional Review Board. Analysis of the MSCCR cohort is detailed in supplementary
methods.
ii. The RISK cohort18: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in treatment-free pediatric CD (<17 years of age) patients
was studied using RNA-seq expression profiles from GSE57945, which includes ileal biopsies from
endoscopically defined inflamed samples (n=160), non-inflamed (n=53) and non-IBD controls (n=42).
2. Longitudinal Cohorts:
i) The GSE100833 series which includes expression profiles from the gut of 80 anti-TNFα refractory CD
patients and the blood from 226 patients enrolled in a phase 2b crossover trial (CERTIFI trial) with
ustekinumab as described previously19 (detailed in supplementary methods).

ii)The GSE73661 series which includes gene expression profiles (Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays)
from colonic biopsies from moderate-to-severe UC patients enrolled in two Vedolizumab efficacy trials
(GEMINI-I and GEMINI LTS)20 as detailed in supplementary methods. The GSE73661 series also
included 12 non-IBD colonic biopsies and colonic biopsies from 23 UC patients before and 4-6 weeks
after first infliximab treatment. Response was defined as endoscopic mucosal healing.

MSCCR Bayesian gene regulatory network (BGRN) generation:
BGRNs can capture fundamental properties of complex systems in states that give rise to complex
(diseased) phenotypes19. BGRNs were generated from RNA sequence data generated on intestinal
biopsies from the MSCCR cohort using their intestinal expression QTL information (eQTLs) as priors.
The BGRNs were region- (ileum or colon/rectum) and disease- (CD, UC, and control) specific and
included both inflamed and uninflamed biopsies and were constructed using RIMBAnet software19 and
visualized using Cytoscape 3.721. We also used two publicly available BGRNs from the RISK and the
CERTIFI cohort19 (supplementary methods).

Bayesian gene regulatory subnetwork generation:

ACE2 and TMPRSS2 subnetworks: Gene-centric subnetworks were generated by selecting either ACE2 or
TMPRSS2 from various BGRNs and expanding out three to five layers (undirected) to obtain the nearest
ACE2 or TMPRSS2 neighbors. The connected subnetworks obtained were generally between 200-500
genes in total.
IBD Inflammation, COVID-19 and IBD Drug Response- Subnetwork generation:

We curated RNA-seq based molecular signatures related to IBD and COVID-19 response by
identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as detailed in supplementary methods. Genes found
differentially expressed in blood48, lung NHBE/A54931 or human small intestinal organoids34 (hSIO)
following SARS-CoV-2 infection; IBD inflammation; or response to medications were separately
projected onto various BGRNs allowing for 1 or 2 nearest neighbors depending on the signature sizes.
The most connected subnetworks were then extracted to generate model-specific SARS-CoV-2 infection-;
IBD inflammation-; or drug-response- associated subnetworks (supplementary methods).

Pathway and geneset enrichment analysis of subnetworks:
Gene subnetworks were tested for functional enrichment using a Fisher’s exact test with BenjaminiHochberg (BH) multiple test correction on a collection of genesets. The collection of genesets included i)
Reactome pathways sourced from Enrichr22, i) gene sets from Smillie et al23, ii) Huang et al24, iii) various
macrophage perturbations (e.g. cytokines)25, iv) ACE2 co-expressed genes26 and v) reported IBD GWAS
genes (see supplementary methods). Pathway and geneset enrichment, as well as intersection between
networks were tested using a Fisher’s exact test and p-values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis with
BH correction.

Key driver gene analysis:
Key driver analysis (KDA) identifies key or “master” driver genes for a given gene set in a given BGRN.
We used a previously described KDA algorithm37 which is summarized in supplementary methods.
Genesets for KDA included those associated with NHBE-COVID-19 infection or IBD inflammation. Key
driver genes (KDGs) were summarized by frequency across the networks.

Geneset variation analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infection gene expression signatures:
Expression of COVID-19 response gene signatures derived from whole blood or epithelial models was
evaluated in the context of IBD related inflammation were studied using gene set variation analysis
(GSVA). For each COVID-19 response signature, a sample-wise enrichment score was quantified from
each transcriptomic profile in the MSCCR and CERTIFI cohorts using GSVA. COVID-19 response
GSVA scores were then modeled to test the association with patient-derived phenotypic information.

Results

Healthy gut segments express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins
To define the localization and distribution of ACE2, immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy was performed
on histologically normal GI tissue in 20 adults (9 males, 11 females) and 11 children (7 males, 4 females)
(Figure 1 and Table S1). ACE2 expression was observed on the small intestinal surface epithelium in all
subjects in a continuous distribution with the exception of occasional breaks representing the mucin from
goblet cells (Figure 1a-b). In all examined small intestinal segments, ACE2 could be detected on the crypt
epithelium, though to a lesser extent than on the surface epithelium. TMPRSS2 expression was less
abundant in the small bowel, and when detectable, was exclusively found on crypt epithelium (Figure
S1a-b). There was no observable age or sex dependence of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 protein expression in the
small bowel.
In the colon, ACE2 expression was patchy and could not be identified in every subject, in contrast
to the small bowel (Figure 1c). This inconsistency across different donors could not be readily associated
with age, sex, ACE inhibitor treatment, nor the colonic segment being examined. In contrast, TMPRSS2
expression was more robust in the colon and was readily detectable on both surface and crypt epithelia
(Figure S1c). Thus, ACE2 in the healthy gut is higher in the small bowel than the large bowel and
inversely, expresses more TMPRSS2 protein in the colon compared to the small bowel.

ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression varies in healthy or inflamed gut segments by region
Next, we examined ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels in the intestine of non-IBD controls and IBD
patients with active and inactive disease enrolled in MSCCR (Table S3). As the number of samples for
the colon non-rectum locations was low (Figure S3a/b) and no discernable differences were observed,
colon non-rectum biopsies were grouped together to increase statistical power. Consistent with the
protein data, ACE2 gene expression was higher in the uninflamed ileum compared to the uninflamed
colon or rectum. With inflammation, ileal ACE2 mRNA expression was significantly decreased compared
to either uninflamed biopsies from IBD patients or non-IBD controls. In contrast, in the rectum ACE2
mRNA expression was increased with inflammation when compared to the uninflamed IBD patients or
non-IBD controls (Figure 2a, upper panels). There were no significant differences by disease location or
between patients with UC versus CD (Figure S4). We further validated these results using the pediatric
IBD RISK cohort18 where ACE2 mRNA was significantly decreased in the ileum of patients with active
IBD as well (Figure 2b).

The expression of TMPRSS2 in the MSCCR cohort was moderately higher in the colon compared
to ileum. In both ileum and colon biopsies TMPRSS2 expression was found significantly increased in the
inflamed relative to non-inflamed samples, although the effect sizes were small (Figure 2a, lower
panels).
With IF microscopy (Table S2), we could not appreciate differences in ACE2 expression in the
ileum, which possibly stemmed from the elevated physiological expression of ACE2. In the colon, patchy
epithelial ACE2 expression from control non-IBD controls increased in IBD patients with inflammation
and this increase was mostly evident on the crypt epithelium (Figure S2a).
In the ileum, low intensity TMPRSS2 expression on the crypt epithelium was also comparable in
inflamed or uninflamed mucosal segments from IBD patients and in non-inflamed mucosal segments
from non-IBD controls. In the colon, TMPRSS2 expression appeared comparable in IBD patients and
non-IBD controls. In the rectum, TMPRSS2 expression was enhanced by inflammation (Figure S2a).

Age and gender but not smoking increases ACE2 mRNA in the colon
ACE2 mRNA was higher with age in the uninflamed rectum samples. However, these effects were
essentially nullified in the presence of inflammation. A positive association with age in inflamed CD
ileum and a negative association in inflamed UC rectum biopsies was observed. ACE2 mRNA in the
uninflamed rectum was significantly lower in males versus females but no gender associations in
TMPRSS2 mRNA levels were found (Figure S4b-c). The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was
similar when comparing active smokers to non-smokers, either between healthy controls or IBD patients
(data not shown) and no significant interactions with inflammation status, region or other covariates were
found. Thus, age and gender, but not smoking modulates ACE2 but not TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in
the IBD colon.

Non-biological medications: corticosteroids, thiopurines and 5-aminosalicylates reduce ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 gene expression in the inflamed colon and rectum but not in the ileum
We further evaluated the impact of non-biologic and biologic medication use (self-reported) on the
expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA (Table S3) by propensity matching the MSCCR cohort (see
supplementary methods).
In the ileum of IBD (CD) patients, corticosteroid, thiopurine or 5-aminosalicylate use had no
impact on ACE2 mRNA expression in either inflamed or uninflamed biopsies (Figure 3a-c). In the
rectum, however, a significant decrease in ACE2 mRNA expression was observed with corticosteroid use
in inflamed biopsies. A similar decrease of ACE2 mRNA was noticed in thiopurine-treated non-inflamed
samples from the rectum. The use of corticosteroids, thiopurine or 5-aminosalicylate did not significantly

affect TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in ileum samples. However, each of these three medications
significantly decreased TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in inflamed rectum or colon samples. Thus,
corticosteroid, thiopurine or 5-aminosalicylate attenuated ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in
inflamed colon and rectum.

Among biologic medications, infliximab reduced ACE2 expression in the inflamed colon while
ustekinumab increased ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the inflamed colon in treatment responders
We also defined the effect of current anti-TNF therapy (either adalimumab or infliximab) use on ACE2
and TMPRSS2 (Figure 3d) expression. In the ileum, patients taking anti-TNF biologics did not show
significantly different ACE2 or TMPRSS2 mRNA expression compared to those not on anti-TNF
medication. In the large intestine, anti-TNF users showed increased ACE2 and TMPRSS expression,
particularly in the inflamed rectum. Since the use cross-sectional cohort to study treatment effect has its
limitations, we utilized published datasets from clinical trial cohorts, where longitudinal patient sampling
was performed and information on endoscopic responses to treatment was available.
The results from a patient cohort treated with infliximab or vedolizumab on the GEMINI LTS
trial20 are summarized (Figure 4a and S5). Compared to baseline ACE2 expression, post-infliximab
(week 6) colonic ACE2 gene expression was significantly lower and this decrease was observed
predominantly in endoscopic responders (Figure S5). In contrast, post-vedolizumab (week 6) ACE2 gene
expression did not significantly change, although a nominally significant decrease was observed in
endoscopic responders (Figure 4a and S5). Finally, neither vedolizumab nor infliximab modified
TMPRSS2 expression.
To study the impact of IL-12/IL-23-targeting ustekinumab on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA
levels in IBD, we used the CERTIFI trial cohort19, 27. We first confirmed that, as in our MSCCR cohort,
ACE2 gene expression was higher in uninflamed ileum compared to the colon regions (Figure S6a).
Next, we observed that ileal ACE2 gene expression was significantly decreased with inflammation as was
observed in the ileal samples from both MSCCR and RISK cohorts (Figure S6a). In colonic and rectal
samples, a trend to increase ACE2 expression in inflamed biopsies as compared with non-inflamed was
observed (Figure S6a).
Following ustekinumab treatment, ACE2 gene expression was increased (nominal significance)
in the inflamed tissue (both small and large intestinal) after week 6 post ustekinumab as compared to the
screening biopsy (Figure 4b, Figure S6b) contrasting with a decrease in expression in placebo-treated
patients. Upon examining expression by ustekinumab response at week 22, the increase of ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 expression was mainly observed in the colon and was stronger in responders (foldchange=1.79, p=0.055 for ACE2 and fold-change= 2.25, p=0.024 for TMPRSS2, Figure S6c). Thus,

TNF-targeting biologics attenuated ACE2 mRNA expression in the inflamed colon, whereas IL-12/IL-23targeting biologics increased both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in the inflamed colon,
particularly in therapy responders.
Overall, the effects of IBD medications on ACE2 and TMRSS2 mRNA is complex, region-specific and
drug-specific. A summary of the medication effects is provided in Figure 4c.

Intestinal ACE2 gene regulatory subnetworks are enriched in metabolic functions and interferon
signaling in the inflamed colon
To identify potential functions associated with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the gut, we studied these genes in
the context of Bayesian gene regulatory networks (BGRN). These probabilistic graphical models consider
all available trait data (gene expression and genotype) simultaneously in order to derive gene:gene casual
relationships amongst thousands of intermediate molecular traits28.
The nearest neighbors of ACE2 were extracted including genes within either 3 to 5 path lengths
in each BGRN network (5 networks total) keeping the subnetwork sizes relatively similar (~200-300
genes, Figure 5a, 5d, Table S7). Immediate neighbors of ACE2 in the ileum CD network included
SLC6A19 (a known interacting partner of ACE229), and other SLC transporters but also other viralassociated receptor proteins, like DPP4 and EZR30. A summary of the recurring genes across subnetworks
is shown (Figure 5b, 5e).
Functional enrichment of ACE2-associated subnetwork was interrogated in the ileum (Figure 5c)
or colon (Figure 5f) using the Reactome database. Identified metabolic pathways included SLC-mediated
transport; xenobiotic metabolism; vitamins and cofactors; and hexose transport. Additional ileumassociated pathways included amino acid and oligopeptide SLC transporters, while colon-associated
networks included interferon and immune signaling.
To support our network approaches we verified a significant overlap was observed between the
colonic ACE2-associated subnetworks and genes reported to be correlated with ACE2 expression in
colonocytes26 (Figure S7a). In addition, ACE2-subnetworks were significantly enriched in expression
profiles associated with epithelial cell types, including enterocytes and absorptive cells23, 24 (Figure S7bc). Colonic ACE2-associated subnetworks also co-enriched in immune cell types as well as macrophage
gene signatures following various cytokine perturbations including IFNγ/β25 (Figure S7d). In summary
our ACE2-subnetworks are a novel source of insight into the regulation and function of ACE2.

Intestinal TMPRSS2 gene regulatory subnetworks are predominantly enriched for metabolic
functions

To address the function of TMRPSS2, the subnetworks associated with TMPRSS2 were extracted from
the BGRNs (Figure S8a) allowing three or four layers to obtain similar subnetworks sizes (~200–300
genes). TMPRSS2 was not found in the BGRN from the ileum of controls, likely due to a low expression
variance, which is a filter used before BGRN network construction (Table S13). Genes recurring in 4 of
4 subnetworks were identified (Figure S8b). TMPRSS2-associated subnetwork genes are enriched for
cell-cell communication, tight junction interaction, O-linked glycosylation of mucins and membrane
trafficking-associated pathways (Figure S8c). Consistent with these functions, we observed enrichment
of the TMPRSS2 subnetworks in genesets associated with enterocytes, goblet and secretory cells (Figure
S9 a-b).

A subset of pathways associated with SARS-CoV2 response and IBD inflammation overlap
COVID-19 is a multisystem disorder where innate and adaptive immune cells as well as non-immune
cells likely play a role in disease pathogenesis. Therefore, apart from alterations in the receptor
expression, we investigated additional areas of overlap between COVID-19 responsive pathways and
pathways associated with IBD. As the first step, we examined a host molecular response signature
generated following SARS-CoV-2 infection of a primary human lung epithelium (NHBE) cell and a
transformed lung alveolar cell line (A549)31. Using GSVA, we generated a per-sample score summarizing
expression of either up or down-regulated COVID-19-responsive genes, and evaluated differences in
these scores according to intestinal region, disease and inflammation status (Figure 6a and S10 a-b).
Genes up-regulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection show significantly higher expression in inflamed regions
as compared to uninflamed regions or non-IBD control subjects, an observation confirmed in the
CERTIFI CD cohort (Figure S10c-d). We directly compared the genes associated with response to lung
cell SARS-CoV2 infection and various IBD-centric genesets generated in our MSCCR cohort32 or IBD
GWAS genes. We observed that genes: up-regulated with inflammation, or positively associated with
macroscopic or microscopic measures of disease, or associated with the risk of IBD, were significantly
enriched with genes up-regulated by SARS-CoV2 infection of lung epithelial cells (Figure S10e).
Next, we examined for the congruence of COVID-19 related peripheral blood gene responses32
and active IBD inflammation. We observed that genes up-regulated in the blood of COVID-19 infected
patients have significantly higher expression in the blood of IBD patients as compared to healthy control
blood (Figure 6b and Figure S11a) as well as in patients with active IBD versus quiescent IBD (Figure
6b and Figure S11b).

BGRNs (Table S17). We then determined the overlap between them, with the rationale that common
gene membership implies similar molecular pathobiologies. We observed a significant overlap between
IBD-Inf and NHBE-COVID_subnets across all three independent networks tested (Figure 6c).
Interestingly, the common genes (148 in ileum CD, 213 in Colon UC and 170 in Colon CD networks)
were significantly enriched in candidate IBD GWAS genes (Table S18).
To determine the underlying shared patho-biological mechanisms we evaluated enrichment of the
three intersecting subnetworks against Reactome pathways. Interestingly, although subnetworks were
generated by projecting a COVID-19 response signature generated in an epithelial-based model the
majority of the pathways and cell type enrichments were immune oriented with the most striking related
to innate immune signaling via interferon and interleukin-6 (Figure 6d, Figure S12, Table S19). This is
consistent with the fact that while SARS-CoV-2 infection initiates within the epithelium, COVID-19 is a
multisystem disorder where innate and adaptive immune cells as well as non-immune cells likely play a
role in disease pathogenesis. Our COVID-19 associated gut subnetwork findings are consistent with a
large body of recent data that describe a dramatic up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients
with COVID-1933 including induction of IFN-stimulated genes31.
We confirmed these observations using the recent dataset where SARS-CoV-2 was shown to
infect hSIOs34 (Figure S13a-b). Direct overlap of genesets from the SARS-CoV-2 infected hSIOs and
various IBD-centric genesets showed significant gene enrichments, similar to those observed between the
lung-COVID-19 model and IBD (Figure S13c). Finally, subnetworks generated in the ileum CD using
hSIO-COVID-19 responsive genesets (Table S20) overlapped with IBD-Inf associated subnetworks. The
intersecting genes were similar to those found between IBD-Inf and NHBE-COVID19-associated ileum
CD subnetworks, containing many interferon-stimulated genes (Figure S13d-e).
Next, as a data reduction approach, we evaluated each of the NHBE-COVID-19 and IBDInflammation molecular response subnetworks for key driver genes (KDGs). We then summarized the
KDGs across the three BGRNs and determined those shared by IBD inflammation and NHBE-COVID-19
molecular responses (Figure 6e, Table S21). The shared KDGs identified were interferon-stimulated
genes such as IRF1, GBP1/2, PARP14/9 and several of these were replicated in BGRNs from the RISK
and CERTIFI cohort including CXCL1, GBP4, PARP9 amongst others (data not shown).
We also compared the intersections between COVID-19 associated genes and those associated
with three different murine models of intestinal injury or inflammation. We observed a significant overlap
between genes up-regulated with COVID-19 response in the NHBE lung model with genes upregulated in
either a 1) Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) induced intestinal injury model35; 2) TNBS-intestinal injury
model36, especially two days post TNBS administration or 3) adoptive T cell transfer colitis model37
following a 6-week time period (ie W0<W2<W4<W6). Some examples of genes found commonly up-

regulated amongst the 3 IBD-mouse models and NHBE-COVID-19 response included C3, IFITM3,
IL1B, S100A9, TGM2 (transglutaminase 2) and PLAUR (plasminogen activator, urokinase receptor)
(Table S22).
Finally, we generated colonic or ileal gene subnetworks associated with response to infliximab or
ustekinumab (Table S23) and tested their enrichment in the tissue and IBD-type specific subnetworks and
observed significant overlap between many of the genes associated with IBD therapy and either IBDinflammation (used as positive control) or COVID-infection (Figure 6c) indicative of commonality
between COVID-19 and response to IBD treatment. We also evaluated changes in the activity of the
blood COVID-19 response signature in the blood of CERTIFI CD patients treated with ustekinumab and
observed that COVID-19 up-regulated genes significantly decreased after 4 weeks of ustekinumab
treatment (Figure S14a).
Altogether, through analyses of multiple genesets, we observed a significant overlap between
COVID-19 response genes and genes associated with IBD response.

Discussion
The objective of this study was to systematically determine the molecular intersections between COVID19-associated inflammation, IBD and immunomodulatory drugs. Our data provides mRNA- and proteinlevel evidence of the regional distribution of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 across different parts of the GI tract
and the impact of the commonly used IBD medications on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in the
inflamed and uninflamed intestines. Additionally, our data highlight an overlap between COVIDresponsive pathways and pathways associated with IBD inflammation. These findings generate the
possibility that some of the current and emerging therapies in IBD may be of benefit in patients with
COVID-19.
In exploring the intersections between COVID-19 and IBD, we initially considered a) impact of
inflammation on ACE2 expression and TMPRSS2 expression in the intestines; b) impact of IBD
medications on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression. ACE2 has a less appreciated RAAS-independent role
in the intestine by promoting amino acid absorption. Consistent with this function we observed high
levels of ACE2 expression in the small bowel brush border38-40 supportive of the role of ACE2 in mucosal
homeostasis39. Remarkably, the analyses of gene:regulatory networks empirically derived from the
terminal ileum, showed that ACE2 was co-regulated with SLC6A19, an amino acid transporter that
physically interacts with ACE241. The colon-derived ACE2 subnetwork would also suggest, a potential
metabolic role for ACE2 in the colon including solute carrier dependent processes.
While the physiological function of TMPRSS2 remains largely elusive, it has been linked to
epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) regulation42 and possibly in regulating sperm function43. In agreement

with literature42, our BGRN analysis showed SCNN1A, which corresponds to a subunit of the ENaC,
associated with TMPRSS2. Remarkably, gene products co-localized with TMPRSS2 were consistently
enriched in fundamental epithelial functions. For example, F11R, which encodes a JAM-A protein
mediates tight junction formation. Interestingly, we noted connections to viral responses. JAM-A is a
reovirus receptor44 and TRIM3145 and BAIAIP2L146 associate with mitochondrial anti-viral associated
proteins.
We have observed a reduction in ACE2 expression in the inflamed ileum. Since ACE2 appears to
be a brush-border enzyme, its reduction with inflammation in the ileum is consistent with loss of
expression of other brush border enzymes during enteritis47. That said, even during inflammation, the
expression of ACE2 remains significant in the small intestines. In contrast, inflammation associated with
IBD enhances the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the rectum. Overall, modulation of ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 by IBD-associated inflammation is complex and appears to be region-specific in the intestines.
Akin to the impact of inflammation on intestinal ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression, the effect of
IBD medications was complex. Corticosteroids, thiopurines or 5-aminosalicylates did not significantly
affect TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in the ileum. However, each of these three medications significantly
decreased TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in inflamed rectum or colon samples.
Importantly, while SARS-CoV-2 infection initiates with the viral attachment to ACE2 and its
cleavage by TMPRSS2 within the epithelial surfaces7-10, COVID-19 is a multisystem disorder where
innate and adaptive immune cells as well as non-immune cells likely play a role in disease pathogenesis.
Therefore, apart from alterations in the receptor expression, we investigated additional areas of overlap
between COVID-19 responsive pathways and pathways associated with IBD.
Notably, a number of such intersections appeared. For example, IL6, CXCL1/2/5, PDPN,
S100A8/A9 which were upregulated following SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary human lung epithelium
(NHBE)31 were also significantly upregulated in the inflamed intestines of patients in our IBD cohort
(MSCCR). Similarly, a peripheral blood gene signature from COVID-19 patients48 which included the
upregulated genes, CLEC4D, S100A8/A9 and FCAR (aka CD89), were also significantly upregulated in
the blood of our MSCCR patients with IBD (as compared to controls) and in patients with active IBD (as
compared to patients with quiescent disease). Additionally, a number of SARS-CoV-2-associated genes
were upregulated in murine models of intestinal injury with DSS35 (DAPP1, PDPN, IL1RN, DUOX2,
IL1B, S100A9, CXCL2, CXCL3) or TNBS36 (MARCKSL1, IFITIM3, IFITIM1, C3, AGR2, REG4) or
adoptive T cell transfer colitis model37 (TAP2, MARCKSL1, SLP1, PARP9, IFITIM3, MMP13, IL1B,
S100A8). These genes relate to a number of IBD-relevant pathways including those associated with
inflammatory cytokine signaling (including IL-6, IL-1, IFN-G), chemokine signaling, but also with

interferon-associated pathways, regulation of complement cascade, G protein coupled receptor (GPCR)
signaling as well as collagen degradation.
Having observed significant molecular intersections between COVID-19- and IBD-associated
pathways, we next examined the impact of biologic medications used in IBD therapeutics where pre- and
post-treatment transcriptomic data was available. Interestingly, our network analyses had identified a
number of shared COVID-19 and IBD-associated ‘key driver genes’, including CXCL1, GBP4, SOCS3,
PARP14 and PARP9. Importantly, we observed that these KDGs which were up-regulated with COVID19 and IBD inflammation, were all down-regulated following infliximab treatment. Thus, the impact of
IBD medications on attenuating some of the key inflammatory genes and pathways would be independent
of their complex effects on the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 on enterocytes.
Given the unregulated inflammatory responses in patients with severe COVID-19, it has been
argued that targeted use of anti-inflammatory medications be considered as a therapeutic option49. This
approach has been met with variable success. While the use of dexamethasone has provided a striking
mortality benefit50, the results of trials using anti-IL-6 have been equivocal (NCT04320615) and
NCT04372186. An anti-TNF trial is currently underway in the UK (NCT04425538). Our data suggest
that anti-IL-12/23 therapy could also be considered in the therapeutic armamentarium in patients with
COVID-19. Reassuringly, real-time data from a registry of IBD-COVID patients51 did not report
significant adverse outcomes associated with the use of biologic medications including anti-TNF and antiIL-12/23 inhibitors. To the contrary, the risk of severe COVID-19 was found to be reduced in IBD
patients on anti-TNF inhibitor medication, although the results of such population-based studies should be
interpreted with caution51.
In summary, through detailed analyses of intestinal tissues in health and IBD, we conclude that
high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 potentially supports local, GI-associated replication of SARSCOV-2. Further, a number of overlapping inflammatory pathways between COVID-19 and IBD are
noted. These data support the use of specific anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of patients with
COVID-19.
