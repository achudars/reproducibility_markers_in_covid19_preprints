COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread throughout the world and was declared a pandemic by
the World Health Organization, thus leading to a rapid surge in the efforts to understand
the mechanisms of transmission, methods of prevention, and potential therapies. While
COVID-19 frequently manifests as a respiratory infection,1 there is evidence for infection of
the gastrointestinal (GI) tract1-4 with documented viral RNA shedding in the stool of
infected patients.2,4 In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression of ACE2 and
TMPRSS2, which are required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into mammalian cells,5 from singlecell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets of five different parts of the GI tract:
esophagus, stomach, pancreas, small intestine, and colon/rectum.

Methods
We utilized previously published scRNA-seq data, which are summarized in
Supplementary Table 1. For in-house normal colon samples, a total of 7 patients were
recruited at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center through written informed
consent following Institutional Review Board approval. Single cell dissociation, library
generation, and sequencing were performed following standard protocols described in
Supplementary Materials.

Results
Analysis of scRNA-seq was performed separately for each GI segment and
available cell identities from the original studies were assigned to the new clusters after
confirming the expression of relevant marker genes (Figure 1). Overall, there were 82,422
cells from the esophagus, 18,405 cells from the stomach, 13,407 cells from the pancreas,

9,858 cells from the small intestine, and 20,161 cells from the colon and rectum
(Supplementary Table 1). The proportions of cells expressing ACE2 were approximately
16-fold lower in the upper GI tract (esophagus, stomach; 1% or 1,004/100,827 cells) than
in the lower GI tract (ileum, colon, rectum; 16% or 4,777/30,019 cells), and overall, higher
proportions of cells expressed TMPRSS2 than ACE2 throughout the GI tract
(Supplementary Figures 1A-E).

Of note, higher proportions of esophageal columnar cells – which were mostly from
Barrett’s esophagus samples – co-expressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2, compared to the
native squamous epithelium (Figure 1A). Pancreatic ductal and acinar cells co-expressed
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 but endocrine cells did not show detectable co-expression (Figure
1C). Parenthetically, the expression of TMPRSS2 in acinar cells underscores the rationale
for using a TMPRSS2 inhibitor (camostat mesylate) in acute pancreatitis. In fact, this agent
is now undergoing early phase clinical trials in COVID-19 patients.5

Taken together, within the GI tract, the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2
transcripts was highest in the small intestine and colon. Approximately 20% of enterocytes
from the small intestine and 5% of colonocytes (enterocytes from colon/rectum) coexpressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Figure 1D-E). Analysis of 308 genes that were positively
correlated (Pearson’s r > 0.1) with ACE2 in the small intestine revealed the enrichment of
functional Gene Ontology (GO) terms such as metabolic and transport pathways in the
small intestine (Supplementary Figure 1F), thus confirming the inherent digestive and
absorptive functions of enterocytes. Interestingly, 251 genes positively correlated with
ACE2 in the colon and rectum showed enrichment of not only secretion-associated

pathways but also immune-related processes (Supplementary Figure 1G), which may be
upregulated in functional colonocytes due to the microbiome.

Discussion
To summarize, our results confirm the co-expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a subset of epithelial cells in the GI tract, especially functional
enterocytes from the lower GI tract (small intestine and colon), and provide potential
insights into why entero-colitic symptoms may arise in acute COVID-19 infection. These
findings parallel the findings from recent studies that revealed the co-expression of ACE2
and TMPRSS2 in olfactory epithelium6 and intrahepatic cholangiocytes,7 which may
explain atypical COVID-19 symptoms and laboratory findings such as anosmia/ageusia
and transaminitis. Our results further support the feasibility of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the
GI tract with implications for GI infection and transmission.
