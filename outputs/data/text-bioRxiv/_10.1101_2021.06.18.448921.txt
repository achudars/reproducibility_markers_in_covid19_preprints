Abstract
Drug repurposing can expedite the process of drug development by identifying known drugs
which are effective against SARS-CoV-2. The RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is
a promising drug target due to its pivotal role in viral-host attachment. These specific structural
domains can be targeted with small molecules or drug to disrupt the viral attachment to the host
proteins. In this study, FDA approved Drugbank database were screened using a virtual
screening approach and computational chemistry methods. Five drugs were short listed for
further profiling based on docking score and binding energies. Further these selected drugs
were tested for their in vitro biological activity. There was significant correlation between the
prediction from computational studies and the actual RBD-ACE2 binding inhibition by the
drugs. Then, we performed a series of studies that mimic some of the biological events seen in
COVID-19 patients such as secretion of IL1β, presentation of a more thrombogenic
endothelium by production of thrombomodulin and accumulation of inflammatory cells such
as monocytes in the lungs. Of all the drugs, most promising drug was Ertugliflozin which is
used for type-2 diabetes. This drug possesses several desired properties and may be a good
candidate for immediate repurposing for treatment of COVID-19.

1. Introduction
World Health Organization has now declared COVID-19 a global pandemic actively spreading
around the world. COVID-19 caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, can cause symptoms such as
fever, cough, pneumonia, nausea, and fatigue, and death due to severity of symptoms and
associated co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, etc. As of now, SARS-CoV-2 has
reached almost all countries around the world, with more than 121 million confirmed cases and
around 3 million deaths as of March, 2021 [1]. The mechanism of COVID-19 effect is believed
to be that it binds its host’s cellular receptors through, homo viral surface trimeric spike
glycoprotein (S-protein) with human host cell surface angiotensin-converting enzyme
(hACE2) receptor and membrane fusion, necessary for viral entry into the host cell [2]. The
entry of the virus into the host cell requires the spike or S-protein to be cleaved in two steps.
The first step is the binding of the virus to the ACE2 protein and this is accomplished by the
cellular proteases acting at the region between S1 and S2, namely, the transmembrane serine
protease TMPRSS2. S1 and S2 subunits are responsible for viral-receptor binding and virushost cell membrane fusion, respectively. The S1 subunit bears the receptor-binding domain
(RBD) on its C-terminal domain. The RBD itself contains the receptor-binding motif (RBM),
which actually comes into contact with the carboxypeptidase domain of the ACE2 molecule.
In the spike protein, there is unique furin cleavage site which was not found in SARS-CoV.
This site makes the virus more adaptable for cleavage by other cellular proteases as well, thus
making it able to infect more cell types. This cleavage step is required for the initiation of
membrane fusion by the S2 subunit, and this involves a second site of cleavage on this site,
which is now considered essential to activate the S2 protein [3].
Mitigation of COVID-19 by drugs prophylactically and therapeutically has become the focus
of pharma industry research. To this end, in early 2020, many anti-viral compounds were
proposed [4], natural products were reported [5] and now, vaccines are being developed [6].
It is agreed universally that drug-repurposing is a safe and best approach towards treatment of
COVID-19. Drug repurposing refers to the identification of novel applications for an approved
or investigational/experimental drug outside the premise of its original indication. At present,
this strategy would be a logical choice for developing a new drug for COVID-19 considering
the substantial time-scales associated with new drug discovery and the trial-based validation of
its safety and efficacy. The major advantage of repurposed drug is that it has been already
evaluated for safety in human trials, which would reduce the significant amounts of time and
money, a priority concern in SARS-CoV-2 drug development.
Application of in silico techniques in early stages of drug discovery either through conventional
or repurposing approaches aid in minimizing the chances of the failures. The SARS-CoV-2
virus is closely related to the SARS-CoV and this allows utilization of the known protein
structures to quickly build a model for drug discovery to search for possible medications for
the SARS-CoV-2. The aim of the present study is to in silico identify clinically approved drugs
treating various diseases of human importance, which would then be pharmacologically
evaluated for targeting the RBD domain of the S-protein of COVID-19 as well as their antiinflammatory and anti-thrombogenic properties.
The RBD domain of S-protein is an attractive and well characterised drug target in corona
viruses owing to the pivotal role it plays in the entry of the virus into the host cell. Targeting
this specific structural domain with repurposed drugs to disrupt the COVID-19 viral attachment

to the host proteins. Much research has gone into finding drugs that can effectively prevent or
reduce viral-ACE2 interactions. Subsequently, testing their binding efficacy in in vitro assays
with RBD will elucidate the computational rationale for robust proposal of drug repurposing.
Screening the FDA approved drugs and antivirals from the Drugbank database through
molecular docking methodology would identify and prioritize repurposed drugs as potential
leads in order to avoid any bias towards a particular drug. The drugs identified by virtual
screening were then tested in a cell-free biochemical RBD-ACE2 binding study to validate
findings from virtual screening. In addition, the drugs were further profiled in cytokine
secretion and three dimensional (3D)-printed human-cell-based vascular lung model for
potential anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic activities which could be useful in treatment
of COVID-19.

2. Material and Methods
Cresset Flare software was used for molecular docking studies against the spike protein SARSCoV-2 (http://www.cresset-group.com/flare/) [7].
2.1 Ligand preparation
The 2D structures of all the drugs were downloaded from Drugbank database and prepared
using Flare software. Hydrogen atoms were added in the structure and atom force field
parameterization was assigned. Further, energy minimized was done for all the drugs, nonpolar
hydrogen atoms were merged, and rotatable bonds were defined. Later, ligand minimization
has been carried out in Flare by Minimize tool by using Normal calculation methods. Ligands
should also be prepared to assign proper bond orders and to generate the correct tautomer
and/or ionization state.
2.2 RBD structure preparation
The RBD of spike glycoprotein SARS-CoV-2 is used for present study. This RBD binds to
ACE2 receptor on the host cell with high affinity, which makes it a key target for the novel
coronavirus therapy development. The 3D structure of RBD binds to ACE2 receptor (PDB ID:
6M0J) were downloaded from Protein Data Bank (PDB) (https://www.rcsb.org). The protein
has two chain A and E, the A chain has ACE2 receptor and E chain has RBD domain. The
RBD domain has been save in to PBD format for further studies. The target protein preparation
was carried out in Flare software with default settings. Missing residues, hydrogen's and 3D
protonation were carried out on the target protein. Protein minimization has been carried out in
Flare by Minimize tool by using Normal calculation methods.
2.3 Computational analysis of binding sites
Binding site was generated Accelrys Discovery Studio visualizer 3.5 (Copyright© 2005-12,
Accelrys Software Inc.) to explore potential binding sites of the RBD protein using receptor
cavities tools. Based on a grid search and “eraser” algorithm, the program defines where a
binding site is. The binding sites were displayed as a set of points (point count) and the volume
of each of cavity was calculated as the product of the number of site points and the cube of the
grid spacing. Volume of each site were calculated and further saved and exported in to Flare
for advance analysis.

2.4 Docking with Lead Finder
The full-atom model of RBD was prepared and docking of ligands to the prepared model of
RBD in the active sites was performed using Flare (Lead Finder) software [8]. by default
configuration setting. The energy grid box for ligand docking was set at the geometrical centre
of the active site residues to span 10 Å in each direction. Two active sites were identified and
in each sites centre residues were picked to define the active site grid box. Lead Finder assumes
that the protein is rigid and analyses the possible conformations of the ligand by rotating
functional groups along each freely rotatable bond. For each ligand pose Lead Finder
determines values of the free energy of binding, the VS score, and the pose ranking score by
using its three built-in scoring functions. Three different scoring functions are available from
Lead Finder.
Rank Score: optimized to provide accurate prediction of 3D docked ligand poses.
ΔG: optimized to provide an accurate estimate of protein-ligand binding energy, on the
assumption that the pose is correct.
VS: optimized to provide maximum efficiency in virtual screening experiments, with a
maximum discrimination between active and inactive compounds in virtual screening
experiments.
The database drugs were docked in the RBD domain of S-protein SARS-CoV-2 by using
Cresset Flare Docking software with accurate and slow mode. The best poses were generated
and visualized in pose viewer and 3D images stored in storyboard.
2.5 RBD-ACE2 biochemical assay
The above assay was performed using SARS-CoV-2 sVNT ready to use kit by Genscript, which
is a competition ELISA, mirroring the viral neutralization process. In the first step, a mixture
of horse radish peroxidase-RBD (HRP-RBD) and controls/drugs (drugs at the concentrations
of 50µM, 100µM and 200µM) were incubated at 37oC for an hour to allow the binding of drugs
to HRP-RBD. Following the incubation, these mixtures were added to a capture plate, which
was a 96 well microplate coated with human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor to permit the binding of
any unbound HRP-RBD and the ones bound to drugs to ACE2 receptor. After incubating the
microplate at 37oC for an hour, plate was washed four times using wash buffer in order to
remove any unbound circulating HRP-RBD drug complexes. Washing step was followed by
addition of a colour substrate; tetramethyleneblue (TMB), turning the colour to blue. The
reaction was allowed to run for 15 minutes followed by the quenching using stop solution
turning the colour from blue to yellow. This final solution was read at 450 nm. The absorbance
of the sample is inversely proportional to the inhibition of RBD’s binding to ACE2 by the drug.
Data is presented as percent inhibition relative to untreated wells.
2.6 Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion assay
Human IL-1β ELISA was performed to detect the presence of IL-1β which is a key mediator
of inflammatory response. The ELISA was performed using Human IL-1β high sensitivity kit
from Invitrogen. The sample of ELISA used in the present study consist of cell culture media
(referred to as sample hereafter) collected after treating the cells with drugs at 100µM. Samples
were added to the microplate precoated with human IL-1β antibody which captures the IL-1β
present in the samples. A secondary anti-human IL-1β antibody conjugated to biotin was added

to the plate. Following an overnight incubation, microplate was washed six times using wash
buffer in order to remove any unbound biotin conjugated anti-human IL-1β antibody.
Streptavidin-HRP was then added which binds to biotin conjugated antibody and the plate was
incubated at room temperature on a shaker for an hour. After the incubation, plate was washed
again following the same process as the previous wash step and an amplification reagent I was
added to the wells. Following the incubation of 15 minutes and a wash, amplification reagent
II was added. After incubation of half an hour in dark and a wash step later, a substrate solution
was added turning the colour to blue. After 15-20 minutes, the reaction was terminated using a
stop solution (turning the colour from blue to yellow). This final solution was read at 450nm.
The OD of the sample is directly proportional to the amount of human IL-1ẞ present in it.
2.7 Human Thrombodulin/BDCA-3 Immunoassay
Human Thrombodulin ELISA was performed using a ready to use sandwich ELISA kit by R
and D systems. Samples (media collected from our 3D vascular lung system) were added to a
microplate precoated with monoclonal antibody specific for human thrombodulin. This was
followed by an incubation of two hours (allowing any thrombodulin present in the sample to
bind to the monoclonal antibody), the plate was washed with wash buffer four times. After
washing an enzyme-linked monoclonal antibody specific for human thrombodulin was added
to the plate. Another wash step was performed in order to remove any unbound antibodyenzyme reagent after completion of two hours of incubation. A colour substrate was then added
turning the colour to blue. Reaction was quenched after 15-20 minutes using a stop solution
which turned the colour from blue to yellow. Absorbance was read at 450 with wavelength
correction set to 540 nm or 570 nm. Data is presented as amount of thrombomodulin in the
media.
2.8 3D vascular lung model
Cell culture
For the 3D vascular lung model three types of cell were grown:
1.
A549 cells were grown at 37o C in the growth medium DMEM (HIMEDIA #Cat NoAT007) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum under the atmosphere containing 5%
CO2. Cells were subcultured after reaching 80-90% confluence.
2.
HUVEC cells were grown at 37o C in the Endothelial cell basal medium-2 (LONZA

2.9 3D bioprinting
In the 3D-vascular lung model four layers were bioprinted, first layer was collagen layer, (30µl
of Rat tail collagen) was added to each well in 96 well plate and incubated for 1 hour in CO2
incubator at 37oC. After incubation, once the collagen is solidified A549 cells flask which has
reached 80-90% confluence were trypsinized and cells were counted with the help of

haemocytometer. Cell suspension was loaded into bioprinter syringe and A549 cells were
printed in each well of 96 well plate and the cells were incubated for 48 hours.
After 48 hours of incubation, previous A549 media was removed carefully and again 30µl of
Rat tail collagen coating solution was added to each well in 96 well plate and incubated for 1
hour in CO2 incubator at 37oC. After incubation, once the collagen is solidified HUVEC cells
flask which has reached 80-90% confluence was trypsinized. Cell suspension was loaded into
syringe and HUVEC cells were printed in each well of 96 well plate with help of 3D bioprinter
and the cells were incubated for 48 hours.
After 48 hours of incubation the media was removed and the final selected drugs from virtual
screening were added with LPS at 0.5 µg/ml and without LPS at the desired concentration.
Later, cells were incubated overnight. Next day the drugs were removed and the cells were
washed once with media. Endothelial cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 minutes
at 40oC. After fixing with paraformaldehyde, the cells were again washed with media.
MTT stained HL60 monocytic cells were added to each well in 96 well plate and incubated the
plate for one hour and the wells were then washed twice with the media and pictures were taken
of all the wells and the bound HL 60 cells were counted with the help of ImageJ, an open access
software platform.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Structure of the S-protein
The S-protein is in a state of trimeric form with three RBDs and in metastable pre-fusion
conformation that undergoes structural rearrangements to fuse the viral membrane with the
host human cell membrane. The RBD undergo hinge-like conformational movements when
attached with the ACE2 host receptor. The binding of virus particles to cell receptors on the
surface of the host cell is the initiation of virus infection; therefore, receptor recognition is an
important determinant of viral entry and a drug design target. The S-protein has two subunits
S1 and S2, RBD situated in the S1 subunit binds to the cell receptor ACE2 in the region of
aminopeptidase N. Full spike protein has 1,273 amino acids in length, and the amino terminus
and most of the protein is predicted to be on the outside of the cell surface or the virus particles.
A fragment that is located in the S1 subunit and spans amino acids 319–541 has the RBD
domain. S1 protein has N-terminal domain (13-305 amino acid residues) and the RBD domain
(amino acids 319-541), within the RBD domain there is one motif which makes complete
contact with the receptor ACE2, was referred to as receptor-binding motif (RBM) (437-508
amino acid residues). The RBM region is tyrosine rich. Among the 14 residues of RBM that
are in direct contact with ACE2, six are tyrosine, representing both the hydroxyl group and
hydrophobic ring, as shown in Figure-1. S2 is responsible for membrane fusion and comprised
of fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), heptad repeat 2 (HR2), transmembrane domain
(TM), and cytoplasmic domain fusion (CP), is responsible for mediating viral fusion and entry.
For all COVIDs, S is further cleaved by host proteases at the so-called S2’ site located
immediately upstream of the fusion peptide.

3.2 Identification of active sites
Our in silico strategy help us to design and screen the new drug targeting the S-protein that
contains key structural domains RBD which plays a pivotal role in viral-host attachment. One
such avenue of research is to find new repurposed drug that can attach to residues at the site of
binding of the RBD to the ACE2. In the current study we had discover several potential binding
sites for molecules that can occupy such druggable pockets so as to inhibit virus-ACE2 binding
in vitro. The X-ray model of the RBD was used to identify 3 possibly druggable pockets where
drugs might bind. The active site volume and binding surface area of three pocket is
representation in Table-1. Site-1 (S1-1) has the volume of 143.7 & site-2 (S1-2) has the active
site volume of 109.4, the last site-3 (S1-3) has active site volume of 87.46. Site-3 was too small
to accommodate ligands, so they could not be potential pockets. Based on size of active site
cavity site-1 & site-2 has been selected for further docking studies.

3.3 Virtual Screening (VS) with Lead Finder (LF)
After the identification of active sites, the VS was applied which allows a large chemical library
to be screened computationally against a specific drug target. All the database compounds were
subjected to docking using LF and the predicted binding poses were analysed. In the present
study, we used Structure-based Virtual Screening (SbVS) which uses molecular docking
techniques to screen large virtual libraries of database where all the molecules were docked in
the RBD domain of spike protein. The compounds are scored based on the predicted
interactions with the target protein and those with the top scores (hits) are selected for further
analysis. All the database drugs were docked in the spike protein SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6M0J
E-chain) by using Flare Docking module of Cresset software. For all the database molecules
less reasonable physicochemical parameters were discarded, leading to the selection of
candidates with good drug-like properties. Later, a virtual library of approximately 3458
compounds extracted from Drugbank database were used for further screening using Highthroughput virtual screening (HTVS) mode and top 100 molecules were finally docked in the
“slow & accurate mode”. All compounds were ranked based on their docking score values and
those with a score ≤ -8.0 and ligand having contact with more than one hydrogen bond in both
the active sites were taken forward for final docking in “slow & accurate mode” of Cresset’s
Flare Docking software.

3.4 Molecular Docking and Interaction Analysis
Docking analysis and visualization of virtual screening hit sled to the identification of several
drugs that bind selectively to the RBD site-1 and site-2. In our previous studies, we have
identified antiviral and kinase inhibitors as prospective targeted therapy for COVID-19 [9-10].
In this study rigorous in silico analysis through molecular docking analysis showed 5 drugs
have strong predicted binding affinities toward RBD domain in the S1 protein. Total 5 drugs
were identified based on rank score (RS), and binding energy (ΔG) and interaction with
important amino acids in both the active sites of protein. These include unrelated and distinct
set of approved drugs namely Levothyroxine, Iodipamide, Cromogilic acid, Iohexol and
Ertugliflozin , which has shown most favourable binding affinity toward RBD S- protein.
The docking results showed that some drugs bound to RBD site-1 and some bound to RBD
site-2. Our goal was to find those molecules which has great binding affinity towards both the
active sites. Detail binding analysis of selected drugs towards active site of spike protein
SARS-CoV-2 was studied in detail. Interaction analysis of drugs with spike protein SARSCoV-2 (RBD) were carried out to identify the compound having highest binding affinity with
target protein. Active site-1is encompasses of Arg454, Phe456, Arg457, Lys458, Glu465,
Arg466, Asp467, Ile468, Ser469, Glu471, Thr473, Gln474 and Pro491 amino acid residues,
while the site-2 encompasses the residues Leu335, Cys336, Pro337, Phe338, Gly339, Trp436,
Phe342, Asn343, Val362, Ala363, Asp364, Val367, Leu368, Ser371, Ser373 and Phe374
amino acid residues, as shown in Figure-2. Active site-1 is more hydrophobic in nature as
compare to active site-2.

Figure-2: Active sites of RBD domain of S1-1 and S1-2 of Spike protein.
The LF rank score is an indicator of the binding affinity of protein-ligand complex. The LF
rank for selected drugs in the pockets 1 & 2 is described in Table-1 & 2 respectively. The
binding orientation for each selected drugs having the least LF rank score, more negative LF
rank score represent the better affinity of the drugs against target SARS-CoV-2 S-protein.
Among the docking studies performed on drugs, all the drugs had effective binding interactions
with RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein in both the active sites. The LF rank score values
were in the range of -10.2 to -11.7 in the active site-1, while in active site-2 the LF rank score
range from -8.8 to -11.7 for all the identified drugs. The ΔG provide an accurate estimate of
protein-ligand binding energy, on the assumption that the pose is correct. For the selected drugs
the ΔG is range from -7.5 to -10.8 in site-1, while in site-2 the ΔG is range from -7.6 to -10.8.
The number of hydrogen bond and the number of amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 (site-1
& site-2) interacting with each drugs are given in Table-2 & Table-3. As shown in Figure-3,
the graph represents the correlation between rank score and binding energies of all the selected
drugs in RBD site-1 and site-2. All the drugs have more or less similar range of score and
binding energies.

From the detailed docking analysis, it is observed that the Ertugliflozin and Iodipamide drugs
have good LF rank score and ΔG in both the active sites. It is found that, these six drugs have
formed strong H-bond contacts with more than two to three amino acid residues along with
various hydrophobic interactions in spike protein resulting in increased binding affinity with
target protein. Table-2 and Table-3 shows the rank score, binding energy, and list of
interactions of the prioritized ligands with the site-1 and site-2 of the RBD.

Out of all the selected drugs, Ertugliflozin a Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2)
inhibitor showed best free energy and rank score toward the binding to the RBD domain of
spike protein of SARS-COV-2. SGLT-2 inhibitors, a new novel class of antidiabetics are used
to manage glucose levels in Type 2 Diabetes, promotes excretion of glucose thus reduce plasma
glucose levels. Our computational studies on the potential of various other SGLT-2 inhibitors
binding to the RBD domains resulted either similar or lower LF rank scores. The LF rank score
and ΔG for the other SGLT2 drugs in the RBD active site pockets S1-1 and S1-2 are described
in Table-4. Based on these observations we believe that the effects of Ertugliflozin are unique
for COVID-19.

Ertugliflozin has demonstrated most favourable binding affinity toward the RBD protein in
both the sites. Its belong to the class of potent and selective inhibitors of the Sodium-dependent
Glucose cotransporters (SGLT), more specifically the type-2 which is responsible for about
90% of the glucose reabsorption from glomerulus. The docking orientation of Ertugliflozin in
site-1 & site-2 is representation in Figure-4.
In site-1, Ertugliflozin showed conventional hydrogen bonds with Asp467, Ile468, Phe456
along with halogenic bond with Glu471 amino acid residue. The drug further stabilized by
strong cation-pi interaction with Lys458. In site-2, Ertugliflozin is involved in hydrogen
bonding interaction with Gly339, Asp364, Cys366, Arg509 amino acid residues. Additionally,
it has pi-pi interactions with Phe374. The drug was found placed proximal to various
hydrophobic amino acids such as Leu335, Trp436, Pro337, Phe338, Phe342, Val362, Ala363,
Val367 and Leu368.

Another drug, Iodipamide, which is used as contrast agent for cholecystography and
intravenous cholangiography is also showing good LF Rank score and ΔG in both the active
sites. In site-1, it makes three hydrogen bonding interactions with Arg457, Lys458, and
Arg466. Further, it also is involved in strong cation-pi interaction with Arg457. Interaction
analysis in active site-2 suggests that it has four hydrogen bonding interactions with Cys336,
Phe342, Asn343, Trp436 amino acid residues. Further it has making a close contact with
various hydrophobic interactions with Leu368, Asn440, Phe347, Arg509, Val367, Ser371 and
Ser373 amino acid residues, as shown in Figure-5.

3.5 Pharmacological evaluation of selected drugs in RBD-ACE2 binding assay
Top screened drugs from the in silico studies were evaluated biologically against RBD-ACE2
binding assay at various concentrations from 200µM to 50µM. In this ELISA assay, we have
tested the drugs ability to block the binding of biotinylated RBD to ACE2. The data are shown
as percent inhibition relative to binding observed in the absence of any drugs. As shown
Figure-6, most drugs had some degree of inhibition thus corroborating the in silico predictions.
Two drugs Iodipamide, Ertugliflozin showed excellent dose response inhibition that
approached more than 90% inhibition of binding of RBD to ACE2 and correlated well with the
in silico studies.

were performed to compare between percent inhibition shown by control and drugs.

3.6 Inhibition of IL-1β secretion
Further, we evaluated the effect of selected drugs on secretion of IL-1β a proinflammatory
cytokines that are observed during cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 patients. To induce
secretion of cytokines by the A549 lung cells, we used lipopolysaccharide/endotoxin (LPS) a
known stimulus for inflammation and thermogenesis in many studies. As shown in Figure-7,
there was a modest but significant increase in IL-1β secretion by LPS relative to untreated cells.
When the drugs were added together with LPS some of them blunted the induced secretion.
Almost all drugs showed moderate inhibition of LPS induced cytokine secretion. We became
specially interested Ertugliflozin since it’s an approved drug for type-2 diabetes and has large
body of safety data upon chronic use and has good potential for repurposing.

P<0.01; *P<0.05. Student’s t-tests were performed to compare IL-1β secretion between control
and LPS treated cells; and between LPS treated cells (acting as a control) and different drug
treated cells.
3.7 Effect of drugs on thrombodulin secretion, a procoagulant protein secreted by
endothelial cells
We next looked at effect of the drugs on thrombomodulin a cell surface and secreted protein
from endothelium which promotes blood clotting. We studied this protein since in more recent
studies it has become obvious that uncontrolled blood clotting is seen in COVID-19 patients
and could contribute to mortality. As reported in literature LPS induced the secretion of
thrombomodulin in the 3D bioprinted vascular lung model. Almost all drugs had some degree
of inhibition but continuing our interest in Ertugliflozin we were able to see that it blocks the
secretion of thrombomodulin by almost 40%, a very desirable property to possess for a drug
that can be repurposed for COVID-19 (Figure-8).

concentration).
3.8 Effect of drugs on adhesion of monocytes
We finally examined the effect of drugs on adhesion of HL60 monocytes to endothelium in our
vascular lung model. The recruitment of inflammatory cells such as monocyte is a common
feature seen in COVID-19 as an early step of disease onset. This monocyte accumulation may
greatly contribute to cytokine storm that is seen in this disease. As shown in Figure-9, some
of the drugs were able to modulate monocyte adhesion stimulated by LPS. Again focusing on
Ertugliflozin, it can be seen that it was able to reduce the impact of LPS (increase is 20 cell
count per field) relative to the increase seen in control cells (increase about 70 cell counts per
field). These data indicate Ertugliflozin has potential to modulate monocyte accumulation
observed during COVID-19.

*** P<0.001; ** P<0.01; *P<0.05. Student’s t-tests were performed to compare between the
control and drugs after treatment with LPS
There is an urgent need to identify a therapeutic for SARS-CoV-2 for blocking its spike protein
binding to the host’s ACE-2, and quick way of finding such is through drug repurposing. RBD
of S-protein plays a pivotal role in viral-host attachment and one of the potential target for
antiviral treatment against SARS-CoV-2. These specific structural domains can be targeted
with small molecules or drug to disrupt the viral attachment to the host proteins. In this study,
FDA approved drugs were tested for their inhibitory properties towards the COVID-19 S
protein (6M0J) using a virtual screening approach and computational chemistry methods.
Rigorous in silico analysis through molecular docking analysis showed all 5 drugs have strong
predicted binding affinities toward RBD domain in the S1 protein. All these also showed good
dock score and interaction with important amino acids along with various hydrophobic
interaction and were well fitted in both the active sites of protein. More importantly the
selection of drugs by computational modelling was corroborated in a series of in vitro studies.
The most important confirmation came from the assay that examined the direct binding of RBD
to ACE2. There was very significant correlation between the prediction from computational
studies and the actual binding assay. We then conducted a series of studies that mimic some of
the biological events seen in COVID-19 such as secretion of IL-1β, presentation of a more
thrombogenic endothelium by production of thrombomodulin and accumulation of
inflammatory cells such as monocytes in the lungs. In silico and in vitro studies demonstrate
favourably drug’s ability to modulate desirable properties, with Ertugliflozin standing out with
promising potential for drug re-purposing.

4. Conclusion
Repurposing approved pharmaceutical drugs provide an alternative approach for rapid
identification of potential drug leads. In the present study, we found Ertugliflozin, a drug used
for type-2 diabetes, seems to possess all desirable properties demonstrated by in silico and in
vitro pharmacological studies. This is an oral drug which works by blocking the activity of
SGLT2 (Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2) and prevents glucose reabsorption in the kidney.
This is used as a chronic treatment drug for diabetes, which means that its safety has been
thoroughly tested prior to approval. It is also readily available and could be repurposed
immediately. To avoid any glucose lowering in COVID-19 patients by this drug, a nasal
formulation can be developed which targets the lungs. This will also improve the potency and
efficacy against the infection while requiring lower doses. While the development of vaccines
will prophylactically prevent the infection we do not have targeted drugs once the disease
already sets in. Based on our work here we propose that Ertugliflozin is a strong candidate for
immediate repurposing for treatment of COVID-19 treatment. Since the in silico screening did
not identify other SGLT2 inhibitors in initial screening, we believe that the effects of
Ertugliflozin are unique to it and unlikely to be a class effect, but this needs to be examined in
separate studies. In conclusion, we propose that the disruption of the SARS CoV-2-RBD/ACE2

binding interface by Ertugliflozin and its associated anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic
properties could pave the way for it to be useful as a new COVID-19 treatment.
