Abstract
RNA helicases play pivotal role in RNA replication by catalysing the unwinding of
complex RNA duplex structures into single strands in ATP/NTP dependent manner.
SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single stranded positive sense RNA virus
belonging to the family Coronaviridae. The viral RNA encodes non structural protein
Nsp13 or the viral helicase protein that helps the viral RNA dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp) to execute RNA replication by unwinding the RNA duplexes. In
this study we identified a novel mutation at position 541of the helicase where the
tyrosine (Y) got substituted with cytosine (C). We found that Y541C is a destabilizing
mutation increasing the molecular flexibility and leading to decreased affinity of
helicase binding with RNA. Earlier we had reported a mutation P504L in the helicase
protein for which had not performed RNA binding study. Here we report that P504L
mutation leads to increased affinity of helicase RNA interaction. So, both these
mutations have opposite effects on RNA binding. Moreover, we found a significant
fraction of isolate population where both P504L and Y541C mutations were coexisting.
Introduction
SARS-CoV2 or the novel coronavirus 2019 is a member of the family Coronaviridae.
It is the seventh member of human coronaviruses of this family. There is no vaccine
or antiviral against this virus till date.
Coronaviruses are single stranded positive sense RNA viruses. The viral RNA has 5’
cap and a 3’ polyA tail and encodes two different classes of proteins, the structural
and the non-structural proteins [1]. The structural proteins participate in forming the
structure of the virus particle whereas the non-structural proteins play crucial roles in
various steps of the virus life cycle after entry into the host cells. After the virus enters
the host cell, the virus undergoes uncoating and the viral genetic material is released
in the host cell cytoplasm where the viral positive sense RNA undergoes translation to
form the various viral proteins. The viral proteins are formed in the form of polyprotein
that gets processed by host cell proteases and viral protease. Followed by synthesis
of viral non-structural proteins the viral RNA undergoes replication. Replication is
important as this gives rise to new viral RNA strands that get later packaged into

progeny virus particles. The viral RNA replication is primarily aided by two proteins,
the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the viral helicase.
Helicase protein is important for executing viral RNA replication wherein this enzyme
catalyzes unwinding of complex RNA structures/ duplex structures into single strand
for RdRp to initiate RNA synthesis [1]. The unwinding of viral RNA is accomplished in
an ATP dependent fashion. Since RNA helicase plays a very important role in viral life
cycle it is also one of the major therapeutic targets.
In this study we have compared SARS-CoV-2 helicase protein sequences from
different geographical locations to identify possible mutations that might have emerged
and propagated in the population in significant fractions. Such variants that are
significantly high in number and have managed to survive the selection pressure might
have important role in virus adaptation and evolution. Thus, such mutant proteins need
to be characterized in depth to understand the role of such mutations in the viral life
cycle. These mutants could be potential therapeutic targets or handles for better
therapeutic interventions. Or, identification of the mutation hot spots in such crucial
proteins could help identify the conserved regions of the protein that could be targeted
in a generic fashion.
Methods
Sequence source
1549 SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13/helicase sequences were downloaded from GenBank. Out
of these 1361 sequences were from North America, 5 from South America, 139 from
Asia and 44 from Europe. These numbers reflect the full sequences with high
coverage and available in annotated forms in the GenBank. For the current study,
YP_009725308.1 was used as the wild-type sequence/ reference.
Sequence Alignments
The sequences with respect to SARS-CoV-2 helicase were aligned using multiple
sequence alignment tool of CLUSTAL Omega in batches.
Protein motif scan and homology modelling
Protein domain search and motif scan were performed using PROSITE (ExPASy
Bioinformatics resource portal) and MOTIF search servers respectively. Homology
modelling for the mutant helicases were performed using SWISS-MODEL homologymodelling pipeline’s structure assessment tool [2] using the existing SARS-CoV-2
helicase model [ID: 6jyt.2.pdb] as the wild-type template. Template was selected
based on maximum sequence similarity with the mutant helicase sequences.
Secondary structure
CFSSP (Chou and Fasman secondary structure prediction) server was used to predict
the secondary structures of SARS-CoV2 wild-type and mutant helicases.
Protein structure stability and RNA binding

mCSM NA was used to detect the effect of mutations on helicase-RNA binding.
Structural stability was assessed using two different tools, SAAMBE 3D [3] and
MUPro.
Protein dynamics
To study the effect of mutation on the stability and flexibility of the helicase protein, the
available SARS-CoV-2 helicase structure was uploaded on DynaMut software
(University of Melbourne, Australia) [4]. Change in vibrational entropy; the atomic
fluctuations and deformation energies due to mutation were determined.
Results and Discussion
Function of RNA helicase is important in the viral RNA replication process as it
unwinds the RNA duplex into single strands so that the RdRp can carry out RNA
synthesis. Thus, helicase compliments the function of RdRp. Here, we studied 1549
sequences corresponding to SARS-CoV-2 RNA helicase from different geographical
locations. Sequence alignments and comparison with reference sequence form China
revealed two amino acid positions that were mutated in more than 400 samples in
case of each type. These mutations accounted to nearly 27-30% of the total
sequences analysed (Figure 1) although this number might further change with more
sequences been checked. Both these mutations were found to co-exist in 409
sequences of the North American isolates. At position 504 of the helicase, proline (P)
was replaced by Leucine (L) (mutation P504L) and at 541 position, tyrosine (Y) got
mutated to Cysteine (C) (mutation Y541C). In our earlier study we had reported
mutation at position 504 but had not characterized the same in depth with respect to
location of mutation and effect on RNA binding [5]. To check the location of these
mutations on the helicase protein, we subjected the sequence of SARS-CoV-2
sequence to motif scan (Figure 1C, D). We found that the mutation P504L was located
at the second AAA domain (between residues 486 to 575). AAA family of domains
have conserved modules which bring together active site elements of adjacent
subunits for ATP hydrolysis [6]. This is required for generation of mechanical force for
translocation of substrate which in case of SARS-CoV2 helicase should be the RNA
duplex that needs to unwind for the replication to initiate or progress. Thus, a mutation
in this domain could have modulatory function on RNA replication by possibly
modulating either the efficiency of ATP hydrolysis or the dynamics/speed of RNA
unwinding. In a report by Wei et al, it was shown that a P to L mutation in the ATPase
p97 showed enhanced ATPase activity [6] and desensitized this protein against its
inhibitors. In another study by Lin et al it was demonstrated that a mutation from P to
L in the reverse transcriptase domain of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) increased replication
competency of the enzyme [8]. Although in our study the location of mutation and the
enzyme are different than those of cited studies, it supports the likelihood that P504L
mutation might lead to better helicase activity and thus might in turn enhance or
expedite RdRp activity by better RNA unwinding and translocation processes.

The mutation P541C lie in the RNA helicase C terminal domain. Effect of this mutation
on RNA binding and protein stability was studied and has been described later.
There is no crystal structure available to study structural biology of SARS-CoV2
helicase biology. Thus, to visualize these mutations in the context of 3D structure and
future use for molecular docking studies, we generated homology models of P504L
helicase and Y541C helicase using 6JYT.2 model available in SWISS MODEL
repository as template. We selected the model/s based on maximum sequence
similarity with the available template (Figure 2). These homology models could be
used for detailed structure analyses, molecular docking studies and also target search

in future by us as well as by others. Hence, these models will be deposited in public
database for use. Here, we visualized the mutations in the context of full-length protein
in 3D format using these structures. The mutations appeared to locally change the
conformation of the helicase domain. Thus, we looked for alterations in the secondary
structure of the protein using Chou and Fasman secondary structure prediction tool
(Figure 3). In case of P504L, at the level of secondary structure there were loss of
turns and introduction of helices and sheets as published earlier [5]. For mutation
Y541C, a single helix was introduced (Figure 3).

Changes in secondary structure can potentially alter stability of a protein. Thus, to
study the function of mutant helicases, first we checked for the effect of mutations on
the protein stability. Protein stability assessment using two independent prediction
tools revealed similar results. Y541C mutation destabilized the helicase whereas
P504L mutation could increase the stability of the protein. To correlate the structural
modulation by these mutations with the function, we ran RNA binding analyses using
mCSM NA server (Figure 4). RNA binding studies revealed that the replacement of
tyrosine with cysteine decreased the affinity of the helicase protein for RNA template.
Normal mode analysis/ protein dynamics study supported the mCSM data that the
protein stability decreased and there was increase in protein flexibility for Y541C
mutation (Figure 5). Atomic fluctuation and deformation energies complimented the
observations. On the other hand, interestingly, mutation P504L increased both solvent
accessibility and RNA binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 helicase.

Overall, this study revealed circulation of two mutations in the helicase protein of the
SARS-CoV-2 viruses in a significant fraction of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Our analyses
indicated possible role of at least one of these mutations in enhancing affinity of
helicase RNA interaction and thus replication. To further validate this model, these
mutations could be incorporated in helicase protein and assayed for effect on RNA
unwinding activity. Further, careful epidemiological surveillance and sequence
analyses from more isolates would help understand the significance of these variants
or lineages in evolution and spread of this virus. Such variants if found more virulent
in nature could be specifically targeted focussing on the mutant helicase to design
therapeutic candidates.
