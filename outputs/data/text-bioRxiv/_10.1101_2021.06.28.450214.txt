ABSTRACT

25

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged at the

26

end of 2019 and has been responsible for the still ongoing coronavirus disease 2019

27

(COVID-19) pandemic. Prophylactic vaccines have been authorized by the United

28

States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of COVID-19.

29

Identification of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) is important to assess

30

vaccine protection efficacy, including their ability to protect against emerging SARS-

31

CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC). Here we report the generation and use of a

32

recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 USA/WA1/2020 (WA-1) strain expressing Venus and a

33

rSARS-CoV-2 expressing mCherry and containing mutations K417N, E484K, and

34

N501Y found in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein of the

35

South African (SA) B.1.351 (beta, β) VoC, in bifluorescent-based assays to rapidly and

36

accurately identify human monoclonal antibodies (hMAbs) able to neutralize both viral

37

infections in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, our bifluorescent-based system accurately

38

recapitulated findings observed using individual viruses. Moreover, fluorescent-

39

expressing rSARS-CoV-2 and the parental wild-type (WT) rSARS-CoV-2 WA-1 had

40

similar viral fitness in vitro, as well as similar virulence and pathogenicity in vivo in the

41

K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mouse model of

42

SARS-CoV-2 infection. We demonstrate that these new fluorescent-expressing rSARS-

43

CoV-2 can be used in vitro and in vivo to easily identify hMAbs that simultaneously

44

neutralize different SARS-CoV-2 strains, including VoC, for the rapid assessment of

45

vaccine efficacy or the identification of prophylactic and/or therapeutic broadly NAbs for

46

the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

INTRODUCTION

71

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 at the end of 2019 has been responsible for the

72

COVID-19 pandemic 1. Despite numerous efforts to contain viral spread, SARS-CoV-2

73

disseminated worldwide and as of today it has been linked to over 175 million infections

74

and more than 3.8 million deaths around the world 2. To date, one antiviral drug

75

(remdesivir) and three human monoclonal antibodies (hMAbs) (Casirivimab/imdevimab,

76

Bamlanivimab/etesevimab, and Sotrovimab) have been approved by the United States

77

(US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of COVID-19 3-5. As of June

78

2021, six prophylactic vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been authorized by the US

79

FDA to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection 6-8. However, recent evidence suggest that newly

80

identified SARS-CoV-2 VoC are not efficiently neutralized by sera from naturally

81

infected or vaccinated individuals 9, raising concerns about the protective efficacy of

82

current vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 VoC 10-12.

83

To investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo, including tissue and cell

84

tropism and pathogenesis, recombinant viruses expressing a variety of reporter genes

85

have been generated. We and others have documented the generation of recombinant

86

(r)SARS-CoV-2 expressing fluorescent (Venus, mCherry, mNeonGreen, and GFP) or

87

luciferase (Nluc) reporter genes 13-16 and their use for the identification of neutralizing

88

antibodies (NAbs) or antivirals 14-19. Importantly, these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-

89

2 have been shown to have growth kinetics and plaque phenotype in cultured cells

90

similar to those of their parental rSARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WT). Current rSARS-CoV-2

91

have been genetically engineered to express the reporter gene replacing the open

92

reading frame (ORF) encoding for the 7a viral protein, an approach similar to that used

93

with SARS-CoV 16,20.

94

Recently, we described the generation of rSARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes

95

where the porcine teschovirus 1 (PTV-1) 2A autoproteolytic cleavage site was placed

96

between the reporter gene of choice and the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein 20. Three

97

major advantages of this new approach are: 1) all viral proteins are expressed (e.g. the

98

insertion of the reporter does not replace or remove a viral protein) 20; 2) high levels of

99

reporter gene expression from the N locus in the viral genome 20; and, 3) high genetic

100

stability of the viral genome in vitro and in vivo because of the need of the viral N protein

101

for genome replication and gene transcription 20. Importantly, this new approach allowed

102

the visualization of infected cells in vitro and supported tracking SARS-CoV-2 infection

103

in vivo 20. Notably, these new reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 exhibited WT-like

104

plaque size phenotype and viral growth kinetics in vitro, as well as pathogenicity in K18

105

human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice.

106

Using this strategy, we have successfully rescued Venus- and mCherry-expressing

107

rSARS-CoV-2 USA/WA1/2020 (WA-1) and a new rSARS-CoV-2 expressing mCherry

108

and containing mutations K417N, E484K, and N501Y present in the receptor binding

109

domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of the South Africa (SA) B.1.351 (beta,

110

β) VoC 12. Using rSARS-CoV-2 WA-1 expressing Venus and rSARS-CoV-2 SA

111

expressing mCherry, we developed a novel bifluorescent-based assay to readily and

112

accurately evaluate hMAbs able to specifically neutralize one or both viral variants.

113

Importantly, the 50% neutralizing titers (NT50) obtained with this new bifluorescent-

114

based assay correlated well with those obtained using individual viruses in separated

wells. Moreover, we also demonstrated the feasibility of using rSARS-CoV-2 expressing

116

different S and fluorescent proteins (FP) to rapidly identify hMAbs able to neutralize in

117

vivo both SARS-CoV-2 strains using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS). These new tools

118

will help advance our understanding of efficacy of current and future SARS-CoV-2

119

vaccines, as well as contribute to the identification of hMAbs with broadly neutralizing

120

activity against SARS-CoV-2 strains, including VoC, for the therapeutic or prophylactic

121

treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

RESULTS

139

Generation and characterization of rSARS-CoV-2 expressing FPs

140

The pBeloBAC11 plasmid encoding the full-length viral genome of SARS-CoV-2

141

WA-1 was used as backbone to generate the different rSARS-CoV-2 16,20,21. We

142

constructed new rSARS-CoV-2 reporter viruses that retained all viral genes by cloning

143

the Venus or mCherry FP upstream of the viral N gene using the PTV-1 2A

144

autocleavage sequence (Figure 1A) 20. Recombinant viruses expressing FPs using this

145

experimental approach based on the use of the 2A cleavage site from the N locus do

146

not require removing any viral genes 20, express higher levels of reporter gene

147

expression compared to those previously described from the locus of the ORF7a 20, and

148

are genetically more stable 20.

149

To characterize the newly generated FP-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 we first assessed

150

Venus and mCherry expression levels. Confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells were

151

infected (MOI 0.01 plaque forming units (PFU)/cell) with either rSARS-CoV-2 WT,

152

rSARS-CoV-2 Venus, rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry, or mock-infected, and then examined by

153

fluorescence microscopy (Figure 1B). As expected, only cells infected with rSARS-

154

CoV-2 Venus or rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry were detected under a fluorescent microscope

155

(Figure 1B). Cells infected with rSARS-CoV-2 WT, rSARS-CoV-2 Venus, and rSARS-

156

CoV-2 mCherry showed comparable levels of N protein expression (Figure 1C).

157

We next determined the multi-step growth kinetics of the newly generated rSARS-

158

CoV-2. Vero E6 cells were infected (MOI 0.01 PFU/cell) with rSARS-CoV-2 Venus or

159

rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry, individually or together, and tissue culture supernatants

160

collected over a course of 96 h to determine viral titers (Figure 1D). Kinetics of

161

production and peak titers of infectious progeny were similar for rSARS-CoV-2

162

expressing Venus or mCherry. Results from co-infection experiments using Venus- and

163

mCherry-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 indicated that both viruses had similar fitness under

164

the experimental conditions used (Figure 1E). This conclusion was further validated by

165

assessing FP expression in cells infected with rSARS-CoV-2 Venus and rSARS-CoV-2

166

mCherry, alone or in combination (Figure 1F). Moreover, both rSARS-CoV-2 Venus

167

and rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry exhibited similar plaque formation efficiency and plaque

168

size phenotype as the parental rSARS-CoV-2 WT (Figure 1G).

169

A bifluorescent-based assay for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs

170

We next assessed the feasibility of using these two FP-expressing rSARS-CoV-2,

171

alone and in combination, to identify NAbs against SARS-CoV-2. For proof of concept,

172

we used hMAbs 1212C2 and 1213H7, both previously shown to potently neutralize

173

rSARS-CoV-2 22,23. The NT50 values of 1212C2 against rSARS-CoV-2 Venus (0.97 ng)

174

(Figure 2A), rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry (1.20 ng) (Figure 2B), as well as rSARS-CoV-2

175

Venus and rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry together (0.86 ng and 0.88 ng, respectively) (Figure

176

2C) were similar to those reported using a natural SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 isolate 16,22. The

177

NT50 of 1213H7 against rSARS-CoV-2 Venus (2.19 ng) (Figure 2D), rSARS-CoV-2

178

mCherry (3.17 ng) (Figure 2E), and both, rSARS-CoV-2 Venus and rSARS-CoV-2

179

mCherry together (2.32 ng and 1.96 ng, respectively) (Figure 2F) were similar to those

180

obtained with the natural SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 isolate 16. These results demonstrated the

181

feasibility of using rSARS-CoV-2 expressing Venus and mCherry reporter genes in a

182

new bifluorescent-based assay to identify SARS-CoV-2 NAbs.

184

The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 VoC, including the SA B.1.351 (beta, β) 12, is a

185

major health threat since the efficacy of current vaccines against recently identified VoC

186

may be diminished. We sought to develop an assay that would allow us to evaluate the

187

protective efficacy of hMAbs against WA-1 and SA VoC within the same well. Towards

188

this objective, we generated a rSARS-CoV-2 containing the K417N, E484K, and N501Y

189

mutations found in the S RBD of the SA strain of SARS-CoV-2 and expressing also

190

mCherry, referred to as rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA (Figure 3A). The genetic identity of

191

the rescued rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Figure

192

3B).

193

Next, we aimed to characterize the rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA by assessing reporter

194

expression levels using rSARS-CoV-2 and rSARS-CoV-2 Venus as controls. Vero E6

195

cells were infected (MOI 0.01 PFU/cell) with rSARS-CoV-2 WT, rSARS-CoV-2 Venus,

196

or rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA, and expression of Venus and mCherry assessed by

197

epifluorescence microscopy (Figure 3C). Only cells infected with rSARS-CoV-2 Venus

198

or rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA were fluorescent. However, immunostaining with the

199

SARS-CoV cross-reactive N protein mMAb (1C7C7) detected cells infected with rSARS-

200

CoV-2 WT, rSARS-CoV-2 Venus and rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA (Figure 3C). Next, we

201

compared the growth kinetics of rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA and rSARS-CoV-2 Venus in

202

Vero E6 cells (Figures 3D-3F). Interestingly, at all hpi tested, tissue culture

203

supernatants from rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA infected cells had higher viral titers than

204

those from rSARS-CoV-2 Venus infected cells (Figure 3D), which correlated with a

205

higher number of mCherry than Venus positive cells in cells co-infected with rSARS-

206

CoV-2 Venus and rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA (Figures 3E and 3F). These results were

207

further confirmed when we assessed multiplication of rSARS-CoV-2 Venus and rSARS-

208

CoV-2 mCherry SA by plaque assay (Figure 3G). Larger plaque foci were observed in

209

cells infected with rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA compared to those infected with rSARS-

210

CoV-2 Venus (Figure 3G). We have also observed a similar fitness advantage of a

211

natural SARS-CoV-2 SA natural isolate over SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 24.

212

A bifluorescent-based assay to identify SARS-CoV-2 broadly NAbs

213

We next evaluated whether the rSARS-CoV-2 Venus and rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry

214

SA could be used in a bifluorescent-based assay to identify broadly NAbs, using the

215

1212C2 and 1213H7 hMAbs (Figure 2). Preliminary data using natural SARS-CoV-2

216

WA-1 and SA isolates showed that 1212C2 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 but not

217

SARS-CoV-2 SA VoC, while 1213H7 neutralized both viral isolates

218

1212C2 was able to efficiently neutralize rSARS-CoV-2 Venus (NT50 0.53 ng) (Figure

219

4A) but not rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA (NT50 > 500 ng) (Figure 4B), alone or in

220

combination (NT50 1.96 ng and > 500 ng, respectively) (Figure 4C). In contrast, 1213H7

221

was able to efficiently neutralize both rSARS-CoV-2 Venus (NT50 11.89 ng) (Figure 4D)

222

and rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA (NT50 6.54 ng) (Figure 4E), alone or in combination

223

(NT50 12.08 and 7.97 ng, respectively) (Figure 4F). These results demonstrated the

224

feasibility of using this novel bifluorescent-based assay to readily and reliably identify

225

hMAbs with neutralizing activity against both SARS-CoV-2 strains within the same

226

assay and that these results recapitulated those of experiments following individual viral

227

infections and classical neutralization assays using natural viral isolates.

230

sample, we assessed the neutralizing activity of a selected set of previously described

231

hMAbs 22. CB6, REGN10933, and REGN10987 hMAbs were used as internal controls

232

in the assay 25,26. CB6 (Figure 5A) and REGN10933 (Figure 5B) neutralized rSARS-

233

CoV-2 Venus (NT50 of 1.02 and 1.53 ng, respectively) but exhibited limited

234

(REGN10933, NT50 > 240.9 ng) or no (CB6, NT50 > 500 ng) neutralization activity

235

against rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA. On the other hand, REGN10987 (Figure 5C)

236

efficiently neutralized both rSARS-CoV-2 Venus and rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA (NT50

237

of 0.63 and 0.18 ng, respectively) (Figure 5C). Some of the tested hMAbs were also

238

able to specifically neutralize rSARS-CoV-2 Venus but not rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA,

239

including 1206D12 (NT50 0.58 and > 500 ng, respectively) (Figure 5D), 1212D5 (NT50

240

0.54 and > 500 ng, respectively) (Figure 5E), and 1215D1 (NT50 20.31 and > 500 ng,

241

respectively) (Figure 5F). We identified hMAbs with broadly neutralizing activity against

242

both rSARS-CoV-2 Venus and rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA, including 1206G12 (NT50 of

243

2.23 and 1.18 ng, respectively) (Figure 5G), 1212F2 (NT50 of 31.14 and 10.64 ng,

244

respectively) (Figure 5H), and 1207B4 (6.45 and 1.05 ng, respectively) (Figure 5I).

245

These results support the feasibility of this novel bifluorescent-based assay to identify

246

broad neutralizing hMAbs against different SARS-CoV-2 strains within the same assay.

247

An in vivo bifluorescent-based assay to identify SARS-CoV-2 broadly NAbs

248

Based on our in vitro results, we hypothesized that our novel bifluorescent-based

249

assay to identify NAbs against different SARS-CoV-2 strains could be adapted to

250

assess the neutralizing activity of hMAbs in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we assessed

251

the ability of 1212C2 and 1213H7 hMAbs to neutralize rSARS-CoV-2 Venus and

252

rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA, alone or in combination, in the K18 hACE2 transgenic

mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 6) 27. Mice were treated intraperitoneally

254

(i.p.) with 25 mg/kg of 1212C2, 1213H7, or an IgG isotype control 24 h prior to

255

challenge with 104 PFU of rSARS-CoV-2 Venus, rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA, or both

256

rSARS-CoV-2 Venus and rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA together. Body weight (Figure

257

6A) and survival (Figure 6B) were evaluated for 12 days post-infection (pi). IgG isotype

258

control-treated mice infected with rSARS-CoV-2 Venus, rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA, or

259

both rSARS-CoV-2 Venus and rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA together, exhibited weight

260

loss starting on day 4 pi (Figure 6A) and succumbed to viral infection between days 6

261

to 8 pi (Figure 6B). However, all mice treated with 1212C2 or 1213H7 survived

262

challenge with rSARS-CoV-2 Venus, consistent with efficient neutralization of SARS-

263

CoV-2 WA-1 in vitro by these two hMAbs (Figures 2 and 4). In contrast, only 1213H7,

264

but not 1212C2, was able to protect mice infected with rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA

265

(Figures 6A and 6B), consistent with the inability of 1212C2 to neutralize rSARS-CoV-2

266

mCherry SA in vitro (Figure 4). When mice were co-infected with both rSARS-CoV-2

267

Venus and rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA, only mice treated with 1213H7 retained their

268

initial body weight and survived infection (Figures 6A and 6B, right panels), similar to

269

results obtained using individual infections.

270

Use of FP expression to assess kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 multiplication in the

271

lungs of infected K18 hACE2 transgenic mice

272

We next examined whether FP expression could be used as a surrogate of SARS-

273

CoV-2 multiplication in the lungs of infected mice, providing a readout to assess the in

274

vivo protective activity of 1212C2 and 1213H7 hMAbs through IVIS (Figure 7). K18

275

or 1213H7 hMAbs, 24 h before infection (104 PFU/mouse) with rSARS-CoV-2 Venus

277

and/or rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA, singly or in combination. Mock-infected mice were

278

included as control. At days 2 and 4 pi, Venus and mCherry expression in the lungs was

279

evaluated using IVIS (Figure 7A) and quantified using Aura imaging software (Figure

280

7B). Excised lungs were also evaluated in a blinded manner by a certified pathologist to

281

provide gross pathological scoring (Figure 7A). Both Venus and mCherry expression

282

were detected in the lungs of mice treated with the IgG isotype control and infected with

283

rSARS-CoV-2 Venus and/or rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA, respectively (Figure 7A),

284

alone or in combination. Fluorescent signal increased from day 2 to day 4 pi in the lungs

285

of all IgG isotype control-treated infected mice (Figure 7B). Mice treated with 1212C2

286

and infected with rSARS-CoV-2 Venus showed no detectable Venus signal, indicating

287

that 1212C2 protects against rSARS-CoV-2 Venus infection (Figure 7A, top panel). In

288

contrast, 1212C2-treated mice infected with rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA expressed

289

mCherry in the lungs (Figure 7A, middle panel). In mice treated with 1212C2 and co-

290

infected with both rSARS-CoV-2 Venus and rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA, we observed

291

only mCherry expression, consistent with the ability of 1212C2 to neutralize rSARS-

292

CoV-2 Venus but not rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA (Figure 7A, bottom panel).

293

Corroborating our previous in vitro and in vivo results (Figures 4 and 6, respectively),

294

mice treated with 1213H7 were protected against infection with both rSARS-CoV-2

295

Venus and rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA, when administered alone or in combination, and

296

presented no detectable fluorescence in the lungs (Figure 7A). These data were further

297

supported by quantification of the average radiant efficiency of fluorescence signals,

298

which were high in the lungs of IgG isotype control-treated mice infected with rSARS-

CoV-2 Venus or rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA, and in the lungs of 1212C2-treated mice

300

infected with rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA (Figure 7B). Importantly, gross pathological

301

scoring correlated with levels of FP expression in the lungs of infected mice.

302

As predicted, IgG isotype control-treated K18 hACE2 transgenic mice infected with

303

rSARS-CoV-2 Venus (Figure 8A), rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA (Figure 8B), or both

304

rSARS-CoV-2 Venus and rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA (Figure 8C) presented high viral

305

titers. In contrast, lungs of 1212C2-treated and infected mice had undetectable levels of

306

rSARS-CoV-2 Venus (Figure 8A), but high titers of rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA when

307

mice were individually infected (Figure 8B) or co-infected with both viruses (Figure 8C).

308

In 1213H7-treated and infected mice, we did not detect rSARS-CoV-2 Venus (Figure

309

8A) or rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA (Figure 8B), including double infected mice (Figure

310

8C), consistent with the ability of 1213H7 to potently neutralize both viruses in vitro and

311

in vivo (Figures 4 and 6, respectively),

312

Lung homogenates from IgG isotype control-treated mice infected with both reporter

313

viruses contained ~25% and ~75% of Venus and mCherry, respectively, positive

314

plaques by day 2 pi. This finding suggested that rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA had a

315

higher fitness than rSARS-CoV-2 Venus in vivo (Figure 8D), which was similar to our in

316

vitro studies (Figure 3). Notably, by day 4 pi all viral plaques were mCherry-positive,

317

further supporting a higher fitness of rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA compared to rSARS-

318

CoV-2 Venus in vivo (Figure 8D). Lung homogenates from 1212C2-treated mice

319

contained rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA, reflecting the ability of 1212C2 to efficiently

320

neutralize rSARS-CoV-2 Venus but not rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA. In contrast, no viral

321

plaques were detected in lung homogenates from mice treated with 1213H7, as this

DISCUSSION

346

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 started at the end of 2019 1.

347

Despite US FDA-authorized prophylactic vaccines 6-8 and some, although still limited,

348

available therapeutic antiviral drugs (remdesivir) and neutralizing hMAbs

349

(Casirivimab/imdevimab, Bamlanivimab/etesevimab, and Sotrovimab) interventions 3-5,

350

over 175 million infections and more than 3.8 million deaths have been attributed to the

351

COVID-19 pandemic globally 2. As with other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is continuously

352

evolving, resulting in viral variants (e.g. VoC) that are becoming dominant within the

353

human population due to increased fitness, transmission and/or resilience against

354

naturally or vaccine induced immune responses. To date, several VoC have been

355

identified, including the United Kingdom B.1.1.7 (alpha, α) 28, SA B.1.351 (β) 12, Brazil

356

P.1 (gamma, γ) 29,30, India B.1.617.2 (delta, δ) 31, and California B.1.427 (epsilon, ε) 32.

357

There is limited information on the ability of current vaccines to protect against these

358

newly identified SARS-CoV-2 VoC 9,10,33. Moreover, it is likely that additional VoC will

359

emerge in the future.

360

Reporter-expressing recombinant viruses can circumvent limitations imposed by the

361

need for secondary methods to detect the presence of viruses in infected cells. These

362

reporter viruses have been used to evaluate viral infections, identify therapeutics, and to

363

study viral virulence in vivo. Here, we have documented the generation of novel rSARS-

364

CoV-2 to facilitate tracking infection of two different SARS-CoV-2 strains (WA-1 and SA)

365

in vitro and in vivo based on the use of two different FPs (Venus and mCherry,

366

respectively). The FP-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 encode the fluorescent Venus or

367

mCherry proteins from the locus of the N protein, without the need for deletion of any

16

368

viral protein 20. Notably, the use of this approach to generate FP-expressing rSARS-

369

CoV-2 resulted in higher FP expression levels than those afforded by rSARS-CoV-2

370

expressing FPs from the locus of the viral ORF7a protein 20. Moreover, rSARS-CoV-2

371

expressing reporter genes from the N locus are more genetically stable than those

372

expressing reporter genes from the ORF7a locus of the SARS-CoV-2 genome 20.

373

We showed that rSARS-CoV-2 expressing Venus or mCherry from the N locus

374

exhibited similar growth kinetics, peak titers, and plaque phenotype as the parental WT

375

rSARS-CoV-2 WA-1 strain. Importantly, we were able to use these novel reporter

376

rSARS-CoV-2 in bifluorescent-based assays to determine the neutralization efficacy of

377

hMAbs based on FP expression levels. We also generated rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA,

378

an mCherry-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 containing the K417N, E484K, and N501Y

379

mutations in the RBD of the S glycoprotein of the SA VoC. Notably, rSARS-CoV-2

380

mCherry SA had higher fitness than rSARS-CoV-2 Venus in cultured cells, as

381

evidenced by higher viral titers reached and a bigger plaque size phenotype.

382

Interestingly, when used in the bifluorescent-based assay, hMAb 1212C2 was unable to

383

neutralize rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA, but efficiently neutralized rSARS-CoV-2 Venus.

384

In contrast, hMAb 1213H7 displayed efficient neutralization of both rSARS-CoV-2

385

Venus and rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA. Importantly, these in vitro results correlated with

386

in vivo studies in which K18 hACE2 transgenic mice pre-treated with 1212C2 were

387

protected against challenge with rSARS-CoV-2 Venus but not rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry

388

SA, alone or in combination. In contrast, mice treated with 1213H7 were protected

389

against lethal challenge with both reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2, alone or in

390

combination. These protection results were corroborated through IVIS studies, in which

17

391

fluorescence and viral titers demonstrated the neutralizing protective efficacy of 1212C2

392

against rSARS-CoV-2 Venus but not rSARS-CoV-2 mCherry SA, while 1213H7

393

efficiently protected mice against challenge with both viruses, alone or in combination.

394

These results prove the feasibility of using both rSARS-CoV-2 Venus and rSARS-CoV-2

395

mCherry SA to accurately assess the ability of hMAbs to efficiently neutralize one or

396

both SARS-CoV-2 strains, alone or in combination, in vitro and/or in vivo, and establish

397

that the readouts of the bifluorescent-based assays correlate well with those of

398

individual viral infections.

399

rSARS-CoV-2 expressing FP or luciferase reporter genes have been described by

400

us and others 13-16, but in this study we have documented, for the first time, the use of

401

two rSARS-CoV-2 expressing different FP and S glycoproteins in a bifluorescent-based

402

assay to identify NAbs exhibiting differences in their neutralizing activity against different

403

SARS-CoV-2 strains present in the same biological sample in vitro and in vivo. Notably,

404

this approach can be extended to identify broadly NAbs against different SARS-CoV-2

405

VoC by generating rSARS-CoV-2 expressing additional FP and containing the S

406

glycoproteins of different VoC in multiplex-based fluorescent assays in vitro and/or in

407

vivo. These reporter rSARS-CoV-2 expressing the S glycoprotein of VoC also represent

408

an excellent option to investigate viral infection, dissemination, pathogenesis and

409

therapeutic interventions, including protective efficacy of vaccines or antivirals, for the

410

treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cultured cells and/or in validated animals models

411

of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS

415

Biosafety

416

Experiments involving the use of infectious SARS-CoV-2 were performed at

417

biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment laboratories at Texas Biomedical Research

418

Institute. All experiments using SARS-CoV-2 were approved by the Institutional

419

Biosafety Committee (IBC) at Texas Biomedical Research Institute.

420

Cells

421

African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero E6, CRL-1586) were grown and

422

maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%

423

fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1X PSG (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin,

424

and 2 mM L-glutamine), and incubated at 37ºC in an 5% CO2 atmosphere.

425

Generation of pBeloBAC11-SARS-CoV-2 encoding fluorescent proteins (FP)

426

The pBeloBAC11 plasmid (NEB) containing the entire viral genome of SARS-CoV-2

427

USA/WA1/2020 (WA-1) isolate (accession no. MN985325) has been described 20,21.

428

The rSARS-CoV-2 expressing Venus or mCherry from the locus of the viral N protein

429

using the PTV-1 2A autocleavage sequence were generated as previously described

430

20,21

431

receptor binding domain (RBD) within the spike (S) gene of the South African (SA)

432

B.1.351 (beta, β) VoC 12 and expressing mCherry was generated using standard

433

molecular biology techniques. Plasmids containing the full-length genome of the

434

different rSARS-CoV-2 were analyzed by digestion using specific restriction enzymes

435

and validated by deep sequencing. Oligonucleotides for cloning the Venus or mCherry

436

FP, or K417N, E484K, and N501Y mutations, are available upon request.

437

Generation of rSARS-CoV-2 expressing FP

438

Wild-type (WT, WA-1), Venus (Venus WA-1), and mCherry (mCherry WA-1)

439

reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2, as well as rSARS-CoV-2 encoding the SA B.1.351

440

(beta, β) mutations K417N, E484K, and N501Y in the S RBD expressing mCherry

441

(mCherry SA) were rescued as previously described 21,34. Briefly, confluent monolayers

442

of Vero E6 cells (1.2 x 106 cells/well, 6-well plate format, triplicates) were transfected

443

with 4 µg/well of pBeloBAC11-SARS-CoV-2 (WA-1), -2A/Venus, -2A/mCherry, or -

444

2A/mCherry-SA-RBD plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher). After 24 h

445

post-transfection, media was exchanged with post-infection (pi) media (DMEM

446

containing 2% FBS), and 24 h later cells were scaled up to T75 flasks and incubated for

447

72 h at 37ºC. Viral rescues were first confirmed under a brightfield microscope by

448

assessing cytopathic effect (CPE) before supernatants were collected, aliquoted, and

449

stored at -80ºC. To confirm the rescue of rSARS-CoV-2, Vero E6 cells (1.2 x 106

450

cells/well, 6-well plates, triplicates) were infected with virus-containing tissue culture

451

supernatants and incubated at 37ºC in a 5% CO2 incubator for 48 h. Viruses were

452

detected by fluorescence or immunostaining with a SARS-CoV N protein cross reactive

453

mouse (m)MAb (1C7C7). Plaque assays were used to determine viral titers (plaque

454

forming units, PFU)/ml). Viral stocks were generated by infecting fresh monolayers of

455

Vero E6 cells at low multiplicity of infection (MOI, 0.0001) for 72 h before aliquoted and

456

stored at -80°C.

457

Sequencing

460

extracted using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and used in RT-PCR

461

reactions to amplify a fragment of 1,174 bp around the RBD of the S gene. RT-PCR

462

was done using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and

463

Expand high-fidelity PCR system (Sigma-Aldrich). RT-PCR products were purified on

464

0.7% agarose gel and subjected to Sanger sequencing (ACGT). All primer sequences

465

are available upon request.

466

Immunofluorescence assays

467

Confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells (1.2 x 106 cells/well, 6-well format, triplicates)

468

were mock-infected or infected (MOI 0.01) with WT, Venus-, or mCherry-expressing

469

rSARS-CoV-2 WA-1 (WA-1, Venus WA-1, or mCherry WA-1, respectively); or rSARS-

470

CoV-2 mCherry SA. At 48 hours post-infection (hpi), cells were submerged in 10%

471

neutral buffered formalin at 4ºC overnight for fixation and viral inactivation, and then

472

permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room

473

temperature for 10 min. Thereafter, cells were washed with PBS before blocking with

474

2.5% bovine albumin serum (BSA) PBS for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with 1 µg/ml

475

of SARS-CoV anti-N mMAb 1C7C7 in 1% BSA at 37ºC for 1 h. Reporter-expressing

476

rSARS-CoV-2 were detected directly by epifluorescence and using either Alexa Fluor

477

594 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen; 1:1,000) or fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC)-

478

conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Dako; 1:200), depending on whether the viruses

479

express Venus or mCherry, respectively. Cell nuclei were detected with 4’, 6’-diamidino-

480

2-phenylindole (DAPI, Research Organics). An EVOS M5000 imaging system was used

481

to acquire representative images (10X magnification).

483

Vero E6 cells (1.2 x 106 cells/well, 6-well plate format, triplicates) were infected (MOI

484

0.01) at 37ºC for 1 h. After viral adsorption, cells were washed with PBS and incubated

485

at 37ºC in pi media. At 24, 48, 72, and 96 hpi, fluorescence-positive cells were imaged

486

with an EVOS M5000 fluorescence microscope for rSARS-CoV-2 expressing Venus or

487

mCherry FP, and viral titers in the tissue culture supernatants were determined by

488

plaque assay and immunostaining using the anti-SARS-CoV N mMAb 1C7C7. Mean

489

values and standard deviation (SD) were calculated with Microsoft Excel software.

490

Plaque assays and immunostaining

491

Confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells (2 x 105 cells/well, 24-well plate format,

492

triplicates) were infected with WT or reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 for 1 h before

493

being overlaid with pi media containing 1% agar (Oxoid) and incubated at 37ºC in a 5%

494

CO2 incubator. After 72 h, cells were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight at

495

4ºC. Next, overlays were removed, PBS was added to each well, and fluorescent

496

plaques were detected and quantified using a ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad).

497

Cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, blocked with

498

2.5% BSA in PBS for 1 h, and incubated with the SARS-CoV N mMAb 1C7C7, and

499

plaques detected using a Vectastain ABC kit and DAB HRP Substrate kit (Vector

500

laboratories) following the manufacturers’ instructions.

A bifluorescence-based neutralization assay

502

The hMAbs used in this study were generated and purified as described 22. CB6,

503

REGN10987 and REGN10933 hMAbs were included as controls 25,26. To test the

504

neutralizing activity of hMAbs, confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells (4 x 104 cells/well,

505

96-plate well format, quadruplicates) were infected (MOI of 0.01 or 0.1) with the

506

indicated rSARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at 37°C. After viral absorption, pi media containing 3-fold

507

dilutions of the indicated hMAbs (starting concentration of 500 ng/well) were added to

508

the cells and incubated at 37ºC for 48 h. Cells were then fixed in 10% neutral buffered

509

formalin overnight and washed with PBS, before fluorescence signal was measured and

510

quantified using a Synergy LX microplate reader and Gen5 data analysis software (Bio-

511

Tek). The mean and SD of viral infections were calculated from individual wells of three

512

independent experiments conducted in quadruplicates with Microsoft Excel software.

513

Non-linear regression curves and NT50 values were determined using GraphPad Prism

514

Software (San Diego, CA, USA, Version 8.2.1). Representative images were captured

515

with an EVOS M5000 Imaging system (Thermofisher) at 10X magnification.

516

Mouse experiments

517

All animal protocols were approved by Texas Biomed IACUC (1718MU). Six-to-

518

eight-week-old female K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)

519

transgenic mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and maintained in the

520

Animal Biosafety Laboratory level 3 (ABSL-3) at Texas Biomedical Research Institute.

521

All mouse procedures were approved by Texas Biomedical Research Institute IACUC.

522

To assess the in vivo efficacy of hMAbs, K18 hACE2 transgenic mice (n=5/group) were

523

anesthetized with isoflurane and injected (i.p.) with hMAbs IgG isotype control, 1212C2

524

or 1213H7 (25 mg/kg) using a 1 ml syringe 23-25 gauge 5/8 inch needle 24 h prior to

525

challenge with rSARS-CoV-2. For viral challenges, mice were anesthetized and

526

inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with 104 plaque forming units (PFU) of the indicated rSARS-

527

CoV-2 and monitored daily for morbidity as determined by changes in body weight, and

528

survival. Mice that lost greater than 25% of their initial weight were considered to have

529

reached their experimental endpoint and were humanely euthanized. In parallel, K18

530

hACE2 transgenic mice (n=3/group) were treated (i.p.) with 1212C2 or 1213H7 hMAbs

531

and challenged i.n. with 104 PFU of the indicated rSARS-CoV-2 for viral titer

532

determination. Viral titers in the lungs of infected mice at days 2 and 4 pi were

533

determined by plaque assay. In vivo fluorescence imaging of mouse lungs was

534

conducted using an Ami HT in vivo imaging system, IVIS (Spectral Instruments). Mice

535

were euthanized with a lethal dose of Fatal-Plus solution and lungs were surgically

536

extracted and washed in PBS before imaging in the Ami HT. Images were analyzed with

537

Aura software to determine radiance with the region of interest (ROI), and fluorescence

538

signal was normalized to background signal of lungs from mock-infected mice. Bright

539

field images of lungs were captured using an iPhone X camera. After imaging, lungs

540

were homogenized using a Precellys tissue homogenizer (Bertin Instruments) in 1 ml of

541

PBS and centrifuged at 21,500 x g for 10 min to pellet cell debris. Clarified supernatants

542

were collected and used to determine viral titers by plaque assay. Macroscopic

543

pathological scoring was determined from the percent of total surface area affected by

544

congestion, consolidation, and atelectasis of excised lungs, using NIH ImageJ software

545

as previously described 21,35.

546

Statistical analysis

547

All data are presented as mean values and SD for each group and were analyzed

548

using Microsoft Excel software. A two-tailed Student t test was used to compare the

549

means between two groups. A P value of less than 0.05 (P<0.05) was considered

550

statistically significant.
