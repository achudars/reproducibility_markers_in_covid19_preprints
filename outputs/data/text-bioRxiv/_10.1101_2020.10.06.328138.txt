ABSTRACT
Seven members of the Coronaviridae family infect humans, but only three (SARS-CoV, SARSCoV-2 and MERS-CoV) cause severe disease with a high case fatality rate. Using in silico
analyses (machine learning techniques and comparative genomics), several features
associated to coronavirus pathogenicity have been recently proposed, including a potential
increase in the strength of a predicted novel nuclear export signal (NES) motif in the
nucleocapsid protein.
Here, we have used a well-established nuclear export assay to experimentally establish
whether the recently proposed nucleocapsid NESs are capable of mediating nuclear export, and
to evaluate if their activity correlates with coronavirus pathogenicity.
The six NES motifs tested were functional in our assay, but displayed wide differences in export
activity. Importantly, these differences in NES strength were not related to strain pathogenicity.
Rather, we found that the NESs of the strains belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus were
markedly stronger than the NESs of the strains belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus.
We conclude that, while some of the genomic features recently identified in silico could be
crucial contributors to coronavirus pathogenicity, this does not appear to be the case of
nucleocapsid NES activity, as it is more closely related to coronavirus genus than to pathogenic
capacity.

INTRODUCTION
Seven members of the Coronaviridae family (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoVNL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43) are known to infect humans, but only the
first three cause severe disease. Identifying molecular determinants of coronavirus
pathogenicity is an important issue. In this regard, several genomic features that could
differentiate highly pathogenic coronaviruses from less pathogenic strains have been recently
identified in silico, using machine learning techniques and comparative genomics (1).
Eleven genomic regions corresponding to four different viral proteins, including the
nucleocapsid (N) protein, were found to predict a high pathogenic capacity, but the underlying
biological mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Interestingly, pathogenicity-associated
deletions, insertions and substitutions within the N protein mapped to four potential
nucleocytoplasmic transport motifs: three nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and one nuclear
export signal (NES). In highly pathogenic strains, these four motifs showed an increased
content of positively charged amino acids and were proposed to have an enhanced transport
activity (1). However, while a direct correlation between NLS activity and positive charge has
indeed been reported (2), such a correlation cannot be extrapolated to the NES motif. The
activity of NES motifs, (i.e. their ability to bind to the nuclear export receptor CRM1) crucially
relies on the presence of several hydrophobic (Φ) residues with a characteristic spacing (Φ0X(2)-Φ1-X(2-3)-Φ2-X(2-3)-Φ3-X-Φ4, where X represents any amino acid) (reviewed in 3). Importantly,
this NES “consensus” pattern is remarkably loose (4), and thus, predicting NES activity solely
from amino acid sequence is a notoriously challenging task (5).
A different, more carboxy-terminally located sequence in the N protein of SARS-CoV was
previously reported as a functional NES (6), but the more recently predicted motif (figure 1A)
has not been yet experimentally evaluated. Two necessary steps towards elucidating the
mechanism behind a potential relationship between the recently proposed nucleocapsid NESs
and coronavirus pathogenicity are (i) to establish if these sequence motifs are functional (i.e,
capable of mediating CRM1-dependent nuclear export) and, in that case, (ii) to determine if their
activity level (their strength) correlates with the pathogenic capacity of the corresponding viral
strain. To address these issues, we experimentally tested the NES motifs predicted in the N
protein of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43

strains (Figure 1B) using a well-established nuclear export assay (7). Our results validate these
sequences as functional NES motifs with different levels of nuclear export activity, and show
that differences in NES strength are related to genus (Alpha- or Betacoronavirus), but not to
pathogenicity of human coronavirus strains.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cloning procedures
The Rev(1.4)-GFP plasmid (7) was a gift from Dr. Beric Henderson (University of Sydney,
Australia). DNA sequences encoding coronavirus nucleocapsid NES motifs were purchased as
gBlocks (IDT), digested with BamHI and AgeI and cloned into Rev(1.4)-GFP. Constructs were
confirmed using DNA sequencing (StabVida).
Cell culture and transfection
HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (all from Gibco;
ThermoFisher Scientific) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. 24 hours
before transfection, cells were seeded in 12-well plates with glass coverslips. Transfections
were carried out using X-tremeGENE 9 DNA transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) following
manufacturer’s instructions.
Rev(1.4)-GFP nuclear export assay
Rev(1.4)-GFP plasmids with the different NES motifs (as well as the Rev(1.4)-GFP plasmid, as
negative control) were transfected into duplicated wells of HeLa cells. 24 hours after
transfection, 10 µg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) was added to all the wells to arrest protein
translation and thus ensure that any fluorescent signal present in the cytoplasm corresponds to
exported and not to newly synthesized GFP-tagged proteins. For each transfection, the cells in
one of the wells were additionally treated with 5 µg/ml actinomycin D (AD) to block nuclear
import mediated by Rev NLS and thus facilitate detection of weaker NESs (7). Both drugs were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. After 3 hours of incubation with the drugs, cells were fixed with
3.7% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min, washed with

PBS, and mounted onto microscope slides using DAPI-containing Vectashield (Vector
Laboratories). Slides were analysed using a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope. To
ensure unbiased assessment, the identity of the samples was masked before the analysis. At
least 200 transfected cells per sample were examined to establish the proportion of cells where
the reporter shows nuclear (N), nuclear and cytoplasmic (NC) or cytoplasmic (C) localization.
Based on this proportion, each of the tested motifs was assigned a nuclear export activity score
using the assay scoring system (7). Representative images were taken using a Zeiss Apotome2
microscope and Zen2.6 Blue edition software.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The Rev(1.4)-GFP assay (7) is a well-established method that has been used in numerous
studies to experimentally establish the functionality of potential NES motifs and to compare the
strength of different NESs. With this assay, functional NES motifs can be ascribed a score
ranging between 1+ (weakest) and 9+ (strongest). As shown in Figure 2, the novel predicted
NES motifs in the N protein of different human coronavirus strains tested here were all
functional in the export assay. Of note, the N protein of SARS-CoV has been reported before to
have a more carboxy-terminally located NES (6). The contribution of these sequences to the
localization of human coronavirus N proteins needs to be further investigated. On the other
hand, functional NES motifs have been also previously identified in the accessory proteins 3b
and 9b of SARS-CoV (8-10). The presence of functional NESs in viral proteins is a common
finding, and in fact, several viruses crucially rely on CRM1-mediated nuclear export of viral
components (either RNA or proteins) during various stages of their life cycle (reviewed in 11).
Together with previous findings (6, 8-10), our data support the possibility that nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling may play an important role, still to be determined, in the life cycle of human
coronaviruses.
Importantly, the six NES motifs tested here displayed a wide range of nuclear export activity
(scores between 1+ and 8+). However, in contrast to what has been proposed based on in silico
analyses (1), the differences in NES activity were not obviously related to pathogenicity (Figure
3). Rather, we found that the NESs of strains belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus (HCoVNL63 and HCoV-229E) were stronger (mean activity score= 6) than the NESs of the strains

belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoVOC43; mean activity score= 2).

CONCLUSION
We conclude that, while some of the features recently identified in silico (1) could be crucial
contributors to coronavirus pathogenicity, this is not the case of the activity of the nucleocapsid
NES motifs tested here, as it seems more closely related to coronavirus genus than to
pathogenic capacity.
