Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has escalated into a global crisis. The spike
(S) protein that mediates cell entry and membrane fusion is the current focus of vaccine and
therapeutic antibody development efforts. The S protein, like many other viral fusion proteins
such as HIV-1 envelope (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin, is glycosylated with both complex
and high mannose glycans. Here we demonstrate binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein by a
category of Fab-dimerized glycan-reactive (FDG) HIV-1-induced broadly neutralizing antibodies
(bnAbs). A 3.1 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of the S protein ectodomain bound to glycandependent HIV-1 bnAb 2G12 revealed a quaternary glycan epitope on the spike S2 domain
involving multiple protomers. These data reveal a new epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 spike that
can be targeted for vaccine design.

Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late
2019 and rapidly spread, causing a global pandemic of a severe acute respiratory syndrome
(COVID-19). The SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) utilizes a heavily glycosylated spike (S)
protein to bind its host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and mediate cell
entry and fusion (1). The S protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein composed of two functional
subunits responsible for receptor binding (S1 subunit) and membrane fusion (S2 subunit) (2, 3).
The surface of the virally encoded S protein is covered by host-derived glycans with each trimer
encoding 66 N-linked glycosylation sites (4).
Viral fusion proteins such as the spike proteins of diverse Coronaviruses, the HIV-1
envelope (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin (HA), are typically covered with high mannose and
complex glycans (5, 6). Viruses rely on host glycosylation machinery to synthesize and express
glycans, which cover the surface of proteins exposed on the virus and shield conserved
neutralization epitopes from immune surveillance. While genetic and somatic diversities can
preclude targeting protein epitopes for broad-spectrum neutralization, viruses may display
common carbohydrate moieties that can be targeted by glycan binding agents. Indeed, targeting
glycan moieties has been proposed as a general strategy for broad-spectrum virus
neutralization (7-9). While one concern with this general concept is that the glycan targeting
agents may have unfavorable cross-reactivity with human tissue by binding host carbohydrate
moieties, heavily glycosylated viral proteins, of which HIV-1 Env is an example, have significant
population of unprocessed oligomannose-type glycans that are not usually observed at high
abundance on secreted mammalian glycoproteins (10, 11). This divergence from host cell
glycosylation and the ‘non-self’ nature of these oligomannose glycans represent immunogenic
targets, and indeed a number of anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have been
isolated that specifically target gp120 glycans as part of their epitope (12-14).

Site-specific glycan analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein demonstrated 28% of
oligomannose-type glycans on the S protein surface (4). Here, we raised the hypothesis that the
glycan shield of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can be targeted by HIV-1 glycan-reactive
antibodies. We tested SARS-CoV-2 S protein for binding by HIV-1 bnAb 2G12 that binds a
glycan-only epitope on the HIV-1 Env (12, 15, 16), as well as by a panel of Fab-dimerized
glycan-reactive (FDG) antibodies. We have recently demonstrated that FDG antibodies are
common in the HIV-1 uninfected B cell repertoire, and they bound high mannose glycans on
HIV-1 Env, yeast and other environmental antigens (17).
Results
Binding of FDG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike
In a companion manuscript (17), we described highly prevalent FDG antibodies that
target the high mannose glycan shield of the HIV-1 Env. Here, we test members of this category
of antibodies for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. A SARS-CoV-2 S protein
ectodomain construct incorporating residues 1-1208 of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and
harboring two stabilizing proline mutations in the S2 domain, a foldon trimerization domain, as
well as C-terminal Twin Streptactin and His tags, were expressed and purified as described
previously from HEK-293F cells (Figure S1) (2). We tested three different groups of FDG
antibodies – (1) FDG antibodies that were isolated from SHIV-infected macaques and shown to
broadly neutralize HIV-1 isolates (DH851.1 – DH851.3, and DH1003.2); (2) FDG precursor
antibodies that were isolated from a HIV naïve human (DH1005), and SHIV infected (DH898.1
and DH898.4) or HIV Env vaccinated (DH717.1 – DH717.4, and DH501) macaques; and (3)
antibody 2G12 that forms a subcategory on its own as the only variable heavy (VH) domainswapped FDG antibody known to date. Antibody 2G12 is a bnAb that neutralizes heterologous
HIV-1 isolates and binds to a conformational glycan cluster on HIV-1 Env (15, 18, 19).

To test whether the FDG antibodies that bind the HIV-1 Env glycan shield can also
recognize the SARS-CoV-2 spike we performed ELISA and SPR assays (Figures 1 and S2S8). As a positive control in the ELISA assays we included antibody D001 (see methods) that
binds the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, and as a negative
control, antibody CH65 (20) that binds the influenza hemagglutinin. We observed binding of the
S protein to the RBD-directed antibody D001, whereas no binding was observed for negative
control antibody, CH65. All FDG antibodies tested bound the SARS-Cov-2 spike to varying
degrees (Figures 1, S2 and S3). To determine if these antibodies were targeting glycan
epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we tested binding of the antibodies to the S protein in
the presence of a high-mannose glycan (D-mannose) (Figures 1, S2 and S3). As expected, no
inhibition was observed for the D001 antibody that binds the S protein RBD epitope on the spike
protein. Both the non-VH domain-swapped DH851 clone antibodies (DH851.1 – DH851.3) that
have heterologous HIV-1 bnAb activity, and the VH domain-swapped antibody 2G12, bound the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein in a glycan-dependent manner (Figures 1, S2 and S3). Other rhesus
FDG bnAb (DH1003.2) and precursor (DH898.4, DH717.1 – DH717.3, and DH501) antibodies,
as well as human FDG precursor (DH1005), bound the spike protein and were inhibited by Dmannose to varying degrees. These results demonstrated specific binding of FDG antibodies for
glycans on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
To gain insight into the epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain targeted by the
FDG antibodies we chose 2G12 for structural determination in complex with the SARS-2 spike
ectodomain. While the non-domain-swapped FDG antibodies exist as mixtures of Y- and Ishaped forms (17), the VH domain-swapped 2G12 presents a 100% I-shaped population that
can be separated from its intermolecular dimer form by size exclusion chromatography (21) and
digested using papain to yield a stable domain-swapped Fab dimer amenable to structural
studies (Figure S7) (12, 15, 18, 19). The 2G12 Fab obtained by papain digestion of the 2G12

IgG (Figure S7) bound to SARS-CoV-2 spike with affinity of ~313 nM (Figure S8), and on- and
off-rates of 3.5 X 104 M-1s-1 and 1.19 X 102 s-1, respectively.
The FDG antibodies in Figure 1 as well as the HIV-1 bnAb 2G12 were tested in a SARSCoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization assay and were all negative starting at 50 µg/ml (data not
shown). Importantly, in none of the assays were enhanced numbers of viral plaques seen with
the addition of FDG antibodies.
Structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike bound to HIV-1 bnAb 2G12
To visualize the epitope of 2G12 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike we determined a cryoEM structure of the 2G12 Fab bound to a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain construct (2)
(Figures 2-6, S9 and S10; Table S1). The cryo-EM dataset obtained from 6804 micrographs
showed considerable compositional heterogeneity, revealing populations of unliganded spike,
as well as spike bound to 2G12 at 1, 2 or 3 of it binding sites (Figure S9). The 2G12-bound
spike was ~15% of the total population. We obtained cryo-EM reconstructions of the SARSCoV-2 S protein bound to a single 2G12 Fab at 3.3 Å from ~ 108,000 particles, and S protein
bound to two 2G12 Fabs at 3.2 Å resolution from ~110,000 particles. (Figure S9). We also
observed a smaller population (~42,000 particles) that showed occupancy at all three binding
sites, although the 2G12 density at one of the sites was substantially weaker than at the other
two. Even upon extensive 3D classification of this population, the weaker density at the third
site remained suggesting that this weak density was due to flexibility of the bound 2G12 rather
than partial occupancy. To maximize the resolution of the 2G12 interface with the SARS-CoV-2
spike, we performed 3D refinement by combining all 2G12-bound particles and using a mask
that focused the refinement on the S protein and one 2G12 Fab. On doing so, we obtained a 3.1
Å reconstruction of 2G12 Fab bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike (Figures 2 and S9; Table S1).
Fitting this map with the coordinates for the SARS-CoV-2 spike (PDB 6VXX) (3) and 2G12 Fab2
(PDB 6N35) (12), followed by iterative coordinate refinement and model building (22, 23)

yielded a model for 2G12 Fab2 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike that was used for further
analysis.
The local resolutions of the cryo-EM reconstruction spanned a range from 2.6 Å – 8.4 Å
(Figures 2C-D, and S10) , with the lowest resolutions observed at the receptor binding domain,
the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal ends of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and the constant
domain of the 2G12 Fab. The binding interface of 2G12 with the SARS-CoV-2 was well resolved
with the connecting glycans clearly visible in the electron density (Figure 2).
The VH domain swapped configuration of the 2G12 Fab-dimer (Fab2) was well-defined
in the electron density of the bound 2G12 (Figure 2A and B). This unique domain-swapped
architecture that has been described previously in a number of high-resolution structures solved
using x-ray crystallography or cryo-EM (12, 19, 24-27), results in the creation of two secondary
binding sites on either side of the VH/VH interface, in addition to the primary binding site at the
VH/VL interface (19). The cryo-EM reconstruction of the Fab2 fragment of 2G12 bound to the
SARS-Cov-2 spike revealed a quaternary epitope for 2G12 in the S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV2 spike with glycans from different protomers clustered together to form the 2G12 epitope
(Figures 2-4). Three S protein glycans were the primary contributors to the 2G12 binding
epitope – glycans 717 and 801 from one protomer and glycan 709 from the adjacent protomer
(Figures 3-5). The 2G12 Fab2 interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 spike buried a 1,500 Å2 area at
its interface with the epitope composed entirely of N-linked glycans with the primary binding
sites; each at one of the VH/VL interfaces, contacting glycans at positions N709 and N717
(Figures 1A–1C; see Figure S2 for glycan nomenclature). One of the two secondary binding
sites created as a result of the VH/VH domain swapping contacted the glycan at positions N801
(Figures 3 and 4).
Identification of a common epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein recognized by Fabdimerized glycan-reactive antibodies

Because glycan-only epitopes are expected to be more mobile than a protein epitope we
investigated the extent of disorder and motion in the position of the 2G12 bound to the S
protein. Heterogeneous 3D classification performed on the cryo-EM dataset using a mask
including the 2G12 density and S2 density, and excluding the S1 and the HR2 regions, revealed
two distinct 2G12 orientations that were related by a 9-degree angular displacement about a
hinge at glycan 709 (Figure 5A and B). To test the importance of this residue that appeared to
be a pivot point for the bound 2G12, a N709A glycan deletion mutant was expressed and
purified, and confirmed by NSEM to contain well-dispersed and properly folded spike particles
(Figure S1). Deletion of the glycan at position 709 resulted in abrogation of 2G12 Fab binding,
thus confirming that glycan 709 is critical for the binding of 2G12 to the SARS-Cov-2 spike
(Figure 5C).
We next tested the binding of the panel of non-domain-swapped FDG antibodies to the
N709A glycan-deleted mutant in an SPR assay. The N709 glycan deletion either abrogated or
substantially reduced the binding of the FDG IgGs tested (Figures 5D and S11), thus
suggesting a common epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 spike that is recognized by FDG antibodies.
Comparison of 2G12 binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike versus HIV-1 Env
The VH domain-swapped 2G12 has been shown to bind isolated Man9 glycans, and to
HIV-1 Env. In this study we demonstrate that 2G12 can also bind the SARS-CoV-2 S protein
(Figure 6A-D) (12, 19). While 2G12 can recognize free mannose in its non-domain-exchanged
form, it only binds the HIV-1 glycan shield if domain-exchanged, thus highlighting the
importance of avidity for its interactions with glycan clusters (27). The structure of 2G12 bound
to HIV-1 Env revealed binding sites for 4 HIV-1 Env glycans on 2G12 (15, 18), one each at the
two primary binding sites at the VH/VL interface and the other two at the secondary sites at the
VH/VH interface created as a result of domain-swapping (Figures 6B). Consistent with its
glycan-only epitope, 2G12 binding to a soluble HIV-1 Env construct is inhibited by D-mannose

(Figure 6D). In the structure of 2G12 Fab2 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, only 3 of these
glycan binding sites on 2G12 were occupied by spike glycans (Figure 6C) and, while 2G12
showed robust glycan-dependent binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, the binding was weaker
than for the HIV-1 Env (Figure 6D). Another noteworthy difference between the binding of 2G12
to HIV-1 Env versus is binding to SARS-CoV-2 S is that on the HIV-1 Env all the binding
glycans come from a single gp120 monomer in the HIV-1 Env trimer, whereas in the SARSCoV-2 S protein the binding site is quaternary and the 2G12-binding glycans at each site are
contributed by two of the three protomers, making this one of the first examples of a quaternary
epitope spanning multiple protomers on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (28), and the first in the S2
domain.
Discussion
In this paper we demonstrated that a category of prevalent glycan-reactive antibodies, termed
FDG antibodies, can bind to high mannose glycans on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein. FDG antibodies can bind to isolated high mannose glycans (17, 29) as well as high
mannose glycans on HIV-1 and on fungal pathogens such as Candida albicans and
Cryptococcus neoformans (17, 30). With HIV-1 infection in humans or SHIV infection of
macaques, FDG antibodies can be affinity matured to achieve heterologous breadth. While the
2G12 HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody has VH domain swapped architecture (12), this
architecture was so unique that 2G12 was the only antibody of its kind known for a long time.
However, we recently discovered non-domain-swapped FDG antibodies that dimerize without
VH domain swapping and are capable of broad HIV-1 broad neutralization, as shown for the
DH851 IgG clonal lineage antibodies (17). Here we show, in addition to 2G12 binding, that VH
domain swapping is also not required for FDG antibody recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein as demonstrated by its binding to the non-domain-swapped FDG antibodies. While the
HIV-1 Env-reactive FDG antibodies tested in this study do not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the

demonstration that a common epitope for FDG antibodies exists on the surface of the SARSCoV-2 spike, raises the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection may enjoin FDG precursors and
select for FDG affinity matured antibodies that evolve the capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2
via glycan recognition.
That FDG precursors are common in the human B cell repertoire demonstrates that they
are not deleted due to immune tolerance mechanisms (17). It has been previously postulated
that the 2G12 and other glycan-reactive HIV-1 antibodies are rare due to reactivity with selfglycans (31). In this regard, select HIV-1 glycan reactive antibodies have been shown to react
with the surface of immune cell subsets (32). Whether immune tolerance mechanisms will limit
the affinity maturation of FDG antibodies to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 is yet unknown.
These data along with the companion paper describing the category of FDG anti-HIV-1
antibodies raise the hypothesis that preexisting antibodies raised by high mannose-containing
environmental antigens such as fungi or host molecules can be co-opted by HIV-1 Env to
become HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies. Here we propose this same set of FDG
precursor antibodies might be able to be targeted by the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 in the setting
of COVID-19 disease or vaccination and induce SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. It will be
of interest to determine if FDG category of S-protein-reactive antibodies that can neutralize
SARS-CoV-2 can be isolated from COVID-19 infected or vaccinated individuals. In this regard,
Ng et al have demonstrated pre-existing S2 IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S-protein likely
induced by human CoVs that cause common cold syndromes. Some of these sera were able to
neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (33). However, it remains unknown if such pre-existing S2-protein
antibodies are glycan reactive.
In summary, we demonstrate the reactivity of a pool of glycan-reactive antibodies with a
quaternary epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. A key study will be to determine if FDG

antibodies can be recruited by vaccination to develop into antibodies that can play a preventive
role in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS –
Expression of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike
The SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain constructs were produced and purified as described previously
(2). Briefly, a gene encoding residues 1−1208 of the SARS-CoV-2 S (GenBank: MN908947)
with proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987, a “GSAS” substitution at the furin cleavage
site (residues 682–685), a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif, an HRV3C protease
cleavage site, a TwinStrepTag and an 8XHisTag was synthesized and cloned into the
mammalian expression vector pαH. All mutants were introduced in this background. expression
plasmids encoding the ectodomain sequence were used to transiently transfect FreeStyle293F
cells using Turbo293 (SpeedBiosystems). Protein was purified on the sixth day post transfection
from the filtered supernatant using StrepTactin resin (IBA) (Figure S1). Affinity purified protein
was run over a Superose 6/300 increase column. The purified protein was flash-frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80° C.

Glycan-dependent binding of FDG mAbs to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Recombinant Fabdimerized glycan (FDG)-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were tested for binding SARSCoV-2 trimer (lot 62KJ) in ELISA in the absence or presence of single monomer D-mannose
sugar. SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein was captured by streptavidin to individual wells of a
384-well plate, and serially diluted mAbs were tested for binding. ELISA binding assays were
optimized to use SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that was aliquotted and frozen upon production;
desired aliquots of frozen spike protein were thawed once at 37o and stored overnight at room
temperature. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and Man9-V3 and Aglycone V3 peptides were
captured via streptavidin on Nunc-absorb ELISA plates using PBS-based buffers and assay
conditions as previously described (34, 35). HIV-1 CH505TF SOSIP trimer and commerciallyobtained constructs of SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain (S1+S2 ECD, S2 ECD and RBD) (Sino
Biological Inc cat# 40589-V08B1 and 40590-V08B respectively and RBD from Genescript cat#

coated 30ng of streptavidin in 15µl at 2µg/ml or 30 ng of mouse anti-AVI-tag mAb in 15µl at
2µg/ml per well of a 384-well Nunc-absorb ELISA plate, sealed and incubated overnight at 4oC.
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (2µg/ml) were added to streptavidin in 10µl per well of a 384-well
plate for one hour at room temperature to facilitate protein capture. HIV-1 CH505TF SOSIP
trimer and SARS-CoV-2 S1+S2 ECD, S2 ECD and RBD spike proteins (2 µg/ml) were added to
anti-AVI mAb in 10µl per well of a 384-well plate for one hour at room temperature to facilitate
protein capture. Mouse anti-monkey IgG-HRP (Southern Biotech, CAT# 4700-05) or Goat antihuman IgG-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, CAT# 109-035-098) secondary
antibodies were used to detect mAb bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. HRP detection
was subsequently quantified with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by measuring binding

levels at an absorbance of 450nm; binding titers were reported as Log area under the curve
(AUC). Commercially obtained D-mannose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was used to outcompete
mAb binding to glycans on SARS-CoV-2; D-mannose solutions were produced in ELISA buffers.
Competition ELISAs with D-mannose were performed in two separate assays; each with [0.5M]
(data not shown) or [1.0M] D-mannose. Mouse-Human chimeric mAb D001 (SARS-CoV RBD
mAb; Sino Biological Inc Cat# 40150-D001) was used as a control mAb; D001 was tested at
2µg/ml and 2-fold serial dilutions (10x), in contrast to all other mAbs tested at 100µg/ml and 3fold serial dilutions (10x). Anti-influenza CH65 mAb was used a negative control mAb. We found
that goat serum containing buffer (Superblock) – PBS, 4% (w/v) whey protein (BiPro USA), 15%
normal goat serum (Invitrogen), 0.5% Tween 20, and 0.05% sodium azide (Sigma-Aldrich) –
inhibited binding of glycan-dependent FDG mAbs to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, whereas
positive control RBD-binding mAb D001 bound the spike protein in the presence of superblock.
ELISAs using superblock were previously described (36). Moreover, whereas the 2G12 from
Polymun bound to S protein in surface plasmon reasonance, it was less potent than the
recombinantly expressed 2G12 antibodies, and did not bind well in ELISA. Commercial 2G12
from Polymun is provided in a maltose (mannose) buffer.
Neutralization assays
The neutralization assays were performed using SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020, RVU
Lot: NR52281-20200314. Source material supplied by BEI resources, catalog number NR52281. Data are reported as PRNT50 or 50% reduction in foci count relative to back titer input
verification. Endpoint titer of a given dilution series is reported as the concentration of the lowest
continuous dilution with a foci count less than or equal to the 50% neutralization cutoff. All
experimental samples were assayed as at least duplicate dilution series. Virus input and internal
assay controls were within accepted tolerances.
Negative-stain electron microscopy

A 100 µg/ml final concentration of the spike was made in 1:1 ratio of 0.15% glutaraldehyde in
HBS pH 7.4 (20mM HEPES, 150mM NaCl) to 10% Glycerol in HBS, pH 7.4. After 5 min
incubation Tris pH 7.4 was added from a 1M stock to a final concentration of 0.075M to quench
the glutaraldehyde and incubated for 5min. The carbon coated grids (CF300-cu, EMS) were
glow discharged for 20sec at 15mA. A 5 µl of sample incubated on grid for 10-15 sec, blotted
and then stained with 2% uranyl formate. The antibodies were diluted in 0.02% Ruthenium red
in HBS pH 7.4. After 5-10min incubation, a 5 µl droplet loaded on a glow discharged carbon
coated grid, briefly rinsed with dH2O and then stained with 2% uranyl formate. Images were
obtained with a Philips EM420 electron microscope operated at 120 kV, at 82,000×
magnification and a 4.02 Å pixel size. The RELION program was used to perform class
averaging of the single-particle images.
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)
The binding FDG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike was assessed by surface plasmon
resonance on Biacore T-200 (GE-Healthcare) at 25°C with HBS-EP+ (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.05% surfactant P-20) as the running buffer. Binding was
measured in two different formats. In the first format (Figures S4 and S5A), SARS-CoV-2 spike
was captured on a SA chip and binding response was measured by flowing over IgG solutions.
The surface was regenerated between injections by flowing over 1M NaCl in 50mM NaOH
solution for 10s with flow rate of 100µl/min. In the second format (Figure S5B, S6, S11) IgG
were captured on an anti-Fc sensor surface and binding was assessed by flowing over solutions
of SARS-CoV-2 in running buffer. The surface was regenerated between injections by flowing
over 3M MgCl2 for 10s with flow rate of 100µl/min.
For determining affinity and kinetics of 2G12 interaction with SARS-CoV-2 spike,
single cycle kinetics analysis was performed on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein immobilized on a
streptavidin (SA) chip with five injections of 2G12 Fab, prepared by digestion with papain as

described previously (18), at 3.125 nM, 6.25 nM, 12.5 nM, 25 nM and 50 nM concentrations.
The data were fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model.
Cryo-electron microscopy
Cryo-EM sample preparation
Purified SARS-CoV-2 spike preparations were diluted to a final concentration of ~1 mg/mL in 2
mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3, were mixed with 6-fold molar excess of 2G12
Fab and incubated for 2 hours at room tempearture. 2.5 uL of protein was deposited on a CF1.2/1.3 grid that had been glow discharged for 30 seconds in a PELCO easiGlow™ Glow
Discharge Cleaning System. After a 30 s incubation in >95% humidity, excess protein was
blotted away for 2.5 seconds before being plunge frozen into liquid ethane using a Leica EM
GP2 plunge freezer (Leica Microsystems).
Cryo-EM data collection
Cryo-EM imaging was performed on a FEI Titan Krios microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
operated at 300 kV. Data were acquired with a Gatan K3 detector operated in counting mode
using the Leginon system. The K3 experimental parameters are 2500 ms exposure with 50
frames at 50 ms framerate with a total dose of 66.43 e-/A2 and a pixel size of ~1.058Å/px. This
system was also energy-filtered with a slit width of 20 eV. A total of 6804 images were
collected.
Cryo-EM data processing
Cryo-EM image quality was monitored on-the-fly during data collection using automated
processing routines. Individual frames were aligned and dose-weighted using MotionCor2 (37)
implemented within the Appion pipeline (38). Data processing was performed within cryoSPARC
(39) including particle picking, multiple rounds of 2D classification, ab initio reconstruction,

heterogeneous and homogeneous map refinements, and non-uniform map refinements.
Heterogenous classifications were performed within RELION (40) using masks produced in
Chimera.
Cryo-EM model fitting
Structure of the all ‘down’ state (PDB ID 6VXX) the previously published SARS-CoV-2
ectodomain, and a structure of the 2G12 Fab bound to Man1-2 (PDB ID 6N35) were used to fit
the cryo-EM maps in ChimeraX. Coordinates were then fit manually in Coot (23) following
iterative refinement using Isolde (22) and subsequent manual coordinate fitting in Coot.
Structure and map analysis was performed using PyMol and ChimeraX (41).
Data availability
The cryo-EM maps and fitted coordinates are in the process of being deposited to the electron
microscopy database (EMDB) and the RCSB Protein Data Bank, respectively. The sequences
of the FDG antibody heavy and light chain genes were deposited in GenBank as previously
described (17, 29)

(A) We tested mAbs for binding to recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in ELISA. Antibody
binding was assessed in the absence (-) or presence (+) of D-mannose [1M]. Serially-diluted
mAbs were tested for binding (also see Figure S2 and S3). Mouse anti-rhesus or goat antihuman IgG-HRP secondary antibodies were used to detect binding by rhesus or human mAbs,
respectively. Binding was measured at absorbance of OD450nm, whereas binding titers as Log
area under the curve were reported in Figure S1. Control antibodies were SARS-CoV-1 RBD
(D001) and influenza HA (CH65) mAbs. Data shown are from a representative assay. (B)
Binding of FDG antibodies to a set of commercially available constructs expressing the SARSCoV-2 S1 and S2 extracellular domain (left), S2 domain (middle), and the receptor binding
domain (right). Blue and red bars show binding in the absence and presence of D-mannose
[1M], respectively. Binding antibody titers are reported as area under the curve (AUC) and
were calculated using Softmax software. Data shown are from a representative assay. All
ELISAs (A-B) were done using BSA-based buffers (see methods).

resolved from the cryo-EM data by heterogeneous classification. Density for the two
observed states are shown in green and grey. (B) Cartoon representation of the SARS-CoV2 S-protein (bright green, bright orange, blue) and the two 2G12 orientations. The axis of
rotation is represented by a grey cylinder. (C) Binding of 2G12 Fab2 to (top) unmutated spike
and (bottom) N709A mutant. Binding of 2G12 Fab2 to the SARS-CoV-2 spike constructs was
measured by SPR using single-cycle kinetics. The black lines show the data and the red
lines the fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. (D) Binding of the unmutated spike and the
N709A mutant to a panel of FDG antibodies measured by SPR and shown as a heatmap.
The spikes were captured via their C-terminal Twin Streptactin tags at ~1000 RU levels on
two alternate flow cells of a streptavidin coated chip. 200 nM of each FDG antibody was
flowed over all four flow cells and the binding curves were double-reference subtracted (see
also Figure S11). Areas under the curve were calculated in GraphPad Prism and are listed.

absence (-) or presence (+) of D-Mannose [1M]. Blue and red symbols indicate binding in the
absence and presence of D-mannose [1M], respectively, from a representative ELISA using
BSA-based buffers (see methods). Green and purple symbols indicate binding in the

expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 extracellular domain (S1+S2 ECD), S2 domain (S2
ECD), and the receptor binding domain (RBD) were tested for binding by serial dilutions of
mAbs; all mAbs were tested at a starting antibody concentration of 100µg/ml. Commercially
available proteins were captured using mouse anti-AVI-tag mAb, so we also assessed
background binding to only anti-AVI-tag coated plates. Binding levels are shown as

Figure S11. Binding of FDG antibodies, ACE-2 and CR3022 to unmutated and N709-glycandeleted SARS-CoV-2 spike. Binding between the spikes and a FDG antibody was assessed by SPR by
capturing the unmutated spike and the N709-glycan deleted spike on flow cells 2 and 4 of a streptavidin
coated (SA) chip, and flowing over a 200 nM solution of each antibody simultaneously over all four flow
cells. Flow cells 1 and 3 were used as reference flow cells for flow cells 2 and 4, respectively. Buffer
blanks were run in a similar manner and the sensorgrams were double-referenced by first subtracting the
signal from the reference flow cell and then subtracting the reference-corrected buffer blank. CR3022
IgG and ACE-2 tagged with a mouse-Fc region were used as controls.
