ABSTRACT
Wearing face masks (alongside physical distancing) provides some protection against infection
from COVID-19. Face masks can also change how we communicate and subsequently affect
speech signal quality. Here we investigated how three face mask types (N95, surgical and cloth)
affect acoustic analysis of speech and perceived intelligibility in healthy subjects. We compared
speech produced with and without the different masks on acoustic measures of timing, frequency,
perturbation and power spectral density. Speech clarity was also examined using a standardized
intelligibility tool by blinded raters. Mask type impacted the power distribution in frequencies
above 3kHz for both the N95 and surgical masks. Measures of timing and spectral tilt also differed
across mask conditions. Cepstral and harmonics to noise ratios remained flat across mask type. No
differences were observed across conditions for word or sentence intelligibility measures. Our data
show that face masks change the speech signal, but some specific acoustic features remain largely
unaffected (e.g., measures of voice quality) irrespective of mask type. Outcomes have bearing on
how future speech studies are run when personal protective equipment is worn.

A. INTRODUCTION
Face masks (alongside physical distancing) provide some protection against infection from
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (Chu et al., 2020). Their use in public spaces and healthcare
settings is either recommended or mandatory in many jurisdictions internationally. In the United
States, the Center for Disease Control (CDC, 2020) recommends mask use to minimize droplet
dispersion and aerosolization of the virus (Bahl et al., 2020). Clinical trials and healthcare settings
continue to assess speech production, which generates respiratory droplets while unrestricted
exposure increases the likelihood of disease contraction (Stadnytskyi et al., 2020). Risk of
transmission increases through behaviors common in many speech assessment tasks including
continuous and loud speech (Asadi et al., 2019). At the same time, acknowledgement of the
necessity of personal protective equipment to minimize virus transmission has increased
internationally (Asadi et al., 2019; Stadnytskyi et al., 2020; Zaga et al., 2020). Masks, however,
alter the speech signal with downstream effects on intelligibility of a speaker. The use of personal
protective equipment poses some unique challenges for speech assessment.
We evaluated the impact wearing a mask has on acoustic output and speech perception. We
examined how different face mask types (surgical, cloth and N95), in combination with
microphone location variations (headset vs. tabletop), affect speech recordings and intelligibility.
B. METHODS
Four subjects, aged 29.0 ± 5.8 years, range 23-38; 2 males: 2 females, were included in the study.
All speakers were English speaking with no dysphonia, cognitive or neurological impairments.
One male and female had English as their second language.

1. Speech Acquisition
The speech battery was elicited by trained staff and consisted of sustaining an open vowel /aː/ for
approximately six seconds reproduced ten times and reading a phonetically balanced text, the
Grandfather Passage (Van Riper, 1963), reproduced five times. The speech battery was repeated
under four conditions in a randomized order: 1) no mask; 2) standard surgical mask (regulated
under 21 CFR 878.4040); 3) cloth mask (2-layered cotton); and 4) N95 mask (disposable mask

made from electrostatic non-woven polypropylene fiber containing a filtration layer). Subjects
were instructed to speak in a natural manner at a comfortable pitch and pace. Speech samples were
recorded using two standardized methods: 1) Using a head-mounted cardioid condenser
microphone (AKG520, Harman International, United States) positioned 2 inches from the corner
of the subject’s mouth (minimum sensitivity of -43dB, near flat frequency response) and coupled
with a QUAD-CAPTURE USB 2.0 Audio Interface (Roland Corporation, Shizuoka, Japan)
connected to a laptop computer; and 2) Using a Blue Yeti (Blue Microphones, United States)
tabletop microphone (sensitivity 4.5mV/Pa) connected to a laptop computer. The microphone was
positioned 5 ft. from the subject to simulate physical distancing measures. Standardization of the
recording environment was achieved by recording in the absence of traffic, electrical, appliance,
or other background noise. All recordings were sampled at 44.1 kHz with 32-bit quantization.

2. Speech Intelligibility Testing
Speech intelligibility was evaluated using the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthria Speech
(ASSIDS) (Yorkston and Beukelman, 1984). For each condition subjects read aloud a randomized
list of single words (one and two syllables in length) and sentences (5 to 28 syllables in length).
Two blinded raters transcribed ASSIDS words and sentences, with the percentage of correct items
calculated for each condition.

3. Audio processing and acoustic analysis
Audio files were screened for deviations and synchronized between microphones to ensure
uniformity of length. Acoustic analysis of sustained vowel and reading tasks were performed using
Praat software (Boersma, 2002). Two groups of speech features were analyzed, one to describe
responsiveness to speech and silence, and another to determine agreement between measurements
taken by different microphone conditions. The speech spectrum was used to describe the impact
of mask type on the complex voice waveform. The interaction between intensity and frequency
was characterized using the power spectral density (PSD, dB/kHz relative 2x10-5 Pa) in the longterm average spectrum on the reading task. PSD provides information on how “each frequency”

contributes to the total sound power. Frequency bands were fixed at 1kHz. PSD was averaged
across subjects for each mask condition and compared between masks not subjects.
Center-of-gravity (CoG, in Hz) was calculated from the power spectrum to inform frequency
responsiveness of the conditions. CoG is the mean power-weighted frequency, i.e. the frequency
that divides the power spectrum in equal halves above and below CoG. The intensity of
background noise (floor) was determined as equal to the average intensity during the quietest three
seconds of each files (i.e., in the absence of vocalization). Floor intensity was subtracted from the
average intensity (during vocalization) for each task (vowel and reading) to determine the speech
intensity prominence per mask condition. Features of interest included cepstral peak prominence
smoothed (CPPS), harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR), local jitter and shimmer for the sustained
vowel, and average and standard deviation of pause length for the reading task.
Fundamental frequency was calculated through autocorrelation within a restricted range (70Hz 250Hz for males, 100Hz - 300Hz for females) (Vogel et al., 2009). The analysis window was 43ms
and 30ms respectively, and window shift fixed at 10ms. The maximum number of formants was
set at 5 with a maximum of 5500Hz for formant detection. All other parameters were maintained
at default software settings. The detection of silence-speech and speech-silence transitions was
done using an energy threshold on the time domain (Rosen et al., 2010; Vogel et al., 2017). The
threshold was set to 65% of the 95th percentile, with minimum silence length set to 20ms and
minimum speech length to 30ms.

4. Statistical analysis
To examine differences of each acoustic parameter under each mask condition (no mask, surgical,
N95, and cloth), a linear mixed-effects model analysis using restricted maximum likelihood
estimation was applied. Mask type was modeled as a fixed factor, and subject and order of mask
as a random factor. Bonferroni corrected post hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted to
determine differences in mask type (surgical, N95, and cloth) compared to no mask. To investigate
power spectral density, the interaction effect between mask and frequency band was investigated.
Where the interaction was significant, planned comparisons were made for each 1Khz frequency

band to determine differences between masks types compared to no mask. SPSS was used for all
statistical analyses (IBM SPSS Version 26.0).
C. RESULTS

1. Speech intelligibility outcomes
Intelligibility varied between the speakers and across mask conditions. On average, intelligibility
remained above 92% for all mask conditions, irrespective of single words (Figure 1a) or sentence
tasks (Figure 1b). Single words (X=95.125±1.09) were perceived less accurately than words within
sentences (97.25±0.645), (t=3.3128, p=0.0161). Average percentage correct scores were used for
interpretation. Intelligibility for sentences for all conditions was between 97-98% accurate.

2. Power Spectral Density extracted from reading task under different mask conditions
Frequency bands were collapsed into 1kHz slices to explore differences in PSD between mask
type. There was a Mask × 1kHz frequency band interaction effect (F27,755=2.50, p=0.006). Post
hoc comparisons showed power (dB/Hz2) was significantly lower between 3-10 kHz for N95 mask
and 5-10kHz for surgical and cloth masks when compared to no mask on recordings made using
the head-mounted microphone (Figure 2a). No significant differences were observed between
mask conditions on recordings made using the tabletop microphone (F27,757=1.41, p=0.082; Figure
2b).

3. Acoustic parameters extracted from sustained vowel and reading tasks
For recordings produced with the head-mounted microphone, there was a significant effect of
masks for mean pause length (F3,8.97=3.88, p=0.05), percentage of pauses (F3,8.40=7.36, p=0.01)
and spectral tilt (F3,8.98=13.62, p=0.001) extracted from the reading task. Post hoc comparisons
showed that recordings produced with the N95 mask increased percentage of pauses (p=0.023)
(Table 1). Spectral tilt was lower in recordings produced with the surgical (p=0.016) and N95
masks (p=0.001). For recordings produced with the tabletop microphone, there was a significant

effect of mask type for percentage of pauses (F3,7.87=8.17, p=0.008), and spectral tilt (F3,8.39=15.43,
p=0.001) (Table 1). Post hoc comparisons revealed that the N95 and cloth masks yielded higher
percentage of pauses (N95 p=0.022; Cloth p=0.029) no mask. As with the head-mounted
microphone, recordings produced with the tabletop microphone yielded lower spectral tilt values
with both the surgical (p=0.006) and N95 masks (p=0.002). No significant differences were
observed in acoustic parameters extracted from the sustained vowel recorded using either the headmounted or tabletop microphone.
-Insert Table 1 about hereD. DISCUSSION
The type of mask affected the speech signal. We observed significant differences in acoustic power
distribution across relevant frequency bands for speech in all three mask conditions compared to
no mask. The differences were not observed in frequencies below 3kHz. Differences in signal for
higher frequencies led to altered acoustic outcomes including spectral tilt. The masks however did
not significantly influence listener-perceived intelligibility or acoustic measures of perturbation
(e.g., NHR, CPPS). Measures of speech rate were lower for N95 and surgical masks, possibly as
speakers compensate when wearing masks to improve intelligibility. It is also possible that speech
timing differences were related to how speech boundaries are identified in the analysis scripts (i.e.,
our timing analysis relied on identification of phoneme/word boundaries via intensity thresholds).
Intelligibility scores varied between raters and between mask condition. Intelligibility remained
above 92% for words and sentences. Anecdotally, it can be difficult to understand people when
they wear a mask (Goldin et al., 2020). Our small dataset suggests mask type does not
systematically impact intelligibility in controlled environments. Our recordings were made with
high-quality microphones in quiet environments. Raters listened to samples in ideal listening
conditions away from distractions and background noise but without visual aid (lips and jaw
movement) for all mask conditions. In loud environments, communication can be challenging with
multiple distractors, background noise, and a lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Noise in
ecological situations may further decrease speech intelligibility, when complementary visual cues
blocked by use of face masks play a role in communication.

It is clear that face masks change the acoustic speech signal, but some specific perceptual features
remain largely unaffected (e.g., acoustic measures of voice quality) irrespective of mask type.
These results have implications for clinical assessments and speech research where PPE is
required. It is easy to assume that subjects in a speech study will simply remove PPE during
assessments; however, subjects and researchers may be reluctant to do so if it leads to potential
exposure to airborne viruses. In longitudinal studies with data collection before, during, and after
pandemics requiring PPE, researchers should consider how to mitigate against changes to
protocols that affect speech (see Figure 3) (Redenlab, 2020).
