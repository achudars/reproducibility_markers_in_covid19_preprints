Abstract
COVID-19 caused by the emerging human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has
become a global pandemic, leading a serious threat to human health. So far, there is
none vaccines or specific antiviral drugs approved for that. Therapeutic antibodies for
SARS-CoV-2, was obtained from hyper immune equine plasma in this study. Herein,
SARS-CoV-2 RBD with gram level were obtained through Chinese hamster ovary cells
high-density fermentation. The binding of RBD to SARS-CoV-2 receptor, human
ACE2, was verified and the efficacy of RBD in vivo was tested on mice and then on
horses. As a result, RBD triggered high-titer neutralizing antibodies in vivo, and
immunoglobulin fragment F(ab’)2 was prepared from horse antisera through removing
Fc. Neutralization test demonstrated that RBD-specific F(ab’)2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2
with EC50 at 0.07 μg/ml, showing a potent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2. These
results highlights as RBD-specific F(ab’)2 as therapeutic candidate for SARS-CoV-2.

1 Introduction
In recent years, emerging or remerging viruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola, Lassa, Zika, H1N1 influenza, Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and others, challenged the global
biosafety system and attracted high attention from the world. SARS-CoV-2, firstly
identified at Wuhan, China in 20201, leading coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
have caused a global pandemic of more than 1 million confirmed cases and 70
thousands deaths (average fatality >5%). Until now, most countries in the world are in
peak outbreak and humans are suffering from the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Unfortunately, no vaccines or drugs have been approved for clinical use, in spite of
some already being in clinical trials2, 3, such as Chloroquine and Remdesivir4, 5. The
epidemic situation urgently call for effective, specific and quickly accessible drugs6.
Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) play important roles in antivirals7-9, benefiting
from that they effectively inhibit viruses at entry stage, such as preventing viral
attachment or membrane fusion. Polyclonal antibodies such as convalescent plasma
from recovered patients were usually made as emergency treatments for emerging
infectious diseases10-13. However, lack of blood source and risk of blood-borne diseases
impede the wide clinical application of convalescent plasma14. Antisera produced by
large animals like horses through passive immunization provides an alternative for
that15-17.

And the commercial process of obtaining horse antiserum and its derivatives

is mature in the modern pharmaceutical industry.
As

we

know,

SARS-CoV-2

was

reported

to

employ

angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter host cells18, using the same receptor
with SARS-CoV19. Note that the amino acid sequence identity between SARS-CoV-2
and SARS-CoV spike proteins (S) is about 76% 20. The S protein was consisted of S1
and S2, of which, S1 is responsible for receptor attachment and S2 is responsible for
membrane fusion21. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV S1 could
potently induce nAbs in vivo22, thus SARS-CoV-2 RBD theoretically can be a good
immunogen to motivate nAbs in vivo.
Based on the above, SARS-CoV-2 RBD was expressed by mammalian cells, and

its antigenicity and efficacy were tested both in mice and horses. Using traditional
systemic immunization with an immunogen dose-increasing strategy, RBD elicited
high-titer nAbs in horses. F(ab’)2 was acquired by removing Fc from IgG, and its
efficacy was evaluated through a neutralization test on live virus in vitro. F(ab’)2
reported here validates the efficacy of RBD in triggering nAbs in vivo and is highlighted
as an alternative to immunotherapy for COVID-19.

2 Results
2.1 Designation, preparation, and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 RBD
Aiming at effectively eliciting nAbs without triggering unrelated antibodies in
vivo, RBD was selected as immunogen, rather than full-length S protein, inactivated
SARS-CoV-2 whole virus or virus-like particles. The SARS-CoV-2 S gene was
obtained by de novo synthesis with codon optimization. RBD expression plasmid was
constructed as described in Fig 1A. To get large amounts of RBD proteins, the plasmid
was transfected into CHO cells followed by an 8-day high-density fermentation. RBDFc proteins secreted into medium were purified by affinity chromatography against
Protein A. Considering that Fc tag may induce unexpected antibodies in vivo, we
completely removed Fc by thrombin digestion and conducting repeated purification
against Protein A to remove residual Fc. Based on this method, gram-level RBD
proteins were obtained.
To examine the validity of RBD produced by our study, we characterized it by size,
purity, and binding capacity to SARS-CoV-2 receptor, human ACE2. In Fig 1B, single
strip was observed in the lane of RBD-Fc or RBD under the detection of reducing SDSPAGE, implying high purities of these recombinant proteins. The binding activity of
RBD to human ACE2 which was overexpressed on the surface of HeLa cells, was
determined by flow cytometry. In contrast, RBD bound to Hela cells transiently
transfected with human ACE2 plasmid, while rarely bound to HeLa cells with no ACE2
overexpression (Fig 1C). Furthermore, through cellular receptor blocking experiment,
RBD inhibited the entry of SARS-CoV-2 in a dose dependent manner (Fig 1D). These
results demonstrate a structural validity of RBD prepared in our study, guaranteeing its

availability for further research.
2.2 Antigenicity and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD in mice
RBD was first tested in mice to examine their effectiveness in triggering antibody
response in vivo. According a traditional immunization scheme described in Methods
section, mice were immunized with 25 μg each mouse via subcutaneous injections with
Freund's adjuvant. As shown in Fig 2A, mice were immunized three times in total with
two-week intervals, and sera samples were adopted ten days after each immunization
to monitor the antibody response.
In Fig 2B, the titers of specific antibodies for RBD were detected by antigencaptured ELISAs, and the titers were elevated with immunization times and reached
106 after the third immunization, reflecting that RBD effectively elicit antibodies in
mice. By neutralization test on SARS-CoV-2, sera from RBD–immunized mice after
the second immunization inhibited 50% SARS-CoV-2 at a dilution of 1:320, and sera
after the third immunization inhibited 50% SARS-CoV-2 at a dilution of over 1:2560,
showing an immunization times-dependence (Fig 2C). And, NT80s of sera from RBDimmunized mice after the second immunization and third immunization achieved over
80 and over 640, respectively. The inhibition on SARS-CoV-2 by sera from RBDimmunized mice after the third immunization was also confirmed by indirect
immunofluorescence analysis. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 on Vero-E6 cells was
sharply reduced with the decrease of sera dilutions as shown in Fig 2D, showing a
similar tendency with that in Fig 2C. These results collectively demonstrated that RBD
could be used as immunogen in triggering nAbs in vivo.
2.3 Horse immunization and antisera production
Based on the above, RBD was taken as immunogen to produce horse antisera.
Horses were immunized with RBD with complete Freund’s adjuvant at the first time
and with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant at subsequent times, via intramuscular
injections. The amount of RBD was doubled for the first three times, from 3 mg to 12
mg each horse, and fixed as 12 mg per horse when boosting before each plasma
collection (Fig 3A). Sera were adopted routinely after each immunization to monitor
the antibody response.

As a consequence, the titers of specific antibodies were increased with
immunization times and reached ~106 after the third immunization (Fig 3B). NT50s of
sera after the second and third immunization were 5120 and over 10240, and NT80s
were 640 and over 2560, putting up high neutralization on SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 3C).
Corresponding to that, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 on Vero-E6 cells was less than 20%
under the treatment of sera after the third immunization with a dilution of 1:2560, the
infection was less than 50% under the treatment with sera at a dilution of 10240 (Fig
3D). With the immunization strategy described in this study, high-titer neutralizing sera
were obtained and made available for antibody preparation.
In comparison, 11 plasma samples, randomly adopted from patients in Wuhan,
China, who recovered from COVID-19 in February 2020, were tested the same way as
horse antisera. The results were, 5 out of 11 plasma samples (45%) inhibited over 50%
SARS-CoV-2 with a dilution at 1:640, 2 out of 11 plasma samples (9%) inhibited over
80% SARS-CoV-2 with a dilution at 1:640, and 6 out of 11 plasma samples (55%)
inhibited 80% SARS-CoV-2 needed a dilution of 1:160 (Fig 3E). While horse antisera
after the third immunization inhibited 80% SARS-CoV-2 at a dilution of 1:2560 (Fig
3C). These demonstrated that passively immunized horses with RBD is more efficient
in producing nAbs than purifying antibodies from convalescent plasma after natural
infection by SARS-CoV-2, implying a necessity of producing horse antisera-derived
antibodies.
2.4 Characterization of F(ab’)2 in vitro
Through pepsin digestion and purification described in the Methods section,
F(ab’)2 was obtained from horse antisera. By a set of neutralization tests, F(ab’)2 was
found inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 as 8.78 μg/ml and EC80 as 24.92 μg/ml (Fig
4A). As shown in Fig 4B, over 90% SARS-CoV-2 were inhibited under the treatment
of F(ab’)2 at 31.15 μg/ml, and over 50% SARS-CoV-2 were inhibited at 7.81 μg/ml, the
inhibition on SARS-CoV-2 was observed with apparent dose-dependent manner.
Furthermore, the kinetics of binding to and dissociating from recombinant RBD were
determined by biomolecular interaction analysis, and the KD of total F(ab’)2 to RBD
was 75.6 nM (Fig 4C).

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.029884; this version posted April 9, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

made available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

To further improve the neutralizing activity of F(ab’)2, high binders to RBD were
purified from total F(ab’)2 by affinity chromatography against RBD. The neutralizing
activity of RBD-specific F(ab’)2 was tested the same way as total F(ab’)2. As expected,
RBD-specific F(ab’)2 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 as 0.07μg/ml and EC80 as
0.18 μg/ml, respectively (Fig 5A), showing a strong inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2.
Correspondingly, the high affinity of RBD-specific F(ab’)2 to RBD is reflected by a KD
as 0.76 nM (Fig 5B). The correlation between neutralizing activity on SARS-CoV-2
and affinity to RBD suggested that F(ab’)2 produced by our study targets RBD to work.
The potent neutralization potentiates F(ab’)2 as an alternative for SARS-CoV-2.

3 Materials and Methods
3.1 Cells lines and viruses
Vero E6 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
(DMEM, Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Gibco) at 37°C with 5% CO2. ExpiCHO-S cells were cultured with ExpiCHO
Expression Medium (Gibco) in an incubator at 37°C and 8% CO2 while shaking at 125
rpm/min.
SARS-CoV-2 live viruses were from National Virus Resource, Wuhan institute of
Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and handled in BSL-3 lab. SARS-CoV-2
viruses were passaged on Vero-E6 cells.
3.2 Protein expression and purification
The gene of SARS-CoV-2 S RBD (319-541 aa) was synthesized in GenScript Co.,
Ltd., and cloned to eukaryotic expression plasmid pCAGGS to obtain pCAGGS-Signal
peptide-RBD-(Thrombin site)-Fc. The plasmid was purified from E. coli (DH5α) with
an endotoxin-free plasmid extraction kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transfected into
ExpiCHO-S cells using ExpiFectamine Transfection Kit (Gibco). Cell supernatants
containing RBD-Fc were collected 8 days later and filtrated with 0.22 μm film before
being subjected to affinity chromatography through Protein A agarose. The eluted
fraction containing RBD-Fc was taken for further analysis. RBD without Fc tag was
obtained from RBD-Fc by removing Fc through thrombin digestion. RBD proteins were

collected from flow-through faction, affinity chromatography against Protein A were
repeatedly conduced to completely remove residual Fc.
3.3 Reducing SDS-PAGE
RBD-Fc and RBD were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie brilliant blue
staining. To verify the sizes and purities of RBD-Fc and RBD prepared in our study,
reducing SDS-PAGE were employed. Reduced samples were prepared by mixing 2 μg
proteins with loading buffer, adding 2-β-mercaptoethanol, and then boiling in water for
10 minutes. The samples were concentrated with 4% SDS-PAGE and separated with
10% SDS-PAGE. Finally, SDS-PAGE gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.
An image of the gel after decolourization was captured with a ChemiDoc MP Imaging
system (Bio-Rad).
3.4 Flow cytometry
The binding of RBD to human ACE2 was detected by flow cytometry as described
elsewhere23. HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well plate overnight. PcDNA3.1-human
ACE2 was transfected into HeLa cells with Lipo2000 (Invitrogen), PcDNA3.1 was
made as control. 24 hours later, cells were scraped off and washed with PBS. RBD was
labelled with biotin and dialyzed with PBS to remove residual biotin before use. Biotin
labelled-RBD was added to ACE2-overexpressed cells or mock cells up to a final
concentration of 10 μg/ml. After incubation at 4°C for 30 minutes, cells were washed
with PBS. Then PE Cy7-conjugated streptavidin (BD bioscience, CA, USA) were
added to cells. After incubation at 4°C for 15 minutes, cells were washed and suspended
with PBS before detecting with cytometry (BD).
3.5 Receptor blocking assay
Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry by RBD protein was carried out, as previously
described, with some modifications24. Vero-E6 cells were seeded in 48-well plates with
5 x 104 cells/well overnight. After removing culture medium, RBD diluted in 2% FBSDMEM as 20, 6.6 and 2.2 μg/ml were incubated with cells at 37°C for 1 hour, PBS was
made as control. After that, proteins were removed, cells were washed twice with PBS.
SARS-CoV-2 with MOI=0.05 in 100 μl 2% FBS-DMEM were added to each well.
After incubation at 37°C for 1 hour, supernatant was completely removed, cells were

washed twice with PBS before adding fresh 2% FBS-DMEM. 24 hours later, cell
supernatant was collected for viral copy detection. Infection (%) of SARS-CoV-2 was
calculated from control.
3.6 Mouse immunization and sampling
Female BALB/c mice aged 6-8 weeks were housed in specific pathogen-free
animal care facilities. According to a homogeneous prime-boost-boost protocol,
immunization was performed three times in total with two-week intervals. In detail, 25
μg RBD in a volume of 100 μl PBS were mixed with 100 μl Freund’s complete adjuvant
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for priming or mixed with 100 μl Freund’s incomplete
adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich) for boosting. A total of 200 μl mixture were used for
subcutaneous injections in each mouse. Blood samples were adopted from ophthalmic
vein 10 days after each immunization.
3.7 Horse immunization and sampling
Four healthy horses aged 6-10 years old after quarantine inspection were housed
in standard breeding conditions. Before immunization, 3 mg RBD protein in 3 mL PBS
were mixed with equal-volume Freund’s complete adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich) for
priming, 6 mg RBD protein in 3 mL PBS were mixed with equal-volume Freund’s
incomplete adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich) for the first boosting, and 12 mg RBD protein in
3 mL PBS was mixed with equal-volume Freund’s incomplete adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich)
for the second boosting. Horses homogeneously received intramuscular injections at
day 0, 12, and 22. Serum samples were collected from the jugular vein on days 7, 19,
and 27 for monitoring the variation of antibody response. Large amount of plasma
collection were collected after the third boosting and each collection was conducted 7
days after boosting with 12 mg RBD each horse.
3.8 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Recombinant RBD protein diluted at 2 μg/ml was coated on 96-well plate with
100 μl/well overnight at 4°C. The liquid was aspirated, and plate was washed three
times with PBS-0.1% Tween 20 then blocked with 2% nonfat-milk at 37°C for 1 hour.
Gradient diluted mouse or horse sera were added to each well and incubated at room
temperature for 1 hour. PBS and irrelevant sera were used as controls. Then, the liquid

was aspirated, and the plate was washed five times with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 and
incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with (HRP) at room temperature for 1
hour. After washing five times as usual, 3, 3’, 5, 5’-tetramethylbenzidine was added,
and the chromogenic reaction was terminated by adding H2SO4 about 10 minutes later.
Finally, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a microplate reader (TECAN,
Swiss), and values greater than twice those of the controls were considered positive.
3.9 Virus neutralization test
Vero-E6 cells were seeded in 48-well plates with 5 x 104 cells/well overnight.
Mouse or horse sera, human convalescent plasma or F(ab’)2, were firstly diluted in 100
μl 2% FBS-DMEM, and incubated with 5 μl SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=0.05) at 37 °C for 1
hour. Then cell supernatants were aspirated, 100 μl antisera- or antibody-virus mixture
were added. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 hour, the supernatant were completely
removed, cells were washed with PBS and supplemented with fresh 10% FBS-DMEM.
After 24 hours, cell supernatants were collected and subjected to viral RNA isolation
and cells were kept for indirect immunofluorescence analysis. Viral genome copies
were detected by qRT-PCR with primers targeting S gene.
3.10 Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA)
Cell plates were collected after a virus neutralization test. Cells were washed with
PBS then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with Triton x-100. After
that, cells were blocked with 2% nonfat-milk at room temperature for 1 hour, then were
washed with PBS and incubated with rabbit anti-NP antibodies at room temperature for
2 hours. Cells were washed again before incubation with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor
488-conjugated antibodies at room temperature for 1 hour. Finally, cells were washed
and stained with 4, 6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 10 minutes at room
temperature. Images were captured by a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan).
3.11 Preparation of F(ab’)2
When neutralizing titer of horse antisera met requirement as NT50 over 10000, the
plasma were collected with the use of a plasma collection machine 7 days after each
boosting. Briefly, plasma was firstly diluted with bi-distilled water at a ratio of 1:4 and
the pH was adjusted to 3.0 with HCl. Then pepsin (Sigma) was added and the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.029884; this version posted April 9, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

temperature was adjusted to 30°C. The incubation was preserved for 1.5 hour with
stirring. Pepsin was inactivated by temperature evaluation, then ammonium sulfate with
gradient concentration was added in proper order, each followed by filtration. Finally,
the supernatant was subjected to a Protein A column to remove residual IgG, and F(ab’)2
were collected from flow-through fraction.
3.12 Biomolecular interaction analysis (BIA)
The affinities of F(ab’)2 to RBD were monitored by biolayer interferometry (BLI)
using an Octet-Red 96 device (Pall ForteBio LLC., CA) according to previously
described protocols 25. Briefly, RBD was biotinylated at room temperature for 0.5 hours
by incubating with biotin at a molar ratio of 1:3. Residual biotin was removed by
dialysis with PBS. Biotinylated RBD at 10 μg/ml was loaded onto streptavidin
biosensors (ForteBio) until saturation, and F(ab’)2 or RBD-specific F(ab’)2 diluted to
4000, 2000, 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5 nM or 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.3, 15.6 nM
were then loaded. The kinetics of association (Kon) and dissociation (Kdis) were
measured, the data was processed by an Octet data analysis system.
3.13 Purification of RBD-Specific F(ab’)2
For purification of RBD-specific F(ab’)2, RBD protein expressed by CHO cells
and prepared as described above, was coupled on pre-activated resin (PabPurSulfolink
Beads, SMART Life Sciences, Changzhou) through amino reaction17. And the RBDcoupled resin was then used to purify RBD-specific F(ab’)2 from total F(ab’)2. In brief,
total F(ab’)2 were diluted in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and repeatedly flowed
through RBD-coupled resin to make binding to RBD. Then resin was adequately
washed with 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) before adding Glycine (1 M) to elute
high binders. The eluted component, RBD-specific F(ab’)2, was dialyzed with PBS to
remove glycine and maintained in PBS before use.

All animal experiments were performed strictly according to the Regulations for
the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals in China, and the
protocols were approved by the Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee of Wuhan
Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Wuhan, China).

4 Discussion
COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease caused by a new member of the
coronavirus family. SARS-CoV-2 became a serious threat to global public health within
a short time period during the outbreak. Although biotechnology and pharmaceutical
technology has grown rapidly in the 21st century, humans remain passive in responding
to public health emergencies. Due to the close contact with wild animals such as
pangolin and bats23-25, infectious diseases caused by coronaviruses such as SARS- and
MERS-CoV along with SARS-CoV-2 uninterruptedly pose threats to mankind. This is
a reminder of developing broad-spectrum drugs and vaccines26, when the pace of
specific drug development is not fast enough to cope with. Prior experience in
infectious disease control suggests that antiviral serum obtained from hyper immune
equine plasma has long been used for the treatment of life threatening viral diseases27.
We showed that horse immunoglobulin fragment F(ab’)2 has a potential to provide
protection for COVID-19.
Clinical evidence showed that the latent period of COVID-19 is short (about 5
days to 2 weeks) and that most patients appear to recover within a short time with no
persistent or latent infection in the organism, it is reasonable to conclude that a
neutralizing antibody may play an important role in preventing SARS-CoV-2
infection28. Shen et al. recently reported that administration of convalescent plasma
containing neutralizing antibody could improve COVID-19 patient clinical status13.
Convalescent plasma from patients has played important roles in the treatment of
infectious diseases29. The convalescent plasma was used for severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS)30,

31

, H5N1 influenza infection32,

33

, Ebola34, and other viral

infections, while it has the risk of blood-borne disease and usually suffers from
insufficient blood sources.
Seventeen years ago, we prepared inactivated SARS-CoV whole viruses and the test

in mice proved that the inactivated vaccine induced specific antibodies to SARS-CoV,
and a neutralization test in vitro also proved that the induced antibodies could neutralize
SARS-CoV35. A major problem meriting further study in the induction of neutralizing
antibodies by an inactivated SARS-CoV whole virus is that some neutralizing
antibodies may enhance the infection of the coronavirus36. Several studies showed
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS coronavirus infection37,

38

.

Additionally, reports of antibodies induced by the enhanced infection are found in
studies of HIV, SIV and Dengue virus39-41. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
receptor binding domain (RBD) was selected as immunogen in this study. It could
induce highly effective neutralizing antibodies with higher safety.
In addition, RBD-specific horse F(ab’)2, as a relatively specific antibodies, has its
unique advantages in contrast to monoclonal antibodies and human immunoglobulin
after natural infection. It specifically targeted RBD, prevented the binding of virus to
its receptor, ACE2, bringing no risk associated with Fc, further avoiding ADE.
Meanwhile, it binds multiple epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, hinting a broad-spectrum
neutralization on human or bat SARS-related coronaviruses and bat SARS-like
coronaviruses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that neutralizing titer of horse antisera
by immunization with RBD is higher than that of convalescent human plasma after
natural infection by SARS-CoV-2 in this study. Moreover, the horses could be
immunized more times. Higher titer of therapeutic antibodies for SARS-CoV-2
obtained from hyper immune equine plasma was expected.
In this study, large amounts of horse antisera were prepared by immunization with
SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Before making RBD as immunogen, we verified its conformation
by receptor binding experiments and tested its antigenicity in mice. According a
strategy of immunogen dose-increasing strategy, high-titer horse antisera were obtained,
and F(ab’)2 were manufactured in a GMP workshop to be processed for clinical study.
As a matter of fact, monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV, like CR3022 potently
binds SARS-CoV-2 while its neutralization on SARS-CoV-2 has not been verified42.
Other neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV were proved weakly binding SARSCoV-2 RBD43. F(ab’)2 prepared by our study can potentially neutralize SARS-CoV to

some extent, since it contains antibodies binding multiple epitopes on RBD, in addition
to that amino acid sequence identity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs is
73% and these two employed the same receptor ACE2 to enter host cells.
Besides, F(ab’)2 is a kind of immunoglobulin fragment, which is prepared by
removing Fc from IgG and retaining the active fragment, significantly reducing side
effects in the body. Although horse F(ab’)2 is a heterologous protein to human immune
system, horse serum proteins and Fc-related proteins are removed as much as possible
using modern industrial techniques. Also, single-dose administration will avoid the
adverse effects and efficacy falling induced by repeated administration. Additionally,
the operation of Fc removal eliminates the major concern about ADE in coronaviruses.
These enable antibody drugs such as horse F(ab’)2 to be candidates for COVID-19
therapy.

5 Conclusions
In summary, we herein successfully obtained therapeutic antibodies from hyper
immune equine plasma. Horse immunoglobulin fragment F(ab’)2 against RBD was
highlighted as a potential therapeutic for COVID-19.

Figure 1 Preparation and characterization of RBD-Fc and RBD. A SARSCoV-2 S protein contains a signal peptide, a receptor binding subunit S1, and a fusion
subunit S2. The receptor binding domain (RBD) was predicted as 319-541 aa of S
protein. Construction of RBD expression plasmid: RBD was constructed after an
efficient signal peptide and followed by the thrombin site and linked with Fc as
purification tag. RBD was obtained by CHO expression and purified from cell culture
supernatant through affinity chromatography against Protein A, followed by thrombin
digestion. B RBD-Fc and RBD were detected by reducing SDS-PAGE with Coomassie
bright blue staining. Their sizes and purities are shown. C The binding of RBD to
human ACE2 were detected by flow cytometry. HeLa cells were transfected with
human ACE2 plasmid for 24 hours. Biotin-labelled RBD were incubated with the cells
and followed by staining with fluorescent antibodies. The binding of RBD to ACE2HeLa cells were observed as additional peaks compared to the HeLa cells. D Vero-E6
cells were pretreated with RBD at concentrations as shown in figure, then infected by
SARS-CoV-2 at MOI=0.05. The blockade by proteins were calculated from the mock.
