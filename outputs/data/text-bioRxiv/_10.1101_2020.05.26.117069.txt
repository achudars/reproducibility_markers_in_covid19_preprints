ABSTRACT

2

The set of mutations observed at the outset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may illuminate how

3

the virus will adapt to humans as it continues to spread. Viruses are expected to quickly acquire

4

beneficial mutations upon jumping to a new host species. Advantageous nucleotide

5

substitutions can be identified by their parallel occurrence in multiple independent lineages and

6

are likely to result in changes to protein sequences. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is acquiring

7

mutations more slowly than expected for neutral evolution, suggesting purifying selection is the

8

dominant mode of evolution during the initial phase of the pandemic. However, several parallel

9

mutations arose in multiple independent lineages and may provide a fitness advantage over the

10

ancestral genome. We propose plausible reasons for several of the most frequent mutations.

11

The absence of mutations in other genome regions suggests essential components of SARS-

12

CoV-2 that could be the target of drug development. Overall this study provides genomic

13

insights into how SARS-CoV-2 has adapted and will continue to adapt to humans.

SUMMARY

16

In this study we sought signals of evolution to identify how the SARS-CoV-2 genome has

17

adapted at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that the genome is largely

18

undergoing purifying selection that maintains its ancestral sequence. However, we identified

19

multiple positions on the genome that appear to confer an adaptive advantage based on their

20

repeated evolution in independent lineages. This information indicates how SARS-CoV-2 will

21

evolve as it diversifies in an increasing number of hosts.

INTRODUCTION
A better understanding of the origin and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may

24

help to mitigate disease outbreaks. Initial genome comparisons point toward a proximal origin

25

in horseshoe bats (1), with possible intermediate hosts including pangolins, cats, and ferrets (2-

26

4). Differences between host species are believed to present many barriers to host switching,

27

likely resulting in a virus that is initially maladapted to a new host (5, 6). Viruses are expected to

28

quickly adapt to a new species via mutations that increase transmissibility and decrease the

29

serial interval (7). Yet, relatively little is known about the mode and tempo of evolution at the

30

start of many epidemics, including the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Owing to the relatively high

31

mutation rates of RNA viruses, comparison of genome sequences may reveal a wealth of

32

information even at early stages of an outbreak (8).

33

Previous studies suggest that new environments provide the opportunity to develop a

34

large number of beneficial mutations, which may accrue quickly due to natural selection (9).

35

High rates of adaptation have been observed for viruses propagated in cell lines belonging to

36

new host species (10). The possibility of an adaptive advantage over the ancestor gives rise to

37

three outcomes: (i) increasing frequencies of beneficial mutations, (ii) parallel evolution, where

38

the same mutation rises to detectable frequencies in different lineages, and (iii) positive

39

selection, where the number of non-synonymous changes exceeds the number of synonymous

40

changes in protein coding regions of the genome. Mutations can rise in frequency for reasons

41

other than positive selection, such as arising by chance near the outset of a pandemic or after

42

undergoing a bottleneck when invading a new population of susceptible hosts. It is also

43

challenging to accurately determine mutant frequencies due to an uneven sampling of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.26.117069; this version posted May 26, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

44

genomes. Therefore, repeated parallel evolution is a clearer signal of adaptation than changes

45

in frequency. Evidence of parallel evolution also enables identification of beneficial mutations

46

before they have had time to substantially rise in frequency, which is particularly useful at the

47

beginning of a pandemic.

48

At the other end of the spectrum is the mode and tempo of evolution that is expected

49

when an organism is well-poised to enter a new environment or has spent a long time adapting

50

to a specific context. In such cases we anticipate evolution to occur slowly because further

51

mutation would not provide an advantage over recent ancestors. This would appear in the

52

genome as neutral or purifying selection, where the number of non-synonymous changes does

53

not exceed the number of synonymous changes at protein coding sites. Invasion into an

54

environment where an organism was already well-suited would cause a bottleneck event that

55

results in a homogenous population and a low rate of divergence due to purifying, or negative

56

selection. Therefore, the frequency and type of mutations at the outset of a pandemic can

57

provide insight into the ways in which a pathogen is initially well-adapted or maladapted,

58

potentially informing the development of therapies that target its weaknesses and avoid

59

resistance evolution.

60

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

61

SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing purifying selection

62

Based on previous studies from similar coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is anticipated to have

63

a relatively low per-base pair mutation rate for RNA viruses, resulting in approximately 1

64

mutation per genome replication (11-13). We estimated an average viral replication time of 6

65

hours based on SARS-CoV-2 titers and the known replication times of similar viruses (14).

66

Therefore, we would expect mutations to accumulate on the order of ~4 per day under neutral

67

evolution and potentially faster under positive selection. In contrast, we observe the number of

68

nucleotide substitutions increasing at a rate of approximately 0.062 per day (Fig. 1). This

69

equates to 8 Ã— 10-4 per site per year, which is similar in magnitude to other RNA viruses and

70

indistinguishable from that of SARS-CoV (15). This result implies that purifying selection

71

dominated during the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, it does not rule out

72

the possibility that some sites are under positive selection even if most remain under negative

73

selection.

74

Mutational and selection biases across the SARS-CoV-2 genome

75

Beneficial mutations can be readily identified in laboratory evolution experiments

76

through parallel mutations that arise in multiple independent replicates (16, 17), also known as

77

homoplasies. We applied this intuition to search for beneficial mutations in the SARS-CoV-2

78

genome as it diversifies across many hosts. As shown in Figure 2, we observed 6,028 positions

79

with substitutions out 29,903 nucleotides in the genome (Fig. 2a). Of these, 2,070 positions had

80

more than one independent substitution, 1,858 of which were located in coding regions.

81

Substitutions displayed a strong bias toward guanine (G) and cytosine (C) being replaced with

82

uracil (U) in the genome (Fig. S1). U replacing C was 2.5-fold more common than the reverse,

83

and U replacing G was 6.4-fold more common than the reverse. C to U transitions accounted for

84

31% of substitutions, and may result from effects of the APOBEC3G gene causing deamination

85

of C to U (18). G to U substitutions represented 43% of transversions, although the cause of

86

their relatively high frequency was unknown.

87

Non-synonymous substitutions represented 66% of substitutions in coding regions.

88

Based on the frequency of codons and observed substitution rates, we estimated that non-

89

synonymous substitutions would represent 71% of substitutions without selection against

90

changes to the protein sequence. Therefore, the slight bias toward non-synonymous

91

substitutions is lower than expected and consistent with purifying selection being the dominant

92

mode of evolution. However, the skew toward non-synonymous substitutions varied across the

93

genome (Fig. 2a), reaching a peak within the gene coding for the nucleocapsid protein N that

94

protects the viral RNA. In contrast, genes with a bias toward synonymous substitutions, such as

95

the membrane protein M, indicate their protein sequence is relatively constrained.

96

We observed several conserved regions that displayed a relative lack of mutations (Fig.

97

2a), including the C-terminus of nsp3 (1,880 â€“ 1,959), the N-terminus of nsp10 (2 â€“ 59), a

98

central region within the RNA polymerase nsp12 (504 â€“ 570), and a region within the spike

99

protein S (976 â€“ 1,041). The conserved region within nsp12 overlaps with the entry tunnel for

100

the RNA template (19) and the predicted binding sites of many antivirals (20, 21). The

101

conserved region within S encompasses the central helix (22), which is believed to initiate the

102

fusion of viral and host membranes (23). These conserved regions may offer reasonable drug

103

targets because they are more likely to avoid the evolution of drug resistance.

104

Evidence of adaptation at multiple genome positions

105

The observation of parallel evolution in independent lineages enables us to pinpoint

106

specific genome positions that likely increase the fitness of SARS-CoV-2 in the human host. The

107

extreme 5' and 3' ends of the genome contained the highest concentration of parallel

108

substitutions (Fig. 2a). Despite their high frequencies, these substitutions were observed

109

exclusively in genomes originating from the same laboratory, which suggests they are

110

sequencing errors rather than authentic mutations. Therefore, we chose to focus on

111

substitutions found in genomes from at least four of the 529 contributing laboratories to

112

mitigate the presence of lab-specific sequencing errors.

113

We observed two substitutions with more than 30 cases of parallelism across SARS-CoV-

114

2 genomes (Fig. 2b). The most frequent substitution occurred 50 different times at position

115

11,083, which results in a non-synonymous change (L37F) in nsp6, a transmembrane protein

116

localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and implicated in formation of autophagosomes (24-27).

117

The substitution at 11,083 occurred nearby another frequent substitution at position 11,074

118

that is synonymous. Both substitutions were conversions to uracil at sites adjacent to eight

119

consecutive uracils in the genome (Fig. 3), suggesting they may occur more frequently due to an

120

increased mutation rate at homopolymeric sites (28). A similar conversion to uracil at position

121

21,575 is located in the middle of 7 other uracils and results in a non-synonymous change (L5F)

122

to the protein sequence of S (Fig. 3). Three other substitutions were adjacent to at least 3

123

uracils in the genome: positions 9,474, 26,681, and 28,253. The high frequency of substitutions

124

next to poly(U) tracts is likely due to increased mutation rates at these positions, although we

125

cannot rule out that they may also have adaptive significance.

126

The next most frequent substitution occurred 16 times at position 16,887 and results in

127

a synonymous change to nsp3. There is presently no evidence that this mutation is involved in

128

RNA base pairing, and it is located in a region of the genome with relatively little conserved RNA

129

secondary structure (29). The most frequent non-C-to-U substitution was A10323G, which

130

results in a non-synonymous change (K90R) to the protease nsp5. This amino acid replacement

131

is distally located from the active site and the nsp5 dimer interface (30), suggesting it may not

132

be of adaptive significance. We observed a similar substitution, A21137G, which results in a

133

non-synonymous change (K160R) to nsp16. However, this residue is distant from the active site

134

and from the nsp16/nsp10 interface (31), suggesting its replacement could be of little

135

consequence.

136

Two different nonsynonymous mutations in the N gene, encoding the nucleocapsid

137

protein, repeatedly evolved in a disordered linker domain between structural capsid elements

138

(32). These mutations, R185C and T205I, alter a region acting as an RNA chaperone that

139

facilitates template switching and RNA synthesis during replication (33, 34). Similarly intriguing,

140

we observed divergent nucleotide substitutions, G28077C/U, that both result in the same non-

141

synonymous change (V62L) to ORF8. This region of ORF8 is missing in some SARS-related

142

viruses (Fig. 3), and underwent repeated deletions during the SARS-CoV epidemic (35). ORF8 is

143

known to rapidly evolve and the necessity of its role in the human host remains contentious

144

(36).

145

We sought to determine whether any of these eighteen highly parallel mutations (Fig.

146

2b) could be attributable to common sequencing errors. We reasoned that sequencing errors

147

would be randomly distributed across the phylogenetic tree, whereas adaptive mutations are

148

likely to expand in size along a specific lineage. Therefore, we calculated the probability of

149

finding a mutant clade of size R or larger by chance given each substitution's observed

150

frequency. For example, the substitution G11074U had a largest clade size of R=4, for which we

151

observed 24 mutants among 12,435 genomes. In this case, the probability of observing four or

152

more adjacent mutants on the phylogenetic tree is much less than 10-6. Extremely small p-

153

values were found for all parallel substitutions reported here, except the mutation at 9,474

154

which was only supported by singletons (R=1).

155

In this study, we determined that SARS-CoV-2 is evolving predominantly under purifying

156

selection that purges most mutations since they are deleterious. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2

157

was well-poised to invade the human population, although it continues to adapt to humans

158

through specific mutations that may accumulate in individual genomes as SARS-CoV-2

159

continues to evolve. The few highly parallel substitutions that we observed offer intriguing

160

avenues for further investigation, as most are cryptic and located in poorly characterized

161

regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Notably, some genes acquired relatively few mutations,

162

which implies strict sequence constraints that may focus drug development strategies against

163

these gene products. The paucity of mutations overall suggests that coronaviruses are well-

164

suited to jumping between hosts and caution should be taken to avoid direct or indirect contact

165

with their animal reservoirs. This is further corroborated by the relatively small number of

166

genome positions that have undergone multiple parallel substitutions despite a plentiful supply

167

of mutations.

168

METHODS

169

Genome collection and comparison

170

Complete (> 29,000 nucleotide) SARS-CoV-2 genomes were downloaded from GISAID

171

(37) on May 2nd, 2020. Genomes with more than 500 degeneracies (e.g., N's) were removed,

172

resulting in a collection of 12,435 genomes, of which 12,285 had a known date of collection

173

that we used as a proxy for the duration of growth relative to the first genome (2019-12-24).

174

Genomes were aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512.2) using the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.26.117069; this version posted May 26, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

175

DECIPHER (v2.16.1) (38, 39) package for the R (v3.6.1) programming language (40). Genomic

176

distance was defined as the number of positions differing from the reference genome without

177

considering insertions or deletions, which were very infrequent.

178

To create Figure 4, viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 were selected from a recent

179

study (1) and supplemented with one sequence derived from a pangolin host in another study

180

(2). Genomes were aligned and a maximum likelihood tree was created using DECIPHER with

181

the best fitting evolutionary model.

182

Identification of parallel substitutions across independent lineages

183

Starting from the set of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we constructed a multiple sequence

184

alignment, matrix of pairwise nucleotide identity, and rooted neighbor joining tree using

185

DECIPHER. Sequences were compared at each site in the reference sequence to identify

186

independent substitutions on the phylogenetic tree. That is, we mapped mutations onto tips of

187

the phylogenetic tree and propagated them back till they coalesced at a common ancestor

188

(edge). This enabled us to count the number of independent substitutions that were inherited

189

by one or more strains. To increase robustness to the tree topology, we ignored single

190

reversions to the ancestral character that occurred within a clade sharing a derived character.

191

This process resulted in an integer representing the number of parallel substitutions

192

occurring at each position in the reference sequence. We determined that eight or more

193

independent substitutions was statistically significant for C to U transitions (p < 0.001, Poisson

194

distribution and Bonferroni correction) given the observed mutations rates and assuming

195

mutations are randomly distributed along the genome. All other substitutions (e.g., G to U)

196

required fewer cases of parallelism to achieve the same degree of statistical significance.

197

Conserved regions were defined as stretches (â‰¥ 100 nucleotides) of the genome where

198

the average number of independent substitutions fell below 0.2 (Fig. 2a). To improve the

199

identification of conserved regions, we applied a center-point moving average function that

200

smoothed the mutation signal across the genome. A similar process was used to determine the

201

bias in synonymous versus non-synonymous substitutions within protein coding regions (Fig.

202

2a). A fully reproducible and open source analysis pipeline is provided on GitHub

FIGURES AND FIGURE LEGENDS

Figure 1. Rate of acquiring substitutions by SARS-CoV-2. The number of genomes with a given
number of nucleotide substitutions relative to the reference genome (NC_045512.2) are shown
since the first collected genome. The number of substitutions has increased at an average rate
of approximately 0.062 substitutions per day (line of best fit), which is substantially lower than
expected from a neutral model of evolution (~1 per day) and indicative of purifying selection.

Figure 2. Mutational biases in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. (A) Independent substitutions were
unevenly distributed along the genome, with a high concentration of parallel mutations near
the genome termini and a paucity of substitutions in some coding regions. Long (â‰¥ 100
nucleotide) conserved regions with few substitutions indicate where the genome is more
constrained and could be the focus of drug targets that avoid resistance development. Some
proteins (e.g., M) displayed a bias toward synonymous substitutions, suggesting the dominance
of purifying selection purging changes to the protein sequence. (B) The pattern of parallel
substitutions with 10 or more independent occurrences (number in parentheses) across a
rooted phylogenetic tree built from SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Of these 18 substitutions, 14 change
the protein sequence (N) and four are synonymous (S). The size of the largest clade associated
with each mutation is shown in braces. (C) The matrix of substitutions shows a bias toward
cytosine or guanine to uracil mutations.

Figure 3. Comparative genomics of parallel substitutions in protein coding regions. A midpoint
rooted maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree constructed from SARS-related coronavirus
genome sequences with accession numbers colored by host species (human, bat, masked palm
civet, or pangolin). Codons are colored by their corresponding amino acid with frequent
nucleotide substitutions shown relative to the reference SARS-CoV-2 sequence (top). Poly(U)
sequences are found surrounding the substitutions at positions 11,074, 11,083, and 21,575. The
two substitutions observed at position 28,077 result in conversions to the same amino acid in
ORF8.
