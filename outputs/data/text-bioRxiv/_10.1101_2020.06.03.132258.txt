Abstract
Respiratory infections, such as the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) and
other lung injuries, damage the pulmonary epithelium. In the most severe cases this leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Due
to respiratory failure associated with ARDS, the clinical intervention is the
use of mechanical ventilation. Despite the benefits of mechanical ventilators, prolonged or misuse of these ventilators may lead to ventilationassociated/ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI). Damage caused to epithelial cells within the alveoli can lead to various types of complications and increased mortality rates. A key component of the immune response is recruitment of macrophages, immune cells that differentiate into phenotypes with
unique pro- and/or anti-inflammatory roles based on the surrounding environment. An imbalance in pro- and anti-inflammatory responses can have
deleterious effects on the individual’s health. To gain a greater understanding
of the mechanisms of the immune response to VILI and post-ventilation outcomes, we develop a mathematical model of interactions between the immune
system and site of damage while accounting for macrophage polarization.
Through Latin hypercube sampling we generate a virtual cohort of patients
with biologically feasible dynamics. We use a variety of methods to analyze
the results, including a random forest decision tree algorithm and parameter
sensitivity with eFAST. Analysis shows that parameters and properties of
transients related to epithelial repair and M1 activation and de-activation

1. Introduction
Inflammation occurs in the lungs when an immune response is initiated
to eliminate an insult. Types of insults include inhaled pathogens, such
pneumonia, tuberculosis, SARS-COV-2, or other harmful particles. In the
most severe cases this leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Due to respiratory failure associated with ARDS, the clinical intervention
is the use of mechanical ventilation. When individuals have a severe form
of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-COV-2, the disease can lead to
respiratory failure and death of the patients. In a recent study, two-thirds of
patients admitted for COVID-19 required mechanical ventilation [1].
Despite the benefits of mechanical ventilators, prolonged or misuse of
these ventilators may lead to ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI). In this
work we will focus on the tissue damage associated with mechanical ventilation and resulting immune cell recruitment. The damage caused to alveolar sacs (clusters of alveolar cells) during mechanical ventilation can lead
to volutrauma (extreme stress/strain), barotrauma (air leaks), atelectrauma
(repeated opening and closing of alveoli), and biotrauma (general severe inflammatory response). If the trauma increases, it can lead to multi-system
organ failure [2, 3].
It has also been shown that the inflammatory response of the elderly is
altered in the lungs and other areas [4, 5]. As compared to younger individuals, increased levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines and different
immune cell function have been reported in older patients [6]. A 2003-2008
study conducted at Bridgeport Hospital reported that 4,238 out of 9,912
(42.8%) patients received mechanical ventilation for a median of two days.
Mortality or discharge to extended-care facilities increased for each decade of
age greater than 65 years [7]. Additionally, the case fatality rate for COVID19 patients over 70 years old and over 80 years old was around 50.8% and
14.8% of the total number of deaths, respectively [8]. This is in agreement
with other studies reporting higher rates of severe outcomes in patients with

COVID-19 aged 65 or older [9]. The change in the inflammatory response
with patient age combined with the increased need for ventilation and increased mortality rate among the elderly stresses the need to investigate the
influence of aging in VILI. The framework we have built here addresses VILI
with various parameters and initial conditions that can be narrowed in future
studies with data from different age groups and/or insults to explore dynamics and driving factors in various diseases related to age and/or outcome.
We used mathematical modeling to investigate the role of the pulmonary
immune response and treatments in ventilator-induced damage. We adapted
a model developed by Torres et al. for the innate immune response to bacteria, which accounts for macrophage polarization, by including epithelial
dynamics and stretch-induced recruitment of immune cells [10]. We use this
model to understand the mechanisms by which the immune system responds
to damaged epithelial cells and the sensitivity of post-ventilation outcome
to components of this complex process. We begin this study by analyzing
the epithelial subsystem mathematically. This allows us to understand fixed
point stability and how various parameters affect stability for the new portion
of the model. The full model is a large system of ordinary differential equations with a large number of parameters and a variety of nonlinear dynamics.
Allowing the parameters in the model to vary over biologically feasible ranges
using Latin hypercube sampling simulates the variety of immune system dynamics that may be observed in patients. We organize disease progressions
into three categories, healthy, moderate inflammation, and severe inflammation, based on the percentage of healthy epithelial cells. To determine what
is driving differences in outcome, we use a variety of methods to analyze the
resulting dynamics: 1) comparison of parameters associated with different
outcomes, 2) random forest decision tree algorithm, which parses through
the variety of predictors that may be particularly important in the immune
response to VILI and 3) parameter sensitivity with eFAST, a variance-based
method.
1.1. Biological background
The alveolar epithelium consists of alveolar type I and type II cells. Alveolar type I cells make up about 95% of the alveolar surface and are primarily
responsible for facilitating gas exchange. Type II cells cover the other 5%
of the surface and are important in the innate immune response. In the
presence of damage, these cells proliferate to repair the epithelium and can
also differentiate to type I cells [11, 12]. The extent to which the alveolar

epithelium is damaged is a useful indicator of the overall effects of a lung
insult [13].
The immune response is divided into innate (non-specific) and adaptive
(acquired) responses. Two of the most important innate immune cells are
neutrophils and macrophages, which can be tissue-specific or recruited to
the site upon damage. The innate response is always present and ready to
defend against pathogens or other insults. On the other hand, the adaptive
immune response includes B and T cells, which differentiate in such a way
that they are effective at fighting specific pathogens. They are recruited by
antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, that are a
part of the innate immune response.
In this work, we concentrate on the innate immune system when modeling VILI to gain a better understanding of the epithelial and immune cell
interactions. Lung infection may lead to the need for mechanical ventilation
and the resulting model could be adapted in the future to study mechanical
ventilation with infection. Initially we consider a system in which the immune response is triggered by damage associated with the ventilator without
infection.
One of the key components of this response is recruitment of macrophages
from the bone marrow and bloodstream to the damaged area to support
the population of resident alveolar macrophages. Macrophages send signals
to other immune cells and aid in the process of eliminating dead cells and
repairing damaged ones [14]. Phenotypes of macrophages can range from
“pro-inflammatory” (M1) or “anti-inflammatory” (M2) based on their activators and byproducts [15, 16]. Their pro-inflammatory behavior includes
destroying pathogens, consuming damaged cells, and amplification of signaling. Their anti-inflammatory response, which counteracts pro-inflammatory
behavior, promotes repair by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines and removing apoptotic neutrophils. A single macrophage may produce both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals concurrently, which can make
classification and identification of phenotype a difficult question.
Another important type of immune cell is the neutrophil, which responds
quickly to pro-inflammatory signals sent from damaged epithelial cells and
other resident cells. A small amount of neutrophils are found in the lungs
in homeostasis. Additional neutrophils are recruited from bone marrow in
response to pro-inflammatory signals from damaged epithelial cells and resident macrophages during an insult in large numbers [17]. Neutrophils have
phagocytic capabilities in the presence of invading pathogens, but in the

case of VILI without infection neutrophils recruit other immune cells such
as macrophages through the production of pro-inflammatory agents such as
proteinases and cytokines and contribute to the removal of damaged or dead
tissue. An overabundance of neutrophils and their byproducts can cause further unnecessary damage [18]. Neutrophils are relatively short-lived; they
become apoptotic and are removed by macrophages [17] or become necrotic
in an uncontrolled death resulting in the release of cytotoxic material [19].
An imbalance in the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses can cause complications for the individual. Furthermore, an absence of immune cells can
lead to immunodeficiency and a surplus of immune cells can result in chronic
inflammation [17]. Thus, it is important to understand the immune response
to lung injury and the interplay between various types of cells. It is also
believed that macrophages play a significant role in the impact of aging on
the immune response [6, 20, 21].
1.2. Mathematical background
Mathematical modeling is used to capture the complexities of the immune response to epithelial cell damage, including important feedback loops
and nonlinearities. Analyzing the resulting model gives insight into the driving mechanisms of this system. An in silico approach allows us to simulate
various scenarios or new treatments, especially when in vivo and in vitro
experiments to explore possible interventions to improve outcomes for patients are difficult to perform. To our knowledge, no mathematical models
have described M1/M2 interactions specific to the immune response to VILI.
Many models have examine the immune response to bacterial and viral infections, such as pneumonia [22–24], tuberculosis [25–27], and influenza [28–30].
Additionally, models related to smoking and asthma [31–34], mechanical ventilation [35–42], and general inflammatory stress [4, 43] have been developed,
but these models generally deal with the mechanics of the airways, including airflow, pressure, and gas exchange, and how these mechanics respond
to inflammation and particle inhalation without accounting for the various
cells types involved in the immune response. Models have also been developed to understand and analyze the molecular mechanisms that govern the
phenotype switch that macrophages undergo from pro-inflammatory to antiinflammatory, as well as other important subcellular pathways [29, 44, 45].
Common modeling approaches used in these papers include agent-based
models [27, 31, 34], partial differential equations [42, 43], ordinary differential
equations [22–25, 30, 32], and Boolean models [29]. Each technique has its

advantages and disadvantages, but we choose to model the inflammatory response to VILI, specifically the resulting damage to epithelial cells, using a set
of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which we describe further
in the following section. Systems of ODEs are ideal for modeling dynamical systems because of their ability to capture, with reasonable computation
times, the highly nonlinear behavior of the many immune cells, epithelial
cells and other mediators involved in the immune response to VILI. This
allows for mathematical and sampling approaches to be used to determine
key components of the the biological process being modeled.

2.1. Epithelial subsystem
The primary focus of this model is to examine the effects of damage on
the alveolar epithelium, in particular alveolar type II cells, since they are
responsible for restoration of the epithelium. In this section we begin with a
simple model, concentrating on the novel aspect of incorporating epithelial
cells and relative damage due to inflammation. We then add variables to
more accurately model the dynamics within this system.
We begin with a small three-dimensional system of differential equations,
shown in Eqs (1)-(3), where Eh is the proportion of the local space filled by
healthy cells, Ed is the proportion of the local space filled by damaged cells,
and Ee represents dead cells or empty “space” that can be replaced/filled
with healthy cells. Each term represents a biological event explained by
the brackets above the term. This first model includes only the baseline
abilities of epithelial cells to proliferate and repair themselves in the presence of sustained damage. We do not explicitly model proliferating and
non-proliferating cells; the parameter p is modulated to reflect the general
mechanism by which neighboring epithelial cells renew surrounding “space”
(tracked by Ee ).

Damage from stretch due to mechanical ventilation is represented by the
rate s, and causes healthy epithelial cells to become damaged. This general
term covers over-distension for any mode of ventilation. Some damaged cells,
depending on the severity of damage, have the ability to repair themselves,
returning from the Ed state back to Eh , represented by a baseline repair rate
r [46]. Damaged cells may also decay naturally at a rate b.
The first terms in Eq (1) for Eh , and Eq (3) for Ee , account for proliferation of the healthy and damaged cells into empty space. Note that
total local space is conserved: Ee + Eh + Ed = 1. Therefore, we can define
Ee = 1 − (Eh + Ed ) and rewrite this term, where it becomes the standard
logistic growth with a carrying capacity of 1, associated with 100% of space
being filled. Eliminating Ee gives rise to a two-dimensional system, Eqs
(4)-(5).

Nearby epithelial cells and progenitor cells, stem cells that can differentiate into specific types of epithelial cells only, perform this task. These cells
spread and replicate to fill the empty space left by dead epithelial cells [46–
48]. In this model we do not account for the progenitor cells. Therefore, we
only account for proliferation associated with local epithelial cells.
Stability analysis reveals that in the absence of stretch (s = 0) and with
all positive parameters, (0, 0) is a saddle node and (0, 1) is a stable equilibrium with eigenvalues λ1 = −r − b and λ2 = −p. Given a nonzero initial

In the presence of sustained stretch (s > 0), the Ed nullcline switches

Therefore in the presence of damage, there no longer exists an equilibrium
associated with full recovery.
Exploratory simulations demonstrate that there is a bifurcation with
respect to p, the proliferation rate of epithelial cells. A bifurcation diagram for this parameter, shown in Fig 1, has one transcritical bifurcation at
p∗ = 0.497. The bifurcation diagrams in this manuscript were created using
XPPAUT [49] with code included in the supplementary materials. In this
figure, we show the proportion of space occupied by healthy epithelial cells
as a percentage, which is Eh multiplied by 100. The second equilibrium for
values of p below the bifurcation is not included in the diagram, since it is
non-biological (negative Eh ). For small values of p, the ability of healthy cells
to proliferate and replace dead cells is insufficient and damage causes both
healthy and damaged cells to approach 0%. On the other hand, for values
of p larger than p∗ , the system approaches the stable nonzero equilibrium
(Ed∗ , Eh∗ ), which is closer to (0, 1) for higher values of p even in the presence
of sustained damage.
2.2. Fixed immune response
Next we examine the roles of immune cells, especially neutrophils and
macrophages, by adding several terms to Eqs (1) and (2). We first focused
on dynamics with a fixed immune response, because when we work with the
full model (described in the next section), we only consider parameter sets
that give rise to steady-state solutions in the absence of ventilator-induced
damage. Therefore, we decided to start our model development by analyzing Eh and Ed with immune cells as parameters before including their full
dynamics. The modifications are shown in Eqs (6) and (7).

The physical presence of immune cells, especially first-responder neutrophils, causes small-scale collateral damage as they clear debris [50] and
can be especially deleterious if the response is overzealous [18]. This biological event is modeled as the last term in Eq (6) with cells switching from
a healthy to a damaged state at the rate n. M1 macrophages aid in the
clearance of damaged cells to make room for replacement by new, healthy
cells through subcellular signalling and phagocytosis [14, 47]. The last term
in Eq (7) represents this loss of damaged cells.
The stability analysis is similar to that from the model without the immune response, with additional parameters m, n that can shift steepness of
the nullcline or the speed at which the system approaches or diverges from
an equilibrium. The parameter p once again plays an important role in the
stability of the two critical points, (0, 0) and

There is a transcritical bifurcation when the value of p is varied; given
its similarly to Fig 1, it is not shown here. For the same parameter values
as in Fig 1 (r = 2.6, s = 0.22, b = 0.74) with m = 0.92 and n = 1.6 added,
we obtain the same p∗ = 0.497. The main difference between these models is
that the transcritical bifurcation point p∗ may be lower because of the damage
resulting from macrophages and neutrophils, represented by m and n. The
rate of proliferation of healthy cells may need to be higher to counteract these
effects.
The bifurcation diagram for scaled Eh versus n also has a transcritical
bifurcation (see Fig 2a). For sufficiently low values of n, the nonzero critical

point is stable, but for values above n∗ = 1.364, (0, 0) is the stable equilibrium. Additionally, the two-parameter stability diagram shows a curve
which separates the p/n-space into two stability regimes (see Fig 2b). For
high enough values of n and low enough values of p, the system goes to zero
for both variables. Biologically, this corresponds to a situation in which the
ability of epithelial cells to proliferate is low and there are high levels of immune cells. On the other hand, with low levels of immune cells and a higher
proliferation rate, the system limits to the nonzero equilibrium. It should be
noted that for a large enough p, it would take an extremely high value of n
to overpower proliferation and make (0, 0) the stable critical point. In the
full system the initial conditions for our simulations will have similar properties to the type of steady state in the non-zero stable equilibrium region
of Fig 2b. Varying levels of baseline inflammation exist given differences in
patients’ age and past medical history.
These simple models provide a framework for the dynamics of the epithelium in response to damage and an introductory look into the influence
of the immune response. However, there are many more complex, nonlinear
interactions and events involved in VILI which we will explore in the next
section.

produced by epithelial and/or immune cells and signal to immune cells. Unactivated immune cells become activated by various mediators (pb , ab in the blood and p, a locally) and
perform either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory roles which are meant to remove
debris (Ee ) and promote repair of damaged epithelial cells. Dynamics between cells and
mediators in the blood (not shown) are similar to the detailed dynamics shown for local
inflammation.

2.3. Development of complete model
By adding variables to the two-dimensional system proposed above, we
developed a system of coupled ordinary differential equations to model the interactions between immune cells, epithelial cells, and other mediators, shown
in Fig 3. We also utilize a two-compartment method in which resident immune cells respond to the damaged epithelial cells and nonresident immune
cells are recruited from the bloodstream.
A system of ODEs is ideal for modeling these interactions because of its
ability to capture distinct nonlinearities and feedback loops with relatively
low computational requirements. However, one of the drawbacks of an ODE
model is that it assumes a well-mixed environment, in which all elements of
the model are evenly distributed throughout the given space. Biologically,

this is not always the case. One way to include aspects of the spatial heterogeneity without explicitly modeling space is to use a compartmental model.
Each compartment represents a well mixed environment and, when biologically appropriate, variables can move between compartments. An equation is
developed for the component in each compartment in which it can be located.
Here we choose to model two compartments. The first is the site of inflammation in the lungs, specifically the epithelial cells which provide a barrier
lining the alveolar cells. The second compartment is the adjacent blood vessel
that provides additional immune support to the site of damage. Differentiating between these two compartments allows us to determine the concentrations of various immune cells and other mediators in each separate area
and examine their movement across compartments. A two-compartmental
model accounts for some spatial dynamics that a traditional system of ODEs
cannot, making the model more realistic for a better understanding of the
immune response to VILI.
Fig 3 gives a detailed breakdown of the dynamics in the lung. The dynamics are similar for those cells and mediators in the blood. Cell types
that are tracked in each compartment are stated in Table 1. In the following
subsections, we develop the equations for these variables. The parameters
used in the equations are given in Table 2 with their description and range
used during parameter sampling.
2.3.1. Epithelial cells
We continue with the convention of three subpopulations of epithelial
cells, as in Eqs (6) and (7) with Ee = 1 − Eh − Ed . We add more details
in Eqs (8), (9), and (10) to describe interactions with the immune response
variables that we now explicitly model for a more accurate representation
of the response to VILI. The first term in Eq (8) is still a logistic growth,
representing epithelial cells that spread and replicate to fill Ee . This term
appears negated in Eq (10), modeling the removal of empty space. The next
term in Eq (8) and the first term of Eq (9) represents repair of damaged
cells back to a healthy state. Epithelial cells are prone to self-repair [46],
represented by a baseline rate br , and repair at a faster rate in the presence of
repair mediators variable R, which tracks the level of mediators that promote
epithelial repair such as fibronectin and other epithelial growth factors [48,
51, 52]. The third term in Eq (8) and second in Eq (9) represents collateral
damage to epithelial cells by the influx and activity of the immune system.
This mechanism is modeled via a nonlinear term, which is dependent on

M1 macrophages and neutrophils clear debris from the inflammation site
to make room for healthy epithelial cells to divide and fill the empty space
[17, 46, 47]. The third and fourth terms in Eq (9) represent this phagocytosis of damaged cells by M1 macrophages and activated neutrophils, respectively. Regulation of M1 is modeled by the last multiplier in the term,
representing inhibition by anti-inflammatory mediators (AIM) such as IL10 [14, 48, 54]. The negative feedback loop of AIM inhibiting further proinflammatory functions occurs frequently in our model in a number of equations described below, and we will heretofore refer to this multiplier as inhibition by AIM. Depending on the compartment, the term may utilize the

variable ab (bloodstream) or a (local). The anti-inflammatory and regulatory
role of M2 macrophages and the balance between M1 and M2 phenotypes
is critical for a successful and rapid recovery [16, 48]. The last term of Eqs
(9) and (10), bd Ed , represents the death of Ed (negative in Eq 9) and the
associated gain in the Ee population (positive in Eq 10)).
Dead epithelial cells and “empty” space are grouped together and modeled by the variable Ee in Eq (10). In the epithelial-only model, Ee was
modeled as 1 − Eh − Ed . Since mass in conserved in these three equations
(the sum of terms in the epithelial differential equations is zero), Ee can be
modeled either explicitly, as we chose in Eq (10), or in terms of Eh and Ed .
2.3.2. Pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators
As a signal to other immune cells, damaged epithelial cells release proinflammatory cytokines and other mediators, including TNF-α and matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) [15, 46, 47]. In our equations, we group these
pro-inflammatory mediators (PIM) into two state variables: p in the lungs
and pb in the blood. The release of PIM by damaged epithelial cells leads
to diffusion of PIM into the bloodstream to recruit additional immune cells
[47]. Movement between model compartments is driven by their difference
in concentrations in both Eqs (11) and (12). This simple diffusion term will
be used for other variables throughout our model.
M1 macrophages produce PIM, which upregulate the activation and migration of macrophages to the site of injury; see the second term in Eqs (11)
and (12) [15, 48]. The macrophage population self-regulates by releasing AIM
such as IL-10, thus inhibiting further production of PIM [45]. Therefore the
term includes the same inhibiting multiplier as in Eq (9). The rate of PIM
production by M1 macrophages decreases with increased concentrations of
ab .
Neutrophils are also important producers of pro-inflammatory mediators
such as TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, LTB4, and chemokines, which stimulate the activation of macrophages toward an M1 phenotype [17, 18, 52, 53, 55]. Low
levels of PIM exist in the absence of damage, accounted for by the source
term sp , and we also model natural decay of these mediators.

Anti-inflammatory mediators, such as the anti-inflammatory signaling
caused by IL-4 and IL-10 [56], are represented by Eq (13) in the bloodstream and Eq (14) at the site of damage. They follow the same simple
diffusion behavior as PIM, shown by the first term in each equation below.
AIM are released by both M1 and M2 macrophages [15, 48, 54]. Similarly to
pb , background levels of ab are present in the absence of an immune response,
represented by term four in Eq (13). Natural decay of AIM is accounted for
by the last term in each equation.

2.3.3. Macrophages
Undifferentiated macrophages, also called naive or unactivated, are present
both locally and in the blood. The diffusion term, seen in Eqs (15) and (16),
represents movement between compartments. The baseline diffusion between
compartments is modeled in the same manner as with other variables, but

the rate at which this diffusion occurs is modulated by mediators. Increased
PIM and AIM levels cause undifferentiated macrophages in the bloodstream
to be recruited at a higher rate to the damaged site, where they become activated and perform phagocytic, pro-inflammatory, and pro-resolving roles [15].
This increased flux between compartments due to the presence of pb and ab is
modeled by adding to the baseline diffusion rate (dm0 ). The added term is a
Michaelis-Menten-type term to capture the increasing rate as mediators rise,
with a maximum rate at which these cells can diffuse, (dm0 + km0pd + km0ad ).
The equations also account for early activation in the bloodstream by
PIM and AIM given a high enough concentration of these mediators [14].
Although there is still debate on the types of macrophages that exist in the
bloodstream after being released from the bone marrow, there is evidence
that populations of both M1 and M2 exist in the bloodstream before being
recruited to the site of injury [15, 54]. Thus, we include this process in
our equations in the second terms of Eqs (15) and (16). Undifferentiated
macrophages in the bloodstream can change phenotype to M1 or M2 after
interacting with PIM or AIM, respectively, modeled by a Hill-type term. This
nonlinearity accounts for the sufficient amount of PIM or AIM necessary to
precipitate activation as well as a saturation of this process.
Once pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, TGF-β, and interleukins (ILs) [47] are released by damaged epithelial cells, undifferentiated
macrophages receive these signals and differentiate into the M1 phenotype
[57]. A pro-inflammatory response characterizes the early stages of the immune response [48, 52]. The second term in Eqs 15 and 16 represent activation of undifferentiated macrophages to the pro-inflammatory phenotype,
downregulated by the anti-inflammatory response through an inhibition multiplier. In this term, M2 macrophages can also be activated directly from the
naive phenotype by various repair and anti-inflammatory mediators involved
in the repair of epithelial cells [47, 48].
Using the same inhibition multiplier as previously, AIM inhibit differentiation to M1 as part of their regulatory role in the inflammatory process,
although a complete understanding of these mechanisms is yet to be uncovered [15, 45, 47]. In the absence of injury, lungs contain a low number of
undifferentiated macrophages which patrol the surrounding area [46]. “Patrolling” macrophages are also prevalent in the bloodstream. The third term
in Eq (15) represents a constant source of undifferentiated macrophages from
the circulation [48]. We also account for natural decay of all macrophage phenotypes in Eqs (15) through (20).

Similarly to naive macrophages, M1 macrophages move between compartments. The presence of pro-inflammatory mediators, which act as recruiters,
increases the rate of diffusion, shown in the first term of Eq (17) [15]. The second term represents differentiation from the naive state, as described above.
Macrophages exhibit high plasticity, and based on the mediators and
other immune cells they encounter, they can switch phenotype and perform different or enhanced functions; this plasticity is not yet fully understood [14, 48]. M1 macrophages are primarily responsible for producing
PIM, thereby recruiting other immune cells to the damaged area [54]. M2
macrophages are considered pro-resolving and downregulate PIM. Both M1
and M2 macrophages phagocytize apoptotic cells such as neutrophils [52].
The shift from an overall pro-inflammatory phase to an anti-inflammatory
phase in the course of the immune response is highly dependent upon a shift
in macrophage behavior, specifically the shift from a mainly M1 response to
a mainly M2 response [15, 47, 54].

One of the primary ways this shift is achieved is through the inhibition
of M0 to M1 differentiation by anti-inflammatory mediators, as described
previously. Additionally, when pro-inflammatory macrophages phagocytize
apoptotic neutrophils, they shift towards a more anti-inflammatory phenotype. This results in suppression of the release of pro-inflammatory mediators
and production of pro-resolving mediators [50, 53]. We account for this shift
by including the third term in Eq (18), proportional to apoptotic neutrophil
phagocytosis which causes M1 macrophages to shift to the M2 phenotype.
This term also includes inhibition of M1 function by AIM. It has been shown
in some studies that M2 macrophages can switch to an M1 phenotype [58],
although this idea is not currently widely accepted. Thus, we choose to
include only the shift from M1 to M2.

diffuse between compartments as illustrated previously, shown in the first
terms in Eqs (19) and (20). M2 macrophages produce anti-inflammatory mediators which recruit and promote differentiation to more M2 macrophages,
described in the second term of both equations. They release cytokines that
trigger the repair phase of the immune response [15, 48]. This repair phase
includes repair mediators (discussed below in Eq (25)), which play a direct
role in the reconstruction of healthy epithelial cells and resolution of damage
[48].

2.3.4. Neutrophils
Neutrophils are considered the first responders to injury [18, 47]. Generated in the bone marrow [17], free-flowing neutrophils circulate in the vasculature at baseline levels, described as N0b and represented by the first term
in Eq (21) [18]. In the presence of injury, neutrophils are activated and
recruited to the damaged site through pro-inflammatory mediators such as
TNF-α, IL-1β, and other chemokines and cytokines [18, 55]. This recruitment is represented by the first term in Eqs (21) and (22). On the other hand,
anti-inflammatory mediators, including macrophage-produced resolvins and
protectins, inhibit further recruitment of neutrophils [50]. Similarly to the
differentiation of macrophages, it is assumed that a higher concentration

above baseline is required for neutrophils to activate, and that this activation rate saturates. Therefore, a Hill-type term with a maximum rate of
kn0p and a constant of xn0p is used to model activation of neutrophils by
PIM. To model the inhibition of neutrophil activation by AIM, we include
the same inhibition multiplier as previously described. The effectiveness of
these AIMs to inhibit this process is controlled by ab∞ . We also account for
intrinsic decay of neutrophils in the last term of Eqs (21) through (24).

Neutrophils go through a multi-step process of rolling along and subsequently adhering to the surface of the endothelium. Then neutrophils transmigrate to the injury site either through or between endothelial cells [17, 18].
This process is assumed to be driven not by a concentration difference in
neutrophils between the compartments but rather is a direct consequence of
activation. Therefore, neutrophil transmigration, the first term in Eq (23),
is modeled from the bloodstream to the site of injury by a linear term with
rate kn .
Activated neutrophils that have transmigrated through the endothelium
and reached the site of injury release pro-inflammatory mediators, as discussed previously in Eq (12). During infection, neutrophils play an important
role by phagocytizing pathogens [53], but during VILI a main role of neutrophils is the recruitment of macrophages, particularly to promote a more
pro-inflammatory environment for the clearance of damaged and dead cells
[18].
Neutrophils become apoptotic, modeled by the second term of Eq (23)
[47]. In this state, they are phagocytized by M1 and M2 macrophages (second
and third terms of Eq (24), respectively) and no longer contribute to the
production of PIM [17, 52, 59]. Phagocytosis by M1 macrophages is inhibited
by AIM using our standard functional form for the inhibition multiplier.
AIM do not inhibit phagocytosis by M2 macrophages since AIM support the

2.3.5. Repair mediators
The direct contribution of alveolar macrophages to the repair of epithelial
cells is not completely understood, although macrophage involvement in the
repair process has been widely demonstrated [48]. M2 macrophages produce
various mediators that promote repair of epithelial cells. We do not model
each of these explicitly, instead we group them together in one variable called
R. These secreted mediators include prostaglandin E2 , chemokines such as
CCL2, TGF-β, fibronectin 1 and other epithelial growth factors [48, 51, 52].
The production of R by M2 macrophages is modeled by the first term in Eq
(25). The second term models intrinsic decay of these mediators.

With a system of ODEs that captures the most important aspects of
the immune response to VILI, the following sections demonstrate how we
analyzed the model to understand the parameter space, determine the most
sensitive parameters and other influential predictors of model output, and
modulate a particular case of model-generated dynamics to lessen long-term
epithelial damage.
2.4. Sampling method for parameters: Latin hypercube sampling
Because of the large number of variables and parameters, mathematical
and statistical techniques need to be used to analyze the system and find
parameter sets that generate biologically realistic dynamics of immune cell

populations included in this model. Some parameters may be easily obtained
from the literature, such as half-lives of immune cells. However, most of the
parameters have not yet been evaluated due to the need for experimental data
or are altogether impossible to obtain through current experimental methods. As an initial step towards determining initial conditions and parameters
for this model we use Latin hypercube sampling (LHS). Introduced in 1979
[60], LHS is a sampling method which generates random, unique parameter
sets, such that the produced parameter values are selected according to a
distribution; in our case, a uniform distribution. For LHS with uniform distributions assumed for each parameter, to generate n desired parameter sets,
the algorithm splits the determined range into n evenly-spaced subintervals
and each interval is sampled exactly once [61]. This is particularly useful for
our exploratory simulations because the distributions of the parameters are
unknown.
Using MATLAB functions adapted from Kirschner et al. [62], all parameters were sampled except the rate of damage sd due to ventilation. We
used simulations to explore parameter space by sampling near transients associated with different types of disease progression. We accepted parameter
sets if they were associated with a steady state solution and defined the final
parameters ranges based on the maximum and minimum value of the parameters in the acceptable sets. See Table 2 for ranges used for each parameter.
Using LHS with these ranges we generated 100,000 parameter sets. Future
work could calibrate cohorts to data from different experimental or clinical
groups and then use the analysis methods here to compare dynamics and
parameters that drive differences between experimental or clinical groups.
2.5. Cohorts: Healthy, Moderate Inflammation, & Severe Inflammation
We needed to start our simulation from initial conditions associated with
a steady state, so that when ventilation was simulated we were seeing changes
in the dynamics only due to the ventilator. For all 100,000 parameter sets
we ran the model for 800 hours without ventilator-induced damage (sd = 0)
using three different initial conditions to determine if a steady-state condition was reached in the absence of ventilation. The first initial condition was
related to the initial simulations used to develop the sampling ranges and
gave rise to 25,195 sets that reached steady state. Additionally, we checked
whether parameter sets that did not reach a steady state from these initial
conditions could reach a steady state from an initial condition with all variables set to zero except for Eh (0) = 0.75 and Ed (0) = 0.25 (starting with

damaged tissue and no immune response) or initial conditions with all variables set to zero except for M 1(0) = 50 (starting with an activated immune
response and healthy tissue). These other initial conditions added another
1,104 sets that reached a steady state, bringing the total to 26,299. Any
parameter sets that did not result in an equilibrium state by 800 hours from
these three initial conditions were not simulated with ventilation. We simulated these 26,299 parameter sets with ventilator-induced damage starting
from their steady state levels. Simulations were run for 200 hours with ventilation for the first two hours (a nonzero damage rate), a duration comparable
with murine experiments [63, 64].
Many of these sets had initial conditions associated with a severely inflamed lung without ventilation, which did not seem biologically realistic.
To correct for this we eliminated sets based on their initial condition for
Ee (empty/dead cells). We performed all of the analysis below with three
different thresholds to see whether the exclusion of these parameter sets affected the results. In this paper we focus on the 23,086 parameters sets that
had Ee (0) < 50% and show a summary of all results for Ee (0) < 25% and
Ee (0) < 75% in the supplementary materials. We did not find any major
differences when varying this inclusion threshold.
Simulations were separated into three categories of disease progression:
1) healthy epithelial cells sufficiently cover the alveoli to functional normally
or existence of 2) moderate or 3) severe inflammation and associated tissue
damage. These progressions are called healthy, moderate inflammation, and
severe inflammation, respectively.
To quantify these three different states, we divided percentages of healthy
epithelial cells into categories:

564

• Healthy: Eh ≥ 90%

565

• Moderate inflammation: 50% ≤ Eh < 90%

566

• Severe inflammation: 0% ≤ Eh < 50%

567
568
569
570
571
572

In this way, each parameter set can be classified into three different categories based on their Eh values either before or after ventilation. Thus,
sets are classified by their initial conditions and then again after simulation
with ventilation. These parameter sets, their corresponding transients, and
the outcomes they generate were used to develop a virtual cohort representing a variety of immune system dynamics. The cohort was then used to

2.6. eFAST
We used several tools to perform a sensitivity analysis of model parameters. A common method is calculating partial rank correlation coefficients
(PRCCs), but results are only reliable for monotonic relationships between
parameters and variables. Our model output does not fit this criteria. Marino
et al. suggest the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (eFAST), a
variance-based method for non-linear, non-monotonic relationships [61]. The
greatest drawback of eFAST compared to PRCC is the computation time.
eFAST, developed by Saltelli et al. [65], Saltelli & Bolado [66], and Saltelli
et al. [67] is the extended version of FAST, originally developed by Cukier et
al. [68], Schaibly & Shuler [69], and Collins & Avissar [70]. Parameters are
varied and the resulting variation in model output is calculated using statistical variance. The algorithm varies each parameter at different frequencies
by creating a sinusoidal function, called a search curve, and then sampling
parameter values along the function. Fourier analysis measures the influence of the parameter’s frequency on model output. First-order sensitivity
Si for a parameter i is calculated by varying only i and leaving the rest constant. Total-order sensitivity ST i is calculated by varying i using a unique,
higher frequency and varying the other parameters using lower non-unique
frequencies. This total-order sensitivity captures non-linear interactions between parameters in addition to changes in model output. We implement
the method by Marino et al. [61] to calculate Si and ST i and determine
their statistical significance of for each parameter. A “dummy parameter” is
included in the parameter set and its eFAST index is compared to the other
parameters found in the model.
MATLAB functions by Kirschner et al. [62] are available online to perform eFAST. We obtain 65 values of each parameter on a search curve and
repeat this process for five unique search curves since different ones can generate slightly different samples. Sensitivity can be calculated at specific time
points for the desired variable.
2.7. Random forest decision tree
Aside from more conventional sensitivity analysis measures, we chose a
few alternative methods that require less computation time and can include
other features of the model besides parameters. One of these alternatives is

a random forest decision tree. A decision tree algorithm is a classification
tool that uses the given properties of an individual or object to determine
into which category it should fall [71, 72]. In this case, each parameter set
in the virtual cohort has a number of predictors and outputs: parameters
and any other characteristics from the transients that can be quantified or
given a classification value. The algorithm takes a training set, a subset of
the cohort about which all predictors and outputs are known, and can train
the algorithm to classify virtual cohort members into specific categories.
An output of the model that we are particularly concerned with predicting
is the patient’s outcome, as described in the previous section. The decision
tree generated from the training set makes predictions for the rest of the
virtual cohort members about whether each one will fall into one of the three
outcomes: healthy, moderate inflammation, or severe inflammation. The
tree contains branches at which specific parameters are chosen to best assist
in classification. The parameter values of each “individual” in the cohort
determines the path along the tree until it reaches the most likely outcome
based on the training set.
Since a decision tree simply takes a series of values for each predictor
and is not dependent on the model itself, measures besides just parameters
can be used. We included supplementary predictors calculated from the
transients, described in Table 3. Adding these predictors allowed for the
possibility that the best classifiers of outcome could be not only parameters
but also properties of the transients. This knowledge could provide additional
information about metrics for experimentalists and clinicians to keep track
of and identify early warning signs for undesirable results.
For added robustness against overfitting [72], we use a random forest
decision tree algorithm, in which a user-specified number of randomly chosen
parameters are candidates at each branch; then the algorithm selects one to
be the splitting variable from that smaller group. The rf function in R
generates 500 decision trees as the “forest” along with several other useful
output metrics. One metric in particular is the importance value of each
parameter or characteristic, calculated from the Gini Index. The importance
value is a measure of how important any given parameter was in determining
the outcome of each parameter set in the virtual cohort. Because of the
large number of parameters in the model, this can provide intuition on which
parameters and other characteristics of the transients are most influential in
determining outcomes. The R and MATLAB code used for this method are
provided in the supplementary materials.

3. Results
Our aim is to understand how recruitment of the immune response and
its interactions with epithelial cells translate to specific outcomes and what
dynamics are driving this process. Therefore, we developed an ODE model of
the immune response to ventilator-induced damage, which explicitly tracks
macrophage phenotype and epithelial cells. A fixed point and stability analysis of the epithelial subsystem reveals the long-term stability of a simplified
version of the system under various conditions, and how changes in those
conditions affect stability. Using Latin hypercube sampling, we generated
parameter sets that replicate different possible responses to VILI and created a virtual cohort of patients. We also perform an analysis of the large
parameter space by comparing various techniques to determine predictors of
outcome and/or processes that could be targeted to modulate outcome.
3.1. Sample Transients and Cohort Breakdown
This model can generate a variety of dynamics, similar to expected responses of patients on a ventilator. There is significant variability between
outcomes as well as within them. Fig 4 shows examples of these different
dynamics for healthy epithelial cells and M0, M1, and M2 macrophages using a case of each of the three outcomes: healthy, moderate inflammation,
and severe inflammation. Simulations were run in MATLAB using the code
provided in the supplementary materials.
We generated 100,000 parameter sets using LHS with parameter ranges
given in Table 2. Fig 5 shows the breakdown of these parameter sets based
on whether or not the dynamics lead to a steady-state system in the absence
of ventilation, their classification before ventilation, and the resulting state
(healthy, moderate inflammation, and severe inflammation) after 200 hours,
the first 2 hours being ventilation. We also rejected any parameter sets with
Ee (0) ≥ 50%, since this would not be biologically realistic. The top number
in each box is the total number of parameter sets in that category, and that
number is further broken down by the category in which they start (column
1) and end (column 2). For the first column, the number in parentheses is
the number of sets that started in that category but ended in a different one.
Conversely, the number in parentheses in the second column shows the sets
that ended in a certain outcome but did not start there. These numbers
serve as a summary of how damage may affect outcome for the variety of
behaviors in the virtual cohort. We will analyze all 23,086 sets that reach

that could occur. In the future, experimental data could help narrow down
responses.
3.2. Determining Predictors and Driving Dynamics
Our model has 18 variables and 67 parameters. Using a variety of mathematical, statistical, and computational methods, we determined the parameters and other predictors that stand out, those to which output is most
sensitive and may help differentiate or predict what is driving outcome. In
this section we explain and compare the results of each method.
3.2.1. Correlations and significance testing highlight specific parameters
As an initial step towards understanding relationships between parameters and model output, we calculated the correlations of parameters and
predictors with outcome. There were some correlations between predictors
that are very high, but are measuring similar things; for example, maximum
M1 and minimum M1. We excluded these since they do not provide new
or useful information. Aside from these, there are only a few correlations
between parameters or between parameters and predictors that are higher
than R = 0.3; notable pairs are shown in Fig 6 using random samples from
each outcome for better visibility of the points. For kmne , the rate of collateral damage to epithelial cells by macrophages and neutrophils, parameter

sets that result in moderate and severe inflammation outcomes have a significant correlation with the Eh ratio at 0.5 hours, shown in Fig 6a. The
Eh ratio and kmne have the following correlations for each outcome: healthy
R = 0.1 (not shown), moderate inflammation R = 0.67, and severe inflammation R = 0.82. The br parameter, representing the baseline repair rate
for epithelial cells, has the following correlations with the same Eh ratio for
each type of outcome, healthy R = 0.29, moderate inflammation R = 0.41,
and severe inflammation R = 0.37, shown in Fig 6b. Visual inspection of
both graphs shows possible nonlinear behavior that should be investigated
further. The only other pair with a correlation above 0.3 is sm , the source
rate for naive macrophages, and the maximum and minimum values of M2
macrophages over the entire simulation. The parameter sm and maximum
M2 have the following correlations: healthy R = 0.32; moderate inflammation R = 0.3; severe inflammation R = 0.3. Fig 6c shows these correlations;
sm and minimum M2 is not shown but have similar results.
We also performed hypothesis testing for predictors (excluding binary
variables). The Kruskal-Wallis test is an alternative to ANOVA when the
variable distributions are not normal [73]. Due to our choice of a uniform
sampling distribution for LHS, parameter distributions for the 23,086 sets
are roughly uniform. We categorized all parameter sets by their outcome
(healthy, moderate inflammation, severe inflammation) and compared them.
If any of the three groups had a statistically significant difference (p-value less
than 0.01), a Wilcoxon test was performed on each pair (healthy and moderate inflammation, healthy and severe inflammation, moderate and severe
inflammation) to determine which groups were different from one another.
P-values for the Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests were adjusted using the
Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to control for the false discovery rate [74].
Knowledge of which parameters and other predictors are different between
groups based on outcome provides insight into predicting outcomes and which
predictors might best influence the immune response to damage.
35 out of 81 parameters and predictors returned results for a statistically
significant difference between at least two groups and 14 gave statistically
significant differences between all three groups. Table 4 shows a summary of
the results from the various methods used to examine predictors’ significance
in determining model output. Column 1 of Table 4 shows the predictors in
which all three groups were different from one another, as determined by the
Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests. Results in columns 2-5 are described in
the following sections. Box plots of a subset of predictors in which all three

3.2.2. Parameter Sensitivity with eFAST
Since outcome of Eh is the metric by which we determine health of the individual, we calculated eFAST indexes for Eh at 30 minutes, two hours (end
of ventilation), and six hours. We calculated first-order and total-order sensitivities Si and ST i , respectively. Fig 8 shows results for the parameters with
p-value < 0.02. Parameters kn (rate of migration of Nb to lung), xmne (Hilltype constant for effectiveness of macrophages and neutrophils in damaging
epithelial cells), xm0a (Hill-type constant for effectiveness of differentiation
of M0 by a), br (baseline repair of damaged cells), and ken (phagocytosis of
damaged cells by N ) are sensitive for several time points. Comparing Si and

ST i in Fig 8, it is possible that nonlinear interaction between parameters
affects model output more at 6 hours than at 2 hours. Parameters with a
significant Si may also be better candidates for treatment than those with a
significant ST i because first-order sensitivity measures sensitivity of Eh based
only on fluctuations in a single parameter. For this reason and since many of
the same parameters are significant for first-order and total-order sensitivity,
we show results for first-order sensitivity in Columns 5-7 of Table 4, ordered
from lowest p-value to highest and for the three time points specified.
3.2.3. Random forest algorithm to determine predictors
The randomness of the decision tree algorithm means that each random
forest generated and its resulting importance values are slightly different.
To offset any unusual results generated by the randomness, we replicated the
process of randomly selecting a training set and generating importance values
from the random forest 1000 times. Fig 9 shows the average and standard
deviations of the top ten importance values generated.
Notice that the standard deviations are small enough so that although
some of the top importance values may change order in different random forest simulations, in general the most important predictors remained the same
across numerous simulations. Furthermore, several of the top ten predictors
were found to be significant by the Kruskal-Wallis Test, and br and kmne
are shared by random forest and eFAST. (see Table 4). The consistency of
the importance of these parameters and predictors using different methods
supports the idea that they play a significant role in the sensitivity of model

output and determining or differentiating outcomes.
3.3. Modulating recovery: a case study of select transients
Fig 10 shows nine examples of transients that started in one disease progression category and ended in another. We used the information gained in
the parameter analysis to identify key targets for treatment that could modulate damage, especially in the case of a patient starting in one state and
ending in a different, negative outcome after ventilation. The goal is to return the cohort member to its original steady-state earlier, since the inability
to recover from a 2-hour vent after 200 hours or more could be detrimental
to long-term health.
Our analysis shows that the parameters br , the rate of self-repair of
healthy epithelial cells, kmne , the rate of collateral damage by macrophages
and neutrophils to epithelial cells, xmne , the Hill-type constant which regulates the effectiveness of macrophages and neutrophils in damaging epithelial
cells, and ken , the rate of phagocytosis of damaged cells by neutrophils, are
some of the most influential parameters and thus could inform targets for
treatment. It is also important to note that different interventions could
begin and end at any time during or after ventilation, so we examined interventions at several time points (see Fig 11).

Figure 11: Modulating parameters based on parameter analysis improves outcome in case study. Starting with a parameter set that gives rise to an Eh transient
that starts healthy and ends in a moderate inflammation state, we applied various treatment strategies by changing three key parameters, br (rate at which healthy epithelial cells
self-repair), kmne (rate of collateral damage to epithelial cells by macrophages and neutrophils), and xmne (Hill-type constant which regulates the effectiveness of macrophages
and neutrophils in damaging epithelial cells). Results for various changes are shown for
healthy epithelial cells (a, b, c) and percent of M1 macrophages (d, e, f). Treatment was
started at 0, 2, or 4 hours after the start of ventilation, denoted by solid, dotted, and
dot-dashed lines, respectively, and lasted for 48 hours. The original parameter values are
br = 0.33, kmne = 0.38, and xmne = 0.92. Black transients show the original dynamics
without intervention. Orange transients represent values of each parameter that are insufficient to mediate prolonged macrophage activation. Blue transients show values that
are sufficient to bring about resolution, depending on intervention time.

We intervened in a case that starts healthy and ends in moderate inflammation. Note in Fig 11, the original Eh transient begins recovery to healthy
after the two-hour ventilation period, but by the end of the 200-hour period,
is at a lower Eh value. This is coupled with a transient for M1 in which the
pro-inflammatory phenotype increases to 40-45% and stays in this range.
Increasing br by various amounts has increasingly positive effects on longterm epithelial health. Lower values of br increase Eh slightly and an earlier
intervention can generate a higher peak of Eh around five hours, but does
not continue increasing at this rate regardless of intervention time. If br is
increased substantially for a significant duration of treatment time, healthy
epithelial cells reach the healthy steady-state after ventilation and do not
decrease again. Shown in Figures 11a and 11d, doubling br to 0.66 is not
enough to generate recovery, but increasing br by a factor of four to 1.32
does result in a healthy outcome. For an insufficient treatment duration and
value of br , levels of Eh will be higher until treatment ends and then decrease
back to the same level as the original simulation. For a long enough treatment
duration, the proportion of healthy epithelial cells will remain high even after
treatment ends. For br = 0.66, the intervention time does not improve health
in the long run, whereas for br = 1.32, intervention at either 0 or 2 hours is
sufficient to bring about recovery while intervention at 4 hours is not.
The parameter kmne has an inverse relationship with epithelial health;
thus, decreasing the parameter provides better results. Decreasing kmne
slightly can increase the rate of recovery slightly but not enough to change
the outcome to resolved. However, with a significant enough decrease of
kmne , M1 activation peaks around hour 10 and decreases back to its original
levels. The original simulation shows M1 activation leveling off at a high
percentage of activation (Fig 11e). The modulated return to baseline levels
is paired with a healthy outcome for epithelial cells (Fig 11b). For higher
values of kmne , results are about the same for any intervention time 4 hours
or less after the beginning of ventilation. Note in Fig 11 that the time at
which intervention begins matters somewhat for changes in br but not for
kmne . Figures 11b and 11e show that half of the original value of kmne (0.38
to 0.19) is not low enough to change the outcome; multiplying by a factor of
0.1 to kmne = 0.04, on the other hand, is sufficient to change the outcome to
healthy.
We also increase the parameter xmne . Increasing this value causes the
presence of macrophages and neutrophils to be less effective in damaging
epithelial cells. Similarly to the other treatments, sufficient changes to xmne
41

862

bring about long-term recovery and the time at which intervention begins
is not as important. Figures 11c and 11f show doubling xmne to 1.85 is
insufficient to change the outcome, and increasing xmne by a factor of four
to 3.69 is sufficient.
Finally, we increase ken . This increases the rate at which neutrophils
phagocytize damaged cells, making room for new, healthy cells. Interestingly,
although ken is shown to be an important parameter in our analysis, even
increasing the parameter by a factor of ten to 1.52 is insufficient to make any
real changes in the epithelial and macrophage populations. Since there was
no significant change, we do not show this treatment in Fig 11.
We also examine the results of combination therapy that could include
regulation of two or three parameters. Together, changes in parameter values that would be insufficient on their own are able to regulate macrophage
activation and bring epithelial cells back to a healthy state. Additionally,
higher values of br and xmne and lower values of kmne precipitate a quicker
recovery from damage. Intervention time is important for parameter values near the threshold, but not for parameter values sufficiently above or
below the threshold. Intervention time may make a difference in the ending
steady-state values of Eh or M 1, depending on the parameters. Many combinations could be formulated; Fig 12 shows two cases in which two parameter
changes were insufficient to bring about recovery individually but are sufficient when combined. The orange curves show br = 0.99 and kmne = 0.19
and the blue curves show xmne = 2.31 and ken = 1.52, which bring about
long-term recovery for all three intervention times.
For other cases starting in a healthy state and ending in moderate inflammation or severe inflammation, a high enough br can bring about resolution
in some cases. In general, earlier intervention times result in a faster rate
of recovery, but there are varied responses to changes in kmne , xmne , and
ken . Even for transients with similar Eh and M 1 dynamics, reactions to
treatments may be different, reinforcing the uniqueness of each individual
member of the virtual cohort.

The spectrum of macrophage activation has been a recently growing field
of research [10, 14, 15], and with the increase in the need for mechanical
ventilation due to COVID-19, a better understanding of and treatment for
VILI is of great concern. Mathematical models have studied a host of causes

Figure 12: Treatment by combining parameter changes can result in a positive
outcome. Changes in br , kmne , xmne and ken that are insufficient on their own (Fig

treatment of br = 0.99 and kmne = 0.19 and blue curves show that of xmne = 2.31 and
ken = 1.52. Duration of treatment in each case is 48 hours, and all intervention times are
successful in a long-term recovery.

of lung inflammation, including bacterial and viral infections and allergic
reactions. Our model combines the varied effects of macrophage activation
with a more detailed epithelial subsystem to model ventilator-induced lung
injury. These features help to provide a better understanding of how the
components of immune response, including those associated with the different
macrophage phenotypes, play a role in whether or not there is resolution after
ventilator-induced damage.
We account for recruitment of circulating immune cells from the bloodstream and their contribution to the immune response using a two- compartmental model. Our model incorporates a number of factors involved in
the immune response, including naive M0, pro-inflammatory M1 and antiinflammatory M2 macrophages, three states of epithelial cells (healthy, damaged, dead), activated and unactivated neutrophils, and various mediators
used to signal between cells. The model consists of 18 state equations and 67
parameters. Because of its large size and the paucity of experimental data,
we used Latin hypercube sampling to find biologically meaningful parameter
sets, producing a total of 23,086 acceptable parameter sets. This “virtual
cohort” produces a variety of dynamics that can be generated by the model.
We classified parameter sets into categories of healthy, moderate inflamma43

cells at the beginning or end of the simulation. The resulting cohort simulations are used to determine the unique characteristics and properties of the
transients that are linked to outcome and to determine candidate treatments.
We utilized several methods to determine the most important parameters
for model output, particularly epithelial health. Using eFAST, a sensitivity
analysis method for non-linear, non-monotonic ODEs, we found parameters
that, when fluctuated, caused a statistically significant difference in output than that generated by a dummy parameter. We then compared these
results with more non-conventional and less computationally intensive methods. The random forest decision tree algorithm generated values denoting
the importance of parameters and other predictors on epithelial health and
is particularly useful for large data sets, such as the parameter sets in our
virtual cohort. Additionally, significance testing determined statistically significant differences in parameters grouped by outcome.
We were able to not only include parameter values in this analysis but
also other predictors later found to be important, including the M1 peak ratio
and the difference between Eh initial condition and ending value. Three of
the most important parameters were br , the rate of self-repair of epithelial
cells, kmne , the rate at which macrophages and neutrophils cause collateral
damage to epithelial cells, xmne , the Hill-type coefficient that regulates the
effectiveness of that collateral damage, and ken , the rate of phagocytosis of
damaged epithelial cells by neutrophils. These important parameters and
predictors were confirmed by at least two of the methods used.
Analysis showed that properties and parameters related to epithelial repair and M1 activation and de-activation were especially predictive of outcome. We used br , kmne , xmne , and ken to simulate treatments for a parameter
set in the virtual cohort that started healthy and ended in a moderate inflammation disease progression. We found that modulating br is effective in most
cases, and the other four can be helpful in some. The chosen case responded
differently to treatments and these were paired with varied M1 activation
dynamics, indicating that macrophage activation is tied to epithelial health
in VILI.
Our approach of developing a virtual cohort and selecting important parameters is a first step in identifying the driving mechanisms behind VILI
and how they contribute to outcomes. However, experimental data will be
necessary to better understand the immune response to VILI and identify biologically realistic dynamics. Concentrations of macrophages and neutrophils,

as well as a way to experimentally measure epithelial health at multiple time
points would be extremely beneficial. Preliminary data is currently being
collected, which can be explored in future work.
Another area of further study is determining why some virtual cases can
recover with a short intervention time while others need indefinite treatment.
We hypothesize that this has to do with patient-specific initial conditions and
parameters but more work should be done to obtain a definite answer. This
would help determine the risk of VILI for patients who undergo ventilation,
since patients generally need ventilation because of a preexisting condition
and do not begin ventilation in a completely healthy state. In fact, this model
could be extended to include other types of injury such as a bacterial or viral
infection to study the interactions between the different types of injury and
how they contribute to patient outcome.
In conclusion, our model contributes to the current understanding of the
immune response in the lungs, and is an important first step for VILI. Our parameter analysis using a variety of methods provides new insight into potential interventions during and after ventilation to mediate VILI. Experimental
data will greatly improve our ability to suggest treatments. Furthermore, the
model can be extended to include other types of injury that create the need
for mechanical ventilation in the first place.
