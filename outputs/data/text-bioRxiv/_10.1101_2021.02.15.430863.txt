Abstract: Various COVID-19 vaccine candidates are currently under clinical trial. However, no
live attenuated vaccine has been developed yet, despite their generally high efficacy. Here, we
established temperature-sensitive mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2, whose growth was
significantly slower than that of the parent strain at 37°C. One of the strains, A50-18, which
presented mutations in nonstructural protein 14, did not replicate at all at 37°C in vitro. In vivo
experiments demonstrated that this strain replicated inefficiently in the lungs of Syrian hamsters,
and intra-nasal inoculation induced sufficient anti-SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies to
protect against wild type virus infection. These results suggest that the A50-18 strain could be a
promising live attenuated vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2.
One Sentence Summary: A live attenuated virus provided immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in an
animal model, making it a promising vaccine candidate.

A new emerging infectious disease arose in Wuhan, China in 2019; the responsible pathogen was
identified as a novel coronavirus (1). This coronavirus strain is related to SARS-CoV, which also
emerged in China in 2002, and thus, the novel virus was named SARS-CoV-2, while the
infection is known as COVID-19 (2). COVID-19 has been reported to cause pneumonia and lung
inflammation, and even more severe symptoms, with elderly people especially vulnerable. To
date, approximately 100 million people have been infected globally, and over 2 million people
have died of this infectious disease (3).
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the
Betacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family. The coronavirus genome is approximately
30 kb long and contains several open reading frames (ORFs) encoding two large polyproteins,

ORF1a and ORF1ab, and four structural proteins–spike (S), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N)
and membrane (M) (4). The ORF1ab transcript encodes ORF1a and ORF1b by programmed
ribosomal frameshift, and the polyproteins are cleaved to give rise to sixteen nonstructural
proteins (NSPs) by the self-cleavage activity of NSP3 and NSP5 proteases (5, 6). Among the
structural proteins, S protein, which is a large glycoprotein on the virion surface, attaches to a
host cell receptor for entry (7). It was reported that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), thus antiRBD antibodies should neutralize the virus (8). Several vaccine candidates currently in
development target the S protein or its RBD.
Live attenuated vaccines have been developed by various experimental methods. Heterogeneous
adaptation is a traditional strategy for isolating attenuated viruses that cannot readily propagate
in human cells. For example, the VZV vOka strain was generated by passaging the virus several
times in guinea pig embryo fibroblasts (9); the measles virus AIK strain was isolated by passage
in sheep kidney cell lines (10-12); and rubella virus vaccine strains were developed by passage in
Japanese quail embryo fibroblasts or rabbit kidney cells (13, 14). Temperature-sensitive (TS)
strains are also selected to create live attenuated vaccines that cannot replicate at body
temperature. The AIK-C strain was derived by further passage of the AIK strain in chicken
embryo cells at 33°C. It can replicate at 35°C, but not at 37°C or 39°C (15). The rubella virus
TO-336 vaccine strain can also replicate at 35°C, but not at 39°C (16). Furthermore, a live
attenuated influenza virus vaccine was developed by reassortment of viruses generated from a
cold-adapted donor virus, which had temperature-sensitivity-related mutations in six vRNA
segments (17, 18). This attenuated influenza virus could replicate at 25–33°C, but not at 37°C
(18-20). In the case of coronaviruses, it was reported that certain NSP3 mutations in the mouse
hepatitis virus (MHV), another member of the Betacoronavirus genus, lead to temperature
sensitivity (21).
Here, we generated four TS SARS-CoV-2 strains from a clinical isolate. Among the obtained
mutant strains, strain A50-18 showed a unique phenotype with impaired replication at 37°C and
normal proliferation at 33–35°C, meaning that it was able to replicate in the nasal cavity but not
in the lungs. In vivo analysis in a Syrian hamster model revealed that this strain did not cause
lung lesions or weight loss, unlike the parental virus. Furthermore, pre-infection with the novel
virus prevented pathogenicity due to parental strain infection. These results suggested that A5018 may be a novel live attenuated vaccine candidate for the prevention of COVID-19.

Isolation and phenotypic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 temperature-sensitive strains
To isolate TS strains of SARS-CoV-2, we generated a library of viruses with random mutations
from the clinical isolate B-1 virus (Accession number: LC603286). A total of 659 viral plaques
were isolated from the library and subjected to screening. For this purpose, Vero cells were
infected with all the virus clones and cultured at 32°C or 37°C and observed daily to evaluate
cytopathic effect (CPE). During the process, we selected four TS strains that caused CPE at 32°C
3 days post-infection (dpi), but none at 37°C.
To analyze the temperature sensitivity in detail, we then evaluated the growth kinetics of the
isolated TS strains at 32°C, 34°C or 37°C (Fig. 1A). Under 32°C and 34°C conditions, all TS

strains replicated comparably to the parent B-1 virus. However, at 37°C, replication of all TS
strains was relatively slower or smaller in scale than the parent strain. The peak viral growth of
the H50-11 strain was delayed by 1–2 d compared with the parent B-1 virus, but its maximum
viral titer was not significantly different (p=0.38). L50-33 and L50-40 strains hardly proliferated
at 37°C, and the viral titers were less than 104 TCID50/mL even at 5 dpi, which is 104 times
lower than the maximum titer of the B-1 strain. Interestingly, the A50-18 strain showed a unique
phenotype, since no infectious viruses were detected in the culture medium at 37°C (the TCID50
was under the assay’s limit of detection).
Next, these four TS strains were subjected to deep-sequence analysis to identify the mutations
involved in the TS phenotype (Table 1). The A50-18 strain had a total of six missense mutations
in NSP14, S, E and N proteins. The H50-11 strain showed four missense mutations in NSP3,
NSP16 and S proteins. There were two missense mutations in NSP3 in the L50-33 strain and a
total of three missense mutations in NSP3 and S proteins in the L50-40 strains were observed.
Three of four TS strains had mutations in NSP3. Notably, the mutations located within NSP3 in
strains L50-33 and L50-40 were identical, therefore the L445F and K1792R mutation in NSP3
were thought to account for the TS phenotype of these strains. It has been reported that NSP3
mutations in the MAC and PLP2 domains, cause temperature sensitivity in MHV (21). The
L445F mutation observed in L50-33 and L50-40 strains is located in the MAC2 domain and, the
V404F mutation in H50-11 strain is located very close to this domain of NSP3. These results
suggested that these three strains acquired the TS phenotype by a mechanism similar to TS
MHV. However, the mutations contributing to the TS phenotype in the A50-18 strain were still
unknown.
To identify the mutations involved in temperature sensitivity in the TS strains, we sought to
evaluate revertant strains of these viruses. By passaging the TS strains at 37°C, we obtained
several revertants from L50-33 and L50-40 strains, but only one from A50-18 strain
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Sequencing results of the latter strain confirmed that the G248V
mutation in NSP14 had changed to the wild type sequence, while the other mutations remained
(Fig. 2A). In the revertants from L50-33 and L50-40, NSP3 L445F mutation located in the MAC
domain mutated either back to leucine as expected, or to cysteine, another amino acid with no
aromatic ring (Fig. 2B). To better understand the role of the mutations in NSP14 associated with
the TS phenotype of A50-18, we generated a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 with the NSP14
sequence of the TS strain by reverse genetics. Vero cells infected with the recombinant virus
were cultured at 32°C and 37°C and the development of CPE was monitored. Wild type SARSCoV-2 and a recombinant virus with A50-18 envelope, used as control, caused CPE at both 32°C
and 37°C. However, the recombinant virus with the A50-18 strain’s NSP14 did not cause CPE at
37°C (Fig. 2C). These results strongly suggested that the mutations in NSP14 were involved in
the temperature sensitivity of A50-18.
Evaluation of pathogenicity

40

Temperature sensitive viruses are usually attenuated and have been used as live attenuated
vaccines, e.g. measles, rubella and influenza vaccines (15, 18-20). Here, we evaluated the
pathogenicity of the TS mutant strain A50-18, which showed impaired replication at 37°C, using
Syrian hamsters, widely used as a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection (22, 23). Viral
pathogenicity was monitored by body weight change after virus infection. An approximate body

weight decrease of 10% or 20% was observed 7 dpi in Syrian hamsters infected with low or high
doses of the B-1 virus, respectively (Fig. 3A). In contrast, no body weight loss was observed
after infection with the A50-18 strain, even at the high dose.

We investigated acute symptoms resulting from the infection with the TS strain. For that
purpose, B-1 or A50-18-infected Syrian hamsters were euthanized 3 dpi, and damage in the lung
tissue was evaluated. The lungs of B-1-infected hamsters were larger than those of A50-18infected ones (Fig. 3B, Supplemental Fig. 2). Additionally, apparent bleeding and destruction of
alveoli in the lungs of B-1-infected hamsters were detected, but no evident critical tissue damage
was observed in those of A50-18-infected hamsters. We also confirmed the amount of virus
remaining in the nasal cavity and lungs 3 dpi. The virus titer in nasal wash specimens of B-1and A50-18-infected hamsters was not significantly different, ranges being 4.50 × 102 ~ 5.40 ×
104 PFU/mL and 6.60 × 102 ~ 2.60 × 104 PFU/mL, respectively. On the other hand, A50-18
strain-infected hamsters showed 103 times lower virus titer than the B-1-infected group (Fig.
3C), the virus titer in lung tissue was 7.00 × 105 ~ 4.86 × 106 PFU/g and 2.00 × 102 ~ 5.07 × 103
PFU/g in B-1- and A50-18-infected hamsters, respectively. These results suggested that the A5018 strain showed an attenuated phenotype because its replication in lungs was impaired.
Evaluation of antigenicity

20

25

It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces immunity and prevents reinfection (22).
Thus, we sought to evaluate whether the attenuated A50-18 strain could be used as a live vaccine
to protect against wild type viral infection. Syrian hamsters were inoculated intranasally with the
B-1 virus or the attenuated A50-18 strain and reinfected with the wild type B-1 virus 21 d after
the first infection (Fig. 4A). Vaccine efficacy was assessed by body weight change. Primary B-1
strain infection resulted in a noticeable body weight loss in naïve hamsters, but no significant
weight decrease was observed in the hamsters pre-infected with B-1 or A50-18 (Fig. 4B),
suggesting the induction of protective immunity. The titer of neutralizing antibodies in the serum
of mock-infected hamsters was <20 (Fig. 4C). Infection with B-1 or A50-18 strains induced
neutralizing antibodies, titers being 640–5120 or 160–640, respectively. Neutralizing antibodies
induced by the attenuated A50-18 strain infection were sufficient to prevent viral reinfection in
Syrian hamsters.

Discussion

40

In this study, we isolated new TS SARS-CoV-2 strains. These strains showed various levels of
temperature sensitivity at 37°C. The H50-11 strain replicated slower than the wild type B-1
virus, while L50-33 and L50-40 strains barely replicated at 37°C. These strains presented
missense mutations in NSP3 MAC2 and Y domains. It was reported that mutations in NSP3
MAC or PLP domains can cause temperature sensitivity in MHV, likely by enhancing
proteasome-mediated degradation (21). Therefore, these strains probably obtained the TS
phenotype by a mechanism similar to the previously reported MHV TS mutants.
In contrast, A50-18 strain replication was not observed at 37°C for 5 d, although it replicated
similarly to the B-1 wild type virus at 32°C and 34°C. We revealed that the NSP14 protein of
A50-18, which presented three mutations that have not yet been reported, contributed to the
temperature sensitivity of the strain. It is known that NSP14 has exo-ribonuclease and N7
methyltransferase domains and is involved in viral genome replication by forming a complex

with other NSPs (24). The G248V mutation observed in the A50-18 strain is located near the
catalytic residue D243, that confers the exo-ribonuclease activity (25). The G416S mutation is
located near motif IV of the methyltransferase domain (26). These mutations probably involve
temperature-dependent enzymatic activity or temperature-dependent structural differences in
NSP14 that affect its ability to form a complex with other NSPs. Since the G248V mutation was
the only one that back mutated in the revertant strain, it is likely that it is critically involved in
this phenotype, although the significance of the other mutations, alone or in combination, still
needs to be clarified.
S. H. Seo et al. previously reported a cold-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain as a vaccine candidate.
(27) The replication of the cold-adapted strain was reduced at 37°C but still clearly evident, as it
was observed for the H50-11 strain described in the current study. In contrast, the A50-18 strain
showed a sharp TS phenotype of impaired replication at 37°C. In vivo experiments demonstrated
that this strain did not replicate efficiently in the lungs, evidenced by the lack of lung tissue
damage or weight decrease in hamsters infected with this strain, making it a safer candidate for a
live attenuated vaccine. The measles virus AIK-C strain and influenza virus Ann Arbor/1/60 and
Ann Arbor/1/66 strains, which are live attenuated vaccine strains approved for clinical use,
showed replication under 33°C or 35°C culture conditions, but not at 37°C (15, 18-20). The A5018 strain presents a TS phenotype similar to live attenuated vaccines already in use in clinical
settings.
Live attenuated vaccines can generate concerns regarding their safety, since the risks of reverting
to a pathogenic form and adverse reactions remains (28). However, since they can induce an
effective and long-lasting immune response that is nearly as good as the one induced by the wild
type virus, they have been used since the 1780’s, with Jenner’s smallpox vaccine (29). For the
influenza virus, it was previously reported that an attenuated TS reassortant virus induced IgA
secretion in the nasal cavity (30) with neutralizing activity, providing protection against infection
(31). Additionally, a live attenuated influenza virus vaccine could induce specific CD8+ T cell
immunity (32). Like the influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be transmitted through the
nasal cavity where epithelial cells express high levels of the receptor ACE2 (33). In addition, it
was reported that dimeric IgA in mucosal secretions showed an enhanced neutralizing activity
against SARS-CoV-2 (34). A50-18 replicated in the nasal cavity and the upper respiratory tract,
which exhibit a temperature lower than the lower respiratory tract and lungs. Therefore, intranasal inoculation with a TS SARS-CoV-2 strain may also induce the production of IgA and
specific T cells in this compartment. However, neurological manifestations in COVID-19 have
been the focus of great concern (35), and the intra-nasal administration of live attenuated SARSCoV-2 strains could trigger the development of taste and olfactory disorders, already reported to
be related to this virus (36). The accurate evaluation of these manifestations should be more
thoroughly tested in non-human primate models.
In this study we report the isolation of a new SARS-CoV-2 TS strain (A50-18) that showed
lower pathogenicity than the wild type strain and induced sufficient protective immunity.
Overall, this novel TS strain should be promising as a live attenuated vaccine against SARSCoV-2.

The growth kinetics of four TS (temperature-sensitive) mutants at different temperatures is
shown, compared to the WT (B-1) virus. Vero cells were infected with 1 × 104 TCID50 SARSCoV-2 strains (approximate MOI = 0.01) and incubated at the indicated temperatures. The virus
titer of the supernatant was evaluated by TCID50. Symbols represent the average of three
independent experiments, and error bars mean SD.

(A, B) Details of the amino acid sequence in segments of NSP14 (A) and NSP3 (B) of revertant
viruses (from A50-18, L50-33 and L50-40) are shown. Differences with the B-1 virus are
highlighted. (C) Development of CPE by infection with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 viruses,
containing the NSP14 or envelope genes of the A50-18 strain (r-NSP14A50-18, r-EnvA50-18,
respectively). Reconstituted viruses were added to Vero cells and incubated at 32°C (left
column). Subsequently, these supernatants were transferred to new Vero cells, and cultured at
32°C or 37°C (middle and right columns, respectively). CPE was confirmed by crystal violet
staining.
