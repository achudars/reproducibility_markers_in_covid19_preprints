Summary
COVID-19 is associated to a wide range of extra-respiratory complications, of which the pathogenesis is
currently not fully understood. In this study we report the temporal kinetics of viral RNA and inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines in serum during the course of COVID-19. We show that a RNAemia occurs more
frequently and lasts longer in patients that develop critical disease compared to patients that develop
moderate or severe disease. Furthermore we show that concentrations of IL-10 and MCP-1—but not IL6—are associated with viral load in serum. However, higher levels of IL-6 were associated with the
development of critical disease. The direct association of inflammatory cytokines with viral load or disease
severity highlights the complexity of systemic inflammatory response and the role of systemic viral spread.

Brief report
COVID-19 has been associated with a wide range of extra-respiratory complications, including neurologic,
cardiac, and thromboembolic complications. The pathogenesis of these extra-respiratory complications is
not fully understood but several mechanisms are thought to contribute, including the systemic spread of
SARS-CoV-2 and systemic inflammatory cytokines (Gupta et al., 2020). Even though SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA
and inflammatory cytokines have been detected in the blood, their kinetics during infection are poorly
understood and it is unclear if either RNAemia or inflammatory cytokines are associated with each other
or with other disease parameters. We hypothesize that RNAemia occurs frequently during severe COVID19 and that it contributes to the systemic cytokine responses. Therefore we aimed to get insight in the
kinetics of SARS CoV-2 RNAemia and the associated systemic inflammatory response.
Diagnostic specimen of twenty patients (16 male, 4 female), hospitalized at the Erasmus MC in the
Netherlands in March and April 2020, were analyzed. Ten patients developed moderate or severe disease
(grouped together) and 10 critical disease, according to NIH disease severity guidelines
(https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/overview/management-of-covid-19). One or more
underlying diseases were present in 19 patients which included cardiovascular diseases (11), diabetes (9),
previous cerebro-vascular accident (4), previous respiratory disease (3), cancer (3), solid organ
transplantation (2), kidney failure (1), psychosis (1) or sarcoidosis (1). None of the patients received
dexamesthasone during the course of disease. Further patient characteristics are included in
Supplemental Table 1. A total of 176 serum samples were analyzed and a paired RT ([naso]pharyngeal
swab or sputum) was available for 131 specimens (Table S2).
Viral RNA was measured by qPCR for the E gene in all serum and RT samples as described previously
(Corman et al., 2020). RNAemia was detected in 50% and 90% of the patients with respectively
moderate/severe or critical disease. The duration of the RNAemia per patient could not be determined,
since samples early after disease onset were not available for all patients, but RNAemia was more
frequently detected from 11 days post disease onset (dpd) in patients who developed critical disease (OR
4.65 CI 1.05-20.64; p = 0.038; Figure 1A, Table S2), as was calculated using generalized estimated

equations, corrected for repeated samples within patients. Furthermore, independent of disease severity,
RNAemia was associated with a ct value <30 in paired RT samples (OR 9.47, CI 3.08-29.07; p=0.009) and <
11 dpd (OR 4.61, CI 1.80-11.87; p=0.001; figure 1B). In this study there was no correlation between
RNAemia and age (OR 1.0, CI 0.99-1.01; p=0.31) or BMI (OR1.0, CI 0.9-1.2; p=0.58). Virus could not be
isolated from serum samples, but since these had been collected for molecular and serological
diagnostics, the sample handling and storage was most likely suboptimal for virus culture. In addition, we
have previously shown that virus is difficult to culture from samples with an ct value of 27 (van Kampen
J.J.A, 2020).
Next, we used a 13-plex cytometric bead assay to determine kinetics of the inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IP-10, IFNγ, TNFα, MCP-1 and TGFβ in serum
of patients up to 21 dpd (Fig S1). All tested cytokines were significantly upregulated during the course of
infection, with the exception of IL-4, IL-12p70 and TGFβ, which were therefore excluded from further
analysis. IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17A, IP-10, MCP-1 and TNFα were induced during the course
of disease (Figure 1C), although large differences were observed among individual patients. Overall, a
dynamic response was observed in the majority of patients (Figure S1). Generalized estimated equations,
corrected for repeated sampling within patients, were used to determine associations of individual
cytokines with RNAemia, a ct RT <30, disease severity and outcome, and period after disease onset. Of all
cytokines and chemokines only IFNγ was associated with a disease period of ≤10 days in both uni- and
multivariate analysis (Table, Figure 1C).
First, we determined which cytokines or chemokines were associated with the viral load in serum or RT
sample. A RNAemia was associated with increased levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IP-10 and MCP-1 in a
univariate analysis. Subsequent multivariate analyses, adjusting for the ct value in the RT, showed that Il10 and MCP-1 were independently associated with RNAemia (Table, Figure S2A). In a univariate analysis,
ct value <30 in the RT was associated with increased serum levels of IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IP10 and MCP-1 compared to a ct value >31 in the RT, and with increased levels of IFNγ and IL-1β in a
multivariate analysis (Table, Figure S2B).

Next, we determined which cytokines or chemokines were associated with the development of critical
disease and death as outcome. Patients that developed critical disease had significantly higher levels of
IL-1β and IL-6 compared to patients that developed moderate or severe disease (Table, Figure S3A). Death
as an outcome was not associated with elevated levels of any of the cytokine included in this study in the
multivariate analyses (Table, Figure S3B).
Altogether, this study shows the presence of RNAemia in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The overall
detection of RNAemia in 70% of patients included in this study is higher than in most other reports (Hogan
et al., 2020, Fajnzylber et al., 2020). This is likely due to the fact that all patients included in this study
were hospitalized with moderate, severe or critical disease and the fact that we analyzed samples
throughout the course of disease. The fact that a RNAemia is detected at later time points post disease
onset in patients that develop critical disease, together with the detection of SARS- CoV-2 in extrarespiratory tissues (Gupta et al., 2020), suggests the systemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 contributes to the
pathogenesis of severe COVID-19.
The role of systemic cytokines during the course of COVID-19 is only partly understood. In line with
previous studies we show that higher levels of IL-6 are associated with the development of more severe
disease (Del Valle et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2020). However, IL-6 is not directly associated with viral load
in either serum or the respiratory tract in our study, which suggest that IL-6 production is not directly
triggered by virus replication. In contrast, IL-10, MCP-1, IL-1β and IFNγ were associated with either viral
RNA in serum or RT suggesting that these were triggered—either directly or indirectly—by virus
replication. This suggests that the systemic cytokine response is complex, but is at least in part directly
associated with virus within the respiratory tract or circulation. The multifaceted mechanism of systemic
responses during the course of disease and the exact role of these systemic responses in the pathogenesis
of COVID-19 requires further characterization.
Even though this study has several limitations, such as the number of patients, the retrospective character
and the usage of diagnostic samples, it reveals important insight on the temporal kinetics of both RNAemia
and associated systemic cytokine responses. Our findings suggest that both RNAemia and systemic

responses contribute—at least in part—to the systemic pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, which fits with
the wide spectrum of extra-respiratory complications associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, we show
that in order to acquire more insights into the systemic pathogenesis, it is essential to analyse the kinetics
of systemic viral load and responses during the course of disease. This knowledge will be essential for the
development and timing of intervention strategies that target either the host immune response or virus
replication

Materials and methods:
Patient specimen and data collection
Diagnostic respiratory and serum samples of COVID-19 patients admitted to Erasmus are sent to the unit
of clinical virology, Viroscience department, Erasmus MC. In 20 patients admitted in March and April
2020, we performed qPCRs on serum samples collected for diagnostic purposes during admission, as
previously described (ref van Kampen Nat Comm). Other available diagnostic results (serology, virus
culture and qPCR on respiratory tract specimen) were extracted from our diagnostic laboratory
information management system. In addition, following information was extracted from the electronic
patient files: date of onset of symptoms, disease severity (hospitalized on ICU with mechanical
ventilation, hospitalized on ICU with oxygen therapy, hospitalized to ward with oxygen therapy,
hospitalized to ward without oxygen therapy), whether the patients were still alive or not when they
were discharged.

Medical ethical approval
All patient specimen and data used in this study were collected in the context of routine clinical patient
care. Additional analyses were performed only on surplus of patient material collected in the context of
routine clinical patient care. Our institutional review board approved the use of these data and samples
(METC-2015-306). METC-2015-306 is a generic protocol to study viral diseases. Informed consent was
waived by the privacy knowledge office of the Erasmus MC.

Cytometric bead assay
Systemic cytokines were quantified in all patients’ sera up to 21 dpd. Sera were analysed in duplo using
the 13-plex Human essential immune Legendplex panel (Biolegend). A standard cytokine cocktail was
taken along in duplo to allow for quantification of the cytokine concentrations. The cytometric bead

assay was performed on a FACSLyric (BD) and the data were analysed using the Legendplex data analysis
software.

Analyses
Statistical analysis was performed using R version 4.0.3 and the geepack package. Associations between
presence of RNAemia and a Ct <30 in respiratory samples and a dpd <11 were determined after
dichotomizing the values and evaluating the fit according to the quasi-likelihood under the
independence criterion (QIC) by generalized estimating equations corrected for multiple samples per
patient. Associations between individual cytokines and RNAemia, a ct <30 in respiratory samples, critical
disease and a fatal outcome were assessed using generalized estimating equations corrected for
multiple samples per patient. Associations of cytokines with a p-value of <0.1 were subjected to a
multivariate analysis.
