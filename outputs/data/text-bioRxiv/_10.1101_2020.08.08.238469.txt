ABSTRACT

53

Without an effective prophylactic solution, infections from SARS-CoV-2 continue to rise

54

worldwide with devastating health and economic costs. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells

55

via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin converting

56

enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disruption of this interaction confers potent neutralization of viral entry,

57

providing an avenue for vaccine design and for therapeutic antibodies. Here, we develop single-

58

domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2

59

Spike and ACE2. By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody

60

sequences, we identified a panel of nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on Spike and

61

block ACE2 interaction via two distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM)

62

revealed that one exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive

63

conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-

64

state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of

65

multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2

66

Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains stability and

67

function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment. These properties may enable

68

aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia, promising to

69

yield a widely deployable, patient-friendly prophylactic and/or early infection therapeutic agent to

70

stem the worst pandemic in a century.

MAIN TEXT:

73

Over the last two decades, three zoonotic β-coronaviruses have entered the human population,

74

causing severe respiratory symptoms with high mortality (1-3). The ongoing COVID-19

75

pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2, the most readily transmissible of these three

76

coronaviruses (4-7). SARS-CoV-2 has wrecked the world’s economy and societies to an

77

unprecedented extent, to date (Aug. 14, 2020) causing 751,154

78

reported deaths around the globe (8). Although public health measures have slowed its spread

79

in many regions, infection hotspots keep reemerging. No successful vaccine or preventive

80

treatment has yet been manufactured for any coronavirus, and the time to develop an effective

81

and broadly available vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 remains uncertain. The development of novel

82

therapeutic and prophylactic approaches thus remains essential, both as temporary stopgaps

83

until an effective vaccine is generated and as permanent solutions for those segments of the

84

population for which vaccination proves ineffective or contraindicated.

85
86

Coronavirus virions are bounded by a membrane envelope that contains ~25 copies of the

87

homotrimeric transmembrane spike glycoprotein (Spike) responsible for virus entry into the host

88

cell (9). The surface-exposed portion of Spike is composed of two domains, S1 and S2 (10). The

89

S1 domain mediates the interaction between virus and its host cell receptor, the angiotensin

90

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), while the S2 domain catalyzes fusion of the viral and host cell

91

membranes (3, 11-13). During its biogenesis, the Spike protein is proteolytically cleaved

92

between the S1 and S2 domains, which primes the virus for cellular entry (10). Contained within

93

S1 is the receptor binding domain (RBD), which directly binds to ACE2. The RBD is attached to

94

the body of Spike by a flexible region and can exist in an inaccessible down-state or an

95

accessible up-state (14, 15). Binding to ACE2 requires the RBD in the up-state and enables

96

cleavage by host proteases TMPRSS2 or cathepsin, triggering a dramatic conformational

97

change in S2 that enables viral entry (16). In SARS-CoV-2 virions, Spike oscillates between an

98

active, open conformation with at least one RBD in the up-state and an inactive, closed

99

conformation with all RBDs in the down-state (9, 11, 14, 15).

100
101

By screening a high-complexity yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobodies, we

102

have uncovered a collection of nanobodies that block the Spike-ACE2 interaction. Biochemical

103

and structural studies revealed that two classes of these nanobodies act in distinct ways to

104

prevent ACE2 binding. Combining affinity maturation and structure-guided multimerization, we

105

optimized these agents and generated Spike binders that match or exceed the potency of most

106

monoclonal antibodies disclosed to date. Our lead neutralizing molecule, mNb6-tri, blocks

107

SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells at picomolar efficacy and withstands aerosolization,

108

lyophilization, and elevated temperatures. mNb6-tri provides a promising approach to deliver a

109

potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing molecule directly to the airways for prophylaxis or therapy.

RESULTS

112

Synthetic nanobodies that disrupt Spike-ACE2 interaction

113

To isolate nanobodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, we screened a yeast surface-displayed

114

library of >2x109 synthetic nanobody sequences. Our strategy was to screen for binders to the

115

full Spike protein ectodomain, in order to capture not only those nanobodies that would compete

116

by binding to the ACE2-binding site on the RBD directly but also those that might bind

117

elsewhere on Spike and block ACE2 interaction through indirect mechanisms. We used a

118

mutant form of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Spike*,) as the antigen (15). Spike* lacks one of the two

119

activating proteolytic cleavage sites between the S1 and S2 domains and introduces two

120

mutations to stabilize the pre-fusion conformation. Spike* expressed in mammalian cells binds

121

ACE2 with a KD = 44 nM (Supplementary Fig. 1), consistent with previous reports (17). Next, we

122

labeled Spike* with biotin or with fluorescent dyes and selected nanobody-displaying yeast over

123

multiple rounds, first by magnetic bead binding and then by fluorescence-activated cell sorting

124

(Fig. 1A).

125
126

Three rounds of selection yielded 21 unique nanobodies that bound Spike* and showed

127

decreased Spike* binding in the presence of ACE2. Closer inspection of their binding properties

128

revealed that these nanobodies fall into two distinct classes. One group (Class I) binds the RBD

129

and competes with ACE2 (Fig. 1B). A prototypical example of this class is nanobody Nb6, which

130

binds to Spike* and to RBD alone with a KD of 210 nM and 41 nM, respectively (Fig. 1C; Table

131

1). Another group (Class II), exemplified by nanobody Nb3, binds to Spike* (KD = 61 nM), but

132

displays no binding to RBD alone (Fig. 1C, Table 1). In the presence of excess ACE2, binding of

133

Nb6 and other Class I nanobodies is blocked entirely, whereas binding of Nb3 and other Class II

134

nanobodies is decreased only moderately (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that Class I

135

nanobodies target the RBD to block ACE2 binding, whereas Class II nanobodies target other

136

epitopes and decrease ACE2 interaction with Spike allosterically or through steric interference.

137

Indeed, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments demonstrate that Class I and Class II

138

nanobodies can bind Spike* simultaneously (Fig. 1D).

140

Analysis of the kinetic rate constants for Class I nanobodies revealed a consistently greater

141

association rate constant (ka) for nanobody binding to the isolated RBD than to full-length Spike*

142

(Table 1), which suggests that RBD accessibility influences the KD. We next tested the efficacy

143

of our nanobodies, both Class I and Class II, to inhibit binding of fluorescently labeled Spike* to

144

ACE2-expressing HEK293 cells (Table 1, Fig. 1E). Class I nanobodies emerged with highly

145

variable activity in this assay with Nb6 and Nb11 as two of the most potent clones with IC50

146

values of 370 and 540 nM, respectively (Table 1). For unexplained reasons, Class II nanobodies

147

showed little to no activity in this assay (Table 1, Fig. 1E).

148
149

Going forward, we prioritized two Class I nanobodies, Nb6 and Nb11, that combine potent

150

Spike* binding with relatively small differences in ka between binding to Spike* or RBD. We

151

reasoned that the epitopes recognized by Nb6 and Nb11 would be more readily accessible in

152

the Spike protein on intact virions. For Class II nanobodies we prioritized Nb3 because of its

153

optimal stability and yield during purification.

154
155

Nb6 and Nb11 target the RBD and directly compete with ACE2

156

To define the binding sites of Nb6 and Nb11, we determined their cryogenic electron

157

microscopy (cryo-EM) structures bound to Spike* (Fig. 2A-B, Supplementary Fig. 2-4,

158

Supplementary Table 1). Both nanobodies recognize RBD epitopes that overlap the ACE2

159

binding site (Fig. 2E). For Nb6 and Nb11, we resolved nanobody binding to both the open and

160

closed conformations of Spike*. We obtained a 3.0 Å map of Nb6 bound to closed Spike*, which

161

enabled modeling of the Nb6-Spike* complex (Fig. 2A), including the complementarity

162

determining regions (CDRs). We also obtained lower resolution maps for Nb6 bound to open

163

Spike* (3.8 Å), Nb11 bound to open Spike* (4.2 Å), and Nb11 bound to closed Spike* (3.7 Å).

164

For these lower resolution maps, we could define the nanobody’s binding orientation but not

165

accurately model the CDRs.

166
167

Nb6 bound to closed Spike* straddles the interface between two adjacent RBDs. The majority of

168

the contacting surfaces are contributed by CDR1 and CDR2 of Nb6 (Fig. 2C). CDR3 contacts

169

the adjacent RBD that is counterclockwise positioned when viewed from the top of Spike* (Fig.

170

2C). The binding of one Nb6 therefore stabilizes two adjacent RBDs in the down-state. We

171

surmise that this initial binding event pre-organizes the binding site for a second and third Nb6

172

molecule to stabilize the closed Spike* conformation. Indeed, binding of two Nb6 molecules

173

would lock all three RBDs into the down-state, thus highly favoring binding of a third Nb6

174

because binding would not entail any further entropic cost. By contrast, Nb11 bound to down-

175

state RBDs only contacts a single RBD (Fig. 2D).

176
177

Nb3 interacts with the Spike S1 domain external to the RBD

178

Our attempts to determine the binding site of Nb3 by cryo-EM proved unsuccessful. We

179

therefore turned to radiolytic hydroxyl radical footprinting to determine potential binding sites for

180

Nb3. Spike*, either apo or bound to Nb3, was exposed to 5-50 milliseconds of synchrotron X-ray

181

radiation to label solvent-exposed amino acids with hydroxyl radicals. Radical-labeled amino

182

acids were subsequently identified and quantified by mass spectrometry of trypsin/Lys-C or Glu-

183

C protease digested Spike*(18). Two neighboring surface residues on the S1 domain of Spike

184

(M177 and H207) emerged as highly protected sites in the presence of Nb3 (Supplementary

185

Fig. 5). The degree of protection is consistent with prior observations of antibody-antigen

186

interactions by hydroxyl radical footprinting (19). Both M177 and H207 are greater than 40 Å

187

distant from the ACE2 binding site on the RBD, suggesting that Nb3 may inhibit Spike-ACE2

188

interactions through allosteric means.

189
190

Rationally engineered multivalency increases potency

191

The structure of Nb6 bound to closed Spike* enabled us to engineer bivalent and trivalent

192

nanobodies predicted to lock all RBDs in the down-state. To this end, we inserted flexible Gly-

193

Ser linkers of either 15 or 20 amino acids to span the 52 Å distance between adjacent Nb6

194

monomers bound to down-state RBDs in closed Spike* (Supplementary Fig. 6). Both linker

195

lengths are too short to span the distance (72 Å) between Nb6 bound to a down-state RBD and

196

an up-state RBD that would co-exist in an open Spike. Moreover, binding of three RBDs in the

197

previously reported conformation of Nb6-bound open Spike* would be physically impossible

198

even with longer linker length because of steric clashes (Supplementary Fig. 6). By contrast, the

199

minimum distance between adjacent Nb11 monomers bound to either open or closed Spike* is

200

68 Å (Supplementary Fig. 6). We therefore predicted that multivalent binding by Nb6 constructs

201

would display significantly slowed dissociation rates due to the enhanced avidity afforded by

202

Spike’s trimeric architecture.

203
204

We assessed multivalent Nb6 binding to Spike* by SPR. Both bivalent Nb6 with a 15 amino acid

205

linker (Nb6-bi) and trivalent Nb6 with two 20 amino acid linkers (Nb6-tri) dissociate from Spike*

206

in a biphasic manner. The dissociation phase can be fitted to two components: a fast phase with

207

kinetic rate constants kd1 of 2.7x10-2 s-1 for Nb6-bi and 2.9x10-2 s-1 for Nb6-tri, which are of the

6

208

same magnitude as that observed for monovalent Nb6 (kd = 5.6x10-2 s-1) and a slow phase that

209

is dependent on avidity (kd2 = 3.1x10-4 for Nb6-bi and kd2 < 1.0x10-6 s-1 for Nb6-tri, respectively)

210

(Fig. 3A). The relatively similar kd for the fast phase suggests that a fraction of the observed

211

binding for the multivalent constructs is nanobody binding to a single Spike* RBD. By contrast,

212

the slow dissociation phase of Nb6-bi and Nb6-tri indicates engagement of two or three RBDs.

213

We observed no dissociation for the slow phase of Nb6-tri over 10 minutes, indicating an upper

214

boundary for kd2 of 1x10-6 s-1 and subpicomolar affinity. This measurement remains an upper-

215

bound estimate rather than an accurate measurement because the technique is limited by the

216

intrinsic dissociation rate of Spike* from the chip imposed by the chemistry used to immobilize

217

Spike*.

218
219

We reasoned that the biphasic dissociation behavior could be explained by a slow

220

interconversion between up- and down-state RBDs, with conversion to the more stable down-

221

state required for full trivalent binding. According to this view, a single domain of Nb6-tri

222

engaged with an up-state RBD would dissociate rapidly. The system would then re-equilibrate

223

as the RBD flips into the down-state, eventually allowing Nb6-tri to trap all RBDs in closed

224

Spike*. To test this notion directly, we varied the time allowed for Nb6-tri binding to Spike*.

225

Indeed, we observed an exponential decrease in the percent fast-phase with a t1/2 of 65 s (Fig.

226

3B), which, we surmise, reflects the timescale of conversion between the RBD up- and down-

227

states in Spike*. Taken together, dimerization and trimerization of Nb6 afforded 750-fold and

228

>200,000-fold gains in KD, respectively.

229
230

Class I and II nanobodies prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection

231

We next tested the neutralization activity of trivalent versions of our top Class I (Nb6 and Nb11)

232

and Class II (Nb3) nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus. In this assay,

233

SARS-CoV-2 Spike is expressed as a surface protein on a lentiviral particle that contains a

234

ZsGreen reporter gene, which is integrated and expressed upon successful viral entry into cells

235

harboring the ACE2 receptor (20). Nb6 and Nb11 inhibited pseudovirus infection with IC50

236

values of 2.0 µM and 2.4 µM, respectively, and Nb3 inhibited pseudovirus infection with an IC50

237

of 3.9 µM (Fig. 3C, Table 1). Nb6-tri shows a 2000-fold enhancement of inhibitory activity, with

238

an IC50 of 1.2 nM, whereas trimerization of Nb11 and Nb3 resulted in more modest gains of 40-

239

and 10-fold (51 nM and 400 nM), respectively (Fig. 3C).

241

We next confirmed these neutralization activities with a viral plaque assay using live SARS-

242

CoV-2 virus infection of VeroE6 cells. Consistent with its activity against pseudotyped lentivirus,

243

Nb6-tri proved exceptionally potent, neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 with an average IC50 of 160 pM

244

(Fig. 3D). Nb3-tri neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with an average IC50 of 140 nM (Fig. 3D).

245
246

Affinity maturation yields a femtomolar KD Spike inhibitor

247

We further optimized the potency of Nb6 by selecting high-affinity variants. To this end, we

248

prepared a new library, starting with the Nb6 coding sequence, in which we varied each amino

249

acid position of all three CDRs by saturation mutagenesis (Fig. 4A). After two rounds of

250

magnetic bead-based selection, we isolated a population of high-affinity clones. Sequencing

251

revealed two highly penetrant mutations: I27Y in CDR1 and P105Y in CDR3. We incorporated

252

these two mutations into Nb6 to generate matured Nb6 (mNb6), which binds with 500-fold

253

increased affinity to Spike* as measured by SPR (Fig. 4B). As a monomer, mNb6 inhibits both

254

pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2 infection with low nanomolar potency, a ~200-fold

255

improvement compared to Nb6 (Fig. 4I-J, Table 1).

256
257

A 2.9 Å cryo-EM structure of mNb6 bound to Spike* shows that, like the parent nanobody Nb6,

258

mNb6 binds to closed Spike (Fig. 4C, Supplementary Fig. 7). The higher resolution map allowed

259

us to build a model with high confidence and determine the effects of the I27Y and P105Y

260

substitutions. mNb6 induces a slight rearrangement of the down-state RBDs as compared to

261

both previously determined structures of apo-Spike* and Spike* bound to Nb6, inducing a 9°

262

rotation of the RBD away from the central three-fold symmetry axis (Fig. 4H) (14, 15). This

263

deviation likely arises from a different interaction between CDR3 and Spike*, which nudges the

264

RBDs into a new resting position. While the I27Y substitution optimizes local contacts between

265

CDR1 in its original binding site on the RBD, the P105Y substitution leads to a marked

266

rearrangement of CDR3 in mNb6 (Fig. 4F-G). This conformational change yields a different set

267

of contacts between mNb6 CDR3 and the adjacent RBD (Fig. 4D). Remarkably, an X-ray crystal

268

structure of mNb6 alone revealed dramatic conformational differences in CDR1 and CDR3

269

between free and Spike*-bound mNb6, suggestive of significant conformational heterogeneity

270

for the unbound nanobodies and induced-fit rearrangements upon binding to Spike* (Fig. 4E).

271
272

The binding orientation of mNb6 is similar to that of Nb6, supporting the notion that our

273

multivalent design would likewise enhance binding affinity. Unlike Nb6-tri, trivalent mNb6

274

dissociation over ten minutes, yielding an upper bound for the dissociation rate constant kd of

276

1.0x10-6 s-1 (t1/2 > 8 days) and a KD of <1 pM (Fig. 4B). As above, more precise measurements

277

of the dissociation rate are precluded by the surface chemistry used to immobilize Spike*.

mNb6-tri displays further gains in potency in both pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2 infection

280

assays with IC50 values of 120 pM (5.0 ng/mL) and 54 pM (2.3 ng/mL), respectively (Fig. 4H-I,

281

Table 1). Given the sub-picomolar affinity observed by SPR, it is likely that these viral

282

neutralization potencies reflect the lower limit of the assays. mNb6-tri is therefore an

283

exceptionally potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, among the most potent molecules

284

disclosed to date.

285
286

Nb6, Nb6-tri, mNb6, and mNb6-tri are robust proteins

287

One of the most attractive properties that distinguishes nanobodies from traditional monoclonal

288

antibodies is their extreme stability (21). We therefore tested Nb6, Nb6-tri, mNb6, and mNb6-tri

289

for stability regarding temperature, lyophilization, and aerosolization. Temperature denaturation

290

experiments using circular dichroism measurements to assess protein unfolding revealed

291

melting temperatures of 66.9, 62.0, 67.6, and 61.4 °C for Nb6, Nb6-tri, mNb6 and mNb6-tri,

292

respectively (Fig 5A). Aerosolization and prolonged heating of Nb6, mNb6, and mNb6-tri for 1

293

hour at 50°C induced no loss of activity (Fig 5B). Moreover, mNb6 and mNb6-tri were stable to

294

lyophilization and to aerosolization using a mesh nebulizer, showing no aggregation by size

295

exclusion chromatography and preserved high affinity binding to Spike* (Fig. 5C-D).

DISCUSSION

298

There is a pressing need for prophylactics and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

299

Most recent strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell aim at blocking the

300

ACE2-RBD interaction. High-affinity monoclonal antibodies, many identified from convalescent

301

patients, are leading the way as potential therapeutics (22-29). While highly effective in vitro,

302

these agents are expensive to produce by mammalian cell expression and need to be

303

intravenously administered by healthcare professionals (30). Moreover, large doses are likely to

304

be required for prophylactic viral neutralization, as only a small fraction of systemically

305

circulating antibodies cross the epithelial cell layers that line the airways (31). By contrast, single

306

domain antibodies (nanobodies) provide significant advantages in terms of production and

307

deliverability. They can be inexpensively produced at scale in bacteria (E. coli) or yeast (P.

308

pastoris). Furthermore, their inherent stability enables aerosolized delivery directly to the nasal

309

and lung epithelia by self-administered inhalation (32).

310
311

Monomeric mNb6 is among the most potent single domain antibodies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2

312

discovered to date. Multimerization of single domain antibodies has been shown to improve

313

target affinity by avidity (32, 33). In the case of Nb6 and mNb6, however, our design strategy

314

enabled a multimeric construct that simultaneously engages all three RBDs, yielding profound

315

gains in potency. Furthermore, because RBDs must be in the up-state to engage with ACE2,

316

conformational control of RBD accessibility can serve as an added neutralization mechanism.

317

Indeed, our Nb6-tri and mNb6-tri molecules were designed with this functionality in mind. Thus,

318

when mNb6-tri engages with Spike, it prevents ACE2 binding by both directly occluding the

319

binding site and by locking the RBDs into an inactive conformation. Although a multitude of

320

other monoclonal and single-domain antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Spike have been

321

discovered to date, there are few if any molecules as potent and stable as mNb6-tri (33-43).

322

Resistance to aerosolization, in particular, offers unprecedented opportunity for patient-friendly

323

nasal and pulmonary administration.

324
325

Our discovery of Class II neutralizing nanobodies demonstrates the presence of previously

326

unexplored mechanisms of blocking Spike binding to ACE2. For one Class II nanobody, Nb3,

327

we identified a likely binding site in the Spike S1 domain external to the RBDs. Previously

328

discovered neutralizing antibodies from convalescent patients bind an epitope in a similar region

329

of Spike (24, 26, 27). Binding of Nb3 to this epitope may allosterically stabilize RBDs in the

330

down-state, thereby decreasing ACE2 binding. Pairing of Class I and Class II nanobodies in a

331

prophylactic or therapeutic cocktail could thus be a highly advantageous strategy for both potent

332

neutralization and prevention of escape variants. The combined stability, potency, and diverse

333

epitope engagement of our anti-Spike nanobodies therefore provide a unique potential

334

prophylactic and therapeutic strategy to limit the continued toll of the COVID-19 pandemic.

586

Figure 1. Discovery of two distinct classes of anti-Spike nanobodies. A, Selection strategy

587

for identification of anti-Spike nanobodies that disrupt Spike-ACE2 interactions using magnetic

588

bead selections (MACS) or fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). B, Flow cytometry of

589

yeast displaying Nb6 (a Class I nanobody) or Nb3 (a Class II nanobody). Nb6 binds Spike*-

590

Alexa 647 and receptor binding domain (RBD-Alexa 647). Nb6 binding to Spike* is completely

591

disrupted by an excess (1.4 µM) of ACE2-Fc. Nb3 binds Spike*, but not the RBD. Nb3 binding

592

to Spike* is partially decreased by ACE2-Fc. C, SPR of Nb6 and Nb3 binding to either Spike* or

593

RBD. Red traces are raw data and global kinetic fits are shown in black. Nb3 shows no binding

594

to RBD. D, SPR experiments with immobilized Spike* show that Class I and Class II nanobodies

595

can bind Spike* simultaneously. By contrast, two Class I nanobodies or Class II nanobodies do

596

not bind simultaneously. E, Nanobody inhibition of 1 nM Spike*-Alexa 647 binding to ACE2

597

expressing HEK293T cells. n = 3 (ACE2, Nb3) or 5 (Nb6, Nb11) biological replicates. All error

598

bars represent s.e.m.

604

show receptor binding domain (RBD) up- or down-states. C, Nb6 straddles the interface of two

605

down-state RBDs, with CDR3 reaching over to an adjacent RBD. D, Nb11 binds a single RBD in

606

the down-state (displayed) or similarly in the up-state. No cross-RBD contacts are made by

607

Nb11 in either RBD up- or down-state. E, Comparison of RBD epitopes engaged by ACE2

608

(purple), Nb6 (red), or Nb11 (green). Both Nb11 and Nb6 directly compete with ACE2 binding.
