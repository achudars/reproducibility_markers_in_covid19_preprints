Abstract
During infection the SARS-CoV-2 virus fuses its viral envelope with cellular membranes of its human host. Initial contact with the host cell and membrane fusion are
both mediated by the viral spike (S) protein. Proteolytic cleavage of S at the S20 site
exposes its 40 amino acid long fusion peptide (FP). Binding of the FP to the host
membrane anchors the S2 domain of S in both the viral and the host membrane. The
reorganization of S2 then pulls the two membranes together. Here we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the two core functions of the SARS-CoV-2
FP: to attach quickly to cellular membranes and to form an anchor strong enough
to withstand the mechanical force during membrane fusion. In eight 10 µs-long MD
simulations of FP in proximity to endosomal and plasma membranes, we find that FP
binds spontaneously to the membranes and that binding proceeds predominantly by
insertion of two short amphipathic helices into the membrane interface. Connected via
a flexible linker, the two helices can bind the membrane independently, yet binding of
one promotes the binding of the other by tethering it close to the target membrane.
By simulating mechanical pulling forces acting on the C-terminus of the FP we then

show that the bound FP can bear forces up to 250 pN before detaching from the membrane. This detachment force is more than ten-fold higher than an estimate of the
force required to pull host and viral membranes together for fusion. We identify a fully
conserved disulfide bridge in the FP as a major factor for the high mechanical stability
of the FP membrane anchor. We conclude, first, that the sequential binding of two
short amphipathic helices allows the SARS-CoV-2 FP to insert quickly into the target
membrane, before the virion is swept away after shedding the S1 domain connecting
it to the host cell receptor. Second, we conclude that the double attachment and the
conserved disulfide bridge establish the strong anchoring required for subsequent membrane fusion. Multiple distinct membrane-anchoring elements ensure high avidity and
high mechanical strength of FP-membrane binding.

Introduction
During infection, viruses first recognize and then enter their target cells. Coronaviruses
such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, use their
trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein for both tasks. The spike S1 subunit recognizes the human
target cell by binding to the ACE2 receptor, and the S2 subunit then facilitates fusion of
the viral membrane with host cellular membranes. 1–3 To initiate fusion, in analogy to the
hemagglutinin (HA) fusion protein of influenza, the SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit is expected
to first form one long trimeric coiled coil. 4 This elongation would bring the fusion peptides
(one per monomer) into the proximity of the membrane of the target cell. Binding to this
membrane simultaneously anchors the S2 subunit in both the viral membrane (via its stalk)
and the host membrane (via the FP). When the S2 subunit subsequently collapses to form a
six-helix bundle in a proposed jack-knife mechanism, this pulls the host membrane and the
viral membrane into proximity for eventual fusion. 4–8
SARS-CoV-2 has two di↵erent routes of entry into the human host cell, either directly
by fusion with the plasma membrane or by endosomal escape. 2,3,9 In the latter pathway, the

SARS-CoV-2 virion is endocytosed by the host cell after binding to the ACE2 receptor. As
the membrane composition and pH of the endosome change, structural rearrangements may
be induced in the S protein that facilitate membrane fusion. The virus then escapes the
endosome before reaching the lysosome, releasing its RNA into the cytoplasm of the host. 9
The FP of SARS-CoV-2 spike was identified as the 40 amino-acid long sequence just Cterminal of the S20 -cleavage site. 2,10,11 Upon proteolytic cleavage, S sheds its S1 subunit and
releases the FP as the new N-terminus of its S2 subunit. 3,12,13 Despite the concerted e↵orts to
study the structure and flexibility of the S protein, 8,14–18 the structure of the FP after contact
with the membrane has so far remained elusive. Nonetheless, mutagenic studies and electron
spin resonance (ESR) experiments have provided some insight into the structure-function
relationship of the SARS-CoV-1 FP. Using ESR, Lai et al. observed that both ends of the
SARS-CoV-1 FP increased the order parameter of lipids that were spin labeled in their
membrane interface region. 19 N- and C-terminal fragments of the FP induced this e↵ect
individually; however, the intact FP showed the strongest e↵ect on lipid order. Notably, no
such ordering e↵ect was observed after mutating the LLF motif in the N-terminal region of
the FP to AAA. Mutation studies by Madu et al. confirmed the importance of the LLF
motif for the fusion activity of the FP. 10 Together, these experiments resulted in the idea
of a bipartite fusion platform, with the LLF motif close to the N-terminus playing a crucial
role. 19 The ability to increase the order parameter of spin labeled lipids was also confirmed
for the SARS-CoV-2 FP. 20
Given the lack of experimental structural data, we performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations (MD) to elucidate the binding modes of the SARS-CoV-2 FP to the di↵erent
host membranes it can encounter during infection. In a first set of simulations, we placed the
FP in proximity to membranes mimicking the endosome and the outer leaflet of the plasma
membrane, respectively. In this way, we could probe the spontaneous binding of the FP to
these membranes. In a second set of simulations, we studied the mechanical strength of the
FP membrane anchor. Starting with membrane-bound FP, we pulled the FP away from the

membrane until it detached. Theoretical results suggest that in all binding modes observed
here the FP anchoring is strong enough to support the complete fusion process. 21

Results
The FP in solution forms two short amphipathic helices
To explore the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 FP after S1 shedding and upon exposure to the
surrounding medium, we performed MD simulations in aqueous solution, starting from the
structure of the FP in intact S. Sequence and structural evidence suggests that the FPs of
human infectious coronaviruses contain one highly conserved N-terminal amphipathic helix
(NTH), a less conserved second amphipathic helix (AH2), and the C-terminal helix (CTH)
(Figure 1a, c). The NTH is folded in the prefusion cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2
S protein resolved by Cai et al. 8 During a 1 µs simulation of the FP in water, the two
C-terminal residues of the NTH (N824 and K825) quickly unfolded and the shorter NTH
stabilized (Figure 1a, b). Formed by consecutive residues, the LLF motif is spread across
both faces of the NTH, as the two leucines are part of the predicted hydrophobic face and
the phenylalanine is not. At the C-terminal end of the FP segment, the EM structure of S
shows three helical segments interrupted by short disordered regions. In our simulation of
FP in aqueous solution, the first segment expanded to the beginning of the second segment
to form a single contiguous helix (AH2), the remainder of the second segment unfolded, and
the third segment retained its helical structure. These two distinct short helices (AH2 and
CTH) are connected via a short loop. Whereas the amino-acid sequence of CTH is highly
conserved and shows no strong amphipathic properties, AH2 is less conserved but carries
a strong hydrophobic moment (Figure 1c). Notably, AH2 and the CTH are additionally
connected via a fully conserved disulfide-bridge.

NTH binds membranes with its amphipathic face
We reasoned that the two amphipathic helices NTH and AH2 may insert into the human
membranes to anchor the S protein for membrane fusion. To test this hypothesis, we performed MD simulations of FPs placed near lipid bilayers. In eight independent MD simulations of 10 µs each, we observed five spontaneous insertion events of the NTH into the
membrane interface. Four of these events occurred on the endosomal membrane, meaning
that all replica simulations with this composition ended with the NTH inserted (Table S1).
In three cases the NTH was the part of the peptide that first created a stable contact. Two
other spontaneous insertion events were mediated by membrane contacts of AH2 and CTH.
Notably, once the NTH bound to the membrane, it remained bound for the entire duration
of the simulations. Only in one of the eight simulations did the FP not stably insert into
the membrane.
In all three cases in which the NTH established the first stable contact, the binding followed a consistent path. First, F817 penetrated below the phosphate headgroup region of
the membrane, after which the rest of the NTH bound the membrane with its predicted hydrophobic face. NTH binding stabilized in two slightly di↵erent ways: In three simulations
(Figure 2; runs 1, 2, 4), F823 flipped its orientation after being bound to the endosomal
membrane for ⇡ 0.7, 2, and 3 µs, respectively, so that its aromatic sidechain became completely buried under the lipid headgroup region. This led to an overall deeper insertion of the
NTH, where all three residues of the LLF motif became deeply burrowed into the membrane.
We found that, once flipped, F823 can transition between a favored deep insertion state and
a shallow state (Figure S2). In the remaining insertion event into the endosomal membrane,
the NTH established stable binding without F823 flipping in the simulated time and hence
the helix remained on top of the membrane interface. In this shallower binding state, only
the residues of the predicted hydrophobic face of the NTH inserted into the headgroup region
(Figure 1c), as did the disordered region immediately downstream of the NTH (V826–A829).
In the simulations with the mimetic of the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, we

observed one spontaneous NTH binding event, after the CTH and AH2 had already been
inserted for more than 5 µs (Figure 3, run 4). All three helices stayed bound to the membrane
for ⇡ 0.5 µs until the NTH lost membrane contact. To relieve the lateral-pressure asymmetry
between the two leaflets caused by inserting a large structure into only the top leaflet of
a finite-size membrane patch, we selected this relatively short lived state with all three
helices bound, removed 5 lipid molecules of the over-compressed leaflet and restarted the
simulation. In this pressure-relieved mode, all three helices remained stably bound for the
entire simulated time (>3 µs, Figure S3a). F823 flipped into the membrane under the
phosphate headgroups after ⇡ 1.3 µs, which led to deeper NTH insertion.

The C-terminus of the FP binds via flexible elements
In all our simulations, we observed membrane binding also with the C-terminal end of the FP.
Binding involved AH2, the CTH and flexible elements flanking AH2 at both ends. In some
cases, these membrane interactions were relatively short lived (see, e.g., Figure 2, run 3), in
other cases binding was stable for more than 6 µs. Interestingly, some stable interactions were
mediated by only few but tight interactions (see e.g., Figure 3, run 2), whereas other more
extensive interactions were short-lived. The short hydrophobic stretches that inserted most
frequently are centered around residues I834, L841 and I844. As these residues are located
at the borders of the AH2 and the CTH, their binding repeatedly led to the insertion also of
residues of the respective neighboring helix. This coupled insertion was especially common
in the case of AH2, which, by this process, was guided into the membrane interface with its
predicted hydrophobic face. Notably however, the short AH2 and to an even larger extent
the CTH, in some cases partially unfolded to flexible amphipathic structures when bound
to the membranes (Figure S4).

The inserted NTH can withstand high pulling forces
We determined the strength of the membrane anchoring by subjecting the the C-terminus
of the FP to mechanical force. This process mimics the forces experienced by the FP during
its presumed primary function of pulling host and viral membrane into proximity. In our
simulations, we applied force to the C-terminus of the FP in a direction normal to the
membrane. By pulling the C-terminal end up via a harmonic spring moving at constant
velocity, the force applied to the peptide increases more or less linearly in time, until peptide
segments, and ultimately the entire peptide, are pulled out of the membrane. Each of these
events results in a distinct drop in force. By pulling the bound NTH out of the endosomal
membrane, we found that the binding of the NTH alone can withstand pulling forces between
40 and 65 pN. As shown in Figures 4b and c, the applied force increased as long as the
peptide was still in contact with the membrane. When the peptide lost its last contact with
the membrane, it detached in a sudden transition. Higher forces were needed to pull the
NTH out of the deeply bound state with inserted F823 (Figure 4b, right). Interestingly, even
though F823 was pulled out of the membrane along this path (Figure 4c, II), the shallow
state did not appear as a distinct intermediate in the pulling traces. Nonetheless, the forces
required to completely detach the NTH from the deep state are 10-15 pN higher compared
to the shallow binding mode.

Additional insertion of AH2 and CTH dramatically stabilize membrane anchoring
We performed additional pulling simulations with the full length FP, starting from a binding
mode with all three helices inserted into the membrane interface. The initial structure for
the 20 replica pulling simulations was taken from an unbiased simulation of FP on the outer
plasma membrane (for details see methods). Having all three helices inserted increased the
mechanical stability of the FP membrane anchoring. With rupture forces ranging from 130

to 254 pN, these simulations reveal that binding of the full FP is about two to three times as
strong as binding of the NTH alone (Figure 4d, dashed lines and dots). Additional pulling
simulations of structures of the same simulation at di↵erent times show similarly high rupture
forces (Figure S3b).
For the full-length FP, the force-extension curves also changed in character compared
to the NTH alone (Figures 4b and d). We consistently observed multiple distinct rupture
peaks. The first two of these peaks were observed in all 20 replicas. The events resulting
in the two force peaks are connected to each other because the force does not drop back to
zero in-between them. One might assume that these peaks were the result of the CTH and
AH2 detaching individually. However, visual inspection revealed that this is not the case.
Instead, the first peak corresponds to the extraction of the neutral F855 terminus. In most
cases, this is closely associated with the detachment of Y837 and L841 of the AH2 from
the membrane, after which AH2 stands upright. This causes a sudden gain in flexibility of
the C-terminus that results in a local minimum (above 4 nm) in the force-extension curve
(Figure 4d and e, Movie S5). However, at this point, I844 in the short loop between the AH2
and the CTH still remains inserted in all simulations. The detachment of I844 then results
in the second rupture peak. In 35% of the simulations the entire peptide was detached from
the membrane after the second force peak, meaning that all three helices detached nearly
simultaneously with the detachment of I844. In the remaining 65% of pulls, parts of the
long linker and the NTH stayed bound independently of the AH2 and the CTH and only
detached later. This then resulted in a series of additional force peaks, with rupture forces
in the same regime as for the isolated NTH fragment.

Discussion
Two separate binding regions increase the likelihood to stay bound
under load
Due to the connection via a long disordered linker, the NTH and the two more C-terminal
helices, AH2 and CTH, act relatively independent from one another. Nonetheless, binding
of one part to the membrane automatically places the other part close to the membrane as
well, thus making it easier for it to bind. Therefore, their binding behaves cooperative while
at the same time unbinding of one part does not necessarily lead to rapid dissociation of the
FP away from the membrane. Hence, we hypothesize that the architecture of the FP results
in a fast k on -rate, thanks to the small amphipathic insertion elements, and a slow k o↵ -rate
thanks to multiple interaction elements and their geometric arrangement. For SARS-CoV-2,
the concept of avidity – with multiple spread-out interactions maintaining a bound state –
has emerged at multiple levels: in the ACE2-S interaction, 24 in the virion-host interaction, 14
and here in the FP-membrane interaction.
A particularly interesting force-bearing element in the FP is the disulfide bridge connecting the centers of AH2 and the CTH. In the lead-up to membrane fusion and thus viral
infection, we expect force to act on the C-terminus of the FP, as in our MD simulations.
By directing this force to the center of a membrane-anchored AH2 via the covalent disulfide
bridge, instead of applying it to the C-terminus of the helix, AH2 has to be pulled out of the
membrane all at once instead of lifting it from the end. With this in mind, it is therefore
not surprising the two cysteines are fully conserved in the betacoronavirus family (Figure
S1). In this way, AH2 can be kept small in footprint for rapid insertion yet sustain strong
binding also under significant force.
The behavior we observed is in perfect accordance with the bipartite fusion platform idea
as proposed by Lai et al. 19 They measured that both ends of the FP of SARS-CoV-1 could
individually increase the membrane order; however, when covalently bound they observed

the strongest e↵ect. This underlines our idea of the two sides of the FP acting cooperatively,
promoting each other’s membrane binding and stabilizing the anchoring overall. In addition,
we can directly link the described crucial role of the LLF motif to our observed NTH binding
as it consistently includes the insertion of both leucines (L821 and L822) into the glycerol
backbone region of the membrane lipids. Remarkably, we found that F823, despite being
placed on the hydrophilic face of the amphipathic helix, flipped its orientation so that its
sidechain became membrane inserted in the deeply bound state of the NTH. As we showed,
the deep binding state associated with F823 insertion increases the pulling force that the
NTH can withstand, which in turn supports the fusion activity of the FP.
Two other MD simulation studies recently addressed membrane binding by the FP. 25,26
Gorgun et al. used a truncated version of the FP where they cut it behind L841, right where
we observe the AH2. In a series of 30 short (300 ns) simulations, they observed binding of the
FP to a highly mobile membrane mimetic (HMMM) membrane model. They identified three
binding modes: one with the loop inserted into the membrane, one with the NTH inserted
and a last binding mode where the whole FP acquires helical structure and inserts on top
of the membrane. 25 The first two of these binding modes stand in good agreement with our
observations. However, it is worth noting that in the case of the long loop binding, we often
only observe shallow insertion of the involved residues. Our comparably long trajectories
additionally reveal that those loop insertions may play a role in guiding the larger helical
parts into the membrane, but do not remain stably bound on their own. The third binding
mode reported by Gorgun et al. 25 was not observed in our simulations. Nevertheless, this
does not mean that it may not realistically occur also with the full-length FP, if simulated
longer. The second study, by Khelashvili et al., 26 focuses on the role of Ca2+ -ions for FP
binding. In a large set of 1 µs long simulations, they also identified the NTH and the AH2
as predominantly helical and confirm the binding of the NTH region to the membrane as
the most prevalent binding mode in their Ca2+ coordinated structures. 26

Di↵erences in lipid density may alter preferred binding mode
The binding modes we described seem to loosely group into the NTH binding to the endosomal membrane and C-terminal regions binding to the outer plasma membrane mimetic. The
most pronounced di↵erence between the two membranes is their density and in particular
the density in the lipid headgroup region. The outer plasma membrane has a higher content
of cholesterol and sphingolipids, which pack tightly together, thus increasing the overall lipid
density. Adding to this, the outer plasma membrane contains relatively fewer lipids with
small headgroups, which would lower the pressure in the interface region. Specifically, in the
endosomal membrane, the two abundant lipids POPE and BMP decrease the density in this
area. Therefore, it is not surprising that the stably folded NTH can relatively easily insert
into the endosomal membrane, but only does so rarely with the outer plasma membrane. By
contrast, the high density of the outer plasma membrane may favor the insertion of smaller,
often disordered hydrophobic stretches such as the ones around I844. It is therefore tempting
to speculate that the observed di↵erences in insertion behavior may indeed be representative
of the initial binding of FPs into the comparably soft and compressible endosomal membrane
and the rigid and dense plasma membrane, both of which have been reported to be targeted
by SARS-CoV-2. 2,3,9

Finite size e↵ects may impair binding of the whole FP
In MD simulations of membrane systems, the spontaneous binding of a peptide into the
membrane is artificially hindered. Binding to only one leaflet of a small membrane patch
inevitably increases the lateral pressure in that leaflet and creates a significant asymmetry
in the packing of lipids in the two leaflets. This creates an artificial energetic penalty that
competes with the binding free energy of the amphipathic peptide. Unfortunately, this effect is difficult to correct for, short of performing simulations with prohibitively large boxes
or with preemptively removed lipids from one leaflet. Therefore, we expect that in our
simulation setup binding is weakened. We speculate that we would have seen more and

longer-lived binding modes to membranes with asymmetric leaflet density. Furthermore, the
lower penalty from the lateral pressure would have likely led to the simultaneous binding of
two or all three helices. This is underlined by the fact that in the initial, symmetric simulations the binding of all three helices together is only transiently stable, whereas relieving the
pressure in the bound leaflet makes the same binding mode stable for much longer. However,
taken together with the fact that, despite the energetic penalty, this state occurred at all,
we hypothesize that it may represent the energetically most favorable binding mode of the
FP.

Binding of few FPs may be strong enough to facilitate membrane
fusion
Kozlov and Chernomordik made a theoretical estimate of the forces acting on an influenza
HA FP during the fusion process. 21 During fusion, the HA2 subunit folds back onto itself
and creates a six helix bundle. 4–6 They estimated that the energy released from this folding
would give rise to ⇡ 8 pN of pulling force acting on each of the three FPs of HA. For
SARS-CoV-2, the fusion process is thought to be similar to that mediated by HA, and we
therefore expect that the forces are also comparable. 4 The 130-250 pN forces required to
detach the bound FP in our simulations greatly exceed the ones necessary according to these
theoretical considerations. Here we emphasize that the time scale of 100 ns to 1 µs over which
the force is ramped up in the simulations is in a range not unreasonable for the spike refolding
from prefusion to postfusion conformations. Even if at a lower force loading rate dissociation
happened already at a somewhat lower force, that force would still likely exceed substantially
the force required for fusion. 21 Whereas already the bound NTH alone can sustain such
forces, the full FP is anchored even more strongly by its three helices. As discussed, the
fully conserved cysteine-bridge emerged as an important mechanical stabilizer. The disulfide
bond connects the AH2 and the CTH at their centers, and thus directs the pulling force
away from the ends of the AH2. Instead of a sequential detachment of single amino acids,

each event with a comparably low energetic barrier, the application of force to the center of
the helix favors a pathway with a high barrier in which the entire hydrophobic face of the
AH2 is detached at once, before then I844 is pulled out normal to the membrane (Figure
4e). The structure with a disulfide bridge thus endows the FP with high anchoring strength
that is reminiscent of the catch bonds giving cell-cell contacts high mechanostability. 27
The observed stability of the binding raises the question of how many bound FPs are
required to be engaged for successful fusion. With all three of its helices bound, the full
estimated pulling force could be borne by just one FP. 21 This may ultimately increase the
infection success of the virus, as it would reduce one source of failure.

Conclusions
From atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we gained a detailed view of the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 FP with lipid bilayers mimicking the endosomal membrane
and the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. In our MD simulations, we observed multiple
spontaneous membrane insertion events. In all four runs with the more flexible and less
packed endosomal membrane, the FP eventually bound into the lipid bilayer with its NTH.
Adhered to membranes, the FP retained much of the secondary structure seen in pre-fusion
spike. The FP folds such that two short amphipathic helices can bind to the membrane interface with well defined hydrophobic faces. Additional highly flexible hydrophobic stretches
can prime the membrane insertion process and stabilize the bound state. The NTH and the
two C-terminal helices AH2 and CTH are separated by a flexible linker and can therefore
insert independently. Insertion of one, however, likely promotes the insertion of the other,
simply by disallowing escape away from the membrane. Insertion of all three helices at
the same time was observed rarely in our simulations. Nonetheless, we could show that by
relieving lateral pressure in the exposed leaflet, we could stabilize a binding mode with all
three helices inserted fully. We therefore expect that FP binding will eventually converge to

all three helices bound to the membrane in the course of a real infection event.
We could show that the bound FP — even though it is bound only to the interface of
the membrane — can withstand large pulling forces exceeding 200 pN. In fact, the forces are
so high that binding of only one of the three FPs of S may suffice for membrane fusion. 21
The strong anchoring force hints at a connection of the architecture of the FP and the infection success of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Cys-Cys disulfide bond linking the centers of
AH2 and CTH emerged as an important stabilizer. By transmitting the force load during
the membrane fusion process to the center of the membrane anchored AH2 instead of its
C-terminus, AH2 has to be pulled out of the membrane all at once to detach the FP from
the membrane. We speculate that by spreading the membrane interaction across multiple
distinct elements, with NTH, AH2, CTH and the intervening amphipathic loops all connecting to the membrane, the virus achieves a trade-o↵ between rapid insertion of individually
small elements into the membrane and their firm membrane anchoring.
The design principles for the SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptide emerging from our MD simulations could be relevant, on the one hand, for the design of fusion inhibitors and, on the
other hand, for the biotechnological development of membrane anchors and fusogens, e.g.,
for drug delivery applications.

Materials and Methods
General simulation parameters
All MD simulations were performed with Gromacs 2018.8 28 using the TIP3P water model
and the CHARMM36m forcefield. 29

FP in water
The FP was extracted from the S protein prefusion cryo-EM structure (PDB ID: 6XR8)
and used as the input for the CHARMM-GUI solution builder. 8,30 Its C-terminal end was

modeled as a methylamidated C-terminus, to account for the continuation of the peptides.
The disulfide-bridge between Cys840 and Cys851 was added. The peptide was solvated with
TIP3P water and 0.15 M NaCl.
Energy minimization was done using a steepest descent algorithm for 5000 steps with
restraints as described in table S4. Subsequently, the system was equilibrated for 125 ps, with
a timestep of 1 fs and Nosé-Hoover temperature coupling 31,32 with a reference temperature
of 310.15K and the same restraints as used during the minimization.
Finally, 1 µs of production simulation was performed. For this, the timestep was increased
to 2 fs and temperature coupling was handled by the velocity-rescale algorithm 33 coupled to
the protein and the rest of the system individually. Isotropic pressure coupling was handled
by the Parrinello-Rahman algorithm with compressibility Kxyz = 4.5 ⇥ 10

Amphipathic helix prediction
To analyze the physicochemical properties of the FP and in particular its amphipathic helices
we used the HeliQuest web-server. 23 Due to how short the AH2 and the CTH are, 1-2
neighboring residues were included on both sides of the observed helices.

Membrane compositions
To get insight into both membranes the FP can come into contact with in a realistic infection case, we built systems with two di↵erent membrane models. One is a recreation of
the the outer leaflet plasma membrane used by Lorent et al. 35 and is characterized by a
high amount of cholesterol and sphingolipids. These two types of lipids are known to pack
tightly together creating a relatively sti↵ membrane. Moreover, this membrane has a high
phosphatidylcholine (PC) and a low phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) content.
The second, the endosomal membrane model, was built based on results reviewed by van
Meer et al. 36,37 Notably, this membrane includes the late endosome specific lipid BMP and
lipids with small, negatively charged headgroups.

The detailed membrane compositions are summarized in tables S2 and S3.

Membrane simulations
The unbiased simulations of the fusion peptide on the di↵erent membranes were set up using
CHARMM-GUI membrane builder, 30,38 with TIP3P water and 0.15 M NaCl. In both cases
the FP was placed in close proximity to the membrane interface, but not bound to it (shortest
atom-atom distance ⇡ 5 Å). The membranes for the plasma membrane and the endosomal
membrane systems were built symmetrically with 150 and 160 lipids per leaflet respectively.
All simulations were minimized for 5000 steps using steepest descent and restraints as described by table S5. Subsequently, both systems were equilibrated in six equilibration steps
with decreasing restraints (table S5). During equilibration, the temperature coupling was
handled by the Berendsen thermostat 39 with a reference temperature of 310.15 K. Additionally, semiisotropic Berendsen pressure coupling 39 with reference pressure of 1 bar and
compressibility Kz = Kxy = 4.5 ⇥ 10

was applied for all but the first two equi-

libration rounds. After equilibration, the production runs were started without restraints.
For the production simulations, temperature coupling was handled by the velocity rescale
algorithm 33 coupled to the water together with the ions, the peptide and the membrane
individually with a coupling constant of one picosecond. Semiisotropic pressure coupling
was handled by the Parrinello-Rahman algorithm 34 with a reference pressure of 1 bar and
compressibility Kz = Kxy = 4.5 ⇥ 10

bar 1 . Pressure coupling was applied every 5 ps. To

create independent replicas, all four production runs of both systems were initialized with
di↵erent random velocities generated according to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

Constant velocity pulling
For constant velocity pulling of the NTH, two structures from one of the endosomal membrane simulations (run 1) were used as starting structures — one at 2.5 µs and the other
at 3.5 µs. To be able to isolate the strength of the NTH binding from e↵ects caused by

the rest of the FP, the peptides were then shortened to T827 and the new C-terminal end
was again methylamidated. In addition, the box size was increased in the z-direction to
18.2 nm. To do so, all water molecules and ions were removed after increasing the box size,
and the systems were re-solvated and re-ionized with 0.15M NaCl. Subsequently, the solvent was equilibrated for 1 ns, while heavily restraining the peptide and the lipid positions
(same restraints as for 1st equilibration; table S5). Replica simulations were started from
the same initial structure but with randomized initial velocities generated according to the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.
The same approach was used for pulling the FP with all three helices bound o↵ the membrane. There, the structure of the plasma membrane simulation run 4 at 5.7 µs (structure
in figure 3, bottom) was used. In contrast to the NTH pulling simulations, the peptide was
not shortened and the box size had to be increased in z-direction to 35 nm. In addition, the
lateral pressure of the bound leaflet was relieved by removing 5 lipids from it (2 cholesterol,
1 PLPC, 1 PSM, 1 NSM). Binding modes for simulated pulling were taken at 0, 1, 2, and
3 µs of an unbiased simulation with said system.
For the simulations, the Gromacs 2018.8 pull code 28 was used to move the C-terminal
carbon atom, away from the membrane center of mass at a constant velocity of 0.03 m s-1 .
A spring with a weak force constant of 10 kJ mol-1 nm-2 was chosen to connect the dummy
and the C-terminal carbon. The pulling force was only applied in the z-direction and the
simulations ended, when the distance between the center of mass of the membrane and the
C-terminal carbon was more than 0.49 times the box size in z.
