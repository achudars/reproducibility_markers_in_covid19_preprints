Abstract
Since COVID-19 outbreak, scientists have been interested to know whether there is
any impact of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine against COVID-19 mortality or not. It becomes more relevant as a large population in the world may have latent
tuberculosis infection (LTBI), for which a person may not have active tuberculosis but
persistent immune responses stimulated by Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, and
that means, both LTBI and BCG generate immunity against COVID- 19. In order to
understand the relationship between LTBI and COVID-19 mortality, this article proposes a measure of goodness of fit, viz., Goodness of Instrumental Variable Estimates
(GIVE) statistic, of a model obtained by Instrumental Variables estimation. The GIVE
helps in finding the appropriate choice of instruments, which provides a better fitted
model. In the course of study, the large sample properties of the GIVE statistic are
investigated. As indicated before, the COVID-19 data is analysed using the GIVE
statistic, and moreover, simulation studies are also conducted to show the usefulness
of the GIVE statistic.

Keywords: Instrumental variables, goodness of fit, multiple linear regression model, least
squares estimator, measurement errors, spherical disturbances, nonspherical disturbances,
coefficient of determination.

Introduction

There has been a significant interest since COVID-19 outbreak on whether well known tuberculosis (TB) vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and COVID-19 mortality are related
or not. Strictly speaking, the scientists are willing to know the effect of BCG vaccination
on the reduced mortality from COVID-19. Though as of now, there is no as such any scientific evidence in favouring the positive impact of BCG vaccination on the mortality due to
COVID-19 (see, e.g., Soliman et al. (2020)). However, most of the studies did not consider
the fact that many people in this world may have latent TB infection (LTBI), that means,
those people may not have evidence of clinically active TB but have Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens. Moreover, the fact is that LTBI creates lifelong immunity, and hence, may
provide an immunological protection against COVID-19. This article addresses the association between LTBI and the reduction of mortality due to COVID-19, and in the course
of this study, the Instrumental Variables (IV) estimation has played an important role in
the modelling of COVID-19 data to draw such conclusions, see Takahashi (2020). However,
the conclusions drawn in that article are restricted only to the estimation of parameters,
and there is no mention/evidence of goodness of fit, i.e., how good the model is fitted to
the COVID-19 data. In this context, we would like to mention that this article attempts to
propose and study the goodness of fit of the models obtained by IV estimation, which has
not yet been paid much attention in the literature.
We would now like to discuss in detail about how IV can be a powerful toolkit to
work on the aforesaid research problem related to COVID-19 outbreak. Note that one may
formulate a regression equation with the mortality due to COVID-19 as the response variable
and a few related covariates, which will be thoroughly discussed in Section 5. However, in
such regression models, it is likely to happen that the covariates become correlated with
the regression errors, and it makes the regression model a dubious regression model. In
order to overcome this problem, one may adopt the IV method since the IVs are highly
correlated with the covariates but uncorrelated with the error random variables, at least in
the limiting sense. An excellent exposition about the IV estimation is presented in Bowden

and Turkington (1984) and Wansbeek and Meijer (2000, Chap. 6).
Apart from the COVID-19 outbreak, in general also, the IV estimation in multiple linear
regression models has played a vital role in biostatistics. Bio-statisticians are pleased to use
it as IV can tame the confounding bias, without directly observing all explanatory variables.
Baiocchi (2014) has presented a tutorial on IV estimation in biostatistics. The IV estimation
has not only been used but extended in many directions. For example, Martinussen and
Vansteelandt (2020) used IV estimation in competing risk data, Tchetgen et al. (2015)
extended it to censored survival outcome, Li and Brookhart (2015) applied IV techniques
to the proportional hazards model, Dai (2014) presented a test for checking concordance
between instrumental variable effects, Tchetgen (2014) presented a method of instrumental
variable estimation when the outcome is rare, and many others (see also Burgess et al.
(2017), Didelez (2007), Uddin et al. (2015)).
As we indicated earlier in the context of the modelling mortality rate due to COVID-19
outbreak, the IV estimation in multiple linear regression model requires a set of IVs, which
are highly correlated with the explanatory variables, at least in limit and uncorrelated with
the disturbance term, at least in limit. Various sets of different IVs can be obtained for
the same set of data, which gives rise to different estimators of the regression coefficient
vector. This, in turn, produces different fitted models for the same set of given data. A
more complicated situation arises in multiple linear regression where there are more than
one explanatory variables. In such a case, the experimenter has various options to choose
the IVs for the explanatory variables, e.g., the same IVs for all the explanatory variables or
different IVs for different explanatory variables. Now, how to check which of the model is
better fitted to the given data or equivalently which choice of instrumental variable gives a
better fit in statistical sense is an issue. Many occasions, researchers and applied workers
provide various arguments to justify their choice of IVs but such justifications are based
on their experience and not based on any quantitative and scientific outcome of statistical
measures.
It is important to note that the goodness of fit in the classical multiple linear regression

model, based on OLSE, is defined for judging the goodness of fit of estimation, denoted
2
as R2 whereas for the purpose of prediction, it is denoted as Rprediction
. We now would

like to emphasize that the goodness of fit for judging the estimation and prediction of the
model are different. Strictly speaking, this article considers the aspect of goodness of fit of
estimation only while Pesaran and Smith (1994) mentioned that it is problematic to develop
the goodness of fit based on residuals, and for that reason, they considered the prediction
errors to develop the goodness of fit. We here successfully develop the goodness of fit based
on residuals, see also Windmeijer (1995), Bloom, Bond and Van Reenen (2007) in this regard.
Overall, this article investigates in the following direction. The coefficient of determination, popularly known as R-square (R2 ), is used to measure the goodness of fit in classical
multiple linear regression model and cannot be used or directly extended to the case of IV
models because the explanatory variable becomes stochastic and correlated with the disturbance term. To overcome this problem, we here propose a new goodness of fit statistic,
viz., Goodness of Instrumental Variable Estimates (GIVE) statistic, which can be used to
measure the goodness of fit in the IV models and to determine the optimal choice of IVs for
a given data. We here consider the development of GIVE statistics based on IV estimation
for a general situation when the error random variables are non-spherical, and their covariance matrix is unknown. The statistical properties such as the asymptotic distributions of
the GIVE statistic is also derived. Moreover, The performance of the GIVE statistic in a
finite sample is investigated with the Monte-Carlo simulation experiments in the context of
multiple linear regression model and measurement error model. Finally, the usefulness of
the GIVE statistic is established on the COVID-19 data addressing the association between
LTBI and the reduction of mortality due to COVID-19 as we discussed in the first two
paragraphs in this section.

Instrumental Variable (IV) Estimation

We first describe the model and IV estimation in the setup of a classical multiple linear
regression model, see Rao et al. (2007, Chapter 4). Consider the multiple linear regression

model with the study variable y linearly related to the p explanatory variables with an
intercept term in X as
y = Xβ + u.

(2.1)

Here y is the (n×1) vector of observations on study variable, X is the (n×(p+1)) matrix of n
observations on each of the p explanatory variables and an intercept term, β is the ((p+1)×1)
vector of regression coefficients associated with the (p + 1) explanatory variables, and u is
the (n × 1) vector of nonspherical disturbances with E(u) = 0 and unknown covariance
matrix, i.e., E(uu0 ) = σ 2 Ω−1 , where Ω is an unknown positive definite matrix, and σ > 0 is
a constant.
Note that in the usual linear regression model, it is assumed that X and u are uncorrelated but we here consider a situation where X and u are uncorrelated in limit, in the sense
that

assume the presence of intercept term in the model, which is needed for the validity of coefficient of determination in classical multiple linear regression model and may be needed for
the validity of the proposed goodness of fit statistic studied in Section 3. Next, suppose that
a set of p instrumental variables (denoted by (Z1 , . . . , Zp )) is available, and the observations
are arranged in a (n × (p + 1)) matrix with an intercept term in Z = (Z0 , Z1 , . . . , Zp ) such
that they are correlated with X, in limit and uncorrelated with u, in limit. Assume that

same only because of the notational and algebraic simplicities. The feasible generalized least
squares estimate of α is obtained by using generalized regression of X on Z and replacing Ω
by Ω̂ as
α̂IV Ω̂ = (Z 0 Ω̂Z)−1 Z 0 Ω̂X
from (2.3), where Ω̂ is a consistent estimator of unknown Ω. In the next stage, using the the
predicted value of X as
X̂Ω̂ = Z α̂IV Ω̂ = PZ Ω̂ X,
where PZ Ω̂ = Z(Z 0 Ω̂Z))−1 Z 0 in y = X̂Ω̂ β + u, we have
y = PZ Ω̂ Xβ + u.

Application of generalized least squares on (2.4) yields the two stage feasible generalized
least squares (2SFGLS) estimator of β as
β̂IV (Ω̂) = (X 0 PZ Ω̂ X)−1 X 0 PZ Ω̂ y.

(2.5)

Now, Theorem 1 asserts the consistency of β̂IV (Ω̂) to estimate the unknown parameter
β. Suppose that Ω̂ be a consistent estimator Ω, and the following assumptions are required

GIVE Statistic for Goodness of Fit in IV Model

Note that the coefficient of determination, popularly known as R2 , is the ratio of the sum of
squares due to regression (or the fitted model) and the total sum of squares obtained in the
context of analysis of variance in multiple linear regression model, see Rao et al. (2008, Chap.
3). It is measuring the proportion of variability explained by the fitted model with respect
to the total variability in the data based on the ordinary least squares estimator (OLSE).
The coefficient of determination fails to judge the goodness of fit in the IV models because
the total sum of squares can no longer be partitioned into two orthogonal components, viz.,
the sum of squares due to regression and the sum of squares due to error. Moreover, the IV
estimators do not possess the properties like the best linear unbiased estimator as possessed
by the OLSE, and hence, replacing OLSE by IV estimator in the definition of goodness of fit
statistics will not necessarily yield a good and reliable outcome. We here attempt to provide
a new statistic for quantitatively measuring the goodness of fit in the IV models, termed as
GIVE statistics.
The square of the population multiple correlation coefficient between y and fixed explanatory variable, say X ∗ is given by
θ=
0

where

X ∗ PI X ∗

p

→ ΣX∗ , where ΣX∗ is a positive definite finite matrix, PI = In − n1 en e0n , and

en = (1, 1, . . . , 1)0 is a (n × 1) vector of all elements unity. Note that when the model is best
fitted, then σ 2 = 0, and we have θ = 1. On the other hand, if the model is worst fitted,
then all the β’s will be zero indicating that all the explanatory variables are not effective,
and consequently, θ = 0. Any other value of θ lying between zero and one will accordingly
measure the goodness of the fitted model in terms of multiple correlation coefficient.
Now, recall the model (2.4), viz., y = PZ Ω̂ Xβ + u, where β is estimated by (2.5), and
we develop the goodness of fit statistic. The total sum of squares for model (2.4) is

It may be observed that in the classical multiple linear regression model, the total sum of
squares is partitioned into two orthogonal components- sum of squares due to regression and
sum of squares due to error. Observing the expression in (3.2), the first two terms, viz.,
β 0 X 0 PZ Ω̂ PI PZ Ω̂ Xβ and 2β 0 X 0 PZ Ω̂ PI u can be considered as jointly constituting the sum of
squares due to regression whereas u0 PI u can be considered as the sum of squares due to errors.
If we replace the unknown β and u in the first two terms of (3.2), viz., β 0 X 0 PZ Ω̂ PI PZ Ω̂ Xβ and
2β 0 X 0 PZ Ω̂ PI u by β̂IV (Ω̂) = (X 0 PZ Ω̂ X)−1 X 0 PZ Ω̂ y and ûΩ̂ = y − PZ Ω̂ X β̂IV (Ω̂), respectively,
then a measure of goodness of fit can be constructed by measuring the ratio of the sum of
squares due to regression and the total sum of squares under IV models as

β̂IV (Ω̂)0 X 0 PZ Ω̂ PI PZ Ω̂ X β̂IV (Ω̂) + 2β̂IV (Ω̂)0 X 0 PZ Ω̂ PI ûΩ̂

The statistic (3.3) can be used to measure the goodness of fit in the IV model having spherical disturbances with unknown covariance matrix and is termed as Goodness of
Instrumental Variable Estimates (GIVE) statistic in IV models. Theorem 2 states the consistency of G2IV (Ω̂) to its population counterpart θIV (Ω), where
θIV (Ω) =

β 0 ΣZXΩX β

The interpretation of θIV (Ω) is the same as θ in (3.1).
Theorem 2 Let Ω̂ be a consistent estimator of Ω under Euclidean norm. Then under (B1)

and (B2), G2IV (Ω̂) → θIV (Ω) as n → ∞.
Proof: See the supplementary material.

Remark: In case Ω is known, then Ω̂ can be replaced by known Ω. For example, substituting
Ω = σ 2 I will give the classical case.
In all-inclusive, G2IV (Ω̂) is a consistent estimator of θIV (Ω), where unknown Ω is estimated by its consistent estimator of Ω. The interpretations of G2IV (Ω̂) are similar to the

interpretations of coefficient of determination. When σ 2 = 0, then G2IV (Ω̂) = 1 indicates
that the model is the best fitted. On the other hand, if all estimated regression coefficients
are close to zero or say, exactly zero which indicates that all the regression coefficients are
not significant, i.e., the model is worst fitted, then G2IV (Ω̂) = 0. Beside these two values of
G2IV (Ω̂), any other value of G2IV (Ω̂) lying between 0 and 1 will indicate the degree of goodness of fit provided by the fitted model for given explanatory variables and sample size. For
example, if G2IV (Ω̂) = 0.75, it then would indicate that 75% of the variation in the response
values is being explained by the fitted IV model based on the choice of IVs and the fitted
IV model is nearly 75% good.

3.1

Asymptotic Distribution of GIVE statistic

We here derive the asymptotic distribution for the case when Ω is unknown, and the asymptotic distribution for the special cases, viz. known Ω and Ω = σ 2 I are stated in Corollary 1
and Lemma 1 (see the supplementary file), respectively.
We now assume the following conditions for the sake of technicalities:
(A1) The parameter space of β is compact.
(A2) X is a bounded random variable.
(A3) Z is a bounded random variable.
(A4) Z and u are independent random variables.
(A5) Z and  are independent random variables.
(A6) The correlation between  and u is non-zero.

Monte-Carlo Simulation Study

We conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation experiment for studying the performance of the
GIVE statistic for finite sample cases. To justify and understand the behaviour of GIVE
statistics based on the choice of instrumental variables, we consider Wald’s and Durbin’s
choices of instrumental variables, (see Rao et al. (2008, Chap. 4, pp. 208-209) for more
details). The Wald instrument technique divides the observations on explanatory variable
into two groups based on their median value and choose the IV as +1 and -1 for the two
groups, and Durbin instrument technique uses the ranks of observations on explanatory
variable as instruments. Here our modest aim is to understand the performance of the
proposed goodness of fit statistics. Hence to simplify and make the understanding better,

we consider a model with homoskedastic error structure with identity covariance matrix.
The same procedure can be extended to the case of a non-identity type covariance matrixknown or unknown both. In case of unknown non-identity covariance matrices, we also need
to choose a suitable consistent estimator to estimate the covariance matrix based on a sample
of data.
We conducted the simulation experiments using R software under two cases. First case
is the general set up of multiple linear regression models. In this case, our objective is to
demonstrate the application of GIVE statistics in a prominent model where IV is extensively
used. Keeping this in mind, we consider the measurement error models in the second case
and simulated the values of proposed GIVE statistics.

4.1

Application : Multiple Linear Regression Model

Here our simulation set up is as follows. For a given sample size n = 50, 100 and 200,
the random errors  are generated following N (0, σ 2 In ) with σ 2 = 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5 and 5
for the model (2.3) and (2.4) with p = 5 and 9 with high values of population multiple
correlation between the study variable and all the independent variables, and Ω is known.
The observations on X are generated from a normal distribution and corresponding IV’s
are found to construct Z using the Wald instrument technique, denoted as Z1 , and Durbin
instrument technique, denoted as Z2 . The GIVE statistics based on Z1 and Z2 are computed
and denoted as G2IV (Z1 ) and G2IV (Z2 ), respectively and their empirical relative bias and
empirical relative mean squared error are computed. A comparison of the GIVE statistic
with traditional R2 is made to know what happens to GIVE statistic when some important
and unimportant explanatory variables are added or when the intercept term is absent etc.
It may be recalled that the classical coefficient of determination (R2 ) has a property that it
increases as the number of explanatory variables in the model increases. The traditional R2
is defined only when there is an intercept term in the model. The detailed results along with
obtained values in different tables are presented in the supplementary material for the sake
of space. The conclusions drawn from those results are mentioned here.

We observe that as the value of variance σ 2 increases, the values of G2IV (Z1 ) and G2IV (Z2 )
decrease. All the results indicating that the choice of Z2 yields a better fitted model than Z1 .
Such an outcome is intuitively correct also because Z2 is using more information in terms of
ranks of the observations whereas Z1 is using the information on data as indicator variables
only. Hence, it can be concluded that if both Z1 and Z2 are used in X, then the proposed
GIVE statistics are capable of judging the goodness of fit which is affected primarily due
to the choice of IVs and thus deciding over the appropriateness of the choice of IVs. We
have used the same choice of IVs for all the variables but extending it to a case where
different explanatory variables are replaced by different IVs is not difficult. The resulting
GIVE statistics will reflect the goodness of fit appropriately.
Moreover, the empirical relative bias (RB) and empirical relative mean squared error
(RM) of G2IV (Z2 ) is smaller than that of G2IV (Z1 ) in all the settings of simulation set up.
The RB and RM of G2IV (Z1 ) and G2IV (Z2 ) increase as σ 2 increases for the given sample size.
As the sample size increases, the RB and RM of G2IV (Z1 ) and G2IV (Z2 ) decrease for a given
σ 2 . It is clear that the behavior resembles the behaviour of traditional R2 . The G2IV (Z1 )
and G2IV (Z2 ) are found to have a tendency to increase as the the number of explanatory
variables increase. This empirically confirms that the values of GIVE statistics increase when
explanatory variables are added in the model. Next, when relevant explanatory variables are
added, both G2IV (Z1 ) and G2IV (Z2 ) increase. The magnitude of increment is less than the
magnitude of increment of G2IV (Z1 ) and G2IV (Z2 ). This clearly indicates that the capability
of GIVE statistic in diagnosing whether the relevant or unimportant explanatory variables
are added in the model.
Furthermore, we find that the values of the GIVE statistic increase when the intercept
term is absent in the model in comparison to the values when the intercept term is present
in the model. There seems no issue that the GIVE statistics do not work in a model without
intercept. It is contrary to the traditional R2 which is defined only in a model with intercept
term. The RBs and RMs of G2IV (Z1 ) and G2IV (Z2 ) are lowered when the intercept term is
removed from the model. It will give slightly higher values in comparison when the intercept
term is present in the model.

Besides, the GIVE statistic works well only when σ 2 is small. It is intuitively expected
that as σ 2 increases, the model fitting should be worsened. The GIVE statistics are capturing
it better than R2 . Difference in the values of G2IV (Z1 ) and G2IV (Z2 ) for the same sets of
explanatory variables can be interpreted as the difference arising due to the choice of IVs.

Application : Measurement Error Model

We first briefly describe the set up of measurement error models. More details can be
found in Rao et al. (2008), Cheng and Van Ness (1999). Fuller (1987). Note that the
symbols and notations used in this subsection are limited to this subsection 4.2 only. The
reason to choose the measurement error model for application of GIVE statistics is that the
explanatory variable and random errors become correlated when the data is contaminated
with the measurement errors. Beside, among other estimation methods used in measurement
error models, the IV method is a popular method to obtain the consistent estimators of the
regression coefficient.
Note that a basic common assumption of any statistical analysis is that all the observations are correctly observed. However, in many practical situations, they cannot be correctly
observed due to various reasons; in fact, they are observed with some measurement error
into them. The difference between the observed and true values of the variable is termed
as measurement error. We here consider the structural form of the multiple measurement
error model where the true explanatory variables are stochastic with the same mean. Let
η = (η1 , η2 , . . . , ηn ) denote the (n × 1) vector of observations on the true values of study
variable and T = (t1 , t2 , . . . , tn )0 , ti = (ti1 , ti2 , . . . , tip )0 ; i = 1, 2, . . . , n be the n × p matrix of
the n observations on each of the p explanatory variables linked with
η = αen + T β,

(4.1)

where β = (β1 , β2 , . . . , βp )0 is a (p × 1) vector of regression coefficients associated with p
explanatory variables, α is the intercept term, and en = (1, 1, . . . , 1)0 is a (n × 1) vector of
elements unity. The true values η and T are not observable due to presence of measurement
errors but they are observed as y and X which are n×1 vector and n×p matrix, respectively

y = η+

X = T + ∆,

(4.3)

where  = (1 , 2 , . . . , n )0 ) is a (n×1) vector of measurement errors in η, ∆ = (δ1 , δ2 , . . . , δn )0 ,
and δi = (δi1 , δi2 , . . . , δip )0 ; i = 1, 2, . . . , n is n × p matrix of measurement errors involved
in T . We assume that δij (i = 1, 2, . . . , n, j = 1, 2, . . . , p) are independent and identically
distributed random variables following N (0, σδ2 ), and i , (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) are also independent
and identically distributed following N (0, σ2 ). Further,  and ∆ are also assumed to be
statistically independent of each other.
The data is generated from a population with high multiple correlation, and n = 50, 100
and 200 are chosen. The measurement errors  and δ are generated following N (0, σ2 In ) and
N (0, σδ2 In ), respectively with σ2 = 0.5, ση2 = 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5 and 5 for the model (4.1)-(4.3)
when p = 5 and 9. The observations on T are generated from a normal distribution in every
replication, and the corresponding IV’s are found to construct Z using the two approaches Wald Instrument Technique, denoted as Z1 , and Durbin Instrument Technique, denoted as
Z2 . The β is estimated using Z1 and Z2 with measurement error ridden data on X and y to
further compute the GIVE statistics. In this section, the GIVE statistics based on Z1 and
Z2 are denoted as G2IV (Z1 ) and G2IV (Z2 ), respectively. The results are summarized in the
supplementary material.
It is clear that the measurement errors in the data affect the values of G2IV (Z1 ) and
G2IV (Z2 ). As the value of variance σ2 increases, the values of G2IV (Z1 ) and G2IV (Z2 ) decrease.
The rate of such increment depends upon the sample size also. This again confirms that the
proposed GIVE statistics can satisfactorily measure the goodness of fit in the measurement
error models. The performance of GIVE statistics depends on a combination of n and σ2 .
Overall, it can be concluded that if there are several available choices of IVs, e.g., Z1 and
Z2 in the present case, then the proposed GIVE statistic helps in judging the appropriate
choice of IVs and gives an idea about the goodness of the fitted model.
Next, in terms of bias, it empirically indicates that G2IV (Z1 ) and G2IV (Z2 ) are negatively

biased. The magnitude of relative bias of G2IV (Z2 ) is smaller than the magnitude of relative
bias of G2IV (Z1 ) and RM (G2IV (Z2 )) < RM (G2IV (Z1 )) in all the settings of simulation set up.
If we take the sample size to be substantially large, then as the sample size increases, the
values of GIVE statistics will converge better towards θ. Moreover, we observe that the values
of G2IV (Z1 ) and G2IV (Z2 ) have a tendency to increase as the number of explanatory variables
increases just like the traditional R2 in the classical multiple linear regression model without
measurement errors. When unimportant explanatory variables are added in the model, then
G2IV (Z1 ) and G2IV (Z2 ), both increase but the amount of increment is less than the increment
that happened in G2IV (Z1 ) and G2IV (Z2 ). This confirm the capability of G2IV (Z1 ) and G2IV (Z2 )
in diagnosing whether the relevant or unimportant explanatory variables are added in the
model.
Hence, the proposed GIVE statistics works well in the measurement error model. We
expect that the GIVE statistics will also work well in other models also.

Analysis : COVID-19 Data Set

In Section 1, it has already been mentioned that there is likely to be an association between
well known tuberculosis (TB) vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and COVID-19 mortality. However, the scientists have not yet found any data analytic evidence of such a finding
(see, e.g., Soliman et al. (2020)). One possible reason for not finding any evidence of it is that
a large proportion of people in this universe may have latent TB infection (LTBI), i.e., they
may not have clinical evidence of active TB but have Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens.
Moreover, as said before, the LTBI may provide immunological protection against COVID19. We here try to address the association between LTBI and the reduction of mortality due
to COVID-19 using the IV technique based on GIVE statistic.
The data set consists of mortality rate due to COVID-19 of 104 countries from January
01, 2020 to May 30, 2020 (see https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus) along with
region (see https://www.who.int/countries/), bcgindex (see http://www.bcgatlas.org/),

pop65 (see https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.65) and lntb10 (see http:
//www.bcgatlas.org/). The whole data set is also submitted to the journal’s repository.
In this place, we would like to mention that the most of the countries with low income
levels (annual per capita income less than $825 USD) reported zero deaths attributed to
COVID-19 till May 30, 2020, and for this reason, specific 104 countries are selected for data
analysis, and the data with incomplete observations is not considered As indicated in Section 1, we here formulate a regression equation with the mortality due to COVID-19 as the
response variable and motivated by the study of Takahashi (2020), we consider the IVs for
the following three covariates :
bcgindex: The number of years a country has included BCG vaccine in its national immunization program. 1: All individuals received mandatory vaccinations; 0 : BCG neither
previously nor currently mandatory; Values between 0 and 1: BCG previously mandatory
but now discontinued. See Data Appendix for details of the construction of the BCG index.
The definition is taken from Takahashi (2020).
region: The World Health Organization (WHO) regional classification was used here. 1:
African Region; 2: South-East Asia Region; 3: East-Mediterranean Sea Region; 4: WesternPacific Asia Region; 5: Region of America; 6: European Region. The definition is taken
from Takahashi (2020).
pop65: The ratio of the population over 65 years of age. The definition is taken from
Takahashi (2020).
Another covariate is lntb10, which is defined as the number of TB infections per 100,000
people in logarithmic scale, i.e., this variable is approximately the same as the LTBI.
As Takahashi (2020) did, we here test the hypothesis if LTBI is associated with reduced
COVID-19 mortality and present the data analysis using IV estimation for the modelling
of COVID-19 data based on the aforesaid four covariates, where bcgindex, region and
pop65 are considered as IVs, and lntb10 is considered as original explanatory variable. We
extend it further and use two types of IVs to demonstrate how the GIVE statistic can help
in deciding the fitting of model and choice of IVs for a better fit. Here the IVs following

Wald’s (Z1 ) and Durbin’s (Z2 ) methods are generated for all the explanatory variables in
both the models. The following values of GIVE statistics are obtained:
For the multiple linear regression model with “bcgindex”, “region” as IVs, “lntb10”
as the original variable, and the mortality due to COVID-19 as the response variable, we
obtain the values of the GIVE statistics as G2IV (Z1 ) = 0.4743851 and G2IV (Z2 ) = 0.4540739.
Moreover, using the Z1 type IV, the estimate of the coefficient associated with “lntb10” is
−2.887569, and using the Z2 type IV, the estimate of the coefficient associated with “lntb10”
is −2.7774120. The negative sign of the coefficient of “lntb10” and the relatively large values
of G2IV (Z1 ) and G2IV (Z2 ) indicate that the LTBI may really protect against mortality due to
COVID-19.
Next, for the multiple linear regression model with “bcgindex”, “region” and “pop65”
as IVs, “lntb10” as the original variable, and the mortality due to COVID-19 as the response
variable, we obtain the values of the GIVE statistics as G2IV (Z1 ) = 0.4754459 and G2IV (Z2 ) =
0.4589668. Moreover, using the Z1 type IV, the estimate of the coefficient associated with
“lntb10” is −2.887569, and using the Z2 type IV, the estimate of the coefficient associated
with “lntb10” is −0.03867306. Again, the negative sign of the coefficient of “lntb10”,
and the larger values of G2IV (Z1 ) and G2IV (Z2 ) indicate that the LTBI may strongly protect
against COVID-19 mortality for the population with age more than 65.
Overall, it clearly indicates that the multiple linear regression fits the COVID-19 data
well, and the LTBI has really an impact on the reduction of mortality due to COVID-19; in
particular, for the elder people, who are 65 years old or more.

Recommendations for using GIVE statistics

Based on the results in subsections 4.1, 4.2 and Section 5, the following recommendations
are being made.
• The proposed GIVE statistics are capable of measuring the goodness of fitted models

in case the regression coefficients are estimated by IV estimation method.
• The proposed GIVE statistic works well in the models with as well as without an
intercept term.
• The performance of GIVE statistics depends upon the choice of IV, sample size and
variance of random errors.
• The proposed GIVE statistics are capable of judging the the appropriate choice of IVs
in order to have a better fitted model.
• The proposed GIVE statistics are capable of judging the variable selection, i.e., if the
explanatory variables added in the model are relevant or not.
• The values of GIVE statistics can be used in any biological, biostatistical or econometric
models, where IV is used.
• The use of GIVE statistic is not recommended when either the variance of random
errors (or variance of the measurement error) is large or sample size is too low.
• The GIVE statistic performs better when the variance of random errors (or the variance
of the measurement error) is not too large and/or sample size is reasonably large, but
it also depends upon the choice of IVs.
• The GIVE statistics can be used in any real data application.
