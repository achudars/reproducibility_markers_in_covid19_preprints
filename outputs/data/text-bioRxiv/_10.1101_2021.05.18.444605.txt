ABSTRACT: The purpose of this work was to provide an in silico molecular rationale of the
role eventually played by currently circulating S-RBDCoV-2 mutations in evading the immune
surveillance effects elicited by the two Eli Lilly LY-CoV555/bamlanivimab and LYCoV016/etesevimab monoclonal antibodies. The main findings from this study and shows that,
compared to the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, mutations E484A/G/K/Q/R/V,
Q493K/L/R, S494A/P/R, L452R and F490S are predicted to be markedly resistant to
neutralization by LY-CoV555, while mutations K417E/N/T, D420A/G/N, N460I/K/S/T,
T415P, and Y489C/S are predicted to confer LY-CoV016 escaping advantage to the viral

protein. A challenge of our global in silico results against the relevant experimental data
resulted in an overall 90% agreement. This achievement not only constitutes a further, robust
validation of our computer-based approach but also yields a molecular-based rationale for all
relative experimental findings, and leads us to conclude that the current circulating SARSCoV-2 and all possible emergent variants carrying these mutations in the spike protein can
present new challenges for mAb-based therapies and ultimately threaten the fully-protective
efficacy of currently available vaccines.

The 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) elicited by the novel severe acute respiratory
1, 2

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 157 million of confirmed
3

infections globally, and caused more than 3.3 million deaths so far. This pandemic has also
4

forced much of the world to enter an unprecedented sort of stand-by condition, with exceptional
life-threating situations and unparalleled damage to the global economy. The ability of science
and technology to deliver an effective, global solution to COVID-19 will be critical to restoring
some semblance of normalcy, and the scientific community has responded commendably to
this vital call. In particular, incomparable efforts have been and still are currently focused on
the development of effective measures to further limit the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 infection
and to treat already affected individuals. To date, drug development is under way; however, no
proven effective therapies for this virus currently exist, while drugs that target the dysregulated
5

cytokine responses (aka cytokine storms) characteristic of COVID-19 are available, although

their clinical benefit is still a matter of debate. Meanwhile, different mRNA- or virus-based
7

vaccines have received approval (and more are under clinical trial) and have so far provided
effective and efficient protection against the disease, making vaccination the key weapon in
8, 9

fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Another promising approach is the isolation of SARS-CoV2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).

10, 11

mAbs are immuno-therapeutics, which could

i) potentially deliver immediate benefit in COVID-19 treatment, ii) act as passive prophylaxis
until vaccines become globally available, and iii) serve as alternative therapeutic strategies in
those populations where vaccines have been found to be less protective.

11, 12

The recent findings

that ansuvimab (mAb114) is a safe and effective treatment for symptomatic infection with
Ebola virus is a notable example of the successful use of mAb therapy during an outbreak of
infectious disease.

13

Ab-based therapeutics directed against SARS-CoV-2 still present lights and shadows.

14

Preclinical data and phase-III clinical studies indicate that mAbs could be effectively deployed
for prevention or treatment during the viral symptoms phase of the disease. Cocktail
15

formulations of two or more mAbs are preferred over single Ab preparations because these
combinations may result in increased antiviral efficacy and viral escape prevention.

16-18

However, Ab cocktails are complicate formulations,

19, 20

and such approach likely involves

increased production costs and quantities at a time when the supply chain is being pressured
into meeting the high demand for COVID-19 therapeutics, vaccines, and therapeutic agents in
general.
The multi-domain SARS-CoV-2 surface spike (S) protein

21-23

- a trimeric class I fusion protein

that mediates viral entry - is the focus of the current Ab discovery efforts. The S protein is
composed of two subunits: S1, containing a receptor-binding domain (S-RBDCoV-2) that
recognizes and binds the human receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),

24-27

and

S2, which mediates viral cell membrane fusion by forming a six-helical bundle via the two-

heptad repeat domain. Viral entry is initiated by the upward shift of the spike RBD at the
protein's apex which, in turn, promotes ACE2 binding (Figure 1, top panels). In addition, viral
cell entry involves the S-protein priming operated by the cellular transmembrane serine
protease 2 (TMPRSS2), along with other proteases, the removal of subunit S1, and the
28

29

conformational reorganization of subunit S2; all these processes contribute to viral fusion with
the cell and transfers of genetic material following receptor involvement.

heads in light tan spheres), showing one protomer in the up position and in complex with the
LY-CoV555 (bamlanivimab) monoclonal antibody (light blue van der Waals surface).

Due to the critical nature of the viral S-RBDCoV-2 interaction with ACE2, Abs that bind this
domain and interfere with ACE2 attachment can have potent neutralizing activity.

30-37

An S-

RBDCoV-2 specific mAb (LY-CoV555 or bamlanivimab) was discovered that can bind the
RBD in both (up/active) (bottom panel in Figure 1) and (down/resting) conformations, and was
reported to display high in vitro and in vivo protection potency, thereby supporting its
development as a therapeutic for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. In the same
38

context, another mAb isolated from a COVID-19 convalescent patient – LY-CoV016 or
etesevimab – was soon after reported. This mAb also showed specific SARS-CoV-2
39

neutralization activity by recognizing another epitope on the S-RBDCoV-2, and was found
effective in vivo in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. These two mAbs from Eli Lilly
39

presently under clinical evaluation for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, both alone
and in cocktail formulations.

40-42

Contextually, in the United States the Food and Drug

Administration (FDA) has already granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of the
combined bamlanivimab/etesevimab cocktail as anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody
therapeutic for the treatment of COVID-19, while the European Medicine Agency (EMA) also
recently concluded that these two mAbs can be used together to treat confirmed COVID-19 in
patients who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at high risk of their COVID-19
disease becoming severe. EMA also analyzed the use of LY-CoV555 alone and concluded that,
despite uncertainties around the benefits of monotherapy, it could be considered a treatment
option.
However, viruses that encode their genome in RNA (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the Influenza A Virus (IAV)), are prone to acquire

mutations in time, mainly because of three factors. The first, and likely the most probable
source of mutations consists in copying errors as viruses replicate inside host cells.

43

Interestingly, however, this mechanism may be less relevant for SARS-CoV-2 with respect to
other RNA viruses, since coronavirus polymerases – i.e., those enzymes the play vital role in
viral genome replication and transcription – are endowed with a proofreading mechanism that
corrects potentially fatal mistakes. Viral genomic variability may also originate from the
44

recombination of two viral lineages coinfecting the same host. As a third factor, mutations can
45

be induced by the host cell RNA-editing systems, which form part of host natural immunity.

46,

47

A further element of complexity is reported in the recent work by Di Giorgio et al., according
47

to which both the adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) and the apolipoprotein B
mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) families of proteins are involved in
coronavirus genome editing - a process that may change the fate of both virus and patient.
Whatever the case, the lesson learned from RNA virus genetics and epidemiology is that
mutations are an inevitable consequence of being a virus. Yet, we also know that those
48

mutations that adversely impact any of the vital steps of virus function are swiftly eliminated
by natural selection. On the contrary, neutral variations and especially those mutations that
endow the virus with a competitive advantage can reach high frequencies.
Thus far, a steadily increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants have been emerging
and circulating all over the world since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although
all proteins encoded in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA are continuously reported and catalogued in the
plethora of databased and networks dedicated to COVID-19 genomic surveillance, the spike
49

protein is the one more often and constantly reported mutated in the viral genomes sequenced
worldwide. In this respect, both the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention
50

(CDC) and the equivalent European agency (ECDC), in collaboration with the World Health
Organization (WHO) and several governmental authorities and working groups have

developed a SARS-CoV-2 variant classification schema that groups all major viral variants
into main groups: variants of high consequence (VOHC, CDC), variants of concern (VOC),
variants of interest (VOI) and variants under monitoring (VUM, ECDC), depending on their
associated degree of impact on transmissibility, severity and/or reduced neutralization by
antibody/efficacy of Ab treatments (of note, European and US classification may not fully
coincide since the importance of variants may differ by location). At present no SARS-CoV-2
circulating variants have been classified as VOHC, while a substantial number them have been
marked as VOC and VOI/VUM by CDC and ECDC, and all of them are characterized by the
51

52

presence of at least one spike mutation of interest (MOI) (see the Conclusion section for a
52

more detailed discussion on this subject). The ability of SARS-CoV-2 mAbs to select any of
these variants that is apparently fit and that naturally occurs even at low frequencies in
circulating viral populations suggests that the therapeutic use of single mAb might select for
escape mutants, although the extent to which resistance will impact the effectiveness of Abs in
SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic and vaccine settings is still a matter of intense investigation.

In

this arena, the purpose of this work is to provide an atomistic-based, in silico perspective of
the role eventually played by currently circulating S-RBDCoV-2 mutations in escaping binding
of the two mAbs bamlanivimab and etesevimab as a proof of concept. A computational alanine
scanning (CAS) mutagenesis initially allowed us to identify the main molecular determinants
56

of each Ab/S-RBDCoV-2 recognition; then, each spike residues that, according to the CAS
results, contributes to the relevant viral protein/mAb binding interface was mutated into all
currently reported circulating mutations at that position, and the corresponding variation in
57

affinity of all mutated spikes for each mAb with respect to the wild-type viral protein was
estimated using a consolidate protocol. To quickly and effectively ranking the different spike
58

mutants with respect to their mAb escaping potential, a color-coded criterion based on the
predicted free energy difference range of values was adopted, as shown in Table 1. Of note,

this criterion is identical to the one we adopted and validated in our previous work for ranking
the effect of both ACE2 and S-RBDCoV-2 mutations on their mutual binding.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Computational Alanine Scanning of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Residues at the
Binding Interface with the LY-CoV555 (Bamlanivimab) Monoclonal Antibody. Within
distance and energetic cutoffs of 4.0 Å and 0.5 kcal/mol, respectively, the analysis of the
equilibrated molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory of LY-CoC555 in complex with the S-protein
RBD of SARS-CoV-2 shows that a total of 10 residues of S-RBDCoV-2 stably and effectively
contact 19 residues of the fragment antigen-binding (Fab) portion of the LY-CoV555 mAb, 14
of which locate on the heavy chain (HC) and 5 on the light chain (LC), respectively (Figure
2A and Table S1).

The results from the CAS (Figure 2B-C) identify both the S protein and the LY-CoV555
mAb residues that afford a significant contribution to the binding interface. Furthermore, CAS
data clearly indicate residues E484, Q493 and S494 on the S-RBDCoV-2 and RH50, RH96,
EH102, and RH104 on the mAb heavy chain as key positions contributing to shaping and
determining the stability of the relevant protein−protein interface, as discussed in details below.
E484. The confirmation of the E484 as a crucial residue was an expected result as a glutamic
acid (E) to lysine (K) substitution at this position (E484K) in the S-RBDCoV-2 is present in the
rapidly spreading variants of concern belonging to the B.1.351 (aka South African) and P.1
(Brazilian) lineages, while the E484Q/L452R double mutation is a component of the B.1.617
lineage that is currently dramatically spreading in India (vide infra). E484 locates at the tip of
a long, flexible loop in the S-RBDCoV-2; as such, any intermolecular interaction involving
E484 and LY-CoV555 could be important in eventually anchoring the entire superstructure.
The MD trajectory of the S-RBDCoV-2/LY-CoV555 complex shows that E484 is involved in
two tight and bifurcated salt-bridges with residues RH50 (2.74 ± 0.10 Å and 3.05 ± 0.14 Å) and
RL96 (2.82 ± 0.11 Å and 2.96 ± 0.13 Å) on the mAb HC and LC, respectively, flanked by
contact interactions (CIs) with the side chains of YH110 and YH101 (Figure 3A, Table S1).
When E484 is replaced with alanine in CAS, these interface-stabilizing interactions - along
with the slightly beneficial contribution from the intramolecular van der Waals contact with
the two Ab HC tyrosines - are no longer made, reflecting a loss of the corresponding binding
free energy of ΔΔGCoV-2(E484A) = −5.92 ± 0.12 kcal/mol (Figure 2B, Table S2).
Contextually, the corresponding values of ΔΔGLY-CoV555(RH50A) = −3.02 ± 0.19 kcal/mol
and ΔΔGLY-CoV555(RL96A) = −2.59 ± 0.11 kcal/mol (Figure 2C, Table S3) are in line with

the important contribution these residues provide to the formation of the corresponding viral
protein/antibody interface described above (Figure 3A).

Figure 3. Main interactions involving the viral S-RBDCoV-2 residues E484 (A), Q493 and S494
(B), and L452 (C) at the interface with the LY-CoV555 (bamlanivimab) mAb as obtained from
equilibrated MD simulations. In this and all remaining figures, the secondary structures of the
S-RBDCoV-2 is shown as a light tan ribbon, while the HC and LC of the LY-CoV555 mAb are
portrayed as light teal and light Tiffany ribbons, respectively. Each S-RBDCoV-2 residue under
discussion and all other residues directly interacting with it are highlighted in dark matchingcolored sticks and labeled; further residues/interactions related to the residue under
investigation are evidenced in light matching-colored sticks and labelled in light gray.
Hydrogen bonds (HBs) and salt bridges (SBs) are represented as dark green and dark red
broken lines, respectively, and the relevant average distances are reported accordingly. Further
important HBs and SBs detected in each complex are also indicated using light green/red
broken lines and light gray labels (see Table S1 for details).

Q493. At the 493 position of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, Q493 forms three stabilizing HBs
across the protein-protein interface, one with the side chain of LY-CoV555 EH102 (3.25 ± 0.18
Å) and two with the side chain and the C=O backbone of RH104 (3.31 ± 0.12 Å and 3.34 ±

0.17 Å), respectively (Figure 3B, Table S1). Thus, abrogation of these intermolecular contacts
by replacing the wild-type glutamine with alanine is accompanied by a ~4.2 kcal/mol loss in
binding free energy (ΔΔGCoV-2(Q493A) = −4.18 ± 0.14 kcal/mol, Figure 2B, Table S2).
Similarly, when either of the two LY-CoV555 residues EH102 or RH104 are mutated into
alanine, the related values of ΔΔG nicely reflect their importance in binding S-RBDCoV-2, as
ΔΔGLY-CoV555(EH102A) = −4.32 ± 0.13 kcal/mol and ΔΔGLY-CoV555(RH104A) = −4.58 ±
0.15 kcal/mol, respectively (Figure 2C, Table S3). Of note, these two mAb amino acids are
engaged in a fundamental internal SB (2.76 ± 0.11 Å, Figure 3B, Table S1) that appears to play
a major structural role in properly orienting their side chains for binding both Q493 and another
spike key residue – S494 – as discussed below.
S494. Serine 494 is an interesting SARS-CoV-2 RBD residue that has been previously
reported by us to form an internal HB with the side chain of the adjacent Q493, instrumental
to direct the latter in H-bridging aspartic acid 35 (D35) on the human ACE2 across their binding
interface.

56, 58

When in complex with LY-CoV555, S494 engages the side chains of the LY-

CoV555 mAb residues EH102 and RH104 in two intermolecular HBs (2.86 ± 0.16 Å and 3.18
± 0.19 Å, respectively), alongside a strong polar interaction with the viral N31 (Figure 3B,
Table S1). Thus, the S494A mutation actually shows a considerable variation in the
corresponding ΔΔG value (ΔΔGCoV-2(S494A) = −4.02 ± 0.12 kcal/mol, Figure 2B, Table S2)
making S494 the spike third protein/protein key residue.
V483, F486, and Y489. Predictably, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues V483, F486, and Y489
afford only a network of stabilizing intermolecular CIs to the viral protein/antibody binding
interface region centered around the nearby key residue E484 (Figure 3A). Specifically, the
side chain of V483 interacts – via van der Waals/hydrophobic contacts – with the side chains
of WH47, RH50 and NH59 on the Ab HC, and the side chains of TL94 and RL96 on the Ab LC,

respectively (Figure 3A, Table S1). Contextually, the phenyl ring of F486 engages two p/p
stacking interactions involving the side chains of the Ab LC YL32 and YL92, while the
aromatic moiety of Y489 establish dispersive/polar interactions with the LY-CoV555 residues
YH110 and YL32 on the Ab HC and LC, respectively (Figure 3A, Table S1). The absence of
these CIs when each of these residues is mutated into alanine reflects the moderate variations
of the corresponding free energy of binding (Figure 2B, Table S2), that is, ΔΔGCoV-2(V483A)
= −1.70 ± 0.18 kcal/mol, ΔΔGCoV-2(F486A) = −1.44 ± 0.15 kcal/mol, and ΔΔGCoV-2(Y489A)
= −1.12 ± 0.09 kcal/mol, respectively.
Y449, L452, T470, and F490. In analogy to what just discussed a few lines above, the main
role of residues Y449, L452, T470 and F490 on the S-RBDCoV-2 is also to reinforce the viral
protein/antibody binding interface region centered – in this case – around the two other
important residues Q493 and S494 by providing a number of favorable intermolecular CIs
(Figure 3B). In particular, Y449 provides three stabilizing polar interactions with the side
chains of TH28, SH30, and NH31, and is in van der Waals distance with IH54, all on the Ab
HC (Figure 3B, Table S1). L452 contacts the side chains of IH54 and LH55 on the LY-Cov555
Ab HC, while the last two spike residues T470 and F490 exchange nonpolar interactions with
the side chains of the Ab HC residues IH52, IH54, LH55 and IH57, in addition to the p/p
stacking observed between F490 and the Ab HC YH101 (Figure 3B, Table S1). This is
supported by the calculated ΔΔG value obtained by changing these amino acids into alanine
in the S-RBDCoV-2/LY-CoV555 Ab complex, that is, ΔΔGCoV-2(Y449A) = −1.93 ± 0.16,
ΔΔGCoV-2(L452A) = −0.76 ± 0.11 kcal/mol, ΔΔGCoV-2(T470A) = −0.64 ± 0.15, and
ΔΔGCoV-2(F490A) = −2.38 ± 0.22 (Figure 2B, Table S2).

In silico mutagenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Residues at the Binding
Interface with the LY-CoV555 (Bamlanivimab) Monoclonal Antibody. The recent survey
of data reported by Starr et al. led to the following list of naturally occurring mutations at the
57

SARS-CoV-2 S protein residues contacting the LY-CoV555 mAb: E484A/D/G/K/Q/R/V,
Q493H/K/L/R, S494A/P/R/T, L452M/Q/R, Y449D/F/H/N/S, T470A/I/K/N, V483A/F/G/I/L,
F486I/L/S, Y489C/F/H/S, and F490L/S/V/Y. In what follows, we report and discuss different
effects exerted by each of these spike mutant residues on the structure and strength of the
resulting S-RBDCoV-2 /LY-CoV555 binding interface. In analogy with our previous work
focused on the estimation of the difference in binding affinity between different allelic variants
of ACE2 or S-RBDCoV-2, in this study we adopt the same color-coded criterion based on the
58

predicted free energy difference range of values shown in Table 1.
E484. The CAS results discussed above clearly show that glutamic acid at the position 484
along the S protein wild-type sequence (E484) is a key player in the LY-CoV555/S-RBDCoV-2
interaction (Figures 2B and 3A, Tables S1-S2). Interesting, replacing the viral spike E484 with
each of the alternative residues considered (i.e., E484A/D/G/K/Q/R/V) reflects into a robust
interface disrupting behavior, with the mild exception of the E484D substitution (Figure 4A,
Figure S1, and Tables S4-S5). Figure 4B shows the results for the E484K as a representative
example. As seen from this Figure, in the presence of the K484 mutation the two topical,
bifurcate interface-stabilizing SBs between E484 and the side chains of LY-CoV55 RH50 and
RL96 (Figure 3A, Table S5) cannot obviously be established, while the background network
of CIs involving residues V483, F486, and Y489 on the S protein and WH47, YL92, YH110
and YH32 on the LY-CoV555 mAb remains almost unperturbed (Figure 4B, Figure S1, Table
S5).

the viral protein/LY-CoV555 mAb binding interface and the LY-CoV555 escaping potential
of the E484A, E484G, E484K, E484R, and E484V SARS-CoV-2 circulating mutants. The
charged-to-neutral isosteric replacement E484Q has a moderately destabilizing effect
(ΔΔGCoV-2(E484Q) = −2.53 ± 0.16 kcal/mol, Figure 4A, Table S4), since the two strong
bifurcated SBs characterizing the wild-type complex are replaced with two single HBs, one
between the side chain of Q484 and the side chain of arginine at position 50 of the mAb HC
(2.96 ± 0.11 Å), and one between the backbone C=O group of Q484 and the side chain of
arginine 96 of the Ab LC (2.70 ± 0.16 Å), respectively (Figure S1, Table S5). Finally, similarly
to E484 the mutated D484 can establish SB interactions with the side chains of LY-CoV555
RH50 (2.94 ± 0.13 Å) and RL96 (2.81 ± 0.19 Å and 3.26 ± 0.22 Å), along with the full network
of CIs seen in the wild-type complex, overall resulting in a predicted neutral effect on the
related protein/protein interface (ΔΔGCoV-2(E484D) = −0.61 ± 0.13 kcal/mol, Figure 4A,
Table S4, Figure S1 and Table S5).

Q493. According to relevant CAS-based prediction, Q493 also plays a primary stabilizing
role at the S-protein/LY-CoV555 mAb interface (Figure 2B, Tables S1-S2). The analysis of
the MD trajectories of all considered mutants (Q493H/K/L/R) reveals that, with respect to the
wild-type Q493, all residues except H493 induce a strong destabilizing effect at the interface
with the LY-CoV555 mAb (Figure 5A, Figure S2, Tables S4 and S6). With R493 as a proofof-principle, Figure 5B shows that this mutant is no longer able to form the three fundamental
HBs across the protein/protein interface with EH102, and RH104 on the Ab heavy chain,
respectively (see also Table S6). Moreover, the spike Y449 no longer engages the side chains

of the two LY-CoV555 mAb HC residues TH28 and SH31 in polar interactions, leaving the
rest of the CI network substantially unchanged (Figures 3B and 5B, Table S6). Accordingly,
the predicted affinity of this mutant viral protein for the LY-CoV55 mAb is markedly lower
than that of the native counterpart (ΔΔGCoV-2(Q493R) = −4.57 ± 0.11 kcal/mol, Figure 5A,
Table S4). Analogous effects are predicted for the other two mutants Q493K and Q493L,
reflecting in a comparable decrease of protein/protein binding strength (ΔΔGCoV-2(Q493K) =
−4.83 ± 0.12 kcal/mol and ΔΔGCoV-2(Q493L) = −4.26 ± 0.18 kcal/mol, respectively, Figure
5A, Table S4, Figure S2 and Table S6). These data therefore suggest that the Q493K/L/R
mutants could all be LY-CoV555 escaping mutants. At variance with these, mutating Q493
into histidine introduce a somewhat less drastic changes in the topology of the viral proteinantibody interface. In particular, Q493H is still able to preserve one HB with the side chain of
the LY-CoV555 RH104 (3.39 ± 0.15 Å) while the second HB interaction with the same mAb
residue is replaced by a p/cation interaction (Figure S2, Table S6). Notably, the HB between
H493 and EH102 is also missing in the entire MD trajectory of this S-RBDCoV-2 mutant/mAb
complex, in addition to the polar CI between Y449 on spike and TH28 on LY-CoV555 (Figure
S2, Table S6). In line with this, a moderate variation of the corresponding free energy of

S494. The third SARS-CoV-2 spike position highlighted by the CAS results as a key residue
in binding the LY-CoV555 mAb is S494 (Figure 2B). Mutagenesis of this residue into A, P,
R, and T reflects into strong interface destabilizing effects, exception made for the S494T
substitution for which only a mild effect is observed (Figure 6A, Table S4). In the case of the
R494 mutant, the current MD simulations show that both main intermolecular HBs in which
the wild-type residue is involved (i.e., S494-EH102 and S494-RH104) are longer detected in
the trajectory of the correspondent mutant viral protein/mAb complex (Figure 6B, Table S7).
Also, two out of three further stabilizing HBs between the adjacent and important Q493 residue
on S-RBDCoV-2 and the side chains of LY-CoV555 EH102 and RH104 are no longer formed
in the presence of the R494 mutation (Figures 3B and 6B, Table S7). These evidences, along
with several missing stabilizing CIs at the protein/protein interface (see Table S7 for details),
concur to lower the predicted affinity of the R494 mutant S-RBDCoV-2 for the LY-CoV555

When S-RBDCoV-2 S494 is mutated into threonine (S494), the MD-predicted interaction
network at the corresponding Ab binding interface is only moderately perturbed with respect
to that described above for the wild-type complex; in particular, only the HBs between T494
on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and EH102 on the HC of LY-CoV555, and between the viral Q493
and the same glutamic acid on the Ab HC are replaced by two polar CIs (Figure S3, Table S7).

In line with this, the related value of ΔΔGCoV-2(S494T) is slightly unfavorable and equal to 0.70 ± 0.15 kcal/mol (Figure 6A and Table S4).

(see also Tables S12 for details). Colors and other explanations are the same as in Figure 3.

Together with T470 and F490, the spike residue L452 is a part of a hydrophobic region at
the binding interface with LY-CoV555; accordingly, when this amino acid is replaced by the
small non-polar methionine or even by the polar glutamine, the corresponding viral/antibody
interface remains almost unaffected (Figures 8B and S8, Table S12). On the contrary, upon
mutation of L452 into the positively charged and long-chained asparagine, a substantial
modification of the relative binding region is observed in the corresponding MD trajectory, as
shown in Figure 8E. Specifically, the structurally-important internal SB between the side
chains of LY-CoV555 EH102 and RH104 on the Ab HC (Figure 3B) is no longer detected, as
it is replaced by an analogous yet intermolecular interaction between the former mAb residue
and the mutant spike R452 (3.15 ± 0.11 Å). Contextually, however, the formation of this new
interface SB is accompanied by the loss of all other crucial intermolecular interactions
involving both S-RBDCoV-2 key residues Q493 and S494 (Figure 8E, Table S12). This, in turn,
properly reflects in the substantial variation of the corresponding binding free energy value, so
that ΔΔGCoV-2(L452R) = −5.29 ± 0.15 kcal/mol, Figure 8B, Table S4), thereby supporting the
LY-CoV55 escaping potential of this SARS-CoV-2 spike isoform.

and all related energy terms, see the text and Tables S16-S17.

According to the CAS results shown in Figure 9B-C (see also Tables S16-S17), and at
variance with the binding mode just discussed for the alternative mAb LY-Cov555, the viral
RBD/LY-CoV016 binding interface is substantially more diffused and characterized by four
distinct regions, the first of which locates in the area centered around the S-RBDCoV-2 residues
K417 and N460 (Figure 10A).

residues/interactions related to the residue under investigation are evidenced in light matchingcolored sticks and labelled in light gray. Hydrogen bonds (HBs) and salt bridges (SBs) are
represented as dark green and dark red broken lines, respectively, and the relevant average
distances are reported accordingly. Further important HBs and SBs detected in each complex
are also indicated using light green/red broken lines and light gray labels (see Table S15 for
details).

Specifically, the MD trajectory of the S-RBDCoV-2/LY-CoV016 complex shows that K417
binds the side chain of DH104 on the mAb HC via a bifurcated SB (2.92 ± 0.15 Å and 3.10 ±
0.17 Å). Additionally, the K417 side chain is also involved in a stable HB with YH52 (2.98 ±
0.14 Å) and in CI distance with the side chains of YH33 (ΔΔGLY-CoV016(YH33A) = −2.37 ±
0.12 kcal/mol) and PH100 (ΔΔGLY-CoV016(PH100A) = −1.27 ± 0.10 kcal/mol (see Figures 9C
and 10A, and Tables S15 and S17). In agreement with this interaction pattern, the K417A
mutation in CAS reduces the binding affinity of the corresponding S-RBDCoV-2 for the LYCoV016 mAb by 6 kcal/mol (ΔΔG CoV-2(K417A) = −6.01 ± 0.10 kcal/mol, Figure 9B, Table
S16). In the same context, the corresponding values of ΔΔGLY-CoV016(DH104A) = −2.81 ±
0.15 kcal/mol and ΔΔGLY-CoV016(YH52A) = −1.55 ± 0.11 kcal/mol (Figure 9C, Table S17)
properly rank the relative importance of these LY-Cov016 mAb residues at corresponding viral
protein/antibody interface described above.
On the other hand, the S-RBDCoV-2 N460 residue is involved in two permanent HBs with
the side chain of SH56 (3.04 ± 0.09 Å) and with the oxygen atom of the backbone of GH54
(3.12 ± 0.17 Å), and the relevant value of DDG obtained by CAS for the N460A mutation
(ΔΔGCoV-2(N460A) = −2.75 ± 0.11 kcal/mol, Figure 9B, Table S16) confirms the fundamental
role of this spike residue at the binding interface. Interestingly, the change in binding free

energy predicted by CAS for the SH56A substitution on the LY-Cov016 mAb (ΔΔGLYCoV016(SH56A) = −3.80 ± 0.16 kcal/mol, Figure 9C, Table S17) accounts for the existence of

additional stabilizing interactions in this region, characterized by a strong and virtuous network
of HBs and CIs. In detail, SH56 is also involved in two stable HBs with the hydroxyl group of

(3.07 ± 0.15 Å, ΔΔGCoV-2(D420A) = −2.01 ± 0.11 kcal/mol), respectively (Figures 9B and
10A, and Tables S15-S16). Moreover, two additional S-RBDCoV-2 residues concur in
determining the stability of the protein/protein interface (Figure 10A, Table S15): Y421
(ΔΔGCoV-2(Y421A) = −2.47 ± 0.18 kcal/mol) and Q493 (ΔΔGCoV-2(Q493A) = −1.59 ± 0.14
kcal/mol) (Figure 9B and Table S16). Specifically, the spike tyrosine 421 performs two HBs
with LY-CoV016 SH53 (3.09 ± 0.11 Å, ΔΔGLY-CoV016(SH53A) = −2.56 ± 0.15 kcal/mol) and
the nitrogen backbone atom of GH54 (3.21 ± 0.14 Å), respectively, while glutamine 493 is
involved in the same type of intermolecular interaction with the amide moiety of the backbone
of YH102 (3.03 ± 0.18 Å), in addition to a favorable CI with the side chain of MH101 (Figures
9C and 10A, Table S15 and S17).
The second important region for the stabilization of the S-RBDCoV-2/LY-CoV016 complex
is mainly composed by the viral residues Y473, N487 and Y489 (Figure 10B, Table S15) and
the mAb HC residue RH97. Indeed, two HBs are detected between the guanidine moiety of
RH97 (ΔΔGLY-CoV016(RH97A) = −2.03 ± 0.08 kcal/mol, Figure 9C, Table S17) and the side
chain of N487 (2.86 ± 0.15 Å, ΔΔGCoV-2(N487A) = −2.03 ± 0.16 kcal/mol) and the hydroxyl
group of Y489 (3.38 ± 0.13 Å, ΔΔGCoV-2(Y489A) = −1.84 ± 0.09 kcal/mol), respectively
(Figures 9B and 10B, and Tables S15-S16). Additionally, the CIs of these viral protein amino
acids with the LY-CoV016 HC residues FH27, LH99 (ΔΔGLY-CoV016(LH99A) = −0.89 ± 0.15
kcal/mol), and MH101 (ΔΔGLY-CoV016(MH101A) = −1.78 ± 0.14 kcal/mol) further contribute

to binding interface stabilization (Figure 10B, Table S15, Figure 9C, Table S17). Moreover,
the S-RBDCoV-2 Y473 (ΔΔGCoV-2(Y473A) = −2.08 ± 0.12 kcal/mol) is stably engaged in an
HB with the side chain of SH31 (2.83 ± 0.21 Å, ΔΔGLY-CoV016(SH31A) = −0.98 ± 0.17
kcal/mol) and in a polar interaction with SH53 (Figure 9B-C, Figure10B, Tables S15-S17).
Located in between the two protein/protein interface regions just described, the third binding
zone is identified by a network of van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions mainly involving
the S-RBDCoV-2 residues L455 (ΔΔGCoV-2(L455A) = −1.20 ± 0.16 kcal/mol) and F456
(ΔΔGCoV-2(F456A) = −2.49 ± 0.13 kcal/mol) (see Figures 9B and 10C, Tables S1 and S16).
In particular, this hydrophobic patch at the S-RBDCoV-2/LY-CoV016 mAb interface sees F456
as the pivot point that coordinates and to appropriately orient the mAb residues YH33, SH53,
LH99, PH100 and MH101 for further protein/protein interactions (Figure 10C, Table S15).
Finally, the last detected binding region – although apparently not a primary determinant of
the viral/Ab interface stabilization – supports the optimization of the mutual protein/protein
recognition. Indeed, this region involves only the LY-CoV016 mAb LC residues YL32
(ΔΔGLY-CoV016(YL32A) = −1.12 ± 0.10 kcal/mol), YL92 (ΔΔGLY-CoV016(YL92A) = −0.99
± 0.16 kcal/mol), and TL94 (ΔΔGLY-CoV016(TL94A) = −1.15 ± 0.12 kcal/mol) in a set of stable
HBs with the viral spike residues E406 (2.84 ± 0.27 Å, ΔΔGCoV-2(E406A) = −1.29 ± 0.13
kcal/mol), the hydroxyl group of Y505 (3.01 ± 0.19 Å, ΔΔGCoV-2(Y505A) = −1.87 ± 0.12
kcal/mol), and the nitrogen backbone atom of the same tyrosine (3.14 ± 0.13 Å) (Figures 9BC and 10D, and Tables S15-S17).

The same data survey reported by Starr and coworkers led us to identify the following
57

naturally occurring mutations at the SARS-CoV-2 S protein residues contacting the LYCoV016 Ab: E406D/Q, T415A/I/N/P/S, K417E/N/R/T, D420A/G/N, L455F/S/V, F456L/Y,
N460I/K/S/T, Y473F/H, N487D, Y489C/F/H/S, Q493H/K/L/R and Y505F/H/W. Below, we
report and discuss different effects exerted by each of these spike mutant residues on the
structure and strength of the resulting S-RBDCoV-2 /LY-CoV016 binding interface by adopting
again the same color-coded criterion shown in Table 1.
K417. Our CAS data highlight the wild-type K417 as a hot-spot residue in the interaction
between the S-RBDCoV-2 and the LY-CoV016 mAb (Figure 9B and 10A, Tables S15-S16).
As such, is not surprising that replacing K417 on the viral protein with each of the alternative
circulating mutants (K417E/N/R/T) reflects into a very strong interface disrupting behavior,
with the exception of the substitution K417R, for which our in silico mutagenesis data
anticipate a neutral effect (Figures 11 and S11, Tables S18-S19). As seen in Figure 11B for the
K417N mutant as a paradigm, the current MD simulations show that both the double SB with
the side chain of LY-CoV016 DH104 and the HB between the charged amine group of K417
and the hydroxyl moiety of YH52 cannot longer be detected in the MD trajectory of the mutant
complex. Also, the K417 network of underlying CIs involving a polar interaction with YH33
and a hydrophobic contact with PH100 is likewise perturbed when K is replaced by N at the
same position (Figure 11B, Table S19). Quite importantly, in the same binding region the
presence of N417 affects other protein/protein interactions, including the absence of the three
stabilizing HBs between N460 and GH54, T415 and SH56, and Y421 and SH53, respectively
(Figure 11B, Table S19). These evidences ultimately translate into a drastically lower affinity
of the N417 mutant spike protein for the LY-CoV016 mAb (ΔΔGCoV-2(K417N) = −7.27 ±
0.07 kcal/mol, Figure 11A and Table S18).

computational mutagenesis of the S-RBDCoV-2 wild-type residue K417 for the corresponding
S-RBDCoV-2/LY-CoV016 mAb complex. Negative ΔΔG values indicate unfavorable
substitutions for the mutant residue in the relevant position. The numerical values of ΔΔG, all
related energy terms, and all underlying intermolecular interactions are reported in Table S18,
Figure S11, and Table S19. In this and all other similar figures, the colored boxes below each
bar in the graphs show the classification of the destabilizing effects of the corresponding
mutation on the S-RBDCoV-2/LY-CoV016 Ab complex. Color legend: gray, neutral mutations;
light yellow, mildly destabilizing mutations; light red, destabilizing mutations; red, highly

also Table S19 for details). Colors and other explanations are the same as in Figure 10.

The effects observed for the E417 and T417 spike mutants are completely similar to those
just described for the N417 isoform, although in both these cases the interface HB between the
side chains of N460 and GH54 is again detected yet at the expenses of the analogous interaction
between the viral Q493 and the mAb YH102, which is missing along the entire MD trajectories

of the corresponding supramolecular assemblies. As such, the variation in binding free energy
between the wild-type and a mutant spike protein carrying either E or T at position 417 in
complex with the LY-CoV016 mAb is predicted to be quite significant (ΔΔGCoV-2(K417E) =
−7.56 ± 0.18 kcal/mol and ΔΔGCoV-2(K417T) = −7.14 ± 0.09 kcal/mol, Figure 11A, Table
S18). On the other hand, only minor interface perturbations are observed in the presence of the
R417 mutation (Figure S11, Table S19), in line with the predicted small change in
protein/protein affinity (ΔΔGCoV-2(K417R) = −0.99 ± 0.15 kcal/mol, Figure 11A, Table S18).
D420 and N460. Converting the SARS-CoV-2 spike residues D420 and N460 in alanine via
CAS analysis suggests that these two mutant isoforms induce only limited perturbing effects
at the relative S-RBDCoV-2/LY-CoV016 mAb binding interface (Figures 9B and 10A, and
Table S16). Surprisingly, however, the computational mutagenesis data for all circulating viral
mutations at these two spike positions (D420A/G/N and N460I/K/S/T) reveal strong interfacedestabilizing effects in all cases, with difference in free energy of binding with respect to the
wild-type protein ranging from ~ -5 to ~ -3 kcal/mol (i.e., ΔΔGCoV-2(D420A) = −4.36 ± 0.17
kcal/mol, ΔΔGCoV-2(D420G) = −4.39 ± 0.10 kcal/mol, ΔΔGCoV-2(D420N) = −4.23 ± 0.10

Figure 12. Change in binding free energy (ΔΔG = ΔGWILD-TYPE − ΔGMUTANT) predicted by
computational mutagenesis of the S-RBDCoV-2 wild-type residue D420 (A) and N460 (C) for
the corresponding S-RBDCoV-2/LY-CoV016 mAb complex. Negative ΔΔG values indicate
unfavorable substitutions for the mutant residue in the relevant position. The numerical values
of ΔΔG, all related energy terms, and all underlying intermolecular interactions are reported
in Table 18, Figures S12-S13, and Tables S20-S21. Main interactions involving the SRBDCoV-2 D420A (B) and N460I (D) mutants at the interface with the LY-CoV016

D420G/N and N460K/S/T mutants are shown in Figures S12-S13 (see also Tables S20-S21 for
details). Colors and other explanations are the same as in Figure 10.

The molecular rationale for these results relies not only on the fact all D420 and N460 SRBDCoV-2 variants remove all direct interactions provided by aspartic acid (420) or glutamine
(460) but also exert a domino effect on the nearby spike residues populating the same binding
region, including T415 and, above all, the hot spot K417. Considering A420 as an exemplar of
all D420 mutant behavior, from Figure 12B it is quickly seen that the wild-type HB with the
side chain of SH56 is evidently missing, as are the three topical HBs between T415 and SH56,
between K417 and YH52, and between N460 and GH54, respectively (see also Figure S12 and
Table S20). Similarly, taking I460 as a proof-of-concept for the N460 variants, the relevant

MD trajectory reveals the absence of the same HBs engaged by the side chains of T145 and
K147 on the viral spike and those of SH56 and YH52 on the Ab, respectively. At the same time
the direct wild-type 460 intermolecular HBs with GH54 and SH56 are obviously suppressed in
the I460 Spike mutant/mAb complex, along with loss of the same interaction between Y421
and SH53 across the respective protein/protein interface (Figures 12D and S13, Table S21).
T415 and Q493. Although these two SARS-CoV-2 S protein residues belong to the first
binding region centered around two key viral amino acids in the stabilization of the SRBDCoV-2/LY-CoV016 mAb interface – N460 and K417, respectively (Figure 10A) – the
ΔΔG values currently predicted for replacement of both these spike positions with all reported
variants (T415A/I/N/S and Q493H/K/L/R) indicate only moderate interface perturbation
outcomes, with the notable deviation of the T415P mutant, for which a robust loss in affinity
of this viral variant for the mAb is anticipated (Figures 13A-B and S14-S15, Tables S18 and
S22-23).

computational mutagenesis of the S-RBDCoV-2 wild-type residues T415 (A) and Q493 (B) for
the corresponding S-RBDCoV-2/LY-CoV016 mAb complexes. Colors and other explanations
as in Figure 4. The numerical values of ΔΔG, all related energy terms, and all underlying
intermolecular intramolecular interactions are reported in Table S18, Figures S14-S15, and
Tables S22-S23. (C) Main interactions involving the S-RBDCoV-2 T415P mutant at the

Figures S14-S15 (see also Tables S22-S23 for details). Colors and other explanations are the
same as in Figure 10.

In detail, while the conservative mutation T415S ensues the preservation of the wild-type
interaction network, in the case of the T415A/I/N variants the analysis of the present
simulations shows that the two spike-mAb anchoring intermolecular HBs in which the wildtype residue is involved (i.e., T415-SH56 and K417-YH52, Figure 10A) cannot longer be
detected in the trajectory of the mutant complexes. However, the extensive underlying network
of other SBs, HBs, and CIs remains almost unaffected across the corresponding binding
interfaces (Figure S14, Table S22), ultimately resulting in a limited decrement of the
corresponding free energy variations (Figure 13A, Table S18). In the case of the T415P variant,
the remarkably negative effect on spike/mAb affinity predicted by our in silico mutagenesis is
sensibly linked – aside for the same perturbating effects just discussed for the other mutations
at the same viral protein location – to the absence of the additional interface HB and CIs
between the side chains of Q493 on the spike and of YH102 on the mAb HC (Figure 13C, Table
S22). Accordingly, the S-RBDCoV-2 T415P mutation reported so far in circulating viral

populations is predicted to be potentially destabilizing for the S-RBDCoV-2/LY-CoV016
interface (ΔΔGCoV-2(T415P) = −2.83 ± 0.07 kcal/mol, Figure 13A and Table S18).
Y473, N487 and Y489. These viral residues belong to the spike/LY-Cov016 binding region
that, according to the relevant MD trajectories, is characterized by an important network of
stabilizing hydrogen bonds. Nevertheless, the present computational mutagenesis data report
only neutral-to-mild interface destabilizing effects for the circulating SARS-CoV-2 RBD
variants of Y473 (Y473F/H) and N487 (N487D) (see Table S18, Figures S16-S17, and Tables
S24-S25 for details). Briefly, in the case of the Y473F mutation the loss of the HB between the
wild-type tyrosine and the side chain of SH31 on the LY-CoV016 mAb HC (Figure 10B)
detected in the MD trajectories of all variants has only minor effects on all other important
intermolecular interactions populating same region, while the phenylalanine-to-histidine
mutation is virtually conservative (ΔΔGCoV-2(Y473F) = −1.67 ± 0.08 kcal/mol and
ΔΔGCoV-2(Y473H) = −0.19 ± 0.16 kcal/mol, respectively, Table S18, Figure S16, Table S24).
The predicted minor loss in binding affinity of the D487 spike variant for the LY-CoV016 mAb
(ΔΔGCoV-2(N487D) = −0.70 ± 0.09 kcal/mol, Table S18), on the other hand, is the result of a
compensatory effect as the mutant aspartic acid provides a permanent intermolecular SB with
the guanidine group of the Ab RH97 that makes up for the loss of the two HBs between Y473
and SH31 and Y489 and RH97, respectively (Figures 10B and S17, Table S25).
Finally, according to our MD analysis the circulating Y489 S-RBDCoV-2 variants induce a
moderate decrease in affinity of the viral spike protein for the LY-CoV016 mAb (Figure 14A,
Table S18). In particular, the conversion of tyrosine 489 into cysteine or serine results in the
abrogation of the direct HB with RH97 as well as the hydrophobic contact with LH99.
Moreover, the HB involving Y473 and SH31 is also missing along the entire MD trajectories

The purpose of this work was to provide an in silico molecular rationale of the role eventually
played by currently circulating S-RBDCoV-2 mutations in evading the immune surveillance
effects elicited by the two Eli Lilly LY-CoV555/bamlanivimab and LY-CoV016/etesevimab
monoclonal antibodies. Table 2 summarizes the main findings from this study and shows that,
compared to the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, all mutants highlighted in light or dark
red are predicted to be markedly more resistant to neutralization by both these mAbs, those
shown in yellow might exert only mildly perturbing protein/protein binding, while those listed
in gray are not likely to confer any mAb escaping advantage to the viral protein.

According to the most updated version (March 18, 2021) of the” Fact sheet for health care
providers – emergency use authorization (EUA) of bamlanivimab and etesevimab”, resistant
59

variants to both mAbs were already reported by Eli-Lilly researchers using S-protein directed
evolution and serial passages in cell cultures of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of either
antibody. On the other hand, resistant variants were not reported when the two mAbs were
tested together using the same methodology. Spike variants identified in these studies that
presented reduced susceptibility to the LY-CoV555 mAb included the following substitutions:
E484D/K/Q, F490S, Q493R, and S494P. Concerning the spike position 484, after our CAS
approach identified E484 as a key player residue at the S-RBDCoV-2/LY-CoV555 binding
interface (Figures 2A and 3A, Table S2), we considered all possible mutations actually reported
at this position in circulating viral variants (i.e., E484A/D/G/K/Q/R/V), and found that all these
amino acid variations should confer strong escaping ability to bamlanivimab (Figures 4, Table
2). From a validation standpoint, the E484K mutation is present in a large number of
VOC/VOI/VUM - including the lineages B.1.525 (firstly reported in Nigeria on 12/20), P.1
and P.2 (Brazil, 12/20), P.3 (The Philippines, 01/21), B.1.351 (South Africa, 09/20), B.1.621
(Colombia, 01/2021), and some strains of lineages B.1.1.7 (firstly reported in the United
Kingdom on 09/20) and B.1.526 (reported on 11/20 in the city of New York, USA)

51, 52

- and it

is indeed well known to confer substantial loss of sensitivity to neutralizing Abs found in sera
of convalescent and vaccinated individuals.

60 61-71

Further, for all these variants there is evidence

of a significant reduction in neutralization by the LY-CoV555/LY-CoV016 and other mAb

treatments.

Collier and coworkers very recently reported that the introduction of the

57, 60, 72-75

E484K mutation in the B.1.1.7 background (to account for the new VOC B.1.1.7+E484K found
in the virus isolated both in UK and in Pennsylvania, USA) led to robust loss of neutralizing
76

activity by 19 out of 31 vaccine-elicited antibodies and mAbs if compared with the decrease in
sensitivity conferred by the mutations in B.1.1.7 alone. Moreover, the E484Q/V/A/G/D
77

mutations have been just described by Chen et al. as critical in promoting escape not only from
Eli Lilly mAbs but also from other similar therapeutics that are currently in clinical trials.

78

Mutating the wild-type spike F490 into alanine also flagged this position as a residue
affording an important contribution to the protein/protein interface (Figure 2A, Table S2).
Interestingly, the corresponding mutagenesis into all reported variants (F490L/S/V/Y) revealed
that only the F490S spike mutant is a potential escapee for LY-CoV555 (Figures 8, Table 2),
in agreement with Lilly’s and other experimental observations.

59, 66, 78

Of note F490S, although

listed in the actual spike circulating mutations, is not a component of any VOC or VOI listed
so far.

51, 52

Finally, CAS predicted viral spike residues Q493 and S494 to be the two remaining

hot spots at the viral protein/bamlanivimab binding interface (Figures 2A and 3B, Table S2).
In silico mutagenesis of Q493 and S494 into the circulating variants (Q493H/K/L/R, and
S494A/P/R/T) not only confirms Lilly’s data about Q493R and S494P as resistant mutations
for LY-CoV555 but also predicts a potential role of other substitutions at these two S-protein
59

positions (i.e., Q493K/L and S494A/P/R) in mediating evasion to this mAb (Figures 5-6, Table
2). In line with these predictions, three new studies highlighted all these mutants as vir
al proteins that may hinder the efficiency of existing vaccines and expand in response to the
increasing after-infection or vaccine-induced seroprevalence.

66, 78, 79

Remarkably, the spike S494P

mutation is a component of the B.1.17+S494P VOC /VUM identified in United Kingdom in
51

January 2021.

In the fact sheet produced by Lilly the spike 452 position was not mentioned as a possible
59

site of LY-CoV555 escaping mutant per se. However, L452R is a spike mutation of interest
(MOI) present in the VOC lineages B.1.427/B.1.429 (reported in California, USA, on 09/20),
52

B.1.526.1 (New York City, USA, 10/20), and in the B1.617.1/B.1.617.2/B.1.617.3 lineages
now rapidly and deadly spreading in India (12/20-02/21), where it is always found along with
the D614G substitution. Importantly, the L452R mutation is also present in tandem with
E484Q, in particular in the B.1.617.1 variant that is responsible for actual disease outbreaks in
49 countries in all six WHO regions. Using a pseudo-virus expressing the spike protein from
80

the B.1.427/B.1.429 lineages, or the L452R substitution only, however, the researchers at Lilly
reported reduced susceptibility to bamlanivimab and etesevimab together of 7.7-fold or 7.4fold, respectively.

59

Further experimental works

81-84

already reported increased viral

load/transmissibility and escape ability from neutralizing antibodies for this variant when
tested against vaccine-elicited sera. Actually, in their preprint work Hoffmann et al. analyzed
whether the SARS-CoV-2 VOC B.1.617 is more adept in entering cells and/or evade Ab
responses. They found that B.1617 entered two out of 8 cell lines tested (specifically, the
85

human lung- and intestine-derived Calu-3 and Caco-2 cell lines, respectively) with slightly
increased efficiency, and was blocked by an entry inhibitor. However, in stark contrast, B.1.167
was found to be fully resistant to LY-CoV555 and partially resistant against neutralization by
Abs elicited upon infection or vaccination with the Comirnaty/Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Our
present data support the escaping potential of the L452R viral mutation with respect to
bamlanivimab (Figure 8, panels B and E, Table 2), while we did not detect any effect in terms
of changed affinity of this mutant protein toward etesevimab. Moreover, our data also suggest
that the co-presence of the E484Q (Figure 5, Table 2) may synergistically contribute in
rendering the two B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.3 variants potent evaders of antibody surveillance.

Concerning the alternative LY-CoV016 mAb, the official Lilly’s fact sheet reports that
59

SARS-CoV-2 spike mutants showing reduced susceptibility to etesevimab include
substitutions K417N, D420N, and N460K/S/T. In agreement with this and other evidences,

72, 79

our current computational alanine/mutagenesis study marks K417 and all its reported variants
(K417E/N/R/T) as the strongest hot spots in eliciting potential escape to the LY-CoV016 mAb
(Figure 11A, Table 2). Of note, the K417N and K417T in particular are spike MOIs in the
SARS-CoV2 VOC lineages B.1.351 and P.1, respectively. Similarly, not only the D420N but
all reported circulating spike mutations at positions 420 are predicted by our study to be
endowed with high LY-CoV016 escaping potential (Figure 12A, Table 2), in line with recent
findings. Finally, and in full agreement with Lilly’s data, LY-CoV016 is also found to be
79

59

escaped by all spike N460 variations (N460I/K/S/T) (Figure 12C, Table 2).
In addition, in the current study we identify three further single amino acid changes along
the primary sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that – although not reported as current
VOC/VOI/VUM – could escape the action of LY-CoV016, that is the T415P and the Y489C/S
mutations (Figures 13A and 14A, Table2). Since these spike mutants are present in circulating
viral variants, in our opinion they should be taken into consideration as they might limit the
therapeutic usefulness of this mAb, both per se and in its cocktail combination with LYCoV555.
As a conclusive remark concerning available anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, according to the
report by Andreano and Rappuoli published on May 10, 2021 in Nature Medicine the efficacy
86

of the FDA/EMA approved Ad26.COV2-S vaccine (now Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine) and the
EMA approved Oxford–AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 (now Vaxzevria) against the variant B.1.351
(South Africa, with E484K, K417N and N501Y as spike MOIs) decreased from 85% to 57%
and from 62% to 10%, respectively. In parallel, the titer neutralizing antibodies induced by the
m-RNA vaccines approved by both governmental agencies (i.e., the BNT162b2

41

Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine/Comirnaty and COVID-19 vaccine Moderna) against the
same SARS-CoV-2 variant is reported to decline by 7- to 12 -fold, while no negative effect on
neutralization is seen for the B.1.1.7 variant (with N501Y/D614G as spike MOIs).
Additionally, the work of Planas and collaborators documented low titers of neutralizing
antibodies against the B.1.351 variant in a cohort of 19 individuals after both doses of the
Comirnaty vaccine. In all these cases, the spike E484K mutation appears to be the real key
87

player in reducing neutralization by antibodies induced by the vaccines. And this, in turn,
support the view that vaccination elicits a natural infection–like antibody response, and that
spike variants like E484K may spread as antigenic evolutions of SARS-CoV-2 to efficiently
evade this response. On the bright side, all vaccines currently approved appear at least to protect
from the severe forms of infection,

88, 89

and second-generation vaccines and mAbs aiming at

containing VOC spreading are under investigation.

90

In concluding this work, we report that a challenge of our global in silico results against the
relevant experimental data just published by the Starr group resulted in an overall 90%
57

agreement. This achievement not only constitutes a further, robust validation of our computerbased approach but also yields a molecular-based rationale for all relative experimental
findings, and leads us to conclude that the current circulating SARS-CoV-2 and all possible
emergent variants carrying these mutations in the spike protein can present new challenges for
mAb-based therapies and ultimately threaten the fully-protective efficacy of currently available
vaccines.
