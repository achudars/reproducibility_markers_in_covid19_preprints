SUMMARY

30

With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmissibility and

31

potential resistance, antibodies and vaccines with broadly inhibitory activity are needed. Here we

32

developed a panel of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs that bind the receptor binding domain

33

of the spike protein at distinct epitopes and block virus attachment to cells and its receptor,

34

human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE2). While several potently neutralizing mAbs

35

protected K18-hACE2 transgenic mice against infection caused by historical SARS-CoV-2

36

strains, others induced escape variants in vivo and lost activity against emerging strains. We

37

identified one mAb, SARS2-38, that potently neutralizes all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern

38

tested and protects mice against challenge by multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains. Structural analysis

39

showed that SARS2-38 engages a conserved epitope proximal to the receptor binding motif.

40

Thus, treatment with or induction of inhibitory antibodies that bind conserved spike epitopes

41

may limit the loss of potency of therapies or vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

INTRODUCTION

43

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2

44

belong to the Sarbecovirus subgenus of Betacoronaviruses (Viruses, 2020). In little more than a

45

year, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the rapid emergence of

46

SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in over 140 million infections and 3 million deaths worldwide

47

(https://covid19.who.int/). Multiple effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 that prevent

48

COVID-19 have been rapidly developed and deployed (Baden et al., 2021; Polack et al., 2020;

49

Sadoff et al., 2021; Voysey et al., 2021). Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) also have shown efficacy

50

in animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Alsoussi et al., 2020; Baum et al., 2020a; Fagre et

51

al., 2020; Hansen et al., 2020; Hassan et al., 2020; Kreye et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Shi et

52

al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020), and two mAb treatments are approved for use in patients under

53

Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) (Chen et al., 2021b; Weinreich et al., 2021). Therapy with

54

mAbs may be beneficial to high-risk patients following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 with mild or

55

moderate symptoms, but prior to onset of severe disease signs and symptoms, and can

56

complement the usage of vaccines as a means of combating the COVID-19 pandemic.

57

The majority of characterized potently neutralizing and protective anti-SARS-CoV-2

58

mAbs bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein (Barnes et al., 2020;

59

Baum et al., 2020a; Cao et al., 2020; Tortorici et al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020), though some

60

inhibitory mAbs against the N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike also have been described (Chi et

61

al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Suryadevara et al., 2021). Under immune selection pressure, SARS-

62

CoV-2 can select for mutations in the RBD and NTD that enable escape from antibody

63

recognition and neutralization (Baum et al., 2020b; Greaney et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Starr et

64

al., 2021; Suryadevara et al., 2021). Indeed, several emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants have

65

mutations in the spike protein, including the RBD and NTD, that confer resistance to mAbs or

66

polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) elicited by vaccines or natural infection (Chen et al., 2021d;

67

Thomson et al., 2021; Weisblum et al., 2020). As such, additional mAbs or vaccines that retain

68

efficacy against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants may be needed to combat new and evolving

69

strains.

70

In this study, we describe a panel of potently neutralizing murine mAbs against the RBD

71

of SARS-CoV-2 that bind several epitopes proximal to the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the

72

RBD or at the base of the RBD. Although some neutralizing mAbs demonstrated limited ability

73

to protect against infection by the historical SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 strain in a mouse disease

74

model and selected for rapid escape in vivo, others protected completely in the context of

75

prophylactic or therapeutic administration. Two protective mAbs, SARS2-02 and SARS2-38,

76

showed variable capacity to neutralize variants of concern (VOCs): SARS2-02 binds an epitope

77

that includes residues E484 and L452 and has reduced potency against strains (B.1.429, B.1.351,

78

and B.1.1.28) encoding these mutations. In contrast, SARS2-38 binds an epitope centered on

79

residues K444 and G446 and potently neutralized all tested VOCs. Analysis of a cryo-electron

80

microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of SARS2-38 bound to spike reveals that this mAb binds a

81

conserved epitope on the RBD that is also engaged, albeit through distinct geometries, by other

82

neutralizing and protective human mAbs. Thus, treatment with mAbs or induction of pAbs

83

targeting this conserved region of the RBD may confer protection against many emerging SARS-

84

CoV-2 variants.

RESULTS

86

Development and characterization of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs. We generated a panel

87

of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs from BALB/c mice that were immunized and boosted with purified

88

RBD and/or ectodomain of the spike protein mixed with AddaVax™, a squalene-based adjuvant

89

(Fig 1). After splenocyte-myeloma fusions, hybridoma supernatants were screened for antibody

90

binding to recombinant spike protein and permeabilized SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells by

91

ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively. Sixty-four hybridomas producing anti-SARS-CoV-2

92

antibodies were cloned by limiting dilution. Forty-three of these mAbs bound to recombinant

93

RBD and were selected for further study because prior experiments showed this class included

94

potently inhibitory antibodies (Barnes et al., 2020; Baum et al., 2020a; Cao et al., 2020;

95

Tortorici et al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020); the majority of these mAbs were of the IgG1 subclass

96

(Fig 1).

97

The mAbs were evaluated by competition binding analysis using three previously

98

characterized human mAbs that recognize distinct antigenic sites on the RBD (COV2-2196,

99

COV2-2130, and CR3022) (Yuan et al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020) (Fig 1). Eight mAbs competed

100

for spike protein binding with the neutralizing mAb COV2-2196 only, eight mAbs competed

101

with the neutralizing mAb COV2-2130 only, four mAbs competed with both COV2-2196 and

102

COV2-2130, and twenty mAbs competed with CR3022, which recognizes a more conserved,

103

cryptic, and non-neutralizing epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein distal from the receptor

104

binding site. Three RBD-binding mAbs did not compete with COV2-2196, COV2-2130, or

105

CR3022. Based on the binding analysis, mAbs were divided into 5 competition groups, A-E (Fig

106

1).

107

One potential mechanism of antibody-mediated neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 is through

108

inhibition of viral spike protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor. The COV2-2196 epitope

109

directly overlaps the ACE2 binding site on RBD, whereas the COV2-2130 epitope lies proximal

110

to residues in the RBM that interact with ACE2 (Dong et al., 2021); nonetheless, both mAbs can

111

block spike binding to ACE2. In contrast, CR3022 engages the base of the RBD and does not

112

block ACE2 binding to spike (Yuan et al., 2020). Of the 43 RBD-binding antibodies in our

113

panel, all mAbs in groups A and B inhibited ACE2 binding to spike protein, mAbs in groups C

114

and D variably inhibited ACE2 binding, and mAbs in group E failed to inhibit ACE2 binding

115

(Fig 1).

116

The mAbs also were tested for cross-reactive binding to the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein.

117

The majority of mAbs in group D, which competed with the cross-reactive mAb CR3022 for

118

spike binding, cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-1 spike protein, indicating they bind conserved

119

sarbecovirus epitopes. MAbs in groups A, B, and C did not bind to SARS-CoV-1 (Fig 1), and

120

one group E mAb recognized SARS-CoV-1.

121

Neutralizing activity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs. We next determined the neutralizing

122

activity of mAb hybridoma supernatants using a focus-reduction neutralization test (FRNT) and

123

Vero E6 cells

124

concentrations in the supernatants were quantified by ELISA and used to calculate half-maximal

125

inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values). The most potently inhibitory mAbs (EC50: < 10

126

ng/mL) belonged to groups A, B, and C, and also blocked ACE2 binding (Fig 1). Some mAbs in

127

group C and D that did not block ACE2 binding still showed robust neutralizing activity (EC50:

128

20 – 100 ng/mL), although the majority were weakly inhibitory. Group E mAbs were weakly

129

neutralizing and did not block ACE2 binding.

130

A subset of mAbs from groups A, B, C, and D were selected for more detailed study. We

131

chose two mAbs with the highest neutralization potency from each group; in cases where mAbs

132

had high variable region sequence similarity, we selected only one of these mAbs for further

133

study. We also selected SARS2-03, as it was one of the few neutralizing mAbs that did not block

134

ACE2 binding. Nine mAbs were purified from hybridoma supernatants and retested for

135

neutralization potency by FRNT using Vero cells and the WA1/2020 isolate (Fig 2A-B). Again,

136

the most potently neutralizing purified mAbs belonged to groups A, B, and C, with less

137

inhibitory activity in those derived from group D. We also characterized these nine mAbs for

138

competition binding with each other (Fig S1). The two group A mAbs (SARS2-34 and SARS2-

139

71) competed for spike binding only with each other. In contrast, mAbs in groups B (SARS2-02

140

and SARS2-55) and C (SARS2-01 and SARS2-38) competed for spike binding across both

141

groups. SARS2-03, a group D mAb, did not bind spike efficiently in the presence of group B or

142

C mAbs and blocked binding of group C mAb SARS2-01. SARS2-10 and SARS2-31, the other

143

two group D mAbs, however, competed with only each other. Together, these results suggest that

144

mAbs in group C may have overlapping epitopes with group B mAbs and group D mAb SARS2-

145

03, whereas group A mAbs and the remaining group D mAbs likely engage physically distinct

146

epitopes.

147

Mechanism of neutralization by anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs. We investigated whether

148

the anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs inhibited infection at a pre- or post-attachment step of the entry

149

process. For these experiments, we selected one representative mAb from groups A, B, and C

150

(SARS2-34, SARS2-02, and SARS2-38, respectively) and two mAbs from group D (one that

151

blocks ACE2 binding, [SARS2-10] and one that does not [SARS2-03]). We compared the

152

neutralization potency of mAbs when added before or after virus absorption to Vero E6 cells.

153

Unexpectedly, all mAbs retained neutralizing activity when added post-attachment, although the

154

potency of groups A, B, and C mAbs SARS2-02, SARS2-34, and SARS2-38 was reduced

155

slightly (~2- to 4-fold, p < 0.05) relative to pre-attachment neutralization titers (Fig 2C-D).

156

SARS2-10, a group E mAb, also showed a ~5-fold decrease (p < 0.0001) in neutralizing activity

157

when added after attachment. In contrast, SARS2-03, another group E mAb, and the only mAb

158

in this smaller panel that did not block ACE2-spike interactions, had similar neutralization

159

potencies (p = 0.79) when added before or after cell attachment. These data suggest that mAbs

160

that inhibit spike protein binding to ACE2 neutralize SARS-CoV-2 slightly more efficiently

161

when given at a pre-attachment step, although all of the mAbs tested retained the ability to

162

inhibit infection when given after virus attachment to cells.

163

To determine the impact of entry factor expression on target cells on virus neutralization,

164

we extended these findings to cells that ectopically express human ACE2 and TMPRSS2. In

165

contrast to the relatively minor change in neutralization potency seen with all mAbs for pre-

166

versus post-attachment observed using Vero E6 cells, mAbs no longer efficiently neutralized

167

SARS-CoV-2 infection when added after attachment to Vero-TMPRSS2-ACE2 cells, although

168

pre-attachment neutralization activity remained intact (Fig 2E). Thus, the ability of anti-SARS-

169

CoV-2 mAbs to neutralize at a post-attachment step depended on expression levels of viral entry

170

factors and the cell line.

171

We also tested the ability of the mAbs to block directly virus attachment to cells,

172

including Vero E6, Vero-TMPRSS2, and Vero-TMPRSS2-ACE2 cells. None of the mAbs

173

efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 attachment to Vero or Vero-TMPRSS2 cells (Fig 2F).

174

However, with the exception of SARS2-03, all mAbs reduced virus attachment to Vero-

175

TMPRSS2-ACE2. To corroborate these findings with cells that endogenously express human

176

ACE2, we repeated experiments with Calu-3 cells, a human lung epithelial cell line. We

177

observed an intermediate phenotype with Calu-3 cells, with modest attachment inhibition by

178

mAbs in groups A, B, and C; levels of attached virus were ~25-50% lower than the isotype mAb

179

control with inhibition by only SARS2-38 attaining statistical significance (Fig 2G). This result

180

suggests that the anti-RBD mAbs can inhibit viral attachment to cells, but this activity depends

181

on levels of human ACE2 expression. Since the mAbs did not efficiently inhibit attachment to

182

Vero E6 cells lacking human ACE2 expression, we tested whether they block a later step in the

183

entry process by using a virus internalization assay (Dejarnac et al., 2018; Earnest et al., 2021).

184

In Vero E6 cells, pre-incubation with all of the anti-RBD mAbs tested resulted in reduced levels

185

of internalized virus (Fig 2H).

186

Because we observed cell type-dependent differences in the mechanism of neutralization,

187

we tested the effect of cell substrate on the inhibitory potency of our anti-RBD mAbs by FRNT.

188

Notably, the anti-RBD mAbs neutralized SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 equivalently in Vero E6,

189

Vero-TMRPSS2, and Vero-TMPRSS2-ACE2 cells (Fig S2). Thus, although the mAbs variably

190

block SARS-CoV-2 attachment on different cell types, the potency of infection inhibition was

191

similar across cell substrates. This result may be explained by the ability of anti-RBD mAbs to

192

block a required ACE2-dependent entry interaction in all of the cell substrates tested, even

193

though the attachment step is variably affected.

194

Epitope mapping of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs using neutralization escape analysis.

195

To determine spike residues important for recognition by anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs, we

196

previously isolated neutralization escape mutants by passaging a VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S

197

chimeric virus in the presence of neutralizing mAbs, including some of the antibodies described

198

in this study (Liu et al., 2021). The above described subset of nine mAbs from groups A-D were

199

tested for neutralization against the panel of sequenced mutants, with the exception of SARS2-10

200

and SARS2-03, which were not evaluated because of difficultly in isolating escape mutants with

201

mAbs of low neutralization potency. Neutralizing activity was lost for group A mAbs SARS2-34

202

and SARS2-71 when residues 476-479, 486, and 499 were mutated; for group B mAbs SARS2-

203

02 and SARS2-55 when residues 446, 452, and 484 were mutated; for group C mAb SARS2-01

204

when residues 346, 352, 446, 450, and 494 were mutated; for group C mAb SARS2-38 when

205

residues 444 and 446 were mutated; and for group D mAb SARS2-31 when residues 378, 408,

206

and 504 were mutated (Fig 3A-F).

207

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs protect against virus challenge in vivo. We next tested the

208

anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs for protection against the historical SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 virus in

209

vivo. Eight- to ten-week-old K18 human ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic mice were administered a

210

single 100 µg dose (~5 mg/kg) of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb 24 h prior to intranasal inoculation

211

with 103 FFU of SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020. Mice treated with the isotype control mAb lost up to

212

25% body weight by 7 days post-infection (dpi), the designated endpoint of the study (Fig 4A).

213

Mice treated with group A mAbs SARS2-71 and SARS2-34 maintained body weight until 6-7

214

dpi, at which point we observed a 10% weight loss (Fig 4A). Mice treated with group B mAbs

215

SARS2-02 and SARS2-55 and group C mAbs SARS2-01 and SARS2-38 all maintained body

216

weight throughout the experiment (Fig 4B-C). Animals treated with group D mAbs SARS2-10,

217

SARS2-31 or SARS2-03 generally were less protected against virus-induced weight loss (Fig

218

4D).

219

To corroborate these findings, we measured the effect of mAb treatment on viral burden

220

in the nasal washes and lungs on 7 dpi. The greatest decreases in viral RNA levels (~30 to 100-

221

fold) in the nasal washes relative to isotype control mAb-treated mice were observed in animals

222

treated with mAbs in group B (SARS2-02 and SARS2-55) and group C (SARS2-01 and SARS2-

223

38) (Fig 4E). The largest reductions in viral RNA levels in the lung (~100 to 1,000-fold) again

224

were observed for mice treated with mAbs in group B (SARS2-02 and SARS2-55) and group C

225

(SARS2-38) (Fig 4F). A smaller (~10-fold) decrement of virus RNA levels in the lung was

226

observed for group C mAb SARS2-03. We also measured effects on infectious viral load in the

227

lung by plaque assay for a subset of representative mAbs from each group. Whereas group A

228

mAb SARS2-71 did not decrease the number of plaque-forming units (PFU) in the lung relative

229

to the isotype control mAb-treated mice, SARS2-02, SARS2-38, and SARS2-03 all reduced

230

infectious virus levels in the lung to the limit of detection of the assay (Fig 4G). The lack of

231

protection conferred by SARS2-71 in vivo was unanticipated given its potent neutralizing

232

activity in cell culture (EC50 of 8 ng/mL, Fig 2). Sequencing of viral RNA from the lungs of

233

SARS2-71-treated mice at 7 dpi revealed an S477N mutation in the RBD in all samples, which

234

was not present in the input WA1/2020 virus. Notably, S477N also emerged in vitro as an escape

235

mutant under SARS2-71 selection pressure using the VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S virus (Fig

236

3A). Thus, despite its potent inhibitory activity in vitro, SARS2-71 likely failed to protect in vivo

237

because of rapid emergence of a fully pathogenic escape mutant.

238

To evaluate further the level of protection conferred by a subset of mAbs in our panel, we

239

measured levels of cytokines and chemokines in lung tissues at 7 dpi, which are markers of the

240

inflammatory and pathological outcomes in this mouse model (Golden et al., 2020; Oladunni et

241

242

in substantially reduced cytokine and chemokine levels relative to isotype control mAb-treated

243

mice, with levels equivalent to those seen in naïve mice (Fig S3). In contrast, treatment with

244

SARS2-71 and SARS2-03 did not result in these reductions, with cytokine and chemokine levels

245

similar to isotype-control treated and infected mice.

246

To test for post-exposure therapeutic protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, we

247

cloned the variable regions of group B mAb SARS2-02 and group C mAb SARS2-38 and

248

inserted them into a human IgG1 backbone to make chimeric antibodies. We did this since

249

chimeric, humanized, or fully-human mAbs are more likely to be used in humans, and because

250

Fc effector functions contribute to the therapeutic activity of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 mAbs in

251

vivo (Winkler et al., 2021); the original murine IgG1 isotype of these mAbs binds poorly to the

252

activating murine FcγRI and FcγRIV, whereas human IgG1 binds these murine Fc receptors with

253

higher affinity and thus could have enhanced effector function (Dekkers et al., 2017). We

254

confirmed the neutralizing activity of the chimeric mAbs hSARS2-02 and hSARS-38 relative to

255

the original murine IgG1 versions of the mAbs (Fig S4). Next, we inoculated K18-hACE2 mice

256

with 103 FFU of SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020. Twenty-four hours later, we administered a single

257

200 µg (10 mg/kg) dose of hSARS2-02, hSARS2-38, or an isotype control mAb. Both hSARS2-

258

02 and hSARS2-38 protected against weight loss following infection (Fig 4H). At 7 dpi,

259

hSARS2-38 reduced viral RNA levels in the lung and heart by ~10,000-fold, whereas hSARS2-

260

02 reduced infection by only ~10-100 fold in these tissues (Fig 4I).

261

Neutralization of variants of concern by anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs. We tested the two

262

mAbs (SARS2-02 and SARS2-38) that conferred the greatest protection against WA1/2020 in

263

vivo for neutralization of viruses with spike proteins corresponding to circulating variants of

264

concern (VOCs). Recombinant chimeric WA1/2020 viruses encoding the spike protein from

265

B.1.351 or B.1.1.28 were utilized for these studies (Wash-1.351 and Wash-1.1.28), as well as

266

WA1/2020 with an introduced D614G mutation; we also tested viral isolates B.1.1.7, B.1.429,

267

B.1.1.298, and B.1.222. Several of these VOCs encode amino acid changes in spike that can

268

affect mAb binding (Fig 5A) (Chen et al., 2021d; Shen et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021), including

269

changes we identified in our VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S escape mutant panel: L452R and

270

E484K both showed reduced sensitivity to neutralization of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S by

271

group B mAbs SARS2-02 and SARS2-55. Indeed, SARS2-02 exhibited reduced (~50-100-fold)

272

neutralizing activity against authentic SARS-CoV-2 strains with E484K (Wash-B.1.351 and

273

Wash-B.1.1.28) or L452R (B.1.429) substitutions (Fig 5B and C). Notably, SARS2-38 did not

274

lose potency against any of the variant viruses, with EC50 values ranging from 1-4 ng/mL across

275

the panel tested (Fig 5D and E).

276

To expand on this analysis, we tested the VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S viruses that were

277

resistant to SARS2-02 and SARS2-38 for neutralization using full dose response curves analysis.

278

SARS2-02 showed ~20-fold reduced potency against E484K, ~100-fold reduced potency against

279

L452R and G446V, and did not neutralize G446D at the highest concentration of mAb tested

280

(Fig 5F). SARS2-38 showed virtually no neutralizing activity against K444E, K444N, G446D,

281

or G446V mutants even at the highest concentration (1 μg/ml) of mAb tested (Fig 5G). Despite

282

these results with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S viruses, when we serially passaged authentic

283

WA1/2020 D614G or Wash-B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-TMPRSS2-ACE2 cells in the

284

presence of neutralizing mAbs, we readily isolated resistant viruses following SARS-02 but not

285

SARS2-38 selection with both strains.

286

We tested SARS2-02 and SARS2-38 for protection against Wash-B.1.351 in K18-hACE2

287

mice. Animals treated with 100 µg of either SARS2-02 or SARS2-38 24 h prior to infection were

288

protected from weight loss (Fig 5H), despite the reduced neutralization potency of SARS2-02

289

against Wash B.1.351. SARS2-38 treatment greatly reduced viral titers in the lung, nasal washes,

290

heart, and brain at 7 dpi compared to the isotype control-treated mice, whereas SARS2-02 had

291

less of a protective effect (Fig 5I). When hSARS2-02 and hSARS2-38 were administered to the

292

K18-hACE2 transgenic mice as therapy 24 h after infection with Wash-B.1.351, a similar

293

phenotype was observed: while they both protected mice against weight loss (Fig 5J), hSARS2-

294

38 resulted in a greater reduction in viral titers at 7 dpi in the lung, heart, and brain than

295

hSARS2-02 (Fig 5K).

296

SARS2-38 targets the proximal RBM ridge with extensive light chain contact. To

297

define further the mechanistic basis for the broad and potent neutralization by SARS2-38, we

298

first analyzed the interaction of antigen binding fragments (Fab) of SARS2-38 with SARS-CoV-

299

2 spike using biolayer interferometry (BLI). SARS2-38 bound spike with high monovalent

300

affinity (kinetically derived KD of 6.5 nM) and had a half-life of 4.8 min (Fig S5A). To

301

understand the basis for this binding structurally, we performed cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-

302

EM) on complexes of SARS2-38 Fab and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Fig S5B). We

303

generated three-dimensional classes to sample the conformational landscape of the Fab/spike

304

complex, and the class of highest resolution was refined further. This class consisted of trimeric

305

spike with all RBDs in the down position (D/D/D) and one RBD bound by Fab (Fig 6A and

306

S6A-B). Using non-uniform refinement, we achieved an overall resolution of 3.20 Å, with local

307

resolution ranging from ~2.5 Å in the core of the spike to ~5.5 Å in the constant region of the

308

Fab, which was visible only at high contour (Fig S6B-D). Other binding configurations also were

309

seen, the most predominant consisting of spike with one RBD up and two RBDs down (U/D/D),

310

with only the up RBD bound by Fab (31.1%). Less frequently, all three RBDs were bound by

311

Fab in the U/D/D conformation (22.0%; Fig S5B). Although SARS2-38 could bind SARS-CoV-

312

2 spike with full occupancy, 61.1% of spike trimers were bound only by a single Fab molecule.

313

To improve resolution at the Fab/RBD interface in the D/D/D reconstruction, we

314

performed a focused, local refinement of the SARS2-38 variable domain (Fv) and RBD,

315

excluding the rest of the spike and the constant region of the Fab. This reconstruction of the

316

Fv/RBD complex achieved a resolution of 3.16 Å, allowing unambiguous placement of the

317

protein backbone, secondary structures, and most side chains at the interface (Fig S5B and S6E-

318

F). The SARS2-38 Fv sits atop three loops protruding at the proximal end of the RBM between

319

helix α1 and strand β1 (contact residues T345-R346), strands β4 and β5 (N439-G446, N448-

320

Y451), and strand β6 and helix α5 (S494 and Q498-T500; Fig 6A-B); these results correspond

321

well with our VSV-based escape mutant mapping (Fig 3). All three light chain CDRs contact

322

loop β4-β5, with CDR2 and CDR3 forming additional contacts with loops α1-β1 and β6-α5,

323

respectively. In comparison, the heavy chain interacts in a more limited manner with loops β4-β5

324

and β6-α5 via CDR2 and CDR3. CDR1 of the heavy chain makes no contact at all with the RBD.

325

The heavy chain does, however, engage ACE2 contact residues of the RBM (Fig 6A, right

326

panel). This and other steric effects likely explain the inhibition of ACE2 binding by SARS2-38.

327

The SARS2-38 epitope is conserved among circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of

328

concern. SARS2-38 potently neutralized all tested VOCs. To understand this broadly-

329

neutralizing activity, we mapped the SARS2-38 epitope alongside VOC mutations within the

330

RBD (Fig 6B, left panel and Fig 6C). One mutation in the SARS2-38 footprint, N439K, is

331

present in variant B.1.222 and resides at the periphery of the epitope. However, B.1.222

332

remained sensitive to neutralization by SARS2-38, and escape mutants at this residue were not

333

generated in vitro, suggesting that N439 is not critical for SARS2-38 binding. The SARS2-38

334

epitope includes no other residues corresponding to VOC mutations, which explains its

335

performance against these variants. Notwithstanding this, we could select escape mutations in

15

336

vitro in the context of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S chimeric virus, namely K444E/N and

337

G446D/V substitutions, which reside on the β4-β5 loop central to the SARS2-38 epitope (Fig

338

6B-C). The substitutions generated at K444 result in a loss of positive charge (K444N) or charge

339

reversal (K444E), whereas the mutation at G446 may distort the entire loop structure; in our

340

model, G446 adopts a stereochemistry unique to the glycine residue (φ = 108° and ψ = -19°).

341

This structural analysis likely explains the resistance conferred by these amino acid substitutions.

342

To understand the efficacy of SARS2-38 amidst the landscape of all circulating variants,

343

we used the COVID-19 CoV Genetics Browser (covidcg.org) to probe RBD sequences in the

344

GISAID database (786,273 isolates as of March 28, 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Shu et al., 2017).

345

We then developed a log-scale conservation score for RBD residues 333-520. In this model,

346

perfect conservation of the reference amino acid (from 2019n-CoV/WA1/2020) across all

347

isolates corresponds to a score of 1, and complete loss of the reference amino acid results in a

348

score of 0. Visualizing these scores on a color-coded RBD surface rendering (blue = 1, more

349

conserved; red = 0, more variable) revealed that the RBM is generally more variable than the rest

350

of the RBD, with VOCs clearly seen as red patches (Fig 6B, right panel). This analysis also

351

suggested that in addition to not being affected by the VOCs tested in this study, SARS2-38

352

targets a portion of the RBM that is conserved among circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. The

353

positions at which we identified escape mutants using VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S chimeric

354

viruses were substituted in only 0.02% (K444) and 0.04% (G444) of isolates, with the specific

355

escape mutations (K444E/N and G446D/V) observed in only 0.007% and 0.03% of isolates

356

respectively. Overall, 99.96% of isolates lacked the escape mutations for SARS2-38 identified in

357

our study.

DISCUSSION

360

In this study, we describe and characterize extensively a panel of mAbs that bind the

361

RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Several anti-RBD mAbs protected in vivo against

362

SARS-CoV-2 infection in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. While the less potently neutralizing

363

mAbs directed against epitopes on the base of RBD (SARS2-10, SARS2-31, and SARS2-03)

364

exhibited diminished protection against weight loss, induction of inflammatory cytokines and

365

chemokines in the lung, and viral infection in the lung and nasal wash than mAbs recognizing

366

the RBM, neutralization potency was not the only predictor of in vivo efficacy. Indeed, SARS2-

367

71 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with a potency similar to that of protective mAbs SARS2-02 and

368

SARS2-38, yet failed to confer protection in mice. Notwithstanding this result, antibodies

369

targeting proximal competing epitopes as SARS2-71, such as COV2-2196, have been shown to

370

confer protection in vivo (Zost et al., 2020). The failure of SARS2-71 to protect in particular is

371

likely due to the emergence of the escape variant S477N in vivo. This finding demonstrates that

372

SARS-CoV-2 can rapidly escape from mAb inhibition in vivo, and that mAb or mAb cocktails

373

that prevent or limit rapid escape mutant generation likely will have greater therapeutic utility.

374

While currently authorized mAb treatments include cocktails, the emergence of VOCs that are

375

resistant to one or both component mAbs could compromise drug efficacy.

376

The most potently inhibitory mAbs in our panel bind epitopes within or proximal to the

377

RBM and inhibit spike interaction with human ACE2 by ELISA, as observed for other anti-

378

SARS-CoV-2 mAbs (Zost et al., 2020). Several of these mAbs inhibited viral attachment to

379

Calu-3 and Vero-TMPRSS2-ACE2 cells, but not to Vero E6 cells or Vero-TMPRSS2 cells.

380

Infection of Vero E6 cells by SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on endogenous levels of monkey ACE2

381

expression, as pretreatment with anti-ACE2 mAbs inhibits infection (Hoffmann et al., 2020).

382

However, other host factors such as heparan sulfate also can mediate virus attachment to cells

383

(Chu et al., 2021; Clausen et al., 2020). If binding to other cell surface ligands occurs prior to the

384

RBD-ACE2 interaction, mAbs that block ACE2 binding may not efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV-

385

2 attachment, but instead block a downstream ACE2-dependent entry step. This idea is supported

386

by our data showing that several neutralizing mAbs block viral internalization in Vero E6 cells.

387

Moreover, anti-RBD mAbs have only moderate decreases in neutralization potency when added

388

after virus absorption to Vero E6 cells. In contrast, when SARS-CoV-2 attaches to the cell

389

surface via human ACE2 interaction, such as in Vero-TMPRSS2-ACE2 cells, the addition of

390

anti-RBD mAbs after attachment failed to neutralize virus infection. A higher density of ACE2

391

or higher affinity of spike protein for human ACE2 (relative to monkey ACE2) on the Vero-

392

TMPRSS2-ACE2 cells may drive initial virus attachment through the RBD-ACE2 interaction

393

and explain why mAbs can block this step in these cells. Together, these data suggest that the

394

ability of anti-RBD mAbs to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 attachment depends on cellular ACE2

395

expression levels and thus can be cell-type dependent. As these mechanistic differences did not

396

markedly affect mAb potency on the different cellular substrates, we conclude that in the cells

397

we tested there is a required entry interaction with ACE2 either at attachment, post-attachment,

398

or internalization steps.

399

Several mutations and deletions in emerging VOCs occur in the NTD and RBD that

400

allow them to avoid antibody recognition, including RBD mutations K417N/T (B.1.351 and

401

B.1.1.28), N439K (B.1.222), L452R (B.1.429), Y453R (B.1.1.298), E484K (B.1.351 and

402

B.1.1.28), and N501Y (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.1.28) (reviewed by (Plante et al., 2021)),

403

highlighting the importance of developing mAbs against a variety of spatially distinct epitopes.

404

In our panel, SARS2-38 potently neutralized viruses encoding any of the above mutations, did

405

not readily select for escape mutations with authentic SARS-CoV-2 strains, and retained

406

therapeutic activity in vivo against a virus containing substitutions of one of the key VOCs

407

(B.1.351). Moreover, functional mapping and structural analysis of the binding footprint of

408

SARS-CoV-2 defined a conserved RBD epitope that could be recognized by other potently

409

neutralizing and protective human mAbs.

410

Relatively few antibodies targeting similar epitopes to SARS2-38 have been described,

411

and those characterized bind the RBD in distinct orientations with heavy chain predominance

412

(Fig 7A). These include murine mAb 2H04, as well as human mAbs REGN10987, COV2-2130,

413

and, though less similar, S309 (Dong et al., 2021; Hansen et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Pinto et

414

al., 2020). SARS2-38 differs in two respects: (a) the baseline neutralizing activity of SARS2-38

415

against WA1/2020 in Vero cells (EC50, ~5 ng/mL) is 30-fold, 20-fold, and 16-fold more potent

416

than that of 2H04, COV2-2130, and S309, respectively (Alsoussi et al., 2020; Pinto et al., 2020;

417

Zost et al., 2020); and (b) SARS2-38 retains strong neutralization potency against all VOCs

418

evaluated in this study, whereas the inhibitory activity 2H04, COV2-2130, and S309 is reduced

419

somewhat against B.1.1.7, B.1.429, and B.1.351, respectively ((Chen et al., 2021c; Chen et al.,

420

2021d) and R.E.C. and M.S.D. unpublished results). Similarly, REGN10987 exhibited a 10-fold

421

reduction in neutralizing activity against B.1.429 compared to WA1/2020 (Chen et al., 2021c;

422

Hansen et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). A structural examination of these other antibody

423

footprints within the context of VOC mutations does not provide a direct explanation for some of

424

the resistance (Fig 7B). Instead, allostery may play a role. Whereas other broadly and potently

425

neutralizing mAbs (including mAbs 2C08, COV2-2196, 58G6, 510A5, and S2X259) have been

426

reported that bind RBD epitopes at residues G476, F486, and N487, or loops near residues 369-

427

386, 404-411, 450-458, and 499-508 (Dong et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Schmitz et al., 2021;

428

Tortorici et al., 2021), SARS2-38 targets a distinct epitope proximal to the RBM and has been

429

evaluated functionally against a larger panel of authentic viruses containing sequences

430

corresponding to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

431

In summary, we have characterized a panel of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs, defined their

432

cellular mechanism of action in different cells, tested in vitro neutralizing and in vivo protection

433

capacity against historical and circulating variants, and determined the structure of the viral spike

434

protein bound to SARS2-38, a potently and broadly neutralizing mAb that recognizes emerging

435

VOCs. A humanized version of SARS2-38 confers therapeutic protection against the WA1/2020

436

isolate and a SARS-CoV-2 strain expressing the spike protein of B.1.351. The conserved epitope

437

bound by SARS2-38 thus may be a potential target for antibodies with therapeutic potential or

438

that are induced by effective vaccines with more limited potential for resistance against VOCs.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

626

Viruses. The 2019n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020 (WA1/2020) isolate of SARS-CoV-2 was

627

obtained from the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC). WA1/2020 stocks were propagated on

628

Vero CCL81 cells and used at passage 6 and 7. Viral titer was determined by focus-forming

629

assay (FFA) on Vero E6 cells as described (Case et al., 2020). The D614G virus was produced

630

by introducing the mutation into an infectious clone of WA1/2020, and the B.1.351 and B.1.1.28

631

Spike genes were cloned into the WA1/2020 infectious clone to produce Wash-B.1.351 and

632

Wash-B.1.1.28 chimeric viruses, as described previously (Chen et al., 2021d). The B.1.1.7,

633

B.1.429, B.1.298, and B.1.222 isolates were isolated from infected individuals. Viruses were

634

propagated on Vero-TMPRSS2 cells and subjected to deep sequencing to confirm the presence

635

of the substitutions indicated in Fig 5A.

636

Cells. Cell lines were maintained at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2. Vero E6 cells were

637

passaged in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%

638

fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Omega Scientific) and 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin (P/S)

639

(Invitrogen). Vero cells that over-express TMPRSS2 or TMPRSS2-ACE2 were maintained as

640

Vero CCL81 cells, with the addition of 5 µg/mL blasticidin (Vero-TMPRSS2) or 10 µg/mL

641

puromycin (Vero-TMPRSS2-ACE2). Calu-3 cells were maintained in DMEM with 20% FBS

642

and 100 U/mL P/S.

643

Proteins. Genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (residues 1-1213, GenBank:

644

MN908947.3) and RBD (residues 319-514) were cloned into a pCAGGS mammalian expression

645

vector with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. The spike protein was prefusion stabilized and

646

expression optimized via six proline substitutions (F817P, A892P, A899P, A942P, K986P,

647

V987P) (Hsieh et al., 2020), with a disrupted S1/S2 furin cleavage site and a C-terminal foldon

648

trimerization motif (YIPEAPRDGQAYVRKDGEWVLLSTFL). Expi293F cells were transiently

649

transfected, and proteins were recovered via cobalt-charged resin chromatography (G-

650

Biosciences) as previously described (Alsoussi et al., 2020; Hassan et al., 2020). For ACE2

651

binding inhibition analysis, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was made by synthesizing a gene

652

encoding the ectodomain of a prefusion conformation-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike (S6Pecto)

653

protein (Hsieh et al., 2020) containing C-terminal Twin-Strep-tag. The spike gene was then

654

cloned it into a DNA plasmid expression vector for mammalian cells. Protein was produced in

655

FreeStyle 293-F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and purified from culture supernatants using

656

StrepTrap HP affinity column (Cytiva).

657

Mice. Animal studies were carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the

658

Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The

protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Washington

660

University School of Medicine (Assurance number A3381-01). Virus inoculations were

661

performed under anesthesia that was induced and maintained with ketamine hydrochloride and

662

xylazine, and all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering.

663

K18-hACE2 transgenic mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (#034860) and

664

housed in a pathogen-free animal facility at Washington University in St. Louis. For passive

665

transfer studies, mAbs were diluted in PBS and administered to mice via intraperitoneal injection

666

in a 100 µL total volume. Viral infections were performed via intranasal inoculation with 103

667

FFU of virus. Mice were monitored daily for weight loss.

METHOD DETAILS

670

MAb generation. BALB/c mice were immunized with 10 µg of SARS-CoV-2 RBD

671

adjuvanted with 50% AddaVax™ (InvivoGen), via intramuscular route (i.m.), followed by i.m.

672

immunization two and four weeks later with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (5 µg and 10 µg,

673

respectively) supplemented with AddaVax™. Mice received a final, non-adjuvanted boost of 25

674

µg of SARS-CoV-2 spike or RBD (12.5 µg intravenously and 12.5 µg interperitoneally) 3 days

675

prior to fusion of splenocytes with P3X63.Ag.6.5.3 myeloma cells. Hybridomas producing

676

antibodies that bound to SARS-CoV-2-infected permeabilized Vero CCL81 cells by flow

677

cytometry and to SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein by direct ELISA were cloned by

678

limiting dilution. All hybridomas were screened initially with a single-endpoint neutralization

679

assay using hybridoma supernatant diluted 1:3 and incubated with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at 37°C

680

prior to addition to Vero E6 cells. Following a 30-h incubation, cells were fixed, permeabilized,

681

and stained for SARS-CoV-2 infection with CR3022 as described (Case et al., 2020). A subset of

2 N H2SO4 and measuring OD 450 nm. Antibody concentrations in hybridoma supernatant were

705

interpolated from a standard curve produced using an isotype control mAb.

706

Spike and RBD binding analysis. 96-well Maxisorp plates were coated with 2 µg/mL of

707

SARS-CoV-2 spike or RBD protein in 50mM Na2CO3 (70μL) overnight at 4°C. Plates

708

were washed three times with PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 and blocked with 200 μL of PBS + 0.05%

709

Tween-20 + 1% BSA + 0.02% NaN3 for 2 h at room temperature. 75 μL of blocking buffer and

710

50 μL of hybridoma supernatant were combined, and 50μL/well of diluted supernatants were

711

added to the plates and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Bound IgG was detected using

712

HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (at 1:2,000). Following a 1 h incubation, washed plates

713

were developed with 50 μL of 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA, quenched with 2 N H2SO4, and the

714

absorbance was read at 450nm.

715

Competition binding analysis. The assay was performed as described previously (Zost

716

et al., 2020). Briefly, for screening study wells of 384-well microtiter plates were coated with 1

717

μg/mL of purified SARS-CoV-2 S6Pecto protein at 4°C overnight. Plates were blocked with 2%

718

bovine serum albumin (BSA) in DPBS-T for 1 h. Mouse hybridoma culture supernatants were

719

diluted five-fold in blocking buffer, added to the wells (20 μl per well) in duplicates for each

720

tested reference mAb and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Biotinylated reference human

721

mAbs with known epitope specificity (COV2-2130, COV2-2196 (Zost et al., 2020), and CR3022

722

(ter Meulen et al., 2006)) were added to each of well with the respective hybridoma culture

723

supernatant at 1.25 μg/mL in a volume of 5 μl per well (final concentration of biotinylated mAb,

724

0.25 μg/mL) without washing of the plates, and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature.

725

Plates then were washed, and bound antibodies were detected using HRP-conjugated avidin

726

(Sigma, A3151, 0.3 μg/mL final concentration) and a TMB substrate. The signal obtained for

727

binding of the biotin-labelled reference antibody in the presence of the hybridoma culture

728

supernatant was expressed as a percentage of the binding of the reference antibody alone after

729

subtracting the background signal. Tested mAbs were considered competing if their presence

730

reduced the reference antibody binding to less than 41% of its maximal binding and non-

731

competing if the signal was greater than 71%. A level of 40–70% was considered intermediate

732

competition.

733

Human ACE2 binding inhibition analysis. The assay was performed as described

734

previously (Zost et al., 2020). Briefly, for screening study wells of 384-well microtiter plates

735

were coated with 1 μg/mL purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S6Pecto protein at 4°C overnight.

736

Plates were blocked with 2% non-fat dry milk and 2% normal goat serum in DPBS-T for 1 h.

737

Mouse hybridoma culture supernatants were diluted five-fold in blocking buffer, added to the

738

wells (20 μl per well) in quadruplicate, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Recombinant

739

human ACE2 with a C-terminal Flag tag peptide was added to wells at 2 μg/mL in a 5 μl per

740

well volume (final 0.4 μg/mL concentration of human ACE2) without washing of the plates, and

741

then incubated for 40 min at room temperature. Plates were washed and bound human ACE2 was

742

detected using HRP-conjugated anti-Flag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, A8592, 1:5,000 dilution) and

743

TMB substrate. ACE2 binding without antibody served as a control for maximal binding.

744

Antibody COV2-2196 (RBD) served as a control for ACE2 binding inhibition. The signal

745

obtained for binding of the human ACE2 in the presence of each dilution of tested culture

746

supernatant was expressed as a percentage of the human ACE2 binding without antibody after

747

subtracting the background signal.

purification with Direct-Zol Micro kit (Zymo). 5' RACE products were generated with Template

751

Switching RT Enzyme Mix (New England Biolabs) using anchored poly(dT)23 and TSO (GCT

752

AAT CAT TGC AAG CAG TGG TAT CAA CGC AGA GTA CAT rGrGrG) oligonucleotides

753

according to the manufactures instructions. Heavy and light chain sequences were amplified with

754

primers specific for the TSO handle-sequence and the respective constant region sequence with

755

Q5 Polymerase (New England Biolabs). Following Sanger sequencing, full-length variable

756

regions were synthesized as gene blocks (Integrated DNA Technologies) and cloned into hIgG1

757

and hKappa expression vectors by Gibson assembly. Recombinant antibodies were expressed in

758

Expi293 cells following co-transfection of heavy and light chain plasmids (1:1 ratio) using

759

Expifectamine 293 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Supernatants were harvested after 5-6 days,

760

purified by affinity chromatography (Protein A Sepharose, GE), and desalted with a PD-10

761

(Cytiva) column.

762

Binding analysis via biolayer interferometry. Biolayer interferometry (BLI) was used

763

to quantify the binding capacity of SARS2-38 Fab fragments to trimerized SARS-CoV-2 spike.

764

10 µg/mL of biotinylated spike was immobilized onto streptavidin biosensors (ForteBio) for 3

765

min. After a 30 sec wash, the pins were submerged in running buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM

766

NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% P20 surfactant, and 1% BSA) containing SARS2-38 Fab ranging

767

from 1 to 1,000 nM, followed by a dissociation step in running buffer alone. The BLI signal was

768

recorded and analyzed using BIAevaluation Software (Biacore).

769

Cryo-EM sample preparation. Data were collected on lacey carbon grids with or

770

without ultra-thin carbon film. For standard lacey carbon grids (Ted Pella #01895-F), SARS-

771

CoV-2 spike was prepared at 1 mg/mL in TBS (30mM Tris pH 8, 150mM NaCl). For lacey

772

carbon grids with ultra-thin carbon film (Ted Pella #01824G), SARS-CoV-2 spike was prepared

773

at 0.2 mg/mL in TBS. Each sample was incubated for 15 min with 1 molar equivalent of SARS2-

774

38 Fab fragments, applied to glow-discharged grids, then flash-frozen in liquid ethane using a

775

Vitrobot Mark IV (ThermoFisher Scientific).

776

Cryo-EM data collection. Grids were loaded into a Cs-corrected FEI Titan Krios 300kV

777

microscope equipped with a Falcon 4 direct electron detector. Images were collected at a

778

nominal magnification of 59000x, resulting in a pixel size of 1.16Å. Each movie consisted of 50

779

frames at 260ms each with a dose of 1e-/Å2/frame, yielding a total dose of 50e-/Å2/movie.

780

Cryo-EM data processing. Movies were motion corrected using MotionCor2 v1.3.1

781

(Zheng et al., 2017), and contrast transfer function parameters were estimated using GCTF v1.18

782

(Zhang, 2016). Particles were picked using a general model in CrYOLO v1.7.6 (Wagner et al.,

783

2019). 2D classification was performed in Relion 3.1 (Scheres, 2012; Zivanov et al., 2018), and

784

particles in good classes from grids with or without ultra-thin carbon were combined for further

785

processing. These particles were subjected to 3D classification, and those from the best class (all

786

RBDs in the down position, with one bound by Fab) were selected for iterative Bayesian

787

polishing and per-particle CTF refinement in Relion 3.1 (Zivanov et al., 2019). These particles

788

were then used in non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC v3.1.0 to generate a full-spike map

789

(Punjani et al., 2017). To improve map quality at the Fab/spike interface, a mask was generated

790

encompassing only the Fv and RBD, and particles were subjected to local non-uniform

791

refinement in cryoSPARC v3.1.0. Final maps were sharpened via deep learning employed

792

through DeepEMhancer (Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2020).

793

Model building. The locally refined map was used to construct a model of the RBD

794

bound by SARS2-38 Fv. An initial model for the RBD was adapted from a crystal structure of

795

RBD bound to ACE2 (PDB 6M0J). For initial modeling of SARS2-38 Fv, pBLAST was used to

796

identify pre-existing Fab structures with high sequence similarity (PDB 1KIQ for VH, and PDB

797

5XJM for VL). These starting components were combined and docked into the map, then refined

798

in Coot v0.9.5 (Emsley et al., 2010), Isolde v1.1.0 (Croll, 2018), and Phenix v1.19 (Adams et al.,

799

2010). Epitope and paratope contacts were identified using qtPISA (Krissinel and Henrick,

800

2007), and structures were visualized using UCSF ChimeraX (Goddard et al., 2018).

801

The full-spike map was used to construct a model of the spike bound by one Fv with all

802

RBDs in the down position. An initial model was generated by combining the locally refined

803

Fv/RBD structure with a previously solved cryo-EM structure of trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike in

804

the proper RBD configuration (PDB 6VXX). This model was docked into the full-spike map

805

then refined using Coot v0.9.5, Isolde v1.1.0, and Phenix v1.19.

806

RBD conservation analysis. RBD sequence data (residues 333-520) were retrieved on

807

March 28, 2021 from the COVID-19 CoV Genetics Browser (covidcg.org), enabled by data from

808

GISAID (Chen et al., 2021a; Shu and McCauley, 2017). In total, 786,273 sequences were

809

included in the analysis. Probability of conservation relative to the reference sequence (2019n-

810

CoV/WA1/2020) was computed for each residue, and results were log-transformed and

811

normalized to generate a per-residue conservation score (1 = complete conservation, 0 = zero

812

conservation). Results were visualized using a color-coded surface rendering of the RBD in

813

UCSF ChimeraX.

814

Neutralization assays. FRNTs were performed as described (Case et al., 2020). Briefly,

815

serial dilutions of antibody were incubated with 2 x 102 FFU of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at 37°C.

816

Immune complexes were added to cell monolayers (Vero E6 cells or other cell lines where

817

indicated) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C prior to the addition of 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in

818

MEM. Following incubation for 30 h at 37°C, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde

(PFA), permeabilized and stained for infection foci with SARS2-16 (hybridoma supernatant

820

diluted 1:6,000 to a final concentration of ~20 ng/mL) when using SARS-CoV-2 isolate

821

WA1/2020, or with a mixture of mAbs that bind various epitopes on the RBD and NTD of spike

822

(SARS2-02, SARS2-11, SARS2-31, SARS2-38, SARS2-57, and SARS2-71; diluted to 1 µg/mL

823

total mAb concentration) for the VOCs. Antibody-dose response curves were analyzed using

824

non-linear regression analysis (with a variable slope) (GraphPad Software). The antibody half-

825

maximal inhibitory concentration (EC50) required to reduce infection was determined.

826

Pre- and post-attachment neutralization assays. For pre-attachment assays, serial

827

dilutions of mAbs were prepared at 4°C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with

828

2% FBS and preincubated with 102 FFU of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at 4°C. MAb-virus complexes

829

were added to a monolayer of Vero cells for 1 h at 4°C. Virus was allowed to internalize during a

830

37°C incubation for 30 min. Cells were overlaid with 1% (wt/vol) methylcellulose in MEM. For

831

post-attachment assays, 2 x 102 FFU of SARS-CoV-2 was adsorbed onto a monolayer of Vero

832

cells for 1 h at 4°C. After removal of unbound virus, cells were washed twice with cold DMEM,

833

followed by the addition of serial dilutions of MAbs in cold DMEM. Virus-adsorbed cells were

834

incubated with mAd dilutions for 1 h at 4°C. Virus then was allowed to internalize for 30 min at

835

37°C, and subsequently cells were overlaid with methylcellulose as described above. Thirty

836

hours later, plates were fixed with 4% PFA and analyzed for antigen-specific foci as described

837

above for FRNTs.

838

Attachment inhibition assay. SARS-COV-2 was incubated with mAbs at 10 µg/mL for

839

1 h at 4°C. The mixture then was added to pre-chilled Vero E6, Vero-TMPRSS2, Vero-

840

TMPRSS2-ACE2, or Calu-3 cells at an MOI of 0.005 and incubated at 4°C for 1 h. Cells were

841

washed six times with chilled PBS before addition of lysis buffer and extraction of RNA using

842

MagMax viral RNA isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a Kingfisher Flex 96-well

843

extraction machine (Thermo Fisher Scientific). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was quantified by qRT-PCR

844

using the N-specific primer/probe set described below. GAPDH was measured using a

845

predesigned primer/probe set (IDT PrimeTime Assay Hs.PT.39a.22214836). Viral RNA levels

846

were normalized to GAPDH, and the fold change was compared with isotype control mAb. For

847

each cell type, a control with a 4-fold lower MOI (0.00125) was included to demonstrate

848

detection of decreased viral RNA levels.

849

Virus internalization assay. SARS-COV-2 was incubated with mAbs at 10 µg/mL for 1

850

h at 4°C. The mixture was then added to pre-chilled Vero E6 cells at an MOI of 0.005 and

851

incubated at 4°C for 1 h. Cells were washed twice with chilled PBS to remove unbound virus,

852

and subsequently incubated in DMEM at 37°C for 30 min to allow virus internalization. Cells

853

then were treated with proteinase K and RNaseA at 37°C for 10 min to removed uninternalized

854

virus. Viral and cellular RNA were extracted and analyzed as described above for the attachment

855

inhibition assay. A no internalization control was included, where proteinase K and RNase A

856

treatments were performed directly after washing, without an internalization step.

857

Measurement of viral burden and cytokine and chemokine levels. On 7 dpi, mice

858

were euthanized and organs were collected. Nasal washes were collected in 0.5 mL of PBS.

859

Organs were weighed and homogenized using a MagNA Lyser (Roche). Viral RNA from

860

homogenized organs or nasal wash was isolated using the MagMAX Viral RNA Isolation Kit

861

(ThermoFisher) and measured by TaqMan one-step quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-

862

qPCR) on an ABI 7500 Fast Instrument. Viral burden is expressed on a log10 scale as viral RNA
