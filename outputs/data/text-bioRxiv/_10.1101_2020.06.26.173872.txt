ABSTRACT

SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 is a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease with C-terminal catalytic domain
belonging to the EndoU family. It degrades the polyuridine extensions in (-) sense strand of viral
RNA and some non-translated RNA on (+) sense strand. This activity seems to be responsible for the
interference with the innate immune response and evasion of host pattern recognition. Nsp15 is highly
conserved in coronaviruses suggesting that its activity is important for virus replication. Here we
report first structures with bound nucleotides and show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 specifically
recognizes U in a pattern previously predicted for EndoU. In the presence of manganese ions, the
enzyme cleaves unpaired RNAs. Inhibitors of Nsp15 have been reported but not actively pursued into
therapeutics. The current COVID-19 pandemic brought to attention the repurposing of existing drugs
and the rapid identification of new antiviral compounds. Tipiracil is an FDA approved drug that is
used with trifluridine in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Here, we combine crystallography,
biochemical and whole cell assays, and show that this compound inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 and
interacts with the uridine binding pocket of the enzyme’s active site, providing basis for the uracil
scaffold-based drug development.

INTRODUCTION

The current pandemic of COVID-19 is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As a typical member of the Coronaviridae family it is spherical,
enveloped, non-segmented, (+) sense RNA virus with a large ~30 kbs genome. There is no existing
vaccine or proven drug against SARS-CoV-2. Since February 2020, concerted efforts have focused
on characterizing its biology and developing various detection and treatment options, ranging from
vaccines through antibodies to antivirals.
The coronaviruses (+) sense RNA genomes are used as mRNA for translation of a large replicase
made of two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, and as a template for replication of its own copy 1.
These polypeptides are processed by two viral proteases: papain-like protease (PLpro, encoded within
Nsp3), and 3C-like protease (3CLpro or Mpro, encoded by Nsp5). For CoV-2 the cleavage yields 15
nonstructural proteins, Nsps (Nsp11 codes for just a 7-residues peptide) that assemble into a large
membrane-bound replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC) and exhibits multiple enzymatic and
binding activities. In addition, several sub-genomic RNAs are generated during virus proliferation
from (-) sense RNA, resulting in translation of 4 structural proteins and 9-10 accessory proteins.
Nonstructural proteins are potential drug targets for therapies and, because of their sequence and
function conservation, developed therapeutics might in principle inhibit all human coronaviruses.
Nsp15 is a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease. Its catalytic C-terminal domain shows sequence
similarity and functionality of the EndoU family enzymes, broadly distributed in viruses, archaea,
bacteria, plants, humans and other animals, that are involved in RNA processing. The viral EndoU
subfamily have been named NendoU. The Nsp15 enzyme is active as a 234 kDa hexamer consisting
of three dimers. It was reported that NendoU cleaves both single- and double-stranded RNA at uridine
sites producing 2’,3’-cyclic phosphodiester and 5´-hydroxyl termini

2.

The 2’,3’-cyclic

phosphodiester is then hydrolyzed to 3’-phosphomonoester. In coronaviruses, toroviruses and
arteriviruses, NendoU is mapping to Nsp15s and Nsp11s. Nsp15s are much more sequence conserved
than Nsp11s.

It was proposed that in coronaviruses Nsp15 affects viral replication by

interfering with the host's innate immune response

3,4.

To evade host pattern recognition receptor

MDA5 responsible for activating the host defenses, the Nsp15 cleaves the 5′-polyuridine tracts in (-)
sense viral RNAs, which are the product of polyA-templated RNA synthesis 5. These polyU
sequences correspond to MDA5-dependent pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and

NendoU activity limits their accumulation. For SARS-CoV it was reported that Nsp15 cleaves highly
conserved non-translated RNA on (+) sense strand showing that both RNA sequence and structure
are important for cleavage 6,7.
Recently we determined the first two crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 and showed that
it is similar to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV homologs. We have also shown that purified
recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 can efficiently cleave synthetic oligonucleotide substrate
containing single rU, 5′-6-FAM-dArUdAdA-6-TAMRA-3′ 8. Studies of NendoU subfamily members, Nsp15
and Nsp11, indicate that the enzymes vary in their requirement for metal ion, with Nsp15 variants
showing dependence on Mn2+. At the same time, the proteins are often compared to metalindependent eukaryotic RNase A, which has a completely different fold, but shares active site
similarities and broad function. Specifically, it carries two catalytic histidine residues, His12 and
His119, that correspond to indispensable His250 and His235 in SARS-CoV Nsp15. RNase A cleaves
its substrates in a two-step reaction consisting of transphosphorylation that generates 2’,3’-cyclic
phosphodiester followed by hydrolysis leading to 3’-phosphoryl terminus. The latter step has only
been reported for SARS-CoV Nsp15 9. Here, we have expanded Nsp15 research to explore
endoribonuclease sequence specificity, metal ion dependence and catalytic mechanism. In addition
to biochemical data, we report four new structures of the enzyme in complex with 5’UMP, 3’UMP,
5’GpU and Tipiracil - a uracil derivative. This compound is approved by FDA as a combination drug
that is used with trifluridine in the treatment of colorectal cancer

10.

Tipiracil inhibits the enzyme

thymidine phosphorylase which metabolizes trifluridine. We discovered that Tipiracil inhibits Nsp15
endoribonuclease activity, albeit not adequately to be an effective cure, but this scaffold can serve as
a template for compounds that may block virus proliferation.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Biochemical assays

Nsp15 nuclease activity
We tested Nsp15 endoribonuclease activity using several assays and different substrates. We
show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 requires Mn2+ ions and retains only little activity in the presence of

Mg2+ ions. The enzyme cleaves efficiently eicosamer 5’GAACU¯CAU¯GGACCU¯U¯GGCAG3’
at all four uridine sites (Fig. 1), as well as synthetic EndoU substrate (5′-6-FAM-dArU¯dAdA-6-TAMRA3′) 8

in the presence of Mn2+ and the reaction rate increases with metal ion concentration. The cleavage

of the eicosamer seems to show no sequence preference as 5’CU¯C, 5’AU¯G, 5’CU¯U and 5‘UU¯G
are recognized and cut, especially at higher manganese concentration (Fig. 1). At 5 mM manganese,
all four oligonucleotides accumulate, with the slowest cut sequence being the 5’AU¯G site. The
eicosamer that does not have uridine in the sequence is not cleaved. The observed CoV-2 Nsp15 Mn2+
dependence is unlike its SARS-CoV homolog 9. Interestingly, by itself the Nsp15 can cut RNAs at
any uridine site. But as a component of RTC with Nsp8 and Nsp12, Nsp15 becomes a site specific
endonuclease which cuts RNA to leave short 5-10 uridine tails 5 and also cuts the 3’end of conserved
non-coding region of RNA 6,7.
Our observations provide new insights that might be relevant to Nsp15 roles in SARS-CoV-2 life
cycle. First of all, earlier studies have demonstrated that coronavirus NendoU endonucleases that are
uridine-specific display differences in their requirement for Mn2+ ions. On one side of the spectrum
are Nsp11s of Equine Arteritis Virus (EAV), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus
(PRRSV) and Turkey Coronavirus Nsp15 that do not need Mn2+ for their endoribonuclease activity
11.

SARS-Cov-2 Nsp15 might represent the other extreme end of the range. Differences in the

requirement for Mn2+ ions may affect the outcomes of the endoribonuclease activity. For example,
metal-independent Nsp11 from EAV and some Nsp15s generate oligonucleotides with 2’,3’-cyclic
phosphodiesters at their 3’ ends 9. In contrast, metal-dependent SARS-CoV Nsp15 seems to be able
to hydrolyze 2’,3’-cyclic phosphodiesters and produce oligonucleotides with 3’-phosphoryl groups
on their 3’-ends 9. By analogy, the SARS-CoV-2 homolog should follow a two-step reaction, but this
hypothesis is yet to be tested as our assays do not discriminate between the two.
The requirement for Mn2+ ions by SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 may by itself enhance pathogen
infectivity because Mn2+ is required for the host innate immune responses to viral infections. RNA
binding of SARS-CoV Nsp15 was reported to be enhanced in the presence of Mn2+, whereas RNA
binding by the cellular XendoU homolog from frog was not affected by Mn2+ ions 6,7.
The role of metal ion is puzzling as it was proposed that Nsp15 may have similar activity to
eukaryotic RNase A. However, the RNase A activity is metal independent, perhaps suggesting that
metal ions may help to position RNA for binding or cleavage. No metal ions or strong metal-binding
sites were found in any of the models of EndoU family members available in the Protein Data Bank

(PDB). Our efforts to locate Mn2+ ion in the Nsp15 structures also failed, arguing against a direct role
of metal ions in catalysis. However, we observe the increase of Nsp15 thermal stability in the presence
of such ions (Supplementary Fig. 1), though molecular basis of this behavior remains enigmatic.
Previous data for SARS-CoV Nsp15, Mn2+ ions were found to change the intrinsic tryptophan
fluorescence of SARS-CoV Nsp15, indicating conformational changes 12,13.

Inhibition by Tipiracil
Since Tipiracil is an uracil derivative and Nsp15 is specific for U, we have speculated that the
compound may inhibit the enzyme. This hypothesis was tested by using heptamer RNA with single
uridine site AGGAAGU, which under experimental conditions remains single-stranded and does not
form duplexes. When labeled with cytidine 3’,5’-[5’-32P] bisphosphate (pCp), 5’-32P-labeled
derivatives of the heptamer and unlabeled 3’CMP are produced. The transfer of the 32P from the pCp
to the 3’ terminus of the heptamer is consistent with transphosphorylation mechanism. In the
presence of 5 mM MnCl2, only partial cleavage is observed. This reaction is decreased by 50% in
the presence of 7.5 mM Tipiracil (Fig. 2). At the higher Mn2+ ion concentration, the cleavage reaction
proceeds to completion but no inhibition by Tipiracil can be measured (data not shown).
We have also performed S antigen ELISA assay in A549 cells and CoV-2 virus replication assay
using qRT-PCR. Tipiracil was not affecting viability of cells but the inhibition of virus was found to
be modest in the concentration range 1 – 50 mM (Fig. 3). These preliminary data suggest that the
affinity of the compound may need to be improved in order to serve as an antiviral drug. Structural
information is essential for this process (see below).

Structure determination and binding of ligands
SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 protein was crystallized with 5’UMP, 3’UMP, 5’GpU and Tipiracil using
methods described previously 8 and the structures were determined at 1.82 Å, 1.85 Å, 1.97 Å and
1.85 Å, respectively. Crystals with ligands diffract to higher resolution than the apoprotein (2.20 Å).
Of note, we were unable to obtain co-crystals of Nsp15 with 5’AMP, 3’,5’-cyclic AMP, 5’GMP,
5’TMP and 5’CMP using this same set of conditions as tested for 5’UMP. All structures were solved
by molecular replacement using Nsp15 (PDB id: 6WVV) and refined as described in supplementary
Materials and Methods and supplementary Table 1. The majority of the un-cleaved His-tag is not

ordered and not visible but the electron density is excellent for all residues from M1 to Q347 and for
all bound ligands (Fig. 4).
In all four structures, ligands bind to the C-terminal catalytic domain active site (Fig. 4), though
the exact positions vary, as described below. In 5’GpU and Tipiracil complexes, there is also a
phosphate ion bound in the catalytic pocket. The compound binding is facilitated by side chains of
seven conserved residues His235, His250, Lys290, Trp333, Thr341, Tyr343, and Ser294 and main
chain of Gly248, Lys345, and Val292, as well as water molecules (Fig. 4). One non-conserved
residue, Gln245, is also involved through a water-mediated interaction. The interactions do not trigger
any major protein conformational changes either globally or locally. In fact, the catalytic residues
(His235, His250) and other active site residues discussed below show very similar conformations in
all complexes (RMSD 0. 29 Å over Ca atoms for residues His235, Gly248, His250, Lys290, Trp333,
Thr341, Tyr343 and Ser294 in the pairwise superposition of complexes with the apo-structure (the
highest is 0.39 Å for B chain of the Tipiracil complex and the lowest is 0.29 Å for the chain B of the
5’UMP complex)). Position of phosphate ion or 3’-phosphoryl group of 3’UMP is also preserved.
Specific interactions of ligands with protein are described below.

5’UMP Binding
The model of uracil binding by EndoU was proposed based on the EndoU and RNase A structures
2,

speculating that Ser294 might be responsible for base recognition. Here we describe experimental

details of such sequence discrimination. The base of 5’UMP forms van der Waals contacts with
Tyr343 and several hydrogen bonds with active site residues, including side chain OG and main chain
nitrogen atom of Ser294 (Fig. 4A). These interactions define O2 and N3 specificity. O4 interacts with
main chain nitrogen atom of Leu346 defining the uracil specificity. Potentially, cytosine and thymine
pyrimidines may also bind - an amino group in position 4 of C should be compatible with the
recognition pattern and a methyl group in position 5 should not interfere with binding either as uracil
position 5 is solvent accessible. In fact, recognition of C has been reported for distantly related,
though with similar active site, bacterial EndoU anticodon tRNase 14. The ribose ring makes several
hydrogen bonds with protein residues: (i) 2’OH interacts with Lys290 (NZ) and with NE2 of the
catalytic His250, (ii) 3’OH makes water mediated hydrogen bonds with catalytic His235 (NE2),
His250 (NE2), Thr341 (OG1) and Gly248 (main chain nitrogen atom), and (iii) O4’ is hydrogenbonded to main chain of Val292 via a water molecule. Interestingly, the 5’-phosphoryl group projects

into solvent with no interaction with protein atoms. Its only ordered interaction is with 3’OH through
a water molecule. This 5’-phosphoryl group location overlaps with that of Nsp15/5’GpU complex
(see below). Also worth mentioning is that the ribose in the Nsp15/5’UMP together with the
phosphate ion in the Nsp15/Tipiracil mimic 2’3’-cyclic phosphodiester. The structure with 5’UMP
shows how the enzyme discriminates between uracil and purine bases with Ser294 serving as the key
discriminatory residue, as has been hypothesized before 6,12,15,16.

5’GpU Binding
In RNA sequence containing uracil, such as 5’NpGpUpN3’, where N corresponds to any base,
the Nsp15 cleavage would produce 5’NpGpU3’p, if transphosphorylation is followed by hydrolysis
of 5’NpGpU2’3’p. In the crystal structure of Nsp15/5’GpU, the dinucleoside monophosphate binds
to the active site with uracil interacting with Tyr343 and Ser294 (Fig. 4B), as seen in the
Nsp15/5’UMP complex. However, the distance between O4 and main chain nitrogen of Leu346 is
too long to make a good hydrogen bond. This implicates some flexibility at the protein C-terminus
and suggests that the amino group in position 4 of cytosine can be accommodated, as we suggested
above and reported previously 8. The guanine ring is stacking against Trp333 and makes two
hydrogen bonds with water molecules. The absence of defined base-side chain interactions suggests
lack of specificity for this site in the substrate sequence. The Nsp15/5’GpU complex binds also a
phosphate ion in the active site, most likely from the crystallization buffer. The ion interacts with the
protein side chains (His235, His250, Thr341, and Lys290) and uridine ribose 2’OH and 3’OH groups.
It most likely mimics the binding of scissile phosphoryl group of the substrate. The backbone
phosphoryl group (5’ of U) faces solvent as in the Nsp15/5’UMP complex and makes a hydrogen
bond to a water molecule. This structure and the Nsp15/5’UMP complex illustrate location and
specificity determinants of the uridine with a 5’-phosphoryl group. The binding of guanine in the
structure identifies strong base binding site at Trp333, which, however, may not necessarily be
dedicated to 5’end of the oligonucleotide (see discussion below).

3’UMP Binding
We co-crystallized Nsp15 with 3’UMP, assuming that the enzyme would dock it in a manner
expected for uridine monophosphate nucleotide in the contexts of larger RNA substrate, preserving
the uracil specific interactions described above. Surprisingly, the uracil base is anchored by Trp333
8

in the guanine site observed in the Nsp15/5’GpU complex (Fig. 4C), confirming that this site can
accommodate purine and pyrimidine bases. The 3’-phosphoryl group occupies the phosphate ion site
created by His235, His250 and Thr341, as observed in Nsp15/5’GpU. It is surprising that uracil does
not go into its dedicated site, but the result demonstrates higher affinity for the base in the Trp333
site than in uracil-recognition site, potentially governed by the strong stacking interactions with the
aromatic side chain that take precedence over hydrogen bonds observed in the uracil binding of
5’UMP. The identity of the Trp333-interacting base is irrelevant, especially given that the enzyme’s
substrate is most likely a larger RNA molecule.

Tipiracil binding – a uracil derivative and Nsp15 inhibitor
The Tipiracil molecule binds to the uracil site as observed in 5’UMP and 5’GpU (Fig. 4D and 5).
The molecule makes several substrate analog-like interactions. The uracil ring stacks against Tyr341
and makes hydrogen bonds with Ser294 (interacting with O2 and N3), Lys345 (O4) and His250. The
N1 atom makes a hydrogen bond with a phosphate ion and through it connects to Lys290. There are
also two water mediated interactions to Ser294 and main chain carbonyl oxygen atom of Val292.
Iminopyrrolidin nitrogen atom binds to Gln245, representing the only interaction unique to the ligand.
Nsp15 binds Tipiracil in its active site in a manner compatible with competitive inhibition and the
compound and its derivatives may serve as inhibitors of the enzyme. This structure suggests that
uracil alone may have similar inhibitory properties and provides basis for the uracil scaffold-based
drug development.

Compounds influence on Nsp15 thermal stability
The differential scanning fluorimetry experiments (DSF) showed that melting temperature (Tm)
of the Nsp15 in a presence of Tipiracil, 5’GpU, 5ˈUMP, 3ˈUMP and 3’TMP is approximately 60.5°C
under investigated conditions with buffer that contains 10 mM MnCl2 (Supplementary Fig 1. A, B).
Depicted local minima of the Nsp15 first derivative of fluorescence signals have the same Tm values
as a control. Although, denaturation profile of the Nsp15 in a presence of Tipiracil is broader and
consistently shifted (0.5°C) to higher temperatures (Supplementary Fig 1. A). Therefore, DSF results
indicates the small increase of stability of complex of the Nsp15 and Tipiracil in comparison to
control sample and other tested Nsp15 complexes with 5’GpU, 5ˈUMP, 3ˈUMP and TMP. Additional
change in the Nsp15 Tm is observed at 83°C (Supplementary Fig. 1B). This is caused by all ligands

and may be related to increased stability of the hexamer or EndoU catalytic domain. In the presence
of Mn2+ ions the main Tm of Nsp15 is increased from 56.5°C to 60.5°C and is Mn2+ concentration
dependent. Interestingly, at 5 mM and 20 mM concentrations of Mn2+ a new local Tm minimum is
observed at 83°C potentially suggesting increased stability of the EndoU domain (Supplementary Fig.
1C).

Comparison of CoV-2 Nsp15 active site with RNase A – mechanistic implications
Our structures of complexes with nucleotides can inform catalytic mechanism of Nsp15
endoribonuclease. We compared our structures with eukaryotic RNase A, a very well-studied model
system 17. RNase A recognizes pyrimidine nucleotides in RNA, preferring C over U, and catalyzes a
two-step reaction, the transphosphorylation of RNA to form a 2‘,3‘-cyclic CMP intermediate
followed by its hydrolysis to 3‘CMP. Nsp15 also recognizes pyrimidines, preferring U over C, and
was proposed to catalyze an analogous reaction 9. In RNase A the base selectivity is achieved by
Thr45 that forms specific hydrogen bonds similar to those created by Ser294 in the Nsp15/5’UMP
and Nsp15/5’GpU complexes. In RNase A the transphosphorylation reaction proceeds via an
asynchronous concerted general acid/base mechanism involving His12, His119 and Lys41 18. In this
mechanism the 2’OH proton is transferred to the deprotonated form of His12 to activate the 2’O
nucleophile. Then, the protonated His119 donates a proton to the departing 5’OH group. Lys41
function is to stabilize the negative charge that accumulates on the nonbridging phosphoryl oxygen
atoms in the transition state. In the hydrolysis step the role of two histidine residues are inverted.
The RNase A active site is well organized and has several distinct pockets for binding RNA
substrates (e.g. bases B1, B2, B3 and phosphoryl groups P0, P1 and P2) (for review see 19,20). The B1
site provides base specificity and P1 site binds the scissile phosphoester bond. B0 represent the
binding site for the base upstream of the B1-P1 cleavage site. In the RNase A complex with the
5’dApdTp¯dApdA desoxyoligonucleotide (PDB id: 1RCN, 21), B0 interacts with adenine, B1 binds
thymine, etc. The P1 site represents the above mentioned catalytic machinery consisting of His12,
His119 and Lys41 and Lys41 assisted by Gln11 in phosphoryl binding.
Structural alignment of the Nsp15 and RNase A catalytic site residues and RNA ligands shows
that they adopt similar positions in the two enzymes. Specifically, His250, Ser294 and Lys290
virtually overlap with the His12, Thr45 and Lys41. His250, by analogy His12 in RNase A, is in
position to serve as the key residue in deprotonation of 2’OH. It is close to 2’OH in both 5’GpU and
10

5’UMP structures (3.2-3.8 Å respectively) and is in similar orientation in the complex of RNase A
with DNA (Fig. 6). Therefore, His250 is very likely to directly activate 2’OH. Lys290 seems to play
a role of Lys41 in RNase A. Main chain amide of Gly248 may provide function of Gln11 in binding
to the substrate phosphoryl group. If His250 is a base in Nsp15 then the His235 must be a proton
donor for the departing 5’OH group and equivalent of His119 of RNase A. However, these residues
are ~8 Å apart and approach the phosphoryl group from different direction (Fig. 6A). In RNase A,
His119 forms a hydrogen bond with Asp121 which may provide proton for the reaction. The
structural environment for His235 is different in Nsp15. Thr341 forms a hydrogen bond with His235
and there is also Asp240 further away that makes a water mediated hydrogen bond with His235. In
the hydrolysis step of converting the 2’3’-cyclic phosphate back to 2’OH and 3’-phosphoryl group
the roles of histidines are reversed and now His235 must be a base deprotonating a water molecule
and His250 serves as a donor of proton for the 2’OH leaving group. A different set of interactions
involving Nsp15 and RNase A catalytic residues may explain why Nsp15 activity is more sensitive
to low pH (data not shown) and it is expected that kinetics of the reactions will be different.
Besides similarities in P1, the two enzymes share the organization of B1 pocket. Here, Nsp15
has a very well-defined uracil recognition site made of Ser294, Tyr343 and L346 that are equivalent
to Thr45, Phe120 and Ser123 in RNase A. Further extrapolation from the RNase A model of the
desoxyoligonucleotide binding allows us to hypothesize that B2 site, dedicated to the base on the
3’end of scissile bond, in Nsp15 is created by Trp333. Its side chain provides stacking option for a
base with no base selectivity function. Yet in our Nsp15/5’GpU structure this site is occupied by the
G base located on the 5’end of U. We speculate, that for oligonucleotides that are flanked on both
sides of U, mimicking the RNase A ligand, 5’ guanine (or a different base) may adopt position of
5’dA that locates to the B0 site owing to the rotation of the P-5’O bond. Then, the available Trp333
base binding site can accept base on the 3’ end of the uridine moiety, somewhat resembling our
Nsp15/3’UMP structure. When we combine oligonucleotides from our structures with RNase A/DNA
complex a plausible model can be built of 5’GpUp¯U nucleotide bound to the Nsp15 active site (Fig.
6B). This model underscores importance of conserved Trp333 in anchoring RNA in the active site.
While Ser294 is the key residue in discriminating base, the hydrophobic interaction with Trp333 may
be a significant force for ligand docking. The B3 site is not easily identifiable in the available Nsp15
structures. In addition, unlike in RNase A, where all P0-P2 subpockets contribute to the backbone
binding, in Nsp15 only P1 site is currently well defined. 5’-phosphoryl groups in position P0 of the

ligands do not form any direct contacts with the protein, while RNase A P0 site has Lys66
participating in RNA binding. P2 site of RNase A is created by Lys7 and it appears that His243 may
fulfill such role in Nsp15.

CONCLUSIONS

The active site of Nsp15 can accommodate all four ligands, three nucleotides (5’UMP, 3’UMP,
5’GpU) and one synthetic analog (Tipiracil) and protein interactions with these molecules seem to
stabilize the active site residues and entire catalytic EndoU domain resulting in a better ordered
protein. Previous mutational studies demonstrated that two histidine (His235 and His250) and one
serine (Ser294) residues are essential for SARS-CoV Nsp15 activity. We now, for the first time,
illustrated how Ser294 participates in uracil (or pyrimidine) recognition and we concur with previous
suggestions that His250 may be key to deprotonate the 2’OH to allow nucleophilic attack on the
phosphoryl group. Comparisons of Nsp15 with RNase A active site show some similarities (active
site residues conservation) and indicated a common catalytic mechanism but organization of the RNA
binding site is distinct, especially at sites more distant from the elements crucial for chemistry.
Our structures are consistent with the binding of single stranded nucleic acid, such as loops or
bulges, as was shown for Nsp15s and other EndoUs. Both uracil and proceeding base must be in an
unpaired region in order to bind to Nsp15, which is consistent with degradation of polyU tracks as
reported recently 5. Our structures show that the proceeding base can be guanine or uracil, or other
bases as well (see below). Accommodation of 5’GpU and 5’GpUpU is in agreement with previous
reports of guanine preference in anterior position with respect to U and efficient degradation of polyU
tracks. However, SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 can cleave RNA, at high Mn2+ concentrations, at uridine sites
connected to any base in anterior position; for example, the synthetic EndoU substrate used for the
nuclease assay has “A”.
Nsp15 binds nucleotides to the catalytic domain of each monomer independently, therefore it is
not clear why the hexamer is required for the EndoU activity of the enzyme. We show that Nsp15
can bind and hydrolyze 4, 7 and 20 nucleotide long RNA. It is possible that the hexamer is needed to
bind longer RNA substrates or is involved in interactions with other proteins (for example Nsp8 and
Nsp12) within RTC 22.

The role for metal ion requirement remains a puzzle. Although the Mn2+ dependence has been
reported for some EndoU members and appears to be a common feature of NendoU subfamily, the
metal-binding site was never located. Past studies indicated that single strand polyU RNA is relatively
unstructured under most conditions. It was showed that Nsp15 cleavage is RNA sequence and
structure dependent. It is possible that the metal is required for maintaining conformation of the RNA
substrate during catalysis. For example, metal ions like Mg2+, Mn2+ and Zn2+ form complexes with
purine nucleotides to affect outcome of many enzymatic reactions 23. Binding of Mn2+ ions to RNA
molecules may dramatically transform their structure, as it was shown for riboswitch

24

and the

Bacillus subtilis M-box aptamer that sequence contains U track (PDB id: 3PDR, 25). As manganese
can exist in several oxidation states, it is also possible that metal redox properties can affect protein
and RNA interactions and chemistry.
Tipiracil, an uracil derivative, binds to Nsp15 uracil site in a manner consistent with competitive
inhibition. In vitro it inhibits Nsp15 RNA nuclease activity and shows modest inhibition of CoV-2
virus replication in the whole cell assay. While the compound itself is not optimal for the therapeutic
applications, our work shows that uracil and its derivatives may represent a plausible starting point
for nucleotide-like drug development. Moreover, interaction of Trp333 with bases may provide
additional site to build much higher affinity inhibitors.

Supplementary Materials and Methods

3’-CMP was obtained from Sigma. Crude [gamma-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer.
T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (3' phosphatase minus) was from New England BioLabs. All other
chemicals were reagent grade.

Cytidine and uridine 3,5’-bisphophates synthesis
[5’-32P]pCp was prepared by phosphorylation of 3’-CMP as described by England et al. (1980).
RNA synthesis
RNA eicosamers were synthetized by runoff transcription of synthetic double-stranded DNA
templates as described by Sherlin et al. 28. 5’-32P-labeled RNA eicosamers and 3’-32P-labeled RNA
heptamers were prepared according to Zwieb et al. 29 and England et al. 30, respectively.

Protein purification and crystallization
Protein was expressed and purified as described previously. Briefly, a 4 l culture of LB Lennox
medium was grown at 37°C (190 rpm) in presence of ampicillin 150 mg/ml. Once the culture reached
OD600 ~1.0, the temperature setting was changed to 4°C. When bacterial suspension cooled down to
18°C it was supplemented with the following components to indicated concentration: 0.2 mM IPTG,
0.1% glucose, 40 mM K2HPO4. The temperature was set to 18°C for 20 h incubation. Bacterial cells
were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000 g and cell pellets were resuspended in a 12.5 ml lysis buffer
(500 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 20 mM imidazole and 1 mM TCEP) per
liter culture and sonicated at 120W for 5 minutes (4 sec ON, 20 sec OFF). The cellular debris was
removed by centrifugation at 30,000 g for 1 h at 4°C. Supernatant was mixed with 4 ml of Ni2+
Sepharose (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated with lysis buffer supplemented to 50 mM
imidazole pH 8.0 and suspension was applied on Flex-Column (420400-2510) connected to Vac-Man
vacuum manifold (Promega). Unbound proteins were washed out via controlled suction with 160 ml
of lysis buffer (50 mM imidazole). Bound proteins were eluted with 20 ml of lysis buffer
supplemented imidazole to 500 mM pH 8.0. Then 1 mM TCEP was added followed by Tobacco Etch
Virus (TEV) protease treatment at 1:20 protease:protein ratio. The solution was left at 4°C overnight.

For this particular construct, TEV protease was not able to cleave off the His tag. Nsp15 was
successfully separated from TEV protease on Superdex 200 column equilibrated in lysis buffer where
10 mM β-mercaptoethanol was replaced by 1 mM TCEP. Fractions containing Nsp15 were collected.
Lysis buffer was replaced on 30 kDa MWCO filter (Amicon-Millipore) via 10X
concentration/dilution repeated 3 times to crystallization buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH
7.5, 1 mM TCEP). Final concentration of Nsp15 was 19 mg/ml.

Crystallization experiments also were conducted as described previously.
All complexes, Nsp15/5’UMP, Nsp15/5’GpU, and Nsp15/Tipiracil were prepared by mixing 515 mM of each ligand with 0.2 mM Nsp15 and incubate for at least 30 minutes before crystallization.
Crystals of Nsp15/5’GpU and Nsp15/Tipiracil, the hexagonal crystal form, in P63 space group, were
obtained from MCSG1 screen A3 condition containing 0.2 M sodium chloride, 0.1 M
sodium/potassium phosphate pH 6.2, 10 %(w/v) PEG8000. These crystals diffracted x-rays to 1.93
and 1.85 Å for Nsp15/5’GpU and Nsp15/Tipiracil, respectively. The crystals of Nsp15/5’UMP
complex grew from the Crystal Screen Classic HTP (Jena bioscience) C2 condition containing 16
%(w/v) PEG4000, 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5, 0.2 M sodium acetate and diffracted to 1.82 Å. To achieve
higher occupancies of the ligands in the structures, each ligand compound was added to the cryosolution and the co-crystal was soaked for 2-3 min before frozen in the liquid nitrogen.

Endoribonuclease Assays
Typical reaction contained 5x105 CPM of 5’-32P-labeled RNA eicosamers or 3’-32P-labeled RNA
heptamers (0.5 µM final RNA concentration) and 10 nM SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 in 20 mM HEPESKOH (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT and either 5 mM or 11 mM MnCl2. To inhibit endonuclease,
Tipiciril dissolved in water was added. Following incubation at 30°C for up to 60 min, the reactions
were stopped by adding an equal volume of a gel-loading buffer containing 95% formamide, 10 mM
EDTA and 0.025% SDS. The products were analyzed in 20% polyacrylamide gels
(acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio, 19:1) buffered with 0.5´ Tris-borate-EDTA containing 7 M urea.

conditions

with

SARS-CoV-2

(nCoV/Washington/1/2020, kindly provided by the National Biocontainment Laboratory, Galveston, TX).

Cell viability
Cell viability was measured by staining with CellTracker™ Red CMTPX (ThermoFisher
Scientific). CoV-2 infected cell was stained with 2 µM of CellTracker™ Red CMTPX for 30 min
and then detected by Tecan Infinite m200 (Tecan) at ex577/em602 nm. After reading, cells were fixed
by 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) for immunohistochemistry assay.

Immunostaining against Spike protein
Immunostaining was performed on 10% NBF fixed SARS-CoV-2 infected cells in 96-well plate.
After fixation, 10% NBF was removed, and cells were washed with PBS, followed by washing with
PBS-T (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS), and then blocked for 30 min with PBS containing 1% BSA at room
temperature. After blocking, endogenous peroxidases were quenched by 3% hydrogen peroxide for
5 min. Then, cells were washed with PBS and PBS-T and incubated with a monoclonal mouse-antiSARS-CoV-2 spike antibody (GeneTex, 1:1000) in PBS containing 1% BSA overnight at 4°C.
Primary antibody was washed with PBS and PBS-T and then cells were incubated in secondary
antibody (ImmPRESS Horse Anti-Mouse IgG Polymer Reagent, Peroxidase; Vector Laboratories)
for 60 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS for 10 min, color development was achieved
by applying diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) solution (Metal Enhanced DAB Substrate
Kit; ThermoFisher Scientific) for 30 mins and detected by Tecan Infinite m200 (Tecan) at 492 nm
after replacing DAB solution to PBS. Result was normalized by cell viability.

RNA Extraction and qRT-PCR
Total RNA from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells was isolated using a NucleoSpin 96 RNA kit
following the manufacturer’s instructions (Macherey-Nagel). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was quantified by
qRT-PCR using SuperScript™ III Platinum™ One-Step qRT-PCR Kit w/ROX (ThermoFisher
Scientific) and normalized using Eukaryotic 18S rRNA Endogenous Control (VIC™/MGB probe,

Protein differential scanning fluorimetry
The Nsp15 differential scanning fluorimetry assays were done in a buffer 20 mM Tris pH 7.5,
100 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP that was supplemented with SYPRO Orange (Invitrogen) dye to 5x final
concentration. We used 10 µM of the Nsp15 with addition of 1 mM of Tipiracil, 5’GpU, 5ˈUMP,
3ˈUMP, TMP, respectively to get final molar ratio of protein to ligand 1:100. Additionally, the
samples with ligands were supplemented with 10 mM MnCl2. After 30 minutes of incubation of
samples at room-temperature fluorescence measurements were done using CFX Connect Real-Time
System (BioRad). Fluorescent signal was detected with temperature rate 1°C per 60 sec. Graphs
represents the first derivative of observed fluorescence signal. Samples were measured in triplicates
and the representative standard deviation of measurements are depicted for Nsp15 control sample and
complex of the Nsp15 with addition of Tipiracil.

Data collection, structure determination and refinement
The x-ray diffraction experiments were carried out at the Structural Biology Center 19-ID
beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The diffraction images were
recorded at 100 K from all crystal forms on the PILATUS3 X 6M detector using 0.5° rotation and
0.5 sec exposure for 140°, 110°, and 210° for Nsp15/5’UMP, Nsp15/5’GpU and Nsp15/Tipiracil,
respectively. The data were integrated and scaled with the HKL3000 suite

31.

Intensities were

converted to structure factor amplitudes in the Ctruncate program 32,33 from the CCP4 package 34 and
using the apo-form SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 structure (PDB id: 6VWW) as a search model, the structures
were determined using molrep

35,

all implemented in the HKL3000 software package. The initial

solutions were refined, both rigid-body refinement and regular restrained refinement by REFMAC
34,36

as a part of HKL3000. The models including the ligands were manually adjusted using COOT 37

and then iteratively refined using COOT and PHENIX 38. Throughout the refinement, the same 5%

refinement). The final structures converged to Rwork = 0.170 and Rfree = 0.195 for Nsp15/5’UMP,
Rwork = 0.157 and Rfree = 0.185 for Nsp15/5’GpU and Rwork = 0.171 and Rfree = 0.194 for
Nsp15/Tipircil with regards to each data quality. The stereochemistry of the structure was checked
with PROCHECK 39 and the Ramachandran plot and validated with the PDB validation server. The
data collection and processing statistics are given in supplemental Table 1.
