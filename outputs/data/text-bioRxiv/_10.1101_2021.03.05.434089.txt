ABSTRACT

24

There are concerns about neutralizing antibodies (NAb) potency against the newly emerged

25

VOC202012/01 (UK) and 501Y.V2 (SA) SARS-CoV-2 variants in mRNA-vaccinated subjects

26

and in recovered COVID-19 patients. We used a viral neutralization test with a strict 100%

27

neutralizing criterion on UK and SA clinical isolates in comparison with a globally distributed

28

D614G SARS-CoV-2 strain. In two doses BNT162b2-vaccinated healthcare workers (HCW),

29

despite heterogeneity in neutralizing capacity against the three SARS-CoV-2 strains, most of

30

the sera harbored at least a NAb titer ≥ 1:10 suggesting a certain humoral protection activity

31

either on UK or SA variants. However, six months after mild forms of COVID-19, an important

32

proportion of HCW displayed no neutralizing activity against SA strain. This result supports

33

strong recommendations for vaccination of previously infected subjects.

INTRODUCTION

47

In the gene encoding the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, various mutations have been

48

reported[1,2] and recently, the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa (SA) have faced a rapid

49

increase in COVID-19 cases mediated by the emergence of new variants (VOC-202012/01 for

50

UK and 501Y.V2 for SA)[3,4]. The spreading of these variants has increased rapidly in other

51

countries and recent observations suggests that they are significantly more transmissible than

52

previously circulating variants. It is still not fully known if the pathogenicity is either increased,

53

although some elements have been recently released with likely enhanced disease severity for

54

the UK strain[5].

55

These variants harbor a specific pattern of deletion and mutations including amino-acid

56

replacements at key sites in the S Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) (K417N, E484K, N501Y

57

for the SA strain and only N501Y for the UK strain). In the era of the COVID-19 vaccination,

58

the question remained whether these variants could escape the neutralizing response elicited by

59

mRNA-vaccine. Two recent studies performed on engineered SARS-CoV-2 viruses containing

60

only some mutations from the newly emerged UK and SA variants showed weaker

61

neutralization capacity of vaccine-elicited sera[6,7]. Another study tested SARS-CoV-2-S

62

pseudoviruses bearing either the Wuhan reference strain or the UK spike protein with

63

BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited sera showed a slightly reduced but overall largely preserved

64

neutralizing titers against the UK pseudovirus[8]. However, none of these studies was

65

performed on clinical isolates harboring the full genomic mutations background of UK and SA

66

strains. Thus, the question remained whether a replicating virus with the full set of S mutations,

67

which may potentially interfere with antibody binding would be neutralized efficiently by

68

convalescent COVID-19 or BNT162b2-immune sera, especially in the healthcare workers

69

(HCW), a particularly exposed population to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

70

To answer this question, we performed a virus neutralization test (VNT), with a strict 100%

71

inhibition criterion, on sera from HCW with either previous mild forms of COVID-19 or

72

BNT162b2 immunization using three clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 variants: a D614G strain

73

(D614G) which became the dominant form of the virus circulating globally in the second part

74

of 2020[2], a UK strain (UK, lineage B.1.1.7) and a SA strain (SA, lineage B.1.351).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

77

Study population and serum specimen

78

Convalescent sera were recovered six months after symptom’s onset from symptomatic

79

healthcare workers with a positive RT-PCR result. BNT162b2-vaccine elicited sera were

80

recovered three weeks after the first injection and seven days after the booster immunization.

81

This retrospective study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki without

82

addition to standard of care procedures. Data collection were declared to the Sorbonne

83

Université Data Protection Committee under number 2020-025 in accordance with French law.

84

Written informed consent for participation in this study was obtained from all participants.

85

SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay

86

SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid (N) IgG were determined using a commercially available

87

immunoassay kit (Alinity SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, Abbott Laboratories) according to the

88

manufacturer’s instructions.

89

SARS-CoV-2 strains

90

SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates D614G, UK and SA (GenBank accession number MW322968,

91

MW633280 and MW580244 respectively) were isolated from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR

92

confirmed patients. Viral stocks were generated and titrated by the limiting dilution assay

95

Virus neutralization test

96

The neutralizing activity of the various serum specimen was assessed with a whole virus

97

replication assay as previously describe (9). Microscopy examination on day 4 to assess the

98

cytopathic effect (CPE). Neutralization antibody (NAb) titers are expressed as the highest

99

serum dilution displaying 100% inhibition of the CPE. A same known positive control serum

100

was added to each experiment to assess the reproductivity.

101

Statistical analysis

102

Difference in distribution of NAb titer between UK strain or SA strain with the D614G strain

103

was performed with a two-tailed Mann-Whitney-U test in GraphPad Prism 6.0. A probability

104

value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

106

RESULTS

107

We studied two sets of serum samples from HCW: a convalescent group of 15 participants with

108

SARS-CoV-2 proven infection on March 2020 and a vaccinated group of 29 participants

109

without history of clinical COVID-19 and which were negative for SARS-CoV-2 anti-

110

nucleocapsid (N) IgG. The median [IQR] age was 50 [40 – 58] years and 40% (6/15) were male

111

for the convalescent group. The median age was 55 [49 – 58] and 32% (9/29) were male for the

112

vaccinated group. Convalescent sera were collected 6 months after the symptom’s onset (184

113

[182 – 189] days). BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited sera were collected 3 weeks after the first

114

injection (except for four HCW) and 7 days after the second injection of BNT162b2-vaccine.

115

All the serum samples were tested for their neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 D614G,

116

UK and SA clinical strains. Three weeks after the first injection of the BNT162b2 vaccine, 52%

117

(13/25) of HCW harbored neutralizing activity with a NAb titer ≥ 1:5 against the D614G strain,

118

24% (6/25) were neutralizing against the UK strain and only two (8%) had detectable NAbs

119

against the SA strain (Figure 1 A, Table S1). Seven days after the booster immunization, all but

120

one HCW displayed neutralizing activity against the three SARS-CoV-2 clinical strains with a

121

median neutralizing titer of 1:160 [80 – 160] against the D614G strain, 1:40 [40 –80] against

122

the UK strain and 1:20 [20 – 40] against the SA strain. The median neutralizing titers against

123

UK and SA strains were significantly reduced compared to median NAb titer against the D614G

124

strain 7 days after the second injection of BNT162b2 vaccine (respectively, p < 0.0001 and p <

125

0.0001) (Figure 1 B, Table S1). Six months after the symptom’s onset, all the 15 HCW of the

126

convalescent group harbored neutralizing activity against the D614G strain (median

127

neutralizing titer of 1:20 [1:10 – 1:40]) and the UK strain (median neutralizing titer 1:20 [1:5 –

128

1:20]) without statistical difference between the respective NAb titers (p = 0.40). However,

129

only 60% (9/15) serum samples of these HCW displayed a neutralizing activity against the SA

130

strain with a median titer of 1:5 (Figure 1 C, Table S2).

131
132

DISCUSSION

133

In this work we assessed the neutralizing activity of sera from 15 convalescent COVID-19 or

134

29 BNT162b2-vaccinated HCW against the two rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants of

135

concern VOC202012/01 and 501Y.V2 and the globally circulating variant D614G using a VNT

136

with whole replicating clinical strains. Based on a very strict criterion of 100% inhibition of

137

CPE to determine NAb titer, we show that, three weeks after a single dose of BNT162b2, these

138

NAb titers remain low or absent among HCW especially against the UK and SA variants and

139

could questioned the extend of the dosing interval of BNT162b2 in some countries in order to

140

vaccinate as many people as possible. However, we were not able to follow participants more

141

than three weeks after the first injection because all of them received a second dose of

142

BNT162b2 according to the French guidelines. Nevertheless, seven days after the booster

143

immunization all but one vaccinated HCW develop NAbs against the three strains with a highest

144

neutralizing activity against the strain closely related to the Wuhan ancestral strain, the D614G

145

strain. Despite lower NAb titers against the UK and the SA strains most of the participants have

146

displayed a neutralizing activity ≥ 1:10 which could be at least indicative of a potential

147

protection against severe COVID-19 even with these variants. We also demonstrate a lack of

148

serum neutralizing activity against SA strain in up to 40% of HCW recovered from mild form

149

of COVID-19 six months after the symptom’s onset. This finding, and the recent report

150

describing a severe case of reinfection by the SA variant four months after a first COVID-19

151

infection[9], highlights the need of vaccination even in people who had recovered from a

152

previous COVID-19, especially during the increased circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 variants.

153

Nevertheless, correlates of immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 are not well defined, only few studies

154

have tried to assess these correlates in other human coronaviruses (HCoV) with experimental

155

challenges on volunteers. They showed an association between serum NAb titer pre-exposure

156

and viral excretion[10]. Further studies are required to determine the SARS-CoV-2 correlates

157

of vaccine-induced protection based on NAb and T cell responses. A limitation of our work is

158

that we were not able to assess potential cellular response differences against the three strains

159

in the vaccinated or convalescent groups although it has been described generation of a robust

160

CD4+ and CD8+ responses against the Wuhan ancestral strain[11]. The long-term evaluation

161

regarding the lasting of NAb induced by vaccination is needed to assess the durability of

162

protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

163

CONCLUSION

165

In conclusion, in BNT162b2-vaccinated participants with two dose regimen, despite

166

heterogeneity neutralizing capacity against the three SARS-CoV-2 variants, most of the sera

harbored at least a NAb titer ≥ 1:10. Although immune protection correlates need to be defined,

168

our findings suggests a certain humoral protection activity either on UK or SA variants after

169

two doses of mRNA-vaccine. However, we show that six months after SARS-CoV-2 infection

170

leading to mild forms of COVID-19, an important proportion of HCW displayed no neutralizing

171

activity against SA strain. This result supports a strong recommendation for SARS-CoV-2

172

vaccination of previously infected subjects.
