Abstract
We determined the antigen binding activity of convalescent plasma units from 47
individuals with a history of non-severe COVID-19 using three clinical diagnostic serology
assays (Beckman, DiaSorin, and Roche) with different SARS-CoV-2 targets. We compared
these results with functional neutralization activity using a fluorescent reporter strain of SARSCoV-2 in a microwell assay. This revealed positive correlations of varying strength (Spearman r
= 0.37-0.52) between binding and neutralization. Donors age 48-75 had the highest
neutralization activity. Units in the highest tertile of binding activity for each assay were enriched
(75-82%) for those with the highest levels of neutralization.

Background
The transfer of passive immunity with convalescent plasma is a promising strategy for
treatment and prevention of COVID-19 [1]. Challenges include the heterogeneity of anti-SARSCoV-2 antibody responses [2] and the variety of assay techniques to measure antigen binding
activities [3]. Although greater severity COVID-19 disease is correlated with antibody titers [4],
the majority of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 (and potential convalescent plasma
donors) have non-severe disease [5]. It is therefore especially important to assess the variability
in antigen binding activity of convalescent plasma from donors with less severe disease and to
determine how readily available serologic measurements correlate with functional neutralization
activity in this population.

Viral neutralization titers measure the ability of antibodies to prevent viral infection of a
eukaryotic cell line in vitro. Both live and pseudotyped virus assays exist for SARS-CoV-2 [6,7],
as well as surrogate assays that measure blockade of the Spike-ACE2 protein interaction [8].
Pseudotyped and recombinant protein assays require less restrictive biosafety procedures and
facilities; however, results may differ from live viral assays since pseudotyped viruses typically
express only a single viral entry protein. Neutralizing antibodies that impact other viral targets
and processes may therefore not be detected by pseudotyped viral assays [9]. Readouts of
neutralization assays also vary, but standard viral plaque reduction readouts are labor-intensive.
Fluorescence-based assays use an engineered viral particle with a fluorescent protein gene
expressed upon viral infection of eukaryotic cells [10]. Fluorescence assays correlate well with
plaque reduction, but are faster and readily automated[7]. Despite these innovations, live SARSCoV-2 neutralization assays remain available only in specialized laboratories and are not widely
used to screen convalescent plasma due to complexity of implementation, high cost, low
throughput, and biosafety concerns.

In addition, clinical assays that measure the binding of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
to specific viral antigens have been rapidly developed. These assays were primarily designed to
diagnose past COVID-19 exposure and none of the currently available assays measure the
ability of antibodies to neutralize the virus or prevent viral entry into cells. However, many of
these clinical assays can be run on high-throughput, automated instruments. As a result, these
assays can be performed at low cost, low safety risk to laboratory staff, high throughput, and in
almost any clinical laboratory.

Initial reports have suggested some correlation between binding antibody activity and
viral neutralization titers [11]. Data from other coronaviruses suggests that plasma with
detectable antibodies at a 1:160 or 1:320 dilution using a clinical binding assay should have

high neutralizing titers as well [11]. However, these assumptions have not been rigorously
tested and the dilution of samples requires specific assay validation and overhead. Even without
dilution, many clinical serology assays provide a quantitative serologic score of antibody
reactivity.

Despite these uncertainties, there is currently high demand for COVID-19 convalescent
plasma for compassionate use and clinical trials. Therefore, we sought to determine in a realworld cohort of donors with a history of non-severe COVID-19, the relationship between antigen
binding activity measured by several FDA approved clinical diagnostic assays, and
neutralization activity against live SARS-CoV-2 recombinantly engineered to express
fluorescent mNeonGreen protein in infected Vero E6 cells [7,10].

Methods
Convalescent Plasma Donor Recruitment
The NorthShore University HealthSystem COVID-19 convalescent plasma collection
program was established in April 2020. This program and associated human subject research,
performed in in accordance with the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration, were
approved by the NorthShore University HealthSystem Institutional Review Board. All potential
donors provided written consent for the study and provided information about their COVID-19
disease history and demographics. Disease history was reported in free-text format and the
absence of a reported symptom was assumed to indicate that the symptom was not present.
For the donors included in this study, reported symptoms included fatigue (49%), myalgia
(47%), cough (47%), anosmia (43%), headache (40%), and other symptoms <20% each (Table
S1). None of the donors had a history of hospitalization for COVID-19.

Samples were collected at the time of donation using serum separator tubes (BD,
Franklin Lakes, NJ), centrifuged, aliquoted, and frozen at -80 C. For each sample included in
this study, an aliquot was shipped to the University of Minnesota for viral neutralization titer
measurement on dry ice.

Clinical Serology Testing
An aliquot was thawed and tested at NorthShore using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2
(Roche Diagnostics), Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Beckman Coulter), and LIAISON SARS-CoV-2
S1/S2 IgG (DiaSorin). Both the quantitative cutoff index and qualitative results were recorded.
Samples were divided into tertiles based on the Roche assay results, then 47 were randomly
selected to equally sample each tertile.

SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD Ig ELISA
The anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD total Ig assay employed a standard indirect enzyme
immunoassay technique (ELISA), described in detail elsewhere, using a secondary antibody
recognizing all human immunoglobulin isotypes (goat anti-human IgG H+L-HRP,
Invitrogen/ThermoFisher) [12,13]. Three-fold serum dilutions were tested: 1:50 to >1:12,150.
ELISA titer was reported as the dilution at which absorbance of each sample tested exceed the
50% maximal absorbance signal for a positive control sample on the same ELISA plate.

Live SARS-CoV-2 Virus Neutralization Assay
Vero E6 cells (2.5×104) were seeded in each well of a 96-well Black/Clear Flat Bottom
TC-treated plate (Falcon) and incubated in DMEM overnight at 37°C with 5% CO2 prior to
infection. Plasma samples were two-fold serially diluted (from 1:20 to 1:5120) in DMEM and
incubated with mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 at 37°C for 1 hr. Medium was removed from cells
and the virus-plasma mixture was added to achieve a final multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1

plaque forming units per cell. The cells were incubated at 37°C with the virus-plasma mixture for
24-26 hr. Following incubation, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4°C for 30
minutes. The PFA-virus-plasma mixture was removed, cells were washed once with PBS, and
50 μl of PBS was added to each well. The fluorescence signal was determined by reading the
plates on a BioTek Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Reader, using excitation/emission
wavelengths of 488/517 nm. Percent maximal infection was determined for each dilution as the
ratio of the fluorescent signal to the maximal signal for non-serum-treated controls in the same
plate. A nonlinear regression method was used to determine the dilution that neutralized 50% of
mNeonGreen fluorescence (NT50) by using Prism 8 (GraphPad). If a plasma titration failed to
generate 50% inhibition within the range of concentrations tested, a titer value of ½ (1:10) of the
highest serum concentration tested was ascribed to it. Each sample was tested in duplicate.

Statistical Analysis
Assay results were compared using linear regression and Spearman correlation. Results
from each assay were broken into equal tertiles for comparison; tertiles were compared using
the Kruskal-Wallis test. Comparisons of NT50 between two groups used the Mann-Whitney U
test.

Results
Fluorescent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization
We tested 47 units of convalescent plasma units from individuals with a history of nonsevere COVID-19 for viral neutralization activity. There was a broad range of neutralization
against live SARS-CoV-2, with 6 (13%) units demonstrating high NT50 values >500, and 6 (13%)
with undetectable high NT50 values < 20 (Figure S1). Neutralization assays results yielded a
robust calculation of NT50 with R2 values > 0.9 for curve fitting (Figure 1A) in the majority of
samples with detectable neutralization activity.

Binding and Neutralization Assay Comparison
We compared the neutralization activity in these samples to binding activity as measured
by an in-house ELISA for S1 RBD total Ig, as well as three clinical diagnostic assays that use
different viral antigenic targets: Beckman (IgG anti-S1 RBD) DiaSorin (IgG anti-S1/S2 protein)
and Roche (total anti-Nucleocapsid Ig). There was a universally positive relationship between
NT50 and all four binding assays tested, with Spearman correlation r ranging from 0.37-0.52,
and R2 values of 0.17 to 0.40 reflecting a weak linear relationship (Figure 1B and C). The
strongest positive correlation between assays was the Beckman and DiaSorin assays
(Spearman r = 0.85), which measure different aspects of anti-Spike protein binding activity. The
Roche total anti-nucleocapsid assay had the lowest overall correlation with NT50, but stronger
positive correlation with the Beckman and DiaSorin assays (Figure 1C).

We identified several individual donors with discordant binding and neutralization
activity, including some with high neutralization and low binding activities in individual assays
(Figure 1A and B, red circles and green inverted triangles). We also identified individual units
characterized by low neutralization despite relatively high binding activity in individual assays
(Figure 1A and B, black square and inverted triangle).

Tertile analysis to enrich for highly neutralizing convalescent plasma units
Because the optimal NT50 that corresponds to functional immune protection is not known
and depend on the neutralization assay used, we assigned each convalescent plasma unit to a
neutralization tertile and sought to determine how different donor and binding characteristics
enrich for units found in the top two tertiles of neutralization activity. These included units with
NT50 values of either 1:78-180, or >1:180. There was a significant difference in NT50 depending
on donor age. Donors in the oldest tertile (age 48-75) had the highest enrichment for the top two

neutralization tertiles (p=0.04). However, no other donor demographic including sex, fever,
symptom duration or reported COVID-19 symptoms correlated with NT50 (Figure 2A and S2).
We observed no association between neutralization or binding and the time from either
symptom onset or symptom end to sample collection (Figure S2).

Most highly neutralizing antibodies were in the top tertile of binding activity for each
assay. 69% of the units in the top tertile of binding activity for the S1 RBD ELISA assay were in
the highest tertile of neutralization activity and 13% in the middle neutralization tertile (82% were
highly neutralizing), see Figure 2B-C. Clinical serological assays were similar in this regard, 7582% of the units in the highest binding tertile were highly neutralizing. Only the S1 RBD ELISA
contained no units with undetectable neutralization activity in the highest binding tertile (Figure
2B); whereas each clinical assay contained at least one non-neutralizing sample in the highest
binding tertile.

Discussion
These findings illustrate the difficulty in deriving information about functional antibody
responses using anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding assays. Although a correlation exists, the relatively
high discordance rate in donors with a history of non-severe COVID-19 may adversely affect the
interpretation of convalescent plasma clinical trial data. Furthermore, the discordance observed
implies that SARS-CoV-2 patients develop a broad antibody repertoire against multiple proteins
and epitopes; each of which may only partially contribute to the overall neutralization of the
virus.

Several larger studies that included hospitalized patients with more severe disease have
shown higher anti-COVID-19 antibody binding reactivity in individuals who had been

hospitalized or received treatment for COVID-19. Interestingly, anti-COVID-19 antibody levels,
as measured by binding assays, are high in hospitalized patients during their hospitalization and
formation of these antibodies is not related to a decline in viral load [2]. Future studies are
needed to understand the significance of these observations. It is possible that high titer binding
antibodies with low neutralization potential lead to antibody dependent enhancement,
suggesting that selecting convalescent plasma units based on high binding activity alone may
cause harm [14]. Similarly, future studies are needed to determine if developing high titer
binding antibodies with low neutralization potential is a poor prognostic sign.

In this study, increasing age correlated with NT50, consistent with other reports [15],
perhaps due to relatively more severe disease processes and greater viral exposure in this age
group, though the same association was not seen with symptom duration or fever. However,
given the heterogeneity of COVID-19 disease symptoms, it is unclear whether how well
symptom history reflects the degree of immunological stimulation.

Although the neutralizing antibody dose needed for clinical benefit is unknown, units in our
top 2 neutralization tertiles had activity consistent with current FDA recommendations (NT50
>1:160 or >1:80). Other factors such as the number of units transfused, the viral load at the time
of transfusion, the degree of irreversible end organ damage at the time of transfusion, and the
extracellular fluid volume of the recipient may be critical factors in determining whether a unit
with a certain concentration of neutralizing antibody shows clinical benefit.
