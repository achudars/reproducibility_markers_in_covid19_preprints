binding region (RBD) plays an important role in the process of viral binding receptor

32

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and membrane fusion, making it an ideal

33

target for vaccine development. In this study, we designed three different

34

RBD-conjugated nanoparticles vaccine candidates, RBD-Ferritin (24-mer), RBD-mi3

35

(60-mer) and RBD-I53-50 (120-mer), with the application of covalent bond linking by

36

SpyTag-SpyCatcher system. It was demonstrated that the neutralizing capability of

37

sera from mice immunized with three RBD-conjugated nanoparticles adjuvanted with

38

AddaVax or Sigma Systerm Adjuvant (SAS) after each immunization was ~8- to

39

120-fold greater than monomeric RBD group in SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and

40

authentic virus neutralization assay. Most importantly, sera from RBD-conjugated

41

NPs groups more efficiently blocked the binding of RBD to ACE2 or neutralizing

42

antibody in vitro, a further proof of promising immunization effect. Besides, high

43

physical stability and flexibility in assembly consolidated the benefit for rapid

44

scale-up production of vaccine. These results supported that our designed

45

SARS-CoV-2 RBD-conjugated nanoparticle was competitive vaccine candidate and

46

the carrier nanoparticles could be adopted as universal platform for future vaccine

148

We next observe the structural characterization of RBD-conjugated nanoparticles

149

by using negative stain electron microscopic (EM). As shown in Figure 2A, RBD was

150

conjugated with Ferritin, mi3 and I53-50 nanoparticles and presented on the surface

151

of monodispersed particles. As shown by the EM graphs, a burred exterior surface of

152

nanoparticles could be observed among RBD-conjugated NPs, especially for

153

RBD-Ferritin

154

N1-SpyCatcher-NPs and RBD-conjugated NPs were further measured by Dynamic

155

Light Scattering (DLS). As displayed in Figure 2B, particle characteristic of both

156

unconjugated NPs and RBD-conjugated NPs were validated and uniform distribution

157

parameters were given (Figure 2B). A close Tm1 of RBD and RBD-conjugated NPs

primarily indicated that the overall structure of RBD upon the nanoparticle was not

may be ascribed to RBD-buried unsatisfied exterior surface, which even strengthened

the structural viability of covalent bond linking strategy for RBD with the

In vitro antigenicity validation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-conjugated

180

We next expressed and purified recombinant human ACE2 ectodomain and

181

RBD-specific neutralizing antibody (CB6), and then characterized the antigenicity of

182

RBD-conjugated NPs by detecting the binding affinity with the receptor and antibody.

183

CB6 neutralization antibody was isolated from a COVID-19 convalescent patient and

184

recognized an epitope that overlap with the hACE2-binding site of RBD, a critical

185

character enabling a potential effect to neutralize the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus 27.

186

ELISA profiles showed that RBD-SpyTag monomer and three RBD-conjugated NPs

187

bound to hACE2 and CB6 antibody in a dose-dependent manner. Analogous to

188

soluble RBD-SpyTag monomer, three RBD-conjugated NPs bound to purified hACE2,

189

suggesting that the conformation of RBD monomer was retained on the conjugated

190

nanoparticles (Figure 3A). However, the binding between three RBD-conjugated NPs

191

and CB6 antibody was significantly higher than RBD-SpyTag monomer (Figure 3B).

192

Bio-layer interferometry assay was then applied to further examine the binding

193

kinetics of RBD-conjugated NPs. As illustrated in Figure 3B and 3D, the measured

194

binding affinity constant (kD) of RBD monomer and two RBD-conjugated NPs,

195

RBD-Ferritin NPand RBD-I53-50 NP, with hACE2 receptor were 4.34E-09, 1.74E-08

196

and 1.00E-09 M. However, the dissociation was very slowly between RBD-mi3 NP

197

and hACE2, and kD reached up to 1.0E-12 M, indicating RBD-mi3 NP showed an

198

even higher antigenicity in comparison to RBD-Ferritin NP and RBD-I53-50 NP. The

199

binding kinetics of RBD-conjugated NPs to CB6 antibody were also measured. The

200

binding capability between three RBD-conjugated NPs and CB6 antibody were

201

significantly stronger than RBD monomer (Figure 3C and 3D), suggesting that three

202

RBD-conjugated NPs may showed a higher affinity to specific BCR targeting the

203

RBD of SARS-CoV-2.

Immunogenicity of RBD-conjugated nanoparticles in BALB/c mice

206

To compared the immunogenicity of three RBD-conjugated NPs and soluble

207

monomeric RBD, mice were immunized with 5 μg monomeric RBD or corresponding

208

weights of RBD-mi3 NP, RBD-Ferritin NP and RBD-I53-50 NP with equimolar RBD

209

formulated with 50 % (v/v) AddaVax or SAS adjuvant at weeks 0, 2 and 4 (Figure

210

4A). PBS was used as the negative group. As expected, after prime immunization,

211

almost no binding antibody response was detected in groups immunized with

212

monomeric RBD adjuvanted with both AddaVax and SAS. However, immunized with

213

three RBD-conjugated NPs, RBD-Ferritin, RBD-mi3 and RBD-I53-50, formulated

214

with AddaVax adjuvant elicited 71.8 to 168.4-fold higher binding antibody (ED50:

215

103.8±0.4, 103.9±0.2, 104.2±0.2, respectively) than RBD (ED50: 102.0). Analogous to the the

216

Addvax adjuvant, immunized with RBD-Ferritin, RBD-mi3 and RBD-I53-50

217

adjuvanted with SAS adjuvant induced virtually the same antigen-specific binding

218

antibodies in mice (ED50: 104.1±0.3, 104.0±0.2, 104.3±0.2, respectively) after the prime

219

immunization. Next, the RBD-specific antibody titers were substantially increased

220

among groups immunized with monomeric RBD and three RBD-conjugated NPs in

221

the following 1st boost and 2nd boost immunization. ELISA profiles showed that

222

throughout the whole immunization three RBD-conjugated NPs induced significantly

223

higher RBD-specific binding antibody compared to the monomeric RBD, while the

224

titer levels among groups of RBD-conjugated NPs adjuvanted or groups between the

225

two adjuvants were generally similar (Figure 4B). In order to explore the detailed

226

immune response during immunization, we further evaluated the IgG subtype of the

227

antibody elicited and the results showed that a similar trend of antibody titer among

228

different immunization groups could be observed regardless of subtypes of IgG.

229

Moreover, the titer ratio of IgG1:IgG2a among groups were greater than 1 throughout

230

the whole immunization process, indicating a Th2-favored antibody response

231

(Figure 4B).

28

232

Besides the intensity of antibody production, the neutralizing capability of

233

generated antibody would be another critical factor impacting the quality of

234

immunization. Thus, for further evaluation of immunogenicity of RBD-conjugated

235

NPs, serum competition assay through BLI was performed. Sera of mice immunized

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.03.366138; this version posted November 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

236

with antigen adjuvanted with after 2nd boost was retrieved and mixed within each

237

group for a general evaluation. After serial dilution, sequentially-diluted sera were

238

applied to the RBD captured on the biosensors for blocking. It was observed that sera

239

from RBD-conjugated NPs groups can priorly hinder the binding of ACE2 and CB6

240

antibody to RBD under each dilution level in comparison with the RBD monomer

241

(Figure 4C). As the binding signals were recorded, the non-competing binding curve

242

height Ro and competing binding curve of each dilution level Rc could be used for

243

quantitative analysis. The heatmap of relative competition level of mice sera further

244

displayed that competitive levels of RBD-conjugated NP groups were 4- to 16-fold

245

stronger to the monomeric RBD group (Figure 4D). And as the copies of RBD

246

presented on the surface increased, a stronger competition could be observed when

247

comparing the RBD-Ferritin NP with RBD-I53-50/mi3 NPs. A stronger relative

248

competition level may indicate a more lasting occupation of RBD of the spike protein

249

on the virus intruding and hinder its binding with ACE2 to prevent cell infection,

250

which would further confirmed by neutralizing assays.

251

Neutralization antibody titers were determined in vitro using SARS-CoV-2

252

pseudovirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralizing assays. The neutralization

253

titer of sera collected with the RBD-conjugated nanoparticles formulated with

254

AddaVax adjuvant after the 2nd boost immunized mice was ~10- to 120-fold greater

255

than that of sera from the monomeric RBD control group during SARS-CoV-2

256

pseudovirus-based assay. Analogical result was also observed when immunized with

257

antigen formulated with SAS adjuvant (Figure. 5A). Therefore, we further performed

258

authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus to detected the neutralization activity of sera by method

259

of cytopathic effect (CPE) evaluation and focus reduction test. As shown in Figure.

260

5B, 90 % focus reduction neutralization antibody titers (FRNT90) of post-2nd boost

261

sera from mice immunized with RBD-Ferritin NP, RBD-mi3 NP and RBD-I53-50 NP

262

formulated with AddaVax adjuvant (FRNT90:104.1±0.5, 104.0±0.6, 104.1±0.3, respectively)

263

was ~10- to 40-fold higher than monomeric RBD (FRNT90: 102.1±0.8). As was

264

similar to AddaVax, three RBD-conjugated nanoparticles adjuvanted with SAS also

265

showed significantly higher FRNT90 than RBD monomer (Figure 4B). Otherwise we

266

compared the difference of neutralization activity of sera from all groups after each

267

immunization procedure according the CPE-based microneutralization assay. Results

268

manifested that after the first prime, little neutralizing effect could be observed among

269

all groups. As the immunization procedures progressed, neutralizing effect of sera

270

samples of groups from RBD-conjugated NPs was significantly overwhelming the

271

monomeric RBD group in regardless of adjuvants used. Specially, comparative serum

272

neutralizing activity could be observed after 1st boost for the RBD-conjugated groups

273

while an equal strength of neutralization was postponed to post-2nd boost for

274

monomeric RBD group, during which the neutralizing activities of nanoparticle

275

groups were nearly 10-fold higher. It was interesting to point out that the

276

RBD-Ferritin NP showed a relatively inferior effect compared to the other two

277

nanoparticles when we made a parallel contrast between groups, which was in

278

accordance to the competition assay.

Cellular reponse during the immunization

281

To explore whether a difference in immune cell level of immune response to

282

antigen manipulate the above effect and determine the T cell immune response

283

elicited by RBD-conjugated NPs, analysis of germinal centers (GCs) B cells, T

284

follicular helper (Tfh) cells and immune cells containing intracellular cytokine was

285

performed. Compared to monomeric RBD, analysis of responding cells in draining

286

lymph nodes following a 2nd boost immunization shown that no significant difference

287

was observed in Tfh and GC cell responses when immunized with three

288

RBD-conjugated NPs (Figure S3A and 3B, Supporting Information). In addition,

289

consistent with the RBD-dimer results as previously reported

290

with shaking at 1000 rpm. Signals were collected at a standard frequency as default

571

(5.0 Hz).

572

Kinetic assay: Firstly, the Streptavidin (SA) biosensors (Fortebio) were pre-incubated

573

in PBS (ThermoFisher) containing 0.05 % Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich), the assay

574

buffer used throughout the whole procedures, for 15 minutes. To couple the RBD

575

protein on the biosensors, EZ-link-Sulfo-NHS-biotin biotinylation kit (ThermoFisher)

576

was used to biotinylate the RBD/ACE2/CB6 antibody in the following of the

577

instruction as below.

578

Step1: Calculation of the amount of biotinylation agent used

579

1. Calculate millimoles of biotin reagent to add to the reaction for a 20-fold molar

580

excess:

mg protein mM protein 20 mM Biotin  mM Biotin
mL protein mL
protein mg protein mM protein

581

20 = Molar fold excess of biotin

582

2. Calculate microliters of 10 mM biotin reagent solution to add to the reaction:

mM Biotin
583
584

1,000,000 μL L
10 mM  μL Biotin
L

Step2: Biotinylating

585

Add the calculated amount of 10 mM biotin reagent into the RBD/ACE2/CB6

586

protein in PBS (5 mg/mL, 200 μL) and incubated the reaction system at room

587

temperature for 30 minutes.

Step3: Desalting

589

Equilibrate the desalting column PD-10 (GE Pharmacia) with 10 mL of PBS. After

590

the equilibration, the reaction solution would be added in the column and then washed

591

and eluted with 400 μL PBS separately.

592

To perform kinetic assay, after 60 s baseline, ACE/CB6-biotin protein diluted with the

593

buffer was captured on the SA sensor at 2 μg/mL for 120 s. Then 2 fold-diluting

594

RBD-copy molar concentrations of RBD monomer or different RBD-conjugated NPs

595

were associated to the biosensor for 180 s, followed by a 300 s disassociation and 3

596

rounds of regeneration with 10 mM Glycine pH 1.5. The curve data was analyzed by

597

ForteBio data analysis software. Raw curves aligned at association were adjusted with

598

baseline signals before a 1:1 binding model fitting was performed. Then a global fit to

599

all binding curves was conducted to render overall kinetic parameters (kD, kon, kdis

600

etc.)

601

Serum competition assay: Mice serum from AddaVax-adjuvanted immunization

602

group harvested after 2nd boost were collected and equal volume (5 μL) of sera from

603

each mouse within the same immunogen group was mixed together in representative

604

of overall characteristic of the group. To perform the competition assay, RBD-biotin

605

protein was captured on the biosensor as the above at 5 μg/mL. Then to saturate the

606

RBD, 2 fold-diluting mice sera mixtures from each group and control PBST were

607

loaded to the biosensor for 300 s. After the end of sera loading, 400 mM ACE2 or

608

CB6 antibody were associated to the biosensors for 300 s to detect the competitive

609

binding signal under the saturation of each dilution level of mice sera. Sensors were

610

also regenerated with 10 mM Glycine pH 1.5. Real-time signal data was collected and

611

the competition behavior was displayed by the ACE2/CB6 binding signal of different

612

curves. Binding signal data were retrieved from curve, Ro represented the saturated

613

non-competing binding curve height and Rc represented saturated competing binding

614

curves of each dilution level. Relative competition levels of each serum dilution level

615

could be calculated as (Ro-Rc)/Rc.

618

The SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus were produced as previously described

50

, with

619

some modification. Briefly, gene encoding SARS-CoV-2 S (GenBank: QHU36824.1)

620

with a 19-amino-acids deletion in C-terminal was human codon-optimized and cloned

621

into the expression vector pCMV14-3×Flag, a generously gift from Zhaohui Qian,

622

Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with the

623

plasmids of PsPAX2, pCMV14-SARS-CoV-2 S ΔCT-3×Flag and pLenti-GFP at a

624

ratio 1:2:1 using PEI-MAX (mentioned above). After 5 hours, the supernatant was

625

replaced with fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Sixty hours

626

post-transfection, the supernatant containing SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus were

627

harvested and centrifuged at 4 °C, 3000 g for 10 min to remove cell debris, followed

628

by

629

Guangzhou Jet Bio-Filtration Co., Ltd). Sterile PEG-8000 solution was added to the

630

clarified supernatants and the solution was incubated for 1 hour at 4 °C. The mixture

631

was then centrifuged, concentrated, and resuspended with DMEM for final collection

BALB/c mice immunization

635

Forty-five 6-8 weeks-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from the Beijing

636

Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd, and arbitrarily divided into 9

637

groups. Before immunization, purified immunogen was diluted with PBS and gently

638

formulated with an equal volume of AddaVax™ adjuvant (InvivoGen) or Sigma

639

Adjuvant System (SAS, Sigma), and incubated overnight to achieve full absorption of

640

antigen upon the surface of adjuvant particles at 4 °C with shaking at 40 g. Each

641

group of mice received three immunizations at weeks 0, 2 and 4 via a subcutaneous

642

route. The immunization dose was 5 μg of RBD monomer, or corresponding weights

643

of RBD-conjugated nanoparticle immunogens containing equal molar of RBD as the

644

monomers which were RBD-mi3 (9.51 μg), RBD-Ferritin (9.34 μg) and RBD-I53-50

645

(11.91 μg). PBS were served as a negative control. Blood samples were harvested 10

646

days following each immunization, and were placed at 37 °C for 30 min to reach

647

ample coagulation. Then blood samples were centrifuged at 16,250 g, 4 °C for 10 min

652

Serum ELISA

653

1 μg/mL RBD monomer without SpyTag in PBS was precoated on 96-well

654

maxiSorp ELISA microplates (Corning) overnight at 4 . Plates were blocked with

655

ELISA blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 . Mouse serum samples were 5-fold

656

sequentially diluted with blocking buffer starting at 1:50, and were added to the

657

coated plates, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the plates were washed

658

with PBS-T five times and added with a 1:5000 dilution of HRP-conjugated goat

659

anti-mouse IgG antibody (Promega) in blocking buffer at 37 °C for 45 min. For

660

analysis of RBD- specific IgG isotype titers, a 1:5000 dilution of HRP-conjugated

661

goat anti-mouse IgG1 and IgG2a antibody was incubated at this step. Plates were

662

washed, colored by TMB, and quenched with H2SO4. The absorbance at 450 nm and

663

630 nm of each well was immediately determined by SpectraMax Plus plate reader

664

(Molecular Devices, USA). Results were plotted and fitted by GraphPad Prism 8 and

665

EC50 value were calculated using 4-parameters nonlinear regression fitting from

666

Pseudovirus-based neutralization assay

669

Pseudovirus-based neutralization assay was performed to evaluate the

670

neutralization ability of the sera by immunized mice. In brief, approximately 1.75x104

671

HEK293T-hACE2 cells were seeded onto 96-well culture plates overnight at 37 °C in

672

5 % CO2. Sera were 4-fold serially diluted with complete DMEM medium starting at

673

1:20, and pre-incubated with an equal volume of pseudovirus of SARS-CoV-2 at

674

37 °C for 2 h. The mixtures were then added to the HEK293T-hACE2 cells for

675

infection. After 2 hours incubation, the mixtures were replaced with fresh DMEM

676

medium containing 2 % FBS and 1 % penicillin and streptomycin, and incubated for

677

48 hours at 37 °C, 5 % CO2. Wells treated with only medium or virus without

678

incubation with serum were set as negative control and positive control in each plate,

679

respectively. Afterwards, the cells were lysed with lysis buffer and luciferase activity

680

was immediately measured by dual-glo luciferase assay system (Promega). The

681

inhibition rate was calculated as (sera signals – blank control signals)/ (virus signals –

682

blank control signals) * 100 %. The 90 % neutralization antibody titers (NT90) were

683

determined using 4-parameter s nonlinear regression fitting from fitted curve using

Authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus-based neutralization assay

687

All of microneutralization assay for authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus we used in this

688

study were performed in a BSL-3 facility. Two methods, the authentic SARS-CoV-2

689

virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) and focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT)

690

were used to evaluate the neutralizing antibody titers of sera from immunized mice.

691

Briefly, sera were 4-fold serially diluted starting at 1:4 with DMEM supplemented

692

with 2 % FBS and 1 % penicillin and streptomycin, and mixed with the equal volumes

693

of 100 half tissue culture infective doses (100 TCID50) SARS-CoV-2-virus of

694

2020XN4276 strain at 37 °C for 2 h. Afterwards, the sera-virus mixture was added to

695

pre-plated Vero-E6 cells in 96-well culture plate, and incubated for an additional 96 h

696

at 37 °C in 5 % CO2 to observe the CPE at 40X magnification. Wells with pure virus

697

treated, pure diluted sera treated or cell only was set as controls for each plate. Virus

698

back titration was performed in each plate. All diluted serum samples were tested in

699

duplicate. The neutralization antibody titers of all of sera were defined as the

700

reciprocal of serum dilution that could neutralize 50 % of virus infection at 4 days

701

post-infection.

702

As for the FRNT method, serum samples were 5-fold serially diluted starting at

703

1:10, and mixed with the equal volumes of 100 focus forming unit (FFU)

704

SARS-CoV-2 virus of human CHN/IQTC01/2020 strain in 96-well culture plate, and

705

incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The mixtures were then added to the 96-well plates that
