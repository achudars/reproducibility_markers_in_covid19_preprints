Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a significant dilemma for governments across the
globe. The public health consequences of inaction are catastrophic; but the economic
consequences of drastic action are likewise catastrophic. Governments must therefore
strike a balance in the face of these trade-offs. But with critical uncertainty about how
to find such a balance, they are forced to experiment with their interventions and await
the results of their experimentation. Models have proved inaccurate because behavioral
response patterns are either not factored in or are hard to predict. One crucial
behavioral response in a pandemic is adaptive social contact: potentially infectious
contact between people is deliberately reduced either individually or by fiat; and this
must be balanced against the economic cost of having fewer people in contact and
therefore active in the labor force. We develop a model for adaptive optimal control of
the effective social contact rate within a Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS)
epidemic model using a dynamic utility function with delayed information. This utility
function trades off the population-wide contact rate with the expected cost and risk of
increasing infections. Our analytical and computational analysis of this simple
discrete-time deterministic model reveals the existence of a non-zero equilibrium,
oscillatory dynamics around this equilibrium under some parametric conditions, and
complex dynamic regimes that shift under small parameter perturbations. These results
support the supposition that infectious disease dynamics under adaptive
behavior-change may have an indifference point, may produce oscillatory dynamics
without other forcing, and constitute complex adaptive systems with associated
dynamics. Implications for COVID-19 include an expectation of fluctuations, for a
considerable time, around a quasi-equilibrium that balances public health and economic
priorities, that shows multiple peaks and surges in some scenarios, and that implies a
high degree of uncertainty in mathematical projections.

economic costs of reducing social contacts and the public health costs of neglecting to
do so. Such tradeoffs introduce an interactive, iterative mechanism which adds
complexity to an infectious disease system. Consequently, infectious disease modeling
typically has not included dynamic behavior change that must address such a tradeoff.
Here, we develop a theoretical model that introduces lost or gained economic and public
health utility through the adjustment of social contact rates with delayed information.
We find this model produces an equilibrium, a point of indifference where the tradeoff is
neutral, and at which a disease will be endemic for a long period of time. Under small
perturbations, this model exhibits complex dynamic regimes, including oscillatory
behavior, runaway exponential growth, and eradication. These dynamics suggest that
for epidemic response that relies on social contact reduction, secondary waves and
surges with accompanied business re-closures and shutdowns may be expected, and that
accurate projection under such circumstances is unlikely.

The COVID-19 pandemic had infected almost 9 million people and caused over 450,000
deaths worldwide as of June 23, 2020 [1]. In the absence of effective therapies and
vaccines [2], many governments responded with lock-down policies and social distancing
laws to reduce the rate of social contacts and curb transmission of the virus. Prevalence
of COVID-19 in the wake of these policies in the United States indicates they may have
been successful at decreasing the reproduction number (Rt ) of the epidemic [1].
However, they have also led to economic recession with an unemployment rate at an
80-year peak, the stock market in decline, and the federal government forced to borrow
heavily to financially support businesses and households. Solutions to these economic
crises may conflict with public health recommendations. Thus, governments worldwide
must decide how to balance the economic and public health consequences of their
epidemic response interventions.
Behavior-change in response to an epidemic, whether autonomously adopted by
individuals or externally directed by governments, affects the dynamics of infectious
diseases [3, 4]. Prominent examples of behavior-change in response to infectious disease
prevalence include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination choices [5], social
distancing in influenza outbreaks [6], condom purchases in HIV-affected communities [7],
and social distancing during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [2]. Behavior is
endogenous to an infectious disease system because it is, in part, a consequence of the
prevalence of the disease, which in turn responds to changes in behavior [8, 9].
Individuals and governments have greater incentive to change behavior as prevalence
increases; conversely they have reduced incentive as prevalence decreases [10, 11].
Endogenous behavioral response may then theoretically produce a non-zero endemic
equilibrium of infection. This happens because, at low levels of prevalence, the cost of
avoidance of a disease may be higher than the private benefit to the individual, even
though the collective, public benefit in the long-term may be greater. However, in
epidemic response we typically think of behavior-change as an exogenously-induced
intervention without considering associated costs. While guiding positive change is an
important intervention, neglecting to recognize the endogeneity of behavior can lead to
a misunderstanding of incentives and a resurgence of the epidemic when behavior
change is reversed prematurely.
Although there is growing interest in the role of adaptive human behavior in
infectious disease dynamics, there is still a lack of general understanding of the most
important properties of such systems [3, 8, 12]. Behavior is difficult to measure, quantify,
or predict [8], in part, due to the complexity and diversity of human beings who make
different choices under different circumstances. Despite these challenges, modelers and

mathematicians have adopted a variety of strategies to investigate the importance of
behavior (see Funk et al., 2010 [4] for a general review). For example, an early
expansion of the Kermack-McKendrick susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model
simply allowed the transmission parameter (Î²) to be a negative function of the number
infected, effectively introducing an intrinsic negative feedback to the infected class that
regulated the disease [13].
Modelers have used a variety of tools, including agent-based modeling [14], network
structures for the replacement of central nodes when sick [15] or for behavior-change as
a social contagion process [16], game theoretic descriptions of rational choice under
changing incentives as with vaccination [6, 11, 17], and a branching process for
heterogeneous agents and the effect of behavior during the West Africa Ebola epidemic
in 2014 [18]. A common approach to incorporating behavior into epidemic models is to
track co-evolving dynamics of behavior and infection [16, 19, 20], where behavior
represents an i-state of the model [21]. In a compartmental model, this could mean
separate compartments (and transitions therefrom) for susceptible individuals in a state
of fear and those not in a state of fear [16].
Periodicity (i.e. multi-peak dynamics) has long been documented empirically in
epidemiology [22, 23]. Periodicity can be driven by seasonal contact rate changes (e.g.
when children are in school) [24], seasonality in the climate or ecology [25], sexual
behavior change [26], and host immunity cycling through new births of susceptibles or a
decay of immunity over time. Some papers in nonlinear dynamics have studied delay
differential equations in the context of epidemic dynamics and found periodic
solutions [27]. Although it is atypical to include delay in modeling, delay is an
important feature of epidemics. For example, if behavior responds to mortality rates,
there will inevitably be a lag with an average duration of the incubation period plus the
life expectancy upon becoming infected. In a tightly interdependent system, reacting to
outdated information can result in an irrational response and periodic cycling.
A delay in a behavioral response to an epidemic can take a variety of forms. In the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, for example, there have been delays in the international
recognition of the outbreak, delays in the identification of the virus, delays in the
acquisition of reliable information on suspected and confirmed cases, delays in the
development and deployment of testing, delays in the launching of community
information and communication campaigns, and delays in laying the physical
infrastructure for the treatment and isolation of an increasing number of patients.
Health authorities have had to wait up to 14 days to see the epidemiological
consequences of public gatherings, opening of businesses, and guidelines and policies
regarding personal protective equipment. Recognizing the effects of such delays as a
part of the endogenous relationship between disease and behavior is important to
improved understanding of the complexity of disease dynamics.
The original epidemic model of Kermack and McKendrick [28] was first expressed in
discrete time. Then by allowing âthe subdivisions of time to increase in number so that
each interval becomes very smallâ the famous differential equations of the SIR epidemic
model were derived. Here we begin with a discrete-time Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible
model that is adjusted on the principle of endogenous behavior-change through an
adaptive social-contact rate that can be thought of as either individually motivated or
institutionally imposed. We introduce a dynamic utility function that motivates the
populationâs effective contact rate at a particular time period. This utility function is
based on information about the epidemic size that may not be current. This leads to a
time delay in the contact function that increases the complexity of the population
dynamics of the infection. Results from the discrete-time model show that the system
approaches an equilibrium in many cases, although small parameter perturbations can
lead the dynamics to enter qualitatively distinct regimes. The analogous

continuous-time model retains periodicities for some sets of parameters, but numerical
investigation shows that the continuous time version is much better behaved than the
discrete-time model. This dynamical behavior is similar to models of ecological
population dynamics, and a useful mathematical parallel is drawn between these
systems.

SIS

111

To represent endogenous behavior-change, we start with the classical discrete-time
susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model [28], which, when incidence is relatively
small compared to the total population [29, 30], can be written in terms of the recursions
St+1 = St â b St It + Î³It

(1)

It+1 = It + b St It â Î³It

(2)

St + It = Nt ,

(3)

where at time t, St represents the number of susceptible individuals, It the infected
individuals, and Nt the number of individuals that make up the population, which is
assumed fixed in a closed population. We can therefore write N for the constant
population size. Here Î³, with 0 < Î³ < 1, is the rate of removal from I to S due to
recovery. This model in its simplest form assumes random mixing, where the parameter
b represents a composite of the average contact rate and the disease-specific
transmissibility given a contact event. In order to introduce human behavior, we
substitute for b a time-dependent bt , which is a function of both b0 , the probability that
disease transmission takes place on contact, and a dynamic social rate of contact ct
whose optimal value, cât , is determined at each time t as in economic epidemiological
models [31], namely
bt = b0 cât ,

where cât represents the optimal contact rate, defined as the number of contacts per unit
time that maximize utility for the individual. Here, cât is a function of the number of
infected in the population according to the perceived risks and benefits of social
contacts, which we model as a utility function, assuming there is a constant utility
independent of contact, a utility loss associated with infection, and a utility derived
from the choice of number of daily contacts with a penalty for deviating from the choice
of contacts which would yield the most utility.

when NI b0 is small and c NI b0 << 1. We thus assume NI (b0 ) is small, and approximate
U (c) in Eq. 5 using Eq. 6. Eq. 5 assumes a strictly negative relationship between
number of infecteds and contact.
We assume an individual or government will balance the cost of infection, the
probability of infection, and the cost of deviating from the target contact rate cÌ to select
an optimal contact rate cât , namely the number of contacts, which takes into account the
risk of infection and the penalty for deviating from the target contact rate. This
captures the idea that individuals trade off how many people they want to interact with
versus their risk of getting sick, or that authorities want to reopen the economy during a
pandemic and have to trade off morbidity and mortality from increasing infections with
the need to allow additional social contacts to help the economy restart. This optimal
contact rate can be calculated by finding the maximum of U with respect to c from Eq.

SIR

168

For the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) version of the model, we include the
removed category and write the (discrete-time) recursion system as
St+1 = St â bt St It
It+1 = It + bt St It â Î³It
Rt+1 = Rt + Î³It ,

(13)
(14)
(15)

where Rt = N â It â St , bt = b0 cât with b0 the baseline contact rate and cât specified by
Eq. 10. With bt = b, say, and not changing over time, Eqs. 13â15 form the discrete-time
version of the classical Kermack-McKendrick SIR model [28]. The inclusion of the
removed category entails that IË = 0 is the only equilibrium of the system Eqs. 13â15;
unlike the SIS model, there is no equilibrium with infecteds present. In general, since cât
includes the delay â, the dynamic approach to IË = 0 is expected to be quite complex.
Intuitively, since the infecteds are ultimately removed, we do expect that from any
initial frequency I0 of infecteds all N individuals will eventually be in the R category.
Numerical analysis of this SIR model shows strong similarity between the SIS and SIR
models for several hundred time steps before the SIR model converges to IË = 0 with
R = N . In the section âNumerical Iteration and Continuous-Time Analogâ we compare
the numerical iteration of the SIS (Eq. 11) and SIR (Eqs. 13â15) and integration of the
continuous-time (differential equation) versions of the SIS and SIR models.

To determine the dynamic trajectories of (11) without time delay, we first solve for the

Stability of the equilibria

198

Assessing global asymptotic stability in epidemic models is an important task of
mathematical epidemiology [34, 35]. The three equilibria of the SIS recursion (11) are
qualitatively different. IË = 0 corresponds to a disease-free population; I â is greater than
N and is therefore illegitimate; IË is the only positive legitimate equilibrium if
cÌb0 > Î³/N and is, therefore, the most interesting for the asymptotic stability behavior
of the epidemic. Mathematical stability analysis of recursion (11) is complicated
because of the delay term â. However, from (11), if N cÌb0 > Î³, the disease-free
equilibrium IË = 0 is locally unstable, and in this case IË is indeed legitimate.
Local stability of IË in (18) is discussed in detail in the Appendix. First, in the
d
absence of delay (i.e., â = 0), IË is locally stable if dI

known that iterations of discrete-time recursive relations, of which (12) is an example
(i.e., with â = 0), may produce cycles or chaos depending on the parameters and the
starting frequency I0 of infecteds.
Table 1 shows an array of possible asymptotic dynamics with â = 0 found by
numerical iteration of (12) for a specific set of parameters and an initial frequency
I0 = 1 infected individual. Included in Table 1 are examples for which, beginning with a
single infected, the number of infecteds explodes, becoming unbounded; of course, this is
an illegitimate trajectory since It cannot exceed N . However, in the case marked â, IË is

Numerical Iteration and Continuous-Time Analog

229

We begin with numerical analysis of the discrete-time SIS recursion (11), which includes
Ë with
the delay parameter â. Local stability properties of the equilibrium state I,
0 < IË < N , are shown in the Appendix under the assumption N cÌb0 > Î³, which also
entails that the disease-free equilibrium IË = 0 is locally unstable. In the recursion (11),
the number of infecteds at time t will not, in general, be integers, as they would be in
an actual epidemic. Further, the dynamics of It under such a recursion can be very
sensitive to the starting condition I0 , the size of the time delay â, and the parameters:
Ë namely whether It converges to IË from a
N, b0 , Î³, cÌ, and Î±. The local stability of I,
Ë may tell you little about the actual trajectory of
starting number of infecteds close to I,
It from other starting conditions.
Table 1 reports an array of dynamic trajectories for some choices of parameters and,
in two cases, an initial number of infecteds other than I0 = 1. The first three rows show
three sets of parameters for which the equilibrium values of IË are very similar but the
trajectories of It are different: a two-point cycle, a four-point cycle, and apparently
Ë In all of these cases, df (I)/dI| Ë < â1. Clearly the

I=I
dynamics are sensitive to the target contact rate cÌ in these cases. The fourth and eighth
rows show that It becomes unbounded (tends to +â) from I0 = 1, but a two-point
Ë df (I)/dI| Ë < â1 in this case. For the
cycle is approached if I0 is close enough to I:
I=I
Ë
parameters in the ninth row, if I0 is close enough to IË there is damped oscillation into I:
here â1 < df (I)/dI|I=IË < 0.
The fifth and sixth rows of Table 1 exemplify another interesting dynamic starting
from I0 = 1. It becomes larger than IË (overshoots) and then converges monotonically
Ë in each case 0 < df (I)/dt| Ë < 1. For the parameters in the seventh row,
down to I;
I=I
there is oscillatory convergence to IË from I0 = 1 (â1 < df (I)/dI|I=IË < 0), while in the
Ë
last row there is straightforward monotone convergence to I.
A continuous-time analog of the discrete-time recursion (11), in the form of a
differential equation, substitutes dI/dt for It+1 â It in (11). We then solve the resulting
delay differential equation numerically using the VODE differential equation integrator
in SciPy [36, 37] (source code available at https://github.com/yoavram/SanJose). Using
the parameters in Table 2, Figures 1â4 compare the effect of the parameters on the
trajectories of the discrete-time and continuous-time SIS model specified in (11). The
number of time steps used in the computations illustrated in these figures is less than
250 in each case. In Figure 2 the delay is â = 2 while Figures 3 and 4 have delay â = 3.

converge to R = N with no infecteds. Comparing the short-run figures with the
long-run figures, the former are not good predictors of the latter in the SIR setting. The
short-run behavior of the discrete-time model usually involves a great deal of cycling,
which is difficult to see on the longer time scales. Supplementary Figs. S5S and S5L
describe the SIR dynamics for the SIS version in Fig. 2, panel (a), with I0 = 1. Figs.
S5S and S5L show the SIR versions of this figure run for a short and long time,

respectively. In Fig. S5S there appears to be convergence to I,
about 500 time units, in both discrete- and continuous-time SIR versions, the number of
infected begins to decline towards zero.
It is worth noting that if the total population size of N decreases over time, for
example, if we take N (t) = N exp(âzt), with z = 50b0 cÌÎ³, then the short-term dynamics
of the SIS model in (11) begins to closely resemble the SIR version. This is illustrated
in Supplementary Fig. S5N, where b0 , cÌ, Î³ are, as in Figs. S5S and S5L, the same as in
Fig. 2, panel (a). With N decreasing to zero, both S and I will approach zero in the
SIS model, which explain its apparent similarity to the SIR model, where S and I
approach zero as R approaches N .

This simple model of adaptive social contact produces two possible equilibria, one where
there are zero infecteds, and the disease is eradicated, and a non-zero one between zero
and N , the population size. These equilibria are stable under different conditions.
Further, dynamics produced by this model are complex and subject to regime shifts
across thresholds in the initial conditions and parameter settings. These dynamics
include damped oscillation to the equilibrium, periodic oscillation, chaotic oscillation,
and regression to positive or negative infinity.
Our model makes a number of simplifying assumptions. We assume, for example,
that all individuals in the population will respond in the same fashion to government
policy. We assume that governments choose a uniform contact rate according to an
optimized utility function, which is homogeneous across all individuals in the population.
Finally, we assume that the utility function is symmetric around the optimal number of
contacts so that increasing or decreasing contacts above or below the target contact
rate, respectively, yield the same reduction in utility. These assumptions allowed us to
create the simplest possible model that includes adaptive behavior and time delay. In
Hollingâs heuristic distinction in ecology between tactical models, models built to be
parameterized and predictive, and strategic models, which aim to be as simple as
possible to highlight phenomenological generalities, this is a strategic model [38].
We note that the five distinct kinds of dynamical trajectories seen in these
computational experiments come from a purely deterministic recursion. This means
that oscillations and even erratic, near-chaotic dynamics and collapse in an epidemic
may not necessarily be due to seasonality, complex agent-based interactions, changing or
stochastic parameter values, demographic change, host immunity, or socio-cultural
idiosyncracies. This dynamical behavior in number of infecteds can result from
mathematical properties of a simple deterministic system with homogeneous endogenous
behavior-change, similar to complex population dynamics of biological organisms [39].
The mathematical consistency with population dynamics suggests a parallel in ecology,
that the indifference point for human behavior functions in a similar way to a carrying
capacity in ecology, below which a population will tend to grow and above which a
population will tend to shrink. For example, the Ricker Equation [40], commonly used
in population dynamics to describe the growth of fish populations, exhibits similar
complex dynamics and qualitative state thresholds. The existence of a non-zero, locally
stable equilibrium in our model is consistent with economic epidemiology theory: if

individuals are incentivized to change their behavior to protect themselves, they will,
and they will cease to do this when they are not [10]. Further, our results show certain
parameter sets can lead to limit-cycle dynamics, consistent with other negative feedback
mechanisms with time delays [41, 42]. This is because the system is reacting to
conditions that were true in the past, but not necessarily true in the present. In our
discrete-time model, there is the added complexity that the non-zero equilibrium may
be locally stable but not attained from a wide range of initial conditions, including the
most natural one, namely a single infected individual.
Observed epidemic curves of many transient disease outbreaks typically inflect and
go extinct, as opposed to this model that may oscillate perpetually or converge
monotonically or cyclically to an endemic disease equilibrium. Our model is meant to
demonstrate what effect incentives can have on infectious disease dynamics. Including
institutional and public efforts that are incentivized to eradicate, rather than to
optimize utility trade-offs, would alter the dynamics to look more like real-world
epidemic curves. This may have a useful implication for policy. For example, beyond
infectious diseases that remain endemic to society, outbreaks may also flare up once or
multiple times, such as the double-peaked outbreaks of SARS in three countries in
2003 [43], and surges in fluctuations in COVID-19 cases globally [1]. There may be
many causes for such double-peaked outbreaks, one of which may be a lapse in
behavior-change after the epidemic begins to die down due to decreasing incentives [16],
as represented in our simple theoretical model. This is consistent with findings that
voluntary vaccination programs suffer from decreasing incentives to participate as
prevalence decreases [44, 45]. It should be noted that the continuous-time version of our
model can support a stable cyclic epidemic whose interpretation in empirical terms will
depend on the time scale, and hence on the meaning of the delay, â.
One of the responsibilities of infectious disease modelers (e.g. COVID-19 modelers)
is to predict and project forward what epidemics will do in the future in order to better
assist in the proper and strategic allocation of preventative resources. COVID-19
models have often proved wrong by orders of magnitude because they lack the means to
account for adaptive response. An insight from this model, however, is that prediction
becomes very difficult, perhaps impossible, if we allow for adaptive behavior-change
because the system is qualitatively sensitive to small differences in values of key
parameters. These parameters are very hard to measure precisely; they change
depending on the disease system and context and their inference is generally subject to
large errors. Further, we donât know how policy-makers weight the economic trade-offs
against the public health priorities (i.e., the ratio between Î±1 and Î±2 in our model) to
arrive at new policy recommendations.
To maximize the ability to predict and minimize loss of life or morbidity, outbreak
response should not only seek to minimize the reproduction number, but also the length
of time taken to gather and distribute information. Another approach would be to use a
predetermined strategy for the contact rate, as opposed to a contact rate that depends
on the number of infecteds.
In our model, complex dynamic regimes occur more often when there is a time delay.
If behavior-change arises from fear and fear is triggered by high local mortality and high
local prevalence, such delays seem plausible since death and incubation periods are
lagging epidemiological indicators. Lags mean that people can respond sluggishly to an
unfolding epidemic crisis, but they also mean that people can abandon protective
behaviors prematurely. Developing approaches to incentivize protective behavior
throughout the duration of any lag introduced by the natural history of the infection (or
otherwise) should be a priority in applied research. This paper represents a first step in
understanding endogenous behavior-change and time-lagged protective behavior, and we
anticipate further developments along these lines that could incorporate long incubation

In principle there are â + 1 real or complex roots of (A8), which we represent as

Îµt = c1 Î»t1 + c2 Î»t2 + Â· Â· Â· + câ+1 Î»tâ+1 ,

where A and B are the corresponding terms on the right side of (A2). Eq. (A7) is a
homogeneous linear recursion, since, given IË and all the parameters, A and B are
constants with respect to time. Local stability of IË is then determined by the properties
of recursion (A7), whose solution first involves solving its characteristic equation

of these is less than unity.
In Table 2, results of numerically iterating the complete recursion (11) are listed for
the delay â varying from â = 0 to â = 4, all starting from I0 = 1, with N = 10, 000
and the stated parameters. Figure 3 illustrates the discrete- and continuous-time
dynamics summarized in Table 2. With these values, IË = 35.7180 and we obtain
A = 0.9997 and B = â0.6673. Then, for â = 0, Eq. (A7) gives Îµt = 0.3324Îµtâ1 , which
entails that convergence to IË is locally monotone. With â = 1, the characteristic
polynomial is a quadratic,

1.1109, greater than 1. Thus for both â = 3 and 4, IË cannot be locally stable, and for
these delay times the recursion can oscillate wildly becoming negatively and positively
unbounded for some starting values I0 .

which has one real root 0.6383 and complex roots 0.8190 Â± 0.6122i. Here the modulus of
the complex roots is 1.0225, which is greater than unity so that IË is not locally stable.
In this case the dynamics depend on the initial value I0 . If I0 < 72, It oscillates but not
in a stable cycle. If I0 > 73, the oscillation becomes unbounded.
