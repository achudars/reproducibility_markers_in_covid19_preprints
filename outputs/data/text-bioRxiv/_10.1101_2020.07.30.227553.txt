SUMMARY
Mitochondrial DNA (MT-DNA) are intrinsically inflammatory nucleic acids released by
damaged solid organs. Whether the appearance of cell-free MT-DNA is linked to poor
COVID-19 outcomes remains undetermined. Here, we quantified circulating MT-DNA in
prospectively collected, cell-free plasma samples from 97 subjects with COVID-19 at
the time of hospital presentation. Circulating MT-DNA were sharply elevated in patients
who eventually died, required ICU admission or intubation. Multivariate regression
analysis revealed that high circulating MT-DNA levels is an independent risk factor for
all of these outcomes after adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities. Additionally, we
found that circulating MT-DNA has a similar or superior area-under-the curve when
compared to clinically established measures of systemic inflammation, as well as
emerging markers currently of interest as investigational targets for COVID-19
therapy. These results show that high circulating MT-DNA levels is a potential indicator
for poor COVID-19 outcomes.

INTRODUCTION

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has resulted in a global
health emergency, causing considerable strain on economic, social and medical
systems (Lipman et al., 2020). COVID-19 presents in a wide spectrum of severity.
Although most patients develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, others require
prolonged hospitalization, ICU care and intubation for respiratory support. In severe
cases, patients can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytokine
storm, multi-organ failure and death (Lipman et al., 2020). Although the underlying
mechanisms of severe COVID-19 illness remain unclear, it appears to be exacerbated
by an over-exuberant innate immune response (Vabret et al., 2020). These
observations have led to several ongoing clinical trials targeting components of the
innate immune response such as inflammatory cytokine signaling and complement
activation (Maes et al., 2020; Rilinger et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2020).

Previous work has established that viral infection can trigger cellular necrosis, which in
turn inhibits viral replication along with amplifying anti-viral immune responses through
the release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (Nailwal and Chan,
2019). DAMPs in particular are potent triggers of innate responses through their
engagement of pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLR) that drive
the expression of inflammatory cytokines and presentation of viral antigens (Kulkarni et
al., 2020a). Mitochondrial DNA (MT-DNA) is a member of a group of mitochondrial
DAMPs (MT-DAMPs) released by injured or dying cells and is recognized by TLR9 due

to encoded hypomethylated CpG motifs reminiscent of an ancestral bacterial origin
(Zhang et al., 2010). MT-DNA levels have been previously shown to be elevated in the
plasma of patients that develop ARDS and multi-organ dysfunction during sepsis, as
well as during sterile injury including trauma, hemorrhagic shock and ischemiareperfusion (Faust et al., 2020; Hauser et al., 2010; Nakahira et al., 2013; Puskarich et
al., 2012; Scozzi et al., 2019; Simmons et al., 2013). The release of MT-DNA is often
accompanied by the release of other MT-DAMPs, such as N-formylated peptides,
cytochrome c and cardiolipin, which collectively engage multiple TLRs and the Nformylated peptide receptor-1 that in turn not only induce inflammatory cytokine
expression (Grazioli and Pugin, 2018; Wu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2014) but also the
generation of reactive oxygen species and the facilitation of neutrophil trafficking and
activation (Dorward et al., 2017; Nakayama and Otsu, 2018; Scozzi et al., 2019).
Through these effects, MT-DAMPs can directly contribute to acute lung injury and
systemic inflammation (Zhang et al., 2010). Given that ARDS secondary to SARS-CoV2 infection is also linked with lung tissue injury and immune cell activation (Mangalmurti
and Hunter, 2020), we asked if elevated levels of circulating MT-DNA could be used as
a risk indicator for the development of severe illness.

Here, we demonstrate that COVID-19 patients with high circulating levels of MT-DNA
are more likely to require ICU level care and intubation and are at heightened risk of
death. In addition, MT-DNA quantitation as predictor of poor COVID-19 outcomes is
comparable or better than inflammation indicators commonly used in current clinical
practice, as well as certain emerging immune markers.

RESULTS

Participants and Descriptive Data
A total of 107 subjects were assessed for eligibility from 3/26/2020 to 4/26/2020. Of
these, 97 adult subjects with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in our study
(Table 1, Figure 1). 10 subjects were excluded as they did not have samples from the
day of presentation. The median age of the population in our study was 65 (54-73).
Among these subjects, 55.6% (54/97) were male, 77.3% (75/97) were AfricanAmerican, 46.4% (45/97) were obese (BMI ≥ 30), and 46.3% (45/97) had a positive
smoking history. The median follow up time was 81 days (74-87).

Outcome Data
The primary outcome of mortality was observed in 25.8% (25/97) subjects in our study
(Table 1). Those who died were older [76.2 versus 61.1 years, OR 1.08 (1.04-1.13), p =
0.0003], were more likely to be smokers [64% versus 40.3%, OR 2.63 (1.04-7), p =
0.04] and have a higher proportion of type 2 diabetes mellitus [72% versus 45.8%, OR
3.04 (1.17-8.64), p = 0.02], coronary artery disease [48% versus 19.4%, OR 3.8 (1.4410.34), p = 0.007], and 2 or more comorbidities [84% versus 56.9%, OR 5.54 (1.7224.91, p = 0.009] on univariate analysis (Table 1).

56.7% of subjects with COVID-19 (55/97, Table 2) required an ICU admission. These
subjects were older [71 versus 54.4, OR 1.1 (1.06-1.15), p <0.0001] and were more
likely to have type 2 diabetes mellitus [65.5% versus 35.7%, OR 3.41 (1.49-8.07), p =

0.004], and 2 or more comorbidities [72.7% versus 52.4%, OR 2.66 (1.14-6.38), p =
0.02]. 25.8% (25/97) required invasive mechanical ventilation as a treatment for acute
respiratory failure. The main clinical characteristic associated with higher risk for
intubation was age, with a median of 70 years for intubated subjects compared with 61
years for non-intubated subjects [OR 1.05 (1.01-1.09), p = 0.005] on univariate
analysis, Table 3].

MAIN RESULTS
COVID-19 patients with high circulating MT-DNA are at higher risk for mortality
To assess MT-DNA levels in COVID-19 patients we utilized a previously established insitu quantitative PCR method (Scozzi et al., 2019) to measure the accumulation of
fragments derived from the mitochondrial encoded gene cytochrome b (MT-CYTB)
within cell-free circulating plasma. Plasma MT-CYTB levels were elevated in those
subjects who died from COVID-19 [7.881 (6.897 - 8.488, n=25)] compared to those who
survived [7.082 (6.650 - 7.693), n=72, p=0.009, Figure 2A] and were associated with an
increased risk for mortality on univariate logistic regression (OR 1.960, 95% CI 1.236 3.28, p = 0.006). For MT-CYTB, area under the curve (AUC) for mortality was 0.68
(95% CI 0.54 – 0.81, Figure 2B). On multivariable logistic regression, plasma MT-CYTB
levels remained an independent risk factor for mortality when adjusted for age, sex and
2 or more comorbidities (ORadj, 1.92, 95% CI 1.154 - 3.355, p = 0.015, Table 4).

COVID-19 patients with high circulating MT-DNA are likely to require ICU admission
and intubation

Plasma MT-CYTB levels were elevated in those subjects with COVID-19 who required
an ICU admission [7.779 (6.882 - 8.257), n=55] compared to those who were not
admitted to the ICU [6.856 (6.544 - 7.293), p<0.0001, n=42, Figure 3A]. MT-CYTB
levels were associated with ICU admission on univariate logistic regression (OR 3.335,
95% CI 1.890 - 6.564, p < 0.001). For MT-CYTB, AUC for ICU admission was 0.75
(95%CI 0.65 – 0.85, Figure 3B). On multivariable logistic regression, plasma MT-CYTB
levels remained an independent risk factor for ICU admission after adjusting for age,
sex and 2 or more comorbidities (ORadj, 3.146, 95% CI 1.652 - 6.972, p = 0.002, Table
5). Notably, we also made similar findings for another mitochondrial DNA encoded gene
MT-COX3 (Figure S1D and E, ORadj for age, sex and 2 or more comorbidities, 1.561,
95% CI 1.170 - 2.188, p = 0.005, AUC of COX3 for ICU admission 0.69, 95% CI 0.58 0.79).

Similarly, plasma MT-CYTB levels were elevated in those subjects with COVID-19 who
required intubation [8.192 (7.830 - 9.101, n=25)] versus those who did not require
intubation [6.963 (6.603 - 7.597), n=72, p<0.0001, Figure 4A]. Plasma MT-CYTB levels
were associated with intubation on univariate logistic regression (OR 6.251, 95% CI
3.010 - 16.110, p < 0.0001). For MT-CYTB, AUC for intubation was 0.86 (95%CI 0.76 –
0.95, Figure 4B). On multivariable logistic regression, plasma MT-CYTB levels
remained an independent risk factor for intubation (ORadj, 5.881, 95% CI 2.814 - 15.520,
p < 0.0001, Table 6). Similar findings were observed with MT-COX3 [Figure S1F and
S1G, ORadj for age, sex and 2 or more comorbidities, 2.759, 95% CI 1.791 - 4.921, p <
0.0001, AUC for intubation 0.80 (95% CI 0.69 - 0.91)].

Circulating MT-DNA levels show similar or improved accuracy over clinically established
measurements of inflammation typically used in COVID-19 patients
Plasma MT-CYTB levels had a similar AUC for mortality when compared to LDH, ferritin
or D-dimer levels, and were better than CRP drawn within the first 24 hours of
presentation (Figure 5A). Importantly, the AUC for plasma MT-CYTB levels was
superior to CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer levels when predicting the need for an ICU
admission (Figure 5B) or intubation (Figure 5C). A similar pattern was identified for
MT-COX3 when compared to CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer levels for predicting the
need for an ICU admission (Figure S2B) but was superior to these clinically utilized
markers for the need for intubation (Figure S2C).

Circulating MT-DNA levels correlate with other emerging markers of COVID-19 severity
Plasma MT-CYTB levels moderately correlated with concurrently measured levels of IL6, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 [r=0.389, 95% CI 0.194
– 0.554, p = 0.0001, n=92, Figure 6A]. Similarly, MT-CYTB levels highly correlated with
plasma sC5b-9, which is a marker of complement activation and suggests the formation
of a membrane attack complex (MAC) [r=0.49, 95% CI 0.31 – 0.63, p < 0.0001,
n=95, Figure 6B]. MT-CYTB also correlated with the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio
[r=0.37, 95% CI 0.17 – 0.54, p = 0.0003, n=90, Figure 6C]. Plasma MT-CYTB levels
had a similar or/improved accuracy compared to IL-6 for mortality (Figure S3A), ICU
admission (Figure S3B) and intubation (Figure S3C).

We also observed significant correlations with other biomarkers that have been
implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 such as MIG [r=0.31, 95% CI 0.11 – 0.49, p
= 0.002, n=93, Figure S4A], MCP-1 [r=0.25, 95% CI 0.04 – 0.44, p = 0.01,

95% CI 0.08 – 0.46, p = 0.005, n=94, Figure S4E]. Similarly, the levels of HGF highly
correlated with MT-CYTB in COVID-19 [r=0.47, 95% CI 0.29 –0.62, p < 0.0001,
n=94, Figure S4F].

DISCUSSION

Here we observe that high levels of circulating MT-DNA are an early independent risk
factor for severe illness and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, after
adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities. Importantly, we made similar findings for two
MT-DNA genes, MT-CYTB and MT-COX3, although the latter target did not reach
significance for mortality risk. The reasons for this incongruence are not clear. However,
when compared to MT-CYTB, we generally detected lower copy numbers for MT-COX3,
suggesting the possibility that this part of mitochondria genome is more intrinsically
unstable when exposed to plasma (Scozzi et al., 2019).

Although our studies were not specifically designed to identify the mechanisms that
drive peripheral blood MT-DNA accumulation, significant correlations between LDH and
IL-6 with MT-DNA levels point to a potential deleterious role for cellular necrosis in
COVID-19 pathophysiology. LDH release and IL-6 production are reported indicators of
cellular necrosis (Chan et al., 2013; Vanden Berghe et al., 2006). A specific form of
necrosis, necroptosis, has been demonstrated to induce the release of damaged
mitochondria (Maeda and Fadeel, 2014). Necroptosis is characterized by the eventual
loss of plasma membrane integrity due to the kinase activity of the receptor-interacting
proteins (RIPK)1 and RIPK3 (He et al., 2009) and has been reported to act as a host
defense mechanism when apoptotic death pathways are disabled by viral infection (Cho
et al., 2009). For example, in a mouse model of influenza infection, necroptosis was
shown to inhibit viral replication but with deleterious consequences to bronchial
epithelial integrity (Rodrigue-Gervais et al., 2014). In humans, both H5N1 and H1N1

influenza-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome have been shown to be
associated with necrotic cell death within the distal pulmonary epithelia (Gu and
Korteweg, 2007; Mauad et al., 2010). Intriguingly, the accessory protein open reading
frame 3a (Orf3a) expressed within the highly related SARS-CoV-1 genome has been
recently demonstrated to induce necroptosis through activating RIPK3 (Yue et al.,
2018). SARS-CoV-2 also expresses an Orf3a accessory protein (Bojkova et al., 2020).
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 Orf3a promotes necroptosis has yet to be determined.
Some MT-DNA release may also result from innate immune cell activation. For
example, human neutrophils following activation extrude their MT-DNA due to an
inability to complete mitophagy (Caielli et al., 2016). Additionally, neutrophil extracellular
traps (NETs), which have been found in the lungs of COVID-19 patients (Zuo et al.,
2020), are rich in MT-DNA (Yousefi et al., 2009). Neutrophils have also been identified
as undergoing metabolic reprogramming in the context of SARS-CoV-2 (McElvaney et
al., 2020). In addition to neutrophils, activated platelets also release mitochondria, which
in turn can induce NET generation (Caudrillier et al., 2012), possibly contributing to
pulmonary pro-thrombotic complications observed in patients with severe COVID-19
illness (Middleton et al., 2020). The source and mechanisms of MT-DNA release in
response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is a subject of future investigation.

Multiple clinically established biomarkers such as LDH, Ferritin, CRP and D-dimers are
currently being evaluated to assess the risk of clinical deterioration from a COVID-19
diagnosis (Cummings et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2020; McElvaney et al., 2020; Messner et
al., 2020; Song et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). However, as products of gene expression

in response to both acute and chronic stimuli they tend to be largely non-specific
measures of systemic inflammation with the exception of LDH, a marker of cell death.
Nevertheless, LDH can also be released by cells undergoing apoptosis, a
predominantly anti-inflammatory form of cell death (Kumar et al., 2018). In contrast,
there are accumulating observations that high amounts of MT-DNA release are
specifically generated by necrotic cells (Vringer and Tait, 2019). Additionally, high MTDNA levels have been shown to be associated with acute lung injury, in multiple,
independent cohorts (Faust et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Nakahira et al., 2013).
Here, we observed that MT-DNA levels are approximately 10-fold higher in COVID-19
patients who developed severe pulmonary dysfunction or eventually died suggesting it
is at least as sensitive a biomarker as other clinically established and exploratory
indicators used in prediction models. To conduct plasma MT-DNA measurements we
employed a rapid PCR assay technique that takes about 60 minutes to complete due to
the elimination of the DNA purification step. In resource-limited settings, this can be
especially important given the current necessity to identify subjects at a higher risk of
clinical deterioration. Additionally, PCR-based assays measuring MT-DNA tend to be
less cost prohibitive and do not need specialized equipment, facilitating easy
implementation. Nevertheless, whether MT-DNA levels are equivalent or better
measures than routinely obtained laboratory measurements will require additional
validation with independent cohorts.

Based on our data from this study, it is not possible to clearly determine if circulating
MT-DNA contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease. Nevertheless, cell-free

MT-DNA is itself a signatory marker for the release of other MT DAMPs, which
collectively drive pro-inflammatory cytokine expression through the engagement of
PRRs on innate immune cells (Kulkarni et al., 2020a). MT DAMPs drive IL-6 expression
by macrophages (Maeda and Fadeel, 2014) and stimulate IL-8 release by neutrophils
(Hauser et al., 2010). Notably, IL-6 suppresses lymphopoiesis (Maeda et al., 2005)
while IL-8 promotes neutrophil release from the bone marrow (Terashima et al., 1998)
and therefore, could possibly explain our observed correlation between MT-DNA levels
and elevations in the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio. We additionally noted a significant
correlation between membrane attack complex and MT-DNA levels. Extracellular
mitochondria have been reported to activate complement. Mannan-binding lectin has
been observed to bind to cell free mitochondria resulting in C3 consumption in the
peripheral blood of mice (Brinkmann et al., 2013). Therefore, it is interesting to note that
C3 consumption is a general sign of C3 convertase activity, which would be a
prerequisite for the downstream generation of membrane attack components (Leslie
and Nielsen, 2004). Along those lines, complement activation has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of COVID-19-related end-organ damage, including acute lung injury (Java
et al., 2020; Magro et al., 2020), with potential therapeutic implications (Kulasekararaj et
al., 2020; Smith et al., 2020). Finally, MT DAMPs, unlike other inflammatory markers
linked to poor outcomes of COVID-19 afflicted patients, have been reported to directly
cause acute pulmonary dysfunction and tissue damage (Lee et al.,
2017). Administration of MT DAMPs into the blood stream or pulmonary airways of
rodents promotes acute lung injury mediated by neutrophil chemotaxis and reactive
oxygen species generation to mitochondrial formylated peptides (Hauser et al., 2010;

Scozzi et al., 2019). In these studies, the formylated peptide receptor-1 inhibitor
cyclosporine H was shown to inhibit MT DAMP-mediated acute lung injury. Given
ongoing clinical trials that target the effects of IL-6, complement activation and NETs in
COVID-19 patients (Desilles et al., 2020; Kulkarni et al., 2020b; Maes et al., 2020;
Rilinger et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2020) future approaches that block necroptosis or MT
DAMP recognition could also be warranted.

Our study has several limitations. First, we were unable to concurrently enroll a COVID19 negative group with severe respiratory disease. Our center, as many others
experienced a decline in hospital presentations for illnesses other than COVID-19
during this time making a concurrent, adequately matched control group not possible.
Additionally, as our samples were drawn as a part of a prospective study of subjects
with known SARS-CoV-2 positivity, any other adequately matched control group would
not be entirely comparable, as it was not concurrently drawn. Importantly, we do not aim
to propose that MT-DNA levels are different in those with COVID-19 compared to those
with acute lung injury due to other etiologies. Multiple emerging studies suggest that
biomarkers may be no different in subjects with COVID-19-induced lung injury versus
those due to other etiologies (Sinha et al., 2020b). However, the strength of our study
lies in an assay that can potentially identify subjects presenting with COVID-19 who are
likely to develop adverse outcomes during the course of their hospitalization, which
becomes increasingly important when resources are constrained as has been
unfortunately common during this pandemic (Barrett et al., 2020; Litton et al., 2020;
Moghadas et al., 2020). Second, this study does not assess how MT-DNA correlates

with viral load in COVID-19, which is especially important in the context of deciding
when to intervene with targeted therapeutics (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Du and Yuan,
2020; Maggi et al., 2020). Therefore, further studies will be necessary to evaluate
whether it may be a predictor of response to treatment (Sinha et al., 2020a). Third,
decision-making in the ICU changed over the course of our enrollment. For example,
there was a tendency towards intubating earlier in the course of the critical illness in the
initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we identified MT-DNA as a
predictor of severity utilizing mortality as a primary endpoint, and then ICU admission
and the requirement for intubation as independent, secondary endpoints.
In summary, we demonstrate that MT-DNA measured early in the disease course can
predict survival status, the requirement for intensive level care, and the need for
endotracheal intubation. We also show that MT-DNA levels are associated with
exploratory biomarkers implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related morbidity
and mortality. Further studies will be needed to discern the contribution of MT DAMPs
such as MT-DNA to COVID-19 pathogenesis, as well as to understand whether MTDNA and other inflammatory mediators, such as activated complement, act
synergistically to promote cellular injury.

METHODS

Study Design, Settings and Participants
This prospective cohort study utilized cell-free plasma samples that had been prospectively
collected from 97 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 presenting to the Barnes-Jewish
Hospital from March 15, 2020, to April 24, 2020. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on a
positive nasopharyngeal swab test.

Study Approval
The study was approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Review
Board (ID#202004091 and #202003085). Written informed consent was obtained from all
subjects.

Outcome Definition
Subjects were followed through June 29, 2020. The primary outcome was mortality. The
secondary outcomes included (a) the need for an ICU admission and, (b) endotracheal
intubation. These outcomes were abstracted utilizing an honest broker system from electronic
medical records.

Sample Collection and Processing
MT-DNA and other cytokines were measured in cell-free plasma of subjects within the first 24
hours of emergency department presentation. Blood samples were collected in EDTAcontaining vacutainers (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and subjected to 2 rounds of
centrifugation to generate platelet poor plasma. First at 2,500 x g for 20 mins to generate
plasma. The plasma was removed from vacutainers and centrifuged at 13,000 x g in sterile

nuclease-free eppendorf tubes (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 10 min to remove
platelets. These platelet poor specimens were then immediately stored at −80°C until further
analysis. Concurrently measured clinical markers (I.e., C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate
dehydrogenase, D-dimer) were obtained from the electronic medical record.

MT-DNA quantification

technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA). Copy number was estimated by comparison to a real-time
PCR standard amplification curve generated from known amounts of purified human MT-DNA
and analyzed after a log10 transformation.

Quantification of cytokines and complement activation
Cell-free plasma was analyzed using a Cytokine 35-Plex Human Panel,
which provide simultaneous measurement of 35 cytokines (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA). The assay was performed in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions with each
subject sample performed in duplicate and then analyzed on a Luminex FLEXMAP 3D
instrument. Complement activation was assessed in cell-free plasma specimens (not previously

thawed) using the soluble C5b-9 (sC5b-9) assay (BD OptEIA Human C5b-9 ELISA set, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA).

Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were reported as median (interquartile range). The predictive value of
each biomarker was expressed as area under the curve (AUC) derived from the relative ROC
curve. Spearman r coefficient was calculated to estimate the correlation between two
continuous variables. Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the
unadjusted odds ratios. Independent variables known to have a biological relationship with the
outcomes were selected a priori based on existing literature for the multivariate logistic model to
calculate the adjusted odds ratios (Lederer et al., 2019; Petrilli et al., 2020; Williamson et al.,
2020). Model diagnostics were performed with Corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc),
log-likelihood, and model deviance. All the statistical analyses were calculated, and all figures
were prepared using Graphpad Prism 8.4.2 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). For all the
analyses, a p value <0.05 was considered significant.
