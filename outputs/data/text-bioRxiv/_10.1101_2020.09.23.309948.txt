Abstract
Two cats from different COVID-19-infected households in the UK were found to be
infected with SARS-CoV-2 from humans, demonstrated by immunofluorescence, in
situ hybridisation, reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR and viral genome
sequencing. Lung tissue collected post-mortem from cat 1 displayed pathological and
histological findings consistent with viral pneumonia and tested positive for SARSCoV-2 antigens and RNA. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in an oropharyngeal swab
collected from cat 2 that presented with rhinitis and conjunctivitis. High throughput
sequencing of the virus from cat 2 revealed that the feline viral genome contained five
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to the nearest UK human SARSCoV-2 sequence. An analysis of cat 2’s viral genome together with nine other feline-

derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences from around the world revealed no shared catspecific mutations. These findings indicate that human-to-cat transmission of SARSCoV-2 occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, with the infected cats
developing mild or severe respiratory disease. Given the versatility of the new
coronavirus, it will be important to monitor for human-to-cat, cat-to-cat and cat-tohuman transmission.
Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same species (severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus) as the coronavirus responsible for the 2003 SARS epidemic. It
emerged in December 2020, most likely from a bat reservoir in China, although a role
for an intermediate species cannot be discounted. During the current COVID-19
pandemic, naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 infections linked to transmission from
humans have been reported in domestic cats (1, 2), non-domestic cats (3), dogs (4)
and mink (5). In addition, in vivo experiments have shown that while cats, ferrets and
hamsters are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, ducks, chickens and pigs are
apparently not susceptible (6, 7). Cat-to-cat transmission has been demonstrated
experimentally (6) (8), but the significance of SARS-CoV-2 as a feline pathogen, as
well as its reverse zoonotic potential, remains poorly understood. If SARS-CoV-2 were
to establish new animal reservoirs, this could have implications for future emergence
in humans.
At present, there is no evidence of cat-to-human transmission or that cats, dogs or
other domestic animals play any appreciable role in the epidemiology of human
infections with SARS-CoV-2. However, although the pandemic is currently driven by
human-to-human transmission, it is important to address whether domestic animals
are susceptible to disease or pose any risk to humans, particularly those individuals
who are more vulnerable to severe disease. Domestic animals could also act as a viral
reservoir, allowing continued transmission of the virus, even when Ro < 1 in the human
population. Recent reports from Dutch mink farms of both mink-to-cat and mink-tohuman transmission of the virus provide support for this scenario (5, 9) We used a
range of laboratory techniques to show that two domestic cats from households with
suspected cases of COVID-19, and which displayed either mild or severe respiratory

disease, were infected with SARS-CoV-2. These findings confirm that human-to-cat
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs and can be associated with signs of respiratory
disease in cats.
Materials and Methods
Samples
Sections of lung tissue were collected post-mortem from cat 1, placed in virus transport
medium and stored at -80 °C on 22 April 2020; on 10 June 2020 the virus transport
medium (VTM) was removed, and RNAlater® was added. Lung tissue was also stored
in formalin from 22 April until 8 June, when it was processed to wax prior to
immunohistochemistry.
Infection of cat 2 was identified via a retrospective survey of oropharyngeal and/or
conjunctival swabs collected from 387 cats with respiratory signs that had been
submitted to the University of Glasgow Veterinary Diagnostic Service (VDS) between
March and July 2020 for routine pathogen testing.
Ethics Approval
Ethical approval for this study was granted by the University of Glasgow School of
Veterinary Medicine ethics committee (EA27/20). Permission was given for the
retrospective analysis of feline swabs submitted to VDS for routine respiratory
pathogen testing. Permission was also granted for a public appeal to practising
veterinary surgeons via the Veterinary Record, to solicit the submission of samples
from suspect SARS-CoV-2 cases (10). This appeal was in line with guidance to
veterinarians on the testing of animal samples for SARS-CoV-2 from the Animal and
Plant Health Agency (APHA), issued on 13 May (11). This briefing note confirmed that
testing of animals for the purpose of clinical research was permitted under appropriate
ethical review.
Approval to test tissue samples collected post-mortem from cat 1 in the study was
obtained from the primary veterinary surgeon. On submitting samples to Scotland’s
Rural College (SRUC) Veterinary Services, veterinary practices agree that any sample
may be used to investigate new and emerging diseases.

Respiratory pathogen screening
Samples were received in VTM and screened for feline herpes virus (FHV), feline
calicivirus (FCV) and Chlamydia felis (C. felis).
DNA extracts from VTM samples were tested for the presence of FHV and C. felis
using a multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) approach. The assay
incorporated published C. felis primers (12) together with primers/probes for FHV and
a feline host control gene which were designed in-house. Standard respiratory virus
isolation was also attempted using proprietary feline embryonic (FEA) cells. The
remnants of these samples were stored at 4°C prior to testing for SARs-CoV-2.
Immunofluorescence staining of tissue samples
Sections of 2-3 µm thickness of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung
and liver tissue were cut with a microtome and mounted on glass slides. After sodiumcitrate pressure cooking, the rabbit anti-nucleocapsid antibody (NovusBio, code:
NB100-56683SS, dilution 1:100) and an AlexaFluor-488 secondary antibody
(ThermoFisher, code: A-11034) as well as the ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant with
DAPI (ThermoFisher, code: P36935) were used. For the detection of SARS CoV-2
specific RNA, the RNAscope® 2.5 HD Reagent Kit-RED (code: 322350, Advanced
Cell Diagnostics) and the probe V-nCoV2019-S (code: 848561, Advanced Cell
Diagnostics) were purchased and the protocol was followed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. As positive controls (for immunofluorescence and in situhybridisation), FFPE-Vero cell pellets experimentally infected with SARS CoV-2 were
used and mock infected FFPE-Vero cells served as negative controls.
RNA extraction from respiratory samples and PCR amplification of SARS-CoV2 genome
TRIzol™ Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, Paisley, UK) was added to lyse the
sample and ensure inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, followed by organic solvent extraction
using chloroform;isoamyl alcohol. Subsequent steps were performed using RNeasy®
Mini Kits (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) as per the manufacturer’s instructions, with elution
of the final RNA sample in 55 µl nuclease-free water. One mock RNA extraction was
performed for every seven samples. All samples were tested using two reverse

Primers and probe for the 2019-nCoV_N1 assay were obtained ready-mixed from IDT
(Leuven, Belgium) and used at a final concentration of 500 nM and 127.5 nM,
respectively. Primers and probe for the Orf1ab assay were synthesised by IDT and
used at a final concentration of 800 nM and 400 nM, respectively. PCRs were
performed in a final volume of 20 µl including NEB Luna Universal Probe One-Step
Reaction Mix and Enzyme Mix (both New England Biolabs, Herts, UK) and 5 µl of RNA
sample. Thermal cycling was performed on an Applied Biosystems™ 7500 Fast PCR
instrument running SDS software v2.3 (ThermoFisher Scientific) using the following
conditions: 55 °C for 10 minutes and 95 °C for 1 minute followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C
for 10 s and 58 °C for 1 minute. Four 10-fold dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards,
which were quantified by comparison with plasmids containing the N1 sequences,
were tested in duplicate with each PCR assay. Negative controls included the mock
RNA extractions and at least two no-template controls per 96-well plate.
Sequencing the feline SARS-CoV-2 genome
Following nucleic acid extraction, 5 µl of the extract, corresponding to 81 genome
copies, were utilised to prepare a library, following a protocol developed by the ARTIC
network, adapted for Illumina sequencing. Briefly, the protocol described in
https://www.protocols.io/view/ncov-2019-sequencing-protocol-v2-bdp7i5rn

was

followed, until the amplicon generation stage, utilising the primer version 3. The
resulting DNA amplicons were cleaned using AMPURE beads (Beckman Coulter) and
libraries prepared using a DNA KAPA library kit (Roche) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Indexing was carried out with NEBNext multiplex oligos (NEB), using 7
cycles of PCR. Sequencing was performed in a MiSeq system using a MiSeqV2
cartridge (500 cycles), resulting in 93.57% of reads with Q score > 30. Reads were
quality filtered with TrimGalore (https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore), aligned
to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain (GenBank accession MN908947.3) using BWA

controls processed in parallel retrieved no viral mapped reads after primer trimming.
The created viral genome sequence for cat 2 was uploaded to GISAID with the
accession number EPI_ISL_536400.
The closest UK human SARS-CoV-2 sequence was initially identified using the COGUK cluster identification tool civet (https://github.com/COG-UK/civet). A maximumlikelihood phylogenetic tree of all unique human SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the
same county as cat 2 (n = 324), along with the cat 2 genome, the closest UK human
sequence and the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference, was created using IQ-TREE (15) with the
GTR substitution model (selected by IQ-Tree ModelFinder) and 1000 bootstraps.
Existing feline (n = 9; Belgium, China, France, Spain, USA) and mink (n = 13;
Netherlands) SARS-CoV-2 viral genome sequences were downloaded from the
GISAID website (https://www.gisaid.org) on 31 July 2020.
Results
SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA demonstrated in pneumonic lung tissue
Cat 1 was a four-month-old female Ragdoll kitten from a household in which the owner
developed symptoms that were consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the end of
March 2020, remaining symptomatic until 11 April 2020; the owner was not tested for
SARS-CoV-2. The kitten was presented to its veterinary surgeon on 15 April 2020 with
dyspnoea and physical examination revealed signs of increased respiratory effort,
increased respiratory rate and harsh lung sounds. Radiographic examination revealed
an interstitial and alveolar pattern. The cat’s condition deteriorated, and the animal
was euthanised on 22 April 2020. Post-mortem and subsequent histopathological
examination revealed findings consistent with viral pneumonia. SARS CoV-2 antigen
was demonstrated following immunofluorescent staining of lung sections incubated
with an antibody recognising the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (Figure 1A). Antigen
positive cells were detected in the bronchiolar epithelium, whereas no positive cells
were detected in liver sections from the same cat. To rule out non-specific
immunofluorescent staining, in situ hybridisation was performed, using a probe
targeting the viral spike gene. This demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
in the lung; the positive signal was cell-associated within the alveolar membranes,

suggesting that type I pneumocytes were infected (Figure 1B). In contrast, neither viral
protein nor RNA was detected in the liver.
Identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in retrospective surveillance of feline
respiratory specimens
In order to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in the UK feline
population, a retrospective screening programme was undertaken. A set of 387
oropharyngeal swabs submitted to the University of Glasgow Veterinary Diagnostic
Service for routine testing for respiratory pathogens (FCV, FHV and C. felis) was
selected for analysis. RNA was extracted from each sample and tested for SARSCoV-2 using RT-qPCR. This sample collection coincided with the period when
community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was widespread in the UK (Figure 2). Given
the relatively low seroprevalence in humans (~5%), we estimate that approximately
14 samples in the collection came from cats belonging to COVID-19 affected
households.
Among 387 oropharyngeal swabs tested, the sample from one cat (subsequently
designated as cat 2) tested positive using both the 2019-nCoV-N1 and the Orf1ab
assays. All controls gave the expected results and no other sample run on the same
plate was positive (35 feline samples), ruling out potential laboratory contamination.
The Ct values in the 2019-nCoV-N1 and Orf1ab assays were 34 and 33.5,
respectively, representing a mean copy number of 81 viral genomes per 5 µl of test
sample. Any suggestion that cat 2 had been contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 from the
owner was discounted as serum collected from the cat 8 weeks after the initial
sampling tested seropositive by an independent laboratory (3), confirming productive
infection of cat 2.
The positive surveillance sample from cat 2 had been collected from a six-year-old
female Siamese cat that presented with bilateral yellow ocular discharge as well as a
serous nasal discharge. Conjunctival and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from
cat 2 on 15 May 2020 and sent to the University of Glasgow Veterinary Diagnostic
Service to be tested for respiratory pathogens. The swabs tested positive for FHV DNA

and negative by PCR for C. felis and neither FHV nor FCV was isolated following
attempted virus isolation on FEA cells.
One of the owners had symptoms consistent with COVID-19 when cat 2 was
presented to its veterinary surgeon with clinical signs. The cat tested positive for FHV
DNA as well as SARS-CoV-2 RNA; the cat’s clinical signs were consistent with FHV
infection and therefore the SARS-CoV-2 infection might not have been related to the
clinical signs that the cat displayed at the time of sampling. However, it is also possible
that co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 caused reactivation of FHV in this cat.
Comparison of feline and human SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences
To characterise cat 2’s viral genome, we performed high-throughput sequencing on
RNA derived from the clinical specimen. The generated viral genome sequence was
97.2% complete and contained 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) when
compared with the original Wuhan_Hu-1 reference sequence. Sequence data from
the symptomatic owner were not available and therefore we compared the feline
genome with human SARS-CoV-2 sequences, using data from the COVID-19
Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium. The mutational hamming distance (ignoring Ns
and ambiguities) between the cat 2 viral genome and all COG-UK human viral
genomes available on 23 August 2020 revealed that the closest human SARS-CoV-2
sequences from the UK differed from the feline sequence by five SNPs (n = 141; Table
1); these human sequences were distributed throughout the UK but predominantly
(88%) (16) assigned to one lineage. The closest sequences (n = 11) from the same
county as cat 2 were an additional SNP away. Phylogenetic analyses of these
sequences reinforced the close relationship between the cat 2 viral genome and
human-derived UK SARS-CoV-2 genomes (Figure 3). As we do not have the owner’s
virus sequence, we cannot determine whether the observed mutations in cat 2’s viral
genome arose in a human prior to transmission.
Table 1 details the SNPs observed in the cat 2 viral genome, and their frequency in
the existing UK human population and among existing feline SARS-CoV-2 sequences.
Six of the 13 SNPs are widespread (>50%) in the UK human population and only three
have not been observed previously. It is most likely that the three novel SNPs arose
recently as evolutionary bottlenecks during human-to-human transmission and

represent an unsampled cluster of human variants. Given that no other feline or mink
sequences contained these mutations, there is little indication that these correspond
to a host species adaptation of the virus.
Next we examined all globally available feline SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the
GISAID database for evidence of convergent mutations. Each of the six existing
complete feline viral genomes contained 3 SNPs in common with cat 2 resulting in the
D614G mutation in Spike, the P323L mutation in nsp12, and a synonymous mutation
in nsp3. However, as these mutations are widespread in the human population, it is
likely that they evolved in humans and are not associated with feline adaptation. The
existing feline viral sequences were mutation distances of 0 (n = 4), 1 (n = 1), and 3
(n = 1) SNPs away from the closest human SARS-CoV-2 sequence in their respective
countries. It has been suggested that the D614G mutation in spike (shared by the
feline SARS-CoV-2 genomes) confers a fitness advantage to the virus in humans (17,
18), whether the same mutation renders the virus more infectious for cats remains to
be established.
Discussion
This is the first report of human-to-cat transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in cats in the UK.
Although the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is driven by human-to-human
transmission, concerns have been raised that other species might have the potential
to play a role by becoming a new reservoir for the virus (19). Previously there have
been sporadic reports of human-to-pet transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (1, 2) (4, 20) as
well as human-to-wild felid (3) and human-to-mink transmission (5). It is likely that
such reports underestimate the true frequency of human-to-animal transmission since
animal testing is limited and would be unlikely to detect subclinical infections. Reverse
zoonotic transmission represents a relatively low risk to animal or public health in
areas where human-to-human transmission remains high. Nevertheless, as humanto-human transmission eventually wanes, prospects for transmission among animals
become increasingly important as a source for re-introductions to humans. It is
therefore important to improve our understanding of whether exposed animals could
play a role in transmission. An analysis of the feline SARS-CoV-2 genome from cat 2
demonstrated a high degree of sequence conservation with genomes derived from

infected humans. We examined all of the reported feline SARS-CoV-2 sequence data
and found no evidence of adaptation in the feline sequences. It is likely that all of the
mutations in cat 2’s viral genome were also present in the owner’s virus, but the
genome sequence of the owner’s virus was not available for comparison. Whether
SARS-CoV-2-infected cats could naturally transmit the virus to other animals, or back
to humans, remains unknown. Given the limited genetic variation observed to date
amongst SARS-CoV-2 genomes from animals and humans and the evidence shown
here that naturally infected cats shed virus (or at least moderate concentrations of viral
RNA), it is highly likely that cat-derived viruses could be transmitted to humans and to
other animals. Recent outbreaks in Dutch mink farms provided further evidence of
animal-to-animal transmission and mink-to-human transmission has also been
reported (5); further studies are urgently required to determine the efficiency of animalto-human transmission. It will be important to investigate whether cat-to-human
transmission is possible or likely, and to determine the duration of virus shedding and
the level of contact with humans that is required for transmission to occur.
Cat 1 was euthanised because of the intractable progression of the dyspnoea in the
kitten, whereas the milder clinical signs in cat 2 subsequently resolved. Cat 2 tested
positive for FHV and SARS-CoV-2 and it is possible that coinfection with SARS-CoV2 had led to reactivation of FHV in cat 2. Although no FHV was isolated from
oropharyngeal and conjunctival swabs, FHV was detected by PCR, which is a more
sensitive technique that, in contrast to virus isolation, is unaffected by sample
degradation during transit. A second cat lived in the same household as cat 2, but
neither SARS-CoV-2 RNA nor SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses were
detected in the second cat (3), indicating that the virus was not transmitted between
these two animals that were living in the same household at the time of sampling.
However, experimental transmission studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 replicates
efficiently in cats, causes severe disease in juvenile cats, and can be transmitted from
infected to sentinel cats via droplets (6, 8). The establishment of cat-to-cat
transmission cycles could conceivably be suppressed or facilitated by local cat
management practices, including the frequency of indoor/outdoor cats and the
presence of feral cat colonies.

These two cases in the UK confirm previous findings that cats can acquire infection in
households with SARS-CoV-2-infected humans. One owner in the household to which
cat 2 belonged tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, but no-one from the household of cat
1 was tested. However, one person in the latter household had been symptomatic for
approximately two weeks prior to cat 1 becoming dyspnoeic. Our findings highlight the
importance of co-ordinating the testing of humans and animals within affected
households to monitor zoonotic transmission. The retrospective screening of 387
respiratory samples from cats led to the identification of a single cat that tested positive
for SARS-CoV-2. However, it is unknown how many of these samples came from cats
living in COVID-19 affected households and so we cannot estimate the frequency of
human-to-cat transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the narrow window for
detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA decreases the likelihood of detecting zoonotic or reverse
zoonotic virus transmission. Appropriate surveillance studies are needed to determine
the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats and whether future infections of cats
represent spillover events from humans or are caused by sustained cat-to-cat
transmission.
These findings have potential implications for the management of cats owned by
people who develop SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, there is no evidence that
domestic cats have played any role in the epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic,
but a better understanding of how efficiently virus is transmitted from humans to cats
will require cats in COVID-19 households to be monitored. The two cases of reverse
zoonotic infections that are reported here serve to highlight the importance of a coordinated One Health approach between veterinary and public health organisations.

Table 1: Details of the 13 SNPs observed in the cat 2 SARS-CoV-2 genome with
respect to the original Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence, at least eight of which
occurred in humans. Rows highlighted in bold represent the five SNPs not observed
in the closest human sequences in the UK. *Three of the nine available feline
sequences were less than 900 bases in length and therefore feline percentages are
calculated with respect to the sequences that cover each genome position.
