Summary

23

Despite an unprecedented global research effort on SARS-CoV-2, early replication events

24

remain poorly understood. Given the clinical importance of emergent viral variants with

25

increased transmission, there is an urgent need to understand the early stages of viral

26

replication and transcription. We used single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridisation

27

(smFISH) to quantify positive sense RNA genomes with 95% detection efficiency, while

28

simultaneously visualising negative sense genomes, sub-genomic RNAs and viral proteins.

29

Our absolute quantification of viral RNAs and replication factories revealed that SARS-CoV-2

30

genomic RNA is long-lived after entry, suggesting that it avoids degradation by cellular

31

nucleases. Moreover, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 replication is highly variable between

32

cells, with only a small cell population displaying high burden of viral RNA. Unexpectedly, the

33

Alpha variant, first identified in the UK, exhibits significantly slower replication kinetics than the

Introduction

2

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the

3

COVID-19 pandemic. The viral genome consists of a single 30kb positive strand genomic

4

RNA (gRNA) that encodes a plethora of viral proteins (Kim et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021).

5

SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory tract and infection is mediated by Spike protein

6

binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) where the transmembrane protease

7

serine 2 (TMPRSS2) triggers fusion of the viral and cell membranes (Hoffmann et al., 2020;

8

Wan et al., 2020). Following virus entry and capsid trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum,

9

the first step in the replicative life cycle is the translation of the gRNA to form the replicase

10

complex. This complex synthesizes the negative sense genomic strand, enabling the

11

synthesis of additional positive gRNA copies. In addition, a series of shorter sub-genomic

12

(sg)RNAs are synthesised that encode the matrix, spike, nucleocapsid and envelope structural

13

as well as the non-structural proteins (Kim et al., 2020; Sola et al., 2015). The intracellular

14

localisation of these early events were described using electron microscopy (Laue et al., 2021)

15

and by antibody-based imaging of viral double stranded (ds)RNA (Lean et al., 2020). However,

16

this method of detecting dsRNA lacks sensitivity and specificity at early times post infection,

17

as the low abundance of SARS-CoV-2 dsRNA is indistinguishable from host dsRNAs (Dhir et

18

al., 2018). Our current knowledge on these early steps in the SARS-CoV-2 replicative life cycle

19

are poorly understood despite their essential role in the establishment of productive infection.

20
21

Since the initial outbreak in the Wuhan province of China in 2019 several geographically

22

distinct variants of concern (VOC) with altered transmission have arisen (Chen et al., 2020;

23

Lythgoe et al., 2021). Emerging VOC such as the B.1.1.7 strain (recently renamed Alpha), first

24

detected in Kent in the UK, possess a fitness advantage in terms of their ability to transmit

25

compared to the Victoria isolate, an early Wuhan-related strain of SARS-CoV-2 (Caly et al.,

26

2020; Davies et al., 2021; Kidd et al., 2021; Volz et al., 2021). Many of the VOC encode

27

mutations in the Spike protein (Rees-Spear et al., 2021) and, consequently, the effects of

28

these amino acid substitutions on viral entry and immuno-evasion are under intense study

29

(Kissler et al., 2021; Washington et al., 2021). However, some of the mutations map to non-

30

structural proteins, and it is thus plausible that they impact viral replication dynamics.

31

Unfortunately, the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 variants remains poorly understood, as

32

the current techniques for quantifying SARS-CoV-2 genomes and replication rates rely on bulk

33

approaches or have limited sensitivity.

The use of single molecule and single-cell analyses in biology offers unprecedented insights

2

into the behaviour of individual cells and the stochastic nature of gene expression that are

3

often masked by population-based studies (Fraser and Kaern, 2009; Raj and van

4

Oudenaarden, 2009). In virology these approaches have revealed how cells vary in their ability

5

to support viral growth and how stochastic forces can inform our understanding of the infection

6

process (Billman et al., 2017; Boersma et al., 2020; Chou and Lionnet, 2018; Shulla and

7

Randall, 2015; Singer et al., 2021). Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was previously

8

used to detect RNAs in hepatitis C virus and Sindbis infected cells with high sensitivity (Garcia-

9

Moreno et al., 2019; Ramanan et al., 2016; Singer et al., 2021). However, this approach has

10

only been applied to SARS-CoV-2 in a limited capacity (Burke et al., 2021; Rensen et al.,

11

2021) with the majority of studies utilising amplification-based signal detection methods to

12

visualise viral RNA (Best Rocha et al., 2020; Carossino et al., 2020; Guerini-Rocco et al.,

13

2020; Jiao et al., 2020; Kusmartseva et al., 2020; Lean et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). These

14

experiments used either chromogenic histochemical detection using bright field microscopy,

15

or detection of fluorescent dyes, which both lack the sensitivity to detect individual RNA

16

molecules. Consequently, the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication and transcription

17

during the early phase of infection are not well understood and lack quantitative, spatial and

18

temporal information on the genesis of gRNA and sgRNAs. To address this gap, we developed

19

a single molecule (sm)FISH method based on earlier published protocols (Femino et al., 1998;

20

Raj et al., 2008; Singer et al., 2021; Titlow et al., 2018) to visualise SARS-CoV-2 RNAs with

21

high sensitivity and spatial precision, providing a powerful new approach to track infection and

22

to detect and quantify viral replication factories. Our results uncover a previously unrecognised

23

heterogeneity among cells in supporting SARS-CoV-2 replication and a surprisingly slower

24

replication rate of the Alpha B.1.1.7 variant when compared to the Victoria strain.

SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA at single molecule resolution.

28

To explore the spatial and temporal aspects of SARS-CoV-2 replication at single molecule

29

and cell levels we carried out smFISH experiments with fluorescently labelled probes directed

30

against the 30kb viral genomic RNA. 48 short antisense DNA oligonucleotide probes were

31

designed to target the viral ORF1a and labelled with a single fluorescent dye to detect the

32

positive sense gRNA (+gRNA), as described previously (Gaspar et al., 2017) (Figure 1A). The

33

probe set detected single molecules of gRNA within SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells,

34

visible as well-resolved diffraction-limited single spots with a consistent fluorescence intensity

35

and shape (Figure 1B). Treatment of the infected cells with RNase or the viral polymerase

inhibitor remdesivir (RDV) ablated the probe signal, confirming specificity (Figure S1A). To

2

assess the efficiency and specificity of detection of the ORF1a probe set, we divided the

3

probes into two groups of 24 alternating oligonucleotides (“ODD” and “EVEN”) that were

4

labelled with different fluorochromes. Interlacing the probes minimised chromatic aberration

5

between spots detected by the two colours (Figure 1C). Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 gRNA

6

with these probes showed a mean distance of <250nm between the two fluorescent spots,

7

indicating near-perfect colour registration and a lack of chromatic aberration. 95% of the

8

diffraction-limited spots within infected cells were dual labelled, demonstrating efficient

9

detection of single SARS-CoV-2 gRNA molecules (Figure 1C).

10
11

To assess the specificity of the ORF1a probes we aligned them against other coronaviruses

12

and the human transcriptome. Many of the oligonucleotides showed mismatches with SARS-

13

CoV-1, MERS and other coronaviruses along with human RNAs (Figure 1D). We also

14

evaluated their ability to bind HCoV-229E RNA within infected Huh-7 cells. Although the J2

15

antibody, specific for double stranded (ds)RNA, detected dsRNA foci in the HCoV-229E

16

infected cells, no signal was seen with the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a probe set (Figure S1B). Taken

17

together, these results highlight the efficiency and specificity of the ORF1a probe set for

18

detecting single molecules of SARS-CoV-2 gRNA.

19
20

Having established smFISH for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 gRNA we used this technique

21

to assess both the quantity and distribution of gRNA during infection. Cells were inoculated

22

with virus (MOI 1) for 2h and non-internalised virus removed by trypsin digestion, allowing us

23

to synchronise the infection. At 2 hours post infection (hpi), the majority of fluorescent spots

24

correspond to single gRNAs along with a small number of foci harbouring several gRNA copies

25

(Figure 1E), consistent with early RNA replication events. By 8 hpi, we noted an expansion in

26

the number of bright multi-gRNA foci and at 24 hpi there was a further increase in the number

27

of multi-RNA foci that localised to the perinuclear region, consistent with the reported

28

association of viral replication factories with membranous structures derived from the

29

endoplasmic reticulum (V'Kovski et al., 2021) (Figure 1E). Interestingly, individual gRNA

30

molecules were still detected, especially, at the periphery of cells that may correspond to viral

31

particles (Kamel et al., 2021). To assess whether virion-associated RNA is accessible to the

32

probes, we incubated immobilized SARS-CoV-2 particles with the ORF1a probes. We

33

observed a large number of spots in the immobilised virus preparation that was compatible

34

with single RNA molecules (Figure S1C), suggesting the detection of RNA in viral particles. In

abundance and cellular distribution during early replication.

Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genomic and sub-genomic RNAs.

5

SARS-CoV-2 produces both gRNA and subgenomic (sg)RNAs which are both critical to its

6

replicative life cycle. However, quantitation of sgRNAs is challenging due to their sequence

7

overlap with the 3’ end of the gRNA. To estimate the abundance of sgRNAs we designed two

8

additional probe sets labelled with different fluorochromes; an ORF-N set that hybridises to all

9

canonical positive sense viral RNAs, and an ORF-S set that detects only S-sgRNA and gRNA

10

(Figure 2A) (Kim et al., 2020). Therefore, spots showing fluorescence only for ORF-N or ORF-

11

S probe sets will represent sgRNAs, whereas spots positive for both ORF-N or ORF-S and

12

ORF1a will correspond to gRNA molecules. We applied this approach to visualise SARS-CoV-

13

2 RNAs in infected Vero E6 cells (6 hpi) and observed a high abundance of sgRNAs compared

14

with gRNAs (Figure 2B), in agreement with RNA sequencing studies (Alexandersen et al.,

15

2020; Kim et al., 2020). Further analysis revealed that the ORF-N and ORF-S single labelled

16

spots were more uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm than dual labelled gRNA,

17

consistent with their predominant role as mRNAs to direct protein synthesis (Figure 2B).

18

Association of gRNA with nucleocapsid (N) is essential for the assembly of coronavirus

19

particles (Carlson et al., 2020; Dinesh et al., 2020; Iserman et al., 2020). To monitor this

20

process in SARS-CoV-2, we combined smFISH with the ORF1a and ORF-N probe sets and

21

immunofluorescence with an antibody against N. Our findings show that N protein primarily

22

co-localises with gRNA, while displaying a limited overlap with sgRNAs (Figure 2C). These

23

data show the specificity of our probes to discriminate between the viral gRNA and sgRNAs.

24
25

Negative sense gRNA and sgRNAs are the templates for the synthesis of positive sense RNAs

26

and are expected to localise to viral replication factories. However, their detection by RT-qPCR

27

or sequencing is hampered by cDNA library protocols that employ oligo(dT) selection and by

28

primer binding to dsRNA structures (Ramanan et al., 2016; Sethna et al., 1991). To detect

29

negative sense viral RNAs we denatured dsRNA through either formamide, DMSO or sodium

30

hydroxide treatment (Singer et al., 2021; Wilcox et al., 2019). The combination of DMSO with

31

heat treatment resulted in a loss of anti-dsRNA J2 signal, while maintaining cell integrity,

32

suggesting a disruption of dsRNA hybrids (Figure S2A). We designed an smFISH probe set

33

specific for the ORF1b antisense sequence that targets the negative sense gRNA (-gRNA)

34

and resulted in intense diffraction-limited spots in DMSO and heat-treated cells (Figure 2D).

35

The -gRNA spots were detected at a significantly lower level than their +gRNA counterparts,

1

with substantial overlap observed between the two strands at multi-RNA spots, consistent with

2

these foci representing active sites of viral replication. To determine if these multi-RNA foci

3

contain dsRNA, the permeabilised infected cells were treated with RNaseT1 or RNaseIII,

4

which are nucleases specific for single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and dsRNA, respectively

5

(Figure S2B). RNaseT1 digestion diminished the +gRNA probe signal, while RNaseIII

6

treatment abolished the anti-dsRNA J2 signal. A cocktail of RNaseT1 and RNaseIII ablated

7

both +ORF1a probe binding and anti-dsRNA J2 signals, demonstrating that the ORF1a probe

8

set hybridises to both single and duplex RNA under our experimental conditions (Figure S2B).

9

Furthermore, treating cells with DMSO prior to RNaseT1 fully ablated the smFISH signal

10

(Figure S2C), demonstrating that denaturation makes dsRNA accessible for RNaseT1

11

degradation. In summary, our data showing that probe binding to negative strand gRNA

12

requires chemical denaturation, suggesting that this replication intermediate localise within

13

dsRNA structures.

14
15

Anti-dsRNA antibodies underestimate SARS-CoV-2 replication.

16

The establishment of replication factories is a critical phase of the virus life cycle. Previous

17

reports have Identified these viral cellular factories using the J2 dsRNA antibody (Burgess and

18

Mohr, 2015; Cortese et al., 2020; Targett-Adams et al., 2008; Weber et al., 2006). However,

19

this approach depends on high levels of viral dsRNA as cells naturally express endogenous

20

low levels of dsRNA (Dhir et al., 2018; Kimura et al., 2018) (Figure 2E). To evaluate the ability

21

of J2 antibody to quantify SARS-CoV-2 replication sites, we co-stained infected cells at 2 and

22

6 hpi with both J2 and ORF1a smFISH probes. No viral-specific J2 signal was detected at 2

23

hpi and only 10% of infected cells stained positive at 6 hpi, in agreement with previous

24

observations (Cortese et al., 2020; Eymieux et al., 2021) (Figure 2E). In contrast, more than

25

85% of the cells showed diffraction-limited smFISH signals at both time points (Figure 2F).

26

Furthermore, the average J2 signal detected in the SARS-CoV-2 infected cells at both time

27

points was comparable to uninfected cells (Figure 2F). These data clearly show the J2

28

antibody, although broadly used, underestimates the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In

29

contrast, smFISH detected gRNA as early as 2 hpi, with a significant increase in copy number

30

by 6 hpi, highlighting its utility to detect and quantify viral replication factories.

SARS-CoV-2 replication at single molecule resolution.

The efficiency and sensitivity of the smFISH approach to detect single molecules of SARS-

CoV-2 RNA allows us to investigate the dynamics of viral replication in Vero E6 cells during

the first 10h of infection (Figure 3A). At 2 hpi the +ORF1a probe set detected predominantly

single molecules of +gRNA with a median value of ~30 molecules per cell (Figure 3B-C). Of

2

note, gRNA copies/cell at 2hpi were unaffected by RDV treatment, suggesting that these

3

RNAs derive from incoming viral particles (Figure 3C). In contrast, the increase in gRNA

4

copies/cell at 4 and 6 hpi was inhibited by RDV, reflecting active viral replication. The infected

5

cell population showed varying gRNA levels that we classified into three groups; (i) ‘partially

6

resistant’ cells with <102 gRNA copies that showed no increase between 2 and 8 hpi (60% of

7

the population); (ii) ‘permissive’ cells with ~102-105 copies/cell showing a modest increase in

8

gRNA burden over the time of the experiment (~30%) and (iii) ‘super-permissive’ cells with

9

>105 copies/cell showing a dramatic increase in gRNA copies (~10%). RDV treatment delayed

10

the appearance of super-permissive cells until late times post infection (10-24 hpi) (Figure 3C-

11

E). RDV inhibition of viral replication was partial despite using a concentration that exceeded

12

the IC90 as defined using bulk RT-qPCR method (Figure S3A). Analysing the total cellular

13

gRNA content showed the dominant source of vRNA to be the ‘super-permissive’ cells (Figure

14

3D), suggesting that bulk RNA analyses such as RT-qPCR are biased by these ‘super-

15

permissive’ cells. In the presence of RDV the average gRNA copies/cell were stable over time,

16

suggesting that incoming gRNA is long lived.

17
18

Our high-throughput FISH intensity analysis showed that this cellular heterogeneity persists

19

beyond the primary rounds of infection. At 24 hpi 40% of the cells in the population did not

20

reach the super-permissive state but formed a distinct population with approximately 10-fold

21

less gRNA (Figure 3C and E). Of note, the high level of gRNA in super-permissive cells (~107

22

counts/cell) was comparable over the time course of the experiment, suggesting an upper limit

23

of vRNA copies in Vero E6 cells (Figure 3C). A similar distribution of gRNA was observed

24

between 24-48 hpi, although the levels of gRNA started to decline which may reflect cytolytic

25

effects and virus egress (Figure S3B-D). Treating infected cells at 24 hpi with RDV had a

26

modest effect on gRNA levels (Figure S3D) and reduced the cytolytic effects (Figure S3E),

27

consistent with the long-lived nature of +gRNA within infected cells.

28
29

Simultaneous analysis of +ORF1a and +ORF-N revealed similar expression kinetics for

30

sgRNA, with 11 copies/cell of sgRNA detected in 63% of infected cells at 2 hpi (Figure 3C and

31

3F). Since +sgRNA requires -sgRNA template for its production, our results imply that multiple

32

rounds of transcription occur rapidly following virus internalisation that are RDV insensitive.

33

By 6 hpi, most cells contain sgRNA (Figure 3F), with the super-permissive cells supporting

34

high levels of sgRNA transcription.

We examined the vRNA replication dynamics and found the ratio of sgRNA/gRNA ranged from

2

0.5-8 over time (Figure 3G), consistent with a recent report in diagnostic samples

3

(Alexandersen et al., 2020). Notably, the sgRNA/gRNA ratio increased between 2 and 10 hpi,

4

followed by a decline at 24 hpi, indicating a shift in preference to produce gRNA over sgRNA

5

in later stages of infection. A similar trend was observed in RDV-treated cells, with a reduced

6

sgRNA/gRNA peak at 8-10 hpi. We estimated the sgRNA/gRNA ratio for individual cells and

7

found that sgRNA synthesis is favoured in the ‘partially resistant’ and ‘permissive’ cells,

8

whereas the ‘super-permissive’ cells had a reduced ratio of sgRNA/gRNA (Figure 3H). In

9

summary, these results indicate that gRNA synthesis is favoured in the late phase of infection,

10

that may reflect the requirement of gRNA to assemble new viral particles.

11
12

Positive-sense RNA viruses, including coronaviruses, utilise host membranes to generate viral

13

factories, which are sites of active replication and/or virus assembly (Wolff et al., 2020). Our

14

current knowledge on the genesis and dynamics of these factories in SARS-CoV-2 infection

15

is limited. We exploited the spatial resolution of smFISH to study these structures, which we

16

define as spatially extended foci containing at least 4 gRNA molecules. We observed 1-2

17

factories per cell at 2 hpi, which increased to ~30 factories/cell by 10 hpi (Figure 3I). In addition,

18

the average number of gRNA molecules within these factories, although variable, increased

19

over time (Figure 3J). RDV treatment reduced both the number of viral factories per cell and

20

their RNA content. Together these data show the capability of smFISH to localise and quantify

21

active sites of SARS-CoV-2 replication and to measure changes in gRNA and sgRNA at a

22

single cell level over the course of the infection.

23
24

Super-permissive cells are randomly distributed.

25

Our earlier kinetic analysis of infected Vero E6 cells identified a minor population of ‘super-

permissive’ cells containing high gRNA copies at 8 hpi. A random selection of ~300 cells

27

allowed us to further characterise the infected cell population (Figure 4A-B). To extend these

28

observations we examined the vRNAs in two human lung epithelial cell lines, A549-ACE2 and

29

Calu-3, that are widely used to study SARS-CoV-2 infection (Chu et al., 2020; Hoffmann et

30

al., 2020). In agreement with our earlier observations with Vero E6, 3-5% of A549-ACE2 and

31

Calu-3 cells showed a ‘super-permissive’ phenotype (Figure 4C-D). An important question is

32

how these ‘super-permissive’ cells are distributed in the population, as the pattern could

33

highlight potential drivers for susceptibility (Healy et al., 2020). Infection can induce innate

34

signalling that can lead to the expression and secretion of soluble factors such as interferons

35

that induce an anti-viral state in the local cellular environment (Belkowski and Sen, 1987;

Schoggins and Rice, 2011). Regulation can be widespread through paracrine signalling or

2

affect only proximal cells. We considered three scenarios where ‘super-permissive’ cells are:

3

randomly distributed, evenly separated spatially in the population or clustered together. We

4

compared the average nearest neighbour distance between ‘super-permissive’ cells and

5

simulated points that were distributed either randomly, evenly or in clusters (Figure S4A-C).

6

In summary, our results show conclusively that the ‘super-permissive’ infected Vero E6, A549-

7

ACE2 and Calu-3 cells were randomly distributed (Figure 4E-F and S4D-E). We interpret

8

these data as being consistent with an intrinsic property of the cell that defines susceptibility

9

to virus infection. The data also argue against cell-to-cell signalling mechanisms that would

10

either lead to clustering (if increasing susceptibility) or to an even distribution (if inhibiting) of

11

infected cells.

Differential replication kinetics of the Alpha B.1.1.7 and Victoria strains.

14

The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 VOC, which display differential transmission,

15

pathogenesis and infectivity, have changed the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent

16

studies have focused on mutations in the Spike protein and whether these alter particle uptake

17

into cells and resistance to vaccine or naturally acquired antibodies (Collier et al., 2021; Dicken

18

et al., 2021; Planas et al., 2021). The B.1.1.7 VOC, now designated the Alpha variant, is

19

associated with higher transmission (Davies et al., 2021; Galloway et al., 2021; Volz et al.,

20

2021) and has 17 coding changes mapping to both non-structural (ORF1a/b, ORF3a, ORF8)

21

and structural (Spike and N) proteins. Mutations within the non-structural genes could affect

22

virus replication, independent of Spike mediated entry (Figure 5A). We used smFISH to

23

compare the replication kinetics of the B.1.1.7 and Victoria strains. The number of gRNA

24

molecules at 2 hpi was similar for both viruses, reflecting similar cell uptake of viral particles

25

(Figure 5B-D). However, the quantities of intracellular gRNA and sgRNA were lower in B.1.1.7

26

infected cells compared to Victoria at 6 and 8 hpi (Figure 5B). We also noted that while the

27

amount of gRNA per cell was reduced in the B.1.1.7 variant, there were an equal number of

28

ORF1a and ORF-N positive cells (Figure 5E), suggesting that the reduced B.1.1.7 RNA

29

burden is due to a differential replication efficiency rather than infection rate. The B.1.1.7

30

variant also showed a reduced number of replication factories per cell, with each focus

31

containing on average a lower number of gRNA molecules compared to the Victoria strain

32

(Figure 5F-G). The frequency of super-permissive cells was lower for B.1.1.7 at 6 and 8 hpi

33

(Figure 5H and S5A-B) and their distribution was random (Figure S5C). RDV treatment

34

ablated the differences between the viral strains, demonstrating that the observed phenotype

35

is replication-dependent (Figure 5B, E, G).

1

To confirm that our results with the B.1.1.7 variant are not limited to Vero E6 cells, we

2

assessed replication fitness of both variants in A549-ACE2 cells that were recently reported to

3

be immunocompetent (Li et al., 2021). Both Victoria and B.1.1.7 infection resulted in

4

comparable numbers of infected cells and similar gRNA copies/cell at 2 hpi, demonstrating

5

similar cell entry properties (Figure S6A). However, infection with the B.1.1.7 variant led to a

6

reduced gRNA and sgRNA cellular burden at 8 and 24 hpi (Figure 6A-B and S6B-C).

7

Moreover, fewer ‘super-permissive’ cells were detected at these time points (Figure 6C). We

8

interpret these results as showing that the Alpha B.1.1.7 variant has reduced replication

9

kinetics in cells with an active antiviral response.

10
11

We confirmed these observations by sequencing ribo-depleted total RNA libraries of B.1.1.7

12

or Victoria strain infected A549-ACE2 cells at 2, 8 and 24 hpi (Figure 6A & S6D). As expected,

13

the number of reads mapping to SARS-CoV-2 genome increased over time, reflecting active

14

replication and transcription (Figure 6D). Reads mapping to the 3’ end of the genome

15

increased relative to the 5’ end, reflecting the synthesis of sgRNAs (Figure 6D). In agreement

16

with smFISH, we detected similar levels of vRNA at 2 hpi within B.1.1.7 or Victoria infected

17

cells, consistent with similar internalization rates in A549-ACE2 cells (Figure 6E). However,

18

the abundance of vRNAs in the B.1.1.7 infected cells at 8 and 24 hpi was lower than the

19

Victoria strain (Figure 6D-E). Furthermore, the level of B.1.1.7 RNA changed very little

20

between 2 and 8 hpi, and then increased dramatically at 24 hpi. This profile contrasts with

21

Victoria infected cells, that showed a continuous increase in vRNA over time. Together, these

22

results show the Alpha B.1.1.7 variant has delayed replication kinetics.

23
24

Transcriptomic changes in B.1.1.7 and Victoria infected cells.

25

To explore the differences in RNA replication between B.1.1.7 and Victoria strains we

26

assessed the abundance of the different vRNAs. As our RNA-seq analysis was performed

27

with cDNA produced from ribosome-depleted total RNA, we were able to quantify the negative

28

sense viral RNAs that lack poly(A) tail and will be depleted in oligo(dT)-based approaches. In

29

agreement with our smFISH results (Figure 2G), negative sense viral RNAs represented a

30

small fraction of the total vRNA present in the cell (Figure 6F). Small numbers of negative

31

sense vRNA transcripts were already detectable at 2 hpi, supporting our earlier conclusion

32

that viral replication occurs very early, at least in the ~60% of the cell population identified by

33

smFISH (Figure 3C). The level of negative sense vRNAs increased through the time course

34

for the Victoria strain, but in the case of B.1.1.7 we observed a modest reduction between 8

35

and 24 hpi (Figure 6F).

To assess whether B.1.1.7 showed a delayed expression of sgRNAs, we quantified the reads

2

mapping to the junctions derived from RNA-dependent RNA polymerase discontinuous

3

replication (Kim et al., 2020; V'Kovski et al., 2021). In agreement with smFISH data, sgRNAs

4

were detected in low quantities at 2 hpi (Figure 6D and G) and we observed a rise and fall in

5

sgRNA/gRNA count ratio in the Victoria samples between 8-24 hpi (Figure 6G), in agreement

6

with our single cell smFISH measurements (Figure 3G). In B.1.1.7 infected samples the

7

sgRNA/gRNA ratio was significantly reduced at 8 hpi, suggesting a delayed expression of

8

sgRNAs. Interestingly, B.1.1.7 maintained the sgRNA/gRNA ratio of ~ 4.5 until 24 hpi (Figure

9

6G), suggesting an extended window of sgRNA expression. In summary, these transcriptomic

10

data confirm our smFISH analyses and highlight the altered kinetics of sgRNA/gRNA between

11

the Alpha B.1.1.7 and Victoria strains.

Discussion

14

Our spatial quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 replication dynamics at the single molecule and single

15

cell level provides important new insights into the early rate-limiting steps of infection.

16

Typically, analyses of viral replication are carried out using ‘in-bulk’ approaches such as RT-

17

qPCR and conventional RNA-seq. While very informative, these approaches lack spatial

18

information and do not allow single cell analyses. Although single cell RNA-seq analyses can

19

overcome some of these issues (Fiege et al., 2021; Ravindra et al., 2021), their low coverage

20

and lack of information regarding the spatial location of cells remains significant limitations. In

21

this study we show smFISH is a sensitive approach that allows the absolute quantification of

22

SARS-CoV-2 RNAs at single molecule resolution. Our experiments show the detection of

23

individual gRNA molecules within the first 2h of infection that most likely reflect incoming viral

24

particles. However, we also observed small numbers of foci comprising several gRNAs that

25

were sensitive to RDV treatment, demonstrating early replication events. We believe these

26

foci represent ‘replication factories’ as they co-stain with FISH probes specific for negative

27

sense viral RNA and sgRNA.

28
29

These data provide the first evidence that SARS-CoV-2 replication occurs within the first 2h

30

of infection and increases over time. This contrasts to our observations with the J2 anti-dsRNA

31

antibody where viral dependent signals were apparent at 6 hpi (Cortese et al., 2020; Eymieux

32

et al., 2021). We noted that co-staining SARS-CoV-2 infected cells with J2 and ORF1a FISH

33

probe set showed a minimal overlap, suggesting that infection may induce changes in cellular

34

dsRNA. The observation that infection can perturb mitochondrial function provides a possible

35

explanation for these observations (Appelberg et al., 2020; Mullen et al., 2021). Importantly,

1

mitochondrial dsRNAs can engage MDA5-driven antiviral signalling (Dhir et al., 2018), a

2

recently identified key sensor of SARS-CoV-2 (Thorne et al., 2021b; Yin et al., 2021). These

3

findings highlight the utility of smFISH to uncover new aspects of SARS-CoV-2 replication that

4

are worthy of further study.

5
6

We found that SARS-CoV-2 gRNA persisted in the presence of RDV, suggesting a long half-

7

life that may reflect the high secondary structure of the RNA genome that could render it

8

refractory to the action of nucleases (Simmonds et al., 2021). smFISH revealed complex

9

dynamics of gRNA and sgRNA expression that resulted in a rapid expansion of sgRNA

10

(peaking at 8hpi), followed by a shift towards the production of gRNA (24 hpi), results that

11

were confirmed by RNAseq. Since a viral particle is composed of thousands of proteins and

12

a single RNA molecule, we interpret the high synthesis of sgRNAs as aiming to fulfill the high

13

demand for structural proteins in the viral particles. Once the structural proteins are available

14

in sufficient quantities, the late shift towards gRNA synthesis may ensure the presence of

15

sufficient gRNA to generate the viral progeny.

16
17

Our study shows that cells vary in their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, where the

18

majority of cells had low vRNA levels (<102 copies/cell) but a minor population (4-10% for

19

different tissue cell lines) had much higher vRNA (>105 copies/cell) at 10 hpi. In contrast the

20

cellular vRNA copies at 2 hpi were comparable, suggesting that this phenotype is not

21

explained by differences in virus entry. These ‘super-permissive’ cells account for the majority

22

of vRNA within the culture and mask the dominant cell population. Similar results were

23

obtained with Vero E6, Calu-3 and A549-ACE2 suggesting this is a common feature of SARS-

24

CoV-2 infection. As both Calu-3 and A549-ACE2 have intact innate sensing pathways (Cao

25

et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021) unlike Vero cells (Desmyter et al., 1968), this variable susceptibility

26

is unlikely to reflect differential immune activation pathways and is consistent with their random

27

distribution within the culture. Recent scRNA sequencing studies of SARS-CoV-2 infected

28

bronchial cultures identified ciliated cells as the primary target, however only a minority of

29

these cells contained vRNA that may reflect low sequencing depth or variation in susceptibility

30

(Fiege et al., 2021; Ravindra et al., 2021). The human respiratory tract encompasses the nasal

31

passage, large and small airways and bronchioles and our knowledge of the specific cell types

32

and their SARS-CoV-2 RNA burden is limited. Applying smFISH to clinical biopsies and

33

experimentally infected animal samples (Salguero et al., 2021) will allow us to address this

34

important question.

1

Given the current status of the pandemic, there has been a global effort to understand the

2

biology of emergent VOC with high transmission rates and possible resistance to neutralizing

3

antibodies. The majority of studies have focused on mutations mapping to the Spike

4

glycoprotein as they can alter virus attachment, entry and sensitivity to vaccine induced or

5

naturally acquired neutralizing antibodies. However, many of the mutations map to other viral

6

proteins, including components of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex that could

7

impact RNA replication. Our smFISH analysis revealed that the Alpha B.1.1.7 variant shows

8

slower replication kinetics than the Victoria strain, resulting in lower gRNA and sgRNA copies

9

per cell, fewer viral replication factories and a reduced frequency of ‘super-permissive’ cells.

10

This delay in B.1.1.7 replication was observed in Vero and A549-ACE2 cells and confirmed

11

by RNA-seq. A recent study reported a higher infectivity of B.1.1.7 in Calu-3 cells compared

12

to the Victoria strain and increased expression of sgRNA encoding the innate antagonist

13

ORF9b (Thorne et al., 2021a). The different replication rates of the viral strains observed in

14

our studies may reflect the cell types used along with the single cell approach we used to

15

quantify vRNA. However, we noted a sustained increase in the ratio of sgRNA/gRNA in B.1.1.7

16

infected cells, reflecting the variation in sgRNA and gRNA replication rates in these strains.

17
18

Emerging VOC, such as B.1.1.7, have been reported to have a fitness advantage in terms of

19

their ability to transmit compared to the Victoria isolate (Caly et al., 2020; Davies et al., 2021;

20

Kidd et al., 2021; Volz et al., 2021). However, the mechanisms underlying increased

21

transmission are not well understood. A recent longitudinal study of nasopharyngeal swabs

22

showed that the Alpha B.1.1.7 variant was associated with longer infection times and yet

23

showed similar peak viral loads to non-B.1.1.7 variants (Kissler et al., 2021). The authors

24

conclude that this extended duration of virus shedding may contribute to increased

25

transmissibility and is consistent with our data showing reduced replication of B.1.1.7 at the

26

single cell level. Replication fitness will be defined by the relationship of the virus with its host

27

cell, aggressive replication is expected to trigger cellular antiviral sensors. In contrast, lower

28

replication may allow the virus to replicate and persist for longer periods before host antiviral

29

sensors are triggered. Such differences, and their impact on host anti-viral responses, are

30

likely to be of key importance for our understanding of the success of viral variants to spread

31

through the population.

follows: i) DMSO/heat only (left); ii) RNaseT1 then DMSO/heat (centre); or ii) in the reverse

29

order of DMSO/heat and then RNaseT1 (right). Treated cells were hybridised with +ORF1a

30

and -ORF1b probes (see (Figure 2D) for schematics) and stained with J2. RNaseT1 digestion

31

followed by DMSO treatment shows viral dsRNA are resistant to RNaseT1 activity, but DMSO

32

treatment preceding RNaseT1 suggests denatured dsRNA can be targeted by RNaseT1. Full

33

z-projected confocal images are shown. Scale bar = 10 µm.

(A) Experimental design to profile SARS-CoV-2 replication kinetics using smFISH. Vero E6

3

cells were seeded on cover-glass and 24 h later, inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (Victoria strain,

4

MOI = 1) for 2 h. Non-internalised viruses were removed by trypsin digestion and cells fixed

5

at the timepoints shown for hybridisation with +ORF1a and +ORF-N probes. In the remdesivir

(C) Bigfish quantification of +gRNA or +sgRNA RNA counts per cell. sgRNA counts were

11

calculated by subtracting +ORF1a counts from +ORF-N counts per cell. Horizontal line

12

indicates 105 molecules of RNA. 24 hpi samples and the cells harbouring > 107 RNA counts

13

were quantified by extrapolating single-molecule intensity. Quantified cells from all replicates

14

are plotted. (2-8 hpi, n≥3; 10 and 24 hpi, n=2). Number of cells analysed (Untreated/RDV): 2

20

infected wells was obtained by summing gRNA counts in population and the figure shows the

21

relative fraction from each classification. Representative max-projected images of cells in each

22

category are shown. (2-8 hpi, n≥3; 10 and 24 hpi, n=2)

2020) (provided by PHE Porton Down after supply from the Doherty Centre Melbourne,

10

Australia) and B.1.1.7 (Tegally et al., 2020) (20I/501Y.V1.HMPP1) (provided by PHE Porton

11

Down). Viral strains were propagated in Vero-E6 cells as described (Wing et al., 2021). Briefly,

12

naïve Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of

13

0.003 and incubated for 48-72h until visible cytopathic effect was observed. At this point,

14

cultures were harvested, clarified by centrifugation to remove residual cell debris and stored

15

at -80oC. To determine the viral titre, fresh Vero E6 cells were inoculated with serial dilutions

16

of SARS-CoV-2 viral stocks for 2h followed by addition of a semi-solid overlay consisting of

17

1.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (SIGMA). Cells were incubated for 72h and visible plaques

18

enumerated by fixing cells using amido black stain to calculate plaque-forming units (PFU) per

19

ml. Similarly, HCoV-229E (Andrew Davidson lab (Bristol) and Peter Simmmonds lab (Oxford))

20

virus was propagated in Vero E6 cells and TCID50 was performed in Huh-7.5 cells.

21

For smFISH experiments with the SARS-CoV-2 stains, cells were infected at an MOI of 1 for

22

2h followed by extensive washing in PBS. Residual cell surface associated virus was removed

23

by trypsin treatment of the cell monolayer for 2mins followed by neutralisation of the trypsin

24

using serum containing media. Infected cells were then maintained for defined periods up to

25

24h. For the HCoV-229E, cells were infected at an MOI of 1 and were maintained for 24 and

26

48h.

27
28

RT-qPCR. Infected cells were harvested in RLT buffer and RNA extracted using the Qiagen

previously reported (Titlow et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2017) with minor modifications. Briefly,

3

cells were grown on #1.5 round glass coverslips in 24-well plate or in µ-Slides 8 well glass

4

bottom (IBIDI) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Fisher) for 30 min at room

5

temperature. Cells were permeabilised in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room

6

temperature followed by washes in PBS and 2x SSC. Cells were pre-hybridised in pre-warmed

7

(37˚C) wash solution (2x SSC, 10% formamide) twice for 20 min each at 37˚C. Hybridisation

8

was carried out in hybridisation solution (2x SSC, 10% formamide, 10% dextran sulphate)

9

containing 500 nM smFISH probes overnight at 37˚C. For infection timepoints beyond 24 h,

10

smFISH probes were added at 1 µM. After the overnight hybridisation, cells were washed for

11

20 min in pre-warmed wash solution at 37˚C followed by counterstain with DAPI (1 µg/ml),

12

phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (264 nM) and/or CellMask Green (1:1,000,000) diluted

13

in wash solution. Cells were then washed once with wash solution for 20 min at 37˚C and

14

twice with 2x SSC for 10 min each at room temperature. Cells were mounted using

15

Vectashield, IBIDI mounting media or 2x SSC.

16
17

For RNase digestion experiments, RNaseT1 (Thermo Fisher, EN0541, 100 U/ml) or RNaseIII

18

(M0245S, NEB, 20 U/ml) was used to degrade single-stranded RNA and double-stranded

19

RNA, respectively. Permeabilised cells were treated with RNases in PBS supplemented with

20

5 mM MgCl2 and incubated at 37˚C for 1 h and washed three times with PBS.

21
22

In the experiment to detect viral negative strands, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was

23

denatured using DMSO, formamide or NaOH. After the permeabilisation step, cells were

24

rinsed in distilled water and were treated with 50 mM NaOH for 30s at room temperature, 70%

25

formamide at 70˚C for 1 h or 90% DMSO at 70˚C for 1 h. Following the treatments, cells were

26

quickly cooled on ice, washed in ice-cold PBS and subjected to standard smFISH protocol.

27

smFISH probe design and specificity analysis. Candidate smFISH probe sequences were

28

acquired

29

(https://www.biosearchtech.com/stellaris-designer) with following parameters: Organism –

30

Human, Masking level – 5, Oligo length – 20 nt, Minimum spacing length – 3 nt. Appropriate

31

region of the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512.2) reference sequence was used as

32

target sequence. Candidate sequences were BLAST screened against custom human

33

transcriptome and intron database to score number of off-target base-pair matches, then 35

34

– 48 sequences with the least match scores were chosen per probe set. Oligonucleotides

35

were singly labelled with ATTO633, ATTO565, Cy3, or ATTO488 at 3’ ends according to a

Image analysis

5

Cell segmentation and counting. Cell segmentation was performed either manually in

6

ImageJ (National Institute of Health) or automatically with Cellpose (0.6.1) (Stringer et al.,

7

2021) using 2D maximum intensity projected images of phalloidin or CellMask stains. Cellpose

8

parameters for 60x and 100x magnification images were model_type=cyto, diameter=375,

9

flow_threshold=0.9, cellprob_threshold=-3. For 20x stitched images, CellMask channel was

10

deconvolved with constrained iterative module using cellSens (5 iterations, default spinning

11

disk PSF, Olympus), then following Cellpose parameters were used: model_type=cyto,

12

diameter=55, flow_threshold=0, cellprob_threshold=-6. Total number of cells per image was

13

counted using a custom ImageJ macro script or from the Cellpose segmentation output on

14

DAPI channel images (model_type=nuclei, diameter=20, default threshold). Infected cells

15

were counted using ImageJ “3D object counter” or manually.

16
17

Quantification of smFISH images. Single-molecule level quantification of smFISH images

18

were

19

(https://github.com/fish-quant/big-fish). For FISH-quant, ImageJ ROI files were converted to

20

FQ outline file using a custom python script. Then, smFISH channels were Laplacian of

21

Gaussian filtered (sigma = 7, 3 px) and pre-detected using local maximum mode with “allow

22

smaller z region for analysis” option enabled. Pre-detected diffraction limited spots were fitted

23

with 3D Gaussian and thresholded in batch mode based on filtered intensity, amplitude and

24

σz. Thresholds were defined by uninfected “Mock” condition samples. Viral factories were

25

quantified using the TxSite quantification mode of FISH-quant (xy:z = 500:1200 nm crop per

26

factory) with normal-sampled averaged single-molecule image (xy:z = 15:12 px) from batch

27

mode output by integrated intensity in 3D method. Similarly, cells displaying high viral load

28

were quantified by analogously integrating smFISH intensities, subtracting uninfected

29

condition background fluorescence and dividing by the intensity of reference single-molecules.

30

Large smFISH datasets were processed with a custom python pipeline using Bigfish, skimage,

31

and numpy libraries (available in the Github repository). Tif files were converted to a numpy

32

array and individual cells were segmented from the image using the Cellpose library as

33

described above. Images where cells were labelled with the CellMask stain were pre-

34

processed with a median filter, radius = 50. Background signal in the smFISH channel was

35

subtracted with the skimage.white_tophat algorithm (radius = 5, individual z frames were

processed in 2D due to memory constraints, results were indistinguishable from 3D-processed

2

images). Threshold setting for smFISH spot detection was set specifically for each set of

3

images collected in each session. Viral factories were resolved using `decompose_cluster()`

4

function to find a reference single-molecule spot in a less signal-dense region of the image,

5

which was used to simulate fitting of the gaussian modelised reference spot into viral factories

6

until the local signal intensities were matched. Decomposed spots were grouped into clusters

7

with previously reported radii of double-membrane vesicles (DMV) measured by electron

8

microscopy (150nm pre-8hpi and 200nm post-8hpi) (Cortese et al., 2020).

10

Dual colour smFISH spot detection analysis. The same viral RNA target was detected

11

using two smFISH probes labelled with alternating (ODD and EVEN) red and far-red

12

fluorochromes. Resulting images were processed in FISH-quant to obtain 3D coordinates of

13

each spots. Percentage co-localisation analysis was performed with a custom script using an

14

R package “FNN” (1.1.3). Briefly, we calculated 3D distance of nearest neighbour for each

15

spot in the red channel to the closest detected spot in the other channel and repeated the

16

analysis starting from the far-red channel. We then used a value of 300 nm to define co-

17

localised spots corresponding to the same viral RNA molecule. The presented visuals report

18

percentage co-localisations calculated from the red channel to the far-red channel and vice-

19

versa. The analysis was performed per field of view.

20
21

Quantification of fluorescence intensity and signal colocalization. Immunofluorescence

22

images were background subtracted using rolling ball subtraction method (radius = 150 px) in

23

ImageJ. Anti-dsRNA (J2) stain was quantified by integrating fluorescence signal across the z-

24

stacks of cellular region of interest divided by the cell volume to obtain signal density. Signal

25

density was normalised to the average signal density of uninfected “Mock” condition cells.

26

Fluorescence intensity profiles were obtained using ImageJ “plot profile” tool across 3 µm

27

region on 1 µm maximum intensity projected images. To assess colocalisation of N protein

28

with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, ellipsoid mask centred around centroid xyz coordinates of smFISH

29

spots were generated with the size of the point-spread function (xy radius=65 nm, z

30

radius=150 nm) using ImageJ 3D suite. Integrated density of N-protein channel (background

31

subtracted, radius=5px) fluorescence within the ellipsoid mask was measured and compared

32

to the equivalent signal in the uninfected condition.

Simulation of highly permissive cell distribution. Simulations were performed to determine

if Covid19 superinfection follows a random distribution. The general strategy was to test the

complete spatial randomness hypothesis by comparing the average nearest neighbour

2

distance of superinfected cells to an equal number of randomly selected coordinates (Ripley,

3

1979). 2D spatial coordinates of superinfected cells were obtained from the 3D-obect counter

4

(ImageJ) as described above. Cell nuclei were segmented with the DAPI channel and

5

placement of random coordinates was confined to pixels that fell within the DAPI segmentation

6

mask. Nearest neighbour distances were calculated using the KDtree algorithm

7

(Maneewongvatana and Mount, 1999) implemented in python (scipy.spatial.KDTree).

8

Pseudo-random distributions were simulated by randomly placing the first coordinate, then

9

constraining the placement of subsequent coordinates to within a defined number of pixels.

10
11

RNA-sequencing library preparation. RNA from infected cells were extracted as described

12

above. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina Total RNA Prep with Ribo-Zero

13

Plus library kit (Cat# 20040525) according to manufacturer’s guidelines. Briefly, 100ng of total

14

RNA was first depleted of the abundant ribosomal RNA present in the samples by rRNA

15

targeted DNA probe capture followed by enzymatic digestion. Samples were then purified by

16

Beckman Coulter RNAClean XP beads (Cat #A63987). Obtained rRNA-depleted RNA was

17

fragmented, reverse transcribed, converted to dsDNA, end repaired and A-tailed. The A-tailed

18

DNA fragments were ligated to anchors allowing for PCR amplification with Illumina unique

19

dual indexing primers (Cat#20040553). Libraries were pooled in equimolar concentrations and

20

sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500 and NextSeq 550 sequencers using high-output

21

cartridges (Cat# 20024907), generating single 150nt long reads.

RNA-sequencing analysis

24

Genomes. We downloaded the human genome primary assembly and annotation from

25

ENSEMBL (GRCh38.99) and the SARS-CoV-2 RefSeq reference genome from NCBI

26

(NC_045512.2). We combined the human and viral genome and annotation files into one

27

composite genome and annotation file for downstream analyses.

28

Alignment and gene counts. We performed a splice-site aware mapping of the sequencing

29

reads to the combined human and SARS-CoV-2 genome and annotation using STAR aligner

30

(2.7.3a) (Dobin et al. 2013). We also used STAR to assign uniquely mapping reads in strand-

31

specific fashion to the ENSEMBL human gene annotation and the two SARS-CoV-2 strands.

32

Principal Component Analysis. To assess if SARS2 infection is the main driver of

33

differences in the RNA-seq samples, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA).

34

First, we performed library size correction and variance stabilisation with regularized–

logarithm transformation implemented in DESeq2 (1.28.1) (Love et al. 2014). This corrects for

2

the fact that in RNA-seq data, variance grows with the mean and therefore, without suitable

3

correction, only the most highly expressed genes drive the clustering. We then used the 500

4

genes showing the highest variance to perform PCA using the prcomp function implemented

5

in the base R package stats (4.0.2) (R Core Team 2020).

6
7

SARS-CoV-2 sub-genomic RNA expression. To assess relative levels of viral sub-genomic

8

and genomic RNA expression, we tallied the alignments (using GenomicRanges and

9

GenomicAlignments R packages (Lawrence et al., 2013)) mapping to the region unique to the

10

genomic RNA and the shared region and normalised for their respective lengths. Unique

11

contribution of sgRNA region was then estimated by subtracting the contribution of the

12

genomic RNA from the shared region. To avoid spurious mappings, we filtered for skip sites

13

that were present in all three replicates and constituted at least 0.1% of all skipped viral reads.

14
15

Statistics, data wrangling and visualisation. Statistical analyses were performed in R

16

(3.6.3) and RStudio (1.4) environment using an R package “rstatix” (0.7.0). P values were

17

adjusted using the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons. The “tidyverse suite” (1.3.0)

18

was used in R, and “Numpy” and “Pandas” python packages were used in Jupyter notebook

19

for data wrangling. Following R packages were used to create the presented visualisation:

20

“ggplot2” (3.3.2), “ggbeeswarm” (0.6.0), “hrbrthemes” (0.8.0), “scales” (1.1.1), and

21

“patchwork” (1.1.1). Further visual annotations were made in the Affinity Designer (Serif).
