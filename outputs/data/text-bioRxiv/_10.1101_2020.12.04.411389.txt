Abstract

24

The pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, represents a

25

significant and ongoing international health crisis. A key symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection

26

is the onset of fever, with a hyperthermic temperature range of 38 to 41°C. Fever is an

27

evolutionarily conserved host response to microbial infection and inflammation that can

28

influence the outcome of viral pathogenicity and regulation of host innate and adaptive

29

immune responses. However, it remains to be determined what effect elevated temperature

30

has on SARS-CoV-2 tropism and replication. Utilizing a 3D air-liquid interface (ALI) model

31

that closely mimics the natural tissue physiology and cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2

32

infection in the respiratory airway, we identify tissue temperature to play an important role in

33

the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that temperature elevation induces wide-

34

spread transcriptome changes that impact upon the regulation of multiple pathways, including

35

epigenetic regulation and lncRNA expression, without disruption of general cellular

36

transcription or the induction of interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immune defences.

37

Respiratory tissue incubated at temperatures >37°C remained permissive to SARS-CoV-2

38

infection but severely restricted the initiation of viral transcription, leading to significantly

39

reduced levels of intraepithelial viral RNA accumulation and apical shedding of infectious

40

virus. To our knowledge, we present the first evidence that febrile temperatures associated

41

with COVID-19 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our data identify an important role for

42

temperature elevation in the epithelial restriction of SARS-CoV-2 that occurs independently

43

of the induction of canonical IFN-mediated antiviral immune defences and interferon-

44

stimulated gene (ISG) expression.

Introduction

47

The pandemic spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2,

48

SCV2; (1-3)) is an ongoing international health crisis with over 58 million infections and 1.3

49

million reported deaths worldwide to date (WHO, https://covid19.who.int; November 2020).

50

The spectrum of SCV2 related disease (COVID-19; coronavirus disease 2019) is highly

51

variable, ranging from asymptomatic viral shedding to acute respiratory distress syndrome

52

(ARDS), multi-organ failure, and death. Besides coughing, dyspnoea, and fatigue, fever (also

53

known as pyrexia) is one of the most frequent symptoms of SCV2 infection (4-8). Fever is an

54

evolutionarily conserved host response to microbial infection, which can influence the

55

regulation of host innate and adaptive immune responses (9, 10). Unlike hyperthermia or heat

56

stroke, fever represents a controlled shift in body temperature regulation induced by the

57

expression of exogenous (microbial) and endogenous (host) pyrogenic regulatory factors,

58

including PAMPS (pathogen associated molecular patterns) and pro-inflammatory cytokines

59

(e.g. interleukin 6, IL-6) (9, 10). Body temperature naturally varies throughout the day, with

60

age, sex, and ethnic origin being contributing factors to body temperature regulation (9, 10).

61

In healthy middle-aged adults, fever is defined as a temperature range from 38 to 41°C (T

62

~1-4°C above baseline), with low (38 to 39°C), moderate (39.1 to 40°C), high (40.1 to

63

41.1°C), and hyperpyrexia (>41.1°C) febrile temperature ranges (10). Temperature elevation

64

confers protection against a number of respiratory pathogens (9, 11), with antipyretic drug

65

treatment shown to increase the mortality rate of intensive care unit (ICU) patients infected

66

with influenza A virus (IAV) (12-14).

67

With respect to COVID-19, up to 90% of hospitalized patients show symptoms of

68

fever (4-8). The majority of patients display low (44%) to moderate (13 to 34%) grade fever

69

(4, 5). COVID-19 ICU patients also show a ~10% higher prevalence of fever relative to non-

70

ICU patients with milder disease manifestations (6, 15), suggesting fever to play a role during

71

COVID-19 disease progression. In vitro studies have shown that SCV2 replicates more

72

efficiently at lower temperatures associated with the upper respiratory airway (33°C), which

73

correlates with an overall weaker interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immune response

74

relative to core body temperatures observed in the lower respiratory airway (37°C) (16).

75

These data suggest that tissue temperature could be a significant determinant of SCV2

76

tropism and immune regulation. However, it remains to be determined what effect

77

temperature elevation above 37°C has on SCV2 infection. We therefore set out to determine

78

the net effect of elevated temperature on SCV2 infection within respiratory epithelial tissue.

79

Utilizing a three-dimensional (3D) respiratory model that closely mimics the tissue

80

physiology and cellular tropism of SCV2 infection observed in the respiratory airway of

81

COVID-19 patients (16-24), we demonstrate that elevated temperature (≥ 39°C) restricts the

82

replication and propagation of SCV2 in respiratory epithelium independently of the induction

83

of type-I (IFN) and type-III (IFN) IFN-mediated immune defences. We show that

84

respiratory epithelium remains permissive to SCV2 infection at temperatures up to 40°C, but

85

restricts viral transcription leading to significantly reduced levels of viral RNA (vRNA)

86

accumulation and apical shedding of infectious virus. Importantly, we identify temperature to

87

play an important role in the differential regulation of epithelial host responses to SCV2

88

infection, including epigenetic, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and immunity-related

89

pathways. Collectively, our data identify an important role for tissue temperature in the

90

epithelial restriction of SCV2 replication in respiratory tissue independently of the induction

91

of type-I and type-III IFN-mediated antiviral immune defences.

Results

95

Differentiation of primary human bronchial epithelial cells into ciliated respiratory

96

epithelium supports SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. In order to establish a respiratory

97

model suitable for studying the effect of temperature on SCV2 replication, we differentiated

98

primary human bronchiolar epithelial (HBE) cells (isolated from a male Caucasian donor

99

aged 63 years) into pseudostratified respiratory epithelium. Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)

100

and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of respiratory airway cultures demonstrated that

101

these tissues to contain a mixture of epithelial and goblet cells, with significant levels of

102

apical ciliation and expression of ACE2 (Figure 1A), the principal surface receptor for SCV2

103

and major determinant of tissue tropism (25-28). Infection of respiratory airway cultures with

104

SCV2 (strain England 2; 104 PFU/tissue) at 37°C demonstrated that these tissues support

105

SCV2 infection and replication, with intraepithelial and apical vRNA accumulation

106

detectable by in situ hybridization by 96 h post-infection (Figure 1A). Notably, we observed

107

discrete clusters of SCV2 RNA accumulation within the respiratory epithelium, indicative of

108

SCV2 cell-type specific tropism and/or localized patterns of immune restriction (see below;

109

(29, 30)). The overall morphology of the respiratory epithelium remained largely intact, with

110

little to no discernible shedding of the ciliated surface epithelium over the time course of

111

infection (Figure 1A). Measurement of genome copies (RT-qPCR) and infectious virus

112

(TCID50) within apical washes collected over time (24 to 144 h) demonstrated the linear

113

phase of virus shedding to occur between 48 and 96 h, with peak titres at 120 h post-infection

114

(Figure 1B to E).

115

In order to determine which cellular pathways were modulated in response to SCV2

116

infection, we performed RNA-Seq analysis on RNA extracted from mock-treated or SCV2-

117

infected respiratory cultures incubated at 37°C for 72 h, a time point in the linear phase of

118

viral shedding (Figure 1C to E). Out of the 787 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (Figure

120

analysis identified DEG enrichment in immune system and cytokine related pathways to be

121

significantly upregulated in SCV2-infected relative to mocked-treated tissues (Figure 2B, C

122

p<0.0001). Type-I (IFN, IFNB1) and type-III (IFN, IFNL1-3) IFNs, along with a subset of

123

interferon stimulated genes (ISGs; e.g. BST2, ISG15, Mx1, and ZBP1 amongst others), and

124

other pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL6 and IL32) were upregulated (Figure 2D). Indirect

125

immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections demonstrated that induced ISG expression

126

coincided with productively infected areas of the respiratory epithelium (Figure 2E, Mx1),

127

identifying localized areas of immune regulation within infected tissue. Our findings are

128

consistent with previous reports showing that SCV2 infection induces an IFN-mediated

129

antiviral immune response upon infection of epithelial tissue (16, 18-21, 30-32).

130
131

Respiratory airway cultures induce a heat stress response at elevated temperature. We

132

next investigated the influence of temperature on our respiratory epithelium model. Mock

133

treated respiratory cultures were incubated at 37, 39, or 40°C (representative of core body

134

temperature and low to moderate grade febrile temperatures, respectively) for 72 h prior to

135

tissue fixation or RNA extraction and RNA-Seq. H&E staining demonstrated no obvious

136

morphological changes to the respiratory epithelium upon incubation at elevated temperature

137

(Figure 3A), although an increase in epithelium thickness was detected relative to tissues

138

incubated at 37°C (Figure 3B; 39°C p<0.0001, 40°C p<0.0001). RNA-Seq analysis

139

demonstrated no difference in the expression level of ACE2 (Figure 3C; p=0.4001) or a

140

reference set of genes known to be constitutively expressed across a wide range of cell types

141

and tissues (Figure 3D; 24 genes, p=0.9106; (33-35)). These data indicate that cellular

142

transcription remains largely unperturbed at elevated temperatures up to 40°C. Out of the 650

143

DEGs identified (Figure 3E, Supplemental File S2; p<0.05, ≥ 1.5 or ≤ -1.5 log2 FC), pathway

144

analysis identified DEG enrichment in multiple pathways in tissues incubated at 40°C

145

relative to 37°C, including meiotic recombination, DNA methylation, rRNA expression, and

146

collagen metabolism (Figure 3F). DEG enrichment was also observed in cellular pathways

147

relating to heat stress (Figure 3F black arrow, 3G; R-HSA-3371556) and cellular response to

148

external stimuli (Figure 3G; R-HSA-8953897). Analysis of complete gene sets associated

149

with the cellular response to heat stress (Figure 3H, p=0.0013) or cellular response to heat

150

(Figure S1, p=0.0018; GO:0034605) identified that these pathways were upregulated in

151

respiratory tissues incubated at 40°C relative to 37°C (Supplemental File S2). We conclude

152

that our respiratory tissue model induces a heat stress response at elevated temperature

153

without visible damage to the epithelium or induction of IFN-mediated antiviral immune

154

defences.

155
156

Elevated temperature restricts the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory airway

157

cultures. We next examined the effect of temperature on SCV2 replication in our 3D tissue

158

model. Respiratory cultures were incubated at 37, 39, or 40°C for 24 h prior to mock

159

treatment or SCV2 infection and continued incubation at their respective temperatures.

160

Measurement of genome copies and infectious virus within apical washes collected over time

161

(24 to 72 h) demonstrated that extracellular SCV2 titres were significantly decreased at both

162

39 and 40°C relative to 37°C (Figure 4A to D). RT-qPCR analysis of RNA isolated from

163

infected tissues at 72 h post-infection demonstrated significantly lower levels of intracellular

164

vRNA in tissues incubated at 39 or 40°C (Figure 4E; 39°C p=0.0278, 40°C p=0.0033). These

165

data indicate that respiratory tissue remains permissive to SCV2 infection (tissue entry) but

166

refractory to SCV2 replication at elevated temperatures ≥39°C. To our knowledge, these data

167

identify for the first-time a temperature-dependent growth defect in SCV2 replication at

168

elevated temperature (>37°C).

169

In order examine the underlying mechanism(s) of this intracellular restriction, we

170

compared the relative DEG profiles (p<0.05, ≥ 1.5 or ≤ -1.5 log2 FC) from mock-treated or

171

SCV2-infected tissues at 37 or 40°C (Figure 5, S2, S3, Supplemental Files S1 to S4). Distinct

172

patterns of DEG expression were detected between each paired condition analyzed (Figure

173

5A, B; Supplemental File S5), with clusters of gene commonality (Figure 5B, purple lines) or

174

shared gene pathway ontology (Figure 5B, blue lines). We also identified lncRNAs and

175

micro-RNAs (miRNAs) to be differentially expressed between temperature and SCV2

176

infection conditions (Figure S4; Supplemental File S6). Pathway analysis identified DEG

177

enrichment to be highly specific for each paired condition analyzed, with a clear enrichment

178

in immunity related pathways at 37°C relative to all other conditions (Figure 5C). These data

179

indicate that tissue temperature plays an important role in the differential regulation of

180

transcriptional host responses to SCV2 infection of epithelial tissue. To examine the

181

influence of temperature on immune regulation further, we directly compared the

182

transcriptome profiles from SCV2 infected tissues at 37 and 40°C. Out of the 859 DEGs

183

identified (Figure 6A; p<0.05, ≥ 1.5 or ≤ -1.5 log2 FC), pathway analysis identified immune

184

system and cytokine related pathways to be suppressed during SCV2 infection at 40°C

185

relative to 37°C (Figure 6B, C; Supplemental File S7), findings consistent with a failure of

186

SCV2 to induce the expression of type-I (INF IFNB1) or type-III (IFN, IFNL1-3) IFNs at

187

40°C (Figure 6D). Analysis of this subset of differentially expressed immune genes identified

188

a decrease in gene expression during SCV2 infection at 40°C (mean log2 counts per million

189

[CPM] 1.147, SD 3.656) relative to mock treatment at 37°C (mean log2 CPM 1.578, SD

190

3.716; Figure 6C). These data suggest that SCV2 infection of respiratory tissue at 40°C is not

191

sufficient to induce a robust innate immune response, indicating that the observed

192

temperature restriction of SCV2 at elevated temperature occurs independently of IFN-

193

mediated antiviral immune defences.

194

In order to substantiate these findings, we examined the influence of temperature on

195

SCV2 replication in VeroE6 cells, a cell line derived from Chlorocebus Sabaeus (African

196

green monkey) known to be permissive to SCV2 infection but defective in type-I IFN-

197

mediated immune defences (26, 36, 37). SCV2 replication was restricted at 40°C, but not

198

39°C, relative to infection at 37°C with or without elevated temperature pre-incubation

199

(Figure 7A to C). Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant differences in the baseline

200

expression of genes associated with the cellular response to heat pathway (GO:0034605)

201

between respiratory tissue and undifferentiated HBE (p=0.0142) or VeroE6 (p<0.0001) cells

202

(Figure 7D, E), but not a reference set of genes expressed across a wide range of cell types

203

and tissues (Figure 7F, G, Supplemental File S8; (33-35)). We posit that such differences in

204

the constitutive expression of heat stress response genes is likely to influence the relative

205

restriction of SCV2 upon temperature elevation in a cell type, and potentially species-

206

specific, dependent manner. These data support our tissue analysis (Figure 4 to 6), which

207

demonstrates that the temperature-dependent restriction of SCV2 to occur independently of

208

the induction of IFN-mediated antiviral immune defences.

209

We next examined the stage at which SCV2 infection became restricted during

210

infection of respiratory tissue at elevated temperature. RNA-Seq analysis of SCV2 infected

211

tissues at 72 h post-infection demonstrated no significant difference in the total number of

212

mapped reads (human + SCV2) between 37 and 40°C (Figure 8A, p=0.3429). However,

213

analysis of viral reads identified a decrease in the relative abundance of viral transcripts

214

mapping to multiple ORFs upon temperature elevation (Figure 8B to D, p<0.0010). Indirect

215

immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections for SCV2 nucleocapsid (N) expression

216

demonstrated significantly fewer clusters of SCV2 positive cells within infected tissues at

217

40°C relative to 37°C (Figure 8E, F, p=0.0022). We conclude that infection of respiratory

218

tissue at elevated temperature restricts SCV2 replication through a mechanism that inhibits

viral transcription independently of the induction of IFN-mediated antiviral immune defences

220

that have been reported to restrict SCV2 propagation and spread (31, 38).

222

Discussion

223

A defining symptom of COVID-19 is the onset of fever with a febrile temperature range of

224

38 to 41°C (4-8). However, the effect of elevated temperature on SCV2 tissue tropism and

225

replication has remained to be determined. Here we identify a temperature-sensitive

226

phenotype in SCV2 replication in respiratory epithelial tissue that occurs independently of

227

the induction of IFN-mediated innate immune defences known to restrict SCV2 replication

228

(31, 38). The differentiation of pseudostratified respiratory epithelium has proven to be a

229

valuable research tool to investigate the cellular tropism, replication kinetics, and immune

230

regulation of SCV2 infection, as these tissue models mimic many aspects of infection

231

observed in animal models and COVID-19 patients (16-24, 29, 32, 39-42). While the use of

232

such 3D models represents an important advancement over traditional 2D cell culture

233

systems, the absence of circulating immune cells (e.g. macrophages, natural killer cells,

234

dendritic cells, and neutrophils) which modulate fever and pro-inflammatory immune

235

responses to microbial infection is an important limiting factor (9, 10, 43). Thus, we limit our

236

conclusions to the effect of elevated temperature on SCV2 infection and replication within

237

the respiratory epithelium. Additional animal studies are warranted to determine the overall

238

net effect of fever and pro-inflammatory immune responses on body temperature

239

thermoregulation and its corresponding influence on SCV2 tissue tropism and replication in

240

vivo.

241

Consistent with previous reports (16, 18-21, 30-32), SCV2 infection of respiratory

242

epithelium induced a pro-inflammatory immune response (Figure 2; IFN, IFN1-3, and IL-

243

6). While SCV2 has been reported to induce a relatively weak IFN immune signature in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.04.411389; this version posted December 4, 2020. The copyright holder for this

244

comparison to other respiratory viruses (e.g. IAV) (20, 44), we regularly observed localized

245

areas of epithelial infection (Figure 1A, 2E, 8E) that were coincident with elevated levels of

246

ISG expression (Figure 2E, Mx1). Our findings are consistent with reports that have shown

247

similar patterns of localized infection in the respiratory airway of SCV2 infected ferrets and

248

surface epithelium of organoid cultures (29, 30, 32, 45). These data indicate that SCV2

249

induces a localized immune response during the opening phase of productive infection that is

250

likely to restrict the progress of infection through the epithelium (Figure 1A) (30, 31, 38).

251

Thus, differences in the proportion of epithelial infection and/or rate of intraepithelial spread

252

may account for the observed differences in immune signatures between different respiratory

253

pathogens (20, 46) and variance in apical yields of infectious virus at any given time point of

254

analysis (Figure 1B and Figure 4B, D). As we observed localized areas of ISG induction

255

(Figure 2E), our data support a model of epithelial infection where receptor-binding

256

consumption kinetics of secreted IFN may limit cytokine diffusion and the intraepithelial

257

induction of innate immune defences prior to the recruitment of immune cells and IFN

258

secretion (47, 48).

259

We demonstrate that respiratory epithelial cultures induce a significant heat stress

260

response upon temperature elevation without significant loss of tissue integrity, disruption to

261

cellular transcription, diminished levels of ACE2 expression, or DAMP (damage associated

262

molecular pattern) activation of immune defences at temperatures up to 40°C (Figure 3).

263

Importantly, the elevation of temperature alone was not sufficient to inhibit SCV2 entry into

264

respiratory tissue (Figure 4E), but restricted SCV2 replication leading to reduced levels of

265

SCV2 apical shedding (Figure 4A to D). Thus, we identify tissue temperature to play an

266

important role in the epithelial restriction of SCV2 replication. To our knowledge, these data

267

represent the first account of a growth defect in SCV2 replication at febrile temperatures

269

immune activation in respiratory tissue infected at 40°C (Figure 5 and 6), despite these

270

tissues having abundant levels of intracellular vRNA (Figure 4E). We posit that the lack of

271

immune induction observed at 40°C is likely a consequence of diminished levels of SCV2

272

replication, as vRNA replication has previously been shown to play an important role in the

273

production of PAMPs, including dsRNA intermediates, required for PRR detection and the

274

activation of innate immune defences during respiratory virus infection (49-52). We also

275

show the thermal restriction of SCV2 replication to occur in VeroE6 cells, a cell line

276

permissive to SCV2 infection but defective in type-I IFN-mediated antiviral immune

277

defences (26, 36, 37). Thus, we conclude that elevated temperature restricts SCV2 replication

278

independently of the induction of ISG expression. Importantly, however, PRR detection of

279

PAMPs which stimulate the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines

280

(including IL-6) is a pre-requisite requirement for a fever response to microbial challenge in

281

vivo (9, 10). Thus, additional animal studies are warranted to determine if the temperature

282

restriction of SCV2 observed in respiratory cultures can occur independently of IFN-

283

mediated immune defences in vivo. While speculative, we posit that low to moderate grade

284

fever may confer protection to respiratory tissue within SCV2 infected individuals as a

285

component of a homeostatically controlled non-hyperinflammatory immune response to

286

infection.

287

While we identify temperature to play an important role in the regulation of SCV2

288

replication in respiratory epithelia, the precise mechanism(s) of restriction remains to be

289

determined and warrants further investigation. The induction of a heat stress response alone

290

within respiratory tissue may be sufficient to limit SCV2 replication (Figure 2, Figure S3), as

291

the activation and/or induction of stress response proteins has been shown to play both a

292

positive (proviral) and negative (antiviral) role in the replication of many viruses (53-55).

293

Our transcriptomic analysis identified epithelial host responses to be differentially regulated

294

in response to both temperature elevation and SCV2 infection (Figure 5 and 6), with unique

295

profiles of induced gene expression between mock and SCV2 infected tissues at elevated

296

temperature (Figure 5, Figure S2). Thus, SCV2 infection of respiratory epithelia at elevated

297

temperature elicits a distinct host response that may directly contribute to the restriction of

298

SCV2 propagation, for example the induction of mucins (Figure S2, MUC4 and MUC5AC)

299

which have been proposed to limit coronavirus disease progression and IAV replication (56,

300

57). We also identified a significant difference in the differential expression of lncRNAs and

301

miRNAs upon temperature elevation and SCV2 infection that warrants additional

302

investigation (Figure S4), as changes in the relative expression of non-coding RNAs are

303

known to influence the outcome of virus infection independently of IFN-mediated immune

304

defences (58). Thus, multiple gene products and/or pathways may contribute to the sequential

305

or accumulative restriction of SCV2 replication within respiratory tissue at elevated

306

temperature.

307

Importantly, we identify elevated temperature to lead to lower levels of SCV2

308

transcription and vRNA accumulation (Figure 4E, Figure 8D), suggesting that the

309

temperature-dependent block in SCV2 propagation occurs prior to and/or during vRNA

310

replication. We hypothesize that this block in transcription/replication may relate to the

311

inhibition of SCV2 RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) activity or RdRp RNA

312

binding affinity at elevated temperature, as the genomic replication activity of the IAV RdRp

313

polymerase is known to be restricted at elevated temperature (41°C) (59). Notably, IAV cold-

314

adaptation of RdRp activity has been shown to be a host determinant for avian IAV zoonosis,

315

which naturally replicate at higher temperatures (41°C) within the intestinal tracts of birds

316

(60). As circulating clinical strains of SCV2 are susceptible to non-synonymous mutations

317

within RdRp coding sequences (http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/home), detailed molecular

318

studies are warranted to determine if such amino acid substitutions influence the thermal

319

restriction of SCV2 replication. To our knowledge, no temperature sensitive growth defect

320

for coronaviruses has been reported to date, although a temperature-sensitive (ts) coronavirus

321

mutant has been identified for murine hepatitis virus (MHV, tsNC11) (61). The replication

322

defect of tsNC11 was attributed to coding substitutions within the macrodomain and papain-

323

like protease 2 domain of the non-structural protein 3, which displayed a severe growth

324

defect at 40°C in DBT (Delayed Brain Tumor) cells, whereas wild-type MHV replicated to

325

equivalent titres at 40°C to those observed at 37°C (61). Thus, we present the first evidence

326

demonstrating that a circulating clinical strain of coronavirus is sensitive to temperature

327

thermoregulation. As such, heat-adaptation gain of function experiments through serial

328

passage of SCV2 in respiratory cultures incubated at ≥39°C may shed light on whether the

329

temperature restriction of SCV2 observed is related to viral or cellular host factors, although

330

appropriate levels of biosafety (ethical and genetic modification) should be considered prior

331

to such experimentation.

332

In summary, we identify an important role for tissue temperature in the restriction of

333

SCV2 replication in respiratory epithelia that occurs independently of the induction of IFN-

334

mediated antiviral immune defences. We demonstrate tissue temperature to significantly

335

influence the differential regulation of epithelial host responses induced in response to SCV2

336

infection. Future investigation is warranted to determine the precise mechanism(s) of

337

restriction, as this may uncover novel avenues for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of

338

COVID-19.

(ALI) in PneumaCult-ALI medium containing hydrocortisone and heparin supplements

372

(STEMCELL Technologies, 05001) as specified by the manufacturer’s guidelines. Cells were

differentiated for a minimum of 35 days, with media changed every 48 h and twice weekly

374

apical washing in serum-free DMEM after day 20 at ALI. ALI cultures were apically washed

375

twice before infection, 24 h prior to infection and immediately preceding infection. Cultures

376

were inoculated apically with 100 µl of serum-free DMEM containing 104 PFU of SCV2

377

(based on VeroE6 titres) for 120 mins. The inoculum was removed, and the apical surface

378

washed once in serum-free DMEM (0 h time point). Unless stated otherwise, ALI cultures

379

were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2. For temperature inhibition experiments, ALI cultures

380

were pre-incubated at 37, 39, or 40°C for 24 h prior to infection with continued incubation at

381

their respective temperatures. Apical washing for 30 mins in 200 µl of serum-free DMEM

was used to collect infectious virus. Supernatants were divided into two 100 µl aliquots; one

383

for virus quantitation (TCID50) and the other for vRNA extraction in TRIzol (ThermoFisher,

CO2. The inoculum was removed and 1 ml of overlay containing 0.6% Avicel (Avicel

402

microcrystalline cellulose, RC-591) made up in DMEM containing 2% FCS was added to

403

each well. Cells were incubated for three days at 37°C in 5% CO2 prior to fixation in 8%

EDTA antigen-retrieval). SCV2 nucleocapsid protein was detected using a sheep polyclonal

427

anti-SCV2 N protein antibody (University of Dundee, DA114; EDTA antigen-retrieval).

428

Secondary antibodies for detection were rabbit anti-sheep AlexaFluor 555 (abcam, ab150182)

429

and rabbit anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488 (Sigma-Aldrich, SAB4600056). Nuclei were stained

430

with ProLong Gold (Life Technologies, P36941). Images were collected using a Zeiss LSM

431

710 confocal microscope using 40x Plan-Apochromat oil objective lens (numerical aperture

432

ImageScope analysis software (Leica). Epithelial thickness was measured by manually

438

outlining the bottom and top surfaces of each epithelium (excluding cilia) and measuring the

439

vertical point-to-point distance between each surface across the epithelium. One hundred

440

evenly distributed distance measurements were acquired per epithelium per experimental
