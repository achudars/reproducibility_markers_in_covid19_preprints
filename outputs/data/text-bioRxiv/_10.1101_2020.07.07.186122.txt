Abstract:
Coronavirus disease 2019 is a current pandemic health threat especially for elderly patients
with comorbidities. This respiratory disease is caused by a beta coronavirus known as severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The disease can progress into acute respiratory
distress syndrome that can be fatal. Currently, no specific drug or vaccine are available to
combat this pandemic outbreak. Social distancing and lockdown have been enforced in many
places worldwide. The spike protein of coronavirus 2 is essential for viral entry into host target
cells via interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2. This viral protein is considered a
potential target for design and development of a drug or vaccine. Previously, we have reported
several potential epitopes on coronavirus 2 spike protein with high antigenicity, low
allergenicity and good stability against specified proteases. In the current study, we have
constructed and evaluated a peptide vaccine from these potential epitopes by using in silico
approach. This construct is predicted to have a protective immunogenicity, low allergenicity
and good stability with minor structural flaws in model build. The population coverage of the
used T-cells epitopes is believed to be high according to the employed restricted alleles. The
vaccine construct can elicit efficient and long-lasting immune response as appeared through
simulation analysis. This multiepitope-based peptide vaccine may represent a potential
candidate against coronavirus 2. However, further in vitro and in vivo verification are required.

Background:
In December 2019, multiple pneumonia cases of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan,
China [1]. Later on, genomic analysis of samples collected from admitted patients had revealed
that a novel beta-coronavirus was the causative pathogen [2]. This RNA virus was temporarily
known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), but was renamed later as severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3]. The disease caused by this virus is
known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is usually characterized by fever, dry
cough, fatigue and muscles pain. Additionally, dyspnea can be observed in some COVID-19
patients and it may progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [4]. The
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is largely dependent on respiratory droplets generated through
sneezing or coughing [5]. The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 5.1
days with 95% confidence interval of 4.5 to 5.8 days [6]. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was
recognized as a global pandemic threat on March 11, 2020 [7].
SARS-CoV-2 has a genomic sequence similarity of 79% with a previously known coronavirus,
SARS-CoV [8]. Both viruses can invade host alveolar cells through interaction of viral spike
protein with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). However, the binding affinity of
SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 seems to be 10-20 times higher [9]. It is believed that COVID-19
pathogenesis may involve blockade of ACE2 and subsequent imbalance between angiotensin(1-7) and angiotensin II. This suggests that ACE2 may be further involved in COVID-19
pathogenesis beyond viral entry point [10].
Similar to SARS-CoV, no specific treatment is currently available to combat COVID-19.
However, management of ARDS does involve the use of oxygen-based therapy and antibiotics
against possible sepsis [11]. In attempts to fight COVID-19, clinical trials are keep going to
assess the effect of several antiviral agents like Remdesivir [12]. Additionally, computational
modelling attempts have proposed the repurposing of several FDA approved drugs against
SARS-CoV-2 [13,14].
In the same time, no vaccine was ever developed for any coronavirus. However, advanced
techniques had been employed to generate potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates like
mRNA based vaccine, viral vector vaccine and viral subunit vaccine [15]. Recently, immunoinformatics tools had been used to screen SARS-CoV-2 proteins for potential B-cells and Tcells epitopes [16,17]. The prediction of these epitopes had enabled virtual design of peptide
based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 [18].

Previously, we have predicted several potential epitopes within SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
sequence. Of interest was the linear B-cells epitope with sequence ‘GFNCYFPLQSYGF’, this
epitope is believed to be part of spike protein receptor binding protein (RBD) that is involved
in interaction with ACE2 [17,19]. In the current study, we have constructed a peptide-based
vaccine design by combining seven potential epitopes predicted from our previously published
findings [17]. Then, we have evaluated this vaccine design by using several immunoinformatics tools to affirm its stability, safety and efficiency. The aim of this study is to present
a multiepitope-based peptide vaccine design for potential use against SARS-CoV-2.

Methodology:
Setting up a research plane:
A flowchart that summarizes the steps of vaccine construction and evaluation study can be seen
in Figure 1.
Selection of potential epitopes for peptide vaccine build:
We have selected seven potential epitopes for the construction of vaccine candidate. The
sequence of these epitopes can be seen in Table 1, they have high antigenicity, low
allergenicity and good stability against selected proteases as predicted by our previously
published study [17].

Population coverage of selected T-cells epitopes:
Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule are highly polymorphic and expressed at
different frequencies in different populations. A successful peptide-based vaccine should have
multiple epitopes with different human leucocyte antigen (HLA) binding specificities in order
to increase population coverage. We have used population coverage tool, available through the
immune epitope database (IEDB), to predict the response of population in different locations
of the world to the selected six T-cells epitopes. This web-based tool can predict the response
to specific epitope by using MHC binding and/or T-cells restriction data and also HLA
genotypic frequencies [20,21]. We have specified the number of T-cells epitopes to 6 peptides,
then different areas around the world were selected for population coverage screening. Class I
and II combined option was used to account for both MHC class I and MHC class II restricted
T- cells epitopes. For MHC class I epitopes, we have used the following restricted alleles:

DRB1*01:01, DRB1*03:01, DRB1*04:01, DRB1*04:04, DRB1*04:05, DRB1*07:01,
DRB1*09:01, DRB1*11:01, DQB1*02:01 and DQB1*03:01.
Peptide vaccine construction:
After population coverage analysis, these seven epitopes were then merged together in a
sequential manner by using AAY linker. This linker is considered as a cleavage site of
mammalians proteasomes and can increase epitopes presentation by enhancing the formation
of natural epitopes and reducing the formation of junctional epitopes [22]. To enhance
immunogenicity of vaccine design, we have linked a human beta-defensin 2 chain A as an
adjuvant. This adjuvant is considered an antimicrobial peptide with a length of 41 amino acids,
it was linked to the N-terminus of vaccine design by using EAAAK linker [23,24]. The
EAAAK linker has a rigid nature and can connect the adjuvant to the peptide vaccine with
adequate separation and minimal intervention [25].
Prediction of physicochemical properties, immunogenicity and allergenicity of vaccine
design:
We have used ProtParam web-based tool to predict different physical and chemical
characteristics of vaccine construct [26]. To assess immunogenicity, we have employed
VaxiJen v2.0 predictive tool with a threshold value greater than 0.5. VaxiJen v2.0 tool can
predict protective antigens with no need for sequence alignment, it depends mainly on
physicochemical properties of the submitted peptide [27]. Then we have used AllergenFP v.1.0
tool to evaluate allergenicity potential of vaccine sequence [28]. The sequence of peptide
vaccine was submitted for these tools as one letter format.
Secondary and tertiary structures prediction of vaccine design:
The secondary structure of vaccine construct was predicted by using PSIPRED 4.0 tool [29].
While tertiary structure was modelled by using SPARKS-X, this web-based tool can recognize
protein folding through sequence alignment [30]. For these prediction tools, the sequence of
vaccine design was submitted as one letter code. To further improve vaccine tertiary structure,
the generated PDB file was then submitted to Galaxy refine server. This refinement server
applies molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to implement repeated cycles of structural
perturbation with subsequent relaxation [31].

Vaccine structure validation:
The peptide vaccine structure was submitted as PDB file to RAMPAGE server for
Ramachandran plot analysis. This analysis provides a view for protein conformation by plotting
the torsional angles for each residue [32]. Then, the vaccine PDB was assessed by ProSA-web
tool. This validation software can generate an energy plot and calculate a quality score for each
submitted protein. If the calculated score is outside a range specific for native proteins, then
the submitted peptide may have structural flaws [33]. Finally, the distribution pattern of the
different atoms in the peptide vaccine was evaluated by using ERRAT server. This web-based
tool can statistically analyze the non-bonded interactions between various atom types in the
submitted model build [34].
Molecular docking and dynamics simulation study:
The vaccine PDB was then docked into Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) crystal by using PatchDock
web server. This web-based server uses shape complementarity algorithm for protein-protein
docking [35]. We have used only chain A of TLR8 crystal with PDB code 5Z14, water
molecules and other bounded chemicals were removed from the crystal by using UCSF chimera
version 1.13.1 [36,37]. The Toll-like receptor is very important in linking adaptive immunity
with innate immunity. It plays an essential role in initiating host immune response through
upregulation of inflammatory cytokines. TLR8 has the ability to detect viral single-stranded
RNA [38,39]. The generated docking complex with the highest geometric shape
complementarity score was then downloaded as PDB file and visualized by using PyMOL
version 2.3 and DIMPLOT [40,41].
Later, this docking complex was subject to molecular dynamics (MD) analysis by using
YASARA Dynamics version 19.12.14 [42]. During dynamics simulation, the various atoms
and molecules of protein-protein complex are allowed to interact and move. The trajectories of
these atoms and interaction potential energy are determined for a specific period of time [43].
MD analysis was carried out for 10 nanoseconds by using the same protocol applied in our
previously published article [14].
Simulation of immunogenic response to vaccine construct:
The ability of peptide vaccine to activate various components of host immune system was
predicted by using C-ImmSim server. This modelling platform combines the dynamics of
immune system together with genomic information [44]. At first, the vaccine sequence was

submitted in FASTA format with one letter code. Each one-time step during simulation is
equivalent to 8 hours of real time, the simulation steps were adjusted to 1000 in order to allow
immune response modelling for about 333 days. During the simulation, three injections of the
vaccine were applied to generate efficient and long-lasting immune response. Each injection
contains 1000 units of vaccine construct. The time steps for these injections were specified as
1, 84 and 168 which is equivalent in real time to 1, 28 and 56 days respectively. It is
recommended to apply a time frame of at least one month between vaccine priming dose and
subsequent boost dose in order to allow sufficient time for memory cells proliferation and
development [45,46]. We have used other simulation parameters with default values.

Results and discussion:
The selected six T-cells epitopes showed high predicted population coverage according to
MHC restricted alleles. According to Figure 2, the worldwide coverage of these epitopes was
97.68%. The lowest population coverage was reported in Central America with a percentage
of 60.2, while the highest coverage with 99.14% was recorded for Europe area. The population
coverage data in Figure 2 indicates that the selected T-cells epitopes are suitable for
construction of peptide vaccine and can minimize MHC restriction of T-cell responses.

The primary sequence of peptide vaccine was constructed by merging the seven potential
epitopes together by using AAY linker, while the adjuvant human beta-defensin 2 chain A was
linked to the N-terminus of vaccine construct by using the rigid linker EAAAK. The primary
structure of peptide vaccine can be seen in Figure 3 (A) as one letter format. Prediction of
vaccine secondary structure as appeared in Figure 3 (B) revealed that the percentage of βstrand, α-helix and coil are 10, 53 and 37 respectively. The tertiary structure of vaccine design
was modelled by using SPARKS-X server with a Z-score of 5.26, the model was further refined
by using Galaxy refine server with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.496 from initial
build. The refined tertiary structure of peptide vaccine can be seen in Figure 3 (C).

A summary of predicted physicochemical properties, immunogenicity and allergenicity of
vaccine construct can be observed in Table 2. According to this table, the peptide vaccine
seems to have a net positive charge as the number of positively charged residues exceeds the
number of negatively charged ones. Also, the isoelectric point (IP) is reported to be 8.46. An
isoelectric point value greater than 7 indicates that the overall charge of the peptide is positive.
The isoelectric point is defined as the PH value of a solution at which the protein possesses
zero net charge [47]. The calculated instability index (II) of peptide vaccine is 35.39, proteins
with instability index below 40 are considered stable [48]. The peptide vaccine half-life is
anticipated to be 30 hours in mammalian reticulocytes and greater than 10 hours in Escherichia
coli. The peptide vaccine seems to be a probable antigen with antigenicity score of 0.7432 and
it is probably non-allergenic.

The validation results of vaccine refined tertiary structure can be observed in Figure 4. Based
on analysis of Ramachandran plot in Figure 4 (A), 93.2% of residues are in favored position
of torsional angles plot while 4.8% are in allowed region. Only 2.0% of the residues in the

refined model are considered outliers. Then, the Z-score of the refined model was recorded to
be -3.59 by using ProSA-web tool. This quality score is located within the Z-scores range
calculated for native proteins of similar size as can be seen in Figure 4 (B). The model quality
was also assessed, as presented in Figure 4 (C), by plotting predicting energy as a function of
sequence position. The plot for window size of 40 residues is smoother than 10 residues size.
As obvious, our refined model may have some structural flaws as the predicted energy for
window size of 40 residues jumps slightly higher than zero in part of the plot. Finally, the
overall quality score of ERRAT server is reported to be 82.645. This score represents the
percentage of protein sequence with predicted error value that falls below rejection limit. A
plot of error value versus residues number can be seen in Figure 4 (D). All the above structural
validation results predict that the refined construct has a good stability with minor flaws.

Molecular docking analysis of vaccine construct against TLR8 had generated many potential
complexes. An overview for docking result of the first ranked complex can be seen in Figure
5. This vaccine-TLR8 complex has a geometric shape complementarity score of 17544 with
approximate interface area of 2745.70. A cartoon representation for this complex is well
presented in Figure 5 (A). According to analysis of protein-protein interface illustrated in
Figure 5 (B), The peptide vaccine was able to form 5 hydrogen bonds with TLR8 interface
residues. The anticipated length of these bonds is less than 3.5 Angstrom.

Figure 5: (A) A cartoon illustration for first ranked docking complex of peptide vaccine and
TLR8. The peptide vaccine is colored by red and its interacting residues at the interface are
colored by orange. On the other hand, TLR8 is colored by blue and its residues involved in
interface interaction are colored by green. The hydrogen bonds are represented by yellow
dashed lines. (B) A two-dimensional representation for vaccine-TLR8 interface. Hydrogen
bonds are illustrated as green dashed lines while the small multiple lines refer to hydrophobic
interactions between interface residues.

Molecular Dynamics (MD) analysis results for the first ranked docking complex of vaccine
and TLR8 can be seen in Figure 6. Based on total potential energy calculations in Figure 6
(A), the complex looks to be stable with minimal changes in potential energy predicted
throughout simulation period. However, the vaccine construct seems to exhibit a higher

flexibility per residue than TLR8 as noted from root mean square fluctuation (RMSF)
calculations in Figure 6 (B). The residues of peptide vaccine show a higher variation in
position from its simulation time averaged position (reference position). The results of both
molecular docking and dynamics simulation may indicate the preferential binding of vaccine
design to Toll-like receptor 8.

Finally, the results of simulation for host immune response against injected vaccine can be seen
in Figure 7. As predicted by simulation server, we found that three injections of vaccine
construct with a time frame of 4 weeks between each two doses are necessary to produce loglasting and efficient immune response. According to Figure 7 (A), high immunoglobulins titer
was generated after the second and third vaccine injections. The titer of various
immunoglobulins was kept within a significant level during simulation period even after
vaccine level decline. Following vaccine administration, there was a sharp increase in B-cells
population including memory B-cells as seen in Figure 7 (B). Based on Figure 7 (C), The Bcells were active during simulation period with an increase in cells duplication and antigen
presentation following vaccine injections. The level of helper T-cells, including memory
subtype, was significantly high especially after second vaccine injection as presented in Figure
7 (D). As seen in Figure 7 (E), there was an enhancement in macrophages activity and antigen
presentation at vaccine injection time-steps. Lastly, there was a remarkable rise in the level of
interferon gamma (INF-γ), and interleukin-2 (IL-2) as observed in Figure 7 (F). A sharp
elevation in IL-2 level was observed after the second vaccine injection. In summary, these
simulation results indicate that the vaccine construct can elicit efficient and long-lasting
immune response.

Conclusion:
Here, we report a peptide vaccine construct with multiple epitopes against SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein. The vaccine design seems to be efficient, stable and safe as indicated by prediction,
docking and simulation analyses. It may be a potential candidate for further in vitro and in vivo
evaluation.
