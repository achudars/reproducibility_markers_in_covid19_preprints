Abstract
The immune responses underlying the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain unclear. To help understand the pathology of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemics, public data were analyzed and the expression of PDCD1 (encoding PD-1)
and CD274 (encoding PD-L1) in T cells and macrophages were identified to correlate positively
with COVID-19 severity.

Introduction
COVID-19 has led to the global pandemic and infected millions of people worldwide [1]. It’s urgent
to better understand the pathophysiology of the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 [2-4]. The PD1/PD-L1 signaling plays an essential role not only in regulating tumor immune responses but also
in balancing homeostasis and tolerance in virus infection [5], but it’s role in COVID-19 is currently
unclear. Thus, it is necessary to investigate how PD-1/PD-L1 signaling works during COVID-19
progress in order to deal with it.
Single-cell immune profiling was explored in COVID-19 patients using the public data, which is

essential for understanding the potential mechanisms underlying COVID-19 pathogenesis.

Methods
Data Sets and Processing
We downloaded the gene expression matrix from GEO database (GSE145926 and GSE128033).
This dataset contained 63734 cells from four healthy people, three patients with moderate infection
by bilateral pneumonia and seven patients with severe infection. The detailed clinical information
of patients can be obtained in the reference [6]. Single cell clustering and cell annotation was
performed as previously described [6].
Statistical analysis
The Student’s t-test (t.test in R 3.5.1) was used across three experiment designs. *P<0.05,
**P<0.005, ***P ＜ 0.001. Values are presented as mean Standard deviation (SD). Error bars
represented the SD.

Results
Single-cell analysis revealed distinct immune cell subsets
Publicly available data of bronchoalveolar cells from three moderate (M1-M3) and six severe (S1S6) COVID-19 patients, and four healthy controls (HC1-HC4) were collected for analysis (66630
cells, Table S1) [6]. 31 clusters were identified by classical signature genes according to the
reference (Fig. 1) [6]. CD68-Macrophage (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 19, 21, 24, 30)
dominated among these populations, followed by CD3D-T cell (4, 10, 16).
Various expression patterns of PDCD1 and CD274 in different cell subpopulations

Expression of PDCD1 was first analyzed at the patient group level in different cell subpopulations,
and four trends of their expression dynamics were observed (Fig. 2). PDCD1 expression was
gradually elevated in T cell, B cell, myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), and macrophages from HC to
mild cases then to severe patients (Fig. 2A). In the 2nd trend, PDCD1 expression was specifically
increased in plasma cells and epithelial cells in severe patients but not in mild patients (Fig. 2B).
For the 3rd trend, PDCD1 expression was upregulated in mild patients but slightly reduced in severe
patients in NK and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) (Fig. 2C). No expression of PDCD1 was
detected in mast cells and neutrophils in the 4th trend (Fig. 2D).
The CD274 expression in macrophages, mast cells, pDC, and T cells (1st trend) correlated well with
COVID-19 severity (Fig. 3A) and was specifically increased in plasma cells of severe patients (2nd
trend) (Fig. 3B). However, in neutrophil, mDC, B cells and NK cells, the expression of CD274 was
upregulated in patients with mild COVID-19, then decreased in severe patients (Fig. 3C). In contrary
to the 3rd trend, the expression of CD274 was decreased in mild patients but increased in severe
patients (Fig. 3D).
When analyzed at the individual level, expression of PDCD1 and CD274 was also elevated in mild
and severe patients (Fig. 4A, 4B). Overall, PDCD1 expression in T cells, B cells, mDCs, and
macrophages and CD274 expression in macrophages, mast cells, pDC, and T cells correlated well
with COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, PDCD1 and CD274 expression was specifically increased
in epithelial and plasma cells of severe patients.
The expression of STAT1 was increased in patients with mild and severe COVID-19
Inflammatory signaling participates in modulating PD-L1 expression, particularly, STAT1, which
can be activated by IFNγ or interleukin 6 (IL-6), is a crucial regulator for PD-L1 expression [7, 8].

Furthermore, plasma IFNγ level [3] and the IL-6 level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) [6]
were reported to be increased in COVID-19 patients. Consistently, STAT1 was found upregulated in
both mild and severe patients (Fig. 5), suggesting increased CD274 expression might at least partly
resulting from increased STAT1 level in COVID-19 patients.
The landscape of immune checkpoint molecules in COVID-19 patients
To further elucidate the immune checkpoint landscape of COVID-19 patients, expression of
classical inhibitory and stimulatory checkpoint molecules was assessed. For inhibitory checkpoint
molecules (ICMs), expression of CD160, CD244, PDCD1, BTLA, TIGIT, LAG3, KLRG1, and
ADORA2A were increased in mild patients compared to HC and severe patients while expression of
CTLA4, HAVCR2, IDO1, and CD276 were highest in severe patients (Fig. 6A). Regarding
stimulatory checkpoint molecules (SCMs), expression of TNFRSF9, CD28, ICOS, and CD27 was
elevated in mild patients in comparison to HC and severe patients while expression of TNFRSF18
and CD40 were highest in severe patients (Fig. 6B).
When analyzed at the cell subpopulation level, unique expression patterns of ICMs and SCMs were
demonstrated in each cell subpopulation (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). Expression patterns of ICMs were different
between mild and severe patients (Fig. 7). Most categories and the highest intensity of ICMs were
enriched in severe patients, except in T cells and NK cells. The results indicated that the immune
cells might be more exhausted in severe patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy people and
even mild patients. In terms of SCMs, macrophages, mast cells, and pDC of severe patients got
more enriched than that of mild patients and healthy donors (Fig. 8). In T cell population, more
ICMs and SCMs were enriched in patients with mild and severe COVID-19 than that of healthy
donors, but there was no dramatic difference between mild and severe patients themselves (Fig. 7,

Discussion
Since COVID-19 is pandemic and threatening thousands of people’s life, it is urgent and essential
to investigate the molecular mechanism of the immune pathogenesis of the disease. Compared to
healthy controls, PDCD1 expression in T cells, B cells, mDCs, and macrophages (Fig. 2) and CD274
expression in macrophages, mast cells, pDCs, and T cells (Fig. 3) were upregulated in COVID-19
patients, and correlated well with COVID-19 severity. Moreover, expression of PDCD1 and CD274
was specifically increased in plasma cells of severe patients (Fig. 2, 3), which could serve as a
biomarker for prognosing the severity of COVID-19. Many clinical trials for treating COVID-19
are ongoing. Among them, one clinical trial uses PD-1 monoclonal antibody to block PD-1 in
COVID-19 patients (NCT04268537). Based on our results, PDCD1 expression was dramatically
upregulated in T cells and macrophages especially in severe patients (Fig. 2) and its blockade would
further increase the secretion of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, which will enhance the
cytokine release syndrome reported in COVID-19 patients and possibly associated with disease
severity [2, 3], leading to further tissue damage or even more death especially in severe COVID-19
patients [9, 10]. A current study supports that checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy is risky for severe
outcomes in SARS-CoV-2-infected cancer patients, though these patients were treated with immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) before SARS-CoV-2 infection [11].
