Running Title: Epithelial defence against viral immunopathology

20

Abstract

21

Viral pneumonia remains a global health threat requiring novel treatment strategies, as

22

strikingly exemplified in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of 2019-2020. We have reported

23

that mice treated with a combination of inhaled Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2/6 and TLR 9

24

agonists (Pam2-ODN) to stimulate innate immunity are broadly protected against

25

respiratory pathogens, but the mechanisms underlying this protection remain

26

incompletely elucidated. Here, we show in a lethal paramyxovirus model that Pam2-

27

ODN-enhanced survival is associated with robust virus inactivation by reactive oxygen

28

species (ROS), which occurs prior to internalization by lung epithelial cells. However,

29

we also found that mortality in sham-treated mice temporally corresponded with CD8+ T

30

cell-enriched lung inflammation that peaks on days 11-12 after viral challenge, when the

31

viral burden has waned to a scarcely detectable level. Pam2-ODN treatment blocked

32

this injurious inflammation by reducing the viral burden, and alternatively, depleting

33

CD8+ T cells 8 days after viral challenge also decreased mortality. These findings reveal

34

opportunities for targeted immunomodulation to protect susceptible individuals against

35

the morbidity and mortality of respiratory viral infections.

41

Viruses are the most frequent cause of community acquired pneumonia in children and

42

adults, resulting in significant morbidity in vulnerable subjects and exerting a

43

tremendous health care burden (1-5). Seasonal influenza and emergent pandemic

44

viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, inflict particular mortality in susceptible individuals, with

45

clinicians frequently lacking effective interventions to improve patient outcomes (6-9).

46

Moreover, in addition to causing acute disease, respiratory virus infections are often

47

complicated by chronic lung pathologies, such as asthma induction, progression and

48

exacerbation (10-12). Therefore, development of novel therapeutic anti-viral strategies

49

is required to effectively prevent and treat respiratory infections and their associated

50

chronic complications (13, 14).

51
52

While lung epithelial cells are the principal targets of most respiratory viruses (15), there

53

is expanding evidence that lung epithelia themselves are capable of generating anti-

54

microbial responses (12, 16, 17). We hypothesized that lung epithelial cells can be

55

harnessed to control virus replication, thereby enhancing acute survival and reducing

56

chronic complications of virus infections (18-21). Our group has previously described

57

the phenomenon of inducible epithelial resistance wherein the lungs’ mucosal defenses

58

can be broadly stimulated to protect against a wide range of respiratory pathogens,

59

including viruses (18-23). This protection is induced by a single inhalation of a

60

combination treatment consisting of Toll like receptor (TLR) 2/6 and 9 agonists (Pam2-

61

ODN) shortly before or after viral challenge. While no individual leukocyte populations

62

have been identified as critical for Pam2-ODN-induced resistance, lung epithelial cells

63

are essential to the inducible anti-viral response (18). Further, we have shown that

64

Pam2-ODN mediated protection is dependent upon epithelial generation of reactive

65

oxygen species (ROS) but, interestingly, does not require Type I interferons (22, 23).

66

More recently, we have shown prevention of chronic virus-induced asthma in mice

67

treated with Pam2-ODN but we have not clarified the anti-viral mechanisms (24).

68
69

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of Pam2-ODN enhanced mouse survival

70

of pneumonia caused by a paramyxovirus, Sendai virus (SeV). We found that Pam2-

71

ODN treatment not only reduced lung SeV burden but also decreased epithelial cell

72

injury and host immunopathologic leukocyte responses to SeV infections. While CD8+ T

73

cells are known to contribute to anti-viral immunity, it is shown here that CD8+ T cells

74

contribute substantially to mortality, and this effect can be prevented by Pam2-ODN

75

treatment early in the course of infection or CD8+ depletion late in the course. Further,

76

we demonstrate anti-viral mechanisms of inducible epithelial resistance, where virus

77

particles are inactivated in a ROS-dependent manner prior to internalization by their

78

epithelial targets.

and ODN M362 (0.55 µM) as previously described (22, 23). Mice were treated with 10

92

ml of Pam2CSK4 (4 µM) and ODN M362 (1 µM) by nebulization as previously described

93

(22, 23). For in vitro challenges, SeV at multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 1 was used.

Results

128

Enhanced mouse survival of SeV infection by Pam2-ODN treatment

129

Aerosolized Pam2-ODN treatment one day prior to SeV challenge increased mouse

130

survival of SeV challenge (Figure 1A), similar to the protection observed against lethal

131

influenza pneumonia (18, 21, 22). The survival benefit was associated with reduced

132

lung SeV burden, as measured by SeV M gene expression (Figure 1B). Investigating

133

the natural progression of infection revealed that SeV lung burden was maximal on day

134

5 and gradually decreased until falling below the limit of quantification (LOQ) by day 11

135

(Figure 1C). Pam2-ODN pretreatment reduced SeV burden on all assessed days

136

(Figure 1C). Although the lethality of SeV infection was exquisitely dependent on the

137

inoculum size, we strikingly found that peak mortality paradoxically occurred around

138

days 10 to 12 after infection irrespective of inoculum size, despite the fact that SeV is

139

essentially undetectable that long after challenge (Figure 1A, C, and D).

140
141

Pam2-ODN treatment attenuates SeV-induced epithelial injury

142

This temporal dissociation between peak virus burden and peak mortality led to the

143

hypothesis that SeV-induced mortality may not be exclusively driven by excessive virus

144

burden but may also result from untoward SeV-induced host immune response.

145

Therefore, the acute changes in mouse lungs following SeV infection were

146

characterized. We found increases in lung epithelial cleaved caspase 3 (cCasp3), a

147

marker for programmed cell death, on days 7 to 11 after SeV infection (Figure 2A, upper

148

panel). Virus infection-related epithelial cell injury and death is typically associated with

149

proliferative repair mechanisms (29, 30). Staining the infected mouse lung tissue for

150

Ki67 and EdU revealed maximum signals for both markers in the second week after

151

infection (Figure 2B-E, upper panel). These events of lung epithelial cell death and

152

proliferation coincided with the peak of mortality (day 12, Figure 1E). Further,

153

hematoxylin and eosin staining of lung tissues infected with SeV showed profound

154

increases in inflammatory cells from days 7 to 10 with evidence of damaged airway and

155

parenchymal tissue (Figure 2F). However, Pam2-ODN pretreatment of mice reduced

156

epithelial cell injury and proliferation (Figure 2A-E, lower panel). This temporal

157

association of epithelial injury and death after viral clearance supported our hypothesis

158

that mouse mortality caused by SeV infection is due in part to the host immune

159

response to SeV infections.

160
161

Pam2-ODN attenuates SeV-induced lymphocytic lung inflammation.

162

To explore this hypothesis, the host leukocyte response to SeV infection was

163

characterized. Differential Giemsa staining of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells

164

revealed increased neutrophils on days 2 to 5 and increased macrophages on days 5 to

165

8 (Figure 3A, left and middle panel, solid grey line) after SeV challenge. Congruent with

166

our prior studies, inhaled treatment with Pam2-ODN in the absence of infection led to a

167

rapid rise in neutrophils that was resolved within 5 days (Figure 3A, dashed line) (31).

168

The neutrophil response to SeV challenge was modestly increased among mice

169

pretreated with Pam2-ODN (Figure 3A, left panel, solid dark line). Pam2-ODN-treated,

170

SeV-challenged mice showed almost no difference in macrophage number compared to

171

PBS-treated, SeV-challenged mice (Figure 3A, middle panel, solid dark line). A rise in

172

lymphocytes was observed on days 8 to 11 in PBS-treated, SeV-challenged mice

173

(Figure 3A, right panel, solid grey line), temporally corresponding with peak mortality.

174

However, Pam2-ODN treated, SeV-challenged mice displayed significantly reduced

175

lymphocyte numbers at every time point assessed (Figure 3A, right panel, solid dark

176

line). The gating strategy for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry is shown in

177

Supplementary Figure 1. A modest reduction in CD4+ T cells was observed in Pam2-

178

ODN-treated, SeV-challenged mice compared to PBS-treated, SeV-challenged mice

179

(Supplementary Figure 2). We also found the percentage of CD19+ B220+ B cells

180

reduced after SeV infection in comparison to Pam2-ODN treated and uninfected mice

181

(Supplementary Figure 2), as has been seen with other viral models (32, 33). However,

182

the biggest difference between groups was in CD8+ T cells, with Pam2-ODN-treated,

183

SeV-challenged mice displaying a significantly lower number and percentage of CD8+ T

184

cells than PBS treated, SeV-challenged mice (Figure 3B, C). Since the greatest

185

difference after Pam2-ODN treatment was in CD8+ T cell levels and there was a tight

186

correlation between peak mortality and the increase in lung CD8+ T cells on days 8 to

187

11, we investigated the role of CD8+ T cells in SeV-induced mortality.

188
189

Depleting CD8+ T cells after viral clearance enhances survival of SeV infection

190

To understand the apparent contributions of host immunopathology to mouse

191

outcomes, we depleted CD8+ T cells on day 8 -- after virus burden was substantially

192

reduced but before peak mouse mortality (Figures 1 and 4A). Mice depleted of CD8+ T

193

cells displayed significantly enhanced survival of SeV challenge compared to mice with

194

intact CD8+ T cells (Figure 4B). Depletion of CD8+ T cells was confirmed by flow

195

cytometry in disaggregated lung cells 10 days after SeV challenge (Figure 4C,

196

Supplementary Figure 3A). We also assessed lung injury by hematoxylin and eosin

197

staining of lung tissue 10 days after SeV challenge and found increased inflammation

198

and epithelial cell damage in undepleted mice compared to CD8+ T cell-depleted mice

199

(Figure 4D). This supported our hypothesis that CD8+ T cells contribute to fatal SeV-

200

induced immunopathology.

201
202

To assess the role of CD8+ T cells throughout the course of infection, mouse CD8+ T

203

cells were depleted prior to and during SeV challenge (Figure 4A, Supplementary

204

Figure. 3A, B). This depletion resulted in significantly reduced survival of SeV infection

205

(Supplementary Figure 3C), compatible with the known antiviral functions of CD8+ T

206

cells (34-36). However, it is notable that Pam2-ODN treatment still significantly

207

enhanced survival of SeV challenge even in the absence of CD8+ T cells

208

(Supplementary Figure 3C). This finding was congruent with our previous studies

209

showing Pam2-ODN inducible resistance against bacterial pneumonia despite the lack

210

of mature lymphocytes (Rag1-/-) (18).

211
212

Pam2-ODN treatment leads to extracellular inactivation of virus particles

213

As the antiviral protection consistently correlated with reduced viral burden in vivo, and

214

as the reduced virus burden likely contributes to the reduced CD8+ T cell levels, we

215

sought to determine how Pam2-ODN-induced responses cause antiviral effects.

217

cells (MLE-15) and primary mouse tracheal epithelial cells (mTEC), we found that

218

Pam2-ODN treatment reduced SeV burden at every time point measured, reflecting the

219

inducible antiviral capacity of isolated epithelial cells (Supplementary Figure 4). Further,

220

we investigated whether the principal Pam2-ODN effect occurred before (extracellular)

221

or after (intracellular) virus internalization into their epithelial targets. SeV inoculation

222

was carried out at 4º C preventing SeV internalization while allowing SeV attachment to

223

epithelial cells (26-28). Using multiple methods to determine the effect of Pam2-ODN on

224

SeV attachment, we found no differences in attachment (Figure 5A-D). However, even

225

though similar numbers of virus particles were attached to epithelial cells, when these

226

attached virus particles were liberated from the epithelial cell targets, virus particles

227

from Pam2-ODN-treated epithelial cells were less able to subsequently infect other

228

naive epithelial cells (Figure 5E, F). As the number of attached virus particles was the

229

same, this difference in SeV burden in cells that received liberated virus particles from

230

PBS vs Pam2-ODN treated cells indicated that SeV is inactivated prior to epithelial

231

internalization.

235

The anti-influenza response initiated by Pam2-ODN requires epithelial generation of

236

ROS from both NADPH-dependent dual oxidase and mitochondrial sources (22, 23).

237

Extending these findings to the SeV model, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor (GKT 137831)

238

fully abrogated the Pam2-ODN-induced anti-SeV response (Figure 6A). Similarly,

240

TTFA (a complex II inhibitor) obviated the Pam2-ODN-induced anti-SeV response

241

(Figure 6B) (22, 23). Further, it was found that Pam2-ODN induced epithelial generation

242

of ROS were required for inactivation of SeV prior to epithelial entry (Figure 6C).

243

Congruent with these in vitro and ex vivo studies, mice treated with FCCP and TTFA

244

before Pam2-ODN treatment and SeV challenge (Figure 6D) demonstrated reduced

245

survival (Figure 6E), increased SeV burden (Figure 6F), and increased CD8+ T cells on

246

day 10 (Figure 6G).

247
248

Discussion

249

In this study, we demonstrate that therapeutic stimulation of lung epithelial cells

250

enhances mouse survival of acute SeV infections by both reducing the virus burden and

251

attenuating host immunopathology. While our group has demonstrated inducible

252

resistance against multiple respiratory pathogens including viruses (18-23, 31), these

253

studies demonstrate for the first time when in the virus lifecycle the anti-viral effects

254

begin (viz., prior to internalization), and substantiate the role of ROS in protection

255

against SeV.

256
257

While Pam2-ODN treatment provided a significant host survival benefit in SeV infection,

258

we observed this survival benefit occurring after the time when PBS-treated mice had

259

cleared the virus. This observation prompted the hypothesis that host mortality is not the

260

exclusive result of direct viral injury to the lungs, but due at least in part to the host

261

response to the virus infections. We observed enhanced survival of SeV infections in

262

mice depleted of CD8+ T cells 8 days after infection (Figure 4A,B), revealing the

263

importance of balancing the dual functions of CD8+ T cells in anti-viral immunity and in

264

causing fatal immunopathology. Our findings suggest that the surge in CD8+ T cells

265

within the lungs after most virus has been cleared causes physiologic impairment via

266

lung injury and cell death (Figure 4D). These observations demonstrate an advantage of

267

early immune stimulation to enhance viral clearance and late immune suppression to

268

prevent immunopathology and enhance overall outcome of respiratory infections. This is

269

potentially informative in the context of treating pneumonia in immunocompromised

270

patients, and is likely applicable to broader clinical populations, including those suffering

271

lung injury associated with SARS-CoV-2. Based on this reasoning, clinical trials of the

272

use of Pam2-ODN to prevent or treat early COVID-19 have been launched

273

(NCT04313023, NCT04312997), and we suggest that therapeutic targeting of CD8+ T

274

cells later in COVID-19 be considered.

275
276

Previous reports support the concept of counter-balanced immune protection and

277

immunopathology by CD8+ T cells during virus infections (36-41). Some reports have

278

shown that antigen-experienced memory CD8+ T cells enhance respiratory syncytial

279

virus (RSV) clearance, but also mediate severe immunopathology (39, 42). However,

280

our study is the first to demonstrate the survival advantage in paramyxovirus respiratory

281

infection of either stimulating the lungs’ mucosal defenses early in the infection or of

282

suppressing the CD8+ T cells later in the infection. Our findings are also congruent with

283

reports on the role of CD8+ T cells in non-respiratory viral infection models, such as in

284

West Nile virus infection, where CD8+ T cell deficient mice display decreased mortality

285

(40). While findings from that study and others reveal that the harmful effects of CD8+ T

286

cell mediated immunopathology may supersede the benefits of T cell mediated viral

287

clearance, the question arises of what might be the adaptive value of the vigorous late

288

CD8+ T cell response. One possibility is that it might ensure that the infection does not

289

flare again, but that seems implausible since the host has successfully defended itself

290

against the initial infection, and innate immune mechanisms presumably remain intact

291

and are possibly primed (43, 44), in addition to the multiple adaptive immune

292

mechanisms that increasingly come into play. The possibility that the immunopathology

293

simply results from an error on the part of the immune system also seems implausible in

294

view of the substantial rate of host mortality, suggesting there is likely an adaptive value

295

to the response. A third possibility, that the persistence of pockets of low level infection

296

might lead to chronic lung pathology, is supported by a recent study showing that sites

297

of viral RNA remnants following influenza infection are linked to chronic lung disease

298

(45). Thus, a trade-off may exist between the adaptive value of a vigorous CD8+ T cell

299

response to prevent chronic lung disease and the acute mortality it can cause.

300

Manipulating this balance therapeutically will need to account for both the benefits and

301

costs of the response. It is particularly appealing to develop inducible anti-microbial

302

strategies that do not rely on conventional T cell-mediated microbial clearance and are

303

also effective in vulnerable immune deficient populations (18, 22, 25, 46).

304
305

Although the CD8+ T cell depletion studies enhanced our understanding of

306

immunopathology in virus infections, much of the survival benefit against SeV infection

307

was mediated by rapid anti-viral effects induced by Pam2-ODN. This led us to

308

investigate the mechanisms of these inducible anti-viral effects. Given the multiple steps

309

in the virus life cycle, it was not known at what stage Pam2-ODN exerted its anti-viral

310

effect. Exploring this, we found no difference in number of SeV particles attached to the

311

cells between PBS and Pam2-ODN treatment (Figure 5A-D). However, attached virus

312

particles that were liberated from Pam2-ODN treated cells retained less infective

313

capacity when added to naïve epithelial cells, revealing pre-internalization virus

314

inactivation by Pam2-ODN treatment (Figure 5E, F).

315
316

Knowing that Pam2-ODN inducible resistance required ROS production to protect

317

against influenza (22), we studied the role of ROS in Pam2-ODN-mediated reduction in

318

SeV burden. ROS inhibition not only led to attenuation of Pam2-ODN’s anti-viral effect

319

but allowed increased lung CD8+ T cell numbers, implicating Pam2-ODN-induced ROS

320

in preventing both identified mechanisms of mouse mortality in SeV pneumonia (Figure

321

6). ROS inhibition led to loss of Pam2-ODN-inducible in vitro inactivation of SeV prior to

322

epithelial internalization (Figure 6C), demonstrating for the first time that epithelial ROS

323

directly contribute to virus inactivation.

324
325

Production of ROS as a microbicidal mechanism has been widely reported in

326

phagocytic cells (47-49). However, this mechanism has not been extensively studied in

327

non-phagocytic cells (50), where it apparently acts predominantly extracellularly rather

328

than intracellularly as in phagocytes. (Figure 5F, G). These findings of viral inactivation

329

by epithelial ROS production reveal an essential component of inducible epithelial

330

resistance.

331
332

Taken together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into the antiviral responses

333

generated by the lung epithelium and the prevention of host immunopathology that may

334

inform future therapeutics to target immunomodulation as a means to improve the

335

survival of respiratory infections in vulnerable populations.
