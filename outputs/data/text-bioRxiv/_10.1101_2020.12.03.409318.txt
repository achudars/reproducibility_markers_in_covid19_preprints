Abstract
The novel betacoranavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes a form of severe pneumonia disease,
termed COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). Recombinant human antibodies are proven
potent neutralizers of viruses and can block the interaction of viral surface proteins with
their host receptors. To develop neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, antibody gene
libraries from convalescent COVID-19 patients were constructed and recombinant
antibody fragments (scFv) against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of
the viral spike (S) protein were selected by phage display. The selected antibodies were
produced in the scFv-Fc format and 30 showed more than 80% inhibition of spike (S1-S2)
binding to cells expressing ACE2, assessed by flow cytometry screening assay. The
majority of these inhibiting antibodies are derived from the VH3-66 V-gene. The antibody
STE90-C11 showed an IC50 of 0.56 nM in a plaque-based live SARS-CoV-2 neutralization
assay. The crystal structure of STE90-C11 in complex with SARS-CoV-2-RBD was solved
at 2.0 Å resolution showing that the antibody binds at the same region as ACE2 to RBD. In
contrast to other published anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, the binding of STE90-C11 is not
blocked by known RBD mutations, endowing our antibody with higher intrinsic resistance
to those possible escape mutants.

Introduction
Antibody phage display is a widely used in vitro technology to select human antibody
fragments for the development of therapeutic antibodies (Frenzel et al., 2016). Currently,
14 EMA or FDA approved antibodies were generated by antibody phage display (Alfaleh et
al., 2020). Human antibodies can be selected from two kind of antibody gene libraries:
universal libraries and immune libraries. Universal libraries which have a naïve, semisynthetic or synthetic antibody gene repertoire, allow – in theory - the selection of
antibodies against any kind of molecule, while immune libraries derived from immunized
donors typically facilitate the antibody generation against the pathogen that affected the
donors (Bradbury et al., 2011; Frenzel et al., 2017; Kretzschmar and von Rüden, 2002;
Kügler et al., 2018; Kuhn et al., 2016). Immune phage display libraries from convalescent
patients or immunized human donors were used in the past for the successful generation
of antibodies against infectious diseases (Duan et al., 2009; Rahumatullah et al., 2017;
Trott et al., 2014; Wenzel et al., 2020a; Zhang et al., 2003).
The severe pneumonia COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a disease caused by the
novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and was described at the end of 2019 in Wuhan China
(Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). This new human pathogenic coronavirus is closely
related to the bat coronavirus RATG13 indicating an animal-to-human transition (Shang et
al., 2020a). The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human zinc peptidase
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as main receptor for cell entry. The S protein has
two subunits, the N-terminal S1 harbouring the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the
viral membrane-anchored C-terminal S2 subunit, which is required for trimerization and
fusion of the virus and host membrane for viral entry (Shang et al., 2020b; Starr et al.,
2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020) .
Blocking of the RBD-ACE2 interaction by therapeutic antibodies as a strategy to treat

COVID-19 (Zhou and Zhao, 2020) is a promising approach since the successful
generation of neutralizing antibodies against S1 and RBD was demonstrated already for
SARS-CoV and MERS (Coughlin and Prabhakar, 2012; Widjaja et al., 2019; Zhu et al.,
2007). Some of the anti-SARS-CoV antibodies showed also cross-reaction and crossneutralization of SARS-CoV-2 (Huo et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a).
Human antibodies were also selected directly against SARS-CoV-2 using different
approaches including single B-cell cloning or antibody phage display (Bertoglio et al.,
2020; Cao et al., 2020; Hansen et al., 2020; Kreer et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Liu et al.,
2020a, 2020b; Shi et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2020).
In this work, immune phage display libraries from six COVID-19 convalescent patients
were constructed, RBD-binding antibodies were selected resulting in SARS-CoV-2
inhibiting and neutralizing antibodies. The crystal structure of the best neutralizing
candidate STE90-C11 in complex with RBD was elucidated. Together with its unique
binding pattern that tolerates a large number of RBD mutations, its properties suggest its
use as a therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Results
Immune library construction
For the immune library construction, we collected blood samples of 16 q-RT-PCR
confirmed COVID-19 convalescent patients. To analyze the immune answer, sera of all
patients were titrated on RBD (Supplementary Data 1). The patients 1,2,5,6,9 and 14
showed the highest IgG titers against RBD and were chosen for library construction.
PBMCs were isolated and CD19+/CD138+ plasma cells were enriched by FACS from
some of these samples (Supplementary Data 2). Both PBMCs and plasma cells were used
for library construction. Six individual libraries were constructed from PBMCs of patients 2,
6 and 14, while four additional libraries were made from CD19+/CD138+ plasma cells
pools (pool 1: patients 2,6,14; pool 2: patients1,5,9). All libraries were constructed cloning
kappa and lambda antibody genes separately, resulting in diversities ranging from 0.7x10 7
to 1.7x108 estimated independent clones.

Antibody fragments were selected against SARS-CoV-2
Antibodies were selected by panning in microtiter plates against SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit
using S1-S2 in the first panning round, RBD in the second panning round and S1-S2 in the
third panning round. This approach focuses on the antibody selection on epitopes located
within the RBD while being presented in the correct conformation of the intact spike protein
trimer. The two plasma cell-derived immune libraries for kappa, respectively lambda, were
combined and the panning was performed separately for lambda and kappa libraries. All
kappa and lambda libraries originating from the PBMCs were pooled together. The
following single clone screening was performed by antigen ELISA in 96 well MTPs, using
soluble monoclonal scFv produced by E. coli. 542 monoclonal hits were identified. DNA
sequencing revealed 197 unique antibodies. The V-Gene combinations for kappa

(Supplementary Data 3) and lambda (Supplementary Data 4) antibodies were analyzed .
The most abundantly used V-genes were VH3-66, VK1D-39 und VL3-21. Antibody
sequences that showed potential developabilty liabilities, i.e. glycosylation sites or single
cysteines

in the CDRs were excluded from further analysis. 135 antibodies were re-

cloned into the bivalent scFv-Fc format and produced in Expi293F cell in 5 mL culture
scale, with yields ranging from of 70 to 260 mg/L.

Screening for inhibition in a cell-based assay
To screen for SARS-CoV-2 blocking antibodies, an inhibition assay was performed by flow
cytometry on ACE2-expressing EXPI293F cells, measuring direct competition between S1S2 trimer and scFv-Fc antibodies. The entire spike protein ectodomain was used for this
inhibition assay for optimal representation of the viral binding. In a first screening, the 135
antibodies were tested at 1500 nM S1-S2 (molar ratio antibody:S1-S2 30:1) (Figure 1). 30
antibodies that inhibited S1-S2 binding more than 80% were selected for further analysis.
The germlines genes of these inhibiting scFv-Fc are given in Table 1. VH3-66 was the
most abundantly used heavy chain V-gene of the well inhibiting scFv-Fc. All VH3-66
derived antibodies had closely related VH CDRs amino acid sequence while the
corresponding light chains were different.

Antigen binding and cell-based inhibition by IgG
The 30 antibodies were screened in a cytopathic effect (CPE)-based neutralization
screening assay (data not shown) and the best neutralizing 19 scFv-Fc were re-cloned
and produced as human IgG in 50 mL culture scale, with yields ranging from 12 to 93
mg/L. EC50 values of binding to RBD, S1 or S1-S2 were determined (Figure 2) and are
shown in Table 1. Antibodies STE90-C11, STE90-B2-D12, STE94-F6 and STE94-H2

showed EC50 values ranging between 0.2-0.5 nM on all antigens tested. Inhibition of ACE2
binding was assessed at concentrations from 100 nM - 0.3 nM IgG using 10 nM RBD
(Figure 3A) or 500 nM - 1.5 nM IgG using 50 nM S1-S2 spike (Figure 3B) in the previously
described cell-based inhibition assay. The extent of inhibition by STE90-C11 of both RBD
and S1-S2 was further validated in an further cellular assay with ACE2 expressing cells
(Supplementary Data 5). The best antibodies showed IC 50 values of 2.6-15 nM IgG for 50
nM S1-S2 spike, respectively 1-3 nM IgG for 10 nM RBD (Table 1). For 50% inhibition the
best molar ratios were from 0.02-0.3:1 (antibody binding site:antigen).

Antibodies from COVID19 patient libraries neutralize active SARS-CoV-2 virus
To analyze the neutralization capacity of the antibodies, the 19 IgGs were first screened in
a plaque titration assay using active ~15 pfu SARS-CoV-2 virus. The antibody Palivizumab
was used as control antibody (Figure 3C). The antibody STE90-C11 was chosen to be
further analyzed. To confirm its neutralizing activity, a plaque assay using ~150 pfu was
performed and the determined IC50 was 0.56 nM in the IgG format (Figure 3D).

STE90-C11 is specific for SARS-CoV-2 and binds RBD independent of known RBD
mutations
A detailed characterization of the best neutralizer was performed in respect to crossreaction to other coronaviruses, binding to known RBD mutations, as well as biochemical
and biophysical properties. The binding of STE90-C11 to other coronaviruses SARS-CoV1, MERS-CoV, HCov-HKU1, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 Spike proteins was tested by
titration ELISA (Figure 4A). STE90-C11 bound specifically SARS-CoV-2 and did not show
any cross reactions to other human-pathogenic coronaviruses.

Because first SARS-CoV-2 mutants in patients are being identified (www.gisaid.org and
(Shi et al., 2020)) and more mutations within the RBD have been characterized to arise
under antibody selection pressure (Baum et al., 2020), S1 subunits harboring seven single
point mutations in the RBD were produced and binding of STE90-C11 to those mutants
was tested. A “worst-case-scenario” mutant containing all the 7 single point mutations,
termed S1-7PM, could also be produced (Figure 4B). All constructs were still able to
binding recombinant ACE2 (Supplementary Data 6), indicating correct folding. The
antibody STE90-C11 was able to bind to all of the investigated RBD mutations including
the “worst-case” S1-7PM mutant. STE90-C11 also inhibited ACE2 binding to all analyzed
S1 mutants in the cell-based inhibition assay (Figure 4C).

Biochemical characterization of STE90-C11
Aggregation propensity is an important quality parameter in therapeutic antibody
development. STE90-C11 showed no relevant aggregation under normal conditions
(pH7.4, 4°C in PBS), heat stress conditions (pH7.4, 45°C, 24h in PBS) and pH stress
(pH3, 24h, RT) (Supplementary Data 7). A further

test to exclude polyreactivity was

performed on different antigens (DNA, LPS, lysozyme and EXPI cell lysate) with the FDAapproved antibody Avelumab as control (Supplementary Data 8). Here, STE90-C11
showed equal or less unspecificity compared to Avelumab. The monovalent affinity of
STE90-C11 was determined by Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) in three different setups
(Supplementary Data 9). In the first setup, RBD-mFc was immobilized using anti-Fc
capture tips and the KD of STE90-C11 in monovalent Fab format was determined as 8.1
nM. In the second setup, the IgG was immobilized using a Fab2G capture tip and the K D of
monovalent S1-His was determined to be 1.6 nM. In the third assay, the IgG was
immobilized using a protein A capture tip, resulting in a measured K D of 6.5 nM to S1-His,

conferming the affinity of STE90-C11 is in the low nanomolar range. STE90-C11 does not
bind to RBD on immunoblots after treatment at 95°C and SDS-gel separation under
reducing conditions, while it was able to detect RBD when separated under non-reducing
conditions heated either at 95°C or 56°C (Supplementary Data 10). These data suggest
that the antibody recognizes a conformational epitope.

STE90-C11 binds at the ACE2-RBD interface
To get further insight into the neutralizing mechanism of STE90-C11, a complex of STE90C11 Fab and SARS-CoV-2 RBD (22 kDa fragment) was prepared and subjected to
crystallization screening. X-ray diffraction images collected from resulting crystals yielded
a dataset to an overall resolution limit of 2.0 Å (Supplementary Data 11). After solving the
structure by molecular replacement a model was built into the electron density (Figure 5).
Figure 5A shows the binding of STE90-C11 to RBD and Figure 5B the binding of ACE2 to
RBD. STE90-C11 binds SARS-CoV2 RBD with an interface area of 1113 Å 2 (Figure 5C,
Supplementary Data 12). Roughly 60% of this area can be contributed to the VH segment
forming up to ten hydrogen bonds at the same time and region dominated by hydrophobic
interaction (V99, A100, Y33, Y52) (Figure 5D). The remaining 40% are provided by the VL
segment contributing eight additional hydrogen bonds to stabilizing the interaction (Figure
5E). All six CDR loops contribute to the interaction between STE90-C11 Fab and SARSCoV-2 RBD. The superposition of the RBDs of the STE90-C11:SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex
with a ACE2:SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex (Lan et al., 2020) resulted in a low Cα root mean
square distance of 0.532 Å (183 atoms) indicating that binding of STE90-C11 did not
induce substantial changes in the RBD. The superposition further revealed that the
neutralization mechanism of STE90-C11 is based on directly competing for the ACE2
binding side, as the interaction interface on the RBD of both molecules almost completely

overlap. Further superposition of the STE90-C11:SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex model onto
cryo-EM models of the whole SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Walls et al., 2020) indicate that
due to steric hindrance STE90-C11 like ACE2 is expected to only bind to the open
conformation of the spike protein (Supplementary Data 13).

Discussion
For the treatment of COVID-19 but also to protect risk groups, human anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibodies are a promising therapeutic option. Human recombinant antibodies were
successfully used for the treatment of other viral diseases. Antibody mAb114 (Corti et al.,
2016) and the currently FDA approved three-antibody cocktail REGN-EB3 (Pascal et al.,
2018) showed a good efficiency in clinical trials against Ebola virus especially in
comparison to Remdesivir (Mulangu et al., 2019). For the treatment of a severe respiratory
infection of infants caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the antibody
Palivizumab is approved by EMA and FDA (van Mechelen et al., 2016; Subramanian et al.,
1998). These anti-viral antibodies can be used as blueprint to develop therapeutic
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Currently, monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
were selected by rescreening memory B-cells from a SARS patient (Pinto et al., 2020),
selected from COVID-19 patients by single B-cell PCR (Cao et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020)
or FACS sorting (Kreer et al., 2020), selected from transgenic mice followed and from
patients by single B-cells FACS sorting (Hansen et al., 2020) or using phage display using
universal or patient libraries including different antibody formats (Bertoglio et al., 2020; Li
et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020b; Zeng et al., 2020).
In this work, antibody phage display immune libraries were constructed using lymphocytes
from six local convalescent COVID-19 patients. 197 unique antibodies were selected
against RBD. We intently focused on RBD aiming to find antibodies which directly interfer
with the interaction between spike and ACE2, to avoid potential antibody dependent
enhancement (ADE). ADE during coronavirus entry has been described for both MERS
(Wan et al., 2020) or SARS (Wang et al., 2014). It is defined as "enhancement of disease
severity in an infected person or animal when an antibody against a pathogen...worsens its
virulence by a mechanism that is shown to be antibody-dependent" (Arvin et al., 2020).

Furthermore, immune dysregulation and lung inflammation was also caused by anti-spike
antibodies in an acute SARS-CoV infection (Liu et al., 2019). On the other hand, Quinlan
et al. (Quinlan et al., 2020) reported that animals immunized with RBD SARS-CoV-2 did
not mediate ADE. A therapeutic antibody directed against RBD and the usage of a Fc-part
which is not binding to Fc-gamma receptors ("silent Fc") would reduce the risk of ADE and
increase safety for human patients, in particular because ADE cannot be fully predicted
from in vitro studies or from animal models (Arvin et al., 2020).
The selected anti-RBD antibodies were analyzed for RBD::ACE2 inhibition in the scFv-Fc
format. The advantage of the IgG like bivalent scFv-Fc format is that it speeds up analysis
by requiring only one cloning step and provides high expression yields in small scale
format (Bertoglio et al., 2020; Jäger et al., 2013; Wenzel et al., 2020a). 30 scFv-Fc
antibodies inhibited the binding of the spike protein to ACE2-expressing living cells.
Interestingly, the majority of the VH V-genes of the selected anti-RBD antibodies and 28 of
these 30 inhibiting antibodies is the VH3-66 V-gene showing strong enrichment of this Vgene in the immune response of COVID-19 patients against RBD. This is in accordance
with Cao et al. (Cao et al., 2020) who found that enriched use of VH3-53 or VH3-66. VH353 and VH3-66 V-genes are closely related. Robbiani et al. (Robbiani et al., 2020) showed
an enrichment of VH3-30, VH3-53 and VH3-66 and Hansen et al. (Hansen et al., 2020)
reported a bias towards VH3-53. The VH3-53 and VH3-66 V-genes are closely related. In
contrast, Ju et al. (Ju et al., 2020) identified mainly VH1-2, VH3-48 and VH3-9 V-genes for
their selected anti-RBD antibodies from one patient and Brouwer et al. (Brouwer et al.,
2020) identified a strong enrichment of VH1-69, VH3-30 and VH1-24 in three patients, but
also an enrichment of VH3-53 and VH3-66. VH3-66 antibodies against RBD were also
selected from the naive HAL9/10 antibody gene libraries made long before the SARS-CoV2 outbreak (Kügler et al., 2015) but not significantly enriched (Bertoglio et al., 2020). The

selected inhibiting antibodies in our study (Table 1) all have a high germinality index and
are therefore very similar to the human germline, predicting low immunogenicity when
used as a therapeutic agent. Only some light chains have shown a major difference to
their closest related V-gene. Kreye et al. (Kreye et al., 2020) also described that their
antibodies selected from COVID-19 patients are very near to the germline genes.
Interestingly, the VH V-genes of these immune libraries are closer to their germline
compared to the anti-RBD antibodies selected from the naive HAL9/10 antibody gene
libraries (Bertoglio et al., 2020).
In the cell based inhibition assay, some of the antibodies show a molar antibody:spike
monomer ratio lower then 1:1. This was also shown by Bertoglio et al. (Bertoglio et al.,
2020) and can be explained by the three RBDs on the same spike trimer that can be in
different conformations ("up" and "down") and only the RBDs in "up" positions are able to
bind ACE2 (Walls et al., 2020) and therefore, the "down" RBDs are not fully accessible.
The monovalent affinity of STE90-C11 was measured with 1.6 nM-8.1 nM depending on
the BLI setup. This is in the same range as BD-368-2 with 0.82 nM affinity to RBD (Cao et
al., 2020), 3.3 nM for REGN10933 in the setup with the monovalent RBD (Hansen et al.,
2020). 70 nM for B38 (Wu et al., 2020) or 0.8-4.7 nM for CB6 (Shi et al., 2020).
The analysis of the binding STE90-C11 to other human coronaviruses showed specificity
for SARS-CoV-2. Comparison between the epitope of STE90-C11 and other published
antibodies (Figure 5F) revealed that it binds in the same region as CB6 (Shi et al., 2020)
and B38 (Wu et al., 2020). The selectivity of STE90-C11 and CB6 for SARS-CoV-2 over
SARS-CoV RBD can mainly be attributed to the interaction with residues 473-476, as they
are not involved in ACE2 binding and SARS-CoV RBD folds into a different conformation
of this loop causing steric hindrance for antibody binding (Lan et al., 2020).

The binding of STE90-C11 to S1 containing RBD mutations from COVID-19 patients was
analyzed, showing a binding to all mutants including a "worst case" mutant which
combined all seven analyzed mutations. As the cell based inhibition analysis demonstrate,
STE90-C11 is able to inhibiting all analyzed mutants, validating a tolerance for RBD
mutations. REGN10933 (Hansen et al., 2020), which is also binding at the RBD-ACE2
interface, showed a loss of neutralization in an assay using pseudoviral particles for the
F486V and a reduced neutralization for both G485D and E484K mutations (Baum et al.,
2020). Loss of binding to F486A is also described for VH-Fc ab8 (Li et al., 2020). In the
epitope analysis, REGN10933 has more molecular interactions within the region aa483aa486 compared to STE90-C11. Even though these RBD mutations are currently not
spread widely (www.GISAID.org), the imminent use of therapeutic antibodies will inevitably
result in escape mutants as already demonstrated by Baum et al. (Baum et al., 2020) in
vitro. Therefore, an antibody combination like REGN10933 + REGN10987 where both are
sensitive to some but different mutations, or an antibody like STE90-C11 which is tolerant
to mutations is needed.
We hypothesize that STE90-C11 is still binding to the analyzed RDB mutants because of
both the wide interface area of 1133 Å 2 and the extensive light chain contacts which may
compensate the exchange of several amino acids. The calculated interface area of
STE90-C11 VL is more than twice the area of REGN10933 and REGN10987 and slightly
larger compared to CB6 or CR3022 (Supplementary Data 12).
In summary, the patient-derived SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing anti-RBD antibody STE90-C11
binding to the RBD-ACE2 interface maintains high similarity to the human germline Vgenes VH3-66, the same family of many isolated anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.
Unlike other monoclonals, STE90-C11 is tolerant to known RBD mutants and therefore an
excellent candidate for therapeutic development.

Experimental models and subject detail
SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals and sample collection
For the generation of human immune antibody libraries against SARS-CoV-2, blood from
COVID-19 convalescent patients were collected from local hospitals. This was performed
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All the voluntary donors were informed
about the project and gave their consent. The use of blood samples for the development
of antibody phage display libraries was approved by the ethical committee of the
Technische Universität Braunschweig (Ethik-Kommission der Fakultät 2 der TU
Braunschweig, approval number FV-2020-02). The donors have given their consent for
study publication. A control serum was obtained from LADR Braunschweig.

The antigens were produced and purified as described before (Bertoglio et al., 2020;
Bleckmann et al., 2019). In brief, different domains or subunits of the Spike protein
(GenBank: MN908947) were produced Baculovirus-free in High Five cells (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Schwerte, Germany) by transient transfection. High Five cells were cultivated at
27°C, 110 rpm in ExCell405 media (Sigma Aldrich, Munich, Germany) and kept at a cell
density between 0.3 – 5.5 x10 6 cells/mL. For transfection cells were centrifuged and
resuspended in fresh media to a density of 4x10 6 cells/mL and transfected with 4 µg
plasmid/mL and 16 µg/mL of PEI 40 kDa (Polysciences). After 4 h to 24 h after transfection
cells were diluted to a final density of 1x 10 6 cells/mL. At 48 h after transfection, the culture
volume was doubled. Cell supernatant was harvested five days after transfection in a two
step centrifugation (4 min at 180xg and 20 min at above 3500xg) and 0.2 µm filtered for
purification.

Protein purification
Protein purification was performed as described before (Bertoglio et al., 2020) depending
on the production scale in either 24 well filter plate with 0.5 mL resin (10 mL scale) or 1 mL
column on Äkta go (Cytiva), Äkta Pure (Cytiva) or Profina System (BIO-RAD). MabSelect
SuRe or HiTrap Fibro PrismA (Cytiva) was used as resin for Protein A purification. For Histag purification of Expi293F supernatant HisTrap FF Crude column (Cytiva) and for His-tag
purification of insect cell supernatant HisTrap excel column (Cytiva) was used. All
purifications were performed according to the manufacturer's manual. Indicated antigens
were further purified by size exclusion chromatography by a 16/600 Superdex 200 kDa pg
(Cytiva). All antigens, antibodies and scFv-Fc were run on Superdex 200 Increase
10/300GL (Cytiva) on Äkta or HPLC (Techlab) on an AdvanceBio SEC 300Å 2.7 µm,
7.8x300 mm (Agilent) for quality control.

Serum ELISA
For COVID-19 convalescent serum analysis, sera were titrated from 1:314 in 11 steps
(dilution ratio 1:3.14) on 100 ng/well of RBD-His. As unspecificity controls, sera were
tested on 100 ng/well BSA. All immobilization steps were performed in 0.05 M carbonate
buffer (pH 9.6). Serum IgGs were detected using goat-anti-hIgG(Fc)-HRP (1:70,000,
A0170, Sigma). Titration assays were performed in 96 well microtiter plates (Costar) .

COVID-19 convalescent patient library construction
For the generation of human immune antibody libraries against SARS-CoV-2, blood from 6
donors showing a good antibody titer against RBD was used. The library construction was
performed as described previously with minor modifications (Kügler et al., 2018). In brief,
the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were extracted from the blood via Ficoll
(GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) and RNA isolated with TRIzol LS reagent (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, USA) and Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus kit (Zymo Research,
Freiburg, Germany). For the plasma B-cell sorted library, plasma B-cells were doublestained with mouse α-CD19 APC-conjugated (MHCD1905, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Schwerte,
Germany) and mouse α-CD138 (FITC conjugated) antibody (DL-101, BioLegend, San

Diego, USA), sorted via FACSMelody (BD, Franklin Lakes, USA). Sorted cells were
directly collected in TRIzol LS reagent and the RNA was extracted as indicated above.
RNA was converted into cDNA using Superscript IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Library construction was achieved as
described previously (Wenzel et al., 2020a) with slight modifications. In brief, specific
primers for the VH chain, kappa light chain and lambda light chain were used to amplify
antibody genes from the cDNA. These resulting PCR products were purified and again

amplified with primers adding specific restriction sites for further cloning into the E. coli
expression vector pHAL52. The vector pHAL52 is derived from the vector pHAL30 (Kügler
et al., 2015) with an AscI restriction site in the VL stuffer and a SalI restriction site in the
VH stuffer for removal of uncut vector backbone. First, the light chain was cloned between
the restriction sites MluI-HF and NotI-HF. In a second step the VH chain was cloned with
the restriction sites HindIII-HF and NcoI-HF into previously cloned pHAL52-VL, additionally
digested with AscI. The efficiency of library cloning was tested by colony PCR and the rate
of complete scFv insertion was determined. The libraries were packaged with Hyperphage
(Rondot et al., 2001; Soltes et al., 2007). Antibody phage were precipitated with PEG-NaCl
and resuspended in phage dilution buffer (10 mM TrisHCl pH7,5, 20 mM NaCl, 2 mM
EDTA). Resulting phage titer was determined by infection of E. coli XL1 blue MRF’.

Antibody selection using phage display
Antibody selection was performed as described previously with modifications (Russo et al.,
2018). In brief, 5 µg of of S1-S2-His or RBD-His (produced in High Five cells) was diluted
in carbonate buffer (50 mM NaHCO3/Na2CO3, pH 9.6) and coated onto the wells of a High
binding 96 well microtiter plate (High Binding, Costar) at 4 °C overnight. Next, the wells
were blocked with 350 µL 2% MBPST (2% (w/v) milk powder in PBS; 0.05% Tween20) for
1 h at RT and then washed 3 times with PBST (PBS; 0.05% Tween20). Before adding the
libraries to the coated wells, the libraries (5x10 10 phage particles) were preincubated with 5
µg of an unrelated scFv-Fc and 2% MPBST on blocked wells for 1 h at RT, to deprive
libraries of human Fc fragment binders. The libraries were transferred to the antigen
coated wells, incubated for 2 h at RT. After 10 washes, bound phages were eluted with 150
µL trypsin (10 µg/mL) at 37°C, 30 minutes and used for the next panning round. The eluted
phage solution was transferred to a 96 deep well plate (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen,

Germany) and incubated with 150 µL E. coli TG1 (OD600 = 0.5) firstly for 30 min at 37°C,
then 30 min at 37°C and 650 rpm to infect the phage particles. 1 mL 2xYT-GA (1.6% (w/v)
Tryptone; 1% (w/v) Yeast extract; 0.5% (w/v) NaCl (pH 7.0), 100 mM D-Glucose, 100
µg/mL ampicillin) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37°C and 650 rpm, followed by
addition of 1x1010 cfu M13KO7 helper phage. Subsequently, the infected bacteria were
incubated 30 min at 37°C followed by 30 min at 37°C and 650 rpm before centrifugation
for 10 min at 3220xg. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in fresh
2xYT-AK (1.6% (w/v) Tryptone; 1% (w/v) Yeast extract; 0.5% (w/v) NaCl (pH 7.0), 100
µg/mL ampicillin, 50 µg/mL kanamycin). The antibody phage were amplified overnight at
30°C and 650 rpm and used for the next panning round. In total four panning rounds were
performed. In each round, the stringency of the washing procedure was increased (20x in
panning round 2, 30x in panning round 3) and the amount of antigen was reduced (2.5 µg
in panning round 2, 1.5 µg in panning round 3). After third panning round single clones
were analyzed for production of RBD specific scFv by screening ELISA.

Screening of monoclonal recombinant binders using E. coli scFv supernatant
Soluble antibody fragments (scFv) were produced in 96-well polypropylene MTPs (U96
PP, Greiner Bio-One) as described before (Russo et al., 2018; Wenzel et al., 2020a).
Briefly, 150 μL 2xYT-GA was inoculated with the bacteria bearing scFv expressing
phagemids. MTPs were incubated overnight at 37°C and 800 rpm in a MTP shaker
(Thermoshaker PST-60HL-4, Lab4You, Berlin, Germany). A volume of 180 μL 2xYT-GA in
a PP-MTP well was inoculated with 20 μL of the overnight culture and grown at 37°C and
800 rpm for 90 minutes (approx. OD 600 of 0.5). Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation
for 10 min at 3220xg and the supernatant was discarded. To induce expression of the
antibody genes, the pellets were resuspended in 200 μL 2xYT supplemented with 100

at 30°C and 800 rpm overnight. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at
3220xg and 4°C.
For the ELISA, 100 ng of antigen was coated on 96 well microtiter plates (High Binding,
Costar) in PBS (pH 7.4) overnight at 4°C. After coating, the wells were blocked with
2% MPBST for 1 h at RT, followed by three washing steps with H2O and 0.05% Tween20.
Supernatants containing secreted monoclonal scFv were mixed with 2% MPBST (1:2) and
incubated onto the antigen coated plates for 1 h at 37°C followed by three H2O and 0.05%
Tween20 washing cycles. Bound scFv were detected using murine mAb 9E10 which
recognizes the C-terminal c-myc tag (1:50 diluted in 2% MPBST) and a goat anti-mouse
serum conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (A0168, Sigma) (1:42000 dilution in
2% MPBST). Bound antibodies were visualized with tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate
(20 parts TMB solution A (30 mM Potassium citrate; 1% (w/v) Citric acid (pH 4.1)) and 1
part TMB solution B (10 mM TMB; 10% (v/v) Acetone; 90% (v/v) Ethanol; 80 mM H2O2
(30%)) were mixed). After stopping the reaction by addition of 1 N H2SO4, absorbance at
450 nm with a 620 nm reference was measured in an ELISA plate reader (Epoch, BioTek).
Monoclonal binders were sequenced and analyzed using VBASE2 (www.vbase2.org)
(Mollova et al., 2010) and possible glycosylation positions in the CDRS were analyzed
according to Lu et al (Lu et al., 2019).

ScFv-Fc and IgG production
Unique scFv sequences isolated by antibody-phage display were subcloned into pCSE2.7hIgG1-Fc-XP using NcoI/NotI (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) for mammalian
production in Expi293F cells as scFv-Fc (Wenzel et al., 2020a). For IgG production, the
variable domains were recloned into the IgG vectors human IgG1 format by subcloning of

al (Armour et al., 1999) and Shields et al (Shields et al., 2001) were used: E233P, L234V,
L235A, deletion of G236, D265G, A327Q and A330S. Expi293F cells were cultured at
37°C, 110 rpm and 5% CO 2 in Gibco FreeStyle F17 expression media (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) supplemented with 8 mM Glutamine and 0.1% Pluronic F68 (PAN Biotech). At
the day of transfection cell density was between 1.5 - 2x10 6 cells/mL and viability at least
above 90%. For formation of DNA:PEI complexes 1 µg DNA/mL transfection volume and 5
µg of 40 kDa PEI (Polysciences) were first diluted separately in 5% transfection volume in
supplemented F17 media. DNA (1:1 ratio of the vectors for IgG production) and PEI was
then mixed and incubated ~25 min at RT before addition to the cells. 48 h later the culture
volume was doubled by feeding HyClone SFM4Transfx-293 media (GE Healthcare)
supplemented with 8 mM Glutamine. Additionally, HyClone Boost 6 supplement (GE
Healthcare) was added with 10% of the end volume. One week after transfection
supernatant was harvested by 15 min centrifugation at 1500xg.

Inhibition of S1-S2 and RBD binding to ACE2 expressing cells using flow cytometry
The inhibition tests in flow cytometry on EXPI293F cells were performed based on a
previously published protocol (Bertoglio et al., 2020). Briefly, Expi293F cells were
transfected according to the protocol above using pCSE2.5-ACE2 fl-His and 5% eGFP plasmid.

Two days after transfection, purified S1-S2-His was labelled using Monolith NTTM His-Tag
Labeling Kit RED-tris-NTA (Nanotemper) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In this

setup 50 nM antigen was incubated with min. 1 µM of different scFv-Fc and the ACE2
expressing cells. The resulting median antigen fluorescence of GFP positive living single
cells was measured. For comparison of the different scFv-Fc first the median fluorescence
background of cells without antigen was subtracted, second it was normalized to the
antigen signal where no antibody was applied. ScFv-Fc showing an inhibition in this first
setup were further titrated as IgGs (max. 500 nM- 0.5 nM) on S1-S2-His, S1-His or on
RBD-mFc (max. 100 nM-0.1 nM). S1-His and the corresponding mutants were detected
with mousen anti-penta His (Qiagen) and goat anti-mFc APC-conjugated antibody (Dianova).
RBD-mFc was detected directed with the goat anti-mFc APC-conjugated antibody (Dianova).
Measurments were performed with MACSQuant Analyzer (Milteny Biotech). The IC50 was

calculated using the equation f(x)=Amin+(Amax-Amin)/(1+(x0/x)^h)^s and parameters from
OriginPro (2019).

Dose dependent binding of IgG in titration ELISA
For titration ELISA, purified IgGs were titrated from 3.18 μg/mL- 0.001 ng/mL on 30 ng/well
of the following antigens: S1-S2-His (High Five cell produced), RBD-mFc (High Five cell
produced), S1-mFc (High Five cell produced) and TUN219-2C1-mFc (as control for
unspecific Fc binding). In addition, all scFv-hFc were also tested only at the highest
concentration (3.18 μg/mL) for unspecific cross-reactivity on Expi293F cell lysate (10 4
cells/well), BSA (1% w/v) and lysozyme. IgGs were detected using goat-anti-hIgG(Fc)HRP (1:70000, A0170, Sigma). Titration assays were performed using 384 well microtiter
plates (Greiner Bio-One) using Precision XS microplate sample processor (BioTek), EL406
washer dispenser (BioTek) and BioStack Microplate stacker (BioTek). EC50 were

Titration ELISAs on other coronaviruses and S1-HIS mutants were performed as described
above.

Screening and titrating monoclonal antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in cell
culture
VeroE6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were seeded at a density of 6*10 4/well onto cell culture
96-well plates (Nunc, Cat.#167008). Two days later, cells reached 100% confluence.
For titration, antibodies were diluted in 1/√10 steps and mixed with a fixed inoculum of
SARS-CoV-2/Münster/FI110320/1/2020 (kind gift of Stephan Ludwig, University of
Münster, Germany) (10-20, respectively 100-150 pfu) in a total volume of 500 µl of Vero E6
medium (DMEM, 10% FCS, 2 mM glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin). After one hour
incubation at 37°C, cells were infected with the antibody/virus mix, incubated for one hour
and then overlaid with Vero E6 medium containing 1.5% methyl-cellulose. Three days
postinfection, wells were imaged using a Sartorius IncuCyte S3 (4x objective, whole-well
scan) and plaques were counted from these images. Image data was quantified with the
IncuCyte S3 GUI tools measuring the decrease of confluence concomitant with the
cytopathic effect of the virus in relation to uninfected controls and controls without antibody
and analyzed with Origing using the Logistic5 fit.

Specificity assay
To test specificity of the antibody candidates an ELISA on DNA, LPS, lysozyme and cell
lysate was performed under standard conditions (see above). In brief, 10 µg/mL of the
respective antigen was immobilized on 96 well microtiter plates (High binding, Costar) in
PBS (pH 7.4) overnight at 4°C. After blocking 10 µg/mL of STE90-C11 IgG, Avelumab,

Palivizumab and IVIG respectively were incubated and later detected using goat-antihIgG(Fc)-HRP (1:70000, A0170, Sigma). TMB reaction took place for 30 min and
absorbance at 450 nm with a 620 nm reference was measured in an ELISA plate reader
(Epoch, BioTek). All signals were normalized to the absorbance of Avelumab.

Analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC)
All purified antigens and indicated antibodies were run on Superdex 200 Increase
10/300GL column (Cytiva) on Äkta pure system (Cytiva) according to the manufactures
protocol.

Affinity measurement by Bio-Layer Interferometry
The affinity was measured by Bio-Layer Interferometry in three different assays using the
Octet qKe (Fortebio/Sartorius GmbH, Göttingen, Germany).
In the first assay, anti-Mouse Fc-Capture (AMC) sensors were activated for 10 min in PBS.
After that, the sensors were equilibrated in assay buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA and
0.05% Tween 20) for 60 s before RBD-mFc (Sino Biologicals) was loaded onto the
sensors at 10 µg/ml for 180 s. After a stable baseline measurement was established (60
s), antigen-loaded sensors were transferred to an 8-point antibody dilution series (500,
158, 50, 15, 5, 1.5, 0.5 and 0 nM). Association of the Fab antibody to the antigen was
measured for 300 s. After that, the sensors were transferred into assay buffer were the
dissociation was measured for 900 s. Significant binding of the antibody to an unloaded
sensor was not detected. For data analysis, the reference measurement (0 nM) was
subtracted from the other measurements and data traces ranging from 158 to 1.5 nM were
used for modeling of the kinetic data using a 1:1 binding model.

In the second assay, anti-human Fab (FAB2G) sensors were activated for 10 min in PBS.
After that, the sensors were equilibrated in assay buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA and
0.05% Tween 20) for 60 s before the IgG antibody was loaded onto the sensors at 2.5
µg/ml for 180 s. After a stable baseline measurement was established (60 s), antibodyloaded sensors were transferred to an 8-point S1-HIS antigen dilution series (500, 158, 50,
15, 5, 1.5, 0.5 and 0 nM). Association of the S1 antigen to the antibody was measured for
300 s. After that, the sensors were transferred into assay buffer were the dissociation was
measured for 900 s. Significant binding of the antigen to an unloaded sensor was not
detected. For data analysis, the reference measurement (0 nM) was subtracted from the
other measurements and data traces ranging from 50 to 5 nM were used for modeling of
the kinetic data using a 1:1 binding model in the Data Analysis HT 11.0 software tool.
And in the third assay, protein A sensors were activated for 10 min in PBS. Before use, the
sensors were regenerated for 5 cycles in 10 mM Glycine buffer (pH2.0) followed by
neutralization in PBS. Each step was performed for 5 s. After that, the regenerated
sensors were equilibrated in assay buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20)

Immunoblot analysis
For the immunoblot analysis RBD-His was disrupted either by incubation for 10 minutes at
56°C without β-Mercaptoethanol, at 95°C without β-Mercaptoethanol or at 95°C in
Laemmli sample buffer (Laemmli, 1970) with β-Mercaptoethanol. RBD was separated by
12% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Protan 0.2 µm
NC, GE HealthCare). The membrane was blocked with 2% M-PBST for 1 h at RT. For the
detection of RBD-His, 10 µg/mL STE90-C11 IgG was used. For control, RBD-His (95°C +
β-Mercaptoethanol) was detected with 2µg/mL mouse anti-His (Dia-900-200, Dianova,
Hamburg, Germany) for 1.5 h at RT. After 3x washing with PBST the secondary antibody
goat anti-human Fc AP conjugated (1:20,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cambridge
House, UK) was used for the detection of STE90-C11 and goat anti-mouse IgG AP
conjugated (1:30,000, 115-055-071, Dianova) was used for the anti-His antibody and
incubated for 1 h. Finally, the membrane was washed 2x with PBST and 4x with PBS.
Staining and visualization of specific proteins was performed with 5-Brom-4-Chlor-3Indolyl-Phosphat/Nitro Tetrazolium Blue Chloride (NBT-BCIP, Thermo Fisher Scientific
GmbH, Dreieich, Germany) according to standard protocols.

Fab and RBD22 production for co-crystallization
The production of STE90-C11 Fab fragment was done by transient co-transfection of
plasmids encoding the heavy and the light chain in Expi293F cells cultivated at 37°C, 5%
CO2 and 100rpm in Expi Expression Medium. The transfection was performed at a density
of 3*10^6 cells/ml by adding 1µg/ml culture mixed plasmids and 4 µg/ml culture PEI 40
kDa (Polyscience). After 24h of incubation CHO CD efficient feed A (Thermo) to a final
concentration of 0.5% was added following incubation for an additional 48h. The
supernatant was harvested by centrifugation (30min, 3000g) and sterile filtration (0.2µm).

The Fab-fragment was purified by affinity chromatography using 1ml HisTrap Excel column
(GE Healthcare) followed by a size exclusion chromatography on a 10/300 Superdex200
Increase column (GE Healthcare) according to manufactures manual.
For the production of RBD22 High Five cells grown in Ex-Cell 405 serum-free medium
(Sigma) were transiently transfected with 5µg/mL plasmid and 20µg/mL PEI 40 kDa
(Polyscience) at a cell density of 5*10^6 cells/ml. After 4h incubation at 27°C and 100rpm
the cells were diluted to a density of 1*10^6 cells/ml and further incubated for three more
days. Following centrifugation (5000xg 30min) and sterile filtration (0.2µm) the supernatant
was loaded on a 5ml HisTrap Excel column (GE Healthcare). After washing and elution
with imidazole the RBD22 containing fractions were further purified by size exclusion
chromatography on a 26/6000 Superdex 200 pg using 20mM Tris-HCl pH8 and 150mM
NaCl as a buffer. Aliquots were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C till further
use.

Crystallization, data collection and structure determination
The Fab fragment of STE90-C11 was incubated overnight with a 1.2 molar excess of
purified RBD22 at 4°C. The Complex was isolated by size exclusion chromatography on a
Superdex 200 Increase 10/300GL (GE Healthcare) with 20mM Tris-HCl pH8 and 150mM
NaCl as a running buffer. Fractions containing the complex were concentrated utilizing a
Vivaspin2 ultrafiltration unit (10,000 MWCO; Sartorius). Crystallizations trails were set up
in 96‐well sitting‐drop vapor diffusion plates (Intelli 96 ‐3 plates, Art Robbins Instruments)
with a pipetting robot (Crystal Gryphon, Art Robbins Instruments) mixing 200nl reservoir
solution with 200nl of protein solution (14mg/mL, 7mg/mL) and equilibrated against 60 μl
of reservoir solution. As initial screens the Cryos Suite and the JCSGplus Suite (Qiagen)

The EC50 were measured on 30 ng immobilized RBD-mFc, S1-mFc, S1-S2-His (trimer) by ELISA. The IC50 was measured by flow cytometry using 50 nM (in relation to monomer)
S1-S2 trimer, respectively 10 nM RBD and ACE2 positive cells. The molar ration of antibody binding site: S1-S2 or RBD is given for 50% inhibition. /: not applicable. n.d.: not
determined. EC50 were calculated with GraphPad Prism Version 6.1, fitting to a four-parameter logistic curve. IC50 were calculated with OriginPro using the Logistic5 Fit. * the IC50
data of STE90-C11 were generated in the validation experiment shown in Supplementary Figure 5.
