Abstract

18
19

We are in the midst of the third severe coronavirus outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 with

20

unprecedented health and socio-economic consequences due to the COVID-19. Globally, the

21

major thrust of scientific efforts has shifted to the design of potent vaccine and anti-viral

22

candidates. Earlier genome analyses have shown global dominance of some mutations

23

purportedly indicative of similar infectivity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.

24

Using high-quality large dataset of 25k whole-genome sequences, we show emergence of new

25

cluster of mutations as result of geographic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in local population

26

(≥10%) of different nations. Using statistical analysis, we observe that these mutations have

27

either significantly co-occurred in globally dominant strains or have shown mutual exclusivity

28

in other cases. These mutations potentially modulate structural stability of proteins, some of

29

which forms part of SARS-CoV-2-human interactome. The high confidence druggable host

30

proteins are also up-regulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mutations occurring in potential

31

hot-spot regions within likely T-cell and B-cell epitopes or in proteins as part of host-viral

32

interactome, could hamper vaccine or drug efficacy in local population. Overall, our study

33

provides comprehensive view of emerging geo-clonal mutations which would aid researchers

34

to understand and develop effective countermeasures in the current crisis.

35
36

Significance

37
38

Our comparative analysis of globally dominant mutations and region-specific mutations in 25k

39

SARS-CoV-2 genomes elucidates its geo-clonal evolution. We observe locally dominant

40

mutations (co-occurring or mutually exclusive) in nations with contrasting COVID-19

41

mortalities per million of population) besides globally dominant ones namely, P314L (ORF1b)

42

and D164G (S) type. We also see exclusive dominant mutations such as in Brazil (I33T in

43

ORF6 and I292T in N protein), England (G251V in ORF3a), India (T2016K and L3606F in

44

ORF1a) and in Spain (L84S in ORF8). The emergence of these local mutations in ORFs within

45

SARS-CoV-2 genome could have interventional implications and also points towards their

46

potential in modulating infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in regional population.

Introduction

51
52

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has created an unprecedented global crisis. The evolving

53

SARS-CoV-2 viral variants have shown dominance (present in >50% genomes) of some

54

mutations indicating their concurrent emergence worldwide. However, co-dominance of

55

geographically distinct mutations may hamper global vaccine development and

56

pharmacological interventions. The genome organization of the 29kb SARS-CoV-2 (1)

57

involves 12 Open Reading Frames (ORF) encoding for ORF1a and 1b, surface glycoprotein -

58

Spike (S), ORF3a, envelope (E), membrane (M), ORF6, ORF7a and 7b, ORF8, nucleocapsid

59

(N) proteins and ORF10 (2,3). Our earlier phylogenetic analysis of >250 SARS-CoV-2 isolates

60

showed clustering of clinical samples in multiple clades derived from the molecular divergence

61

in ORF1ab/1b, S and ORF8 proteins (4). Subsequent analysis of isolates sequenced in India

62

showed higher mutational frequency in ORF1a from Indian samples (n=25) compared to global

63

isolates (n=3932) (5). This prompted us to look for similar dominant mutations, concurrent or

64

unique, present both globally and unique to nations with higher COVID-19 incidence namely

65

Brazil, India, Italy, Spain, UK and USA and compare it to countries where incidence was low,

66

Australia, Germany, Republic of Congo and Saudi Arabia. Here, we provide a comprehensive

67

report on the evolution of local clusters of mutations explored in a large dataset of >25k

68

genomes (whole genome sequences) from multiple geographical locations around the globe

69

and their co-occurrence or exclusivity with common global mutations. We further ascertained

70

effects of these mutations on the structural stability in the corresponding proteins, some of

71

which interact with host proteins, which were shown to be upregulated in patients with severe

72

COVD-19 symptoms. Identification of such mutations may further aid researchers in

73

developing broad spectrum vaccines or understanding variability in drug efficacy.

74
75

Methods

76
77

High quality, full length whole genome sequences of clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 were

78

downloaded from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (Table 1) (GISAID;

79

https://www.gisaid.org) (23). Glimmer was used for gene prediction (ORFs), and ORF

80

sequences with Ns were masked out and were not considered for protein translation (24).

81

Throughout, site numbering and genome structure are given using Wuhan-Hu-1

82

(NC_045512.2) as reference genome (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512).

83

MAFFT was used for ORF alignment and mutations were computed using BioInception’s in-

84

house pipeline based on R (https://cran.r-project.org/) and Python. Alignment regions with

85

>25% gaps against the reference genome were ruled out for amino acid mutational changes.

86

The change or mutation ratio for an ORF alignment is computed by the presence of a mutation

87

divided by total number of sequences in the alignment. This ratio is changed into a percentage.

88

Analysis of co-occurring or exclusive mutations (number of times two mutation occur together

89

in a clinical genome) across various ORFs was defined in terms of log-odds ratio (with p-value

90

and standard error) where a positive ratio indicates co-occurring mutations and negative value

91

denotes an exclusive mutation in the significant part of population using statsmodel

92

(Supplementary Data Sheet 1) (25). Structural effects of mutations on protein conformation,

93

flexibility and stability were predicted using DynaMut (26). The structural models were

94

retrieved from i-tasser COVID-19 database (27).

95
96

Results

97
98

Mutations occurring globally in ≥25% of the population

99
100

Here, we report recurrent occurrence of (i) global and (ii) local (region specific) non-

101

synonymous mutations present in >25K SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates (Table 1). To achieve

102

better signal-to-noise ratio, we have used a double layered protocol to identify statistically

103

significant signature mutations. In general, recurrent or dominant mutations occurring in ≥10%

104

of the functional genome (ORFs), compared to Wuhan_HU-1 (NC_045512), were classified

105

into mutually exclusive or co-occurring (mutations which also have the propensity to exist

106

together with another mutation). These were defined using log-odds ratio (LOR) where a

107

positive or negative log-odds value represents co-occurring and mutually exclusive mutations,

108

respectively. Vibrational entropy changes were predicted for both wild type and mutant

109

proteins for evaluating the impact of mutations on conformation, flexibility and stability of

110

proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome can be classified into ORF1a, ORF1b (or ORF1ab joint),

111

S, E, ORF7a, ORF7b, N, ORF8 and ORF 10. ORF1a and ORF1b code for polyproteins which

112

are further cleaved to non-structural proteins (nsp), necessary for infection and replication of

113

virus. Our analysis revealed high propensity mutations present in the ORF1a and 1b, S, ORF3a,

114

ORF6, ORF8 and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1, Supplementary Table 1). Our findings

115

agree with earlier reports on global co-occurrence of P314L (70.97%) and D614G (71.57%)

116

mutations in ORF1b (corresponding to P323L in nsp12) and S proteins, respectively.

117

Subsequently, high occurrence of mutation Q57H (25.54%) in ORF3a protein, R203K

118

(24.34%) and G204R (24.29%) in N protein (Supplementary Table 1) was globally reported.

119

They were also found to be widely accumulated in North American and European populations

120

(6).

121
122

A comparative study between region specific mutations and globally dominant mutations

123
124

By capturing the most prominent mutations present in samples (through application of a coarse

125

data filter for mutations present in >25% of samples), our hierarchical (ward based) clustering

126

analysis of regional isolates placed European nations (except Spain and Scotland) and Brazil

127

into one cluster and Australia, India, Saudi Arabia, Scotland, Spain, USA, and DRC into

128

another cluster (Figure 2). Brazil and India, however, do not cluster with the rest of populations

129

and seem to possess distinct signature mutations, indicating early signs of genetic drift. In

130

isolates obtained from populations with the incidence of over a hundred mortalities per million

131

e.g. Italy, England, Wales, we observed positive log-odds ratio amongst mutations P314L-

132

D614G (LOR: 10.75, p-value 0.0) and R203K-G204R (LOR: 14.39, p-value 4.089e-146).

133

Interestingly Germany and Italy (with contrasting mortalities per million of population) (7)

134

show similar mutation signatures in their genomes. However, in relatively high viral burden

135

populations such as in Spain, we observed mutually exclusive presence of L84S (ORF8)

136

mutation along with globally occurring mutations P314L (ORF1b) and D614G (S) (Figure 1).

137

Whereas in the USA, T265I (ORF1a) and Q57H (ORF3a) were highly concurrent with P314L-

138

D614G mutations. The globally dominant P314L, D614G and Q57H were predicted to be

139

stabilizing mutations for nsp12, S and ORF3a proteins, respectively (Table 2). Similarly, other

140

mutations were predicted to confer mild stabilization or destabilization effects on respective

141

proteins (∆∆G -0.64 to 0.46 kcal.mol-1) (Table 2).

142
143

Specific (present only in the particular region within the cut-off limit) mutations - L3606F

144

(corresponding to L37F in nsp6) (30.96%) and T2016K (corresponding to T1198K in nsp3)

145

(26.61%) both in ORF1a, A88V (corresponding to A97V in nsp6) (25.67%) in ORF1b and

146

P13L (31.24%) in Nucleoprotein (N protein) were present in Indian isolates and did not co-

147

occur with P314L, D614G type (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Data Sheet 1). The

148

outlier Indian samples could be attributed to these mutations which can account for an entirely

149

separate Indian clade. Though the L3606F mutation also occurs in

150

Australia, DRC, England and Wales, the P13L, T2016K mutant strains seem to have newly co-

25% of isolates from

151

evolved with L3606F variants in later stages of transmission in India. Brazil, another outlier,

152

has two distinct mutations I33T (52.53%) in ORF6 and I292T (59.6%) in N protein which were

153

absent in other nations. These co-occurred with P314L and D614G unlike the Indian exclusive

154

mutations L3606F, T2016K and P13L which did not co-occur. The Brazilian exclusive

155

mutations I33T and I292T co-occurred with P314L, D614G, R203K and G204R. It is also

156

worth noting that within the N protein, the Indian and Brazilian isolates show different country

157

specific mutations - P13L and I292T mutations, respectively. Stability analysis on these

158

mutations predicted induction of significant and contrasting conformational changes in N

159

protein. The P13L mutation was predicted to induce high stabilization (∆∆G 2.25 kcal.mol-1)

160

owing to hydrophobic interactions of mutated Leu with Ala152 (Supplementary Figure 1). On

161

the contrary, the I292T (exclusive in Brazil) was predicted to destabilize N protein (∆∆G -1.99

162

kcal.mol-1). The destabilization was observed due to changes in weak H-bond interactions in

163

the vicinity of T292 (Supplementary Figure 2).

164
165

Mutations occurring in more than 10% of population

166
167

While prominent mutations (by applying a coarse data filter for mutations present in >25% of

168

samples) yielded specific mutations in isolates from India, Brazil, USA and Spain, further

169

reducing the cut-off to ≥10% showed additional country specific signature mutations in

170

different ORFs (Figure 3). Geographically defined genomic evolution is expected. In United

171

Kingdom, country specific mutations were observed in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and

172

Scotland. Mutations in England (G251V in ORF3a), Wales (G392D, A876T in ORF1a; S193I

173

in N protein), Scotland (S194L in N protein) and Northern Ireland (P2144L and T3579I in

174

ORF1a) displayed mutual exclusivity (negative LOR) with P314L, D614G and R203K, G204R

175

mutations. Interestingly in England, the G251V mutation was highly concurrent with L3606F

176

mutation of nsp6. Contrarily in Wales, the G392D, A876T and S193I mutations (which have

177

high propensity to co-occur together, showed mutual exclusivity with the L3606F mutation

178

(Supplementary Data Sheet 1). The P2144L and T3579I mutations showed a high propensity

179

to co-occur in Northern Ireland population. Distribution of co-occurring and exclusive

180

mutations in United Kingdom clearly shows G392D, A876T, S193I for Wales and P2144L,

181

T3579I as specific for Northern Ireland, distinct from England.

182
183

Antigenic drift is believed to occur due to immune pressure resulting in selection of viruses

184

that can escape, hence exploring mutations will aid towards vaccine design and development

185

(8). Virus circulating in humans undergo antigenic drift, thus necessitating periodic updates to

186

the virus strains contained in the seasonal vaccine to maintain a good match with circulating

187

viruses (9) (10). In general, variations in the virus can lead to reduced efficacy and narrow

188

protection from most vaccinations. The mutating strains might weaken the memory B cells that

189

have the capacity to generate and improve antibody response to new infection. A correlation

190

of the occurrence of hotspot mutations within potential T cell and B cell epitopes revealed that

191

F3071Y and L3606F (ORF1a) are within the epitope regions predicted for both CD4+ and

192

CD8+ T cell activity (11). The R203K and G204R from N protein have a strong propensity for

193

B cell epitopes.

194
195

Discussion

196
197

The viral mutation rates (12) are important for understanding the tractability of using variable

198

regions as vaccine candidates and how virus populations will respond to the application of a

199

mutagen (13). Bioinformatics and computational biology can assist in the discovery of

200

conserved epitopes through sequence variability analysis (14). This is particularly relevant

201

when dealing with virus capable of evading the immune system due to their high mutation

202

rates. These approaches, combined with experimental evolution and deeper mechanistic

203

studies, will aid in the understanding of whether mutation rates are likely to change in the

204

future. While our observations on geographical distribution of mutations could indicate

205

significant public health outcomes, these also raises fundamental questions on the likely basis

206

for emergence of such mutations as a function of geography. A number of factors such as

207

differences in the microbiome population in a given region, drug pressure, and host genetics

208

could be attributed. In separate studies on various human infecting viruses, it has been shown

209

that commensal microbiome can prime the viral infections in hosts (15). The ongoing long and

210

short term evolutions in the microbiome may further add complexity to our understanding of

211

host shaped viral adaptations (16). Drug selection pressures can also work at regional and sub-

212

regional levels (17,18). Analysis of mutation rates are equally crucial in terms of protein-

213

protein interactions within coronavirus ORFeome and host-pathogen interaction interface. In

214

SARS-CoV, nsp2, nsp8 (both part of ORF1ab) and ORF9b were shown to interact with other

215

viral proteins (19). For instance, nsp8 (part of ORF1ab) showed prominent interactions with

216

replicase proteins including nsp2, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14 (all part of

217

ORF1ab), indicating crucial role of intra-viral protein-protein interactions in replication

218

machinery. The mutations in ORFs could be equally crucial in terms of host-viral interactome.

219

Shen Bo et. al. (20) classified severity of COVID-19 on the basis of differential expression of

220

93 serum proteins and 204 metabolite signatures, highlighting immune and metabolic

221

dysregulation in COVID-19 patients.

222
223

Another study by Gordon et. al. (21) identified physical interactions of host (human) proteins

224

with SARS-CoV-2. Protein-protein interactome (PPI) analysis yielded 332 high confidence

225

druggable human proteins which are involved in protein trafficking, transcription-translation

226

and ubiquitination regulation. We observed three common proteins in these studies (20,21)

227

which are both high confidence druggable targets and dysregulated between healthy and severe

228

COVID-19 symptoms. Two of these proteins; CD antigen CD155 and gamma-Glu-X

229

carboxypeptidase were shown to interact with ORF8, while the other glycoprotein GP36b with

230

nsp7. These proteins are involved in immune regulation and other metabolic processes (22).

231

These studies present likely evidence that mutations in these ORFs interacting druggable host

232

proteins could perturb host-pathogen interactome, host immune responses or modulate

233

therapeutic efficacy of anti-viral agents. The conspicuous distribution of co-occurring or

234

exclusive mutations in the non-structural proteins; ORF1ab, ORF3a, ORF8 and N proteins of

235

SARS-CoV-2 could be indicative of one or more of the following: a) Perturbations within

236

SARS-CoV-2 proteome; b) Human-SARS-CoV-2 interactome or, c) Alteration of

237

pharmacological profile of either known, or newly designed anti-viral candidates.

238
239

The current work highlights specific mutations in the functional genome of SARS-CoV-2

240

occurring worldwide and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 across different regions. While earlier

241

reports have suggested the dominance of P314L and D614G subtype, we show additional

242

dominance of other exclusive mutations in various countries like India, England Spain, and

243

Brazil (Figure 1, 2). While the exact role of such mutations in conferring disease phenotype

244

still needs to be deciphered, the proposed structural-mutation correlations for some of these

245

mutations point toward their role in governing functional genome pathogenicity of SAR-CoV-

246

2. The mutually dependent or exclusive role of these crucial mutations in global isolates is

247

indicative of clonal geo-distribution, which may affect infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in localized

248

population. The identification of potential signature mutations in the evolving SARS-CoV-2

249

genome will aid the development of vaccines, drugs and diagnostics.
