Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 originated in animals and is now easily transmitted between people.

31

Sporadic detection of natural cases in animals alongside successful experimental infections of

32

pets, such as cats, ferrets and dogs, raises questions about the susceptibility of animals under

33

natural conditions of pet ownership. Here we report a large-scale study to assess SARS-CoV-2

34

infection in 817 companion animals living in northern Italy, sampled at a time of frequent human

35

infection. No animals tested PCR positive. However, 3.4% of dogs and 3.9% of cats had

36

measurable SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers, with dogs from COVID-19 positive

37

households being significantly more likely to test positive than those from COVID-19 negative

38

households. Understanding risk factors associated with this and their potential to infect other

39

species requires urgent investigation.

43

humans (2), and rapidly spread worldwide becoming a pandemic (3). Although the virus is

44

believed to spread almost exclusively by human-to-human transmission, there are concerns that

45

some animal species may contribute to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic epidemiology (4).

46

To date, sporadic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported in dogs and cats. These

47

include detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory and/or fecal specimens of dogs and cats

48

with or without clinical signs (5-7), as well as of specific antibodies in sera from pets from

49

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affected areas (7,8). In addition, experimental infection of

50

various animal species has demonstrated that while dogs appear poorly susceptible to SARS-

51

CoV-2 infection, developing asymptomatic infections and shedding low-titer or no virus, cats

52

develop respiratory pathology and shed high titers of SARS-CoV-2, even being able to infect in-

53

contact animals (9,10). Wide scale testing of susceptible species is needed to assess the extent of

54

animal infection under more natural conditions of husbandry. Here, we conducted an extensive

55

epidemiological survey from March to May 2020 in cats and dogs living in Italy, either in

56

SARS-CoV-2 positive households or living in geographic areas that were severely affected by

57

COVID-19. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to investigate SARS-CoV-2 in

58

companion animals to date.

59

All animals were sampled by their private veterinary surgeon during routine healthcare visits.

60

Sampling of animals for this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of

61

Veterinary Medicine, University of Bari, Italy (approval number 15/2020). A total of 540 dogs

62

and 277 cats were sampled from different Italian regions, mostly Lombardy (476 dogs, 187 cats).

63

Animals were sampled either from regions severely affected by COVID-19 outbreaks in humans

64

or from those that offered convenient access to samples. Oropharyngeal (306 dogs, 175 cats),

65

nasal (185 dogs, 77 cats), and/or rectal (66 dogs, 30 cats) swabs were collected from the sampled

66

pets. For 340 dogs and 188 cats, full signalment and clinical history were available, including

67

breed, sex, age, exposure to COVID-19 infected humans (COVID-19 positive household,

68

suspected COVID-19 positive household but not confirmed by specific assay, and COVID-19

69

negative household), presence of respiratory signs (cough, sneezing, conjunctivitis, nasal and/or

70

ocular discharge).

71

Sera were available for 188 dogs and 63 cats for which complete signalment, history and location

72

were available (Fig. 1). Additional sera were collected from diagnostic laboratories for 200 dogs

73

and 89 cats from the affected areas, but which lacked further historical information.

74

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA used two real-time RT-PCR assays targeting nucleoprotein and

75

envelope protein genes as previously described (11). Plaque reduction neutralization tests

76

(PRNT) were using a previously established protocol (8) with SARS-CoV-

77

2/human/Liverpool/REMRQ0001/2020 isolate was cultured as previously described (9).

78

PRNT80 was determined by the highest dilution with 80% reduction in plaques compared to

79

the control.

80

All of 839 collected swab samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including 38 cats and

81

38 dogs that showed respiratory symptoms at the time of sampling, suggesting absence of active

82

SARS-CoV-2 infection in the tested animals. In addition, 64 of these dogs and 57 of the cats that

83

tested negative were living in households previously confirmed as having had COVID-19.

84

SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were detected in 13 dogs (3.35%) and 6 cats (3.95%), with

85

titers ranging from 1:20 to 1:160 and from 1:40 to 1:1280 in dogs and cats, respectively. Of

86

samples from households with known COVID-19 status, neutralizing antibodies were detected in

87

6 of 47 dogs (12.8%) and 1 of 22 cats (4.5%) from COVID-19 positive households, 1 of 7 dogs

88

(14.3%) and 0 of 3 cats (0%) from suspected COVID-19 positive households and 2 of 133 dogs

89

(1.5%) and 1 of 38 cats (2.6%) from COVID-19 negative households (Table 1). For those 423

90

animals where an age was recorded, 0 of 30 aged less than 1 year (0%), 6 of 92 aged 1-3 years

91

(6.5%), 3 of 102 aged 4-7 years (2.9%) and 6 of 199 aged 8 and over (3.0%) tested positive.

92

None of the animals with neutralizing antibodies displayed respiratory symptoms at the time of

93

sampling.

94

Reference sera or ascitic fluids from animals previously shown to be positive for canine enteric

95

coronavirus (14), canine respiratory coronavirus (15) and feline coronavirus (16) tested negative

96

by the PRNT assay for SARS-CoV-2, confirming the specificity of the obtained results (8).

97

Dogs were significantly more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies if

98

they came from a known COVID-19 positive household (Fisher’s exact test, p=0.004) or were

99

male (Fisher’s exact test, p=0.045). In provinces where at least 10 samples were available, there

100

was a strong positive trend between the proportion of dogs that tested positive and the recorded

101

burden of human disease (Spearman’s r = 0.732, p = 0.051) (Fig. 2). A similar association was

102

observed for cats but should be viewed with caution as only four provinces met the criteria for

103

analysis.

104

Following its original probable transmission to humans from animals, SARS-CoV-2 has spread

105

globally within the human population with devastating health and economic impacts. To date,

106

SARS-CoV-2 has been sporadically detected in naturally infected dogs and cats, most of which

107

were living in close contact with infected humans. Most studies of companion animals are small

108

in nature, likely because of an inevitable research focus on human disease. Our results from this

109

extensive study of SARS-CoV-2 infection in owned cats and dogs living in areas where viral

110

transmission was active in the human population demonstrate that both cats and dogs can

111

seroconvert under the normal conditions of pet ownership, and where the burdens of disease are

112

highest in humans.

113

The link between SARS-CoV-2 household infection and a pet’s seropositivity was only apparent

114

for dogs, possibly suggesting greater interaction between positive people and their household

115

dogs as compared to cats. This contrasts experimental studies where dogs were less susceptible

116

to infection (9). In addition, a higher proportion of male dogs were seropositive compared to

117

female dogs. Future studies in animals and humans should investigate whether this phenomenon

118

is based in physiological or behavioral differences between males and females. Although there

119

are clear gender differences in outcomes in human COVID-19 infections, with males at higher

120

risk of severe disease, there seems to be no evidence for a difference in infection risk (17). None

121

of the 30 juvenile animals, less than one year-of-age, tested positive. Our findings are consistent

122

with reports of other seropositive naturally exposed cats and dogs which were all adult (6, 7).

123

These findings support use of older animals in experimental infections, which are currently

124

performed on animals less than one year-of-age (9) and may therefore underestimate SARS-

125

CoV-2 susceptibility.

126

In contrast to the serology results, all animals tested negative by PCR, including those animals

127

living in households with confirmed COVID-19 human infection and those with and without

128

respiratory symptoms. This suggests that whilst pet animals can seroconvert, they may shed virus

129

for relatively short periods of time. In experimental studies, cats stopped shedding virus by 10

130

days post infection (dpi) and developed neutralizing antibody responses by 13 dpi (9). Similar

131

results were reported in experimental infection of dogs, in which virus was detected in faeces up

132

to 6 dpi, but not in oropharyngeal swabs (6). However, in a naturally infected Pomeranian dog

133

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected from nasal swabs by quantitative RT-PCR for at least 13 days

134

at low titer, whilst the virus was not detected in faecal/rectal samples (7), suggesting that virus

135

shedding patterns may vary in some animals. Half of the challenged dogs had detectable

136

antibodies by 14 dpi. These studies and our own highlight similar challenges in detecting SARS-

137

CoV-2 infection that exist for both humans and animals (18). It is not possible with our field data

138

set to estimate the time of infection in animals that were seropositive, and restrictions on human

139

and animal movement during the pandemic may have delayed visits to veterinary practitioners

140

where sampling occurred. We advocate the inclusion of pets in ongoing assessments of

141

community and household shedding to improve detection of active infection.

142

In this extensive epidemiological survey of SARS-CoV-2, we found that companion animals

143

living in areas of high human infection can become infected. Our results suggest that dogs

144

warrant further investigation regarding SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility in contrast to experimental

145

studies which suggested cats were most susceptible (9). We also observed seropositivity rates in

146

animals comparable to those of humans via community sampling at a similar time in European

147

countries (19-21). This suggests that infection in companion animals is not unusual. Based on

148

current knowledge, it is unlikely that infected pets play an active role in SARS-CoV-2

149

transmission to humans. However, animal-to-human transmission may be more likely under

150

certain environmental conditions, such as the high animal population densities encountered on

151

infected mink farms (22). As and when human transmission becomes rarer and contact tracing

152

becomes more accessible, serological surveillance of pets may be advocated to develop a

153

wholistic picture of community disease dynamics and ensure that all transmission opportunities

154

are terminated.

Samples

281

All animals were sampled by their private veterinary surgeon during a healthcare visit for other

282

reasons. A total of 540 dogs and 277 cats were sampled from different Italian regions, mostly

283

Lombardy (476 dogs, 187 cats). Animals were sampled either from regions severely affected by

284

COVID-19 outbreaks in humans or from those that offered convenient access to samples.

285

Oropharyngeal (306 dogs, 175 cats), nasal (185 dogs, 77 cats), and/or rectal (66 dogs, 30 cats)

286

swabs were collected from the sampled pets. For 340 dogs and 188 cats, full signalment and

287

clinical history were available, including breed, sex, age, exposure to COVID-19 infected

288

humans (COVID-19 positive household, suspected COVID-19 positive household but not

289

confirmed by specific assay, and COVID-19 negative household), presence of respiratory signs

290

(cough, sneezing, conjunctivitis, nasal and/or ocular discharge).

291

Sera were available for 188 dogs and 63 cats for which complete signalment, history and location

292

were available (Figure 1). Additional sera were collected from diagnostic laboratories for 200

293

dogs and 89 cats from the affected areas, but which lacked further historical information.

294

Sampling of animals for this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of

295

Veterinary Medicine, University of Bari, Italy (approval number 15/2020).

Polymerase chain reaction

298

Sample preparation and RNA extraction were carried out in the biosafety level 3 containment

299

laboratory at the Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bari, Italy. Detection of

300

SARS-CoV-2 RNA used two real-time RT-PCR assays targeting nucleoprotein and envelope

301

protein genes as previously described (11).

302
303

Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)

304

The SARS-CoV-2/human/Liverpool/REMRQ0001/2020 isolate was cultured in Vero E6 cells as previously

305

described (12). PRNTs were performed as previously described (13). Briefly, sera were heat inactivated at 56°C for

306

1 hour and stored at -20°C until use. Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 2% fetal bovine

307

serum (FBS) and 0.05 mg/mL gentamicin was used for serial two-fold dilutions of serum. SARS-CoV-2 at 800

308

PFU/mL was added to an equal volume of diluted serum and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. The virus-serum dilution

309

was inoculated onto Vero E6 cells, incubated at 37°C for 1 hour, and overlaid as in standard plaque assays. Cells

310

were incubated for 48 hours at 37°C and 5% CO2 then fixed with 10% formalin and stained with 0.05% crystal

311

violet solution. PRNT80 was determined by the highest dilution with 80% reduction in plaques compared to the

312

control. Samples with detectable neutralizing antibody titer were repeated as technical replicates for confirmation.

313
314

Data analysis

315

Fisher’s exact test was used to analyze differences in antibody detection from households with known COVID-19

316

infection status, and antibody detection from male and female animals. Spearman correlation was used to analyze

317

the relationship between human COVID-19 case numbers and detection of antibodies in animals. All statistical

318

analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism.
