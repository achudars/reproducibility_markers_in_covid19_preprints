ABSTRACT
Community transmission of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a major public health
concern that remains difficult to assess. We present a genomic survey of SARS-CoV-2 from a
during the first 10 weeks of COVID-19 activity in New South Wales, Australia. Transmission
events were monitored prospectively during the critical period of implementation of national
control measures. SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced from 209 patients diagnosed with
COVID-19 infection between January and March 2020. Only a quarter of cases appeared to be
locally acquired and genomic-based estimates of local transmission rates were concordant with
predictions from a computational agent-based model. This convergent assessment indicates
that genome sequencing provides key information to inform public health action and has
improved our understanding of the COVID-19 evolution from outbreak to epidemic.

MAIN TEXT
In January 2020, a novel betacoronavirus (Coronaviridae), named Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the etiologic agent of a cluster of
pneumonia cases occurring in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which were first reported
in late December 20191,2. The disease arising from SARS-CoV-2 infection, Coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), subsequently spread rapidly worldwide. The World Health
Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11th 2020, when 118,000
cases had been reported from 110 countries. As of 18th April 2020, the number of global cases
had surpassed 2,000,000, following multiple worldwide independent importations of infection
from visitors and returned travellers making the control of this disease of prime global public
health importance3,4. Major outbreaks have been documented in South Korea, Iran, the USA
and Europe2,3. At the time of writing, person-to-person transmission had been documented
primarily through household contacts5, with up to 85% of human-to-human transmission
occurring in family or household clusters6,7. The rapid growth in the number of COVID-19
cases with associated morbidity and mortality has overburdened healthcare facilities and the
workforce. However, our understanding of the natural history and mechanisms of disease
spread remain limited.
These events, combined with estimations from epidemic models, have led to
unprecedented measures of disease control being instituted by national governments with
profound costs to citizens and economies. Epidemic models of COVID-19 have suggested that
virus transmission can be significantly disrupted by rapid detection and quarantine of infectious
cases and their close contacts8. However, validation of COVID-19 modelling predictions is
becoming increasingly important since many are built using incomplete and inconsistent data
and thus produce divergent outcomes9,10, thus affecting confidence in public health policy
directions. Here, we use the combination of near real-time SARS-CoV-2 genomic and public
health surveillance data to verify inferences from computational models. Genomic
epidemiology has become a high-resolution tool for public health surveillance and disease
control11-13 and the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered unrivalled efforts for the real-time
genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have
already been sequenced and made publicly available on GISAID (the Global Initiative on
Sharing All Influenza Data)14. Importantly, the ongoing analysis of this global data set suggests
no significant differences or links between SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence variability and
virus transmissibility or disease severity15. However, even during these early stages of the
global pandemic, genomic surveillance has been used to differentiate currently circulating

strains into distinct, geographically based lineages and reveal multiple SARS-CoV-2
importations into geographical regions of China and the USA16,17.
Australia, as an island country between the Pacific and Indian oceans with strong traffic
of people to and from COVID-19 hotspots in Asia, Europe and North America, has experienced
unique challenges and opportunities in responding to the pandemic. The first laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 patients were diagnosed in Melbourne and Sydney on 25th and 26th of
January 2020, respectively. Since then, and as of the end of this study period on March 29th
2020, 4159 cases had been confirmed in Australia with 1981 cases (47.6%) occurring in New
South Wales (NSW), the most populous state of Australia (24.5/100,000 population)18. The
Australian Government introduced progressive epidemic mitigation measures on 23rd March
2020 to limit social interactions, reduce virus diffusion and prevent community-based
transmissions. This strategy has been supported by widely available testing for SARS-CoV-2
in NSW, with 1541 tests performed per 100,000 residents19.
In this study, we examine the value of near-real time genome sequencing of SARSCoV-2 in understanding of local transmission pathways during the containment stage of the
COVID-19 epidemic and compare findings from the genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2
with predictions of a computational agent-based model. This comparison was performed to
assess the impact of potential sampling bias in genomic surveillance as well as to validate
model-based inferences using experimental data. The synergistic use of high-resolution
genomic surveillance and computational agent-based modelling not only improves our
understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains in the community and the evolution of this
novel virus but is essential for helping mitigate community-based transmissions.

Results
Sampling COVID-19 cases in the first phase of the Australian epidemic. Between January
26th and March 28th, 1617 cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed and reported to the NSW
Ministry of Health. All patients resided in metropolitan Sydney. Prior to February 29th, only
four cases of COVID-19 were detected in NSW, all of which were imported. The first locally
acquired case in NSW was reported on March 3rd, following which a sharp spike in both
imported and locally acquired cases occurred during the week commencing March 15th (Fig.
1). Between March 1st and 21st, the weekly proportion of imported cases was between 5 and
20%. During the same period, cases epidemiologically defined as ‘unknown origin/under
investigation’ increased from none during the week beginning March 1st to between 31 and
35% from March 8th to 21st (Fig. 1c).

Rapid high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 sequencing directly from clinical samples. Of the
1,617 COVID-19 cases reported during the study period, complete viral genomes were
obtained from 209 (13%) (Fig. 1a). Following an initial delay of 21 days between date of
collection and the first sequencing run for the first three samples received, the median number
of days between clinical sample collection and sequencing was five days (range: 1 – 21 days;
Fig. 1b). The proportion of COVID-19 cases sequenced weekly peaked during the week
beginning March 1st, at 25%. Consensus genome sequences were obtained from all specimens
with RT-PCR Ct values <30. The amplicon sequencing method utilised in this study provided
consistently complete, high quality consensus sequences with a median coverage depth
between 277.4 and 3409.1 (Supplement Table S1). No significant changes in the amplicon
primer sites were detected during the study.
Evaluating phylogenetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in NSW in January-March
2020. The 209 NSW SARS-CoV-2 genomes were dispersed across the global SARS-CoV-2
phylogeny (Fig. 2a). Notably, the majority of genomes from imported NSW cases grouped
with viral sequences from the country of origin. All major genomic lineages of SARS-CoV-2
were detected in NSW (Fig. 2a, Supplement Table S1), including the introduction and then
local transmission of lineage B.4.2 which is dominated by genomes from Australia that are
believed to be imported from Iran (24).
Close genomic similarity of SARS-CoV-2 in epidemiologically linked cases. Phylogenetic
analysis identified multiple independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into NSW over time.
SARS-CoV-2 from 10 patients (five household contacts pairs) were indistinguishable (three of
five pairs) or differed by a single SNP (two of five pairs). However, institutional outbreaks,
where cases could have only contracted the virus within the institution, demonstrated more
genomic diversity. Three institutional outbreaks representing 35, 17 and 12 cases demonstrated
up to two SNP differences between genomes during the outbreak. The duration of these three
institutional outbreaks was between six and 17 days. We therefore chose to define clusters as
sequences that differ by no more than 2 SNPs from the index case of each outbreak. In this
study 27 clusters were identified, of which eight (29.6%) consisted of two cases and 11 (40.7%)
consisted of five or more cases. All clusters consisted of five or more cases were associated
with different institutions with no overlapping epidemiological connections. The largest cluster

contained 35 cases linked by COVID-19 exposure in a single institution (Fig. 2b). With a single
exception, all clusters remained active during the study period (Fig. 1d).
The phylodynamics of the epidemic in NSW was also investigated (Fig. 3a), however,
genomic clusters were sampled for a limited period (maximum 19 days) and displayed weak
temporal structure (R2=0.171). The tracking of cluster evolution over time will become
increasingly important to identify active clusters over a longer sampling period. The low
genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of this epidemic means that both genomic
and epidemiological data are needed to clearly define SARS-CoV-2 outbreak clusters.
Using genomics to cluster locally acquired cases with unknown epidemiological links.
Twenty-two (10.5%) of the 209 cases included in this study were epidemiologically classified
as ‘locally acquired – contact not identified’. Of these 22 cases, 15 (68%) were identified by
genomic surveillance as belonging to nine genomic clusters containing cases with known
epidemiological links (Fig. 2b). The remaining seven cases were found to be genomic
singletons, not clustering with genomes included in this analysis.
Agent-based model estimation of local transmission in Australia. In the agent-based model,
the COVID-19 pandemic spread in Australia was initiated by overseas passenger arrivals, with
some infections probabilistically generated in proportion to the average daily number of
incoming passengers at airports, and binomially distributed within a 50km radius of each
airport. Fig. 4a presents a network formed by community transmission chains produced by an
ABM run simulating the period corresponding to the time interval between week 6 and week
10 of the study, that is, the period preceding the introduction of major lockdown strategies. A
typical distribution of chain lengths is shown in Fig. 4.b, displaying similar trends in
distribution of the genomic cluster sizes. The average local transmissions (within HH and HC
contexts), obtained over ten simulation runs, amount to 18.6% (range 15.0-23.9%, with
standard deviation 2.9%) of all infections simulated over the 35-day period, increasing over
the weeks to 11.9% (range 8.0-14.7%, with std dev 1.9%) during the last week (week 10).
When community transmissions are considered within a wider scope of local government areas,
the average local transmissions (across HH, HC and SLA contexts) reach an upper bound of
34.9% (std dev 8.2%) of all infections, peaking during the last week at 24.4% (std dev 5.7%).
These fractions are also found to be in strong concordance with their counterparts defined
through the genomic cluster analysis (25.8% for all local transmissions, with 17.1–18.3%

during the final week) (Fig. 4c). As expected, only a proportion of inferred transmission chains
were detected by genome surveillance based on identified COVID-19 cases (Fig. 4b).

Discussion
This is the first report of the convergent application of SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance and
agent-based modelling to investigate the local transmission of COVD-19. Particular strengths
of this study were integration of high-resolution genomic data with local epidemiology data
and inferences made by agent-based modelling, providing context and confirmation for the
genomic results and clustering. Our prospective SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing has been
instrumental in not only defining local transmission events and clusters, but enabling 68% of
the cases for which no epidemiological links had been identified to be assigned to known
epidemiological clusters, thereby allowing more efficient public health follow-up. The fine
scale resolution provided by the genomic analyses presented in this study will become
increasingly important for the containment of local outbreaks by enabling identification of
secondary cases and providing context for cases of community transmission without clear
epidemiological links20.
The high diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in Australia can be explained by multiple recent,
concurrent and independent introductions of COVID-19 from countries with a high frequency
of local transmission of COVID-19, such as Asia, Western Europe and North America. The
decision to close the Australian border to all except Australian citizens, residents and
immediate family members was announced on March 20th. Our phylogenetic analysis of unique
sequences suggested or confirmed the country of origin for some cases and identified
genomically clustered cases often associated with epidemiologically linked cases (Fig. 1b).
This analysis documented genomically similar cases associated with concurrent communitybased transmission in several institutions within the first ten weeks of the epidemic in Australia.
However, it was not possible to infer a directionality of virus spread during these early stages
of the epidemic as the rate of virus transmission is evidently greater than the rate of
evolutionary change in the virus genome16. Our genomic data have also confirmed the
dominance of overseas acquired infections in these early stages of the epidemic in Australia
despite initial border control measures.
This observation based on the first ten weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic warrants
further data collection in order to capture the impact of border control and social distancing
measures introduced during the time of this study. The timing of this study, unfortunately, was

also too short to delineate active (i.e. with continuing onward transmission) and inactive
clusters. Although the genomic surveillance results are based on a relatively small number of
COVID-19 cases in one Australian state, they offer a high-resolution picture of virus spread in
the community and the concordance of results from genomic surveillance and agent modelling
reinforces our conclusions.
This study leveraged the high resolution of inferences offered by agent-based infectious
disease models in contrast to the simulation of the population-level dynamics models which
have been typically employed for public health policy decisions. When such models are forced
to rely on incomplete and inconsistent data, as is the case for the COVID-19 pandemic, they
may suggest divergent outcomes, hence affecting public confidence in policy directions. The
agent-based models capture interactions of individuals in time and space using government
census data and detailed transmission pathways. The convergent estimates of local
transmission from the computational model and genome sequencing not only validated
COVID-19 modelling predictions but also suggested that our sampling of COVID-19 cases
have been adequate for discovery and monitoring local transmission events in the time of cocirculation of genomically similar strains of SARS-CoV-2.
Our findings extend the value of genomic surveillance in depicting transmission
pathways and evolution of emerging pathogens13,21,22. They also improve our understanding
and support the implementation of genomically enhanced surveillance for more efficient
COVID-19 control strategies and the investigation of cases with unclear infection sources and
within a short turn-around-time 16,17,21,22. The initial delay of 21 days between date of collection
and sequencing for the first three samples received included the time taken to establish the inhouse amplicon-based WGS method used in this study. The power of such surveillance is
augmented by international sharing of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data collected by researchers and
public health microbiology service providers23,24. Our clinical specimens originated from a
mixture of private and public pathology providers, thus our sample likely represented a general
population with a spectrum of clinical disease. We relied on an average sequence depth greater
than 200 to ensure quality of short read mapping and genome comparisons in line with previous
reports20,25, although further optimisation of may be required for sustainable and cost-effective
SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.
In conclusion, this genomic survey of SARS-CoV-2 in a subpopulation of infected
patients in the first ten weeks of COVID-19 activity in Australia enabled proactive monitoring
of local transmission events in the critical time of implementation of national COVID-19
control measures. Only a quarter of cases appeared to be locally acquired and genomics-derived

local transmission rates were concordant with predictions from the computational agent-based
model. This convergent assessment improves our understanding of the COVID-19 evolution
from outbreak to epidemic. Integrated analysis of outputs from SARS-CoV-2 genomic
surveillance and computational models can refine our understanding of the evolution of
COVID-19 epidemic and will be equally relevant for assessment of other emerging pathogens
that public health is going to face in the future. Moving forward, in order to contain SARS
CoV-2 in a relatively low-burden setting such as Australia, application of this high resolution
genomic analysis will be crucial to track, trace and place cases in context to ensure targeted
and informed public health action.

Methods
Samples for genomic surveillance. All clinical respiratory samples collected between January
21st and March 25th, 2020, which tested positive by real time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 at the Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research (ICPMR)
were included in the study. The RT-PCR assay utilised WHO recommended primers and
probes targeting regions in the E gene and RdRp domain (20). Samples were submitted directly
to ICPMR for RT-PCR testing and also referred from other NSW Health Pathology and private
pathology laboratories for genome sequencing. Genome sequencing was attempted on all PCR
positive samples with a RT-PCR Ct value <30.
Epidemiological data and case definitions. Public health follow-up was conducted in parallel
for each COVID-19 case. Travel histories were collected and used to determine whether
infections were acquired locally or overseas. The origin and number of confirmed COVID-19
cases detected in NSW during the study period were publicly available and obtained from the
NSW Health website26.
An imported case was defined as a person who tested SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive
and reported international travel in the 14 days before the onset of illness. A locally acquired
case was a person who tested SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive and had not travelled outside of
Australia in the 14 days before illness onset. Locally acquired cases were further classified on
epidemiological grounds as confirmed contacts of a case, as part of a known cluster, or of
unknown origin (i.e. no known contact with a case). Close contacts were defined as individuals
who had been in the same closed space for at least two hours with a laboratory-confirmed case
(i.e. someone who tested positive for COVID-19) when that person was infectious27.
The decision to close the Australian border to all except Australian citizens, residents
and immediate family members was announced on March 20th. Stage 1 and 2 restrictions were
implemented on March 23rd and 26th respectively. Stage 1 restrictions included closure of all
restaurants, gymnasiums, cinemas and places of worship, as well as avoiding non-essential
travel, outdoor gatherings of >500 and indoor gatherings of >100 people. Stage 2 restrictions
were an extension of Stage 1 and included advising the public to stay at home unless going to
work or education, shopping for essential supplies, undertaking personal exercise or attending
medical appointments or compassionate visits28.
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing. We undertook SARS-CoV-2 WGS using an existing
amplicon-based Illumina sequencing approach29,30. Briefly, RT-PCR positive samples were

reverse transcribed using SuperScript IV VILO MasterMix (ThermoFisher Scientific). The
viral cDNA was used as input for multiple overlapping PCR reactions (~2.5kb each) that
spanned the viral genome using Platinum SuperFi MasterMix. Amplicons were then pooled
equally, purified and quantified before Nextera XT library preparation and multiplex
sequencing on an Illumina iSeq or MiniSeq (150 cycle flow cell)31. All consensus SARS-CoV2 genomes identified in the study have been uploaded to GISAID (Supplement Table S1).
SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis. The raw sequence data was subjected to an in-house quality
control procedure prior to further analysis. Demultiplexed reads were quality trimmed using
Trimmomatic (sliding window of 4, minimum read quality score of 20, leading/trailing quality
of 5)32. The taxonomic identification of the sample was verified using centrifuge version 1.0.4,
based on a database compiled from human, prokaryotes and viral sequences (including SARsCoV-2 Refseq sequences available prior to March 2020)33. All samples had > 99% assignment
to genus ‘betacoronavirus’. Reference mapping and consensus calling was performed using
iVar version 1.229. Briefly, reads were mapped to the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome (NCBI
GenBank accession MN908947) using BWA-mem version 0.7.17, with unmapped reads
discarded. iVar trim was used to soft-clip reads containing primer sequences, and discard reads
<20 length discarded following trimming. A consensus sequence was called for positions
where depth >10, quality >20 with a minimum frequency threshold of 0.1. The 5’ and 3’ UTR
regions were masked from the consensus due to poor quality of these regions. QUAST version
5.0.2 was used to evaluate the consensus sequence quality in addition to manual inspection in
Geneious Prime (2020.0.5)34. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from NSW were compared with one
another as well as with complete, or near complete, global genomes available at GISAID
(www.gisaid.org: accessed 28th March 2020, see Supplementary Table S2 for complete list of
international genomes used in this study). The quality of GISAID genomes was evaluated using
QUAST, with sequences retained only if they were >28,000-bp in length and contained <0.05%
missing bases (n=1,985 reference genomes). The GISAID and NSW genomes were aligned
with MAFFT v7.402 (FFT-NS-2, progressive method)35. Genomes were trimmed to remove 5’
and 3’ untranslated regions. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the maximum
likelihood approach (IQTree v1.6.7 (substitution model: GTR+F+R2) with 1,000 bootstrap
replicates36. SARS-CoV-2 genomic lineages were inferred using Phylogenetic Assignment of
Named Global Outbreak LINeages (PANGOLIN) (https://github.com/hCoV-2019/pangolin).
Total SNP numbers between the index SARS-CoV-2 genome from NSW (GISAID Accession:
NSW01/EPI-ISL-407893) and each genome in the study was calculated using SNP-sites

(excluding ambiguities)37. Temporal structure and distribution of genomic clusters in NSW
was visualised using Treetime38. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using R package ggtree39.
Agent-based model. We used an agent-based model (ABM) developed to trace the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic in Australia40. This model has been specifically calibrated to reproduce
several key characteristics of COVID-19 transmission in Australia, including its reproductive
number (R0 = 2.27), the length of incubation and generation periods (5.0 and 6.4 days,
respectively), age-dependent fractions of the symptomatic cases (0.669 and 0.134, for adults
and children, respectively) and the probability of transmission from asymptomatic/presymptomatic agents (0.3 of symptomatic individuals). The ABM comprises approximately 24
million software agents, each with attributes of an anonymous individual, matching key
demographic statistics from the 2016 Australian Census data as well as other data from the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and
Reporting Authority (ACARA). Contact and transmission rates were set to differ across distinct
social contexts, such as households, household clusters, local neighbourhoods, schools,
classrooms and workplaces. The ABM simulation processes and updates agents’ states over
time, starting from initial infections, seeded in international airports around Australia, using
demographics and mobility layers previously developed and applied to trace influenza
pandemics41-42. Local transmissions were defined as links in the chains originated by all initial
infections detected within a given context, i.e., progressing through households (HH) and
household clusters (HC). In other words, transmissions occurring across the wider community
are not counted as local transmissions, but are still detected in order to investigate the overall
connectivity of emerging local “clusters”. Thus, each local transmission chain may include
links from several mixing contexts: HH, HC and wider neighbourhood, represented by
statistical local area (SLA) mapped to Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) in the 2016 census (SLAs
are Local Government Areas or part thereof). The COVID-19 model has been validated with
the most recent disease surveillance data, being able to predict both the incidence and
prevalence peaks in early to mid-April 202040.
Ethics statement. Clinical specimens were routinely processed at the Institute of Clinical
Pathology and Medical Research (ICPMR) and deemed not research. A non-research
determination for this project was granted by the Health Protection NSW as it was a designated
communicable disease control activity.

Figure 1. The timeline of COVID-19 cases and SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing in NSW.
(a) Weekly proportions of confirmed COVID-19 cases (grey) that underwent genome
sequencing (orange) during the study period. (b) Turn-around-time of genome sequencing
during the first phase of the epidemic. Shown are the date of collection (blue) and date of WGS
(orange) for each of the 209 samples included in this study. (c) Total counts and proportions of
imported (red) and locally acquired cases, both epi linked (orange) and of unknown source
(yellow) during the study period by epi week. (d) Timelines of genomically defined clusters.
Cluster number and number of cases (in brackets) are indicated next to bars (only clusters
containing five or more cases are shown). Colour gradient reflects proportion of overseas
acquired cases within the cluster, with darkest red representing 100% overseas acquired cases
and yellow representing zero overseas acquired cases in the cluster.

Figure 2. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Figure 2. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. (a) SARS-CoV-2 genomes from
Australia in the global context provided by GISAID. Australian SARS-CoV-2 genomes are
colour coded by the state of the initial diagnosis. The inner ring represents global phylogenetic
lineages inferred from the final alignment using PANGOLIN (https://github.com/hCoV2019/pangolin). Outer ring demonstrates the country of origin of GISAID genomes. (b)
Phylogenetic relationships between SARS-CoV-2 genomes recovered from patients in NSW.
The inner ring represents the allocation of clusters in NSW (only clusters equal or larger than
5 genomes are presented). Outer ring demonstrates the classification of cases as locally or
overseas acquired based on genomic and epidemiological data. Bootstrap data for Lineage
inference is presented in Supplemental Table S1.

Figure 4. Network of SARS-CoV transmission cases generated by the agent-based model.
(a) Network of transmission chains progressing through households (HH) and household
clusters (HC) to statistical local areas (SLA). Local transmissions were defined as chains
originated by these initial infections, and progressing through households and household
clusters and mixing into wider neighbourhood, represented by statistical local area. (b) A
typical distribution of chain lengths contrasted with sizes of genome sequencing defined
clusters. (c) Comparison of local transmission rates in NSW defined by SARS-CoV-2 genome
sequencing and simulated by the ABM model, averaged over ten simulation runs.
