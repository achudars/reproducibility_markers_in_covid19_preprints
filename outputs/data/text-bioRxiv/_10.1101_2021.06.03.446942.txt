SUMMARY

24

Replication-competent recombinant viruses expressing reporter genes

25

provide valuable tools to investigate viral infection. Low levels of reporter gene

26

expressed from previous reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 have jeopardized

27

their use to monitor the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro or in vivo.

28

Here, we report an alternative strategy where reporter genes were placed

29

upstream of the viral nucleocapsid gene followed by a 2A cleavage peptide.

30

The higher levels of reporter expression using this strategy resulted in efficient

31

visualization of rSARS-CoV-2 in infected cultured cells and K18 hACE2

32

transgenic mice. Importantly, real-time viral infection was readily tracked using

33

a non-invasive in vivo imaging system and allowed us to rapidly identify

34

antibodies which are able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Notably,

35

these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 retained wild-type virus like

36

pathogenicity in vivo, supporting their use to investigate viral infection,

37

dissemination, pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions for the treatment of

38

SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.

INTRODUCTION

46

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA

47

viruses that belong to the Coronaviridae family that can cause mild to severe

48

respiratory infections in humans (Hu et al., 2020). Two CoVs have been

49

associated with severe respiratory syndrome in the past two decades: Severe

50

Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2002-2003 and Middle East

51

Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) in 2012-present (De Wit et al., 2016).

52

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in

53

the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019 and is the causative agent of the

54

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (Lu et al., 2020; Wu et al.,

55

2020). As of June 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be responsible for

56

over 150 million human infection cases and more than 3 million deaths around

57

the World (https://covid19.who.int/).

58

Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 mainly replicates in the

59

upper (nasal turbinate) and lower (lungs) respiratory tract, resulting, in some

60

cases, in fatal respiratory illness (Li et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). However, the

61

intra-host dissemination and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 are not well

62

understood. Several animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been

63

established and have already provided very valuable information to

64

understand the mechanism of tissue and cell tropism, replication and

65

pathogenesis (Imai et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020; Oladunni et al., 2020; Singh

66

et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2020). However, assessing the presence of

67

SARS-CoV-2 in infected animals, organs or tissues has required collection and

68

processing of samples upon euthanasia, which complicates studies examining

69

the longitudinal dynamic of a viral infection within an infected host.

70

Recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes could overcome this

71

problem and allow tracking viral infection in vivo and in real time by monitoring

72

the expression of the reporter gene. We and others have documented the

73

feasibility of generating reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 using reverse

74

genetic system (Chiem et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2020a). These rSARS-CoV-2

75

have been genetically engineered to express the reporter gene by substituting

76

the viral open reading frame (ORF) 7a protein with the reporter gene of interest,

77

an experimental approach first employed to generate reporter-expressing

78

rSARS-CoV (Sims et al., 2005). Despite these reporter-expressing

79

rSARS-CoV-2 were showing comparable plaque phenotype, replication and

80

growth kinetics as those of wild-type virus (rSARS-CoV-2/WT) in vitro (Chiem

81

et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2020a; Xie et al., 2020b), it is unclear if the

82

reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 lacking ORF7a recapitulate viral

83

pathogenicity in vivo and whether reporter gene expression levels could be

84

efficiently tracked ex vivo using tissues or organs from infected animals, or in a

85

whole organism in vivo.

86

In this study, we cloned fluorescent (Venus) and luciferase (Nano luciferase,

87

Nluc) reporter genes upstream of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) gene

88

separated by the porcine tescherovirus (PTV-1) 2A proteolytic cleavage site to

89

generate new reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 without the deletion of the

90

ORF7a protein. In vitro, rSARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes from the viral

91

N locus replicated and made viral plaques similar to those of rSARS-CoV-2/WT.

92

Notably, reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 generated using this 2A strategy

93

expressed higher levels of reporter gene expression compared to those

94

rSARS-CoV-2 generated by substituting the viral ORF7a protein with the

95

reporter gene of interest. Importantly, rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A and

96

rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A showed rSARS-CoV-2/WT-like pathogenicity in vivo.

97

Notably, the higher level of Venus expression from rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A

98

allowed us to detect viral infection in the lungs of infected K18 human

99

angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice using an in vivo

100

imaging system (IVIS). Moreover, Venus expression from

101

rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A was stable up to seven passages in vitro in cultured

102

Vero E6 cells and in vivo up to day 6 post-infection. Importantly, levels of

103

Venus expression correlated well with viral titers detected in the lungs,

104

demonstrating the feasibility of using Venus expression as a valid surrogate

105

marker to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A, we

106

were able to track the dynamics of viral infection in real time and longitudinally

107

assess SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Finally, we testified the feasibility of

108

using the rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A to rapidly and accurately identify antibodies

109

that neutralize viral infection in vivo.

110

Our data demonstrate that these next-generation of rSARS-CoV-2

111

expressing reporter genes we have generated can be used to easily monitor

112

viral infection in cultured cells and in validated animal models of infection.

113

Importantly, our new rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A or rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A retain

114

similar virulence to that of rSARS-CoV-2/WT in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice

115

and can be used to investigate viral replication, tropism and viral dissemination

116

and pathogenesis in vivo and to rapidly identify therapeutics for the treatment

117

of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 disease.

RESULTS

134

Generation of rSARS-CoV-2 expressing Venus

135

We have recently described the generation and characterization of

136

rSARS-CoV-2 where a reporter gene of interest replaced the viral ORF7a

137

protein (Chiem et al., 2021). However, these rSARS-CoV-2 showed low levels

138

of reporter gene expression during viral infection. To increase expression

139

levels of reporter gene during SARS-CoV-2 infection and avoid the deletion of

140

ORF7a protein, we implemented a strategy we previously used to generate

141

recombinant influenza viruses and mammarenaviruses (Nogales et al., 2019;

142

Ye et al., 2020b). In this approach, the sequences of the reporter Venus

143

fluorescent protein and the porcine teschovirus 1 (PTV-1) 2A self-cleaving

144

peptide (Caì et al., 2018) were cloned upstream of the SARS-CoV-2 N gene

145

(Fig. 1A), and the sequences harboring the fusion Venus-2A-N were cloned

146

into the previously described bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing

147

the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome (Chiem et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020a). We

148

rescued rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A virus according to our previously described

149

protocol (Chiem et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020a). Vero E6 cells infected with the

150

tissue culture supernatant from Vero E6 cells transfected with the BAC

151

containing the viral genome of rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A resulted in the

152

expression of Venus in the same cells expressing the viral N protein (Fig. 1B).

153

Venus was readily detected in whole cell lysate from rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A-,

154

but not rSARS-CoV-2/WT-infected Vero E6 cells, while the viral N protein was

155

detected in lysate obtained from both rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A- and

156

rSARS-CoV-2/WT-infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1C). We confirmed the genetic

157

identity of rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A using reverse-transcription polymerase

158

chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplify the Venus sequence and the entire

159

sequence between ORF8 and N. The Venus fragment was amplified from cells

160

infected with rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A, while the fragment between ORF8 and

161

N was detected in cells infected with either rSARS-CoV-2/WT or

162

rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A. As predicted, the amplified fragment from

163

rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A infected cells had a higher molecular size than the

164

one obtained from rSARS-CoV-2/WT-infected cells (Fig. 1D).

165

In vitro characterization of rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A

166

We next assessed the fitness of rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A in Vero E6 cells

167

by evaluating its growth kinetics, plaque phenotype, and reporter expression

168

and compared them to our previously described rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Venus and

169

rSARS-CoV-2/WT. rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A showed similar growth kinetics to

170

those of rSARS-CoV-2/WT or rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Venus (Fig. 2A). Likewise,

171

rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A, rSARS-CoV-2/WT and rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Venus

172

exhibited similar plaque phenotypes (Fig. 2B). Notably, plaques formed by

173

rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A, but not those of rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Venus, could be

174

readily detected using a fluorescent imaging system, most likely because of

175

the higher levels of Venus expressed from the locus of the viral N than those

176

from the locus of the viral ORF7a (Fig. 2B). We next examined Venus

177

expression in Vero E6 cells infected (MOI 0.001) with either

178

rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A or rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Venus. Both infections showed

179

peak Venus expression at 48 h post-infection (hpi), but Venus expression

180

levels from rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A infected Vero E6 cells were higher than

181

those infected with rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Venus (Fig. 2C). To confirm this, we

182

prepared whole cell lysates from Mock, rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A and

183

rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Venus infected Vero E6 cells and analyzed them by

184

Western blot. Venus expression levels in rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A infected

185

Vero E6 cells were greater than those of rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Venus infected

186

cells at all time points, whereas expression levels of N protein were

187

comparable at all time points in Vero E6 cells infected with

188

rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A and rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Venus (Fig. 2D).

189

In vivo characterization of rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A

190

K18 transgenic mice expressing hACE2 have been shown to be a good

191

animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Oladunni et al., 2020; Zheng et al.,

192

2021). We therefore examined whether SARS-CoV-2 infection could be

193

tracked ex vivo using Venus expression. To that end, K18 hACE2 transgenic

194

mice were infected intranasally with 105 PFU of rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A,

195

rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Venus or rSARS-CoV-2/WT (Fig. 3). Mice were euthanized

196

at 1, 2, 4 and 6 days post-infection (dpi), and their lungs were excised and

197

imaged ex vivo using an in vivo imaging system (AMI spectrum). Venus

198

expression was readily detected in all lungs obtained from mice infected with

199

rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A but not those infected with rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Venus,

200

or rSARS-CoV-2/WT (Fig. 3A). Quantitative analyses showed that Venus

201

intensity peaks at 2 dpi and decreases over the course of infection in the lungs

202

of infected mice (Fig. 3B). Nevertheless, gross lesions on the lung surface of

203

mice infected with rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A was comparable to those observed

204

in rSARS-CoV-2/WT or rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Venus infected mice (Fig. 3C and

205

3D). In addition, infection with rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A and

206

rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Venus resulted in comparable viral titers to those observed

207

in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice infected with rASRS-CoV-2/WT in all organs at

208

all times pi (Fig. 3E), suggesting that the undetectable Venus expression in the

209

lungs of K18 hACE2 mice infected with rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Venus is unlikely

210

due to lower levels of viral replication in vivo. Notably, we observed a

211

correlation between virus replication and fluorescence intensity in the lungs

212

(Fig. 3F).

213

To investigate the pathogenicity of rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A, we infected

214

(105 PFU) K18 hACE2 transgenic mice intranasally with

215

rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A, rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Venus or rSARS-CoV-2/WT, and

216

monitored changes in body weight and survival rate for 12 days after viral

217

infection. All infected mice showed significant bodyweight loss starting from 4

218

dpi. Mice infected with rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Venus succumbed to viral infection

219

by 8 dpi and mice infected with rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A or rSARS-CoV-2/WT

220

succumbed to infection by 9 dpi (Fig. 3G and 3H).

221

In vitro and in vivo stability of rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A

222

Because reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 applications necessitate

223

genetic and phenotypic stability, we evaluated the stability of

224

rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A in vitro and in vivo. To that end, we passaged the

225

rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A seven times in Vero E6 cells and tissue culture

226

supernatant (TCS) from selected passages were subjected to the analysis of

227

plaque assay using a fluorescent imaging system and immunostaining with the

228

1C7C7 N protein monoclonal antibody (MAb) (Fig. 4A, left). Viruses present in

229

TCS from P1, P3, P5 and P7 retained 100% Venus expression (Fig. 4A, right).

230

For the in vivo stability evaluation of rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A, lung

231

homogenates from K18 hACE2 transgenic mice at 1, 2, 4 and 6 dpi infected

232

with rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A were subjected to plaque assay using a

233

fluorescent imaging system and immunostaining with the 1C7C7 N protein

234

MAb (Fig. 4B, left). Lung homogenates from 1 and 2 dpi retained 100% Venus

235

expression, and homogenates from 4 and 6 dpi retained 99% and 98%,

236

respectively, Venus expression (Fig. 4B, right).

237

Visualization of SARS-CoV-2 replication dynamic in vivo

238

While fluorescent Venus expression allowed us to conduct ex vivo imaging

239

of lungs from SARS-CoV-2 infected mice, it did not allow us to track viral

240

infection in the entire mouse using IVIS. To circumvent this problem, we

241

engineered a Nluc-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 using our reverse genetic system

242

and the same 2A strategy (Fig. 5A). This rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A exhibited a

11

243

similar plaque phenotype and comparable growth kinetics in Vero E6 cells as

244

the rSARS-CoV-2/WT and our previously described rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Nluc

245

(Fig. 5B and 5C). Notably, Nluc expression levels were increased by more

246

than 30-folds in Vero E6 cells infected with rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A than

247

rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Nluc at 72 hpi (Fig. 5D).

248

Since the rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A expressed significantly higher levels of

249

Nluc than those of our previously described rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Nluc in vitro,

250

we evaluated whether SARS-CoV-2 infection could be tracked in vivo using

251

Nluc expression directed by rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A. To that end, we infected

252

(105 PFU) K18 hACE2 transgenic mice intranasally with rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A

253

or rSARS-CoV-2/WT (Fig. 6). Mice were anesthetized, retro-orbitally injected

254

with Nluc substrate and then imaged under an IVIS at 1, 2, 4 and 6 dpi. Nluc

255

expression was readily detected in mice infected with rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A

256

but not those infected with rSARS-CoV-2/WT (Fig. 6A), as previously shown in

257

vitro (Fig. 5D). Quantitative analyses showed that Nluc intensity continued

258

increasing at later dpi (Fig. 6B). Gross lesions on the lung surface of mice

259

infected with rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A was comparable to those in the WT

260

rSARS-CoV-2 infected mice (Fig. 6C and 6D). Importantly, viral titers detected

261

in the rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A infected mice were comparable to those infected

262

with rSARS-CoV-2/WT in all organs tested at different dpi (Fig. 6E), despite

263

the Nluc activity was only detected in the organs from rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A

264

virus infected mice (Fig. 6F). Unexpectedly, the Nluc intensity did not correlate

12

265

with the viral titers in the lungs at 4 and 6 dpi (Fig. 6G), indicating the Nluc

266

accumulates in vivo. Meanwhile, we also compared the pathogenicity of

267

rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A and rSARS-CoV-2/WT in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice.

268

Both rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A and rSARS-CoV-2/WT showed similar virulence

269

(Figs. 6H and 6I).

270

Effect of NAbs on progression of Nluc-2A virus infection in vivo

271

Although several vaccines against COVID-19 have been already approved

272

for emergency use by United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA),

273

identification and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs represent a valuable

274

therapeutic option to counteract the putative emergence of variants of concern

275

(VoC). Currently, most NAb screenings are performed in tissue cultured cells

276

rather than in vivo, which is heavily reliant upon viral titration of animal organs,

277

a process that is time and labor intensive. We therefore investigated whether

278

the use of rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A could expedite the screening process and

279

facilitate the investigation of how NAb affects the kinetics of virus infection. To

280

that end, we treated K18 hACE2 transgenic prophylactically with 1212C2, a

281

previously described SARS-CoV-2 NAb (Piepenbrink et al., 2021), for 12 h,

282

and then infected them (105 PFU) with rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A. Non-invasive

283

longitudinal imaging of the mice revealed that 1212C2 treated mice

284

dramatically restricted rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A multiplication since no significant

285

Nluc signal was detected at any time point examined (Figs. 7A and 7B). These

286

DISCUSSION

310

In this study, we report a novel strategy to generate replication competent

311

reporter-expressing (e.g., Venus or Nluc) rSARS-CoV-2 using the

312

well-documented BAC-based reverse genetic system (Ye et al., 2020a). Our

313

rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A and rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A both exhibited

314

rSARS-CoV-2/WT-like growth properties in vitro and in vivo without displaying

315

attenuation and allowed us to monitor virus infection ex vivo in the lungs of

316

infected mice (rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A) and the dynamics of viral replication in

317

the entire mouse (rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A) using non-invasive longitudinal in

318

vivo imaging. Importantly, we demonstrate the feasibility of using

319

rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A to rapidly identify prophylactics and/or therapeutics in

320

vivo.

321

We and others have previously demonstrated the feasibility of using this 2A

322

approach to generate recombinant viruses expressing reporter genes fused to

323

a viral protein (Caì et al., 2018; Manicassamy et al., 2010; Nogales et al., 2019;

324

Ye et al., 2020b). To generate these novel reporter rSARS-CoV-2 expressing

325

higher level of reporter gene, we placed the PTV-1 2A self-cleaving peptide

326

between the reporter gene and the viral N gene (Fig. 1). This results in the

327

expression of a polyprotein that is post-translationally cleaved at the 2A site

328

leading to the individual expression of the reporter gene and the viral N protein

329

(Luke et al., 2010), and the expression of Venus in rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A

330

was extremely increased in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 2 and 3, respectively). The

15

331

rationale of cloning the reporter gene fused to the viral N gene to increase

332

reporter gene expression was based on the N protein being one of the most

333

abundant structural proteins produced during SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs

334

infections (Hiscox et al., 1995; Hou et al., 2020; Scobey et al., 2013).

335

Importantly, this new 2A approach does not remove any viral gene from the

336

viral genome. Although recent data from our laboratory (Silvas et al., 2021)

337

suggest that ORF7a is not essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and in

338

vivo, it is still largely unknown whether the lack of ORF7a affects some

339

unknown aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infections. In addition, this also increases

340

the instability concern of reporter gene, as shown in a recent study where a

341

reporter gene fused into the C-terminus of ORF7a was not stable (Rihn et al.,

342

2021). Contrarily, our rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A exhibited 100% stability after

343

seven passages in cultured cells and retained 98% stability in vivo at 6 dpi (Fig.

344

4).

345

The increased expression level of reporter gene also facilitates the use of

346

bioluminescence imaging of the entire infected mouse. rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A

347

expressed ~30 folds higher levels of Nluc than rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Nluc in

348

cultured cells (Fig. 5), which allowed us to track the viral infection as early as 1

349

dpi (Fig. 6A). Another advantage is that the rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A could

350

provide a real-time and longitudinal information in a non-invasive manner of

351

infection rather than providing a static “snapshot” using the traditional

352

necropsy and titration of tissues or organs from infected animal. Notably, Nluc

16

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.03.446942; this version posted June 4, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

353

activity correlated well with the titers detected in the lungs at 1 and 2 dpi (Figs.

354

6E and 6F). However, viral titers in lungs were decreased at 4 and 6 dpi,

355

whereas we still detected high levels of Nluc activity. This may reflect Nluc

356

stability (Hall et al., 2012), which may lead to the accumulation and gradual

357

increase of Nluc signal during the course of viral infection. This explanation

358

was also supported by the in vitro infection data in which the viral titers were

359

declining yet and the Nluc activity was gradually increasing (Fig. 5D).

360

NAb represent a promising prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment

361

against SARS-CoV-2, particularly for individuals infected with newly identified

362

VoC. However, evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 NAb in vivo relies on the necropsy

363

and viral titration of tissues and/or organs from infected animals. To overcome

364

this limitation, we established a rapid method based on a non-invasive

365

measurement of Nluc expression. By using this in vivo imaging system, NAbs

366

could be easily identified as early as 1 dpi and in a relative high throughput

367

method. This was further supported by Nluc activity, viral titration, body weight

368

changes and survival rate (Fig. 7), indicating our strategy provides a rapid in

369

vivo screening method to identify NAbs against SARS-CoV-2.

370

In the present work, we have documented a new strategy to generate

371

replication-competent reporter rSARS-CoV-2 expressing higher levels of

372

reporter gene than those previously described by substituting the viral ORF7a

373

protein with the report gene. This novel strategy does not eliminate any viral

374

gene and these new reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 were genetically stable

375

and replicated as efficiently as rSARS-CoV-2/WT both in vitro and in vivo, with

376

comparable pathogenicity in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice. Notably, the robust

377

levels of reporter gene expression of these new reporter-expressing

378

rSARS-CoV-2 represent an excellent option to study viral pathogenesis, tissue

379

tropism, and replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2, including recently identified

380

VoC.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

399

Biosafety

400

All the in vitro and in vivo experiments with infectious rSARS-CoV-2 were

401

conducted under appropriate biosafety level (BSL) 3 and animal BSL3 (ABSL3)

402

laboratories, respectively, at Texas Biomedical Research Institute (Texas

403

Biomed). Experiments were approved by the Texas Biomed Institutional

404

Biosafety (IBC) and Animal Care and Use (IACUC) committees.

405

Cells and viruses

406

African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero E6, CRL-1586) were

407

obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Bethesda, MD)

408

and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented

409

with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, VWR) and 1%

410

penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (PSG) solution (Corning).

411

Recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 were generated based on the backbone of

412

the USA-WA1/2020 strain using a previously described bacterial artificial

413

chromosome (BAC)-based reverse genetics system (Chiem et al., 2020; Ye et

414

al., 2020a).

415

Rescue of rSARS-CoV-2

416

Virus rescue experiments were performed as previously described

417

(Avila-Perez et al., 2019). Briefly, confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells (106

418

cells/well, 6-well plates, triplicates) were transfected with 4.0 μg/well of

419

SARS-CoV-2 BAC using Lipofectamine 2000. After 24 h, transfection media

420

was exchanged for post-infection media (DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS

421

and 1% PSG), and cells were split and seeded into T75 flasks 72 h

422

post-transfection. After incubation for another 72 h, tissue culture supernatants

423

were collected, labeled as P0 and stored at -80°C. After being titrated, the P0

424

virus was used to infect fresh Vero E6 cells at MOI 0.0001 for 72 h to generate

425

P1 stocks. P1 viral stocks were aliquoted and stored at -80°C until being used.

426

Western blot

427

Whole cell lysates, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting were performed as

428

previously described (Ye et al., 2020b). Briefly, cells were lysed in passive lysis

429

buffer (Promega, MI, USA) at 4°C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at

430

12,000 g at 4°C for another 30 min. Equivalent amounts of cell lysates were

431

subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.

432

After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.1% Tween

433

20 at room temperature for 1 h, the membranes were incubated with the

434

indicated primary antibodies at 4°C overnight, followed by horseradish

435

peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody incubation at 37°C for 1 h. β-Actin

436

was used as the loading control. Membranes were developed with ECL

437

detection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the ChemiDoc MP Imaging

438

System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

441

mock-inoculated or inoculated with the tissue culture supernatant (1 ml/well) of

442

Vero E6 cells transfected with the BACs collected at 72 h post-transfection. At

443

48 h post-inoculation, cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde solution at 4°C

444

overnight and permeabilized using 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at

445

room temperature. Then, cells were incubated overnight with 1 μg/ml of a

446

SARS-CoV cross-reactive N MAb (1C7C7) at 4°C, washed stringently with

447

PBS, and stained with a FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200). Finally,

448

cells were visualized and imaged under a EVOS fluorescent microscope

449

(Thermo Fisher Scientific).

450

RT-PCR

451

Total RNA from virus infected (MOI=0.01) Vero E6 cells (106 cells/well,

452

6-well plate format) was extracted with TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher

453

Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR amplification

454

of the viral genome spanning nucleotides 27,895-29,534 (according to the

455

SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 viral genome) was performed using Super Script

456

II Reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Expanded High Fidelity

457

PCR System (Sigma Aldrich). The amplified DNA products were separated on

458

a 0.7% agarose gel. All primer sequences used for RT-PCR are available upon

459

request.

460

Plaque assay and immunostaining

461

Confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells (106 cells/well, 6-well plate format,

462

triplicates) were infected with serial viral dilutions for 1 h at 37°C. After viral

463

adsorption, cells were overlaid with pi media containing 1% low melting agar

464

and incubated at 37°C. At 72 hpi, cells were fixed overnight with 10%

465

formaldehyde solution. For visualization of Venus, plates were photographed

466

under a ChemiDoc MP Imaging System. For immunostaining, cells were

467

permeabilized with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room

468

temperature and immunostained using the SARS-CoV cross-reactive N

469

protein 1C7C7 MAb (1 μg/ml) and the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories),

470

following the manufacturers’ instruction. After immunostaining, plates were

471

scanned and photographed using a ChemiDoc MP Imaging System.

472

Virus growth kinetics

473

Confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells (6-well format, 106 cells/well,

474

triplicates) were mock infected or infected (MOI=0.01) with rSARS-CoV-2/WT,

475

rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Venus, rSARS-CoV-2/Venus-2A or rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A.

476

After 1 h of virus adsorption at 37°C, cells were washed with chilled PBS and

477

overlaid with 3 ml of pi medium and incubated at 37°C. At the indicated times

478

pi (12, 24, 48 and 72 h), viral titers in the tissue culture supernatants were

479

determined by plaque assay (Nogales et al., 2014). Presence of Nluc in the

480

tissue culture supernatants from mock and rSARS-CoV-2/WT,

481

rSARS-CoV-2/Δ7a-Nluc or rSARS-CoV-2/Nluc-2A infected cells was quantified

482

using Nano-Glo® Luciferase Assay System (Promega) following the

483

manufacturers’ specification.

485

All animal protocols were approved by Texas Biomed IACUC (1718MU).

486

Five-week-old female K18 hACE2 transgenic mice were purchased from The

487

Jackson Laboratory and maintained in the animal facility at Texas Biomed

488

under specific pathogen-free conditions. For virus infection, mice were

489

anesthetized following gaseous sedation in an isoflurane chamber and

490

inoculated intranasally with a dose of 105 PFU/mouse.

491

For ex vivo imaging of lungs, mice were humanely euthanized at 1, 2, 4

492

and 6 dpi to collect lungs. Fluorescent images of lungs were photographed

493

using an in vivo imaging system (AMI HTX) and the bright field images of lungs

494

were taken using an iPhone 6s (Apple, CA, USA). Nasal turbinate, lungs and

495

brains from mock or infected animals were homogenized in 1 ml of PBS for 20

496

s at 7,000 rpm using a Precellys tissue homogenizer (Bertin Instruments,

497

Yvelines, France). Tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 g (4 °C) for

498

5 min, and supernatants were collected and titrated by plaque assay and

499

immunostaining as previously described.

500

For in vivo bioluminescence imaging, mice were anesthetized with

501

isoflurane, injected retro-orbitally with 100 μl of Nano-Glo luciferase substrate

502

(Promega), and immediately imaged. The bioluminescence data acquisition

503

and analysis were performed using the Aura program (AMI spectrum). Flux

504

measurements were acquired from the region of interest. The scale used is

505

included in each figure. Immediately after imaging, nasal turbinate, lungs, and

506

brains were collected and homogenized in 1 ml of PBS. Supernatants were

507

collected and presence of virus was determined by plaque assay and

508

immunostaining, as described above. Nluc activity in the tissue culture

509

supernatants was determined under a multiplate reader (BioTek Instruments,

510

Inc) as above.

511

For the body weight and survival studies, five-week-old female K18

512

hACE2 transgenic mice were infected intranasally with 105 PFU/animal

513

following gaseous sedation in an isoflurane chamber. After infection, mice

514

were monitored daily for morbidity (body weight) and mortality (survival rate)

515

for 12 days. Mice showing a loss of more than 25% of their initial body weight

516

were defined as reaching the experimental end-point and humanely

517

euthanized, and the survival curves were plotted according to the method of

518

Kaplan-Meier (Efron, 1988).

519

Statistical analysis

520

All data is presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for each group

521

and analyzed by SPSS13.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). A P value of less than

522

0.05 (P<0.05) was considered statistically significant.
