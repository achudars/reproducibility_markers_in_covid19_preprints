Abstract
Although a defective vitamin D pathway has been widely suspected to be associated
in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, the status of the vitamin D pathway and vitamin D-modulated
genes in lung cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. To understand
the significance of the vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, computational
approaches were applied to transcriptomic datasets from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
(BALF) cells of such patients or healthy individuals. Levels of vitamin D receptor, retinoid X
receptor, and CYP27A1 in BALF cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were found to
be reduced. Additionally, 107 differentially expressed, predominantly downregulated genes
modulated by vitamin D were identified in transcriptomic datasets from patient’s cells.
Further analysis of differentially expressed genes provided eight novel genes with a
conserved motif with vitamin D-responsive elements, implying the role of both direct and
indirect mechanisms of gene expression by the dysregulated vitamin D pathway in SARSCoV-2-infected cells. Network analysis of differentially expressed vitamin D-modulated
genes identified pathways in the immune system, NF-kB/cytokine signaling, and cell cycle
regulation as top predicted pathways that might be affected in the cells of such patients. In
brief, the results provided computational evidence to implicate a dysregulated vitamin D
pathway in the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction
Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to be a major global public health crisis
and has caused 1,605,091 mortalities as of January 9, 20211. Scientifically validated medicine
and/or vaccine that might be suitable for the society at-large are about to be made available.
Simultaneously, the scientific community is being largely guided by the epidemiological,
symptomatic, socioeconomic, and population variabilities, and predictive disease models for
understanding the cellular basis of infectivity and emerging patterns of the pandemic. This
includes the studies of reinfection and/or coinfection with other viruses and formulation of
counter measures to minimize the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection2–4. Several recent
studies have provided clues about the nature of cellular pathways that might be responsible
for the evident population variability in terms of susceptibility, exhibition of symptoms,
severity, progression of the disease, and recovery from the infection5,6. This process is further
benefitted by applying the lessons gained from the interactions between the human cells and
other single-stranded RNA viruses in hosts such as those causing influenza, hepatitis, Ebola,
and AIDS.
One of the correlations that has recently gained scientific attention is the correlation
between vitamin D deficiency and SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is partly because of the role
of vitamin D in cellular phenotypes, including immunity modification and inflammation, and
its ability to influence the endothelial cell biology and the functionality of ACE2, one of the
major receptors for SARS-CoV-27–9. Although correlative studies between vitamin D
pathway and SARS-CoV-2 continue to provide positive clues about the significance of
vitamin D in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, the expression status of core components of the
vitamin D pathway, and hence, the functionality of the pathway in patients infected with
SARS-CoV-2 remain unknown.

Vitamin D is one of the most studied steroid hormones with various cellular functions.
The precursor vitamin D3 is generated from 7-hydrocholestetol by a nonenzymatic reaction
catalyzed by ultraviolet B radiation. In the liver, vitamin D3 is modified to 25-hydroxy
vitamin D and further to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) in kidneys as well as in other
organ systems in the presence of CYP27B1 enzyme. Cellular effects of vitamin D result from
its nongenomic or cytoplasmic effects and/or genomic nuclear effects. They are caused by
1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) or retinoid X receptor
(RXR) complex within specific responsive DNA sequences in the target genes or through
indirect mechanisms9. In addition to the status of vitamin D3/cholecalciferol, biosynthesis of
1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D is positively and negatively modulated by alpha-hydroxylases
CYP27B1 and CYP24A1, respectively. Interestingly, these enzymes are under the control of
fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a paracrine growth factor expressed in the lung, heart,
and kidney10. Increased systemic levels of FGF23 are generally associated with general
inflammation, cardiac hypertrophy, chronic kidney disease, and inflammation in lung
airway11; all these phenotypes are found to be closely associated in SARS-CoV-2
pathogenesis. In general, FGF23 acts through its receptors, FGFR1–4, in its coreceptor
klotho-dependent or -independent manner. Other activities of FGF23 relevant to SARS-CoV2 are as follows: participation in cardiac myocytes in stimulating the levels of fibrotic factors,
cardiac fibrosis, and pathological cardiac remodeling12; induction of proinflammatory
cytokine IL-1beta11; inhibition of ACE2 expression, angiotensin II (Ang II) induction, and
blood pressure in kidney13; and inhibition of M1 to M2 transitioning of macrophage and
counteracting anti-inflammation response14. Additionally, FGF23 and CYP24A1 are
components of a regulatory vitamin D feedback loop because both molecules are genomic
targets of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and are stimulated by it in a VDR-dependent
manner11,15,16. In addition to vitamin D, FGF23 levels have been shown to be induced by

obese growth factor leptin16, master regulator of hypoxia HIF1-alpha,17 and proinflammatory
TNF-alpha17. For example, leptin induces FGF23 expression and inhibits CYP27B1
expression18, implying a potential compromised status of 1,25-hydroxy vitamin D under
conditions of obesity. Recent data suggest that increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in
SARS-CoV2 infected patients with a reduced level of vitamin D19. Currently, we do not
know the status of FGF23 and other core modifiers of the vitamin D pathway in lung cells of
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
For productive infection, many viruses use the host machinery to antagonize the host
defense mechanism while using survival pathways to abort apoptosis for ensuring a
successful completion of their replication and generation of progeny virions. In this context,
previous work suggest that during the host–RNA-virus interaction, pathogen replication and
its propagation are profoundly influenced by human p21-activated kinases (PAKs)20, which
are the established modifiers of cytoskeleton remodeling, inflammation, thrombosis, cell
survival, and gene expression or repression, in addition to its oncogenic role in cancer
development progression21–25. However, to the best of our knowledge, no published data exist
about the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on PAK mRNA expression levels in the context of the
vitamin D pathway. Current data suggest a mechanistic role of PAK-dependent actin
polymerization in vitamin D-mediated stimulation of FGF23 expression26; vitamin D
signaling stimulates actin depolymerization in endometrial cancer by inhibiting RAC1 and
PAK1 expression27; the vitamin D pathway uses PAK1 in protecting murine fibroblasts from
vitamin E-succinate-triggered apoptosis; and dependency of cholecalciferol-mediated NF-kB
transactivation on PAK1 activity28. These examples of regulatory crosstalk between vitamin
D and PAKs suggest that the cellular effects of vitamin D in the context of SARS-CoV-2
pathobiology might not be merely affected by the biosynthesis of cholecalciferol but also by

the status of FGF23, vitamin D metabolic enzymes, and PAK signaling. However, the status
of vitamin D pathways in SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown.
To better understand the significance of vitamin D in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, we
applied computational approaches to study the expression levels of core components and
modifiers of the vitamin D pathway and to understand its potential relationship with the status
of the PAK pathway in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals.
RESULTS
Status of the vitamin D pathway in viral infection model systems
To better understand the significance of the vitamin D pathway in the pathobiology of SARSCoV-2 infection, we first examined the expression levels of core components of the vitamin
D pathway in various models of viral infection using the Signaling Pathways Project Datasets
(SPPD), a collection of transcriptomic datasets initially biocurated by the Nuclear Receptor
Signaling Atlas Organization29. As illustrated in Fig. 1, we found evidence of both down- and
upregulation of molecules belonging to the vitamin D pathway. In general, we noticed a
preferential downregulation of the vitamin D pathway in majority of the studies compiled in
SPPD. We believe that the noted variability in the levels of molecules among various
independent biological studies is a common observation and might arise because of
differences in the nature and preparation of test samples as well as experimental conditions
and reagents used in the different studies. Specifically, we observed reduced expression of
vitamin D coreceptors RXRA, CYP27A1, CYP24A1, and FGFR1-4 in most of the SARS
virus-derived datasets. However, most of the SPPD datasets lacked information of the
vitamin D pathway in the SARS-CoV-2 infection model system, except for CYP27B1
upregulation. In general, these observations are consistent with the notion of a general

reduced expression of several, but not all, components of the vitamin D pathway caused by
viruses.

Suppression of the vitamin D pathway in lung cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV2
To assess the status of the vitamin D pathway in lung cells of patients infected with SARSCoV-2, we next evaluated the levels of core molecules of the vitamin D pathway in three
separate RNA sequencing-based transcriptomic datasets of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
(BALF) cells from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and in control healthy
subjects30–32, as well as in A549, NHBE, and Calu3 human lung cell lines expressing infected
SARS-CoV-231. Our analysis indicated an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and
reduced expression of VDR and its mandatory binding partner RXR and reduced expression
of CYP27A1 in two of the three human transcriptomic studies and increased expression of
CYP24A1 and reduced expression of FGFR1 in only one of the three SARS-CoV-2-infected
patients’ transcriptomic studies (Fig. 2a, Supplementary table 1). In contrast to the levels of
core components of the vitamin D pathway in BALF cells from SARS-CoV-2-infected
patients, infection associated SARS-CoV-2 overexpression in three lung cancer cells did not
alter the expression of most components of the vitamin D pathway. However, SARS-CoV-2
overexpression in A549 and Calu3 cells downregulated FGFR1-4 levels (Fig. 2b,
Supplementary table 1). These observations suggest that data from cell lines infected with
ectopic overexpression by infection of SARS-CoV-2 may not always be compatible with
patient-derived primary cultured cells to understand the significance of the vitamin D
pathway in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Therefore, we focused on transcriptomic data
from the patients in subsequent analyses.

Vitamin D-modulated genes overlap with differentially expressed genes in lung cells of
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2
Vitamin D mediates its biological effects via upregulating or downregulating the expression
of cellular genes responsible for various biological processes. Vitamin D modifies the
expression of cellular genes either through a direct mechanism involving predicted or
validated VDR motifs in the target genes and/or through indirect pathways34,35. Further, we
assessed whether noted downregulation of the vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2 might also
be accompanied by misregulation of vitamin D-modulated genes, and eventually, resultant
functions of such gene products. Thus, as illustrated in Fig. 3a, we found a widespread
overlap of vitamin D-modulated genes with differentially expressed genes in three
transcriptomic datasets from cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Upon crosscomparing vitamin D-modulated genes that overlapped in SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomic
datasets used here, we recognized 43 differentially expressed vitamin D-modulated genes that
shared vitamin D dataset and three transcriptomic datasets from lung cells of patients infected
with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3b).
Enrichment analysis of 43 vitamin D-modulated genes in samples collected from
COVID patients suggested that many of these genes were downregulated in SARS-CoV-2infected lung cells31 and CD14+ monocytes36. The associated primary pathways included
neutrophil degranulation, regulation of multiorganism processes, and positive regulation of
apoptosis37 (Fig. 3c, d). They could potentially influence a whole range of functions in SARCoV-2-infected lung cells in a vitamin D-sensitive manner (Supplementary tables 2,3).
Expression profiling of these 43 genes indicated that 12 vitamin D-modulated genes (HTT,
KCNAB2, EHMT1, RGS3, HEXA, NLRP1, GGA3, MYO1G, ARRB1, PSMD3, MGAT1,
and EIF3D) were downregulated in 3 SAR-CoV-2 datasets, 9 genes (SIRPB1, CD4, CTSC,
LIPA, PDE4DIP, ITSN1, SSH2, IER2, and HCFC1R1) in 2 datasets, and 3 genes (SECTM1,

FOXN3, and GADD45B) in 1 SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomic dataset (Fig. 3e). additionally,
Fig. 3e shows the levels of downregulation of 12 genes that overlapped with vitamin Dmodulated genes in cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Network analysis of these
12 genes (shown by green circles, Fig. 3f, right) indicated that several of such downregulated
genes, such as ARRB1, RGS3, GGA3, HEXA, EIF3D, and PSMD3, are functionally related
to the immune system (Functional enrichment analysis of network genes using Reactome
with a rank of 56, p-value 1.31e-21, Supplementary Table 4). Significance of downregulation
of these shared 12 genes is judged by the nature of their functions. For example, functions
associated with the following genes are expected to be compromised in SARS-CoV-2infected lung cells: (i) EIF3D, a component of the protein translational complex; reduction in
the levels of this component inhibits CD8+ T cell activity and promotes HIV progression38,
(ii) NLRP1, a component of inflammasome with role in innate immunity39, and (iii) RGS3, a
G protein signaling component with role in T-lymphocyte motility during T helper 2 (Th2)driven inflammation in airway cells40.
Among the 43 differentially expressed genes, 19 genes (SLPI, CCL2, STEAP4,
FGL2, MARCKS, TMEM71, MXD1, DAPP1, IFITM2, OAS1, SELL, CSTA, CIR1, TIMP1,
DYNLT1, IRF2, YWHAE, SCLT1, and NOP10) were upregulated in 3 SARS-CoV-2
datasets; 3 genes (GADD45B, FOXN3, and SECTM1) were upregulated in 2 datasets, and 10
genes (HCFC1R1, IER2, SIRPB1, CD4, CTSC, LIPA, PDE4DIP, ITSN1, and SSH2) were
upregulated in 1 dataset (Fig. 3e). Network analysis revealed that the upregulated genes were
strongly correlated with the immune system. Surprisingly, Reactome pathway enrichment
analysis of network of 19 up-regulated genes identified the immune system, cytokine
signaling, and adaptive and innate immunity as first four primary enriched gene sets (Fig. 3f,
Supplementary Table 5). We found that many of the differentially expressed genes (that
overlapped with vitamin D-modulated genes) in the cells of patients infected with SARS-

CoV-2 having a role in antiviral responses were induced during viral infection. Interestingly,
a subset of differentially expressed 19 genes in lung cells of patients infected with SARSCoV-2 included genes that have been implicated in the action of interferons, development of
antiviral response, and regulation of innate immune responses in individuals and cells
infected with viruses41–47. Examples of such upregulated genes included 2'-5'-oligoadenylate
synthetase 1 (OAS1), an interferon-responsive gene48–50, interferon regulatory factor 2
(IRF2), interferon-induced transmembrane protein 2 (IFITM2), secretory leukocyte peptidase
inhibitor (SLP1), max dimerization protein 1 (MXD1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase1 (TIMP1), PH domain-containing adaptor Bam32/DAPP1, and T helper type 1
(Th1)/monocyte-associated chemokine CCL2, which have been shown to also participate in
SARS-CoV-2–AEC2 signaling in lung cells51. In fact, upregulation of OAS1 and IFITM2 has
been recently noticed as a common feature in patients infected with SARS-CoV-241, and
certain variants of OAS1 have been predicted to influence SARS-CoV-2 infection52. These
observations suggest that the noticed reduced expression of the vitamin D pathway in lung
cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 could be associated with both down- and
upregulation of cellular genes because vitamin D is known to regulate gene expression both
positively and negatively. These observations suggested codysregulation of the vitamin D
pathway with molecules with roles in Th1 response and immune regulation pathways in a
subset of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Exploring a potential relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and PAKs
The PAK family of cellular kinases has been found to be activated by pathogens, including
RNA viruses such as influenza and HIV53,54. Over the years, PAKs have been implicated in
various stages of virus entry and replication and in supporting the cell survival phenotype
during certain viral infections20. To understand the significance of the PAK pathway in

SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, we first examined the status of PAKs in SPPD. We found that
the levels of PAK1 and PAK4 mRNAs are generally upregulated in model systems pertaining
to middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCOV), whereas PAK2 and PAK3 are
downregulated in MERSCOV models (Fig. 4a).
Further, we examined the levels PAK1–4 in transcriptomic analyses in lung cells of
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. We noticed PAK1 mRNA upregulation in datasets of all
three patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, whereas PAK2 upregulation was observed in one
of the transcriptomic datasets. No significant alteration was observed in the differential
expression of PAK3 and PAK4 in samples collected from patients infected with SARS-CoV2 compared with the healthy controls (Fig. 4b). In addition to PAK kinases, cell survival is
known to be profoundly regulated by AKT kinases55,56. However, as opposed to PAKs, we
noticed a reduction in AKT levels in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Fig. 4b). These
observations suggested an association between the levels of PAK1 mRNA and SARS-CoV-2
infection. However, the current literature provides no clues about the role of PAK expression
in the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

A subset of differentially expressed genes in SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells is a shared
target of PAK- and vitamin D-modulated genes
Our finding of a compromised expression of several components of the vitamin D pathway
and increased PAK1 expression in the same transcriptomic analyses of lung cells of patients
infected with SARS-CoV-2 raised a possibility of an association between these two
phenomena. We attempted to explore this possibility. In this context, previous studies have
suggested a role of PAK-dependent modulation of actin polymerization in the regulation of
FGF2326,27, a modifier of CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 in the vitamin D pathway, and the
vitamin D pathway have been suggested to inhibit the levels of RAC (a positive regulator of

PAK1 activation) in endometrial cancer cells27. A recent review article57 has speculated the
possibility of PAK1 regulation of CCL2, a molecule shown to connect ACE2 with liver
fibrosis in a murine model58, during SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, data supporting a
connection between PAK1 and SARS-CoV-2 pathways remained uninvestigated until this
point.

Because we observed a compromised vitamin D pathway and increased PAK1 expression in
the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, we further searched for genes that might be common
effectors of vitamin D and PAK pathways. Fig. 5a shows that indeed there is a widespread
overlap of genes common to vitamin D- and PAK-regulated genes. Our analysis identified
563 differentially expressed genes common to vitamin D- and PAK-regulated datasets (Fig.
5b). The expression levels of the two sets of genes are depicted in the heatmap (Fig. 5c). We
next searched 563 differentially expressed genes for vitamin D-modulated genes that might
be downregulated or upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, presumably because of a
compromised vitamin D pathway or gene expression due to derepression. We believe that
such genes might be the shared effectors of vitamin D and PAK pathways in lung cells of
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and hence, they might be involved in SARS-CoV-2
pathobiology.
We focused on vitamin D-modulated genes that were downregulated in two out of
three SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomic studies. Our analysis identified 40 such downregulated
genes out of 563 differentially expressed genes, shared between vitamin D and PAK
pathways, in SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells (Fig. 5b). Similarly, there are 24 upregulated
genes (shared between vitamin D and PAK pathways) in SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells
(Fig. 5b). These observations suggest that the evident dysregulated vitamin D pathway in
SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells could be accompanied by both down- and upregulation of
downstream effectors that are also shared effectors of the PAK1 pathway in SARS-CoV-2-

infected lung cells. Because SARS-CoV-2 induces PAK1 expression in lung cells and PAK1
signaling stimulates as well as represses several cellular genes21-25, a subset of genes in
SARS-CoV-2 infected cells might be coinfluenced by a defective vitamin D and viral
infection-associated PAK1 upregulation.

Vitamin D pathway and SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis
Aforementioned analysis identified 43 vitamin D-modulated genes dysregulated in lung cells
of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Network analysis of 43 genes revealed that many of
these genes are functionally related to NF-kB pathway and cytokine signaling, DNA damage
checkpoint and response (rank 2 and 3), and apoptosis (rank 4) (Fig. 6a). Similarly, network
analysis of 40 downregulated genes, which were shared targets of vitamin D and PAK
pathways, in SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells indicated that genes in the top four rank orders
belong to different aspects of regulation of immune response (Fig. 6b). In contrast to the
aforementioned downregulated genes, network analysis of 24 upregulated genes, which were
shared targets of vitamin D and PAK pathways, suggested cell cycle regulation and gene
expression as the top functional targets (Fig. 6c). These observations raised the possibility
that the evident downregulation of vitamin D and upregulation of PAK1 in SARS-CoV-2infected cells is likely to have a significant influence upon NF-kB pathway, cytokine
signalling and immune regulation. The critical role of genes important for promoting the G1
- S progression as well as key components of the cell survival
pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 is also evident in the analysis.

Further studies are warranted

to delineate the mechanism underlying these findings with a broad implication in the
pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2.

Targets of the dysregulated vitamin D pathway with or without VDR in SARS-CoV-2infected lung cells
The vitamin D pathway exerts its cellular effects through nongenomic/cytoplasmic and
nuclear effects. Vitamin D regulates the expression of cellular genes either through
modifying the expression of target genes containing vitamin D responsive elements (VDR) or
indirect mechanisms as a consequence of other effects of vitamin D. VDR as a heterodimer
protein complex with receptor RXR binding to the DR3-response element consisting of
A/GGG/TTC/GA motif34,59. We next searched for the presence of VDR motifs within
−1000bp and −100bp from TSS in target gene promoters among 43 differentially expressed
vitamin D-modulated genes and 40 differentially expressed genes between vitamin D
modulated and PAK pathways in the SARS-CoV-2-infected transcriptome. Surprisingly, we
found the presence of VDR motifs in 3 of the 43 differentially expressed genes (JAG1,
ST3GAL1, and ZNF589) and in 5 of the 40 differentially expressed genes (ITSN1,
GADD45B, PDE4DIP, HTT, and MARCKS) in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Figs. 7a,b).
These observations suggest that a defective vitamin D pathway could impact the levels of
differential expression of vitamin D-modulated genes in SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells via
both direct mechanisms involving the VDR motif in the target genes and indirect
mechanisms.

Discussion
In brief, the present study was conducted to assess the status of the vitamin D pathway in
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 using public transcriptomic datasets and computational
approaches. Results presented support the notion of a potential association between SARSCoV-2 infection and reduced expression of several components of the vitamin D pathway. As
expected, the dysregulated vitamin D pathway in the lung cells of patients infected with

SARS-CoV-2 was accompanied by dysregulation (both down- and upregulation) of cellular
genes of vitamin D-modulated genes, including molecules involved in Th1 response and
immune regulation. Another novel notable observation is the upregulation of PAK1
expression (but not another family of survival AKT kinases) in the same SARS-CoV-2
sample sets with a reduced expression of vitamin D pathway components, suggesting a
potential correlative relationship between these two phenomena. Consistent with this
hypothesis, we noticed that indeed a subset of differentially expressed genes in lung cells of
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is also the shared target of PAK- and vitamin Dmodulated genes and such genes were coinfluenced by not only a defective vitamin D
pathway but also PAK1 upregulation associated with SARS-CoV-2-infection; thus, they are
involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology. Future studies are required to define the precise
levels of crosstalk between PAK1 and vitamin D pathways and to determine whether PAK1
plays a role in the dysregulated vitamin D pathway.
As vitamin D modulates the expression of several cellular genes through a direct
mechanism involving VDR motifs in the putative target genes as well as through indirect
mechanisms, we observed that most differentially expressed genes, common to vitamin D
and/or PAK-modulated genes, in SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells lacked the VDR motif in
target gene promoters. Hence, they were expected to be regulated by indirect mechanisms in
SARS-CoV-2-infected cells by vitamin D. However, our analysis did discover, at least, eight
new vitamin D target genes with a conserved VDR motif within −1000 and −100 from TSS
in gene promoters as differentially expressed genes in SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells. This
raised the possibility of direct mechanisms of regulation of such vitamin D-modulated genes
by the dysregulated vitamin D pathway.

To highlight the potential significance of a subset of eight newly recognized VDRcontaining target genes in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, we here briefly discuss the potential
connection between six differentially expressed genes in SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells;
however, ZNF589 and HTT remained novel in the context of viral infection.
Intersectin-1 (ITSN1): Cytoskeleton remodeling and interactions, including dynamics of actin
polymerization–depolymerization, which is a process also regulated by PAK signaling21,
plays a role in the early steps of endocytosis during viral infection and phagocytosis60,61. One
such regulator is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor ITSN1 with an established role in
vaccinia infection-associated actin polymerization and Fc-gamma receptor-mediated
phagocytosis62. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, actin remodeling represents a
central event in inflammatory responses in the lungs63 and might be involved in virus entry64.
Further, components of actin remodeling have emerged as important interactors of
membranous ACE265, which is the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Likewise, Fc-gammamediated phagocytosis, a process known to be regulated by ITSN1, plays an important role in
immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection66. These observations in conjunction with
the identification of ITSN1 as one of the vitamin D-modulated differentially expressed genes
in SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells further raise the possibility of connecting a dysregulated
vitamin D pathway with misregulation of any of the aforementioned cellular functions of
ITSN1.
Growth Arrest and DNA Damage Inducible Beta (GADD45B): GADD45B and GADD45A
have been shown to be important in the regulation of DNA damage response and
senescence67. Relevance of the presence of a conserved VDR motif in the promoter region of
GADD45B and its differential expression in SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells (as shown in
this study) lies in a recent finding presenting the differential expression of GADD45B as well

as other genes belonging to mitochondrial functions in patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD)68. Further, as older patients with COPD are more susceptible
to

SARS-CoV-2

infection69 ,

GADD45B

might

be

involved

in

SARS-CoV-2

pathobiology in patients with COPD.
Phosphodiesterase 4D-interacting protein (PDE4DIP): PDE4DIP is an understudied enzyme
that hydrolyzes the 3′ cyclic phosphate linkages in 3′,5′-cAMP and cGMP and 3′,5′-cAMP
and participate in cellular signaling and other processes70. PDE4DIP has recently been
suggested to be a differentially expressed genes in lung cells in COPD71. As no precedence of
vitamin D regulation of PDE4DIP exists, our present finding indicates the possibility of a
regulatory relationship between vitamin D and cyclin AMP or GMP signaling in SARS-CoV2 pathobiology in lung cells.
ST3 Beta-Galactoside Alpha-2,3-Sialyltransferase 1 (ST3GAL1): ST3GAL1 is an enzyme
with sialyltransferase activity. It participates in transferring sialic acid to substrates with
galactose as the acceptor and is involved in glycosylation21. Glycosylation is fundamental to
the regulation of numerous cellular processes, including vitamin D-binding proteins72. As
certain genetic variants of ST3GAL1 have been shown to be associated with an increased
probability of severity in patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection73, the
dysregulated vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients might be accompanied by
misglycosylation of certain proteins, which in turn may impact SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology in
lung cells.
Jagged-1 (JAG1): Activation of Notch receptors by Notch ligands, including JAG1, and
resulting signaling events have been shown to be involved in cell-to-cell communication. In
addition, JAGs/Notch signaling influences diverse aspects of cytokine biology, inflammation,
dendritic cell biology, T-cell development, B-cell repertoire, and innate immunity74–77.

Further, Notch signaling has been suggested to be downstream of IL6, which is a
proinflammatory cytokine with a role in the inflammatory storm, in the lung and heart78. In
the context of viral infection, JAG1/Notch 1 signaling participates in the development of Th2
response in bronchial epithelial cells following infection with respiratory syncytial
infection79. Interestingly, experimental downregulation of JAG1has been shown to promote
Th1 response while suppressing Th2 differentiation, a situation similar to that observed in
SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells in this study79. This situation is also somewhat similar to
that of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells and is shown to be Th1 type80. These
observations and the finding in this study that JAG1 could be a vitamin D-regulated gene
suggest that a dysregulated vitamin D pathway might influence cellular immunity via the
JAG1 pathway.
Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS): MARCKS, a substrate of protein
kinase C and actin-interacting protein, is present in the plasma membrane. It modulates
vascular contractility and regulates Ca2+ and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
signaling81. Upon activation by PKC signaling, MARCKS translocates from the plasma
membrane to the cytoplasm and regulates many cellular processes depending on actin
remodeling, such as membrane trafficking and phagocytosis. MARCKS has been shown to be
involved in lung diseases, including COPD and asthma82, probably because of its ability to
regulate mucin secretion and inflammation83. Activation of PKC, either directly or through
secreted cytokines, is generally viewed a common event during viral infections, including
human immunodeficiency virus in promonocytic cells, respiratory syncytial virus in
bronchial epithelial cells84,85, and hepatitis B virus transactivator HBx86. Additionally, Ang II
has been shown to activate PKC-β, and in turn, cellular redistribution of MARCKS in
neurons87. Vitamin D3 metabolites are known activators of PKC, and vitamin D deficiency is
associated with a dysregulated subcellular distribution of PKC isoforms in rat colonocytes88.

The aforementioned observations suggest that a defective vitamin D pathway might be
associated with a misregulated subcellular distribution of MARCKS in lung cells and could
be involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology.
In brief, this study provides insights about a potentially causal association between a
compromised vitamin D pathway at multiple levels and SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients,
and consequently, dysregulation of pathways downstream to vitamin D. These preliminary
results now set the stage for experimental validation of the observations and postulations
made using computational approaches. Additionally, this study also sets the stage for
conducting a larger study to determine whether a compromised vitamin D pathway might
influence the susceptibility of lung cells to SARS-CoV-2 and/or the consequence of SARSCoV-2 infection.
