Abstract
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin
system, is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. To determine
whether the renin-angiotensin inhibition regulates ACE2 expression, either enalapril (an
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) or losartan (an AT1 receptor blocker) was
infused subcutaneously to male C57BL/6J mice for two weeks. Neither enalapril nor
losartan changed abundance of ACE2 mRNA in lung, ileum, kidney, and heart. Viral
entry also depends on transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to prime the S
protein. TMPRSS2 mRNA was abundant in lungs and ileum, modest in kidney, but
barely detectable in heart. TMPRSS2 mRNA abundance was not altered by either
enalapril or losartan in any of the 4 tissues. Next, we determined whether depletion of
angiotensinogen (AGT), the unique substrate of the renin-angiotensin system, changes
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA abundance. AGT antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) were
injected subcutaneously to male C57BL/6J mice for 3 weeks. Abundance of ACE2
mRNA was unchanged in any of the 4 tissues, but TMPRSS2 mRNA was significantly
decreased in lungs. Our data support that the renin-angiotensin inhibition does not
regulate ACE2 and hence are not likely to increase risk for COVID-19.

Results and Discussion
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) degrades angiotensin (Ang)I and II, and
additionally is a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
Viral entry into host cells occurs through binding of the viral spike (S) protein and
ACE2.1 Preclinical data suggest that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers
upregulate ACE2.2, 3 As a consequence, RAS blockers have been suggested to
increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection. However,
recent large retrospective studies strongly argue against this hypothesis and rather
suggest that RAS blockers might be protective in such patients.4 Since the findings on
RAS blocker-induced ACE2 upregulation are inconsistent, and differed not only per type
of RAS inhibitors (ACE inhibitors versus angiotensin receptor blockers [ARB]),3 between
blockers of a certain type (i.e., between various ARBs5), but also per organ, and
required high doses, one further option is that this ACE2 upregulation is not the
unavoidable consequence of RAS suppression, but rather reflects the non-specific
effects of a certain RAS blocker when applied at a high dose. Applying antisense
oligonucleotides (ASO) as a tool to suppress the RAS would circumvent the latter. In the
present study we therefore compared the effects of an ACE inhibitor (enalapril) and an
ARB (losartan), infused subcutaneously to male C57BL/6J mice via mini osmotic
pumps, with those of subcutaneously injected angiotensinogen (AGT) antisense
oligonucleotides on tissue ACE2.
After 14 days of infusion, both enalapril and losartan increased plasma renin >100-fold,
confirming effective RAS inhibition (Figure A). ACE2 mRNA abundance was
determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in lung, ileum, kidney, and heart tissues.
Neither enalapril nor losartan changed the abundance of ACE2 mRNA in any of the
tissues (Figure B). Ferrario et al.3 reported that administration of lisinopril (an ACE
inhibitor) or losartan for 12 days increases ACE2 mRNA abundance approximately 3 - 5
old in male rat heart. It is worth noting that ACE2 mRNA is much less abundant in heart
compared with lung, ileum, and kidney (data not shown).
Viral entry also depends on transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to prime S
protein.1 TMPRSS2 mRNA was highly abundant in lung and ileum, moderately in
kidney, while barely detectable in heart (data not shown). Thus, ACE2 and TMPRSS2
are co-expressed most abundantly in lung and ileum, consistent with their roles in ARSCoV-2 infection. As with ACE2, TMPRSS2 mRNA abundance was not altered by either
enalapril or losartan (Figure C).

A-C. Male C57BL/6J mice were infused subcutaneously with either enalapril (3
mg/kg/day) or losartan (15 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. D-F. Male C57BL/6J mice were
administered AGT ASO (80 mg/kg at day 1 and 4, 40 mg/kg at day 8 and 15) via
subcutaneous injection. Plasma renin concentrations (A and D) were measured using
an ELISA kit. (B, C, E, F) ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA abundance were quantified by
qPCR with TaqMan probes (ID: Mm01159003_m1 and ID: Mm00443687_m1,
respectively) and normalized to the geomean of three reference genes: ACTB, GAPDH,
and PPIA. Genes with a cycle threshold (Ct) greater than 35 were considered
undetectable. Error bars denote SEM; n = 5 for all experimental groups. * P < 0.001

elevated plasma renin levels supported RAS blockade (Figure D). However, abundance

of ACE2 mRNA was unchanged in all tissues (Figure E). Interestingly, AGT ASO
significantly decreased TMPRSS2 mRNA abundance in lungs (Figure F).
In summary, RAS inhibition did not affect mRNA abundance of ACE2 in male C57BL/6J
mice administered enalapril, losartan, or AGT ASO. AGT ASO reduces TMPRSS2
mRNA expression in lungs, which is potentially protective against viral entry. These data
support that RAS inhibition per se does not regulate ACE2 and hence is unlikely to
increase the risk for COVID-19. In agreement with this concept, Sama et al.6 recently
were unable to detect changes in circulating ACE2 in patients taking RAS inhibitors.
