ABSTRACT
Since its first recorded appearance in December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
causing the disease COVID-19 has resulted in more than 2,000,000 infections and 128,000
deaths. Currently there is no proven treatment for COVID-19 and there is an urgent need for
the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Coronavirus spike glycoproteins play a critical
role in coronavirus entry into the host cells, as they provide host cell recognition and membrane
fusion between virus and host cell. Thus, they emerged as popular and promising drug targets.
Crystal structures of spike protein in its closed and open states were resolved very recently in
March 2020. These structures comprise 77% of the sequence and provide almost the complete
protein structure. Based on down and up positions of receptor binding domain (RBD), spike
protein can be in a receptor inaccessible closed or receptor accessible open state, respectively.
Starting from closed and open state crystal structures, and also 16 intermediate conformations,
an extensive set of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the presence of explicit

water and ions were performed. Simulations show that in its down position, RBD has
significantly lower mobility compared to its up position; probably caused by the 6 interdomain
salt bridges of RBD in down position compared to 3 in up position. Free energy landscapes
based on MD simulations revealed a semi-open state located between closed and open states.
Minimum energy pathway between down and up positions comprised a gradual salt bridge
switching mechanism. Furthermore, although significantly lower than open state, ACE2
binding surface of RBD contained a partial solvent accessibility in its closed state.

I. INTRODUCTION
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged as a human pathogen
in the city of Wuhan, China. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has spread worldwide rapidly. As of 17
April 2020, there are more than 2,000,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases globally, among them
at least 135,000 have resulted in death (World Health Organization). Based on its genome
sequence, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to same genus (betacoronavirus) as the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV). SARS-CoV emerged in the Guangdong province of China in 2002
and resulted in an epidemic outbreak infecting 8,098 and killing 774 people (Drosten et al.
2003, Walls et al. 2020). MERS-CoV emerged in 2012 in the Arabian Peninsula, where it
remains a major public health concern, having infected ~2519 and killed 858 people in 27
countries (Memish et al. 2020, Walls, Park et al. 2020). Phylogenetic analyses have suggested
that SARS-CoV-2 shares 82% gene sequence identity with SARS-CoV (Lu et al. 2020, Wu et
al. 2020, Zhu et al. 2020) and 51.8% gene sequence identity with MERS-CoV (Han and Yang
2020). Coronaviruses (CoVs) comprise a large and diverse family. Though having such high
gene sequence identity with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be
transmitted among humans more readily and much faster than SARS-CoV (Li et al. 2003,
Wrapp et al. 2020) and MERS-CoV (Paraskevis et al. 2020, Zhu, Zhang et al. 2020). COVID19 clinical symptoms are fever, dry cough, severe respiratory failure, and pneumonia (Wu, Zhao
et al. 2020, Zhou et al. 2020). On 10 March 2020, COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic by
the World Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization 2020). Currently there is
no proven treatment for COVID-19. Thus, there is a pressing need for the development of
vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19.
Recognition of host cell and entry of the virus are the most critical steps determining the
pathogenesis and viral infectivity in viral infections (Gallagher and Buchmeier 2001). Host cell
recognition and fusion between host cell and viral membranes is provided by large trimeric
spike (S) glycoproteins located on the CoV membrane (Fig. 1) (Belouzard et al. 2012). These
S proteins interact with the human epithelial and respiratory cells via the angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors of the host cells (Letko et al. 2020, Wrapp, Wang et al. 2020).
Upon receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage, large-scale conformational changes in S
protein structure occur and S protein interaction with the host cell membrane takes place
facilitating the fusion process. Due to their critical role in the entry of coronaviruses into host
cells, SARS-CoV-2 S proteins have emerged as a popular and promising therapeutic target. In

the current study, structure and dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is investigated via allatom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to provide critical atomic level insight into the
conformational transition mechanism of S protein from a receptor inaccessible closed to an
accessible open state, which in turn has the potential to strongly benefit development of
therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.

FIG. 1. (a) Schematic representation of the structure of a coronavirus. (b) Crystal structure of
the S protein (PDB ID: 6VXX). S protein is a large trimeric protein decorated with N-linked
glycans (purple). S protein protomers, all of which are in down conformation, are shown in
yellow, blue and gray. (c) S protein protomer structure in its down conformation is shown.
Domains of an S protomer; NTD, RBD, FP, and HR1, CD, and glycans are shown in blue, red,
mustard, orange, green, and purple, respectively. (d) The representative scheme of functional
domains in S protein of SARS-CoV-2.
Each S protein protomer consists of two functional subunits (Fig. 1(c,d)): S1 subunit is
responsible for binding to host receptor and S2 subunit contains the membrane fusion
machinery (Walls et al. 2017, Kirchdoerfer et al. 2018). S1 subunit comprises two functional
domains: N-terminal domain (NTD) and a receptor-binding domain (RBD), both of which are
responsible for the binding to the host cell receptor (Li, Moore et al. 2003). S2 subunit contains
three functional domains; fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat (HR) 1, and HR2 (Jiang et al.
2020). Based on the RBD position, S protein can be in a receptor inaccessible closed or receptor
accessible open state. As shown in Fig. 2, in the receptor inaccessible closed state, all RBDs
are in the down position covering the S2 subunits; whereas in the receptor accessible open state,
at least a single RBD is in an up position being rotated outwards from S2, hence exposing its
receptor binding surface. Conformational switch of RBD from the down to up conformation is
a prerequisite for ACE2 binding of the S protein. There are two cleavage sites in each protomer
of the S protein. Among them, the S2’ site is located upstream from the FP. S1/S2 site, on the
other hand, is located 103 residues downstream from S2’ and located at the boundary between
the S1 and S2 subunits. Cleavage at S2’ sites is a requirement for fusion of host cell and virus
membranes as it exposes the FPs at S2 to the environment and also separates the protein into
S1-ectodomain and viral anchored S2 subunit. However, there is no consensus whether S1/S2
site cleavage is a requirement for S protein transition from pre to post fusion state. Upon S1/S2
site cleavage, S protein is divided into S1 and S2 subunits, which remain non-covalently bound
in this metastable prefusion conformation (Bosch et al. 2003, Park et al. 2016, Kirchdoerfer,

Wang et al. 2018). During cell infection, S protein binds to the host cell receptor ACE2 via
RBD (Li, Moore et al. 2003, Wong et al. 2004, Zhou et al. 2020). Protein-receptor binding is
expected to initiate a set of structural rearrangements in the S protein. Cleavage in S2’ promotes
rearrangement of HR1 in the S2 subunit into an extended α-helix and insertion of the FP into
the host membrane. Subsequently, a six-helix bundle comprising HR2 and HR1 is formed
(Bullough et al. 1994, Bosch, van der Zee et al. 2003, Walls, Tortorici et al. 2017). This
completes the transition of the S protein from its metastable pre-fusion state to a highly stable
post-fusion state. S protein conformational transition results in the fusion of viral and host
membranes, thus allowing the release of the viral genome into host cell (Walls, Tortorici et al.
2017).

protein conformation is shown from a side view. Closed and open state conformations sampled
from MD simulations structures are aligned based on their secondary structures in S2 subunit.
RBD of closed and open states are shown in red and green colors, respectively. Since the
remaining structure is almost identical between up and down conformations, for the up
conformation only the RBD is shown. Protomers A, B, and C are shown in gray, yellow, and
light blue colors. (b) Closed and open states of S protein trimer is shown from top view. (c) Salt
bridges observed between RBD and the neighboring protomers in closed (1 to 6) and open (7
to 9) states during MD simulations.
The first SARS-CoV-2 S protein structure was resolved in its open state and released on
February 26 2020 with the PDB ID 6VSB. This structure had a 3.46 Å resolution and covers
76.8% of the sequence. Shortly after, on March 11 2020, SARS-CoV-2 S protein structures
were resolved in their closed and open states having PDB IDs 6VXX and 6VYB. These closed

and open structures have resolutions 2.8 Å and 3.2 Å, respectively, and each cover 76.4% of
the protein sequence. Based on the crystal structures, the transition between the two states can
be predicted to occur through a hinge-like conformational movement of RBD transiently hiding
or exposing the determinants of receptor binding. As of today, there are no all-atom MD
simulations studies published that investigated the dynamics of any of the abovementioned
close-to-full length SARS-CoV-2 S protein structures (PDB IDs: 6VYB, 6VXX, and/or 6VSB).
The earliest being on February 21 2020, a few preprints of computational studies were recently
deposited to bioRxiv investigating binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 (Peng et al.
2020, Shah et al. 2020, Smith and Smith 2020) and peptide/molecule binding to SARS-CoV-2
RBD (Zhang et al. 2020) via MD simulations. Upon performing MD simulations starting from
the closed (PDB ID: 6VXX) and open (PDB ID: 6VYB) state structures, our current study
shows that a salt bridge network between RBD and neighboring protomers exist in the closed
state all of which is are gradually abrogated along the closed to open transition of the S protein.
Furthermore, closed state is stabilized by newly formed salt bridges with the neighboring
protomer. MD simulations showed that solvent accessibility of the ACE2 binding surface of
RBD changes significantly upon the transition between open and closed states. Our simulations
provided a description of the energy landscape for the transition between closed and open states
of S protein by sampling the conformational space near the structurally resolved states as well
as the region connecting these states. A new semi-open state was identified approximately
midway along the transition pathway.

II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Molecular dynamics system preparation
Coronavirus S protein structures having PDB IDs 6VYB (Walls, Park et al. 2020) and 6VXX
(Walls, Park et al. 2020), which are in the closed and open states respectively, were used as
starting structures in our MD simulations. As shown in Fig. 1, these crystal structures comprise
most of the S protein domains; S1 subunit (NTD and RBD) and S2 (FP and HR1). Furthermore,
S trimers are extensively decorated with N-linked glycans (Fig. 1), which are important for
proper folding (Rossen et al. 1998) and for modulating accessibility to host proteases and
neutralizing antibodies (Walls et al. 2016, Yang et al. 2016, Xiong et al. 2018, Walls et al.
2019). Closed and open state crystal structures of the S protein were obtained by performing
the following mutation: (i) R682S, R683G, and R685G, which were performed to abrogate furin
S1/S2 cleavage site, and (ii) K986P and V987P, which were performed for stabilization
(stabilizing structure). The trimeric crystal structures comprise the sequence A27-S1147 of each
protomer. However, out of these 1121 residues there are structural information missing for 149
of them in the closed state: V70-F79, Y144-N164, Q173-N185, R246-A262, V445-G446,
L455-C488, G502, P621-S640, Q677-A688, L828-Q853. For the open state, on the other hand,
there are 155, 172 and 161 residues missing for its three protomers (denoted by A, B and C) as
follows: V70-N81, T114-Q115, Y144-N165, Q173-N185, A243-A262, S443-G447, E471Y489, G502, P621-S640, Q677-S689, P812, L828-L854 of protomer A, A67-D80, L141-A163,
Q173-N185, I197-G199, L212-R214, A243-A262, L455-L461, D467-F490, E516-P521, P621S640, Q677-A688, P812, L828-Q853 of protomer B, and A67-D80, Y144-N165, Q173-N185,

of protomer C. In order to model the missing residue stretches and add them to the protein
structures, the three-dimensional structures of the closed and open states were modeled using
SWISS-MODEL web server (Waterhouse et al. 2018) using 6VXX and 6VYB structures,
respectively, as templates. For both closed and open states, the FASTA sequence spanning
residues A27-S1147 for each S protein protomer is taken from NCBI having RefSeq:
YP_009724390 (O'Leary et al. 2016). Prior to submission to SWISS-MODEL, all mutations in
the crystal structures were reversed in the sequence. Using VMD (Humphrey et al. 1996), both
closed and open crystal structures were separately solvated in water boxes each having at least
12 Å cushion of water in each direction. Ions were added to neutralize the system and NaCl
concentrations were set to 0.150 M to represent a more typical biological environment. The size
of the solvated S protein systems in the closed and open states were of ~410000 and ~415000
atoms in size, respectively.
B. MD simulations
For each system, all-atom MD simulations were performed for an N, P, T ensemble in explicit
solvent (water and ions) using NAMD 2.13 (Phillips et al. 2005) package with CHARMM36
(Best et al. 2012) force field. MD Simulations were performed at 310 K temperature and 1 bar
pressure. Periodic boundary conditions were applied. Langevin dynamics was used to control
the system temperature and pressure. All atoms were coupled to the heat bath. A time step of 2
fs was used. Two minimization-equilibration cycles were applied: All steps were applied under
N, P, T conditions to relax water and find a local minimum of the whole system energy (Phillips
et al. 2003). The energy of the initial system was first minimized for 10000 steps. Water was
then equilibrated by keeping the protein fixed for 2 ns. Then, the system was minimized for
10000 steps. After the second minimization step, a harmonic constraint, which has
1 𝑘𝑐𝑎𝑙 𝑚𝑜𝑙 −1 Å−2 spring constant, was applied to each Cα of the protein for 20 ns. At the third
equilibration step, protein was released and the system was equilibrated for 5 ns. This
equilibrium step is expected to be sufficient simulate the structural differences due to the
radically different thermodynamic conditions of crystallization solutions and conventional MD
simulations (Pullara et al. 2019). Finally, production MD simulations were performed. Atomic
coordinates 𝑹 of all atoms, pressures and the energies were recorded every 10 ps. Two sets of
MD simulations were performed for each of the closed and open states of the S protein. A total
length of 800 ns of MD simulations starting from the crystal structures were performed. Table
I presents the complete list and length of each MD simulations performed in the present study.
C. Steered molecular dynamics
SMD (Isralewitz et al. 2001) is a MD simulation technique which allows to explore biological
processes on time scales accessible to MD simulations. SMD has been successfully performed
to examine a wide range of processes including molecule unbinding (Eskici and Gur 2013),
domain motion (Izrailev et al. 1999), and protein unfolding (Lu et al. 1998). The main idea of
SMD simulations is to pull the atom or atoms along a vector by applying external force. The
pulling process can be carried out at a constant speed or by applying a constant force (Phillips,
Isgro et al. 2003). Here, SMD simulations were performed using constant velocity; a dummy

atom binds with a virtual spring to the center of mass of a group of atoms called steered atoms
(SMD atoms) and is pulled along a selected pulling direction at a constant speed. The applied
force depends on the instantaneous coordinates of the center of mass of the SMD atoms, 𝐑 as
follows (Phillips, Isgro et al. 2003),

Here, 𝑈 is the potential energy, 𝐑 0 is the initial coordinates of the center of mass of SMD atoms,
𝑘 is the spring constant, 𝐯 is the pulling velocity, 𝑡 is the time instant, and 𝐧 is the direction of
pulling.
The starting and end conformations of the SMD simulations were selected from our MD
simulations of the closed and open states at time instances 20 ns and 40 ns. Cα atoms of RBD
residues P337-A344, F347-V350, W353-S371, S375-Y380, V390-I410, G416-Y423, T430S438, G447-R454, L492-Q498, Q506-L517, T523-G526 of protomer B were selected as SMD
atoms, since they show minimal deformation upon superposition of up and down RBD
conformations. In the first 20 ns of closed state MD simulations residues K986, D985 of
protomer A and K113, D985, E988 of protomer C interacted with RBD of protomer B. Thus,
their Cα atoms were kept fixed during our SMD simulations. Pulling vector was constructed by
first aligning closed and open state conformations via S2 of protomer B and subsequently
constructing a vector pointing from the center of SMD atoms in the closed state conformation
to the open state conformation. A pulling velocity of 1 Å/ns was selected and spring constant
is selected as 50 𝑘𝑐𝑎𝑙/𝑚𝑜𝑙/Å2 . These conditions satisfy stiff-spring approximation (i.e.
dummy atom followed the center of mass of SMD atoms closely), while the spring constant
was soft enough to allow small deviations (Isralewitz, Gao et al. 2001).

D. Principle component analysis
Protomer conformations sampled in MD simulations were aligned with protomer B of the open
state crystal structure using the Cα atoms of the S2 domain helices and beta sheets (Fig. S1).
Upon alignment, the covariance matrix 𝐂 was constructed using the 3x459 dimensional
configuration vector 𝐑 composed of the instantaneous Cα atom coordinates of the RBD and S2
domain helices and beta sheets as follows,
𝐂 = 〈(𝐑 − 〈𝐑〉)(𝐑 − 〈𝐑〉)T 〉

(3)

Here, 〈𝐑〉 is the trajectory average of 𝐑. Principal components (PCs) are obtained by performing
eigenvalue decomposition of 𝐂 as,
3𝑁

𝐂 = ∑ 𝜎𝑖 𝐩𝒊 𝐩𝒊 𝑇

(4)

𝑖=1

Here, 𝐩𝒊 is the ith PC and 𝜎𝑖 is the corresponding variance. Thus, 𝜎𝑖 scales with the magnitude
of motion along 𝐩𝒊 . PCs are ordered in descending order with respect to their 𝜎𝑖 values. 𝐩𝟏 (or
PC1) has the largest variance, σ1 , thus represents the most dominant motion. Similarly, PC2 is
the second most dominant motion observed in the MD trajectory.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. RBD in closed state shows less mobility than in open state, likely due to a higher
number of interdomain salt bridges
Starting from the closed and open crystal structures, two sets of MD simulations were
performed for each of the closed and open states. As shown in Fig. 2, in the open state only a
single RBD is in up position whereas for the closed state all 3 RBDs are in down position. In
accord with the crystal structure, protomers in the open state will be denoted with A, B, and C,
among which protomer B is in up conformation. Superposition of protomers in the closed state
indicate that all protomers have almost identical structures, showing root mean square deviation
(RMSD) values of ~1 Å based on the helix and beta sheet Cα atoms. Thus, each MD simulation
for the closed state will generate 3 MD simulation trajectories of the down conformation of the
protomer. In order to investigate the mobility of the RBD domain in the closed and open states
of the S protein trimer, the distance between RBD and S2 domains were tracked throughout the
MD trajectories. As shown in Fig. 3, the distribution of the distance between RBD and S2
demonstrated a significantly wider distribution in the RBD up position compared to that of the
RBD down position (in the closed state MD simulation). Standard deviations of the RBD-S2
distance distributions were 1.3 Å for the up RBD and 0.5 Å for the down RBD. Thus, RBD in
up conformation in the open state clearly shows higher mobility than RBD in down
conformation in the closed state.

FIG. 3. Distribution of the distance between RBD and S2 domain observed in MD simulations.
The normalized distribution of the interdomain distances between RBD and S2 domain is
shown for protomer B in (a) the closed state and (b) open state. The interdomain distance was
calculated by evaluating the average of the distance between the Cα atoms of residue pairs
K378(RBD)-E988(S2) and K386(RBD)-D985(S2). Distances in crystal structures are marked
with black (PDB ID: 6VXX) and magenta (PBD ID: 6VYB) stars.
Superposition of the RBD structures in the down and up position via the Cα atoms of the helices
and beta sheets shows a minimal structural difference of 0.5 Å RMSD. Furthermore, RBD
domain conformations were conserved throughout our MD simulations. Thus, based on the
crystal structures and our MD simulations it can be predicted that RBD undergoes a rigid body

motion. Since there is no noticeable structural difference between the RBD structures, the
difference in the RBD mobility in the open and closed state is expected to be caused by
differences in interdomain interactions of RBD. To this aim, interdomain salt bridges of RBD
with the remaining parts of protein were investigated in the closed and open states. Based the
closed state crystal structure, RBD forms the following three interdomain salt bridges with
residues of neighboring protomer; K378-E988 and K386-D985 with domain S2, and E516K202 with NTD. Significantly, upon performing MD simulations in the closed state the
following additional interdomain salt bridges of RBD formed with its neighboring protomers:
R408-D405 with RBD, K458-D985 with S2 domain, and K462-D198 with NTD (Fig. 2). The
distribution of the distances between the basic nitrogens and acidic oxygens of these 6
interdomain salt bridges of RBD are shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen the most prevalent salt
bridge observed in MD simulations was R408-D405. Compared to its down position, RBD
made significantly less interdomain salt bridges in its up position. Although there were no
interdomains salt bridges present for RBD of protomer B in its up conformation in the open
state crystal structure, MD simulations demonstrated the formation of the following
interdomain salt bridges of RBD of protomer B with its neighbors: D428-R403 with RBD of
protomer A, and R357-E169 and R466-E132 with NTD of protomer C. The distributions of the
distances between the basic nitrogens and acidic oxygens of these 3 salt bridges are depicted in
Fig. 4(b).

FIG. 4. Distribution of the distances between basic nitrogens and acidic oxygens of interdomain
salt bridges of RBD during MD simulations. Distribution of distances between basic nitrogens
and acidic oxygens of the indicated amino acids are provided for MD simulations in the (a)
closed state and (b) open state. For a pair of amino acids forming salt bridges, the first index
indicates the RBD amino acid whereas the second one indicates the amino acid on neighboring
protomers. The insets show the comparison for each salt bridge in closed and open states.

B. Solvent accessibility of the ACE2 binding surface of RBD is significantly higher in the
open state
Recently, the crystal structure of RBD bound to ACE2 was resolved at 2.45 Å resolution (PDB
ID: 6M0J (Lan et al. 2020)). Based on this structure, RBD amino acids K417, G446, Y449,
Y453, L455, F456, A475, F486, N487, Y489, Q493, G496, Q498, T500, N501, G502, Y505
(locations shown in Fig. 5) are interacting with ACE2. In order to investigate the solvent
accessibility of these amino acids, close contact water molecules were calculated for the closed
and open state MD simulations. To this aim, water molecules within 5 Å of the RBD amino
acids involved in ACE2 binding were evaluated for each protein conformation sampled in the
MD simulations. Notably, while the number of close contact water molecules were 433 for
RBD in up position on average, the number of close contact water molecules was only 296 for
RBD in down position of the closed state. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the RBDs of the S protein
trimer are closely packed in the closed state, hence strongly limiting water accessibility to
amino acids K417, Y453, L455, F456, and Y505. The remaining amino acids G446, Y449,
A475, F486, N487, Y489, Q493, G496, Q498, T500, N501, and G502 are solvent accessible
and could potentially be accessed by small molecules in the closed state of S protein.
Furthermore, superposition of RBD bound ACE2 structure onto the closed state S protein trimer
shows a large steric clash between ACE2 and RBD (Fig. 5(b)). Thus, making it spatially
impossible for ACE2 to bind RBD in closed state.

C. Energy landscape based on MD simulations of (starting from) closed and open S
protein trimeric structures demonstrates well defined down and up states for S protein
protomers
In order to explore the most dominant features of the protein dynamics in the closed and open
states, PCA was performed using all conformations of protomer A, B and C sampled in the
closed state MD simulations and all protomer B conformations sampled in the open state MD
simulations. PCA is an effective and proven method used to dissect the most prominent motions
of a protein along a given MD trajectory (Please refer to Sec. II D for details) (Gur et al. 2018).
For a MD trajectory of a system comprised of N atoms, PCA provides 3xN modes of motions,
among which PC1 and PC2 represent the first and second most prominent motion observed in
the MD trajectory. PC1 and PC2 obtained from the combined MD trajectory of down

conformation of protomer in closed state and up conformation of protomer in open state is
shown in Fig. 6(a). The ratio of the variances between PC1 and PC2 are 𝜎1 ⁄𝜎2 = 69.35, and
cumulatively they account for 98.6% of the total motion in the MD trajectory; i.e. the first two
PCs account for 98.6% of the total variance. As can be seen in Fig. 6(a), PC1 describes a rigid
body like motion of RBD. PC1 alone is able to describe 98% of the structural transition between
the protomer in its down an up conformation (Loop regions and NTD were not included in this
calculation). PC2 is also characterized by predominant movement of RBD.
Conformations sampled in MD simulations were projected onto PC1 and PC2. Each PC was
divided into 30 bins, hence generating an 30x30 grid system. Subsequently, based on the
occupancy of these grids, distributions of the projections 𝑓(𝐑) were computed along sets of
PCs. Lower negative values along PC1 indicate an increased level of RBD closure, whereas
higher positive values represent increased degree of RBD opening. Using distributions along
PC1 and PC2, free energy surfaces were calculated as, 𝐴(𝐑) = −𝑘𝑇𝑙𝑛 (𝑓(𝐑)) + constant
(Gur et al. 2013). The free energy surface of the S protein protomer projected on PC1 and PC2
is shown in Fig. 6(b). The free energy surface shows two distinctive energy wells, representative
of down (on the left) and up (on the right) conformational states of S protein protomer. MD
simulations starting from closed state resulted in a narrower distribution along PC2, while
distribution widths along PC1 was comparable. The region between down and up
conformational states was not sampled by the MD simulations, probably due to the inability of
MD simulations to simulate global transitions between these two states in the absence of any
bias.

D. New semi-open state emerges upon performing MD simulations starting from
intermediate conformations between down and up states of S protein protomer
In order to explore the region between the down and up states on the energy surface and
determine the minimum free energy pathway connecting these states, we performed a new
round of unbiased MD simulations starting from unpopulated regions between the down and
up states. To this aim, SMD simulations were performed starting from closed state
conformations in order to provide intermediate conformations from which new set of unbiased
MD simulations will be initiated. SMD simulations were performed by steering RBD of
protomer B towards its up position, which will be denoted with down→up. Similarly, SMD
simulations starting from open state conformations were performed pulling RBD of protomer
B towards its down position, which will be denoted with up→down. Each of down→up and
up→down SMD simulations were performed by starting from 2 separate starting conformers
sampled from the closed and open state MD simulations, respectively. Starting from S protein
conformations sampled from SMD simulations at 9 Å, 11 Å, 13 Å, 15 Å, and 17 Å along the
down→up SMD pulling direction (Table I, MD IDs 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11), and 3 Å, 5 Å and 7 Å
along the up→down SMD pulling direction (Table I, MD IDs 13, 15 and 17), a new set of 16
unbiased MD simulations were performed (Table I, MD IDs 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18).
Combining the protomer B trajectories of the new set of 1000 ns long unbiased MD simulations
with our first set of trajectories provided a total of 2250 ns of S protein protomer data to be used
for our analysis. All protomer B conformations sampled in unbiased MD simulations were

projected onto PC1 and PC2, which were obtained in the first round of MD simulations (MD12, Table I). Distribution of projections were computed and the free energy surface shown in
Fig. 6(b,c) was obtained. Free energy surface revealed a new semi-open state located halfway
across the transition between the down and up states, and a few additional substates at various
locations. The semi-open intermediate state is separated from the down and up states by energy
barriers of ~3kT. The energy barrier connecting the down and semi-open states provided a
passage significantly lowering the energy requirement to move across this barrier. For the
energy barrier between the semi-open and up states, on the other hand, three small passages,
none of which is significantly lowering the energy requirement to pass over the energy barrier,
were observed.

E. Transition between down and up states comprises a switching mechanism of salt
bridges
A minimum free energy pathway connecting the down and up states were constructed upon
following low energy regions on the energy landscape while gradually proceeding towards the
target state. The location of the conformations, which were identified to be on the minimum
free energy path, are shown in Fig. 6(c). The pathway circumvents the energy barrier between
the down and semi-open states by passing through the passage. For the transition between the
semi-open and up states the mild passage in the middle of the energy barrier was selected as the
crossing point since it was the shortest path connecting the low energy regions of the semi-open
and up states. In order to have an understanding of the behavior and contribution of salt bridge
breakage and formation during the conformational transition between the down and up state,
the transition pathway was divided into 32 bins and salt bridges of all conformations located
inside each bin were investigated. For each bin the distribution of the distance between the
acidic oxygen and basic nitrogens of amino acids pairs K378-E988, K386-D985, E516-K202,
R408-D405, K458-D985, K462-D198, R357-E169, D428-R403, and R466-E132 were
evaluated. The bin averages of distances are depicted in Fig. 7. It is to be noted that standard
deviations of distances are not shown in Fig. 7. As can be seen in distributions of Fig. 4, for the
listed interactions, the salt bridge forming requirement of acidic oxygen and basic nitrogens to
be closer than 6 Å is not satisfied throughout the trajectory, yet strong interactions are conserved
even at slightly higher distance. Thus, if conformers inside a bin are forming salt bridges
frequently and otherwise strong interactions are preserved for the amino acid pairs, we will
refer to this bin as a salt bridge forming bin for the sake of conciseness of the discussion.
As can be seen from the distance distributions in Fig. 7, during the closed to semi-open
transition, the salt bridge R408-D405 with RBD of protomer A is formed, and K458-D985 with
S2 of chain A, K378-E988 with S2 of protomer C and K462-D198 with NTD of protomer C
are broken. The closed to semi-open transition takes place by passing through a substate, which
differentiates from the down state by the formation of R408-D405 and breakage of K378-E988
and K458-D985. This switch in salt bridges is probably the reason why this substate is observed
along the transition between the closed and semi-open state. Transition from this substate into
the semi-open state comprises breakage of K462-D198 with NTD of protomer C. Significantly,
crossing the energy barrier, which separates the semi-open state from the up state, to settle into

the up state requires the breakage of 3 salt bridges; K386-D985 with S2 of protomer C, R408D405 with RBD of protomer A, and E516-K202 of NTD of protomer C; and formation of two
salt bridges; R466-E132 with NTD of protomer C and D428-R403 with RBD of protomer A.
Salt bridge R357-E169 with NTD of protomer C is formed later on along the transition pathway,
probably further stabilizing the up state.

FIG. 7. Time evolution of salt bridges during the transition between the down and up
conformations. Distance changes between the basic nitrogens and acidic oxygens throughout
MD simulations for the salt bridges observed in the (a) down and (b) up states.

IV. CONCLUSION
MD simulations of the closed and open states show that the RBD in its up position shows higher
mobility than RBD in its down position in the closed state. Analysis of the interdomain salt
bridges of RBD suggest that the reason behind the higher mobility is the significantly lower
number of interdomain salt bridges that RBD is forming in its up position. Interestingly,
although solvent accessibility of the ACE2 binding interface of RBD is significantly limited in
the closed state, there is still a significant amount accessible to the solvent. In fact, out of 17
amino acids of the ACE2 binding interface in RBD, 12 are solvent accessible in the closed state.
This is a significant finding, as it potentially implicates that small molecule binding to inhibit
the S protein in its closed state could be theoretically possible. Superposition of the ACE2
bound RBD structures clearly shows that it would be impossible for the S protein to bind ACE2
in its closed state. Thus, in contrast to an inhibitor binding to the open state, an inhibitor binding
to the closed state would not need to compete with ACE2 for the binding interface. Energy
landscapes based on our MD simulations suggest the existence of an intermediate semi-open
state for the S protein, in which RBD of one protomer is halfway between its down and up
positions. This semi-open state shows a distinct salt bridge network from the down and up
states, and it remains to be explored whether this semi-open state could potentially be an
effective drug binding target for therapeutics. Taken all together, our study provides unique
atomic-level insight into the dynamics, interactions, and the solvent accessibility of the ACE2
binding surface of the S protein in its closed and open states. Moreover, conformational details
and energetics of the down to up transition, which effectively puts the S protein in an active
form, were explored. This extensive novel insight regarding S protein structure, dynamics, and
energetics is expected to support the global drug and vaccine development efforts.
