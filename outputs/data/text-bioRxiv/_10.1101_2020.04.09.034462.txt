Here we aim to describe early mutational events across samples from publicly available SARSCoV-2 sequences from the sequence read archive repository. Up until March 27, 2020, we
downloaded 53 illumina datasets, mostly from China, USA (Washington DC) and Australia
(Victoria). Of 30 high quality datasets, 27 datasets (90%) contain at least a single founder
mutation and most of the variants are missense (over 63%). Five-point mutations with clonal
(founder) effect were found in USA sequencing samples. Sequencing samples from USA in
GenBank present this signature with 50% allele frequencies among samples. Australian mutation
signatures were more diverse than USA samples, but still, clonal events were found in those
samples. Mutations in the helicase and orf1a coding regions from SARS-CoV-2 were
predominant, among others, suggesting that these proteins are prone to evolve by natural
selection. Finally, we firmly urge that primer sets for diagnosis be carefully designed, since
rapidly occurring variants would affect the performance of the reverse transcribed quantitative
PCR (RT-qPCR) based viral testing.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by a novel 2019 SARS coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2,
is rapidly evolving worldwide, surpassing the 8000 total cases of 2002-2004 SARS coronavirus
outbreak (SARS-CoV-1) after one month of the initially identified case on December 31, 2019,
in Wuhan city, China (Wilder-Smith et al. 2020). As SARS-CoV-2 is human-to-human
transmitted, it is a threat to the global population. It is critical to understand SARS-CoV-2
characteristics to deal with this ongoing pandemic and to develop future treatments. SARS-CoV2 virus is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus with a large genome (29.9 kb) belonging to
the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales (de Wit et al. 2016). One of the striking genomic
features of this novel virus is the presence of a novel furin-like cleavage site in the S-protein of
the virus, which differs from SARS-CoV-1 and may have implications for the life cycle and
pathogenicity of the novel virus (Coutard et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020a). Firstly, it was suggested
that SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the RaTG13 bat-derived coronavirus (around 88%
identity) rather than of SARS-CoV-1 (79% identity) or middle east respiratory syndrome
coronavirus MERS-CoV (50% identity) (Lu et al. 2020). Due to this association with bat
coronaviruses, it was also argued that SARS-CoV-2 virus has the potential to spread into another
species, as bat coronaviruses do (Hu et al. 2018). Recently, it was demonstrated that SARS-CoV2 is closely related to a pangolin coronavirus (Pangolin-CoV) found in dead Malayan pangolins
with a 91.02% identity, the closest relationship found so far for SARS-CoV-2 (Zhang et al.
2020). In that study, genomic analyses revealed that the S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is related
closer to SARS-CoV-2 than to RaTG13 coronavirus. Also, five key amino acid residues involved
in the interaction with the human ACE2 receptor are maintained in Pangolin-CoV and SARSCoV-2, but not in RaTG13 coronavirus. Thus, it is likely that pangolin species are a natural
reservoir of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 will continue to evolve with
novel mutations, as the pandemic evolves. In this scenario, it is expected that diverse signatures
of viral variants spread among different populations in the world. Recently, thousands of
GenBank sequences from SARS-CoV-19 available at the NCBI virus database were trackable by
region, suggesting that the transmission occurred mainly through clonal events due to clustering
of the available sequences (Chen et al. 2020; Kupferschmidt 2020)
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?SeqType_s=Protein&VirusLineage_ss=S
ARS-CoV-2,%20taxid:2697049). As a proof of concept, in the early beginning of the outbreak in
China, sequencing the virus from nine patients from Wuhan in China revealed 99.9% similarity
among samples. That finding suggests 2019-nCoV originated from one source within a very
short time, supporting clonality of spreading (Lu et al. 2020). In this study, we characterized the
early mutational events across 30 high-quality datasets publicly available on the sequence read
archive repository. 27 out of 30 samples (90%) contain at least a single founder mutation and
most of the variants across samples are missense (over 63%). Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2
variants in USA samples display a clonal pattern of acquired mutations, that are dissimilar to
Australian SARS-CoV-2 mutations, which were found to be heterogeneous. A mutational

signature from USA mutations was however found in an Australian sample, suggesting a worldwide spread of this molecular signature consisting of five-point mutations. Remarkably,
mutations in the helicase and orf1a proteins of the virus were found more frequently than others,
suggesting that these proteins are prone to evolve throughout natural selection. As proof of the
latter, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in an Australian sample causes a bona-fide stop
codon in the helicase protein, strongly suggest this protein will evolve on SARS-CoV-2 in the
future. As genetic drift prompts the mutational spectrum of the virus, we recommend frequently
sequencing the viral pool in every country to detect the founder events relevant for SARS-CoV-2
testing in each population

Materials & Methods
Data Collection
Raw illumina sequencing data were downloaded from the following NCBI SRA BioProjects:
SRA: PRJNA601736 (Chinese datasets), SRA: PRJNA603194 (Chinese dataset) (Wu et al.
2020b), SRA: PRJNA605907 (Chinese datasets) (Shen et al. 2020), SRA: PRJNA607948 (USAWisconsin datasets), SRA: PRJNA608651 (Nepal dataset), SRA: PRJNA610428 (USAWashington datasets), SRA: PRJNA612578 (USA-San-Diego dataset), SRA: PRJNA231221
(USA-Washington dataset) (Sichtig et al. 2019), SRA: PRJNA613958 (Australian-Victoria
datasets), SRA: PRJNA231221 (USA-Maryland dataset), and SRA: PRJNA614995 (USA-Utah
datasets). All SRA accessions are depicted in Supplementary Table 1, sheet 1.
Data processing
Raw reads were aligned with bowtie2 aligner (v2.2.6) (Langmead & Salzberg 2012) against
SARS-CoV-2 reference genome NC_045512.2
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512), using the following parameters: -D 20 -R
3 -N 0 -L 20 -i S,1,0.50. Samtools v1.9 (using htslib v1.9) (Li et al. 2009) was used to sort sam
files, remove duplicate reads and index bam files. bcftools v1.9 (part of the samtools framework)
was used to obtain depth of coverage in each aligned sample. For variant calling from each
sample, bcftools mpileup was used with the following parameters: -B -C 50 -d 250. To obtain
founder mutations, strict filtering of called variants was performed with bcftools filter,
considering variants only with Mann-Whitney U test of read position bias over 0.1 and the
number of high-quality reference alleles divided by high-quality alternate alleles over 0.3. All
commands to obtain these computational steps are publicly available at
https://github.com/cfarkas/SARS-CoV-19_illumina_analysis.
SNVs consequences and classification
All SNP and INDELs consequences were assessed in each sample by using snippy haploid
variant calling and core genome alignment pipeline: https://github.com/tseemann/snippy.

Construction of multiple sequence alignments with GenBank sequences.
436 GenBank SAR2-CoV-2 submitted fasta sequences were downloaded on March 31, 2020,
from NCBI virus database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/) using as query
“Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), taxid:2697049”. These
sequences were aligned and processed with the same steps as we did with the fastq datasets. (see
Data processing section and “Alignment of GenBank Sequences, March 31, 2020” in
https://github.com/cfarkas/SARS-CoV-19_illumina_analysis).
Primer List obtention
CDC primers currently in use (April 2020) were obtained from
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.html, generated by
the Division of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA. University of Hong-Kong
primers currently in use from the were obtained from https://www.who.int/docs/defaultsource/coronaviruse/peiris-protocol-16-1-20.pdf?sfvrsn=af1aac73_4 and Institute Pasteur
primers currently in use were obtained based on the first sequences of SARS-CoV-2 made
available on the GISAID database (Shu & McCauley 2017) on January 11, 2020, available here:

Results
Inspection of variants reveals well-defined signatures with founder effect across sequenced
samples.
We downloaded 53 raw datasets from the sources referred in Material and Methods (see
Supplementary Table 1, sheet 1) and we aligned fastq reads against SARS-CoV-2 reference
genome NC_045512.2, corresponding to the initial isolate Wuhan-Hu-1. Out of 53 total datasets,
only 30 displayed coverage over 30X, suitable for the variant calling framework, which we
subsequently analyzed in depth. We also manually checked the coverage of each sample by
using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) tool (Robinson et al. 2011). Variant calling reveals
a diverse number of variants in each sample, which were strictly filtered to obtain founder
mutations in each sample (see Material and Methods). Five datasets from Chinese origin were
selected after coverage filtering and only two of them displayed founder mutations (see
Supplementary Table 1, sheet 1). Fourteen datasets from the USA were filtered (USAWashington study, hereafter referred as USA-WA) and remarkably, all of them displayed
variants presenting a defined mutational signature, consisting in a core of five founder mutations
at positions 8782, 17747, 17858, 18060 and 28144 of the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (see

Figure 1A, Supplementary Table 1, sheet 1). Mutational landscape of SARS-CoV-2 samples in
Australia (Australia-Victoria samples, hereafter Australia-VIC) was clearly heterogeneous,
displaying a variety of founder mutations per sample but also shared variants were observed
within samples. One variant (position 26144) is present in 5/11 Australia-VIC samples and
variants with positions 8782 and 28144 are present in 3/11 Australian samples (see Figure 1A,
Supplementary Table 1, sheet 1). Notably, one Australian-VIC sample (SRR11397717)
displayed the same five-point mutational signature of USA-WA samples, two samples contain
the same mutational signature presenting one deletion (SRR11397715 and SRR11397716) and
one novel signature (SRR11397728) presents an SNP that creates a stop codon (see Figure 1A,
respectively). All of these called variants present mutant allele frequencies near or equal to
100%, evidenced in the number of mutant_alleles / reference_alleles (see mutant allele frequency
in Supplementary Table 1, sheet 2 and 3, respectively) easily visualized in the aligned bam files
(see Figure 1B from USA-WA and Australian-VIC samples, respectively). These analyses
suggest these variants were already spread in the infected population in the early days of the
outbreak, they are not restricted by country and that they will continue to spread along with the
growing cases. To support the latter, we downloaded 436 GenBank sequences of SARS-CoV-2
available in NCBI virus database from different countries and we aligned them with the SARSCoV-2 reference genome. Variant calling from these alignment reveals the substantial presence
of these USA-WA signature, with allele frequencies ranging 37-46% (see Figure 1B, bottom and
Supplementary Table 1, sheet 4). Thus, the USA-WA signature is widespread among SARSCoV-2 infections likely due to founder effect. To figure out whether this signature is enriched in
USA samples, we performed the same analysis in a subset of 277 sequences, all of them from
USA origin. As expected, the USA-WA signature consisting of five-point mutations are enriched
in allele frequencies over 50% plus (see Supplementary Table 1, sheet 5). Also, in these 277
sequences, six more variants were detected with smaller allele frequencies as reported for USAWA variants. It is expected that these variants also will rise among infected people in the USA as
the USA-WA signature did. A summary of the USA-WA mutational signature is depicted in
Table 1.
Classification of founder mutations
Classification of variants performed by snippy tool analysis reveals that most of the referred
variants in USA-WA and Australia-VIC samples are preferentially missense (63% for USA-WA
samples and 74% for Australia-VIC samples, respectively) rather than synonymous (see Figure
2A, Supplementary Table 1, sheets 2 and 3, respectively). Focusing on missense variants of
USA-WA signature, the most recurrent mutations occurred in the helicase, 3'-to-5' exonuclease
and ORF8 protein, accounting for the 81% of missense variants in this signature (see Figure 2B,
Supplementary Table 1, sheet 2). These mutations correspond to the five core point mutations
observed in USA-WA samples. In the case of Australia-VIC missense samples, the scenario is
more complex, due to the heterogeneity of the signatures. Mutations in the orf1a polyprotein,

ORF3a protein, helicase and surface glycoprotein account for 69% of the missense variants
present in the Australia-VIC signatures. Importantly, two Australian samples (SRR11397715 and
SRR11397716) present the same mutational profiling with deletions in the stem loop of the virus
and notably, one sample (SRR11397728) presents an SNP that created a stop codon in the
helicase protein (see Supplementary Table 1, sheet 3). Since every USA-WA and AustraliaVIC sample that presents variants in the helicase gene contains at least one missense variant, this
evidence strongly suggests that this gene is under active evolution it will likely continue to
evolve along with SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
SNPs in SARS-CoV-2 can diminish efficiency of RT-qPCR testing.
We downloaded the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention primer list, consisting of three
primer sets designed against ORF9 structural protein (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein), each one
with a fluorescent probe for reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (see
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.html and
https://github.com/cfarkas/SARS-CoV-19_illumina_analysis, file CDC_primers.fasta). We
investigated if these primers hybridized at positions with the variants reported herein from the 30
next-generation sequencing datasets. We aligned these primer sequences with SARS-CoV-2
reference genome and the 30 analyzed samples. We found two Australian clonal samples
(SRR11397719 and SRR11397721) presenting one founder synonymous SNP (position 28688)
that falls into the 2019_nCoV_N2_Forward_Primer hybridization region. In the first sample, we
also found an SNP with low allele frequency that falls into the 2019-nCoV_N1_Reverse_Primer
(see Figure 3). We also challenged a list of primers available from literature (16), primers
currently used for the Institute Pasteur, Hong Kong University and ten primers obtained from
primer-blast (see Material and Methods for sources) against 206 variants consisting in GenBank
variants collected from USA samples including variants from the next-generation sequencing
datasets employed here (see Supplementary Table 1, sheet 6). Of these, CDC primer set 2019nCoV_N3 forward and reverse along with its probe were discarded again, due to potential
reduced efficiency during priming. Similarly, sets 2, 3 and 8 from primer-blast, were discarded.
Conversely, primers from Pasteur Institute and Hong-Kong university passed the filter,
respectively. Thus, increasing variation in SARS-CoV-2 can confound quantitative RT-qPCR in
the future depending on the primer design.

Since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that rapidly evolves after infection, these evolutionary
events will likely affect its fitness over time. In this study, we reveal the early mutational events
in small samples from mainly two geographically unrelated populations (Washington, USA, and
Victoria, Australia) and we compared these results with variants observed in submitted GenBank
sequences in NCBI viral portal, from different countries. As already reported with HIV and
Chikungunya outbreaks, the founder effect of five-point mutations was observed in almost all
USA-WA samples obtained by next-generation sequencing. These mutations also have a high
allele frequency (around 50%) in SARS-CoV-2 GenBank sequences from USA origin (Foley et
al. 2000; Tsetsarkin et al. 2011). These mutational signatures are likely to be overrepresented
among Washington infections and USA infections overall, if not globally. Supporting this, the
alignment of 435 submitted sequences to NCBI virus from different countries (March 31, 2020)
shows allele frequencies of 37-46% of these five SNPs across samples worldwide. These SNPs
cause missense mutations on helicase, 3'-to-5' exonuclease and ORF8 proteins. In the case of
Victoria samples from Australia, samples ranging from one single SNP up to eleven were found.
In the early beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan city (between December 18-29, 2019), one to
four mutations arose in the virus per patient (Shen et al. 2020), arguing that the number of fixed
mutations in the world population is rapidly increasing where the infection has spread.
Importantly, one Australian sample sequenced by next generation sequencing presented the
USA-WA signature, suggesting that this signature is already propagated with the worldwide
pandemic. Clonal mutational events within Australian samples were also observed and probably
are widespread in the region. One interesting feature of the mutations in this limited number of
samples is the evolutionary pressure undergone helicase gene. RNA helicases display various
functions in genome replication, and it has been proposed as a therapeutic target to inhibit
coronaviruses among other viruses with small molecules (Briguglio et al. 2011). Helicase
evolution in SARS-CoV-2 could be rapidly occurring, making it unfeasible to drug this protein
in the future. As genetic drift is allowing SARS-CoV-2 to evolve while the pandemic is still
growing, the amplification efficiency of quantitative RT-qPCR tests is challenged since a single
mutation even in the middle of a primer can be detrimental for PCR efficiency (Bru et al. 2008),
potentially contributing to false negative results in COVID-19 testing. For this issue, we
provided a way to compute the latter, by merging all variant sites called across studied samples
and intersect them across primer sets available both in literature and currently in use. As new
mutations can be spread depending on the founder effect, we firmly urge that primer sets for
clinical testing should be tested in this way continuously, according to the current mutations
found at the particular time and in the specific population which needs to be diagnosed with
SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We described the early mutational events in SARS-CoV-2 virus by inspecting sequencing
samples from China, USA, Australia and GenBank sequenced submitted until March 31, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 variants from USA display five-point mutations with clonal (founder) pattern of
spreading and considerable high allele frequencies in the next-generation sequencing samples.
The latter was verified in SARS-CoV-2 sequences submitted to GenBank, since these five-point
mutations displayed alleles frequencies of 50% among all USA GenBank SARS-CoV-2
sequences (n=277). SARS-CoV-2 Australian mutations were heterogeneous, but still, clonal
events were found. RT-qPCR efficiency testing can be potentially affected by founder mutations,
since several SNPs affects one of three primers sets currently used in COVID-19 testing.
