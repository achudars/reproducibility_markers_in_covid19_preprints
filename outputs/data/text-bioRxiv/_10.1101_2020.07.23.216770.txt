Abstract
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic severely challenges public health and
necessitates the need for increasing our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, especially
host factors facilitating virus infection and propagation. Here, the co-expression network was
constructed by mapping the well-known ACE2, TMPRSS2 and host susceptibility genes
implicated in COVID-19 GWAS onto a cornea, retinal pigment epithelium and lung. We
found a significant co-expression module of these genes in the cornea, revealing that cornea is
potential extra-respiratory entry portal of SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, both co-expression and
interaction networks show a significant enrichment in mitochondrial function, which are the
hub of cellular oxidative homeostasis, inflammation and innate immune response. We
identified a corneal mitochondrial susceptibility module (CMSM) of 14 mitochondrial genes
by integrating ACE2 co-expression cluster and SARS-CoV-2 interactome. Gene ECSIT, as a
cytosolic adaptor protein involved in inflammatory responses, exhibits the strongest
correlation with ACE2 in CMSM, which has shown to be an important risk factor for
SARS-CoV-2 infection and prognosis. Our co-expression and protein interaction network
analysis uncover that the mitochondrial function related genes in cornea contribute to the
dissection of COVID-19 susceptibility and potential therapeutic interventions.

Introduction
A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
associated with severe human infected disease (COVID-19) outbreak starting from December
2019, in China, and the disease is quickly spreading worldwide (1). Despite being primarily a
respiratory virus, COVID-19 can also present with non-respiratory signs, including ocular
symptoms as conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, increased secretions, ocular pain,
photophobia and dry eye (2). The presence of virus in tear, conjunctival swab specimens and
animal models of infectious increasing clinical and scientific evidence that eye may serve as a
potential site of virus replication (3, 4). Moreover, immunohistochemical studies and
single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets revealed both extra- and intra-ocular localisation of
SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, ACE receptor and TMPRSS2 protease in human eyes (5, 6).
Together, these results suggest that ocular surface cells are susceptible to infection by
SARS-CoV-2. More a recent GWAS study identified 3p21.31 as a most significant genetic
locus being associated with COVID-19 induced respiratory failure (7). This locus covers a
cluster of six genes consisting of SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6, and XCR1,
with the identified risk allele being associated with increased SLC6A20 and LZTFL1
expression. Of note, SLC6A20, LZTFL and FYCO1 is known to associate with eye
development, electroretinography abnormal and anterior eye segment morphology. However,
whether these key factors for cellular susceptibility to viral infection have correlation in
ocular surface cell remains unclear. Herein, we constructed co-expression and interactome
networks and mapped genes implicated by COVID-19 GWAS onto corneal co-expression
network to infer the function of susceptibility gene.

Results
To understand the expression patterns of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and susceptibility genes in cornea,
we firstly compared the expression level of ACE2 in cornea, retina, RPE and lung tissues
based on bulk RNA sequencing. As expected from prior literature (8), the cornea showed a
higher ACE2 expression than lung both in terms of their TPM values (Fig 1A). ACE2
exhibits the highest co-expression correlation with TMPRSS2, SLC6A20C and LZTFL1 in
the cornea compared to lung and RPE (Fig. 1B). To gain more insight into the biological
network of genes associated with SARS-CoV-2 entry factors and susceptibility gene, we
performed k-means clustering algorithm to identify genes associated with ACE2 on cornea
datasets (Fig. 1C). We identified 26 co-expression modules ranging in size from 111 to 1798
genes. One cluster contained both ACE2, LZTFL1 and FYCO1 (cluster 7; 1434 genes). The
strongest correlation with the eigengene (the principal component) of this ACE2 cluster was
found for hub genes STK16 (r=0.95, p=1.07×10-9), a member of NAK family that activate the
AP 2 scaffolding protein vital to viral entry and propagation. TMPRSS2 belonged to a
separate cluster 5 (603 genes) with hub gene SLC25A1 (r=0.91, p=4.45×10-8), which
involved in TNF-α and IFN-γ triggered inflammation. Together these data suggest that the
cornea may provide a susceptibility and entry portal for the SARS-CoV-2 entry.
To gain insights into the molecular functionality related to ACE2 cluster, we integrated
the ACE2 cluster and SARS-CoV-2 interactome and observed their shared a number of
similarities. For instance, the ACE2 cluster and SARS-CoV-2 interactome eigengenes were
highly correlated (r=0.56, p=0.014). Genes within ACE2 cluster were mainly related to
mitochondrion functions such as mitochondrial inner membrane and mitochondrial electron

transport (p=7.47×10-29) (Fig. 2A). We further evaluated shared GO enrichments to determine
whether the similarity in the behavior meant that both clusters contained functionally related
genes. ACE2 cluster and SARS-CoV-2 interactome were nominally enriched (p value <0.001)
for 41 and 35 GO terms, respectively. Of these, 17 terms were enriched in both modules.
Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation in fold enrichments for shared terms (Fig.
2B). Most of the ontologies shared between the modules described cellular components,
biological processes, and molecular functions pertinent to mitochondrion (Fig. 2B). In both
the ACE2 cluster and SARS-CoV-2 interactome, the observed numbers of mitochondrial
genes were significantly higher than the number what would be expected by chance
(p=2.1×10-14 and p=3.2×10-6, respectively; Fig. 2C). In addition, we found the observed
number of ACE2 cluster that was significantly higher (p = 0.005) associated with interaction
protein of SARS-CoV-2 compared to randomness (Fig. 2C). Together, these results indicated
that ACE2 cluster possess the key factors required for cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2
infection in cornea. Therefore, the core 14 genes were co-occurred in all three datasets as the
corneal mitochondrial susceptibility module (CMSM) of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cornea
(Fig. 2D). Of the 14 CMSM genes, five genes have been shown to directly implicate in the
function of electron transport. They include genes such as NDUFB9 a member of
mitochondrial respiratory-chain complex 1, and NDUFAF1, NDUFAF2, ECSIT which are
involved in mitochondrial respiratory-chain complex 1 assembly. Next, we studied the
expression alteration of these genes in cornea from 23 keratoconus patients and 19 health
controls. We found that ACE2 expression was significantly increased in keratoconus
compared to control cornea (log2FC=2.8, p=4.4×10-7; Fig. 2E). Other than the up-regulation

of ACE2 in keratoconus, there were 10 of 21 genes related to SARS-CoV-2 infection was
significantly upregulated in keratoconus patients (Fig. 2E, t-test p-value < 0.05). Based on the
elevated expression of ACE2 and other susceptibility genes in keratoconus, we speculated
that patients with keratoconus are more likely to be infected by the SARS-CoV-2.
Discussion
To control and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is vital to gain greater
understanding of the routes and modes of transmission, including the role of the ocular
surface. Using a cornea-relevant co-expression network to inform virus entry factors and
GWAS interpretation, we were able to identify putative susceptibility genes for highly
correlated with ACE2. Interestingly, we found that ACE2 co-expression cluster and
SARS-CoV-2 interactome were both enriched for processes to respiratory electron transport
which are being targeted by metformin. A favourable effect of metformin in patients with
COVID-19 has been hypothesised as the drug might prevent virus entry into target cells via

and

the

phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase–protein kinase B-mammalian target of rapamycin signalling

susceptibility genes based on the co-expression and protein interaction network. Notably,
ECSIT, one of the CMSC gene, is a cytosolic adaptor protein involved in inflammatory
responses and plays a regulatory role as part of the TAK1-ECSIT-TRAF6 complex that is
involved in the activation of NF-κB by the TLR4 signal. In the previous study, treatment with
drugs that inhibited NF-κB activation led to a reduction in inflammation and significantly
increased mouse survival after SARS-CoV infection (10). Additionally, ECSIT is also

essential for the association of RIG-I-like receptors (RIG-I or MDA5) to VISA in innate
antiviral responses. Therefore, ECSIT may be used as a new drug target to protect against the
development of severe forms of COVID-19 infection. Based on our results, we believe that
significant insight into COVID-19 in cornea can be gained using co-expression and
interaction networks.
Materials and Methods
We collected and analyzed the several RNA-seq studies of the normal tissue of cornea (n=19
samples) (11), retina (n=310 samples), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (n=207 samples) (12)
and lung (n = 546 samples) from the NCBI GEO database (GSE77938 and GSE115828) and
GTEx database. To specifically characterize the biological pathways involved, we performed
k-means analysis, identifying several co-expression clusters. For further information about
