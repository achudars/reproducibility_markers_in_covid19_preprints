Abstract
Since 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected ten
millions of people across the globe, and massive mutations in virus
genome have occurred during the rapid spread of this novel coronavirus.
Variance in protein sequence might lead to change in protein structure
and interaction, then further affect the viral physiological characteristics,
which could bring tremendous influence on the pandemic.

In this study,

we investigated 18 non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome
which incidence rates were all ≥1% as of July 15th, 2020, then modeled
the mutated protein structures and compared them with the reference
ones.

The results showed that four types of mutations could cause

dramatic changes in protein structures (RMSD ≥5.0 Å), which were Q57H
and G251V in open reading frames 3a (ORF3a), S194L and R203K/G204R
in nucleocapsid (N). Next, we found that these mutations could affect
the binding affinity of intraviral protein interactions.

In addition, the hot

spots within these docking complexes were altered, among which the
mutation Q57H was involved in both Orf3a-Orf8 and Orf3a-S protein
interactions.

Besides, these mutations were widely distributed all over

the world, and their occurrences fluctuated as time went on. Notably,
the incidences of R203K/G204R in N and Q57H in Orf3a were both over 50%
in some countries. Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2
mutations can change viral protein structure, binding affinity and hot
spots of the interface, thereby may have impacts on SARS-CoV-2
transmission, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.

Introduction
The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been
characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of
July 15th, 2020, there were a total of 13,150,645 confirmed cases and 574,464
deaths all over the world.

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded

RNA virus and belongs to Betacoronavirus [1], which genome is comprised of
~30,000 nucleotides, containing twelve open reading frames (ORFs) encoding
four structural and twenty-two non-structural proteins. The structural proteins
include spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and
nucleocapsid protein (N), while the non-structural proteins (nsp) contain
nsp1~16 encoded by ORF1ab, and six accessory proteins which are Orf3a, 6,
7a, 7b, 8, and 9b [2]. It is reported that the evolution rate of a typical RNA
virus is about 10−4 substitutes per year per site [3], and mutations could occur
during each replication cycle.

Published data also suggested that single

nucleotide variants (SNVs) in SARS-CoV-2 genome were quite abundant.
Hence, it would be important to find out all the mutations with relatively high
incidences and investigate their potential impact on virus characteristics.
Non-synonymous mutations cause amino acid substitutions, and could
alter virus protein structures, which may affect viral reproduction, leading to
false-negative diagnoses and drug resistance.

It is reported that the

depletion of nine amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 resulted in a dramatic
alteration of protein structure and caused a shift in its transmembrane
localization, which would lead to drug resistance of interferon (IFN) [4].
Additionally, along with the occurrence of S139A and F140A mutations, the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.15.241349; this version posted August 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro altered remarkably, followed by the decrease
of its enzyme activity [5].

Furthermore, alteration of protein structure by

mutations also can affect protein-protein binding, and intraviral protein-protein
interactions are indispensable in assembly and release of coronavirus.

In

SARS-CoV, the interactions between structural proteins are essential for its
maturation [6], while the binding between non-structural proteins guarantees
the completion of virus replication [7].

Y195A mutation in SARS-CoV M was

found to disrupt its interaction with S, resulting in a declined ability of virus
assembly [8].

However, it is still not clear whether some SARS-CoV-2

mutations lead to the changes of protein structures and protein-protein
interactions, which could affect protein function, virus infection, and even
clinical antiviral strategy.

Hence, it is very important and urgent to find out

SARS-CoV-2 mutations, especially the ones with high occurrence rate, that
may result in the changes of virus characteristics.
In this report, we selected non-synonymous mutations of SARS-CoV-2
with ≥1% incidence, predicted and compared the structures of their
corresponding proteins, and found that four types of mutations had significant
impacts on protein structures, which resulted in remarkable changes in binding
affinities and hot spots between virus proteins.

Besides, statistical analyses

on mutation rates exhibited dynamic changes in the process of time, and also
demonstrated these four SARS-CoV-2 variants were widely distributed and
had relatively high incidences in certain countries.

Thus, our findings on

SARS-CoV-2 mutations would be very helpful for better understandings about
this virus and dealing with the complicated situations in COVID-19 prevention,
diagnosis and treatment.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 mutations led to altered protein structures
As the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading around the world, thousands of
SARS-CoV-2 mutations have been evolved.

To investigate these

SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide polymorphisms, first we took one of the earliest
reported SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (GenBank accession number:
MN908947.3) as a control. Next, from CNCB 2019nCoVR database (see
Methods), we selected 18 mutations with frequency ≥1% among all
non-synonymous mutations, as of July 15th, 2020, which were located in ten
different SARS-CoV-2 protein-coding regions (Table S1). Specifically, there
was one amino acid substitution in nsp2, nsp3, nsp5, nsp6 or S.

Meanwhile,

two single substitutions were observed in nsp12, nsp13, Orf3a or Orf8, among
which mutation P323L in nsp12 had the highest incidence (41.62%), and four
single ones were found in N. In particular, there were also some combined
mutations, such as P504L/Y541C in nsp13, and R203K/G204R in N (Table S1).
Briefly, there were 15 types of mutants composed of 18 mutations with ≥1%
incidence, which included one nsp2, nsp3, nsp5, nsp6, nsp13 or S mutant, two
nsp12, Orf3 or Orf8 mutants, and three N mutants.
To examine whether these mutations had effects on protein structure,
we predicted three-dimensional (3D) structures of each mutant and its
reference protein using I-TASSER (Table S1) [9]. The structural similarity
between mutant and control protein were compared using TM-align [10].
After structural alignment, we found that four mutants exhibited significant
difference in protein structural morphology from their control ones (RMSD ≥5.0
Å), which were Q57H Orf3a, G251V Orf3a, S194L N, R203K/G204R N,

respectively (Fig. 1 and Table S1).

SARS-CoV-2 mutations resulted in the changes in protein-protein
interactions
The SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been shown to display characteristic
SARS-CoV features [11, 12].

So here, we referenced SARS-CoV protein

combinations and explored the effect of these mutations which caused the
alterations of protein structure on intraviral SARS-CoV-2 protein interaction
known as a rate-limited procedure for virus reproduction [13-16]. Among 16
mutant docking pairs, five mutant complexes had significantly higher binding
affinity than control ones (Fig. 2). Differently, another four mutant pairs
showed weakened binding affinity in comparison with the control, and there
was no obvious change in the remaining seven groups which absolute values
of ΔΔG (= ΔGcontrol - ΔGmutant) were less than 1 kcal/mol (Fig. 2). Strikingly,
binding affinity of Q57H Orf3a-S complex showed the greatest increased (ΔΔG
= 4.2 kcal/mol), while the most dramatic decrease was observed in binding
affinity of G251V Orf3a-M complex (ΔΔG = -2.3 kcal/mol) (Fig. 2A). Moreover,
in the process of Orf3a interacting with M or S, Q57H mutant pairs showed
enhanced binding affinity, while G251V mutant pairs had attenuated ones as
just mentioned (Fig. 2A), suggesting that diverse amino acid substitutions in
the same protein could lead to different effect on binding affinity.

SARS-CoV-2 mutations caused varied hot spots within protein
complexes

Hot spots are functional sites within protein-interacting interfaces, which are
conservative and often taken as attractive drug targets via preventing
protein-protein interactions. To further study the influence of SARS-CoV-2
mutations on protein binding hot spots, we predicted the hot spots in nine
mutated complexes with altered bind affinity using the KFC2 server (Figs. 3, 4
and S1). Surprisingly, the results showed that the binding hot spots on
mutated protein-protein interfaces were notably different from control ones,
and few identical hot spots were shared by both the mutant and control
complexes.

In particular, amino acid substitution Q57H was a hot spot in

Orf3a-Orf8 and Orf3a-S complexes, but Q57 residue in control Orf3a was not
involved in the protein binding interfaces (Figs. 3B and 4A). These results
indicated that SARS-CoV-2 mutations might destroy drug targeting sites and
lead to therapy failure by shifting protein-binding interface.

SARS-CoV-2 mutations were globally distributed with dynamic
incidences over time
The changes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins caused by mutations can affect virus
transmission, pathogenesis and immunogenicity.

And with the spread of this

pandemic, the incidence and lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infection varied from
country to country.

Hence, to link SARS-CoV-2 mutations and COVID-19

prevalence for controlling the pandemic, we analyzed the occurrence of these
four types of mutations (Q57H and G251V in Orf3a, S194L and R203K/ G204R
in N) based on CNCB 2019nCoVR database. To avoid deviation caused by
insufficient sample size, we screened out the countries or regions where the
number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences submitted was no more than 100,

as of July 15th, 2020. The statistical results showed that high mutated
incidence areas were distributed all over the world except Antarctica with the
dynamic occurrences over time (Fig. 5).

The frequency of all these mutations

were relatively high in some countries (Fig. 5).

Among them, we noticed that

the incidence of R203K/G204R in N was as high as 85.44% in Bengal,
meanwhile, it was also over 50% in Russia or Greece, with a trend
of escalation (Fig. 5D). Analogously, the frequency of Q57H in Orf3a in Saudi
Arabia, Finland and Denmark was shown the high incidences, which were
73.38%, 69.4% and 58.97% respectively (Fig. 5A).

Discussion
With rapid dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, thousands of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) have been evolved and widely distributed. According
to CNCB 2019nCoVR database as of July 15th, 2020, we screened 18
non-synonymous mutations with ≥1% incidence, which were categorized into
15 types of mutation combinations.

After structural alignment, four mutated

proteins (Q57H Orf3a, G251V Orf3a, S194L N and R203K/G204R N) were
found displaying different structures from control N and Orf3a that were
essential for coronavirus assembly [17] and cytotoxicity [18].

Consistent with

our data, some predicted results showed that R203K/G204R in N also resulted
in destabilized protein structure [19].

But there were some mutations, such

as T85I in nsp2 and P323L in nsp12, found no significant impact on integral
protein structure according to our results.

However, their high frequency

prompt us to further investigate whether they could affect virus characteristics
via altering RNA second structure [20], protein stability [21] or partial structure

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.15.241349; this version posted August 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

[22].

For instance, experimental research reported that D614G in S could

lead to virus infectivity increased by eliminating side-chain hydrogen bond
which was only a tiny change in overall protein structure [23], and our data also
showed small structural difference between D614G mutant and control (RMSD
= 2.33 Å). Therefore, more research about SARS-CoV-2 mutations are worth
doing to determine whether structure alterations of Orf3a or N would affect
protein function and even virus infectivity.
Besides protein structure alteration, the mutations in virus genome
could also affect protein-protein interactions. With molecular docking and ΔG
value calculation, we found that protein binding affinity changed between all
four above mutants and their docking intraviral proteins.

It has been

confirmed that these protein interactions in SARS-CoV play indispensable
mediating roles in virus characteristics [6, 18, 24], thus their changes may
affect its infection.

Moreover, the combination of SARS-CoV Orf3a and S can

prevent the release of premature viral RNA [25], and Orf3a-M complex is
localized in Golgi [26], where virus particles are assembled by budding [27].
Our results showed stronger binding affinities in Q57H Orf3a-M and Q57H
Orf3a-S complexes, but weaker affinities in G251V Orf3a-M and G251V
Orf3a-S complexes.

Considering the incidences of Q57H in Orf3a (15.40%)

and G251V in Orf3a (2.77%) showed a great disparity, we speculated that
Orf3a mutants might be relevant to virus assembly and transmission.
Furthermore, some researches indicated that the interaction between N and E
had a function in SARS-CoV release [15, 28, 29], and the N-M complex was
necessary for the assembly of coronavirus [16]. Therefore, the enhanced
interaction between each SARS-CoV-2 N mutant (S194L or R203K/G204R)

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.15.241349; this version posted August 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

and E might promote virus release, while decreased binding affinity of S194L
N-M might attenuate virus assembly.

Besides, SARS-CoV N can bind to

heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) of host cells and
their interaction play a regulatory role in the synthesis of SARS-CoV RNA [30],
so it would be interesting to check the combination of these N mutants and the
proteins in host cells. What is more, the hot spots play critical roles in
protein-protein interactions, which were generally used as drugs target, so
their changes could have great impacts on clinical treatment [31]. Our results
demonstrated that all these selected SARS-CoV-2 mutations (Q57H and
G251V in Orf3a, S194L and R203K/G204R in N) had great influences on hot
spots within protein combinations, which indicated that it is essential to take
into account the interference of SARS-CoV-2 mutations during the
development of vaccines or drugs [32].
In the last several months, residents in more than 180 countries/regions
have been affected by SARS-CoV-2, and the emergence of mutations might
already make important contributions to virus adaption to new environments
and selective pressures, which in turn can impact transmissibility,
pathogenesis and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 [33].

It has been reported

that variant SARS-CoV-2 genomes occurred in different areas [34-38].

Our

results also showed that some mutations were widely distributed, and their
occurrence rates had different dynamic fluctuations. Take R203K/G204R in
N as an example, this mutation combination with increased incidence was
found mainly in Europe till March 2020 [39, 40], while our data showed its high
frequency was also in Asian countries as of July 2020, suggesting that these
two mutations might be conducive to SARS-CoV-2 adaptability and spread.

Therefore, it is particularly important to pay attention to the difficulties in
COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment that probably caused by these mutations,
especially in countries with high occurrence rates.

Although there is still no

reliable evidence for any necessary link between mutations and epidemic
outbreak in specific countries/regions, it is urgent to identify the relevance of
geographically aggregated mutations to SARS-CoV-2 transmission and
pathogenicity for effective containment of COVID-19 outbreaks.

Methods
Online resources
All information about the mutated SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained from
China National Center for Bioinformation 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource
(CNCB 2019nCoVR) (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov). Data were visualized by
GraphPad Prism 8.

Protein structure prediction
Protein structure of control SARS-CoV-2 S was from C-I-TASSER
(https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/C-I-TASSER/2019-nCoV/) [41], while
other SARS-CoV-2 protein structure models were predicted by I-TASSER [9].
For each protein, five models were generated and the model with the highest
C-score was selected as the best one and used for the following analysis.

Protein structure alignment
The mutated protein structures were aligned to corresponding control ones by

using the TM-align web-server [10].

Random structural similarity was

determined by TM-score between 0.0~0.3 and Root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) ≥5.0 Å [10, 42].

Molecular docking and hot spots prediction
Protein-protein docking was performed with the HADDOCK web-server
(http://haddock.chem.uu.nl/) [43]. The structure was chosen according to the
HADDOCK score, and complex binding affinity was calculated by PRODIGY
[44, 45] .

Hot spots within protein-protein interfaces were predicted using

Knowledge-based FADE and Contacts Server (KFC,
https://mitchell-web.ornl.gov/KFC_Server/index.php) [46].
