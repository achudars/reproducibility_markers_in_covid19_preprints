ABSTRACT

27

Most antibodies isolated from COVID-19 patients are specific to SARS-CoV-2. COVA1-

28

16 is a relatively rare antibody that also cross-neutralizes SARS-CoV. Here we determined

29

a crystal structure of COVA1-16 Fab with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and a negative-stain EM

30

reconstruction with the spike glycoprotein trimer, to elucidate the structural basis of its

31

cross-reactivity. COVA1-16 binds a highly conserved epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD,

32

mainly through a long CDR H3, and competes with ACE2 binding due to steric hindrance

33

rather than epitope overlap. COVA1-16 binds to a flexible up conformation of the RBD on

34

the spike and relies on antibody avidity for neutralization. These findings, along with

35

structural and functional rationale for the epitope conservation, provide a blueprint for

36

development of more universal SARS-like coronavirus vaccines and therapies.

MAIN

39

The ongoing coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic of severe acute

40

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] is unlikely to end anytime soon [2].

41

Given the current lack of protective vaccines and antivirals, virus clearance and recovery

42

of SARS-CoV-2 patients have to rely mainly on the generation of a neutralizing antibody

43

response. To date, most neutralizing antibodies from convalescent patients target the

44

receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein [3-7], whose natural

45

function is to mediate viral entry by first attaching to the human receptor angiotensin-

46

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and then fusing its viral membrane with the host cell [1, 8-

47

11]. SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically closely related to SARS-CoV [1], which caused the

48

2002-2003 human epidemic. However, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV only share 73%

49

amino-acid sequence identity in their RBD, compared to 90% in their S2 fusion domain.

50

Nevertheless, a highly conserved epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was previously

51

identified from studies of a SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody CR3022 [12, 13], which was

52

originally isolated almost 15 years ago [14]. Many human monoclonal antibodies have

53

now been shown to target the SARS-CoV-2 S protein [3-7, 13, 15-24], but cross-

54

neutralizing antibodies are relatively uncommon in COVID-19 patients [5, 6, 19, 25]. To

55

date, the only structurally characterized cross-neutralizing human antibodies are S309 [18]

56

and ADI-56046 [17] from SARS-CoV survivors, as well as EY6A from a COVID-19 patient

57

[26]. Such structural and molecular characterization of cross-neutralizing antibodies is

58

extremely valuable for therapeutic and vaccine design to confer broader protection against

59

human SARS-like viruses that include the extensive reservoir of zoonotic coronaviruses

60

in bats, camels, pangolins etc.

61
62

Antibody COVA1-16 was recently isolated from a convalescent COVID-19 patient and can

63

cross-neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 (IC50 0.13 μg/mL) and SARS-CoV (IC50 2.5 μg/mL)

64

pseudovirus [6]. The heavy and light chains of COVA1-16 are encoded by IGHV1-46,

65

IGHD3-22, IGHJ1, and by IGKV1-33, IGKJ4, with a relatively long complementarity

66

determining region (CDR) H3 of 20 amino acids (Figure S1). IGHV of COVA1-16 is only

67

1% somatically mutated at the nucleotide sequence level (one amino-acid change) from

68

the germline gene, whereas its IGKV is 1.4% somatically mutated (three amino-acid

69

changes). Here we determined the crystal structure of COVA1-16 in complex with SARS-

70

CoV-2 RBD at 2.89 Å resolution to identify its binding site (epitope) and mechanism of

71

cross-neutralization (Figure 1A, Table S1). The epitope of COVA1-16 overlaps extensively

72

with that of CR3022, but also extends towards the periphery of the ACE2 binding site

73

(Figure 1B) [13]. Seventeen out of 25 residues in the COVA1-16 epitope overlap with the

74

CR3022 binding site (17 of 28 residues) (Figure 1C). Consistent with structural

75

identification of its epitope, COVA1-16 can compete with CR3022 for RBD binding (Figure

76

S2). COVA1-16 appears to have some resemblance to SARS-CoV cross-neutralizing

77

antibody ADI-56046, whose epitope appears to span both the CR3022 epitope and ACE2-

78

binding site, as indicated by negative-stain electron microscopy (nsEM) [17]. Interestingly,

79

COVA1-16 also competes with ACE2 for RBD binding (Figure S2) [6], although its epitope

80

does not overlap the ACE2 binding site (Figure 1B). Therefore, COVA1-16 inhibits ACE2

81

binding due to steric hindrance with its light chain rather than by direct interaction with the

82

receptor binding site (Figure 1D).

83
84

The RBD can adopt up and down conformations on the S trimer [27, 28]. While the ACE2

85

receptor only binds the RBD in the up conformation [9], previously characterized cross-

86

neutralizing antibodies S309 from a convalescent SARS-CoV patient and COVA2-15 from

87

a SARS-CoV-2 patient [6], can bind the RBD in both up and down conformations [18, 27].

88

However, unlike S309, the COVA1-16 epitope is completely buried when the RBD is in

89

the down conformation (Figure 2A), akin to the CR3022 epitope [13]. Even in the up

90

conformation of the RBD on an unliganded SARS-CoV-2 S trimer [27], the epitope of

91

COVA1-16 would not be fully exposed (Figure 2A). We thus performed nsEM analysis of

92

COVA1-16 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer (Figure 2B). Three-dimensional (3D)

93

reconstructions revealed that COVA1-16 can bind to a range of RBD orientations on the

94

S protein when in the up position, indicating its rotational flexibility (Figure 2C). COVA1-

95

16 can bind the S trimer either from the top (i.e. perpendicular to the trimer apex, Figure

96

2C, yellow, blue and pink) or from the side (i.e. more tilted, Figure 2C, brown). Model fitting

97

of the COVA1-19/RBD crystal structure into the nsEM map indicates that the RBD on the

98

S trimer is more open around the apex when COVA1-16 binds compared to unliganded

99

trimers (Figure S3A-B). Bivalent binding of the COVA1-16 IgG between adjacent S trimers

100

also appears to be plausible (Figure S3C). A recent cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET)

101

analysis demonstrated that the average distance between prefusion S on the viral surface

102

is around 150 Å [29], which is comparable to the distance spanned between the tip of the

103

two Fabs on an IgG (typically around 100 Å to 150 Å, although longer distances have been

104

observed) [30]. Indeed, COVA1-16 IgG binds much more tightly than Fab to SARS-CoV-

105

2 RBD, with dissociation constants (KD) of 0.2 nM and 46 nM, respectively (Figure S4A),

106

reflecting bivalent binding in the assay format. Similarly, COVA1-16 IgG binds more

107

strongly than Fab to SARS-CoV RBD (KD of 125 nM vs 405 nM) (Figure S4B). Moreover,

108

the apparent affinity of COVA1-16 IgG decreased to approximately the Fab value when

109

the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RBD loaded on the biosensor was decreased, substantiating

110

the notion that COVA1-16 can bind bivalently in this assay (Figure S4C).

111
112

Bivalent IgG binding is also important for the neutralization activity of COVA1-16 (Figure

113

2D-E). COVA1-16 IgG neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with a half maximal inhibitory

114

concentration (IC50) of 0.02 μg/mL, which is similar to that previously measured for SARS-

115

CoV-2 pseudovirus (IC50 of 0.13 μg/mL) [6]. In contrast, COVA1-16 Fab does not

116

neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus even up to 13 μg/mL. A similar effect is also

117

observed for SARS-CoV pseudovirus, which is neutralized by COVA1-16 IgG at an IC50

118

of 29 μg/mL, but not by COVA1-16 Fab even up to 67 μg/mL (Figure 2E). Of note, COVA1-

119

16 is less potent against authentic SARS-CoV-2 (IC50 = 0.75 μg/mL) [6]. Whether such a

120

difference is due to variation in S protein density on the viral surface versus pseudovirus

121

or to other factors deserves future investigation. It will also be informative to compare the

122

number, density and conformational states of the S proteins on SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-

123

CoV virions. Overall, our findings support the importance of bivalent binding for SARS-

124

CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, and especially for cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV. Such

125

a contribution of bivalent IgG (avidity) to SARS-CoV-2 neutralization has also been

126

suggested in a recent study that compared binding of polyclonal IgGs and Fabs [24].

127

Furthermore, a single-domain camelid antibody VHH-72 dramatically improved its

128

neutralization activity to SARS-CoV-2 when expressed as a bivalent Fc-fusion [31]. These

129

observations are similar to some influenza broadly neutralizing antibodies to the

130

hemagglutinin (HA) receptor binding site, where bivalent binding can increase avidity and

131

neutralization breadth [32, 33].

132
133

Next we examined the molecular details of the interactions between COVA1-16 and

134

SARS-CoV-2. COVA1-16 binding to the RBD is dominated by the heavy chain, which

135

accounts for 82% of its total buried surface area (BSA, 694 Å2 out of a total of 844 Å2).

136

Most of the interactions are mediated by CDR H3 (Figure 3A), which contributes 70% (594

137

Å2) of the total BSA. CDR H3 forms a beta-hairpin with a type I beta-turn at its tip and is

138

largely encoded by IGHD3-22 (from VH N98 to VH Y100f, Figure S1C and Figure 3B). The

139

beta-hairpin conformation is stabilized by four main chain-main chain hydrogen-bonds (H-

140

bonds) and a side chain-side chain H-bond between VH N98 and VH Y100f at either end

141

of the IGHD3-22-encoded region (Figure 3B). Four H-bonds between the tip of CDR H3

142

and the RBD are formed from two main chain-main chain interactions with RBD C379,

143

and two with VH R100b (Table S2). The positively charged guanidinium of VH R100b also

144

interacts with the negative dipole at the C-terminus of a short α-helix in the RBD (residues

145

Y365 to Y369). Interestingly, VH R100b is a somatically mutated residue (codon = AGG in

146

the IGHD3-22-encoded region, where the germline residue is a Ser (codon = AGT, Figure

147

S1C). The short Ser side chain would likely not contact the RBD nor provide electrostatic

148

complementarity. Interestingly, a somatic revertant VH R100bS actually improved binding

149

affinity of COVA1-16 to the RBD, mostly due to an increased on-rate (Figure S5).

150

Nevertheless, COVA1-16 has a much slower off-rate than its VH R100bS mutant, which

151

may have led to its selection. The CDR H3 tip also interacts with the RBD through

152

hydrophobic interactions between VH Y99 and the aliphatic portion of RBD K378, as well

153

as a π−π interaction between VH Y100 and the RBD V382-S383 peptide backbone (Figure

154

3B). CDR H3 forms an additional four H-bonds with the RBD, involving the side chains of

155

VH R97 and Q101 (Figure 3B). We further determined the unliganded structure of COVA1-

156

16 Fab to 2.53 Å resolution and found that the CDR H3 distal region was not resolved due

157

to lack of electron density indicating its inherent flexibility (Figure S6). CDR H1 and CDR

158

L2 of COVA1-16 also interact with the RBD, but much less so compared to CDR H3. The

159

VH T28 main chain and VH Y32 side chain in CDR H1 H-bond with D427 (Figure 3C, Table

160

S2), whereas VL N53 in CDR L2 H-bonds with RBD R408 (Figure 3D, Table S2).

161
162

CDR H3-dominant antibodies have been seen in the human immune response to other

163

viral pathogens. Striking examples are antibodies PG9 and PG16, whose CDR H3s

164

interact extensively along their length with the apex of the HIV-1 Envelope protein [34, 35].

165

Another example is C05, which is essentially a single loop binder that inserts its very long

166

CDR H3 (24 residues) into the RBD of influenza HA [32], thereby providing a template for

167

design of a high-avidity protein inhibitor of influenza virus, where the H3 loop was fused

168

to a scaffold protein [36]. The long CDR H3 of COVA1-16 may similarly facilitate

169

therapeutic designs that could also include peptide-based antivirals, as exemplified by a

170

potent cyclic peptide fusion inhibitor of influenza HA [37, 38].

171
172

Compared to the ACE2-binding site, the COVA1-16 epitope is much more highly

173

conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and other SARS-related coronaviruses

174

(SARSr-CoV) (Figure 4A-D, Figure S7 and Figure S8) [6]. To investigate possible

175

structural and functional reasons for this sequence conservation, we analyzed the epitope

176

location in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S protein with all RBDs in the “down”

177

conformation [39] (Figure 4E and Figure S7). The COVA1-16 epitope is completely buried

178

at the center of the trimer in the interface between the S1 and S2 domains and is largely

179

hydrophilic (Figure S9). The polar side chains of K378, Q414, R408, and D427, which are

180

involved in binding to COVA1-16, are all very close to the interface with adjacent

181

protomers in the S trimer. Interestingly, the R408 side chain, which is positioned by Q414

182

via a H-bond, points towards a region in the adjacent protomer 2 with a positive

183

electrostatic potential. Similarly, D427 is juxtaposed to a region in protomer 2 with a

184

negative electrostatic potential. These repulsive charges would help favor the metastability

185

required for transient opening and closing of the RBD in "up" and “down” conformations

186

prior to ACE2 receptor binding. In contrast, the K378 side chain points towards a region

187

in protomer 3 with negative electrostatic potential, thus favoring the "down" RBD

188

conformation. Furthermore, in the "down" conformation, part of the COVA1-16 epitope

189

interacts with the long helices formed from the heptad repeat motifs of S2 fusion domain

190

(Figure 4E-F). Notably, S383 and T385 in the COVA1-16 epitope make three H-bonds

191

with the tops of the helices and their connecting regions (Figure 4F). This mixture of

192

attractive and repulsive forces would seem to be important for control of the dynamics of

193

the RBD and, hence, for the biological function of the metastable pre-fusion S protein in

194

receptor binding and fusion. The complementarity of fit of the epitope interface with the

195

other RBDs and the S2 domain in the S trimer further explains the epitope conservation

196

(Figure S10). Therefore, the high sequence conservation of the COVA1-16 epitope

197

appears related to the functional requirement for this component of the RBD surface to be

198

deeply buried within the S trimer in the "down" conformation.

199
200

From the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/antibody complex structures to date, a significant portion of

201

the RBD surface can be targeted by antibodies (Figure 5). One surface not yet observed

202

to be targeted is partially covered by N-glycans at residues N165 on the N-terminal domain

203

(NTD) and N343 on the RBD, which may hinder B cell receptor access and create a “silent

204

face” (Figure S11), although the N343 glycan is incorporated in the S309 epitope [18].

205

While antibodies that target the ACE2-binding site, such as BD23 [7], CB6 [23], B38 [20],

206

P2B-2F6 [19], CC12.1 [40], and CC12.3 [40], do not show cross-neutralization activity to

207

SARS-CoV, the conserved epitopes further from the ACE2-binding site seem to be more

208

able to support cross-neutralization [13, 18, 26]. It is also interesting that these so far rare

209

cross-neutralizing antibodies, including COVA1-16, often seem to bind to epitopes that

210

are not readily accessible in the pre-fusion native structure [17, 26]. This finding is similar

211

to a recent discovery in influenza virus, where a class of cross-protective antibodies target

212

a conserved epitope in the trimeric interface of the HA [41-43]. Due to the inaccessibility

213

of the COVA1-16 epitope on the S protein, it is possible that an RBD-based rather than S-

214

based immunogen can elicit larger numbers of COVA1-16-like antibodies. Cross-

215

neutralizing antibodies have also provided important insights into therapeutic and vaccine

216

design, as for influenza virus [44] and HIV [45]. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate in

217

the human population and other zoonotic coronaviruses constitute future pandemic

218

threats [46], it is certainly worth considering the development of more universal

219

coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics that can cross-neutralize antigenically drifted

MATERIALS AND METHODS

466

Expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 RBD

467

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) (residues 319-541) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)

468

protein (GenBank: QHD43416.1), and the RBD (residues 306-527) of the SARS-CoV S

469

protein (GenBank: ABF65836.1), were cloned into a customized pFastBac vector [47],

470

and fused with an N-terminal gp67 signal peptide and C-terminal His6 tag [13]. For each

471

RBD, we further cloned a construct with an AviTag inserted in front of the His6 tag. To

472

express the RBD, a recombinant bacmid DNA was generated using the Bac-to-Bac

473

system (Life Technologies). Baculovirus was generated by transfecting purified bacmid

474

DNA into Sf9 cells using FuGENE HD (Promega), and subsequently used to infect

475

suspension cultures of High Five cells (Life Technologies) at an MOI of 5 to 10. Infected

476

High Five cells were incubated at 28 °C with shaking at 110 r.p.m. for 72 h for protein

477

expression. The supernatant was then concentrated using a 10 kDa MW cutoff

478

Centramate cassette (Pall Corporation). The RBD protein was purified by Ni-NTA,

479

followed by size exclusion chromatography, and buffer exchanged into 20 mM Tris-HCl

480

pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl. For binding experiments, RBD with AviTag was biotinylated as

481

described previously [32] and purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Hiload 16/90

482

Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl.

Expression and purification of ACE2

493

The N-terminal peptidase domain of human ACE2 (residues 19 to 615, GenBank:

494

BAB40370.1) was cloned into phCMV3 vector and fused with a C-terminal Fc tag. The

495

plasmids were transiently transfected into Expi293F cells using ExpiFectamine™ 293

496

Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The

497

supernatant was collected at 7 days post-transfection. Fc-tagged ACE2 protein was then

498

purified with a Protein A column (GE Healthcare) followed by size exclusion

499

chromatography.

501

Crystallization and x-ray structure determination

502

The COVA1-16 Fab complex with RBD was formed by mixing each of the protein

503

components in an equimolar ratio and incubating overnight at 4°C. The COVA1-16

504

Fab/RBD complex and COVA1-16 Fab apo (unliganded) protein were adjusted to around

505

11 mg/mL and screened for crystallization using the 384 conditions of the JCSG Core

506

Suite (Qiagen) on our custom-designed robotic CrystalMation system (Rigaku) at Scripps

507

Research. Crystallization trials were set-up by the vapor diffusion method in sitting drops

508

containing 0.1 μl of protein and 0.1 μl of reservoir solution. Crystals used for x-ray data

509

collection were harvested from drops containing 0.2 M sodium iodide and 20% (w/v)

510

polyethylene glycol 3350 for the COVA1-16 Fab/RBD complex and from drops containing

511

0.08 M acetate pH 4.6, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.16 M ammonium sulfate

512

and 20% (v/v) glycerol for the COVA1-16 Fab. Crystals appeared on day 3, were

513

harvested on day 7, pre-equilibrated in cryoprotectant containing 20% glycerol, and then

514

flash cooled and stored in liquid nitrogen until data collection. Diffraction data were

515

collected at cryogenic temperature (100 K) at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource

516

(SSRL) on the new Scripps/Stanford beamline 12-1 with a beam wavelength of 0.97946

517

Å, and processed with HKL2000 [48]. Structures were solved by molecular replacement

518

using PHASER [49]. The models for molecular replacement of RBD and COVA1-16 were

519

from PDB 6XC4 [40], 4IMK [50] and 2Q20 [51]. Iterative model building and refinement

520

were carried out in COOT [52] and PHENIX [53], respectively. Epitope and paratope

521

residues, as well as their interactions, were identified by accessing PISA at the European

522

Bioinformatics Institute (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/prot_int/pistart.html) [54].

523
524

Expression and purification of recombinant S proteins

525

The SARS-CoV-2 S construct used for negative stain EM contains the mammalian-codon-

526

optimized gene encoding residues 1-1208 of the S protein (GenBank: QHD43416.1),

527

followed by a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization domain, an HRV3C cleavage site, 8x-His

528

tag and a Twin-strep tags subcloned into the eukaryotic-expression vector pcDNA3.4.

529

Three amino-acid mutations were introduced into the S1/S2 cleavage site (RRAR to

530

GSAS) to prevent cleavage and two stabilizing proline mutations (K986P and V987P) to

531

the HR1 domain. For additional S stabilization, residues T883 and V705 were mutated to

532

cysteines to introduce a disulphide bond. The S plasmid was transfected into 293F cells

533

and supernatant was harvested at 6 days post transfection. S protein was purified by

534

running the supernatant through a streptactin column and then by size exclusion

535

chromatography using a Superose 6 increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare

536

Biosciences). Protein fractions corresponding to the trimeric S protein were collected and

537

concentrated.

539

ns-EM sample preparation and data collection

540

SARS-COV-2 S protein was complexed with 3x molar excess of Fab at 30 minutes prior

541

to direct deposition onto carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grids. The grids were stained

542

with 2 % (w/v) uranyl-formate for 90 seconds immediately following sample application.

543

Grids were either imaged at 200 KeV or at 120 KeV on a Tecnai T12 Spirit using a 4kx4k

544

Eagle CCD. Micrographs were collected using Leginon [55] and the images were

545

transferred to Appion for processing. Particle stacks were generated in Appion [56] with

546

particles picked using a difference-of-Gaussians picker (DoG-picker) [57]. Particle stacks

547

were then transferred to Relion [58] for 2D classification followed by 3D classification to

548

sort well-behaved classes. Selected 3D classes were auto-refined on Relion and used to

549

make figures with UCSF Chimera.

550
551

Protein expression and purification for antibody binding studies

552

All constructs were expressed transiently in HEK293F (Invitrogen, cat no. R79009) cells

553

maintained in Freestyle medium (Life Technologies). For soluble RBD proteins, cells were

554

transfected at a density of 0.8-1.2 million cells/mL by addition of a mix of PEImax (1 µg/µL)

555

with expression plasmids (312.5 µg/L) in a 3:1 ratio in OptiMEM. Supernatants of the

556

soluble RBD proteins were harvested six days post transfection, centrifuged for 30 min at

557

4000 rpm and filtered using 0.22 µm Steritop filters (Merck Millipore). Constructs with a

558

His6-tag were purified by affinity purification using Ni-NTA agarose beads. Protein eluates

559

were concentrated, and buffer exchanged to PBS using Vivaspin filters with a 10 kDa

560

molecular weight cutoff (GE Healthcare). Protein concentrations were determined by

561

Nanodrop using the proteins peptidic molecular weight and extinction coefficient as

562

determined by the online ExPASy software (ProtParam). For the COVA1-16 IgG1

563

antibody, suspension HEK293F cells (Invitrogen, cat no. R79007) were cultured in

564

FreeStyle medium (Gibco) and co-transfected with the two IgG plasmids expressing the

565

corresponding HC and LC in a 1:1 ratio at a density of 0.8-1.2 million cells/mL in a 1:3

566

ratio with 1 mg/L PEImax (Polysciences). The recombinant IgG antibodies were isolated

567

from the cell supernatant after five days as described previously (20, 48). In short, the cell

568

suspension was centrifuged 25 min at 4000 rpm, and the supernatant was filtered using

569

0.22 µm pore size SteriTop filters (Millipore). The filtered supernatant was run over a 10

570

mL protein A/G column (Pierce) followed by two column volumes of PBS wash. The

571

antibodies were eluted with 0.1 M glycine pH 2.5, into the neutralization buffer of 1 M TRIS

572

pH 8.7 in a 1:9 ratio. The purified antibodies were buffer exchanged to PBS using 100 kDa

573

VivaSpin20 columns (Sartorius). The IgG concentration was determined on the NanoDrop

574

2000 and the antibodies were stored at 4°C until further analyses.

575
576

Measurement of binding affinities using biolayer interferometry

577

To determine the binding affinity of COVA1-16 IgG and His-tagged Fabs, 20 μg/mL of His-

578

tagged SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein in running buffer (PBS, 0.02% Tween-

579

20, 0.1% BSA) was loaded on Ni-NTA biosensors (ForteBio) for 300 s. Streptavidin

580

biosensors (ForteBio) were used if the RBD was biotinylated. Next, the biosensors were

581

transferred to running buffer containing IgG or Fab to determine the association rate, after

582

which the sensor was transferred to a well containing running buffer to allow dissociation.

583

As negative control, an anti-HIV-1 His-tagged Fab was tested at the highest concentration

584

used for COVA1-16 Fab (400 nM). After each cycle, the sensors were regenerated by

585

alternating 20 mM glycine in PBS and running buffer three times, followed by reactivation

586

in 20 mM NiCl2 for 120 s. All steps were performed at 1000 rpm shaking speed. KDs were

587

determined using ForteBio Octet CFR software. The avidity effects of IgG were

588

investigated by titrating the SARS-CoV-2 RBD concentration (5, 1, 0.2 and 0.04 μg/mL)

589

followed by loading on Ni-NTA biosensors for 480 s with an additional loading step with

590

His-tagged HIV-1 gp41 for 480 s to minimize background binding of His-tagged Fabs to

591

the biosensor. All other steps were performed as described above.

592
593

Competition studies of antibodies with ACE-2 receptor

594

For competition assays, COVA1-16 IgG, CR3022 IgG, and human ACE2-Fc were all

595

diluted to 250 nM. Ni-NTA biosensors were used. In brief, the assay has five steps: 1)

596

baseline: 60 s with 1x kinetics buffer; 2) loading: 180 s with 20 μg/mL, His6-tagged SARS-

597

CoV-2 RBD proteins; 3) baseline: 150 s with 1x kinetics buffer; 4) first association: 300 s

598

with CR3022 IgG or human ACE2-Fc; and 5) second association: 300 s with human ACE2-

599

Fc, CR3022 IgG, or COVA1-16 IgG.

600
601

Pseudovirus neutralization assay

602

Neutralization assays were performed using SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S-

603

pseudotyped HIV-1 virus and HEK-293T/ACE2 cells as described previously [59]. In brief,

604

pseudotyped virus was produced by co-transfecting expression plasmids of SARS-CoV S

605

and SARS-CoV-2Δ19 S proteins (GenBank; AAP33697.1 and MT449663.1, respectively)

606

with an HIV backbone expressing NanoLuc luciferase (pHIV-1NL4-3 ΔEnv-NanoLuc) in

607

HEK293T cells (ATCC, CRL-11268). After 3 days, the cell culture supernatants containing

608

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S-pseudotyped HIV-1 viruses were stored at -80℃. HEK-

609

293T/ACE2 cells were seeded 10,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate one day prior to the start

610

of the neutralization assay. To determine the neutralizing capacity of COVA1-16 IgG and

611

His6-tagged Fab, 20 or 100 µg/mL COVA1-16 IgG and equal molar of COVA1-16 Fab

612

were serially diluted in 3-fold steps and mixed with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2

613

pseudotyped virus and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The pseudotyped virus and COVA1-16

614

IgG/Fab mix were then added to the HEK-293T/ACE2 cells and incubated at 37°C. After

615

48 h, cells were washed twice with PBS (Dulbecco’s Phosphate-Buffered Saline,

617

using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and GloMax Discover System.

618

The inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined as the concentration of IgG or Fab that

619

neutralized 50% of the pseudotyped virus using GraphPad Prism software (version 8.3.0).

A372T and P384A are the only two mutations that differ between the SARS-CoV-2 and

123

mutant did not show any detectable difference from WT. Although the affinity (KD) of

124

COVA1-16 IgG to the P384A mutant decreases, the binding is still 100 times tighter than

125

that measured between COVA1-16 IgG and SARS-CoV RBD (Figure S4B). As a result,

126

the binding affinity of COVA1-16 to the RBD may be influenced by residues outside of the

epitope as well as the dynamics of the RBD fluctuations between up and down

128

conformations.

a

Numbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.
b
Rsym = Σhkl Σi | Ihkl,i - <Ihkl> | / Σhkl Σi Ihkl,i and Rpim = Σhkl (1/(n-1))1/2 Σi | Ihkl,i - <Ihkl> | / Σhkl Σi Ihkl,i, where Ihkl,i is the scaled
intensity of the ith measurement of reflection h, k, l, <Ihkl> is the average intensity for that reflection, and n is the
redundancy.
c
CC1/2 = Pearson correlation coefficient between two random half datasets.
d
Rcryst = Σhkl | Fo - Fc | / Σhkl | Fo | x 100, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.
e
Rfree was calculated as for Rcryst, but on a test set comprising 5% of the data excluded from refinement.
f
From MolProbity [7].
