ABSTRACT
The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 into a global pandemic within a few months of onset
motivates the development of a rapidly scalable vaccine. Here, we present a self-amplifying
RNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein encapsulated within a lipid nanoparticle as a
vaccine and demonstrate induction of robust neutralization of a pseudo-virus, proportional to
quantity of specific IgG and of higher quantities than recovered COVID-19 patients. These data
provide insight into the vaccine design and evaluation of immunogenicity to enable rapid
translation to the clinic.

MAIN
The unprecedented and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 into a global pandemic, with the
current estimated number of confirmed cases >2.2 million people,1 has motivated the need for a
rapidly producible and scalable vaccine. Coronaviruses are positive-sense, single stranded RNA
viruses that cause disease pathology ranging from the common cold to pneumonia.2,3 Despite
being listed on the WHO blueprint priority list, there are currently no licensed vaccines for SARS
or MERS.4 However, previous studies have elucidated the need to stabilize coronavirus spike
proteins in their pre-fusion conformation in order to serve as a vaccine immunogen.5
Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) is a highly
relevant platform for producing vaccines in the context of a global pandemic as it’s possible to
encode any antigen of interest6,7 and requires a minimal dose compared to messenger RNA
(mRNA).8 The first RNA therapeutic, which is formulated in LNP, was approved in 2018 and has
set the precedent for clinical safety of LNP-formulated RNA.9
Here, we compare the immunogenicity of saRNA encoding a pre-fusion stabilized
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein encapsulated in LNP in a preclinical murine model to the immune
response generated by a natural infection in recovered COVID-19 patients. We characterize
both the humoral and cellular response as well as the neutralization capacity of a pseudotyped
SARS-CoV-2 virus.

RESULTS
After confirming expression of the pre-fusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in
vitro (Supplementary Figure 1), mice were immunized with saRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein encapsulated in LNP with doses ranging from 0.01 to 10 μg (Figure 1a). Mice
received two injections, one month apart, and electroporated plasmid DNA (pDNA) was used as

a positive control while saRNA encoding the rabies glycoprotein (RABV) in pABOL was used as
a negative control. After 6 weeks, we observed remarkably high quantities of SARS-CoV-2
specific IgG in mouse sera in a dose-responsive manner, ranging from 105-106 ng/mL (Figure
1b). The groups that received doses of 10 and 1 μg of saRNA LNP were significantly higher
than the mice that received 10 μg of electroporated pDNA, with p=0.0036 and 0.0020,
respectively. All of the saRNA LNP-vaccinated mice, even the 0.01 μg group, had higher
quantities of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG compared to patients that had recovered from COVID19, which had a mean titer of 103 ng/mL and a range of 101-105 ng/mL. Importantly both the
pDNA and saRNA LNP immunizations induced a Th1-biased response in mice (Supplementary
Figure 2).
We then sought to characterize how antibodies generated by immunization compared to
those generated by a natural SARS-CoV-2 infection as far as capacity to neutralize a SARSCoV-2 pseudotyped virus (Figure 1c). We observed highly efficient viral neutralization that
varied in a linear dose-dependent manner for the mice vaccinated with saRNA LNP, with IC50
values ranging from 5x103 to 105. The groups that received 10 or 1 μg of saRNA LNP were
significantly higher than the electroporated pDNA positive control group, both with p<0.0001.
Comparison to the IC50 values of recovered COVID-19 patients, which had an average IC50 of
103, revealed that even the lowest dose of saRNA LNP (0.01 μg) in mice induced higher SARSCoV-2 neutralization than a natural infection in humans.
We then determined if there is a correlation between the quantity of SARS-CoV-2
specific IgG and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization IC50 for both vaccinated mice and patients who
have recovered from COVID-19. Both mice and patients have positive correlations between
antibody level and viral neutralization, with R2= 0.88 and 0.87 and p<0.0001 and =0.0007,
respectively, indicating that high antibody titers enable more efficient viral neutralization. We
also tested the sera of vaccinated mice and recovered patients against other pseudotyped
viruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and 229E-CoV (Supplementary Figure 3), and
observed slight neutralization of SARS-CoV by vaccinated mice sera, but otherwise no crossreactivity.

We also characterized the cellular response and induction of systemic cytokines in
response to vaccination with saRNA LNP (Figure 2). We observed that splenocytes from
vaccinated mice re-stimulated with a library of SARS-CoV-2 peptides yielded remarkably high
IFN-ߛ secretion as quantified by ELISpot (Figure 2a). The saRNA LNP groups that received
0.01-10 μg ranged from 1,000-2,600 SFU/106 splenocytes, and the 1 and 10 μg groups were
significantly higher than the EP pDNA positive control group, with p=0.0016 and 0.0078,
respectively. The re-stimulated splenocyte secretions were also characterized with a panel of
cytokines (Supplementary Figure 4), with notable increases in GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17a, IL21, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, TNF-α, IP-10, MIP-1β and RANTES.
We further characterized the immune response by assessing the systemic cytokine
response 4 hours after injection with LNP-formulated saRNA LNP (Figure 2b-g). The groups
that received 10 and 1 μg of saRNA LNP had enhanced levels of IL-6, MIP-1β, RANTEs, IFN-β
and IP-10 in the sera compared to the RABV control group, indicating that the LNP formulation
enables the immunogenicity of the saRNA. Data from the complete cytokine panel is presented
in Supplementary Figure 5.

DISCUSSION
Here we characterized the immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV-2 saRNA LNP vaccine
compared to the immune response of a natural infection in COVID-19 recovered patients. We
observed that two saRNA LNP immunizations induced remarkably high SARS-CoV-2 specific
IgG antibodies in mice, with quantities that were superior to both EP pDNA and natural infection
in humans, that were able to efficiently neutralize a pseudotyped virus. We also observed that
the saRNA LNP vaccine induces a robust cellular response, which is partially enabled by the
potent LNP formulation.
We observed that the saRNA-encoded pre-fusion stabilized spike protein of SARS-CoV2 used in these studies is highly immunogenic, yielding antibody titers >106 ng/mL (Figure 1),
which is superior to what others have reported for subunit vaccines for the SARS, MERS and
SARS-2 coronaviruses.10 Furthermore, we observed higher antibody titers, viral neutralization
(IC50) and cellular response for LNP-formulated saRNA than electroporated pDNA, which we
postulate is due to the potent LNP used in these studies, as previous comparisons between
polyplex-formulated saRNA and EP pDNA have yielded similar immunogenicity.8 This is highly
useful for translation as it means a potent LNP-formulated saRNA vaccine can be injected with
a widely accepted syringe and needle, and does not require electroporation instrumentation,
which we envision will enable more widespread vaccination to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
The saRNA LNP vaccine presented in these studies elicited robust antibody and cellular
responses, with a Th1 bias that we hypothesize will enable immunogenicity in humans. Ongoing
studies are being carried out to characterize the potential for antibody dependent enhancement
(ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 as has been observed for SARS and MERS,11,12 but the role of this
phenomena in vaccine-induced immunity is not yet fully understood. Overall, we believe that
these data inform the antigen design, formulation and preclinical evaluation of immunogenicity
that will enable rapid translation of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to the clinic trials.

METHODS

Vectors
We used a plasmid vector to synthesize a self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) replicon, based on a
Trinidad donkey Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus strain (VEEV) alphavirus genome. The
viral structural proteins driven from the sub-genomic promoter were replaced by the surface
‘spike’ glycoprotein of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2): GenBank accession number: QHD43416.1 with some modifications.13 The pre-fusion state
of the spike glycoprotein was stabilized by proline substitutions of K968 and V969. We
synthesized oligonucleotide fragments encoding the SARS-CoV-2 gene using GeneArt strings
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and assembled into the plasmid vector with NEB HiFi assembly (New
England BioLabs). An expression plasmid expressing the same pre-fusion stabilized full length
transmembrane protein used the pcDNA3.1 backbone and was directly synthesized and cloned
into the vector by GeneArt (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A plasmid that expressed a soluble pre-

fusion version was directly synthesized and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 backbone vector by
GeneArt (Thermo Fisher Scientific). This soluble version ends at glutamine Q1208 of the prefusion modified QHD43416.1 gene sequence followed by a GGGGSGGGGS linker, a T4 fibritin
(foldon) trimerization motif, a further GGGGSGGGGS linker, the Myc tag, a GSGSGS linker and
finally an 8xHIS tag to enable purification of the soluble recombinant protein. The RABV control
saRNA was based on the Pasteur strain: GenBank accession number: NP_056796.1 with the
F318V amino acid substitution to reduce glycoprotein binding to the neurotrophin receptor
(p75NTR), a natural ligand.

Recombinant soluble SARS-CoV-2 S expression and purification
The plasmid expressing the soluble pre-fusion version of SARS-CoV-2 S was used to produce
the recombinant protein using the FreeStyle™ 293 Expression System (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Conditioned medium was clarified by
centrifugation and protein was sequentially purified by a HisTrap HP column and a HiPrep 16/60
Sephacryl S-300 HR size exclusion chromatography (SEC) column (both from GE Healthcare).
Purified protein was first analyzed by Native-PAGE and Western blot, and then filtered through
a 0.22 μm membrane, aliquoted and stored at -80 °C.
In Vitro Transcription of RNA
Self-amplifying RNA encoding the pre-fusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 was produced using in
vitro transcription. pDNA was transformed into E. coli (New England BioLabs, UK), cultured in
100 mL of Luria Broth (LB) with 100 μg/mL carbenicillin (Sigma Aldrich, UK). Plasmid was
purified using a Plasmid Plus MaxiPrep kit (QIAGEN, UK) and the concentration and purity was
measured on a NanoDrop One (ThermoFisher, UK). pDNA was linearized using MluI for 3h at
37°C. Uncapped in vitro RNA transcripts were produced using 1 μg of linearized DNA template
in a MEGAScript™ reaction (Ambion, UK) for 2h at 37°C, according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Transcripts were then purified by overnight LiCl precipitation at -20°C, centrifuged at
14,000 RPM for 20 min at 4°C to pellet, washed with 70% EtOH, centrifuged at 14,000 RPM for
5 min at 4°C and resuspended in UltraPure H2O (Ambion, UK). Purified transcripts were capped
using the ScriptCap™ Cap 1 Capping System Kit (CellScript, WI, USA) for 2h at 37°C, according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Capped transcripts were purified by LiCl precipitation as
described above, resuspended in RNA storage buffer (10 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 100
mg/mL trehalose) and stored at -80°C until further use.

Cell Culture & saRNA Transfection
HEK293T/17 cells (ATCC) were cultured in complete Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
(DMEM) (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco,
Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1 % L-glutamine and 1 % penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) at 37°C, 5% CO₂. Cells were plated in a 12-well plate at a density of 0.75 x 106 cells
per well 48 h prior to transfection. Lipofectamine MessengerMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was
used according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the transfection of SARS-CoV-2 saRNA.

Flow Cytometry
Twenty-four hours post transfection, cells were harvested and resuspended in 1 mL of FACS
buffer (PBS + 2.5 % FBS) at a concentration of 1 x 107 cells /mL. One hundred microliters of the
resuspended cells was added to a FACS tube and stained with 50 µL of Live/Dead Fixable
Aqua Dead Cell Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a 1:400 dilution on ice for 20 min. Cells were
then washed with 2.5 mL of FACS buffer and centrifuged at 1750 RPM for 7 min. After
centrifugation, cells were stained with 2.5 µg of a SARS-CoV spike protein polyclonal antibody
(PA1-41165, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min on ice before washing with 2.5 mL of FACS
buffer and centrifuging at 1750 RPM for 7 min. Cells were then stained with 0.4 µg of FITC goat
anti-rabbit IgG (BD Pharmigen) for 30 min on ice. After incubation, cells were washed with 2.5
mL of FACS buffer, centrifuged at 1750 RPM for 7 min and resuspended with 250 µL of PBS.
Cells were fixed with 250 µL of 3 % paraformaldehyde for a final concentration of 1.5 %.
Samples were analyzed on a LSRForterssa (BD Biosciences) with FACSDiva software (BD
Biosciences). Data were analyzed using FlowJo Version 10 (FlowJo LLC).

Formulation of saRNA
saRNA was encapsulated in LNP using a self-assembly process in which an aqueous solution
of saRNA at pH=4.0 is rapidly mixed with an ethanolic lipid mixture.14 LNP used in this study
were similar in composition to those described previously15,16, which contain an ionizable
cationic lipid (proprietary to Acuitas)/phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol/PEG-lipid. The proprietary
lipid and LNP composition are described in US patent US10,221,127. They had a mean
hydrodynamic diameter of ∼75nm with a polydispersity index of <0.1 as measured by dynamic
light scattering using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK) instrument
and an encapsulation efficiency of >90% LNP.

RABV control group was formulated with 8 kDa pABOL at a ratio of polymer to RNA of 45:1
(w/w) using the titration method as previously described.7

Animals and immunizations
BALB/c mice aged 6-8 weeks old were placed into groups of n = 7 or 8. Animals were handled
and procedures were performed in accordance with the terms of a project license granted under
the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. All the procedures and protocols
used in this study were approved by an animal ethical committee, the Animal Welfare and
Ethical Review Body (AWERB). Groups of mice were injected intramuscularly (IM; quadriceps)
with a 50 µL of vaccine saRNA formulations. For animals that were vaccinated with pDNA, 10
µg of pDNA was injected in 50 µL PBS followed by electroporation (EP) using 5-mm electrodes
using an ECM 830 square-wave electroporation system (BTX) (pulses: 100 V of positive and
negative polarity at 1 pulse/s, 50 ms pulse). Animals were immunized at week 0, boosted with a
second vaccination at week 4 and euthanized using a Schedule 1 method at week 6, at which
time the spleens were removed and processed to single cells for use in assays. Serum samples
were collected at two-week intervals.

Recovered COVID-19 patient samples
Serum samples were donated to the Communicable Diseases Research Tissue Bank, Section
of Virology, Imperial College London, following written informed consent, by patients who had
been infected with SARS-CoV-2. The tissue bank is approved by the National Research Ethics
Service, South Central Committee Oxford C (Ref 15/SC/0089).

IFN-γ ELISpots
Assessment of the IFN-γ T cell response was performed using the Mouse IFN-γ ELISpotPLUS kit
(Mabtech) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, anti-IFN-γ pre-coated plates were
blocked with DMEM + 10% FBS for at least 30min, then cells were added at 2.5x105 cells/well
for negative control (media only) and SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools (15-mers overlapping by 11;
JPT Peptides) (1 µg/mL) in 200 µL final volume per well. The positive control wells contained
5x104 cells/well in 200 µL final volume per well with 5 µg/mL of ConA. Plates were incubated
overnight at 5% CO2, 37ºC incubator and developed as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Once

dried, plates were read using the AID ELISpot reader ELR03 and AID ELISpot READER
software (Autoimmun Diagnostika GmbH).

Antigen-specific Ig ELISA
The antigen-specific IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a titres in mouse sera were assessed by a semiquantative ELISA as previously described.17 In brief, MaxiSorp high binding ELISA plates
(Nunc) were coated with 100 μL/well of 1 μg/mL recombinant SARS-CoV-2 protein in PBS. For
the standard IgG/IgG1/IgG2a, 3 columns on each plate were coated with 1:1000 dilution each of
goat anti-mouse Kappa and Lambda light chains (Southern Biotech). After overnight incubation
at 4ºC, the plates were washed 4 times with PBS-Tween 20 0.05% (v/v) and blocked for 1 h at
37ºC with 200 μL/well blocking buffer (1% BSA (w/v) in PBS-Tween 20 0.05%(v/v)). The plates
were then washed and the diluted samples or a 5-fold dilution series of the standard IgG (or
IgG1 or IgG2) added using 50 μL/well volume. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37ºC, then
washed and secondary antibody added at 1:2000 dilution in blocking buffer (100 μL/well) using
either anti-mouse IgG-HRP, anti-mouse IgG1-HRP or anti-mouse IgG2a-HRP (Southern
Biotech). After incubation and washes, plates were developed using 50 μL/well SureBlue TMB
(3,3', 5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine) substrate and the reaction stopped after 5 min with 50 μL/well
stop solution (Insight Biotechnologies). The absorbance was read on a Versamax
Spectrophotometer at 450 nm (BioTek Industries).

Neutralization assay
A HIV-pseudotyped luciferase-reporter based system was used to assess the neutralization
ability of sera from vaccinated animals and recovered patients against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV2, MERS-CoV and 229E-CoV, as previously described with modifications.18,19 In brief, CoV Spseudotyped viruses were produced by co-transfection of 293T/17 cells with a HIV-1 gag-pol
plasmid (pCMV-Δ8.91, a kind gift from Prof. Julian Ma, St George’s University of London), a
firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pCSFLW, a kind gift from Prof. Julian Ma, St George’s
University of London) and a plasmid encoding the S protein of interest (pSARS-CoV-S, pSARSCoV2-S, pMERS-CoV-S or p229E-CoV-S) at a ratio of 1:1.5:1. Virus-containing medium was
clarified by centrifugation and filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane 72h after transfection, and
subsequently aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. For the neutralization assay, heat-inactivated sera
were first serially diluted and incubated with virus for 1 h, and then the serum-virus mixture was
transferred into wells pre-seeded Caco2 cells. After 48h, cells were lysed and luciferase activity

was measured using Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). The IC50 neutralization
was then calculated using GraphPad Prism (version 8.4).

Cytokine measurement in splenocytes and sera
Splenoctyes isolated from each individual mouse were plated into round bottom 96 well plates
(1 x 106 per well in a 200 uL total volume) and cultured for 7 days with media alone, 5 ug / mL
SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein or 5 ug / mL ConA as a positive control. For the sera
samples, mice were bled 4h after injection with SARS-CoV-2 LNP vaccine or control RABV
vaccine and sera were collected. The cytokine response in each well was quantified with a
custom 25-plex ProcartaPlex Immunoassay (ThermoFisher Scientific, UK) on a Bio-Plex 200
System (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Statistical analysis
Graphs and statistics were prepared in GraphPad Prism (version 8.4). Statistical differences
were analyzed using either a two-way ANOVA adjusted for multiple comparisons or a KruskalWallis test adjusted for multiple comparisons, with p<0.05 used to indicate significance.
