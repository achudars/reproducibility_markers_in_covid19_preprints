Abstract
Background and Objectives: Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine are or were among the
most promising therapeutic options to tackle the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Besides the
use of the prodrug remdesivir itself, the direct administration of GS-441 524, the resulting main
metabolite of remdesivir, could be advantageous and even more effective. All substances
were not originally developed for the treatment of COVID-19 and especially for GS-441 524
little is known about its pharmacokinetic and physical-chemical properties. To justify the
application of new or repurposed drugs in humans, pre-clinical in vivo animal models are
mandatory to investigate relevant PK and PD properties and their relationship to each other.
In this study, an adapted mouse model was chosen to demonstrate its suitability to provide
sufficient information on the model substances GS-441 524 and HCQ regarding plasma
concentration and distribution into relevant tissues a prerequisite for treatment effectiveness.
Methods: GS-441 524 and HCQ were administered intravenously as a single injection to male
mice. Blood and organ samples were taken at several time points and drug concentrations
were quantified in plasma and tissue homogenates by two liquid chromatography/tandem
mass spectrometry methods. In vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the
degradation of remdesivir in human plasma and blood. All pharmacokinetic analyses were
performed with R Studio using non-compartmental analysis.
Results: High tissue to plasma ratios for GS-441 524 and HCQ were found, indicating a
significant distribution into the examined tissue, except for the central nervous system and fat.
For GS-441 524, measured tissue concentrations exceeded the reported in vitro EC50 values
by more than 10-fold and in consideration of its high efficacy against feline infectious
peritonitis, GS-441 524 could indeed be effective against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. For HCQ,
relatively high in vitro EC50 values are reported, which were not reached in all tissues. Facing
its slow tissue distribution, HCQ might not lead to sufficient tissue saturation for a reliable
antiviral effect.

Conclusion: The mouse model was able to characterise the PK and tissue distribution of both
model substances and is a suitable tool to investigate early drug candidates against SARSCoV-2. Furthermore, we could demonstrate a high tissue distribution of GS-441 524 even if
not administered as the prodrug remdesivir.

Introduction

Due to threat of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, scientists around the world work
vigorously on the development of therapeutic options, be it new chemical entities, antibodies,
or repurposed known drug molecules. In order to advance quickly from pre-clinical to clinical
studies, successful in vivo experiments in animal models are mandatory, a fact recently
acknowledged by Dinnon and colleagues [1]. An adapted mouse model could be a suitable
proof-of-concept for new compounds as demonstrated for remdesivir (REM) [2]. However, to
step up to humans, the relationship between pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics
(PK) needs to be assessed in such a model to calculate an appropriate dose.
Two prominent examples of drug candidates against COVID-19 are REM and
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). REM represents a prodrug developed to quickly convert to the
corresponding nucleoside (GS-441 524) intracellularly or even in plasma (Figure 1). However,
using GS-441 524 would be a more direct treatment strategy which does not rely on enzymatic
conversion, and thus be more suitable to demonstrate the applicability of a model. GS-441
524 is the major circulating plasma metabolite of REM but only very limited data on the PK of
this compound are available. Furthermore, the efficacy of REM for COVID-19 should be reevaluated in comparison to its main metabolite (GS-441 524), which was highly effective
against feline coronavirus (FCoV) causing feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [3-5]. In fact,
theoretical considerations come to the conclusion, that the prodrug REM might not be the most
appropriate nucleoside strategy for the treatment of COVID-19. After all, it was specifically
designed as prodrug to target the Ebola virus [6-8], while the broad and extensive multi-organ
pathology of COVID-19 could actually benefit from direct application of GS-441 524.
The aim of this study was to demonstrate the applicability of mice to assess in vivo
pharmacokinetics of two pharmacologically extremely different compounds with regards to
their pharmacokinetic and physical-chemical properties. Moreover, not only plasma
concentrations, but also the amount and levels in relevant tissue should be assessable to
obtain information on the distribution, an important aspect regarding the question whether or
not the foci of infection could even be reached, in vivo. In the present work, we chose a mouse

model using GS-441 524 and HCQ as model compounds. We further investigated the
degradation of remdesivir in human plasma and blood in vitro in order to add data on the
aspect of its short plasma half-life and origin of GS-441 524 after administration as the
phosphoramidate prodrug.

2.1

Experimental
Materials

GS-441 524 was purchased from BIOSYNTH® Carbosynth (Berkshire, UK), HCQ sulphate
(purity: 98.5 %), [2H]5-piperacillin, [2H]4-amoxicillin and meropenem-d6 from Toronto Research
Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). Acetonitrile ChromasolvTM Gradient was purchased from
Riedel-de Haën (Seelze, Germany). Human EDTA Plasma was obtained from BioIVT (West
Sussex, United Kingdom) Other chemicals used were of analytical grade and from VWR
International GmbH (Darmstadt, Germany). Ammonium acetate, ammonium hydroxide (25%),
Sodium hydroxide solution, sodium chloride solution (0.9% m/V), ethanol, propylene glycol,
PEG 400, Microvetten CB300 from Sarstedt AG & Co. KG (Nümbrecht, Germany). Ultra pure
water was obtained using a Milli-Q® purification system (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA,
USA).
2.2

Animals

Animal care was provided in accordance with the guidelines of the EU Directive 2010/63/EU
and the German Animal Welfare Agency. All experiments were approved by an ethics
committee and the governmental agency (Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection
and Food Safety; LAVES; protocol number: AZ 20A509). All efforts were made to minimize
both the suffering and the number of animals. A total of 16 naive male mice (n=8 for HCQ,
n=8 for GS-441 524) at 12-21 weeks of age and 22.5-38.4 g body weight on a BDF1
(C57BL6/DBA2 hybrid) background bred and housed in the institute’s facility were used.
Animals were group housed (3-4 animals per cage) on standard bedding (shredded wood)
and maintained on a reversed 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (lights off at 11 a.m.). Room
temperature in the mouse holding room was 22 °C ± 2 °C and relative humidity was about

60%; values were recorded during the daily animal check. Food (Altromin standard diet) and
water were available ad libitum and material for nest-building (paper rolls) was provided in
addition to red plastic houses as enrichment.
2.3

Dosing and formulation

All drugs or vehicle were administered intravenously as a single injection at a volume of 5
mL/kg via the tail vein.
2.3.1

GS-441 524

For pharmacokinetic studies in mice, GS-441 524 was dissolved in sterile aqua ad injectabilia
with 0.625 % Ethanol, 3.75 % propylene glycol, and 5.625 % PEG 400. The pH of the drug
solution and the vehicle was adjusted to 2.88 with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric
acid (HCl), respectively. Mice were randomly assigned to GS-441 524 at 10 mg/kg (n=6) or
the respective vehicle (n=2).
2.3.2

HCQ

HCQ was dissolved in sterile aqua ad injectabilia. Isotonic saline solution served as vehicle
control. Solutions were prepared just prior to injection, and the final concentrations of
compounds were verified from aliquots using LC-MS/MS. A cohort of mice was randomly
assigned to HCQ at 5 mg/kg (free base, n=6) or the respective vehicle (n=2).

2.4

Collection of blood, plasma and tissue samples

The target and actual time of blood sampling were recorded relative to the time of injection.
Blood samples were collected into microvette CB300 potassium-EDTA tubes, briefly mixed by
slow inversion and placed on ice immediately. Within 1 hour after collection, plasma was
separated by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 °C.
Blood samples were collected from all mice immediately prior to injection of drugs or vehicle
(baseline control) from the tail vein (20-30 µL), and immediately after injection from the facial,

sub-mandibular, vein (20-30 µL). The plasma or whole blood was protected from light and
stored at -80 °C until analyzed by LC-MS/MS for quantification.
2.4.1

GS-441 524

The animal group for testing GS-441 524 was split in half to allow further repeated blood
sampling at 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min as follows: n=3 (and n=1 vehicle) were bled at 15
and 30 min post injection from the facial vein, and at 60 min after sacrifice by decapitation
from the vena cava; the other n=3 (and n=1 vehicle) were bled at 60 and 120 min post injection
from the facial vein, and at 240 min after sacrifice from the vena cava.
From GS-441 524 or respective vehicle injected mice, the following organs were taken at
sacrifice 60 min post injection: cerebrum, cerebellum, lung, liver, kidneys (partly separated in
cortex and medulla), spleen, heart, muscle (quadriceps). For animals sacrificed 240 min post
injection, additional samples were taken as follows: stomach, intestine (separated in small
intestine and colon), nasal mucosa, and a sample of the cortex separated from cerebrum.
2.4.2

HCQ

The animal group for testing HCQ was also split in half to allow further blood sampling. In
addition to the immediate sample, blood sampling was repeated at 60 and 180 min from the
facial vein, and at 360 min after sacrifice from the vena cava in one group (n=3 plus n=1
vehicle) and at 240, 480 min and 24 hrs from the facial vein, and at 30 hrs after sacrifice from
the vena cava in the other group (n=3 plus n=1 vehicle). An additional 50 µL of whole blood
was taken at sacrifice from the vena cava and transferred into plastic tubes without additives.
From HCQ and respective vehicle injected mice, all the above mentioned organ samples
(GS-441 524) were taken, with the addition of pancreas. Surgical equipment was carefully
cleaned with ddH2O and dried between samples.

In both cases, organs were quickly dried with moistened gauze to remove excess water, blood
or content in case of intestines, placed in cryotubes and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and
kept at -80 °C until analyzed by LC-MS/MS for quantification.
2.5

Determination of plasma and tissue concentrations

GS-441 524 and HCQ concentrations were quantified in mouse plasma and several mouse
tissue homogenates by two liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
methods using an SCIEX API 6500TM triple quadrupole (GS-441 524) and an API 5500 triple
quadrupole (HCQ) mass spectrometer (SCIEX, Concord, Ontario, Canada). Both instruments
were equipped with turbo ion spray interface (SCIEX, Concord, Ontario, Canada). Details
about the methods including quality data are described in two separate publications currently
in preparation.
2.6

Pharmacokinetic analysis

Data acquisition and processing of raw data was performed using Analyst software version
1.7 (GS-441 524) or 1.6.2 (HCQ) (SCIEX, Concord, Ontario, Canada). Raw data were
collected and processed using Microsoft Excel 2016 Version 16.0 (Microsoft Corporation,
Redmond, WA, USA). Statistical calculations included descriptive analysis, simulations and
visualization of results was performed with R Studio Version 1.2.5042 (RStudio Incorporation,
Boston, MA, USA) running R version 3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria, 2020) using the packages ‘ggplot2’, ‘NonCompart’, and ‘tidyverse’ [9-12]. AUC was
calculated using the linear up, logarithmic down method. The terminal slope (z) was
calculated by log-linear regression of the last three data points. Published PK-data was
imported using the WebPlotDigitizer version 4.3 [13].

In vitro degradation of remdesivir in human plasma
Samples

Commercially available EDTA-Plasma was spiked with remdesivir at a concentration of 14
μg/mL. 3 mL Aliquots of this solution were stored for 23 hours and 40 minutes at 4 °C, at room
temperature, and at 38 °C.
For high resolution mass spectrometry, 25 μL of each sample were extracted with 150 μL of
acetonitrile and centrifuged for 5 min at 3 °C/14k rpm (A). 25 μL of the supernatant were diluted
with 435 μL water (B). Alternatively, 100 μL of sample where extracted with 400 μL methanol
(C).
For LC-MS/MS, 50 µL of each sample were combined with 300 µL internal standard solution
(acetonitrile containing 50 and 250 ng/mL [2H]5-piperacillin and [2H]4-amoxicillin as internal
standards) and vortex mixed for 10 seconds. After centrifugation for 3 min at 4 °C/11k rpm,
300 µL of supernatant were mixed with 300 µL of water and 1000 µL of dichloromethane and
mixed thoroughly. After centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C/3.6k rpm, the aqueous layer was
transferred to an HPLC vial.
2.7.2

High resolution LC-MS negative

A Sciex X500 qTOF mass spectrometer (Sciex, Darmstadt, Germany) was coupled to an
Agilent Infinity 1290 UHPLC (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) and operated in ESI negative
mode. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Hypercarb 5 µm 100x2.1mm column
(ThermoFischer Scientific, Germany) as stationary phase using 100 mM ammonium acetate
at pH 9.5 (NH4OH 25%) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% (V/V) NH4OH 25% as mobile phase
A and B, respectively. The gradient was programmed as follows: 0-0.5 min: 100% A, 0.5-3
min: 10030% A, 3-3.5 min: 305% A, 3.5-3.6 min: 5100%A, 3.6-5 min: 100% A. The flow
rate was set to 600 µL/min.

A Sciex 5500 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was coupled to an Agilent 1200 HPLC and
operated in ESI positive mode using the MRM experiment. Chromatographic separation was
achieved on a Kinetex F5 2.6 µm 50x4.6mm column (Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany)
as stationary phase using water containing 0.1% (V/V) formic acid and acetonitrile containing

Plasma and blood concentrations
GS-441 524

The pooled data of 6 mice was used to estimate the PK properties of GS-441 524 in wildtype
mice (see Figure 2 A). Based on the estimated z and AUC0-∞, the volume of distribution (Vz)
was estimated at 1.39 L/kg, whereas Clearance was estimated at 1.19 L/h/kg.
3.2.2

HCQ

The pooled data of 6 mice was used to estimate PK parameters of HCQ in wildtype mice. Vz
and Clearance were estimated at 20.1 L/kg and 0.77 L/h/kg, respectively. The mean blood-toplasma ratio (B/P) 6 and 30 hours after infusion of 5 mg/kg HCQ was 3.13±1.43 (n = 3) and
1.31±0.104 (n = 3), respectively. The obtained plasma concentration-time profile is presented
in Figure 2 B.

Tissue concentrations
GS-441 524

One hour after administration of 10 mg/kg, mean tissue-to-plasma ratio (T/P) ranged from 0.14
(brain) to 2.70 (adrenal cortex). Four hours after i.v. administration, mean T/P was as high as
0.22 and 13.02 in brain and adrenal cortex, respectively (see Figure 3 A). Highest mean T/P
were observed for liver (13.67), kidneys (8.61-27.04) and intestines (> 8.0). Obtained absolute
tissue concentrations are presented in Table 1. The full summary is presented in Table S1.
3.3.2

HCQ

Six hours after administration of 5 mg/kg, mean T/P ranged from 0.45 (cerebellum) to 34.51
(lungs). With exception of tissue found in the CNS, fat, muscle, colon and stomach wall, mean
T/P was at least 10 for all tissues (see also Figure 3 B). Obtained absolute tissue
concentrations are presented in Table 1. The full summary is presented in Table S2.

In vitro degradation of remdesivir in human plasma

TOF-MS and TOF-MS/MS experiments revealed a rapid decrease of REM at elevated
temperature in plasma in vitro. At the same time, the peak due to the alanine metabolite
appeared and increased accordingly. GS-441 524 was not detected in those experiments
(Fig. S1-S3).
In the low resolution LC-MS/MS experiments, GS-441 524 and the alanine metabolite were
present at about the same level, expressed as peak area ratio (analyte/internal standard) prior
to incubation. After incubation at 38 °C the peak ratios increased by a factor of 94.3 and 29.9
for the alanine metabolite and GS-441 524 respectively. More than 99% of REM were
degraded within 24 hours at 38 °C.

Discussion

4.1
4.1.1

Plasma pharmacokinetics
GS-441 524

GS-441 524 is the major circulating plasma metabolite of REM but only very limited data is
available on the PK of this compound. Most on the information obtainable from published
sources refers to the PK after administration as the prodrug REM (GS-5734) either in animal
models [6, 8] or healthy human subjects [14]. There is also a case report of two COVID-19
patients receiving REM [15]. Further hints on the PK of GS-441 524 can be found in the
assessment report for Gilead Sciences` Veklury (REM) [16]. To our knowledge, the only other
publications investigating the PK after administration in the form of the nucleoside are
investigations by Murphy and colleagues in cats [5].
In comparison to the estimated pharmacokinetics in cats, our results are in the same order of
magnitude however suggesting increased clearance and reduced volume of distribution (see
Table 2). These discrepancies could be due to interspecies differences, further highlighting
the importance of thorough pharmacokinetic studies in species used to model COVID-19.

It was suggested by Yan and Muller, that REM in vivo is predominantly hydrolysed in plasma
to yield GS-441 524 rather than being activated intracellularly [17]. However, this theory
seems to contradict the increasing dose dependant half-life of GS-441 524 after administration
as REM (see Table 2). The dose dependency furthermore suggests that in this case half-life
is not defined by the elimination rate constant. Instead, the liberation of GS-441 524 from
tissue/organs saturated with the prodrug is suggested to be the rate limiting process at higher
doses. This is underlined by the fact that renal clearance increases with increasing half-life
(Table 2). The mass-balance study for REM (GS-US-399-4231) disclosed that renal clearance
is the most relevant elimination pathway and GS-441 524 is the predominant metabolite
detected in urine (49%), followed by REM (10%). It is therefore not surprising that in one
human patient with renal impairment receiving REM for the treatment of COVID-19, all
GS-441 524 plasma concentrations were significantly elevated compared to another critically
ill patient without renal impairment [15].
4.1.2

HCQ

Being a comparatively old drug, the PK of HCQ has been studied extensively. However, there
is still limited information on its pharmacokinetics especially with regard to distribution. Reports
considering the terminal half-life in plasma or blood are inconclusive and range from approx.
5 to 50 days [18, 19]. These values refer to an elimination half-life calculated after
discontinuation from steady state. Due to the high degree of tissue distribution these long halflifes include redistribution from tissue and thus are considerably longer compared to a half-life
calculated from a single dose or within steady state. The plasma half-life calculated from our
data is comparable to the half-lifes obtained in mice and humans (Table 4).
HCQ exhibits complex pharmacokinetics with extremely high volume of distribution ranging
from approx. 600 to 6400 L for a 70 kg adult. The value obtained from our experiments falls in
that range and is comparable to the Vz obtained in mice from blood concentrations and to
plasma Vz measured in humans (see Table 4). The substance is subject to renal and hepatic
elimination. Three major metabolites are known: bis-desethyl chloroquine, desethyl

chloroquine, and monodesethyl hydroxychloroquine. The latter two are considered active
metabolites [19]. HCQ is predominantly metabolized via CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 [20]
and approximately 26% of HCQ are eliminated renally as parent drug by filtration and most
likely also tubular secretion [20, 21]. Due to the structural similarity to chloroquine, which is a
MATE-1 substrate, secretion via this transporter seems probable [22].
Tett et al. were the first to report bioavailability and terminal half-life of HCQ. They described
the pharmacokinetics of a single i.v. and oral dose using a four- and tri-exponential equation,
respectively [21]. The estimated oral systemically available fraction ranged from 0.69 to 0.79.
Later investigations by Carmichael and colleagues confirmed this finding with their estimate
of 0.746 [23].
In plasma, the compound is bound to serum albumin and 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), which
is not unusual for alkaloids [18]. The plasma protein binding ranged from 34.1 to 58.7%, was
dependant on the concentration of (AAG), and was higher (approx. 1.5-fold) for the Senantiomer [24]. Thrombocytes and especially leukocytes have been identified as deep
compartment for HCQ leading to a blood-to-plasma ratio (B/P) ranging from 5.4 to 10 [20, 24].
Due to the acidic environment and organelles in those cells, HCQ is trapped in the protonated
form within those kinds of cells, but not in erythrocytes. To our knowledge, B/P of HCQ has
not been studied in mice before and seems to be lower according to our results. This might
be explained by the fact that the murine cellular immune system differs from the humane.
Whereas human blood is particularly rich in neutrophils (50-70% of leukocytes) this cell type
plays a minor role in the murine blood (10-25% of leukocytes) which is dominated by
lymphocytes [25].
Chhonker et al. recently published an analytical method and information on the
pharmacokinetics, including the metabolites of HCQ, in mice [26]. However, their method was
not validated for mouse plasma and therefore not suitable to determine T/P or B/P of HCQ. It
is noteworthy, that the blood concentrations in the terminal phase obtained by Chhonker et al.

are approx. 1.3 times higher (B/P measured at 30 h post dose was 1.31) compared to the
plasma concentrations obtained in our experiment.
Despite the accumulation of HCQ in blood cells, Chhonker et al. measured initially lower blood
concentrations compared to our plasma concentrations at the same dose [26] (see Figure 2
B) underlining the time dependency of HCQ distribution. The initial concentration measured
by Chhonker and colleagues most likely represents plasma concentration “diluted” with
erythrocytes, as accumulation in leukocytes and thrombocytes had not yet taken place.
Furthermore, it could be agreed, that for the purpose of TDM, whole blood concentrations
might be more suitable compared to plasma concentrations, due to the lower variability in
whole blood. On the other hand, the determination of pharmacokinetic parameters on the basis
of whole blood concentrations might not be the best choice, since distribution and clearance
processes usually only affect (unbound) drug molecules in the plasma and redistribution from
blood cells might be slow.

Tissue distribution
GS-441 524

In cynomolgus monkeys REM ([14C]GS-5734, 10 mg/kg), showed a tissue-to-plasma ratio
(T/P) for testes and epididymis of about 1 to 1.5 after 4 h. A considerably lower amount of
radioactivity was recovered from eyes and brain (T/P: ~ 0.5 and ~ 0.1, respectively) indicating
towards a low permeability for the blood-brain barrier for REM or any of the downstream
metabolites [8]. Furthermore, tissue partition coefficients (KTP) < or > 1 indicate involvement
of influx and efflux transporters which can play an important role regarding rate and extent of
tissue distribution [27]. KT/P < 1 is due to efflux processes as it is mediated especially in the
brain via P-gp. As REM was found to be a substrate for P-gp, low KTP values found in the brain
of cynomolgus monkeys are plausible. To our knowledge, GS-441 524 itself was not
investigated as a transporter substrate but according to our data, tissue-to-plasma ratio in the
brain is far below 1. A hypothetical affinity of GS-441 524 to P-gp, besides its low membrane
permeability, would therefore also be conceivable.

In COVID-19 patients receiving REM, a CSF to plasma ratio of 25.7% was reported by
Tempestilli et al. [15]. Furthermore, they found GS-441 524 concentrations in bronchoalveolar
aspirate of 8.6 and 9.2 ng/mL on day 4 and 2.7 and 3.3 ng/mL on day 7, respectively (2
patients).
Our data revealed a significant distribution of GS-441 524 into numerous organs, such as liver
and kidney with high KT/P values both after one and after four hours. Hence, the
phosphoramidate prodrug structure in the form of REM might not be necessary to achieve
sufficiently high tissue and even intracellular concentrations. The high efficiency of
GS-441 524 in treating FIP corroborates this finding [4]. Given the multi-organ pathology
observed in COVID-19, successful treatment strategies require broad distribution. Lack of
penetration into brain tissue after could explain limited efficacy of most therapeutics against
neurological symptoms which are frequent and debilitating in severe COVID-19 patients [28].
As GS-441 524 represents the nonphosphorylated nucleoside form of REM, an active uptake
process into the cell via equilibrative (ENT) or concentrative (CNT) transporters is plausible
[29]. Yan and Muller also brought up the idea that, besides slow passive diffusion, GS-441 524
crosses membranes using nucleoside transporters [17]. A variety of nucleoside based antiviral
drugs (e.g. Ribavirin) and their corresponding transporter proteins is presented by PastorAnglada et al. [30]. Due to the adenosine structure in GS-441 524, purine-preferring CNT2 is
one of the most probable nucleoside transporter (Km value of 8 µM for adenosine) to mediate
intracellular uptake [30]. In comparison, Km values for adenosine uptake by ENT1 (Km 40 µM)
and ENT2 (Km 140 µM) are much higher [31]. Nevertheless, they should not be overlooked as
several nucleoside transporters can be expressed by a single cell.
Reported in vitro EC50 values obtained from GS-441 524 against other coronaviridae range
from 0.86 (±0.78) µM (HAE cells infected with MERS) to 0.78 µM (CRFK cells infected with
FCoV) to 0.18 (±014) µM (HAE cells infected with SARS-CoV) [32]. Pruijssers and colleagues
demonstrated that GS-441 524 was activated to the active GS-441 524 triphosphate (TP)

following distribution into Vero E6 and Calu3 cells. However, bioactiviation of GS-441 524 was
lower in Calu3 cells and higher in Vero E6 cells compared to REM. The activation in HAE cells
was not investigated for GS-441 524. This differences in GS-441 524 TP formation could
explain the differences in observed EC50 values against SARS-CoV-2 for REM vs.
GS-441 524. EC50 values for GS-441 524 against SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 and Calu3
cells ranged from 0.47 to 1.09 µM, respectively (depending on cell type and assay) [2]. In the
light of the high efficacy of GS-441 524 against FIP and the similar EC50 values, these data
support the hypothesis, that GS-441 524 could indeed be effective against SARS-CoV-2 in
vivo. In our experiments, tissue concentrations in all measured organs except for the CNS and
fat exceeded the EC50 by more than 10-fold after 60 min (assuming a tissue density of approx.
1 kg/L). Tissue concentrations in those organs were still above 1 µmol/kg after 240 min except
for lungs and nasal mucosa (Table 1). Hence 10 mg/kg every 12 hours would potentially lead
to tissue concentrations exceeding the in vitro EC50 for all tested coronaviridae in most organs
during the greater part of the dosing interval. Low accumulation is expected after multiple
dosing due to the short plasma half-life.
4.2.2

HCQ

In 1983 McChesney described the distribution of chloroquine and HCQ in albino rats in a
qualitative and quantitative way. They found organ concentrations in the following order: bone,
fat, and brain < muscle < eye < heart < kidney< liver < lung < spleen < adrenal tissue [33]. It
was also demonstrated, that tissue accumulation did not reach steady state before seven
months into treating albino rats with 40 mg/kg HCQ per day orally (stomach tube). After 30
weeks of treating albino rats with 7.8 mg/kg per day orally (stomach tube), T/P ranged from
83 (muscle) to 1122 (spleen) with the values for heart, kidney, liver, and lung in between (566,
700, 811, 883) [34].
We could confirm the extensive tissue distribution of HCQ, explaining the frequently reported
high Vz. In general, a high T/P would be desirable for an antiviral drug, since penetration into
tissue is a necessary step for the intracellular uptake. Accumulation in internal organs like

liver, kidney, lungs, and spleen was also observed in our experiments. The disparity between
our T/P and the reported values in albino rats could be mostly contributed to the fact, that our
experiment was based on a single dose and steady state pharmacokinetics have not been
attained. Parts of the central nervous system did not show accumulation of HCQ, which is in
accordance with earlier investigations [33] and may limit its use for the neurological
manifestations potentially caused by SARS-CoV-2 penetration into the brain [28].
Reported in vitro EC50 values for HCQ against vero E6 infected SARS-CoV-2 cells range from
0.72 to 4.51-12.96 µM [35, 36]. With respect to the pronounced T/P, the comparatively high
EC50 values (~ 13µM) could be reached in our mouse model in some tissues (e.g. lungs and
adrenal cortex). However, a multiple of the EC50 value might be necessary for a reliable
antiviral effect. Due to the long terminal half-life and potentially slow tissue distribution (time
to reach steady state in tissue!) sufficiently high concentrations in tissue might not be achieved
in time. This could be one reason for the failure of the 5-day HCQ therapies tested [36]. A
quicker tissue saturation is not feasible due to the comparatively high toxicity of HCQ. A
prophylactic effect of HCQ could be studied infecting the current mouse model after long term
(1-3 weeks) treatment with HCQ (5mg/kg per day) in order to reach high HCQ tissue
concentration at the time of infection.
4.3

In vitro degradation of remdesivir in human plasma

It could be demonstrated, that REM quickly degrades to two major products in plasma in vitro.
One of those degradation products is GS-441 524, the other is the alanine metabolite as an
intermediate. GS-441 524 could only be found in the more sensitive LC-MS/MS approach.
Due to the lack of external standards for the alanine metabolite, we cannot make a statement
regarding the sensitivity in LC-MS/MS (the transition could not be optimized) and therefore not
give a measured concentration. However, using a mass balance approach assuming that no
other degradation products were formed, only a minor percentage (approx. 2.3%) of
remdesivir was converted to GS-441 524 in plasma. If this finding translates to in vivo, the
major part of plasma GS-441 524 originates from redistribution after cellular uptake of

remdesivir and intracellular metabolism rather than hydrolysis in plasma as suggested by Yan
and Muller (vide supra).

Conclusion

We could demonstrate that the mouse model platform is suitable to characterise the PK and
tissue distribution of two extremely different compounds. We could demonstrate that
GS-441 524 is distributed into tissue even if not administered as the prodrug REM. Thus, we
believe that the mouse model and general procedure presented here is a useful tool in the
early investigation of drug candidates targeted against SARS-CoV-2.
