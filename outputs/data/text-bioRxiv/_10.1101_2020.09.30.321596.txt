ABSTRACT
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly transformed into a global pandemic,
for which a demand for developing antivirals capable of targeting the SARS-CoV-2
RNA genome and blocking the activity of its genes has emerged. In this work, we
propose a database of SARS-CoV-2 targets for siRNA approaches, aiming to speed
the design process by providing a broad set of possible targets and siRNA
sequences. Beyond target sequences, it also displays more than 170 features,
including thermodynamic information, base context, target genes and alignment
information of sequences against the human genome, and diverse SARS-CoV-2
strains, to assess whether siRNAs targets bind or not off-target sequences. This
dataset is available as a set of four tables in a single spreadsheet file, each table
corresponding to sequences of 18, 19, 20, and 21 nucleotides length, respectively,

aiming to meet the diversity of technology and expertise among labs around the
world concerning siRNAs design of varied sizes, more specifically between 18 and
21nt length. We hope that this database helps to speed the development of new
target antivirals for SARS-CoV-2, contributing to more rapid and effective responses
to the COVID-19 pandemic.
INTRODUCTION
Started in late December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly
transformed into a global pandemic, with an incidence of more than 30M cases and
almost 1M deaths around the world as of September 20201, and strongly negatively
impacting the global economy (1). This circumstance brought a huge demand for
developing antivirals capable of targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and RNA
interference approaches (2–4) emerged as a possible solution. Small interference
RNA (siRNAs) are RNA sequences about 20nt-long that, together with RNA-Induced
Silencing System (RISC) (6), bind interest mRNA molecules (4, 5) inhibiting its
translation and expression.
RNAi approaches have been employed for SARS-CoV (6–8), with reports of viral
levels decreasing (9), and recent works claim that it may also work for SARS-CoV-2
(10, 11). Researchers in (12) used Immune Epitope Database and Analysis
Resource (IEDB) to find potential regions in diverse coronaviruses with matches to
SARS-CoV-2, identifying many of them in SARS-CoV, the closest homolog. Chen et
al (13) apply a window of 3000 nucleotides with a step of 1500 over reference
SARS-COV-2 genome (MN9089472) seeking 1–25nt regions called “free segments”.
Besides, siRNAs databases targeting a broad range of viruses (14–16) have been
developed. Recently, researchers developed a SARS-CoV-2 oligonucleotide
sequence database, to improve the SARS-CoV-2 detection and treatment methods,
providing sequences with the lowest and highest conservation levels (17).
In this work, we propose a SARS-CoV-2 targets database to support siRNA
approaches, aiming to speed up RNAi design by providing a set of possible targets
and siRNA sequences with the required information for choosing the most
appropriate targets for new siRNAs. Unlikely cited databases, which are manually

curated, we apply a sliding-window approach for covering whole SARS-CoV-2
genomic space, extracting every possible siRNA sequence of 18, 19, 20, and 21
nucleotides, enabling researchers to assess solutions capable of targeting any
region of the virus. The database has more than 170 features, including
thermodynamic information, base context, target genes, and alignment information
against diverse SARS-CoV-2 strains, together with scores and predictions collected
from three siRNA efficiency prediction tools. All this coordinated information will
enable users to select with higher confidence targets that best match a broad set of
conditions for designing even more efficient siRNAs.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Although siRNAs length can vary from 18 to 25 nucleotides (18), synthetic ones
should range from 19 to 21nt (19), according to ThermoFisher siRNA Design
Guidelines3. Thus, the proposed database provides information about each possible
18 to 21 nucleotides siRNA target region from SARS-CoV-2, one table for each
length. Moreover, tools employed for assessing siRNAs efficiency (20–22) operate
over sequences lying in that range, which reinforces our choice. Since they present
the same columns, we explain here the development process only for the 21-length
table.
SARS-CoV-2 reference genome was collected from NCBI (code NC_045512) and
a sliding window of 21nt-long and step 14 were used to traverse the genome. Table 1
indicates the total number of sequences obtained for each length. Seven new
sequences sets were then generated from the obtained sequences set (called target
region), following the aforementioned ThermoFisher guidelines, and suggestions
from our collaborators: (i) natural sense, by removing the first 5’-end dinucleotide
from target region sequences; (ii) oligo natural sense, replacing thymine with uracil
over natural sense set; (iii) synthetic sense, by replacing first 3’-end dinucleotide
from natural sense sequences with TT; (iv) oligo synthetic sense, by replacing of
thymine with uracil over synthetic sense sequences; (v) antisense, from the reverse
complement of target region; (vi) oligo antisense, by replacing thymine with uracil

over antisense sequences; and (vii) oligo antisense rev set, by reversing antisense
sequences.
Natural sense sequences were then aligned against (a) SARS-CoV-2 reference
genome, to verify which genes they align with; (b) the human genome (NCBI
accession code GRCh37) and coding and non-coding transcriptome, to verify
potential cross-reaction with off-target transcripts; (c) SARS-CoV-2 strains available
at GISAID5 initiative coming from Brazil, China (Wuhan region only and whole
country less Wuhan), England, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain and USA; and (d)
reference genomes of MERS virus (NCBI MG987420), SARS-CoV (NCBI
NC_004718) and Influenza virus genome (NCBI NC_026438), aiming to assess
whether siRNAs are capable to target regions from those viruses and strains.
Bowtie6 (23) version 1.1.0 was used as the aligner, using the following flags: -a, -S, -pairtries equals to 4, -p equals to 40, -n equals to 3, -l equals to 7 and -f. Flag -e
was used, being equals to 150 when aligning against the human genome, 10 for
GISAID strains, and 220 for remaining genomes. Sequence properties regarding
base context and alignment information were calculated from the above sequences
sets and performed alignments (see Supplementary Text 1). Thermodynamic
information and expected efficiency of candidates siRNA designed for targeting
those regions was calculated with OligoCalc7 (24) and three predictors, namely
ThermoComposition21 (20), SSD (20, 22), and si-shRNA Selector (21),

RESULTS
Database analysis & statistics
The proposed database displays a total of 119,526 siRNAs divided in four different
sizes ranging from 18 to 21 nucleotides (see Table 1 for the number of siRNAs of
each length). As stated, we applied over them three siRNA efficiency prediction tools
to assess their inhibition power. Figure 1 illustrates the number of 21nt antisense
siRNA sequences predicted as effective by every single predictor, and the quantities
predicted by more than one. It can be seen that no siRNA was unanimously
considered effective, while approximately 53% of them (15,821 siRNAs) were

considered as such just by SSD. Besides that, a single siRNA was predicted as
effective by both ThermoComposition21 and si_shRNA_selector.
We also aligned all siRNAs to the Human genome, Human coding and non-coding
transcriptomes, SARS, MERS, and H1N1 genomes, with Bowtie version 1.1.0,
aiming to identify if siRNAs could off-target regions in those organisms, thus
presenting cross-reactivity with them. Figures 2a-d illustrate the growth of siRNAs
quantities as the minimum number of necessary mismatches to have alignment
increases. The results show that virtually all 18nt siRNAs can match the human
genome and transcriptomes (coding and non-coding) with three mismatches. This
number, however, increases to four considering 19nt and 20nt (Figures 2b and 2c),
and to five considering the 21nt length (Figure 2d). It can also be noted that, in each
length, about 2,500 siRNAs match perfectly with some region of SARS. Regarding
MERS and H1N1, about 2,500 18nt siRNAs can match regions of those viruses,
when the minimum number of allowed mismatches is two (Figure 2a). This number
is only overcome by 19-21nt siRNAs only when the number of mismatches is
increased to three (Figures 2b-d). Finally, it can be observed that while all 18nt and
20nt siRNAs match some regions from MERS, SARS, and H1N1 using at least six
mismatches, the number of mismatches increases to seven for 19nt and 21nt
siRNAs.
Database use and access
The proposed database is distributed as a spreadsheet file containing four tabs,
each one corresponding to target region sequences of a specific length. Here we will
present how a researcher can use this database with an illustrative example.
Suppose a user wants to select siRNAs with 21 nucleotides length. In this case, the
user will access the tab “21 bases” from the spreadsheet file. After opening it in a
spreadsheets editor, the next step is selecting siRNAs whose properties match the
user requirements. Assume that the user wants a siRNA that has little or no
homology with the human genome, can act over as much as possible British SARSCoV-2 strains, and its first dinucleotide is AA. This last requirement is achievable by
applying a filter over column P to show only lines with value 1 on it (see
Supplementary Text 1), decreasing the number of siRNA candidates from 29880 to
2858. For little or no homology with the human genome, the number of mismatches
against human sequences must be at least three (25). Filtering table to display lines

with at least a value of three at columns BO, BP, BQ, CG, CH, CI, CY, CZ, and DA
(Supplementary Text 1) now reduces candidates from 2858 to 999. Finally, to
approach as many British strains as possible, column BY (Supplementary Text 1)
can be filtered to display only the three highest values, for example, which reduces
candidates from 999 to 10 candidates. Such a reduction not only saves wet-lab tests
costs but also ensures that selected siRNAs meet the main user requirements.
DISCUSSION
Designing siRNAs is a challenging procedure, because sometimes minor changes
in its nucleotide sequence can alter its functionality (26). As reported in (27),
specificity, potency, and efficacy of siRNA-mediated gene silencing can be
determined by analyzing siRNA nucleotide sequence, hence its inability to bind to
unintended regions (off-targets) is an important factor that must be strongly taken
into consideration. Therefore, we proposed a SARS-CoV-2 targeted siRNAs
database with sequence and thermodynamic stability information, to help the
evaluation of important factors related to their efficacy and optimize the decision
process towards choosing the best ones as target antiviral solutions. Considering
that each laboratory has its own technology context and expertise in designing
siRNAs of specific lengths, we provide a list of siRNAs varying from 18 to 21
nucleotides-length, aiming to meet the range of possible lengths used in the design
process.
Numerous works have been proposing methods and guidelines for choosing the
best siRNAs by analysing their sequence characteristics (28–31), for which two
broad reviews are available at (26, 32). Our proposed database provides information
regarding base, GC and AU context, so as the quantities of each RNA nitrogenated
base in sequences, besides information about the presence of UUUU and GCCA,
considered toxic motifs (33) So any user with a proper efficacy evaluation method (or
anyone provided by literature) can easily evaluate siRNAs with this database at
disposal. It also provides thermodynamic information collected from the application
of three predictors (20–22), thus enabling users to have a deeper look at siRNAs’
properties, and choose the best ones according to their specificities. As it can be
seen in Figure 1, they have high divergence when setting a siRNA as efficient or not,
which suggests that they must be used in a complementary way. Due to genetic
diversity and variability of SARS-CoV-2 (34), a siRNA that is highly efficient over one

strain may not be when applied to another. Hence, we also provide similarity
information with strains from diverse countries, such that users will benefit from the
opportunity of input geographical specificity and even more customization to their
decision process.
Ensuring that siRNAs are not capable of targeting human sequences (off-targets)
is also another important requirement, for which a minimum of three mismatches is
necessary to meet it (25). Thus, similarity information with the human genome,
coding and non-coding transcriptome, is also available in our database. As it was
shown in the Database Analysis & Statistics session, virtually all 18nt-long siRNAs
matched with such genome and transcriptomes with at least three mismatches,
corroborating aforementioned statement from literature. For the best of our
knowledge, this is the first database to figure siRNAs similarity information against
human coding and non-coding transcriptomes, giving to users even more confidence
power about siRNAs specificity. It is hoped, with this database, that the development
of new target antivirals for SARS-CoV-2 using RNAi technology can be not only
eased and accelerated, but also capable of identifying even more efficient solutions
for silencing that virus, and contributing to the control of the pandemic.
We made available the proposed database as a spreadsheet file given the
urgency to provide this information for the scientific community that is developing
effective therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, it is intended to build a webpage
for more user-friendly and interactive access to the data. Moreover, we also intend to
replicate the approach employed in this work for exploring the genomic space of
other viruses, as well as ones that may represent a threat to possible new pandemic
events.

Supplementary Text 1 - Features description

A set of more than 170 features was calculated for each sequence from target region
together with their derivations in six new sets. The first column, A, provides a
produced ID for the sequence, and columns B, D, E, G, H, J, K, and L, the proper
sequence, and its correspondents in seven sets. Column N indicates SARS-CoV-2
genes contemplated in target region sequence. Columns P to S indicate,
respectively, if the sequence from target region starts with AA, TT, GG, or CC (1 if it
starts, 0 otherwise). Likewise, columns U to X indicate which of AA, TT, CC, and GG
dinucleotides target region sequence ends (1 if it ends, 0 otherwise).

Columns AA to AI contains the following information for oligo natural sense
sequence: columns AA to AD gives the quantities of adenine, uracil, guanine, and
cytosine, respectively; columns AE and AF, GC and AU% content; columns AG and
AH, if tetranucleotides UUUU and GCCA, respectively, are present in sequence (1
for present, 0 otherwise); and column AI, the number of pentamers8 (in the
sequence) that are AU-rich (at least 80% of its composition is AU). This same set of
8

Obtained through a traversing over sequence with a 5-long one step sliding window.

features is also calculated for oligo synthetic sense sequences (columns AL to AT)
and oligo antisense ones (columns AW to BE). Column BG provides AU% content of
the first heptamer from oligo antisense rev sequence, while column BH gives GC%
content from the last heptamer of it.

Columns BJ to BL indicates if there is in natural sense, synthetic sense, and
antisense sequences, respectively, any 6-length palindromic window (1 for true, 0
otherwise). Columns BO to BT presents the minimum number of mismatches
needed for natural sense sequence have homology with the human genome (NCBI
accession code GRCh37) and coding and non-coding transcriptome, MERS genome
(NCBI accession code MG987420), SARS genome (NCBI accession code
NC_004718), and Influenza virus genome (NCBI accession code NC_026438); and
columns BV to CD, the respective number of SARS-CoV-2 strains genomes9 from
Brazil, China (Wuhan region only), China (without Wuhan region), England,
Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain and USA that natural sense sequence has homology
with. Columns CG to CV replicate this information set for synthetic sense; and CY to
DN, for antisense sequence.
Columns DQ to DZ bring thermodynamic information provided by OligoCalc10 (1) to
oligo natural sense, namely, melting temperature, melting temperature adjusted
considering a Na+ concentration of 50mM, melting temperature calculated as
described in (2) using the values available in (3), product between general gas
constant R and natural logarithm of 1 over primer concentration, sequence
(change of oligonucleotide’s free energy), sequence

(change of enthalpy),

(change of entropy), number of potential hairpin sites, number of

potential self-annealing sites, and whether sequence 3’ have self-complementarity (1
if yes, 0 otherwise). Columns EC to EL replicate this information set for oligo
synthetic sense sequence, and columns EO to EX, for oligo antisense sequence.

Columns FA to FJ bring efficiency score and thermodynamic information provided by
ThermoComposition21 program (4) to natural sense sequence, namely, predicted
effectiveness11, number of GG dinucleotides present in the sequence, and a set of
eight thermodynamic indexes (measured in ΔG) calculated by the tool which is used
for effectiveness prediction. Columns FM to FV replicate this information set for
synthetic sense sequence, and columns FY to GH, for antisense sequence.
Column GJ provides predicted efficiency12 from SSD program (5) over natural sense
sequence, and columns GL to GO, a set of four thermodynamic indexes (measured
in

ΔG)

calculated by the tool for natural sense sequence, which are used for

effectiveness prediction. Columns GR to GU replicate this information set for
synthetic sense sequence, and columns GX to HA, for antisense sequence.

Finally, columns HD to HF bring efficiency prediction and thermodynamic information
provided by software si-shRNA Selector program (6) to natural sense sequence,
namely, predicted efficiency13 and a set of two thermodynamic indexes (measured in

ΔG) calculated by the tool which are used for effectiveness prediction. Columns HI to
HK replicate this information set for synthetic sense sequence, and columns HN to
HP, for antisense sequence.
