Abstract
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan city,
China in December 2019 and thereafter its spillover across the world has created a global pandemic
and public health crisis. Today, it appears as a threat to human civilization. Scientists and medical
practitioners across the world are involved to trace out the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2
(also called 2019 novel coronavirus and referred as 2019-nCoV), its transmission route, cause of
pathogenicity, and possible remedial action. In this work, we aim to find out the origin, evolutionary
pattern that led to its pathogenicity and possible transmission pathway of 2019-nCoV. To achieve the
aims we conducted a large-scale deep phylogenetic analysis on the 162 complete
Orthocoronavirinae

genomes

consisting

of

four

genera

namely

Alphacoronavirus,

Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus, their gene trees analysis and
subsequently genome and gene recombination analyses. Our analyses revealed that i) bat, pangolin
and anteater are the natural hosts of 2019-nCoV, ii) outbreak of 2019-nCoV took place via inter-intra
species transmission mode, iii) host-specific adaptive mutation made 2019-nCoV more virulent, and
iv) the presence of widespread recombination events led to the evolution of new 2019-nCoV strain
and/or could be determinant of its pathogenicity.

Keywords: Orthocoronavirinae; 2019-nCoV; Genome/Gene phylogeny; Adaptive mutation;
Recombination; Transmission pathway, COVID-19

Introduction
Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA virus of 26 to 32 kilobases (kb) nucleotide chain and
consists of both structural and non-structural proteins. They have been known to cause lower and
upper respiratory diseases, central nervous system infection and gastroenteritis in a number of
avian and mammalian hosts, including humans (Gorbalenya et al 2020). The recent outbreak of
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-COV-2) associated with acute respiratory disease called
coronavirus disease 19 (commonly known as COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic and has
spread over 212 countries (WHO, COVID-19 situation report). As of now, more than 4 million
people have been infected and approximately 300 thousand people have died. Today, COVID-19
appears as a global threat to public health as well as to the human civilization (WHO, COVID-19
situation reports). As it was initially outbreak in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China in December
2019 but then rapidly spread to several European countries and subsequently almost the entire
world (Wu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2019).

Coronaviruses are placed within the family Coronaviridae, which has two subfamilies namely
Orthocoronavirinae and Torovirinae. Orthocoronavirinae has four genera: Alphacoronavirus
(average genome size 28kb), Betacoronavirus (average genome size 30kb), Gammacoronavirus
(average genome size 28kb), and Deltacoronavirus (average genome size 26kb) (de Groot et al.
2011). Coronaviruses are typically harbored in mammals and birds. Particularly Alphacoronavirus
and Betacoronavirus infect mammals, and Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus infect avian
species (Woo et al., 2009; 2010; Fan et al., 2019).

The previous important outbreaks of coronaviruses are severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in China in 2002/03, Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012 that resulted severe epidemics in the respective
geographical regions (Eickmann et al., 2003; Vijaykrishna et al., 2007; Zumla et al, 2015; Hayes et
al., 2019). The present outbreak of 2019-nCoV is the third documented spillover of an animal
coronavirus to humans in only two decades that has resulted in a major pandemic (Velavan and
Meyer, 2020; Lai et al., 2020). Despite the deadly infection caused by 2019-nCoV, till are no specific
vaccines or medicines for COVID-19.

Scientific communities across the world are trying to understand several fundamental and applied
questions such as: What is the origin of 2019-nCoV? What are the possible transmission routes? Why
2019-nCoV is more deadly than other CoVs? What is its possible clinical diagnosis & treatment?
etc. Consequently, a large number of research outcomes are being consistently published. In this
paper, we aim to find out the origin and evolution of 2019-nCoV, and its possible transmission
pathway through deep phylogenetic analysis.

Materials and Methods
Data selection
162 Orthocoronavirinae genomes were retrieved from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
and Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (https://www.viprbrc.org/). We only
considered complete genome sequences having no unidentified nucleotide characters. Our
dataset included 23 Alphacoronavirus, 92 Betacoronavirus, 32 Deltacoronavirus and 15
Gammacoronavirus genomes from different subgenera, diverse host species and from wide
geographical location (Cui et al., 2019). Further for rooting the tree, we used two genome
sequences from Torovirus and two from Bafinivirus belonging to domestic cow and fish
respectively. Three random sequences were generated by using the average genome length of the
Orthocoronavirinae genomes and their average GC%. The random sequences were used to
check the reliability of the topology. Overall, the phylogenetic analysis consists of 162 complete
Orthocoronavirinae genomes; four outgroups sequences and three random sequences.

Phylogenetic reconstruction
The genome sequences were aligned using the MAFFT alignment tool (Katoh et al., 2002).
Genome tree of the Orthocoronavirinae and Betacoronavirus were reconstructed using maximum
likelihood (ML) method and GTR+G+I model of sequence evolution as revealed by the model test
with 1000 bootstrap support. Trees were reconstructed using IQ-TREE software (Nguyen et al.,
2015) and were visualized with iTOL software (Letunic et al., 2019). Five gene trees namely
Orf1ab, Spike (S), Membrane (M), Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) were reconstructed using
amino acid sequences. ML method of tree reconstruction and protein-specific amino acids

evolution model as revealed by the model test was used for gene trees reconstruction. Bootstrap
test with 1000 bootstrap replicates was carried out to check the reliability of the gene trees.

Genome and gene recombination analysis
Potential recombination events in the history of the Betacoronaviros were assessed using the RDP5
package (Martin et al., 2015). The RDP5 analysis was conducted based on the complete genome
sequence using RDP, GENECONV, BootScan, MaxChi, Chimera, SiScan, and 3Scan methods.
Putative recombination events were identified with a Bonferroni corrected P-value cut-off of 0.05
supported by more than four methods.

Results and Discussion
The genome phylogeny of Orthocoronavirinae depicts that Alpha, Beta, Delta and Gamma
coronaviruses clustered according to their cladistic relations (Fig. 1). This result is consistent with
the other results (Luk et al. 2019; Wu et al., 2020). Furthermore, Gammacoronavirus and
Deltacoronavirus appeared in a single clade (i.e. formed a monophyletic group). Interestingly
Betacoronavirus appeared as paraphyletic clade to the Gamma-Delta monophyletic clade.
Alphacoronavirus emerged as a basal radiation of the Orthocoronavirinae phylogeny. Further,
deep analysis of the genome tree revealed that the same host strains from different geographical
location of Alphacoronaviruses are conserved (Li et al., 2020). This is probably due to the host
specific adaptive mutations (Songa et al., 2005; Andersen et al., 2020). For example,

Orthocoronavirinae genomes, four outgroups and three random sequences. Alignment consists of
65,157bp aligned nucleotide characters (5,769bp completely aligned characters). Tree was
reconstructed using ML method with GTR+G+I model of nucleotide evolution along with 1000
bootstrap replicates (asterisk at the nodes represent support values >70%). Tree was rooted with
the four Torovirinae genomes. Most recent common ancestors (MRCA) are the closely related
ancestor group from 2019-nCoV.

Alphacoronavirus strains from ferret Japan and ferret Netherland is monophyletic. Similarly cat UK is
monophyletic to cat Netherland, and human China is monophyletic to human Netherland. Another
interesting outcome is all Alphacoronavirus camel strains of Saudi Arabia appeared in a distinct subclade where bat Ghana appeared as outgroup which clearly indicates interspecies transmission took
place from bat (Ghana) to camel followed by adaptive mutation (York, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020).
Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus clade clearly exhibits a similar evolutionary pattern. In
case of Deltacoronaviruses, swine Vietnam and swine Hong Kong share a single common ancestor.
Similarly, swine China and swine South Korea are monophyletic clade and swine Japan is
monophyletic to swine South Korea. In case of Gammacoronaviruses (whose natural hosts are
avian species), chicken Peru and chicken Uruguay shared a single common ancestor. Similarly,
chicken Iraq is monophyletic to chicken Egypt strain. These results clearly confirm that coronavirus
strains are present in a large number of hosts those are widespread in different geographical
location.

In this work, we considered 92 complete Betacoronavirus genomes belonging to five subgenera
namely Embecovirus, Hibecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirus and Sarbecovirus (2019nCoV/SARS-COV-2 belongs to this group). Phylogenetic analysis of Betacoronavirus genomes
revealed that the five subgenera clustered separately (Fig. 2). Further, the Betacoronavirus genome
tree depicts that the host-specific strains from distance geographical locations formed
monophyletic clades. For example, in Embecovirus clade, strain BJ01 P9 human China is
monophyletic to the Caen1 human France strain.

Similarly, Embecovirus B1 24F buffalo

Bangladesh is monophyletic to BCV AKS 01 cattle China. This result infers that irrespective of the
hosts’ geographical location/diversity host-specific adaptive mutation occurred.

Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) belongs to Sarbecovirus subgenus (Fig. 2). Sarbecoviruses formed
three distinct clades, where Clade 1 consists of only bat as host species. In Clade 2, host species are
bat, human and civet. Similarly, in Clade 3 the host species are bat, human, pangolin and anteater, and
it depicts bat-CoV-RaTG13 (NCBI Acc no. Mn996532) is closest to CoV humans, which was
evolved by the recombination of bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45 strains.

The clades

analysis clearly asserts bat, pangolin and anteater are the natural reservoir of 2019-nCoV, and
transmission from bat /pangolin/anteater to humans took place through intermediate organisms (Cui
et al., 2019; York, 2020). Furthermore, this phylogenetic tree reveals Betacoronavirus sequences are
conserved in their respective hosts after acquiring adaptive mutation (e.g. all bat hosts clustered in
Clade 2 and human hosts are in Clade 3) (Lu et al., 2020).

In addition to genome phylogeny, gene tree analysis was also conducted as it provides a more
reliable basis for studying genome evolution. Five gene trees namely orf1ab, spike (S), envelope (E),
Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) were used for gene tree analysis (Figs. 3-7). Except N gene
tree (Fig. 6), other four gene trees have shown similar evolutionary pattern with respect to their
subgenera and were in concordance with their genome tree. This observation implies that the
Betacoronavirus genome evolution is influenced by the genes’ evolution. Further deep analysis
found, though subgenera-wise four gene trees are similar, but within subgenera there are
widespread phylogenetic incongruences (Jeffroy et al., 2006). This result led us to hypothesize that
HGTs and/or recombination had occurred among Betacoronaviruses in the past that are caused to
evolve new strains including the emergence of pathogenic lineages. However, it was found that N
gene tree has significant topological difference with other gene trees. This might be possible as gene
tree differs species tree for various analytical and/or biological reasons (Degman et al., 2009; Som,
2013; 2015).

We conducted both genome (Betacoronavirus) and gene recombination analysis using RDP5
package (Martin et al., 2015). The genome recombination analysis detected 21 putative
recombination signals (Table 1). Recombination results show that major recombination events took
place between Clade 2 and Clade 3 of Sarbecovirus (Table 1). Gene recombination analysis found
there are widespread recombination events in orf1ab and S proteins (Table 2). M and N proteins
reported few recombination events and envelope (E) protein did not show any recombination event.
Major genetic variations in these genes, particularly in spike (S) gene, seemed essential for the
transition from animal-to-human transmission to human-to-human transmission, which eventually
caused the outbreak of 2019-nCoV (Su et al., 2016; Luk et al. 2019; Jaimes et al., 2020). Details of
the genome and gene recombination analyses are given in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively.
It was found that the most closely related bat and SARS-CoVs diverged in 1986, an estimated
divergence time of 17 years prior to the outbreak in December 2002 (Vijaykrishna et al., 2007). In
a similar line, a recent article by Lu et al. (2020) reported that intermediate transmission happened
long back of 2019-nCoV outbreak in December 2019. Incidentally 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2)
outbreak also happened in the same time interval of 17 years in 2019 and also in the same winter
season. Further, evolutionary studies have shown that 2019-nCoV is genetically distance from
SARS-CoVs with 88~96% sequence similarity between them (Ceraolo and Giorgi, 2020; Lu et al.,
2020). So the open question is which factors made 2019-nCoV is highly pathogenic: mutation,
recombination, structural changes of spike protein, combination of multiple factors, or something
else which needs to be explored. Thus, further studies on detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genomes,
particularly the spike protein sequences and structures, as well as the receptors for the individual
novel coronaviruses will enable to understand the origin, pathogenicity and mechanism behind
interspecies jumping at the molecular level, which will help in the prevention of future zoonotic
events.

Concluding remarks
In this work we performed a large-scale genome and gene phylogenetic analyses of the 162 full
Orthocoronavirinae genomes and their five protein sequences. Our analysis revealed that: i) bat,
pangolin and anteater are the natural reservoir host of Betacoronavirus, ii) transmission of Beta
coronavirus to human took place by inter-intra species model (i.e. from bat/pangolin/anteater to
intermediate organism and then from intermediate organism to human), iii) host–specific adaptive
mutation occurred among the coronavirus strains including 2019-nCoV, iv) gene tree and gene
recombination analysis confirmed the widespread presence of recombination events, and v)
genome recombination analysis found that recombination events between intra-subgenera are
more frequent than inter-subgenera, which possibly led to the evolution of new strains such as
2019-nCov/SARS-CoV-2.
