Abstract:
COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has
rapidly spread throughout the world with unprecedented global healthcare and socioeconomic consequences. There is now an established secondary syndrome of COVID-19
characterised by thrombosis, vascular dysfunction and hypertension, seen in those most
severely affected. Advancing age in adults is the single most significant risk factor for
hospitalisation and death with COVID-19. In light of the cardiovascular/thrombotic sequalae
associated with severe COVID-19 disease and the overwhelming risk that increased age
carries, in this study, our aim was to obtain mechanistic insight by interrogating gene
expression profiles in cardiovascular tissues and cells. Our focus was on the two putative
receptors for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 and BSG along with a selected range of genes thought to be
involved in virus binding/processing. In this study we have made four important observations:
(i) Cardiovascular tissues and/or endothelial cells express the required genes for SARS-CoV-2
infection, (ii) SASR-CoV-2 receptor pathways, ACE2/TMPRSS2 and BSG/PPIB(A) polarise to
lung/epithelium and vessel/endothelium respectively, (iii) expression of SARS-CoV-2 host
genes are, on the whole, relatively stable with age and (iv) notable exceptions were ACE2
which decreases with age in some tissues and BSG which increases with age in endothelial
cells. Our data support the idea that that BSG is the dominate pathway utilised by SARS-CoV2 in endothelial cells and are the first to demonstrate a positive correlation with age. We
suggest BSG expression in the vasculature is a critical driver which explains the heightened
risk of severe disease and death observed in those >40 years of age. Since BSG is utilised by
other pathogens our findings have implications beyond the current pandemic. Finally,
because BSG is functions in a range of cardiovascular diseases and fibrosis, our observations
may have relevance to our understanding of the diseases associated with aging.

Introduction:
COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was
first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 is relatively contagious and
whilst producing mild symptoms in the majority of people, can progress to severe or fatal
disease in susceptible individuals. As such the virus has rapidly spread throughout the world
with unprecedented global healthcare and socio-economic consequences.
SARS-CoV-2 is related to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV) which caused respiratory epidemics in 2003 and 2012 respectively. Based on what was
known about human host interactions with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV along with recent
research using SARS-CoV-2 tools, a list of key entry and processing genes utilised by the virus
to infect host cells has been defined. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells by binding of the spike
protein with two putative receptors; ACE21 and BSG (also known as Basigin, CD147 or
EMMPRIN)2,3. For viral entry by ACE2, it is thought that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is primed
and ACE2 cleaved, by the cellular serine proteases TMPRSS21 and ADAM17. FURIN cleaves
viral enveloping proteins providing another putative priming step for the spike protein of
SARS-COV-24. For viral entry via BSG, less is known regarding specific receptor/viral processing
partners for SARS-CoV-2. However, for SARS-CoV5, HIV6 and the measles virus7, respectively,
peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA; also knowns as cyclophilin A) and peptidylprolyl isomerase
B (PPIB; also known as cyclophilin B), which are natural ligands for BSG, incorporate into virus
and facilitate binding to BSG. Similarly, PPIB forms a complex with the malaria pathogen
(Plasmodium falciparum merozoites) and BSG to facilitate infection of red blood cells8.
Intracellular processing of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is thought to involve the lysosomal
cysteine proteases cathepsin B/L (CTSL, CTSB) which, can also substitute for TMPRSS2 in some
cells1.
Initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurs via the respiratory epithelium; high gene expression
of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in nasal epithelium9,10 have been taken to imply that the nose is a
primary entry point for the virus9. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are also co-expressed in bronchial
epithelium9-11. However, where COVID-19 progresses to severe disease the lung and other
organs are also affected. The emerging pattern of severe and fatal COVID-19 disease includes
pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine storm, widespread

vasculopathy, thrombosis, renal failure, hypertension and endothelial dysregulation seen
across multiple vascular beds and organ systems12,13. Furthermore, COVID-19 is associated
with an increased risk of arterial thrombosis14,15 and venous thromboembolism with
pulmonary embolism16,17, both likely to represent an important source of acute and postCOVID-19 morbidity and mortality. While hypertension and thrombosis are common features
after COVID-1918,19, the important question as to whether COVID-19 as an independent risk
factor for cardiovascular disease in the acute setting and during the recovery period, is a
concern and remains to be established. Similarly the rates of post-COVID-19 pulmonary
fibrosis remain unknown but at discharge the vast majority of patients with COVID-19 have
evidence of persisting pulmonary infiltrates on computerised tomography scans20 and almost
half have physiological impairment21. This secondary thrombotic/vascular clinical syndrome
of severe COVID-19 suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infects not only respiratory epithelium but also
the endothelium disrupting barrier function and allowing access to cardiovascular tissues and
other organs of the body22. This idea is supported by reports showing that SARS-COV-2 can
infect endothelial cells in vitro23 and that coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 can progress to
a systemic infection24,25 with some patients showing detectable viral RNA in blood samples 2628

.

The reasons that underpin progression of mild to severe or fatal COVID-19 disease remain
incompletely understood but risk factors have been defined29; these include established
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and black and minority ethnicity [BAME]. However,
the dominant risk factor for severe COVID-19 across all datasets is age, with the vast majority
of those in hospital with COVID-19 disease being over 40 years. Indeed, a recent disparities
in outcomes report by Public Health England found age to be the largest disparity with
likelihood of death in adults increasing in an age-dependent manner from around 40 years30.
Importantly, while positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection increase with age the relative rate
of infection between adult age groups profoundly underpredicts the effect of advancing age
on the risk of death from COVID-1929,30. Therefore, understanding how SARS-CoV-2 causes
severe disease with pulmonary, thrombotic, cardiorenal and vascular complications is
critically important in managing the pandemic and identifying therapeutic strategies.

While some studies report expression profiles of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in epithelial cells9,11 and
immune cells10,11, expression patterns of a wider range of host SARS-CoV-2 entry and
processing genes in these cells has was recently reported11. However, the relative expression
levels of SARS-CoV-2 entry and processing genes in vessels and in endothelial cells has not
been fully established. Finally, the impact of age on the expression of these genes in a
cardiovascular setting is incompletely understood.
Here we have used publicly available gene expression data to determine the relative
expression of key SARS-CoV-2 host entry/ processing genes in human cardiovascular tissues
including aorta, coronary artery, heart (atria and left ventricle), whole blood and the kidney
and for comparison the colon, spleen and lung. We went on to investigate gene expression in
endothelial cells and, for comparison, airway (nasal and bronchial) epithelium and leukocytes
(peripheral blood mononuclear cells; PBMCs). We used blood outgrowth endothelial cells as
a model because, since they are obtained from blood samples of living donors, data sets
across age ranges have been created. Furthermore, blood outgrowth endothelial cells are an
accepted model for application in personalised medicine since they retain elements of disease
phenotype across a number of cardiovascular and other conditions31-33. After mapping gene
expression across our target tissues and cells, our primary objective was to determine how
age, as the single most dominant risk factor for severe COVID-19, impacts on expression of
SARS-CoV-2 entry and processing genes in human cardiovascular and other tissues.

Methods:
Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) analysis
The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project34 is an ongoing effort to build a
comprehensive public resource to study tissue-specific gene expression and. We downloaded
gene expression data from GTEx version 8 (https://www.gtexportal.org/home/datasets)
which contain expression data from 54 tissues from 948 donors. We identified tissues of
interest based on organ systems affected by severe COVID-19 disease and extracted
expression data specifically from those tissues. Tissues were split into two categories; (i)
cardiovascular tissues including aorta, coronary artery, heart (atrial and appendage), left
ventricle, kidney (cortex) and whole blood and (ii) ‘other tissues’ including lung, colon and
spleen. We performed principle component analysis (PCA) on gene expression data from each
tissue of interest. We observed that the major variation in gene expression was due to type
of death (Hardy Score; Supplementary Figure 1) and so corrected for this. We normalised the
gene expression data for each tissue separately using COMBAT-seq35 with Hardy score as a
batch. After normalisation expression data was extracted for our target genes (ACE, ACE2,
ADAM17, BSG, CTSB, CTSL, FURIN, PPIA, PPIB and TMPRSS2). The following number of donors
were identified for each tissues; aorta (432), coronary artery (240), atrial appendage (429),
left ventricle (432), kidney cortex (85), whole blood (755), lung (578), colon (779) and spleen
(241). Age identifiers in GTEx are grouped by decade, as such results were analysed based on
samples that associated with 20-29 to 70-79 years of age. Principle component analysis (PCA)
plots of raw and processed GTEx data is presented in Supplementary Figure 1.
Gene expression dataset systematic review analysis
Using ArrayExpress and NCBI GEO we identified the raw datasets (.CEL files) of transcriptomic
gene expression profiling by microarray of healthy adult donors for blood outgrowth
endothelial cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bronchial airway (obtained
from bronchial brushing) and nasal (obtained nasal brushing) epithelium. We applied strict
inclusion criteria; (i) only datasets that used Affymetrix Gene Chips (.CEL files) were included,
(ii) only datasets where individual ages are defined were included and (iii) only datasets for
‘untreated’ cells were included. The following studies and number of donors were identified
(see Supplementary Table 1); blood outgrowth endothelial cells; 3 studies with 63 donors,

PBMCs; 6 studies with 84 donors, airway (bronchial) epithelium; 2 studies with 74 donors and
nasal epithelium; 3 studies with 111 donors.
Transcriptomic expression profiling of cell data
Raw (.CEL) files were imported into Partek Flow® software and aligned with STAR to the
human assembly (hg19) whole genome. The data was quantified to an annotation model
using ‘Ensembl Transcripts release 75’ and normalised to ‘Counts Per Million’ and filtered to
remove genes below the reliable quantitation threshold. The gene expression values from
different studies were merged based on gene names. To correct for the batch effects, the
data was normalised using the empirical Bayes model ComBat36. The normalised expression
values of our target genes (ACE2, CYPA, CYPB, BSG, ADAM17, TMPRSS2, FURIN, CTSB and
CTSL) were then extracted for further downstream analysis. PCA plots of raw and processed
cell data is presented in Supplementary Figure 1.
Statistical analysis:
All data were analysed on GraphPad Prism v8 and are shown as mean +/- SEM for samples
from ‘n’ = individual donors. Data were grouped into two groups; samples from adults below
the age of 40 and above the age of 40. Data were tested for normality of distribution and
analysed using parametric (Student T-test) or non-parametric (Mann Whitney U-test) tests as
appropriate as a discovery exercise. Where p<0.05 follow on correlation tests were
performed using Pearson’s, for continuous variables (cell data), or Spearman’s, for ordinal
variables (tissue data), tests. Details of tests used are given in individual figure legends.

Results:
We quantified nine SARS-CoV-2 entry and processing genes (ACE2, BSG, ADAM17, TMTRSS2,
CYPA, CYPB, CTSB, CTSL and FURIN) (Figure 1 and Figure 2) along with ACE in cardiovascular
tissues (including kidney and whole blood) and other organs (including lung spleen and colon),
(Figure 1) and in endothelial cells, respiratory epithelial cells and in PBMCs (Figure 2). ACE is
not directly related to cellular processing of the virus but represents a pharmacological link
with ACE2.
Relative expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes across organs (Figure 1 and Figure 3)
As expected, ACE was highly expressed in the lung37 with lower but consistent levels
expressed across other tissues and with very low levels present in blood. Of the two putative
SARS-CoV-2 receptors, BSG was highly expressed across all tissues with higher levels seen in
most cardiovascular tissues than in the lung or spleen. ACE2, across all tissues, was expressed
in relatively low levels. However, cardiovascular tissues including kidney, heart and blood
vessel (coronary artery) expressed higher levels of ACE2 than the lung or spleen. Relatively
low levels of ACE2 were seen in whole blood. The colon was positioned mid group for both
BSG and ACE2 expression. Of the putative processing genes, required for spike protein
conditioning and/or cleavage of ACE2 allowing viral entry, ADAM17 and FURIN were each
enriched in the lung with relatively stable levels of expression across cardiovascular and other
target tissues. TMPRSS2 was also enriched in the lung, colon and kidney cortex with very low
levels present in arteries, heart, spleen and blood. For the putative vial partner ligands of BSG,
PPIA and PPIB, both were expressed throughout our selected tissues with higher levels
expressed in arteries than kidney, blood or heart tissues. Lung, spleen and colon expressed
high or midranking levels of PPIA and PPIB. The endosomal proteases, CTSB and CTSL showed
similar expression patterns across our tissues of interest. Both CTSB and CTSL were enriched
in the lung and spleen (CTSB) with relatively high levels across all tissues. CTSB and CTSL were
more highly expressed in arteries than kidney, heart or blood.
Relative expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes in endothelial cells versus airway epithelium
and PBMCs (Figure 2 and Figure 3)
To complement and extend the above organ-level approach we focussed on endothelial cells
versus respiratory epithelial cell types and immune cells (PBMCs), in line with COVID-19

disease pathology. As expected, ACE was highly enriched in endothelial cells38 with lower
levels present in PBMCs, bronchial and nasal epithelium. BSG was enriched in endothelial cells
and PBMCs with lower levels expressed in nasal and bronchial airway epithelium. ACE2 was
enriched in nasal epithelium flowed by endothelial cells and lower levels in PBMCs and
bronchial epithelium. ADAM17 was highly enriched in PBMCs followed by endothelial cells
and nasal and bronchial epithelial cells. FURIN was enriched in endothelial cells with midranking levels expressed in PBMCs and lower levels in nasal and bronchial epithelium;
TMPRSS2 was highly enriched in nasal epithelial cells followed by bronchial epithelial cells,
endothelial cells and PBMCs. PPIA and PPIB were highly expressed in endothelial cells with
lower levels in PBMCs, nasal and bronchial epithelial cells. Intracellular proteases CTSB and
CTSL were both also enriched in endothelial cells followed by airway epithelium (CTSB,
nasal>bronchial; CTSL, bronchial>nasal) and low levels in PBMCs.
Next, in line with recent Public Health England’s review of disparities in risks and outcomes
for COVID-1917, we grouped data into two age categories, <40 and >40 years to determine
differences in gene expression. Where differences were found and based on clinical evidence
showing that the risk of death from COVID-19 directly correlates with age19, we performed
follow-on correlation analysis.
Effect of age on expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes across cardiovascular and COVID-19
target tissues
Arteries:
In the aorta, FURIN and PPIB were increased while ACE2 was deceased in samples from adults
>40 years of age (Figure 3). Reductions of ACE2 or increases of PPIB linearly correlated with
age (Figure 4; Supplementary Figure 2). FURIN expression did not linearly correlate with age
(Supplementary Figure 2). None of our selected genes were affected by age in the coronary
artery (Figure 3).
Heart and Kidney:
In the heart (atria and left ventricle) or kidney none of our selected genes were affected by
age (Figure 3).

Whole Blood:
In whole blood ACE expression increased while ACE2 and ADAM17 were reduced in samples
from individuals >40 years of age (Figure 3; Figure 4; Supplementary Figure 4). Of these genes
reduced expression of ACE2 (Figure 4) and ADAM17 and increased expression of ACE linearly
correlated with age (Supplementary Figure 4).
Colon:
In the colon ACE2, ADAM17 and TMPRSS2 were decreased in samples from individuals >40
years of age (Figure 3; Figure 4; Supplementary Figure 5). Of these genes, reduced expression
levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 but not ADAM17 linearly correlated with age (Supplementary
Figure 5).
Lung:
In the lung expression levels of CTSL and PPIA were decreased in samples from adults >40
years of age (Figure 3). Reduced expression linearly correlated with age for PPIA but not CTSL
(Supplementary Figure 6).
Spleen:
None of our studied genes were altered with age in the spleen (Figure 3).
Effect of age on expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes in endothelial cells, airway cells and
leukocytes
In endothelial cells BSG, but not other genes, was increased in samples from adults >40 years
(Figure 3 and Figure 5; Supplementary Figure 7) and levels showed a positive linear correlation
with age (Figure 5). By contrast, only ACE was fractionally (but statistically significantly)
reduced in nasal epithelium between age categories (Figure 3; Supplementary Figure 8) and
this did not linearly correlate with age (Supplementary Figure 9). No genes were altered in
bronchial epithelium (Supplementary Figure 10) and PBMCs (Supplementary Figure 11) with
age (Figure 3).

Summary:
In light of the cardiovascular/thrombotic sequalae associated with severe COVID-19 disease
and the overwhelming risk that increased age carries, our aim was to obtain mechanistic
insight by interrogating gene expression profiles in cardiovascular tissues and cells. Our focus
was on the two putative receptors for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 and BSG along with a selected range
of genes thought to be involved in virus binding/processing. In this study we have made four
important observations: (i) Cardiovascular tissues and/or endothelial cells express the
required genes for SARS-CoV-2 infection, (ii) SASR-CoV-2 receptor pathways, ACE2/TMPRSS2
and BSG/PPIB(A) polarise to lung/epithelium and vessel/endothelium respectively, (iii)
expression of SARS-CoV-2 host genes are, on the whole, relatively stable with age and (iv)
notable exceptions were ACE2 which decreases with age in some tissues and BSG which
increases with age in endothelial cells.
Discussion:
Initial SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs in the airways. For most people infection is either
asymptomatic or associated with mild symptoms consistent with localised viral infection in
respiratory tissues. Naturally, therefore, most research to date has focused on investigations
in the lung or airway cells and understanding how to manage the complications of pneumonia
and ventilation failure. However, in some individuals SARS-CoV-2 infection progresses to
severe COVID-19 disease, which is a systemic illness with complications specifically associated
with the cardiorenal system, endothelium and thrombosis. Now, understanding the vascular
component of severe COVID-19 disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is emerging as
an urgent unmet clinical need.
Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 receptors and processing genes are expressed across all
cardiovascular target tissues and/or in endothelial cells, supporting the idea that systemic
organs contain the required machinery to be infected by the virus. In regard to the two SARSCoV-2 receptor pathways; expression levels of ACE2 were higher in cardiovascular tissues
than the lung. By contrast, TMPRSS2, thought to be required for SARS-CoV-2 infection in
epithelial cells, was present in lung colon and kidney but essentially absent in other
cardiovascular tissues (heart, vessels and whole blood). Our findings describing the relative

levels of these genes in human tissues are in line with others using similar approaches for
ACE239-43 and TMPRSS241,44. Moreover, we found that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were enriched
in nasal epithelium with low levels in bronchial epithelium and PBMCs which is in agreement
with recent work from others (nasal versus bronchial epithelium9,10 and versus PBMCs10).
Radzikowsa et al., profiled a wider range of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes in immune cells and
differentiated primary bronchial epithelial cells and also reported relatively high levels of
expression of PPIA, BSG, PPIB with much lower levels of TMPRSS2 followed by ACE2 in airway
cells11. However, our focus was on the cardiovascular system. Importantly we found
endothelial cells to express much lower levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 than nasal epithelium
but higher levels than those expressed in PBMCs. Nevertheless, in contrast to the
ACE2/TMPRSS2 pathway genes, BSG and PPIB were expressed in higher levels in vessels and
endothelial cells than in the lung and airway epithelial cells. Together our findings suggest
that SARS-Cov-2 and other relevant viruses exploit BSG as a receptor pathway in the
vasculature. Our findings align with recent work by Ganier and colleagues45 and add evidence
to the recent ‘proposed mechanism’ explaining how SARS-CoV-2 accesses endothelial cells,
presented by Acosta Saltos and Acosta Saltos46.
Severe COVID-19 is exceptionally rare in children. In adults the strongest risk factor for severe
disease and death is age, with those under 40 years being at very low risk; the risk of severe
COVID-19 disease and death increases proportionally after the age of 4030. Of the genes that
we studied, several candidates, including ACE2, were affected by age but with the exception
of BSG in endothelial cells and PPIB and FURIN in aorta, expression was reduced in those >40.
We found consistent age-related reductions in ACE2 in whole blood, aorta and in the colon.
Our findings are in line with those published by Chen and co-workers who also reported a
negative correlation between ACE2 and age in a range of tissues including colon and blood39.
Moreover, our work corroborates earlier studies showing that ACE2 (protein) declines with
age in mouse aorta47. Other studies in rats also showed that ACE2 declines with age in the
lung and kidney48,49. It should be noted, however, that Li and colleagues found no effect of
age on ACE2 expression across a similar selection of tissues43 and that Santesmasses and
colleagues found that ACE2 expression increased with age in the lung50. We also found a trend
for ACE2 to increase in the lung but this did not reach statistical significance in our study. Key

differences between the studies include the analytical approaches applied, the number of
tissues selected, and the age groups used.
Since ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which declines with age in some settings (this
study)43,47-49 and because age is the strongest predictor for fatal COVID-19 disease a paradox
has emerged51: SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression does not positively correlate with high risk
groups of severe COVID-19 disease. One explanation of the paradox has been that because
ACE2 is a cardioprotective enzyme, while ACE2 is the receptor for airway infection of SARSCoV-2, low levels of ACE2 in the circulation of the elderly and those with cardiovascular
disease increases the risk of cardiovascular complications associated with severe COVID-19
disease51. Additionally, it has been hypothesised that BSG acts as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2
in endothelial cells46. BSG expression is increased in a range of cardiovascular diseases which
could compensate for any age/disease associated reductions in ACE2 in regard to viral
infection. In line with this in our study, BSG positively correlated with age and this association
was only seen in endothelial cells. Others have found that BSG increases with age in the skin52.
It is not clear why we did not see age related increases in BSG in the aorta or coronary artery
or in organ samples. One explanation could be that in vessels the delicate lining of the
endothelium may have been lost during tissue dissection and/or that the age effects on BSG
expression in endothelial cells is diluted out in complex tissues by expression levels in other
cells which make up the bulk of the samples. It should also be considered that whilst blood
outgrowth endothelial cells display key ubiquitous features of endothelial cells and retain
disease phenotypes31, heterogeneity exists within endothelial cells as they age with passage
and in different vascular beds.
Based on our findings together the cardiovascular, renal and thrombotic complications
associated with severe COVID-19 disease, we suggest that BSG expression in the pulmonary
and systemic vasculature maybe an important driver which explains the heightened risk of
severe disease and death observed in those >40 years of age. These observations add to the
growing evidence and provide additional mechanistic insight supporting the targeting the
BSG: PPIA/PPIB axis in severe COVID-19 disease.

BSG is an attractive lead to have emerged from this work. BSG is upregulated in a range of
diseases including those co-morbidities/morbidities associated with increased risk of severe
COVID-19 disease and poorer outcomes including thrombosis53, pulmonary hypertension54,
renal disease55, obesity11 and diabetes56. Moreover BSG, as both a receptor for SARS-Cov-2
and as an inducer of extracellular matrix metalloproteinases, may be relevant when
considering the potential role of the vasculature and, specifically endothelial dysfunction, in
propagating and driving pulmonary fibrosis57,58 – one of the most feared long term
complications of COVID-1959.
Clearly, a full understanding of BSG interactions with SARS-CoV-2 will provide valuable
mechanistic insight and could identify new therapeutic targets and/or provide additional
insight for experimental drugs currently in trials for the prevention and treatment of severe
COVID-19 disease. For example, cyclosporin, an immunosuppressive drug used in the
prevention of organ rejection after transplant, has been suggested as a therapy for cytokine
storm associated with severe COVID-19 disease. To this end clinical trials to assess cyclosporin
drugs in COVID-19 have been initiated42,43. Cyclosporin also binds PPIA and therefore may
additionally inhibit viral binding to BSG. Our findings that BSG expression is increased with
age may provide additional rational for the use of drugs that interfere with cyclophilin
binding. In light of our findings and the overwhelming clinical information indicating vascular
inflammation in severe COVID-19 disease, the relative role of SARS-CoV-2 receptors and
processing proteins in endothelial cells should be investigated. Our data indicates that blood
outgrowth endothelial cells will be a useful tool in future work exploring mechanisms of viral
infection and inflammation in COVID-19. In addition, since blood outgrowth endothelial cells
can be obtained from blood samples of living donors, functional assays using these cells from
protected and at-risk populations may provide a means of identifying personalised therapies
and those at risk of severe disease.
Since BSG is utilised by other pathogens our findings have implication beyond the current
pandemic. Finally, because BSG is implicated in a range of cardiovascular diseases and fibrosis
our observations may have relevance to our understanding of the diseases associated with
aging.

Limitations and future studies:
The details of the cellular events involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection in different cell types has
not yet been fully established which means that the weighted relevance of genes that we
have investigated in COVID-19 remains to be elucidated. However, each of the genes that we
studied are established in various aspects of human physiology and pathology and so our
analysis has relevance to the understanding of aging in a setting wider than infection. We
used publicly available data sets which, while were analysed in a systematic and unbiased
manner, require replication and validation in a prospective follow up clinical and mechanistic
studies. Furthermore, gene expression data invariably requires biological validation in
functional assays.

Figure 1: Expression of SARS-CoV-2 entrance/processing genes in different cardiovascular
and non-cardiovascular tissues
Standardised expression levels for the genes ACE(A), BSG (B), ACE2 (C), ADAM17 (D), FURIN
(E), TMPRSS2 (F), PPIA (G), PPIB (H), CTSB (I) and CTSL (J) were obtained from GTEx from
cardiovascular tissues (aorta, coronary artery, atrial appendage, left ventricle, kidney cortex,
and whole blood; red columns) and other tissues (lung, blue columns; spleen, grey columns
and colon, green columns). Data for each tissue was corrected for batch effects COMBAT-seq
and expressed as mean +/- S.E.M. Tissues were ranked in order of expression for each gene.
A heat map showing expression of ACE2 and BSG pathways and viral processing proteases in
each tissue was generated (K). Data were coloured by gene, whereby black is the lowest
expressing tissue and red is highest expressing tissue.
Figure 2: Expression of SARS-CoV-2 entrance/processing genes in blood outgrowth
endothelial cells, PBMCs and epithelial cells (nasal and bronchial)
Standardised expression levels for the genes ACE(A), BSG (B), ACE2 (C), ADAM17 (D), FURIN
(E), TMPRSS2 (F), PPIA (G), PPIB (H), CTSB (I) and CTSL (J) were obtained from online databases
from human blood outgrowth endothelial cells (Endothelial cells, red columns), peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs, grey columns) and epithelial cells (nasal and bronchial, blue
columns). The data was aligned and analysed using PartekFlow® and corrected for batch
effects using COMBAT-seq and expressed as mean +/- S.E.M. Cells were ranked in order of
expression each gene. A heat map showing expression of ACE2 and BSG pathways and viral
processing proteases in each cell type was generated (K). Data were coloured by gene,
whereby black is the lowest expressing cell type and red is highest expressing cell type.
Figure 3: Heat map representing expression of SARS-CoV-2 entrance/processing genes
significantly altered by age
Heatmaps were generated for the expression of ACE, ACE2, BSG, ADAM17, CTSB, CTSL, FURIN,
PPIA, PPIB and TMPRSS2 in cells (A) and organs (B). Data were analysed based on two adult
age groups; under or over 40 years. Data were analysed using an unpaired Mann-Whitney ttest or unpaired t-test depending on normality distributions. Significant data (p<0.05) are
shown as either increased (red) or decreased (green) expression; black corresponds to no
significant change.
