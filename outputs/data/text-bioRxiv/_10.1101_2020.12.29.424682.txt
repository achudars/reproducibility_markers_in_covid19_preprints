Abstract

22

The influence of the peptide QAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQ on the kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2

23

spike protein S1 binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) was studied to model the

24

interaction of the virus with its host cell. This peptide corresponds to the sequence 24-42 of the ACE2

25

α1 domain, which is the binding site for the S1 protein. The on-rate and off-rate of S1-ACE2 complex

26

formation were measured in the presence of various peptide concentrations using Bio-Layer

27

Interferometry (BLI). The formation of the S1-ACE2 complex was inhibited when the S1 protein was

28

preincubated with the peptide, however, no significant inhibitory effect was observed in the absence of

29

preincubation. Dissociation kinetics revealed that the peptide remained bound to the S1-ACE2 complex

30

and stabilized this complex. Computational mapping of the S1 protein surface for peptide binding

31

revealed two additional sites, located at some distance from the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1.

32

These additional binding sites affect the interaction between the peptide, the S1 protein, and ACE2.

Introduction

35

Binding of SARS-CoV-2 particles to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells leads to

36

the fusion of the virus and host cell membranes and initiates the entrance of the viral RNA into the cells

37

[1-2]. It has been suggested that blocking this binding process will inhibit the virus entry process and

38

thus may have a therapeutic antiviral effect [3]. The most straightforward way of designing inhibitors is

39

to use peptides to mimic the interaction interface between the spike protein and the ACE2 molecule in

40

complex [4-6]. The spike protein is composed of S1and S2 domains, and it is S1 that contains the

41

receptor-binding domain (RBD) that binds to ACE2 [7-8]. As the molecular structure of the S1-

42

ACE2 complex is known [7-9], and the atomic coordinates and experimental data (code 6LZG)

43

have been deposited in the PDB database (www.wwPDB.org), inhibitory peptides can be designed

44

based on the structure of the complex. However, as ACE2 is a physiologically important enzyme, its

45

inhibition by antiviral prophylaxis with peptides derived from the spike protein is not a promising

46

approach. Therefore, we designed peptides that are derived from the ACE2 structure and interact with

47

the RBD of the spike protein S1 [5, 6].

48

Initially, the ACE2 binding site on the S1 protein was mapped computationally [5]. This analysis

49

revealed that the peptide STIEEQAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQSSL, derived from the α1 domain of the

50

N-terminal part of ACE2, containing amino acids 19-45, can be truncated from both ends without

51

significant loss of binding. Therefore, the shorter peptide QAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQ (amino acids

52

24 - 42), which still interacts effectively with the S1 protein (docking energy Edock = -11.7

53

kcal/mol [5]), was selected for experiments in this study. The molecular mass of this peptide is too low

54

for a direct binding assay using Bio-Layer Interferometry technology (BLI) [10], and it is unclear how

55

chemical modification or loading with a cargo molecule or linker group would influence the binding

56

properties of the peptide. Therefore, we loaded ACE2 onto the biosensors and studied the influence of

57

the peptide on the kinetics of the S1-ACE2 interaction.

66

coupling reagents, and N, N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) was used as the activator base.

67

Cleavage of the product was performed with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 2.5% triisopropylsilane

68

(TIPS), and 2.5% water for three hours at room temperature.

69

The peptide was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a C4

70

column (Phenomenex Jupiter C4, 5 μm, 300 Å, 250 × 10 mm, Agilent) using an

71

acetonitrile/water gradient containing 0.1% TFA. The purity of the peptide was validated at 98%

72

using a Waters Acquity Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) with an

73

acetonitrile/water gradient (Supplement Fig S1). The accurate molecular weight of the peptide

74

was determined to be 2342 Da using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight

75

(MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (Brucker Microflex LT/ SH, USA), with α-cyano-4-

76

hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix (Supplement Fig S2). The calculated molecular weight of

77

the peptide was 2342.15 Da.

89

In one series of experiments, the peptide was preincubated with S1 for 15 min at 25°C before

90

the binding assay. Complex dissociation was initiated by immersing the biosensors into fresh

91

assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0 with 150 mM NaCl), without S1 protein and peptide.

Data were analyzed using ForteBio Data Analysis software (version 11.1.1.39) [11]. Results are

presented in the Supplement Table S1 and Table S2.

Computational peptide docking

96

The peptide docking study was performed as described previously [5,6]. Briefly, the

97

input file for modeling the S1-ACE2 complex was built from X-ray analysis data [7,9] deposited

98

in the PDB database (www.wwPDB.org) with the code 6LZG. GROMACS package (version

99

4.6.1) was used for molecular dynamics simulations [12] and AutoDock Vina (version 1.1.2) was

100

used for ligand docking [13]. The best scores were selected for peptide positioning. Protein

101

protonation at pH 7 was processed using the GROMACS pdb2gmx tool, and the geometric,

102

charge, and van der Waals constrained parameters were assigned using the GROMOS 53a6 force

103

field parameter set [14]. The protein structure, neutralized by adding Na+ and Cl− ions, was

104

solvated in a 5 nm cubic box, filled with SPC water as solvent [15]. The system was allowed to

105

reach equilibrium at constant pressure (1 atm) [16] and temperature (300 K), controlled by the

106

modified Berendsen thermostat algorithm [17]. Equilibrated simulations were performed on the

107

systems for ten nanoseconds. After MD relaxation, the protein structure was extracted from the

108

system and used for docking procedures. The docking compatible structure formats of the protein

109

were prepared by AutoDockTools (version 1.5.6) [18]. The fitting box with 0.3 Å of grid spacing

110

was defined once and used for all docking calculations. The fitting area covered the whole

111

protein space and the docking poses were obtained and listed following the docking energy

Results and discussion

116

Kinetic measurements of the S1-ACE2 binding interaction

117

The influence of the peptide QAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQ on the binding of the SARS-CoV-2

118

spike S1 protein with ACE2 was investigated by loading ACE2 onto biosensors, then dipping

119

into a buffer containing S1 protein, or S1 protein and peptide. This experimental setup allowed

120

characterization of the complex formation and dissociation reactions, described by the ascending

121

and descending parts of the graphs, respectively, exemplified in Fig 1. Taking the ascending part

122

of the plot, the complex formation reaction is characterized by the first-order rate constant

123

kon (s-1) and the second-order rate constant kass (M-1s-1). In the latter case, the concentration of the

124

S1 protein in the assay buffer is taken into consideration [10]. The descending part of the plot

125

allows calculation of the complex dissociation rate constant, denoted here as koff (s-1). The

126

equilibrium constant, KD, for the complex dissociation can be calculated as the ratio of the koff

127

and kass values [10, 11]. In this study, the KD values for the S1-ACE2 complex, calculated from two

128

parallel experiments in the absence of the peptide, were (1.28 ± 0.01)10-8 M and (3.05 ± 0.01)10-8 M,

129

respectively. These values agree with the KD = 2.9 x 10-8 M, published by Reaction Biology [20], and

130

confirm the reliability of the assay procedure.

Peptide influence on the kinetics of the S1-ACE2 interaction

141

Fig 1 shows that the time course of interaction of the spike protein S1 with ACE2 (red line) is affected

142

by the addition of 5 μM peptide (green line). For a more detailed analysis of the effect of the peptide on

143

the S1-ACE2 interaction, two series of kinetic experiments were performed, in which varying amounts

144

of the peptide were added to the kinetic assay. One series of experiments simultaneously added the S1

145

protein and the peptide to the sensor-immobilized ACE2 to initiate the complex formation. In the second

146

series of experiments, preincubation of the S1 protein with the peptide was performed for 15 minutes

147

before initiation of the complex formation. From these data, the kon values were calculated, and the

148

results of this analysis are summarized in Fig 2.

157

Fig 2 shows that the peptide QAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQ inhibited the rate of S1-ACE2

158

complex formation, decreasing the rate constant almost two-fold when the spike S1 protein had been

159

preincubated with the peptide. In contrast, no inhibitory effect was observed when the spike S1 protein

160

and peptide were added simultaneously to the assay buffer. These results suggest that the peptide

161

interaction with the spike S1 protein is a slow process, and preincubation is necessary to load the spike

162

S1 protein with the peptide.

163

Secondly, Fig. 2 shows that the rate constant (kon) decreases in the presence of the peptide in a

164

dose-dependent manner, and the half-maximal inhibitory effect was reached at 0.7±0.4 μM. Certainly,

165

this value has some physical meaning if the peptide-spike S1 protein interaction can be described as an

166

equilibrium process.

167

Finally, the formation of the S1-ACE2 complex was not completely inhibited by the peptide,

168

since the kon values leveled off, even when an excess of the peptide was added. This phenomenon cannot

169

be unambiguously explained with the existing data. However, it appears likely that the incomplete

170

inhibition could be connected to the slow rate of the peptide interaction with its binding site on the S1

171

protein.

172
173

Dissociation kinetics of the S1-ACE2 complex

174

Dissociation of the ACE2 bound S1 protein was initiated by transferring the biosensor into fresh assay

175

buffer that did not contain peptide or S1 protein. Therefore, if a binary complex is formed between the

176

ACE2 and S1 proteins, similar koff values, calculated from the descending part of the kinetic curves (see

177

Fig 1), should describe the dissociation process in experiments, performed at different peptide

178

concentration. However, this was not true of this study, as illustrated in Fig 3.

180

Fig 3.

181

Dissociation of the S1-ACE2 complex, captured by the biosensor in the binding assay. The S1-

182

ACE2 protein complex was formed in the presence of different peptide concentrations in experiments

183

where the S1 protein had been preincubated with the peptide for 15 minutes (series A, squares), or the

184

S1 protein had not been preincubated with the peptide (series B, circles). To initiate the dissociation

185

process, the biosensor was transferred into fresh buffer that did not contain peptide and S1 protein.

186
187

It is important to emphasize that dissociation of the S1-ACE2 protein complex was initiated by

188

transfer of the biosensor into buffer that did not contain peptide as well as S1. However, it can be seen in

189

Fig 3 that the koff value depends on the peptide concentration, which was used in the complex formation

190

reaction, demonstrating “memory” relating to the peptide presence in the latter process. These results

191

raise the following questions about the S1-ACE2 complex formation and its structure.

192

First, the occurrence of such “memory” indicates that different complexes could be formed in

193

the presence of different peptide concentrations, or more likely, the peptide remains in some fraction of this

194

complex, affecting its stability when compared with the binary complex.

195

Second, half of the peptide’s effect on koff is observed at a peptide concentration of 0.6±0.4 μM,

196

which is in agreement with the effect observed with kon (Fig 2). This may indicate that both effects are

197

caused by the same phenomenon, likely by the formation of the S1-peptide complex. From a chemistry

198

point of view, this is possible if there are several binding sites for this peptide on the S1 protein, as one

199

site must be occupied by the α1 domain of ACE2 in the process of complex formation.

200

Third, Fig 3 illustrates that preincubation of the peptide with the S1 protein before complex

201

formation with ACE2 destabilized the S1-ACE2 complex since all koff values for series B were higher

202

than the equivalent values in series A. Importantly, this effect did not depend on the peptide presence, as
9

203

observed when comparing the data points at zero peptide concentration. However, no systematic

204

differences were observed in the binding experiments, performed with both preincubated and non-

205

preincubated S1 protein samples at zero peptide concentration (Fig 2). Thus, the different stabilities of

206

the S1-ACE2 complexes, with or without preincubation of the peptide with S1 protein, seem to be

207

specific for the off-rate reaction, however, the reasons for this phenomenon remain unclear.

208

Last, although the rate constants kon, kass, and koff depend on peptide concentration (Figs 2

209

and 3), there is practically no influence of the peptide on the Kd value, calculated as the ratio of

210

the rate constants koff / kass. Thus, these data demonstrate that even effective peptide interaction

211

with the S1 protein may not shift the equilibrium of the S1 protein binding to ACE2. However,

212

the peptide has a significant effect on S1-ACE2 complex formation and dissociation kinetics.

213

This is an important conclusion to be considered in antiviral therapeutics design, as the simple

214

inhibition mechanism of the virus-receptor binding process by peptides suggested in many

215

papers seems to be oversimplified.

216
217

Alternative peptide binding sites on the S1 protein

218

The hypothesis that additional (allosteric) binding sites exist on the S1-ACE2 complex,

219

which may bind additional peptide molecules that cause the “memory” effect in the off-rate

220

experiments, was investigated computationally by mapping the putative docking landscape

221

outside the known ACE2 binding site on the S1 protein. These calculations revealed that there

222

are allosteric binding possibilities for the peptide QAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQ (Fig 4).

spike protein S1 and ACE2. The S1 protein is shown in blue and the ACE2 molecule is shown

227

in green. Two allosterically bound peptide QAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQ molecules are shown in

228

red. The sequence (amino acids 24-42) of the α1 domain of ACE2 which interacts with the S1

229

protein is shown in violet.

230
231

The docking energies of peptide QAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQ at the two allosteric

232

sites were Edock=-10.7 kcal/mol (upper location) and Edock=-10.5 kcal/mol (lower location), while

233

the docking energy of the same peptide in the recognized RBD of S1 was -11.6 kcal/mol (violet).

234

As these additional sites do not overlap with the RBD, peptide binding to these sites does not

235

necessarily compete with S1 binding to ACE2, however, there may be an allosteric effect.

236

Importantly, the allosteric sites are also available in the free S1 protein, which explains the

237

experimental observations and reasons for the “memory” effect in the off-rate kinetics (where the

238

influence of the peptide used in on-rate experiments is revealed in a dose-dependent manner).

239

Interestingly, sequential binding of several ACE2 molecules with the spike protein has

240

been discussed in an extensive cryoEM study, where a 1:3 stoichiometry of the spike protein-

241

ACE2 complex was observed [21]. However, if the formation of these multimeric complexes

242

assumes significant conformational changes of participating proteins, binding of additional

243

peptide fragments to the S1 protein appears to be achieved without significant structural changes.

244

Therefore, the physiological meaning for the additional binding sites should be analyzed

245

separately. Furthermore, the presence of several binding sites for the ACE2 α1 domain peptide

246

may open new perspectives for the development of therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2

247

infection.

Conclusions

250

The binding kinetics of the spike protein S1 to the SARS-CoV-2 virus receptor ACE2 is

251

affected by the presence of the peptide QAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQ, which corresponds to the

252

sequence 24-42 of the α1 domain of the ACE2 receptor protein. However, as the off-rate of the

253

complex also depends on the concentration of this peptide, which is added to the reaction

254

mixture during the complex formation process, the inhibitory effect of the peptide cannot be

255

clearly observed in the overall binding equilibrium, characterized by the dissociation constant

256

Kd. The results suggest that the S1 protein has more than one binding site for the ACE2 α1

257

domain peptide. Our molecular docking calculations confirmed this theory, revealing two other

258

sites, located remotely from the main RBD of the S1 protein. These findings may be important

259

for the development of new peptide-based antiviral therapeutics.
