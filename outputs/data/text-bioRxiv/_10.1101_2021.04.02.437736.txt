Abstract

15

Viral exoribonucleases are uncommon in the world of RNA viruses. To date, this activity has been identified

16

only in the Arenaviridae and the Coronaviridae families. These exoribonucleases play important but

17

different roles in both families: for mammarenaviruses the exoribonuclease is involved in the suppression of

18

the host immune response whereas for coronaviruses, exoribonuclease is both involved in a proofreading

19

mechanism ensuring the genetic stability of viral genomes and participating to evasion of the host innate

20

immunity. Because of their key roles, they constitute attractive targets for drug development. Here we

21

present a high-throughput assay using fluorescence polarization to assess the viral exoribonuclease activity

22

and its inhibition. We validate the assay using three different viral enzymes from SARS-CoV-2, lymphocytic

23

choriomeningitis and Machupo viruses. The method is sensitive, robust, amenable to miniaturization (384

24

well plates) and allowed us to validate the proof-of-concept of the assay by screening a small focused

25

compounds library (23 metal chelators). We also determined the IC50 of one inhibitor common to the three

26

viruses.

1. Introduction

43
44

RNA viruses code for a polyprotein, forming the replication/transcription complex (RTC) that orcherstrates

45

viral replication. In this complex process, specific viral enzymatic activities are only found in some RNA

46

viruses families. This is the case for the 3'-5'-exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity identified in Arenaviridae and

47

Coronaviridae viral families, although these viruses display very different genome organization and

48

replication/transcription strategies. Indeed, arenaviruses have an ambisense bi-segmented negative single-

49

stranded RNA genome whereas the coronavirus genome is composed of a positive single-stranded RNA

50

(Ferron et al., 2017; Knipe and Howley, 2013, Ogando et al., 2019). The ExoN activity identified in these

51

two viral families are involved in different processes (Hastie et al., 2011; Snijder et al., 2003). Indeed, the

52

ExoN carried by arenavirus nucleoprotein (NP) is likely involved in the suppression of the host innate

53

immune response (Martínez-Sobrido et al., 2009, 2007, 2006) while the ExoN carried by the nsp14 protein

54

of coronaviruses allows optimization of the replication fidelity of the viral genome (Bouvet et al., 2012;

55

Ferron et al., 2018) as well as evasion of the host innate immunity (Becares et al., 2016; Lei et al., 2020).

56

The arenavirus and coronavirus ExoN belong to the same DEDD superfamily (DED/EDh subfamily), are

57

structurally similar (Zuo and Deutscher, 2001) and are characterized by the presence of four conserved acidic

58

residues (Asp and Glu) (Bouvet et al., 2012; Yekwa et al., 2019). The catalytic residues are essential for the

59

binding of two metal cations involved in the RNA hydrolysis mechanism (Steitz and Steitz, 1993), always

60

proceeding from the 3'- to the 5'-direction.

61

Because of its biological significance to the viral life cycle and role in infectious processes, arenavirus and

62

coronavirus ExoN is an attractive target for drug development (Papageorgiou et al., 2020; Subissi et al.,

63

2014). Currently, there are almost no FDA-approved antivirals against these viruses, despite the loss of

64

human lives during the short-lived SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 and the continuing MERS epidemic or

65

regular outbreaks of LASSA virus in West Africa causing several thousand case fatalities. Today, the

66

situation is different, the world is paralyzed by a global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and this event revealed the

67

urgency to act to develop potent antivirals, in support of a vaccine approach.

68

While millions of molecules are available in countless compounds libaries, drug development efforts are

69

generally restricted by the limitations of validated therapeutic targets or available potent high-throughput

70

screening assays. For mammarenavirus and coronavirus ExoN assay making use of radiolabeled substrate are

71

available but barely adapted to HT screening (Bouvet et al., 2012; Ferron et al., 2018; Yekwa et al., 2019,

72

2017; Baddock et al., 2020; Saramago et al., 2021)).

73

Here we present a method using fluorescence polarization (FP) to assess the ExoN activity and its inhibition.

74

The method relies on the hydrolysis of a fluorescent RNA substrate into smaller fragments which translates

75

in a modification of the FP signal which is measured and recorded. The FP signal is altered proportionally to

76

the size of the fluorescent RNA probe. We validate the method on three different viral enzymes of interest

77

from SARS-CoV-2, Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis and Machupo viruses. The method is sensitive, robust,

78

amenable to miniaturization (384 well plates) and allowed us to screen a focused library of 23 metal

79

chelators over the three targeted viral ExoN, validating the proof-of-concept of the assay. We also

80

determined the IC50 of one inhibitor common to the three viruses.

Raltegravir (1) and Baloxavir (5) were purchased from Carbosynth. Aurintricarboxyclic acid (11) was

86

purchased from Acros Organics. Excepting for the compounds 8, 13, 14, 15 and 24, the other compounds

87

have been described previously (Saez-Ayala et al., 2019, 2018). All compounds were resuspended in 100 %

88

DMSO at 20 mM and stored at - 20 ◦C. The 22-mer RNA 5’-UGACGGCCCGGAAAACCGGGCC-3'

89

containing FAM dye at the 5'-end (5'-FAM-RNA) was purchased from Microsynth AG (Switzerland).

2.2 Protein expression and purification.

92

The LCMV, MACV, ExoN plasmids used for this study were described in (Yekwa et al., 2019). The protein

93

production method is detailed in the supplementary data file (see also figure S1 for elution profiles). For the

94

expression of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 and nsp14, the synthetic genes were purchased from Twist (USA) and

95

were cloned with a hexahistidine tag in the N-terminus of the protein. E. coli DE3 cells were transformed

96

with the corresponding expression vectors. Bacteria were grown in TB medium with the corresponding

97

antibiotic and protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 500 µM for

98

nsp10 and 50 µM for nsp14 when the OD600nm of the culture reached a value of 0.5. The induction was

99

performed during 16 h at 17°C and 200 rpm. Bacterial cell pellets were frozen and resuspended in lysis

100

buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and 300 mM NaCl) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM imidazole, 10

101

µg/ml DNase I, 0.25 mg/ml of lysozyme and 0.5% Triton X-100. After sonication and clarification, proteins

102

were purified by two steps of chromatography. The first step consisted of an IMAC (Ni Resin). The lysate

103

was passed through the column and washed with lysis buffer supplemented with 20 mM imidazole. The

104

protein was eluted with lysis buffer supplemented with 250 mM imidazole. Protein fractions were then

105

loaded on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare), and eluted with 10 mM

106

HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 5% glycerol. The fraction containing the pure protein, as

107

examined by SDS-PAGE and coomasie staining, were pooled and concentrated in the gel filtration buffer,

108

aliquoted in small volumes, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.

114

RNA concentration (50, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 nM), a range of concentration of ExoN (SARS-CoV-2,

115

LCMV or MACV) was tested from a ratio of 5-fold less enzyme up to 10-fold more enzyme (10 nM to 10

116

uM) than 5'-FAM-RNA. For SARS-CoV-2 ExoN, the molar ratio of nsp14:nsp10 complex in the reactions

117

was always kept at 1:4, as optimized previously (Bouvet et al., 2012). The reaction started by the addition of

118

5'-FAM-RNA and the fluorescence polarization (FP) was read in the Pherastar FSX (BMG Labtech) using

119

the 480 nm excitation and 520 nm emission filter, during 30 minutes at 25°C, every 30 seconds. The gain

120

was set up using the negative control which contained the fluorescent RNA in the reaction buffer with metal

121

ion and in the presence of heat-denatured nuclease. Other negative controls tested used consisted in the

122

replacement of MnCl2 by CaCl2 or, depletion of the metal ion in the reaction mix and depletion of the

123

enzyme. After 30 minutes, the reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of loading buffer

124

(8M urea containing 10 mM EDTA) and the digestion products were then loaded in 7 M urea containing

125

20% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio 19:1) buffered with TBE and visualized

126

using a Fluorescent Image Analyzer Typhoon (GE Healthcare).

127
128

2.3.2 Optimisation of temperature, metal ion nature and concentration requirement

129

To find the optimal temperature, metal ion nature and reagent concentration, reactions were performed in the

130

buffer mentioned above. The 5'-FAM-RNA concentration was kept at 100 nM and ExoN concentration

131

ranged from 100 nM to 1600 nM. The activity was tested in the presence of MnCl2 or MgCl2 at three

132

different concentrations 1, 2 or 5 mM. The FP signal was recorded as mentioned previously either at 25°C or

133

at 37°C. After finishing the recording of the FP signal, an aliquot of the sample was examined in urea PAGE

134

as mentioned above.

135
136

2.3.3 Time course of ExoN assay

137

Reactions of 20 µl total volume were performed in the buffer mentioned above, with 2 mM MnCl2 for

138

SARS-CoV-2 ExoN and 5 mM for LCMV or MACV ExoN. The 5'-FAM-RNA concentration was fixed at

139

100 nM. The SARS-CoV-2 nsp14/nsp10 ExoN complex concentration was ranged from 200 nM to 1 µM

140

and pre-incubation at RT during 5 minutes was performed to allow the complex formation. The LCMV and

141

MACV ExoN concentration was ranged from 100 nM to 1600 nM. The reaction started by the addition of 5'-

142

FAM-RNA and The FP signal was recorded as mentioned previously. After finishing the recording of the FP

2.4.1 HTS assay based on fluorescent polarization assay

149

The screening at 5 µM and 20 µM inhibitor concentration was performed in 384-wells with flat bottom Nunc

150

plates, in 20 µL total volume reaction. Reactions were performed in a buffer containing 40 mM Tris (pH 8),

151

5 mM DTT, with 2 mM MnCl2 for SARS-CoV-2 and 5 mM MnCl2 for LCMV or MACV ExoN. The 5'-

152

FAM-RNA concentration was fixed at 100 nM. The ExoN concentration was fixed at 400 nM. Compounds

153

(1-23) were added to the reaction with final concentration of 5 µM and 20 µM in 5% DMSO. Reactions were

154

initiated by addition of the 5'-FAM-RNA using a multichannel pipette. 48 positive controls (the reaction mix

155

with 5% DMSO, with ExoN and without compound) have been deposited randomly in the 384-well plate. 48

156

negative controls (the reaction mixture with 5% DMSO, without or with ExoN that has been heat denatured,

157

and without compound), have been deposited randomly in the 384-well plate. The reaction started by the

158

addition of 5'-FAM-RNA and the FP signal was recorded as mentioned previously. To calculate the

159

percentage of inhibition, a time correction was applied for the delayed initiation of the reaction due to the use

160

of a multichannel pipette. The percentage of inhibition at a given time was calculated as follows :

where FP correspond to the fluorescent polarization signal of a compound.

The time selected for doing this calculation was the time when the signal of the positive control reached the

Reactions were performed in a buffer containing 40 mM Tris (pH 8), 5 mM DTT, with 2 mM MnCl2 for

SARS-CoV-2 ExoN and 5 mM for LCMV or MACV ExoN. The 5'-FAM-RNA concentration was fixed at

ExoN nsp14/nsp10 complex. The reaction started by the addition of 5'-FAM-RNA and the FP signal was

recorded as mentioned previously. The percentage of inhibition was calculated as indicated in the previous

section. The curves of percentage of inhibition respect to the inhibitor concentration in a logarithmic scale

were fitted in Graphpad Prism software using a four parameters equation. The assays were done in triplicate.

3. Results and discussion

178
179

Fluorescence polarization (FP) is a reliable and sensitive tool for monitoring enzymatic reaction

180

progress, by determining the difference of polarization signals during reaction (Zhang et al., 2012). FP -

181

based assays in HTS studies have been used in drug discovery (Lea and Simeonov, 2011; Uri and Nonga,

182

2020, Baughman et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2014)). The FP signal recorded is proportional to the molecular

183

weight (MW) of a fluorescent molecule (Kwok, 2002; Latif et al., 2001). We decided to apply this method to

184

viral ExoN activity, by monitoring the size of a fluorescent labeled RNA probe which is altered in the course

185

of the nuclease activity, reflecting the enzymatic activity (Liu et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2012). Because

186

several factors can change the FP- monitoring success, the assay was first optimized.

187
188

3.1 Determination of optimized experimental conditions of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14/nsp10 complex, LCMV

189

and MACV ExoN activity based on FP assay

190
191

To set-up a HTS assay for the SARS-CoV-2, LCMV and MACV ExoN activity, we explored 5'-FAM-RNA

192

substrate(s) and enzyme(s) concentration, metal ion co-factors, temperature and reaction duration. RNA

193

substrate and optimal conditions for arenavirus and coronavirus ExoN activity are already described (Bouvet

194

et al., 2012; Saramago et al., 2021; Yekwa et al., 2019, 2017). A 22mer RNA that forms stable hairpin in its

195

3’ end has been reported to be a valuable substrate for both arenavirus and coronavirus ExoN. Moreover, for

196

SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 ExoN, nsp10 was added in the reaction (ratio 1:4 of nsp14:nsp10) as nsp10 was

197

previously demonstrated to stimulate > 35-fold the nsp14 ExoN activity (Bouvet et al., 2012; Saramago et

198

al., 2021).

199

We first determined the smallest 5'-FAM-RNA concentration that provides sufficient FP signal,

200

concomitantly with the set-up of the ratio of ExoN and 5'-FAM-RNA to obtain a reproducible and stable FP

201

signal. For each 5'-FAM-RNA concentration tested (50 to 1000 nM), single turn over (STO) conditions

202

(excess of enzyme respect to substrate) and also multiple turn over (MTO) conditions (excess of substrate

203

respect to enzyme) were tested. Because the RNA substrate is degraded during the ExoN activity, FP value is

204

altered proportionally. A significant change in the FP signal due to the hydrolysis of the 5'-FAM-RNA was

205

observed only under STO conditions. 100 nM concentration of 5'-FAM-RNA was selected because it was the

206

smallest concentration of substrate providing a reproducible and stable FP signal.

207

We optimized the positive and negative controls of ExoN activity. Several combinations were tested

208

(Supplementary figure S2): 5'-FAM-RNA in reaction buffer with metal ions, 5'-FAM-RNA in reaction buffer

209

with ExoN and without metal ions, 5'-FAM-RNA in reaction buffer with ions and denaturated ExoN and 5'-

210

FAM-RNA in reaction buffer with CaCl2 instead of MnCl2. For all the negative controls tested, there was no

211

variation between the initial and final FP values after 30 min incubation, indicating the absence of

212

degradation of the fluorescent probe. However, we observe that the initial FP values are lower without metal

213

ions in the reaction buffer (Supplementary figure S2), or in the presence of EDTA 10 mM (data not shown).

214

This results is in agreement with the study of Liu et al (Liu et al., 2014), who carried out the experiments to

215

investigate the influence of metal ions in FP assays, and reported that cations concentration can affect the FP

216

signal by altering the mobility of the fluorophore through stabilizing the RNA secondary structure. Thus, for

217

the rest of the study, the negative controls were prepared by mixing 5'-FAM-RNA in reaction buffer with

218

ions and without ExoN.

219

Regarding the nature of the metal ion, MnCl2 and MgCl2 were tested. An increased activity is observed in the

220

presence of MnCl2 for both arenaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 ExoN (data not shown). The concentration of

221

MnCl2 that shows the highest reduction in FP signal is 5 mM for arenaviruses as previously reported (Yekwa

222

et al., 2019, 2017) and 2 mM for SARS-CoV-2 as recently reported (Baddock et al., 2020; Saramago et al.,

223

2021). Finally the temperature selected to perform the assay is 25°C since the incubation at 37°C leads to a

224

significative evaporation of the sample that reduces the stability and reproducibility of the FP signal.

226

3.2 Assessing the SARS-CoV-2, LCMV and MACV ExoN activity by FP

227
228

While the 5'-FAM-RNA substrate was fixed at 100 nM, which was the lowest concentration fairly detected

229

by the sensitivity of the method, different concentrations of ExoN were tested (100 nM to 1600 nM). The FP

230

signal change was measured during 30 min. The FP curves and digestion products examined in urea PAGE

231

after FP reading, are gathered in figure 1.

232

The negative controls (figure 1, brown curves, in panels A, B and C) present flattened curves, as expected.

233

Remarkably, early in the reaction a small increase in the initial FP value is observed, which could correspond

234

to the time required for the formation of the catalytic complex between the ExoN, the catalytic cations and

235

the 5'-FAM-RNA substrate. This is more visible for the SARS-CoV-2 ExoN, which requires the interaction

236

of nsp14 and nsp10 forming the active complex. This increase of fluorescence occurs for all FP curves but is

237

visible mainly on the FP curves corresponding to the lowest ExoN concentrations when the formation of the

238

pre-hydrolytic complex presumably takes the longest time.

239

For all tested ExoN, excepting for the lowest used concentration, we observe a reduction of the FP signal

240

with time. The decrease of the FP value is correlated with the hydrolysis of the 5'-FAM-RNA substrate by

241

the ExoN, as confirmed on the urea PAGE images (figure 1, panels D, E and F). The difference between

242

initial and final FP value after 30 min is proportional to the number of nucleotides removed from the 5'-

243

FAM-RNA.

244

By increasing the ExoN concentration, we observe an increase in the FP curves slope but the FP signals

245

reach a plateau which might be related to the inability to remove any extra nucleotide after a certain point.

246

The method efficiency was validated by the difference of FP values between the negative control (figure 1,

247

brown curves, in panels A, B and C) and the FP value obtained at one concentration after 30 min reaction.

248

This difference was selected as significant enough, with ΔFP +/- 30 units of mP.

249

To validate this method and use it as screening assay, we decided to use a molar ratio 1:4 between the 5'-

250

FAM-RNA substrate (100 nM) and ExoN (400 nM). With the optimized duration, temperature and

251

experimental conditions, this ratio gives the more stable and reproducible FP signals, correlated with specific

252

5'-FAM-RNA fragments.

3.3 Screening of a focused library against the SARS-CoV-2, LCMV and MACV ExoN using FP

255

Because ExoN activity is metal dependent, we tested a focused library of 23 metal chelators that we have

256

developed previously (Saez-Ayala et al., 2019, 2018), in order to demonstrate the robustness of our FP

257

method. Two screenings were performed using 5 μM and 20 μM of compounds in 5% DMSO in a single

258

assay. The robustness of the assay for HTS was calculated using 48 negative and 48 positive controls. The

259

lowest Z' value is 0.68 indicating that the assay is reliable (see supplementary data figure S3). The

260

percentages of inhibition at 5 μM and 20 μM for each ExoN, extracted from FP curves (see supplementary

261

data figure S4), are gathered in supplementary figure S5 and figure 2 (panels A, B and C), respectively. The

262

degree of digestion of the RNA substrate was also controlled by fragments separation on urea-PAGE at the

263

end of the reaction for compounds 4, 11, 13, 18 and 23 (figure 2, panel D).

264

We identified compound 11 which inhibits 100% of the different ExoN activity at 20 μM and 78%, 76% and

265

100% at 5 μM, respectively against LCMV, MACV and SARS-CoV-2 ExoN. Compound 11 which is

266

Aurintricarboxyclic Acid (ATA) was included as positive control as it has been previously described as

267

nuclease inhibitor (Huang et al., 2016), acting as non-specific metal chelator (Sharma et al., 2000). We also

268

identified inhibitors showing more specific inhibition profile. Compound 4 is active against SARS-CoV-2

269

with 61% inhibition at 20 μM (less than 10% inhibition of LCMV ExoN) while compound 23 is specific to

270

LCMV ExoN with 71% inhibition (less than 10% inhibition of MACV ExoN). Compounds 13 and 18 are

271

potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 ExoN with more 90% and weak inhibitors of LCMV and MACV ExoN

272

(less than 20% inhibition). The FP method allowed the identification of potent ExoN inhibitors as

273

compounds 4, 11, 13, 18 and 23, and the absence of RNA degradation was confirmed by urea PAGE analysis

274

(figure 2 - panel D) used as an orthogonal validation assay.

275
276

3.4 Assessing IC50 measurement of compound 11 by FP

277

Compound 11 displaying the highest inhibition, at both 5 and 20 μM, was used as model for IC50

278

determination. The FP curves, the digestion products examined in urea PAGE after FP reading and dose-

279

response curves obtained by extraction of FP data are gathered in figure 3. The IC50 values were determined

280

by hill plot curve fitting (see materials and methods section). The IC50 values for LCMV, MACV and SARS-

281

CoV-2 ExoN were 3.61 ± 0.20 µM, 3.46 ± 0.29 µM and 1.64 ± 0.17µM, respectively. Notably, these values

282

correlated perfectly with the 80% inhibition obtained by screening at 5 µM, confirming the robustness and

283

reproducibility of the assay. The FP signal correlates also with the degree of digestion observed by gel.

284
285
286

4. Conclusion

287

The use of fluorescence polarization assay for inhibitors identification was investigated and we prove that

288

this technique is reliable and sensitive to monitor nuclease activity.

289

Our work presents the development of a viral ExoN HTS assay in 384-well plates. Its most valuable feature

290

is that allows a reliable and rapid identification of ExoN inhibitors limiting the ExoN activity of viral

291

enzymes belonging to arenavirus (LCMV and MACV) and coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).

292

These results make fluorescence polarization assay an important tool in the screening of compounds libraries

293

to discover antivirals.
