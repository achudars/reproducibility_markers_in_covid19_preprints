Abstract

We previously reported that a single immunization with an adenovirus serotype 26
(Ad26) vector-based vaccine expressing an optimized SARS-CoV-2 spike (Ad26.COV2.S)
protected rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In this study, we evaluated the
immunogenicity and protective efficacy of reduced doses of Ad26.COV2.S. 30 rhesus macaques
were immunized once with 1x1011, 5x1010, 1.125x1010, or 2x109 vp Ad26.COV2.S or sham and
were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal and intratracheal routes. Vaccine doses as
low as 2x109 vp provided robust protection in bronchoalveolar lavage, whereas doses of
1.125x1010 vp were required for protection in nasal swabs. Activated memory B cells as well as
binding and neutralizing antibody titers following vaccination correlated with protective
efficacy. At suboptimal vaccine doses, viral breakthrough was observed but did not show
evidence of virologic, immunologic, histopathologic, or clinical enhancement of disease
compared with sham controls. These data demonstrate that a single immunization with a
relatively low dose of Ad26.COV2.S effectively protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in
rhesus macaques. Moreover, our findings show that a higher vaccine dose may be required for
protection in the upper respiratory tract compared with the lower respiratory tract.

Introduction

Immune correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be defined in humans.
We recently reported that purified IgG from convalescent rhesus macaques protected naïve
animals against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a dose-dependent fashion and that cellular immune
responses may also contribute to protection1. We previously demonstrated that an adenovirus
serotype 26 (Ad26) vector2 expressing a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spike3,4, termed Ad26.COV2.S,
effectively protected rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 infection and protected hamsters
against severe SARS-CoV-2 disease5,6. In these studies, vaccine-elicited binding and
neutralizing antibodies correlated with protection5,6. DNA vaccines, mRNA vaccines, ChAdOx1
vectors, and inactivated virus vaccines have also been reported to protect against SARS-CoV-2
challenge in macaques7-11.
In multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccine studies in nonhuman primates, protection in the upper
respiratory tract appeared less robust than protection in the lower respiratory tract6-8,11. These
data have raised the possibility that protection against asymptomatic infection may be more
difficult to achieve than protection against severe pneumonia in humans. However, the role of
vaccine dose in protection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts has not previously been
defined. Moreover, suboptimal vaccine doses can be utilized to assess the theoretical concern of
vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD), although VAERD has not been
reported to date in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine studies in animals or humans.
In this study, we assessed the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a titration of
Ad26.COV2.S dose levels to evaluate immune correlates of protection, to define the role of
reduced vaccine doses in protecting different anatomic respiratory compartments, and to assess

the possibility of VAERD. We observed that low doses of Ad26.COV2.S protected against
Ad26.COV2.S challenge in the lower respiratory tract but that higher vaccine dose levels were
required to protect in the upper respiratory tract. Suboptimal vaccine dose levels resulted in
reduced protective efficacy, but no evidence of VAERD was observed.

Results

Vaccine Immunogenicity with Reduced Ad26.COV2.S Dose Levels
We immunized 30 adult male and female rhesus macaques with a single dose of 1x1011,
5x1010, 1.125x1010, or 2x109 viral particles (vp) Ad26.COV2.S (N=5/group) or sham (N=10) at
week 0 (Fig. S1). We observed induction of RBD-specific binding antibodies by ELISA in
animals that received the 1x1011, 5x1010, and 1.125x1010 vp doses by week 2 and in animals that
received the 2x109 vp dose by week 4 (Fig. 1A). Neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses were
assessed using a pseudovirus neutralization assay11-13 and were observed in the majority of
animals in the three higher dose groups by week 2, with increasing titers through week 6 (Fig.
1B). NAb titers remained low in the 2x109 vp group at weeks 2 and 4 but became detectable in
all animals by week 6, suggesting slower kinetics and lower magnitude NAb responses (Fig.
1B).
IFN-g ELISPOT assays using pooled S peptides demonstrated T cell responses in the
majority of vaccinated animals that received the 1x1011, 5x1010, and 1.125x1010 vp doses at week
4, although there was a trend for lower responses with lower vaccine doses (Fig. 2A). In animals
that received the 2x109 vp dose, only 2 of 5 animals developed detectable ELISPOT responses

(Fig. 2A). IL-4 ELISPOT responses were undetectable (Fig. 2B), suggesting induction of Th1biased responses and consistent with prior findings6.
We next monitored B cell responses following vaccination by multiparameter flow
cytometry. SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG+ B cells were detected in peripheral blood by week
2 following vaccination and generally expressed the activation marker CD95 and the memory
marker CD27 (Fig. S2), suggesting activated memory B cells14-16. RBD-specific activated
memory B cells expanded following vaccination in a dose-dependent fashion, with robust
responses in all animals that received 1x1011 vp but marginal responses in animals that received
2x109 vp (Fig. 3). The frequency of RBD-specific activated memory B cells strongly correlated
with NAb and ELISA titers (P<0.0001, R=0.7997 and P<0.0001, R=0.8851, respectively, twosided Spearman rank-correlation tests) and moderately correlated with IFN-γ ELISPOT
responses (P=0.0063, R=0.5310) (Fig. S3).

Protective Efficacy with Reduced Ad26.COV2.S Dose Levels
We challenged all animals at week 6 with 1.0x105 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 by the
intranasal (IN) and intratracheal (IT) routes1,6,11,13. We assessed viral loads in bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) and nasal swabs (NS) by RT-PCR specific for subgenomic mRNA (sgRNA),
which is believed to measure replicating virus13,17. All 10 sham controls were infected and
showed a mean peak of 4.45 (range 3.2-6.5) log10 sgRNA copies/ml in BAL (Fig. 4A). In
contrast, vaccinated animals demonstrated no detectable virus in BAL (limit of quantitation 1.69
log10 sgRNA copies/ml), with the exception of one animal in the 2x109 vp group and one animal
in the 1.125x1010 vp group (Fig. 4A). Similarly, all sham controls showed a mean peak of 5.68
(range 3.8-6.9) log10 sgRNA in NS (Fig. 4B). In contrast with limited viral breakthroughs in the

BAL, 80% (4 of 5) of animals in the 2x109 vp group, 40% (2 of 5) of animals in the 1.125x1010
vp group, and 20% (1 of 5) of animals in the 5x1010 vp group showed viral breakthroughs in NS
(Fig. 4B). These data suggest that a higher vaccine dose may be required for protection in the
upper respiratory tract compared with protection in the lower respiratory tract. Suboptimal
vaccine dose levels led to loss of protection in NS but did not result in enhanced virus replication
compared with the sham controls.
The log10 ELISA and NAb titers at week 6 inversely correlated with peak log10 sgRNA in
BAL (P<0.0001, R=-0.8489 and P<0.0001, R=-0.8343, respectively, two-sided Spearman rankcorrelation tests; Fig. 5) and in NS (P<0.0001, R=-0.7765 and P<0.0001, R=-0.8436,
respectively, two-sided Spearman rank-correlation tests; Fig. 5). Moreover, the frequency of
RBD- and S-specific activated memory B cells inversely correlated with peak log10 sgRNA in
NS (P<0.0001, R=-0.7196 and P=0.0003, R=-0.6686, respectively, for day 14 responses;
P=0.0001, R=-0.6936 and P=0.0014, R=-0.6039, respectively, for day 28 responses; two-sided
Spearman rank-correlation tests; Fig. 6A). In addition, RBD- and S-specific activated memory B
cells were higher in completely protected animals compared with partially protected or nonprotected animals (P=0.0006 and P=0.0005, two-sided Mann–Whitney tests; Fig. 6B). Taken
together, these data show that both memory B cell responses and binding and neutralizing
antibody titers correlated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques.

Histopathology Following SARS-CoV-2 Challenge
On day 10 following challenge, animals were necropsied, and lung tissues were assessed
by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. We observed focal to locally extensive SARSCoV-2 associated pathological lesions in sham controls (Fig. 7, Table 1). We previously

reported histopathologic evidence of viral pneumonia in rhesus macaques on day 2 and day 4
following SARS-CoV-2 infection13. On day 10, lungs in sham controls still showed evidence of
multifocal interstitial pneumonia with bronchoepithelial syncytia, perivascular mononuclear
infiltrates, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, rare thrombosis, and focal edema and consolidation
(Fig. S4, Table 1). RNAscope demonstrated in situ hybridization for viral RNA,
immunohistochemistry showed staining for SARS nucleocapsid, and infiltrates included Iba-1+
macrophages, CD3+ T cells, and CD20+ B cells (Fig. S5). In contrast, vaccinated animals
showed minimal histopathologic changes, consistent with background lung pathology, although
several animals that received the 2x109 vp dose showed evidence of mild inflammation (Figs. 7,
8; Table 1). No evidence of VAERD was observed in animals that received high or suboptimal
doses of Ad26.COV2.S, including animals that showed breakthrough viral replication in BAL
and/or NS.

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrate that low doses of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine protected
rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, although higher vaccine doses were required
to protect in the upper respiratory tract as compared with the lower respiratory tract. Both
activated memory B cells and binding and neutralizing antibody titers correlated with protective
efficacy. Suboptimal vaccine dose levels led to viral breakthroughs in the upper respiratory tract,
but no virologic, immunologic, histopathologic, or clinical evidence of VAERD was observed.
These data confirm and extend prior studies in which we showed that single-shot
immunization with Ad26.COV2.S effectively protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus

macaques and against severe clinical disease in hamsters5,6. In the present study, we showed that
Ad26.COV2.S doses as low as 2x109 vp protected the lower respiratory tract, whereas doses of
1.125x1010 vp were required to protect the upper respiratory tract. This anatomic-specific
difference in protective efficacy is consistent with multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccine studies in
nonhuman primates using DNA, RNA, and Ad vector-based vaccines, which have consistently
shown superior protection in the lungs than in the nasal cavity6-8,11. These findings suggest that
future work evaluating mucosal immune responses in these anatomic compartments is warranted.
Previous studies have suggested that vaccine-elicited binding and neutralizing antibodies
correlated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques6,11 and that adoptive transfer
of purified IgG from convalescent macaques protected against SARS-CoV-2 in this model1. The
present data are consistent with these prior observations, and both RBD-specific activated
memory B cells and binding and neutralizing antibody responses correlated with protective
efficacy. Moreover, lower vaccine doses led to diminished antibody responses and reduced
protective efficacy, further suggesting the importance of humoral immunity in protection against
SARS-CoV-2. Suboptimal vaccine dose levels led to viral breakthroughs but did not result in
evidence of enhanced viral replication or increased histopathologic pathology in the lungs of
vaccinated animals compared with sham controls.
In summary, our data demonstrate that a single immunization of relatively low doses
Ad26.COV2.S protects against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques. Low dose
vaccination led to viral breakthrough in the upper respiratory tract prior to the lower respiratory
tract, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may protect against severe pneumonia
more effectively than against asymptomatic upper respiratory tract infection in humans. Two
phase 3 trials are currently in progress to determine the safety and efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S in

Animals that received a high vaccine dose had minimal evidence of SARS CoV-2 pathology (AC). Animals that received the lowest vaccine dose showed focal pathology (D-F) characterized
by increased alveolar macrophages, focal interstitial septal thickening and aggregates of
macrophages. Sham vaccinated animals had locally extensive moderate interstitial pneumonia
(G) characterized by extensive macrophage infiltrates (H) and expansion of perivascular and
interstitial CD3 T lymphocytes (I). Scale bars = 100 microns.

bronchoalveolar lavages. Each feature assessed was assigned a score of 0= no significant
findings; 1=minimal; 2= mild; 3=moderate; 4=marked/severe. Eight representative samples
from cranial, middle, and caudal lung lobes from the left and right lungs were evaluated from
each animal and were scored independently. Scores were added for all lesions across all lung
lobes for each animal for a maximum possible score of 288 for each monkey. Lungs evaluated
were inflated/suffused with 10% formalin. Horizontal lines reflect median values. Solid black
circles indicate animals that showed no virus in BAL and NS following challenge, open black
circles indicate animals that showed virus in NS but not BAL following challenge, and open red

Methods

Animals and study design. 30 outbred Indian-origin adult male and female rhesus
macaques (Macaca mulatta) were randomly allocated to groups. All animals were housed at
Bioqual, Inc. (Rockville, MD). Animals received a single immunization of 1x1011, 5x1010,
1.125x1010, or 2x109 viral particles (vp) Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen; N=5/group) or sham (N=10) by
the intramuscular route without adjuvant at week 0. At week 6, all animals were challenged with
1.0x105 TCID50 (1.2x108 RNA copies, 1.1x104 PFU) SARS-CoV-2, which was derived from
USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281; BEI Resources) and deep sequenced13. Virus was administered as
1 ml by the intranasal (IN) route (0.5 ml in each nare) and 1 ml by the intratracheal (IT) route.
All immunologic, virologic, and histopathologic studies were performed blinded. All animal
studies were conducted in compliance with all relevant local, state, and federal regulations and
were approved by the Bioqual Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Subgenomic mRNA assay. SARS-CoV-2 E gene subgenomic mRNA (sgRNA or
sgmRNA) was assessed by RT-PCR using primers and probes as previously described11,13,17.
Briefly, to generate a standard curve, the SARS-CoV-2 E gene sgRNA was cloned into a
pcDNA3.1 expression plasmid; this insert was transcribed using an AmpliCap-Max T7 High
Yield Message Maker Kit (Cellscript) to obtain RNA for standards. Prior to RT-PCR, samples
collected from challenged animals or standards were reverse-transcribed using Superscript III
VILO (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A Taqman custom gene
expression assay (ThermoFisher Scientific) was designed using the sequences targeting the E
gene sgRNA17. Reactions were carried out on a QuantStudio 6 and 7 Flex Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Standard curves

were used to calculate sgRNA in copies per ml or per swab; the quantitative assay sensitivity was
50 copies per ml or per swab.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Binding antibodies were assessed by
ELISA essentially as described11,13. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with 1 µg/ml SARSCoV-2 spike (S) or receptor binding domain (RBD) protein in 1X DPBS and incubated at 4°C
overnight. After incubation, plates were washed once with wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in 1 X
DPBS) and blocked with 350 µL Casein block/well for 2-3 h at room temperature. After
incubation, block solution was discarded and plates were blotted dry. Serial dilutions of heatinactivated serum diluted in casein block were added to wells and plates were incubated for 1 h
at room temperature, prior to three further washes and a 1 h incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of
anti-macaque IgG HRP (NIH NHP Reagent Program) at room temperature in the dark. Plates
were then washed three times, and 100 µL of SeraCare KPL TMB SureBlue Start solution was
added to each well; plate development was halted by the addition of 100 µL SeraCare KPL TMB
Stop solution per well. The absorbance at 450nm was recorded using a VersaMax or Omega
microplate reader. ELISA endpoint titers were defined as the highest reciprocal serum dilution
that yielded an absorbance > 0.2. Log10 endpoint titers are reported.
Pseudovirus neutralization assay. The SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses expressing a
luciferase reporter gene were generated in an approach similar to as described previously11-13.
Briefly, the packaging construct psPAX2 (AIDS Resource and Reagent Program), luciferase
reporter plasmid pLenti-CMV Puro-Luc (Addgene), and spike protein expressing pcDNA3.1SARS-CoV-2 SΔCT were co-transfected into HEK293T cells with calcium phosphate. The
supernatants containing the pseudotype viruses were collected 48 h post-transfection; pseudotype
viruses were purified by filtration with 0.45 µm filter. To determine the neutralization activity of

the antisera from vaccinated animals, HEK293T-hACE2 cells were seeded in 96-well tissue
culture plates at a density of 1.75 x 104 cells/well overnight. Two-fold serial dilutions of heat
inactivated serum samples were prepared and mixed with 50 µL of pseudovirus. The mixture
was incubated at 37oC for 1 h before adding to HEK293T-hACE2 cells. After 48 h, cells were
lysed in Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers were defined as the sample dilution at which a 50% reduction
in RLU was observed relative to the average of the virus control wells.
IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. ELISPOT plates were coated
with mouse anti-human IFN-γ monoclonal antibody from BD Pharmingen at a concentration of 5
µg/well overnight at 4°C, and assays were performed as described11,13. Plates were washed with
DPBS containing 0.25% Tween 20, and blocked with R10 media (RPMI with 11% FBS and
1.1% penicillin-streptomycin) for 1 h at 37°C. The Spike 1 and Spike 2 peptide pools contain 15
amino acid peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids that span the protein sequence and reflect the
N- and C- terminal halves of the protein, respectively. Spike 1 and Spike 2 peptide pools were
prepared at a concentration of 2 µg/well, and 200,000 cells/well were added. The peptides and
cells were incubated for 18-24 h at 37°C. All steps following this incubation were performed at
room temperature. The plates were washed with coulter buffer and incubated for 2 h with Rabbit
polyclonal anti-human IFN-γ Biotin from U-Cytech (1 µg/mL). The plates are washed a second
time and incubated for 2 h with Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase antibody from Southern
Biotechnology (1 µg/mL). The final wash was followed by the addition of Nitor-blue
Tetrazolium Chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro 3 ‘indolyl phosphate p-toludine salt (NBT/BCIP
chromagen) substrate solution for 7 min. The chromagen was discarded and the plates were

washed with water and dried in a dim place for 24 h. Plates were scanned and counted on a
Cellular Technologies Limited Immunospot Analyzer.
IL-4 ELISPOT assay. Precoated monoclonal antibody IL-4 ELISPOT plates (Mabtech)
were washed and blocked. The assay was then performed as described above except the
development time with NBT/BCIP chromagen substrate solution was 12 min.
B cell immunophenotyping. Fresh PBMCs were stained with Aqua live/dead dye for 20
min, washed with 2% FBS/DPBS buffer, and cells were suspended in 2% FBS/DPBS buffer with
Fc Block (BD) for 10 min, followed by staining with monoclonal antibodies against CD45 (clone
D058-1283, BUV805), CD3 (clone SP34.2 , APC-Cy7), CD7 (clone M-T701, Alexa700),
CD123 (clone 6H6, Alexa700), CD11c (clone 3.9, Alexa700), CD20 (clone 2H7, PE-Cy5), IgA
(goat polyclonal antibodies, APC), IgG (clone G18-145, BUV737), IgM (clone G20-127,
BUV396), IgD (goat polyclonal antibodies, PE), CD80 (clone L307.4, BV786), CD95 (clone
DX2, BV711), CD27 (clone M-T271, BUV563), CD21 (clone B-ly4, BV605), CD14 (clone
M5E2, BV570), CD138 (clone DL-101, PE-CF594), and staining with SARS-CoV-2 antigens
including biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins (Sino Biological) and full-length SARSCoV-2 spike proteins (Sino Biological) labeled with FITC and DyLight 405, at 4 °C for 30 min.
After staining, cells were washed twice with 2% FBS/DPBS buffer, followed by incubation with
BV650 streptavidin (BD Pharmingen) for 10min, then washed twice with 2% FBS/DPBS buffer.
For intracellular staining, cells were permeabilized using Caltag Fix & Perm (Invitrogen), then
stained with monoclonal antibodies against Ki67 (clone B56, PerCP-cy5.5) and IRF4 (clone 3E4,
PE-Cy7). After staining, cells were washed and fixed by 2% paraformaldehyde. All data were
acquired on a BD FACSymphony flow cytometer. Subsequent analyses were performed using
FlowJo software (Treestar, v.9.9.6). For analyses, in singlet gate, dead cells were excluded by

Aqua dye and CD45 was used as a positive inclusion gate for all leukocytes. Within classswitched B cell population gated as CD20+IgG+IgM-IgD-CD3-CD14-CD11c-CD123-CD7-,
SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific B cells were identified as double positive for SARS-CoV-2 RBD
and spike proteins, and SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific B cells were identified as double positive for
SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins labeled with different fluorescent probes. The SARS-CoV-2specific B cells were further distinguished according to CD21/CD27 phenotype distribution:
activated memory B cells (CD21-CD27+) and resting memory B cells (CD21+CD27+).
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry. At time of fixation, lungs were suffused
with 10% formalin to expand the alveoli. All tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and blocks
sectioned at 5 µm. Slides were baked for 30-60 min at 65 degrees then deparaffinized in xylene
and rehydrated through a series of graded ethanol to distilled water. Heat induced epitope
retrieval (HIER) was performed using a pressure cooker on steam setting for 25 minutes in
citrate buffer (Thermo; AP-9003-500) followed by treatment with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Slides
were then rinsed in distilled water and protein blocked (BioCare, BE965H) for 15 min followed
by rinses in 1x phosphate buffered saline. Primary rabbit anti-SARS-nucleoprotein antibody
(Novus; NB100-56576) diluted 1:250, rabbit anti-Iba-1 antibody (Wako; 019-19741) diluted
1:250; rabbit anti- CD3 antibody (Sigma, SAB5500057) diluted 1:300, rabbit anti- CD20
(Invitrogen PA5-16701) diluted 1:750 followed by rabbit Mach-2 HRP-Polymer (BioCare;
RHRP520L) for 30 minutes then counterstained with hematoxylin followed by bluing using
0.25% ammonia water. Labeling was performed on a Biocare IntelliPATH autostainer. All
antibodies were incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Tissue pathology was assessed
independently by two board-certified veterinary pathologists (AJM, RC).

RNAscope. RNAscope in situ hybridization was performed as previously described13
using SARS-CoV2 anti-sense specific probe v-nCoV2019-S (ACD Cat. No. 848561) targeting
the positive-sense viral RNA and DapB (ACD Cat.No 310043) as a negative control. In brief,
after slides were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a series of graded ethanol to
distilled water, retrieval was performed for 30 min in ACD P2 retrieval buffer (ACD Cat. No.
322000) at 95-98°C, followed by treatment with protease III (ACD Cat. No. 322337) diluted
1:10 in PBS for 20 min at 40°C. Slides were then incubated with 3% H2O2 in PBS for 10
minutes at room temperature. Slides were developed using the RNAscope® 2.5 HD Detection
Reagents-RED (ACD Cat. No.322360).
Statistical analyses. Analysis of virologic and immunologic data was performed using
GraphPad Prism 8.4.2 (GraphPad Software). Comparison of data between groups was
performed using two-sided Mann-Whitney tests. Correlations were assessed by two-sided
Spearman rank-correlation tests. P-values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.

Table 1. Histopathology scoring of lung lesions in vaccinated and sham animals following SARS-CoV-2 challenge.
Eight lung tissue sections representing one section from each of 7 lung lobes, and two sections from the left cranial lobe,
were processed histologically and evaluated microscopically for the histopathological findings listed in the table. The
listed histopathological findings were graded on a scale of 0-5, with grade 0 representing no findings, grade 1 minimal
histological change, 2: mild, 3: moderate, 4: marked and 5: severe/massive histological change. Histopathology grades
were tallied for all lung sections, and average scores for each group were calculated. Total histopathology scores were
calculated by adding up scores for the individual pathology parameters. BALT: bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue
