Abstract
Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) are a class of antibody mimetics with a high and mostly unexplored potential in
drug development. They are clinically validated and thus represent a true alternative to classical immunoglobulin formats.
In contrast to immunoglobulins, they are built from solenoid
protein domains comprising an N-terminal capping repeat, one
or more internal repeats and a C-terminal capping repeat. By
using in silico analysis and a rationally guided Ala-Scan, we
identified position 17 of the N-terminal capping repeat to play
a key role for the overall protein thermostability. The melting
temperature of a DARPin domain with a single full-consensus
internal repeat was increased by about 8°C to 10°C when the
original Asp17 was replaced by Leu, Val, Ile, Met, Ala or Thr,
as shown by high-temperature unfolding experiments at equilibrium. We then transferred the Asp17Leu mutation to various backgrounds, including different N- and C-terminal capping repeats and clinically validated DARPin domains, such as
the VEGF-binding ankyrin repeat domain of abicipar pegol.
In all cases, the proteins remained monomeric and showed improvements in the thermostability of about 8°C to 16°C. Thus,
the replacement of Asp17 seems to be generically applicable
to this drug class. Molecular dynamics simulations show that
the Asp17Leu mutation reduces electrostatic repulsion and improves van-der-Waals packing, rendering the DARPin domain
less flexible and more stable. Interestingly, such a beneficial
Asp17Leu mutation is present in the N-terminal caps of three
of the five DARPin domains of ensovibep, a SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor currently in clinical development. This mutation is
likely responsible, at least in part, for the very high melting temperature (>90°C) of this promising anti-Covid-19 drug. Overall,
such N-terminal capping repeats with increased thermostability
seem to be beneficial for the development of innovative drugs
based on DARPins.

Introduction
DARPins are a class of antibody mimetics, that have been
conceived and developed about two decades ago at the University of Zurich 1–3 . Their application as research tool and
protein therapeutic was recently reviewed 4 . Originally de-

vised as an alternative to immunoglobulins (“antibodies”),
the potential of DARPins in protein engineering, directed
evolution of binders and drug development became obvious
immediately at inception. Importantly, this potential extends
beyond areas of applications that have classically been “occupied” by recombinant immunoglobulins. The DARPin scaffold was shown to serve as an alternative 5 , as a complementation 6 and as an expansion of what is possible with binders
derived from immunoglobulins 7,8 . Translation of academic
research in DARPin technology towards pharmaceutical benefits has been predominantly steered by Molecular Partners,
who provided the fundamental clinical validation of the scaffold 9 . However, in light of the long generation cycles in
drug development – especially in the case of biologics that
typically require ten years from concept to drug approval the DARPin technology can still be regarded as young and
emerging and the full potential of DARPins as a class of biologics has yet to be realized. The recent development of ensovibep 10 , a multi-specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 DARPin, which
has entered clinical trials in November 2020 in less than nine
months after initial research and development activities had
commenced, reinforces this high potential 11,12 .
DARPins are based on natural ankyrin repeat proteins 13 , that
have evolved to mediate various kinds of protein-protein interactions in all kingdoms of life 14 . Their structure is simpler than that of immunoglobulins. Whereas immunoglobulins naturally consist of four polypeptide chains, and unite
more than four chains in recombinant formats like T-cell
bispecifics (TCBs) 15 , a single polypeptide chain is sufficient to form a multispecific DARPin 16 . For example, ensovibep 10 combines five DARPin domains on a single polypeptide chain, in which two domains bind human serum albumin
(HSA) and three domains associate with the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein 11 . DARPins are built from solenoid protein domains, which possess a modular architecture that was derived
by a consensus design approach 2,17,18 : a stack of internal
ankyrin repeats, each composed of 33 amino acids, flanked
by N- and C-terminal capping repeats (N- and C-Caps) that
function to seal the hydrophobic core of the protein domain
(Figure 1). Together these structural units form an elongated
ankyrin repeat domain. Amino acids present at defined positions at the surface of the internal repeats form a paratope,

enabling the binding to target proteins with high affinity and
specificity 3,19,20 . These positions are randomized in DARPin
libraries, which are used as starting point for in vitro selection, most prominently by means of ribosome display 21 ,
to generate highly-specific target binding molecules. Originally, the N- and C-Caps of DARPins were taken from the
human guanine-adenine-binding protein (hGABP_beta1) as
they could be adapted to fit to the consensus designed internal repeats 2 . Such original N- and C-Caps are also present
in the first DARPin that became clinically validated - abicipar pegol . Despite the clinical validation, most of the amino
acid sequence of these original caps was not optimized, indicating that there may be room for further improvements, in
particular for those that increase DARPin thermostability.
In general, we identify three major motivations that fuel the
quest for increased thermostability of biologics: (i) Reduction of aggregation and thus reduction of immunogenicity
risk, (ii) simplification of chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) processes, thus bringing down the manufacturing costs, and reduction of cold-chain-drug storage requirements and (iii) increase of degrees of freedom for protein engineering to allow for mode-of-action design, for example, advanced multispecificity 11 , receptor fine-tuning 22
and proximity-based activation 23 . For the thermostability of
DARPins, the importance of the capping repeats – particularly the C-Cap – was first shown by Interlandi and coworkers 24 . Seven point mutations, five of which are located in the
interface to the preceding internal repeat and two at the very
C-terminus, were introduced to optimize the C-Cap and were
shown to increase the melting temperature (T m ) of a model
DARPin, consisting of an N-Cap, a single full-consensus repeat and a C-Cap by about 17°C; i.e. from 60°C (wt) to 77°C
(the respective C-Cap variant was referred to as the “mut5”
C-Cap) 24 . When this improved mut5 C-Cap was compared to
the original C-Cap 2 , a rigid-body movement of the C-Cap towards the internal repeat was observed, as evidenced by crystallographic data 25 . This movement results in an increased
buried surface area and a superior complementarity of the
interface between the internal repeat and the C-Cap, which
explains the improved thermostability.
While the C-Cap of DARPins was thoroughly investigated,
we are not aware of any scientific article describing a
corresponding analysis or thermostability improvement
of the original N-Cap (denoted as “N01” N-Cap in the
following, (Figure 2)), which is still predominantly used
by the research community. Nevertheless, thermostability
improvements of the N-Cap have been published in the
patent application WO2012/069655 (WO’655) and are
clinically validated in the aHSA domains of ensovibep 10 .
The corresponding N-Cap of WO’655 is denoted “N02” in
the following (Figure 2). Comparing N02 with the original
N-Cap, N01, resulted in a T m increase of approximately
7°C. It is likely that this improvement mainly arises from the
Met24Leu-mutation present in N02, which removes the only
methionine (besides the methionine encoded by the start
codon) from the original DARPin sequence, and thereby also
removes this hotspot for oxidation. The N-Cap analysis of

we identify N-Cap Asp17 as an Achilles heel of DARPin domains. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and MD trajectory analysis provide an explanation for the significantly
increased T m values observed upon Asp17 replacement in
DARPin domains.

Results
Choice of a minimal DARPin as model system

We chose a three repeat DARPin domain (denoted as N1C
in the following) consisting of one full-consensus internal repeat (IR) flanked by an N- and C-Cap as a model DARPin
to screen for improved thermostability (see Table 1 for an
overview of the different DARPin domains used, as well as
Table S1 for their respective sequences). The choice of this
DARPin model has a three-fold motivation. First, it has the
minimal DARPin architecture consisting of only three repeats
with two repeat interfaces, one between the N-Cap and the
IR and one between the IR and the C-Cap. Second, using a
consensus IR that represents an “average structure” of all the
natural ankyrin repeats should eliminate interferences originating from amino acids at randomized positions or possible
framework mutations, that may only be present in particular sequences 18 . Third, since DARPins get more stable with
increasing number of IRs, we choose to have only one internal repeat and thus a low starting thermostability 28 such that
stability improvements are readily observable.

Thermostable DARPins as building blocks for innovative drugs

Importance of the N-Cap position 17 for the overall
thermostability of DARPins

By visual analysis of the DARPin structure, we identified
four residues within the N-Cap to be of potential importance
for the repeat stacking and thereby also for the overall domain stability. These residues are either at the edge (Leu4,
Gly5, Asp17) of the N-Cap or buried (Met24) at the interface
between N-Cap and the adjacent IR (Figure 3). As WO’655
already demonstrated that a Met24Leu mutation strongly improves the thermostability of DARPins, we focused our analysis on Leu4, Gly5 and Asp17 on an N1C background comprising the N02 N-Cap to find out if it is possible to further improve the most stable N-Cap known to date. Alanine scanning of residues 4 and 5 showed no improvement
in thermostability, with Leu4Ala lowering the T m value from
74.5°C to 64.7°C and Gly5Ala leaving the melting temperature unaltered at 74.3°C. However, the Asp17Ala mutation
showed a strong improvement of the T m value from 74.5°C to
82.4°C (Figure 4A). Consequently, we screened alternative
amino acids at the N-Cap position 17 of N1C (Table 2 and
Figure 4B). All amino acid substitutions tested resulted in
a T m increase, with the highest T m increases being measured
for the Asp17Val, Asp17Ile and Asp17Leu variants (i.e. from
74.5°C to 85.1°C, 84.8°C and 84.6°C, respectively). Overall,
changing Asp17 in N1C to Val, Leu, Ile, Met, Ala or Thr
led to an increase of the respective T m values between 8°C
to 10°C. These results show that Asp is an exceptionally unfavorable amino acid at position 17 and that there are many
alternative residues resulting in a strong thermostability gain.
Of these alternative residues, Asp17Leu provided one of the
largest improvements, which we investigated further.
The increased thermostability of the Asp17Leu N-Cap
mutation is independent of the N- and C-Cap background

To test if the improvements derived from mutating the NCap Asp17 are generic and independent of the N02 background, we transferred the Asp17Leu mutation onto the original N01 N-Cap and the N03 N-Cap, that differs in nine amino
acids from N02. The Asp17Leu mutation improved the thermostability of N1C also in the N01 and N03 backgrounds
by more than 13°C (Table 3). Further, we were interested
in whether our observed stability improvement based on the
N-Cap and the stability improvement based on the mut5 CCap 24 would be additive. We first found that replacing the wt
C-Cap in N1C with a mut5 C-Cap results in a T m increase of
about 13°C or 9°C in an N01 or N02 background, respecbioRχiv

tively (Table 4), thus confirming the benefits of the mut5
C-Cap 24 . Additionally, the combination of the N02 N-Cap
with the mut5 C-Cap in N1C_v22 proved that the individual improvements of each cap are additive, and raised the T m
value to 84.2°C in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), i.e. by
about 22°C. With the additional substitution of Asp17Leu
in N1C_v23 (N02, mut5 background) we did not observe
any unfolding transition up to 95°C when we measured the
thermal unfolding of this molecule in PBS. Therefore, we
repeated the measurements for N1C_v22 and N1C_v23 in
a buffer containing 2 M GdmCl and obtained corresponding T m values of 67.3°C and 79.3°C, respectively (Table
4). Thus, the already very thermostable N1C_v22, comprising N02 and the mut5 C-Cap, could be further stabilized by
adding the Asp17Leu mutation to its N-Cap resulting in a T m
gain of about 12°C in 2 M GdmCl. Overall, the Asp17Leu
mutation adds about 9°C to 14°C to the T m value of N1C
independent of its concrete N- and/or C-Cap, indicating that
this is a general improvement for DARPin domains.

implications for N1C variants having either Asp or Leu at

clusions can be drawn from the MD simulations (Figure 5
and Table 5). First, the substitution of Asp at position 17
with Leu leads in all instances to improved interaction energies with the surrounding (Table 5). Second, the analysis focused on the protein flexibility at high temperatures (400 K),
revealed that the systems containing Leu at position 17 systematically show lower fluctuations than their Asp17 counterparts (Figure 5). The reduced flexibility of the Leu17 mutants as compared to Asp17 is in line with the increased thermostability of Asp17Leu DARPins observed in CD. Third,
when examining the regions of reduced fluctuation, we found
that the Asp17Leu mutation reduces fluctuations in the N01background (N1C_v16 vs. N1C_v17) across the entire NCap and in one of the most flexible parts of a DARPin domain spanning from the end of the N-Cap (GADVNA motif,
see (Figure 2) to the β-turn at the beginning of the internal
repeat. In the N02-background (N1C_v01 vs. N1C_v05),
reduced fluctuations through the Asp17Leu mutation are restricted to the direct vicinity of position 17 and around position 32, which is in line with the fact that N02 carries a
stabilizing Met24Leu mutation. In the background comprising N02 and the mut5 C-Cap (N1C_v22 vs. N1C_v23) reduced fluctuations through the Asp17Leu mutation are only
present in the direct vicinity of position 17. No fluctuation
differences are observed around N-Cap position 32, which
may be explained by the stabilizing effects introduced by the
improved mut5 C-Cap that is structurally adjacent to this region. These findings further support our hypothesis that position 17 is an Achilles heel with regard to the N-Cap and thus
the overall DARPin domain thermostability.
The Asp17Leu N-Cap mutation improves the stability
of clinically validated DARPins

To test whether the observed thermostability gain derived
from the N-Cap Asp17Leu is independent on the compoTable 4. T m values of N1C variants having either Asp or Leu at

fers, the Asp17Leu mutation increased the thermostability of
the DARPin domains and added up to about 15°C in 2 M
GdmCl T m measurements (Table 6). Overall, the described
significant gain in thermostability of the Asp17Leu mutation
proved to be generic and is transferable to different N- and CCap backgrounds and different library members selected for
high affinity, including clinically validated DARPin domains.

Discussion
The results presented in this paper identify position 17 of the
DARPin N-Cap as a key position influencing thermostability
of DARPins. The importance of the capping repeats as a prerequisite for the high stability and robustness of the DARPinfold has been known since the first description of this antibody mimetic 28,29 . While the C-Cap has been thoroughly
analyzed for residues providing room for improvement previously 24 , an analogous dissection of the N-Cap in the literature, with exception of WO’655, has been missing.
The N-Cap contributes significantly to the thermostability of DARPins

The contribution of the capping repeats to the overall stability of the DARPin domain is central 28 . The architecture of
solenoid repeat protein domains does not rely on long-range
interactions (distant in sequence), which is a fundamental difference to globular proteins. In repeat proteins, stabilizing
and structure-determining interactions are formed within a
repeat and between neighboring repeats. In contrast to IRs,
capping repeats have only one stabilizing neighboring repeat
(Figure 1). Both natural 31 and designed ankyrin repeat proteins 28 have been shown to unfold in a sequential manner
starting with the capping repeats. An unfolded cap leads to
an internal repeat losing a stabilizing neighbor resulting in
destabilization of the whole repeat domain. Furthermore, the
original N- and C-Caps of DARPins correspond mainly to the
natural caps of hGABP_beta1 2 ; and thus there may be room
for improvements. Indeed, improving the original capping repeats can increase the overall stability of a DARPin domain
as it was shown for the N-Cap (WO’655) and the C-Cap 24 .
The improved N02 N-Cap of WO’655 comprises a Met24Leu
mutation when compared to N01 (Table 2), thereby improving the thermostability of DARPin domains. Since Met possesses a larger side chain than Leu it might not optimally

fit into the confined space at the interface between the NCap and the adjacent internal repeat. This mutation has the
additional advantage that it eliminates an oxidation hotspot
from the DARPin domain; unwanted oxidation of Met and its
negative impact on the bioactivity of biologics is well documented 32 .
We now performed a detailed analysis of the N-Cap, searching for additional mutations that may improve the overall DARPin domain stability. Following in silico analyses,
we used equilibrium thermal denaturation experiments of
DARPins harboring different N-Cap mutations. Intriguingly,
our studies show that position 17 of the N-Cap is an important
Achilles heel of a DARPin domain and that the original Asp
at position 17 of the N-Cap is detrimental to overall DARPin
thermostability. We showed that the negative effect on thermostability of Asp17 can be rescued by mutating it to Leu,
Val, Ile, Ala, Met or Thr, leading to a profound improvement
in T m values by about 8°C to 16°C depending on the individual construct tested. Importantly, the T m value of an N1C
variant comprising the N02 N-Cap (instead of N01) was also
increased by about 9°C when introducing the Asp17Leu mutation. Thus, the beneficial effect of this mutation synergizes
with the T m improvement of about 7°C previously reported
for N02 (WO’655). While Interlandi et al. reported that the
C-Cap is a limiting factor for the thermostability of the original DARPin domain 24 , our results demonstrate that this is
also the case for the N-Cap.

Thermostable DARPins as building blocks for innovative drugs

Asp17 replacements seem to improve the N-Cap/IR interface

The N-Cap position 17 is located at the beginning of helix
2 at the edge of the interface between the N-Cap and
the adjacent IR (IR1) (Figure 6A). Throughout nature,
negatively charged amino acids are found at the N-terminal
turn of helices as they support helix formation during
protein folding 33 , which rationalizes the placement of Asp at
position 17. Known DARPin crystal structures show that the
side chain of Asp17 can either face inwards and be buried
in the interface between N-Cap and IR1, or face outwards
into the surrounding solvent. If Asp17 is facing inwards,
it is involved in van-der-Waals (VDW) contacts with IR1
(i.e. to the sidechains and backbones of IR1 Glu19 and IR1
Ile20), but is burdened with a desolvation penalty, which
negatively impacts thermodynamic stability (Figure 6A). If
facing outwards, Asp17 shields the hydrophobic interface
from the solvent, but experiences repulsive forces to the
equally negatively charged IR1 Glu19 (Figure 6B).

Asp17

The Asp17Leu N-Cap mutation is universally applicable to DARPins

Importantly, the observed stability improvement of about 8°C
to 16°C (depending on the concrete context) that was caused
by the N-Cap Asp17Leu mutation, proved to be generically
applicable to various sequence backgrounds. First, as observed by CD measurements and supported through MD
simulations, stabilization could be consistently achieved on
a diverse set of N-Cap backgrounds grafted on the model
DARPin N1C. The tested N-Cap backgrounds include the
original N01, N02 of the two HSA-binding domains of ensovibep, N03 where 12 out of the 32 amino acids are changed
in comparison to N01, and N04, present in the VEGF binding
domain of abicipar pegol (Figure 2). Second, the Asp17Leu
mutation was also beneficial in the context of the improved
mut5 C-Cap. Third, Asp17Leu gave a constant improvement when transferred to three different DARPin binders directed against HER2 20 , VEGF 27 , or HSA 30 , indicating that
the observed profound improvement is independent of the
randomized positions forming the DARPin paratope. This
general transferability of the Asp17Leu mutation may be due
to the fact that all DARPin domains are based on a quasiSchilling et al.

Analyses of equilibrated, energy-minimized average MD
structures at 300 K and associated interactions between the
N-Cap residue 17 and its surrounding at 350 K show that although in our starting model Asp17 faced inwards, during the
course of the simulation Asp17 (Figure 6C and Table 5) is
facing outwards as described above avoiding the desolvation
penalty, but experiencing electrostatic repulsive forces to the
IR1 Glu19. Importantly, the MD simulations show that Leu
at position 17 faces inwards and that the Asp17Leu mutation
improves the Coulombic and the VDW interactions by about
3 kcal/mol and 2 kcal/mol, respectively (Figure 6D and Table 5). The improved interactions of Leu17 are consistent
with the surprisingly strong increase in thermostability observed by CD measurements.

identical framework embedding the randomized positions 29 .
The underlying reason for this similarity of the framework
is the consensus design of DARPins, resulting in the stacking of self-compatible IRs 1,2,18 . However, even the investigated DARPin domains aVEGF and aHER2 that possess
framework mutations, which are key for their low picomolar
binding affinities, still profit from the Asp17Leu mutation.
This indicates that this single amino acid change may also be
beneficial for DARPin domains comprising framework mutations; in particular, when these mutations have a negative
effect on the domain stability.
Analyses of known X-ray structures of DARPins in complex
with their respective targets have shown that N- and C-Caps
contribute to the DARPin paratope in approximately 35%
of cases 35 . Position 17 is located outside of these known
paratope regions and our MD based structural analyses indicate that the overall alteration of the domain structure through
the Asp17Leu mutation is marginal. Thus, we do not expect
that the N-Cap Asp17Leu change has a significant impact on
the target binding of corresponding DARPin domains. Incorporation of the Asp17Leu mutation into existing DARPin
binders could increase their thermostability without significantly impacting their target binding properties.
Quantitative dimension and additive nature of the
Asp17Leu improvement

The benefit obtained by this novel N-Cap (i.e., a T m increase
of 8°C to 16°C for a DARPin domain) is similar in dimension to that described for the C-Cap by Interlandi et al. 24 .

tion in an additive manner, thereby yielding a T m increase of
approximately 20°C when combined. Similarly, the stability
improvement of the novel N-Cap mutation Asp17Leu is additive to the stability gain obtained through the known N-Cap
mutation Met24Leu (WO’655). When compared to the original DARPins 1,2 , in sum, the two improvements at the N-Cap
(each increasing the T m value by approximately 10°C) and
the improvement at the C-Cap can thereby yield a total T m
increase of approximately 30°C for a DARPin domain. Thus,
our discovered Asp17Leu improvement adds substantially to
other capping repeat improvements described previously. We
see the modular, solenoid structure of DARPins as the origin
for making the observed modular addition of thermostability improvements possible. DARPins are assembled through
stacking of repeat units that are structurally “self-organized”,
yet connected. They are stabilized by interactions with their
folded immediate neighboring repeats and thus each repeat
individually contributes to the overall domain stability 28 .
Ease of engineering of DARPins and impact on their
versatility

DARPins unify a plethora of key characteristics beneficial
for drug development from discovery to preclinical and clinical development, and manufacturing. For example, their
low molecular weight, high solubility, high expression level,
picomolar affinities, multispecific potential, and especially
the high stability offer drug developers access to huge versatility 9 . With their simple modular structure, multispecific
DARPins 16 can be easily constructed with a single polypeptide chain and different molecular formats, as the binding
domains are freely combinable. Their high solubility and
high expression level awards them with unparalleled highthroughput capabilities and their excellent biophysical properties are the origin for low attrition rates. Their high thermostability, in particular, positively influences low aggregation and associated immunogenicity risks, allows for lowcost manufacturing and makes them very amenable to protein engineering to generate molecules with novel modes of
action, such as receptor fine-tuning 22 . With these characteristics DARPins complement existing therapeutic antibodies and will also expand the scope of innovative drugs via
the multitude of advanced formats and applications that can
be conceived and realized with this scaffold. All mentioned
characteristics build on the stability of this versatile scaffold.
Thus, an increased thermostability as presented in this study
will have a positive impact on many levels.
Significance for clinical DARPins

A recent example of drug development at unparalleled speed
is the development of the multi-specific, highly efficacious
anti-SARS-CoV-2 DARPin ensovibep that went from first selection of binders to entry into the clinic in less than nine
months 12 . Interestingly, ensovibep contains the Asp17Leu
mutation described here in three of its five DARPin domains 10 . This not only gives clinical validation to the
Asp17Leu mutation, but also underscores the importance and
reach of the findings outlined here. The high thermosta8

bility (T m > 90°C) and absence of any tendency for aggregation (up to 85°C) reported for ensovibep 11 may thus
be partly explained by the presence of the Asp17Leu mutation. These beneficial properties are especially remarkable
as this COVID-19 antiviral drug is composed of five distinct DARPin domains with four different specificities on a
single polypeptide chain. In our view, an immunoglobulinbased drug with similar properties would require extensive
engineering to be generated, if feasible at all. Together, it
does not surprise that Molecular Partners is speculating that
ensovibep has the potential to bypass cold storage and that it
provides a superior alternative to monoclonal antibody cocktails for global supply 12 . Besides the three DARPin domains
binding to three unique epitopes of the spike ectodomain of
SARS-CoV-2, that all carry Asp17Leu in their N-Caps, ensovibep is additionally composed of two anti-HSA DARPins
for serum half-life extension. These two domains are identical to aHSA of our study. As suggested by our findings, the
overall stability of ensovibep might be even further improved
by replacement of Asp17 with Leu, Val, Ile, Ala, Met or Thr
in the N-Cap of the two anti-HSA DARPins.
Furthermore, aVEGF of our study corresponds to the ankyrin
repeat domain of abicipar pegol that is a first generation
DARPin drug to treat patients with neovascular age-related
macular degeneration (AMD). Two randomized phase 3 clinical trials (CEDAR and SEQUOIA) demonstrated that quarterly applied abicipar pegol is noninferior to monthly applied ranibizumab, but showed a higher-level of intraocular
inflammation (typically mild or moderate in severity) than
ranibizumab 36 . The authors of these phase 3 studies mentioned that the used abicipar pegol was further purified to
reduce host cell proteins with the goal to minimize the incidence of intraocular inflammation. As indicated by our
findings, the thermostability of the ankyrin repeat domain of
abicipar pegol could be increased by about 30°C when combining our results with the previously described cap improvements. A correspondingly improved abicipar pegol would be
amenable to more stringent purification processes that may
result in much lower contaminations with host cell proteins.

Conclusions
We have shown a T m increase of various DARPin domains
(up to 16°C) by replacing Asp17 in the N-Cap with Leu, Val,
Ile, Ala, Met or Thr. Our results further provide evidence for
the importance of the capping repeats for the robustness and
reliability of this solenoid scaffold. Combining our N-Cap
improvement with the cap enhancements described by Interlandi et al. 24 and WO’655, increases the melting temperature
of original DARPin domains by about 30°C. Even though
the initial DARPin design 1,2 is successfully used by the research community and is clinically validated (abicipar pegol),
this significant improvement of the T m indicates that the capping repeats of the original DARPins, which were based on
hGABP_beta1, have high liabilities that can be eliminated by
a few mutations in the capping repeats. Such thermodynamically stabilized antibody mimetics could pave the way for the
future development of innovative drugs. First, increased therSchilling et al.

mostability of biologics is known to correlate with a reduced
aggregation propensity 37 . Thus, we anticipate an even lower
immunogenicity risk of DARPins comprising the N-Caps described herein. Second, improved thermostability will make
DARPins even more amenable to protein engineering. We
believe that this is of high importance when the biological
activity of a drug needs to be optimized, for example, to
fine-tune the activation of receptors 22 . Third, increased thermostability will translate into more efficient preclinical development and CMC processes, low-cost manufacturing and
may even help to bypass cold storage of biologics. The recent development of the DARPin ensovibep (comprising the
N-Cap Asp17Leu mutation) in less than nine months from
idea conception to entry into the clinics underlines this huge
potential 11,12 . Along the same lines, we speculate that a high
thermostability may facilitate the development of aerosol or
dry powder inhaler formulations of DARPin drugs; something that may also be of interest for the pulmonary delivery
of ensovibep for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, future drug development asks for more robust and
very versatile biologics and we believe that DARPins would
be the ideal scaffold for this.

Methods
Cloning

The DNA sequence encoding each ankyrin repeat domain
was chemically synthesized and cloned into pQIq expression
vectors (Qiagen, Germany) by Gibson Assembly 38 .
Protein expression and purification

The ankyrin repeat domains were expressed in E. coli XL1Blue cells and purified using their His-tag by standard protocols. Briefly, 25 ml of stationary overnight cultures (LB,
1% glucose, 100 mg/l of ampicillin; 37°C) were used to inoculate 1 l cultures (same medium). At an absorbance of
about 1 at 600 nm, the cultures were induced with 0.5 mM
IPTG and incubated at 37°C for 4 h. The cultures were centrifuged and the resulting pellets were resuspended in 40 ml
of TBS500 (50 mM Tris–HCl, 500 mM NaCl, pH 8) and sonicated. The lysate was recentrifuged, and glycerol (10% (v/v)
final concentration) and imidazole (20 mM final concentration) were added to the resulting supernatant. The ankyrin
repeat domains were purified over a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid
column (2.5 ml column volume) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (QIAgen, Germany). Up to 200 mg of
highly soluble ankyrin repeat domains were purified from one
liter of E. coli culture with a purity > 95% as estimated from
SDS-PAGE.
Circular Dichroism measurements

The circular dichroism (CD) signal of DARPin domains at 10
µM in PBS, pH 7.4 (PBS, 2 M GdmCl, pH 7.4, where indicated) were recorded at 222 nm in a Jasco J-810 instrument
(Jasco, Japan) using a 1 mm pathlength cuvette. Samples
were heated from 20°C to 95°C using a temperature ramp rate
of 1°C per min, collecting data periodically at 0.5°C intervals. Melting temperature values were derived as described

by Consalvi et al. 39 . Importantly, all constructs assessed
in CD ran as monomeric peaks in analytical size-exclusion
chromatography (aSEC).
Molecular Dynamics simulations

System preparation. Starting from the X-ray diffraction structure of ankyrin repeat proteins of E3_5, NI1Cmut4 and NI3 C-mut5 (PDB ID: 1MJ0 29 , 2XEN 25 and
2XEE 25 , respectively), homology modelling was used to
construct atomic resolution models of six different repeat
proteins, i.e., N1C_v16, N1C_v17, N1C_v01, N1C_v02,
N1C_v22 and N1C_v23.
The sequences of the proteins are shown in Supplementary Table S1. These
models are used as the structural basis of this study.
Simulation protocol. All simulations were carried out using the GROMACS 2018.6 simulation package 40 and the
CHARMM36m force field 41 . Three independent simulations
with different initial random velocities were carried out for
each repeat protein, two at 350 K and one at 400 K, cumulating 1.8 µs for each protein. To reproduce neutral pH conditions, standard protonation states were used for the ionizable
side chains, while the N-terminus was positively charged, and
the C-terminus negatively charged. Each protein was solvated in a cubic box (edge length of 6.9 nm) with TIP3P water
molecules 42 to which 150 mM NaCl were added, including
neutralizing counterions. Following steepest descent minimization, the simulation systems were first equilibrated under
constant pressure for 5 ns, with position restraints applied on
the heavy atoms, and subsequently under constant temperature (T = 300 K) in absence of restraints for 5 ns. For the
production simulations, temperature and pressure were maintained constant at 350 K or 400 K and 1 atm, by using the
modified Berendsen thermostat (0.1 ps coupling) 43 and barostat (2 ps coupling) 44 . The short-range interactions were cut
off beyond a distance of 1.2 nm and the potential smoothly
decays to zero using the Verlet cutoff scheme. The Particle
Mesh Ewald (PME) technique 45 with a cubic interpolation
order, a real space cut-off of 1.2 nm and a grid spacing of
0.16 nm was employed to compute the long-range interactions. Bond lengths were constrained using a fourth order
LINCS algorithm 46 with 2 iterations. In all simulations the
time step was fixed to 4 fs, enabled through the use of virtual
sites for all hydrogen atoms. Periodic boundary conditions
were applied and the snapshots were saved every 50 ps. The
elevated temperature is employed to enhance the sampling;
the density of water is kept at the value corresponding to 300
K to perturb the free energy surface as little as possible 47 .
