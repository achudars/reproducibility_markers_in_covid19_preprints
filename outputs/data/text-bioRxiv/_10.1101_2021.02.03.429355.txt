Abstract
The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) with the ACE2
receptor on host cells is essential for viral entry. RBD is the dominant target for neutralizing
antibodies and several neutralizing epitopes on RBD have been molecularly characterized.
Analysis of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants has revealed mutations arising in the RBD, the
N-terminal domain (NTD) and S2 subunits of Spike. To fully understand how these mutations
affect the antigenicity of Spike, we have isolated and characterized neutralizing antibodies
targeting epitopes beyond the already identified RBD epitopes. Using recombinant Spike as
a sorting bait, we isolated >100 Spike-reactive monoclonal antibodies from SARS-CoV-2
infected individuals. ~45% showed neutralizing activity of which ~20% were NTD-specific.
None of the S2-specific antibodies showed neutralizing activity. Competition ELISA revealed
that NTD-specific mAbs formed two distinct groups: the first group was highly potent against
infectious virus, whereas the second was less potent and displayed glycan-dependant
neutralization activity. Importantly, mutations present in B.1.1.7 Spike frequently conferred
resistance to neutralization by the NTD-specific neutralizing antibodies. This work
demonstrates that neutralizing antibodies targeting subdominant epitopes need to be
considered when investigating antigenic drift in emerging variants.

Introduction:
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of
COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family,
alongside severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Lu et al., 2020). The positive sense RNA
genome encodes four structural proteins; Spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and
nucleocapsid (N) (Jiang et al., 2020). The S glycoprotein is responsible for interaction with the
human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and subsequent virus-cell
membrane fusion and thus is the key target for neutralizing antibodies (Pinto et al., 2020). The
Spike glycoprotein assembles into homotrimers on the viral membrane, with each Spike
monomer encompassing two functional subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit contains the Nterminal domain (NTD) and the receptor binding domain (RBD). The RBD encompasses the
receptor binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts the ACE2 receptor. The S2 subunit,
containing the fusion peptide, two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2), the cytoplasmic tail and the
transmembrane domain, is crucial for viral membrane fusion (Yao et al., 2020).

Despite the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population, a rapid
understanding of the antibody response arising from infection has emerged (BeaudoinBussieres et al., 2020; Crawford et al., 2020; Dan et al., 2021; Muecksch et al., 2020; Okba
et al., 2020; Pickering et al., 2020; Prevost et al., 2020; Seow et al., 2020). The majority of
SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals have been shown to generate an antibody response 5-15
days post onset of symptoms (POS) that peaks after ~3-4 weeks and then starts to decline
(Crawford et al., 2020; Muecksch et al., 2020; Prevost et al., 2020; Seow et al., 2020). The
magnitude of the neutralizing antibody response, which is thought to be important for
protection from re-infection and/or disease, has been associated with disease severity.
Specifically, those with most severe disease typically develop the strongest antibody response
whereas those experiencing mild disease, or who are asymptomatic, can have lower levels of
neutralizing activity detectable in their sera (Guthmiller et al., 2021; Laing et al., 2020b; Legros

et al., 2021; Rees-Spear et al., 2021; Seow et al., 2020; Zohar et al., 2020). Antibodies
targeting RBD have been suggested to account for >90% of neutralizing activity in
convalescent sera (Greaney et al., 2020; Piccoli et al., 2020) and several neutralizing epitopes
on RBD that are targeted by highly potent monoclonal antibodies have been molecularly
characterized (Barnes et al., 2020; Brouwer et al., 2020; Piccoli et al., 2020; Pinto et al., 2020;
Rogers et al., 2020; Tortorici et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). Reports suggest
escape from RBD-mediated neutralization is occurring in variant strains that are emerging
globally, which include mutations within the RBD that have been postulated to enable escape
(Muecksch et al., 2020; Starr et al., 2021; Wimber et al., 2021). This highlights the need to
identify neutralizing antibodies that bind epitopes outside RBD and to understand the role
these antibodies play in protection from re-infection or following vaccination. Identification of
neutralizing epitopes beyond RBD is therefore important for the development of synergistic
antibody cocktails for immunotherapy and passive vaccination, and will also be critical for
evaluating the relevance of potential immune escape viral variants as they arise, for example
the recently identified B.1.1.7 (Rambaut et al., 2020). We therefore sought to isolate SARSCoV-2 neutralizing antibodies from three donors experiencing severe, mild or asymptomatic
COVID-19 using an un-cleaved, pre-fusion stabilized trimeric Spike glycoprotein as antigenbait to further characterize the neutralizing epitopes present on SARS-CoV-2 Spike.

Here, we isolated 107 mAbs across three donors of which 47 (43.9%) showed neutralizing
activity. The majority (72.3%, 34/47) of the neutralizing antibodies targeted the RBD and
formed four distinct competition groups. 21.3% (10/47) of neutralizing antibodies targeted the
NTD and formed two separate groups. One NTD group contained potent neutralizing
antibodies able to neutralize infectious virus at a similar potency to RBD-targeted neutralizing
antibodies. The second NTD group, although less potent, showed glycan-dependant
neutralization activity. NTD-specific neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) showed a dramatic
decrease in neutralization potency against the recently reported highly transmissible B.1.1.7
variant, whereas RBD-specific nAbs were either unaffected or showed lower decreases in

potency, indicating that neutralizing antibodies against epitopes outside RBD are important to
consider when investigating antigenic drift surveillance and identifying newly emerging SARSCoV-2 variants of concern.

Results
Ab responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in three donors with varied COVID-19
symptoms. We have previously studied antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Laing et al., 2020a; Seow et al., 2020). To compare the antibody response between different
disease severities at the monoclonal level, we selected three donors experiencing a range of
COVID-19 severity (Characterisation and Management of, 2020). P003 was hospitalized and
spent time in ICU, P054 was symptomatic but did not require hospitalization and P008 was
asymptomatic and SARS-CoV-2 infection was only identified through serology screening
(Laing et al., 2020a). Longitudinal plasma samples were used to measure binding and
neutralization titres (Figure 1A). As we and others have previously shown (Seow et al., 2020),
the highest neutralization titre was detected in the individual with most severe disease (ID50
9,181) and the lowest neutralization titre in the asymptomatic individual (ID50 820). The nAb
response declined during the convalescent period with neutralizing ID50 values reduced to 258
in P054 and 25 in P008 after 188- and 194-days post onset of symptoms respectively. Plasma
IgG, IgM and IgA binding to Spike and RBD were also measured using ELISA, and although
IgG to Spike and RBD remained detectable, a large decrease from peak binding was observed
(Figure 1A).

Antibodies generated following SARS-CoV-2 infection target RBD and other epitopes
on S1 and S. Next, we used antigen-specific B cell sorting to isolate mAbs specific for SARSCoV-2 Spike. PBMCs were available for sorting at days 20, 48, 61 POS from donors P003,
P054 and P008, respectively. We used an uncleaved Spike that was stabilised in the prefusion
conformation (GGGG substitution at furin cleavage site and 2P mutation (Wrapp et al., 2020))
as sorting bait to allow isolation and characterization of mAbs against the full range of

neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes. 2.39%, 2.14%, and 2.45% of CD19+IgG+ B cells
bound to Spike in donors P003, P008 and P054, respectively, compared to 0.25% for a preCOVID-19 healthy control sample (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure 1). Despite a low
ID50 of 76 for P008 at day 61 POS, Spike reactive IgG+ B cells were detected at a similar
frequency to P054 with an ID50 of 1,144. 150 Spike-reactive cells were sorted from donors
P003 and P008 and 120 cells from donor P054. The heavy and light chains were reverse
transcribed and amplified using nested PCR with gene specific primers. The purified PCR
products were ligated into heavy and light chain expression vectors using Gibson assembly
and the ligation products directly transfected into 293T cells (Rogers et al., 2020). Spikereactive mAbs were identified by measuring Spike binding and IgG expression of supernatants
using ELISA. The transformed Gibson products for Spike reactive mAbs were sequenced and
used for gene analysis (see Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 2). Small scale expression
of sequenced antibodies was used to determine specificity towards Spike, S1, NTD and RBD
in ELISA (Figure 2A). In total, 107 Spike-reactive mAbs were identified and sequenced, 24,
19 and 64 from donors P003, P054 and P008 respectively (Figure 2B). 38/107 (35.5%) of the
Spike reactive mAbs were RBD-specific, 35/107 (32.7%) were NTD-specific, and 1/107 (0.9%)
bound S1 only (Figure 2C). 33/107 (30.8%) mAbs only bound Spike suggesting these mAbs
are either specific for S2 or bind quaternary epitopes that span multiple subunits (Liu et al.,
2020). The distribution of mAb epitopes targeted differed between donors, with P003 mAbs
predominantly binding non-S1 epitopes (Figure 2D).

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity of small scale purified mAb or concentrated supernatant
was determined using an HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type-1) based virus particles,
pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Grehan et al., 2015; Thompson, 2020) and a HeLa
cell-line stably expressing the ACE2 receptor (Seow et al., 2020). 47/107 (43.9%) of cloned
mAbs had neutralizing activity, an observation which highlights the presence of exposed but
non-neutralizing epitopes on Spike, including RBD, that generate a strong antibody response.
34/37 (91.9%) of RBD-specific mAbs were neutralizing whereas only 10/35 (28.6%) of NTD6

specific, and 3/34 (8.8%) of the Non-S1 binding mAbs had neutralizing activity (Figure 2A
and 2C). Therefore, RBD was the dominant target for the neutralizing antibodies isolated in
this study consistent with prior literature (Piccoli et al., 2020).

Diversity in Ab gene usage. All Spike-reactive mAbs were sequenced and their heavy and
light germline gene usage, level of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and CDRH3 length
determined using the ImmunoGenetics (IMGT) database (Brochet et al., 2008). A diverse
range of heavy and light chain germline genes were utilized by mAbs isolated from the three
donors (Supplementary Figure 2A). Although an enrichment for certain germline genes was
observed (Supplemental Figure 2B), there was only one example of clonal expansion arising
from donor P008 (Supplementary Figure 2D). A comparison of VH gene usage compared to
that of naïve B cell repertoires (Briney et al., 2019) showed an enrichment in VH3-30 usage
and a de-enrichment in VH3-23 and to a lesser extent VH3-7 (Supplementary Figure 2C).
Despite the enrichment in VH3-30 gene usage, ten different light chains gene pairings were
observed, including both kappa and lambda genes (Supplementary Figure 2B). mAbs
encoded by the VH 3-66 and 3-53 germlines were frequently observed for RBD-specific mAbs
as previously described (Barnes et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2021; Robbiani et al., 2020; Yuan et
al., 2020a). A phylogenetic tree of heavy chains showed clustering of related sequences from
all three donors (Figure 3A).

Overall, low levels of SHM were observed in the VH and VL genes (mean of 1.9% and 1.4%,
respectively) which is expected following an acute viral infection. There was statistically higher
SHM in VH of mAbs from P008 (2.3%) and P054 (2.0%), which used PBMCs isolated at days
61 and 48 POS respectively, compared to P003 (0.8%) which used PBMC isolated at day 20
POS (Figure 3B). There was no difference in the level of SHM in the heavy or light chains
between RBD-specific, NTD-specific and non-S1 mAbs (Figure 3C) or between neutralizing
and non-neutralizing mAbs (Figure 3D). Comparison of the CDR3 length distribution with
representative naïve repertoires showed an enrichment in CDRH3 of lengths 21 and 22 in the

SARS-CoV-2 specific mAbs (Figure 3E). Overall, and similar to previously reported (Barnes
et al., 2020; Brouwer et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Pinto et al., 2020; Robbiani
et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Tortorici et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020), the repertoire of SARSCoV-2 specific mAbs was very diverse, did not differ greatly from that observed in
representative naïve repertoires and showed very little SHM.

Neutralizing activity of SARS-CoV-2 mAbs. Twelve non-neutralizing and 37 neutralizing
mAbs were selected for large scale expression/purification and further characterization. The
neutralization potency was measured against both pseudoviral particles and infectious virus
(PHE strain using Vero-E6 as target cells). IC50 values ranged from 1.2 - 660 ng/mL against
the pseudovirus particles and 2.3 - 488 ng/mL against infectious virus (Supplementary Table
S1).

RBD-specific mAb P008_108 is amongst the most potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs described
so far with an IC50 of 2.3 ng/mL against infectious virus (Andreano et al., 2020a). Although
IC50 values measured against pseudovirus correlated well with those measured against
infectious virus (r = 0.7694, p < 0.0001, Supplemental Figure S3A), IC50 values were typically
5-10 fold less potent against infectious virus as seen previously with patient sera (Seow et al.,
2020). Some S1/non-RBD nAbs that had shown weak neutralization (>10 µg/mL) against
pseudovirus were only able to neutralize infectious virus at very high concentrations (>50
µg/mL) or undetectable neutralization. In contrast, NTD-specific mAbs P008_056, P008_007
and P003_027 had ~10-fold higher potency against infectious virus (Supplemental Table S1
and Supplementary Figures 3C and 3D). In particular, P008_056 neutralized infectious virus
with an IC50 of 14 ng/mL making this one of the most potent NTD nAbs reported thus far
(McCallum et al., 2021). nAbs specific for the RBD generally displayed more potent
neutralization compared to those binding non-RBD epitopes (Figure 4B-C). Low neutralization
plateaus and shallow neutralization curves were observed for some mAbs (Liu et al., 2020)

(Supplementary Figures 3B and 3C) suggesting incomplete neutralization. These mAbs
were typically less potent and had higher IC50 values >1000 ng/mL. Seven of the non-S1
binding mAbs bound S2 in ELISA (Supplemental Table 1) but none showed neutralizing
activity.

Neutralizing antibodies form seven binding competition groups. To gain further insight
into epitopes targeted by the isolated mAbs, we performed competition Spike ELISAs between
27 IgG and F(ab)2’ fragments (generated through IdeS digestion of purified IgG). Seven
distinct competition groups were observed (Figure 4A). nAbs binding RBD could be separated
into four competition Groups. Group 1 nAbs competed with a previously described SARS-CoV
nAb CR3022 which binds an RBD site distal to the ACE2 receptor binding site (Yuan et al.,
2020b; Yuan et al., 2020c) (classified Class 4 by Barnes et al (Barnes et al., 2020)). Group 1
nAbs displayed limited neutralization potency, particularly against infectious virus
(Supplemental Table 1). Group 3 nAbs formed the largest and most potent competition group
(Figure 4B&C). It contained 57.8% (11/19) of RBD nAbs tested in the competition ELISA, and
included the most potent mAb P008_108 (IC50 2.3 ng/mL against infectious virus). mAbs in
this group were dominated (7/11) by the VH3-53 and VH3-66 germlines (Supplemental Table
1) and predominantly clustered together in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3A). A similar VH353/VH3-66 gene enrichment has been reported for mAbs that directly bind the ACE2 receptor
binding motif (RBM) on RBD (Barnes et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020a).
Group 2 contained a single nAb with a CDRH3 of 22 amino acids that competed with
antibodies in both Groups 1 and 3 suggesting an epitope overlapping these two competition
groups. Group 4 contained four RBD reactive mAbs that formed a distinct competition group
indicating a further distal RBD neutralizing epitope.

Non-RBD binding nAbs formed three competition groups. Group 5 contained three nAbs which
bound Spike, S1 and NTD and had limited neutralization potency (IC50 4.8 – 21.7 µg/mL and

25.3 – 48.8 µg/mL against pseudovirus and infectious virus, respectively). Group 6 contained
four nAbs which were all more potent against infectious virus compared to pseudovirus
(Figure 4B&C) and included P008_056 which neutralized infectious virus with an IC50
(14ng/mL) in line with the most potent RBD binding nAbs. Structural analysis revealed that
P008_056 binds NTD adjacent to the b-sandwich fold (Rosa et al., 2021). Group 7 contained
only one nAb, P008_060, which bound to Spike and not individual S1 or S2 domains
suggesting it may target a quaternary epitope spanning multiple domains, similar to 2-43 (Liu
et al., 2020).

mAbs inhibit Spike-ACE2 interaction to differing extents. To explore the potential
mechanism by which nAbs prevent infection of target cells, we measured the ability of nAbs
to prevent the interaction of Spike with the ACE2 receptor on HeLa cells by flow cytometry
(Figure 4D). Group 3 nAbs showed >99% inhibition of Spike binding to HeLa-ACE2 cells
suggesting that these nAbs directly target the ACE2 binding site on RBD. Overall, nAbs
displaying the highest competition with ACE2 binding typically had the highest neutralization
potency (Figure 4E). Similar to CR3022, Group 1 nAbs showed less complete competition
(88.2-95.1%) and Group 4 mAbs show only partial competition (43.1-82.2%) suggesting that
these nAbs can sterically inhibit the interaction of Spike with ACE2 without directly binding to
the RBM or cause conformational changes to Spike that limit ACE2 binding. NTD-binding and
Spike-specific nAbs (Groups 5, 6 and 7) also showed some partial competition (38.4-91.8%).
Although these nAbs do not compete with RBD nAbs, it is possible binding to Spike causes
conformational changes that prevent subsequent ACE2 binding or lock RBD in the “down”
conformation which occludes access to the ACE2 binding site (Liu et al., 2020). As might be
expected, S2-reactive mAbs and S1-reactive non-neutralizing mAbs showed negligible
competition with ACE2 binding. Overall, these results suggest that some antibodies described
here neutralize SARS-CoV-2 through mechanisms beyond direct receptor binding inhibition,

such as inhibiting membrane fusion (McCallum et al., 2021) or S1 shedding (Piccoli et al.,
2020), which need be investigated further.

Glycan heterogeneity influences neutralization potency. As mentioned above, some nAbs
displayed shallow neutralization curves that plateau before 100% neutralization against
pseudovirus and this was more typical for mAbs specific for NTD. Similar unusual
neutralization profiles have been observed for some HIV-1 bnAbs, in particular those that
accommodate and/or bind N-linked glycans on the HIV-1 Env surface, and are thought to arise
due to heterogeneity in glycosylation (Doores and Burton, 2010). This phenotype could be
rescued for some HIV-1 bnAbs by altering the composition of Env glycans by expressing virus
in the presence of glycosidase inhibitors such as kifunensine (that inhibits the ERmannosidase I enzyme leading to Man9GlcNAc2 glycans) and swainsonine (that inhibits the
Golgi-α-mannosidase II enzyme, leading to truncated complex-type glycans in addition to the
naturally occurring high-mannose glycans present).

As NTD is heavily glycosylated (Watanabe et al., 2020), we next investigated whether
changes in the glycan structures on Spike, through preparation of pseudovirus in the presence
of either kifunensine or swainsonine, could affect neutralization activity. RBD mAbs,
P008_015, P008_087, P008_090 and P008_108, were not impacted by alterations in Spike
glycan processing (Figure 5). However, NTD-specific Group 5 mAbs, P008_039, P008_051
and P008_052, and non-S1 Group 7 mAb, P008_060, showed enhanced neutralization
against pseudovirus prepared in the presence of swainsonine where glycan structures will be
smaller in size. No change in neutralization was observed against pseudovirus prepared with
kifunensine although lower infectivity was noted as previously reported (Yang et al., 2020).
These data suggest that glycan structures can affect nAb epitope recognition either through
modulating the conformation of Spike or altering the accessibility of nAb epitopes.

Cross-reactivity of nAbs with SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV Spike shares 73% sequence
homology with Spike of SARS-CoV-2 and 73% with RBD (Walls et al., 2020). To determine
whether isolated mAbs targeted epitopes shared between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV,
cross-neutralization against SARS-CoV was measured using the HIV-1 pseudovirus system
expressing full-length SARS-CoV Spike. Although neutralization was detected for several
mAbs, this was generally at a much-reduced potency (3- to 65-fold) compared to SARS-CoV2 neutralization (Supplemental Table 1). nAb CR3022, isolated following SARS-CoV
infection, has previously been reported to bind a conserved epitope between SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 (Yuan et al., 2020c). However, cross-neutralization was observed for only one
nAb in the CR3022 competition group (Group 1) and single nAbs from Groups 4 (RBD), 5
(NTD) and 7 (Spike only) suggesting nAbs within each competition group bind the same
footprint but differ in their molecular contacts. Interestingly, the sole mAb in Group 7, which
reacts only with Spike trimer and not individual subunits, showed a 7-fold more potent
neutralization against SARS-CoV compared to SARS-CoV-2. Binding of nAbs to SARS-CoV
Spike expressed on the surface of HEK 293T cells was detected for mAbs showing SARSCoV neutralizing activity but not by SARS-CoV non-neutralizing antibodies in the same
competition groups (Supplementary Figure 3E). However, S2-binding non-neutralizing
antibodies, although unable to neutralize SARS-CoV (Supplemental Table 1), bound to cell
surface expressed SARS-CoV Spike (Supplementary Figure 3F) indicating the presence of
a conserved, non-neutralizing S2 epitope. Whether the S2 mAbs can bind SARS-CoV-2
infected cells and recruit ADCC in vivo is not known (Li et al., 2020b). Overall, conserved
neutralizing epitopes shared between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are present on both RBD
and NTD.

Sensitivity to nAbs to newly emerging Spike variants. The SARS-CoV-2 D614G Spike
variant supplanted the ancestral virus in most areas worldwide early in the pandemic and
although the mutation has been reported to be more infectious through stabilization of the
RBD in the ‘up’ conformation, it has not been associated with neutralization escape (Li et al.,

2020a; Weissman et al., 2020; Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020). More recently the B.1.1.7 variant of
concern first reported in the UK, which contains an additional eight Spike mutations in NTD,
RBD and S2 (DH69/V70, DY144, N501Y, A570D, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H) (Rambaut
et al., 2020), has been associated with more efficient transmission within the UK and is now
the dominant variant in London and the South East of England (Rambaut et al., 2020). It is
not known whether these mutations have arisen stochastically, have been selected purely on
the basis of increased transmission, or whether the emergence of B.1.1.7 was in part driven
by the pressure of neutralizing antibodies in longer term infections in immunocompromised
patients undergoing passive immunotherapy (Kemp et al., 2020; Mccarthy et al., 2020). Nor
is it clear if it will lead to escape from the neutralizing antibodies generated in response to
SARS-CoV-2 infection in wave 1 and/or generated through vaccination. Initial reports have
suggested that the B.1.1.7 variant is sensitive to polyclonal sera from individuals infected with
early circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants (Rees-Spear et al., 2021).

We measured neutralization potency of nAbs from the seven competition groups, as well as
patient plasma from P008 and P054, against HIV-1 viral particles pseudotyped with SARSCoV-2 Spike bearing mutations i) D614G, ii) N501Y (part of the ACE2 receptor binding site
and associated with increased transmission), iii) D614G+DH69/V70 (H69 and V70 deletion in
NTD loop), and iv) the B.1.1.7 variant containing all eight Spike mutations. Similar to previous
data (Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020), the D614G mutation alone only showed a modest effect on
neutralization by the majority of RBD-specific nAbs or plasma from the P008 and P054 donors.
However, NTD-specific nAbs within competition group 5 showed a decrease (22-140 fold) in
neutralization potency against the D614G variant (Figure 6A and Supplemental Figure 4A)
and two group 4 RBD-specific nAbs, P008_087 and P008_038, showed a 4- and 15-fold
decrease in potency respectively and Group 1 RBD-specific nAb, P054_027, showed a 16fold reduction. N501 is part of the ACE2 receptor binding motif. Substitution to tyrosine has
been shown to increase affinity for ACE2 (Starr et al., 2021) and the N501Y mutation was

observed in a mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 variant (Gu et al., 2020). Despite the location of
the N501Y mutation in RBD, the vast majority of RBD specific nAbs were not affected by this
Spike mutation (Figure 6A and Supplemental Figure 4A). By contrast, group 3 nAbs
P003_017 and P008_003 showed a 15- and 6-fold decrease respectively, and group 1 nAb
P054_004 showed a 5-fold decrease in neutralization potency against the N501Y variant. No
change in neutralization was observed for NTD-specific group 5 and 6 mAbs against the
N501Y mutant. The DH69/V70 is situated within the N1 loop of NTD and, in addition to being
present in the B.1.1.7 variant, has been associated with viral evolution in an
immunocompromised SARS-CoV-2 infected individual undergoing convalescent plasma
therapy (Kemp et al., 2020). Deletion H69/V70 in combination with the D614G mutation had
a very limited effect on neutralization of RBD-specific or NTD-specific antibodies with only
P054_004 and P003_027 showing very small reductions (7-8 fold) compared to the D614G
variant (Figure 6B and Supplemental Figure 4B).

NTD nAbs in both group 5 and 6 showed a dramatic reduction in neutralization against the
B.1.1.7 variant (Figure 6B-D and Supplemental Figure 4B). Group 6 NTD-specific nAbs
(including P008_056, P008_007, P003_027 and P054_021) showed no detectable
neutralizing activity up to 100 µg/mL and group 5 NTD-specific nAbs showed a >200-fold
reduction in potency. The most potent mAbs in RBD groups 3 and 4 showed no reduction in
neutralization activity against the B.1.1.7 variant. In contrast, P008_081, P054_022 and
P008_047 (Group 3) and P008_096 and P008_087 (Group 4) showed a 4 – 38-fold reduction
against B.1.1.7 whilst maintaining IC50 values in the 0.013-15 µg/mL range. P003_017 was
the RBD nAb showing the greatest reduction in neutralization with only very weak
neutralization detected at 50 µg/mL. Despite the reduction in neutralization potency or loss of
neutralization activity for specific mAbs, neutralization potency of sera from P008 and P054 at
days 61 and 48 POS showed a minimal 2-fold and 8-fold reduction in potency against the

response overcomes the Spike mutations in the B.1.1.7 variant.

Discussion
Here we isolated SARS-CoV-2 Spike reactive neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies
from three convalescent donors who experienced a range of COVID-19 illness severities. As
observed previously (Barnes et al., 2020; Brouwer et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020; Liu et al.,
2020; Pinto et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Tortorici et al., 2020; Wu
et al., 2020), the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is very diverse, is not restricted to specific
germlines and does not require extensive somatic hypermutation for neutralization as seen
for HIV-1 nAbs (Doores et al., 2015; Scheid et al., 2009). Antibodies against RBD, NTD and
non-S1 epitopes were isolated from all three donors. The most potent neutralizing antibody,
P008_108 (IC50 2.3 ng/mL against infectious virus), was isolated from an asymptomatic donor
with very low serum neutralizing activity. Isolation of similar potent mAbs from donors with low
serum neutralizing activity has also been reported by Robbiani et al (Robbiani et al., 2020)
and suggests that the lower neutralization potency of sera from individuals experiencing mild
or no COVID-19 symptoms is due to a low quantity of plasma neutralizing antibody rather than
sub-optimal potency of individual antibodies. It also suggests that memory responses are not
proportional to the antibodies arising in serum after the immediate plasmablast burst. Upon
re-exposure, all individuals would be expected to produce highly potent neutralizing
antibodies.

The use of Spike for antigen-specific B cell sorting allowed us to isolate mAbs targeting
epitopes beyond the RBD and to study their relevance in viral evolution and antigenic changes
in Spike. Roughly one third of isolated mAbs were specific for NTD but only 28.5% of these
showed neutralizing activity. Neutralizing NTD mAbs formed two distinct competition groups
(Figure 4A). The most potent competition group (Group 6) contained nAbs that neutralized
infectious virus more potently than pseudovirus. Assuming the structural conformations and

dynamics of the Spike on pseudovirus and infectious virus are identical, the discordant
neutralization differences may relate to differences in Spike density, Spike glycan
heterogeneity or levels of the ACE2 receptor on the target cell lines used in the two assays.
nAb P008_056 neutralized infectious virus with an IC50 of 14 ng/mL making this one of the
most potent NTD nAbs reported (Rogers et al., 2020) and in line with the most potent RBD
nAb isolated here. Structural analysis of the interaction of P008_056 Fab with Spike revealed
that the antibody binds the viral glycoprotein at the distal face of the NTD, including dramatic
conformation changes in this domain (Rosa et al., 2021). The less potent NTD competition
group (Group 5) showed atypical neutralization curves. For these antibodies, neutralization
activity could be enhanced by reducing the size and/or composition of N-glycans on Spike
through preparation of pseudoviral particles in the presence of swainsonine (Figure 5). As
NTD is heavily glycosylated, a reduction in the glycan size will likely increase the accessibility
of protein epitopes on NTD (Watanabe et al., 2020) and thus enhance binding efficiency and
neutralization potency.

RBD-specific nAbs isolated here targeted epitopes similar to those reported previously
(Barnes et al., 2020; Brouwer et al., 2020; Piccoli et al., 2020; Seydoux et al., 2020; Yuan et
al., 2020b; Zost et al., 2020) and included nAbs that directly block ACE2 binding through
binding RBM and nAbs targeting epitopes distal to the RBM. We also isolated a high proportion
of Spike reactive mAbs which showed no neutralizing activity demonstrating the presence of
immunodominant, non-neutralizing epitopes on RBD, NTD and S2. 31.8% (34/107) of mAbs
did not bind suggesting S2 or quaternary epitopes, but only three showed neutralizing activity.
Although S2 reactive mAbs showed no neutralizing activity, they were able to cross-react with
SARS-CoV Spike expressed on the surface of cells. As the non-neutralizing mAbs are able to
bind cell-surface expressed Spike, it will be important to investigate whether they can facilitate
Fc effector functions such as ADCC and play a role in virus clearance (Bournazos et al., 2020;
Li et al., 2020b).

New SARS-CoV-2 variants are rapidly emerging across the globe and it is important to
determine whether antibodies generated during wave 1 infections or following vaccination will
provide protection against these new variants of concern (Rambaut et al., 2020). Despite the
dominant neutralizing antibody response being against RBD, we show that the B.1.1.7 variant
is still potently neutralized by some RBD-specific nAbs but is highly resistant to NTD-specific
nAbs. As the DH69/V70 deletion alone did not lead to neutralization resistance, it is likely the
DY144 deletion facilitates neutralization escape. Indeed, structural analysis of P008_056 in
complex with SARS-CoV-2 Spike shows that Y144 sits within a loop that must undergo
conformational rearrangement to allow access to the P008_056 epitope on NTD (Rosa et al.,
2021). It is not possible to conclude from our data whether nAbs against NTD are selecting
for Spike variants encoding NTD deletions, such as B.1.1.7, or whether NTD mutations alter
Spike functionality to favour increased transmissibility. More specifically, deletions in NTD
have been associated with neutralization escape from mAbs (Andreano et al., 2020b; Kemp
et al., 2020; Mccarthy et al., 2020; Wimber et al., 2021). The DY144 deletion, which has a
prevalence of 1.7% in 37 countries (McCallum et al., 2021), has been shown to abrogate
binding to other NTD mAbs including S2M28, S2X28, S2X333 and 4A8 (Chi et al., 2020;
McCallum et al., 2021). NTD deletions, including DH69/V70 (Kemp et al., 2020) and D141-144
(Avanzato et al., 2020; Choi et al., 2020; Mccarthy et al., 2020), have been observed in
immunocompromised individuals who remain infected for extended periods. And lastly,
deletion of NTD residues 242-244 from the B.1.351 variant (501Y.V2 prevalent in South Africa)
and has been shown to reduce binding by NTD specific mAbs 4A8 (Wimber et al., 2021) and
4-8 (P. et al., 2021). Thus, more research is needed to establish the driver for the observed
accumulation of genetic changes in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains.

Despite the loss in neutralization of NTD-specific nAbs against B.1.1.7, neutralization by RBDspecific nAbs either remained unchanged or, when a reduction was observed, neutralization
in the 0.001 – 5 µg/mL range was still measured for the majority of antibodies. The reduction

in RBD-specific mAbs neutralization against B.1.1.7 was of lower magnitude than that reported
for mAbs against the B.1.351 variant (Wimber et al., 2021). The B.1.351 variant also encodes
RBD mutations K417N and E484K which have been associated with viral escape from RBDtargeting antibodies (Starr et al., 2021; Weisblum et al., 2020). As RBD is the predominant
target for neutralizing antibodies following infection (Greaney et al., 2020; Piccoli et al., 2020),
this would suggest RBD-specific nAbs had a limited contribution to any immune escape
contributing to the selection of the B.1.1.7 variant. Importantly, although there was a 2- and 8fold decrease in P054 and P008 plasma neutralization, respectively, against the B.1.1.7
variant, neutralization could still be detected. This suggests that although complete loss of
neutralization is observed for specific mAbs, further mutations would be needed for complete
neutralization escape from the polyclonal antibody response generated from SARS-CoV-2
infection in these individuals.

In conclusion, we identified potent neutralizing antibodies targeting both RBD and NTD
neutralizing epitopes. We show that the B.1.1.7 variant is resistant to neutralization by the
NTD nAbs demonstrating the importance of considering both dominant and sub-dominant
neutralizing epitopes on Spike when studying viral evolution and antigenic drift.

Methods
Ethics statement. This study used samples collected as part of the COVID-IP study.(Laing
et al., 2020a) The study protocol for patient recruitment and sampling, out of the intensive care
setting, was approved by the committee of the Infectious Diseases Biobank of King’s College
London

with

reference

number

COV-250320.

The

protocol

for healthy volunteer recruitment and sampling was similarly approved by the same committee
as an amendment to an existing approval for healthy volunteer recruitment with reference
number MJ1-031218b. Both approvals were granted under the terms of the Infectious Disease
Biobank’s ethics permission (reference 19/SC/0232) granted by the South Central Hampshire
B Research Ethics Committee in 2019. Patient recruitment from the ICU was undertaken
through the ethics for the IMMERSE study approved by the South Central Berkshire Ethics
Committee with reference number 19/SC/0187. Patient and control samples and data were
anonymized at the point of sample collection by research nursing staff or clinicians involved
in the COVID-IP project. We complied with all relevant ethical regulations.

Protein expression and purification. Recombinant Spike and RBD for ELISA were
expressed and purified as previously described (Seow et al., 2020). Recombinant S1
(residues 1-530) and NTD (residues 1-310) expression and purification was described in Rosa
et al (Rosa et al., 2021). S2 protein was obtained from SinoBiological (Cat number: 40590V08B).

For antigen-specific B cell sorting, Spike glycoprotein consisted of the pre-fusion S
ectodomain (residues 1–1138) with a GGGG substitution at the furin cleavage site (amino
acids 682–685), proline substitutions at amino acid positions 986 and 987, and an N-terminal
T4 trimerization domain. Spike was cloned into a pHLsec vector containing Avi and 6xHis tags
(Aricescu et al., 2006). Biotinylated Spike was expressed in 1L of HEK293F cells (Invitrogen)
at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells ml−1. To achieve in-vivo biotinylation, 480µg of each plasmid was
co-transfected with 120µg of BirA and 12mg PEI-Max (Polysciences) in the presence of

200µM biotin (final concentration). The supernatant was harvested after 7 days and purified
using immobilized metal affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography.
Complete biotinylation was confirmed via depletion of proteins using avidin beads.

ELISA (S, RBD, NTD, S2 or S1). 96-well plates (Corning, 3690) were coated with S, S1, NTD,
S2 or RBD at 3μg/mL overnight at 4°C. The plates were washed (5 times with PBS/0.05%
Tween-20, PBS-T), blocked with blocking buffer (5% skimmed milk in PBS-T) for 1 h at room
temperature. Serial dilutions of serum, plasma, mAb or supernatant in blocking buffer were
added and incubated for 2 hr at room temperature. Plates were washed (5 times with PBS-T)
and secondary antibody was added and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. IgM was
detected using Goat-anti-human-IgM-HRP (horseradish peroxidase) (1:1,000) (Sigma:
A6907) and IgG was detected using Goat-anti-human-Fc-AP (alkaline phosphatase) (1:1,000)
(Jackson: 109-055-098). Plates were washed (5 times with PBS-T) and developed with either
AP substrate (Sigma) and read at 405 nm (AP) or 1-step TMB (3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine)
substrate (Thermo Scientific) and quenched with 0.5 M H2S04 before reading at 450 nm (HRP).

Fab/Fc ELISA. 96-well plates (Corning, 3690) were coated with goat anti-human Fc IgG
antibody at 3 µg/mL overnight at 4°C. The above protocol was followed. The presence of IgG
in supernatants was detected using Goat-anti-human-Fc-AP (alkaline phosphatase) (1:1,000)
(Jackson: 109-055-098).

IgG digestion to generate F(ab’)2. IgG were incubated with IdeS (4 µg of IdeS per 1 mg of
IgG) in PBS for 1 hour at 37 °C. The Fc and IdeS A were removed using a mix of Protein A
Sepharose® Fast Flow (250 µL per 1 mg digested mAb; GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and Ni
Sepharose™ 6 Fast Flow (50 µL per 1 mg digested mAb; GE Healthcare Life Sciences) which
were washed twice with PBS before adding to the reaction mixture. After exactly 10 minutes
the beads were removed from the F(ab’)2-dilution by filtration in Spin-X tube filters (Costar®)

and the filtrate was concentrated in Amicon® Ultra Filters (10k, Millipore). Purified F(ab’)2
fragments were analysed by SDS-PAGE.

F(ab’)2 and IgG competition ELISA. 96-well half area high bind microplates (Corning®) were
coated with S-protein at 3μg/mL in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed (5 times with
PBS/0.05% Tween-20, PBS-T) and blocked with 5% milk in PBS/T for 2 hr at room
temperature. Serial dilutions (5-fold) of F(ab’)2, starting at 100-molar excess of the IC80 of S
binding, were added to the plates and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Plates were
washed (5 times with PBS-T) before competing IgG was added at their IC80 of S binding and
incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. Plates were washed (5 times with PBS-T) and Goatanti-human-Fc-AP (alkaline phosphatase) (1:1,000) (Jackson: 109-055-098) was added and
incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature. The plates were washed (5 times with PBS-T)
and AP substrate (Sigma) was added. Optical density was measured at 405 nm in 5-minute
intervals. The percentage competition was calculated as the reduction in IgG binding in the
presence of F(ab’)2 (at 100-molar excess of the IC80) as a percentage of the maximum IgG
binding in the absence of F(ab’)2. Competition groups were determined using Ward2 clustering
(R, Complex Heatmap package (Gu et al., 2016)) for initial analysis and Groups were then
arranged by hand according to binding epitopes.

SARS-CoV-2 (wild-type and mutants) and SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus preparation.
Pseudotyped HIV virus incorporating the SARS-Cov-2 wild-type or mutants (D614G, N501Y,
D614G+Del69/70 and B.1.1.7) or SARS-CoV spike protein was produced in a 10 cm dish

stored at -80°C until required.

Viral entry inhibition assay with SARS-CoV-2 (wild-type and mutants) and SARS-CoV
pseudotyped virus. Neutralization assays were conducted as previously described (Carter
et al., 2020). Serial dilutions of serum samples (heat inactivated at 56°C for 30mins) or mAbs
were prepared with DMEM-C media and incubated with pseudotyped virus for 1-hour at 37°C
in 96-well plates. Next, HeLa cells stably expressing the ACE2 receptor (provided by Dr James
Voss, Scripps Research, La Jolla, CA) were added (12,500 cells/50µL per well) and the plates
were left for 72 hours. Infection level was assessed in lysed cells with the Bright-Glo luciferase
kit (Promega), using a Victor™ X3 multilabel reader (Perkin Elmer). Measurements were
performed in duplicate and duplicates used to calculate the ID50.

Infectious virus strain and propagation. Vero-E6 cells (Cercopithecus aethiops derived
epithelial kidney cells, provided by Prof Wendy Barclay, Imperial College London) cells were
grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with GlutaMAX,
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 20 µg/mL gentamicin, and incubated at 37oC with 5% CO2.
SARS-CoV-2 Strain England 2 (England 02/2020/407073) was obtained from Public Health
England. The virus was propagated by infecting 60-70% confluent Vero E6 cells in T75 flasks,
at an MOI of 0.005 in 3 ml of DMEM supplemented with GlutaMAX and 10% FBS. Cells were
incubated for 1 hr at 37oC before adding 15 ml of the same medium. Supernatant was
harvested 72h post-infection following visible cytopathic effect (CPE), and filtered through a
0.22 µm filter to eliminate debris, aliquoted and stored at -80C. The infectious virus titre was
determined by plaque assay using Vero E6 cells.

Infectious virus neutralization assay. Vero-E6 cells were seeded at a concentration of
20,000 cells/100uL per well in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Serial dilutions
of mAbs were prepared with DMEM media (2% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep) and incubated with

authentic SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour at 37°C. The media was removed from the pre-plated VeroE6 cells and the serum-virus mixtures were added to the Vero E6 cells and incubated at 37°C
for 24 h. The virus/serum mixture was aspirated, and each well was fixed with 150µL of 4%
formalin at room temperature for 30 min and then topped up to 300µL using PBS. The cells
were washed once with PBS and permeabilised with 0.1% Triton-X in PBS at room
temperature for 15 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS and blocked using 3% milk in
PBS at room temperature for 15 min. The blocking solution was removed and an N-specific
mAb (murinized-CR3009) was added at 2µg/mL (diluted using 1% milk in PBS) at room
temperature for 45 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS and horse-anti-mouse-IgGconjugated to HRP was added (1:2000 in 1% milk in PBS, Cell Signaling Technology, S7076)
at room temperature for 45 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS, developed using TMB
substrate for 30 min and quenched using 2M H2SO4 prior to reading at 450 nm. Measurements
were performed in duplicate.

Antigen-specific B cell sorting. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of cryopreserved
PBMCs was performed on a BD FACS Melody. Sorting baits (SARS-CoV-2 Spike) was precomplexes with the streptavidin flurophore at a 1:4 molar ratio prior to addition to cells. PBMCs
were stained with live/dead (fixable Aqua Dead, Thermofisher), anti-CD3-APC/Cy7
(Biolegend), anti-CD8-APC-Cy7 (Biolegend), anti-CD14-BV510 (Biolegend), anti-CD19PerCP-Cy5.5 (Biolegend), anti-IgM-PE (Biolegend), anti-IgD-Pacific Blue (Biolegend) and
anti-IgG-PeCy7 (BD) and Spike-Alexa488 (Thermofisher Scientific, S32354) and Spike-APC
(Thermofisher Scientific, S32362). Live CD3/CD8-CD14-CD19+IgM-IgD-IgG+Spike+Spike+
cells were sorted into individual wells containing RNase OUT (Invitrogen), First Strand
SuperScript III buffer, DTT and H2O (Invitrogen) and RNA was converted into cDNA
(SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase, Invitrogen) using random hexamers following the
manufacturer’s protocol.

Full-length antibody cloning and expression. The human Ab variable regions of heavy and
kappa/lambda chains were PCR amplified using previously described primers and PCR
conditions (Scheid et al., 2009; Tiller et al., 2008; von Boehmer et al., 2016). PCR products
were purified and cloned into human-IgG (Heavy, Kappa or Lambda) expression plasmids(von
Boehmer et al., 2016) using the Gibson Assembly Master Mix (NEB) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. Gibson assembly products were directly transfected into HEK-293T
cells and transformed under ampicillin selection. Ab supernatants were harvested 3 days after
transfection and IgG expression and Spike-reactivity determined using ELISA and
concentrated 30-times for use in neutralization assays. Ab variable regions of heavy-light
chain pairs that generated Spike reactive IgG were sequenced by Sanger sequencing.

IgG expression and purification. Ab heavy and light plasmids were co-transfected at a 1:1
ratio into HEK-293F cells (Thermofisher) using PEI Max 40K (1mg/mL, linear polyethylenimine
hydrochloride, Polysciences, Inc.) at a 3:1 ratio (PEI max:DNA). Ab supernatants were
harvested five days following transfection, filtered and purified using protein G affinity
chromatography following the manufacturer’s protocol (GE Healthcare).

Monoclonal antibody binding to Spike using flow cytometry. HEK293T cells were plated
in a 6-well plate (2x106 cells/well). Cells were transfected with 1 µg of plasmid encoding fulllength SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 full-length Spike and incubated for 48h at 37°C. Post
incubation cells were resuspended in PBS and plated in 96-well plates (1x105 cells/well).
Monoclonal antibodies were diluted in FACS buffer (1x PBS, 2% FBS, 1 mM EDTA) to 25
µg/mL and incubated with cells on ice for 1h. The plates were washed twice in FACS buffer
and stained with 50 μl/well of 1:200 dilution of PE-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG Fc
antibody (BioLegend) on ice in dark for 1h. After another two washes, stained cells were
analyzed using flow cytometry, and the binding data were generated by calculating the percent
(%) PE-positive cells using FlowJo 10 software.

ACE2 competition measured by flow cytometry. To prepare the fluorescent probe, 3.5
times molar excess of Streptavadin-PE (Thermofisher Scientific, S21388) was added to
biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 Spike on ice. Additions were staggered over 5 steps with 30 min
incubation times between each addition. Purified mAbs were mixed with PE conjugated
SARS-CoV-2 S in a molar ratio of 4:1 in FACS buffer (2% FBS in PBS) on ice for 1 h. HeLaACE2 and HeLa cells were washed once with PBS and detached using PBS containing 5mM
EDTA. Detached cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer. 0.5 million HeLa-ACE2
cells were added to each mAb-Spike complex and incubated on ice for 30 m. The cells were
washed with PBS and resuspended in 200 µL FACS buffer with 1 µL of LIVE/DEAD Fixable
Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen). HeLa and HeLa-ACE2 cells alone and with SARS-CoV2 Spike only were used as background and positive controls, respectively. The geometric
mean fluorescence for PE was measured from the gate of singlet and live cells. The ACE2
binding inhibition percentage was calculated with this equation: (Rogers et al., 2020)

Sequence analysis/tree generation. The heavy and light chain sequences of SARS-CoV-2
specific

mAbs

were

examined

using

IMGT/V-

QUEST(http://www.imgt.org/IMGT_vquest/vquest) to identify the germline usages, level of
SHM and CDR region lengths. To remove variation introduced through cloning using mixture
of forward primers, 5 amino acids or 15 nucleotides were trimmed from the start and end of
the translated variable genes. The sequences were aligned with Clustal W and clustered via
PhyML to produce maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees which were visualised and
annotated using FigTree. The Sankey plot was made in Tableau.

three convalescent donors. A) Heat map showing IgG expression level and binding to
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and the three subdomains S1, NTD and RBD. The figure reports
OD values (range 0-2.5) for undiluted supernatant from small scale transfection of verified
sequences of 107 cloned mAbs. Grey indicates binding not measured. Antigen binding was
considered positive when OD at 405 nm >0.3 after background was subtracted. Neutralization
activity was measured against pseudotyped virus using either small scale purified IgG or
concentrated supernatant. Antibodies were considered neutralizing if at least 50%
neutralization was reached at the highest concentration (5 µg/mL for purified mAb) or
concentrated supernatant (30 times concentrated). Grey squares indicate samples that were
not measured for the antigen. B) Bar graph showing frequency of neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies isolated from donors P003, P008 and P054. C) Bar graph showing

Figure 3: Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike specific monoclonal antibodies. A)
Phylogenetic tree generated through analysis of heavy chain amino acid sequences. The first
5 amino acids were excluded in this analysis due to the variability introduced with the primer
cocktail used during PCR. The sequences were aligned with Clustal W and clustered via
PhyML to produce maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees which were visualized and
annotated using FigTree. Branches are colour coded based on the donor each mAb was
isolated from (P003 – orange, P008 – blue, P054 – grey). Binding competition groups (1-7)
are labelled at the end of branches for those mAbs studies in competition analysis (Figure
4A). B) Level of somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the VH and VL genes for donors P003
(orange), P008 (blue) and P054 (grey). Differences between groups were determined using
Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparison test and p values <0.05 shown. Black lines represent the
mean SHM. C) Level of SHM for mAb targeting the RBD, NTD, S1 or non-S1 epitopes. No
statistical difference in SHM was observed between the four groups for VH or VL (KruskalWallis multiple comparison test). Black lines represent the mean SHM. D) Level of VH and VL
SHM for neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies. No statistical difference was observed
between the two groups (Mann-Whitney 2-sided U-test). Black lines represent the mean SHM.
E) Distribution of CDRH3 lengths for SARS-CoV-2 specific mAbs and representative naïve B
cell repertoire (Briney et al., 2019). Error bars represent the standard deviation between
donors used in the analysis (n = 3 for SARS-CoV-2 and n=10 for naïve repertoire). A bimodal
distribution of CDRH3 length is observed for SARS-CoV-2 Spike reactive mAbs.

Figure 4: Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing and non-neutralizing
antibodies. A) Inhibition of IgG binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike by F(ab)2’ fragments
(generated through IdeS digestion of purified IgG) was measured. Serial dilutions of F(ab’)2
(starting at 100-molar excess of the IC80 of Spike binding) were incubated for 1 hr before
washing and addition of competing IgG (added at the IC80 of Spike binding). The percentage
competition was calculated using the reduction in IgG binding in the presence of F(ab’)2 (at
100-molar excess of the IC80) as a percentage of the maximum IgG binding in the absence of
F(ab’)2. Competition groups were determined using Ward2 clustering for initial analysis and
clusters were then arranged by hand according to binding epitopes. Competition <25% is
white. Grey boxes indicate competition not tested. Neutralization potency (IC50) of mAbs
targeting either RBD, NTD or non-S1 and/or in competition groups 1-7 against B) pseudovirus
and C) infectious virus. D) Ability of neutralizing and non-neutralizing mAbs to inhibit the
interaction between cell surface ACE2 and soluble SARS-CoV-2 Spike. mAbs (at 600 nM)
were pre-incubated with fluorescently labelled Spike before addition to HeLa-ACE2 cells. The
percentage reduction in mean fluorescence intensity is reported. Bars are colour coded based
on competition group or Spike subdomain specificity if competition group was not determined.

Figure 5: Neutralization of Group 5 nAb enhanced by changes in Spike glycosylation.
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was expressed in the presence of glycosidase inhibitors
kifunensine or swainsonine. Neutralization potency of RBD and NTD nAbs against Spike
modified viruses was measured. Group 5 nAbs (P008_051, P008_052 and P008_039) and
Group 7 nAb (P008_060) showed an enhanced neutralization potency and more typical
shaped neutralization curve compared to Spike with wild-type glycans. In contrast, RBD
targeting nAbs (P008_015, P008_087, P008_108 and P008_090) had unchanged
neutralization.
