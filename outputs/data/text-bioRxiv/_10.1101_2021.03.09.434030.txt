ABSTRACT

22

The ongoing pandemic, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 has taken the world, and especially

23

the scientific community by storm. While vaccines are being introduced into the market, there is

24

also a pressing need to find potential drugs and therapeutic modules. Remdesivir is one of the

25

antivirals currently being used with a limited window of action. As more drugs are being vetted,

26

passive immunotherapy in the form of neutralizing antibodies can provide immediate action to

27

combat the increasing numbers of COVID-positive cases. Herein, we demonstrate that equines

28

hyper-immunized with chemically inactivated SARS-CoV-2 generate high titers of antibody with

29

a strong virus neutralizing potential. ELISA performed with pooled antisera displayed highest

30

immunoglobulin titer on 42 days post- immunization, at 1:51,200 dilutions. F(ab’)2

31

immunoglobulin fragments generated from the pools also showed very high, antigen-specific

32

affinity at 1:102,400 dilutions. Finally, in vitro virus neutralization assays confirmed that different

33

pools of F(ab’)2 fragments could successfully neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with titers well above

34

25,000, indicating the potential of this strategy in treating severe COVID-19 cases with high

35

titers. The F(ab’)2 was able to cross neutralize another SARS-CoV-2 strain, demonstrating its

36

efficacy against the emerging viral variants and the importance of this approach in our efforts of

37

eradication of COVID-19. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that virus-neutralizing

38

antibodies raised in equines can potentially be used as a treatment regimen in the form of

39

effective passive immunotherapy to combat COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

41

The ongoing pandemic COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2

42

(SARS-CoV-2) has caused over 115 million total infections with more than 2.5 million deaths

43

globally to date1. The severity and the scale of the pandemic have imposed an unprecedented

44

strain on human health and the global economy. Though several vaccines have been approved

45

for immunization, it would require years of continuous vaccination drive before we defeat the

46

disease2,3. Remdesivir is an antiviral drug used for treating COVID-19, though with limited

47

efficacy which can only shorten the period of hospitalization if administered at the early phase of

48

infection4. The long delay in vaccination programs coupled with the absence of effective drug

49

indicates that COVD-19 is far from being over5–7. The situation clearly calls for multiple

50

approaches in countering the viral spread.

51

Neutralizing antibody (nAb)-based passive immunotherapy has been used as an antiviral

52

therapy module against various intractable viral diseases8 by blocking the viral attachment and

53

entry into the host cell. In the pandemic setting, convalescent plasma from the recovered patient

54

has been used as an emergency treatment plan for the emerging virus infectious diseases9 and

55

congruously, it has been approved by USFDA in the COVID-19 too10. While convalescent

56

plasma is considered as a quick source of polyclonal nAb against the infectious agent, its scope

57

is limited due to the lack of abundant blood source, heterogeneous antibody titer, and possible

58

risks of transmission of blood-borne infections7,11. An alternative to convalescent plasma can be

59

the antisera with improved efficacy obtained from hyper-immunized large animals such as

60

equines as demonstrated against various infectious diseases and venoms12–14. Even though

61

equine-derived antisera offer great potential for passive immunotherapy, they carry the risk of

62

antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) and serum sickness15,16. To overcome this

63

limitation, the next-generation passive immunotherapy uses the F(ab’)2 fragment of antigen-

64

specific immunoglobulins, thus avoiding the risk of ADE by removing the Fc region of the

65

antibody17–19.

66

Based on the above background, we have developed equine SARS-CoV-2 specific

67

immunoglobulin fragment F(ab’)2 and evaluated its virus neutralization potential. In this process,

68

the SARS-CoV-2 cultures of Indian isolate were propagated and chemically inactivated before

69

immunizing equines for the evaluation of its immunogenicity and potency. The immunoglobulin

70

fragments F(ab’)2 were prepared from the hyper-immunized equines and their virus

71

neutralization potential was tested by microneutralization assay. The result of the study

72

indicates the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 specific F(ab’)2 fragments in the neutralization of the virus.

73

This strategy is reproducible, easily scalable and could be made available for the masses. This

74

approach of immunotherapy will considerably help in managing the global COVID-19 pandemic

75

scenario.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

77

Cell Culture: Vero (CCL-81) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM,

78

Gibco) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Hyclone) and 1 × Penicillin-Streptomycin

79

cocktail (Gibco). Cells were continuously passaged at 70-80% confluency and were maintained

80

in a humidified cell culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.

81

SARS-CoV-2 propagation, quantification, and infection: SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated

82

from COVID-19 patient sample. Briefly, viral transport media (VTM) with lower Ct values (<20)

83

for SARS-CoV-2 Envelop and RdRp genes by real-time qRT-PCR were identified for culturing.

84

100μL of the filter-sterilized VTM was added to Vero cell monolayer in 96 well plates. Fresh

85

media was supplemented three hrs post-infection (hpi) and the wells were observed daily for

86

cytopathic effect (CPE). After the appearance of CPE, the supernatants of the corresponding

87

wells were transferred to fresh monolayers of Vero cells and the culture was continued. The

88

supernatants were regularly monitored by real-time qRT-PCR for viral genes as an indicator for

89

viral replication. Two such isolates that established continuous replication were identified and

90

sequenced by next-generation sequencing. Their genomic sequences have been deposited to

91

the GISAID database

92

O2-P1/2020, and EPI_ISL_458046; virus ID- hCoV-19/India/TG-CCMB-L1021/2020). These

93

viral stocks were used for all the experiments in this study.

94

All viral cultures were maintained in serum-free media. Three days post-infection, the cell

95

culture supernatant was collected, centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C to remove all the

96

cell debris, and was stored at -80°C till further use. Infectious viral titers of the supernatants

97

were measured by plaque forming assay (PFU/mL). All infections for the experimental assay

98

were performed in serum-free media for two hrs at 37°C with the required amount of virus

99

calculated from the respective PFU values.

100

Real-time Quantification and Plaque forming assay: RNA was isolated using viral RNA

101

isolation kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL GmbH & Co. KG). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was

102

performed in Roche LightCycler 480 either using a commercial kit (LabGun™ COVID-19 RT-

103

PCR Kit; CV9032B) or following WHO guidelines using SuperScript™ III Platinum™ One-Step

104

qRT-PCR Kit (Thermo Fisher) and TaqMan probes against SARS-CoV-2 E- and RdRp (Eurofins

105

Scientific). Raw Ct values generated post analysis of qRT-PCR was used to score the

106

supernatants. For plaque assay, 0.35 million Vero cells were seeded in 6 well plates and serial

107

dilutions of virus supernatants (10-3 to 10-8) were used for infection in serum-free media. Two hrs

108

post-infection, cells were briefly washed with 1 × PBS to remove unbound virus and overlaid

109

with 1 × agarose overlay media (2 × DMEM, 5% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 2% LMA).

110

Plates were left undisturbed at 37°C with 5% CO2 in an incubator for 6-7 days. Later, 4%

111

formaldehyde in 1 × PBS was added onto the overlay media for fixation and incubated for 15-20

112

min at 37˚C. The overlay media along with formaldehyde were removed, the cells were washed

113

briefly with 1× PBS and then stained with crystal violet stain (1% crystal violet in ethanol was

114

used as the stock solution and 0.1% working solution was prepared in double distilled water).

115

The plates were washed, dried and the number of clear zones in the plate was counted to

116

determine the infectious titer as PFU/mL.

117

Virus Inactivation: The cell culture supernatant containing SARS-CoV-2 was inactivated using

118

beta propiolactone (BPL; HiMedia) at a ratio of 1:250 or 1:1000. After adding BPL to virus

119

supernatants, the mixture was incubated at 4°C for 16 hrs with constant stirring, followed by

120

four-hour incubation at 37°C to hydrolyze the remaining BPL in the solution. The inactivation of

121

the virus was measured by plaque assay or CPE for three consecutive rounds. The absence of

122

plaques or CPE in the lowest dilution confirmed the total inactivation. The BPL treated

123

supernatants were precipitated by ultracentrifugation and the antigenic integrity of the samples

124

was confirmed by immunoblotting.

125

Immunoblotting: Infected cell lysates and virus supernatants were separated on SDS-PAGE

126

gels to confirm the presence and integrity of viral proteins. All samples were lysed in a mild lysis

127

buffer (Tris-Cl, NaCl, NP40; protease and phosphatase inhibitors) and Laemmli loading dye was

128

added. Once the proteins were separated on the gels, they were transferred onto PVDF

129

membranes for 2 hours and subsequently blocked in 5% BSA. Blots were probed with

130

Nucleocapsid (1:8000) and Spike (1:2000) primary antibodies, and HRP-conjugated secondary

131

antibodies. Image processing was performed using ImageJ22 .

132

Equine immunization plan: Separate groups (lots) each comprising of equines were formed

133

and each lot was assigned a unique lot number. These unique numbers were used across the

134

entire study involving activities such as immunization, bleeding and plasmapheresis. The

135

immunization schedule comprised of primary immunization, during which period the animals

136

were sensitized with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen mixed with Freund’s complete

137

adjuvant (FCA) as adjuvant and administered for a single time. The subsequent booster

138

immunizations were administered with Freund’s incomplete adjuvant (FIA).

139

During the primary immunization, the animals were immunized on days 0, 15, 29, 35 and 45.

140

On day zero, the equines were immunized with 1mL of viral antigen suspension containing 1 ×

141

107 inactivated virus particles mixed with equal volumes of FCA. The subsequent booster doses

142

were prepared by mixing 0.5 mL of viral antigen (containing 1 × 107 inactivated virus particles)

143

with equal volume of FIA and administered periodically for boosting the immune response.

144

Plasma samples from the immunized animals were tested periodically to estimate the antibody

145

response against SARS-CoV-2 inactivated viral antigen. The highest dilutions of the plasma

146

samples necessary to bind with specificity to viral antigen coated in the micro-titer plate were

147

estimated by ELISA. Once the antibody response in the animals was saturated, they were bled

148

and blood volumes equivalent to 1.5% of the individual body weight were collected in glass

149

containers containing acid citrate dextrose solution (final concentration of 15% in the blood

150

volume) to prevent the coagulation. The supernatant plasma in each of the containers was

151

carefully collected and pooled for further studies.

152

Measurement of serum IgG level and their titer: Antigen-specific total IgG was measured by

153

indirect ELISA method. The whole viral antigen was coated in the 96 well plate (Nunc) using

154

bicarbonate coating buffer (pH=9.5) overnight at 4°C. The coated plates were washed with

155

washing buffer (0.05% Tween-20 in 1× PBS) and blocked with 4% skimmed milk solution for

156

two hrs at RT followed by three rounds of washing. Sera from control and test group were

157

added in the plate at 1:100 dilutions and incubated for two hrs at RT. Subsequently, the plate

158

was washed four times and incubated with HRP conjugated anti-horse whole IgG secondary

159

antibody (Sigma) for 1 hr at RT. After washing the plate five times, TMB substrate was added,

160

the reaction continued for about three minutes, and stopped by addition of 0.2N H2SO4.

161

Absorption maxima were recorded at 450nm and plotted on the XY axis graph.

162

In another set of experiment, IgG titer kinetics from 0 to 54 days post immunization were

163

calculated by similar ELISA method with slight modification. Here, sera from ten animals for

164

each time point were pooled in and serially diluted beginning from 1:100 to 1:204800 and added

165

into viral antigen coated ELISA plates while rest of the steps were the same as above. Similar

166

protocols were followed for the titration of F(ab’)2 fragments. Antibody titers were calculated by

167

the reciprocal value of highest dilution at which absorbance value is ≥ twice the value of

168

negative control in the same dilution series based on the earlier report23.

169

Virus Neutralization assay: Neutralization capacities of the antisera and F(ab’)2 were

170

measured by microneutralization assay in 96-well plates. For the initial standardization of the

171

optimal number of viruses required for CPE in 100% wells, cells were infected in a 96 well

172

format with the varying numbers of the virus particles. In all our neutralization studies, 300 virus

173

particles were used for infection. For neutralization of virus by equine antisera, 30000 cells were

174

seeded in each well of a 96 well plate 12 hrs before assay set up. 25 μL of serum-free media

175

containing 300 infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles were mixed with 25μL of antiserum: serum-free

176

media mix prepared separately. This mix contained antisera in 1:2, 1:4, 1:8 and up to 1:4096

177

parts of concentrations. The antisera: virus mixes were pre-incubated at 37°C for 1 hr before

178

infection. Subsequently, the wells containing cells were washed with 1× PBS and the mixes

179

were added to the corresponding wells. After the initial adsorption for 2 hrs at 37°C and 5%

180

CO2, the virus containing media was replaced with fresh serum-sufficient media and incubated

181

for six days. CPE developed in the wells were noted, media removed, and the remaining cells

182

were fixed with 100μL of 4% formaldehyde at 37° C for 20 minutes. Post-fixation, formaldehyde

183

was removed, wells were washed and the cells were stained with 0.1% trypan blue for 5

184

minutes to detect the live cells. The wells were observed against white light and scored for the

185

presence or absence of CPE and CCID 50 was calculated by a modified Reed and Muench

186

formula. The proportionate distance (PD) was first calculated using the formula (% positive

187

above 50%-50%)/(% positive above 50%- % positive below 50%). The PD obtained was

188

multiplied by the dilution below 50% and value obtained was added to the dilution below 50% to

189

reach the dilution of CCID50).

190

Preparation of F(ab’)2 immunoglobulin: Thirty liters of pooled plasma was subjected to

191

enzymatic hydrolysis of IgG using pepsin (2% w/v) for 2 hrs with the pH adjusted to 3.3. The

192

enzymatically treated plasma was subjected to complement inactivation by holding at a

193

temperature of 56°C for 30 minutes. Further, caprylic acid was added gradually to make a final

194

concentration of 5% v/v and mixed for one hour. Caprylic acid precipitates non-IgG proteins

195

keeping the F(ab’)2 in solution. The antibody fragment F(ab’)2 in the supernatant was diafiltered

196

and concentrated by ultra filtration through a 30 kDa cut-off membrane using 20 mM sodium

197

acetate buffer with 0.9% sodium chloride. The resultant purified concentrated bulk becomes the

198

key intermediate and tested for in vitro potency by ELISA and viral neutralization by the cell

199

culture method. The concentrated bulk was formulated and filled as a final injectable dosage

200

form, keeping the fill volume to 3 mL per vial. The finished product is intended for administration

through either intramuscular or intravenous route based on the severity of the viral load and the

202

urgency of the intervention. Immunization schedule along with the workflow is given in Figure 1.

203

RESULTS

204

Isolation of SARS-CoV-2 particles and establishment of virus culture

205

Out of several cultures established, two cultures were used for this study. The cultures

206

continued to demonstrate the presence of the virus in the supernatant as suggested by qRT-

207

PCR (data not shown). Plaque forming assay revealed high titers of infectious virus particles in

208

the order of 107 PFU/mL in these supernatants (data not shown). This culture was further

209

expanded to larger size and stored for subsequent studies. To verify the presence of SARS-

210

CoV-2, we analyzed the presence of virion proteins in the supernatants. Supernatants

211

containing infectious viral particles were precipitated by ultracentrifugation, lysed, and

212

subsequently subjected to immunoblotting. As demonstrated in Figure 2A, the spike (S) and

213

nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in the concentrated viral supernatants

214

confirming the presence of the virus. In parallel, immunoblot analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected

215

Vero cells detected the robust expression of S and N proteins, further confirming the

216

establishment of active SARS-CoV-2 cultures (Figure 2B). The viral genome sequences are

217

available at GISAID (hCoV-19/India/TG-CCMB-O2-P1/2020 [hereafter referred to as CCMB-

218

O2], GISAID accession- EPI_ISL_458075) and hCoV-19/India/TG-CCMB-L1021/2020 [referred

219

to as CCMB-L-1021], GISAID accession- EPI_ISL_458046). We then examined the inactivation

220

of the virus by β-propiolactone (BPL). We used either 1:250 or 1:1000 dilutions of BPL (v/v in

221

media) in this study, both of which displayed total inactivation of the virus. Detection of viral

222

proteins S and N confirmed the retention of the protein integrity of the inactivated viral stocks to

223

induce immune response in the equines (Figure 2C).

224

Antigen-specific immune response

225

As explained in the Methods section, the horses were injected with inactivated SARS-CoV-2

226

and blood samples were collected periodically. Plasma/sera prepared from individual animals

227

were subjected to ELISA to quantify IgG levels. Inactivated viral antigens induced strong IgG

228

response from 29th day onwards peaking at 42 days after priming and subsequently stabilizing

229

as shown in the Figure 3A. Notably, 80% of the immunized horses showed the seroconversion

230

from 29th day onwards except two animals which remained non-responsive during the entire

231

period of study (Figure 3B). The antibody titer which is indicative of quality of induced antibody

232

also enhanced from 29th day (1: 25600 dilution) as compared to the negative control, peaking at

233

42nd day post immunization (1:51200) and later retreating to 1: 25600 at 54th day as

234

demonstrated in the Figures 4 A and B.

235

Characterization of F(ab’)2 and measurement of their binding titer

236

Pepsin treatment of the purified IgG-generated F(ab’)2 fragments and the purified F(ab’)2

237

fraction showed the characteristic peak in the chromatogram (Figure 5A) with a typical band

238

visible around 110 kDa region in the non-reducing condition and 25 kDa in the reducing

239

condition (Figure 5B), demonstrating the purity of F(ab’)2 preparation. In the non-reducing and

240

reducing condition, F(ab’)2 typically shows single band at ~110kDa and 25 kDa position

241

respectively whereas whole immunoglobulin shows a single band at 150 kDa in non-reducing

242

condition and two bands at 75 kDa (heavy chain) and 25 kDa (light chain) positions under

243

reducing condition. This result confirms that immunoglobulin has been successfully converted

244

into F(ab’)2 fragments. Next, we measured the titer of the purified F(ab’)2. The purified F(ab’)2

245

samples showed a remarkable titer of 1:102400 as compared to the negative control (Figure 6) .

246

Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by antisera and purified F(ab’)2

247

Antisera from five individual animals were pooled and the virus neutralization capacity was

248

quantified by microneutralization assay. Sera from days 29, 42 and 54 were identified for

249

neutralization assay. The pooled sera were serially diluted at 1:2 ratio in serum-free media and

250

each dilution sample was incubated with Vero cells for infection. As demonstrated in Figure 7A,

251

the antisera from three independent time points displayed significantly higher neutralization

252

capacity over the control sera. Significant neutralization capacity was achieved 29 days post-

253

immunization and spiked at 42 days post-immunization (Figure 7A).

254

Next, we assayed the neutralization capacity of purified F(ab’)2 fragments from the antisera

255

samples. Here, three separate F(ab’)2 pooled batches of antisera were assayed for

256

neutralization. As demonstrated in Figure 7B the purified F(ab’)2 achieved significantly high

257

neutralization titers well above 25000. We also tested the neutralization capacity against

258

another strain CCMB-L-1021 that contained D614G mutation in its Spike protein. The antisera

259

generated against CCMB-O2 demonstrated reasonably high neutralization titer against CCMB-

260

L-1021 containing D614G, albeit lower than that against CCMB-O2, indicating the efficacy of

261

polyclonal antisera against other variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Figure 1).

262

Cross neutralizing ability of antisera reduces the risk burden of its therapeutic relevance against

263

emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, thereby suggesting that the equines purified F(ab’)2 based

264

passive immunotherapy hold enormous therapeutic potential against COVID19 in terms of cost,

265

safety, storage and mass availability.

266

DISCUSSION

267

Emerging and re-emerging zoonotic viral infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV

268

and MERS-CoV have become more frequent in the recent past due to the ever-increasing

269

encounters with wild animals and pose great threat to public health system. Despite great

270

advancement in the field of biotechnology and pharmaceutics, effective response against such

271

kind of pandemic is still lagging. Several vaccines have been at the threshold of being

272

introduced into the markets and they are reported to be quite effective while some of them have

273

been approved for emergency use

274

position in the fight against COVID-19 since vaccinating the entire human population would

275

require years of continuous vaccination. Several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have shown

276

their neutralization potential against SARS-CoV-2 25,26, but production of individual mAbs are

277

resource-exhaustive and also bear the risk of losing their potential against the possible mutants

3,24

. Nevertheless, antibody therapy still holds important

278

in the specific epitopes. Polyclonal antibodies generated in large animals such as equines have

279

the advantage of faster generation, requirement of relatively much smaller investment and

280

efficacy against multiple epitopes. Antisera generated from such sources had been a great

281

source of antiviral antibody to treat the various viral infection such as SARS-CoV, Ebola, MERS-

282

CoV and avian influenza virus27–30 . Clinical evidence of COVID-19 disease shows that latent

283

period of infection is short and majority of the patients recover faster without any persistent

284

infection thus increasing the prospects of using neutralizing antibodies in blocking the SARS-

285

CoV-2 virus particles31. Even though convalescent plasma from the recovered patients was

286

considered to be a great source of neutralizing antibodies32, the difficulty in recruiting such

287

individuals along with the lack of consistency in the neutralizing antibody titer among them has

288

posed major obstacles in utilizing its potential33. Moreover, several reports indicate the lack of

289

efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in improving the severity of COVID-19 34,35.

290

Notwithstanding the use of plasma therapy to treat various infectious viral disease such as

291

SARS, H5N1 and Ebola,28,36,37 it always carries a risk of blood-borne infection and its limited

292

availability hampers its prospect of universal application.

293

Considering the enormous potential of antibody based therapy, we developed a SARS-CoV-2

294

specific immunoglobulin fragments F(ab’)2 in equines using chemically inactivated virus as

295

similar to other reported work12,28. In the current study, we report the serum IgG titer to 1:51200

296

at 42 days’ post immunization, which is significant as compared to earlier report against the

297

SARS-CoV28. Another study demonstrated the potency of virus like particle (VLP) of MERS-CoV

298

in the equine 27 where they attained the antibody titer of 1: 20480. The higher antibody response

299

in this study might be due to the optimum antigen dose and immunization schedule.

300

The immunoglobulin fragment is normally developed by the proteolytic cleavage of

301

immunoglobulin that potentially negates the side effect of serum sickness and antibody

302

dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) as it no more binds to the Fc receptor of the

303

immune cells. Hence, it is suitable for usage at larger doses without any off-target concerns38.

304

F(ab’)2 that we generated achieved greater antigen specific antibody titer of 1: 102400 which is

305

comparatively better the earlier published reports

306

high antibody titer for F(ab’)2 generated from horses using receptor binding domain (RBD) of

307

spike protein18,19, but in vivo response still needs to examined before any conclusion.

308

Generation of inactivated virus was more direct and feasible approach for us than raising large

309

amounts of vaccine quality spike proteins to be used at commercial levels. Apart from the lesser

310

side effect, F(ab’)2 can penetrate deeper into the organs due to smaller size and lesser cellular

311

affinity therefore it can neutralize the virus in the extravascular tissue 39.

312

Virus neutralization by an antibody is the major goal of antiviral passive immunotherapy as the

313

effective antibody should neutralize the virus in vitro and in vivo setup at a significantly higher

314

dilution. At this front, F(ab’)2 generated in this study demonstrates robust in vitro virus

315

neutralization titer as high as 28000 which is comparable with other similar studies against the

316

SARS-CoV-218,19,28. Effective neutralization of a variant carrying mutation in spike protein by this

317

antisera demonstrates the broad efficacy in using purified antisera of equine origin.

318

Furthermore, the F(ab’)2 antibody shows very significant virus neutralization that is comparable

319

or higher than that the convalescent plasma therapy offers without the risk of blood born

320

disease40. The F(ab’)2 antibody developed from the whole virus antigen contains polyclonal

321

antibody against all possible antigens exposed, having a broader range of binding repertoire

322

thereby providing better anticipated scope of virus neutralization as compared to subunit

323

polyclonal antibody or monoclonal antibody.

324

The current study is based on the tested method for production of antigen specific antibody in

325

equines and is easy to scale up by industry with the domain expertise. The WHO guidelines are

326

already laid out for the production and application of antisera and their product from equine

327

source therefore it can be quickly available to the world for immediate application41. Strain-

328

specific antisera can be developed quickly based on the necessity. Hence F(ab’)2 antibody from

13

27,28

. Other recent reports also demonstrated

329

hyper-immunized equine serum could be a viable option for passive immunotherapy to treat the

330

COVID-19 and along with vaccines, can collectively bring down the burden of the pandemic.

331

Even in the optimistic scenario of active vaccines, passive immunotherapy can also be used to

332

save the life of terminally ill patients as it has been used to treat rabies.

333

Conclusion

334

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin F(ab’)2 prepared from the plasma of hyper-immunized

335

equines demonstrated high antibody titers and effective neutralization of the parental as well

336

emerging viral strains would be a reliable and efficient tool in the fight against COVID-19.

Fig.5. Characterization of purified F(ab’)2. A) HPLC chromatogram shows a dominant F(ab’)2

553

peak B) SDS-PAGE image of purified F(ab’)2 under reducing and non-reducing conditions. The

554

purified F(ab’)2 were loaded (5 or 10 µg) with and without beta-mercaptoethanol in SDS-

555

polyacrylamide gel and resolved under constant voltage. Reducing and non-reducing conditions

556

were achieved with and without beta-mercaptoethanol respectively. The result shows F(ab’)2

557

fragment of 28 kDa (two heavy chains and two light chains of almost similar molecular weight)

558

under reducing condition (left) and >110 kDa under non-reducing condition (right) demonstrating

559

the purity of F(ab’)2 preparation.

Fig.6. Antibody titration of the F(ab’)2 purified from the pooled plasma of immunized equine with

585

respect to pooled sample of negative control and titer is given in inset box. F(ab’)2 titer was

586

measured by direct ELISA method in which the whole virus antigen (approximately 1×105 virus

587

particles) coated-plates were incubated with serially diluted F(ab’)2 (1:100 to 1:204800 dilution)

588

for 2 hours at RT. HRP conjugated anti-F(ab’)2 secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) were added

589

subsequently and the color reaction was developed by adding TMB substrate. F(ab’)2 titer was

590

calculated by the reciprocal value of highest dilution at which absorbance value is ≥ twice the

591

value of negative control in the same dilution series.
