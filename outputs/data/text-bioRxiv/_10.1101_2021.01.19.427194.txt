Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells is initiated by the binding of the viral Spike protein to its cellsurface receptor ACE2. We conducted an unbiased CRISPRi screen to uncover druggable pathways
controlling Spike protein binding to human cells. We found that the protein BRD2 is an essential node
in the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. BRD2 is required for ACE2 transcription in human
lung epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes, and BRD2 inhibitors currently evaluated in clinical trials
potently block endogenous ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells. BRD2 also
controls transcription of several other genes induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the
interferon response, which in turn regulates ACE2 levels. It is possible that the previously reported
interaction between the viral E protein and BRD2 evolved to manipulate the transcriptional host
response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, our results pinpoint BRD2 as a potent and essential
regulator of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight the potential of BRD2 as a novel
therapeutic target for COVID-19.
Introduction
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency. As of January 2020, SARSCoV-2, the novel coronavirus causing this disease, has infected 95 million people worldwide, causing
at least two million deaths, and these numbers are rapidly increasing. There is still a major need to
elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with host cells. A more
detailed understanding will enable the development of therapeutics to treat and prevent COVID-19,
complementing ongoing vaccination efforts.
SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells is initiated by the interaction of the viral Spike protein
with its receptor on the cell surface, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). To uncover new
therapeutic targets targeting this step of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a focused CRISPRibased screen for modifiers of Spike binding to human cells. We expected that ACE2 and factors
regulating ACE2 expression would be major hit genes in this screen. A second motivation for
identifying regulators of ACE2 was the fact that ACE2 affects inflammatory responses and is itself
regulated in the context of inflammation1–3. Inflammatory signaling, in particular the type I interferon
response, is known to be misregulated in the most severely affected COVID-19 patients4–7. Therefore,
regulators of ACE2 expression would likely be relevant for COVID-19 in human patients, as suggested
by clinical data8.
Previous CRISPR screens were performed in cell-based models of SARS-CoV-2 infection that
overexpressed an ACE2 transgene9,10, represented cell types not primarily targeted by SARS-CoV-211,
or were non-human cells12. While these studies elucidated major features of SARS-CoV-2 biology, we
reasoned that the cell lines used would not have enabled the discovery of regulators of ACE2
expression in relevant human cell types.
Here, we selected a lung epithelial cancer cell line, Calu-3, which endogenously expresses
ACE2, to perform a targeted CRISPRi screen to find novel regulators of Spike protein binding. We
found that the strongest hit genes are potent regulators of ACE2 levels. Knockdown of these genes
reduced or increased ACE2 levels transcriptionally, and prevented or enhanced, respectively, SARSCoV-2 infection in cell culture. We identified the transcriptional regulator BRD2 as a major node for
host-SARS-CoV-2 interaction. BRD2 was necessary for ACE2 expression in Calu-3 cells, iPSCderived cardiomyocytes and primary human lung epithelial cells. Inhibition of BRD2 with small
molecules, some of which are in phase I clinical trials, completely abrogated SARS-CoV-2 infection in
cell culture. We found that BRD2 is a direct regulator of ACE2 and of a number of interferon-induced
genes that are upregulated during COVID infection. We propose BRD2 as a key regulator and
therapeutic target for COVID-19.

Results
CRISPRi Screen for determinants of Spike-RBD binding to human cells
To identify cellular mechanisms controlling the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to human cells, we
first aimed to identify a cell line that would robustly bind the viral spike protein (S). Our goal was to
use a cell line that would not require exogenous overexpression of an ACE2 transgene, because this
would prevent us from identifying mechanisms regulating endogenous ACE2 expression.
We measured binding of a previously described recombinant protein construct encompassing
the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor-binding domain with a C-terminal human IgG Fc-domain
fusion13, referred to hereafter as Spike-RBD, to several commonly used human cell lines (Fig. 1a and
Extended Data Fig. 1a). Only Calu-3 cells displayed a binding curve consistent with specific binding
of Spike-RBD, with an EC50 of 5.3 nM (95% CI: 3.5 – 8.1 nM). This value agrees with the dissociation
constant of Spike-RBD-ACE2 binding determined in vitro, 4.7 nM14, within measurement error.
Spike-RBD binding is dependent on ACE2 expression, as binding is completely abrogated in Calu-3
ACE2 knockout cells (Fig. 1b). Calu-3 cells are a particularly attractive model for studying SARSCoV-2, as they are derived from lung epithelia, which is selectively infected by SARS-CoV-2 in
patients15, are known to support infection of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-216 and have recently been
reported to closely recapitulate gene expression changes that occur in patients17.
We next generated a polyclonal Calu-3 line constitutively expressing machinery to enable
CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-based genetic screens18,19 and validated its CRISPRi activity (Fig. 1c
and Extended Data Fig. 1b). Using this line, we then performed a focused CRISPRi screen for factors
controlling Spike-RBD binding (Fig. 1d). In order to maximize our chances of identifying potential
novel therapeutic targets for COVID-19, we screened a sgRNA library targeting the “druggable
genome”, comprising ~2,300 genes, with ~16,000 total sgRNAs including non-targeting control
sgRNAs20. In parallel, we screened the same library using a fluorophore-conjugated antibody against
the transferrin receptor (TFRC, also known as CD71), to control for factors that generally affect
protein trafficking or protein binding to the cell surface (Fig. 1d-f).
As expected, ACE2 was the strongest hit knockdown of which decreased binding of SpikeRBD, while having no effect on TFRC levels (Fig. 1e,f). Conversely, RAB7A, which was recently
reported to be essential for the trafficking of TFRC to the cell surface21, was the strongest hit that
decreased TFRC levels, with no effect on Spike-RBD binding (Fig. 1f). Generally, hits were not
correlated between the two screens (Fig. 1f), demonstrating the specificity of each screen. While the
screens did not result in a large number of strong hits (Extended Data Table 1), we decided to validate
the top 15 genes knockdown of which decreased Spike-RBD binding and the top five genes
knockdown of which increased Spike-RBD binding. We cloned individual sgRNAs targeting each of
these genes and evaluated their effect on Spike-RBD binding (Fig. 1g). Based on these experiments,
we selected five hits that robustly recapitulated their phenotypes from the primary screen for further
characterization: two genes knockdown of which decreased Spike-RBD binding (ACE2 and BRD2),
and three genes knockdown of which increased Spike-RBD-binding (CDC7, COMP and TRRAP).
Hit genes modulate ACE2 levels and affect infection with SARS-CoV-2
Since ACE2 was the top hit gene knockdown of which decreased Spike-RBD binding in our
screen, we hypothesized that other hit genes might act by modulating ACE2 levels. Western Blots for
ACE2 levels in Calu-3 cell lines expressing sgRNAs against validated target genes (hereafter referred
to as knockdown lines) revealed marked changes in ACE2 protein levels. For hits associated with
lower levels of Spike-RBD binding in the primary screen, we observed lower levels of ACE2 protein,
and vice-versa for those hits associated with higher levels of Spike-RBD binding (Fig. 2a,b). To
distinguish whether hit genes affected ACE2 protein levels via transcriptional or post-transcriptional

mechanisms, we performed qPCR to measure ACE2 transcript levels in these same knockdown lines.
For all tested genes, we observed changes in ACE2 transcript levels that were concordant with the
changes in ACE2 protein levels (Fig. 2c), indicating that they acted on the transcriptional level. Some
genes, such as COMP and TRAPP, showed relatively modest effects on ACE2 transcript levels, but
quite large effects on ACE2 protein levels, suggesting that these hit genes additionally affect posttranscriptional regulation of ACE2 expression.
We next determined the effect of hit gene knockdown on susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2
infection. We infected cells expressing sgRNAs against hit genes with SARS-CoV-2 and measured
virus replication 24, 48 and 72 hours post-infection using RT-qPCR (Fig. 2d,e). Already at 24 hours
post-infection, viral genome copies diverged concordantly with changes in ACE2 levels and SpikeRBD binding: sgRNAs that lowered Spike-RBD binding reduced virus replication, while sgRNAs that
increased Spike-RBD binding resulted in higher virus replication. Remarkably, BRD2 knockdown
completely abrogated viral replication in these cells to similar levels as ACE2 knockdown, even at 72
hours post-infection.
BRD2 inhibitors prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells
Given the stringent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection achieved by BRD2 knockdown, we
decided to focus on this gene. BRD2 belongs to the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of
proteins, and is currently being evaluated as therapeutic target in cancer22,23, with several small
molecule inhibitors in clinical trials24.
We validated that CRISPRi knockdown of BRD2 robustly reduced BRD2 protein levels
(Extended Data Fig. 2a). Over-expression of full-length BRD2 restored ACE2 transcript levels (Fig.
3a), validating that the reduction in ACE2 expression triggered by CRISPRi targeting of BRD2 was
indeed due to BRD2 knockdown. Truncation mutants of BRD2 did not rescue ACE2 expression (Fig.
3a), indicating that full-length BRD2 is required for ACE2 expression.
To test the potential of BRD2 as a therapeutic target for COVID-19, we treated cells with a
panel of compounds targeting BRD2: two BET domain inhibitors, (JQ125 and ABBV-74426, which is
currently in clinical trials NCT03360006 and NCT04454658), and three Proteolysis Targeting
Chimeric (PROTAC) compounds that lead to the degradation of BRD2 (dBET-627, ARV-77128, and
BETd-26028). After only 24 hours of treatment with these drugs, Spike-RBD binding was already
decreased by at least two-fold. ACE2 mRNA levels measured by qPCR showed similar decreases (Fig.
3b). This effect was magnified after treatment for 72 hours, when almost no ACE2 mRNA was
detectable for any of the BRD2-targeting compounds tested, phenocopying BRD2 knockdown (Fig.
3b). Similarly, we found that BET inhibitors led to substantial decreases in ACE2 mRNA levels in
primary human bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. 3c) and human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3d),
two non-transformed cell types that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection29,30. Importantly, BET
inhibitors were non-toxic to Calu-3 cells and cardiomyocytes at effective concentrations (Extended
Data Fig. 3).
Since pharmacological inhibition of BRD2 phenocopied BRD2 knockdown, we hypothesized
that these same compounds might prevent infection of cells exposed to SARS-CoV2. To test this, we
treated Calu-3 cells for 72 hours with the BET inhibitors JQ-1 and ABBV-744, as BET inhibitors are
already in clinical trials, and measured SARS-CoV-2 replication at 48 hours post infection. Strikingly,
we found that treated cells displayed 100-fold decreased viral replication versus untreated cells (Fig.
3e), a similar effect size to BRD2 or ACE2 knockdown (Fig. 2d,e).
BRD2 regulates the transcription of ACE2 and other host genes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection
We next asked whether BRD2 controls transcription of additional genes beyond ACE2. We
performed RNA sequencing of Calu-3 cells after treatment with the BET-domain inhibitors JQ-1 and
ABBV-744 as well as BRD2 CRISPRi knockdown (Extended Data Table 2). We also included

CRISPRi knockdown of two other validated hit genes from our screen, COMP and ACE2. RNA-seq of
BRD2 knockdown and BET domain inhibitor treated cells recapitulated downregulation of ACE2 (Fig.
4a). Surprisingly, the same treatments also resulted in marked downregulation of genes involved in the
type I interferon response, while ACE2 knockdown slightly increased expression of those same genes
(Fig. 4a,b). Furthermore, the genes downregulated by both BRD2 knockdown and inhibition were
strongly enriched in genes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in patient and cultured cells (Fig. 4c).
These findings are compatible with two distinct mechanisms: BRD2 could be a direct
transcriptional regulator of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2-induced interferon response genes, or BRD2
could control interferon response genes, which in turn regulate ACE2 transcription. In support of the
latter mechanism, recent transcriptional studies of COVID-19 patients suggested that ACE2 expression
is induced by interferons1,2. Other studies, however, suggest that interferon suppresses ACE2
expression3.
We found that treatment with IFNβ, a type I interferon, strongly increased ACE2 mRNA levels
in primary human bronchial epithelial cells but reduced ACE2 mRNA levels in human iPSC-derived
cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4d), suggesting that the effect of interferons on ACE2 is context-dependent, and
BRD2 inhibition is likely to affect ACE2 transcription through mechanisms other than reduced
interferon gene expression.
To determine the pathway relationship between BRD2 and IFNβ in controlling ACE2
expression, we treated WT and BRD2 KD Calu-3 cells with IFNβ. IFNβ induced ACE2 expression in
Calu-3 cells but not in BRD2 KD cells (Fig. 4e). This finding is incompatible with a model in which
interferon response genes mediate ACE2 induction downstream of BRD2, and suggests that BRD2
might directly control ACE2 transcription.
To test if BRD2 is indeed a direct transcriptional regulator of ACE2, we performed
CUT&RUN31 to comprehensively map genomic loci bound by BRD2 in Calu-3 cells (Extended Data
Table 3). Genes adjacent to BRD2-bound sites detected in our experiment showed a highly significant
overlap with BRD2 sites previously mapped by ChIP-seq in NCI-H2332 cells, another lung epitheliumderived cancer cell line (Fig. 5a).
We performed Binding and Expression Target Analysis33 (BETA) to uncover direct BRD2
targets that were differentially expressed upon BRD2 knockdown, and identified ACE2 and several
interferon response genes as direct BRD2 targets (Fig. 5b). To validate our CUT&RUN results, we
verified that a previously described32 BRD2 binding side upstream of PVT1 was also detected in our
experiment (Fig. 5c). We also mapped a BRD2 binding site upstream of the interferon response gene
ISG15 (Fig. 5d), and within 10 kb upstream of the ACE2 transcription start site (Fig. 5e). These results
support a model in which BRD2 directly controls ACE2 transcription, as well as the transcription of
interferon response genes, which can in turn additionally induce ACE2 transcription in some cell types.
Discussion
Here, we demonstrate that BRD2 is necessary for ACE2 expression in cell lines representing
lung epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes, cell types most vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, and that BRD2
inhibition can block SARS-CoV-2 infection of the Calu-3 lung epithelial cell line. Our findings
suggest that pharmacological BRD2 inhibitors may be of therapeutic benefit to prevent or reduce the
impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection. One of the drugs we found to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in a
cell-based model, ABBV-744, is currently in Phase I clinical trials (NCT03360006 and
NCT04454658). Depending on its safety profile and side effects determined in those trials, ABBV-744
could be a candidate therapeutic for treatment after acute SARS-CoV-2 exposure.
We found that BRD2 is likely a direct transcriptional regulator of ACE2 in COVID-19-relevant
cell types. In Calu-3 cells, BRD2 is also a potent regulator of genes induced by SARS-CoV-2
infection, especially type I interferon response genes. In support of BRD2 as a direct regulator of both

ACE2 and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), BRD2 has been shown to directly bind to- and assist in
Histone H2A.Z removal from ISG promoters34. Taken together, this indicates that BRD2 could be a
key regulator of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The previously described35 interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 E protein and BRD2 might
have evolved to manipulate gene expression during infection, including the expression of ACE2. In
isolation, however, protein E overexpression in Calu-3 cells only partially recapitulated expression
changes resulting from BRD2 knockdown or inhibition (Fig 4a). These data suggest that the effect of
Protein E on BRD2 may be more nuanced, or that additional viral and/or host factors expressed during
SARS-CoV-2 infection are required to modulate BRD2 function. Further studies are needed to define
the function of the protein E-BRD2 interaction.
Several previous CRISPR screens aiming to uncover strategies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2
infection were carried out in cell lines in which an ACE2 transgene was overexpressed9,10; these
screens therefore failed to uncover BRD2 as a regulator of endogenous ACE2 expression. BRD2 did
show a phenotype, however, in a CRISPR screen carried out in Vero-E6 cells (which express ACE2
endogenously)12, although it was not further characterized in that study. Based on the observation that
BRD2 physically interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 protein E, BET inhibitors JQ-1 and ABBV-744 were
tested for their effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero-E6 cells35, but not found to be effective.
Here, we found them to be potent restrictors of SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells. Together,
these differences highlight the importance of investigating SARS-CoV-2 interactions with diseaserelevant cell types.
There is a growing literature about the relationship between COVID-19 disease severity, ACE2
expression, and interferon regulation1–6. Since ACE2 is known to promote recovery after lung injury
and that SARS-CoV-2 manipulates the host interferon response36–38, the mis-regulation of these two
pathways may play a major role in enhancing the severity of COVID-19. Our data suggest that BRD2
is central to this regulatory network and, therefore, pharmacological targeting of BRD2 may be a
promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of COVID-19: BRD2 inhibition could both block viral
entry, through ACE2 downregulation, and act as an “emergency-brake” for mis-regulated patient
immune responses to COVID-19, via down-regulation of ISGs.

Human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes were generated and cultured as previously described29,
from AICS90 iPSCs (Allen Institute Cell Catalog). Drugs were added on day 69 of differentiation, and
cardiomyocytes were harvested for analysis on day 72.
Normal human bronchial epithelia (Mattek NHBE-CRY) were cultured following the supplier's
instructions.
Generation of the Calu-3 ACE2 knockout line
The polyclonal ACE2 knockout Calu-3 cell line was generated using the Gene KO kit V2 from
Synthego, using three sgRNAs targeting ACE2 with the following protospacer sequences sRNA1: 5’GACAUUCUCUUCAGUAAUAU-3’, sgRNA2: 5’-AAACUUGUCCAAAAAUGUCU-3’ and
sgRNA3: 5’-UUACAGCAACAAGGCUGAGA-3’. Single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed
according to Synthego’s multiguide gene knockout kit40. Briefly, two or three sgRNAs are
bioinformatically designed to work in a cooperative manner to generate small, knockout causing,
fragment deletions in early exons. These fragment deletions are larger than standard indels generated
from single guides. The genomic repair patterns from a multiguide approach are highly predictable on
the basis of the guide spacing and design constraints to limit off-targets, resulting in a higher
probability protein knockout phenotype.
The ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with a ratio of 4.5 to 1 between sgRNA and Cas9 was
delivered following the protocol of the SE Cell Line 4D-NucleofectorTM X Kit (Lonza, V4XC-1012),
using the nucleofection program DS-130 on the Lonza 4D X unit. 72 hours post transfection, genomic
DNA was extracted to serve as the template for PCR amplification of the region that covers the sites
targeted by the sgRNAs with the following two primers: ACE2-F: 5’CTGGGACTCCAAAATCAGGGA-3’ and ACE2-R: 5’-CGCCCAACCCAAGTTCAAAG-3’. Sanger
sequencing reactions using the sequencing primer ACE2-seq: 5’CAAAATCAGGGATATGGAGGCAAACATC-3’ were then performed, and the knockout efficiency
was determined to be 80% via ICE software from Synthego41 (https://ice.synthego.com/#/).
Generation of the Calu-3 CRISPRi line
The parental Calu-3 line was obtained from the UCSF Cell and Genome Engineering Core.
Calu-3 cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in EMEM media containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml
streptomycin, 100 µg/ml penicillin, and 2 mM glutamine. To generate the CRISPRi lines, ~3x106 cells
were seeded into media containing lentiviral particles packaging dCas9-BFP-KRAB under a UCOESFFV promoter42. Five days post infection, BFP-positive cells were sorted using a BD Fusion. To
validate the CRISPRi line, Calu-3-CRISPRi cells were transduced with lentiviral particles expressing
non-targeting sgRNA (protospacer 5’-GCTCCCAGTCGGCACCACAG-3’) or CD81-targeting sgRNA
(protospacer 5’-GGCCTGGCAGGATGCGCGG-3’). CD81 expression was measured 7 days posttransduction by dislodging cells with TrypLE and live cells were stained with APC-conjugated antihuman CD81 antibody (Biolegend 349509). CD81 expression was assessed on a BD LSRII with >90%
of Calu3-CRISPRi cells with CD81 knocked down compared to a non-targeting sgRNA control.
Spike-RBD binding assay
Recombinant biotinylated SARS-CoV2 spike Spike-receptor-binding domain with a C-terminal
human IgG Fc domain fusion (referred to as Spike-RBD) was prepared as previously described43.
Calu-3 cells were grown in 96-well flat bottom plates until >50% confluent. Media was aspirated and
cells were washed once with PBS. Cells were then treated with TrypLE to release them from the plate,
RPMI 1640 media was added to dilute TrypLE, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 200xg for
five minutes. From this point on, all steps were carried out on ice. Cells were incubated in 3% BSA
(Sigma Aldrich A7030) in DPBS (Sigma-Aldrich D8537) for 15 minutes to block and washed twice in
3% BSA in DPBS by centrifugation at 200xg for five minutes in v-bottom plates, followed by

PE-Cy7 signal was calculated for each sample. The gating strategy is shown in Supplemental Figure 2.
EC50 values and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated by fitting the RBD binding data into a
Sigmoidal, 4PL model in Prism 6.
CRISPRi Screen
Calu-3 cells were infected with the H1 CRISPRi sgRNA library20 as described39 and selected
using treatment with 1 µg/mL puromycin for 3 days. After selection, cells were stained with 10 nM
Spike-RBD as described above or for TFRC as previously described39 and subjected to FACS, where
cells were sorted into top 30% and bottom 30% based on high and low expression of TFRC or SpikeRBD. Sorted populations were spun down at 200xg for five minutes and genomic DNA was isolated as
described39. sgRNA cassettes were amplified by PCR and sequencing and analysis was performed as
described39 but with an FDR of 0.1.
Validation of screening hits
Individual sgRNAs were selected based on phenotypes in the primary screens and cloned into a
lentiviral expression vector as described39. Protospacer sequences of these sgRNAs are provided in
Extended Data Table 4. Cells expressing sgRNAs were selected using treatment with 1 µg/mL
puromycin for 3-7 days.
Drug treatments
Drugs (ABBV-744 Selleckchem S8723, JQ1 - Sigma Aldrich SML1524, dBET6 - Selleckchem
S8762) were dissolved in DMSO or water as per manufacturer's instructions. Cells were treated with
drugs for 72 hours with media changes performed every 24 hours with media containing fresh drug.
Interferon Treatments
Interferon Beta (R&D systems 8499-IF) was dissolved per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells were treated with IFNβ for 72 hours with media changes performed every 24 hours with media
containing fresh IFNβ.
qPCR

qPCR was performed and analyzed as described39. Primers: ACE2 forward:
GGTCTTCTGTCACCCGATTT; ACE2 reverse: CATCCACCTCCACTTCTCTAAC; ACTB forward:
ACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCG; ACTB reverse: CCTGGATAGCAACGTACATGG
Western Blotting
Cells from one confluent well of a six-well plate were lysed in RIPA buffer plus c0mplete
EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche 11873580001) and spun for 10 minutes at 21,000xg at
4ºC. The pellet was removed and a BCA assay (Thermofisher 23225) was performed on the remaining
supernatant. Lysate volumes with equivalent protein content were diluted with SDS-PAGE loading dye
and subjected to gel electrophoresis on 4-12% BisTris SDS-PAGE gels (Life Technologies NP0322) .
Gels were then transferred and blocked in 5% NFDM for 1 hour at RT. Antibodies in fresh 5% NFDM
were added (Mouse monoclonal GAPDH 1:10,000; Goat polyclonal ACE2 [R&D Tech AF933] 1:200;
Rabbit monoclonal BRD2 [abcam 197865] 1:5,000) and incubated at 4 ºC for at least 16 hours.
Membranes were washed 4x with TBS + 0.1% Tween-20 and incubated with secondary antibodies

Virus
The SARS-CoV-2 strain used (BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 strain) was propagated once in
Vero-E6 cells and is a kind gift from the National Reference Centre for Respiratory Viruses at Institut
Pasteur, Paris, originally supplied through the European Virus Archive goes Global platform.
Cytotoxicity measurements of Calu3 cells
30,000 Calu-3 cells per well were seeded into Greiner 96-well white bottom plates and
incubated for 48 hours at 37°C, 5% CO2. Then, cells were treated with identical drug concentrations as
in the infection assays for 5 days by refreshing the media with 100µL per well fresh drug-containing
media every 24 hours. Cell viability was then assayed by adding 100µL per well of CellTiter-Glo 2.0
(Promega) and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. Luminescence was recorded with an
Infinite 200 Pro plate reader (Tecan) using an integration time of 1s.
Virus infection assays
30,000 Calu-3 cells per well were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated for 48 hours at
37°C, 5% CO2. At the time of infection, the media was replaced with virus inoculum (MOI 0.1
PFU/cell) and incubated for one hour at 37°C, 5% CO2. Following the one-hour adsorption period, the
inoculum was removed, replaced with fresh media, and cells incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2. 24h, 48h and
72h post infection, the cell culture supernatant was harvested, and viral load assessed by RT-qPCR as
described previously35. Briefly, the cell culture supernatant was collected, heat inactivated at 95°C for
5 minutes and used for RT-qPCR analysis. SARS-CoV-2 specific primers targeting the N gene region:
5 -TAATCAGACAAGGAACTGATTA-3 (Forward) and 5 -CGAAGGTGTGACTTCCATG-3
(Reverse) were used with the Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (New England Biolabs) in an
Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 6 thermocycler or an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus system, with
the following cycling conditions: 55°C for 10 min, 95°C for 1 minute, and 40 cycles of 95°C for 10
seconds, followed by 60°C for 1 minute. The number of viral genomes is expressed as PFU
equivalents/mL, and was calculated by performing a standard curve with RNA derived from a viral
stock with a known viral titer.

CUT&RUN
CUT&RUN was performed with 1 million Calu-3 cells. Cells were removed from the plate by
treatment with Versene (Life Technologies 15040066) for 20 minutes and resuspended in fresh media.
They were spun down and washed twice with DPBS before proceeding with the CUTANA CUT&RUN
kit (Epicypher 14-0050). The experiment was performed with the included IgG and H3K4Me control
antibodies and the BRD2 antibody (abcam 197865) as well as E.coli spike-in DNA according to the kit
protocol.
QuantSeq analysis
Raw sequencing reads from QuantSeq were trimmed using Trimmomatic44 (v0.39, PMID:
24695404) and mapped to the human reference transcriptome (GRCh38, GENCODE Release 36)
using Salmon45 (v1.3.0) to obtain transcript abundance counts. Gene-level count estimates were
obtained using tximport46 (v1.18.0) with default settings. Subsequently, differential gene-expression
analyses were performed using the glmQLFTest method implemented in the edgeR
package47(v3.28.1). Cluster48 (v3.0) was used for hierarchical clustering and Java TreeView49
(v1.1.6r4) for visualization.

CUT&RUN analysis
CUT&RUN analysis was performed as previously described50. Briefly, paired-end reads were
mapped to the human genome GRCh38 using Bowtie2 (v2.3.4.1) with options: --end-to-end --verysensitive --no-unal --no-mixed --no-discordant --phred33 -I 10 -X 1000. Sparse Enrichment Analysis
for CUT&RUN (SEACR51, https://seacr.fredhutch.org/) was used for peak calling. H3K4me3 and
BRD2 peaks were normalized to IgG control. Published BRD2 ChIP-seq data in human lung cells was
obtained from ChIP-Atlas (https://chip-atlas.org/). The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV, igv.org)
was used for visualization.

Figure 4: BRD2 controls genes induced by interferon and SARS-CoV-2 infection
a, Differentially expressed genes from RNA sequencing of Calu-3 cells under different treatment
conditions compared to control cells: 72-hour treatment with 10 µM JQ1 or 10 µM ABBV-744, BRD2
knockdown (KD), SARS-CoV-2 protein E overexpression (OE), COMP KO, ACE2 KD. Heatmap
showing log2-fold change (log2FC) for each condition relative to untreated controls (columns) for
genes that are among top 50 differentially expressed genes (ranked by P values) in at least one of the
conditions (rows). ACE2 was not among these genes and is shown as a separate row. Insert, a cluster
of genes that are down-regulated in both BRD2 inhibition by JQ1 and ABBV-744 and BRD2
knockdown. Among these, genes associated with the GO term “Cellular Response to Type I
interferon” are marked by black dots. b, Significantly enriched (FDR < 0.05) GO biological process
terms for the genes shown in the inset in (a). c, Enrichment analysis for genes in the inset in (a) reveals
COVID-19 related gene sets. Genes that appear in a gene set are marked in blue.
d, Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (left) and human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (right)
were treated with the indicated concentrations of interferon-beta (IFNβ), and transcript levels of ACE2
relative to ACTB (for Calu-3 and NHBE) or 18S rRNA (cardiomyocytes) were quantified at 72 hours
post-treatment by qPCR. Average and standard deviation of 3 technical replicates are shown for each
condition. e, WT (dark grey) or BRD2 knockdown (light grey) Calu-3 cells were treated with the
indicated concentrations of interferon-beta (IFNβ), and transcript levels of ACE2 relative to ACTB
were quantified at 72 hours post-treatment by qPCR. Average and standard deviation of 3 technical
replicates are shown for each condition.

Figure 5: BRD2 directly regulates transcription of ACE2 and interferon-induced genes
a, Genes associated with BRD2 CUT&RUN peaks within 10kb of a transcription start site determined
in this study in Calu-3 cells overlap significantly with published BRD2 ChIP-seq peaks from the
indicated datasets (P < 0.0001, Fisher’s exact test). b, Binding and Expression Target Analysis (BETA)
was performed to identify direct BRD2 targets that were differentially expressed upon BRD2
knockdown. ACE2 and several interferon response genes were identified as direct BRD2 targets.
c, CUT&RUN recapitulates known BRD2 regulatory sites. Raw signal tracks for IgG, H3K4me3 and
BRD2 are shown. Previously reported H3K4me3 CHIP-seq tracks as well as BRD2 CHIP-seq tracks
from human lung cells are shown. BRD2 peaks were called over IgG using SEACR at FDR < 0.05.
d, A BRD2 CUT&RUN peak was identified upstream of the interferon-induced gene ISG15. Raw
signal tracks for IgG, H3K4me3 and BRD2 are shown. BRD2 peaks were called over IgG using
SEACR at FDR < 0.05. BRD2 CHIP-seq tracks from human lung cells are also shown.
e, A BRD2 CUT&RUN peak was identified within 10 kb upstream of ACE2. Raw signal tracks for
IgG, H3K4me3 and BRD2 are shown. BRD2 peaks were called over IgG using SEACR at FDR <
0.05.
