ABSTRACT AND KEYWORD PAGE

ABSTRACT:
Career and professional development competencies are critical for biomedical PhD and postdoctoral training. In the
current educational landscape, programs that meet these competencies are offered and attended in an ad hoc manner.
During the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying switch to virtual learning, our team observed a surge in
interest for our weekly non-sequential programs. In this study, we surveyed our learners to better understand
motivators for attending these programs during the pandemic and to identify barriers for participating in such events
before and during Work-From-Home. Our data indicate that conflict with research responsibilities, time spent to get
to the event location, and planning time to attend are all significant barriers to engagement. Notably, feelings of
being overwhelmed, which increased slightly during the pandemic, stood out as an identified barrier. Per our results,
the virtual format was an attraction. While 58% of respondents would prefer to access professional development
programs virtually in the future, almost 42% indicated a preference for in-person events when normalcy resumes as
the physical presence of an instructor and of peers result in a deeper engagement. Our collective analysis here
suggests that learners will benefit from a hybrid or combination of synchronous and asynchronous career and
professional development programming in the future, even post-pandemic, to reduce identified barriers. Alongside
hybrid learning engagements, we strongly recommend structured time for learners to enhance their professional
competencies, enabled by a commitment from departments and faculty mentors to enable equity in professional skill
building and fostering lifelong growth mindset.

INTRODUCTION:

Our team supports the Career and Professional Development (CPD) of the ~1200 graduate and postdoctoral learners
at the University of Michigan (UM) Medical School. We provide a variety of programs ranging from weekly
workshops and seminars to structured, time-limited, and cohort-based programs. These evidence-based programs,
which follow published recommendations (1–4), are aimed at driving professional, academic, and career success in
the biomedical sciences and cover a gamut of topics including career exploration, transferable skill building, job
application best practices, and portfolio building. While our programs are extra-curricular and not required to meet
degree requirements, participating learners find significant value in them as reported in our 2019 Annual
Highlights.

Most universities across the USA shut down in March 2020 due to the rapidly increasing COVID-19 cases.
Leadership units at research-intensive universities focused on two main items: a) pivoting credit-bearing curricular
courses to online formats with some structural support (example communication from UM President for Spring and
Summer courses going remote) and b) developing and implementing procedures for prioritizing critical research
activities and enabling a rapid research ramp-down (5). Beyond the early years of PhD training, there is seldom any
requirement for course-based learning for PhD and postdoctoral learners. Instead, biomedical and life sciences PhD
students and postdoctoral fellows spend most of their working hours in their training laboratories conducting
inquiry-based research. Thus, the research ramp-down, in combination with the lack of structured learning
requirements, created a lot of undefined and unplanned time and space for these learner populations. While faculty
advisors used their discretion to provide some structure to learners’ research through remote data analysis and
writing manuscripts and grant proposals, this likely varied between labs and advisors.

In our state of Michigan, the “Stay Safe, Stay Home” mandate alongside that from UM in mid-March began a period
of time hereafter referred to as Work-From-Home (WFH). Until WFH, our offerings had been exclusively in-person.
We rapidly reimagined our programs to enable remote learning. Through virtual programs, we continued to meet our
learners’ needs. Additionally, we created new programs covering many aspects of written and visual science

communication to meet the likely demand for these skills during WFH and to guide learners’ unstructured time in a
purposeful way. Peer units on our campus and similar teams across the country also pivoted CPD programs from inperson to remote formats.

Upon launching our remote program offerings, we observed a dramatic increase in RSVP numbers as compared to
when our programs were offered exclusively in-person. In order to understand motivators for remote attendance to
CPD programs and to pinpoint specific barriers in program participation before and during WFH, we conducted a
systematic survey. In this manuscript, we share key findings of this survey. These findings, and our evidence-based
recommendations that stem from them, inform future practices for CPD programming. This includes formats and
content for UM and peer institutions across the country. We believe that these recommendations, which can easily
be implemented with limited budgets, enable more flexibility, inclusion, and equity for diverse learners to access
critical programs, albeit extra-curricular, more effectively and efficiently.

METHODS:
CPD Marketing and Communication. All events were marketed via email using the Mailchimp marketing
platform. UM Medical School graduate students and postdoctoral fellows are added to the distribution list during
onboarding. Additional subscribers outside the Medical School are allowed to opt in. The distribution list consists of
approximately 800 graduate students, 1,200 postdocs, and 500 faculty and staff University-wide. The total number
of recipients varies as appointments change or as opt-in or out updates happen. Non-medical school-affiliated are
included in these numbers. Individual event announcements were sent approximately one week prior to the event.
Events were also marketed in a CPD weekly newsletter and listed on our website. Learners could RSVP for events
through the individual event announcements, newsletter, or the website.

RSVP and Attendance Data Collection and Analysis. RSVPs were collected digitally using either Google Forms
or Sessions at Michigan (an internal event management tool developed by the UM Office of the Vice President for
Student Life). During registration, learners were asked to indicate their stage of training, program, and are asked to

submit a question or topic they wish to see addressed during the given event. During earlier CPD offerings,
attendance was collected manually using a paper sign-in sheet. The Sessions at Michigan platform allows for digital
attendance collection for which an Apple iPad was used. Attendance to virtual events during WFH was collected
using the Sessions at Michigan Self-Check-In feature using a shortened URL or QR code. Staff members also crossreferenced the virtual attendee list with the Sessions at Michigan registration to log attendance. All registration and
attendance data in this study were collected using the method described above with one event facilitated by an
outside vendor as the only exception. Statistical significance was established comparing before and during WFH
RSVP and attendance rates each using a 2-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test.

Survey Design and Analysis. The survey created for this study is under IRB exemption (#HUM00187729) from
UM Office of Research. The survey was created using the UM Qualtrics XM survey platform. An electronic link to
the survey with informed consent was distributed to PhD and Master’s students, post-baccalaureate scholars, and
postdocs (approximately 1,200) within the medical school using an internal listserv. The anonymous survey was
active for 8-9 days. The total number of surveys collected was 249 representing approximately 20% of the learner
population. The survey contained a variety of questions related to how learners engaged in CPD activities before and
during the WFH order from the State of Michigan (enacted March 17, 2020). Questions also probed factors that
motivated learners to participate or served as barriers to participation in CPD activities before WFH and during
WFH. Motivators to participation were scored on a four-point scale: not a factor, somewhat of a factor, strong
factor, or N/A (not applicable). The data presented in Figure 3 represent all “somewhat of a factor” and “strong
factor” responses. Respondents selected whether each barrier to participation was a factor before WFH, during
WFH, or neither. Respondents could indicate that a barrier was present both before and during WFH. To assist in
future planning, learners were asked to indicate if they would prefer to engage in in-person or virtual activities and
what their motivations were for either. The survey concluded with several optional demographic questions: stage of
training, years in current position, gender identity, underrepresented minority, and nationality.

At the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies, we have been offering weekly programs for career and
professional development (CPD) tailored for our graduate and postdoctoral learners since January 2018 (refer to our
events calendar). Since the WFH mandate was announced at UM, we carefully pivoted all our programs to remote
formats primarily using video conferencing software such as BlueJeans and Zoom. During this mandate, we
observed changes in RSVP and attendance numbers for similar weekly, non-cohort-based programs when compared
to before WFH (Figure 1A). There was an increase in RSVP with an average 42 RSVPs/event before WFH and 82
RSVPs/event during WFH (Figure 1B). Interestingly, although the average percentage of RSVPs who actually
attended the event went down from slightly (51% pre- to 40% during- WFH) it was not a statistically significant
decrease (Figure 1B). Additionally, we piloted a couple of science communication workshops at the beginning of
remote learning, which gained RSVPs of 300-400/event. Based on this significant interest, we conducted a needs
assessment check-in to understand this considerable uptick. We identified manuscript writing, peer review, and
scientific speaking as further topics of interest. As a result of these, we observed an average of 282 RSVPs/event
with a 57% attendance rate across all science communication topics offered (Figure 1C).

Based on the increased interest in participation from mid-March – August 2020, we were curious to a) identify the
primary motivators that encouraged increased participation and b) better understand the barriers that kept graduate
and postdoctoral learners from attending CPD events before and during WFH. To that end, we created a short survey
that addressed the above questions along with other queries on preferred formats of programming in the future, even
after the pandemic/WFH restrictions have been lifted. The survey was sent out via email to our entire learning
community of Master’s, PhD, and postdocs at the UM Medical School.

First, we asked whether the frequency of the respondent's engagement in CPD programs increased during WFH
(Figure 2). 50% of postdocs indicated that they had increased their frequency of CPD participation during WFH
whereas about 4% were unsure. In the case of Masters and PhD students, fewer respondents said that they had an
increase in the frequency of attending CPD programs during WFH compared to those that did not. Overall, however,
34% of our respondents indicated that they attended more professional development events during WFH and remote
learning.

Next, we wanted to understand what the motivators were for learners to attend remote events during WFH. This
question was filtered to include only respondents who answered “yes” or “not sure” to whether their participation
increased during WFH. As seen in Figure 3, approximately 125 respondents selected either virtual format or
schedule flexibility during WFH as a strong or somewhat of a factor for attendance. Not surprisingly, interest in
science communication events obtained the third highest selections, which is corroborated by the initial needsassessment survey for new programs during WFH. This was followed by increased awareness of events as a
motivator. Pressure to go on the job market and encouragement from PI (Principal Investigator/research advisor)
were ranked below these other factors, but still received a significant number of responses.

Beyond the motivators for learner participation in remote events, we sought to understand the barriers that impacted
learner participation before and during WFH. Across nine barriers listed in the survey, with an additional ‘other’
category, learners were asked if each barrier impacted their ability to participate in CPD activities before WFH,
during WFH, or neither. Respondents could select both before and during WFH. Before WFH,
transportation/location of events, conflict with date/time, and conflict with research responsibilities were significant
barriers to participation, with the top barrier impacting close to half of the respondents (Figure 4A). Our data show a
reduction in each of these barriers during WFH. On the other hand, feeling overwhelmed more than doubled, caring
for dependents went up five-fold, and lack of stable internet went up sixteen-fold as barriers during WFH. Personal
conflicts, awareness of programs, and PI support to attend events remained mostly similar before and during WFH.

Next, we compared changes based on several self-identified demographics in the barriers for CPD event attendance
before and during WFH, including those who chose some barriers for both periods (Figure 4B). While the trends
within each demographic largely reflected the overall trends, there were some variations between groups. The
number of female respondents who reported feeling overwhelmed during WFH increased by 15.4% compared to
their male counterparts who only increased by 6.3%. Barriers related to caring for dependents disproportionately
affected postdocs and international learners during WFH. Also, a greater number of learners who identified as an
Under-Represented Minority (URM) reported that the lack of stable internet was more of a barrier during WFH

compared to non-URM learners. Fewer male respondents reported that barriers due to research responsibilities were
alleviated by WFH compared to female respondents. Interestingly, fewer URM (21.5%) and international (16.9%)
learners reported that barriers related to their research responsibilities were relieved during WFH compared to their
non-URM (36.4%) and domestic (37.8%) counterparts, respectively.
Based on our findings that several barriers to participate in CPD programming differ before and during WFH, we
asked whether there is a correlation between the top barriers before WFH and the top motivator of schedule
flexibility for attending virtual events during WFH. As seen in Figure 4C, the top motivating factors (flexibility of
schedule and virtual format during WFH) correlated very strongly with a decrease in the top three barriers that are
identified between before WFH and during WFH (including respondents who chose both time periods): date and
time conflict, research responsibilities, and transportation to the event location.

Besides understanding the recent motivations and barriers in CPD participation, we also asked our learners about
their preferences for the format of future programming. Our survey asked learners if they would prefer to mostly
engage in remote or in-person events, when in-person events are a safe option once again. Across learner groups,
58% of respondents indicated a preference for remote events, while 42% selected a preference for a return to inperson programs, as highlighted in Figure 5A. Trends per learner group closely followed the same preference.
Respondents who selected remote/virtual programming for the future (n=108) were asked for their top three reasons
driving this preference. Figure 5B shows that 77% noted that they would not lose time on cross-campus
transportation by attending virtual programming. Other top reasons included the ability to watch recorded sessions
afterward (62%) and that remote options helped learners prioritize CPD (58%). Almost half of respondents, 48%,
indicated that they learn equally as well or better in remote situations. Of those who would prefer future remote
programming, 31% indicated a higher level of comfortability when engaging virtually. Lower factors in virtual
preference included learners utilize inclusive teaching features (e.g. closed captioning) in remote learning (19%) and
learners who juggle caregiving duties (8%). Write-in answers further emphasized location and distance, with some
learners living outside of Ann Arbor, thus remote options would be more accessible to them.
Figure 5C displays why 40% of learners prefer a return to in-person CPD. 76% indicated that the physical presence
of an instructor improved learning. Other top reasons referenced the challenge of staying focused when attending a

remote session (67%) and a desire for social interaction (65%). Over 40% of those preferring in-person sessions
shared that they prioritize in-person activities more than remote options, and in conjunction, in-person programs
encourage the physical requirement to leave the lab and work for a short time (42%). To a lesser degree, 27% of
those that favor future in-person events prefer an environment that resembles a physical classroom, including the
presence of peers.

DISCUSSION:
Career and professional development (CPD) training of graduate and postdoctoral learners is pivotal in the changing
landscape of career outcomes (6, 7). Targeted transferable skill building and active career planning is key for future
workforce development (8). Significant strides have been made across several institutions and federal funding
agencies to prioritize quality and quantity of CPD programs (9). These programs are typically offered by several
offices ranging from graduate schools, college-level graduate and postdoctoral training offices, as well as
departmental units. Despite the advances, most training programs do not require CPD program participation toward
meeting any required milestones in education. This in turn meant that when the pandemic-driven shut down of
research and associated WFH mandate was put in place, it was left up to the individual units how they wanted to
continue with their career and professional development programming.

Our team regularly communicates with learners to understand needs and accordingly adapts CPD programming to
meet them. Therefore, tailoring programs at the beginning of remote learning was not an unprecedented move on our
part as it was primarily based on learner feedback. However, the significant spike in RSVP for our routine events
and science communication workshops was rather surprising. Based on this participation increase and learner
feedback, it was clear that they found high value in these programs. We further believe that they used our space to
find purpose during a time when everything else was mostly undefined.

Interestingly, although there was an increase in participation per event during remote learning, fewer than 50% of
the survey respondents said that they increased their frequency of participation. This can be explained either by the

possibility that a) we attracted many of the same learners who in the past attended our program or b) it alludes to a
bias in who responded to the survey or c) it points at a likely misalignment in learner perception. Such a
misalignment can be attributed to the fact that learners may not have the necessary calibration to compare a
before/after timepoint, since CPD is not curricular and is accessed in an ad hoc manner.

From the responses we gathered, it was unequivocal that major barriers exist for learners in planning these events
into their daily schedules. These barriers are exacerbated on large, multi-campus institutions like ours, where labs
are spread out as far as 3 miles away, and transportation/parking are limited, which could be amplified in the winter
months. Interestingly, almost the same number of respondents selected transportation/location as a barrier before
WFH as those who indicated it was not a barrier during either time. This suggests that learners from labs proximal to
routine program venues are able to attend more easily than others. While the location issue could theoretically be
solved by offering programs in multiple locations, in many campuses access to reserving classroom spaces to meet
capacity and other requirements are often a huge premium. Additionally, some event spaces require an internal fee.
Learner access to parking continues to be a huge limitation, making it equally difficult for learners who are able to
use their own vehicles to commute to the events. Finally, like many of our peer institutions, our CPD programming
is supported by a small staff with limited capacity to run events in multiple locations. These barriers collectively
drive systemic inequities in learners’ ability to access in-person programs.

Conflict with research responsibilities was indicated as a major barrier to attending CPD events before and, to a
lesser extent, during WFH. This conflict, at some level, is at odds with national recommendations from the National
Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (3, 10), the Council for Graduate Schools (3), and the National
Postdoc Association’s Core Competency List, all of which strongly suggest that CPD programs be integral to
learning in order to build skills for developing future workforce. While those learners on federal training grants
make targeted plans for CPD requirements and to meet funding expectations, the intentional planning or
participation mandates are not the same for others. Thus, without changes in programmatic elements and
infrastructural support, the barriers to balance research with CPD program engagement will continue to limit the
holistic development of graduate and postdoctoral learners. This is of particular importance as several barriers

disproportionately impact learners in marginalized demographic groups. While international learners reported
conflicts with date, time, and research responsibilities decreased during WFH, this decrease was less than half what
domestic learners reported. This could be because domestic learners are better aware of research expectations and
balancing time. This brings up the idea of a “hidden curriculum” wherein learners new to (American) Higher
Education systems are not aware of expectations that are not overtly communicated (11). This also
disproportionately affects first-generation learners (12). The inequities revealed between URM/international learners
and non-URM/domestic learners around barriers due to research responsibilities suggests that international and
URM learners felt or were more compelled to continue research activities despite research ramp down and the WFH
mandate. The barriers faced included access to critical WFH resources such as stable internet, which impacted more
URM learners during WFH than non-URM learners, and assistance in caring for dependents, which affected more
postdocs and international learners. Many of these inequities could be ameliorated by creating resources including
protected time aligned with clear expectations for competency development within the training experience for all
learners to engage in professional development activities not limited to coursework and research. An intentional
professional development curriculum will not only drive success in a learner’s future career but will also enhance
academic success and outcomes in their training years.

Science communication training including the core areas of written communication including manuscript writing,
creating figures, peer review best practices occurs within the research labs with ad hoc guidance by PIs or senior lab
members. The unprecedented interest and attendance we had for these events indicates that the historical
apprenticeship-based training where communication skill building and feedback is primarily dependent on advisors
or labs is not sufficient. Our data indicate that this is an area of immediate and high need that should be formalized
into the training journeys of both graduate and postdoctoral learners.

As we plan for a future when returning fully to in-person work is not a barrier, we find that the split between
learners who prefer remote learning as compared to in-person is small. Importantly, the reasons picked for either
preference align with their personal motivations and barriers. Moreover, these data shed light on other systemic
issues. For example, postdoctoral fellows place higher weight on the physical instructor presence and on peer social

interaction when they indicate an in-person preference. This aligns with postdoctoral training years being isolating
for many learners (13, 14).

In the future, we recommend institutional infrastructures for graduate and postdoctoral CPD learning to have core
features for flexibility, accessibility, and inclusion, as shown in Figure 6, to complement other published
recommendations (15). Ultimately, CPD can be easily adapted for remote learning compared to many other aspects
of biomedical graduate and postdoctoral training. Despite this, it has not been at the forefront of learning goals for
advanced STEM learners. Herein, based on our experiences delivering remote programs during a pandemic, we have
uncovered new barriers as well as corroborated previously known issues. Based on learner voices, we use this
opportunity to provide institutional recommendations toward making CPD more accessible to all learners.

Finally, the barrier of “feeling overwhelmed” was unambiguous in learners reporting this feeling before and during
WFH. Such feelings among graduate students have been discussed in another recent study after the pandemic (16).
Although this feeling can easily be attributed to the overall mood of 2020, which has been beset with multiple
calamities converging at once, learners need dedicated and proactive support in mental health and well-being at
every stage of their training and under all circumstances (17), so they can show up to engage fully. Our
recommendations to maximize CPD planning into the daily lives of busy learners, if turned into action, may at least
alleviate anxieties around career prospects and build confidence in our future leaders.

Figure 3: Primary Motivators for Increased Participation in CPD Programming During Remote Learning
and WFH
Learner responses (n=145, x-axis) on the level of influence by each of six motivators (y-axis) on participation are
shown. Respondents could indicate whether each motivator was “strong factor” in participation, “somewhat of a
factor”, “not a factor”, or “not applicable”. Respondents who selected motivators as a “strong factor” or “somewhat
of a factor” in participation were pooled. Respondents who identified motivators as “not applicable” are not shown.

Figure 4: Primary Barriers for Participation in CPD Programming Before and During WFH
A. Learner responses to whether nine barriers (y-axis) were a factor in their ability to participate in CPD activities
before WFH (blue), during WFH (yellow), both before and during WFH (red) or not a factor during either time
period (grey). Total responses for each selection are reported (y-axis).
B. Barriers encountered by learners were broken down by demographic or self-described identity. Responses in this
table include barriers before WFH, during WFH, and both. Values reported are the change in percent of responses
within each demographic normalized to the total number of responses within the demographic (n). Demographic
reporting was voluntary. Data shown only for respondents who self-identified. (URM = Under-Represented
Minority; Intl = International; Dom = Domestic; PI = Principal Investigator). Data from learners identifying as nonbinary gender identifies were not included as the number of responses was too small to maintain anonymity.
C. Responses to three barriers that decreased during WFH and two barriers that increased during WFH were filtered
to only include those who indicated that increased flexibility of schedule or virtual format during WFH was a
motivator to attending virtual CPD programming.

A. Learners responses (n=186) on preference for future CPD program format in either remote or in-person events.
Responses are separated by training stage.
B. Learners who prefer future remote CPD programming (n=108) chose the top three reasons among seven choices
(y-axis) for their preference. Reported are the number of times each reason was selected (x-axis).
C. Learners who prefer future in-person CPD programming (n=78) chose the top three reasons among six choices
(y-axis) for their preference. Reported are the number of times each reason was selected (x-axis).

Recommendations for Future Career & Professional Development Programs
Maximize learner engagement with flexible
and accessible programming.
Provide a blended form of in-person and
remote learning as the norm toward equity.

Empower learners to plan CPD as a central
goal for training success with institutional
support.
Activate tailored plans for transferable
skill-building and career exploration.
Provide protected time to attend CPD
events to bring plans to fruition.

Be inclusive of learners with diverse
abilities and access to resources.
Record, caption, and archive
programs for learners unable to
attend in real-time.

Create structured interactions when
programming is offered virtually.
Communicate learning goals in
advance and indicate whether video
or in-person participation is expected
so learners can be prepared.

Figure 6: Future Recommendations: To serve as guidelines for practitioners, administrators, and institutions
toward enabling flexible, inclusive, equitable, and engaging Career and Professional Development (CPD) programs
for graduate and postdoctoral learners.
