Abstract
Subunit vaccines based on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV2, are among the most promising strategies to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The detailed
characterization of the protein primary structure by mass spectrometry (MS) is mandatory, as
described in ICHQ6B guidelines. In this work, several recombinant RBD proteins produced in
five expression systems were characterized using a non-conventional protocol known as insolution buffer-free digestion (BFD). In a single ESI-MS spectrum, BFD allowed very high
sequence coverage (≥ 99 %) and the detection of highly hydrophilic regions, including very short
and hydrophilic peptides (2-8 amino acids), the His6-tagged C-terminal peptide carrying several
post-translational modifications at Cys538 such as cysteinylation, glutathionylation, cyanilation,
among others. The analysis using the conventional digestion protocol allowed lower sequence
coverage (80-90 %) and did not detect peptides carrying some of the above-mentioned posttranslational modifications. The two C-terminal peptides of a dimer [RBD(319-541)-(His)6]2 linked
by an intermolecular disulfide bond (Cys538-Cys538) with twelve histidine residues were only
detected by BFD. This protocol allows the detection of the four disulfide bonds present in the
native RBD and the low-abundance scrambling variants, free cysteine residues, O-glycoforms
and incomplete processing of the N-terminal end, if present. Artifacts that might be generated
by the in-solution BFD protocol were also characterized. BFD can be easily implemented and we
foresee that it can be also helpful to the characterization of mutated RBD.

Introduction
The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 reported for the first time in Wuhan, China (1) has rapidly
spread all over the world, causing more than 3.3 million deaths and 159 million of infected
people until May 2021 (2). Currently, this pandemic represents a major threat for the health,
the economy and the whole society.
The development of effective vaccines as well as the universal access for their massive
introduction are urgently needed to control the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide (3). Nowadays,
there are several vaccine platforms being evaluated according to the draft landscape published
by the World Health Organization (4), including inactivated and live attenuated virus, nonreplicating and replicating viral vectors, DNA-, mRNA-, virus-like particles, and protein subunit
vaccines. Some of them have already been approved by the WHO and regulatory authorities
and introduced with favorable results in the clinic (5).
SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein for entry into the
host cells through a high affinity interaction with its cell-surface expressed receptor, the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (6, 7). The RBD has been proposed for the rational
development of protective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (8, 9) and nowadays subunit vaccines
are well-represented among the candidates investigated in preclinical studies and clinical trials,
according a recent WHO report (4). For a successful introduction of vaccines into the clinic, the
immunogens need to be produced at scale and prices affordable for all, including middle- and
low-income countries (3).
Probably this is one of the reasons why RBD of SARS-CoV-2, besides its production in
mammalian cells (10), has also been produced in several systems such as insect cells (11), yeast

(12, 13), C1 Thermothelomyces heterothallica (formerly Myceliophthora thermophila) (14, 15),
baculovirus-silkworm system (16) and bacteria (17) despite of the challenge that represents the
expression of a non-globular protein with four disulfide bonds and the requirement of the Nglycosylation for its proper expression and folding (12).
The ICHQ6B guidelines (18), harmonized among most important regulatory agencies worldwide,
state the key role of mass spectrometry (MS) to develop well-characterized products in the
biotechnology industry. MS is the analytical tool of choice for the verification of the amino acid
sequence, to demonstrate the integrity of the N- and C-terminal ends, and to detect posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in natural and recombinant proteins. The presence of PTMs
may modify the physico-chemical, and immunological properties of the proteins. In particular, a
disulfide bonds arrangement identical to the present in the native protein, is mandatory for
biotherapeutics as well as for vaccine development in cases where the antigen should be well
folded to raise conformational and topological neutralizing antibodies (19, 20).
Sample processing prior to MS analysis also plays a determinant role in the quality of the
results. In the characterization of recombinant proteins, an efficient proteolytic digestion and
the recovery of the proteolytic peptides is mandatory to obtain the highest sequence coverage,
including the identification of PTMs. In particular, if electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS) is used, a desalting step is needed to ionize properly the proteolytic peptides. This
step, although necessary, often comprises the recovery of highly hydrophilic and hydrophobic
peptides when, either commercial or in-house prepared micro-columns, based on reverse
phase chromatography are used.

Arbeitman et al (12) analyzed by MALDI-MS the in-solution tryptic digests of two reduced and
S-alkylated recombinant RBD of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in P. pastoris and in a mammalian cell
line (HEK-293T). The tryptic peptides were desalted by C18-ZipTips prior to mass spectrometric
analysis and although sequence identity was unequivocally demonstrated in both cases, the
sequence coverage was only 40 and 60% for the proteins expressed in P. pastoris and HEK-293T
cells, respectively. In that experiment, some of the internal short and/or hydrophilic peptides
(318SR319, 379CYGVSPTK386, 418IDIAYNYK424, 455LFR457, and 530STNLVK535) were not verified for any
proteins. The C-terminal peptide containing the tandem repeat of six histidine residues
(LPETGHHHHHH), was only detected for the recombinant protein expressed in P. pastoris,
suggesting variable results in the desalting step. The unmodified peptide located at the Nterminal region (320VQPTESIVR328) was only assigned for the case of RBD expressed in P.
pastoris. Probably the presence of O-glycosylation site(s) at Thr323/Ser325 (21) makes this
peptide more hydrophylic when RBD was expressed in HEK-293T cell line and in consequence
the peptide was not retained in the desalting step and not detected in MALDI-MS analysis (12).
Also two internal peptides (F329-R346 and D467-R509) containing three (Cys336, Cys480 and Cys488)
out of the eight cysteine residues were not detected in any protein. The peptide
329

FPNITNLCPFGEVFNATR346 was not detected propably because it contains two potential N-

glycosylation sites at Asn331 and Asn343 (21) fully occupied by N-glycans and a deglycosylation
step with PNGase F was not conceived in the sample processing to facilitate its detection. On
the other hand, the long and hydrophobic peptide D467-R509 containing two cysteine residues
(Cys480-Cys488) probably was not efficiently eluted from the C18-Ziptips (12). In the same
manuscript, the arrangement of disulfide bonds and the presence of free cysteine residues

were not verified by mass spectrometry because of the reduction and S-alkylation steps
included in the sample processing, probably introduced to make more efficient the tryptic
digestion, impaired their detection (12). The detection of non-desired free cysteine residues in
the molecule, even present as low-abundance species, is also a matter of great importance
because they may promote disulfide exchange and generate scrambling variants (22).
In our laboratory, we initially demonstrated that proteins separated by SDS-PAGE can be
efficiently in-gel desalted and digested in water with trypsin in absence of traditional saline
buffers (23). This procedure avoids a desalting step of the proteolytic peptides and allows their
direct analysis by ESI-MS (23). This non-conventional procedure moves away from the
conventional canons of biochemistry, but it avoids the loss of hydrophobic tryptic peptides and
guaranteed sequence coverage higher than the achieved by the traditional in-gel digestion
protocol. Our procedure has allowed full-sequence coverage of ATPase subunit 9, the most
hydrophobic protein of S. cerevisiae proteome by an in-gel digestion procedure (23).
In the biotechnology industry, for the quality control of recombinant proteins, in-solution
protein digestion is more frequently used than in-gel digestion procedures due to its greater
efficiency and simplicity and also because sample amount is generally not a concern.
Recently, the principles of the in-gel buffer-free digestion protocol (23) were extended to insolution buffer-free digestion (BFD) of other proteins (24). In-solution BFD protocol improved
the sequence coverage of certain regions of proteins represented by short and hydrophilic
peptides including some N-glycopeptides, short peptides linked by disulfide bonds as well as
hydrophilic C-terminal peptides of proteins that contain a tandem repeat of six histidine
residues (24).

In particular, the introduction of a tandem repeat of six histidine residues at the N- or at the Cterminal end of the recombinant proteins is frequently used to facilitate the purification by
immobilized metal affinity chromatography. This procedure although efficient, can turn the Nand C-terminal peptides, into more hydrophilic species and it makes more difficult their
recovery from the desalting step prior ESI-MS analysis. The integrity of the N-and C-terminal
ends is an aspect requested by the ICHQ6B due to their propensity to be proteolytic processed
by the host cell proteases and at the same time they carry PTMs (18).
Considering that subunit vaccines based on the recombinant RBD are very well-represented
among the different strategies for the development of vaccines against COVID-19,
in this work, we adapted the in-solution BFD protocol (24) to the analysis of the products of six
gene constructs containing the RBD sequence from SARS-CoV-2 obtained in five different
expression systems, such as mammalian cells (CHO and HEK-293T), yeast (P. pastoris), bacteria
(E. coli) and fungus (Thermothelomyces heterothallica). Unlike the standard protocol that uses
salt buffers and desalting through reverse phase microcolumns, the implemented BFD method
avoids buffers and desalting is carried out by precipitation, allowing very high sequencecoverage (≥ 99 %) of these RBDs, and the detection of PTMs including those located at the Nand the C-terminal end. The BFD protocol allowed the identification, in a single mass spectrum,
of the four native disulfide bonds as well as scrambled disulfide bonds, the presence of free
cysteine residues, N- and O-glycosylation, and other PTMs of known and unknown nature
linked to an unpaired cysteine residue present in some of the analyzed RBD molecules.

Materials and methods
Cloning expression and purification of RBD variants
Seven RBD recombinant proteins, produced at laboratory scale in a wide range of host cells,
were used as model antigens to develop and refine suitable analytical methods for RBD
characterization. Table 1 summarizes their sequences. The procedures for cloning, expression
and purification are further described below.
RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3 and RBD(319-541)-HEK from transient transfection of HEK-293T cells
The coding sequence for RBD319-541 was optimized for mammalian cell expression (hamster,
Cricetulus griseus), using the online gene optimization tools provided by Eurofins (Germany).
The optimized nucleotide sequence was assembled and amplified by PCR using gene fragments
synthesized by Eurofins and oligonucleotides synthesized at CIGB (Cuba), and cloned into
pCMX/His vector through BssHII and NotI restriction sites. The use of NotI site resulted in the
introduction of three alanine residues between RBD and His6 tag in the coded protein. A second
version of the genetic construct (coding for a recombinant protein without additional Ala
residues) was obtained by assembling RBD319-541 sequence directly followed by the gene ofHis6
tag and a stop codon, and cloning that insert in the same expression vector. HEK-293T cells
adapted to grow in suspension in Freestyle F-17 medium were transfected with the resulting
genetic constructs, using linear polyethyleneimine as the transfection agent. Transfected cells
were fed with fresh media plus tryptone (0.5% final concentration) 48 h post-transfection.
Supernatant was harvested five days after feeding, and the recombinant protein was purified
from cell culture supernatant by IMAC with Ni-NTA Sepharose. Proteins were buffer-exchanged
with PBS pH 7.4 using PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare).

(RBD(319-541)-CHO)2 from transduced CHO-K1 cells
The whole expression cassette including the gene coding for RBD 319-541 (from CMV promoter to
His6 tag and stop codon) was amplified by PCR from pCMX/His (see the previous section) and
re-cloned into the lentiviral vector pL6WBlast (CIGB, Cuba) with the restriction enzymes XhoI
and EcoRV. Lentiviral particles containing the gene of interest were produced and used for
stable transduction of CHO-K1 cells. Cells producing the recombinant protein were grown in
protein-free medium (a mixture of a proprietary Center for Molecular Immunology medium
with PFHMII) with shaking. Recombinant RBD319-541 was purified from cell culture supernatant
by IMAC with Ni-IDA Sepharose, followed by SP cation exchange chromatography. Dimeric and
monomeric fractions were subsequently isolated by size exclusion chromatography with
Superdex 200 in PBS pH 7.4.
RBD(331-529)-Ec from Escherichia coli
A sequence coding for residues 331-530 of the Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 was obtained by
reverse transcription from nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients and amplification by
PCR, adding a Nhe I site at the 5’ end and a stop codon and a Sal I site at the 3’ end. The
resulting amplicon, after digestion with these enzymes, was cloned in-frame into Nhe I/Sal Idigested pET28a+ (Novagen, USA). Transformation of the resulting construct into NiCo21(DE3)
cells (New England Biolabs, USA) and culture in a ZY5052 medium (25) resulted in the
expression of an N-terminally His-tagged RBD, which was purified from inclusion bodies using
immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) under denaturing conditions. Protein was
eluted using 16 mM phosphate-buffered, 300 mM NaCl, 150 mM imidazole, pH 6.8. Fractions
were pooled and buffer-exchanged to sodium carbonate/hydrogen carbonate buffer pH 10

using a Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare, UK). Recombinant protein was stored at -20 oC
until required. An aliquot of 200 g was buffer-exchanged to PBS (12 mM Na2HPO4.2H2O, 3 mM
NaH2PO4.2H2O, 150 mM NaCl pH 7.4) using Sephadex PD-10 columns (Pharmacia).
RBD(333-527)-C1 expressed in thermophile C1, Thermothelomyces heterothallica
A sequence coding for a C1 endogenous signal sequence, the residues 333-527 of the Spike
protein from SARS-CoV-2 (RBD), a GlySer-linker and the C-tag flanked by PmeI sites was
amplified by PCR from a synthetic fragment provided by GenScript (USA), codon-optimized for
expression in a low protease background C1, Thermothelomyces heterothallica (formerly M.
thermophila) strain. The fragment was cloned into a C1 expression vector under a C1
endogenous promoter. The ready expression vector and a mock vector partner needed for a
complete marker gene were digested with PmeI and co-transformed to a low protease
background C1 strain. The transformation was done with protoplast/PEG method (14) and
transformants were selected for nia1+ phenotype and hygromycin resistance. Transformants
were streaked once to selective medium and screened by Western blotting of culture
supernatant samples from 24-well plate cultures.
C1 transformants producing RBD-C-tag were purified by single colony plating and analyzed by
PCR for correct integration of the expression cassette and clone purity. A purified clone was
then selected for cultivation in a 1 L bioreactor in a fed-batch process with a medium containing
glucose as the carbon source and (NH4)2SO4 and yeast extract as the nitrogen sources. The
fermentation was carried out for 5 days at pH 6.8 at 38 oC. RBD-C-tag was purified from 116 h
time point of the fermentation by C-tag affinity chromatography with the CaptureSelect C-tagXL

was dialyzed against PBS.
RBD(331-530)-cmyc from Pichia pastoris
A sequence coding for residues 331-530 of the Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 flanked by EcoR I
and Xba I sites was amplified by PCR from a synthetic fragment provided by Eurofins
(Germany), codon-optimized for expression into Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae). After
digestion with these enzymes, the fragment was cloned in-frame with the S. cerevisiae alpha
factor pre-pro peptide into EcoR I/Xba I-digested pPICK-αA (a pPICZ-αA derivative bearing a
G418 resistant selection marker). Transformation of the resulting construct into P. pastoris
GS115, selection of clones resistant to high G418 concentrations, and culture of one
representative clone in BMGY/BMMY (Invitrogen, USA) resulted in the secretion into the
supernatant of an RBD variant tagged C-terminally with C-myc and His6 sequences, which was
further purified by IMAC on Ni-NTA agarose and gel filtration.
In-solution buffer-free digestion (BFD) protocol
Fifty micrograms of the protein dissolved in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 M guanidine
hydrochloride reacted with 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) during 30 min at room temperature
(22 oC). One microliter of PNGase F (New England Biolabs) was added and the deglycosylation
reaction proceeded during two hours at 37 oC. Also, N-glycosylated RBD(333-527)-C1 was reduced
with 10 mM dithiotreitol and 0.2 M Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0 for 1 h at 37 oC, and then S-alkylated
with 25 mM iodoacetamide in the dark for 20 min at 22 oC. All samples were cooled at room
temperature and proteins were precipitated with ten volumes of cold acetone (-20 oC) or 80%

ethanol (v/v) and the solution was kept at -80±5 ˚C during 1 h. The sample was centrifuged at
10000 rpm during 5 minutes and the supernatant was discarded. The precipitate was washed
by vortexing with 75% cold acetone or ethanol (-20 oC), centrifuged at 10000 rpm during 5 min
and the supernatant was discarded. This procedure was repeated twice and the final
precipitate was dried up in a vacuum centrifuge during 15 min. The precipitate was dissolved in
50 L of 20% (v/v) acetonitrile in water solution with 1 min vortex and 10 min of sonication in a
water bath. One microgram of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) dissolved in water was
added to the protein solution and the specific proteolytic digestion proceeded for 16 h at 37 oC
in a thermomixer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Digestion was centrifuged at 10000 rpm during 1
min and 4 L of the resultant mixture of tryptic peptides was mixed with 0.3 L of 90% formic
acid and it was loaded into a metal coated borosilicate nanocapilar for mass spectrometric
analysis.
Standard digestion (SD) protocol
Fifty micrograms of the protein dissolved in PBS (pH 7.2) containing 0.5 M guanidine
hydrochloride reacted with 5 mM NEM during 30 min at room temperature (22 oC). One
microliter of PNGase F (New England Biolabs) was added and the deglycosylation reaction
proceeded during two hours at 37 oC. The sample was four-fold diluted and the protein
digested in presence of 0.2 M Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0 and 1 g of sequencing grade trypsin
(Promega) previously dissolved in 20 mM acetic acid. Tryptic digestion proceeded for 16 h at 37
o

C and digestion was stopped with a final 5% formic acid (v/v). The resulting peptides were

desalted with ZipTip C18 (Millipore, USA), washed with 0.2% (v/v) formic acid solution, and
eluted in 4 L of 60% acetonitrile in water containing 0.2% formic acid (v/v).

Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis
Seven micrograms of the proteins deglycosylated with PNGase F as described above and the Nglycosylated RBD(333-527)-C1, were mixed with equal volume of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride
solution and desalted by using ZipTip C18 (Millipore, USA). The protein was extensively washed
with 0.2% (v/v) formic acid solution and finally eluted in 3 L of 60% acetonitrile in water
containing 0.2% formic acid (v/v). The elution was loaded into the metal coated nanocapillary
for ESI-MS analysis.
The mixture of tryptic peptides was analyzed in a hybrid orthogonal QTof-2 tandem mass
spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) by spraying the sample into the ion source using
1200 and 35 volts for the capillary and the entrance cone, respectively. The ESI-MS were
acquired from m/z 200-2000 and the multiply-charged ions were manually fragmented by
collision induced dissociation using appropriated collision energies (20-50 eV) to obtain
structural information in the MS/MS spectra. Argon was used as a collision gas and the mass
spectra were processed by using MassLynx v4.1 (Micromass, UK). The ESI-MS/MS of tryptic
peptides with z≥3+ were deconvoluted by MaxEnt 3.0. The multiply-charged ESI-MS spectrum
(m/z 400-3000) of the protein deglycosylated with PNGase F was deconvoluted (mass 500070000) by using the MaxtEnt1.0 tool. The theoretical m/z for tryptic peptides as well as for the
intact protein was calculated by using the peptide and protein editor available in the MassLynx
v4.1 software (Micromass, UK).

SDS-PAGE analysis
RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3, (RBD(319-541)-CHO)2 and RBD(331-529)-Ec proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE
as described by Laemmli (26), under reducing and non-reducing conditions. Two micrograms of
N-glycosylated and deglycosylated proteins were applied in a 12.5%T, 3%C acrylamidebisacrylamide separating gel at 30 mA/gel until the tracking dye left the gel. Proteins were
detected by silver staining (27) or Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, gel images were analyzed
with a GS-900 calibrated imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad) and processed with Image Lab v6.0
software (Bio-Rad).
NP-HPLC analysis
N-glycosylation profile was determined by using the procedure described by Guile et al. (28).
Briefly, the N-glycans released by PNGase F treatment were derivatized with 2-amino
benzamide (2AB) by reductive amination. The chromatographic separation was carried out in
an HPLC Prominence-Shimadzu (Japan) using a linear gradient from 20% to 53% of 50 mM, pH
4.4 ammonium formate (solution A) and pure acetronitrile (solution B). 2AB N-glycans
separation was performed on an Amide-80 column (TSKgel 250x46 mm, 5 µm, Tosohaas, Japan)
and the derivatized oligosaccharides were detected on-line by fluorescence using an excitation
and detection wavelengths of 330 nm and 420 nm, respectively. The structural assignment was
performed by comparing the experimental GU values with the GlycoStore database
(https://glycostore.org/). GU values were calculated from the retention time of each peak using
as reference an HPLC separation ran under similar conditions for the 2AB derivatives of a
dextran ladder generated by acid partial hydrolysis. Glycans structures were represented
according to GlycoStore nomenclature.

Results and discussion
Comparison between the standard digestion (SD) and the in-solution buffer-free digestion
(BFD) protocols
Both, the SD (Fig. 1a) and the in-solution BFD (24) (Fig. 1b) protocols, start with the S-alkylation
of free cysteine residues by adding an excess of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) or iodoacetamide
(IAA). This step blocks the free thiol groups that can be present either because the RBD contains
an odd number of cysteine residues or these groups were not quantitatively linked and thus
remain partially free by a non-correct folding. At the same time, the alkylating agent added at
the beginning of the protocol avoids artifacts due to the disulfide bond exchange during the
subsequent steps (22). This could be more critical in the conventional protocol using a basic pH
during tryptic digestion (29, 30). The use of a slightly acidic pH for trypsin digestion (pH 5.5-6.0)
with BFD minimizes artificial modifications introduced during sample preparation such as
scrambling due to the presence of free Cys in the analyzed protein. The S-alkylating agent
introduce an artificial mass tag that facilitates the assignment when any Cys is partially free
and differentiate them from species modified with natural thiol-blocking groups due to
alkylating species present in the culture media (31).
As a second step, both protocols comprise the deglycosylation with PNGase F of the
recombinant RBDs and convert the fully glycosylated asparagines (Asn331/Asn343) into aspartic
acids. This step also facilitates the detection and sequencing of two peptides (Phe329-Arg346) and
(Ile358-Lys378) linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond between Cys336 and Cys361. For the
particular cases of RBD(333-527)-C1 and RBD(331-530)-cmyc-Pp the peptide with the disulphide bond
Cys336-Cys361 at the same time contains the N-terminal end of the protein. The identification of

the disulfide bonds as well as the N-terminal sequencing of the protein are aspects inquired by
regulatory agencies to develop well-characterized products according the ICHQ6B guidelines
(18).
For the in-solution SD protocol (Fig. 1a), the pH of the solution is adjusted at basic pH and the
deglycosylated RBD is digested with trypsin during 16 hours due to our interest to guarantee an
efficient digestion. Also note that even after disulfide reduction this protein has been digested
overnight by other authors (12, 32). Finally, the digestion is quenched by adding formic acid and
the resultant tryptic peptides are desalted by using C18-ZipTips and eluted in a solution
compatible with ESI-MS analysis.
For the in-solution BFD protocol (Fig. 1b), a desalting step is achieved at the protein level by
conventional precipitation protocols using either cold acetone (33) or ethanol (34). Here,
washing steps are included to minimize inorganic ions that may provoke adduct signals in the
mass spectra. Protein resuspension is guaranteed by vigorous vortex and ultrasonic bath in 20%
acetonitrile, before adding trypsin previously dissolved in water. There are no appreciable
differences on both workflows (Fig. 1a and 1b) respect to the processing time before MS
analysis.
Characterization of RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3 and RBD(319-541)-HEK proteins
RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3 (Table 1) expressed in HEK-293T mammalian cell line has four disulfide
bonds and a free cysteine residue (Cys538) located towards the C-terminal region of the protein.
The high reactivity of Cys538 can be used for either site-directed chemical conjugation to highly
immunogenic carrier proteins such as tetanus toxoid (35).

RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE in non-reducing conditions (Fig. 2a, lane 2)
showing an intense and diffuse band at 33.3 kDa corresponding to the monomer with the
heterogeneity of the N-glycosylation. Also, a band detected at 59.7 kDa representing
approximately 13% was assigned to the dimer. After treatment with PNGase F, and analyzed
under non-reducing conditions these bands migrated at 29.3 and 43.9 kDa (Fig. 2a, lane 3)
confirming that RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3 is N-glycosylated. The presence of O-glycosylation was not
excluded because PNGase F does not hydrolyze O-glycans covalently linked to serine or
threonine. When the same samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions only
protein bands corresponding to the glycosylated monomer (Fig. 2a, lane 5) and the
deglycosylated monomer (Fig. 2a, lane 6) were detected. No evidence of the dimer were
observed suggesting that dimerization of the molecule was mediated by disulfide bonds and
not due to an aggregation artifact.
To confirm the integrity, the N-deglycosylated protein was analyzed by ESI-MS (Fig. 2b) and
showed intense multiply-charged signals corresponding to z=11+ to 19+ of the protein. The
deconvoluted ESI-MS spectrum (Fig. 2c) shows the most intense signal with molecular mass of
27195.08 Da that agreed with the expected mass (27195.46 Da) considering the Ndeglycosylated monomer of RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3, cysteinylated and O-glycosylated with
HexNAc:Hex:NeuAc2 (Table 2). Other groups that also expressed RBD molecules in HEK-293
with an odd number of cysteine residues reported cysteinylation (32, 35). O-glycosylation has
been reported for the native RBD of SARS-Cov-2 (21, 36) as well as for several RBD expressed in
mammalian cells (32, 35).

Also, of other signals observed in Fig. 2c (see inset) and summarized in Table 2 suggest the
presence of other modified species of the N-deglycosylated RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3. Separately, the
N-deglycosylated protein was digested in-solution with trypsin by using the SD (Fig. 1a) and BFD
(Fig. 1b) protocols and the resultant ESI-MS spectra are shown in Fig. 2d and Fig. 2e,
respectively. The sequence assignment based on the agreement between the expected and
experimental m/z of tryptic peptides are summarized in Table 3. The four disulfide bonds
present in the native RBD of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 were identified by both protocols (Fig. 2d
and 2e) and confirmed by MS/MS analysis (Fig. S1a-S1d).
In the SD protocol only the N-terminal peptide R319-R328 containing HexNAc:Hex:NeuAc2 was
detected (Fig. 2d, Table 3), presumably linked to either at Thr323 or Ser325 according to previous
reports (32, 36). However, in the in-solution BFD protocol the peptides R319-R328 and V320-R328
linked to HexNAc; HexNAc:Hex; HexNAc:Hex:NeuAc; HexNAc:Hex:NeuAc2; HexNAc2:Hex2:NeuAc
and HexNAc2:Hex2:NeuAc2 were detected (Fig. 2e, Table 3). Five out of the six O-glycans
structures were detected only by the in-solution BFD protocol and these six O-glycans
structures agree very well with the previous reports of O-glycosylation of Thr323/Ser325 in the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (21, 36). MS/MS spectra of these O-glycopeptides confirmed this
assignment (Fig. S2a-S2c) by showing intense neutral losses of glycans from the precursor ions
fragmented by CID according to previous reports (37).
Full-sequence of RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3 was verified by using in-solution BFD protocol, while using
the SD protocol 82% of sequence coverage was achieved (Table 2).
Several signals in the low-mass region (m/z 200-700) were exclusively detected when RBD(319541)-HEK_A3

was analyzed by the BFD protocol and they were assigned to short and hydrophilic

internal peptides (356KR357, 536NK537, 455LFR457, 404GDEVR408, 409QIAPGQTGK417, 418IADYNYK424,

KSTNLVK535 and 530STNLVK535, Table 3). These peptides represent the 18% of the RBD(319-541)-

HEK_A3 sequence. Most of them (356KR357, 455LFR457, 409QIAPGQTGK417, 418IADYNYK424,
529

KSTNLVK535 and 530STNLVK535) were not detected by Arbeitman et al. (12) when the same RBD

protein expressed in P. pastoris and HEK-293T cell line was digested with a protocol similar to
the in-solution SD protocol and analyzed by MALDI-MS. Two of them (404GDEVR408 and 536NK537)
were only detected in the RBD expressed in HEK-293T, probably included in the sequences of
more hydrophobic peptides containing missed cleavages sites.
The C-terminal peptide with the C538 alkylated with NEM (538CVNF541-AAAHHHHHH, m/z 548.24,
3+, Fig. 2g and Table 3) was detected by both protocols (Fig. 1a-b). It confirmed that a fraction
of this RBD contains an unpaired free C538 residue. However, the low-intensity of the signal
assigned to the C-terminal peptide with a C538 alkylated with NEM (m/z 548.27, 3+; Fig. 2g and
Table 3) when BFD protocol was applied suggested that Cys538 should be modified with other
chemical groups.
Cyanylation (m/z 541.91, 3+; (C538+CN)3+, Fig. 2f), cysteinylation (m/z 546.25, 3+; (C538+Cys)3+,
Fig. 2g) and glutathionylation (m/z 608.26, 3+; (C538+ECG)3+, Fig. 2h) of the unpaired Cys538 in
the C-terminal peptide of RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3 was detected exclusively when using the BFD
protocol. The assignment of these modified peptides was confirmed by MS/MS analysis (Fig.
3a-3c). A signal detected at m/z 565.26, 3+ was also only observed when RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3
was analyzed by BFD (Table 3). MS/MS analysis demonstrated that it corresponded to the
same C-terminal peptide (C538+CG)3+ with the C538 linked to a truncated variant of glutathion
(Fig. S3a).

The alkylation with NEM, inserted in our protocols (Fig. 1a, b), transformed the hydrophilic Cterminal peptide (containing the unpaired C538) in a more hydrophobic species and in
consequence it was detected even using the SD protocol. On the contrary, the remaining Cys‐
capping modifications (31) mentioned above (cyanylation, glutathionylation, cysteinylation and
truncated glutathionylation) did not increase the hydrobicity of the C-terminal peptide
sufficiently to be retained by ZipTip-C18 and they were detected exclusively when in-solution
BFD was applied.
Signals detected at m/zExp 517.24, 3+ (Fig. 2f) and m/zExp 541.91, 3+ (Fig. 2g) were assigned as
(C538+32 Da)3+ and (C538+106 Da)3+, corresponding to the C-terminal peptide with C538 linked to
modifying groups of unknown chemical nature. These signals were only detected when insolution BFD was applied to the characterization of RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3. We also found thirteen
other different variants of the C-terminal peptide (confirmed by MS/MS, see Fig. S3) that were
not assigned to a defined chemical structure of Cys538 (see Table 3).
Opossed to the thesis proposing that oxidoreductase‐mediated protein disulfide bonding with
free cysteine or glutathione in the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum (38-40) as the source of
these modifications, Zhong et al. have demonstrated that these modifications are generated
outside mammalian cells and are sensitive to the culture medium composition (31).
Interestingly, the authors also proposed the addition of chemically modified drugs to the
culture medium to obtain homogeneous drug conjugates in a single step avoiding the need for
an uncapping step prior to conjugation (31).
Cysteinylation at Cys538 has been reported by other authors [31, 34], but to our knowledge the
other modifying groups (Table 3) have not previously been reported for RBD. The species with

Cys538 modifications and O-glycoforms detected at protein level (Table 2) were further
confirmed at tryptic peptide level by the in-solution BFD (Table 3).
The usage of culture media with defined composition and a well-characterized downstream
process would avoid unexpected modifications of free cysteine residues (41, 42), otherwise, the
structural assignment for these PTMs would be more difficult according to our knowledge (43).
Although Cys‐capping modifications protect the molecule from aggregation and scrambling
mediated by inter- and intra-molecular disulfide bonds, respectively, it need to be adressed if
the final outcome is to use the unpaired Cys for further modification as for example drug
conjugation process (44, 45). Another issue also to be adressed is the potential protein
heterogeneity if the final intention is the use of the dimer molecule through disulphide bonds
(38, 39, 46, 47).
A low-intensity signal at m/zExp 607.28, 5+ and assigned to (S-S5+538-538) in Fig. 2h, was
exclusively detected when in-solution BFD protocol was applied. It suggests that a minor
fraction of this molecule is a dimer mediated by an intermolecular disulfide bond between two
Cys538 residues. MS/MS of this signal confirmed this assignment (Fig. 3d). This result match with
SDS-PAGE of RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3 ran under reducing and non reducing conditions showing that
a dimer of this molecule repesents 13% of this preparation (Fig. 2a).
The presence of three low abundance scrambling variants (C538-C379, C538-C391, C538-C432) and the
homodimer (C538-C538) of this molecule agrees with the presence of a free Cys538 detected in this
preparation (Table 3). All the previous scrambled species were detected by using the in-solution
BFD protocol, while only the scrambling C538-C391 was detected by the SD protocol. Also, a lowabundance population of the protein with free C336, C391, C432 and C538 was detected by both

protocols. All the above-mentioned assignments of scrambled and free Cys variants were
confimed by the MS/MS spectra (Fig. S4-S5). The presence of an unpaired Cys residues may also
promote disulfide exchange (22) and in consequence generates low-abundance scrambling
variants of the desired molecule.
Our results indicate that Cys reduction and S-alkylation of the RBD protein before MS analysis is
not convenient as important information is lost. The most striking results obtained with the BFD
protocol are the detection of the disulfide-containing peptides (including low-abundance
scrambled variants) and the finding of several modifications linked to free cysteines that
probably, some of them would be missed if reduction of disulfides takes place during sample
preparation.
The analysis of the same gene construct (RBD(319-541)-HEK) for the expression in HEK-293T of the
same protein without the C-terminal spacer arm of three alanines (Table 1) by in-solution SD
and BFD protocol (Fig. S6, Table 2 and S1) yields similar results to that described here for
RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3, at protein and peptide level (Fig. 2, Table 2 and 3). Full-sequence coverage
was achieved in the analysis of RBD(319-541)-HEK by using in solution BFD protocol while using the
SD protocol 85% was achieved (Table 2). C-terminal peptide containing the six histidine tail was
only detected by using BFD protocol (data not shown).
Characterization of (RBD(319-541)-CHO)2
The RBD dimer (RBD(319-541)-CHO)2 resulting from an intermolecular disulfide bond Cys538-Cys538
was originally obtained as a by-product during the attempt to obtain RBD(319-541)-CHO. Unpaired
Cys538 was introduced in order to use it for site selective conjugation to tetanus toxoid (35). The

increased immunogenicity of RBD-dimer (9, 48) promoted their use in at least two vaccines
currently in clinical trials.
The (RBD(319-541)-CHO)2 protein non-treated (lane 2, Fig. 4a) and treated (lane 3, Fig. 4b) with
PNGase F and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions only the presence of a
glycosylated and deglycosylated monomer, respectively, were observed. When the same
samples were analyzed by non-reducing conditions the glycosylated (lane 4, Fig. 4a) and the
deglycosylated (lane 5, Fig. 4a) dimer were observed. This result confirmed the
dimeric and N-glycosylated nature of (RBD(319-541)-CHO)2.
The ESI-MS spectrum of the PNGase F deglycosylated dimer showed the typical multiplycharged ions and suggested certain heterogeneity in the molecule (Fig. 4b). It was more easily
appreciated after the deconvolution process (Fig. 4c) due to the presence of three major signals
corresponding to the three combinations of two short O-glycan chains linked to the dimer as
indicated in Fig. 4c (21). The good agreement observed between the expected and
experimental masses for all these O-glycoforms of (RBD(319-541)-CHO)2 is summarized in Table 2.
ESI-MS analysis of the (RBD(319-541)-CHO)2 (Fig. 4c) suggest that this molecule is more
homogeneous than the monomers RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3 and RBD(319-541)-HEK, probably because
Cys538 is fully compromised in the intermolecular disulfide bond and is not linked to other
blocking groups present in the culture media.
The N-deglycosylated protein was digested with trypsin by using the in-solution SD and BFD
protocols and the resultant ESI-MS spectra are shown in Fig. 4d and 4e, respectively. Fullsequence coverage was achieved for the in-solution BFD protocol while using the SD protocol

only 80.6% of the sequence was verified (Table 2). The assignments for all tryptic peptides
generated by both protocols are summarized in Table S2.
The four disulfide bonds present in the native RBD of SARS-CoV-2 were detected by applying
both protocols (Fig 4d and Fig 4e). O-glycosylated N-terminal peptides (R319-R328 and V320-R328)
with O-glycosylation sites located at Thr323/Ser325 residues (21) were detected with appreciable
intensities (m/zExp 711.34, 3+; 842.90, 2+ and 988.44, 2+ in Fig 4d and Fig 4e). The mass shift
provoked by these O-glycans observed for the N-deglycosylated protein (Fig 4c) agreed with the
one observed at the peptide level (Fig 4d and 4e). Additionally, two low-intensity signals at
m/zExp 616.33, 2+ and 697.36, 2+ assigned to peptide V320-R328 linked to HexNAc and
HexNAc:Hex were detected only by in-solution BFD protocol (Table S2).
The most striking differences between both ESI-MS spectra (Fig 4d and Fig 4e) are observed in
the low-mass region where short and hydrophilic peptides [L455-R457 (m/zExp 218.14, 2+), G404R408 (m/zExp 288.14, 2+), K356-R357 (m/zExp 303.21, 1+) and S530-K535 (m/zExp 331.19, 2+)] were only
detected by applying the in-solution BFD protocol.
The ESI-MS signals that confirm the dimeric nature of (RBD(319-541)-CHO)2 are the corresponding
to the peptide [C538-H547]-S-S-[C538-H547] containing Cys538 and Cys538 linked by intermolecular
disulfide bond (m/zExp 522.02, 5+ and m/zExp 652.29, 4+ in Fig. 4f and Fig. 4g). These signals that
also enabled the verification of the C-terminal end of this molecule were exclusively detected
by applying the in-solution BFD protocol. Probably, the presence of twelve histidine residues in
the structure of [C538-H547]-S-S-[C538-H547] (assigned as S538-S5385+ and S538-S5384+ and in Fig. 4e
and 4f, respectively) makes difficult its retention in the C18-ZipTip during the desalting step
when the in-solution SD protocol is applied. The verification of the C-terminal end of proteins is

a very important aspect included in the ICHQ6B guidelines and requested by regulatory
authorities (18).
Characterization of RBD(331-529)-Ec
The expression of RBD as inclusion bodies in E. coli constitutes a challenge due to the presence
of eight cysteines and the absence of the native N-glycosylation required for the appropriate
expression and folding of the molecule. The non-correctly folded RBD is not useful for a vaccine
against SARS-CoV-2 because a tridimensional structure identical to the native protein is
required to generate upon vaccination neutralizing antibodies recognizing conformational
epitopes (19, 20) in the S protein. For this reason the detection of non-native disulfide bonds is
of tremendous importance for the development of biologically active molecules and wellcharacterized products (18).
SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions (Fig. 5a, lane 2) of RBD(331-529)-Ec shows a band
that migrates with an estimated molecular mass of 27.3 kDa. The good agreement between the
expected (25117.14 Da) and the experimental (25117.44 Da) molecular masses for the reduced
and S-alkylated protein determined by ESI-MS analysis confirmed this result (Fig 5b, and Table
2). However, when RBD(331-529)-Ec was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions
(Fig. 5a, Lane 3) a band with a very high molecular mass between the stacking and separating
gel was observed. Also an smear in the stacking gel suggested the presence of RBD(331-529)-Ec
aggregates mediated by multiple and probably random disulfide bonds. Probably this is the
reason why, we did not succeed in measuring the intact molecular mass of this protein by ESIMS analysis.

For this reason RBD(331-529)-Ec was considered as a positive control to evaluate if the in-solution
BFD protocol (Fig. 1b) might allow the identification of the native and a wide variety of nonnative disulfide bonds in the same ESI-MS spectrum.
ESI-MS analysis of RBD(331-529)-Ec digested with trypsin by using the in-solution BFD protocol
showed several multiply-charged ions signals assigned to peptides containing Cys
corresponding to the four native disulfide bonds (signals written in red and assigned as S-S#-#n+,
Fig. 5c). The good agreement between the expected and experimental molecular masses of
other signals written in black and assigned as S-S#-#n+, (Fig. 5c) were assigned to tryptic peptides
containing scrambled disulfide bonds of RBD(331-529)-Ec (Table S3). The MS/MS spectra that
confirmed these assignments are shown in Fig. S11. Table S3 shows a summary for the
assignment of all signals observed in the ESI-MS spectrum of Fig. 5c.
The charge state (z) of all these signals assigned to peptides linked by scrambled disulfide bonds
was equal or higher than 3+ (S-S, in Fig. 5c). It agrees with a previous observation (49, 50)
showing that in ESI-MS analysis cross-linked peptides generated by tryptic digestion are ionized
preferably with z≥ 3+. Intermolecular disulfide linked peptides are a particular case of crosslinked peptides.
The results shown here demonstrated that in-solution BFD protocol (24) in combination with
ESI-MS analysis of RBD enabled in a single mass spectrum the detection of native disulfide
bonds, the scrambled variants, as well as free cysteine residues that might be responsible for
promoting disulfide exchange and protein aggregation (22). This example is important for a
future validation of this technique according to the ICHQ2R1 guidelines (51). These aspects
fulfills the requirements of regulatory agencies for the development of a well-characterized

product taking into account the importance of this PTM for the ICHQ6B guidelines (18). Ninetynine percent of sequence coverage for RBD(331-529)-Ec was achieved when used the in-solution
BFD protocol.
Characterization of RBD(333-527)-C1
Thermothelomyces heterothallica, was engineered to develop an industrialized protein
production host expression system with high yields (> 10 g/L) of several recombinant proteins
including Mabs, Fc-fusion proteins, virus like particles, etc (14).
This engineered T. heterothallica C1 host expression system has a very significant reduction of
the protease load thus minimizing unwanted degradation during fermentation (14). For these
reasons, the RBD(333-527)-C1 (see Table 1) was expressed in T. heterothallica C1 host expression
system and characterized using the in-solution BFD protocol. Unlike other proteins
characterized in this work, RBD(333-527)-C1 has only one N-glycosylation site located at Asn343.
NP-HPLC profile showed the structural assignment based on the GU indexes for the individual
N-glycans released with PNGase F and labeled with 2AB (Fig. 6a). ESI-MS spectrum
deconvoluted with MaxEnt1 of the intact RBD(333-527)-C1 confirmed the typical heterogeneity of
N-glycoproteins indicating the presence of several non-fucosylated glycoforms (Fig. 6b). The
experimental and expected molecular masses agreed very well (Fig. 6b, Table 2). In both
analyses, the three predominant glycoforms were Man4, Man4A1 and Man5A1, being the last
one the most-abundant.
This protein, after N-deglycosylation with PNGase F and ESI-MS analysis (Fig. S8a), also showed
several multiply charged signals with z=8+ to 15+, that once deconvoluted with MaxEnt1 (Fig.
S8b) yields an intense and unique signal with an experimental molecular mass of 22590.33 Da

(Table 2). This result agrees very well with the expected (22590.26 Da) assuming the RBD(333527)-C1

monomer N-deglycosylated and with four disulfide bonds.

The N-deglycosylated protein digested with trypsin by in-solution BFD protocol (Fig. 6c) and
analyzed by the ESI-MS allowed a full-sequence coverage (Table 2), confirmed the integrity of
the N- and C-terminal ends and allowed the identification of the four native disulfide bonds (SS379-432, S-S336-361, S-S480-488 and S-S391-525, Table S4). Very low-abundance signals (Fig. 6c) were
detected at m/zExp 847.87 (2+) and 1167.52 (2+) and assigned to the peptides T333-R346 and L425K444 containing the Cys336 and Cys432 modified with NEM (Fig. S9). It indicates that a minor
fraction of RBD(333-527)-C1 contains Cys336 and Cys432 with free thiols in the original molecule. In
addition, the same Cys336 and Cys432 were also detected in three low-intensity signals detected
at m/zexp 889.72, 4+; m/zexp 944.43, 4+ and m/zexp 1131.26, 4+ (see Table S4) that were assigned
to (T333-R346)-S-S-(L387-R403), (T333-R346)-S-S-(L425-K444) and (I358-K378)-S-S-(L425-K444) linked by the
scrambled disulfide bonds between Cys336-Cys391, Cys336-Cys432 and Cys361-Cys432, respectively
(Fig. S9). Scrambled Cys361-Cys525 was also detected and the MS/MS spectra supporting these
assignments are shown in Fig. S9. The presence of free cysteine in the molecule probably is the
responsible for the generation of these two low-abundance scrambling variants according to
the mechanisms proposed for the generation of this modification (22).
The size heterogeneity of N-glycans linked to Asn343 in RBD(333-527)-C1 was not revealed by the
trypsin digestion and the ESI-MS analysis of Fig. 6c due to the treatment with PNGase F at the
initial steps of the in-solution BFD protocol. A variant of the in-solution BFD protocol without
the PNGase F treatment did not provided this information either because the N-terminal
peptide (T333-R346) of the RBD(333-527)-C1 containing the glycosylated Asn343 is linked at the same

time to (I358-K378) by a disulfide bond (Cys336-Cys361). Probably, the heterogeneity typical of Nglycopeptides, combined with its high molecular mass (over 4 kDa) and its ionization
suppressed at the same time by the presence of shorter proteolytic peptides make difficult it
detection by ESI-MS analysis.
However, when the N-glycosylated RBD(333-527)-C1 was reduced and S-alkylated with
iodoacetamide and digested using the in-solution BFD all cysteine containing peptides were
detected (Fig. 6d, Table S4) including the N-terminal peptide T333-R346 containing Cys336 and
several glycoforms as shown in the inset of Fig. 6d. MS/MS spectra supporting these
assignments are shown in Fig. S10.
The in-solution BFD protocol achieved 100% sequence coverage (Table 2) when the RBD(333-527)C1 was N-deglycosylated under non-reduced conditions (Fig. 6c) and also when the Nglycoprotein was reduced and carbamidomethylated (Fig. 6d).
Characterization of RBD(331-530)-Cmyc-Pp
RBD of SARS-CoV-2 was also expressed in P. pastoris with a tandem repeat of six histidine
residues and the Cmyc tag fused at the C-terminal end (RBD(331-530)-Cmyc-Pp, see Table 1) to be
used for analytical purposes.
The ESI-MS spectrum of RBD(331-530)-Cmyc-Pp deglycosylated with PNGase F (Fig. 7a) with
charge-states from 9+ to 17+ was deconvoluted (Fig. 7b), yielding an intense signal with a
molecular mass of 25835.29 Da that is 400.88 Da higher than expected (25434.41 Da)
considering the sequence of RBD(331-530)-Cmyc-Pp in Table 1 with four disulfide bonds and two
N-deglycosylated sites. The N-deglycosylated protein was digested with trypsin by the insolution BFD protocol (Fig. 1b) and the resultant ESI-MS spectrum (Fig. 7c) showed an

unexpected signal of appreciable intensity at m/zExp 1219.32, 4+. The MS/MS spectrum of this
signal (Fig. 7d) confirmed that two peptides [EAEAEFS-(D331-R346)-S-S-(I358-R378)] were linked by
an intermolecular disulfide bond between Cys336 and Cys361. One of these peptides [EAEAEFS(D331-R346)] contains an incomplete processed fragment of the alpha mating factor signal
peptide (EAEA-) (52) linked to the expected N-terminal end EFS-(D331-R346) of the mature
RBD(331-530)-Cmyc-Pp. The expected molecular mass of the residues (EAEA-) linked to the Nterminal end (400.39 Da) agrees with the mass difference observed between the experimental
and calculated molecular mass for the N-deglycosylated protein (400.88 Da, Fig 7b).
Table S5 shows a summary for the assignment of all signals observed in the ESI-MS spectrum of
Fig. 7c. Several short and hydrophilic peptides (356KR357; 404GDEVR408; 455LFR457; 530SR531; EQK)
were detected and sequence coverage of 99% (Table 2) was achieved for the in-solution BFD
protocol.
The α-mating factor prepro peptide secretion signal from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is still the
most commonly used signal sequence for recombinant proteins expressed in P. pastoris (53).
Processing of the alpha mating factor should occur in three steps, in particular the last step
involves the Ste13 protein that cleaves the Glu-Ala repeats in the Golgi (54), therefore we
speculate that this step was interrupted in some way, as all the purified protein was detected
exclusively with the EAEA- linked to the N-terminal end. Probably the high expression level of
this protein (40 g/L) impaired the complete processing of the signal peptide.
In-solution BFD enabled the detection of incomplete processing of the signal peptide of RBD
expressed in P. pastoris, an expression system of choice for vaccine development due to the
ease of genetic manipulation, the capability to perform complex post-translational

modifications and, at the same time, obtain high expression yield (12). The characterization of
the N-terminal end is also one of the aspects requested by the ICHQ6B guidelines (18).
Artificial modifications introduced during sample processing by the in-solution BFD protocol
In the characterization of all RBDs by using in-solution BFD protocol we initially used acetone
for protein precipitation (Fig. 1b). We noticed in the ESI-MS spectra an unexpected doublycharged signal at m/zExp 629.81 (Fig 8a) having a variable intensity. This signal was not detected
when RBDs were processed by using in-solution SD protocol (Fig. 2d, 4d and S6c) and when the
protein precipitation step (Fig. 1b) was carried out with cold ethanol (Fig. 8b) instead of
acetone (Fig. 8a).
Comparison between the MS/MS spectra of the unmodified peptide (445VGGNYNYLYR454, m/zExp
609.80, 2+, Fig. 8c) and the signal detected at m/zExp 629.81, 2+ (Fig. 8d) revealed that it
corresponds to the same internal peptide (Val445-Arg454) modified by adding 40 Da alternatively
at Gly446 (445V[G+40]GNYNYLYR454) and at the N-terminal end (445[V+40]GGNYNYLYR454).
The ions detected at m/zExp 1119.54 (y9), m/zExp 140.10 (b1+40) and m/zExp 112.10 (immonium
ion of [445Val+40]) exclusively observed in the MS/MS spectrum of the modified peptide (Fig.
8d) support the presence of the +40 Da at the N-terminal end.
Also, in the same MS/MS spectra (Fig. 8d), the ion detected at m/zExp 1159.54 (y9+40 Da), and
the immonium ion of valine (Val) suggest the coexistence of a second specie with the intact Nterminal 455Val. In addition, the presence of fragment ions of series bn+40 (b2+40 Da to b7+40 Da)
and several internal ions, only detected in Fig. 8d at m/zExp 70.06 (G+40), m/zExp 155. 08
([G+40]G), m/zExp 269.12 ([G+40]GN), m/zExp 432.19 ([G+40]GNY), suggest that the modification
of 40 Da mass is also present at the second position (G+40) (Fig. 8d).

Although in literature a structure for this modification has not been proposed yet, a previous
work noticed that it is specific only for those peptides having Gly at position n+2 that were
derived from tryptic digests of proteins previously precipitated with acetone (55). All RBDs
characterized here have only one internal tryptic peptide 445VG*GNYNYLYR454 with this
characteristic.
The acetone traces that remains adhered in the pellet, during trypsin digestion at 37 oC for 16
hours, are the responsible for this modification (55). The intensity of this modified peptide can
be reduced considerably if a 15 minutes vacuum drying step is inserted in the protocol after
acetone protein precipitation. However, care should be taken because an extensive drying
makes more difficult dissolving the protein pellet in water/acetonitrile as required for an
efficient in-solution BFD protocol.
In-solution BFD of proteins precipitated with ethanol and acetone yield very similar results and
they can be used indistinctively. However, during the analysis of RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3 after
acetone precipitation, the isotopic ion distributions of the modified 445Val-Arg454 + 40 Da
peptide (m/zExp 629.81, 2+, Fig. 8a) and the C-terminal peptide (538CVNF541-AAAHHHHHH)
carrying a +374 Da modification at Cys538 (Fig. 8b) were partially overlapped thus it impaired its
detection. This modification at Cys538 was only detected when the protein RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3
was precipitated with ethanol and analyzed by in-solution BFD (Fig. 8b).
Another artifact originated by the sample processing was the partial addition of NEM to the Nterminal end of the RBD proteins despite maleimide has 1000 fold selectivity for thiols over
amine groups at neutral pH (56).

The addition of NEM was verified by ESI-MS analyses of the RBD deglycosylated with PNGase F
(Table 3) and confirmed by the ESI-MS/MS analysis of the N-terminal tryptic glycopeptides (Fig.
S11). Despite the abundant fragmentation of glycans in the MS/MS of Fig. S11, three bn ions (b1,
b3 and b4) containing the N-terminal end of the peptide R319-R328 increased its masses by in 125
Da due to the addition of NEM were detected. In addition, the cysteinylated RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3
also partially added two molecules of NEM, one at the N-terminal end of Arg319 and a second
one to the N-terminal end of Cys linked to Cys538 (Fig. 8e).
The ESI-MS/MS spectrum shown in Fig. 8e confirm this finding because it corresponds to the Cterminal peptide (538CVNF541-AAAHHHHHH, m/zExp 587.92, 3+) of RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3 linked by a
disulfide bond to a cysteine residue that contains a modifying NEM group (+125 Da) at its Nterminal end. The symmetric dissociation of the disulfide bond yields the reduced 538CVNF541AAAHHHHHH (m/zExp 759.37, 2+ assigned as P1-SH2+) and the reduced NEM-C-OH (m/zExp
247.08, 1+, assigned as P2-SH). Several daughter ions originated by the asymmetric
fragmentation of the disulfide bond (1a2, 1b21b41b2b3SH) confirmed that the N-terminal
end of 538CVNF541-AAAHHHHHH is free while two other fragment ions (2 and 2) confirm that
NEM is located at the N-terminal end of the cysteine residue that is linked by an intermolecular
disulfide bond to Cys538.
Using the in-solution BFD protocol (Fig. 1b) the remaining internal tryptic peptides were not
modified with NEM at their N-terminal ends because this S-alkylating reagent was eliminated
during sample precipitation and the subsequent washing steps before proceeding to the
proteolytic digestion. However, three low-intensity signals in the ESI-MS analysis of tryptic
digestion corresponding to peptides 356KR357 (m/zExp 428.26, 1+), 458KSNLKPFER466 (m/zExp

622.36, 2+) and 529KSTNLVK535 (m/zExp 457.78, 2+) with the epsilon amino group of Lys356, Lys458
and Lys529 modified with NEM (+125 Da) were detected using the in-solution BFD protocol and
confirmed by MS/MS (Fig. S12). On the contrary, when the RBD is digested in-solution by using
the SD protocol and NEM is present even at a very low concentration (≤5 mM) during all sample
processing it will be added to the N-terminal end of most of the internal tryptic peptides (data
not shown).
NEM is added in excess at a concentration of 5 mM and it remains during the N-deglycosylation
step (2 h at 37 oC) at a pH slightly over neutral (7.2-7.4). It seems that these conditions make
favorable this side reaction in a considerable fraction of the N-terminal end of the
deglycosylated RBD as well as for the cysteine linked by disulfide bond to Cys538. In a minor
extension the epsilon amino groups of Lys residues were modified. Therefore, the partial
addition of NEM at the N-terminal end of the protein is a side reaction to be considered when
in-solution BFD is used.
The hydrolysis of thiosuccinimide ring after adding the NEM to free Cys residues in protein was
also observed probably more appreciable when the digestion of the analyzed RBD was carried
out by the SD protocol at basic pH (Fig. 1a) (57). This side reaction increased the molecular
masses of peptides by 18 Da.
Conclusions
In-solution BFD allowed in a single ES-MS spectrum, the full-sequence coverage for most
recombinant RBD sequences characterized in this work and outperformed, in this aspect, the
in-solution SD protocol. Hydrophobic and the hydrophilic peptides were simultaneously and
efficiently detected in the same ESI-MS spectrum only when BFD protocol was used.

The in-solution BFD protocol implemented in combination with ESI-MS analysis has
demonstrated to be sensitive for the detection of PTMs (N- and O-glycosylation, and several
modifications linked to the free Cys538) present in the recombinant RBDs produced in different
expression systems (mammalian cells, fungus, yeast and bacteria). In an RBD with the unpaired
Cys538 several PTMs were only detected when in-solution BFD was applied.
In particular, the identification of the C-terminal end of proteins containing a tandem repeat of
six histidine residues, an important aspect requested in the ICHQ6B guidelines, was always
possible by the in-solution BFD while with the SD sample processing the identification was not
achieved in all proteins.
Artifacts introduced during the application of the in-solution BFD protocol like the one
provoked by acetone (+40 Da) and the N-terminal modification with NEM (+125 Da) were well
characterized and the sources that originate them were readily identified. In particular, the
artifact of +40 Da in an internal peptide of RBD (445VG*GNYNYLYR454) can be eliminated if
ethanol precipitation is used instead of acetone. Other S-alkylating agents might be also used
alternatively depending the preferences of the labs, but was not explored here.
We believe that the results obtained in this study, suggest that in-solution BFD protocol in
combination with ESI-MS deserve to be validated for the characterization of RBDs used as
active pharmaceutical ingredients of SARS-CoV-2 subunit-based vaccines. This protocol is simple
and can be easily implemented because it essentially employs reagents frequently used for the
characterization of proteins by MS.
MALDI-MS in principle, can also be used in combination with the in-solution BFD, however the
detection of some low molecular mass peptides in somehow might be troublesome due to

matrix interference. Probably the usage of blank mass spectra might be useful to obtain reliable
results.
We foresee that the current BFD protocol can also be applicable to the analysis of active
pharmaceutical ingredients of other recombinant RBD-based subunit vaccines customized for
SARS-CoV-2 with point mutations (58) or other mutants generated by virus recombination
phenomena (59). In particular, it could be of relevance in a context where vaccination
constitutes a tremendous selective pressure for the onset of virus mutants and probably new
subunit-based vaccine candidates might be required as it is the case of seasonable vaccines
required for immunization against influenza.

shown in (c) correspond to the RBD(333-527)-C1 treated with PNGase F and digested following the
in-solution BFD protocol shown in Fig. 1b. The ESI-MS spectrum shown in (d) correspond to the
reduced and S-alkylated glycosylated RBD(333-527)-C1. Signals assigned as (C#+cam)n+ correspond
to tryptic peptides containing carbamidomethyl cysteine residues at position #. The inset shown

due to the action of PNGase F. The nomenclature for the fragment ions observed in the MS/MS
spectrum agrees with the proposed by Mormann et al (61).

Fig. 8 The ESI-MS spectra shown in (a) and (b) correspond to expanded regions of the tryptic
peptides derived from RBD(319-541)-HEK_A3 digested by in-solution BFD protocol after
precipitation with acetone and ethanol, respectively. The signals assigned in (b) as (C538+ECG)3+
and (C538+374 Da)3+ correspond to the C-terminal peptide 538CVNF541-AAAHHHHHH with the C538
modified with glutathione and a chemical modification of unknown chemical nature that
increased its molecular mass in 374 Da, respectively. The MS/MS spectra shown in (c) and (d)
correspond to the internal non-modified Val445-Arg454 peptide (m/z 609.80, 2+) and the same
peptide with a modification that increased its molecular mass by 40.02 Da (m/z 629.81, 2+),
respectively. This chemical modification introduced in the precipitation step with acetone is
located alternatively at the N-terminal end (V+40) or at the second position glycine (G+40). The
MS/MS spectra shown in (e) correspond to the cysteinylated peptide C-terminal end peptide
(538CVNF541-AAAHHHHHH) with the C538 linked by a disulfide bond (-S-S-) to a Cys residue (C-OH)
modified at the N-terminal end with an N-ethylmaleimide group (NEM-) introduced during the
sample processing. Peptide and C-OH have been assigned as P1 and P2, respectively. The
nomenclature of fragment ions is in agreement with the proposed by Mormann et al (61).

(a) The three alanine and six histidine residues located at the C-terminal end (residues 542-550) of
the protein do not correspond to the RBD and were inserted in the cloning stage to facilitate the
purification process of the recombinant protein by using IMAC. The superscript numbers
indicate the location of the tryptic peptides within the analyzed protein. A brief description of
the PTMs linked to the corresponding peptides is included. NEM: N-ethylmaleimide, CNEM
cysteine alkylated with N-ethylmaleimide at the thiol group. Nt and Ct indicates an N- and Cterminal end. The residues indicated as D correspond to potential N-glycosylation sites located
at Asn331 and Asn343 that were transformed into Asp by PNGase F.
(b) Monosaccharide symbols follow the SNFG system (60) and the O-glycans structures as
previously reported (36).
