Abstract

29

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome

30

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently the most pressing medical and socioeconomic challenge.

31

Constituting important correlates of protection, determination of virus-neutralizing antibodies

32

(NAbs) is indispensable for convalescent plasma selection, vaccine candidate evaluation, and

33

immunity certificates. In contrast to standard serology ELISAs, plaque reduction neutralization

34

tests (PRNTs) are laborious, time-consuming, expensive, and restricted to specialized laboratories.

35

To replace microscopic counting-based SARS-CoV-2 PRNTs by a novel assay exempt from

36

genetically modified viruses, which are inapplicable in most diagnostics departments, we

37

established a simple, rapid, and automated SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay employing an in-cell

38

ELISA (icELISA) approach.

39

After optimization of various parameters such as virus-specific antibodies, cell lines, virus doses,

40

and duration of infection, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells became amenable as direct antigen source

41

for quantitative icELISA. Using commercially available nucleocapsid protein-specific antibodies,

42

viral infection could easily be quantified in human and highly permissive Vero E6 cells by

43

icELISA. Antiviral agents such as human sera containing NAbs or antiviral interferons dose-

44

dependently reduced the SARS-CoV-2-specific signal. Applying increased infectious doses, the

45

icNT was superior to PRNT in discriminating convalescent sera with high from those with

46

intermediate neutralizing capacities.

47

The SARS-CoV-2 icELISA test allows rapid (<48h in total, read-out in seconds) and automated

48

quantification of virus infection in cell culture to evaluate the efficacy of NAbs as well as antiviral

49

drugs, using reagents and equipment present in most routine diagnostics departments. We propose

50

the icELISA and the icNT for COVID-19 research and diagnostics.

Introduction

52

By the time of writing, more than 6.3 million people experienced a laboratory confirmed infection

53

with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 and more than 378,000

54

people died while having coronavirus infectious disease 19 (COVID-19). First surveillance studies

55

and calculations of excess mortality rates indicate that the precise number of infections and the

56

true number of fatalities exceed above-mentioned numbers by far.

57

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive strand RNA viruses widespread among various vertebrate hosts

58

including bats and rodents (1). Together with four seasonal human CoVs (hCoVs) as well as the

59

two other emerging hCoVs SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh hCoV

60

causing widespread human diseases (2). In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 was first recognized in

61

the Hubei province in China (3) from where it rapidly spread throughout the world. In addition to

62

its genetic similarity, SARS-CoV-2 shares some clinical characteristics with SARS-CoV-1 (4), but

63

also exhibits some highly relevant particularities such as an increased spreading efficacy and the

64

length of the course of disease (5). On January 31, the WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak

65

a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On March 11, 2020, WHO started to denote

66

the outbreak a global pandemic. Since its beginning, the centre of the pandemic shifted from China,

67

via Europe and Northern Americas to Central and Southern Americas. This dynamic nature of the

68

pandemic poses an inherent danger of repetitive local and temporal reintroduction circles. Thus,

69

even countries which coped relatively well with the first wave must prepare in terms of diagnostics

70

capacities for potential future re-emergences.

71

Most SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to mild or moderate illnesses. However, a considerable fraction

72

of cases proceeds to severe pneumonia or life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome.

73

Elderly individuals and people with pre-existing comorbidities such as impaired immunity, chronic

74

respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer are more prone to suffer from severe

75

COVID-19. The case fatality rate (CFR) is difficult to calculate in the midst of the pandemic.

76

Depending on the age, CFR estimates of up to 18.4% for individuals older than 80 years and 1.38%

77

(range 1.23 - 1.53) for the general population have been reported (6).

78

Given the extent, pace, and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, diagnostics departments even in

79

countries with highly developed medical systems struggle to provide sufficient and timely test

80

capacities. Since nucleic acid-based pathogen detection, usually by quantitative RT-PCR based on

81

naso- or oropharyngeal swabs, has a very short window of opportunity, assays detecting long-

82

lasting immune responses such as antibodies are required to monitor virus spread and to estimate

83

potential herd immunity.

84

With some delay, most infected individuals raise a detectable humoral immune response including

85

specific immunoglobulins (Ig) M, IgA, and IgG (7-9). Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) bind and

86

abrogate the function of viral proteins such as the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein that are essential

87

for virus entry into host cells, e.g., through recognition of the cognate receptor ACE2 (10).

88

Accordingly, monoclonal NAbs exhibit strong therapeutic and prophylactic efficacies in SARS-

89

CoV-2-infected human ACE2-transgenic mice (11). A recent vaccination study conducted in non-

90

human primates identified NAbs as correlate of protection (12), indicating that a human SARS-

91

CoV-2 vaccine should also be capable to elicit potent NAb responses. Additionally, monoclonal

92

NAbs and NAb-containing hyper-immunoglobulin preparations may be applicable as treatment

93

against COVID-19 (13). NAbs are also the backbone of convalescent plasma (CP) therapies (14-

94

16) that are one of 7 clinical recommendations of the IDSA (17). Based on the havoc COVID-19

95

causes to the global economy, immunity passports and vaccination certificates, documenting

96

protection through NAbs, have been discussed (e.g., (18)). Taken together, SARS-CoV-2-specific

97

NAbs and their quantification appear to be of central importance for the medical and socio-

98

economic management of the pandemic.

99

Different types of neutralization tests (NT) have been developed for SARS-CoV-2. However, to

100

our knowledge, these assays rely on laborious microscopic counting of virus plaques or antibody-

101

stained foci by trained personnel (19-21) or on genetically modified viruses such as transgenic

102

SARS-CoV-2 mutants (22) or pseudo-typed viruses (e.g., Vesicular stomatitis virus [VSV] or

103

Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) expressing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (23, 24).

104

Genetically modified viruses are generally prohibited in routine diagnostics laboratories and

105

usually not applicable in less developed regions. Due to the central importance of NAbs and the

106

limitations of the currently available methodology, we established a cheap, simple, fast, reliable,

107

and automatable in-cell ELISA (icELISA)-based icNT applicable in most routine diagnostics

108

departments.

Methods

111

Cells, viruses, interferons, and sera

112

Caco-2 (ATCC HTB-37) and Vero E6 (ATCC CRL-1586) were cultivated in Roswell Park

113

Memorial Institute (RPMI) and Dulbecco`s minimal essential medium (DMEM), respectively,

114

supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37¬∞C in an atmosphere of 5%

115

CO. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from a patient sample using Vero E6 and confirmed by SARS-

116

CoV-2 diagnostic qRT-PCR. Viral titers were determined by TCID50 titration. Human IFNŒ±2 and

117

IFNŒ≤ were purchased from PBL Assay Science (#11101) and Peprotech (#300-02BC),

118

respectively. The collection of serum samples has been approved by the ethics committee of the

119

medical faculty of the University of Duisburg- Essen (20-9208-BO). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG

120

antibodies were detected using ELISA detecting SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (Euroimmun

121

Medizinische Labordiagnostika, Germany) according to manufacturer‚Äôs instructions

122

SARS-CoV-2 icELISA and icNT

123

Defined doses of SARS-CoV-2 were incubated with different serum dilutions for 1 h at 37¬∞C prior

124

to Vero E6 infection. Neutralizing capacities were evaluated by icELISA. A detailed icELISA/

125

icNT protocol is provided in Suppl. File 1. The Œ±-N mAb1 (ABIN6952435), Œ±-N mAb2

126

(ABIN6952433), Œ±-S Ab (ABIN1031551), and POD-coupled secondary antibodies (Dianova)

127

were used.

Results

130

Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 replication and its inhibition by antiviral compounds using

131

icELISA

132

We hypothesized that virus-encoded proteins expressed by infected cells should be amenable as

133

source of viral antigens for the detection and quantification by ELISA. We optimized the

134

experimental conditions such as cell type, virus dose, infection period, cell fixation method,

135

blocking reagent, as well as type and concentrations of primary and secondary antibodies (Fig. 1

136

and data not shown). As described in the Methods section and provided as detailed laboratory

137

protocol in the supplementary information (Suppl. File 1), we compared different commercially

138

available antibodies for the icELISA-based quantification of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Based on

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.05.135806; this version posted June 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

139

existing data on virus entry (10), we infected human Caco-2 cells with graded virus doses (ranging

140

from 0.03125 to 2 PFU/cell). At 3 days post infection (d p .i.), we fixed and stained the cells with

141

different antibodies either recognizing the S or the N protein of SARS-CoV-2. In accordance with

142

high expression level of the N protein (25, 26), certain N-specific mouse IgGs exhibited a signal-

143

to-noise ratio favourable for icELISA (Fig. 1A). A comparison of Vero E6 and human Caco-2

144

cells revealed that the icELISA is applicable to different cells (Fig. 1B).

145

Since the icELISA signal directly correlated with viral replication and viral antigen expression, we

146

tested its ability to determine antiviral effects. Human Caco-2 cells were treated with graded

147

concentrations of human interferon (IFN) Œ±2 or IFNŒ≤ and infected 3 h later with SARS-CoV-2. At

148

3 d p.i., viral antigen amounts were quantified by icELISA. In accordance with a recent clinical

149

phase 2 trial (27), IFNŒ≤ exhibited strong and dose-dependent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-

150

2 in human cells (Fig. 1C), indicating that the icELISA is applicable for future experiments

151

addressing the efficacy of potential antiviral drugs in human cells.

152

Despite different start MOIs, similar icELISA signals were observed at 72 h p.i. in Vero E6 (Fig.

153

1B), indicating multiple rounds of virus amplification and extraordinary fast replication kinetics

154

of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells, consistent with previous studies (28). To test if shorter infection

155

periods might result in virus dose-dependent signals, we analysed infected Vero E6 cells after 6,

156

15, and 22 h. SARS-CoV-2 was readily detectable in Vero E6 cells by icELISA already at 6 h p.i.

157

(Fig. 1D-F).

158

Taken together, these data indicate that the icELISA allowed rapid identification and quantification

159

of SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 and human cells as well as its inhibition by antiviral

160

compounds.

161

Neutralization tests based on icELISA allow the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs as early as 6

162

hours post infection

163

Since the icELISA allowed simple and automated quantification of SARS-CoV-2-dependent

164

antigen expression, we tested if an icELISA-based neutralization test (icNT) can be established.

165

We infected Vero E6 cells for 6, 15, and 24 h with graded SARS-CoV-2 infection doses (500,

166

5000 or 50,000 PFU/well) in the absence or presence of 2 convalescent sera in 3 different

167

concentrations (1/20, 1/40, and 1/80 dilution). Using the high infectious dose, viral antigens

168

became dose-dependently detectable by icELISA as early as 6 h p.i. (Fig. 2A). Both immune sera

169

strongly and dose-dependently neutralized the virus-induced signal (Fig. 2B). At 15 h p.i., the

170

intermediate infectious virus dose also became detectable (Fig. 2C) and both human sera

171

efficiently neutralized the infection (Fig. 2D). At 24 h p.i., all infection conditions resulted in a

172

strong icELISA signal (Fig. 2E), indicating that infectious doses as low as 500 PFU/well are

173

detectable by icELISA after 24 h of infection. Even the strong icELISA signal at 24 h p.i. was

174

dose-dependently neutralized by both sera (Fig. 2F). Please note that the neutralizing capacity of

175

given sera dilutions was less pronounced at higher virus doses as compared to lower virus doses,

176

as indicated by residual icELISA signals.

177

Taken together, the icELISA resulted in a time- and virus dose-dependent signal constituting a

178

surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. The fact that the infection and the resulting

179

icELISA signal were neutralized by NAbs present in immune sera indicated that the fast and

180

automated icELISA format is applicable for icNTs.

181

The icNT results correlate with the standard SARS-CoV-2 neutralization test conducted by staining

182

of virus foci and microscopic counting

183

Although most SARS-CoV-2 NTs have not been formally validated and certified, classic plaque

184

reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) are currently considered to represent the gold standard for

185

the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs. Various commercially available IgM, IgA, and IgG

186

ELISAs have been compared to PRNTs (e.g., (28)). To validate the novel icNT, 20 sera - 10

187

positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG as determined using the Euroimmun ELISA (ELISA ratio:

188

1.26 to 11.39) and 10 ELISA-negative sera (ELISA ratio < 0.9) - were compared side-by-side by

189

icNT and standard PRNT using 200 PFU/well (Fig. 3A). One set was processed by icNT, while

190

for the other set virus foci were stained using an antibody-based AEC staining method and

191

manually counted by microscopy. The icNT correctly recognized all 10 positive and all 10 negative

192

sera (Fig. 3B), indicating optimal sensitivity and specificity. In total, both methods gave almost

193

congruent results in terms of the highest dilution resulting in 50% neutralization (Pearson‚Äôs

194

correlation coefficient 0.965), highlighting excellent test performances of the icNT compared to

195

the PRNT.

196

The icNT discriminates SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing sera from non-immune sera and provides

197

superior resolution when increased virus doses are used

198

Standard SARS-CoV-2 NTs base on microscopic counting of plaques or antibody-stained virus

199

foci. To enable plaque/foci recognition and individual counting by trained personnel, a countable

200

number of PFU must be applied in PRNTs. Depending on the PRNT protocol, 100 (19) to 400

201

PFU (20) are used to infect each well. Based on previous experiences with virus neutralization

202

experiments (29, 30), we suspected that lower infectious doses might be more susceptible to NAbs

203

than higher virus doses, e.g., through altered ratios of NAbs and antigenic regions determining

204

neutralization, such as the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. To

205

address if the icNT can provide superior resolution in terms of discriminating intermediate from

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.05.135806; this version posted June 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

206

strong NAb responses in convalescent sera, we selected prototypical sera and conducted

207

comparative icNTs applying either 200 PFU/well or 40-fold more virus (8000 PFU/well). While

208

all positive sera clearly neutralized the low infectious dose of 200 PFU/well (Fig. 4A-C), the

209

neutralizing capacity of the same sera considerably differed at the more restrictive high virus dose

210

(Fig. 4D-F). Despite their neutralizing capacity at low dose infections, some of the convalescent

211

sera (e.g., serum #19) almost did not show appreciable neutralization in high MOI infection and

212

did not reach the typical benchmark of 50% neutralization at a 1/8 serum dilution. Thus, we

213

concluded that the icNT principle allows higher infectious doses which appear to discriminate

214

intermediate from superior SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titres.

215
216

Discussion

217

We established a novel icELISA-based test principle for detection and quantification of SARS-

218

CoV-2. Given the excellent signal-to-noise ratio between infected and uninfected cells, the test

219

was applicable to quantify the efficacy of antiviral compounds, here shown for IFNŒ≤, and SARS-

220

CoV-2-specific NAbs present in immune sera.

221

Compared to icELISA and icNT, standard virus titrations and PRNTs are far more laborious, time

222

consuming, and expensive - not to speak from subjective and expectation biases upon usage for

223

research. The entire icNT can be processed in less than 2 days including the infection period. Given

224

that the protocol includes an early fixation step using 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde which

225

inactivates SARS-CoV-2, all subsequent steps can be processed outside the biosafety level 3

226

laboratory. The actual data acquisition is conducted within seconds, using standard ELISA plate

227

readers present in most routine diagnostics departments. The icELISA and icNT provide increased

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.05.135806; this version posted June 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

228

data quality and precision by generating continuous data sets. Since the detection antibodies can

229

be applied in icELISA and icNTs in relatively high dilutions (1/5000 and 1/2000 of primary and

230

secondary antibody, respectively), the assay is relatively cheap (in our case, around 0.10 ‚Ç¨ per well

231

for both antibodies and the TMB peroxidase ELISA substrate). The specificity of the icELISA and

232

icNT is provided by the defined SARS-CoV-2 added to the cell cultures on purpose. The primary

233

and secondary detection antibodies just serve to visualize and quantify viral antigens. Thus, SARS-

234

CoV-2-specific antibodies can be applied for icELISA detection notwithstanding potential cross-

235

recognition of other CoVs such as hCoV-HKU1 or hCoV-OC43 - simply because these viruses

236

are not present in the culture. Obviously, such antibodies recognizing conserved residues cannot

237

be used for classic antigen-recognizing ELISAs due to their inability to discriminate coronaviruses.

238

More virus (>1 PFU/cell) can be applied to icNTs. Such high-PFU icNTs scrutinize the virus-

239

neutralizing capacity of sera more strictly, enabling a higher resolution compared to PRNT assays

240

which all rely on low virus numbers. It is tempting to speculate that sera exhibiting superior

241

neutralization in high PFU icNT might be more beneficial in CP therapies.

242

NTs based on pseudo-typed viruses using heterologous expression of the SARS-CoV-2-encoded

243

S by viruses may have certain advantages. However, genetically modified viruses are inapplicable

244

by law in various routine diagnostics departments and usually unavailable in less developed

245

countries. Without the use of genuine infectious viruses, assays relying on pseudo-typed viruses

246

do not fully interrogate the full spectrum of antiviral effects for example if other viral proteins

247

influence the system, e.g., by complement activation (31).

248

Taken together, we propose the icELISA and icNT for the quantification of SARS-CoV-2

249

replication and its inhibition by NAbs and antiviral compounds. By changing the detection

250

antibody, the test principle is transferable to all other viruses.

Figure 1: The icELISA test allows quantification of SARS-CoV-2 replication and its
inhibition by antiviral compounds
(A) Caco-2 cells were infected with indicated doses of SARS-CoV-2. At 3 d p.i., cells were fixed
and detected by icELISA using S- and N-specific primary antibodies. For all further icELISAs, Œ±N mAb1 was used. (B) Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells were infected with indicated doses of SARSCoV-2. At 3 d p.i., cells were analysed by icELISA. (C) Caco-2 cells were treated with indicated
concentrations of IFNŒ±2 or IFNŒ≤. At 3 h post treatment, cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2
(MOI 0.1). Viral replication was evaluated at 3 d p.i. by icELISA. (D - F) Vero E6 cells were
infected with indicated doses of SARS-CoV-2. At 6, 15, and 22 h p.i. (D, E, and F, respectively),
cells were analysed by icELISA. Bars depict the mean values. Dots show the values of the
individual measurements.

Figure 2: The icNT allows the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs as early as 6 h p.i.
(A - F) 500, 5000, and 50,000 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 were incubated with indicated dilutions of 2
convalescent sera for 1 h before Vero E6 cells were infected. At 6 h p.i. (A, B), 15 h p.i. (C, D),
and 24 h p.i. (E, F), cells were analysed by icELISA to evaluate the neutralizing capacity of the
sera. (A, C, E) Bars depict the mean values. Dots show the values of the individual measurements.
(B, D, F) All mean values of the different serum dilutions and virus doses were depicted in one
diagram to compare the influence of the input virus amount on the course of the curve. Light grey,
500 PFU. Grey, 5000 PFU. Dark grey, 50,000 PFU.

Figure 3: The icNT results correlate with the standard SARS-CoV-2 neutralization test
(A) Schematic representation of AEC stain-based classic NT and icELISA-based icNT. NAb,
neutralizing antibody. PRNT, plaque reduction neutralization test. POD, peroxidase. AEC, 3amino-9-ethylcarbazole. TMB, tetramethylbenzidine. (B) 200 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 were
incubated with different dilutions (1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, 1/128, 1/256) of 20 serum samples (10
negatively and 10 positively tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG by Euroimmun ELISA) for 1 h before
Vero E6 were infected. At 20 and 48 h p.i., neutralizing capacity was evaluated by icELISA and
AEC staining with subsequent microscopic counting, respectively. The highest dilution capable to
neutralize 50% of input virus was determined and results of PRNT and icNT were compared.

Figure 4: The icNT provides superior resolution upon usage of increased virus doses
(A - F) 200 or 8,000 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 were incubated with indicated dilutions of serum
samples for 1 h before Vero E6 cells were infected. At 20 and 16 h p.i. (for 200 and 8,000 PFU,
respectively), neutralizing capacity was evaluated by icELISA. Samples measured on the same
plate are depicted in one diagram. The control serum was used as reference for all plates.
